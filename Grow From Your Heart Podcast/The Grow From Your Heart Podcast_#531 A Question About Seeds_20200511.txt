[00:00.000 --> 00:01.940]  All right, here we go.
[00:01.940 --> 00:03.240]  Welcome back, Podcast World.

[00:47.780 --> 00:51.120]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:51.120 --> 00:56.240]  Today, I've been taking dabs of banana orange cookies, full spectrum extract from Green
[00:56.240 --> 00:57.240]  Dot Labs.
[00:57.240 --> 00:59.040]  I've got a big 4-gram jar.
[00:59.040 --> 01:03.300]  On the package, it says it is a blend of banana cush and orange cookies.
[01:03.300 --> 01:06.700]  The flavor is described as banana orange smoothie.
[01:06.700 --> 01:09.160]  I'm going to say that is perfectly accurate.
[01:09.160 --> 01:13.320]  It's like a banana orange smoothie with a hint of pepper at the end of it.
[01:13.320 --> 01:15.600]  I think that is coming from the cookies.
[01:15.600 --> 01:17.600]  There is the orange cookies in here.
[01:17.600 --> 01:21.580]  That peppery, dark undertone at the end comes from the cookies.
[01:21.580 --> 01:25.120]  The orange banana smoothie is dominant, and I really enjoy it.
[01:25.120 --> 01:27.320]  I'll show you the jar here on the screen.
[01:27.320 --> 01:29.020]  If I can get this open, there you go.
[01:29.020 --> 01:33.760]  That is the banana orange cookies from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[01:33.760 --> 01:41.500]  On the back of the container, it says that the product does contain 69.37% THC and non-detectable
[01:41.500 --> 01:43.120]  amounts of CBD.
[01:43.120 --> 01:48.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I'm going to read a couple of emails.
[01:48.160 --> 01:52.640]  Before we get there, let's do some shout-outs to a few of the folks who support the show
[01:52.640 --> 01:54.460]  on Patreon.
[01:54.460 --> 01:57.500]  Let's start off by giving a giant shout-out to our friend Nurse Geek.
[01:57.500 --> 02:00.160]  I want to send a giant thank you shout-out to Growing Granny.
[02:00.160 --> 02:02.820]  I've always got a giant shout-out for my buddy Bobby C.
[02:02.820 --> 02:05.700]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Lernin and Burnin.
[02:05.700 --> 02:08.300]  I want to send a big thank you shout-out to Big Toe Grows.
[02:08.300 --> 02:10.980]  How about a big fist bump and a thank you to Ryan M.
[02:10.980 --> 02:13.400]  I've always got a big thank you shout-out for Sephirot.
[02:13.400 --> 02:15.900]  We need to send a special thank you to HD Chop.
[02:15.900 --> 02:20.060]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you
[02:20.060 --> 02:22.780]  shout-out to my friend Paul T.
[02:22.940 --> 02:26.260]  Big thank you, big shout-out for everybody who supports the show.

[02:38.160 --> 02:42.580]  And I did include a link in the show notes for all of my stoned friends just to make
[02:42.580 --> 02:43.580]  it easy.
[02:43.580 --> 02:44.580]  Thank you guys.

[02:49.620 --> 02:51.580]  I do appreciate all of your support.
[02:52.100 --> 02:56.580]  All right, before we go much further, I want to send a big thank you to my buddy Mike.
[02:56.580 --> 03:00.220]  White Mike spent some time learning how to work some audio equipment.
[03:00.220 --> 03:03.180]  He learned some time, he took some time setting some stuff up.
[03:03.180 --> 03:05.420]  He found some space, some quiet time.
[03:05.420 --> 03:09.460]  And we have been recording shows here on Zoom and they will be appearing on YouTube.
[03:09.460 --> 03:14.380]  They will also be in the Apple Podcast and Stitcher podcast feed.
[03:14.380 --> 03:17.260]  But Mike did a great job on episode 530.
[03:17.260 --> 03:20.940]  I want to send a big thanks to Mike for the fucking great show.
[03:20.980 --> 03:21.980]  Episode 530 was awesome.
[03:21.980 --> 03:22.980]  Good job, bro.
[03:22.980 --> 03:23.980]  You did a really good job.
[03:23.980 --> 03:27.300]  Also, thank you to everybody who listened and for all of the comments.
[03:27.300 --> 03:29.660]  We got a great response to episode 530.
[03:29.660 --> 03:31.700]  People really seem to like seeing Mike on camera.
[03:31.700 --> 03:34.620]  So you guys send him a lot more words of encouragement.
[03:34.620 --> 03:35.940]  Send him a lot more thanks.
[03:35.940 --> 03:37.740]  Let's get him on a lot more shows.
[03:37.740 --> 03:39.140]  All right, big shout out to Mike.
[03:39.140 --> 03:43.720]  And if you missed it, episode 530, I did a full interview with White Mike.
[03:43.720 --> 03:44.980]  We learned a lot about Mike.
[03:44.980 --> 03:45.980]  It was a really good time.
[03:45.980 --> 03:46.980]  I had a lot of fun.
[03:46.980 --> 03:47.980]  So check it out.
[03:47.980 --> 03:49.100]  Learn some stuff about my friend.
[03:51.100 --> 03:52.380]  All right, what else do we need to talk about?
[03:52.380 --> 03:53.780]  I am also in the process.
[03:53.780 --> 03:55.260]  I like to give you guys garden updates.
[03:55.260 --> 03:57.900]  I've got a quick garden update for you.
[03:57.900 --> 04:00.540]  I am in the process of reversing a male.
[04:00.540 --> 04:01.540]  No, excuse me.
[04:01.540 --> 04:02.540]  I messed that up.
[04:02.540 --> 04:03.540]  Let me say that correctly.
[04:03.540 --> 04:09.260]  I am in the process of reversing a female golden goat plant to create female pollen,
[04:09.260 --> 04:15.260]  which will only contain female chromosomes so I can make more feminized seeds from the
[04:15.260 --> 04:16.420]  golden goat cross.
[04:16.420 --> 04:19.780]  Yes, of course, I will be making more feminized golden goat.
[04:19.780 --> 04:21.420]  I'll make more lemon Jeffrey.
[04:21.420 --> 04:25.220]  There will be more orange chasm in there and there will be a couple of new things and a
[04:25.220 --> 04:29.820]  couple of things that have been made and were put out and were very sought after and I did
[04:29.820 --> 04:31.060]  not have enough to release it.
[04:31.060 --> 04:32.300]  I made testers.
[04:32.300 --> 04:36.840]  This time I'm going to make a production batch of a couple of very popular things.
[04:36.840 --> 04:40.340]  So we are using the golden goat reversed female to create the pollen.
[04:40.340 --> 04:44.140]  I also mentioned that I've got the lemon Jeffrey coming up, the orange chasm coming up and
[04:44.140 --> 04:46.420]  of course the feminized golden goat.
[04:46.420 --> 04:50.820]  To mix that mix, I'm going to add a strawberry fields plant so we can make more of the red
[04:50.820 --> 04:56.200]  pill and I will also add a blueberry cookies plant to make more of the blue pill.
[04:56.200 --> 04:59.300]  Both of those names were tentative stress test names.
[04:59.300 --> 05:00.660]  They will be changed.
[05:00.660 --> 05:04.140]  Those strains will not be marketed as the blue pill nor the red pill.
[05:04.140 --> 05:06.200]  They will have a different name when they come out.
[05:06.200 --> 05:07.200]  You guys will know it.
[05:07.200 --> 05:08.260]  I've got the names in my head.
[05:08.260 --> 05:09.260]  I have not announced them.
[05:09.260 --> 05:10.540]  I have not made anything official.
[05:10.540 --> 05:14.900]  I like to do a lot of research and make sure I didn't steal any names before I label a
[05:14.900 --> 05:15.900]  strain.
[05:16.380 --> 05:27.620]  So I'm working on reversing that goat.
[05:27.620 --> 05:29.540]  It has been sprayed its first time.
[05:29.540 --> 05:33.180]  I generally like to spray one time before I go to flower.
[05:33.180 --> 05:38.020]  Then I wait and put it into flower about seven to ten days after that.
[05:38.020 --> 05:40.220]  It gets sprayed the day which it goes into flower.
[05:40.220 --> 05:45.180]  Then it will get sprayed again every three days until I see pollen sacs forming.
[05:45.340 --> 05:47.340]  Depending on the strain, I may continue to spray.
[05:47.340 --> 05:48.340]  This is a golden goat.
[05:48.340 --> 05:51.900]  It needs continuous sprays after it shows pollen sacs.
[05:51.900 --> 05:56.580]  Then around day, most plants will show me pollen, give me pollen a little bit earlier.
[05:56.580 --> 05:58.100]  The golden goat is kind of stubborn.
[05:58.100 --> 06:01.300]  It makes me wait until about day 30, day 32.
[06:01.300 --> 06:03.220]  I will have pollen production.
[06:03.220 --> 06:05.760]  Shortly after that, I will have the females pollinated.
[06:05.760 --> 06:11.460]  I will put them in there when I see that the male plants are developing well on the golden
[06:11.460 --> 06:12.460]  goat.
[06:12.460 --> 06:13.460]  That's how I time that up.
[06:13.740 --> 06:15.900]  I see, oh, this female is now making balls.
[06:15.900 --> 06:16.980]  They're going to start opening.
[06:16.980 --> 06:18.940]  I see those real male plants forming.
[06:18.940 --> 06:20.420]  It's time to put the girls in there.
[06:20.420 --> 06:21.820]  That's the way that I time that.
[06:21.820 --> 06:26.020]  Don't put the girls in there until you know that reversal is actually reversing.
[06:26.020 --> 06:27.720]  Then that reversal will keep going.
[06:27.720 --> 06:29.140]  It's going to take a minute to turn.
[06:29.140 --> 06:30.140]  It's going to change sex.
[06:30.140 --> 06:31.500]  Then it's going to make pollen.
[06:31.500 --> 06:34.660]  Then by the time you get those females in there and get them flowering about 14 days
[06:34.660 --> 06:35.860]  in, everything will work out.
[06:35.860 --> 06:36.860]  It is beautiful.
[06:36.860 --> 06:38.820]  So it's all about timing, but that's where I am.
[06:38.820 --> 06:41.660]  I have begun the process of reversing the golden goat.
[06:41.660 --> 06:43.180]  It has received its first spray.
[06:43.180 --> 06:46.700]  It is not yet into the flower room, but it is getting ready.
[06:46.700 --> 06:48.020]  So that will get reversed.
[06:48.020 --> 06:50.180]  We'll pollinate some elite cuts.
[06:50.180 --> 06:51.700]  Like I said, we'll remake some things.
[06:51.700 --> 06:56.260]  And there are also a couple of things you guys don't even probably know I've got in
[06:56.260 --> 06:57.260]  there.
[06:57.260 --> 07:01.740]  So new stuff may be coming here in 2020 or 2021.
[07:01.740 --> 07:03.600]  We're already cranking through this year, you guys.
[07:03.600 --> 07:07.940]  It feels like this has been a long February or a real long fucking, I don't know, it's
[07:07.940 --> 07:11.460]  been a long Tuesday or something like that is what it's felt like.
[07:12.260 --> 07:15.540]  I hope you guys are going outside, getting some exercise, doing something.
[07:15.540 --> 07:17.420]  Take off your sweatpants and put on your jeans.
[07:17.420 --> 07:18.420]  Make sure they still fit.
[07:18.420 --> 07:21.140]  See how many belt holes you've extended your waist.
[07:21.140 --> 07:23.820]  Make sure you're doing all right with your health and with yourself.
[07:23.820 --> 07:24.820]  Check in on somebody.
[07:24.820 --> 07:27.580]  If you haven't called your mama, you haven't called somebody cool, call them, check in
[07:27.580 --> 07:28.580]  on them.
[07:28.580 --> 07:31.260]  It's not weird to call somebody and check on them during quarantine time.
[07:31.260 --> 07:32.260]  Take care of each other.
[07:32.260 --> 07:33.260]  Take care of ourselves.
[07:33.260 --> 07:34.260]  All right.
[07:34.260 --> 07:35.260]  That's enough quarantine talk.
[07:35.260 --> 07:37.020]  That's enough plant update talk.
[07:37.020 --> 07:38.340]  Oh, the LEDs, you guys.
[07:38.340 --> 07:40.300]  I talk about growing under LEDs.
[07:40.300 --> 07:42.980]  I continue to be impressed by the LEDs.
[07:42.980 --> 07:45.660]  The plants want to eat a little bit more, but I like that.
[07:45.660 --> 07:49.300]  That means I'm getting more growth, probably getting more production.
[07:49.300 --> 07:53.300]  The roots are probably expanding quite rapidly because I am feeding them more.
[07:53.300 --> 07:55.500]  I have recently started giving them dark.
[07:55.500 --> 07:58.860]  I give the seedlings and the brand new clones get 24 hours of light.
[07:58.860 --> 08:01.580]  I have recently given them, I've started giving them three hours.
[08:01.580 --> 08:04.940]  I'm going to give them four hours of darkness here on Monday.
[08:04.940 --> 08:07.900]  That will be, it's probably the day that this episode comes out.
[08:07.900 --> 08:12.460]  So they'll be clicked into four hours of darkness and 20 hours of light.
[08:12.460 --> 08:15.520]  They're going to be, some of the clones in that room will be flowered.
[08:15.520 --> 08:18.020]  Some of the clones in that room are intended to be mother plants.
[08:18.020 --> 08:21.980]  So once they get separated out of that room, the light cycle will get changed again.
[08:21.980 --> 08:24.860]  And then the plants will get arranged into their final spots.
[08:24.860 --> 08:26.700]  They'll get cloned.
[08:26.700 --> 08:29.460]  Then once we determine sex, then we will trellis them.
[08:29.460 --> 08:32.460]  And there's some steps to go, but I'm impressed with the LEDs.
[08:32.460 --> 08:33.460]  That's my point.
[08:33.460 --> 08:34.460]  I love the LEDs.
[08:34.460 --> 08:36.140]  I am seeing amazing growth.
[08:36.140 --> 08:40.260]  I don't think it's as hot as the 600 watt light that I replaced.
[08:40.260 --> 08:47.020]  I put the two 320 watt Canon LEDs in place of a 600, a 600 HPS.
[08:47.020 --> 08:49.060]  And it doesn't feel as warm in that room.
[08:49.060 --> 08:51.500]  Of course, we're not to the middle of the summer yet.
[08:51.500 --> 08:52.580]  That's when we will really know.
[08:52.580 --> 08:54.540]  I know how hot it got then.
[08:54.540 --> 08:55.620]  We'll compare then.
[08:55.620 --> 08:57.980]  But that is my rambling update on the grow room.
[08:57.980 --> 08:59.340]  We've got LEDs going.
[08:59.340 --> 09:00.400]  The plants in there look great.
[09:00.400 --> 09:02.060]  I've got Jack the Ripper seedlings.
[09:02.060 --> 09:03.380]  I don't know if I've revealed that before.
[09:03.380 --> 09:04.380]  I've talked to that.
[09:04.380 --> 09:05.380]  I've got seedlings in there.
[09:05.620 --> 09:06.620]  Jack the Ripper from Subcool.
[09:06.620 --> 09:07.620]  They're from TGA Genetics.
[09:07.620 --> 09:08.620]  They're Jack the Rippers.
[09:08.620 --> 09:09.620]  They look fairly uniform.
[09:09.620 --> 09:10.620]  There's one that grew.
[09:10.620 --> 09:11.620]  It looks like it topped itself.
[09:11.620 --> 09:12.620]  It grew two main tops.
[09:12.620 --> 09:13.620]  That one's interesting.
[09:13.620 --> 09:14.620]  But the other four, they all look fairly similar.
[09:14.620 --> 09:15.620]  If I were to pull off that extra side branch that makes it have two tops, that other one
[09:15.620 --> 09:16.620]  would match the others very well.
[09:16.620 --> 09:17.620]  So quite uniform except for that one weirdo.
[09:17.620 --> 09:18.620]  That's kind of what you expect.
[09:18.620 --> 09:19.620]  They're Jack the Rippers.
[09:19.620 --> 09:20.620]  They fucking love, love, love the LEDs.
[09:20.620 --> 09:21.620]  They're in three gallon pots.
[09:21.620 --> 09:22.620]  Soil is in three gallon pots.
[09:22.620 --> 09:23.620]  Soil is in three gallon pots.
[09:23.620 --> 09:24.620]  Soil is in three gallon pots.
[09:24.620 --> 09:25.620]  Soil is in three gallon pots.
[09:25.620 --> 09:26.620]  Soil is in three gallon pots.
[09:27.620 --> 09:42.400]  That's what I got for you on that.
[09:42.400 --> 09:43.400]  Okay.
[09:43.400 --> 09:45.100]  I did say we're going to read some emails.
[09:45.100 --> 09:46.920]  I've got two emails lined up.
[09:46.920 --> 09:50.520]  We may pull out a third depending on how long this episode goes, depending on how rambley
[09:50.520 --> 09:52.160]  I continue to be
[09:52.160 --> 09:58.420]  The first email in this episode comes from our friend popper Roni and it goes like this. It says hey Rasta Jeff
[09:58.420 --> 10:01.940]  I've been listening to your podcast for a few months and I love it. Thank you, bro
[10:01.940 --> 10:05.420]  I love hearing comments and compliments like that and thank you for listening
[10:05.420 --> 10:09.920]  I say this all the time, but it's really true if you guys weren't listening if it were just me talking
[10:09.920 --> 10:14.180]  This would be a problem. This would be fucking weird. So you guys make this a thing
[10:14.180 --> 10:18.560]  I would just be a psychopath or something if I just sat here and spoke into the mic and stared at myself like this
[10:18.560 --> 10:22.120]  Hey Jeff, they just be fucking really weird. So I'm glad I've got a good audience
[10:22.120 --> 10:26.640]  I'm glad you guys are so supportive and I have been really loving and enjoying the
[10:26.860 --> 10:32.560]  Interaction that I've been getting through social media through email just during this quarantine. We've all been keeping each other company
[10:32.560 --> 10:34.480]  So, thank you. I do appreciate that
[10:34.480 --> 10:40.860]  So this says I am way overdue for finally becoming a patreon country patron says patreon, but it means patron
[10:40.860 --> 10:46.660]  I was gonna say patreon contributor, but it just says from becoming a patreon, but I am here finally
[10:46.940 --> 10:49.840]  Man don't worry about taking a long time to join us on patreon
[10:49.840 --> 10:55.060]  It takes a minute. Some people don't know it exists and you've got to put in a credit card number on the internet
[10:55.060 --> 11:00.660]  That's sketchy. I understand and dude not everybody's got a few bucks and I'm not I don't expect money from everybody
[11:00.660 --> 11:03.820]  If you can you can and you can now so thank you. I do appreciate that
[11:03.820 --> 11:09.300]  I don't want anybody to feel bad for not helping me out on patreon plenty of people do so
[11:09.300 --> 11:11.460]  Thank you to the people who do and if you don't keep listening
[11:11.700 --> 11:15.140]  The way that you can help me out is tell a friend how cool the show is or
[11:15.420 --> 11:20.440]  Just do your best in the grow every single day when you're in the grow think what would Rasta Jeff do?
[11:20.460 --> 11:25.260]  That's what that's the rules. You should follow in there do the Rasta Jeff method any shit that can be done today
[11:25.300 --> 11:29.060]  Do it today. Don't wait till tomorrow anything you can do a little bit better
[11:29.060 --> 11:32.180]  Do it a little bit better anything you can clean up fucking clean it up
[11:32.340 --> 11:38.720]  Be the best cannabis grower and cannabis advocate and spokesperson you can be don't be a dipshit in public when you're lit
[11:38.720 --> 11:40.720]  That's the way you can help me out for free
[11:41.500 --> 11:46.780]  You guys I told you I'm rambly let's blame it on our friends at green dot labs for the banana orange cookies
[11:46.780 --> 11:48.580]  that shit is delicious and
[11:48.580 --> 11:50.300]  Potent. Alright, there is more to this
[11:50.300 --> 11:54.020]  It says for now, you can refer to me as Papa Rony on the podcast
[11:54.020 --> 11:59.840]  It rhymes with pepperoni just begins with a Papa don't ask an old friend came up with it, bro. Don't worry
[11:59.840 --> 12:05.140]  I'm never gonna ask why we call one of my friends Papa Rony, but big shout out to my friend Papa Rony
[12:05.140 --> 12:09.700]  I've seen your name pop up in the patreon contribution feed several times. I do appreciate you
[12:09.700 --> 12:11.920]  Thank you for helping us out on patreon
[12:11.920 --> 12:15.980]  Then it says I'm looking forward to talking with you as soon as I upgrade my patreon tier
[12:15.980 --> 12:19.340]  I'm sure you'll be able to pass on a lot of grow wisdom
[12:19.380 --> 12:25.500]  Thanks a million for all you do signed again from Papa Rony. Hey, bro. Don't be afraid to ask me some questions
[12:25.500 --> 12:30.380]  You've signed up for patreon. You were part of the squad. You're part of the gang. Send me an email if you've got questions
[12:30.380 --> 12:33.780]  We'll get them going anybody else out there. If you've got questions, let me know
[12:33.780 --> 12:36.340]  My email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[12:36.860 --> 12:42.220]  Of course I do get to those patreon questions a little bit more frequently and sooner
[12:42.220 --> 12:47.560]  So the patreon may be a way to get your question moved up to the top of the ladder or have a really good question
[12:47.560 --> 12:52.140]  If your question is interesting, I will read it on the show. I try to help everybody out. I've got a stack over here
[12:52.140 --> 12:56.140]  I was probably a hundred emails in there. I'm gonna read them all it just may take a long time
[12:57.140 --> 12:59.980]  Let's refocus and put me back on the rails here you guys
[12:59.980 --> 13:03.620]  I'm going way fast today and I got a lot of shit to say this one comes from
[13:03.740 --> 13:08.420]  I don't know if they want their name said but this one comes from a friend down there in Albuquerque
[13:08.420 --> 13:12.260]  Shout out to my friends in the 505 Albuquerque in the house. I hope you're doing well
[13:12.340 --> 13:18.700]  Hope you guys aren't going to Albuquerque during the quarantine, but the message goes a little bit like this
[13:18.700 --> 13:22.180]  It says good morning, my friend. Good morning to you as well. I hope you're listening in the morning
[13:22.180 --> 13:26.420]  It says I write you with a curious problem about some product. I was given
[13:26.420 --> 13:31.780]  I recently flowered five blue og kush a reggie allegedly from we're not gonna say who they came from
[13:32.300 --> 13:34.300]  Allegedly from this place in California
[13:34.620 --> 13:38.340]  My friend had many other seeds and strains from various other breeders
[13:38.340 --> 13:44.540]  My friend happened upon the stash of flower and seeds after the feds broke up the grow in, California
[13:44.820 --> 13:50.100]  So you found some flowers and seeds from a rated grow in, California
[13:50.100 --> 13:55.500]  These plants were left unattended and eventually seeded. Yes that if so, were they just let's see
[13:55.500 --> 13:59.740]  I want to read more on a read that again friend other seeds and strains what happened to the stash of flower?
[13:59.740 --> 14:03.180]  And the feds broke up the grow so there was stuff that was left unattended
[14:03.940 --> 14:05.940]  There were a number of strains in the room
[14:06.060 --> 14:11.140]  That seeded up my question to you is a number of these female plants hermed out to create
[14:11.140 --> 14:15.100]  Oh if a number of these plants hermed out to create seed throughout the whole greenhouse
[14:15.180 --> 14:19.460]  There were thousands of viable seeds and they were labeled accordingly to the plant
[14:19.460 --> 14:25.980]  They came out of blue genetics and allegedly tout stability, but all phenos were wildly vastly different
[14:25.980 --> 14:33.260]  My question is are these seeds blue og back cross or when they herm is the pollen get bad enough
[14:33.460 --> 14:39.940]  That I have a bunch of crazy random crosses that now need to be stabilized. Okay, that's a really good question. I
[14:40.940 --> 14:43.900]  Took your advice and I'm waiting around or two to start breeding
[14:43.900 --> 14:47.420]  I'm keeping some amazing fruity gas and purple phenos alive
[14:47.580 --> 14:53.120]  Until I can afford a small tent to either stress the female for more BX seeds or to pop a male
[14:53.120 --> 14:59.360]  So I can collect pollen any advice or expert knowledge would be appreciated. I don't want to tell people this is og cush
[14:59.560 --> 15:06.840]  if it was really crossed with candy land or some clementine or Lucinda Williams and I still want to stabilize this strain in the future and
[15:06.920 --> 15:13.120]  Possibly start breeding once since no one wants to take initiative in Albuquerque to breed
[15:13.480 --> 15:18.040]  Bro, there are a couple of people doing really wonderful breeding projects down there in Albuquerque
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.400]  If you do a little bit of research, you can find them on social media very easily
[15:21.680 --> 15:27.480]  Shout out to my friends down there doing breeding projects in Albuquerque. I go down there and do some consulting for some other crows
[15:27.480 --> 15:29.920]  I'm not involved in any of the breeding projects down there
[15:29.920 --> 15:35.760]  But I do know what's going on going on down there in the cannabis scene and Albuquerque very interesting stuff happening right now
[15:35.760 --> 15:38.620]  Especially with the quarantine. They're gonna run out of herb if they don't step it up
[15:39.200 --> 15:45.320]  But there are breeders in Albuquerque. So but still don't be afraid to do it. This is a really interesting question
[15:45.320 --> 15:49.760]  Um, you said you're gonna try to find a male out of here. You won't find a true male
[15:49.760 --> 15:54.720]  I don't think if this was a grow a commercial cultivation that was raided and taken down
[15:55.520 --> 16:01.280]  I'm going to assume and this is just me making an ass of you and me that all of the plants in this cultivation were
[16:01.280 --> 16:05.520]  Females, they probably did not want males around in a commercial cultivation
[16:05.520 --> 16:09.940]  They're trying to make money if they got raided they're going after money. They probably weren't breeding
[16:09.940 --> 16:14.880]  It was probably a big setup on so you got a bunch of plants that seeded out. They were all females
[16:15.360 --> 16:19.720]  They seeded so there are a couple of ways that this could have happened
[16:19.720 --> 16:23.120]  They probably they I'm gonna guess they hermed out or they did a thing
[16:23.680 --> 16:30.080]  Where when the plants go too long, they make seeds and I'm not sure if those seeds are going to produce
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.620]  hermaphroditic seeds or if those seeds are going are a hermaphroditic progeny
[16:34.840 --> 16:39.700]  With intersex traits or if they're going to produce feminized seeds. You said you're looking for a male
[16:39.700 --> 16:43.480]  I don't know that that's gonna come up if they came from female plants
[16:43.480 --> 16:46.840]  There will be no male genetics in that gene pool
[16:46.840 --> 16:51.720]  So you should not find any males if you find a male plant it is actually a hermaphrodite
[16:51.720 --> 16:58.920]  It is going to express male parts, but also it will have female parts, but there was no male pollen in this room
[16:59.400 --> 17:01.400]  hopefully allegedly
[17:01.440 --> 17:03.820]  I'm assuming so so
[17:04.320 --> 17:06.320]  You've got a couple of good questions in here
[17:06.360 --> 17:12.720]  Are these blue og back cross or when they herm does the pollen get bad enough that you have a bunch of crazy random crosses?
[17:12.760 --> 17:19.280]  We don't know where the pollen came from. We don't know if that one of the plants freaked out and hermed and made pollen
[17:19.280 --> 17:22.260]  We don't know if two different strains in that room freaked out made pollen
[17:22.260 --> 17:25.760]  we don't know if every room or every plant in that room turned into a
[17:26.080 --> 17:32.680]  Hermaphrodite and made pollen and pollinated that room the pollen from plant a and B could have landed on plant C
[17:32.680 --> 17:39.560]  So now you've got seeds that are a B and C. So it's really hard to identify exactly what you've got out of that room
[17:40.480 --> 17:45.100]  Then a bunch of crazy random crosses. Yes, you've got a bunch of crazy random crosses
[17:45.480 --> 17:49.680]  If there is something in there that you find what you can do is grow them yourself
[17:49.680 --> 17:54.560]  You're if this is a personal breeding project, you can grow them yourself. Don't don't let me slow you down
[17:54.960 --> 17:58.800]  Don't put these to market. These are not for anybody else. These are for you
[17:58.840 --> 18:04.280]  This story is a cool story for you to tell behind some seeds, but these seeds aren't for anybody else
[18:04.320 --> 18:10.480]  They're going to be mutants hermaphrodites and question marks coming out of these seeds you don't know what's there
[18:10.480 --> 18:14.080]  You can't ask for money for seeds with question marks
[18:14.080 --> 18:19.040]  You've got to have you got to know parents of parents of parents and how they were bred and where they were bred if you're
[18:19.040 --> 18:20.760]  Gonna ask for money for seeds
[18:20.760 --> 18:22.760]  That's just like throwing
[18:22.760 --> 18:27.460]  Just like saying hey make me some food and we'll open a food truck and I just go to the fridge and I get seven
[18:27.460 --> 18:29.740]  Random ingredients and put them in a blender and I go there you go
[18:30.540 --> 18:34.840]  You hope I got ice cream and peanut butter and not like pickles and peanut butter and you know
[18:34.840 --> 18:39.020]  So you got to know what's going into there? And so I'm rambling cuz I'm high as shit now
[18:39.020 --> 18:43.460]  We're talking about ice cream. But geez, let me get back on track. You don't know what made those crosses and
[18:44.740 --> 18:49.100]  If it hermed out then you've got her genetics. Also, you're gonna carry on that herm trait
[18:49.100 --> 18:54.040]  So if you grow them out see what you've got and you said you're gonna find a male in there
[18:54.040 --> 18:57.840]  There's not gonna be a true male. You're gonna have and don't stress the female for more BX
[18:58.160 --> 18:59.840]  You're going to make
[18:59.840 --> 19:07.160]  hermaphrodites by doing all of this stress find something that is a solid female that has the traits you like if you really insist on
[19:07.160 --> 19:14.300]  Working with these to further generations find a female that expresses full female traits that has all the other traits you like aroma
[19:14.820 --> 19:16.800]  potency color structure
[19:16.800 --> 19:20.380]  Whatever you're looking for find that in one of those plants from seed
[19:20.680 --> 19:24.980]  Then stress test the shit out of it put it in many different environments
[19:24.980 --> 19:28.600]  See if it hermaphrodites on you in there then here's another trick
[19:28.600 --> 19:30.800]  This is what I do with the plant before I breed with it
[19:30.800 --> 19:34.300]  Give it a stress test put it on 1212 for about three weeks
[19:34.300 --> 19:36.980]  Once you see bud sets forming you got nice fat pistols
[19:36.980 --> 19:42.720]  You got dandelions going up the branches fuck with the timer put it back on 18-6 run it for about two weeks
[19:42.720 --> 19:46.160]  See what it does. Does it freak out immediately? Does it act? Okay
[19:46.160 --> 19:51.100]  Does it not freak out at all then put that timer back on 1212 and give it give it 10 days
[19:51.100 --> 19:56.640]  See what it does now, you're what two four or five weeks in maybe six weeks in let's fuck with it again
[19:56.640 --> 19:59.240]  Let's put the timer on 24 hours for two days
[19:59.440 --> 20:04.640]  Let's just see what happens. This plant may produce seeds if it produces seeds on its own, that's okay
[20:04.640 --> 20:08.600]  But if it produces hermaphrodite signs if it shows you male flowers popping up
[20:08.600 --> 20:11.280]  We've got to get rid of that plant or do not breed with it
[20:11.280 --> 20:15.520]  You've got to breed with one that will not hermaphrodite on you
[20:15.520 --> 20:22.020]  You need to get very very careful to not have hermaphroditic intersex traits in your breeding project
[20:22.020 --> 20:25.980]  So identify a solid female because you only want a female out of this batch
[20:26.740 --> 20:31.060]  Then what I would do personally I would whip up a batch of silver thiosulfate
[20:31.060 --> 20:37.880]  and I would reverse that female and make pollen out of that female and put that pollen on a clone of the same plant and
[20:37.880 --> 20:44.740]  Make reversed seeds out of that then grow those if you did a good job by selecting one that is not hermaphroditic
[20:44.740 --> 20:48.940]  Which it's going to be scarce in this batch because that is a trait that is in there these plants
[20:49.020 --> 20:55.180]  Reproduced without a male in the room. There's a sexual reproduction that happened. There had to be pollen production somehow
[20:55.180 --> 21:00.740]  I don't know. I can't identify what did it? I wasn't there, but we've got a sexual reproduction in this room
[21:00.740 --> 21:06.820]  So hermaphroditism or intersex traits is very common or very likely some more in this gene pool
[21:06.820 --> 21:13.580]  So find a solid female find the female that is what you want stress test the shit out of her reverse her by using silver
[21:13.780 --> 21:19.500]  Thiosulfate don't do it with light. Don't do it with heat. Don't do with any of that silver silly shit use silver thiosulfate
[21:19.940 --> 21:23.940]  Reverse it instead of causing a hermaphrodite. Let's cause a chemical reaction in the plant
[21:23.940 --> 21:28.000]  This is a little bit different people are gonna say I'm crazy, but we're doing it chemically. It's controlled
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.940]  I know what I'm doing it with it. This isn't a trait that's just in there
[21:30.940 --> 21:34.500]  I'm using some science behind my understandings of doing this to the plant
[21:34.500 --> 21:39.120]  So then reverse it then pollinate a clone of the same plant now, you've made s1
[21:39.120 --> 21:45.080]  You've got self seeds grow those you'll find many phenotypes that look just like the mother plant
[21:45.080 --> 21:50.760]  You just reverse and then you'll find some phenotypes that lean a little bit towards whatever the pollen came from
[21:50.760 --> 21:55.040]  I don't know and you'll have more that lean a little bit towards whatever the pollen receiver was
[21:55.240 --> 21:59.960]  It sounds like you could have Lucinda Williams crosses. You could have candy land. You could have Clementine
[22:00.200 --> 22:04.660]  You could have blue OG you can have all kinds of random crosses in this room
[22:04.660 --> 22:08.560]  But I don't know what seeds you're working with because I don't know which planet came from
[22:09.120 --> 22:12.540]  Why I feel like I really went on a good ramble on that. I think I covered it though
[22:12.540 --> 22:16.480]  You've got random pollen in a room. I don't know which plants the pollen came from
[22:16.480 --> 22:20.960]  I don't know what caused the pollen you've got a lot of variables. Don't try to make money off this batch of seeds
[22:20.960 --> 22:24.080]  You did say that you're waiting before you start doing some breeding
[22:24.560 --> 22:29.000]  Advice and expert knowledge and don't take money for these because you'll make people mad. It will ruin your reputation
[22:29.920 --> 22:32.000]  And then don't share them if you do share them
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.280]  Make sure you only share them with people, you know that you can tell them this story
[22:36.280 --> 22:38.900]  All right. I want to thank you for the great email. This was a good one
