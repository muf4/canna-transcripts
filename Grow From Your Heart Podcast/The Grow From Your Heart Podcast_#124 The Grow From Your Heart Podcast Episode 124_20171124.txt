[00:17.660 --> 00:21.860]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 124 of the
[00:21.860 --> 00:25.660]  Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:25.660 --> 00:29.220]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:29.220 --> 00:32.500]  grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:32.500 --> 00:35.180]  activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of
[00:35.180 --> 00:40.740]  cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends call me
[00:40.740 --> 00:43.980]  Ross the Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I need to
[00:43.980 --> 00:46.740]  send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band for
[00:46.740 --> 00:51.100]  letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
[00:51.100 --> 00:56.540]  Mystic Roots crew. Damn, thank you for joining me you guys. Sitting at the table
[00:56.540 --> 00:58.940]  this week, I got our good buddy White Mike is back. Thanks for joining me dude.
[00:58.940 --> 01:03.100]  What's up everybody? And also in front of me, the lovely, the traveling stoner, also
[01:03.100 --> 01:07.140]  known as Lindsey. Thank you for joining me. Thank you for having me. You guys, we
[01:07.140 --> 01:10.780]  were choking, we were coughing, we've had a bunch of dabs. We're getting a Hitman E-Series
[01:10.780 --> 01:14.060]  sidecar rig with a bunch of Turpex, Triangle Killer, and a Black Cherry Chem
[01:14.060 --> 01:17.900]  Hash. What are the Black Cherries tasting? My throat's gonna sound like shit for a
[01:17.900 --> 01:20.940]  couple of minutes here, but you guys will have to bear with me. It's gonna be alright
[01:20.940 --> 01:25.020]  because this is gonna be a very fun episode in my opinion. Our friend Lindsey,
[01:25.020 --> 01:28.260]  the traveling stoner, she's been on the show a couple of times here. A couple of
[01:28.260 --> 01:32.660]  rowdy episodes with a bunch of boys. She sent me a text message with a whole
[01:32.660 --> 01:38.420]  bunch of questions about politics and the upcoming elections and things, and I
[01:38.420 --> 01:41.900]  thought the best thing we could do is get White Mike over here. White Mike is
[01:41.900 --> 01:46.060]  kind of my political expert. That would be me. If I have a politics question, Mike is the guy
[01:46.060 --> 01:50.700]  that I call. Everybody needs one of us. Yeah, yeah. I made a new politics
[01:50.700 --> 01:54.580]  friend also in Springs. I met the guy that does your job in Springs, so shout
[01:54.580 --> 01:57.140]  out to Matt. It was good meeting you the other day at the Canny Canyon. Thanks for
[01:57.140 --> 02:00.380]  being on the podcast. Yeah, nice job, Matt. I enjoyed you on the show. Dude, if you two
[02:00.380 --> 02:05.500]  got in the room together, the cannabis opposition would be in some deep shit.
[02:05.500 --> 02:09.220]  I'm dying to get to the Canny Canyon after that episode. Yeah, shout out to the
[02:09.340 --> 02:12.180]  Canny Canyon, you guys. If you haven't been there, go check it out. It's at 1507
[02:12.180 --> 02:15.620]  Colorado Boulevard in Colorado Springs. Make sure you tell the lovely Camille
[02:15.620 --> 02:18.740]  that Rasta Jeff sent you to the Canny Canyon. I love the Canny Canyon. It's my
[02:18.740 --> 02:23.820]  literal favorite place to go in Colorado Springs. My grow is my home away
[02:23.820 --> 02:27.380]  from home, but then when I have to go away from one of those two, I go to the
[02:27.380 --> 02:32.500]  Canny Canyon and terp out. When you do it right, it's easy to support. Right, and
[02:32.500 --> 02:37.460]  they do it right at the Canny Canyon. The place is classy as fuck.
[02:38.020 --> 02:42.100]  Total unintended shout out. I like it. All right, so we're talking about this
[02:42.100 --> 02:46.220]  email that the Traveling Stoner sent. We got Mike here. I thought that it would
[02:46.220 --> 02:50.380]  be fun if I kind of handed the... I'm not going to let you be the host. We'll let
[02:50.380 --> 02:53.820]  you be the co-host today. You can be the unofficial co-host. We'll pass you over
[02:53.820 --> 02:56.060]  that. You want me to move the mic for you? Yeah, can I like... I don't even know
[02:56.060 --> 02:59.580]  how to... Just loosen it up right here. Shit, I can't even do it. That's why I was
[02:59.580 --> 03:02.700]  like, what the hell? No, you just got to leave it where it is. How do you want it?
[03:02.980 --> 03:06.820]  I was going to do a little lower. Here, we'll play this part right here. That
[03:07.580 --> 03:10.740]  works? That works. We're fixing microphones live on the show, guys. Don't
[03:10.740 --> 03:14.420]  worry. You'll get to hear some mic movement and shit. There we go. Just grab
[03:14.420 --> 03:17.140]  it and move it. It'll move now. Okay, cool. Get it where you want it. There you
[03:17.140 --> 03:20.620]  go. Is it even... No, you're good. You're good. Okay, cool. Until you play with the
[03:20.620 --> 03:25.340]  cord. Oh, there we go. I couldn't hear myself. Okay, cool. Jesus. I'm not going
[03:25.340 --> 03:27.500]  to edit that out. That's how shit goes in our world. You guys, I hope you
[03:27.500 --> 03:32.180]  enjoyed it. Welcome to the backstage view there. Every show comes with a few
[03:32.180 --> 03:36.900]  technical difficulties. Yeah. Now my headphones aren't working. We were
[03:36.900 --> 03:39.380]  talking about this earlier. There is the... I'm going to wiggle this and see
[03:39.380 --> 03:42.020]  if it cuts in. Is it coming? Is it coming? No, now you're screwing with mine
[03:42.020 --> 03:45.260]  too. Yeah, right. So there's a piece that I bought at Guitar Center. It's the
[03:45.300 --> 03:53.020]  Livewire Advantage HA04 4-channel stereo headphone amp. Fuck that thing. Don't
[03:53.020 --> 03:55.780]  buy one of those. If you've got one, get it replaced because it's going to crap
[03:55.780 --> 03:58.140]  out on you and cause you problems. It almost blew Mike's head up the other
[03:58.180 --> 04:01.820]  couple of minutes ago. Yeah, my ears are still ringing a little bit from that
[04:01.820 --> 04:05.380]  volume spike. That was fun. I apologize. I do apologize. It wasn't you, it was
[04:05.380 --> 04:07.940]  the gear, buddy. As long as you know that. I wasn't doing it on purpose. I
[04:07.940 --> 04:11.060]  need your ears for this show. Don't buy the piece he said. Yes, don't buy that
[04:11.060 --> 04:15.860]  thing. It sucks. I give it a thumbs down. Five rotten leaves. All right, so we're
[04:15.860 --> 04:19.700]  going to get to some of these questions that Lindsay typed very professionally
[04:19.700 --> 04:23.900]  and sent to me in a very nice PDF. This is marvelous. So very good questions.
[04:23.900 --> 04:27.020]  They've been scratched down in a notebook for two weeks, so I'm glad they look
[04:27.020 --> 04:29.620]  marvelous to you. They look good and tight and you got a nice little
[04:29.620 --> 04:33.500]  PowerPoint thing going on here. All right, so I'm going to let you go ahead
[04:33.620 --> 04:37.060]  and this is my friend, Lindsay, also known as the Traveling Stoner. Make sure
[04:37.060 --> 04:42.140]  you follow her on Instagram. She does a periscope. She's a great chick. You'd
[04:42.140 --> 04:45.780]  like to watch her. I'm sure she's fun. She's got tattoos and takes fat dabs.
[04:45.780 --> 04:48.300]  There's nothing wrong with that. So I'm going to kind of, I'm going to kind of
[04:48.300 --> 04:51.300]  sit back and take a couple of dreadlocks. Now you can't forget to say that she's
[04:51.300 --> 04:54.420]  got some dreadlocks now too. So she's team dreadlocks. Shout out to Chris for
[04:54.420 --> 04:57.020]  putting in the dreadlocks for us. Shout out to Chris. Mike looks a little
[04:57.020 --> 05:00.460]  offended. No, I'm just wondering if you can be on the team this early. Yeah.
[05:00.460 --> 05:03.180]  Hell yeah. Well, yeah, she's those are dreadlocks. It's official. They're in.
[05:03.220 --> 05:06.140]  She was actually, you're right. Okay. The only reason you're right is because
[05:06.540 --> 05:10.140]  see, I wouldn't know. I've had long hair before, but I never went dread. Well,
[05:10.140 --> 05:13.780]  since she's had to deal with some social stigma already, she's been harassed by
[05:13.780 --> 05:18.300]  somebody. Yeah, it's official. That's I think, I think that's when you got your
[05:18.300 --> 05:23.500]  hat. Not when they went in. I, uh, I only ask is I watched what happened when a
[05:23.540 --> 05:29.180]  dude got the dreadlocks warm for like two festivals and then cut them out. Um,
[05:29.180 --> 05:34.500]  I watched the community revolt around them. Uh, just throw back to, I don't
[05:34.500 --> 05:37.020]  know where that came from. That was happened years ago in college, but yeah,
[05:37.020 --> 05:41.260]  I just seemed like a good question to hit you with. Mike's comfortable on the
[05:41.260 --> 05:44.540]  show now. Yeah, he is nice. We said he was comfortable on the mic. He's like,
[05:44.540 --> 05:47.860]  I'll say anything now. Right? Like I'm at, yeah, there's something about this
[05:47.860 --> 05:51.860]  table and possibly something about dabs. It's both. It's both. This is the dad
[05:52.660 --> 05:58.020]  yes. Yeah. I've already gotten some serious, I've already gotten some serious
[05:58.020 --> 06:01.740]  negativity about them. Uh, some serious hate. So I'm already going to call
[06:01.740 --> 06:06.340]  myself team dreadlock. It's official. Yep. I'm doing it. She's got a nice
[06:06.340 --> 06:11.500]  little starter kit. You guys. All right. So I'm going to kind of hand you the
[06:11.500 --> 06:15.500]  hosting situation here. Let you, uh, ask Mike some questions. Uh, I will
[06:15.500 --> 06:18.700]  definitely interject and drive the show, but I'm going to sit back and take some
[06:18.700 --> 06:22.540]  dabs of some triangle killer from Turpex while you guys chat. So listeners,
[06:22.740 --> 06:25.580]  uh, let her know how she does. Send her some tweets, send her something on
[06:25.580 --> 06:28.860]  Instagram or on Snapchat, or make sure you follow her on Periscope and let her
[06:28.860 --> 06:32.860]  know what you thought of her performance here on the podcast. All right, it's all
[06:32.860 --> 06:37.100]  yours. Young lady, have fun. Cool. Um, so this idea for this podcast actually
[06:37.100 --> 06:41.260]  came, um, from a trip coming over to Colorado, uh, while I was moving here in
[06:41.260 --> 06:45.460]  December, I, uh, spent most of the trip listening to the, uh, grow from your
[06:45.620 --> 06:51.380]  podcast. And I, um, thank you. And tell us where you came from. Uh, Florida. So
[06:51.380 --> 06:55.100]  you go from Florida to Colorado and listen to the podcast. Yeah. We actually
[06:55.100 --> 06:58.140]  went up to North Carolina first and then came over to, so like we had an extra
[06:58.140 --> 07:01.700]  long trip cause it was Christmas. So we went to go see my family in North
[07:01.700 --> 07:04.940]  Carolina and then came over. So like, I mean, it was a nice break for a couple
[07:04.940 --> 07:08.140]  of days, but yeah, we definitely got a lot of podcasts listening in. That's a
[07:08.140 --> 07:12.260]  lot of podcasts. A lot of stats moving for me. Thank you. I think that's why
[07:12.300 --> 07:14.780]  Scooby liked you so much. He's like, I've heard this guy's voice already.
[07:14.780 --> 07:21.300]  Like shout out to Scooby the dog. That dog is the coolest. Oh yeah, he really
[07:21.300 --> 07:25.540]  is. Um, but yeah, so, uh, uh, Chris and I were Bobo blaster co and I were
[07:25.540 --> 07:29.380]  discussing about it the whole time that, um, you guys really needed to do a show
[07:29.380 --> 07:33.980]  about the upcoming election and, um, that pro marijuana people need to know
[07:33.980 --> 07:38.340]  which candidate to vote for and which one will actually help marijuana laws
[07:38.340 --> 07:41.420]  get put in place instead of helping us or, you know, making us take steps
[07:41.420 --> 07:46.420]  backwards. So, yeah, so a lot of my questions here about the upcoming
[07:46.420 --> 07:50.740]  election. So I guess my question to you, Mike, is, um, what states look like
[07:50.740 --> 07:55.540]  they'll be legalizing marijuana in the upcoming election? Okay, it's a little
[07:55.540 --> 08:01.220]  too early to tell what the votes gonna look like come November, but we already
[08:01.220 --> 08:05.820]  know that a number of states are going to be voting on legalization. Um, or
[08:05.820 --> 08:09.260]  we've got a good list of states where there are major groups that look like
[08:09.260 --> 08:13.540]  they've got a shot of getting it on the ballot and, uh, in November or were
[08:13.540 --> 08:16.260]  states where there's a legislative effort to get it on the ballot in
[08:16.260 --> 08:21.380]  November. Um, in those states or Arizona, California, Florida, Maine,
[08:21.380 --> 08:27.020]  Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Rhode Island and Vermont, um,
[08:27.020 --> 08:31.340]  may all be voting on recreational marijuana this November. Okay. Um,
[08:31.340 --> 08:36.380]  states voting on just medical, uh, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North
[08:36.380 --> 08:41.820]  Carolina and Ohio. Um, that's a shitload of states voting this
[08:41.820 --> 08:46.420]  November. Um, other states could make the list. There's still plenty of time
[08:46.420 --> 08:50.900]  in most states for either a ballot initiative or for people to lobby their
[08:50.900 --> 08:56.180]  legislatures enough to get the vote on the ballot in November this year. Wow.
[08:56.460 --> 08:59.180]  That is a lot of states. Actually, I wasn't expecting you to say that many.
[08:59.180 --> 09:02.500]  Right. That's why I had to make notes for the first time ever. When I got
[09:02.500 --> 09:07.260]  emailed this list of questions Jeff was talking about a minute ago, um, that
[09:07.260 --> 09:10.500]  nerdy part of my brain got really excited and I was like, this is the show
[09:10.500 --> 09:13.420]  I've been wanting to do. And somebody did the line notes for me. You had a
[09:13.420 --> 09:17.820]  nice long list of states there. I've got to fuck over because he had medical on
[09:17.820 --> 09:22.500]  one side and wreck on the other two page or a front and a backside because, um,
[09:22.500 --> 09:26.700]  I, I've got notes on each state's effort to, I just don't know how in depth you
[09:26.700 --> 09:30.780]  want to go with this answer. I mean, you can really give it to me. That's fine
[09:30.780 --> 09:34.820]  because I mean, you know, the articles that I want to write, I wanted to do one
[09:34.820 --> 09:38.140]  on each state. So if you want to go through the, like just a brief thing on
[09:38.140 --> 09:39.460]  each state, that's totally cool.
[09:40.260 --> 09:42.780]  I tried to avoid the subject, but you just said something that I've got to
[09:42.780 --> 09:48.180]  address. I'm going to bust you out here. She said, write articles, uh, let our
[09:48.180 --> 09:51.100]  listeners know where those articles are going to appear and who you represent.
[09:51.380 --> 09:56.540]  Yeah. So shout out to miss Mary Jane co because I am the new intern blog writer
[09:56.580 --> 10:01.980]  for them. Um, and I have been helping them get their blog up and running and,
[10:02.060 --> 10:05.740]  um, in production. Um, I've been writing the articles and stuff for them. So
[10:06.020 --> 10:10.380]  shout out to miss Mary Jane co and Madison and Dan. Um, uh, you know, so that
[10:10.380 --> 10:12.900]  that's where the articles will be, uh, eventually.
[10:12.980 --> 10:14.740]  And you're an intern. Yeah. So you don't get paid.
[10:15.940 --> 10:16.660]  Oh, that's what I know.
[10:18.100 --> 10:21.020]  That's why I'm doing that. You're right on for, for doing that. It'll work on a
[10:21.020 --> 10:23.820]  nice resume. Absolutely. Thanks for supporting the community for free.
[10:24.660 --> 10:27.220]  Yeah. So we all got to do our part, you guys. All right. I'll step back and
[10:28.780 --> 10:33.420]  we were at which states are voting on legalization. And I was just about to run
[10:33.420 --> 10:37.300]  through a brief little note on each or at least the little note that I made looking
[10:37.300 --> 10:46.420]  these up this afternoon. Um, this list came out in December or January. Um, and
[10:46.460 --> 10:49.780]  already it's only March, but there's already been time for another state to
[10:49.780 --> 10:55.540]  make this list. And I think possibly for one to drop off of it. Um, but, uh,
[10:56.100 --> 10:59.980]  back when this was, uh, this official list that I kind of snatched was, uh,
[11:00.020 --> 11:05.020]  published, um, Arizona folks, there's a group collecting signatures. They need
[11:05.020 --> 11:12.780]  150,000 signatures by July 7th, uh, to make the 2016 vote in November. Um, the
[11:12.820 --> 11:17.860]  initiative includes home grow. So, um, from what I could gather, they're going
[11:17.900 --> 11:22.140]  to have a Colorado style system that includes home grow. Um, not all of the
[11:22.140 --> 11:26.980]  states that are looking to vote on legalization have home grow. Each state
[11:26.980 --> 11:30.900]  has its own initiative. It's an issue. It's initiative comes with its own rules.
[11:31.420 --> 11:36.340]  Um, we just saw Ohio vote on legalization and vote against it mainly because of
[11:36.340 --> 11:40.460]  those special rules. Um, they would have had legalization. They could have been
[11:40.460 --> 11:44.700]  shopping in weed stores, um, but chose not to because of who was going to
[11:44.700 --> 11:48.820]  profit the most from the production end of that industry. Um, so if it's
[11:48.820 --> 11:52.860]  written specifically for a bunch of people in your state to make money, uh,
[11:52.860 --> 11:58.860]  it's probably not going to pass. Um, California could go either way. Um,
[11:58.900 --> 12:03.340]  California never shies away from shooting itself in the foot here. Um,
[12:03.340 --> 12:11.100]  they led the way with medical in 96 and that existing industry, um, has often
[12:11.100 --> 12:16.260]  worked against legalization efforts. Um, there's a huge black market in
[12:16.260 --> 12:20.220]  California that also works against the legalization efforts. Um, and then
[12:20.220 --> 12:23.420]  there's all the anti pop people and some of the major anti marijuana groups in
[12:23.420 --> 12:29.380]  the country are based in California. Um, and all of that doesn't bode well for
[12:29.380 --> 12:32.380]  either of the initiatives in California that are being circulated for
[12:32.380 --> 12:36.580]  signatures right now. Um, I think the Sean Parker back initiative is already
[12:36.580 --> 12:40.580]  for sure on the ballot. Um, and I know that there's at least one other one
[12:40.580 --> 12:45.460]  looking to be on the ballot competing with it. Um, in florida, two different
[12:45.460 --> 12:49.820]  groups are collecting signatures right now, one for medical marijuana, one for
[12:49.820 --> 12:56.380]  full legalization. Um, both initiatives look really popular. Um, get out and
[12:56.380 --> 13:00.220]  find signatures. People find a place to sign and make sure you vote in
[13:00.220 --> 13:05.180]  November. Yeah, I have to interject here. Yeah, we came really close last
[13:05.180 --> 13:11.540]  year, like stupidly close. And you know, it's funny, like I have friends
[13:11.540 --> 13:14.820]  in florida who would just complain about the fact that it didn't get
[13:14.820 --> 13:17.180]  legalized and I'd be like, oh, well, like who did you vote for? And they'll
[13:17.180 --> 13:21.740]  be like, I didn't vote. I'm like, what? Right. What? You're upset, right? Like
[13:21.740 --> 13:25.780]  you actually got to get out on election day. It's really not that hard. Not at
[13:25.780 --> 13:28.740]  all. If you think your vote doesn't matter, the only way your vote doesn't
[13:28.740 --> 13:34.300]  matter is if you don't vote. Absolutely. You're Yeah, just fucking vote. Shout
[13:34.300 --> 13:39.340]  out to voting. Um, okay, so I'm gonna dab all day. Fucking vote. So that's
[13:39.340 --> 13:45.900]  florida, Maine, um, main, you guys might be vote non legalization. Um, the
[13:45.900 --> 13:49.940]  article I found on main didn't list whether it was legislative or a valid
[13:49.940 --> 13:53.340]  initiative. Um, it kind of made it sound like it was already on the ballot in
[13:53.340 --> 13:57.860]  2016. But if you live in Maine, you need to google it. Uh, Massachusetts
[13:57.860 --> 14:03.300]  legislative efforts are underway for decriminalization that would include
[14:03.300 --> 14:06.260]  legal possession. So it would be legal to possess a certain amount of
[14:06.260 --> 14:10.300]  marijuana. Um, but it's just decriminalization, which means it's
[14:10.300 --> 14:15.740]  still sold from a black market. Um, no, no taxes, no regulations, no lab
[14:15.740 --> 14:19.900]  testing, none of that. Um, and there's a group in Massachusetts looking to
[14:19.900 --> 14:25.220]  put the full legalization on the ballot and they're collecting signatures. Um,
[14:25.220 --> 14:30.700]  in Michigan, there's a group collecting signatures, um, for full legalization,
[14:30.700 --> 14:35.060]  including a 12 plant home grow, which would be double here in Colorado. Um,
[14:35.060 --> 14:38.820]  Michigan folks, I definitely look, get out and find a place to sign that
[14:38.820 --> 14:43.500]  petition. Uh, Missouri one groups collecting signatures for a
[14:43.500 --> 14:49.380]  legalization effort. Um, they look pretty good, uh, but it's gonna take
[14:49.380 --> 14:53.920]  people turning out to vote for it. Um, in Nevada, legalization will be on the
[14:53.920 --> 14:56.860]  ballot. Shout out to those folks in Missouri. Sorry, sorry to jump in there.
[14:56.860 --> 14:59.980]  I know those folks in Missouri, a shout out to Daryl and his wife, Trish.
[15:01.260 --> 15:03.620]  Those are the folks running the movement out there. I met with them a
[15:03.620 --> 15:09.540]  couple weeks ago. Nice. Um, Rhode Island in Vermont both have legislative
[15:09.540 --> 15:15.700]  efforts for legalization underway. Um, and then I didn't collect any detailed
[15:15.700 --> 15:19.740]  notes on the medical efforts. I'm surprised to see Mississippi on there.
[15:20.220 --> 15:27.220]  Um, and Ohio still reeling from that major loss, um, last November. So, uh,
[15:27.720 --> 15:31.620]  it doesn't surprise me that they're working on medical, um, instead of
[15:31.620 --> 15:33.420]  another full legalization effort.
[15:34.820 --> 15:39.500]  Yeah, that's, uh, those are the ones that are for sure already have major
[15:39.500 --> 15:44.520]  legalization groups or legislative efforts to legalize marijuana. Um, if
[15:44.520 --> 15:47.300]  you heard your state on the list, you either need to get out and sign that
[15:47.300 --> 15:52.620]  petition or hop on Google real quick. Look up who your elected representative
[15:52.620 --> 15:56.460]  is for your area for your state legislature. You need to give that
[15:56.460 --> 16:01.780]  person a call or email them. If you're shy at all, email him. It's super,
[16:01.780 --> 16:06.740]  super simple. Um, write him a little letter and email dear Mr. So and so.
[16:06.740 --> 16:11.100]  I'm one of your voters. I'd like you to vote yes on legalizing marijuana.
[16:11.100 --> 16:14.300]  That's all you have to say. If you want to get in and start making the
[16:14.300 --> 16:17.580]  arguments for him and helping him with that part of it to you can in your
[16:17.580 --> 16:22.580]  email. You don't have to be windy. Um, hi, Mr. So and so. Please vote yes on
[16:22.580 --> 16:25.900]  this. Thank you. That's all you need to write. The more people they hear that
[16:25.900 --> 16:29.940]  from, the more likely they are to vote for you to vote for what you're asking
[16:29.940 --> 16:34.460]  to vote for. So take the time and do it. Um, if you're a state where it's got,
[16:34.460 --> 16:38.300]  you need signatures gathered to get it on the ballot. Um, if the state
[16:38.300 --> 16:43.380]  requires 100,000 signatures, collect 300,000. Um, when you sign the
[16:43.380 --> 16:47.660]  petition, make sure that the petition signer knows that shit. Um, I see
[16:47.660 --> 16:52.460]  efforts fail to make the ballot every year because they needed 100,000. They
[16:52.460 --> 16:58.420]  turn in 50, 150,000 and then the state decertifies 80,000 and they're short.
[16:58.820 --> 17:06.460]  Um, that's happening in Maine right now. Um, and I think in Ohio as well. So
[17:06.480 --> 17:10.300]  when you're gathering signatures for marijuana, you need, you need to gather
[17:10.300 --> 17:13.620]  triple the signatures. Like it's incredibly difficult to get this stuff
[17:13.620 --> 17:18.660]  on the ballot, um, for a ballot initiative. Uh, but it's doable if you
[17:18.660 --> 17:21.980]  do it right. That's how Colorado did it. That's how a number of the other legal
[17:21.980 --> 17:23.140]  and medical states have done it.
[17:24.700 --> 17:30.100]  Awesome. That's really cool. Um, so in this upcoming election, which candidates
[17:30.100 --> 17:34.340]  um, does it look like, uh, will have the most positive influence on the
[17:34.340 --> 17:40.020]  cannabis industry if they're elected into office by far Bernie by miles.
[17:40.580 --> 17:44.300]  Um, a distant second would be Hillary who will probably continue the nonsense
[17:44.300 --> 17:49.700]  we're dealing with now from Obama. Um, most of the Republican candidates are
[17:49.700 --> 17:54.460]  either indifferent. Um, most of the, or all of the candidates at this point
[17:54.460 --> 17:58.180]  that had outright said that they would use their position as president to come
[17:58.180 --> 18:02.140]  in and shut down what we're doing in Colorado and Washington and Oregon. Um,
[18:02.140 --> 18:08.220]  and now Alaska, uh, they're off, they've dropped out of the race. Um, so
[18:08.220 --> 18:12.020]  that's done. We've gotten past that point in this election. That's a really
[18:12.020 --> 18:15.180]  good thing to know that at this point, like none of the candidates that are on
[18:15.180 --> 18:19.060]  there will try to shut it down. Yeah. Well, none of them have pledged to so
[18:19.060 --> 18:24.180]  far. Okay. Um, given the nature of politics in especially this fucking year,
[18:24.460 --> 18:30.060]  it's saying that it hasn't happened yet is a really safe bet. Um, God only knows
[18:30.060 --> 18:33.900]  where the election is going to go this year. Um, if you thought politics were
[18:33.900 --> 18:38.220]  boring, you're not watching the right news shows. I don't, I'm, I can't say
[18:38.220 --> 18:42.420]  that. I can't out loud say that I endorse any specific candidate, but, but
[18:42.420 --> 18:46.620]  if you were going to vote only based on cannabis, you got to vote on burn one.
[18:46.780 --> 18:49.820]  Yeah. That's definitely who you'd go for. If you're going to vote just on
[18:49.820 --> 18:53.100]  cannabis laws that dude used to go to grateful dead shows that dude protested
[18:53.100 --> 18:56.820]  at so many, if, if all those images I've seen, they're totally true. They've,
[18:56.860 --> 19:00.660]  they're checked by major media outlets, but here's the thing. If you want to
[19:00.700 --> 19:06.140]  vote for Bernie in November, you need to vote for Bernie. Now, um,
[19:06.220 --> 19:11.140]  odds are your state already had its primary caucus. If it hasn't yet,
[19:11.420 --> 19:15.780]  your ass needs to get in front of the computer right now and Google what you
[19:15.780 --> 19:20.700]  have to do to participate in your caucus. The odds are you're already locked out
[19:20.700 --> 19:25.060]  because you didn't do this a month ago, but that's not true in like half of the
[19:25.060 --> 19:29.780]  upcoming States or more. Um, so if you want a chance to vote for Bernie in
[19:29.820 --> 19:33.260]  November, you need to get out and vote for him now. Um,
[19:33.940 --> 19:37.580]  it just, it has to happen for him to get the democratic nomination.
[19:37.620 --> 19:41.340]  It's going to be a lot of work and a lot of people turn it out who don't usually
[19:41.340 --> 19:43.460]  turn out and that's your fan base.
[19:43.980 --> 19:44.900]  That is my fan base.
[19:45.060 --> 19:48.780]  If you guys want to vote for Bernie in November, it's you got to get out now.
[19:49.380 --> 19:50.220]  All right.
[19:50.780 --> 19:51.980]  And uh, most,
[19:51.980 --> 19:55.420]  some States have primary votes where you just go vote like you do in November.
[19:55.900 --> 19:57.900]  Um, each state's different.
[19:57.900 --> 20:00.980]  That's part of the, what you're Googling to see how to participate in it.
[20:00.980 --> 20:02.740]  It's not hard. It's not difficult.
[20:02.740 --> 20:06.180]  It won't be that big pain in the ass and it'll have major repercussions in
[20:06.180 --> 20:08.180]  November. So get out and do it.
[20:09.340 --> 20:12.620]  You can't bitch if you don't vote. No, you can't. All right.
[20:12.660 --> 20:15.220]  So we were talking about, uh,
[20:15.620 --> 20:18.500]  the candidates that are most pro cannabis.
[20:18.780 --> 20:22.460]  I think we can all agree that it's Mr. Bernie Sanders right there. Yeah. Yeah.
[20:22.460 --> 20:23.820]  By a mile. All right.
[20:23.820 --> 20:25.780]  So if Bernie gets elected into office,
[20:25.780 --> 20:28.900]  what does that mean for legal weed? Like across the nation?
[20:29.260 --> 20:33.940]  Uh, well, his campaign pledged so far only goes so far as to say he won't,
[20:34.660 --> 20:39.660]  uh, interrupt the experiments going on in legal States. Um,
[20:40.220 --> 20:42.900]  he's very set against the war on drugs.
[20:42.900 --> 20:47.620]  I think he's talked about decriminal or legalizing it federally. Um,
[20:48.260 --> 20:52.060]  on the record, this campaign, um, it's,
[20:52.220 --> 20:57.300]  um, as a president, he's got a couple of different options he could take.
[20:57.780 --> 21:01.100]  Um, the president could sign an executive order,
[21:01.500 --> 21:06.460]  which would legalize it federally, sort of, um,
[21:06.500 --> 21:09.220]  executive orders aren't federal law necessarily.
[21:09.220 --> 21:13.540]  Like there's a lot of contentious politics involved with executive orders,
[21:13.740 --> 21:16.660]  but, uh, the executive order, isn't a change in federal law.
[21:16.660 --> 21:19.140]  That would still mean marijuana is illegal federally.
[21:19.140 --> 21:24.100]  It's just the president signed an order saying who don't care. Um,
[21:24.860 --> 21:29.540]  what we really need to happen is an act of Congress. Um,
[21:29.540 --> 21:30.060]  and where the,
[21:30.060 --> 21:34.700]  whose president matters there is because they get to a bully pulpit is what they
[21:34.700 --> 21:37.460]  call it, where the president gets to say, Hey guys in Congress,
[21:38.500 --> 21:41.620]  it would be a really good idea if you worked on this. Um,
[21:41.620 --> 21:43.860]  and they do it all the time with all kinds of different shit.
[21:43.900 --> 21:45.980]  And there's no reason they can't do it with. All right,
[21:45.980 --> 21:48.340]  you guys were going to figure out how to legalize marijuana this year,
[21:48.380 --> 21:51.740]  do this, this, and this get on it. Um,
[21:52.220 --> 21:55.380]  and like he doesn't get to tell him like what to do, like, uh,
[21:55.540 --> 21:59.060]  your boss does it work, but it's similar. Um,
[21:59.340 --> 22:02.060]  with Obama, they just kind of look at him and nod their heads.
[22:02.060 --> 22:06.420]  And then half of the people elected to represent us have chose to do nothing for
[22:06.420 --> 22:10.020]  the last nine years. And it's been a fucking problem. Um, but
[22:12.060 --> 22:17.060]  getting Bernie into the presidency and paying attention to Senate races this
[22:17.260 --> 22:21.660]  year, major shifts in politics could happen. Um,
[22:21.700 --> 22:24.420]  over half of our elected representatives in Washington,
[22:24.420 --> 22:26.220]  D C right now are up for election.
[22:26.620 --> 22:30.700]  If we fire that many of them and replace them with quality candidates that are
[22:30.700 --> 22:32.380]  even mildly pro cannabis,
[22:32.820 --> 22:36.740]  26 teen could be a monumental year for legal marijuana.
[22:39.620 --> 22:40.740]  Oh my bad. I just went blank.
[22:42.140 --> 22:42.980]  I'll jump in for you.
[22:44.140 --> 22:48.140]  I think the podcast just, uh, accidentally full on endorsed Bernie Sanders.
[22:48.180 --> 22:51.580]  Yeah. So if you're a pro marijuana person,
[22:51.580 --> 22:54.620]  that's the logical rational choice. Yeah, definitely. So, um,
[22:54.660 --> 22:56.900]  there's a lot of mostly, and then there's dark. Yeah.
[22:56.900 --> 22:59.500]  There are a lot of arguments to be made after that, but right.
[22:59.500 --> 23:01.700]  That's what you're looking at. A hundred percent is cannabis.
[23:01.700 --> 23:03.860]  Then you that's where your money and vote would go.
[23:04.140 --> 23:06.460]  I'm very much not a one issue voter,
[23:06.460 --> 23:10.820]  but marijuana legalization is very near and dear to my heart. Um,
[23:10.980 --> 23:14.660]  and I can see voting in an election like this based purely on that.
[23:14.660 --> 23:20.060]  Um, my, my life is 98.7%, uh,
[23:20.380 --> 23:23.460]  funded by the legalization of cannabis.
[23:23.540 --> 23:28.100]  Right. That's only like 25% true for me, but like, yeah,
[23:28.340 --> 23:30.020]  that's 0% true for me, but I,
[23:30.060 --> 23:33.420]  that's still like a big aspect for why I'm voting to be honest.
[23:33.700 --> 23:38.700]  It's I've studied this for so long and just having it pro pro,
[23:39.060 --> 23:44.060]  uh, prohibited, just that concept in our law has ruined so many things.
[23:44.620 --> 23:49.620]  Um, it's infected every part of American life from politics to medicine,
[23:49.740 --> 23:54.100]  to how we interact with each other, our neighbors, the police, how they,
[23:54.220 --> 23:57.100]  how the police interact with us. Um, it's,
[23:57.140 --> 24:02.100]  it's just poisoned everything it's touched and it's touched everything and it
[24:02.100 --> 24:02.940]  has to stop.
[24:02.980 --> 24:07.460]  And it stops this election year when people under 30 turn out and vote,
[24:08.580 --> 24:12.060]  which will hopefully happen a lot more this year than it has in the past.
[24:12.700 --> 24:16.700]  We've seen so many people turning out for caucuses and voting pro Bernie in a
[24:16.700 --> 24:20.340]  lot of places. Uh, we've been setting records for caucus attendances,
[24:20.900 --> 24:22.780]  caucus attendance. Yeah.
[24:22.900 --> 24:25.460]  So it's there are going to be a lot of new voters out there this year.
[24:25.580 --> 24:30.340]  There are, there are more than usual energized, but we've seen this before.
[24:30.860 --> 24:34.380]  Um, if you're a political junkie, they refer to it as getting do caucused.
[24:35.060 --> 24:39.340]  Um, it's a guy who could have been president and everybody thought he was going
[24:39.340 --> 24:41.380]  to be in all the college kids were going to vote for him.
[24:41.380 --> 24:45.460]  And then he lost in a fucking landslide to a nightmare of a Republican.
[24:46.900 --> 24:50.260]  Um, and it happens. Uh, Bernie's really,
[24:50.260 --> 24:51.660]  really popular and he could,
[24:51.700 --> 24:55.220]  he could lose in a landslide to the Republican nominee,
[24:55.220 --> 24:59.060]  whoever that ends up being God, don't let it be Trump. And, uh,
[25:00.500 --> 25:03.740]  he could lose to Hillary in the primary and we could be voting Hillary versus
[25:03.740 --> 25:07.820]  somebody. And then what that means for legalization is very different.
[25:08.820 --> 25:12.260]  Trump just is fucking crazy, dude. I was going to, I was,
[25:12.260 --> 25:13.180]  I was going to buy it.
[25:13.820 --> 25:16.580]  We're fucking living a Mad Max movie inside four years.
[25:19.540 --> 25:22.340]  I've already, and I know everyone says this, but like,
[25:22.340 --> 25:26.900]  I've already let it be very well known that I will probably leave the United
[25:26.900 --> 25:30.740]  States. Um, I have family in England. I,
[25:31.100 --> 25:34.940]  you've got a life boat. You got to get out. Yeah. I might,
[25:34.980 --> 25:36.420]  I might actually jump ship. I mean,
[25:36.420 --> 25:39.580]  I've always wanted to go backpacking and like do the Europe thing anyways.
[25:39.580 --> 25:43.860]  So like, thanks for helping me make that decision. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
[25:43.860 --> 25:47.940]  I don't know what I'm going to do if that dude gets elected. Yeah, dude,
[25:47.940 --> 25:50.500]  I'm going to ride the boat till it crumbles. My life will change.
[25:50.540 --> 25:53.020]  That is an absolute thing. Yeah, absolutely.
[25:53.180 --> 25:55.820]  So I guess my next question actually goes to both of you then.
[25:55.940 --> 25:58.580]  So realistically, um,
[25:59.380 --> 26:03.820]  is legalizing marijuana across the nation, something we want to see?
[26:04.340 --> 26:08.780]  Um, I know for myself I can say yes, but I know that my reasons,
[26:08.780 --> 26:12.820]  and I guess, um, I would rather hear both of yours.
[26:13.300 --> 26:14.860]  Don't go for it or you want me to take it first?
[26:16.620 --> 26:21.300]  I'm, I'm happy to take it. Go for it. Yes. Um,
[26:21.340 --> 26:24.460]  it's a great thing for legalization. Um,
[26:25.540 --> 26:28.940]  the people who are doing it right are going to be able to do it right across the
[26:28.940 --> 26:30.340]  country. And the,
[26:30.380 --> 26:35.300]  the people that want to come in and take over or come in and corporatize can't
[26:35.460 --> 26:37.460]  compete. Like,
[26:38.220 --> 26:41.460]  I don't know any beer drinkers who would be pumped if another's Coors Light came
[26:41.460 --> 26:42.300]  on the market.
[26:42.540 --> 26:46.540]  I know a lot of beer drinkers who are pumped regularly about some small craft
[26:46.540 --> 26:49.340]  brewery coming on market. Um,
[26:49.980 --> 26:53.460]  people who build up quality and churn out quality are what we need in this
[26:53.460 --> 26:57.940]  industry. Um, federal legalization opens up, um,
[26:57.940 --> 27:01.180]  do the lab testing problem goes away overnight. Right. Um,
[27:01.180 --> 27:04.140]  we can use the same labs to test the cantaloupe and the shampoo.
[27:05.060 --> 27:07.540]  The pesticide goes over, goes out overnight.
[27:07.580 --> 27:11.980]  Immediately the pesticide manufacturers are able to run the studies needed to put
[27:11.980 --> 27:13.060]  cannabis on the label.
[27:13.620 --> 27:17.020]  All the ones that already know they can because it's on the label for tobacco
[27:17.460 --> 27:19.300]  will have those studies done in hours.
[27:19.340 --> 27:23.460]  All of the seizure studies would be able to be done for the children.
[27:23.460 --> 27:24.540]  All of that medical research.
[27:24.540 --> 27:26.980]  Children and adults that have epilepsy. Hashtag Terps4Tots.
[27:27.580 --> 27:31.820]  Like I get that Marlboro is going to come in and plant five or 500 acres worth of
[27:31.820 --> 27:35.980]  shitty weed and roll it up and throw it on the shelf at six and a half percent
[27:35.980 --> 27:38.820]  pre-rolled joints in a fucking little pack.
[27:38.860 --> 27:41.980]  And it's going to be cute and it's going to eat a part of the market for people
[27:41.980 --> 27:43.940]  who don't know any better, but I don't care.
[27:44.260 --> 27:46.180]  So do you think there's too much benefit to it?
[27:46.180 --> 27:49.660]  It's completely federally legal and there are places,
[27:49.900 --> 27:51.740]  and I'm going to compare it to the beer model. Like you did.
[27:51.740 --> 27:56.740]  There's a cannabis manufacturer that's the same size as Bush or Coors making
[27:56.980 --> 27:59.700]  producing mass produced cannabis,
[28:00.260 --> 28:03.620]  terp free cannabis and then there are still niche gardens like green and healthy
[28:03.620 --> 28:05.020]  wellness and a few others.
[28:05.580 --> 28:08.580]  There are a few other shops that I totally would shop at and buy their product.
[28:09.580 --> 28:13.340]  Do you think that those shops are still going to survive with that large market?
[28:13.340 --> 28:15.660]  Like the Coors type of stores that are coming out?
[28:15.700 --> 28:16.620]  For sure. Okay.
[28:17.380 --> 28:18.300]  There'll be a,
[28:18.380 --> 28:21.220]  there'll be a section of them that get bought up because when,
[28:21.260 --> 28:24.860]  when a Marlboro or a Coors or fuck those companies, but you get what I mean?
[28:25.020 --> 28:25.540]  Yeah.
[28:25.540 --> 28:29.820]  When they step in, they don't create from the ground up. They look at you,
[28:29.820 --> 28:30.780]  they see what you're doing.
[28:31.020 --> 28:33.900]  They hit you in the face with a check bigger than you've ever imagined.
[28:33.940 --> 28:37.900]  You walk away, they replicate your business model as a franchise.
[28:38.940 --> 28:42.420]  And then there's going to be the people who do this because they love it.
[28:42.460 --> 28:46.980]  They're going to not sell out. They're going to slowly expand.
[28:47.180 --> 28:51.980]  There's a million people who wish they could just hop online and order your
[28:51.980 --> 28:55.300]  seeds that can't because it's not legal federally.
[28:55.820 --> 28:59.580]  Um, it's a federal offense to mail those to people.
[28:59.900 --> 29:03.780]  They can't buy them. Like all that goes away overnight.
[29:04.020 --> 29:08.300]  People can just hop online, buy your seeds and enjoy life.
[29:08.380 --> 29:11.940]  A hundred percent legally without having to worry about shit. Um,
[29:12.020 --> 29:16.180]  and the benefit for the industry sky high right now,
[29:16.180 --> 29:21.180]  there was just report that the legal industry is worth $4.4 billion this year.
[29:21.940 --> 29:26.940]  Uh, it's going to grow to $40 billion by 2020 if States continue to legalize like
[29:27.260 --> 29:29.020]  they have. Um,
[29:29.180 --> 29:32.660]  the last estimate I read on the black market was Americans are spending 60
[29:32.660 --> 29:35.180]  billion on marijuana right now. Um,
[29:35.300 --> 29:39.100]  you figure a third or more of that's the black market, uh, markup.
[29:40.420 --> 29:44.260]  I mean the, the industry is worth 44, $45 billion nationwide.
[29:44.620 --> 29:47.860]  If you're able to export to England every now and again,
[29:47.860 --> 29:51.540]  or whatever else is other countries start to legalize and the demand for
[29:51.540 --> 29:55.060]  American quality cannabis spreads around the globe,
[29:55.740 --> 29:57.420]  that growth is exponential.
[29:57.780 --> 30:00.820]  The idea that you're going to get squeezed out if you're good at what you're
[30:00.820 --> 30:03.780]  doing and you're a competent business owner is just not there.
[30:04.860 --> 30:06.740]  Mike, you ever do a mic drop? Nope.
[30:08.700 --> 30:10.980]  I just feel like that's like the end of the podcast, right? That's the,
[30:12.260 --> 30:15.580]  that's why I want to choke the fucking stoners against legalization.
[30:15.580 --> 30:20.580]  Like I see people every day online that are actively lobbying against whatever
[30:20.620 --> 30:25.540]  legalization efforts going on in their area because it legalizes marijuana
[30:25.540 --> 30:29.620]  somewhere in between alcohol and uh,
[30:29.660 --> 30:32.620]  tobacco, not like tomatoes.
[30:33.060 --> 30:35.220]  So like you can only produce so much of it.
[30:35.220 --> 30:37.700]  There are rules on if you produce it in your home,
[30:37.700 --> 30:41.140]  who you can sell it to or give it away to, or not be allowed to sell it to.
[30:41.140 --> 30:44.100]  That's something I was going to definitely mention is you got to be careful when
[30:44.220 --> 30:46.500]  you're going to make the, when it goes federally legal,
[30:46.500 --> 30:49.380]  we have to be careful about what we get,
[30:49.540 --> 30:53.260]  like what we ask for because there needs to be certain rules about growing.
[30:53.620 --> 30:56.460]  If we're all limited to six plants, that's going to fuck some things up.
[30:56.460 --> 30:59.900]  We need usable numbers, more viable plant numbers.
[30:59.900 --> 31:02.060]  We need just a little better rule. So when it comes time,
[31:02.060 --> 31:04.180]  we got to be careful that we get the right stuff that we want.
[31:04.260 --> 31:06.060]  It's so weird in Colorado right now,
[31:06.060 --> 31:10.340]  especially when we're extrapolating to federal legalization because right now
[31:10.340 --> 31:14.460]  those rules really help keep the idiots from fucking this up for all of us.
[31:15.700 --> 31:18.300]  Already we've got major problems.
[31:19.140 --> 31:21.500]  Mostly PR problems like nobody's been hurt.
[31:22.700 --> 31:27.020]  But massive outdoor grows where, okay,
[31:27.020 --> 31:29.100]  so a few people have been hurt. That was a fair head shake.
[31:29.940 --> 31:34.580]  But massive outdoor grows that off the neighbors that lead to articles in the
[31:34.580 --> 31:38.020]  press about what bastards we are and how the system's being manipulated.
[31:38.900 --> 31:43.260]  All of that leads to major blowback that has political ramifications,
[31:43.260 --> 31:44.380]  including our area,
[31:44.380 --> 31:47.540]  possibly voting to ban the legal marijuana industry this November.
[31:48.620 --> 31:52.620]  That's a real fucking possibility mainly because there's been a lot of blowback
[31:52.620 --> 31:54.500]  lately about huge outdoor grows.
[31:55.300 --> 32:00.100]  People with a 20 and 30 plant count doing 20 or 30 VW bus size plants in their
[32:00.100 --> 32:04.660]  fucking suburban backyard like a douche bag. Yeah, that's not allowed. Nope.
[32:04.740 --> 32:08.740]  And it pisses all the neighbors off and it looks terrible in the press and it's
[32:08.740 --> 32:12.260]  going to lead to sick kids losing out on their medicine because caregivers are
[32:12.260 --> 32:14.220]  going to get quashed here in about five years.
[32:14.740 --> 32:17.940]  They're already pushing the caregiver model out of the Colorado business plan.
[32:17.980 --> 32:19.420]  It's already going away. Yep.
[32:21.020 --> 32:25.740]  And so it's really time it like if you care about
[32:25.740 --> 32:29.580]  marijuana legalization or you want to be part of this industry to really start
[32:29.580 --> 32:31.020]  paying attention and getting involved.
[32:31.740 --> 32:34.580]  Um, because right now everything is happening.
[32:34.580 --> 32:38.860]  It's actually becoming legal everywhere very slowly,
[32:38.860 --> 32:42.380]  but it's happening. Like it's, we're moving forward every two years.
[32:43.140 --> 32:47.660]  And if people turn out and vote and the numbers that they can Facebook post,
[32:48.460 --> 32:51.300]  um, Bernie wins in a landslide,
[32:51.500 --> 32:56.500]  huge numbers of congressmen get replaced and we actually make major progress on
[32:56.780 --> 32:59.660]  marijuana law for the first time federally in 80 years.
[33:00.660 --> 33:02.140]  We can be a part of that revolution.
[33:02.180 --> 33:04.100]  All you got to do is get out there and vote.
[33:04.180 --> 33:05.980]  We already told you who to vote for accidentally.
[33:08.180 --> 33:11.500]  We really didn't intend to endorse a specific candidate beginning of this show,
[33:11.500 --> 33:15.180]  but if you're your only vote topic is marijuana, you really got to vote for
[33:15.180 --> 33:15.620]  Bernie.
[33:15.620 --> 33:18.420]  Yeah. Well, so then I guess that, uh,
[33:18.460 --> 33:21.700]  that kind of leads right there into my next question. Um,
[33:21.820 --> 33:24.700]  what serious changes will occur? Um,
[33:24.820 --> 33:28.980]  if Bernie, a pro marijuana candidate, um,
[33:29.180 --> 33:32.620]  is elected into office like federally and statewide,
[33:32.660 --> 33:35.660]  obviously it'll change the drug classification of it,
[33:36.140 --> 33:38.980]  which will mean that it'll be able to be studied and all that.
[33:39.580 --> 33:43.780]  Um, the, the change at the federal level is just so huge.
[33:43.780 --> 33:46.020]  We will be able to put our money in a bank.
[33:46.220 --> 33:46.860]  Yep. I mean,
[33:46.860 --> 33:51.860]  we've spent 80 years thinking up ways to make it harder to grow weed and every
[33:52.420 --> 33:55.860]  single one of those rules is still in place for the legal industry.
[33:57.820 --> 34:01.140]  And changing the federal law lets us change all of those, the banking,
[34:01.140 --> 34:06.100]  the lab testing, the packaging requirements, the state line rules.
[34:06.660 --> 34:07.220]  I get,
[34:07.220 --> 34:10.540]  I get five calls a week at the shop about people wondering where the buy now
[34:10.540 --> 34:15.020]  button is on our website. And, um, like I, I,
[34:15.340 --> 34:17.660]  I get it like you buy everything online now,
[34:17.660 --> 34:20.740]  like you're probably not going to be buying weed online now, anytime soon.
[34:20.740 --> 34:22.540]  But, um,
[34:23.660 --> 34:27.300]  it should be there like everything else. And it can be if it's federally legal,
[34:27.700 --> 34:31.340]  but just changing who the president is, um,
[34:31.340 --> 34:35.620]  it's sort of like the first step and that's not how we get this battle one
[34:35.700 --> 34:39.740]  necessarily. That's, that's the next best step. Um,
[34:39.780 --> 34:43.780]  the real change happens like regardless of who gets elected the next election,
[34:44.580 --> 34:49.580]  um, calling your state legislatures, calling your state senators, um,
[34:49.820 --> 34:51.380]  just Google it, figure out who they are.
[34:51.380 --> 34:54.340]  It's their job to listen to bullshit when people call them and you didn't
[34:54.340 --> 34:55.100]  Yammer it stuff.
[34:55.100 --> 34:58.900]  That's their job is for people that live from whatever area of the country
[34:58.900 --> 35:01.980]  they're from call and talk to them and it's their job to listen.
[35:02.580 --> 35:06.340]  And then it's their job to go pass laws based on how many people call them that
[35:06.340 --> 35:10.980]  week and said, vote yes or vote no. Um, so literally this stuff matters.
[35:11.380 --> 35:15.020]  There are a number of areas, cities, towns, um,
[35:15.060 --> 35:19.900]  counties that are voting on marijuana legalization far ahead of their states.
[35:20.380 --> 35:23.780]  Um, I just saw new Orleans to criminalized it.
[35:23.780 --> 35:26.380]  Fucking Louisiana is never gonna. Um,
[35:26.420 --> 35:30.540]  but new Orleans just passed a law or maybe not full decriminalization,
[35:30.560 --> 35:34.700]  but they just did some sentencing reform guidelines. Um,
[35:34.740 --> 35:38.260]  I've been posting a story all week of about a dude who got 13 years for two
[35:38.260 --> 35:41.540]  joints in new Orleans. That's ridiculous. Yep.
[35:41.620 --> 35:43.980]  It's part of their three strikes and your fuck law.
[35:44.020 --> 35:47.780]  There's enough hash on this table to lock up everyone in New Orleans. Yep.
[35:48.340 --> 35:52.660]  Um, Miami, Florida decriminalized it, uh, last year didn't, or this year,
[35:52.700 --> 35:53.540]  earlier this year.
[35:53.540 --> 35:57.580]  So yeah, yeah. I think anything cities, towns and counties everywhere are,
[35:57.620 --> 36:02.620]  and they're doing it because the local officials in those areas got swamped with
[36:03.660 --> 36:07.180]  pro marijuana supporters calling, Hey, I'm a voter in your district.
[36:07.220 --> 36:10.780]  I'm pro marijuana. Let's legalize it in the city. Um,
[36:11.060 --> 36:14.980]  enough people called enough people got active and that's what everybody listening
[36:14.980 --> 36:19.140]  to the show needs to do. If you live in another country, um,
[36:19.420 --> 36:21.460]  unless it's like North Korea, odds are,
[36:21.460 --> 36:25.140]  you've got a system of representative government of some sort. Um,
[36:25.180 --> 36:28.140]  you can do a lot of this too, because I know we've got a listeners in Australia.
[36:28.140 --> 36:30.660]  If you're listening from North Korea, please send me a tweet,
[36:33.220 --> 36:35.740]  seriously. I'd love to know if you're listening in Korea,
[36:36.140 --> 36:38.300]  GFYH podcast on Twitter. I want to know.
[36:38.300 --> 36:42.020]  And also huge shout out to our supporter in Australia. Uh, we've,
[36:42.020 --> 36:44.620]  I'm sure we've got several, but we've got one guy out there that is a huge
[36:44.620 --> 36:47.780]  supporter. Uh, what's up my Rasta friend. Thanks for listening to the show.
[36:49.380 --> 36:52.060]  Um, but yeah, get involved, get active. Cause there's a lot you can do,
[36:52.060 --> 36:55.380]  even on a local level. If you live in a state that's, um,
[36:55.420 --> 36:59.980]  never going to legalize it, you might live in a city that will Austin.
[37:03.060 --> 37:05.100]  So in your opinion,
[37:05.100 --> 37:09.420]  out of the States that have legalized marijuana already, um,
[37:09.460 --> 37:12.500]  which state is doing it right in the way of laws,
[37:12.540 --> 37:17.140]  like who has a good set of laws put in place to make a
[37:17.140 --> 37:20.460]  cannabis industry actually grow and not have issues.
[37:21.780 --> 37:26.860]  None of them are perfect yet, but I tend to, it might be biased,
[37:26.860 --> 37:31.380]  but I took a quick glance at the rules again today and I vote Colorado by a mile.
[37:32.140 --> 37:32.980]  Um,
[37:33.300 --> 37:37.660]  Washington's drastically overtaxing marijuana and has caused all sorts of price
[37:37.660 --> 37:42.700]  issues and issues industry wide, um, between the city, the state, the County,
[37:42.700 --> 37:43.580]  the, uh,
[37:43.660 --> 37:47.100]  in the federal sales taxes that the legal marijuana industry pays,
[37:47.540 --> 37:49.780]  having a statewide tax rate of 30,
[37:49.780 --> 37:54.180]  35% is enough to keep the shop from being able to profit at all.
[37:54.620 --> 37:58.220]  And that's terrible for the industry. It's in on the black market. Yup. If,
[37:58.380 --> 38:01.100]  if the shops can't profit, um,
[38:02.260 --> 38:06.260]  they can't pay their people what they're worth. They can't provide insurance. Um,
[38:06.300 --> 38:10.220]  they can't reinvest in their business and there's no reason to get involved in
[38:10.220 --> 38:13.780]  it. Um, just stay in the black market. The black market will be fine.
[38:13.780 --> 38:16.220]  Just like it was last year. Um,
[38:17.860 --> 38:22.380]  it always exists. It's never going away. I mean, Oregon's got its own issues.
[38:22.460 --> 38:27.740]  Um, whole new set of issues. Yeah. A whole new set of issues as yesterday. Um,
[38:28.020 --> 38:30.860]  but Colorado is far from perfect to weird.
[38:30.900 --> 38:35.780]  Social clubs are very gray area in our law. Some areas allow them.
[38:35.820 --> 38:40.700]  No area has shops up and running where they're allowed. Um,
[38:41.100 --> 38:44.820]  Colorado Springs just voted to ban all the shops, um,
[38:44.820 --> 38:46.780]  but gave them eight years to shut down, which is
[38:47.900 --> 38:51.380]  eight years. So yeah, they're too dangerous to allow to continue to exist.
[38:51.380 --> 38:53.420]  So they have to shut them down, but they gave them eight years.
[38:54.420 --> 38:57.460]  They actually said that they're going to vote again within that eight years.
[38:57.540 --> 39:01.020]  Oh, they're probably going to vote at least eight times. Yes. Um,
[39:01.060 --> 39:02.540]  hopefully we can turn it around there.
[39:02.540 --> 39:06.380]  So when you guys are writing the rules in your state or city or a County or
[39:06.380 --> 39:10.220]  whatever it may be on your Island, uh, in your bubble,
[39:10.340 --> 39:12.900]  when you're making the rules for your cannabis laws,
[39:12.940 --> 39:17.940]  be sure to include some sort of way to consume that cannabis legally and
[39:17.980 --> 39:21.140]  safely with your friends. There are places to go to drink alcohol.
[39:21.340 --> 39:22.180]  We can all go gather.
[39:22.340 --> 39:26.660]  I can name 12 places within five minutes of here that we can all go get drunk
[39:26.660 --> 39:30.060]  until we die. But there's nowhere that we get other than right here at this
[39:30.060 --> 39:33.060]  table that we can all congregate and safely consume cannabis without any
[39:33.060 --> 39:33.900]  problems.
[39:35.740 --> 39:37.500]  We take it as kind of a given,
[39:37.520 --> 39:42.520]  but there's a huge contingent of people out there that want no rules and they
[39:42.700 --> 39:45.700]  think that's possible. And it's not,
[39:46.540 --> 39:51.540]  it's marijuana might be the most safe intoxicant known to mankind.
[39:52.300 --> 39:55.220]  It might be the most beneficial plant known to mankind.
[39:55.700 --> 40:00.620]  None of that means you're going to legalize it to be produced in the home at any
[40:00.620 --> 40:05.700]  amount with no regulation or no rules as to how or where it can be grown.
[40:05.700 --> 40:09.220]  Like you'll never be able to grow it like tomatoes. Um,
[40:09.580 --> 40:14.100]  at best you'll be able to produce it like homebrew alcohol works. Um,
[40:14.780 --> 40:18.780]  and we need some of those rules, honestly. Um,
[40:19.020 --> 40:22.780]  with the abuses we see just in the legal States that are going now,
[40:22.780 --> 40:25.020]  like there are idiots everywhere.
[40:25.020 --> 40:28.700]  Like in we kind of have to set up the rules for the slowest link.
[40:28.740 --> 40:29.700]  You know what I mean? Like,
[40:29.860 --> 40:33.060]  Oh, there was the guy growing eight foot tall trees in his backyard here in our
[40:33.060 --> 40:36.660]  neighborhood. Yeah. And some kids tried to steal his trees and he shot them.
[40:37.020 --> 40:39.860]  Like, thank God it was a fucking pellet gun. Um,
[40:39.900 --> 40:43.260]  but there's been others that are home invasion robberies because they've got a
[40:43.260 --> 40:47.900]  ridiculous grow going and yeah, it's legal here, dude. Congrats bro.
[40:48.260 --> 40:51.740]  But it's not legal to stay over. It's in fact worth 8,000 a pound.
[40:52.300 --> 40:56.500]  And you've got $400,000 worth of marijuana in your suburban backyard in the
[40:56.500 --> 41:00.860]  ghetto. Like that's your life. Like 12 times over, bro.
[41:00.860 --> 41:05.900]  What were you thinking? Um, like not only did you put yourself at risk,
[41:05.900 --> 41:09.620]  everybody else in your house at risk, your neighbors at risk. Um,
[41:09.660 --> 41:13.900]  but you shot the whole movement in the foot at the same time. Um,
[41:13.940 --> 41:17.380]  and I honestly don't want my fucking kid climbing over your fence and stealing
[41:17.380 --> 41:21.180]  your weed when he's 12, like making fucking hassle bums.
[41:21.740 --> 41:25.780]  Like I had to do with boost and I was getting gassed today and a dude who
[41:25.780 --> 41:29.460]  looked well like decent shoes and looked clean. He's like, bro,
[41:29.460 --> 41:30.900]  you got an extra couple of balls.
[41:31.900 --> 41:34.980]  I looked at him like the fuck, like what the fuck does it like?
[41:35.420 --> 41:37.180]  I didn't even know what to think, dude. I was like, what?
[41:38.020 --> 41:43.020]  Right. It's spare change. Not do you have $47? A couple of extra bowls.
[41:43.100 --> 41:46.140]  Like maybe like if I had a roadshow to hooked you up,
[41:46.140 --> 41:48.460]  do you think I throw it on a couple of extra bowl? I don't know.
[41:48.460 --> 41:50.620]  Maybe if I had a nugget, I might've thrown it his way.
[41:50.780 --> 41:54.260]  Yeah. But a nugget is a bowl, right? I mean like, or I guess it's a,
[41:54.940 --> 41:56.860]  I thought about offering him, I was like,
[41:56.860 --> 42:00.340]  you should just get in the car and take the biggest fucking dab you've ever had
[42:00.340 --> 42:03.820]  is what I thought about doing to the kid. But it wasn't the right time.
[42:04.900 --> 42:07.900]  Didn't seem right. Yeah. Didn't seem right at all.
[42:08.940 --> 42:11.620]  Um, got more questions for white Mike.
[42:12.300 --> 42:14.300]  There's a couple more questions on the list. Yeah.
[42:14.460 --> 42:18.220]  Oh yeah. Mike got the list also. Yeah. Everyone's got the list. Um,
[42:18.220 --> 42:21.540]  yeah. Uh, okay. So what other States, um,
[42:21.660 --> 42:23.980]  except other States medical cards.
[42:24.100 --> 42:27.500]  Okay. The only state that does, uh, they call that reciprocity.
[42:27.500 --> 42:29.940]  The only state that I know that does that is Nevada.
[42:30.660 --> 42:34.500]  And they accept all other States or just as far as I'm aware,
[42:34.500 --> 42:39.340]  Nevada is medical marijuana dispensaries except medical marijuana cards from all
[42:39.340 --> 42:40.900]  other States. Um,
[42:40.940 --> 42:44.940]  which is great for the medical marijuana industry in Nevada because last I
[42:44.980 --> 42:47.660]  checked, they had like 10 or 14,000 patients.
[42:47.700 --> 42:50.820]  That just changed a lot of cool things because one of our very good friends is
[42:50.820 --> 42:54.180]  getting married there on the 23rd of July and I've been invited to their wedding.
[42:54.260 --> 42:54.820]  Nice.
[42:54.820 --> 42:57.780]  And so that means that I can travel and I can stop at a dispensary and I can
[42:57.780 --> 42:59.260]  pick up some products. Yep.
[43:00.620 --> 43:03.700]  I haven't wanted to go to Vegas since I was like 24. Um,
[43:03.740 --> 43:06.700]  and I suddenly it's back on the list of to do's.
[43:06.860 --> 43:09.460]  Shout out to Arnie and Ravay. Congrats on the wedding. You guys.
[43:10.740 --> 43:14.740]  I've never been to Vegas, so that might have to happen soon.
[43:14.740 --> 43:17.740]  It's a, it's, you definitely do it a couple of times before you die.
[43:18.260 --> 43:20.940]  I just told everybody that I'll be in Vegas on July 23rd.
[43:23.220 --> 43:27.980]  I haven't wanted to go to Vegas to quit drinking and legal weed or legal access
[43:27.980 --> 43:31.660]  to my medical marijuana to be more specific. Do you think, uh,
[43:31.820 --> 43:36.180]  do you think being high will improve your gambling? Oh, by miles. Yeah, bro.
[43:36.180 --> 43:37.180]  That's yo. Yeah.
[43:37.940 --> 43:39.940]  I'm not a drinker. So that's what I was going to say about the smoke,
[43:39.980 --> 43:40.860]  smoking clubs thing.
[43:40.860 --> 43:43.540]  Like that's a huge thing for me because I don't drink,
[43:43.540 --> 43:45.980]  I haven't drank in maybe two or three years now.
[43:45.980 --> 43:47.740]  Like I don't really do anything else.
[43:47.740 --> 43:51.180]  So smoking is really important to me and like being able to have somewhere to go
[43:51.180 --> 43:52.540]  and to do that as like really important.
[43:52.740 --> 43:55.900]  So knowing that I can go to other States and like consume cannabis without having
[43:55.900 --> 43:57.460]  any issues or anything is like a really,
[43:58.500 --> 44:02.460]  I think it was Matt that said on a past episode that they made bars so that you
[44:02.460 --> 44:04.460]  don't have people drinking on the streets all day.
[44:04.500 --> 44:07.500]  They need to make cannabis social clubs so that we're not out in our car trying
[44:07.500 --> 44:09.860]  to dab at the fucking Safeway parking lot.
[44:10.220 --> 44:13.140]  Right. And then we get a DUI. Right. Yep. Yeah.
[44:13.460 --> 44:17.700]  Yeah. You gotta know there's so many different or some stupid shit. Right.
[44:17.860 --> 44:21.060]  Like legalization doesn't exist in a vacuum.
[44:21.060 --> 44:23.540]  Like it has to be practicable just like everything else.
[44:24.100 --> 44:27.780]  And there are a lot of people who live in places where they can't smoke. Um,
[44:27.820 --> 44:30.660]  there are a lot of people who live in situations where they can't smoke.
[44:30.780 --> 44:35.540]  I'm about to be in one. Um, and it gets cold fucking in Colorado during the
[44:35.540 --> 44:39.220]  winter. Um, and so you've, you know,
[44:39.260 --> 44:41.660]  you need places to go where you can legally consume.
[44:41.660 --> 44:45.220]  You don't want to be standing out in an alley if you don't have to be. Um,
[44:45.220 --> 44:49.180]  and there's no reason to have that be the legal consumption method. Uh,
[44:49.180 --> 44:52.340]  I fucking hate tourists or telling tourists that just go to the back of the
[44:52.340 --> 44:56.860]  hotel parking lot. Like we should have a better answer than that. Right. Um,
[44:56.900 --> 45:01.260]  smoke out your car. Yeah. I love the points that got made on, um, that show,
[45:01.260 --> 45:05.660]  that last show at candy Canyon, um, about like, we've got kids now.
[45:05.660 --> 45:07.980]  Like I don't necessarily want to explain that.
[45:07.980 --> 45:11.220]  Like I want to do that on my own time. Um,
[45:11.380 --> 45:15.420]  I don't want to have to explain that shit in the park or fucking anywhere else.
[45:15.420 --> 45:19.980]  Like it's signs are one thing. Like, what are those guys doing over there?
[45:19.980 --> 45:22.060]  Like that looks fun. Should we go do that dad?
[45:22.060 --> 45:24.780]  Like I want to skip those questions for as long as possible.
[45:24.780 --> 45:26.620]  And if there are consumption clubs,
[45:27.220 --> 45:30.660]  that conversation really comes up like that. If I'm at a consumption club.
[45:32.180 --> 45:35.460]  Yeah. Right. And then it's fucking on me because I've got my 12 year old,
[45:35.500 --> 45:38.260]  the consumption club. Like I'm the douchebag in that situation.
[45:38.260 --> 45:41.660]  I think I smoking weed. You guys, they will not let, right.
[45:41.700 --> 45:44.980]  That's not even possible. You can fully have your 12 year old in the bar.
[45:45.620 --> 45:47.100]  Just I'm going to lay that out on the table.
[45:50.140 --> 45:54.060]  It's really gotta be hard to telling people that about the hotel because you're
[45:54.060 --> 45:55.460]  putting them at risk too.
[45:55.460 --> 45:59.980]  Because if a cop were to catch them smoking out in the open, they get,
[45:59.980 --> 46:02.500]  you know, they still get a fine or whatever it is here.
[46:02.700 --> 46:05.500]  We had a friend who got caught smoking in a parking lot.
[46:05.500 --> 46:07.540]  He didn't have anywhere to be for a little while.
[46:07.540 --> 46:10.500]  He parked underneath the stoplight or the, just the light,
[46:10.500 --> 46:12.540]  the street street light there and was chilling out,
[46:12.860 --> 46:15.580]  loaded himself up a bowl and took a couple of puffs off the bowl.
[46:15.820 --> 46:18.580]  As he was blown out of hit cop walked up to his window and knocked on his
[46:18.580 --> 46:19.420]  window.
[46:19.540 --> 46:22.420]  He had no choice but to roll down the window and let the smoke billow out into
[46:22.420 --> 46:23.500]  the cop's face. And he just,
[46:23.500 --> 46:26.580]  all he did was write him an illegal possession of cannabis ticket.
[46:26.820 --> 46:28.980]  And he kind of chewed him out. He's like, you can't fucking smoke here.
[46:29.340 --> 46:31.780]  And my buddy's like, I was just waiting. I didn't have anywhere to be.
[46:31.780 --> 46:33.620]  And he's like, I don't care. You can't fucking smoke here.
[46:34.580 --> 46:36.900]  Like that was our buddy's fault.
[46:37.940 --> 46:40.100]  Yeah, it was 44th fault. Shout out to 44.
[46:40.540 --> 46:44.220]  But if there had been a place for him to go where he could safely consume
[46:44.220 --> 46:45.060]  cannabis,
[46:49.660 --> 46:53.420]  if there had been a place for him to like safely consume cannabis, you know,
[46:53.460 --> 46:56.380]  that wouldn't have happened. That whole situation wouldn't have happened.
[46:56.380 --> 46:58.540]  For most people that wouldn't have happened. But for our friend,
[46:58.540 --> 47:00.780]  44 and two that still would have happened that way.
[47:01.780 --> 47:03.540]  But yeah, I hate situation.
[47:04.300 --> 47:07.980]  There should be more hotels that cater to the level of tourists coming through
[47:07.980 --> 47:12.100]  Colorado. And they just, that part of the industry hasn't caught up yet. Um,
[47:12.140 --> 47:12.980]  and I mean,
[47:13.260 --> 47:17.140]  consumption clubs solve a couple of hundred different questions about how legal
[47:17.140 --> 47:18.100]  marijuana works.
[47:18.180 --> 47:20.140]  There was a dispensary in Manitou Springs.
[47:20.180 --> 47:22.860]  Since the dispensary I work for is not a recreational store.
[47:22.860 --> 47:27.020]  It's a medical only I can tell you about Emerald fields in Manitou Springs.
[47:27.140 --> 47:28.940]  If you're going to be in the Manitou Springs,
[47:28.940 --> 47:32.260]  Colorado Springs area, and you're looking for recreational cannabis,
[47:32.260 --> 47:33.580]  I would send you to Emerald fields.
[47:33.580 --> 47:35.740]  I liked the vibe and the experience of the place.
[47:35.740 --> 47:39.740]  It was unlike any other recreational dispensary I've ever been to.
[47:39.740 --> 47:42.180]  The place was really fucking cool. Had a neat vibe to it.
[47:42.620 --> 47:45.420]  It's a little overpriced because it's recreational cannabis and I'm used to
[47:45.420 --> 47:49.620]  paying a member pricing over at green and healthy, but the place was cool as shit.
[47:49.620 --> 47:51.820]  Check it out. Uh, right down the street,
[47:51.860 --> 47:54.620]  there is a four 20 friendly hotel in Manitou.
[47:54.620 --> 47:56.580]  They advertise that they are four 20 friendly,
[47:56.580 --> 47:57.780]  so they're not going to kick you out.
[47:58.020 --> 48:01.860]  I don't know if you can smoke in the rooms or if they've got like a designated
[48:01.860 --> 48:06.380]  four 20 area, but it advertises four 20 friendly on the sign.
[48:06.460 --> 48:10.140]  It's basically if you're coming to Colorado and you plan to consume cannabis,
[48:10.140 --> 48:13.540]  the best thing you can do is call around to several different hotels and just
[48:13.620 --> 48:17.700]  straight up asking what their marijuana policy is. Don't use euphemisms.
[48:18.700 --> 48:20.180]  Um, don't let there be any confusion.
[48:20.300 --> 48:22.620]  They've gotten this phone call eight times today.
[48:23.020 --> 48:26.300]  The person on the other end should just give you a rote response.
[48:26.420 --> 48:30.380]  If anybody from Emerald fields or that hotel heard any of that,
[48:30.380 --> 48:34.260]  you can kindly send an email with a check in it.
[48:37.300 --> 48:40.540]  Um, but yeah, just call and ask, what's your marijuana policy.
[48:40.540 --> 48:44.780]  They'll tell you that they'll kick you out for consuming on property at a story.
[48:45.260 --> 48:48.300]  Um, they'll tell you that they don't allow you to consume inside,
[48:48.300 --> 48:49.220]  but they have a smoking pad.
[48:49.220 --> 48:53.100]  There is one Pueblo or one hotel on the South side of Pueblo that is cannabis
[48:53.100 --> 48:55.380]  friendly, but I cannot recall which hotel is right now.
[48:55.380 --> 48:57.700]  The one I used to send people to, um,
[48:57.740 --> 49:01.500]  I sent a guy to the other night and I got a call back maybe 45 minutes after I
[49:01.500 --> 49:03.340]  had this conversation and he was like, no,
[49:03.340 --> 49:07.460]  they said they're not anymore and he yelled at me and I had to leave and I felt
[49:07.460 --> 49:10.380]  really bad. Oops. Um, yep. Sorry dude.
[49:11.780 --> 49:14.860]  My bad. But yeah, it, uh, there's just some, um,
[49:14.860 --> 49:18.260]  Colorado's got the best set of laws so far in my opinion,
[49:18.260 --> 49:19.540]  but we've still got some serious,
[49:19.540 --> 49:22.980]  serious holes in our law right now that need to be fixed.
[49:22.980 --> 49:26.380]  There are a couple of classier hotels in Denver. Uh,
[49:26.500 --> 49:30.260]  I don't know if I even want to say the names of the places, but I, if you,
[49:30.340 --> 49:33.940]  we go for the cannabis cup and when we go for the cup, we get expensive hotels.
[49:33.940 --> 49:35.980]  Not to be an asshole. Yeah. When we would go to Denver,
[49:36.340 --> 49:38.460]  we would go get fucking high end hotels.
[49:38.460 --> 49:40.580]  Like we were going to be kind of assholes about it and eat,
[49:40.620 --> 49:44.700]  eat lunch on the balcony and spoil yourself a little bit. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
[49:44.700 --> 49:48.660]  Yeah. And so, uh, if you told the people at the desk, you're like,
[49:48.660 --> 49:51.980]  so what's the, uh, the smoking fee? And they're like, it's $500 here.
[49:52.180 --> 49:55.100]  We're going to be here for three days. There's eight of us thrown out,
[49:55.100 --> 49:57.700]  like 40 bucks each or 50 bucks each. Or what is that? I don't know.
[49:57.700 --> 50:00.020]  I can't do math this quickly while I'm talking about it.
[50:00.180 --> 50:02.540]  But if we divide the wheel, divided the smoking fee,
[50:02.540 --> 50:05.540]  like can you just bill us for that and not fuck with us? And they're like, okay.
[50:06.020 --> 50:08.900]  And they just let us pay the $500 smoking what they were going to charge us.
[50:09.100 --> 50:12.740]  That's three on a paid in advance. Like we're going to smoke this bitch out.
[50:12.780 --> 50:14.660]  And they're like, okay. And they just let us do that.
[50:15.860 --> 50:18.660]  There are other hotels that won't let you smoke them out,
[50:18.660 --> 50:22.940]  but some of, or all of their rooms have balconies. Um,
[50:22.980 --> 50:26.620]  and some of them are more or less lenient with just go out on the balcony and
[50:26.620 --> 50:28.340]  puff. Yeah. Um,
[50:28.420 --> 50:32.700]  others have straight up told people just go to the back of our parking lot. Um,
[50:32.740 --> 50:34.900]  and every time I drive by one of them,
[50:34.900 --> 50:38.180]  I see like three people standing in this parking lot, just in the back corner.
[50:38.180 --> 50:41.220]  So the Warwick has killer balconies.
[50:42.540 --> 50:45.060]  That's all I'm saying. The balcony at the Warwick is rad.
[50:45.180 --> 50:49.940]  There's actually a little smoking club in Denver called I bake or I
[50:49.940 --> 50:53.940]  baked. Yes. I bake. Yes. Um, have you guys ever been, I haven't been,
[50:53.940 --> 50:56.540]  but I've heard a lot of good things, but have not been there. Okay. Um,
[50:56.580 --> 51:00.540]  so I visited Colorado twice before I moved out here and, um,
[51:00.580 --> 51:02.100]  both times that I visited,
[51:02.340 --> 51:07.260]  I tried to go there and like they don't open until noon or something like that.
[51:07.260 --> 51:11.460]  So my overly excited woke up too early, you know?
[51:11.780 --> 51:15.980]  So I was not prepared for something to not be open till noon and I was not ready
[51:15.980 --> 51:20.180]  to wait to smoke a blunt. So I smoked in a parking lot, but anyways, um,
[51:20.380 --> 51:23.540]  but yeah, so I have never actually been there, but apparently, um,
[51:23.580 --> 51:28.540]  that is a really chill, like no entry fee, no nothing place.
[51:28.780 --> 51:32.140]  So if you're ever in Denver and you want to check that place out, that, uh,
[51:32.700 --> 51:35.700]  that's a cannabis smoking club. I bake, you can hit my PayPal.
[51:35.820 --> 51:37.540]  Yeah. That's easy. Um, there's a,
[51:37.740 --> 51:42.540]  there's a bunch of speakeasy style cannabis clubs around Denver and other
[51:42.540 --> 51:46.620]  cities in Colorado. They're just, if they were legal, it'd be simple.
[51:46.820 --> 51:48.820]  You know, I shout out the Cana Canyon all the time.
[51:48.820 --> 51:53.740]  I really had fun at the dab lounge a couple of weekends ago with Steve Dufino
[51:53.740 --> 51:57.220]  doing the veteran farmers Alliance. And then I went to the speakeasy,
[51:57.420 --> 52:00.660]  it's the four 20 speakeasy. It's next door to the lazy lion.
[52:00.940 --> 52:03.420]  It's a completely different vibe than both places.
[52:03.420 --> 52:06.500]  It's got a big stage and there was a band playing and there are pool tables.
[52:07.540 --> 52:08.580]  There are a lot of options.
[52:08.580 --> 52:11.660]  I really enjoyed all three of those clubs on a different level.
[52:11.660 --> 52:15.660]  I just prefer the Cana Canyon because it's got this hardwood floors,
[52:15.680 --> 52:17.700]  leather couches. It's just classy as fuck.
[52:17.900 --> 52:21.300]  It's funny. I always explain the smoking clubs in Colorado Springs.
[52:21.340 --> 52:25.260]  If you're trying to go with people who you're trying to,
[52:25.340 --> 52:26.940]  I wouldn't even say distract. Um,
[52:26.960 --> 52:29.900]  but there's a lot of TVs and a lot of things to do at the lion.
[52:29.900 --> 52:32.940]  So you don't necessarily have to interact with people. Um,
[52:32.940 --> 52:34.340]  the dab lounge is the same way.
[52:34.380 --> 52:34.980]  Right. And,
[52:34.980 --> 52:39.140]  but Cana Canyon is where you go with your like true friends to like sit down and
[52:39.140 --> 52:42.620]  talk and actually have like a real conversation because there really isn't any
[52:42.620 --> 52:44.380]  TVs or some music and stuff.
[52:44.380 --> 52:47.500]  So you really go there for the atmosphere and the cannabis and everything.
[52:47.500 --> 52:49.940]  Music is kept at a real quiet level. And yeah,
[52:50.100 --> 52:53.260]  the hostess is usually Camille and she's amazing.
[52:53.280 --> 52:56.340]  Bring you bottles of water if you coughed too hard. Yeah.
[52:56.980 --> 52:58.780]  Right. And like, that's what I want,
[52:59.380 --> 53:04.380]  what I hope to see like all over Colorado slowly start to spring up is places
[53:04.380 --> 53:07.100]  where people can go with their friends, socialize a little bit,
[53:07.100 --> 53:10.620]  consume some cannabis safely out of public view,
[53:10.620 --> 53:13.300]  like away from people who aren't interested in it. I mean,
[53:13.300 --> 53:16.140]  it's just that simple and it's someplace to wait for the fucking cab or the Uber,
[53:16.220 --> 53:16.460]  you know,
[53:16.460 --> 53:19.540]  where people can safely consume cannabis and hang out with a whole bunch of their
[53:19.540 --> 53:21.660]  friends and meet Adam ill this table,
[53:21.700 --> 53:25.780]  the secret sesh in Denver, Colorado on four 20 hosted by Gatsby gardens.
[53:25.900 --> 53:27.580]  I was supposed to shut that out at the start of the show.
[53:28.380 --> 53:31.780]  You'll be there. I'll be there. I'm working. Michael be working.
[53:32.420 --> 53:35.860]  Someone's got to do it, bro. Yeah. Shout out to the Grammy Gatsby.
[53:35.900 --> 53:37.580]  Thanks for all the love, bro. I appreciate it.
[53:41.660 --> 53:43.340]  We actually just confirmed our DJ.
[53:43.700 --> 53:46.340]  I've been talking about the DJ that we might get. We just confirmed it.
[53:46.340 --> 53:49.940]  So I have to get permission from the people that are hosting the event before I
[53:49.940 --> 53:53.700]  can announce the DJ on the show. We've got it. We've got a good DJ.
[53:54.260 --> 53:58.420]  I asked one of my favorite rappers to come rap and crickets.
[54:00.180 --> 54:03.420]  Not going to happen. Did you get Yoda dabbed again? Oh God,
[54:03.460 --> 54:06.700]  we're not going to go there. Shout out to highly educated titanium.
[54:07.820 --> 54:09.540]  Young lady, you want the show back? I kind of took over.
[54:10.100 --> 54:13.500]  I think we had a couple more questions or did we wrap it up? I don't know.
[54:13.660 --> 54:15.860]  I really think we're right at one hour.
[54:16.020 --> 54:19.300]  I'm in that fine spot between two dabbed and not dabbed.
[54:19.900 --> 54:20.780]  That's usually how I live.
[54:20.780 --> 54:23.420]  I'm either too high for this shit or not high enough for this shit.
[54:23.460 --> 54:26.740]  So honestly the last three questions are what we had talked about,
[54:26.740 --> 54:31.660]  that they're all shows in themselves. So, um, I don't mean,
[54:31.780 --> 54:32.980]  we can do a round two of this.
[54:32.980 --> 54:35.980]  What I think we should do is let the listeners listen to this one.
[54:36.020 --> 54:39.460]  And if you guys have any questions or things that you'd like to follow up on in
[54:39.460 --> 54:40.900]  this, you can send me an email.
[54:40.900 --> 54:43.980]  It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com or you can hit me on Twitter.
[54:44.500 --> 54:47.860]  It's at GFYH podcast where you can go to Facebook and find the grow from your
[54:47.860 --> 54:50.020]  heart podcast, Facebook page. Send me a message on there.
[54:50.020 --> 54:54.380]  I check all of them semi regularly. Uh, so I'll find the message.
[54:54.380 --> 54:57.540]  I will guarantee check it and find it eventually. Uh,
[54:57.540 --> 55:01.180]  and we will do a followup episode with part of the questions that are on the
[55:01.180 --> 55:04.220]  bottom of the page that you guys say can be an entire episode on their own.
[55:04.220 --> 55:07.300]  Maybe we can make one episode out of all three of those plus listen to our
[55:07.300 --> 55:11.140]  comments and we'll bring you guys both back for round two, uh,
[55:11.140 --> 55:15.020]  in two or three weeks or so. Something like that. Absolutely. All right.
[55:15.020 --> 55:19.180]  So maybe like episode one 27 to one 30 ish. These guys will be back.
[55:19.380 --> 55:21.460]  We're going to ballpark it there.
[55:21.980 --> 55:24.620]  You never know what could happen. There could, the shit goes on in my world.
[55:24.620 --> 55:26.140]  This, this podcast, you guys,
[55:26.140 --> 55:29.780]  I had a whole nother show planned and this podcast happened today. So, uh,
[55:29.820 --> 55:33.100]  this was, I love the way my life goes and the way that this podcast happens.
[55:33.100 --> 55:36.380]  I hope you guys love it. It worked out really, really well. I think. Yeah. Yeah.
[55:36.580 --> 55:39.060]  Hey Mike, how can people follow you on social media?
[55:39.220 --> 55:44.260]  Um, you can find me two places, uh, at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter or,
[55:44.260 --> 55:48.020]  um, I run a Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws,
[55:48.020 --> 55:50.700]  Facebook page. Um, hit me up on there.
[55:50.700 --> 55:54.140]  If you're looking for basically any cannabis legalization news,
[55:54.140 --> 55:59.140]  a lot of it's local, but I do nationwide and not worldwide. When it's good news,
[55:59.220 --> 56:01.820]  you can tell he knows a lot of buzzwords and knows his shit when it comes to
[56:01.820 --> 56:03.540]  cannabis legislation nationwide.
[56:04.420 --> 56:08.300]  He really focuses on the state and the local, but he knows his shit all statewide.
[56:08.460 --> 56:11.140]  I'm kind of like a heroin junkie in that fashion.
[56:11.140 --> 56:12.620]  Like when I wake up in the morning,
[56:12.660 --> 56:17.140]  one of the first things I do is hop online and check a couple of different,
[56:17.140 --> 56:22.140]  really good news sources, uh, for what's going on in, in marijuana today.
[56:22.780 --> 56:27.140]  Um, and I have to like, it's a fucking compulsion after all these years when I
[56:27.140 --> 56:29.460]  don't get to do it in the morning, all day at work, I'm like, ah,
[56:29.460 --> 56:33.900]  I get to read the fucking paper. Um, and it's digital now,
[56:33.900 --> 56:35.620]  so I'm not just getting the Denver post.
[56:35.620 --> 56:38.220]  I read like 17 or 18 different newspapers.
[56:38.260 --> 56:42.300]  If you want to classify the amount of news as a paper, um, a day,
[56:42.300 --> 56:45.740]  just following this stuff as a compulsion now. So yeah,
[56:45.740 --> 56:49.660]  I do all the good stuff I share to that Facebook page or, um,
[56:49.700 --> 56:51.220]  some of the stuff gets up on Twitter.
[56:51.540 --> 56:54.340]  Make sure you follow that Facebook page guys and also check them out on Twitter.
[56:54.540 --> 56:59.140]  If you follow Mike on Twitter from this podcast, uh, tag Mike,
[56:59.300 --> 57:03.780]  tag the podcast and tell him I heard about you through the GFYH podcast and let
[57:03.780 --> 57:06.420]  him know. Cause he likes to know where his listeners and followers are coming.
[57:06.460 --> 57:06.820]  Right?
[57:06.820 --> 57:11.780]  Most of my followers follow me because I regularly smack anti-marijuana people
[57:11.820 --> 57:16.980]  on Twitter and that gets you a bunch of really weird follows. Um,
[57:17.100 --> 57:19.340]  and then every day, every now and again at two in the morning,
[57:19.340 --> 57:22.220]  I'll get a bunch of random follows when I haven't been on Twitter in six days
[57:22.220 --> 57:24.700]  and I have to think it's a podcast thing, but I never fucking know.
[57:24.700 --> 57:26.100]  So answer that question for me, please.
[57:26.140 --> 57:29.980]  Yeah. Just be like, Hey Mike, Hey, at Nemo punk, what's the number 15?
[57:30.300 --> 57:31.900]  Yeah. At Nemo punk 15.
[57:31.900 --> 57:35.660]  At Nemo punk 15 we found you on the, and then at GFYH podcast.
[57:35.900 --> 57:36.580]  We found you there.
[57:36.580 --> 57:39.260]  From the pod. If you don't want to do it in a tweet, you can do it in a message.
[57:39.660 --> 57:43.460]  Yeah. Whatever you prefer. All right, dude. Thanks for coming.
[57:43.660 --> 57:47.100]  Happy to man. Shout out to the wife and kid. Yeah. Shout out babies. Yeah.
[57:47.220 --> 57:48.860]  All right. Miss traveling stoner. Yes.
[57:48.900 --> 57:50.620]  How can people follow you on the social media?
[57:50.900 --> 57:55.900]  So Instagram and Periscope are the same. It's the traveling stoner.
[57:56.900 --> 58:01.900]  My Twitter is traveling stoner and then my Snapchat is traveling stoner without
[58:02.620 --> 58:03.460]  the G.
[58:03.460 --> 58:07.380]  So someone went and snatched up all of the traveling stoner on a certain amount
[58:07.420 --> 58:11.540]  of a social media sites that I didn't. Yeah. So anyways,
[58:12.460 --> 58:14.740]  so yeah, so it's all over the place, but those are them.
[58:14.820 --> 58:17.620]  And a blog intern for Miss Mary Jane Co. Yes.
[58:17.620 --> 58:21.020]  Shout out to Miss Mary Jane Co. Thanks for giving my girl a shot.
[58:21.380 --> 58:26.180]  Yeah. It's it's missmaryjaneco.wordpress.com.
[58:26.540 --> 58:27.620]  So be sure to check it out.
[58:27.620 --> 58:31.700]  It has a lot of information about what they do as a company and it has some
[58:31.700 --> 58:33.100]  information too about cannabis.
[58:34.180 --> 58:35.900]  Make sure you check it out. You guys also big shout out to,
[58:36.060 --> 58:38.460]  we're going to give a shout out to your, your finer other half,
[58:38.860 --> 58:43.220]  your better half. Yes, absolutely. The other ganja girl. Yes.
[58:43.300 --> 58:45.940]  Oh, we should explain. So she posted a picture to Instagram.
[58:47.740 --> 58:49.660]  Her and I saw that on Instagram. It was hilarious.
[58:49.660 --> 58:52.580]  Her and Bobo Blastico are on a hike and they post a picture and she tags it.
[58:52.580 --> 58:53.420]  Ganja girls.
[58:54.780 --> 58:58.180]  It's a really popular hashtag. And so I mean,
[58:58.260 --> 59:00.060]  he's the sexiest ganja girl of all bro.
[59:00.060 --> 59:03.540]  He's got a beard like and a mustache. He is appealing.
[59:03.860 --> 59:06.940]  So one of my girlfriends called it out and she was like, Oh my God,
[59:06.940 --> 59:10.060]  what cute ganja girls. And then she immediately wrote like, Oh my God,
[59:10.060 --> 59:12.580]  I'm so sorry. Like I, I sometimes I get really high.
[59:12.580 --> 59:14.340]  I think I'm funny on the internet. I'm really sorry.
[59:14.340 --> 59:17.500]  That shit is truly funny. Was it? Was that LOL Chanel?
[59:17.500 --> 59:18.780]  Yeah. Shout out to LOL Chanel.
[59:19.020 --> 59:22.580]  That was truly funny. Don't apologize for that. Bobo, what's up?
[59:22.580 --> 59:26.300]  You're my favorite ganja girl. You could easily be a 420 nurse.
[59:27.460 --> 59:28.300]  Absolutely.
[59:28.740 --> 59:30.740]  Oh, that wasn't a visual. I needed a behold.
[59:31.620 --> 59:32.060]  I've all,
[59:32.060 --> 59:35.780]  I've only seen one photo and I took that photo and I just threw the fucking
[59:35.780 --> 59:36.620]  ganja nurse.
[59:36.620 --> 59:38.900]  Now you know who Bobo Blastico is and now you're imagining,
[59:38.940 --> 59:40.060]  imagining him as a 420 nurse.
[59:40.060 --> 59:42.540]  All that fur and those little green crosses.
[59:42.580 --> 59:45.300]  Leaning over giving you a dab with his little nurse hat on.
[59:46.740 --> 59:49.500]  Shout out bro. Also shout out to Sloppy for the, uh,
[59:49.500 --> 59:53.140]  the man sized dab that he tried to take with me yesterday. That was epic.
[59:53.420 --> 59:56.020]  Epic, epic. And also, uh, we're going to do the shout outs here, but big,
[59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.300]  big huge shout out and a fat hug to my friend, Maddie. All right. So, uh,
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:03.700]  we kind of interrupted you on all your social media stuff. That's good.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:08.060]  That was Miss Mary Jane co. Yeah. Uh, that's pretty much it for right now.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:10.580]  All right. Well, thank you for coming. Thank you. Thank you for having me.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.260]  I really appreciate you taking some time away from the house and coming and
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:17.700]  hanging out. So fun. Shout out to Scooby the dog. Yes.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.180]  That's a cool little dog. You gotta bring him next time. So you can like,
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:22.980]  like bark in the background, like waddles around the house.
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:25.380]  He's like got a funny shape to him. His legs are too short.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.100]  He's a great little dog. She's pulling up pictures for Mike.
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.300]  He's a cool little dog. I want to thank you guys both for coming.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.380]  I want to thank everybody for listening to the show. You guys,
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:35.540]  you know I will be back in another week with another episode. Um,
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.020]  our friend Kabuki J Fox was messaging me.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.820]  He was going to try to get over here for the podcast,
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:42.060]  but he had a lot going on and we took forever. Uh,
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:44.700]  Kabuki will be in Pueblo much more frequently.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.900]  He just got involved in a project here in Pueblo.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.580]  So we're going to have run CBD here in the, uh,
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:53.580]  I'm way pumped about that kitchen slash studio slash dining room.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:54.820]  We'll get Kabuki over here.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:58.380]  We'll take some CBD dabs and talk about Terps for tots and stuff like that.
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.780]  It's the best bucket hashtag ever.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.140]  I just, I spattered it out one day at the, uh,
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.060]  the event for the veteran farmers Alliance. All right, guys,
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.980]  the podcast is officially over. I would like it. If you go to iTunes,
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.180]  go to the iTunes store, search for the grow from your heart podcast,
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.900]  find the review section. Give me a five star rate, five star rating.
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.020]  Just do it please. What happens when you do that?
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:19.340]  That moves us up in the rankings. God, I stuttered when I said rankings.
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.180]  That was weird. Why is it such a hard word?
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.700]  I moves us up in the rankings. More people will see us.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.420]  The more people that see the podcast means more people will listen,
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:30.500]  which means more people will be growing much better quality cannabis.
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.820]  It'll make better cannabis available for the world.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.940]  We will overgrow the government one click at a time.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.380]  I think I just made up a new slogan on accident, but you guys seriously,
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.300]  give me a five star rating. Type in a little comment.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.500]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:46.460]  I will read your review on a future podcast. Um,
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:49.260]  if you don't want to do a review, you can send me an email,
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:52.300]  grow from your heart at hotmail.com. I've talked about the Twitter feed. Uh,
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:56.020]  it's at GFYH podcast. And of course the Facebook, don't forget you guys,
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:58.260]  the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher,
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.220]  and most of the episodes are archived on I read genetics, colorado.com.
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:05.700]  When some of those key episodes go away, I will put them back up into the feed.
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.580]  iTunes only holds about a hundred episodes.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.220]  The website may only hold a hundred episodes of what I'm learning.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:13.220]  So I will go back and when it, when it takes down the important shit,
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:17.820]  I'll put it back up anyway. Um, yeah, they took down the PayPal button.
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.740]  What's up with that? We don't have a PayPal account anymore. That's bullshit.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.700]  Anyway, you guys, I want to thank you guys for listening.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.940]  Follow the new I read genetics, Instagram account.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.700]  It's I read underscore genetics. That's all I've got for you this week.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:31.540]  And until next time, take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.540]  Well, listen, right. Just make your parents on them up.
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.420]  Well if we did them come back on the course, I go suck us.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.700]  Then I put another for you upon them.

[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:34.580]  it.
