[00:15.480 --> 00:18.240]  Welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[00:18.240 --> 00:21.440]  It's time for episode number 270 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.780 --> 00:24.860]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[00:25.520 --> 00:27.740]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.860 --> 00:31.400]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist
[00:31.480 --> 00:34.420]  or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.740 --> 00:36.920]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.700 --> 00:39.620]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.620 --> 00:41.460]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.460 --> 00:44.220]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends
[00:44.240 --> 00:47.260]  in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.660 --> 00:51.960]  Big thanks to Kat, Ku and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.760 --> 00:55.880]  Thanks again for joining me, everybody.
[00:55.880 --> 00:58.560]  I hope you're having a great evening, daytime, nighttime, whatever time it is,
[00:58.560 --> 00:59.560]  wherever you are.
[00:59.560 --> 01:00.300]  Hope you're having a great one.
[01:00.300 --> 01:02.520]  I hope you're smoking on something delicious.
[01:02.520 --> 01:03.760]  Maybe you got a fat joint rolled up.
[01:03.760 --> 01:05.320]  Maybe you're taking a fat dab.
[01:05.320 --> 01:08.320]  I just took a giant dab of some Tahoe OG batter
[01:08.560 --> 01:10.980]  mixed with Pura Vida OG batter.
[01:10.980 --> 01:12.780]  The Tahoe OG tastes amazing, you guys,
[01:12.800 --> 01:15.480]  but it just doesn't give me the high that I want.
[01:15.480 --> 01:16.240]  It's kind of mellow.
[01:16.240 --> 01:19.380]  It kind of chills me out, which is cool, but I want a little more from it,
[01:19.380 --> 01:20.480]  but the taste is amazing.
[01:20.480 --> 01:24.560]  So I've been mixing the Tahoe OG with the Pura Vida and taking good sized dabs
[01:24.560 --> 01:26.640]  of that. The Pura Vida makes me forget where I am.
[01:26.960 --> 01:28.360]  It makes me forget what I'm doing.
[01:28.360 --> 01:31.960]  So mixing the Pura Vida and the Tahoe, it's a super turpy combo,
[01:31.980 --> 01:35.160]  super great head high, super nice body high. I'm nice and chilled out.
[01:35.160 --> 01:37.120]  I'm ready to do a great podcast. Anyway,
[01:37.120 --> 01:39.840]  I hope you're smoking on something delicious. All right,
[01:39.960 --> 01:42.080]  let's start off this podcast by jumping right into it. You guys,
[01:42.220 --> 01:45.100]  I've got a brand new iTunes comment. It's a,
[01:45.300 --> 01:47.340]  it's a rating and a review is what it is here on iTunes.
[01:47.340 --> 01:49.660]  I would love it if you guys would leave me some ratings and reviews.
[01:49.680 --> 01:52.740]  The way you can do so is go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[01:53.240 --> 01:56.060]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast, scroll down about halfway.
[01:56.120 --> 01:59.180]  You'll see a picture. It's a red, yellow, and green flag with my face on it.
[01:59.420 --> 02:01.820]  It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo. Click right on there.
[02:02.140 --> 02:03.820]  That will take you to the podcast page.
[02:03.860 --> 02:06.980]  In the middle of that page is a spot where it says ratings and reviews.
[02:07.580 --> 02:10.620]  That is where you are able to leave me a rating and a review. So far,
[02:10.620 --> 02:12.640]  everybody has left a five star review.
[02:12.920 --> 02:15.520]  And also let me scroll up to the top and make sure I'm not lying to you because
[02:15.520 --> 02:19.280]  there was one, you know what they took down. Nope. There is one four star review.
[02:19.800 --> 02:23.680]  I have got 77 ratings. 76 of them are five stars.
[02:23.700 --> 02:25.600]  One is a four star rating. Anyway,
[02:26.200 --> 02:29.040]  leave me the amount of stars that you feel I deserve and type in a little
[02:29.040 --> 02:32.760]  customer review and I will read your customer review on a future episode.
[02:33.300 --> 02:36.640]  Let's get into reading the most recent. This one came in on November 29th.
[02:36.640 --> 02:39.960]  It's from a person who calls themselves Farmer Dan 831.
[02:40.180 --> 02:45.140]  The headline of the customer review goes like this best info you can find.
[02:45.580 --> 02:49.180]  And then this is what Farmer Dan 831 had to say. Love your show.
[02:49.200 --> 02:52.060]  Rasta Jeff got the whole crew hooked on your show.
[02:52.080 --> 02:55.140]  We're listening to you as we harvest one of our rooms for live resin.
[02:55.460 --> 02:59.220]  Keep it real, man. Good vibes your way. Hey Farmer Dan, thanks for listening.
[02:59.500 --> 03:02.760]  Thanks for getting the whole crew addicted to the podcast. And also, man,
[03:02.760 --> 03:04.380]  thanks for putting some live resin out there.
[03:04.620 --> 03:07.140]  I kind of want to know where you work. Who do you work for? Uh,
[03:07.160 --> 03:09.960]  what company are you making live resin for? And can I try it?
[03:10.240 --> 03:14.160]  I'd like to go pick up a gram somewhere and see what you are making. All right.
[03:14.160 --> 03:16.720]  That's the only iTunes comment I have got for now. Uh,
[03:16.740 --> 03:19.200]  feel free to leave me more iTunes ratings and reviews.
[03:19.200 --> 03:20.880]  I would truly appreciate that.
[03:21.480 --> 03:24.640]  And also I want to give a huge thanks to all of the people who have left iTunes
[03:24.660 --> 03:28.800]  ratings and customer reviews in the past. Thanks everybody. I appreciate that.
[03:29.560 --> 03:31.880]  All right, let's work our way into another topic. You guys,
[03:32.120 --> 03:36.640]  this is a little bit, uh, not cannabis related, but it is internet related.
[03:36.820 --> 03:39.580]  And since my podcast is an internet based show,
[03:39.780 --> 03:43.660]  I feel that this topic may or may not affect you and or I in the future.
[03:43.940 --> 03:48.860]  And I kind of wanted to bring it up on the podcast. So today the FCC officially,
[03:49.020 --> 03:52.380]  uh, they repealed net neutrality rules.
[03:52.620 --> 03:55.060]  Now let me explain a little bit about what net neutrality is.
[03:55.080 --> 03:58.420]  And I'm just going to read basically from Wikipedia and tell you what Wikipedia
[03:58.440 --> 04:02.060]  says about net neutrality. And then we'll talk a little bit about it. It says,
[04:02.080 --> 04:05.560]  net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers must treat all
[04:05.580 --> 04:09.660]  data on the internet the same and not discriminate or charge differently by user
[04:09.680 --> 04:12.260]  content, website, platform, application,
[04:12.260 --> 04:15.540]  type of attached equipment or method of communication. For instance,
[04:15.620 --> 04:19.580]  instance under these principles, internet service providers are unable to
[04:19.580 --> 04:21.540]  intentionally block, slow down,
[04:21.560 --> 04:24.820]  or charge money for specific websites and online content.
[04:25.260 --> 04:28.000]  Going to skip a little bit. And then here's another part that's important for us.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.560]  It says a widely cited example of a violation of net neutrality principles was
[04:32.560 --> 04:36.700]  the internet service provider Comcast secret slowing of uploads from peer to
[04:36.700 --> 04:40.420]  peer file sharing applications by using forged packets.
[04:41.580 --> 04:46.020]  Comcast did not stop blocking these protocols like BitTorrent until the federal
[04:46.040 --> 04:49.620]  communications commission ordered them to stop. And another minor example,
[04:49.740 --> 04:54.500]  the Madison river communications company was fined $15,000 by the FCC in
[04:54.500 --> 04:57.940]  2004 for restricting their customers access to Vonage,
[04:57.940 --> 05:00.940]  which was rivaling their own services. So basically you guys,
[05:01.120 --> 05:02.280]  what net neutrality did,
[05:02.760 --> 05:07.720]  what net neutrality did was made it illegal for folks like Comcast,
[05:07.740 --> 05:09.320]  AT&T, Verizon,
[05:09.340 --> 05:13.680]  or whoever else you can think of to alter their internet service based on your
[05:13.680 --> 05:16.240]  usage or their preferences. Right now,
[05:16.540 --> 05:19.920]  if you live in the United States of America and you are not in an institution
[05:19.920 --> 05:22.800]  and you have public internet, your internet is wide open.
[05:22.820 --> 05:26.200]  You are able to look at whatever you would like. You can look at AOL,
[05:26.200 --> 05:29.120]  you can look at Disney, you can look at animal planet,
[05:29.140 --> 05:32.660]  but also you can go to hightimes.com and look at cannabis.
[05:32.900 --> 05:36.620]  You can go to your favorite adult website and look at whatever you're into there.
[05:36.860 --> 05:39.300]  You can do whatever you want on the internet right now.
[05:39.540 --> 05:41.260]  When net neutrality becomes a thing,
[05:41.540 --> 05:46.020]  your internet service provider will get to decide what you may or may not look
[05:46.020 --> 05:49.020]  at. They may decide that if you want the adult package, if you,
[05:49.060 --> 05:52.280]  if your content is considered adult, if you're looking at cannabis,
[05:52.280 --> 05:54.060]  if you're looking at adult themed things,
[05:54.380 --> 05:57.100]  if you're looking at anything they feel may be adult,
[05:57.280 --> 06:00.320]  they can put a surcharge on that for you and charge you money. Right now,
[06:00.340 --> 06:04.480]  it's currently illegal, but now that the restrictions have been lifted,
[06:04.540 --> 06:07.920]  they are going to be allowed to do this once all of these rules and laws are
[06:07.920 --> 06:09.160]  worked out. Now,
[06:09.160 --> 06:12.440]  what concerns me is I like giving you guys a free podcast.
[06:12.440 --> 06:14.080]  I like getting my show out.
[06:15.240 --> 06:17.960]  Is it going to cost me more money to upload my show?
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.840]  Because they have mentioned people that use large uploads are going to possibly
[06:21.860 --> 06:23.880]  have to pay for more, more for their internet.
[06:24.100 --> 06:27.500]  They say that people that download large files may have to pay more for their
[06:27.520 --> 06:31.940]  internet. Is your internet service provider going to give you podcasts for free?
[06:32.140 --> 06:35.620]  Is my internet service provider going to allow me to upload these podcasts with
[06:35.620 --> 06:36.540]  no extra charge?
[06:37.100 --> 06:40.140]  Those are all things we're going to have to face here in the future and figure
[06:40.140 --> 06:43.860]  out what the changing of net neutrality. Now,
[06:43.860 --> 06:46.260]  I'm sure a lot of companies will rally and try to sue,
[06:46.340 --> 06:50.340]  and hopefully somebody has a really good lawyer and they can start a lawsuit to
[06:50.360 --> 06:52.420]  stop net neutrality from being lifted.
[06:52.720 --> 06:56.440]  But in other countries like Canada and Chile and Brazil,
[06:56.720 --> 07:01.120]  it's a thing and we all know that North Korea and China are already limiting
[07:01.120 --> 07:03.400]  their internet. You can only see a few websites there.
[07:03.560 --> 07:06.960]  You can't access all the popular stuff there. And if you're caught accessing it,
[07:06.960 --> 07:09.320]  you are committing a crime and you will be punished.
[07:09.400 --> 07:14.000]  So learn what you can from the internet right now. You guys get what you can,
[07:14.020 --> 07:17.480]  because things are changing. I don't know what's coming.
[07:17.500 --> 07:20.400]  People can't predict what's coming because this is a brand new thing,
[07:20.940 --> 07:23.980]  but things are going to change. You know,
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.940]  most of the articles I read said that it was going to be a couple of weeks
[07:26.960 --> 07:31.700]  before the changes roll out. So I hope we don't see too drastic of a change.
[07:31.720 --> 07:34.380]  I hope we don't end up paying for simple internet,
[07:34.400 --> 07:37.260]  paying more for basic internet. We're already paying for internet service.
[07:37.620 --> 07:41.020]  I don't want to have to pay. Imagine if they made it like a cable package. Okay,
[07:41.020 --> 07:43.380]  you can get basic internet. You can check out Facebook,
[07:43.740 --> 07:46.020]  you can check out animal planet, you can check out all that.
[07:46.300 --> 07:48.380]  But if you want to go on the premium package,
[07:48.400 --> 07:50.080]  it's going to be an extra nine 95 a month.
[07:51.200 --> 07:54.480]  Imagine if they start doing that shit to you and then you're not going to know
[07:54.860 --> 07:57.680]  what you're not getting until you're not able to get it.
[07:57.680 --> 07:59.360]  And then you're going to have to add that to your package.
[08:00.160 --> 08:03.560]  How weird would it be to not have access to the whole internet and not even know
[08:03.560 --> 08:07.240]  it because you don't know that that's there because you can't even go to it.
[08:07.520 --> 08:10.640]  Now imagine if you had Comcast, is it okay? Let's even go better.
[08:10.640 --> 08:12.680]  Imagine if you had AT&T as a service provider.
[08:13.280 --> 08:16.880]  So AT&T is who you pay your bill to AT&T is who your service is through.
[08:17.100 --> 08:19.460]  They are the ones that get to decide what you get to see.
[08:19.820 --> 08:23.540]  Now perhaps there's something really cool going on that is sponsored by Verizon.
[08:23.580 --> 08:27.380]  Your favorite band is doing a cool ass show. They're doing it live feed,
[08:27.680 --> 08:31.140]  but it's sponsored by Verizon. Guess what? Fuck you AT&T listeners.
[08:31.300 --> 08:33.740]  You don't get to watch it because you're on a different internet and we're not
[08:33.740 --> 08:37.260]  even going to allow you to see the Verizon shit. So fuck you.
[08:37.520 --> 08:39.980]  That's how it's going to be. People are going to be left out of stuff.
[08:39.980 --> 08:41.500]  You're not going to be able to get to see things.
[08:41.900 --> 08:45.140]  Your friend with a with an iPhone and your other friend with an Android,
[08:45.360 --> 08:47.000]  you're going to have different internets.
[08:47.180 --> 08:49.080]  So you're not going to be able to see the same stuff.
[08:50.680 --> 08:53.560]  Imagine this, and this is just my small mind thinking this.
[08:53.560 --> 08:57.200]  I'm not a capitalist business person, but imagine when you go to a concert,
[08:57.200 --> 08:59.640]  if you go to the Verizon wireless center,
[08:59.880 --> 09:03.140]  the only internet that's going to work there will be Verizon internet.
[09:03.400 --> 09:07.560]  All the ads, anything from AT&T, Comcast, uh, cricket,
[09:07.920 --> 09:10.720]  whatever else phone companies are, I don't even know. Uh,
[09:10.720 --> 09:13.040]  all those other ads will be blocked.
[09:13.220 --> 09:16.820]  Everything will just be Verizon wireless approved content.
[09:17.380 --> 09:21.140]  So even, and then if you go to the AT&T or the Qualcomm center,
[09:21.220 --> 09:23.120]  everything's going to be filtered by them.
[09:23.120 --> 09:26.860]  The internet you're allowed to use on your phone while you were in the Verizon
[09:26.860 --> 09:29.580]  wireless center will be filtered. Even though you are an adult,
[09:30.180 --> 09:31.340]  I'm sure they will filter it.
[09:31.340 --> 09:36.340]  That way nobody can be looking at any adult shit or any band shit or
[09:36.340 --> 09:40.900]  something from a rivaling entity while you're in their facility.
[09:41.400 --> 09:43.960]  That's what this is going to do. This is just the start.
[09:44.200 --> 09:47.280]  I've got a very narrow mind when it comes to capitalizing on stuff like this.
[09:47.280 --> 09:51.440]  I can only imagine what some folks in some suits and some ivory towers with a
[09:51.440 --> 09:54.800]  bunch of money are trying to do to fuck us over a little bit more right now.
[09:55.480 --> 09:59.960]  So the internet may change you guys. Uh, I didn't grow up with the internet.
[09:59.960 --> 10:04.240]  So to see the internet happen, when you first heard about it, you're like, wait,
[10:04.240 --> 10:05.280]  you could put your computer,
[10:05.800 --> 10:08.280]  you plug a phone line into your computer and talk to other people on other
[10:08.280 --> 10:11.540]  computers. Sounds kind of weird, but sounds kind of fun also.
[10:11.540 --> 10:13.500]  But also at the same time I was like, I've got a phone.
[10:13.500 --> 10:15.020]  Why do I want to type out a bunch of shit?
[10:15.020 --> 10:15.380]  And they're like,
[10:15.380 --> 10:18.620]  because you can go in a chat room and talk to like 15 different people at once
[10:18.620 --> 10:22.080]  and learn a bunch of cool shit. Whoa. And I was like, Oh no, the internet.
[10:22.440 --> 10:26.420]  And then the internet went from just like simple chat rooms to like everybody
[10:26.420 --> 10:30.420]  had a website and then it got interactive and then social media happened.
[10:30.780 --> 10:33.900]  Uh, social media wasn't a thing when I was a kid, you guys, all you youngsters,
[10:34.100 --> 10:36.540]  it wasn't a real thing. I feel like grandpa telling stories right now,
[10:36.800 --> 10:40.440]  but social media wasn't a thing when I was young. If you wanted to find friends,
[10:40.480 --> 10:42.960]  you had to fucking go somewhere. If you wanted to know what your neighbor was
[10:42.960 --> 10:45.000]  doing, you had to go there and knock on the fucking door and find out what he
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.340]  was doing. If you wanted to know what your best friend was doing,
[10:47.340 --> 10:49.040]  you had to call him and go, Hey Chris, what are you doing, bro?
[10:49.520 --> 10:52.760]  Like you didn't just jump on Facebook and see what everybody was fucking
[10:52.760 --> 10:56.280]  bitching about all at once. It was way different. So I saw no internet.
[10:56.600 --> 11:00.240]  I saw chat rooms. I saw all of the companies get a website.
[11:00.240 --> 11:01.760]  And I saw everybody's websites suck.
[11:01.760 --> 11:04.440]  And then I saw everybody not have a compatible website.
[11:04.740 --> 11:06.300]  And then I saw websites get good.
[11:06.780 --> 11:10.540]  And then I saw everybody start openly talking about internet porn.
[11:10.540 --> 11:14.300]  It just became a thing. And then internet porn lost. It's funny. And it's stigma.
[11:14.340 --> 11:17.140]  Now everybody just talks about internet porn. Like it's just common.
[11:17.140 --> 11:20.060]  Now it went from like, Ooh, internet porn to now it's just internet porn.
[11:20.820 --> 11:23.220]  Then it went to all the social media got crazy.
[11:23.380 --> 11:27.140]  Then everybody had a YouTube channel and then the internet became what it is
[11:27.180 --> 11:30.380]  today. Uh, if you want to know something, if you have an idea, it's on the
[11:30.400 --> 11:32.220]  internet. If you want to watch a video about something,
[11:32.240 --> 11:34.960]  if you want to see somebody do something, if you want to learn about something,
[11:35.280 --> 11:36.480]  it's on the internet, all of it.
[11:37.260 --> 11:40.200]  And one of the best parts about it was there was no limit because there was no
[11:40.200 --> 11:40.920]  rules.
[11:40.920 --> 11:44.520]  So you could learn about things that you should probably not be learning about,
[11:44.600 --> 11:45.600]  but you're going to do it anyway.
[11:45.620 --> 11:48.320]  So it's best to learn it the best you can so you don't fuck up.
[11:48.600 --> 11:51.160]  But now you won't be able to find all those cool things.
[11:51.160 --> 11:52.920]  You won't be able to watch all that creepy shit.
[11:52.960 --> 11:56.160]  You may have to pay for a different package, but I saw it.
[11:56.280 --> 12:00.200]  I saw it when it was some creepy dark thing that had no rules.
[12:00.860 --> 12:04.620]  I remember overgrow the gov and a whole bunch of other cannabis related websites
[12:04.620 --> 12:08.020]  where we used to all go tell secrets and trade seeds and try to impress each
[12:08.020 --> 12:11.260]  other with our bud shots before it was safe to just go post your entire grow
[12:11.260 --> 12:14.860]  room up on Facebook and Instagram. I remember it. Ladies and gentlemen,
[12:14.860 --> 12:17.260]  the internet will forever be different. Now as a podcaster,
[12:17.940 --> 12:22.740]  it's my duty to do my best to make sure that my podcast is available in as many
[12:22.740 --> 12:24.740]  ways as possible, as many places as possible,
[12:24.740 --> 12:28.260]  as many formats as possible in case something does happen to where people are
[12:28.260 --> 12:29.180]  forced to pay for it.
[12:29.440 --> 12:32.720]  I want you to be able to access my podcast for free.
[12:32.960 --> 12:34.600]  So I'm going to try to stay on top of that.
[12:35.040 --> 12:37.800]  I don't know what's going on with net neutrality more than what I've told you.
[12:38.040 --> 12:39.800]  It's a lot of stuff to take in.
[12:40.320 --> 12:44.520]  If something does happen where you are not able to listen to my podcast for free,
[12:44.840 --> 12:47.040]  send me a message and we will figure something out.
[12:47.040 --> 12:49.880]  If I've got to send you the file, we'll do that.
[12:49.880 --> 12:52.200]  I want everyone to be able to listen to this podcast for free.
[12:52.200 --> 12:55.640]  I will figure out a way to get this show out to everybody.
[12:56.160 --> 12:58.960]  That's my commitment to you guys. I love podcasting. I love cannabis.
[12:58.960 --> 12:59.820]  I love my friends.
[13:00.060 --> 13:03.980]  I love helping my friends grow better cannabis through podcasting.
[13:04.180 --> 13:06.820]  So I'm going to keep at it. I'm going to make sure you guys are able to listen.
[13:07.780 --> 13:11.500]  There's always a way around some Babylon bullshit rules and I'll make sure my
[13:11.500 --> 13:12.980]  friends get to hear the podcast. All right.
[13:13.380 --> 13:15.780]  I feel like I've been talking about net neutrality for a long time.
[13:15.940 --> 13:19.060]  I'd like to hear your comments. I'd like your input. Send me an email.
[13:19.100 --> 13:24.100]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com or send me a tweet at GFYHpodcast
[13:24.180 --> 13:26.620]  on the tweeters. All right, let's move forward a little bit.
[13:26.840 --> 13:27.600]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[13:27.600 --> 13:32.400]  we are in the era of cannabis legalization and medical marijuana and recreational
[13:32.400 --> 13:33.240]  marijuana.
[13:33.520 --> 13:36.960]  But just because we have rules that allow us to dispense,
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.360]  consume and medicate and recreate and all of the above with cannabis does not
[13:41.360 --> 13:44.400]  mean that we can ignore the rules. The rules were made,
[13:44.600 --> 13:47.360]  the rules are in place and we have to follow the rules.
[13:47.360 --> 13:49.440]  I want to read an article that I found on the cannabis.
[13:49.480 --> 13:53.440]  This has been the talk of Colorado today. One of the most popular,
[13:53.700 --> 13:54.660]  can't say most popular,
[13:54.660 --> 13:59.340]  a very well known chain of dispensaries was raided this morning and eight
[13:59.340 --> 14:04.340]  locations were raided and 11 Denver area Sweet Leaf stores were closed and 26 of
[14:06.180 --> 14:10.020]  their licenses have been suspended. I wanted to tell you guys about it.
[14:10.040 --> 14:12.980]  I found the article well written on the cannabis.
[14:13.020 --> 14:17.100]  It is written by Alicia Wallace from the cannabis staff.
[14:17.580 --> 14:19.580]  I'm going to read the whole article. It goes like this.
[14:19.580 --> 14:23.360]  Police raid eight Sweet Leaf marijuana center locations in Denver and Aurora.
[14:23.360 --> 14:28.360]  All 11 Denver area Sweet Leaf stores are closed and it's 26 licenses have been
[14:28.640 --> 14:29.640]  suspended.
[14:29.920 --> 14:34.200]  Denver police on Thursday raided eight Sweet Leaf marijuana center locations in
[14:34.200 --> 14:38.920]  Denver and Aurora and arrested 12 people as part of a year long investigation
[14:38.920 --> 14:41.760]  into illegal marijuana sales. Yes,
[14:41.780 --> 14:45.960]  this dispensary was participating in allegedly, I have to say, allegedly,
[14:45.960 --> 14:48.760]  I'm not a lawyer. I wasn't there. I'm not part of the investigation.
[14:48.760 --> 14:50.300]  I can't prove shit. Allegedly,
[14:50.500 --> 14:53.420]  this dispensary was illegally selling cannabis,
[14:53.680 --> 14:55.500]  which could include a lot of things.
[14:55.580 --> 14:57.700]  If the article doesn't tell us what they may have been doing,
[14:57.740 --> 15:00.100]  I will let you guys know what I feel like may have been happening.
[15:00.460 --> 15:01.180]  It goes like this.
[15:01.180 --> 15:06.100]  The criminal activities alleged include sale of cannabis in violation of the one
[15:06.100 --> 15:09.780]  ounce per person per day limits established under Colorado marijuana law.
[15:10.060 --> 15:13.140]  Denver police officials said in a statement. All right,
[15:13.140 --> 15:18.140]  so in Colorado a recreational cannabis shopper is allowed to buy one ounce per
[15:18.400 --> 15:21.160]  person per day. Now,
[15:21.600 --> 15:24.560]  I did not know that it said per day because there are some dispensaries that
[15:24.560 --> 15:25.960]  will let you come back later.
[15:27.440 --> 15:30.440]  Obviously Sweet Leaf was letting too many people do that and they've gotten
[15:30.440 --> 15:32.640]  themselves in trouble. So I'm going to say it right here.
[15:32.840 --> 15:35.960]  If you work for a dispensary, it says clearly right here,
[15:35.960 --> 15:39.440]  one ounce per person per day. I don't know that Ricardo or let's see,
[15:39.440 --> 15:40.400]  who wrote this article again?
[15:40.400 --> 15:44.360]  I don't know that Alicia Wallace knows all of the laws and rules on cannabis,
[15:44.780 --> 15:47.120]  but it looks like that's what got this place in trouble.
[15:47.120 --> 15:51.100]  So if your dispensary is selling, is letting a customer shop,
[15:51.340 --> 15:54.740]  drive to another dispensary and then come back to your store or visit within the
[15:54.740 --> 15:57.820]  same day, you were breaking the rules. You're going to get in trouble.
[15:57.980 --> 15:59.340]  Check with your compliance officer,
[15:59.360 --> 16:02.060]  check with your management and see if this is a practice that should not be
[16:02.080 --> 16:06.080]  happening in your store. And if it is, you may want to consider cutting that off.
[16:06.780 --> 16:09.780]  I've seen it done. I'm not going to call out any dispensaries that have done it.
[16:10.420 --> 16:13.540]  But there are several recreational dispensaries that will allow you to come
[16:13.540 --> 16:17.000]  back multiple times in the day. And we're not going to do that anymore.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.280]  You guys stop that one visit per day. Otherwise it looks sketchy.
[16:20.400 --> 16:23.200]  There are rules in place. These people are getting trouble for breaking them.
[16:23.480 --> 16:25.440]  So you're allowed to buy one ounce per person per day.
[16:25.680 --> 16:30.680]  And now the criminal activities allege that these folks were violating that rule.
[16:31.440 --> 16:35.120]  The Denver police department of excise and license in concert with the police
[16:35.200 --> 16:39.720]  action suspended 26 licenses for medical retail cultivation and extraction
[16:39.720 --> 16:42.300]  operations. They conduct business as sweet leave,
[16:42.300 --> 16:46.140]  said Dan Roland spokesman for the excise and license department.
[16:46.540 --> 16:50.700]  The suspension order stated reasonable grounds and probable cause exists to
[16:50.700 --> 16:54.500]  believe that respondents have engaged in deliberate and willful violations of
[16:54.500 --> 16:57.580]  state and local laws or regulations and, and,
[16:57.580 --> 17:02.100]  or that the public health safety and welfare requires emergency action.
[17:02.620 --> 17:04.380]  At this point in the articles, I'm scrolling through,
[17:04.380 --> 17:07.620]  there's a picture of the door at sweet leaf with a nice little handwritten note
[17:07.640 --> 17:11.880]  that says, sorry, we are closed. And then a very well printed letter from,
[17:11.920 --> 17:13.160]  it's hard to read because it's kind of small.
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.400]  It says city and County of Denver department of excise and taxes with the big
[17:17.400 --> 17:20.520]  Denver official logo notice of suspension and bright red.
[17:21.360 --> 17:22.800]  And then the following text is in black.
[17:22.800 --> 17:26.760]  It says medical and or retail marijuana licenses for these premises have been
[17:26.760 --> 17:31.120]  suspended by order of the Denver department of excise and licenses for alleged
[17:31.120 --> 17:34.920]  Colorado or for alleged violations of Colorado law.
[17:34.940 --> 17:38.260]  And that is prominently displayed on the front door at sweet leaf dispensary.
[17:38.260 --> 17:42.460]  And it is the location at 2609 Walnut street is where this photo came from.
[17:43.020 --> 17:45.140]  A shout out to Alex who took the photo. Sorry,
[17:45.140 --> 17:47.900]  I cannot pronounce your last name, but I'll give you some credit. Cool photo.
[17:47.940 --> 17:50.260]  That's going to be legendary. Good shot, Alex.
[17:51.580 --> 17:54.500]  So the article goes on to say like this, all sweet leaf stores in Colorado,
[17:54.500 --> 17:57.300]  10 in Denver and one in Aurora were closed. Thursday.
[17:57.840 --> 18:00.780]  Names of the 12 people arrested were not immediately released.
[18:00.820 --> 18:03.220]  They were being booked into the downtown detention center.
[18:03.640 --> 18:07.120]  Police said the operation was conducted after a criminal investigation into the
[18:07.120 --> 18:10.040]  illegal distribution of marijuana at eight locations.
[18:10.440 --> 18:14.120]  The alleged criminal violations were related to the sale of marijuana in excess
[18:14.140 --> 18:17.920]  of allowable amounts established by amendment 60, 64,
[18:18.200 --> 18:20.160]  which allows for the personal use of marijuana.
[18:20.160 --> 18:23.520]  According to police department news release,
[18:23.860 --> 18:26.040]  no other marijuana businesses were included in the rates.
[18:26.040 --> 18:29.760]  The police said sweet leaf representative said in an emailed statement that they
[18:29.760 --> 18:31.600]  were surprised by police raids.
[18:31.780 --> 18:35.620]  It is unclear at this point exactly what actions if any sweet leaf took to cause
[18:35.980 --> 18:38.260]  the city to issue this order. The statement said,
[18:38.380 --> 18:41.940]  sweet leaf is cooperating with the authorities to resolve this issue and hopes to
[18:41.960 --> 18:45.580]  have all of their stores back in operation as soon as possible.
[18:45.860 --> 18:49.780]  It was not immediately clear to what extent sweet leaves facilities were affected
[18:49.780 --> 18:53.700]  beyond Denver and Aurora. Although the Aurora store was a rated,
[18:53.860 --> 18:57.040]  was rated and no one answered the location's phone on Thursday.
[18:57.040 --> 19:01.100]  The city has not suspended sweet leafs business license for its east sixth
[19:01.100 --> 19:04.440]  Avenue store said Julie Patterson and Aurora sports spokeswoman.
[19:04.920 --> 19:08.840]  We are waiting to receive more information from police investigators to determine
[19:09.080 --> 19:11.080]  whether we need to take any action. Oh man.
[19:11.400 --> 19:15.040]  Imagine being an employee at that store. You're just a sitting duck,
[19:15.040 --> 19:18.440]  shaking all day. Like, fuck, are they coming? Are they coming? Are they coming?
[19:18.440 --> 19:20.880]  I bet some people are not going to work tomorrow. They're like, yeah,
[19:20.880 --> 19:24.120]  we might be open, but I'm not showing the fuck up for my shift.
[19:24.440 --> 19:27.320]  I wouldn't go to work tomorrow. Fuck that. No,
[19:27.320 --> 19:30.840]  I'm done with like worrying about police raids and shit and worrying about cops
[19:30.840 --> 19:34.920]  and someone kicking in the door, going to jail, doing shit legit.
[19:34.940 --> 19:38.660]  I work for a legitimate company that doesn't do stuff like this. Uh,
[19:38.880 --> 19:41.900]  I would not fucking show up for work tomorrow if I worked at the, uh,
[19:42.220 --> 19:44.620]  east sixth Avenue location. Fuck that.
[19:44.620 --> 19:46.980]  I would be taking a sick day like a motherfucker.
[19:48.020 --> 19:49.660]  You can already tell my throat sounds like shit.
[19:49.680 --> 19:52.260]  I would not be at work tomorrow if this was me. All right,
[19:52.260 --> 19:53.340]  now let's continue with the article.
[19:53.340 --> 19:56.300]  It says sweet leaves dispensary in Portland, Oregon remained open.
[19:56.500 --> 19:59.780]  A person who answered the store's phone said the employee said store officials
[19:59.780 --> 20:04.320]  declined to comment. The coordinating coordinated enforcement action was solely,
[20:04.480 --> 20:07.080]  a Colorado agency effort headed by Denver police,
[20:07.080 --> 20:09.080]  which partnered with the Aurora police department,
[20:09.260 --> 20:12.920]  Colorado marijuana enforcement division, Denver district attorney's office,
[20:12.960 --> 20:14.400]  Denver city attorney's office,
[20:14.420 --> 20:18.680]  Denver department of excise and licenses and Denver department of public health.
[20:18.680 --> 20:21.600]  That's a lot of people to have come and knocking on your door. Uh,
[20:21.620 --> 20:25.440]  the U S drug enforcement and administration was not involved in the operation.
[20:25.440 --> 20:26.840]  Spokesman Randy lad said,
[20:27.300 --> 20:30.340]  and then they list all the sweet leaf locations that were rated. Uh,
[20:30.340 --> 20:35.340]  just in case you're interested, 1474 South of coma, 2647 West 38th,
[20:36.220 --> 20:40.140]  5100 West 38th, 4,400 East Evans,
[20:40.340 --> 20:44.180]  2609 Walnut street, 4125 North a lot.
[20:44.420 --> 20:49.420]  I don't know if I said that right. ELA TI street and 7,200 East Smith road.
[20:50.820 --> 20:53.020]  So I was right, right in my assumption.
[20:53.020 --> 20:55.700]  They were selling more cannabis than they should have been selling to each
[20:55.720 --> 20:59.680]  customer. So you guys check this out. If you are not from Colorado,
[20:59.680 --> 21:03.160]  or even if you are from Colorado and you go to a dispensary and you're that guy
[21:03.160 --> 21:05.680]  that's like, and you're shopping recreationally or even medically,
[21:06.040 --> 21:10.680]  and you're asking somebody to bend or break a rule and you are a dick because
[21:10.680 --> 21:14.360]  they won't break the rules because they are a well-trained trustworthy employee.
[21:14.800 --> 21:16.880]  This is why they are not breaking the rules.
[21:17.400 --> 21:20.280]  These guys lost eight dispensaries. Let's see.
[21:20.300 --> 21:23.200]  I want to scroll up and read how many licenses they lost. Cause it was crazy.
[21:23.620 --> 21:25.580]  Uh, eight places got raided.
[21:25.820 --> 21:30.820]  11 stores were closed and 26 licenses have been suspended because somebody in
[21:31.900 --> 21:36.860]  this company said that it was okay to break rules and create major violations.
[21:36.880 --> 21:39.900]  Now the whole company is being shut down.
[21:40.100 --> 21:43.940]  Everybody from the growers to the trimmers, to the bud tenders,
[21:43.940 --> 21:47.100]  to the managers, to the CEOs, they're all on hold right now.
[21:47.140 --> 21:48.500]  There might not be a business.
[21:48.660 --> 21:51.880]  Nobody knows what's going on with these licenses until they have their hearings.
[21:51.880 --> 21:53.620]  Usually these hearings happen within,
[21:53.620 --> 21:57.340]  I think it's about 30 days that have to be heard and everybody goes to court and
[21:57.340 --> 21:59.680]  talks about this. But until this happens,
[21:59.920 --> 22:02.080]  the growers don't know where their paycheck comes from.
[22:02.080 --> 22:04.140]  The trimmers don't know where their paycheck comes from.
[22:04.500 --> 22:08.500]  Everyone's in a scramble. So they got greedy. They tried to make extra money.
[22:08.540 --> 22:12.180]  They tried to break some rules and all they did was totally fuck themselves.
[22:12.380 --> 22:15.380]  26 licenses. You guys licenses are not cheap.
[22:15.700 --> 22:18.180]  If you fuck up with the license and they find out,
[22:18.480 --> 22:22.240]  they find that you are incapable of properly handling a license and conducting
[22:22.240 --> 22:25.500]  business like an adult. They will take your fucking license from you.
[22:25.760 --> 22:26.800]  And I don't know what happens to it.
[22:26.800 --> 22:29.120]  They sell it or you have to sell it to somebody else or something,
[22:29.120 --> 22:31.520]  but you're not allowed to hold a marijuana license,
[22:31.520 --> 22:34.520]  a business license for any type of cannabis related business anymore.
[22:34.800 --> 22:39.240]  They can do that. Who knows what's going to happen with these businesses?
[22:39.240 --> 22:41.880]  Who knows? There are bud tenders that are not at work.
[22:42.000 --> 22:43.560]  There's one location open tomorrow.
[22:44.320 --> 22:46.400]  And I don't know that those employees are going to want to go to work.
[22:46.420 --> 22:48.020]  They're probably paranoid and worried.
[22:49.260 --> 22:52.460]  Then now there's a whole company shut down millions of dollars.
[22:52.460 --> 22:56.380]  You guys millions of dollars, millions. I don't,
[22:56.380 --> 23:00.380]  I couldn't even fathom how many millions of dollars come with 26 licenses.
[23:00.820 --> 23:03.620]  So they say eight sweet leaf marijuana center locations.
[23:03.640 --> 23:07.020]  There's eight locations shut down, but there are 26 licenses,
[23:07.260 --> 23:09.660]  which means there are eight dispensaries.
[23:09.820 --> 23:14.460]  There are probably 10 grows that puts it 18 and then like maybe eight, uh,
[23:14.600 --> 23:18.120]  MIPS, which would be where they make edibles or where they make concentrates.
[23:18.480 --> 23:21.640]  MIPS is medically infused products is what that license is.
[23:21.680 --> 23:25.680]  MIP and that's where you can do extractions. They're all specialized.
[23:25.680 --> 23:28.920]  It's either a kitchen or a lab or whatever, but so yeah,
[23:28.920 --> 23:33.080]  they probably had eight dispensaries, 10 grows. It puts you at 18.
[23:33.300 --> 23:35.160]  And then however, whatever else I said, uh,
[23:35.200 --> 23:37.400]  eight more would be MIPS or whatever. I'm just guessing.
[23:37.400 --> 23:40.640]  I don't know what they really are, but 26 licenses have been taken away.
[23:41.240 --> 23:42.840]  So many people are going to be fucked you guys.
[23:42.860 --> 23:45.780]  So when you go to the dispensary and the bud tender won't break the rules or
[23:45.780 --> 23:48.940]  won't bend the rules or won't sell you extra or won't hook you up or you don't
[23:48.940 --> 23:51.900]  have the proper idea and they tell you, no, this is why you guys,
[23:51.900 --> 23:54.420]  we would like to keep our businesses. We would like to be employed.
[23:54.780 --> 23:56.100]  It is the middle of December.
[23:56.260 --> 23:58.900]  And now there are a bunch of people that were probably counting on that next
[23:58.900 --> 24:02.180]  paycheck that they're going to make over the next week to cover some Christmas
[24:02.180 --> 24:04.420]  gifts to cover something. People already spent money.
[24:04.420 --> 24:06.540]  I'm sure because it's Christmas time and we're fucking humans.
[24:06.540 --> 24:07.440]  We don't plan ahead.
[24:07.660 --> 24:10.540]  We just spend money that we don't have because the TV tells us that it's okay
[24:10.540 --> 24:13.880]  because just spend that money. And so they did, I bet you they did.
[24:13.880 --> 24:15.720]  Now these people are going to be fucked because they don't have a job.
[24:16.120 --> 24:20.360]  So stop breaking the rules. Stop asking people to break rules. And look,
[24:20.760 --> 24:23.680]  here's an example. There are rules in Colorado. We're not just,
[24:23.720 --> 24:25.000]  it's not the wild West anymore.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.780]  For you people that may think we're just out here slinging dope and nobody cares.
[24:28.900 --> 24:33.080]  There are rules. Doors got kicked in. Licenses were taken away.
[24:33.360 --> 24:36.320]  People are in jail. All right. I've got one more little piece.
[24:36.320 --> 24:39.440]  I want to add to this before I wrap up this segment of the show. Uh,
[24:39.440 --> 24:43.940]  this was from the Westward, which is, uh, if you're not from Colorado,
[24:43.940 --> 24:47.300]  the Westward is like a little local paper. It's the hip, cool, uh,
[24:47.340 --> 24:51.020]  color paper, uh, with all the ads in it and all the local stuff.
[24:51.020 --> 24:52.660]  It tells you about all the cool shows coming up.
[24:52.660 --> 24:54.300]  It tells you about all the art that's happening.
[24:54.580 --> 24:58.220]  And then the back three pages are all ads and coupons for dispensaries in
[24:58.220 --> 25:02.100]  Denver. Uh, but they put out a great magazine, I think monthly.
[25:02.480 --> 25:07.220]  And they also have a website and sweet leaf sent them a message.
[25:07.480 --> 25:11.960]  And it's an official assertion from corporate and Westward posted it.
[25:11.960 --> 25:13.120]  And it says this morning,
[25:13.120 --> 25:15.640]  sweet leaf was surprised to receive notification from the,
[25:15.680 --> 25:17.640]  from the department of excise and license,
[25:17.800 --> 25:21.720]  suspending all of our city licenses in the city and County of Denver.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.960]  It is unclear at this point, exactly what actions, if any sweet leaf took to cause
[25:26.280 --> 25:27.720]  the city to issue this order.
[25:27.880 --> 25:31.200]  Sweet leaf is cooperating with the authorities to resolve this issue and hopes
[25:31.220 --> 25:35.520]  to have all of their stores back in operation as soon as possible.
[25:36.220 --> 25:38.820]  Yeah. It said that they were cooperating. Of course they're cooperating.
[25:38.820 --> 25:43.140]  12 people are in jail. Now I'm curious. Are those people, uh, owners,
[25:43.140 --> 25:46.900]  are they corporate? It doesn't say I've been researching everything I can find.
[25:46.900 --> 25:50.860]  So far at the time of this recording, the people arrested have not been processed.
[25:50.860 --> 25:53.140]  They are still in booking in the Denver jail, the Denver,
[25:53.140 --> 25:56.180]  I don't know the Denver city, Denver County jail. They're still being processed.
[25:56.180 --> 25:58.300]  So I can't find any information on who it was.
[25:58.660 --> 26:02.140]  What I'm curious about is where they bud tenders, where they manage me,
[26:02.360 --> 26:05.560]  where they owners, where they, where were they in the food chain of the,
[26:05.600 --> 26:09.480]  of the company? Uh, because honestly, I don't know.
[26:09.560 --> 26:11.880]  I know there is a rule in place and I have to ask,
[26:11.960 --> 26:14.160]  we got to get white Mike in on this one. Uh,
[26:14.160 --> 26:17.160]  there's a rule that says if somebody commits a crime in the dispensary,
[26:17.160 --> 26:20.040]  that it's either the management's responsibility or the actual,
[26:20.200 --> 26:22.560]  like if a bud tender sells somebody illegally,
[26:22.780 --> 26:25.880]  I think the bud tender can actually legally be held responsible,
[26:26.120 --> 26:30.520]  but I'm not certain. So I think the bud tenders may be the ones detained.
[26:30.980 --> 26:35.420]  I'm not sure when I find out, I will let you guys know on a future episode.
[26:36.060 --> 26:39.860]  All right. So I took a second and contacted a compliance officer who knows a lot
[26:39.880 --> 26:43.500]  about the marijuana enforcement division rules and regulations. And they told me,
[26:43.500 --> 26:47.980]  yes, if a bud tender is caught violating a rule, they will be arrested and charged.
[26:48.060 --> 26:50.900]  But they also stated, they doubt that's what happened in this case.
[26:51.160 --> 26:53.780]  They said there's more to this case that they can't talk about right now.
[26:54.060 --> 26:57.420]  And they will talk to me in person because we were just texting. So, uh,
[26:57.460 --> 27:00.100]  they're an insider. They're in the industry. They know a lot of people.
[27:00.100 --> 27:03.440]  I'll find out some stuff and then I'll see what I can share with you,
[27:03.920 --> 27:07.080]  but it is not what it looks like is what I can say after reading that whole
[27:07.100 --> 27:08.880]  article and then talking with my friend,
[27:09.120 --> 27:11.440]  it doesn't appear to be what it looks like.
[27:11.460 --> 27:15.400]  This is a different thing than what I thought and what the reporters have all
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.160]  said so far. So I'll find out if there's anything else I can share with you guys.
[27:19.160 --> 27:21.720]  And then I will let you know, as soon as I've got some more information.
[27:22.200 --> 27:25.360]  All right. I'm running out of time and my throat is starting to get a little bit
[27:25.360 --> 27:29.520]  funky, but I want to read one email and then we're going to wrap up this podcast.
[27:29.540 --> 27:33.100]  I know there wasn't a whole lot of very specific cannabis education this time,
[27:33.360 --> 27:36.780]  but the theme of the show is cannabis news, education and conversation.
[27:36.780 --> 27:39.300]  You got some news and conversation for sure.
[27:39.660 --> 27:43.740]  I think the last episode was very, uh, education based.
[27:44.220 --> 27:48.060]  So we're evening shit out. I hope you like it. All right.
[27:48.180 --> 27:50.700]  So this email goes like this. It says, Hey Jeff,
[27:50.700 --> 27:52.500]  been a long time listener of the podcast.
[27:52.500 --> 27:55.920]  So much good information to learn from and I appreciate you putting it out
[27:55.920 --> 27:57.580]  there. Well, you're very welcome. Thanks for the email.
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  It goes on to say the reason I'm writing is I would like to possibly get ahold
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.420]  of some of your seeds and was wondering if you could shoot me in the direction
[28:04.420 --> 28:07.600]  as to where to find some. Yes.
[28:07.680 --> 28:12.200]  Google the Hella Dank Seed Company or go to dankseed.store and you will be able
[28:12.200 --> 28:16.800]  to find seeds. If you type in Hella Dank Seed Bank, I read genetics,
[28:17.080 --> 28:18.120]  you will be golden.
[28:18.120 --> 28:21.000]  Hella Dank Seed Bank is the place I recommend today,
[28:21.280 --> 28:24.680]  or you can always check my friends out at thedankteam.com.
[28:24.780 --> 28:29.780]  The dank team.com thedankteam.com check Hella Dank Seed Bank or thedankteam.com
[28:32.300 --> 28:35.900]  are two great places to get iri genetic seeds. Uh, let's see.
[28:35.900 --> 28:40.220]  The email goes on to say I will be road tripping around Colorado in a couple of
[28:40.220 --> 28:44.020]  weeks. So destination is not much of a concern. Uh, when did you write this?
[28:44.020 --> 28:46.580]  This was a while ago. That trip already happened. I hope you had a good time.
[28:46.580 --> 28:49.700]  I apologize for missing you. I'm just going through old emails and catching up.
[28:50.220 --> 28:52.980]  He says specifically, I would like to find some lemon, Jeffrey, golden goat,
[28:52.980 --> 28:55.720]  or a rise. The arise is available.
[28:55.880 --> 28:58.280]  The golden goat won't be available for a long time.
[28:58.480 --> 29:00.520]  The lemon Jeffrey is not available by itself,
[29:00.520 --> 29:02.920]  but it is available in the form of lemon sunrise,
[29:03.120 --> 29:05.760]  which is lemon Jeffrey cross to the arise.
[29:05.760 --> 29:08.840]  So that's available at the dank team and the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[29:09.440 --> 29:10.560]  The email goes on to say,
[29:10.800 --> 29:13.640]  I know you recently mentioned that you don't care to mess with feminized seeds,
[29:13.880 --> 29:16.520]  but if there are any feminized seeds of these strains floating around,
[29:16.520 --> 29:19.440]  I would like to get my hands on them. Uh,
[29:19.980 --> 29:24.060]  there are no more golden goat or lemon Jeffrey feminized seeds available right
[29:24.080 --> 29:27.940]  now that may change in the future, but currently that's not a thing.
[29:28.260 --> 29:31.940]  A rise is currently not available in a feminized seed form.
[29:31.940 --> 29:36.500]  So no feminized seeds right now from me, although, um,
[29:36.700 --> 29:40.180]  I will be making a new line of feminized seeds very soon.
[29:40.540 --> 29:43.780]  I'm going to reverse a male, a female plant and turn it into a male.
[29:44.100 --> 29:47.180]  I'm going to pollinate a few things. I will test run those.
[29:47.360 --> 29:51.000]  If I like what comes out of those, I will do it again and put it into production.
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.360]  I was asked to do a favor for somebody because they really liked to strain and
[29:54.360 --> 29:58.120]  they wanted to play with seeds of it. So I'm going to make S ones of a strain.
[29:58.320 --> 30:00.000]  I'll talk about it a little more in the future,
[30:00.280 --> 30:02.800]  but that's what I'm doing with feminized seeds.
[30:02.820 --> 30:05.680]  I've got a whole new plant that I'm going to be reversing.
[30:05.680 --> 30:07.800]  I'm going to make a whole new line of femme stuff.
[30:07.800 --> 30:11.000]  There will only be about four or five crosses in the whole line,
[30:11.520 --> 30:13.040]  but those will be coming in a little bit here.
[30:13.120 --> 30:16.160]  I'm going to get back to this email and get my brain back focused.
[30:16.180 --> 30:20.740]  He says, I hope to hear back from you and keep up the good work on the podcast.
[30:21.900 --> 30:23.180]  Hey, thanks. I'll keep up the good work.
[30:23.180 --> 30:26.140]  I apologize for taking forever to get back to you with the emails.
[30:26.140 --> 30:30.580]  I've got a lot of emails. Obviously the email goes on to say,
[30:30.660 --> 30:33.460]  I lost my space. Here we go. It is by far one of my top three,
[30:33.460 --> 30:36.420]  right alongside Joe Rogan experience. Wow.
[30:36.860 --> 30:39.940]  I'm in the top three right alongside Joe Rogan. So who else is up there?
[30:39.940 --> 30:42.540]  I want to know who number three is. It's Joe Rogan myself.
[30:42.540 --> 30:45.700]  And who else do you have up there? I'm very curious. And honestly,
[30:45.960 --> 30:46.600]  it's an honor.
[30:46.600 --> 30:50.760]  Every time somebody compares me to Joe Rogan in podcasting or in any way,
[30:50.780 --> 30:51.360]  shape or form,
[30:51.360 --> 30:54.400]  it's a fucking honor because Joe Rogan is an amazing individual.
[30:54.400 --> 30:58.360]  That man's a savage. There's never an insult to be compared to Joe Rogan.
[30:58.360 --> 30:59.720]  So thank you for that huge compliment.
[30:59.960 --> 31:03.640]  I'm glad that my podcast is one of your favorites, right alongside Joe Rogan.
[31:04.400 --> 31:06.360]  I listened to Joe Rogan kind of religiously.
[31:06.680 --> 31:10.080]  Rogan puts out three, sometimes four or five shows every week.
[31:10.440 --> 31:14.560]  And I listened to almost every second of every show that that guy puts out.
[31:15.060 --> 31:17.500]  That's one of my favorite podcasts. So I'm glad you dig it with me.
[31:17.500 --> 31:20.580]  I'm glad we're probably listening to the Joe Rogan experience together.
[31:20.600 --> 31:24.180]  Sometimes during long days at work, man, thanks for the huge compliment.
[31:24.420 --> 31:29.200]  He also says, PS, you should do more organic episodes on organic growing.
[31:29.200 --> 31:33.980]  I know it's not your thing, but I'm sure many listeners would enjoy hearing them.
[31:34.580 --> 31:37.140]  Yes. I would love to get more organic episodes going.
[31:37.140 --> 31:41.020]  I need to schedule some more organic based growers to come and be on the show
[31:41.020 --> 31:43.180]  with me. I've just been chaotic lately.
[31:43.180 --> 31:46.320]  My schedule is hard to nail down. Other people are hard to nail down.
[31:46.560 --> 31:49.520]  I need to reach out to some folks and have them come be on the podcast and talk
[31:49.520 --> 31:53.600]  about organics. You are right. The email finishes up like this. He says, thanks.
[31:53.600 --> 31:58.360]  And if this makes it on your show, please don't mention my name. All right, dude,
[31:58.360 --> 31:59.160]  I won't mention your name,
[31:59.160 --> 32:02.260]  but I do want to give you a huge thanks for sending me a great email for letting
[32:02.260 --> 32:06.440]  me ramble on about getting some seeds. I hope your trip to Colorado was fun.
[32:06.460 --> 32:08.760]  I apologize for not linking up with you and dude,
[32:08.760 --> 32:10.480]  huge thanks for the compliment.
[32:11.300 --> 32:13.380]  I love hearing that I'm somebody's favorite podcast,
[32:13.380 --> 32:17.340]  but saying that I'm right alongside the Joe Rogan experience never gets old.
[32:17.500 --> 32:19.180]  All right, you guys, if you want to send me an email,
[32:19.180 --> 32:22.020]  I would love to hear from you. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[32:22.220 --> 32:26.780]  You never know. I may read your email on a future episode.
[32:27.380 --> 32:29.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for me to start wrapping up this podcast.
[32:29.980 --> 32:32.860]  I feel like I've been talking super fast. I've been rambling my ass off.
[32:33.060 --> 32:36.020]  I hope you enjoyed this episode. If you're listening on iTunes,
[32:36.040 --> 32:38.980]  I hope you go to iTunes and leave me a rating and a review. Also,
