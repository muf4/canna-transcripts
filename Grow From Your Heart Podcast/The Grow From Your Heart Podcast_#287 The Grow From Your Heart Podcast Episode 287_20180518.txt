[00:15.680 --> 00:18.200]  Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:18.200 --> 00:21.720]  It's time for episode number 287 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.920 --> 00:25.920]  You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:25.920 --> 00:27.920]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.960 --> 00:30.040]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.480 --> 00:33.560]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:33.560 --> 00:37.200]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:38.000 --> 00:39.960]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.760]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:42.760 --> 00:46.040]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.040 --> 00:49.520]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat,
[00:50.400 --> 00:52.680]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.680 --> 00:58.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am coming to you on a frosty cold Colorado evening.
[00:59.200 --> 01:03.680]  It's been snowing for about 18 hours now and there is no end in sight.
[01:04.440 --> 01:06.760]  It's cold out there. You guys, the snow is deep.
[01:06.800 --> 01:08.920]  The streets are slick and it sucks.
[01:10.040 --> 01:12.520]  I had to brave the cold to go grab some hash today.
[01:12.560 --> 01:15.040]  I was running low on concentrates and with the storm coming down,
[01:15.040 --> 01:17.440]  I was not going to get trapped at home without enough hash,
[01:17.680 --> 01:20.320]  without enough concentrates to smoke on throughout the weekend here.
[01:20.600 --> 01:24.320]  So I made it over to Dr's Orders and I grabbed myself some of this sour diesel
[01:24.480 --> 01:26.880]  sugar and some sour diesel live batter.
[01:27.440 --> 01:31.200]  I was extracted by our friends at the Garden of Wheaton and they always do great
[01:31.200 --> 01:33.320]  work. So shout out to Dr's Orders at STEM beach.
[01:33.720 --> 01:36.600]  And also a big shout out to our friends at the Garden of Wheaton.
[01:36.720 --> 01:39.760]  I'm lit up on this sour diesel. You guys, this is a very unique high.
[01:40.120 --> 01:41.760]  It does something that not a lot of strains do.
[01:41.760 --> 01:44.840]  It's got that high thing. I think when you smoke flowers,
[01:45.120 --> 01:47.800]  your eyes get droopy and you get stoned. But when I smoke concentrates,
[01:47.800 --> 01:49.000]  I don't get the droopy eyes.
[01:49.280 --> 01:52.520]  This sour diesel does that shit to my eyes and I really enjoy it.
[01:52.520 --> 01:53.520]  So shout out to all my friends.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.600]  Thanks to my friends for the great service out there at Dr's Orders. Yes,
[01:56.600 --> 01:58.000]  I do work for another dispensary.
[01:58.440 --> 02:00.640]  I was kind of far away and it was fucking snowing.
[02:00.840 --> 02:03.880]  This place was closer and they have quality products. And you know what?
[02:03.880 --> 02:06.800]  My friends work out there too. And they were great. They were super kind.
[02:06.800 --> 02:08.440]  They were friendly. They were, they were helpful.
[02:08.440 --> 02:11.360]  And they made recommendations on products that I approved of.
[02:11.360 --> 02:13.440]  So I do support other dispensaries.
[02:13.560 --> 02:15.240]  I would recommend you shop at the one I grow for,
[02:15.240 --> 02:18.960]  but you got to go other places. I get it. So shout out to my friends.
[02:18.960 --> 02:23.120]  It took good care of me. Let's see. Let's move into a podcast a little bit.
[02:23.120 --> 02:25.360]  Let's talk about my breeding projects.
[02:25.360 --> 02:27.960]  You guys seem to love it when I talk about the breeding projects.
[02:28.160 --> 02:31.320]  I've had two projects going simultaneously in different locations.
[02:31.720 --> 02:36.400]  One of them was including the star dog cross to arise and the
[02:36.400 --> 02:39.880]  Durban poison cross to arise and platinum tangy to arise.
[02:39.880 --> 02:41.440]  And there were several others in there.
[02:41.440 --> 02:44.160]  Those plants have been harvested. Ladies and gentlemen, they are down.
[02:44.160 --> 02:46.520]  The Durban poison took a little bit longer than everybody else,
[02:46.840 --> 02:48.360]  but they are harvested.
[02:48.360 --> 02:50.520]  The plants are hanging up. Most of them are dried.
[02:50.680 --> 02:53.200]  Some of them have been bucketed or put into bins.
[02:53.560 --> 02:56.920]  I put them, I just break them off the stick into the bins and let the buds dry out.
[02:57.160 --> 02:59.720]  And then I'll go and mash it up in a little tiny pieces with my hands.
[02:59.720 --> 03:01.520]  And then I will pull the seeds out.
[03:01.520 --> 03:05.040]  I'm looking at a seed separating machine, but it is quite pricey.
[03:05.120 --> 03:06.680]  That may be in the future.
[03:06.680 --> 03:09.200]  But yeah, they are dry. They're drying up. They're ready.
[03:09.200 --> 03:10.720]  Seeds are falling out.
[03:10.720 --> 03:13.640]  So in the very near future, we will have some new crosses to test.
[03:13.640 --> 03:16.760]  And I will also be able to replenish the hell a dank seed bank
[03:16.760 --> 03:19.200]  with brand new batches of seeds.
[03:19.680 --> 03:22.960]  Let's see. Also, the other breeding project I'm working on is a reversed
[03:23.160 --> 03:24.080]  blueberry cookies.
[03:24.080 --> 03:28.960]  I've got a blueberry cookies girl that I treated with a silver thiosulfate solution.
[03:29.200 --> 03:31.200]  I reversed it. I turned it into a boy.
[03:31.480 --> 03:32.480]  It dropped pollen.
[03:32.480 --> 03:35.840]  I put that pollen on another blueberry cookies female.
[03:35.840 --> 03:38.600]  I also put that pollen on a platinum tangy female.
[03:38.800 --> 03:42.040]  I put that pollen on a strawberry fields female.
[03:42.280 --> 03:45.640]  I also put that pollen on Durban poison and a rise.
[03:45.640 --> 03:46.560]  There may be another one in there,
[03:46.560 --> 03:48.560]  but I can't think of what it is off the top of my head.
[03:48.560 --> 03:50.320]  Lemon skunk. That's what it is.
[03:50.320 --> 03:53.680]  So I'm hoping to make a whole bunch of candy flavored
[03:53.840 --> 03:55.760]  turp filled plants with that cross.
[03:55.760 --> 03:58.840]  Most of those crosses with that experiment there with that breeding project.
[03:58.840 --> 04:01.840]  Most of those probably won't be available for a very long time.
[04:01.840 --> 04:03.360]  I will test them. I'll grow them myself.
[04:03.360 --> 04:05.960]  It's a very small breeding project.
[04:05.960 --> 04:08.120]  Then if I like what I've made, I will do it again
[04:08.120 --> 04:13.000]  and we will make those feminized blueberry skunk reversals available
[04:13.720 --> 04:14.960]  at the hell of dank seed bank.
[04:14.960 --> 04:17.920]  I guess that's a good way to segue into some advertising with the hell
[04:17.920 --> 04:19.480]  of dank seed bank.
[04:19.480 --> 04:23.040]  If you're looking for iri genetic seeds, look no further than the hell
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.040]  of dank seed bank. That's right.
[04:24.040 --> 04:28.680]  Visit dank seed dot store for all of your iri genetics needs.
[04:30.040 --> 04:31.920]  All right. What else do you guys want to talk about today?
[04:31.920 --> 04:33.760]  Let's get into some iTunes comments.
[04:33.760 --> 04:36.040]  I've got four brand new iTunes comments.
[04:36.400 --> 04:38.520]  I really appreciate it when you guys leave comments.
[04:38.520 --> 04:41.200]  They are actually ratings and reviews on iTunes.
[04:41.200 --> 04:43.360]  If you're interested in leaving an iTunes rating and review,
[04:43.600 --> 04:45.680]  simply go to iTunes.
[04:45.680 --> 04:47.000]  There is a section.
[04:47.000 --> 04:47.720]  Go to the search bar.
[04:47.720 --> 04:50.120]  Type in the name of the girl from your heart podcast.
[04:50.120 --> 04:51.120]  It'll bring up the podcast.
[04:51.120 --> 04:53.040]  There's a section right in the middle. It says ratings and reviews.
[04:53.040 --> 04:54.200]  They've made it a lot easier.
[04:54.200 --> 04:56.160]  Click on ratings and reviews.
[04:56.160 --> 04:58.040]  You're able to click on an amount of stars.
[04:58.040 --> 04:59.720]  I'm scrolling up to see so far.
[04:59.720 --> 05:03.120]  I've got 94 ratings and it says five point out of five.
[05:03.120 --> 05:04.600]  So I've got five stars.
[05:04.600 --> 05:07.520]  Whatever that bad rating was, it got removed or it got corrected.
[05:07.520 --> 05:09.280]  There was one that only gave me four. It is gone.
[05:09.280 --> 05:12.320]  So I've got 94 five star reviews.
[05:12.320 --> 05:14.320]  You guys, you can go in and type a review.
[05:14.320 --> 05:15.800]  You can give me a rating.
[05:15.800 --> 05:18.200]  I encourage you to give me as many stars as you feel I deserve.
[05:18.200 --> 05:21.280]  So far, 94 people have given me a five star review.
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.560]  Let's read the most recent reviews.
[05:24.560 --> 05:27.600]  I'm going to turn down this music so I can hear myself think a little bit.
[05:27.600 --> 05:29.800]  And these reviews go like this.
[05:29.800 --> 05:32.240]  This one was left by a person who calls himself my jam.
[05:32.240 --> 05:34.040]  This was left on January 18th.
[05:35.440 --> 05:37.760]  Looks like their Instagram name is Warpath Glass.
[05:38.480 --> 05:40.000]  The review goes like this.
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.160]  This is the best podcast out for Colorado culture and education.
[05:43.160 --> 05:44.680]  Rasta Jeff, you are killing it.
[05:44.680 --> 05:46.760]  Keep it up and stay iry.
[05:46.760 --> 05:49.160]  Hey, my jam. Thanks for the great compliments. I appreciate that.
[05:49.640 --> 05:51.440]  I never thought it was a competition or anything,
[05:51.440 --> 05:53.560]  but it sounds like if there were a competition,
[05:53.560 --> 05:56.280]  I would be winning because you called me the best and I appreciate it.
[05:56.520 --> 05:58.840]  Hey, I will keep killing it and I will always stay iry.
[05:58.880 --> 05:59.920]  You do the same, my jam.
[05:59.920 --> 06:01.320]  Thanks for the great comment.
[06:01.320 --> 06:03.200]  And of course, the five stars.
[06:04.120 --> 06:08.040]  The next review comes from somebody who calls themselves Grimble the Druid.
[06:08.080 --> 06:09.720]  We've talked a little bit on Instagram live.
[06:09.720 --> 06:11.760]  What's up, buddy? Good seeing you on here.
[06:11.760 --> 06:15.520]  He says Rasta man, you can call me Grimble if you want to read this on the air.
[06:15.520 --> 06:16.960]  Well, I already called you Grimble the Druid
[06:16.960 --> 06:19.000]  because I read your name out loud, so I apologize for that.
[06:19.000 --> 06:20.000]  Hope that's cool.
[06:20.000 --> 06:21.680]  Anyway, the review goes like this.
[06:21.680 --> 06:24.240]  So when I first started listening to the show a long time ago,
[06:24.440 --> 06:27.240]  you and White Mike always said to tell a friend about the show if you could.
[06:27.720 --> 06:29.760]  Chronic Kobe was that friend for me.
[06:29.760 --> 06:31.160]  So it was really cool to hear.
[06:31.160 --> 06:35.560]  He made me realize I really owed you a review for all the content I've enjoyed.
[06:35.560 --> 06:39.680]  So just to update you guys on that on the last episode, when I read the comments,
[06:39.840 --> 06:42.680]  I read a review from somebody who called themselves Chronic Kobe.
[06:43.080 --> 06:46.440]  And apparently that was Grimble the Druid's buddy who introduced him
[06:46.640 --> 06:48.560]  or who he introduced to the podcast.
[06:48.560 --> 06:51.560]  So, dude, thanks for sharing the podcast and thanks for remembering
[06:51.560 --> 06:54.040]  to leave a review after your buddy did so.
[06:54.040 --> 06:55.000]  Then he says show review.
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.400]  Definitely still one of my favorite podcasts to listen to.
[06:57.520 --> 07:00.000]  Even a few years in, I always look forward to waking up
[07:00.120 --> 07:02.440]  to a new episode on Mondays.
[07:02.440 --> 07:05.680]  In-depth, step by step information, unbiased, solid show.
[07:05.840 --> 07:09.600]  No doubt about it has increased my knowledge and abilities as a grower.
[07:09.600 --> 07:12.360]  Keep up the great work on Instagram, too.
[07:12.800 --> 07:14.680]  And that's a lot of great compliments in there.
[07:14.680 --> 07:15.160]  Let's see.
[07:16.200 --> 07:17.440]  Favorite podcast.
[07:17.440 --> 07:19.600]  One of your favorite podcasts. Awesome. Thank you.
[07:19.640 --> 07:21.760]  I hope Joe Rogan and Joey Diaz are right up there.
[07:22.040 --> 07:23.680]  He looks forward to waking up soon on Mondays.
[07:23.680 --> 07:24.720]  That's why I put it out on Monday.
[07:24.720 --> 07:26.800]  You guys, I want you to have a fresh new episode on Mondays
[07:26.800 --> 07:28.240]  because Mondays do kind of suck.
[07:28.280 --> 07:32.400]  At least my podcast is some light at the end of that crappy Monday tunnel.
[07:33.240 --> 07:35.360]  In-depth, step by step information.
[07:35.360 --> 07:38.720]  Yes, sometimes I feel like I'm a little too in-depth and too step by step,
[07:38.720 --> 07:40.200]  but you can't see me.
[07:40.200 --> 07:42.040]  So I have to paint a really good picture
[07:42.040 --> 07:44.960]  and I have to talk both of us through what we're trying to do.
[07:45.080 --> 07:47.560]  So I'm glad you enjoy the in-depth, step by step part.
[07:48.120 --> 07:50.160]  He also says unbiased, solid show.
[07:50.440 --> 07:51.880]  Sometimes I'm biased, dude.
[07:51.880 --> 07:54.800]  I try to be fair, but I do have my own opinions and feelings.
[07:55.320 --> 07:58.080]  And sometimes I'm not afraid to let them fly.
[07:58.320 --> 07:59.760]  I share my opinions and feelings.
[07:59.760 --> 08:02.720]  So I do appreciate that you think I'm unbiased and fair,
[08:02.720 --> 08:04.200]  but sometimes I do put my own.
[08:04.200 --> 08:05.840]  It's my show, so I can say whatever I want.
[08:05.840 --> 08:07.760]  So I do put my opinion into it quite often.
[08:07.760 --> 08:09.600]  But thank you for the compliments.
[08:09.600 --> 08:12.400]  No doubt about it has increased my knowledge and abilities as a grower.
[08:12.640 --> 08:13.480]  That's what I'm here for.
[08:13.480 --> 08:15.800]  I want everybody to be a better grower.
[08:15.960 --> 08:17.560]  I want everybody to be a better activist.
[08:17.560 --> 08:20.600]  I want everybody to be more informed and more comfortable with cannabis.
[08:20.840 --> 08:23.240]  So Grimball the Druid, dude, thanks for the great review.
[08:23.480 --> 08:25.200]  Thanks for the five stars. I appreciate it.
[08:25.200 --> 08:27.000]  And I look forward to seeing you on Instagram.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.040]  He also ends his review with keep it up on Instagram.
[08:29.280 --> 08:31.560]  You guys, if you're not following me on Instagram, you should.
[08:31.600 --> 08:33.320]  It's Iree underscore genetics.
[08:33.320 --> 08:37.840]  I R I E underscore G E N E T I C S on Instagram.
[08:37.840 --> 08:38.880]  I read genetics.
[08:38.880 --> 08:41.320]  I post a lot of cannabis photography.
[08:41.320 --> 08:44.480]  If you're into cannabis, cannabis photography, you would appreciate it.
[08:44.520 --> 08:46.880]  All right. I'm trying to make the iPad close this review and open up the next one.
[08:46.880 --> 08:48.800]  It says like this.
[08:48.800 --> 08:51.400]  It says like this. That's weird when I say that it goes like this.
[08:51.400 --> 08:53.760]  What's up, Rasta Jeff? This is Johnny Snipes.
[08:53.760 --> 08:56.840]  And then whatever you put in parentheses there doesn't show up.
[08:56.840 --> 08:59.320]  It shows a parentheses and an F and I can't read the rest of that.
[08:59.320 --> 09:02.160]  So I apologize if there's more there, I'm supposed to read Johnny Snipes.
[09:02.560 --> 09:03.440]  It didn't pop up.
[09:04.520 --> 09:06.320]  Then he goes like this, it goes like this.
[09:06.320 --> 09:07.720]  Why do I keep fucking saying that? That's weird.
[09:07.720 --> 09:10.960]  I recently found your podcast because of Mary's motivations on Instagram.
[09:10.960 --> 09:12.040]  What's that Mary's motivation?
[09:12.040 --> 09:13.320]  You guys should follow Mary's motivation.
[09:13.320 --> 09:15.720]  You actually just released a podcast.
[09:15.720 --> 09:16.720]  I should have a better shout out.
[09:16.720 --> 09:18.960]  I'm going to press pause and get that correct information right now.
[09:18.960 --> 09:19.640]  Here we go. Hold on.
[09:20.880 --> 09:23.960]  All right, guys, I found the correct web page, it's just Mary's motivation dot com
[09:23.960 --> 09:27.360]  go to Mary's motivation dot com and listen to my friend Brett's new podcast.
[09:27.360 --> 09:28.200]  It's a great podcast.
[09:28.200 --> 09:31.600]  I do not feel threatened by sharing other cannabis related podcasts with you.
[09:31.880 --> 09:34.840]  Brett and I have a very different approach to cannabis and podcasting,
[09:35.280 --> 09:38.400]  but we agree with each other wholeheartedly and we're very good friends.
[09:38.400 --> 09:40.040]  I got nothing but love and respect for Brett.
[09:40.040 --> 09:41.480]  Brett, I love you, bro. Hope you're listening to this.
[09:41.480 --> 09:43.360]  But you guys go check him out on Instagram.
[09:43.360 --> 09:45.400]  Mary's motivations or Mary's motivation.
[09:45.400 --> 09:47.000]  I'm not sure if the S is on there or not.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.440]  And Mary's motivation dot com and check out his podcast.
[09:49.640 --> 09:51.240]  Let's get back to Johnny Snipes's review.
[09:51.240 --> 09:54.360]  Recently found your podcast because of Mary's motivation on Instagram.
[09:54.360 --> 09:56.200]  And so happened to be the perfect timing
[09:56.200 --> 09:58.720]  because I was in the middle of my first grow from bag seed.
[09:58.920 --> 10:00.520]  And that's awesome. I'm glad that timed out well.
[10:00.520 --> 10:03.040]  I'm glad that, you know, Brett also because Brett's a ray of sunshine.
[10:03.400 --> 10:05.800]  I also said I loved the drying and curing episode.
[10:05.800 --> 10:08.560]  It was really helped me understand the process more living in Colorado
[10:08.560 --> 10:11.160]  and the dry climate. It was very difficult to dial that in.
[10:11.440 --> 10:14.560]  Yes, that drying cure episode will have to be adjusted everywhere you are.
[10:14.560 --> 10:16.640]  It's going to be something you're going to have to monitor.
[10:16.640 --> 10:19.880]  Drying and curing are totally different from California to Colorado, to Maine,
[10:20.120 --> 10:22.440]  to Portland, Oregon, to whatever.
[10:22.680 --> 10:24.720]  Phoenix, Arizona, it's going to be different everywhere you go.
[10:24.920 --> 10:27.000]  So I'm glad you're able to dial that in.
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.920]  He also says another favorite was the HCHT FSC episode.
[10:31.160 --> 10:34.320]  I would love to see a future episode on more about hash
[10:34.320 --> 10:38.160]  and the full spectrum side of things and your opinion on sauce versus butter.
[10:38.320 --> 10:40.120]  And that's a great recommendation there.
[10:40.120 --> 10:40.960]  I might write that down.
[10:40.960 --> 10:43.040]  Then he also says, thanks for your knowledge, Rasta Jeff.
[10:43.040 --> 10:45.040]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[10:45.040 --> 10:47.280]  Feel free to use my name, dude.
[10:47.280 --> 10:49.560]  I'm glad you said that because I already shared your name
[10:49.560 --> 10:51.720]  at the very beginning on accident, so I'm glad that was cool.
[10:52.040 --> 10:57.320]  Let's see. You wanted more about my opinion on sauce versus butter.
[10:57.880 --> 11:00.880]  Now, sauce is usually when you mix a little bit of HCHT FSC
[11:00.880 --> 11:03.280]  with a little bit of HCHT FSC, I believe,
[11:04.160 --> 11:07.880]  which is kind of what the ambrosia is from apothecary.
[11:07.880 --> 11:10.120]  They're mixing it, pre mixing it for you, basically.
[11:10.320 --> 11:12.720]  And this I'm not completely they keep everything a secret.
[11:12.720 --> 11:15.040]  They will not give you information, but this is from paying attention.
[11:15.040 --> 11:15.720]  It's what I think
[11:16.320 --> 11:20.120]  they did say that their batters were whipped ambrosia.
[11:20.120 --> 11:24.640]  So when they advertise ambrosia batter, it's just their ambrosia
[11:24.640 --> 11:25.600]  that they took and whipped it.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.920]  I think, but you said butter, which could be kind of it.
[11:31.040 --> 11:32.240]  It's all about that texture.
[11:32.240 --> 11:34.080]  Sometimes the sauce is hard to fuck with.
[11:34.080 --> 11:37.160]  There are times when I'm dabbing and it can find space.
[11:37.560 --> 11:39.080]  Like I try not to say I'm dabbing in the garbage.
[11:39.080 --> 11:40.440]  Everybody fucking knows I dab in the car.
[11:40.440 --> 11:40.960]  Sorry, Mike.
[11:40.960 --> 11:42.040]  Sometimes I dab in the car.
[11:43.040 --> 11:45.680]  Sometimes I dab in the car and the saucy shit is hard to fuck
[11:45.960 --> 11:47.000]  with in the car.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.800]  It's just easier for me to have some butter or some batter
[11:49.800 --> 11:51.600]  or some shatter for the car.
[11:51.600 --> 11:54.640]  That's mainly why I like a different consistency.
[11:54.880 --> 11:58.440]  I do love the crystals and I do love the turps, but.
[11:59.960 --> 12:02.160]  It's not necessary to go that far.
[12:02.160 --> 12:05.560]  I just bought some some batter and some sugar, and it's just fine.
[12:05.760 --> 12:09.280]  The batter will be easier should I decide to partake in the car.
[12:09.400 --> 12:11.120]  Yes, you guys, I know the rules.
[12:11.120 --> 12:12.920]  Sometimes life doesn't always allow for that.
[12:12.920 --> 12:14.960]  There's not always a safe place to medicate.
[12:15.200 --> 12:16.800]  So here's a good example.
[12:16.800 --> 12:20.800]  I was in the parking lot at the Indo Expo, parked with my keys in my pocket,
[12:20.800 --> 12:21.880]  not driving.
[12:21.880 --> 12:23.320]  There was no place to medicate.
[12:23.320 --> 12:25.600]  I had to be at the Indo Expo for about 10 hours.
[12:26.480 --> 12:27.640]  I medicated in the car.
[12:27.640 --> 12:29.040]  I was in park.
[12:29.040 --> 12:30.040]  Nothing was going to happen.
[12:30.040 --> 12:33.640]  So in that type of situation, I would prefer something
[12:33.640 --> 12:37.200]  that's not goopy and saucy and that I'm not going to spill in the car and need.
[12:37.480 --> 12:39.440]  It just it's not as easy batter.
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.040]  I can just put the batter on the dabber and dab it shatter.
[12:42.040 --> 12:44.720]  I can actually break off a piece of shatter and drop it in the banger.
[12:45.040 --> 12:47.880]  It just it's mostly about ease when it comes to that point.
[12:47.880 --> 12:52.080]  But the butters versus the saucy stuff, the sauce is cool.
[12:52.080 --> 12:54.680]  If you have something easier to dab it with and you're at home
[12:54.680 --> 12:58.440]  and you got all your supplies, but if you're on the move, that batter stuff,
[12:58.440 --> 13:00.360]  that's the only reason I have a preference.
[13:00.680 --> 13:03.440]  Otherwise, let's fucking dab either one.
[13:03.440 --> 13:06.000]  You got I like the I like the crystals a lot.
[13:06.240 --> 13:07.480]  They're just hard to manage.
[13:07.480 --> 13:11.360]  So the way I do it, I usually buy a gram of the batter and a gram
[13:11.360 --> 13:13.920]  of the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals.
[13:14.200 --> 13:15.120]  I put a little bit.
[13:15.120 --> 13:18.000]  Now I put a lot of the batter on the dabber, and then I break up
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.200]  some of the crystals and roll the batter dabber into the crystals
[13:21.200 --> 13:22.040]  so that it collects it.
[13:22.040 --> 13:25.360]  It looks like a sugar donut or a sugar cookie or a powder donut.
[13:25.360 --> 13:26.760]  It's what I thought I was going to say.
[13:26.760 --> 13:28.680]  And then I dab that together that way.
[13:28.680 --> 13:30.960]  So I think I like them both.
[13:30.960 --> 13:32.920]  The sauce is just turps in there.
[13:32.920 --> 13:35.000]  That's what makes it saucy.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.840]  Sometimes they're overdoing those turps.
[13:37.840 --> 13:41.320]  And I know that sounds fucking ridiculous, but I don't need it.
[13:41.320 --> 13:43.080]  That turpy sometimes it's overwhelming.
[13:43.080 --> 13:45.600]  It burns my sinuses when there's too much turps in there.
[13:45.920 --> 13:46.200]  So.
[13:47.280 --> 13:51.000]  And I like them both equally, but for ease, I go for the batter
[13:51.000 --> 13:51.680]  with the crystals.
[13:52.520 --> 13:52.960]  There you go.
[13:52.960 --> 13:54.320]  You don't have to wait for another episode, Johnny.
[13:54.320 --> 13:55.320]  You got it right now.
[13:55.320 --> 13:56.640]  Great question.
[13:56.640 --> 13:57.800]  You just got like a combo move.
[13:57.800 --> 14:00.840]  You get to leave a review and you got to ask a question at the same time.
[14:00.840 --> 14:01.840]  That's like a combo.
[14:01.840 --> 14:02.920]  Good job, bro.
[14:02.920 --> 14:03.760]  Thanks for the great review, man.
[14:03.760 --> 14:05.640]  Thanks for the five star rating also.
[14:05.640 --> 14:07.840]  So there is one more that I'd like to read on this episode.
[14:07.840 --> 14:10.840]  This one was left on Thursday by a person who goes by the name of Rogers
[14:10.840 --> 14:13.960]  1023 on iTunes, the headline says, love the show.
[14:13.960 --> 14:16.000]  And of course, they gave me five stars.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.040]  I'm clicking more so it'll enlarge.
[14:18.040 --> 14:21.000]  And it says, just like all the good books out there, including all the Jeff
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.800]  Lohenfels teaming books, your stories and insight helped me in so many ways.
[14:25.080 --> 14:26.600]  For first time growers.
[14:26.600 --> 14:29.600]  Thumbs up to your guests also for all the info they share.
[14:29.840 --> 14:32.880]  Thumbs up to Jesse, too, for all the info he shares.
[14:32.920 --> 14:33.560]  Hey, thank you, man.
[14:33.560 --> 14:34.640]  You're very welcome.
[14:34.640 --> 14:35.480]  Thanks for the thank you.
[14:35.480 --> 14:36.760]  I'm glad you enjoyed the podcast.
[14:36.760 --> 14:39.360]  I'm glad you're listening to the podcast.
[14:39.400 --> 14:44.240]  I'm glad being a grower with a lot of experience and someone who thinks
[14:44.240 --> 14:45.840]  very quickly and talks a lot.
[14:46.600 --> 14:50.640]  I have to remember to include the new growers in my rants.
[14:50.640 --> 14:53.680]  I have to remember that not everybody has been growing for a hundred
[14:53.680 --> 14:55.240]  years in a commercial facility.
[14:55.480 --> 14:58.040]  So I'm glad I have not lost the new growers.
[14:58.040 --> 15:01.880]  I'm glad I keep it interesting for the experienced growers, and I'm
[15:01.880 --> 15:04.160]  glad I'm not losing the new guys.
[15:04.160 --> 15:05.240]  So I'm hitting my target.
[15:05.440 --> 15:08.120]  That's a huge compliment without even realizing that you're giving me.
[15:08.360 --> 15:08.920]  So thank you.
[15:08.920 --> 15:09.840]  I appreciate that.
[15:10.640 --> 15:14.080]  Also, thanks for the great review and thank you for the five stars.
[15:14.360 --> 15:17.360]  And then you said thumbs up to Jesse and my friends for all the info he shares.
[15:17.360 --> 15:19.120]  We got to also thank Frosty.
[15:19.120 --> 15:20.200]  We got to thank Sean.
[15:20.520 --> 15:23.760]  We got to thank everybody that's ever been on the podcast, especially White Mike.
[15:23.760 --> 15:25.920]  He comes and spends a lot of time over here on the show.
[15:26.680 --> 15:30.120]  So not just Jesse, but, or myself, but big thumbs up to everybody that's been on
[15:30.120 --> 15:32.440]  the show and all the people that I do have lined up to be on the show.
[15:32.440 --> 15:37.160]  I've got somebody, I've asked them to be on the show to talk about lab testing.
[15:37.560 --> 15:40.040]  I've got a couple of other growers and breeders lined up to be on the show.
[15:40.040 --> 15:44.120]  I just have to create the time and maybe get over the anxiety of getting new
[15:44.120 --> 15:46.800]  people on the show and get them on here and bring the content to you.
[15:46.960 --> 15:49.640]  So, man, thanks for the, the great review.
[15:49.640 --> 15:53.960]  Thanks for the five stars and a man, huge compliments without even realizing it.
[15:54.240 --> 15:55.120]  I appreciate that.
[15:55.600 --> 15:57.360]  All right, you guys, that was all the iTunes reviews.
[15:58.280 --> 16:01.400]  Thank you to everybody that left me a new iTunes rating and review.
[16:01.400 --> 16:04.400]  And also thank you to everybody who has left one in the past that really
[16:04.400 --> 16:06.120]  helps the podcast move in the rankings.
[16:06.200 --> 16:09.840]  The more reviews we get, the more exposure we get in iTunes, which means
[16:09.840 --> 16:12.800]  more people will see the show, which means more people will listen, which
[16:12.800 --> 16:16.600]  means more people will join us in the fight to legalize cannabis, and also
[16:16.600 --> 16:20.600]  more people will join us in growing quality cannabis, and that's what we
[16:20.600 --> 16:24.720]  want is everybody to be able to grow the best cannabis they can grow.
[16:25.960 --> 16:28.240]  All right, podcast world, let's move forward a little bit.
[16:28.480 --> 16:31.520]  Let's talk about the throwback Thursday episodes.
[16:31.520 --> 16:32.000]  That's right.
[16:32.320 --> 16:34.920]  Those of you that listen to the podcast and have been listening for a while,
[16:34.920 --> 16:38.680]  know that every Thursday I put out what is called a throwback Thursday episode.
[16:38.680 --> 16:42.960]  I go grab old episodes and I put them in blocks of three and I let them out on a
[16:42.960 --> 16:46.160]  Thursday so that you guys can get old content back into the feed.
[16:46.600 --> 16:48.920]  I am caught up on throwback Thursday episodes.
[16:49.160 --> 16:53.240]  As I was making episodes, I realized the next episode in my feed is a throwback
[16:53.240 --> 16:58.240]  Thursday episode, which tells me I am caught up, so I am going to figure out
[16:58.240 --> 17:02.720]  something new, I'm not going to promise content every Thursday, I will continue
[17:02.720 --> 17:06.640]  to bring you new episodes every single Monday, but we're going to do random
[17:06.640 --> 17:09.200]  things on Thursdays until I figure out what I want to do.
[17:09.480 --> 17:12.280]  I'd like to promise you a whole new episode every Thursday, but I don't want
[17:12.280 --> 17:15.840]  to commit to that just yet because it does take a lot of time to put together a
[17:15.840 --> 17:18.520]  podcast and right now I am simply at the limit.
[17:18.520 --> 17:20.120]  I can't take more projects right now.
[17:20.320 --> 17:22.240]  I need to eliminate some shit to tell you the truth.
[17:22.280 --> 17:23.560]  It will not be podcasting.
[17:23.880 --> 17:27.040]  Whatever I eliminate will make room for better podcasts.
[17:27.040 --> 17:28.320]  That's one of the things I'd like to do.
[17:28.600 --> 17:32.640]  Clear my plate to get more time to do more podcasts, but I've got to figure out
[17:32.640 --> 17:33.680]  another Thursday plan.
[17:34.440 --> 17:36.080]  I may just put out random episodes.
[17:36.080 --> 17:39.680]  I may just talk about random shit that doesn't qualify for a Monday episode.
[17:39.680 --> 17:43.040]  I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet, but Thursday, if an episode doesn't pop
[17:43.040 --> 17:44.280]  out, don't panic.
[17:44.400 --> 17:45.520]  It's because we're all caught up.
[17:45.720 --> 17:50.320]  I'll let a few episodes go, maybe put another hundred or another 50 episodes out
[17:50.320 --> 17:53.640]  into the feed and then start doing the throwback Thursday episodes again.
[17:54.880 --> 17:55.440]  I'm not sure.
[17:56.240 --> 17:59.040]  I'm not going to set anything in stone, but I promise you the Monday
[17:59.040 --> 18:00.000]  episodes will keep going.
[18:00.040 --> 18:03.160]  Also, if you're looking for old episodes, they are on YouTube.
[18:03.200 --> 18:06.200]  The first hundred and 50 are on YouTube and I am putting out more
[18:06.200 --> 18:07.680]  episodes as time goes by.
[18:08.040 --> 18:09.680]  Like I said, I'm slightly overwhelmed.
[18:10.160 --> 18:13.320]  Uh, if I do eliminate some things, I will make time for more
[18:13.320 --> 18:15.240]  podcasting and more YouTube videos.
[18:15.840 --> 18:16.160]  All right.
[18:16.160 --> 18:19.720]  So we covered Thursday when an episode doesn't come out Thursday, please don't
[18:19.720 --> 18:21.720]  panic, please don't blow up my inbox.
[18:22.280 --> 18:25.600]  I appreciate the support, but we're going to start skipping Thursdays for a minute.
[18:25.920 --> 18:28.360]  I'm not going to promise what's going to happen, but we may skip a Thursday.
[18:28.440 --> 18:29.920]  So don't freak out if that happens.
[18:30.520 --> 18:32.080]  All right, let's move forward.
[18:32.080 --> 18:33.280]  I have got an email.
[18:33.600 --> 18:35.680]  This one says hi, Ross to Jeff.
[18:35.720 --> 18:38.760]  Thank you so much for being the incredible human being that you are.
[18:38.760 --> 18:44.680]  Feel free to read any or all of this on the air, including my name and the PS is
[18:44.680 --> 18:45.520]  what we're going to do that.
[18:45.520 --> 18:46.560]  It goes just like this.
[18:46.880 --> 18:50.280]  I appreciate all of your amazing energy, detailed cultivation, knowledge,
[18:50.320 --> 18:53.680]  industry updates, life wisdom, and all of the goodness you share on
[18:53.680 --> 18:54.960]  the grow from your heart podcast.
[18:55.240 --> 18:55.680]  Holy shit.
[18:55.680 --> 18:56.280]  That's huge, dude.
[18:56.280 --> 18:56.680]  Thank you.
[18:56.680 --> 18:57.520]  Amazing energy.
[18:57.520 --> 18:58.040]  Thanks a lot.
[18:58.360 --> 19:00.400]  I try to be in a positive, good mood when I record.
[19:00.680 --> 19:02.960]  I'm glad you noticed detailed cultivation knowledge.
[19:03.400 --> 19:06.120]  Like I said before, sometimes a little too detailed, I feel like, but I'm
[19:06.120 --> 19:07.680]  glad that it's working for you.
[19:07.720 --> 19:08.720]  Industry updates.
[19:09.120 --> 19:10.680]  I try to stay on top of the industry.
[19:10.720 --> 19:11.200]  It's hard.
[19:11.240 --> 19:12.600]  There's so much going on.
[19:12.880 --> 19:13.800]  Uh, life wisdom.
[19:14.240 --> 19:15.040]  I'm just old, bro.
[19:16.120 --> 19:18.760]  Uh, and then he also says in all of the goodness you share on the
[19:18.760 --> 19:19.600]  growth from your heart podcast.
[19:19.600 --> 19:20.120]  Hey, you're welcome.
[19:20.160 --> 19:20.600]  Thank you.
[19:20.800 --> 19:23.320]  It's a paragraphs like that make it all worth it.
[19:23.720 --> 19:27.320]  He also goes on to say, I'm thrilled to support you on Patrion with a $4 and 20
[19:27.520 --> 19:28.840]  contribution per month.
[19:29.320 --> 19:30.400]  Uh, let me mention Patreon.
[19:30.400 --> 19:32.520]  You guys, Patreon is a website.
[19:32.880 --> 19:36.440]  If you feel like you want to contribute to a podcast financially,
[19:36.520 --> 19:38.400]  Patreon is the way to do so.
[19:38.760 --> 19:41.320]  Go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[19:41.640 --> 19:45.040]  All of the information that you need to sign up for Patreon will be right there.

[19:48.720 --> 19:51.840]  website alive, which is where I host the podcast for free.
[19:52.200 --> 19:54.200]  It also helps me get these microphone covers.
[19:54.520 --> 19:57.160]  I'm going to need a new Mac book pro here pretty soon.
[19:57.360 --> 20:00.000]  Things like that come from Patreon contributions.
[20:00.160 --> 20:03.280]  So if you would like to contribute patreon.com slash grow from your
[20:03.280 --> 20:04.280]  heart is the way to do it.
[20:04.600 --> 20:07.920]  Uh, the email I'm reading right now, I don't know if he wants me to say his name.
[20:08.440 --> 20:12.040]  Um, it doesn't say if I can say his name, but our friend, uh, just
[20:12.040 --> 20:14.760]  contributed $4 and 20 cents per month.
[20:14.760 --> 20:15.480]  So I appreciate that.
[20:15.480 --> 20:16.880]  Thank you for the huge contribution.
[20:17.680 --> 20:21.720]  Then he goes on to say, I really appreciate how you cover so much grow knowledge.
[20:21.760 --> 20:23.440]  I love your theory on airy buds.
[20:23.440 --> 20:24.600]  That was a recent episode I did.
[20:24.800 --> 20:25.200]  Thank you.
[20:25.200 --> 20:26.320]  I'm glad you agree with that.
[20:26.880 --> 20:30.800]  Uh, and I also dive into legalities, politics and how people are affected and
[20:30.800 --> 20:32.320]  more special thanks.
[20:32.720 --> 20:34.320]  Oh, he said that he loves how I do that.
[20:34.320 --> 20:38.520]  I dive into legalities, politics, how people are affected and much more special
[20:38.520 --> 20:42.240]  thanks to Cheryl and Jeremy at love for the plant for sharing their experiences
[20:42.240 --> 20:44.880]  with discrimination and for teaching us about their grow.
[20:45.160 --> 20:49.520]  It meant a lot to me and my heart goes out to them and the many people globally
[20:49.600 --> 20:50.920]  dealing with discrimination.
[20:51.160 --> 20:51.920]  Thanks guys.
[20:52.040 --> 20:55.800]  So that was a big thank you to Cheryl and Jeremy, uh, for sharing their story.
[20:55.800 --> 20:57.840]  They did share some personal stories on the podcast.
[20:57.840 --> 21:00.880]  If you didn't listen to that one, go check out the podcast titled titled
[21:00.960 --> 21:03.760]  love for the plant, and you'll know what our friend here is talking about.
[21:04.640 --> 21:05.520]  So the email goes on.
[21:05.520 --> 21:09.160]  It says, I have a super important question slash topic that I am not sure
[21:09.160 --> 21:12.840]  you have covered recently, which is cultivation software, seed to sale,
[21:12.840 --> 21:15.920]  tracking apps, other grow apps, and et cetera.
[21:15.960 --> 21:17.680]  He said, I'm super proud to share that.
[21:17.680 --> 21:21.560]  I've joined the industry as an interface designer with flourish software, making
[21:21.560 --> 21:24.760]  the shift from other industries to the cannabis movement has made me very happy.
[21:24.760 --> 21:28.200]  Loving what you do and being passionate about the movement you're doing it for
[21:28.200 --> 21:31.720]  is an incredible combination, perhaps one of the best in life.
[21:31.760 --> 21:32.800]  Yes, absolutely.
[21:33.160 --> 21:34.040]  I know that feeling.
[21:34.040 --> 21:36.840]  And I get to see people enter the cannabis industry.
[21:37.360 --> 21:38.440]  I'm I'm spoiled.
[21:38.440 --> 21:38.960]  I've been here.
[21:38.960 --> 21:41.760]  I watched it develop and I've been into it since the beginning.
[21:41.760 --> 21:43.120]  I was doing it before I should have.
[21:43.120 --> 21:43.920]  So I'm spoiled.
[21:44.240 --> 21:47.120]  I get to see a lot of my trim crew, a lot of my crew that works with me.
[21:47.520 --> 21:50.480]  Uh, there are two dudes from Texas and sometimes the look on their
[21:50.480 --> 21:52.680]  faces is just like, Holy shit.
[21:53.040 --> 21:56.360]  And I forget that I forget that feeling of being new.
[21:56.720 --> 21:59.960]  And so it's great seeing people move from Texas where they were oppressed
[22:00.200 --> 22:05.040]  and afraid to come here, to get to walk into a room filled with 300 plants
[22:05.040 --> 22:08.120]  that are six feet tall and just filled with buds, that smile on their face.
[22:08.360 --> 22:11.160]  It's fucking amazing every time to me still.
[22:11.160 --> 22:14.880]  So I know the feeling that you're getting being in the industry that you love and
[22:14.880 --> 22:18.240]  doing what you love to do and being passionate about your work, it does put
[22:18.240 --> 22:21.560]  something different into your day when you actually care about what you're doing.
[22:21.560 --> 22:24.760]  If I didn't care about my job, everything would be totally different in my life.
[22:24.760 --> 22:27.400]  I wouldn't give a shit to take care of myself because I wouldn't need
[22:27.400 --> 22:29.080]  to be healthy to do a good job.
[22:29.080 --> 22:31.000]  I wouldn't rest well because I wouldn't need to be sharp
[22:31.000 --> 22:32.440]  with my mind to do a good job.
[22:32.800 --> 22:35.240]  If I didn't have this career path, I don't know what I would have done.
[22:35.240 --> 22:39.640]  I would have been a musician and I'd probably be a, and not such good mental
[22:39.640 --> 22:42.600]  or physical health if I were still on the road with the band, all right.
[22:43.440 --> 22:44.280]  Let's keep going.
[22:44.280 --> 22:48.160]  He says, uh, as I've come on board with flourish, there are tons of apps
[22:48.160 --> 22:51.120]  popping up in the landscape of options is evolving quickly.
[22:51.400 --> 22:52.200]  I am curious.
[22:52.200 --> 22:55.000]  What cultivation software do you use at the commercial grow?
[22:55.000 --> 22:55.480]  You run.
[22:56.360 --> 22:59.000]  The next question is, have you heard great things about any
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.440]  other gross software out there?
[23:00.640 --> 23:04.960]  Then the third question is, is any of the cultivation software you've used, uh, or
[23:04.960 --> 23:08.360]  heard about missing features that would make it amazing, and then also ask for
[23:08.360 --> 23:12.080]  any software to avoid or anything else you can think of related to cultivation
[23:12.080 --> 23:17.000]  software, well, uh, in Colorado, we are required to use the marijuana enforcement
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.200]  divisions tracking system known as metric it's M E T R C.
[23:20.240 --> 23:22.080]  I don't remember exactly what that stands for.
[23:22.320 --> 23:24.640]  It's a marijuana enforcement tracking.
[23:25.280 --> 23:30.280]  Uh, R C I don't know what the R tracking and something that I don't, but
[23:30.280 --> 23:34.040]  anyway, metric M E T R C it's everybody is required to use metric.
[23:34.080 --> 23:35.480]  Every plant is put into metric.
[23:35.480 --> 23:39.040]  When you look at a facility on Instagram, if you look at the pictures, you see
[23:39.040 --> 23:42.160]  those yellow or blue tags, those are metric tags.
[23:42.160 --> 23:44.480]  Yellow are for medical marijuana facilities.
[23:44.480 --> 23:47.120]  Blue are for recreational cannabis facilities.
[23:47.680 --> 23:50.080]  Um, all of those are called metric tags.
[23:50.080 --> 23:53.080]  Each of those plants is in a program called metric.
[23:53.080 --> 23:54.840]  They all get an RFID number.
[23:55.360 --> 24:00.280]  So the minute I cut a clone, I write down the mother plant RFID number.
[24:00.280 --> 24:05.080]  So if that, if my mother plant is, I'm just going to say no plant number 5,000.
[24:05.360 --> 24:07.040]  I write down plant number 5,000.
[24:07.040 --> 24:13.280]  I cut 50 clones of Durban poison plant number 5,000 on February 10th into this
[24:13.280 --> 24:17.400]  dome, those get entered into metric as new clones that came from a mother plant.
[24:18.040 --> 24:24.160]  When they get potted into soil, they get moved from clone to vegetative plant.
[24:24.160 --> 24:28.200]  They are now a veg plant and they get a tag and now they are RFID tagged.
[24:28.240 --> 24:29.280]  They get their own number.
[24:29.600 --> 24:33.440]  So now those plants have a mother plant number that they came from and a date in
[24:33.440 --> 24:35.560]  which they were created and a batch number.
[24:35.920 --> 24:40.480]  Then they move into a small plant with its own individual tag.
[24:41.480 --> 24:44.160]  That tag will stay with that plant until it's harvested.
[24:44.640 --> 24:49.360]  So when I move it to flower, I have to go to that plant and find that plant and
[24:49.360 --> 24:53.360]  actually tag it in the computer that has been moved into the flowering stage and
[24:53.360 --> 24:55.760]  mark which flowering room I have moved it to.
[24:56.800 --> 25:00.920]  If I kill that plant before it's harvested, I have to take that plant tag.
[25:00.960 --> 25:01.880]  I don't do this honestly.
[25:01.880 --> 25:03.720]  White Mike does this at the facility.
[25:03.720 --> 25:05.360]  This is just the metric part of it.
[25:05.640 --> 25:09.280]  If I kill that tag, I take that tag to Mike and Mike enters it in the computer
[25:09.280 --> 25:13.520]  as a dead plant and has to give us full sentence reason as to why it got killed.
[25:13.840 --> 25:17.960]  He can't just type in dead or ugly or died or male.
[25:18.120 --> 25:20.120]  He's got to type in like several words.
[25:20.120 --> 25:23.200]  They ask for more words to explain why that plant is gone.
[25:23.200 --> 25:25.760]  So everybody is using metric, everybody in Colorado.
[25:26.120 --> 25:29.280]  I know there are other states using metric because I see their
[25:29.280 --> 25:30.880]  customer support on the website.
[25:30.920 --> 25:33.840]  Honestly, I haven't paid attention because I haven't needed to, but I
[25:33.840 --> 25:35.560]  know other states are using metric.
[25:36.080 --> 25:38.800]  Um, mainly what other software do we use?
[25:38.960 --> 25:39.760]  Google docs.
[25:39.760 --> 25:41.280]  We use a lot of Google docs.
[25:41.560 --> 25:45.880]  I say Google docs really funny when I'm stoned, but Google has a
[25:45.880 --> 25:48.360]  docs program that is very reliable.
[25:48.960 --> 25:51.760]  Uh, not to diss your software, but Google docs does almost
[25:51.760 --> 25:53.120]  between metric and Google docs.
[25:53.120 --> 25:56.400]  We can do almost everything we need done and they're reliable.
[25:56.400 --> 25:59.160]  Google docs, but it's just going to fucking keep saying it.
[25:59.440 --> 25:59.880]  I like that.
[25:59.880 --> 26:01.360]  I can update a document right now.
[26:01.360 --> 26:05.360]  And in real time, Mike's at his house bouncing Davey on his knee,
[26:05.480 --> 26:07.920]  watching fucking cartoons.
[26:08.080 --> 26:10.680]  And he can look at his computer and live real time.
[26:10.680 --> 26:14.160]  Watch me update a Google document so we can update inventory sheets.
[26:14.360 --> 26:17.480]  And I can share those with all of my management, uh, with whoever.
[26:17.840 --> 26:19.040]  And it that's really nice.
[26:19.040 --> 26:22.840]  So Google docs and metric are mainly what we use in the commercial facility.
[26:22.840 --> 26:26.720]  We also use another app called base camp, which is just a communications app.
[26:27.240 --> 26:28.960]  Uh, it's basically like a forum.
[26:28.960 --> 26:29.600]  That's private.
[26:29.640 --> 26:32.400]  Only members of my facility are allowed to see it.
[26:32.400 --> 26:35.160]  And then I'm in other groups to where there's a management group, a
[26:35.160 --> 26:37.160]  cultivation group and an HR group.
[26:37.160 --> 26:40.400]  And then another group that's like a private group that only a few of us are
[26:40.440 --> 26:42.480]  in for like secret conversations.
[26:42.480 --> 26:45.200]  So that if we have to have an email conversation that we don't need other
[26:45.200 --> 26:47.880]  people in only the people that are checked off in that group and see it.
[26:48.560 --> 26:52.080]  But so base camp metric and Google docs are mainly what we use.
[26:53.120 --> 26:58.480]  The only other software that I've really played with was old stuff, uh, like MMJ
[26:58.480 --> 26:59.640]  menu and things like that.
[27:00.040 --> 27:03.920]  And they, uh, didn't have enough plant movement stuff and enough plant
[27:03.920 --> 27:05.520]  data stuff that would have been nice.
[27:05.840 --> 27:09.600]  Another thing that I have played with was the smart B controller setup.
[27:09.840 --> 27:11.680]  It does not give me any plant data.
[27:12.080 --> 27:16.920]  It is only room data, but they have a light temperature and humidity sensor.
[27:17.320 --> 27:21.760]  That gives me a lot of data that helps me adjust my rooms a lot.
[27:21.760 --> 27:26.440]  They tell me second by second real time information, uh, the humidity, the
[27:26.440 --> 27:28.280]  temperature, how much light is in there.
[27:28.520 --> 27:31.480]  There are sensors that tell me how wet or dry my medium is.
[27:31.720 --> 27:33.560]  I really like the smart B setups.
[27:33.560 --> 27:40.880]  Unfortunately, uh, they had some operating errors in my facility and I sent them back.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.760]  I wasn't, I'm not dissing this company.
[27:42.760 --> 27:46.200]  It did not work for me and my facility and what we were trying to do.
[27:47.240 --> 27:47.920]  It's cool shit.
[27:48.120 --> 27:49.800]  It just didn't work for what we were trying to do.
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.000]  If you're going to use your smart B system for a home grow or a medium
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.680]  size grow, there should be no problem.
[27:55.880 --> 27:58.920]  My grow is too large and the devices could not connect.
[27:59.480 --> 28:03.680]  I have nothing against smart B controllers, just not the units for my facility.
[28:03.680 --> 28:08.080]  So, um, have I heard any great things about any other software out there?
[28:08.080 --> 28:10.960]  Honestly, I don't pay attention enough to grow software.
[28:10.960 --> 28:16.000]  I pay more attention to genetics, nutrients, lighting, HVAC.
[28:16.440 --> 28:20.040]  Uh, I guess I've kind of, yeah, I should pay more attention to that.
[28:20.040 --> 28:23.480]  It's not, I'm a pen and paper kind of a grower and I know that seems weird,
[28:23.480 --> 28:26.400]  but I like writing pencil to paper.
[28:26.400 --> 28:27.040]  It just feels good.
[28:27.080 --> 28:29.040]  I've got a dry erase board that's filled with notes.
[28:29.040 --> 28:30.680]  I've got a pocket full of notes all the time.
[28:30.960 --> 28:32.520]  I like the pen to paper kind of thing.
[28:32.520 --> 28:36.240]  I feel like I remember stuff in my brain absorbs it more and remembers
[28:36.240 --> 28:39.720]  it more if I write something down, it does something to my storage.
[28:40.240 --> 28:42.800]  For my brain a little bit better when I put the pen to paper.
[28:43.360 --> 28:46.320]  So I may not be the guy to talk about grow software, honestly,
[28:46.560 --> 28:48.160]  uh, between metric and Google docs.
[28:48.160 --> 28:51.160]  I think I've got everything covered, but you asked me some questions.
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.360]  Uh, is there anything that I've used or heard missing man metrics sucks
[28:55.400 --> 29:00.520]  because it is used by every facility and dispensary in Colorado.
[29:00.520 --> 29:03.640]  If you've got to grow, if you've got a processing plant, if you make
[29:03.640 --> 29:08.000]  edibles, if you make extractions, uh, if you have a dispensary, if you
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.480]  have a delivery company, if you're doing anything in Colorado with a marijuana
[29:12.480 --> 29:18.160]  enforcement division regulated facility, you have to be on metric and it will
[29:18.160 --> 29:21.440]  freeze and you get that spinning wheel of fuck you metric death.
[29:21.480 --> 29:22.800]  It just turns and turns and turns.
[29:22.800 --> 29:26.240]  I've walked into the office and literally found Mike smacking his
[29:26.240 --> 29:27.320]  head into the computer screen.
[29:27.320 --> 29:28.200]  And I go, what are you doing, buddy?
[29:28.200 --> 29:30.400]  And he was just watching metric fucking spin.
[29:30.760 --> 29:32.800]  And then I walked downstairs and my phone will ring and it'll be
[29:32.800 --> 29:33.920]  Jenny and she'll be at work.
[29:33.920 --> 29:35.880]  She's a, she works at a dispensary also.
[29:36.400 --> 29:38.800]  Uh, and I don't know her exact title and I don't want to get it wrong.
[29:38.800 --> 29:39.440]  Or I would tell you what she does.
[29:39.440 --> 29:42.840]  She's like a manager and a whole bunch of other things at a dispensary.
[29:43.280 --> 29:45.640]  And I'll call her and I'll be like, what you doing?
[29:45.640 --> 29:48.760]  And she'll be like, I'm watching this fucking wheel on metric, just spin around.
[29:49.160 --> 29:51.440]  And as the cultivation guy, I don't have to mess with that a lot.
[29:51.440 --> 29:52.120]  I am blessed.
[29:52.720 --> 29:56.920]  Um, something I have heard that is missing is shit that works.
[29:56.960 --> 29:58.720]  Metric seems to take for fucking ever.
[29:58.960 --> 30:02.960]  So if you're going to design something and make it nationally used, make it to
[30:02.960 --> 30:06.760]  where it works when a lot of people get on it, because right now you can look on
[30:06.760 --> 30:10.200]  Facebook sometimes during the middle of the day and you can see everybody in
[30:10.200 --> 30:14.600]  Colorado bitching about metric being frozen and when metric freezes, it slows
[30:14.600 --> 30:16.800]  down business and production for everybody.
[30:16.800 --> 30:18.200]  And it actually costs us money.
[30:18.360 --> 30:21.880]  I've had delivery drivers sitting in the lobby of my facility for an hour.
[30:22.120 --> 30:23.320]  Waiting for metric to load.
[30:23.440 --> 30:26.240]  So I can simply print the manifest that they need.
[30:26.680 --> 30:30.480]  I know that sounds stupid, but you can't leave the facility with 50 pounds of
[30:30.480 --> 30:32.200]  product without the proper paperwork.
[30:32.200 --> 30:33.200]  I need a signed copy.
[30:33.200 --> 30:34.200]  You need a signed copy.
[30:34.480 --> 30:35.840]  And you'll say, why didn't you print it before?
[30:36.400 --> 30:39.120]  We don't print it before because sometimes these guys show up in a different car
[30:39.120 --> 30:42.640]  than last time, and it has to have their license plate number, their ID number,
[30:42.640 --> 30:43.840]  and sometimes shit changes.
[30:44.040 --> 30:46.400]  And it's easier just to print it when they get there, because if you print it
[30:46.400 --> 30:49.360]  before I guarantee you something has changed.
[30:49.720 --> 30:49.920]  All right.
[30:50.240 --> 30:51.680]  So make stuff that works.
[30:51.680 --> 30:52.800]  That's my recommendation.
[30:53.120 --> 30:54.680]  Uh, any software to avoid?
[30:54.880 --> 30:59.280]  Like I was saying, I haven't used enough to give you any idea on that.
[31:00.000 --> 31:01.320]  Then I like your last question.
[31:01.320 --> 31:04.280]  Anything else you can think of related to cultivation software?
[31:05.200 --> 31:06.800]  Here's something that I don't know if you're going to do this.
[31:06.800 --> 31:07.920]  I haven't looked at your website.
[31:07.920 --> 31:09.640]  I don't know what your designs are.
[31:10.280 --> 31:12.160]  Don't make it look like a cheesy video game.
[31:12.400 --> 31:12.680]  Yes.
[31:12.680 --> 31:13.560]  We are growing cannabis.
[31:13.560 --> 31:15.080]  Don't put any hippie theme shit in there.
[31:15.120 --> 31:16.840]  Don't put Rasta themed shit in there.
[31:17.040 --> 31:19.280]  No red, yellow, and green, no rainbows, no tie dye.
[31:19.320 --> 31:20.520]  Make it a computer program.
[31:20.600 --> 31:21.800]  Make it pleasing to the eye.
[31:21.800 --> 31:22.280]  Yes.
[31:22.600 --> 31:23.960]  But please don't make it a cartoon.
[31:23.960 --> 31:24.960]  Don't make it a video game.
[31:24.960 --> 31:25.840]  Keep it seriously.
[31:26.040 --> 31:27.160]  That's what I would like to see.
[31:27.760 --> 31:30.840]  I find it really hokey that everything cannabis related is
[31:30.840 --> 31:32.560]  also hippie and Rasta related.
[31:32.760 --> 31:33.040]  Yes.
[31:33.040 --> 31:34.080]  That shit goes hand in hand.
[31:34.080 --> 31:35.480]  I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[31:35.680 --> 31:36.760]  I listened to the Grateful Dead.
[31:36.760 --> 31:40.360]  I'm a Rasta man, but your computer program doesn't have to be also.
[31:41.160 --> 31:43.680]  Maybe give people the option to have different skins.
[31:43.680 --> 31:47.640]  Maybe you can have the, uh, the serious skin, the calculator skin, the science
[31:47.640 --> 31:51.960]  skin, and then the tie dyed one and the Rasta one, but don't make that like the
[31:51.960 --> 31:53.920]  default that just makes it, I don't know.
[31:53.920 --> 31:54.640]  It makes it cheesy.
[31:54.680 --> 31:56.040]  In my opinion, it makes it hokey.
[31:56.400 --> 32:01.160]  If you spent less time coloring it up to appeal to hippies and Rastas and actually
[32:01.160 --> 32:04.400]  made a computer program that appealed to tech people and people trying to keep
[32:04.400 --> 32:07.280]  data, it would be more efficient in my opinion, and I don't know what you're
[32:07.280 --> 32:10.120]  doing, so I'm just voicing concerns off the top of my head.
[32:10.560 --> 32:15.240]  Um, I would like to see a program that I can enter what strain I grew, how many
[32:15.240 --> 32:21.200]  of them, what each harvest weight was, and then that'll keep tabs on like averages
[32:21.200 --> 32:25.640]  for me, and then I can just keep tabs on there and then maybe the next harvest, I
[32:25.640 --> 32:26.480]  could do the same thing.
[32:26.480 --> 32:28.440]  I grew 20 platinum tangy plants.
[32:28.880 --> 32:29.920]  Each plant weighed this.
[32:29.920 --> 32:31.960]  The average of that plant was this.
[32:32.160 --> 32:35.960]  The average waste was this, the amount of, or the amount of trim material was this.
[32:36.280 --> 32:41.160]  And then start, let that spreadsheet start documenting averages for me over
[32:41.160 --> 32:45.200]  different harvests, but I would have to input everything still, but I think
[32:45.200 --> 32:46.640]  our Google docs are doing mostly that.
[32:46.640 --> 32:48.360]  And I've got a manager that does all that for me.
[32:48.360 --> 32:49.120]  Shout out to Greeny.
[32:49.520 --> 32:51.760]  Uh, Greeny is, so I've got a program.
[32:51.760 --> 32:52.040]  You're right.
[32:52.040 --> 32:52.880]  I am using software.
[32:52.880 --> 32:54.040]  It's called David Greenman.
[32:54.080 --> 32:54.960]  He does all that for me.
[32:54.960 --> 32:56.720]  So shout out to Mike, shout out to David Greenman.
[32:57.160 --> 32:59.120]  They're the guys you need to talk to about software.
[32:59.120 --> 33:03.320]  If you want input, those guys are the ones that have the input like this for you.
[33:03.960 --> 33:06.800]  So I do appreciate the question, but I, like I've said a couple of minutes ago,
[33:06.800 --> 33:09.280]  I don't think I'm the guy to ask about the software.
[33:09.280 --> 33:11.240]  I am the guy with my fingers in the dirt.
[33:11.240 --> 33:12.680]  I am the guy getting dirty.
[33:13.080 --> 33:13.760]  Uh, writing.
[33:13.800 --> 33:14.840]  I got a clipboard, man.
[33:14.880 --> 33:17.480]  I'm not as much on the computer as I should be.
[33:17.920 --> 33:22.560]  I write it down on paper and then pass it on to Mike and then Mike sends it in an
[33:22.560 --> 33:25.560]  email to Greeny and then Greeny does the spreadsheet part.
[33:25.560 --> 33:26.840]  So Greeny is my software.
[33:26.840 --> 33:27.600]  I'm not even kidding.
[33:28.000 --> 33:32.520]  And then your email goes on to say, and this credible day using technology and
[33:32.520 --> 33:36.320]  software to assist growing cannabis is a no brainer for business and especially
[33:36.320 --> 33:39.560]  when dealing with different state compliance regulations.
[33:39.840 --> 33:43.120]  Yes, it is definitely a no brainer for the business end of it.
[33:43.120 --> 33:44.960]  It's probably a no brainer for my grow end.
[33:44.960 --> 33:51.400]  I do use Google docs for, uh, like sheets of lists of things to do for my grow tax.
[33:51.720 --> 33:52.800]  I use it for scheduling.
[33:52.800 --> 33:53.960]  I use it for nutrient charts.
[33:53.960 --> 33:58.440]  I use it for inventory, but I am not into the computer as much as a
[33:58.440 --> 33:59.640]  lot of the more advanced growers.
[33:59.640 --> 34:00.360]  I'm kind of old school.
[34:00.360 --> 34:02.480]  I guess I keep saying I like pen to paper.
[34:02.560 --> 34:03.480]  That's just my thing.
[34:03.720 --> 34:05.440]  Pencil on paper is my style.
[34:06.040 --> 34:06.880]  Uh, but you're right.
[34:07.120 --> 34:10.440]  Technology and computing is a no brainer for business.
[34:10.920 --> 34:13.880]  My general manager, one of my general managers of the dispensary and I get
[34:13.880 --> 34:18.360]  together and we talk about strains performance is flow living up to our
[34:18.360 --> 34:22.240]  expectations is the testing reaching the numbers we need it to reach is the
[34:22.240 --> 34:24.640]  harvest weight reaching the harvest weight we need it to reach.
[34:24.920 --> 34:27.400]  Is it producing enough per square foot compared to other
[34:27.400 --> 34:28.920]  plants to keep it around here?
[34:29.320 --> 34:32.680]  How many hours are we spending on trimming each strain?
[34:32.880 --> 34:35.200]  Does some strains take way longer to trim than others?
[34:35.440 --> 34:38.240]  How many hours are we spending trimming per pound?
[34:38.240 --> 34:40.000]  What is our cost of trimming per pound?
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.200]  What is our, so there are so many things like that we think about.
[34:42.200 --> 34:42.520]  Yes.
[34:42.840 --> 34:47.880]  Uh, using technology and software is crucial in any business, especially
[34:47.880 --> 34:50.840]  the cannabis business, since it's so new and there's so much to keep track of.
[34:51.080 --> 34:51.760]  And you are correct.
[34:51.760 --> 34:55.880]  Unfortunately, I'm not the dude to ask about that, but I did my best with your
[34:55.880 --> 34:58.880]  question and since you contributed to Patreon and I promised to answer all
[34:58.880 --> 35:01.240]  these Patreon questions, I did my best, dude.
[35:01.240 --> 35:02.520]  I hope I helped you out.
[35:02.880 --> 35:04.560]  I hope I gave you some useful information.
[35:04.560 --> 35:06.160]  Everybody's using metric in Colorado.
[35:06.360 --> 35:09.760]  Just don't make it look like a video game and don't make it hippie themed
[35:09.760 --> 35:12.240]  and Rasta themed, and I think it'll be taken more seriously.
[35:12.560 --> 35:15.880]  The rest of the email says, I was also curious if you'll be attending NCIA's
[35:15.880 --> 35:17.520]  upcoming seed to sale show in Denver.
[35:17.520 --> 35:20.640]  I will be there with the team and I would love to get a chance to meet you.
[35:20.640 --> 35:23.760]  Well, since that was this weekend, no, I did not make that event.
[35:23.760 --> 35:26.160]  I think it was this weekend or the end of this week.
[35:26.160 --> 35:26.720]  I did not make it.
[35:26.720 --> 35:27.640]  It's already passed.
[35:28.120 --> 35:29.200]  Um, man, next time.
[35:29.480 --> 35:31.960]  I don't know if I'll go to the seed to sale show, but let me know next
[35:31.960 --> 35:34.880]  day, the next event you're going to in Denver, and I will try to make it happen.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  Uh, it's fucking snow and still, so I wouldn't have gone this weekend.
[35:38.040 --> 35:38.640]  Either way.
[35:38.680 --> 35:39.800]  I apologize for that.
[35:40.200 --> 35:43.480]  I hands him email with thank you much love and gratitude, dude.
[35:43.840 --> 35:46.960]  Then he signs his name, Michael Patrick Goss, Michael Patrick Goss.
[35:46.960 --> 35:48.000]  Thank you for a great email.
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.080]  Thank you for contributing to the cannabis industry by trying to create a
[35:51.080 --> 35:54.320]  software that is more user-friendly, make it user-friendly, don't make
[35:54.320 --> 35:55.840]  us have to search for tabs.
[35:56.440 --> 35:58.400]  Um, I am an Apple guy.
[35:59.160 --> 36:02.320]  Make it look more like Apple products than Microsoft products.
[36:02.320 --> 36:03.880]  Microsoft products, piss me off.
[36:04.120 --> 36:07.320]  Apple stuff seems to flow, make it flow like an Apple product.
[36:07.320 --> 36:08.160]  That's my advice.
[36:08.560 --> 36:13.120]  Then he says, PS another op awesome topic to bring up again, the concept of donating
[36:13.120 --> 36:17.760]  $4 and 20 cents to advocates like yourself, organizations, and politicians so that
[36:17.760 --> 36:20.480]  they get the signal loud and clear to legalize it.
[36:20.480 --> 36:25.440]  So you guys, I don't know where this started, but for a few months now, there's
[36:25.440 --> 36:28.040]  been a campaign going amongst cannabis.
[36:28.480 --> 36:31.360]  Uh, I don't, I've never, I don't think I've ever heard of it.
[36:31.360 --> 36:34.720]  I've never, I don't think I've ever said that I'm a cannabis activist, but I guess
[36:34.720 --> 36:36.840]  I am, I'm an advocate, I'm a supporter.
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.240]  I am a voice for cannabis, but something going on amongst us, cannabis supporters
[36:41.240 --> 36:46.960]  and advocates is we are trying to get our supporters to contribute to our, uh, our
[36:46.960 --> 36:47.680]  colleagues.
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.600]  So if there's another podcast out there or another cannabis educator or supporter
[36:52.600 --> 36:55.640]  that you wholeheartedly support, I would appreciate it.
[36:55.640 --> 37:00.760]  If you donate $4 and 20 cents to their Patreon campaign and let them know.
[37:01.360 --> 37:04.240]  Why you're doing it, that you're paying it forward from the grow from your heart
[37:04.240 --> 37:04.400]  pot.
[37:04.400 --> 37:05.160]  You don't even mention me.
[37:05.160 --> 37:05.520]  Fuck it.
[37:05.720 --> 37:09.600]  Just say, Hey, I heard that it would be kind to donate $4 and 20 cents to my
[37:09.600 --> 37:14.720]  favorite cannabis, a speaker, lecture, educator, podcaster, musician, whatever
[37:14.720 --> 37:17.920]  they're doing for cannabis, be it normal, be it a podcast.
[37:18.200 --> 37:20.120]  Maybe it's Mary's motivations podcast.
[37:20.120 --> 37:21.520]  Maybe it's the dude grow show.
[37:21.840 --> 37:25.760]  Just go throw down, throw them a $4 and 20 cent contribution and let them know
[37:25.760 --> 37:29.320]  that it's because you support them and you support the legalization of cannabis.
[37:29.320 --> 37:30.840]  If you want to mention my show, that's cool.
[37:30.840 --> 37:32.920]  I'm not asking you to, I don't need the kickback.
[37:32.920 --> 37:36.640]  I don't need the notice, but I think that if my listeners went through four 20 at
[37:36.640 --> 37:40.280]  another place, that would be helpful because I've been getting a lot of $4 and
[37:40.280 --> 37:41.280]  20 cent contributions.
[37:41.280 --> 37:43.240]  So somebody said something about me somewhere.
[37:43.240 --> 37:44.240]  So I'm paying it forward.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.080]  So that is a great idea.
[37:46.560 --> 37:50.920]  Uh, donate $4 and 20 cents to somebody that you feel supports cannabis in a
[37:50.920 --> 37:54.480]  positive light, somebody that you support and that you respect.
[37:55.280 --> 37:55.560]  All right.
[37:55.880 --> 37:59.520]  Then he also says P or PPS, is it PSS or PPS?
[37:59.520 --> 38:00.480]  It's post post-script.
[38:00.920 --> 38:01.520]  PPS.
[38:01.880 --> 38:03.920]  I love the meaning of your brand's name.
[38:03.960 --> 38:06.800]  I read genetics after I heard you explain the meaning of it.
[38:06.800 --> 38:10.680]  I think on a throwback Thursday episode, I was sledding in the snow with my son
[38:10.680 --> 38:13.280]  later that day, smiling wide as I observed him.
[38:14.040 --> 38:17.840]  The silence was only interrupted by the welcoming sound of the calm wind flowing
[38:17.840 --> 38:21.880]  over my ears and the crunch of his boots in the snow, the moment felt phenomenal.
[38:21.960 --> 38:25.040]  Perhaps nothing in the universe could have been better.
[38:25.360 --> 38:25.840]  Irie.
[38:26.720 --> 38:27.240]  Absolutely.
[38:27.240 --> 38:28.040]  That is Irie.
[38:28.080 --> 38:30.040]  You can have an Irie moment at any point in the day.
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.520]  The kids always bring an Irie feeling a little bit of weather and some children
[38:34.560 --> 38:36.160]  will put an Irie feeling in your soul.
[38:36.160 --> 38:39.360]  And if you're not sure what Irie is, Irie means a lot of things, but it's a
[38:39.360 --> 38:41.120]  Jamaican word, it's a patch while word.
[38:42.480 --> 38:45.440]  Irie just means feeling as blessed as you could feel.
[38:45.680 --> 38:47.880]  I describe it as maybe you're on there.
[38:47.880 --> 38:50.040]  There used to be, I grew up in California and there was a park.
[38:50.040 --> 38:51.000]  I know the exact park.
[38:51.000 --> 38:51.920]  It was Crothers park.
[38:52.040 --> 38:53.560]  There's a little hill by the playground.
[38:54.120 --> 38:55.480]  It's a tiny hill, but I was a kid.
[38:55.480 --> 38:56.520]  It looked like a big fucking hill.
[38:56.520 --> 38:59.160]  It was a little grassy hill with a tree at the top of it by the playground.
[38:59.720 --> 39:03.000]  I just lay on my back on that hill and just look up into the clouds.
[39:03.200 --> 39:05.160]  Everybody else was doing, I live in a bad neighborhood.
[39:05.160 --> 39:06.520]  You guys have some fucked up area.
[39:06.800 --> 39:09.320]  Everybody else was out doing bad people, crazy kid shit.
[39:09.680 --> 39:13.320]  I was laying on the grass, staring up into the clouds, just feeling this feeling.
[39:14.120 --> 39:15.960]  I was feeling Irie and I didn't even know it.
[39:16.240 --> 39:19.680]  So when I think about Irie, just think about you're sitting on a grassy hill.
[39:19.680 --> 39:20.960]  The grass is nice and cool.
[39:21.080 --> 39:22.120]  It's like a warm day.
[39:22.160 --> 39:22.960]  The grass is cool.
[39:22.960 --> 39:24.440]  So that grass feels good on your butt.
[39:24.440 --> 39:25.400]  It feels good on your legs.
[39:25.400 --> 39:26.120]  It's just chilling.
[39:26.520 --> 39:27.760]  They feel the earth underneath you.
[39:28.040 --> 39:30.920]  It's like not wet, but it's like cold and soft.
[39:30.920 --> 39:32.480]  And you got that cool grass under your butt.
[39:32.840 --> 39:36.360]  Just enough breeze to not piss you off, but just enough to not make it hot.
[39:36.560 --> 39:37.640]  So you can feel some wind.
[39:37.680 --> 39:39.240]  You know that there's nature and wind.
[39:39.600 --> 39:41.480]  There's a dragonfly flying around over there.
[39:42.040 --> 39:45.200]  The sun is hitting you, but from an angle to where it doesn't even make you squint.
[39:45.440 --> 39:45.960]  Just right.
[39:45.960 --> 39:48.320]  The sun feels just, just beautiful.
[39:48.520 --> 39:49.520]  The sun's kind of setting.
[39:50.040 --> 39:51.200]  So you're sitting in the grass.
[39:51.640 --> 39:53.920]  The sun's kind of setting a little bit of wind.
[39:53.920 --> 39:55.200]  The temperature's fucking perfect.
[39:55.200 --> 39:56.600]  The dragonfly flying over there.
[39:56.600 --> 39:58.000]  Maybe you got your dog next to you.
[39:58.440 --> 39:59.520]  It's nice and peaceful.
[39:59.880 --> 40:04.240]  Nothing in your heart's bugging you and everything just feels, ah, that's fucking
[40:04.320 --> 40:04.840]  iry.
[40:05.360 --> 40:06.360]  That is iry.
[40:07.120 --> 40:08.320]  That's the basic iry.
[40:08.720 --> 40:11.240]  You could be at a reggae concert and you could be feeling that vibe.
[40:11.880 --> 40:12.560]  You're iry.
[40:12.880 --> 40:13.800]  You could be in the car.
[40:14.040 --> 40:16.440]  You only got your arms stretched out on the steering wheel and you lean a little
[40:16.440 --> 40:18.360]  bit into the song and your shoulders do that thing.
[40:18.360 --> 40:19.440]  You are feeling iry.
[40:19.800 --> 40:22.480]  When your hips wobble back and forth to the music, you're feeling iry.
[40:22.720 --> 40:24.000]  Iry can be a lot of things.
[40:24.280 --> 40:28.720]  Iry is the most powerful, most blessed, most fucking great feeling you can feel.
[40:29.080 --> 40:29.480]  Iry.
[40:29.840 --> 40:31.840]  So I call my seed company, Iry Genetics.
[40:32.720 --> 40:33.480]  Iry Genetics.
[40:33.480 --> 40:36.120]  When you consume my cannabis, I feel iry.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  So I'm glad you, I'm glad you enjoy the word iry.
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.480]  I'm glad you appreciate the brand name.
[40:40.880 --> 40:44.600]  And I'm extra glad that you sent me a really long email with two PS's in it.
[40:45.120 --> 40:49.040]  I do apologize that I'm not the tech savvy computer guy that you were hoping for,
[40:49.040 --> 40:52.040]  which seems weird because I run a podcast with all kinds of knobs and buttons here,
[40:52.040 --> 40:53.440]  but they've dumbed this down for us.
[40:53.440 --> 40:57.760]  This is pretty easy at this point, but Michael Patrick Gus, I appreciate you,
[40:57.760 --> 40:57.920]  man.
[40:57.920 --> 41:00.240]  Thanks for trying to make some software for the cannabis industry.
[41:00.240 --> 41:04.000]  I am going to check out your website and then I will have Mike and Greeny check
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.400]  out your website too and see if there's any software there that may help us out
[41:07.400 --> 41:08.920]  at the dispensary or at the grow.
[41:09.120 --> 41:12.760]  And if there's something that helps us, I will talk about that on a future
[41:12.760 --> 41:14.280]  podcast. Ladies and gentlemen,
[41:14.280 --> 41:17.160]  if you'd like to send me an email for me to read it on a future episode,
[41:17.360 --> 41:22.360]  it's really easy. My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[41:22.640 --> 41:25.520]  I would love to hear from you. I would love to read your email on a future episode.
[41:25.520 --> 41:27.960]  I'd love to help you out. Ladies and gentlemen,
[41:27.960 --> 41:30.840]  I've been talking for over 40 minutes. My throat is burning out.
[41:30.840 --> 41:34.280]  My voice is getting dry. I am going to start wrapping up this podcast.
[41:34.280 --> 41:36.560]  Before I do that, I want to give some shout outs here.
[41:36.800 --> 41:39.720]  I want to give a huge shout out to Roger S, Brett C,
[41:39.920 --> 41:44.760]  Kloss V and Michael Zartarian. Thank you guys for the love and support.
[41:44.960 --> 41:46.880]  I appreciate each and every one of you.
[41:47.440 --> 41:50.800]  I have a big stack of emails I need to get through and I've got a bunch more
[41:50.800 --> 41:52.320]  content that I'd like to share with you guys.
[41:52.400 --> 41:55.760]  So I look forward to everybody joining me on the next Monday episode.
[41:55.760 --> 41:58.520]  Just a reminder, I do not know what's going to happen on Thursday.
[41:58.680 --> 42:00.960]  If another episode doesn't come out, don't freak out.
[42:01.040 --> 42:04.200]  Everything is going to be just fine. We'll figure something out real soon.
[42:04.480 --> 42:06.080]  We'll get it going on. I love you guys.
[42:06.240 --> 42:09.040]  I thank you guys for listening to the podcast. Thanks again for all the support,
[42:09.040 --> 42:12.640]  all the interaction, all the messages, emails, all the Instagram love.
[42:12.840 --> 42:13.760]  It means a lot to me.
[42:14.520 --> 42:16.720]  This year has been off to a great start with podcasting,
[42:16.720 --> 42:19.560]  with social media, with my companies. Everything is going great.
[42:19.560 --> 42:23.160]  So big shout out to everybody for supporting me. Who's had my back. Thank you.
[42:23.160 --> 42:26.960]  I fucking see it. It's not going unnoticed. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[42:26.960 --> 42:29.160]  I would appreciate it. If you follow me on all of the social media,
[42:29.160 --> 42:32.560]  check me out on Facebook, simply search for the grow from your heart podcast.
[42:32.560 --> 42:36.040]  Find me on Instagram. It's Irie underscore genetics. We talked about that.
[42:36.040 --> 42:38.520]  You can find me on the Twitter. You can send me some tweets.
[42:38.520 --> 42:40.280]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[42:40.480 --> 42:42.960]  If you've got something to say and you're not into all the social media,
[42:43.120 --> 42:46.360]  simply send me an email. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[42:46.360 --> 42:49.200]  I would love to hear what you've got to say. Like I said earlier,
[42:49.600 --> 42:52.680]  I've got some old episodes up on YouTube and I am working on catching up.
[42:52.680 --> 42:54.760]  You guys, it takes fucking ever to get those videos up there.
[42:54.760 --> 42:56.480]  It takes it like three hours to load a video.
[42:56.640 --> 42:58.880]  I can't do anything else with my computer while that's happening.
[42:59.280 --> 43:02.200]  So that can only happen when I don't need my computer and I've got time to set
[43:02.200 --> 43:04.000]  it up. Usually before I go to work in the morning,
[43:04.040 --> 43:06.800]  I'll set it up to load up a video and then I'll take off and come home and the
[43:06.800 --> 43:09.440]  video will be loaded. But anyway, YouTube videos are coming.
[43:09.520 --> 43:13.000]  I reminded you about Patreon. I would truly appreciate your Patreon support.
[43:13.400 --> 43:15.440]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks,
[43:15.560 --> 43:18.480]  simply go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[43:18.720 --> 43:22.480]  Figure out how to sign up to become a contributor to the podcast.
[43:22.600 --> 43:26.840]  I would appreciate your love and support. If you cannot contribute to Patreon,
[43:26.840 --> 43:29.480]  do not feel bad. Keep listening to the podcast.
[43:29.680 --> 43:31.320]  I still love you just like everybody else.
[43:31.320 --> 43:33.720]  There are a few people out there that are able to contribute.
[43:34.040 --> 43:37.120]  They will cover everybody. Don't worry. Thanks to those folks.
[43:37.240 --> 43:38.400]  Thanks to everybody that listens.
[43:38.400 --> 43:40.840]  If you'd like to show some support without contributing to Patreon,
[43:41.040 --> 43:44.520]  simply go to iTunes, leave me an iTunes rating and an iTunes review.
[43:45.040 --> 43:47.160]  If anything else, just send me an email that says, Hey dude,
[43:47.320 --> 43:51.400]  great fucking show or just keep listening. And I still love you either way.
[43:51.840 --> 43:54.240]  Just do your best to support cannabis in a positive light.
[43:54.400 --> 43:57.880]  Don't be an embarrassing pothead and don't spread false information.
[43:57.880 --> 44:01.480]  And if you see somebody doing something stupid with cannabis in public or in
[44:01.480 --> 44:04.840]  private, point it out to them. Correct that shit. If you're that kind of person,
[44:05.320 --> 44:08.960]  let's make cannabis a mainstream thing that nobody is afraid of anymore.
[44:09.960 --> 44:12.760]  Together. I need your help. All right, you guys,
[44:12.920 --> 44:16.040]  I want to thank everybody for listening to episode 287 of the grow from your
[44:16.200 --> 44:17.680]  heart podcast. It's been a great adventure.
[44:17.800 --> 44:19.560]  I'll be back Monday with brand new content.
[44:20.160 --> 44:23.160]  I want to give a huge shout out to my boy firm deli and until next time,
[44:23.200 --> 44:25.640]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[45:05.280 --> 45:06.600]  He can sound
[45:11.480 --> 45:12.800]  trying to keep her out of sight.
[45:24.720 --> 45:28.240]  I can't find nothing wrong with being friends.
[45:28.240 --> 45:29.760]  Cause sometimes
[45:36.280 --> 45:37.280]  nothing wrong with
[45:42.080 --> 45:42.920]  something wrong with her.
