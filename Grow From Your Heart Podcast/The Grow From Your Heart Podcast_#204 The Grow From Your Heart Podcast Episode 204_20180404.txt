[00:01.790 --> 00:03.870]  Yo, what's up podcast world?
[00:03.870 --> 00:04.870]  It's Rasta Jeff.
[00:04.870 --> 00:06.570]  I'm back with a chunk of old episodes.
[00:06.570 --> 00:11.830]  This time we're doing episodes 32, 33, 34, and 35 of what used to be known as the I Grow
[00:11.830 --> 00:15.850]  Culture podcast, currently known as the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:15.850 --> 00:19.570]  This file is going to be really long, so I'll keep this intro short.
[00:19.570 --> 00:21.350]  All of the social media stuff has been updated.
[00:21.350 --> 00:22.850]  I would love it if you follow me on Twitter.
[00:22.850 --> 00:24.310]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[00:24.310 --> 00:25.530]  You can find me on Facebook.
[00:25.530 --> 00:27.330]  It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:27.330 --> 00:28.750]  And you can send me an email.
[00:28.750 --> 00:34.250]  The correct and updated email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[00:34.250 --> 00:35.250]  I would love to hear from you.
[00:35.250 --> 00:41.310]  Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, here are episodes 32, 33, 34, and 35 of what
[00:41.310 --> 00:44.310]  used to be the I Grow Culture podcast.
[00:44.310 --> 00:54.010]  Yeah, what's up ladies and gentlemen?
[00:54.010 --> 01:04.410]  It's time for episode number 32 of the I Grow Culture podcast.
[01:04.410 --> 01:05.410]  It's your host Rasta Jeff.
[01:05.410 --> 01:06.410]  Joining me today on the mic, we've got our buddy Adam with us.
[01:06.410 --> 01:07.410]  How are you doing, bro?
[01:07.410 --> 01:08.410]  I'm good, man.
[01:08.410 --> 01:09.410]  What's up with you?
[01:09.410 --> 01:10.410]  Hanging out, bro.
[01:10.410 --> 01:11.410]  Taking some dabs.
[01:11.410 --> 01:12.410]  I want to give a big shout out to our buddy Mike.
[01:12.410 --> 01:13.410]  Mike was supposed to come join us on the show today, but Mike, he hurt himself.
[01:13.410 --> 01:14.410]  He hurt his back, so he's laid up.
[01:14.410 --> 01:15.410]  He's taking a night off.
[01:15.410 --> 01:16.410]  Big shout out to Mike.
[01:16.410 --> 01:17.410]  Good feeling better, man.
[01:17.410 --> 01:18.410]  Get well, bro.
[01:18.410 --> 01:19.410]  We'll take care of you.
[01:19.410 --> 01:20.410]  I'll see you on the show.
[01:20.410 --> 01:21.410]  Bye.
[01:21.410 --> 01:22.410]  I'm going to go ahead and turn it back over to Mike.
[01:22.410 --> 01:23.410]  Good feeling better, man.
[01:23.410 --> 01:24.410]  Get well, bro.
[01:24.410 --> 01:25.410]  We'll take some dabs for you.
[01:25.410 --> 01:32.450]  Also, on the last episode, I said that I was going to make videos of this podcast.
[01:32.450 --> 01:35.610]  Making a video is a big pain in the ass and it really detracts from the quality of the
[01:35.610 --> 01:36.610]  show in my opinion.
[01:36.610 --> 01:38.890]  I was too distracted by toys and equipment.
[01:38.890 --> 01:41.770]  I wasn't able to make a good podcast.
[01:41.770 --> 01:44.330]  So I've decided to not make videos of the show.
[01:44.330 --> 01:50.170]  What I will do is keep making cheesy ass YouTube videos with iMovie and just put up videos
[01:50.170 --> 01:51.170]  that are mostly still shots.
[01:51.170 --> 01:55.210]  There'll be some video in there, but it'll mostly be stills of stuff that is involved
[01:55.210 --> 01:56.210]  in the podcast.
[01:56.210 --> 02:00.570]  I'll take pictures of rigs, pictures of plants, pictures of the guests, pictures of myself.
[02:00.570 --> 02:04.010]  It'll be stuff like that because doing a video really wasn't very fun.
[02:04.010 --> 02:05.650]  I'm going to fade out this music here.
[02:05.650 --> 02:07.810]  Big shout out to Cat and Coot and the Mystic Roots Band.
[02:07.810 --> 02:09.290]  Thanks for letting me play your music on the show.
[02:09.290 --> 02:10.290]  Really appreciate it.
[02:10.290 --> 02:14.570]  Make sure you guys follow the Mystic Roots Band.
[02:14.570 --> 02:16.810]  Speaking of putting pictures of rigs up, man.
[02:16.810 --> 02:17.810]  Oh.
[02:17.810 --> 02:19.810]  Yeah, I got a new rig today.
[02:20.450 --> 02:25.490]  Big shout out to at LSD Gallery on Instagram and also big shout out to at Slugworth.
[02:25.490 --> 02:26.490]  I think it's Slugworth Glass.
[02:26.490 --> 02:29.410]  I should have researched that, but check out Slugworth Glass, whatever they're called on
[02:29.410 --> 02:30.410]  Instagram.
[02:30.410 --> 02:33.890]  I will tweet a link to that so you can find them.
[02:33.890 --> 02:37.290]  I ordered the Master Shake Rig from LSD Gallery.
[02:37.290 --> 02:42.730]  It's a little smaller than I expected, but boy, do I approve.
[02:42.730 --> 02:46.370]  Came with this super awesome chainsaw dabber here.
[02:46.370 --> 02:49.970]  I think this little handle here, they're encouraging me to wear this as a pendant is
[02:49.970 --> 02:51.730]  what I think is happening.
[02:51.730 --> 02:55.010]  And this rig is certainly designed to be worn as a pendant.
[02:55.010 --> 02:57.810]  This thing, I think Adam said, what is that, three inches tall?
[02:57.810 --> 02:58.810]  About three inches.
[02:58.810 --> 02:59.810]  I would agree.
[02:59.810 --> 03:01.850]  That's about three inches tall, bro.
[03:01.850 --> 03:03.330]  So I'm super satisfied.
[03:03.330 --> 03:06.770]  If you guys are looking for good glass that will get shipped to you at a reasonable price
[03:06.770 --> 03:08.530]  from good people that do good business.
[03:08.530 --> 03:09.530]  It's thick.
[03:09.530 --> 03:11.330]  The glass is thicker than it looks like it's going to be.
[03:11.330 --> 03:12.570]  Yeah, it's nice and heavy.
[03:12.570 --> 03:15.370]  It's not clear, so you can't see the thickness of the glass.
[03:15.370 --> 03:19.330]  But if you look at the straw and see even like the handles and stuff, it is thick.
[03:19.330 --> 03:21.050]  And once you handle it, you...
[03:21.050 --> 03:26.210]  Yeah, this Master Shake Rig is stylish, super stylish, well worth every penny I spent.
[03:26.210 --> 03:27.890]  It got shipped here super quickly.
[03:27.890 --> 03:29.930]  It went out the day after I paid for it.
[03:29.930 --> 03:31.330]  I paid for it on Sunday.
[03:31.330 --> 03:33.930]  I got a tracking number when I woke up Monday morning.
[03:33.930 --> 03:35.810]  So if you need glass, check them out.
[03:35.810 --> 03:38.570]  They're called at LSD Gallery.
[03:38.570 --> 03:39.570]  They're pretty fresh.
[03:39.570 --> 03:44.290]  Also, a big shout out to TaskRock because when I ordered my new rig, of course I had
[03:44.290 --> 03:45.290]  to get...
[03:45.290 --> 03:46.370]  It's a little 10 millimeter rig.
[03:46.370 --> 03:47.730]  It's my first 10 mil.
[03:47.730 --> 03:52.010]  I like the bigger stuff, honestly, but this little one is cute and I love the way it hits.
[03:52.010 --> 03:53.010]  This will be my new...
[03:53.010 --> 03:55.690]  Just when I'm dabbing by myself, that'll be my new personal rig.
[03:55.690 --> 03:56.690]  Shout out to Task.
[03:56.690 --> 04:03.010]  I got myself a purple carb cap and a little 10 millimeter Trinity nail to put on my rig
[04:03.010 --> 04:04.970]  and it works perfectly.
[04:04.970 --> 04:05.970]  Love it.
[04:05.970 --> 04:06.970]  Satisfied.
[04:06.970 --> 04:08.490]  Much respect.
[04:08.490 --> 04:12.450]  At LSD Gallery and at TaskRock and at Slugworth Glass.
[04:12.450 --> 04:14.490]  I'll have to research the Slugworth one.
[04:14.490 --> 04:16.210]  And at Highly Educated Titanium.
[04:16.210 --> 04:17.370]  Highly Educated Titanium.
[04:17.370 --> 04:18.530]  Make sure you check those guys out.
[04:18.530 --> 04:20.770]  Well, now that you're there, let's just do this.

[04:25.370 --> 04:28.450]  If you're using high quality concentrates like I know most of you are, you deserve a
[04:28.450 --> 04:31.810]  high quality titanium nail made in America.
[04:31.810 --> 04:35.110]  Don't trust the Chinese knockoff or an American knockoff.
[04:35.110 --> 04:37.090]  You don't want that crap that's made out of cheap metals.
[04:37.090 --> 04:38.370]  Trust an industry leader.

[04:47.730 --> 04:48.730]  You can tell him your ideas.
[04:48.730 --> 04:49.730]  You can tell him thanks.
[04:49.730 --> 04:50.730]  It's somebody that we know.
[04:50.730 --> 04:52.250]  Someone that's part of this industry.
[04:52.250 --> 04:55.130]  So big love, much respect to Highly Educated Titanium.
[04:55.130 --> 04:58.610]  If you want your own Highly Educated Titanium products, you can check out our friends at

[05:07.050 --> 05:09.710]  They've got a lot of great, highly educated stuff in stock.
[05:09.710 --> 05:15.270]  If you're in Colorado, this place does not pay me, but dude, go check out Illusion's
[05:15.270 --> 05:18.630]  Glass on Broadway.
[05:18.630 --> 05:19.630]  We need to take...
[05:19.630 --> 05:20.630]  Adam hasn't been there.
[05:20.630 --> 05:21.630]  I feel bad.
[05:21.630 --> 05:23.470]  We've gone to Denver several times together, and I have not taken you to Illusion's.
[05:23.470 --> 05:24.470]  We got to do that.
[05:24.470 --> 05:27.950]  And I'm probably in the market of purchasing a rig, so I may need a nail.
[05:27.950 --> 05:28.950]  There you go.
[05:28.950 --> 05:31.470]  I was going to ask you earlier where I can pick one up.
[05:31.470 --> 05:34.670]  Illusion's Glass in Denver does carry highly educated products.
[05:34.670 --> 05:35.670]  Next time we go down...
[05:35.670 --> 05:36.670]  They have all kinds of sick glass.
[05:36.670 --> 05:37.670]  It's not just a glass shop.
[05:37.670 --> 05:38.670]  It's a gallery.
[05:38.670 --> 05:39.670]  That sounds like a written commercial.
[05:40.630 --> 05:41.630]  Oh, no.
[05:41.630 --> 05:42.630]  That sounds fun.
[05:42.630 --> 05:43.630]  It's fucking awesome.
[05:43.630 --> 05:44.630]  Yeah.
[05:44.630 --> 05:45.630]  Dude, I owe a dollar because I just said the F word again.
[05:45.630 --> 05:46.630]  You guys get me on that.
[05:46.630 --> 05:47.630]  Oh.
[05:47.630 --> 05:50.670]  Starting on episode 30, every time I say the F word, I owe a dollar, and you guys are going
[05:50.670 --> 05:51.670]  to hold me to that.
[05:51.670 --> 05:52.670]  Yep.
[05:52.670 --> 05:53.670]  To a charity.
[05:53.670 --> 05:55.670]  By the time we get to episode 35, I'll start doing $5 every time.
[05:55.670 --> 05:56.670]  All right.
[05:56.670 --> 05:57.670]  Yeah.
[05:57.670 --> 05:58.670]  So I'm going to stop saying the F word.
[05:58.670 --> 05:59.670]  It slipped by me.
[05:59.670 --> 06:00.670]  Yeah.
[06:00.670 --> 06:01.670]  I'll be more...
[06:01.670 --> 06:03.070]  There are some listeners that it does not slip by, so thank you guys for listening and
[06:03.070 --> 06:06.150]  making some money for the person that's sick that actually needs some money.
[06:06.150 --> 06:07.150]  It's a good way to do it.
[06:07.150 --> 06:08.550]  It's a great way to do it.
[06:08.550 --> 06:12.230]  Make sure you guys follow Task Rock on Instagram and Twitter.
[06:12.230 --> 06:14.150]  It's at Task Rock.

[06:18.150 --> 06:19.150]  It's all one word, Task Rock.
[06:19.150 --> 06:20.150]  All right.
[06:20.150 --> 06:22.150]  Sorry, I'm fixing some sound levels here.
[06:22.150 --> 06:23.150]  I'm not happy with something.
[06:23.150 --> 06:24.150]  I got it.
[06:24.150 --> 06:25.150]  I figured out that knob right there.
[06:25.150 --> 06:26.150]  I'm picky, dude.
[06:26.150 --> 06:27.150]  It's all good.
[06:27.150 --> 06:28.150]  I'll turn up my headphones.
[06:28.150 --> 06:29.150]  You got to do what you got to do.
[06:29.150 --> 06:30.150]  Solve everything.
[06:30.150 --> 06:31.150]  Just turn up the headphones.

[07:57.270 --> 08:00.270]  I read your Facebook about your adventures that you're going to take off on.
[08:00.270 --> 08:01.270]  You're going to go on a travel.
[08:01.870 --> 08:03.510]  You hopefully are going to end up in South America.

[08:22.870 --> 08:23.870]  Hope you guys have a good time together.
[08:23.870 --> 08:24.870]  All right.
[08:24.870 --> 08:28.630]  So bro, you want to take a quick dab and then we will read some news.
[08:28.630 --> 08:29.630]  For sure.
[08:29.710 --> 08:34.470]  Guys, if you want to follow the show on Instagram or on Twitter, it's at I Grow Culture.
[08:34.470 --> 08:37.750]  If you want to follow our guest, he is at Overgrow the Gov.
[08:37.750 --> 08:39.110]  Sorry, I stumbled on that one.
[08:39.110 --> 08:40.590]  At Overgrow the Gov.
[08:40.590 --> 08:42.790]  You can find him on Twitter and Instagram.
[08:42.790 --> 08:43.790]  You can find me.
[08:43.790 --> 08:50.390]  I'm at RastaJeff420 on Twitter or you can follow at IryGenetics on Instagram and Twitter.
[08:50.390 --> 08:51.390]  I post a lot of stuff there.
[08:51.390 --> 08:54.430]  I know that's a lot of social media stuff, but that gives you some stuff to follow.
[08:54.430 --> 08:57.310]  If you're listening to the podcast, if you're killing time, you can look at at Overgrow
[08:57.310 --> 08:59.510]  the Gov, see the pictures he's posting.
[08:59.590 --> 09:03.070]  You can look at IryGenetics and see the weed plants I post.
[09:03.070 --> 09:07.270]  You can look at at I Grow Culture and see a bunch of cannabinoid profile charts and
[09:07.270 --> 09:08.270]  stuff like that.
[09:08.270 --> 09:09.630]  Lots of stuff to check out.
[09:09.630 --> 09:16.230]  Also, I encourage you heavily to check out the forum on IryGeneticsColorado.com.
[09:16.230 --> 09:19.310]  I've got a forum there that is my website.
[09:19.310 --> 09:21.070]  You won't be censored unless you're a shit talker.
[09:21.070 --> 09:22.870]  I try to let everybody have freedom of speech.
[09:22.870 --> 09:23.870]  You can say what you want.
[09:23.870 --> 09:24.870]  It's not like Facebook.
[09:24.870 --> 09:26.750]  I'm not going to go and take down your stuff.
[09:26.750 --> 09:28.950]  I'm not going to make you use your real name.
[09:29.390 --> 09:30.910]  Facebook has been censoring people lately.
[09:30.910 --> 09:35.390]  Facebook has been taking down accounts that have fake names or not even fake names, just
[09:35.390 --> 09:36.390]  pseudonames.
[09:36.390 --> 09:39.270]  If I disappear off of Facebook, find me on the forum.
[09:39.270 --> 09:40.510]  Come join my forum.
[09:40.510 --> 09:43.230]  I'll answer all of your grow questions there.
[09:43.230 --> 09:45.550]  I've got a nice community of friends that are there.
[09:45.550 --> 09:46.550]  We post up our pictures.
[09:46.550 --> 09:47.790]  We post stuff about our gardens.
[09:47.790 --> 09:49.750]  I've been posting the notes from the podcast.
[09:49.750 --> 09:53.290]  If I type something out, like a long note, I'll actually put it there on the forum so
[09:53.290 --> 09:54.290]  people can check it out.
[09:54.290 --> 09:56.030]  I encourage you to interact with us.
[09:56.030 --> 09:57.290]  I love interaction.
[09:57.290 --> 09:58.290]  Of course, there's Facebook.
[09:58.630 --> 09:59.630]  I grow culture on Facebook.
[09:59.630 --> 10:02.630]  Yeah, it sounds like I'm just plugging the show again.
[10:02.630 --> 10:05.210]  We're going to take a quick dab and then we will be back for the news.
[10:05.210 --> 10:06.810]  While we take dabs, I'm just going to turn up the music.
[10:06.810 --> 10:10.330]  I got some Mystic Roots Band playing.
[10:10.330 --> 10:13.330]  I think this is $100 bag.
[10:13.330 --> 10:14.330]  I think so.
[10:14.330 --> 10:15.330]  I think it's $100 bag.
[10:15.330 --> 10:16.330]  Yeah, we're going to take a dab real quick while this plays.
[10:16.330 --> 10:17.330]  Enjoy, guys.
[10:17.330 --> 10:18.330]  We'll leave the mics on so you can hear Adam Coss.
[10:18.330 --> 10:19.330]  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[10:19.330 --> 10:20.330]  Speaking of which, I got to say a big shout out to Bender.
[10:20.330 --> 10:21.330]  He's a great guy.
[10:21.330 --> 10:22.330]  He's a great guy.
[10:22.330 --> 10:23.330]  He's a great guy.
[10:23.330 --> 10:24.330]  He's a great guy.
[10:24.330 --> 10:25.330]  He's a great guy.
[10:25.330 --> 10:26.330]  He's a great guy.
[10:26.370 --> 10:31.650]  I got to say a big shout out to Bender and 420th.com.
[10:31.650 --> 10:36.970]  They've been doing it while I'm away and held it down while I couldn't be on the internet
[10:36.970 --> 10:38.770]  and stuff like that.
[10:38.770 --> 10:40.930]  Big shout out to you guys.
[10:40.930 --> 10:44.570]  All the people back out east, we do not care.
[10:44.570 --> 10:47.570]  Murphysboro, you know who you are, man.
[10:47.570 --> 10:48.570]  Thanks for listening.
[10:48.570 --> 10:55.170]  Half of the guys from the 420th just found out that I've been on.
[10:55.170 --> 10:57.170]  They just thought I was spamming your podcast.
[10:57.170 --> 11:02.610]  It's like, man, pay attention.
[11:02.610 --> 11:03.890]  I was stoned when I wrote it.
[11:03.890 --> 11:06.890]  It should make a little bit of sense at least.
[11:06.890 --> 11:07.890]  All right.
[11:07.890 --> 11:08.890]  Here we go.
[11:08.890 --> 11:09.890]  The Chokefest.
[11:09.890 --> 11:14.170]  I owe a big shout out to Bender as well.
[11:14.170 --> 11:15.650]  Bender, if you're listening, thanks, bro.
[11:15.650 --> 11:19.170]  You made me three logos and all three of them look sweet as shit.
[11:19.170 --> 11:20.770]  I appreciate it.
[11:20.770 --> 11:21.770]  Keep them coming, bro.
[11:21.770 --> 11:22.770]  Keep them coming.
[11:22.770 --> 11:23.770]  We'll give you more shout outs on the show.
[11:23.770 --> 11:24.770]  It's the best I can do for now.
[11:25.370 --> 11:27.370]  But in the long run, we'll make it up to you.
[11:27.370 --> 11:28.370]  We'll make it worth it.
[11:28.370 --> 11:29.370]  I appreciate it.
[11:29.370 --> 11:30.370]  He's a cool dude.
[11:30.370 --> 11:31.370]  I didn't ask for anything.
[11:31.370 --> 11:34.770]  He just volunteered and made me some pretty cool iRegenetics logos.
[11:34.770 --> 11:38.370]  Dude, how about an iGrowCulture logo that I can make a sticker out of?
[11:38.370 --> 11:39.370]  There we go.
[11:39.370 --> 11:42.370]  I'll put the request in.
[11:42.370 --> 11:44.370]  I'll just tell him that he should listen to the show.
[11:44.370 --> 11:45.370]  Don't even tell him.
[11:45.370 --> 11:46.370]  Just tell him if he listens.
[11:46.370 --> 11:47.370]  We'll find out.
[11:47.370 --> 11:48.370]  We'll find out.
[11:48.370 --> 11:50.370]  That music was loud while we were talking.
[11:50.970 --> 11:54.970]  We're taking some dabs and stuff blasted by my good buddy at Garden of Weeden.
[11:54.970 --> 12:00.970]  Follow Garden of Weeden on Instagram.
[12:00.970 --> 12:03.970]  Sorry, I'm coughing after a dab.
[12:03.970 --> 12:07.970]  Guys, I hope you're taking dabs with us while we're dabbing on the show.
[12:10.970 --> 12:12.970]  Using those highly educated nails.
[12:12.970 --> 12:13.970]  Yeah.
[12:13.970 --> 12:16.970]  That's some tasty stuff.
[12:16.970 --> 12:17.970]  Isn't that tasty?
[12:17.970 --> 12:19.970]  I think it's some golden goat.
[12:20.570 --> 12:24.570]  I'd say hitman rig because hitting that little mini slugworth would just make us cough for an hour on the show.
[12:24.570 --> 12:26.570]  Big shout out to those guys.
[12:26.570 --> 12:28.570]  Which guys?
[12:28.570 --> 12:29.570]  The Garden of Weeden.
[12:29.570 --> 12:31.570]  I think that's what I was just saying.
[12:31.570 --> 12:35.570]  You said we were doing that.
[12:35.570 --> 12:37.570]  Big shout out to Garden of Weeden.
[12:37.570 --> 12:38.570]  I slipped.
[12:38.570 --> 12:39.570]  You were in a dab world.
[12:39.570 --> 12:40.570]  That's okay.
[12:40.570 --> 12:41.570]  You had that dab bubble around your head.
[12:41.570 --> 12:42.570]  Adam's going to be alright, guys.
[12:42.570 --> 12:43.570]  We'll just give him a minute to catch up.
[12:43.570 --> 12:44.570]  You there?
[12:44.570 --> 12:45.570]  No, I'm here.
[12:45.570 --> 12:46.570]  You good?
[12:46.570 --> 12:47.570]  Yep.
[12:47.570 --> 12:48.570]  You good?
[12:49.170 --> 12:51.170]  If you think it'll make the podcast better.
[12:51.170 --> 12:52.170]  That could be fun.
[12:52.170 --> 12:53.170]  We're sitting here with...
[12:53.170 --> 12:54.170]  Can I sit here?
[12:54.170 --> 12:55.170]  Yeah, sure.
[12:55.170 --> 12:58.170]  Miss G, we're sitting here with your son and he's dabbed the fuck out.
[12:58.170 --> 13:00.170]  I was wondering if you could just talk him down a little bit.
[13:00.170 --> 13:06.170]  Well, the thing is I'll sit here and I'll encourage people like, yeah, go follow and troll the shit out of her on Facebook.
[13:06.170 --> 13:08.170]  But I don't really care.
[13:08.170 --> 13:10.170]  You want people to troll your mom?
[13:10.170 --> 13:11.170]  It's whatever.
[13:11.170 --> 13:12.170]  That'd be funny.
[13:12.170 --> 13:13.170]  It would be.
[13:13.170 --> 13:16.170]  My mom doesn't have any social media and I'm glad about it.
[13:16.170 --> 13:18.170]  I'm pretty glad about it.
[13:18.770 --> 13:19.770]  Guys, we're just rambling.
[13:19.770 --> 13:21.770]  We're having a personal conversation because we just took dabs.
[13:21.770 --> 13:26.770]  I'd rather talk, have just some rambles that are incoherent instead of trying to read the news while I'm choking over here.
[13:26.770 --> 13:27.770]  A little intermission.
[13:27.770 --> 13:32.770]  So, this is going to go up probably Monday, I think.
[13:32.770 --> 13:34.770]  Yeah, it should go up Monday morning.
[13:34.770 --> 13:37.770]  How'd you guys like that bonus little miniature episode that I put out Thursday night?
[13:37.770 --> 13:38.770]  Was that cool or what?
[13:38.770 --> 13:41.770]  I've been trying to catch up.
[13:41.770 --> 13:42.770]  It's going to go out tonight.
[13:42.770 --> 13:45.770]  There's one, as we're recording, I'll post another one when we finish.
[13:45.770 --> 13:46.770]  I know.
[13:47.370 --> 13:49.370]  I'm getting ahead of myself.
[13:49.370 --> 13:50.370]  This is on Monday.
[13:50.370 --> 13:51.370]  I'm living in the future.
[13:51.370 --> 13:52.370]  You're living in the future?
[13:52.370 --> 13:53.370]  Yeah.
[13:53.370 --> 13:54.370]  Alright.
[13:54.370 --> 13:55.370]  I'm going to live in the now.
[13:55.370 --> 14:05.370]  Guys, if you've got social media, if you've got Facebook, if you've got Twitter, if you've got YouTube, if you've watched TV in the past couple of days, you have seen the anchor lady.
[14:05.370 --> 14:07.370]  Guys, excuse my dollar on this one.
[14:07.370 --> 14:09.370]  Come on, don't charge me a dollar for this one.
[14:09.370 --> 14:15.370]  This lady went on TV and she made a nice long speech and her speech ended with, fuck it, I quit.
[14:15.970 --> 14:17.970]  You guys know who I'm talking about, right?
[14:17.970 --> 14:18.970]  I'm going to read an R.
[14:18.970 --> 14:19.970]  I wonder if I can play the video.
[14:19.970 --> 14:20.970]  Can I play the video and not get in trouble?
[14:20.970 --> 14:21.970]  It's on.
[14:21.970 --> 14:22.970]  It's from the news.
[14:22.970 --> 14:24.970]  Yeah, I mean, the news played the hell out of it.
[14:24.970 --> 14:25.970]  They didn't get permission.
[14:25.970 --> 14:26.970]  Well, maybe they did.
[14:26.970 --> 14:34.970]  Let's turn down the music and let's try to play this video because I'm going to play a quick video and you guys, this happened on the news and then I'll read the story.
[14:36.970 --> 14:39.970]  Now, everything you've heard is why I, the actual owner.
[14:39.970 --> 14:40.970]  Oh, it sounds like shit.
[14:40.970 --> 14:41.970]  I'm not even going to play it.
[14:41.970 --> 14:42.970]  Sorry.
[14:42.970 --> 14:43.970]  Well.
[14:43.970 --> 14:44.970]  Shit, give me a second, guys.
[14:45.570 --> 14:47.570]  I'm going to search for the actual good quality video and I'll play it for you.
[14:47.570 --> 14:48.570]  Hold on.
[14:48.570 --> 14:49.570]  I owe you that much.
[14:49.570 --> 14:50.570]  Give me a second.
[14:50.570 --> 14:51.570]  All right, guys, I'm back.
[14:51.570 --> 14:52.570]  I did a little bit of searching.
[14:52.570 --> 14:54.570]  The video comes in kind of late.
[14:54.570 --> 14:55.570]  I should fill you in a little bit.
[14:55.570 --> 15:02.570]  This lady, the news ran a report about medical cannabis or cannabis in Alaska and this lady was reporting on it.
[15:02.570 --> 15:12.570]  And then during her report, she states that she supports cannabis and that she actually is the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club.
[15:13.170 --> 15:16.170]  So this is kind of where just to pick, get you up to speed.
[15:16.170 --> 15:21.170]  So that's where she jumps in and I'll play the video now and hopefully they don't take it off of all of the servers.
[15:21.170 --> 15:32.170]  Now, everything you've heard is why I, the actual owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, will be dedicating all of my energy toward fighting for freedom and fairness, which begins with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska.
[15:32.170 --> 15:37.170]  And as for this job, well, not that I have a choice, but fuck it.
[15:37.170 --> 15:38.170]  I quit.
[15:40.170 --> 15:42.170]  So you heard it right there.
[15:42.770 --> 15:47.770]  And then the next lady on the news, they screw up, the camera pops back up to the other lady on the news.
[15:47.770 --> 15:50.770]  And this lady, the other co-host, looks like she pissed her pants when she said that.
[15:50.770 --> 15:56.770]  But so this lady goes on the news and she's a news reporter and you heard it right there.
[15:56.770 --> 15:59.770]  She just said, fuck it, I quit live on the news.
[15:59.770 --> 16:00.770]  So I'm going to get into the article.
[16:00.770 --> 16:02.770]  It'll make a little more sense.
[16:02.770 --> 16:03.770]  Fuck it, I quit.
[16:03.770 --> 16:05.770]  Anchor explains her dramatic exit.
[16:05.770 --> 16:07.770]  And guys, don't charge me a dollar for all of these.
[16:07.770 --> 16:08.770]  It's in the article.
[16:08.770 --> 16:10.770]  I'm just relaying the news.
[16:11.370 --> 16:13.370]  Did I read who it's by?
[16:13.370 --> 16:14.370]  I don't know if I said who it's by.
[16:14.370 --> 16:18.370]  It's by Molly Riley from the Huffington Post.
[16:18.370 --> 16:25.370]  I think I'm going to get me a dirty, nasty, recycled jar to bring over here and sit on your table during these podcasts.
[16:25.370 --> 16:26.370]  Just for...
[16:26.370 --> 16:28.370]  Yeah, just so you feel dirty, even dirty.
[16:28.370 --> 16:31.370]  And you have to put it like, you have to stick it to the bottom of the jar.
[16:31.370 --> 16:33.370]  The F-hit jar.
[16:33.370 --> 16:34.370]  The F-jar.
[16:34.970 --> 16:35.970]  Alright, so it says,
[16:35.970 --> 16:36.970]  A local news...
[16:36.970 --> 16:43.970]  The local news anchor who had dramatically quit her job on air following a segment on marijuana explained her exit in a YouTube video released Monday.
[16:43.970 --> 16:53.970]  Charlo Green, a reporter for Anchorage's KTVA announced on air that she would be leaving her job at the TV station to focus on marijuana legalization in Alaska.
[16:53.970 --> 16:56.970]  So, like I said, they ran the clip about cannabis.
[16:56.970 --> 16:57.970]  And then she says this,
[16:58.570 --> 17:08.570]  Everything you've heard is why I, the actual owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, will be dedicating all of my energy toward fighting for freedom and fairness, which begins with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska, she said.
[17:08.570 --> 17:13.570]  And as for this job, well, not that I have a choice, but fuck it, I quit.
[17:13.570 --> 17:15.570]  So that's where she stirred up a lot of controversy.
[17:16.170 --> 17:28.170]  She, in my opinion, the attention should have been on her advocacy, her support, and her fight to legalize and support cannabis.
[17:28.170 --> 17:35.170]  Instead, she chose one wrong word on the air on TV and distracted it from all of what she was trying to do.
[17:35.170 --> 17:39.170]  She said the word that cost me a dollar on the air, on TV.
[17:39.170 --> 17:43.170]  So that, Adam pointed it out that that TV station is going to face a fine.
[17:43.770 --> 17:48.770]  The FCC is going to do something, even if it was early morning and there was very small numbers.
[17:48.770 --> 17:51.770]  Yeah, that looks like a normal.
[17:51.770 --> 17:56.770]  The FCC goes from like $2,500 to like $250,000.
[17:56.770 --> 17:58.770]  She'll probably end up paying the fine. Can they fine her?
[17:58.770 --> 18:00.770]  They may be able to do it.
[18:00.770 --> 18:01.770]  But still, that was rude.
[18:01.770 --> 18:06.770]  And her choice of words distracted from her whole fight. It made her kind of look bad.
[18:06.770 --> 18:12.770]  She could have quit on air and probably sent a better message, but it wouldn't have been heard.
[18:13.370 --> 18:14.370]  It wouldn't have been heard so broadly.
[18:14.370 --> 18:17.370]  It would not have been heard by the non-Hawke community.
[18:17.370 --> 18:19.370]  Since everybody has seen this on...
[18:19.370 --> 18:24.370]  The day it happened, I opened up my Facebook and it was all anybody had posted all day.
[18:24.370 --> 18:30.370]  So apparently she got herself popular the way she was trying to do, but she could have done a little bit better of a job.
[18:30.370 --> 18:32.370]  But then there's also the...
[18:32.370 --> 18:40.370]  I'm not saying that the marijuana business is going to fail, but maybe she hits a snafu and it kind of crumbles from underneath her.
[18:40.970 --> 18:43.970]  Maybe she trusts the wrong partner or there's some kind of illegal...
[18:43.970 --> 18:46.970]  There's all kinds of things that could happen.
[18:46.970 --> 18:49.970]  And from here on out, she's never getting a reporting job again.
[18:49.970 --> 18:50.970]  Oh no.
[18:50.970 --> 18:55.970]  You're never getting on any kind of cable access, let alone making a comedy show.
[18:55.970 --> 18:56.970]  Maybe that.
[18:56.970 --> 18:58.970]  She can come on our podcast whenever she'd like.
[18:58.970 --> 19:00.970]  Oh, there you go. There's the open invitation.
[19:00.970 --> 19:01.970]  Yeah.
[19:01.970 --> 19:02.970]  All right. I'll keep going with the article.
[19:02.970 --> 19:08.970]  In the YouTube clip, Green explained why she believes the fight for marijuana legalization in her home state is so important.
[19:09.570 --> 19:15.570]  There comes a time in each and every one of our lives where we must choose to continue to spectate or stand up for what's right, she said.
[19:15.570 --> 19:20.570]  Why are Americans arrested every 30 seconds, Alaskans every 4.3 hours?
[19:20.570 --> 19:26.570]  Why should an aspiring someone lose their ability to earn a higher education to become someone they were not meant to be?
[19:26.570 --> 19:31.570]  And why should you lose the ability to get public assistance in times of struggle and need?
[19:32.570 --> 19:36.570]  She continued, advocating for freedom and fairness should be everybody's duty.
[19:37.170 --> 19:43.170]  I'm making it my life work to uphold what America stands for truly, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[19:43.170 --> 19:45.170]  Ideals now need to be defended.
[19:47.170 --> 19:48.170]  I kind of agree with her there.
[19:48.170 --> 19:50.170]  I agree with her.
[19:50.170 --> 19:56.170]  But as I've been told numerous times throughout my life, it's not what you do, it's how you do it.
[19:57.170 --> 20:05.170]  And as hearing it over and over again is, you shouldn't have said F, you shouldn't have said fuck, you shouldn't have said this.
[20:05.770 --> 20:06.770]  I hear it constantly.
[20:06.770 --> 20:12.770]  But if that's the type of person who you are and you're able to stand up to that scrutiny, I'll back that.
[20:13.770 --> 20:18.770]  I'm not the type of person to bite my tongue, especially if you cross me and I felt like I haven't done anything wrong.
[20:20.770 --> 20:24.770]  So if they were going to fire her, fuck that company.
[20:25.770 --> 20:26.770]  100%.
[20:26.770 --> 20:29.770]  They weren't going to fire her until she said that she owned that cannabis club.
[20:29.770 --> 20:30.770]  Why then?
[20:30.770 --> 20:31.770]  She was legit anyway.
[20:31.770 --> 20:33.770]  She's got a backup job, so she could have just said.
[20:34.370 --> 20:37.370]  That's probably my last report, so it was nice seeing you guys have a good night.
[20:38.370 --> 20:40.370]  Instead of, fuck it, I quit.
[20:40.370 --> 20:41.370]  Yeah, for sure.
[20:41.370 --> 20:42.370]  But it wouldn't have blown up.
[20:42.370 --> 20:44.370]  Yeah, it wouldn't have blown up.
[20:44.370 --> 20:52.370]  And if you had the opportunity to go on the news in front of camera, would you rather say, and tonight I respectfully resign, or would you rather be like, you suck, you suck, you suck, fuck it, I quit.
[20:54.370 --> 20:55.370]  Me?
[20:55.370 --> 20:56.370]  Yeah, for sure.
[20:56.370 --> 21:01.370]  But you, being my friend, would kind of stand back and say, yeah, don't be you.
[21:01.970 --> 21:02.970]  Yeah.
[21:02.970 --> 21:03.970]  Yeah.
[21:03.970 --> 21:12.970]  Alright, so the last line of the article says, Alaskans are set to vote on ballot measure two, which would legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use in November.
[21:12.970 --> 21:16.970]  Colorado and Washington have implemented similar legislation in the last year.
[21:16.970 --> 21:19.970]  What the fuck have they been doing up there?
[21:19.970 --> 21:22.970]  They made it against the law to drink in separate counties.
[21:22.970 --> 21:24.970]  That was ballot initiative one, I'm guessing.
[21:24.970 --> 21:27.970]  And ballot initiative two is to maybe legalize marijuana?
[21:28.570 --> 21:38.570]  Dude, did you hear the ratio a minute ago when it was like, every 30 seconds an American is arrested for pot and every 4.3 minutes in-
[21:38.570 --> 21:40.570]  4.3 hours in Alaska.
[21:40.570 --> 21:42.570]  Dude, what a big fucking ratio.
[21:42.570 --> 21:44.570]  What are they doing up there, arresting moose?
[21:44.570 --> 21:46.570]  Like, hey, get out.
[21:46.570 --> 21:48.570]  They're all after the moose knuckles.
[21:48.570 --> 21:50.570]  The moose knuckles.
[21:50.570 --> 21:57.570]  Well, hopefully they legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use in November.
[21:58.170 --> 22:00.170]  That would be freaking awesome.
[22:00.170 --> 22:03.170]  They would give us a lot less to watch on Alaskan State Troopers.
[22:03.170 --> 22:04.170]  Aww.
[22:04.170 --> 22:05.170]  Yeah.
[22:05.170 --> 22:06.170]  Alright.
[22:06.170 --> 22:08.170]  So, guys, tweet me what you think about this lady.
[22:08.170 --> 22:10.170]  You know what, I've seen so much about it.
[22:10.170 --> 22:12.170]  I know what you think about this lady.
[22:12.170 --> 22:14.170]  If you have more to contribute to our conversation, let me know.
[22:14.170 --> 22:15.170]  I'd be glad to hear it.
[22:15.170 --> 22:16.170]  Add to it.
[22:16.170 --> 22:17.170]  Add to the conversation.
[22:17.170 --> 22:18.170]  Keep the conversation going.
[22:18.170 --> 22:24.170]  Did she screw herself by using the language she did, or did she actually help herself out by using that language?
[22:24.170 --> 22:25.170]  That's what I want to know.
[22:25.770 --> 22:29.770]  I'm on the border of, I'm down with saying, fuck it, I quit.
[22:29.770 --> 22:38.770]  But then all my friends who have respectable businesses and respectable things would be like, no, you really should.
[22:38.770 --> 22:40.770]  And it's usually afterwards.
[22:40.770 --> 22:42.770]  It's usually at this point in time where we're talking now.
[22:42.770 --> 22:44.770]  So, yeah.
[22:44.770 --> 22:46.770]  Probably shouldn't have done that, bro.
[22:46.770 --> 22:48.770]  How many times have I said that to you?
[22:48.770 --> 22:51.770]  You preemptive strike a lot.
[22:51.770 --> 22:54.770]  A lot more than my parents did, I'll tell you that much.
[22:55.370 --> 22:57.370]  It took you a lot less time to figure it out.
[22:57.370 --> 22:59.370]  And I'm good after that, right?
[22:59.370 --> 23:05.370]  Yeah, once I say, bro, do you realize that you're just about to put nitro and glycerin in the same container and shake it up?
[23:05.370 --> 23:07.370]  Do you see that coming?
[23:07.370 --> 23:11.370]  Then you go, oh, yeah, I have nitro and glycerin in the same container.
[23:11.370 --> 23:13.370]  But once I've warned you, you're pretty on it.
[23:13.370 --> 23:15.370]  I have been guilty to fail.
[23:15.370 --> 23:17.370]  You know, you've got to fail to learn.
[23:17.370 --> 23:21.370]  How many, if you try stuff and you do it perfectly, you're like, I'm fucking good at that.
[23:21.370 --> 23:23.370]  I owe a dollar for that one.
[23:23.970 --> 23:25.970]  But if you do something and you fail, you're like, boy, I'm humbled.
[23:25.970 --> 23:27.970]  I really failed.
[23:27.970 --> 23:29.970]  I got to learn how to do this, right?
[23:29.970 --> 23:31.970]  You don't learn anything the first time you get stuff right.
[23:31.970 --> 23:33.970]  I agree.
[23:33.970 --> 23:35.970]  So, where'd that article go?
[23:35.970 --> 23:37.970]  Here it is.
[23:37.970 --> 23:39.970]  Adam actually brought this article to my attention.
[23:39.970 --> 23:41.970]  It's written by Jeremy P. Meyer.
[23:41.970 --> 23:43.970]  We found this on the DenverPost.com.
[23:43.970 --> 23:49.970]  It says, Colorado schools out millions due to marijuana excise tax loophole.
[23:50.570 --> 23:52.570]  Well, it's not, they're not out.
[23:52.570 --> 23:56.570]  This sounds like they had millions in their pockets and somebody reached in and took it out.
[23:56.570 --> 23:58.570]  That's not the way this went.
[23:58.570 --> 24:00.570]  That's the way I read it.
[24:00.570 --> 24:02.570]  Yeah, I read this article.
[24:02.570 --> 24:04.570]  It's a little misleading, but they have to do that with headlines to get you to read it.
[24:04.570 --> 24:06.570]  The schools did get kind of punked a little bit, but it wasn't a loophole.
[24:06.570 --> 24:08.570]  It was a business move and it wasn't aimed.
[24:08.570 --> 24:10.570]  Nobody was like, let's screw the schools.
[24:10.570 --> 24:12.570]  Nobody did that.
[24:12.570 --> 24:14.570]  It was just what business people were doing because it's how business was being done at the time.
[24:14.570 --> 24:16.570]  How the law was wrote.
[24:17.170 --> 24:19.170]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:19.170 --> 24:21.170]  So it says, a loophole built into Colorado's marijuana system has allowed thousands of pounds of pot to go untaxed
[24:21.170 --> 24:23.170]  and has cost the state millions of dollars that should have gone to school construction fund.
[24:23.170 --> 24:25.170]  In 2012, Colorado voters overwhelmingly approved Amendment 64,
[24:25.170 --> 24:27.170]  which among other things, promised that the first $40 million in excise tax revenue
[24:27.170 --> 24:29.170]  would be dedicated every year for the state's school construction fund.
[24:29.170 --> 24:31.170]  But this year, only about $10 million is expected to be allocated for the state's school construction fund.
[24:31.170 --> 24:33.170]  So, it's a little misleading.
[24:33.170 --> 24:35.170]  It's not the way I read it.
[24:35.170 --> 24:37.170]  It's not the way I read it.
[24:37.170 --> 24:39.170]  It's not the way I read it.
[24:39.170 --> 24:41.170]  It's not the way I read it.
[24:41.170 --> 24:43.170]  It's not the way I read it.
[24:43.170 --> 24:45.170]  It's not the way I read it.
[24:45.770 --> 24:47.770]  So, in total, only about $2.10 million is expected to be raised
[24:47.770 --> 24:49.770]  thanks to a rule that allows marijuana retailers
[24:49.770 --> 24:51.770]  to avoid paying the tax and a one-time transfer of wholesale pot.
[24:55.270 --> 24:57.270]  Sorry I had to clear my face there.
[24:57.270 --> 24:59.270]  Surely, revenue will increase over time as the industry continues
[24:59.270 --> 25:01.270]  to mature and fewer license holders are able to use
[25:01.270 --> 25:03.270]  the one-time tax-free transfer.
[25:03.270 --> 25:05.270]  So, what they're able to do,
[25:05.270 --> 25:07.270]  I haven't read far enough into the article here,
[25:07.270 --> 25:09.270]  but what they are able to do,
[25:09.270 --> 25:11.270]  shops that have medical marijuana
[25:11.270 --> 25:13.270]  are able to move it from their medical marijuana side
[25:13.270 --> 25:17.910]  their medical marijuana side to the recreational marijuana side to make it available for everybody
[25:17.910 --> 25:23.730]  instead of just medical patients. But there must be a tax paid when that happens because
[25:23.730 --> 25:30.310]  the taxes are different on the medical side and the rec side. And Colorado tried to protect
[25:30.310 --> 25:36.030]  the medical side a little bit by doing this, but in my opinion, it has failed. So I'll
[25:36.030 --> 25:40.470]  continue into the article. Whether the excise tax revenue will ever reach 40 million is
[25:40.470 --> 25:46.110]  anyone's guess. My suspicion is the amount will never be attained as and was a pie in
[25:46.110 --> 25:51.210]  the sky figure meant to attract voters. If that sounds familiar, you may be remembering
[25:51.210 --> 25:58.070]  the 2008 campaign for Amendment 50 that promised 182 million over five years to community colleges
[25:58.070 --> 26:02.750]  from the expansion of gaming. However, only 25.3 million has been generated through the
[26:02.750 --> 26:10.430]  fiscal year 2012 to 2013. After people are spending their money on pot, marijuana, excise
[26:10.430 --> 26:15.510]  tax revenues would certainly grow if the loophole that was created by regulators to
[26:15.510 --> 26:20.430]  launch the industry was closed. There are still 275 license holders who could take advantage
[26:20.430 --> 26:26.910]  of it according to one source. The loophole was created to make sure enough pot would
[26:26.910 --> 26:33.470]  be in the retail marketplace when doors opened on January 1st, 2014. Regulators allowed medical
[26:33.470 --> 26:40.390]  marijuana licensees converting to retail a one-time tax-free transfer. That transfer
[26:40.390 --> 26:44.550]  was a big difference between Colorado and Washington, the other state that legalized
[26:44.550 --> 26:50.550]  retail marijuana. And why the... Sorry, I had to reread that sentence because it looked
[26:50.550 --> 26:54.470]  weird to me. Something didn't sound right. But okay. That transfer was a big difference
[26:54.470 --> 26:58.750]  between Colorado, was the big difference is what it should say, between Colorado and Washington,
[26:58.750 --> 27:03.110]  the other state that legalized retail marijuana. And why the centennial state was out the door
[27:03.110 --> 27:10.550]  first. Washington had to grow its retail crop from seed. Colorado officials say 9,711
[27:10.550 --> 27:19.310]  pounds of medical pot was transferred tax-free to retail stores. 4,724 pounds of medical
[27:19.310 --> 27:26.870]  marijuana was moved to retail marijuana products and manufacturers, and 8,576 pounds of medical
[27:26.870 --> 27:33.590]  pot was transferred to retail marijuana cultivation facilities. That last trench will be subject
[27:33.590 --> 27:39.990]  to the tax once it is transferred or sold to another marijuana establishment. Yeah,
[27:39.990 --> 27:44.830]  there will be taxes made on this, just not that original transfer tax. So it says, it
[27:44.830 --> 27:49.390]  is estimated the untaxed pot would have provided $3 million for the state school construction
[27:49.390 --> 27:53.950]  fund or twice what the fund received in the fiscal year. Kathy Gerpart, a member of the
[27:53.950 --> 27:58.550]  public school capital construction assistance board. That's a lot of words for a board.
[27:58.550 --> 28:03.590]  That's a big title. Yeah. Provide the board that provides grants for schools, construction
[28:03.590 --> 28:08.690]  and renovation, knew the numbers were going to be low after seeing February's receipts.
[28:08.690 --> 28:12.150]  The first month we were thinking we were going to be rolling in cash, she said. Then the
[28:12.150 --> 28:15.830]  second month it was, wait a minute, we're only getting fractions of what we thought
[28:15.830 --> 28:21.930]  we were going to get in. This was not the voter intent, she said. I don't think anyone
[28:21.930 --> 28:27.770]  who voted for amendment 64 thought this would happen, she said. They thought the money would
[28:27.770 --> 28:34.170]  go to school kids. This is coming at the expensive kids in really needy school districts. Sorry,
[28:34.170 --> 28:39.410]  there's the text is broken up oddly with ads here. Sorry. The building excellent schools
[28:39.410 --> 28:43.810]  today or best fund is a competitive grant program that helps districts with capital
[28:43.810 --> 28:47.810]  construction. It is able to support projects in rural school districts that don't have
[28:47.810 --> 28:52.730]  large property basis necessary for bond projects. The best fund over the years has received
[28:52.730 --> 29:00.250]  more than $385 million in revenue, 90% from the state land trust. This year, the best
[29:00.250 --> 29:05.110]  fund is helping construction buildings and the Edson 54 JT school district and supporting
[29:05.110 --> 29:08.890]  projects and dozens of school districts around the state for things like roof replacements
[29:08.890 --> 29:15.570]  and boilers. Marijuana taxes are providing less than 1% of the program's funds or $3.1
[29:15.570 --> 29:20.370]  million. It would have made a big difference, she said. Whether there is a tax credit on
[29:20.370 --> 29:26.490]  the other side, there is somebody to whom the tax credit should have gone. Okay, proposition
[29:26.490 --> 29:32.850]  double A, which was approved by voters in 2013 mandates a 15% excise tax on imposed
[29:32.850 --> 29:39.210]  imposed on unprocessed retail marijuana. But amendment 64 says no excise taxes can be charged
[29:39.210 --> 29:44.210]  on pot cultivated as medical marijuana. A transfer logically of medically grown pot
[29:44.210 --> 29:48.730]  couldn't be taxed, which is the basis for the loophole. The simple solution then is
[29:48.730 --> 29:53.290]  to discontinue transfers. The state doesn't need them anyway. The retail pot industry
[29:53.290 --> 29:58.290]  is up and running now and doesn't need the influx of medical pot to prop up retail stores.
[29:58.290 --> 30:03.490]  Plus transfers disadvantage retail growers who have to pay the tax when medical growers
[30:03.490 --> 30:09.130]  don't for that one time swap. It was never our intent to manipulate the market said Rep.
[30:09.130 --> 30:15.050]  Dan Pabon. It's correct. It's a correction that needs to be made. He said also a draft
[30:15.050 --> 30:21.210]  bill already had been written that would stop the transfer after January 1 2016. But the
[30:21.210 --> 30:25.730]  loophole should be closed sooner to match the voters intent and make good on a promise
[30:25.730 --> 30:32.690]  that the revenue should be going to schools. I agree. The revenue should go to the schools
[30:32.690 --> 30:42.530]  but where's the other money going? Like if why did it get exempt from the schools? If
[30:42.530 --> 30:49.370]  I understand 40 million 40 million sounds a lot just that money they said when we make
[30:49.370 --> 30:58.650]  40 million in like the first 48 hours maybe in total sales maybe but then what they're
[30:58.650 --> 31:04.130]  saying is this tax that they had this tax set up this tax was supposed to go here and
[31:04.130 --> 31:08.690]  the money didn't happen because these guys found a way to not make the money. We had
[31:08.690 --> 31:14.050]  that you read that article not that long ago where it was 1.9 tax 1.9 million dollars of
[31:14.050 --> 31:18.610]  taxable money from this county alone right? All that was that's set up to go to different
[31:18.610 --> 31:22.430]  places that this fund this one is the one that didn't happen because they said this
[31:22.430 --> 31:26.890]  money right here specifically. That's just bullshit. Why they who who was the one was
[31:26.890 --> 31:31.450]  like yeah cut the kids out you know like in the council was like I got a good idea.
[31:31.450 --> 31:34.050]  That's what I'm saying they didn't that's it wasn't even aimed to do that it's just
[31:34.050 --> 31:38.930]  kind of this rule was set up to help them have enough herb for when the shops opened
[31:38.930 --> 31:42.890]  but that was also they said when this money's made it's going to the schools but then it
[31:42.890 --> 31:47.090]  just didn't get made. Nobody was really like fuck that fund fuck those kids that's two
[31:47.090 --> 31:51.930]  dollars nobody was really like that it's just that's just how it worked out that they found
[31:51.930 --> 31:56.850]  a way around that like if I told you it would be nice if they were like all right this is
[31:56.850 --> 32:04.530]  we we cut we were expecting you know maybe a hundred million dollars for the first year
[32:04.530 --> 32:09.130]  and they just said you know what we'll have the best schools anywhere you know here just
[32:09.130 --> 32:17.290]  take this next year's us you know we'll divvy it up but there's why not you know drop that
[32:17.290 --> 32:24.410]  common core shit and get on with your fucking lives tell the rest of the country that you
[32:24.410 --> 32:33.290]  were the high ones yeah yeah we're not gonna do that I kind of agree that they should change
[32:33.290 --> 32:37.890]  the rule by 2016 they're right if the shops are doing it right they don't need to move
[32:37.890 --> 32:43.530]  herb around and if you're growing medical herb it needs to be there for the patients
[32:43.530 --> 32:48.970]  yeah so they didn't really purposely screw the kids out that's just how like if I told
[32:48.970 --> 32:52.450]  you if you drive around the block every day on your work you don't have to pay the three
[32:52.450 --> 32:56.530]  dollar toll fee but that three dollar toll toll fee goes to the skit to the school kids
[32:56.530 --> 32:59.850]  you'd still drive around the block you wouldn't give a shit about that three dollars and that's
[32:59.850 --> 33:02.650]  kind of what they did they just drove around the block they didn't really they didn't go
[33:02.650 --> 33:06.330]  take the three bucks and stab somebody for it and they just skip paying it they figured
[33:06.330 --> 33:13.770]  out how of this whole taking medical and taking it recreational I went out to the shop the
[33:13.770 --> 33:20.210]  other day I won't say which one but it was for their special there was nothing on the
[33:20.210 --> 33:26.250]  medical side zero and they're like well you can choose from the recreational there was
[33:26.250 --> 33:33.850]  literally four kinds and it was all sativa heavy 70% you know who knows what they're
[33:33.850 --> 33:37.450]  talking pretty sure I know what shop you went to and they've recently opened up another
[33:37.450 --> 33:42.370]  location north of here and I have a friend who stopped there just the other day and they
[33:42.370 --> 33:46.450]  were hopping and the place was full and had all kinds of great shit so what they've done
[33:46.450 --> 33:51.490]  is they've taken all their products in their Pueblo West location no it's full like oh
[33:51.490 --> 33:58.090]  oh maybe they're there they're marijuana yes but they did a whole shelf of shatter a whole
[33:58.090 --> 34:03.610]  bunch of new extracts and things like that and all kinds of other stuff except for bud
[34:03.610 --> 34:10.210]  and it was their special day I was in there like 11 o'clock you know it's yeah the shops
[34:10.210 --> 34:15.250]  need to get it together in my opinion for sure I'm just saying that affected us you
[34:15.250 --> 34:21.010]  know that affected us here locally that affected me local patients yeah that's so why that really
[34:21.010 --> 34:27.170]  sucks is because as a medical on the medical side the herb is cheaper to just to start
[34:27.170 --> 34:35.890]  it's considered medicine it's it's not even you know I I'm not gonna lie about it I have
[34:35.890 --> 34:42.730]  it for not strangling my wife and children for stress relief but so on the medical side it's a
[34:42.730 --> 34:47.770]  little bit cheaper to start with on the recreational side they charge you more then on the recreational
[34:47.770 --> 34:53.850]  side they add a tax to it so let's just move the same product from the recreational star from the
[34:53.850 --> 34:58.530]  medical side right over to the recreational side mark it up ten bucks an eighth more screw the
[34:58.530 --> 35:03.970]  medical patients out more than that 15 bucks an eighth more half it's half the price more it's so
[35:03.970 --> 35:08.730]  so yeah just mark it up way high charge an extra tax for it and then don't even care about the
[35:08.730 --> 35:12.890]  medical patients anymore how can a shop do that how can a business owner do that and look his
[35:12.890 --> 35:19.650]  patients his customers whoa they give you priority over the rec patients that means the rec patients
[35:19.650 --> 35:24.970]  is gonna just sit out there and have red card patients come in come in come in and they do and
[35:24.970 --> 35:30.370]  they just sit there so if you got that's the only thing you get though right is that red card
[35:30.370 --> 35:34.450]  priority then they should take you into the red card side and take care of you properly Pablo
[35:34.450 --> 35:39.410]  they won't let him open up the they already bought this the location next to him had it all
[35:39.410 --> 35:47.810]  worked out with the owner and the city came in and says hold on no no no no no no no no and
[35:47.810 --> 35:51.530]  they're like what do you mean no we're doing banging business and that's right there you know
[35:51.530 --> 35:56.290]  perfect location and they're like yeah but you're not spreading and more of that we got enough

[38:06.010 --> 38:11.650]  I don't do it I don't care that much all right so prosecutors object to war on weed is the title of
[38:11.650 --> 38:16.410]  this article I'm looking for someone who wrote it where's the author what's that mine or yours
[38:16.410 --> 38:20.530]  Chris Wiggins I was for Mike this is one of the Mike's into I'm sorry that's cool you're bummed
[38:20.530 --> 38:29.050]  out to show on the road keeping the show on the road all right prosecutors object to war on weed
[38:29.050 --> 38:34.930]  by Chris Wiggins I probably said that wrong but you know that's how I do stuff whoa technical
[38:34.930 --> 38:39.850]  glitch there sound like I cut out for a second anyway where was I Chris we get all right the
[38:39.850 --> 38:44.450]  prosecution objects that's one way to put it at any rate two news stories from the Pacific
[38:44.450 --> 38:48.890]  Northwest today pose an interesting question our prosecutors beginning to get fed up with the war
[38:48.890 --> 38:54.210]  on weed the two stories are completely unrelated I should mention one is about a current prosecutor
[38:54.210 --> 38:59.130]  at the local level and one is about a formal former federal prosecutor making a noteworthy
[38:59.130 --> 39:04.170]  endorsement neither has anything to do with the other but both show some common sense being
[39:04.410 --> 39:10.850]  in a refreshing ways it's too early to call it a trend even a regional regional one but it
[39:10.850 --> 39:16.490]  certainly is a step in the right direction at the very least so first the local story
[39:16.490 --> 39:24.730]  Seattle's electric geez Seattle's elected prosecutor said Monday he's dropping all
[39:24.730 --> 39:29.250]  tickets issued for the public use of marijuana through the first seven months of this year
[39:29.250 --> 39:34.450]  because most of them were issued by a single officer who disagrees with the legal potlaw in
[39:34.450 --> 39:40.130]  a briefing to City Council on Monday City Attorney Pete Holmes says he is moving to dismiss
[39:40.130 --> 39:46.210]  approximately 100 tickets issued by the Seattle Police Department between January 1st and July
[39:46.210 --> 39:53.010]  31st his office also said it would be seeking a refund for 22 people who have already paid
[39:53.130 --> 40:00.330]  their $27 ticket so one state to the south a former federal prosecutor for Oregon has thrown
[40:00.330 --> 40:05.330]  her support behind a ballot initiative to legalize recreational marijuana for adults in the state
[40:05.330 --> 40:12.210]  Chris Olson who served as Oregon's chief federal prosecutor during the Clinton administration made
[40:12.210 --> 40:18.250]  the news by joining House Member Earl Blumenhauer and a former Oregon Supreme Court justice by
[40:18.770 --> 40:24.050]  publicly supporting the ballot measure and here's the story I enforce our marijuana laws but they
[40:24.050 --> 40:28.810]  don't work Olson said in a statement announcing her endorsement filling our courts and jails has
[40:28.810 --> 40:34.690]  failed to reduce marijuana use and drug cartels are pocketing all the profits she said citing
[40:34.690 --> 40:41.130]  federal statistics that show about 1 in 14 Oregon arrests is for marijuana possession
[40:41.130 --> 40:49.130]  real quick here you know we're not the government here in Colorado is not bitching about the cartel
[40:49.130 --> 40:55.410]  really any much anymore running pot now they're starting to look at like you guys you know I'm
[40:55.410 --> 41:02.730]  saying like the the guys who take care of patients they're like hold on they're not just we don't
[41:02.730 --> 41:08.770]  have control over everything so we need that and that's what it's become it's not even a crime
[41:08.770 --> 41:14.370]  anymore so now they're starting to turn into well we're making tons of money but how can we get just
[41:14.370 --> 41:19.650]  a little more each year a little more each year there's no worry of cartels anymore the old guys
[41:19.650 --> 41:25.250]  around here a lot of the old-timers don't like to pay kind bud prices you know I mean you can get if
[41:25.250 --> 41:31.450]  you know the right people you can get an eighth of dank weed around here for 25 bucks back in the
[41:31.450 --> 41:38.490]  day those guys used to buy that Mexican brick weed for $25 a half ounce and they love it they only
[41:38.570 --> 41:42.690]  smoke a bowl a day two bowls a day so some kind bud would just kill him you know two hits and they
[41:42.690 --> 41:48.130]  just be retarded but lately those guys are calling up like the guys I used to talk to years ago they're
[41:48.130 --> 41:53.130]  like hey man and can you get any decent weed because they can't find any of their old swag
[41:53.130 --> 41:58.450]  connects anymore all that shit is gone that cartel Mexican import weed is disappearing so it's not
[41:58.450 --> 42:04.610]  around I'll come up with that high CBD so we got a first story here and this is my interjection here
[42:04.610 --> 42:09.130]  I'm not into the article right now the first story here is about a prosecutor saying that he's gonna
[42:09.130 --> 42:14.450]  drop tickets written by a cop because that cops a dick and did this out of his own you reported on
[42:14.450 --> 42:19.770]  this yeah earlier up so yeah fuck that cop yeah I'll take a dollar for that one yeah and then we
[42:19.770 --> 42:27.530]  have another person saying the laws don't work and they state that they actually the drug cartels are
[42:27.530 --> 42:32.490]  profiting so it looks like some people are starting to understand some people are starting to see the
[42:32.490 --> 42:37.450]  light these are positive reasons why we want to legalize cannabis so I'll get back into the
[42:37.450 --> 42:44.090]  article in the first instance this was nothing short of a prosecutor using it using his prosecutorial
[42:44.090 --> 42:49.570]  discretion to avoid wasting a lot of time in the courts and more importantly to rain and rain in
[42:49.570 --> 42:54.250]  one police officer who was obviously on a vendetta against the voters for passing a law he did not
[42:54.250 --> 43:01.170]  personally approve of one single police officer was responsible for eight out of all ten tickets
[43:01.170 --> 43:05.570]  issued in the Seattle for public in Seattle for public consumption of marijuana during the first
[43:05.570 --> 43:11.610]  half of this year the other 20% were written by the entire rest of the police force to put this
[43:11.610 --> 43:17.650]  in another way this officer wrote one ticket he considered this officer on one ticket wrote he
[43:17.650 --> 43:23.210]  considered the new legalization law silly while the other off while the officer has been reassigned
[43:23.210 --> 43:29.130]  new duties after this came to light there are a lot of folks with cases still in the legal system
[43:29.130 --> 43:34.410]  as a result of his actions what a dick of a cop cops don't realize what they're doing to you when
[43:34.410 --> 43:38.130]  they screw you up for having some a little bit of weed or whatever you're doing they don't and some
[43:38.130 --> 43:42.410]  of them do and they love it that shit sucks come on guys if you're a cop some cops are listening to
[43:42.410 --> 43:47.330]  the podcast I know you are I know you're a law enforcement officer we want to educate you about
[43:47.330 --> 43:54.850]  how not dangerous cannabis is it's something that ask us yeah I mean especially if it's here just
[43:55.850 --> 43:59.850]  listen to the show guys learn I'd inform yourself listen to me I'm a smart dude I'm an educated dude
[43:59.850 --> 44:03.730]  I'm reading news I'm trying to educate people I'm trying to keep people safe we're not bad people
[44:03.730 --> 44:09.050]  did you not just hear stoners with words right there with yeah that was a that was impressive
[44:09.050 --> 44:14.370]  smokes pot not a bad person right yeah in Washington State of course recreational marijuana
[44:14.370 --> 44:18.610]  use is legal the voters approve the change in state law and the prosecutors actions quite
[44:18.610 --> 44:22.610]  obviously reflect the people the will of the people but it didn't have to happen this way
[44:22.730 --> 44:27.650]  prosecutors in general are pretty much tough on crime types of people and if this particular
[44:27.650 --> 44:31.770]  prosecutor has agreed with the cops way of thinking then all these cases would have
[44:31.770 --> 44:38.050]  continued to clog the legal system all the way to the bitter end all $27 of it this prosecutor
[44:38.050 --> 44:42.530]  however objected to that scenario and applied some common sense he's even going the extra mile
[44:42.530 --> 44:47.450]  and trying to refund fines already paid that is truly commendable that is a truly commendable
[44:47.450 --> 44:53.290]  action once again reflecting the will of the voters in legal reality the second news item
[44:53.290 --> 44:57.970]  doesn't seem to deal with actual legal cases it comes from a prosecutor who no longer works for
[44:57.970 --> 45:03.930]  the for the federal Department of Justice still this is a stunning development federal prosecutors
[45:03.930 --> 45:08.530]  after all are not bound by any state law and therefore it can apply federal law whether
[45:08.530 --> 45:13.850]  marijuana is still the most illegal of all drugs aware marijuana is still the most legal of all
[45:14.010 --> 45:19.610]  illegal of all drugs without even having to weigh in on state politics believe it or not there are
[45:19.610 --> 45:24.330]  some extremely zealous federal prosecutors all up and down the west coast who are fighting tooth
[45:24.330 --> 45:30.450]  and nail against any state legalization efforts in unprecedented and creative ways so hearing even a
[45:30.450 --> 45:36.170]  former prosecutor bluntly refute the entire purpose of the federal war on weed is a welcome
[45:36.170 --> 45:41.570]  development indeed the language she used is a pretty strong condemnation of federal laws she
[45:41.570 --> 45:46.650]  upheld while in office I enforced our marijuana laws and they don't work prosecutors are practical
[45:46.650 --> 45:51.330]  people who deal with the real end aftermath of arresting marijuana users so the argument used
[45:51.330 --> 45:57.810]  is not a more is not a moral one locking up marijuana users is wrong or one of racial equality
[45:57.810 --> 46:02.290]  black and brown people are treated differently by the court system or even a political one the
[46:02.290 --> 46:07.010]  public's mood has shifted instead it's a view from the front lines of the drug war which relies on
[46:07.010 --> 46:11.690]  personal experience in applying federal laws and the relative effectiveness of carrying out this
[46:11.690 --> 46:18.890]  job I enforced our marijuana laws and they don't work so this person instead of just playing by
[46:18.890 --> 46:24.250]  the book basically saying had weed go to jail had weed go to jail had a lot of weed go to prison
[46:24.250 --> 46:28.410]  they're actually looking at what they're doing to people like I was saying they're saying you
[46:28.410 --> 46:33.130]  had some weed you're a human let's quit smoking weed here's a fine get your shit together don't
[46:33.130 --> 46:37.370]  go to prison forever don't go get butt-raped turn it they're taking some compassion into this
[46:37.370 --> 46:43.730]  finally they're just starting to hear the other side of the story and that's all you nine times
[46:43.730 --> 46:48.810]  out of ten you got to do yeah you know when you're going to court and stand in front of the judge
[46:48.810 --> 46:54.610]  everybody just kind of pushes you behind your lawyer or public detent pretender you know sitting
[46:54.610 --> 46:59.730]  there and that's the they say you have your day but a lot of times they just ask you if you
[46:59.730 --> 47:06.130]  understand and it's a yes or no question is all you really get so it's good they're finally
[47:06.130 --> 47:11.610]  starting to be like what did you have you know yeah so all right so of all the pro legalization
[47:11.610 --> 47:16.690]  arguments this could perhaps be the strongest one the laws don't work they don't have the intended
[47:16.690 --> 47:21.650]  effect the feds have been fighting the war on weed for almost a century now with precious little to
[47:21.650 --> 47:29.330]  show for it yeah definitely and in fact they have severe unintended consequences drug cartel drug
[47:29.450 --> 47:35.250]  cartels are pocketing all of the profits therefore mindlessly continuing on the same course is
[47:35.250 --> 47:40.250]  nothing short of madness I think that's what they call insanity Chris Olson is not the first law
[47:40.250 --> 47:44.650]  enforcement officer to have this revelation and begin publicly trying to change the situation
[47:44.650 --> 47:49.930]  an entire organization already exists law enforcement against prohibition or leap for
[47:49.930 --> 47:54.730]  members of the law enforcement community past and present to advocate the marijuana legal reform
[47:54.890 --> 48:00.770]  many members are former cops who have firsthand who saw firsthand how pointless the entire war
[48:00.770 --> 48:06.050]  on weed truly was throughout their careers now free to the prospect of ending their career over
[48:06.050 --> 48:10.850]  a public statement many are speaking out on the subject their message is a simple one prohibition
[48:10.850 --> 48:18.170]  didn't work and prohibition of marijuana isn't working either Chris Olson is to be commended
[48:18.170 --> 48:23.290]  for raising her own prosecute prosecutorial objection and for knowing her public support
[48:23.290 --> 48:27.730]  behind a ballot measure in the state where she used to uphold the law the personal connection to
[48:27.730 --> 48:32.890]  the state ballot measure might convince a few voters even though even tough on crime types
[48:32.890 --> 48:40.370]  that sorry let me move this page it's all scrolling on its own there we go where were we all the rest
[48:40.370 --> 48:44.370]  of the arguments aside the law needs changing because it doesn't work it does nothing short
[48:44.370 --> 48:48.650]  of waste time for the entire judicial system for something which shouldn't even be illegal in the
[48:48.650 --> 48:54.370]  first place the Oregon ballot measure race may be close the year Washington and Colorado legalized
[48:54.370 --> 48:59.370]  recreational marijuana Oregon had a similar but badly written initiative on its ballot it failed
[48:59.370 --> 49:04.650]  this time around the effort is a lot more serious but reliable polling on the subject is notoriously
[49:04.650 --> 49:10.610]  hard to do so the vote might be very close in November guys if you're in Oregon when this
[49:10.610 --> 49:17.690]  comes up go vote to legalize cannabis so pro legalization groups will be very closely watching
[49:17.690 --> 49:24.170]  the vote this year in Oregon and in Alaska and Washington DC so assumably assumably sorry my
[49:24.170 --> 49:29.730]  throat's burning out I'm trying to go fast assumably they'll also be closely watching
[49:29.730 --> 49:34.810]  the impact of Olson simple the laws don't work message Olson's message is a powerful one because
[49:34.810 --> 49:40.130]  it could reach voters not generally open to other pro legalization arguments if you're a law and
[49:40.130 --> 49:44.650]  order type of voter a formal former federal prosecutors opinion should carry some weight
[49:44.650 --> 49:49.810]  in other words perhaps more prosecutors both state and federal both current and former can
[49:49.810 --> 49:55.170]  be enlisted in this movement as I said it is far too early to call this any sort of trend but it
[49:55.170 --> 50:00.450]  certainly is a development worth taking note of Dan on the legal theme we began on perhaps the
[50:00.450 --> 50:08.490]  voters will sustain these prosecutors objections and you can follow Chris on Twitter this was
[50:08.490 --> 50:16.290]  written by Chris Chris Wiggins at Chris we get we ig and he very well written article make sure
[50:16.290 --> 50:23.410]  you follow him on Twitter thanks for letting me read your stuff man people are catching on it
[50:23.410 --> 50:32.170]  looks like it for sure it's glad to see the people are just open for debate at least yeah
[50:32.330 --> 50:40.450]  and maybe like they said maybe now that the state has melted the older people don't want to hear
[50:40.450 --> 50:45.450]  from you and me then weed is harmless that cannabis is helpful that medical marijuana
[50:45.450 --> 50:49.890]  will help you people don't want to hear that but if you're a former if you're a former from the
[50:49.890 --> 50:56.650]  Fed then they have to listen to you because you're obviously not foolish it huh well at least they
[50:56.650 --> 50:59.970]  should trust you because you're the one been feeding them the shit for the past you know
[50:59.970 --> 51:06.170]  however many years so well now what do we believe him do we believe all the bullshit that you told
[51:06.170 --> 51:11.330]  us for many many years or do we believe your new bullshit soon as we start believing the new
[51:11.330 --> 51:16.330]  bullshit from the person that used to be like ex-military then we're crazy right along with
[51:16.330 --> 51:20.690]  him you know I'm saying they just label us as that they do you know yeah I don't know if you
[51:20.690 --> 51:29.770]  guys heard the air quotations but they were there so whatever man that's just crazy I hope Oregon
[51:29.770 --> 51:37.770]  gets it going because they you guys got so much talent I mean I've only seen from social media and
[51:37.770 --> 51:43.490]  stuff like that but I've seen people up that way just you're right between two meccas you know
[51:43.490 --> 51:51.570]  like there's you can't go wrong you'll be the perfect blend and I you got many respectable
[51:51.570 --> 52:00.890]  people up there already under medical coma think coma may have moved well but yeah it this is for
[52:00.890 --> 52:06.890]  rec weed also so let's get the rec weed going on it doesn't always have to be medical all right
[52:06.890 --> 52:10.610]  let's wrap up this show bro we've been going for a long time it sounds like we're gonna go get some

[58:27.510 --> 58:31.310]  you doing today buddy good brother how are you I'm doing good bro I was just told that there's a
[58:31.310 --> 58:35.710]  Garden of Weeden song written by our boy sloppy and it is freaking sweet yeah it's pretty tight
[58:35.710 --> 58:39.510]  shout out to sloppy thank you big shout out to our boy sloppy what's up brother thanks for listening

[58:43.390 --> 58:50.150]  Spencer said I gave him permission and it says Garden of Weeden in it so it's all Spence so
[58:50.150 --> 58:54.150]  thanks for joining me on the show bro no doubt for sure always a pleasure to be here oh man it's
[58:54.150 --> 59:00.110]  always fun taking dabs with you we hang out a lot and I like it so Spence is the winner of the
[59:00.110 --> 59:05.590]  Mountain Region secret cup some people might not be familiar with the secret cup so let's take a
[59:05.590 --> 59:13.590]  little bit to tell them what that is the secret cup is a what's actually a tour which they go to
[59:13.590 --> 59:19.750]  different places they go to two places in Cali if I'm correct I don't know if it's ever been put
[59:19.750 --> 59:24.910]  that way as a tour because that would be a hell of a marketing way to put some shirts out yeah I
[59:24.910 --> 59:29.150]  mean that's how I think of it and there's a championship in the middle into the tour that's
[59:29.150 --> 59:33.310]  a good way to put it I hope they're listening and they get a marketing idea from that um oh yeah
[59:33.310 --> 59:41.070]  California Seattle here maybe Michigan I'm not sure Arizona Rhode Island and then all the it's
[59:41.070 --> 59:49.310]  basically a competition of anywhere from 30 to 40 hash makers all inner a certain amount of product
[59:49.310 --> 59:55.150]  and then each one of the people that enter are considered judges because we all receive a judge
[59:55.150 --> 01:00:01.990]  pack go through them and kind of give everything a score from smell you know strength smoothness
[01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:11.310]  harshness color flavor you know down the line so each contestant actually gets 0.3 of every sample
[01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:16.710]  right yeah so you get to taste what everybody else is down everybody else entered you're the judge
[01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:20.830]  right and we're the judges so that's kind of a good thing about it is you know it's not being
[01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:28.110]  judged by just you know random people or like you know just it's not a most technically is a blind
[01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:33.750]  judge because nobody gets to see what you know yeah what entries are so it's all just numbered in
[01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:38.750]  whatever numbers or what you vote for so when you got your judges kit how long did it take you to
[01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:44.670]  find yours your entry like two minutes two minutes yeah yours you just had a lot of taste yeah yeah
[01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:51.190]  no I just you could go through the entries and kind of just smell and I make the hash so you kind
[01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:56.350]  of get attached I guess you could say to like yeah you know which is yours and what what is not I had
[01:00:56.350 --> 01:01:00.470]  there's a couple that I was like yeah maybe and then as soon as you find it it's perfect you're
[01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:05.230]  sick yeah that's it I could tell my flowers sorry guys I'm all choked up actually I went to the
[01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:09.230]  secret cup for two days and took an amazing amount of dabs and then today I went hang out with some
[01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:13.790]  friends in Denver and my lungs and throat are burnt out from dabbing you guys got a hydrate if you're
[01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:17.630]  dabbing that's something that I'm learning more hydration Spence reaches through the water as I
[01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:25.030]  say that we're all red-eyed and throat dried so yeah everybody got to I had the honor of tasting
[01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:28.870]  a couple of my friends were judges and entrance contenders I don't know what the hell they were
[01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:33.310]  called they were judges and they entered and I got to taste parts of their sample packs some
[01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:39.390]  were amazing some I don't think I would take a second dab of a lot of those yeah I mean there's
[01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:49.910]  definitely there's was 38 competitors in this one so 38.3 is you got to go through and you know it's
[01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:55.630]  kind of tough depending on what kind of what kind of like I'm a weed snob so I'm definitely gonna
[01:01:55.630 --> 01:02:00.350]  be an oil snob you know I'm saying so it's just a lot of its personal preference whether or not
[01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:05.510]  you like it this way or you like it that way so it's kind of that's why it's good that we're the
[01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:10.150]  judges because it's at least honest opinions I wanted to wait a little bit to get into live
[01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:15.070]  resin but I was worried with you entering live resin people were gonna say it's not stable because
[01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:21.270]  the popular shit the rage is shattered and the live resin is not shattery at all it's kind of it
[01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:27.670]  looks like it's like oil yeah it's like oil and then depending where it's at you know it's I think
[01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:34.630]  somebody said 66 degrees is when it actually gets it'll shatter if you're if your house is 66 degrees
[01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:39.710]  you like your house cold you'll have shattery live resin but it's almost that in here tonight
[01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:43.830]  it's getting nice and cool Colorado temperatures are changing like this oil is cool right now it's
[01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:49.430]  chilling um hey thanks dude the other day you gave me a little sample of Earl and I didn't even
[01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:54.030]  realize that I've been dabbing off of the entry I've been dabbing the winner here for several days
[01:02:54.030 --> 01:03:01.270]  thank you that's just tasty thank you so in a second we'll talk about what's in that the event
[01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:06.230]  we kind of talked about what it is the people that enter are the judges we all everybody gets to taste
[01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:13.430]  the entries so that's what it's all about and Spence was actually chosen as the overall champion
[01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:17.510]  there's a couple of the things I want to talk about there was two location changes
[01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:23.670]  I was yeah if not if you could probably count three yeah because the venues in Denver got

[01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:43.830]  shout out to the places and people that made that happen let's talk about your entry now
[01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:49.190]  um your entry was live resin do you want to tell the people what strain it was or are you kind of
[01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:58.470]  oh it's already out it's um it was senso g from uh sin city seeds um and it was mixed with scotts
[01:05:58.470 --> 01:06:07.510]  og from rare dankness um classy mix yeah yeah the senso g was a kosher kush dominant um
[01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:15.030]  fino I guess you'd call it um so you guys need to know about phenotypes
[01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:19.350]  go back a few episodes yeah for sure we talked about that yeah but um it was a real
[01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:28.630]  the uh scotts og was just an awesome og nice it was definitely lanky a very very
[01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:32.950]  not super tall but it was you know taller than I would usually like plants to be
[01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:41.830]  but um super fuely and heavy indica just you know awesome resin production um
[01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:46.790]  and a pretty decent yielder too um that was the one I mixed with the sins which
[01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:54.790]  is a kosher dominant which the sins og is blue power and kosher kush so it was a kosher
[01:06:54.790 --> 01:07:00.150]  kosher kush dominant um pheno and it just had a way better kosher like burnt rubber
[01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:08.950]  ishy smell which comes out and hashes an og smell it's got a fuely funk this hash definitely has a
[01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:14.310]  fuely funk to it it's delicious um I smoke a lot of sativas because like you said I'm a sativa
[01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:19.350]  breeder I smoke a lot of the sativa or a lot of sativa in this indica kind of dominance in here
[01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:23.430]  it really sits me down it makes my eyes droopy I really appreciate it it's really not a really
[01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:29.030]  nice cross what's got the citrus citrusy spice to it what's adding that there's like sort of a
[01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:35.590]  a spice to the end it's almost got a lemony citrus um that comes from the scotts okay um you get a
[01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:41.270]  little bit of lemon um og like that og pine this and sometimes the pine can transfer over to like a
[01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:49.350]  citrus a lemon um so it's a very it was a good strain you know it's a pheno hunt out of you know
[01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:53.910]  I ran a pack and I kept you know three or four of them and you know there's three or four of them in
[01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:59.110]  in the room and I got to pick which ones I wanted to make yeah the entry with so it was really it's
[01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:03.990]  really cool being able to actually go in and you know pick what flavors a lot of a lot of the people
[01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:10.390]  who won you know were like thanks to this person for letting me get the product you know and it was
[01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:15.350]  cool for us because I don't have to ask anybody for product it all comes from us all in-house is
[01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:19.030]  great too and it's good to know I've seen your guys's garden it's good to know that it's a clean
[01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:25.190]  safe garden where my medicine comes from I get a lot of my a lot of oils comes straight from you
[01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:29.430]  guys I'm kind of picky about where I'll get it yeah and you guys are the first people I go to
[01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:34.790]  when I need medicine how do you uh when you're looking in the room what makes you say
[01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:39.830]  that strain and that strain right there or that plant and that plant right there are going to
[01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:48.950]  make award-winning oil um honestly it's more of just you kind of literally go plant to plant and
[01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:55.670]  just you know you can't you can't do it in a day it kind of takes you know a week or two you know
[01:08:55.670 --> 01:09:00.390]  as they're finishing to be able to tell which flavors are going to come through um
[01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:07.030]  I was I don't even think I was going to do I made another batch the green ribbon batch
[01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:12.630]  um but the green ribbon just didn't carry it the same like when you feel some plants you know how
[01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:17.270]  they're like some plants are like super sticky where you touch them and then your fingers are
[01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:21.510]  stuck together and there's something you touch and you get like the stringiness yeah resin and
[01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:25.990]  then there's some you touch where it's like just wet where you don't even it's like slick uh-huh so
[01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:31.670]  you just kind of go and look for different you know okay for me it's a lot about flavors so I
[01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:35.830]  like to you know your hash is always flavorful I had a bunch of your shatter with me at the
[01:09:35.830 --> 01:09:40.550]  secret cup and everybody I would dab out would go oh that's tasty yeah and yeah it was a lot of
[01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:44.230]  golden goat that you made and some cookies that you made I've got some cookies you did a while
[01:09:44.230 --> 01:09:49.190]  back I've got it on secret stash secret stash hey shout out to vigor love shout out to vigor lover
[01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:56.150]  for the gift edit it right there he's a homie uh somehow he got to me some solventless hash that
[01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:59.190]  tastes pretty damn good right on bro good work I'm gonna have to edit some of that
[01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:04.230]  shit I don't know what I can leave in this looks mid so it's cool hashtag team mids
[01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:12.230]  poor guy cannot get away from that shit so uh we talk a lot about live resin on this show I am not
[01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:16.870]  a hash maker everybody tells me that I've always got great hash they compliment it I gotta say I
[01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:21.670]  don't make hash I know a lot about making hash because uh little kev bro is my buddy you're my
[01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:26.150]  buddy I know how to read uh the internet tells you all about making dabs if you want to know
[01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:31.510]  I like to be educated but I don't make hash I've been trying my best to describe live resin to
[01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:36.790]  people a lot of people have asked about it after you exhale that fucking monstrous dab I owe a
[01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:42.390]  dollar for that one I owe a dollar every time I say the f word on the show but after you yeah uh
[01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:47.590]  will you teach me and our listeners a little lesson about what live resin is and kind of how
[01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:55.910]  it's done um okay so everybody's heard of fresh frozen bubble hash so basically where you harvest
[01:10:55.910 --> 01:11:02.790]  your plant you essentially freeze it or flash freeze it um and then for ice hash you'd you
[01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:10.710]  know wash it in your bags or whatever so now instead of you know as far as opening blasting
[01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:16.870]  I know people who do it live resin but I think it's once the closed closed loop game came out
[01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:20.950]  and we figured out you could do that same process in a closed loop at a bigger scale
[01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:29.990]  it completely changes hash for the better in my opinion I think so um obviously yeah so basically
[01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:36.630]  it's fresh frozen closed loop bho um all right if done proper I'm gonna I'm gonna go a little
[01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:42.230]  slower on that one he's taking plants that are ready for harvest chop them down freeze them in
[01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:48.630]  the deep freeze and then put them in a closed loop butane extraction system which uh we'll talk more
[01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:53.190]  about that I think Kevin and I have talked about that but there's open blasting and closed loop
[01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:58.550]  Spence uses a closed loop method and blast the fresh frozen like that does it need to be vacuum
[01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:05.430]  purged after that um yeah well once it comes through your system you it's really you know
[01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:11.190]  oh it takes a lot of the butane out before you even get to touch the product using that
[01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:16.150]  closed loop using the closed loop so it pumps it out because it takes all the liquid back out
[01:12:16.150 --> 01:12:23.350]  ah you know so then you're left with just your product um as far as you know flavors I really
[01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:27.750]  think it keeps a better turf profile it honestly if you all right so this is gonna be kind of hard
[01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:33.430]  to understand but it tastes like it smells when it's growing if you can understand what you know
[01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:37.830]  when you touch a plant and you smell your fingers that crazy smell you get that it doesn't ever
[01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:45.190]  smell like that once it's dried and cured but once you when you're stripping or making hash
[01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:50.550]  from a fresh product you get that fresh flavor it's like if your bud was a fruit and you took
[01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:55.750]  a bite out of that fruit that's what this hash tastes like yeah and I love it it's got uh the
[01:12:55.750 --> 01:13:00.310]  terpenoid and that's yeah the turf profile in there and that's just everyone's new word now
[01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:04.630]  is turps turps turps so I just feel like an asshole every time I say turps but the turps in
[01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:10.230]  that is turpy slurpy it's just like a big it's like a bite of candy every time you hit a dab it's
[01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:15.350]  amazing it literally is like it could be dessert like one somebody needs to make some jelly bean
[01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:20.790]  live resin oh don't worry there's dude there's crazy like all right so blueberry sour diesel
[01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:27.590]  that sounds ridiculous doesn't it yeah it sounds delicious yeah uh yeah uh some tangy or some
[01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:33.990]  yeah there's a lot of strings I made cookies live it was we got across some tangy and some grateful
[01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:41.910]  dog see the tangerine dog the look on your face tangerine dog I've been writing down strain names
[01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:45.750]  guys if you have neat strain names you can feel free to tweet those to me at igrow culture I
[01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:49.430]  might use one of them if I use your strain name I might send you a pack of it when I
[01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:57.190]  make it if I remember and if I can find your tweet yeah yeah um but yeah so live res is basically you
[01:13:57.190 --> 01:14:03.110]  know fresh more fresh frozen vho just I think it's a more flavorful purging and I think that's
[01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:07.270]  what I was asking oh yeah vacuum purchase after you know everything I do goes into an oven after
[01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:13.270]  you know you extract it from your system because your system takes um pretty much a good majority
[01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:17.670]  of it out so but you still got to go through your vacuum process to you know keep cleaning and
[01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:23.190]  removing certain gases and stuff like that do you know do you do you do anything special to
[01:14:23.190 --> 01:14:27.990]  your plants or flowers uh if you know you're gonna make oil out of them for live resin um
[01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:39.430]  no um I have done like what was it 48 hours of dark before um but no I really think with as far
[01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:45.350]  as live it's all about the product you put in you know the better you know the flowers that are going
[01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:51.190]  in the better the oil is going to come out so no trim run in this room right yeah I'll pass no trim
[01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:57.510]  run I I honestly like from my trim like my personal stuff I still open blast it and I'll
[01:14:57.510 --> 01:15:02.070]  make it it's you know I think it comes out better than the clothes loop but it's good for patience
[01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:06.950]  people need it but we're snobs over here and uh I'll stick with this nug run yeah the nug run I
[01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:10.710]  can almost tell the difference uh I can almost tell even smoke and shatter I can tell the
[01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:15.110]  difference in nug and earl uh nug run and trim run yeah definitely tell the difference and you
[01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:21.110]  can taste once you start smoking live you can taste the difference between if it's in a closed
[01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:25.670]  loop and if it's not in the closed loop I feel super spoiled now that I smoke so much live it's
[01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:31.430]  like I just it's a good it's a good I find myself hiding my live like just my live resins over here
[01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:35.590]  and the rest of my shatters over there we can smoke this shatter all day the live resin I'll
[01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:40.950]  bark at you like a dog if you get near it yeah all right so a little bit more about the secret
[01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:45.910]  cup stuff dude you're a freaking champion now bro you are a secret cup winner has it sunk in yet
[01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:54.070]  um no well what's funny is about this is I went to what was it secret cup last year when they had
[01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:59.830]  it in Denver um I went with a couple buddies of mine and that was like right when I was really
[01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:06.710]  first getting into really making like oil like more than just you know every now and then um
[01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:11.270]  and I remember telling everybody I was like dude we're gonna enter this cup next year and we're
[01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:16.790]  gonna win it and then you know a year later we fucking oh snap my bad you could say whatever
[01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:20.310]  you want I'm just trying not to say fuck so much that's another dollar actually every time I say
[01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:28.630]  it I owe a dollar to a charity so it's kind of not that bad um and I said we were gonna win it and we
[01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:34.950]  came out and you know and brought I think we came real proper and then a lot of the differences
[01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:40.470]  between I think us which I don't speak for everybody you know I'm saying because I don't
[01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:46.150]  you know I don't know everybody that competed but like we didn't have to source our product
[01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:51.910]  we were able to actually go pick it and I think that made a difference as far as flavor being
[01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:57.190]  able to pick certain flavors and knowing what you want and hash you know it was just easy I would I
[01:16:57.190 --> 01:17:01.910]  would have hated to have to go source you know I'm saying just find something that's good enough
[01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:06.630]  I actually have a guy that comes straight to me for his secret material and yeah he's always like
[01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:10.470]  bro I need it I need this crop at this time and he gives me a heads up. You understand how it is
[01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:17.910]  it's just all about quality for sure for sure um and then I grow weed first before I make hash so
[01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:23.430]  you know it's it's a lot different when you spend 10 weeks with a plant and then make hash instead
[01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:28.870]  of buying it off the shelf and making hash with it it's just it's a lot more full circle yeah um
[01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:33.910]  which is important to us because we say it's grown by us processed by us and you took it by
[01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:40.870]  us seed to live resin to a cup yeah nice that's that's super awesome so it's it's cool it's been
[01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:46.070]  a fun experience hasn't really I don't know if it's sank in because I wasn't you know honestly
[01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:52.630]  I went in with thinking I was gonna have a top three finish that's just how I'm just competitive
[01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:58.630]  I hate losing um so it was cool being able to go in I almost thought I lost once they did
[01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:02.790]  all the awards and then third second I was like oh no we didn't win that's something I wanted to
[01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:08.950]  ask you uh they did they did uh like highest CBD they did best turps they did crowd choice or
[01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:13.110]  something like that uh what was it connoisseur's choice connoisseur's choice and then they do
[01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:19.990]  third second and then big d said so first place and he said something to the equivalent of you
[01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:24.710]  guys already know who it is and I was like oh then it's probably somebody that's already gotten
[01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:29.350]  an award that's what I assumed but then he said garden and as soon as he said garden I think I
[01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:36.470]  peed a little bit myself I was like whoa yeah um he went through and did second place and it was
[01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:40.790]  the bubble which the bubble was fire I'll give it that you know I'm saying um I didn't even know
[01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:46.230]  it was bubbled at one yeah the second place solventless bubble um but I looked at Maddie
[01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:53.110]  and I was like we might not win and then like he did the announcement whatever and it was tight and
[01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:59.110]  I wish I would have I wasn't thinking I was gonna win so like my speech was super like short
[01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:05.590]  and to the point I guess you could say it was well it was perfect you said something about
[01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:09.430]  where you're from this is illegal so it's great to be here with all these people making hash and
[01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:14.550]  celebrating and winning that's pretty pretty awesome you didn't know you were gonna win
[01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:20.150]  no I didn't didn't know I was gonna win um I think I thought I was gonna win but you know
[01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:25.190]  it just came through you know I think we really just put in everything we had into the competition
[01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:31.750]  so it paid off for us were there any other samples that stood out um yeah there was a couple there was
[01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:39.590]  um kind bills the you know shout out to kind bill for you know coming up with the live resin tech
[01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:46.470]  um who made that yeah kind bill who won third is actually the dude who came up with live resin nice
[01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:51.750]  did you beat that guy yeah I know his own when he was talking in his speech he was like there's some
[01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:57.910]  there's some guys out here doing you know my same technique that are killing it um and I'm gonna say
[01:19:57.910 --> 01:20:06.630]  he was regarding me um but yeah his is his was on point uh he did it it was sour d deep chunk and
[01:20:06.630 --> 01:20:12.630]  gorilla glue I think it was just it was really good but it was just too complex it wasn't like
[01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:18.550]  straight to the not straight to the point but just there's like the glue and the sour almost
[01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:23.350]  the same thing and then the deep chunk is I think a sour diesel deep chunk or something like that
[01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:30.470]  it's just a purpley strain um I think if he would have done the sour d and the glue it would have
[01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:34.790]  been a whole it would have came out a whole lot better in my opinion I think the flavors would
[01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:42.470]  have pulled through just that sour with that uh what was it saying gorilla glue is gorilla glue is
[01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:47.990]  basically a old school sour or something like that the gorilla glue is a ridiculous plant bro
[01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:51.910]  yeah that is some crazy shit I've got one growing right now do you got to tie it down and it will
[01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:57.750]  break the tie downs it's like no I literally had one that had I think it started with three tops
[01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:02.790]  and I literally just as it would grow we're just super crop each top down and then now it has like
[01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:09.590]  18 tops I literally have a 10 gallon gorilla glue that has 25 stakes in it I'm gonna have to uh
[01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:14.550]  take a plant out of the room or something because these two gorilla glues are taking more space than
[01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:20.070]  I completely predicted yeah I read who made it the other day on the forum yeah yeah yeah and I
[01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:24.310]  read the cross too and I'm not surprised that it's so killer now that I read it what is it
[01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:28.390]  kim sis sour dub and chocolate tie yeah yeah that's what made me think of it you were talking
[01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:31.670]  about the chocolate I'm taking a dab so you got to talk for a second oh it's cool um

[01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:29.030]  I might have to I usually don't go to Vegas I think I think I think well I was

[01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:40.070]  talking about Vegas I'm gonna have to think about going to Vegas yeah we were looking in the houses
[01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:46.070]  and they today in Vegas like every house is nice it's not just like it's not Pueblo where there's
[01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:53.510]  only one street that has nice houses on it um we uh so we're looking into like getting a house
[01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:58.070]  for like a week because I guess I don't know how long everybody's gonna be there but if we're gonna
[01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:03.190]  get it we'll get it for a week that sleeps like 10 people they all have every house has a pool
[01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:09.990]  and backyards so we'll just go to I'm not gonna I might party like one or two nights
[01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:15.030]  but otherwise I'm just gonna kick it because it's Vegas you'll lose I'll lose too much money in
[01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:20.230]  Vegas yeah Vegas is expensive and it's expensive that's why it's where you can get a house like a
[01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:26.150]  six bedroom house for a week for like 900 bucks for the week oh yeah so that's like 75 bucks a

[01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:11.750]  garden I usually don't enter which is cool yeah which is now I've got 10 weeks to get
[01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:19.350]  all the flavors I want to do for the cup ready to go that's just enough time yeah I've got just
[01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:24.230]  and it's perfect because I have just the right amount of plants that are just big enough they're
[01:30:24.230 --> 01:30:29.910]  outgrowing their threes now so they're ready to go into probably like tens or so and just
[01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:36.630]  finish from now to then and I'll be able to pick what I want when I want it and which flavors we
[01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:42.310]  want to do stoked to see what you enter yeah I get the privilege uh Spence calls me up and he's like
[01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:47.910]  bruh I just ran like seven batches of live I need your expertise I don't know what to enter I go
[01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:52.790]  over there and they heat up the email and Maddie passes me dabs and they won't tell me what they
[01:30:52.790 --> 01:31:03.190]  are but they just watch my reaction and then I go that one bro um no it was definitely a good
[01:31:03.190 --> 01:31:09.350]  experience being able to you know win something it's good for you know I'm not from Colorado I
[01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:15.830]  moved here so like it's cool because I called my parents like yo I just won this hash competition
[01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:21.750]  mom and my mom's like what like what does that mean blah blah blah um so it's it's good to know
[01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:28.470]  that my parent like I'm actually you know progressing you know and getting further into
[01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:35.510]  the scene I guess the weed scene um so it's cool being able to know that out of what 38
[01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:42.390]  people from Colorado or came to Colorado to interhash I had the best hash and that's not
[01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:47.590]  just 38 random people that's invite only you have to get like the secret it's like kumite of hash
[01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:56.390]  you have to be invite um you can't just show up it was a private party for sure private party so
[01:31:56.390 --> 01:32:01.990]  what's uh what's next for the uh the garden of weeden oh other than Vegas other than crushing
[01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:07.830]  Las Vegas and taking home the belt and bringing it to Pueblo Colorado for sure to get it all dusty

[01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:56.150]  social media and you know just networking that you know hopefully if it works out it would be
[01:32:56.150 --> 01:33:01.990]  awesome but um who knows you know we're kind of just doing our thing we don't really you know
[01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:05.590]  especially here in Colorado it's such a legal scene you have to you know you've got to have

[01:41:55.310 --> 01:42:00.910]  i grow culture podcast i had a great long discussion with mike and jesse it starts off
[01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:05.070]  with just some random chatter i decided to hit record i thought i'd leave that in the show
[01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:11.070]  so without further ado here comes the podcast so quite a while ago uh man how many years ago was
[01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:18.590]  it when we had metamar going mike five all right four five six somewhere there i don't know pot pot
[01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:22.670]  so pot years ago between five and eight years ago it was close to seven or eight years ago possibly
[01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:29.230]  by now i don't remember what year it was okay oh eight oh nine okay oh wait it was oh eight so it's
[01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:34.430]  been six years all right so about six years ago mike and i were employed at a dispensary together
[01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:41.310]  i was mostly the dude in charge i managed i bud tended i cleaned i i thought i applied for the
[01:42:41.310 --> 01:42:47.070]  job with you and then like i was told you weren't the manager and then you were the i don't know
[01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:52.510]  that place had structure issues right yeah yeah that's definitely uh i was hired well i was i was
[01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:57.790]  hired as the guy there to help transplant you kept the place from like wandering away like
[01:42:58.350 --> 01:43:02.590]  the customers from like carrying the furniture off and the employees showing up on time and not
[01:43:02.590 --> 01:43:07.790]  stealing everything there were there were a lot of chiefs and no indians and then one day i talked
[01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:12.030]  to the boss and i was like i was straight up with the boss i was like dude you are a great pot grower
[01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:16.030]  you're a good man you've got a good business but honestly you have no idea how to run a damn
[01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:19.790]  business and he kind of laughed at me the way that he did he's a southern guy and he's real
[01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:24.190]  laid back so he just chuckled at me you might be right about that and he handed me the keys to the
[01:43:24.190 --> 01:43:30.030]  shop and he said here you have a dispensary and see what it's like and so man i miss the good old
[01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:35.390]  days don't you so from that day i pretty much had a dispensary and we we rocked that place we did uh
[01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:41.070]  i had days over ten thousand dollars in sales and one day i think of it as the time i had the best
[01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:46.430]  job ever that was the wild wild west it was wonderful it was it was crazy it was definitely
[01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:53.950]  the wild west kids coming in with quarter pounds and backpacks and um boss handing you three edibles
[01:43:53.950 --> 01:43:57.710]  at the beginning of your shift and asking how they tasted four minutes later like yeah dude those are
[01:43:57.710 --> 01:44:01.790]  two we gotta elaborate on both of those topics right we would have people it was heaven people
[01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:07.070]  we would be at work just serving customers cleaning up i would have reggae playing i'd have my laptop
[01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:11.870]  on the desk playing music people would come in uh i'd have a we'd be smoking a joint i had a
[01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:17.310]  vaporizer set up at the bud bar so that well to be fair we usually smoke joints upstairs away from
[01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:22.350]  the customer service area but there was plenty of that downstairs in the beginning i was reckless
[01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:26.670]  and just smoking joints because it was there were no rules there were no rules everybody had a
[01:44:26.670 --> 01:44:30.350]  medical marijuana card we could be smoking medical marijuana so there weren't any things to
[01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:35.790]  worry about right so we're all in there smoking and customers are coming people would show up and
[01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:40.030]  be like hey do you want to check out this sour diesel that i grew and be like i sure do and then
[01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:43.550]  they'd offer it to you i'll give it to you for this much a quarter pound and i'd be like well
[01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:47.710]  you see what we sell at four and eight so you got to give me a deal on that and then we'd get a good
[01:44:47.710 --> 01:44:52.910]  price together and we'd start selling that person's quarter pounds yep so the good old days the good
[01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:57.150]  old days mike would grow a quarter pound and bring it into work and put it on the shelf yep
[01:44:58.990 --> 01:45:03.390]  every employee had something on this shelf that they had arranged and had a little profit cut
[01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:08.030]  of i remember that i don't know mine was little infused candies yeah i of course had herb on the
[01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:12.110]  shelf that i was growing a lot of white rhino and cherry widow was coming from my gardens
[01:45:12.110 --> 01:45:17.870]  you'd be able to so i would take my quarter pound that i grew in my basement and take that to work
[01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:23.230]  sell it to the boss essentially for a specified price and then get an hourly rate to stand there
[01:45:23.230 --> 01:45:27.310]  and sell it to push my product that i just grew so that it'll sell out sooner so that i could
[01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:31.070]  bring another quarter pound back to work tomorrow and make a little more bucks and the boss would
[01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:35.070]  come to you at the end of the day and be like great job we want more of that from you bud
[01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:40.670]  yep everyone's happy yeah so one of the benefits of having that job was i got to see a lot of
[01:45:40.670 --> 01:45:45.790]  cannabis uh and one thing i got one day off every week they made sure to give me after a while we
[01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:49.470]  hired more people i got two days off a week but i had one day off a week and i would spend that one
[01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:56.510]  day i would drive to another city and not be the dispensary employee i would go in as a customer
[01:45:56.510 --> 01:46:00.670]  to as many shops as i could and just go do recon work at all these dispensaries and see what they
[01:46:00.670 --> 01:46:05.310]  had to offer and see how their shops are set up see what who's working there see what the bud
[01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:10.270]  tenders know because i wanted i'm always that guy if i'm doing something i want to be really good at
[01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:14.430]  it i want to be the best uh so i always go well let's see what the best looks like you know let's
[01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:19.790]  go try to see what i want to do and also learn what i do not want to do because i saw we saw a lot
[01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:26.510]  of ways to do it wrong yeah there was so much shit available there are some shops that you can smell
[01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:33.950]  uh that musty hay improperly cured and dried cannabis smell in the waiting room right and
[01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:39.070]  you're like i just want to leave i can already tell that this is going to be b-grade product
[01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:43.790]  right i got my feet wet uh growing commercial cannabis in one of those places
[01:46:47.230 --> 01:46:53.070]  so how uh how challenging is it to go from being an outdoor grower to being like uh you're i want
[01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:57.390]  to call you a caregiver you're an indoor they call us basement growers is what we're labeled
[01:46:57.390 --> 01:47:02.670]  as but you know that's a derogatory term it kind of is but uh if you've got the right basement
[01:47:03.630 --> 01:47:08.750]  yeah it's not that you can't be a really awesome sexy basement grower it's that
[01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:13.630]  it's still sort of a dig yeah yeah i like caregiver private caregiver something along
[01:47:13.630 --> 01:47:18.990]  those lines so how was your how were your changes going from being a caregiver in a residential grow
[01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:27.070]  to having a gigantic commercial grow um i always say it's uh you're on a commercial
[01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:35.310]  grow you're not growing weed you're managing a schedule um it's uh more of a plant management
[01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:39.870]  no fun intended but you know you're trying to keep all the wheels greased and rolling and
[01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:47.870]  functioning properly um and if you start into a grow that didn't have that mindset to begin with
[01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:53.710]  it's quite disastrous so you had to come in and kind of take over for somebody else i had to learn
[01:47:53.710 --> 01:47:59.470]  that from you know i i have no college education the hard way in the middle of it huh yeah yeah
[01:47:59.470 --> 01:48:04.990]  exactly trial by fire yeah yeah sink or swim and also i gotta give you credit because the shop that
[01:48:04.990 --> 01:48:11.470]  you were thrown into uh they did not provide the proper equipment supplies no actually there was
[01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:18.750]  one before that but okay yeah but uh yeah no that one was a joke too did you learn a lot from having
[01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:24.190]  to deal with a joke at least yes oh tremendous learning what not to do is just as beneficial as
[01:48:24.190 --> 01:48:29.470]  learning as learning what to do yeah yeah um sometimes it helps to figure out why you do it
[01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:34.750]  that way by seeing how what happens when it's done wrong yeah some people can only learn that way i've
[01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:39.390]  worked for a few of those people i mean just have to stand back and let it crash i made a completely
[01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:44.350]  amateur mistake the other night uh i've got a gorilla glue plant and it's growing out of control
[01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:49.070]  so i'm sort of it's kind of mainlining but not really because i'm not cleaning everything off i'm
[01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:52.830]  just trying to pull it down i split that bitch right down the middle trying to pull one side
[01:48:52.830 --> 01:49:00.030]  too far from the other uh one piece of duct tape and a twisty tie it was all happy yep but maybe a
[01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:03.950]  little clone gel you know i thought about it but i just thought i panicked and was like i'm just
[01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:08.110]  wrapped this up now get out of here and just quick first aid split it and go yeah she's cool she's
[01:49:08.110 --> 01:49:11.710]  happy four or five days later she's happier she looks stronger there than she did before
[01:49:12.430 --> 01:49:17.630]  so yeah they're hardy made a super new mistake so going on you got something go for it oh i was
[01:49:17.630 --> 01:49:22.430]  just gonna say there's a reason they called it weed yeah i mean it grows like a damn weed if
[01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:28.270]  you do it right uh going to all those dispensaries through i've been to shops from uh pueblo colorado
[01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:34.910]  springs denver uh east and west of denver both directions i haven't gotten up to boulder or fort
[01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:40.270]  collins to the dispensaries but it seems like oh i have but you're no shops in fort collins i was up
[01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:47.390]  a couple in fort collins before they got killed um a long time back in the battle days again
[01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:54.350]  but uh they were about like you'd see everywhere um there are good and bad examples and the good
[01:49:54.350 --> 01:50:00.990]  examples range the spectrum from very cultury to very medical officey and so do the bad ones but
[01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:05.470]  i don't know there's a lot of both do you think that the huge regulation has changed the quality
[01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:15.390]  and product yes and no i think it hurt and helped it um a lot of the incredible growers
[01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:21.790]  couldn't handle the regulation when it first came down and then quality dropped and it stayed
[01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:28.830]  kind of down i don't want to you know bash it too bad but quality dipped for a while when the
[01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:33.790]  best growers were all forced out of the legal industry and it took a while for the people who
[01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:38.590]  were great at business and great at following regulations to catch up with making a great
[01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:44.030]  product well and then also oh sorry no it's cool well there were industry leaders for a while and
[01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:51.070]  i think now solid product is more common than shady product but then again i'm not up at the
[01:50:51.070 --> 01:50:56.030]  shops as often as i'd like to be to say this shit with more confidence right one of the things that
[01:50:56.030 --> 01:51:02.750]  kind of annoys me we made all these regulations to prevent shitty weed pesticides mildew problems
[01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:06.910]  guess what we're still getting it they haven't they don't go inspect the butt at all they just
[01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:10.990]  pay attention to the dollars and the sales they don't care about the products or the safety they
[01:51:10.990 --> 01:51:15.070]  check on the edibles and make sure the edibles are the proper dosage but other than that they
[01:51:15.070 --> 01:51:23.230]  don't really care there isn't a regulatory system for safety inspections for smokables other than
[01:51:23.230 --> 01:51:28.510]  through tobacco and colorado didn't really have that infrastructure and with the food stuff kitchen
[01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:32.990]  safety and all of those rules are already in place and we saw what happened when those first
[01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:39.390]  inspections came out yeah everybody at the table kind of smiled and looked at the sorry aj i was
[01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:44.990]  gonna say they've just recently started enforcing these we saw aj at the secret cup over the weekend
[01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:49.310]  and uh it's good to see him smiling back on his feet his little yoda rig is awesome what's up aj
[01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:53.710]  good to see you brother i hope you listen to the show aj hashman shout out over 100 people got
[01:51:53.710 --> 01:52:00.190]  dinged and it's not like they were doing anything that bad or that wrong it was just their first
[01:52:00.190 --> 01:52:07.630]  taste of what the high-end food quality regulations really look like in a medical edible production
[01:52:07.630 --> 01:52:13.470]  kitchen like even dixie got hit and they're the ones that are like the shiny example in the industry
[01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:21.150]  it's just as the regulations come down the people that were great at following them have to step up
[01:52:21.230 --> 01:52:26.830]  and figure out how to be great at growing weed too because they haven't been practicing for 20
[01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:31.550]  years because they were terrified of breaking the rules that's why they're good at following them now
[01:52:35.070 --> 01:52:39.070]  that's why you can't find my product on the shelf because they changed all those rules yeah i think
[01:52:39.070 --> 01:52:42.990]  when it was all the basement growers and the caregivers doing it in the basement it got taken
[01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:47.230]  into a shop yeah it did because well all the cameras all the regulations all that stuff is
[01:52:47.230 --> 01:52:53.950]  super expensive but the the big expense to start off is the property like unless you can find a
[01:52:53.950 --> 01:53:00.350]  landlord willing to give uncle sam his property to let you live your dream which thanks dad other
[01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:04.830]  than that you ain't finding it um so you gotta buy the property yourself and unless you've got a
[01:53:04.830 --> 01:53:10.590]  million dollars you're not owning a retail property in colorado sir not anywhere other people live
[01:53:10.590 --> 01:53:16.030]  anyway yeah well i know several people that are on the look for property there's always that hunt
[01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:24.270]  raise his hand from a grower's standpoint to um most business or most dispensary owners are more
[01:53:24.270 --> 01:53:29.870]  at this day and age they're more of a business minded person um and like you said know nothing
[01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:34.590]  about growing and they can be incredibly hard to work with from a grower's point of view
[01:53:35.310 --> 01:53:38.830]  you know i wish i would have learned i wish i would have gone to business school instead of
[01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:44.430]  learning to be a super good pot grower i went to business school these regulations are confusing
[01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:51.230]  oh yeah like it ain't the lack of schooling like you're better at business than most of the people
[01:53:51.230 --> 01:53:56.110]  that i went to du business school with and you dropped out of society and went on tour while
[01:53:56.110 --> 01:54:01.470]  they went to college like it doesn't have a lot to do with how well you did in business school
[01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:07.870]  i think the life experience was priceless right now following the regulations is really a question
[01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:13.710]  of are you willing to pay your lawyer you gotta have that capital to have that lawyer because
[01:54:13.710 --> 01:54:19.070]  the weed lawyers are ridiculous right now i don't know this from my perception i'm kind of
[01:54:19.070 --> 01:54:23.870]  from the outside because i really don't do a lot of shop shopping or not as much as i'd like but
[01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:31.710]  the really successful shops that have a handful of locations a reputation for amazing consistent
[01:54:31.710 --> 01:54:39.710]  product are the ones that really invested in a good grower and setting up a grow that that grower
[01:54:39.710 --> 01:54:47.390]  can really run and paid the shit out of that lawyer and their grower and they kept them happy
[01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:54.110]  so many shops died because the grower and the business people got in a pissing contest and
[01:54:54.110 --> 01:54:58.910]  rather than succeed they just peed on each other a bunch one of the most popular dispensaries in
[01:54:58.910 --> 01:55:04.350]  the state does not have their super popular grower and grow team anymore because of recent political
[01:55:04.350 --> 01:55:10.110]  changes they chose to make no i won't call out any names but yeah that was a terrible breakup i
[01:55:10.110 --> 01:55:16.590]  was kind of sad to see that but it did make for some great new opportunities right onward and
[01:55:16.590 --> 01:55:20.590]  upward that's it speaking of onward and upward my mic sounds all echoey do you guys hear that
[01:55:20.590 --> 01:55:26.270]  in the headphones am i echoey to you too yeah yeah tiny bit is it this does that fix it okay it's
[01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:30.430]  because i got your mic turned up real hot there you go all right cool i'm learning how to work
[01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:36.750]  sound equipment only took me 34 episodes all right i may edit part of that out uh so the reason
[01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:41.470]  that mike actually mike and jesse have been contacting me talking to me about this topic
[01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:47.230]  this i was sleeping on this mike thankfully is a super active member of our community uh he goes
[01:55:47.230 --> 01:55:52.430]  to city council meetings he supports cannabis any way that he can jesse works at a hydro shop and
[01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:58.590]  try and is also a farmer a grower and tries to do what he can to stay up on politics um
[01:55:58.830 --> 01:56:02.350]  i don't pay attention to the local news to tell you the truth i just pay attention to the world
[01:56:02.350 --> 01:56:06.670]  and national cannabis news and the state news so luckily mike brought this to my attention and
[01:56:06.670 --> 01:56:10.190]  jesse had some stuff to add to it i put these guys in touch and then they were like we got to get on
[01:56:10.190 --> 01:56:14.350]  the podcast tonight so it was their idea to do a show about this so big shout out to these guys
[01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:20.510]  thank you guys for giving me material yeah sure thank you mike yeah i um i don't know what should
[01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:24.350]  i just start telling the story i kind of took some notes and i've got a little opening an opening
[01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:30.510]  statement if you will it says states let me try that again without a frog in my throat it says
[01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:35.470]  city staff is attempting to draft a new ordinance that would ban all indoor growing in the city of
[01:56:35.470 --> 01:56:40.110]  pueblo they want to make the rules that say they want to make rules that say we have to grow in a
[01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:45.710]  separate building detached from our house and that is bullshit because of many reasons is that pretty
[01:56:45.710 --> 01:56:53.790]  accurate what i wrote there yeah cool not just uh indoor home growing though all home growing so
[01:56:54.510 --> 01:57:01.870]  green no greenhouse in your backyard no just out in your backyard no in your basement no in your
[01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:08.750]  bedroom no little grow cabinet um which means everything at your local hydro store is pretty
[01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:16.590]  much uh pointless because you can't use any of it unless you build a special outbuilding just for
[01:57:16.590 --> 01:57:22.270]  your six personal cannabis plants which is ridiculous how many of us can afford to build
[01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:26.990]  a special outbuilding just for our cannabis plants i have six of them the hot topic in the
[01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:33.550]  chieftain the last couple of weeks has been revolving around most people in this well not
[01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:37.310]  most people in the city several people in the city not being able to afford trash service
[01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:43.790]  electricity payments things like this and we're talking about having people build a special
[01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:51.870]  airtight smell proof building so they can grow six pot plants well technically three because
[01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:57.390]  you're only allowed three in bloom at one time so you'd only have three stinky flowering plants
[01:57:57.390 --> 01:58:03.630]  in that building ever at once this would also affect caregivers he's using uh 64 as reference
[01:58:03.630 --> 01:58:10.270]  but it would also affect caregivers thank you so it would just be uh it would affect everybody in
[01:58:10.270 --> 01:58:14.670]  the city outside so you can't do it isn't that gonna make it easier to steal harder to take
[01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:18.430]  care of it's gonna be another building you're gonna have to get a building permit you're gonna
[01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:22.670]  need to wire that building well the pet well everybody in the neighborhood would know that
[01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:27.310]  that's why the six people on the block or in the neighborhood or whatever just built that special
[01:58:27.310 --> 01:58:33.870]  new building behind their house you'd have to own your said property it's uh the first place my mind
[01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:39.550]  went is it's a huge kick to black hills because everybody who's been using a greenhouse or
[01:58:39.550 --> 01:58:45.230]  following the very letter of the law and just chain linking their plants into a cage and essentially
[01:58:45.230 --> 01:58:51.310]  growing them purely outdoors in their backyard but in an enclosed locked space now you've got
[01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:58.270]  to put them under expensive grow lights with fancy you know air filtration equipment and all of that
[01:58:58.270 --> 01:59:03.550]  is just a huge give to black hills now you said that you had an idea of why this ordinance was
[01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:11.790]  being drafted so a couple weeks ago and i'm the city council policy nerd i go attend just about
[01:59:11.790 --> 01:59:18.670]  every meeting um i was there uh two weeks ago listening to the interviews for the new city
[01:59:18.670 --> 01:59:25.230]  council seat and then for the budgetary meeting they had after that and during the budgetary
[01:59:25.230 --> 01:59:30.110]  meeting just sort of offhandedly a couple of the council members referenced a complaint they had
[01:59:30.110 --> 01:59:36.750]  all received the previous week from a homeowner on the south side who's an elderly gentleman and
[01:59:36.750 --> 01:59:42.590]  wakes up every day to the stink of marijuana plants and now everybody's sitting at this table
[01:59:42.590 --> 01:59:47.230]  is like you asked why'd you say stink well it's because that's how this old guy sees it that's
[01:59:47.230 --> 01:59:54.430]  how what he called city council about and being city council and not having a whole lot um to do
[01:59:54.430 --> 02:00:00.350]  other than please your constituents and you know respond to stuff like this a number of them drove
[02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:09.950]  to this guy's house and gave it a smell and um sandy daff said it was a very strong from the
[02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:14.030]  driveway she pulled up into this gentleman's house so next she pulls up next door and she
[02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:20.190]  can smell this guy's garden um steve naraki said that he didn't really smell it but when he was
[02:00:20.190 --> 02:00:24.510]  standing in the backyard he could clearly see several plants over the top of a privacy fence
[02:00:25.070 --> 02:00:29.390]  so you know it gives you an idea how big this caregiver was doing in his backyard
[02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:33.950]  and it doesn't sound like he's meeting all of the basic city code stuff because they weren't
[02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:40.350]  enclosed or locked they were just in his backyard but uh the cops have been out at this guy's house
[02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:44.750]  his neighbors are pissed like would any of you ever stink out your neighbors like this
[02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:52.350]  like it's it's a pretty easy way to bring problems on yourself like if i would be embarrassed if my
[02:00:52.350 --> 02:00:56.590]  neighbors smelled me every morning as an indoor grower i try to be really covert my neighbors
[02:00:56.590 --> 02:01:00.670]  i'm certain my neighbors know what i do because they've seen me carrying things they see my
[02:01:00.670 --> 02:01:05.470]  dreadlocks they know who i am uh they've seen my facebook they probably listen to the podcast
[02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:10.110]  one of my neighbors one of my neighbors was a vendor i don't know what he sold exactly but he
[02:01:10.110 --> 02:01:16.430]  brought me a large box of lighters fresh lighters like just he's like i'm pretty sure you guys smoke
[02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:21.550]  you want some lighters and that big gigantic box over there is that's all lighters dude i'm serious
[02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:27.070]  so my neighbors know what's up but i still i don't i try to keep it on the they're not calling
[02:01:27.070 --> 02:01:31.630]  city council on you saying you're a bad neighbor because they don't wake up like i would be
[02:01:31.630 --> 02:01:37.790]  mortified like clearly my mother did not raise whoever's growing these pot plants but um you know
[02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:41.230]  so city council went out there and during the meeting the other night they mentioned sort of
[02:01:41.230 --> 02:01:46.350]  offhandedly that they had all received this complaint and they all agreed that this guy
[02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:50.110]  should be able to wake up in the morning and not smell his neighbor's pot plants
[02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:54.830]  and they didn't really say anything else about it they kind of chuckled about the smell and
[02:01:55.470 --> 02:01:59.550]  contact high got thrown around a little bit and they went on to they were busy they were going
[02:01:59.550 --> 02:02:04.510]  over budgetary stuff and the city's millions of dollars in the hole so it got dropped pretty
[02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:10.990]  quick and um you know being who i am and doing what i do all day when i read the article in the
[02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:18.590]  chieftain today i called every city council member in pueblo and three of them called me
[02:02:18.590 --> 02:02:23.870]  back today and discussed this issue and all of them said that this isn't something that they
[02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:30.110]  asked for or that they're aware that any other council person asked for rather it's something
[02:02:30.110 --> 02:02:37.150]  the city staff has put together based on those off-handed comments at the council meeting the
[02:02:37.150 --> 02:02:42.670]  other night so this is all the brainchild of somebody in planning and zoning who's attempting
[02:02:42.670 --> 02:02:50.190]  to please his bosses who might not or whom he decided might want to weed can't smell weed in
[02:02:50.190 --> 02:02:56.990]  pueblo type ordinance um the city council people i talked to all use the word unenforceable or all
[02:02:56.990 --> 02:03:03.070]  agreed that any sort of ordinance that covered growing pot in a basement or in a garage like all
[02:03:03.070 --> 02:03:06.910]  of that is unenforceable they can't send somebody to every house in pueblo and check
[02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:11.710]  so essentially if you're not being a jerk and stinking up your neighbor to begin with
[02:03:12.270 --> 02:03:16.510]  there'd be no way for them to find you making this totally pointless so i don't see it really
[02:03:16.510 --> 02:03:23.710]  going anywhere but regardless um everybody who gives a shit needs to show up on the 13th at 7
[02:03:23.710 --> 02:03:30.910]  p.m at the city council building down on union and grand you're the city council guy you should
[02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:34.830]  be telling me don't look at me with a question mark i drive i drive there without thinking at
[02:03:34.830 --> 02:03:38.510]  this point yeah i'm pretty sure it's you need to go i will tweet the correct address what mike is
[02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:44.350]  saying guys we want to go on october 13th to city council and tell them that this proposed idea
[02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:48.830]  is unacceptable and that it will not work for us right while you were talking i came up with
[02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:54.510]  an alternative a cannabis courtesy law it's like a don't ask don't tell but if we can smell it you
[02:03:54.510 --> 02:04:01.790]  got to turn it down that's a cannabis courtesy that i'd like to see more of a public service
[02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:06.430]  announcement that's like don't be a fucking asshole yeah sorry for you can say you can say
[02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:12.030]  that i'm not charging you a dollar but like it's it's a common courtesy thing i would be mortified
[02:04:12.030 --> 02:04:15.710]  is the word i would use to describe it not embarrassed not ashamed fucking mortified if
[02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:20.750]  my neighbor smelled me every morning yeah and if you're growing 30 or 40 cannabis plants as a
[02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:26.270]  caregiver you're putting yourself at risk your patient's medicine at risk just having that
[02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:31.950]  wafting down the alley like we already had one kid get shot in the stomach with an air rifle
[02:04:31.950 --> 02:04:37.390]  this summer because someone's too stupid to put their shit in a fence if you throw a chain link
[02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:41.630]  fence over it teenagers aren't gonna bother they can barely work scissors little on freaking wire
[02:04:41.630 --> 02:04:45.630]  cutters most of them are so lazy that they're not ready to steal unless it's right in their face
[02:04:45.630 --> 02:04:51.870]  anyway right if you're growing in town don't don't push the limits you know i think that's the
[02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:58.830]  thing we're getting at but right like all of this is because one guy's being inconsiderate yes yeah
[02:04:58.830 --> 02:05:02.990]  so we're all gonna get punished for that that kind of sucks everybody who would like to grow their
[02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:08.750]  own cannabis plants in the city of pueblo now has that right in jeopardy because one jerk on the
[02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:13.550]  south side is stinking up his neighbor's house but two jerks because somebody had to shoot somebody
[02:05:13.550 --> 02:05:20.030]  also and i'm sure that contributes that's surely not helping anybody and there's another jerk out
[02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:27.790]  in uh this uh county i almost said too much of the neighborhood but he he's the the main thing for
[02:05:28.590 --> 02:05:33.070]  um the county kind of doing the same thing that they're wanting to do the same thing that the
[02:05:33.070 --> 02:05:37.870]  city's going to do or try to do no the county's talking about proposed plant limits is that right
[02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:44.910]  they they are talking limits but um regardless of uh caregiver ship or anything like that it would
[02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:56.190]  be uh shit i can't 18 plants yeah uh 18 plants per single family residence 12 plants per apartment
[02:05:56.190 --> 02:06:05.310]  or multi-family residence um and it uh limits uh or forbids outdoor growing too so that's you know
[02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:11.150]  that's ridiculous especially in the county the forbidding of outdoor growing is just a silly
[02:06:11.150 --> 02:06:18.910]  gift to black hills that they don't deserve yeah the sun is free abundant energy and plants are
[02:06:18.910 --> 02:06:24.270]  meant to be outdoors and the only reason marijuana was forced indoors to begin with was prohibition
[02:06:25.150 --> 02:06:30.030]  um i don't know about you guys but i love some summer outdoor yeah man you say a lot of ridiculous
[02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:33.790]  shit but that thing you just said about the only reason marijuana was forced indoors was because
[02:06:33.790 --> 02:06:38.030]  of prohibition is one of the greatest things i've ever heard you say every now and then a
[02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:42.350]  diamond flies it falls out along with all the coal yeah dude yeah you're kind of full of crap but once
[02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:46.910]  in a while you spit out a real gem that was and i agree with you and a lot of people moved to
[02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:52.590]  colorado to the pueblo area to grow outdoors because this is an ideal climate there's the
[02:06:52.590 --> 02:06:58.350]  reason that uh most of the army uh troops that have been to afghanistan and iraq uh go through
[02:06:58.350 --> 02:07:02.910]  fort carson for training before they go there yeah it gets them acclimated to the similar
[02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:07.230]  environment we're up this altitude the air is thin the temperature is the same yeah the hindu
[02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:11.390]  kush valley oh does that mean that when uh when they take over and they all come here that they're
[02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:18.670]  coming to pueblo shit colorado is my favorite place on the planet before we legalize it gets
[02:07:18.670 --> 02:07:23.550]  beautiful here the weather is gorgeous the climate's wonderful the summers are amazing the
[02:07:23.550 --> 02:07:28.590]  food here is great belay the sweet corn people you don't know what you're missing the people are
[02:07:28.590 --> 02:07:33.790]  great in colorado right people are pretty chill when family comes to visit they always comment on
[02:07:33.790 --> 02:07:40.670]  how nice the drivers are we'll be driving up the highway and 30 people will shift it lanes
[02:07:40.670 --> 02:07:46.270]  all in unison to let a semi who's slow up the on-ramp on and the dude from new york will go
[02:07:46.270 --> 02:07:52.830]  what the fuck was that man what are you guys doing we're not being dicks in unison isn't it amazing
[02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:57.070]  we didn't have to orchestrate or communicate or nothing we just all weren't dicks at the same
[02:07:57.070 --> 02:08:01.870]  time somebody was telling me a story about the cannabis cup uh another person was in from out
[02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:07.470]  of state i think new york somewhere upstate where they talked all crazy they spoke all crazy uh but
[02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:11.950]  she said the friend that told me the story said he was walking up and down the aisles going i can't

[02:08:17.470 --> 02:08:23.310]  friendly and polite colorado people are one of the things i see on the internet a lot is uh people
[02:08:23.310 --> 02:08:27.790]  looking to come here and check out our legal weed scene worried they're gonna be embarrassed and
[02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:34.990]  cause problems or get grief from locals if they come here and get excited about legal weed no

[02:10:22.590 --> 02:10:29.230]  on somebody's documentary somewhere i would love to see where that went i had some pictures on my
[02:10:29.230 --> 02:10:34.830]  old phone that went for a swim you sent me the great one of my best uh instagram and twitter
[02:10:34.830 --> 02:10:40.190]  photos ever came was actually taken by our good friend jesse the one where the reporter is filming
[02:10:40.190 --> 02:10:43.310]  me and interviewing me and then our buddy walter is standing there looking like
[02:10:44.670 --> 02:10:50.430]  that photo was taken by you actually it's a great shot yeah no that was a really cool day that was
[02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:55.390]  a real that's a memorable day i remember a lot of stuff from that day for sure oh i forgot a lot
[02:10:55.390 --> 02:11:02.110]  of stuff from that day too but so i was first i bought weed first and then i came home and met up
[02:11:02.110 --> 02:11:06.510]  with my buddy that i did another podcast with back in the day and him and i went back out there
[02:11:06.510 --> 02:11:10.110]  and took our recording devices and went and had a little bit of fun out there for that
[02:11:10.110 --> 02:11:14.910]  and by then uh i was already well known as the first guy that bought pot i don't know how
[02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:18.750]  everybody knew already it'd only been three or four hours there wasn't a lot to talk about in
[02:11:18.750 --> 02:11:25.950]  that line so the news actually came to my house and filmed us mike and i and another friend here
[02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:30.750]  hanging out smoking nice and put that on the news yeah i got a little over excited with my
[02:11:30.750 --> 02:11:38.030]  first legal weed purchase as just an adult and yeah that was fun i'm glad that uh they were way
[02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:43.710]  more fascinated with the dreadlocks and the dab rig than they were with the pasty white guy in
[02:11:43.710 --> 02:11:48.750]  the corner i took uh i took two or three dabs when the camera crew was here and uh they put
[02:11:48.750 --> 02:11:54.430]  the tiny shitty weak dab on the news oh yeah i was like oh you could have put a real fat dab on
[02:11:54.430 --> 02:11:58.590]  the news if i remember right they didn't even actually put the whole dab on either no yeah
[02:11:58.590 --> 02:12:03.710]  it was just just me blowing it out i think by then the camera guy was a little lit
[02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:10.110]  it wasn't his fault we got carried away and sort of hot box this room real fast
[02:12:11.550 --> 02:12:17.550]  there was a reporter expecting it a video camera guy and a still camera lady and the still camera
[02:12:17.550 --> 02:12:21.470]  lady was talking about how she wished she could smoke but they drug test her so i was making sure
[02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:27.790]  to blow a little smoke right in her face you know they did a beat fucking straight to wendy's when
[02:12:28.670 --> 02:12:34.110]  the reporter lady uh she started off like next to me asking questions like so tell me about this
[02:12:34.110 --> 02:12:38.510]  tell me about this she finished a report from the middle of the living room she was gone and she
[02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:42.670]  went all she was hiding by the way out of her room yelling questions she had the front door open
[02:12:42.670 --> 02:12:48.030]  getting air and shit and tell me more about cannabis it was so funny hilarious i see her
[02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:52.830]  every other week at council meetings and she's always a real sweetheart and tries to block me
[02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:58.190]  out of her shot of whoever's speaking just by fate lines us up if she was if she wanted to she
[02:12:58.190 --> 02:13:03.230]  could tip her camera up a degree and a half and have my dumb mug in every background shot but she
[02:13:03.230 --> 02:13:07.710]  cuts me out and i appreciate it yeah well you've been seen as the guy smoking bud here at the house
[02:13:07.710 --> 02:13:12.670]  you don't need to be the guy on city council also that'll look weird yeah i wish they'd wear a lot
[02:13:12.670 --> 02:13:19.150]  of hats i wish they would do that he's our lobbyist he's doing well for us he's the one that got this
[02:13:19.150 --> 02:13:24.110]  important news on the air i cleans up real good yeah this whole this all started when a reporter
[02:13:24.110 --> 02:13:28.990]  from the chiefman sent me an email how he got my email i have no earthly idea but i woke up to
[02:13:29.710 --> 02:13:35.950]  uh can you please find us someone from the cannabis using uh community that wants to comment
[02:13:35.950 --> 02:13:44.910]  on the city council attempting to ban all home growing and i went wait what that's news to me and
[02:13:44.910 --> 02:13:50.350]  yeah it seems like well yeah the story we just told a little stone so i'm kind of backtracking
[02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:54.350]  but no that's cool we need to uh remind the people that what's going to happen is the draft will be
[02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:59.550]  presented on october 15th to the city council what we've got to do is go to the city council
[02:13:59.550 --> 02:14:04.110]  meeting on the 13th and kind of be preemptive show them look we know this is coming we're here
[02:14:04.110 --> 02:14:09.710]  to influence you first come up with good reasons why it's bullshit and if you have if you got a
[02:14:09.710 --> 02:14:13.550]  speaking voice if you're not scared to speak in front of people go speak to the city council
[02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:18.750]  it's a public forum explain to them that they can't make us grow in private buildings because
[02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:22.910]  first that tells the robbers right where our weed is second that tells your neighbors that you are
[02:14:22.910 --> 02:14:28.510]  actually growing cannabis if they didn't already know third you can't afford a damn building four
[02:14:28.510 --> 02:14:32.510]  that's going to make more electricity for black hills to go wire up that should be number one
[02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:38.510]  okay see all these reasons already add up second of all what are we doing wrong there's a couple
[02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:42.910]  of people screwing up right go make those people correct their things don't punish the whole group
[02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:47.310]  for a couple of people screw ups this does nothing to go over the actor try to attack the
[02:14:47.310 --> 02:14:52.990]  actual criminal element that does happen from some home growth it's kind of nitpicking isn't it right
[02:14:52.990 --> 02:14:58.830]  well the person growing weed in their home on the black market for sale on the black market isn't
[02:14:58.830 --> 02:15:03.070]  bothering to follow any of the rules and they're doing so they're doing everything covertly because
[02:15:03.070 --> 02:15:07.710]  they don't want to get caught and arrested the people who are standing up following the letter
[02:15:07.710 --> 02:15:12.190]  of the law but being dickish about it are just bringing a black guy to the whole community and
[02:15:12.190 --> 02:15:18.910]  causing everybody problems if we legalize it if enough idiots screw up they're gonna take that
[02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:26.910]  away the next president could send the fucking marines like it's not that outlandish vision in
[02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:33.310]  my head was just like president romney will remember in boston bomb oh that is don't ever see
[02:15:33.310 --> 02:15:39.150]  that your outdoor garden will get droned in boston if we're not careful there was a manhunt
[02:15:39.790 --> 02:15:44.430]  after the boston marathon bombings they were going into every single house and searching
[02:15:44.430 --> 02:15:50.750]  every single room looking for these suspects yep um imagine if they tried to do that here i mean
[02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:55.550]  that was you know i mean no i'm yeah no that wouldn't happen in colorado that only will happen
[02:15:55.550 --> 02:15:59.150]  on the east coast we're one of the most armed states there is i mean imagine that type of
[02:15:59.150 --> 02:16:06.350]  shit going on they'll such a bizarre state very liberal and very gun friendly i don't know anyone
[02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:11.070]  who grew up here that can't like didn't grow up shooting the guns go well with the liberalness
[02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:16.030]  yeah because you have to be able to protect yourself being so liberal you have to well
[02:16:16.030 --> 02:16:21.150]  there's a lot of places where you can fully get eaten by a bear still like that's a thing here
[02:16:21.150 --> 02:16:26.270]  30 minutes from here you can be eaten by several things 30 minutes from here hell they found a
[02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:30.830]  moose down in the river earlier this summer that's one of the most deadly creatures in north america
[02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:34.510]  and people do not respect the moose nope it does not have big
[02:16:34.510 --> 02:16:37.790]  fangs now so they don't get afraid of the knuckle part of it
[02:16:40.110 --> 02:16:43.870]  let's give a shout out to jesse for a moose knuckle reference on the show that was pretty good
[02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:49.550]  i don't know can we transition from moose knuckle to let me just finish it with saying i'm not too
[02:16:49.550 --> 02:16:55.790]  afraid to get up get beat up by a nice moose knuckle now let's go to the part you were gonna do
[02:16:55.790 --> 02:17:04.830]  um as i blush and rub my face a little um i need more weed so one of the things that just
[02:17:04.830 --> 02:17:08.670]  kills me i'd like to give you i'd like to give you a dab but on the show you're gonna choke for
[02:17:08.670 --> 02:17:12.750]  like 30 minutes give me the tiniest little baby girly dab start talking while i get them ready
[02:17:12.750 --> 02:17:17.230]  i'll take one first and by the time you're done i'll have a couple dabs going so uh one of the
[02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:23.710]  things that kills me about the cannabis community is for the last 80 years or so we've been forced
[02:17:23.710 --> 02:17:28.830]  underground and into the dark and then out of the way and out of sight and that's how we've
[02:17:28.830 --> 02:17:35.950]  survived and that's how we've thrived but now that it's legal more of us need to stand the
[02:17:35.950 --> 02:17:44.590]  fuck up and show up to city council and show up to vote and show up during budget meetings and
[02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:49.630]  have our voices heard we're used to hiding and pretending like we're not part of the system
[02:17:50.350 --> 02:17:59.310]  and we're against the system but we live here too it's our city too we're we have just as much
[02:17:59.310 --> 02:18:06.990]  right to have our city be like we would like it as anyone else in the city and if nobody shows up
[02:18:07.710 --> 02:18:12.990]  and speaks out against a ban on all home growing that requires you to build a building
[02:18:13.710 --> 02:18:19.070]  city council's not gonna care that it's ridiculous and unenforceable and a horrible idea
[02:18:19.710 --> 02:18:25.550]  they're gonna go ahead and approve it because without thinking about it just on a quick gut
[02:18:25.550 --> 02:18:30.270]  check it seems like you ought to have the right to wake up in the morning and not smell marijuana
[02:18:30.270 --> 02:18:36.990]  and this ordinance might do that once for somebody maybe so sure go ahead and approve it and if
[02:18:36.990 --> 02:18:42.350]  nobody's willing to throw on some clean clothes and show up monday night at seven o'clock and say
[02:18:42.350 --> 02:18:48.510]  hey i think this is a really bad idea and i'd appreciate you not passing this ordinance
[02:18:49.310 --> 02:18:54.350]  who knows what's gonna happen i mean i think they're gonna kill it i think that if i show up
[02:18:54.350 --> 02:19:00.270]  and one or two other people show up and speak that they'll go ahead and kill it on the 15th or next
[02:19:00.270 --> 02:19:05.310]  month or whatever but who knows nobody's willing to stand up and that's part of the reason pueblo
[02:19:05.310 --> 02:19:12.270]  city doesn't have any medical shops in it or any rec shops yet because so far it's just me down at
[02:19:12.270 --> 02:19:17.550]  city council saying we ought to have these for a minute we had a little cannabis community group
[02:19:17.550 --> 02:19:22.510]  but they fell apart pretty quick quite quickly like you don't need a group though you just
[02:19:22.510 --> 02:19:28.030]  you just need to be a citizen who's willing to show up monday night at seven so here's something
[02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:34.350]  that i've kind of tossed around in my head uh when when mike and i had a shop together it was owned by
[02:19:34.350 --> 02:19:38.590]  somebody else but you know we ran that place there were a couple times we had to go to court for a
[02:19:38.590 --> 02:19:44.110]  couple of things and uh to support a member of our group that had a court trial also we went to
[02:19:44.110 --> 02:19:50.990]  a couple of city council things to try to speak up i look like your tip i i know it i look like
[02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:57.790]  a cliche freaking pothead that's cool it's an email on a mic cord no problem just a little
[02:19:57.790 --> 02:20:01.390]  plastic it's not the first it's not the first time that's happened to tell you the truth i had to
[02:20:01.390 --> 02:20:07.150]  learn how to take dabs with a mic in front of me also so i'm talking about i used to go to those uh
[02:20:07.150 --> 02:20:12.830]  city council meetings and then i'm saying i'm six foot five with dreadlocks to my ass dude my
[02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:18.030]  dreadlocks go past my ass now i've got four foot ropes hanging off of my head he does people i'm
[02:20:18.030 --> 02:20:23.070]  not kidding yeah and there's nowhere to hide them and even if i put on a collared shirt and i look
[02:20:23.070 --> 02:20:28.350]  good i've still got these brasta man dreadlocks dr carl hart feels your pain sir i feel uh
[02:20:30.110 --> 02:20:36.190]  there's i'm almost a detriment to the community when i go to city council meetings and show
[02:20:36.270 --> 02:20:40.910]  like look here's rasta man here that i feel like i'm a weight on the community when i show up i
[02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:49.150]  kind of hide because of that i would say that you're a self-employed successful citizen of
[02:20:49.150 --> 02:20:54.750]  our beautiful city and have as much of a right to stand up and claim your piece of it is the best
[02:20:54.750 --> 02:21:01.710]  dressed cleanest shaved mother fucker in here i was just gonna say fuck yeah all right like
[02:21:02.430 --> 02:21:10.750]  you don't have to change who you are to stand up and be part of city government everybody gets a
[02:21:10.750 --> 02:21:16.670]  vote everybody gets to say period the rules of this the city council meetings anyone who comes
[02:21:16.670 --> 02:21:22.750]  and signs up um to speak before the meeting they usually limit it to six but they've been allowing
[02:21:22.750 --> 02:21:27.870]  more than six people to speak at the beginning of most meetings lately because of uh all the hubbub
[02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:34.110]  and the recall stuff but uh if you show up to speak you can you get your five minutes as long
[02:21:34.110 --> 02:21:38.590]  as you're not cussing or throwing things you can say whatever you want and there's these old
[02:21:38.590 --> 02:21:45.950]  crotchety people that show up and bitch about whatever their passion issue is every two weeks
[02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:50.910]  at every single meeting they take five minutes at the beginning of the meeting to stand up and say
[02:21:50.910 --> 02:21:56.590]  i don't like any of you i hate what you're doing i need all of you to stop right now it's illegal
[02:21:56.590 --> 02:22:00.590]  i hate you but he takes five minutes to do that at the beginning of every meeting and he sits down
[02:22:00.590 --> 02:22:07.710]  in his crotchety friend gets up and does the same thing and they're not any more valid or legitimate
[02:22:07.710 --> 02:22:12.830]  than you with your dreadlocks or jesse with his beard or me with my earrings just because i clean
[02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:17.870]  up a little better than y'all as far as the cops are concerned doesn't mean you deserve less or
[02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:23.550]  more space in city council than i take the only reason they talk to me is because i show up all
[02:22:23.550 --> 02:22:29.470]  the time and i'm familiar face most people leave halfway through the meeting and then it's just
[02:22:29.470 --> 02:22:35.630]  the people that are stuck there playing a role in going through the pageantry of city government and
[02:22:35.630 --> 02:22:41.470]  because i'm willing to hang out for that last hour i can call city council on two o'clock in
[02:22:41.470 --> 02:22:46.030]  the afternoon and by eight o'clock i've talked to three of them personally for like 15 minutes each
[02:22:46.990 --> 02:22:53.630]  i'm a fucking stoner too like i'm just willing to stand up and claim my little spot at the table
[02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:59.070]  i like it my other question is am i gonna attract unwanted attention to myself like i'm not doing
[02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:03.230]  anything i shouldn't be but am i going and speaking out as a weed head looking like a weed head
[02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:10.270]  not bringing weed head trouble to myself the the cops are too busy to especially give a shit yeah
[02:23:10.270 --> 02:23:15.230]  um a friend of mine likes to tell a story a girlfriend got mad at him and called the cops and
[02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:20.190]  said my boyfriend's growing too much weed and the cop went weed and hung up the phone
[02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:27.710]  we've got heroin falling off the truck here we've got a teen pregnancy rate that rivals most
[02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:34.510]  county's high school graduation rates like cops are busy the kids that's going to city council
[02:23:34.510 --> 02:23:39.630]  with dreadlocks and standing up saying i don't like this ordinance please don't vote for it
[02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:44.750]  is not someone they need to worry about now if you show up and throw a rock at sandy daff
[02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:48.270]  they're probably gonna pay attention to who you are and follow you out of the building and give
[02:23:48.270 --> 02:23:54.030]  you a lot of problems but if you stand up and act like a citizen they will treat you like a citizen
[02:23:55.230 --> 02:24:00.670]  because doing so anything else is technically a crime can i wear a hat in the courtroom yep nice
[02:24:01.390 --> 02:24:07.390]  you took my dreads up in there people show up in pajamas um the trash haulers are down there a lot
[02:24:07.390 --> 02:24:14.190]  a lot of them come straight from work um i'm in iraqi works full-time is a mail carrier and
[02:24:14.190 --> 02:24:20.670]  more often than not is in her work uniform like um even montoya shows up in a t-shirt
[02:24:20.670 --> 02:24:28.990]  nine meetings out of ten um i mean if someone on the council is in a t-shirt you should feel fine
[02:24:28.990 --> 02:24:35.710]  in a grassroots hat keeping your dreadlocks out of your face like that's a lot of us he's talking
[02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:42.270]  to you guys it's really boring i it's it's city government it's a lot of people mumbling about
[02:24:42.350 --> 02:24:48.990]  really hyper specific rules and it's sort of bore yourself to tears dull but it affects your life
[02:24:49.550 --> 02:24:55.550]  on a number of in a number of ways regularly and right now they're looking to kill countless small
[02:24:55.550 --> 02:25:02.910]  businesses and every caregiver in the in the city limits with a dumb rule trying to kill smells
[02:25:02.910 --> 02:25:07.390]  we just wrote them a pretty nice little sales tax check for our first quarter of business
[02:25:07.390 --> 02:25:12.990]  right for uh which business uh high grow pueblo growing supplies so how often are you at high
[02:25:12.990 --> 02:25:18.430]  girl indoor growing supplies uh a lot more lately cool so more frequently not to derail
[02:25:18.430 --> 02:25:22.350]  mike's subject here but guys a lot of people want to talk to jesse about growing stuff
[02:25:22.350 --> 02:25:26.590]  from the show uh catch him at high girl indoor growing supplies distract him so that he can't
[02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:29.790]  get his work done it's much more fun to stand there and help you guys out than it is to stack
[02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:33.950]  if you bring tabs down that's a good way to distract me real good
[02:25:37.550 --> 02:25:43.150]  oh it's such a good thing you're the boss no no i'm not well we've got to say that you are
[02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:46.110]  if you're taking dabs while you're working i'm just above the law oh
[02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:54.430]  so guys come to city if you live in pueblo colorado uh is it just city or does the county count if
[02:25:54.430 --> 02:26:00.190]  you're part of the county come out to all of this stuff affects you guys if if the city bans all
[02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:07.310]  home growing the county is going to experience a mass exodus of cannabis caregivers into the county
[02:26:07.310 --> 02:26:13.150]  and with the fit they've been pitching over one weed farm out and whatever that road is i don't
[02:26:13.150 --> 02:26:19.950]  imagine they'd like the 3 000 plus caregivers that live in pueblo county and have since the medical
[02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:27.950]  where medical marijuana program started publishing that information about a decade ago like all these
[02:26:27.950 --> 02:26:30.990]  people are gonna have to pack their shit up and take it to the county and the county ain't ready
[02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:35.550]  to handle that so county folks show up and say this is a terrible idea i'm a well-established
[02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:40.750]  caregiver i've been caregiving for five or six years professionally i call myself a professional
[02:26:40.750 --> 02:26:46.670]  caregiver i do very well at it my patients love my products right uh they count on it they rely on it
[02:26:47.310 --> 02:26:53.310]  um i have got a system designed where i can provide exactly what they need i know when my
[02:26:53.310 --> 02:26:58.110]  patients are going to call i know when i know when my old friend i know exactly when he's going to
[02:26:58.110 --> 02:27:03.790]  run out i know when everybody i've got them scheduled to have to redo my grow to build
[02:27:03.790 --> 02:27:09.950]  another building would cause me to have to leave this town which would put five people that i'm
[02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:16.030]  responsible for in some deep shit with their cannabis needs yeah i would and where are they
[02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:19.390]  going to get it because there's not there aren't going to be any other caregivers to take my spot
[02:27:19.390 --> 02:27:25.150]  because they can't grow in their indoor environment like not everybody's got a breeding facility
[02:27:25.150 --> 02:27:31.950]  somewhere else to work with some of us have to right some of us have to stick to the basement
[02:27:32.590 --> 02:27:41.230]  not to mention i mean just the the loss of revenue um i i think amendment 64 is even with pueblo um
[02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:49.630]  at every corner they've been able to stop being having retail stores and grows uh in city limits
[02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:57.390]  pueblo still prospered from amendment 64 you know in in in small ways but you know all the secondary
[02:27:57.390 --> 02:28:02.910]  employment that has come from 64 pueblo still enjoying all the electricians the plumbers the
[02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:07.630]  caregivers you know the growth store people moving here grows what makes a lot of money from us
[02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:13.230]  yeah i mean you can't lie jesse just said they wrote a nice tax check i wish there was a higher
[02:28:13.230 --> 02:28:19.310]  profit margin on it but the last depression the one gross store on fourth street sprung up what
[02:28:19.310 --> 02:28:25.550]  three new locations and two new competitors bloomed yeah the public ain't that big folks and
[02:28:25.550 --> 02:28:31.950]  we've got four now there are five or six hydro six hydro shots driving distance of here right and
[02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:38.670]  and they're all surviving just fine because there's a lot of employment bleeding off this
[02:28:38.670 --> 02:28:42.670]  industry yeah i'm gonna do a shameless plug right here i've been to all of the hydro shops in this
[02:28:42.670 --> 02:28:48.910]  town that's no doubt at all all of them several times and there's a reason why i've chosen one
[02:28:48.910 --> 02:28:56.510]  specific shop to be my sponsor yeah nice i was almost out there today just by happenstance i
[02:28:56.510 --> 02:29:01.390]  needed something and that was what dawned on me is the place to go yeah we're gonna have to work
[02:29:01.390 --> 02:29:05.550]  out some kind of coupon code or something for the agricultural listeners i've been thinking that
[02:29:05.550 --> 02:29:10.350]  too yeah if right now just off the top if you mentioned that you listen to this show and you're
[02:29:10.350 --> 02:29:17.150]  buying something tell us you know and we'll take care of you it'll probably something official it'll
[02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:24.750]  probably only work at the pueblo location because uh jesse's not in denver yeah but um tell him
[02:29:24.750 --> 02:29:30.430]  anyways um and uh we'll get something worked out in denver nice you guys hear that we're gonna get
[02:29:30.430 --> 02:29:34.510]  a coupon code or some sort of deal for you guys for listening i'm also going to do some giveaways
[02:29:34.510 --> 02:29:40.430]  i just haven't decided how to do it uh i've got a couple of cool items possibly some titanium and
[02:29:40.430 --> 02:29:45.230]  possibly a t-shirt and maybe a couple of hat pins that need to be given away to listeners i just need
[02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:50.990]  good ideas on how to do it instagram and facebook giveaways feel cheesy if you give them to me i'll
[02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:56.750]  hand them out to anybody who talks not retarded at council i was gonna say i'll take one to sandy
[02:29:57.470 --> 02:30:01.630]  give her an irish genetics pin yep give me an irish shirts for all of them
[02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:07.150]  oh not even now you got me thinking they're both really anti-pop there was
[02:30:08.190 --> 02:30:14.990]  back on the subject of the proposed ordinance um they mentioned something about uh really or
[02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:21.630]  landlords in there and i kind of thought that was bs too um i know a couple local landlords uh one
[02:30:21.630 --> 02:30:27.470]  of them has over 30 properties and the other one has 18 properties and some of those are big
[02:30:27.470 --> 02:30:33.950]  duplexes or apartment buildings um they don't care they actually tell their tenants they don't care
[02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:41.230]  that um you know i'm sorry i can't name them but they don't care golden information in this state
[02:30:41.230 --> 02:30:45.550]  almost all of their tenants grow almost all of their tenants pay rent on time they take care of
[02:30:45.550 --> 02:30:52.590]  their houses uh they love them um they you know so i don't know where they came up with landlords
[02:30:52.590 --> 02:30:57.790]  are pissed about this but they it's because no one in the industry stands up if you're on city
[02:30:57.790 --> 02:31:05.390]  council or if you're the police chief or the fire chief you don't meet caregivers like you two you
[02:31:05.390 --> 02:31:11.230]  meet the caregiver who set his fucking house on fire you meet the caregiver who got to or got
[02:31:11.230 --> 02:31:17.310]  drunk at the bar and backed into the somebody's car with three pounds in the trunk and like the
[02:31:17.310 --> 02:31:22.110]  just blasted ash in the backyard right yeah somebody blew their garage apart open blasting
[02:31:22.110 --> 02:31:28.510]  and smoking a cigarette at the same time that's a good point um and because you guys are good at
[02:31:28.510 --> 02:31:34.670]  what you do and you've never blown yourself up or set your house on fire they've never met you
[02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:39.550]  they've never heard of you they've never seen pictures of your garden if i could take pictures
[02:31:39.550 --> 02:31:46.990]  of your grow room and take them to city council i could give them an idea of what looking or what
[02:31:46.990 --> 02:31:51.390]  doing it right looks like because they've only ever seen the one that the cops got called on
[02:31:51.390 --> 02:31:56.670]  and the cops took pictures of i mean that's part of the problem there unless you're reading high
[02:31:56.670 --> 02:32:03.390]  times or kush or which i'm sure they're blessed like i am and you get to make friends with people
[02:32:03.390 --> 02:32:10.590]  like jeff and jesse uh you never see this if you guys want pictures check out uh i read genetics
[02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:15.630]  on instagram also check out jesse grows on instagram lots of great pot pictures yes while
[02:32:15.630 --> 02:32:20.350]  you're at it download instagram while you're at it follow our friend garden of weedon on instagram
[02:32:20.350 --> 02:32:25.230]  if you want high high quality cannabis pictures if you like pot porn do what he just said yeah
[02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:31.550]  no porn there's a reason he uh just won a nice little uh secret cup there man it was good to
[02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:35.950]  look up uh i was dabbing i looked up and suddenly jesse was at the secret cup i had no idea you were
[02:32:35.950 --> 02:32:40.030]  coming i thought that was pretty sweet yeah it just blew up real quick and then i blinked
[02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:44.190]  and he was gone i was literally repotting plants i was like fuck it i'm gonna go
[02:32:46.430 --> 02:32:50.510]  it was about 45 minutes to get there i think your travel time was more than what you spent there
[02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:59.150]  yeah probably so yeah yeah but it uh best uh drive time ever you know it was so like exciting
[02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:04.670]  it was just so cool yeah once again big shout out to our buddy spence for uh taking home the first
[02:33:04.670 --> 02:33:09.550]  place at the secret cup mountain region i keep wishing him the best of luck in vegas but i'm
[02:33:09.550 --> 02:33:14.030]  pretty sure he's gonna bring it home for us oh yeah he put this little town on the map bro yeah
[02:33:14.030 --> 02:33:18.350]  and see i mean for something so positive too we're always on the map for some psychotically
[02:33:18.350 --> 02:33:24.110]  horrid shit yeah it's so nice when it's positive you know um another thing i was wanting to say
[02:33:24.270 --> 02:33:31.470]  most caregivers basements i've seen that's just a general term for where their girl is um most of
[02:33:31.470 --> 02:33:37.630]  them are way cleaner than most dispensaries uh girls i've seen that's just the honest truth
[02:33:38.590 --> 02:33:43.870]  nine days out of ten i'd be happy eating off jeff's growing floor i'm kind of i've got a
[02:33:43.870 --> 02:33:48.910]  little bit of ocd and that plays very well being a pot farmer it does it plays and you'll notice
[02:33:48.910 --> 02:33:53.390]  my front yard is clean my backyard is clean the sides of my house are clean i asked my neighbors
[02:33:53.390 --> 02:33:57.550]  neighbors to remove some debris they had over there they had a trailer with like old wood they
[02:33:57.550 --> 02:34:01.150]  had chopped down and they didn't take it away for a long time i was like i hate to be a stickler but
[02:34:01.150 --> 02:34:05.150]  could you possibly take away that wood and if you need some more reasons why i'll let you know why
[02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:09.230]  it's bugging me they're like i'm sorry we'll get rid of it and they took us it's bugs dude i don't
[02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:14.990]  need every little board uh my weeds are pulled all the time my garden my back backyard garden
[02:34:14.990 --> 02:34:19.310]  is clean uh because i can't afford the bugs that that will bring that will bring more problems and
[02:34:19.310 --> 02:34:23.230]  it also makes your house look like shit and being a pot grower i want to be a good citizen and not
[02:34:23.230 --> 02:34:29.710]  make my house look like shit i mean that's part of the thing no one sees this no one sees how well
[02:34:29.710 --> 02:34:34.910]  most of the industry does it they uh most of city council hasn't bothered to go out and visit any
[02:34:35.630 --> 02:34:40.110]  of the legal marijuana stores in town some of which have been open for like seven eight years
[02:34:40.110 --> 02:34:46.190]  now i mean how long has marisol been open and they can't make that drive i mean i'm it's not
[02:34:46.190 --> 02:34:50.030]  exactly the best example i could have thrown out but like it's been there the longest and that's
[02:34:50.030 --> 02:34:54.750]  the first dispensary we got in pueblo we got to give them credit it's the first and i mean you
[02:34:54.750 --> 02:34:58.990]  can't go out there and check if it's something that's so scary and should be fought like shouldn't
[02:34:58.990 --> 02:35:03.230]  you understand your opponent to kill it or at least some nonsense like that and go see it once
[02:35:03.230 --> 02:35:08.350]  some jedi shit right there bro but it's so scary if they see it from the parking lot they'll have
[02:35:08.350 --> 02:35:15.150]  to go in and inject some marijuanas watch out they're gonna turn gay guys if you're growing
[02:35:15.150 --> 02:35:22.750]  indoors walk into your grow room and close your eyes and breathe and if it smells like wet or
[02:35:22.750 --> 02:35:27.150]  smells like plants you're doing it wrong you need more ventilation you need more air out and more
[02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:30.990]  fresh air in you don't want to be able to smell that shit in your own grow room you shouldn't be
[02:35:30.990 --> 02:35:35.870]  able to smell it in there this random grow tip has been brought to you by our genetics i'm just
[02:35:35.870 --> 02:35:41.070]  thinking about filtration and if we're gonna grow indoors yeah i gotta order a couple carbon filters
[02:35:41.070 --> 02:35:44.510]  by the way if we're gonna be growing indoors and doing it right that's that's how you know you're
[02:35:44.510 --> 02:35:48.510]  not putting humidity and mildew problems into the house and that's how you know you're filtering it
[02:35:48.510 --> 02:35:52.990]  to where your neighbors aren't going to complain i blew a guy's mind the other day uh sold him an
[02:35:52.990 --> 02:35:58.750]  intake a carbon filter for the intake that's so sweet when i first told him about it he was like
[02:35:58.750 --> 02:36:04.990]  sounds like a waste of money and within 45 seconds he was like oh whoa oh wow yeah
[02:36:05.950 --> 02:36:11.630]  it's like dude even like it makes your light bulbs last longer i mean everything it's just
[02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:17.150]  it's better yeah yeah carbon filters guys uh carbon scrubbers if you're not using it to just
[02:36:17.150 --> 02:36:21.470]  uh pull the air out of the room that you're growing in put a filter with a blower in there
[02:36:21.470 --> 02:36:24.990]  just right in the middle of the room either on the floor or hanging in the ceiling to keep the air
[02:36:24.990 --> 02:36:29.790]  clean and keep air moving you can't have too much airflow in your grow room you really can't random
[02:36:29.790 --> 02:36:36.510]  tips from some pros today and we have really good air here too so had everyone in town taken that
[02:36:36.510 --> 02:36:43.390]  advice at the beginning of the summer we would not be here recording this episode i'm a really
[02:36:43.950 --> 02:36:48.990]  you know i'm an outdoor grower um it's hard to keep that stink away i don't have a good
[02:36:48.990 --> 02:36:55.470]  suggestion at the same time have you ever had a neighbor no but where where i i thought that was
[02:36:55.470 --> 02:37:02.030]  my question well no i've i've been in many back door or backyard gardens back jesus i'm just
[02:37:02.830 --> 02:37:07.470]  i've been in many backyard you got something weird on your mind that kind of and uh
[02:37:09.790 --> 02:37:15.310]  i haven't seen a lot of pissed off neighbors on either side generally because unless you're doing
[02:37:15.310 --> 02:37:25.150]  it in large quantities or you're really good at it you're not gonna produce a level of stink that's
[02:37:25.150 --> 02:37:31.950]  there for more than two weeks at any sort of obnoxious level i mean we're not talking more
[02:37:31.950 --> 02:37:36.030]  than like the dog shit from the guy next door who hasn't raked it up in a couple of weeks or the
[02:37:36.030 --> 02:37:43.150]  compost pile that's baking in the sun type odor here it's not that strong it's just peculiar
[02:37:44.670 --> 02:37:49.630]  and unless you're a real dick your neighbor's not gonna call the cops and every member of
[02:37:49.630 --> 02:37:55.630]  city council instead of you they're also they're also those people that claim just the smell of pot
[02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:59.790]  makes me sick i get a headache and i think that's bullshit because i've smelled some all kinds of
[02:37:59.790 --> 02:38:04.270]  shit and no smells have ever really given me a headache uh just smelling something probably
[02:38:04.270 --> 02:38:10.030]  that's but there are some people that love to cling to a problem or a well right now there's
[02:38:10.030 --> 02:38:15.470]  a lot of people looking for anything about marijuana to gripe about which we're seeing
[02:38:15.470 --> 02:38:20.110]  a lot of that on pueblo west right now and these folks that are sneaking out their neighbors are
[02:38:20.110 --> 02:38:25.390]  really you're hurting the cause man we we succeeded and we got full legalization and
[02:38:25.390 --> 02:38:30.110]  now we've got people looking to throw anchors at us and it sucks good job on the stink but man
[02:38:30.110 --> 02:38:35.150]  turn it down my aunt lives in pueblo west every sunday we go out there and eat dinner with them
[02:38:35.710 --> 02:38:41.950]  um i grew up out there so or well i went to high school out there um i drive around and stuff like
[02:38:41.950 --> 02:38:47.710]  that uh take different roads every single time i can find two or three plants sticking above the
[02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:55.470]  fence uh there's a place out there uh his hoop houses he have in his backyard kind of remind me
[02:38:55.470 --> 02:39:03.390]  of what greener side looks like you know i mean they're they're they're pushing it they're pushing
[02:39:03.390 --> 02:39:09.310]  the limits they're being assholes um and that sucks i thought about going to the mountains
[02:39:09.390 --> 02:39:13.310]  thought about doing some plants in my backyard i was going to buy one of those 10x10 dog runs
[02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:18.990]  and a little greenhouse and put the greenhouse inside the dog run but uh like seven out of 10
[02:39:18.990 --> 02:39:22.990]  growers that have grown some outdoor pot this year have either had caterpillars or thieves in this
[02:39:22.990 --> 02:39:28.350]  neighborhood and i'm just gonna pass on the outdoor one of the things most people don't
[02:39:28.350 --> 02:39:33.790]  take into account for the outdoor is you're giving up like 90 percent of your control
[02:39:34.270 --> 02:39:40.270]  so that you can also give up 90 percent of your energy cost and 99 percent of your control yeah
[02:39:40.270 --> 02:39:47.390]  95 yeah yeah you would be much more qualified to speak on this and environmentally yeah weather
[02:39:47.390 --> 02:39:52.190]  and bugs you can do weather and bugs are gonna kick your ass all summer long i mean i just grew
[02:39:52.190 --> 02:39:56.750]  a bunch of veggies outdoor this year and the weather and the bugs pretty much killed me but
[02:39:56.750 --> 02:40:01.310]  i still got a massive harvest that you use old pot dirt to grow veggies i know a bunch of growers
[02:40:01.310 --> 02:40:06.990]  that gave me two truckfuls of old pot dirt mix it with sand so it holds water a little better i
[02:40:06.990 --> 02:40:12.830]  mixed it with that clay crap pueblo was built on yeah it worked like a charm folks i got zucchinis
[02:40:12.830 --> 02:40:18.030]  the size of jeff he brought me some uh some jalapenos some tomatoes i got a nice bag of
[02:40:18.030 --> 02:40:22.350]  produce one night that was pretty nice yeah it's nice being the hippie kid in the in the group
[02:40:22.350 --> 02:40:26.590]  because all my farmer friends jesse was bringing me killer tomatoes i can't even eat a damn tomato
[02:40:27.310 --> 02:40:31.310]  anyway now after eating the stuff that he gave me my cherry tomatoes are just blooming
[02:40:32.270 --> 02:40:41.950]  my uh shit fucking it uh um it totally uh got a second leg her second wind yeah that's crazy
[02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:48.670]  i rarely eat eggs because uh it's kind of a dietary decision but also because eggs are disgusting
[02:40:49.230 --> 02:40:54.030]  uh but then jesse brought me a few eggs and i was like let's give it a try and i cracked them open
[02:40:54.030 --> 02:40:59.870]  and the yolk on the inside it looked healthy they smelled good uh and those eggs were tasty
[02:40:59.870 --> 02:41:03.950]  i fried them up and made some my egg and i forgot what i even did but those were so good
[02:41:04.750 --> 02:41:11.230]  not store-bought processed gmo shit uh those real eggs and that real vegetables you brought me so

[02:43:14.910 --> 02:43:20.590]  before you can fully pull a video of me berating city council for dragging their feet online
[02:43:21.230 --> 02:43:28.030]  nice um if we had like 80 people show up do you think they would ever bring up a pot ordinance
[02:43:28.430 --> 02:43:36.350]  if we had 80 people show up they would do whatever we asked if we had five people show up
[02:43:36.350 --> 02:43:42.190]  this ordinance would never see the light of day the public meeting that we're asking you to attend
[02:43:42.190 --> 02:43:47.230]  is on the 13th it's officially being the ordinance is officially being presented to city council on
[02:43:47.230 --> 02:43:54.190]  the 15th if half a dozen of us show up on the 13th and three or four of us stand up and speak and say
[02:43:54.190 --> 02:43:59.390]  we think this is a terrible ordinance it's unenforceable it's really bad for pueblo there's
[02:43:59.390 --> 02:44:06.590]  no point don't do it and we're not psychotic about it when they present it on the 15th it'll get
[02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:11.950]  killed immediately and it will never make it onto the official agenda it will never be voted on by
[02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:19.550]  city council it'll die quickly if 30 or 40 of us show up we'll have the city overlay for the retail
[02:44:19.550 --> 02:44:24.910]  stores shaken out of this planning and zoning commission months earlier than we would otherwise
[02:44:25.710 --> 02:44:31.710]  right now no one shows up no one stands up no one's called city council to bitch about not
[02:44:31.710 --> 02:44:35.710]  seeing this yet and so they're dragging their feet and we're not going to see it till after

[02:46:24.350 --> 02:46:29.470]  that on twitter too i'm still learning it so i'm new to twitter oh i'm a twitter monster i am a
[02:46:29.470 --> 02:46:34.510]  twitter monster um i usually end the show and then uh come back and wrap it up but i'm just going to
[02:46:34.510 --> 02:46:39.550]  do it now because uh we've got it going on guys i want to ask my my listeners for one thing i need
[02:46:39.550 --> 02:46:44.430]  a theme song um i've been playing other artists songs and i've been playing that one reggae song
[02:46:44.430 --> 02:46:49.230]  you hear is a theme that i made on itunes it's not acceptable or on garage band sorry that's not
[02:46:49.230 --> 02:46:56.270]  acceptable if somebody would make me a super cool theme about two minutes long maybe uh say a few
[02:46:56.270 --> 02:47:01.870]  key phrases i grow culture podcast hosted by rasta jeff brought to you by irie genetics you know
[02:47:02.510 --> 02:47:06.510]  uh i would make it up to you in some sort of way depending on what state you live in and how old you
[02:47:06.510 --> 02:47:10.270]  are we could work on a little compensation but there would definitely be some pay in there i'm
[02:47:10.270 --> 02:47:14.910]  not begging i just need a theme song i'm tired of listening to that cheesy reggae tune i made and
[02:47:14.910 --> 02:47:19.790]  i've been putting the show on you on youtube and youtube gets mad at me for using all those other
[02:47:19.790 --> 02:47:23.950]  people's songs i've got their written permission all the artists that i use i've got permission
[02:47:23.950 --> 02:47:27.870]  proving that to google's tricky exactly they don't even care if you do prove it they're like that
[02:47:27.870 --> 02:47:32.270]  email doesn't mean shit to us we need a written letter from a record label with notary and yeah
[02:47:32.270 --> 02:47:37.150]  sorry dude have bono call us yeah that's the artists i'm using are actually my friends it's
[02:47:37.150 --> 02:47:40.670]  like mystic roots and task rock and i've been like hey can i use your music i'm like yeah of course
[02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:45.390]  bro so there's like you know they've said yes but that's as far as we've gotten yeah you can't play
[02:47:45.390 --> 02:47:49.870]  google that voicemail that's right so somebody if you want to write i like reggae obviously if you
[02:47:49.870 --> 02:47:53.550]  wanted to write a couple of them that'd be badass maybe one for the start of the show one for the
[02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:58.830]  end of the show maybe a short piece for like between segments uh something with a real aggressive
[02:47:58.830 --> 02:48:02.750]  dance hall reggae beat would be pretty smooth i don't know i'm just begging at this point i could
[02:48:02.750 --> 02:48:07.950]  use a theme song that's what i'm trying to get at he also likes death metal like so you know he's a
[02:48:07.950 --> 02:48:12.350]  big slayer fan so anything with there's nothing like getting real high and just listening to a
[02:48:12.350 --> 02:48:19.870]  thousand beats per minute in your head right please don't do that don't don't waste your
[02:48:19.870 --> 02:48:22.830]  energy we'll play it when jesse comes on we're like and jesse
[02:48:23.790 --> 02:48:28.510]  i don't even like that yeah i'll see we're don't do that don't do that i like reggae i like some
[02:48:28.510 --> 02:48:33.150]  funky shit i'm a huge fish grateful dead kind of guy so you know agriculture podcast needs a
[02:48:33.150 --> 02:48:37.390]  theme song and you'll be compensated in some way or another if you're in colorado i'll get high with
[02:48:37.390 --> 02:48:41.390]  you i'll definitely hook you up with some seeds if you're in colorado i just have to make sure
[02:48:41.390 --> 02:48:45.870]  you're 21 and in colorado i can't do that if you're outside of colorado if you come to colorado
[02:48:45.870 --> 02:48:49.950]  i'll get you seeds i got you and one of my favorite things to wear around town is my iry
[02:48:49.950 --> 02:48:53.550]  pin and you can wear the fuck out of that in pennsylvania or new york or any other state that
[02:48:53.550 --> 02:48:57.470]  sucks out loud and you could also probably get an iry genetics t-shirt if i have your size and
[02:48:57.470 --> 02:49:01.870]  some stickers and a pan we'll make it worth it trust me right there's other stuff too i've got

[02:56:42.740 --> 02:56:48.260]  you'll remember that around episode 30 i said that i would uh start paying a dollar every time i say
[02:56:48.260 --> 02:56:53.380]  the f-word because i'm trying to not say the f-word on the podcast i need somebody to go back
[02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:59.220]  and listen from episode 30 to 34 and let me know how many dollars i owe there's a sick child in need
[02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:04.020]  and i had a conversation with one of his parents i think it was his uncle and i said that i would

[02:59:07.780 --> 02:59:13.300]  nice episode the people have been asking for the dry and cure episode i think they will be proud
[02:59:13.300 --> 02:59:19.060]  of what we bring them today awesome jesse actually said that he could use a little uh what is it a
[02:59:19.060 --> 02:59:24.260]  primer lesson is that what it's called on how to how to cure some herbs i've never uh never been
[02:59:24.260 --> 02:59:31.460]  real happy with any of my cure jobs so i mean i've been told they're great but um um you know
[02:59:31.460 --> 02:59:37.780]  this i always i feel like i have a lot of room for improvement there your standards on your own
[02:59:37.780 --> 02:59:41.700]  product are always higher than everybody else's your own expectations you know what i mean i'm
[02:59:41.700 --> 02:59:46.820]  never satisfied with my my herb or anything and everyone's like that was amazing yeah especially
[02:59:46.820 --> 02:59:50.580]  when i play music i'm like that could have been better and they're like no dude you nailed it
[02:59:51.860 --> 02:59:55.380]  i was sloppy i can feel the same thing snowboarding as well
[02:59:56.900 --> 03:00:00.180]  me on a snowboard it's like trying to put a telephone pole on a snowboard
[03:00:00.180 --> 03:00:05.860]  it's just a lot of me rolling down my face oh man i thought you snowboarded actually i
[03:00:05.860 --> 03:00:10.420]  i do but i spend more time on the lift and on my ass than i do on the actual board
[03:00:10.980 --> 03:00:13.860]  i can't do it anymore the left knee disagrees with the snowboard now
[03:00:14.740 --> 03:00:18.500]  it feels like uh it feels like my left knee wants to fly out of the socket the entire time i'm
[03:00:18.500 --> 03:00:24.740]  strapped in i can't ski for a similar reason okay they told me to move to skis they said it wouldn't
[03:00:24.740 --> 03:00:29.460]  hurt as bad if i skied possibly maybe i'll try that this winter case to case my snowboard friends
[03:00:29.460 --> 03:00:34.260]  have moved away miss you guys hope you're listening so uh we're here to talk about curing herb not
[03:00:34.260 --> 03:00:38.020]  talking about curing ourselves actually i guess curing herb will cure ourselves i'm talking into
[03:00:38.020 --> 03:00:43.300]  a circle because i'm really dabbed out really dabbed out really yeah we uh we're setting a new
[03:00:43.300 --> 03:00:47.460]  record for we burned out the email i think and had to switch over to the regular rig
[03:00:48.020 --> 03:00:51.140]  the email couldn't keep up with the puddles we were putting on it and i think it took a
[03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:55.700]  shit today so hey giddy up uh remember what you're telling me uh shout out to giddy up i ran into
[03:00:55.700 --> 03:01:00.260]  giddy on chat roulette that was amazing and you said something about sending me a g-nail homie
[03:01:00.260 --> 03:01:05.140]  so don't forget because my nail just took a shit so that'd be great timing um we want to cure some
[03:01:05.300 --> 03:01:08.980]  that's why everybody's listening you're doing good bro by the way i just kind of skipped right over
[03:01:08.980 --> 03:01:12.100]  introducing you for sure you're having a good day you looked like you were working hard kind of busy
[03:01:12.100 --> 03:01:16.980]  very very hard let's take some dabs take a break we'll record it'll be awesome so if you're going
[03:01:16.980 --> 03:01:22.820]  to cure some weed um you're going to need a few things you should have a dehumidifier maybe you
[03:01:22.820 --> 03:01:28.820]  should have an air conditioner maybe you for sure need fans at least one fan you need what i call a
[03:01:28.820 --> 03:01:34.660]  hygrometer that's a uh it's a thermometer with a humidity reading on it also then you're going
[03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:39.780]  to need some kind of jars i prefer glass mason jars if you're going a little bigger there's a
[03:01:39.780 --> 03:01:44.020]  company i think it's called quick vac they're a little suction vac lid jars they sell them at most
[03:01:44.020 --> 03:01:47.060]  of the head shops those are pretty chill to cure your weed and a lot of people don't like them
[03:01:47.060 --> 03:01:52.260]  because those are plastic i don't think they leave any taste or smell those don't uh if you're going
[03:01:52.260 --> 03:01:57.700]  bigger i like to buy those rubbermaid uh 32 quart containers i think that's what it is it's a big
[03:01:57.700 --> 03:02:03.060]  container uh it's like a two-handed container uh you can fit a lot of herb in one of those to cure
[03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:07.860]  it those work perfectly so you're going to need something to cure it in and a room uh to get it
[03:02:08.500 --> 03:02:15.860]  started to cure it ed rosenthal actually taught me that curing begins at the start of harvest
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:22.580]  um i'm not sure how much i subscribe to ed's teaching but in a sense that is accurate the
[03:02:22.580 --> 03:02:26.500]  minute you cut down that plant you're starting the curing process you need that herb to dry
[03:02:27.300 --> 03:02:33.540]  uniformly uh not too fast not too slow and you don't want it in a hot room you don't want it in
[03:02:33.540 --> 03:02:39.220]  a cool room so we're going to kind of go from and one of our lessons before we talked from where we
[03:02:39.220 --> 03:02:45.060]  talked about harvest and drying and we ended drying as when where the sticks on your buds snap that's
[03:02:45.060 --> 03:02:49.540]  pretty much where we decided we were entering cure so if you've done everything right you've
[03:02:49.540 --> 03:02:54.900]  got all your leaves off uh your buds have dried evenly in a nice room that was temperature
[03:02:54.900 --> 03:02:59.700]  controlled not too fast not too cool and now the sticks are snapping and the buds are a little bit
[03:02:59.700 --> 03:03:04.260]  damp a little bit juicy if you squeeze them uh they kind of stick to your fingers but they kind
[03:03:04.260 --> 03:03:08.980]  of spring back to life they don't you don't crush them when you squeeze them you want them to have
[03:03:08.980 --> 03:03:14.820]  a little spring left into it for sure all right so i guess i should read and don't be deceived by
[03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:21.300]  the crunchy layer some i guess it goes strain to strain but sometimes there's a lot more leaf on
[03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:28.100]  the outside oh yeah you know that's the way you could get tricked either way you know for sure
[03:03:28.660 --> 03:03:35.860]  by letting it over dry and uh also by thinking it's dry too soon so right um the weed dries from
[03:03:35.860 --> 03:03:41.220]  the outside or from the outside end so even though the outside leaves are crispy and dry the inside
[03:03:41.220 --> 03:03:48.020]  could be really juicy still so you got to be careful little buds are uh gonna dry quicker
[03:03:48.020 --> 03:03:53.140]  than the big buds right i feel that's uh i like to cut when i grow a big bud i actually cut that
[03:03:53.140 --> 03:03:57.460]  all down into the little uh little golf ball sized nuggets if you if you're one of my patients
[03:03:57.460 --> 03:04:02.100]  you usually get a bag full of golf balls is what i give you i do when uh when i'm doing like the
[03:04:02.100 --> 03:04:08.260]  final trim okay sometimes when they're hanging you know the bigger buds are a little harder
[03:04:08.260 --> 03:04:14.180]  to break down sometimes so um nothing to do with them yeah you don't want to put them on a rack
[03:04:15.060 --> 03:04:19.220]  okay well right before we're before we're gonna cure this is when the sticks will pop so everything's
[03:04:19.220 --> 03:04:23.300]  all trimmed up now we don't have any leaves left uh they look pretty they're manicured the way you
[03:04:23.300 --> 03:04:27.620]  want uh when you grab one of the buds you pick it up and you bend the stick it should snap you don't
[03:04:27.620 --> 03:04:31.860]  want it to bend like a straw you want it to actually break pop you don't want to leave it until
[03:04:31.860 --> 03:04:37.940]  it like explodes and breaks because then you're a little too dry um too dry or too wet of cannabis
[03:04:37.940 --> 03:04:42.500]  will not cure properly if you're too dry you've already missed your point uh you're gonna get
[03:04:42.500 --> 03:04:46.260]  stale buds you're just gonna put it in the jar and waste time if you're too wet and you try to
[03:04:46.260 --> 03:04:52.100]  cure it you're actually going to promote mold so you want it about right where those sticks snap
[03:04:52.100 --> 03:04:57.300]  and that's when you're going to start the curing process um let me read you what i wrote of what
[03:04:57.300 --> 03:05:02.500]  curing actually is and what the pur the purpose of curing is this is what i just what i wrote down to
[03:05:02.500 --> 03:05:08.660]  give an actual reason curing is used to remove excess moisture to convert complex to convert
[03:05:08.740 --> 03:05:14.260]  complex carbs back into sugars while removing chlorophyll chlorophyll is green pigment and
[03:05:14.260 --> 03:05:19.060]  chlorophyll makes your buds taste harsh and smell bad and it also makes your buds burn partly
[03:05:19.060 --> 03:05:23.380]  have you guys ever smoked herb that kind of maybe tastes like you just stuck your tongue in a light
[03:05:23.380 --> 03:05:28.260]  socket you just want to scrape your tongue off or you need a drink real bad that stuff was not
[03:05:28.260 --> 03:05:36.340]  dried and cured properly probably not flushed properly either uh also as thc dries the thc
[03:05:36.340 --> 03:05:41.620]  dries in your buds if it dries more slowly uh the more slower it loses its water moisture the
[03:05:41.620 --> 03:05:46.980]  more psychoactive it will become once the water comes out of that thc that's when it's ripe and
[03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:51.860]  nice and primed for you to smoke so by curing it you slowly let that happen and you don't destroy
[03:05:51.860 --> 03:05:59.060]  the thc you don't destroy your terpenes um essentially curing allows aerobic bacteria
[03:05:59.060 --> 03:06:02.260]  to consume the chlorophyll in the plants chlorophyll is what we want to remove
[03:06:02.980 --> 03:06:07.300]  um aerobic bacteria sounds like a bad thing it's actually a good thing in this instance
[03:06:07.300 --> 03:06:13.300]  um aerobic bacteria is made from air light and moisture being sealed inside of that jar
[03:06:13.940 --> 03:06:21.380]  so what i do i actually take my buds that snap i fill my mason jar about 90 of the way full i don't
[03:06:21.380 --> 03:06:25.060]  want to squish them in there i just want to lightly set them in there then i seal that jar
[03:06:25.940 --> 03:06:31.700]  um as soon as that jar is sealed the aerobic bacteria begins to form and that aerobic
[03:06:31.700 --> 03:06:38.980]  bacteria will start eating away the chlorophyll in there um so when you open that jar that's when
[03:06:38.980 --> 03:06:46.100]  the reaction will restart so what you want to do what i do is i put the buds in the jar i seal it
[03:06:46.100 --> 03:06:52.020]  up and then i wait about two hours and then i go open the jar and that first time i'll pour the
[03:06:52.020 --> 03:06:56.020]  buds out onto my little tray and i want to feel the buds and make sure they're not they haven't
[03:06:56.020 --> 03:07:01.060]  gotten really moist or they haven't if you can see sweat inside the jar get them out of there
[03:07:01.060 --> 03:07:06.260]  immediately you've fucked up get them out of there right away uh once so i take them out of the jar
[03:07:06.260 --> 03:07:10.020]  and i start squeezing them and i want to feel a little bit of moisture at the edge because it's
[03:07:10.020 --> 03:07:14.580]  coming out of the middle on the surface but i don't want them to be damp and sticky or i'm afraid
[03:07:14.580 --> 03:07:18.900]  they're going to get mold so i'll leave them out this first time i dump them out and check them
[03:07:18.900 --> 03:07:22.180]  all out i leave them sitting out for a couple minutes if i feel like they need it then i'll put
[03:07:22.180 --> 03:07:27.940]  them back in the jar and seal that jar up if they're uh properly dry like i'm hoping they are
[03:07:27.940 --> 03:07:32.660]  at this point i'll leave it closed for four hours this time and i know this sounds tedious but this
[03:07:32.660 --> 03:07:36.580]  is where this is what separates the the pros from the regular growers this is where you get that
[03:07:36.580 --> 03:07:41.300]  super high grade cured cannabis uh that stuff you're getting at the dispensary that tastes
[03:07:41.300 --> 03:07:46.740]  kind of hay-like and i don't mean to call out the shops but they don't have time or space or manpower
[03:07:46.740 --> 03:07:51.940]  or the patience to cure herb uh your caregiver or your private grower or you are the only way
[03:07:51.940 --> 03:07:56.820]  you're gonna get good cured herb the dispensary is not gonna do it it tastes you can taste the
[03:07:56.820 --> 03:08:01.300]  nutrients you can taste the leaves you can taste whatever other plant it was growing next to or
[03:08:01.300 --> 03:08:06.020]  hanging next to in the dry room you can taste that in these dispensary buds in my opinion there are
[03:08:06.020 --> 03:08:11.860]  very few shops that are actually curing their herb in my opinion i don't work there so i can't tell
[03:08:11.860 --> 03:08:15.940]  you what they're doing i thought you were gonna say there's very very few shops flushing their
[03:08:15.940 --> 03:08:21.940]  stuff that too that too it's curing it wow you're gonna have to let me know when we that's that's
[03:08:21.940 --> 03:08:27.380]  where we'll we'll go there and get some herbal in a day so where i was so you got to put your
[03:08:27.380 --> 03:08:31.380]  put your buds back in the jar you seal the jar you wait four hours uh that's when i open it again
[03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:36.980]  and then i want to check the buds and make sure that they're not getting uh too much moisture is
[03:08:36.980 --> 03:08:40.980]  not coming out of there if i feel like it's really humid inside of the jar i said humid
[03:08:41.300 --> 03:08:47.380]  if it's not too humid inside of the jar i'll put them back in there seal it up and let them sit for
[03:08:47.380 --> 03:08:52.420]  like six hours um i pretty much increase the time just by a couple hours until i get to about 12
[03:08:52.420 --> 03:08:58.420]  hours and then once you're checking them twice a day so i'll do six hours and then i'll do like
[03:08:58.420 --> 03:09:02.100]  10 hours and then i'll wait till about 12 hours and then i'll usually open them like
[03:09:02.100 --> 03:09:06.420]  every morning when i wake up and then right before i go to bed that's about 12 hours usually in my
[03:09:06.420 --> 03:09:10.260]  world so you pop open the jar make sure it's not too moist let it sit open for just like
[03:09:10.260 --> 03:09:15.140]  10 or 15 minutes you just want to exchange the air and then seal it back up and let it sit there
[03:09:16.020 --> 03:09:20.180]  once you've got it to a point where you know it's not going to get any mold in it
[03:09:20.820 --> 03:09:24.020]  that's when i like to just seal it up and leave it i won't open it anymore
[03:09:25.700 --> 03:09:31.140]  go ahead it'll it should burn really nicely at this point correct it should burn nice and smooth
[03:09:32.980 --> 03:09:37.860]  and you can tell um i don't know if you guys have ever had perfectly cured or if it's hard
[03:09:37.860 --> 03:09:43.140]  to get honestly very but it there's you know that herb you can smell down the block you're going oh
[03:09:43.140 --> 03:09:49.220]  man that stuff was slowly dried and cured it let all of the chlorophyll sneak out and it let all
[03:09:49.220 --> 03:09:53.780]  of the flavor that should have been there when the chlorophyll disappears that's when the other
[03:09:53.780 --> 03:09:57.620]  colors the reds and the purples start popping up and you can start seeing those and that's what
[03:09:57.620 --> 03:10:03.300]  gives you really pretty buds and that's when the thc is allowed to dry slowly and that's when it
[03:10:03.300 --> 03:10:08.900]  becomes more psychoactive i'm not completely sure about the terpenoids but it sounds like we need to
[03:10:08.900 --> 03:10:13.380]  give these terpenoids a little bit of time to cure and they're also so they're not getting destroyed
[03:10:13.380 --> 03:10:17.940]  or taken out along with the chlorophyll or with the moisture if we let it go slowly i think we're
[03:10:17.940 --> 03:10:22.500]  making it smell better because we're doing something to the terps and from what i know
[03:10:22.500 --> 03:10:29.460]  about them they seem very fragile too so this is you know mild or moderate temperatures and darkness
[03:10:29.460 --> 03:10:36.420]  i think are all very key to this i think i read that terpenoids uh evaporate at approximately 85
[03:10:36.420 --> 03:10:43.300]  degrees um we read on another on another episode about 106 degrees was i think where we said
[03:10:43.300 --> 03:10:47.460]  so i think it's right around 100 degrees and some of your guys's drying and curing
[03:10:47.460 --> 03:10:49.940]  rooms are getting that hot excuse me i need a sip
[03:10:53.060 --> 03:10:57.460]  nice all those dabs got me all dried out thirsty dude we took some monster dabs before the show
[03:10:57.460 --> 03:11:05.220]  that was pretty killer uh so you need to keep opening those jars until you're confident that
[03:11:05.220 --> 03:11:11.300]  it's not going to mold up in there you want a little bit of moisture kyle cushman prefers a bud
[03:11:11.300 --> 03:11:15.300]  he likes to open his jar and take out a couple of nugs and set them on the table and he would
[03:11:15.300 --> 03:11:18.580]  have sat here and talked for 20 minutes before he would have been able to roll them up he would
[03:11:18.580 --> 03:11:24.260]  have had to give you a lecture about veganics and then after that the bud would be almost dry enough
[03:11:24.260 --> 03:11:30.500]  to roll up sorry kyle i'm just picking on you bro you're great but so kyle likes his buds a little
[03:11:30.500 --> 03:11:35.620]  more moist our buddy adam will take a nicely dried and cured bud that i've given him and he'll set
[03:11:35.620 --> 03:11:40.100]  that shit out all day until it's crispy dry and then he grinds it up in the grinder to where it's
[03:11:40.100 --> 03:11:44.900]  dust and takes heroic size bong hits out of it because that's what he likes to do
[03:11:46.580 --> 03:11:52.100]  but the what you want to do is i like to get it to where it's it's not fluffy but it's it's got
[03:11:52.100 --> 03:11:55.780]  some squishy to it so if you've got a nice hard dense nug you want to be able to give it a squeeze
[03:11:55.780 --> 03:12:00.340]  and it just pops back up you don't want to crush it and you don't want dust you definitely don't
[03:12:00.340 --> 03:12:07.060]  i don't want that dry dusty buds no god no um how long do you try to store your cannabis
[03:12:08.420 --> 03:12:14.900]  um some of it gets stored for up to nine months i suppose you know some of the outdoor stuff
[03:12:15.460 --> 03:12:22.020]  um some of my patients i can give them their whole year supply at once and they're fine with it
[03:12:22.660 --> 03:12:29.140]  some of my other patients ask me to hold on to it for them so um and then you know some of them
[03:12:29.140 --> 03:12:35.540]  want indoor bud throughout the year so you know it's all a balance but yeah okay um the last
[03:12:35.540 --> 03:12:40.900]  couple years my stuff that's gotten nine ten months i just i really wasn't happy with it
[03:12:41.380 --> 03:12:46.660]  um by the time it was that age let's uh let's work on curing a little better and i bet that
[03:12:46.660 --> 03:12:53.060]  those buds will store longer i think i messed up in the beginning um i do pretty much you what you
[03:12:53.060 --> 03:13:00.180]  do for the the two hour pull it out of the jar and the four hour but then it normally it'll go 24
[03:13:00.180 --> 03:13:06.020]  hours 18 hours before i mess with it again you gotta set some alarms i've got my iphone full
[03:13:06.020 --> 03:13:11.380]  of alarms just ridiculous beeps people think i'm doing something crazy because every two hours i
[03:13:11.380 --> 03:13:15.540]  gotta run away i'll be back dude and gotta go somewhere and go pop open a bunch of jars and
[03:13:15.540 --> 03:13:19.620]  then go back and get them for sure if you're using larger batches i guess i should have covered this
[03:13:20.340 --> 03:13:24.820]  what i like to do is get one of those big uh they're like purple tupperware containers
[03:13:24.820 --> 03:13:29.620]  rubber made containers uh fill that up with your you can leave it on the sticks a little bit
[03:13:29.620 --> 03:13:33.300]  if you have to it's easier i prefer it off the stick for this curing process
[03:13:34.020 --> 03:13:38.900]  fill those containers and then i actually flip them upside down and take the container off the
[03:13:38.900 --> 03:13:44.260]  lid instead of taking the lid off the container so you leave a more exposed area and then just
[03:13:44.260 --> 03:13:48.340]  pop that container back onto the lid try not to squish any buds i hope that makes sense pop it
[03:13:48.340 --> 03:13:52.740]  open lift the container off the lid sitting there like a tray full of buds for sure yeah and that
[03:13:52.740 --> 03:13:58.180]  gets a lot of airflow in there yeah i like to use those uh actually the same ones or same
[03:13:58.180 --> 03:14:05.380]  same year size uh but they're like the size of a brownie pan yeah and that's those work for a
[03:14:05.380 --> 03:14:09.940]  short-term storage pretty good okay in the beginning i talked about we should have a
[03:14:09.940 --> 03:14:15.540]  dehumidifier an ac unit fans a hygrometer i'm gonna back up and talk a little bit about how
[03:14:15.540 --> 03:14:21.940]  ed rosenthal says curing starts at harvest wait hold on i got one thing uh let's do it i like it
[03:14:22.660 --> 03:14:30.740]  how you pack your jar um yeah i don't like to overpack it this is something i um
[03:14:31.860 --> 03:14:39.060]  am learning but i think there's a lot of validity to it you uh i think when you overpack it you
[03:14:39.060 --> 03:14:45.940]  create you know possible different little microclimates in there uh you almost prevent
[03:14:45.940 --> 03:14:50.260]  the aerobic acid from being able to form in there when you don't have enough oxygen for sure what
[03:14:50.260 --> 03:14:55.620]  creates aerobic acid i think i said before was oxygen light and moisture and so we need plenty
[03:14:55.620 --> 03:15:00.420]  of that air in there nice and don't worry about giving it light you guys a little bit of light
[03:15:00.420 --> 03:15:05.460]  will start it off and once you get it started it's going i'm fixing the echoes in here we are in a
[03:15:05.460 --> 03:15:09.380]  really small space that's real echoey today there's a fan that we're fighting with but i'm
[03:15:09.380 --> 03:15:16.340]  gonna make it happen i think i got it just there sweet all right so like i said ed rosenthal says
[03:15:16.340 --> 03:15:21.940]  that curing starts from pretty much when you cut it down so if your buds have gotten too dry they're
[03:15:21.940 --> 03:15:26.500]  not going to cure they're going to crumble if your buds are too moist you still have a chance but
[03:15:26.500 --> 03:15:31.780]  hopefully they didn't dry too quickly uh you got to cut down the plant and get all those leaves off
[03:15:31.780 --> 03:15:36.100]  and let it dry nice and slowly that's why we're talking about a room with a dehumidifier with an
[03:15:36.100 --> 03:15:43.140]  air conditioner and some fans and a hygrometer you want to keep your plants between 60 and 75 degrees
[03:15:43.140 --> 03:15:48.820]  at about 50 percent humidity until you put them in this jar until they reach that stick snap in
[03:15:48.820 --> 03:15:54.900]  period yeah that's how you keep them from not drying too fast i had a guy that uh a long time
[03:15:54.900 --> 03:16:00.980]  ago i used to have to buy some herb and this guy usually had the greatest bud a long time ago
[03:16:02.500 --> 03:16:05.620]  and i was bugging him i was like dude you got any more of that la confidential and do you have any
[03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:09.940]  more of that la confidential and he didn't and he kept telling me i harvested it it's almost ready i
[03:16:09.940 --> 03:16:14.500]  harvested it's almost ready and i was getting eager and so i asked him and he's like sure man
[03:16:14.500 --> 03:16:19.780]  i'll bring it to you tonight and he brought it to me and it was it was a really weird texture it
[03:16:19.780 --> 03:16:25.620]  felt like a pine cone uh it was hard but it was also squeezy but the outside was really hard and
[03:16:25.620 --> 03:16:30.420]  then he broke it open and the middle was soft and it was kind of fluffy on the inside so i immediately
[03:16:30.420 --> 03:16:35.540]  called him i was like what the hell happened bro and he said that he dried it by opening the oven
[03:16:35.540 --> 03:16:40.900]  and setting it next to the oven so that it would dry it out all night oh shit yeah so that is a
[03:16:40.900 --> 03:16:46.820]  prime example of what not to do to dry your herb i could taste it and smell it i made the weed smell
[03:16:46.820 --> 03:16:51.700]  like spaghetti sauce like it smelled like marinara for some reason that was the first thing that came
[03:16:51.700 --> 03:16:57.140]  to mind yeah it's gonna kill all the turps yeah yeah yeah some sort of tomatoey paste or something
[03:16:57.140 --> 03:17:02.580]  it was terrible that sucks so you got to get that herb dried properly and slowly you don't want to
[03:17:02.580 --> 03:17:07.140]  dry it up too fast you got anything to add to curing bro i feel like we went over that really
[03:17:07.140 --> 03:17:13.460]  super quickly yeah um just really stoned it's uh me too me too hard to project a lot of my thoughts
[03:17:14.980 --> 03:17:23.700]  do you need crayons um so the dehumidifier the ac unit the fans uh the hygrometer you need that
[03:17:23.700 --> 03:17:28.740]  regardless of where you're at um yeah you got to keep you need a proper room for drying a lot of
[03:17:28.740 --> 03:17:33.380]  guys are just throwing it in their closet or something you need a good area for drying uh you
[03:17:33.380 --> 03:17:38.260]  want to keep the air moving the reason for the dehumidifier what we're trying to do is we are
[03:17:38.260 --> 03:17:42.420]  pulling water out of these plants that water ends up in the atmosphere around your plants and then
[03:17:42.420 --> 03:17:46.980]  it has nowhere to go so you got to suck that water out of there the dehumidifier is a perfect place
[03:17:46.980 --> 03:17:51.780]  for that water to go and you can reuse that water to water your plants later oh yeah that's some
[03:17:51.780 --> 03:18:00.180]  good water yeah however um i do know if you're if say you're drying uh not a lot of plants in a
[03:18:00.180 --> 03:18:08.580]  large room in the southwest um you might actually want a humidifier to help slow things down right
[03:18:08.580 --> 03:18:13.060]  i'm trying to you know kind of help out people regionally yeah that's a good idea we're kind of
[03:18:13.060 --> 03:18:18.820]  talking about colorado but yeah yeah as long as you you need to keep it uh about 60 to 75 degrees
[03:18:18.820 --> 03:18:24.660]  that cool actually i think will make your buds dry a little more dense i think it hardens them
[03:18:24.660 --> 03:18:29.700]  up a little bit also i gotta mention dark uh you want that dry room dark drying and curing should
[03:18:29.700 --> 03:18:36.740]  happen in mostly a dark area i feel like literally a room exact two same climates one that's dark and
[03:18:36.740 --> 03:18:43.460]  one that's light uh the room with lights gonna the plants are gonna dry faster it's just kind of
[03:18:43.460 --> 03:18:48.740]  yeah just kind of experience i have with my dry room and keeping a window open sometimes and not
[03:18:50.340 --> 03:18:55.700]  and i know nothing else changed so so guys it is going to take a little bit of practice to get your
[03:18:55.700 --> 03:19:02.180]  drying and carrying method down right uh you may have to ruin a jar or two um seal that jar up go
[03:19:02.180 --> 03:19:06.820]  to sleep open it the next day and you open it it smells like ammonia you might have just kind of
[03:19:06.820 --> 03:19:11.060]  killed that crop if it's not moldy if you don't see any mold break it open as small as you can get
[03:19:11.060 --> 03:19:15.940]  those buds pour it out on a tray let it dry uh taste it give it a smoke see if it tastes all
[03:19:15.940 --> 03:19:19.940]  right it might be all right it might be smokable if you left it in there too long and it molded up
[03:19:19.940 --> 03:19:25.860]  throw it away remember what you did fix it next time don't do that same shit again yeah uh always
[03:19:25.860 --> 03:19:32.660]  start with clean jars clean jars yeah uh i spent a lot of time today uh cleaning jars and thinking
[03:19:32.660 --> 03:19:39.860]  man this really sucks this isn't you know but it's you know every little thing counts has anybody
[03:19:39.860 --> 03:19:43.860]  tried to cut off their feet and stick cloning gel on their ankles so that we can clean ourselves
[03:19:43.860 --> 03:19:48.900]  because we need to make more more growers it's hard to be a good grower sometimes there is so
[03:19:48.900 --> 03:19:54.180]  much like you got to do the growing work you got to do life and then you got to clean up after
[03:19:54.180 --> 03:19:57.780]  yourself and that's always the part that gets skipped and then you got to go start by cleaning
[03:19:57.780 --> 03:20:01.940]  tomorrow you guys keep your grow rooms clean because it builds up quickly and then you got
[03:20:01.940 --> 03:20:06.020]  to clone yourself because you just can't keep everything going i could two of me would crush
[03:20:06.740 --> 03:20:14.100]  yeah yeah if you have a lot of money and you have no shame and you want to clean pots and
[03:20:14.100 --> 03:20:19.620]  scrub floors and all that and come to colorado learn how to grow weed get in contact with us
[03:20:20.740 --> 03:20:25.220]  did you just make did you just offer an apprenticeship almost yeah but but they
[03:20:25.220 --> 03:20:29.140]  got to pay to start the company they're gonna pay to start it and then they're gonna be the
[03:20:29.140 --> 03:20:34.580]  employee that uh carries buckets and sweeps floors and mops up the shit for us yep and someday
[03:20:34.580 --> 03:20:38.980]  they'll be the bombest dispensary owner there is yeah we'll teach them how to grow definitely i
[03:20:38.980 --> 03:20:43.700]  need to pass on these skills to people because one day i'm gonna be not here i was gonna say get hit
[03:20:43.700 --> 03:20:48.420]  by a truck or something but i didn't want to jinx myself one day i'm gonna get hit by a bus you know
[03:20:48.420 --> 03:20:53.620]  and i'm not gonna be able to grow weed anymore the bus just flies through the house isn't that
[03:20:53.620 --> 03:21:00.420]  a line in a sublime song or something like that i don't know yeah some bulletproof vest
[03:21:00.660 --> 03:21:06.340]  okay yeah yeah i can't remember off the top of my head you can't remember most things off the
[03:21:06.340 --> 03:21:11.220]  top of your head well yeah but i'm the second biggest blind fan in the world so the second
[03:21:11.220 --> 03:21:18.500]  the second just try to take number one yeah yeah never do all right guys i feel like we've covered
[03:21:18.500 --> 03:21:22.500]  curing i don't know what else to add to this uh you're gonna mess up some stuff that's where i
[03:21:22.500 --> 03:21:28.180]  was it takes practice and patience you're not gonna get it right the first time yeah what you can do
[03:21:28.260 --> 03:21:36.420]  is uh go you can open it too often uh that's a good thing leaving it closed too long will screw
[03:21:36.420 --> 03:21:41.140]  you up so go in there and open it if you think maybe i need to open it do uh and then if you
[03:21:41.140 --> 03:21:45.060]  have another jar next to it don't open that one and just kind of compare take notes that's the
[03:21:45.060 --> 03:21:50.660]  best way to become a good grower and a good cure and dryer is to practice it and take notes what's
[03:21:50.660 --> 03:21:58.260]  your thoughts on rehydrating dry weed um you know i'm not a uh i'm not sponsored by this company
[03:21:58.260 --> 03:22:03.860]  but the humidifax the humidifax work great for rehydrating your buds i've been wondering what
[03:22:03.860 --> 03:22:09.380]  they'd be like for long term long-term storage as well um i've seen a lot of people throw their herb
[03:22:09.380 --> 03:22:13.940]  in a c vault which doesn't sponsor me either with a couple of humidifax and leave it for a really
[03:22:13.940 --> 03:22:22.100]  long time um but back to the dried out herb don't put lettuce or orange peels in your bags please
[03:22:22.100 --> 03:22:26.820]  that's kind of what i was getting at i see yeah yeah that'll make mold yeah that'll make your
[03:22:26.820 --> 03:22:32.420]  stuff not taste right it doesn't add flavor it may will but not the flavor you want added
[03:22:32.420 --> 03:22:39.460]  yeah yeah it'll be funky flavor unfortunately it doesn't work that way um what else was i uh
[03:22:39.700 --> 03:22:47.700]  uh curing uh herb that you've possibly purchased from someone you know just trying to help out
[03:22:47.700 --> 03:22:52.580]  listeners here there you go ask them so if you've got an herb that you don't feel is dry enough
[03:22:53.300 --> 03:22:58.820]  um if you've got some patience you can cure it if it's sticky you can leave it in the jar and let it
[03:22:59.540 --> 03:23:03.780]  let it kind of dry real slowly in the jar leave it in there overnight open it up check on it in
[03:23:03.780 --> 03:23:08.420]  the morning and leave it open for like 15 minutes and just repeat that every day until it's good or
[03:23:08.420 --> 03:23:14.740]  open it every six hours and check on it if you're impatient yeah brown paper sack possibly brown
[03:23:14.740 --> 03:23:19.860]  paper sacks are great because they kind of i did this when i was just starting i kind of think that
[03:23:19.860 --> 03:23:25.300]  they kind of make a little bit of a flavor in my buds now i do too and i've also lost a nice amount
[03:23:25.300 --> 03:23:31.060]  of weed a whole brown paper sandwich bag to mold i feel like it sped up the mold process i kind of
[03:23:31.060 --> 03:23:37.940]  feel like they may absorb oils as well very true but if you can time it right it's a great step
[03:23:37.940 --> 03:23:44.020]  between the hanging process and the jar yeah it's that one if you have to leave it out for if you've
[03:23:44.020 --> 03:23:48.100]  got to be away at work all day but you know it should be in the jar but it's not dry enough for
[03:23:48.100 --> 03:23:53.460]  the jar that bag is probably going to work for you there's a uh company ideal for someone

[03:25:36.500 --> 03:25:41.380]  um at the beginning of the show i mentioned that the city council meeting has been moved
[03:25:41.380 --> 03:25:45.300]  city council first planned the meeting for monday they knew it was a holiday they still wanted to
[03:25:45.300 --> 03:25:51.700]  meet but uh they changed their mind the meeting will now be tuesday at seven o'clock at city hall
[03:25:51.700 --> 03:25:55.460]  it's at one city hall plaza i wrote it down i said at the beginning of the show
[03:25:56.420 --> 03:26:01.700]  here it's on my phone i better make sure but go there uh jesse are you gonna be there bro
[03:26:01.700 --> 03:26:06.820]  oh you know i will be there i'm committing right now i got a little posse coming with me you got
[03:26:06.820 --> 03:26:11.380]  a posse nice yeah tuesdays are actually much better for me tuesday was kind of hard or monday
[03:26:11.380 --> 03:26:16.820]  was kind of hard so tuesday is way better so it's one city hall place tuesday at 7 p.m
[03:26:16.820 --> 03:26:22.740]  if you want to speak you have to be there about 6 30 and sign up please if you're gonna speak
[03:26:23.700 --> 03:26:28.340]  um trying to have some education about what you're saying don't go in there and cuss them
[03:26:28.340 --> 03:26:32.020]  out don't give them the finger i've seen people yell at city council before trying to prove a
[03:26:32.020 --> 03:26:36.580]  point and that doesn't help go in there and try to be if you've got a suit and a jacket wear that
[03:26:36.580 --> 03:26:44.340]  help us out make some notes yeah you know if you just there will most likely stay on if we do it
[03:26:44.340 --> 03:26:48.980]  right nobody will have to speak if we do it right a lot of us will show up and we've got a spokesperson
[03:26:48.980 --> 03:26:53.780]  i know who i would rather have speak for us mike get there first you go every week get there sign
[03:26:53.780 --> 03:26:58.820]  up speak our part mike knows exactly what to say so if we need a spokesperson he'll sign up and he
[03:26:58.820 --> 03:27:04.100]  definitely will speak hopefully after he speaks they just deny the thing what they're looking for
[03:27:04.100 --> 03:27:07.460]  hasn't even been submitted to or what they're talking about hasn't been shown to them yet we're
[03:27:07.460 --> 03:27:12.660]  gonna pre-empt this so they'll be like oh shit then maybe we shouldn't do that we don't want to
[03:27:12.660 --> 03:27:16.500]  see that yeah they don't want to mess with all 60 of us sitting there at the city council meeting
[03:27:16.500 --> 03:27:21.540]  telling them why it sucks they'll just go okay you're right they're pretty easy sometimes sometimes
[03:27:22.340 --> 03:27:25.620]  especially on a tuesday after a holiday no one's going to be in the mood to sit there
[03:27:27.620 --> 03:27:31.780]  i hope this works so you guys come out please come out and support us at the city council if
