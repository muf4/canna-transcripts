[00:00.000 --> 00:05.680]  Here we go! What's up podcast world? It's time for episode 490 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.680 --> 00:09.920]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now. If you need new regular,
[00:09.920 --> 00:14.960]  feminized or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now and you can
[00:14.960 --> 00:23.200]  find them at www.seedsherenow.com. You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about
[00:23.200 --> 00:29.200]  what I'm smoking. Today I've been taking dabs of sour animal live batter from our friends at
[00:29.200 --> 00:35.600]  Green Dot Labs. This is a blend of sour diesel and animal cookies BX3. The flavor is described
[00:35.600 --> 00:41.760]  as animal crackers, fuel and lemon cake. I really get the lemon cake. I for sure get the fuel.
[00:41.760 --> 00:47.200]  There is a sweetness, kind of a frosting flavor that I will say could be animal crackers. The one
[00:47.200 --> 00:52.720]  thing I certainly did get from this concentrate is stoned as fuck. I feel like my eyes are nice
[00:52.720 --> 00:57.680]  and heavy. I feel like I'm kind of lazy. My body feels nice and chill, nice and relaxed. I am ready
[00:57.680 --> 01:04.800]  for a great podcast. On the back of the package, it does say this product contains 61.43% THC
[01:04.800 --> 01:11.360]  and non-detectable amounts of CBD. I really approve of the sour animal live batter from our
[01:11.360 --> 01:16.400]  friends at Green Dot Labs. In this episode, I'm going to read an email that came from one of my
[01:16.400 --> 01:21.200]  Patreon supporters. But before I get to the message, let's do some shout outs to a few of
[01:21.200 --> 01:26.880]  our friends from Patreon. Let's give a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Oki Gro.
[01:26.880 --> 01:31.040]  How about a big Giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to JM. Let's give a big thank
[01:31.040 --> 01:35.760]  you shout out to Fat Rabbit. How about a big Giant Grow From Your Heart fist bump to Jacob W.
[01:35.760 --> 01:39.920]  Of course, I want to send a giant thank you to Steve F. I always want to send a giant thank you
[01:39.920 --> 01:44.880]  to James Brown. I need to send a big thank you high five to Keith K. Of course, I always want
[01:44.880 --> 01:51.040]  to send a fist bump to Baked PWN. And last but certainly not least, I want to send a big Grow
[01:51.040 --> 01:56.320]  From Your Heart podcast high five, a fist bump and a thank you to my buddy Dick Goals.

[02:18.480 --> 02:24.640]  of the way, let's jump right into this message that came from our buddy Dan Dank UK. Dan sent
[02:24.640 --> 02:31.200]  the message through Patreon and the message goes just like this. Hi Ross to Jeff. Greetings from
[02:31.200 --> 02:36.400]  the UK. Hey, thanks for listening way over there. It also says your podcast has given me a great
[02:36.400 --> 02:42.080]  education to make my next grow even better. So many thanks for that. You are very welcome. That
[02:42.080 --> 02:46.880]  is exactly my goal is to help you improve your garden and understand your plants better. So we
[02:46.880 --> 02:51.440]  are both reaching our goals. Congratulations and thanks for the compliment. It goes on to say,
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.200]  my question is I'm going to harvest my plants in about 10 days and this was my first grow.
[02:57.760 --> 03:03.760]  Some buds look great like lollipops, but some others are more the popcorn type. What is the
[03:03.760 --> 03:09.200]  best way to harvest these? Do they need to stay attached to a branch and hung up to dry? Or can
[03:09.200 --> 03:16.000]  some of these smaller buds dry sitting in a bowl? You can read my name, but it's fake as we are in
[03:16.000 --> 03:24.080]  prohibition here in England. Many thanks. Take care, dude, from dude Dank UK. Hey, my new friend,
[03:24.080 --> 03:28.400]  dude Dank with a fake name over there in the UK. Thank you for listening to the show. Thank you
[03:28.400 --> 03:32.800]  for the Patreon support and thank you for the great question. Let's talk a little bit about
[03:32.800 --> 03:38.080]  hanging or drying these little popcorn buds. It sounds like you've got the right idea. You
[03:38.080 --> 03:43.040]  said that some of your buds are lollipop type. That makes me think that you at least attempted
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.040]  to clean up the lower parts of your plants and you were mostly successful and you were able to
[03:47.040 --> 03:52.320]  get most of the energy up to the tops. It sounds like you've got a good grasp on growing. However,
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.840]  you did not lollipop sufficiently and you've got some little popcorn. We call it larf in my area.
[03:57.840 --> 04:02.080]  It's little larfy buds, just little popcorn nuggets, just little lowers. They probably
[04:02.080 --> 04:06.480]  could have been pinched off. That energy possibly could have gone up higher into the plant,
[04:06.480 --> 04:10.960]  but here we are at harvest and we've got some of these little popcorn buds. What do we do with
[04:10.960 --> 04:16.160]  them? Those buds do not have to stay on a stick or anything. They can get cut off. They can get
[04:16.160 --> 04:22.000]  put into a bowl. They can get put onto a tray. Oftentimes, growers use those tiered racks. They
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.160]  hang from the ceiling or they hang from something and it's a cylinder type thing with multiple
[04:26.160 --> 04:31.760]  shelves in there and it's all mesh. The main thing to think about is not letting these buds get
[04:31.760 --> 04:37.360]  pressed together or get too tightly squished so that you start getting any sort of a mold or a
[04:37.360 --> 04:41.840]  funky aroma or any problems like that from the buds being pressed together. We want plenty of
[04:41.840 --> 04:46.720]  airflow while they dry. Now, depending on the density of these little buds, you may want to
[04:46.720 --> 04:50.000]  spread them out a little bit. You may not want to put them in a bowl. You may want to put them
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.120]  flatter on something like a tray, but if they're fluffy, if they're really airy, a bowl shouldn't
[04:55.120 --> 04:59.920]  cause you any problems. Just pay attention to them. Maybe give them a stir every few hours
[04:59.920 --> 05:04.240]  just to make sure that none of that stuff is getting moldy, getting funky, getting too compressed
[05:04.240 --> 05:09.360]  on the bottom. Again, that all depends on how much of this little popcorn bud you've got and
[05:09.360 --> 05:14.960]  the density. It does not need to stay on the stick. It is really convenient just to chop it all off,
[05:14.960 --> 05:18.560]  spread it out, maybe trim it up a little bit. What are you going to do with it? Are you going
[05:18.560 --> 05:22.480]  to use it for smoke? Are you going to use it to make concentrates? Are you going to make edibles
[05:22.480 --> 05:26.640]  out of it? Decide what you want to do with it. If you're not even going to smoke it, you don't have
[05:26.640 --> 05:32.400]  to bother trimming that little stuff. Here in Colorado, cannabis is abundant. Anything that is
[05:33.040 --> 05:38.640]  of... I've got big thumbs. Anything that's not the size of most people's thumb gets tossed into what
[05:38.640 --> 05:44.000]  we call the hash pile, and we make concentrates out of that. If you're not going to smoke it as
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.160]  flour, don't bother trimming it. There's no need to take the time to take the leaves off of it.
[05:48.160 --> 05:52.640]  If you're going to turn it into edibles or a concentrate or make topicals out of it,
[05:52.640 --> 05:57.360]  or if it is going to be consumed any other way than by smoking it, don't bother trimming it
[05:57.360 --> 06:02.560]  because it is just going to be a waste of time. The short answer is yes, it should be safe to put
[06:02.560 --> 06:07.760]  those little popcorn buds on a tray or in a bowl. I would recommend something flatter and wider so
[06:07.760 --> 06:12.240]  they're not stacked up. Once they're a little drier, you can start bowling it, stacking it up a
[06:12.240 --> 06:17.280]  little bit, consolidating, saving some space. While it's fresh and wet, I may not stack it up. I may
[06:17.280 --> 06:21.840]  leave it nice and wide and spread out. It won't take too long for it to dry, especially if it's
[06:21.840 --> 06:25.920]  just popcorn buds. It should dry up quickly enough to where you can just gather it up into a bowl,
[06:25.920 --> 06:30.080]  and then you can handle it that way, just like you had intended. Again, it all depends on the
[06:30.080 --> 06:34.960]  size and density of those buds and how long it takes them to dry, how much moisture is in those
[06:34.960 --> 06:40.080]  buds at the time of harvest. Some people water their plants up till the day of harvest. Some
[06:40.080 --> 06:44.880]  folks will water if they're going to chop down tonight. Some people will still water today.
[06:44.880 --> 06:49.440]  Some people will stop watering a few days before harvest to kind of speed up the dry and cure
[06:49.440 --> 06:53.600]  process. But I think you're going to do great because you were smart enough to ask this
[06:53.600 --> 06:58.160]  question. You've already got the right idea. Congratulations on your first harvest. I hope
[06:58.160 --> 07:02.880]  it goes well. If you are comfortable with it, I would love to see some photos. And then I really
[07:02.880 --> 07:07.840]  look forward to seeing how we can improve your garden next time through just one cycle of
[07:07.840 --> 07:12.080]  practice, one cycle of trial and error, and then you get a few more episodes of the show under your
[07:12.080 --> 07:17.040]  belt. You've probably got some confidence now that you've got one successful harvest. I really look
[07:17.040 --> 07:21.920]  forward to seeing how you improve in your next cycle. So good luck with the next run. I hope
[07:21.920 --> 07:26.480]  this harvest cycle goes well. I hope you dry and cure it properly. Please listen to the dry and
[07:26.480 --> 07:31.200]  cure episode. And if you've got any questions about the dry and cure or about your next cycle,
[07:31.200 --> 07:36.080]  please send me more emails. I would love to help you out. Once again, big shout out to my new buddy
[07:36.080 --> 07:41.280]  Dude Dank UK from over there in England. Thank you for all of the Patreon support. And again,
[07:41.280 --> 07:46.000]  thank you for the great message. All right, now we're going to work on some listener emails.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.640]  This one came straight to the growfromyourheartathotmail.com email address. This one
[07:50.640 --> 07:55.200]  goes a lot like this. It says, what's up Rasta Jeff? My name is, we're going to skip the name
[07:55.200 --> 08:00.000]  because I'm not sure if they want me to say that, but the message goes just like this.
[08:01.040 --> 08:06.320]  My father-in-law to be passed during a heart valve replacement just two months before my
[08:06.320 --> 08:12.160]  upcoming wedding. Wow, that's heavy. I am sorry to hear that. The message goes on to say he had
[08:12.160 --> 08:18.400]  a way with any and all plants, a true Mr. Green thumb, and he was growing some cannabis outdoors
[08:18.400 --> 08:23.680]  tucked into his garden bed to gift out to his friends after the harvest. He doesn't even smoke
[08:23.680 --> 08:30.160]  anymore. He just loves this plant. That's wonderful and terrible. It sounds like you lost a wonderful
[08:30.160 --> 08:35.760]  person. The message goes on to say due to the fact that his wife would not have taken it well
[08:35.760 --> 08:41.440]  or appreciated it if she stumbled across the plants, his daughter, my fiance, and I had to
[08:41.440 --> 08:47.360]  perform operation, get the fuck out of Dodge and save these plants from being found. This is kind
[08:47.360 --> 08:53.040]  of a sad tale, but it is taking a very interesting twist. This is almost like a Hollywood movie that
[08:53.040 --> 08:58.560]  I would go watch. So let's keep going. It says, obviously we have taken on the task of finishing
[08:58.560 --> 09:03.920]  this round and I am keeping them indoors to finish flowering as they have vastly outgrown my tent
[09:03.920 --> 09:08.800]  limits and they're doing amazingly with the organic soil additives, which I have been adding,
[09:08.800 --> 09:15.040]  as well as worm castings from our personal worm composting bin. To keep the memory of this amazing
[09:15.040 --> 09:21.440]  man alive, I am attempting to keep these genetics going by cloning these plants. I have very minimal
[09:21.440 --> 09:26.800]  experience with growing, but I have never attempted cloning. All right, so let's talk about where we
[09:26.800 --> 09:33.440]  are so far on this. This person was getting married and their fiance's father-in-law passed
[09:33.440 --> 09:39.040]  during a heart valve replacement. This man who passed was growing cannabis in his outdoor garden
[09:39.040 --> 09:45.040]  to share with his friends. This man's daughter and new son-in-law have taken it upon themselves
[09:45.040 --> 09:50.480]  to rescue this plant, not only for the sake of the cannabis plant to preserve the plant and
[09:50.480 --> 09:56.640]  preserve its genetics, but also to preserve the past man's reputation because nobody knew he was
[09:56.640 --> 10:00.960]  growing and it would have made him look bad. So they got the plant the fuck out of there. They
[10:00.960 --> 10:07.520]  took it indoors. Now they are attempting to clone this plant to preserve the father's genetics,
[10:07.520 --> 10:13.120]  to preserve his work. So let's catch up into the email it says. When we saved them, they were
[10:13.120 --> 10:20.320]  already showing pre-flowers, so I cut clones ASAP. I used sterile blades. I follow your method as
[10:20.320 --> 10:25.120]  described in the podcast, dipped into rooting hormones, and placed the cuttings into root riot
[10:25.120 --> 10:30.880]  cubes that I soaked in distilled water and then squeezed the excess water out of. I purchased all
[10:30.960 --> 10:37.680]  necessities for a tent setup and got the clones a 7-inch dome under my LED light. I do have a
[10:37.680 --> 10:42.640]  seedling mat running due to the fact that it's in my basement in the cold New York concrete.
[10:42.640 --> 10:48.080]  The tray is off the ground with the mat just below providing minimal heat instead of direct contact.
[10:48.080 --> 10:52.240]  Alright, so the plants were starting to show pre-flower, so they decided to cut clones. That is
[10:52.240 --> 10:57.280]  okay. You've got great success rate from clones at that point. They purchased all of the equipment.
[10:57.280 --> 11:02.240]  They used sterile blades. They followed my method. They dipped the clones into rooting
[11:02.240 --> 11:07.280]  hormones and placed them into root riot cubes that were soaked in distilled water. So far,
[11:07.280 --> 11:12.240]  the distilled water is the only part that's got me concerned. Then we talk about the LED light.
[11:12.240 --> 11:17.200]  That should be okay. The heat mat, we may want a little bit more heat. I don't know the temperature
[11:17.200 --> 11:22.320]  in there, but if it's a cold New York basement, we may want that heat directly under those clones
[11:22.320 --> 11:27.200]  just to give them a little oomph. But again, I don't have a thermometer. I'm not there. I can't
[11:27.200 --> 11:30.960]  tell you exactly how cold it is. I'm just guessing. There is more to the message though.
[11:31.680 --> 11:36.720]  It goes on to say, it has been about four weeks and I still do not have roots. The leaves are
[11:36.720 --> 11:42.400]  beginning to turn slightly yellow, but everything else looks healthy. The humidity is kept high
[11:42.400 --> 11:47.920]  between 75 and 90%. The dome is constantly sweating and I spray the inside of the dome
[11:47.920 --> 11:54.320]  down with water, pH around 6 to 6.5 when it dries. I may have gone a little lower on the
[11:54.320 --> 12:00.160]  pH there. I may have gotten closer to six and not as close to six five. The humidity, I think you're
[12:00.160 --> 12:05.840]  doing okay. It says the temperature is kept between 70 and 80 between day and night. I have the lights
[12:05.840 --> 12:11.520]  set on an 18, six time schedule. So I may have gone just a touch warmer. I may have gone closer
[12:11.520 --> 12:18.080]  to 75 to 85 and I would have gone 24 hours a day of light. I would never have given them any dark
[12:18.080 --> 12:23.360]  time until I saw roots, probably until I transplant them, but that's okay. It was your first try.
[12:24.240 --> 12:29.680]  You did a great job trying. It goes on to say the lights are placed about 26 inches above the top of
[12:29.680 --> 12:34.160]  the dome. I would have gone much closer. I almost, let's see, I'm going to read about your light. I'm
[12:34.160 --> 12:40.400]  using a multi-spectrum LED 600 watt equivalent with only the veg spectrum activated at this time.
[12:40.400 --> 12:45.520]  Also, I am not using any nutrients. Okay. Your light may be correctly, the correct distance,
[12:45.520 --> 12:51.040]  since you're using an LED. If it were a T5, I'd go much closer. It sounds like your LED may be right.
[12:51.040 --> 12:55.840]  One thing I would do is put my hand right at the top of the dome and feel the heat. Is your hand
[12:55.840 --> 12:59.760]  comfortable there? Do you want to move your hand? If you want to move your hand, it is too warm. If
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.160]  you can just leave your hand there, then that light is not cooking the plants. It is probably okay.
[13:04.880 --> 13:11.200]  Now it does say I am not using any nutrients at this time. With the distilled water and the rapid
[13:11.200 --> 13:17.200]  rooters and the lack of nutrients and the 18-6 light schedule and probably a little bit of cold,
[13:17.200 --> 13:22.800]  I'm going to say those things are what added up to a lack of roots. The message goes on to say,
[13:22.800 --> 13:28.720]  could this slow root growth be due to the fact that the plants were in flower when cut? I really
[13:28.720 --> 13:33.440]  don't think that has anything to do with it. A lot of times, some growers like to take their cuts
[13:33.440 --> 13:37.680]  from plants which are in flower and then revert those to veg because it does make
[13:37.680 --> 13:43.760]  really monstrous clones. It says, are my lights too close? I am not familiar with your particular
[13:43.760 --> 13:49.680]  light. It sounds like you've got the right idea with it being 26 inches above the top of the dome.
[13:49.680 --> 13:54.160]  You've got only the veg spectrum activated. It should be right. Like I said, put your hand
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.640]  underneath there. See if it feels too warm. I don't think you're cooking them with the light,
[13:58.640 --> 14:05.280]  but honestly, I am not familiar with the LED and I'm not sure how strong that 600 LED is for those
[14:05.280 --> 14:09.760]  clones. I don't have that experience. That could be part of the problem. It doesn't sound like it
[14:09.760 --> 14:14.960]  to me from what I'm reading. The message goes on to say, is there anything else that you could see
[14:14.960 --> 14:21.040]  me doing incorrectly from this information? Yes. Like I mentioned before, I definitely would have
[14:21.040 --> 14:26.240]  some nutrients in those rapid rooters and I would definitely be feeding the plants some sort of feed.
[14:26.240 --> 14:31.120]  When you were spraying the dome, I would have some light nutrients in that water when you were
[14:31.120 --> 14:35.440]  spraying the dome. That is how the plants are going to get fed. They don't have any roots,
[14:35.440 --> 14:39.600]  so they're relying on the leaves to catch that foliar feed and keep them alive until they do
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.480]  root. That would have been very beneficial to put some nutrients in that spray when you were
[14:44.480 --> 14:49.600]  misting the domes. Then I think a little bit of heat would have helped you. Then having it on a
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.400]  24-hour light schedule definitely would have helped out. That would have encouraged roots
[14:54.400 --> 15:00.240]  to happen much more quickly. Unfortunately, if it has been four weeks since these clones were cut,
[15:00.240 --> 15:05.360]  I would start losing faith in them very soon. I don't keep anything around for four weeks. If it
[15:05.360 --> 15:10.480]  doesn't root by the third week, it is goodbye in my garden. I do understand that these plants are
[15:10.480 --> 15:15.760]  special to you. They're probably worth another week of trying. I would add some nutrients to
[15:15.760 --> 15:20.880]  that foliar feed that you're giving them when the dome dries out. I may rewater those plugs
[15:20.880 --> 15:25.840]  with something that's got a liquid beneficial bacteria, some sort of a root inoculant in there.
[15:25.840 --> 15:30.400]  If you can get some liquid great white, maybe some mammoth pea just to get some beneficial fungus
[15:30.400 --> 15:35.600]  into those clones and encourage some root growth. One mistake that a lot of new cloners make is
[15:35.600 --> 15:42.560]  they try to keep those plugs way too wet for way too long. Give them an opportunity to dry out.
[15:42.560 --> 15:47.120]  You don't want them dry and brittle, but when they start to get dry is when you are most likely to
[15:47.120 --> 15:51.680]  get roots popping. It's a funny joke amongst growers that you say, yeah, the best way to get
[15:51.680 --> 15:56.400]  my clones to root is to forget about them. You go, oh shit, I haven't checked on my clones in like
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.000]  two or three days. And you go look at them and they're starting to get a little bit dry and
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.880]  they're finally starting to root like a son of a bitch. So a little bit of dryness may help you out.
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.920]  Again, unfortunately, I feel like four weeks has passed the limit. They're probably starting to
[16:09.920 --> 16:14.560]  get a little bit of mold or rot where they're stuck into the clone plugs. They're probably
[16:14.560 --> 16:19.840]  losing life. It is probably game over for these clones. I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
[16:19.840 --> 16:24.960]  but it is probably too late to get these to root. Now, I know we really wanted to keep these
[16:24.960 --> 16:29.280]  genetics around because these were plants that came from a very special person. He obviously
[16:29.280 --> 16:34.400]  had a good heart. He was growing cannabis in his garden secretly. He doesn't even smoke.
[16:34.400 --> 16:38.880]  Maybe he secretly smokes too, and we just don't know that, but he says he doesn't smoke and he
[16:38.880 --> 16:43.600]  was passing out this herb to his friends to be a good person to share with people. That is super
[16:43.600 --> 16:49.680]  kind. What that makes me think is that this is the kind of guy that has probably got some seeds
[16:49.680 --> 16:56.400]  stashed somewhere amongst his personal possessions, somewhere in this man's area. Every old guy has an
[16:56.400 --> 17:01.440]  area. If it's your workshop, if it's your chair, if it's your stool, every old guy's got a space.
[17:01.440 --> 17:05.600]  As we get older, our space gets smaller. All of our shit ends up right here so we don't have to
[17:05.600 --> 17:11.760]  go anywhere to get it. That old guy has probably got some good seeds stashed away somewhere,
[17:11.760 --> 17:16.400]  and I encourage you to find those seeds, and I hope you get to grow those seeds to honor
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.240]  your father-in-law. Now, there is one more sentence to this message, and it says,
[17:20.240 --> 17:25.280]  if you need any further information or pictures, let me know. I've learned so much listening to
[17:25.280 --> 17:30.240]  your Grow Lesson series of podcasts during work. You are the fucking man. Hey, thank you. I
[17:30.240 --> 17:34.560]  appreciate that. It sounds like your father-in-law was the fucking man too, so big shout out to him.
[17:34.560 --> 17:39.520]  It says, I appreciate what you do and any help you may be able to provide to keep these particularly
[17:39.520 --> 17:44.640]  special plants cycling in our lives. Then they sign it with much love, and then their name. I'm
[17:44.640 --> 17:49.040]  not sure if they want that said. They know who they are. Hey, thank you for the great message.
[17:49.040 --> 17:55.120]  Thank you for this work that you did for this plant also. You came across a ganja plant that
[17:55.120 --> 17:59.680]  needed rescue. It was kind of a dog on the street, and you gave it shelter, and you tried to pet it,
[17:59.680 --> 18:03.360]  and you tried to feed it, and tried to love it like it was your own little puppy. So thanks for
[18:03.360 --> 18:07.280]  stepping up and taking care of the cannabis plant. It sounds like you bought all of the equipment to
[18:07.280 --> 18:12.000]  take care of this plant, so I'm wondering if you are still growing. Did you continue to grow? Would
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.040]  you like to continue to grow? Did you find any seeds in your father-in-law's stash? Do you need
[18:17.040 --> 18:22.000]  any seeds? Send me an email. Give me an update. Let me know how things are going in your garden.
[18:22.000 --> 18:26.000]  Let me know if you need any more help. I would love to get an update. And again, thank you for
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I feel like that is
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.240]  enough for a Thursday episode. I want to thank everybody for listening to this show. I'm going
[18:34.240 --> 18:38.560]  to wrap it up and start packaging more seeds for the IndoExpo. That's right, it never ends.
[18:38.560 --> 18:43.440]  Just package more seeds for the IndoExpo. IndoExpo, I hope to see you at the IndoExpo,
[18:43.440 --> 18:49.920]  January 25th and 26th in Denver, Colorado. The 25th is Industry Day. The 26th is open to the
[18:49.920 --> 18:55.920]  general public. Please get your tickets for the IndoExpo before you travel because it will sell
[18:55.920 --> 19:01.280]  out. Come stop by my booth. Come say hi. Grab some iRegenetics. Give me a high five. Take a selfie.
[19:01.280 --> 19:06.560]  I would love to meet you at the IndoExpo. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
