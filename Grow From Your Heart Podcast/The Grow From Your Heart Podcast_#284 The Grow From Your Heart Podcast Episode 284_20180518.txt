[00:12.040 --> 00:16.040]  Oh shit, lost a Jeff in the house.
[00:16.040 --> 00:21.040]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit.
[00:21.040 --> 00:23.040]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:23.040 --> 00:24.040]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:24.040 --> 00:26.040]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:26.040 --> 00:27.040]  Before you going back.
[00:27.040 --> 00:28.040]  Way back.
[00:28.040 --> 00:31.040]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:31.040 --> 00:32.040]  Hit it.
[00:33.040 --> 00:35.040]  Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[00:35.040 --> 00:40.040]  It's Thursday and that means it's time for another Throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:40.040 --> 00:43.040]  Before we get to the old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:43.040 --> 00:49.040]  If I mention any advertising, any giveaways, any promotions or any contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:49.040 --> 00:54.040]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:54.040 --> 00:57.040]  I want to thank you guys for listening and with no further ado,
[00:57.040 --> 01:01.040]  here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:17.180 --> 01:18.180]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[01:18.180 --> 01:22.180]  It's time for episode number 176 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:22.180 --> 01:25.180]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:25.180 --> 01:30.180]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:30.180 --> 01:34.180]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:34.180 --> 01:37.180]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:37.180 --> 01:39.180]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rostan Jeff.
[01:39.180 --> 01:40.180]  Thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:40.180 --> 01:46.180]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:46.180 --> 01:50.180]  Big shout to Kat, Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:51.180 --> 01:53.180]  Oh guys, I apologize for the clogged up throat there.
[01:53.180 --> 01:56.180]  I'm going to blame that one on everybody here at the table.
[01:56.180 --> 02:00.180]  There is a newcomer to the podcast sitting in front of me is my new friend, Shannon.
[02:00.180 --> 02:01.180]  Thank you for joining me.
[02:01.180 --> 02:02.180]  Thank you. Thank you for having me.
[02:02.180 --> 02:04.180]  Oh, thank you for bringing the dabbing granny.
[02:04.180 --> 02:05.180]  The dabbing granny is here.
[02:05.180 --> 02:08.180]  Yes, she drove me down.
[02:08.180 --> 02:10.180]  I'm trying to clear my throat and get this podcast started.
[02:10.180 --> 02:13.180]  But oh my gosh, when granny shows up, we take some dabs.
[02:13.180 --> 02:14.180]  What happens when you come here?
[02:15.180 --> 02:17.180]  We get high as fuck.
[02:17.180 --> 02:18.180]  Yes, we do.
[02:18.180 --> 02:21.180]  Also shout out to the Barefoot Grower for helping us out to get high as fuck.
[02:21.180 --> 02:23.180]  Yes, I met him for the first time.
[02:23.180 --> 02:25.180]  He had to run before the show started, but thanks for dropping by tonight, bro.
[02:26.180 --> 02:28.180]  Also, Repeat Offenders are here.
[02:30.180 --> 02:33.180]  She tried to mimic the whole entire intro, but she couldn't quite do it.
[02:33.180 --> 02:36.180]  She's recovered from a dab that she nearly died from a few minutes ago.
[02:37.180 --> 02:39.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Traveling Stoner is back on the podcast.
[02:39.180 --> 02:40.180]  Thanks for joining me.
[02:40.180 --> 02:41.180]  Are you okay after that dab?
[02:41.180 --> 02:42.180]  Yes, I'm totally good.
[02:42.180 --> 02:43.180]  I really am.
[02:43.180 --> 02:44.180]  Do you need a bottle of water?
[02:44.180 --> 02:45.180]  No, I totally have one over here.
[02:45.180 --> 02:46.180]  I'm totally good.
[02:46.180 --> 02:48.180]  That was 10 minutes ago, right?
[02:48.180 --> 02:49.180]  I know. I'm feeling better now.
[02:49.180 --> 02:50.180]  Thank you.
[02:50.180 --> 02:52.180]  And also, ladies and gentlemen, someone who's not on the show.
[02:52.180 --> 02:53.180]  He comes here often.
[02:53.180 --> 02:56.180]  He's kind of quiet, but the infamous Mr. Bobo Blaster Co. is here.
[02:56.180 --> 02:57.180]  The silent Bobo Blaster.
[02:57.180 --> 02:58.180]  Silent but deadly.
[02:58.180 --> 02:59.180]  Thanks for joining us, bro.
[03:00.180 --> 03:01.180]  Thank you for having me.
[03:01.180 --> 03:04.180]  Thanks for teaming up with me and making me not the only dude here.
[03:04.180 --> 03:05.180]  I was getting outnumbered.
[03:05.180 --> 03:06.180]  That's why I came here.
[03:06.180 --> 03:07.180]  I felt bad.
[03:07.180 --> 03:10.180]  I didn't want the odds to be that heavy.
[03:10.180 --> 03:12.180]  I think I could have handled it.
[03:12.180 --> 03:13.180]  Think about it, guys.
[03:13.180 --> 03:15.180]  We're going to talk about suppositories.
[03:15.180 --> 03:16.180]  Thank you, Granny.
[03:16.180 --> 03:24.180]  Three ladies that have already medicated by sticking a suppository up their rectums.
[03:24.180 --> 03:26.180]  I'm just going to turn that down the music.
[03:26.180 --> 03:27.180]  We're going to get right to this.
[03:27.180 --> 03:30.180]  So, yes, ladies and gentlemen, at separate times, don't be dirty,
[03:30.180 --> 03:31.180]  but at separate times this evening,
[03:31.180 --> 03:34.180]  these three ladies stepped into my lovely pink restroom.
[03:34.180 --> 03:36.180]  Nobody made fun of me for my pink restroom.
[03:36.180 --> 03:37.180]  Thank you.
[03:37.180 --> 03:38.180]  It is super pink in there.
[03:38.180 --> 03:41.180]  And they inserted and or applied some suppositories.
[03:41.180 --> 03:43.180]  Knuckle deep.
[03:43.180 --> 03:46.180]  We're going to talk about that in a little bit.
[03:46.180 --> 03:48.180]  I don't have my notes out where I can see them, but I have it all in my head.
[03:48.180 --> 03:50.180]  We're going to talk about knuckle deep.
[03:50.180 --> 03:53.180]  Since Shannon is the newcomer and also the provider of the suppositories,
[03:53.180 --> 03:56.180]  not you personally, your company, we're going to talk about that.
[03:56.180 --> 03:59.180]  Tell us a little bit about the company and tell us about suppositories.
[04:00.180 --> 04:03.180]  And then tell me about the dosage that everybody was just fed.
[04:03.180 --> 04:05.180]  My name is Shannon, obviously.
[04:05.180 --> 04:08.180]  I'm from Connoisseur Genetics and Concentrates is the name of the company.
[04:08.180 --> 04:09.180]  We're based in Denver.
[04:09.180 --> 04:11.180]  We are solventless company.
[04:11.180 --> 04:13.180]  We've got rosin products.
[04:13.180 --> 04:18.180]  That's kind of our main, our main products, but we also carry the ancillary products,
[04:18.180 --> 04:20.180]  bath bombs.
[04:20.180 --> 04:21.180]  You might have seen them around town.
[04:21.180 --> 04:27.180]  They've become very big, but our suppositories are just kind of that silent
[04:28.180 --> 04:32.180]  medication that nobody's talking about, but is so highly effective.
[04:32.180 --> 04:39.180]  And with the new levels of chemicals that are allowed in solvents or in your
[04:39.180 --> 04:43.180]  concentrates, it's just a smarter, I mean, if you're applying this and you need it
[04:43.180 --> 04:47.180]  for medical reasons, you don't necessarily want those chemicals involved.
[04:47.180 --> 04:52.180]  So it's just a much better application.
[04:52.180 --> 04:55.180]  There's people who want to be medicated during the day, but can't afford to be
[04:55.180 --> 04:57.180]  high due to their jobs.
[04:57.180 --> 05:00.180]  This does not get you high per se.
[05:00.180 --> 05:01.180]  There is a euphoric feeling.
[05:01.180 --> 05:05.180]  It's just that, you know, when you can manage something, symptoms that have been,
[05:05.180 --> 05:08.180]  you know, killing you, it's just nice.
[05:08.180 --> 05:12.180]  Like it's a euphoric feeling when that relief.
[05:12.180 --> 05:14.180]  I did not, oh, excuse me, guys.
[05:14.180 --> 05:16.180]  My throat is wrecked from hanging out with Will.
[05:16.180 --> 05:19.180]  I did not use a suppository tonight, but I have tried one, and euphoric is
[05:19.180 --> 05:21.180]  certainly one of the words I would use to describe it.
[05:21.180 --> 05:25.180]  None of my lower back pain was noticeable after using a suppository.
[05:25.180 --> 05:27.180]  So it definitely works for that.
[05:27.180 --> 05:29.180]  And it's the 70% absorption, right?
[05:29.180 --> 05:32.180]  I mean, edibles is 30, smoking is approximately 10.
[05:32.180 --> 05:35.180]  So it's the most effective way to get medicine.
[05:35.180 --> 05:38.180]  And you guys probably put them in, say, 30 minutes ago-ish?
[05:38.180 --> 05:40.180]  About that, yeah.
[05:40.180 --> 05:41.180]  How well are they?
[05:41.180 --> 05:42.180]  I cheated.
[05:42.180 --> 05:43.180]  Granny cheated.
[05:43.180 --> 05:44.180]  Well, Granny, you're always going a little hardcore.
[05:44.180 --> 05:45.180]  Let's hear what you did.
[05:45.180 --> 05:48.180]  I put one in at home and I put one in here.
[05:48.180 --> 05:49.180]  She doubled up.
[05:49.180 --> 05:50.180]  So one for the road.
[05:50.180 --> 05:51.180]  I knew you would.
[05:51.180 --> 05:57.180]  So that means Dab and Granny is actually medicated with 100 THC and 100 CBD.
[05:57.180 --> 06:02.180]  Me and Lindsey, since we've only done one, it's a 50-50, 50 THC, 50 CBD.
[06:02.180 --> 06:09.180]  But because we do cater to medical patients, I recently helped a colon
[06:09.180 --> 06:14.180]  cancer patient that's stage four and made 200-200 because that's what his
[06:14.180 --> 06:17.180]  recommended dosage, and that was just the most effective way for him to get
[06:17.180 --> 06:18.180]  that medicine.
[06:18.180 --> 06:19.180]  Are they working for him?
[06:19.180 --> 06:20.180]  We will find out.
[06:20.180 --> 06:23.180]  I just delivered those today specifically for that patient while I was down
[06:23.180 --> 06:24.180]  here.
[06:24.180 --> 06:25.180]  Hope those work.
[06:25.180 --> 06:26.180]  Thanks for coming all the way down to Pueblo also.
[06:26.180 --> 06:27.180]  I appreciate that.
[06:27.180 --> 06:28.180]  Absolutely.
[06:28.180 --> 06:29.180]  These guys are Colorado Springs dwellers.
[06:29.180 --> 06:30.180]  Springs.
[06:30.180 --> 06:31.180]  Colorado Springs.
[06:31.180 --> 06:32.180]  We're down here in the desert.
[06:32.180 --> 06:33.180]  It hasn't been the desert lately.
[06:33.180 --> 06:34.180]  It's nice today.
[06:34.180 --> 06:35.180]  Well, thanks for coming down.
[06:35.180 --> 06:36.180]  I appreciate it.
[06:36.180 --> 06:40.180]  So how many you got, 400, 200 milligrams in you?
[06:40.180 --> 06:41.180]  Only 100.
[06:41.180 --> 06:42.180]  Only 100, okay.
[06:42.180 --> 06:44.180]  How long did it take for the first one to kick in?
[06:44.180 --> 06:47.180]  Maybe 30 to 40 minutes.
[06:47.180 --> 06:50.180]  Lindsay, do you notice a difference since you don't go as frequently?
[06:50.180 --> 06:51.180]  Yeah, for sure.
[06:51.180 --> 06:56.180]  It definitely kicks in somewhere in the 30 to 40 minute range.
[06:56.180 --> 07:00.180]  It actually probably just kicked in about 10 minutes ago for me, and I
[07:00.180 --> 07:03.180]  really was like, why can't I feel my legs?
[07:03.180 --> 07:04.180]  That's right.
[07:04.180 --> 07:06.180]  You also took a dab that made you cough that probably got your blood
[07:06.180 --> 07:07.180]  pressure moving.
[07:07.180 --> 07:09.180]  No, this was actually before the dab.
[07:09.180 --> 07:12.180]  I looked down right before the dab, and I was like, why the hell?
[07:12.180 --> 07:13.180]  I was like, oh.
[07:13.180 --> 07:14.180]  Oh, yeah.
[07:14.180 --> 07:17.180]  It's kind of a wash over feeling that you get.
[07:17.180 --> 07:19.180]  It just kind of washes over you.
[07:19.180 --> 07:22.180]  I explained it that it starts sort of in your tummy, and then it sort of
[07:22.180 --> 07:24.180]  just spreads out, and you can feel the medicine happen.
[07:24.180 --> 07:27.180]  It never got above my chest region.
[07:27.180 --> 07:30.180]  I never felt any medication above that.
[07:30.180 --> 07:32.180]  I've got some shoulder pain from a car accident, and I never felt it there,
[07:32.180 --> 07:34.180]  but my knee pain was gone.
[07:34.180 --> 07:37.180]  My legs were, I don't know that I would want to take it the first two
[07:37.180 --> 07:39.180]  times and try to go to work.
[07:39.180 --> 07:41.180]  My job involves me on my feet working.
[07:41.180 --> 07:43.180]  I'm running laps basically all day.
[07:43.180 --> 07:46.180]  I don't know that my legs would have cooperated 100%.
[07:46.180 --> 07:49.180]  It might have been a little too much for a day's work.
[07:49.180 --> 07:55.180]  When we first created these suppositories, I was making 15-milligram
[07:55.180 --> 08:00.180]  and 25-milligram as well, but I think it just got to the point where if
[08:00.180 --> 08:04.180]  you're in that much pain that you're willing to stick something up your
[08:04.180 --> 08:08.180]  rear, it's going to need to be seriously medicated.
[08:08.180 --> 08:12.180]  I'm not doing it just for 15-milligrams, but for 50, I'll go for it.
[08:12.180 --> 08:16.180]  It seems to be the threshold is 50 is where everybody's comfortable
[08:16.180 --> 08:17.180]  jumping in that water.
[08:17.180 --> 08:21.180]  Do you see, what is your demographic that's using your product?
[08:21.180 --> 08:23.180]  Do you see an apprehension from males?
[08:23.180 --> 08:25.180]  Are they afraid of using your product?
[08:25.180 --> 08:31.180]  I get apprehension when, like if I'm giving out samples and I give out
[08:31.180 --> 08:34.180]  one to one person, they're apprehensive.
[08:34.180 --> 08:37.180]  But if I give two people, they will usually team up and be like,
[08:37.180 --> 08:39.180]  yeah, I'll do it if you do it.
[08:39.180 --> 08:41.180]  It's not gender specific.
[08:41.180 --> 08:43.180]  I think it kind of goes across the board.
[08:43.180 --> 08:49.180]  Really, the only thing we've focused on is the symptoms of helping with
[08:49.180 --> 08:53.180]  pain management or just the relief of that sensation.
[08:53.180 --> 08:59.180]  But for women, there's an alternate use as well that's not highly talked
[08:59.180 --> 09:05.180]  about and it makes men cringe, is that monthly mistress that comes and
[09:05.180 --> 09:07.180]  visits, it can be a bitch.
[09:07.180 --> 09:12.180]  If you have endometriosis or other things, men look at us and they know
[09:12.180 --> 09:15.180]  because they've seen their girlfriends wrench in pain, but they don't
[09:15.180 --> 09:16.180]  get it.
[09:16.180 --> 09:19.180]  Girls actually, if you say that, they're like, it relieves that?
[09:19.180 --> 09:22.180]  They are willing to use it.
[09:22.180 --> 09:24.180]  I'm sure Lindsey can attest to that.
[09:24.180 --> 09:26.180]  I know she suffers from that.
[09:26.180 --> 09:30.180]  Yeah, I actually have ovarian cysts, which is why I even have a medical
[09:30.180 --> 09:31.180]  card.
[09:31.180 --> 09:35.180]  I've suffered from it since I was about 16 years old.
[09:36.180 --> 09:42.180]  I truly didn't have full relief from my pain until I moved to Colorado and
[09:42.180 --> 09:46.180]  I had tried CBD for the first time, even just dabs.
[09:46.180 --> 09:49.180]  I couldn't believe how much that had taken away from me.
[09:49.180 --> 09:53.180]  Then the first time I ever took a suppository, I was in a lot of pain and
[09:53.180 --> 09:56.180]  Gail had given me one of them.
[09:56.180 --> 09:58.180]  I was like Gumby.
[09:58.180 --> 10:01.180]  You could barely move my bottom legs.
[10:01.180 --> 10:04.180]  I was just so stoned.
[10:04.180 --> 10:06.180]  Did you say your bottom legs?
[10:06.180 --> 10:08.180]  I did, didn't I?
[10:08.180 --> 10:11.180]  No one else caught it, did you?
[10:11.180 --> 10:14.180]  Nobody else caught it, too.
[10:14.180 --> 10:16.180]  That was the best one.
[10:16.180 --> 10:18.180]  My bottom legs.
[10:18.180 --> 10:22.180]  Sorry, my bottom half is what I meant to say.
[10:22.180 --> 10:24.180]  That was a good one.
[10:24.180 --> 10:27.180]  The podcast listeners might be envisioning you as a minotaur or
[10:27.180 --> 10:28.180]  something at this point.
[10:28.180 --> 10:30.180]  Like, wait, what is this lady?
[10:30.180 --> 10:32.180]  Damn, now I've got to go see what this bitch looks like.
[10:32.180 --> 10:34.180]  I wonder what her upper legs are looking like.
[10:34.180 --> 10:39.180]  But, Lindsay, would you say that the medicated feeling kind of comes in
[10:39.180 --> 10:40.180]  waves?
[10:40.180 --> 10:41.180]  Yes.
[10:41.180 --> 10:44.180]  You might think, okay, that's it, it's peaked.
[10:44.180 --> 10:48.180]  But no, you get a good 10 hours, sometimes 12 hours.
[10:48.180 --> 10:53.180]  And it seems like the medicine knows where to go except for shoulder and
[10:53.180 --> 10:54.180]  neck pain.
[10:54.180 --> 10:58.180]  It kind of, once it goes past the heart, that's kind of like you would
[10:58.180 --> 11:01.180]  have to, it would have to be applied differently.
[11:01.180 --> 11:03.180]  Because the heart is kind of there.
[11:03.180 --> 11:05.180]  It's running these blood vessels.
[11:05.180 --> 11:06.180]  Edibles get to my shoulders.
[11:06.180 --> 11:08.180]  If I eat it, it goes to my head and shoulders.
[11:08.180 --> 11:10.180]  It's a smart plant.
[11:10.180 --> 11:13.180]  I've said that cannabis knows where to go on this podcast.
[11:13.180 --> 11:15.180]  Our receptors are like, help me, help me.
[11:15.180 --> 11:17.180]  It finds the pain, it tickles the pain, it massages that out.
[11:17.180 --> 11:19.180]  And if there's leftovers, it goes to your brain and makes you a little
[11:19.180 --> 11:20.180]  high.
[11:20.180 --> 11:21.180]  That's the way I feel cannabis does.
[11:21.180 --> 11:25.180]  Or if you consume like we do, it goes right to your brain.
[11:25.180 --> 11:27.180]  And then it goes to the other places.
[11:27.180 --> 11:28.180]  It knows.
[11:28.180 --> 11:29.180]  It is very smart.
[11:29.180 --> 11:30.180]  I was actually, Lindsay texted me.
[11:30.180 --> 11:32.180]  I was trying to hang out with Lindsay one day.
[11:32.180 --> 11:33.180]  I was like, you want to hang out?
[11:33.180 --> 11:36.180]  And she's like, I hurt so bad I can't even hang out.
[11:36.180 --> 11:38.180]  And I said, did you put one of those suppositories in there?
[11:38.180 --> 11:40.180]  And she was like, yeah.
[11:40.180 --> 11:41.180]  And I was like, okay.
[11:41.180 --> 11:42.180]  I actually recommended it.
[11:42.180 --> 11:44.180]  I was like, this might sound crazy, but go ahead and try that.
[11:44.180 --> 11:46.180]  And she's like, and they're done that already.
[11:46.180 --> 11:48.180]  Don't think I didn't think of that shit.
[11:48.180 --> 11:49.180]  That was two hours ago, Jeff.
[11:49.180 --> 11:51.180]  I'm still here, bro.
[11:51.180 --> 11:55.180]  I mean, I guess in a sense you can say it gets you high, but it's not the
[11:55.180 --> 11:57.180]  mental psychosis anxiety.
[11:57.180 --> 11:59.180]  There's nothing mental.
[11:59.180 --> 12:02.180]  Anything above the shoulders is basically not touch.
[12:02.180 --> 12:05.180]  It's a floaty sort of my feet aren't touching the ground properly kind of a
[12:05.180 --> 12:06.180]  thing.
[12:06.180 --> 12:07.180]  Yeah.
[12:07.180 --> 12:08.180]  My socks were too thick.
[12:08.180 --> 12:09.180]  Yeah.
[12:09.180 --> 12:10.180]  Just they got the tingles.
[12:10.180 --> 12:13.180]  Shannon, one thing we do need to say to the ladies since you brought it up
[12:13.180 --> 12:18.180]  about monthly cycles, I recommend it all the time, but we need to let them
[12:18.180 --> 12:22.180]  know, don't do this vaginally.
[12:22.180 --> 12:23.180]  You can.
[12:23.180 --> 12:24.180]  Well, you can.
[12:24.180 --> 12:29.180]  But if you think about it, your monthly cycle is to flush things out.
[12:29.180 --> 12:33.180]  So if you're going to insert that suppository into your vagina, you're
[12:33.180 --> 12:35.180]  going to flush the medicine back out.
[12:35.180 --> 12:36.180]  Right.
[12:36.180 --> 12:39.180]  Not to say.
[12:39.180 --> 12:40.180]  Pre-medicate maybe?
[12:40.180 --> 12:41.180]  Maybe.
[12:41.180 --> 12:43.180]  Wouldn't putting it in your butt do the same thing?
[12:43.180 --> 12:45.180]  Basically, it's going to get it there.
[12:45.180 --> 12:46.180]  Yeah.
[12:46.180 --> 12:49.180]  But you have more membranes in your butt, so you might as well go.
[12:49.180 --> 12:50.180]  Yeah.
[12:51.180 --> 12:55.180]  I know there was a lady and they wasn't our suppositories.
[12:55.180 --> 13:00.180]  I didn't have any heart in it, but I do know that she had had bladder cancer
[13:00.180 --> 13:05.180]  or something more on the female area.
[13:05.180 --> 13:09.180]  So she used them vaginally, and the cysts were going away with chemo on the
[13:09.180 --> 13:11.180]  outside, but they weren't going away on the inside.
[13:11.180 --> 13:15.180]  So by using the suppositories, she was able to reduce the ulcers on the
[13:15.180 --> 13:16.180]  inside.
[13:16.180 --> 13:19.180]  But she wasn't on her cycle when she was inserting them.
[13:19.180 --> 13:22.180]  She might not even have had one anymore, depending on age.
[13:22.180 --> 13:23.180]  Right.
[13:23.180 --> 13:27.180]  So we probably have all agreed, don't use it vaginally when you are on your
[13:27.180 --> 13:28.180]  period.
[13:28.180 --> 13:32.180]  But if you do have an ovarian cyst, maybe put it in there if you're seeking
[13:32.180 --> 13:33.180]  relief and not on your cycle.
[13:33.180 --> 13:34.180]  So to be honest with you-
[13:34.180 --> 13:36.180]  And on your period, put it in your butt to get the pain relief.
[13:36.180 --> 13:37.180]  I kind of agree with-
[13:37.180 --> 13:38.180]  You have-
[13:38.180 --> 13:40.180]  Jesus.
[13:40.180 --> 13:42.180]  I kind of agree with Gail here.
[13:42.180 --> 13:47.180]  To be honest with you, I have only ever really put one in my vagina one or two
[13:47.180 --> 13:48.180]  times.
[13:48.180 --> 13:52.180]  Every other time that I've used them, which has been about a dozen now, has
[13:52.180 --> 13:57.180]  all been in my butt because, oh man, there's a lot of reasons.
[13:57.180 --> 13:59.180]  You know I'm going to cut that into a sound right, right?
[13:59.180 --> 14:00.180]  That's fine.
[14:00.180 --> 14:02.180]  About a dozen times in my butt.
[14:02.180 --> 14:06.180]  Dammit, and I know that because you just showed me the spine.
[14:06.180 --> 14:07.180]  Oh, are you really?
[14:07.180 --> 14:08.180]  No, well maybe.
[14:08.180 --> 14:09.180]  Oh yeah, probably.
[14:09.180 --> 14:11.180]  I'm sure he's got a spoofing.
[14:11.180 --> 14:14.180]  No, honestly, I hope so because that's going to be an awesome ass-
[14:14.180 --> 14:15.180]  We can auto-tune that.
[14:15.180 --> 14:16.180]  That's going to be good.
[14:16.180 --> 14:17.180]  We can do that.
[14:17.180 --> 14:18.180]  I'm going to beat at it.
[14:18.180 --> 14:19.180]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[14:19.180 --> 14:20.180]  Not 12 times in my butt.
[14:20.180 --> 14:21.180]  My butt.
[14:21.180 --> 14:23.180]  All right, sorry, I just derailed a section.
[14:23.180 --> 14:24.180]  No, that's cool because-
[14:24.180 --> 14:25.180]  Back on track.
[14:25.180 --> 14:27.180]  Sell it to Sloppy, he can rap over it.
[14:27.180 --> 14:29.180]  Oh my God, yes.
[14:29.180 --> 14:32.180]  Sloppy, I hope you're listening to this, my dude, because we're going to film it
[14:32.180 --> 14:33.180]  at Canna Canyon.
[14:33.180 --> 14:34.180]  It's going to be perfect.
[14:34.180 --> 14:36.180]  Camille gets work to do.
[14:36.180 --> 14:37.180]  Yes.
[14:37.180 --> 14:38.180]  I love my family.
[14:38.180 --> 14:39.180]  Squad.
[14:39.180 --> 14:40.180]  I love my weed family.
[14:40.180 --> 14:41.180]  We have a great family.
[14:41.180 --> 14:42.180]  We do.
[14:42.180 --> 14:43.180]  We do.
[14:44.180 --> 14:47.180]  The suppository figure that's on here is just a black whatever.
[14:47.180 --> 14:50.180]  You know at Halloween they have those full black bodysuit things that are just-
[14:50.180 --> 14:53.180]  We can totally be suppository dudes.
[14:53.180 --> 14:56.180]  Suppository dudes doesn't-
[14:56.180 --> 15:00.180]  Shannon, maybe we should tell them about the size of the suppositories just because
[15:00.180 --> 15:02.180]  they do cringe just-
[15:02.180 --> 15:03.180]  I was just going to say that to you.
[15:03.180 --> 15:07.180]  The other thing that I really wanted before I forget because I'm really stoned, I
[15:08.180 --> 15:13.180]  like to throw them in the freezer for about five to ten minutes before I use it.
[15:13.180 --> 15:17.180]  That way, because I'm an idiot and I leave them in my- When I first get them, I leave
[15:17.180 --> 15:19.180]  them in my bag or somewhere and they kind of-
[15:19.180 --> 15:20.180]  They melt.
[15:20.180 --> 15:21.180]  They not melt, but they just get a little soft.
[15:21.180 --> 15:22.180]  Butter up.
[15:22.180 --> 15:23.180]  Exactly.
[15:23.180 --> 15:24.180]  Just like our concentrates.
[15:24.180 --> 15:28.180]  They just get a little bit soft and I don't want to have any issues, any crumble, any
[15:28.180 --> 15:33.180]  breakage, so I throw it in the freezer just so it hardens up just that tiny bit and then
[15:33.180 --> 15:36.180]  it's super easy to insert and there's no issues with it.
[15:36.180 --> 15:40.180]  If you're looking for a super easy way to do it, that is my tip for that.
[15:40.180 --> 15:41.180]  That is how I-
[15:41.180 --> 15:43.180]  I typically store mine in the refrigerator or the freezer.
[15:43.180 --> 15:48.180]  We keep them in the freezer at one night once they cure and everything and I seal them.
[15:48.180 --> 15:52.180]  It's definitely a cooler temperature, obviously.
[15:52.180 --> 15:54.180]  We don't use coconut oil.
[15:54.180 --> 16:01.180]  The reason that we don't, and if you check any YouTubes or any of those type of forums,
[16:01.180 --> 16:04.180]  they will all say use coconut oil.
[16:04.180 --> 16:08.180]  Well, we don't use coconut oil because there's a lot of people who have allergies to it that
[16:08.180 --> 16:10.180]  have developed, so we try to avoid that.
[16:10.180 --> 16:17.180]  We actually use cocoa butter and beeswax and so that's why ours are a little- they stay
[16:17.180 --> 16:22.180]  firmer even when they're not in the freezer like some of the others I know because when
[16:22.180 --> 16:26.180]  they're made out of coconut oil, the second you touch it, it starts to melt regardless
[16:26.180 --> 16:27.180]  of how you've stored it.
[16:28.180 --> 16:34.180]  I try to be conscious of all common allergies and things that may affect patients, especially
[16:34.180 --> 16:37.180]  when their immune system is already being compromised.
[16:37.180 --> 16:39.180]  You said you make them out of solventless.
[16:39.180 --> 16:43.180]  Can you teach our listeners that may not know what solventless hash is, can you give them
[16:43.180 --> 16:45.180]  a quick lesson and if you need a hand, we'll jump in.
[16:45.180 --> 16:46.180]  Yeah, absolutely.
[16:46.180 --> 16:47.180]  Thank you.
[16:47.180 --> 16:50.180]  I actually kind of have this one.
[16:50.180 --> 16:55.180]  Depending on what kind of concentrate we're making, we make- everything is done with either
[16:55.180 --> 16:58.180]  heat and pressure or ice and water.
[16:58.180 --> 17:01.180]  We don't use any chemicals throughout the process.
[17:01.180 --> 17:04.180]  I mean, they're solvent-free, which means there are solvents used, but they've been
[17:04.180 --> 17:05.180]  removed.
[17:05.180 --> 17:08.180]  For us, we never- this product never touches a solvent.
[17:08.180 --> 17:09.180]  Okay.
[17:09.180 --> 17:13.180]  Even in our grow, it's as close to organic as you can get.
[17:13.180 --> 17:18.180]  To get certified organic costs a lot of money and we're still new, so that's in our coming
[17:19.180 --> 17:24.180]  days or years probably when we can truly go full organic.
[17:24.180 --> 17:29.180]  But with the process, things are removed.
[17:29.180 --> 17:36.180]  So, if it's star melt, say we make it into hash with ice and water.
[17:36.180 --> 17:37.180]  Okay.
[17:37.180 --> 17:39.180]  We've got a hash guy that makes that.
[17:39.180 --> 17:41.180]  And then from there, we press that.
[17:41.180 --> 17:42.180]  We'll sift it.
[17:42.180 --> 17:44.180]  We get the truthful melt and we get our different microns.
[17:45.180 --> 17:48.180]  And then from there, if it doesn't meet our standards of truthful melt, then we press
[17:48.180 --> 17:50.180]  it into rosin.
[17:50.180 --> 17:58.180]  And that just is- it's a 95% typically THC level about that.
[17:58.180 --> 18:01.180]  And we always have the testing on those and it varies a little.
[18:01.180 --> 18:02.180]  All right.
[18:02.180 --> 18:05.180]  For our nug melt, we just take the flour.
[18:05.180 --> 18:10.180]  It's all about how you cure it, how it's grown, the strains you use are important.
[18:10.180 --> 18:11.180]  Right.
[18:11.180 --> 18:15.180]  And we just take it and it's processed down and we just press the flour with heat and
[18:15.180 --> 18:20.180]  pressure, which makes a rosin as well, which is becoming more and more popular.
[18:20.180 --> 18:21.180]  Right.
[18:21.180 --> 18:23.180]  A lot of my listeners might not know, so I'm going to give them just a- it's basically,
[18:23.180 --> 18:29.180]  you're taking a really high tech George Foreman grill and squishing a bud into a George Foreman
[18:29.180 --> 18:31.180]  grill and some juice drips out of it.
[18:31.180 --> 18:33.180]  And that juice is very potent.
[18:33.180 --> 18:38.180]  I am not a huge fan of rosin smoking by itself because I usually don't like the flavor.
[18:38.180 --> 18:42.180]  If it's done right, if it's made, if you take hash and make rosin out of hash, that
[18:42.180 --> 18:43.180]  tastes good.
[18:43.180 --> 18:45.180]  But I don't think squishing the bud makes a flavorful.
[18:45.180 --> 18:48.180]  A lot of people are huge fans of it and they're going to hate me for that.
[18:48.180 --> 18:49.180]  Yes, they are, Jeff.
[18:49.180 --> 18:50.180]  They are.
[18:50.180 --> 18:52.180]  But it's not, it tastes like, it all tastes like burnt popcorn or a popsicle stick.
[18:52.180 --> 18:57.180]  Now, and that's where the differentiation is with nug melt.
[18:57.180 --> 18:59.180]  That means it's not being done right.
[18:59.180 --> 19:00.180]  Okay.
[19:00.180 --> 19:03.180]  If it's not being done right, which means it's being exposed to either too long to the
[19:03.180 --> 19:07.180]  heat or too high of a temperature for too long, you get that popcorn.
[19:07.180 --> 19:08.180]  Okay.
[19:08.180 --> 19:09.180]  Burnt popcorn, exactly.
[19:09.180 --> 19:10.180]  Thank you.
[19:10.180 --> 19:14.180]  And I'm not going to say it's never happened in our kitchen, but if that happens, those
[19:14.180 --> 19:16.180]  could turn into ancillary products, bath bombs.
[19:16.180 --> 19:20.180]  Like that's not something that we would put on the shelf as something that we would say
[19:20.180 --> 19:23.180]  smoke this because it doesn't taste right.
[19:23.180 --> 19:28.180]  You know, we've really worked on perfecting the cure and the taste and when we press it,
[19:28.180 --> 19:30.180]  the time and it's a science.
[19:30.180 --> 19:34.180]  So, and that's something that we've been really working on for a long time.
[19:34.180 --> 19:40.180]  So, I believe there was, I think we had some nug melt here.
[19:40.180 --> 19:42.180]  I'll make sure that you actually get to try it.
[19:42.180 --> 19:45.180]  I'll prove your popcorn prophecy.
[19:45.180 --> 19:46.180]  I'd love to dab it.
[19:46.180 --> 19:48.180]  I'm not a hater just from experience.
[19:48.180 --> 19:50.180]  And you are 100% correct.
[19:50.180 --> 19:53.180]  If it is not done right, that's exactly what it tastes like.
[19:53.180 --> 19:54.180]  Okay.
[19:54.180 --> 19:55.180]  Well, it sounds like you guys have mastered the tech.
[19:55.180 --> 19:59.180]  So you're taking properly done rosin and then making that into a liquid that's able to be
[19:59.180 --> 20:01.180]  put into the suppositories?
[20:01.180 --> 20:02.180]  Correct.
[20:02.180 --> 20:03.180]  Okay.
[20:03.180 --> 20:04.180]  So I have a formula.
[20:04.180 --> 20:05.180]  I have a formulation.
[20:05.180 --> 20:10.180]  I know what calculations to make as far as to make potencies and whatnot.
[20:10.180 --> 20:13.180]  And based on how many I'm making, it's formula.
[20:13.180 --> 20:19.180]  And I just take the rosin and the CBDs and just melt it down within the cocoa butter.
[20:19.180 --> 20:20.180]  You know your ratios.
[20:20.180 --> 20:21.180]  I know my ratios.
[20:21.180 --> 20:22.180]  Proprietary mixtures and such.
[20:22.180 --> 20:23.180]  Correct.
[20:23.180 --> 20:25.180]  And you had said something about size, Gail.
[20:25.180 --> 20:32.180]  And you know, size is, if I said, you know, the end of your pinky, that's going to vary
[20:32.180 --> 20:34.180]  because everybody's pinky is a different size.
[20:34.180 --> 20:40.180]  So it's two grams is what it weighs out in amount.
[20:40.180 --> 20:42.180]  So it's a liquid.
[20:42.180 --> 20:43.180]  Maybe a half an inch?
[20:43.180 --> 20:44.180]  Half an inch.
[20:44.180 --> 20:46.180]  You know, a torpedo, a small torpedo.
[20:46.180 --> 20:47.180]  Like an Advil liquid.
[20:47.180 --> 20:51.180]  I mean, they're the same size as a fleet suppository.
[20:51.180 --> 20:52.180]  There you go.
[20:52.180 --> 20:56.180]  I mean, if you've ever used any type of suppository, it's the exact same size.
[20:56.180 --> 21:01.180]  We're buying the same molds from the same companies that the major players buy from.
[21:01.180 --> 21:04.180]  Somebody out there is going to argue with us and say that water is a solvent.
[21:04.180 --> 21:11.180]  Yes, we know water is a solvent, but it's not being used as a, we get that, but it's being used more as an agitator in this situation.
[21:11.180 --> 21:13.180]  And it's not a harmful solvent.
[21:13.180 --> 21:15.180]  Right, but still people are haters.
[21:15.180 --> 21:17.180]  And so I just want to leave them a footnote.
[21:17.180 --> 21:18.180]  We get it.
[21:18.180 --> 21:19.180]  Water is a solvent.
[21:19.180 --> 21:20.180]  In this situation, it's not.
[21:20.180 --> 21:23.180]  The ice is being used as more like a beater to break off the trichome.
[21:23.180 --> 21:26.180]  So don't, don't get at me because I know someone's going to say that.
[21:26.180 --> 21:27.180]  And it's RO.
[21:27.180 --> 21:29.180]  So it's, of course, it's filter.
[21:29.180 --> 21:36.180]  But isn't it solventless in the fact that like the water isn't changing the properties of it.
[21:36.180 --> 21:42.180]  Whereas like when BHO and PHO has run through it, it physically changes it and chemically changes it.
[21:42.180 --> 21:44.180]  It depends on how big of an internet troll you are.
[21:44.180 --> 21:46.180]  That's why I'm telling everybody to stop.
[21:46.180 --> 21:47.180]  But that's what I'm saying.
[21:47.180 --> 21:52.180]  That ends it right there because water doesn't change the chemical properties of it at all.
[21:52.180 --> 21:56.180]  You need to text that to Nikity so that he can use that because Nikity is the one that tells us about water.
[21:56.180 --> 21:58.180]  He will say, he will say this is solvent.
[21:58.180 --> 21:59.180]  Yeah.
[21:59.180 --> 22:00.180]  Shout out to Nikity.
[22:00.180 --> 22:01.180]  No, he's the one that tells us that water is not a solvent.
[22:01.180 --> 22:05.180]  He's the one that's always got to give that speech because he created the hashtag solventless.
[22:05.180 --> 22:06.180]  Gotcha.
[22:06.180 --> 22:07.180]  Yeah.
[22:07.180 --> 22:08.180]  All right.
[22:08.180 --> 22:09.180]  I'm going to put it back on track.
[22:09.180 --> 22:10.180]  I know where I was.
[22:10.180 --> 22:11.180]  We're talking about the size of suppositories.
[22:11.180 --> 22:12.180]  Yes.
[22:12.180 --> 22:13.180]  Let's talk about my favorite word insertion.
[22:13.180 --> 22:15.180]  It's not that bad, you guys.
[22:15.180 --> 22:17.180]  A lot of dudes, a lot of people looking at me like, really?
[22:17.180 --> 22:19.180]  You're going to put that in your butt, bro?
[22:19.180 --> 22:23.180]  Like they said, you're not putting, you guys.
[22:23.180 --> 22:24.180]  You're not using a dildo.
[22:24.180 --> 22:25.180]  You eat all day.
[22:25.180 --> 22:26.180]  You take giant shit.
[22:26.180 --> 22:27.180]  Nothing's not going to affect your butt.
[22:27.180 --> 22:30.180]  Like it's smaller than any poop you've ever thrown out.
[22:30.180 --> 22:31.180]  Don't be scared.
[22:31.180 --> 22:34.180]  But right there, Jeff, is what you men say.
[22:34.180 --> 22:38.180]  No, that hole is meant for stuff to come out, not stuff to go in.
[22:38.180 --> 22:39.180]  A lot of, yeah.
[22:39.180 --> 22:43.180]  At first when you say suppository, that's what my natural reaction is.
[22:43.180 --> 22:44.180]  But then I think I'm a logical dude.
[22:44.180 --> 22:45.180]  I understand science.
[22:45.180 --> 22:46.180]  I understand my body.
[22:46.180 --> 22:47.180]  I know how this is going to work.
[22:47.180 --> 22:48.180]  How high are we going to get?
[22:48.180 --> 22:49.180]  Let's do this.
[22:49.180 --> 22:54.180]  It's not, so it just, literally, he just put it in your butt, you guys.
[22:54.180 --> 22:57.180]  You got like, about a knuckle, maybe a knuckle and a half.
[22:57.180 --> 23:03.180]  And if you're that frightened, put a little lubricant just like you were having sex.
[23:03.180 --> 23:05.180]  I mean, it's already a lubricant in itself.
[23:05.180 --> 23:06.180]  You're cocoa butter.
[23:06.180 --> 23:08.180]  I don't think you need it.
[23:08.180 --> 23:10.180]  Do you, Lindsay?
[23:10.180 --> 23:11.180]  No, no, definitely not.
[23:11.180 --> 23:12.180]  You guys are laughing.
[23:12.180 --> 23:13.180]  What's the story over here?
[23:13.180 --> 23:14.180]  I want to know what I missed.
[23:14.180 --> 23:15.180]  You got to spin on it.
[23:15.180 --> 23:16.180]  You got to spin on it.
[23:16.180 --> 23:17.180]  Spin on it.
[23:17.180 --> 23:21.180]  I was jokingly spitting in my hand as you turned to me, and I was like, oh, Jesus Christ.
[23:21.180 --> 23:23.180]  We were just exchanging glances.
[23:23.180 --> 23:27.180]  My friends at work were like, how do you know how, when it's in right?
[23:27.180 --> 23:30.180]  Well, if you push too far, your body pushes it down a little.
[23:30.180 --> 23:31.180]  It's like, nope.
[23:31.180 --> 23:33.180]  And then if you don't go far enough, it falls out.
[23:33.180 --> 23:35.180]  It's called that second sphincter muscle.
[23:35.180 --> 23:36.180]  Really?
[23:36.180 --> 23:37.180]  You know, Jeff.
[23:37.180 --> 23:38.180]  It kind of sucks it up.
[23:38.180 --> 23:40.180]  It just sits comfortably right in one spot.
[23:40.180 --> 23:41.180]  Kind of.
[23:41.180 --> 23:46.180]  You'll know it's there, but it only lasts a couple of minutes, like five, six, maybe.
[23:46.180 --> 23:51.180]  And this is going to sound crazy, but I mean, I guess whenever I'm high, I'll just say this.
[23:52.180 --> 23:57.180]  As long as you get it completely in, you can kind of like squeeze your butt cheeks and
[23:57.180 --> 24:00.180]  push it the rest of the way without needing to get knuckle deep.
[24:00.180 --> 24:01.180]  That's what I'm saying.
[24:01.180 --> 24:02.180]  It'll kind of put itself where it needs to be.
[24:02.180 --> 24:03.180]  Yeah.
[24:03.180 --> 24:04.180]  It kind of just goes up there.
[24:04.180 --> 24:08.180]  If you're really that squeamish about your butt hole, you can just like get it all the
[24:08.180 --> 24:12.180]  way in there physically, and then you can just use your own butt cheeks to just squeeze
[24:12.180 --> 24:13.180]  it in there.
[24:13.180 --> 24:15.180]  And then wash your hands before you come take depth.
[24:15.180 --> 24:16.180]  Please do.
[24:16.180 --> 24:17.180]  Yeah, for sure.
[24:17.180 --> 24:18.180]  Don't fist bump me.
[24:18.180 --> 24:19.180]  Let me disclose.
[24:19.180 --> 24:24.180]  Since you are possibly inserting your finger, you do want to wash your hands before you
[24:24.180 --> 24:25.180]  hand.
[24:25.180 --> 24:26.180]  Oh, yes.
[24:26.180 --> 24:27.180]  Right.
[24:27.180 --> 24:29.180]  But let me just say that because there'll be those that'll be like, oh, I was supposed
[24:29.180 --> 24:31.180]  to wash my hands before too?
[24:31.180 --> 24:32.180]  You know.
[24:32.180 --> 24:33.180]  Yeah.
[24:33.180 --> 24:34.180]  We're not all savages.
[24:34.180 --> 24:35.180]  Wash your hands, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:35.180 --> 24:36.180]  You damn heathens.
[24:36.180 --> 24:37.180]  All right.
[24:37.180 --> 24:41.180]  I'm going to bring up another thing that maybe people are squeamish to talk about, but I
[24:41.180 --> 24:42.180]  do get asked this.
[24:42.180 --> 24:43.180]  Do it.
[24:43.180 --> 24:44.180]  What about leakage?
[24:44.180 --> 24:45.180]  Okay.
[24:45.180 --> 24:48.180]  See, I'm glad you said that because that's exactly what I was going to say earlier when
[24:48.180 --> 24:49.180]  you derailed and I realized that two minutes ago.
[24:49.180 --> 24:52.180]  I mean, guys, we are truly talking medicating here.
[24:52.180 --> 24:53.180]  That's why I've only put it in there.
[24:53.180 --> 24:57.180]  So some of the subjects might be, and if you're 15 years old, then don't listen to us.
[24:57.180 --> 25:00.180]  This is, we are truly talking about medicating here.
[25:00.180 --> 25:02.180]  And it's not all going to be suppository talk.
[25:02.180 --> 25:05.180]  You guys are going to talk more stuff also.
[25:05.180 --> 25:10.180]  This is going to sound crazy, but like, I mean, like I don't put them in vaginally because
[25:10.180 --> 25:15.180]  I am always afraid that like I'm going to take a dab afterwards and cough really hard
[25:15.180 --> 25:16.180]  or like, right.
[25:16.180 --> 25:17.180]  And like do, and like.
[25:17.180 --> 25:18.180]  Two soundbites in one show.
[25:18.180 --> 25:19.180]  How many soundbites can we rack up in a podcast?
[25:19.180 --> 25:20.180]  Um, but yeah, I, it's, I mean, it's not like a super big, like fear of mine.
[25:20.180 --> 25:21.180]  Like, I mean, like don't be children.
[25:21.180 --> 25:22.180]  I don't think it's going to just fall out of my vagina.
[25:22.180 --> 25:23.180]  I don't think I have like a anyways.
[25:23.180 --> 25:24.180]  So.
[25:24.180 --> 25:25.180]  You ho, you dab ho.
[25:25.180 --> 25:26.180]  Three, three soundbites.
[25:26.180 --> 25:27.180]  Um, I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
[25:27.400 --> 25:51.680]  But anyways, yeah, so that's why I actually don't use them
[25:51.680 --> 25:52.680]  that way.
[25:52.680 --> 25:55.160]  Cause I'm super afraid of like.
[25:55.160 --> 25:56.160]  Sneezing.
[25:56.160 --> 25:57.160]  Yeah.
[25:57.160 --> 25:59.160]  I can see the tears coming out of everybody's faces
[25:59.160 --> 26:00.800]  on this podcast right now.
[26:00.800 --> 26:01.640]  This is great.
[26:01.640 --> 26:03.160]  We had a moment.
[26:03.160 --> 26:04.000]  Yeah.
[26:04.920 --> 26:06.320]  We're all best friends now.
[26:08.320 --> 26:10.280]  I'm finally coming back around from the dabs
[26:10.280 --> 26:11.200]  that I had earlier.
[26:11.200 --> 26:12.680]  Geez, Will came over and he's like,
[26:12.680 --> 26:14.000]  try this Skywalker hash.
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.840]  And he gave me like at least a half gram.
[26:15.840 --> 26:16.680]  And as I was taking it, I was like,
[26:16.680 --> 26:18.480]  well, there goes the fucking podcast.
[26:19.680 --> 26:21.640]  Shannon and I were the first ones here.
[26:21.640 --> 26:25.200]  And I looked at Will and Jeff and I was like,
[26:25.200 --> 26:26.160]  what's wrong with these two?
[26:26.160 --> 26:28.480]  Are they tired or something?
[26:28.480 --> 26:29.520]  Skywalker goddess.
[26:29.520 --> 26:31.600]  I looked at Jeff and I was like, you look tired.
[26:31.600 --> 26:32.800]  And he's like, no.
[26:32.800 --> 26:33.640]  No, I slept well.
[26:33.640 --> 26:34.800]  I'm just kind of high.
[26:34.800 --> 26:36.560]  I'm dabbed out for a minute.
[26:36.560 --> 26:37.720]  Yes, I'm coming around.
[26:37.720 --> 26:39.760]  Shout out to Dr. Pepper and good friends at laughter
[26:39.760 --> 26:40.600]  for bringing me back on.
[26:40.600 --> 26:41.440]  I'm gonna have to take a dab in a minute.
[26:41.440 --> 26:42.280]  Cheers, peers.
[26:42.280 --> 26:43.120]  Yes.
[26:43.120 --> 26:43.960]  Yes.
[26:43.960 --> 26:45.920]  I'm gonna have to take a dab in a second, fix myself.
[26:45.920 --> 26:46.760]  All right, Lindsay, I just did real joke.
[26:46.760 --> 26:49.000]  But we never really finished about leakage.
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.440]  No, I mean, but honestly.
[26:50.440 --> 26:51.760]  And her gaping hold it thing.
[26:53.720 --> 26:55.120]  Yeah, please start that rumor.
[26:55.160 --> 26:56.560]  Jesus Christ.
[26:56.560 --> 27:00.720]  So I've never personally experienced leakage with the anal.
[27:00.720 --> 27:02.320]  Me neither.
[27:02.320 --> 27:05.080]  With either one of them, but.
[27:05.080 --> 27:07.600]  But it's possible because it's a liquid product.
[27:07.600 --> 27:09.720]  If you don't go far enough, yes.
[27:09.720 --> 27:12.080]  I mean, if you're timid and you don't
[27:12.080 --> 27:13.520]  and it's hanging on the edge, yeah,
[27:13.520 --> 27:14.360]  it's probably gonna have a little leakage.
[27:14.360 --> 27:16.080]  And there's gonna be some meltage.
[27:16.080 --> 27:17.680]  Yes, it's gonna come out in your underwear.
[27:17.680 --> 27:19.560]  And you're gonna be basically wasting the medicine
[27:19.560 --> 27:22.640]  and it's not gonna be absorbing if it is.
[27:22.640 --> 27:26.240]  So if that happens, like it's not the end of the world,
[27:26.240 --> 27:27.880]  wash your clothes, wash your underwear.
[27:27.880 --> 27:28.720]  And.
[27:28.720 --> 27:29.560]  Go to the dispenser and get another one.
[27:29.560 --> 27:30.400]  Go get another one.
[27:30.400 --> 27:31.240]  Push further.
[27:31.240 --> 27:32.360]  Push a little further, go a little deeper.
[27:32.360 --> 27:33.600]  Yep, go a little deeper.
[27:33.600 --> 27:36.160]  But in reality, there should not be any leakage.
[27:36.160 --> 27:39.040]  No, I have yet to have any.
[27:39.040 --> 27:41.720]  Any, I know potato chips that have given me
[27:41.720 --> 27:44.240]  worse side effects than I've had from.
[27:44.240 --> 27:45.720]  From.
[27:45.720 --> 27:46.680]  Chipotle has done worse things.
[27:46.680 --> 27:47.520]  Yes.
[27:47.520 --> 27:52.520]  So I really couldn't say that there's any super negative
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.200]  side effects that stand out to me.
[27:57.200 --> 27:58.040]  Would you?
[27:58.040 --> 27:59.640]  No, not at all.
[27:59.640 --> 28:00.480]  So.
[28:00.480 --> 28:01.320]  Not at all.
[28:01.320 --> 28:02.160]  Here's a random question.
[28:02.160 --> 28:03.000]  If somebody gets ahold of these
[28:03.000 --> 28:03.820]  and they don't have the proper labeling
[28:03.820 --> 28:05.320]  and they eat one, what's gonna go wrong?
[28:05.320 --> 28:06.160]  Nothing there.
[28:06.160 --> 28:08.880]  But it's basically 50 milligrams THC
[28:08.880 --> 28:10.040]  and 50 milligrams CBD.
[28:10.040 --> 28:13.320]  It is gonna be processed through your liver and stomach.
[28:13.320 --> 28:15.520]  So you are probably going to get a head high
[28:15.520 --> 28:17.000]  and not feel a lot of pain relief.
[28:17.480 --> 28:18.720]  It's going to be a different high.
[28:18.720 --> 28:19.560]  But it is edible.
[28:19.560 --> 28:21.680]  It's cocoa butter and it's beeswax.
[28:21.680 --> 28:22.520]  It's nothing.
[28:22.520 --> 28:24.120]  It's organic.
[28:24.120 --> 28:27.200]  But we do ask that you be responsible medicators
[28:27.200 --> 28:29.680]  and keep these products away from your children
[28:29.680 --> 28:30.640]  and your pets.
[28:30.640 --> 28:31.480]  Yes.
[28:31.480 --> 28:32.320]  Right.
[28:32.320 --> 28:33.140]  Yes.
[28:33.140 --> 28:34.600]  What type of, I was gonna ask,
[28:34.600 --> 28:35.840]  could we use these for our pets?
[28:35.840 --> 28:38.040]  But then I was like, I don't even want to
[28:38.040 --> 28:39.440]  journey down that road right now
[28:39.440 --> 28:41.000]  after the conversation we just had.
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.960]  So I'm gonna go with another question.
[28:42.960 --> 28:43.800]  What are.
[28:43.800 --> 28:45.920]  Are you gonna insert it in my dog's ass?
[28:46.920 --> 28:47.760]  Come here Fido.
[28:47.760 --> 28:49.640]  Does that go back to the horse thing?
[28:50.800 --> 28:54.640]  So these young ladies had a conversation
[28:54.640 --> 28:57.800]  about a documentary where people were having sex
[28:57.800 --> 28:58.720]  with their farm animals.
[28:58.720 --> 28:59.760]  I did not bring it up.
[28:59.760 --> 29:01.160]  I didn't start it.
[29:01.160 --> 29:03.240]  These ladies did this to us here earlier.
[29:03.240 --> 29:04.720]  What I was gonna ask really though was
[29:04.720 --> 29:07.120]  what type of conditions would you recommend?
[29:07.120 --> 29:08.960]  Like if you had just a list of conditions
[29:08.960 --> 29:10.640]  and if you're like suppositories, we'll fix that.
[29:10.640 --> 29:12.000]  What would you go for first?
[29:12.960 --> 29:17.440]  Pain in any kind of symptoms that you have
[29:17.440 --> 29:20.020]  where you need that extra relief.
[29:21.720 --> 29:25.840]  I would say nerve ending.
[29:25.840 --> 29:28.040]  I'm gonna say anybody,
[29:29.240 --> 29:30.840]  can I use my own personal experience?
[29:30.840 --> 29:31.680]  Once a year, granny.
[29:31.680 --> 29:33.560]  Those are the best ways to describe things.
[29:33.560 --> 29:37.120]  I took a year and I weaned my husband off opioids
[29:37.120 --> 29:39.160]  with the help of these suppositories.
[29:39.160 --> 29:40.080]  Oh wow.
[29:40.080 --> 29:40.960]  Okay.
[29:40.960 --> 29:44.520]  And with CBDs and suppositories, Kevin is now opioid free.
[29:44.520 --> 29:45.560]  Congrats Kevin.
[29:45.560 --> 29:48.000]  And he was stubborn about cannabis, wasn't he?
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.360]  He will smoke, but he didn't wanna do suppositories.
[29:51.360 --> 29:52.960]  He didn't wanna do CBDs.
[29:52.960 --> 29:54.560]  He's an old hippie.
[29:54.560 --> 29:56.280]  He'll smoke his bowls.
[29:56.280 --> 29:57.120]  Okay.
[29:57.120 --> 29:58.640]  But at the beginning of 2016,
[29:58.640 --> 30:03.640]  he was on 75 micrograms of fentanyl,
[30:03.760 --> 30:06.560]  which was to be changed every 72 hours.
[30:07.440 --> 30:11.560]  40 milligrams of extended release morphine,
[30:11.560 --> 30:13.440]  two times a day.
[30:13.440 --> 30:18.000]  15 milligrams of immediate release morphine,
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.200]  five times a day as needed.
[30:20.200 --> 30:22.720]  So he was basically a numb zombie?
[30:22.720 --> 30:23.560]  Yeah.
[30:23.560 --> 30:24.840]  He was falling down a lot.
[30:24.840 --> 30:26.560]  And I was like, enough of this shit.
[30:26.560 --> 30:28.600]  Not eating, not pooping, not communicating.
[30:28.600 --> 30:30.240]  That's when Shannon and I first met,
[30:30.240 --> 30:31.640]  I was like, I can't do this.
[30:31.640 --> 30:33.280]  And she was like, well, I'll help you.
[30:33.280 --> 30:35.680]  She gave me some products.
[30:35.680 --> 30:37.360]  She gave me those suppositories.
[30:37.360 --> 30:40.560]  At first he said, you stick that up your butt.
[30:40.560 --> 30:41.920]  And I said, are you kidding?
[30:41.920 --> 30:45.000]  After 45 years of marriage, you're gonna tell me that?
[30:45.000 --> 30:46.440]  Are you kidding me?
[30:46.440 --> 30:49.120]  Stick this little pinky thing compared to some.
[30:51.080 --> 30:55.480]  I said, okay, if I do it, you have to do it.
[30:55.480 --> 30:56.800]  I did it, he did it.
[30:56.800 --> 30:59.000]  And he's like, you're right, they're not so bad.
[30:59.000 --> 31:00.360]  If I remember correctly,
[31:00.360 --> 31:02.600]  it was he had had a colonoscopy that day.
[31:02.600 --> 31:04.760]  So you were like, you've already had it stretched out.
[31:04.800 --> 31:07.080]  You might as well just go for it.
[31:07.080 --> 31:09.000]  It's already inflated.
[31:09.000 --> 31:11.840]  So that was when he said, you know what, you're right.
[31:11.840 --> 31:13.800]  Like I've already been violated once.
[31:13.800 --> 31:15.120]  And they work.
[31:15.120 --> 31:18.800]  So he is someone that is in a lot of chronic pain.
[31:18.800 --> 31:23.200]  I mean, to be prescribed that much morphine to begin with.
[31:23.200 --> 31:24.960]  Absolutely, are those the coins?
[31:24.960 --> 31:26.160]  That looks like a quarter?
[31:26.160 --> 31:27.000]  What?
[31:27.000 --> 31:28.280]  The morphine pills?
[31:28.280 --> 31:29.880]  No, they're actually very small.
[31:29.880 --> 31:31.240]  Okay.
[31:31.240 --> 31:33.160]  And then, you know, then the government has gotten
[31:33.160 --> 31:34.800]  to the point also where they're like,
[31:34.800 --> 31:38.480]  oh, we're gonna let you take all these pills for 10 years.
[31:38.480 --> 31:39.800]  And now we're gonna take them away from you.
[31:39.800 --> 31:41.960]  Yeah, that happened to a friend of mine recently.
[31:41.960 --> 31:44.960]  Yes, and then we have people going out onto the streets
[31:44.960 --> 31:46.640]  and they're buying them.
[31:46.640 --> 31:49.520]  And we're getting more heroin addicts now
[31:49.520 --> 31:52.520]  because heroin is cheaper than pills on the street.
[31:52.520 --> 31:55.600]  So guys, I'm telling you, cannabis,
[31:55.600 --> 31:58.520]  I'll tell you if you have an opioid addiction,
[31:59.400 --> 32:02.320]  these suppositories help you get rid of it.
[32:02.360 --> 32:05.440]  Because when you start kicking opioids, you get sick.
[32:05.440 --> 32:06.840]  Yeah.
[32:06.840 --> 32:11.560]  Even if you try to wean slowly, you get sick.
[32:11.560 --> 32:12.840]  Your body missing it.
[32:12.840 --> 32:14.560]  You've been spoiling yourself.
[32:14.560 --> 32:16.400]  Right, yeah, but your body doesn't know that yet.
[32:16.400 --> 32:17.560]  So yeah.
[32:17.560 --> 32:19.680]  But well, congrats to, is he still as grumpy?
[32:19.680 --> 32:20.520]  Yeah.
[32:20.520 --> 32:21.360]  All right.
[32:21.360 --> 32:22.200]  But he's going to Vegas with me.
[32:22.200 --> 32:23.040]  Live up to his name.
[32:23.040 --> 32:24.840]  Well, do we wanna brag about that for a second?
[32:24.840 --> 32:25.680]  Are we done?
[32:25.680 --> 32:26.520]  We should finish this talk.
[32:26.520 --> 32:27.520]  Okay, let's keep talking about why.
[32:27.520 --> 32:29.200]  I have a good way of putting this back sometimes.
[32:29.200 --> 32:30.320]  I might forget though, but.
[32:30.320 --> 32:31.160]  Yeah, no.
[32:31.160 --> 32:32.040]  Because of more conditions.
[32:32.720 --> 32:36.120]  So obviously, I mean, any kind of lower extremities,
[32:36.120 --> 32:39.480]  I would say anywhere from the heart down,
[32:39.480 --> 32:43.440]  you could find relief in some way.
[32:43.440 --> 32:45.240]  It just depends on what your symptoms are.
[32:45.240 --> 32:47.640]  I mean, because it's a one-to-one ratio,
[32:47.640 --> 32:51.520]  50-50 THC and CBD, you're getting the benefits of both.
[32:51.520 --> 32:55.760]  So it's just, the two catalyze each other.
[32:55.760 --> 32:58.120]  It's just overall beneficial.
[32:58.120 --> 33:00.160]  I mean, the list could go on and on,
[33:00.200 --> 33:02.000]  but I mean, for me personally,
[33:02.000 --> 33:05.800]  it's nerve damage, sciatic nerve issues.
[33:05.800 --> 33:08.400]  I was almost paralyzed in a jet ski accident.
[33:08.400 --> 33:12.960]  So, it flares up from time to time and it swells up.
[33:12.960 --> 33:14.840]  So, and that's what I use them for.
[33:14.840 --> 33:17.280]  Girls obviously use them for endometriosis.
[33:17.280 --> 33:21.240]  Cancer patients use it to relieve symptoms
[33:22.440 --> 33:26.160]  from their cancer, whatever it might be.
[33:26.160 --> 33:28.440]  I mean, colon cancer.
[33:28.440 --> 33:32.240]  If you're on chemo, you're probably really nauseous.
[33:32.240 --> 33:33.080]  And what are they gonna do?
[33:33.080 --> 33:34.760]  They're gonna give you pharmaceuticals.
[33:34.760 --> 33:37.960]  They're gonna give you Chitrel, Zofran.
[33:37.960 --> 33:39.600]  There's all these pills they're gonna give you
[33:39.600 --> 33:40.640]  so you don't get sick.
[33:40.640 --> 33:41.480]  Well, guess what?
[33:42.360 --> 33:43.280]  You don't need those pills.
[33:43.280 --> 33:45.960]  You can insert one of these suppositories.
[33:45.960 --> 33:47.640]  It's gonna help with the nauseousness.
[33:47.640 --> 33:49.440]  It's gonna help with the pain.
[33:49.440 --> 33:51.400]  It's not going to cure your cancer.
[33:51.400 --> 33:52.600]  That's not what we're saying,
[33:52.600 --> 33:56.160]  but it will make the quality of what you're going through
[33:56.160 --> 33:57.800]  at that time better.
[33:57.800 --> 34:00.800]  It'll make it, I think it will.
[34:00.800 --> 34:01.640]  Absolutely.
[34:01.640 --> 34:04.400]  I mean, we've all experienced it in our own experiences.
[34:04.400 --> 34:07.320]  And that's why I'm such an advocate for this.
[34:07.320 --> 34:11.320]  I mean, the 70% absorption rate is huge.
[34:11.320 --> 34:14.160]  When you smoke things, it's about a 10% ratio.
[34:14.160 --> 34:15.720]  When you eat it, it's 30%.
[34:15.720 --> 34:18.920]  So they're getting 70% of that 50-50.
[34:18.920 --> 34:20.480]  And that's a huge amount.
[34:20.480 --> 34:21.760]  Quickly, very quickly.
[34:21.760 --> 34:22.600]  Yeah, it comes on quickly.
[34:22.600 --> 34:24.480]  And it lasts for quite a long time.
[34:24.480 --> 34:25.880]  Like, I don't know, when I take dabs,
[34:25.880 --> 34:28.320]  I get maybe a good 30, 40-minute buzz out of it.
[34:28.320 --> 34:29.680]  But the suppositories-
[34:29.680 --> 34:30.520]  Oh, you're lucky.
[34:30.520 --> 34:31.720]  Well, you know, the lingering part,
[34:31.720 --> 34:33.480]  that 15 minutes of, oh, it's cool.
[34:33.480 --> 34:34.920]  But then you just get that, I might be kinda,
[34:34.920 --> 34:36.720]  still, I could use some cookies or something.
[34:36.720 --> 34:38.200]  But yeah, they come on quickly,
[34:38.200 --> 34:39.920]  and they seem to last a long time.
[34:39.920 --> 34:41.960]  Yeah, the waves go for quite a while.
[34:41.960 --> 34:42.920]  Yeah, the waves.
[34:42.920 --> 34:44.160]  Yeah, the waves are fun.
[34:44.160 --> 34:45.800]  I noticed that for sure, for sure.
[34:45.800 --> 34:47.440]  I was thinking maybe I would take them
[34:47.440 --> 34:49.480]  if I had to go on a plane ride or a car trip
[34:49.480 --> 34:50.680]  where I'm sitting for a long time,
[34:50.680 --> 34:51.960]  because my lower back and my knees
[34:51.960 --> 34:53.160]  start to get mad about that.
[34:53.160 --> 34:55.400]  So it might be cool to have those on a plane trip
[34:55.400 --> 34:56.880]  or something where I'm cramped in the car.
[34:56.880 --> 34:58.160]  I have that same, like,
[34:58.160 --> 34:59.360]  anytime I'm sitting for a long time,
[34:59.360 --> 35:02.440]  and I drive a lot, just with calling on dispensaries
[35:02.440 --> 35:04.520]  and just getting the word out.
[35:04.520 --> 35:07.280]  So I don't typically do it while I'm driving,
[35:07.280 --> 35:09.520]  just because, like you said, it kind of deadens,
[35:09.520 --> 35:10.880]  like, I wanna have my reaction times.
[35:10.880 --> 35:14.280]  But as soon as I stop or have, you know,
[35:14.280 --> 35:17.280]  at the end of the day, I'm taking them for the relief.
[35:17.280 --> 35:18.840]  Right, computer time when you're home
[35:18.840 --> 35:20.000]  doing the computer work,
[35:20.000 --> 35:20.840]  sitting there in the chair
[35:20.840 --> 35:22.200]  letting your bottom half go numb.
[35:22.200 --> 35:23.520]  Yeah. Sounds perfect.
[35:23.520 --> 35:24.760]  All right, I like it.
[35:24.800 --> 35:25.880]  It's a good product.
[35:25.880 --> 35:28.120]  You guys all have the same look on your face.
[35:28.120 --> 35:28.960]  Everybody's-
[35:28.960 --> 35:29.800]  We're all stoned.
[35:29.800 --> 35:30.760]  Yeah, everybody that uses a suppository
[35:30.760 --> 35:31.840]  had the same look on their face.
[35:31.840 --> 35:33.440]  They were all bobbing their head at the same rhythm.
[35:33.440 --> 35:34.280]  That was pretty funny.
[35:34.280 --> 35:37.160]  What other products do you carry though at CGC?
[35:37.160 --> 35:38.040]  Yeah.
[35:38.040 --> 35:41.080]  We also, one of our highest things
[35:41.080 --> 35:44.880]  that we've been popular have been our bath bombs.
[35:44.880 --> 35:46.720]  They have, we have three different kinds.
[35:46.720 --> 35:50.600]  There's a hundred milligram THC with 15 CBD.
[35:50.600 --> 35:52.800]  Again, we've got the solventless in there.
[35:52.800 --> 35:54.120]  They're foaming bath bombs.
[35:54.120 --> 35:56.520]  So they have the experience.
[35:56.520 --> 35:58.640]  There's actually bubbles involved and-
[35:58.640 --> 35:59.520]  Colors?
[35:59.520 --> 36:00.880]  Colors are involved.
[36:00.880 --> 36:02.480]  We don't heavily color them.
[36:02.480 --> 36:05.000]  Again, want to keep it as clean as possible.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.360]  But there is a color in there, of course,
[36:07.360 --> 36:09.840]  differentiate scents and things like that.
[36:09.840 --> 36:11.400]  Lavender and citrus ginger.
[36:11.400 --> 36:16.000]  And I know Granny, when I offered her products,
[36:17.000 --> 36:18.640]  she loves our solventless caviar,
[36:18.640 --> 36:20.780]  loves the suppositories, obviously.
[36:21.620 --> 36:24.580]  You know, definitely dabs our rosin.
[36:24.580 --> 36:27.460]  But she was like, yeah, I'm not a bath person.
[36:27.460 --> 36:28.300]  And so I respected that.
[36:28.300 --> 36:29.140]  I'm not.
[36:29.140 --> 36:29.980]  You don't take baths, Granny?
[36:29.980 --> 36:30.820]  No, I like showers.
[36:30.820 --> 36:31.980]  I don't either.
[36:31.980 --> 36:32.820]  I should just throw it out there.
[36:32.820 --> 36:33.660]  I'm a shower guy.
[36:33.660 --> 36:34.820]  I don't want to lay in my own dirty.
[36:34.820 --> 36:36.820]  So recently she caught a cold
[36:36.820 --> 36:39.500]  and I saw her on Facebook or on Instagram
[36:39.500 --> 36:40.540]  on one of her live feeds.
[36:40.540 --> 36:42.100]  And I was heading down this way.
[36:42.100 --> 36:44.500]  So I just, I dropped some stuff off
[36:44.500 --> 36:46.100]  at one of our Epic Remedies,
[36:46.100 --> 36:48.660]  one of the local dispensaries that we do business with.
[36:48.660 --> 36:50.420]  And Granny, I know shops there.
[36:51.100 --> 36:53.180]  And we all do.
[36:53.180 --> 36:54.420]  Yeah, I was just going to say that.
[36:54.420 --> 36:55.260]  Yeah, they're a great company.
[36:55.260 --> 36:56.740]  I think I'm dabbing some stuff from there now.
[36:56.740 --> 36:57.580]  Right?
[36:57.580 --> 37:00.380]  So I just dropped it off and texted her.
[37:00.380 --> 37:01.900]  And I said, I know you're not a bath person,
[37:01.900 --> 37:03.620]  but this will make you feel better.
[37:03.620 --> 37:06.300]  And I dropped her off some eucalyptus mint once.
[37:06.300 --> 37:07.460]  She's hooked.
[37:07.460 --> 37:08.540]  They were wonderful.
[37:08.540 --> 37:10.380]  Did the effervescence clear out?
[37:10.380 --> 37:13.620]  The eucalyptus opened up everything.
[37:13.620 --> 37:15.660]  The CBDs had me relaxed.
[37:15.660 --> 37:18.340]  I was down with just my nose out.
[37:19.220 --> 37:22.140]  And then when the water got cold, I let some out.
[37:22.140 --> 37:23.900]  I ran all our hot water out.
[37:23.900 --> 37:26.780]  That's how long I just, oh, these are pretty nice.
[37:26.780 --> 37:29.420]  And I've done probably four of them since then.
[37:29.420 --> 37:30.260]  Very cool.
[37:30.260 --> 37:32.260]  I love watching the girls on Instagram and YouTube
[37:32.260 --> 37:33.340]  drop the bath bomb in there.
[37:33.340 --> 37:34.180]  And it starts to fizz out.
[37:34.180 --> 37:35.020]  Do you take a bath bomb?
[37:35.020 --> 37:36.340]  I don't really do baths.
[37:36.340 --> 37:37.500]  I'm six foot five.
[37:37.500 --> 37:38.780]  So getting in and out of the bath
[37:38.780 --> 37:40.620]  is more painful than it's worth.
[37:40.620 --> 37:41.740]  Are your legs up on the tub?
[37:41.740 --> 37:42.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:42.580 --> 37:44.380]  You can't get all your body parts
[37:44.380 --> 37:45.660]  in the tub at the same time.
[37:45.660 --> 37:46.900]  I get parts of me.
[37:46.900 --> 37:49.100]  Yeah, you would need a hot tub size one.
[37:49.100 --> 37:50.700]  Oh, I've gone to some hotels
[37:50.700 --> 37:52.620]  just because I know they have big hot tubs
[37:52.620 --> 37:53.460]  or big bath tubs.
[37:53.460 --> 37:54.660]  That's why they get me at some places.
[37:54.660 --> 37:56.260]  All you gonjapreneurs out there,
[37:56.260 --> 38:00.700]  what we need is a CBD showerhead.
[38:00.700 --> 38:01.540]  Right?
[38:02.740 --> 38:03.700]  Wow.
[38:03.700 --> 38:06.740]  An isolation tank filled with CBD water.
[38:06.740 --> 38:09.500]  Oh yeah, they make that CBD water.
[38:09.500 --> 38:10.700]  You fill it, yeah.
[38:10.700 --> 38:12.660]  Ooh, put a bath bomb in the float tank.
[38:14.740 --> 38:15.740]  What would that do?
[38:15.780 --> 38:16.940]  So yeah, in the bath bombs,
[38:16.940 --> 38:19.740]  there's all kinds of beneficial other things in there,
[38:19.740 --> 38:21.340]  including the THC and CBD,
[38:21.340 --> 38:22.900]  but there's Epsom salts in them
[38:22.900 --> 38:26.220]  and essential oils and a few other things
[38:26.220 --> 38:29.020]  that bind it together and make it pretty.
[38:29.020 --> 38:30.260]  So, and make it foam.
[38:30.260 --> 38:32.780]  How much of the cannabinoids does your skin develop
[38:32.780 --> 38:34.180]  or de-develop?
[38:34.180 --> 38:35.020]  That's not the word I wanted,
[38:35.020 --> 38:35.940]  but I think you know what I meant.
[38:35.940 --> 38:37.580]  Yeah, incorporate, like soak in.
[38:37.580 --> 38:38.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:38.420 --> 38:39.260]  Absorb.
[38:39.260 --> 38:41.700]  Absorb, thank you.
[38:41.700 --> 38:42.540]  I ruined everybody.
[38:42.540 --> 38:43.380]  Nobody could find it.
[38:43.380 --> 38:44.460]  Granny had to help us out.
[38:44.460 --> 38:45.540]  I know, thank you.
[38:46.340 --> 38:47.180]  Shannon got it first.
[38:47.180 --> 38:48.700]  No, actually you did.
[38:48.700 --> 38:50.260]  But all our lower legs don't.
[38:50.260 --> 38:53.500]  I honestly don't have a,
[38:53.500 --> 38:55.620]  there's no science that has,
[38:55.620 --> 38:58.380]  I could quote that I would feel comfortable saying
[38:58.380 --> 38:59.900]  it's this kind of percentage.
[39:00.860 --> 39:02.860]  It just, from everything,
[39:02.860 --> 39:04.780]  I mean, your skin is your largest organ.
[39:04.780 --> 39:07.820]  So it's obviously when you get in a tub of hot water,
[39:07.820 --> 39:08.660]  it's absorbing.
[39:08.660 --> 39:10.140]  And we know Epsom salts in those.
[39:10.140 --> 39:13.900]  So it's just collecting on and absorbing into your skin.
[39:14.780 --> 39:17.220]  People, the effects that they've had is,
[39:17.220 --> 39:19.820]  they say that it's the best night's sleep they've ever had.
[39:19.820 --> 39:20.660]  Oh, nice.
[39:20.660 --> 39:23.100]  Or, you know, I had pulled my back
[39:23.100 --> 39:25.860]  and I took a bath and the next morning,
[39:25.860 --> 39:26.980]  well, they might still be sore.
[39:26.980 --> 39:29.740]  They were able to at least function
[39:29.740 --> 39:31.980]  or get to work still or get to the doctor
[39:31.980 --> 39:33.860]  without having to call a friend.
[39:34.900 --> 39:39.300]  So, you know, I believe in my opinion
[39:39.300 --> 39:41.420]  that it helps people with,
[39:41.420 --> 39:43.100]  especially out here in Colorado,
[39:43.340 --> 39:46.340]  dry skin, psoriasis, things like that,
[39:46.340 --> 39:49.980]  that, you know, are topical issues.
[39:49.980 --> 39:51.060]  Just like any topical,
[39:51.060 --> 39:52.420]  it's being absorbed through your skin.
[39:52.420 --> 39:53.260]  So those tabby noises.
[39:53.260 --> 39:54.580]  They do hydrate your skin.
[39:54.580 --> 39:57.020]  You feel very soft when you get out of the tub.
[39:57.020 --> 39:58.940]  Yeah, there's oils in there, essential,
[39:58.940 --> 40:01.300]  like not just essential oils as far as scents,
[40:01.300 --> 40:06.300]  but there's like MCT oil and coconut oils and almond oils.
[40:06.740 --> 40:07.980]  Actually, there's not coconut.
[40:07.980 --> 40:09.860]  There is sweet almond oils sometimes used
[40:09.860 --> 40:12.620]  and depending on which flavors and or scents.
[40:13.180 --> 40:14.220]  I always say flavors.
[40:14.220 --> 40:17.140]  So, but so all those things,
[40:17.140 --> 40:19.100]  like they're all made just a little bit different
[40:19.100 --> 40:22.900]  and specifically, but so yeah, I mean,
[40:22.900 --> 40:26.740]  it's just those oils carry the cabin noise into the skin.
[40:26.740 --> 40:27.900]  So there's definitely an absorption,
[40:27.900 --> 40:30.140]  but to give you an exact quote on a percentage,
[40:30.140 --> 40:32.100]  I have no scientific facts.
[40:32.100 --> 40:33.580]  Do you think just personally,
[40:33.580 --> 40:35.500]  do you think somebody that did not smoke
[40:35.500 --> 40:36.700]  or consume edibles or anything,
[40:36.700 --> 40:39.380]  would they pass a drug test from using a bath bomb?
[40:40.380 --> 40:41.220]  I don't know,
[40:41.220 --> 40:43.740]  I would probably find a candidate to test.
[40:43.740 --> 40:45.180]  Do you know somebody that doesn't smoke
[40:45.180 --> 40:46.940]  that you wanna drop a bath bomb on?
[40:48.220 --> 40:49.060]  We could talk about that.
[40:49.060 --> 40:50.580]  Yeah, I actually,
[40:50.580 --> 40:51.740]  We'll find out what that does.
[40:51.740 --> 40:53.220]  I have some curious friends
[40:53.220 --> 40:56.140]  that are not cannabis consumers that,
[40:56.140 --> 40:58.500]  because again, there's no high to it.
[40:58.500 --> 40:59.340]  Right.
[40:59.340 --> 41:00.180]  You're not actually processing.
[41:00.180 --> 41:03.380]  Is there any THC in it at all from the CBD
[41:03.380 --> 41:06.420]  that your skin will absorb?
[41:06.420 --> 41:07.260]  Well, yeah, I mean that-
[41:07.260 --> 41:09.260]  You want them to try a THC one to see if they can-
[41:09.260 --> 41:10.100]  Right.
[41:10.100 --> 41:11.300]  To see if it gets in through the skin.
[41:11.300 --> 41:13.580]  To see, so we need somebody who doesn't consume,
[41:13.580 --> 41:16.980]  which so that might be a test that we need to try just to-
[41:16.980 --> 41:17.820]  I'm just curious.
[41:17.820 --> 41:18.660]  Yeah, because I mean,
[41:18.660 --> 41:19.940]  you can buy a test at the grocery store and-
[41:19.940 --> 41:20.780]  Right.
[41:20.780 --> 41:21.620]  Test them.
[41:21.620 --> 41:23.620]  Yeah, just a little dip pee test.
[41:23.620 --> 41:25.060]  Yeah, because that would be-
[41:25.060 --> 41:27.860]  I don't know anybody that doesn't smoke.
[41:27.860 --> 41:28.700]  I'm trying to think,
[41:28.700 --> 41:29.860]  I do know somebody,
[41:29.860 --> 41:31.740]  but I don't know if they would be down for it.
[41:31.740 --> 41:33.540]  I know one person that would be down for it,
[41:33.540 --> 41:34.380]  but I don't-
[41:35.260 --> 41:37.460]  We'll find a test subject sometime soon
[41:37.460 --> 41:38.500]  and I'll report back.
[41:38.500 --> 41:39.340]  There you go.
[41:39.700 --> 41:40.540]  If you can't find one,
[41:40.540 --> 41:41.380]  let me know,
[41:41.380 --> 41:42.220]  because I know one for sure that I can make.
[41:42.220 --> 41:43.300]  We'll make it a project.
[41:43.300 --> 41:44.140]  I'm very curious,
[41:44.140 --> 41:45.420]  because you said the skin's largest organ.
[41:45.420 --> 41:47.220]  If our lungs take in so much,
[41:47.220 --> 41:48.540]  how much can our skin absorb?
[41:48.540 --> 41:49.380]  Right.
[41:49.380 --> 41:50.220]  We have to.
[41:50.220 --> 41:51.060]  Yeah, right.
[41:51.060 --> 41:51.900]  Hopefully.
[41:51.900 --> 41:52.860]  Hopefully.
[41:52.860 --> 41:54.020]  We're all just going to be slathered
[41:54.020 --> 41:55.660]  in up with THC creams pretty soon.
[41:55.660 --> 41:57.100]  I mean, because otherwise,
[41:57.100 --> 41:57.940]  to all topicals,
[41:57.940 --> 41:58.780]  I mean, they wouldn't work
[41:58.780 --> 42:00.420]  if our skin wasn't absorbing.
[42:00.420 --> 42:01.820]  Right, any arnica gel,
[42:01.820 --> 42:02.660]  anything like that would work.
[42:02.660 --> 42:04.900]  And all those products are excellent sources
[42:04.900 --> 42:05.740]  of pain relief,
[42:05.740 --> 42:07.340]  especially in specific areas.
[42:07.340 --> 42:08.780]  Okay.
[42:08.780 --> 42:10.220]  Do you have a topical,
[42:10.220 --> 42:11.500]  a sap?
[42:11.500 --> 42:13.420]  No, that's out there.
[42:13.420 --> 42:15.700]  I'm not trying to recreate the wheel
[42:15.700 --> 42:17.100]  with this company.
[42:17.100 --> 42:20.580]  Our goal is to find new inventive ways
[42:20.580 --> 42:23.620]  and connoisseur grade type products.
[42:23.620 --> 42:26.580]  But we're not that much more expensive
[42:26.580 --> 42:29.180]  than the big guys that are doing BHO.
[42:29.180 --> 42:30.580]  But so for a few dollars more,
[42:30.580 --> 42:33.140]  you can have something that's completely clean
[42:33.140 --> 42:34.540]  if that's your choice.
[42:34.540 --> 42:36.340]  I personally have smoked BHO.
[42:36.340 --> 42:37.500]  I'm not going to be a snob.
[42:37.820 --> 42:38.660]  We have some here on the table.
[42:38.660 --> 42:40.140]  I mean, it's right here on the table.
[42:40.140 --> 42:41.260]  Yeah, there's plenty here tonight.
[42:41.260 --> 42:43.460]  I'm not sick and I don't have cancer.
[42:43.460 --> 42:45.020]  So I can't make that decision
[42:45.020 --> 42:46.100]  for somebody who might have
[42:46.100 --> 42:47.660]  a more serious condition.
[42:47.660 --> 42:49.620]  For me, it doesn't affect me.
[42:49.620 --> 42:51.860]  So I'm willing to take that risk.
[42:51.860 --> 42:53.460]  Somebody else might not want
[42:53.460 --> 42:54.660]  to have to take that risk.
[42:54.660 --> 42:58.260]  So we want to offer those people a solution.
[42:58.260 --> 43:00.460]  So, sorry, I got off point.
[43:00.460 --> 43:01.660]  No, you're going beautifully.
[43:01.660 --> 43:02.500]  Keep going.
[43:03.740 --> 43:04.900]  Oh, so topicals.
[43:04.900 --> 43:05.780]  So like I said,
[43:05.780 --> 43:07.100]  I'm not trying to recreate it.
[43:07.740 --> 43:08.580]  I do have a topical
[43:08.580 --> 43:10.540]  that I'm wanting to bring out.
[43:10.540 --> 43:12.100]  I'm trying to go, like I said,
[43:12.100 --> 43:13.020]  connoisseur grade,
[43:13.020 --> 43:15.300]  and I'm looking at bringing out a body butter.
[43:15.300 --> 43:16.140]  Cool.
[43:16.140 --> 43:17.460]  You know, dry skin again.
[43:17.460 --> 43:19.540]  A big effect out here in the summer,
[43:19.540 --> 43:21.900]  it's sunburns and, you know,
[43:21.900 --> 43:23.900]  there's already the topicals in the salves.
[43:23.900 --> 43:24.740]  This will be something
[43:24.740 --> 43:26.740]  that not only nourishes your skin,
[43:26.740 --> 43:28.380]  smells amazing.
[43:28.380 --> 43:31.660]  You know, it's that connoisseur grade body,
[43:31.660 --> 43:32.980]  mall body product.
[43:32.980 --> 43:34.980]  So you can go to the mall,
[43:34.980 --> 43:37.220]  pay the same amount of money,
[43:37.220 --> 43:38.860]  or you can pay the same amount of money
[43:38.860 --> 43:40.300]  and you can get it with cannabis in it.
[43:40.300 --> 43:43.500]  And it's still equally has all those effects,
[43:43.500 --> 43:45.740]  but you will get additional effects
[43:45.740 --> 43:47.140]  if you have a need for that.
[43:47.140 --> 43:47.980]  That's awesome.
[43:47.980 --> 43:49.260]  You can smell like strawberries and watermelons.
[43:49.260 --> 43:51.100]  And have THC all at the same time.
[43:51.100 --> 43:51.940]  That's excellent.
[43:51.940 --> 43:52.780]  I like that.
[43:52.780 --> 43:54.620]  So that's one of the things that I'm working on.
[43:54.620 --> 43:55.820]  What type of price point
[43:55.820 --> 43:57.180]  do the suppositories go for?
[43:57.180 --> 43:59.100]  If somebody wants to think about doing this,
[43:59.100 --> 44:00.180]  I know you're not the dispensary.
[44:00.180 --> 44:01.620]  I know you're the distributor and the maker,
[44:01.620 --> 44:03.380]  so you don't set the price, but.
[44:03.780 --> 44:06.060]  The retail price runs, I want to say,
[44:06.060 --> 44:07.660]  right around $16.
[44:07.660 --> 44:09.060]  Oh, that's very affordable.
[44:09.060 --> 44:10.740]  Especially for 50-50 milligram.
[44:10.740 --> 44:11.740]  Okay, yeah.
[44:11.740 --> 44:13.340]  For 12 hours of Medicaid.
[44:13.340 --> 44:14.500]  Right.
[44:14.500 --> 44:15.340]  Yeah, exactly.
[44:15.340 --> 44:17.580]  And it's all about what kind of,
[44:17.580 --> 44:19.380]  what do you need the medicine for?
[44:19.380 --> 44:20.220]  Like, you know,
[44:20.220 --> 44:21.620]  for somebody who doesn't have pain,
[44:21.620 --> 44:23.340]  buying a topical is, you know,
[44:23.340 --> 44:25.820]  doesn't have sore muscles or a joint ache,
[44:25.820 --> 44:28.100]  why would you buy a topical that's a salve?
[44:28.100 --> 44:29.860]  So it's all about application
[44:29.860 --> 44:31.260]  and what you need it for,
[44:31.260 --> 44:32.820]  in my personal opinion,
[44:32.860 --> 44:35.380]  is where you're willing to spend your money.
[44:35.380 --> 44:38.020]  Do you know of dispensaries in the Colorado Springs,
[44:38.020 --> 44:39.740]  Denver area, where people can grab these?
[44:39.740 --> 44:40.980]  Absolutely.
[44:40.980 --> 44:42.860]  We have a list of dispensaries.
[44:42.860 --> 44:43.700]  Yeah, I like it.
[44:43.700 --> 44:44.900]  People become prepared.
[44:44.900 --> 44:45.820]  Oh yeah.
[44:45.820 --> 44:47.860]  I'm prepared, but not overly prepared.
[44:47.860 --> 44:49.820]  So give me two seconds to pull that.
[44:49.820 --> 44:50.660]  Perfect for this show.
[44:50.660 --> 44:52.380]  But I will say,
[44:52.380 --> 44:55.220]  we're going to shout out one of our favorite dispensaries,
[44:55.220 --> 44:56.140]  Epic Remedy.
[44:56.140 --> 44:57.140]  Oh yeah, for sure.
[44:57.140 --> 44:58.860]  I actually just swung through there
[44:58.860 --> 45:00.940]  right before we did the podcast
[45:00.940 --> 45:04.020]  and I picked up a whole bunch of dabble products from them.
[45:04.020 --> 45:05.860]  We grabbed, it was so funny.
[45:05.860 --> 45:08.220]  We went in there earlier this morning
[45:08.220 --> 45:11.060]  and we walked in and a shout out to Dusty in there
[45:11.060 --> 45:14.820]  because Dusty was like, drop happening later, come back.
[45:14.820 --> 45:15.660]  And I was like, cool.
[45:15.660 --> 45:17.380]  So I just picked up a syringe
[45:17.380 --> 45:19.900]  and I think I grabbed like a, oh,
[45:19.900 --> 45:22.460]  I grabbed a New York City Diesel shadow from them.
[45:22.460 --> 45:25.860]  It looked like, it looked pretty good in the container,
[45:25.860 --> 45:27.220]  which is why I scooped it.
[45:27.220 --> 45:29.340]  But man, when you open it,
[45:29.860 --> 45:31.380]  that's it right there.
[45:31.380 --> 45:34.260]  It looked, honestly, like I would compare it
[45:34.260 --> 45:36.220]  to a very well known.
[45:36.220 --> 45:37.980]  And this is dabble?
[45:37.980 --> 45:39.500]  No, yes.
[45:39.500 --> 45:41.300]  No, this is craft actually.
[45:41.300 --> 45:42.140]  And I would compare that to a-
[45:42.140 --> 45:45.380]  Oh, that looks like that one real expensive extract.
[45:45.380 --> 45:46.660]  And that's what I was just going to say to you.
[45:46.660 --> 45:47.740]  So I'm going to pass this around
[45:47.740 --> 45:49.940]  so everybody can try this.
[45:49.940 --> 45:52.180]  Yes, that's exactly what I was going to say.
[45:52.180 --> 45:53.700]  That's the first thing I said when it came out.
[45:53.700 --> 45:56.300]  I said, oh, and it tastes so good.
[45:56.300 --> 45:57.740]  Yeah, they carry a lot of great concentrates.
[45:57.980 --> 45:59.980]  So yes, big shout out to Epic Remedy.
[45:59.980 --> 46:02.540]  Dusty and everybody in there always hooks us up.
[46:02.540 --> 46:03.820]  Big shout out to them.
[46:03.820 --> 46:04.820]  I've been dabbing these.
[46:04.820 --> 46:08.060]  And their prices are very, very reasonable.
[46:08.060 --> 46:08.900]  Those are amazing too.
[46:08.900 --> 46:10.900]  They have a deal going every day.
[46:10.900 --> 46:14.420]  Another product that we are shortly coming out with,
[46:14.420 --> 46:15.700]  we've got a solvent-less edibles,
[46:15.700 --> 46:18.780]  but we're also, the pen market is huge.
[46:18.780 --> 46:20.740]  The, you know, the vape pens.
[46:20.740 --> 46:23.900]  So we're going to have a solvent-less pen out soon.
[46:23.900 --> 46:24.740]  That'll be cool.
[46:24.740 --> 46:27.340]  That, you know, will be available in our areas.
[46:27.940 --> 46:28.940]  So you wanted to know where we are.
[46:28.940 --> 46:29.780]  Yes, ma'am.
[46:29.780 --> 46:31.100]  In the Springs area.
[46:31.100 --> 46:33.100]  And again, so what I want to disclose
[46:33.100 --> 46:34.180]  before I give you this list
[46:34.180 --> 46:36.140]  is not everybody carries all of our products.
[46:36.140 --> 46:37.340]  So you're going to want to contact,
[46:37.340 --> 46:39.020]  if that's your suspensory and ask them,
[46:39.020 --> 46:42.100]  hey, do you have their rosin or their suppositories?
[46:42.100 --> 46:44.340]  Because some of them carry some of it,
[46:44.340 --> 46:46.300]  but not all of our products.
[46:46.300 --> 46:48.020]  And by the time this comes out, that may have changed.
[46:48.020 --> 46:48.860]  This will be out Monday.
[46:48.860 --> 46:49.900]  So you got a couple of days.
[46:49.900 --> 46:50.740]  Right.
[46:50.740 --> 46:52.540]  So AIM Wellness here in the Colorado,
[46:52.540 --> 46:55.380]  or in the Springs area, the 64 store,
[46:55.380 --> 47:00.380]  Cannabicare, Tweedleaf, and Grant Farms.
[47:01.780 --> 47:03.820]  Stained Glass is a huge supporter.
[47:03.820 --> 47:05.740]  I really like working with them.
[47:05.740 --> 47:09.280]  Mindful, Elevations, obviously Epic Remedy,
[47:09.280 --> 47:12.300]  we already talked about, Enlightened Care,
[47:12.300 --> 47:16.940]  and I think that's Green Meds, is it?
[47:16.940 --> 47:18.100]  Just the Green Cross.
[47:18.100 --> 47:19.420]  I don't remember what.
[47:19.420 --> 47:20.340]  I think it is Green Meds.
[47:20.340 --> 47:21.180]  Green Meds.
[47:21.180 --> 47:23.560]  And then we do have one partner
[47:23.560 --> 47:25.220]  that we're working with up in Fort Collins,
[47:26.060 --> 47:28.020]  and they are just doing amazing things up there,
[47:28.020 --> 47:30.420]  and that's Natural Alternatives.
[47:30.420 --> 47:32.820]  In the Denver area, we've got Live Green,
[47:32.820 --> 47:36.680]  which is Patients Choice on Colfax.
[47:37.740 --> 47:39.740]  Affinity is on Colfax.
[47:39.740 --> 47:42.980]  Be Good carries our stuff up in North Glen.
[47:43.940 --> 47:47.500]  Greenfields is another one, and their sister store,
[47:49.220 --> 47:50.880]  oh gosh, what is it, Green.
[47:53.220 --> 47:54.220]  Anyway, they have two stores.
[47:54.260 --> 47:56.260]  There's one in Denver and one up North.
[47:56.260 --> 47:58.700]  People in other states are probably punching something,
[47:58.700 --> 48:01.340]  going, they have all these places to go buy weed.
[48:01.340 --> 48:02.180]  Right?
[48:02.180 --> 48:04.540]  What's a bus that's just in the Springs?
[48:04.540 --> 48:06.940]  Little Brown House in Denver,
[48:06.940 --> 48:10.460]  Lotus Medical has us downtown,
[48:10.460 --> 48:14.500]  Lush, Standing Akimbo, The Giving Tree,
[48:14.500 --> 48:16.420]  and Kind Love is currently.
[48:16.420 --> 48:17.260]  Kind Love.
[48:17.260 --> 48:19.220]  Ooh, I like Kind Love.
[48:19.220 --> 48:20.380]  It's one of my favorite dispensaries.
[48:20.380 --> 48:21.300]  They don't pay me to say that.
[48:21.300 --> 48:22.760]  Nobody's endorsed me to do that.
[48:22.760 --> 48:23.900]  I love the way they're set up.
[48:24.580 --> 48:25.420]  I love the way they handle business.
[48:25.420 --> 48:26.340]  I like the people.
[48:26.340 --> 48:28.780]  Yep, everything, the grow, the medicine, the people,
[48:28.780 --> 48:29.900]  the quality, the products.
[48:29.900 --> 48:30.740]  Kind Love is a nice dispensary.
[48:30.740 --> 48:32.420]  And they carry suppositories there.
[48:32.420 --> 48:33.820]  Yes, they have suppositories.
[48:33.820 --> 48:36.580]  Bath bombs right now is what they're carrying with us.
[48:36.580 --> 48:38.380]  And sometimes they've got the best clones
[48:38.380 --> 48:40.380]  I've ever seen available in a dispensary.
[48:40.380 --> 48:41.220]  Really?
[48:41.220 --> 48:42.060]  At Kind Love, yeah.
[48:42.060 --> 48:43.300]  We actually got some of our original clones
[48:43.300 --> 48:44.140]  for our grow from them.
[48:44.140 --> 48:45.860]  So yeah, we worked with them
[48:45.860 --> 48:47.900]  when we first were getting established back last year.
[48:47.900 --> 48:48.740]  Very neat.
[48:48.740 --> 48:51.540]  Shannon has been working hard on her grow for her company.
[48:51.540 --> 48:53.460]  They grow some Lemon Jeffrey at Kind Love.
[48:54.100 --> 48:55.820]  They do a really good job.
[48:55.820 --> 48:56.660]  Really good job.
[48:56.660 --> 48:58.820]  Yeah, we've got a great team.
[48:58.820 --> 49:00.020]  We're still a small company,
[49:00.020 --> 49:01.060]  but we've got a great team.
[49:01.060 --> 49:03.540]  Brent, our grower, does a great job in the back.
[49:03.540 --> 49:07.500]  Our two owners, majority owners,
[49:07.500 --> 49:09.620]  are really just doing a great job running the company.
[49:09.620 --> 49:12.380]  And I'm just happy to be part of all of it
[49:12.380 --> 49:16.140]  and be able to meet people like you guys.
[49:16.140 --> 49:16.980]  We're glad to have you on
[49:16.980 --> 49:18.460]  to teach people about suppositories.
[49:18.460 --> 49:19.600]  Do you have a Pueblo place
[49:19.600 --> 49:21.380]  where people could buy it by any chance?
[49:21.380 --> 49:22.620]  We do not yet.
[49:23.460 --> 49:25.580]  But please, if you're in the Pueblo area
[49:25.580 --> 49:27.340]  and you have a dispensary that wants our product,
[49:27.340 --> 49:28.260]  go in and ask for it.
[49:28.260 --> 49:30.380]  I will make it happen.
[49:30.380 --> 49:33.300]  But I need you guys to ask for our products
[49:33.300 --> 49:35.740]  and that will help me.
[49:35.740 --> 49:38.580]  Is it medical only or rec too?
[49:38.580 --> 49:42.100]  We just went rec not too long ago.
[49:42.100 --> 49:45.420]  But on the rec side, we're limited
[49:45.420 --> 49:48.300]  because our grow's not quite established yet
[49:48.300 --> 49:50.220]  on the rec side for that first harvest.
[49:50.220 --> 49:52.140]  So we're only working on ancillary products
[49:52.140 --> 49:55.060]  being bath bombs and suppositories can be made.
[49:55.060 --> 49:57.900]  So if anybody needs them on the rec side too,
[49:57.900 --> 50:01.460]  of course, I'm happy to fulfill those needs too.
[50:01.460 --> 50:03.220]  Start making the requests, you guys.
[50:03.220 --> 50:04.620]  Start asking your dispensary owners.
[50:04.620 --> 50:06.380]  If you go to the dispensary, they don't have it,
[50:06.380 --> 50:07.420]  ask for it.
[50:07.420 --> 50:11.340]  And on Traveling Stoner and Dabbing Granny,
[50:11.340 --> 50:15.420]  and I'm not popular, but on my Instagram as well,
[50:17.100 --> 50:19.300]  there is a list of all these dispensaries
[50:19.300 --> 50:22.620]  that you can find that they've shouted out for me
[50:22.620 --> 50:24.900]  and been so helpful to help promote for me.
[50:24.900 --> 50:25.740]  Excellent.
[50:25.740 --> 50:26.580]  Follow, I'm sure everybody-
[50:26.580 --> 50:28.500]  Shannon, you are one of the cool kids.
[50:28.500 --> 50:29.340]  You are definitely.
[50:29.340 --> 50:30.540]  Absolutely.
[50:30.540 --> 50:32.220]  Hey, I'm cool with not being the cool kid.
[50:32.220 --> 50:33.820]  I just like to hang out with y'all.
[50:33.820 --> 50:35.060]  Instagram doesn't make you famous.
[50:35.060 --> 50:35.900]  You're cool as shit.
[50:35.900 --> 50:37.260]  No, it doesn't.
[50:37.260 --> 50:39.620]  You brought great content, so we appreciate it.
[50:39.620 --> 50:41.500]  You guys, I know everyone's already following
[50:41.500 --> 50:42.900]  the Traveling Stoner and the Dabbing Granny,
[50:42.900 --> 50:44.140]  but if you're not, go follow them.
[50:44.140 --> 50:45.460]  Find those list of dispensaries.
[50:45.460 --> 50:47.500]  There are recreational dispensaries on the list.
[50:47.500 --> 50:49.260]  So if you're coming from out of state,
[50:50.100 --> 50:50.940]  if you're coming from another country,
[50:50.940 --> 50:52.820]  if you're 21 and over, you can get these products.
[50:52.820 --> 50:53.980]  You can take a bath.
[50:53.980 --> 50:56.020]  You can drop a bath bomb in there.
[50:56.020 --> 50:57.300]  You can get a suppository.
[50:57.300 --> 50:58.780]  You can put that where the sun don't shine.
[50:58.780 --> 51:00.540]  You can see what we're talking about.
[51:00.540 --> 51:02.020]  I endorse these products.
[51:02.020 --> 51:05.540]  If you need to tell your dispensary who to contact,
[51:05.540 --> 51:10.540]  my Instagram name is sserendipity93.
[51:12.460 --> 51:15.900]  It's, you know, it says that I'm the CGC manager on there,
[51:15.900 --> 51:17.060]  marketing manager and whatnot.
[51:17.060 --> 51:20.220]  So if they can DM me, they can Instagram me,
[51:20.220 --> 51:23.820]  they can call me directly, whatever they need.
[51:23.820 --> 51:26.620]  But yeah, I'm definitely accessible if they have questions.
[51:26.620 --> 51:27.460]  Get in touch.
[51:27.460 --> 51:28.540]  If you guys heard that hissing sound,
[51:28.540 --> 51:29.860]  that is not a deadly cobra.
[51:29.860 --> 51:32.300]  That is a can of butane refilling a torch
[51:32.300 --> 51:33.900]  because Bobo over here needs a dab.
[51:33.900 --> 51:36.540]  I think he just gave Lindsay a dab of death.
[51:36.540 --> 51:37.980]  I had to take a macro of it
[51:37.980 --> 51:39.340]  because he just gave me the most.
[51:39.340 --> 51:40.900]  Is it a turptail?
[51:40.900 --> 51:43.740]  He put a piece of shatter, then he dipped it in the CBD,
[51:43.740 --> 51:46.140]  and then he just coated it in distillate.
[51:46.180 --> 51:47.860]  And I'm like watching him and I'm like,
[51:47.860 --> 51:49.500]  is he gonna stop putting distillate on it?
[51:49.500 --> 51:50.940]  Is he gonna stop putting distillate?
[51:50.940 --> 51:52.620]  He's not gonna stop putting anything.
[51:52.620 --> 51:56.700]  It was the spider web, all the CBD I sent on there.
[51:56.700 --> 51:57.940]  It was falling off and I didn't want to follow up.
[51:57.940 --> 51:59.020]  You're missing the nail, brother man.
[51:59.020 --> 51:59.860]  There you go.
[51:59.860 --> 52:01.900]  He's trying to get on.
[52:01.900 --> 52:02.740]  Watch my dreads.
[52:02.740 --> 52:03.900]  He's eating nothing.
[52:03.900 --> 52:05.380]  Yeah, that's all I'm worried about.
[52:05.380 --> 52:06.860]  Three people in the room with dreads in.
[52:06.860 --> 52:09.020]  If you could see this table,
[52:09.020 --> 52:12.380]  I'm sitting here looking and I forget that
[52:12.380 --> 52:13.700]  this isn't the norm.
[52:13.700 --> 52:15.940]  Oh, if this was Texas, we'd all go to prison for life
[52:16.740 --> 52:17.580]  for what's on this table.
[52:17.580 --> 52:19.500]  We have probably, I don't know,
[52:19.500 --> 52:22.220]  probably 10 tubes of distillate out there.
[52:22.220 --> 52:26.420]  Yeah, there's two, four, six, seven, eight, nine.
[52:26.420 --> 52:28.660]  There are 10 tubes of distillate within my site.
[52:28.660 --> 52:29.500]  Yeah, there's two more over here.
[52:29.500 --> 52:31.300]  Probably another 10 containers of turps.
[52:31.300 --> 52:32.460]  Shatters.
[52:32.460 --> 52:33.300]  Shatter.
[52:33.300 --> 52:35.260]  There's two ounces of shatter in front of me.
[52:35.260 --> 52:38.740]  Yeah, we got all this solvent, all the water.
[52:38.740 --> 52:43.020]  Five, six, seven rigs on the table, an e-nail.
[52:44.100 --> 52:45.580]  And this is just how we roll.
[52:46.220 --> 52:47.060]  I can't get it out.
[52:47.060 --> 52:49.180]  This is how, here Shannon, stick it inside of here
[52:49.180 --> 52:50.020]  so it heats up.
[52:50.020 --> 52:52.620]  Here's unheated, unopened distillate.
[52:52.620 --> 52:53.460]  This is ridiculous.
[52:53.460 --> 52:56.140]  Yeah, most people would be mad at us for this.
[52:56.140 --> 52:58.660]  Yeah, what other states would we go to prison for?
[52:58.660 --> 53:00.260]  Kentucky, Texas.
[53:00.260 --> 53:01.100]  They'd come in the front door
[53:01.100 --> 53:02.940]  and just take us to jail forever.
[53:02.940 --> 53:03.780]  Florida.
[53:03.780 --> 53:04.620]  Florida, yeah.
[53:04.620 --> 53:05.460]  So, Granny, a minute ago,
[53:05.460 --> 53:07.700]  you started to hint to us.
[53:07.700 --> 53:09.060]  I can't even talk, I'm still so high.
[53:09.060 --> 53:10.380]  Shout out to the Debs.
[53:10.380 --> 53:11.460]  But anyway, I'm gonna get you talking
[53:11.460 --> 53:14.180]  about your Vegas trip and I'm gonna take a Deb.
[53:14.180 --> 53:18.220]  Who has invited you and the grumpy grandpa to Vegas?
[53:18.220 --> 53:21.060]  This is something I'm very excited about
[53:21.060 --> 53:24.500]  because anybody that follows me on social media
[53:26.220 --> 53:29.220]  knows that my husband is very sick,
[53:29.220 --> 53:30.060]  but he's getting better
[53:30.060 --> 53:32.340]  now that we got him off them damn opioids
[53:32.340 --> 53:34.140]  and he's on cannabis, he's much better.
[53:34.140 --> 53:36.500]  And he's come out of that zombified,
[53:36.500 --> 53:40.620]  pharmaceutical trance he was in.
[53:40.620 --> 53:43.580]  And Beta Glass Labs out of Philadelphia
[53:43.580 --> 53:47.140]  called me two weeks ago and said,
[53:47.140 --> 53:48.620]  Granny, you know what Champs is?
[53:48.620 --> 53:51.020]  And I said, I do, I kind of would like to go.
[53:51.020 --> 53:52.860]  And they said, well, we'll fly you
[53:52.860 --> 53:55.380]  and grumpy grandpa out there together.
[53:56.260 --> 53:57.740]  And I'm like, you're kidding me.
[53:57.740 --> 53:59.900]  And they said, nope, we'd like to have the both of you
[53:59.900 --> 54:02.700]  come out, we'll put you up in a hotel.
[54:02.700 --> 54:06.220]  And I said, well, I've got to talk it over with my husband.
[54:06.220 --> 54:08.460]  So I hung up and I asked Kevin
[54:08.460 --> 54:10.820]  and he said, I feel pretty good.
[54:10.820 --> 54:13.020]  Even if I have to stay in my hotel room,
[54:13.020 --> 54:15.420]  I think you and I can take a trip to Vegas.
[54:15.420 --> 54:16.380]  Nice.
[54:16.380 --> 54:17.220]  Very nice.
[54:17.220 --> 54:20.540]  So shout out to Beta Glass Labs
[54:20.540 --> 54:22.180]  for making this trip come true.
[54:22.180 --> 54:23.900]  You're gonna see some great glass.
[54:23.900 --> 54:24.820]  And what did you say?
[54:24.820 --> 54:26.660]  It's been like five years since you guys
[54:26.660 --> 54:28.340]  have taken any kind of vacation together?
[54:28.340 --> 54:29.860]  Yeah, because he's been so sick.
[54:29.860 --> 54:30.700]  This is amazing.
[54:30.700 --> 54:31.540]  What a great perfect trip.
[54:31.540 --> 54:33.060]  It's perfect timing.
[54:33.060 --> 54:34.940]  You've been blessed lately, Granny.
[54:34.940 --> 54:37.100]  I've had lots of good things come my way.
[54:37.140 --> 54:39.140]  I've been doing things correctly.
[54:39.140 --> 54:41.100]  I believe you reap what you sow.
[54:41.100 --> 54:42.980]  I'm not out there to make money.
[54:42.980 --> 54:46.140]  I'm out there to, well, I'm out to promote
[54:46.140 --> 54:49.260]  a lot of young artists that I see here in the Springs.
[54:49.260 --> 54:52.140]  I'm out to help educate about cannabis
[54:52.140 --> 54:54.660]  and I'm out to have fun while I do it.
[54:54.660 --> 54:57.220]  I think you were achieving all three of those goals.
[54:57.220 --> 54:59.700]  This year, things are coming to fruition though.
[54:59.700 --> 55:00.820]  And that's kind of cool.
[55:00.820 --> 55:03.300]  Like, okay guys, tonight here we sit.
[55:03.300 --> 55:05.940]  Like I said, we had all those products on the table.
[55:05.940 --> 55:10.820]  Something we didn't say, shout out to Clydeside Edibles
[55:10.820 --> 55:13.700]  from Glasgow, Scotland.
[55:13.700 --> 55:15.140]  All the way from Scotland.
[55:15.140 --> 55:19.100]  I got a care package yesterday of edibles
[55:19.100 --> 55:22.380]  and t-shirts from Glasgow, Scotland.
[55:22.380 --> 55:25.140]  Now I opened them up and everybody was like,
[55:25.140 --> 55:27.260]  ooh, I'll tell you what,
[55:27.260 --> 55:28.900]  their edibles are pretty darn good.
[55:28.900 --> 55:31.420]  That chocolate marshmallow thing looked amazing.
[55:31.420 --> 55:33.740]  It looked very dense, but man, it was amazing.
[55:33.780 --> 55:35.980]  It wasn't heavy, it was good.
[55:35.980 --> 55:38.060]  I'm just glad that it was only THC.
[55:38.060 --> 55:41.140]  We joked about some of this maybe having possible other.
[55:41.140 --> 55:42.820]  I've still got these little chocolate,
[55:42.820 --> 55:44.140]  not chocolate, these hard candies.
[55:44.140 --> 55:47.540]  They are pineapple chunks made with sour diesel cannabis.
[55:47.540 --> 55:51.860]  They're 50 milligrams per bag, 2.5 milligrams per cube.
[55:51.860 --> 55:56.020]  The cubes are small and they remind me of some mescaline
[55:56.020 --> 55:58.220]  I got on fish stool one time.
[55:58.220 --> 56:00.060]  So I was very apprehensive to eat these.
[56:00.060 --> 56:01.300]  I did not eat any.
[56:01.380 --> 56:03.740]  All of my friends that did eat them seemed to be okay.
[56:03.740 --> 56:04.580]  So I'm excited.
[56:04.580 --> 56:05.540]  And they taste amazing.
[56:05.540 --> 56:07.100]  They smell good, but they look,
[56:07.100 --> 56:09.900]  those little squares look very suspicious to me.
[56:09.900 --> 56:11.060]  But I mean-
[56:11.060 --> 56:12.180]  Nobody's hallucinating yet.
[56:12.180 --> 56:15.260]  Who would even think that you would be eating
[56:15.260 --> 56:17.220]  THC edibles from Scotland?
[56:17.220 --> 56:18.060]  From Scotland.
[56:18.060 --> 56:20.100]  And you know, I gotta say,
[56:20.100 --> 56:22.060]  they have really big balls in Scotland
[56:22.060 --> 56:24.620]  because not only did they ship this to her,
[56:24.620 --> 56:26.820]  but they had it labeled right in there.
[56:27.820 --> 56:29.060]  Sweets and t-shirts.
[56:29.060 --> 56:29.900]  And what did he say?
[56:29.900 --> 56:30.740]  What did he?
[56:31.180 --> 56:32.660]  So then I said to him,
[56:32.660 --> 56:36.340]  well, I want to know what does a Scotsman wear
[56:36.340 --> 56:37.460]  under his kilt?
[56:37.460 --> 56:40.500]  And he said, if they're a true Scotsman like me, nothing.
[56:40.500 --> 56:42.020]  It's balls in the wind.
[56:43.220 --> 56:44.700]  So these edibles were made by a dude
[56:44.700 --> 56:45.860]  not wearing any underwear?
[56:45.860 --> 56:48.300]  Oh God, I hope he wasn't scratching.
[56:48.300 --> 56:50.180]  He had a skirt on.
[56:50.180 --> 56:52.580]  Makes it easier to insert his suppository.
[56:53.820 --> 56:56.380]  We should probably send him back a care package.
[56:56.380 --> 56:59.140]  I am not messing with shipping anything to Scotland.
[56:59.140 --> 57:00.500]  We'll wait a few more years on that one.
[57:01.260 --> 57:02.100]  None of us said that either.
[57:02.100 --> 57:05.140]  So not only did I get something from Glasgow, Scotland,
[57:05.140 --> 57:08.860]  I'm going to shout out long bong official.
[57:08.860 --> 57:10.820]  Should I tell the whole story?
[57:10.820 --> 57:12.500]  It sounds like it.
[57:12.500 --> 57:13.860]  Now these guys have a,
[57:13.860 --> 57:15.540]  like it's like a six foot bong.
[57:15.540 --> 57:16.620]  If you're on Instagram.
[57:16.620 --> 57:18.260]  Oh yeah, you can tell the whole story too, if you'd like.
[57:18.260 --> 57:19.100]  Can I?
[57:19.100 --> 57:19.980]  Okay.
[57:19.980 --> 57:21.020]  If you're on Instagram,
[57:21.020 --> 57:24.380]  you will see this big six foot bong.
[57:24.380 --> 57:25.700]  And I will say,
[57:26.860 --> 57:29.100]  it looks kind of appealing.
[57:29.100 --> 57:30.820]  And it's metal and crystal.
[57:30.820 --> 57:32.260]  And it's called Stanley.
[57:32.260 --> 57:33.820]  Kind of like flat Stanley.
[57:33.820 --> 57:37.580]  It's supposed to travel around to different weed people.
[57:39.100 --> 57:41.900]  And I had messaged this company,
[57:41.900 --> 57:43.860]  not knowing anything about them saying,
[57:43.860 --> 57:46.580]  well, can Stanley come to my house to review?
[57:46.580 --> 57:48.820]  And they said, yes, he could.
[57:48.820 --> 57:50.460]  And then a couple months later, they said,
[57:50.460 --> 57:53.540]  granny, we can't secure Stanley.
[57:53.540 --> 57:56.060]  I said, what do you mean you can't secure Stanley?
[57:57.020 --> 57:59.020]  And they said, well, we'll get back to you.
[57:59.820 --> 58:01.980]  So a month ago, they say to me,
[58:01.980 --> 58:05.860]  granny, custom grow 420 has Stanley
[58:05.860 --> 58:07.380]  and he won't respond to us.
[58:07.380 --> 58:09.900]  He will not give Stanley back.
[58:09.900 --> 58:12.300]  So custom grow is holding Stanley hostage.
[58:12.300 --> 58:13.180]  He likes Stanley.
[58:13.180 --> 58:15.620]  He's not going to give Stanley back.
[58:15.620 --> 58:17.620]  Well, that probably is no big deal.
[58:17.620 --> 58:19.580]  If you're a company here in the United States,
[58:19.580 --> 58:22.780]  I just go find custom grow 420.
[58:22.780 --> 58:24.980]  These guys are in Slovakia,
[58:24.980 --> 58:28.540]  which is the former Czechoslovakia.
[58:28.540 --> 58:31.460]  So there's no chasing custom grow 420
[58:31.460 --> 58:33.180]  because they're there.
[58:33.180 --> 58:36.460]  I can't find custom grow 420,
[58:36.460 --> 58:39.220]  but I'll tell everybody this story.
[58:39.220 --> 58:41.660]  We can tell everybody that follows all of us on Twitter
[58:41.660 --> 58:43.020]  and that listen to this podcast
[58:43.020 --> 58:44.460]  to send a message to custom grow
[58:44.460 --> 58:46.020]  and be like return Stanley.
[58:47.020 --> 58:48.780]  So this company was so nice.
[58:48.780 --> 58:52.820]  They sent me their second bong,
[58:52.820 --> 58:55.780]  which is called T-O-T-E-O.
[58:55.780 --> 58:56.980]  It's very big.
[58:57.020 --> 59:01.100]  It is hand blown Czechoslovakian crystal,
[59:01.100 --> 59:03.020]  Bohemian crystal.
[59:03.020 --> 59:04.460]  How tall would you say it is?
[59:05.500 --> 59:06.340]  From the table?
[59:06.340 --> 59:08.580]  Oh, that's 24 inches tall?
[59:08.580 --> 59:10.580]  Probably easily, easily.
[59:10.580 --> 59:12.140]  Because if I stand up,
[59:13.260 --> 59:15.700]  the mouthpiece is right where I'm standing.
[59:15.700 --> 59:17.100]  And I'm pretty tall, Jeff.
[59:17.100 --> 59:18.340]  Yeah, you are a tall lady.
[59:18.340 --> 59:22.340]  So they sent me this bong and I really like it,
[59:22.340 --> 59:26.940]  but who's going to get a bong ship from Slovakia?
[59:27.900 --> 59:30.380]  Only dad and granny, only dad and granny.
[59:30.380 --> 59:32.300]  So go ahead.
[59:32.300 --> 59:33.660]  How does that thing hit?
[59:33.660 --> 59:35.860]  I get hella high off that.
[59:35.860 --> 59:37.860]  I've seen the video on Instagram.
[59:37.860 --> 59:38.780]  It's real bubbly.
[59:38.780 --> 59:40.940]  That perk is like.
[59:40.940 --> 59:43.260]  So it's, describe the shape of it for us.
[59:43.260 --> 59:44.100]  You told us how tall it was.
[59:44.100 --> 59:47.420]  It looks kind of like a big crystal liter,
[59:47.420 --> 59:50.220]  two liter bottle, three liter bottle.
[59:50.220 --> 59:53.260]  And then there's this metal perk
[59:53.260 --> 59:54.700]  and it's all done on a lathe.
[59:54.740 --> 59:56.620]  They have a video up where you can actually
[59:56.620 --> 59:57.940]  see them making it.
[59:57.940 --> 59:59.220]  Cause I know people are like,
[59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.820]  ooh, I don't want to smoke on a metal.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:03.060]  I'm an old hippie.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.860]  You smoked out of way worse.
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:05.700]  Yeah.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.540]  And guess what?
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.340]  I still use a Bic lighter.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.540]  Me too. Not amp.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.820]  Me too.
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.220]  Don't bring your hemp wick toward me.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.540]  I can't get my,
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.900]  you can't get your bowl hot enough to fill your lungs.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.620]  I gotta light the hemp wick with the lighter
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.100]  and then light my bowl with the hemp wick
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:19.940]  and then shake the hemp wick with the fruit cup.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.020]  Oh no, you have to have a candle going.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.140]  No, no.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.420]  That's too many damn things.
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:26.660]  You get a lighter and smoke a bowl.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:30.060]  So it's like a three liter bottle with this perk.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.340]  And then there's this great big tall piece
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:35.260]  that comes up off the top that you fill with ice.
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:39.700]  Gives hella rips, but it's not really practical.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:43.660]  I mean, it's heavy.
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.380]  So once you put it down somewhere, it should stay there.
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:47.220]  Ah, okay.
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.060]  It looks really heavy.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:48.900]  It's very heavy.
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:49.740]  It's crystal.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:50.580]  I didn't even.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.420]  It is crystal.
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.100]  It's not, and that crystal is thick.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:57.660]  So, I mean, I think it's kind of cool I got a bong from.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.780]  They shipped it to you from Slovakia?
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.620]  Yes.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.460]  That's awesome.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.260]  And then they thought I spoke Slovakian
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.900]  because I was trying to be nice.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:09.140]  And I Googled simple Slovakian phrases
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:12.860]  and I cut and paste and they replied with a paragraph.
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:15.660]  And I was like, oh no, I don't speak Slovakia.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.980]  I was just being polite, help.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:18.820]  Google translator blew up.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:20.020]  But they're very nice people.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.260]  They really are.
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.740]  So shout out to long bong official.
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.580]  Yes, big shout out.
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.540]  That bong is amazing.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.060]  I don't say bong very much anymore.
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:29.900]  So thinking about words.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:30.860]  I know because we all dab.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.380]  Yeah, yeah, bong.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.580]  I used to be the bong champ.
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.260]  I kind of like smoking out of it.
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.180]  I might have to clean my bong and go at it again.
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:38.940]  Actually, maybe the next time we say,
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.180]  I'll have to take it apart,
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.740]  but there's screws to take.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.580]  Some assembly is required.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.900]  I'll bring a can of can you.
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.660]  Well, I'll do a few bong rips.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:47.500]  Sounds fun.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.340]  Sounds fun.
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.260]  I'm in.
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.420]  Can I do a few more shout outs?
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:51.380]  Please do, please do.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.620]  Right now on my Instagram,
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.900]  I got a really nice giveaway going on
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:58.260]  with Freaky Smoke Shop here in the Springs.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.020]  I have a e-mail,
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.500]  a rig that Lindsay and I have been smoking out of.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.020]  I took a titanium pencil and I signed the bottom.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:10.860]  It says, peace, Deb and Granny 2017.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.620]  And there's a few other giveaways,
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.980]  a few other, what do you call them?
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.180]  Swag.
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.460]  Some more swag to give away.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.980]  God dang, I think I'm high.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.180]  I think we all might be medicated properly.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:26.380]  When I can't even think of simple words, it's bad.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.380]  Or is it?
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.940]  Anyway, so that is the giveaway.
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.140]  And then the one thing I want to say is,
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:36.660]  I reached 250,000 followers on Instagram.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.100]  I've surpassed that even now.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.740]  By the time this comes out, you'll be way past that.
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.020]  I'm at 252 or two.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.140]  But that just amazes me.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:51.140]  So I am going to be doing a hell of a appreciation giveaway.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:52.980]  One of the things that I know,
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.220]  Beta Glass Labs is gonna donate one of their rigs to me.
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.140]  Then somebody I absolutely adore here in the Springs,
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:03.700]  Poppy Glass, has already blown a piece
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.820]  to give me for the giveaway.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.420]  I bet I can get a few other nice little glass blowers
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.300]  here in the Springs to give us some nice things.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:15.300]  So just be keeping an eye out for my 250 giveaway.
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.900]  And then of course I've got to thank my sponsors,
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:23.580]  Dabato, OOZ 420, and I'm back to repping Megatoke.
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.500]  And I actually like smoke and concentrate out of it.
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:30.140]  Other than that, I'm done shouting out.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.020]  I want to give a shout out to Elevate.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.700]  Always Elevate Glass.
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:34.900]  Yeah.
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.380]  We all need Elevate Glass.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.100]  Big shout out to Becca and the whole crew of Red Elevate.
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.980]  The beautiful ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:41.820]  Yes.
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.260]  But they're all Elevate dolls.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.300]  Those dudes are dolls.
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:46.300]  I asked them, what do I call you?
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.140]  He said, I'm a doll.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:47.980]  Yeah.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:48.820]  What's up, turtle?
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.660]  There you go.
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:50.500]  Own it.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.340]  Yeah.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.260]  Hey, maybe we should shout out a few companies
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:54.900]  that we've been getting our CBD from.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.060]  Because some of these companies,
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.660]  even you people in states that aren't legal,
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.820]  you can order CBD.
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.620]  And so far they're still delivering.
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.580]  I can direct you to empirewellness.com.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:11.100]  I think anybody that sampled their CBD tonight
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.500]  or their terps. Super tasty.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.380]  Their terps are wonderful.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:15.380]  They're good people.
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.700]  They've helped me get medicine to patients.
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.980]  All Dank Distillate Dabs here in Colorado.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.700]  He is still shipping nationwide.
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.700]  Trinity Terpenes, they're still shipping nationwide.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.660]  And Fido Family, they're still shipping nationwide.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.500]  Allegedly.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.340]  Well, they're still shipping to dab and granny.
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.180]  There you go.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.940]  I believe even, oh, and
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.900]  and John Ramsey, what's his company?
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:47.300]  Infinite CBD, he's still shipping.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.260]  Oh yeah.
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.220]  I see those guys talking about it on Facebook
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.260]  and Instagram all the time.
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.660]  They want to get CBD out to everybody.
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.780]  Shout out to all the CBD warriors.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.100]  The one thing I will say is we've got a lot
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:00.140]  of great CBD manufacturers.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.340]  I don't know, extractors, whatever.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:04.700]  But then we also have a lot of bullshit.
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.900]  We have these CBD wars where they're all biting
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.900]  and scratching at each other.
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:11.580]  I won't deal with this.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.380]  I will not endorse just one company.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.580]  I will endorse them all.
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:18.500]  Because then they've got to be nice to all our followers.
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.540]  It happens in the seed game also.
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:23.060]  Oh, I'm sure Jeff, you can probably speak.
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.620]  Yeah, and the older I get, the more I'm like,
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.540]  well, this is stupid.
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.420]  We're all doing the same thing.
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.340]  Let's just chill out and be nice to each other and do this.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.220]  There's room for all of us.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.180]  There shouldn't be a competition.
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.700]  There's a consumer for every product that's made.
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:39.060]  There's enough of us patients and consumers out there
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.620]  that none of you are going to go out of business.
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.780]  Right, absolutely.
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.900]  I can smoke all of this hash on this table,
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.780]  guaranteed I need a provider for more.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:48.900]  Lindsay, you doubt me?
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.740]  Nope, I'm laughing because Bobo just tried
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:53.580]  to smell a glass syringe in the middle of it.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.100]  Does it have any smell, bro?
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:57.940]  No.
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.780]  No?
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:05:59.620]  No, no, no.
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.460]  All right.
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:01.500]  That's what I was just.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.980]  Have you tried that one yet?
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:03.820]  No.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:04.660]  Please do.
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.860]  I was just gonna ask you, whose is this?
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:06.700]  It's mine.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.020]  Whoa.
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:08.860]  Some of these companies
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:10.660]  and their packaging are just amazing.
[01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:18.010]  This package is, what else comes in a package this size?
[01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:19.370]  Like toothpaste almost.
[01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:20.210]  Yes.
[01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:23.490]  And the product that comes in it is,
[01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:27.010]  I'm trying to find something.
[01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:27.850]  What else is this?
[01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:28.770]  Nothing else is this size.
[01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:30.050]  Nothing else is this small.
[01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:32.770]  No, and then they have to put it in that plastic as well.
[01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:33.610]  Oh yeah, okay.
[01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:35.890]  So we have to put it in this box
[01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:37.210]  with everything printed on it.
[01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:38.490]  And then we put it in.
[01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:40.130]  This syringe is a little bigger.
[01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.330]  Oh, that's a bigger syringe.
[01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:42.650]  Okay, that's better.
[01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:43.770]  All right, that makes more sense.
[01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:46.410]  But still couldn't the labeling go on?
[01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:49.130]  Go on to here, but then it wouldn't be consumer friendly.
[01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.610]  So the packaging, oh my,
[01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:52.290]  so much packaging in Colorado, you guys.
[01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:53.930]  It's garbage is what I call it.
[01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:58.010]  This is all landfill material, unless you recycle.
[01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:01.050]  And I know a lot of people that should, that don't.
[01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:04.770]  My neighborhood doesn't support much recycling, so.
[01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:05.610]  And you know what?
[01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:08.410]  If your trash company isn't gonna help you,
[01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:09.530]  it's hard to recycle.
[01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:11.010]  Let's admit it.
[01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:12.690]  I know you compost, don't you?
[01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:14.570]  I do what I can, but I can't compost everything.
[01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:16.330]  I don't have enough space and some stuff stinks.
[01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:18.450]  It stinks and you don't want that in your home.
[01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:20.530]  Yes, yes, but you can't smell it, can you?
[01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:21.370]  Nope.
[01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.210]  But I'm doing all right.
[01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:23.210]  Nope, when you talked about,
[01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:25.530]  actually when you talked on one of your podcasts
[01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:27.810]  about some of the things and I was like,
[01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:30.050]  oh, his house smelled like a home, not like a.
[01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:32.410]  Excellent, nailing it, thank you.
[01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:35.130]  Because I've got my Bokashi bucket is right over there.
[01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:36.490]  I was just gonna say that.
[01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:37.330]  You can see the Bokashi bucket
[01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:39.450]  and sometimes that sucker can stink.
[01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:40.410]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:41.770]  But you don't smell it at all.
[01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:43.410]  Jeff's home is very pleasant.
[01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:45.330]  Oh, well, it looks like it's a dude's house.
[01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:47.090]  It could use a cleaning.
[01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:48.930]  But you have a pink bathroom.
[01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:50.330]  Back to the pink bathroom.
[01:07:50.330 --> 01:07:52.370]  I wanna give a shout out to all my triplet friends in here.
[01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:53.130]  Everybody's wearing their
[01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:55.810]  Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodie and looking super sexy.
[01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.370]  Big shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:07:57.370 --> 01:07:59.250]  Yes, I know I'm supposed to do an ad for Handmade Apparel.
[01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:00.770]  If you guys need some printing done.
[01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:02.170]  I might have to hit them up.
[01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:04.250]  Please do, please use me as a reference.
[01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:05.130]  I will.
[01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:06.250]  About both of us.
[01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.690]  If you need hoodies, T-shirts,
[01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:09.570]  if you need hat pins, if you need stickers,
[01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:10.650]  if you need some stuff printed
[01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:12.010]  and you want it to look sharp.
[01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:14.210]  How dope are the colors on those hoodies, you guys?
[01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:15.370]  They're vivid, they're bright, they look fresh.
[01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:16.730]  Have you guys washed yours?
[01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:18.170]  I have washed mine twice now.
[01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:19.010]  Me too.
[01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:20.370]  And they still look brand new.
[01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:21.370]  They actually look sweet.
[01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:23.730]  No cracks in the back or anything.
[01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:24.570]  No issues.
[01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:27.090]  But do you do, are you friendly to your hoodie?
[01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:28.650]  Do you turn it inside out?
[01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:29.490]  No, I didn't actually.
[01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:30.890]  You should turn it inside out when you wash it.
[01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:31.730]  It'll last even longer.
[01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:32.570]  I didn't know that.
[01:08:32.610 --> 01:08:34.170]  The stuff won't crack.
[01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:35.970]  Yeah, because then your logo's not beating
[01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:37.290]  on the parts of the washer.
[01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:38.530]  Okay, that makes sense.
[01:08:38.530 --> 01:08:40.730]  And the dryer's not heating up, you know, this part.
[01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:43.410]  The actual logo, yeah, and like making it stick together.
[01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:44.250]  Life hack.
[01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.090]  And it's not rubbing against it.
[01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:45.930]  Teaching people lessons.
[01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:48.810]  That's what happens when you're 60, not 25.
[01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:49.650]  Right?
[01:08:49.650 --> 01:08:50.770]  Hey, I'm getting up there, Granny.
[01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:52.890]  Yeah, you're starting to learn all them little things.
[01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:55.250]  This is one of the original iRegenetic shirts,
[01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:56.970]  the very first batch printed by Handmade.
[01:08:56.970 --> 01:09:00.490]  And it's probably, I'm gonna guess this is seven years old.
[01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:01.330]  Wow.
[01:09:01.330 --> 01:09:02.730]  It's now starting to kind of,
[01:09:02.730 --> 01:09:05.770]  starting at the edges to look weird, like it's crackling.
[01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:08.690]  But look at the shirt, it's like not even black anymore.
[01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:10.010]  It's all dingy.
[01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:11.170]  It's basically a work shirt.
[01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:13.330]  It's like one of your favorite concert T-shirts.
[01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:14.170]  Yes, yes.
[01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:17.250]  But I've got, I bought a lot of these shirts
[01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:20.010]  and I think most of the extra, extra larges went to me.
[01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:20.850]  I think.
[01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:24.210]  If there's a festival, excuse me for the cough, guys.
[01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:27.170]  If there's a festival, if there's an event,
[01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:28.010]  brand new iRegen shirt.
[01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:29.450]  Just gotta rock the brand new one.
[01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:31.090]  Then I try to set it aside, then I forget
[01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:32.690]  and I end up wearing it and I'm like,
[01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:33.530]  oh, there's another event.
[01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:36.290]  Brand new iRegen shirt, gotta do it again.
[01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:37.930]  You guys really should order one of your
[01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:38.970]  Grow From Your Heart.
[01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:39.970]  These are nice hoodies.
[01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:41.610]  These are really, and they're really warm.
[01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:42.450]  They're warm.
[01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:43.890]  I don't have a coat on tonight.
[01:09:43.890 --> 01:09:45.850]  I have a little camisole underneath it.
[01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:47.930]  Chris and I went camping for my birthday.
[01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:51.210]  We went January 2nd, we got in the car and we went camping.
[01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:52.130]  And it was snowing.
[01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.330]  It was snowing.
[01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:55.810]  It was 20 degrees that night.
[01:09:55.810 --> 01:10:00.810]  And I wore the Grow From Your Heart podcast sweatshirt
[01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:05.250]  all night with probably two layers underneath it
[01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:06.090]  and that was it.
[01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:07.850]  And I was so warm all night.
[01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:10.090]  I was not, I didn't have any issues.
[01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:11.250]  Super cozy hoodies.
[01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:13.290]  So that's a double advertisement right there, you guys.
[01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:14.850]  Shout out to our friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:15.690]  Check them out.
[01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:17.930]  Handmadeapparel.biz.
[01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:19.610]  And also if you need a hoodie,
[01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:21.650]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:22.970]  I'd love to put one of these hoodies in your hands.
[01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:24.090]  It looks sexy in it.
[01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:25.290]  It looks so good.
[01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:26.130]  All your friends will be like,
[01:10:26.130 --> 01:10:27.050]  what's that, Grow From Your Heart?
[01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:29.770]  And then you'll be like, yeah, it's a podcast, bro.
[01:10:29.770 --> 01:10:31.810]  We do, we tell everybody that when we go places.
[01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:34.370]  I've secretly gotten asked multiple times
[01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:35.370]  what this hoodie is.
[01:10:35.370 --> 01:10:36.210]  Yeah.
[01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:37.050]  On multiple occasions.
[01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:37.870]  That's pretty rad.
[01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:39.410]  Yeah, and we tell people.
[01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:40.250]  Thank you.
[01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:41.850]  But the back is the best
[01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:45.730]  because you got Rasta Jeff's cheesy face.
[01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:46.570]  It's so cheesy.
[01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:47.390]  Exactly.
[01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:48.230]  It is super cheesy.
[01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:49.810]  It just makes you smile.
[01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:50.650]  Yeah.
[01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:52.010]  Sometimes, you know, I have to go in the bathroom
[01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:53.490]  and just turn around and put my camera.
[01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:55.530]  There's Jeff.
[01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:56.370]  That's funny.
[01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:57.210]  That's awkward.
[01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:58.030]  I like it.
[01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:58.870]  I like it.
[01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:00.950]  It's a really friendly deal because of what it was.
[01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:02.150]  They're like, dude, we want to do this.
[01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:02.990]  We want to do this.
[01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.830]  And I was like, go for it.
[01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:06.070]  There's a lot of color in this.
[01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:07.550]  It's like nine colors.
[01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:08.390]  Yeah.
[01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:10.350]  So shout out to our friends at Handmade Apparel
[01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:11.750]  since we talked about all the other companies
[01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:12.950]  that we were supporting.
[01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:16.070]  Lindsey, don't you have a few new sponsors?
[01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:18.790]  Come on, let's hear it.
[01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:20.270]  Nothing you want to talk about right now.
[01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:22.430]  Yeah, well, I mean, I can let you guys know
[01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:24.230]  that my website will be up and running
[01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:25.070]  at the end of the month.
[01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:27.430]  So the blog portion of my website
[01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:29.470]  will at least be up and running at the end of the month.
[01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:30.390]  The end of which month?
[01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:31.230]  This month.
[01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:34.350]  I thought, didn't we hear that the last podcast?
[01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:35.670]  That's why I wanted to specify that.
[01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:37.790]  When was I here the last time?
[01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:38.630]  That's funny.
[01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:41.550]  It was before the food thing.
[01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:42.390]  That's funny.
[01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:44.190]  Well, I've actually been working really hard on it
[01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:45.710]  and it will be out at the end of this month
[01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:48.430]  because I have nothing else that I am working on right now.
[01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:49.950]  This is the only thing I've been working on.
[01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.430]  So it will definitely be out at the end of this month.
[01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:52.990]  The only reason I troll you is because I like the shirt.
[01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:53.830]  No, I know.
[01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:55.470]  But that's funny because I didn't realize
[01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:56.950]  I had said that at the end of the last one.
[01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:58.230]  That's funny.
[01:11:58.230 --> 01:11:59.070]  Chris is nodding yes.
[01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:00.030]  He saw me setting it up.
[01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.870]  I was setting it up.
[01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:02.550]  I was like that shit.
[01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:03.790]  Chris was like, oh, let me do it.
[01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:04.630]  Let me do it.
[01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:07.750]  So since granny reminded me and it was in my notes,
[01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:08.870]  I didn't even open my notebook
[01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:10.310]  because we had so much to talk about on the show.
[01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:11.270]  My notes stayed on the floor.
[01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:12.990]  It was all organic and natural.
[01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:14.470]  How was the food drive you guys?
[01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:15.910]  How did that go?
[01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:17.390]  Do you know, I actually,
[01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:19.030]  the day that they picked everything up,
[01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:21.310]  I was at my sister's wedding in Georgia.
[01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:25.350]  So shout out to granny and Sam and Bailey
[01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:26.470]  and everybody else that came out.
[01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:32.030]  Sam, Bailey and I, and then the people at the Marion house.
[01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:34.910]  But when we pulled up in that new hall
[01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:36.670]  and those people were on the dock
[01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:38.710]  and I opened it up and she went,
[01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:41.830]  and I got out of the truck and I came up and I said,
[01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:45.510]  I wasn't going to tell you until I got here,
[01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:47.790]  but this all came from the cannabis community.
[01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:52.310]  And she goes, where did you get all this food?
[01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:54.950]  And I said, all the food and there's toys in there.
[01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:56.390]  There's money in there.
[01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:58.350]  And it all came from dispensaries.
[01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:00.830]  I'm getting my hair is standing up.
[01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:02.470]  It made me so happy.
[01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:07.470]  And she was like, wow, you guys really made a difference.
[01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:10.990]  So we had a U-Haul truck from ceiling to floor,
[01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:15.790]  front to back that was full of food, toys.
[01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:19.510]  There was some brand new kids, hats, gloves,
[01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:21.950]  lots of new toys for the kids.
[01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:22.790]  Yes.
[01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:24.110]  And then when I spoke with the lady,
[01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:25.870]  I was so impressed with this program
[01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:28.830]  and it's all through the Marian house, Catholic charities.
[01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:30.550]  If you're not religious, I don't care.
[01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:33.790]  This is just a good fed and toys in kids hands.
[01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:36.710]  They had, do you know what I mean by gorilla shelves?
[01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:38.070]  Those metal shelves.
[01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:40.790]  They had several of those different categories
[01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:44.790]  and they have a lot of displaced families.
[01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:47.190]  They're trying to get back on track.
[01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:49.190]  The parents have to take parenting classes,
[01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:50.510]  which I think that's good.
[01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:52.590]  That's good because if you're young,
[01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:55.550]  I was young and dumb once too, you need help.
[01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:57.190]  And we get a lot of people coming here
[01:13:57.190 --> 01:13:58.950]  because of the cannabis community
[01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:00.830]  and they don't have a plan.
[01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:02.710]  They don't have a solid plan in place.
[01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:04.910]  And sometimes kids suffer.
[01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:07.990]  Anyway, these gorilla shelves have brand new toys.
[01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:10.110]  And if it's a kid's birthday, they get to come in
[01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:11.710]  and they get to pick a brand new toy.
[01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:12.750]  That's pretty awesome.
[01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:15.230]  They had so many brand new diapers.
[01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:18.110]  You can go down there and get, if you need diapers, people,
[01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:20.390]  you can go down to the Marian house and get diapers.
[01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:22.030]  There's no questions asked.
[01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:23.630]  Diapers are expensive.
[01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.190]  Mm-hmm.
[01:14:25.190 --> 01:14:28.910]  So I just felt, yes, we did make a big difference.
[01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:29.990]  Thank you for bringing that up
[01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:31.910]  because that seems like an eternity ago.
[01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:33.470]  It was a while ago, but thank you for doing it
[01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.430]  because of the smile on your face right now is priceless.
[01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:36.270]  Was it?
[01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:37.110]  Yeah, it was great.
[01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:38.990]  It made me really happy to know that we helped so many people.
[01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:41.070]  I can only imagine the looks on the little kids' faces
[01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:42.710]  when they, because they know, the little kids know,
[01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:44.030]  they're like, we're fucked, we ain't getting nothing.
[01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.950]  They know, they can see it.
[01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:46.110]  Their parents don't tell them, but they know,
[01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:47.870]  we live in a thing and we are getting stuff.
[01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:48.750]  It's not gonna be cool.
[01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.110]  And then they get a present and they're like, oh my God,
[01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:53.830]  I got a $5 dinosaur that made my day.
[01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:54.670]  Yep.
[01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:55.510]  Like this.
[01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:57.670]  And kids, you know, kids shouldn't have to be punished
[01:14:57.670 --> 01:14:59.990]  for decisions their parents make.
[01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:01.230]  Right, I agree.
[01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.070]  So thank you for doing that.
[01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:03.030]  And Lindsey, thank you.
[01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.870]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:04.710]  I know you weren't there on the day,
[01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:05.550]  but you had a lot to do with it.
[01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:07.430]  For sure, I wanna give a big shout out to Bailey too
[01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:08.470]  for being a part of it.
[01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.910]  And actually I put up that post tonight
[01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:12.710]  that we were doing the podcast and she commented on it.
[01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:14.790]  She's like, yes, I've been looking for the name of it.
[01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:16.430]  Like, yes.
[01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:18.310]  So big shout out to Bailey.
[01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:19.350]  Rocky Mountain Dabber.
[01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:20.190]  Yes.
[01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:21.510]  And I met her at the Halloween party.
[01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:22.350]  Yes.
[01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:23.630]  I wasn't super talkative at the Halloween party
[01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:24.470]  because I was in the Chewbacca costume.
[01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:25.310]  Because you were hot.
[01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:26.150]  Yes.
[01:15:26.150 --> 01:15:26.990]  And I kind of overheated myself.
[01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:29.350]  I was dehydrated and spinning around in circles
[01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:30.190]  for part of it.
[01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:32.430]  But yes, big shout out to Bailey
[01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:36.110]  because she got up and helped Granny and Sam
[01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:38.110]  without any questions asked on her day off.
[01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:39.230]  And it was cold that day.
[01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:41.550]  Yeah, and you know, she only,
[01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:44.790]  she's a bud tender at Rocky Mountain Medical
[01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.110]  over on Garden of the Gods.
[01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:48.990]  And you know, she probably only gets a couple days
[01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:51.270]  a week off and I'm sure she didn't have.
[01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:53.110]  Plus she has a debilitating.
[01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:55.430]  Yeah, she has a lot of medical conditions
[01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:57.590]  that, you know, make it hard for her
[01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:58.910]  to stay mobile sometimes.
[01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:00.190]  The last time they sent her home
[01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:01.830]  from the hospital with a walker.
[01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:02.670]  Yeah.
[01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:03.750]  And she's what, 20?
[01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:04.950]  She's about my age, yeah.
[01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:06.230]  She's a youngster, yeah.
[01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:07.990]  So big shout out to Bailey for, you know.
[01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.830]  We love you, Bailey.
[01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:09.870]  You're a trooper.
[01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:11.670]  Also big shout out to THC Samuel.
[01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:13.750]  Yes, for helping with that as well.
[01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:15.550]  Also just for being THC Samuel.
[01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:16.390]  Shout out to that.
[01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:17.830]  Sam has a lot to talk about.
[01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:19.590]  Sam was just out on the West Coast,
[01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:22.670]  started down in San Francisco with JD Mapleson.
[01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:24.990]  These are all heady glassblowers guys.
[01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:26.990]  Started down in San Francisco,
[01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:28.190]  worked his way up,
[01:16:28.190 --> 01:16:31.870]  spent the night with Darby Holmes and the Holmes family
[01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:34.750]  and ended his trip with Bob Snodgrass.
[01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:37.830]  85 year old legend in the glassblowing world.
[01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:38.870]  The legend.
[01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:40.910]  In the school bus.
[01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:41.750]  I mean it.
[01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:42.710]  That's pretty awesome.
[01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:45.590]  Sam has a lot to talk about from his last trip.
[01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:46.990]  We're gonna get Samuel on the show.
[01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:48.750]  And he's the perfect person for that.
[01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.670]  Like he just, I love him.
[01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:53.870]  Now, when I say these are heady glassblowers,
[01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:56.070]  I don't know if any of us sitting here
[01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.430]  can probably afford any of these pieces.
[01:16:59.510 --> 01:17:01.150]  And I love you, Sam.
[01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:03.990]  When Sam texted me that he was at Darby Holmes,
[01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:07.390]  and Sam and I have come to know the Holmes family.
[01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:10.830]  And he said, all I could afford was a carb cap.
[01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:12.910]  And the carb cap is beautiful.
[01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:14.270]  It's so gorgeous.
[01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:15.470]  But I'm telling you guys,
[01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:20.190]  that wasn't like a five, 10, 20, $30, 100, no.
[01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:22.630]  It's a beautiful dichro.
[01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:24.830]  It's peach, right?
[01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:25.670]  Yes.
[01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:26.510]  It's peach.
[01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:28.310]  And then it has these two green leaves on it.
[01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.750]  It is a gorgeous carb cap.
[01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:31.150]  And it's a directional flow.
[01:17:31.150 --> 01:17:34.790]  Like it is a truly solidly gorgeous piece.
[01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:36.870]  But these glassblowers.
[01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:39.470]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:41.590]  Some of them pieces are a house.
[01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.430]  I was gonna say,
[01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:43.990]  that's a car sitting on the shelf right there.
[01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.830]  Absolutely.
[01:17:45.670 --> 01:17:46.710]  Well, shout out to THC, Sam.
[01:17:46.710 --> 01:17:48.150]  We're gonna get him on the show.
[01:17:48.150 --> 01:17:51.350]  Sam and I both have been survivors of head injuries.
[01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:53.270]  And Sam, of course, has had a couple more than me.
[01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:55.270]  I've got one major one, and one when I was a youth.
[01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.150]  But we're gonna talk about head injuries,
[01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:58.630]  and we're gonna talk about heady glass.
[01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:59.510]  So we'll get Sam on the show.
[01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:00.910]  We're also gonna talk about the East Coast,
[01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:02.270]  because he's from the East Coast.
[01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:03.910]  We're gonna talk about that.
[01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:05.990]  I'm gonna ask him some weed questions about the East Coast,
[01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:07.110]  and see what he's got to say.
[01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:08.030]  So big shout out to Sam.
[01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:09.950]  Shout out to everybody that helped in the food drive.
[01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:12.790]  Shout out to every dispensary that allowed,
[01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:14.030]  excuse me, my throat's break, you guys.
[01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.870]  I apologize.
[01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:16.070]  I'll give you one good one.
[01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:19.030]  I should say that it wasn't just dispensaries
[01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:20.510]  that did this just before you started,
[01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:23.110]  because like, Hannah Canyon was a part of it.
[01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.190]  The Family Joint.
[01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:26.030]  The Family Joint was.
[01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:27.390]  The Lazy Lion.
[01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:28.230]  The Lazy Lion.
[01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:29.190]  The Dab Lounge.
[01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:31.670]  Elevate Glass.
[01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:32.710]  Yeah, Elevate.
[01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:33.990]  The Glass Grind.
[01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.830]  Yes.
[01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:39.110]  DBK, is that what it is?
[01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:41.110]  Mary and Dylan, is it?
[01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:42.230]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:44.310]  I have a whole list of them on my phone, to be honest.
[01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:47.630]  Everybody that let us have a drop off spot, a box,
[01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:50.430]  and everybody that brought stuff to the boxes.
[01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:51.270]  Yes.
[01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:52.110]  Yes.
[01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:52.950]  You know what?
[01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:53.790]  Huge shout out to all those folks.
[01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:54.630]  I'm gonna give a special shout out, though,
[01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:56.390]  to Epic Remedy again for this.
[01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:58.710]  Honest to God, this is what cemented
[01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:01.630]  my relationship with Epic Remedy.
[01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:04.230]  We had lots of people that took our boxes,
[01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:06.510]  but this is what Epic Remedy did.
[01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:10.990]  Epic Remedy didn't care how many cans of new food
[01:19:12.190 --> 01:19:13.590]  you brought in.
[01:19:13.630 --> 01:19:16.830]  They gave you a dollar per can off your product
[01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:17.670]  that you were buying.
[01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:18.510]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:19.430]  Yeah.
[01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:21.270]  And after a week, I was like,
[01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:24.230]  Renz, he's the owner, you're taking a hit.
[01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:26.630]  And he goes, I don't care, it's the holidays.
[01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:28.790]  We're giving back to the community.
[01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:31.910]  So shout out to Renz and Epic Remedy.
[01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:36.870]  And that dispensary was in the poorest neighborhood
[01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:38.430]  of all the dispensaries.
[01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:39.950]  That was over in Pikes Peak Park,
[01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:41.790]  over on Circle and Fountain.
[01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:43.830]  It is one of the poorest neighborhoods
[01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:45.390]  of any of the dispensaries,
[01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:47.390]  but they collected the most food.
[01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:50.830]  Yes, Gail had to go over there countless of times.
[01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:54.550]  Honestly, we ran the thing for about three weeks, right?
[01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:55.910]  I was there probably three-
[01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:56.750]  Twice a week.
[01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:57.910]  Two to three times a week,
[01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:59.470]  she was going over there and picking up
[01:19:59.470 --> 01:20:03.510]  not just a box full, pallets.
[01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:05.270]  She had to take the truck over there,
[01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:06.510]  and the entire truck was like,
[01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:08.070]  every time I would get pictures,
[01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:09.590]  and like, just got back from Epic Remedy.
[01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:12.510]  Shout out to 7th Floor,
[01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:13.990]  silver serve for Steve.
[01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:16.630]  Yes, for letting us with the warehouse space.
[01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:19.150]  We didn't really anticipate getting as much food.
[01:20:19.150 --> 01:20:20.630]  That much stuff, we were gonna hold it all
[01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:21.750]  at the glass grind.
[01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.670]  And so when Epic Remedy called me the first time,
[01:20:24.670 --> 01:20:25.990]  and I drive a Silverado,
[01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:29.110]  so the entire back of my truck was full of food,
[01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:31.030]  and I thought, what am I gonna do?
[01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:33.190]  Steve said, you can have my warehouse.
[01:20:33.190 --> 01:20:36.670]  So he let us store all the food out there for three weeks.
[01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:38.910]  Then when I did get to U-Haul,
[01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:41.590]  his whole crew loaded the truck up for me.
[01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:44.590]  So shout out to the entire 7th Floor Vapes crew,
[01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:46.510]  because they were phenomenal.
[01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:48.270]  What are we doing next?
[01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:49.790]  God, I don't know.
[01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:51.790]  Let's start working on another food drive or something.
[01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:52.630]  Yeah.
[01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:53.910]  Something to help the community.
[01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:56.190]  We'll definitely have to do something.
[01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:57.510]  We'll talk about it on the next episode
[01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:58.550]  when we bring Granny on again.
[01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:59.390]  There you go.
[01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:00.230]  Excellent.
[01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:01.070]  We'll brainstorm.
[01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:03.030]  Sam is coming up with lots of good ideas too.
[01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:04.550]  Yes, Sam's a thinker.
[01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:05.750]  He is a thinker.
[01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:07.030]  That kid's head never stops.
[01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.230]  He's like me.
[01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:09.710]  Just brain keeps just spinning.
[01:21:09.710 --> 01:21:11.430]  You guys check out THC Magazine.
[01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:15.270]  The finest cover on a magazine ever.
[01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:16.110]  Yes.
[01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.950]  Right?
[01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:17.790]  They've got the best,
[01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:18.630]  I don't know what,
[01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:19.470]  whatever print stock they use.
[01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:20.390]  That stuff is glossy.
[01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:22.750]  It's available on Barnes and Noble across the nation.
[01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:25.150]  So like anybody, anywhere can get it now.
[01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:25.990]  Go check it out.
[01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:28.310]  And I'm in this month's episode,
[01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:29.670]  or no, it's not episode.
[01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:30.510]  Issue.
[01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:33.270]  There is an awesome picture of me,
[01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:34.310]  Jenny Stone.
[01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:35.150]  Who are you?
[01:21:35.150 --> 01:21:36.270]  The heady ambassador.
[01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:38.870]  And Action Bronson.
[01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:39.710]  Yeah.
[01:21:39.710 --> 01:21:41.590]  What did Action say to you?
[01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:43.710]  He said I was going to come on Ancient Aliens.
[01:21:43.710 --> 01:21:44.550]  Are you going to do it?
[01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:46.670]  Are you going to go talk about aliens with him?
[01:21:46.670 --> 01:21:48.070]  I told him, well,
[01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.710]  I see you smoke blunts.
[01:21:49.710 --> 01:21:51.470]  I don't smoke a lot of blunts.
[01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:53.310]  So your friends can't be sitting on the couch.
[01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:55.750]  You got to leave room on the couch for me.
[01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:57.950]  And we're going to break in all these heady pieces
[01:21:57.950 --> 01:22:00.150]  that I know you just bought today at Heaters.
[01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:02.630]  How did he feel about all that?
[01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:03.470]  He bought three pieces.
[01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:04.310]  He bought three sweet pieces?
[01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:05.150]  Yeah.
[01:22:05.150 --> 01:22:05.990]  So you got three,
[01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.830]  at least three jabs coming with Bronson.
[01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:09.510]  I know some of them are buck pieces too.
[01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:10.350]  So what was that?
[01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:11.870]  You told me that he gave you a quote.
[01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:14.350]  What was Bronson's quote of the day?
[01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:15.390]  What was it?
[01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:16.430]  What he said he had to go do.
[01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:17.430]  So you asked him to take a dab.
[01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:18.270]  What do you have to go do?
[01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:19.870]  Oh, but I can't do impressions.
[01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:21.390]  But it's still funny just knowing Bronson said that.
[01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:25.710]  Okay, he's got this thick Bronx accent.
[01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:28.670]  And he said, let's go get a sausage.
[01:22:28.670 --> 01:22:31.070]  And I said, what did you say?
[01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:32.670]  And he just kind of looked at me.
[01:22:32.670 --> 01:22:33.830]  And I said, say it again.
[01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:35.910]  I just love the way it sounds.
[01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:38.830]  How do you people from New York say sausages?
[01:22:40.710 --> 01:22:42.470]  Appealing to one's ears.
[01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:45.110]  They probably feel the same about us weird Colorado folks.
[01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:47.150]  Probably think we say some funny shit ourselves.
[01:22:47.150 --> 01:22:48.510]  He really is a nice guy.
[01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:50.590]  I do hope I get to sit down with him again.
[01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:52.350]  I hope you get to be on the Ancient Alien show.
[01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:54.830]  I hope maybe Vice just comes and does a dab in Granny show
[01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:55.670]  because you deserve some recognition.
[01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:56.510]  Yeah, that would be sweet.
[01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:57.350]  You can put it in.
[01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:58.190]  Speaking of shows,
[01:22:58.190 --> 01:23:01.510]  I believe the Traveling Stoner and Bobo just did an episode.
[01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:04.870]  Yes, can I please give a shout out to Daily Bong?
[01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:10.870]  Yeah, Daily Bong just had Chris and I on Blunted season two.
[01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:13.350]  And it was actually really funny because we get there
[01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:15.710]  and he had messaged me,
[01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:19.190]  honestly, he messaged me a month ago and he was like,
[01:23:19.190 --> 01:23:23.550]  hey, I'm gonna be coming out into Colorado
[01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:25.670]  and I'd love to get you and your man on there.
[01:23:25.670 --> 01:23:27.630]  I just really like y'all's vibes.
[01:23:27.630 --> 01:23:28.790]  And I was like, that'd be awesome.
[01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:29.910]  We'd love to be on it.
[01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:32.590]  I knew about the show because of Metal Damien.
[01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:35.110]  So he's on the show all the time
[01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:37.190]  because it's filmed in Miami.
[01:23:37.190 --> 01:23:39.390]  And so I said, yeah, absolutely.
[01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:41.270]  So then he messaged me at the beginning of the month
[01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:42.190]  and he's like, oh, I'm gonna be out there
[01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:43.350]  on the 15th and 16th.
[01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:44.590]  And I said, cool, yo.
[01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:47.430]  So we get there and I really, I just love watch the show.
[01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:49.750]  So I know that the way the show goes is
[01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:52.350]  you sit in front of a really bright light,
[01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:55.110]  you wear sunglasses and you smoke either like a joint
[01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:56.390]  or a blunt or something.
[01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:59.350]  And he asks you questions and you just answer them.
[01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:00.670]  And like the questions are, you know,
[01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:04.550]  in the bottom of the like screen.
[01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:07.710]  So I just knew that we were gonna get asked questions.
[01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:09.870]  And honestly, he had put up a picture that morning
[01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:10.910]  and he had tagged a bunch of people.
[01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:13.230]  So I didn't really know how it goes.
[01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:16.110]  So he doesn't let anybody like be around each other
[01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:17.630]  when they get taped.
[01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:20.070]  And if you're on the same episode
[01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:23.190]  and like you can get be in the same room.
[01:24:23.190 --> 01:24:24.550]  So we get there and he goes,
[01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:27.430]  oh, your episode's all about relationships.
[01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:29.590]  And I'm like, stone face.
[01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:31.950]  I'm like, you picked the wrong couple, dude.
[01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:33.990]  Straight up, you picked the wrong couple.
[01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.870]  You guys are a great couple.
[01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:37.350]  You're just not the classic TV show couple.
[01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:38.190]  Well, but that's what I mean.
[01:24:38.190 --> 01:24:40.190]  Like if that's what you were looking for out of this,
[01:24:40.190 --> 01:24:42.150]  you picked the wrong couple.
[01:24:42.150 --> 01:24:43.830]  So it was really funny
[01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:45.870]  because it was like the newlywed game style kind of.
[01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:47.990]  Like we didn't even stay in the room with each other
[01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:50.350]  and he asked us pretty much the same questions
[01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:52.750]  and like to see how we answer them.
[01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:54.790]  And it was pretty comical to be honest with you.
[01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:55.910]  Like I'm super stoked.
[01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:58.870]  Our episode is supposed to come out at the end of March
[01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:00.910]  where episode four of season two.
[01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:01.990]  So.
[01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:03.630]  He texted me yesterday.
[01:25:03.630 --> 01:25:04.470]  Did he?
[01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:06.950]  He'll be back here at the end of January
[01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:08.670]  and asked what I maybe come up.
[01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:11.150]  So I'm asking if maybe you guys will take me.
[01:25:11.150 --> 01:25:12.430]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:13.430]  Daily Bong, check it out.
[01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:15.350]  Yes, Daily Bong, shout out to them
[01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:18.230]  because it was so much fun to be honest with you.
[01:25:18.230 --> 01:25:20.350]  He asked just like, I mean, just,
[01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:22.310]  I don't wanna spoil our episodes.
[01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:24.350]  So I'll tell you what's been on other episodes.
[01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:25.190]  And it was really funny
[01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:28.110]  because I was at the Cana Canyon a couple of days before.
[01:25:28.150 --> 01:25:29.950]  So you're gonna spoil somebody else's episode?
[01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:30.790]  No, it's already up.
[01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:32.230]  I'm glad you said that.
[01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:33.630]  It's season one, it's already up.
[01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:34.670]  It's on YouTube.
[01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:35.510]  Okay.
[01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:36.350]  Yeah.
[01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:38.430]  So I was at the Cana Canyon the other day
[01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:40.110]  and I was showing Camille like the day,
[01:25:40.110 --> 01:25:41.750]  I was like, yo, look at what I get to go
[01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:42.590]  and do the other day.
[01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:43.430]  Like I'm kind of excited.
[01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:44.270]  She was the only person I told.
[01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:45.430]  I didn't even tell granny.
[01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:47.350]  Like granny called me on the way up
[01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:48.190]  and she's like, what are you doing?
[01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:50.390]  And I was like, okay, I'm going to do this really cool thing
[01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:51.990]  but I was showing Camille this and it was really funny
[01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:55.030]  because the question was ice cream or anal.
[01:25:55.030 --> 01:26:00.030]  And the amount of like guys that chose ice cream was insane.
[01:26:00.630 --> 01:26:03.550]  Like it was so funny to me.
[01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:04.390]  Yeah.
[01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:05.630]  And it was just mind blowing to me.
[01:26:05.630 --> 01:26:06.790]  And me and Cam were both like,
[01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:07.750]  I can't believe how many people
[01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:09.030]  are saying ice cream right now.
[01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:11.030]  Like this is actually insane to me.
[01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:13.310]  Maybe they thought they had to receive instead of give.
[01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:15.790]  Oh, good point.
[01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:16.870]  Good point.
[01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:17.750]  That could be it.
[01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:19.030]  I'd be saying ice cream too.
[01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:20.950]  But so like, so some of the questions are like,
[01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:22.270]  what's your favorite strain?
[01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:23.950]  You know, like, so yeah,
[01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:26.070]  it's just really funny because he just asked you
[01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:27.590]  these like questions and he doesn't ask them
[01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:28.430]  in a certain order.
[01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:30.350]  Like there's no like, what's your name?
[01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:31.230]  Where are you from?
[01:26:31.230 --> 01:26:33.030]  Like, it's not like a gradual thing.
[01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:34.670]  It's what's your name?
[01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:36.030]  Ice cream or anal?
[01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:37.150]  What's your favorite strain?
[01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:37.990]  Like, you know what I mean?
[01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:40.030]  Like it's so back and forth like that.
[01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:40.870]  So.
[01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:41.710]  What'd you just add Chris?
[01:26:41.710 --> 01:26:42.550]  That shit smells amazing.
[01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:43.390]  Yeah, what was it?
[01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:45.510]  He just made a face.
[01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:46.630]  Was it a turp tail?
[01:26:46.630 --> 01:26:47.470]  Oh, he's making a video.
[01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:49.070]  Oh wait, actually, I think I can see it right here.
[01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:53.110]  So I think he, the cookies from you guys at CGC.
[01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:54.110]  Did you put some solvent-less?
[01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:55.270]  CGC doing it.
[01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:57.190]  So you put some of this syringe on there?
[01:26:57.190 --> 01:26:59.150]  You just did this cookies on its own?
[01:26:59.150 --> 01:26:59.990]  You didn't use that on the test tube?
[01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.830]  He can't talk, he's so high right now.
[01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:01.830]  Yeah, sorry, I tried.
[01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:03.270]  Sometimes I can read him.
[01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:05.230]  Oh, some turps.
[01:27:05.230 --> 01:27:06.910]  ACDC turps, that's what he put on the-
[01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:09.110]  It smelled amazing when he blew it in my face.
[01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.950]  That was probably the ACDC.
[01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:11.470]  So he did the, yeah.
[01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:14.430]  It was a mix of everything.
[01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:15.630]  Still smells real good in here.
[01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:16.470]  Say that again?
[01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:17.310]  That's a damn good dab.
[01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:18.150]  Say that again for me.
[01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:18.990]  That was a mix of everything.
[01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:19.830]  That was amazing.
[01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:20.870]  Holy shit.
[01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:22.550]  Holy shit, that was good, man.
[01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:25.550]  He's a little reddish purple now,
[01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:26.390]  we'll give him a minute.
[01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:30.950]  You guys, I have to say, us dabbers are a breed of our own.
[01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:35.950]  I have this solvent-less stuff called White Crack OG.
[01:27:37.710 --> 01:27:40.390]  Now this stuff smells like some cheese
[01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:42.990]  that has been in a refrigerator with no bottom.
[01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:44.070]  Cheesy vomit.
[01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:47.270]  For about, yeah, after you had some bad cheese,
[01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:48.870]  you puked it out.
[01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:49.710]  Yes, everybody makes that.
[01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:50.550]  It's not even in here.
[01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:52.150]  It's not even in there.
[01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:58.950]  Every time I break this stuff up and people sniff it,
[01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:01.870]  their face is like, can I dab it?
[01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:03.990]  It smells like poop.
[01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.830]  Can I have some?
[01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:06.470]  It smells like your butt after a run.
[01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:09.510]  It's just amazing that we wanna dab something
[01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:11.790]  that smells so bad.
[01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:14.310]  I'm gonna take a dab of it just because I'm brave
[01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:16.870]  and I'm very curious what it actually tastes like.
[01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:17.710]  It's delicious.
[01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:18.550]  It's delicious.
[01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:20.070]  Just enough to taste, it's delicious, huh?
[01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:21.750]  It tastes just like your butt after a run.
[01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:22.590]  Fuck.
[01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:26.070]  No, after a suppository take-eat.
[01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:29.510]  There's none of that.
[01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:31.430]  We've already talked about it.
[01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:36.190]  But it tastes good, right?
[01:28:36.190 --> 01:28:38.230]  Yeah, it doesn't taste like dog poop or anything.
[01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:40.470]  It doesn't taste like the cheesy vomit it smells like.
[01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:41.550]  Cheesy vomit.
[01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:43.950]  That's exactly what it smells like.
[01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:44.950]  No, I approve though.
[01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:46.350]  Yeah, I'm high from it too.
[01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:49.750]  White Crack OG smells like a can of dog farts.
[01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:52.110]  So we assume that it's probably green crack.
[01:28:52.150 --> 01:28:53.270]  What do you think the white is?
[01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:54.750]  White Widow?
[01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:55.670]  The white?
[01:28:55.670 --> 01:28:56.630]  The white?
[01:28:56.630 --> 01:28:57.990]  The white probably, yeah.
[01:28:59.150 --> 01:29:00.110]  Don't get me on that rant.
[01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:01.870]  I hate that extraction companies do that.
[01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:05.590]  I think that it should say the white and green crack
[01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:07.310]  or something on there because that's misleading.
[01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:08.350]  We're medical consumers
[01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:10.310]  and we'd like to know what strains we're consuming.
[01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:13.670]  And there's a lot of people that don't have the knowledge.
[01:29:13.670 --> 01:29:16.230]  I have knowledge because I have friends like you guys
[01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:18.150]  that pass it on to me.
[01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:19.750]  Somebody might walk in there,
[01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:21.150]  they wouldn't know what the hell that is.
[01:29:22.150 --> 01:29:22.990]  And if they want it,
[01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:25.870]  maybe green crack gives them panic attacks
[01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:27.310]  and the white is perfect for them.
[01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:30.430]  Because we all know green crack is a pretty heavy sativa.
[01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:33.510]  And I'm learning more and more young bud tenders
[01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:35.870]  don't really know what different strains will do.
[01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:36.710]  That's very true.
[01:29:36.710 --> 01:29:38.070]  Oh God, please don't get me started.
[01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:40.150]  That's a whole episode, another one.
[01:29:40.150 --> 01:29:41.430]  Can we talk about something that you did
[01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:43.190]  since we've been talking about suppositories?
[01:29:43.190 --> 01:29:44.030]  Sure.
[01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:45.830]  I heard a rumor, I heard a little story
[01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:48.070]  that you took a gram of distillate
[01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:50.990]  and you used it as a suppository?
[01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:52.670]  How was that?
[01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:56.190]  Ping, ping, ping, crochet rabbit.
[01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:58.590]  So it was a sativa.
[01:29:58.590 --> 01:30:00.790]  What's so funny is she actually used green crack
[01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:01.630]  the first time she did it.
[01:30:01.630 --> 01:30:03.070]  That's what reminded my brain.
[01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:03.910]  It's in my notes that are on the floor.
[01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:05.990]  I used crack in my crack.
[01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:08.950]  So you put some green crack in your brown crack
[01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:10.630]  and it made you bounce around all day.
[01:30:10.630 --> 01:30:11.870]  It was a heavy sativa.
[01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:16.270]  Yes, I guess for cleaning the house or something,
[01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:18.430]  but it was a little too much.
[01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:20.190]  I would not recommend.
[01:30:20.710 --> 01:30:22.470]  I have a pretty high tolerance.
[01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:25.710]  So if I'm saying I don't recommend maybe half a gram.
[01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:29.110]  Or just use a normal suppository.
[01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.950]  Yes, yes.
[01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:33.270]  Because a butt tender told me to do it.
[01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:34.110]  So you did.
[01:30:34.110 --> 01:30:37.030]  They told me to jump off the bridge.
[01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.870]  I tried it.
[01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:39.190]  I thought I was gonna go read.
[01:30:39.190 --> 01:30:42.110]  I don't think you need the entire syringe.
[01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:44.630]  One thing I will say about these syringes,
[01:30:44.630 --> 01:30:46.350]  they're good for cooking.
[01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:47.470]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:49.710]  Do you wanna put a little distillate in your food?
[01:30:50.710 --> 01:30:52.550]  Meatballs and spaghetti sauce.
[01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:54.550]  I might have some hot cocoa
[01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:56.350]  with some distillate in it later tonight.
[01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:58.630]  Oh no, I have a different way to make hot cocoa.
[01:30:58.630 --> 01:30:59.710]  Shumit bars.
[01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:00.870]  Shout out to Caleb.
[01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:02.710]  Did you see my picture the other night?
[01:31:02.710 --> 01:31:04.270]  That was so awesome.
[01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:08.790]  I made, I had some s'mores hot cocoa.
[01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:10.190]  Made that, it was real,
[01:31:10.190 --> 01:31:13.870]  and I made it with milk, cold milk, nice and creamy.
[01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:17.910]  I took a 200 milligram Shumit s'mores bar
[01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:19.790]  and grated that in there.
[01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:23.310]  Oh, I feel warm and fuzzy inside just thinking about it.
[01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:24.870]  A big dollop of marshmallow cream.
[01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:26.830]  Oh my gosh.
[01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:28.510]  It was so good.
[01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:30.790]  I drank that all, all 200 milligrams.
[01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:31.790]  I slept really good that night.
[01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:33.070]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:35.430]  They're made with pure distillate.
[01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:36.510]  They're so good.
[01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:37.350]  That's my favorite edible right now.
[01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:39.990]  Caleb makes good candy.
[01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:41.590]  Really good candy.
[01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:43.790]  I go through these phases where I do and don't do edibles,
[01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:45.590]  and I think one of our good friends
[01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:47.150]  may have just messed up my edibles kit,
[01:31:47.190 --> 01:31:48.510]  because I was back on the horse.
[01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:49.470]  No, you shouldn't.
[01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.510]  You'll be fine.
[01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:51.590]  No, I know what Jeff is saying.
[01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:52.990]  It stays with me for too long.
[01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:54.670]  The next day, like I feel really good
[01:31:54.670 --> 01:31:55.510]  when I eat the edibles,
[01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:57.390]  but the next day I feel slow motion,
[01:31:57.390 --> 01:31:58.870]  and I'm a very productive dude,
[01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:59.990]  and I can't be dragging ass.
[01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:01.750]  And you got them brain locks like,
[01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:03.350]  oh, I just, I can't think.
[01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:05.270]  A little bit, but it's more my body.
[01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:07.510]  I feel like I'm just, I'm weighed down.
[01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:08.870]  Like I've just got weights on my legs.
[01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:10.350]  How much are you eating?
[01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:11.190]  Way too much.
[01:32:11.190 --> 01:32:12.310]  Yeah, but that was the issue,
[01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:16.310]  was the two times that we've eaten too much.
[01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:18.390]  First time was your own fault.
[01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:20.350]  Second time, we didn't realize
[01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:21.710]  how much that cake was, really.
[01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:23.590]  Yeah, we ate a cake at Lindsay's birthday.
[01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:24.430]  Yeah.
[01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:26.430]  And I, yeah, I-
[01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:28.230]  Is that what made the car?
[01:32:28.230 --> 01:32:29.230]  Yes, I was floating.
[01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:31.310]  I was certainly floating.
[01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:33.710]  In our defense, we tried to do,
[01:32:33.710 --> 01:32:35.870]  like, you know, we tried to do smaller slices,
[01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:36.950]  but the restaurant wasn't having it.
[01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:38.070]  They were super polite.
[01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:40.550]  They all have learned that I'm a strict vegetarian,
[01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:42.150]  and they put bacon on the cake,
[01:32:42.150 --> 01:32:45.590]  and there was a specific section of cake with no bacon.
[01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:47.670]  So they were super polite about it,
[01:32:47.670 --> 01:32:49.030]  and they were trivious and fed me.
[01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:50.670]  So I was like, I'm gonna eat this.
[01:32:50.670 --> 01:32:52.110]  And it was super tasty.
[01:32:52.110 --> 01:32:53.910]  But by the next morning, when I was still high,
[01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:54.750]  when I woke up, I was like,
[01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:56.670]  what the fuck did they put in that thing?
[01:32:56.670 --> 01:32:58.670]  And it was TNT Extraction Center.
[01:32:58.670 --> 01:32:59.670]  Yes, yes.
[01:32:59.670 --> 01:33:01.590]  He's gotten both of us.
[01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:03.910]  And I'm the plug, not the extension cord.
[01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:04.750]  Duane as well.
[01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:06.470]  It was both of them, Max and Duane.
[01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:09.110]  I don't believe I met, not-
[01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:10.670]  They're always together, so you probably have.
[01:33:10.670 --> 01:33:11.630]  You probably have.
[01:33:11.630 --> 01:33:14.350]  You probably just, you know, don't realize it, but,
[01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:15.670]  or yeah.
[01:33:15.670 --> 01:33:16.830]  But yeah, shout out to them,
[01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:19.470]  because that cake was superb,
[01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:21.830]  and the bacon that they made, well, you know.
[01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:22.670]  Oh, his bacon is good.
[01:33:22.670 --> 01:33:25.270]  You don't know, but the bacon that they make is really good,
[01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:29.030]  and the hash that they make is super good too.
[01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:30.190]  The hash was delicious.
[01:33:30.190 --> 01:33:31.950]  They know that I don't eat the bacon,
[01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:34.470]  so they bring extra concentrates to dab with me.
[01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:35.710]  They're like, we brought this for you, buddy,
[01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:37.150]  just so that they could kind of make it.
[01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:38.070]  Like, we're sorry.
[01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:40.030]  We're sorry you're involved here.
[01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:40.870]  This is what you get.
[01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:42.830]  You don't get bacon, you get this.
[01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:44.870]  And for you listeners out there,
[01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:46.910]  I know you hear them silly ass rumors
[01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:50.790]  about ODing from cannabis.
[01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:51.630]  It doesn't happen.
[01:33:51.630 --> 01:33:53.430]  We're not gonna hallucinate like that.
[01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:54.550]  We've been trying all night.
[01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:55.390]  Yeah, for real.
[01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:56.230]  But that reporter said-
[01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:58.030]  It's Chris's goal to OD on weed.
[01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:59.950]  He wants to be the first person to ever OD on weed.
[01:33:59.950 --> 01:34:01.870]  Do you wanna hallucinate from cannabis?
[01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:02.710]  I mean, come on.
[01:34:02.710 --> 01:34:04.070]  We're trying so hard, we're putting it in our butts,
[01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:05.070]  and it's not working.
[01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:05.910]  Legitimately.
[01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:06.870]  You know what's gonna happen?
[01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:08.350]  You're gonna take a whole lot.
[01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:09.310]  You're gonna dab a lot.
[01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:12.510]  You're gonna do too many suppositories.
[01:34:13.630 --> 01:34:14.910]  You're gonna fall asleep.
[01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:17.230]  You're gonna wake up tomorrow,
[01:34:17.230 --> 01:34:18.710]  you're gonna have a weed over.
[01:34:18.710 --> 01:34:19.550]  Yep.
[01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:20.390]  Like Jeff said.
[01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:21.230]  Gonna be hungry.
[01:34:21.230 --> 01:34:22.070]  Yep.
[01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.910]  Very.
[01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:23.750]  Little lazy.
[01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:24.590]  Yep.
[01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:25.430]  Dehydrated, possibly.
[01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:26.270]  Need some caffeine.
[01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:27.470]  That's why you'll always see water with dabbers.
[01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:29.070]  We always have liquids around us.
[01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:30.070]  Caffeine and water.
[01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.910]  They keep me alive.
[01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:31.870]  Yep.
[01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:34.550]  So, contrary to the bullshit you hear
[01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:37.790]  on some of them news shows on TV,
[01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:41.350]  you're not gonna overdose on cannabis.
[01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:42.830]  The only way you can die from cannabis
[01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:44.630]  is if a ton of it falls on your head and kills you.
[01:34:44.630 --> 01:34:45.470]  And that's Joe Rogan's big technique.
[01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:46.790]  Or maybe if you're eating a pound
[01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:48.590]  and it lodges in your throat.
[01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:50.230]  I mean, but who's gonna really?
[01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:51.390]  Or if the cops kick in your door
[01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:52.310]  and kill you for having it.
[01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:53.550]  That could be.
[01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:54.870]  That's the problem with cannabis.
[01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:56.470]  Police are more dangerous than cannabis.
[01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:59.390]  Jell-O is more dangerous than cannabis.
[01:34:59.390 --> 01:35:00.230]  All right.
[01:35:00.230 --> 01:35:01.790]  You guys, we've been going for an hour and 35 minutes.
[01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:02.990]  This is one of the longest podcasts.
[01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:04.190]  Yeah, so there's no reason to stop it.
[01:35:04.190 --> 01:35:06.270]  The conversation got natural and wonderful.
[01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:07.270]  I was like, I'm gonna let this keep going.
[01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:08.630]  But you look exhausted over there.
[01:35:08.630 --> 01:35:09.470]  No, I'm just.
[01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.310]  I've been enjoying.
[01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:11.150]  You tired?
[01:35:11.150 --> 01:35:11.990]  You're all right.
[01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:13.510]  You guys are super quiet and sat back.
[01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:15.110]  I was like, oh, she's got to drive two hours.
[01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:15.950]  It's one of them waves.
[01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:16.950]  Yeah, no, but no.
[01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:18.510]  It's one of them waves.
[01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:19.510]  My only thought was,
[01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:20.950]  well, you guys were talking about the edibles.
[01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:22.270]  That's the problem with them these days.
[01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:25.670]  They are so good that you just eat more of it.
[01:35:25.670 --> 01:35:26.910]  Yeah, we've talked on this show
[01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:28.190]  that we need to buy edibles
[01:35:28.190 --> 01:35:30.150]  that come with like package A and package B.
[01:35:30.150 --> 01:35:31.830]  And A is medicated and B is not.
[01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:32.950]  So that you can eat one of A
[01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:35.310]  and then four or five of B and be all right.
[01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:37.830]  Because we find ourselves wrecked at this table sometimes
[01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:38.830]  when it's edibles night.
[01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:41.750]  Yeah, we're actually looking at doing one of our edibles
[01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:44.190]  being primarily CBD.
[01:35:44.190 --> 01:35:45.030]  Okay.
[01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.870]  Lower THC.
[01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:46.710]  Yeah.
[01:35:46.710 --> 01:35:48.990]  So, you know, to kind of, just for that market.
[01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:49.950]  So, cause you know, again,
[01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:51.470]  the edibles market's already been created.
[01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:52.990]  So we want to kind of come in
[01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:55.230]  and bring something off or something else.
[01:35:55.230 --> 01:35:57.670]  So it's going to be a high CBD, low THC ratios.
[01:35:57.670 --> 01:35:58.510]  Excellent.
[01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:59.430]  Don't know exactly what those are yet.
[01:35:59.430 --> 01:36:00.790]  Those to be announced.
[01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:01.630]  Soon come.
[01:36:01.630 --> 01:36:02.470]  Yes.
[01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:04.350]  It's cannabis industry is always evolving.
[01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:05.190]  I love it.
[01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:07.310]  Every week there's something new we didn't have.
[01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:08.150]  What's the new thing?
[01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:11.350]  The high terpene.
[01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:14.270]  What's the HTSFERQ.
[01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:15.110]  HTS.
[01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:15.950]  ERQ.
[01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:16.790]  ERQ.
[01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:18.230]  I think you had it for a while.
[01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:23.190]  The high terpene full spectrum extract.
[01:36:23.190 --> 01:36:24.230]  Holy shit.
[01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:25.070]  Yeah.
[01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.910]  I can't even do it.
[01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:26.750]  What is this?
[01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:27.590]  Yeah, sure.
[01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:28.910]  It's the new tech.
[01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:30.790]  It's like that sauce kind of,
[01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:33.230]  it's where it separates and that shit I got.
[01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:34.070]  Yeah.
[01:36:34.190 --> 01:36:35.030]  That's part of it.
[01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.870]  That's something.
[01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:36.710]  I got some of that.
[01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:37.550]  Chris doesn't have a microphone.
[01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:38.390]  You guys can have a chat.
[01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:40.790]  So what it was, how he explained it to me,
[01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:43.990]  it's like terp sauce, but it's potent shit.
[01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.830]  Right, right.
[01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:45.990]  That's what they call it, full spectrum.
[01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.830]  The FS in it.
[01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:49.510]  He called it, and it's super lemon haze.
[01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:51.110]  So it's straight sativa to the dome.
[01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:52.590]  Oh, hell yes.
[01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:56.350]  But he called it sugar wax without the sugar.
[01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:57.190]  Okay.
[01:36:57.190 --> 01:36:58.030]  That kind of makes sense.
[01:36:58.030 --> 01:37:00.070]  And when you tip it, I mean, it's-
[01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.910]  It's liquidy?
[01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:01.750]  Yes.
[01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:02.590]  Yeah, that's what it should be.
[01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:03.430]  But it's not like this terps.
[01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:04.750]  It's not like evil lab terps.
[01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:06.190]  Yeah, what she got is just,
[01:37:06.190 --> 01:37:09.870]  she got just the crystals by themselves
[01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:11.990]  and then the sauce in its own vial.
[01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.830]  Okay.
[01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:14.710]  So she got like just the top layer of terps
[01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:16.470]  that just comes off in its own vial
[01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:20.710]  of just like lemony, skunky, unbelievableness.
[01:37:20.710 --> 01:37:22.270]  It was good stuff, wasn't it?
[01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:23.470]  It was so good.
[01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:24.790]  So let's shout him out too.
[01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:26.430]  Yoshi Extracts.
[01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:27.910]  Yeah, Yoshi Extracts.
[01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:30.070]  You make good super lemon haze.
[01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:31.230]  That's so good.
[01:37:31.230 --> 01:37:32.630]  So Yoshi, hit me up, brother man.
[01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:34.390]  Come on, what's going on?
[01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:35.990]  Girlfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:37.790]  I love women.
[01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:40.190]  All right, guys, we've been going for an hour and 36 minutes.
[01:37:40.190 --> 01:37:42.230]  I think it's probably a good time to wrap up the podcast.
[01:37:42.230 --> 01:37:44.270]  I know everybody's got to get out of town to get home.
[01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:45.710]  These kids live across town.
[01:37:45.710 --> 01:37:47.110]  I need a big fat dab.
[01:37:47.110 --> 01:37:48.910]  Does anybody have anything they'd like to say
[01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:52.190]  while they've still got a bunch of people listening to them?
[01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:53.030]  Nothing, Chris?
[01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.870]  You don't want to be like,
[01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:55.990]  check out my Instagram and buy my glass.
[01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:57.990]  Yeah, definitely check out Nomi Glass.
[01:37:58.830 --> 01:38:00.990]  And definitely check out Bobo Blaster Co.
[01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.830]  There you go.
[01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:02.790]  Good job.
[01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:03.790]  Lindsay, tell us about your website.
[01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:04.630]  Sorry, I didn't mean to skip you there.
[01:38:04.630 --> 01:38:06.150]  I'm just going to go around in a circle.
[01:38:06.150 --> 01:38:06.990]  Cool, yo.
[01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:08.350]  I am the Traveling Stoner
[01:38:08.350 --> 01:38:11.510]  and thetravelingstoner.com will be up and running
[01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:13.190]  on January 31st.
[01:38:13.190 --> 01:38:14.870]  And she just hit 5,000.
[01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:16.430]  Well, over five now.
[01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:18.950]  Yeah, actually, I just think I hit 56.
[01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:20.070]  You can go, girl.
[01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:21.550]  Yeah.
[01:38:21.550 --> 01:38:23.830]  Yeah, so that's the Traveling Stoner on Instagram.
[01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:26.030]  And I'm pretty much that solidly-ish
[01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:27.510]  in variations across the board.
[01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:28.350]  Yeah, check her out, you guys.
[01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:29.190]  Periscope.
[01:38:29.190 --> 01:38:30.030]  Periscope.
[01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:31.870]  She's been periscoping a lot in the mornings.
[01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:33.070]  Yes.
[01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.990]  She wears clothes now.
[01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:35.110]  Yep.
[01:38:35.110 --> 01:38:35.950]  Thanks.
[01:38:35.950 --> 01:38:40.950]  But she has a really cute booger on her mouth.
[01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:44.710]  Her dog is cute.
[01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:46.310]  I like watching those snaps and periscopes
[01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:47.150]  with Scoob.
[01:38:47.150 --> 01:38:49.630]  I like her little white panties.
[01:38:49.630 --> 01:38:50.470]  Dodging this.
[01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:51.310]  Yeah, I know.
[01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:52.150]  Dodging this conversation.
[01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:53.310]  I'm trying, I'm trying.
[01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:55.190]  You can't, you can't dodge it with her.
[01:38:55.190 --> 01:38:56.550]  But yeah, Scooby's cute as hell, man.
[01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:57.390]  Yes, yes.
[01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:58.350]  For sure.
[01:38:58.350 --> 01:39:02.190]  So yeah, you can follow our Grow on Instagram.
[01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:05.230]  We've got a Grow site or a Grow page or whatever.
[01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:06.710]  Okay, so like your commercial Grow,
[01:39:06.710 --> 01:39:07.990]  you can actually check the progress there?
[01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.830]  Exactly.
[01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:10.270]  Okay, I'm gonna follow that myself.
[01:39:10.270 --> 01:39:11.110]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:13.590]  So that's CGC Black Label.
[01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:14.430]  Okay.
[01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:17.550]  We've just had some internet or Instagram troll,
[01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:18.390]  is that what it's called,
[01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:19.750]  that's kind of given us a hard time
[01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:21.030]  on our Concentrate side.
[01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:22.750]  So I'm still working on that.
[01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:24.230]  But you can definitely follow us
[01:39:24.230 --> 01:39:25.070]  and get in touch with us through that one directly too.
[01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:26.630]  You gotta get used to the trolls.
[01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:27.590]  Yeah.
[01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:28.790]  Just block them and move forward.
[01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:30.270]  Those are Jeff's favorites.
[01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:32.550]  I'll slay a fucking troll if I need to.
[01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:33.470]  Bring it, come on.
[01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:36.430]  Me too, you ever been in one of my live feeds?
[01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:38.830]  We handle them fairly similarly, yep.
[01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:39.670]  Yeah.
[01:39:39.670 --> 01:39:41.070]  I was just gonna say, do you have any names
[01:39:41.070 --> 01:39:44.470]  you wanna shout out that our trolls can go after?
[01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:46.710]  Yeah, no, I'm not like that.
[01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:48.590]  I'm not vindictive, let him do his thing.
[01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:51.830]  He'll eventually settle down and move on.
[01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:53.270]  All right, all right.
[01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:55.430]  So you've got a Grow Instagram that we can follow,
[01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:57.110]  CGC Black Label.
[01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:57.950]  Yes.
[01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:59.430]  How else can we follow you on social media?
[01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:00.430]  If you want us to, you don't have to give us
[01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:01.270]  your personal stuff. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:03.190]  I mean, my personal one, which is,
[01:40:03.190 --> 01:40:05.270]  I mean, if you wanna see part of my personal life as well,
[01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:07.470]  but I do put products and information
[01:40:07.470 --> 01:40:10.630]  about the products and stuff that we have
[01:40:10.630 --> 01:40:12.430]  and CGC in general.
[01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:15.790]  It's Sserendipity93 is my personal one.
[01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:17.230]  All right, you'll get some follows from that.
[01:40:17.230 --> 01:40:19.710]  Yeah, she has a cool lizard.
[01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:21.030]  His name's Diego.
[01:40:22.590 --> 01:40:24.150]  I'm already curious, now I'm gonna go follow
[01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:25.390]  just because of Diego.
[01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:26.590]  Oh, and there's Smiley.
[01:40:26.590 --> 01:40:27.950]  Smiley's a hoot too.
[01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:29.510]  What type of creature is Smiley?
[01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:30.670]  Smiley's my Corgi.
[01:40:30.670 --> 01:40:32.550]  Okay, how cute, how cute.
[01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:33.870]  But this big-ish?
[01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:34.710]  Lap, lap-sized?
[01:40:34.710 --> 01:40:36.150]  No, he's like, he's pretty fat.
[01:40:36.150 --> 01:40:36.990]  He's a big guy.
[01:40:36.990 --> 01:40:37.830]  He's pretty fat.
[01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:39.190]  What are you feeding that thing?
[01:40:39.190 --> 01:40:40.590]  He's just, he's a big guy.
[01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:41.910]  We just call him Fat Man, so.
[01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:44.270]  Fat Man, happy dog, happy dog.
[01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:45.190]  Well, thank you for coming on the show.
[01:40:45.190 --> 01:40:46.030]  I appreciate it.
[01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:46.870]  It's always great to have new people.
[01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:48.910]  We learned a lot about suppositories today.
[01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:50.550]  I learned a lot about your other products.
[01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:51.830]  People learned about Solventless.
[01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:52.990]  They learned about Rosin.
[01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:55.550]  So thank you for helping me teach people about cannabis.
[01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:56.950]  Thank you, I really appreciate it.
[01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:58.110]  You're welcome back when you have more products
[01:40:58.110 --> 01:40:59.310]  or when you just wanna come hang out.
[01:40:59.310 --> 01:41:00.150]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:41:00.150 --> 01:41:01.830]  You don't have to have products.
[01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:03.790]  Oh, I never come empty-handed.
[01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:05.550]  I'm a good guest.
[01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:06.390]  I appreciate that.
[01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:08.910]  All right, Miss Granny, it's your turn.
[01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:10.150]  Oh, thank you for having me.
[01:41:10.150 --> 01:41:12.910]  I think I probably said everything I needed to say
[01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:15.350]  and that's really unbelievable, isn't it?
[01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:17.070]  But it's always a pleasure to come
[01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:18.430]  and hang out with you, Rasta Jeff.
[01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:19.630]  I enjoy it all the time.
[01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:20.790]  I appreciate you coming and hanging out.
[01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:21.630]  It's super kind of you.
[01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:22.990]  You guys come from Colorado Springs.
[01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:23.830]  That's super kind of you.
[01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:24.790]  Do you come from Denver or Springs?
[01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:25.630]  Actually, Denver.
[01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:27.350]  Wow, so you've got two hours to get home.
[01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:28.190]  Thanks for staying.
[01:41:28.190 --> 01:41:29.550]  Yeah, I gotta take Granny up and then I'm on my way.
[01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:30.390]  Yeah, Granny, keep her awake.
[01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:31.550]  Thank you, Lindsey.
[01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:32.750]  Thank you, Traveling Stoner,
[01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:34.790]  for always putting things together.
[01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:35.910]  You guys got it.
[01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:36.750]  That's what I'm here for.
[01:41:36.750 --> 01:41:37.590]  You're the best.
[01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:40.190]  I'm here to help get everyone together in one place.
[01:41:40.190 --> 01:41:42.430]  Yes, this podcast is not out of reach.
[01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:43.350]  Some people have told me, they're like,
[01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:44.510]  dude, I'd love to be on your show,
[01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:45.870]  but I don't know what I would do.
[01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:46.910]  You would come and you would talk.
[01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:47.750]  It's not that hard.
[01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:48.870]  I've got a chair, I've got a microphone,
[01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:49.830]  and you just run your face.
[01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:52.270]  We're gonna do it without a microphone anyway,
[01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:53.590]  so come and let me know what you've got to say.
[01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:56.150]  If you wanna be on the podcast and you're not crazy
[01:41:56.150 --> 01:41:57.990]  and you've got something interesting to talk about,
[01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.830]  send me an email.
[01:41:58.830 --> 01:42:00.550]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:02.230]  I'd love to get all kinds of people on the show.
[01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:05.190]  Open up the audience, open up the members.
[01:42:05.190 --> 01:42:06.030]  What are you guys, the guests?
[01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:06.870]  Open it up.
[01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:09.190]  Just teach more, learn more, do more, better podcast.
[01:42:09.190 --> 01:42:10.550]  Come be on the show.
[01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:11.790]  I'm gonna talk about Patreon
[01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:12.990]  and then we're gonna wrap up the podcast.
[01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:15.430]  I would love it if you guys go to patreon.com.
[01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:16.870]  What Patreon is is a website
[01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:19.390]  that would allow you to support the podcast financially.
[01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:21.350]  I'm not trying to get rich off the podcast, you guys.

[01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:25.110]  Free freedom, free cannabis lessons, free love.
[01:42:25.110 --> 01:42:26.110]  I do it from my heart.
[01:42:26.110 --> 01:42:27.910]  I can't shut the fuck up about cannabis.
[01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:29.390]  This is my way of putting it out.
[01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:30.830]  I love weed, I love you guys,
[01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:33.030]  but if you wanna throw a buck or two my way,

[01:42:40.630 --> 01:42:42.350]  or you can throw down as many dollars as a month
[01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:43.550]  that you would like.
[01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:45.430]  What that will do is it'll help me pay for my website.
[01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:47.030]  I read geneticscolorado.com.
[01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:49.070]  It is a little costly to keep that website up
[01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:51.670]  and that is where the podcast is hosted.
[01:42:51.670 --> 01:42:54.110]  So just help me pay for that a little bit if you can.
[01:42:54.110 --> 01:42:55.270]  If you can, I would appreciate it.
[01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:56.550]  If you can't do it, I still love you.
[01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:58.110]  High five, big hug, fat dabs.
[01:42:58.110 --> 01:42:58.950]  We're still gonna be friends,
[01:42:58.950 --> 01:43:00.230]  but there are a few people out there
[01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:02.110]  that can certainly afford to throw a buck or two my way.
[01:43:02.110 --> 01:43:03.150]  I would appreciate it.
[01:43:03.150 --> 01:43:04.150]  We'll keep the podcast going.
[01:43:04.150 --> 01:43:06.230]  We'll keep it free forever for everyone.
[01:43:06.230 --> 01:43:08.430]  So patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:10.030]  That's all I'm gonna say about that.
[01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:11.830]  I think that was Forrest Gumpy when I said that.
[01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:13.310]  That's all I'm gonna say about that.
[01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:14.870]  All right, we're gonna end it with that.
[01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:17.630]  Once again, check out handmadeapparel.biz.
[01:43:17.630 --> 01:43:19.190]  Thank you everybody for coming.
[01:43:19.190 --> 01:43:20.550]  I'm gonna wrap up the show.
[01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:22.590]  Big shout out to, who did we give,
[01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:23.790]  when we gave shout outs to everybody?
[01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:25.030]  We always end the show with one big shout out.
[01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.870]  Who's it going to this time?
[01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:26.990]  Somebody throw me an idea.
[01:43:28.710 --> 01:43:30.350]  Silence, big shout out to silence.
[01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:31.190]  Brett.
[01:43:31.190 --> 01:43:32.710]  Brett from Evo Labs?
[01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:33.550]  Yeah, for just-
[01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:34.390]  Brett from Evo Labs.
[01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:35.910]  Dancy Brett, Mary's Motivation.
[01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:36.750]  Yeah, Mary's Motivation.
[01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:38.910]  He's in this month's THC magazine as well.
[01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:39.750]  Oh, there we go.
[01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:40.910]  He is with a big cheesy smile.
[01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:41.750]  Yes, he has acceptance.
[01:43:42.190 --> 01:43:43.990]  Yes, he has acceptance in that award.
[01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:45.230]  Vape pen of the year.
[01:43:45.230 --> 01:43:46.070]  Yes.
[01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:47.510]  So, yep, shout out to Mary's Motivation.
[01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:48.750]  Just because I love him.
[01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:49.590]  And actually-
[01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:51.990]  Every time I see him, he's so happy to see me
[01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:54.870]  and it's so genuine and I just love Brett.
[01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:56.390]  And he is so positive.
[01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:57.230]  Yes.
[01:43:57.230 --> 01:44:00.510]  He wants to spread the most positive messages
[01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:01.950]  about cannabis.
[01:44:01.950 --> 01:44:03.350]  He's just a good guy.
[01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:05.430]  And he gave me a fat sack of weed
[01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:07.390]  for my birthday that he grew.
[01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:09.030]  Some lemon skunk diesel.
[01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:10.550]  Like, he knows me so well.
[01:44:10.590 --> 01:44:11.790]  He gave me a fat sack.
[01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:13.550]  He's like, this is for you for your birthday.
[01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:14.390]  I was like, yes.
[01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:15.230]  Thank you, Brett.
[01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:16.070]  A unanimous decision.
[01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:18.390]  Big shout out to our friend Brett from Evo Lab.
[01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:19.510]  Make sure you follow him on Instagram.
[01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:20.870]  It's Mary's underscore motivation.
[01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:21.710]  No, he took the underscore out.
[01:44:21.710 --> 01:44:23.070]  Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
[01:44:23.070 --> 01:44:24.470]  Just Mary's Motivation.
[01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:25.470]  He took the underscore out.
[01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:26.830]  Mary's Motivation.
[01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:27.750]  Brett from Evo Lab.
[01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:28.910]  Big shout out, brother.
[01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:31.230]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[01:44:31.230 --> 01:44:32.830]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:51.820]  I ain't put no boogie in nobody's butt.
[01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:52.660]  That's nasty, man.
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:45:47.600]  What you talking about?
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.920]  I ain't play, that's bad.
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.520]  I ain't put no trees in nobody's butt,
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:52.120]  no bees in nobody's butt.
[01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:50.460]  Hey, what's this?
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:51.300]  A hundred dollar bill.
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:31.520]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:33.480]  It's time for episode number 177
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:35.240]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:38.680]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:39.760]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:40.800]  if you're a professional grower,
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:43.000]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.240]  if you're a cannabis activist
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:45.680]  or even someone who's just curious
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.320]  about the current state of cannabis,
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.600]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:51.760]  I'm your host.
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:52.800]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:54.600]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.640]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:58.160]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.360]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:01.960]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot,
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.920]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:08.920]  Yeah, I wanna give a huge shout out to my huge audience.
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:13.640]  You guys, the podcast was ranked number 963 on Stitcher.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:16.000]  Stitcher hosts, I think they brag
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.360]  that they have 50,000 podcasts available on their service.
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:20.600]  And the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:25.560]  was recently ranked number 963 overall.
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.440]  So I wanna thank everybody for listening on Stitcher.
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:29.360]  I wanna thank everybody for listening also on Stitcher.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:33.360]  We were ranked number 80 in the society and culture category.
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.680]  So we were in a top 100 section on Stitcher.
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:36.760]  Makes me super proud.
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:38.840]  Thank you guys for listening, for supporting the show.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:41.000]  iTunes doesn't show me a lot of stats or anything.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.040]  iTunes doesn't give a shit.
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.480]  So I don't know where I stand on iTunes,
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:45.560]  but on Stitcher, we are crushing it.
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:46.800]  Big thanks to everybody.
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.680]  Also, big thank you to everybody who listened
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:52.400]  to the episode with Solventless Shannon and Dab and Granny.
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:53.240]  That was a great episode.
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:55.000]  Also, Lindsey and Chris were here.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.800]  Yes, they did put some stuff in their butt.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.080]  I got a couple of messages that said,
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:59.720]  hey bro, as soon as you guys started talking
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:01.840]  about putting things in your butt, I checked out.
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.160]  One of my friends said that he was getting
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:05.160]  some mental images and some visuals,
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:07.440]  and he did not wanna contaminate his brain like that.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:08.840]  So he listened to about three minutes
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.480]  of the show and checked out.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:12.080]  I apologize if that was too much for you,
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:15.120]  but thanks to everybody that listened to the podcast.
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:16.160]  I appreciate it.
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:18.080]  Also, big thanks to Solventless Shannon
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.440]  and Dab and Granny for coming and being on the podcast.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.360]  I look forward to having both of those lovely ladies
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.360]  on the podcast again, and you know we will get
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:26.480]  the Traveling Stoner and Bobo Blaster Co.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:28.320]  back on the show real soon.
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.160]  Shout out, kids.
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:30.440]  I hope you guys are doing well.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:31.720]  Let's see, where else am I?
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:32.680]  Handmade.
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:35.080]  Big shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.

[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:07.340]  They will take great care of you.
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:09.500]  All right, I am pulling up a message on my phone here,
[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:11.660]  but I've got an iPhone and it's acting funny.
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:12.620]  You know how that shit goes.
[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:13.820]  It's like you're listening to music.
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:14.780]  You have to unlock me.
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:15.760]  You have to do eight other things
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:17.500]  to get to the message you want.
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:18.460]  Got the message.
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:19.620]  Here we go.
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:22.460]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friend Mountain Smokes.
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:23.520]  A few episodes back,
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:25.460]  I did an episode called Follow Your Nose,
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:28.000]  and I talked about sour diesel and Hispanic folks.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.300]  I felt like I may be a bit racist
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:32.260]  calling out the folks of Latin descent
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:33.660]  for liking sour diesel,
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:36.220]  but I felt that was something that I noticed.
[01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:38.300]  And my friend Mountain Smokes on Snapchat
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:39.140]  sent me a message.
[01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:42.300]  She said, oh my gosh, the sour diesel bit's so true.
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:43.660]  Being from Gunnison County,
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:45.740]  another heavily populated area,
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:48.060]  sour diesel has always been growing in the basements,
[01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:50.020]  and it was by far the most popular strain
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:51.940]  I sold there, spot on.
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:54.220]  Then she also says, also love the podcast once again,
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:58.060]  and yes, follow your nose, so very true.
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:51:58.900]  So thanks for the message,
[01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:00.980]  and big shout out to my friend Mountain Smokes on Snapchat.
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.760]  Make sure you follow her on Snapchat.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:03.600]  She's a cutie.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:04.500]  She smokes cannabis.
[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:05.820]  She's a great cannabis activist,
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:07.660]  and she is learning a whole bunch
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:08.940]  and becoming very knowledgeable,
[01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:12.020]  and she likes to share that stuff with her viewers on Snap.
[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:14.900]  So check her out and follow her.
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:16.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna get right to an email.
[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:20.140]  I've got a long email here about powdery mildew,
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:22.140]  and I feel like I can really give some help,
[01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:24.820]  so I'm pulling up the email while I talk.
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:25.660]  Where is it?
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:26.480]  Here we go.
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:28.340]  All right, the email goes like this.
[01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:31.180]  Yo, love the podcast, long time listener,
[01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:32.780]  hashtag love it when you ramble.
[01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:34.300]  Shout out to White Mike.
[01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:35.660]  White Mike, you got a shout out, bro.
[01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:36.700]  I hope you heard that.
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:38.400]  You guys, we'll get White Mike back on the podcast
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.940]  real soon, he'll be here.
[01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:40.780]  He's got a young child.
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:41.620]  He's got a wife.
[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:43.260]  He can't be on every episode,
[01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:44.340]  but we'll get him back pretty soon.
[01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:46.340]  Shout out, bro, I hope you're doing well.
[01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:48.220]  The message goes on to say,
[01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:49.900]  anyways, I will keep this short.
[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:52.060]  I work at a commercial scale cultivation site,
[01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:55.540]  and we have been fighting powdery mildew for a year now
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:56.660]  and would love some help.
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:59.020]  We have sprayed fucking everything,
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:00.540]  and I'm starting to tap out.
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:03.100]  It's indoor, and it's in the desert.
[01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:03.940]  Any thoughts?
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:05.840]  And then he signs it, thanks, and then his name.
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:07.140]  I'm not sure if he wants everybody.
[01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:07.980]  Oh, he does.
[01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:09.180]  He says, P.S., you can say my name.
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:10.180]  We out here.
[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:12.780]  So thanks, Matthias585 on Instagram.
[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:16.780]  It's M-A-T-H-I-U-S-585 on Instagram.
[01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:19.300]  Follow him if you want to.
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:20.340]  All right, let's talk a little bit
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:22.440]  about your powdery mildew situation.
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.340]  There are a lot of things we can spray
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:27.420]  and things we can do to help treat and correct this problem,
[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:30.260]  but what I'm mainly concerned with is why is it there?
[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.780]  How did it show up in the first place,
[01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:33.460]  and is it going to come back?
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.920]  Since you say you've sprayed fucking everything,
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:39.020]  it makes me think that you have issues
[01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:40.500]  with the room, obviously.
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:41.780]  There is not enough airflow.
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:43.580]  You're not getting rid of the old air.
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:45.740]  You're not bringing in enough fresh air.
[01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:48.380]  Possibly there are temperature fluctuations.
[01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:50.140]  There are a lot of things like that
[01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:51.660]  that are going to be causing problems.
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:54.220]  Are you running a hydro grow or a soil grow?
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:56.700]  If it's hydro, you've got a lot of water in there.
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:58.880]  You're going to have to control the temperature.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:01.180]  If it's hydro, you may need to get some chillers
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:03.340]  and cool the water because that'll prevent the water
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:06.260]  from becoming a vapor, which becomes humidity,
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:08.660]  which promotes the powdery mildew.
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:10.380]  If you're running with rockwool cubes,
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:11.900]  you may need to let them dry a little more.
[01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:14.980]  If you're running soil, you may be getting the soil too wet.
[01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:17.780]  How much water is in the grow facility itself?
[01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:20.320]  Do you have water available to evaporate,
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:21.760]  to make condensation in there?
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:23.540]  That's going to help you get powdery mildew.
[01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:25.620]  Too much moisture, too much water.
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:26.600]  You said you're in the desert,
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:28.380]  so too much moisture, too much water.
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:29.220]  The outside is hot.
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:30.180]  The inside's real moisture,
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:32.140]  creating a bubble filled with humidity in there,
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:34.460]  and that's going to contribute to your powdery mildew.
[01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:37.500]  So you need heavy dehumidification in that room.
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:40.140]  You need to get that old, hot, stale air out.
[01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:41.620]  You need to get some fresh air in.
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:43.680]  You need some ventilation.
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:45.740]  Hopefully you're treating the air that's coming in.
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:47.380]  That's something we should talk about.
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:48.940]  You need to get that old, stale air out.
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:50.980]  Stale air out, of course,
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:52.700]  but there's fresh air coming in.
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:55.500]  That fresh air coming in does need to be treated.
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:59.660]  You need a filter, and also they make a UV light
[01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:01.780]  that is very good at killing powdery mildew.
[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:04.260]  It will kill any spores that come in.
[01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:06.980]  They make a light that goes over your ducting.
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:09.220]  The intake ducting comes in,
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:11.380]  and then this light shines through the ducting,
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:13.060]  and everything that passes through that duct
[01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:14.940]  is basically killed.
[01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:17.620]  So I would use HEPA filters on all of the intakes,
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:20.460]  and I would use the UV lighting
[01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:23.700]  on all of the venting and ducting if you can.
[01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:25.540]  If you can pass all of the air through one thing
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:28.060]  and run a UV light over it, that would be ideal.
[01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:29.980]  They sell things called clean lights.
[01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:32.080]  They are UV lights that are designed for gardens.
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:34.180]  They're mostly used in the strawberry industry
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:37.540]  because strawberries get a lot of powdery mildew on them.
[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:39.380]  They sell handheld versions of these lights
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:41.380]  that you can actually walk around the crop
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:43.380]  and shine this light over the entire crop,
[01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:45.140]  and you just run it over.
[01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:46.700]  Just basically you want to illuminate
[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:48.500]  every inch of the canopy
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:50.460]  for about a half a second to two seconds.
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:51.300]  So you just wave your hand.
[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:52.380]  I'm waving my hand over it right now
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:53.860]  like you guys can see what I'm doing,
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:55.360]  but it's basically the same motion you make
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:56.200]  when you're watering.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:57.140]  You know, you just move your hand around,
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:59.620]  blah, blah, blah, back and forth like a windshield wiper.
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:00.620]  You do that with this light,
[01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:02.220]  and you walk over the canopy
[01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:04.660]  and just make sure that the light shines on every leaf,
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:07.100]  and that light kills the powdery mildew.
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.060]  It takes several applications of that light
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:11.060]  to get rid of powdery mildew if you already have it,
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:13.340]  but if you're persistent with it, that will help.
[01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:15.820]  So the room needs to be corrected.
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:17.860]  There may be some water issues.
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:20.660]  You may need some equipment, some dehumidification.
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:22.140]  You need some air exchange.
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:23.620]  Temperature control is huge.
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:24.980]  You can't have huge swings.
[01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:27.300]  Huge temperature swings in the night and in the day
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:30.100]  are going to cause powdery mildew issues.
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:31.980]  So that's what I think about the room.
[01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:33.820]  Let's talk about the plants.
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:35.220]  How far apart are your plants?
[01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:36.400]  Are they touching?
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:39.080]  If the plant leaves are laying on top of each other
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:40.100]  in that little space,
[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:42.080]  imagine if we're sitting in a room
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:43.980]  and I just put my hand on,
[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:45.260]  this sounds disgusting to me,
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:47.380]  but what if I just put my hand on your leg?
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:50.360]  In my hot hand, I'm 96 degrees or whatever I am,
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:52.220]  my hand is just sitting on your leg.
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:53.420]  In about 20 or 30 minutes,
[01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:55.220]  there's going to be a hot, sweaty spot there.
[01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:57.620]  Just from our body parts touching and getting warm,
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:56:59.180]  there's going to be a little bit of sweat in there.
[01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:01.240]  That sweat that those plants create
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:02.440]  will cause powdery mildew
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:03.920]  right there between those two leaves
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.080]  and it'll start spreading from there rapidly.
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:10.880]  So something you can really help, defoliate heavily.
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:13.040]  When I'm in a large commercial facility,
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:16.040]  we spend days just defoliating.
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:18.000]  Sometimes it'll be defoliation day.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.560]  Guys get super stoned on your break
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:20.400]  because when you come back,
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.700]  all you're doing is pulling leaves for the next eight hours.
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:25.660]  Just pluck every leaf with a PDL out of that room.
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:27.660]  If you're, I'm not sure if you're the manager,
[01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:29.340]  if you're the boss or if you're the owner,
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:30.940]  but if you are able to,
[01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:33.000]  pull every leaf that you can out of there.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.180]  Those leaves are where the powdery mildew happens.
[01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:36.900]  Get it out of there.
[01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:38.380]  So that's what you can do for the plant.
[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:41.460]  Spread them out, kind of take off all the big leaves,
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:43.420]  put some air on them, fan them around.
[01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:45.020]  If the powdery mildew can't develop
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:47.100]  because it's blown around too much, it can't develop.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:49.180]  If the humidity doesn't stay stagnant,
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:52.260]  the powdery mildew will have a harder time developing.
[01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:55.900]  So let's talk about, you said you've sprayed everything.
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:57.400]  I bet your plants look pissed off.
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:00.040]  They got powdery mildew and you're spraying them with stuff
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:01.560]  and they're trying to fight the powdery mildew
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:03.320]  and then they're getting shit sprayed on them frequently.
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:04.160]  I bet they're getting mad.
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:06.480]  I bet you're getting frustrated as hell.
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:07.400]  Stay positive, bro.
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:09.080]  We're going to beat this shit.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.360]  I'm curious what you've sprayed
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:14.600]  because sometimes your sprays are going to add more moisture.
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:16.080]  It's gonna add more humidity.
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:17.680]  I've sprayed commercial rooms thinking,
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:19.200]  yay, I just got rid of powdery mildew.
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:20.160]  And I came back the next day
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:22.080]  and the powdery mildew was actually thicker,
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:23.400]  drove me fucking nuts.
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:25.080]  So like I'm saying, you gotta fix the room.
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:26.500]  You have to spread the plants apart.
[01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:28.540]  If you've got a bunch of water on the floor,
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:30.160]  squeegee and chop back that shit up,
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:31.460]  get rid of that extra water.
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:32.760]  So let's talk about sprays.
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:33.820]  What have you sprayed?
[01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:35.020]  I'm really curious.
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:39.380]  There is a product called Big Time Exterminator
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:42.620]  that I have heard works wonders on powdery mildew.
[01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:44.520]  It's organic and it is,
[01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:45.700]  okay, here's something I should mention.
[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:47.500]  In Colorado, we are very limited
[01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:49.160]  on products that we can use.
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:51.540]  A lot of people will say, go get a bottle of Eagle 20
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:53.600]  and spray that shit right on your plants.
[01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:56.100]  Eagle 20 will get rid of your powdery mildew.
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:57.540]  It may take one application,
[01:58:57.540 --> 01:58:58.780]  it may take two applications,
[01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:01.580]  but your powdery mildew will be gone for 30 days,
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:04.340]  maybe 45 to 60 days guaranteed.
[01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:06.700]  I personally do not like Eagle 20.
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.620]  There are a lot of deadly, dangerous,
[01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:10.140]  shitty chemicals in there
[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:12.940]  that we do not need to spray on our plants
[01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:15.880]  that we are going to call medicine to give to sick people.
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:17.940]  I do not recommend Eagle 20.
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:20.900]  In Colorado, Eagle 20 is completely banned.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:23.000]  We are not allowed to use it in a recreational
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:24.840]  or a medical facility that is regulated
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:27.400]  by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:28.920]  It is a banned product.
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:30.560]  I like that some products are banned.
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:33.160]  It keeps us safe, it keeps our growers safe,
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:35.320]  it keeps the consumers safe.
[01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:36.480]  We haven't done enough research
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:37.560]  on a lot of these chemicals
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:40.560]  to know what's going to happen to us if we smoke it.
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:42.280]  And a lot of these things affect your body
[01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:46.300]  in a way that, say I spray my plants with Eagle 20 today
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.540]  and we let them flower, we harvest them, we cut them down,
[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:51.120]  that's probably 50 to 60 days,
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:53.200]  you let them dry, you smoke it.
[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:55.520]  There's probably still Eagle 20 on those buds.
[01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:56.600]  When I smoke it,
[01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:58.400]  I don't think I'm going to notice anything right away.
[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:01.320]  I may get a funky taste, my throat may burn, but that's it.
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:03.060]  But I'm thinking that in like 10 years
[02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:04.840]  is when I'm going to notice the fuck up from that.
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:07.680]  I'm going to get a twitch, my left eye is going to pop out.
[02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:08.760]  I'm going to talk funny.
[02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:11.340]  I might get a limp or even a bigger fear.
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:15.480]  Maybe it does something to my DNA or my RNA and my,
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:17.860]  I don't plan on having any more kids, but maybe you do.
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:19.760]  Maybe it'll fuck up your RNA and your DNA
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:22.080]  and your kids will come out with three arms or three eyes
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:25.600]  or one foot or 14 toes, you know?
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:27.280]  So we don't know enough about what these,
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:29.720]  these chemicals kill mildews and they kill bugs.
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:32.680]  So it's doing something biologically or something.
[02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:34.000]  It depends on what kind of chemical you're using,
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:34.820]  but it's doing something.
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:36.040]  And it could be getting into your body
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:37.840]  and fucking up your body by smoking it.
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:39.560]  So we need to be really careful.
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:42.040]  I know I got way off topic, just kind of on a rant there,
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:44.640]  but if you want to spray Eagle 20, go on there,
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:46.560]  hit that shit with Eagle 20, problem solved.
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:47.900]  You got a little bit of time to figure out
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:50.280]  how to fix the rooms and then hopefully you can fix it again
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:52.320]  and not ever have to use the Eagle 20 again.
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:54.680]  I don't recommend that shit, you guys, at all,
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:55.820]  at all, at all.
[02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:58.000]  Things that we are allowed to use in Colorado,
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.880]  a product called Big Time Exterminator.
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:02.800]  It's mostly citrus oil or citrus.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:04.200]  It's citrus something, I think it's citrus oil,
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:05.920]  mostly citrus oil extract.
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:08.320]  It sounds like, smells like oranges.
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:09.840]  It's got a nice like lemony smell,
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:11.680]  orangey smell, citrusy smell to it.
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:13.560]  I mixed that up.
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:17.120]  I think I put, I did, whatever the bucket says,
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:18.800]  there's ingredients on the bucket.
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:21.520]  Go the heavy route, mix it up with some water,
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:23.020]  spray that right on the plants
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:26.440]  and that stuff should calm down the powdery mildew.
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:28.760]  You may have to go for a few applications of that.
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:30.920]  That'll take care of your powdery mildew.
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:34.840]  Another product that I have seen work on powdery mildew
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:38.600]  is 30% hydrogen peroxide.
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:43.000]  I saw a guy put 50 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.920]  in a five gallon bucket and sprayed that directly.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:49.040]  He adjusted the pH and then sprayed that directly
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:51.600]  onto the entire crop and you could kind of see
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:54.560]  the hydrogen peroxide break down the powdery mildew.
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:57.720]  He sprayed the entire crop and then he went ahead
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:00.880]  and sprayed the entire room, sprayed everything down.
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.680]  Everything smelled like hydrogen peroxide.
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:04.040]  It smelled super clean in there.
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:06.000]  It took several applications.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.760]  I think he was going at it daily,
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:10.480]  but by the end of a week, the powdery mildew was gone.
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:14.000]  So you can use PM wash, you can use hydrogen peroxide,
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:15.880]  you can use, oh sorry, I didn't say PM wash.
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:18.600]  There's a product called PM wash, which I haven't used it,
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:19.880]  but I've read great things about it.
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:22.800]  The PM wash should wash the powdery mildew
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:24.520]  off of your plants.
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:27.560]  So peroxide, PM wash, and big time exterminator
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:29.080]  are three products that you can buy.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:30.920]  You can order them over the internet.
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:33.560]  You can probably buy them at your local growth stores.
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:36.320]  Those products, I'm told, will get rid
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:37.600]  of your powdery mildew.
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:39.600]  I have seen the hydrogen peroxide do it.
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:41.240]  I've seen the big time exterminator do it.
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:42.640]  It'll take multiple applications.
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:44.320]  You have to be persistent.
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:45.560]  You have to pay attention to the plants.
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:48.000]  They're gonna need a little bit of love after this.
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.720]  If you're gonna spray them for several days
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:51.520]  with a product like big time exterminator
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:54.480]  or hydrogen peroxide, I recommend give them a day of rest
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:57.920]  and then spray them with Push from our friends at Vegbloom.
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:02:59.720]  They do not pay me to talk about their products,
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:01.600]  but Push is an amazing product.
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:02.600]  It's a foliar product.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:03.440]  It's a little hard to get.
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:05.200]  It's a little bit expensive,
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:06.840]  but oh my God, it's worth every penny.
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:08.400]  And if you're gonna do this much damage
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:09.880]  and this much beating up to your plants,
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:11.960]  I think Push would be really helpful.
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:13.360]  Another product I can recommend
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.600]  is a product called Stilett Oil.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:17.360]  Stilett Oil is not allowed to be used
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:20.720]  in a recreational or a commercial facility in Colorado,
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:21.960]  but I have used it myself
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:24.640]  and it did take care of everything.
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:27.320]  Stilett Oil is an oil that coats your plant
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:30.160]  and it will not allow the powdery mildew
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:31.120]  to grow on the plant.
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:33.840]  It will not allow fungus nets to gather on the plant.
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:36.000]  It won't let mites get on the bottom side of the plant.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.520]  Nothing wants anything to do with Stilett Oil.
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:39.760]  The problem with Stilett Oil
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:42.520]  is it strips the cuticles off your plant leaves
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:43.920]  and it leaves them really vulnerable
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.680]  and they look a little leathery.
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:47.720]  They get kind of sad at you about it.
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:49.760]  If you're going to use Stilett Oil,
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:52.160]  I would, if your plants are small enough,
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:55.120]  I would dunk the plants into a Stilett Oil,
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:55.960]  dilute it heavily.
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:56.960]  Don't go straight into the oil.
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:57.960]  Sorry, let me say that.
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:59.120]  Mix up some Stilett Oil.
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:01.320]  I cannot think of the dilution recommendations,
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:02.440]  but it is on the bottle.
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:03.720]  Go light.
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:06.240]  Dunk the plant into the Stilett Oil.
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:07.280]  Get every leaf in there.
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:08.320]  Give it a good wiggle.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:09.480]  Pull it out.
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.120]  Set it back in the grow area.
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:12.040]  Turn off the lights.
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:13.400]  Let it dry.
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:14.240]  Give it about an hour.
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:15.720]  Let all of the plants dry after you've dunked everything
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:17.080]  and then go back with the sprayer
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:19.600]  and hose off every single plant.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:21.240]  The Stilett Oil will dry and coat
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:23.720]  and then you just want to kind of rinse off the excess
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:26.080]  and all of your powdery mildew and bugs
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:28.760]  should be removed within the first application.
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:30.520]  Stilett Oil will fuck your plants up.
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:31.440]  If they're not strong,
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.120]  it's going to beat the shit out of them.
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:34.320]  Maybe test a couple of plants
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:37.000]  because it does beat your plants up heavily,
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.200]  but it will work.
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.880]  I had almost forgotten about the Stilett Oil.
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.840]  Where are you located, man?
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:44.400]  I've got a huge bottle of JMS Stilett Oil
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:46.720]  that I do not think I'm going to use.
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:48.520]  If you're near me, we can work out a deal.
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:51.040]  Just fucking, I want to see what happens when you use it.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:52.360]  Let's see, where am I now?
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:54.520]  Another thing that we can talk about,
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.600]  our friend Frosty Organics was on the podcast
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:04:57.600]  quite a while back
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:01.400]  and he talked about lactic acid bacteria spray.
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:03.040]  Frosty taught us that he can make his own
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:05.600]  lactic acid bacteria spray and apply it to the plants
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:07.440]  and he says that one application
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:10.040]  will remove his powdery mildew issue.
[02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:11.160]  I'm not sure how well that works.
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:12.560]  I've not tried it myself,
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:15.400]  but I do trust the shit out of Frosty Organics.
[02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:18.360]  So if you want to learn about lactic acid bacteria
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:20.480]  and how to treat your cannabis plants with it,
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:24.920]  you can Google lactic acid bacteria and then powdery mildew
[02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:27.080]  and then there will be the word Clackamas in there.
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:28.840]  Clackamas is a city in Oregon.
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:30.320]  There's a guy named Clackamas Coot
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:32.320]  who is from that part of Oregon
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:35.480]  who wrote an article about making lactic acid bacteria
[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:36.600]  to treat for powdery mildew.
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:40.040]  If you Google it, it should not be too hard to find.
[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:42.640]  Guys, something else I want to mention
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:46.200]  in professional horticultural applications and environments,
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:48.280]  what is commonly used for powdery mildew
[02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:50.520]  is a product called potassium bicarbonate.
[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:52.000]  It's available in several different forms.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.360]  From what I read,
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:55.000]  they say that it mixes up very much
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.840]  like a baking soda in water
[02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:59.040]  and you apply that to your plants as a foliar spray
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:02.520]  and that disrupts the pH on the surface of the leaf,
[02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:04.480]  which will get rid of your powdery mildew
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:06.300]  and it is a horticultural standard.
[02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:08.360]  It's what they use in large greenhouses
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:09.360]  for large production.
[02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:11.800]  Potassium bicarbonate, from what I read,
[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:15.360]  it comes in a very powdery form that's like baking soda.
[02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:17.580]  They say it's available in other forms.
[02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:18.420]  Check that out.
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:20.280]  Maybe that's something that'll help you out.
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:21.320]  If you're in a commercial grow,
[02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:22.820]  I'm not sure if that will be legal,
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:24.880]  so make sure you check out all of the laws.
[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:25.940]  I don't know where you are.
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:27.760]  I don't know the rules.
[02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:30.760]  Everything I say needs to be researched before you apply it.
[02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:33.980]  Another thing that people are going to recommend for you
[02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:35.200]  for your powdery mildew issue,
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:38.660]  people are going to say to hang a sulfur burner in the grow
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:41.560]  and run the sulfur burner for an hour or 45 minutes
[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:43.140]  every few hours or something like that.
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:45.660]  Everyone's going to have their own recipe.
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:47.440]  I highly advise against this, you guys.
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:49.460]  I do not like a sulfur burner.
[02:06:49.460 --> 02:06:51.140]  There was a dispensary in Colorado.
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:52.980]  I will not call them out.
[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:54.180]  They were in Denver.
[02:06:54.180 --> 02:06:56.240]  They were a very, very well-known dispensary.
[02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:58.340]  They had a very well-known breeder working with them
[02:06:58.340 --> 02:07:01.300]  who actually left and started his own thing.
[02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:03.980]  That facility was having a powdery mildew issue
[02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:07.140]  and their solution was to run a sulfur burner.
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:10.020]  The results were for about six months,
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:12.020]  every time you would shop at that dispensary,
[02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:16.140]  everything would have, at first it was a flavor of sulfur.
[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:16.980]  You would smoke it and you'd be like,
[02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:18.540]  why does this taste weird?
[02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:19.380]  And it was sulfur.
[02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:20.200]  You want somebody would say,
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:21.100]  I think there's a sulfur burner.
[02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:23.700]  Your brain would go, oh yeah, it totally tastes like sulfur.
[02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:24.940]  So it was really strong at first.
[02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:26.260]  And over a few months, it faded out,
[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:27.900]  but you could taste it for a long time.
[02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:29.560]  They've gotten rid of the sulfur burner.
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:30.600]  They've corrected their problem.
[02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:31.880]  Now it doesn't happen,
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:34.100]  but that's why you don't run a sulfur burner in there.
[02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:37.900]  It will make your plants taste like shit.
[02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:39.460]  So don't do the sulfur burner.
[02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:42.180]  That's not something I would recommend.
[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:44.980]  Something that you can do that may help you.
[02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:46.940]  I'm not sure if you're using mother plants
[02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:47.980]  or if you're taking plants,
[02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:50.460]  taking cuts from your vegging plants or how that works.
[02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:53.940]  But when you were taking clones, I recommend dunking them.
[02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:56.540]  I cut my clone from the mother plant.
[02:07:56.540 --> 02:08:00.260]  I put them in a cup with water and a small bit of nutrients.
[02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:02.580]  And then I carry that cup filled with cuttings
[02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:04.900]  to another area where they are trimmed up.
[02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:06.900]  And then they are dunked into a solution
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:08.420]  and then they are dipped and then stuck
[02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:12.060]  into either the cloner, if I'm working at one facility,
[02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:14.300]  or they're put into plugs, if I'm at another facility,
[02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:16.140]  or they're put in a rock wool at another facility.
[02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:17.100]  It just depends on where I'm working
[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:19.340]  and who I'm working with and what I got going on.
[02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:20.540]  But after the cut,
[02:08:20.540 --> 02:08:23.140]  I like to dunk the freshly cut clone and trimmed up.
[02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:25.420]  You cut off the leaves, you trim off all the extra.
[02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:27.460]  Then I dunk that right into something.
[02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:29.940]  I will change my product up.
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:32.140]  Sometimes I use banish.
[02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:34.620]  Sometimes I will use the,
[02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:36.060]  what's it called, the big time exterminator.
[02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:37.460]  You guys, I wrote down BTE,
[02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:39.140]  and I can always forget that that stands
[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:40.620]  for big time exterminator.
[02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:42.860]  Sometimes I'll mix up the hydrogen peroxide.
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:44.900]  Just depends on what's available and what I'm treating for,
[02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:47.500]  what I think I may be at risk for.
[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:49.420]  But we know that powdery mildew is the problem here.
[02:08:49.420 --> 02:08:52.820]  So mix up a little bit of hydrogen peroxide in your water.
[02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:54.220]  I just use a five gallon bucket.
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:58.020]  Anywhere between 30 and 70 mils of hydrogen peroxide
[02:08:58.020 --> 02:08:59.940]  usually seems to work for me.
[02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:02.300]  Cut the clone, dunk that right into the five gallon bucket
[02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:04.900]  of hydrogen peroxide, give it a nice hefty shake,
[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:08.140]  and then put that into the Dip and Grow or the Clonex
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:10.380]  or whatever we're using, wherever the hell we are.
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:13.060]  And then stick that right into the cloner,
[02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:14.260]  whatever I'm going into.
[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:16.700]  And then I know that I killed all of the powdery mildew
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:17.860]  so that I've got a fresh start
[02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:20.540]  so that that clone can root and have a healthy start.
[02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:23.260]  Then as soon as it roots and it gets put into its first pot,
[02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:24.340]  I'll spray it with something.
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:28.100]  And then every, I'll spray it once a week with something.
[02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:31.980]  And then if I see powdery mildew, or here's a hint,
[02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:34.420]  a little bit before powdery mildew starts,
[02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:36.540]  you will see little tiny bumps pop up.
[02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:40.060]  The leaf may start to just get a little bit bumpy.
[02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:41.020]  I don't even know how to,
[02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:42.860]  it just looks like a little pimple or a wart
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:44.540]  or something funky coming up on the leaf,
[02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:45.780]  but it's real small.
[02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:47.060]  So if you start seeing that,
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:48.260]  then it's time to start treating
[02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:49.860]  for powdery mildew extra strong.
[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:53.180]  Get out your UV clean light, get out your hydrogen peroxide,
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:55.160]  get out the PM wash, the big time exterminator,
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:58.600]  the lactic acid bacteria, the potassium bicarbonate,
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:09:59.440]  something like that.
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:01.500]  Get it out there, start treating those plants
[02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:03.480]  because you're gonna see the powdery mildew.
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:04.320]  But if I see that,
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.840]  that's when I start stepping up my game,
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:07.440]  going a little bit harder.
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:10.060]  One more thing I should mention is the powdery mildew
[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:11.600]  could be on your clothes.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:13.520]  You're carrying it around from the flower room
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:16.280]  to the bedroom, to the mother room, to the clone room.
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:17.800]  It's in your air conditioning ducts.
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:19.040]  It's in your HVAC system.
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:20.280]  It is everywhere.
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:21.640]  It needs to be taken care of.
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:23.200]  It needs to be treated.
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:24.880]  If you've got those silly ducts
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:27.200]  that have the insulation inside of them,
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:28.480]  tear that shit out of there.
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:30.640]  I know that could be a multi-thousand dollar job
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:31.800]  for your facility,
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:34.960]  but all of that insulation inside of there is harboring,
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:36.440]  harboring, that was a hard word to say.
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:39.320]  The insulation is harboring powdery mildew
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:42.160]  and it will eventually be a place for bugs to hide out
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:43.480]  once one gets in there.
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:46.440]  Just takes two and those bugs will start a party.
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:47.280]  It'll be disgusting.
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:48.760]  So you can have the powdery mildew on your clothes.
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:50.720]  Make sure everybody's changing clothes properly.
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:53.560]  I bet you've got a grower that has a private grow at home
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:55.520]  and he's got powdery mildew also.
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:57.880]  And as soon as he starts getting rid of powdery mildew,
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:10:59.160]  you get it worse.
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:00.360]  And then as soon as your facility
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:02.200]  starts getting it cleaned up, he gets it worse.
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:04.160]  And you guys are just passing that shit back and forth
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:05.600]  and it's never gonna go away.
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:09.640]  So start changing your clothes, get some dedicated clothes,
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:11.920]  dedicated shoes, a dedicated hat.
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:14.680]  If you've got long hair or dreadlocks, get it wrapped up,
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:16.120]  get it in a hat, get it covered up.
[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:18.520]  You guys, I'm always going and re-tucking my dreads
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:20.440]  because I try to keep everything covered up.
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:23.000]  I don't want dragging my dreads along around the grow.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:23.840]  I think it's gross.
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:24.760]  I don't need to be picking up bugs
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:26.560]  or leaving hair in the flowers.
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:28.680]  Just keep your dreads and your hair covered up.
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:30.440]  If you've got a big man, look beard,
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:33.360]  or if you've got a hipster beard, cover that shit up too.
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:35.360]  Just try to be clean, you guys.
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:37.320]  Another thing I really wanna recommend,
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:38.840]  I did work in a facility
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:40.400]  that was riddled with powdery mildew.
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:41.920]  I won't call them out on a podcast.
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:43.000]  Most of my friends and listeners
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:44.160]  know who the fuck I'm talking about.
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:46.960]  The place was riddled with powdery mildew.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:48.840]  They fired a grower, I took over.
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:49.680]  I walked in and I said,
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:51.800]  well, you've got bugs and powdery mildew to start with.
[02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:53.520]  And they're like, yes, we do, help us.
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:54.620]  I tried to get rid of it, you guys,
[02:11:54.620 --> 02:11:56.600]  but being MED regulated,
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:59.880]  I understand the struggle that my listener here has.
[02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:01.400]  It was a pain in the ass.
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:03.120]  Everybody in that grow got sick
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:04.120]  because of the powdery mildew.
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:05.000]  The mildew's gone, you guys.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.800]  It took two or three crops,
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:08.640]  two or three crop cycles to get rid of it.
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:10.200]  But the powdery mildew was actually gone.
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:12.160]  We got rid of it in a 100-light facility.
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:13.380]  The PM was gone.
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:14.220]  You could not see it.
[02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:15.040]  You could not smell it.
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:16.040]  You could not taste it.
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:16.880]  It was cleaned up.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.280]  They did their job, they got rid of it.
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:22.560]  But everybody kind of got a sinus sort of thing.
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:24.320]  Everybody showed different symptoms,
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:25.900]  but everybody could agree that it was messing up
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:29.120]  their noses, their throat, and their eye region.
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:30.160]  So wear a mask.
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:32.120]  If you've got a ventilator, a respirator,
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:34.620]  or even one of those just shitty little paper
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:36.200]  Asian bird flu masks,
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:37.040]  just wear one of those
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:38.360]  when you're working with the powdery mildew
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:40.440]  because you don't want to get sick from it.
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:43.640]  I tried to deny that I was sick from the powdery mildew,
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:45.880]  but once it was gone, I felt better.
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:48.920]  And I could tell that my allergy problem
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:50.440]  and my throat thing was happening
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:51.800]  because of that powdery mildew.
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:52.640]  That's what was doing it.
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:54.600]  So please take care of yourself.
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:57.800]  If the plants are bad powdery mildewy,
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:00.320]  you have to think about if you want to release
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:02.280]  that product to the public
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:04.860]  because you don't want to be responsible
[02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:06.320]  for making people sick.
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:08.840]  So that's a moral thing you're going to have
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:10.180]  to think about yourself.
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:13.520]  Something that they do allow here in Colorado,
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:17.520]  they will let you blast the powdery mildew buds.
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:20.960]  The marijuana enforcement division has decided
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:24.840]  that it is safe to put powdery mildew buds
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:27.120]  and trim into a tube and run butane over it
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:32.120]  and turn it in to a BHO, a hash, dabs, shatter, wax.
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.800]  It turns into distillate eventually.
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:38.320]  It gets put into edibles eventually.
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.120]  So yeah, they're deeming it safe.
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:42.560]  So if that's what you want to do with it, do that.
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:43.960]  That's the best I can recommend with it.
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:46.500]  But honestly, if it's coated in powdery mildew,
[02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:47.340]  think about this.
[02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:49.960]  My friend Doug is getting old and Doug's got a lung problem.
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:53.040]  And when Doug smokes regular cannabis, he coughs.
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:55.280]  When Doug smokes cannabis that's got something on it,
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:57.880]  he coughs a lot and gets really sick.
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:13:59.720]  Doug is smoking because he's sick
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:01.920]  and trying to prolong and save his life.
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:04.680]  We do not want to give Doug powdery mildews
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:07.880]  and mycotoxins and funky shit for his lungs
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:09.760]  to kill him more quickly.
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:10.600]  I love Doug.
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:12.360]  I fucking want him here.
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:14.520]  Treat everybody like Doug, okay?
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:15.880]  Everybody that's getting cannabis
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:17.400]  is my friend Doug in my mind.
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:19.880]  We all have to take care of all of our patients
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:21.200]  like they are Doug.
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:22.120]  All right.
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.820]  Doug is a real dude, but I kind of exaggerated his story.
[02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:26.240]  Doug's not that sick, you guys.
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:27.560]  Just wanted to use him as an example
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:28.960]  because he's a good dude.
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:29.800]  All right.
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:31.320]  I hope I've given you some information
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:33.980]  that kind of teaches you how to at least control
[02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:35.760]  and harness and get rid of this powdery mildew.
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:37.420]  I'm not sure what you can do where you are.
[02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:39.600]  So you can spray any of these products
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:40.600]  that you choose to spray.
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:41.960]  You can defoliate.
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:43.720]  Things that I fully recommend you do
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:46.640]  are get the old air out, the fresh air in,
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:48.920]  dehumidify, do some filtration.
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:51.160]  Also space out the plants a little bit.
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:52.920]  Make sure they aren't touching each other
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:55.280]  and then control temperature swings.
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:56.420]  You're in the desert
[02:14:56.420 --> 02:14:58.400]  and you're putting a bunch of water inside of a building.
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:14:59.720]  You're making, excuse me,
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:01.540]  you're making a big Tupperware dish
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:03.400]  and you're making a giant comb dome
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:04.220]  is what you're doing in there.
[02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:07.260]  So you need to evacuate the humidity
[02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:09.320]  and get that out of the room.
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:10.660]  Don't be afraid to throw away some plants
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:11.680]  if they're starting to get too bad.
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:13.240]  I know that sounds terrible
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:14.060]  in a commercial production facility.
[02:15:14.060 --> 02:15:14.900]  I've been there before.
[02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:17.560]  Trust me, I have dealt with what you're dealing with.
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:18.900]  Some days it makes you want to punch yourself
[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:21.020]  straight in the face, but I did an episode
[02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:23.940]  a few episodes back called Stay Positive.
[02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:25.520]  And if you didn't have powdery mildew,
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:26.920]  you wouldn't be getting so many hours.
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:27.880]  Should it be too easy?
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:28.720]  Wouldn't be a challenge.
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:29.760]  Wouldn't be fun anymore.
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:31.720]  So you got to go through some struggles.
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:33.740]  And that way, when those issues are gone,
[02:15:33.740 --> 02:15:35.240]  it's going to be like you're fucking cruising
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:36.680]  in the coolest damn facility ever.
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:37.600]  And you'll appreciate it.
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:38.420]  That's what I think.
[02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:39.260]  Stay positive.
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:40.080]  Don't put your hair out.
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:41.400]  Don't put yourself in the face, keep growing.
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:42.960]  And dude, if you have any more questions,
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.120]  please send me an email.
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:46.160]  If anybody out there has any questions
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:48.600]  about growing cannabis, about smoking cannabis,
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:50.640]  about anything cannabis related,
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:51.560]  I would love to hear from you.
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:55.080]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:56.320]  I'm easy to get ahold of.
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:58.720]  I'm trying to catch up and answer all of the emails
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:00.200]  and do episodes about all of them,
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:02.080]  but I honestly get so many that it's hard to keep up,
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:04.440]  but I'm getting to your email.
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:06.440]  A lot of people have asked for episodes
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:09.840]  about beneficial insects and pesticide management
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:12.440]  or pest management and identification of problems
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:13.280]  in the garden.
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:14.120]  I am working on that.
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:15.440]  That's going to be a long episode.
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:16.860]  I may do it in multiple parts.
[02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:18.960]  I've got several pages written already.
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:20.480]  I'm still working on that one.
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:21.640]  I've got an episode coming up
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:23.800]  about seasonal effectiveness disorder
[02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:25.720]  or seasonal effective disorder.
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:27.200]  Since it has been winter time here,
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:29.240]  I want to talk a little bit about that
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:30.840]  because I've got a bunch of great stuff coming up.
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:33.360]  A lot of it has been listener inspired material,
[02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:35.520]  which I truly enjoy bringing to you.
[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:37.560]  Because I've been going for 28 minutes,
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:38.720]  I'm going to wrap up this podcast.
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:40.320]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:42.160]  Big shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.

[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.600]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH Podcast.
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:03.440]  And on Instagram, you guys,
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:06.600]  I post so many photos to Instagram.
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:09.040]  My phone is way overloaded with photography right now.
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:10.880]  So instead of deleting the pictures,
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:12.920]  I just go shoot a bunch of them to Instagram
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:14.680]  about once every two hours or so.
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:16.400]  Whenever I sit down and take a couple dabs,
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:18.200]  I try to shoot a new picture up to Instagram.
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:20.000]  While I edit this podcast and listen back,
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.920]  I'll shoot a couple of pictures to Instagram.
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:23.120]  Follow me on Instagram.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:25.080]  It's Irie underscore genetics.

[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:29.000]  It's my seed company.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:29.840]  I am a seed breeder.
[02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:31.320]  If you aren't aware of that,
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:33.680]  Irie Genetics Colorado is me.
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:35.320]  Make sure you check out our Instagram.
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:37.640]  Lots of great high quality cannabis photography.
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:39.960]  You can see what I'm doing there.
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:42.120]  Once again, if you have a product you'd like me to review,
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:43.720]  or if you've got something you'd like to say,
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:45.400]  or if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:48.080]  send me an email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:49.680]  Let me remind you about Patreon.
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:52.240]  Patreon.com is a service where you can go
[02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:54.720]  and you can financially contribute to the podcast.
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:55.780]  I'm not trying to get rich.
[02:17:55.780 --> 02:17:57.080]  I'm not begging for money.
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:17:59.400]  I'm just trying to offset the cost of my web hosting
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:02.600]  so that I can keep the podcast coming to you for free.
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:04.360]  This podcast will always be free.
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:05.480]  Free freedom.
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:08.300]  I'm simply asking people to help me pay for my website
[02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:10.120]  so that I don't have to pay for it out of my pocket.
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:11.840]  There are a few people that are able to contribute.
[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:12.880]  I truly appreciate it.
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:13.720]  Thank you.
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:15.400]  If you can't contribute, I still appreciate you.
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:16.240]  I still love you.
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:18.400]  Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:19.840]  If you can't contribute financially,
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:21.240]  one thing you can do to help me out,
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:22.240]  you can go to iTunes.
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:23.360]  Go to the iTunes store.
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:25.300]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:26.600]  Find the review section.
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:27.440]  Type in a comment.
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:28.800]  Let me know what you think about the show,
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:31.600]  and I will read your review on a future episode.
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:34.820]  So far, everybody has given me a five-star review.
[02:18:34.820 --> 02:18:37.160]  Give me as many stars as you feel like I deserve,
[02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:39.480]  and I will truly appreciate it.
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:42.000]  You guys, that's all I've got for you this week.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.840]  I was lucky enough to get to see Maddie and Spence
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:45.840]  for a couple of minutes at the Canna Canyon the other day.
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:47.200]  They came to Colorado to visit.
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:48.160]  They invited me up.
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:49.440]  I got to hang out and take some dabs
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:50.960]  and take a picture with Maddie.
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:52.160]  I sure did miss those guys.
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:53.560]  So big shout out to Maddie and Spence,
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:55.920]  and until next time, take a fat dab
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:57.480]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:41.900]  And my tunes were played.
[02:19:41.900 --> 02:20:21.620]  I don't really care.
[02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:59.580]  Let them if your cup is full.
[02:20:59.580 --> 02:21:02.580]  May it be again.
[02:21:02.580 --> 02:21:08.400]  Let it be known there is a fountain.
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:22:24.620]  And first, I will take you home.
[02:22:24.620 --> 02:23:21.640]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:23.360]  It's time for episode number 178
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:25.120]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:28.800]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:29.840]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:31.080]  if you're a professional grower,
[02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:33.520]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:35.320]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:37.880]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:40.360]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:43.040]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeJeff.
[02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:44.840]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[02:23:44.840 --> 02:23:46.880]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:48.520]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:50.880]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:54.680]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:58.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't going to be a long episode.
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:23:59.680]  I'm just coming in for a quickie.
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:01.800]  I'm going to release this on a Thursday.
[02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:05.080]  You're very welcome for a Thursday bonus episode.
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:06.120]  Before I get to the main topic,
[02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:07.960]  I want to do a little bit of bragging.
[02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:09.400]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friends
[02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:10.440]  at Organica.
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:13.280]  Organica is a medical marijuana dispensary
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:14.360]  in the state of New Mexico.
[02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:15.960]  They are located in Albuquerque.
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:17.040]  If you are in Albuquerque
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:19.400]  or a New Mexico medical marijuana patient,
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:21.640]  be sure to visit my friends at Organica
[02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:24.440]  because I bred a strain called Arise.
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:27.480]  Arise is golden goat to daybreaker.
[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:30.400]  These guys at Organica got some seeds
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:31.960]  and they grew the Arise.
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:34.320]  And the Arise has been testing consistently
[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:37.120]  in the high 20s to low 30s.
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:41.240]  Their most recent test tested at 32% THC.
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:46.240]  It was 35.84% THCA and 32% THC.
[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:49.880]  It was tested by my friends at Steep Hill Lab.
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:51.920]  Congratulations and big shout out
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:56.240]  and much thanks and much love to everybody at Organica.
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:58.080]  Shout out to everybody.
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:24:58.920]  Good job, you guys.
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:00.080]  That's fucking amazing.
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:01.640]  Because that means I've got a strain.
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:05.600]  Currently, I hold the highest THCA test
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:07.600]  at Steep Hill Labs with the Arise.
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:09.280]  I did not grow it, but I bred it.
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:10.200]  It means a lot to me.
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:13.080]  That means there's a lot of potential in the Arise
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:15.880]  and a lot of potential in the strains
[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:18.520]  I crossed with the Arise male.
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:20.160]  All right, so big shout out to everybody there.
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:22.520]  Also, shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:24.880]  That's right, if you need some t-shirts, hoodies,
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:26.440]  any sort of clothing printed,
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:29.360]  I highly recommend our friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:31.360]  That's right, handmadeapparel.biz.
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:33.160]  They are members of the cannabis community.
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:34.880]  They are smokers, they are dabbers.
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:37.240]  They are putting together a really cool event right now.
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:38.920]  It is the Borro Derby.
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:42.320]  It will feature dinner, an auction, and borrow.
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:43.800]  I cannot wait to see how it goes.
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:45.480]  I'm really proud of my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:47.520]  If you need something printed, if you need stickers made,
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:49.000]  if you need hat pins made,
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.240]  please contact my friends at handmadeapparel.biz.

[02:25:56.840 --> 02:25:58.160]  Check those guys out.
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:25:59.320]  Truly appreciate them.
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:00.520]  They do great work for the community.
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:02.760]  They printed my Grow From Your Heart hoodies.
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:03.840]  They look super sweet.
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:05.440]  They printed my iRegenetics t-shirts.
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:06.800]  They look super sweet.
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:09.840]  They have printed, they printed the Secret Sesh t-shirts.
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:10.920]  They printed my hat pins.
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:13.600]  You guys, these guys have put in a lot of work for us,
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:15.400]  and I will continue to use them
[02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:17.080]  because I support and respect them.
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:19.400]  Much love to our friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:20.880]  All right, if I want to keep this episode short,
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:22.040]  I need to quit rambling.
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:23.320]  I need to quit bragging.
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:26.040]  Let's move into the main topic of this podcast.
[02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:28.240]  You guys, this podcast is about something called
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:31.520]  seasonal affective disorder, also known as SAD,
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:33.080]  also known as winter depression.
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:36.200]  I want to talk about winter depression and feeling sad
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:39.040]  and ways that some cannabis may help us out with this.
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:42.840]  Why do I want to come up with a podcast about SADs?
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:46.040]  Because lately I have felt this funk in my head.
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:47.840]  I'm blaming it on this weather.
[02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:49.160]  I'm a California person.
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:50.400]  I'm from Southern California.
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:52.720]  I grew up right near the beach, boy.
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:54.000]  Oh yeah, that was fucking stupid, right?
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.320]  But it's okay, because I meant it.
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:56.440]  I'm seriously from the beach.
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:58.160]  I grew up 20 minutes from the beach.
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:26:59.520]  I used to go to Bolsa Chica Beach.
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:00.720]  I used to go to Huntington Beach.
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:02.160]  I used to go to Seal Beach.
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:04.240]  I used to be all over the beach, bro.
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:06.320]  Lifeguard Stand 23 at Bolsa Chica Beach
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:07.240]  used to be the spot.
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:08.240]  It's where the waves are ripping.
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:09.760]  It's where the kids could go do whatever we want.
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:11.320]  It's where the, I was a young kid.
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:13.000]  It was where the older kids could go smoke some dope.
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.600]  The even older kids would drink beer.
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:15.840]  Nobody gave a shit what we did.
[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:16.680]  I'm a beach kid.
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:19.000]  I miss that constant sunshine.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.240]  I miss just that vibe.
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:22.560]  I live in Colorado now.
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:27.360]  In about October, November-ish, it gets fucking cold
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:28.960]  and it gets really dark.
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:31.080]  The days get really short, it feels like.
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:34.000]  I feel like the days didn't get as short in California.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.520]  When the winter comes, the days feel shorter in Colorado.
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:38.920]  That just could be me being older and not being a kid,
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:41.800]  but it's fucking with my head, you guys.
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:43.920]  These dark, cold winter months,
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:46.880]  you can't go outside and do what you'd normally do.
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:47.920]  It's a little slower.
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:49.320]  You gotta get up early for work.
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:50.480]  You gotta defrost the car.
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:51.600]  Joe Rogan put it best.
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:53.520]  Joe Rogan said there are states that are called,
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:56.080]  he calls them the fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck states
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:57.000]  because when you get in your car
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:57.880]  to go to work in the morning,
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:27:59.320]  you spend three or four minutes sitting there going
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:00.440]  fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:02.640]  because you're so cold, your body can't do anything.
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:03.800]  Your stomach muscles tighten up,
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:05.160]  your brain starts twitching,
[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:06.040]  your neck gets all stiff,
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:07.720]  and you just gotta wait for the car to defrost
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:09.600]  and so that you can drive to work.
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:10.880]  That shit sucks.
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:12.160]  Snow drives me crazy.
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:13.000]  I don't like the cold.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:13.840]  I don't like the snow.
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:14.760]  It feels to make me,
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:17.560]  it seems to feel like it makes me weak and slow down.
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:19.320]  It makes my bones and muscles hurt.
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:21.320]  I'm dealing with it.
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:23.280]  I'm not enjoying the winter.
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:24.160]  I've got a lot of good friends.
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:25.800]  I do a lot of cool shit, so don't let it slow me down,
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:27.440]  but I do feel it in the back of my head going, bro,
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:28.400]  something sucks,
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:32.120]  and it's just this seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:33.160]  I wanna talk about a couple things
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:35.920]  that winter depression comes along with,
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:38.280]  and then we'll move into the cannabis part of this.
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:39.280]  I did a little research.
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:41.480]  It says it usually lasts from fall to springish,
[02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:43.920]  so if you're feeling a little funky from fall to spring,
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:45.040]  this is probably why,
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:48.080]  especially if you live in these winter colder climates.
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:50.680]  Some symptoms of this seasonal effective disorder
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:53.080]  include depression, just basic depression.
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:54.800]  It's not your classic depression.
[02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:57.720]  If you are feeling like hurting yourself or somebody else,
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:28:59.000]  or if you've got problems like that,
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.040]  if you're thinking about starting to drink alcohol
[02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:03.680]  or take pills or hurt yourself or cut yourself
[02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:06.200]  or break something or be an asshole to people,
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:08.600]  please get some help.
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:09.560]  Nobody's gonna judge you.
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:10.600]  Nobody's gonna hate you.
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:11.440]  We're gonna love you.
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:12.280]  We're gonna treat you right.
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:14.080]  If you wanna hurt yourself, if you wanna kill yourself,
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:15.520]  please call me.
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:17.080]  Fucking send me a Facebook message.
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:17.920]  We'll talk.
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:19.720]  Call Suicide Prevention Hotline.
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:20.760]  Call somebody.
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:22.560]  We probably don't know each other too personally.
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:24.160]  If you're embarrassed to call somebody, hit me up.
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:25.360]  I don't know you.
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:26.200]  I won't broadcast your business.
[02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:27.400]  We'll talk about why you wanna hurt yourself
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:28.800]  and we'll fix that shit.
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:30.000]  That doesn't need to happen.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  So if you're really depressed, please get some help.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.680]  But if you think you've got some winter seasonal depression,
[02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:36.800]  we can help you with some cannabis suggestions.
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:40.480]  Another symptom here would be some laziness,
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:44.400]  just low energy, lethargy, no desire to get out of bed.
[02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:46.520]  You just wanna lay around, put some blankets over you,
[02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:48.800]  maybe play on your phone and not do a damn thing,
[02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:50.640]  losing interest in life.
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:54.800]  That's sort of an effect of the winter depression here.
[02:29:56.240 --> 02:29:58.120]  A lot of people have no desire to eat
[02:29:58.120 --> 02:30:00.120]  when this winter depression comes on.
[02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:02.240]  But oddly enough, the internet says that people
[02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:05.700]  will seek foods like carbohydrates and such
[02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:07.160]  during the winter, which is odd for me
[02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:08.880]  because I always like carbs.
[02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:10.560]  I like pizza and pasta and shit.
[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:12.080]  But it says that you're gonna seek out
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:14.200]  carbohydrate type salty foods
[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:17.720]  if you are experiencing seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:20.480]  It says you're gonna be agitated and irritable,
[02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:22.640]  which I am there.
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:25.560]  That's partly how I'm noticing this.
[02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:28.280]  I feel more tired, I feel grouchy, I feel fucking annoyed.
[02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:29.800]  And I'm pretty sure that it's mostly
[02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:33.240]  just this seasonal effective disorder.
[02:30:33.240 --> 02:30:35.300]  Another thing that the internet said
[02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:37.520]  that I totally relate to, and this is kind of
[02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:39.120]  what inspired me to wanna talk about this
[02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:43.120]  because it's part of where we are in this new generation,
[02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:44.600]  this new part of life.
[02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:47.840]  They said that this seasonal effectiveness disorder
[02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:50.140]  comes with panic attacks.
[02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:51.980]  And I think there's a reason for these panic attacks
[02:30:51.980 --> 02:30:53.620]  that we're getting now as humans.
[02:30:54.940 --> 02:30:58.740]  We are too attached to our computers and our devices.
[02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:03.740]  And as humans, we have become completely lazy and complacent.
[02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:08.060]  In the winter, I think that there's something inside of me
[02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:11.860]  that gives me this trigger to go hunt and gather food
[02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:14.720]  and build a fire so that I can keep the family warm
[02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:15.560]  through the winter.
[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:18.500]  But now we all have jobs that don't require,
[02:31:18.500 --> 02:31:21.140]  most of us have jobs that don't require that sort of stuff.
[02:31:21.140 --> 02:31:23.980]  I work in a grow, I show up at a grow at six in the morning,
[02:31:23.980 --> 02:31:27.500]  I do grow stuff, I leave there at 6 p.m.,
[02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:29.540]  I come home, I play on my computer,
[02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:31.620]  I live in a house, I drive a car,
[02:31:31.620 --> 02:31:33.540]  my food all comes from a store.
[02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:37.020]  I think that as humans, we were designed and built
[02:31:37.020 --> 02:31:38.820]  to be out there hunting our food.
[02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:40.860]  We should be, I should be out there chasing down deer
[02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:43.820]  or buffalo and killing that shit and dragging it in
[02:31:43.820 --> 02:31:45.660]  and then skinning it and cleaning it.
[02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:47.380]  Yes, I am a vegetarian and I'm saying this.
[02:31:47.380 --> 02:31:48.980]  This is part of why I think humans are fucked up
[02:31:48.980 --> 02:31:50.820]  because we're not doing this.
[02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:51.980]  There's something primal in us
[02:31:51.980 --> 02:31:53.940]  that makes us supposed to do that.
[02:31:53.940 --> 02:31:56.460]  And in the winter, that primal instinct to survive
[02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:59.500]  becomes even stronger because it's harder to survive.
[02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:01.380]  And in the environment where I am,
[02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:03.180]  it's even harder because it snows.
[02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:04.660]  I'm not saying that I'm in the worst conditions,
[02:32:04.660 --> 02:32:06.380]  but I mean, we get snow and it's fucking cold.
[02:32:06.380 --> 02:32:08.220]  And if you don't have shelter and food and warmth,
[02:32:08.220 --> 02:32:10.160]  you will die out there.
[02:32:10.160 --> 02:32:14.720]  So our inside, our instinct, our natural design
[02:32:14.720 --> 02:32:16.780]  is to be hunting and gathering.
[02:32:16.780 --> 02:32:19.540]  And you're supposed to be using energy and adrenaline
[02:32:19.540 --> 02:32:21.100]  and that anger that you feel,
[02:32:21.100 --> 02:32:23.700]  you wouldn't feel that if you were throwing a spear
[02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:25.800]  at another animal so that you could survive.
[02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:27.340]  You wouldn't have time to be angry.
[02:32:27.340 --> 02:32:29.060]  You wouldn't have time to be depressed.
[02:32:29.060 --> 02:32:31.740]  It'd be letting out all that anger through adrenaline,
[02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:33.980]  through hiking, through stalking an animal,
[02:32:33.980 --> 02:32:35.340]  through, or maybe through gardening.
[02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:37.740]  If you were a vegetarian back in the,
[02:32:37.740 --> 02:32:39.340]  whatever times I'm talking about,
[02:32:39.340 --> 02:32:41.500]  maybe you had to spend all of that energy in the garden.
[02:32:41.500 --> 02:32:43.340]  And we're not doing that shit anymore.
[02:32:43.340 --> 02:32:46.280]  We're sitting on computers and we're playing video games
[02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:49.280]  and we're driving up to a window to get our food.
[02:32:49.280 --> 02:32:52.720]  I think a lot of that is kind of what's causing
[02:32:52.720 --> 02:32:54.860]  the winter depression for a lot of the males.
[02:32:54.860 --> 02:32:56.880]  I'm not sure if this affects women the same way.
[02:32:56.880 --> 02:32:57.880]  I'm not trying to be sexist.
[02:32:57.880 --> 02:33:00.080]  I just know it's a testosterone thing.
[02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:02.200]  Maybe women want to be hunters and gatherers also.
[02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:05.680]  Maybe women suffer the seasonal effectiveness disorder
[02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:07.800]  for the same reasons, but differently.
[02:33:07.800 --> 02:33:08.620]  I'm not sure.
[02:33:08.620 --> 02:33:09.460]  This part is my opinion.
[02:33:09.460 --> 02:33:11.160]  The panic attacks and the hunting rant
[02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:13.980]  is all my own opinion here.
[02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:16.260]  But I think we should be using our energy.
[02:33:17.100 --> 02:33:17.940]  And I'm going to start talking about now
[02:33:17.940 --> 02:33:20.380]  about things that we can do to help ourselves
[02:33:20.380 --> 02:33:23.500]  with this seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:26.180]  I already talked about being active.
[02:33:26.180 --> 02:33:28.500]  Exercise, get out there and do something.
[02:33:28.500 --> 02:33:30.140]  I'm hypothetically saying,
[02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:31.260]  I feel like we should be hunting.
[02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:33.580]  We should be chasing down an elk or a deer.
[02:33:33.580 --> 02:33:35.780]  And then we got to kill it with either a spear
[02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:38.100]  or a bow and arrow, a recurve bow.
[02:33:38.100 --> 02:33:39.820]  And you got to go drag that shit back to camp.
[02:33:39.820 --> 02:33:40.700]  And then you got to skin it.
[02:33:40.700 --> 02:33:42.000]  You got to get everything out.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.240]  Then fire.
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:45.900]  I think being around a fire makes me feel really good.
[02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:48.300]  Like a campfire, something inside of a campfire
[02:33:48.300 --> 02:33:51.020]  really fixes me, especially in this cold weather.
[02:33:51.020 --> 02:33:54.000]  So get out there and be active.
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.340]  Build a campfire, go camping,
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:58.860]  go hunting if you're that type of person.
[02:33:58.860 --> 02:33:59.700]  Be physical.
[02:33:59.700 --> 02:34:01.980]  Something I can really recommend to get you out
[02:34:01.980 --> 02:34:05.380]  of a seasonal effective disorder, kind of a funk,
[02:34:05.380 --> 02:34:09.500]  is join some sort of organized martial art or fighting.
[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:11.040]  Be physical, use your body.
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:12.660]  I think a lot of what's causing this
[02:34:12.660 --> 02:34:15.380]  is pent up body energy from the winter.
[02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:17.780]  Get out there and use your body.
[02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:19.660]  Go join a Brazilian jujitsu class.
[02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:20.940]  Go join a martial arts class.
[02:34:20.940 --> 02:34:22.100]  Go be a wrestler.
[02:34:22.100 --> 02:34:24.060]  If you're not into that, go do some yoga.
[02:34:24.060 --> 02:34:26.560]  Just use your body, use some energy.
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:28.720]  I think it'll really help you out.
[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:30.760]  So now let's start talking about,
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:32.180]  before I get to smoking cannabis,
[02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:33.540]  I want to say go for a drive.
[02:34:33.540 --> 02:34:35.140]  Just put on some music and go for a drive.
[02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:38.260]  That always fixes my head when I'm a little bit funky.
[02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:40.380]  Put on your favorite music, some reggae,
[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:41.220]  whatever you're into.
[02:34:41.220 --> 02:34:42.580]  If you're into some metal, put on some metal.
[02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:44.620]  Turn it up a little bit too loud and just go for a drive.
[02:34:44.660 --> 02:34:45.500]  That'll fix your head.
[02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:46.460]  But I wanted to say go for a drive
[02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:48.260]  before I start talking about consuming cannabis
[02:34:48.260 --> 02:34:50.220]  because Mike will flip out if I say smoke a joint.
[02:34:50.220 --> 02:34:52.420]  Go for a drive, it'll make you feel better.
[02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:54.660]  So now let's talk about other things.
[02:34:54.660 --> 02:34:57.680]  Cannabis, this is how cannabis can truly help
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:01.000]  with the seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:04.380]  I think that smoking sativa-dominant cannabis,
[02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:08.300]  either flowers or dabs, are going to help fix your mood.
[02:35:08.300 --> 02:35:10.060]  I've got a short list of strains here
[02:35:10.060 --> 02:35:12.060]  that I have experimented with personally
[02:35:12.060 --> 02:35:14.420]  that I have found to help uplift my mood
[02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:16.620]  and not make me too anxious or jittery
[02:35:16.620 --> 02:35:19.980]  and still allow me to function and get my job done
[02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:21.740]  and still be like a normal person
[02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:22.860]  but still have a nice buzz
[02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:24.900]  and nobody can tell how high I am.
[02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:29.060]  So on this list, number one on this list is Jillybean.
[02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:31.940]  Jillybean has always put me in a good mood.
[02:35:31.940 --> 02:35:33.380]  It's uplifting, it makes me walk
[02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:34.700]  with a nice little pep in my step.
[02:35:34.700 --> 02:35:36.280]  It puts a grin on my face.
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:39.420]  Jillybean will wipe out any anxiety, depression.
[02:35:39.420 --> 02:35:41.580]  It'll calm me down and put you in a good mood.
[02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:43.580]  The next one on that list is Tangy.
[02:35:43.580 --> 02:35:44.660]  Yes, a lot of people are going to say
[02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:46.700]  Jillybean and Tangy are the same thing.
[02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:48.080]  They're very similar strains.
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:49.540]  They have very similar qualities.
[02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:51.460]  They taste very similarly.
[02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:52.580]  They grow similarly.
[02:35:52.580 --> 02:35:55.500]  I think they both put a smile on my face.
[02:35:55.500 --> 02:35:58.940]  The next strain on my list is Tangerine Haze from Soma.
[02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:01.640]  This is actually Soma's New York City Diesel,
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:03.740]  but there's a phenotype that tastes
[02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:06.340]  very tangerine and orangey.
[02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:09.140]  That tangerine haze has always been,
[02:36:09.140 --> 02:36:10.840]  I used to call it my morning breakfast smoke.
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:12.320]  I'd be like, I need my morning oranges
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:14.240]  and I would smoke some Soma's Tangerine Haze
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:16.640]  or his New York City Diesel known as Tangerine Haze.
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:18.520]  So there's a group back in the day
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:21.040]  known as the Devil's Harvest Crew
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:22.340]  and they grew a bunch of stuff
[02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:25.600]  and they found a very orangey phenotype,
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:29.480]  very orangey phenotype of the New York City Soma's Diesel.
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:31.280]  And they passed that around and called it Tangerine Haze.
[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:32.120]  That's where it got the name.
[02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:33.800]  And I found the same phenotype out of a pack
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:35.560]  and I grew it and I loved it.
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:37.080]  And it always used to put a smile on my face.
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:39.940]  So I think those top three that I listed
[02:36:39.940 --> 02:36:43.780]  are very orangey, very citrusy, very sativa,
[02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:45.180]  yet very light strains.
[02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:46.620]  When you smoke them, when I smoke them,
[02:36:46.620 --> 02:36:47.580]  I don't get super high.
[02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:50.420]  I can't get high as fuck off of either of those three strains
[02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:53.300]  but I can catch a really killer smiley buzz.
[02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:55.300]  So something in that orange terp
[02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:57.400]  is really helping you fix your mood.
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:00.780]  The next strain on my list, you guys, is Cindy 99.
[02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:02.900]  Shout out to the Brothers Grim Seed Company.
[02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:06.260]  Cindy 99 has always given me a nice smiley,
[02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:08.100]  cerebral, uplifting buzz.
[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:09.260]  It's just a mood changer.
[02:37:09.300 --> 02:37:10.500]  It gives you a little shift.
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:12.700]  I like it, it's easy to grow.
[02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:14.500]  I think it's available again in seed form
[02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:16.180]  from our friends at Brothers Grim.
[02:37:16.180 --> 02:37:19.660]  You can possibly pick that up at thedankteam.com.
[02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:22.220]  Another one that's always uplifting
[02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:23.160]  and puts me in a good mood
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:25.580]  but is sometimes too much for some people.
[02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:27.420]  This one may give you a little panicky.
[02:37:27.420 --> 02:37:29.860]  If you get a little jittery and too much sativa,
[02:37:29.860 --> 02:37:31.020]  this may be a little too much
[02:37:31.020 --> 02:37:34.700]  but the Jack Herrer has always been a good strain for me.
[02:37:34.700 --> 02:37:37.060]  It changes my mood, it gives me energy,
[02:37:37.060 --> 02:37:39.660]  it keeps me upbeat and it makes me social
[02:37:39.660 --> 02:37:42.020]  but it can drive your head a little crazy.
[02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:43.620]  If you're somebody that gets too talkative
[02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:45.140]  when you smoke too much cannabis,
[02:37:45.140 --> 02:37:47.620]  Jack may not be the cross for you.
[02:37:47.620 --> 02:37:50.540]  If you need to get social, if you're going somewhere
[02:37:50.540 --> 02:37:52.220]  and you're like, I gotta go talk to people,
[02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:54.860]  maybe some Jack will be the one for you.
[02:37:54.860 --> 02:37:56.780]  Another strain that is always uplifting
[02:37:56.780 --> 02:37:57.940]  and puts people in a good mood,
[02:37:57.940 --> 02:37:59.620]  and you guys are gonna be surprised that I say this
[02:37:59.620 --> 02:38:01.140]  because I've made plenty of jokes about it,
[02:38:01.140 --> 02:38:02.340]  but Blue Dream.
[02:38:02.340 --> 02:38:04.100]  Blue Dream is always a good strain
[02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:05.380]  for putting you in a good mood,
[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:06.580]  for changing your vibe.
[02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:09.380]  It's not one of those strains that makes you
[02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:11.340]  wanna curl up into a ball when you get too high
[02:38:11.340 --> 02:38:13.740]  because I've seen people wanna do that.
[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:16.940]  Blue Dream is, you can't get too high from Blue Dream
[02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:18.580]  and it's a nice mellow buzz.
[02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:19.860]  That's why I make fun of Blue Dream,
[02:38:19.860 --> 02:38:21.260]  I call it stripper weed
[02:38:21.260 --> 02:38:23.100]  because that's how high strippers wanna get.
[02:38:23.100 --> 02:38:25.260]  Strippers don't wanna get fucking high as fuck like I do.
[02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:26.500]  Strippers just wanna get a little buzz
[02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:27.620]  and go spend on the pole.
[02:38:27.620 --> 02:38:29.780]  I'm just joking but that's why I call it stripper weed.
[02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:31.860]  So basically any kind of a haze cross, you guys.
[02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:34.460]  Most of what I've mentioned has a haze in it.
[02:38:34.740 --> 02:38:36.260]  Also Jack the Ripper.
[02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:38.020]  Jack Herrer and Jack the Ripper
[02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:39.260]  have a lot of the same parents.
[02:38:39.260 --> 02:38:41.700]  Jack the Ripper is a cross of Jack Herrer.
[02:38:41.700 --> 02:38:43.460]  I strongly recommend some Jack the Ripper,
[02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:45.780]  but like I said about the Herrer,
[02:38:45.780 --> 02:38:47.500]  it could be a bit much for you, you guys.
[02:38:47.500 --> 02:38:49.580]  It could make some people's head spin
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:51.940]  if you're not an experienced smoker.
[02:38:51.940 --> 02:38:54.720]  So if you're trying to beat seasonal effectiveness disorder
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:57.900]  and you are able to take a strong, heavy sativa dose
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:38:59.820]  and you like to get kinda whirlwind high,
[02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:01.500]  grab yourself some Jack the Ripper.
[02:39:01.500 --> 02:39:03.500]  It's available at a lot of dispensaries.
[02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:05.500]  It's a great tasting cannabis.
[02:39:05.500 --> 02:39:07.040]  It has a great high to it.
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:08.540]  And it's usually pretty easy to find
[02:39:08.540 --> 02:39:11.020]  because Subcool is a very popular breeder.
[02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:12.620]  Since we're talking about Subcool,
[02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:14.860]  I'm gonna mention Vortex.
[02:39:14.860 --> 02:39:17.060]  I used to get some Vortex.
[02:39:17.060 --> 02:39:18.580]  It was wax but it was kinda,
[02:39:18.580 --> 02:39:20.140]  it was a different texture of wax
[02:39:20.140 --> 02:39:21.780]  from a dispensary in Denver.
[02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:23.700]  And I loved the high from it.
[02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:26.260]  It made me, it gave me tunnel vision high
[02:39:26.260 --> 02:39:27.900]  to where I couldn't pay attention to anything
[02:39:27.900 --> 02:39:29.820]  except what was right in front of me.
[02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:33.100]  But it also put the stupidest smile on my face.
[02:39:33.740 --> 02:39:35.740]  I really loved the way that Vortex made me feel.
[02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:38.300]  Again, Vortex, if you are not an experienced,
[02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:40.460]  Vortex made my heart race.
[02:39:40.460 --> 02:39:41.860]  It made, you could,
[02:39:41.860 --> 02:39:43.820]  my heart was going, but I love it.
[02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:45.740]  There's something about being too high like that
[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:47.360]  that I really, really enjoy.
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:50.100]  Another strain that is good
[02:39:50.100 --> 02:39:53.500]  for the seasonal effective disorder is the Lemon Jeffrey.
[02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:55.060]  That's a Golden Goat cross two.
[02:39:55.060 --> 02:39:57.180]  It's actually Lemon Skunk cross to Golden Goat.
[02:39:57.180 --> 02:39:58.320]  I bred that one.
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:00.500]  It is one of my favorites to smoke.
[02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:04.100]  It has been tested in the 30% range for THC.
[02:40:04.100 --> 02:40:05.740]  It is definitely a head changer.
[02:40:05.740 --> 02:40:07.940]  Something about the Orange and Lemon Terps,
[02:40:07.940 --> 02:40:10.840]  the Limonene Terps, really create like a good mood,
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:11.980]  a good vibe.
[02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:14.580]  So I think things that smell like oranges,
[02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:16.460]  smell like fruit, smell like lemons
[02:40:16.460 --> 02:40:18.660]  are usually going to be uplifting,
[02:40:18.660 --> 02:40:20.700]  positive vibe kind of strains.
[02:40:20.700 --> 02:40:22.520]  I think most of the Haze crosses
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:24.300]  and the Tangy and Jilly Bean crosses
[02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:28.580]  are usually going to be good to put you into a good mood.
[02:40:28.580 --> 02:40:31.140]  So those are strains that I can recommend for smoking
[02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:32.940]  if they are available where you are.
[02:40:34.580 --> 02:40:36.500]  If smoking isn't something for you,
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:39.580]  and if you're not getting the desired effect from smoking,
[02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:42.140]  edibles may be a better route to go.
[02:40:42.140 --> 02:40:43.660]  Body chemistry is all different.
[02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:45.420]  So if you're trying to fight depression
[02:40:45.420 --> 02:40:47.400]  or seasonal effective depression,
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:49.940]  maybe you need high THC.
[02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:51.700]  Maybe you need CBD.
[02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:54.040]  I would kind of stay away from the Indicas.
[02:40:54.040 --> 02:40:55.420]  What happens to me,
[02:40:56.660 --> 02:40:58.460]  and I have to go in history
[02:40:59.300 --> 02:41:00.980]  because now I smoke so much and my tolerance is so high
[02:41:00.980 --> 02:41:04.580]  and I'm older and I'm more used to being high out of my mind
[02:41:04.580 --> 02:41:06.840]  when I was younger and was new at cannabis,
[02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:08.380]  when I would smoke Sativas,
[02:41:08.380 --> 02:41:10.780]  I would get that real psychedelic high and get talkative,
[02:41:10.780 --> 02:41:11.620]  sort of like I am now.
[02:41:11.620 --> 02:41:13.660]  I'm just fucking rambling and talking about everything.
[02:41:13.660 --> 02:41:15.500]  But then when I would smoke Indicas,
[02:41:15.500 --> 02:41:17.780]  I would go in my head and get quiet.
[02:41:17.780 --> 02:41:18.980]  And that's when you just sit in a chair
[02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:20.200]  and you start thinking too much.
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:21.460]  And I would kind of,
[02:41:21.460 --> 02:41:23.900]  sometimes you could drive yourself crazy thinking too much.
[02:41:23.900 --> 02:41:24.740]  And when you're already
[02:41:24.740 --> 02:41:28.200]  in the seasonal effectiveness disorder kind of head state,
[02:41:28.940 --> 02:41:29.780]  you're just smoking an Indica
[02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:30.720]  that's gonna put you into your own head
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:31.560]  and make you think,
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:33.160]  may fuck you up a little more than you need.
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:34.320]  It may cause more depression.
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:35.800]  It may cause self doubt.
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:37.680]  It may cause confusion.
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:39.160]  It may not be the thing that you need.
[02:41:39.160 --> 02:41:43.560]  So I would go for some Sativa edibles or CBD edibles,
[02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:45.120]  but I would definitely stay away
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:48.360]  from the Indica dominant stuff.
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:50.800]  You guys, I think the most reliable cure
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:52.700]  for seasonal effective disorder
[02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:55.320]  is to smoke a joint and go for a hike.
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:57.140]  Find a nice safe hiking spot,
[02:41:57.180 --> 02:41:59.900]  roll yourself up a nice joint of your favorite strain,
[02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:02.260]  either the Jilly Bean or some Lemon Jeffrey
[02:42:02.260 --> 02:42:04.180]  or whatever you can find that fits in the list
[02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:05.460]  that I talked about.
[02:42:05.460 --> 02:42:08.460]  Get yourself a nice Sativa joint, roll it up,
[02:42:08.460 --> 02:42:10.140]  take one of your best friends with you,
[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:12.820]  take your dog with you, get a bottle of water,
[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:16.380]  go for a walk, smoke a joint and fix your head.
[02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:18.380]  And keep in mind, you guys, it's okay to feel this way.
[02:42:18.380 --> 02:42:20.220]  Everybody's gonna deal with some shit in their life.
[02:42:20.220 --> 02:42:22.300]  It's all right to feel kind of funky once in a while.
[02:42:22.300 --> 02:42:23.580]  Just don't be a dick,
[02:42:23.580 --> 02:42:26.340]  try to deal with it properly and pull yourself through it.
[02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:27.380]  Hopefully when the spring comes,
[02:42:27.380 --> 02:42:28.940]  you'll start cheering up again.
[02:42:28.940 --> 02:42:30.700]  Hopefully by the time 420 rolls around,
[02:42:30.700 --> 02:42:32.580]  you'll be in a good mood and then summer's coming back
[02:42:32.580 --> 02:42:34.460]  and then it's time to get in a good mood again.
[02:42:34.460 --> 02:42:35.500]  Hopefully you can figure it out
[02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:37.380]  and not go through it again next year.
[02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:38.780]  All right, you guys, that was my quick talk
[02:42:38.780 --> 02:42:41.660]  on seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[02:42:41.660 --> 02:42:42.780]  I hope I was helpful.
[02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:44.060]  I hope I could guide you in the right way
[02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:46.180]  to select cannabis to keep you in a good mood.
[02:42:46.180 --> 02:42:47.400]  Hey, even if you're not suffering
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:48.900]  through some seasonal depression,
[02:42:48.900 --> 02:42:51.040]  all of these strains will probably put a smile on your face,
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:52.420]  keep you social.
[02:42:52.420 --> 02:42:53.620]  If you have to go to lunch with somebody
[02:42:53.620 --> 02:42:54.980]  you don't really care to go to lunch with,
[02:42:54.980 --> 02:42:55.900]  if you've got to do a chore
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:57.420]  you don't really give a shit to do,
[02:42:57.420 --> 02:42:58.660]  try smoking one of these strains.
[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:01.140]  It just might put you in a better mood for doing it.
[02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:02.260]  All right, you guys, I want to thank everybody
[02:43:02.260 --> 02:43:03.780]  for listening to a short podcast.
[02:43:03.780 --> 02:43:05.220]  This was right at 20 minutes.
[02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:06.460]  I appreciate you for joining me
[02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:08.100]  for a Thursday bonus episode.
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:10.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have any topics
[02:43:10.420 --> 02:43:11.900]  you'd like me to talk about on the show,
[02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:14.140]  send me an email, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:43:14.140 --> 02:43:15.300]  I would love to hear from you.
[02:43:15.300 --> 02:43:17.620]  I would also appreciate it if you follow me on Twitter,
[02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:19.980]  it's at GFYHpodcast.
[02:43:19.980 --> 02:43:22.580]  I want to send a huge shout out to my friend, Bo Nellis.
[02:43:22.580 --> 02:43:24.940]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[02:43:25.780 --> 02:43:26.780]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:48:36.050 --> 02:48:37.850]  All right, podcast world, I want to thank you guys again
[02:48:37.850 --> 02:48:40.170]  for listening to a long block of old episodes.
