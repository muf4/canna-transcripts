[00:03.390 --> 00:10.640]  All right, here we go.
[00:10.640 --> 00:12.280]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:12.280 --> 00:13.280]  I'm your host.
[00:13.280 --> 00:20.500]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 687 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:20.500 --> 00:25.160]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about germinating seeds, but before we get to that part of the
[00:25.160 --> 00:29.720]  show, let's do a few shout-outs to a few of those great folks who continue to support

[01:24.700 --> 01:27.200]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:27.200 --> 01:31.280]  And you know I do include a link in the show notes and the video description to make it
[01:31.280 --> 01:33.960]  nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:33.960 --> 01:38.400]  All right I don't want to waste too much time I don't want to make this a super long episode.
[01:38.400 --> 01:42.880]  Let's jump right into the germinating seeds portion of this podcast.
[01:42.880 --> 01:46.560]  A lot of people are buying seeds, a lot of people are trying to get them started as a
[01:46.560 --> 01:48.080]  seed maker, a seed seller.
[01:48.080 --> 01:52.360]  I feel like it could be partly my responsibility to make sure you have good luck with these
[01:52.360 --> 01:56.240]  seeds so let's do a quick seed germinating episode.
[01:56.240 --> 01:58.800]  I'm getting all the supplies I need gathered here in front of me.
[01:58.840 --> 02:02.080]  We're going to start with a big jar of blue raspberry truffle seeds.
[02:02.080 --> 02:04.840]  These were grown this summer in a greenhouse.
[02:04.840 --> 02:08.040]  These will be a great example to get us going here on the show.
[02:08.040 --> 02:11.880]  Let's talk about the things we need for a successful germination.
[02:11.880 --> 02:15.880]  Number one ingredient for a successful seed germination is quality seeds.
[02:15.880 --> 02:18.680]  We want big, fat, healthy seeds.
[02:18.680 --> 02:21.640]  Any seed that comes from my brand, let me show you something I do.
[02:21.640 --> 02:22.640]  I've never done this on a show.
[02:22.640 --> 02:24.240]  I've never showed anybody this.
[02:24.240 --> 02:27.360]  These are the actual seeds that you will get if you purchase Iri seeds.
[02:27.400 --> 02:29.280]  I'm just going to dump a couple into the lid.
[02:29.280 --> 02:31.360]  This is how I would package your seeds.
[02:31.360 --> 02:35.600]  As I'm packaging, each one would get set on the table and pressed under my finger.
[02:35.600 --> 02:36.600]  You can see I'm pressing.
[02:36.600 --> 02:37.600]  It is not breaking.
[02:37.600 --> 02:39.000]  I'm putting a lot of pressure on it.
[02:39.000 --> 02:40.240]  It's not squishing or popping.
[02:40.240 --> 02:41.840]  This is a high quality seed.
[02:41.840 --> 02:43.920]  I pressed so hard it has stuck to my finger.
[02:43.920 --> 02:46.520]  I pressed so hard I've got a nice indention in my finger.
[02:46.520 --> 02:47.600]  This finger is calloused.
[02:47.600 --> 02:50.160]  This is a soldier finger for testing seeds.
[02:50.160 --> 02:52.120]  These are high quality seeds in my opinion.
[02:52.120 --> 02:53.200]  These will germinate.
[02:53.200 --> 02:54.960]  These are very viable seeds.
[02:54.960 --> 02:56.720]  So what I'm going to do, I'm going to take a few of these seeds.
[02:56.760 --> 02:58.440]  I just dropped them right here into the lid.
[02:58.440 --> 02:59.440]  I'm going to make sure they're clean.
[02:59.440 --> 03:01.600]  I don't need any seed holes or any of that stuff in here.
[03:01.600 --> 03:03.560]  We don't need that to contaminate our mess.
[03:03.560 --> 03:04.600]  You won't get that part.
[03:04.600 --> 03:06.200]  You won't have seed holes and extra junk.
[03:06.200 --> 03:11.400]  This is just a jar of uncleaned seeds, kind of unrefined, unsorted seeds.
[03:11.400 --> 03:12.240]  So these are just seeds.
[03:12.240 --> 03:14.240]  I'm pouring them out, making a few selections.
[03:14.240 --> 03:14.880]  We've got enough.
[03:14.880 --> 03:16.920]  Going to put these away.
[03:16.920 --> 03:18.080]  Try to keep myself on track here.
[03:18.080 --> 03:19.400]  But we've got some seeds.
[03:19.400 --> 03:22.160]  That's the main ingredient here for successful germination.
[03:22.160 --> 03:25.600]  This is honestly how I germinate seeds that I'm going to run in my garden.
[03:25.600 --> 03:26.920]  This is how I do test seeds.
[03:26.920 --> 03:29.160]  This is how I do dispensary grow seeds.
[03:29.160 --> 03:31.280]  Any seeds I'm going to grow, this is how I do it.
[03:31.280 --> 03:33.880]  I get this really technical piece of equipment here.
[03:33.880 --> 03:35.560]  This is a paper towel.
[03:35.560 --> 03:37.160]  This is from the dollar store.
[03:37.160 --> 03:38.000]  Super affordable.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.280]  Everybody should have this.
[03:39.280 --> 03:41.080]  Maybe you should have a rag instead of paper towels.
[03:41.080 --> 03:43.360]  But today we're going to use a paper towel.
[03:43.360 --> 03:45.160]  A lot of times I won't even use the whole sheet.
[03:45.160 --> 03:47.160]  Luckily, we've got the brand that gives you half sheets.
[03:47.160 --> 03:49.360]  We're going to take a half sheet, be more economical here.
[03:49.360 --> 03:50.640]  I'm going to fold it in half.
[03:50.640 --> 03:52.280]  This is really critical.
[03:52.280 --> 03:54.280]  Fold it in half, and then half again.
[03:54.280 --> 03:54.800]  I'm just kidding.
[03:54.800 --> 03:56.360]  This is not very critical at all.
[03:56.360 --> 03:57.160]  I was being a smart ass.
[03:57.160 --> 03:58.360]  I hope you caught on to that.
[03:58.360 --> 04:00.600]  I'm going to fold it to this size.
[04:00.600 --> 04:02.200]  Then I'm going to move these seeds out of the way
[04:02.200 --> 04:03.880]  because I don't need them wet just yet.
[04:03.880 --> 04:05.240]  Dump those on the table.
[04:05.240 --> 04:07.920]  I'm going to fold it to this size.
[04:07.920 --> 04:12.480]  Then I'm going to get this really expensive, fancy technical substance
[04:12.480 --> 04:14.000]  here called bottled water.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.160]  So far, everybody should be able to follow along.
[04:16.160 --> 04:18.400]  We should all have these products readily available.
[04:18.400 --> 04:21.000]  Then I'm just going to soak this paper towel.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.440]  I'm just pouring bottled water over the paper towel until it is saturated.
[04:24.440 --> 04:25.360]  It is soaked.
[04:25.360 --> 04:26.520]  It's not going to take much more water.
[04:26.520 --> 04:28.120]  I'm going to let it sit right there.
[04:28.120 --> 04:29.880]  Then I've got a little bowl over here.
[04:29.880 --> 04:32.720]  Nothing fancy, just a cereal bowl, maybe a small cereal bowl.
[04:32.720 --> 04:36.000]  I'm going to pour this excess water into the bowl.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.880]  Now I've got a saturated paper towel sitting on a plate.
[04:38.880 --> 04:40.440]  So far, we haven't gotten really technical.
[04:40.440 --> 04:41.880]  We haven't gotten really crazy.
[04:41.880 --> 04:43.320]  I hope everybody can follow along.
[04:43.320 --> 04:45.120]  Then here's the fun part.
[04:45.120 --> 04:48.400]  Better close up this water with all this electronic shit around here.
[04:48.400 --> 04:49.160]  Put the stuff away.
[04:49.160 --> 04:50.200]  Here comes the fun part.
[04:50.200 --> 04:54.880]  So the seeds, put them on one side of your paper towel that is wet.
[04:54.880 --> 04:56.840]  Pick one side, put them on there.
[04:56.840 --> 04:59.480]  Just drop them right in there.
[04:59.480 --> 05:04.200]  And then really easily, real gently, I'm going to take the other side.
[05:04.200 --> 05:05.760]  I'm just going to fold it up.
[05:05.760 --> 05:08.680]  So now I've just got a paper towel folded like this.
[05:08.680 --> 05:09.400]  It's really wet.
[05:09.400 --> 05:10.280]  You can see some water coming out.
[05:10.280 --> 05:11.000]  That's too much water.
[05:11.000 --> 05:12.960]  I'm going to let that water drip out.
[05:12.960 --> 05:16.440]  But when it quits dripping right about there, we're basically done.
[05:16.440 --> 05:21.480]  I'm going to take this and I'm going to stick this inside of a baggie.
[05:21.480 --> 05:24.600]  The reason I'm putting it in the baggie is I want to retain this moisture.
[05:24.600 --> 05:26.800]  I'm going to go, I've got places to go today.
[05:26.800 --> 05:27.840]  I can't get this baggie open.
[05:27.840 --> 05:28.400]  There we go.
[05:28.400 --> 05:29.440]  I've got places to go today.
[05:29.440 --> 05:30.560]  I've got things to do.
[05:30.560 --> 05:33.320]  I know that by placing this inside of this baggie, I have now trapped this
[05:33.320 --> 05:34.440]  moisture in here.
[05:34.440 --> 05:36.680]  We've just created a little humidity zone.
[05:36.680 --> 05:38.520]  The seeds are in there getting really wet.
[05:38.520 --> 05:39.720]  There's humidity trapped in there.
[05:39.720 --> 05:42.840]  I'm going to set this in a warm place.
[05:42.840 --> 05:44.400]  I've got a grow light that is on.
[05:44.400 --> 05:47.680]  I've got a T5 light right on top of that grow light will be perfect.
[05:47.680 --> 05:48.480]  It's warm.
[05:48.480 --> 05:51.600]  It'll get this seed going and it will start germinating.
[05:51.600 --> 05:53.040]  That wasn't super technical.
[05:53.040 --> 05:55.440]  Honestly, that is how I germinate all of my seeds.
[05:55.440 --> 05:56.960]  Then we'll take this plate here.
[05:56.960 --> 06:00.880]  We're just going to pour this excess water right into this bowl that we've got.
[06:00.880 --> 06:05.360]  And then what I will do, usually this would go sit on the grow light.
[06:05.360 --> 06:08.040]  But right now, we're just going to leave it right here on the table.
[06:08.040 --> 06:09.880]  So now while I'm recording, this will just chill right here.
[06:09.880 --> 06:11.000]  It is totally fine.
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.280]  That is going to germinate.
[06:12.280 --> 06:18.640]  It will take probably somewhere around 24 to 48 hours before you start seeing little tails.
[06:18.640 --> 06:19.400]  That is our goal here.
[06:19.400 --> 06:20.840]  We want these seeds to pop open.
[06:20.840 --> 06:24.720]  I won't touch this or open this for probably 24 to 48 hours.
[06:24.720 --> 06:25.920]  This will go somewhere.
[06:25.920 --> 06:28.800]  Like I said, I'm going to put it on top of a T5 grow light.
[06:28.800 --> 06:29.880]  I don't want to roast these.
[06:29.880 --> 06:30.720]  I don't want to cook them.
[06:30.720 --> 06:32.160]  I don't want to barbecue them.
[06:32.160 --> 06:34.080]  I don't want to ruin them with too much heat.
[06:34.080 --> 06:34.600]  It is cold.
[06:34.600 --> 06:35.360]  It's cold here today.
[06:35.360 --> 06:36.720]  You notice I got a long-sleeved shirt on.
[06:36.720 --> 06:38.640]  It's been pretty cold in Colorado.
[06:38.640 --> 06:41.640]  They would be okay here in this ambient environment.
[06:41.680 --> 06:48.360]  They're okay in the environment in which you are in, but I think in my veg area, right on top of that T5 light,
[06:48.360 --> 06:49.720]  they'll just be a little bit cozier.
[06:49.720 --> 06:51.400]  It's just a little bit warmer.
[06:51.400 --> 06:54.000]  I don't generally put them on a heating mat.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.640]  I'm only doing that because it is winter time.
[06:56.640 --> 07:00.920]  We are shifting from the warm to the cold season, and I don't want to risk these seeds.
[07:00.920 --> 07:02.600]  I don't want you to risk your seeds.
[07:02.600 --> 07:05.640]  So this is the type of climate when I would use some heating.
[07:05.640 --> 07:08.800]  Just that grow light is all I'm going to use, and that will be enough.
[07:08.800 --> 07:11.040]  I've got some notes I want to make sure I got.
[07:11.080 --> 07:16.560]  We are going to fold the paper towel, wet the paper towel, put the seeds in there, fold it up, put it in the baggie,
[07:16.560 --> 07:19.240]  and we're going to let it sit for 24 to 48 hours.
[07:19.240 --> 07:20.680]  Then we're going to check on it.
[07:20.680 --> 07:23.040]  Through the magic of technology, I planned ahead.
[07:23.040 --> 07:24.920]  I germinated some seeds yesterday.
[07:24.920 --> 07:26.080]  I haven't opened this.
[07:26.080 --> 07:27.880]  This has been sealed up for 24 hours.
[07:27.880 --> 07:31.480]  We're going to pop it open now together, and we're going to see what happened.
[07:31.480 --> 07:35.080]  These have been sitting on top of a T5 light just chilling.
[07:35.080 --> 07:38.240]  We're going to pop them open together, and we will see what we're expecting.
[07:38.760 --> 07:43.240]  I will take a picture with my phone and insert this into the video just so you can get a better glimpse.
[07:43.240 --> 07:44.200]  Oh, I am impressed.
[07:44.200 --> 07:48.040]  I don't know if this is coming up on camera, but we have got some sprouts here.
[07:48.040 --> 07:50.360]  I would be very gentle if I were you.
[07:50.360 --> 07:54.720]  This is a germination test on a new line for me, so these aren't hypercritical for me.
[07:54.720 --> 07:59.080]  They don't have to go anywhere, but this is what you will see in 24 to 48 hours.
[07:59.080 --> 08:00.880]  I got little ... They look like spermies.
[08:00.880 --> 08:02.600]  It's a seed with a tail on it.
[08:02.600 --> 08:03.480]  I'm trying to put it somewhere.
[08:03.480 --> 08:05.000]  I can't see what shows up on the camera.
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.120]  It's kind of far away.
[08:06.120 --> 08:07.080]  Put it right here in front of the mic.
[08:07.200 --> 08:11.200]  Maybe you can see the little tail that's popping up, but it's got little tails coming out of it.
[08:11.200 --> 08:17.640]  At this point, these seeds are ready to go into cocoa, dirt, hydroponics, however you're going to grow them.
[08:17.640 --> 08:18.640]  Now is the time.
[08:18.640 --> 08:21.680]  At this point, I'm going to snap a quick photo and try to keep talking.
[08:21.680 --> 08:24.880]  At this point, I would get my container, whatever I'm going to put them in.
[08:24.880 --> 08:33.440]  In my experience, in my situation, I would take a beer cup, a red Solo cup filled with a fluffy soil.
[08:33.480 --> 08:40.120]  I'm not going to say any brand names or anything like that, but a soilless mix or cocoa with a lot of perlite in it so it's nice and fluffy.
[08:40.120 --> 08:41.640]  I would fill my container.
[08:41.640 --> 08:44.520]  I would pack it not tight, but semi-tight.
[08:44.520 --> 08:47.760]  I'd press it down so that it's in there so that the seed has something to dig through.
[08:47.760 --> 08:50.560]  I want the seed to dig a little bit, but also don't want it to struggle.
[08:50.560 --> 08:52.160]  I've got it semi-packed.
[08:52.160 --> 08:54.720]  I would water my medium at this point.
[08:54.720 --> 08:57.400]  Before I put the seed in there, I would water that container.
[08:57.400 --> 08:59.640]  I've got my soilless mix in my cup.
[08:59.640 --> 09:01.800]  Make sure your container has drainage holes.
[09:01.800 --> 09:04.120]  If you're using cups, you have to put your own holes in it.
[09:04.120 --> 09:07.960]  You don't want to fill the cup up with water and create a mud situation in there.
[09:07.960 --> 09:09.600]  Poke some holes in a cup.
[09:09.600 --> 09:11.800]  Fill it with your medium of choice.
[09:11.800 --> 09:13.440]  Then water it at this point.
[09:13.440 --> 09:17.000]  pH adjust the water to somewhere between 5.8 and 6.4.
[09:17.000 --> 09:18.640]  You will be just fine.
[09:18.640 --> 09:19.640]  Water it.
[09:19.640 --> 09:20.640]  I don't add any nutrients.
[09:20.640 --> 09:22.720]  I may add some microbes at this time.
[09:22.720 --> 09:24.680]  Usually don't add any nutrients.
[09:24.680 --> 09:28.520]  Most of the soil that I buy has already got microbes in it, so I don't need to add a lot.
[09:28.520 --> 09:30.880]  I've got my container with holes in it.
[09:30.960 --> 09:34.320]  It's got soil or soilless mix or cocoa with perlite in there.
[09:34.320 --> 09:35.320]  Now I've watered it.
[09:35.320 --> 09:40.240]  At this point, I would put my finger into that mix about to the first knuckle.
[09:40.240 --> 09:42.620]  One knuckle deep is as deep as I would go.
[09:42.620 --> 09:44.960]  Right in the center, just make a knuckle deep indention.
[09:44.960 --> 09:46.360]  Then I would put a seed right in there.
[09:46.360 --> 09:48.880]  Let me snap a picture of these seeds, and then I will show you how I would put them
[09:48.880 --> 09:49.960]  in there.
[09:49.960 --> 09:52.320]  You'll see this picture right here will end up in the video.
[09:52.320 --> 09:53.320]  Boom.
[09:53.320 --> 09:55.240]  Those are the little tails we got.
[09:55.240 --> 10:00.320]  At this point, I would take a seed, and I would gently set it right into ... They're
[10:00.320 --> 10:01.400]  kind of stuck to the paper towel.
[10:01.400 --> 10:03.600]  Be careful pulling them off the paper towel.
[10:03.600 --> 10:04.600]  Don't break them.
[10:04.600 --> 10:05.680]  There we go.
[10:05.680 --> 10:07.160]  This one's got a really long tail.
[10:07.160 --> 10:09.520]  I hope you can see how long the tail is on this seed.
[10:09.520 --> 10:11.280]  I'm getting it in front of the black microphone.
[10:11.280 --> 10:12.280]  Hopefully that helps you.
[10:12.280 --> 10:14.600]  It's got a really long tail on it.
[10:14.600 --> 10:17.840]  This is the direction in which it wants to be planted.
[10:17.840 --> 10:19.360]  The tail goes down.
[10:19.360 --> 10:20.680]  The seed goes up.
[10:20.680 --> 10:22.920]  You want your roots to grow down into the dirt.
[10:22.920 --> 10:25.480]  You want your seed to grow up and pop out of the dirt.
[10:25.480 --> 10:28.000]  This is a beautiful ... This is impressive.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.720]  This is a very beautiful specimen of a seed.
[10:30.120 --> 10:32.200]  I'm really glad that we decided to germinate these.
[10:32.200 --> 10:35.680]  I'm trying to zoom in for you and do some camera cuts, and I'm thinking ahead.
[10:35.680 --> 10:37.240]  Look at the health and beauty of this seed.
[10:37.240 --> 10:38.360]  This is a very beautiful seed.
[10:38.360 --> 10:40.120]  I'm very lucky that we germinated these.
[10:40.120 --> 10:41.920]  I'm very glad that I got to show you these.
[10:41.920 --> 10:43.200]  These are vigorous seeds.
[10:43.200 --> 10:44.920]  Normally, it wouldn't stand up like that.
[10:44.920 --> 10:48.000]  The root shouldn't hold it up, but this root is acting like a stem already.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.040]  It's so strong and super vigorous.
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.240]  You'd want to plant it with the root going down and the seed pointing up.
[10:54.240 --> 10:57.040]  Don't plant it so deep that it has to struggle.
[10:57.040 --> 10:58.360]  Like I said, knuckle deep.
[10:58.360 --> 10:59.400]  My fingers are kind of big.
[10:59.400 --> 11:01.560]  I'm still going knuckle deep.
[11:01.560 --> 11:04.240]  Maybe a short finger, maybe only halfway to a knuckle.
[11:04.240 --> 11:05.560]  Just go knuckle deep.
[11:05.560 --> 11:08.840]  Set that seed right in there to where it's pointing up, and then just scoop the dirt
[11:08.840 --> 11:09.960]  right back over it.
[11:09.960 --> 11:10.960]  Don't bury it.
[11:10.960 --> 11:12.520]  Just lightly backfill it.
[11:12.520 --> 11:14.720]  Then that seed, the taproot, will dig down.
[11:14.720 --> 11:16.200]  The top will start popping up.
[11:16.200 --> 11:20.800]  Now you have successfully germinated and planted your seeds.
[11:20.800 --> 11:23.920]  Let me make sure there are more notes that I want to keep up on.
[11:23.920 --> 11:27.800]  Now you need to keep your seedlings in a good environment.
[11:27.800 --> 11:31.480]  The T5 light that these have been sitting on top of, now they're going to go right underneath
[11:31.480 --> 11:32.480]  there.
[11:32.480 --> 11:35.400]  Once they get a little bit bigger, I will move them to the LED lights.
[11:35.400 --> 11:37.560]  My small veg space is a T5 right now.
[11:37.560 --> 11:39.400]  That's just the way that things are going.
[11:39.400 --> 11:41.080]  They would go under a T5 light.
[11:41.080 --> 11:46.840]  I would keep them on a minimum of 18 hours of daylight, of lights on schedule, maybe
[11:46.840 --> 11:50.320]  more, maybe 20, maybe 24 for a few days.
[11:50.320 --> 11:54.640]  At this point, I would just keep them under a strong vegetative light cycle.
[11:54.640 --> 11:56.640]  They don't need a lot of light right now.
[11:56.640 --> 11:59.480]  If you see them stretching, they're not getting enough light.
[11:59.480 --> 12:01.760]  If you're giving them proper light, they'll stay short and squatty.
[12:01.760 --> 12:03.000]  They don't need intense light.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  They just need the right light.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.520]  A T5 or an LED will be perfect.
[12:06.520 --> 12:11.900]  I put them under a light with somewhere more than 18 hours of light.
[12:11.900 --> 12:15.800]  Sometimes my veg spaces get 20 hours of light and four hours of darkness.
[12:15.800 --> 12:18.760]  Sometimes I do 19.5, sometimes 18.6.
[12:18.760 --> 12:20.860]  Somewhere in that area will be good for your plants.
[12:20.860 --> 12:21.860]  Keep them in veg.
[12:21.860 --> 12:24.240]  They won't flower until you put them on 12.12.
[12:24.240 --> 12:27.680]  Just get them under a solid vegetative schedule.
[12:27.680 --> 12:29.620]  If they're stretching, they want more light.
[12:29.620 --> 12:31.440]  If they're staying short, they're getting enough light.
[12:31.440 --> 12:34.600]  If they look like they're kind of roasting on you, they're getting too much light.
[12:34.600 --> 12:36.680]  That's something you'll have to learn to adjust.
[12:36.680 --> 12:39.880]  It's going to be plant specific, light specific, environment specific.
[12:39.880 --> 12:41.320]  That'll be a trick to learn.
[12:41.320 --> 12:44.040]  That's one of the details you'll have to learn in your grow.
[12:44.040 --> 12:45.040]  Environment.
[12:45.040 --> 12:48.820]  I would keep them around 75 to 85 degrees.
[12:48.820 --> 12:50.280]  That is optimal for the seedlings.
[12:50.280 --> 12:52.320]  Maybe a little bit higher may be better.
[12:52.320 --> 12:53.960]  The colder will slow them down.
[12:53.960 --> 12:56.280]  Here we'll get them growing a little more quickly.
[12:56.280 --> 12:57.760]  Higher humidity is better.
[12:57.760 --> 13:01.360]  I understand that sometimes it's hard to get high humidity, especially right now.
[13:01.360 --> 13:03.400]  We're in winter in Colorado.
[13:03.400 --> 13:04.400]  It's dry here.
[13:04.400 --> 13:06.280]  So the higher humidity, the better.
[13:06.280 --> 13:09.280]  75, 85 degrees temperature is good.
[13:09.280 --> 13:12.640]  I do not use domes for my seedlings.
[13:12.640 --> 13:16.680]  I see a lot of people put their seedlings in a dome or put some sort of cover on it.
[13:16.680 --> 13:18.700]  I do not do that.
[13:18.700 --> 13:21.560]  In my opinion, that makes for weak seedlings.
[13:21.560 --> 13:24.400]  I want these seedlings to come out and be ready.
[13:24.400 --> 13:25.560]  Domes are for clones.
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.460]  When you cut a clone, the clone doesn't have a root source, a root zone, a life source
[13:29.460 --> 13:30.600]  to keep it going.
[13:30.600 --> 13:33.240]  The clones have to survive from the humidity in the environment.
[13:33.240 --> 13:36.740]  If there's no moisture in the air, they don't have any way to sustain themselves.
[13:36.740 --> 13:38.200]  They don't have roots to drink.
[13:38.200 --> 13:39.200]  So they need a dome.
[13:39.200 --> 13:41.260]  We have to control that humidity in the clones.
[13:41.260 --> 13:43.360]  The seedlings don't need that dome.
[13:43.360 --> 13:46.800]  I think they want exposure to the environment, exposure to the wind.
[13:46.800 --> 13:47.800]  That makes them tougher.
[13:47.800 --> 13:50.160]  Then we don't have to harden them off like we do clones.
[13:50.160 --> 13:53.960]  I think that the dome kind of turns your seedlings into, it makes them weak, makes
[13:53.960 --> 13:57.680]  them little bitches, doesn't give them the vigor that they need from the very beginning.
[13:57.680 --> 14:00.920]  I want these seeds going strong from day one.
[14:00.920 --> 14:03.920]  So I do not use a dome for my seedlings.
[14:03.920 --> 14:05.760]  Most of the time I do not use a heating mat.
[14:05.760 --> 14:08.920]  I do keep saying I'm going to put these seedlings on top of the T5.
[14:08.920 --> 14:11.640]  It is really cold at this time of year in Colorado.
[14:11.640 --> 14:15.320]  I may use that T5 light just to get them germinated.
[14:15.320 --> 14:18.640]  Past that there's not going to be any heat mat, nothing underneath them.
[14:18.640 --> 14:20.400]  I've seen more people cook and roast seeds.
[14:20.400 --> 14:25.240]  I've honestly roasted and boiled more seeds than I've germinated when using a heat mat.
[14:25.240 --> 14:28.800]  I keep checking my notes to make sure I'm getting it going.
[14:28.800 --> 14:32.120]  Sometimes the seed shell will get stuck to your seed.
[14:32.120 --> 14:33.780]  Let me show you a good example.
[14:33.780 --> 14:35.280]  This seedling will start to grow.
[14:35.280 --> 14:38.600]  It'll pop up out of the dirt and then it'll go up toward the light.
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.760]  This little shell on here sometimes gets stuck to the seed and people really panic.
[14:43.760 --> 14:45.000]  Your seed may open up.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.820]  You may have a little plant forming and the little helmet just might be stuck on there
[14:48.820 --> 14:51.000]  or it might not even have opened.
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.200]  This is not a big deal.
[14:52.200 --> 14:53.680]  This is not cause for concern.
[14:53.680 --> 14:55.320]  This is no reason to panic.
[14:55.320 --> 15:00.520]  It is very easy to fix if you are careful and delicate and pay attention.
[15:00.520 --> 15:03.560]  The easiest way in my experience, I call it taking off the helmet.
[15:03.560 --> 15:04.560]  The helmet got stuck.
[15:04.560 --> 15:05.560]  That's all.
[15:05.560 --> 15:09.000]  You just got to get the helmet off and get that soldier back into battle.
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  The helmet will get stuck.
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.260]  The easiest way in my opinion, I get a spray bottle that you could spray like just a little
[15:14.260 --> 15:15.260]  squeeze sprayer.
[15:15.260 --> 15:16.260]  You know what I mean?
[15:16.260 --> 15:17.260]  Like you use it to clean the windows.
[15:17.260 --> 15:19.580]  Get a spray bottle and just mist it with water.
[15:19.580 --> 15:20.580]  Just put some water.
[15:20.580 --> 15:21.580]  You don't have to pH it.
[15:21.580 --> 15:22.580]  You can if you want.
[15:22.580 --> 15:27.300]  I just get some water, throw it in a spray bottle, spray the seedling, spray the helmet
[15:27.300 --> 15:28.740]  and you'll notice it softens it up.
[15:28.740 --> 15:32.540]  I don't know if I want to risk doing it to this seed but once you soften it up, you can
[15:32.540 --> 15:35.220]  just grab it and you can just probably pull it right off.
[15:35.220 --> 15:38.940]  This one doesn't want to come off yet but if it were opened up more, it would slide
[15:38.940 --> 15:40.220]  right off.
[15:40.220 --> 15:43.740]  If you've got big clumsy gorilla fingers like me, I'm a big dude.
[15:43.740 --> 15:45.540]  I got big fucking sausage fingers.
[15:45.540 --> 15:46.820]  You may want to use some tweezers.
[15:46.820 --> 15:50.300]  Get in there gently with tweezers and just pull the helmet right off.
[15:50.300 --> 15:52.960]  Spray it with some water and just let it come right off.
[15:52.960 --> 15:56.380]  If you're pulling and struggling, let it wait a couple days.
[15:56.380 --> 15:58.180]  Nature pushes that shell off.
[15:58.180 --> 15:59.660]  It wants to come off.
[15:59.660 --> 16:04.140]  So in time with water, with a little help and a little encouragement, you will be able
[16:04.140 --> 16:06.580]  to get that off without causing problems.
[16:06.580 --> 16:07.960]  Don't panic and don't freak out.
[16:07.960 --> 16:09.260]  Don't pull too hard.
[16:09.260 --> 16:10.260]  Spray it with water.
[16:10.260 --> 16:11.820]  The water will act like a lubricant.
[16:11.820 --> 16:13.740]  It'll make everything separate.
[16:13.740 --> 16:15.660]  It'll make it super easy for you.
[16:15.660 --> 16:18.300]  So if that seed shell gets stuck, just moisten it up.
[16:18.300 --> 16:19.300]  Use some tweezers.
[16:19.300 --> 16:20.300]  Pull it right off.
[16:20.300 --> 16:23.020]  If you don't have tweezers, if you have confidence, if you've got a steady hand, get in there
[16:23.020 --> 16:24.740]  and just pull it right off with your fingers.
[16:24.740 --> 16:27.700]  Fortunately, I've got a lot of seeds so I can play with them and learn that sort of
[16:27.700 --> 16:30.820]  stuff and figure out those kind of experiments for you.
[16:30.820 --> 16:33.300]  You do have to be delicate with these because they are seedlings.
[16:33.300 --> 16:37.680]  They're small, little delicate baby life forms but they're not precious.
[16:37.680 --> 16:38.860]  You're not going to destroy them.
[16:38.860 --> 16:39.860]  You can handle them.
[16:39.860 --> 16:40.860]  You can see I'm picking them up.
[16:40.900 --> 16:41.900]  I'm playing with them.
[16:41.900 --> 16:42.900]  This will still grow.
[16:42.900 --> 16:43.900]  This is going to be a very viable seed.
[16:43.900 --> 16:44.900]  I'm throwing it around.
[16:44.900 --> 16:45.900]  I'm playing with it.
[16:45.900 --> 16:48.940]  The acids on my fingers are probably not good for this.
[16:48.940 --> 16:53.020]  I should probably be wearing gloves but this is nature.
[16:53.020 --> 16:54.260]  It's going to go into the dirt.
[16:54.260 --> 16:56.020]  There's going to be microbes in the dirt.
[16:56.020 --> 16:57.180]  There's going to be roly polies.
[16:57.180 --> 16:58.180]  There's going to be spiders.
[16:58.180 --> 16:59.780]  There's going to be worms.
[16:59.780 --> 17:03.340]  As this plant grows, if it were to grow in nature, a goat would piss on it.
[17:03.340 --> 17:04.840]  The wind would knock it over.
[17:04.840 --> 17:06.240]  These are resilient plants.
[17:06.240 --> 17:10.220]  Nature made this plant very resilient and then the breeders have definitely found the
[17:10.260 --> 17:14.180]  keepers out of those resilient plants and we've made it even better.
[17:14.180 --> 17:15.820]  Don't be too afraid to handle your plants.
[17:15.820 --> 17:17.820]  Don't be too afraid to handle your seeds.
[17:17.820 --> 17:18.820]  Get in there.
[17:18.820 --> 17:19.820]  Learn your plants.
[17:19.820 --> 17:20.820]  Learn your seeds.
[17:20.820 --> 17:21.820]  Touch them.
[17:21.820 --> 17:22.820]  Look at them.
[17:22.820 --> 17:23.820]  Have you ever just examined a seedling like this?
[17:23.820 --> 17:24.820]  It's pretty interesting.
[17:24.820 --> 17:25.820]  It started off as a seed.

[17:28.660 --> 17:31.500]  In 12 or 13 weeks, we're going to be smoking this.
[17:31.500 --> 17:32.500]  Isn't that crazy?
