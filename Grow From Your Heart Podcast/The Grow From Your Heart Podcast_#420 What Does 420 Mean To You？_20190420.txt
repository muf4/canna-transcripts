[00:00.830 --> 00:18.830]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:18.830 --> 00:22.830]  It is time for episode 420 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:22.830 --> 00:27.390]  Happy 420, everybody, and thank you for joining me for this 420 episode.
[00:27.390 --> 00:30.670]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:30.670 --> 00:35.410]  On 420, Oregon Elite Seeds will be dropping the first batch of Blue Raspberry Truffle,
[00:35.410 --> 00:41.750]  so make sure you check them out at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:41.750 --> 00:46.030]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I am smoking.
[00:46.030 --> 00:50.550]  It is the day before 420, so I have been smoking a little bit of everything.
[00:50.550 --> 00:55.150]  I just smoked a big fat joint of strawberry starburst flowers grown by my friend Kelvin
[00:55.150 --> 00:56.150]  Medina.
[00:56.150 --> 00:57.150]  Big shout out to Kelvin.
[00:57.150 --> 01:01.470]  I also just took a big fat dab of grape cola batter from Apothecary Farms, and I followed
[01:01.470 --> 01:05.390]  that up with a dab of Fortissimo from Green Dot Labs.
[01:05.390 --> 01:11.470]  I am heavily medicated, but what else would you expect from a podcast recorded on 419?
[01:11.470 --> 01:12.750]  Happy 420 again, everybody.
[01:12.750 --> 01:14.750]  I am in the mood for podcasting.
[01:14.750 --> 01:16.730]  I am in the mood to smoke some dabs.
[01:16.730 --> 01:21.830]  I am in the mood to talk about cannabis, and I'm definitely excited to talk about 420.
[01:21.830 --> 01:25.670]  In the past few episodes and on my social media, I've been asking my audience to tell
[01:25.670 --> 01:27.750]  me what 420 means to them.
[01:27.750 --> 01:31.750]  In this episode, we're going to talk about 420 and what it means to you, and we will
[01:31.750 --> 01:35.710]  wrap it up by talking about what 420 means to me.
[01:35.710 --> 01:39.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, smokers and growers, roll up a fat joint, put some fresh water
[01:39.510 --> 01:44.110]  in the bong, or get yourself a dab ready, and let's talk about what 420 means to you
[01:44.110 --> 01:45.910]  and to me.
[01:45.910 --> 01:47.830]  I've got a bunch of messages saved here in my phone.
[01:47.830 --> 01:49.790]  I'm going to go right to the first message.
[01:49.790 --> 01:50.790]  This one comes from ... You know what?
[01:50.790 --> 01:54.310]  I don't know if people want their names said on the show, so I'm not going to say your
[01:54.310 --> 01:58.150]  name, but I'm going to send everybody a big thank you and give everybody much love and
[01:58.150 --> 02:01.430]  respect for all of the responses I got from the listeners.
[02:01.430 --> 02:02.430]  Thank you.
[02:02.430 --> 02:04.430]  The listener interaction means a lot to me.
[02:04.430 --> 02:07.990]  This first message goes a lot like this.
[02:07.990 --> 02:09.910]  To me, 420 means community.
[02:09.910 --> 02:13.990]  It means normalization, decriminalization, and legalization.
[02:13.990 --> 02:17.550]  I first felt that over 20 years ago as a student in Vermont.
[02:17.550 --> 02:22.730]  Our sociology professor told us that on 420 at 420, it's a tradition for students to gather
[02:22.730 --> 02:27.090]  on campus in the main lawn and smoke together, celebrate together in public.
[02:27.090 --> 02:29.090]  The cops practiced tolerance that day.
[02:29.090 --> 02:33.450]  It was a beautiful, progressive thing to take part in, and that sense of community surrounding
[02:33.450 --> 02:36.610]  420 has always stuck with me.
[02:36.610 --> 02:41.330]  Then they wrapped up this message with a green heart emoji, which tops it all off beautifully.
[02:41.330 --> 02:43.490]  To this person, 420 represents community.
[02:43.490 --> 02:46.890]  I'm sure that we're going to see that as a trend in a lot of these messages.
[02:46.890 --> 02:51.210]  I love that colleges were accepting to the 420 movement.
[02:52.210 --> 02:56.210]  I appreciate that some of the professors and that the people at universities and colleges
[02:56.210 --> 03:00.130]  were tolerant and accepting and encouraging of the 420 movement.
[03:00.130 --> 03:02.710]  I find that to be quite progressive.
[03:02.710 --> 03:05.010]  Thank you for this great 420 message.
[03:05.010 --> 03:06.610]  Let's move on to the next one.
[03:06.610 --> 03:08.050]  This one comes from a good friend of the show.
[03:08.050 --> 03:09.410]  I don't know if they want their name said.
[03:09.410 --> 03:10.410]  You know what?
[03:10.410 --> 03:11.410]  This is from Grimbold the Druid.
[03:11.410 --> 03:14.010]  I know that's not his real name, so we can say that on the air.
[03:14.010 --> 03:15.250]  This message goes like this.
[03:15.250 --> 03:20.250]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, to me, 420 and other cannabis holidays are an opportunity to get together
[03:20.290 --> 03:25.130]  with my closest friends and family and appreciate this wonderful plant in one of the best ways
[03:25.130 --> 03:26.130]  I know how.
[03:26.130 --> 03:31.650]  Smoking as much as we comfortably or sometimes uncomfortably can handle and eating great
[03:31.650 --> 03:33.850]  food and enjoying each other's company.
[03:33.850 --> 03:36.530]  Keep up the great work from your friend Grimbold the Druid.
[03:36.530 --> 03:38.730]  Hey, Grim, thank you for the great message, dude.
[03:38.730 --> 03:43.090]  I always appreciate interacting with you, and I always appreciate your fine cannabis
[03:43.090 --> 03:44.090]  photography.
[03:44.090 --> 03:48.430]  Make sure you guys follow Grimbold the Druid on Instagram and check out his fine, fine
[03:48.430 --> 03:50.210]  cannabis photography.
[03:50.210 --> 03:51.210]  All right, let's keep moving.
[03:51.210 --> 03:53.210]  This next one comes from, let's see how they signed it.
[03:53.210 --> 03:56.210]  They don't use a fake name, so I'm just not going to give them a name.
[03:56.210 --> 04:00.330]  It says, Rasta Jeff, as always, I love your podcast.
[04:00.330 --> 04:01.330]  Keep it going, brother.
[04:01.330 --> 04:02.570]  Hey, I will do my best.
[04:02.570 --> 04:04.170]  I see no reason to stop.
[04:04.170 --> 04:06.130]  Can't stop, won't stop, so I'm going to keep it going, man.
[04:06.130 --> 04:07.730]  There's no reason to shut this down.
[04:07.730 --> 04:08.730]  We're at 420.
[04:08.730 --> 04:11.450]  I'm just going to keep pushing, so thanks for the encouragement.
[04:11.450 --> 04:15.530]  It goes on to say, so I've been smoking for the past 16 years of my life, and 420 has
[04:15.530 --> 04:20.610]  always been a day to hang with the bros and smoke in celebration of this amazing plant.
[04:20.610 --> 04:22.090]  We see more community coming up.
[04:22.090 --> 04:25.650]  The last three messages have all talked about hanging out with our friends during 420, so
[04:25.650 --> 04:26.650]  that's awesome.
[04:26.650 --> 04:29.330]  He wants to smoke in celebration of this amazing plant.
[04:29.330 --> 04:33.970]  Then he goes on to say, even in prohibition land, the love is still there.
[04:33.970 --> 04:38.810]  On 420, me and the dudes will have your podcast going and smoke one for you.
[04:38.810 --> 04:39.810]  Happy 420, brother.
[04:39.810 --> 04:40.810]  Hey, bros.
[04:40.810 --> 04:43.550]  Hey, guys, gathering around, smoking and listening.
[04:43.550 --> 04:44.650]  Thank you for bringing me to the party.
[04:44.770 --> 04:45.770]  I appreciate it.
[04:45.770 --> 04:48.130]  Man, I get to go to a lot of really cool 420 parties this year.
[04:48.130 --> 04:49.130]  This is going to be cool.
[04:49.130 --> 04:51.010]  I get to say I was at a lot of parties.
[04:51.010 --> 04:52.010]  You guys heard me.
[04:52.010 --> 04:53.010]  I was there.
[04:53.010 --> 04:54.010]  What's up, you guys?
[04:54.010 --> 04:55.010]  Then he ends the message.
[04:55.010 --> 04:56.010]  He says, happy 420, brother.
[04:56.010 --> 04:57.490]  Hey, happy 420 to you too.
[04:57.490 --> 04:58.610]  Then he continues.
[04:58.610 --> 04:59.610]  One last sentence.
[04:59.610 --> 05:03.250]  It says, as always, take a fat dab and hug your mom, and of course, shout out to White
[05:03.250 --> 05:04.250]  Mike.
[05:04.250 --> 05:05.250]  Hey, White Mike, you got a shout out.
[05:05.250 --> 05:07.490]  We may hear from White Mike toward the end of the episode.
[05:07.490 --> 05:08.650]  Happy 420 to White Mike.
[05:08.650 --> 05:11.550]  Hey, our friend that sent us this message, you know who you are, dude.
[05:11.550 --> 05:12.550]  Thank you.
[05:12.550 --> 05:14.870]  I appreciate you coming to the party with you and your bros.
[05:14.870 --> 05:17.030]  Also, bring some ladies to the party, dude.
[05:17.030 --> 05:18.230]  What kind of party is that?
[05:18.230 --> 05:19.990]  All right, let's move on.
[05:19.990 --> 05:22.270]  This one comes from, you know what I can say, this guy's name.
[05:22.270 --> 05:24.730]  This is from our friend Squishy McRosin.
[05:24.730 --> 05:30.070]  He says, hey, Jeff, I just wanted to share a 420 moment since you asked.
[05:30.070 --> 05:32.430]  To me, 420 means friends and family.
[05:32.430 --> 05:34.470]  I told you we would see a trend in here, you guys.
[05:34.470 --> 05:36.230]  To me, 420 means friends and family.
[05:36.230 --> 05:37.750]  I love hearing that.
[05:37.750 --> 05:42.190]  Long ago when I was 17, my dad had a heart attack just a few days before 420, and I had
[05:42.830 --> 05:46.630]  to travel to Vancouver for him to have an operation, and I missed a 420 celebration
[05:46.630 --> 05:48.150]  I had planned with my friends.
[05:48.150 --> 05:51.430]  Man, I really hope in the end of this story you tell me that your dad is okay.
[05:51.430 --> 05:53.230]  That's all I'm hoping for right now.
[05:53.230 --> 05:56.150]  It goes on to say, the operation went well.
[05:56.150 --> 05:57.150]  Oh, good.
[05:57.150 --> 05:58.150]  I'm relieved already.
[05:58.150 --> 06:00.030]  The operation went well for my dad, and everything checked out okay.
[06:00.030 --> 06:01.110]  I'm so glad to hear that.
[06:01.110 --> 06:03.070]  We can continue this message in peace now.
[06:03.070 --> 06:07.270]  He said, when I returned home, my friends had shown their support by planning a two-day
[06:08.270 --> 06:13.910]  420 makeup party in my honor, and they called it, and he says his real name, Fest.
[06:13.910 --> 06:17.030]  We're just going to say Squishy Fest and use his Instagram name here so we don't bust out
[06:17.030 --> 06:18.030]  his real name.
[06:18.030 --> 06:22.050]  Man, that is pretty cool that your friends gave you a two-day makeup 420 party.
[06:22.050 --> 06:25.690]  You missed the one-day main party, so instead you got two bonus days.
[06:25.690 --> 06:29.870]  Everyone had 420, then you got to have 422 and 23 or whatever, and it was a great time.
[06:29.870 --> 06:31.410]  That is cool that they did that.
[06:31.410 --> 06:33.190]  They gave you your own little fest.
[06:33.190 --> 06:34.370]  That is some really cool friends.
[06:34.370 --> 06:35.550]  Keep them around, bro.
[06:35.550 --> 06:36.550]  The message continues.
[06:36.550 --> 06:40.910]  It says, so now every year as 420 approaches, I'm reminded how thankful I am to still have
[06:40.910 --> 06:43.590]  my dad in my life now, 17 years later.
[06:43.590 --> 06:45.470]  Yeah, man, I'm glad he's still around with you.
[06:45.470 --> 06:46.470]  I hope you're enjoying that.
[06:46.470 --> 06:48.230]  I'm curious if you smoke with your dad.
[06:48.230 --> 06:50.630]  I'm really curious if you've crossed that line yet.
[06:50.630 --> 06:51.630]  The message continues.
[06:51.630 --> 06:55.990]  It says, and how great of friends I had to do that for me when my family was going through
[06:55.990 --> 06:56.990]  some shit.
[06:56.990 --> 06:59.710]  Yes, that is really cool that your family pulled it together, or your friends, they
[06:59.710 --> 07:00.710]  are your family.
[07:00.710 --> 07:01.710]  They pulled it together.
[07:01.710 --> 07:03.030]  They threw you a 420 party.
[07:03.030 --> 07:04.630]  They took your mind off of things.
[07:04.630 --> 07:07.510]  The best part is that dad's still around, so that is fucking cool.
[07:07.510 --> 07:11.630]  Hey, this year for 420, if you haven't already smoked with your dad, I dare you to spark
[07:11.630 --> 07:12.630]  up with dad.
[07:12.630 --> 07:13.630]  Good luck, dude.
[07:13.630 --> 07:15.190]  All right, I've got another message.
[07:15.190 --> 07:18.110]  We're going to go through these messages quite quickly, and then we may place some more audio
[07:18.110 --> 07:21.450]  messages, and then I'll talk about what 420 means to me.
[07:21.450 --> 07:23.430]  This one, they did not leave an alias.
[07:23.430 --> 07:26.130]  Oh, it says, feel free to use my name, so that makes it easy.
[07:26.130 --> 07:27.130]  The message goes like this.
[07:27.130 --> 07:28.130]  Hey, I love your show.
[07:28.130 --> 07:29.630]  I thank you for your show.
[07:29.630 --> 07:31.550]  It makes Monday another Friday.
[07:31.550 --> 07:32.550]  That's pretty cool.
[07:32.550 --> 07:36.190]  Sometimes Monday can be a pain in the ass for some people, and that's why I put out
[07:36.190 --> 07:39.830]  shows on Monday, because it makes Monday suck a little bit less for those people who have
[07:39.830 --> 07:42.110]  to go to a job they don't completely enjoy.
[07:42.110 --> 07:44.030]  That's cool that I'm making your Monday another Friday.
[07:44.030 --> 07:45.230]  That's pretty rad.
[07:45.230 --> 07:46.230]  The message keeps going.
[07:46.230 --> 07:48.430]  He says, you are smart, very smart.
[07:48.430 --> 07:49.950]  Then here's the part we are looking for.
[07:49.950 --> 07:54.810]  He says, 420 is to me a day that I'm going to take off work and literally wake up in
[07:54.810 --> 07:59.630]  bed with a joint rolled and a hot nail, and keep myself medicated all day, and hang out
[07:59.630 --> 08:01.270]  in smoke with my friends.
[08:01.270 --> 08:02.270]  There we go.
[08:02.990 --> 08:05.070]  He says, I'm a guy that is going to spend 420 with his friends.
[08:05.070 --> 08:06.570]  That's the way to do it.
[08:06.570 --> 08:08.790]  He says, friends that smoke or not.
[08:08.790 --> 08:12.270]  Then he also says, maybe go for a walk or cook something or both.
[08:12.270 --> 08:13.470]  Yeah, dude, definitely.
[08:13.470 --> 08:15.630]  Cook something, grub down, and then go for a walk.
[08:15.630 --> 08:16.630]  That sounds like a great idea.
[08:16.630 --> 08:18.790]  Then he says, shout out to you and White Mike.
[08:18.790 --> 08:19.790]  There you go, Mike.
[08:19.790 --> 08:20.790]  You got a shout out.
[08:20.790 --> 08:21.790]  Come take a dab, bro.
[08:21.790 --> 08:25.110]  Then he says, you guys are both awesome, and feel free to use my name from Brant.
[08:25.110 --> 08:26.990]  Hey, Brant, thanks for the great message.
[08:26.990 --> 08:29.910]  Thanks for sharing what 420 means to you.
[08:30.310 --> 08:32.310]  All right, this next message came in on my email.
[08:32.310 --> 08:35.750]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[08:35.750 --> 08:37.950]  It goes a little bit like this.
[08:37.950 --> 08:41.230]  420 brings me back to a special day.
[08:41.230 --> 08:45.590]  My name is Timmy, and I saw you on the Dude Grow Show on YouTube, and I have grabbed some
[08:45.590 --> 08:46.590]  of your beans.
[08:46.590 --> 08:53.830]  I am in New York City, so yeah, but my 420, my first 420 was when I was 19, and I'm 32
[08:53.830 --> 08:54.830]  now.
[08:54.830 --> 08:59.510]  Me and my homeboy got some purple, beautiful buds that I've never seen anything so pretty.
[09:00.110 --> 09:04.590]  Two years ago, my best friend overdosed on heroin three days before my birthday.
[09:04.590 --> 09:06.630]  That is a rough story already.
[09:06.630 --> 09:12.150]  Last year, I went and spent all my money on a trip by myself to the San Bernardino 420
[09:12.150 --> 09:13.150]  High Times Cannabis Cup.
[09:13.150 --> 09:14.150]  I had to stop myself.
[09:14.150 --> 09:16.270]  I wanted to say San Bernaduby.
[09:16.270 --> 09:20.350]  Went to the San Bernardino 420 High Times Cannabis Cup.
[09:20.350 --> 09:21.670]  You said, also, what a mess.
[09:21.670 --> 09:22.670]  You feel like you were ripped off.
[09:22.670 --> 09:23.910]  I'm not going to touch that statement.
[09:23.910 --> 09:25.990]  Then you say, but stay positive, I guess.
[09:25.990 --> 09:28.310]  Yes, stay positive that they were at least able to have that event.
[09:28.310 --> 09:30.230]  I understand that it did get weird that year.
[09:30.230 --> 09:32.990]  Things didn't go perfectly, but at least you got to go have a good time, be around the
[09:32.990 --> 09:34.990]  cannabis community, stay positive.
[09:34.990 --> 09:35.990]  That's all we can do.
[09:35.990 --> 09:41.190]  Then he goes on to say, I guess I've just shut down about growing, but cannabis just
[09:41.190 --> 09:42.190]  makes me happy.
[09:42.190 --> 09:45.550]  It gives me something to be happy about and makes me feel good, and I feel close to my
[09:45.550 --> 09:47.510]  homeboy on the day of 420.
[09:47.510 --> 09:51.390]  Yeah, I'm glad that 420 can bring back that connection to your friend that's no longer
[09:51.390 --> 09:52.390]  around.
[09:52.390 --> 09:55.830]  I'm hoping that you're surrounded by other good friends this year and that you're smoking
[09:55.830 --> 09:59.110]  something delicious and that you guys are laughing and remembering that your homeboy
[09:59.110 --> 10:00.950]  was there with you and had a bunch of good times with you.
[10:00.950 --> 10:01.950]  I hope you're doing all right.
[10:01.950 --> 10:04.430]  Man, if you want to hang out, send me an email.
[10:04.430 --> 10:06.310]  We'll take a virtual dab together.
[10:06.310 --> 10:07.310]  Let me know how you're doing, bro.
[10:07.310 --> 10:09.990]  I hope everything goes marvelously for you for this 420.
[10:09.990 --> 10:14.310]  I hope we can redeem that San Bernardino 420 because I know how that was.
[10:14.310 --> 10:15.310]  It'll get better, bro.
[10:15.310 --> 10:16.670]  All right, let's move forward.
[10:16.670 --> 10:17.990]  We've got another message.
[10:17.990 --> 10:21.270]  This one came to us from the YouTube channel.
[10:21.270 --> 10:26.270]  This one says, 420 means to me it is time to fire it up, bro, even if you smoke all
[10:26.270 --> 10:27.790]  day every day.
[10:27.790 --> 10:29.870]  That is from our friend James Butterson.
[10:29.870 --> 10:31.270]  Big shout out to James Butterson.
[10:31.270 --> 10:34.070]  Always the first one to leave a comment on the YouTube videos.
[10:34.070 --> 10:35.070]  Much appreciated.
[10:35.070 --> 10:36.070]  Big respect.
[10:36.070 --> 10:37.070]  Let's see.
[10:37.070 --> 10:38.670]  I think we have another one here on the phone.
[10:38.670 --> 10:39.750]  There are two more, I think.
[10:39.750 --> 10:41.270]  This one goes like this.
[10:41.270 --> 10:46.070]  I currently shift work between 60 to 90 hours a week.
[10:46.070 --> 10:48.350]  Dude, are you a fucking machine?
[10:48.350 --> 10:49.350]  That is crazy.
[10:49.350 --> 10:50.550]  Take a break, my man.
[10:50.550 --> 10:53.110]  I would like to one day only work 20 hours a week.
[10:53.110 --> 10:55.390]  Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
[10:55.390 --> 10:56.550]  One day you'll have to, bro.
[10:56.550 --> 11:01.990]  Then he says he'd like to work no more than four days and be off every afternoon by 420.
[11:01.990 --> 11:05.590]  Then he says, 420 is when I get to chill and relax.
[11:05.590 --> 11:07.310]  Hey, that's a great one.
[11:07.310 --> 11:08.630]  Man, you work too hard.
[11:08.630 --> 11:10.750]  You work hard for that 420 break.
[11:10.750 --> 11:14.490]  I bet that is nice after 60 to 90 hours of work.
[11:14.490 --> 11:15.810]  That is tremendous.
[11:15.810 --> 11:16.810]  That is putting it in.
[11:16.810 --> 11:18.590]  You really do deserve that smoke.
[11:18.590 --> 11:19.990]  That is medical marijuana.
[11:20.430 --> 11:22.590]  I don't know if you're smoking for recreational purposes.
[11:22.590 --> 11:24.110]  That's medical at that point.
[11:24.110 --> 11:25.110]  You deserve it, bro.
[11:25.110 --> 11:29.110]  And thanks for the update on what 420 means to you.
[11:29.110 --> 11:30.930]  All right, podcast world.
[11:30.930 --> 11:34.710]  Those were all of the listener submissions about what 420 means to you.
[11:34.710 --> 11:38.930]  I think it is time for me to tell you what 420 means to me, and then we will play a couple
[11:38.930 --> 11:42.070]  of audio clips from some of our friends.
[11:42.070 --> 11:43.550]  What does 420 mean to me?
[11:43.550 --> 11:44.870]  420 means a lot of things to me.
[11:44.870 --> 11:51.310]  I have been involved in participating in celebrating 420 for a very long time.
[11:51.310 --> 11:55.310]  I probably actually discovered the phrase 420 early in high school, probably around
[11:55.310 --> 11:56.870]  eighth or ninth grade.
[11:56.870 --> 12:01.790]  My first Phish show was in 95, and I know we were talking about 420 at Phish shows.
[12:01.790 --> 12:05.430]  So 420, I've been celebrating, talking about participating.
[12:05.430 --> 12:08.270]  I've been in the 420 scene since the early 90s.
[12:08.270 --> 12:14.070]  420 has evolved and changed into a lot of different things over the years as I have
[12:14.270 --> 12:18.150]  When I first discovered 420, like most of us, it was kind of the way that me and my
[12:18.150 --> 12:22.150]  bros would tell each other, you want to go smoke some weed without everybody else knowing
[12:22.150 --> 12:24.230]  that we were going to go smoke some weed.
[12:24.230 --> 12:25.230]  That didn't last very long.
[12:25.230 --> 12:28.830]  When you're a high school kid and you think you've got some code, it's not good code.
[12:28.830 --> 12:31.190]  If you're a high school kid and you're listening, you should not be listening.
[12:31.190 --> 12:34.190]  But if you've got some code that you think your teachers or your parents or somebody
[12:34.190 --> 12:37.670]  know that means we're going to go do something stupid, everybody knows you're going to go
[12:37.670 --> 12:38.670]  do something fucking stupid.
[12:38.670 --> 12:39.670]  Your code's not working.
[12:39.670 --> 12:44.310]  So 420 was our little code that me and Rob or me and Chris or all of us would be somewhere
[12:44.310 --> 12:46.590]  and we'd say, I think it's pretty close to 420.
[12:46.590 --> 12:48.590]  And other people would look at their clock and say, it's only 115.
[12:48.590 --> 12:51.090]  I don't know what these dumbasses are talking about.
[12:51.090 --> 12:54.790]  But most of the other people that knew, anybody that was cool, sometimes too many people that
[12:54.790 --> 12:57.030]  weren't cool, would look at us and go, oh yeah, it's 420.
[12:57.030 --> 12:59.890]  And they would come with us or they would ruin our 420 plan.
[12:59.890 --> 13:03.870]  So back in the day when it started, that was our way to say, let's go smoke, bro.
[13:03.870 --> 13:07.590]  It was almost time to go sneak away, go smoke a bowl together, go get the crew together
[13:07.590 --> 13:09.110]  and have a good time.
[13:09.550 --> 13:10.990]  And then people started catching on.
[13:10.990 --> 13:13.790]  Then it started getting really, really popular.
[13:13.790 --> 13:18.550]  Then around the same time that 420 got super popular and super commercialized, I was entering
[13:18.550 --> 13:21.190]  the commercial cannabis industry.
[13:21.190 --> 13:26.550]  That is where my view, my stance, my opinion of 420 shifted a little bit.
[13:26.550 --> 13:30.550]  When you work in the commercial cannabis industry, if you were in the production side, if you
[13:30.550 --> 13:34.550]  were in the commercial side, especially if you were in the packaging side or the retail
[13:34.550 --> 13:37.590]  side, 420 can be a headache.
[13:37.590 --> 13:38.710]  It is a pain in the ass.
[13:39.630 --> 13:44.030]  A lot of my friends, this is the week of 420, and I'm not going to see a lot of my friends
[13:44.030 --> 13:47.750]  because they're working overtime, they're stuck at work getting prepared, they're running
[13:47.750 --> 13:48.950]  420 sales.
[13:48.950 --> 13:52.790]  Many of my friends that are running their own businesses are away at conventions trying
[13:52.790 --> 13:54.470]  to manage their business.
[13:54.470 --> 13:59.830]  420 gets hectic when you were in the cannabis business and you've got responsibilities.
[13:59.830 --> 14:03.190]  About two weeks before 420, we started getting prepared.
[14:03.190 --> 14:06.110]  We have got to roll all of the pre-rolls.
[14:06.110 --> 14:10.790]  People come from all over the damn planet to Colorado and they all want a pre-roll.
[14:10.790 --> 14:12.910]  We have got to start rolling pre-rolls.
[14:12.910 --> 14:16.710]  All of the employees that don't have something to do are put on a pre-roll station, start
[14:16.710 --> 14:17.710]  rolling joints.
[14:17.710 --> 14:18.710]  We need all of them.
[14:18.710 --> 14:20.710]  There's a lot of pre-rolls to be done.
[14:20.710 --> 14:22.990]  There's a lot of preparation like packaging.
[14:22.990 --> 14:26.990]  All of the concentrates you buy, they all come in ridiculous amounts of packaging.
[14:26.990 --> 14:30.270]  They have to be weighed by somebody, they have to be packaged by somebody.
[14:30.270 --> 14:31.510]  Somebody has to do all of that.
[14:31.510 --> 14:34.830]  We sell a lot of product over the 420 holiday season.
[14:34.830 --> 14:36.470]  Everybody is putting those products together.
[14:36.470 --> 14:41.310]  Around the 1st of April, we start and they'll be continuing through April 20th.
[14:41.310 --> 14:45.430]  Then on 421, they have to start doing it all over to restock the shelves because we wipe
[14:45.430 --> 14:47.950]  it clean on 420.
[14:47.950 --> 14:48.950]  It's great.
[14:48.950 --> 14:49.950]  Don't get me wrong.
[14:49.950 --> 14:52.290]  It's great for the industry, but for the people who are part of it, it is a headache.
[14:52.290 --> 14:55.350]  It is like the Christmas rush for the weed industry.
[14:55.350 --> 14:57.030]  It is like the mall at Christmas time.
[14:57.030 --> 15:00.710]  It is like wherever you go to buy fancy shit, it's like Best Buy.
[15:00.710 --> 15:01.710]  It's like the mall.
[15:01.710 --> 15:03.630]  It's like Guitar Center at Christmas time.
[15:03.630 --> 15:04.630]  It is hectic.
[15:05.430 --> 15:07.230]  People who are working there have that deer in the headlights sort of look.
[15:07.230 --> 15:09.390]  They just wish they could get a break so they could go smoke.
[15:09.390 --> 15:10.430]  It is hectic.
[15:10.430 --> 15:13.430]  The traffic starts about two weeks before.
[15:13.430 --> 15:14.750]  Everything starts going on sale.
[15:14.750 --> 15:15.910]  The prices change.
[15:15.910 --> 15:17.970]  New customers start coming.
[15:17.970 --> 15:19.710]  Everything is more chaotic.
[15:19.710 --> 15:21.630]  It kind of changes your whole opinion.
[15:21.630 --> 15:26.390]  Oh, also, a lot of times as it gets closer to 420, there'll be a fucking DJ at your work,
[15:26.390 --> 15:29.270]  DJing, spinning terrible music that you're trying to work over.
[15:29.270 --> 15:33.550]  You got while you're trying to sell a gram to some guy from Texas that doesn't know anything
[15:33.550 --> 15:34.550]  about cannabis.
[15:34.550 --> 15:38.230]  I know I'm talking about how terrible it is, but once you've done it a couple of years
[15:38.230 --> 15:41.510]  in a row, you kind of think, oh, God, it's 415.
[15:41.510 --> 15:43.950]  I don't want to go to work this week.
[15:43.950 --> 15:46.390]  So that's what it's like once you enter the cannabis industry.
[15:46.390 --> 15:49.670]  If you work in the retail side, you kind of just want to punch yourself in the face from
[15:49.670 --> 15:53.190]  about April 10th right through about April 22nd.
[15:53.190 --> 15:57.270]  Then, I've kind of shifted my position in the cannabis industry.
[15:57.270 --> 15:58.710]  I still work with a lot of grows.
[15:58.710 --> 16:01.270]  I still do a lot of things in the cannabis industry.
[16:01.270 --> 16:03.230]  I'm not so involved in that retail side.
[16:03.910 --> 16:05.710]  I'm not so involved and immersed in all the people.
[16:05.710 --> 16:10.630]  I've become sort of a hermit in my old age, which is fucking great with me.
[16:10.630 --> 16:13.510]  The less people, the less places, the less drama and bullshit.
[16:13.510 --> 16:14.990]  Let's stick to the point.
[16:14.990 --> 16:18.310]  I've kind of changed my stance since I am not so heavily involved.
[16:18.310 --> 16:21.470]  I don't have to be anywhere that I don't really want to be at this point.
[16:21.470 --> 16:24.430]  420 now, I miss what it used to be.
[16:24.430 --> 16:27.590]  I miss when me and my bros could nudge each other and go, you down for a little 420?
[16:27.590 --> 16:29.830]  Like, I don't got any weed, but I got some weed.
[16:29.830 --> 16:30.830]  Let's go do some 420.
[16:31.350 --> 16:32.350]  One of your friends would just...
[16:32.350 --> 16:34.230]  Oh, remember the pagers back in the day?
[16:34.230 --> 16:36.950]  Your pager would go off and it would have your friend's phone number and then it would
[16:36.950 --> 16:37.950]  just say 420.
[16:37.950 --> 16:40.390]  Then, it would have a couple of other numbers.
[16:40.390 --> 16:43.590]  We knew that if you put these four numbers, that was the Burger King over on the South
[16:43.590 --> 16:46.310]  side because those are the four numbers for the payphone and the Burger King.
[16:46.310 --> 16:50.670]  If you text me, you say 420, the last four digits of the phone number, the payphone at
[16:50.670 --> 16:51.670]  the Burger King.
[16:51.670 --> 16:54.870]  I know we're going to go smoke some bowls in the parking lot at Burger King pretty soon.
[16:54.870 --> 16:55.870]  I'll meet you there.
[16:55.870 --> 16:56.870]  I miss those days.
[16:56.870 --> 16:57.870]  That was kind of cool.
[16:57.870 --> 17:00.710]  Being a sneaky stoner was fun.
[17:01.590 --> 17:02.590]  Now that it's not even...
[17:02.590 --> 17:03.590]  I don't know.
[17:03.590 --> 17:04.590]  Everybody's just smoking weed everywhere.
[17:04.590 --> 17:05.590]  It's not even sneaky anymore.
[17:05.590 --> 17:06.590]  I don't know.
[17:06.590 --> 17:10.750]  Something about hiding it made it a little bit more fun and I miss that code and that
[17:10.750 --> 17:11.750]  time.
[17:11.750 --> 17:14.590]  Maybe I just miss that time period because we were fucking 17 and didn't have to worry
[17:14.590 --> 17:17.390]  about anything, but I miss that part of it.
[17:17.390 --> 17:21.990]  Now, being the opposite end of that, being an adult where I don't have to hide 420 from
[17:21.990 --> 17:26.750]  anybody at this point, the law, my parents, the teacher, nobody cares.
[17:26.750 --> 17:30.190]  You can smoke a fat dab and walk into class and as long as you can stare at the teacher
[17:30.670 --> 17:31.670]  properly, they don't give a shit.
[17:31.670 --> 17:34.630]  As long as you paid your tuition and you showed up, nobody even cares.
[17:34.630 --> 17:36.910]  So it's completely different.
[17:36.910 --> 17:40.830]  It's like when your favorite band puts out that album and you go, oh, yeah, I'm probably
[17:40.830 --> 17:42.750]  not going to listen to them so much anymore.
[17:42.750 --> 17:44.750]  It's kind of that same feeling for 420.
[17:44.750 --> 17:45.750]  Don't get me wrong.
[17:45.750 --> 17:46.750]  I love 420.
[17:46.750 --> 17:47.750]  I'm smoking down.
[17:47.750 --> 17:48.750]  It's 419 and my eyes are red.
[17:48.750 --> 17:49.750]  I'm a little goofy.
[17:49.750 --> 17:52.070]  We're going to have a great 420, but it is different now.
[17:52.070 --> 17:53.870]  I'm an old guy.
[17:53.870 --> 17:56.270]  I don't need the code.
[17:56.270 --> 17:57.270]  I don't need that stuff.
[17:57.270 --> 17:58.590]  So it's fun to go to the shows.
[17:58.590 --> 17:59.590]  It is great to smoke.
[17:59.990 --> 18:01.670]  I love the communal feeling of it.
[18:01.670 --> 18:06.950]  It is a little overhyped in Colorado because it is almost like they know all of the businesses
[18:06.950 --> 18:08.910]  know it's 420 time.
[18:08.910 --> 18:13.270]  There is a burger joint that is selling a burger with CBD in the sauce.
[18:13.270 --> 18:19.190]  Everybody is advertising blatant 420 advertising any product that could be used by a cannabis
[18:19.190 --> 18:20.190]  consumer.
[18:20.190 --> 18:24.110]  They're pointing at you with some 420 style advertising in Colorado.
[18:24.110 --> 18:27.510]  So it's a little overdone in my opinion, but I still love it.
[18:27.510 --> 18:28.510]  Don't get me wrong.
[18:28.510 --> 18:29.510]  I still love it.
[18:30.430 --> 18:33.510]  I still smoke every day at 420 and especially even harder on 420.
[18:33.510 --> 18:34.510]  So I love 420.
[18:34.510 --> 18:35.510]  I'm all about the 420.
[18:35.510 --> 18:39.110]  I used to have a shirt that looked like it had the 7-11 logo on it, but it actually said
[18:39.110 --> 18:41.710]  four or had the number four and said 20 on the bottom of it.
[18:41.710 --> 18:43.950]  Had it real big on the back everywhere I went.
[18:43.950 --> 18:44.950]  All the hippies love that shit.
[18:44.950 --> 18:46.670]  They're like, I love your 420 shirt, bro.
[18:46.670 --> 18:48.390]  And then we would smoke together.
[18:48.390 --> 18:49.710]  Then in the future I evolved.
[18:49.710 --> 18:54.070]  I got the one that looked like it said 7-11, but it actually said 7-10 because 7-10 is
[18:54.070 --> 18:55.310]  the new 420.
[18:55.310 --> 18:57.670]  We got a couple of months till we talk about that.
[18:57.670 --> 18:59.310]  So that is in a nutshell.
[18:59.310 --> 19:01.990]  My feelings about 420 and what 420 means to me.
[19:01.990 --> 19:07.230]  I appreciate all of your contributions and your emails, your messages, your YouTube comments,
[19:07.230 --> 19:08.230]  any way you reached out.
[19:08.230 --> 19:10.870]  Thank you for telling me what 420 means to you.
[19:10.870 --> 19:14.630]  I've got a couple of audio clips I'm going to play from friends of ours that want to
[19:14.630 --> 19:16.950]  tell us what 420 means to them.
[19:16.950 --> 19:19.950]  Before we get there, let's go old school.
[19:19.950 --> 19:22.030]  Let's talk about where 420 originated.
[19:22.030 --> 19:23.310]  We've all got our own ideas.
[19:23.310 --> 19:25.350]  It all means something cool to all of us.
[19:25.350 --> 19:28.670]  Let's talk about the originators of 420.
[19:29.030 --> 19:33.630]  In the early 70s in San Rafael, California, there were a group of dudes who called themselves
[19:33.630 --> 19:34.630]  the Waldos.
[19:34.630 --> 19:35.910]  You may have heard of these dudes.
[19:35.910 --> 19:37.750]  Just a normal group of dudes.
[19:37.750 --> 19:42.710]  Every day at 420, this group of dudes known as the Waldos would meet up at a spot after
[19:42.710 --> 19:44.870]  school and guess what they would do?
[19:44.870 --> 19:47.830]  They would get down on a fat joint or a fat bull.
[19:47.830 --> 19:51.030]  It just happened to be 420 because that's when everybody got out of class and that's
[19:51.030 --> 19:52.510]  when they could all get together.
[19:52.510 --> 19:56.630]  So their code was, hey, you want to get together for a little 420?
[19:56.630 --> 19:58.150]  And from there it really caught on.
[19:58.630 --> 20:01.110]  The Waldos were also known for being deadheads.
[20:01.110 --> 20:04.750]  So the phrase 420 traveled quickly through deadhead culture.
[20:04.750 --> 20:07.150]  Deadheads love to have some sort of a cool catchphrase.
[20:07.150 --> 20:11.390]  Anything to say something without saying the real word in deadhead culture is always a
[20:11.390 --> 20:12.670]  really catchy thing to do.
[20:12.670 --> 20:15.970]  So it spread like wildfire through the deadhead culture.
[20:15.970 --> 20:20.070]  In the 80s, deadhead culture started becoming like pop culture.
[20:20.070 --> 20:21.690]  It was just becoming mainstream.
[20:21.690 --> 20:25.830]  So that introduced 420 to the mainstream, which made it spread through the high school
[20:25.830 --> 20:28.130]  kids where it became even more popular.
[20:29.110 --> 20:33.850]  I discovered it in high school and through the fish community at fish shows.
[20:33.850 --> 20:37.290]  When I said 420 at a fish show, everybody definitely knew what I meant.
[20:37.290 --> 20:39.050]  So big shout out to the Waldos.
[20:39.050 --> 20:40.810]  I don't want to blow all of their story.
[20:40.810 --> 20:44.850]  They've got a website and their website is 420waldos.com.
[20:44.850 --> 20:47.730]  If you were more interested in the Waldos, I encourage you to check out their website.
[20:47.730 --> 20:48.730]  It is kind of neat.
[20:48.730 --> 20:49.730]  It is kind of fun.
[20:49.730 --> 20:54.770]  There is a lot of archival evidence that can show how far back the phrase 420 went.
[20:54.770 --> 20:57.610]  They show how far back they've been calling themselves the Waldos.
[20:57.610 --> 21:00.250]  And they show how they link themselves to the Grateful Dead.
[21:00.250 --> 21:03.810]  So it is a really fun website if you're interested in the 420 culture.
[21:03.810 --> 21:06.210]  So I've told you what 420 means to me.
[21:06.210 --> 21:09.410]  We have talked about what 420 means to a lot of our listeners.
[21:09.410 --> 21:12.670]  I have edumacated you on where 420 came from.
[21:12.670 --> 21:17.130]  Now I think it is time to play some clips from some of our friends about 420.
[21:17.130 --> 21:19.810]  All right, first off, happy 420, Mike.
[21:19.810 --> 21:20.810]  Thanks for joining me.
[21:20.810 --> 21:21.810]  Yeah, man.
[21:21.810 --> 21:25.850]  So I am asking everybody, what does 420 mean to you?
[21:25.850 --> 21:28.330]  You, like myself, have been in and out of the cannabis industry.
[21:28.330 --> 21:29.730]  You've been around for quite a while.
[21:29.730 --> 21:31.130]  Also, you're an old dude.
[21:31.130 --> 21:36.290]  So can you tell me, what does 420 mean to you?
[21:36.290 --> 21:40.130]  It's a big, it's a community holiday.
[21:40.130 --> 21:42.530]  When I was younger, I went kind of wild with it.
[21:42.530 --> 21:49.770]  But that was in the heyday where tens of thousands of people would gather up at CU Boulder on
[21:49.770 --> 21:54.490]  Norlin Lawn, or when hundreds of thousands of people, or 100,000 people would gather
[21:54.490 --> 21:57.290]  in downtown Denver at Civic Center.
[21:57.290 --> 22:04.810]  No concerts, no promotion, no food vending, just a giant, massive smokeout in the bad
[22:04.810 --> 22:08.770]  old prohibition days because we could in mass numbers.
[22:08.770 --> 22:10.330]  Sort of a civil protest, if you will.
[22:10.330 --> 22:16.570]  It was the only real act of civil disobedience I got to participate in in my generation.
[22:16.570 --> 22:17.810]  Still a great rite of passage.
[22:17.810 --> 22:19.690]  Oh, it was awesome.
[22:19.690 --> 22:24.450]  I vividly remember the first time I went up to CU Boulder and participated in the smokeout
[22:24.450 --> 22:25.450]  on 420.
[22:25.450 --> 22:27.490]  It was insane.
[22:27.490 --> 22:32.770]  Just people everywhere, cops everywhere, people with cameras everywhere.
[22:32.770 --> 22:37.850]  The school really didn't want the event to take place, but there's nothing you can do
[22:37.850 --> 22:42.530]  when 10,000 or more people decide that they're going to show up at a place at a time and
[22:42.530 --> 22:43.530]  do a thing.
[22:43.530 --> 22:44.530]  Absolutely.
[22:44.530 --> 22:45.530]  Power in numbers.
[22:45.530 --> 22:46.530]  How old were you at that time?
[22:46.530 --> 22:51.450]  I think the first time I went up there, I was 18.
[22:51.450 --> 22:52.450]  Cool.
[22:53.450 --> 22:58.570]  I mean, that was like in 2000 when there was no medical yet.
[22:58.570 --> 23:00.410]  Cali had been medical.
[23:00.410 --> 23:03.810]  Colorado had just passed medical, but it didn't mean anything.
[23:03.810 --> 23:10.810]  There were no doctors, no cards, no MED, no medical marijuana program yet.
[23:10.810 --> 23:12.010]  Everything was black market.
[23:12.010 --> 23:15.250]  Everything was illegal, basically, unless you were one of those rare med patients that
[23:15.250 --> 23:18.130]  we had here, but that was brand new, so there weren't many.
[23:18.130 --> 23:24.770]  There were almost no medical patients in the early 2000s, 2001, two, three, four.
[23:24.770 --> 23:27.770]  So you were 18 and that's what 420 was for you then.
[23:27.770 --> 23:32.490]  It was sort of a holiday, a cultural holiday, and also a great day.
[23:32.490 --> 23:33.490]  That was the one day that-
[23:33.490 --> 23:35.290]  It was a mass protest.
[23:35.290 --> 23:40.650]  The beautiful thing about those events in their original incarnation was all of these
[23:40.650 --> 23:42.530]  people would show up.
[23:42.530 --> 23:47.490]  They would commit what was considered a serious crime together.
[23:47.850 --> 23:53.850]  Shooting pot in public was not something that didn't get you handcuffed and dragged off.
[23:53.850 --> 23:57.090]  And it still is that way in a lot of places, so we take it for granted that it's not like
[23:57.090 --> 23:58.090]  that still.
[23:58.090 --> 24:05.610]  But at the time, it was a serious crime and it was sort of absurd that this was a crime.
[24:05.610 --> 24:12.170]  And so having all those people come together, hang out for a couple of hours in the afternoon,
[24:12.170 --> 24:16.090]  it's usually half decent on 420.
[24:16.090 --> 24:17.090]  Sometimes it's brutal cold.
[24:17.090 --> 24:19.850]  We're going to get lucky this year.
[24:19.850 --> 24:20.850]  It's going to be beautiful.
[24:20.850 --> 24:21.850]  God, I hope so.
[24:21.850 --> 24:24.010]  It's been beautiful the last couple of days.
[24:24.010 --> 24:26.810]  But the first couple of times I went up to 420, it was gorgeous.
[24:26.810 --> 24:28.810]  The weather was nice.
[24:28.810 --> 24:36.610]  It was just astounding to see all those people gather, hang out, chill until like 418.
[24:36.610 --> 24:40.690]  And then the whole crowd kind of stands up and starts cheering and hooting.
[24:40.690 --> 24:44.810]  Right at 420, everybody lights up and there's just this massive cloud.
[24:44.810 --> 24:48.450]  And then by five o'clock, everybody's gone.
[24:48.450 --> 24:55.050]  And there's like 15 little groups of ones and twos walking around picking up trash.
[24:55.050 --> 24:57.190]  And there's no traffic snarls.
[24:57.190 --> 24:59.010]  There's no bodies on the highway.
[24:59.010 --> 25:01.250]  There's no pandemonium later.
[25:01.250 --> 25:04.010]  It was just an awesome act of civil disobedience.
[25:04.010 --> 25:07.610]  And then when I went down to Civic Center the next couple of years, because I used to
[25:07.610 --> 25:14.370]  go every year, we'd take the light rail into downtown and just watch the show all afternoon.
[25:14.930 --> 25:19.970]  But seeing 100,000 people all light up right in front of the state capitol is something
[25:19.970 --> 25:24.450]  that you should definitely see in person if you haven't seen it.
[25:24.450 --> 25:28.430]  But I stopped going the more corporate-y it got.
[25:28.430 --> 25:34.930]  When there was a promoter and concerts and a couple of terrible vending attempts, it
[25:34.930 --> 25:40.130]  just lost its appeal or it lost its hook for me.
[25:40.130 --> 25:41.850]  That makes a lot of sense.
[25:41.850 --> 25:45.570]  I see how it has gone from, and I'm going to talk about this when I say what it means
[25:45.570 --> 25:46.570]  to me.
[25:46.570 --> 25:48.170]  I don't want to step on your part here.
[25:48.170 --> 25:51.650]  But I see how it has definitely gone from the thing that was what the bros did.
[25:51.650 --> 25:52.930]  It was kind of the download thing.
[25:52.930 --> 25:54.250]  The potheads were doing it.
[25:54.250 --> 25:55.970]  And now 420 is an event.
[25:55.970 --> 26:00.170]  We go rent space and we say, hey, city, we're going to hold a 420 rally.
[26:00.170 --> 26:01.170]  So it has definitely evolved.
[26:01.170 --> 26:03.170]  I see how you're talking about corporate.
[26:03.170 --> 26:09.450]  So Mike, did working in the cannabis industry change your outlook and your opinion on 420?
[26:09.450 --> 26:14.890]  If you work in the industry, especially on the retail side, 420 is just a nightmare.
[26:14.890 --> 26:20.410]  It's like working Christmas if you've worked regular retail.
[26:20.410 --> 26:25.530]  It's pandemonium, just endless lines, whatever sales going on.
[26:25.530 --> 26:27.570]  The whole week leading up is just nuts.
[26:27.570 --> 26:28.650]  Two weeks this year.
[26:28.650 --> 26:30.090]  It seems like it's been two weeks ahead.
[26:30.090 --> 26:33.770]  It's like every holiday, it's getting drugged further and further down the calendar.
[26:33.770 --> 26:36.290]  It is added to the list of holidays.
[26:36.290 --> 26:38.890]  In most states, they don't get the extra holiday that we get here.
[26:39.330 --> 26:40.330]  We have sales.
[26:40.330 --> 26:42.930]  Every store has a sale right around 420.
[26:42.930 --> 26:47.530]  Any store that could apply, the grocery store, the restaurants, the restaurants where stoners
[26:47.530 --> 26:50.610]  go, the pizza joints, all those places are having a sale right now.
[26:50.610 --> 26:56.290]  They may not blatantly say 420 sale, but we all know all the advertising is green.
[26:56.290 --> 26:58.470]  It's all the week before and after 420.
[26:58.470 --> 26:59.610]  We all know what it is.
[26:59.610 --> 27:04.330]  It's really neat to see that all of mainstream culture is kind of catching on.
[27:04.330 --> 27:09.450]  The disappointing example of that that I just saw was Carl's Jr. CBD sauce on one of
[27:09.450 --> 27:10.450]  their burgers.
[27:10.450 --> 27:12.010]  I was like, no, you're fucking failing at life right now.
[27:12.010 --> 27:13.290]  I don't know if that's even real.
[27:13.290 --> 27:14.290]  Is that real?
[27:14.290 --> 27:15.290]  It's 100% real.
[27:15.290 --> 27:24.210]  There's one location in Denver and for $4.20 on 420, you can get one of their burgers in
[27:24.210 --> 27:25.290]  their secret sauce.
[27:25.290 --> 27:28.530]  They're infusing fucking CBD for that one burger.
[27:28.530 --> 27:31.490]  I want to get one of these burgers and take it to a lab and have it tested and see how
[27:31.490 --> 27:32.930]  much CBD is in this burger.
[27:32.930 --> 27:33.930]  I'm just curious.
[27:34.530 --> 27:36.210]  Interesting game, right?
[27:36.210 --> 27:37.210]  Just curious.
[27:37.210 --> 27:38.210]  They're advertising it.
[27:38.210 --> 27:39.210]  It's got to be in there.
[27:39.210 --> 27:40.210]  CBD is everywhere.
[27:40.210 --> 27:43.010]  No, it's the next big pile on.
[27:43.010 --> 27:44.010]  It is.
[27:44.010 --> 27:49.210]  I saw a meme on social media that said folks in Colorado be like my Subaru runs on CBD
[27:49.210 --> 27:51.330]  and that is absolutely fucking accurate.
[27:51.330 --> 27:54.890]  All right, Mike, we are all stepping all over your little segment here in this show.
[27:54.890 --> 27:59.170]  I just wanted to give you a couple of brief moments to tell us what 420 means to you.
[27:59.170 --> 28:01.710]  We've talked about it as you were a youngster.
[28:01.710 --> 28:05.670]  As you started off in your activism, you went to a peaceful civil disobedience, kind
[28:05.670 --> 28:06.670]  of a protest.
[28:06.670 --> 28:07.670]  Many of them.
[28:07.670 --> 28:08.670]  I've got some good old footage.
[28:08.670 --> 28:11.990]  I used to like to stand in the crowd and do the slowly turning a circle.
[28:11.990 --> 28:12.990]  Yeah, and you're tall.
[28:12.990 --> 28:13.990]  I like to do that too.
[28:13.990 --> 28:14.990]  Being a tall guy, that's a fun one.
[28:14.990 --> 28:16.790]  Then it became kind of commercialized.
[28:16.790 --> 28:18.310]  You quit going to the events.
[28:18.310 --> 28:22.270]  For a couple of years, like myself, you were tied up at a location, either working retail
[28:22.270 --> 28:27.190]  and then a couple of the years you were working at the Grow with me for at least one 420.
[28:27.190 --> 28:29.470]  Now that you're kind of an older dude, you're a parent.
[28:29.470 --> 28:33.710]  You're not really in the industry per se, but you are still on the fringe.
[28:33.710 --> 28:35.710]  What is the word I'm looking for?
[28:35.710 --> 28:37.070]  Tertiary.
[28:37.070 --> 28:38.070]  You were kind of in the industry.
[28:38.070 --> 28:39.070]  You're right near it.
[28:39.070 --> 28:41.030]  You're on the, you're industry adjacent.
[28:41.030 --> 28:44.310]  How does 420, what does 420 mean to you these days?
[28:44.310 --> 28:49.110]  Honestly, it's just another day in my book.
[28:49.110 --> 28:55.230]  I don't have any plans to hit up a big event or to go up to Civic Center or any of that
[28:55.230 --> 28:56.230]  nonsense.
[28:56.230 --> 28:58.310]  Just way too much at this point.
[28:58.310 --> 29:02.670]  If the kids are chilling at 420, you might run to the dad's safe room and take a quick
[29:02.670 --> 29:03.670]  puff at 420.
[29:03.670 --> 29:07.470]  If not, then not.
[29:07.470 --> 29:12.470]  It's not like I'm missing the tradition of a family dinner or something like that with
[29:12.470 --> 29:16.510]  a lot of other holidays where it's like, if I just stopped doing Thanksgiving, there's
[29:16.510 --> 29:20.430]  other parts than just stuff about the holiday that I would miss.
[29:20.430 --> 29:24.030]  With 420, it's just another day in my book.
[29:24.030 --> 29:30.030]  It's fun that the community has a date to focus on and kind of go all out with, but
[29:30.030 --> 29:32.870]  most of the stuff I see now, I just shake my head at.
[29:32.870 --> 29:33.870]  All right, Mike.
[29:33.870 --> 29:39.750]  Man, that was a great kind of an overview of your beginning of 420, the middle of 420,
[29:39.750 --> 29:43.230]  your retail 420, and now the definitely old man Mike 420.
[29:43.230 --> 29:46.590]  Good perspective there.
[29:46.590 --> 29:48.830]  It's a holiday on the date.
[29:48.830 --> 29:49.990]  It's a time code.
[29:49.990 --> 29:50.990]  It's a number.
[29:51.430 --> 29:57.870]  When I was in high school, it was cute to write 420 on your notebook and shit, but since
[29:57.870 --> 30:01.790]  I was 15, it was as good as wearing a shirt that said pothead.
[30:01.790 --> 30:02.790]  Absolutely.
[30:02.790 --> 30:07.030]  No one was confused about the number 420 except the most ignorant among us.
[30:07.030 --> 30:08.030]  Just the nerds.
[30:08.030 --> 30:09.470]  And they were confused about everything.
[30:09.470 --> 30:10.470]  All right, Mike.
[30:10.470 --> 30:15.950]  I want to thank you for joining me for this quick 420 segment in the 420 episode.
[30:15.950 --> 30:16.950]  It is 420.
[30:16.950 --> 30:18.950]  We are celebrating 420 here.
[30:18.950 --> 30:23.030]  There's nothing left to do but to turn off these microphones and let's enjoy some 420.
[30:23.030 --> 30:24.030]  It's 430, y'all.
[30:24.030 --> 30:27.830]  Well, we're going to smoke some flour and some dabs here in honor of 420.
[30:27.830 --> 30:30.630]  So ladies and gentlemen, I'll be right back to keep the show moving.
[30:30.630 --> 30:32.310]  Thanks for joining me, Mike.
[30:32.310 --> 30:33.310]  Yeah, man.
[30:33.310 --> 30:36.270]  Yo, yo, big up Rasta Jeff.
[30:36.270 --> 30:38.470]  This is Coot Dog from the Mystic Roots.
[30:38.470 --> 30:40.990]  And my name is Pato Banton.
[30:40.990 --> 30:43.990]  We're giving shout outs to say what 420 means to us.
[30:43.990 --> 30:45.550]  I'll go first.
[30:45.670 --> 30:50.310]  420 to me is a day where people get together to celebrate the magical herb.
[30:50.310 --> 30:51.870]  It's a peaceful day.
[30:51.870 --> 30:56.750]  I'd say it's a day of peace around all the world where people can relax and fire up,
[30:56.750 --> 31:01.310]  enjoy however they prefer, whether it's edible or if it's a smoke or even if it's without
[31:01.310 --> 31:03.950]  any ganja, just to feel the vibes of 420.
[31:03.950 --> 31:05.870]  That's what 420 means to me.
[31:05.870 --> 31:12.030]  For me, Pato Banton, 420 is something that happens twice every day.
[31:12.030 --> 31:16.710]  Once in the evening at 420 and once in the morning at 420.
[31:16.710 --> 31:21.870]  And every year, annually, 420 is when the whole world come together to celebrate the
[31:21.870 --> 31:26.830]  healing of the nation and to remind each other that we should take away the stigma from this
[31:26.830 --> 31:29.630]  beautiful plant and remember that it is a medicine.
[31:29.630 --> 31:35.030]  It is a natural herb and there's nothing wrong with partaking of this beautiful medication.
[31:35.030 --> 31:36.030]  Peace.
[31:36.030 --> 31:38.030]  Yes, big up Rasta Jeff from Coot Dog.
[31:38.030 --> 31:39.030]  Yes, Rasta Jeff.
[31:39.030 --> 31:40.030]  Pato Banton.
[31:40.030 --> 31:40.530]  Blup, blup, blup, blup.
[31:42.030 --> 31:45.910]  All right, Podcast World, that is what 420 means to three of my favorite people.
[31:45.910 --> 31:47.190]  We got White Mike in there.
[31:47.190 --> 31:49.230]  We got Big Coot from Mystic Roots in there.
[31:49.230 --> 31:52.110]  And then we got Mr. Pato Banton and their Spreading the Love.
[31:52.110 --> 31:55.990]  Big thanks to all three of them for their contribution to the show.
[31:55.990 --> 31:58.910]  Podcast World, I think that is all I have got for you for this 420 episode.
[31:58.910 --> 32:01.310]  I want to thank you again for listening to me.
[32:01.310 --> 32:04.710]  I hope you had a wonderful or are having a wonderful 420.
[32:04.710 --> 32:06.710]  I hope you're smoking something delicious.
[32:06.710 --> 32:08.930]  I hope you're hanging out with great people.
[32:08.930 --> 32:12.210]  If you were in Prohibition Land, I hope you were staying safe.

[33:10.030 --> 33:14.050]  Ladies and gentlemen, I usually wrap up the show by giving one person a giant shout out.
[33:14.050 --> 33:18.130]  I want to give a giant shout out to the entire 420 community worldwide.
[33:18.130 --> 33:23.570]  If you are smoking, growing, advocating, participating, admiring, if you are involved in any cannabis
[33:23.570 --> 33:27.010]  in any way, big shout out, big giant fist bump to you.
[33:27.010 --> 33:30.490]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[33:34.170 --> 33:36.970]  Now this one is dedicated to the people all over.
[33:36.970 --> 33:40.090]  Listen to the words of your crucial entertainer.
[33:40.090 --> 33:44.170]  When I say I do not sniff no coke, I only smoke the Sensible.
[34:28.810 --> 34:31.610]  I do not sniff the coke, I only smoke Sensible.
[34:31.610 --> 34:34.410]  I do not sniff the coke, I only smoke Sensible.
[34:34.410 --> 34:37.210]  I do not sniff the coke, I only smoke Sensible.
[34:37.210 --> 34:39.610]  I do not sniff the coke, I only smoke Sensible.
[34:39.610 --> 34:42.810]  Without a doubt I am the boss and in my class I am the teacher.
[34:42.810 --> 34:45.610]  If music is the fruit of life, then I will be a reaper.
[34:45.610 --> 34:48.410]  If MC Business was a school, then I would be a master.
[34:48.410 --> 34:49.810]  If a car, I'd be the driver.
[34:49.810 --> 34:51.210]  If a bike, I'd be the rider.
[34:51.210 --> 34:54.010]  If MC Business was a church, Pato would be the vicar.
[34:54.010 --> 34:56.810]  Then instead of calling me MC, you all would call me preacher.
[34:56.810 --> 34:59.610]  But fun and joke aside, I won't get serious in this matter.
