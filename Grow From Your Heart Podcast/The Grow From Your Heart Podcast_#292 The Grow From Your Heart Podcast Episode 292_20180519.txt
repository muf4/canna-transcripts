[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Rasta Jeff, you bad motherfucker.
[00:02.000 --> 00:06.720]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:06.720 --> 00:09.920]  It's time for a Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:09.920 --> 00:13.800]  I like to call these Thursday episodes the Thursday Quickie.
[00:13.800 --> 00:17.000]  These quickies are brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[00:17.000 --> 00:19.280]  Make sure you check them out at dankseed.store.
[00:19.280 --> 00:23.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a quickie unless we get started right away, so let's
[00:23.880 --> 00:26.400]  get on with the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:26.400 --> 00:29.280]  All right, podcast world.
[00:29.280 --> 00:31.520]  Thanks again for joining me for another Thursday quickie.
[00:31.520 --> 00:33.020]  Before I get too far, let me apologize.
[00:33.020 --> 00:34.880]  I know that my voice sounds like shit.
[00:34.880 --> 00:36.000]  I'm a little dried out.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.240]  My voice is a little rough.
[00:37.240 --> 00:38.560]  I do apologize.
[00:38.560 --> 00:43.440]  It's because I smoked a whole bunch of joints with our friend Baker at Comedy Works.
[00:43.440 --> 00:44.440]  Shout out to Baker.
[00:44.440 --> 00:46.400]  Had a great weekend up there at Comedy Works.
[00:46.400 --> 00:48.080]  We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:48.080 --> 00:50.400]  I like to start the podcast by talking about what I've been smoking on.
[00:50.400 --> 00:52.640]  Of course, I was smoking flowers this weekend.
[00:52.640 --> 00:54.520]  I'm not known for smoking a lot of flower.
[00:54.520 --> 00:56.720]  I'm known for smoking a lot of concentrates.
[00:56.720 --> 01:02.800]  This weekend, I smoked dog waltz and star dog flowers grown in the Three Rivers Commercial
[01:02.800 --> 01:04.480]  Grow grown by myself and my grow team.
[01:04.480 --> 01:05.480]  Shout out to the whole grow staff.
[01:05.480 --> 01:07.840]  Shout out to everyone at the grow.
[01:07.840 --> 01:13.440]  But also, I've been dabbing on this Lemon OG live resin from our friends at the Garden
[01:13.440 --> 01:14.440]  of Wheaton.
[01:14.440 --> 01:15.440]  It is amazing, you guys.
[01:15.440 --> 01:20.840]  I'm going to crack open the jar and give it a smell and try to give you a nice description.
[01:20.840 --> 01:22.440]  It smells ... It's Lemon OG.
[01:22.440 --> 01:25.360]  It's got a very lemon smell to the top of it.
[01:25.360 --> 01:31.700]  As soon as you crack it open, it smells like sweet lemons, sweet, sour, tangy lemons.
[01:31.700 --> 01:33.160]  It's got a very strong lemon smell.
[01:33.160 --> 01:36.880]  Now, often when I talk about lemons, I talk about that dry lemon smell like a Lemonhead
[01:36.880 --> 01:42.280]  candy or like the Country Time Lemonade dry powdered smell.
[01:42.280 --> 01:47.080]  This has a wet lemon smell and not in a bad way, like a juicy lemon smell.
[01:47.080 --> 01:48.880]  It kind of smells like a Jolly Rancher.
[01:48.880 --> 01:52.200]  When you put a Jolly Rancher in your mouth and it kind of makes you drool from that lemon
[01:52.200 --> 01:54.800]  flavor, it's doing that same thing to my tongue.
[01:54.800 --> 01:58.560]  It's kind of giving me the lemon essence Jolly Rancher candy.
[01:58.560 --> 01:59.560]  Want to drool.
[01:59.560 --> 02:02.120]  Now I want a Jolly Rancher candy real bad.
[02:02.120 --> 02:03.120]  That's what it's doing to me.
[02:03.120 --> 02:04.520]  It's got that lemon smell to it.
[02:04.520 --> 02:11.320]  But then, once you get past that sharp punch in the face of lemons, there's this hint of
[02:11.320 --> 02:14.880]  cushy gassiness, earthiness at the bottom of it.
[02:14.880 --> 02:16.620]  It just blends really well with the lemons.
[02:16.620 --> 02:19.920]  The lemons kind of mute out the gassiness, but the gassiness brings out the lemons, I
[02:19.920 --> 02:20.920]  think.
[02:20.920 --> 02:21.920]  It is very well done.
[02:21.920 --> 02:22.920]  Shout out to my friend, Spence.
[02:22.920 --> 02:26.840]  Shout out to the whole crew at the Garden of Weden for hooking me up with some delicious
[02:26.840 --> 02:29.120]  lemon OG concentrates here.
[02:29.120 --> 02:30.120]  All right.
[02:30.120 --> 02:32.660]  Now that you guys know what I'm smoking on, let's get some business out of the way.
[02:32.660 --> 02:35.960]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[02:35.960 --> 02:36.960]  Company.
[02:36.960 --> 02:37.960]  That's right.
[02:37.960 --> 02:40.960]  If you need to add some new genetics to your garden, look no further than the Hella Dank
[02:40.960 --> 02:41.960]  Seed Company.
[02:41.960 --> 02:43.960]  You can visit them at dankseed.store.
[02:43.960 --> 02:47.000]  All right, you guys.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.560]  I owe everybody listening to this podcast a huge thank you.
[02:51.560 --> 02:53.400]  This podcast is available on iTunes.
[02:53.400 --> 02:55.120]  The podcast is available on Stitcher.
[02:55.120 --> 02:57.040]  The podcast is available on my website.
[02:57.040 --> 02:59.040]  Since I'm talking about my website, let me apologize.
[02:59.040 --> 03:00.360]  I know it looks like shit.
[03:00.360 --> 03:01.840]  I am not a web guy.
[03:01.840 --> 03:02.840]  It exists.
[03:02.840 --> 03:06.160]  That website right now is mainly used to host the podcast.
[03:06.160 --> 03:07.960]  I know it needs a lot of updates.
[03:07.960 --> 03:11.280]  I simply don't know how to do it myself, and if I did know how to do it, I don't know if
[03:11.280 --> 03:12.280]  I would have the time.
[03:12.280 --> 03:14.640]  So, I apologize for the shitty looking website.
[03:14.640 --> 03:19.760]  Anyway, the podcast is available on iTunes, Stitcher, my website, and it's available on
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.120]  dozens of other random podcast hosting sites.
[03:23.120 --> 03:28.200]  Now, iTunes and Stitcher and YouTube are pretty much the statistics that I pay attention to.
[03:28.200 --> 03:32.200]  I look at my website sometimes, but you guys don't listen on the website a whole bunch.
[03:32.200 --> 03:36.840]  It kind of looks like iTunes and Stitcher are the most used services.
[03:36.840 --> 03:41.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was blown away when I checked my statistics on Stitcher last week
[03:41.240 --> 03:47.080]  because the show in the month of February has already reached over 90,000 downloads
[03:47.080 --> 03:48.800]  on Stitcher alone.
[03:48.840 --> 03:53.720]  I'm going to reach over 100,000 downloads for the month of February.
[03:53.720 --> 03:54.960]  I haven't paid much attention.
[03:54.960 --> 04:00.000]  I don't think I've hit 100,000 downloads in one month before on one service.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.000]  That is amazing.
[04:01.000 --> 04:02.280]  That's tremendous.
[04:02.280 --> 04:03.280]  It blows my mind.
[04:03.280 --> 04:05.800]  Thank you guys for downloading and listening to my podcast.
[04:05.800 --> 04:07.120]  Thank you for all the support.
[04:07.120 --> 04:13.280]  I never thought that this little show was going to get listened to by 90,000 people.
[04:13.280 --> 04:14.280]  That's overwhelming.
[04:14.280 --> 04:15.280]  That's, uh...
[04:15.280 --> 04:16.280]  No, you know what?
[04:16.280 --> 04:17.280]  It's not overwhelming.
[04:17.280 --> 04:18.280]  It's inspiring.
[04:18.280 --> 04:19.280]  I love it.
[04:19.280 --> 04:22.320]  I've been overwhelmed before and this is a different feeling.
[04:22.320 --> 04:24.080]  This is inspiring.
[04:24.080 --> 04:25.080]  This is motivating.
[04:25.080 --> 04:29.880]  I never thought that a large football stadium worth of people would download my podcast
[04:29.880 --> 04:30.880]  and listen.
[04:30.880 --> 04:34.800]  So, all 90,000 of you that downloaded the podcast on Stitcher this month, it'll reach
[04:34.800 --> 04:35.800]  100,000.
[04:35.800 --> 04:39.680]  I'm confident that I will reach 100,000 downloads on Stitcher this month.
[04:39.680 --> 04:42.480]  To all 100,000 of you, thank you.
[04:42.480 --> 04:46.440]  Also, if you're not listening on Stitcher, if you're on iTunes, if you're on PodBay,
[04:46.440 --> 04:49.920]  if you're on PodCaster, if you're listening wherever, thank you.
[04:49.920 --> 04:54.200]  I truly appreciate it and I am blown away that this podcast has gotten this far.
[04:54.200 --> 04:56.440]  You guys, we're almost to 300 episodes.
[04:56.440 --> 04:59.200]  I was stoked to make it to 100.
[04:59.200 --> 05:01.880]  I was blown away to make it to 250.
[05:01.880 --> 05:06.760]  300 is really going to mean something and I see no end in sight anytime soon, you guys.
[05:06.760 --> 05:10.120]  So, 90,000 downloads on Stitcher, that's what I wanted to brag about.
[05:10.120 --> 05:14.360]  Holy shit, we're going to hit 100,000 downloads on one service this month, you guys.
[05:14.360 --> 05:15.520]  Thank you.
[05:15.600 --> 05:19.480]  If you guys keep listening, I promise to keep bringing you quality content.
[05:19.480 --> 05:20.480]  All right.
[05:20.480 --> 05:22.040]  Now, let's move forward a little bit.
[05:22.040 --> 05:24.480]  I want to talk about what I did over the weekend.
[05:24.480 --> 05:27.480]  I know I get to keep coming on here and bragging about all the cool shit that I do.
[05:27.480 --> 05:30.480]  Sorry, I don't mean to brag, but I got to brag.
[05:30.480 --> 05:33.000]  This weekend, you guys, I got to go see Uncle Joey.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.240]  I got to see Joey Coco Diaz at the finest comedy club on the planet.
[05:37.240 --> 05:39.920]  That's right, Joey Diaz was at the Comedy Works.
[05:39.920 --> 05:40.920]  He was there all weekend.
[05:40.920 --> 05:42.840]  He did Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night.
[05:42.840 --> 05:45.280]  He sold out two shows every night.
[05:46.040 --> 05:48.200]  I got to go to the early Saturday show.
[05:48.200 --> 05:50.120]  So Saturday, I drove up to Denver.
[05:50.120 --> 05:53.160]  I find a nice parking spot over there at Writers Square.
[05:53.160 --> 05:54.600]  I head into the comedy show.
[05:54.600 --> 05:57.680]  I get myself some pretzels and a root beer, and I get all set up.
[05:57.680 --> 05:59.200]  The comedy show comes on.
[05:59.200 --> 06:04.280]  The host at Comedy Works that night was Aaron Urist, who is always hilarious.
[06:04.280 --> 06:10.160]  The opening act was a comedian named Elliot, who I am spacing on his last name.
[06:10.160 --> 06:11.680]  I knew it until I started recording.
[06:11.680 --> 06:13.000]  I'm going to press pause and find it.
[06:13.000 --> 06:14.000]  Hold on.
[06:14.000 --> 06:15.120]  But you guys, I can't find his name anywhere.
[06:15.960 --> 06:16.960]  His name is Elliot.
[06:16.960 --> 06:17.960]  He is a regular at Comedy Works.
[06:17.960 --> 06:21.000]  He is a very tall guy, and he was very hilarious.
[06:21.000 --> 06:25.880]  If you get to see a tall guy named Elliot at Comedy Works, he's fucking great.
[06:25.880 --> 06:26.880]  I recommend him.
[06:26.880 --> 06:29.000]  Anyhow, Aaron Urist opened.
[06:29.000 --> 06:30.560]  Aaron's always reliably funny.
[06:30.560 --> 06:34.120]  Elliot, I've seen a couple of times, always reliably funny.
[06:34.120 --> 06:37.400]  But after Elliot's set is when the party really got started.
[06:37.400 --> 06:41.120]  You guys, I listen to a podcast called The Church of What's Happening Now, which is where
[06:41.120 --> 06:43.520]  Joey Diaz gets to do most of his ranting.
[06:43.520 --> 06:46.440]  But he's joined by a producer named Lee Syatt.
[06:46.440 --> 06:51.080]  Lee also produces the Good Times podcast with Steve Simone.
[06:51.080 --> 06:52.800]  He used to host his own podcast.
[06:52.800 --> 06:56.320]  He was part of another podcast with Johnny Rock called Life in Neutral.
[06:56.320 --> 07:02.920]  Anyway, Lee has been a podcasting engineer and producer in LA for quite a few years now.
[07:02.920 --> 07:07.500]  He's also becoming very well known in the podcasting world and the comedy world because
[07:07.500 --> 07:12.520]  he hangs out with Steve Simone, Joey Diaz, Ari Shaffir, Joe Rogan.
[07:12.520 --> 07:14.280]  He's in that comedy realm.
[07:14.280 --> 07:17.520]  Of course, the dude has started writing and doing comedy.
[07:17.520 --> 07:21.280]  If you listen to his podcast that he's on, you know that he's very new into comedy and
[07:21.280 --> 07:23.920]  he's only got about seven minutes of time total.
[07:23.920 --> 07:29.060]  Well, I happen to be paying attention to him on Twitter and on the podcast, and they kept
[07:29.060 --> 07:31.800]  saying that Lee was coming to Denver with Uncle Joey.
[07:31.800 --> 07:35.200]  Now, I didn't know if he was going to come do standup or if he was just going to come
[07:35.200 --> 07:36.560]  hang out.
[07:36.560 --> 07:40.400]  Friday night, he did not do standup, so I didn't expect anything.
[07:40.400 --> 07:46.680]  But Saturday night, after the MC and after the opener, they brought out Mr. Lee Syatt,
[07:46.680 --> 07:50.160]  the Flying Jew, to come do a few minutes of comedy.
[07:50.160 --> 07:51.760]  He did about three to five minutes.
[07:51.760 --> 07:54.820]  I tried not to watch the clock too hard, but I did try to pay attention.
[07:54.820 --> 07:59.880]  He did about three to five minutes, and I could see how visibly nervous he was, but
[07:59.880 --> 08:01.800]  he was fucking hilarious.
[08:01.800 --> 08:06.080]  That dude crushed it for how new at comedy he is, and he's just a shy, nervous person
[08:06.080 --> 08:07.080]  in general.
[08:07.080 --> 08:11.920]  To see that dude talk about doing comedy one day on the podcast, I went and did my first
[08:11.920 --> 08:12.920]  open mic.
[08:12.920 --> 08:14.880]  He talks about, I did three minutes the other night.
[08:14.880 --> 08:18.600]  I just got to see this guy make the biggest level up in his life.
[08:18.600 --> 08:20.460]  Lee just jumped levels.
[08:20.460 --> 08:22.460]  Lee has now performed at the Comedy Store.
[08:22.460 --> 08:24.280]  Lee has now performed at Comedy Works.
[08:24.280 --> 08:28.160]  He's been on stage and crushed at the two best clubs on the planet.
[08:28.160 --> 08:31.640]  So shout out, congratulations to Lee Syatt.
[08:31.640 --> 08:36.120]  And also, holy crap, I was so excited to see Lee come do comedy.
[08:36.160 --> 08:37.160]  He crushed it.
[08:37.160 --> 08:40.920]  He actually pulled a move that I don't think he realized how smooth it was.
[08:40.920 --> 08:45.360]  One of the acts before him told a joke, and I'm going to kind of ruin the guy's material,
[08:45.360 --> 08:46.720]  but I won't ruin it all.
[08:46.720 --> 08:50.880]  He invented a new name for giving a woman blue balls, and he calls it flooding her basement.
[08:50.880 --> 08:53.600]  All right, that's just a quick premise.
[08:53.600 --> 08:57.680]  Lee actually came out on stage and talked about himself for a minute, and then said,
[08:57.680 --> 08:58.680]  look at me.
[08:58.680 --> 09:00.520]  I've never flooded anyone's basement.
[09:00.520 --> 09:03.580]  And for a comedian to pull something back like that is gold.
[09:03.580 --> 09:04.920]  So he's on the right path.
[09:04.920 --> 09:06.240]  It was fucking hilarious.
[09:06.240 --> 09:07.680]  I was super excited.
[09:07.680 --> 09:11.520]  I did not realize that Lee Syatt is about the height of a bar stool.
[09:11.520 --> 09:13.960]  That dude might be four foot two or something.
[09:13.960 --> 09:16.440]  That is a short little man.
[09:16.440 --> 09:19.600]  Holy crap, I was amazed to see how tiny he was.
[09:19.600 --> 09:21.440]  But Lee did about three or four minutes.
[09:21.440 --> 09:22.800]  He crushed it.
[09:22.800 --> 09:24.880]  Then he did the honors.
[09:24.880 --> 09:28.240]  He shifted from his material into, all right, ladies and gentlemen, you know him from the
[09:28.240 --> 09:29.920]  Church of What's Happening Now.
[09:29.920 --> 09:37.360]  And then he brought out Joey Coco Diaz, who is one of my top five, maybe top three favorite
[09:37.360 --> 09:40.560]  living comedians that I've ever fucking listened to.
[09:40.560 --> 09:44.640]  Joey makes me laugh until weird parts of my body hurt.
[09:44.640 --> 09:47.560]  Joey makes me laugh until weird parts of my head hurt.
[09:47.560 --> 09:52.120]  I wasn't sure what part inside of me was giving me a sharp pain, but I was laughing so hard
[09:52.120 --> 09:56.720]  that I almost wanted to just stop laughing for a minute.
[09:56.720 --> 09:58.880]  I wanted to like, oh, how do I snap out of this?
[09:58.880 --> 10:02.080]  Because it was uncomfortably, painfully hilarious.
[10:02.080 --> 10:03.680]  I was laughing my ass off.
[10:03.680 --> 10:07.200]  I didn't have to pee, but I thought I might piss my pants from laughter.
[10:07.200 --> 10:08.280]  It was so good.
[10:08.280 --> 10:09.600]  So he introduces Joey.
[10:09.600 --> 10:14.560]  And you guys, when Joey walks out on stage, he comes out with the most tremendous energy.
[10:14.560 --> 10:17.720]  He just walks out on stage and he just looks at the crowd like, what's up, fuckers?
[10:17.720 --> 10:20.120]  And he does this really cool strut move.
[10:20.120 --> 10:22.120]  This guy's 53 years old.
[10:22.120 --> 10:23.280]  He's Cuban.
[10:23.280 --> 10:24.720]  He's from North Bergen, New Jersey.
[10:24.720 --> 10:28.520]  So he's got this East Coaster vibe to him and he comes out on stage and he struts and
[10:28.520 --> 10:32.400]  he grabs the mic and he goes, what's up, you bad motherfuckers.
[10:32.400 --> 10:34.720]  And that club fucking erupted.
[10:34.720 --> 10:37.880]  You guys, I have seen no shit.
[10:37.880 --> 10:39.840]  50 over 50 shows.
[10:39.840 --> 10:42.360]  I've seen Doug Benson 20 times at comedy works.
[10:42.360 --> 10:46.260]  You guys, I have been to over 50 shows at comedy works.
[10:46.260 --> 10:47.260]  No problem.
[10:47.260 --> 10:49.800]  Maybe closer to a hundred shows at comedy works.
[10:49.800 --> 10:55.000]  And Joey Diaz gets that place roaring like nobody fucking else.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.840]  The only person that got close was Chappelle and it's a different thing.
[10:58.840 --> 11:03.400]  The thing that Joey Diaz brings, it feels like the roof is going to come off the fucking
[11:03.400 --> 11:04.400]  building.
[11:04.400 --> 11:06.520]  He'll have you in stitches laughing.
[11:06.520 --> 11:09.920]  He'll tell a punchline and you'll be crying, laughing, you're holding your gut.
[11:09.920 --> 11:11.320]  And then he'll throw a tag onto that.
[11:11.320 --> 11:12.320]  Just one more little.
[11:12.320 --> 11:13.320]  And so then I did this.
[11:13.320 --> 11:15.920]  And then you're like, oh shit, it can't go any further.
[11:15.920 --> 11:17.660]  And then he'll, then he'll make another one.
[11:17.660 --> 11:18.660]  And then I did this.
[11:18.660 --> 11:21.620]  And then you're like, oh God damn it, Joe, you better stop.
[11:21.620 --> 11:22.620]  And then he'll let it go.
[11:22.620 --> 11:24.180]  And he'll just pause and stare into the crowd.
[11:24.180 --> 11:26.020]  Cause he knows I don't have to say anything.
[11:26.020 --> 11:27.940]  They're fucking laughing their asses off.
[11:27.940 --> 11:29.180]  I'm paid to make these people laugh.
[11:29.180 --> 11:30.660]  I'm going to let them laugh.
[11:30.660 --> 11:33.780]  And then as soon as the laughter starts to kind of, you know, when people laugh, they
[11:33.780 --> 11:34.780]  ha ha ha ha ha.
[11:34.780 --> 11:38.260]  And then you get the, Oh, you do that weird inhale noise, laugh.
[11:38.260 --> 11:40.700]  Oh, like you're going to settle down and you're not laughing anymore.
[11:40.700 --> 11:41.700]  Okay.
[11:41.700 --> 11:42.700]  I'm done.
[11:42.700 --> 11:43.700]  Huh?
[11:43.700 --> 11:45.780]  As soon as people do that noise, he grabs the microphone stand and picks it up and I'm
[11:45.780 --> 11:46.780]  going to do it.
[11:46.780 --> 11:49.780]  He picks it up about three or four inches up off the floor and smacks it on the ground.
[11:49.780 --> 11:51.740]  And he goes, ha.
[11:51.740 --> 11:55.460]  And when he does it, it's like the fucking troublemaker kid at school just got caught
[11:55.460 --> 11:56.980]  doing something, but doesn't care.
[11:56.980 --> 11:59.780]  He's like, ah, I'm going to get detention, whatever it was worth it.
[11:59.780 --> 12:01.380]  Cause you're all laughing at me.
[12:01.380 --> 12:02.780]  He does that.
[12:02.780 --> 12:04.660]  And it's, it's cheap.
[12:04.660 --> 12:07.260]  It's a cheap ass comedy move, but it's genuine.
[12:07.260 --> 12:10.120]  It's if it were disingenuous, I would call him on it.
[12:10.120 --> 12:12.900]  It is just Joey's way of going, ha, look, you bad motherfuckers.
[12:12.900 --> 12:14.800]  We're friends and we're laughing together.
[12:14.800 --> 12:16.880]  It is so fucking funny when he does it.
[12:16.880 --> 12:17.880]  So he'll hit you.
[12:17.880 --> 12:18.880]  He'll tag you again.
[12:18.880 --> 12:19.880]  He'll tag you again.
[12:19.880 --> 12:23.120]  And when you finally think you're coming out of that water and getting there, he'll slam
[12:23.120 --> 12:25.660]  that microphone stand on the ground and go, ha.
[12:25.660 --> 12:26.840]  And then you're busted again.
[12:26.840 --> 12:29.920]  I fucking laughed so hard at uncle Joey.
[12:29.920 --> 12:33.560]  Joey told Joey tells some filthy jokes.
[12:33.560 --> 12:35.040]  Maybe that's why I like him.
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.720]  Joey has a dirty mouth and a dirty mind, but he's honest.
[12:38.720 --> 12:39.720]  And that's part of what I love.
[12:39.720 --> 12:45.920]  But anyway, Joey told a nice long story that was tremendous and people were offended and
[12:45.920 --> 12:49.640]  people were disgustingly laughing or like, I can't believe you just said that shit in
[12:49.640 --> 12:51.120]  front of 250 people.
[12:51.120 --> 12:55.040]  Uncle Joey, that shit you might want to keep private and everybody's laughing and he's
[12:55.040 --> 12:56.320]  making this face that he makes.
[12:56.320 --> 13:00.240]  He opens his mouth and shakes his head so that his bottom jaw flops back and forth and
[13:00.240 --> 13:02.000]  he looks at you like, ah, it's funny.
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.400]  And it's really, really is funny.
[13:03.400 --> 13:04.840]  But then he goes, it's Saturday night.
[13:04.840 --> 13:07.640]  You motherfuckers, you want to hear knock, knock jokes.
[13:07.640 --> 13:11.360]  For that man to realize that we were at our limit and then just try to push us a little
[13:11.360 --> 13:14.800]  more is just so, it's so amazing the way he works the crowd.
[13:14.800 --> 13:17.320]  Joey brings energy that nobody else fucking brings.
[13:17.320 --> 13:19.400]  So I got to see Joey again.
[13:19.400 --> 13:25.240]  Unfortunately, there was another show afterward, so we didn't have the regular outside smoke
[13:25.240 --> 13:27.360]  sesh that we usually have.
[13:27.360 --> 13:30.880]  Things had to be a little more contained, so it wasn't a big party like normal.
[13:30.880 --> 13:34.000]  However, I did have a very good time.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.340]  Shout out to all my friends at comedy works that take very good care of me.
[13:38.040 --> 13:39.940]  You guys, I keep saying it and they don't pay me to say this at all.
[13:39.940 --> 13:42.100]  I pay for all of my comedy works tickets.
[13:42.100 --> 13:43.660]  I pay for all my food there.
[13:43.660 --> 13:44.900]  They don't sponsor me in any way.
[13:44.900 --> 13:46.180]  I just fucking love it.
[13:46.180 --> 13:51.300]  I recommend that everybody, wherever you are, go see comedy at a comedy club, go support
[13:51.300 --> 13:54.660]  live comedy, go support a comedian, go see what it's like.
[13:54.660 --> 13:56.980]  It'll be one of the funnest nights you've had in a while.
[13:56.980 --> 14:00.700]  All right, you guys, I feel like that's enough bragging about my weekend, enough talking
[14:00.700 --> 14:01.700]  about comedy.
[14:01.700 --> 14:05.900]  Let's actually read an email that has something to do with some cannabis.
[14:06.620 --> 14:08.420]  All right, podcast world.
[14:08.420 --> 14:11.940]  This email comes from our friend Ben Osborne, and it goes like this.
[14:11.940 --> 14:15.340]  He starts off right away and says, feel free to use my name and the name of the company
[14:15.340 --> 14:17.580]  that I work for if you read this on the podcast.
[14:17.580 --> 14:19.060]  Hey, Ben, thank you.
[14:19.060 --> 14:21.260]  That makes life so easy.
[14:21.260 --> 14:22.260]  This one's from Ben.
[14:22.260 --> 14:23.260]  It goes like this.
[14:23.260 --> 14:25.980]  Dear Ross DeJeff, let me start by thanking you for everything you don't know you've done
[14:25.980 --> 14:27.060]  for me.
[14:27.060 --> 14:30.460]  Almost two years ago, I decided to get into the cannabis industry as a grower.
[14:30.460 --> 14:34.980]  I've had terrible luck growing anything throughout my life, killing just about everything I touched.
[14:35.980 --> 14:39.980]  I felt that with proper knowledge and enough effort that I would be able to be successful
[14:39.980 --> 14:41.100]  in my grow.
[14:41.100 --> 14:43.700]  My love for cannabis is a very strong driving force.
[14:43.700 --> 14:44.700]  I think you know the feeling.
[14:44.700 --> 14:46.380]  Yes, sir, I certainly do know that feeling.
[14:46.380 --> 14:48.900]  He said, after all, it saved my life.
[14:48.900 --> 14:53.260]  I was hired at the clinic about a year and a half ago as a trimmer.
[14:53.260 --> 14:57.060]  As of about three months ago, partially thanks to the knowledge that the podcast has bestowed
[14:57.060 --> 14:58.820]  on me, I made it into the grow.
[14:58.820 --> 15:02.540]  Hey, dude, congratulations, because I always talk about everybody having to start off as
[15:02.540 --> 15:04.940]  a trimmer, and you were proving exactly my point.
[15:04.980 --> 15:06.300]  You got hired as a trimmer.
[15:06.300 --> 15:07.900]  You showed that you knew what to do.
[15:07.900 --> 15:10.620]  You showed that you could listen and show up on time, and now you worked your way up
[15:10.620 --> 15:11.620]  and you were in the grow.
[15:11.620 --> 15:12.620]  Congratulations, dude.
[15:12.620 --> 15:15.300]  I'm glad you have made that step, level up.
[15:15.300 --> 15:19.540]  Then he also says, Ross DeJeff, thanks to you, I am able to communicate with the people
[15:19.540 --> 15:23.260]  on my team with confidence that I would have otherwise lacked.
[15:23.260 --> 15:24.780]  Dude, that's pretty cool.
[15:24.780 --> 15:30.220]  I'm glad that you're able to use the knowledge and information that I've given you and communicate
[15:30.220 --> 15:31.220]  with these people.
[15:31.220 --> 15:35.420]  I'm sure that when you said specific words and said them in a certain way that they realized,
[15:35.420 --> 15:38.740]  hey, this guy knows what he's talking about, and it got you some respect in the grow.
[15:38.740 --> 15:42.260]  Man, I'm glad that worked for you, and I'm proud of you for jumping up so quickly.
[15:42.260 --> 15:43.540]  I'm going to continue with the email.
[15:43.540 --> 15:44.540]  It goes like this.
[15:44.540 --> 15:50.180]  Now, the main reason for this email, I recently went to the Grow Off Awards party in Denver.
[15:50.180 --> 15:52.860]  We won first place in yield and flavor this year.
[15:52.860 --> 15:53.860]  Dude, congrats.
[15:53.860 --> 15:54.860]  That's a huge award.
[15:54.860 --> 15:57.900]  If you won best yield and best flavor, that's a good job.
[15:57.900 --> 15:58.900]  Congratulations.
[15:58.900 --> 16:04.340]  This email also goes on to say, Phylos Bioscience had a display with the Phylos Bioscience Galaxy.
[16:04.340 --> 16:05.900]  I'll say that again, you guys.
[16:05.900 --> 16:12.100]  Phylos, P-H-Y-L-O-S, Bioscience Galaxy, the Phylos Bioscience Galaxy.
[16:12.100 --> 16:14.660]  He said, you were the first person I thought of.
[16:14.660 --> 16:18.860]  This is a website that shows the genetic ties between cannabis strains.
[16:18.860 --> 16:24.100]  It holds a lot of information aside from genetic ties, such as breeder name and novelty score.
[16:24.100 --> 16:29.420]  The website is galaxy.phylosbioscience.com.
[16:29.420 --> 16:31.900]  They mentioned that this isn't anything exclusive.
[16:31.900 --> 16:35.140]  Anyone is able to get in touch with them and add genetics to the database.
[16:35.140 --> 16:39.820]  I have the contact information of a representative if this is something that you're interested
[16:39.820 --> 16:41.900]  in adding your genetics to.
[16:41.900 --> 16:44.100]  Thanks again for everything you do for our community.
[16:44.100 --> 16:49.960]  Irie has been one of my favorite terms since my trip to Jamaica in 2004, so I shall really
[16:49.960 --> 16:54.760]  use it for the first time with someone that can appreciate its meaning.
[16:54.760 --> 16:56.560]  Always Irie, Ben Osborne.
[16:56.560 --> 16:58.720]  Hey, Ben, thank you for the great email.
[16:58.720 --> 16:59.840]  I appreciate it.
[16:59.840 --> 17:05.480]  If anybody out there wants to send me an email, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[17:05.480 --> 17:06.560]  Send me an email.
[17:06.560 --> 17:09.320]  Maybe I will read your message on a future episode.
[17:09.320 --> 17:11.560]  Now let's talk about the Phylos Galaxy.
[17:11.560 --> 17:18.200]  Yes, I am very aware of the Phylos Galaxy because my grateful dog is actually part of
[17:18.440 --> 17:20.120]  their website.
[17:20.120 --> 17:24.760]  Colin Gordon from the Ethos Collective was kind enough to get my sample of grateful dog
[17:24.760 --> 17:26.680]  into their database.
[17:26.680 --> 17:32.080]  So Irie Genetics is actually included in the Phylos Bioscience Galaxy.
[17:32.080 --> 17:33.280]  I really like the website.
[17:33.280 --> 17:35.080]  I think it is great.
[17:35.080 --> 17:41.200]  One of my favorite parts about the website is an algorithm where you can put in a strain
[17:41.200 --> 17:47.760]  and it can show you strains that it has not been bred to and strains that it is genetically
[17:47.840 --> 17:52.560]  very far from that would be good breeding ideas.
[17:52.560 --> 17:57.360]  This website knows what genetics are making up each strain and it can tell you.
[17:57.360 --> 18:02.480]  So it recommended to me that I breed Girl Scout Cookies, the forum cut, to my grateful
[18:02.480 --> 18:07.280]  dog because they were so genetically far apart, they did not have any similar parents, that
[18:07.280 --> 18:09.080]  it would make a very unique cross.
[18:09.080 --> 18:14.240]  So it recommended that to me on the website, which I found to be very amazing because I
[18:14.240 --> 18:19.000]  had already made that cross and it was fucking tremendous and I call it Burning Spear.
[18:19.000 --> 18:20.800]  It had already been done.
[18:20.800 --> 18:26.000]  So I guess I need to send a Burning Spear clone to Phylos so that they can get it in
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.360]  their galaxy and show that it has been made.
[18:28.360 --> 18:31.400]  So that is one of the great things that the Phylos Galaxy does.
[18:31.400 --> 18:34.880]  I kind of think of it as an ancestry.com for cannabis.
[18:34.880 --> 18:38.800]  It is kind of like a family tree for the cannabis plant and I really like it.
[18:38.800 --> 18:40.600]  It is a really great website.
[18:40.600 --> 18:41.840]  It is really fun.
[18:41.840 --> 18:46.000]  Even if you guys are not breeders, if you are just interested in cannabis genetics and
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.880]  you want to nerd out a little bit on cannabis, I definitely recommend you go check out Phylos
[18:50.880 --> 18:52.600]  Bioscience.
[18:52.600 --> 18:54.120]  Just poke around.
[18:54.120 --> 18:59.000]  Once you get into the galaxy, you will start clicking and you will be there all day.
[18:59.000 --> 19:00.360]  So Ben, thanks for the great email.
[19:00.360 --> 19:04.720]  Thanks for giving me the opportunity to share Phylos Bioscience with my listeners.
[19:04.720 --> 19:06.600]  It is a great website.
[19:06.600 --> 19:11.440]  Cannabis genealogy is very interesting and once you start looking, you will start seeing
[19:11.440 --> 19:14.160]  all the strains you are familiar with and then you will see what they are crossed with
[19:14.160 --> 19:17.480]  and then you will want to know what those were crossed with and you will be there all
[19:17.480 --> 19:18.480]  day.
[19:18.480 --> 19:20.720]  So Ben, thanks again for the great email.
[19:20.720 --> 19:22.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to your emails.
[19:22.600 --> 19:26.920]  Once again, the email address is growfromyourheart.com.
[19:26.920 --> 19:28.560]  I would love to hear from you.
[19:28.560 --> 19:29.680]  Let's do a couple of quick shout outs.
[19:29.680 --> 19:34.720]  I owe a huge shout out to my friend Roger S. Also Juan R. and Kelvin Medina.
[19:34.720 --> 19:35.720]  Huge shout out.
[19:35.720 --> 19:38.200]  Thank you guys for the love and support.
[19:38.200 --> 19:41.000]  If I don't start wrapping it up soon, this will not be a quickie.
[19:41.000 --> 19:42.360]  So let's get this show wrapped up.
[19:42.360 --> 19:44.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, make sure you support me on social media.
[19:44.920 --> 19:45.920]  Find me on Facebook.
