[01:18.290 --> 01:22.850]  I'm smoking today I've been taking dabs of angels breath live batter from green
[01:22.850 --> 01:27.290]  dot labs this is a blend of halo and purple starburst on the package the
[01:27.290 --> 01:31.690]  flavor is described as gas floral and Apple I think I completely agree with
[01:31.690 --> 01:35.650]  that when I crack open the jar and greeted with that gassy aroma when I
[01:35.650 --> 01:39.090]  take a dab that is when the sweetness of the floral kicks in then after I
[01:39.090 --> 01:43.690]  exhale that is when a sour apple flavor just lingers on my tongue and I
[01:43.690 --> 01:48.090]  completely enjoy it one thing I should mention is that this concentrate kicked
[01:48.090 --> 01:53.850]  my ass I took a couple of fat dabs and I'm sitting here in mellow mode I'm
[01:53.850 --> 01:57.890]  super chilled out this has got me nice and relaxed on the back of the package

[03:22.090 --> 03:25.770]  much time let's not let me get too rambling and too off track let's jump
[03:25.770 --> 03:30.290]  right into the first email for today's episode this one comes from our friend
[03:30.290 --> 03:33.970]  they signed it one love from zombie this one comes from our friend zombie
[03:33.970 --> 03:38.930]  this is a great question it goes like this hey bro I had a quick question
[03:38.930 --> 03:43.250]  about splitting a grow space I have a room that is approximately seven feet
[03:43.250 --> 03:48.290]  wide by seven feet deep and ten ish feet tall all right I've got a good visual of
[03:48.290 --> 03:53.050]  that in my head I currently have a 5x5 grow tent in the room and the wasted
[03:53.050 --> 03:58.450]  space is driving me nuts yeah you've got a big room there you're wasting at least
[03:58.450 --> 04:02.130]  two feet by two feet each direction there's a lot of wasted space you could
[04:02.130 --> 04:06.130]  be doing a lot more productivity a lot more production in there a lot more
[04:06.130 --> 04:09.730]  plants is what I'm trying to say that would drive me nuts as well let's keep
[04:09.730 --> 04:13.050]  going the message says after much brainstorming I think the best solution
[04:13.050 --> 04:16.890]  is going to be building a wall between the flower space at three and a half by
[04:16.890 --> 04:23.570]  seven feet and a veg mother space at three by seven feet um okay I think
[04:23.570 --> 04:27.210]  there's an extra foot somewhere there but that maps out I think feel free to
[04:27.210 --> 04:32.570]  add your thoughts and input on that um my thought so far is that that doesn't
[04:32.570 --> 04:35.610]  math up there's a half a foot something somewhere missing but you're close
[04:35.610 --> 04:40.770]  enough then it's gonna go on to say my question however is about accessing the
[04:40.770 --> 04:44.930]  flowering space there's only one door to the room and I'm thinking it should open
[04:44.930 --> 04:50.930]  into the veg space since so there is no risk of a light leak from my main area
[04:50.930 --> 04:54.130]  causing trouble I get what you're asking and yes that does make great sense I will
[04:54.130 --> 04:58.770]  elaborate our friend has a big room he wants to divide the room into two spaces
[04:58.770 --> 05:02.610]  he's thinking about building a wall almost right down the center maybe leave
[05:02.610 --> 05:05.890]  one side maybe leave that flower space a little bit bigger the veg and mom side a
[05:05.890 --> 05:09.610]  little smaller but build a wall right down the middle now we've got two rooms
[05:09.610 --> 05:13.170]  he's wondering if he should access the room through that veg space yes
[05:13.170 --> 05:17.970]  absolutely the veg space we can interrupt that light cycle the veg will
[05:17.970 --> 05:21.930]  be on more often than the flowering cycle you're gonna run an 18-6 cycle
[05:21.930 --> 05:26.210]  perhaps a 24-hour on cycle in there let's walk into the grow through the
[05:26.210 --> 05:29.490]  veg space I'm gonna keep going because there is more to this it says so my
[05:29.490 --> 05:33.730]  issue is that I have a standard door in the room I have to keep so much space
[05:33.730 --> 05:37.650]  clear to physically open the door I'm wondering if you've seen anything in
[05:37.650 --> 05:41.530]  your experience consulting low-key grows there would be a good substitute for a
[05:41.530 --> 05:46.090]  standard door that I could maintain usable space in the veg and mother area
[05:46.090 --> 05:50.450]  so I had a couple of great suggestions and ideas for my friend zombie here I
[05:50.450 --> 05:55.450]  said that my first recommendation would be to build a just frame out a door a
[05:55.450 --> 05:59.050]  wall in the room make it just a crappy frame but won't take a lot of work just
[05:59.050 --> 06:03.370]  do some two by fours build a frame frame out a wall staple some poly to that wall
[06:03.370 --> 06:07.370]  now you've got a brand new wall if you don't have a lot of tools if you can't
[06:07.370 --> 06:10.650]  build a frame you can staple it to the ceiling you can staple it to the walls
[06:10.650 --> 06:13.970]  and let it hang put a two by four down on the floor and wrap it around the two
[06:13.970 --> 06:17.410]  by four that'll give it some structure at the bottom give it some support some
[06:17.410 --> 06:20.570]  stability you've got it stapled to the walls to the ceiling you've got it held
[06:20.570 --> 06:24.530]  to the floor that should keep it in place depending on how big this piece of
[06:24.530 --> 06:28.570]  panda film is or poly or whatever you're going to use I'd recommend I think poly
[06:28.570 --> 06:31.530]  and panda film are just the same thing just different words for the same shit I
[06:31.530 --> 06:35.290]  get some thick panda film staple it up to the ceiling staple it to the walls
[06:35.290 --> 06:39.890]  before you staple it fold it to make a little fold over you're doubling up the
[06:39.890 --> 06:43.370]  thickness of material then put a piece of duct tape over it then put the
[06:43.370 --> 06:46.610]  staples through the duct tape now you've got three pieces of material you are
[06:46.610 --> 06:50.090]  duct taping through the ceiling or to the ceiling so when that weight of that
[06:50.090 --> 06:54.810]  poly starts pulling down it doesn't tear the poly right away it'll give you duct
[06:54.810 --> 06:58.250]  tape and two pieces of poly worth of stretching before it starts to tear so
[06:58.250 --> 07:04.570]  make a division make a wall make a poly wall then at most grow stores you will
[07:04.570 --> 07:09.330]  find one of my favorite inventions it is a zipper it comes rolled up it's a long
[07:09.330 --> 07:13.050]  rolled up zipper you take that zipper and you think about where you want your
[07:13.210 --> 07:16.850]  door to be you unroll the zipper and it's got a sticker on the back of it you
[07:16.850 --> 07:20.130]  take it off just like you're putting on a big bumper sticker and you start from
[07:20.130 --> 07:22.810]  the floor and you go up or you could start at the top and go down but it's
[07:22.810 --> 07:26.730]  easier to start at the floor and go up in my opinion put that zipper right at
[07:26.730 --> 07:31.410]  the floor and unroll it and work your way up now you unzip the zipper and take
[07:31.410 --> 07:35.170]  a blade and cut right between those two pieces and now when you're ready to
[07:35.170 --> 07:38.930]  close it your zipper slides up and down and you've got a zippered door so we've
[07:38.930 --> 07:43.050]  made a poly wall we built a just a minimal frame you don't need a lot of
[07:43.050 --> 07:47.250]  framing just enough to keep the panda film supported build the wall then buy
[07:47.250 --> 07:50.930]  the zipper Hydrofarm or other companies make this zipper it just sticks right on
[07:50.930 --> 07:55.130]  I can't explain it any better than that it's a zipper they come zipped up it's
[07:55.130 --> 07:59.090]  got sticky on it you stick it on just like a sticker you unzip it and then you
[07:59.090 --> 08:03.130]  cut right up the middle where you zip and now you've made a separation and you
[08:03.130 --> 08:06.130]  can zip that closed I hope that makes sense I'm explaining it the best I can
[08:06.290 --> 08:09.770]  it looks good in my mind can't you see in my mind to see what I'm trying to
[08:09.770 --> 08:12.890]  show you all right jump in there for a minute get a free visual then jump out
[08:12.890 --> 08:16.450]  because there's shit you do not want to see let's keep moving we've built a
[08:16.450 --> 08:20.050]  poly wall we put a little bit of a zipper on there now you can enter that
[08:20.050 --> 08:23.250]  flowering room through the veg space of course you want to go into the flowering
[08:23.250 --> 08:26.890]  room make that the back part I don't go in there when the veg is on and the
[08:26.890 --> 08:30.690]  flowering room is off make sure the flowering room is on time that right but
[08:30.690 --> 08:34.370]  you should never have to enter the veg through the flower that's one thing you
[08:34.370 --> 08:38.490]  should always follow now let's address this door question you did ask how can I
[08:38.490 --> 08:42.370]  make some space for the door that is a very good question here's a very good
[08:42.370 --> 08:47.370]  suggestion I learned this from a I don't remember where I learned this here's a
[08:47.370 --> 08:50.890]  really good suggestion I may edit that I may not here's a suggestion for your
[08:50.890 --> 08:55.650]  door space one thing I have seen is most of the time doors swing open one thing
[08:55.650 --> 08:59.490]  I've seen people do is make a sliding door if the door just slides over if it
[08:59.490 --> 09:02.850]  just moves to the side and doesn't swing you don't get that whole swinging space
[09:02.850 --> 09:06.930]  wasted however much square footage that is of the door the door is probably two
[09:06.930 --> 09:11.130]  three feet long you got to have that big swinging space that's a lot of space
[09:11.130 --> 09:15.290]  wasted you could probably put two three maybe four seven gallon pots in the
[09:15.290 --> 09:19.130]  space that it takes to swing a door so I understand that that is valuable real
[09:19.130 --> 09:23.610]  estate make a sliding door the door doesn't have to swing if you can put a
[09:23.610 --> 09:27.250]  sliding door there if you could take the door off and just pop it off and on in
[09:27.250 --> 09:30.370]  and out every day that would be cool I understand this could be your home I
[09:30.370 --> 09:34.370]  don't know where you're doing this but a sliding door would save you a lot of
[09:34.370 --> 09:37.170]  space I'm sure the house doesn't have a sliding door that room probably doesn't
[09:37.170 --> 09:40.890]  have a sliding door now but in a lot of places where the homes are smaller they
[09:40.890 --> 09:45.810]  don't have a lot of space you will see that a sliding door is more effective
[09:45.810 --> 09:49.690]  more efficient more economical might be the word I'm looking for but anyway
[09:49.690 --> 09:54.850]  sliding door would help you out so I would say instead of dividing it by 50
[09:54.850 --> 10:03.130]  50 I would say probably do 60 40 maybe 35 7 what is the math there 65 35
[10:03.130 --> 10:06.530]  something like that yeah I know I'm doing math on the fly we'll call it
[10:06.530 --> 10:10.850]  engineer math divide a little bit differently then build that poly wall
[10:10.850 --> 10:14.690]  stick the zipper on there and then build yourself a sliding door let me make sure
[10:14.690 --> 10:19.610]  I answered all of the questions in here it looks like I covered you yep and then
[10:19.610 --> 10:23.250]  it says one love from zombie a zombie big love big respect thank you for the
[10:23.250 --> 10:26.490]  great message I want to hear how this worked out for you I want to know if
[10:26.490 --> 10:29.810]  you were able to build that wall because I did reply to zombie with a detailed
[10:29.810 --> 10:34.050]  email gave him some great info I want to know how that went for you please let me
[10:34.050 --> 10:37.210]  know all right I'm gonna keep moving so I don't get too rambling get too off
[10:37.210 --> 10:43.690]  topic here our next message comes from um oh it says my name is Jeff this
[10:43.690 --> 10:47.210]  message comes from another listener named Jeff what's up Jeff good to meet
[10:47.210 --> 10:52.090]  you and it says hey Ross to Jeff I apologize in the delay for thanking you
[10:52.090 --> 10:56.330]  for the pack of sun kiss never a delay in a thanks I get it the world is busy
[10:56.330 --> 10:59.650]  you said thank you you are very welcome I'm glad I was able to help you out with
[10:59.650 --> 11:04.250]  a pack of sun kiss seeds says they are perfect for me so thank you I and I
[11:04.250 --> 11:07.250]  remember getting this person a pack of sun kiss I understand the situation
[11:07.250 --> 11:10.570]  that's in the past we won't talk too much about that but you're very welcome
[11:10.570 --> 11:14.290]  for the pack of seeds I hope they will work well for you I now it says I've got
[11:14.290 --> 11:19.290]  a question for the show first I see no difference in seed banks that they sell
[11:19.290 --> 11:24.810]  CBD genetics and the flowers are loaded with trichomes what exactly is that made
[11:24.810 --> 11:30.410]  out of if it's almost no THC okay so I think the question you're saying is that
[11:30.410 --> 11:36.210]  you see seeds advertised on seed banks that are supposed to be high in CBD but
[11:36.210 --> 11:41.450]  they are covered in trichomes those trichomes just don't contain THC that
[11:41.450 --> 11:45.890]  plant is not known to produce THC that's not one of the traits of that plant so
[11:45.890 --> 11:50.010]  that is CBD within that plant that's what they're advertising I haven't
[11:50.010 --> 11:55.090]  grown that seed I can't testify what it's going to do but we're saying what
[11:55.090 --> 12:00.170]  is exactly is that made out of if it's almost no THC inside of those trichomes
[12:00.170 --> 12:05.130]  it is CBD that's all it is in there no THC their lab testing it is not showing
[12:05.130 --> 12:10.650]  the presence of THC so it goes on to say and they are different density or shape
[12:10.650 --> 12:16.050]  or anything really I think you're asking if CBD buds are any different
[12:16.050 --> 12:21.930]  than THC buds it is basically the same plant hemp and cannabis are basically
[12:21.930 --> 12:26.010]  the same plant in Colorado the main distinction between hemp and cannabis is
[12:26.010 --> 12:32.490]  a lab test that tells you if that plant has 0.3% THC or higher if it's got more
[12:32.490 --> 12:37.130]  than that it is now a cannabis plant it is not a hemp plant that may be 0.3 or
[12:37.130 --> 12:41.490]  0.03 somebody will correct me I didn't look before I started the show I have a
[12:41.490 --> 12:45.370]  bad habit of forgetting that number it's not something I need to pay attention to
[12:45.370 --> 12:50.130]  a lot but that is basically the distinction between hemp and cannabis is
[12:50.130 --> 12:55.450]  THC or CBD and a lab test it is the same plant it's the same thing it's just
[12:55.450 --> 12:59.730]  different traits does one put does one express THC or does one express CBD
[12:59.730 --> 13:03.370]  sometimes you get both and there are also other cannabinoids that we're
[13:03.370 --> 13:07.370]  learning about and discovering they're just not as prevalent and popular at
[13:07.370 --> 13:12.210]  this time you're gonna hear about CBV if you haven't already that'll be the next
[13:12.210 --> 13:16.770]  one that I predict will be really popular and CBG as well so it goes on it
[13:16.770 --> 13:21.690]  says I see a lot of websites taking use the same pictures for multiple strains
[13:21.690 --> 13:27.370]  and breeders I'm not sure what you mean by that the same website website uses
[13:27.370 --> 13:31.730]  the same strain multiple pictures strains and breeders if the one breeders
[13:31.730 --> 13:34.890]  on multiple websites you should use the same pic but I think you might be saying
[13:34.890 --> 13:38.330]  that you see the same picture pop up on multiple websites that's kind of bullshit
[13:38.330 --> 13:42.890]  that shouldn't be happening I'm not sure exactly what you mean there I can't
[13:42.890 --> 13:47.770]  speak too much on that without a clear idea of what you mean it says um I see a
[13:47.770 --> 13:51.170]  lot of websites taking use the same pictures and this is I was the man at
[13:51.170 --> 13:55.570]  playing memory as a kid I've even seen it in a few grow books so yeah I think
[13:55.570 --> 13:59.210]  there weren't as many photographers and as many people taking cannabis
[13:59.210 --> 14:02.890]  photography and doing it and so people were able to be kind of sneaky for a
[14:02.890 --> 14:07.490]  little while now the industry has gotten more transparent a while back everybody
[14:07.490 --> 14:10.850]  was just working in the shadows nobody knew who the breeders were nobody knew
[14:10.850 --> 14:14.450]  what the growers look like nobody knew who the photographers were so it was
[14:14.450 --> 14:18.010]  easier to kind of do people and not be completely honest and completely
[14:18.010 --> 14:22.170]  transparent so hopefully those times are past hopefully you're gonna start seeing
[14:22.170 --> 14:27.810]  actual real legit photos of the plants I know some breeders will put pictures of
[14:27.810 --> 14:31.050]  a mom plant so they can get photos out early and start selling the seeds I
[14:31.050 --> 14:34.410]  don't like to do that kind of stuff I don't think that's right I can't speak
[14:34.410 --> 14:38.050]  for what you saw but hopefully it doesn't happen anymore hopefully the
[14:38.050 --> 14:41.730]  industry has changed with all the transparency with legalization hopefully
[14:41.730 --> 14:45.770]  that shit goes away that says you've also seen it in grow books I'm sure I'm
[14:45.770 --> 14:49.490]  sure you've seen that sort of stuff it's gonna happen but hopefully it doesn't
[14:49.490 --> 14:52.490]  happen anymore we were getting more integrity in the industry is the word
[14:52.490 --> 14:56.330]  I've been fishing for then there's more to this it says second question is what
[14:56.330 --> 15:01.170]  you what brought you to be a Rastafarian I know very little about it I was raised
[15:01.170 --> 15:05.610]  Baptist and I hit a certain age and I couldn't pretend anymore to believe it
[15:05.610 --> 15:10.330]  so now I have no faith that's okay that says I was curious if you were brought
[15:10.330 --> 15:13.770]  up with your beliefs or found them later in life all right let me jump in here
[15:13.770 --> 15:20.030]  before I go too far what brought me to Rastafari um just like most people I was
[15:20.030 --> 15:22.690]  at a point in life where I was looking for something I didn't know I was
[15:22.690 --> 15:25.530]  looking for something but there was a gap in my life I didn't know what it was
[15:25.770 --> 15:30.210]  I met a couple of people who were Rasta and they taught me a lot of great things
[15:30.210 --> 15:33.810]  I was really drawn to one guy shout out Ross Chris you always mean a lot to me
[15:33.810 --> 15:38.010]  bro also big shout out to Ross Bradley those two guys taught me a lot they
[15:38.010 --> 15:41.090]  influenced and inspired me quite a bit they kind of looked after me they
[15:41.090 --> 15:44.490]  wouldn't let me get too out of line if my line of thinking was too outlandish
[15:44.490 --> 15:49.210]  they'd say bro that's not right and they'd kind of reel me in Ross Chris was
[15:49.210 --> 15:55.170]  seriously still is a heavy practicing Rastafarian Rasta Brad is he's got Rasta
[15:55.170 --> 15:58.490]  in his heart he doesn't follow Rasta so much now I had to kind of adjust to a
[15:58.490 --> 16:02.090]  different lifestyle but those guys taught me a lot I think being around
[16:02.090 --> 16:06.730]  them being exposed to Rasta all the right things just the stars lined up
[16:06.730 --> 16:11.370]  there's another Rasta saying it says he who feels it knows it and I know it so
[16:11.370 --> 16:16.090]  uh and no I wasn't raised around Rastafari I our family celebrated
[16:16.090 --> 16:19.650]  Christmas and Easter but I don't think we went to church more than five times
[16:19.650 --> 16:24.210]  when I was a kid so they believed in Christianity but they weren't Christians
[16:24.210 --> 16:27.650]  if that's like they actively were Walmart Christians they were American
[16:27.650 --> 16:31.970]  Christians they were holiday Christians that might be the way to put it they
[16:31.970 --> 16:37.010]  tried to be celebratory and whatnot but no our family wasn't really faith or
[16:37.010 --> 16:42.130]  religious based that was all on my own I kind of discovered that as an as a young
[16:42.130 --> 16:46.090]  adult and kind of just on my own because of some friends and just being around my
[16:46.090 --> 16:49.210]  friends and having a gap and when I started I knew that my life was going
[16:49.210 --> 16:52.770]  well and I knew that when I acknowledged the good things in my life I got more
[16:52.970 --> 16:56.610]  good things and when I started thinking jaw for those things and listening to
[16:56.610 --> 17:01.090]  the guidance of Rastafari those good things started coming in abundance and I
[17:01.090 --> 17:04.530]  still still follow that every day give thanks for what I'm given every day and
[17:04.530 --> 17:09.410]  the good gifts keep coming so I must be doing something right people don't want
[17:09.410 --> 17:12.250]  to hear too much about religious talk on a podcast they don't come here for that
[17:12.250 --> 17:15.130]  they come here for growing knowledge so thank you for the quick opportunity to
[17:15.130 --> 17:19.210]  talk about Rastafari for a moment a lot of people have asked me I've kind of
[17:19.210 --> 17:22.010]  avoided the question on the podcast that's for me that's not for you and a
[17:22.010 --> 17:26.450]  lot of people don't care so I became Rastafari because Ross Chris and Ross
[17:26.450 --> 17:30.090]  Brad were really inspirational because I knew there were a lot of good things
[17:30.090 --> 17:34.530]  going on in my life and a lot of it was pointing to Rastafari and I don't know
[17:34.530 --> 17:37.730]  it's been there ever since and it's never going away so that's where Rasta
[17:37.730 --> 17:40.890]  came from I'm gonna keep going it says I believe your fans are not a bunch of
[17:40.890 --> 17:44.730]  judgmental pricks and would love to get a little deeper into what made Rasta
[17:44.730 --> 17:49.290]  Jeff I hope that was a enough and not too much I'm sure some people got bored
[17:49.290 --> 17:53.570]  but Rastafari I thank you for hanging out it says I sure would too you can use
[17:53.570 --> 17:58.090]  my name it is Jeff hey Jeff thank you for the great message thank you for the
[17:58.090 --> 18:02.130]  cannabis culture and cultivation question I wish I had more answers for
[18:02.130 --> 18:06.810]  you about your CBD question I don't know why you were seeing the same photo for
[18:06.810 --> 18:11.450]  different strains that is just bad ethics and no integrity and hopefully
[18:11.450 --> 18:17.090]  that shit stops and Rastafari I think I explained how Rasta landed on me where
[18:17.210 --> 18:21.050]  are we in this show we're about 19 minutes in let's knock out one more
[18:21.050 --> 18:26.170]  message this one comes from justice grows make sure you follow justice
[18:26.170 --> 18:31.770]  underscore grows on Instagram justice's question actually Casey's question goes
[18:31.770 --> 18:36.650]  just like this it says hey Jeff I learned about your podcast via the
[18:36.650 --> 18:41.010]  grow cast and I've really been enjoying your grow advice and other content big
[18:41.010 --> 18:44.450]  shout out to our buddy Jordan River for having me on the grow cast thank you for
[18:44.450 --> 18:48.170]  the opportunity I need to return the favor and get you on the show here
[18:48.170 --> 18:52.970]  really soon let's talk about it it said you said feel free to email with
[18:52.970 --> 18:57.250]  questions so here it goes that's right I told you email with questions if anybody
[18:57.250 --> 19:00.610]  else out there has a cannabis culture or a cultivation question I would love to
[19:00.610 --> 19:04.490]  hear from you my email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com this
[19:04.490 --> 19:09.290]  question goes a lot like this I purchased regular seeds for the first
[19:09.290 --> 19:13.330]  time and I'm trying to figure out how and when to call the mails I'm growing
[19:13.330 --> 19:17.850]  in a single 4x4 tent which I use for both veg and flour I prefer the scrog
[19:17.850 --> 19:20.890]  method for plant training I see where we're gonna run into problems here
[19:20.890 --> 19:25.490]  however I typically begin scrogging during the mid veg stage and I'm
[19:25.490 --> 19:29.930]  assuming I won't be able to identify the sex until very late in veg or early
[19:29.930 --> 19:34.330]  flower I obviously don't want to scrog all of my plants and then try to
[19:34.330 --> 19:38.770]  untangle and remove a bunch of mails after they've grown into the netting any
[19:38.770 --> 19:42.250]  advice you can provide on how to best resolve this issue would be greatly
[19:42.370 --> 19:47.730]  appreciated thanks for the great work you do from Casey also known as justice
[19:47.730 --> 19:51.530]  grows on Instagram this is a great question this will get me talking for
[19:51.530 --> 19:56.090]  quite a few minutes we need to realize that the first run with the batch of
[19:56.090 --> 20:01.290]  seeds is not the production run you were thinking about growing big-ass plants
[20:01.290 --> 20:05.370]  scrogging them out training them spending a bunch of time on them and you
[20:05.370 --> 20:07.970]  don't even know what you've got you don't know if you've got males you don't
[20:07.970 --> 20:10.330]  know if you've got hermaphrodites you don't know if you've got bullshit
[20:10.330 --> 20:14.370]  phenotypes you don't know what's in there so we need to readjust our
[20:14.370 --> 20:18.930]  approach we need to do a pheno hunt and a finder run before we do a big
[20:18.930 --> 20:23.170]  production run you do have a couple of options if you don't want to waste a lot
[20:23.170 --> 20:27.010]  of time if you just want to find the males and call the males and get them
[20:27.010 --> 20:32.530]  out of there a real easy way to do it is to put the plants under 1212 lighting
[20:32.530 --> 20:37.090]  reduce the lights to 1212 give them 12 hours of darkness 12 hours of daytime in
[20:37.450 --> 20:42.050]  about 10 to 15 days you will see sex those plants will show you if they're
[20:42.050 --> 20:46.530]  boys or girls as soon as you have verified the sex of the plants put the
[20:46.530 --> 20:52.690]  timer back on 18 6 if these plants only get about 14 days into flower it will
[20:52.690 --> 20:56.730]  not take much to revert them back to veg then you can put them under your scrog
[20:56.730 --> 21:00.450]  screen spread them out the way you need to you're not gonna waste a lot of space
[21:00.450 --> 21:05.210]  that is a very quick and easy way to determine sex you can just throw the
[21:05.210 --> 21:09.850]  plants right under 1212 and they will show you if they're boys or girls then
[21:09.850 --> 21:13.690]  put them right back into veg take those boys out of there spread those girls out
[21:13.690 --> 21:18.210]  get them in the scrog net just the way you need to another option is to cut a
[21:18.210 --> 21:21.770]  clone I know you've only got the one room if you had two rooms this is what I
[21:21.770 --> 21:26.250]  would do I would cut a clone from each of those plants I would label the plants
[21:26.250 --> 21:30.170]  first plant one plant two plant three if you want to name them fucking Carol
[21:30.170 --> 21:34.130]  Karen and Eileen you can do that but label them then take a clone make sure
[21:34.130 --> 21:38.090]  that the clone is labeled appropriately Karen Carol and Eileen one two and three
[21:38.090 --> 21:43.370]  however you want to do it then put those clones under 1212 lighting the clones
[21:43.370 --> 21:47.850]  will root and they will show you sex within like I said earlier 10 to 15 days
[21:47.850 --> 21:51.490]  those clones will start to grow balls or they'll grow pistols and you can tell if
[21:51.490 --> 21:55.690]  you've got males or females then you can throw the clones away go throw the big
[21:55.690 --> 22:00.450]  plants away spread out those females but since you have only got the one space I
[22:00.650 --> 22:05.690]  think your best bet is to put the plants under 1212 lighting let them show you if
[22:05.690 --> 22:11.610]  they're male or female then return them back to 18 and 6 or 24 hours of lighting
[22:11.610 --> 22:14.890]  whichever you prefer whichever you're doing the 24 hours of lighting will
[22:14.890 --> 22:18.930]  revege them more quickly but I think the plants will grow more happily with the
[22:18.930 --> 22:23.770]  18 6 everybody likes a nap I'd probably kick ass with 24 hour days I've got a
[22:23.770 --> 22:28.730]  lot of energy I last a long time but I will need a nap eventually so I think 18
[22:28.810 --> 22:32.410]  6 may be the way to go so let me read back over the question make sure I didn't
[22:32.410 --> 22:36.970]  skip anything yes we are all at the same point here I would say put your plants
[22:36.970 --> 22:42.090]  in 1212 for just a few days as soon as you see sex put that timer back on 18 6
[22:42.090 --> 22:46.330]  put that scrog net up everything will go just as planned but you've got to keep
[22:46.330 --> 22:50.690]  in mind that sometimes that first run isn't meant to be a production run I
[22:50.690 --> 22:54.330]  would rather you grow them small don't even scrog them out just put them in
[22:54.330 --> 22:57.530]  there turn them and burn them and see what you've got now I understand that
[22:57.530 --> 23:01.410]  you don't have clones so even if you do have amazing keepers you can't run it
[23:01.410 --> 23:05.290]  again but in most ideal situations we would have a clone that we could run
[23:05.290 --> 23:08.330]  over and over again what are you gonna do bro you're gonna run these seeds one
[23:08.330 --> 23:12.890]  time and let them go what if you get the most amazing fucking keeper plant out of
[23:12.890 --> 23:16.210]  this and you don't have a clone we're both going to be heartbroken that's when
[23:16.210 --> 23:20.330]  you're gonna have to learn how to revege oh man all right you're gonna want it
[23:20.330 --> 23:23.050]  more tense that's what I'm thinking you're gonna want more tense really
[23:23.050 --> 23:28.130]  really soon so just as grows my advice for you is to put those plants under 12
[23:28.130 --> 23:32.250]  12 lighting until they begin to show you sex as soon as you see sex pull the boys
[23:32.250 --> 23:37.490]  out put the girls all back in that 18 6 lighting throw up the scrog net grow them
[23:37.490 --> 23:40.850]  into the scrog net as soon as the net is filled flip them into flower put up
[23:40.850 --> 23:44.530]  another net I'm sure you know what to do from there all right I want to thank you
[23:44.530 --> 23:47.650]  for the great message I feel like we have covered enough ground on this
