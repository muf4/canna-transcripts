[00:05.950 --> 00:26.450]  All right, welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:26.450 --> 00:29.010]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:29.010 --> 00:34.370]  This is episode 736 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:34.370 --> 00:37.710]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on a couple of listener emails.
[00:37.710 --> 00:41.430]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do some shout outs to those great folks who
[00:41.430 --> 00:44.730]  continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:44.730 --> 00:48.530]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to Elder's
[00:48.530 --> 00:49.530]  Garden.
[00:49.530 --> 00:53.530]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Stone Trout Bum in Growing, Tennessee.
[00:53.530 --> 00:56.450]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to Jay Dutch.
[00:56.450 --> 00:58.810]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Effa Plant Count.
[00:58.810 --> 01:02.030]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Justus Smokin and Godfather Kush.
[01:02.030 --> 01:03.890]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Noah N.
[01:03.890 --> 01:07.790]  I want to send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to ShoeTrader101.
[01:07.790 --> 01:11.130]  Let's send a thank you shout out to one of my favorite photographers, my buddy Anvil
[01:11.130 --> 01:12.130]  Gardens.
[01:12.130 --> 01:14.450]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Uncle Adam, the Uber driver.
[01:15.170 --> 01:18.330]  And let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[01:18.330 --> 01:20.070]  Indica Chris.
[01:20.070 --> 01:24.850]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:24.850 --> 01:28.390]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:28.390 --> 01:34.490]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:34.490 --> 01:37.810]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen and you know I do include
[01:37.810 --> 01:43.130]  that link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all
[01:43.130 --> 01:44.130]  of my friends.
[01:44.130 --> 01:47.290]  All right, I don't want to ramble too long here at the start of the show.
[01:47.290 --> 01:50.890]  I have a nice stack of listener emails here in front of me.
[01:50.890 --> 01:52.150]  Let's jump right into it.
[01:52.150 --> 01:56.350]  This first message did come from the Grow Help tab on the iRegenetics website.
[01:56.350 --> 02:01.450]  If you visit my website iRegenetics.com, there is a tab that says Grow Help.
[02:01.450 --> 02:02.850]  Simply click on that Grow Help tab.
[02:02.850 --> 02:07.290]  That will give you the opportunity to tell me about your grow and ask a few grow questions.
[02:07.290 --> 02:11.010]  I want to know the relative humidity, the temperature of your grow.
[02:11.010 --> 02:13.130]  I want to know if you're growing indoors and outdoors.
[02:13.130 --> 02:14.610]  I want to know what kind of plants you're growing.
[02:14.610 --> 02:17.690]  Once you tell me that, I give you the opportunity to ask a question.
[02:17.690 --> 02:21.030]  Then I will do my best to use that info to answer your question.
[02:21.030 --> 02:25.850]  This one did come from our friend Mike and it goes a lot like this.
[02:25.850 --> 02:30.010]  It says, Rasta Jeff, thanks for your response on the show about growing out mother plants.
[02:30.010 --> 02:34.690]  Yes, if you listened to the previous episodes, I did talk about growing mother plants.
[02:34.690 --> 02:37.530]  We had a listener send an email and their mother plants were dying.
[02:37.530 --> 02:40.130]  They weren't performing well when they would put them into flower.
[02:40.250 --> 02:41.490]  I gave some advice.
[02:41.490 --> 02:43.510]  This is a follow up on that email.
[02:43.510 --> 02:46.130]  It says, what you said did make sense.
[02:46.130 --> 02:49.530]  I didn't think they were root bound because I trimmed the root ball and transplanted them
[02:49.530 --> 02:52.450]  from two to three gallon containers before flipping.
[02:52.450 --> 02:55.410]  That may eliminate one opportunity why they were getting sad.
[02:55.410 --> 02:59.890]  It says, the real question is I've grown out four different cultivars and only one of them
[02:59.890 --> 03:02.250]  just straight dies every time.
[03:02.250 --> 03:03.890]  I'm not sure why that's happening.
[03:03.890 --> 03:04.890]  I'm not sure.
[03:04.890 --> 03:09.250]  There are so many anomalies, so many variables here that I'm not exactly sure what's happening.
[03:09.370 --> 03:12.890]  He does go on to say, because of low yields, I don't think I will waste time growing out
[03:12.890 --> 03:14.690]  the mothers anymore.
[03:14.690 --> 03:18.650]  That is a good idea unless you are planning and prepping from the beginning to grow out
[03:18.650 --> 03:19.650]  those mothers.
[03:19.650 --> 03:24.490]  It may be best just to retire them, toss them, use them as clone donors, then set them to
[03:24.490 --> 03:27.290]  the side, trash them, put them in the compost bin.
[03:27.290 --> 03:28.730]  You don't have to use everything.
[03:28.730 --> 03:32.250]  That is something that I enjoy and I admire.
[03:32.250 --> 03:36.170]  I respect and appreciate the idea that people want to use everything that comes from their
[03:36.170 --> 03:37.170]  garden.
[03:37.290 --> 03:41.010]  I appreciate that, but it's not always necessary.
[03:41.010 --> 03:44.690]  Sometimes you're going to spend more time, energy, money, resources on trying to make
[03:44.690 --> 03:48.530]  something out of your waste than you could have just thrown it away and actually not
[03:48.530 --> 03:49.570]  spent that money.
[03:49.570 --> 03:51.490]  You're not going to get much out of it.
[03:51.490 --> 03:53.570]  Sometimes if you don't have anything to do, if you're just looking for something to do
[03:53.570 --> 03:58.050]  on Saturday, you want to figure out how to turn all this wasted leaf into a juice, that
[03:58.050 --> 03:59.050]  may be something to do.
[03:59.050 --> 04:00.970]  But most of the time it is not worth it.
[04:00.970 --> 04:03.130]  Sometimes we got to bite the bullet and throw things away.
[04:03.130 --> 04:04.930]  You don't have to use everything.
[04:04.930 --> 04:08.930]  I appreciate it and I respect it, but sometimes it's not worth your time, energy, effort.
[04:08.930 --> 04:13.050]  You end up spending more energy, more time, buying more equipment, and then what you get
[04:13.050 --> 04:14.170]  isn't worth the output.
[04:14.170 --> 04:18.450]  You could have just gone to the dispensary possibly and bought that for a few bucks sometimes.
[04:18.450 --> 04:20.050]  Once again, you don't have to use everything.
[04:20.050 --> 04:23.450]  I do admire that you're trying to use those mother plants, but it may be time to put them
[04:23.450 --> 04:27.890]  in the compost bin and realize they have done what they needed to do for you.
[04:27.890 --> 04:29.530]  Thank you for the follow-up, bro.
[04:29.530 --> 04:33.130]  It is crazy that you're up-potting them and they are still not acting right.
[04:33.850 --> 04:35.290]  The up-pot is shocking them.
[04:35.290 --> 04:38.130]  There are so many variables that I just don't know what to tell you.
[04:38.130 --> 04:39.130]  Send me more info.
[04:39.130 --> 04:43.370]  Send me more details or it looks like you may have just given up on the idea altogether.
[04:43.370 --> 04:44.370]  Let's move forward.
[04:44.370 --> 04:45.890]  That's all we can do from here.
[04:45.890 --> 04:50.170]  This one says, Rasta Jeff, I have a quick question if I may.
[04:50.170 --> 04:53.650]  You guys, I'm going to read this one because we'll just read it and then we'll talk about
[04:53.650 --> 04:54.650]  it.
[04:54.650 --> 04:59.290]  It says, what would happen if I pollinized, and it does say pollinized, the word is pollinated.
[04:59.290 --> 05:04.170]  What would happen if I pollinized a male plant with another male's pollen?
[05:04.170 --> 05:09.690]  Would it be F1s with trait from both males, just like a male and female breeding project?
[05:09.690 --> 05:12.290]  I'm not even going to, then it says, cheers and kiss your mama.
[05:12.290 --> 05:14.050]  Then it says, if it's worth it, you can mention my name.
[05:14.050 --> 05:17.250]  I'm not going to mention your name, but thank you for the great message.
[05:17.250 --> 05:20.310]  I do want to explain this.
[05:20.310 --> 05:21.810]  This is a good question.
[05:21.810 --> 05:26.610]  Although this is a very, honestly, I'm not sure if I'm being trolled to be quite honest
[05:26.610 --> 05:28.950]  with you, but I'm going to answer this like a serious question.
[05:29.610 --> 05:30.610]  You may be trolling me.
[05:30.610 --> 05:32.270]  This may be a real question.
[05:32.270 --> 05:34.110]  Male plants cannot receive pollen.
[05:34.110 --> 05:36.230]  Male plants only give pollen.
[05:36.230 --> 05:38.710]  Female plants receive the pollen.
[05:38.710 --> 05:42.790]  You could pollinize a male with another male all you want, and all you're going to get
[05:42.790 --> 05:46.130]  is a male plant with more pollen dusted on it.
[05:46.130 --> 05:49.230]  Nothing is going to happen except a pollinated mess.
[05:49.230 --> 05:50.230]  You're going to have a bunch of pollen.
[05:50.230 --> 05:51.230]  You're going to sneeze.
[05:51.230 --> 05:52.990]  You're going to need to clean up.
[05:52.990 --> 05:57.270]  Nothing will happen if you put male pollen from a male plant onto another male plant.
[05:57.310 --> 05:59.150]  Male plants cannot receive pollen.
[05:59.150 --> 06:00.150]  They don't have pistils.
[06:00.150 --> 06:01.150]  They don't have ovules.
[06:01.150 --> 06:03.550]  They don't have all the parts needed to make seeds.
[06:03.550 --> 06:08.350]  That is like two dudes rubbing wieners, two piles of semen, two piles of sperm.
[06:08.350 --> 06:09.350]  Doesn't make anything.
[06:09.350 --> 06:10.350]  You need an egg.
[06:10.350 --> 06:11.670]  You need a sperm to make that happen.
[06:11.670 --> 06:14.590]  Male, female, basic biology, basic breeding.
[06:14.590 --> 06:16.550]  That is how plants work as well.
[06:16.550 --> 06:17.550]  There are variables.
[06:17.550 --> 06:22.190]  We can do weird things with plants, but with two male plants, we're just touching peepees
[06:22.190 --> 06:23.270]  and this isn't going to work.
[06:23.270 --> 06:24.590]  You're not going to do anything.
[06:24.590 --> 06:26.590]  This is a sword fight is all this is my friend.
[06:26.910 --> 06:30.510]  It says, the reason for my question is I have two male plants from different strains and
[06:30.510 --> 06:35.710]  both have unique traits and as a mad scientist, I like new weird projects.
[06:35.710 --> 06:38.430]  I would pick one of those males and use it and throw the other one away.
[06:38.430 --> 06:39.510]  That would be my advice.
[06:39.510 --> 06:40.630]  Pick your favorite.
[06:40.630 --> 06:41.630]  Use it.
[06:41.630 --> 06:43.510]  Toss the other one or use them separately.
[06:43.510 --> 06:46.750]  You do have to pollinate female plants, so maybe get a female plant.
[06:46.750 --> 06:50.710]  Do one cycle of pollen from male A. Do another run.
[06:50.710 --> 06:51.950]  It's got to be a totally separate run.
[06:51.950 --> 06:56.110]  You got to finish the plants, cut it down, dry it, cure it, then do a different plant.
[06:56.630 --> 07:00.630]  Pollinate that with the same male and see what that male is offering to your mix.
[07:00.630 --> 07:04.310]  The bottom line here is this is basic biology.
[07:04.310 --> 07:07.110]  I'm really not sure if I'm being trolled and if not, I apologize.
[07:07.110 --> 07:08.590]  I should be respectful to everybody.
[07:08.590 --> 07:10.510]  This could be a real question.
[07:10.510 --> 07:12.310]  Males do not receive pollen.
[07:12.310 --> 07:13.630]  Males give pollen.
[07:13.630 --> 07:14.910]  Females receive the pollen.
[07:14.910 --> 07:18.250]  The things you guys call hairs, those are pistols.
[07:18.250 --> 07:22.990]  Those are what actually receive the pollen and that pollen will slide down that little
[07:22.990 --> 07:26.050]  hair into more parts of the plant and make a seed.
[07:26.050 --> 07:29.830]  Without that part, the seeding cannot happen.
[07:29.830 --> 07:35.910]  My friend, I hope I answered your question and I hope I can encourage you to read some
[07:35.910 --> 07:42.030]  basic grow books and basic biology with all due respect because there's some basic schooling
[07:42.030 --> 07:43.390]  that got skipped there, my dude.
[07:43.390 --> 07:44.390]  All right.
[07:44.390 --> 07:45.390]  Thank you for the great message.
[07:45.390 --> 07:46.710]  I'm going to keep going.
[07:46.710 --> 07:47.710]  Let's see.
[07:47.710 --> 07:50.210]  This next one says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[07:50.210 --> 07:54.370]  This one came from our friend, Spaceman Spuff, very unique name.
[07:54.370 --> 07:56.770]  It says, I just realized, okay, there's more.
[07:56.770 --> 07:59.690]  We're going to cut out some of this because this is a two-part message.
[07:59.690 --> 08:04.210]  It says, I forgot to mention that the 18 to six light cycle for the last seven to 10 days
[08:04.210 --> 08:07.330]  of flower does seem to work for me as far as bulking up plants.
[08:07.330 --> 08:08.490]  That is a great bit of feedback.
[08:08.490 --> 08:13.530]  I have talked about in a lot of previous episodes about putting our plants, our flowering plants
[08:13.530 --> 08:18.210]  under 18 hours of lighting at the end of flower, 18 on and six off.
[08:18.210 --> 08:21.370]  A lot of people think I'm absolutely freaking crazy for doing it.
[08:21.370 --> 08:25.490]  The people that have tried it have given me great praise, great feedback, and great thanks
[08:25.490 --> 08:29.110]  for giving them the information because they are all completely satisfied with the results
[08:29.110 --> 08:30.610]  of this new technique.
[08:30.610 --> 08:35.330]  So the last seven to 10, maybe 10 to 14 days of a flowering cycle, I will return my lights
[08:35.330 --> 08:39.270]  to an 18 six cycle, 18 hours on six hours off.
[08:39.270 --> 08:41.450]  That gives the plants more photons, more light energy.
[08:41.450 --> 08:43.110]  They do grow more quickly.
[08:43.110 --> 08:44.810]  They get beefy, they get bulky.
[08:44.810 --> 08:46.050]  They do ripen up quite quickly.
[08:46.050 --> 08:48.970]  I think I get more weight and faster when I do this.
[08:48.970 --> 08:52.930]  So our friend says, I forgot to mention the 18 to six light cycle for the last 10 days
[08:52.930 --> 08:56.890]  of flower does seem to work as far as bulking up my plants.
[08:56.890 --> 09:01.770]  I'm not sure it did much for one of my plants, but there was a noticeable bulking up on my
[09:01.770 --> 09:03.890]  other plant, especially on the top main cola.
[09:03.890 --> 09:06.050]  Yes, that's where you're going to notice it the most.
[09:06.050 --> 09:07.050]  It goes on.
[09:07.050 --> 09:11.810]  It says, I just want to know if going any longer than 10 days at 18 six will cause any
[09:11.810 --> 09:13.970]  problems or cause revege.
[09:13.970 --> 09:17.610]  So will this cause any problems with re vegging?
[09:17.610 --> 09:20.370]  So we've got like a three part question here, which is super great.
[09:20.370 --> 09:21.530]  He also included some pics.
[09:21.530 --> 09:22.730]  Dude, your plants look awesome.
[09:22.730 --> 09:27.330]  I think I replied and asked what strain that was because that top cola looked fucking beefy.
[09:27.330 --> 09:28.330]  Good work, dude.
[09:28.330 --> 09:31.170]  Even if that's not one of my crosses, you did a great job with that plant.
[09:31.170 --> 09:32.490]  It looks excellent.
[09:32.490 --> 09:33.490]  So let's talk about this.
[09:33.490 --> 09:36.810]  Our friend is running the 18 six light cycle.
[09:36.810 --> 09:42.770]  He is curious if he wants to know if going longer than 10 days at 18 six will cause any
[09:42.770 --> 09:45.050]  problems or possible reveging.
[09:45.050 --> 09:49.290]  The second or maybe third part of the question is, will it mess up a revege if they do intend
[09:49.290 --> 09:56.330]  to revege going longer than 10 days, maybe 14, maybe 15, maybe 16 days shouldn't be a
[09:56.330 --> 09:57.330]  problem.
[09:57.330 --> 10:01.910]  You will start to see signs of revege before there are any problems.
[10:01.910 --> 10:04.450]  It will look like the buds are just getting little nubs at the tips.
[10:04.450 --> 10:08.010]  It'll look like little leaves are starting to come out at the very first sign of that.
[10:08.010 --> 10:09.170]  I recommend to harvest.
[10:09.170 --> 10:14.850]  That will take probably a minimum of 14, maybe 16, 17 days before you will start seeing
[10:14.850 --> 10:15.850]  that.
[10:15.850 --> 10:20.530]  By then, by now your plants should be done unless you started your 18 six light cycle
[10:20.530 --> 10:26.650]  way too early, which is why sometimes I recommend to run the plants one time on a normal light
[10:26.650 --> 10:28.130]  cycle before we do this.
[10:28.130 --> 10:29.890]  Don't do this with a brand new plant.
[10:29.890 --> 10:31.610]  Like I don't know, I've never dated this girl.
[10:31.610 --> 10:33.110]  I don't know what she likes normally.
[10:33.110 --> 10:34.450]  Now I don't know how to make things perfect.
[10:34.450 --> 10:36.050]  I never learned how to make it right.
[10:36.050 --> 10:38.370]  So I wouldn't do this the first time on a run with the plant.
[10:38.370 --> 10:41.130]  I would wait to do this the second, maybe the third run.
[10:41.130 --> 10:43.890]  But if you've done it on the first time and you found that you're going to take a little
[10:43.890 --> 10:46.550]  bit longer to flower, just pay attention to those buds.
[10:46.550 --> 10:49.090]  They may start developing a little, it looks like a foxtail.
[10:49.090 --> 10:51.570]  It looks like the tip is starting to put out more leaves.
[10:51.570 --> 10:53.110]  That is your first sign of revege.
[10:53.110 --> 10:54.610]  You can chop immediately.
[10:54.610 --> 10:55.650]  You won't have any problems.
[10:55.650 --> 11:01.050]  The trichomes may not be where you want them to be, but you can harvest at this point.
[11:01.050 --> 11:03.670]  Reveging doesn't happen like instantly, like overnight.
[11:03.670 --> 11:07.890]  You see it start to pop up on a couple of buds, probably smaller buds toward the bottom.
[11:07.890 --> 11:11.230]  You'll see it start to happen and then you'll say, oh shit, they're going to revege.
[11:11.230 --> 11:12.730]  You can cut everything down at that time.
[11:12.730 --> 11:14.170]  It will not be a problem.
[11:14.170 --> 11:18.530]  The buds may not look completely perfect, but you'll see it before it is problematic
[11:18.530 --> 11:20.010]  and then just cut down.
[11:20.010 --> 11:23.450]  Now if the plants aren't ready by that point, they should be because they've been under
[11:23.450 --> 11:28.730]  18-6 for 10, 14, 16, 17, maybe 20 days at this point.
[11:28.730 --> 11:31.850]  And now they are definitely going to start finishing more quickly.
[11:31.850 --> 11:36.210]  So the first part of the question was, will 18-6 cause problems?
[11:36.210 --> 11:38.130]  I don't think so.
[11:38.130 --> 11:39.290]  Only if you go for too long.
[11:39.290 --> 11:41.530]  And then it says, will it cause ore reveging?
[11:41.530 --> 11:44.290]  That is the only problem I assume you may run into.
[11:44.290 --> 11:47.530]  And that is if you go for extremely too long.
[11:47.530 --> 11:51.450]  The third part of this question is, will it cause any problems with the revege cycle?
[11:51.450 --> 11:57.170]  No, this will actually encourage and increase the success of your reveging cycle.
[11:57.170 --> 11:58.170]  Think about it now.
[11:58.170 --> 12:03.170]  We are already starting the revege process 10-14 days before we harvest.
[12:03.170 --> 12:05.850]  The plant is already being told some weird shit's going on.
[12:06.490 --> 12:08.610]  So if our light cycle changed, we may need to make some adjustments.
[12:08.610 --> 12:10.370]  The hormones will start shifting.
[12:10.370 --> 12:13.730]  It'll start making differences within the plant.
[12:13.730 --> 12:17.850]  The plants will change and the plant will show you about 10 or 14 days later.
[12:17.850 --> 12:22.210]  Then what we don't cut down, if we leave that, that plant has already technically been in
[12:22.210 --> 12:25.050]  revege, the start of revege for two weeks.
[12:25.050 --> 12:30.650]  You will get your revege success much more quickly than most of your other revege attempts.
[12:30.650 --> 12:33.570]  So I think it will increase the luck of your revege.
[12:33.570 --> 12:35.530]  I think it will make your plants bulkier.
[12:35.530 --> 12:41.170]  And I do not think you will run into any problems unless of course you started this way too
[12:41.170 --> 12:42.170]  early.
[12:42.170 --> 12:46.190]  All right, my friend Spaceman Spuff, I want to thank you for the great question.
[12:46.190 --> 12:48.450]  If you've got any follow-ups, you do know how to reach me.
[12:48.450 --> 12:52.850]  Of course, the email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[12:52.850 --> 12:53.850]  Don't be shy.
[12:53.850 --> 12:54.850]  Send me those messages.
[12:54.850 --> 12:56.490]  All right, I do have another one here in front of me.
[12:56.490 --> 13:00.410]  All right, after shuffling through these papers, I did find the message I am looking for.
[13:00.410 --> 13:02.530]  This one comes from our friend Michael.
[13:02.530 --> 13:04.010]  We're not going to read Michael's full name.
[13:04.010 --> 13:05.170]  Big up to my buddy Michael.
[13:05.170 --> 13:06.770]  Thank you for the great question.
[13:06.770 --> 13:08.650]  It goes a lot like this.
[13:08.650 --> 13:12.810]  It says, I just wanted to start by saying I've been listening and supporting for a hot
[13:12.810 --> 13:13.810]  minute.
[13:13.810 --> 13:14.810]  My name is Michael.
[13:14.810 --> 13:17.810]  I'm just a flower grower in a illegal state.
[13:17.810 --> 13:21.530]  Got a lot of genetics I want to run and I have a bunch to run, but I don't have the
[13:21.530 --> 13:24.890]  time to run, clone, and sex all of them.
[13:24.890 --> 13:26.210]  What would you do?
[13:26.210 --> 13:28.450]  That is a great, good question right there.
[13:28.450 --> 13:30.290]  It says, I've built a hella grow, started.
[13:30.530 --> 13:33.130]  Okay, he talks a lot about his grow, which we don't need to talk too much about right
[13:33.130 --> 13:37.490]  now, but the question is, our friend has, let's see, what's the word here?
[13:37.490 --> 13:42.370]  I have a bunch to run and I don't have time to run them, clone them, and sex them all.
[13:42.370 --> 13:43.370]  What would you do?
[13:43.370 --> 13:49.290]  I definitely, as a seed breeder, maybe a seed hoarder, definitely a seed collector, I may
[13:49.290 --> 13:56.650]  understand this problem of having a lot of seeds and not having the time, space, energy,
[13:56.770 --> 14:02.010]  fucking resources, basically the space and honestly the legal capacity to run as many
[14:02.010 --> 14:03.210]  numbers as I would like to run.
[14:03.210 --> 14:08.050]  If it were up to me, I'd be running 500 small plants at a time that wouldn't take up very
[14:08.050 --> 14:09.890]  much room, but legally I cannot do that.
[14:09.890 --> 14:13.170]  I'm limited to 12 here in the state of Colorado.
[14:13.170 --> 14:14.530]  What would I do?
[14:14.530 --> 14:15.530]  That's a very good question.
[14:15.530 --> 14:20.210]  What would I do if I wanted to grow a bunch of stuff out, find the keepers, find the winners,
[14:20.210 --> 14:21.210]  and see what I've got?
[14:21.210 --> 14:22.490]  That's a really good question.
[14:22.490 --> 14:23.730]  It's kind of all about your goal.
[14:23.730 --> 14:25.850]  I say that quite often.
[14:26.050 --> 14:27.530]  Growing and growing is about your goal.
[14:27.530 --> 14:28.530]  What's your goal?
[14:28.530 --> 14:30.850]  Do you want to build a big stable of keepers?
[14:30.850 --> 14:34.210]  Do you want to find just a few mommies for yourself?
[14:34.210 --> 14:39.410]  Are you looking to fill a greenhouse or a commercial grow with a stable for a medical
[14:39.410 --> 14:42.290]  supply so that you can have a bunch of strains on a shelf?
[14:42.290 --> 14:43.770]  Are you looking to become a breeder?
[14:43.770 --> 14:45.110]  What are your goals?
[14:45.110 --> 14:46.110]  Are you growing for you?
[14:46.110 --> 14:47.110]  Are you growing for patients?
[14:47.110 --> 14:49.010]  Are you growing for the market?
[14:49.010 --> 14:50.010]  What are you growing for?
[14:50.010 --> 14:52.190]  That is going to be the first question here.
[14:52.190 --> 14:53.370]  How many moms do you need?
[14:53.370 --> 14:56.410]  How many different varietals do you actually need around?
[14:56.410 --> 14:58.450]  Why do you need so many?
[14:58.450 --> 15:01.730]  I just ask questions because that makes you think, and then you can answer your own question
[15:01.730 --> 15:06.930]  for yourself and maybe figure things out without me getting too involved.
[15:06.930 --> 15:07.970]  Always have a goal.
[15:07.970 --> 15:08.970]  What are you trying to do?
[15:08.970 --> 15:09.970]  What are you looking for?
[15:09.970 --> 15:11.130]  Are you trying to find keepers?
[15:11.130 --> 15:12.850]  Are you just trying to see what you've made?
[15:12.850 --> 15:17.250]  Again, I'm not sure what the ultimate goal here is, but what would I do?
[15:17.250 --> 15:18.410]  I would set a goal.
[15:18.410 --> 15:20.290]  I would know what I'm looking for.
[15:20.290 --> 15:22.330]  Then I would pop seeds.
[15:22.330 --> 15:26.410]  Depending on the numbers of plants which you are allowed to have, that would dictate how
[15:26.410 --> 15:27.610]  many seeds I pop.
[15:27.610 --> 15:32.650]  If it were unlimited, I would pop as many as I could possibly manage.
[15:32.650 --> 15:34.370]  I would do hundreds, 500.
[15:34.370 --> 15:37.250]  I would like to do 500 seeds if I possibly could.
[15:37.250 --> 15:40.530]  I don't know your environment, your situation, your setup.
[15:40.530 --> 15:41.530]  I don't know how brave you are.
[15:41.530 --> 15:42.810]  I don't know if you want to follow the law.
[15:42.810 --> 15:44.210]  I don't know if you want to break the law.
[15:44.210 --> 15:48.210]  I can't encourage or promote you to do anything like that, but if it were up to me, I would
[15:48.210 --> 15:53.010]  run a bunch of small, small plants.
[15:53.010 --> 15:54.290]  There are several ways to do it.
[15:54.290 --> 15:58.930]  I would run, let's say I've got a tray that fits.
[15:58.930 --> 16:03.330]  When I was working the commercial grows, these little trays I would buy would hold 24 plants
[16:03.330 --> 16:04.330]  perfectly.
[16:04.330 --> 16:07.770]  So four of those trays was basically 100 plants, 100 cups.
[16:07.770 --> 16:09.490]  I could put beer cups in there.
[16:09.490 --> 16:13.610]  So now I could grow 100 beer cups under one small light, and I can see a lot of stuff
[16:13.610 --> 16:14.610]  from a seed line.
[16:14.610 --> 16:19.010]  If you run 100 seeds from a line of seeds, you will definitely see a lot of expression
[16:19.010 --> 16:20.970]  in that batch of seeds.
[16:20.970 --> 16:22.570]  First of all, you're going to call about 50 of them.
[16:22.570 --> 16:24.330]  So there's two trays that are gone right away.
[16:24.330 --> 16:26.530]  Now we're down to 48 plants.
[16:26.530 --> 16:29.250]  Now I'm down to my females because we're going to eliminate the males.
[16:29.250 --> 16:33.410]  Now we're going to start seeing the dominant phenotypes, which phenotypes really express
[16:33.410 --> 16:34.410]  themselves.
[16:34.410 --> 16:36.170]  You'll see the keepers, the not keepers.
[16:36.170 --> 16:37.410]  You'll see the traits.
[16:37.410 --> 16:41.650]  You'll see if there are any sex traits or any intersex traits, any hermaphroditic traits,
[16:41.650 --> 16:47.050]  any weirdos, any mutants, any anomalies, any standouts, any, anything that you do notice,
[16:47.050 --> 16:50.610]  anything you do love, anything you do hate, you're going to notice that within a hundred
[16:50.610 --> 16:52.450]  seeds that will, you'll definitely notice that.
[16:52.450 --> 16:54.730]  So I would run a hundred of them.
[16:54.730 --> 16:58.130]  Then keep an eye, take notes, number them, label all of them.
[16:58.130 --> 17:00.690]  Then when you're done, don't harvest everything.
[17:00.690 --> 17:03.810]  Leave enough there to where you can re-veg your favorite one.
[17:03.810 --> 17:08.010]  Also if you're, if you've got that many seeds and you see something in a pack of a hundred,
[17:08.010 --> 17:11.610]  you're probably going to be able to find it again as the breeder, as the person that
[17:11.610 --> 17:15.330]  made that pack, you could probably identify that one again in the future and be able to
[17:15.330 --> 17:16.330]  find that keeper.
[17:16.330 --> 17:18.730]  If you found one in a hundred, it is there again.
[17:18.730 --> 17:19.850]  That's not going to be super rare.
[17:19.850 --> 17:20.850]  You can find that.
[17:20.850 --> 17:22.570]  So I would pop a bunch of seeds.
[17:22.570 --> 17:24.170]  I would hunt through those seeds.
[17:24.170 --> 17:25.690]  I would find the keeper.
[17:25.690 --> 17:27.370]  Then I would re-veg that keeper.
[17:27.370 --> 17:29.930]  Then I would pop another hundred seeds.
[17:29.930 --> 17:31.250]  Then I would do it all over again.
[17:31.250 --> 17:35.450]  I would keep doing this until I found the amount of plants which I needed to fill my
[17:35.450 --> 17:36.450]  stable.
[17:36.450 --> 17:38.170]  Here in Colorado, I'm allowed 12 plants.
[17:38.170 --> 17:41.970]  I guess I'd work on finding like four or five great mom plants and then start growing
[17:41.970 --> 17:42.970]  those out.
[17:42.970 --> 17:45.490]  Then every so often I'd run another pack of seeds.
[17:45.490 --> 17:49.290]  And then once you've decided your number of mother plants, we'll say five.
[17:49.290 --> 17:50.690]  We've got five good mom plants.
[17:50.690 --> 17:52.530]  Right now you run another pack of seeds.
[17:52.530 --> 17:56.450]  If one of those seeds is better than the five you've got, call the worst one of your five
[17:56.450 --> 17:58.690]  keepers and replace it with that new girl.
[17:58.690 --> 18:00.510]  Then you've got the five best all the time.
[18:00.510 --> 18:01.810]  So I would pop seeds.
[18:01.810 --> 18:02.810]  I would hunt them.
[18:02.810 --> 18:05.050]  I would repeat and I would build a catalog.
[18:05.090 --> 18:09.490]  I would do a bunch of small plants because that way you don't have to worry about cloning.
[18:09.490 --> 18:11.330]  Very small plants that you can re-veg.
[18:11.330 --> 18:13.450]  I talk a lot about re-vegging.
[18:13.450 --> 18:17.610]  It's very easy to do and it saves you all that time and space of cloning.
[18:17.610 --> 18:19.770]  Every time you clone, you basically double your plant count.
[18:19.770 --> 18:20.930]  You double your workload.
[18:20.930 --> 18:22.090]  I do understand.
[18:22.090 --> 18:26.890]  So if you've got an unlimited plant count, I would do a bunch of tester runs in cups.
[18:26.890 --> 18:27.890]  That's how I do my testers.
[18:27.890 --> 18:29.370]  Honestly, I do them in cups.
[18:29.370 --> 18:32.330]  I veg them until they're a few inches tall, depending on the strain, depending on the
[18:32.330 --> 18:33.770]  structure of the plant.
[18:33.770 --> 18:34.770]  Then I flip it.
[18:35.490 --> 18:37.810]  They flower for 70 days and we know what we've got.
[18:37.810 --> 18:41.570]  At the end of 70 days, I cut them down, leave a little bit on the bottom, re-veg them.
[18:41.570 --> 18:45.730]  If I want to run it again, I've got that plant for future use.
[18:45.730 --> 18:51.810]  Now one thing I want to talk about is it's really fun to run through a shit ton of seeds.
[18:51.810 --> 18:52.810]  Don't get me wrong.
[18:52.810 --> 18:56.010]  I love, I just said I love to run through 500 seeds.
[18:56.010 --> 18:57.010]  That's a good time.
[18:57.010 --> 18:58.010]  You get to take a lot of notes.
[18:58.010 --> 18:59.530]  You get to see a lot of expressions.
[18:59.530 --> 19:02.730]  You get to learn a lot of shit about the plants that you have made.
[19:03.170 --> 19:05.530]  That's also like going on 500 dates.
[19:05.530 --> 19:07.210]  How are you going to remember anything?
[19:07.210 --> 19:09.370]  How are you going to know if you're really interested in anything?
[19:09.370 --> 19:13.210]  Because you've got 499 others distracting you to think about.
[19:13.210 --> 19:14.210]  There's a lot of data.
[19:14.210 --> 19:15.450]  That's a lot of info.
[19:15.450 --> 19:21.570]  My advice may be, one of the options may be to pick your favorite batch of seeds.
[19:21.570 --> 19:23.250]  What's getting your attention the most?
[19:23.250 --> 19:26.530]  Somebody out of all of the seeds you've got is saying, grow me.
[19:26.530 --> 19:27.530]  You know which one it is.
[19:27.530 --> 19:29.130]  You don't even have to think about it.
[19:29.130 --> 19:31.410]  There's a pack that you've been going, I should grow that.
[19:31.410 --> 19:32.410]  Grab that pack.
[19:33.090 --> 19:36.570]  Grow all of the phenotypes out of there to the best of your ability.
[19:36.570 --> 19:38.290]  Grow as many as you can.
[19:38.290 --> 19:43.490]  Then narrow it down to about five of your favorite females out of that big population.
[19:43.490 --> 19:44.650]  Now you've got the best five.
[19:44.650 --> 19:45.970]  Grow those again.
[19:45.970 --> 19:49.290]  When you grow those again, narrow it down to your favorite two or three.
[19:49.290 --> 19:50.730]  Now it's going to get harder the next time.
[19:50.730 --> 19:53.490]  Now narrow it down to your favorite one or two.
[19:53.490 --> 19:57.810]  How about instead of running 500 plants and trying to find a bunch of keepers,
[19:57.810 --> 20:01.730]  why don't we run 50, 100 and find the one keeper?
[20:02.050 --> 20:03.530]  Really focus on some plants.
[20:03.530 --> 20:05.410]  Build a relationship with these plants.
[20:05.410 --> 20:09.810]  It's fun to grow a lot of shit, but how do you know that that plant that you're working with
[20:09.810 --> 20:12.930]  is reaching its potential and showing you what it could really do
[20:12.930 --> 20:15.530]  if you're messing with 500 total plants?
[20:15.530 --> 20:16.250]  It's like dating.
[20:16.250 --> 20:19.970]  If you got seven dates, you're not going to know which girl was into strawberry ice cream,
[20:19.970 --> 20:21.730]  which girl was into vanilla ice cream.
[20:21.730 --> 20:22.570]  You're going to have to guess.
[20:22.570 --> 20:24.330]  You're going to be like, oh shit, you got to take notes.
[20:24.330 --> 20:25.970]  You don't build any real relationship.
[20:25.970 --> 20:30.250]  If you focus on one plant, one person, you'll learn all the details, all the anomalies,
[20:30.290 --> 20:33.170]  all the ticks, all the things that makes that plant shine,
[20:33.170 --> 20:36.090]  all the things that make that plant angry, you'll learn that.
[20:36.090 --> 20:40.370]  Around week five, if I give it a nice boost of potassium, it really goes crazy.
[20:40.370 --> 20:43.570]  You'll learn that if I over give it too much cow mag around week seven,
[20:43.570 --> 20:44.810]  it'll go fucking crazy.
[20:44.810 --> 20:47.610]  You'll start to learn all these nuances of the plant
[20:47.610 --> 20:53.570]  if you develop a relationship with one cut and run it multiple times over and over again.
[20:53.570 --> 20:56.970]  I know that doesn't sound as exciting as running a bunch of seeds,
[20:57.010 --> 21:01.290]  but imagine what you can do once you get one plant really dialed in.
[21:01.290 --> 21:03.730]  The first time you grow it, it'll be good,
[21:03.730 --> 21:07.490]  but we're running 500 plants in the same environment, same conditions.
[21:07.490 --> 21:10.850]  They don't have a solid chance to show us what they can really do.
[21:10.850 --> 21:13.170]  We need to take a couple of plants and learn them.
[21:13.170 --> 21:16.210]  Like I said a moment ago, maybe it wants something special at week six.
[21:16.210 --> 21:18.690]  Maybe it doesn't want something at week six.
[21:18.690 --> 21:21.450]  Maybe if you make it colder at week seven, it'll do something.
[21:21.450 --> 21:24.450]  Maybe if you make it really hot at week nine, it does something different.
[21:24.450 --> 21:26.130]  We've got to learn these things about the plants.
[21:26.170 --> 21:29.610]  The only way we learn that is by growing them over and over again
[21:29.610 --> 21:34.290]  and seeing how they react to different environments and different stressors,
[21:34.290 --> 21:36.330]  different feedings, different things.
[21:36.330 --> 21:39.650]  I like to try little different things every time I grow
[21:39.650 --> 21:41.290]  because I've got a good grasp on growing.
[21:41.290 --> 21:42.850]  I know what my plants are going to do.
[21:42.850 --> 21:43.770]  What if?
[21:43.770 --> 21:45.810]  What if I get it real, real cold in here this season?
[21:45.810 --> 21:47.650]  What if I get it real, real hot in here this season?
[21:47.650 --> 21:49.730]  What if I forget to water the plants?
[21:49.730 --> 21:51.170]  Let's just see what happens.
[21:51.170 --> 21:54.330]  Experiments, that's where you learn the most.
[21:54.370 --> 21:57.090]  And then if you grow that plant several times throughout the year,
[21:57.090 --> 21:59.850]  like I just said, maybe it gets real hot, maybe it gets real cold.
[21:59.850 --> 22:01.210]  I'm in Colorado.
[22:01.210 --> 22:05.650]  This summer, it's going to hit like 112, 115 degrees.
[22:05.650 --> 22:08.730]  In the winter, it gets to negative 17 degrees.
[22:08.730 --> 22:12.170]  I do my best to keep my grow spaces dialed in and evened out,
[22:12.170 --> 22:14.330]  but I'm fucking not there all the time.
[22:14.330 --> 22:15.050]  Shit goes wrong.
[22:15.050 --> 22:17.530]  Sometimes it gets a little bit cold in the grow rooms.
[22:17.530 --> 22:19.890]  Sometimes it gets a little bit hotter in the grow rooms.
[22:19.890 --> 22:23.050]  I notice differences in the performance of different plants
[22:23.050 --> 22:25.170]  based on these anomalies in the grow room,
[22:25.170 --> 22:28.930]  which I fail to control because of my outside environmental factors.
[22:28.930 --> 22:31.130]  Sometimes, honestly, it's so cold outside,
[22:31.130 --> 22:33.450]  I can't warm the grow room to be 80 degrees.
[22:33.450 --> 22:35.130]  I can only get it to 70.
[22:35.130 --> 22:38.850]  Sometimes it's so hot outside, I can't cool the grow room down to 74.
[22:38.850 --> 22:41.170]  I can only get it to 80 because it's so hot.
[22:41.170 --> 22:45.130]  That's when I really do see different expressions from some of these plants.
[22:45.130 --> 22:48.290]  Also, different light cycles, different feed cycles,
[22:48.290 --> 22:51.330]  then different defoliation methods, maybe not defoliating,
[22:51.330 --> 22:53.810]  maybe do or maybe do not pop it and twist it.
[22:53.810 --> 22:56.210]  All these different things do make a difference to the plant.
[22:56.210 --> 22:59.090]  So I love the idea that you want to run through a bunch of shit
[22:59.090 --> 23:00.090]  and find all the keepers,
[23:00.090 --> 23:04.890]  but also maybe you're missing something by going so quickly through so many numbers
[23:04.890 --> 23:06.890]  and not spending time on that one plant.
[23:06.890 --> 23:08.970]  Maybe that one right there that you keep looking over
[23:08.970 --> 23:11.090]  because you got 499 others,
[23:11.090 --> 23:14.850]  maybe that one is the next fucking Golden Chem,
[23:14.850 --> 23:19.050]  Gorilla, Cookie, Biscuit, Biscotti,
[23:19.050 --> 23:20.850]  what's the Diesel, Kusch.
[23:20.850 --> 23:22.210]  I'm trying to name all the popular shit,
[23:22.210 --> 23:25.450]  but the Piff, whatever else is popular, Cake Stuff.
[23:25.450 --> 23:27.730]  Maybe it's a new popular one and you don't even know it
[23:27.730 --> 23:31.010]  because you haven't taken the time to dial it in and perfect it.
[23:31.010 --> 23:34.010]  So dial in each cultivar before you pass them on.
[23:34.010 --> 23:36.650]  Of course, if that strain sucks completely the first time you grow it,
[23:36.650 --> 23:39.650]  you could tell as an experienced grower, as a phenohunter,
[23:39.650 --> 23:41.450]  you could tell when something straight up sucks.
[23:41.450 --> 23:44.130]  But if you think it's a 7 on the first time you run it
[23:44.130 --> 23:46.730]  and you're looking for 9s and 10s, give it another run.
[23:46.730 --> 23:48.210]  Maybe you did something wrong.
[23:48.250 --> 23:50.890]  You can bring out the potential of that plant.
[23:50.890 --> 23:52.170]  So what would I do?
[23:52.170 --> 23:53.930]  I would run a whole fucking bunch of plants
[23:53.930 --> 23:55.850]  or I would slow my ass down
[23:55.850 --> 23:59.210]  and just run a few with the space and resources I've got.
[23:59.210 --> 24:02.290]  Keep yourself legal, keep yourself safe, keep yourself sane.
[24:02.290 --> 24:05.730]  Also, keep yourself a bunch of notes.
[24:05.730 --> 24:07.570]  All right, my friend, I think I rambled on
[24:07.570 --> 24:09.570]  for quite a while about that message.
[24:09.570 --> 24:12.570]  I think I covered all of the details.
[24:12.570 --> 24:14.570]  It also goes on, it says,
[24:14.570 --> 24:19.010]  um, uh, I wanna get to know you better through the servers.
[24:19.010 --> 24:20.170]  Thanks, bro.
[24:20.170 --> 24:21.130]  I do appreciate that.
[24:21.130 --> 24:23.410]  Guys, I should add a disclaimer right now.
[24:23.410 --> 24:25.690]  We did some changes to the Discord servers
[24:25.690 --> 24:29.330]  and if you cannot find the new updated Discord server,
[24:29.330 --> 24:31.530]  I will add a link to my website.
[24:31.530 --> 24:35.210]  There will be a link on my website, iRegenetics.com.
[24:35.210 --> 24:36.930]  There'll be a link to the new Discord server.
[24:36.930 --> 24:39.210]  That will get you to the new updated Discord.
[24:39.210 --> 24:40.130]  I do apologize.
[24:40.130 --> 24:42.250]  We had to make some changes, do some new things.
[24:42.250 --> 24:44.970]  The old server was having some tech issues.
[24:44.970 --> 24:46.970]  Those issues are now wiped away
[24:46.970 --> 24:48.770]  because there's a brand new server.
[24:48.770 --> 24:50.930]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps,
[24:50.930 --> 24:53.010]  hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[24:53.010 --> 24:54.730]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers,

[25:55.210 --> 25:56.890]  for all of the continued support.
[25:56.890 --> 25:57.850]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[25:57.850 --> 25:59.450]  boys, girls, I am rambly.
[25:59.450 --> 26:01.210]  It is time to wrap up this episode.
[26:01.210 --> 26:02.610]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days
[26:02.610 --> 26:03.970]  with fresh new content.
[26:03.970 --> 26:06.490]  I wanna give a big shout out to my buddy, Rosin Ryan.
