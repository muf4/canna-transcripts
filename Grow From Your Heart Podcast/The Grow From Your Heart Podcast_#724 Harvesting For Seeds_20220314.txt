[02:22.050 --> 02:23.690]  All right no more advertising.
[02:23.690 --> 02:25.610]  Let's get right to the point of this podcast.
[02:25.610 --> 02:28.370]  I've been doing a talk about feminized seeds.
[02:28.370 --> 02:31.590]  I taught you how to make your silver thiosulfate solution.
[02:31.590 --> 02:35.890]  We talked more in depth about storing the solution, more about application.
[02:35.890 --> 02:38.210]  I did two full episodes on it.
[02:38.210 --> 02:40.610]  Now we should have made some seeds by now.
[02:40.610 --> 02:43.010]  Let's talk a little bit about harvesting seeds.
[02:43.010 --> 02:46.250]  This episode is going to be about harvesting seeded cannabis plants.
[02:46.250 --> 02:50.530]  This doesn't really matter if the seeds are regular seeds, if they're fem seeds, if they're
[02:50.530 --> 02:53.170]  auto flowers, if they're even hemp seeds.
[02:53.170 --> 02:57.570]  This will work for just about any sort of cannabis seeds if they are ready, if they're
[02:57.570 --> 02:58.710]  mature, if they're ripe.
[02:58.710 --> 03:01.150]  This will be an effective method.
[03:01.150 --> 03:04.930]  So big up to everybody who asked me for advice on harvesting seeds.
[03:04.930 --> 03:09.730]  This is how I personally harvest my seeded cannabis plants.
[03:09.730 --> 03:12.170]  I'm going for maximum seed harvest.
[03:12.170 --> 03:14.810]  I want as many as I can get, as many healthy seeds.
[03:14.810 --> 03:17.850]  So this is how I do it for commercial.
[03:17.850 --> 03:21.330]  One thing I do is I start checking for the ripeness of the seed.
[03:21.330 --> 03:24.730]  We don't want to just chop down a plant if we don't know it's not ready.
[03:24.730 --> 03:27.810]  Most of the time we would get a magnifying glass and we would look at the trichomes.
[03:27.810 --> 03:28.810]  We can't do that here.
[03:28.810 --> 03:30.850]  We're not concerned about the trichomes.
[03:30.850 --> 03:33.210]  The trichomes honestly do not matter at this point.
[03:33.210 --> 03:35.210]  All I care about is the seeds.
[03:35.210 --> 03:36.570]  Are the seeds ready?
[03:36.570 --> 03:40.410]  So what I do is I start pulling seeds out of the plant.
[03:40.410 --> 03:44.290]  Usually around day 65 or 70, the plants will be ready.
[03:44.290 --> 03:49.690]  So about day 60, 65, I try not to get too impatient, but I do pay attention to each
[03:49.690 --> 03:50.690]  cultivar.
[03:50.690 --> 03:53.130]  I will just start pulling seeds out of the buds.
[03:53.130 --> 03:57.490]  I like to get the top of the plant, the middle of the plant and the bottom of the plant.
[03:57.490 --> 04:00.530]  Don't go for those obvious seeds that are sticking up right at the edge of the bud.
[04:00.530 --> 04:04.250]  Go for something kind of deeper into the bud that's not protruding out, showing you
[04:04.250 --> 04:05.290]  that it's almost ready.
[04:05.290 --> 04:07.850]  Get a seed that you actually need to investigate.
[04:07.850 --> 04:10.010]  Something that hasn't been getting all of the light.
[04:10.010 --> 04:12.030]  Something that's a little deeper into the plant.
[04:12.030 --> 04:13.370]  Something not prime, not ideal.
[04:13.370 --> 04:14.370]  That one will be ready.
[04:14.370 --> 04:16.370]  If you find the right seed, it's ready.
[04:16.370 --> 04:20.610]  Let's find a surprise seed, one in the middle, one in a million and see what that seed looks
[04:20.610 --> 04:21.610]  like.
[04:21.610 --> 04:23.250]  So I will pull the seed out of the nug.
[04:23.250 --> 04:25.050]  I'll just reach in there and you can feel it.
[04:25.050 --> 04:27.210]  If it's hard enough at this point, you can feel it.
[04:27.210 --> 04:28.530]  Just work its way out of the bud.
[04:28.530 --> 04:29.530]  Pull it out.
[04:29.530 --> 04:32.530]  Pull out the casing or the hole or the shell, whatever you want to call that part.
[04:32.530 --> 04:35.010]  Get that right off of your seed.
[04:35.010 --> 04:37.230]  Now we need to visually inspect our seed.
[04:37.230 --> 04:38.850]  What color is the seed?
[04:38.850 --> 04:39.850]  Is it pale?
[04:39.850 --> 04:44.970]  If it's still pale, if it's white and pale or grayish, it is not ready yet.
[04:44.970 --> 04:46.170]  There's two different kinds of gray.
[04:46.170 --> 04:49.410]  There's a gray where it's not ready and a gray when it's almost too done.
[04:49.410 --> 04:52.970]  So if it's light colored, still soft and squishy, obviously not done.
[04:52.970 --> 04:54.810]  Is it starting to get some color to it?
[04:54.810 --> 04:56.010]  Is it getting tiger striped?
[04:56.010 --> 04:57.010]  Is it getting green?
[04:57.010 --> 04:58.010]  Is it getting brown?
[04:58.010 --> 04:59.010]  Is it getting moldy?
[04:59.490 --> 05:02.570]  Let's pay attention to all of the things that could be happening to the seeds.
[05:02.570 --> 05:06.090]  We do have potential of getting powdery mildew, bud rot.
[05:06.090 --> 05:09.170]  All those things are still possible when we're breeding with forced seed.
[05:09.170 --> 05:13.130]  So let's pay attention, make sure we're not getting anything on the seeds and the plants.
[05:13.130 --> 05:16.530]  So let's pull the seeds out, see if they're ripe, see what they're looking like.
[05:16.530 --> 05:19.610]  When they start feeling hard, I give them what I call the pinch test.
[05:19.610 --> 05:24.090]  When they start feeling hard is when it is time to harvest, when most of the seeds within
[05:24.090 --> 05:25.610]  that plant feel hard.
[05:25.610 --> 05:26.770]  I'll pull a few out.
[05:26.770 --> 05:28.690]  I'll roll them on a hard wooden table.
[05:28.730 --> 05:29.730]  This table is fairly hard.
[05:29.730 --> 05:30.730]  You can hear me knock on it.
[05:30.730 --> 05:33.450]  That's a hard, sturdy, solid table.
[05:33.450 --> 05:36.170]  A table, a countertop, something that was no give.
[05:36.170 --> 05:39.230]  That's what I would take the seeds and I'd spread a bunch out on the table and press
[05:39.230 --> 05:42.630]  them with my pointer finger and just roll them around, crush them.
[05:42.630 --> 05:44.170]  If they crush, they're not ready.
[05:44.170 --> 05:46.370]  If they don't crush, they're probably ready.
[05:46.370 --> 05:48.930]  If they super don't crush, you may have gone too far.
[05:48.930 --> 05:51.610]  If you let these seeds go too long, they will get too hard.
[05:51.610 --> 05:56.370]  So I reach into the bud, pull out a few seeds, roll them around, crush them, see what they
[05:56.370 --> 05:57.370]  do.
[05:57.370 --> 06:02.330]  When they don't crush anymore, when the majority of the seeds don't crush, it is time to harvest.
[06:02.330 --> 06:08.910]  It will be hard to achieve a point where every seed in that plant is optimal.
[06:08.910 --> 06:14.010]  Just like trichomes, we want to go when the majority of the plant is done.
[06:14.010 --> 06:16.290]  So we want as many seeds as we can get.
[06:16.290 --> 06:17.850]  Some of the seeds will not be done.
[06:17.850 --> 06:21.930]  Some will be overripe, but the majority will be perfect if we take this plant down at the
[06:21.930 --> 06:23.130]  right time.
[06:23.130 --> 06:24.350]  So we find out the seeds are hard.
[06:24.350 --> 06:25.550]  We find out they're the right color.
[06:25.550 --> 06:26.550]  They got their tiger stripes.
[06:26.550 --> 06:27.870]  They're not crushing.
[06:27.870 --> 06:29.070]  It is time to cut them down.
[06:29.070 --> 06:34.030]  I usually chop down around day 70, 72 in an indoor flowering run.
[06:34.030 --> 06:36.390]  That's if pollen happened around the right time.
[06:36.390 --> 06:38.430]  I did a previous episode to tell you about that.
[06:38.430 --> 06:40.470]  So chop when they're ready.
[06:40.470 --> 06:41.470]  That's what it says here.
[06:41.470 --> 06:42.470]  Chop when ready.
[06:42.470 --> 06:45.030]  Before I chop, I do a heavy defoliation.
[06:45.030 --> 06:49.390]  I go in and I pull off as many leaves as I can possibly remove because this is going
[06:49.390 --> 06:51.670]  to help speed up the drying process.
[06:51.670 --> 06:55.430]  This is going to help drastically speed up the sorting process.
[06:56.310 --> 06:57.550]  You don't want to sort through a bunch of leaves.
[06:57.550 --> 07:01.590]  We're going to turn this all into a powdery dust eventually and get the seeds out.
[07:01.590 --> 07:04.610]  So pull off all the leaves that you can.
[07:04.610 --> 07:07.790]  Defoliate heavily before you cut the plants down.
[07:07.790 --> 07:10.190]  Then after they're naked, I will cut them down.
[07:10.190 --> 07:15.770]  I've got a couple of different ways to do this depending on space, where I am, the environment.
[07:15.770 --> 07:19.990]  Sometimes if I'm working with a bunch of plants of one strain and all of the seeds in there
[07:19.990 --> 07:24.190]  are going to be the same seeds, I will lay a tarp on the floor, maybe some panda film
[07:24.190 --> 07:25.510]  on the floor.
[07:25.510 --> 07:29.590]  One time I just used a big trash can lid and let that catch any seeds that may fall out.
[07:29.590 --> 07:31.710]  Then I just hang the plants from the ceiling.
[07:31.710 --> 07:35.350]  I use either fishing line or one time I was in a basement, I just used a bunch of little
[07:35.350 --> 07:39.150]  eye hooks and screwed them into the basement ceiling, into the rafters down there.
[07:39.150 --> 07:41.150]  But hang the plants up.
[07:41.150 --> 07:42.150]  That's the point here.
[07:42.150 --> 07:44.110]  Get the plants hanging so that they're going to dry.
[07:44.110 --> 07:47.550]  Don't let them hang too long because they will get dry and seeds will begin to fall
[07:47.550 --> 07:48.630]  out.
[07:48.630 --> 07:52.550]  If you've got plants, they will fit in rubber made tubs.
[07:52.550 --> 07:53.950]  I've got these rubber made tubs.
[07:54.710 --> 07:57.950]  They're approximately, I'm going to guess they're three feet long by two feet wide by
[07:57.950 --> 07:59.510]  18 inches tall.
[07:59.510 --> 08:00.510]  They've got a lid on them.
[08:00.510 --> 08:03.710]  I do not put the lid on them, but they do come with the lid.
[08:03.710 --> 08:07.150]  Sometimes I'll chop down the plant and just put the entire plant right inside of that
[08:07.150 --> 08:08.150]  tub.
[08:08.150 --> 08:09.390]  Just let it sit right in there.
[08:09.390 --> 08:12.350]  I'm not really concerned about drying and curing this product.
[08:12.350 --> 08:13.350]  This isn't going to be weed.
[08:13.350 --> 08:15.150]  I want seeds out of here.
[08:15.150 --> 08:18.790]  So I don't put it in a beautiful environment, a nice condition or anything.
[08:18.790 --> 08:20.630]  It goes wherever it can go.
[08:20.630 --> 08:24.670]  Sometimes it goes in the grow room in the corner so that it gets warm and dry.
[08:24.670 --> 08:27.270]  I just need these plants to dry up quickly.
[08:27.270 --> 08:28.270]  That's all I'm worried about.
[08:28.270 --> 08:29.990]  So I cut them down, hang them.
[08:29.990 --> 08:33.390]  If the seeds start popping out, then I'll drop them into that Tupperware container or
[08:33.390 --> 08:35.510]  that Rubbermaid or Sterlite bin.
[08:35.510 --> 08:36.750]  I've got them in there.
[08:36.750 --> 08:40.430]  You can do it a lot of different ways as long as your plants are isolated.
[08:40.430 --> 08:44.990]  If you've got more than one strain, if you've got more than one female that has been pollinated,
[08:44.990 --> 08:48.390]  keep them separate so you don't cross the seeds up and get those confused.
[08:48.430 --> 08:53.590]  I make very strong efforts to keep all of my seeds separate because my seeds go out
[08:53.590 --> 08:54.590]  for commercial use.
[08:54.590 --> 08:56.310]  I want people to get what they think they're getting.
[08:56.310 --> 08:59.070]  I want the packages to be labeled correctly.
[08:59.070 --> 09:00.910]  That takes effort from the beginning.
[09:00.910 --> 09:02.470]  So I've got my plants down.
[09:02.470 --> 09:03.470]  They get into their bins.
[09:03.470 --> 09:05.870]  They get dry, dry, dry.
[09:05.870 --> 09:09.870]  To speed up this drying process, I will take the buds off of the sticks.
[09:09.870 --> 09:11.670]  I put on some gloves.
[09:11.670 --> 09:12.670]  They're not super thick gloves.
[09:12.670 --> 09:14.150]  They're just thin leather gloves.
[09:14.150 --> 09:15.710]  Sometimes I can do it barehanded.
[09:15.710 --> 09:20.070]  If the buds are just moist enough, just dry enough, it'll work beautifully barehanded.
[09:20.070 --> 09:21.710]  But here's what we're going to do.
[09:21.710 --> 09:25.710]  Grab the stick and just put your hand around that stalk and just pull and knock the buds
[09:25.710 --> 09:30.670]  right off the stick into your five-gallon bucket, your Sterlite bin, your Rubbermaid
[09:30.670 --> 09:31.670]  tote.
[09:31.670 --> 09:32.910]  Just get those buds right off of there.
[09:32.910 --> 09:34.510]  We don't need that stick in there.
[09:34.510 --> 09:36.150]  We're not going to dry and cure anything.
[09:36.150 --> 09:37.910]  We're not making smokable flower.
[09:37.910 --> 09:40.950]  We are after nothing but seeds at this point.
[09:40.950 --> 09:44.990]  Now some of you out there may want to make concentrates or edibles or something with
[09:45.270 --> 09:47.910]  the material that comes from the seeds.
[09:47.910 --> 09:49.390]  I do not do that.
[09:49.390 --> 09:53.390]  I am focused on strictly seed production, seed movement.
[09:53.390 --> 09:55.190]  I don't care about all the stuff that comes out.
[09:55.190 --> 10:00.110]  All the material, the chaff is what I think we call it, the junk, the trash, that honestly
[10:00.110 --> 10:04.350]  goes in the compost pile or in the Bokashi bucket and it gets reused.
[10:04.350 --> 10:08.710]  It gets turned back into minerals for plant growth, for compost.
[10:08.710 --> 10:13.390]  Goes out in the yard, gets the plants outside, not the ganja plants, but the normal yard
[10:13.430 --> 10:15.430]  looks real good because of that stuff.
[10:15.430 --> 10:17.870]  So I honestly beat the shit out of it.
[10:17.870 --> 10:21.350]  It's so beat up by the time I'm done that there's any concentrates we've made with it
[10:21.350 --> 10:25.150]  come out green and funky and gross and I don't make edibles myself.
[10:25.150 --> 10:26.150]  So it's not worth my time.
[10:26.150 --> 10:27.150]  I throw it all away.
[10:27.150 --> 10:29.070]  So I pull the buds off the sticks.
[10:29.070 --> 10:33.350]  I got a five gallon bucket or a tote filled with just little tiny buds and they're getting
[10:33.350 --> 10:34.950]  drier by the day.
[10:34.950 --> 10:37.470]  My reasoning is I want to get these seeds dried.
[10:37.470 --> 10:40.950]  I want to get them out of these buds and I want to get them packaged and get them out
[10:40.950 --> 10:43.350]  to either testers or vendors.
[10:43.350 --> 10:44.550]  Quickly as soon as possible.
[10:44.550 --> 10:46.390]  There's no good in them sitting there.
[10:46.390 --> 10:50.310]  No product does you any good sitting in a garage, sitting on a shelf, sitting in a room.
[10:50.310 --> 10:51.690]  We got to get it somewhere.
[10:51.690 --> 10:53.790]  So I want to get this going as quickly as possible.
[10:53.790 --> 10:55.950]  So I get the sticks out of the buds.
[10:55.950 --> 10:58.110]  I get the buds as small as I can get them.
[10:58.110 --> 11:01.590]  Occasionally when I walk by, I'll just put my hands in there and just break up those
[11:01.590 --> 11:06.350]  buds even smaller because smaller buds, more surface area, they will dry more quickly.
[11:06.350 --> 11:10.230]  Give them a stir, mix up that stuff, get the air out of there, get the moisture out of
[11:10.230 --> 11:13.310]  there, speed them up, get them dry, dry, dry.
[11:13.470 --> 11:16.150]  Once they are completely dry, this is when the fun begins.
[11:16.150 --> 11:20.430]  I want it dry to where if it was weed, you'd be mad that it got that dry.
[11:20.430 --> 11:23.390]  But said this before, I'm not worried about the weed at all.
[11:23.390 --> 11:27.030]  I'm only worried about the beans which are inside of those flowers.
[11:27.030 --> 11:30.310]  So we're going to get it bone dusty dry.
[11:30.310 --> 11:32.550]  Now we've got a couple of options.
[11:32.550 --> 11:36.870]  Sometimes I'll use a five gallon bucket and I just put on gloves and it depends on how
[11:36.870 --> 11:38.470]  much material there is.
[11:38.470 --> 11:42.390]  I may just get in there with my fingers and my hands and just do this move and just rub
[11:42.470 --> 11:46.950]  the buds and just grind it all up and crush it up with my hands until it's a fine dust.
[11:46.950 --> 11:51.070]  I'm not going to go hard enough to crush or break or disrupt or rupture or destroy any
[11:51.070 --> 11:52.750]  of the seeds that are in there.
[11:52.750 --> 11:55.950]  But the herb is so dry that I can just rub it with my hands and it'll start crumbling
[11:55.950 --> 11:57.210]  up into dust.
[11:57.210 --> 12:00.710]  You can hear the seeds land back into the bucket.
[12:00.710 --> 12:03.230]  It sounds like it's raining into the bucket if you've done it right.
[12:03.230 --> 12:05.230]  You get a bunch of seeds out of there.
[12:05.230 --> 12:09.230]  Another method that I've seen people do and somebody is going to say this is crazy, but
[12:09.230 --> 12:11.190]  I learned it from a crazy person.
[12:11.190 --> 12:13.750]  Big respect to my buddy who showed me this.
[12:13.750 --> 12:19.310]  At the store, at the hardware store, they sell what is called a paint paddle for your drill.
[12:19.310 --> 12:23.470]  You can get a power drill and they put a thing on there that is meant to stir paint.
[12:23.470 --> 12:27.870]  It looks like a propeller for a boat or something similar to that and it's supposed to get down
[12:27.870 --> 12:30.070]  into the bottom of a bucket of paint and stir it.
[12:30.070 --> 12:32.190]  Then you move it up and down and stir your paint.
[12:32.190 --> 12:36.510]  I've seen somebody put that on a drill and stick it in the five gallon bucket of buds
[12:36.510 --> 12:38.070]  with seeds in it.
[12:38.070 --> 12:39.390]  Excuse me for the throat clearing, you guys.
[12:39.390 --> 12:42.630]  I took a couple of monster dabs and it's got my throat choked up.
[12:42.630 --> 12:45.990]  We take the paint stirrer, put it on a medium low setting.
[12:45.990 --> 12:49.590]  You don't want to get in there and full on destroy the seeds, but a medium low setting
[12:49.590 --> 12:51.790]  to where it's spinning and let it hit the buds.
[12:51.790 --> 12:55.430]  If the buds are dry enough, they basically just crumble under that drill, under that
[12:55.430 --> 12:57.790]  flour bit, under the stirrer bit.
[12:57.790 --> 12:59.270]  It just crushes them.
[12:59.270 --> 13:00.870]  Not bad enough to destroy the seeds.
[13:00.870 --> 13:02.150]  That's something we need to focus on.
[13:02.150 --> 13:05.390]  If you're going to put a drill bit in there, if you're going to use something mechanical,
[13:05.390 --> 13:06.750]  do not crush the seeds.
[13:06.750 --> 13:07.750]  Be gentle.
[13:08.190 --> 13:10.350]  Pay attention is the word I'm trying to say.
[13:10.350 --> 13:16.030]  The main objective is to get it super dry and then crumble it up into a dry, dusty mess.
[13:16.030 --> 13:18.790]  You've got a bunch of weed with a bunch of seeds in it.
[13:18.790 --> 13:21.030]  Now we've got a container with weed and seeds.
[13:21.030 --> 13:22.510]  Now we've got to separate that.
[13:22.510 --> 13:24.310]  Here is the funnest part of the game.
[13:24.310 --> 13:27.030]  In my opinion, this is almost the same as trimming.
[13:27.030 --> 13:30.710]  I don't have to trim because I just turned all my weed into seeds and dust.
[13:30.710 --> 13:32.070]  This is my version of trimming.
[13:32.070 --> 13:34.910]  Then packaging seeds is also my version of trimming.
[13:34.910 --> 13:37.390]  Can't complain about that, but this is the next step.
[13:37.430 --> 13:40.870]  We've got to remove all the beans from all of that weed.
[13:40.870 --> 13:43.430]  Luckily, gravity will work for us for a lot of this.
[13:43.430 --> 13:46.750]  If you've got the right kind of container, you can tip it to one side and most of your
[13:46.750 --> 13:50.150]  seeds will roll to the corner that you've tipped it to.
[13:50.150 --> 13:53.870]  If you've done it right, if you've used a container that is tall enough, wide enough,
[13:53.870 --> 13:57.750]  deep enough, and not, if it's the right shape, you may be able to reach in with your hand
[13:57.750 --> 14:01.710]  and pull out most of the material and leave all of the seeds at the bottom.
[14:01.710 --> 14:04.990]  Help yourself out and just start scooping it out the best you can.
[14:04.990 --> 14:07.190]  Then we've got a couple of options.
[14:07.190 --> 14:10.830]  The most affordable and effective way, of course, is that old school way.
[14:10.830 --> 14:12.710]  Just get an album cover or something.
[14:12.710 --> 14:15.110]  A lot of people have no idea what I'm even talking about.
[14:15.110 --> 14:18.990]  Get a magazine, something flat, and just tip it up on one edge and let the seeds run out
[14:18.990 --> 14:20.870]  and let that heavier material stay.
[14:20.870 --> 14:24.510]  If you tip something up and if you put the seeds on a tray or a magazine or something
[14:24.510 --> 14:27.610]  and you tip it, the seeds will roll down and the weed will stay there.
[14:27.610 --> 14:29.310]  You can do that a couple of times and clean it out.
[14:29.310 --> 14:30.310]  That's the old school way.
[14:30.310 --> 14:32.830]  If you've made a lot of seeds, that will drive you crazy.
[14:32.830 --> 14:34.830]  I possibly could never do that.
[14:34.830 --> 14:37.870]  I would never ever finish sorting seeds.
[14:37.870 --> 14:38.870]  There's another way to do it.
[14:38.870 --> 14:44.990]  You can get a flower sifter from your local grocery store or the mart down the street.
[14:44.990 --> 14:45.990]  It's a sifter.
[14:45.990 --> 14:50.390]  It looks like a net with a plastic ring around it and a handle, but it's a mesh net, a metal
[14:50.390 --> 14:51.390]  net.
[14:51.390 --> 14:54.910]  You throw the material and the seeds in there and gently rub it around over another bowl.
[14:54.910 --> 14:56.510]  The material will fall out of the bottom.
[14:56.510 --> 14:58.670]  The seeds will remain in the top.
[14:58.670 --> 15:00.470]  You've got your seeds that way.
[15:00.470 --> 15:03.150]  Wear some rubber gloves because your fingers are going to get all chafed and all funky
[15:03.150 --> 15:04.150]  from that.
[15:04.150 --> 15:05.150]  It takes a while.
[15:05.150 --> 15:06.350]  That's a frustrating process.
[15:06.350 --> 15:09.150]  If you don't have a lot of seeds, that will get her done.
[15:09.150 --> 15:12.430]  If you have a lot of seeds, this is when the job does get harder.
[15:12.430 --> 15:14.470]  I've seen a ... Shout out to Masonic Smoker.
[15:14.470 --> 15:16.370]  I haven't seen this method in a long time.
[15:16.370 --> 15:19.630]  He wasn't the first one that I saw do it, but I forgot all about it.
[15:19.630 --> 15:24.430]  Mace took a container that had herb and seeds in it and he just gingerly turned on the shop
[15:24.430 --> 15:28.950]  vac and just kind of feathered the top of the weed and the material and pulled out the
[15:28.950 --> 15:32.610]  weed and just kind of gingerly tipped it around and moved it to where none of the seeds were
[15:32.610 --> 15:35.610]  getting sucked up, but the weed was getting removed from the container.
[15:35.610 --> 15:39.330]  He got most of it out that way, then went back, just kind of hand clean it.
[15:39.330 --> 15:41.130]  That's a super easy way to do it.
[15:41.130 --> 15:44.790]  The other way to do it is a seed sorting machine.
[15:44.790 --> 15:48.510]  There are numerous seed sorting machines available on the internet.
[15:48.510 --> 15:50.130]  My favorite is the small device.
[15:50.130 --> 15:51.850]  It looks like a white shoe box.
[15:51.850 --> 15:53.730]  It's got two drawers on the front of it.
[15:53.730 --> 15:56.090]  It's got a spot you pour in the material.
[15:56.090 --> 15:57.650]  The fucking seeds come out on one side.
[15:57.650 --> 15:59.050]  The material comes out on the other.
[15:59.050 --> 16:00.650]  It's fucking magic inside there.
[16:00.650 --> 16:01.770]  I love that machine.
[16:01.770 --> 16:02.270]  It's great.
[16:02.270 --> 16:04.570]  There is another one that is much larger.
[16:04.570 --> 16:05.850]  It hooks up to a shop vac.
[16:05.850 --> 16:07.370]  It's a little bit cumbersome.
[16:07.370 --> 16:10.690]  If you're making a bunch of seeds, that one is effective for you.
[16:10.690 --> 16:12.770]  That's overkill for me and I make a lot of seeds.
[16:12.770 --> 16:16.490]  It just takes up a lot of space and you need the shop vac also.
[16:16.490 --> 16:19.290]  The little white square piece, it's a standalone unit.
[16:19.290 --> 16:21.890]  It's got a computer fan in there and it works beautifully.
[16:21.890 --> 16:27.370]  The best part about both of those seed separating devices is there are very simple blueprints
[16:27.370 --> 16:29.490]  and plans all over the internet.
[16:29.570 --> 16:33.490]  If you need a seed sorting machine, there are blueprints, plans, guides all over the
[16:33.490 --> 16:34.490]  internet.
[16:34.490 --> 16:38.690]  I think my friend Cascadian Grown for a while was making seed sorting machines.
[16:38.690 --> 16:39.850]  I do approve of those.
[16:39.850 --> 16:41.570]  Those are quality devices.
[16:41.570 --> 16:43.650]  Check out Cascadian Grown on the social media.
[16:43.650 --> 16:46.690]  If you're in the weed scene, the cannabis crew, you know how to find him.
[16:46.690 --> 16:49.050]  If you're new, follow my social media.
[16:49.050 --> 16:50.530]  Let me know you need to find Cascadian.
[16:50.530 --> 16:51.530]  We'll get you in touch.
[16:51.530 --> 16:54.210]  Honestly, don't know if he's still making them, but he's a good dude and I want to give
[16:54.210 --> 16:58.650]  him a plug if I've got an opportunity because he would give me a plug if he had the opportunity
[16:58.810 --> 16:59.810]  because that's what family does.
[16:59.810 --> 17:00.810]  All right.
[17:00.810 --> 17:01.810]  Where the hell are we?
[17:01.810 --> 17:03.330]  I got rambly.
[17:03.330 --> 17:09.010]  You can definitely make your own seed sorting machine, sorting seeds, counting seeds, sorting
[17:09.010 --> 17:10.010]  seeds.
[17:10.010 --> 17:12.570]  That's another thing that I would recommend is buy yourself a seed counter.
[17:12.570 --> 17:17.570]  I think they're about 350 to 450 bucks depending on the quality that you get and of course
[17:17.570 --> 17:19.850]  how quickly you get it shipped.
[17:19.850 --> 17:23.370]  Find one that'll ship it to you for free if you're spending that much money, but a seed
[17:23.370 --> 17:24.490]  counter is ideal.
[17:24.490 --> 17:27.370]  I love just putting the seeds in the seed counter and watching it turn.
[17:27.370 --> 17:28.370]  It doesn't spin.
[17:28.370 --> 17:29.370]  It looks like it spins.
[17:29.370 --> 17:30.370]  It's vibration.
[17:30.370 --> 17:33.170]  Love watching the seeds spin up the little thing and into the shoot and show me how many
[17:33.170 --> 17:34.370]  seeds I've got.
[17:34.370 --> 17:36.250]  So much better than guessing.
[17:36.250 --> 17:39.530]  Once you've done it a lot of times, you'll get a good guess, but it's so much better.
[17:39.530 --> 17:43.850]  Then I can do inventory like this, beep and they go brrrr and then it tells me how many
[17:43.850 --> 17:45.030]  seeds are there.
[17:45.030 --> 17:46.030]  So awesome.
[17:46.030 --> 17:52.390]  So get yourself a seed sorting machine or get yourself a sifter or an album cover or
[17:52.390 --> 17:53.690]  some way to get the seeds out.
[17:53.690 --> 17:55.810]  Have a strategy there.
[17:55.810 --> 18:00.050]  Maybe if you don't destroy that weed so badly by using the sorting machine and all the shit
[18:00.050 --> 18:03.610]  that I do to it, you may be able to make something out of that leftover weed.
[18:03.610 --> 18:04.650]  I never intend to.
[18:04.650 --> 18:06.050]  I never plan to.
[18:06.050 --> 18:10.650]  I just straight up pollinate everything, destroy the whole plant, get all the seeds out.
[18:10.650 --> 18:13.930]  Then since I have a seed company, I guess I just use the funding from the seed company
[18:13.930 --> 18:17.250]  to buy the concentrates and the edibles, which I would enjoy.
[18:17.250 --> 18:19.530]  That's my strategy there.
[18:19.530 --> 18:21.170]  So let it get real dry.
[18:21.170 --> 18:22.290]  Crumble it up.
[18:22.290 --> 18:24.650]  Once it's crumbled up, that's when you've got some decisions to make.
[18:24.650 --> 18:27.410]  Are you going to use the sifter or how are you going to crumble it?
[18:27.410 --> 18:28.410]  You're going to use a drill.
[18:28.410 --> 18:29.530]  You're going to use your gloves.
[18:29.530 --> 18:33.290]  I've seen people put it in a baggie and just stomp on the baggie a lot or mash the baggie
[18:33.290 --> 18:34.290]  with their hands.
[18:34.290 --> 18:36.690]  As long as you get that weed real dry, it will work.
[18:36.690 --> 18:38.770]  Then figure out how you're going to get the seeds out.
[18:38.770 --> 18:40.290]  Are you going to use the sifter, the machine?
[18:40.290 --> 18:41.530]  You're going to use gravity.
[18:41.530 --> 18:43.250]  You're going to use a vacuum.
[18:43.250 --> 18:45.170]  Get those seeds out.
[18:45.170 --> 18:46.170]  Wear gloves.
[18:46.170 --> 18:47.170]  I recommend gloves.
[18:47.170 --> 18:50.810]  Also, if you're going to use the seed sorting machines, maybe a mask because it blows a lot
[18:50.810 --> 18:51.930]  of dust around.
[18:51.930 --> 18:55.330]  You do get the green boogers from that, which are never pleasant.
[18:55.330 --> 18:59.770]  Then very important, once the seeds are out of the material, label them.
[18:59.770 --> 19:04.210]  Whatever baggie, jar, whatever it goes into, make sure that gets labeled properly.
[19:04.210 --> 19:09.010]  I like to label it what the male plant was, the female plant was, what the cross is called,
[19:09.010 --> 19:10.410]  and the date of the harvest.
[19:10.410 --> 19:14.370]  That way I kind of have an idea how old those seeds are when they came out of the plants.
[19:14.370 --> 19:15.370]  Lets me know what's going on.
[19:15.370 --> 19:18.490]  That way if there's a problem, I know that it came from this batch.
[19:18.490 --> 19:21.410]  Just helps me out with a little bit of ... Just helps me out.
[19:21.410 --> 19:22.410]  That's all.
[19:22.410 --> 19:24.730]  Then the best part, grow the seeds.
[19:24.730 --> 19:25.730]  Grow the seeds.
[19:25.730 --> 19:26.730]  You've made some cool seeds.
[19:26.730 --> 19:27.970]  You've got them out of your buds.
[19:27.970 --> 19:28.970]  Now you've got to grow them.
[19:28.970 --> 19:32.410]  Before you sell them, share them, pass them along, grow them.
[19:32.410 --> 19:34.850]  Make sure you didn't just make total garbage.
[19:34.850 --> 19:38.930]  Don't ask for money for seeds that you haven't tested because who knows what you've got.
[19:38.930 --> 19:39.930]  Could be all boys.
[19:39.930 --> 19:40.930]  It could be all intersex.
[19:40.930 --> 19:41.930]  It could be mutants.
[19:41.930 --> 19:47.210]  Or maybe you just made the new hottest fire on the market.
[19:47.210 --> 19:48.930]  Store your seeds in a cool, dry, dark place.
[19:48.930 --> 19:51.370]  By now they should be super dry.
[19:51.370 --> 19:53.810]  If you followed my method, the seeds are dry.
[19:53.810 --> 19:54.890]  They're ready to be stored.
[19:54.890 --> 19:57.290]  But make sure they're nice and dry before you do seal them up.
[19:57.290 --> 20:01.770]  If not, you do risk the opportunity for mold and pathogens in your seeds.
[20:01.770 --> 20:04.010]  So let them get nice and dry.
[20:04.010 --> 20:09.370]  Then label them correctly and store them in a cool, dry, dark place.
[20:09.370 --> 20:15.090]  I think that does wrap up my seed harvest episode.
[20:15.090 --> 20:18.170]  If you have any more questions about harvesting seeds, maybe we should talk a little bit about
[20:18.170 --> 20:19.170]  seed storage.
[20:19.170 --> 20:20.250]  Let's write that down.
[20:20.250 --> 20:25.290]  Seed storage may be an upcoming episode because that seems like the next logical step.
[20:25.290 --> 20:29.890]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[20:29.890 --> 20:34.450]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts, every member
