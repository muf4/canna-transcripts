[00:00.000 --> 00:01.320]  All right, here we go.
[00:01.320 --> 00:02.960]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.960 --> 00:07.500]  It is time for episode 459 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.500 --> 00:10.720]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:10.720 --> 00:15.620]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:15.620 --> 00:23.600]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:23.600 --> 00:27.160]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:27.160 --> 00:31.960]  Today I've been taking dabs of Double OG Full Spectrum Extract from our friends at
[00:31.960 --> 00:33.360]  Green Dot Labs.
[00:33.360 --> 00:37.980]  This is a four gram jar, and it is ridiculously terpy.
[00:37.980 --> 00:43.680]  As soon as I open this jar, it smells like gas, and pine sol, and funk in the entire
[00:43.680 --> 00:44.680]  room.
[00:44.680 --> 00:48.780]  The Double OG is a blend of Legends OG and Sour Double.
[00:48.780 --> 00:51.880]  The flavor is described as pine, sour, and lemons.
[00:51.880 --> 00:54.400]  I find that to be a perfect description.
[00:54.400 --> 01:01.520]  The potency label says that this product contains 74.73% THC and zero CBD.
[01:01.520 --> 01:07.040]  I really love the flavor, the aroma, and the buzz from the Double OG.
[01:07.040 --> 01:11.360]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and always perfect
[01:11.360 --> 01:12.360]  concentrates.
[01:12.360 --> 01:14.400]  All right, Podcast World.
[01:14.400 --> 01:17.080]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of emails.
[01:17.080 --> 01:22.440]  Before we get there, I would like to do some shout outs to a few of our friends from Patreon.
[01:22.440 --> 01:25.600]  Let's start off with a big Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out and a thank you
[01:25.600 --> 01:26.600]  to David OQ.
[01:26.600 --> 01:30.040]  How about a Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to Ryan S.
[01:30.040 --> 01:34.160]  I want to send a Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you to our friends out at Hogan's
[01:34.160 --> 01:35.200]  Farms.
[01:35.200 --> 01:37.960]  As always, let's give a big shout out and a thank you to Tanner M.
[01:37.960 --> 01:42.000]  I want to send a Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out and a Viking handshake to
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.040]  my friend Grimbolded Druid.
[01:44.040 --> 01:46.800]  Also I want to send a Giant shout out to Squirrel Tactics.
[01:46.800 --> 01:49.520]  And of course, a Giant shout out to my friend Mike H.
[01:49.640 --> 01:54.400]  And last but certainly not least, a Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out and
[01:54.400 --> 01:56.200]  a thank you to my friend Aldridge.
[01:56.200 --> 02:01.280]  I want to thank each and every one of you for continuing to support the show on Patreon.

[02:10.000 --> 02:13.640]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:13.640 --> 02:17.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I said that I was going to read some listener emails.
[02:17.840 --> 02:19.180]  Let's get right to it.
[02:19.840 --> 02:22.740]  This first email comes from a person who signed their message as Mark.
[02:22.740 --> 02:24.500]  So big shout out to our friend Mark.
[02:24.500 --> 02:26.380]  The message goes like this.
[02:26.380 --> 02:27.780]  Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[02:27.780 --> 02:30.300]  I have a few questions about passive vents.
[02:30.300 --> 02:34.460]  And I'm pretty sure that they mean passive vents when growing in a grow tent.
[02:34.460 --> 02:35.460]  So I will continue.
[02:35.460 --> 02:41.660]  It says, my tent barely has any negative pressure to it unless my passive vents are closed.
[02:41.660 --> 02:43.980]  Should these vents not be fully open?
[02:43.980 --> 02:44.980]  I'm also some...
[02:44.980 --> 02:47.660]  Okay, so let's focus on the first part of the question here.
[02:47.660 --> 02:52.820]  When we're growing in a grow tent, it is ideal to have some sort of ventilation sucking
[02:52.820 --> 02:58.140]  that old air out of the tent and causing some sort of passive suction to bring fresh air
[02:58.140 --> 02:59.140]  into the tent.
[02:59.140 --> 03:01.400]  I like to put a six inch blower right at the top.
[03:01.400 --> 03:03.340]  There's always that hole at the top of the grow tent.
[03:03.340 --> 03:06.900]  I set a six inch blower right on top of the tent on the outside.
[03:06.900 --> 03:08.460]  I run ducting into the tent.
[03:08.460 --> 03:10.260]  I run the ducting as appropriate.
[03:10.260 --> 03:14.240]  If I'm running ducted lights or if I've got a carbon filter, I adjust as necessary.
[03:14.240 --> 03:19.400]  But I like to utilize an extraction fan of some sort in a grow tent to always be removing
[03:19.400 --> 03:25.520]  stale stagnant air and humidity while replacing that with fresh CO2 enriched air.
[03:25.520 --> 03:29.240]  So imagine if you zip up your grow tent and you've got a six inch blower sucking air out
[03:29.240 --> 03:33.040]  of the top, the air has to come in from somewhere.
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.240]  Most of those grow tents come with passive vents on the bottom.
[03:37.240 --> 03:41.720]  All you have to do is undo a Velcro, little Velcro flap, and it rolls right up and you've
[03:41.720 --> 03:44.520]  got a passive air vent for air to come in.
[03:44.520 --> 03:49.920]  Now what this person is asking about is he's saying that he is barely getting any suction
[03:49.920 --> 03:52.200]  on the tent when he closes it up.
[03:52.200 --> 03:53.840]  That tent should cave in just a little bit.
[03:53.840 --> 03:55.040]  It should look like it breathed in.
[03:55.040 --> 03:58.760]  It should look like somebody trying to suck in their gut and get in some skinny jeans.
[03:58.760 --> 04:00.160]  That's kind of what the tent should look like.
[04:00.160 --> 04:03.960]  You are sucking all the air out of it and that air is not being replenished quickly
[04:03.960 --> 04:06.440]  enough, so it kind of caves in a little bit.
[04:06.440 --> 04:08.840]  We call that negative pressure because it is negative.
[04:08.840 --> 04:09.840]  It's being sucked in.
[04:09.960 --> 04:11.920]  The positive pressure would be blowing it out.
[04:11.920 --> 04:13.240]  So we've got negative pressure.
[04:13.240 --> 04:17.240]  We're trying to get negative pressure so that we can suck that old stale air right out of
[04:17.240 --> 04:20.920]  the top and then use those passive vents just to bring fresh air from the room right in.
[04:20.920 --> 04:23.360]  We don't have to employ another blower or anything.
[04:23.360 --> 04:26.240]  The air will just come in naturally through displacement.
[04:26.240 --> 04:31.300]  So our listener, our friend here is concerned that the tent is barely getting any negative
[04:31.300 --> 04:34.280]  pressure unless the passive vents are closed.
[04:34.280 --> 04:37.020]  And then they ask, should they not be fully open?
[04:37.020 --> 04:41.540]  As long as that air is circulating from that tent and as long as the temps and humidity
[04:41.540 --> 04:47.420]  and VPD are stabilized and balanced appropriately in that tent, you can adjust those flaps as
[04:47.420 --> 04:48.460]  needed.
[04:48.460 --> 04:53.560]  You don't have to see extreme suction on that tent, but that lets you know that it is working.
[04:53.560 --> 04:55.820]  That knows you were getting a rapid air exchange.
[04:55.820 --> 05:00.620]  As long as it's sucking in a little bit, that shows you you are getting sufficient air exchange.
[05:00.620 --> 05:04.940]  The most important thing is to pay attention to the temperature and humidity.
[05:04.940 --> 05:09.000]  And overall, the most important thing is to pay attention to the plants.
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.500]  Are the plants happy with what's going on in there?
[05:11.500 --> 05:14.900]  If the plants are okay with it, you don't need to change anything.
[05:14.900 --> 05:19.340]  If the plants are showing you that they are unhappy, we can use the information from the
[05:19.340 --> 05:23.820]  plants and we can compare that to the information from your monitors and we can dial it in and
[05:23.820 --> 05:26.740]  diagnose the problem and make corrections from there.
[05:26.740 --> 05:31.420]  But if you don't see any problems, there is no need to change anything.
[05:31.420 --> 05:34.300]  Feel free to experiment with those passive vents.
[05:34.300 --> 05:37.900]  If you've got them fully open and you're not satisfied with the amount of negative
[05:37.900 --> 05:40.660]  pressure, maybe close one of them.
[05:40.660 --> 05:43.180]  Maybe close both of them halfway.
[05:43.180 --> 05:45.400]  Maybe seal them up completely and see what happens.
[05:45.400 --> 05:50.140]  Maybe you've got enough air coming in through the natural gaps in that material where you
[05:50.140 --> 05:53.340]  can replace that air just from sucking it in that way.
[05:53.340 --> 05:54.940]  Feel free to experiment.
[05:54.940 --> 05:58.580]  You can play with the airflow for a few minutes in that room and not cause too many major
[05:58.580 --> 06:00.060]  problems to the plants.
[06:00.060 --> 06:01.620]  You'll know if it's getting too hot.
[06:01.620 --> 06:02.940]  You'll know if it's getting too humid.
[06:02.940 --> 06:04.900]  You should be right there paying attention.
[06:04.900 --> 06:06.460]  Don't let it go for too long.
[06:06.460 --> 06:10.740]  Put your hygrometer, your thermometer, or your PL grow minder unit in there and pay
[06:10.740 --> 06:12.860]  close attention to what's happening.
[06:12.860 --> 06:17.180]  So as long as you are exchanging that air sufficiently and you do not see any problems
[06:17.180 --> 06:22.420]  with the plants, I don't think it is necessary to freak out too much over the adjustment
[06:22.420 --> 06:25.420]  of the passive vent settings on your tent.
[06:25.420 --> 06:27.420]  I still work with a grow tent in one area.
[06:27.420 --> 06:30.660]  I've got a five by five grow tent with a thousand watt light in there.
[06:30.660 --> 06:35.860]  I like to put that six inch vortex blower right on top to suck the air out of that tent.
[06:35.860 --> 06:38.580]  That six inch blower is way more than enough.
[06:38.580 --> 06:42.660]  I'm not sure how powerful of a blower or an extraction fan you are using, but I know that
[06:42.660 --> 06:46.600]  my six inch does way more than enough air circulation.
[06:46.600 --> 06:49.900]  If you've got a four inch blower, it is probably sufficient.
[06:49.900 --> 06:51.300]  I would set up a hygrometer.
[06:51.300 --> 06:52.460]  I would set up a thermometer.
[06:52.460 --> 06:57.060]  I would set up a PL grow minder unit if that is available to you, and I would pay attention
[06:57.140 --> 07:01.620]  to the temperature and the humidity and the VPD in that grow environment.
[07:01.620 --> 07:08.100]  I would pay close attention to the conditions right before and right after your light cycle changes.
[07:08.100 --> 07:12.380]  So 15 minutes before the lights go off, look and see what your temperature and humidity are.
[07:12.380 --> 07:16.100]  Then pay attention to that for the next 30 to 45 minutes and see what it does and do
[07:16.100 --> 07:18.540]  the same thing when the lights come on.
[07:18.540 --> 07:22.660]  That way you can know where your peaks and valleys are in your humidity and temperature
[07:22.660 --> 07:26.120]  swings and you can adjust accordingly if necessary.
[07:26.120 --> 07:29.400]  If it's getting too humid or too hot, maybe allow more airflow.
[07:29.400 --> 07:33.260]  If it's staying too dry in there, maybe minimize the airflow.
[07:33.260 --> 07:37.800]  Pay attention to the plants, pay attention to your monitors, and then adjust if necessary.
[07:37.800 --> 07:41.400]  If nothing needs to be done, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[07:41.400 --> 07:42.760]  Let the plants be happy.
[07:42.760 --> 07:44.400]  Now there is more to this question.
[07:44.400 --> 07:47.680]  It says I'm also semi-close to a window.
[07:47.680 --> 07:51.160]  How can I prevent light leaks into these when I move into flower?
[07:51.160 --> 07:56.160]  Is it possible to put a black bug screen taped over the passive vents that also prevent
[07:56.160 --> 07:58.120]  light from getting in?
[07:58.120 --> 08:03.020]  Also do both need to be opened to create even airflow?
[08:03.020 --> 08:04.020]  Both do not need to be open.
[08:04.020 --> 08:05.960]  I mentioned earlier that you can open one.
[08:05.960 --> 08:09.520]  I would recommend putting a fan or something inside there to stir that air as it comes
[08:09.520 --> 08:12.920]  in so you don't just get air going in one side right out the top.
[08:12.920 --> 08:14.880]  I would absolutely have a fan in there.
[08:14.880 --> 08:18.560]  Stirring that, you should have a fan in the grow tent anyway, mixing the air to prevent
[08:18.560 --> 08:23.360]  microclimates, to stir around that CO2, to move around that humidity, to help prevent
[08:23.360 --> 08:24.560]  PM problems.
[08:24.560 --> 08:26.160]  I think a fan is beneficial.
[08:26.160 --> 08:27.160]  I think you would be okay.
[08:27.160 --> 08:32.440]  It's probably such a small area that that fan is not going to be critical.
[08:32.440 --> 08:35.560]  And by moving in some air, I think displacement will work for you.
[08:35.560 --> 08:37.780]  You will get enough circulation in a small area.
[08:37.780 --> 08:40.980]  So no, you don't need to open both vents at the same time.
[08:40.980 --> 08:43.400]  If you can do them both 50-50, that's cool.
[08:43.400 --> 08:44.800]  If not, you'll be okay.
[08:44.800 --> 08:45.960]  It's not that big of a space.
[08:45.960 --> 08:48.040]  The air will move itself around.
[08:48.040 --> 08:50.320]  Put a fan in there that'll solve that problem.
[08:50.320 --> 08:51.440]  Let's talk about the window.
[08:51.440 --> 08:54.120]  You were worried about light leaks.
[08:54.120 --> 08:58.120]  Most of the grow tents are sufficiently made to where they do not leak light.
[08:58.120 --> 09:02.460]  I understand that we want to be extra careful and get zero light in our tent.
[09:02.460 --> 09:05.480]  So I like that you were trying to be prepared before we go into flower.
[09:05.480 --> 09:07.120]  You've got a couple of options.
[09:07.120 --> 09:12.320]  You can absolutely put some of that black shade cloth over those vents.
[09:12.320 --> 09:15.120]  But I would focus more on covering the window.
[09:15.120 --> 09:16.840]  The window is where the light is coming in.
[09:16.840 --> 09:18.560]  I would just work on blocking that out.
[09:18.560 --> 09:20.720]  I understand it is probably in your home.
[09:20.720 --> 09:21.760]  That may not be an option.
[09:21.760 --> 09:23.640]  That may be a window that you need to use.
[09:23.640 --> 09:25.320]  That may be a spot where you need some sunshine.
[09:25.320 --> 09:28.880]  It may make things look weird if you just go put a black curtain over that.
[09:28.880 --> 09:32.360]  I would put a black curtain up to where the people outside see a black curtain.
[09:32.360 --> 09:36.280]  And then I would staple some Panda film over the black curtain so that no light can get
[09:36.280 --> 09:37.280]  in.
[09:37.280 --> 09:39.000]  Only the people on the inside see the Panda film.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.160]  People on the outside see a curtain.
[09:40.160 --> 09:42.260]  It looks just like a normal bedroom window.
[09:42.260 --> 09:43.680]  You can get away with that.
[09:43.680 --> 09:47.460]  But if you can't cover the window, you can absolutely put some of that shade cloth over
[09:47.460 --> 09:48.460]  those vents.
[09:48.460 --> 09:51.920]  Or what you can do is not Velcro the flaps up.
[09:51.920 --> 09:55.300]  If you just let them hang and don't Velcro them down or up to where they're just kind
[09:55.300 --> 10:00.180]  of hanging, when the air flows, it'll lift the flaps up enough to allow the air to move
[10:00.180 --> 10:01.180]  through.
[10:01.180 --> 10:05.160]  But I don't think it will lift up enough to allow the light to get in there.
[10:05.160 --> 10:07.400]  Also, that is way toward the floor.
[10:07.400 --> 10:10.680]  Hopefully your window and your floor aren't near the same height.
[10:10.680 --> 10:12.640]  Hopefully you got a good three feet between there toward the light.
[10:12.640 --> 10:16.080]  It would have to go down, get into that vent, work its way back up.
[10:16.080 --> 10:20.380]  I honestly block out all of the windows in any room where I put a grow tent.
[10:20.380 --> 10:22.660]  So I usually don't have to deal with this type of a thing.
[10:22.660 --> 10:26.400]  My first advice is to block out the window in the grow room.
[10:26.400 --> 10:30.600]  If that is not an option, my next move would be to cover those vents with a bit of shade
[10:30.600 --> 10:34.520]  cloth or perhaps just leave those flaps down to where the light can't get in.
[10:34.520 --> 10:39.940]  Maybe put the shade cloth over it and leave the flaps down and then see how much passive
[10:39.940 --> 10:44.660]  air is allowed to get into that tent once you activate that blower at full speed.
[10:44.660 --> 10:48.140]  When you let those vents, those flaps lay down on their own and then you put that cover
[10:48.140 --> 10:51.540]  over there, that may create the negative pressure you were looking for.
[10:51.540 --> 10:53.820]  You may not be able to get enough air flowing through there.
[10:53.820 --> 10:55.260]  You may be sucking out a lot of air.
[10:55.260 --> 10:59.420]  That restriction may give you the negative pressure you were seeking.
[10:59.420 --> 11:05.780]  However you decide to troubleshoot this or remedy this situation, I strongly suggest
[11:05.780 --> 11:06.780]  that you do.
[11:06.780 --> 11:07.780]  I'm not saying that you should do it.
[11:07.780 --> 11:10.460]  I'm just saying that when your flowering cycle begins, you spend some time in that grow tent
[11:10.460 --> 11:13.460]  at lights out time and see what happens in there.
[11:13.460 --> 11:18.780]  Yes, you physically go in there, turn off the lights in the grow room, leave everything
[11:18.780 --> 11:20.740]  else just like it would normally be.
[11:20.740 --> 11:24.700]  If the lights in your grow tent go out at five o'clock and the lights in the bedroom
[11:24.700 --> 11:29.260]  would be on and the sun is up and all of that shit, do it just like it normally would be.
[11:29.260 --> 11:33.660]  Go in that tent, turn off the grow light, have somebody seal you in there, wait a few
[11:33.660 --> 11:34.660]  minutes.
[11:34.660 --> 11:35.660]  Your eyes need a few minutes to adjust.
[11:35.660 --> 11:40.220]  Your eyes may need three to five, maybe seven to 10 minutes to adjust to the total darkness
[11:40.220 --> 11:42.180]  and see if there are any light leaks.
[11:42.180 --> 11:44.180]  Can you see little pinpricks of light anywhere?
[11:44.180 --> 11:46.740]  Can you see your hand in front of your face?
[11:46.740 --> 11:51.980]  Something that happens quite often is we run ducting into the grow over the ducted light
[11:51.980 --> 11:57.420]  hood and then back out and somehow the light from outside comes through that ducting.
[11:57.420 --> 12:02.560]  If you've got ducting going in or out of your grow tent, make sure there is not light going
[12:02.560 --> 12:04.380]  up that duct.
[12:04.380 --> 12:09.860]  Unfortunately, much of the ducting we are sold is wrapped with an aluminum reflective
[12:09.860 --> 12:15.060]  type coating on the inside and that really reflects light all the way down the damn duct.
[12:15.060 --> 12:18.040]  So you get the light just bouncing all the way down the duct.
[12:18.040 --> 12:22.380]  If you've got that ducting going outside or into another room and then you've got that
[12:22.380 --> 12:27.180]  ducting going to your vented light hood that is inside of the grow tent, that works just
[12:27.180 --> 12:28.180]  like a grow light.
[12:28.180 --> 12:31.580]  It illuminates the whole damn grow tent just like a grow light would.
[12:31.580 --> 12:35.380]  If you don't go in there and look, you may never realize it's even happening.
[12:35.380 --> 12:37.020]  Your plants will not flower properly.
[12:37.020 --> 12:41.260]  You'll be sitting there for weeks wondering why they look like shit.
[12:41.260 --> 12:45.580]  So I certainly suggest that at the beginning of your flowering phase on day one, you go
[12:45.580 --> 12:48.900]  in there and find out what is happening during your dark cycle.
[12:48.900 --> 12:49.900]  Is it dark?
[12:49.900 --> 12:50.900]  Are there light leaks?
[12:50.900 --> 12:52.220]  Do we need to make adjustments?
[12:52.220 --> 12:57.060]  Let's find out on day one instead of 10 days into flower when everything looks like complete
[12:57.060 --> 12:58.060]  shit.
[12:58.220 --> 13:02.340]  So I think by blocking out the light, we are going to work on your negative pressure issue
[13:02.340 --> 13:05.580]  and all of these problems will solve themselves together.
[13:05.580 --> 13:10.140]  Just make sure you go in there and make sure that that is absolutely dark during your dark
[13:10.140 --> 13:11.140]  phase.
[13:11.140 --> 13:13.260]  Hey Mark, I want to thank you for the great email.
[13:13.260 --> 13:16.540]  If you have any more questions or if you've got a follow up, please reach out.
[13:16.540 --> 13:20.220]  I'm sure you remember the email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[13:20.220 --> 13:26.100]  All right, I've got some good momentum going, so let's just keep moving right into the next
[13:26.100 --> 13:27.100]  email.
[13:27.140 --> 13:29.420]  And the next message goes like this.
[13:29.420 --> 13:34.420]  It says, hello Rasta Jeff, I'm a new big time fan of your podcast.
[13:34.420 --> 13:38.340]  I just started listening to you this week and I'm like a quarter way through.
[13:38.340 --> 13:42.100]  Holy shit dude, you've listened to a hundred and something episodes in a week.
[13:42.100 --> 13:43.100]  Thank you.
[13:43.100 --> 13:45.540]  I hope you're taking notes and I hope you are learning a lot and it's great to hear
[13:45.540 --> 13:49.300]  that you are a big time fan of the podcast after just finding us.
[13:49.300 --> 13:50.300]  I appreciate that.
[13:50.300 --> 13:51.300]  Let's keep moving.
[13:51.300 --> 13:56.660]  It says, I've been having some issues eating and sleeping as of the past two years.
[13:56.660 --> 14:02.140]  Myself and big pharma don't mix at all and lab medicine makes me feel worse.
[14:02.140 --> 14:07.700]  I've been a cannabis advocate for years, seeing many people in my family use and lead very
[14:07.700 --> 14:09.380]  productive lives.
[14:09.380 --> 14:13.060]  I'm trying to get a medical marijuana card, but my doctor is giving me the hardest time
[14:13.060 --> 14:16.580]  about it and every visit just turns into me being preached to.
[14:16.580 --> 14:18.500]  That has got to be so frustrating.
[14:18.500 --> 14:22.680]  We go to the doctor looking for relief and they're probably getting paid by a pharmaceutical
[14:22.680 --> 14:27.240]  company to recommend you a prescription and giving you cannabis is the last thing they
[14:27.240 --> 14:31.240]  want to do because that is actually going to help you and make you feel better.
[14:31.240 --> 14:33.320]  That is not good business for a doctor.
[14:33.320 --> 14:36.140]  So I understand how frustrating that can get.
[14:36.140 --> 14:37.140]  Let's keep moving.
[14:37.140 --> 14:38.640]  It says, I live in a prohibition state.
[14:38.640 --> 14:40.720]  Well then how are you trying to get weed from your doctor?
[14:40.720 --> 14:42.520]  It must be a medical marijuana state.
[14:42.520 --> 14:46.760]  I live in a prohibition state and as a new father and husband, I refuse to put my family
[14:46.760 --> 14:52.200]  in danger by dealing with the extremely shady dealers where I live and not to mention, I
[14:52.200 --> 14:54.040]  don't know what they do to their buds.
[14:54.040 --> 14:55.520]  Yes, absolutely.
[14:55.520 --> 14:58.200]  Sometimes buying product off the street can be a little bit scary.
[14:58.200 --> 15:02.200]  There's a big debate about the black market versus the legal market.
[15:02.200 --> 15:06.240]  One of the things that I am concerned with on the black market is nobody is required
[15:06.240 --> 15:08.540]  to have any sort of pesticide training.
[15:08.540 --> 15:11.280]  So who knows what they are applying to the plants.
[15:11.280 --> 15:15.400]  A lot of people say that the things applied in a commercial grow are dangerous, but we
[15:15.400 --> 15:16.640]  have to document it.
[15:16.640 --> 15:19.880]  We are very regulated and things undergo lab testing.
[15:19.880 --> 15:24.700]  When a black market grow, it goes from the black market to your bong without any sort
[15:24.700 --> 15:25.700]  of regulation.
[15:25.700 --> 15:27.080]  So who knows what's going on there?
[15:27.080 --> 15:28.480]  You were absolutely correct.
[15:28.480 --> 15:29.640]  Let's get us back on track.
[15:29.640 --> 15:34.400]  It says, I have done tons of research and watched hours of video and I feel I am ready
[15:34.400 --> 15:35.640]  to grow my own.
[15:35.640 --> 15:39.960]  Yeah, I want to give you a huge compliment because you did this in the right order.
[15:39.960 --> 15:44.640]  You watched videos and did tons of research and now you feel like you are ready to grow
[15:44.640 --> 15:45.640]  your own.
[15:45.760 --> 15:49.920]  In a previous episode, we had somebody who grew their own and then when things went to
[15:49.920 --> 15:53.760]  shit, they decided to do some research and reach out for help because they made a major
[15:53.760 --> 15:54.760]  mistake.
[15:54.760 --> 15:57.200]  So I'm proud of you for doing this the correct way.
[15:57.200 --> 15:58.760]  Big fist bump for that.
[15:58.760 --> 15:59.760]  Let's keep moving.
[15:59.760 --> 16:03.200]  It says, the only thing I'm not sure is where to get seeds.
[16:03.200 --> 16:05.240]  I do know I want to try auto flowers.
[16:05.240 --> 16:10.840]  I was wondering if you knew a fast strain I could try and a seed bank to order from
[16:10.840 --> 16:16.200]  because I keep reading a mixed bag of information about them and I don't really have anyone
[16:16.200 --> 16:19.480]  to guide me in the right direction.
[16:19.480 --> 16:22.520]  I do have some good guidance here, but you may not like part of it.
[16:22.520 --> 16:25.440]  I am not a fan of auto flowering cannabis.
[16:25.440 --> 16:29.960]  I feel like if you were a brand new grower, you should learn how to grow photo period
[16:29.960 --> 16:31.160]  cannabis.
[16:31.160 --> 16:33.760]  There's nothing wrong with auto flower plants.
[16:33.760 --> 16:38.120]  I just feel that as a new grower, you would learn more, you would have a more enjoyable
[16:38.120 --> 16:43.320]  experience and you could probably build a better understanding of the plant if you
[16:43.320 --> 16:48.520]  were able to experience an actual vegetative cycle where you could work with the plant
[16:48.520 --> 16:50.800]  and do things to improve the yield.
[16:50.800 --> 16:54.720]  And then you can choose when to flower the plant by changing the timer.
[16:54.720 --> 16:59.160]  It just builds a different understanding and a different relationship of the plant.
[16:59.160 --> 17:02.760]  There is absolutely nothing wrong with growing auto flower plants.
[17:02.760 --> 17:06.520]  If that is what you want to do, if that is what is going to make you happy, you do that.
[17:06.520 --> 17:07.600]  Don't let me slow you down.
[17:07.600 --> 17:09.520]  Do not let me get in your way.
[17:09.520 --> 17:10.520]  Do that shit.
[17:10.520 --> 17:11.960]  Get a smile on your face.
[17:11.960 --> 17:12.960]  Live your dreams.
[17:12.960 --> 17:18.640]  However, I feel like it would be beneficial if you grew regular seeds for your first couple
[17:18.640 --> 17:23.560]  of runs until you understand the nuances of the cannabis plant.
[17:23.560 --> 17:26.160]  Auto flowers are great in certain applications.
[17:26.160 --> 17:29.080]  Auto flowers are great for certain environments.
[17:29.080 --> 17:34.800]  But again, I feel like a beginner grower would learn more and have a more enjoyable experience
[17:34.800 --> 17:36.980]  by growing from a regular seed.
[17:36.980 --> 17:41.620]  And that is not because I make regular seeds and feminize seeds and I do not make auto
[17:41.620 --> 17:42.620]  flowers.
[17:42.620 --> 17:47.540]  That's just how I feel as an educator, as a passionate person about cannabis.
[17:47.540 --> 17:51.940]  I feel like you've got the opportunity and the potential to learn more from growing from
[17:51.940 --> 17:54.580]  regular seeds for your first grow.
[17:54.580 --> 17:58.620]  Now having said that, you may still want to buy auto flower seeds.
[17:58.620 --> 18:05.660]  If you're going to buy auto flower seeds, I do recommend Mephisto Genetics as your breeder.
[18:05.660 --> 18:09.660]  Mephisto makes very reliable auto flowers.
[18:09.660 --> 18:14.500]  Now I understand why you may be drawn to auto flowers for your first grow.
[18:14.500 --> 18:16.140]  There are many advantages.
[18:16.140 --> 18:20.740]  There are also a few disadvantages when growing auto flowers.
[18:20.740 --> 18:27.020]  If your main reason for wanting to grow an auto flower plant is speed and ease of grow,
[18:27.020 --> 18:31.100]  I advise you to rethink your strategy.
[18:31.100 --> 18:35.560]  Everybody wants the quickest, easiest grow that they can produce.
[18:35.560 --> 18:38.760]  But that is not the goal with cannabis.
[18:38.760 --> 18:40.560]  Cannabis takes time.
[18:40.560 --> 18:42.000]  Cannabis takes patience.
[18:42.000 --> 18:48.000]  And most of all, quality cannabis takes effort and attention to detail.
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.860]  You can achieve all of those things with an auto flower plant.
[18:52.860 --> 18:58.120]  But as a new grower, I would recommend and prefer to see you learn the basics of the
[18:58.120 --> 19:02.800]  cannabis plant before we go looking for shortcuts.
[19:02.800 --> 19:08.640]  Get a good crop of regular cannabis under your belt and get that experience.
[19:08.640 --> 19:10.080]  Develop that relationship.
[19:10.080 --> 19:12.680]  See what a veg cycle is like.
[19:12.680 --> 19:14.240]  Learn how to cut clones.
[19:14.240 --> 19:19.060]  Try to grow your clones in your next cycle so that you can become self-reliant.
[19:19.060 --> 19:24.520]  With an auto flower seed, you have to buy seeds every time, and they are quite pricey.
[19:24.520 --> 19:31.000]  Auto flower feminized seeds are very expensive compared to regular or feminized photo period
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.000]  seeds.
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.520]  I feel like if you used regular photo period seeds, it would change your mindset and get
[19:37.520 --> 19:42.680]  you away from the, I want to go fast and be Ricky Bobby and have a crop of weed in just
[19:42.680 --> 19:47.200]  a few weeks so that I can have a finished product without maximum effort.
[19:47.200 --> 19:52.960]  I think you would respect and appreciate your garden a little bit better if you started
[19:52.960 --> 19:56.880]  off with regular photo period plants.
[19:56.880 --> 20:01.600]  There are things you do not have to learn and think about when you're growing auto flowers.
[20:01.600 --> 20:06.040]  In the future, those things you did not learn and the things you did not think about may
[20:06.040 --> 20:11.960]  be your crutch and may be what slows you down from being the best grower that you can possibly
[20:11.960 --> 20:12.960]  be.
[20:12.960 --> 20:17.080]  I really want people to set themselves up for success from the beginning.
[20:17.080 --> 20:19.520]  That's a phrase you're going to hear from me a lot.
[20:19.520 --> 20:22.860]  Set yourself up for success from the beginning.
[20:22.860 --> 20:26.760]  You can see when a project starts, the potential it's got of succeeding.
[20:26.760 --> 20:28.680]  You can tell if it's going to crash and burn.
[20:28.680 --> 20:33.160]  You can quite often see that as the project is being put together.
[20:33.160 --> 20:34.920]  Set yourself up for success.
[20:34.920 --> 20:36.440]  The world is a struggle.
[20:36.440 --> 20:40.760]  There are always going to be obstacles and problems and surprises.
[20:40.760 --> 20:43.400]  Try to be prepared for all of those obstacles.
[20:43.400 --> 20:45.680]  Try to foresee those surprises.
[20:45.680 --> 20:50.260]  When shit pops up that sets you back, if you have set yourself up for success the best
[20:50.260 --> 20:55.760]  way possible, those little obstacles will be exactly that, tiny obstacles.
[20:55.840 --> 21:00.160]  If you did not make the proper preparation in the beginning, that tiny obstacle can be
[21:00.160 --> 21:03.920]  a giant fucking hurdle later on in the road.
[21:03.920 --> 21:08.680]  Set yourself up for success from the very beginning.
[21:08.680 --> 21:09.840]  I want you to be successful.
[21:09.840 --> 21:13.840]  I want you to get the seeds that are going to work for you, but I also want you to do
[21:13.840 --> 21:16.200]  what is going to make you happy.
[21:16.200 --> 21:19.640]  How passionate are you going to be if you buy some seeds that you don't even like because
[21:19.640 --> 21:21.620]  that's what Rostagev said to do?
[21:21.620 --> 21:22.680]  That's going to be bullshit.
[21:22.680 --> 21:24.080]  You won't even enjoy it.
[21:24.080 --> 21:27.800]  Do what is going to make you happy, but I would love to see you learn how to work a
[21:27.800 --> 21:28.800]  veg phase.
[21:28.800 --> 21:33.600]  I would love to see you learn how to manipulate and pop and twist some plants.
[21:33.600 --> 21:36.920]  Then you get to flip the light cycle and decide when they go into flower.
[21:36.920 --> 21:41.000]  Now you can document exactly how many days those plants are in flower.
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.520]  I think you would get a better relationship and a better education with the cannabis plant
[21:45.520 --> 21:48.520]  if you chose to go with a photo period seed.
[21:48.520 --> 21:51.040]  You can do regulars or you can do feminized.
[21:51.040 --> 21:52.760]  I just recommend the photos.
[21:53.480 --> 21:58.120]  Overall of those recommendations, I recommend you do what you want and what makes you happy
[21:58.120 --> 22:02.360]  because that is the most important part of growing this plant.
[22:02.360 --> 22:04.860]  Now let's talk about the other part of this email.
[22:04.860 --> 22:07.720]  You have said, the only thing is I'm not sure where to get seeds.
[22:07.720 --> 22:09.640]  I know I want to try autos.
[22:09.640 --> 22:12.320]  Then you ask about a seed bank you could try.
[22:12.320 --> 22:16.840]  You say that you keep hearing mixed bags of information about them and you don't have
[22:16.840 --> 22:18.880]  anyone to guide you in the right direction.
[22:18.880 --> 22:20.840]  Will you have come to the right place?
[22:20.840 --> 22:24.600]  I have worked with many of the seed vendors that are available.
[22:24.600 --> 22:31.360]  The first place I would recommend for seeds is always going to be seedsherenow.com.
[22:31.360 --> 22:37.040]  Seedsherenow.com has a wide selection of auto, of regular, of feminized seeds.
[22:37.040 --> 22:43.600]  You can get a plethora of great genetics from seeds here now from reputable breeders around
[22:43.600 --> 22:45.040]  the world.
[22:45.040 --> 22:49.840]  Seeds here now carry seeds from Canerato, from Duke Diamond, from Irie Genetics, and
[22:49.840 --> 22:53.520]  they've also got auto flower seeds from Mephisto.
[22:53.520 --> 22:56.960]  Make sure you check out seedsherenow.com for seeds.
[22:56.960 --> 23:01.480]  If they do not have what you are looking for, the next place I would send you would be the
[23:01.480 --> 23:03.600]  Hella Dank Seed Company.
[23:03.600 --> 23:07.560]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[23:07.560 --> 23:12.920]  They've got a great selection of breeders and genetics available on their website.
[23:12.920 --> 23:14.600]  They carry Irie Genetics.
[23:14.600 --> 23:16.360]  They should have Mephisto over there.
[23:16.360 --> 23:18.840]  I'm sure they've got Ethos Genetics over there.
[23:18.840 --> 23:21.240]  They've got a lot of great stuff to offer.
[23:21.240 --> 23:28.560]  Then another great reputable seed vendor I can suggest to you is Oregon Elite Seeds.
[23:28.560 --> 23:31.200]  Big shout out to my friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[23:31.200 --> 23:35.360]  They also carry many reputable, reliable breeders.
[23:35.360 --> 23:41.360]  They have got Irie Genetics over there, and they've also got a link to a large selection
[23:41.360 --> 23:43.440]  of auto flowering seeds.
[23:43.440 --> 23:45.760]  Those are three people I would recommend.
[23:45.760 --> 23:53.200]  seedsherenow.com, the helladankseedcompany at dankseed.store, and oregoneliteseeds at
[23:53.200 --> 23:54.200]  oregoneliteseeds.com.
[23:54.200 --> 24:01.280]  All right, he wraps up this email by saying, thanks for any help you can give me.
[24:01.280 --> 24:03.200]  You don't know how much you are appreciated.
[24:03.200 --> 24:07.040]  Hey, that means a lot to me just to know that I am appreciated.
[24:07.040 --> 24:11.440]  Recently I've been receiving a lot of praise through email, a lot of gratitude through
[24:11.440 --> 24:15.440]  social media, and my Patreon has definitely been jingling.
[24:15.640 --> 24:19.040]  I do notice all of the respect and appreciation.
[24:19.040 --> 24:22.720]  Thank you, that does mean a lot to me, and it is reciprocated.
[24:22.720 --> 24:23.720]  There is more.
[24:23.720 --> 24:28.880]  It says, even just being able to send this email to you makes me hopeful about my choice.
[24:28.880 --> 24:30.840]  Hey, I hope we're able to help you out.
[24:30.840 --> 24:34.520]  You did say that you were in prohibition land, but you asked your doctor about cannabis,
[24:34.520 --> 24:37.840]  so I'm hoping you are in a medical cannabis-friendly state.
[24:37.840 --> 24:40.880]  I'm hoping maybe you can find yourself a different doctor.
[24:40.880 --> 24:46.880]  If you are in a place where there is medical marijuana, there is a doctor ready, willing,
[24:46.880 --> 24:51.840]  and able to take your money to write you a medical cannabis recommendation.
[24:51.840 --> 24:54.880]  I don't know what it is in your area, but whatever they're going to write you, there
[24:54.880 --> 24:55.880]  is somebody there.
[24:55.880 --> 25:00.120]  They just want your money, and they will take your money to give you the appropriate paperwork.
[25:00.120 --> 25:04.120]  Once you've got that paperwork, that is when you need to set up to grow.
[25:04.120 --> 25:08.080]  That's when you need to go check out those websites and get yourself some great seeds.
[25:08.080 --> 25:10.040]  I hope everything goes well for you, man.
[25:10.040 --> 25:13.760]  If you need some help in the future, if you have any questions, please reach out.
[25:13.760 --> 25:15.060]  You know the email address.
[25:15.060 --> 25:17.840]  It is growfromyourheart.com.
[25:17.840 --> 25:20.600]  He signs the message with, thanks again, J Blaze.
[25:20.600 --> 25:22.840]  Hey, J Blaze, thank you for the great email.
[25:22.840 --> 25:24.880]  I hope things go well for you.
[25:24.880 --> 25:28.480]  Honestly, now I'm just super curious where you are because you said you're in prohibition
[25:28.480 --> 25:30.400]  land, but then you said you spoke to your doctor.
[25:30.400 --> 25:33.400]  I'm thinking you are in a newly medical state.
[25:33.400 --> 25:37.100]  If you have questions or need guidance to find a doctor that is more compassionate and
[25:37.100 --> 25:41.900]  willing to help you out, send myself or Mike an email or a message, and one of us, if not
[25:41.900 --> 25:47.340]  both of us, will get on helping you find an appropriate doctor to get you your appropriate
[25:47.340 --> 25:48.340]  medicine.
[25:48.340 --> 25:51.460]  Hey, White Mike, I hope you're listening to this episode, bro, because I just volunteered
[25:51.460 --> 25:56.060]  you to help this listener find a medical cannabis doctor in their area.
[25:56.060 --> 25:59.900]  All right, podcast world, that is all I have got for this episode of the Grow From Your
[25:59.900 --> 26:00.900]  Heart podcast.
[26:00.900 --> 26:02.900]  I want to thank everybody again for listening.
[26:02.900 --> 26:06.460]  I apologize that my voice has sounded kind of like crap through this entire episode.
[26:06.820 --> 26:07.820]  I tried to keep it together.
[26:07.820 --> 26:10.580]  It has fallen apart here at the end of the show.
[26:10.580 --> 26:14.320]  If you feel like this episode was educational, informative, or entertaining, and you'd like
