[00:00.000 --> 00:18.740]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:18.740 --> 00:21.420]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:21.420 --> 00:27.060]  This is episode 764 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:27.060 --> 00:30.340]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of Patreon messages.
[00:30.340 --> 00:33.660]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the great
[00:33.660 --> 00:37.840]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:37.840 --> 00:41.900]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to my buddy

[01:03.240 --> 01:05.760]  I want to send a big thank you to Commander Cochran.
[01:05.760 --> 01:09.800]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out
[01:09.860 --> 01:12.300]  to Curbside Gardens.
[01:12.300 --> 01:17.480]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:17.480 --> 01:21.220]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:21.220 --> 01:27.920]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:27.920 --> 01:30.720]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:30.720 --> 01:34.960]  And you know there is a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it super
[01:34.960 --> 01:38.840]  easy for all of my friends to support the podcast.
[01:38.840 --> 01:41.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not sure if you can still hear it in my voice.
[01:41.680 --> 01:43.240]  I can still feel it in my body.
[01:43.240 --> 01:47.880]  I'm still kind of recovering from the virus, the plague that I had for a little bit.
[01:47.880 --> 01:51.600]  So if this show feels a little bit low energy, a little bit slow, I do apologize.
[01:51.600 --> 01:53.960]  I'm up here doing my best.
[01:53.960 --> 01:55.680]  The virus kicked my ass dude.
[01:55.680 --> 02:00.120]  I feel like I've still got low energy and high temperature is how I felt.
[02:00.120 --> 02:01.760]  I'm still doing what I got to do.
[02:01.760 --> 02:05.520]  I'm trying to get my day going, get the world going, get the podcast going, the business
[02:05.520 --> 02:07.240]  going, taking care of the garden.
[02:07.240 --> 02:11.400]  Back in action, but I do take a little bit more breaks and it takes me longer to do things.
[02:11.400 --> 02:13.560]  Anyway, that is my COVID update.
[02:13.560 --> 02:18.800]  Also one thing I've noticed, my attention span is really, uh, it's, it is messed up.
[02:18.800 --> 02:19.800]  Something's fucked up.
[02:19.800 --> 02:21.920]  The vid messed up my attention span.
[02:21.920 --> 02:24.280]  So I apologize if I feel a little bit out of focus.
[02:24.280 --> 02:25.680]  I fucking am dude.
[02:25.680 --> 02:30.120]  I am also something I'm going to notice and mention after COVID.
[02:30.120 --> 02:31.120]  Dabs are wrecking me.
[02:31.120 --> 02:32.120]  Oh my goodness.
[02:32.120 --> 02:34.440]  I don't know if you guys take a little dab or a medium dab or a big dab.
[02:34.440 --> 02:37.440]  I feel so, so incredibly dabalicious.
[02:37.440 --> 02:38.440]  I'm getting lit from the dab.
[02:38.440 --> 02:40.040]  All right, I'm just rambling now.
[02:40.040 --> 02:43.280]  Let's get into the main part of this podcast here.
[02:43.280 --> 02:47.120]  I did say that I had some Patreon messages here in front of me.
[02:47.120 --> 02:50.040]  This one comes from our friend S.C.
[02:50.040 --> 02:53.360]  Dung Slinger and it goes a little bit like this.
[02:53.360 --> 02:59.280]  It says, hey buddy, could you send the Patreons an advanced text when you add drops to iRedirect?
[02:59.280 --> 03:03.280]  I listen to all of the podcasts and IG, but I don't do discord.
[03:03.280 --> 03:08.240]  When I found out about iRedirect and all that stuff, I would have enter, uh, let's see it.
[03:08.240 --> 03:11.040]  It's your, your autocorrect blasted you out here.
[03:11.040 --> 03:14.520]  Uh, it was already gone by the time you saw it was available.
[03:14.520 --> 03:16.440]  I'm not sure what autocorrect turned your sentence into.
[03:16.440 --> 03:19.280]  It doesn't make sense to me, but we'll not deal with that here on the show.
[03:19.280 --> 03:20.880]  Uh, it says, I know you have stuff.
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.080]  I know you don't have a staff like the dude grow show, but they send the Patreons a text
[03:25.080 --> 03:28.640]  every time they post anything to the DGC Patreons.
[03:28.880 --> 03:34.960]  Um, so what our friend here is talking about is I have added iRedirect.com to my lineup,
[03:34.960 --> 03:39.320]  iRegenetics.com in the middle of the webpage, there is a tab that says direct, or you can
[03:39.320 --> 03:42.200]  simply click or simply type in iRedirect.
[03:42.200 --> 03:43.280]  It will get you right there.
[03:43.400 --> 03:45.320]  That is where you can get iRegenetics.
[03:45.480 --> 03:48.720]  Uh, you can get the regular seeds, the feminized seeds, a lot of new stuff.
[03:48.960 --> 03:50.920]  A lot of older stuff is available there.
[03:51.560 --> 03:56.640]  So what my friend is asking for is for when I post new items on iRedirect is that I let
[03:56.640 --> 04:01.120]  the Patreon members know that there is new stuff up there so that they can get a jump
[04:01.120 --> 04:01.400]  on it.
[04:01.400 --> 04:02.480]  That is a great request.
[04:02.720 --> 04:03.800]  That's a great question.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.640]  Yes, I will do my best to start doing that.
[04:06.640 --> 04:08.000]  Like you said, I don't have a staff.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.160]  It's just me doing 99% of this work.
[04:11.160 --> 04:15.160]  I get some help here and there with some things I feel comfortable with, but honestly, I like
[04:15.160 --> 04:16.600]  to do most of it by myself.
[04:16.600 --> 04:18.200]  It lets me know it's getting done correctly.
[04:18.400 --> 04:19.920]  If there's a mistake, I blame it on me.
[04:19.920 --> 04:20.920]  I fix it quickly.
[04:21.160 --> 04:24.360]  Uh, things will happen, but I do most of it by myself.
[04:24.600 --> 04:30.840]  Also, I don't, uh, I don't advertise on the Patreon and the discord and as much as I could.
[04:30.840 --> 04:34.840]  I don't advertise online as much as I could because that's not really what I'm there for.
[04:34.840 --> 04:36.000]  People know that I exist.
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.640]  People know the company is established.
[04:37.640 --> 04:38.800]  The seeds are available.
[04:39.120 --> 04:42.880]  I'm on discord and Patreon to kind of hang out with the crew, to hang out with the people,
[04:42.880 --> 04:46.840]  part of the, uh, to be a part of the community, not there just to advertise.
[04:47.160 --> 04:48.640]  I do throw my advertising out.
[04:48.640 --> 04:50.280]  What kind of business would I be if I didn't?
[04:50.280 --> 04:53.080]  That's a big part of social media, a big part of why I'm there.
[04:53.080 --> 04:55.800]  But I try not to bombard you with like, Hey, buy seeds.
[04:55.800 --> 04:56.520]  Hey, buy seeds.
[04:56.520 --> 05:01.120]  You know, they're there, but I do appreciate the request that I let you know the seeds are there.
[05:01.120 --> 05:01.440]  Yes.
[05:01.440 --> 05:07.720]  I will let you know when I put new beans on the I read direct.com website.
[05:07.720 --> 05:12.640]  Also, uh, the patrons are going to get exclusives and discounts.
[05:12.640 --> 05:16.840]  I know that for a long time, you guys were asking for deals on seeds through Patreon.
[05:16.840 --> 05:20.160]  I can't do it directly through Patreon because Patreon doesn't agree with that.
[05:20.480 --> 05:25.320]  What I can do is I can give you coupon codes where you can go to my website or the beans are available.
[05:25.320 --> 05:27.080]  I can do the coupon codes.
[05:27.080 --> 05:28.120]  I can help you out there.
[05:28.280 --> 05:35.000]  So in the future, there will be exclude exclusives, and there will also be discount codes for the patron members.
[05:35.000 --> 05:42.000]  Also sign up for the mail chimp, because if you go to my website, there's a part on the bottom of the website that says sign up for the newsletter.
[05:42.280 --> 05:45.800]  If you sign up for that, you will also get notifications about fresh drops.
[05:45.800 --> 05:47.440]  You don't have to join the Patreon.
[05:47.880 --> 05:57.840]  The newsletter on mail chimp will help you out, but patron Patreon patrons are going to get exclusives, early drops, discounts, things like that.
[05:58.160 --> 06:03.520]  Um, I do plan on putting more stuff up on, I redirect, there's plenty of stuff up there right now.
[06:03.640 --> 06:04.760]  There's some great deals up there.
[06:04.760 --> 06:06.960]  I'm not going to talk about too much in here on the podcast.
[06:07.360 --> 06:09.040]  Um, there's some great stuff.
[06:09.040 --> 06:17.280]  I will be adding a lot of stuff right after the fish concerts in September, the start of September fish is playing four days.
[06:17.560 --> 06:22.120]  At Dick's, a soccer field in Denver, and I am going to all four nights.
[06:22.120 --> 06:24.200]  Then I will need a day or two to recover from that.
[06:24.520 --> 06:25.680]  Then we will load up.
[06:25.680 --> 06:28.920]  I redirect with brand new stuff for the month of September.
[06:28.920 --> 06:30.880]  The patrons will get a coupon code.
[06:31.120 --> 06:34.040]  There will be a mail chimp newsletter to let you know that it happened.
[06:34.360 --> 06:39.040]  A discord will get notified, but once again, the patrons will get a fat coupon code.
[06:39.200 --> 06:42.280]  It'll be tier based based on your level of contribution.
[06:42.520 --> 06:42.760]  All right.
[06:42.760 --> 06:43.720]  There is more to this.
[06:43.880 --> 06:45.800]  Uh, do I need to read this part on the show?
[06:45.800 --> 06:47.200]  No, this part is for me.
[06:47.480 --> 06:48.440]  Uh, that was personal.
[06:48.440 --> 06:48.880]  Thank you, bro.
[06:48.880 --> 06:51.720]  I did read this part, uh, where you gave me a huge compliment.
[06:51.720 --> 06:52.640]  I do appreciate that.
[06:52.640 --> 06:53.200]  Thank you.
[06:53.520 --> 07:03.360]  Uh, no matter how long I do this podcast, no matter how many people show me, love, give me respect, send me letters, the type of thing that you said, those compliments, that encouragement that always matters.
[07:03.360 --> 07:04.280]  That does go a long way.
[07:04.280 --> 07:05.320]  That feels the fire.
[07:05.440 --> 07:06.000]  So thank you.
[07:06.000 --> 07:07.240]  I do appreciate that.
[07:08.000 --> 07:08.280]  All right.
[07:08.480 --> 07:09.200]  I'm going to keep moving.
[07:09.200 --> 07:13.400]  I've got a couple of more messages here in front of me and I am already running out of air.
[07:13.400 --> 07:14.520]  I operate at a high pace.
[07:14.520 --> 07:16.560]  When I do this podcast, I go kind of quickly.
[07:16.800 --> 07:18.480]  Uh, somebody told me that it felt urgent.
[07:18.760 --> 07:23.760]  I just tried not to lose my train of thought is really what's going on, but I can't keep up my own pace.
[07:23.760 --> 07:24.840]  I don't have enough air.
[07:25.160 --> 07:26.960]  Uh, the, the vid got me, bro.
[07:26.960 --> 07:27.600]  I apologize.
[07:27.600 --> 07:28.560]  I'm not making excuses.
[07:28.560 --> 07:29.320]  I'm just letting you know.
[07:30.040 --> 07:32.560]  That's why I sound like I'm out of breath and I'm trying to get through the show.
[07:32.560 --> 07:32.800]  All right.
[07:34.240 --> 07:35.520]  Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[07:35.520 --> 07:36.640]  Not going to edit a lot of this.
[07:36.640 --> 07:40.840]  This message comes from, they don't even say their name, but I'm not going to say her name.
[07:40.840 --> 07:43.320]  Cause you didn't put your name on here.
[07:43.640 --> 07:45.480]  Uh, the message says, Hey Rasta Jeff.
[07:45.480 --> 07:46.000]  What's up, bro.
[07:46.000 --> 07:46.680]  Good to meet you.
[07:46.920 --> 07:49.200]  It says I live right near the beach.
[07:49.320 --> 07:51.760]  That sounds like a good time until we read the message.
[07:51.760 --> 07:55.480]  It says, I see that my early flowering plants were pollinated.
[07:55.480 --> 07:56.200]  That's a bummer.
[07:56.640 --> 07:59.120]  Um, maybe they were pollinated.
[07:59.120 --> 08:01.560]  I would go check it, squeeze it a little bit and see if there are seeds in there.
[08:01.560 --> 08:03.400]  Those could just be swollen bracts.
[08:03.400 --> 08:07.880]  A lot of people assume sometimes that a swollen bract is a pollinated plant.
[08:08.120 --> 08:09.200]  Uh, go give it a squeeze.
[08:09.200 --> 08:12.760]  That could be just a, uh, swollen cowlicks, a swollen bract up there.
[08:12.920 --> 08:13.640]  Go check it out.
[08:13.640 --> 08:14.880]  I could be completely wrong.
[08:14.880 --> 08:15.680]  I haven't seen your girl.
[08:15.680 --> 08:16.640]  I don't have any pictures.
[08:16.920 --> 08:17.920]  I'm hoping for the best.
[08:17.920 --> 08:18.360]  It goes on.
[08:18.360 --> 08:23.840]  It says, do you think it is a bad idea growing outside, living right near the
[08:23.840 --> 08:26.440]  beach or a tourist destination?
[08:26.440 --> 08:30.400]  So you live, uh, near the beach or a tourist destination.
[08:30.400 --> 08:36.160]  And you're saying, uh, anybody could pass a hemp farm on the way to said beach.
[08:36.160 --> 08:38.800]  And then you think that they're going to pass the hemp farm and then they're going
[08:38.800 --> 08:41.240]  to bring the pollen to your girl on accident as they travel.
[08:41.360 --> 08:45.640]  That is, um, less likely than my suspicion.
[08:45.840 --> 08:48.600]  My suspicion is that it is probably wind.
[08:48.600 --> 08:50.960]  There's probably somebody else growing in your area.
[08:50.960 --> 08:54.800]  You're not the only person who got the idea to grow some ganja this year.
[08:55.080 --> 08:58.760]  And there are, it was probably somebody else growing hemp or cannabis within a
[08:58.760 --> 09:03.160]  few miles of your cultivation site, hemp, uh, hemp and cannabis.
[09:03.160 --> 09:04.000]  It's the same pollen.
[09:04.240 --> 09:08.640]  Uh, pollen can travel for quite a distance in the wind and it can pollinate your
[09:08.640 --> 09:09.280]  plants.
[09:09.560 --> 09:11.640]  Uh, so it was probably wind.
[09:11.800 --> 09:16.680]  Somebody in your four or five mile radius probably has a male plant, whichever the
[09:16.680 --> 09:20.480]  wind it travels, wherever you are, uh, you could be in another country.
[09:20.480 --> 09:23.880]  It could be a different part of the world, but the wind is probably going this way.
[09:23.960 --> 09:25.800]  There's probably somebody with a male that way.
[09:25.960 --> 09:28.440]  And you're down this way and the pollen is just going that way.
[09:28.680 --> 09:33.320]  I don't suspect it's people going to a hemp farm and getting pollen on them and
[09:33.320 --> 09:34.800]  then passing through your neighborhood.
[09:35.080 --> 09:36.880]  That doesn't seem it's possible.
[09:37.160 --> 09:41.080]  Uh, it could be more likely it would be pollinators, birds, bees, things like
[09:41.080 --> 09:41.440]  that.
[09:41.760 --> 09:44.360]  Uh, and the wind is probably the number one culprit there.
[09:44.680 --> 09:49.280]  Um, or it could just be weird genetics or something went crazy and the grow also.
[09:49.280 --> 09:52.160]  But my assumption, I think I've talked enough about that one.
[09:52.280 --> 09:56.840]  I think there's a male plant within the four or five mile radius of your plant.
[09:57.080 --> 10:00.280]  And it's simply skeet skeetily deeded on your plan.
[10:00.280 --> 10:01.960]  I don't think that it was tourists.
[10:01.960 --> 10:02.720]  Let me answer the question.
[10:02.720 --> 10:03.960]  Cause there was a specific part.
[10:03.960 --> 10:06.000]  Do I think that it's risky?
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.600]  Let me dial that in and not just ramble past it.
[10:08.880 --> 10:11.360]  Do you think it's a bad idea growing outside, living near the beach?
[10:11.400 --> 10:14.640]  Uh, no, but you're going to have to, these are the kinds of things that we're going
[10:14.640 --> 10:19.320]  to have to deal with as the nation, the entire country is starting to legalize
[10:19.320 --> 10:19.720]  cannabis.
[10:19.720 --> 10:23.360]  There are way more states that have legal cannabis than illegal cannabis.
[10:24.040 --> 10:28.560]  This is a, an agricultural issue that, um, we're going to have to deal with when
[10:28.560 --> 10:32.600]  people are growing and their own personal grows and some, a lot of people out there
[10:32.600 --> 10:34.080]  don't know how to identify a male.
[10:34.080 --> 10:36.400]  A lot of people don't even think about identifying a male.
[10:36.800 --> 10:41.120]  Uh, some people don't do the way that I think it should be done in test to plant
[10:41.120 --> 10:42.400]  indoors and then grow it outdoors.
[10:42.400 --> 10:43.920]  They don't all have that opportunity.
[10:44.120 --> 10:47.800]  So there are going to be males outdoors, wherever people are cultivating males
[10:47.800 --> 10:48.480]  will happen.
[10:48.680 --> 10:53.360]  And this is going to happen in a cult, uh, in a, in an agriculture and let me try
[10:53.360 --> 10:53.760]  that again.
[10:53.760 --> 10:58.720]  I'm not even going to edit that in an agricultural environment, like in farmland,
[10:58.960 --> 11:02.600]  uh, back in the day before cannabis came about, I feel like they forgot about this
[11:02.640 --> 11:06.440]  when we started zoning for cannabis here in Colorado, they would make sure that
[11:06.440 --> 11:10.400]  certain crops or certain distances apart so that this guy can't pollinate this
[11:10.400 --> 11:11.000]  guy's crop.
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.120]  And this guy can't pollinate this guy's crop.
[11:13.440 --> 11:14.960]  They'd keep them so many miles apart.
[11:14.960 --> 11:17.200]  I think it was like 2.4 miles or one point.
[11:17.440 --> 11:20.280]  I obviously don't remember the exact number, but there was a distance.
[11:20.280 --> 11:23.520]  They would put farms apart where they couldn't cause problems for each other.
[11:23.880 --> 11:27.680]  It seems like we totally forgot that when it came to cannabis, a lot of new people
[11:27.680 --> 11:30.840]  out there, a lot of just home growers growing in the backyard.
[11:30.880 --> 11:33.120]  This is something we are going to have to deal with.
[11:33.360 --> 11:34.360]  So be ready for that.
[11:34.360 --> 11:35.120]  Be prepared.
[11:35.320 --> 11:37.480]  Also don't be that grower.
[11:37.480 --> 11:41.560]  I've done a full episode on making sure you don't put male plants outdoors.
[11:41.800 --> 11:42.000]  All right.
[11:42.000 --> 11:43.600]  I've got another message here in front of me.
[11:43.600 --> 11:46.320]  This one is kind of long.
[11:46.720 --> 11:47.680]  Let's go for it.
[11:47.960 --> 11:49.680]  This one says Rasta Jeff.
[11:49.960 --> 11:53.960]  What are some of your favorite integrated pest management management?
[11:53.960 --> 11:55.280]  This that's harder to say than it looks.
[11:55.280 --> 11:56.680]  Let me try to read it again.
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.040]  What are some of your favorite integrated pest management products and rotations?
[12:02.320 --> 12:06.480]  You did mention evergreen, but you didn't list any of your other favorites.
[12:06.840 --> 12:07.040]  All right.
[12:07.040 --> 12:08.160]  That's a really good question.
[12:08.160 --> 12:10.520]  What pesticide products do I like to use?
[12:10.880 --> 12:14.120]  Uh, I often work in commercial cultivation facilities.
[12:14.360 --> 12:15.840]  I've also got a personal grow.
[12:15.840 --> 12:18.360]  I'd also do a lot of consulting for friends and family.
[12:18.840 --> 12:24.200]  Most of what I'm going to talk about are products that are approved and regulated
[12:24.200 --> 12:29.400]  by the Colorado marijuana enforcement division and also the Colorado department
[12:29.400 --> 12:34.120]  of agriculture and also the Colorado department of public health and environment.
[12:34.400 --> 12:39.520]  I do not know the rules, the regulations, the laws, uh, the fine print where you
[12:39.520 --> 12:41.720]  are, I can only speak on my area.
[12:41.960 --> 12:46.320]  And honestly, I didn't read these rules change so rapidly and frequently here
[12:46.560 --> 12:49.840]  that some of the products on my list could have been banned since I
[12:49.840 --> 12:51.360]  blinked after I wrote this.
[12:51.360 --> 12:53.760]  I could have came from the computer sat here.
[12:53.880 --> 12:56.200]  They could have sent out an email saying, Hey, you can no longer
[12:56.200 --> 12:57.560]  use some of the stuff on your list.
[12:57.560 --> 12:59.680]  That's just how the industry goes right now.
[12:59.680 --> 13:00.480]  It's how it's going to be.
[13:00.480 --> 13:01.400]  We are evolving.
[13:01.600 --> 13:04.440]  We are adjusting and adapting when they find out there's a problem with the
[13:04.440 --> 13:07.760]  product, I'm happy to adjust, find a new product to use for that.
[13:07.760 --> 13:12.240]  So what I'm going to tell you is what I'd recommend for, uh, my personal
[13:12.240 --> 13:16.040]  facilities, my commercial facilities in the state of Colorado.
[13:16.520 --> 13:19.440]  You're going to have to make your own personal decisions when it comes to
[13:19.920 --> 13:23.840]  what level of toxicity do you want in your facility?
[13:24.480 --> 13:26.800]  A lot of people want to stay organic.
[13:26.800 --> 13:30.000]  A lot of people don't care if they're using nuclear war in their grow.
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.880]  Uh, it's all chemicals, no matter how organic you go, no matter how abrasive
[13:34.880 --> 13:37.600]  of a product you use, it is all chemicals.
[13:37.840 --> 13:41.000]  Uh, people like to stick with the buzzword organic, but then I remind
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.960]  them that cyanide is organic.
[13:42.960 --> 13:44.520]  Does that make it okay to you?
[13:44.520 --> 13:47.440]  And then they get flustered with me, but keep in mind that you're the one
[13:47.440 --> 13:49.560]  making the ethical decisions in this grow.
[13:49.560 --> 13:52.560]  So if you want to use something that may stick around in that plant, that
[13:52.560 --> 13:56.200]  could cause harm to somebody, don't share it, don't sell it, smoke it yourself.
[13:56.200 --> 13:59.520]  But if you're going to share stuff, use things that are more, uh, health
[13:59.520 --> 14:00.800]  conscious to your consumers.
[14:00.800 --> 14:05.040]  Also the big hippie in me is going to remind you to be conscious of the
[14:05.040 --> 14:07.080]  environment, don't destroy the earth.
[14:07.080 --> 14:08.120]  Don't destroy the planet.
[14:08.360 --> 14:11.800]  Uh, that small patch of land right there is yours right now, but everything
[14:11.800 --> 14:15.000]  around it is other people's the part above it, below it, other people.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.440]  And in a few years it will be somebody else's.
[14:17.680 --> 14:18.760]  So don't fuck that up.
[14:18.760 --> 14:22.240]  Now, my other rant when it comes to pesticides, uh, I am trained by the
[14:22.240 --> 14:24.080]  Colorado department of agriculture.
[14:24.400 --> 14:28.480]  Um, I was trained by a lovely lady named Theo Walker, took a nice long
[14:28.480 --> 14:30.240]  class, passed a really great test.
[14:30.600 --> 14:35.280]  And if I did not remind you guys to always wear your personal protective
[14:35.280 --> 14:39.200]  equipment when mixing and using a pesticide, I would be doing my friend
[14:39.200 --> 14:42.680]  Theo Walker a disservice and not honoring my education.
[14:42.680 --> 14:46.880]  So you guys out there, I'm, I have to say this as part of just who I am, my
[14:46.880 --> 14:49.160]  responsibility, my, my morals, my ethics.
[14:49.160 --> 14:52.800]  And I want you to be safe where the appropriate personal protective
[14:52.800 --> 14:55.880]  equipment, when you're applying a pesticide, when you're getting it off
[14:55.880 --> 14:59.400]  the shelf, have your eye protection and gloves on when you start mixing it up,
[14:59.600 --> 15:00.600]  have your long sleeves.
[15:00.600 --> 15:04.800]  And so on your pesticide container, um, if you grab the container, there's a
[15:04.800 --> 15:07.280]  little book that folds out inside that book.
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.760]  It will tell you the recommended, uh, clothing or personal protective
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.320]  equipment, the minimum personal protective equipment required for that
[15:15.320 --> 15:18.160]  pesticide, please wear that.
[15:18.840 --> 15:23.160]  Also inside of that booklet, you will find what is known as the re entry
[15:23.160 --> 15:23.800]  interval.
[15:23.800 --> 15:27.720]  What that means is from the time you spray it, this is how long you have got
[15:27.720 --> 15:30.040]  to wait before you can go back in that environment.
[15:30.040 --> 15:31.560]  They don't want you to get contaminated.
[15:31.800 --> 15:33.760]  Well, if you're spraying, you're creating air bubbles.
[15:33.760 --> 15:34.960]  There's a mist in the room.
[15:35.200 --> 15:38.160]  You don't want the misty part in your lungs and you don't want the wet, fresh
[15:38.160 --> 15:42.120]  pesticide off the plants on your skin and your eyes and your body.
[15:42.320 --> 15:43.520]  Now you're contaminated.
[15:43.520 --> 15:45.080]  Let's not do that to ourselves.
[15:45.280 --> 15:47.240]  Honor that re entry interval.
[15:47.400 --> 15:48.760]  Something I'm going to add.
[15:48.920 --> 15:52.800]  If you are in an indoor environment, which means your house inside your house,
[15:52.800 --> 15:58.240]  inside of a, uh, cultivation facility, uh, greenhouse may not be, uh, fall
[15:58.240 --> 15:59.080]  under this category.
[15:59.080 --> 16:03.560]  If you're an indoor enclosed environment or the sun is not getting into there, I
[16:03.560 --> 16:08.440]  recommend that you increase your re entry interval by a minimum of two hours.
[16:08.640 --> 16:10.160]  I would recommend four hours.
[16:10.160 --> 16:13.440]  My reason for this is I mentioned the sun a moment ago.
[16:13.680 --> 16:18.800]  Most of the time, the sun, the wind, the environment will break down a lot of the
[16:18.800 --> 16:20.800]  pesticides, which you have applied to the plants.
[16:20.800 --> 16:22.640]  Nature can happen better outside.
[16:22.880 --> 16:24.560]  We are in an indoor environment.
[16:24.560 --> 16:25.240]  There's no wind.
[16:25.240 --> 16:27.400]  We do have fans, but it's just moving it around the room.
[16:27.400 --> 16:29.360]  It's not traveling anywhere necessarily.
[16:29.680 --> 16:32.720]  Then we've got no sun in there to break down that pesticide.
[16:32.720 --> 16:34.240]  The light's not going to do the same thing.
[16:34.240 --> 16:35.680]  The sand, the sun is magic.
[16:35.960 --> 16:41.680]  So give yourself two to four more hours of re entry interval time before you enter
[16:41.680 --> 16:42.280]  that room.
[16:42.560 --> 16:47.600]  After applying a pesticide application, I recommend, uh, applying a pesticide
[16:47.800 --> 16:50.840]  right as the lights go out or right after the lights go, you can open it up and
[16:50.840 --> 16:51.720]  spray, spray them.
[16:51.720 --> 16:52.960]  You're not going to mess anything up.
[16:52.960 --> 16:55.640]  If you're just in there for one or two minutes, hit them with the pesticide
[16:55.640 --> 16:58.200]  spray, zip it back up, close it back up, whatever.
[16:58.320 --> 16:58.960]  Do it right.
[16:58.960 --> 17:02.240]  As the lights go out, then you've got at least eight, 12 hours before you're
[17:02.280 --> 17:03.400]  going to be in there again.
[17:03.480 --> 17:05.080]  So you've got plenty of time to dry up.
[17:05.080 --> 17:07.440]  Then when you go in there again, look at them, they should look super happy.
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.640]  Sometimes if I've applied an oily pesticide or something that is really
[17:11.640 --> 17:15.560]  abrasive, I will go in and just hose the plants down with just fresh water.
[17:15.560 --> 17:19.160]  I'll get my pump sprayer or my paint sprayer, whatever I'm doing, and just
[17:19.160 --> 17:23.200]  spray the plants down with clean pH balanced water just to wash off that
[17:23.200 --> 17:24.280]  extra pesticide.
[17:24.560 --> 17:26.120]  Uh, just give it a little bit of a rent.
[17:26.120 --> 17:29.600]  I'll turn off the lights, give it a spray, let them dry, turn the lights back
[17:29.600 --> 17:32.360]  on business as usual, keep rocking.
[17:32.360 --> 17:33.960]  So we talked about reentry interval.
[17:33.960 --> 17:35.280]  We talked about pesticide.
[17:35.280 --> 17:37.040]  We talked about your ethics.
[17:37.040 --> 17:40.640]  We talked about not sharing, uh, contaminated products with other people.
[17:40.640 --> 17:42.360]  Smoke, whatever you want, bro.
[17:42.560 --> 17:45.800]  If you're going to fucking smoke it by yourself, if it's not going anywhere,
[17:46.040 --> 17:48.160]  you can spray whatever you, I don't recommend it.
[17:48.160 --> 17:50.680]  It's not what I would do, but you can do whatever you want.
[17:50.920 --> 17:53.920]  If you've got to get rid of the bugs, just don't share that shit.
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  Uh, we make medical marijuana was our goal here.
[17:58.200 --> 18:00.480]  Not make other sick, make other people sick.
[18:00.480 --> 18:01.000]  Marijuana.
[18:01.000 --> 18:01.840]  Keep that in mind.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.400]  The people are already sick.
[18:03.400 --> 18:05.080]  They already have a compromised immune system.
[18:05.080 --> 18:08.160]  Possibly they could have cancer, they could have other conditions and you want
[18:08.160 --> 18:10.440]  to give them something to make them better, not sicker.
[18:10.720 --> 18:11.400]  That's your goal.
[18:11.400 --> 18:12.240]  Don't be that guy.
[18:12.240 --> 18:16.600]  Now let's actually talk about some of the pesticides that I will recommend.
[18:16.880 --> 18:22.040]  My strategy all depends on, um, the space, the environment, the room,
[18:22.200 --> 18:23.800]  the type, the time of the year.
[18:23.800 --> 18:26.560]  What am I going to be facing as a problem?
[18:26.560 --> 18:27.840]  As a, uh, a bug?
[18:27.840 --> 18:29.400]  What's my problem in this room?
[18:29.400 --> 18:30.680]  What am I trying to get rid of?
[18:31.200 --> 18:34.360]  Uh, we all know that most of the time we're trying to get rid of spider
[18:34.360 --> 18:37.720]  mites, thrips, fungus, gnats, white flies.
[18:38.040 --> 18:41.560]  Um, those are most and powdery mildew also is a very common thing that we're
[18:41.560 --> 18:45.720]  mostly trying to get rid of or keep away from our grow.
[18:45.960 --> 18:48.760]  I work in a lot of commercial environments, a lot of big spaces in
[18:48.760 --> 18:51.200]  Colorado where they get a lot of spider mites.
[18:51.200 --> 18:52.680]  It's like, they're just passing around the mites.
[18:52.680 --> 18:54.360]  It's the trim crews that are bringing them around.
[18:54.400 --> 18:57.760]  I suspect I can't prove it, but they're the only new people coming
[18:57.760 --> 19:00.760]  and going as the trim crew, bringing the spider mites, shout out to the trim crew.
[19:00.760 --> 19:04.240]  I still love you, but, um, we get a lot of mites here and we get a lot of powdery
[19:04.240 --> 19:06.160]  mildew, so I know how to beat that very well.
[19:06.320 --> 19:07.720]  A lot of people are getting Russet mites.
[19:07.720 --> 19:08.880]  I can destroy that.
[19:09.160 --> 19:11.960]  The fungus gnats, thrips, white flies, that's amateur hour.
[19:11.960 --> 19:13.120]  We can get rid of that shit.
[19:13.560 --> 19:17.560]  So I really treat to prevent spider mites, powdery mildew, things like that.
[19:17.560 --> 19:23.280]  The way that I do it is I like to have a, um, yellow sticky trap every,
[19:23.480 --> 19:25.520]  uh, three to six feet ish in the garden.
[19:25.520 --> 19:30.160]  So if I got those six foot by five foot trays, I usually put two to three sticky
[19:30.160 --> 19:32.560]  traps per tray down kind of low.
[19:32.760 --> 19:37.120]  Uh, we do a lot of lollipopping between the pot and the, uh, start of the plant
[19:37.120 --> 19:40.640]  is about 12 to 18 inches, depending on the strain and how long we fucking
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.160]  vegged, uh, in that area, I will hang yellow sticky traps that bugs love to go
[19:45.160 --> 19:48.680]  in that area that I may put some up higher also, but I definitely get down
[19:48.680 --> 19:49.560]  there by the legs.
[19:50.040 --> 19:55.400]  Those are not in any way designed to eradicate or remove or eliminate a bug.
[19:55.400 --> 19:58.840]  Those are there to indicate the presence of a pest.
[19:58.880 --> 20:02.440]  Those say, Hey dude, there's these black sticky things all over here.
[20:02.680 --> 20:03.240]  Count them.
[20:03.240 --> 20:04.400]  See how many there were.
[20:04.640 --> 20:07.960]  You saw them on the first break before you went to break, check on them before
[20:07.960 --> 20:09.840]  you go to lunch and check on them at third break.
[20:10.120 --> 20:12.680]  Then if we need to up our game, we know we've got bugs in there.
[20:12.680 --> 20:15.800]  So the yellow sticky traps are my first line of defense.
[20:15.880 --> 20:19.960]  My second line of defense is just myself and the Grotex looking.
[20:20.040 --> 20:24.160]  Just use your eyes when you're in there watering, defoliating, popping, twisting,
[20:24.400 --> 20:25.960]  taking out the trash, whatever you're doing.
[20:25.960 --> 20:27.400]  Just look at the plants occasionally.
[20:27.400 --> 20:29.520]  Do you see signs of spider mites?
[20:29.520 --> 20:30.640]  Do you see thrift damage?
[20:30.640 --> 20:33.120]  Do you see anything that indicates, Hey, there are bugs.
[20:33.480 --> 20:36.680]  So the first way to get rid of and prevent them is just to scout for them
[20:36.840 --> 20:38.960]  and have some sort of alarm system.
[20:38.960 --> 20:40.040]  Those yellow sticky traps.
[20:40.040 --> 20:41.720]  Let me know that they are there.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.760]  Now let's talk about, um, what I like to apply.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.120]  What I like to do is I generally apply pesticides on a Monday.
[20:50.120 --> 20:52.080]  It's just something that's easy to keep in mind.
[20:52.280 --> 20:54.520]  Every Monday we do apply a pesticide.
[20:55.120 --> 20:58.120]  If I know that the season is coming where the mites are going to get strong or the
[20:58.120 --> 21:02.720]  fungus gnats get real strong, or if another facility has bugs or something like that,
[21:02.720 --> 21:07.240]  then I will increase the Monday and Thursday, depending on which bugs I'm
[21:07.240 --> 21:11.680]  facing, uh, if I'm doing a preventative or if I'm doing an eradication spray, or
[21:11.680 --> 21:16.200]  if I'm doing a holy fuck spray that tells me which products I'm going to use.
[21:16.200 --> 21:17.160]  I do rotate.
[21:17.560 --> 21:19.240]  Uh, I do like to rotate the products.
[21:19.240 --> 21:21.960]  I will use two or three products together at one time.
[21:21.960 --> 21:25.880]  Also I'll mix them in this pump sprayer and I'll spray two or three products at a
[21:25.880 --> 21:26.440]  time.
[21:26.840 --> 21:27.960]  Uh, make sure you rotate.
[21:27.960 --> 21:29.880]  That's a very important thing is to rotate.
[21:29.880 --> 21:34.600]  If you hit them with one product today and the same product tomorrow, by day three,
[21:34.880 --> 21:35.720]  they're ready for it.
[21:35.720 --> 21:36.800]  It's not going to even matter.
[21:36.800 --> 21:37.960]  They're just going to get stronger.
[21:37.960 --> 21:39.240]  You're going to make super mites.
[21:39.480 --> 21:41.320]  So I recommend to rotate a product.
[21:41.320 --> 21:45.680]  If you can afford one, two, maybe three good products, spray two products on day
[21:45.680 --> 21:48.320]  one and hit them with a third products on the next spray.
[21:48.560 --> 21:51.440]  And then two different products, two different combos on the next time.
[21:51.440 --> 21:55.080]  Just keep switching it up somehow to where they got a new way to try to figure it
[21:55.080 --> 21:55.760]  out.
[21:55.760 --> 21:57.920]  Understand the mode of attack.
[21:57.920 --> 22:00.400]  How does this product work on the bug I am treating?
[22:00.400 --> 22:03.960]  Also, the first thing is identify the pest, which you're trying to get rid of.
[22:04.200 --> 22:05.040]  What are you trying to fight?
[22:05.040 --> 22:08.080]  If you don't even know that you'll never win, identify the bug.
[22:08.320 --> 22:11.520]  Then think about multiple methods of how to destroy that bug.
[22:11.520 --> 22:13.760]  First of all, make an undesirable environment.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.840]  If they don't like being there, if the leaves are sticky, if the leaves are wet,
[22:16.840 --> 22:19.040]  if the leaves are oily, they don't want to be around.
[22:19.080 --> 22:20.840]  Then attack them a couple of ways.
[22:21.080 --> 22:23.480]  Some of these products make them forget to eat.
[22:23.640 --> 22:26.560]  The bugs just walk around and they're like, I should be doing something.
[22:27.120 --> 22:27.960]  They don't eat.
[22:28.080 --> 22:28.920]  They die.
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.040]  Some of these products make a mushroom grow out this little,
[22:32.080 --> 22:35.040]  they eat this little bacteria and it goes inside of the mushroom or inside of
[22:35.040 --> 22:38.000]  the bug and it grows out of them and makes a giant mushroom and they die.
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.440]  And then the mushrooms decompose.
[22:39.680 --> 22:42.120]  It's kind of cool to see the little pictures and videos of that happening,
[22:42.360 --> 22:45.080]  but understand the, uh, the methods and mode of attack.
[22:45.080 --> 22:47.280]  Some just stop them from being able to reproduce.
[22:47.480 --> 22:48.080]  So that's cool.
[22:48.080 --> 22:48.400]  You got them.
[22:48.400 --> 22:50.040]  They can't eat, they can't reproduce.
[22:50.040 --> 22:52.920]  And now we're blowing them up with mushrooms and we made it sticky.
[22:53.200 --> 22:55.240]  Think about multiple modes of attack.
[22:55.400 --> 22:58.760]  And then also think about not letting them build resistance.
[22:58.760 --> 23:03.040]  Now we're going to kind of just focus in on a list of products that I wrote down.
[23:03.320 --> 23:04.680]  Uh, identify your bug.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.360]  Uh, I didn't understand the pesticides you're using and apply with purpose
[23:08.360 --> 23:10.400]  and rotate your pesticide.
[23:10.800 --> 23:14.640]  Now, um, let's just talk about some of the products that I wrote down.
[23:14.840 --> 23:16.640]  I like a product called the pyganic.
[23:16.640 --> 23:18.080]  I also like evergreen.
[23:18.320 --> 23:21.800]  Those are both pyrethrin based, uh, very similar products, but very
[23:21.800 --> 23:23.560]  different application rates.
[23:24.120 --> 23:28.000]  I like as a max and as a trawl, I think as a max is banned in the commercial
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.440]  facility, excuse me for the burps.
[23:30.440 --> 23:33.280]  I also do like a product called venerate.
[23:33.280 --> 23:35.000]  Venerate is a very strong product.
[23:35.240 --> 23:36.560]  Be careful with that one.
[23:36.800 --> 23:38.160]  I like Botanigard Max.
[23:38.160 --> 23:39.680]  Let me tell you what I use these for.
[23:39.720 --> 23:43.320]  Let me back up, uh, pyganic evergreen as a troll venerate.
[23:43.320 --> 23:47.360]  Those are good for almost everything, but especially spider mites, uh,
[23:47.400 --> 23:51.960]  Botanigard Max, I will use the Botanigard Max as a spray for fighter spider mites,
[23:52.280 --> 23:56.560]  uh, fungus gnats, and then I will use it as a soil dredge for
[23:56.640 --> 23:58.360]  fungus gnats or white flies.
[23:58.600 --> 24:02.320]  Also the pyganic and evergreen, those make a great soil dredge as well
[24:02.400 --> 24:04.400]  for fungus gnats and white flies.
[24:04.640 --> 24:06.080]  When you're treating for white flies.
[24:06.760 --> 24:11.400]  I recommend you do a soil dredge and a spray application at the same time.
[24:11.680 --> 24:14.920]  Cause if you spray one and don't do the other, uh, they just move, they'd
[24:14.920 --> 24:15.960]  go hang out in the other spot.
[24:15.960 --> 24:17.040]  They go, you fucked up the soil.
[24:17.040 --> 24:17.800]  We'll go to the leaves.
[24:17.800 --> 24:19.240]  You spray the leaves, they go to the soil.
[24:19.560 --> 24:23.000]  You got to do both when you're messing with the white flies for white flies.
[24:23.280 --> 24:26.280]  I recommend Monterey garden spray with spinosad.
[24:26.280 --> 24:30.560]  Spinosad is a bacteria made in the bottom of a whiskey barrel, and it will
[24:30.560 --> 24:33.080]  work very well on your white flies.
[24:33.400 --> 24:35.560]  I also like a product called cease.
[24:35.560 --> 24:36.800]  Cease is a good product.
[24:37.120 --> 24:38.640]  I like smite and banish.
[24:38.640 --> 24:43.680]  However, if you use smite and or banish rinse your plants off
[24:43.680 --> 24:45.520]  before the lights come back on.
[24:45.520 --> 24:48.720]  Those products will cause photo toxicity.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.280]  Um, I also like a product called regalia.
[24:51.280 --> 24:54.120]  That's good to keep away the powdery mildew and a lot of pests.
[24:54.440 --> 24:56.960]  And an outdoor grow, I would use a lot of regalia.
[24:57.240 --> 25:00.600]  I also like double nickel, uh, anything with spinosad.
[25:00.880 --> 25:02.520]  Uh, grandivo is a great product.
[25:02.840 --> 25:06.120]  Triact 70 is like one of my last lines of defense.
[25:06.120 --> 25:08.720]  If everything else didn't do it, we'll mix in some triac.
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.040]  There are other products that are more abrasive, more aggressive.
[25:12.320 --> 25:14.400]  I'm not going to talk about them here today.
[25:14.560 --> 25:15.880]  I don't want you to use them.
[25:15.880 --> 25:19.160]  If you want to do your thing, it's your grow.
[25:19.440 --> 25:22.120]  It's your ethics, but I would not recommend it.
[25:22.360 --> 25:23.560]  Another great product.
[25:23.560 --> 25:28.240]  If you've got soil bound problems like white flies, fungus gnats, and
[25:28.240 --> 25:33.880]  you want to drench that soil, something that works really good is mosquito bits.
[25:34.120 --> 25:37.600]  Uh, it like your local hardware shop, maybe target, definitely
[25:37.600 --> 25:41.320]  home Depot and Lowe's they sell things called mosquito dunks.
[25:41.520 --> 25:44.000]  They look like little, it's a red package with yellow writing.
[25:44.200 --> 25:46.320]  They look like little shitty donuts in a package.
[25:46.320 --> 25:48.960]  There are six of them, small, six shitty donuts.
[25:49.240 --> 25:52.560]  I will take one of those and crush it up into like a very fine dust.
[25:52.800 --> 25:56.880]  And then put that in my reservoir with my water and water the plants with that.
[25:56.880 --> 25:58.560]  You may see some of the chunks floating around.
[25:58.560 --> 25:59.400]  That's just fine.
[25:59.880 --> 26:04.280]  Inside of those mosquito bits is a beneficial bacteria beneficial to the
[26:04.280 --> 26:07.840]  plants, not so beneficial to the fungus gnats and white flies.
[26:07.840 --> 26:08.720]  It'll wipe them out.
[26:08.960 --> 26:12.680]  So give them a soil dredge with fung, uh, with the, uh, fungus now, what
[26:12.680 --> 26:14.320]  does it call the mosquito dunks in there?
[26:14.520 --> 26:18.080]  And that will help wipe out soil born pests and they're
[26:18.080 --> 26:19.240]  super cheap and affordable.
[26:19.240 --> 26:21.320]  Those products are really cheap and readily available.
[26:21.600 --> 26:23.480]  You can get that at your local hardware shop.
[26:23.480 --> 26:27.680]  Hopefully if not Lowe's and home Depot, we'll have it over there in the garden.
[26:28.800 --> 26:29.080]  All right.
[26:29.080 --> 26:30.080]  So I was losing my breath.
[26:30.080 --> 26:31.120]  I tried to go fast.
[26:31.360 --> 26:33.160]  I got my shit back together really quickly.
[26:33.160 --> 26:34.120]  I'll go through the list.
[26:34.400 --> 26:40.640]  Pyganic evergreen as a trawl, venerate botanic guard, max cease, smite,
[26:40.640 --> 26:44.240]  banish regalia, double nickel Monterey garden spray.
[26:44.240 --> 26:46.120]  Let me add tangle foot to that mix.
[26:46.360 --> 26:49.720]  You can get Monterey garden spray and tangle foot, both it
[26:49.720 --> 26:51.320]  like your big box hardware store.
[26:51.320 --> 26:55.080]  So if you're limited on resources and places to shop, tangle foot,
[26:55.280 --> 26:59.560]  a Monterey garden spray, those will both be available at your local garden center.
[26:59.880 --> 27:05.240]  Uh, you can also use grand Devo and triac 70 and sometimes don't tell
[27:05.240 --> 27:08.440]  anybody that I said this, but granulated sulfur is a great product
[27:08.440 --> 27:11.400]  for getting rid of a lot of pests.
[27:12.360 --> 27:14.560]  Now that I've told you products that I do use, let me tell
[27:14.560 --> 27:16.400]  you something that I do not use.
[27:16.640 --> 27:18.600]  I do not recommend neem oil.
[27:18.600 --> 27:20.120]  I don't like neem oil in the garden.
[27:20.120 --> 27:20.960]  It tastes like shit.
[27:20.960 --> 27:21.920]  It doesn't go away.
[27:22.200 --> 27:23.720]  It makes the plants taste terrible.
[27:23.880 --> 27:28.040]  And I also don't like to use botanical oils like hippie oil sprays,
[27:28.240 --> 27:30.320]  rosemary, oregano oil, all that stuff.
[27:30.320 --> 27:31.640]  I don't do that in the garden.
[27:31.640 --> 27:32.200]  Why not?
[27:32.480 --> 27:35.560]  Because a lot of the stuff that we grow turns into concentrates.
[27:35.560 --> 27:36.680]  We make hash out of it.
[27:36.880 --> 27:39.880]  And you can see when you're making a concentrate, you can see those
[27:39.880 --> 27:41.880]  oily pesticides float to the top.
[27:42.080 --> 27:44.640]  I did just tell you a bunch of stuff to spray on the plant.
[27:44.640 --> 27:48.200]  That's going to make them sticky, but you're going to apply it way early.
[27:48.200 --> 27:50.800]  They're going to last long enough to where you don't have to apply it again.
[27:50.840 --> 27:51.640]  They will be gone.
[27:51.640 --> 27:55.680]  They'll be broken down, evaporated, dissipated, and gone away from the plant
[27:55.880 --> 28:00.280]  before it is harvest time, dry cure smoke, that shit will all be gone by then.
[28:00.560 --> 28:03.480]  But those hippie botanical oils, they just leave that flavor.
[28:03.480 --> 28:04.640]  I can taste the mint.
[28:04.880 --> 28:07.640]  I can taste weird shit and the concentrates and the flowers.
[28:07.880 --> 28:10.000]  I can taste it when I get certain products.
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.920]  So I don't recommend that sort of stuff.
[28:11.920 --> 28:13.160]  No botanical oils.
[28:13.480 --> 28:17.760]  Uh, none of that, uh, neem oil stick with Rio and my, this is my opinion.
[28:17.920 --> 28:23.200]  My recommendation stick with the real, uh, agriculturally recommended pesticide
[28:23.240 --> 28:27.320]  application if you want to really strategically get rid of your pests.
[28:27.320 --> 28:29.760]  If you guys want to use the hippie oils, do that.
[28:29.760 --> 28:34.880]  Also something I do really like another, uh, completely flipped option, a whole
[28:34.880 --> 28:39.600]  B side to using all these pesticides is why not use some sort of predator mites?
[28:39.600 --> 28:43.160]  You can release Swarovski's hypoaspis miles, persimilis,
[28:43.160 --> 28:44.720]  cucumaris, green lace wings.
[28:44.720 --> 28:46.120]  I know I went really fast on that.
[28:46.480 --> 28:51.080]  Uh, but Rove beetles, all those guys will really, really help you out, uh, in
[28:51.080 --> 28:55.080]  your garden, uh, and they are harmless that way you don't have to smoke oils.
[28:55.360 --> 28:56.800]  Uh, that way you don't have to spray things.
[28:56.800 --> 28:58.200]  You do have to disperse the bugs.
[28:58.400 --> 29:00.360]  If you're growing in your home, a lot of people don't like that.
[29:00.360 --> 29:05.280]  But for a commercial grow, I greatly highly recommend aggressive predator
[29:05.440 --> 29:12.360]  bugs once again, Swarovski's persimilis, hypoaspis miles, Rove beetles, cucumaris.
[29:12.480 --> 29:14.000]  Um, what else did I say?
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.520]  Green lace wings, get, get the green lace wings that are on the cards
[29:17.520 --> 29:19.080]  and they are just about to hatch.
[29:19.080 --> 29:22.000]  They turn into little fucking alligators and those things will
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.680]  eat all of the bugs in your grow.
[29:24.680 --> 29:28.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is my rant on which pesticides I would use.
[29:28.400 --> 29:30.640]  I think I stretched that one out quite a while.
[29:31.040 --> 29:33.720]  Thank you guys for putting up with my, uh, my terrible voice, my
[29:33.720 --> 29:35.440]  wheezing, my lack of oxygen.
[29:35.440 --> 29:36.480]  I do appreciate it.
[29:36.680 --> 29:39.200]  I'm trying to get it back together, trying to get everything going.
[29:39.480 --> 29:40.040]  Give me time.
[29:40.040 --> 29:40.880]  That's all it takes.
[29:41.120 --> 29:43.760]  They just say, get a lot of rest and hydrate.
[29:43.960 --> 29:44.520]  I'm trying, bro.
[29:44.520 --> 29:46.400]  I'm trying, but I got a lot of shit to do also.
[29:46.520 --> 29:48.160]  I'll do my best to keep the shoves coming.
[29:48.400 --> 29:50.080]  Uh, thank you for all of the support.
[29:50.200 --> 29:52.720]  Make sure you guys check out iredirect.com.
[29:52.720 --> 29:53.120]  That's right.
[29:53.120 --> 29:55.280]  Iredirect.com for fresh drops.
