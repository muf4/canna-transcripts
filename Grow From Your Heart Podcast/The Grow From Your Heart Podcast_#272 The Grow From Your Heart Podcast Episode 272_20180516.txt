[00:15.420 --> 00:20.460]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 272 of the Grow From
[00:20.460 --> 00:24.860]  Your Heart podcast. You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:24.860 --> 00:28.740]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:28.740 --> 00:33.060]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious
[00:33.060 --> 00:38.300]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:38.300 --> 00:42.020]  host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As
[00:42.020 --> 00:45.500]  always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:45.500 --> 00:50.140]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
[00:50.140 --> 00:57.260]  Mystic Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, excuse the coffee, crunchy, shitty sound and voice.
[00:57.260 --> 01:00.940]  I've had a little bit of a cold for the past week and I apologize. It's coming through
[01:00.940 --> 01:04.820]  on the microphone. A couple of people mentioned they could hear it in last week's episode.
[01:04.820 --> 01:08.460]  I apologize for sounding like shit, you guys, but the show must go on. As a professional
[01:08.460 --> 01:12.460]  podcaster, I will put out a show. Joining me this evening to make sure this show doesn't
[01:12.460 --> 01:15.460]  sound completely terrible is White Mike. Welcome back to the show, brother.
[01:15.460 --> 01:17.860]  Thanks, man. What's up, everybody?
[01:17.860 --> 01:20.060]  Thanks for covering for me, dude, while I cough a little bit over here.
[01:20.060 --> 01:21.060]  Yeah, man.
[01:21.060 --> 01:25.060]  So, you guys, this episode is coming out on Christmas. So if you're doing Christmas, Merry
[01:25.060 --> 01:26.060]  Christmas if you're listening.
[01:26.060 --> 01:27.060]  Merry Christmas, everybody.
[01:27.060 --> 01:32.260]  After Christmas, I hope you had a good Christmas. This isn't going to be a super intensive episode.
[01:32.260 --> 01:35.280]  You probably won't need a notebook. You're not going to want to take a whole lot of notes
[01:35.280 --> 01:38.800]  on this episode. It's Christmas. I don't know how many people are going to listen to
[01:38.800 --> 01:43.400]  a Christmas episode. This one may just get lost in the mix. Mike and I are going to hang
[01:43.400 --> 01:45.400]  out, take some dabs and talk about a few things.
[01:45.400 --> 01:46.400]  It's okay if you lose one or two.
[01:46.400 --> 01:51.320]  Yes, yes. We're going to take a little Christmas vacation also while we're on the podcast here
[01:51.320 --> 01:55.400]  and hang out, take some dabs. I like to start off the show most of the time by sharing what
[01:55.400 --> 02:02.120]  we've been dabbing on. I started dabbing this episode on Pura Vida high cannabinoid full
[02:02.120 --> 02:07.760]  spectrum extract with a little bit of clementine batter. I couldn't get the Pura Vida to stick
[02:07.760 --> 02:10.640]  to the dabber, so I just put enough of the clementine batter.
[02:10.640 --> 02:13.040]  Make a good base, a nice mortar.
[02:13.040 --> 02:16.240]  Yes, it's stuck on there real well and I just stick those little crystals into there and
[02:16.240 --> 02:19.400]  then it gives me a nice little dab. Of course, I had some of the clementine left over because
[02:19.400 --> 02:24.520]  it was Miss JB's birthday. Happy late birthday, Miss JB, if you listen to this. She had a
[02:24.520 --> 02:28.840]  little birthday party at the Studio 64 and I got her some clementine to smoke. She took
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.840]  a big old fat dab of that. She took a giant dab of some, I don't remember the strain,
[02:33.840 --> 02:38.240]  but she had a giant crystal, a giant HCFSE crystal. Had to be at least half a gram and
[02:38.240 --> 02:42.880]  she took the whole dab. She didn't choke very much. She got high as shit. She melted into
[02:42.880 --> 02:47.960]  the couch. She had a great birthday. Since I'm talking about JB's birthday, happy birthday.
[02:47.960 --> 02:51.560]  Also, big shout out to all the bearded men and their wives that joined us for the birthday
[02:51.560 --> 02:55.480]  party. I looked around at the party and every dude there had a killer beard. Shout out,
[02:55.480 --> 02:59.520]  man. Thanks for joining us. Everybody that came to the party, that was a good time. I'm
[02:59.520 --> 03:04.080]  going to turn down that music. It's making my brain go too fast. Um, yeah, so it's been
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.800]  a long week. Holy crap. Yeah, it's been a long couple of weeks, buddy. It has been a
[03:08.800 --> 03:12.560]  long year. We're wrapping up the year. There's only going to, this may be the last, is this
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.160]  the last podcast of the year that the people will hear? This is it. Probably. The next
[03:16.160 --> 03:23.520]  one will be in 2018. Oh, the future, the future, the future, the future. So yeah, it's been
[03:23.520 --> 03:29.120]  a long week. I fucking Monday. I didn't even go to work. I felt so shitty Monday. Yeah.
[03:29.120 --> 03:33.320]  Everybody was sick. It was a skeleton crew for the first half of the week. Yeah. Take
[03:33.320 --> 03:37.840]  your vitamins. You guys, if you're working with a big group of people, take your vitamins
[03:37.840 --> 03:42.760]  because it's winter time and everyone's getting sick. There's like three different nasty colds
[03:42.760 --> 03:48.160]  going around our area and it's not fun to be alive right now. Yeah. Well, you know,
[03:48.160 --> 03:51.080]  you've got to just dodge a lot of germ engine Pueblo right now. You've got to wash your
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.360]  hands. You got to drink a lot of water. Uh, you got to take some vitamins. You got to
[03:54.360 --> 03:58.000]  take the emergency or whatever you choose to do. The other night I straight looked like
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.240]  skeletal or all my skin was all dry and wrinkly and cracky from the freaking weather and your
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.240]  nose as well. Yep. Yeah. Everybody's got a runny nose around here. Take care of yourselves.
[04:06.240 --> 04:10.040]  You guys, that's what I'm saying. If you're in a cold place, take care of yourself. Vitamins
[04:10.040 --> 04:13.640]  people. Yeah. Tuesday I went to work, but then all the work crew was like, you look
[04:13.640 --> 04:17.760]  like a fucking zombie. Go home. So I came and slept all the Tuesday and then Wednesday
[04:17.760 --> 04:21.880]  I went to work and was half ass Thursday. I was mostly there and today, uh, today was
[04:21.880 --> 04:25.600]  management day where all the management comes and you do that shit. So it was meetings like
[04:25.600 --> 04:28.600]  a mother. Yeah. There wasn't much physical shit. So it was kind of chilled out. So I
[04:28.600 --> 04:31.800]  just got to walk around and talk and fucking do all that management shit today. So that's
[04:31.800 --> 04:36.880]  where it is. So a lot of strategery that did happen. A lot of shit got managed today. A
[04:36.880 --> 04:40.440]  lot of things did get managed. Shout out to our, uh, our buddy. He doesn't want to be
[04:40.440 --> 04:44.040]  named. I'm pretty sure, but the guy that comes to us, shout out to that dude for coming and
[04:44.040 --> 04:49.320]  helping us out today. Um, what else do we want to talk about? We covered JB's birthday.
[04:49.320 --> 04:52.440]  Happy birthday again, miss JB, big shout out to all the people that joined me for the birthday
[04:52.440 --> 04:56.920]  party. Uh, shout out to our friend bacon that drove down from Denver. Denver doesn't consume
[04:56.920 --> 05:00.840]  our bacon does not consume cannabis. And he came to a cannabis social club to hang out
[05:00.840 --> 05:05.640]  with a bunch of potheads on miss JB's birthday. So that was cool. Uh, shout out to bacon.
[05:05.640 --> 05:12.760]  I am excited. I talked about this. Uh, I talked about it on Instagram live this week, perhaps
[05:12.760 --> 05:19.240]  later this evening is pollen time. They're ready. I'm pretty sure they're ready. I was
[05:19.240 --> 05:23.240]  looking at them last night, three days ago. You were like, they're probably ready. I should
[05:23.240 --> 05:27.800]  wait a day. Yeah. And I'm way impressed. You've made it to Friday. Yeah. Well, it's Friday. It's
[05:27.800 --> 05:31.640]  so much easier for me to clean up on a Friday. I don't have as much a time constraint before I go
[05:31.640 --> 05:36.040]  to another garden that I could destroy someone who works in the same commercial facility as you do.
[05:36.040 --> 05:42.120]  I appreciate you waiting. Yes. Tonight may be the night that, uh, the pollen gets chucked. I've got
[05:42.120 --> 05:47.240]  two clones of the same male. They're dropping pollen really heavily. And there's, um, I'm
[05:47.240 --> 05:50.520]  excited about the Durban poison and star dog to tell you the truth. They're going to get
[05:50.520 --> 05:54.600]  pollinated. That's going to be really neat. I don't have any idea of what it's going to be
[05:54.600 --> 05:58.360]  called. I have ideas of what I think it's going to smell like. I know what some of the phenotypes
[05:58.360 --> 06:03.160]  I'm hoping for are going to smell like. I'm hoping to bring back some of that old land race Durban
[06:03.160 --> 06:08.360]  with some of those giant colas, but I don't want shit that takes like 14 weeks to finish.
[06:08.360 --> 06:14.120]  So I'm hoping I've got some like 10 week donkey dick, uh, anise licorice scented,
[06:14.120 --> 06:19.800]  tricone laden funk going on out of that crosses Michael with any luck. It'll happen. It will
[06:19.800 --> 06:23.800]  happen. There's a couple of things I already know. I'm really looking forward to about next year.
[06:23.800 --> 06:28.760]  And that's on the list. Uh, there's a star dog in there and star dog is a great commercial grower.
[06:28.760 --> 06:35.640]  She grows big, fat, dense colas. She smells really well, but there's something missing from the high.
[06:35.640 --> 06:38.920]  And I think putting that arise resin on it, we'll fix that.
[06:39.960 --> 06:42.920]  I'm looking forward to trying it. It's going to be a fun next year.
[06:43.880 --> 06:48.520]  And then something that, uh, smells really amazing in that room. The smell is overwhelming. The room
[06:48.520 --> 06:54.600]  right now is, uh, the platinum tangy. She's got a farm that'll fill up the whole building. It
[06:54.600 --> 06:58.200]  smells so good in that room just because of the platinum tangy. There's a cactus cooler and they're
[06:58.200 --> 07:01.720]  also, which usually stinks up the room, but right now it's the platinum tangy doing it.
[07:01.960 --> 07:08.120]  Tangy's just, I mean, just that citrus kind of, it's almost like a citrus and a body odor funk
[07:08.120 --> 07:13.960]  just for days. I'm thinking about that is why I paused. I was a citrus and body odor.
[07:14.760 --> 07:22.920]  That's it's a, I've called it when the extra, when you smoke, uh, tangy dabs or even Clementine dabs
[07:22.920 --> 07:27.720]  too hot. I think it tastes like orange chicken or garlic chicken. That's what it smells like to me,
[07:27.720 --> 07:31.640]  like garlic, like tofu, garlic, orange tofu, but it would be orange chicken from back in the day.
[07:31.640 --> 07:36.440]  I haven't had chicken in fucking years, but it smells like orange chicken or garlic.
[07:36.440 --> 07:44.680]  If you remember orange chicken from 1997. Yes. Circa circa 90. Yes. Uh, but yeah. So Paul,
[07:44.680 --> 07:51.800]  in this week, which means in the future there will be new crosses for people to try. And then
[07:51.800 --> 07:57.560]  there will be replenishings of things that are unavailable currently at the hell a dank seed bank.
[07:58.280 --> 08:01.160]  Yeah. Also a big shout. It's my friends at the hell a dank seed bank. I should have mentioned
[08:01.160 --> 08:05.480]  them at the top of the show. Uh, well that kind of show folks, well, they're, they're just friends
[08:05.480 --> 08:08.200]  of mine. And you know, since we're talking about seeds, we'll talk about the hell of dank seed
[08:08.200 --> 08:12.520]  bank. If you're looking to add something new to your garden, uh, I would recommend visiting,
[08:12.520 --> 08:17.080]  you know, the traditional new year's gift is seeds. If I'm not mistaken, that might be it.
[08:17.080 --> 08:22.120]  I'm pretty sure that's the new thing. Dank seed.store for all your iri genetics needs.
[08:22.120 --> 08:26.520]  They're also, uh, do it. They carry other, other brands there as well, but check that out.
[08:27.320 --> 08:33.240]  Um, what else should we hit on before, uh, before we start a ramble fest here?
[08:33.240 --> 08:38.600]  Oh, pretty sure. Ramble fest is already in at least third gear, but I'm just getting started.
[08:38.600 --> 08:42.920]  Would you owe hashtag? They like it when we ramble something we did not mention yet.
[08:42.920 --> 08:48.360]  Um, I always shout out to some friends of ours. What's up friends. There's all of our friends,
[08:48.360 --> 08:52.440]  fucking everybody. Shout out to all of our friends. If you've ever met, seen, heard of,
[08:52.440 --> 08:56.120]  read about, I'm only shouting out to people that have gotten a high five or better.
[08:57.640 --> 09:02.680]  I'm just going to extend it. I'm going to go. If a butterfly landed on me and then landed on you,
[09:02.680 --> 09:07.000]  if you read road on the same subway car as me, if you've been in the same taxi as me, whatever,
[09:07.000 --> 09:13.080]  what's up. Shout out. This got weird quickly. No, what I was going to say though. Um, there is
[09:13.080 --> 09:17.880]  another podcast all about cannabis. A lot of people say Ross to Jeff, you've got the best cannabis
[09:17.880 --> 09:21.640]  show. I appreciate that. Uh, you can tell me that that's fucking awesome. I love it. That it's your
[09:21.640 --> 09:26.280]  favorite. I feel like there's no competition when it comes to cannabis podcasts because we're all,
[09:26.280 --> 09:31.400]  as long as we're not coming on and being like, I shot up 17 marijuanas and I'm seeing the devil.
[09:31.400 --> 09:35.240]  I'm going to rape white bitches. As long as you come on and you talk about cannabis in a positive
[09:35.240 --> 09:38.600]  way, we're all friends. I want to support all the cannabis podcasts. There's a reason the word
[09:38.600 --> 09:42.520]  favorite exists. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, there are a couple of cannabis podcasts that honestly pour
[09:42.520 --> 09:46.440]  the living fuck out of me and I can't listen to them. Uh, they just, they're just, and today in
[09:46.440 --> 09:51.800]  cannabis and I'm like, Oh, fucking shut up. But that's, but I'm still friends with those guys.
[09:51.800 --> 09:54.440]  You know what I mean? If they're like, Hey, we're, we're going to get shut down. If you don't give
[09:54.440 --> 09:58.840]  me $2, I'd fucking give him $2. Like, yeah, I support all the cannabis podcasts. There's no
[09:58.840 --> 10:02.920]  competition. I love that some people feel I am the best that I am their favorite. That's fucking
[10:02.920 --> 10:09.240]  awesome. But the, uh, the podcast, if I were to listen to another podcast frequently, and the
[10:09.240 --> 10:15.160]  reason that I don't is because I don't want to contaminate my, myself. I don't want to recite
[10:15.160 --> 10:20.360]  somebody else's podcast voice or style or whatever. I don't want to do it on accident. I catch myself
[10:21.080 --> 10:25.160]  turning into Joe Rogan occasionally when I go on a rant, I'm Dennis Miller and Joe Rogan,
[10:25.160 --> 10:29.960]  uh, Dennis Miller from the early nineties. You can get some, a lot of people, our age rant,
[10:29.960 --> 10:34.200]  like Dennis Miller's no cure for cancer album. Yeah. Yeah. We can't help. I used to watch the,
[10:34.200 --> 10:38.280]  uh, with the show that he had, I can't even remember the show. He had an HBO show and it
[10:38.280 --> 10:43.480]  was fucking hilarious. That was when I was kind of new at smoking pot at home. Like I still live
[10:43.480 --> 10:47.640]  with my mom at the time and my parents and shit, I was young, but I would smoke pot at home and she
[10:47.640 --> 10:51.240]  knew, but she wouldn't say shit. So when Dennis Miller's comedy show, I still, I wish I could
[10:51.240 --> 10:55.320]  think of the name of it. When Dennis Miller's comedy show came on on HBO, it was just like
[10:55.320 --> 10:59.720]  99% sure it was no cure for cancer. Is it the one that wasn't a, it wasn't a standup show. It was
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.640]  like a recurring. Yeah. It was like a sketch show weekly. But every time that would come on, I
[11:03.640 --> 11:07.800]  remember I would pack up the ball and I would fucking sit in the edge of the bed and hit the
[11:07.800 --> 11:12.600]  bong and get all stone and laugh my ass off to that Dennis Miller fucking show. It was hilarious.
[11:13.160 --> 11:18.440]  Um, but so, and then I also, I catch myself doing Rogan and Dennis Miller and a lot of times
[11:18.440 --> 11:25.400]  Joey, I catch myself doing Joey Diaz sometimes when, uh, when you're going on a rest, especially
[11:25.400 --> 11:30.840]  on a good solo show when you're fairly baked, you'll hear Joey pop out occasionally. Yeah. But
[11:30.840 --> 11:37.320]  sometimes less than intentionally I've heard so much Joe Rogan and Joey Diaz that said, I don't
[11:37.320 --> 11:43.800]  want to do that. I don't want to turn into Danny Danko or Adam Dunn or even more specifically
[11:43.800 --> 11:47.640]  Scotty real in the dude, right? Uh, because that's who I'm talking about. Scotty real in the dude,
[11:47.640 --> 11:52.120]  a host, a show called the dude grow show. And they gave us a shout out. They gave me a shout
[11:52.120 --> 11:56.760]  out technically, but they kind of shared it with white Mike. Every episode, the dude grow show
[11:56.760 --> 12:02.280]  does a segment called the executive producer and they pick somebody who has inspired them or done
[12:02.280 --> 12:06.040]  something that they feel it's basically how I give everyone a shout out at the end of the show.
[12:06.040 --> 12:09.720]  They do it at the start of the show. They say executive producer this episode. And a few days
[12:09.720 --> 12:14.280]  ago they said Rasta Jeff and they gave me a nice shout out. Uh, and then they mentioned that I do
[12:14.280 --> 12:20.440]  the show by myself. And, uh, a lot of the time, a lot of the times I do probably 70% of these
[12:20.440 --> 12:24.520]  podcasts by myself, but then they mentioned white Mike comes and joins him and he has a lot of cool
[12:24.520 --> 12:29.640]  people on there with them also. So they specifically said white Mike. So I might, I'm, I'm,
[12:30.600 --> 12:36.040]  uh, how do I even say this? Uh, I'm my least favorite guest that you have on.
[12:37.400 --> 12:40.280]  I like the shows where everybody else is on way better.
[12:40.280 --> 12:44.520]  Well, yeah, you, uh, you already know what you're going to say and you don't find you interesting.
[12:44.520 --> 12:49.000]  Sometimes I find me interesting. I feel the same about you, Mike.
[12:50.280 --> 12:56.200]  It's about 35, 40% of the time, but, uh, I'll look forward to when certain guests I know are
[12:56.200 --> 12:59.960]  going to be on. And like, I know when they're coming over to record. And then when I know
[12:59.960 --> 13:03.880]  they've recorded, I'm like, what the fuck is in there? No, you're right. Like I know what happened.
[13:03.880 --> 13:08.520]  I want to listen. My friends that have been on my show. I want you back. I just feel,
[13:08.520 --> 13:12.280]  it feels awkward asking my friends, do you have time to come be on my show? Because everyone's
[13:12.280 --> 13:16.600]  fucking busy, especially with the holidays, especially since most of you are growers.
[13:16.600 --> 13:21.480]  This last year has been insane for everybody. Everybody. A lot of us like myself run a
[13:21.480 --> 13:26.200]  commercial grow and then do consulting for somebody else's grow and then try to have our
[13:26.200 --> 13:30.840]  own small private grow. And then we also have lives. You know what I mean? I teach drum lessons
[13:32.200 --> 13:36.120]  other gigs. No, we couldn't have done this tomorrow. Cause I'm going to be Christmas shop.
[13:36.120 --> 13:41.000]  Sorry about the giant cough did not mean to throw out a giant cough. Yeah. It's the,
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.040]  there's a cold going around. Sorry folks. Yeah. We're trying. I'm sniffling a little bit too.
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.560]  I was just, we're super busy getting over here. Even for me, like to do a 45 minute show,
[13:52.280 --> 13:55.800]  like we work together and we just slip over here after work and I looked at Mike and I was like,
[13:55.800 --> 13:59.080]  podcast, let's go drive right to my house so that we can record a podcast right now. Let's go. Let's
[13:59.080 --> 14:04.280]  go Friday. It's dumb luck. My wife is out with the niece and the kids. So I had 45 minutes where I
[14:04.280 --> 14:10.440]  could squeeze away free. Otherwise I'd be cooking right now. Nice. Like I feel a little bit anxious
[14:10.440 --> 14:14.520]  because normally I have responsibilities for this segment of time during the day.
[14:14.520 --> 14:18.200]  They're like, who's got this going on? Who took care of this? Yup. But anyway,
[14:18.200 --> 14:21.480]  uh, I won't want to get more of my friends on here. It's just weird asking people, Hey,
[14:21.480 --> 14:25.400]  come be on the podcast. So all you guys have been on here before and have good stuff to contribute
[14:25.400 --> 14:29.560]  by all means and send them a text and say, you want to get on the show? Yeah, do it. Let's get
[14:29.560 --> 14:33.080]  together. Facebook me, message me somehow. You guys are all invited back. Come be on the show,
[14:33.080 --> 14:37.640]  please. And when I see you, I'll hit you up. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll ask you. But
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.760]  anyway, the dude grows, gave us a huge, a huge shout out. Uh, dude, the dude grows. If I were
[14:42.760 --> 14:46.040]  listening to a cannabis podcast, that's the one I would hit play. If you look at my playlist,
[14:46.040 --> 14:50.840]  it's the spliff podcast with Bo, who's taking a little break. She's on a hiatus. Shout out to Bo.
[14:50.840 --> 14:55.960]  And then the next podcast in line is our friends at the dude grows. Those are my favorites list.
[14:55.960 --> 15:01.000]  The dude grows cup is coming up in April. Uh, I know the date of it, but I don't remember it off
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.160]  the top of my head. I've got it in a message. So the dude grows cup is coming. If things line up
[15:05.160 --> 15:09.320]  for me, I will go to that event. I have to make sure there's nothing else more pressing at the
[15:09.320 --> 15:14.760]  time. Uh, I have to figure out priorities and work and all that shit, but I should be able to
[15:14.760 --> 15:20.920]  make that. So right. Stone, uh, April tends to be a pretty busy month for us. Yeah. Yeah. And
[15:20.920 --> 15:26.120]  this industry and yeah, it will be huge. There's a bunch of celebrating that the community does
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.480]  during then. But when you work in the industry, that's, that's your Christmas. That's yes. Uh,
[15:31.480 --> 15:35.720]  the dude or Scotty, when you guys message me, let me know about the dude grows cup. Let me know
[15:35.720 --> 15:40.680]  about boots. Let me know about vending. Can I vend to seeds at the dude grows cup? Uh, can I set
[15:40.680 --> 15:46.280]  up a booth and then to seeds that would have a lot to do with my attendance. Um, either way,
[15:46.280 --> 15:51.880]  I'm going to do my best to be there. So let's see. Yeah, I'm going to press pause and I'm going to
[15:51.880 --> 15:55.640]  pull up a message from Mike. Why don't you just talk for a second? You're here for a reason.
[15:55.640 --> 15:59.480]  Talk for a couple of seconds about some shit while I find a screenshot of a message that I say,
[15:59.480 --> 16:03.800]  Oh, you're putting me on the spot. Well, I hope you all had a good Christmas. Everybody
[16:04.520 --> 16:07.960]  got nothing. This is going to come out. All right. The message isn't going to be too hard to find.
[16:08.520 --> 16:14.200]  Find that cool cousin. Go for a good walk before dinner. Introduce them to the podcast. Yeah. Uh,
[16:14.200 --> 16:19.160]  but if you do smoke with somebody that's new, go gentle. Don't, don't steer them away from cannabis.
[16:19.160 --> 16:23.800]  Yep. Go easy. Give them the spiel about how you eat one edible and wait two hours. Don't eat the
[16:23.800 --> 16:29.160]  whole candy bar. Give them, give them a nice gentle intro. Or maybe if it's like, you know,
[16:29.160 --> 16:34.200]  your cousin who thinks he's cool and thinks he's hard. No, that's like Darren, a teenager
[16:34.200 --> 16:38.120]  to drink all the one 51. Like they're going to try and then you're going to feel like an
[16:38.120 --> 16:44.360]  asshole for doing it or just go easy. Or are you? Oh, you probably will really all depends
[16:44.360 --> 16:51.480]  whose car they throw up in. Right. Just gave me a shitty flashback. I think I just gave everyone a
[16:51.480 --> 16:55.880]  shitty flashback. Like that's why it's not cool to do that with edibles. And then I heard this
[16:55.880 --> 16:59.160]  gurgling noise. Then I looked in my rear view mirror and I wish I hadn't looked in the mirror
[16:59.160 --> 17:03.560]  because I just watched vomit flat of both nose holes and the mouth all into the backseat of my
[17:03.560 --> 17:09.160]  car. And I was like, Oh, that's why you don't give drunk people a ride home. Yep. Yep. Oops. All
[17:09.160 --> 17:14.040]  right. So I did find the message here. Uh, no, that's not the correct message. I lied. I got to
[17:14.040 --> 17:18.920]  keep going. This is screenshot and it's just not a screenshot of the correct message here. I think
[17:19.000 --> 17:25.560]  this is it. All right. This was, so it says question for the community.
[17:28.120 --> 17:30.760]  And then I'm going to kind of edit it because I don't know where the original message came from.
[17:30.760 --> 17:36.040]  Somebody took a screenshot of this and then sent this to me and said, what's your opinion?
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.520]  So it says question for the community. First, I like to say, I already know what I'm going to do
[17:40.520 --> 17:46.440]  in regards to this. However, I'm curious to see if there is one sentiment over the other. Then
[17:46.440 --> 17:51.720]  it says scenario grower gets seeds from a breeder and or a seed bank finds a rare cut or a select
[17:51.720 --> 17:57.080]  Fino would getting a cut back to the breeder be the right thing to do to be clear. Nobody has asked
[17:57.080 --> 18:02.760]  for it or has suggested doing so the cut isn't necessarily for breeding, but more as a gesture,
[18:02.760 --> 18:08.840]  or would you just keep it and sit on it for your own enjoyment? And then this guy also kind of
[18:08.840 --> 18:14.680]  asked me, uh, how do you feel about people breeding with your seeds? Uh, once you sell them
[18:14.680 --> 18:22.360]  seeds. So the first part is to be more clear about the question. If somebody were to go obtain
[18:22.360 --> 18:25.800]  IRI genetic seeds, however you get them, if you get them from me, if you get them from the hell
[18:25.800 --> 18:30.120]  of dank seed bank, uh, if they fell out of the sky, however you ended up with them, if you were
[18:30.120 --> 18:35.480]  to grow them and you were to find something stellar, are you supposed to get me a clone of that?
[18:37.160 --> 18:41.960]  I don't expect shit, but it would be cool if you live near me. If you're around,
[18:41.960 --> 18:47.080]  I think if you expect it, you're a douche bag, but if you offer it like it's definitely not
[18:47.080 --> 18:51.240]  expected, but it's, it's cool. And sometimes it's probably not wanted.
[18:52.280 --> 18:57.480]  Like if you got one, like our friends at Organica having a rise that tested at 35%,
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.920]  cool. Bring me a clone. I'd love a clone of that. But if I don't get one, that's fine with me.
[19:02.920 --> 19:07.800]  Because at the same level, if I told you I had a fire arise, you know, and did you want to cut?
[19:07.880 --> 19:12.120]  You'd probably say no. You probably come over and check it out before you go.
[19:12.120 --> 19:14.920]  Look at yours. I'd go look at yours. Like I go take pictures of it.
[19:14.920 --> 19:19.240]  I'm thinking of all the people that used to bring those half dead clones into,
[19:19.240 --> 19:22.280]  to metamar back in the day. I'd be like, what's wrong with my plants? Yo,
[19:22.280 --> 19:26.120]  and you'd look at it and be like, yo, that's cotton balls. Oh, nope. That's spider mite webbing.
[19:26.120 --> 19:33.400]  Yeah. Yeah. Well my, my take on it is, uh, I sold that seed. Like that seed went like,
[19:33.400 --> 19:37.160]  if it went to a distributor, he paid me for it. And then you paid him for it. Now it's past,
[19:37.160 --> 19:43.560]  it's left me twice. It's yours. I don't expect anything in return when you go to only very
[19:43.560 --> 19:48.840]  recently was this even possible, right? But when you go to the grocery store, wherever your local
[19:48.840 --> 19:52.200]  store is and you buy all your ingredients to make fucking, what are you going to make tonight for
[19:52.200 --> 19:56.120]  dinners and pizzas or whatever? And then you go home and you make your pizza and you bake it.
[19:56.120 --> 19:59.480]  You don't drive back to the store and offer everyone at the store. Hey, I got this shit
[19:59.480 --> 20:05.400]  here. Here's a slice of the pizza I made. But if I give you some like chickens and then you raise
[20:05.400 --> 20:09.800]  them up, like you might bring me some chicken. Now I might bring it depends on the what though.
[20:09.800 --> 20:15.720]  Yeah. Well I don't expect anything in return. And now another part of this is a breeder has
[20:15.720 --> 20:22.200]  probably grown that strain enough to have found that phenotype that you've got. It's going to be
[20:22.200 --> 20:27.320]  very unlikely that you find something that you've got it. Odds are they've seen it. Yeah. Yeah. And
[20:27.320 --> 20:32.040]  we've probably got a, uh, we've got the fire phenotype. It is a really cool gesture. If you
[20:32.600 --> 20:38.120]  near the breeder, like our friends in Organica or in Albuquerque, maybe if they are coming this way
[20:38.120 --> 20:42.360]  and there's, they would have to have a medical marijuana patient. Oh no. Cause we're legit here.
[20:42.360 --> 20:46.760]  So they'd have to have a color, a New Mexico medical marijuana patient in the car. And then
[20:46.760 --> 20:51.080]  commit a different federal crime when you're driving across the border. Yeah. But there's
[20:51.080 --> 20:55.880]  no feds sitting on the line between New Mexico and Colorado. What if there's that wine? What if the
[20:55.880 --> 21:00.600]  wine is as thick as the, as the tip of this pen and they set the seeds right on the tip of this pen
[21:00.600 --> 21:05.480]  to where it's half on Colorado, half on New Mexico. And one guy drops it. One guy picks it up.
[21:05.480 --> 21:08.760]  Cops. Aren't meant to debate technicalities with you. They're meant to hit you with the
[21:08.760 --> 21:13.960]  nightstick until you stop resisting and ruin your life. However, if you wanted to bring me the clone,
[21:13.960 --> 21:18.680]  wherever you could do it, you could, I'd be, I'd be happy with that, but it's not required. Once I've,
[21:18.680 --> 21:24.520]  once that seed has been given out, that is your seed. Unless the offer is a tester and there was
[21:24.520 --> 21:29.640]  an agreement. If it's a purchased seed from a vendor that makes it seem like it's not though,
[21:29.640 --> 21:33.720]  like that's specifically not what it says. Yeah. It says bought. I'm pretty sure that this message
[21:33.720 --> 21:40.200]  says purchased. Yep. So that that's my take on like, yeah, do whatever you want with that clone.
[21:40.200 --> 21:44.440]  Like you've got seeds and seeds are going everywhere and then clones are going to be
[21:44.440 --> 21:48.600]  made of clones and whatever you've, if you've got a cool phenotype, do whatever you want with it.
[21:48.600 --> 21:54.200]  It'd be cool if you got it back. I don't expect it. If maybe if you're in my area and you've got
[21:54.200 --> 21:57.880]  the one that won the cup or something, maybe, maybe hook me up so that I could read back to
[21:57.880 --> 22:02.520]  it or something, you know, but I'm probably thinking this way because I was listening to
[22:02.520 --> 22:09.240]  the dude gross show earlier in the dude gross show. And this came up specifically with a different,
[22:09.240 --> 22:16.280]  they were talking about a hydro stores in the mid nineties and early thousands. But I feel like,
[22:16.280 --> 22:21.560]  so I'm somebody like sub cool. And some random person hits me up on Instagram and is like, Hey,
[22:21.560 --> 22:27.560]  I bought a pack of your seeds on www.Iwantseeds.com. And I was wondering if you would like me to mail
[22:27.560 --> 22:33.000]  you a clone. I'd be like, no piggy. Yeah. Like how is this not entrapment? Right. That would be
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.680]  my first response. But now we're in Colorado and people are in California and Washington and Oregon.
[22:38.680 --> 22:44.600]  Someone, you know, shout out to our Michigan friends, all seven of them. But the further
[22:44.600 --> 22:49.960]  you're separated, I feel like the creepier that offer gets or the scarier maybe is a better word.
[22:49.960 --> 22:53.800]  But I put myself out there. So if somebody is like Ross to Jeff, I've got your clone.
[22:53.800 --> 22:57.960]  Like it seems it's just, I'm putting myself out there so much for people to interact with me that
[22:57.960 --> 23:02.680]  it doesn't feel creepy, but yeah, I'd still, uh, if you're not in Colorado, I'm going to probably
[23:02.680 --> 23:07.320]  decline. That's why I changed it to scary immediately because creepy is definitely not
[23:07.320 --> 23:13.320]  the right word, but yeah. Uh, the Capelton clone that I run, I did not Fino hunt that that came
[23:13.320 --> 23:17.640]  from a pack of seeds that I sold to somebody. So I actually, this has happened to somebody brought
[23:17.640 --> 23:23.400]  me Ralph Rasta, Ralph brought me back a clone of blue healer. So it does happen because he felt
[23:23.400 --> 23:26.280]  like he's like, this is a good one. You want this? And he brought me a clone of it. And you
[23:26.280 --> 23:30.040]  know what happened when he did? I gave him seeds in return for that clone again. So he got more
[23:30.040 --> 23:36.680]  seeds. Well, I know people that have suffered some sort of tragedy in their garden or, um,
[23:36.680 --> 23:42.840]  accidentally lost, uh, a whole Fino due to one thing or another cats seem to be particularly
[23:42.840 --> 23:47.560]  destructive. Why are your cats in your fucking grow room? What the fuck are people doing? Sorry.
[23:47.560 --> 23:52.280]  Fucking up. And, uh, don't take your dog to your commercial grow either. You're working on an IPM
[23:52.280 --> 23:55.240]  program in there. You're sprinting in there, you're releasing bugs in there and then you bring
[23:55.240 --> 24:01.640]  your dog in there. Stop it. Come on. Think it through. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So the,
[24:01.640 --> 24:06.600]  uh, the side B to this question was how I feel about people breeding with my seeds.
[24:07.400 --> 24:13.800]  Uh, yeah, go for it. Do that. The only thing I want the same reasons we just listed for the first
[24:13.800 --> 24:18.920]  half of the question. Yeah. But the only thing I want though is credit. When you, if you release
[24:18.920 --> 24:24.360]  that, when you post a picture of it, put the name of the parent strain on there. Like, yeah,
[24:24.360 --> 24:30.360]  be honest about it. Don't lie. Just put that it was arise or Capelton or whatever you used. Put
[24:30.360 --> 24:36.760]  that on there, list it. Yep. That's all I ask. And honestly, I got seeds from somebody to breed
[24:36.760 --> 24:41.480]  with. You know what I mean? I, and that's how I started mited and just infant plants. I got seeds
[24:41.480 --> 24:45.560]  and clones and use other people's seeds and clones for breeding. That's how it starts. You have to do
[24:45.560 --> 24:52.040]  something. It would be cool if you're going to make seeds commercially, make your own parents.
[24:52.840 --> 24:58.680]  Like don't just go take, and I know I'll just buy an established five pack and call them. Yeah. Yeah.
[24:58.680 --> 25:02.920]  And I know I've done it. Of course I did it with daybreaker. I got a fucking packet daybreaker from
[25:02.920 --> 25:07.000]  gauge green and there was a male in there. I was like, God damn, he's gotta be used for breeding.
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.560]  So I dusted a bunch of shit with him and made a bunch of stuff. But then I used my favorite mail
[25:11.560 --> 25:16.280]  out of that breeding project from the golden goat to daybreaker, which became a rise. And that's my
[25:16.280 --> 25:20.600]  new mail. So I've done some work with the mail I'm using as my main stud for my breeding. Now,
[25:20.600 --> 25:25.560]  I didn't just go pull one from somebody else's, but I've used four or five different mails
[25:25.560 --> 25:31.400]  throughout different breeding projects lately. So, uh, I am using other people's shit. Like you
[25:31.400 --> 25:34.360]  have to use other people. And if you don't, then you're just breeding forever.
[25:35.240 --> 25:40.520]  Like at this point, there's no reason to reinvent the wheel, like use what's available to you. And
[25:40.520 --> 25:44.440]  that's, what's on the market. There's, yeah, there's a lot of stuff you can do with it. And
[25:44.440 --> 25:48.840]  as long as you're not being super shady with it, like I'm all for it. I met DNA genetics at a
[25:48.840 --> 25:53.240]  cannabis cup years ago. Uh, and it was pretty cool because little Kevin was wearing an IRI
[25:53.240 --> 25:57.800]  genetics t-shirt and he was walking ahead of me. And I was walking with just a few other people
[25:57.800 --> 26:02.440]  in the group, you know, the group staggers, but Kevin was up front and the DNA genetics boys came
[26:02.440 --> 26:05.640]  around the corner and they go, Hey man, we've seen your logo around nice work. And Kevin's like,
[26:05.640 --> 26:08.760]  it's actually that guy. And they came and talked to me and I asked him straight up. I was like,
[26:08.760 --> 26:12.120]  Hey, do I have permission to breed and like commercially breed with your stuff? And they're
[26:12.120 --> 26:15.800]  like, fuck yeah. Just give us credit, bro. For anything you use, just give us credit.
[26:15.800 --> 26:20.120]  And that's exactly how I feel. Like if you make a package and you print something on it, it should
[26:20.120 --> 26:26.040]  say the true parents on there. You don't even have to put whatever arise for my region. Just put a
[26:26.040 --> 26:31.240]  rise to my new thing. And we're all happy. Yeah. You can use my stuff for breeding. I used,
[26:31.880 --> 26:36.280]  I've used some cool stuff. I've used everybody's stuff for breeding shit. I've read with everybody's
[26:36.280 --> 26:40.520]  projects. There's some DNA genetics in there. There's some ethos collective in my breeding.
[26:41.240 --> 26:45.960]  Uh, there's sub cool stuff in my breeding. There's a connection in there. I've got, yeah,
[26:45.960 --> 26:52.280]  there's a little bit of everything in there. Reserve a provada. I hope that answers the
[26:52.280 --> 26:57.720]  question. We got a little rambly. Oh, I totally answered them. Yeah. It'd be cool if I got a clone,
[26:57.720 --> 27:02.840]  not required. You're not a dick. If you don't like some people can't share, they got to grow
[27:02.840 --> 27:07.640]  quietly. So that it's sharing. Yeah. And there's, they can't because they're in Odessa, Texas and
[27:07.640 --> 27:13.160]  they can't fucking talk about it. Now they're on the far end from those reasons. There's a
[27:14.200 --> 27:22.520]  different people, um, that, uh, are looking to patent cannabis genetics,
[27:22.520 --> 27:27.320]  you know, in other breeding, other plants. That's a thing. Yep. Like I couldn't cross two different
[27:27.320 --> 27:30.520]  breeders, tomatoes together and then try to commercially sell them. They would say,
[27:30.520 --> 27:35.240]  fuck, no. There's a couple of outfits that are just waiting for federal legalization where they
[27:35.240 --> 27:39.160]  can pounce on it. They're going to have all their paperwork ready to just mass submit.
[27:39.160 --> 27:46.200]  Yeah. Unfortunately I don't have the funding for that type of stuff. Not yet. Not yet. Mike was in
[27:46.200 --> 27:52.200]  on a talk today. Next year is going to be fun people. Yes. No matter what happens, even if
[27:52.200 --> 27:55.480]  what we talked about today didn't pan out, I'm going to have to switch from Mountain Dew to
[27:55.480 --> 28:00.680]  energy drinks or something next year. I think that's what I'm thinking. Just straight coffee
[28:00.680 --> 28:06.600]  and Red Bull. Cut the coffee with Red Bull. Just, just switch to straight pods of espresso.
[28:07.560 --> 28:13.800]  It's going to be a fun year next year. We're going to go super fast. Oh man, I can't wait.
[28:13.800 --> 28:17.960]  Hell yeah. What, uh, what else we got on the punch sheet, buddy? You know, we've done almost 30
[28:17.960 --> 28:22.440]  minutes. So, uh, do you have anything that you want to ramble about? Because I don't want to go,
[28:22.520 --> 28:28.360]  uh, I feel like you guys that are listening to Christmas show, dude, I've got a big angry rant
[28:28.360 --> 28:33.880]  in me. Um, that's been cooking for a couple of weeks, but now I just, it's Christmas. Let's not
[28:33.880 --> 28:37.240]  burn them down with the Mike rant. You guys that are listening on a Christmas to a Christmas
[28:37.240 --> 28:41.880]  episode. Uh, thank you. I appreciate you guys for listening to it. Like just a 30 minute, just Mike
[28:41.880 --> 28:44.680]  and Jeff hanging out, kicking it. Thanks for making this part of your holiday. Let's take a
[28:44.680 --> 28:50.600]  dab, dude. Let's definitely take a dab. But, uh, this is not the end of the episode, but they're
[28:50.600 --> 28:55.080]  what you don't need to pick up a pen or a notebook for sure. From here out, I guarantee the learning
[28:55.080 --> 29:02.600]  is done. You guys. Um, yeah, I'm going to save that rant for another show, but, uh, Merry Christmas,
[29:02.600 --> 29:07.960]  everybody. I hope you have, uh, some good people to spend it with some good food to eat,
[29:08.520 --> 29:13.000]  some wonderful cannabis to consume. If you're into that, maybe a nice wine. If you're into that,
[29:13.960 --> 29:18.280]  just, uh, hopefully you got somebody to love on this, this holiday season. And if you don't,
[29:18.280 --> 29:23.000]  um, tweet me, I'll tweet back at you. I was going to say that sounds fucking gross.
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.960]  You got someone to love on tweet me. Yep. I'm not going to love on you, but like, I'll say hi on
[29:27.960 --> 29:33.160]  Twitter. I'll let you pet my dog. Maybe I'll send you a DM of a picture of whatever, whatever I'm
[29:33.160 --> 29:37.560]  about to dab. You're just making it more and more depressing. You don't got someone to love on. Well,
[29:37.560 --> 29:43.400]  I'm sorry. Go fuck yourself. Flashlights is on sale. Whoa. This show is taking a weird turn.
[29:43.400 --> 29:48.040]  Okay. Remember those times when I was like, Mike ramble a little bit. I am starting to regret it
[29:48.040 --> 29:54.360]  right now. See the hash is coming out. The torch is coming out. Yeah. We're going to fix you. This
[29:54.360 --> 29:58.840]  is dab is for me. I kind of wish I'd gotten it for you because your head needs some mass actions.
[29:58.840 --> 30:05.240]  No. Yeah. Just thanks for including us in your holiday cheer. Guys. We appreciate it. Look for a
[30:05.240 --> 30:09.320]  Mike rant sometime in January. I'm going to set this one aside. Cause I got to save some of that
[30:09.320 --> 30:13.800]  one for, uh, Oh, and there were a bunch of people on Instagram live one night trying to get me to
[30:13.800 --> 30:20.200]  join, uh, Russ, this video that might happen in 2018. Mike's kind of camera shy. He's not a video
[30:20.200 --> 30:25.800]  friendly dude. Um, yeah. Uh, I've apparently I've got a voice for radio. I'm not sure about the
[30:25.800 --> 30:34.200]  face. Totally got a face for radio, buddy. That's cold. But, uh, yeah, one day I'll get cleaned up a
[30:34.200 --> 30:40.040]  little bit and I'll, uh, I'll join the Instagram live world. Just not today. You guys, this episode
[30:40.040 --> 30:45.000]  is coming out at the end of the year. You got like a week left in this year. So if you didn't
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.880]  do what you wanted to do this year, you got some time to set some goals for next year. Goals are
[30:49.880 --> 30:54.520]  fucking awesome. Write something down, something you want to accomplish, no matter how big nor
[30:54.520 --> 30:59.240]  small it is, write it down and say, I'm going to fucking do this this year and make it happen.
[30:59.240 --> 31:03.400]  And if it's just a little tiny thing, knock it out and then write down a bigger thing.
[31:03.400 --> 31:06.520]  And then when you knock out all those little things, you're going to say, man, I wrote down
[31:06.520 --> 31:09.480]  some shit and I got it done. I'm gonna write down some harder shit. And then I'm gonna get
[31:09.480 --> 31:12.680]  some harder shit done. And then you'll just start getting shit done or it'll just start flowing.
[31:12.680 --> 31:15.960]  You'd be like, yeah, I'm going to make more goals and I'm going to do more shit. And this year is
[31:15.960 --> 31:18.840]  going to get better and better. And I'm going to start just making more money and stacking more
[31:18.840 --> 31:23.320]  shit up and growing better. And yeah, anyway, it just starts flowing. I mean, you just start doing
[31:23.320 --> 31:28.040]  shit. And then I get off on a rant, I started rolling. I heated the nail. Uh, it's not as hot
[31:28.040 --> 31:34.680]  as it should be. I'm going to reheat here. A little reheat. Can I get a reheat? Set some goals.
[31:35.000 --> 31:38.440]  That was my goddamn point. Set some goals, have some goals, accomplish some goals.
[31:39.000 --> 31:44.360]  I don't know anybody that's content, like strive for better people. You can do it. Read a book,
[31:46.200 --> 31:51.320]  strive for a new job, learn a new skill, grow better, listen to more shows.
[31:52.840 --> 31:59.000]  Do you do the new year's resolution thing? I don't. Um, you gave up giving up shit for
[31:59.240 --> 32:04.600]  one year. Yep. That's legitimately true. One year. And I had a bunch of friends in college
[32:04.600 --> 32:07.960]  one year for Lent that were like, we know you're not religious, but everybody's given up for
[32:07.960 --> 32:12.280]  something for Lent. You should give something up. And so I gave up my mountain dues for Lent. And
[32:13.080 --> 32:16.360]  the next day they were like, no, you can't just fucking switch to Dr. Pepper bitch.
[32:17.560 --> 32:22.200]  So then I actually gave up caffeine for Lent. And I even went an extra day because they,
[32:22.200 --> 32:27.640]  they were pretty adamant that the Dr. Pepper I had the morning of the first day of Lent was cheating.
[32:28.360 --> 32:33.160]  Um, in the next year, I was like, no fuck all y'all I'm giving up giving up stuff for Lent.
[32:34.280 --> 32:37.320]  And I'm just going to keep that going forever. And it's been like 15 years now, but
[32:38.200 --> 32:42.760]  setting goals kind of at the beginning of the year, um, where would I like to be at the end
[32:42.760 --> 32:49.640]  of the next year? Um, you know, little stuff like I want to get this room cleaned out or big stuff.
[32:49.640 --> 32:56.680]  Like I want to start a different career path or, uh, buy a new car, buy a new house. I mean,
[32:56.680 --> 33:00.520]  it can be anything in that range, folks just take a few minutes over the holiday season.
[33:01.080 --> 33:05.720]  You know, if you're me, you're probably going to pack a bowl, sit back, put your feet up. Think
[33:05.720 --> 33:09.640]  about it for a few. Where do you want to be this time next year? Do you want to be in the same
[33:09.640 --> 33:14.040]  spot you're in now? Do you want to be wearing the same jeans? Do you want a totally different life?
[33:14.040 --> 33:17.000]  Do you want to be in a different room? Do you want to be with different people? Do you want to be
[33:17.640 --> 33:22.520]  employed in a different industry and make that change for yourself, man, change is a constant
[33:22.520 --> 33:27.240]  in life. And if you don't embrace it, it's going to destroy you. Like I'm watching people try to
[33:27.240 --> 33:32.840]  hold onto the past all day, watching prohibitionists online and like it kills them little
[33:32.840 --> 33:39.240]  by little day by day. Just trying to hold onto the past ruins their lives. Don't do it. Set some
[33:39.240 --> 33:43.960]  goals, make some change. There's a dab for you, sir. Yeah. But like, I don't even believe in like,
[33:43.960 --> 33:48.200]  I think scales are unhealthy. There's a lot of people that try to lose weight after the holidays.
[33:48.200 --> 33:52.520]  Pick that fucking scale, throw it in the trash. Yeah. Like that's just bad for your mental health.
[33:52.520 --> 33:56.680]  Yeah. It's a number who cares? Like your hotness is not determined by a random number.
[33:57.240 --> 34:03.240]  God, I've said that same sentence to somebody. I think. No, I, it's where I spend a lot of time
[34:03.240 --> 34:07.560]  online following prohibitionists and you end up seeing their thoughts and opinions on all sorts
[34:07.560 --> 34:13.560]  of shit. And I see a lot of people that are like, man, I'm 134, but if I could be 128, I'd be happy.
[34:14.520 --> 34:18.360]  Now, if you didn't know those numbers, you'd be happier. At least I don't even know how much
[34:18.360 --> 34:23.400]  airway I know a range. When they asked me when I met the doctor, what do you, I shrugged and like,
[34:23.400 --> 34:27.640]  I have to get on the scale at every time. I was kind of surprised. Yeah. When, uh, when you go to
[34:27.640 --> 34:31.720]  like the MED to get your paperwork filled out and like, how tall are you? I'm six, five. How much do
[34:31.720 --> 34:35.560]  you weigh? I don't know. Somewhere between one 85 and two Oh five ish. I don't know. It depends on
[34:35.560 --> 34:40.120]  did I eat or did I poop? I don't know. How many times was that Chipotle this week? Yeah, exactly.
[34:40.120 --> 34:44.120]  I don't pay too much attention to it because I don't know. I just, if you eat right and you take
[34:44.120 --> 34:48.280]  care of yourself and the number on the scale doesn't matter. All right, Mike, you were off
[34:48.280 --> 34:51.880]  on a rant there for a minute. Something's had you fired up for the past few days. Here's a bubble
[34:51.880 --> 34:57.160]  cap to go with that. Um, I'll turn his mic down since it is Christmas. I'll help you guys out.
[34:57.160 --> 35:01.480]  Turn Mike's mic down just a little bit, dude. He is red as a candy cane right now. He looks like a
[35:01.480 --> 35:06.760]  candy cane. His face is red arms are as white as white people could fucking get looking like a
[35:06.760 --> 35:10.760]  striped candy cane over there. Say I see you trying to get words out. Make words happen. Mike.
[35:11.640 --> 35:21.160]  We're gonna teach Mike. Okay. Mike looks like the 40 year old virgin just took a dab. That's what
[35:21.160 --> 35:25.080]  Mike looks like right now. Yeah, you're pale and red at the same time. I don't know how you're two
[35:25.080 --> 35:32.600]  different colors, but you totally are. sweaty and dry. At the same time. I can see it.
[35:33.160 --> 35:38.360]  You guys, Mike encourages me to remind you to drink water, hydrate yourselves. I was trying
[35:38.360 --> 35:43.000]  to get Mike to drink water. Mike is like on a water strike or something. No, not a strike.
[35:46.200 --> 35:49.880]  He's got more to say. He just can't make it come out of his face. You guys, I really appreciate
[35:49.880 --> 35:53.560]  hanging out with you guys. It's been, I think I've been doing this podcast for like three years now
[35:53.560 --> 35:58.120]  or something. I've got 272 episodes. I know I'm cheating by counting the throwback Thursday
[35:58.600 --> 36:02.920]  episodes, but it just keeps it easier to keep it in line with numbers. But that means I've done at
[36:02.920 --> 36:08.520]  least 170 episodes or so. Thanks for hanging out so much. You guys have been hanging out for a
[36:08.520 --> 36:13.160]  couple of years. I appreciate it. I appreciate all the support. I appreciate all the interaction.
[36:13.160 --> 36:18.760]  I appreciate all the guests that have come and hung out. I like all the questions. The Patreon
[36:18.760 --> 36:24.920]  support is truly appreciated. You guys covered my website this year. Patreon paid for my website.
[36:25.880 --> 36:30.760]  Patreon paid for my website. You guys contributed enough to Patreon to cover the cost
[36:30.760 --> 36:35.080]  of hosting this podcast. This podcast did not come out of my pocket for the first time this year.
[36:35.720 --> 36:41.080]  That's awesome. It was not profitable, but that's not the goal. The goal of this podcast was never
[36:41.080 --> 36:45.720]  to be profitable. The goal of this podcast was to teach people how to grow better cannabis.
[36:45.720 --> 36:52.280]  And so we're reaching our goal. Oh, for sure. Yeah. But we have covered through Patreon
[36:52.280 --> 36:56.200]  donations and contributions, we paid for the cost of my website, which that was pretty cool.
[36:56.200 --> 36:59.000]  I didn't know that that was even possible. I didn't know that it would get there. I thought
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.440]  it would be 10 or 12 bucks a month. I never thought it would cover the whole website fee.
[37:02.440 --> 37:06.760]  Yeah. It totally covered a year of web hosting and the domain name. So that's pretty cool with
[37:06.760 --> 37:13.240]  the SSL certificate. So that's pretty cool. I appreciate that. Thank you guys. Merry Christmas.
[37:13.240 --> 37:17.720]  Happy whatever holiday. I know not everybody celebrates Christmas. I'm not going to be
[37:17.720 --> 37:23.400]  exclusive or denominational. Happy holiday. Happy winter time. Happy fucking get with your
[37:23.400 --> 37:29.320]  family time and have some good food season. Stay warm. Man. If you're in California where the fires
[37:29.320 --> 37:36.120]  are, be careful, be safe. Yeah. Remember that things aren't as important as lives. So if you
[37:36.120 --> 37:38.920]  got to go, if you got to get out of there, just get what you can and get out of there.
[37:40.200 --> 37:44.120]  You can get more shit, but you can't get more people. Get your people, get your pets and go.
[37:44.120 --> 37:49.320]  Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, I appreciate all the interaction. I was going to lead into, uh,
[37:50.360 --> 37:55.800]  uh, still begging for more interaction, like more Facebook stuff, more Instagram, more Twitter,
[37:55.800 --> 38:01.000]  and of course more emails. I love the emails. Uh, I get a lot of inspiration for the podcast from
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.160]  the emails, knowing that when somebody asks a question, they say one thing and I can answer
[38:05.160 --> 38:10.280]  that one person. I bet you I'm answering a bunch of people's questions. And if you haven't had the
[38:10.280 --> 38:14.680]  problem that that person's asking about yet in your garden, you may in the future. And you'll go,
[38:14.680 --> 38:18.760]  ah, shit. I heard Ross to Jeff talk about how to get rid of fungus gnats just because somebody else
[38:18.760 --> 38:23.320]  sent me the email about it. So I really liked those. It lets me know that I'm not just rambling.
[38:23.320 --> 38:27.400]  I'm not just talking at the wall. Somebody's getting some help from it. I like that a lot.
[38:27.400 --> 38:32.680]  So you guys keep the interactions coming, please. I truly do appreciate that on Facebook. Just
[38:32.680 --> 38:37.160]  search for the grow from your heart podcast on Twitter. It's at GFYH podcast on Instagram. That's
[38:37.160 --> 38:44.040]  where I switch it up. I use my other company is Irie. I R I E underscore genetics, G E N E T I C S
[38:44.040 --> 38:49.080]  Irie underscore genetics on Instagram. I post a bunch of great cannabis photography. I actually
[38:49.080 --> 38:55.000]  have been doing, uh, Instagram live videos where I go on Instagram live and do live Q and A's.
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.960]  Uh, I'll do the live Q and A's are awesome. If people just ask me random questions and I do my
[38:59.960 --> 39:04.680]  best to answer and the chat just scrolls by the chat just scrolls. And I do my best to answer
[39:04.680 --> 39:09.560]  those questions as quickly and efficiently as I can. Uh, and sometimes I get off on a rant there
[39:09.560 --> 39:14.280]  and I wish I was recording, but I'm usually not recording with my audio gear. So, and I don't
[39:14.280 --> 39:19.400]  leave the videos up. I like to delete them for some reason. I've got the option to leave them.
[39:19.400 --> 39:22.920]  Yeah. Yeah. I've got the option to leave them up where I could just take them down. And for some
[39:22.920 --> 39:26.440]  reason I just hit the don't share button and delete them and keep on moving. One of these
[39:26.440 --> 39:29.960]  times it's I'm going to be in that video too. Yeah. We'll get white Mike on there. He's a
[39:29.960 --> 39:36.840]  little shy. He's got a face for podcasting. Oh yeah. Uh, also there's a YouTube channel where
[39:36.840 --> 39:43.640]  we still don't show white Mike's face. So far. I think I've got about 130 ish videos. I don't
[39:43.640 --> 39:49.400]  want to lie to you and tell you too many. I know there's 130, 130 posted up there. Um, it's the
[39:49.400 --> 39:53.800]  grow from your heart channel on YouTube. I'm making more videos. They'll go up slowly. Uh,
[39:53.800 --> 39:58.520]  it's old material, but it's still there. So if you want to go check it out, I would appreciate that.
[39:58.520 --> 40:02.680]  And I mentioned Patreon earlier. Uh, it's Christmas time. Uh, I'm not trying to take
[40:02.680 --> 40:05.720]  money away from your family, get your family, some gifts, have a good new year's take your
[40:05.720 --> 40:09.560]  family out to dinner. But if you'd still like to contribute to the podcast after that, uh,
[40:09.560 --> 40:14.680]  you can go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart. Uh, check out all the signup information.
[40:14.680 --> 40:18.200]  Everything you want to know is right there. If you do choose to help me on Patreon,
[40:18.200 --> 40:22.520]  what you will be doing is paying for my website for next year, which is where I host the podcast,
[40:22.520 --> 40:27.320]  which is what allows me to give the podcast to everybody else for free until net neutrality
[40:27.320 --> 40:32.280]  kicks in. I'm going to keep this podcast free. It will be free from me forever. That's what I
[40:32.280 --> 40:37.800]  want to add. Take five seconds and write down like, you know, the little notepad in everybody's phone,
[40:37.800 --> 40:43.160]  write down what you're paying for internet right now. Just save that file for next year. Yep. Yep.
[40:43.160 --> 40:46.920]  Right back in the morning. Yep. What's your pain? Right down what you're paying for everything this
[40:46.920 --> 40:51.400]  year. Yep. Yeah. Right down what weed costs. Just write down a bunch of random prices and
[40:51.400 --> 40:55.000]  then tuck it away for a year and then open it up next year and see what the prices have changed.
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  But I'm going to keep this show free. That's my point. And net neutrality may change that for you,
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.080]  but it's not my fault. I'm not going to make any money off of that. It's some, that's your ISP.
[41:03.080 --> 41:07.320]  Yeah. Someone else is going to suck that shit up. But if you would like to contribute to the podcast
[41:07.320 --> 41:11.400]  and, uh, some people can, I'm not begging from, for everybody, but some people can,
[41:11.400 --> 41:15.080]  maybe you can pay for the website again next year. It's that sort of stuff. That's what it'll go for.
[41:15.080 --> 41:18.280]  It'll go for paying for the website. It'll go for these little fuzzy microphone covers.
[41:18.280 --> 41:21.960]  Uh, I've had a lot of this equipment for a long time. Some of it will take a shit one of these
[41:21.960 --> 41:25.880]  days. I'm sure. And I'll have to replace that. That's the sort of stuff that the Patreon covers.
[41:25.880 --> 41:29.080]  So patreon.com slash grow from your heart. I'd appreciate it if you check that out.
[41:29.080 --> 41:33.000]  I feel like I've been talking about Patreon for far too long, starting to feel like NPR.
[41:33.000 --> 41:37.560]  And with your support, we can continue to bring you free broadcasting about cannabis
[41:37.560 --> 41:43.720]  and the future of cannabis. A real Stony telethon. Jeff's going to sit here and take dabs till we hit
[41:43.720 --> 41:48.760]  that goal people. All right. Today you're dabbing at the red, gold and green level. And we're trying
[41:48.760 --> 41:54.360]  to get ourselves. Yeah, no, we can't do the NPR. What would our NPR show be?
[41:57.240 --> 42:02.840]  Oh, that's the Twitter question for Twitter verse. All right. Twitter verse. If we were on,
[42:02.840 --> 42:06.760]  if we had an NPR show, what would it be called? It wouldn't be called the growth from your heart
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.320]  podcast because NPR just wouldn't go for that. It would be something that didn't sound anything
[42:11.320 --> 42:14.440]  like it was about weed. You wouldn't know what the fuck the show was about until you listened
[42:14.440 --> 42:23.000]  to it by the title. All right. They like it when we ramble. Happy non-denominational holiday.
[42:24.040 --> 42:31.640]  Do you know what I miss life when we hadn't ginned up anxiety around holiday greetings?
[42:32.280 --> 42:37.720]  Yeah. It's become a, until a bunch of retards started pretending. I can't even say retard.
[42:37.720 --> 42:43.240]  I fucking can and did started pretending that the phrase Merry Christmas was under attack.
[42:43.960 --> 42:47.640]  Like there wasn't a thing you could say Merry Christmas or happy holidays. And
[42:47.640 --> 42:53.480]  as long as you didn't say, Hey, fuck you pal. Like you were fine. And now everyone is like a
[42:53.480 --> 42:57.640]  little anxious when they go to say happy holidays or Merry Christmas. It's stupid. You can't assume
[42:57.640 --> 43:03.480]  my gender or my holiday anymore. Just let it go. Yep. Yep. Had Mary, thank you for your holiday
[43:03.480 --> 43:08.680]  greeting. I appreciate it. We're friends too. Yeah. Feel free to send a hate tweets to Nemo
[43:08.840 --> 43:15.160]  funk 15 on Twitter. Yep. That's a way to wrap up a Patreon campaign.
[43:17.080 --> 43:20.360]  Send him money. Send me hateful tweets. No, no. That's what we're saying.
[43:20.360 --> 43:23.160]  Buy your family gifts. Hope everybody has a good, safe new year.
[43:23.160 --> 43:27.080]  A Mike, a reminder, but he, how they can hate you on social media.
[43:27.080 --> 43:32.840]  You can find me on Twitter at, at Nemo punk 15 or on Facebook at Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[43:33.640 --> 43:37.800]  Um, yeah, that's about the easiest ways to find me. Yep. Yep. Harass Mike. Let him know you're
[43:37.800 --> 43:41.320]  out there listening. Let him know you support him because he's podcast listeners. Love to find me on
[43:41.320 --> 43:46.360]  Instagram, which I don't really use, but you could find me there as well. Yeah. He's there. He just
[43:46.360 --> 43:51.720]  doesn't check it. I tag him in some stuff, so it'll make it easier for you. Yep. Uh, do we have
[43:51.720 --> 43:56.200]  anything else for the end of this show? Merry Christmas, everybody. Yes. Happy holidays. Merry
[43:56.200 --> 44:01.160]  Christmas. We will put our, I will be putting out a throwback Thursday episode. I'll put that
[44:01.160 --> 44:05.880]  together here at the start of the week. We'll put that out for Thursday. I'll be back Monday. I think
[44:05.880 --> 44:10.520]  Monday is the first of the year. So I'll be back Monday with some fresh content. I'm not sure what
[44:10.520 --> 44:16.520]  I'm going to do for the new year's episode, but it will happen. Um, just in case you were curious,
[44:16.520 --> 44:20.920]  battery sufficiently charged. My phone just decided to let me know that low power mode has been
[44:20.920 --> 44:27.000]  turned off. Nice. It vibrated and flashed really abruptly. So the phone is cool and it's look at
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.840]  that. It's seven Oh nine. And it's time to wrap up the podcast. Usually I do a shout out to a specific
[44:32.840 --> 44:36.120]  person, but this time we're going to do a large group. I want to give a shout out to everybody
[44:36.120 --> 44:41.000]  working on Christmas. All of you folks working in a grow that are keeping the plants alive that are
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.880]  showing up. And if, if, and if even God, I can't talk now, shit, even if you're not working in a
[44:45.880 --> 44:49.240]  grow, if you're working wherever you're working, keeping that business going, if you're working in
[44:49.240 --> 44:55.160]  your own private garden, if you are taking care of a sick person and doing your job, taking care of
[44:55.160 --> 44:59.240]  a sick relative or family member, or even more a fucking stranger, because you're a compassionate
[44:59.240 --> 45:03.560]  person. If you're working, if you're putting in hours on a holiday, we're giving you a big old
[45:03.560 --> 45:08.360]  shout out. So shout out to all you people running on a holiday. That's right. That is right. All
[45:08.360 --> 45:13.880]  you working people working on, on the holidays. Thank you. Big shout out until next time, take a
[45:13.880 --> 45:16.520]  fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
