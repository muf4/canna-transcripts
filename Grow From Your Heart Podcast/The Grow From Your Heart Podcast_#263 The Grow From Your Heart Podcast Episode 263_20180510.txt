[00:58.710 --> 01:04.710]  This baby hits 88 miles per hour.
[01:04.710 --> 01:09.710]  You're gonna see some serious shit.
[01:09.710 --> 01:15.710]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[01:15.710 --> 01:16.710]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[01:17.110 --> 01:20.510]  It's Thursday, and that means it's time for another Throwback Thursday episode of the
[01:20.510 --> 01:21.510]  Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:21.510 --> 01:25.470]  Before we get to the old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[01:25.470 --> 01:29.910]  If I mention any advertising, any giveaways, any promotions, or any contests, all of that
[01:29.910 --> 01:31.250]  stuff has expired.
[01:31.250 --> 01:35.990]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways, or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[01:35.990 --> 01:37.750]  I want to thank you guys for listening.
[01:37.750 --> 01:42.790]  And with no further ado, here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:43.790 --> 02:00.500]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[02:00.500 --> 02:05.500]  It's time for episode number 141 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source for cannabis
[02:05.500 --> 02:07.500]  news, education, and conversation.
[02:07.500 --> 02:11.500]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker,
[02:11.500 --> 02:15.500]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist, or even someone who's just curious
[02:15.500 --> 02:19.500]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[02:19.500 --> 02:22.500]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeGeff.
[02:22.500 --> 02:23.500]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[02:23.500 --> 02:27.500]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[02:27.500 --> 02:29.500]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[02:29.500 --> 02:33.500]  Big shout out to Kat, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:36.500 --> 02:37.500]  Happy Independence Day, everybody.
[02:37.500 --> 02:39.500]  This episode will be coming out on the 4th of July.
[02:40.500 --> 02:43.500]  And I hope everybody has a great holiday, or had a great holiday.
[02:44.500 --> 02:47.500]  It's great that this episode came out on the 4th of July, because this episode features
[02:47.500 --> 02:52.500]  Steve DeFino of the Veteran Farmers Alliance, and a couple of his buddies from the CFC.
[02:53.500 --> 02:56.500]  Big shout out to Steve and his friends for joining me on the podcast.
[02:56.500 --> 02:58.500]  Make sure you check out the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[02:58.500 --> 03:00.500]  Make sure you follow all my friends on their social media.
[03:00.500 --> 03:03.500]  We will mention their social media feeds right at the beginning.
[03:03.500 --> 03:07.500]  So, I'm going to let this music play for a couple of seconds, and when we get back,
[03:07.500 --> 03:10.500]  we will be joined by Steve DeFino, John, and Quinn.
[03:10.500 --> 03:12.500]  Hang on for just a second, you guys.
[03:15.500 --> 03:22.700]  Gentlemen, welcome back.
[03:22.700 --> 03:24.700]  We were hanging out in Colorado Springs.
[03:24.700 --> 03:25.700]  I almost revealed the location.
[03:25.700 --> 03:26.700]  I probably shouldn't do that.
[03:26.700 --> 03:28.700]  We were at a secret location in a lovely basement, smoking out.
[03:28.700 --> 03:32.700]  We got the windows open on a lovely Colorado summer evening.
[03:32.700 --> 03:34.700]  Joining me is my new friend, Quinton.
[03:34.700 --> 03:38.700]  Dude, thanks a lot for fixing my SD card so that we can record a podcast tonight.
[03:38.700 --> 03:39.700]  Yeah, no problem.
[03:39.700 --> 03:40.700]  Welcome to the show.
[03:40.700 --> 03:41.700]  Thank you.
[03:41.700 --> 03:44.700]  Do you have any Instagram or social media that people can follow while they're listening
[03:44.700 --> 03:45.700]  to your lovely voice?
[03:45.700 --> 03:47.700]  I do have a Facebook under QuintonSpitler.
[03:47.700 --> 03:48.700]  That's about it.
[03:48.700 --> 03:49.700]  Check him out if you want to, guys.
[03:49.700 --> 03:51.700]  Check him out while you're listening.
[03:51.700 --> 03:52.700]  Not if you're driving, though.
[03:52.700 --> 03:53.700]  Don't do that.
[03:53.700 --> 03:56.700]  Across from me is a local celebrity, kind of a hero of sorts.
[03:57.700 --> 03:58.700]  Yeah, he's getting well-known.
[03:58.700 --> 04:00.700]  You've been on so many podcasts.
[04:00.700 --> 04:01.700]  You've been in a couple of publications.
[04:01.700 --> 04:04.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast, my friend Steve DeFino.
[04:04.700 --> 04:05.700]  Welcome, brother.
[04:05.700 --> 04:06.700]  What's going on, man?
[04:06.700 --> 04:07.700]  How are you?
[04:07.700 --> 04:09.700]  Dude, thanks for having me at the â€“ does this basement have a name?
[04:09.700 --> 04:11.700]  Is this the TURT basement, the Dab basement?
[04:11.700 --> 04:12.700]  It's the hangout.
[04:12.700 --> 04:13.700]  It's like the dry place.
[04:13.700 --> 04:14.700]  Is your spot?
[04:14.700 --> 04:15.700]  Yeah.
[04:15.700 --> 04:16.700]  We've got some bugs drying over there.
[04:16.700 --> 04:17.700]  They smell delicious.
[04:17.700 --> 04:19.700]  As soon as I walked down here, I was like, ooh, fresh flowers.
[04:19.700 --> 04:21.700]  Good job on whoever did that.
[04:21.700 --> 04:22.700]  That was John.
[04:22.700 --> 04:23.700]  John, welcome to the show, bro.
[04:23.700 --> 04:24.700]  Hey, how's it going?
[04:24.700 --> 04:26.700]  Hey, guys, follow Steve DeFino on Instagram.
[04:26.700 --> 04:27.700]  It's triceraturps.
[04:27.700 --> 04:28.700]  That's right.
[04:28.700 --> 04:30.700]  Check out some lovely cannabis photography on there.
[04:30.700 --> 04:32.700]  John, how do my friends find you?
[04:32.700 --> 04:36.700]  How do my listeners find you on social media so they can stalk you while they listen?
[04:36.700 --> 04:38.700]  All right, my name is Jonathan Sakamoto.
[04:38.700 --> 04:45.700]  I'm on Facebook, and I also have an Instagram, and it's truly underscore living underscore organics.
[04:45.700 --> 04:48.700]  I just have some bud pictures and some other info on there.
[04:48.700 --> 04:49.700]  He tries to be modest.
[04:49.700 --> 04:51.700]  I just have some bud pictures on there.
[04:51.700 --> 04:53.700]  Truly living or true living organic.
[04:53.700 --> 04:54.700]  Truly living organics.
[04:54.700 --> 04:55.700]  Truly living organics.
[04:55.700 --> 04:56.700]  All right, check him out, you guys.
[04:56.700 --> 04:58.700]  Check him out on the social media.
[04:58.700 --> 04:59.700]  Follow all my friends here.
[04:59.700 --> 05:03.700]  So Steve actually invited me here to do this podcast.
[05:03.700 --> 05:08.700]  Steve, you guys probably remember if you listen to the show, he is the founder, president,
[05:08.700 --> 05:12.700]  chair dude, main veteran of the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[05:12.700 --> 05:13.700]  That's right.
[05:13.700 --> 05:18.700]  For my listeners that haven't been following, will you give us a little description of what the VFA does?
[05:18.700 --> 05:22.700]  Yeah, basically, I hold events for vets to bring them out of isolation.
[05:22.700 --> 05:25.700]  We give them $100 in cash and prizes.
[05:25.700 --> 05:27.700]  We feed them.
[05:27.700 --> 05:31.700]  We give them medicated cookies, medicated barbecue ribs, chicken.
[05:31.700 --> 05:40.700]  We're eventually going to move to live music, but we give away genetics, soil, nutrients, just grow gear, everything.
[05:40.700 --> 05:48.700]  So you basically hold big parties at cannabis-friendly venues and invite veterans that are in need, get them out of their house, put a smile on their face.
[05:48.700 --> 05:49.700]  Absolutely.
[05:49.700 --> 05:51.700]  Instead of ignoring them like a lot of society has chosen to do.
[05:51.700 --> 05:52.700]  Right.
[05:52.700 --> 06:06.700]  And the way it works is I get companies and other organizations involved and they make a donation to where it's what they provide as a product to the industry.
[06:06.700 --> 06:08.700]  And so they give it away.
[06:08.700 --> 06:13.700]  And basically, we're going to probably have around $40,000 in genetics to give away.
[06:13.700 --> 06:15.700]  I mean, it's serious.
[06:15.700 --> 06:16.700]  That's amazing.
[06:16.700 --> 06:19.700]  Do you want to list off some of the people that are helping out with that event?
[06:19.700 --> 06:20.700]  Yes.
[06:20.700 --> 06:21.700]  Let me pull it up real quick.
[06:21.700 --> 06:22.700]  Take your time.
[06:22.700 --> 06:26.700]  And dude, thank you for doing what you do for the veterans and also for being a veteran.
[06:26.700 --> 06:30.700]  Steve is a veteran, which is what inspired him to be so proactive for his fellows.
[06:30.700 --> 06:37.700]  I'm sure we've talked about it on the show, but Steve's got a hole in his back from taking an IED, right?
[06:37.700 --> 06:38.700]  EFP.
[06:38.700 --> 06:39.700]  EFP.
[06:39.700 --> 06:40.700]  Right.
[06:40.700 --> 06:41.700]  I'll learn all these terms.
[06:41.700 --> 06:42.700]  There's so many military words to them.
[06:42.700 --> 06:43.700]  There's a lot.
[06:43.700 --> 06:44.700]  Yeah.
[06:44.700 --> 06:45.700]  Technically, he got blowed the fuck up.
[06:46.700 --> 06:51.700]  He's got a hole in his back about kidney height that is seriously, you could hide a baseball in there.
[06:51.700 --> 06:53.700]  You could smuggle a baseball in that hole.
[06:53.700 --> 06:54.700]  Put Wilson in there.
[06:54.700 --> 06:56.700]  Always have a friend, bro.
[06:56.700 --> 06:59.700]  I love that you've got a good positive attitude about it now.
[06:59.700 --> 07:00.700]  Right.
[07:00.700 --> 07:02.700]  I'm pretty sure that took a man's attitude.
[07:02.700 --> 07:05.700]  It took about seven and a half years to really pull out of it.
[07:05.700 --> 07:06.700]  Lots of therapy.
[07:06.700 --> 07:10.700]  And then, you know, just lots of good cannabis helps as well.
[07:10.700 --> 07:11.700]  Lots of good friends.
[07:11.700 --> 07:12.700]  Absolutely.
[07:12.700 --> 07:16.700]  A good support system is what was really important for my recovery.
[07:16.700 --> 07:19.700]  I'm proud of you, bro.
[07:19.700 --> 07:21.700]  Not to sound like a cheesy bro, but it's fucking awesome.
[07:21.700 --> 07:22.700]  Oh, man.
[07:22.700 --> 07:23.700]  I appreciate it.
[07:23.700 --> 07:26.700]  A lot of people get blowed the fuck up and go the opposite way, and that's who you're trying to help.
[07:26.700 --> 07:27.700]  Yeah, man.
[07:27.700 --> 07:28.700]  Let's get to the sponsors.

[09:26.700 --> 09:27.700]  What's up, Jim?
[09:27.700 --> 09:30.700]  Then we got Nectar for the Gods, which is sponsoring all the soil and nutrients.
[09:30.700 --> 09:34.700]  You shared some cannabis that you grew with Nectar of the Gods,
[09:34.700 --> 09:36.700]  and I'll agree, that was godlike.
[09:36.700 --> 09:37.700]  It's pretty good, isn't it?
[09:37.700 --> 09:39.700]  Was that Sunset Sherbet you gave me?
[09:39.700 --> 09:43.700]  Yes, Sunset Sherbet, and then we smoked Heart of Gold and then something else.
[09:43.700 --> 09:45.700]  Of course, good job on the Heart of Gold.
[09:45.700 --> 09:47.700]  You've been growing the shit out of that one for a minute,
[09:47.700 --> 09:49.700]  and of course that's my genetic, so I always love tasting it
[09:49.700 --> 09:51.700]  and seeing what happens with that.
[09:51.700 --> 09:54.700]  But that Sunset, I enjoyed that more than the Heart of Gold, to tell you the truth.
[09:54.700 --> 09:56.700]  The flavor on that was so bold.
[09:56.700 --> 09:57.700]  Thanks, man.
[09:57.700 --> 10:01.700]  I described it in my head as if you take a purple Laffy Taffy
[10:01.700 --> 10:04.700]  and hold it in your mouth for a couple of minutes and let it start to melt,
[10:04.700 --> 10:06.700]  I think that's kind of what that would taste like.
[10:06.700 --> 10:07.700]  So good work on that, bro.
[10:07.700 --> 10:09.700]  Thank you, I really appreciate it.
[10:09.700 --> 10:11.700]  I just love to grow cannabis.
[10:11.700 --> 10:13.700]  It's just my favorite thing in the world.
[10:13.700 --> 10:15.700]  I wish you could see Steve's face right now,
[10:15.700 --> 10:17.700]  because he just lit up like a little kid on Christmas.
[10:17.700 --> 10:19.700]  It's like someone just showed him boobs.
[10:19.700 --> 10:20.700]  He's like, I love to grow cannabis.
[10:20.700 --> 10:21.700]  He's got a huge smile.
[10:21.700 --> 10:22.700]  Buds.
[10:22.700 --> 10:23.700]  Yeah.
[10:23.700 --> 10:25.700]  They're in my face all day.
[10:25.700 --> 10:26.700]  Nose.
[10:26.700 --> 10:27.700]  I'm happy about it.
[10:27.700 --> 10:28.700]  I love it, it's great.
[10:28.700 --> 10:30.700]  When is this Veteran Farmers Alliance event happening?
[10:30.700 --> 10:32.700]  It's going to be Friday, November 11th on Veterans Day.
[10:32.700 --> 10:34.700]  Perfect, it couldn't do any better than that.
[10:34.700 --> 10:37.700]  Friday, November 11th, Veterans Day at the Dab Lounge, right?
[10:37.700 --> 10:38.700]  That's correct.
[10:38.700 --> 10:39.700]  In Colorado Springs.
[10:39.700 --> 10:41.700]  What's the address there, do you remember offhand?
[10:41.700 --> 10:43.700]  It's 1532 North Circle, I believe.
[10:43.700 --> 10:44.700]  Good job, that sounds accurate to me.
[10:44.700 --> 10:46.700]  I would say that's right.
[10:46.700 --> 10:49.700]  Are non-veterans invited as well as veterans?
[10:49.700 --> 10:51.700]  Yes, but it is $50 to get in.
[10:51.700 --> 10:52.700]  Okay.
[10:52.700 --> 10:56.700]  And what that does is that goes to the donation for my 501,
[10:56.700 --> 10:59.700]  to basically get the application, get the bylaws written,
[10:59.700 --> 11:01.700]  get it rolling and going,
[11:02.700 --> 11:06.700]  and then, yeah, then I can actually do a whole lot more,
[11:06.700 --> 11:09.700]  which is going to be the next three to five years is going to be
[11:09.700 --> 11:10.700]  something really crazy.
[11:10.700 --> 11:11.700]  We've got a plan.
[11:11.700 --> 11:13.700]  We're going to talk about that in a minute, I think.
[11:13.700 --> 11:14.700]  Absolutely.
[11:14.700 --> 11:16.700]  So the Veteran Farmers Alliance event at the Dab Lounge,
[11:16.700 --> 11:17.700]  make sure you guys come.
[11:17.700 --> 11:18.700]  He said it's $50, don't be scared.
[11:18.700 --> 11:21.700]  You heard of all of those companies that donated products.
[11:21.700 --> 11:25.700]  Are the non-veterans that show up and pay the $50 entry fee eligible
[11:25.700 --> 11:26.700]  for those raffles?
[11:26.700 --> 11:27.700]  Yes.
[11:27.700 --> 11:28.700]  Yes.
[11:28.700 --> 11:30.700]  You guys, I won two prizes last time.
[11:30.700 --> 11:33.700]  I won a jar of weed and then my second prize was a grinder.
[11:33.700 --> 11:35.700]  So you can't go any better than that.
[11:35.700 --> 11:36.700]  Right.
[11:36.700 --> 11:37.700]  Yeah.
[11:37.700 --> 11:38.700]  You walk in and win something.
[11:38.700 --> 11:39.700]  You're happy.
[11:39.700 --> 11:40.700]  I got blazed out of my mind.
[11:40.700 --> 11:41.700]  I had a hood.
[11:41.700 --> 11:42.700]  I got a hoodie from our friend Fox.
[11:42.700 --> 11:43.700]  Yeah.
[11:43.700 --> 11:44.700]  Okay.
[11:44.700 --> 11:45.700]  I got a whole bunch of great things.
[11:45.700 --> 11:46.700]  It was a good time.
[11:46.700 --> 11:47.700]  All right.
[11:47.700 --> 11:49.700]  So you mentioned trying to raise money.
[11:49.700 --> 11:54.700]  The contributions will go to raise money for your new 501 K C.
[11:54.700 --> 11:55.700]  It's three C.
[11:55.700 --> 11:56.700]  Okay.
[11:56.700 --> 11:57.700]  C3 or three C.
[11:57.700 --> 11:58.700]  I forget how it goes.
[11:58.700 --> 11:59.700]  I don't.
[11:59.700 --> 12:00.700]  It's just, it's been crazy.
[12:00.700 --> 12:01.700]  I got so much going on.
[12:01.700 --> 12:02.700]  It's like, now I got to get this.
[12:02.700 --> 12:03.700]  And I'm like, it's a what, what?
[12:03.700 --> 12:04.700]  The internet will help you out.
[12:04.700 --> 12:05.700]  Oh yeah.
[12:05.700 --> 12:06.700]  There's got to be, what's that?
[12:06.700 --> 12:07.700]  What's that legal zoom.
[12:07.700 --> 12:08.700]  Go to legal zoom.
[12:08.700 --> 12:09.700]  Yeah.
[12:09.700 --> 12:10.700]  Yeah.
[12:10.700 --> 12:11.700]  That's what I was looking at.
[12:11.700 --> 12:12.700]  It's probably going to be about, I think anywhere from a thousand to 1100.
[12:12.700 --> 12:13.700]  And then I got to go to score and then they'll do all the help me with the bylaws.
[12:13.700 --> 12:14.700]  And once that's going, then I just want it to all be legit for everybody.
[12:14.700 --> 12:15.700]  There's a cap.
[12:15.700 --> 12:16.700]  Nobody will make hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[12:16.700 --> 12:17.700]  It'll be like, oh, I'm going to get a $50.
[12:17.700 --> 12:18.700]  I'm going to get a $50.
[12:18.700 --> 12:41.140]  I mean, that's once we're having, we have to establish people to hire on to travel around
[12:41.140 --> 12:43.260]  and, and help put these events on.
[12:43.260 --> 12:46.540]  Cause we want to, instead of doing two a year, we want to do one every month.
[12:46.540 --> 12:47.540]  So, oh wow.
[12:47.540 --> 12:51.300]  And different locations to get more veterans in more cities, more supplies to grow their
[12:51.300 --> 12:52.300]  own cannabis.
[12:52.300 --> 12:53.300]  And then we go national.
[12:53.300 --> 12:57.700]  So eventually we're going to, if we take in, once we start taking in a large amount and
[12:57.700 --> 13:03.500]  it's like, well, I need to start hiring people to start expanding, then their cap is 22 grand,
[13:03.500 --> 13:04.500]  not 800 grand.
[13:04.500 --> 13:05.500]  Okay.
[13:05.500 --> 13:06.780]  I'll keep it modest for people.
[13:06.780 --> 13:07.780]  I like that.
[13:07.780 --> 13:08.780]  Yeah.
[13:08.780 --> 13:11.220]  It's like, if you're here to do this for the veteran farmers Alliance or for other organizations,
[13:11.220 --> 13:13.420]  no, this is just for veteran farmers Alliance.
[13:13.420 --> 13:14.420]  Okay.
[13:14.420 --> 13:18.740]  So the whole point is if you're coming to work, like even me, if I, if I don't even
[13:18.740 --> 13:25.380]  know if I'm going to even take the money, but the whole point is it's, it's guys that
[13:25.380 --> 13:26.860]  need something to do.
[13:26.860 --> 13:28.140]  It's we take them out.
[13:28.140 --> 13:31.700]  We take that donation instead of putting in our pocket, right?
[13:31.700 --> 13:34.460]  The whole nonprofit.
[13:34.460 --> 13:35.580]  What we do is we'll take that.
[13:35.580 --> 13:38.620]  We'll take them out on like fishing trips, hunting trips.
[13:38.620 --> 13:41.380]  We'll take them out on backpacking tricks trips.
[13:41.380 --> 13:42.620]  We'll take them down to Peru.
[13:42.620 --> 13:47.380]  It's more therapeutic than any kind of hospital visit or psychology or having a friend to
[13:47.380 --> 13:51.700]  go hang out and smoke some herbs and I mean, eventually you'll have your camp healing,
[13:51.700 --> 13:52.700]  right?
[13:52.700 --> 13:55.220]  And eventually we're going to get acreage where we can just do this.
[13:55.220 --> 13:59.980]  Guys can come out for a week and just reset, hunt, fish camp, veteran farmers Alliance
[13:59.980 --> 14:00.980]  camping trip.
[14:00.980 --> 14:03.220]  That sounds great, but it's on our own land.
[14:03.220 --> 14:04.220]  So it'd be private land.
[14:04.220 --> 14:07.340]  You can come out and just relax, just decompress.
[14:07.340 --> 14:08.340]  Some guys need that.
[14:08.340 --> 14:11.220]  They just need a reset, you know, a little quiet space away from the fireworks.
[14:11.820 --> 14:13.700]  This episode will come out right before the 4th of July.
[14:13.700 --> 14:15.900]  You guys respect the veterans on the 4th of July.
[14:15.900 --> 14:20.220]  If you know that somebody that lives next door on your block is a combat veteran, go
[14:20.220 --> 14:23.740]  ask them if they're cool with fireworks and if they're not, don't light them.
[14:23.740 --> 14:25.140]  Go somewhere else and watch the show.
[14:25.140 --> 14:26.660]  Like don't, don't freak people out.
[14:26.660 --> 14:29.140]  I've, I've seen, I see a lot of stuff on Facebook about it.
[14:29.140 --> 14:30.140]  Please respect the veterans.
[14:30.140 --> 14:33.540]  I do not agree with war, but these are humans.
[14:33.540 --> 14:35.820]  Uh, you got to respect them either way.
[14:35.820 --> 14:38.980]  And believe it or not, that shit sounds exactly like it from a distance.
[14:38.980 --> 14:39.980]  Oh yeah.
[14:40.220 --> 14:43.900]  I mean, even up close, I mean, it's just, there was last year was the first year I ever
[14:43.900 --> 14:46.940]  went to the 4th of July in eight years.
[14:46.940 --> 14:51.300]  And it was, yeah, it was like, I was like, man, okay, I can do this.
[14:51.300 --> 14:52.300]  And I just reminded me a lot.
[14:52.300 --> 14:55.340]  I was like, all right, yeah, that sounds like it, but I know it's not real.
[14:55.340 --> 14:58.860]  And I'm just, my wife's asking me every time I see, okay, you okay?
[14:58.860 --> 14:59.860]  I'm like, yeah, I'm good.
[14:59.860 --> 15:01.860]  I'm like, I think I'll be all right.
[15:01.860 --> 15:06.300]  And that was kind of the last year about this time is when I first started taking the steps
[15:06.300 --> 15:07.300]  to recovering.
[15:08.180 --> 15:10.900]  And uh, yeah, it's been a quick process ever since then too.
[15:10.900 --> 15:14.220]  So I've known you basically through the whole come through process, right?
[15:14.220 --> 15:15.220]  Wow.
[15:15.220 --> 15:21.260]  I didn't realize you were that new or new freshly out of your, uh, your, I don't know,
[15:21.260 --> 15:22.260]  your trauma.
[15:22.260 --> 15:23.260]  Right.
[15:23.260 --> 15:24.260]  I don't know the word for it, but you know what?
[15:24.260 --> 15:25.260]  I just got tired of it.
[15:25.260 --> 15:26.820]  I got tired of being in my head all the time.
[15:26.820 --> 15:27.820]  I got tired of isolating.
[15:27.820 --> 15:31.380]  I got tired of being this fucking asshole all the time.
[15:31.380 --> 15:36.140]  And it just got to the point where I was like, fuck, I gotta just do something about this.
[15:36.140 --> 15:38.380]  And my wife was going to leave me, I was going to lose my house.
[15:38.380 --> 15:40.260]  I was like, I can't do this.
[15:40.260 --> 15:41.980]  So I just said, fuck it.
[15:41.980 --> 15:45.020]  I'm not going to be trapped in my head anymore.
[15:45.020 --> 15:49.860]  And we found a good therapist, started doing EMDR and I started using cannabis with, I
[15:49.860 --> 15:50.860]  don't know what it's called.
[15:50.860 --> 15:51.860]  I don't know what it's called.
[15:51.860 --> 15:54.860]  We had to look it up the other day on Tok Radio too.
[15:54.860 --> 15:56.940]  I bet Jay knows.
[15:56.940 --> 15:57.940]  We should message Jay.
[15:57.940 --> 16:00.220]  Shout out to our friend Jay Daly at Tok Radio.com.
[16:00.220 --> 16:03.900]  You guys, you can hear this podcast every Wednesday at 1pm on Tok Radio.
[16:04.660 --> 16:06.060]  Those are some cool guys up there.
[16:06.060 --> 16:07.060]  Yeah, Jay's a great guy.
[16:07.060 --> 16:11.340]  I haven't gotten on his show in his studio yet, but he runs my show on his network.
[16:11.340 --> 16:12.340]  So that is super friendly.
[16:12.340 --> 16:13.500]  I need to go hang out with Jay.
[16:13.500 --> 16:14.780]  Jay, if you're listening, invite me up.
[16:14.780 --> 16:16.220]  I'd love to be on your show.
[16:16.220 --> 16:20.260]  I'd like to come and do your show and Lucy's show on the same day in one trip to Denver.
[16:20.260 --> 16:21.260]  That'd be awesome.
[16:21.260 --> 16:23.060]  Yeah, Jay's a good guy.
[16:23.060 --> 16:24.060]  Really cool guy.
[16:24.060 --> 16:27.060]  I like hanging out with him at events, giving him dabs.
[16:27.060 --> 16:33.140]  Man, he said, dude, this hash on the table, that hash over there, Jay said that this was
[16:33.140 --> 16:34.820]  the best hash he's ever dabbed.
[16:34.820 --> 16:35.820]  Ever.
[16:35.820 --> 16:36.820]  Who grew the product?
[16:36.820 --> 16:37.820]  That was me.
[16:37.820 --> 16:38.820]  You grew it.
[16:38.820 --> 16:39.820]  Who ran the extraction?
[16:39.820 --> 16:40.820]  I did the extraction.
[16:40.820 --> 16:41.820]  Good work, man.
[16:41.820 --> 16:42.820]  I took a dab of it.
[16:42.820 --> 16:43.820]  Duax, no grin.
[16:43.820 --> 16:44.820]  It's beautiful.
[16:44.820 --> 16:47.940]  Unfortunately, I can't give you best I've ever smoked.
[16:47.940 --> 16:50.900]  I can remember one of my favorites.
[16:50.900 --> 16:58.460]  The very first secret cup in Denver, entry number 23, Kyle Cushman's veganic strawberry
[16:58.460 --> 16:59.460]  cough.
[16:59.460 --> 17:03.660]  Best dabs I've ever, ever dabbed.
[17:03.660 --> 17:05.540]  Shout out for Jay saying that this was the best.
[17:05.540 --> 17:07.580]  I wish I still had that strain.
[17:07.580 --> 17:08.580]  Yeah.
[17:08.580 --> 17:11.540]  Everybody wants that old school Kyle Cushman cut.
[17:11.540 --> 17:13.980]  Yeah, he's very, very talented.
[17:13.980 --> 17:16.140]  I hope one day I can be at that level.
[17:16.140 --> 17:17.140]  Kyle?
[17:17.140 --> 17:18.140]  Yeah.
[17:18.140 --> 17:19.140]  You're there, bro.
[17:19.140 --> 17:20.140]  Am I?
[17:20.140 --> 17:21.140]  You're on your way.
[17:21.140 --> 17:22.140]  If you're not there, you're on your way.
[17:22.140 --> 17:23.140]  Oh, you know, I think I got a few more years under my belt.
[17:23.140 --> 17:25.300]  He presents it differently, but I'm sure you've got all that in your head.
[17:25.300 --> 17:29.140]  I just, well, you know, combining our knowledge, John's knowledge with mine, I think we're
[17:29.140 --> 17:30.140]  going to do some pretty cool stuff.
[17:30.140 --> 17:31.140]  Oh yeah.
[17:31.140 --> 17:32.140]  Yeah.
[17:32.140 --> 17:34.260]  I've smoked a bunch of hash that this guy's, that John has made and it is always quality.
[17:34.260 --> 17:35.260]  Thank you.
[17:35.260 --> 17:37.460]  I always like somebody who enjoys my products.
[17:37.460 --> 17:38.460]  Yeah.
[17:38.460 --> 17:39.460]  I smoke a lot of hash.
[17:39.460 --> 17:40.460]  I've seen some boo-boo and I noticed.
[17:40.460 --> 17:41.460]  Yeah.
[17:41.460 --> 17:42.460]  I've noticed.
[17:42.460 --> 17:43.460]  I like to take like half gram, gram dabs or so.
[17:43.460 --> 17:44.460]  I try not to do it too much when I'm at people's houses and in public.
[17:44.460 --> 17:45.460]  I just try to behave myself.
[17:45.460 --> 17:46.460]  Yeah.
[17:46.460 --> 17:47.460]  That definitely alters a person's mind a little bit.
[17:47.460 --> 17:48.460]  Half gram.
[17:48.460 --> 17:49.460]  Damn.
[17:49.460 --> 17:50.460]  I really like to go to the candy candy or somewhere where there's a bunch of people.
[17:50.460 --> 18:02.620]  I just walk in after work and just drop a half gram dab on the email and people look
[18:02.620 --> 18:03.620]  at you like, but did, are you okay?
[18:03.620 --> 18:04.620]  I just got off work.
[18:04.620 --> 18:05.620]  What's wrong?
[18:05.620 --> 18:06.620]  It's whatever.
[18:06.620 --> 18:07.620]  They're like, you didn't even cough.
[18:07.620 --> 18:08.620]  I'm like, why would I cough?
[18:08.620 --> 18:09.620]  I just took a dab.
[18:09.620 --> 18:10.620]  I'll do this all day.
[18:10.620 --> 18:11.620]  Come on guys.
[18:11.620 --> 18:12.620]  I just got off work.
[18:12.620 --> 18:13.620]  Don't you take a fat dab after work?
[18:13.620 --> 18:14.620]  I smoke a big fat joint.
[18:14.620 --> 18:15.620]  Well, I don't work, but.
[18:15.620 --> 18:16.620]  You work all day, bro.
[18:16.620 --> 18:17.620]  I do.
[18:17.620 --> 18:18.620]  I do.
[18:18.620 --> 18:19.620]  I do.
[18:19.620 --> 18:20.620]  You take care of veterans and some, maybe keeping your own head straight sometimes is
[18:20.620 --> 18:21.620]  plenty of work for you.
[18:21.620 --> 18:22.620]  Sometimes it's video games too, though.
[18:22.620 --> 18:23.620]  As a combat veteran with PTSD, can you play combat style video games?
[18:23.620 --> 18:24.620]  Oh yeah.
[18:24.620 --> 18:25.620]  Oh yeah.
[18:25.620 --> 18:26.620]  Now, now if like my wife or kid come, I'm like, go away.
[18:26.620 --> 18:27.620]  And they're kind of like, dude, don't be a dick.
[18:27.620 --> 18:28.620]  And I'm kind of like, yeah, you're right.
[18:28.620 --> 18:29.620]  And I get off and I'm just like, that's the only, that's the only thing it does to me.
[18:29.620 --> 18:30.620]  But warrior mode, right.
[18:30.620 --> 18:31.620]  You know, it kind of like puts you back into the mind of a warrior.
[18:31.620 --> 18:32.620]  And I'm like, I'm not a warrior.
[18:32.620 --> 18:33.620]  I'm just a kid.
[18:33.620 --> 18:34.620]  I'm just a kid.
[18:34.620 --> 18:35.620]  I'm just a kid.
[18:35.620 --> 18:36.620]  I'm just a kid.
[18:36.620 --> 18:37.620]  I'm just a kid.
[20:07.120 --> 20:08.120]  Yeah.
[20:08.120 --> 20:09.120]  Uh, well open.
[20:09.120 --> 20:10.120]  Sims was popular.
[20:10.120 --> 20:13.100]  I would show up at work and my friends would be like, did you stay up all night playing
[20:13.100 --> 20:14.100]  the Sims?
[20:14.100 --> 20:17.100]  And I'd be like, yes, you care more about your Sims than you do you.
[20:17.100 --> 20:19.740]  And that's when I was like, you're right.
[20:19.740 --> 20:20.740]  Right.
[20:20.740 --> 20:21.740]  Right now.
[20:21.740 --> 20:23.500]  And I have to check this problem.
[20:23.500 --> 20:27.060]  So the next time I moved, I got rid of all my gaming consoles.
[20:27.060 --> 20:30.540]  And I try really hard not to put games in my new computer.
[20:30.540 --> 20:31.540]  It's addicted.
[20:31.540 --> 20:35.440]  You I've been able to talk to how many there's too many people to name off
[20:38.620 --> 20:40.500]  Podcast
[20:40.500 --> 20:43.100]  You guys might hear some dogs in the background guys
[20:43.540 --> 20:45.740]  They're very friendly. I met them at the door Scott
[20:45.740 --> 20:50.860]  I mean I talked to him a lot on on social media Scott Ostrander that owns nectar for the gods, okay?
[20:50.900 --> 20:55.920]  He's just he's awesome to talk to there's just so many good people and on Facebook, and yeah
[20:55.920 --> 21:01.260]  There's a lot of drama too, but you can see that's what the follow buttons were right or the block button or the block button
[21:01.260 --> 21:06.140]  Yeah, I'm strong with the floor good to meet you. I don't game with the red golden green collar
[21:15.380 --> 21:19.460]  So we were kind of in the middle of talking about the VFA and the upcoming event helping veterans
[21:19.460 --> 21:23.140]  I'm not exactly sure where we jumped off the deep end on this one, but we got on a pothead rant
[21:23.140 --> 21:27.900]  Oh, yeah, it's all good. We use a hashtag on the podcast. That's hashtag. They like it when we ramble
[21:28.100 --> 21:31.180]  So they know what to expect when they listen to this show
[21:31.820 --> 21:36.340]  I'm pretty sure we basically wrapped up the VFA all right so now
[21:36.860 --> 21:40.680]  We're gonna have a camp for these veterans to go hang out and Medicaid and get away
[21:40.680 --> 21:43.140]  We jumped off on fireworks is how I got on a tangent
[21:43.140 --> 21:48.020]  So you got a place for the veterans to go get away and be away from everything and Medicaid properly and hang out with other
[21:48.140 --> 21:54.220]  Veterans and vent and be cool and the cannabis is free everything's free very cool everything everything everything
[21:54.340 --> 22:00.740]  Is there a limited number of seats or how you gonna keep that I don't know yeah, we got to get there first logistics
[22:00.740 --> 22:01.460]  Yeah
[22:01.460 --> 22:05.260]  Long term plans. I think once we get two years and what we're doing now
[22:05.260 --> 22:09.740]  We have the funds to really start looking. I think that's when we'll start sitting down and really
[22:11.140 --> 22:17.700]  Okay, that makes good sense I admire what you're trying to do. That's awesome all right, so what was the CEC right?
[22:17.700 --> 22:19.540]  There's a CVC
[22:19.540 --> 22:21.540]  Colorado Veterans Collective so
[22:22.380 --> 22:25.000]  So basically City Council limits
[22:25.780 --> 22:30.620]  Colorado Springs now and all of El Paso County on a 12-plan count limit no matter what
[22:30.900 --> 22:33.900]  So even if you have a medical marijuana card from a doctor
[22:35.740 --> 22:42.020]  Is that upholdable in court oh it will if you go to if you go up to like Denver court cats, too
[22:43.740 --> 22:46.620]  What's up kitty on the show that's the first cat that's my rag
[22:46.940 --> 22:51.340]  She's really nice, but she's loud as well. Oh you guys will hear a cat and dogs on this show
[22:51.740 --> 22:57.540]  You'll lose in El Paso County you'll lose and you'll lose in the Colorado Springs if you get bus in Colorado Springs you lose in
[22:57.540 --> 22:59.540]  Colorado Springs you lose in El Paso County
[22:59.660 --> 23:03.260]  Until you got to go up to Denver. That's when you go to Denver you win right?
[23:03.260 --> 23:07.640]  Then you've already spent your life savings right and they've already taken everything away from you, okay
[23:07.640 --> 23:12.180]  Do they take it down when they bust you now? I don't know or they let you go through court before I mean
[23:12.180 --> 23:14.180]  I have no idea. I don't want to get there
[23:15.180 --> 23:21.100]  When they when I heard them really when I heard them start doing raids, I just pretty much cut everything down
[23:21.100 --> 23:23.860]  I'm like okay rooms done a family right well
[23:23.860 --> 23:29.940]  Yeah, and I know I've had a cut down to like an eighth. I used to smoke. I mean what you saw me smoke tonight
[23:29.940 --> 23:32.980]  I'll smoke you know eight grams right and that's that we used to
[23:38.500 --> 23:43.820]  On this podcast it wouldn't be a surprise to smoke eight grams in an episode or when one day at all
[23:43.820 --> 23:45.820]  Right, we're way behind
[23:45.980 --> 23:51.580]  Down to like an eighth maybe maybe maybe two and a half grams a day just to not run out
[23:51.900 --> 23:55.660]  So we started this is so my buddy called me because he knew I was frustrated
[23:56.100 --> 23:58.460]  And he's like man you got to call this other guy
[23:58.460 --> 24:05.260]  he's like he will tell you how to do it and get into the industry where you can be legit a hundred percent and
[24:06.300 --> 24:12.680]  You can operate to where you can still help veterans you can help them in a way where you couldn't do it before which was
[24:12.680 --> 24:13.920]  I can
[24:13.920 --> 24:20.640]  Recuperate the cost through my labor right so I can do that and then also now I can re
[24:23.280 --> 24:27.000]  What's what's the word I would say I can
[24:31.240 --> 24:34.800]  So basically I can resupply the VFA with free cannabis
[24:35.320 --> 24:41.000]  Okay, donations from the CBC right so now we're all in-house to where this is going okay?
[24:41.000 --> 24:47.600]  So now we're keeping everything in-house. It's all quality controlled. We know exactly who grew it where it's coming from is the
[24:48.320 --> 24:52.520]  CVC going to be regulated by the Colorado MED no okay?
[24:54.600 --> 24:59.240]  So what we're looking for is basically it's a place where
[25:00.520 --> 25:08.440]  We basically have a warehouse for your six plants because a lot of people you know cannot grow their plants whether they can
[25:08.440 --> 25:14.460]  And just can't in their living space, or they don't have the green thumb to do so or so or the time
[25:15.880 --> 25:19.000]  we are gonna provide a place for their six plants and
[25:19.560 --> 25:27.200]  We'll take care of it for them, and it's just like babysitting them and have it giving them place to grow and then we will
[25:28.280 --> 25:35.440]  Return their product to them and all they have to do is reimburse us for you know our time and our costs and
[25:35.840 --> 25:41.880]  Through that we'll be able to help a lot of people that would normally have to go to another recreational dispensary
[25:43.160 --> 25:47.400]  Or to get a red card we don't have to that we operate according to amendment 64
[25:47.920 --> 25:54.480]  There's we're not operating in any gray or worse what amendment 64 says is what we are doing and for that
[25:54.480 --> 25:59.400]  We're we're not sketchy at all and in amendment 64 what it says specifically is
[25:59.920 --> 26:03.720]  It lists out you know personal uses of marijuana
[26:04.240 --> 26:11.200]  You can store you can consume all of these things and in the last section in that
[26:11.320 --> 26:18.680]  Part of the amendment it says that anyone in a Colorado can assist you with any of the things
[26:20.440 --> 26:26.920]  Category so therefore you can have somebody babysitting your plants for you because they are allowed to assist you and grow it right
[26:27.400 --> 26:28.920]  Okay
[26:28.920 --> 26:31.920]  And we love what we do so Steve put his mic down for a minute
[26:34.040 --> 26:38.800]  And we love what we do so why not do this and this is a way for us to be able to provide a service
[26:38.800 --> 26:41.760]  That normally wouldn't be able to be provided right and now
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.800]  You know with this service being the way it's gonna be set up is now we can take in people like we're gonna take in
[26:47.800 --> 26:50.960]  Five interns starting at the beginning of the year for an entire year
[26:50.960 --> 26:56.360]  We're gonna train five veterans up to get into the industry to learn how the process works through the MED
[26:56.520 --> 27:00.400]  Buy their licenses to get into the MED get all that paperwork done
[27:00.400 --> 27:08.280]  So when they're done after that year we bring in master growers like you or your boss or other bosses from different
[27:08.480 --> 27:12.480]  Dispensaries and they get to see stats and paperwork on these guys how consistent they were
[27:12.720 --> 27:18.120]  What they're testing what the tests were on there on their cannabis was and and basically
[27:18.600 --> 27:24.840]  You get to cherry-pick and you get to figure out who's gonna be your new grower, and you get to hire him on the spot
[27:25.200 --> 27:30.240]  So you're making kind of a master grower farm league right that's awesome
[27:30.400 --> 27:32.400]  I like it we want to train these guys
[27:32.840 --> 27:38.360]  So test I mean a lot of these guys need a job or something to do and we can train them as best
[27:38.360 --> 27:43.000]  We can and get them into these positions to keep them busy and in that way
[27:43.680 --> 27:50.880]  We're helping the community even more and they'll get to grow the plots for the veterans that are giving you their plant counts, right?
[27:52.080 --> 27:56.560]  And then you guys are gonna train them right they're gonna trust your guys's growth skills. Well. Thank you
[27:56.560 --> 28:00.080]  I mean, we're literally gonna just tether him to us. We're gonna just take him down the line
[28:00.120 --> 28:05.400]  This is what we do. This is how we do it. This is why we do it and and and it's not oh
[28:05.440 --> 28:10.320]  This is just it's in the book and this is why no this is why we do it from personal experience
[28:10.520 --> 28:14.640]  Here's the book for reference. You know like teaming with microbes teaming with nutrients
[28:14.720 --> 28:17.000]  Those are good books for these guys to read not
[28:17.280 --> 28:23.960]  The the grow Bible when you got one that has like 600 pages right if you're gonna do it like that
[28:23.960 --> 28:27.200]  I mean, that's great, but I'd rather read something
[28:27.760 --> 28:29.760]  And
[28:32.080 --> 28:34.080]  You're actually learning
[28:34.960 --> 28:38.040]  Comprehensive instead of an encyclopedia. This is why it's green
[28:40.040 --> 28:42.040]  Because it works
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.720]  Is just their experience so we're giving these guys experience and
[28:50.480 --> 28:54.940]  Knowledge for free and eventually a job hopefully out of it. That's pretty rad
[28:54.980 --> 29:01.620]  All right, so maybe one day across Colorado there'll be veterans running these grows or across the nation, that's the whole point
[29:01.980 --> 29:04.980]  Once we go federal we're really waiting for it
[29:05.060 --> 29:11.220]  We're really just gonna blow up with it because now we're gonna be the only training facility in the United States
[29:11.500 --> 29:17.660]  That can train people and then send them out anywhere in the United States after one year the dogs think the buds smell great
[29:21.260 --> 29:23.460]  Ziggy stole a bunch of sunset share bird
[29:25.380 --> 29:27.380]  I mean bad dogs don't do that
[29:29.900 --> 29:35.220]  They can just take control of the industry because they're some of the most disciplined hard-working
[29:35.980 --> 29:40.200]  I've been through three people in the growth facility so far that I have not made the cut
[29:40.200 --> 29:42.820]  I think some veterans might be the next on the shopping list
[29:43.660 --> 29:48.100]  Dedicate they just want to work. They need a price you give you give better purpose. He'll go a long way with you
[29:48.140 --> 29:49.820]  He's loyal
[29:49.940 --> 29:53.780]  He just he wants he wants to to be a part of something right
[29:56.340 --> 30:02.940]  I like it. Is there somebody on your guys's team that knows how to build a good commercial size grow to keep everything that you're
[30:02.940 --> 30:07.180]  Trying to do sustainable. I would say between John and I we have it covered
[30:14.620 --> 30:17.660]  What's ever already on the land that you buy that's right I can make holes
[30:19.820 --> 30:22.180]  He's waiting on yeah, we're waiting
[30:23.180 --> 30:30.460]  His wife got cancer. We have the land we need a building for this collective and that's going that's going up here pretty soon
[30:30.460 --> 30:38.620]  No, so right and engineers carry come out surveyed the land. We're ready to go like they can literally dump the concrete tomorrow
[30:40.700 --> 30:42.180]  Facility up within
[30:42.180 --> 30:47.940]  What six weeks after that yeah, and I've been working with Cavita's for a while and this whole last year
[30:47.940 --> 30:54.260]  I've been focusing on grow room design and you know maximizing yields through that so I think that
[30:55.100 --> 30:58.300]  after a year of focusing on that we can create
[30:59.420 --> 31:02.060]  Create the grow that we need to be able to provide
[31:02.780 --> 31:05.460]  Medicine for these guys at the cheapest cost possible
[31:05.660 --> 31:12.140]  It's good to see the owners and founders and CEOs of a grow be the people that are gonna be in there getting their hands
[31:12.140 --> 31:14.900]  Dirty because too often in the regulated industry
[31:15.500 --> 31:22.060]  There are guys that own big businesses that just want to make more money and they buy into the cannabis industry and then the growers are
[31:22.540 --> 31:24.540]  forced to
[31:24.780 --> 31:28.460]  Just they have to face conditions and do things they would have to
[31:29.300 --> 31:35.260]  Compromise their integrity and a grow often right because the owner doesn't want to spend the extra money to do it the way it should
[31:35.260 --> 31:40.140]  Be so it's good to see and I'm not calling anybody out my facility. I read a shopping list and it shows up
[31:40.140 --> 31:42.140]  I
[31:44.620 --> 31:48.980]  Write down a shopping list and take a picture of it and send it to him and then the next day when he comes in
[31:48.980 --> 31:52.860]  All that shit shows up like he's like you don't need to be shopping and doing shit like that
[31:52.860 --> 31:54.860]  You need to be growing cannabis
[31:54.940 --> 31:58.100]  Yeah, shout out to John Hunt for all that the love that you go to the store for me, bro
[31:58.100 --> 32:00.860]  That helps me out get those co2 tanks filled. They're sitting in the room waiting for you
[32:01.060 --> 32:06.660]  But too many facilities have a lead guy that is just throwing dollars at somebody that doesn't care
[32:06.660 --> 32:08.740]  But they don't even smoke. That's what I was gonna say
[32:09.180 --> 32:11.500]  I worked at a facility. I love that. We agreed
[32:11.500 --> 32:11.820]  I
[32:11.820 --> 32:18.020]  Were I was employed by one facility where all of the upper management were snobs about hating potheads
[32:18.220 --> 32:21.020]  Like they made fun of me because I was high all the time
[32:25.660 --> 32:30.460]  Because on my lunch break I go in and spend half my paycheck and then I go home and enjoy it and come back and
[32:30.660 --> 32:34.820]  Yeah, you shouldn't be mad at us potheads. We're making a rich, bro. We bought that new Hummer
[32:35.820 --> 32:42.260]  Hummer the other part about this is none of this is about making money. We all will have you know, our you know
[32:42.540 --> 32:46.260]  Necessities taken care of and stuff, but nobody's gonna get rich out of this, you know
[32:46.900 --> 32:50.660]  Like the only way this room looks like they really want to be blingy rich
[32:52.620 --> 32:54.620]  We just want to grow really good cannabis
[32:57.620 --> 32:59.620]  In almost any conditions
[32:59.620 --> 33:06.860]  Colorado yeah, yeah, that's it. I mean we're gonna it's gonna be at least a 45-minute drive for me from my house to the facility
[33:06.860 --> 33:11.500]  So I just need something that's really talking to my bro. Sorry. Oh, sir. Yeah, you're good. I got most of that
[33:11.500 --> 33:14.820]  Okay, I just need I just noticed reliable and that's really it. I
[33:15.700 --> 33:17.220]  Like it
[33:17.220 --> 33:23.740]  Trying to grow cannabis for veterans. Yeah. All right. So how long until this will realistically be going the collective?
[33:24.340 --> 33:27.900]  We're thinking that we can get the guy to move the damn building, right?
[33:28.340 --> 33:31.940]  And if that happens we're thinking we'll have our facility built in
[33:34.380 --> 33:40.720]  September early mid-september mid late September mid late September whatever you know plans first October in there
[33:42.140 --> 33:43.780]  October's
[33:43.780 --> 33:51.180]  drop dead right now. We're waiting on a low lawyer visit and buying our business license for you know our
[33:51.940 --> 33:55.100]  Warehouse facility that we're creating and after that
[33:55.900 --> 34:00.280]  We wait what was it six to eight weeks for that license and then we can start signing people up
[34:00.340 --> 34:03.660]  Once we have the the tax license and all that we're ready to rock and roll
[34:03.660 --> 34:10.160]  We do already have a website up at Colorado veterans collective.com Colorado veterans collective.com
[34:10.160 --> 34:13.340]  Check them out you guys support that put a bunch of clicks on their website share it
[34:13.540 --> 34:18.780]  If you have a veteran friend family member if you're a veteran share that with other veterans go check it out
[34:19.180 --> 34:22.700]  If you're a veteran you should be friends with Steve DeFino on Facebook
[34:23.180 --> 34:25.180]  He likes veterans of all shapes and ages
[34:39.020 --> 34:43.420]  I don't really know you I don't usually I get a lot of weird requests lately
[34:43.420 --> 34:47.740]  Yeah, I've been getting a lot of weird stuff to lately. So I've just been a little more locked out
[34:48.740 --> 34:56.740]  Yeah, but if you go on Facebook veteran farmers Alliance on Facebook and you can go to contact us on our website at the
[34:57.140 --> 35:02.860]  CVC's website and it will email one of us and we can get back to you as quick as we can
[35:03.460 --> 35:05.460]  And when you do contact them
[35:05.460 --> 35:09.080]  Let them know that you heard about him through the grow from your heart podcast because we would all like to know we like
[35:09.080 --> 35:13.780]  To know where the resources came from and where things went who heard what that's a good way to trace things back
[35:13.780 --> 35:18.420]  And then they'll know where the relationship developed and then they'll treat you like a VIP because absolutely
[35:19.220 --> 35:22.340]  I'll take good care of you no matter what absolutely he was always super kind
[35:30.500 --> 35:33.500]  I could kind of read that but you saved the day by fixing the SD card. So we're gonna
[35:33.500 --> 35:35.860]  Give you a good core
[35:46.620 --> 35:51.200]  Me I'll rip your computer apart and put it back together in 30 seconds 30 minutes 30 minutes
[35:51.900 --> 35:53.900]  Do you get a free pizza? If it's not ready?
[35:54.740 --> 35:56.740]  So
[36:00.100 --> 36:06.580]  So basically to to keep our costs low for the CVC I saw that yeah to keep our costs low
[36:06.580 --> 36:12.100]  I'm gonna pass this over to John because he's gonna read off some of the main sponsors that have helped us for the CVC
[36:12.940 --> 36:17.300]  These are for the CVC to get you guys started with your facility in the building in the land
[36:17.380 --> 36:22.380]  Okay, so let's hear it from these guys our first sponsor and the one that makes this
[36:22.940 --> 36:28.380]  Incredibly possible for us to do and cheap for the veterans is nectar for the gods
[36:29.300 --> 36:35.180]  Steve has been growing with nectar for the gods for two years. Yeah, it's like two years now and
[36:36.060 --> 36:39.300]  He's gotten to know the owner really well
[36:40.940 --> 36:42.900]  Yes, and he's been
[36:42.900 --> 36:47.260]  sponsored for a while by them so we went to him with this idea that we had and
[36:47.980 --> 36:54.140]  Steve emailed him or Facebook Tim and asked if he would continue the sponsorship and he agreed with it
[36:54.140 --> 37:00.780]  And so we are getting our nutrients and soil for free which helps us keep the cost down for the veterans
[37:01.460 --> 37:06.660]  The reimbursement fee is planned to be at $100 at first and remember this is recreational
[37:07.180 --> 37:13.580]  At $100 first and every sponsorship we get we can take that chunk out. Our goal is $50
[37:14.260 --> 37:19.320]  Reimbursement because as our cost drops so do the prices because that's what we're doing
[37:19.900 --> 37:22.340]  Yeah, I know we're not in a ghetto, but I do hear fireworks
[37:24.500 --> 37:26.500]  If we were at my house, it would be questionable
[37:28.260 --> 37:30.260]  Yeah our old house as well I
[37:31.740 --> 37:37.180]  Thought Pueblo was bad Colorado Springs is getting there. Oh, I've had some interesting neighbors
[37:37.820 --> 37:41.820]  All right, and let's see what else we got some seed sponsors. We got gonzo seeds
[37:42.820 --> 37:44.940]  Giving us this genetics we need
[37:45.660 --> 37:48.140]  Obviously, we've been on toke radio on Monday
[37:48.500 --> 37:53.900]  They enjoyed our time up there and we will probably be going back. Those guys are really awesome
[37:54.660 --> 37:56.660]  they're going to have our
[37:57.100 --> 38:00.980]  commercials run on their radio show cool we got pollination
[38:02.060 --> 38:05.940]  Steve knows Ryan really well and there they have some killer strains
[38:05.940 --> 38:09.260]  And so they're going to be sending us some of their genetics to work with
[38:10.020 --> 38:12.020]  CB1 analytics
[38:12.100 --> 38:17.700]  Steve got in contact with those guys and a Tuesday and they're gonna be running all of our
[38:18.220 --> 38:23.380]  All of our testing for us for free as well so we can know exactly what we're giving these guys very cool
[38:23.540 --> 38:27.460]  You guys will have some iris genetics in that garden also, of course we will guaranteed
[38:31.220 --> 38:35.140]  I've got some high yielding stuff that you guys will appreciate. Oh, yeah, we love that stuff
[38:39.420 --> 38:45.340]  That's the list we have so far but even with just those we're able to keep the cost down as best we can
[38:46.100 --> 38:51.300]  Everything else we can add on there. We'll just be cutting off and making it cheaper for these guys
[38:51.980 --> 38:56.220]  Yep, every time we can chop at that price to bring it down. It's just a better advantage for these guys
[38:56.260 --> 39:01.180]  so if I were a veteran and I signed my plants over to you and then I wait probably 60 or 90 days so that
[39:01.180 --> 39:03.220]  You could pull my plants down and get a harvest out of them
[39:03.940 --> 39:09.300]  For $100 to start what realistically what amount of medicine can I expect from you?
[39:11.100 --> 39:18.100]  Yes, it depends on the size of the plants we grow but I mean you're thinking three gallons three to five gallon plants
[39:18.740 --> 39:23.660]  Okay, and six of them because that's your legal. Well three three and flower three
[39:26.620 --> 39:28.100]  Okay, and
[39:28.100 --> 39:34.900]  And we'll keep it on a pretty nice rotation for everyone everything will be numbered by patient and everything like that
[39:34.940 --> 39:36.980]  So we'll be able to keep it constant
[39:36.980 --> 39:44.740]  And of course, you know the better we grow the more will come out of each plant. And so eventually they'll be getting
[39:45.860 --> 39:52.260]  Potentially more that then they can actually consume and at that point there they can waive their
[39:52.460 --> 39:59.380]  Cost and give their product back to us and that's where we're gonna be able to start giving away free product through
[40:01.740 --> 40:09.020]  Exactly like that chain of command that's working really well for you. Yeah, there's no loose ends where money or anything just sits around
[40:09.020 --> 40:12.780]  We're always just trying to give back as good as fast as we can
[40:13.540 --> 40:17.980]  Well, it's like, you know City Council when they did the whole 12-point count. It really just broke me
[40:18.300 --> 40:20.940]  Yeah, I was just I was really upset and I was like man
[40:20.940 --> 40:25.340]  There's got to be a way around and that was such a ridiculous way to do it because nobody at that meeting
[40:25.340 --> 40:30.660]  Oh, we've been over this nobody at that meeting wanted that to go through. Yeah, no one not not one person
[40:30.700 --> 40:33.660]  there's four people that one did to go through plus the
[40:34.780 --> 40:40.260]  City Council members and that was about 150 to 200 that were opposed to that measure
[40:40.260 --> 40:42.260]  Passive so many
[40:42.540 --> 40:49.300]  I watched that on the internet and you could even feel the vibe of the room coming from the computer screen
[40:50.060 --> 40:54.020]  As well, I live in another city and I was still paying attention because you guys had me rallied
[40:54.020 --> 40:56.020]  It was four hours of testimony
[40:56.660 --> 41:00.260]  It was 13 minutes. I saw Andrews part. Yeah
[41:01.460 --> 41:03.460]  That was intense. That was great
[41:03.820 --> 41:08.860]  They didn't like you said that there was another bill coming up that you wanted to talk about right?
[41:08.860 --> 41:10.860]  so apparently
[41:11.060 --> 41:17.100]  Somebody's gathered enough signatures to possibly add this to the ballot for this year and it's to limit
[41:17.580 --> 41:24.140]  The percentage of THC in every single product whether it's medical or recreational at 16%
[41:25.340 --> 41:28.780]  16% THC in anything everything so the
[41:29.500 --> 41:31.100]  flower
[41:31.100 --> 41:32.780]  I'm flabbergasted
[41:32.780 --> 41:38.420]  How I would have to get rid of every flower in my garden or cut it down at week five
[41:45.500 --> 41:51.740]  Does that mean this slab of shatter could only test at 16% THC
[41:58.340 --> 42:00.500]  Okay, well I'm pretty sure you're correct with the flower
[42:01.460 --> 42:04.940]  That's I mean if it's if from what I heard last night
[42:04.940 --> 42:10.260]  It was everything and if that's the point whether it's recreational or medical. Well, who the hell's that gonna benefit?
[42:10.260 --> 42:12.460]  It's no longer medical. All right, it's gonna destroy
[42:13.220 --> 42:15.940]  Dispensaries, it's gonna destroy everyone. I mean
[42:17.460 --> 42:19.740]  Do you have to just throw it away probably destroy?
[42:21.260 --> 42:26.500]  And and for that to happen, I mean that's just man that's just wrong such a waste I
[42:27.500 --> 42:33.980]  I'm not a quitter. But if you told me that I couldn't grow cannabis over 16% THC anymore. I might quit well, I'd move
[42:34.340 --> 42:39.780]  Yeah, I just have to move the operation somewhere else. There's no way to really I mean terpenes are great
[42:39.780 --> 42:46.700]  but the only two I mean in in THC is great, but there's the combination of both even in high forms that are
[42:47.620 --> 42:53.460]  Truly beneficial the perfect medicine right there missing either one and it's just gonna be you know
[42:53.580 --> 42:57.460]  Synthesized THC or it's gonna be something blah blah, you know
[42:58.700 --> 43:00.700]  the reasoning behind this idea
[43:01.260 --> 43:03.260]  ignorance
[43:03.260 --> 43:05.020]  Yeah, Wow
[43:05.020 --> 43:07.780]  Somebody trying to control the industry that can't go
[43:08.660 --> 43:09.860]  You know what? I think it is
[43:09.860 --> 43:15.340]  I think I think they make so much money in the black market like busting people in the black market
[43:15.660 --> 43:20.940]  That they're trying to revert it back a little bit so they can just keep going after and just keep nailing
[43:21.180 --> 43:27.140]  That each nail into the coffin just to make it worse to make us criminals again. I'm kind of like I'm flabbergasted
[43:27.140 --> 43:31.140]  I'm like you gave us this and now you want to take it away and they like
[43:35.300 --> 43:40.780]  Right, I mean that's kind of what the government's been lately it's like here take this and they're like, oh just kidding
[43:41.460 --> 43:46.340]  It's like come on. You just made it illegal in a different twist. You can't grow at home
[43:47.340 --> 43:53.540]  Because you are just gonna cause problems and now you can't buy good weed at dispensary so go home and grow your good weed
[43:53.540 --> 43:55.540]  Oh, you can't do that. Yeah
[43:55.620 --> 44:03.300]  Yeah, you can drink and pop all your pills and I just hate to go back to all that but it's like come on man
[44:03.340 --> 44:08.020]  Right. How many people do you see when you're out in Colorado Springs?
[44:08.020 --> 44:11.940]  How many people do you see that are just too high for their own good on cannabis that are causing a problem?
[44:12.740 --> 44:14.740]  None
[44:14.860 --> 44:16.820]  That's I wasn't trying to go there
[44:16.820 --> 44:22.140]  But how many people do you see on a bicycle as soon as the Sun goes down with the fucking headlamp on their forehead?
[44:22.260 --> 44:26.300]  Picking it a sword driving around peeking in every trash can. Oh, yeah everywhere
[44:26.300 --> 44:29.580]  You got to dodge him on your car right now. He's gonna throw something away. They're like, hey
[44:29.580 --> 44:31.580]  Yeah
[44:34.340 --> 44:39.060]  Seriously they're everywhere. You don't want that. I'll eat it donors aren't the problem. That's right
[44:39.060 --> 44:42.460]  Yeah, we're not we're and the ones that are the problem are less than 1%
[44:43.100 --> 44:46.400]  But they're going after them and then punishing the rest of us
[44:46.820 --> 44:51.580]  Making an example out of that one asshole that wasn't even part of the crew that we would have we would have shunned him and
[44:51.700 --> 44:53.700]  Punished him anyway, if we saw his action
[44:53.700 --> 44:55.220]  Absolutely
[44:55.220 --> 44:56.940]  We don't want that in our community
[44:56.940 --> 45:01.860]  We want to be able to support our community and be able to show people that we're in this for the good reasons
[45:01.860 --> 45:03.860]  This isn't the black market. This is
[45:04.220 --> 45:06.860]  This we just need to get rid of this
[45:07.580 --> 45:14.500]  All these regulations just trying to tie us down. I mean, yeah, there's there is too many plants in a house
[45:14.500 --> 45:19.100]  I mean if it's too powerful for the grid, it'll burn the grid up. I get that you'll get a house fire
[45:19.340 --> 45:21.340]  so whatever on that but
[45:21.740 --> 45:26.300]  There's people that need 40 50 60 plants and that's perfectly acceptable in a home
[45:26.700 --> 45:32.500]  Yeah, and and you can do that safely and there's no reason you can't I mean, especially with kids that like parents
[45:32.500 --> 45:39.980]  There's one lady that has 19 different strains for her child and it works and she can't she loses those strains
[45:39.980 --> 45:43.060]  It's like she's screwed and that's the kid
[45:43.060 --> 45:49.820]  Damn, that kid needs that and I mean it's it's pretty powerful to be able to provide something like that for a child in your
[45:49.820 --> 45:56.540]  Own home and then somebody tries to say no, it's like fuck you. You can't do that. Go to the store, right?
[45:56.540 --> 45:57.940]  Yeah
[45:57.940 --> 46:01.900]  Yeah, it doesn't work the same. It's missing shit. That's mass-produced. It's like
[46:04.300 --> 46:09.140]  Yeah for the price of I don't exactly know what a gram cost to produce at home
[46:09.140 --> 46:12.920]  I've done math and it's come out somewhere between 50 cents and two bucks a gram
[46:12.920 --> 46:17.980]  I think to produce cannabis at home just depend what kind of nutrients and what your electrical happens to be where you are
[46:18.260 --> 46:23.340]  I've heard as low as 30 cents a gram. What dispensary? Can you find anything for 30 cents?
[46:24.340 --> 46:31.220]  I'm probably cheaper than at my house 10 or 12 dollars a gram at a dispensary minimum plus taxes plus getting there
[46:31.220 --> 46:34.060]  Right plus look at recreational tax, too
[46:34.060 --> 46:37.700]  And who knows what was sprayed on it who knows what kind of nutrients it was grown with
[46:37.700 --> 46:41.620]  I mean just everything tested for was a pyrethrium. I believe
[46:42.820 --> 46:43.860]  so
[46:43.860 --> 46:48.540]  All of the recreational products are currently tested July 1st was supposed to be the date
[46:48.540 --> 46:49.860]  I was gonna do another show about this
[46:49.860 --> 46:54.300]  We'll just talk about it now July 1st was supposed to be the date when all of the medical products were tested
[46:54.300 --> 46:56.260]  But they've pushed it back to later in the year
[46:56.260 --> 47:01.260]  It's gonna be closer to September or October before they're able to test everything. I get all their spread wheat through
[47:02.020 --> 47:07.040]  We don't have enough facilities. They haven't regulated testing facilities to do all of that
[47:07.040 --> 47:12.340]  So they implement that there's just gonna be pounds sitting there and all the shelves are gonna go bear because nobody can test the products
[47:12.340 --> 47:14.820]  See the it's like why aren't we focusing on that?
[47:14.820 --> 47:17.540]  why are we going after less than 1% and
[47:18.060 --> 47:22.060]  punishing everybody else and we could be going about the regulation and just setting the standard and
[47:22.580 --> 47:25.100]  Making a good presentation for the rest of the you know
[47:25.660 --> 47:27.660]  if we had
[47:27.980 --> 47:35.100]  Eight or twelve good solid standardized testing facilities that we're bringing in an excise tax every time that product got tested
[47:35.140 --> 47:39.860]  Do you think they would replace the revenues that they're making off of busting petty weed crimes?
[47:40.860 --> 47:42.860]  I
[47:45.380 --> 47:50.820]  Mean we just need some sort of operation people will see it. They will start to accept it. It just takes time
[47:51.260 --> 47:56.660]  You know, there's like my wife three and a half four years ago. She was like no no way in my house
[47:56.660 --> 48:04.420]  I think I'm like wow. Yeah, and now it's she's like well this you know, it works. She believes in she hates the smell
[48:04.420 --> 48:06.420]  She doesn't
[48:07.100 --> 48:13.140]  Respect that she's you know, she she's actually allergic to it. She tries really hard to like it and she does a good job
[48:13.140 --> 48:15.220]  She does she's a good supporter. She's
[48:16.660 --> 48:20.580]  Well, it's just saved me yeah, I mean you probably should probably
[48:23.500 --> 48:25.180]  Right
[48:25.180 --> 48:27.700]  Saved our money. I mean I've been able to
[48:28.700 --> 48:34.900]  Go shopping again and get food on the table again. Once I started growing for myself, it was like wow
[48:34.900 --> 48:36.620]  I wasn't spending
[48:36.620 --> 48:38.620]  2,700 to $3,000 a month
[48:38.860 --> 48:39.980]  dispensary
[48:39.980 --> 48:44.700]  All right. It was bad. How many prescriptions were you able to eliminate using cannabis?
[48:45.700 --> 48:47.700]  I
[48:50.940 --> 48:52.940]  Don't laugh at that but
[48:53.180 --> 48:57.780]  24 different prescriptions you've been through like all of them with cannabis and
[48:58.580 --> 49:03.460]  If you were gonna if you're having a shitty week and you're not feeling your best you need extra medicine
[49:03.460 --> 49:05.460]  How much are you gonna smoke in a whole week?
[49:06.460 --> 49:08.460]  now
[49:09.420 --> 49:10.780]  Maybe an ounce
[49:10.780 --> 49:15.340]  Okay, so somewhere between 150 and 200 bucks worth of quality cannabis, but if you grew it yourself
[49:15.820 --> 49:21.460]  We're looking at 28 grams. It may be 28 bucks worth of maybe $10 $10 worth
[49:22.060 --> 49:28.380]  Okay, everything's pretty much sponsored for me. So the nutrients are paid for and you get the see I pay water and lights
[49:28.660 --> 49:35.820]  Okay, and your energy your I mean your effort. Yeah. Well, yeah, but I don't really yeah, no when I include okay, but that's it
[49:35.820 --> 49:38.300]  So I mean it's it's to me. It's like nothing
[49:41.780 --> 49:44.220]  Growing of it is therapeutic for you also
[49:49.140 --> 49:51.140]  Go into his room with him and it's just
[49:51.980 --> 49:54.460]  Details here and there shows you every single plant
[49:54.460 --> 49:56.460]  Yeah, definitely part of the healing process
[49:56.940 --> 50:01.140]  And that's another reason why we want to bring these guys in because it will work for other people
[50:01.140 --> 50:03.300]  I know I feel calm in my garden me too
[50:03.300 --> 50:05.300]  I could be happy I have to drive
[50:05.340 --> 50:11.880]  55 miles from my house to the office every day and the last 10 miles of that drive is like bumper-to-bumper madness
[50:12.740 --> 50:17.020]  I could probably park my car run up to the guy in front me and punch him in the face six times and get
[50:17.020 --> 50:19.020]  back in my car before traffic
[50:21.060 --> 50:23.060]  Get in the grow it's just like
[50:26.500 --> 50:31.460]  Bunch of fans and it's 74 degrees and I'm happy. I like that temperature. Yeah
[50:31.460 --> 50:33.460]  Definitely
[50:33.980 --> 50:35.980]  Yeah, glorious
[50:35.980 --> 50:39.940]  I love to get it down to like 72 and last two and a half weeks
[50:40.020 --> 50:40.660]  Okay
[50:40.660 --> 50:45.860]  If I wasn't running a big perpetual I would do things a little bit differently with the perpetual you have to keep it
[50:46.180 --> 50:51.660]  Ideal across the board because I've got there are plants three every three weeks. There are new plants going in
[50:51.660 --> 50:56.140]  So I've got stuff at week one week three and week six week nine six and three
[50:56.140 --> 50:59.060]  So I have to have 12 12 and 74 degrees
[51:00.060 --> 51:02.940]  Yeah, well I've been playing with
[51:03.540 --> 51:09.660]  With light manipulation lately and I like I did it 35 days. I flipped into 1113
[51:09.660 --> 51:14.540]  I did the last one at 15 days and then I did one at just straight 1113
[51:14.540 --> 51:21.140]  I'm gonna see how if anything any flavor changes or anything's enhanced or anything
[51:21.140 --> 51:25.060]  What I noticed from the 1113 was when I was doing Fino hunts
[51:25.060 --> 51:29.860]  I would see much more phenotypical expression with the extended dark period
[51:29.860 --> 51:34.740]  I would see much more variation from different phenotypes. So for a breeder that was really handy
[51:34.740 --> 51:39.300]  What I did notice was it kind of diminished on my harvest weight. Yeah, it wasn't where it should be
[51:39.300 --> 51:43.940]  Yeah, seem to finish a little quicker to finish quicker. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah
[51:44.500 --> 51:51.020]  I've actually gotten a bump in weight from switching over to 1113 been that mammoth microbes. Well, it's been both
[51:51.020 --> 51:53.140]  Yeah, you said you wanted to give a shot? Oh, yeah
[51:54.140 --> 52:00.820]  Microbes has been huge for me. I love that that product it has made some of the densest stickiest nugs I've ever had
[52:01.260 --> 52:06.180]  Is it MED approved? Can we use it in the MED grows? I don't see why you couldn't
[52:06.180 --> 52:11.100]  Okay, a lot of products are banned a lot of shit is banned, right? It's a microbial inoculant
[52:11.100 --> 52:15.900]  I'm not sure it should be legit then I'll compare it to the other things that I use
[52:15.900 --> 52:18.380]  I can't talk about one of the products that I use
[52:19.380 --> 52:24.460]  Secrets yeah, it's just a proprietary thing, but we also use the veg bloom plus life
[52:24.820 --> 52:27.700]  So I'll compare it to that and see if it's got the same stuff in there
[52:27.700 --> 52:30.820]  You don't pee on your plants do you know what you hear me say that? No
[52:31.460 --> 52:35.620]  That's a secret. I've actually told people to pee in their plants. How do you make a plant like that?
[52:35.620 --> 52:38.460]  Just pee on them every morning drink six Guinnesses
[52:40.460 --> 52:43.620]  Makes it expand the microbes travel through
[52:48.380 --> 52:50.380]  Do that, please
[52:54.700 --> 52:59.460]  Maybe for a short while I don't want to smoke it. No Guinness in like eight years gosh
[53:00.220 --> 53:02.220]  Even want to think about that. Nope
[53:02.940 --> 53:06.380]  All right mammoth microbes big shout out to him Steve's got to go refill his water
[53:06.860 --> 53:10.020]  And we've been going for almost an hour you guys you're talking to folks
[53:10.020 --> 53:16.340]  I like we're already going for a while before to just talking here without we had to spend 30 minutes get my SD card fixed
[53:16.340 --> 53:19.620]  Because for some reason it didn't want to work when I showed up to record which was almost embarrassing
[53:19.700 --> 53:22.740]  But we pulled it off electronics man. That just happens
[53:25.340 --> 53:29.020]  Some reason it didn't work all right I feel like since Steve left
[53:29.020 --> 53:32.620]  We're all stuck at a low cuz he's got a notebook over there, and he was kind of running the show
[53:33.020 --> 53:36.780]  Steve's definitely the talker yeah, he's a people person we're
[53:36.780 --> 53:38.780]  I'm
[53:42.180 --> 53:44.180]  Gonna grow soil hydro
[53:44.540 --> 53:45.980]  Cocoa
[53:45.980 --> 53:52.540]  the nectar number eight soils the one we like we add a little extra perlite and it's a cocoa based and
[53:53.900 --> 53:57.540]  Their whole line is just or all the organic things
[53:57.540 --> 54:03.740]  I would use in my soil, but in bottles and pH low so that it doesn't go bad and
[54:04.060 --> 54:09.540]  And that stuff works great half the time me and Steve can't even tell the difference between our weeds
[54:09.540 --> 54:12.300]  We they have like different overtones and stuff
[54:12.300 --> 54:19.340]  But I'm very impressed with the nectar further with God's line and more organic sky. I don't like any lines really I
[54:20.340 --> 54:26.020]  Understand that I have a friend named Sean who's been on the podcast a lot of times who doesn't use any bottles nothing
[54:26.020 --> 54:31.300]  He's using comes from a bottle. That's where I am his product is definitely you can tell that it's a different product
[54:31.300 --> 54:35.440]  It's cleaner it burns better though ashes are as white as his parchment paper fishbone meal
[54:35.540 --> 54:40.020]  Yeah, bone meals all about fish, and he's got the fishbone meal bottle
[54:40.020 --> 54:45.100]  And it's just fishbone meal diluted into water, and I fucking love it. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah
[54:45.620 --> 54:49.780]  Steve got me inspired he went got a beverage. I'm reaching for one out of the backpack here. I know it's in here
[54:50.260 --> 54:51.700]  What are you looking for?
[54:51.700 --> 54:53.700]  This dr. Pepper that's in here. Oh nice
[54:55.420 --> 54:59.780]  You came prepared you gotta come prepared to the podcast we have no idea where you're going
[55:01.300 --> 55:03.300]  I
[55:05.420 --> 55:09.420]  Don't on the podcast right got anything to say dog
[55:11.580 --> 55:13.580]  Speak
[55:14.820 --> 55:20.560]  Does the dog like cannabis oh yeah, it's been trim cycle, and we just give the dogs the leaves the family
[55:20.560 --> 55:26.580]  So you know they're not getting high off of it or anything, but those vitamins and stuff. I know it's good phytonutrients
[55:26.580 --> 55:31.940]  And it's so funny they eat the leaves off and leave the stem and they'll nibble around the stem
[55:31.940 --> 55:36.580]  And they're just like oh, we don't want that, but yeah, they'll clean our floors afterwards
[55:37.180 --> 55:40.420]  Hilarious pretty cool dogs. I got the brother of this dog to oh neat
[55:40.420 --> 55:40.820]  Yeah
[55:40.820 --> 55:48.580]  so the black one is the mom and then this this gold one over here came out of her and Steve got one of the
[55:48.580 --> 55:50.580]  all black ones and
[55:51.340 --> 55:55.100]  Breeding dogs was an experience. I like breeding plants way more
[55:55.660 --> 56:00.980]  Okay well my mind went somewhere really weird with that because it's much easier to get rid of ugly plants
[56:08.700 --> 56:10.700]  At least it's frowned upon right a lot
[56:20.300 --> 56:23.860]  Is like nothing I don't know anything about dogs that went missing
[56:25.100 --> 56:27.100]  a bag full of puppies
[56:29.500 --> 56:31.500]  The show just got really weird
[56:32.260 --> 56:38.140]  Farming cannabis some more because yeah this podcast I was looking at the dates this podcast ironically I did not plan this
[56:38.660 --> 56:40.660]  This is gonna come out on the 4th of July
[56:41.380 --> 56:48.180]  Perfectly timed good job awesome. That's great holiday podcast. Yeah, if you guys are listening. I hope you're uh don't drive drunk
[56:48.180 --> 56:53.460]  Yeah, that's my advice if you're on the boat don't boat drunk. Yeah, don't do that be careful
[56:53.460 --> 56:56.340]  If you're at a state park celebrating today be careful with your cannabis
[56:56.340 --> 57:01.420]  And if you're listening after the 4th of July because most people are gonna wait till Tuesday to listen to this since Monday's a holiday
[57:01.420 --> 57:03.420]  I hope you made it
[57:05.300 --> 57:09.460]  Hope everything went your way. Hope you're safe if things didn't I'm fucking sorry. It's terrible
[57:09.460 --> 57:12.740]  Yeah, do not light any mortar shells off your chest or head whoa
[57:12.740 --> 57:14.740]  Oh
[57:20.740 --> 57:22.740]  One
[57:31.940 --> 57:34.700]  Man chasing those likes on YouTube yeah
[57:35.420 --> 57:42.180]  For a few likes I hope that worked man. Don't burn down any state parks or any of our beautiful fires
[57:42.740 --> 57:46.780]  Please don't do that stupidity you guys burn some joints down burn a lot of joints
[57:46.780 --> 57:49.540]  Yes, but be careful wherever you are wherever you're doing it burn some joints
[57:50.220 --> 57:55.780]  Cannabis may be legal in Colorado, but there's no legal place to consume it other than your house. That's correct
[57:57.820 --> 58:01.600]  Yeah, it's it's kind of it's stupid isn't it like there you go
[58:01.600 --> 58:03.420]  You can smoke it somewhere here in the Springs
[58:03.420 --> 58:07.180]  We could have great open parks where people love to go and smoke down
[58:07.180 --> 58:11.940]  But you know if there's for some reason there's a cop up there. They'll get in trouble, and I don't understand it
[58:11.940 --> 58:13.780]  They're not bothering anyone
[58:13.780 --> 58:15.780]  You have a plan go to jail I?
[58:16.980 --> 58:23.340]  I'm a father and I don't want to be walking through the park with my daughter enjoying ice cream
[58:23.340 --> 58:27.620]  And have to explain to her what you guys are doing when you're up there taking dabs
[58:27.620 --> 58:32.780]  That's not that's not your guys's conversation to introduce to my daughter's life
[58:32.780 --> 58:36.660]  That's mine to bring up when the time is right kind of thanks for being there
[58:36.660 --> 58:38.660]  So now we can have that talk is my opinion
[58:38.860 --> 58:42.940]  Not everyone's yeah, not not everyone wants their three-year
[58:42.940 --> 58:46.220]  I've got a 13 year old so it's plenty time past time to have a weed talk
[58:46.220 --> 58:50.780]  We've talked about weed a lot of times. She doesn't care. She's oh my god dad that we'd think so bad
[58:51.780 --> 58:55.460]  With my seven year old yeah, I mean once she was about four
[58:56.060 --> 58:59.180]  It was like okay look I want to educate you on this
[58:59.180 --> 59:03.980]  She knows not to touch it not to get close to it. She stays completely away from it
[59:04.260 --> 59:10.860]  You know she just knows she's been educated she has no desire for it. She knows it's medicine. It's not whoa. It's fun
[59:10.860 --> 59:11.700]  It's not like that
[59:11.700 --> 59:18.020]  It's like it's medicine, but I don't I just I just don't want anybody to have to have the talk right of me
[59:18.020 --> 59:23.820]  What's that smell? Yeah? What's that hippie guy doing over there dad? He's doing drugs like it's just gonna go down
[59:23.820 --> 59:27.780]  I just don't want to do that to our scene. We should respect those parks a little better
[59:27.780 --> 59:30.460]  I'm a hypocrite cuz I took a dab at the park the other day
[59:34.860 --> 59:37.380]  From here and my friend was nice enough to bring me lunch
[59:37.380 --> 59:40.460]  And I thought she deserves some dabs for bringing me lunch, so I was like well
[59:40.460 --> 59:42.060]  Let's go to that park right there
[59:42.060 --> 59:46.340]  Yes, that's why we need our dab lounges around and the Springs said no to those two
[59:47.620 --> 59:52.380]  Yeah, I miss being able to go to one of my favorite places to ever go in Springs was to go hang out at
[59:52.380 --> 59:53.060]  the Canyon Canyon
[59:53.060 --> 59:55.060]  That's the first time Steven I met
[59:55.220 --> 59:59.380]  Recording a podcast at the Canyon and posted that I was there and he showed up and brought weed for me to try
[59:59.980 --> 01:00:05.880]  Arguably it's truly regulated like alcohol you should be able to consume in a public place like a bar
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.380]  That's the most valid argument out of all of it
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:14.700]  You try to eat the people the officials the legislation is the one that made it regulated that was their idea regulate it like alcohol
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:20.180]  There's an alcohol drinking establishment on every two blocks if you're in Pueblo. There's one every 30 feet
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:25.540]  It's terrible in Pueblo so many drinking places and nowhere legal to consume
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.660]  Except for in your house in your house
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:33.500]  And that's if you have permission from your landlord if you rent and how am I supposed to medicate safely on a lunch break?
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:37.660]  If I don't live here right oh, well you shouldn't be medicating anyways
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:42.020]  I can't rely on showing up at your house every day can I hey Steve can I sit on your couch for 20 minutes take?
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.020]  Four dabs and get out of here well
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.020]  Spencer how good friends we are

[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:52.680]  We want to know.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.680]  Is it live resin?
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:54.680]  Is it shatter?
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.680]  Is it poop soup?
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:56.680]  Is it tain batter?
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.680]  What do you got going on?
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.800]  Is it some of those EvoLabs fresh trips?
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.200]  Let's talk about some of these fresh trips.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.640]  Let's not keep talking about it.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.880]  Not a lot of people in the world know what the hell I'm even talking about.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.640]  It got fancier, people.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.880]  We have stepped up our game here in Colorado.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.240]  Our friends at EvoLabs, so we, they, I said we like I'm involved in this shit.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.240]  I smoke it.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.360]  That's my role in this party.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.240]  Involved consumer level only.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.920]  I do a little product research for these guys.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.960]  I'll be your space monkey.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.960]  I don't care.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.120]  They take some shatter.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.120]  They take hash.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.120]  I think they're taking CO2 oil.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:34.440]  I'm 90% sure that this is made with CO2 oil, a CO2 extraction.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:41.280]  There's a lot of people right now in the industry playing with refining CO2 oil in one way or
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.280]  another.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.880]  This seems to be my favorite way.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.120]  This is a fractal distillation process.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.920]  This is the first home run I've gotten to play with.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.680]  All of the clear, they're calling it distillate.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.640]  All of the distillate is done with a fractal distillation process.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.160]  They're separating basically everything.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.960]  The cannabinoids, the terpenoids, and the lipids are all pulled apart.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.920]  This container right here is a container of nothing but the THC.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:16.260]  This is 90%, 90.94% THC and 1.1% CBD.
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.760]  This is raw distillate from EvoLabs.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.520]  I'm going to open the jar here and try to describe what's in this container the best
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.700]  I can.
[01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:32.700]  It looks like really runny honey or super clear olive oil maybe, but it's got more of
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.340]  the consistency of honey or maple syrup.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:37.760]  It's a little thicker than any olive oil I've ever seen, but yeah.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.760]  The color might be right though.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:39.760]  Yeah.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:40.760]  Yeah.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.460]  It just looks like, I don't know, it's like honey almost in there, but this doesn't have
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:44.460]  much flavor.
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.460]  It is just raw distillate THC.
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.460]  This is super potent.
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:47.460]  Super stupid potent.
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:52.100]  I put a little bit of this on the dabber and this is where it gets fun.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:57.940]  I take that little bit that's on the dabber and I dunk that into the Ghost Train Haze
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.820]  Raw Terps.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:05.220]  This is mostly terpenoids with a little bit of cannabinoids, like 1% or 2% THC in here.
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:08.300]  Am I a dick if I call it the adult version of Fun Dips?
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:13.560]  This is definitely, well, I'm a deadhead and we've got our own little version of Fun Dips,
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.900]  but this is the weed world of a Fun Dip.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:19.580]  This is a beautiful thing.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:26.220]  So you take that beautiful 90% THC distillate and then you dunk it.
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.220]  You dunk it.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:31.660]  And the glorious part is in my other hand, I've got some OG Kush Terps.
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:35.620]  So I can either dunk it in my OG Kush Terps or I can dunk it over here in my Ghost Train
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:40.460]  Haze Terps, or I could dunk it in one and then I could dunk it in the other.
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:42.660]  And we're changing up the flavors.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:48.600]  The OG Kush Terps, if you put it on this distillate and dab it, it tastes like you, if apples
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.600]  tasted like OG Kush and you bit into an OG Kush apple, it was just OG Kush all in my
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.120]  mouth and you could almost chew the flavor.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.120]  That's how much OG Kush flavor these Terps put in your face.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.360]  It's the flavor contents really, really nice this way.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:07.280]  And then the high from the distillate comboed with, I really liked the high that I get from
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.360]  the Ghost Train Haze.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.160]  This is sativa dominant strain.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.600]  I talk about this every day.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.880]  The other stuff that's in it, the THC is definitely a big part of the high, but everything else
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:23.840]  that's in it really plays with that THC in some fun ways.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.720]  I almost never go for the most potent on the shelf.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:31.720]  And if you think about the rest of your life, you typically don't do that either.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.560]  You've got to get that other component to it.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.800]  In this way, you can get both.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.200]  You can get insanely potent and really, really flavorful.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.200]  I've been kind of being a snobby bitch.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.960]  I take some of this Blue Sherb 120 micron, fresh frozen solventless hash and I roll out
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.680]  a little patty and then I dunk some Durban poison shatter onto it.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.480]  And then I rubbed a little Cactus Cooler Live resin on top of that.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.880]  Then I put a little bit of the Terps on it.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.800]  And then I put some of that 90% THC distillate on top of there.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.920]  And I took a big ass dab of that.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.400]  Remember in high school when you used to go park somewhere and see how high you could
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.400]  get?
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:12.040]  I don't think we got that high is when I took that big ass dab.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.280]  My arm hair was wiggling around.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.280]  It was visibly waving like a flag.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:21.040]  I've been doing something similar with just much, much cheaper product.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.120]  With just your typical wax or shatter, I'll take a piece of shatter and kind of pancake
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:30.040]  it out real far, throw a little wax in the middle, roll up a little taquito and dab that.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.560]  But mine are much smaller and much less fancy than the ones you've been throwing down.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.160]  I like to go big or go home when I take dabs.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.760]  I'll go little and go often.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:38.760]  It's so much easier.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.480]  I go big and go often.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.840]  Best of both worlds, I suppose.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.360]  One of the best parts about taking dabs is that you can grab the dabber and Mike can
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.360]  take his dosage.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.040]  Mike's a cigarette smoker.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.120]  When you get Mike worked up a little bit, you can hear him gurgle.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.160]  He doesn't even need dabs to start making funky lung motor noises.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.160]  Nope.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.160]  That just happens.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.160]  He sounds like the bong occasionally.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.960]  I give Mike...
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.040]  If you handed me the dabs that I gave Mike, I would laugh at you.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:07.240]  I'd say, can you maybe triple, quadruple that up?
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:11.120]  And Mike takes just little pin sides dabs, probably the dabs you take.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.920]  Mike takes that size of a dab and he will cough and turn purple and get sweaty.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:21.440]  With the e-nail carb cap set up as smooth as it is over here, I cough like a beast.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.640]  It's not nearly as bad as home because I don't have that carb cap.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.560]  The cap adds quite a bit, people.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.160]  Get yourself a carb cap.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.400]  This is a 710 episode.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.240]  Let's educate folks on the e-nail right quick.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:36.960]  The electronic continuously heated nail is a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.640]  It's also a little dangerous depending on where you dab.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.120]  I had one in the car for several days.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.480]  Well, the space I dab often is also shared by three large dogs that are really furry
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.720]  and fluffy and psychotic.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:55.840]  And so if I was going to add an e-nail to that mix, something would get set on fire
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.840]  that I care about.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.840]  Yeah, a dog would get burned.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.120]  You'd have a bald spot somewhere.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.740]  And so there's kind of a reason I don't have one yet, but it's on the short list of things
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:04.840]  to treat myself to.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.440]  I had to take mine out of the car.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.920]  I was getting careless.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:14.280]  I was getting too high in the car, which I was like, I'm pretty, pretty medicated here.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.000]  I got to chill out on this.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.720]  And then also I had to set the rig in the cup holder and I forgot it was there and I
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.200]  felt warmth a couple of times.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:25.280]  I don't know that I was going to burn myself, but I was like, oh, that is warm over there.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.280]  And I had to think about it.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.900]  I was like, yeah, I'm kind of close to that.
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:29.320]  So I took the e-nail out of the car.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.120]  That doesn't happen anymore.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.120]  Be careful, you guys.
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:35.960]  I can't tell you what to do, but if there's somebody in the backseat that needs to have
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:40.160]  their medical cannabis available while you're driving, they can consume their medical cannabis.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.160]  Do your thing.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.160]  You're an adult.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.920]  But so the e-nail, there's a box on my table.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.360]  It's a six inches long, four inches tall.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.560]  It's smaller than the original Nintendo, but a little taller.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.560]  Yeah.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.560]  Okay.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.560]  Yeah.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.560]  Yeah.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.560]  And it's got a display on it.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.560]  A little led display with the number.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.560]  It's got a power switch on it.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.560]  One of the coolest fucking features.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.560]  It's got a USB port.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560]  Mike is charging his phone.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:05.560]  Pretty much every episode that I've been on in the last six months, my phone's been charging
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.560]  on that USB slot.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.960]  That's a really beautiful feature.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.600]  Shout out to my friend Giddy up at Emotech.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.120]  This e-nail was actually a gift from Giddy up at Emotech.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.440]  So big shout out and shout out to Margalise for the replacement coils.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.320]  I appreciate that, bro.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:22.280]  But so there's this box with an led screen on the front with numbers displayed on it.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.040]  And coming out of that box is another cord.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.040]  It's a silver cord.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.560]  It's a silver braided cord.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.560]  And it goes to where the dab nail is.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.560]  It goes up to your nail.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.560]  Yeah.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:45.080]  So we've got a much larger titanium domeless that has this coil leading to it.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:49.080]  And then it's tightly wrapped around the nail so that it can evenly heat that surface.
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.080]  Yeah.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.000]  To whatever temperature we feel like.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  That's where I want to jump in.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.560]  And everybody talks about what temperature is your e-nail set to.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.480]  I do not believe that that number right there where it says 717 right now.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.640]  That's not at all a temperature.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:04.800]  I don't think that's a temperature.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:10.240]  I don't think it correlates to the actual temperature on my nail surface because I think
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:15.160]  this box would cost much more money for it to actually have a thermostat inside it that's
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.160]  doing that.
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.600]  One of our friends that is a guy that works on my website actually told me that's actually
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.600]  a frequency.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.800]  That's what I've always understood it to be is just the random frequency that it kicks
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:26.800]  out.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.040]  It's like your speakers.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.040]  11 doesn't fucking mean anything.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.040]  Perfect.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.040]  Yeah.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.040]  Well, I know that in my car.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.040]  But it means something to you in relation to how loud it's going to be.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:34.040]  I know that in my car 23 is like the prime spot.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:40.240]  If I go up to 26, it gets a little and you don't want to hear that shit.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.640]  Jerry starts sounding a little extra heroin-y if you turn them up too loud.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:47.200]  I've posted pictures before us getting ready to record stuff and somebody always chimes
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.080]  in and is like, dude, your e-nail's like 300 degrees too hot.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.960]  And it's like, that's not a temperature.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.440]  It's always like the first three replies that I have to put up.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.440]  Yeah.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.080]  I'm sure if you bought seven Emotech units, they'd all be close to the same.
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:02.080]  I've seen a couple that have the temperature display and I like that.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.080]  Yeah.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.840]  The one TaskRock made, the original, and we're going to talk about TaskRock, you guys.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.240]  This is the fucking 710 episode you best believe we're going to talk about our boy TaskRock.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.520]  The original e-nail, that TaskRock of highly educated, the innovator, the originator, that
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:20.920]  original e-nail did, I think, that temperature did correlate to the one on the box, although
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.040]  I'm not certain, but I'm pretty sure it did.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.320]  Shout out to Big D with the original.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.960]  He's got the museum version.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.480]  He's got the first e-mail that Task made.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.480]  It's on Daniel's shelf.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.480]  Much love and respect to Big D. Miss you, bro.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.480]  Hope to see you soon.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.480]  Let's get you on the podcast.
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.240]  The good old days.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.320]  So I really don't think that that number correlates.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.840]  I think like Mike said-
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.440]  That's definitely not a temperature.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.600]  When you get in your car, whatever, where you like it, where you really like to jam
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.920]  out, when your favorite song comes on, when Born to be Wild comes on, and you want to
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:53.360]  drive on the freeway way too fast, whatever, like 23, 39, whatever it is on your car stereo.
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.400]  Yeah, that's not 23 decibels.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.880]  It's just a random number they picked.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.600]  It had something for you to think about.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.600]  Medium high right before it starts crackling.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:04.840]  I like to think my dab's kind of hot.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.000]  I like the e-mail a little hotter than most people.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.440]  When Spence would come over, shout out to Spencer from the Garden of Weed.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:10.440]  I'd immediately turn it down.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:11.440]  I was going to do that.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.440]  He wouldn't even ask.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.440]  He'd be like, you don't nail too hot, dog.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:14.480]  And just, he didn't say dog.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.080]  He would call me the N word.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.080]  You're nailed too hot, N word.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.800]  And reach over and just turn my shit down like it was his.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:22.520]  And I wouldn't argue because that's Spencer and he made the hash for about to dab.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.640]  So I'm just going to let him do his thing.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.800]  But he would always turn it the fuck down.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800]  He'd be like, my esophagus.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.160]  You know, he says, burn that esophagus.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.720]  So he turned that fucker down.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.400]  I take pretty low temp dabs at home.
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.400]  Every now and then I undershoot it or like I sneeze between heating the nail with the
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:41.720]  torch and going to dab and then find it's a little too cold and I puddle.
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:44.240]  I like a big chunky dab.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.920]  So I feel like you have to overheat.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.920]  You have to have it.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:47.920]  It's not even overheating.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.640]  It's just hot enough to cook all that.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.120]  Otherwise I'm sucking like four dabs.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:56.760]  Back in the day, bro, we used to go way until that skillet glows like the sun.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.760]  You keep heating.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.760]  I saw it.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.720]  I saw the grateful, the remaining members of the grateful dead.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.840]  Phil Lesh doesn't tour anymore, so they call themselves dead and co.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.200]  I saw dead and co at in Boulder.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.440]  A shout out to my friend that took me to that show.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:14.520]  But I saw the dead in Boulder and fucking there were some kids taking dabs in the back
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.520]  of this SUV.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:18.360]  They had the tailgate up and they had the dab rig sitting up on a little thing so that
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.480]  all they had to do was put it to their face.
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.960]  And the dude heats it with the torch and I'm just walking toward this car, walking through
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.320]  rows, walking through the parking lot.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.920]  And I see him just, and I was like, it's hot.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:33.640]  You can fucking stop trying to turn that nail into fucking water right now.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:34.640]  And I didn't say anything.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.640]  It was none of my business.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.120]  I was like, oh, he's going to put the dome on or whatever and let it cool.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.120]  Nah, bro.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:43.480]  I did through the dome on and fucking put that dabber to that nail while it was glowing
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.720]  bright orange.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.720]  And I just cringed.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.720]  I was like, oh my God.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:49.760]  Like it was not my place to say anything, but my heart just tingled.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.600]  I was like, oh God, that for poor fucking stab.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:57.920]  It's a, not only are you ruining yourself for no reason, you're also losing so much
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:58.920]  of the flavor.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.560]  You're burning up the turps, man.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.600]  You're burning the turps.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.840]  The downside is if you undershoot it, you end up just wasting your hash on the nail.
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.320]  It puddles instead of vaporizes.
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.320]  And that's sad.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.320]  Yeah, in our world.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.520]  So that's, let me, let me talk about that.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:17.080]  When I talk, when I hit the e-mail, when I'm taking a big fat dab, a lot of times you guys,
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.240]  I come home from work and I want to dab like a half grand, maybe a gram of hash in one
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.240]  fucking dab.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.240]  I'm not kidding.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.240]  Uh, there are more people in this room.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.840]  They'll wait, raise their hands and fucking testify.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.840]  Rasta Jeff will pull a grandma, dad, granddad.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:27.840]  No problem.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:28.840]  We got hands up testify.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:31.880]  So, uh, but again, I like to take a big fat dab.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.400]  I will do that on the email.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.880]  A lot of times when I'm smoking these turps and the distillate, I bust out this one right
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.760]  here, my elevate the line cycler with the little banger on it.
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:41.760]  Yeah.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.760]  It's got a, they say it's courts.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:43.760]  I bet you money.
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:44.760]  That's fucking glass.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.880]  Uh, I got a little glass of banger on there.
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:46.880]  That's my flavor saver.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:48.680]  I think it tastes a little bit better.
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.960]  I think, uh, courts versus tie.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:56.480]  I think sometimes I've got to say that the courts taste a little bit better in my opinion.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:01.880]  I, uh, I have that on my short list of things I want to treat myself with as an ice courts
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.880]  banger.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.880]  I really dig.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.920]  I'm do this one here.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:11.040]  This is a highly educated titanium base with the courts dish on top.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.500]  I saw some of that on Instagram and didn't let myself look cause I was doing car repairs
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.500]  at the time.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:20.260]  I like myself that likes to travel with a little rig like that.
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.260]  That's the way to go.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:24.460]  Cause this banger, the way that I travel with it, that would get destroyed quickly.
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:30.260]  Well, uh, where, where my dad rig sits most of the time that would be safe.
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:33.540]  Like I can't risk the email right now, but I could risk the bucket.
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.740]  The puppy could take the bucket, but not the email.
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.020]  Well, it's safer.
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.020]  It's the cord.
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:40.100]  That's the problem on the email.
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:41.820]  Like just in practice.
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:46.260]  I know my, my household well enough to me to know that that rig would get yanked off
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.740]  that court is dangerous at this table, right?
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:52.940]  That court is knocked over and broken this exact rig once before just sitting there,
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.740]  it just wobbled and spun itself over.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:58.740]  Cause the, you guys, the court on this email is it's was coiled in a box for a hundred
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:22:59.740]  years.
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:02.180]  It looks like and shipped from fucking China and vacuum packed.
[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:05.080]  And so it's going to be coily shaped for the rest of his life.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.380]  And sometimes you try to straighten it out and it makes you think it went straight, but
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:12.740]  then it just starts coiling slowly itself up and tip your rig over.
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:15.900]  So turn your email off when you leave the house.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:19.260]  That's a reminder to myself also, you know, have no idea how many times I've come home
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:23.340]  and been like, Oh shit, never leave the house with an active heat source running like that.
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:26.380]  It's just kind of basic human.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:30.620]  So low tip is better when I'm doing a small dab is what I wanted to kind of take that
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:33.180]  email versus the courts, the titanium versus courts.
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:36.820]  If I do a nice thing about the courts is you can bring that temp down even further.
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:37.820]  Just let it cool.
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:39.620]  Get it, get it glowy hot and let it go.
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:40.860]  Don't guys don't be that.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:42.100]  Don't ever do be that guy.
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:43.100]  Shout out to Jason Margulies.
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:46.740]  I got so many friends that'll heat the nail until it's glowing orange and bust on a fucking
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:49.860]  timer and they have timed exactly like from what it glows right here, bro.
[01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:52.380]  You hit go and wait this many seconds.
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:53.860]  Perfect fucking dab, bro.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:56.820]  Like, yeah, I'm always like, no, you waited too long.
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:58.940]  I should have gotten seven seconds sooner than that.
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:23:59.940]  Cause it's too cool for me.
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:03.740]  I like a little warm, but if I'm trying to dab these turps, I'll oftentimes go for the
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:06.460]  courts and go low temp, low temp.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.340]  We say you got to taste it to waste it.
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:12.940]  Hit it low temp, carb cap it, just get all that flavor in there.
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:16.740]  Take a little tiny dab and then grab a Q-tip, heat the nail just a little bit and clean
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:17.740]  it out with the Q-tip.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.700]  And now you got a fresh banger again.
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.340]  They call that the Q-tip tech.
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:22.340]  I don't play that way.
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:23.860]  I heat the fuck out of it until it's clean.
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:26.420]  And then I throw another dab in it.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:27.780]  That's how I roll with the banger.
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:30.660]  I'm not on the Q-tip tech and the low temp tech, all that.
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:33.700]  I like to take a fat dab and get it on.
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.180]  My buddy Adam Mill would say, red means go.
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:39.300]  He eats the fuck out of it and just throws a mad dab in there.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:41.300]  No, I can't.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:42.820]  It's too much on my throat.
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:43.820]  Yeah.
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:44.820]  Low temp is better for you.
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:45.820]  Low temp is better.
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:46.820]  Fine.
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:49.820]  So guys, when you're trying to set the temperature to your email, everyone's like, what temperature
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:50.820]  do I set it?
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:51.820]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:52.820]  You got something to jump in with.
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:53.820]  Go for it.
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:58.740]  I was going to say that's the right setup is really key to getting the most out of your
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:24:59.740]  hash.
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:05.460]  You can take a really nice low temp dab on an email and with the carb cap, you don't
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:06.940]  waste anything.
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:12.880]  Even if you go really low, it's still going to continuously heat that surface and vaporize
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.340]  everything off.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.840]  You've got it carb capped.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:20.140]  Even if it takes a second to get it done, you're not going to lose anything.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:23.580]  You can actually enjoy all of that.
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:28.700]  And it's one of those things where it takes the time and investing in the right tools
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:30.780]  to really get the best bang out of your product.
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:34.300]  And that's part of the reason I end up so baked here is because I've only got like half
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.900]  the pieces at home.
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:40.300]  And so when I low temp it, I end up losing a good bit off the top of my nail.
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:41.740]  So I'm taking small dabs anyway.
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:43.020]  You got to clean it up.
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:46.980]  I noticed that the first dab, every time I come over here, I cough way harder than I
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:50.620]  have in a week or two.
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:53.260]  And then I get a little bit higher than I've been in a week or two.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:57.460]  Part of that I think is because I use a smaller rig than most folks.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.460]  Yeah.
[01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:04.460]  I really like, I prefer a smaller rig and I prefer an E nail on a small rig right now.
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:08.660]  I'm hitting the Hitman sidecar, the E-series sidecar.
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:09.660]  This whole rig.
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:12.660]  It's small to the point and it heats to the point where he's got to keep an eye on the
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:15.060]  water level because it will cook itself dry.
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.980]  That has happened before.
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:21.020]  My mad Rob is like fucking four inches tall.
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:22.020]  I love these little rigs.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:23.020]  I like this.
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:25.140]  That'll cook itself raw during a podcast.
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:27.820]  We've seen that happen before and you caught it before you did it.
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:30.460]  That's a sloppy taking a dry dab.
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:36.860]  This Elevate Klein, it's taller, but it's still got a very minimal amount of airspace.
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:41.180]  I don't want a lot of space from the time that I put my dab on the surface of this dab
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:45.420]  nail for it to go down here, down this tube, into the water and into my face.
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:47.980]  I want as little resistance as possible.
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:50.780]  I just want to get that dab into my brain.
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:51.980]  Just give it to me.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:56.060]  And I feel like all the percolators and all the extra bubbles and shit, that's just stealing
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:58.460]  your dabs, stealing your turps, stealing your flavor.
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.220]  I don't want all that extra bubbleage.
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:04.300]  I want enough water just to cool it down from hitting that nail and then let me get it.
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:10.380]  I actually took dabs today through this little rig without enough water in it and I got ultra
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:11.380]  high.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:15.420]  That's stupid high because it didn't have enough water and it was kind of burny.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:19.700]  It made my throat tingle a little bit, but holy shit, I was red eyed.
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:25.860]  The first time I used a really good portable hash pen, they never last for very long, but
[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:31.940]  the first time I used one that gave you that first dozen hits well, burned the fuck out
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:32.940]  of my throat.
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:33.940]  Yeah.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:34.940]  Yeah.
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:35.940]  Those little cloud pens?
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:36.940]  No percolation.
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:37.940]  Tastes like hot plastic?
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:39.220]  No, it was a different company.
[01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:44.740]  Still tasted like hot plastic because the mouthpiece was plastic, but fuck, dude, that
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.420]  burn lasted all week.
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:48.700]  Got the throat burned for a week.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:52.340]  Remember when you used to hit a bong, you'd fill it, you'd get it full and you'd keep
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.700]  sucking and that chamber would fill and you'd keep sucking and all your friends would be
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:56.740]  like, pull it, pull it.
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:58.340]  And you'd look at them like, nope, I'm going to get high as fuck.
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:01.540]  I'm going to take a big ass bong hit and then you pull it and then all that smoke goes in
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:02.780]  your head.
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:05.580]  That's the point of a big pipe or a big bong or a big rig.
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.940]  Fill that fucker up and then carve it and get smoke.
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:10.940]  If you notice a dab rig, there's no carb.
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.180]  You just want that fucking smoke.
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:13.180]  You know what I mean?
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:16.500]  Throw the carb cap on to trap the heat in the nail and put a little vacuum in there.
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.980]  You got a little tiny hole in the carb cap.
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:19.580]  You get less air flowing through.
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:20.620]  That heat stays in there.
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:23.300]  Every bit of air that comes through moves that oil around on the top of the nail and
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:25.700]  it goes into your brain and then you get stupid high.
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:30.140]  I don't feel the need to suck like a liter of oxygen through my bong before I start getting
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:31.140]  my dab to my face.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:33.860]  I'm not a fan of dab bongs and I know a lot of people that are.
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:40.380]  I sell an amazing nail that is, it's a beautiful six in one that's designed for rigs or bongs.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:41.940]  It'll fit anything on the market.
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:44.220]  It's a copy of the highly educated Infiniti nail.
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.220]  I'm sure it is.
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.660]  It's a beautiful, beautiful invention.
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:48.660]  Completely is.
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:49.660]  That's what you're talking about.
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:53.500]  Every time I see it and I've got extra money in my pocket, I'm like, that's fucking selling
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.500]  my shit on.
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:58.580]  But then I remember that I don't like dab bongs.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:02.260]  It's just way too much volume.
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.100]  You can see it on the inside of the glass.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:06.660]  You're like, that's hash that's supposed to be in my brain.
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:07.660]  It's not.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:08.660]  It's on the side of the glass.
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:09.660]  Yeah.
[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:11.600]  And as much as you cough and choke anyway, you don't need to spend that extra energy
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.620]  on your lungs pulling a liter of air up through your fucking tube.
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:15.620]  It's funny.
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:17.340]  I love a bong for flour.
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:18.860]  That's my primary smoking device.
[01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:20.060]  Cleaned my bong yesterday.
[01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:21.060]  Love it.
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:28.020]  Picked up flour today and yesterday because that's mainly what I've been smoking at home.
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:31.420]  But for a nice dab, you got to go with a smaller rig.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.420]  Yeah.
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:35.740]  I prefer when you started talking about flour, maybe you want to segue into something else
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:36.740]  that I wrote down.
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:38.660]  I prefer indica flowers.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:41.420]  If I was going to go shopping, like right here on the table, I've got some blue sherb
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:43.980]  that I grew at the Greener Healthy Wellness Garden.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:45.460]  I smell so yummy.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.780]  And then here in this container, I got some Jeff's OG that I grew.
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:50.340]  These are both heavy indica dominant strains.
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:52.580]  This one just has that funk to it.
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:54.580]  And gorgeous, by the way.
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:55.580]  Well done, sir.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:56.580]  Thank you.
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:00.020]  This so far is my proudest grow in this garden, but wait until you see the next couple of
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.020]  runs.
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:02.020]  I'm already impressed.
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:06.660]  But I prefer these indica dominant flowers, the sit you down, chill you out, cushy, piney,
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:07.660]  dank flavored flowers.
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:10.660]  I'm going to roll a joint with that and I'm going to smoke it.
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:14.460]  And it's just going to taste earthy and funky and coffee-like.
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:18.420]  But then when it comes to my dabs, if you notice all my dab selection, everything over
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:19.980]  here is like candy flavors and shit.
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:21.740]  I like the cactus cooler.
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:25.380]  And over here, this one doesn't even have a label anymore, whatever that was.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:27.540]  We got some of the blue sherb, of course, the solventless.
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:29.700]  We got super lemon haze over here.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.300]  This one is called Creek Kush because obviously I like those Kush turps.
[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:35.260]  I've been going super heavy citrus lately.
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:38.060]  For a while, the only exception is the Durban, which is all pine.
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:43.580]  I was building up to the lemon G. There's nothing like lemon G turps.
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:47.260]  The flavor of lemon G live resin in my face.
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:51.780]  If I could only dab, I don't know that lemon G would be my one and only, but if I had to
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.220]  pick three strains that I had to dab for the rest of my life, lemon G would be in that
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:56.220]  mix.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:57.820]  I may have to replace it with lemon Jeffrey though.
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:58.820]  I'm not sure.
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:01.340]  I'd have to set them side by side, take dabs and pick about that.
[01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:02.980]  I've been going sweet for a while.
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:07.660]  I've usually got, it's been a fuel-y for a while and I just went all sweet the last six
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:08.660]  months.
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:09.660]  You like the fuel?
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:10.660]  Yep.
[01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:13.100]  That heavy diesel flavor I've loved since the early 2000s.
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:16.620]  Is that in your dabs or your flowers?
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.620]  Both.
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:18.620]  Okay.
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:22.340]  You know me, I love the sour diesel.
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:23.900]  Sour diesel live resin is so tasty.
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:26.340]  I've got a little at home right now I can treat myself with.
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:29.060]  I don't enjoy sour diesel concentrates at all.
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:32.280]  Remember one time I ended up with some sour diesel concentrates on accident and I'm pretty
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:33.280]  sure I ended up in your pocket.
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:35.780]  That gram of live resin ended up at my place.
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:36.780]  Yeah.
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:37.780]  It was delicious.
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:38.780]  I just don't care for that flavor at all.
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:39.780]  It was so good.
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:40.780]  I saved it.
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:43.860]  I've got some treats for when I did shit around the house that I didn't want to do at all.
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:44.860]  I hate to say it, but like-
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:46.260]  I'd get it done and then live resin.
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:48.060]  Some tangy or some jelly bean dabs.
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:49.900]  Oh God, I'm a junkie, bro.
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:54.540]  I've got some straw banana live resin at home that's really good.
[01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:56.780]  Strawberry banana tangy, the SBT, bro.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:00.220]  Everybody seems to be going goo goo over the strawberry banana tangy stuff from Crockett.
[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.420]  Shout out to Crockett for making killer seeds.
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:09.060]  It's funny how being a breeder and somebody that works in a large scale cultivation facility,
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:14.580]  seeing the difference in buds that are grown and plants that are grown for flower production
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:20.560]  and plants that are grown specifically for oil production, we've got a cut that we gave
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:25.180]  it to somebody in another state and they grew it.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:28.860]  Once they grew it out and saw it, they're like, fuck this plant, and they cut down all
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:33.700]  of the remaining plants of it and they sent the flowers to an extraction lab.
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.900]  That extraction lab was like, what the fuck did you send us?
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:38.980]  Some cuts that we got from our friends in Colorado.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:39.980]  That would be me.
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:43.260]  They're like, what the fuck is this shit?
[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:47.020]  The extraction lab ran it and they called the guy up, like, bro, you got to come over
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:48.020]  here.
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:49.660]  The dude went over there and he took a dab of it and he's like, this is the best fucking
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:51.220]  hash I've ever smoked.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:54.100]  This is the best hash anyone in this fucking building has ever smoked.
[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:55.100]  Do you have any more?
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:59.180]  He made a sad face because he cut down all of the fucking plants that he had.
[01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:00.740]  Luckily, I still have it.
[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:02.200]  It's still around.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:05.200]  It's still here.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.200]  It's ugly.
[01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:08.080]  We're having this conversation today.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.760]  We live in the future here.
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.400]  We forget it so often here.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:18.880]  For the rest of the country and for sure the rest of the world, when it comes to legal
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:23.960]  cannabis products or cannabis products, period, we have stuff that, I mean, if you guys went
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:28.720]  legal yesterday, you wouldn't see for five years.
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:34.680]  This limited strain will not finish for anything and it's ugly, but it makes the best oil,
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:35.680]  bro.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.120]  You're going to start seeing different types of plants grown for different things.
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:42.520]  We're growing specific shit at the grow right now that will only be made into oil.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:46.520]  We've got strains that I will never let anybody see that flower because they're ugly as shit,
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:49.040]  but the oil that comes out of it is tremendous.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.840]  It might be fucking up.
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.160]  No, we're good.
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.760]  For a while now, the hash has been stalled out.
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:59.640]  It just wax and shatter and butter and butter's just basically wax you.
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:03.520]  You kind of stumbled over, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.280]  Maybe I'm wrong for butter lovers.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.880]  I'm sorry.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.240]  But that was it.
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:12.920]  And then Live Resin came along and people really started thinking about where can we
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:14.920]  go next with this?
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:19.920]  And I love that people started playing with CO2 oil because there's a huge demand for
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.520]  that.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.960]  But then you're left with this goo in a syringe that's impossible to consume.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.800]  Back in the day, I used to hate CO2 oil.
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:30.080]  I was like, no, I hate that goopy shit.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:31.760]  And it didn't taste right.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.360]  Now they've cleaned it up.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:37.000]  Now that they've cleaned it up, the taste is pretty good.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.360]  And when it's further refined like this or separated completely and then you reconstitute
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:46.720]  it back on with your desk, like do it yourself style, it's a lot of fun.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.320]  It is a lot of fun mixing up the little cocktails for yourself.
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:53.920]  I've been just taking this shatter and dunking it straight into the turps all night.
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:55.960]  It's a long, expensive process.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.760]  You guys don't even want to know.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.760]  But it's a lot of fun.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.760]  The equipment alone, you could buy a house.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.760]  Couple of nice ones.
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:04.160]  Yeah.
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:05.160]  Yeah.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.160]  Just for the equipment.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:09.480]  But this isn't the only variety I've seen.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:13.880]  There's a local outfit that's been bringing samples by.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:18.120]  And their first two samples were epic fails.
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:24.360]  Like unmarketable, unsellable, not unsmokable, way better than shit you're going to get in
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:25.360]  Florida.
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:28.760]  Did the name of the company have a family member in the name of the company?
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:29.760]  Nope.
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:30.760]  Okay.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.520]  It was just not at all a good concentrate ready to go.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:38.840]  Nothing about it was solid.
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:45.360]  But attempts three and four were really, really nice final products that are probably going
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:48.520]  to be really popular.
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:51.240]  But I'm seeing a lot of that.
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:54.960]  There's products that we get people asking by name and stuff.
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:57.360]  I don't have people asking for the Leafs by Snoop.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.760]  I do have people asking for new styles of hash that come out every couple of weeks.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.760]  Nice.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:03.760]  Yeah.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.760]  When we send material out to...
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:07.560]  Turpex does all the extractions for us from the green and...
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:08.560]  Oh, excuse me.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.080]  Turpex does all the extractions from the Green and Healthy Wellness Garden.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:15.560]  And when we send out material, we send them a lot of fresh frozen material, but we send
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.320]  them a lot of dry material.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:20.280]  The fresh frozen, we can request.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.760]  It's obviously going to be live resin.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:22.760]  That's why it's fresh frozen.
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.280]  You didn't even dab in your coffee.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.280]  Are you just thinking about it?
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.280]  Just hit me a rant.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.280]  I was looking at the hash over there.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.280]  That looks nice.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.280]  Just got a random...
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:31.880]  We send fresh frozen material out.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:32.880]  We chop down a plant.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:33.880]  We cut it into small buds.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:36.320]  We throw those buds into freezer bags.
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.280]  Those freezer bags go directly into the freezer.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.720]  They get frozen immediately.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:45.640]  Then we run to the store and get bags of ice and put those bags of ice into a giant cooler,
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:50.640]  put that frozen material into that cooler, drive that to a location where it is then
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.560]  turned into live resin.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:56.720]  At that point, we can have it turned into live sap, live sugar.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.560]  We can almost get a live shatter from some of the strains.
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.560]  The sour diesel won't live shatter.
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:07.560]  No, but it's just two sugars.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:11.120]  Once you build a relationship with the extraction company you're working with, we have two specific
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:15.080]  extractors that we talk to a lot that work with Turpex and we can tell them what we want.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:18.680]  And they're like, that strain's not going to do that or that strain is going to do that.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:24.080]  We know that we can get triangle killer sugar and rude boy sap on consistent levels.
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:29.400]  The rude boy live resin sugar is one of my favorite fucking things to dab ever.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.920]  It is so turpid delicate.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:33.200]  The high is right where I want it.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:34.600]  Some things get you on the top of the head.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:35.760]  Some of them get you in the back of the brain.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.360]  Some of you feel on the shoulders.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.200]  This rude boy hits me right in the eyes and in the forehead and it makes me dumb.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.260]  It makes math skills go away.
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:44.260]  It just makes me goofy.
[01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:46.840]  It's like, dude, I like pot.
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.800]  I want cookies after I smoke that shit.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:49.800]  Yeah.
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:50.800]  All right.
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:51.800]  So it is the 710 episode.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:55.320]  You guys, we've been talking about 710 for a whole long time.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:58.440]  We should talk about the origin of 710.
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:01.720]  Mike, do you have any idea where the number 710 came from?
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:05.080]  Why 710 is part of this culture, part of this community?
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.640]  You flip it upside down and it spills out oil.
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:08.640]  That is true.
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:12.440]  That's because a lot of the people that started this movement were of the age where they had
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:13.440]  beepers.
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:17.160]  And that's about as far as I've bothered to follow it.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.160]  All right.
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.600]  So 710 is the new 420.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:23.280]  My friend Adam Mill coined the phrase 710 is the new 420.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.760]  Back in the day, it was all about 420.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.400]  Let's get together at 420 and smoke some weed.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.400]  Now it's 710.
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.600]  Let's get together at 710, take some dabs.
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:34.240]  If you turn 710 upside down, it does say oil.
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:39.640]  To the best of my knowledge, TaskRock is the person that created the phrase 710.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:43.800]  I think TaskRock and a couple other guys were either in a chat or on a conference call
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:45.320]  and they were talking about stuff.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:47.920]  They were like, we need something a little more bougie than 420.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:49.080]  Let's upgrade it.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:50.080]  Let's do it with the hash.
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:55.080]  Well, this was at the same time hash kids were separating from flower kids.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:56.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:01.200]  By kids, I mean like full grown adults, but you know what I mean?
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:02.200]  Right.
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:03.240]  The hustler kids.
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.520]  So that's where 710 came from.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:09.760]  710 was coined as far as I know, to the best of my knowledge, and I've done a little bit
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.760]  of research, but TaskRock and a couple other cats are the guys that coined the phrase 710.
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:15.760]  So they created 710.
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.320]  Shout out to TaskRock.
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:20.600]  TaskRock, of course, he's a rapper.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:22.000]  TaskRock has a couple of albums out.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.120]  One of my favorite songs is probably First Place.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.840]  I like Do It Again.
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:27.400]  Of course, Boil That Oil.
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:29.360]  He also does Hits From The Nail.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.440]  And TaskRock- Lots of hash related music.
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.440]  Hash related music.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:36.320]  I would like to get dabbed out and drive around and listen to some Task.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.720]  Wait, I didn't say that.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:42.080]  Hypothetically, I would like to get dabbed out and drive around as a passenger and listen
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.080]  to Task.
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:51.680]  TaskRock is also the founder, proprietor, the dude for highly educated titanium.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:52.680]  That's TaskRock.
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:57.680]  A lot of the times if you go to a Cannabis Cup event in California, Colorado, those are
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:39:58.920]  probably the ones he goes to.
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:03.200]  If you go to those Cannabis Cup events and you go to the highly educated booth to purchase
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:07.920]  some highly educated products, you are probably going to pay your money to TaskRock directly.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.920]  He will be the dude there that helps you out.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.040]  So Task is integral in the 710 community, integral in the 710 movement.
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.600]  He's been a big part of it since the beginning.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:16.600]  He's a huge supporter.
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:17.960]  Shout out to Task.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.360]  Task made up the number 710.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:21.600]  Not the number, but the phrase 710.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.680]  That mic stand might need a little bit of a-
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:25.680]  My mic got droopy.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.680]  We had to-
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:27.680]  Yeah, it just-
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:28.680]  Quick equipment.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.440]  You might need to get it on.
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:31.440]  I might just have to hold it.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:32.440]  That'll work.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:33.440]  You might need to give it a minute.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.440]  Just give it a minute.
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.440]  Give it a Gatorade.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.440]  I got you, buddy.
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:37.440]  Don't worry, Mike.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:38.440]  There happens to be Gatorade on the table.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.440]  Yeah, just give it a rest.
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.440]  It'll be all right.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:41.440]  Just don't talk about it.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.440]  Just don't look at it.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.440]  It'll be fine.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.440]  Just ignore it for a minute.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.440]  It'll work again in a second.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.440]  All right.
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.440]  So shout out to our boy, TaskRock.
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:48.440]  710 is a new 420.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:49.440]  Shout out to Adam Mill.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.440]  Without TaskRock, I don't know.
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:51.440]  And Big D is the person that's been there for a long time.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.440]  He's been there for a long time.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:41:02.400]  I want to give a shout out to Big D.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.520]  At the time, he was with Broadway Wellness.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.520]  He moved on to be Top Shelf Extracts.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:10.660]  Big D moved on to be the founder and proprietor of the Secret Cup.
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:14.600]  Not the Secret Sesh, the Secret Cup, the one with the dragon and the logo.
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.920]  The first hash competition I think I ever attended.
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:19.040]  First one I ever heard about.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.040]  Yeah.
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.040]  Yeah.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.040]  So I think Task.
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:25.560]  Big D, I think Adam Mill, the guys from Healthstone Glass.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:28.240]  And of course, I'm going to give a little bit of credit to Hitman Glass Dougie because
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.360]  he does make the rigs that a lot of us are purchasing and smoking our hash through.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:37.480]  So a lot of those guys are pioneers of the industry, old school folks.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:43.120]  In Colorado, in the hash movement, Spence did a lot.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:46.840]  I want to give a huge shout out to Spence and the Garden of Weeden crew.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:49.560]  Kind Bill, that whole crew, they did a lot in the hash.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:55.080]  Honestly, we all owe a huge high five to Derek Cummings.
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:56.080]  Fuck Derek.
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.080]  That dude did so much for hash.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.080]  I know that's funny.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.080]  It's an inside joke, but hashtag fuck Derek.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.880]  It's just kind of an inside joke with all of his friends.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.000]  But Derek did a lot for learning about hash.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.960]  Derek did a lot of research and learned a whole lot of shit.
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:11.880]  And then of course, there's Tony V. There's a whole bunch of guys doing stuff for hash
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:13.040]  and Terps.
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.440]  But shout out to all the people that helped get 710 popular, originated that shit, Task
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.440]  Rock.
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:21.040]  And then there's the original people.
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:27.520]  There's so many people involved in keeping it as what it is today.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:29.200]  It's been fun to watch it grow.
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:30.200]  It goes so rapidly.
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:34.520]  Now that it's legal, that we can do whatever we want with this, the equipment, the products
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:38.280]  have just every couple of months, I got to go buy all new shit just to have what I need
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:40.160]  to have to be on top of things.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:42.520]  It's like any other tech right now.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:48.600]  Every six months, it evolves two to three times faster and more effective than it was
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:49.600]  before.
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:50.600]  The Terps are available by themselves now.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.120]  And it's in every part of the legal marijuana industry, which is fun to watch.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:58.320]  We got a huge variety of products about a year and a half ago.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:03.320]  They're all getting really, really, really good now.
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:05.160]  It's just so much fun to see.
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:08.080]  You guys got to legalize it where you live.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.400]  Remember when I was like the only one that had little jars of Terps on the table?
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.880]  Yeah, you probably will be for a while.
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:15.680]  There's a lot of people out there now.
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:17.240]  They're available at a lot of shops.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:20.120]  A lot of people are eating them up.
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.120]  Eating them up.
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.600]  It's a whole new thing.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.680]  I really love it.
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.640]  A lot of people are probably like, where the fuck are Terps?
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:27.640]  Terps are terpenoids.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:36.160]  Terpenoids are the compounds that mainly provide the flavor and aroma to your cannabis and
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:38.120]  or cannabis concentrates.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:41.400]  They're part of the flavor.
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:43.720]  The paleates and the esters have a lot to do with the flavor.
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:47.800]  The flavonoids have a lot to do with the flavor, obviously, but the terpenoids are mainly what
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:50.800]  play the part of the flavor that work on your tongue.
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:52.280]  That's mostly the part that you get.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.240]  They also contribute to your high.
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.360]  I think that the OG Kush one makes me a little more mellow.
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:58.360]  It gives me a body thing.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.040]  It kind of makes my body go, wonk, wonk, wonk, wonk, wonk.
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:06.680]  And the Ghost Train Haze makes my head go, like I just dabbed a fucking bottle rocket.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:12.120]  Well, essentially, that's what separates Indica from Sativa is what you've refined into that
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.320]  tiny little jar.
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:18.920]  It's everything around the THC.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:23.000]  There's some other stuff that goes into that, but yeah.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.600]  If you had to describe somebody to somebody, if you had to show them strongly, this is
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.320]  the difference between Indica and Sativa.
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:31.040]  That would definitely be a good way to do it.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.120]  Just take that and just let them try that.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.960]  Those two examples, one's a heavy Sativa, one's a heavy Indica.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:37.240]  Oh, you're way too high.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:38.240]  Watch, try this one.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.240]  Just put them to bed with the OG Kush.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:43.720]  No, if their problem was I'm way too high, I wouldn't give them another dab.
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:48.040]  No, I'd give them a dab of some really CBD heavy, yeah, some CBD heavy dabs.
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:49.040]  They would call them the fuck down.
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.040]  Enjoy the cherry flavor, bud.
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:52.200]  All right.
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:54.160]  All this talk about dabs has got me wanting to dab.
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:58.640]  So I've got some of this Mob Boss Shatter and I've dunked it into some Ghost Train Haze
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.640]  Terps.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:00.920]  You can see the Terps on the tip of the dab.
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:03.000]  It just looks like a little wet spot on there.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.520]  I'm going to take a dab.
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.560]  Mike, tell all of our listeners how they can find you on social media and make sure
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:11.080]  you include your Facebook group.
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:18.880]  You can catch me at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook or at Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:19.880]  And that dab was massive.
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:20.880]  He's going to turn colors right now.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:21.880]  It's going to be beautiful.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:22.880]  I'm not even going to joke, bro.
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:23.880]  I'm going to keep talking.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:27.440]  No, but you can turn colors without joking.
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:30.240]  I see now he's pasty white.
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:31.240]  Now he's going to red.
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:32.240]  It's a proper set of 10.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.080]  There'll be a shade of purple here in a couple seconds.
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:35.640]  I feel it coming.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:36.640]  Nice dark red and then purple.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.640]  Terps.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:38.640]  I do it for the Terps.
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:39.640]  I like to get Terpy.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.640]  It doesn't even smell good.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:42.560]  Oh, it tastes amazing.
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:43.960]  It's just like having...
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:47.800]  I've always described haze strains and the Ghost Train Haze is really...
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:49.600]  It definitely stands out for what I'm talking about.
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.480]  There's like a velvet thing that happens on your tongue.
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:52.480]  It just feels like...
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:55.480]  Like, you know when you smell lilacs or lavender?
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:57.600]  There's that specific thing.
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:01.600]  It almost has a similar coating like that that happens, but it's more enjoyable to me
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.160]  because I fucking hate lilacs and lavender for some reason.
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.640]  I don't like the smell of that shit.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:08.640]  It makes my nose feel like I got particles in my nose when I smell lilacs.
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.640]  Yeah, I don't like lavender when I'm surprised with it.
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:12.640]  Like, if we check into a hotel- I coughed.
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:13.640]  Did you hear that?
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:14.640]  And we get up to the room and it's all over.
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:15.640]  I coughed.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:16.640]  It drives me fucking nuts.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:17.640]  Yeah.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.640]  There's probably worse shit in that hotel room than that lavender, bro.
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:23.240]  Well, no, I know, but it's the lavender that I've like choked on and can feel in my mouth
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:26.200]  for like the next hour.
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:27.200]  It definitely has a coating.
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:28.200]  I don't know.
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:30.200]  Maybe we're just equally high.
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:31.800]  All right.
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:32.800]  Shout out to 710.
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:33.800]  Shout out to TASC.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:37.280]  There's something else I want to talk about on this episode that is not really DAB related,
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:42.320]  not really 710 related, but it needs to be mentioned.
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.320]  Amendment 139.
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.320]  Current event.
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.960]  Bum, bum, bum.
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:48.800]  There was a group, I don't know exactly who put this petition out.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:56.800]  There was a group that was petitioning to limit all cannabis products to 16% THC.
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:57.800]  That's right.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:04.120]  So, if you grow at Green and Healthy Wellness, this shit tests anywhere from 20 to 30% THC.
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:06.200]  Nothing is lower than 22, I wouldn't guess.
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:11.160]  The average THC content in Colorado is 18.
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.160]  Really?
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.160]  Who the fuck is growing that shit?
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.160]  Step it up, people.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.160]  Step it up.
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:22.080]  No, there's actually a pretty solid demand for stuff that's between like 12 and 16%.
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:27.360]  People that retired after 35 years doing shit they were drug tested for, they really don't
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:31.280]  want our moonshine potency weed.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:34.920]  They freak out when they try to roll a joint of it and smoke it like they did back in 1974.
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.160]  Oh no, just take a couple puffs and put that fucker out.
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:41.760]  Yeah, but they like the whole pass it back and forth with their wife or whatever.
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:43.080]  I have a friend who writes.
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:45.760]  Yeah, so they like stuff that they can smoke on a little bit more.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:47.960]  Just smoke on it and just have it burning while he's writing.
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:48.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:53.720]  So, there is a call for that, but the average is 18.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:57.040]  Estimates are that this should have shut down 80% of the industry as we know it right now.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:01.240]  I would move to a place where I could grow high quality cannabis.
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:04.200]  Well, no, immediately all conscience rates gone.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.200]  Most of the edibles gone.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.200]  Most of the strains on the shelf gone.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.200]  Dabs.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:08.200]  We couldn't have dabs.
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:13.080]  Most of the vapor cartridges gone.
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:16.960]  What's the point of a vapor cart that's 16%?
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:20.000]  That would fuel the black market so well.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.320]  Yep.
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:27.680]  And that's the design is the people that were behind it wanted it to kill the industry.
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:35.760]  They know that a public vote to end Amendment 64 statewide would die laughably.
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:41.880]  And so, this was their more reasonable attempt to give voters to go along with gutting the
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:42.880]  industry.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.440]  So, there were three parts to this.
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:48.160]  They were going to add childproof packaging, which we already do.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:52.600]  They wanted us to add a health warning that said this causes irreparable brain damage
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:53.600]  or some shit.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.720]  Fuck that.
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:57.920]  We already do health warnings that are reasonable.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:02.000]  We're willing to add more reasonable health warnings, but we're not willing to add some
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.480]  random bullshit that you just thought of.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:09.040]  And then it was going to limit potency to 16%.
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:15.000]  The group behind this claims they have 80% of the public support on this.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.360]  What public where?
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:20.560]  They won't tell you, but they're pretty sure it exists somewhere.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.520]  They definitely didn't ask any dad kids.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:26.680]  I think it's 80% of the people at the last anti-pot meeting.
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.640]  But 80% of the people in Parker.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:29.640]  That's just from...
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:37.160]  Shout out to my hometown.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:41.840]  They really, really hate marijuana and they wanted to shut us down this way.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.520]  They claim they have a huge amount of support, which is nonsense.
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:49.880]  They withdrew their effort today.
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:53.120]  They essentially said they're going to stop trying.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.760]  And the reason they stopped trying is kind of funny.
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:04.040]  They claim that the group of marijuana industry supporters and businesses that formed to oppose
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:09.560]  this effort called up all of the petition signature gathering companies in Colorado
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:16.040]  that are good at what they do and can actually get a statewide ballot effort on the signatures
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:19.400]  collected because it's like 100,000 or 98,000 signatures.
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.480]  It's a lot.
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:24.800]  There are companies in Colorado that can definitely get that done for you.
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:27.760]  Apparently, they all got a phone call from the marijuana people and they're like, we're
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:28.760]  going to hire you for this.
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:29.760]  Here's what you got to do.
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:30.760]  Nothing.
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:31.760]  Go ahead and bill us.
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:32.760]  And just hung up the phone.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:41.640]  And they raised enough money to apparently make that offer to the two biggest companies
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:43.640]  or three biggest companies in Colorado.
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:46.680]  And on the off chance, the anti-pop people tried to hire all three.
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:49.680]  They were prepared to pay all three to do nothing.
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:53.560]  And so the anti-pop people were like, well, if we have to fucking do this ourselves, let's
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.360]  go ahead and not do it.
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:56.360]  Nice.
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:59.680]  Which makes me laugh, especially when they're like, well, we have an 80% support of the
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:00.680]  public.
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:01.680]  Oh my God.
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:02.680]  Then it's so easy.
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:05.240]  They kind of played old school drug dealer tactics though.
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:06.240]  I like that.
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:12.080]  You just pop it up on Facebook and you say, hey, community that supports this so much,
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:16.640]  we need all of you to grab a signature and take it to work the next day and say, hey,
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:17.640]  sign this.
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:18.640]  80% of the public.
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:19.640]  It's just such nonsense.
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:20.640]  Yeah.
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:22.640]  They didn't have 80% of the shit.
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:23.640]  No.
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:29.040]  And then they claimed that the marijuana industry raised tens of millions of dollars to do this.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.960]  And this shit's public.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:35.080]  All you have to do is know where to Google and you can check how much they raised.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:36.080]  It's like 400 grand.
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:39.480]  The sad part is that if you handed a petition to most people and you're like, hey, would
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:42.520]  you like to limit the THC and cannabis to 16%?
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:46.320]  People are like, I don't even know what the fuck that means.
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:47.320]  Sure.
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.320]  They just signed.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.320]  Like stop bugging me.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:50.320]  If I sign, will you stop bugging me?
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:52.560]  Would you quit ringing that fucking bell if I signed this?
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:53.560]  Yep.
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:54.560]  Yeah.
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:56.640]  That sucks that people are just willing to sign shit too without even knowing what they're
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:57.640]  talking about.
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:03.680]  And by law, you have to print the actual language that you're asking people to sign for across
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:05.680]  the top of the sheet they sign.
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:07.240]  It can't be a separate page or nothing.
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.720]  Like there's a lot of rules.
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:12.760]  A lot of the people, we've discussed this before on the show.
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:15.760]  A lot of the people at Walmart are in their pajamas.
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:21.320]  We'll know who reads it even when you're out really collecting this stuff and trying to
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:22.360]  get people to give a shit.
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.360]  No one reads it.
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.360]  Yeah.
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:25.360]  They're just in a fucking hurry.
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.360]  They want to sign it and get you the hell out of there.
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:27.360]  Are you a resident?
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:29.080]  Yeah.
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:30.080]  You're 18, sign here, sign here.
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:31.080]  Yep.
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:32.080]  That's pretty much what you get.
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:33.080]  For the most part.
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:34.080]  All right.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.080]  So that shit got dropped.
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.080]  It did not pass you guys.
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:37.080]  It gave up because-
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:38.080]  It's done.
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:46.200]  The group behind it is, has pledged to reform as a broader coalition of people uniting to
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:47.440]  fuck over the marijuana industry.
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:49.560]  I was going to say that just sounds like a whole bunch of bullshit.
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:53.660]  A bunch of big words that they're lawyer type for them.
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:57.900]  The funny part is a big part of their press release today, they're like, well, this former
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:04.940]  high school principal who was behind this said this, and this local parent who's behind, the
[01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:09.340]  other person behind this said this. And I'm sitting there reading a press release from a
[01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:15.500]  major anti-marijuana personality in Oregon. And the press release talks about major funding from
[01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:19.900]  a national anti-marijuana group. And then if you keep reading the article, it talks about the
[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:25.180]  actual people behind the initiative who aren't these local lovable characters like a teacher and
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:32.220]  a parent. They're major politicians from around the country who make a living doing stuff like this,
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:37.820]  but they're able to portray it as like, oh, there's just these little folks being picked
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:43.260]  on by big industry marijuana. It's like, do you threatened a billion dollar industry and
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:46.860]  they raised 300 grand to knock you out of the fight? Like, come on now.
[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:50.620]  So you just gave me a perfect segue. Before we start wrapping up the show,
[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:56.540]  give me an update on what is going on with the effort to eliminate and or eradicate recreational
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:54:02.300]  cannabis from Pueblo County. Okay. So locally, our petition effort has
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:09.020]  been significantly more successful than the ones statewide. They have all their signatures turned
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:14.540]  in. It looks like they've got more than enough valid signatures to make the ballot. There's two
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:20.300]  questions in front of the courts right now. The first question is how many signatures they should
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:27.180]  have collected. They collected 5% of the voter signatures from that last election down here,
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:35.020]  which was like 5,000 signatures. They collected 9,000 almost. And so they're covered there if
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:42.300]  it's 5%. But recently a bill was passed at the state level requiring this specific question,
[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:48.620]  if it's going to be put on a ballot anywhere, to have 15% of past voter signatures,
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:56.220]  which would jack that number to around 14 or 15,000, which means they don't have near enough
[01:54:56.220 --> 01:55:01.820]  signatures gathered and they need to get back out there and gather signatures. That decision should
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:09.660]  come any day now. Well, it's Friday when we're recording this. It'll be Sunday when it comes out.
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:15.500]  So it'll probably be within four or five days of this coming out when we get that decision,
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:19.180]  hopefully, maybe as many as 15. But if you're Rasta Seb, this will be Monday
[01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:26.220]  because he's from the future, bae. He's from the future. But hopefully within seven or 10 days,
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:32.460]  we get that first decision about what percentage of the vote they should have gathered. Odds are
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:39.260]  strong that the judge is going to rule that 5% is fine. Recently, we had a local politician make a
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:46.220]  primary ballot and it ended up in front of the same judge. And the judge's ruling was, yes,
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:49.740]  he failed to follow the law here and here. Yes, he broke that rule there,
[01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:54.620]  but elections are about choices and why not give you guys him as one of those choices?
[01:55:55.260 --> 01:56:03.260]  And a lot of people were like, wait, what, really? But kind of, I guess. The judge gets
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:09.660]  to make the rules. It's why they wear the outfit. It's why they have the job. So let them make them.
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:13.900]  And that was the decision they made. So we're kind of expecting the same thing here.
[01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:18.460]  There's another court issue that involves some serious campaign finance stuff
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:24.940]  that could really keep them off the ballot. Colorado and pretty much every state in the
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:32.140]  union has very serious laws that govern their elections. When you would like to put something
[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:37.580]  on an official election ballot, there are rules you must follow. The anti-marijuana people down
[01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:44.860]  here are terrible at following rules. It's a very fun character trait for them to have if you're me.
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:50.460]  So as soon as they said they were running a public ballot, I was hoping for, well,
[01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:55.180]  like, well, this is complicated. There's a lot of important ins and outs. And if you can't handle a
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:57:01.900]  licensing hearing at the county level, running a county-wide ballot issue is probably going to trip
[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:09.260]  you up. And it looks like it has. One of the things is you can't raise money in a jar at a
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:15.100]  fundraiser. That's not a thing in politics. If there's donations over $20, I got to get your
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:20.620]  name. I got to get your serial number. And that's just how elections go. The money is tracked like
[01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:27.580]  that unless you're super rich. And by which case, you can donate hundreds of millions of dollars to
[01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:32.140]  a company to run evil attack ads and shit, and that's fine. But if you're a little guy trying
[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:36.540]  to give $24, you got to give me your name and your serial number. You can't just throw a jar
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:41.340]  up on the piano and at the end of the night have 300 or 1,000 bucks in there and call it good
[01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:49.420]  enough. So they did that twice. And then there's major polling that they've bragged about. And
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:56.700]  most people don't understand what kind of money is involved when you poll people in a county like
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:58:01.820]  Pueblo. We're not a big county. There's only 150,000 people down here. A poll like that still
[01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:12.140]  costs 10, 15, 20, $25,000. The good ones cost 25, 35, $40,000. The ones that'll really give you the
[01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:17.180]  information you want are expensive. They did one of these. They paid for one of these. We know all
[01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:22.780]  about it. And for some reason, they're lying about it. That's going to play out really interestingly
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:30.140]  in court. Do we have access to the truth on those surveys? We don't know what the results they got
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:35.100]  back, but we know they bragged about them enough to the local hospitals, for the local hospitals
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:41.260]  to put literature together that referenced the polling done. We know who did the poll.
[01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:47.420]  We know who paid for the poll. We know who probably got handed the check that paid for the
[01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:53.340]  poll. We know who probably cashed it. It's disturbing that they're lying about it. All
[01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:56.380]  they had to do was put it on their campaign finance report and nobody gives a shit.
[01:58:57.580 --> 01:59:00.700]  But they didn't. And then they keep claiming to the press that they didn't.
[01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:06.460]  And eventually, the judge is going to want to know why. And that's an issue that could keep
[01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:09.820]  them off the ballot too. Same thing with the money in the jars. That's a big enough screw
[01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:16.620]  up to keep you off the ballot. If you want to make law, you got to follow law. It's really that simple.
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:20.860]  Did they hire a lawyer? They did. It's their main volunteer. He's
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:25.740]  donated like 10 or $12,000 worth of lawyer hours to their effort.
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:28.860]  Like six hours? I have no idea what he charges,
[01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:31.980]  but that's on their campaign finance reports. Wow. Okay.
[01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:38.860]  I've spent a disturbing amount of time going through those reports. It's fun to work on
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:42.940]  campaigns. I'm sure. The look on your face when you talk about it is great.
[01:59:43.180 --> 01:59:53.420]  It's fun. It very well could be the death of Pueblo. We really can't handle the loss this
[01:59:53.420 --> 01:59:59.980]  would be to our community. We were on the edge for a while. Parts of town are still very, very bad.
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:06.540]  Crime is a huge problem. Infrastructure spending is a huge problem. If we lose 60%
[02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:11.980]  of our construction industry, 1,300 marijuana jobs, all of the expansion that industry's supposed
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:17.900]  to go through over the next several years, all of that real estate floods back onto the market.
[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:23.740]  That's a death blow. All those people that moved here because
[02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:28.700]  somebody like myself had a job and was like, I need a helper. And I got somebody that I know in
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:32.460]  another state that I trust, brought them out here, those people and myself would be fucked.
[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:37.420]  You'd be fucked. Well, there's a huge number. I worked with five people that moved here within
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:44.540]  the last year. How many people are employed by the spot? 30, 35. That's one dispensary. How many
[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:51.900]  of them are there in Pueblo West? A hundred licenses. It's 1,300 people.
[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:59.340]  Literally, if this vote passes, 1,300 people are out of work. It's a full 1% of our population
[02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:04.940]  down here. You add that immediately to the unemployment rolls. And then you compound
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:10.700]  that with all of... It's not like I got fired for stealing. It's 1,300 people got put out of work
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:17.580]  because an industry closed. No one gets to apply for the job I just lost. All of us are now applying
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:22.060]  for whatever jobs were currently available when our industry shut down. What percentage of those
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:26.300]  people go home and buy a bunch of fucking lights with their first unemployment check and build a
[02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:32.380]  black market, grow and start flipping black market weed? Well, I figure half of what... We do about
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:37.660]  20 million in annual sales down here. I figure half of that immediately goes back into the black
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:41.660]  market. And the other half goes either up the highway to Colorado Springs or down the highway
[02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:48.700]  to Trinidad. The tourist money goes to Trinidad and Manitou. The medical money goes to Colorado
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:53.660]  Springs. Everybody who doesn't feel like that's an effort worth putting in for a bag of weed
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:57.420]  just goes back to the black market. Yeah. Just put some seeds in the dirt in the basement.
[02:01:57.420 --> 02:02:01.980]  Immediately. Shine some lights on that bitch. We lose out on 5 million in tax revenue next year.
[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:06.780]  That's paying for all kinds of cool shit that wasn't getting paid for before because we didn't
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:10.220]  have the money. The city's starting to look decent. It's clean. It's getting cleaned up.
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:14.060]  The potholes are going away. It's starting to look- Little by little, it's getting more...
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:19.580]  I noticed that the last street I drive on on my way to your place, it's really just got repaved.
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:23.740]  Yeah, they just repaved the whole street. And that thing's been jacked since I've known about Pueblo.
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:29.100]  Yep. That whole boulevard's been wrecked. Pot for potholes. It's working.
[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:33.500]  It really does work. It's just little by little. It takes a minute. People are like,
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:38.780]  why aren't our schools perfect? We've had legal weed for two years. Why aren't all our streets
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:43.180]  perfect? It's been two years. It just takes a minute. Do you have any info on the scholarship
[02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:46.620]  that was awarded to the child via the governor? The governor doubled it.
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:53.580]  Boom. If I was king of the world, the scholarship would be bigger and spendable in more places.
[02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:59.180]  But it's still really awesome. We're sending 25 kids to college that probably wouldn't have
[02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:02.220]  been able to go without that two grand. Explain a little bit how that happened
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:08.300]  to people that haven't kept up at all. Our local county commissioners, the voters pass
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:13.020]  the local excise tax. So all of the production, when you grow marijuana and then sell it to a
[02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:19.820]  retail store, it gets taxed at that point. And that money goes into kind of a slush fund for
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:26.940]  dream projects we couldn't pay for before. When I grow the flowers at Green and Healthy Wellness,
[02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:33.820]  they have to be packaged and then transferred to the store. That's where the tax happens?
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:39.820]  Yep. If it was in Pueblo County, that's where the tax would happen. When Colorado Springs passes an
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:46.060]  excise tax on medical, then it'll happen there. But we already did that down here for REC.
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:50.940]  And so that's going to be... This is the first year that tax has been in effect.
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:58.060]  So money's just starting to trickle in, but we expect $3.5 million from that excise tax this year.
[02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:02.380]  And that's the bulk of the marijuana taxes that Pueblo County is going to make next year.
[02:04:03.340 --> 02:04:09.260]  We get 3.5 from the excise tax-ish. It's an estimate so far. We'll see how it actually plans
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:15.660]  out. And then we're definitely going to get 1.7 to 1.8 in licensing fees and sales tax.
[02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:19.500]  If the industry exists?
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:26.060]  Well, no, that's through the end of this year. So even if the election goes against this in November,
[02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:35.900]  we still get to operate until next November. Your licenses can expire as it comes up for expiration
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:47.900]  until November, 2017. So the shop that gets their license in November the 1st of this year
[02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:52.860]  is in the best shape to operate as long as possible, regardless of the election outcome.
[02:04:54.780 --> 02:05:02.380]  Hopefully that made sense. But it's just a death blow to us. We're doing so much with...
[02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:09.500]  It's not a lot compared to our whole county budget. But the problem with our county budget
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:15.660]  is that it passed its breaking point a couple million dollars ago. And we just have to look at
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:20.220]  middle school kids walking in the middle of the street with the buses and the car traffic and go,
[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:23.340]  sorry, no money for sidewalks. Or crossing guards.
[02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:24.620]  Or crossing guards. Or books.
[02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:31.420]  Yeah. All kinds of stuff. We took asbestos out of a couple of schools. And I read that
[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:35.900]  in the newspaper and I was like, asbestos in schools, it's fucking 2016. Oh, it's hurting my
[02:05:35.900 --> 02:05:42.140]  face. Ow. And I just had to think about it. No, that was way down in San Juan County because
[02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:47.660]  that's how we're spending that. The state also collects an excise tax. And the first 40 million
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:54.460]  from that fund goes to school construction through our state's best program. And the best program,
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:59.180]  literally when you apply for it, you explain how your school districts broke, how they've never
[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:04.300]  had money since the 40s and how you badly need to do stuff that should have been done 30 years
[02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:09.740]  ago, but you've never found a way to pay for it. And so they're doing stuff like taking the lead
[02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:15.820]  out of the pipes, taking the asbestos out of the gym. Putting pads in the playground.
[02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:23.500]  Yeah. Or building a playground, period. Paving the road to it. All kinds of crazy stuff that
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:29.020]  we really should have done decades ago, but just never had the money and we were never going to
[02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:34.940]  have it. And now we can fund it with weed money because it's just enough more than what we need
[02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:39.900]  to do everything else that wasn't getting funded. So loop us back around to the scholarships.
[02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:45.180]  So sorry. The scholarships, they gave each kid that wanted up to 400 kids, a thousand bucks.
[02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:52.460]  400 kids got a thousand bucks? Well, that was the offer. Only 25 ended up applying.
[02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:57.980]  Part of the reason for that is you have to be a Pueblo high school graduate and we had way more
[02:06:57.980 --> 02:07:06.380]  than 25 of those dicks. Anyone thinking that? But you had to go to college in Pueblo County.
[02:07:07.100 --> 02:07:11.100]  And so, yeah, if I was king of the world, it'd be at least anywhere in Colorado.
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:12.780]  Right. Because Nebraska don't need my fucking weed money.
[02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:14.460]  They just want to keep the money in the county.
[02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:18.300]  Yeah. They just wanted to keep it in the county. They wanted to promote the local university.
[02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:22.620]  And there's a lot of cool things happening down here at our local university. So why not keep
[02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:27.340]  it all local? There's a good music program, a good mass comm program, but I don't know about
[02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:32.860]  other stuff. The governor liked the program so much he used state marijuana taxes to double it
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:39.580]  to two grand. And I mean, honestly, that's books for a whole year. That's meals for most of a whole
[02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:45.660]  year or half a year. It depends on how you... Well, no, I was a college student. So some of
[02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:51.740]  these numbers aren't real unrealistic. They might just be a decade old, sorry. But I mean,
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:56.380]  $2,000 down here in Pueblo, that's fully the difference between I'm able to go and I'm not
[02:07:56.380 --> 02:08:01.580]  able to go. And honestly, if $2,000 is going to really make or break that difference, like
[02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:07.020]  college in New York or wherever else, I'd be happy to send you with that two grand.
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:11.900]  Probably wasn't a make or break anyway. It requires a lot more to live out of state than
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:18.380]  it does in your hometown. Yeah. You'd still stay with the fam. Oh, for sure. That takes out a huge
[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:25.420]  amount of expense. Huge amount, yeah. But it's a fantastic program and the anti-pop people are all
[02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:29.500]  over it. They're like, this is just propaganda. And it's like, we're making sure that more kids
[02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:33.260]  get to go to college. It's that simple. It's not propaganda when that kid goes to college.
[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:37.900]  How is that propaganda? It's some real shit. One of the things people won't refuse to accept
[02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:42.620]  is that marijuana was always here in a way that's so much larger than anyone really wants
[02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:52.220]  to admit. I mean, it's 60 billion coast to coast. Six, zero billion. I mean, that's a huge amount
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:58.620]  of money. I don't think anybody can fathom that much cash. I mean, yeah. In $20 bills, it's a
[02:08:58.620 --> 02:09:03.660]  couple of high schools full probably. I don't know. But it's an insane amount of money. Two
[02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:09.180]  Olympic pools just stuffed with hundreds. It's all just under the surface. It's your neighbor's
[02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:13.820]  house. It's the park your kids play at. It's the school your kids go to. It's even the fucking
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:19.100]  prisons. Prohibition doesn't work at all. It's right under our noses. It always has been and
[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:25.580]  always will be. It's just mostly invisible. The only people who are able to be visible with it
[02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:31.900]  are the people with nothing to lose. And no one's willing to admit that in Colorado anymore.
[02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:37.980]  Everybody's like it's new, especially the anti-pop people. And all we did was shift where
[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:42.620]  people buy it. And we're able to do so many cool things with that money. Because it's a legit
[02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:46.780]  industry now. We can make turps because now we got science. You don't have to be afraid to go.
[02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:50.700]  If you get caught buying the equipment that it takes to make these turps at the store,
[02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:53.900]  they'd turn you in for making a fucking meth lab back in the day. And then it can be like,
[02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:56.860]  no, we're with this dispensary and we need all this equipment to make hash.
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:10:03.020]  And now you can do that. And we can more effectively treat patients. Everyone forgets
[02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:06.780]  about the patients. We're all about getting turped out now. I used to spend the first 20
[02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:14.060]  minutes with a new big fat bag of weed looking for mold, looking for mildew, looking for washers.
[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:20.940]  Spider eggs. All kinds of nasty funks. Yeah. I've gotten toenails in a week before.
[02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:24.860]  Sit there breaking out bud and have a bug crawl out of the nugget up your arm.
[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:31.740]  Like it was, it's shit we used to put up with. And the fact that it's all gone now,
[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:39.100]  like there's the benefit stream just, it's endless. It's so far past the money, but for a
[02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:43.980]  place like Pueblo, the money's vital. Does South of us, the town even smaller, the sheriff was in
[02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:48.380]  the paper. Like I wasn't sure what to think at first. Now I love it. Look what it's done to
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:52.940]  the downtown area. Yeah. Yeah. They've built a river walk down there because of cannabis money.
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:59.580]  Trinidad's not going to die now. Yeah. Pueblo was, we had steel here and steel isn't as big as it
[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:03.340]  used to be. People want to go lightweight now. So it's titanium and we don't have a titanium mill.
[02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:08.940]  We have a steel mill. And so people were leaving and people don't want to work at a steel mill
[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:12.300]  forever. Now it's kind of the technology era. People are getting the fuck out of here.
[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:16.780]  It's that was going bad. I've lived here for a long time. Mike and I have been here. We were
[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:20.940]  here before all the cannabis shit happened. And I have seen this town. It was kind of a little,
[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:25.580]  little cow town when I moved here. It's flourishing. Like it's actually going
[02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:30.540]  somewhere now. I'm kind of proud. We're finally crawling out of the funk. We were in for like 40
[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:39.900]  years. The flood fucked us up. I mean, honestly, it was when the steel mill started to slow down.
[02:11:41.580 --> 02:11:46.700]  A whole huge generation of people didn't have an easy way to feed their families down here.
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:51.820]  It wasn't easy to find work anymore. You really had to work at it. When I moved here,
[02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:57.580]  you had to know somebody that was hiring. Period. That's how this town is. This is one of those
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:00.860]  towns where you could fill out a thousand applications and unless you know somebody
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:04.700]  here, you're not going to get a job. Most of the job and housing listings
[02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:09.980]  never make it online here. It's you drive up and down the streets you want to live on and look for
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:14.380]  someone putting out a for rent sign and walk up and talk to that person before it sits out there
[02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:19.580]  too long. It's the same thing with jobs. You heard a friend of yours got fired, wander into
[02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:24.380]  wherever they used to work and talk to the manager stat because otherwise there ain't no job for you
[02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:31.100]  in the city. That's slowly changing now. We have hiring or staffing agencies now that help people
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:37.020]  get a foothold in the marijuana industry. We have an industry down here that's going to need
[02:12:37.020 --> 02:12:43.900]  a hundred more trimmers next year. The real downside is that we're not
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:46.940]  publicizing in all 50 states what it takes to work in this industry.
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:53.580]  But people think that they can show up late and take a shit and be 20 minutes late and hang out.
[02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:57.740]  I talk to people every day that are shocked to learn it's like a real business.
[02:12:57.740 --> 02:13:01.100]  Yeah. They think you can just hang out and smoke joints all day and fuck off.
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:07.020]  They thought their high school weed dealer had a snore now where he just hung out and played
[02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:11.900]  Xbox and then waited at his table and then you gave him money and it was weird and then they'd
[02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:17.660]  leave. They walk in and they see what looks basically like an Apple store or a purse or
[02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:21.900]  shoe store in the mall. You just gave me a chance to tease something that we're going to talk about
[02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:25.900]  on a future episode. I want to wait until you and Lindsay are here. We're going to talk about the
[02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:31.340]  weirdest shit that people have ever done in a dispensary. I was asked to do that episode today
[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:35.820]  by someone at work who listened to the dispensary etiquette episode. Oh, nice. Nice. We're going to
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:41.020]  talk about that when Linds is available. Lins just got back from a little vacation and she took the
[02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:45.500]  night off. She was invited, but she needed a nappy poo. So she's cuddled up with Scooby.
[02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:52.300]  What up Scoob? What's up Scoobs? Good boy. Shout out to that air conditioner over there.
[02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:55.740]  But we're going to get Lins on and we're going to talk about some weird shit that's
[02:13:55.740 --> 02:13:59.820]  happened in dispensaries. I've got a pretty good story myself. Dude, dispensaries are awesome.
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:04.780]  It's a really magical place where banana ramek shit happens on the regular.
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:09.740]  Still. Remember when we had a store way back in the wild fucking west days? Some of the crazy
[02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:13.820]  shit that would happen. We got to save those stories. I'm so excited. I got a cheesy ass
[02:14:13.820 --> 02:14:19.340]  grin on my face because we ran the place before you could get a weed card. Back in the day,
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:23.180]  you could walk in and go, my leg hurts. I need weed card. And they'd say, how much money you
[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:26.060]  got? And you'd tell them they'd write you that many plants. Like, here you go. Have a great
[02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:31.500]  fucking day. They didn't even care back then. Like weed card for sale. Well, that was in the
[02:14:31.500 --> 02:14:38.060]  very first days. Even the doctors were at the fringe of society because the DEA was still
[02:14:38.060 --> 02:14:43.340]  threatening that if a doctor wrote a recommendation for marijuana in Colorado, that they could lose
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:50.700]  their DEA license to write prescriptions for anything, any other drug. And so the doctors
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:56.620]  that were like the first five doctors in Colorado to sign paperwork period were the kind of doctors
[02:14:56.620 --> 02:15:01.180]  where like, if you were there because you fell on something and it went through like your forearm or
[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:05.980]  your leg, you'd start talking to them. And after 15 minutes or so, you'd be like, you know what?
[02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:13.180]  Don't, doc, I'm just going to the next doc up the road. Sorry. Like, I don't care that I'm impaled
[02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:18.700]  for something that's not going to kill me immediately. But that changed six months later
[02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:22.620]  when they stopped hounding doctors. Remember that weird ass doc that used to come to-
[02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:25.580]  With the ponytail? Yeah, with the ponytail.
[02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:29.180]  No, that was the husband. The husband had a ponytail and a cane. The doctor was the woman
[02:15:29.180 --> 02:15:32.780]  who wouldn't look you in the eye. Oh no, I'm talking about the crazy guy and the crazy wife.
[02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:34.860]  They used to come together. Yeah.
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:37.740]  Okay. Is that, okay. Yeah. Well, let's see. I was working at a dispensary.
[02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:41.180]  The lady that owned that dispensary used to bake edibles and she would show up with trays of
[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:43.580]  edibles and she'd be like, Mike and Jeff, you have to try-
[02:15:43.580 --> 02:15:44.540]  This makes some of those days-
[02:15:44.540 --> 02:15:48.460]  This brownies, this carrot cake, this fucking banana bread, this cookie.
[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:53.180]  Here's the nine products I make. Here's your nine samples. And then you restock the shelves with the
[02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:59.020]  rest. And five minutes later, she'd go, which one did you eat? And you'd go, it's 11 AM. I'm not,
[02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:04.700]  how does it work? And she would go, well, which one are you going to eat right now in front of me?
[02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:05.580]  Yeah. She didn't give a fuck.
[02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:10.140]  And then she'd stare at you and then look at the pile of options you had, really curious as to
[02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:14.780]  what you might pick, totally oblivious that you took this a little more seriously than she did,
[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:21.260]  or you're not interested in finding out how strong she made them this week at 11 AM. And
[02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:24.540]  15 minutes after you ate the first one, she'd ask you what the next one was going to be.
[02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:25.100]  Yeah.
[02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:27.740]  And there are some days where I don't know how we made it through clothes.
[02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:30.460]  There were some times that the numbers were a little bit off.
[02:16:31.900 --> 02:16:34.460]  There were some days I wasn't sure people were keeping numbers.
[02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:37.900]  Yeah. I'm pretty sure there were some eight gram quarters going out the door sometimes.
[02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:43.100]  Like there was a window that we had to stay with in between. And we just kind of kept it from going
[02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:44.780]  too far outside of that little box.
[02:16:44.780 --> 02:16:46.940]  Shout out to Karen and her homemade edibles that used to fucking wreck my shit.
[02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:49.420]  I still dream about that banana bread.
[02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:53.100]  Josh and I fell down the stairs, like fucking rolled down the dance.
[02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:54.220]  It was a switch back down the stairs.
[02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:55.820]  It was a switch back down the stairs.
[02:16:55.820 --> 02:16:57.100]  And they would tumble down it.
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:57.820]  Down.
[02:16:57.820 --> 02:16:59.180]  Laughing like ladies.
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:03.580]  I remember walking up three flights of stairs in ridiculous heat, because it got really hot
[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:07.900]  in that building. And I'd get to the third floor knowing that that was where I needed to go and
[02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:13.500]  have no idea why I was there. And I'd get halfway back downstairs before I remembered whatever it
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:14.380]  was I went up for.
[02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:20.700]  That place was fun. Speaking of edibles, I'm pretty sure I mentioned eating a 1000 milligram,
[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:21.820]  Josh, excuse me for that, a 1000 milligram edibles.
[02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:23.580]  Don't try that at home, folks.
[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:27.340]  Because I don't recommend it. Don't eat a 1000 milligram edible unless you want to be
[02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:31.820]  fucked up for a day and a half. If you're not me, probably three days. I think like a civilian,
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:36.220]  if you gave that to like, right, I'm not anybody else that we know that doesn't smoke.
[02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:39.260]  Also, an article at home entitled, I drank the weed lube.
[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:41.020]  Laughing
[02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:41.740]  For three days.
[02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:47.980]  The 100 milligram edible, if people get novices gobble that sucker up,
[02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:52.460]  six, eight hours is what people report. It's just you ate the 100 milligram.
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:54.060]  Jeff's talking about a 1000.
[02:17:54.060 --> 02:17:58.540]  Yeah. I ate a 1000 milligram edible. Honest, I haven't been, I've been gun shy, bro. I haven't
[02:17:58.540 --> 02:18:00.460]  eaten an edible since then. I've been a little bit scared.
[02:18:00.460 --> 02:18:04.860]  It happens. I did it to myself the other day and it wasn't even with a really big dose.
[02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:09.020]  I just, I popped a couple. I thought I'd be comfortable with it. We got to the movie
[02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:13.660]  theater. I looked up and was just blown the fuck away. There were so many food choices.
[02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:17.020]  And before I could figure out what I wanted, I heard my wife giggling next to me.
[02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:21.820]  She's not a smoker, but she knows when I look up and I'm just too big to pick from the menu.
[02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:28.380]  And I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. So it happens to the pros too. But yeah.
[02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:34.940]  That 1000 milligrams was rough on my system. It, it, it fucked me up. My whole body felt weird
[02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:35.900]  for a day and a half.
[02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:39.100]  People assume that that's like the comfortable intro to,
[02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:43.420]  to marijuana consumption. And it's not like smoking's the, the time tested reason.
[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:47.100]  Yeah. Smoke some flowers through a pipe, smoke some flowers through a bong or a joint,
[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:52.300]  get used to that. Take a dab one day. Take like three dabs in one day and then start taking
[02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:55.020]  big dabs and then dab every day. And then eat some edibles.
[02:18:55.580 --> 02:18:57.180]  Progress slow. It gets expensive.
[02:18:57.180 --> 02:18:58.940]  Yeah. Well, yeah.
[02:18:58.940 --> 02:18:59.740]  Rig junkie.
[02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:01.980]  I like a good rig.
[02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:07.420]  As long as you can, you can, you can look people in the eye and say, I don't eject what I'm
[02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:11.820]  addicted to. I just buy glass. It's not the same.
[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:13.180]  Different kind of glass.
[02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:17.420]  Just rig after rig after rig. It's such a beautiful thing.
[02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:22.140]  Shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass, 517 South Dahout. If you need a rig,
[02:19:22.300 --> 02:19:26.060]  you really need to legalize it in your area. We really can't stress the benefits enough.
[02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:28.540]  Make your table look like mine. Just glass rigs everywhere. You just want,
[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:29.740]  you want to hear this kind of shit at your house.
[02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:30.940]  Shout out to Oil Slick.
[02:19:30.940 --> 02:19:34.060]  Just want to hear glass rigs tinkering on each other all over the place.
[02:19:34.060 --> 02:19:35.900]  At Oil Slick, it's a shout out.
[02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:38.620]  Hey, it's 85% of this table cover.
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:40.620]  Mike's giving shout outs. It's time to wrap up the show. Yes,
[02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:41.740]  the table is covered in oil slick pants.
[02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:44.380]  Careful, about to give away something again. You better wrap it up fast.
[02:19:44.380 --> 02:19:45.180]  We can't do that.
[02:19:45.180 --> 02:19:46.620]  Who wants this old shoe?
[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:51.820]  That's really ironic. There's another story that matches up with what you just said that
[02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:54.060]  I stepped in dog shit today.
[02:19:54.940 --> 02:19:58.540]  The first time in a really long time that I've stepped in dog shit. I've stepped in some shit
[02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:03.580]  today. All right, ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening to the podcast. Mike, thanks for
[02:20:03.580 --> 02:20:07.100]  coming and hanging out. Mike's wife, thanks for letting Mike come and hang out. He did an hour
[02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:11.340]  and 15 minutes. The phone has beeped a couple of times. You can reach over and check it out and see
[02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:14.460]  who it is. Now I'll turn off your mic and I'll talk for a couple of seconds here by myself.
[02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:16.460]  Have a good night people. Hope you enjoyed the show.
[02:20:16.460 --> 02:20:20.060]  Make sure you guys check out Mike's Facebook group. Make sure you follow Mike on
[02:20:20.700 --> 02:20:25.100]  to wind or I almost said Tinder. Make sure you follow Mike on Tinder. No, don't do it on Tinder.
[02:20:25.100 --> 02:20:28.860]  You'll get him in trouble. Mike's a married man with a new baby. He is not on Tinder.
[02:20:28.860 --> 02:20:32.860]  Don't do that. Good luck on Tinder, whatever you're doing out there. Guys, make sure you go

[02:20:57.980 --> 02:21:03.100]  everywhere, bro. Do you get to be a dude? I was laughing over there. We were spot on and now
[02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:07.740]  you're stumbling over like catchphrases. It's cute. The program shit starts making it hard.

[02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:47.900]  I posted a picture of a butterfly just to get a little bit of variety on my page,
[02:21:47.900 --> 02:21:53.340]  but I usually post a whole bunch of good cannabis photography, big bud shots, big room shots,

[02:22:17.100 --> 02:22:23.180]  and we'll review it thoroughly on the show. Well, I had to go with words. There needed to be
[02:22:23.180 --> 02:22:26.140]  descriptive words in there quickly off the top of my head. And those are the ones I had.
[02:22:26.140 --> 02:22:28.620]  Send us some for demo guys. It's been a minute. We need something to pick apart.
[02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:32.300]  That's the truth. We'll play with your toys. God damn it. This got dirty quickly.

[02:22:49.580 --> 02:22:52.300]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for it.
[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:25.510]  Well, I used to get A's until I blazed in my grade slap. Went to college and acknowledged
[02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:30.070]  that I hated that route. So I backed out and I doubt I'll ever make it back. I see the way you
[02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:35.510]  act. Cut the jealous crap. Something's fishy here. I think I smell a rat. This is our house,
[02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:40.880]  but we ain't gotta tell him that. Let's leave him at the front door yelling at everybody.
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:45.840]  Get another dab pat. Same mood team, slightly different from the last track. A million songs
[02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:50.480]  about me, but where the dabs at? You don't like my dabbing songs? You can kiss my ass crack.
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:56.080]  Come on, everybody. Drop another huge bomb. 420 game, 710. It's time to move on. Upgrade your
[02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:01.040]  tolerance. Downside your new bomb. Favorite way to medicate. I don't think it's too strong.
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:05.360]  All my fans, I'ma make them bounce. Like my checks from my bank account. When I write and
[02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:10.240]  fake them out. I love the paper stacks, but I hate the count. Lumberjack, one and a half,
[02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:18.600]  two and eight. These people suck like a bag purge. The hash surgeon, working the dish,
[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:23.800]  then teaching the plans to man so he learns how to fish. Oil up the butter pan. Linus is the
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:29.720]  brother man. Number one producer, so I don't need another fan. But y'all don't understand anyway.
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:35.960]  Gap about money while we rubber band every day. And when I say hit the trees, I mean up by the
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:41.400]  honey hive, chilling with the bees. Fuck sticks and seeds. I want all different breeds and
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:47.160]  consistencies to go. Come on, everybody. Get another dab pack. Same routine, slightly different
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:51.800]  from the last track. A million songs about we, but where the dabs at? You don't like my dabbing
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:57.080]  songs? You can kiss my ass crack. Come on, everybody. Drop another huge bomb. 420 game,
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:02.680]  710. It's time to move on. Upgrade your tolerance. Downside your new bomb. Favorite way to medicate.
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:38.190]  I don't think it's too strong. Yeah, welcome back. Cannabis community. It's time for episode
[02:25:38.190 --> 02:25:43.150]  number 143 of the girl from your heart podcast. Your source for cannabis news, education and
[02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:47.630]  conversation. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, you're a new smoker or a
[02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:51.630]  dedicated dabber. If you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[02:25:51.630 --> 02:25:57.070]  current state of cannabis, this, my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host. My friends
[02:25:57.070 --> 02:26:01.230]  call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always. I need to send a huge
[02:26:01.230 --> 02:26:04.750]  thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band for letting me use their music on my
[02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:12.670]  podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Coop and the entire mystic roots crew. I hope everybody had a great
[02:26:12.670 --> 02:26:17.630]  710. I hope everybody enjoyed the Sunday episode. You guys on this episode I am joined by Jesse
[02:26:17.630 --> 02:26:23.150]  grows from the Colorado podcast. We talk a whole bunch about outdoor growing. We talk a whole bunch
[02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:28.030]  of random stuff. The episode was an hour and 20 minutes long. So I'm not going to waste too much
[02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:31.470]  time here at the start of the show. I'm going to let the music play and in just a second, I'll be
[02:26:31.470 --> 02:26:40.340]  right back with Jesse grows. Hang out with us. Wait, say that again. Is that a real thing? Gunpowder
[02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:46.180]  turps gunpowder turps. What does that mean? Uh, government meal smells like burnt fireworks.
[02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:50.100]  Ah, that's what you meant by that. Okay. I was, I was kind of confused by that statement. I was
[02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:54.420]  like gunpowder. I'm missing out on some shit. What's happening now. Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:57.940]  welcome back to the podcast. I said, I'd be right back with our friend Jesse and guess what?
[02:26:57.940 --> 02:27:01.940]  There he is. Welcome to the show, brother. Thank you, man. Let's tell everybody about
[02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:05.460]  your social media so that they can stalk you while they're listening. Where can they find you online?
[02:27:06.980 --> 02:27:15.060]  Instagram, Jesse grows at Jesse grows, whatever. At Jesse grows on Instagram. So I post a couple
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:20.260]  pics a week. They're glorious cannabis photography for the most part, or just crap. I find interesting.
[02:27:21.540 --> 02:27:24.260]  I think those are very similar things. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:32.340]  Yeah. Do you have a website? Yeah, we've got a, I do Colorado podcast. Uh, we are now on stitcher.
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:38.980]  We're also on soundcloud and we're also on our own website at Colorado podcast.com. Make sure
[02:27:38.980 --> 02:27:44.820]  you guys support the Colorado podcast and my friends, Jesse, uh, despicable D and our boy 44.
[02:27:45.380 --> 02:27:54.180]  Shout out to all those guys. It's, um, it's a podcast. It's very podcast. It's, um,
[02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:59.220]  loosely cannabis based. We get around to talking about weed every now and then, but,
[02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:06.740]  uh, wacky and wild adventures for the most part. Yes. Yes. Um, it's, it's the bullet of podcast.
[02:28:10.660 --> 02:28:14.180]  If your podcast had a haircut, it would certainly have your mic may jump out of
[02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:18.980]  that little clip. If you have it like that, you're cool. There you go. Cool. Cool. Welcome
[02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:22.180]  to the show, bro. Thanks for joining us. Make sure you guys support his podcast. You guys.
[02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:26.420]  So Jesse is kind of an outdoor grow expert. He's been on the show several times. If you've listened,
[02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:30.180]  uh, he knows a lot about outdoor growing. I know a lot about indoor growing.
[02:28:30.820 --> 02:28:36.980]  So we had some outdoor questions. Um, Jesse wants to talk a little bit about the differences in,
[02:28:36.980 --> 02:28:42.980]  uh, small like basement cultivation compared to large commercial growth. So we'll get into that
[02:28:43.060 --> 02:28:48.260]  also, but let's talk about an email that I got. Uh, I got an email from a listener. I don't have
[02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:51.540]  the email on my phone right now. I just set the phone aside today. A shout out to the guy that
[02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:56.980]  sent me an email. He asked when he's growing outdoors, how big of a hole does he want to dig
[02:28:56.980 --> 02:29:02.180]  to put his plant? I told him through an email, I told him to listen to the show and I'd have Jesse
[02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:07.140]  on for more info, but I told him basically make the hole as big as you can. What else can you
[02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:13.460]  tell us about that? Jesse? Um, I personally, over the years I've noticed a plant's
[02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:18.340]  somewhat limited, especially when it's in the ground by the size of its container.
[02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:29.700]  Your hole has a pre-mixed soil in it. Uh, the shoulders of the plants aren't going to go too
[02:29:29.700 --> 02:29:41.560]  far past the edge of that hole. Um, I started off with two by two holes and worked to probably keep
[02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:46.440]  going someday five by five. When you're doing these four by four holes, you're doing a four
[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:53.480]  by four square, right? Four feet wide, four feet long. How deep are you going? Um, 18 inches. I
[02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:57.720]  used to go deeper. Um, I've learned a little bit more about the roots to the cannabis.
[02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:03.000]  Am I right in thinking that cannabis wants to root outward instead of downward?
[02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:07.160]  For the most part. Okay. I mean, it does like to go down, especially if you're going from seed
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:30.660]  plants. Oh yeah. They'll go, they'll go hard. Extraordinary. Um, but for the most part,
[02:30:30.660 --> 02:30:36.580]  that is a lot of damn dirt. You know how many cubic feet that is? Um, well, we would have to
[02:30:36.580 --> 02:30:42.820]  do the math on the size of the hole that you just said, right? Five, maybe I want to say six.
[02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:48.260]  No, it's gotta be more than that. Cause one of those Fox farm bags is 1.75 cubic feet.
[02:30:48.260 --> 02:30:58.870]  How many of those bags do you think it would take? This is how growers think in math, you guys.
[02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:04.310]  That's probably supposed to take you. I think it'd take three cubic feet.
[02:31:04.310 --> 02:31:08.710]  All right. That's a lot of soil. That's a lot of root space. How big are these plants that,
[02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:11.270]  in your example, how big are your plants at the end of the season?
[02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:17.750]  Four or five foot around. I mean, all the way around, um, you know, not just through one spot.
[02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:23.750]  So you can't hug your plants. You can't get your arms around them and hug them?
[02:31:24.470 --> 02:31:31.430]  Okay. Um, they, uh, I kind of limit my plants. They can only get about six foot tall. Uh, if that,
[02:31:32.470 --> 02:31:37.750]  if I was able to let them get bigger, they'd probably end up eight, nine foot tall.
[02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:41.910]  Okay. So you limited my privacy? Yes. That's a such a bitch. Yes.
[02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:45.590]  Man. Cause you do such a great outdoor to limit you as a bitch.
[02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:50.790]  Um, I used to fight it real hard to keep them down. I have learned a new trick. Just plant later.
[02:31:50.790 --> 02:31:55.190]  Plant later, huh? Is that the new trick? Yeah. Super high tech. Yeah. Yeah. You don't have to
[02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:59.510]  bend them as much. You don't have to top as much. Just take them out later. Hashtag lazy tech.
[02:31:59.510 --> 02:32:05.430]  Lazy tech. So, uh, when, when are we, are we in the flowering phase officially yet,
[02:32:05.430 --> 02:32:10.790]  or do we still have a few days to go? Um, I, I feel like we've still got a week or so to go.
[02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:14.790]  Okay. So in about a week here in Colorado, and we were doing research before the show
[02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:20.790]  from coast to coast, there's only about a half hour in a sunlight photo period and natural photo
[02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:24.630]  period right now we're talking about it. Uh, Jesse was doing the research.
[02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:29.430]  And, and difference between, uh, what I was finding, it was like, uh, New York,
[02:32:29.430 --> 02:32:35.270]  the sun was coming up at 5 39 in the morning and in Los Angeles, it was coming up at like
[02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:45.430]  eight or some shit. So that's odd. Um, but yeah, so, but, uh, photo period,
[02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:53.350]  you know, it's, it's gonna start, um, really shrinking from here on out. And, you know,
[02:32:53.350 --> 02:32:57.910]  first you're gonna get your Indica varieties into flower and then your more Sativa varieties will
[02:32:57.910 --> 02:33:01.670]  follow along behind that. Yeah. Your flow and blueberry, those are really going to start
[02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:06.550]  taking off right. So yeah, everyone in Colorado that grows flow, that bitch is going to go into
[02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:11.590]  flower real hard here in about a week, 10 days, she'll be spitting out calyxes real soon for you.
[02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:16.150]  You'll love it. You'll see pistols in like 20 days. I bet. Yeah. Oh yeah. All right. Uh,
[02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:21.190]  plant later. It's just such a ridiculous solution for easy shit. Yeah. All right.
[02:33:21.190 --> 02:33:29.030]  That's been my, uh, my goal lately is just K I S S keep it simple stoner. Yeah. So the size of
[02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:31.830]  your plant, sorry. I keep clearing the throat guys. We're taking some dabs. Let's talk about
[02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:39.670]  these dabs for a brief second. I was dunking my dabber into 90% THC. This is 91% THC. It's
[02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:45.510]  a distillate from our friends at Evo lab. And then I take the 90% distillate that's on my dabber.
[02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:52.390]  And I dunk that into pure terpenoids of ghost train haze also made by our friends at Evo labs.
[02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:56.790]  This is amazing. You guys, this is one of the best highs you can get. The first couple of times I
[02:33:56.790 --> 02:34:02.790]  smoked this, I got stupid high. Uh, I was just goofy. I tried to go back to work and I pretty
[02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:06.710]  much just ended up doing stuff on the computer for the next hour. Cause it's like, yeah, metric
[02:34:06.710 --> 02:34:11.910]  needs to be updated somehow because I got to sit down on a chair for a minute, but a shout out to
[02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:15.110]  the dabs. That's why my throat's a little bit clogged. I do apologize for being so congested
[02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:20.390]  today. Yeah. That, uh, those OG kush tabs were heavenly. Yeah. That's delicious. Isn't it though?
[02:34:20.390 --> 02:34:25.670]  I've got OG ghost train, our ghost train, Hayes turps and OG kush turps. And then a couple of
[02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:31.670]  nights ago I took some of this, a 120 micron blue sherb, a fresh frozen solventless hash.
[02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:36.390]  And I rolled out a little piece into a taco shell and I put some, what did I have? It was
[02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:41.510]  a cactus cooler, a live resin on top of that. I smeared that on like taco sauce. And then I took
[02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:45.590]  a piece of Durban poison, Durban poison shatter and rolled it into a little snake and put that
[02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:52.150]  in the middle, like some taco meat. And then I put a, I dunked the dabber into the 90% THC
[02:34:52.150 --> 02:34:56.630]  distillate and had that on the dabber. And then I picked up the taco with the dabber and dunked
[02:34:56.630 --> 02:35:04.630]  that into the ghost train Hayes turps. And, uh, I was blast off. I was rocket high. Yeah.
[02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:07.590]  You should have put a little THC in there somewhere.
[02:35:09.030 --> 02:35:14.310]  My arm hair was wiggling. I was like, Ooh, I was making funny faces and funny noises. I was
[02:35:14.310 --> 02:35:23.030]  really high for a little while. My first turp dab, um, by arms and legs went, um, very pleasantly
[02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:28.070]  numb, like almost immediately. Yeah. There's something about smoking just raw turps. Yeah.
[02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:34.950]  It's I immediately, I was like, damn, there's, this is medicine there for someone somewhere.
[02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:40.390]  For me, it's great recreation, but for someone somewhere that's, that's something.
[02:35:40.390 --> 02:35:44.710]  I, I like to take just the normal shatter. I've got, I've got this Durban poison mob boss shatter.
[02:35:44.710 --> 02:35:48.230]  And I just take little chunks of that and dunk that into the OG cush stabs. And it makes it
[02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:53.030]  taste so amazing. That's when I haven't heard of in a while. Yeah. Right. It's been a while
[02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:57.190]  when this is gone. I don't know if I'm going to be able to properly get high anymore because I've
[02:35:57.190 --> 02:36:02.230]  been smoking this distillate and these turps so heavily that my tolerance game has upped itself.
[02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:05.590]  When I go smoke with other people, they're just like, dude, what the fuck is wrong with you? And
[02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:10.150]  I'm like, don't you want more dabs? And they're in the corner, like, come on, let's party.
[02:36:10.390 --> 02:36:17.750]  Um, one more quick question on that. Do you think the turps, I mean, I think I already know the
[02:36:17.750 --> 02:36:24.150]  answer to this, but I'll just ask, do the turps complete, um, if you dip it in just like a normal
[02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:28.950]  shatter, do the turps complete something there or, or make it more powerful in your opinion?
[02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:33.910]  It pushes it. Yeah. It pushes the high a little bit higher. It certainly pushes the high up.
[02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:40.870]  I think the, my theory, it's probably not such a theory, but the turpenoids work along with the
[02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:47.910]  cannabinoids just like the, uh, uh, the entourage effect. Absolutely. Absolutely. Because the
[02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:54.870]  turpenoids that we're using guys that looks just like, it looks like pee. It's just little drops
[02:36:54.870 --> 02:37:01.990]  of gold in a vial. It's got the consistency of like a really high grade, um, like a machine oil
[02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:05.590]  or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to say really runny olive oil, a little, little
[02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:09.750]  runnier than olive oil maybe. And you just dunk the dab right into it is what I've been doing.
[02:37:09.750 --> 02:37:14.310]  I put in, been putting a dab on the dabber and just dunk it. And I did, I don't get too hard.
[02:37:14.310 --> 02:37:18.550]  One time I just dunked it in there and gave it a little swizzle. And when it hit the nail, I heard
[02:37:18.550 --> 02:37:26.790]  that the turps like sizzled and I had turp face. Like my mouth just tasted like ghost train Hayes
[02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:31.590]  forever. But it was almost unpleasant. It was like, I OD'd my face on turps, but then I was
[02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:37.430]  rocket high. Um, that's something else. And it kind of, you can almost wash away the flavor
[02:37:37.430 --> 02:37:41.990]  with, with too much. Like it's so overwhelming. You don't even get anything. You just burn. Yeah.
[02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:45.910]  You, you maximum overload your mouth. And it's like, I can't taste anything. Cause you just
[02:37:45.910 --> 02:37:50.070]  ruined my palate. Yep. It's like, we need something too spicy for the next hour. Everything
[02:37:50.070 --> 02:37:54.790]  just tastes spicy. All right. So to our friend that sent us an email about digging holes,
[02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:59.030]  uh, the bigger, the hole, the bigger, the plant Jesse recommends about a three by three,
[02:37:59.030 --> 02:38:03.750]  a four by four, about 18 inches deep. Fill it with the best soil that you can afford. Put some
[02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:08.390]  amendments in there. Um, let's give them a list of five good amendments to throw in there. Worm
[02:38:08.390 --> 02:38:14.630]  castings, oyster shell, alfalfa, kelp mill, kelp meal, name, seed meal, name, seed meal,
[02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:19.830]  and Karanja seed meal. That's six. I'm going to throw in crab, crab shell or oyster or shrimp
[02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:24.550]  shell mill in there. Okay. All right. Pretty much set there. There we go. You guys, I hope you wrote
[02:38:24.550 --> 02:38:28.630]  that down. If not hit that little 15 second back button twice and you'll get it again. Write it
[02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:33.590]  down. Put that stuff in that big hole with your soil. Maybe put some perlite in there. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:41.910]  For a rice holes. Um, yeah. All right. That's the one. There you go. Pumice. There you go.
[02:38:41.910 --> 02:38:45.830]  Lava rock. Lava rock. Yeah. Some, some sort of drainage. You want to get some oxygen in there,
[02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:50.870]  but you don't want to take up too much root space with a bunch of rock and perlite. So figure out
[02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:57.590]  your mix. Yeah. Outdoor soil doesn't need to be as airy as indoor soil, especially in the ground.
[02:38:57.590 --> 02:39:06.310]  So you can do yourself a great disservice, um, by putting too much perlite in there. It's just,
[02:39:06.310 --> 02:39:11.030]  it's going to increase the frequency of happening to water. Okay. So let's see. That's why you're
[02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:15.590]  the outdoor pro and I'm the indoor guy. All right. Um, big shout out to my friend that sent me the
[02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:19.350]  email. Keep the emails coming. If you have any more followup questions, let me know. We'll get
[02:39:19.350 --> 02:39:24.630]  them on the show for you and mulch that soil up. Keep it mulched. There you go. It makes a huge,
[02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:30.150]  huge difference at the end of the season, man. It's totally, totally worth it. We're going to
[02:39:30.150 --> 02:39:34.710]  have to talk about a bunch of stuff for outdoor season. I've got questions this year. Nice. All
[02:39:34.710 --> 02:39:40.390]  right. So our friend, Fred, Fred Garvin, he keeps the messages coming. Um, listens to the Colorado
[02:39:40.390 --> 02:39:43.830]  podcast. Nice. Shut up. That's cool. He listens to both of our shows. We're going to have to do
[02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:48.470]  more of the swap casts. Yeah, those are fun. We'll duct tape Adam next time. Uh, shout out to Adam.
[02:39:48.470 --> 02:39:51.830]  What's up 44. I love you, bro. I also love picking on you. Hope you're doing well. Uh,
[02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:57.270]  so Fred sent us a message while back. He was making seeded plants. He had, uh, pollen. He
[02:39:57.270 --> 02:40:01.270]  put pollen on female plants. Those plants have now been pollinated. They're forming seeds.
[02:40:01.270 --> 02:40:07.270]  He put them outdoors. Um, he had many questions about putting, putting them outdoors, about
[02:40:07.270 --> 02:40:13.750]  acclimating them to the outdoor area and how to get this timer, right? Once I messaged Jesse
[02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:18.950]  about this, Jesse had a great idea. Jesse said that once you, once those plants are pollinated,
[02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:24.070]  if you go put them outside and the light cycles a little bit off, they're not going to harm
[02:40:24.070 --> 02:40:29.590]  because they're already pollinated. They've pretty much passed there. I guess if they were humans,
[02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:33.510]  now they would be in menopause if they were females and now they can't, they're past that
[02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:37.510]  cycle. Their whole sexual reproductive thing is done. They've already decided they're making
[02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:44.310]  seeds. They have a manifest destiny to complete. Yes. And if a girl's pregnant, you can't already
[02:40:44.310 --> 02:40:48.710]  get her pregnant. You can't really like, so that that's those plants that we told Fred to put
[02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:52.390]  outside should be a hundred percent legit. He also mentioned in one of his emails that his
[02:40:52.390 --> 02:40:57.270]  outdoor plants were in full flower. So he's totally going to be okay. Yeah, totally fine there.
[02:40:57.270 --> 02:41:01.190]  So shout out to Fred for sending me messages, dude. I appreciate it. I hope you've got at least
[02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:05.910]  an iRegenetic sticker or something. Uh, send me a message, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:41:06.390 --> 02:41:09.910]  Tell me that it's you because I know that that's not your real name, bro. Come on. I know better
[02:41:09.910 --> 02:41:13.430]  than that. Send me an email and we'll get you some more stickers or something if you want it.
[02:41:13.430 --> 02:41:20.710]  We love all of your input. I might have to clear that one out. I might have to edit that throat
[02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:28.630]  clear out. That was ridiculous. I got a friend on Facebook that, her or his name, I'm pretty sure
[02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:35.990]  it's a her though, um, is the last name. First and last name is last name's a movie star. And I,
[02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:40.070]  I called her out on it one time in a private message. I was like, I know your name's fake.
[02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:44.790]  How'd you figure that out? And I was like, well, duh. I was like, so-and-so, so-and-so,
[02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:48.630]  and so-and-so, so-and-so. Oh, wow. You're clever. I'm like, no, I'm not.
[02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:56.630]  Slipping on your secret tech. Nobody is who they say they are on Facebook, but I use my real name.
[02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:59.670]  I like it. I like it. You can't, you gotta, then you think about what you're posting. You can't
[02:41:59.670 --> 02:42:03.750]  spend time trolling people if you got your name and face up there. All right. So Fred put his
[02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:08.390]  plants outdoor, outdoors. They're not going to hermaphrodite on him. I do not believe so.
[02:42:08.390 --> 02:42:12.070]  He's going to have viable seeds if he waits long enough. Yep. Yep. I think he was,
[02:42:12.070 --> 02:42:15.670]  he actually pulled some of those seeds. I think, I think he's got some of those seeds.
[02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:20.790]  A lot of them were white, but plenty of them were viable and tiger stripes. So good work, bro.
[02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:25.110]  Do you know what the cross was? I can't. I really don't remember. I don't remember. Honestly,
[02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:30.310]  I read so many emails and read so many crosses that a lot of that shit. I've got a lot of the
[02:42:30.310 --> 02:42:33.750]  crosses in the green and healthy wellness garden. I can't remember what they are off the top of my
[02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:37.510]  head. I'm the same way. Yeah. I learned a few, you know what I mean? As I go, I'm like, that one's
[02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:42.070]  this one. I remember that now. And I just absorbed those slowly. All right. So he's got his plants
[02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:47.430]  outdoors. They've got seeds in them. And since then, his shit got attacked by spider mites.
[02:42:47.430 --> 02:42:51.510]  Oh no. And he asked is, I don't have his email in front of me, but basically he said, none of
[02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:55.750]  this plant material is going to be consumed or smoked by people since it's all just seeded.
[02:42:56.630 --> 02:43:00.470]  How nuclear can I go to spray the fuck out of it for these spider mites?
[02:43:04.630 --> 02:43:08.630]  My opinion would be as nuclear as he is comfortable with. That's what I told him.
[02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:14.870]  Exactly what I told him. I told him, keep in mind his health while he's applying pesticides and keep
[02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:18.390]  in mind the health of the rest of his garden, because I know he's got other cannabis plants
[02:43:18.470 --> 02:43:23.510]  out there and the insects in that garden. Absolutely. The biodiversity of that area.
[02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:29.670]  Yeah. Be, be aware of that. Oh, don't kill the bees. That's super important. If the bees go away,
[02:43:29.670 --> 02:43:33.190]  everything goes away. We don't have food. If we don't have bees. I saw my dad's neighbor
[02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:37.430]  spraying round up in his yard the other day. I went and chased that fucker down. I was like,
[02:43:37.430 --> 02:43:43.190]  no, I was like, see those three white boxes over there. And instantly he was like, Oh man,
[02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:47.590]  I'm so sorry. We got them set up with some Epsom salt and vinegar.
[02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:52.070]  There you go. Go organic. Yeah. That'll get rid of almost any insect that you don't want around.
[02:43:53.350 --> 02:43:56.550]  Several, several tablespoons of Epsom salt per gallon.
[02:43:56.550 --> 02:44:02.390]  Can I ask you about how to get rid of fucking grasshoppers right now in a ganja garden outdoors?
[02:44:02.390 --> 02:44:07.430]  Yeah. That is a very popular question lately. Yeah. They're super heavy everywhere this year.
[02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:18.150]  Um, my wife, Bernadette, my wife, my beautiful wife, um, she has a list of pesticides. I cannot
[02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:25.430]  require or recall any of them. Um, and none of them knowing the way they work and how grasshoppers
[02:44:25.430 --> 02:44:31.190]  work, I felt really were necessary. I didn't, I didn't feel like you may kill one or two
[02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:36.950]  grasshoppers with it, or you may discourage one or two, but it's so my big thing, um,
[02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:42.470]  mow the weeds around your area. That's one of the biggest ones that take away their food supply.
[02:44:42.470 --> 02:44:49.430]  Okay. Um, molasses traps, which is, um, a Mason jar that is a quarter of the way filled with
[02:44:49.430 --> 02:44:56.630]  water, a quarter of the way filled with molasses buried to the rim, um, around the plants. I know
[02:44:56.630 --> 02:45:02.710]  it's kind of arcade or, you know, really simple here, but yeah, it's, they fall in it and they
[02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:07.990]  can't get out. All right. So that makes total sense. Um, try to attract blue Jays and Robins
[02:45:07.990 --> 02:45:14.470]  to your area. Um, Robins, I don't know how to attract blue Jays. I know really like peanuts.
[02:45:14.470 --> 02:45:19.270]  So there you go. What else is going to show up if we throw out peanuts? Um,
[02:45:20.070 --> 02:45:25.510]  is that going to bring rabbits? I suppose so possibly. Okay. So my first idea, I told my
[02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:29.590]  friend to put a chicken in his yard to get rid of his grasshopper. Is that going to bring me more
[02:45:29.590 --> 02:45:35.830]  problems? Um, in the beginning stages, chickens love grasshoppers. They also love juvenile
[02:45:35.830 --> 02:45:41.190]  marijuana plants. Okay. Once you've got a four or five foot tall bush, uh, the chicken is going to
[02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:46.550]  use it as shade and it really isn't going to notice it too much. It might pick at the understory a
[02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:50.710]  little bit, but okay. It might clean it up for you. Yeah. It might do some lollipopping.
[02:45:51.190 --> 02:46:03.350]  Hey Pedro, badges. Oh shit. Oh shit. I got a whole bunch of undocumented chickens
[02:46:03.350 --> 02:46:08.630]  running this fucking ganja farm. They're fucking doing pest management and lollipopping plants for
[02:46:08.630 --> 02:46:15.750]  us. We're geniuses over here. Let's train some chickens, bro. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, four Cox tree
[02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:25.190]  service. Sorry guys, this got weird. Uh, blame it on the Terps hashtag blame it on the Terps.
[02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:30.230]  There we go. There we go. It's new. Uh, yeah. Shout out to the Terps. One other comment on,
[02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:36.630]  uh, grasshoppers. I'm hippie dippy when it comes to growing outdoors. Uh, as soon as I hear about
[02:46:36.630 --> 02:46:43.670]  a grasshopper problem, I feel like something's out of balance. So instead of killing the grasshopper,
[02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:49.510]  you might want to look at the bigger picture and see if something's missing there or if you're
[02:46:49.510 --> 02:46:54.470]  doing something wrong or so. I'm going to say that's like 75% of the time. That is the case.
[02:46:55.030 --> 02:46:59.270]  It really, I feel like this applies to smaller girls, like those guys out on Siloam road where
[02:46:59.270 --> 02:47:05.510]  they've got four acres planted in the ground. Um, I mean, that's a completely different scenario.
[02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:10.230]  They're going to have those issues regardless. That is a lot of damn cannabis. Yeah. I went
[02:47:10.230 --> 02:47:16.070]  out and drove and looked at it today, dude. It's fucking huge. Silent road. I like a near Bula.
[02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:19.910]  Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm going to take a drive out there. It's called the green mile for a reason.
[02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:23.910]  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. They're doing huge things. Everyone talks shit about Pueblo, Colorado, but
[02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:29.830]  everywhere around us is greenhouses and outdoor grows and just acres and acres of hemp and acres
[02:47:29.830 --> 02:47:36.230]  and acres of cannabis. It's just everywhere. It's so rad right now. Drive out there. Uh, 50 and 96.
[02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:42.150]  We need more, more, um, I don't know that there's a technical term for these restaurants.
[02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:46.950]  Uh, fast casual, I think more fast casual restaurants because that's what the grow
[02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:50.630]  industry and people like us, that's what we crave. We don't want the Taco Bell, the Dr. Pepper.
[02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:54.870]  I hated going here earlier. What you got there. Is that Sonic? Yeah. Yeah. That kind of stuff.
[02:47:54.870 --> 02:47:59.590]  It's it's D I don't, I, there's nothing at Sonic for me. Yeah. Honestly, there's nothing there.
[02:47:59.590 --> 02:48:02.950]  McDonald's offers nothing for me. Don't eat at many fast food places.
[02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:10.070]  I get, uh, sometimes Jimmy John's if that's even, you know, a Qdoba and Chipotle because you can get
[02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:13.830]  a veggie burrito there. That's pretty much the options. The beans at both those places tastes
[02:48:13.830 --> 02:48:19.670]  like hell. So you just got to deal with it. See even vegetarians. Well, of course, vegetarians
[02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:24.070]  know what's up with a good batch of beans. I made a Facebook post the other day about,
[02:48:24.070 --> 02:48:28.310]  sorry, that microphone stands a little funny, bro. That sucks. It's cool. Um,
[02:48:28.310 --> 02:48:32.710]  about if you know the smell of good, or if you can tell good beans based on smell alone.
[02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:37.350]  Yeah. Yeah. They got to have that rich earthy smell to them and not too salty.
[02:48:38.710 --> 02:48:44.230]  All right. But we need more like a, like a Panera and like, I don't know, just more of that style.
[02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:49.110]  We don't even have a Qdoba here. Just something like that. Little delis and shit like that.
[02:48:49.110 --> 02:48:55.270]  A witch, which Tokyo Joe's we can go for that kind of shit. Which, which is, yeah, that's the stuff.
[02:48:55.270 --> 02:48:58.710]  Yeah. All kinds of free advertising for a bunch of shitty restaurants.
[02:48:59.270 --> 02:49:05.670]  To a tomato Joe's in Pueblo on, I think that's main street.
[02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:07.830]  Can I eat there? It sounds like a place I could eat.
[02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:12.470]  They do have a veggie sandwich for sure. Yeah. It's just a,
[02:49:13.030 --> 02:49:15.910]  Oh, your mic is totally getting away from you. Here we go. I got it.
[02:49:15.910 --> 02:49:19.430]  You just going to rock star. Yeah. Is that how you do it on the Colorado podcast?
[02:49:19.430 --> 02:49:23.110]  We don't have stance. Okay. I apologize for the thing going limp on you.
[02:49:23.110 --> 02:49:27.110]  Yeah. They got a couple of veggie sandwiches. Just a little mom and pop on the wall.
[02:49:27.830 --> 02:49:31.270]  Okay. That's right by the library. Okay. I'm going to go eat there. Those are the best.
[02:49:31.270 --> 02:49:34.710]  All right. Let's put this train wreck back on, on, on some rails here.
[02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:39.350]  Let's talk about cannabis growing. This is not the Colorado podcast. We did not bring 44
[02:49:40.470 --> 02:49:43.430]  sandwiches. We couldn't bring 44. He's not allowed to go anywhere.
[02:49:43.990 --> 02:49:50.470]  This is the exclusion zone. When, when is that done? Who knows? Who knows? Poor dude. We missed
[02:49:50.470 --> 02:49:54.870]  you, bro. Can't wait to come out and play again. So Jesse wanted to talk about something that I
[02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:58.230]  find to be really important that people don't realize people want to jump into the cannabis
[02:49:58.230 --> 02:50:03.750]  industry. People move from all over the country to Colorado, to Washington, to California, to Oregon,
[02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:07.990]  to Michigan, to all these places that where cannabis growing is legal. And they show up here
[02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:11.910]  and they have either grown in their basement in an illegal state for a couple of years and had two or
[02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:15.750]  three lights, or they set up a small grow here in their garage or their basement. And they run four
[02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:20.870]  or six lights. And then they think I'm going to open a big ass grow. And then they're either going
[02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:25.030]  to do it legally or illegally. They're going to get permits or not. Or maybe they're just going to
[02:50:25.030 --> 02:50:28.230]  do this in an illegal place. They've been growing in their basement for a while. They're out there
[02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:31.430]  in the sticks in Nebraska. And then they're like, fuck it. We're going to buy that old meat plant.
[02:50:31.430 --> 02:50:34.950]  We're going to hang us up a hundred blocks and maybe they do it. You know what I mean? So
[02:50:35.910 --> 02:50:41.030]  the mistake that a lot of these people fuck up is they don't realize that going from the basement
[02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:46.390]  to a large grow facility, it's not just taking this much air conditioning and multiplying at
[02:50:46.390 --> 02:50:50.630]  times, however more many lights you're going to work. It doesn't work that way. You run into
[02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:56.630]  a whole new shit stew of problems when you start going to big scale growing. The humidity is
[02:50:56.630 --> 02:51:03.350]  ridiculously hard to control in a large room. Retardedly. Yeah. Ridiculously. You can say that
[02:51:03.350 --> 02:51:11.590]  word. Don't worry. It bugs me a little bit. Everyone's evolving. Well, yeah. It's hard as
[02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:16.230]  shit to remove a lot of humidity in a very large room. It's also hard to regulate the temperature
[02:51:16.230 --> 02:51:22.390]  flow and the CO2. So there's a lot of tricks to it. What's the biggest mistake you see people
[02:51:22.390 --> 02:51:27.750]  make when they go from when a dude goes and just builds this first big, when new people get their
[02:51:27.750 --> 02:51:31.830]  OPC license and they can build a grow, where do they fuck up? Air conditioning. Always air
[02:51:31.830 --> 02:51:35.430]  conditioning, right? Air conditioning. And humidity never even gets considered because
[02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:40.310]  they think this is the desert. I mean, it is the desert, but they think it's not going to be an
[02:51:40.310 --> 02:51:44.230]  issue because it's so dry here. Right. That's a bunch of BS. You're going to go pumping water
[02:51:44.230 --> 02:51:48.950]  into those plants every single day and they transpire. And there are a thousand watt lights,
[02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:53.510]  a bunch of them right above those plants. And the water wants to come out and go up toward those
[02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:57.830]  lights. And then it hangs out up by the ceiling and then it falls back down and then it hangs
[02:51:57.830 --> 02:52:01.830]  out and it gets between two leaves and it festers for a couple of days. And then you know what it
[02:52:01.830 --> 02:52:08.390]  does? It turns into fucking powdery mildew. Yep. So the spores are there. It just starts flowering.
[02:52:08.390 --> 02:52:12.870]  Yep. It's just waiting for you to give it the prime condition. Yeah. That whole grow room is
[02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:19.590]  the perfect condition for bugs and fucking funguses and problems. So the air conditioning
[02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:23.110]  and the humidity are always definitely the first thing that I think of. Yeah.
[02:52:24.230 --> 02:52:30.790]  A big grow room is a living organism that is full of lots of other smaller living organisms.
[02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:38.550]  I was explaining it to a buddy this way earlier today. And it itself has special care that needs
[02:52:38.550 --> 02:52:46.870]  done to it. Not just the plants inside of it. There's a lot to it. We've got 85 lights in the
[02:52:46.870 --> 02:52:54.310]  flower room at Green and Healthy and we run 50, that's 50 tons. We've got a 30 in the middle and
[02:52:54.310 --> 02:52:59.750]  two tens on the opposite sides. 50 tons of air conditioning to cool that. You got three air,
[02:52:59.750 --> 02:53:03.350]  see that's smart. Three air conditioners. If one goes down, you've still got-
[02:53:03.350 --> 02:53:07.030]  We got two backups that can kind of, if the 30 goes down, it gets warm.
[02:53:07.030 --> 02:53:07.750]  I bet it does.
[02:53:07.750 --> 02:53:11.430]  But luckily we're running Govitas with the Govita master controller. So you tell it that
[02:53:11.430 --> 02:53:15.990]  if it gets above 86 in here, I want you to dim the lights until it gets back down to 77 and then
[02:53:15.990 --> 02:53:20.150]  you can go back up if you need to. Yeah. That Govita master controller is awesome.
[02:53:20.150 --> 02:53:20.630]  Nice.
[02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:23.350]  We have to run two of them because we have so many lights. But I mean,
[02:53:23.350 --> 02:53:25.670]  they're so easy to program that it doesn't even matter.
[02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:27.270]  There are 50 lights each, right there.
[02:53:27.270 --> 02:53:28.550]  I think they only do 40.
[02:53:28.550 --> 02:53:29.110]  Really?
[02:53:30.230 --> 02:53:32.870]  And they have to do 50 because we're running 85 lights.
[02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:33.190]  Yeah.
[02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:34.070]  So yeah.
[02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:37.670]  The nanos do 199 each.
[02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:38.150]  Nice.
[02:53:38.950 --> 02:53:41.750]  But see what sucks about that is you still might have to buy
[02:53:42.470 --> 02:53:46.310]  multiple units if they're in different rooms because you can't break them into zones.
[02:53:46.310 --> 02:53:54.230]  Right. Luckily our room is 185 light, big, giant open room with like six rows of madness in it
[02:53:54.230 --> 02:54:00.230]  right now. Big shout out to my friends at VegBloom. If you are growing on a small scale, a medium scale
[02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:04.710]  or a large scale and you want nutrients to push your garden and you want to see what you can really
[02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:10.950]  do, fucking VegBloom is something I would recommend. It's affordable. It's easy to use.
[02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:16.550]  And so far I'm six, no, I'm seven weeks in and this is the best grow I've done at the
[02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:23.430]  Greener and Healthy Wellness Garden. And there's a run right next to it that was not VegBloom.
[02:54:23.430 --> 02:54:29.670]  And I've already passed the size of those buds. They're being harvested at week nine and these
[02:54:29.670 --> 02:54:33.110]  other buds are at week seven and they're already bigger than the week nine buds.
[02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:34.470]  So I support VegBloom.
[02:54:34.470 --> 02:54:35.830]  You're going to do three at night this one.
[02:54:37.190 --> 02:54:38.150]  That would be awesome.
[02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:42.870]  I mean, that's the only place you could go from your last performance.
[02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:46.950]  Right. Yeah. Last time we crushed it, we did pretty damn well. Shout out to the boys at
[02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:50.630]  Greener and Healthy Wellness and the whole Terp Jungle for helping me out. I appreciate it.
[02:54:51.270 --> 02:54:56.070]  Even shout out to the new guy. So not enough air conditioning. And then nobody considers
[02:54:56.070 --> 02:55:00.790]  getting rid of the humidity. There needs to be an exit for all of the moisture that comes into
[02:55:00.790 --> 02:55:05.190]  the room. You might be filling the room with CO2. Cool. But where's all of that old stagnant
[02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:08.710]  air going that's in there? You need to get rid of that shit. You don't want to be in there.
[02:55:08.710 --> 02:55:13.750]  If you walk into the grow room and it feels funky to you, it feels funky to the plants. You should
[02:55:13.750 --> 02:55:18.150]  be able to close your eyes and breathe and not notice that you've walked into a grow.
[02:55:19.030 --> 02:55:21.670]  It should just feel like normal, like this living room right here.
[02:55:21.670 --> 02:55:22.150]  It does.
[02:55:22.390 --> 02:55:25.910]  Swamp cooler going. It's a little funky in here, but we got a little dampness in the
[02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:29.590]  shirt from the swamp cooler, but it was like 90 something degrees today, man.
[02:55:32.230 --> 02:55:36.470]  Things I've noticed, humid, like we were talking earlier, foliar spraying,
[02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:44.310]  even just watering, brewing a damn tea, brewing 200 gallons of tea can spike the humidity.
[02:55:44.310 --> 02:55:49.990]  Oh yeah. You get that 200 gallons of tea too close to the lights and it just starts evaporating. It
[02:55:49.990 --> 02:55:54.470]  heats up the teas. Then all that moisture in the room carries heat and heats up the room as well.
[02:55:55.590 --> 02:55:59.830]  You go through the hot and cold cycles naturally through the day, the building getting heated up.
[02:56:00.870 --> 02:56:05.590]  Most of these grows are in fairly thin shelved commercial warehouses that
[02:56:06.390 --> 02:56:13.350]  aren't insulated as well as they could be. You get the heating and cooling effect from
[02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:15.910]  just the natural outside temperature.
[02:56:15.910 --> 02:56:21.350]  We had to build a concrete wall on the outside. We had to fur it, is I think the construction term.
[02:56:21.350 --> 02:56:26.550]  We had to fur a wall out six inches with concrete to insulate ourselves a little bit.
[02:56:26.550 --> 02:56:30.150]  Well, I'm glad to hear that you're not the only... I'm not the only person that
[02:56:30.790 --> 02:56:38.630]  might have to do this. The east wall of our facility, right about... Or no, the west wall,
[02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:46.070]  the west wall of the facility, the way it all sits, as the sun starts going down, it just makes
[02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:54.070]  it. The wall goes from being in the seventies all the way up into it's radiating heat. I can feel
[02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:58.790]  it. You can see those waves coming off when you go outside. Ours was the exact opposite. When the
[02:56:58.790 --> 02:57:03.910]  winter came, it got so cold on that wall that we could see moisture on the inside of the wall.
[02:57:03.910 --> 02:57:06.070]  Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, fuck.
[02:57:06.550 --> 02:57:08.630]  That wall's going to do that too if we don't fix it.
[02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:12.630]  Yeah, it is. Your wall's going to do the same thing. Then you'll get a PM issue because you're
[02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:15.910]  introducing moisture right there and that temperature fluctuation near that wall.
[02:57:17.430 --> 02:57:21.110]  Learn everything the damn hard way. Oh, yeah. No, I wouldn't have it any other way.
[02:57:21.110 --> 02:57:25.270]  You should have seen the guys that did the concrete over the front of the building.
[02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:30.950]  There were three dudes that didn't speak much English. They showed up in a truck with a truck,
[02:57:30.950 --> 02:57:35.430]  a wheelbarrow, a whole bunch of cement and some janky scaffolding.
[02:57:35.430 --> 02:57:38.550]  Oh, yeah. Two dudes carry the scaffolding to where they needed to be.
[02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:41.510]  And they just pointed and grunted a couple of times right here, right here, right here.
[02:57:42.870 --> 02:57:47.030]  They set up the first level and then one dude climbed that and they threw parts to him while
[02:57:47.030 --> 02:57:51.590]  he was standing on the scaffolding and he stuck them in place and then climbed up that and hung
[02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:55.030]  and grabbed other shit and built like a four-story scaffold by himself,
[02:57:55.590 --> 02:57:58.230]  climbed up and down it like a spider monkey, scared the shit out of me.
[02:57:59.110 --> 02:58:03.190]  So they start the cement from the top and let it run down kinda.
[02:58:03.190 --> 02:58:05.670]  And he's up on the top of the scaffolding and he yells,
[02:58:05.670 --> 02:58:09.190]  uno and the guy on the bottom is mixing cement in a wheelbarrow with those little
[02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:13.590]  trowel things in his hand. And he puts a pile on the thing and throws, he doesn't throw the
[02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:18.630]  tool, but he throws the concrete, just chucks it up into the air between the scaffolding.
[02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:21.350]  And the dude up top puts his trowel down, doesn't even look,
[02:58:21.350 --> 02:58:25.110]  catches that fucking cement on it and smears it on the wall like Danielson,
[02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:28.870]  left, right, left, right, left, right. And then he yells dos and the guy throws two of them up
[02:58:28.870 --> 02:58:32.710]  and he puts both of those little tools down and catches both of them and smears it on the wall.
[02:58:32.710 --> 02:58:36.870]  And he's running left and right and just yelling uno, dos as he gets to the middle and the guy
[02:58:36.870 --> 02:58:41.030]  throws how many he needs and he just keeps fucking smearing it. And as it's coming down,
[02:58:41.030 --> 02:58:44.950]  he goes to the top and pushes it down and then jumps to the next level and repeats.
[02:58:44.950 --> 02:58:48.390]  And then they got her all done and went back and smoothed it out. It took these three dudes
[02:58:48.390 --> 02:58:53.030]  seriously two hours to do the entire front of this fucking building, dude. It was amazing.
[02:58:53.110 --> 02:58:55.350]  Yeah. I would hire those guys for fucking anything.
[02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:59.430]  Um, that's our, so fuck you, Trump. Yeah.
[02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:04.950]  Hardworking motherfuckers. I mean, do you know my background? I worked in the construction industry
[02:59:04.950 --> 02:59:11.510]  for over a decade and there's a reason why there's not that many white guys employed in the
[02:59:11.510 --> 02:59:16.310]  construction industry anymore. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. Take that Trump. Yeah. Fuck you, Trump.
[02:59:16.950 --> 02:59:20.310]  I have no problem with, uh, hiring some illegals to come do some construction work.
[02:59:20.310 --> 02:59:24.230]  They do the shit that white people think they're too good to do. That's the truth. Fuck. Yeah. You
[02:59:24.230 --> 02:59:27.190]  couldn't pay me enough to do some of the shit that some of those guys would do just to make
[02:59:27.190 --> 02:59:30.870]  enough money to send home to their family. And that's, I have no problem with that. Do you think
[02:59:31.430 --> 02:59:37.510]  black tar roofing? I do draw the line there without a doubt. Yeah. I'm fucking white.
[02:59:37.510 --> 02:59:43.910]  Is this paper? You don't want me on a roof. No, honestly, any kind of roofing. I draw the line
[02:59:43.910 --> 02:59:48.870]  at, to be honest. It's horrible. All right. So you got to get air conditioning and humidity.
[02:59:48.870 --> 02:59:52.870]  You got to have an exit. You got to have a vent drawing stale air out of the building and getting
[02:59:52.870 --> 02:59:57.590]  it out of the ceiling. That's something super important when you're going from a basement grow
[02:59:57.590 --> 03:00:02.710]  to a larger commercial grow. Do you guys have to run, um, carbon filters?
[03:00:06.550 --> 03:00:11.110]  We should be, but we're allowed, we're allowed one more complaint before we get in trouble.
[03:00:11.750 --> 03:00:18.390]  I understand that. That's economics. The fine is cheaper than the filters that we need.
[03:00:19.270 --> 03:00:26.870]  We, we had to hear in Pueblo. That was the immediately, that was like one of their big
[03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:32.790]  concerns was carbon filters. And we've got six of those big fuckers all over ours. We've even got
[03:00:32.790 --> 03:00:37.990]  the inline ones on our air cooled pipes. We're disgustingly lucky because across the street from
[03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:43.990]  us is homework bound dog crematorium. And so every day around noon, you smell garlic bread
[03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:49.750]  and then you realize fucking cooking animals across the street. That's a dead animal being
[03:00:49.750 --> 03:00:54.310]  cremated. And so I told the new guy, we got a new guy and I smelled it the other day and I was like,
[03:00:54.310 --> 03:00:57.750]  Oh, I can't even let him do that. I walked into the other room where he wasn't going, Hey bro,
[03:00:57.750 --> 03:01:00.470]  you smell like garlic bread. And he goes, yeah, who's cooking? I go, that's the dog
[03:01:00.470 --> 03:01:04.790]  crematorium next door. Don't enjoy it too much. That's Rover. And he just looked at me like,
[03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:09.190]  that's, he said, that's fluffy. And I was like, yeah, they're just roasting that motherfucker.
[03:01:09.830 --> 03:01:14.310]  And it's funny because the first few days I worked there, I smelled something and there were two
[03:01:14.310 --> 03:01:17.830]  girls that used to work there that are no longer affiliated with us, but they used to work there.
[03:01:17.830 --> 03:01:21.910]  And they'd be like every day at like noon or two o'clock, I smelled garlic bread and they were
[03:01:21.910 --> 03:01:26.310]  standing in the grill room, just sucking it in one day. Like, where is it? It smells so good.
[03:01:27.030 --> 03:01:30.870]  And once I realized what it was a few days later, I was like, those girls were loving this.
[03:01:34.150 --> 03:01:37.590]  Oh man. Sorry. This podcast just got really morbid. That's awkward.
[03:01:37.990 --> 03:01:46.230]  The reason I brought it up is just carbon filter systems in a home grow versus a commercial grower,
[03:01:46.230 --> 03:01:51.670]  drastically different. Hugely different. Yeah. That's why I said, what we need is way expensive.
[03:01:51.670 --> 03:01:56.310]  We need like HIPAA filter grade shit. UV lighting possibly.
[03:01:57.990 --> 03:02:03.350]  I've got a small UV light that I use on small plantlings. I run it over. I just walk through
[03:02:03.350 --> 03:02:07.750]  the grow room and just hover that light about four to six inches over every little plant. And
[03:02:07.750 --> 03:02:12.150]  it keeps them nice and bug free because the bugs want nothing to do with that. And the PM,
[03:02:13.830 --> 03:02:18.310]  there is not any. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. So that thing is helpful. I was using that on another guy's
[03:02:18.310 --> 03:02:23.270]  garden that had bad PM. And I think it took eight days to just deteriorate all the PM.
[03:02:23.270 --> 03:02:27.910]  Damn. I got to get me one of those. I know an old guy that has not enough fucking filtration
[03:02:27.910 --> 03:02:32.310]  and refuses to blow the air out of his house because he's afraid. He keeps getting PM. So
[03:02:32.310 --> 03:02:36.230]  I keep learning new tricks on how to get rid of it for him. Yeah. Yeah. Keeps us on our toes.
[03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:39.990]  All right. So filtration is something that you super definitely need. Get that stale,
[03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:44.710]  funky air out. You're going to need UV lighting. You're going to need HIPAA filtration.
[03:02:44.710 --> 03:02:49.430]  Your air conditioners have exchanges and they're going to pull the air from the grow room.
[03:02:49.430 --> 03:02:52.790]  And that's going to blow back into your grow. But also a large portion of that is going to
[03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:57.110]  escape into the outside atmosphere. So you're going to be stinking it up that way also. So
[03:02:57.110 --> 03:03:02.070]  you need carbon scrubbers inside the grow. It's pretty fucking hard to keep the smell.
[03:03:02.070 --> 03:03:07.030]  It's so hard. If we didn't have a, and they, they came to us and they're like, Hey, uh,
[03:03:07.030 --> 03:03:10.790]  we can smell cannabis. And we're like, yeah, we would try to keep the smell down. How do you know
[03:03:10.790 --> 03:03:14.550]  it's us? And I said, well, we've been to all the other grows and you guys seem to know more what
[03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:19.910]  you're doing. They gave us a compliment. The MED in the city loves us. They they're because we're
[03:03:19.910 --> 03:03:23.190]  friends with them. I mean, we don't hide from them. There are some dispensary owners that don't
[03:03:23.190 --> 03:03:27.830]  get along with those people because they're shifty dicks and they're, they're just keeping it real.
[03:03:28.390 --> 03:03:32.070]  And we're yeah, yeah, yeah. They're keeping it real and we're trying to be on the legit side.
[03:03:32.630 --> 03:03:35.110]  We're cool. And they come over and went, Hey, what's up? I'm actually,
[03:03:37.110 --> 03:03:41.110]  I'm looking forward to our first visit because the place that we're getting out is completely
[03:03:41.110 --> 03:03:45.110]  different than some of the other places I've worked at. It's nice when you can look forward
[03:03:45.110 --> 03:03:49.030]  to MED visits. I know they'll have some issues. I'm sure they will. They're all,
[03:03:49.030 --> 03:03:53.510]  they're always going to, that's their job, but I'm not scared of anything. You know, that's
[03:03:54.390 --> 03:03:59.750]  anything that we have messed up on. It's either cause we didn't understand it properly or,
[03:03:59.750 --> 03:04:03.910]  right. You know, just invite the department of agriculture in for a walkthrough,
[03:04:03.910 --> 03:04:08.310]  like invite them. And then if you invite them, they won't give you any violations for whatever
[03:04:08.310 --> 03:04:12.070]  they find. They'll tell you to correct it since you invited them. And they'll be like, you've got
[03:04:12.070 --> 03:04:17.190]  90 days to get it corrected. And when we come back, that's when we'll actually be able to put
[03:04:17.190 --> 03:04:21.830]  you on like a warning notice. Yeah. So if you invite them, they show up and they're like, Oh,
[03:04:21.830 --> 03:04:25.270]  good job. Thank you. And then you can be like, I need help. Come show me what to correct.
[03:04:25.830 --> 03:04:28.870]  And that's kind of the way to do with the department of ag. And the guy that's been
[03:04:28.870 --> 03:04:33.270]  going around is fucking cool. I can't think of his name right now. Oh, I can almost remember
[03:04:33.270 --> 03:04:36.310]  his name in my head, but he's a cool little dude. He's an older dude. He's kind of a short guy,
[03:04:36.310 --> 03:04:39.990]  but he's cool. He's fun to hang out with. He's very informative, very educational.
[03:04:39.990 --> 03:04:43.430]  And he'll talk to you like you're a human. He won't treat you like a stupid grower. Like some
[03:04:43.430 --> 03:04:48.070]  of the industry people do like electricians and HVAC guys trying to talk to us like we're fucking
[03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:55.350]  retarded HVAC guys. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. I was dealing with one yesterday. I was about ready to
[03:04:55.350 --> 03:04:59.270]  strangle the guy. I just had to walk out of the office. I'm like, yeah, you're fucking idiot.
[03:04:59.270 --> 03:05:03.270]  Sorry. Yeah. Sometimes, sometimes some contractors are a pain in the ass to deal with. So that's
[03:05:03.270 --> 03:05:07.990]  something to look forward to when you're building your big grow, find some contractors that you can
[03:05:07.990 --> 03:05:13.110]  trust. Um, and Pueblo good fucking luck. If you're in Pueblo, Colorado, you'd be better off paying
[03:05:13.110 --> 03:05:18.550]  cruise from Denver to come down and build your grow. In my opinion, is that, is that a good,
[03:05:18.550 --> 03:05:25.430]  good, a good builder? He's decent. Okay. And he's very connected in the city. Um, he knows he's on
[03:05:25.430 --> 03:05:29.590]  first name basis with everyone. So it goes pretty smoothly. All right. So check this out. If you're
[03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:34.950]  trying to get a grow bill in Colorado, in the Pueblo, Colorado region, find a guy who does
[03:05:34.950 --> 03:05:39.830]  construction by the name of gag Liano gag Liano's construction in Pueblo, Colorado. When you contact
[03:05:39.830 --> 03:05:44.230]  them, be like, Hey, I was listening to a podcast. This guy named Ross to Jeff told me about you. So
[03:05:44.230 --> 03:05:49.030]  anything that we do business with you owe him 2% commission and just make sure that he sends me 2%,
[03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:55.830]  2%. It's not a lot to ask. No, no, it's not. It's 2%. If you got a dollar, you'd give me,
[03:05:55.830 --> 03:06:00.470]  if you had a dollar in exchange, that's where I'm headed with this. If it was in coins on the floor,
[03:06:00.470 --> 03:06:04.630]  you wouldn't care if I picked up two pennies, two pennies, bro. If you got to break a buck,
[03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:10.070]  I get it. That's breaking the big one. But if you got the soft, the soft hundred pennies,
[03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:14.710]  you can take two of them. Find yourself a good contractor is the point of all this.
[03:06:14.710 --> 03:06:18.070]  Yes. Yeah. Because contractors can fuck up your whole day. I worked in another facility
[03:06:18.630 --> 03:06:23.590]  that the blueprint was drawn by one guy. The HVAC system was designed by another and the electrical,
[03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:26.950]  which we're going to talk about in a minute, was designed by another guy. And they were all,
[03:06:26.950 --> 03:06:33.910]  it was like, we took a Ferrari engine, maybe a Porsche turbo kit, and then maybe like a
[03:06:33.910 --> 03:06:37.830]  Lamborghini body. And then the suspension system for a Corvette. And they're like,
[03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:42.790]  you got all these dope ass parts, make it go fast, Ricky Bobby. And like fucking, we're like,
[03:06:42.790 --> 03:06:47.590]  eh, but the air conditioning doesn't work when you turn on all the lights. Like there's not
[03:06:47.590 --> 03:06:52.550]  enough power to do all of it. So, so like, yeah, you need good contractors, good engineers,
[03:06:52.550 --> 03:06:57.030]  a fucking engineer. That's very key is an engineer that understands.
[03:06:57.030 --> 03:07:02.790]  Yeah. Cause you're not always going to find a contractor that understands indoor cultivation.
[03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:05.030]  They don't understand how much humidity is coming.
[03:07:05.030 --> 03:07:10.790]  Rarely we'll find a contractor that understands it, but you can find engineers that know what
[03:07:10.790 --> 03:07:16.790]  they're doing and engineers are smart people. You can explain shit to them. So yeah, that's,
[03:07:17.430 --> 03:07:20.790]  that was real key in the Uncle Bud company development. We had a really good engineer.
[03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:24.310]  Let's talk about that in a minute. Also, I'll let you give them a nice plug. I'm going to write it
[03:07:24.310 --> 03:07:30.550]  down so that I remember. I was able to relay concerns I had to, to them. And I'm like, you
[03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:35.190]  know, we got to make sure this doesn't happen. Like electricity. I was like, we just have to
[03:07:35.190 --> 03:07:38.230]  have plenty of electricity. Plenty. Three phase power all day long.
[03:07:38.230 --> 03:07:40.950]  Yeah. Well, not quite, but we got two meters, so.
[03:07:40.950 --> 03:07:43.910]  Okay. How many amps are you allowed to pull?
[03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:48.070]  We were 400 on both. That's on each box?
[03:07:48.070 --> 03:07:49.750]  Yeah. So you get 800 total amps?
[03:07:49.750 --> 03:07:53.350]  Nowhere near drawing full capacity at the moment. That's a lot of amperage.
[03:07:53.350 --> 03:07:54.550]  Yeah. Yeah. That's a lot.
[03:07:54.550 --> 03:07:58.470]  Did you get to flip the fucking on switch? We've got two inside.
[03:07:58.470 --> 03:07:59.670]  Have you ever done it? Yeah.
[03:07:59.750 --> 03:08:03.830]  Does it feel ridiculous when it, when the contacts touch all that power?
[03:08:04.630 --> 03:08:09.990]  It's not something you can do. Like if you, if you're not strong enough to push it all the way
[03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:14.070]  through, you don't want to do it. Like, cause that's a lot of power.
[03:08:14.070 --> 03:08:15.030]  That's a lot of freaking electricity.
[03:08:15.030 --> 03:08:17.270]  You don't want to take a chance of shorting something there.
[03:08:17.270 --> 03:08:21.990]  Yeah. Oh yeah. You just got to go just push it. Yeah. And some smaller folks might not be able
[03:08:21.990 --> 03:08:25.990]  to push that thing all the way. You're a little wiry dude. I can see Adam up there trying to push
[03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:28.310]  all day. Adam and 44.
[03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:30.710]  Adam and Dee both?
[03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:32.230]  Yeah. Dee on top trying to...
[03:08:33.270 --> 03:08:34.310]  Dee with his broken hand.
[03:08:34.310 --> 03:08:35.350]  Okay. Let's stop there.
[03:08:35.350 --> 03:08:39.750]  All right. Yeah. This is not the Colorado. They don't get any love. What are we talking about?
[03:08:39.750 --> 03:08:45.350]  All right. So another thing we kind of touched on this one, get a fucking certified, qualified,
[03:08:45.350 --> 03:08:47.350]  reliable, professional electrician.
[03:08:47.350 --> 03:08:48.310]  Yes. Very much so.
[03:08:48.310 --> 03:08:51.270]  If your contractors do fuck up, you can fire them.
[03:08:51.270 --> 03:08:51.590]  Oh yeah.
[03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:54.070]  Don't just be like, you know, I hired this guy. I got to stick with him. No,
[03:08:54.070 --> 03:08:55.590]  you fucking don't. You're not dating.
[03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:59.750]  And you can call them on it and you can make them come back and fix it or take away their
[03:08:59.750 --> 03:09:01.670]  junk and you're not going to pay for it.
[03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:02.310]  There you go.
[03:09:02.310 --> 03:09:02.710]  That's...
[03:09:02.710 --> 03:09:06.870]  Take away their junk. Every contractor has got a pile of his shit in your facility while he's
[03:09:06.870 --> 03:09:11.910]  working there. Hold it hostage until you get what the fuck you need. Do that. That's kind of a
[03:09:11.910 --> 03:09:14.870]  fucked up way to go about it. But if you just lock the doors and you're like, bro, you done
[03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:19.030]  fucked up. My walls are all crooked. Make my wall straight and then I'll pay you. Then that's,
[03:09:19.030 --> 03:09:23.510]  you got to do shit right. The flooring. Flooring has always been a bitch in every facility I've
[03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:27.990]  been to. The flooring has been an issue. It's just hard to get floors right in this industry.
[03:09:27.990 --> 03:09:32.790]  I'll have, I've got a brand name of specific paint for you, but I don't know it off the top
[03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:39.430]  of my head. I'll let you know. It's been great. I've got one little flake out of 2000 square feet.
[03:09:39.430 --> 03:09:40.230]  Oh shit. Yeah.
[03:09:40.230 --> 03:09:44.630]  Yeah. It's had almost three months of work on top of it.
[03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:46.870]  And I bet you dropped something heavy to get that one chip.
[03:09:46.870 --> 03:09:47.430]  Yeah. Yeah.
[03:09:48.230 --> 03:09:49.990]  The grit on your face is awesome.
[03:09:49.990 --> 03:09:51.670]  It was a stainless steel table.
[03:09:51.670 --> 03:09:54.630]  They knew it was a table. I fucking knew it was a long ass Hydra table.
[03:09:54.630 --> 03:09:54.870]  Yeah.
[03:09:56.070 --> 03:09:59.110]  Yeah. I like tables. Put your plants on tables, guys. Raise them up off the ground. Get them up
[03:09:59.110 --> 03:10:01.190]  where you can work on them. It's so awesome. I love it.
[03:10:01.190 --> 03:10:07.670]  We've got ours on the floor right now. That's something, uh, cleaning, uh, mopping up after
[03:10:07.670 --> 03:10:14.630]  six plants, 12 plants is one thing. Mopping up after 176 plants is a completely different story.
[03:10:14.630 --> 03:10:20.390]  I've got an assistant grower now and every like few days he's like, what do you want me to do,
[03:10:20.390 --> 03:10:23.910]  bro? And I'm like, just clean up. He's like, seriously? Like, yeah, just go fucking
[03:10:23.910 --> 03:10:28.630]  every little random thing. That's fallen out of a plant, all the perlite that's on a table or any
[03:10:28.630 --> 03:10:31.990]  whatever. If there's a pair of scissors laying around, go clean all that shit.
[03:10:31.990 --> 03:10:33.030]  Measuring jars.
[03:10:33.030 --> 03:10:36.710]  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Start from the top in the flower room, go all the way down. If there's
[03:10:36.710 --> 03:10:41.030]  old trellis for old pots in there from something that's been harvested, that's got to go sweep
[03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:46.790]  every goddamn corner. Get out the shop vac suck up underneath all the weird random little nooks
[03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:51.350]  and crannies that we got in there. Anything that's not going to be used doesn't need to be
[03:10:51.350 --> 03:10:56.870]  in the flower room. I don't think like scissors and boxes of material that shit should go in the
[03:10:56.870 --> 03:11:00.230]  storage room, store that or put it right outside the flower room.
[03:11:00.230 --> 03:11:02.550]  If you're fortunate enough to have a storage room.
[03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:05.910]  Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um,
[03:11:05.910 --> 03:11:11.430]  put the broom and dustpan and trash can outside the flower room. Put that shit outside. Just don't
[03:11:11.430 --> 03:11:16.390]  have that in the flowering room or the bedroom. Simple little tasks that you don't even think
[03:11:16.390 --> 03:11:23.190]  about doing in a small grow can literally take days in a big defoliating. Oh my God. Shaving legs,
[03:11:23.190 --> 03:11:29.350]  shaving legs and defoliating. I know you guys are all netting, but I'm doing a big seed run. So
[03:11:29.350 --> 03:11:35.190]  that wasn't really an option. Like double and triple layer trellising. I get crazy on it.
[03:11:35.190 --> 03:11:41.030]  I can't wait. Bend them down. But uh, yeah, it's, it's a lot of work.
[03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:48.070]  So much work. I've got a guy that, um, a former employee that would defoliate the entire room
[03:11:48.070 --> 03:11:54.310]  for an entire shift. And he would do, uh, 10, five gallon buckets full of leaves. And he would
[03:11:54.310 --> 03:11:59.110]  push them down. Like you just chop leaves all day and then go back and scoop up the leaves out of
[03:11:59.110 --> 03:12:02.470]  the trays into five gallon buckets. And he'd probably fill 10, five gallon buckets. He'd
[03:12:02.470 --> 03:12:07.190]  fill one of those big, uh, like 30 gallon trash cans, halfway full with just leaves
[03:12:07.430 --> 03:12:11.750]  from the first run of defoliating things you don't have to do in the basement. We have to weigh all
[03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:18.230]  that and we have to track it. That's I hate that part of it. So document what all that shit weighed.
[03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:25.350]  Yeah. Manicured weight. I didn't even manicure and I just pulled the leaf off. So we've got, uh,
[03:12:26.310 --> 03:12:30.470]  you know how you're supposed to like mix it with soil or vinegar oil or something like that before
[03:12:30.470 --> 03:12:34.310]  you can throw it away. Okay. Yeah. Let's say let's catch the listeners up though. In a commercial grow
[03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:40.790]  when you, if you have, see maybe a bud isn't desirable or they're the bottom part of the
[03:12:40.790 --> 03:12:44.950]  plant. I throw that shit away when that's in the trash can. You have to cut it up into little tiny
[03:12:44.950 --> 03:12:50.870]  pieces and then you have to mix it like Jesse said with a soil or kitty litter is what they
[03:12:50.870 --> 03:12:57.190]  recommended or gravel or vinegar or something else that you can put in there. Cooking oil. Yeah.
[03:12:57.190 --> 03:13:02.150]  Anything to make it unusable and unrecognizable. So you've sounds like you got a good idea.
[03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:07.270]  Yeah. We've got three worm farms. There you go. Yeah. Feed it to the worms. Yeah. Yeah. And they're
[03:13:07.270 --> 03:13:12.630]  loving it too. I'm sure they love their canna meal. That's the best. We use a shit ton of worm
[03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:19.190]  castings too. So it helps cut down costs there. There you go. Pre-cycling. Yeah. That's awesome.
[03:13:20.390 --> 03:13:24.870]  That's a good way to do it. Yeah. That's when we get our greenhouse built, um,
[03:13:25.830 --> 03:13:30.230]  we've got a whole wall in the greenhouse. It's going to be a shelf system full of
[03:13:30.230 --> 03:13:35.190]  worm bins and everything. Worm shit and into a, into a funnel. Yeah. It's just a worm shit funnel.
[03:13:35.190 --> 03:13:39.910]  Just tunnel it down. Damn. That's pretty rad. We've, uh, we grind it up pretty small. We chop
[03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:44.870]  it up. I chop it up with, uh, like the, uh, the shears just go ham on it with the shears.
[03:13:44.870 --> 03:13:49.270]  And then, uh, we make lasagna. Basically we take the old pot that the plant's been harvested from
[03:13:49.830 --> 03:13:53.190]  and shake that soil into the trash can. We let them dry. They've all sat around and
[03:13:53.190 --> 03:13:57.030]  dried for a couple of days. Dump all that soil into the trash can, throw a bunch of the waste
[03:13:57.030 --> 03:14:01.910]  into their dump, a couple more pots, more soil, a couple more pot or more waste. Yeah. Just keep
[03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:06.230]  it like that. So that's a way to get rid of all of our old soil at the same time and kind of be
[03:14:06.230 --> 03:14:11.190]  used to have a use for it instead of just wasting all that good dirt. Cause I know it's recyclable.
[03:14:11.190 --> 03:14:18.230]  I totally know. And we use so much cocoa. Uh, we buy 14 big bags of cocoa at a time when we go,
[03:14:18.230 --> 03:14:22.550]  because that's what fits in hunt's car. Oh, you're talking like the big, tall bags of those
[03:14:22.550 --> 03:14:26.710]  bags that are right there. The, uh, 1.75 cubic feet. Those are bigger than your average bag.
[03:14:26.710 --> 03:14:29.830]  Yeah. Okay. All right. That's what I, that's what I use at the house now too, is cocoa.
[03:14:30.710 --> 03:14:34.550]  And shout out to a shout out to way to grow. I hope nobody's heard me burp into that microphone.
[03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:38.390]  Excuse me. A shout out to the way to grow. I was buying cocoa grow the other day. I really
[03:14:38.390 --> 03:14:44.070]  liked the botanic hair cocoa grow. I don't prefer the aeration bag. Just get the cocoa. It's just
[03:14:44.070 --> 03:14:48.230]  fine. You don't need that aeration in there. I don't like that shit. Uh, but way to grow is nice
[03:14:48.230 --> 03:14:53.670]  enough to throw in a bunch of bags of Fox farms, ocean forest soil for free. They carried that
[03:14:53.670 --> 03:14:57.030]  shit to my car. And like you buy a lot of shit here, bro. Here you go. These are for you. And
[03:14:57.030 --> 03:15:01.110]  I was like, fuck yeah, dude, I know exactly where that soil was going. So shout out to my friends
[03:15:01.110 --> 03:15:04.310]  at way to grow. They know who they are. I don't know if they listened to the podcast. If you do
[03:15:04.310 --> 03:15:08.550]  listen to the podcast, contact me because I'd love to have you as a sponsor on the show. It'd be rad.
[03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:13.350]  Yeah. The rusted Jeff account. They know my account name and they laugh every time they hear
[03:15:13.350 --> 03:15:17.590]  it. They laugh every time. Cause we've got the commercial account and the name of the account
[03:15:17.590 --> 03:15:22.390]  is really funny. Nice. They know, they know the name now. You know what the type in when I walk
[03:15:22.390 --> 03:15:27.910]  up to the register. Oh, you told me one time. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny. It's really funny. All
[03:15:27.910 --> 03:15:31.030]  right. So you need a good fucking electrician. You need a way to get rid of humidity. You need
[03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:35.670]  a way to get rid of heat. You need plenty of air conditioning. You got to seal up all the cracks,
[03:15:35.670 --> 03:15:39.670]  all the nooks and crannies. You got to be able to clean the fuck out of this place. It's got
[03:15:39.670 --> 03:15:43.750]  to be a semi clean facility. You don't want some old car garage where the floor is all greasy.
[03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:50.950]  You need a floor drain. Floor drains are crucial. Absolutely. Yeah. And water, you need access to
[03:15:50.950 --> 03:15:56.070]  water. A lot of warehouses out in Pueblo by the airport, they don't have water ran to them because
[03:15:56.070 --> 03:16:01.830]  they didn't need water for anything. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's truth. Yeah. So there's, if you get one
[03:16:01.830 --> 03:16:06.950]  of those warehouses out there, sorry, I just had to make sure it was on track here. If you get one
[03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:11.030]  of those warehouses out there, you might not have water. You're going to have to be getting trucks
[03:16:11.030 --> 03:16:14.470]  of water. You're going to have to pay to get water out there. Something people aren't aware of.
[03:16:14.470 --> 03:16:22.870]  If you get a large grow on private land out, say in Pueblo County somewhere, you have to get water
[03:16:22.870 --> 03:16:27.110]  rights. You're not, just because you have land, it doesn't mean you're granted water rights.
[03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:32.230]  Even if there's a well there, you have to purchase water to offset what you're taking
[03:16:32.230 --> 03:16:38.070]  out of the aquifer. Exactly. Yep. And if there are enough grows around that area that that
[03:16:38.070 --> 03:16:43.110]  jurisdiction deems the water is compromised by you coming, they can decline your water rights.
[03:16:43.110 --> 03:16:48.310]  You can't have any water. Absolutely. Yeah. And this, I mean, even to the point that they don't
[03:16:48.310 --> 03:16:54.390]  care that you're going to town to buy it and that you have a big truck. It's sorry. Yeah. Yeah.
[03:16:54.390 --> 03:16:59.670]  You can't prove that. I've got a inside track with the department of natural resources. Now,
[03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:04.710]  if anyone has any questions or anything, you can hit me up. There you go. Message our friend,
[03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:09.750]  Jesse. We're fun. All of the great people that we meet, these people would never take you and
[03:17:09.750 --> 03:17:15.430]  I seriously. Jesse's got a semi ponytail, a beard fucking tattooed up. He's got, is that a trout on
[03:17:15.430 --> 03:17:20.390]  your arm? Yes. He's got to do it. I knew it was a trout. That's so rad. He's got a trout on his arm.
[03:17:20.390 --> 03:17:25.350]  He's got a Colorado flag. He's got a chili. That's just one arm. Oh, he's got a Monarch butterfly
[03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:31.990]  and a snowboard. Yeah, man. That's just one arm. He's tatted up. And I bet a lot of the, and I'm
[03:17:31.990 --> 03:17:36.870]  six, five with dreadlocks and red eyes. It's pretty much a good discount, a crooked hat.
[03:17:36.870 --> 03:17:41.190]  Yeah. And I just wear Dickies every day because I destroy clothes and it's easier just to wear
[03:17:41.190 --> 03:17:45.350]  Dickies that are indestructible. And these contractors and business folks would never
[03:17:45.350 --> 03:17:49.830]  have taken us seriously before this cannabis industry. And I find it so funny. I've noticed
[03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:55.110]  when I go to restaurants in Denver and I'm wearing like a, just the dad kid shirt, basically my Irish
[03:17:55.110 --> 03:18:00.550]  shirt and my hat, crooked and appendix and skate shoes. And my Dickies and I walk in red eyed
[03:18:00.550 --> 03:18:04.870]  before restaurants would kind of be a dick to me. They'd kind of be like, Oh, this guy's here.
[03:18:04.870 --> 03:18:08.710]  Like he's fucking up our vibe. But now there's always some young hip waitress. It's like,
[03:18:08.710 --> 03:18:11.910]  what's up guys that work in the weed industry. You're going to tip the fuck out of me. You want
[03:18:11.910 --> 03:18:17.270]  some great service, honey. They're what? Rich? Yeah, completely. Yep. Yep. Yep. I don't want,
[03:18:17.270 --> 03:18:21.510]  I don't want fancy things. I want a nice, uh, some good hash and live comfortably. I'm going
[03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:25.030]  to go to a lot of good shows. I'm going to go see the dead whenever they come around. I'm going to
[03:18:25.030 --> 03:18:29.110]  go see fish every time they're around. Do you check out the dead company? I saw the dead and
[03:18:29.110 --> 03:18:34.550]  Cohen. It was fucking rad. This most recent one. Yeah. This one. Yeah. Just this recent one when
[03:18:34.550 --> 03:18:40.710]  they're in Boulder at Folsom field. Nice. Super awesome. I got to see one of these shows. Yeah.
[03:18:40.710 --> 03:18:45.430]  You have to come with me one time. Yeah. You'll have a good time. I used to, I used to eat a
[03:18:45.430 --> 03:18:48.470]  bunch of psychedelic drugs when I used to go to those shows and I've quit doing that. I had a
[03:18:48.470 --> 03:18:52.070]  head injury. Anybody that listens to the podcast for a long time, heard about the head injury.
[03:18:52.070 --> 03:18:58.230]  It's been a year and a half and I still have effects from it. Like I hate to admit it and
[03:18:58.230 --> 03:19:02.870]  talk about it, but I still have like TBI. I've got post concussion syndrome and I've got a
[03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:09.030]  traumatic brain injury still. I played high school football very competitively. I had
[03:19:09.910 --> 03:19:15.750]  major concussions in high school and I know I didn't let them heal up correctly. Right. And I
[03:19:15.750 --> 03:19:20.070]  wonder sometimes how that affects me. You ever, you ever doing shit and you go, Oh, that's from
[03:19:20.070 --> 03:19:25.030]  that time. I hit my head. Do you ever have those moments? Um, I have those moments where I wonder
[03:19:25.990 --> 03:19:29.670]  I just blame it on that anyway. I'm like, yep, that's, that's from the time I smacked myself
[03:19:31.190 --> 03:19:36.070]  right now when I'm reaching to the left for no reason in my jackets to the right. That is why
[03:19:36.070 --> 03:19:41.430]  that's from the time I smacked my head. All right. Let's try to get back on track. I don't even know
[03:19:41.430 --> 03:19:46.870]  where the fuck we were talking about concussions and building grows large facility, large facilities.
[03:19:46.870 --> 03:19:52.470]  Yeah. Have a first aid kit. Oh yeah. Talking about needing water. Oh yeah. Water tanks,
[03:19:52.470 --> 03:19:58.390]  water filtration. Um, your average on the shelf, grow store water filter can't handle the amount
[03:19:58.390 --> 03:20:05.510]  of water that you need. A lot of water. I use a thousand gallons of water every 48 hours to grow.
[03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:14.470]  And that's 105 lights total. I'm doing a hundred and 55 to 165 right now. Okay. Super still not
[03:20:14.470 --> 03:20:18.630]  even at full capacity. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in full flower and I've got plants that are five feet
[03:20:18.630 --> 03:20:23.430]  tall with big fucking donkey dick buds on them. And either way, that's still a lot more than your
[03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:29.430]  basement growth. Oh, so much more. Yeah. If you're using, I figure you use about indoors,
[03:20:29.430 --> 03:20:34.470]  you probably use five gallons of water per light every 48 to 72 hours ish.
[03:20:36.310 --> 03:20:39.670]  Yeah. For the most part. That's the way I used to. So if you guys are trying to figure out how
[03:20:39.670 --> 03:20:44.390]  much water you should be using in your indoor, every 1000 watt or 600 watt light, 600, a thousand
[03:20:44.390 --> 03:20:48.550]  watt light, it should be running about five gallons every 24 to 48 hours. If your temperatures
[03:20:48.550 --> 03:20:51.670]  and your humidity and everything are dialed in and your plants are at their optimum growth,
[03:20:52.390 --> 03:20:54.790]  your plants are growing a little slow. You're probably overwatering them.
[03:20:56.790 --> 03:21:01.350]  I would agree. Yeah. That's usually the first sign of overwatering some plants. Outdoors. It's
[03:21:01.350 --> 03:21:09.030]  going to be average. I'd say five gallons of plant per plant per day, per day. Uh,
[03:21:09.670 --> 03:21:13.510]  even when it gets super hot, is it okay to just turn on the hose and just let the hose just
[03:21:13.510 --> 03:21:23.110]  fucking flood those outdoor plants? Um, yes, for the most part. Uh, I try to concentrate it more
[03:21:23.110 --> 03:21:27.110]  just around the plant. Cause I feel like it's wasting, you know, just to conserve it more.
[03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:33.750]  Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, you could totally do like, uh, field flood irrigation. I actually know of a
[03:21:33.830 --> 03:21:39.750]  wholesale place here in Pueblo County that floods are filled. Um, just like they do with cantaloupe
[03:21:39.750 --> 03:21:45.110]  or watermelon or anything. Yeah. Yeah. Just flood the whole field out, let it soak and let it dry
[03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:50.710]  and reflood it. So just doing a flood and drain outdoor. Basically. That's yeah. Okay. Yeah. I
[03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:55.430]  think they do it like two or three times a season. I need to go explore and visit more of these, uh,
[03:21:55.430 --> 03:21:59.110]  outdoor cannabis and hemp grows. I want to see how you guys are doing a lot of this shit. I want to
[03:21:59.110 --> 03:22:03.030]  learn from your tech. I want to see what I can implement into my indoor tech. I can show you a
[03:22:03.030 --> 03:22:08.150]  couple of cool ones. Yeah. I'd love to see a bunch of big stuff. Um, the something pretty,
[03:22:08.150 --> 03:22:14.950]  I think it's pretty cool. The overwhelming majority of these places are no-till raised bed.
[03:22:14.950 --> 03:22:21.510]  Oh, neat. Yeah. So no-till you guys, they, uh, they make an amended soil with a lot of special
[03:22:21.510 --> 03:22:26.390]  amendments and then very specific amendments that I'm ignorant to. Honestly, I don't know what goes
[03:22:26.390 --> 03:22:37.350]  into that. A lot of, um, life. Okay. Yeah. It's a warm castings, live worms, live worms. Okay. So
[03:22:37.350 --> 03:22:42.790]  it's, it's living soil, you guys. And the plants are harvested and do you pull out the big root
[03:22:42.790 --> 03:22:48.710]  ball or you just leave that in there? You pull out the stem around it. Okay. Try, you actually
[03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:51.910]  want to leave as much of the root ball in there as you can because the worms are going to eat it
[03:22:52.870 --> 03:22:57.590]  into nutrients for the plant again. Life. So I've gone in circles, you pull the plan out
[03:22:57.590 --> 03:23:04.070]  and you put a new one in and you send her off again. Um, they use a lot of cover crops and
[03:23:04.070 --> 03:23:09.350]  stuff like that in them. Okay. So you're stacking stuff into the pot and then the worms will eat
[03:23:09.350 --> 03:23:13.830]  all of that. Mostly that stuff will decompose and become plant. And then, so you're going to start
[03:23:13.830 --> 03:23:17.910]  losing a little bit of depth every time, right? That's the depth of the soil is going to move
[03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:21.990]  down and then you can just refill it with your fresh. That's how you recharge. No-till is you
[03:23:21.990 --> 03:23:27.190]  that's awesome. Go back in top dress and all your recharged amendments. That's pretty awesome. I
[03:23:27.190 --> 03:23:33.910]  never thought of that. It's a, it's extremely economical. That's why most of these places are
[03:23:33.910 --> 03:23:38.630]  running out and they're such large scale that it's just, did the plants taste good? Cause
[03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:42.950]  I think being an indoor grower who uses mainly bottled nutrients for most of my grow career,
[03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:47.910]  I've always been taught to flush my plants. Are they always, are they those guys that say,
[03:23:47.910 --> 03:23:52.310]  I don't need to flush because I've been flushing the whole time. Is that those guys? Okay. So
[03:23:52.310 --> 03:23:55.990]  since they're not feeding a whole bunch of bottled nutrients, a bunch of chelated salts,
[03:23:55.990 --> 03:23:59.030]  their plants aren't backed up with stuff. Their plants are probably more able to,
[03:23:59.590 --> 03:24:05.350]  uh, I don't, I can't even remember the word right now. It's a simile. Uh, all of the nutrients that
[03:24:05.350 --> 03:24:08.470]  are going through, they can use it a little bit better. It comes up and goes down. They get rid
[03:24:08.470 --> 03:24:12.390]  of a little more. Okay. Kind of buffet style. They get to pick and choose. Yeah. Instead of
[03:24:12.390 --> 03:24:17.270]  just being force fed. Yeah. It's crazy. The plants actually finish themselves off. They start fading
[03:24:17.270 --> 03:24:21.910]  just like you, they would if they're flooded. I mean flushed. So they know they're just like,
[03:24:21.910 --> 03:24:28.310]  Hey, my season's done. Yeah. All right. It's neat. Do you see a difference in specific strains? Does
[03:24:28.950 --> 03:24:32.630]  strain A versus strain B, do they finish differently in the no-till outdoor?
[03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:37.750]  I haven't done enough of it to say that. I was just curious if that was nutrients running out
[03:24:37.750 --> 03:24:41.190]  or if that was actually the plant realizing, Hey, I'm done. I'm flushing myself.
[03:24:43.270 --> 03:24:49.910]  I know in my experience, um, the way I grow in the grounds kind of no-till pretty much. I know
[03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:55.750]  Girl Scout cookies and Flo will finish themselves off. I doubt the forum cut Girl Scout cookies.
[03:24:55.750 --> 03:25:03.670]  Flo will finish herself off you guys. All right. We've been going for about an hour. Let's, uh,
[03:25:03.670 --> 03:25:07.910]  let's start wrapping it up because I'm actually expecting dinner to show up in the next 20 or 30
[03:25:07.910 --> 03:25:12.390]  minutes. I just started thinking about that about 15 minutes ago. I saw you messing with your phone.
[03:25:12.390 --> 03:25:16.790]  I was like, he's dealing with his dinner. That's exactly what that was. It was, Hey,
[03:25:16.790 --> 03:25:20.950]  I'll be there in 15. And I said, give us 30. I actually got to go fully or spray some plants.
[03:25:22.070 --> 03:25:26.950]  What are you going to spray? Uh, essential oils. Oh, okay. So pesticide pest management,
[03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:33.590]  integrated pest management with essential oils. We are to, um, 13 days into flower.
[03:25:35.590 --> 03:25:41.030]  Just about the end of that spray period right now. And the lights just shut off. So I'm going to go
[03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:46.790]  and I'm with it a few more times and get in there with that green light. Yeah. You were the
[03:25:46.790 --> 03:25:50.710]  forehead green light, or do you have a room light? No, I got the forehead one. I don't like the
[03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:56.230]  full room ones. Okay. So inevitably that light switch always gets left on. Right. And you don't
[03:25:56.230 --> 03:25:59.350]  notice it when all the other lights are on. Right. So you just running that green light for
[03:25:59.350 --> 03:26:04.310]  nothing all day. A little CFL. I like the green light on my head. Cause then it's looking where
[03:26:04.310 --> 03:26:08.070]  I'm looking. Yeah. It's actually focused where I am instead of just the needle get shadows.
[03:26:09.750 --> 03:26:13.910]  Yeah. I shadow myself. I got dreadlocks. If the lights from behind, I don't see shit.
[03:26:15.670 --> 03:26:19.670]  All right. We've talked a lot about building, getting your large commercial grow going. Do
[03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:22.630]  you have any things that you want to add before we start wrapping this up so that I don't cut
[03:26:22.630 --> 03:26:29.350]  off any of your useful data for our listeners? Find a person that can be vouched for by many
[03:26:29.350 --> 03:26:34.870]  people throughout the community to work with your engineer, to help design your building
[03:26:35.430 --> 03:26:41.030]  and pay him what he is worth. Like, you know, if it'll be a guy like me or Jeff,
[03:26:41.590 --> 03:26:48.630]  and even if he's not going to grow for you, pay him what it's worth and your end product
[03:26:48.630 --> 03:26:52.550]  will drastically improve and work better by doing that.
[03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:59.110]  In my first week and green and healthy wellness, I made minor improvements that improved the
[03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:05.110]  financial. It just made sense. I fixed their books a little bit just by fucking doing a
[03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:09.030]  couple of adjustments, like making the garden more, more profitable just by eliminating this
[03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:13.350]  and adding this. It just took me a week to make a whole bunch of small improvements,
[03:27:13.350 --> 03:27:17.750]  just because the person who set it up and was running it was not an experienced grower,
[03:27:17.830 --> 03:27:25.270]  was not... I don't want to bash this person, but they weren't a forward thinker. They didn't look
[03:27:25.270 --> 03:27:28.550]  far enough into the future. They didn't have foresight to realize that if I don't put glue
[03:27:28.550 --> 03:27:34.710]  here, this shit's going to come apart eventually. So I fixed a lot of just small details. They
[03:27:34.710 --> 03:27:37.910]  didn't have any heaters in the... So it was winter when I started, there were no heaters in the
[03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:42.150]  reservoirs and they're feeding the plants 54 degree water and they couldn't get the pH of the
[03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:46.550]  fucking water to come up. They're just pouring in pH. They couldn't get it to go down. They just
[03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:50.310]  poured in a half a gallon of pH down and it won't move. And I was like, stuck my hand in.
[03:27:50.310 --> 03:27:51.110]  Because it's so cold.
[03:27:51.110 --> 03:27:54.390]  Yeah. And I stuck my hand in there and I was like, oh my God. And they go, put your hand in
[03:27:54.390 --> 03:27:57.590]  there, bro. I go, where does the water come from? He goes, the hose. I was like, oh, it's a
[03:27:57.590 --> 03:28:02.070]  municipal water. It's coming from the fucking line. It's underground and it's 30 degrees outside. So
[03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:06.550]  I stuck a thermometer in there and that water was 54 degrees. I was like, well, that's why the pH
[03:28:06.550 --> 03:28:09.830]  won't move. And that's why the plants have the claw. They all had the fucking downward claw,
[03:28:09.830 --> 03:28:13.190]  but the plants were purple. Everything was purple. They were happy about that.
[03:28:14.150 --> 03:28:18.150]  But so I put aquarium heaters in there. I was like, let's go to the fish store and get the
[03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:22.310]  biggest aquarium heaters they have. Put two in each one, set them at 74 degrees and let them run.
[03:28:22.310 --> 03:28:24.870]  Did you get the glass ones or like the stainless steels?
[03:28:24.870 --> 03:28:27.510]  The glass ones. They work beautifully. Then I learned that they sell,
[03:28:28.630 --> 03:28:35.270]  big R sells, they're for heating animal like horse trough tanks. Yeah. Stock tank heaters.
[03:28:35.270 --> 03:28:39.190]  Those would have been more economical, but I didn't think of that because I'm not a farm boy.
[03:28:39.190 --> 03:28:40.230]  I just never thought of that.
[03:28:41.030 --> 03:28:46.870]  I ordered in a couple at the store last winter. We've been selling the glass ones and I found the
[03:28:46.870 --> 03:28:50.790]  stainless steel ones and they sold them up very quickly.
[03:28:51.670 --> 03:28:54.630]  Yeah. I'm afraid that glass one's going to break and they're on accident somehow.
[03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:58.230]  It's in thousand gallons. It's in 250 gallons of water.
[03:28:59.190 --> 03:29:03.830]  Someday it will, but yeah, they fell safe though. So you're not going to get shocked.
[03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:07.910]  Right. Yeah. They're not in there right now. So it's summertime. So I took those motherfuckers
[03:29:07.910 --> 03:29:13.030]  out. But yeah, you guys, a lot of the shit you're going to go spend money on at the hydro store,
[03:29:13.030 --> 03:29:16.790]  go check out the aquarium store before you do that because it's cheaper.
[03:29:16.790 --> 03:29:21.350]  Or even Granger to be totally honest. Oh yeah. You don't always have to buy all your stuff.
[03:29:21.350 --> 03:29:26.390]  Big R has a lot of very useful shit. The normal growth store, not the hydroponic store, but like
[03:29:26.390 --> 03:29:31.830]  the local garden supply center has a lot of shit. Home Depot and Lowe's and Target have a lot of
[03:29:31.910 --> 03:29:37.910]  good shit. Just do not buy nutrients, soil, anything that is going to be consumed by you
[03:29:37.910 --> 03:29:42.230]  or your plant. Don't purchase that at Home Depot, Lowe's or Target. Only accessories made out of
[03:29:42.230 --> 03:29:47.270]  plastic or whatever. That kind of shit. Lighting. That's kind of a growth store
[03:29:47.270 --> 03:29:52.790]  specific still at this point. Hobby Lobby sells Fiskars scissors for $12.99 as opposed to Home
[03:29:52.790 --> 03:29:58.710]  Depot and everywhere else is $19.99. A little titanium tip Fiskars trim scissors.
[03:29:59.430 --> 03:30:06.470]  I think I do them cheaper than that, but I'm not sure. Okay. Oh, at Hygro? Yeah. If they're $9.99,
[03:30:06.470 --> 03:30:13.030]  we'll go get them. One love. Sorry. I guess you guys change names. I can't, I'm not as involved
[03:30:13.030 --> 03:30:17.910]  with the store anymore as I was. Is that the wife now? Oh yeah. It's always been the wife.
[03:30:17.910 --> 03:30:25.110]  Shout out to the wife. Yeah. That's her baby. Nice. She does a good job. I'm just in Springs.
[03:30:25.750 --> 03:30:29.910]  If I were there, I'd shop there, but I'm right up the street from the store in Springs that has,
[03:30:30.470 --> 03:30:35.670]  if I needed 14 bags of soil, I don't know that you'd have it. Nowadays we probably would.
[03:30:36.310 --> 03:30:41.590]  Yeah. No, I understand. Yeah. Trust me. Commercial orders are a little, that's something we should
[03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:46.070]  mention. Commercial ordering. Yeah. Good luck. The first time you want to figure out how much
[03:30:46.070 --> 03:30:49.910]  fucking soil you need to fill all those pots. Cause it's, that's a math challenge. You heard
[03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:53.270]  Jesse and I sit here and try to figure out how much soil we needed. You're going to have to go
[03:30:53.270 --> 03:30:58.710]  back to the store a couple of times. Don't expect all stores. You're going to be able to get
[03:30:58.710 --> 03:31:03.830]  commercial quantities of things when you need them. You need to think ahead about stuff.
[03:31:03.830 --> 03:31:08.790]  Yeah. You might have to start letting, we let the store near us know that this is,
[03:31:08.790 --> 03:31:12.550]  these are products that we use on the regular. If you keep these stocked, we'll buy them.
[03:31:12.550 --> 03:31:16.230]  If we come here and you don't have it, we will drive directly to another store and get it.
[03:31:18.070 --> 03:31:21.830]  And so it took them a couple of rhythms, you know, it took them a couple, Hey, you don't have it.
[03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:25.830]  And like, it's coming Wednesday. The trucks come Wednesday. I don't care. And so we, we kind of,
[03:31:26.470 --> 03:31:31.350]  we compromise with the, we can't fuck with the day the trucks run. Like that's some shit we can't
[03:31:31.350 --> 03:31:35.590]  ask for. Like, we'll get it on your next order. It doesn't fit. Like, you know, like bringing on
[03:31:35.590 --> 03:31:39.430]  the previous order, you guys are ordering a truckload of shit. Like it's a truck of your
[03:31:39.430 --> 03:31:45.670]  stuff. It's funny. The, uh, there's two main truckers that they literally move. I would say
[03:31:45.990 --> 03:31:51.990]  70, 60 to 70% of the gross stores or gross supplies sold in gross stores all across Colorado
[03:31:51.990 --> 03:31:56.070]  are all open down the front range. That's awesome. Gary and James,
[03:31:56.070 --> 03:31:59.510]  because there's probably one warehouse that gets fucking everything. There's three main
[03:31:59.510 --> 03:32:04.070]  warehouses and then it just gets distributed from there out to Pueblo Springs, Denver,
[03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:08.950]  a company named Denver air is one of the only delivery companies that will work from Denver
[03:32:08.950 --> 03:32:13.670]  south on a daily route. Oh, wow. They go to way to grow. They go to, they go to,
[03:32:13.670 --> 03:32:18.790]  they go to grow generation. They go to all of them. All of them. Yeah. Way to grow is my favorite.
[03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:22.070]  If you're going big, you're going big stuff. If you're in Pueblo and you want to buy stuff for
[03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:27.830]  your small growth, definitely hit one love. And if, if you're big, huge, gigantic County,
[03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:34.630]  a greenhouse grow, um, we already deal with a handful of half a dozen clients out there. We
[03:32:34.630 --> 03:32:38.470]  know what it takes to, to service big girls. So if you're in Pueblo and you're out there in the
[03:32:38.470 --> 03:32:41.510]  County, go hit them up. I didn't know if they were in Pueblo or not. I didn't know if they
[03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:44.950]  were in the County, go hit them up. I didn't know if they were able to handle that. Go see,
[03:32:44.950 --> 03:32:49.110]  they'll take care of you. They'll get you a commercial account going drop shipping. Yeah.
[03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:56.230]  You just have to send my pull up to your farm, drop off loads of soil. Oh yeah. It's nice. It's
[03:32:56.230 --> 03:33:00.710]  so much fun watching people carry all your shit in for you. Uh, like Jesse said, he said to hire
[03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:04.950]  somebody that knows what the fuck they're talking about when it comes to working with your engineer
[03:33:04.950 --> 03:33:09.510]  to build the grow something super important that just sounds egotistical coming from myself and
[03:33:09.510 --> 03:33:14.470]  Jesse, but also hire a master grower that is a master grower. Uh, interview people,
[03:33:15.110 --> 03:33:21.510]  look at pictures of plants they've grown. I brought people to my home grow to show them
[03:33:21.510 --> 03:33:25.750]  that I can grow on a commercial scale. I was like, here is what I can do. If you put me in a big grow,
[03:33:25.750 --> 03:33:29.510]  I can do it. And they trusted me and they gave me the opportunity by seeing the cleanliness
[03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:34.630]  and the organization of my home grow. I did the same thing. Yeah. So if you can go look at their
[03:33:34.630 --> 03:33:38.550]  grow before you hire a master grower, do it. And if you're the business guy and you think you're
[03:33:38.550 --> 03:33:42.070]  going to grow it yourself and be professional, you're going to fuck it up. I've got faith in
[03:33:42.070 --> 03:33:45.910]  your skills. I've got faith in your mind, but cannabis is something that takes a lot of practice
[03:33:45.910 --> 03:33:50.070]  to learn. It's like playing an instrument. Uh, you might have natural skill, but you're not going
[03:33:50.070 --> 03:33:53.510]  to be Bon Jovi. The first time you grow, you're going to have to fucking practice. You're going
[03:33:53.510 --> 03:33:57.510]  to have to tour a few times. You're going to have to do it. You're going to have to have 10 cycles
[03:33:57.510 --> 03:34:04.710]  under your belt before you even think about going big, full cycles from clone all the way to drying
[03:34:04.790 --> 03:34:08.150]  and curing all the way to moving the packs. Like there's a lot to figure out.
[03:34:09.430 --> 03:34:14.550]  My boss gets, or my, my head owner, he gets down and dirty in the grow room. It's,
[03:34:15.270 --> 03:34:21.990]  it's, and he's, he has this like child, like excitement about it. It's so fucking awesome.
[03:34:21.990 --> 03:34:26.070]  I've never, I, well, I know hunt, he gets down in the room too.
[03:34:26.070 --> 03:34:31.190]  Hunt packs lots for me. I'll show, hunt comes in at six in the morning on a certain, on Tuesdays,
[03:34:31.270 --> 03:34:35.270]  we'll be there at six in the morning and I'll come in a couple of few hours later and he'll
[03:34:35.270 --> 03:34:38.710]  have a hundred pots filled with soil being like, Hey, you can get all those transplants done today.
[03:34:38.710 --> 03:34:44.230]  I got you a headstart. And I'm like, hell yeah, bro. And he sweeps, he sweeps the entire facility
[03:34:44.230 --> 03:34:49.350]  if I need him to. So does my guy takes out trash. Like he's like, bro, you're not here to take out
[03:34:49.350 --> 03:34:53.430]  trash. You're here to grow cannabis, go grow cannabis for me. It's below your pay grade.
[03:34:55.110 --> 03:34:58.550]  Yeah. That doesn't feel fair. Like I'm not too good to clean the shitters and take out trash,
[03:34:58.550 --> 03:35:00.470]  but you're right. I should be hands-on with a plant.
[03:35:00.470 --> 03:35:06.390]  It feels good though, to have, to work for people that realize you don't want to do that stuff,
[03:35:06.390 --> 03:35:11.590]  that you would do it, but you don't want to. And it feels good for them to, you know,
[03:35:11.590 --> 03:35:14.710]  tell them that you don't have to worry about that. I enjoy that part of it.
[03:35:14.710 --> 03:35:20.310]  A lot of the time I get the giant facility all to myself. So I just put on headphones and yeah,
[03:35:20.310 --> 03:35:24.230]  which makes me feel like sometimes I got to clean the shitters. I got to sweep the floors. I don't
[03:35:24.230 --> 03:35:27.590]  mind doing it for sure. And if I go take a shit, I clean the shitter when I'm done.
[03:35:29.510 --> 03:35:31.830]  Leaving a hot seat and some streaks for the next guy.
[03:35:31.830 --> 03:35:33.990]  That's like rinsing your plate as soon as you're done eating.
[03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:39.270]  Fucking some Windex right there. Just hose that bitch down and clean it up.
[03:35:39.270 --> 03:35:44.070]  For people that don't know much about the industry or don't live in Colorado, it is
[03:35:44.630 --> 03:35:49.270]  not common at all to find owners that are actually involved in the grow.
[03:35:49.270 --> 03:35:51.830]  And that's, I think me and Jeff are both fortunate to work for people.
[03:35:51.830 --> 03:35:56.230]  Unfortunately, it's equally as common to find rich dudes that own Porsche dealerships and want
[03:35:56.230 --> 03:35:59.510]  to double their fucking money by opening a dispensary and being a dickhead to everybody
[03:35:59.510 --> 03:36:02.310]  and don't know anything about cannabis. Oh yeah. There's a few of those.
[03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:07.910]  We're very similar stories. Very similar guys that just want to double up because they
[03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:13.030]  have a little bit of money. So they, so, and that's where my talk about hire a real master
[03:36:13.030 --> 03:36:16.870]  grower loops around. A lot of people want to hire their cousin because they want to give their
[03:36:16.870 --> 03:36:22.470]  cousin a job or their nephew or their fucking brother-in-law because he grew weed in the 70s.
[03:36:22.470 --> 03:36:23.830]  And he talks a good game.
[03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:28.710]  This is your investment. It's going to cost you a million bucks to get your,
[03:36:28.710 --> 03:36:34.790]  your grow and your dispensary going. It's 600,000 for, to get started. And then you need
[03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:39.910]  like another 400 for some payroll and whatever pops up and you're going to need a lawyer and
[03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:44.550]  an accountant. It's a million bucks. Basically a million dollars. Yeah. Just for a small,
[03:36:44.550 --> 03:36:50.310]  small facility. Our little facility, man. Yeah. So unless you trust your fucking cousin,
[03:36:50.310 --> 03:36:54.230]  a million bucks worth, your future is on the line. Your business is on the line. Your grows
[03:36:54.230 --> 03:37:00.470]  on the line. Some of us growers are weird people. We've been taught to hide this for so many years.
[03:37:00.470 --> 03:37:04.470]  The guys that are good at it did it like when we were hiding it and we were kind of sketchy
[03:37:04.470 --> 03:37:09.510]  about it. So sometimes some of our background history on the application is a little vague.
[03:37:10.470 --> 03:37:14.790]  Sometimes we've got a big furry ass beard. They could have squirrels hiding in it. Sometimes you
[03:37:14.790 --> 03:37:19.190]  got dreadlocks down to your ass. They could have the whole damn zoo hiding in it. They don't,
[03:37:19.190 --> 03:37:25.190]  we don't like sharing secrets. We don't like to share too many secrets. We've been fucked over
[03:37:25.190 --> 03:37:30.230]  before. It's so hard by dispensary owners, by street people, by friends, by family,
[03:37:30.230 --> 03:37:34.310]  things have gone wrong. So we're a little, we're a little protective of ourselves and our knowledge.
[03:37:35.910 --> 03:37:42.390]  And it's one thing I heard my boss say the other day, growers are some of the only people in the
[03:37:42.390 --> 03:37:46.950]  industry that don't actually need a job. Right. They could go make their own money doing their...
[03:37:47.670 --> 03:37:53.430]  I hate to say this, but I actually made more money being a black market grower than I ever
[03:37:53.430 --> 03:37:57.750]  have in the legal industry. But I don't have to look over my shoulder anymore. I don't have to,
[03:37:58.390 --> 03:38:02.710]  when I hear ruffling outside the front door too early, I don't think the door is about to get
[03:38:02.710 --> 03:38:07.030]  kicked the fuck in because I spent plenty of years of my life just wondering is today the day they
[03:38:07.030 --> 03:38:11.750]  kick this fucker in? You can get a loan for a car. You can get a loan for it. It's hard work, but
[03:38:13.030 --> 03:38:16.470]  it can get done. Brand new car in the driveway that I couldn't have done when I was a street
[03:38:16.470 --> 03:38:21.110]  hustler because now I've got paychecks and pay stubs and I pay taxes and yeah, I pay child
[03:38:21.110 --> 03:38:24.230]  support because I've got a child that lives with their mom. And just because we don't live in the
[03:38:24.230 --> 03:38:27.910]  same place, I'm required to fucking pay child support, which is cool with me. Instead of just
[03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:31.750]  driving it over there, I have to go through a system which documents it being paid. They were
[03:38:31.750 --> 03:38:35.190]  always on my ass about my income. You're paying child support, but we want to know where your
[03:38:35.190 --> 03:38:38.310]  money comes from. And I was like, why does it matter if the bill gets paid? Yeah. I just kept
[03:38:38.310 --> 03:38:42.390]  telling him like, my mom pays it or my grandpa died. He left me money. I just fucking told him
[03:38:42.390 --> 03:38:46.230]  that kind of shit. But now I'm like, Hey, look, I work at this place. I'm like, okay, thank you.
[03:38:47.030 --> 03:38:50.470]  So having a job, not looking over my shoulder is well worth the difference.
[03:38:50.470 --> 03:38:55.750]  The stress reduction, although there's other stress that comes from it,
[03:38:55.750 --> 03:39:03.750]  right. A different kind of stress. But now I can be, I am more proud of my growth now
[03:39:03.750 --> 03:39:08.070]  than I was when I was a black market. Like it was kind of cool having that thing in the basement
[03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:12.230]  that nobody knew about. And why would disappear for fucking 12 hours at a time? Where have you
[03:39:12.630 --> 03:39:16.470]  been doing? I've been trimming weed, but I can't tell you guys that. Don't worry about it. Yeah.
[03:39:16.470 --> 03:39:21.750]  I don't know. I didn't feel good. I just went home and took a nap. So hire yourself a master
[03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:26.710]  grower. We may look like weirdos. We might be tatted up. Get yourself somebody that's on fucking
[03:39:26.710 --> 03:39:31.590]  time. Somebody that doesn't, they can drink and do some drugs, but I've had some problems in the
[03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:36.310]  past with employees that have recently hired that one guy was a party too hard the night before and
[03:39:36.310 --> 03:39:40.630]  was too drunk to come to work. And then I had another guy that, uh, ate too many mushrooms
[03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:43.590]  the night before and tripped way too hard and had a headache and couldn't come to work.
[03:39:43.590 --> 03:39:48.310]  Plants don't care about that. Yeah. Fuck you. You got a job to do. I rely on you. The plants
[03:39:48.310 --> 03:39:53.030]  rely on you. If you don't show up in water, those plants they're dead. It's a business. Yeah. If,
[03:39:53.830 --> 03:39:56.630]  if you don't show up on time and a pump died overnight because pumps die,
[03:39:57.750 --> 03:40:01.590]  you're fired. The whole garden's dead. You're fucking fired. There goes your million dollar
[03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:05.190]  investment. So hire yourself a real master grower. Somebody that knows what they're doing. Not just
[03:40:05.190 --> 03:40:09.350]  your cousin. We might look like weirdos. We might be introverts, but if we're on time,
[03:40:09.350 --> 03:40:13.270]  we show initiative or dedicated, you got to be a soldier. You got to be dedicated to the grow.
[03:40:13.270 --> 03:40:16.630]  You got to respect the plants. You got to be able to build a relationship with the plants. You need
[03:40:16.630 --> 03:40:20.390]  somebody you can communicate with someone that can multitask, someone that can deal with a
[03:40:20.390 --> 03:40:23.910]  contractor. Someone that's not going to be a dick when the electrician shows up.
[03:40:23.910 --> 03:40:26.390]  Someone that's not going to run out the back door and shows up.
[03:40:29.190 --> 03:40:32.870]  You hand them all the compliance binders with all your info and you tell them to have a good day
[03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:36.070]  and they get to sit there and figure out what's wrong and they can't come in and check until
[03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:40.390]  they tell you they need to. Yeah. Yeah. Just hand them those compliance binders and wait for
[03:40:40.390 --> 03:40:45.350]  them to find an issue. Yeah. There you go. I'm going to go back to work. And by the way, I'm not
[03:40:45.350 --> 03:40:49.990]  the owner, so you can't even tell me shit. I'll call the owner. Call the owner. Don't name meds
[03:40:49.990 --> 03:40:55.350]  here. I'm doing my job. Just go back to work. Nice. Nice. Yeah. All right. I feel like we've
[03:40:55.350 --> 03:40:59.510]  gone a long way in this podcast. That's cool. We're an hour and 15 minutes in, but there's a
[03:40:59.510 --> 03:41:03.510]  lot of good information. This con this podcast was everything. There was a news education and
[03:41:03.510 --> 03:41:10.470]  conversation. I'm not sure what the news was. Terps. Terps. Yeah. The terps are awesome. That's
[03:41:10.470 --> 03:41:14.790]  the news. It's officially you guys. Terps are awesome. Terps on terps. Terps all day long.
[03:41:14.790 --> 03:41:20.390]  Shout out to the terp suite and all those kids. I've got one more thing written down in my paper
[03:41:20.390 --> 03:41:23.990]  of notes that we need to talk about. And it is the Uncle Bud Company. Tell me all about the
[03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:30.390]  Uncle Bud Company. Uncle Bud Company is the company I'm employed by. Is that a grow and
[03:41:30.470 --> 03:41:36.630]  dispensary? Yes. We've got an MIP and an OPC. That's a MIP is a license to make cash and edibles.
[03:41:36.630 --> 03:41:40.150]  Medically infused products. Yes. Marijuana infused products.
[03:41:41.990 --> 03:41:50.550]  We use a CO2 extraction method. So that's primarily we make bait or what we started off.
[03:41:50.550 --> 03:41:57.590]  It's the company's still new. We're evolving. We started off with CO2 oil,
[03:41:58.550 --> 03:42:04.150]  bait, and refills and cartridges. We're bringing out a line of edibles.
[03:42:05.430 --> 03:42:09.590]  We're going through testing and approval, which is a bit of a process right now, but
[03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:16.470]  those will be on store shelves soon. And then we'll also be bringing a, I don't know how I can
[03:42:16.470 --> 03:42:21.670]  state it. We're bringing a fractional distillate product that's similar to a product called clear
[03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:27.190]  to the market. And then we'll be bringing our version of terpenes to the rec market.
[03:42:27.350 --> 03:42:31.910]  Distillate is the new stuff. Let me read the label on the distillate that I've got. This is
[03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:40.710]  raw distillate. This is total potential cannabinoids, 94.1% THC cannabinoids total.
[03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:49.110]  And then it's broken down CBD 1.1%, THC 90.94% THC in this distillate.
[03:42:49.110 --> 03:42:53.190]  And it's just like that. Yeah. It's basically the same thing. You're just taking
[03:42:53.190 --> 03:42:56.710]  RotoVap and everything and pulling out the terpenoids, pulling out the cannabinoids and
[03:42:56.710 --> 03:43:01.270]  making them into separate products. There's a, yeah, there's another process in there.
[03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:05.670]  Yeah. We won't cover all of that stuff. It involves something named after a farm animal.
[03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:12.390]  All right. That was really vague. So you said that you had edibles being tested and that would
[03:43:12.390 --> 03:43:16.230]  be coming out in the market. Are those only going to be available at the Uncle Bud company, or are
[03:43:16.230 --> 03:43:21.270]  those going to be available at recreational and or medical shops statewide? We are a wholesaler.
[03:43:21.270 --> 03:43:25.110]  We don't have a storefront. I like it. I like it. It's so much easier that way.
[03:43:25.190 --> 03:43:31.990]  Yes. Our CO2 oil right now, I know here in Pueblo it's available at the spot. It's also
[03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:36.310]  available at the spot in Trinidad. Your CO2 oil that you guys made?
[03:43:36.310 --> 03:43:39.110]  Yes. Okay, cool. So it's a recreational product.
[03:43:39.110 --> 03:43:40.390]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Sorry. Yeah.
[03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:48.950]  The edible products we're coming up with at the moment, we've got a barbecue sauce that's going
[03:43:48.950 --> 03:43:52.230]  through the proving process. No shit. Barbecue sauce?
[03:43:52.230 --> 03:43:56.390]  Yep. Hey, the people that own my company are from Georgia and Texas.
[03:43:56.390 --> 03:43:59.350]  Some people are going to be high as fuck. This barbecue sauce is good.
[03:43:59.350 --> 03:44:01.990]  Oh, dude. It's so good. It's really good.
[03:44:03.270 --> 03:44:07.910]  How many milligrams of THC per serving? That's part of the thing we're figuring out
[03:44:07.910 --> 03:44:13.510]  right now. But a bottle, it's got to be limited at 100 milligrams. So it's going to be a smaller
[03:44:13.510 --> 03:44:18.630]  bottle. But I think it'll be like two servings. So 50 milligrams a serving.
[03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:21.750]  All right. So if you're going to make some ribs, you can just squirt the whole bottle across some
[03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:25.110]  ribs. Is the heat when you're cooking the ribs going to fuck up my medicine?
[03:44:25.110 --> 03:44:26.790]  That's one of the things we've got to figure out.
[03:44:26.790 --> 03:44:30.230]  All right. So yeah, there's a whole... I had no idea.
[03:44:30.230 --> 03:44:33.430]  I'm a vegetarian, you guys. So I'm just hypothetically talking about barbecue ribs over
[03:44:33.430 --> 03:44:38.950]  here. I had no idea of the proving process the state requires for a new style edible.
[03:44:38.950 --> 03:44:41.430]  It's rigorous. And then we're doing popcorn balls too.
[03:44:41.430 --> 03:44:45.910]  Oh yeah. Popcorn balls are huge. I had some popcorn balls that were coated and clear.
[03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:47.830]  Oh, nice. Oh, dude. That was high.
[03:44:48.550 --> 03:44:53.750]  That's a part of the... A lot of our demand we've been getting for clear right now is coming from
[03:44:53.750 --> 03:44:56.870]  edibles manufacturers. Because they don't want any smell or any taste.
[03:44:56.870 --> 03:45:00.550]  Right. It makes it so much easier. And it's more viscous. It's easier to work with. It's
[03:45:00.550 --> 03:45:05.430]  not chunky like BHO. It's a higher percentage. So it's easier to work with. It's easier to
[03:45:05.430 --> 03:45:06.790]  redo the math and everything. Less goes further. Yeah.
[03:45:07.430 --> 03:45:13.750]  I shout out to my friends at TNT Extractions. They gave me a 1000 milligram chocolate bar.
[03:45:14.710 --> 03:45:18.950]  It was kind of like biting into... They told me that there's a gram and a half of shatter
[03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:23.590]  melted into that chocolate bar. It tasted like they just took a gram and a half of shatter
[03:45:23.590 --> 03:45:27.670]  into a chocolate bar and just dropped the shatter directly into the chocolate bar.
[03:45:27.670 --> 03:45:31.430]  Because when I bit into it, it was chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, hash.
[03:45:34.230 --> 03:45:38.550]  And I had to chew through the hash. Just like, okay, chocolate again, chocolate, chocolate,
[03:45:38.550 --> 03:45:43.350]  chocolate. But the hash was like my teeth. You know when you take a dab and your lips get sticky?
[03:45:43.350 --> 03:45:46.630]  My teeth were like, they're making this noise when I pull them apart. They'd sound like...
[03:45:47.430 --> 03:45:52.950]  When I pulled them apart, they would do that. I was like, damn, I'm hashy. I got so high that
[03:45:53.670 --> 03:45:57.270]  I made a list of things to do because I went to work. I ate it and went to fucking work.
[03:45:57.270 --> 03:46:00.630]  Bad idea. I made a list of shit to do. And I would read on the list,
[03:46:00.630 --> 03:46:04.390]  water plants. And I'd walk to the water and turn on the hose and be like,
[03:46:04.390 --> 03:46:08.710]  what was I about to do? Was I going to water some plants? I'm not sure what was about to happen.
[03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:12.710]  But I haven't eaten any edibles since that day. I've been a little bit leery of edibles.
[03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:15.750]  I had an incident a few weeks ago. I heard some action at the front door.
[03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:19.190]  So let's wrap up this podcast, bro. I appreciate you for coming and doing an hour and 20 minute
[03:46:19.190 --> 03:46:22.950]  podcast with me. That's awesome of you. Thanks to Byrne for letting me borrow your husband for an
[03:46:22.950 --> 03:46:25.910]  hour and a half and taking some dabs with me. That's super cool. Shout out to the Uncle Bud
[03:46:25.910 --> 03:46:30.070]  company. Hey guys, I'm going to wrap up this podcast. Thank you for coming, Jesse. Make sure
[03:46:30.070 --> 03:46:34.150]  you check out Jesse Grows on Instagram. Yeah. Oh, did she make it in? She made it in. We don't
[03:46:34.150 --> 03:46:39.030]  have to go so quickly. There's food here. I like that. Thanks for coming, bro. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks
[03:46:39.030 --> 03:46:41.990]  for having me. For sure. You had something, one more thing to say, throw it out there.
[03:46:41.990 --> 03:46:46.230]  Colorado podcast.com. Make sure you check it out. Stitcher and SoundCloud too. We're going to get
[03:46:46.230 --> 03:46:51.030]  you on iTunes. Do you know how to do that? I just haven't had the time to sit down and-
[03:46:51.030 --> 03:46:54.150]  I know how to do it. Nice. Nice. If you need help, I will get you on there. Sweet. We're
[03:46:54.150 --> 03:46:57.830]  going to get this podcast on iTunes because iTunes is the place most people listen. Stitcher is
[03:46:57.830 --> 03:47:02.390]  number two. iTunes is number one. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, you'll really see your comments and shit
[03:47:02.390 --> 03:47:06.070]  will come in on iTunes. At least we're not just stuck on SoundCloud now, which is like probably
[03:47:06.070 --> 03:47:10.630]  number 12 or 14. Yeah. And I can't listen. I don't even have SoundCloud on my phone. So I'd
[03:47:10.630 --> 03:47:15.510]  have to go through your Facebook post and then use the link. And then it was just a pain in the
[03:47:15.510 --> 03:47:19.190]  ass. And then if I get a call, then I have to start the episode over and that sucked. I hate that.
[03:47:19.190 --> 03:47:25.670]  Yeah. That's the only thing I use SoundCloud for is just to check our show. So that's as soon as
[03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:31.030]  we're on stage. Have you played with your statistics yet? Your metrics on Stitcher?
[03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:35.270]  No, I haven't. Don't get too attached to it, but it's fun to go look and see what your ranking is
[03:47:35.270 --> 03:47:39.190]  and shit. I love doing it. The first night I kind of looked at it, but it didn't have any info.
[03:47:39.190 --> 03:47:43.590]  Oh, you need to go at least like 60 days or something. Yeah. Word. Well, dude, thanks for
[03:47:43.590 --> 03:47:49.030]  coming. Yeah. Thanks for having me. Big shout out to 44 and Despicable D. Yes, sir. We'll get you
[03:47:49.030 --> 03:47:52.390]  guys on next time. Next time I'm going to come be on your show. I'll just be at your shows.
[03:47:52.390 --> 03:47:58.470]  I will do it. Fuckers. Your podcast D. Also shout out to Fetus. I've never, I don't think I've ever
[03:47:58.470 --> 03:48:03.110]  met Fetus, but I hear a lot about the dude. So he's a weirdo. His name's fucking Fetus.
[03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:08.470]  Of course he's a weirdo. All right, you guys, I'm going to let Jesse go home. We're going to take a
[03:48:08.470 --> 03:48:14.070]  couple of dabs and I will be back to put a bow on this bitch. Nice. See you guys later.
