[01:47.800 --> 01:48.800]  All right.
[01:48.800 --> 01:50.200]  I don't have a lot of stuff to ramble about.
[01:50.200 --> 01:54.160]  I do want to mention that I think I have answered all of the Patreon questions.
[01:54.160 --> 01:57.320]  If you have sent me a Patreon question, I think I've done my best to either print it

[02:03.680 --> 02:05.080]  I will get your questions on the show.
[02:05.080 --> 02:06.080]  I went through the other day.
[02:06.080 --> 02:07.080]  I printed them all out.
[02:07.080 --> 02:09.240]  I think I'm caught up and or catching up.
[02:09.240 --> 02:13.080]  Unless you've sent it in the past couple of days, it should be in this pile of printed
[02:13.080 --> 02:15.520]  messages or it should be done already.

[02:18.000 --> 02:22.160]  Also don't forget about that grow help tab on the website at iReedGenetics.com.
[02:22.160 --> 02:24.040]  There's a tab there that says grow help.
[02:24.040 --> 02:25.040]  Click on there.
[02:25.040 --> 02:26.920]  I will help you answer all of your grow questions.
[02:26.920 --> 02:27.920]  All right.
[02:27.920 --> 02:29.720]  I said I wasn't going to ramble too much.
[02:29.720 --> 02:32.840]  Let's talk about the main topic of today's podcast.
[02:32.840 --> 02:35.520]  Let me let you know how I got to this point of the podcast.
[02:35.520 --> 02:39.760]  I have been maybe co-parenting, maybe pupsitting some dogs.
[02:39.760 --> 02:41.240]  I've got two wonderful dogs hanging out.
[02:41.240 --> 02:43.120]  I can see them just behind the cameras.
[02:43.120 --> 02:46.480]  They're chewing on some bones, keeping themselves entertained for a while.
[02:46.480 --> 02:50.700]  It brought me up a bunch of great stuff to talk about for the podcast here.
[02:50.700 --> 02:54.840]  My first question is do you take your dogs into the grow space?
[02:54.840 --> 02:56.120]  That's my big question.
[02:56.120 --> 02:59.280]  I prefer not to have the dogs in the grow.
[02:59.280 --> 03:03.280]  I was operating in a lot of commercial environments, a lot of large grows.
[03:03.280 --> 03:06.200]  My grow is a large part of my livelihood.
[03:06.200 --> 03:10.600]  Taking a dog in there, I don't have any fear that these dogs are going to damage the plants,
[03:10.600 --> 03:11.600]  any equipment.
[03:11.600 --> 03:12.680]  They're not going to get into anything.
[03:12.680 --> 03:14.500]  They're pretty good dogs.
[03:14.500 --> 03:18.080]  What about all of the pests, the things that are in all of their fur?
[03:18.080 --> 03:21.920]  I'm not saying those dogs are dirty, but we went for a walk today and I watched one dog
[03:21.920 --> 03:25.680]  run through the lawn, the other one rubbed up against a couple of bushes.
[03:25.680 --> 03:26.680]  We go on hikes.
[03:26.680 --> 03:27.680]  We go out in the woods.
[03:27.680 --> 03:28.680]  We go out in the desert.
[03:28.680 --> 03:29.680]  We go out in the trees.
[03:29.680 --> 03:30.680]  We go everywhere.
[03:30.680 --> 03:32.200]  These dogs are gathering all sorts of things.
[03:32.200 --> 03:33.960]  Do we bring our dogs in the grow rooms?
[03:33.960 --> 03:38.280]  Because if we do, I fear we are spreading those, whatever they gathered into the grow
[03:38.280 --> 03:39.280]  room.
[03:39.280 --> 03:44.720]  But also, then I think about it, am I bringing that in just on my pants, on my shoes, in
[03:44.720 --> 03:45.720]  my dreadlocks?
[03:45.720 --> 03:46.720]  I know it's disgusting.
[03:46.720 --> 03:49.920]  I could have whatever the dogs walked across, they snuggled up against me.
[03:49.920 --> 03:50.920]  It's on my pants.
[03:50.920 --> 03:51.920]  It's on my clothes.
[03:51.920 --> 03:52.920]  It's on your clothes, on your pants.
[03:52.920 --> 03:55.920]  Do I just happen to have dreadlocks down to my ankles?
[03:55.920 --> 03:56.920]  Calves maybe.
[03:56.920 --> 03:57.920]  I'm exaggerating.
[03:57.920 --> 03:58.920]  They do hit the calves.
[03:58.920 --> 03:59.920]  I got dreads at least past the knees.
[03:59.920 --> 04:02.440]  So I've got a lot of opportunity to gather things.
[04:02.440 --> 04:03.680]  So am I any worse than the dogs?
[04:03.680 --> 04:05.120]  Are the dogs any worse than me?
[04:05.120 --> 04:09.240]  That was something I was thinking about today on a very stoned dog walk, which we will talk
[04:09.240 --> 04:11.080]  about a little bit later.
[04:11.080 --> 04:16.280]  But anything that ends up on that dog is going to end up on your shoes, your clothes, your
[04:16.280 --> 04:21.440]  pants, your T-shirt, your dreadlocks, your arms, your car seat, your couch.
[04:21.440 --> 04:24.920]  If you're out in the woods or out at the forest or out at a hike, wherever you may take the
[04:24.920 --> 04:25.920]  dogs.
[04:25.920 --> 04:26.920]  And I said hike.
[04:26.920 --> 04:27.920]  I apologize if you caught that both times.
[04:27.920 --> 04:31.280]  But if you're out there with the dogs, whatever you get on you, if it's a tick, if it's a
[04:31.280 --> 04:34.720]  spider mite, if it's a fungus gnat, whatever you could, if it's a fucking tree spider,
[04:34.720 --> 04:39.560]  if it's a wood spider, a wolf spider, a brown recluse, a black widow, a cobra.
[04:39.560 --> 04:40.560]  I'm exaggerating here.
[04:40.560 --> 04:43.480]  But anything you do pick up, you're going to carry that to the car.
[04:43.480 --> 04:44.480]  It's going to get in the car seat.
[04:44.480 --> 04:45.480]  It's going to get in your clothes.
[04:45.480 --> 04:46.480]  It's going to come to the house.
[04:46.480 --> 04:47.480]  It's going to get in the couch.
[04:47.480 --> 04:49.560]  Are you changing clothes immediately when you get home?
[04:49.560 --> 04:51.760]  Are you vacuuming out the car all the time?
[04:51.760 --> 04:54.880]  So I'm curious about the dogs in the grow space, grow environment.
[04:54.920 --> 04:59.680]  I personally choose not to let the dogs in the grow, but I walked the dogs and then I
[04:59.680 --> 05:02.080]  came in the house and I went and I had to do some things.
[05:02.080 --> 05:04.480]  I had to quickly change clothes and then go to the grow space.
[05:04.480 --> 05:07.840]  And I'm wondering, are there any things that I just introduced to that grow?
[05:07.840 --> 05:08.880]  I love the dogs to death.
[05:08.880 --> 05:12.160]  So it's a kind of a barrier to figure out there.
[05:12.160 --> 05:16.400]  So another thing you have to think about when you have dogs around is all the dog hair in
[05:16.400 --> 05:17.400]  photos.
[05:17.400 --> 05:20.240]  I used to have a dog that lived here with me for several years.
[05:20.240 --> 05:21.840]  She passed away, rest in peace, Jen dog.
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.520]  If you guys remember the old shows back in the day, sometimes you'd hear her footsteps
[05:25.520 --> 05:29.880]  tap across the floor here when we were recording big up to Jen dog, miss you boo.
[05:29.880 --> 05:32.960]  But that dog would get dog fur in the photos.
[05:32.960 --> 05:34.320]  Just the dog fur would end up on me.
[05:34.320 --> 05:36.520]  I'd go take a great cannabis photo.
[05:36.520 --> 05:40.480]  Nine out of 10 times the best photos I ever took would have a little piece of dog fur
[05:40.480 --> 05:41.480]  in there.
[05:41.480 --> 05:43.800]  So ginger would be in the photos all the time.
[05:43.800 --> 05:47.800]  We used to say that you could tell a bag of weed is really good weed and it was grown
[05:47.800 --> 05:48.800]  with love.
[05:48.800 --> 05:51.520]  If there are a couple of dog hairs in your house, that's how you know it's really good
[05:52.200 --> 05:53.920]  So big up to all the growers out there with the dog.
[05:53.920 --> 05:55.960]  I'm just curious, do you take your dog into the grow?
[05:55.960 --> 06:00.760]  Do you feel like your dog is compromising your integrated pest management strategy?
[06:00.760 --> 06:04.960]  Is that something that we need to improve or work on if we do have our dogs around in
[06:04.960 --> 06:06.160]  the outdoor grow?
[06:06.160 --> 06:07.160]  Bring the dog around.
[06:07.160 --> 06:08.160]  The dog works as security.
[06:08.160 --> 06:09.160]  The dog loves the plants.
[06:09.160 --> 06:11.680]  A dog's good companionship and the indoor environment.
[06:11.680 --> 06:15.960]  I may choose not to bring the dog in there, but like I rambled on about, am I just carrying
[06:15.960 --> 06:17.320]  the things I snuggle with the dog?
[06:17.320 --> 06:20.640]  I took touch the dog, scratch on the dog, make silly dog voices.
[06:20.760 --> 06:24.640]  I walk into the house, change clothes, walk into the grow room where the dogs are, where
[06:24.640 --> 06:25.640]  the plants are.
[06:25.640 --> 06:27.640]  I probably didn't clean up well enough.
[06:27.640 --> 06:30.080]  Definitely something in the dreadlocks carried some shit in there.
[06:30.080 --> 06:31.800]  All right, let's see where we are now.
[06:31.800 --> 06:36.660]  The next part of this ramble festival is do your dogs enjoy consuming cannabis?
[06:36.660 --> 06:39.160]  Do your pets enjoy consuming cannabis?
[06:39.160 --> 06:41.400]  These dogs I'm babysitting now are not fully mine.
[06:41.400 --> 06:44.560]  I'm not comfortable blowing any smoke in their direction yet.
[06:44.560 --> 06:47.920]  When I'm given permission by their parents one day, their main parent, their mommy one
[06:47.920 --> 06:49.960]  day, then maybe they may get stoned.
[06:50.280 --> 06:52.440]  But so far at this point, those dogs have not been stoned.
[06:52.440 --> 06:58.000]  I did have pets in the past that some of those pets love to smoke and some of those pets
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.000]  hated to smoke.
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.280]  I mentioned Jen dog a minute ago.
[07:00.280 --> 07:02.240]  Shout out to Ginger the dog.
[07:02.240 --> 07:03.880]  Ginger hated cannabis.
[07:03.880 --> 07:05.600]  She would not, she didn't want to be around the smoke.
[07:05.600 --> 07:06.960]  She didn't like edibles.
[07:06.960 --> 07:08.760]  She did not want anything to do with weed.
[07:08.760 --> 07:13.040]  If it got too smoky in the car, too smoky in the room, she would try to find a way out.
[07:13.040 --> 07:15.080]  You'd have to open a window, give Ginger some air.
[07:15.080 --> 07:19.840]  However, I had some cats back in the day that, yeah, I'm not really a cat guy, but I lived
[07:19.920 --> 07:20.920]  in an apartment.
[07:20.920 --> 07:23.080]  It was kind of a multiple people environment.
[07:23.080 --> 07:25.440]  One of the peoples there had cats.
[07:25.440 --> 07:28.320]  I would smoke weed regularly in that house through a big bong.
[07:28.320 --> 07:30.280]  I had a really cool big bong.
[07:30.280 --> 07:34.280]  Every time I would get out that bong and start breaking up my weed, those cats would just
[07:34.280 --> 07:35.680]  come surround me.
[07:35.680 --> 07:39.680]  They'd start circling me and just meow, meow, meow.
[07:39.680 --> 07:42.680]  And I'd take a big fat bong rip and I wouldn't blow it directly at the cats.
[07:42.680 --> 07:45.920]  I'd blow it kind of at the floor and they would just go bask in that smoke and they
[07:45.920 --> 07:46.920]  would get stoned.
[07:46.920 --> 07:49.180]  And after a couple of bong rips, the cats would leave me alone.
[07:49.180 --> 07:52.420]  So I really think the cats loved to smoke weed with me.
[07:52.420 --> 07:53.420]  They loved to get blazed.
[07:53.420 --> 07:57.220]  Anytime I would roll a joint, bust out the bong, those cats would be like, oh yeah.
[07:57.220 --> 07:59.220]  And they'd just come cruise around and do that.
[07:59.220 --> 08:01.900]  And they rub up against you and they purr and I'd blow them a couple of bong hits and
[08:01.900 --> 08:02.900]  they'd leave me alone.
[08:02.900 --> 08:03.900]  They'd be content.
[08:03.900 --> 08:06.420]  They'd just go do cat shit around the house and be dicks like cats do.
[08:06.420 --> 08:10.140]  However, Ginger dog, if you blew a bong rip at her, she'd growl at you and put her head
[08:10.140 --> 08:13.020]  down and try to hold her breath and be like, dude, why did you just do that to me?
[08:13.020 --> 08:14.020]  You're ruining my life.
[08:14.020 --> 08:16.200]  Gin dog hated bong rips.
[08:16.200 --> 08:21.020]  These dogs, when I turn on the dab torch, they come wherever they are.
[08:21.020 --> 08:23.920]  If I fire up the dab torch, if they're in the living room, if they're trying to go out
[08:23.920 --> 08:25.640]  to the backyard, right now they're chewing up bones.
[08:25.640 --> 08:27.440]  If I fired up the dab torch, they'd come hang out.
[08:27.440 --> 08:32.240]  I think they enjoy either hanging out with me while I dab or they want to get high.
[08:32.240 --> 08:33.240]  I'm not sure yet.
[08:33.240 --> 08:35.600]  Got to ask their mommy for permission and she will tell me no.
[08:35.600 --> 08:38.160]  So they'll never find out if they like smoking.
[08:38.160 --> 08:39.520]  Where am I on the notes?
[08:39.520 --> 08:42.960]  With that being said, I'll never force smoking upon an animal.
[08:42.960 --> 08:47.400]  I'll never give an animal edibles or anything if they don't enjoy it, if they haven't showed
[08:47.400 --> 08:48.400]  any interest in it.
[08:48.400 --> 08:49.520]  I will not do that to a dog.
[08:49.520 --> 08:53.320]  Gin dog ate edibles one time that were, they weren't meant for her to eat.
[08:53.320 --> 08:54.320]  She stole them off a table.
[08:54.320 --> 08:55.320]  I never thought she'd do that.
[08:55.320 --> 08:56.620]  She was a better dog than that at that time.
[08:56.620 --> 08:59.320]  But she stole some edibles and got high.
[08:59.320 --> 09:01.600]  She was too high and she did not enjoy that.
[09:01.600 --> 09:02.880]  She was fucked up for a long time.
[09:02.880 --> 09:05.040]  So after that, I never gave her edibles again.
[09:05.040 --> 09:06.680]  She never wanted to smoke.
[09:06.680 --> 09:08.200]  But I would never force it on an animal.
[09:08.200 --> 09:13.600]  You guys do not force medicate your animals unless maybe if you're giving them like CBD
[09:13.600 --> 09:16.440]  for a medical condition, but if you're just getting them high to be a dick, don't do that.
[09:16.440 --> 09:19.660]  If you're giving, if you're treating them for a medical condition and they're, uh, every
[09:19.660 --> 09:22.960]  animal's resistant to taking medication, they know they'll take it.
[09:22.960 --> 09:23.960]  They'll eat everything.
[09:23.960 --> 09:25.840]  They're not supposed to eat until you try to give them some medicine.
[09:25.840 --> 09:27.000]  I'm like, oh, that's good for me.
[09:27.000 --> 09:28.280]  I shouldn't eat that.
[09:28.280 --> 09:29.280]  That's not rabbit poop.
[09:29.280 --> 09:30.280]  I'm not going to eat that.
[09:30.280 --> 09:31.280]  Yeah.
[09:31.280 --> 09:33.940]  Animals are trippy like that, but let's not force our dogs to get high.
[09:33.940 --> 09:36.200]  That's not cool unless they really enjoy it.
[09:36.200 --> 09:41.400]  Um, something I was going to talk about ginger dog, gin dog, dude, there's nothing I mentioned
[09:41.400 --> 09:44.440]  earlier, those stoned as fuck dog walks.
[09:44.440 --> 09:47.720]  There is nothing like getting ultra blazed.
[09:47.720 --> 09:49.480]  I may allegedly have done this this morning.
[09:49.480 --> 09:54.080]  I may have taken excessive dabs this morning and got these dogs all laced up on their leashes
[09:54.080 --> 09:57.240]  and went for a really nice dog, dog walk.
[09:57.240 --> 10:02.560]  Nothing like getting lit up and going for a long blazed dog walk in the sunshine.
[10:02.560 --> 10:03.560]  Got the dogs just cruising.
[10:03.560 --> 10:04.560]  You got someone to talk to.
[10:04.800 --> 10:07.560]  People probably think I'm crazy because I talked to those dogs like they're fucking humans.
[10:07.560 --> 10:09.280]  There are a couple of my buddies talk to him.
[10:09.280 --> 10:10.920]  They got very unique personalities.
[10:10.920 --> 10:11.920]  We go for a walk in the morning.
[10:11.920 --> 10:13.240]  I get super blazed.
[10:13.240 --> 10:16.960]  A gin dog, my dog ginger back in the day before she passed away.
[10:16.960 --> 10:21.480]  If it was like 10, 10 30, maybe 11 o'clock at night in the spring and the summertime,
[10:21.480 --> 10:24.240]  maybe early fall when it wasn't too cold here in Colorado, it gets cold.
[10:24.240 --> 10:25.760]  So fuck the winter dog walk.
[10:25.760 --> 10:26.760]  That's another story.
[10:26.760 --> 10:28.040]  That's a pain in the ass.
[10:28.040 --> 10:33.200]  But in the nice weather time, if my dog saw me grab the grinder and some papers and a
[10:33.200 --> 10:34.960]  bag of weed, she'd watch me.
[10:34.960 --> 10:36.880]  She'd be like, oh shit, he's rolling a joint.
[10:36.880 --> 10:38.000]  It's like 10 o'clock.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.160]  He's rolling a joint.
[10:39.160 --> 10:41.960]  She'd watch me roll up a joint, roll up a couple of joints and set them on the side
[10:41.960 --> 10:42.960]  of the desk.
[10:42.960 --> 10:47.200]  And if she saw me go get my shoes and shoes and socks, she'd be like, oh shit, we might
[10:47.200 --> 10:48.200]  be time.
[10:48.200 --> 10:49.200]  It might be time.
[10:49.200 --> 10:50.200]  And she'd start wiggling it.
[10:50.200 --> 10:51.200]  See her get all excited.
[10:51.200 --> 10:55.680]  If I grabbed that leash, that dog would know, oh my God, we're going for a 10 o'clock joint
[10:55.680 --> 10:56.680]  walk.
[10:56.680 --> 10:57.880]  It's going to be one of those nights.
[10:57.880 --> 11:00.720]  And we'd just go walk around the neighborhood and smoke a couple of joints and just walk
[11:00.720 --> 11:01.920]  the dog.
[11:01.920 --> 11:06.320]  Nothing about that was just so satisfying, so pleasing, so relaxing.
[11:06.320 --> 11:07.800]  Just cruising the neighborhood with my dog.
[11:07.800 --> 11:10.560]  I feel like I'm just a weird looking dude.
[11:10.560 --> 11:14.520]  I guess I'm a fucking tall white guy with dreadlocks down to my ass and kind of a nicer
[11:14.520 --> 11:15.520]  neighborhood.
[11:15.520 --> 11:18.400]  So walking around late at night here for no reason may look a little bit sketchy.
[11:18.400 --> 11:20.760]  But if I got the dog, you got a really good excuse to be out.
[11:20.760 --> 11:24.520]  I'm just a guy, a hippie guy walking the hippie dog that looks really natural.
[11:24.520 --> 11:26.560]  And who wouldn't expect me to be smoking a joint?
[11:26.560 --> 11:30.000]  If you saw my hippie ass walking with my dog and I wasn't smoking a joint, then you'd think
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.000]  I'm up to something.
[11:31.080 --> 11:32.920]  But smoking a joint lets you know what I'm up to.
[11:32.920 --> 11:34.600]  I'm out walking my dog, smoking a joint.
[11:34.600 --> 11:35.600]  Here comes the dog to say hi.
[11:35.600 --> 11:36.600]  Hi boy.
[11:36.600 --> 11:37.800]  Please don't interrupt the recording.
[11:37.800 --> 11:38.960]  Don't knock anything over.
[11:38.960 --> 11:41.340]  He's going to come sit by me because he heard me talking about him.
[11:41.340 --> 11:43.920]  But going and walking and smoking a couple of joints is great.
[11:43.920 --> 11:46.080]  Nobody cares that I'm out there smoking a couple of joints.
[11:46.080 --> 11:49.960]  And by the time if anybody does say anything, by the time I'm done walking past them, they
[11:49.960 --> 11:50.960]  forgot about it.
[11:50.960 --> 11:53.160]  And then by the time anybody would show up to harass me, the joint would be out.
[11:53.160 --> 11:54.760]  I'm just walking dogs, no problem.
[11:54.760 --> 11:58.560]  So nothing like a nice 10, 30, 11 p.m. dog walk.
[11:58.560 --> 11:59.880]  My dog would get so excited.
[11:59.920 --> 12:02.800]  She'd see me roll those joints, grab my shoes, and she'd just be watching.
[12:02.800 --> 12:03.800]  Is he going to get the leash?
[12:03.800 --> 12:04.800]  Is he going to get the leash?
[12:04.800 --> 12:07.600]  And as soon as I would have the leash in one spot, I would keep it up on top of the fridge
[12:07.600 --> 12:08.600]  just out of the way.
[12:08.600 --> 12:11.160]  If she saw me reach up there, she'd be like, oh God, here we go.
[12:11.160 --> 12:12.640]  And she'd start spinning in circles.
[12:12.640 --> 12:14.840]  She knew that was the coolest shit ever.
[12:14.840 --> 12:18.360]  You guys have been rambling on long enough about walking our dogs and pets.
[12:18.360 --> 12:20.840]  Let me make sure I covered all these notes here.
[12:20.840 --> 12:22.800]  They're carriers of bugs, but we love them so much.
[12:22.800 --> 12:25.040]  So they're worth their bullshit.
[12:25.040 --> 12:26.560]  Those things end up in your clothes and your shoes.
[12:26.760 --> 12:30.000]  Do you change your clothes and your shoes before you go into your grow space, especially
[12:30.000 --> 12:31.200]  after playing with your animals?
[12:31.200 --> 12:33.640]  That may be helping you out.
[12:33.640 --> 12:34.960]  Is there dog hair in your photos?
[12:34.960 --> 12:36.280]  That's how we know you got pets.
[12:36.280 --> 12:40.200]  If there's dog hair in the weed, that's how we know you're growing really good weed.
[12:40.200 --> 12:44.280]  Don't force your pets to consume cannabis unless you're giving them some sort of medication,
[12:44.280 --> 12:48.120]  some sort of medicine, getting them high, especially blowing it in their ear and stuff.
[12:48.120 --> 12:49.120]  That's completely rude.
[12:49.120 --> 12:51.160]  You guys, I got to go take something from the dog.
[12:51.160 --> 12:52.160]  I don't even know what he's got.
[12:52.160 --> 12:53.160]  I'm not even going to edit this out.
[12:53.160 --> 12:54.160]  But hang on.
[12:54.440 --> 12:55.960]  We're going to go get some shit from Rafiki.
[12:55.960 --> 12:56.960]  All right.
[12:56.960 --> 12:59.080]  I am back through the magic of editing.
[12:59.080 --> 13:02.320]  Thanks for hanging out for a minute while I solved some dog problems.
[13:02.320 --> 13:04.000]  That is enough rambling about dogs.
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.000]  Let me know.
[13:05.000 --> 13:06.000]  Tweet me.
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.000]  Send me a message.
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.000]  However, you do want to contact me on Twitter.
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.400]  It is at GFYH podcast.
[13:10.400 --> 13:13.000]  Send me an email or reach out on the grow help tab.
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.000]  Let me know.
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.480]  Do you allow the dogs in your grow space or maybe even send me pictures of your cute dogs?
[13:18.480 --> 13:19.480]  I'm down with that.
[13:19.480 --> 13:21.520]  I'm keeping an eye on this dog because he's fired up.
[13:21.520 --> 13:22.520]  He's feisty.
[13:22.520 --> 13:23.520]  All right.
[13:23.520 --> 13:26.760]  Let's jump into some emails before I've got to wrap up this podcast.
[13:26.760 --> 13:28.980]  This one came from our friend.
[13:28.980 --> 13:32.440]  They want their name said it doesn't even have their name on it.
[13:32.440 --> 13:33.520]  It goes a lot like this.
[13:33.520 --> 13:38.320]  It says, when you think a mother plant needs to be replaced, do you grow them or just ditch
[13:38.320 --> 13:39.320]  them?
[13:39.320 --> 13:40.320]  That's a very good question.
[13:40.320 --> 13:42.360]  This is kind of controversial between Mike and myself.
[13:42.360 --> 13:45.120]  It says I've had bad luck growing them out.
[13:45.120 --> 13:47.060]  Mostly just really low yields.
[13:47.060 --> 13:49.360]  One strain just died two times I tried it.
[13:49.360 --> 13:51.640]  Also, I was listening to your latest episode.
[13:51.640 --> 13:53.680]  Talk of your love of comedy and podcasts.
[13:53.680 --> 13:55.440]  You should try the ice cream social.
[13:55.440 --> 13:57.840]  Then he sent me a link to the ice cream social.
[13:57.840 --> 14:00.120]  I will do my best to remember to check that out.
[14:00.120 --> 14:02.080]  I've got a link so that makes it easy.
[14:02.080 --> 14:05.160]  Thank you big up for being a podcast and a comedy fan.
[14:05.160 --> 14:09.620]  Let's talk a little bit about mother plants and if we should flip them or just toss them
[14:09.620 --> 14:10.620]  and replace them.
[14:10.620 --> 14:15.240]  That's really all about your strategy or needs your wants and your goals.
[14:15.240 --> 14:20.520]  I replace my mother plants about two, maybe three times a year depending on the lights,
[14:20.520 --> 14:24.560]  the plants, the health of the plants, just timing the way shit goes.
[14:24.560 --> 14:28.200]  Every three, maybe every six months-ish, they do need a replacement.
[14:28.200 --> 14:30.240]  I do take a bunch of clones.
[14:30.240 --> 14:35.280]  As soon as I get them potted and rooted, then I cut down the big plants and throw them away.
[14:35.280 --> 14:39.500]  Sometimes they get moved into a flowering room or sometimes they will get taken outdoors
[14:39.500 --> 14:41.960]  and bloom outdoors.
[14:41.960 --> 14:46.780]  The determining factors are I'd like to know what I'm going to do with those plants before
[14:46.780 --> 14:48.000]  I start taking clones.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.240]  I already know that I need them for mothers for genetic preservation to provide clones
[14:53.240 --> 14:55.840]  and just to keep that genetic alive.
[14:55.840 --> 14:58.880]  That cultivar needs to exist via the mother plant.
[14:58.880 --> 15:03.400]  A lot of times I will know my goal for that plant, the ultimate goal.
[15:03.400 --> 15:05.440]  Is it going to go outdoors?
[15:05.440 --> 15:06.440]  Is it going to get tossed?
[15:06.440 --> 15:07.800]  Is it going to be a big clone donor?
[15:07.800 --> 15:09.640]  Is it going to go indoors to get flowered?
[15:09.640 --> 15:14.560]  I already have that goal in mind when I start taking cuts the very first time.
[15:14.560 --> 15:16.040]  Let's say I just got a new plant.
[15:16.040 --> 15:17.440]  I'm going to make it a mother plant.
[15:17.440 --> 15:18.440]  Here it is.
[15:18.440 --> 15:19.440]  This microphone is my new mother plant.
[15:19.440 --> 15:21.320]  I'm going to grow it.
[15:21.320 --> 15:23.720]  I'm going to grow it out.
[15:23.720 --> 15:26.480]  The first time I take cuts off of it, I've got a strategy.
[15:26.480 --> 15:28.000]  Is this going to end up outdoors?
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.980]  Is it going to end up in the flower room indoors?
[15:29.980 --> 15:33.200]  Is it going to make a bunch of clones or is it just going to end up dead on the floor
[15:33.200 --> 15:34.840]  after I've got the cuts I need?
[15:34.840 --> 15:37.960]  I will start that plan from the time I get it.
[15:38.040 --> 15:42.080]  From the time I cut this clone and grow it into a plant that I can work with, now I've
[15:42.080 --> 15:44.080]  got an idea of what it's going to be.
[15:44.080 --> 15:47.760]  90% of the time I always take that main top right out of the middle just to make the bottoms
[15:47.760 --> 15:49.440]  grow up and catch up.
[15:49.440 --> 15:51.040]  That's going to be my first clone.
[15:51.040 --> 15:54.520]  Then I usually go to the bottom and take three or four clones off the bottom just to clean
[15:54.520 --> 15:58.160]  it up and lollipop it, give it a little bit of health.
[15:58.160 --> 16:01.280]  Then I can start making it spread out the way that I need to from there.
[16:01.280 --> 16:03.320]  If it's going to go outside, I want a lot of tops.
[16:03.320 --> 16:04.980]  I want to make it a big bush.
[16:04.980 --> 16:07.400]  If it's going to go indoors, I have to keep it short and squat.
[16:07.400 --> 16:10.280]  So I take lots of clones off the top all the time.
[16:10.280 --> 16:14.640]  If it's going to be somebody that is just going to donate a lot of clones, I will top
[16:14.640 --> 16:15.640]  it low early.
[16:15.640 --> 16:18.400]  I apologize if you hear the dog drinking water in the background.
[16:18.400 --> 16:19.400]  Things are different here.
[16:19.400 --> 16:23.260]  We will make adjustments and get this corrected, but you may hear the dogs drinking right now.
[16:23.260 --> 16:26.240]  If I'm going to make a lot of clones, I'll top it early.
[16:26.240 --> 16:29.960]  That way it will spread out real far and then I'll just keep topping it to give me a lot
[16:29.960 --> 16:31.800]  of heads and a lot of tops.
[16:31.800 --> 16:35.220]  Every intersection where I get a node coming up and there's a branch coming off one way
[16:35.220 --> 16:39.340]  and a branch going one way, I'll cut it right between those, cut the peace sign out of it.
[16:39.340 --> 16:42.420]  That way I get two tops and then I'll do that again and repeat that.
[16:42.420 --> 16:44.580]  That way I can make a bunch and a bunch of clones.
[16:44.580 --> 16:49.060]  That plant will probably end up getting cloned to death and then as soon as I get roots off
[16:49.060 --> 16:51.700]  of my clones, that one gets chopped down and thrown away.
[16:51.700 --> 16:55.660]  So it's all about what I'm going to do with that plant, the ultimate goal.
[16:55.660 --> 16:59.500]  If I want to put it outside, it'll get fucking topped and spread out real far.
[16:59.500 --> 17:02.860]  If I'm going to put it indoors, it's got to stay squat and low because my indoor environment
[17:02.860 --> 17:03.860]  is kind of low.
[17:03.980 --> 17:07.940]  If it's going to be a clone donor, it gets topped early, spread out a lot, pulled down
[17:07.940 --> 17:12.180]  so I can make a lot, a lot of clone material from that plant.
[17:12.180 --> 17:15.200]  So it's all about the original or the ultimate goal.
[17:15.200 --> 17:18.780]  When I get that clone, I already know that idea before I start mothering that plant out.
[17:18.780 --> 17:21.220]  I have an idea of where it's going to go.
[17:21.220 --> 17:25.380]  They do need to be replaced about every three to six months, maybe more frequently depending
[17:25.380 --> 17:29.180]  on the health of your plant and your grow environment, the rate of growth, the lights
[17:29.180 --> 17:30.700]  you've got, the genetics.
[17:30.700 --> 17:34.380]  My Congo plant, I've got that Roberts Creek Congo.
[17:34.380 --> 17:38.780]  That fucker grows three times taller and faster than everybody else so I got to top her, replace
[17:38.780 --> 17:40.200]  her every so often.
[17:40.200 --> 17:42.300]  The Kemdela Kem grows super fast.
[17:42.300 --> 17:47.700]  However, the unicorn poop doesn't grow at all so I don't need to replace that one very
[17:47.700 --> 17:48.700]  often.
[17:48.700 --> 17:51.420]  It just makes a few shoots, super easy to manage, super easy to handle.
[17:51.420 --> 17:53.700]  So it's all about the genetics, all about the plants.
[17:53.700 --> 17:55.500]  Do I grow them or just ditch them?
[17:55.500 --> 17:56.500]  It depends.
[17:56.500 --> 17:58.740]  Sometimes they go outside and get pollinated.
[17:58.740 --> 18:01.100]  Sometimes they go outside and make big buds.
[18:01.100 --> 18:04.260]  Sometimes I cut a bunch of cuts off of them and give the cuts to my friends.
[18:04.260 --> 18:06.420]  It just kind of depends on the ultimate goal.
[18:06.420 --> 18:11.220]  Then it says you've had bad luck growing them out, mostly low yields.
[18:11.220 --> 18:13.180]  That's because probably I'm not there.
[18:13.180 --> 18:14.180]  I don't see what's going on.
[18:14.180 --> 18:18.260]  I don't have any evidence but probably just poor preparation.
[18:18.260 --> 18:21.020]  You're more focused on them being mother plants.
[18:21.020 --> 18:26.020]  You're more focused on them providing cuts so you're not preparing them to be flowered
[18:26.020 --> 18:27.020]  plants.
[18:27.340 --> 18:30.020]  I was trying to get the proper preparation.
[18:30.020 --> 18:32.020]  That was hard for my brain to even put together.
[18:32.020 --> 18:34.460]  But they weren't prepared properly to be flowered plants.
[18:34.460 --> 18:36.860]  You're only focusing on them as mothers.
[18:36.860 --> 18:40.860]  And oftentimes we don't focus enough on the veg or the mothers.
[18:40.860 --> 18:42.420]  We think we just need them alive.
[18:42.420 --> 18:43.740]  We need them in there.
[18:43.740 --> 18:47.100]  When they get into flower we'll really spoil them, really take care of them.
[18:47.100 --> 18:49.620]  And that is not really a good way.
[18:49.620 --> 18:50.620]  That's not a best practice.
[18:50.620 --> 18:52.700]  You need a good solid foundation.
[18:53.020 --> 18:57.300]  The foundation starts at the mother plant because you want a healthy mother plant to
[18:57.300 --> 18:58.620]  provide a healthy clone.
[18:58.620 --> 19:03.380]  The strong clone turns into a strong veg plant, turns into a bad ass flowering plant.
[19:03.380 --> 19:08.700]  You can't start off with a crappy weak mother plant or an unhealthy mother plant or an unhealthy
[19:08.700 --> 19:09.700]  clone.
[19:09.700 --> 19:13.820]  We've got to have the veg, the moms, the clones, everything all the way up to dry and cure
[19:13.820 --> 19:19.020]  harvest all has to be 100% top notch if you want it to be top notch.
[19:19.020 --> 19:20.020]  I'm not accusing you.
[19:20.020 --> 19:21.020]  I'm not pointing fingers.
[19:21.340 --> 19:25.580]  The possibility and option is that maybe your veg room, your mother plants aren't getting
[19:25.580 --> 19:27.460]  the care, the love that they need.
[19:27.460 --> 19:32.540]  So they're not as healthy and optimal as you can have them when it is time to flower them
[19:32.540 --> 19:33.820]  and make buds out of them.
[19:33.820 --> 19:35.580]  That is one thing that could be occurring.
[19:35.580 --> 19:38.580]  Again, I don't know the situation, but I'm just going with what I've got.
[19:38.580 --> 19:42.900]  Please don't feel like I'm accusing you, blaming anything on you, although it's your grow.
[19:42.900 --> 19:44.940]  So maybe they're just not prepared.
[19:44.940 --> 19:47.100]  And then it says one just died.
[19:47.100 --> 19:48.100]  Are they root bound?
[19:48.100 --> 19:49.180]  Are they getting too root bound?
[19:49.180 --> 19:50.460]  Are they going?
[19:50.460 --> 19:52.460]  Are they in larger pots before you flower them?
[19:52.460 --> 19:56.100]  Are they going their whole lives in a three, a five, a seven gallon pot and then you're
[19:56.100 --> 19:57.100]  flowering them out?
[19:57.100 --> 19:58.100]  They're getting root bound.
[19:58.100 --> 19:59.420]  Are you over watering them?
[19:59.420 --> 20:04.520]  Is it just the stress and the shock from going from being a mom plant being in veg constantly
[20:04.520 --> 20:06.080]  into a flower room?
[20:06.080 --> 20:07.580]  Are you putting them outside?
[20:07.580 --> 20:11.660]  There are a lot of variables here, but I would think maybe they're getting root bound or
[20:11.660 --> 20:15.180]  something if they're just dying or maybe that light stress is killing them or maybe you're
[20:15.180 --> 20:16.180]  over watering.
[20:16.180 --> 20:20.000]  I really think it is an overall plant health issue.
[20:20.000 --> 20:23.520]  You're not treating the mother plants from the very beginning as plants that are going
[20:23.520 --> 20:24.520]  to be flowered.
[20:24.520 --> 20:27.520]  You're using them just simply as genetic preservation.
[20:27.520 --> 20:29.360]  They're not getting the love, the care, the attention.
[20:29.360 --> 20:30.880]  They're not robust enough.
[20:30.880 --> 20:36.120]  They don't have the strength, the vigor to follow through and continue as powerful flowering
[20:36.120 --> 20:37.120]  plants.
[20:37.120 --> 20:38.120]  That is my guess, my estimate.
[20:38.120 --> 20:43.240]  Again, I don't have a lot of information here, so I'm just going with what I can guess with.
[20:43.240 --> 20:46.000]  Dude, thank you for the great recommendation on the podcast.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.520]  If there is more info to this, please do follow up.
[20:48.520 --> 20:51.000]  Of course, you've got my email address.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.920]  Looks like you sent it to growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[20:53.920 --> 20:56.640]  Please do send it that direction.
[20:56.640 --> 20:58.840]  Thank you for the great question.
[20:58.840 --> 21:02.420]  Let's get your mother plant styled in so that we can keep you on a perpetual cycle.
[21:02.420 --> 21:08.000]  Some people will actually take their mother plants, cut a few clones from it, then flower
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.800]  the mother plant so that they don't ever actually have a mother plant.
[21:10.800 --> 21:15.240]  It's a perpetual cycle where we're using a mother plant, a veg plant as a mother plant.
[21:15.240 --> 21:19.880]  You can actually veg it, grow it, cut clones from it, then put that one into flower, then
[21:19.880 --> 21:23.740]  grow some of those clones out, veg those, put those into flower.
[21:23.740 --> 21:26.080]  It's a perpetual cycle without a mother plant.
[21:26.080 --> 21:30.880]  If we can keep you in healthy plants, we can create a perpetual cycle that way without
[21:30.880 --> 21:35.080]  any struggles and without plants dying early in the flowering phase.
[21:35.080 --> 21:37.800]  All right, I do have one more question here in front of me.
[21:37.800 --> 21:41.160]  We're going to cover this one from our friend Dinger.
[21:41.160 --> 21:43.660]  Big shout out to our buddy Dinger from Illinois.
[21:43.660 --> 21:45.900]  This message goes just like this.
[21:45.900 --> 21:47.220]  It says, Rasta Jeff.
[21:47.220 --> 21:48.220]  That's me, bro.
[21:48.220 --> 21:49.720]  It says, much love from Illinois.
[21:49.720 --> 21:54.260]  Thanks for putting out the positivity and directness into the show and your work.
[21:54.260 --> 21:55.820]  You do not fuck around.
[21:55.820 --> 21:56.820]  Thank you, bro.
[21:56.820 --> 22:01.020]  I'm glad it's noticed that I'm here to teach directly, try to get the message across, try
[22:01.020 --> 22:03.620]  to speak in a way that everybody can understand.
[22:03.620 --> 22:07.180]  Also in the seed game, I try to get shit out that is reliable, that is solid.
[22:07.180 --> 22:08.700]  I don't want to waste anybody's time.
[22:08.700 --> 22:10.640]  I know that you guys work hard for your money.
[22:10.640 --> 22:11.860]  Money is expensive.
[22:11.860 --> 22:13.380]  You choose to give me money for your seeds.
[22:14.100 --> 22:17.180]  I want to make sure you get a quality product that will give you a quality return.
[22:17.180 --> 22:18.740]  That is my ultimate goal there.
[22:18.740 --> 22:21.900]  Make you happy with me so that when you see me at an event, you don't go, man, I gave
[22:21.900 --> 22:23.460]  that guy money for seeds and they sucked.
[22:23.460 --> 22:24.460]  Fuck that guy.
[22:24.460 --> 22:27.260]  I want you to say, I gave that guy money for seeds and they were some of the best seeds
[22:27.260 --> 22:28.260]  I ever grew.
[22:28.260 --> 22:29.260]  That is my goal.
[22:29.260 --> 22:30.740]  I want you to come and give me a hug and be happy about it.
[22:30.740 --> 22:31.740]  You're right.
[22:31.740 --> 22:35.440]  I do not fuck around, although I do like to have a lot of fun.
[22:35.440 --> 22:39.620]  We're fucking around the whole time, keeping a smile on our faces while getting shit done.
[22:39.620 --> 22:41.140]  All right, I am back.
[22:41.140 --> 22:43.340]  I had to go referee a dog wrestling match.
[22:44.300 --> 22:45.300]  I think everybody is in their own corners.
[22:45.300 --> 22:46.980]  I think everybody's going to regroup.
[22:46.980 --> 22:49.220]  We've called a truce for the time being.
[22:49.220 --> 22:52.060]  I think everybody's distracted and busy for a minute.
[22:52.060 --> 22:53.220]  Let's get back into this message.
[22:53.220 --> 22:55.300]  I do apologize for the distractions.
[22:55.300 --> 22:59.980]  It does say, I've been growing for two years now and within the last nine months with help
[22:59.980 --> 23:05.120]  from your show and the Dude Grow Show, I went from harvesting shitty genetics in a substandard
[23:05.120 --> 23:10.660]  plant environment to growing some dank genetics and even making my own silver thiosulfate
[23:10.660 --> 23:15.300]  solution, fem seeds and growing out dank that I have bred myself.
[23:15.300 --> 23:17.700]  Dude, that is such a great sentence to read.
[23:17.700 --> 23:18.700]  Congratulations.
[23:18.700 --> 23:22.420]  You went from, it sounds like you were kind of struggling and trying to figure it out
[23:22.420 --> 23:27.880]  to breeding your own seeds and harvesting them and growing some dank from those seeds.
[23:27.880 --> 23:30.540]  That is a full circle, a full cycle.
[23:30.540 --> 23:32.540]  You are self-sufficient now, my dude.
[23:32.540 --> 23:33.540]  Congratulations.
[23:33.540 --> 23:34.540]  I know how that feels.
[23:34.540 --> 23:35.540]  I've been there.
[23:35.540 --> 23:36.540]  Welcome to the gang.
[23:36.540 --> 23:37.540]  Good job.
[23:37.540 --> 23:38.540]  Let's see what's going on.
[23:38.540 --> 23:40.980]  It says, I just popped a pack of Saka Souffle.
[23:40.980 --> 23:43.220]  I'm looking for that bubblegum cough syrup turp.
[23:43.220 --> 23:44.500]  I hope you find that one, bro.
[23:44.500 --> 23:45.500]  That's a winner.
[23:45.500 --> 23:47.500]  It says, I couldn't thank you enough, my dude.
[23:47.500 --> 23:48.660]  You are very welcome, bro.
[23:48.660 --> 23:51.020]  Thank you for the encouragement.
[23:51.020 --> 23:56.220]  Thank you for the compliments and congratulations on your improvements and your success.
[23:56.220 --> 23:58.700]  Now it does say, onto the question.
[23:58.700 --> 24:02.980]  I just recently picked up a pack of seeds which were labeled GMO BX3F2.
[24:02.980 --> 24:06.580]  I already see where this is going.
[24:06.620 --> 24:08.500]  That could get confusing.
[24:08.500 --> 24:10.020]  Then there is a description.
[24:10.020 --> 24:16.060]  It says, the Larry OG clone was crossed into SFVOG to provide the original male pollen
[24:16.060 --> 24:17.580]  on the first bat cross.
[24:17.580 --> 24:22.860]  The breeder selected plants from the BX3 to make his F2 seeds.
[24:22.860 --> 24:23.860]  Now it does go on.
[24:23.860 --> 24:29.160]  It says, how much variation would one expect to find in a second filial generation of something
[24:29.160 --> 24:31.940]  that has been bat crossed three times?
[24:31.940 --> 24:33.260]  Thanks from Dinger.
[24:34.140 --> 24:38.340]  There's one part here where it says, the Larry OG clone was crossed to SFVOG to provide the
[24:38.340 --> 24:43.540]  pollen to make the first original bat cross.
[24:43.540 --> 24:44.540]  That's not a bat cross.
[24:44.540 --> 24:45.660]  That's an out cross, right?
[24:45.660 --> 24:48.340]  Unless Larry OG, that's not.
[24:48.340 --> 24:51.540]  We're going to skip that part because parts of that right there do make it sound a little
[24:51.540 --> 24:52.540]  bit wonky.
[24:52.540 --> 24:54.060]  I'm not sure what that part is about.
[24:54.060 --> 24:59.860]  Let's talk about this labeling of GMO BX3F2 and then we'll answer the rest of the question
[24:59.860 --> 25:01.700]  because I want to cover this.
[25:01.820 --> 25:03.820]  GMO BX3.
[25:03.820 --> 25:05.700]  That sounds like just a bunch of random stuff.
[25:05.700 --> 25:07.340]  Somebody has the GMO plant.
[25:07.340 --> 25:08.700]  I've talked about GMO before.
[25:08.700 --> 25:11.500]  It does not stand for garlic, mushroom, onions.
[25:11.500 --> 25:12.500]  Get that out of your head.
[25:12.500 --> 25:13.500]  That's bullshit.
[25:13.500 --> 25:14.500]  That's not what it stands for.
[25:14.500 --> 25:19.220]  GMO is called GMO because it smells like crazy chemicals and it's got Girl Scout, the strain
[25:19.220 --> 25:20.740]  Girl Scout cookies in it.
[25:20.740 --> 25:24.960]  And when it got popular, the Girl Scout cookies were under scrutiny for it being discovered
[25:24.960 --> 25:30.540]  that they were using genetically modified organisms in their fancy ass Girl Scout cookies.
[25:30.540 --> 25:34.540]  So at the time, they called the Girl Scout cookies cross that smelled like chemicals
[25:34.540 --> 25:35.540]  GMO.
[25:35.540 --> 25:37.700]  Ask Skunk Master Flex.
[25:37.700 --> 25:38.700]  That's the fucking story.
[25:38.700 --> 25:40.220]  Quit making shit up, you guys.
[25:40.220 --> 25:41.220]  Let's get back to it.
[25:41.220 --> 25:42.220]  GMO.
[25:42.220 --> 25:44.380]  We've got a GMO BX3.
[25:44.380 --> 25:49.500]  That means that somebody took a GMO plant and they back crossed it to one of its parents.
[25:49.500 --> 25:53.300]  In this story that I read, part of it is convoluted, so we're going to leave that part out.
[25:53.300 --> 25:59.140]  But we're going to say for the sake of real talk here, they took the GMO plant and BX3'd
[25:59.140 --> 26:00.140]  it.
[26:00.740 --> 26:03.300]  So they took the GMO plant, probably the female.
[26:03.300 --> 26:04.780]  So they took the GMO plant.
[26:04.780 --> 26:06.780]  They've got the female GMO.
[26:06.780 --> 26:10.300]  Then they take a male plant that was a parent of the GMO.
[26:10.300 --> 26:13.300]  That's where the story confuses me here because I don't know the exact parents of the GMO.
[26:13.300 --> 26:14.660]  I don't think it was Lariogi.
[26:14.660 --> 26:16.440]  I don't think it was SFE.
[26:16.440 --> 26:17.500]  So we're going to leave that part out.
[26:17.500 --> 26:20.880]  But we'll talk about this just for the sake of what the real BX3 is.
[26:20.880 --> 26:22.420]  They took the GMO.
[26:22.420 --> 26:25.780]  Then they took a parent of the GMO to make it a real back cross.
[26:25.780 --> 26:30.460]  So they take a parent of it and pollinate that to the new GMO.
[26:30.460 --> 26:33.180]  So it's just a parent pollinating a child, which sounds crazy.
[26:33.180 --> 26:34.620]  But in plants, that does work.
[26:34.620 --> 26:36.220]  That's why it's a back cross.
[26:36.220 --> 26:37.220]  We went back.
[26:37.220 --> 26:42.620]  We took a child and we pollinate, went back and got pollen from a parent and put that
[26:42.620 --> 26:43.620]  on the plant.
[26:43.620 --> 26:44.620]  Now we've made our BX1.
[26:44.620 --> 26:46.340]  Now we're going to grow those out.
[26:46.340 --> 26:50.080]  We're going to find a plant that looks just like the GMO.
[26:50.080 --> 26:51.380]  Now they could have done a couple of things.
[26:51.380 --> 26:52.660]  I'm not sure which way they did it.
[26:52.660 --> 26:56.900]  But at this point, you take pollen from one plant and put it on the female.
[26:56.900 --> 27:01.260]  That way we're using the parent plant and the offspring to keep going original parent
[27:01.260 --> 27:02.980]  to further generation offspring.
[27:02.980 --> 27:08.140]  The idea here is to lock in those traits of the GMO to make it look just like GMO every
[27:08.140 --> 27:09.140]  time.
[27:09.140 --> 27:10.220]  That's the way we back cross it.
[27:10.220 --> 27:13.960]  And this would be done because maybe we don't have an original pollen donor.
[27:13.960 --> 27:15.200]  Maybe we've got a female.
[27:15.200 --> 27:17.180]  Maybe we've only got a male.
[27:17.180 --> 27:19.500]  Back crossing could be done for several reasons.
[27:19.500 --> 27:21.620]  And they do explain the pollen they use.
[27:21.620 --> 27:25.500]  But that dilutes the story of the back cross and that makes it confusing here.
[27:25.500 --> 27:27.260]  I don't know enough about that.
[27:27.260 --> 27:28.740]  So we've got our back cross.
[27:28.740 --> 27:33.580]  We took a parent and we pollinated a female, one of the children.
[27:33.580 --> 27:35.420]  Then we found a child out of that.
[27:35.420 --> 27:38.180]  And then we pollinated that child again with our original parent.
[27:38.180 --> 27:39.180]  Then we did it again.
[27:39.180 --> 27:41.900]  We did that three times, three back crosses.
[27:41.900 --> 27:47.660]  Now F2, we take a batch of the BX3, the back cross third generation.
[27:47.660 --> 27:49.540]  We've got a handful of those seeds.
[27:49.540 --> 27:53.100]  Now we grow those and we find a boy and we find a girl.
[27:53.100 --> 27:55.700]  I may have to go referee a dog fight, but we'll edit that out.
[27:55.700 --> 27:58.660]  We find a boy and a girl and we breed those together.
[27:58.660 --> 28:03.620]  What comes from those is now the F2 generation of that back cross.
[28:03.620 --> 28:07.860]  We made the BX1, the parent to the child, and then we found a seed.
[28:07.860 --> 28:10.180]  Then we took a parent to that child.
[28:10.180 --> 28:12.720]  And then we found that seed and we took a parent to that child.
[28:12.720 --> 28:14.300]  That is a BX3.
[28:14.300 --> 28:17.620]  Now we take a batch of those seeds and find a boy and a girl and breed.
[28:17.620 --> 28:19.260]  That is a filial, an F1.
[28:19.980 --> 28:21.740]  That's a BX1 or a BX3.
[28:21.740 --> 28:23.060]  Also that is the F1.
[28:23.060 --> 28:24.540]  It's a first filial generation.
[28:24.540 --> 28:27.420]  Every time you make something, it's technically an F1.
[28:27.420 --> 28:28.900]  So that's an F1 of that.
[28:28.900 --> 28:32.380]  So we'll find a boy and a girl from that F1 and breed them.
[28:32.380 --> 28:36.700]  We have now made the F2 filial generation of that back cross.
[28:36.700 --> 28:38.940]  That is a BX3F2.
[28:38.940 --> 28:43.420]  That is a lot to get to to explain that, but that does make sense if you followed along.
[28:43.420 --> 28:48.600]  Now the question is, how much variation would one expect to find in a second filial generation
[28:48.600 --> 28:53.000]  of something that has been back crossed three times?
[28:53.000 --> 28:59.560]  I don't have a definite, definitive, solid answer because it is all about selection.
[28:59.560 --> 29:03.480]  If the proper selections were made, it could be very uniform.
[29:03.480 --> 29:07.400]  If the proper selections were not made, it could be fucking wild.
[29:07.400 --> 29:11.280]  We've got a couple of things working for us and working against us.
[29:11.280 --> 29:18.480]  The BX3, if done properly, should be narrowed down to where approximately 85% of the phenotypes
[29:18.520 --> 29:22.040]  will represent the original parent they were trying to replicate.
[29:22.040 --> 29:28.720]  If done properly, 85 to 92%-ish of those seeds should come out looking like the original
[29:28.720 --> 29:32.480]  parent we had intended to replicate in this back cross.
[29:32.480 --> 29:36.960]  If this was done correctly, there's no correct or incorrect.
[29:36.960 --> 29:43.680]  It's all about selection and intuition and aliel charts and then honestly seeing if nature
[29:43.680 --> 29:46.300]  worked the way we hoped it would when we did the cross.
[29:46.300 --> 29:48.620]  Sometimes you nail it, sometimes you fucking miss it.
[29:48.620 --> 29:51.600]  This is the time when we do the cross, see if it works.
[29:51.600 --> 29:55.700]  If it doesn't, you got to go backwards another generation and just start over with different
[29:55.700 --> 29:56.700]  plants.
[29:56.700 --> 30:00.540]  If we did the selections properly, by the time you get to that BX3, you have got really
[30:00.540 --> 30:04.940]  stable, really locked in expressions of phenotypes.
[30:04.940 --> 30:07.340]  Now, it gets crazy when we make F2s.
[30:07.340 --> 30:10.740]  F2 is kind of the Pandora's box of genetics.
[30:10.740 --> 30:16.380]  When you make the F2, that's where we see plants that look a lot like mommy, plants
[30:16.380 --> 30:21.540]  that look a lot like the daddy, but then we also see grandparents of both plants and grandparents
[30:21.540 --> 30:24.080]  of those grandparents of both plants.
[30:24.080 --> 30:30.040]  We can sometimes find, F2s can sometimes find the most amazing plants you've ever seen and
[30:30.040 --> 30:34.420]  also the worst plants you've ever grown in the same batch.
[30:34.420 --> 30:36.620]  That is the potential of an F2.
[30:36.620 --> 30:38.980]  You may find amazing fire in there.
[30:38.980 --> 30:43.800]  You may find complete garbage in there because we're opening up a Pandora's box of genetics.
[30:43.800 --> 30:45.780]  Everything that is available is in there.
[30:45.780 --> 30:49.340]  You're going to see traits, like I said a moment ago, traits from the mom, traits from
[30:49.340 --> 30:54.780]  the dad, then traits from mom's mom and dad and traits from dad's mom and dad.
[30:54.780 --> 30:59.140]  Then you may, if you understand and know the expressions and the parents of those plants,
[30:59.140 --> 31:02.580]  you may see further down the line on both sides.
[31:02.580 --> 31:04.700]  The F2 is where you're going to see weird shit.
[31:04.780 --> 31:08.980]  Honestly, I can't answer your question directly because we've got a couple of variables.
[31:08.980 --> 31:15.000]  We've got the BX3, which if done correctly is really locked in, then the F2 is going
[31:15.000 --> 31:21.220]  to open Pandora's box, but I'm not sure how much of Pandora's box was washed out by the
[31:21.220 --> 31:22.620]  BX crosses.
[31:22.620 --> 31:26.940]  If we selected properly, we pushed out a lot of that bullshit that we didn't want, so it
[31:26.940 --> 31:29.940]  may or may not appear in the F2 generation.
[31:29.940 --> 31:33.220]  I haven't done this, so I don't know.
[31:33.220 --> 31:38.980]  Then it talks about the Larry OG clone crossed into SFV to provide pollen in the first bat
[31:38.980 --> 31:46.460]  cross, which means now we've got GMO and Larry OG and SFV, so we could see traits of the
[31:46.460 --> 31:47.460]  Larry.
[31:47.460 --> 31:48.820]  We could see traits of the SFV.
[31:48.820 --> 31:51.180]  We could see traits of the original GMO.
[31:51.180 --> 31:52.480]  We could see traits of the chem.
[31:52.480 --> 31:54.320]  We could see traits of the kush.
[31:54.320 --> 31:56.420]  We could see traits of Girl Scout cookies.
[31:56.420 --> 32:00.380]  We could see a lot of different traits in here, a lot of different variables.
[32:00.460 --> 32:06.740]  I'm not exactly sure how to answer that because I've never done a BX3, then F2'd it.
[32:06.740 --> 32:08.460]  The BX3 would get me where I needed to be.
[32:08.460 --> 32:13.980]  I feel like the F2 may cause problems, may unlock Pandora's box, may just lead you to
[32:13.980 --> 32:17.180]  F3 it so you could relock in the traits that you lost from F1.
[32:17.180 --> 32:19.020]  I may just stick at the F1.
[32:19.020 --> 32:24.540]  The BX3 is probably ... I would have gone BX4 is what I would have done, but shout out
[32:24.540 --> 32:26.340]  to the breeder that did this, that did this work.
[32:26.340 --> 32:27.340]  That's a lot of breeding.
[32:27.340 --> 32:28.580]  That's a long way to go.
[32:28.580 --> 32:29.660]  I wish I was more clear.
[32:29.660 --> 32:33.620]  I understand they used the Larry OG to SFE to make the pollen.
[32:33.620 --> 32:35.300]  You had to use something to make a back cross.
[32:35.300 --> 32:36.300]  That does make sense.
[32:36.300 --> 32:38.740]  So you open it up and then put it back to itself.
[32:38.740 --> 32:40.940]  Got to start that project somewhere.
[32:40.940 --> 32:42.700]  I do not have a direct answer for you, my dude.
[32:42.700 --> 32:46.540]  I apologize for that, but I think I rambled on long enough to give you ideas.
[32:46.540 --> 32:47.940]  You may see Larry traits.
[32:47.940 --> 32:49.340]  You may see SFV traits.
[32:49.340 --> 32:50.420]  You may see chem traits.
[32:50.420 --> 32:52.140]  You may see cookies traits.
[32:52.140 --> 32:54.540]  It depends on how the selections were done.
[32:54.540 --> 32:56.380]  They could be completely uniform.
[32:56.380 --> 32:58.500]  They may be completely wild.
[32:58.500 --> 33:00.580]  Find the phenotype that works best for you.
[33:00.580 --> 33:02.520]  Clone that bad bitch and grow it forever.
[33:02.520 --> 33:08.380]  If you've got seeds, maybe make that F3 filial generation if that's something that you can
[33:08.380 --> 33:09.380]  do.
[33:09.380 --> 33:11.580]  All right, my dude Dinger, I want to thank you for the great question.
[33:11.580 --> 33:12.580]  That was a really good one.
[33:12.580 --> 33:13.660]  Got me going for a good time.
[33:13.660 --> 33:14.860]  Got me rambling for quite a while.
[33:14.860 --> 33:16.060]  I do appreciate it.
[33:16.060 --> 33:20.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[33:20.460 --> 33:25.220]  cutters, dog people, cat people, even people without pets, I want to thank each and every
