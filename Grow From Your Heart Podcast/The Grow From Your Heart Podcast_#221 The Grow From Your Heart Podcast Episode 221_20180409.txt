[00:17.020 --> 00:19.360]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:19.360 --> 00:21.160]  It's time for episode number 221
[00:21.160 --> 00:23.060]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.060 --> 00:26.780]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:26.780 --> 00:27.980]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:27.980 --> 00:29.220]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.220 --> 00:31.660]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.660 --> 00:33.620]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:33.620 --> 00:36.260]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.260 --> 00:39.100]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.100 --> 00:41.020]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.020 --> 00:42.900]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.900 --> 00:45.020]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.020 --> 00:46.660]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.660 --> 00:49.180]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.180 --> 00:50.980]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot,
[00:50.980 --> 00:53.220]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.100 --> 00:58.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am recording on Tuesday, June 27th,
[00:58.860 --> 01:01.980]  and it was 100 degrees outside today in Colorado.
[01:01.980 --> 01:03.460]  I hope you survived.
[01:03.460 --> 01:05.140]  I hope you've got your air conditioning situation
[01:05.140 --> 01:05.980]  figured out.
[01:05.980 --> 01:08.360]  I hope nothing went too hot in your grow room.
[01:08.360 --> 01:10.620]  I hope you were staying hydrated.
[01:10.620 --> 01:11.860]  It was hard to dab today, you guys.
[01:11.860 --> 01:14.780]  I felt like when I took dabs, my brain was just cooking.
[01:14.780 --> 01:16.460]  It was a long, hot day.
[01:17.260 --> 01:18.100]  Happy summer, everybody.
[01:18.100 --> 01:18.920]  Happy summer.
[01:18.920 --> 01:19.760]  Welcome to the summer.
[01:19.760 --> 01:20.580]  It's gonna be a long, hot summer.
[01:20.580 --> 01:21.420]  I hope you're prepared.
[01:21.420 --> 01:22.260]  Get some air conditioning.
[01:22.260 --> 01:23.140]  Fans aren't gonna cut it.
[01:23.140 --> 01:26.460]  You need to replace that hot air with fresh, cool air.
[01:26.460 --> 01:27.900]  You need to cool down the hot air.
[01:27.900 --> 01:29.700]  A fan is just gonna blow that heat around
[01:29.700 --> 01:30.580]  and piss your plants off.
[01:30.580 --> 01:32.220]  So figure out some air conditioning
[01:32.220 --> 01:33.720]  for your grow room soon, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:33.720 --> 01:36.460]  because it's only going to get hotter.
[01:36.460 --> 01:37.780]  Also, speaking of heat,
[01:37.780 --> 01:39.580]  if you hear a little rattle noise in the background,
[01:39.580 --> 01:40.840]  a little fluttering sound,
[01:40.840 --> 01:42.520]  that, of course, is the air conditioner.
[01:42.520 --> 01:44.700]  That is the only thing keeping me sane right now.
[01:44.700 --> 01:47.820]  I apologize if that is interrupting the podcast.
[01:47.820 --> 01:51.460]  Without that, I may go crazy and smash some shit.
[01:51.460 --> 01:52.620]  To tell you the truth, it's too fucking hot.
[01:52.620 --> 01:53.460]  I hate the heat.
[01:53.460 --> 01:54.700]  I'm not a fan of the heat, which sucks,
[01:54.700 --> 01:55.540]  because when it gets cold,
[01:55.540 --> 01:57.380]  I'm gonna bitch and complain about the cold also.
[01:57.380 --> 01:59.140]  I wish we could just have a nice, even climate
[01:59.140 --> 02:00.540]  and make everything iry.
[02:00.540 --> 02:01.380]  That's what I wish.
[02:01.380 --> 02:02.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast.
[02:02.540 --> 02:03.540]  Thanks for joining me.
[02:03.540 --> 02:04.940]  Thanks for listening to me ramble on
[02:04.940 --> 02:06.220]  for a couple of minutes already.
[02:06.220 --> 02:07.920]  I do have a podcast planned for you.
[02:07.920 --> 02:09.680]  Before we get there, I wanna give a huge thanks
[02:09.680 --> 02:11.740]  to some people on the last episode,
[02:11.740 --> 02:13.300]  or two episodes ago, actually.
[02:13.300 --> 02:15.460]  I mentioned that I have bred a new strain
[02:15.460 --> 02:16.820]  and that I was growing the seeds
[02:16.820 --> 02:19.060]  and that that new project needs a name.
[02:19.060 --> 02:21.820]  I got a lot of responses through Instagram,
[02:21.820 --> 02:23.540]  through Twitter, through email.
[02:23.540 --> 02:25.140]  A lot of people responded.
[02:25.140 --> 02:27.220]  The cross that I'm looking for a name for
[02:27.220 --> 02:28.900]  is Flo from DJ Short.
[02:28.900 --> 02:31.260]  That's right, I've got a clone of DJ Short's Flo,
[02:31.260 --> 02:34.260]  and I pollinated that with my male Arise,
[02:34.260 --> 02:37.460]  and I need a name for Flo cross to Arise.
[02:37.460 --> 02:39.300]  A lot of people have sent suggestions.
[02:39.300 --> 02:40.340]  There's some good stuff in there.
[02:40.340 --> 02:41.180]  I have a good idea.
[02:41.180 --> 02:43.620]  I actually came up with a good idea on my own
[02:43.620 --> 02:47.740]  that may get used, but I haven't decided yet.
[02:47.740 --> 02:49.940]  If you've got a name that you'd like to submit
[02:49.940 --> 02:51.540]  for consideration for this,
[02:51.540 --> 02:53.380]  or maybe if you've got a word
[02:53.380 --> 02:55.220]  that you'd just like to put out there to be a strain name,
[02:55.220 --> 02:57.060]  send it to me, let me know somehow.
[02:57.060 --> 02:58.300]  Contact me via email.
[02:58.300 --> 03:00.020]  It's girlfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[03:00.020 --> 03:03.140]  You can send it to me on Twitter at GFYH podcast,
[03:03.140 --> 03:04.960]  or if we happen to be Instagram friends,
[03:04.960 --> 03:06.940]  if you follow me on Instagram, you can send it to me.
[03:06.940 --> 03:09.900]  On Instagram, my Instagram account is irie underscore
[03:09.900 --> 03:10.740]  genetics, that's right.
[03:11.260 --> 03:13.480]  Irie genetics, that's me on Instagram.
[03:13.480 --> 03:16.340]  So if you've got an idea for Flo cross to the Arise,
[03:16.340 --> 03:19.100]  Flo was the female, Arise was the male.
[03:19.100 --> 03:21.140]  Something that means like upward flowing energy
[03:21.140 --> 03:22.620]  is kind of what I'm looking for.
[03:22.620 --> 03:25.300]  I've got a word in mind, but I'm not certain.
[03:25.300 --> 03:28.020]  It's not like a real easy to say word or real popular word,
[03:28.020 --> 03:31.060]  so I don't know if I want to put that label on there,
[03:31.060 --> 03:31.900]  but you never know.
[03:31.900 --> 03:32.720]  I might do that.
[03:32.720 --> 03:34.020]  I do weird shit with my strain names.
[03:34.020 --> 03:35.220]  I like one word names.
[03:35.220 --> 03:36.700]  I like cool stuff.
[03:36.700 --> 03:38.820]  Reggae related, Grateful Dead related,
[03:38.820 --> 03:41.820]  positive moving words, stuff like that.
[03:41.820 --> 03:42.940]  It's kind of where I'm going with it.
[03:42.940 --> 03:44.660]  Anyway, send me your suggestions.
[03:44.660 --> 03:47.260]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com at GFYH podcast
[03:47.260 --> 03:51.340]  on Twitter or irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[03:51.340 --> 03:52.900]  Or of course there's the Facebook,
[03:52.900 --> 03:55.580]  simply grow from your heart podcast on Facebook.
[03:55.580 --> 03:57.820]  I want to know your suggestions.
[03:57.820 --> 03:59.460]  Also on the last episode,
[03:59.460 --> 04:03.620]  I talked about the screen of green technique.
[04:03.620 --> 04:05.900]  That episode went up Monday and this morning,
[04:05.900 --> 04:08.620]  Tuesday when I woke up, I checked my email
[04:09.420 --> 04:10.260]  and this is in my email.
[04:10.260 --> 04:11.540]  It says, hey, thanks for the podcast, man.
[04:11.540 --> 04:13.140]  You answered my question spot on.
[04:13.140 --> 04:15.380]  I'm going to use the trellis on my next grow.
[04:15.380 --> 04:17.700]  Thanks for explaining in a simple way.
[04:17.700 --> 04:19.100]  I'm going to skip the next couple of lines
[04:19.100 --> 04:20.420]  because it reveals too much about you
[04:20.420 --> 04:22.660]  and I'm not sure that you want people to know who you are
[04:22.660 --> 04:23.460]  and that's a little personal.
[04:23.460 --> 04:24.340]  So I'm going to skip that.
[04:24.340 --> 04:26.700]  And then you say, I will probably bug you in the future
[04:26.700 --> 04:27.980]  with a question if you got time.
[04:27.980 --> 04:29.100]  Thanks again, man.
[04:29.100 --> 04:30.740]  Your show has been a lifesaver.
[04:30.740 --> 04:32.820]  Love being able to listen.
[04:32.820 --> 04:34.860]  Love being able to learn from a good source.
[04:34.860 --> 04:38.180]  Thanks for the hard work you put in it, man.
[04:38.820 --> 04:40.300]  Bug me with more questions, please.
[04:40.300 --> 04:41.500]  You were not bugging me at all.
[04:41.500 --> 04:44.220]  I love listener generated content.
[04:44.220 --> 04:46.300]  That lets me know that I'm hitting my target audience.
[04:46.300 --> 04:47.660]  I was able to answer a question
[04:47.660 --> 04:50.060]  and put out a great podcast at the same time.
[04:50.060 --> 04:51.740]  I'm sure I helped you with your grow.
[04:51.740 --> 04:53.540]  Hopefully I helped a whole bunch of other people.
[04:53.540 --> 04:55.380]  Now that information is out there.
[04:55.380 --> 04:56.420]  Without your inspiration,
[04:56.420 --> 04:58.060]  that episode would not have happened.
[04:58.060 --> 05:00.020]  So it works perfectly for both of us.
[05:00.020 --> 05:02.460]  I got some content, you got to learn something.
[05:02.460 --> 05:04.060]  So thanks a lot for your help.
[05:04.060 --> 05:05.260]  Please ask me more questions.
[05:05.260 --> 05:07.260]  You say you'll probably bug me in the future.
[05:07.260 --> 05:08.180]  You're never bugging me.
[05:08.180 --> 05:09.380]  That's what I'm here for.
[05:09.380 --> 05:11.340]  I want to help you grow a better herb.
[05:11.340 --> 05:13.260]  Then you say, thanks, I've been a lifesaver.
[05:13.260 --> 05:14.580]  That's pretty awesome to know.
[05:14.580 --> 05:15.580]  I like saving lives.
[05:15.580 --> 05:17.780]  Hopefully saving the lives of lots of cannabis plants,
[05:17.780 --> 05:20.100]  improving the lives of lots of ganja plants.
[05:20.100 --> 05:21.660]  And then you said, thanks for the hard work.
[05:21.660 --> 05:22.860]  Dude, you're very welcome.
[05:22.860 --> 05:24.260]  Thanks for noticing.
[05:24.260 --> 05:25.140]  Thanks for reaching out.
[05:25.140 --> 05:26.220]  And if you ever have more questions,
[05:26.220 --> 05:28.460]  please, please, please email me.
[05:28.460 --> 05:29.300]  You know how to do it.
[05:29.300 --> 05:30.140]  You just send me this email.
[05:30.140 --> 05:31.580]  Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[05:31.580 --> 05:32.900]  Thanks again for the email.
[05:32.900 --> 05:34.820]  I think I just called you G on the last episode
[05:34.820 --> 05:36.980]  because I don't know if you want me to say your name or not.
[05:37.940 --> 05:39.380]  But G, big up G.
[05:39.380 --> 05:41.620]  Thanks for that message.
[05:42.580 --> 05:43.420]  Perfect timing, right?
[05:43.420 --> 05:44.460]  Just song ends also.
[05:44.460 --> 05:46.140]  All right, I do have another email that I want to get into.
[05:46.140 --> 05:47.820]  We're just going to read a couple of emails on this episode.
[05:47.820 --> 05:48.700]  Why not?
[05:48.700 --> 05:50.900]  I like all this listener generated content.
[05:50.900 --> 05:53.080]  Like I said, that lets me know that I'm helping somebody out.
[05:53.080 --> 05:55.580]  If you ask me this question, you obviously need the answer.
[05:55.580 --> 05:57.300]  So I'm trying to get through as many of these emails
[05:57.300 --> 05:59.940]  as I can and give them solid answers.
[05:59.940 --> 06:01.500]  So let's get right into this one.
[06:01.500 --> 06:04.220]  This one starts off in big, bold capital letters.
[06:04.220 --> 06:07.780]  Please try not to use my real name in my email address
[06:07.780 --> 06:09.980]  if you do this in the podcast.
[06:09.980 --> 06:11.460]  Then he says, if you do, it's cool.
[06:11.460 --> 06:12.300]  I'm not super worried.
[06:12.300 --> 06:13.180]  Thanks, homie.
[06:13.180 --> 06:14.620]  Then he goes on to say, and don't worry, bro.
[06:14.620 --> 06:15.460]  I'm not going to say your name.
[06:15.460 --> 06:16.540]  I'll keep you undercover.
[06:16.540 --> 06:18.380]  You can be incognito with me.
[06:18.380 --> 06:20.420]  He goes on to say, sort of long-time listener here.
[06:20.420 --> 06:22.740]  I love listening to you and the gang get high as fuck
[06:22.740 --> 06:24.340]  and do your throwback podcast.
[06:24.340 --> 06:25.940]  They've been great for re-listening
[06:25.940 --> 06:27.260]  while I set up a new grow.
[06:27.260 --> 06:29.340]  I've been growing underground in Illinois
[06:29.340 --> 06:31.320]  until the last couple of years, then took a break.
[06:31.320 --> 06:33.760]  So things have changed for sure.
[06:34.580 --> 06:36.460]  Just to kind of explain what this guy's talking about,
[06:36.460 --> 06:39.540]  he said, I do like your throwback podcasts.
[06:39.540 --> 06:41.580]  On Thursdays, I've been putting out
[06:41.580 --> 06:43.940]  what I call throwback Thursday episodes
[06:43.940 --> 06:45.860]  where I take chunks of old episodes,
[06:45.860 --> 06:47.860]  usually three, four, maybe five episodes,
[06:47.860 --> 06:51.100]  and I put them into one chunk of one file.
[06:51.100 --> 06:53.140]  And then I post that up to iTunes and Stitcher
[06:53.140 --> 06:54.140]  and wherever else it goes.
[06:54.140 --> 06:56.420]  My website, iRegioneticsColorado.com,
[06:56.420 --> 06:58.180]  which that website sucks, you guys.
[06:58.180 --> 06:59.000]  I apologize.
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.260]  The website is kind of a piece of shit.
[07:00.260 --> 07:01.300]  It needs some love.
[07:01.300 --> 07:03.720]  I don't have time or motivation to work on that.
[07:04.220 --> 07:05.040]  I know how the podcast works.
[07:05.040 --> 07:06.680]  That's what we need, so that's there.
[07:06.680 --> 07:11.320]  But I put up the episodes and they're old episodes.
[07:11.320 --> 07:13.440]  iTunes and Stitcher and my website
[07:13.440 --> 07:15.880]  only hold 100 episodes in the feed.
[07:15.880 --> 07:18.960]  We are currently at episode number 221
[07:18.960 --> 07:20.380]  is what I think this is.
[07:20.380 --> 07:22.360]  So that means there are 121 episodes
[07:22.360 --> 07:26.680]  not available to you anywhere that are not in that feed.
[07:26.680 --> 07:28.460]  So I'm putting them out in old chunks.
[07:28.460 --> 07:30.320]  I am also putting them up on YouTube,
[07:30.320 --> 07:31.980]  but that's taking me a little while.
[07:32.020 --> 07:34.820]  I do have the first 60 videos up on YouTube,
[07:34.820 --> 07:36.860]  but I've been putting out the old Throwback Thursday episode
[07:36.860 --> 07:38.420]  so that people can go back and listen to that
[07:38.420 --> 07:40.780]  because there are some great episodes in there.
[07:40.780 --> 07:43.020]  From about episode 50 to about 100,
[07:43.020 --> 07:44.900]  there are some really golden episodes
[07:44.900 --> 07:47.780]  like scheduling a perpetual harvest
[07:47.780 --> 07:49.860]  and just stuff along those lines.
[07:49.860 --> 07:53.500]  Lots of improving harvests and harvest weights,
[07:53.500 --> 07:54.380]  stuff like that.
[07:54.380 --> 07:57.020]  Episode 50 is one of my favorite episodes personally.
[07:57.020 --> 07:59.140]  But those aren't in the feed anymore,
[07:59.140 --> 08:01.880]  so I've been throwing those old episodes back in chunks
[08:02.780 --> 08:03.760]  so that if I put,
[08:03.760 --> 08:05.240]  that way when I put three episodes out,
[08:05.240 --> 08:06.680]  I'm only losing one episode
[08:06.680 --> 08:09.120]  and there are three freshies for somebody to listen to.
[08:09.120 --> 08:11.000]  I'm trying to keep content fresh for you guys.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.120]  And as I'm going, I'm making videos for YouTube.
[08:13.120 --> 08:14.520]  I'm just simply putting
[08:14.520 --> 08:17.000]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo up on the screen
[08:17.000 --> 08:18.880]  and then running the audio in the background.
[08:18.880 --> 08:20.560]  I'm doing very little to the videos.
[08:20.560 --> 08:23.140]  I just wanna get them out there so that they're listenable.
[08:23.140 --> 08:24.560]  I will catch up.
[08:24.560 --> 08:26.320]  Thanks for being patient with me on that.
[08:26.320 --> 08:27.680]  Holy crap, that's a lot of ranting.
[08:27.680 --> 08:30.560]  Let me slap myself in the face and get back focused.
[08:30.560 --> 08:32.340]  You do like the Throwback Thursday podcast.
[08:32.340 --> 08:34.180]  Thank you, because they're kind of a lot of work.
[08:34.180 --> 08:36.240]  It takes my computer a long time to process
[08:36.240 --> 08:37.080]  that big of a file.
[08:37.080 --> 08:38.760]  Putting it together kinda takes me a minute,
[08:38.760 --> 08:40.600]  so I'm glad you appreciate that.
[08:40.600 --> 08:42.720]  They're great for listening while setting up a new grow.
[08:42.720 --> 08:44.760]  Yes, I love listening to podcasts
[08:44.760 --> 08:45.760]  while setting up a new grow.
[08:45.760 --> 08:48.560]  It just helps me get in the zone, I get in the flow.
[08:48.560 --> 08:50.000]  I'm glad you're listening to my show.
[08:50.000 --> 08:51.320]  I appreciate that.
[08:51.320 --> 08:52.840]  You've been growing underground in Illinois
[08:52.840 --> 08:54.040]  until the last couple years,
[08:54.040 --> 08:55.700]  so things have certainly changed.
[08:55.700 --> 08:57.040]  Yes, they have.
[08:57.040 --> 08:58.600]  I hope you get some cool shit going out there.
[08:58.600 --> 09:01.200]  Stay safe, be careful, follow the rules,
[09:01.200 --> 09:03.720]  and then let me know how it goes for you.
[09:03.720 --> 09:05.280]  Then, you do have some questions.
[09:05.280 --> 09:06.360]  Let me get to the first question.
[09:06.360 --> 09:07.620]  It says, just a couple of questions.
[09:07.620 --> 09:09.760]  What are your thoughts on LED setups?
[09:09.760 --> 09:11.740]  I can't recall you talking much about them,
[09:11.740 --> 09:15.440]  or was I two-stoned and missed it, but I'm curious.
[09:15.440 --> 09:16.720]  My thoughts on LED setups.
[09:16.720 --> 09:19.320]  Honestly, I don't have enough personal experience
[09:19.320 --> 09:21.040]  growing under LEDs.
[09:21.040 --> 09:22.920]  I have grown under Govitas.
[09:22.920 --> 09:24.760]  I have grown under T5s.
[09:24.760 --> 09:26.720]  I have grown under high-pressure sodiums.
[09:26.720 --> 09:29.360]  I have grown under metal halides,
[09:29.360 --> 09:34.080]  but I do not have any personal experience with LED lighting.
[09:34.080 --> 09:39.080]  I have seen some amazing crops grown under LED lights.
[09:39.320 --> 09:41.800]  My friend Nancy Budwell is a, was,
[09:41.800 --> 09:42.960]  I'm not sure if she still is.
[09:42.960 --> 09:44.080]  I don't wanna speak out of line,
[09:44.080 --> 09:46.600]  but Nancy Budwell was a rep for lush lighting
[09:46.600 --> 09:48.600]  for quite a while, and her lush lights
[09:48.600 --> 09:50.760]  were putting out very beautiful crops.
[09:50.760 --> 09:53.720]  She's growing some firefly right now under lush lights,
[09:53.720 --> 09:55.280]  and it looks very beautiful.
[09:55.280 --> 09:57.960]  She took some amazing pictures of bounty killer
[09:57.960 --> 09:59.960]  that were grown under her lush lights,
[09:59.960 --> 10:01.320]  and they were gorgeous.
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.080]  So I don't know enough about any specific brands
[10:05.080 --> 10:06.480]  to love or hate them.
[10:06.480 --> 10:09.640]  What I do know is that if you're getting a quality light
[10:09.640 --> 10:11.280]  that's putting out the right lighting,
[10:11.280 --> 10:12.880]  the right colors, the right spectrum,
[10:12.880 --> 10:15.200]  and it's wired properly and it's safe,
[10:15.200 --> 10:17.160]  I have seen some good shit happen.
[10:17.160 --> 10:19.960]  I've also seen people buy cheap, shitty lights,
[10:19.960 --> 10:22.200]  and it just makes their plants look like shit.
[10:22.200 --> 10:24.600]  So I don't know what brands to recommend,
[10:24.600 --> 10:26.360]  but if you can do some research
[10:26.360 --> 10:27.960]  and eliminate the crap brands,
[10:27.960 --> 10:29.840]  you could probably grow a decent crop
[10:29.840 --> 10:32.240]  with an LED light is my opinion.
[10:32.240 --> 10:34.220]  I don't have any firsthand experience,
[10:34.220 --> 10:36.160]  so this is not my area of expertise,
[10:36.160 --> 10:37.600]  but I've seen it done,
[10:37.600 --> 10:39.660]  and I've seen Nancy grow some great herb.
[10:39.660 --> 10:41.520]  I've seen a few other people grow great herb
[10:41.520 --> 10:42.640]  under LED lighting.
[10:42.640 --> 10:43.640]  I just haven't done it.
[10:43.640 --> 10:46.960]  So if you're looking to save money on electricity,
[10:46.960 --> 10:49.200]  on cooling, and if you're just growing for yourself
[10:49.200 --> 10:51.520]  in like a closet or a spare bedroom or something,
[10:51.520 --> 10:53.440]  and you're not trying to do a big production crop
[10:53.440 --> 10:55.160]  to like pay the rent or something,
[10:55.160 --> 10:56.360]  if you're just a medical patient
[10:56.360 --> 10:57.520]  trying to grow your own medicine,
[10:57.520 --> 10:59.240]  an LED should be perfect for you.
[10:59.240 --> 11:01.800]  Two LEDs, one for vegging, one for flowering,
[11:01.800 --> 11:03.840]  you should be right where you need to be.
[11:03.840 --> 11:06.160]  So that's pretty much all I know about LEDs.
[11:06.160 --> 11:08.340]  Is there better for smaller setups?
[11:08.340 --> 11:10.160]  I saw Subcool do a side-by-side.
[11:10.160 --> 11:12.600]  He ran his normal light, his 1000 watt,
[11:12.600 --> 11:14.160]  high pressure sodiums,
[11:14.160 --> 11:16.520]  and then he put an LED in one section of the room,
[11:16.520 --> 11:19.120]  and he said that he had to feed the plants differently
[11:19.120 --> 11:20.280]  that were underneath the LED,
[11:20.280 --> 11:21.440]  which I would believe
[11:21.440 --> 11:24.000]  because they will photosynthesize differently
[11:24.000 --> 11:24.840]  because they are getting
[11:24.840 --> 11:26.280]  completely different spectrums of light.
[11:26.280 --> 11:28.880]  So you may have to change your feeding,
[11:28.880 --> 11:30.600]  and you may have to change your flowering times
[11:30.600 --> 11:32.160]  and your veg times,
[11:32.160 --> 11:34.520]  but it could be beneficial.
[11:34.520 --> 11:36.240]  And that's, I wish I had more info for you,
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.080]  but I've never done it,
[11:37.080 --> 11:38.940]  and I don't wanna talk out of my ass
[11:38.940 --> 11:40.080]  any more than I just did.
[11:40.080 --> 11:41.320]  So question number two,
[11:41.320 --> 11:43.360]  I came across the idea of having a grow
[11:43.360 --> 11:45.600]  that works as a small-scale assembly line,
[11:45.600 --> 11:47.280]  for lack of better term.
[11:47.280 --> 11:51.560]  The general idea is to have 12 to 16 plants total,
[11:51.560 --> 11:54.600]  one for every week a plant is alive.
[11:54.600 --> 11:55.800]  So you wanna have your plants alive
[11:55.800 --> 11:57.420]  for 12 to 16 weeks total,
[11:57.420 --> 11:58.620]  which makes sense.
[11:58.620 --> 12:01.100]  You got about a nine-week flower time,
[12:01.100 --> 12:04.240]  then probably four or five weeks of veg onto that.
[12:04.240 --> 12:05.880]  That's putting you at 14 weeks,
[12:05.880 --> 12:09.080]  and then two more weeks as a clone is 16 weeks.
[12:09.080 --> 12:11.280]  So you can shave off whatever you need to hit your 12,
[12:11.280 --> 12:13.200]  but that's a 16-week plant life,
[12:13.200 --> 12:15.160]  which is acceptable.
[12:15.160 --> 12:17.360]  Then you go on to say planting one every week,
[12:17.360 --> 12:18.720]  harvesting one every week,
[12:18.720 --> 12:21.640]  moving one to veg every week, et cetera.
[12:21.640 --> 12:23.740]  Other than not being able to deep clean,
[12:23.740 --> 12:25.240]  do repairs between cycles,
[12:25.240 --> 12:27.800]  are there any problems with this way of growing?
[12:27.800 --> 12:30.160]  Should I even try something like this?
[12:30.160 --> 12:31.200]  Then you wrap it up by saying,
[12:31.200 --> 12:32.780]  I hope the second question is clear enough.
[12:32.780 --> 12:33.880]  I'm based in Durango,
[12:33.880 --> 12:36.760]  so I hope I can meet you and dab you out sometime.
[12:36.760 --> 12:38.080]  I have way more questions,
[12:38.080 --> 12:41.080]  but I feel bad you have to read my rambles this far.
[12:41.080 --> 12:43.520]  So until next time, Durango.
[12:43.560 --> 12:45.320]  Durango, great question, dude.
[12:45.320 --> 12:47.480]  The question number two right here, I love this.
[12:47.480 --> 12:50.800]  This is a great question, and this is clear.
[12:50.800 --> 12:52.200]  You are very well-spoken.
[12:52.200 --> 12:54.000]  You wouldn't believe some of the emails I get, dude.
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.920]  You wouldn't believe some of the people I speak to.
[12:55.920 --> 12:56.840]  Send me more shit.
[12:56.840 --> 12:57.960]  I like the way you write.
[12:57.960 --> 12:58.980]  I can tolerate you.
[12:58.980 --> 12:59.820]  I want more.
[12:59.820 --> 13:00.640]  Send me more questions.
[13:00.640 --> 13:02.240]  I wanna hear them.
[13:02.240 --> 13:04.280]  Now let me answer your question.
[13:04.280 --> 13:05.800]  Yes, this is a great fucking idea.
[13:05.800 --> 13:08.420]  This is kind of, I run a giant, not a giant.
[13:08.420 --> 13:10.580]  I run a medium-sized commercial grow,
[13:10.580 --> 13:11.540]  and this is the idea.
[13:11.540 --> 13:13.080]  We don't do things every day.
[13:13.600 --> 13:15.440]  We do things in about three-week cycles
[13:15.440 --> 13:16.880]  because we cut down a lot of herb.
[13:16.880 --> 13:19.880]  It takes us an entire week to finish a harvest.
[13:19.880 --> 13:21.960]  We have a whole trim crew come on Friday.
[13:21.960 --> 13:23.520]  They cut down every plant in the room.
[13:23.520 --> 13:26.460]  It's usually, one room is 126 plants.
[13:26.460 --> 13:30.840]  The bigger room is 168 plants or somewhere around there.
[13:30.840 --> 13:33.560]  So between 125 and 170-ish plants
[13:33.560 --> 13:35.440]  is what we cut down at a time.
[13:35.440 --> 13:36.960]  They cut it all down on one day.
[13:36.960 --> 13:38.640]  It hangs upside down.
[13:38.640 --> 13:39.680]  They do that on Friday.
[13:39.680 --> 13:41.960]  Then they come back Monday, usually-ish,
[13:41.960 --> 13:43.760]  or they'll cut down on Monday, come back Friday.
[13:43.760 --> 13:45.180]  Depends on their schedule.
[13:45.180 --> 13:47.160]  We have an outside trim crew that comes.
[13:47.160 --> 13:48.560]  Shout out to the trim crew if you're listening.
[13:48.560 --> 13:50.320]  Thanks for helping us out.
[13:50.320 --> 13:52.800]  They come and they chop it down on Monday.
[13:52.800 --> 13:53.680]  It hangs upside down.
[13:53.680 --> 13:56.040]  Then on Friday, they come and buck all the buds
[13:56.040 --> 13:58.160]  off of the sticks into buckets.
[13:58.160 --> 13:59.320]  And then the next Monday,
[13:59.320 --> 14:01.200]  they come and start trimming it all up.
[14:01.200 --> 14:04.120]  And it usually takes them until Friday to finish.
[14:04.120 --> 14:06.120]  Sometimes on Friday, they get off early,
[14:06.120 --> 14:07.920]  but usually on Friday, it's a scramble
[14:07.920 --> 14:09.540]  to get that last bit of bud trimmed up.
[14:09.980 --> 14:12.460]  It's a 40-hour work week, trimming our weeds.
[14:12.460 --> 14:15.700]  So we only cut down, and we have three flowering rooms.
[14:15.700 --> 14:18.820]  So we cut down about every three weeks is our cycle.
[14:18.820 --> 14:20.140]  So yes, this is what you want.
[14:20.140 --> 14:22.560]  You want to always have things running.
[14:25.100 --> 14:28.260]  I wanna know why do you wanna do one plant constantly
[14:28.260 --> 14:30.620]  instead of having the room come down all at once.
[14:30.620 --> 14:32.140]  That's a thought that I would put into this.
[14:32.140 --> 14:34.620]  And I know why, because I'm a grower and I'm experienced.
[14:34.620 --> 14:37.760]  But I want you to think to yourself why you wanna do this
[14:37.760 --> 14:40.840]  instead of taking down 12 or 16 plants at once
[14:40.840 --> 14:42.600]  and then having a pound of herb
[14:42.600 --> 14:45.880]  as opposed to having an ounce every week.
[14:45.880 --> 14:48.480]  And I get why, because you wanna smoke an ounce a week,
[14:48.480 --> 14:50.360]  and it's easier to trim an ounce every week instead.
[14:50.360 --> 14:51.480]  But you're gonna have,
[14:51.480 --> 14:55.560]  this is gonna create constant work, which is not a bad thing.
[14:55.560 --> 14:57.960]  But if you fuck up, then your rhythm is fucked up.
[14:57.960 --> 15:01.080]  If one clone dies or if one plant goes wrong
[15:01.080 --> 15:02.960]  or if you can't do something right,
[15:02.960 --> 15:04.120]  then you're really screwed.
[15:04.120 --> 15:05.640]  Also, this locks you into a cycle
[15:05.640 --> 15:07.200]  to where you can only grow one strain
[15:07.640 --> 15:08.880]  that fits this program.
[15:08.880 --> 15:10.240]  So this is a good idea, yes.
[15:10.240 --> 15:12.640]  This is kind of the goal for production,
[15:12.640 --> 15:15.320]  to one in, one out constantly.
[15:15.320 --> 15:18.480]  But the way I would recommend, you say 16 plants here,
[15:18.480 --> 15:22.420]  I would do four plants at a time just to keep it,
[15:22.420 --> 15:25.600]  that way you have, then you can put some weeks,
[15:25.600 --> 15:28.180]  a week of space, four weeks of space or something in there,
[15:28.180 --> 15:31.200]  two weeks of space instead of every Monday
[15:31.200 --> 15:32.960]  cutting a clone, cutting a plant down.
[15:32.960 --> 15:36.120]  And it sounds awesome, yes, but it's gonna get tedious
[15:36.160 --> 15:37.400]  and it's gonna get overwhelming.
[15:37.400 --> 15:39.520]  And when it gets tedious and overwhelming,
[15:39.520 --> 15:40.880]  that's when the love comes out of it
[15:40.880 --> 15:42.520]  and it starts becoming a production line.
[15:42.520 --> 15:43.760]  And you wanna keep as much love
[15:43.760 --> 15:45.080]  into growing cannabis as you can.
[15:45.080 --> 15:47.280]  That's something that we overlook.
[15:47.280 --> 15:48.800]  We often see it on baked goods
[15:48.800 --> 15:50.640]  and they print it on a lot of packaging
[15:50.640 --> 15:52.880]  in the dispensaries that this product was made
[15:52.880 --> 15:54.380]  with love and the ingredients.
[15:54.380 --> 15:56.720]  We have to remember to put that into cannabis.
[15:56.720 --> 15:58.460]  If you're smoking cannabis recreationally,
[15:58.460 --> 16:00.600]  if you're smoking cannabis medically,
[16:00.600 --> 16:01.960]  love is a required ingredient.
[16:01.960 --> 16:02.780]  This is a plant.
[16:02.780 --> 16:05.200]  This is something that's growing from a seed, from earth.
[16:05.200 --> 16:06.560]  This has got some earth life energy.
[16:06.560 --> 16:07.600]  No matter what you believe in,
[16:07.600 --> 16:11.220]  this has got some connection to you somehow
[16:11.220 --> 16:12.480]  and you gotta put love into it.
[16:12.480 --> 16:14.640]  Anything that you put love into grows better.
[16:14.640 --> 16:16.360]  Anything you nourish properly grows better.
[16:16.360 --> 16:18.480]  And then I think it's better to,
[16:18.480 --> 16:20.920]  if you're smoking recreationally, you're medicating
[16:20.920 --> 16:22.640]  because you feel better.
[16:22.640 --> 16:26.260]  And even if it's just to make your mind smile
[16:26.260 --> 16:28.640]  and make your, that's a medical treatment
[16:29.800 --> 16:31.500]  because it's a relief in some way.
[16:32.960 --> 16:34.560]  It's relief in my opinion.
[16:34.880 --> 16:36.880]  It needs to be nourished as a medical product
[16:36.880 --> 16:39.320]  or as a product that we're going to put into our bodies
[16:39.320 --> 16:41.720]  and it will medicate us better.
[16:41.720 --> 16:43.520]  You need to treat your plants with love.
[16:43.520 --> 16:46.760]  And I think if you have too much of a production,
[16:46.760 --> 16:48.760]  the love kind of falls out.
[16:48.760 --> 16:50.920]  And I may be a fucking hippie for thinking that
[16:50.920 --> 16:51.760]  and that's cool.
[16:51.760 --> 16:53.560]  Maybe you don't believe that there needs to be love
[16:53.560 --> 16:54.400]  in your plants.
[16:54.400 --> 16:55.240]  I'm not singling you out.
[16:55.240 --> 16:56.960]  I'm not saying, maybe other people don't believe
[16:56.960 --> 16:57.800]  there needs to be love.
[16:57.800 --> 17:01.920]  Maybe I've got a good friend who,
[17:01.920 --> 17:03.200]  I'll see him tomorrow afternoon.
[17:03.400 --> 17:04.920]  He doesn't love the plants.
[17:04.920 --> 17:06.980]  He knows that that's a production line.
[17:06.980 --> 17:10.480]  This is a product and he's going to grow this product.
[17:10.480 --> 17:11.320]  It's a commodity.
[17:11.320 --> 17:12.160]  We will cut it down.
[17:12.160 --> 17:12.980]  We will sell it.
[17:12.980 --> 17:13.820]  We will do more.
[17:13.820 --> 17:14.640]  He doesn't love the plants.
[17:14.640 --> 17:15.480]  I love the plants.
[17:16.400 --> 17:17.440]  I feel like it's something he should do.
[17:17.440 --> 17:19.280]  Sorry, I might get sidetracked because I love the plants.
[17:19.280 --> 17:21.820]  But yes, so your idea is perfect,
[17:21.820 --> 17:24.160]  but I would do, instead of doing 16 plants
[17:24.160 --> 17:25.500]  and doing one every week,
[17:25.500 --> 17:28.920]  I would kind of break it down into four in, four out.
[17:28.920 --> 17:32.320]  That way you can get three weeks of not having to trim
[17:32.360 --> 17:34.520]  because if you're going to have to trim one plant every week
[17:34.520 --> 17:37.280]  and then you're going to have one plant curing
[17:37.280 --> 17:38.760]  that's been in the jar for a little bit,
[17:38.760 --> 17:40.200]  you're going to have to burp that jar.
[17:40.200 --> 17:42.420]  And I don't know how big your plants are going to be,
[17:42.420 --> 17:44.080]  but it's going to be a lot of work.
[17:44.080 --> 17:45.840]  It's going to be a lot of excess work.
[17:45.840 --> 17:46.680]  If you chop things,
[17:46.680 --> 17:50.400]  the harvesting things in larger batches is just easier
[17:50.400 --> 17:52.800]  for burping and stuff like that.
[17:52.800 --> 17:54.600]  But I'm not trying to shoot down your idea.
[17:54.600 --> 17:57.620]  If you are dedicated and you think you want to do that,
[17:57.620 --> 17:59.800]  if you don't have another job
[17:59.800 --> 18:01.400]  and if you don't have a busy life,
[18:01.400 --> 18:02.520]  this would be fucking awesome for you.
[18:02.520 --> 18:04.040]  This would not work for me.
[18:04.040 --> 18:07.240]  I am way too busy to chop down a plant every week,
[18:07.240 --> 18:08.660]  cut a clone every week.
[18:08.660 --> 18:11.640]  It just seems tedious to me, but that is the idea.
[18:11.640 --> 18:13.680]  What you're getting at is ultimately the idea.
[18:13.680 --> 18:16.160]  There are large grows in Colorado
[18:16.160 --> 18:18.200]  that work on basically this plan.
[18:18.200 --> 18:19.800]  They put, but they do it every week.
[18:19.800 --> 18:22.240]  Every Monday, plants go in and plants come down.
[18:22.240 --> 18:24.400]  Every Monday, plants go in, plants come down.
[18:24.400 --> 18:26.240]  And that's, there's just, and you're all right.
[18:26.240 --> 18:28.920]  The only downside to it is not being able to deep clean
[18:28.920 --> 18:31.840]  and do repairs, but there's nothing stopping you
[18:31.840 --> 18:33.720]  from pulling every plant out of that room
[18:33.720 --> 18:34.920]  or over to one side of the room
[18:34.920 --> 18:36.320]  and cleaning the shit out of where you can
[18:36.320 --> 18:37.840]  and then move the plants the other side of the room,
[18:37.840 --> 18:39.480]  clean the shit out of where you can.
[18:39.480 --> 18:43.040]  Or you've got 12 hours during a flowering cycle.
[18:43.040 --> 18:45.320]  You should be able to do just about any kind of repairs
[18:45.320 --> 18:47.880]  you need to do during a 12 hour cycle.
[18:47.880 --> 18:48.760]  That's my opinion.
[18:48.760 --> 18:49.800]  I don't know.
[18:49.800 --> 18:51.920]  I don't know how physically able you are
[18:51.920 --> 18:53.600]  or what kind of work skills you've got,
[18:53.600 --> 18:54.680]  but most stuff that needs to be done
[18:54.680 --> 18:56.400]  in there cleaning wise, you can take down.
[18:56.400 --> 18:57.680]  I have taken down an entire room.
[18:57.680 --> 19:00.320]  Mike and I have taken down every bit of ducting,
[19:00.320 --> 19:02.520]  every light, pulled out the flooring,
[19:02.520 --> 19:04.480]  redid the flooring in the room.
[19:04.480 --> 19:06.400]  We actually painted the whole room with kills,
[19:06.400 --> 19:07.360]  redid all the ducting.
[19:07.360 --> 19:08.920]  We did it all in 12 hours.
[19:08.920 --> 19:10.480]  Those plants didn't skip a day.
[19:10.480 --> 19:12.480]  They didn't miss a minute of their night cycle.
[19:12.480 --> 19:13.820]  They were all back on the right cycle.
[19:13.820 --> 19:15.960]  So I think it can be done just about
[19:15.960 --> 19:16.920]  however big the room is.
[19:16.920 --> 19:18.120]  You may need a friend.
[19:18.120 --> 19:18.960]  You just got to dedicate.
[19:18.960 --> 19:21.160]  And if you're down to do this fucking
[19:21.160 --> 19:23.580]  16 plants every 16 weeks idea,
[19:23.580 --> 19:25.520]  you gotta be down to clean and do stuff like that.
[19:25.520 --> 19:27.080]  It sounds like you're a savage.
[19:27.440 --> 19:29.280]  Durango, whenever you're up in the Pueblo area,
[19:29.280 --> 19:31.480]  or if you're in Denver or Colorado Springs,
[19:31.480 --> 19:32.960]  hit me up, I'd love to dab with you.
[19:32.960 --> 19:34.780]  I go to a lot of comedy shows and stuff like that.
[19:34.780 --> 19:36.320]  So if you're going to comedy shows,
[19:36.320 --> 19:39.160]  if you're going to any of the fish shows, bro,
[19:39.160 --> 19:40.720]  it sounds like you might be going to fish.
[19:40.720 --> 19:43.640]  A lot of folks from Durango come up to see fish.
[19:43.640 --> 19:45.240]  Look for me, hit me up.
[19:45.240 --> 19:46.440]  We'll take some dabs together.
[19:46.440 --> 19:47.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure you can hear my throat
[19:47.800 --> 19:48.980]  doing that thing where it's getting dry.
[19:48.980 --> 19:50.360]  I'm gonna press pause for,
[19:50.360 --> 19:51.720]  well, I'm gonna pause for several minutes.
[19:51.720 --> 19:52.740]  I'm gonna take a couple of dabs.
[19:52.740 --> 19:54.160]  I'm gonna drink some water.
[19:54.160 --> 19:55.040]  And then I'll be right back
[19:55.040 --> 19:56.760]  and we will read some more emails.
[19:57.720 --> 20:05.030]  Yeah, I am back, podcast world.
[20:05.030 --> 20:05.870]  Guess what?
[20:05.870 --> 20:06.990]  My head is vibrating.
[20:06.990 --> 20:07.990]  Ooh, yeah.
[20:07.990 --> 20:10.010]  I just took a big old gigantic dab
[20:10.010 --> 20:12.310]  of some lemon skunk,
[20:12.310 --> 20:16.790]  dunked in Lemon Jeffrey high terpene full spectrum extracts.
[20:16.790 --> 20:19.950]  And it tastes like I just ate an entire...
[20:19.950 --> 20:22.550]  So if you took the powdered sugar stuff off of a lemon head,
[20:22.550 --> 20:24.750]  just the lemon candy flavor,
[20:24.750 --> 20:26.670]  and just concentrated that into one bite,
[20:26.670 --> 20:28.550]  like the whole, the powder from one bag,
[20:28.550 --> 20:30.510]  it tastes like I just ate that much of that flavor.
[20:31.090 --> 20:32.270]  It's strong on my tongue.
[20:32.270 --> 20:33.450]  All I can taste is lemons
[20:33.450 --> 20:36.030]  and there's like this real smooth flavor.
[20:36.030 --> 20:38.350]  I really enjoyed that, but God, that is intense.
[20:38.350 --> 20:39.390]  Holy crap.
[20:39.390 --> 20:40.350]  I was talking to the friend today
[20:40.350 --> 20:44.870]  and we all agree that lemon and limonene stuff
[20:44.870 --> 20:45.870]  and lemon flavored terps
[20:45.870 --> 20:47.310]  are really good for your head injuries.
[20:47.310 --> 20:48.830]  So if you've got a head injury, you guys,
[20:48.830 --> 20:52.130]  we can all recommend the limonene and lemony terps.
[20:53.030 --> 20:54.150]  That just makes my head feel better.
[20:54.150 --> 20:56.550]  I talked about that on a recent episode,
[20:56.550 --> 20:57.550]  but somebody else agreed with me.
[20:57.550 --> 20:59.030]  All right, I'm gonna get my shit together.
[20:59.070 --> 21:01.750]  I was just talking about the email
[21:01.750 --> 21:03.450]  from our friend Derengro.
[21:03.450 --> 21:04.290]  Thanks for the email.
[21:04.290 --> 21:05.550]  If you guys wanna email me, send me an email,
[21:05.550 --> 21:06.990]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[21:06.990 --> 21:08.910]  I wanna answer your grow questions.
[21:08.910 --> 21:12.590]  But I wanna remind you that I think it was episode number 73
[21:12.590 --> 21:15.470]  was all about scheduling a perpetual grow.
[21:15.470 --> 21:18.090]  And it was basically what you were talking about,
[21:18.090 --> 21:21.670]  but it was using a five by five flowering space
[21:21.670 --> 21:24.030]  and another five by five space to feed that,
[21:24.030 --> 21:27.150]  to pull down one plant every four weeks
[21:27.150 --> 21:28.310]  is what I think I was doing.
[21:28.350 --> 21:30.590]  Unfortunately, that episode is not in the feed
[21:30.590 --> 21:32.210]  because like I rambled about earlier,
[21:32.210 --> 21:35.070]  iTunes and Stitcher only hold 100 episodes,
[21:35.070 --> 21:38.270]  but I am very close to getting that up on iTunes.
[21:38.270 --> 21:40.830]  So bear with me and within the next few weeks here,
[21:40.830 --> 21:42.390]  we'll get that up on iTunes
[21:42.390 --> 21:44.270]  and everyone can listen to the scheduling
[21:44.270 --> 21:47.210]  a perpetual grow episode.
[21:47.210 --> 21:49.350]  All right, I've got another email here on my phone.
[21:49.350 --> 21:51.670]  This one I found very interesting.
[21:51.670 --> 21:54.230]  A few episodes ago, I spoke of my head injury.
[21:54.230 --> 21:56.830]  I don't wanna ramble on about it right now for too long,
[21:56.830 --> 21:58.830]  but about two and a half years ago,
[21:58.830 --> 22:00.350]  I suffered a traumatic brain injury.
[22:00.350 --> 22:02.970]  I'm six foot five and I walked through a doorway
[22:02.970 --> 22:04.910]  that apparently was six foot two
[22:04.910 --> 22:06.630]  and it knocked me the fuck out.
[22:06.630 --> 22:07.490]  I don't remember hitting.
[22:07.490 --> 22:09.510]  I remember thinking, I need to go get a chair
[22:09.510 --> 22:10.990]  that's at the bottom of those stairs.
[22:10.990 --> 22:11.990]  And then I remember,
[22:13.150 --> 22:14.510]  kind of sounded like a cymbal crash,
[22:14.510 --> 22:15.710]  maybe a little bit of lightning,
[22:15.710 --> 22:17.350]  maybe a tailgate of a truck slamming.
[22:17.350 --> 22:18.910]  And I remember being at the bottom of the stairs
[22:18.910 --> 22:20.750]  and all my friends saying my name.
[22:20.750 --> 22:22.230]  And I was like, what?
[22:22.230 --> 22:23.430]  Why the fuck do you keep saying my name?
[22:23.430 --> 22:25.350]  And then I was like, why am I on the floor?
[22:25.350 --> 22:26.350]  I fucked myself up.
[22:26.870 --> 22:28.310]  I knocked myself, clean the fuck out.
[22:28.310 --> 22:31.170]  I was not right for a long time.
[22:31.170 --> 22:32.990]  I spoke about it on a recent podcast.
[22:32.990 --> 22:34.470]  I don't need to go too far into it right here,
[22:34.470 --> 22:36.190]  but I'm much better now, much better.
[22:36.190 --> 22:38.230]  I feel like I'm way better now.
[22:38.230 --> 22:40.550]  I ramble a lot now, but I feel like I'm way better.
[22:40.550 --> 22:43.550]  Anyway, a listener wanted to email me
[22:43.550 --> 22:46.630]  and I found this to be a very great email.
[22:46.630 --> 22:48.350]  It goes like this, Rasta Jeff,
[22:48.350 --> 22:51.430]  I heard your podcast on TBI and what happened to you?
[22:51.430 --> 22:52.890]  Much love, bro.
[22:52.890 --> 22:55.350]  I suffer from chronic PTSD
[22:55.350 --> 22:58.490]  and my doctor suggested I try THC.
[22:58.490 --> 23:01.550]  It has changed my life and my outlook on it.
[23:01.550 --> 23:03.750]  Your podcast puts a positive note
[23:03.750 --> 23:06.830]  to the change we all want to see.
[23:06.830 --> 23:08.670]  So far so good, right, you guys?
[23:09.870 --> 23:13.390]  This guy suffers from chronic PTSD.
[23:13.390 --> 23:15.990]  I've got a little bit of PTSD from,
[23:15.990 --> 23:19.070]  I had a friend who discovered they had a seizure disorder.
[23:19.070 --> 23:20.350]  She wasn't my friend, she was my girlfriend.
[23:20.350 --> 23:21.990]  I lived with her and we discovered
[23:21.990 --> 23:24.070]  that she had a seizure disorder
[23:24.070 --> 23:27.110]  and her seizures were fucking horrible
[23:27.110 --> 23:30.470]  and I wasn't prepared to live with that
[23:30.470 --> 23:31.590]  at that time in my life.
[23:31.590 --> 23:33.830]  And I watched that person have some serious
[23:33.830 --> 23:35.990]  medical problems and it fucked me up.
[23:35.990 --> 23:38.550]  I don't think I've ever talked about that on a podcast,
[23:38.550 --> 23:40.630]  but I've got some PTSD from watching
[23:41.790 --> 23:45.350]  a girlfriend from my past have grand mal seizures
[23:45.350 --> 23:47.150]  and nearly die multiple times.
[23:47.150 --> 23:50.550]  So I've got some PTSD and I believe that the THC
[23:50.550 --> 23:53.990]  kinda, it doesn't allow those shitty thoughts to come up
[23:54.830 --> 23:55.670]  when they do.
[23:55.670 --> 23:57.390]  And I know that's a shitty way to cover your problems,
[23:57.390 --> 24:00.670]  but it does kinda, the PTSD triggers weird shit
[24:00.670 --> 24:02.310]  and it makes other emotions start going
[24:02.310 --> 24:04.590]  and it gives you more things and it stops that.
[24:04.590 --> 24:06.110]  So I agree that it does work.
[24:06.110 --> 24:08.310]  It does change your life and I'm glad
[24:08.310 --> 24:10.070]  that it changed your outlook on it.
[24:10.070 --> 24:13.350]  And dude, I am glad that my podcast puts a positive note
[24:13.350 --> 24:15.150]  because that's what I try to do.
[24:15.150 --> 24:17.070]  I try to be a good ambassador for this plant.
[24:17.070 --> 24:18.350]  So that means a lot to me.
[24:18.350 --> 24:20.310]  Here's the part of the email that everybody
[24:20.310 --> 24:23.310]  is gonna go, wow, because I really did.
[24:23.310 --> 24:26.350]  This listener says, I am a former law enforcement officer
[24:26.350 --> 24:28.790]  and never thought I would be using THC.
[24:28.790 --> 24:32.310]  So sad to know how ignorant I was for all those years.
[24:32.310 --> 24:36.990]  Thank God I found cannabis and added it to my daily life.
[24:36.990 --> 24:39.430]  Dude, I am very grateful that you have found cannabis
[24:39.430 --> 24:40.670]  and added it to your daily life.
[24:40.670 --> 24:42.990]  It's helping with your PTSD.
[24:42.990 --> 24:44.550]  It helped me with my head injury.
[24:44.550 --> 24:46.410]  It helped a couple of guys I was talking to today
[24:46.410 --> 24:47.630]  with their head injuries.
[24:47.630 --> 24:49.750]  It is helping a lot of people take care of their heads
[24:49.750 --> 24:51.390]  and manage their head problems.
[24:51.390 --> 24:53.710]  So I'm glad you found it.
[24:53.710 --> 24:57.950]  What I wanna know is, are you sharing any information
[24:57.950 --> 25:00.990]  with your fellow law enforcement friends?
[25:00.990 --> 25:03.790]  It says that you are a former law enforcement officer.
[25:03.790 --> 25:07.110]  So if you've got people that are still in law enforcement,
[25:07.110 --> 25:09.390]  still active, are you doing anything
[25:09.390 --> 25:12.470]  to kind of educate them a little bit?
[25:12.470 --> 25:15.710]  Are you doing it, are you sharing, is your cannabis use,
[25:15.710 --> 25:18.910]  your THC use, is this public knowledge with anybody?
[25:18.910 --> 25:21.910]  Does your family know, do your loved ones know,
[25:21.910 --> 25:23.290]  do your colleagues know?
[25:23.290 --> 25:24.750]  I kinda wanna know.
[25:24.750 --> 25:26.550]  And if this is too much, I won't share
[25:26.550 --> 25:27.490]  on the podcast or anything.
[25:27.490 --> 25:28.510]  Send me an email and let me know,
[25:28.510 --> 25:31.510]  how are you using the THC to control your PTSD
[25:31.510 --> 25:34.010]  is one thing I'd like to know, not control, but help.
[25:34.010 --> 25:36.350]  And then how public and or private
[25:36.350 --> 25:38.630]  are you about your cannabis use?
[25:38.630 --> 25:42.930]  And would you maybe share my podcast
[25:42.930 --> 25:45.350]  with some of your law enforcement colleagues
[25:45.350 --> 25:48.830]  so that we could show them that we aren't all just potheads
[25:49.670 --> 25:50.510]  trying to smoke to get high,
[25:50.510 --> 25:52.070]  to giggle and watch Cheech and Chong,
[25:52.070 --> 25:54.950]  that a lot of us have medical conditions
[25:54.950 --> 25:58.050]  that without cannabis, we wouldn't be able to function
[25:58.050 --> 25:59.270]  and have a daily life.
[25:59.270 --> 26:02.070]  And I don't say that lightly.
[26:02.070 --> 26:02.950]  I am a caregiver.
[26:02.950 --> 26:05.790]  I provide medical cannabis for a couple of people
[26:05.790 --> 26:08.010]  that I don't know if one guy would still be here
[26:08.010 --> 26:09.270]  if he didn't smoke.
[26:09.270 --> 26:12.350]  I don't know how I would be able to handle my brain injury
[26:12.350 --> 26:14.270]  if I didn't have cannabis available to me.
[26:14.270 --> 26:16.710]  I don't know how your PTSD would treat your life
[26:16.710 --> 26:18.570]  if you didn't find THC.
[26:19.310 --> 26:20.490]  Things may be drastically different
[26:20.490 --> 26:23.010]  if we didn't have a little THC in our lives.
[26:23.010 --> 26:25.690]  So maybe you could share my show
[26:25.690 --> 26:27.370]  with your law enforcement friends.
[26:27.370 --> 26:28.850]  Or I don't know if you wanna do that
[26:28.850 --> 26:30.050]  because you don't wanna out yourself,
[26:30.050 --> 26:30.890]  but you've already,
[26:30.890 --> 26:32.810]  you are no longer a law enforcement officer.
[26:32.810 --> 26:34.970]  So I mean, they aren't gonna fire you.
[26:34.970 --> 26:36.930]  I'm just trying to, maybe you can share this for us
[26:36.930 --> 26:38.970]  and spread the word with us and you're on our team now.
[26:38.970 --> 26:41.370]  So help us out if you can, I appreciate it.
[26:41.370 --> 26:44.290]  It's always great to hear people change
[26:44.290 --> 26:47.090]  and come to the green side from the dark side.
[26:47.090 --> 26:48.570]  I just made that up.
[26:48.570 --> 26:51.930]  Anyway, I hope THC keeps your PTSD under control
[26:51.930 --> 26:55.970]  and I look forward to hearing more from you.
[26:55.970 --> 26:57.250]  Thanks for the email.
[26:57.250 --> 26:58.850]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure I've said it a lot of times.
[26:58.850 --> 27:00.850]  If you wanna email me, it's growfromyourheart
[27:00.850 --> 27:02.330]  at hotmail.com.
[27:02.330 --> 27:04.570]  I would love to hear from you.
[27:04.570 --> 27:06.090]  All right, I've got one more thing I wanna rant about
[27:06.090 --> 27:06.990]  just for a couple of seconds
[27:06.990 --> 27:09.810]  before I start wrapping up the podcast.
[27:09.810 --> 27:11.710]  If there's something in your grow room
[27:11.710 --> 27:14.050]  that you can do today, do it today.
[27:14.050 --> 27:15.650]  If there's some cleaning up that can be done,
[27:15.650 --> 27:17.050]  if there's some improving that can be done,
[27:17.890 --> 27:18.730]  if there's some straightening,
[27:18.730 --> 27:20.730]  if there's a small mess that you need to wipe up,
[27:20.730 --> 27:23.530]  if you can do it today, do it today.
[27:23.530 --> 27:25.290]  Don't push some stuff off for tomorrow
[27:25.290 --> 27:27.090]  that can be done today
[27:27.090 --> 27:30.330]  because there's gonna be some other shit tomorrow to handle.
[27:30.330 --> 27:32.930]  One thing I teach the guys when I hire new people
[27:32.930 --> 27:35.230]  or when I train people at a commercial grow,
[27:35.230 --> 27:37.170]  I always teach them that the first thing you get to do
[27:37.170 --> 27:40.010]  when you walk in is play a game called find the surprise.
[27:41.770 --> 27:44.050]  Commercial grows cost millions of dollars,
[27:44.050 --> 27:46.690]  but for some reason, there's always a little fuck up.
[27:47.330 --> 27:49.530]  It doesn't seem to matter how much money you spend,
[27:49.530 --> 27:53.370]  how much you prepare, something goes wrong randomly
[27:53.370 --> 27:54.450]  overnight when you're gone.
[27:54.450 --> 27:55.510]  It always happens when you're gone.
[27:55.510 --> 27:56.350]  If you watch the cameras,
[27:56.350 --> 27:57.650]  it always happens right when you leave.
[27:57.650 --> 27:58.930]  You lock the door and then click,
[27:58.930 --> 28:00.350]  something goes fucking wrong
[28:00.350 --> 28:02.490]  and you don't notice it until you get there 12 hours later.
[28:02.490 --> 28:04.330]  You walk in at seven or eight in the morning
[28:04.330 --> 28:06.290]  and there's 50 gallons of water in the floor
[28:06.290 --> 28:08.830]  or something weird happened
[28:08.830 --> 28:10.050]  that you never would have foreseen,
[28:10.050 --> 28:11.110]  you never could have predicted,
[28:11.110 --> 28:12.610]  but now you've got to deal with it.
[28:12.610 --> 28:15.250]  So always keep in mind that there's gonna be shit
[28:15.250 --> 28:17.490]  popping up tomorrow that you're not prepared to deal with.
[28:17.490 --> 28:19.730]  So clean up, do whatever you can today.
[28:19.730 --> 28:21.770]  If you're gonna defoliate, defoliate today.
[28:21.770 --> 28:23.370]  If you could trellis, trellis today.
[28:23.370 --> 28:24.870]  Don't wait until tomorrow
[28:24.870 --> 28:27.810]  because tomorrow's going to have its own fucked up surprises.
[28:27.810 --> 28:29.830]  Knock shit out, get it out of the way,
[28:29.830 --> 28:31.730]  do what you need to do early
[28:31.730 --> 28:33.650]  and then you can just kick back and relax.
[28:33.650 --> 28:35.410]  If you let shit wait until tomorrow,
[28:35.410 --> 28:36.850]  that means you're probably gonna let something else
[28:36.850 --> 28:39.330]  wait until tomorrow, which means you got tomorrow's work
[28:39.330 --> 28:41.210]  plus that shit you waited for
[28:41.210 --> 28:42.490]  and then you're not gonna get it all done.
[28:42.490 --> 28:44.850]  So now that shit's gonna fall onto Wednesday
[28:45.490 --> 28:46.330]  and now Wednesday's gonna fucking suck
[28:46.330 --> 28:49.970]  because you've got Monday's work fell onto Tuesday,
[28:49.970 --> 28:51.570]  Tuesday's work fell into Wednesday,
[28:51.570 --> 28:53.190]  now you're doubled up on Wednesday.
[28:53.190 --> 28:54.390]  Now instead of getting off at five,
[28:54.390 --> 28:56.030]  you're not gonna get off till six
[28:56.030 --> 28:57.970]  and then fucking Thursday already sucks.
[28:57.970 --> 28:59.450]  So just do the shit you can do.
[28:59.450 --> 29:02.010]  Get it done, have it done
[29:02.010 --> 29:03.290]  and then when Friday and Saturday come,
[29:03.290 --> 29:04.130]  it's kicking at time.
[29:04.130 --> 29:06.110]  You don't have to worry so much.
[29:06.110 --> 29:07.010]  That's my advice.
[29:07.010 --> 29:08.050]  If you can get it done today,
[29:08.050 --> 29:09.570]  get in there and get it done today
[29:09.570 --> 29:12.410]  because tomorrow, tomorrow you never know.
[29:12.410 --> 29:15.050]  I'm the manager, the facility manager,
[29:15.050 --> 29:17.850]  the cultivation manager, the cult leader at my grow
[29:17.850 --> 29:19.450]  and if a contractor shows up,
[29:19.450 --> 29:21.930]  I have to follow them around and talk to them.
[29:21.930 --> 29:23.970]  If the MED shows up,
[29:23.970 --> 29:26.610]  I'm the one that has to follow them around and talk to them.
[29:26.610 --> 29:29.290]  When the consultants come, when the investors come,
[29:29.290 --> 29:31.530]  when the owners come, that's right.
[29:31.530 --> 29:33.410]  I follow them around and talk to them.
[29:33.410 --> 29:36.370]  So if I've got some work planned for tomorrow
[29:36.370 --> 29:38.390]  and I stacked up too much shit for myself
[29:38.390 --> 29:40.850]  and one ring of the doorbell happens,
[29:40.850 --> 29:42.370]  my whole day can be jumbled
[29:43.290 --> 29:45.610]  and I'm not gonna have time to do what I wanna do
[29:45.610 --> 29:47.930]  and if I saved something from yesterday for today,
[29:47.930 --> 29:50.290]  I'm certainly not gonna have time to do it.
[29:50.290 --> 29:52.730]  All right, I feel like I reiterated and reiterated
[29:52.730 --> 29:53.990]  that rambly point.
[29:53.990 --> 29:55.210]  Just get shit done.
[29:55.210 --> 29:56.610]  Don't hesitate, don't wait.
[29:56.610 --> 29:58.490]  The plants aren't gonna wait for you.
[29:58.490 --> 30:00.170]  Don't fucking wait, don't be lazy.
[30:00.170 --> 30:01.050]  You're growing herb, man.
[30:01.050 --> 30:02.210]  It's one of the best jobs you can have.
[30:02.210 --> 30:03.290]  You're growing cannabis.
[30:03.290 --> 30:05.690]  Get in there and do your best every day.
[30:05.690 --> 30:07.250]  Should I should just drop the mic at that, right?
[30:07.250 --> 30:08.570]  Get in there and do your best every day.
[30:08.570 --> 30:09.850]  Thud, mic drop, gone home.
[30:09.850 --> 30:11.210]  See you next episode.
[30:11.210 --> 30:12.030]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[30:12.030 --> 30:13.450]  I really am gonna wrap up the podcast.
[30:13.450 --> 30:16.090]  I wanna thank you guys for listening to another episode.

[30:18.610 --> 30:19.450]  from your heart.
[30:19.450 --> 30:21.090]  I would love it if you could help out the podcast.
[30:21.090 --> 30:23.730]  Patreon is a service that allows you as a listener
[30:23.730 --> 30:24.970]  to contribute to the show.
[30:24.970 --> 30:27.690]  What that does is helps me pay for my web hosting,
[30:27.690 --> 30:29.170]  helps me pay for these little foam covers
[30:29.170 --> 30:30.250]  that go over my microphone,
[30:30.250 --> 30:32.930]  helps me pay for my high-speed internet connection

[30:57.090 --> 30:58.290]  I would love to hear from you.
[30:58.290 --> 31:00.610]  Also, there is a YouTube channel.
[31:00.610 --> 31:03.730]  The first 60 episodes are up on YouTube now.

[31:08.450 --> 31:09.330]  Go leave some comments.
[31:09.330 --> 31:10.290]  Get the comments started.
[31:10.290 --> 31:11.490]  It only takes one or two comments
[31:11.490 --> 31:13.410]  and then everybody wants to speak their opinion.
[31:13.410 --> 31:14.410]  We'll get a bunch of trolls in there.
[31:14.410 --> 31:16.970]  The more trolls, the more comments, the more views.
[31:16.970 --> 31:18.290]  That'll just get the page moving.
[31:18.290 --> 31:19.650]  That's what we need for right now.
[31:19.650 --> 31:22.210]  Get some people noticing the podcast up there on YouTube.
[31:22.210 --> 31:24.010]  That will inspire me to get more videos out
[31:24.010 --> 31:27.010]  and then hopefully I'll get caught up before too long.
[31:27.010 --> 31:27.890]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[31:27.890 --> 31:29.250]  if you'd like to sponsor the podcast
[31:29.250 --> 31:30.990]  or if you've got a product you would like me to review
[31:30.990 --> 31:32.790]  live on the show, send me an email.
[31:32.790 --> 31:34.610]  Once again, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[31:34.610 --> 31:36.650]  I would love to check out your product.
[31:36.650 --> 31:38.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is all I've got for you this week.
[31:38.730 --> 31:40.090]  I'll be back Thursday with another
