[01:35.490 --> 01:37.090]  discord channel.
[01:37.090 --> 01:41.610]  I will admit I'm not on the discord channel very often there's a lot going on on discord
[01:41.610 --> 01:46.170]  it's a lot for my eyes to follow for my brain to follow on a phone screen so I don't do
[01:46.170 --> 01:50.210]  discord as much as I should I could be there more honestly I'm not there often but those
[01:50.210 --> 01:54.890]  three gentlemen I just mentioned before they run the IRI Genetics the IRI Army the Grow
[01:55.070 --> 01:59.570]  from your heart basically everything RostageF involved they run the discord channel for
[01:59.570 --> 02:04.730]  me and they have recently done a few upgrades several people have done have given some financial
[02:04.730 --> 02:09.490]  contributions to upgrade the discord server thank you guys I appreciate that I will be
[02:09.490 --> 02:13.290]  there more often if you're gonna make it fancy and special I need to show up if you're gonna
[02:13.290 --> 02:17.690]  do that I need to be there I wanted to make sure to stop and do a big shout out to the
[02:17.690 --> 02:23.850]  gentlemen who made it happen Greybeard, Lemur, and Stabby and also excuse me also send a
[02:23.850 --> 02:28.730]  big thank you to everybody who contributed financially to the discord and also a big
[02:28.730 --> 02:34.410]  thanks to everybody who just hangs out joins mingles whatever you do on discord thank you
[02:34.410 --> 02:40.290]  for being there thank you for being a part of the IRI Genetics discord channel discord
[02:40.290 --> 02:44.890]  feed discord link whatever you hip kids want to call it I'm glad you're there I'll be there
[02:44.890 --> 02:49.950]  more often alright let's quit rambling because I can do that all damn night you guys know
[02:49.950 --> 02:54.230]  that let's jump into the email portion of this episode I've got a message here from
[02:54.230 --> 02:59.670]  patreon from a person who would rather not be identified their question goes just like
[02:59.670 --> 03:04.070]  this we'll jump right into it with hey mr. RostageF I got a mr. RostageF out of you
[03:04.070 --> 03:09.870]  that's great this is my first attempt at growing out a male plant for pollen collection that
[03:09.870 --> 03:15.110]  is always a fun project I love growing out male plants I love doing a male pheno hunt
[03:15.110 --> 03:19.350]  when I'm searching for a male plant to breed with I will grow out packs of seeds and I'll
[03:19.350 --> 03:24.150]  find the female out of there just like you guys do but I will also find a stellar amazing
[03:24.150 --> 03:28.910]  keeper male out of there I will flower out my male plants sometimes I'll flower them
[03:28.910 --> 03:33.270]  out to like week 9 or 10 just to see exactly what they do I want to see what the bud structure
[03:33.270 --> 03:38.670]  looks like see how they react to some abuse some problems some issues check out aromas
[03:38.670 --> 03:43.110]  and flavors look for colors see how things change over time when I'm growing those males
[03:43.110 --> 03:47.950]  I love to do a nice male pheno hunt so let's read more of this message it says it is my
[03:47.950 --> 03:53.550]  understanding that a male plant will bloom just like a female plant should cycle so I'm
[03:53.550 --> 03:59.070]  going to switch to 12 12 and wait that is exactly what you need to do the male plants
[03:59.070 --> 04:03.790]  work just like the female plants they are photosynthetic photosensitive just like the
[04:03.790 --> 04:07.430]  female plants it's the same plant you just got boys and girls so yes once you put them
[04:07.430 --> 04:12.950]  under 12 12 about 10 14 maybe 17 days later you will definitely see that that plant is
[04:12.950 --> 04:18.990]  in flower it will start producing pollen you are collecting pollen right yeah so you're
[04:18.990 --> 04:23.630]  going to I would recommend that before you put it into flower you have something in place
[04:23.630 --> 04:28.030]  to start collecting the pollen maybe if you've got a big piece of glass you can set that
[04:28.030 --> 04:32.230]  plant on put the pot right on a big piece of glass and let the pollen rain down on the
[04:32.230 --> 04:37.990]  glass that works some people will take the pot and build you take a paper plate and cut
[04:37.990 --> 04:41.230]  a slit down the middle and then you wrap that around the base of the plant and the pollen
[04:41.230 --> 04:46.710]  will fall into the paper plate that depends on how big your plant is I've used a 22 inch
[04:46.710 --> 04:51.870]  kick drum head to collect pollen one time I did that and all of the fucking static electricity
[04:51.870 --> 04:55.870]  on the kick drum and I'm a drummer I got bass drum heads laying around I use the wrong damn
[04:55.870 --> 05:00.510]  drum head and all the static made the pollen move away from the drum head so as it fell
[05:00.510 --> 05:05.030]  it did some weird static reaction it all landed outside but get creative on things you can
[05:05.030 --> 05:09.030]  collect the pollen and start thinking about that before you're into flower you don't want
[05:09.030 --> 05:13.910]  to be moving that plant around jostling it a bunch once it does start dumping pollen
[05:13.910 --> 05:17.230]  because then you'll really knock a lot of pollen out of it it'll be easier to collect
[05:17.230 --> 05:22.070]  if you just already have your collection plan in place so where do we go from there switch
[05:22.070 --> 05:26.510]  it to 12 12 and wait that's absolutely what you do it will start dropping pollen you'll
[05:26.510 --> 05:32.110]  notice that like I said a moment ago around day 7 you'll start seeing sex around day 10
[05:32.110 --> 05:36.910]  it'll start making pollen sacs around day 12 they'll start swelling around day 14 through
[05:36.910 --> 05:41.950]  17 they'll start popping open possibly by day 21 they'll definitely be popping open
[05:41.950 --> 05:48.910]  and dropping pollen they will continue to drop pollen for several weeks up to week 9
[05:48.910 --> 05:52.710]  week 10 depending on your light cycle the vigor and health of your plant but they will
[05:52.710 --> 05:58.550]  keep on going that first pollen in my opinion is not the most viable the most active pollen
[05:58.550 --> 06:03.150]  you want that little bit later pollen pre pollen that's all I'm gonna say you can fill
[06:03.150 --> 06:07.710]  in the joke there you want the viable active pollen that comes out later alright so the
[06:07.710 --> 06:12.230]  next part of the question is when should I begin and end my pollen collection I've already
[06:12.230 --> 06:17.310]  said that you should have your pollen collection devices in place early so you've got your
[06:17.310 --> 06:21.910]  your your kick drum head your paper plate your glass your mirror whatever you're gonna
[06:21.910 --> 06:25.670]  collect that pollen on if that is already in place you're going to collect pollen as
[06:25.670 --> 06:30.190]  soon as it starts falling in my opinion some of the better pollen is the later falling
[06:30.190 --> 06:34.430]  pollen so just let it all fall and you'll gather a little bit of the pre pollen and
[06:34.430 --> 06:37.750]  you'll get a bunch of the good pollen all on your collection vessel there it will all
[06:37.750 --> 06:42.810]  be great if you're going to do a method where maybe you've got a container and you use something
[06:42.810 --> 06:47.990]  to tap the pollen into the container I would wait until you see it really dropping pollen
[06:47.990 --> 06:51.630]  it'll be sprinkling a little bit and then you'll see those male clusters they'll just
[06:51.630 --> 06:55.950]  go kapow you'll know you'll say well shit all the male flowers look like they're opening
[06:55.950 --> 07:01.070]  it is time to collect that pollen at that point get the main top of that plant have
[07:01.070 --> 07:05.430]  whatever you're collecting it into if it's a pie plate or a shoe box or whatever you're
[07:05.430 --> 07:09.570]  using and just tip that plant over and just give it a little jostle and pollen will go
[07:09.570 --> 07:14.070]  all over the place you're gonna get a lot of pollen turn off the fans don't have a lot
[07:14.070 --> 07:19.530]  of blowers going on be wearing clothing that you can change quickly or maybe minimal clothing
[07:19.530 --> 07:23.350]  maybe just a t-shirt maybe no t-shirt if you can head right to the shower if you got some
[07:23.350 --> 07:28.230]  dreadlocks have those things tied up the pollen so you're gonna collect the pollen
[07:28.230 --> 07:32.350]  tap that pollen into a container where do we go I've got two directions I want to go
[07:32.350 --> 07:36.670]  the pollen is going to be very viable and very potent be careful when you go into your
[07:36.670 --> 07:42.550]  grow room with your female plants water will deactivate this pollen so if you are going
[07:42.550 --> 07:46.910]  into your grow room spray yourself down with water change your clothes you should be safe
[07:46.910 --> 07:51.150]  but maybe spray those female plants in there before you as you enter spray them with the
[07:51.670 --> 07:57.150]  water that way the water will deactivate their pollen receivers and they won't get pollinated
[07:57.150 --> 08:01.230]  but water will mostly deactivate the pollen if it comes in contact with it you just have
[08:01.230 --> 08:06.510]  to make sure the water contacts the pollen talking about water you've got your pollen
[08:06.510 --> 08:11.830]  in a collection vessel we need to get all of the male flowers and chunky male parts
[08:11.830 --> 08:16.150]  out of that pollen I would start by spreading it out as thin as you can sometimes I use
[08:16.150 --> 08:21.350]  tweezers depending on how much pollen I'm storing I've also used different sifting techniques
[08:21.350 --> 08:26.510]  I've used pantyhose on top of a jar I've used a flower sifter before get the male parts
[08:26.510 --> 08:31.990]  out of the pollen is the main part here and keep the pollen as dry as you can keep it
[08:31.990 --> 08:37.430]  I said it a moment ago water and moisture destroy pollen so before you store your pollen
[08:37.430 --> 08:43.470]  airtight into any container make sure that it is completely 100% dry we want to dry this
[08:43.470 --> 08:47.630]  shit out of it I leave it sit now I cover it with a paper towel leave the container
[08:47.630 --> 08:51.750]  open it's just covered so that nothing else gets into it no wind will disrupt it but then
[08:51.750 --> 08:55.990]  all the air can escape all the moisture can escape once it is super crispy dry I scrape
[08:55.990 --> 09:00.910]  it up with the credit card I put it into a container with a silicate packet you do not
[09:00.910 --> 09:05.390]  want the thing you do not want the the botanic the what's it called I can't think of the
[09:05.390 --> 09:08.790]  humid a pack you don't want the the Boveda that's the word my brain wouldn't fucking
[09:08.790 --> 09:14.350]  think of you don't want a Boveda pack or a moisture pack you want a desiccant pack
[09:14.350 --> 09:19.510]  that will suck out all of the moisture you do not want any moisture in your seeds once
[09:19.510 --> 09:23.530]  you've got them sealed up or dried then you can seal them up store them in a cool dry
[09:23.530 --> 09:28.470]  dark place that is how I would store the pollen so let me make sure I'm answering the questions
[09:28.470 --> 09:33.030]  put it on 1212 yes it will begin to flower going to switch to a 1212 light cycle and
[09:33.030 --> 09:38.190]  wait when should I begin and end my pollen collection if you've got your pie plates or
[09:38.190 --> 09:43.470]  your drum heads in place it will begin collecting pollen early that pollen will be viable I
[09:43.470 --> 09:47.750]  just recommend that later pollen so collect pollen for a period of time and you'll have
[09:47.750 --> 09:52.430]  plenty of good pollen in the mix there when should I end my pollen collection once you've
[09:52.430 --> 09:57.710]  got enough if you're only going to make a small batch of seeds you only need a small
[09:57.710 --> 10:02.150]  like a half a dram if you know what a dram container is a half a dram will create plenty
[10:02.150 --> 10:06.430]  of seeds a full dram will make a lot of seeds any more than that you can really pollinate
[10:06.430 --> 10:11.830]  the shit out of a room so it just depends on how many seeds you want to make but let
[10:11.830 --> 10:16.510]  it go maybe let it go like four or five weeks into dropping pollen if you can and see the
[10:16.510 --> 10:20.870]  difference in the colors of that early pollen and the later pollen and watch it change feel
[10:20.870 --> 10:26.690]  the dustiness feel the grittiness it may change from like baby powder to a more sandy texture
[10:26.690 --> 10:32.150]  as the plants start dropping pollen later in the game but then again make sure you clean
[10:32.150 --> 10:36.190]  yourself up before you go in that girl room if you've got girl plants and flower because
[10:36.230 --> 10:41.630]  that's when you do risk pollinating plants you don't want pollinated all right so I feel
[10:41.630 --> 10:45.110]  like I've answered most of this when should I end my pollen collection you've probably
[10:45.110 --> 10:49.390]  got enough pollen after like a week or so of collecting pollen if you're going to manually
[10:49.390 --> 10:53.310]  collect it you could probably get it two or three times it will keep reproducing pollen
[10:53.310 --> 10:57.030]  so you could tap it out collect it give it four or five days tap it out collect it give
[10:57.030 --> 11:00.350]  four or five days do it again or just let it keep on growing there are a lot of great
[11:00.350 --> 11:05.550]  methods for collecting pollen it says surely the mail would be done for my purposes well
[11:05.910 --> 11:11.230]  before say week eight of a normal flowering cycle yes they will be done they could be
[11:11.230 --> 11:16.070]  done well before week eight I say 14 days to get in that's two weeks two weeks of pollen
[11:16.070 --> 11:20.030]  collection another week just to be fun we're only at like five weeks total into flower
[11:20.030 --> 11:23.650]  there so you could collect enough pollen in that amount of time I may go a little bit
[11:23.650 --> 11:27.230]  longer just to just to have enough pollen because I do larger pollinations than you're
[11:27.230 --> 11:32.030]  probably doing I feel like I have rambled my way through this question quite a bit I
[11:32.030 --> 11:35.950]  like giving a lot of attention to the patreon questions I just feel like they deserve the
[11:35.950 --> 11:41.030]  extra time and attention let's see yeah I think I covered you bro throw that fucker
[11:41.030 --> 11:46.790]  in 1212 and start collecting pollen and then have a strategy why did you select this mail
[11:46.790 --> 11:51.310]  is it just the boy you've got sometimes we do what we can do with what we've got I understand
[11:51.310 --> 11:55.670]  but did you select this mail for a purpose does he hold a trait that you desire to pass
[11:55.670 --> 11:59.710]  on to your progeny or does it just have a cool name that you want to mix in with another
[11:59.710 --> 12:03.270]  name or something I'm just curious why you've chosen this mail that is one of the most important
[12:03.270 --> 12:07.810]  parts of breeding then the second question why have you selected the females with which
[12:07.810 --> 12:12.430]  you have chosen to breed I could just be because we are working with what we've got but is
[12:12.430 --> 12:16.190]  there some selection happening do you think that this mail will provide something to this
[12:16.190 --> 12:20.910]  female structure is this female lacking something the male can fix is the female lacking or
[12:20.910 --> 12:24.790]  the you know what I'm trying to say bro is there a rhyme to your reason or are you just
[12:24.790 --> 12:28.910]  putting two people on a date so they can sport fuck or do you have a breeding plan in mind
[12:28.910 --> 12:33.270]  that is my main question as long as it's well thought out I think it will turn out
[12:33.270 --> 12:36.830]  very well then the next fun part bro once you pollinate all these plants you got to
[12:36.830 --> 12:41.950]  finish them out then the real fun is cleaning the seeds out of the weed that's always a
[12:41.950 --> 12:45.710]  good time if you make as many seeds as I do that'll take you a minute then you get to
[12:45.710 --> 12:50.070]  grow out a bunch of the seeds that you just made that is so much fun don't give out any
[12:50.070 --> 12:53.750]  of these seeds until you've tested them out you've got to grow them yourself if you do
[12:53.750 --> 12:57.310]  give them to your friends make sure they know that they are tester seeds that you haven't
[12:57.310 --> 13:01.230]  grown them enough to know if they're problematic hermaphroditic straight up mutants if they
[13:01.230 --> 13:06.830]  got terrible germination ratios if you got bad male to female ratios if they throw bananas
[13:06.830 --> 13:11.030]  in week seven or something discover all of that stuff before you go shipping them out
[13:11.030 --> 13:16.190]  to your friends all right to my anonymous friend who helps us out on patreon thank you
[13:16.190 --> 13:19.870]  for all the support I do appreciate seeing you pop up in the message if you've got any
[13:19.870 --> 13:25.750]  more questions please do feel free to shoot them my way on la patreon all right I've got
[13:25.750 --> 13:29.950]  a couple of more messages here in front of me let's jump right to let's do this one here
[13:29.950 --> 13:35.190]  this is gonna be a fun one this one says do they want their name said oh it's squirrel
[13:35.190 --> 13:39.390]  master and I learned where a squirrel master came from cool name super big shout out I
[13:39.390 --> 13:44.310]  like that let's keep going it says I love the show bro keep it up I promise you I will
[13:44.310 --> 13:50.510]  bro 614 episodes no reason to stop so I will keep rocking and rolling thank you for the
[13:50.510 --> 13:56.150]  encouragement says I do have another question for you I know in flower most people do say
[13:56.150 --> 14:01.710]  that day one is when they switch to 1212 so that is it says most people I'm going to say
[14:01.710 --> 14:08.190]  that is the general rule of thumb when it comes to growing cannabis we switch to 1212
[14:08.190 --> 14:13.310]  that is day one of the flowering cycle a lot of people say do I wait until I see pistols
[14:13.310 --> 14:19.510]  do I wait until that no you're in control that is your grow room you decide that that
[14:19.510 --> 14:25.310]  is the day one of flower the day you flip that plant that light cycle to 1212 so as
[14:25.310 --> 14:30.790]  a breeder I'm putting on my packages these seeds will take 9 to 11 weeks to flower that
[14:30.790 --> 14:35.430]  starts the day you flip the lights that is what I'm talking about so you should follow
[14:35.430 --> 14:39.150]  the guy who made the seed packages and the standard that way you should follow our advice
[14:39.150 --> 14:42.670]  in my opinion maybe I'm not the king or the authority or something but I would recommend
[14:42.670 --> 14:47.430]  you follow the breeders advice since we put the recommendation on the seeds we made yeah
[14:47.430 --> 14:51.670]  but then again a lot of breeders I could be guilty of this too because of phenotypes
[14:51.670 --> 14:54.990]  and grow rooms and shit but a lot of people will tell you this will finish in four weeks
[14:54.990 --> 14:59.150]  just so that you'll buy it you know what I mean but still try to take that breeders recommendation
[14:59.150 --> 15:03.990]  and it does start on the day you flip to 1212 not when you see pistols not when you see
[15:03.990 --> 15:08.590]  pre flowers not when the buds are setting not when the trichomes pop up it is the day
[15:08.590 --> 15:13.390]  you change the timer so I know in flower most people say day one is when we switch to 1212
[15:13.390 --> 15:18.310]  I'm going to say that that is when all people should say that day one of flowers but when
[15:18.310 --> 15:23.030]  does vegetative growth start from what I've read it seems like most people veg for about
[15:23.030 --> 15:28.190]  four weeks but what is officially day one of veg is it the day the sprouts pop up out
[15:28.190 --> 15:32.590]  of the ground I would say that's the seedling stage you have to go through seedling then
[15:32.590 --> 15:37.230]  you go through veg actually I do two different veg stages we'll touch on that in a moment
[15:37.230 --> 15:43.090]  or is it after two or three nodes grow or when also should day one of veg be the first
[15:43.090 --> 15:47.290]  feeding or should I wait or have already started feeding them thanks for your help
[15:47.290 --> 15:50.130]  that's going to play into part of what I was talking about a second ago with two different
[15:50.130 --> 15:56.490]  sizes of veg so the seedling phase until you've got like some true leaves some real growth
[15:56.490 --> 16:02.370]  going on then I would just say you're in a seedling stage once you've got a plant that
[16:02.370 --> 16:08.130]  you are confident in that you think is so it's just like taking home a little baby when
[16:08.130 --> 16:12.470]  you take home a brand new baby for that first week or so you were just checking it just
[16:12.470 --> 16:16.430]  randomly because it's not going to I don't mean to scare anybody out there that's got
[16:16.430 --> 16:19.950]  a new baby but when you're a new parent you're just checking on the baby is it breathing
[16:19.950 --> 16:24.270]  it did it die like you're just fucking freaked out so you're like that with a new baby plant
[16:24.270 --> 16:29.550]  also right once that like feeling of oh it's going to live I've actually got this plant
[16:29.550 --> 16:33.870]  I'm going to say that that's when you're officially out of the seedling stage and in a veg stage
[16:33.870 --> 16:38.570]  for most people most people may live in that fucking freaked out isn't going to survive
[16:38.570 --> 16:43.890]  stage the whole entire time excuse me but once it's got its first set of true leaves
[16:43.890 --> 16:47.610]  not those little shit leaves that grow little tiny ones not those little weak ones that
[16:47.610 --> 16:52.090]  pop out at first but that true set of serrated leaves with all of the fingers on it that's
[16:52.090 --> 16:58.130]  when I'm going to say you were officially in veg now that is my opinion I run a commercial
[16:58.130 --> 17:03.990]  grow I get to decide when day one of veg is and when seedling phase ends and when so another
[17:03.990 --> 17:09.070]  thing I want to talk about is I run two different veg phases so I start with I generally don't
[17:09.070 --> 17:13.210]  start with the ceiling in a commercial grow I'll start with the clone so let's just hypothetically
[17:13.210 --> 17:19.230]  say we go from seedling phase that's probably about two weeks or so depending on your environment
[17:19.230 --> 17:23.090]  the type of lights you're using how vigorous your seeds are it's going to be about two
[17:23.090 --> 17:28.830]  two and a half maybe three weeks of seedling stage then we are in what I would do is small
[17:28.830 --> 17:34.630]  veg that's what I'm using either a four inch nursery pot maybe a four or six inch net pot
[17:34.630 --> 17:39.430]  those are my small veg plants they get fed a little bit lighter of a mix I'm more focused
[17:39.430 --> 17:44.670]  on roots and just establishing a plant getting the root nice and healthy and getting it going
[17:44.670 --> 17:51.470]  I'm working on feeding it NPK microbes enzymes mostly things to get like lightning start
[17:51.470 --> 17:57.710]  and recharge things to get those roots really going shebang then I transplant into a depending
[17:57.710 --> 18:02.390]  on where I'm at what I'm doing sometimes a two sometimes a three sometimes a five gallon
[18:02.390 --> 18:07.270]  pot at this point I am in what I call large veg so I've gone from my clone phase which
[18:07.270 --> 18:11.230]  is a two week phase in the cloner that goes into my four inch net pot or my four inch
[18:11.230 --> 18:16.110]  nursery or my six inch net pot or I had my cloning phase which is just about two weeks
[18:16.110 --> 18:20.870]  the same amount of time as my cloning phase that I say clone my ceiling phase I'm not
[18:20.870 --> 18:23.770]  sure what I'm saying I'm trying to say all this on the fly I've got minimal notes you
[18:23.770 --> 18:27.310]  guys I hope you know this is all coming out of the top of my head I've got a two week
[18:27.310 --> 18:32.590]  either veg or ceiling phase then I go into a small veg phase in a four or six inch maybe
[18:32.590 --> 18:37.910]  an eight inch pot then I go into my one three or five gallon pot depending on the environment
[18:37.910 --> 18:41.550]  the grow that I'm working in the personal grow commercial grow greenhouse grow depends
[18:41.550 --> 18:47.670]  on where it's going that is when I consider myself in large veg that's when I'll kind
[18:47.670 --> 18:54.030]  of refocus my feeding regimen to go more toward developing shoots and branches more vegetative
[18:54.030 --> 18:58.790]  growth instead of focusing so much on the roots we're still feeding microbes were still
[18:58.790 --> 19:02.890]  feeding things to feed the roots encourage root growth but I'm more focused on getting
[19:02.890 --> 19:08.190]  nitrogen into the plant get it vigorous get it big get it happy I start getting it shaped
[19:08.190 --> 19:15.470]  for the flowering phase so I don't know that there is an official day when veg starts I
[19:15.470 --> 19:19.990]  say that it's when those real true leaves pop out and you've got a fucking plant that
[19:19.990 --> 19:23.410]  looks like a plant that you're not paranoid you don't have a little newborn that you're
[19:23.410 --> 19:27.530]  cuddling in a little blanket that's when I think we have actually got plants that are
[19:27.530 --> 19:32.610]  entering the vegetative phase so when they've got those first real fan leaves is when I
[19:32.610 --> 19:36.850]  say so the best part about running your own commercial grow is that sort of stuff is up
[19:36.850 --> 19:41.050]  to you or your own personal grow that stuff is up to you you get to make your own schedules
[19:41.050 --> 19:46.010]  your own cycles your own flows your own standard operating procedures these plants are very
[19:46.010 --> 19:52.270]  versatile very flexible they are adaptable they can grow your way you know there's no
[19:52.270 --> 19:56.030]  one way to grow it as long as we give it a veg cycle and a flowering cycle and we dry
[19:56.030 --> 19:59.670]  it and cure it properly most of the time we're going to come out with a usable product it's
[19:59.670 --> 20:03.930]  all about those details in the middle that dictate quality but there's no hard and fast
[20:03.930 --> 20:10.050]  rule set by day one of veg is this day unless you're in a commercial environment and you've
[20:10.050 --> 20:14.390]  written that SOP and then you get to decide that day one officially is this day I keep
[20:14.390 --> 20:18.470]  saying it I think it's when those true leaves first start popping out now you can start
[20:18.470 --> 20:23.430]  feeding it before that you can feed it very lightly before that they've got enough energy
[20:23.430 --> 20:26.830]  to get them going probably 14 days if you're going to go a little bit longer before you
[20:26.830 --> 20:31.410]  put it into a bigger pot or something definitely feed it give it a little bit of nitrogen focus
[20:31.410 --> 20:36.550]  on building solid roots something like lightning start maybe a little bit of recharge in there
[20:36.550 --> 20:40.470]  or the equivalent is always a good idea maybe some mammoth pea just to make it go shebang
[20:40.470 --> 20:47.870]  and get it started but I don't know that there is an official a book a rule a referee that
[20:47.870 --> 20:53.030]  tells us when official day one of veg is so you get to kind of decide that on your
[20:53.030 --> 20:57.470]  own you guys excuse me for the throat clearing I'm going to just take a drink here let's
[20:57.470 --> 21:10.970]  fix this right quick once again I'm sipping on that nuisance pineapple and what is that
[21:10.970 --> 21:15.930]  pineapple and coconut juice and it is divine oh I could just chug that whole cup and just
[21:15.930 --> 21:22.610]  one good fat drink there all right my friend squirrel master I hope I answered your question
[21:22.610 --> 21:27.450]  like I said there's no hard fast rule basically when you get your first true leaves that is
[21:27.450 --> 21:31.690]  when you have entered the vegetative stage then you get to decide how long you want to
[21:31.690 --> 21:39.290]  veg I do about 14 days in the clone or seedling stage two to three maybe four weeks in a small
[21:39.290 --> 21:45.450]  pot and then like five to maybe six weeks in a larger pot I got about a nine week vegetative
[21:45.450 --> 21:51.010]  stage a nine week flowering stage it works out real well but it's kind of up to you all
[21:51.010 --> 21:55.010]  right I feel like I got off on a long ramble on that one so let's jump into another email
[21:55.010 --> 21:59.330]  that will keep me a little bit more focused this one came from our friend do they want
[21:59.330 --> 22:03.370]  their name said it says trolling nobody knows who trolling is what I'm trolling and it's
[22:03.370 --> 22:09.050]  not trolling with an eye and it's trolling t-r-o-l-a-n a little bit different than trolling
[22:09.050 --> 22:14.130]  different type of vibe going on there no trolling but all trolling anyway the message goes hey
[22:14.130 --> 22:20.050]  RJ I love the podcast and the community you are creating thank you I appreciate that shout
[22:20.090 --> 22:25.050]  out to the IRI army and thank you for being a big part of that community it says easily
[22:25.050 --> 22:29.930]  one of the best and most inviting cannabis communities I've seen in the last six years
[22:29.930 --> 22:35.370]  of using cannabis for my service connected disabilities hey I owe you a big thank you
[22:35.370 --> 22:40.450]  for your service thank you we do appreciate that it goes on to say you've helped me grow
[22:40.450 --> 22:44.730]  much better than before and I cannot thank you enough you've earned my support and then
[22:44.730 --> 22:48.930]  some thank you that means a lot to me I'm glad to help you out in the garden hearing
[22:48.930 --> 22:53.410]  that I am making people's gardens better that's what I'm here for so that means a lot
[22:53.410 --> 22:57.850]  and just hearing that you guys recognize that we are kind of forming a community here that
[22:57.850 --> 23:01.890]  the IRI genetics that the grow from your heart podcast all the stuff I do is a big part of
[23:01.890 --> 23:06.930]  a community we've got a nice little crew the IRI army the other people that hang out you
[23:06.930 --> 23:11.050]  guys are awesome so thank you and thank you for noticing that I'm trying to kind of cultivate
[23:11.050 --> 23:15.730]  a little bit of a community here I understand that I accidentally became some kind of a
[23:15.730 --> 23:20.890]  community leader I do my best to embrace that role it goes on to say I especially liked
[23:20.890 --> 23:25.810]  your latest podcast talking about cannabis education I had a follow-up question I'm currently
[23:25.810 --> 23:31.290]  going to school to change careers into software engineering and programming oh man that's
[23:31.290 --> 23:35.090]  that stuff gives me a headache so I'm glad you are doing it it says I'll graduate in
[23:35.090 --> 23:40.010]  three years and I'm increasingly drawn to the agriculture technology side of cannabis
[23:40.010 --> 23:45.490]  like grow software and control what or where would you recommend to start getting involved
[23:45.530 --> 23:51.010]  in the nerdy side of cultivation I'm currently in Northern California but definitely curious
[23:51.010 --> 23:55.890]  of all of my options I love seeing the quality of your show increase with all the love you're
[23:55.890 --> 24:00.810]  getting and deserve take care from our friend trolling it's rolling first of all thanks
[24:00.810 --> 24:05.830]  again for the great compliments and I'm proud of you for going to school for software engineering
[24:05.830 --> 24:10.250]  and programming that sounds intimidating to me you'll graduate in three years that's awesome
[24:10.250 --> 24:14.630]  that you've got a plan my friend now you want to know where we can get you in in the cannabis
[24:14.750 --> 24:21.750]  industry the cannabis industry like all horticulture all cultivation industries are rapidly evolving
[24:23.750 --> 24:29.390]  I know you want to maybe do things like some sort of cultivation stuff like tracking or
[24:29.390 --> 24:33.390]  something like that I really like what Pete is doing shout out to my buddy Pete from PNL
[24:33.390 --> 24:37.470]  grow also shout out to PL grow systems check out their updated website big up to my friends
[24:37.470 --> 24:43.310]  at PL grow they he does a thing where he can take photos of plants with an infrared camera
[24:43.310 --> 24:47.910]  and identify plant issues before the human eye can even see it he is developing a database
[24:47.910 --> 24:52.310]  of photos that can help us identify plant issues by just taking a picture of our plant
[24:52.310 --> 24:57.990]  it'll say oh you've basically got this there are a lot of great technology options in the
[24:57.990 --> 25:03.270]  cannabis realm however what I think is really practical and that I think we are really lacking
[25:03.270 --> 25:09.750]  in a lot of existing and upcoming markets are opportunities for testing testing has
[25:09.750 --> 25:14.750]  become widely popular in the markets where it is available but it's not available to
[25:14.750 --> 25:20.790]  everybody yet in the cannabis industry whether it's commercial personal growing whatever
[25:20.790 --> 25:25.590]  if it's the caregiver model if it's the commercial grow there's not enough testing available
[25:25.590 --> 25:30.870]  people can get if you run a commercial cultivation you can get your product tested for terpenes
[25:30.870 --> 25:36.250]  for potency for mold for yeast for contaminants for heavy metals but in Colorado if you've
[25:36.250 --> 25:41.830]  got a personal grow you cannot get your product tested for anything so one of the first things
[25:41.830 --> 25:47.010]  I would like to see is more available of testing part of that reason is logistics and legalities
[25:47.010 --> 25:51.090]  they kind of cock blocked us on testing here because of legalities but in new markets you
[25:51.090 --> 25:55.970]  can work that into the new recreational and medical rules when you make that that you
[25:55.970 --> 26:00.610]  can have a testing facility available for the home grower that is something I think
[26:00.610 --> 26:09.930]  we need potency testing THC CBD CBN CBG THC V and whatever new cannabinoid is popular
[26:09.930 --> 26:14.010]  this week and by the time you listen to this podcast we should be testing for all of that
[26:14.010 --> 26:20.010]  stuff everybody should have access to that also I think we should have access to terpene
[26:20.010 --> 26:24.290]  testing we should be able to test our flowers and concentrates for terpenes we should also
[26:24.290 --> 26:28.410]  be able to test them like I said a moment ago for contaminants mold mildew pathogens
[26:28.410 --> 26:33.530]  problems also for pesticides and heavy metals I'd like to see that sort of stuff widely
[26:33.530 --> 26:37.450]  available maybe you could develop something for the home grower that they can do it at
[26:37.450 --> 26:41.590]  home maybe we can submit a sample anything at home and drop it off to you and it's already
[26:41.590 --> 26:44.610]  just ready all you gotta do is shake it or something you guys could do your job really
[26:44.610 --> 26:50.890]  quickly maybe you can offer something like that also a testing for presence of cannabinoid
[26:50.890 --> 26:54.570]  precursors all right I had to take a little drink there I apologize for that let me jump
[26:54.570 --> 27:00.170]  back right where I was another thing we could use is the testing labs that can show us the
[27:00.170 --> 27:05.090]  presence of precursors for cannabinoids it is very useful as a breeder to be able to
[27:05.090 --> 27:10.210]  take a sample of plant tissue send it to a lab and they can tell me that these samples
[27:10.210 --> 27:14.810]  of plants are high in cannabinoid precursors and this batch of plants isn't really testing
[27:14.810 --> 27:20.370]  high and cannabinoid precursors we can remove the low testers from the batch and we can
[27:20.370 --> 27:26.170]  actually do breeding based on the predicated testing from the presence of cannabinoid precursors
[27:26.170 --> 27:30.090]  and move forward with those high testing plants and not waste our time with the low testing
[27:30.090 --> 27:36.210]  plants if our goal is to breed for high THC so that's another lab I would love to see
[27:36.210 --> 27:41.570]  another thing I would love to see is something like gene verification I don't know if there's
[27:41.570 --> 27:46.330]  a market for this other than my desire but I would like to be able to I have created
[27:46.330 --> 27:51.470]  some strains so maybe I could send you a couple of samples of arise maybe a couple
[27:51.470 --> 27:55.730]  of samples of strawberry starburst maybe a morning dew sample and then you could take
[27:55.730 --> 28:01.530]  those samples and gene sequence them and put them in a database and have standard samples
[28:01.530 --> 28:06.410]  of real tested genetics that way we have a real database of real tested genetics there
[28:06.410 --> 28:10.530]  was another company doing it I've looked a lot at what they have posted it seems like
[28:10.530 --> 28:14.970]  a lot of their genetics their database is a little bit convoluted there was no way to
[28:14.970 --> 28:20.890]  stop anybody from sending a fake sample in there I don't know how reliable that database
[28:20.890 --> 28:26.210]  has become some of it is questionable to me but to do something that is a breeder based
[28:26.210 --> 28:32.130]  gene verification database would be really cool in my opinion like only the people that
[28:32.130 --> 28:36.930]  are breeding these strains or people who have been vetted or something people with a reputation
[28:36.930 --> 28:41.350]  people that you know and can rely on people that have been vetted that's what I'm trying
[28:41.350 --> 28:46.030]  to say people have been auditioned and gone through an application process can actually
[28:46.030 --> 28:49.750]  send you in tissue sample and get these plants into a database that is something I would
[28:49.750 --> 28:54.470]  love to see then in the future if somebody's got a clone in like five years and they're
[28:54.470 --> 28:57.830]  like bro I got the grateful dog you'd be like I don't know if you really do just send a
[28:57.830 --> 29:01.750]  sample of it to you and they'll go oh man you really do have the grateful dog or you're
[29:01.750 --> 29:05.470]  full of shit that is not the grateful dog that's actually just this you could actually
[29:05.470 --> 29:09.950]  tell them what it is if you've got a sample of that I know that sounds crazy that could
[29:09.950 --> 29:15.030]  be just a dream but there's something in there that could be viable for all growers
[29:15.030 --> 29:20.550]  some sort of gene verification would be really cool and we just got to be sure not to let
[29:20.550 --> 29:23.750]  that get corrupted because that's kind of what seems like happened last time they were
[29:23.750 --> 29:29.030]  allowing random samples in there the samples were just convoluted the database got convoluted
[29:29.030 --> 29:37.170]  then also the company seemed to use our data the data they collected for unscrupulous activity
[29:37.170 --> 29:41.310]  maybe the definition of it I'm trying to stay out all that right now and not get political
[29:41.310 --> 29:45.810]  on that bullshit but we could use a new company that does that with better interest is kind
[29:45.810 --> 29:51.890]  of what I'm thinking I want to say in agriculture technology there are so many people and so
[29:51.890 --> 29:57.570]  many things doing agricultural technology that I think the testing labs are what I desire
[29:57.570 --> 30:04.170]  the most tracking is done well seed to cell points are covered quite well pesticide application
[30:04.170 --> 30:11.530]  and stuff is done quite well I'm not sure honestly as a guy who's been growing before
[30:11.530 --> 30:17.250]  all this technology took over until it gets to giant scale cultivation I think we need
[30:17.250 --> 30:21.970]  to get back to our roots a little bit and stop paying so much attention to the meters
[30:21.970 --> 30:26.410]  and the technology don't get me wrong in a big cultivation I love all of the data that
[30:26.410 --> 30:31.490]  I can get that is great for the lead grower for upper management for the consultants but
[30:31.490 --> 30:36.410]  as grow techs and home growers I think most of those folks need to get away from all of
[30:36.410 --> 30:42.290]  the machines and devices and watch the plants I've been growing I don't need as many devices
[30:42.290 --> 30:47.210]  because I can look at the plants if you ever seen a guitar player get up on stage and if
[30:47.210 --> 30:51.330]  he doesn't need a guitar tuner doesn't he just look like that much more of a badass
[30:51.330 --> 30:54.970]  the guy that needs a guitar tuner you're like oh you can't tune by ear bro come on how long
[30:54.970 --> 30:59.250]  you been doing this I feel like I can tune the plants by ear I can just look at him and
[30:59.250 --> 31:05.650]  I can say oh this because I haven't been relying on all this amazing impressive technology
[31:05.650 --> 31:10.610]  I do use the technology to my advantage don't get me wrong I love the gear I love the toys
[31:10.610 --> 31:15.650]  they are great I use them second I find too many growers using the equipment the technology
[31:15.650 --> 31:19.730]  the toys the meters the gadgets first and they're always on their phone checking to
[31:19.730 --> 31:23.430]  see what's wrong with their grow when I go put your phone away bro let's go in the grow
[31:23.430 --> 31:28.490]  room and look at the plants and see what is wrong with those plants I use the plants first
[31:28.610 --> 31:33.690]  as my first guide my judgment my indicator they're going to tell me what's wrong before
[31:33.690 --> 31:38.050]  the meter like maybe one day your meter will beep and something will go bro it's too hot
[31:38.050 --> 31:41.690]  in here that's cool but most of the time I can look at the plants and they go it's too
[31:41.690 --> 31:46.690]  hot in here it's too cold in here also have you ever thought about just reaching out and
[31:46.690 --> 31:50.290]  touching the plants if you think it might be cold in the grow room it's a cold season
[31:50.290 --> 31:54.330]  right now if you think maybe the plants are cold touch them just reach out and put your
[31:54.330 --> 31:57.690]  hand on them just touch them just like your mama used to do and be like oh you need a
[31:57.690 --> 32:01.810]  sweater you could do that to the plants just touch the plants see if their cheeks are cold
[32:01.810 --> 32:04.890]  put your hands right around them they're yours you could touch them you could squeeze them
[32:04.890 --> 32:09.330]  violate them all you want anyway I do love all the technology I love seeing you guys
[32:09.330 --> 32:13.130]  advance all the technology and the toys and stuff in the grow environment but let's not
[32:13.130 --> 32:18.810]  forget that we've been growing these plants way way way before we had all this technology
[32:18.810 --> 32:23.210]  some of the most amazing cannabis I've seen grown came from just a very basic archaic
[32:23.210 --> 32:27.430]  almost basement grow with lights and fans and an air conditioner and the dude that grew
[32:27.430 --> 32:31.190]  it at the time had no idea that there was a way to set all this shit up with the internet
[32:31.190 --> 32:37.270]  and use all these monitors so I do appreciate your desire to be in the agricultural technology
[32:37.270 --> 32:43.390]  side of cannabis I don't think I gave you the details you want because you are in the
[32:43.390 --> 32:48.070]  software engineering and you want to do software and control and I recommended testing but
[32:48.070 --> 32:52.490]  honestly that is what I see is needed the most right now at this time a lot of the other
[32:52.490 --> 33:00.050]  stuff is well covered there are so many companies making VPD monitors and CO2 monitors and notification
[33:00.050 --> 33:06.370]  systems tracking systems weight systems data entry and data logging systems a lot of that
[33:06.370 --> 33:12.130]  stuff is taken up but we do need more labs in my opinion all right troll and I do want
[33:12.130 --> 33:15.490]  to thank you for the great question I wish I had a better answer for you I do want to
[33:15.490 --> 33:19.170]  thank you once again for your service I also want to wish you the best of luck in your
