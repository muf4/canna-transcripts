[01:12.460 --> 01:14.780]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:14.780 --> 01:19.020]  And you know I did include a link in the show notes and the video description to make it
[01:19.020 --> 01:23.340]  nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:23.340 --> 01:24.340]  Welcome to the show everybody.
[01:24.340 --> 01:27.380]  I did try to make it through that intro without having to clear my throat.
[01:27.380 --> 01:28.380]  But I'm nice and baked.
[01:29.100 --> 01:34.180]  I just took some fat dabs of some Arise Live batter that was made by a friend who would
[01:34.180 --> 01:35.540]  rather remain anonymous.
[01:35.540 --> 01:38.620]  We don't need to talk about who made that or how that got here.
[01:38.620 --> 01:43.580]  But if you are listening if you're watching this show bro the Arise Live batter that I
[01:43.580 --> 01:46.980]  got from you has me in some kind of way.
[01:46.980 --> 01:48.420]  The dabs hit so beautifully.
[01:48.420 --> 01:49.700]  It tasted amazing.
[01:49.700 --> 01:51.700]  It punched me right in the face.
[01:51.700 --> 01:53.140]  It definitely hit me in the chest.
[01:53.140 --> 01:54.140]  It's got my eyes heavy.
[01:54.140 --> 01:57.900]  I feel like my eyes are I got some sort of weights on my eyelids or something.
[01:58.420 --> 02:00.820]  I feel like my brain is in a little bit of a tunnel.
[02:00.820 --> 02:04.100]  It is a beautiful experience.
[02:04.100 --> 02:07.580]  It does have my throat and lungs a little bit fucked up but we'll get through this podcast
[02:07.580 --> 02:08.580]  together.
[02:08.580 --> 02:11.740]  Anyway if you wonder why I'm a little bit goofy here at the start of the show shout
[02:11.740 --> 02:15.140]  out to my friend who made the Arise Live batter.
[02:15.140 --> 02:16.700]  That stuff is delicious and beautiful.
[02:16.700 --> 02:20.100]  Unfortunately I've been smoked at all so it's time for more.
[02:20.100 --> 02:21.420]  Anyway big thank you.
[02:21.420 --> 02:22.460]  I did appreciate it.
[02:22.460 --> 02:25.020]  But next time bro send a bigger jar.
[02:25.060 --> 02:28.580]  You guys it is getting nice outside.
[02:28.580 --> 02:29.580]  I enjoyed today.
[02:29.580 --> 02:30.580]  It was a beautiful day.
[02:30.580 --> 02:32.460]  The sun has been shining.
[02:32.460 --> 02:37.340]  We are kind of evolving into the spring coming out of the cold winter season getting into
[02:37.340 --> 02:40.020]  the spring working our way toward the summer.
[02:40.020 --> 02:44.580]  What are you doing to prepare your grows for all these temperature swings all this chaos.
[02:44.580 --> 02:45.580]  Are you ready for this.
[02:45.580 --> 02:48.020]  Is your garden going to have powdery mildew.
[02:48.020 --> 02:49.740]  Also are you ready for outdoor season.
[02:49.740 --> 02:54.140]  We're already in April when I'm recording this it is now in April.
[02:54.260 --> 02:55.700]  Are you ready for the outdoor season.
[02:55.700 --> 02:57.460]  If you're not it is time to get ready.
[02:57.460 --> 03:00.540]  So let's get that grow room dialed in for the spring summer set up.
[03:00.540 --> 03:02.420]  Let's get ready for the outdoor season.
[03:02.420 --> 03:05.500]  It is time to get prepared for all of that stuff.
[03:05.500 --> 03:07.580]  420 is coming up ladies and gentlemen.
[03:07.580 --> 03:12.260]  What are we going to do for 420 this year while we are on a quarantine situation.
[03:12.260 --> 03:13.900]  Are we still going to be locked down.
[03:13.900 --> 03:15.580]  How are we going to do 420 again.
[03:15.580 --> 03:17.500]  Last year's 420 was a little bit weird.
[03:17.500 --> 03:20.180]  I miss going to all of the events going and seeing all my friends.
[03:20.180 --> 03:24.020]  It's been a long time since I've taken a dab in a big group of people.
[03:24.100 --> 03:25.460]  It has been a weird year.
[03:25.460 --> 03:27.300]  What are you going to do this year for 420.
[03:27.300 --> 03:28.300]  What do you have planned.
[03:28.300 --> 03:29.300]  Where are you going to go.
[03:29.300 --> 03:30.300]  What you going to do.
[03:30.300 --> 03:31.900]  Now that people are getting vaccinated.
[03:31.900 --> 03:33.620]  Now that the things are opening up.
[03:33.620 --> 03:34.620]  Rules are changing.
[03:34.620 --> 03:35.780]  People aren't so paranoid.
[03:35.780 --> 03:37.220]  Is it going to be a different year.
[03:37.220 --> 03:38.540]  Will 420 be different.
[03:38.540 --> 03:39.540]  I really don't know.
[03:39.540 --> 03:40.940]  I haven't made any plans yet.
[03:40.940 --> 03:41.940]  I don't know what's going on.
[03:41.940 --> 03:45.580]  I'm not ready to go out into big crowds yet.
[03:45.580 --> 03:49.860]  Even if the pandemic is chilled out the virus is kind of settled down a little bit.
[03:49.860 --> 03:51.780]  I don't know I'm not getting political on that.
[03:51.780 --> 03:53.580]  Even when that does kind of chill out.
[03:53.580 --> 03:55.800]  I'm still kind of worried about people.
[03:55.800 --> 03:57.220]  People are going to be acting kind of weird.
[03:57.220 --> 03:59.380]  They don't know how to behave themselves in public yet.
[03:59.380 --> 04:02.860]  I'm going to give people a little bit of time to go out and adjust and get their shit back
[04:02.860 --> 04:03.860]  together.
[04:03.860 --> 04:05.200]  Remember how to behave in a large group.
[04:05.200 --> 04:06.980]  Remember their manners.
[04:06.980 --> 04:10.700]  Let those weird incidents just get out of the way before I introduce myself back into
[04:10.700 --> 04:12.620]  the population.
[04:12.620 --> 04:13.660]  What are you doing for 420.
[04:13.660 --> 04:14.660]  I want to know.
[04:14.660 --> 04:19.300]  Send me a tweet at Rastajef420 or at GFYH podcast on the Twitter.
[04:19.300 --> 04:22.020]  You can message me on Instagram or of course send me an email.
[04:22.020 --> 04:23.860]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[04:23.860 --> 04:29.380]  I know one thing we're going to do some drops and 420 sales for 420.
[04:29.380 --> 04:30.380]  That's right.
[04:30.380 --> 04:32.820]  I've got a couple of strains I've been talking about quite a bit online.
[04:32.820 --> 04:36.740]  Those will drop at certain vendors that has not been planned arranged or set up completely
[04:36.740 --> 04:39.300]  yet still in the works when I have solid details.
[04:39.300 --> 04:41.000]  You will be the first to get info.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.180]  There will be fresh drops on 420.
[04:43.180 --> 04:44.920]  There will be some seed sales.
[04:44.920 --> 04:46.900]  There will be some merchandise sales.
[04:46.900 --> 04:47.900]  Stay tuned for that.
[04:47.900 --> 04:51.980]  One of the best ways to stay updated on that of course is to sign up for the newsletter
[04:51.980 --> 04:55.580]  on my website at ireegenetics.com.
[04:55.580 --> 04:57.780]  Halfway down there's a little newsletter spot.
[04:57.780 --> 04:59.400]  It says stay up to date.
[04:59.400 --> 05:00.740]  Type in your name or your email address.
[05:00.740 --> 05:01.740]  Don't put your name in there.
[05:01.740 --> 05:03.100]  Put your email address in there.
[05:03.100 --> 05:04.100]  Hit send.
[05:04.100 --> 05:05.880]  Then you will be on the email list.
[05:05.880 --> 05:10.140]  When I do set up the sale, update the coupon codes, all of that stuff, you will get an
[05:10.140 --> 05:11.140]  email.
[05:11.140 --> 05:15.600]  You will know what's on sale, what you need to shop for, what's about to drop.
[05:15.600 --> 05:18.280]  Also I'll let you know if I'm going to be on other podcasts, other shows, if I have
[05:18.280 --> 05:19.760]  other events coming.
[05:19.760 --> 05:20.760]  Sign up for the newsletter.
[05:20.760 --> 05:22.640]  I think it will be beneficial for you.
[05:22.640 --> 05:23.640]  All right.
[05:23.640 --> 05:27.600]  I feel like my lungs and my throat are almost catching up from those ridiculous dabs that
[05:27.600 --> 05:28.720]  I took.
[05:28.720 --> 05:30.280]  My head is still not caught up.
[05:30.280 --> 05:31.280]  I don't know if you could tell.
[05:31.280 --> 05:35.080]  My eyes are super droopy from the dabs and these lights are really killing me today,
[05:35.080 --> 05:36.080]  you guys.
[05:36.080 --> 05:37.080]  So thank you for hanging out.
[05:37.080 --> 05:38.080]  I hope you're having as much fun as I am.
[05:38.080 --> 05:42.760]  I did say that I was going to read some Patreon questions and some Grow questions.
[05:42.760 --> 05:46.040]  So let's cut the chatter and get right to the point of this podcast.
[05:46.040 --> 05:48.680]  I've got a bunch of great Grow questions in front of me.
[05:48.680 --> 05:52.320]  In the last episode, I did say that I got a bunch of short questions I wanted to catch
[05:52.320 --> 05:53.320]  up on.
[05:53.320 --> 05:54.840]  I've got a couple of those in this episode.
[05:54.840 --> 05:56.820]  So let's just jump right into it.
[05:56.820 --> 06:00.560]  This one says, I've got a breeder question.
[06:00.560 --> 06:05.600]  It says, I have a feminized seed for a strain that I really like and I want to cross her
[06:05.600 --> 06:07.080]  with a rise pollen.
[06:07.080 --> 06:08.080]  Okay.
[06:08.080 --> 06:11.840]  So you've got a feminized seed that you really like and you want to cross it with a rise.
[06:11.920 --> 06:12.920]  That's completely acceptable.
[06:12.920 --> 06:15.080]  Taking a rise male, put the pollen on it.
[06:15.080 --> 06:16.080]  That will work.
[06:16.080 --> 06:18.880]  A lot of people ask about breeding with feminized seeds.
[06:18.880 --> 06:19.880]  Do it.
[06:19.880 --> 06:20.880]  That's a good thing.
[06:20.880 --> 06:23.600]  There's nothing wrong with breeding with plants that came from a feminized seed.
[06:23.600 --> 06:28.800]  The next part of the question says, is there any reason or can it even be done for a breeder
[06:28.800 --> 06:34.080]  to achieve a male version of an original feminized seed?
[06:34.080 --> 06:36.320]  So that's a very good question.
[06:36.320 --> 06:37.320]  Where do we start here?
[06:37.320 --> 06:39.480]  There are a lot of things to talk about in this one.
[06:39.480 --> 06:44.880]  The question is, can a breeder basically make a male female seed?
[06:44.880 --> 06:49.840]  They want a male selection from a batch of seeds from a seed that is only a feminized
[06:49.840 --> 06:51.040]  seed line.
[06:51.040 --> 06:56.200]  Or we will go back and talk about that thing I mentioned before called clone only.
[06:56.200 --> 06:59.480]  So if you've got a clone only plant, and I'm going to touch on clone only really briefly
[06:59.480 --> 07:03.080]  because I've already done an episode about this, but when we say clone only, what we
[07:03.080 --> 07:09.320]  mean is that plant is not available in seed form, or at least it wasn't available in seed
[07:09.360 --> 07:14.280]  form until we had feminized seeds dialed in and somebody made it in fem seed, then it
[07:14.280 --> 07:15.600]  was available.
[07:15.600 --> 07:16.760]  So let's just pick a strain.
[07:16.760 --> 07:20.780]  One of my favorites to talk about, and this will put me on a good rant, is Gorilla Glue
[07:20.780 --> 07:22.200]  number four.
[07:22.200 --> 07:25.960]  There is not a male of Gorilla Glue number four.
[07:25.960 --> 07:30.640]  Gorilla Glue number four was a phenotype of a batch of Gorilla Glue seeds, and it was
[07:30.640 --> 07:33.500]  the number four phenotype in that batch.
[07:33.500 --> 07:34.920]  Number four was a female.
[07:34.920 --> 07:38.360]  It's the one that got popular, that got spread out, that everybody smokes, that everybody
[07:38.360 --> 07:39.360]  loves.
[07:39.360 --> 07:43.240]  So there is Gorilla Glue number four is a clone only.
[07:43.240 --> 07:46.220]  The breeder of that never put out any of the original seeds.
[07:46.220 --> 07:47.800]  He didn't let out other phenotypes.
[07:47.800 --> 07:49.420]  He did not let out a boy.
[07:49.420 --> 07:54.520]  So there's only a female phenotype of the Gorilla Glue number four, which is number
[07:54.520 --> 07:57.080]  four, and it is a clone only.
[07:57.080 --> 07:58.800]  So that's where we're going to start with clone only.
[07:58.800 --> 08:04.680]  All right, here's one way that I like to explain clone only that everybody will understand.
[08:04.680 --> 08:06.740]  Let's say that we discovered an animal.
[08:06.740 --> 08:07.740]  There's only one of them.
[08:08.120 --> 08:10.620]  We have found one of these animals, and it's a female.
[08:10.620 --> 08:14.500]  So we've got, and we're going to name this animal, just for the sake of this conversation,
[08:14.500 --> 08:18.020]  I'm going to name this animal Gorilla Glue number four.
[08:18.020 --> 08:19.300]  That's the name of this animal.
[08:19.300 --> 08:22.620]  It's walking around, it's growling, it's grunting, it's eating, it's pooping.
[08:22.620 --> 08:23.620]  It's an animal.
[08:23.620 --> 08:24.620]  It's a female.
[08:24.620 --> 08:26.580]  Its name is Gorilla Glue number four.
[08:26.580 --> 08:28.280]  How do we make more of them?
[08:28.280 --> 08:30.500]  We can't, because we don't have a male.
[08:30.500 --> 08:31.940]  This is a mammal.
[08:31.940 --> 08:34.860]  It's got to have some sort of, it's got to have sperm and an egg.
[08:34.860 --> 08:37.300]  It's got to have reproduction happening there.
[08:37.860 --> 08:40.700]  Without the other part of that reproduction, we cannot make more.
[08:40.700 --> 08:43.300]  Now that animal is basically clone only.
[08:43.300 --> 08:44.340]  There's only one of it.
[08:44.340 --> 08:45.780]  We can't reproduce it.
[08:45.780 --> 08:48.340]  Whoever created it didn't give us more seeds or more of that.
[08:48.340 --> 08:50.020]  We've only got the one.
[08:50.020 --> 08:52.060]  It's going to be the only one.
[08:52.060 --> 08:55.900]  Luckily, with plants, we can make clones, so it's clone only.
[08:55.900 --> 08:58.380]  But that one animal, that's the only one that there is.
[08:58.380 --> 08:59.540]  You can't reproduce that.
[08:59.540 --> 09:02.940]  The only way it can be reproduced is through clone.
[09:02.940 --> 09:06.420]  Clone only is the only way that that plant is available.
[09:06.420 --> 09:08.620]  That's what I'm talking about when I say clone only.
[09:08.620 --> 09:13.540]  That's why I like to pick Gorilla Glue number four, because it is a specific phenotype.
[09:13.540 --> 09:17.580]  If somebody tells you they've got seeds of Gorilla Glue number four, there's something
[09:17.580 --> 09:18.820]  done to those seeds.
[09:18.820 --> 09:21.180]  It's either feminized or it's been adulterated.
[09:21.180 --> 09:22.180]  It's a bat cross.
[09:22.180 --> 09:23.880]  It is something like that.
[09:23.880 --> 09:25.300]  That talks about clone only.
[09:25.300 --> 09:31.620]  The question is, can it be done if a breeder only has feminized seeds?
[09:31.620 --> 09:36.460]  If I had a clone only and I wanted to make seeds of it, let's talk about Golden Goat
[09:36.460 --> 09:39.220]  now because this has actually happened.
[09:39.220 --> 09:40.940]  People wanted Golden Goat seeds.
[09:40.940 --> 09:42.660]  Golden Goat is clone only.
[09:42.660 --> 09:46.260]  The original Golden Goat was not released in any seed form.
[09:46.260 --> 09:47.620]  No males were put out.
[09:47.620 --> 09:50.620]  There were a couple of phenotypes that were released of the Golden Goat.
[09:50.620 --> 09:51.660]  One was called the Golden Goat.
[09:51.660 --> 09:53.140]  The other one was called the Funky Bitch.
[09:53.140 --> 09:56.900]  There were others that were never sought after and very impressive.
[09:56.900 --> 09:59.220]  The Golden Goat was the one that was spread around.
[09:59.220 --> 10:01.980]  It's a clone only until I got my hands on it.
[10:01.980 --> 10:05.580]  Other people have done this too, but I'm saying until I got my grubby little paws on it and
[10:05.580 --> 10:07.420]  everybody was like, dude, I want Golden Goat seeds.
[10:07.420 --> 10:08.820]  I want Golden Goat seeds.
[10:08.820 --> 10:12.340]  I reversed it and made feminized Golden Goat seeds.
[10:12.340 --> 10:13.860]  Now the seeds were available.
[10:13.860 --> 10:19.260]  It is not clone only, but now what those are is Golden Goat S1 seeds.
[10:19.260 --> 10:21.300]  They are selfed S1s.
[10:21.300 --> 10:26.980]  My friend Pete's going to say they are F1s, but they are feminized S1 self seeds of the
[10:26.980 --> 10:27.980]  Golden Goat.
[10:28.100 --> 10:33.860]  They will be very, very close representations of the original Golden Goat female, but there
[10:33.860 --> 10:36.220]  will be some variation.
[10:36.220 --> 10:39.860]  You will find phenotypes that are complete mirrors of that original mom.
[10:39.860 --> 10:43.700]  You will also find phenotypes that are a little bit different in some ways.
[10:43.700 --> 10:44.700]  One will look more like mommy.
[10:44.700 --> 10:48.380]  One will look a little bit more like daddy, but you're going to find a lot that look just
[10:48.380 --> 10:50.020]  like the original mom.
[10:50.020 --> 10:55.460]  Now it's important that we label that Golden Goat S1 because it's not the original Golden
[10:55.460 --> 10:56.460]  Goat.
[10:56.460 --> 10:57.460]  It is not the clone only.
[10:57.940 --> 11:01.860]  I'm not pleading to say that that is Golden Goat if you're giving the clones out to somebody
[11:01.860 --> 11:02.860]  else to grow.
[11:02.860 --> 11:05.380]  If you're just growing it in your garden, you're growing it, you're smoking it, you're
[11:05.380 --> 11:06.620]  enjoying it.
[11:06.620 --> 11:10.540]  Label it whatever you want, but if you're going to pass that clone on, make sure people
[11:10.540 --> 11:16.540]  know that that was a Golden Goat clone from your feminized seed stock, not from my original
[11:16.540 --> 11:22.300]  Golden Goat stock or Mr. Dank's original Golden Goat stock.
[11:22.300 --> 11:24.940]  All right, so we've gotten to clone only.
[11:24.940 --> 11:26.340]  Now we've gotten to feminized seeds.
[11:26.340 --> 11:30.860]  Now the question is, is there a way for a breeder to achieve a male version of the original
[11:30.860 --> 11:33.180]  feminized seed?
[11:33.180 --> 11:36.720]  This is where we work into a back cross.
[11:36.720 --> 11:42.860]  A back cross is the closest representation that we can pull out from a feminized seed
[11:42.860 --> 11:47.900]  to achieve a male that will look like the plant we're looking for for our breeding project.
[11:47.900 --> 11:50.340]  A back cross is often labeled BX.
[11:50.340 --> 11:56.540]  A back cross is also commonly labeled BC, which I'm learning may be the correct term.
[11:56.540 --> 11:59.980]  We're adulterating and fucking up terms here in the cannabis industry, and I'm going to
[11:59.980 --> 12:02.220]  do another conversation about that very soon.
[12:02.220 --> 12:04.940]  But you will see BX or BC.
[12:04.940 --> 12:06.340]  That means back cross.
[12:06.340 --> 12:09.500]  There will also be a number after those letters.
[12:09.500 --> 12:13.260]  If it's just BX or BC, it is a back cross number one.
[12:13.260 --> 12:19.100]  If you see the BX or BC and then a number, it's a BX2, back cross two, back cross three,
[12:19.100 --> 12:24.140]  back cross four, which is a different generation and working of the back cross in an effort
[12:24.140 --> 12:28.340]  to stabilize the traits which we are looking for, isolate the plant we're looking for,
[12:28.340 --> 12:32.740]  and remove the other plant traits which we adulterated this plant with to create the
[12:32.740 --> 12:33.740]  seeds.
[12:33.740 --> 12:36.060]  Now let's talk about this adulteration I'm talking about.
[12:36.060 --> 12:41.780]  We want to make seeds, regular seeds from a plant which we have only got feminized seed
[12:41.780 --> 12:42.780]  stock.
[12:42.780 --> 12:44.940]  So we're starting with feminized seeds.
[12:44.940 --> 12:46.060]  Grow those seeds.
[12:46.060 --> 12:47.340]  Find the one that you like.
[12:47.340 --> 12:50.420]  Find your phenotype that suits your project the best.
[12:50.420 --> 12:53.740]  I'm going to say we're working with golden goat because I have done this and it is easy
[12:53.740 --> 12:55.600]  to follow this example.
[12:55.600 --> 12:58.140]  So I have the original golden goat.
[12:58.140 --> 13:02.860]  I want to make regular seeds of golden goat, but it's clone only because I've only got
[13:02.860 --> 13:03.860]  that female.
[13:03.860 --> 13:05.300]  There isn't a boy to play with.
[13:05.300 --> 13:11.740]  I've got to find something to pollinate my golden goat with to make more seeds.
[13:11.740 --> 13:14.640]  So here is how I approached a back cross.
[13:14.640 --> 13:16.720]  There are several ways to do this.
[13:17.100 --> 13:19.300]  This is how I did it and why I did it.
[13:19.300 --> 13:23.360]  And I'm just going to talk about it and I am open to your criticism and I'm excited
[13:23.360 --> 13:24.360]  to see the feedback.
[13:24.360 --> 13:25.720]  Here is what I did.
[13:25.720 --> 13:26.720]  My goal.
[13:26.720 --> 13:32.280]  My goal was to create golden goat back cross seeds that closely represented the original
[13:32.280 --> 13:37.800]  golden goat when grown without being feminized because many people are not fans of feminized
[13:37.800 --> 13:38.800]  seeds.
[13:38.800 --> 13:42.680]  The way I did this, I took the original golden goat female.
[13:42.680 --> 13:48.620]  I took a male plant that was completely different from that golden goat in every way.
[13:48.620 --> 13:51.120]  It was different.
[13:51.120 --> 13:52.280]  Excuse the throat clearing you guys.
[13:52.280 --> 13:53.340]  I apologize for that.
[13:53.340 --> 13:55.740]  Not going to edit it out because I'm on a fat flow.
[13:55.740 --> 13:57.120]  Did take some fat dabs.
[13:57.120 --> 13:58.880]  I took the original golden goat.
[13:58.880 --> 14:03.800]  I pollinated that with a male plant that was completely different from golden goat in every
[14:03.800 --> 14:04.800]  way.
[14:04.800 --> 14:11.780]  It was different in aroma, flavor, buzz, but most importantly, structure and leaf shape.
[14:11.880 --> 14:17.300]  In growing these two plants, I could vastly see that this plant had long, skinny, pointy,
[14:17.300 --> 14:21.960]  sharp, serrated edge leaves and it grew tall and are not super tall, but it stayed kind
[14:21.960 --> 14:26.060]  of squatty, but it got tall and sativa like, and I could really see that plant structure
[14:26.060 --> 14:27.060]  in the golden goat.
[14:27.060 --> 14:30.860]  Golden goat has a very unique growth and it, once you grow it, you'll see it and you'll
[14:30.860 --> 14:33.500]  go, yeah, that's noticeable from across the room.
[14:33.500 --> 14:37.820]  The other plant that I was working with was an OG Kush dominant plant.
[14:37.820 --> 14:41.620]  I used a day breaker male, which is Joseph OG and Kim D.
[14:41.660 --> 14:42.660]  I may have done that backwards.
[14:42.660 --> 14:46.540]  It is a Kim D female to a Joseph OG male.
[14:46.540 --> 14:50.660]  So I took that day breaker male and I used the pollen from that day breaker.
[14:50.660 --> 14:52.900]  The day breaker had gigantic leaves.
[14:52.900 --> 14:56.420]  So the golden goat had long, skinny leaves that were real sharp.
[14:56.420 --> 15:00.380]  The day breaker had leaves that you could pull the leaves off and build a canopy and
[15:00.380 --> 15:02.260]  fucking camp out underneath those things.
[15:02.260 --> 15:04.680]  The leaves were so big, they worked like umbrellas.
[15:04.680 --> 15:06.500]  You could shade the whole house, the whole car.
[15:06.500 --> 15:07.980]  You could build a village with those leaves.
[15:07.980 --> 15:09.780]  They were so big.
[15:09.780 --> 15:14.040]  The golden goat was real sturdy and grew really quickly.
[15:14.040 --> 15:17.300]  That day breaker was a little spindly, kind of OG Kushy.
[15:17.300 --> 15:21.600]  If you know anything about growing an OG Kush plant, it had that serious OG Kush going
[15:21.600 --> 15:22.680]  on to it.
[15:22.680 --> 15:28.360]  So I then pollinated the golden goat female with the pollen from the original day breaker
[15:28.360 --> 15:29.360]  male.
[15:29.360 --> 15:30.760]  Now we've got seeds.
[15:30.760 --> 15:34.620]  This batch of seeds is where King Solomon came from, but that's another story.
[15:34.620 --> 15:36.320]  We'll talk about that later.
[15:36.320 --> 15:42.640]  In this batch of seeds, I selected a male that looks exactly like the golden goat.
[15:42.640 --> 15:45.680]  And we'll talk about how I did that.
[15:45.680 --> 15:51.680]  I found a plant that had long, skinny leaves that when I rubbed the stem, it smelled just
[15:51.680 --> 15:54.120]  like the female golden goat when I rubbed the stem.
[15:54.120 --> 15:57.340]  So that's telling me I've got a really, really good match.
[15:57.340 --> 15:59.000]  So I'm looking for leaf shape.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.560]  And I went as far as to take the leaves off of this plant and hold them over the leaves
[16:03.560 --> 16:04.560]  on this plant.
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.560]  So I've got the leaves and I'm matching them up like puzzle pieces to find the plant, the
[16:08.560 --> 16:12.720]  male plant that made the leaves that look just like that original golden goat.
[16:12.720 --> 16:19.000]  Now my goal, my idea was to find a male plant that carried all of those golden goat traits,
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.260]  but did not look like the day breaker.
[16:21.260 --> 16:26.040]  That's why I chose a plant that was so vastly different from the golden goat.
[16:26.040 --> 16:30.280]  I basically was mixing red and blue marbles in a jar.
[16:30.280 --> 16:35.120]  And I'm just trying to find the blue marbles again later when I went looking for my phenotype.
[16:35.120 --> 16:40.120]  They were so far apart in visual appearance that it was really obvious which phenotypes
[16:40.120 --> 16:41.120]  were golden goat.
[16:41.120 --> 16:44.020]  It was really obvious which phenotypes were day breaker.
[16:44.020 --> 16:45.320]  So I searched through those.
[16:45.320 --> 16:47.360]  I grew out a lot of male plants.
[16:47.360 --> 16:51.920]  My main goal for this project was to find King Solomon is who I was looking for.
[16:51.920 --> 16:57.840]  But along the way, I found a golden goat keeper that was fucking perfect in my opinion.
[16:57.840 --> 17:00.780]  It grew just like the golden goat female.
[17:00.780 --> 17:05.460]  If I put them side by side, this male and this female in veg and let them grow for the
[17:05.460 --> 17:08.480]  first like four or five weeks, they would mimic each other.
[17:08.480 --> 17:11.580]  They would start to change a little bit closer to flower because the male and the female
[17:11.580 --> 17:13.880]  start doing a little bit different things in flower.
[17:13.880 --> 17:15.480]  But they looked like that.
[17:15.480 --> 17:16.760]  They looked like fucking clones.
[17:16.760 --> 17:18.160]  They looked like twins of each other.
[17:18.160 --> 17:19.560]  I was super excited.
[17:19.560 --> 17:24.000]  So now I've got a male that looks just like my original golden goat, right?
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.920]  I've got a male that is golden goat to day breaker.
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.760]  That's 50% golden goat, 50% day breaker.
[17:29.760 --> 17:34.560]  But it looks so much like the golden goat that I want to say it was like 70 to 80% golden
[17:34.560 --> 17:35.560]  goat.
[17:35.560 --> 17:37.120]  I hope I said that right.
[17:37.120 --> 17:39.040]  It was really close to golden goat.
[17:39.040 --> 17:40.280]  So close to golden goat.
[17:40.280 --> 17:42.240]  So I took that golden goat male.
[17:42.240 --> 17:43.240]  All right.
[17:43.240 --> 17:47.680]  I got a boy and I put that pollen on the original golden goat girl.
[17:47.680 --> 17:52.800]  Now we have got the for the pollen donor is like 70 to 80%.
[17:52.800 --> 17:54.560]  We'll just say 75%.
[17:54.560 --> 18:01.320]  That is three quarters golden goat in my opinion by looks, by smell, by growth characteristics.
[18:01.320 --> 18:05.160]  And then we put that on a plant that is 100% golden goat.
[18:05.160 --> 18:08.520]  We've got like if you do the math on there, I'm not going to get the math perfectly.
[18:08.520 --> 18:14.120]  It's probably in the high 80s, low 90s percentage of phenotypes that should look just like the
[18:14.120 --> 18:18.720]  original golden goat because the amount of genetic that you put in there is so much like
[18:18.720 --> 18:19.720]  the golden goat.
[18:19.720 --> 18:20.720]  I'm going to say it's probably 85%.
[18:21.320 --> 18:27.960]  At least 75% of the phenotypes that come out of those seeds are very, very close representations
[18:27.960 --> 18:29.520]  of the original golden goat.
[18:29.520 --> 18:31.320]  So I've told you my idea.
[18:31.320 --> 18:32.660]  I told you my goal.
[18:32.660 --> 18:37.120]  I told you my method and I told you what I did and I told you how it came out.
[18:37.120 --> 18:43.720]  The BX one or the BC one, the back cross one looks very, very close to that original golden
[18:43.720 --> 18:44.720]  goat.
[18:44.720 --> 18:47.240]  So now what I could, should, maybe we'll do in the future.
[18:47.240 --> 18:48.600]  I've got so many projects in mind.
[18:48.600 --> 18:51.040]  You guys that it's hard to keep up with my own ideas.
[18:51.040 --> 18:56.980]  What I want to do in the future, I want to grow a batch of those golden goat back cross
[18:56.980 --> 19:03.000]  one seeds and now find another male in there that is even closer to the original golden
[19:03.000 --> 19:04.000]  goat.
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.120]  I don't know if I can get closer, but technically there are more golden goat marbles in this
[19:09.120 --> 19:13.240]  mix than there are daybreaker marbles in this mix by a long shot.
[19:13.240 --> 19:18.840]  So maybe I can even narrow it down to get like 92% of the phenotypes to look just like
[19:18.840 --> 19:20.240]  the original mom.
[19:20.240 --> 19:24.560]  Then I would repeat that process, find a male out of those seeds and I'm going to keep pollinating
[19:24.560 --> 19:27.000]  that original golden goat female.
[19:27.000 --> 19:32.360]  So every time I do this, if I do it correctly, I'm getting closer and closer to recreating
[19:32.360 --> 19:33.640]  that original golden goat.
[19:33.640 --> 19:38.680]  By the time we get to the second, third, maybe fourth back cross, they should come out very,
[19:38.680 --> 19:41.400]  very uniform compared to that original golden goat.
[19:41.400 --> 19:43.080]  You guys, I need a little drink of this coconut water.
[19:43.080 --> 19:44.080]  My throat is itchy.
[19:44.080 --> 19:46.760]  It's kind of dry from the dabs, but I'm not ready to stop yet.
[19:46.760 --> 19:48.120]  So I'm going to freshen up the voice.
[19:48.120 --> 19:51.360]  We're going to keep talking here.
[19:51.360 --> 19:53.440]  Can it be done or is there a reason?
[19:53.440 --> 19:54.640]  Yes, it can be done.
[19:54.640 --> 19:57.240]  It can be done by keep back crossing.
[19:57.240 --> 19:59.600]  The genetics will be what I call adulterated.
[19:59.600 --> 20:03.920]  It's not going to be pure golden goat and it is important as a seed seller.
[20:03.920 --> 20:08.560]  If you're giving away clones, if you're selling, trading, sharing seeds, make it known that
[20:08.560 --> 20:12.720]  this is the golden goat back cross and not the original golden goat.
[20:12.720 --> 20:19.200]  That is very important in my opinion, as a breeder, as a seed maker, as a podcaster,
[20:19.200 --> 20:23.880]  as the person in my position in the cannabis community, world, industry, whatever you want
[20:23.880 --> 20:25.040]  to call it.
[20:25.040 --> 20:26.120]  We've got responsibilities.
[20:26.120 --> 20:27.520]  I've got a huge responsibility.
[20:27.520 --> 20:31.840]  I've kind of dedicated myself to being sort of a cannabis historian.
[20:31.840 --> 20:33.280]  This is documented history.
[20:33.280 --> 20:34.840]  This is happening here.
[20:34.840 --> 20:40.000]  I think it's partly my responsibility, but also if you're giving out seeds, sharing seeds,
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.040]  it's your responsibility to keep this cannabis history very genuine and very true and very
[20:45.040 --> 20:46.040]  pure.
[20:46.040 --> 20:47.040]  I'm going to take a drink because I really need it.
[20:47.040 --> 20:59.660]  I'm going to take another drink because that one was so good.
[20:59.660 --> 21:01.820]  Shout out to the coconut water.
[21:01.820 --> 21:04.860]  They don't pay me, but I like it.
[21:04.860 --> 21:05.860]  They should pay me.
[21:05.860 --> 21:08.580]  Hey, Vitacoco, if you want to send me some coconut water, I would take it.
[21:08.580 --> 21:13.220]  Also David GTs, I drink two of those blue kombuchas every day, bro.
[21:13.220 --> 21:14.220]  Talk to me.
[21:14.220 --> 21:15.220]  All right.
[21:15.220 --> 21:16.220]  You guys, shameless advertising here.
[21:16.220 --> 21:17.220]  Nobody's paying me for this.
[21:17.220 --> 21:18.340]  I'm just having fun today.
[21:18.340 --> 21:20.620]  Really loving podcasting.
[21:20.620 --> 21:25.740]  Anyway, the reason for doing this would be to achieve a non-feminized version of the
[21:25.740 --> 21:26.740]  golden goat seeds.
[21:26.740 --> 21:30.700]  A lot of people have a deep founded hatred for feminized seeds.
[21:30.700 --> 21:33.820]  A lot of that, in my opinion, is miseducation.
[21:33.820 --> 21:40.260]  A lot of that, in my opinion, is people were making poor feminized seeds years ago.
[21:40.260 --> 21:44.100]  Years ago, they tried to make feminized seeds that just weren't working.
[21:44.100 --> 21:46.020]  That did give fems a bad reputation.
[21:46.020 --> 21:49.220]  Now I feel like I understand how to make feminized seeds.
[21:49.220 --> 21:52.220]  I understand the selecting of the plants.
[21:52.220 --> 21:54.460]  I understand the process of creating feminized pollen.
[21:54.460 --> 21:57.420]  I understand the project of putting the two together.
[21:57.420 --> 21:58.660]  I know how to do that.
[21:58.660 --> 22:01.940]  Now I think feminized seeds are much more reliable.
[22:01.940 --> 22:03.140]  They're better made.
[22:03.140 --> 22:04.540]  The breeders are more responsible.
[22:04.540 --> 22:07.300]  They're more ethically sourced and better done.
[22:07.300 --> 22:09.580]  A lot of people have a lot of hatred for fem seeds.
[22:09.580 --> 22:12.300]  That is why we are making bat cross seeds.
[22:12.300 --> 22:16.020]  We've got to adulterate that original cross.
[22:16.020 --> 22:20.820]  The toss up there is do you want feminized seeds or slightly adulterated crosses to achieve
[22:20.820 --> 22:22.580]  the project you're looking for?
[22:22.580 --> 22:23.580]  Is there any reason?
[22:23.580 --> 22:25.300]  Yes, because people don't want fem seeds.
[22:25.300 --> 22:26.300]  Can it be done?
[22:26.300 --> 22:29.700]  Yes, through bat crossing, but then it is adulterated.
[22:29.700 --> 22:31.060]  I think I answered that question.
[22:31.060 --> 22:33.180]  I really went on about that one.
[22:33.180 --> 22:35.240]  That got me on a good rant, which I've needed.
[22:35.240 --> 22:37.860]  I think the audience enjoys when I get going like that.
[22:37.860 --> 22:38.940]  Thank you for that one.
[22:38.940 --> 22:42.180]  You did not say if you wanted your name said on the show or not, so I'm not going to say
[22:42.180 --> 22:44.580]  it because it's easier that way for both of us.
[22:44.580 --> 22:45.900]  Either way, big shout out.
[22:45.900 --> 22:47.420]  Thank you for the great content.
[22:47.420 --> 22:48.420]  Big fist bump.
[22:48.420 --> 22:49.420]  You know who you are.
[22:49.420 --> 22:53.420]  Let's move into the next one because I'm awful freaking rambly.
[22:53.420 --> 22:55.180]  Is it mathematically possible?
[22:55.180 --> 22:57.940]  That's one of the updates that they sent for this question.
[22:58.940 --> 23:03.860]  Yes, it is mathematically possible to create that male, but you're going to have to do
[23:03.860 --> 23:04.860]  some bat crossing.
[23:04.860 --> 23:07.540]  They wrap that message up with, I am high.
[23:07.540 --> 23:12.380]  Then they kind of ask in a roundabout way if it's possible to get a male from a feminized
[23:12.380 --> 23:13.380]  seed.
[23:13.380 --> 23:17.180]  Yes, sometimes a male will pop up in a feminized seed.
[23:17.180 --> 23:18.300]  It is very uncommon.
[23:18.300 --> 23:22.340]  It's probably one in a million to get a male from a feminized seed.
[23:22.340 --> 23:28.660]  I've seen a line that I've worked with for a little while now that it's a feminized project
[23:28.660 --> 23:32.980]  and about one in every 5,000 seeds or so.
[23:32.980 --> 23:33.980]  It's hard to guess.
[23:33.980 --> 23:34.980]  I know how many seeds were produced.
[23:34.980 --> 23:36.660]  I know how many were put out.
[23:36.660 --> 23:39.860]  I don't know how many were grown, so all the reports can't be completely accurate because
[23:39.860 --> 23:40.940]  I don't know.
[23:40.940 --> 23:43.840]  People buy seeds and put them in a drawer and stash them and hoard them and keep them
[23:43.840 --> 23:46.060]  like Pokemon cards and don't grow them.
[23:46.060 --> 23:50.060]  I've seen two males pop up from one strain that is feminized.
[23:50.060 --> 23:51.060]  Solid males.
[23:51.060 --> 23:53.260]  I don't know what happened, but two people have sent me a picture of a male and they're
[23:53.260 --> 23:54.260]  like, hey, these are fems.
[23:54.260 --> 23:55.740]  How do I have a male?
[23:55.740 --> 23:56.900]  That is genetics.
[23:56.900 --> 24:03.100]  As a breeder, as a seed maker, I understand that I'm toying with science and nature and
[24:03.100 --> 24:04.420]  I make great selections.
[24:04.420 --> 24:05.420]  I do my research.
[24:05.420 --> 24:08.620]  I do my due diligence, but it is nature.
[24:08.620 --> 24:12.300]  You can train your dog to do all the tricks and all the fucking magic you want that dog
[24:12.300 --> 24:16.480]  to do, but one day that dog may shit right on the rug and occasionally that stuff happens
[24:16.480 --> 24:17.480]  in life.
[24:17.480 --> 24:19.980]  We're working with seeds and nature and there are anomalies here.
[24:20.820 --> 24:27.420]  But that male plant popping up in fem seeds is probably about one in a million to be quite
[24:27.420 --> 24:28.420]  honest with you.
[24:28.420 --> 24:29.420]  That's going to happen.
[24:29.420 --> 24:30.420]  That's just genetics.
[24:30.420 --> 24:31.880]  That's the way that the cookie crumbles.
[24:31.880 --> 24:34.420]  That's the way the genetic dice roll goes.
[24:34.420 --> 24:40.420]  Like I said, you can have things perfect 9,999 times or 999 times, however many, but it's
[24:40.420 --> 24:42.980]  always that opportunity for one time for things to go weird.
[24:42.980 --> 24:46.980]  No matter how good your genetics are, no matter how good your breeding project is, something
[24:46.980 --> 24:47.980]  can go wrong.
[24:47.980 --> 24:51.460]  Maybe somebody's got a grow room with one magic fucking thing happening in there that
[24:51.460 --> 24:52.740]  you never thought of.
[24:52.740 --> 24:56.080]  And that weird environmental trigger will just bring out something you've never seen
[24:56.080 --> 24:57.080]  as a breeder.
[24:57.080 --> 24:59.660]  Anyway, um, yes, you can get a male.
[24:59.660 --> 25:01.340]  It is very uncommon.
[25:01.340 --> 25:04.660]  One in a million to get that male out of a feminize seed.
[25:04.660 --> 25:07.340]  I'm not sure if I would breed with that, throw that away.
[25:07.340 --> 25:12.300]  Uh, as a breeder, I would have to just use that pollen, just put it on a couple of plants
[25:12.300 --> 25:13.740]  and then see what came out of it.
[25:13.740 --> 25:17.680]  Just because I'm a curious breeder, the, uh, I'm passionately curious.
[25:17.680 --> 25:20.800]  The curiosity in me is what keeps all of this going.
[25:20.800 --> 25:21.800]  All right.
[25:21.800 --> 25:23.800]  I want to read more questions cause I'm getting rambly.
[25:23.800 --> 25:28.240]  Uh, this one says if seeds here now will not let me combine my discounts on I read genetics
[25:28.240 --> 25:29.520]  purchases.
[25:29.520 --> 25:33.860]  What breeders on seeds here now would you recommend I spend my saved points on?
[25:33.860 --> 25:35.040]  That is a really good question.
[25:35.040 --> 25:36.040]  You guys.
[25:36.040 --> 25:41.280]  Um, so our friend here is shopping on seeds here now.com use coupon code GFYH10.
[25:41.280 --> 25:43.480]  That'll save you 10% on your order.
[25:43.480 --> 25:46.440]  But when you're shopping at seeds here now.com you do acquire points.
[25:46.440 --> 25:49.200]  You accrue points is the word I think I'm trying to use.
[25:49.200 --> 25:51.560]  Every purchase you make earns you points.
[25:51.560 --> 25:52.960]  Those points go to your account.
[25:52.960 --> 25:58.160]  In the future you can use those points to make purchases, points toward purchases, but
[25:58.160 --> 26:00.320]  they're not letting you combine discounts.
[26:00.320 --> 26:03.440]  If you use that coupon code GFYH10, you save 10%.
[26:03.440 --> 26:06.160]  You cannot also double dip and use your points.
[26:06.160 --> 26:10.360]  So my friend is asking, are there any other breeders that you would recommend I can spend
[26:10.360 --> 26:12.080]  my points on?
[26:12.080 --> 26:14.040]  That is a very, uh, good question.
[26:14.040 --> 26:15.480]  It's a kind of puts me on the spot.
[26:15.520 --> 26:16.720]  It's kind of a weird question.
[26:16.720 --> 26:21.560]  Being friends with so many breeders, so many seed makers, sellers, I'm friends with all
[26:21.560 --> 26:22.560]  of the industry.
[26:22.560 --> 26:23.560]  I go to all of the events.
[26:23.560 --> 26:27.320]  I look at all the people, shake their hands, see their faces, high five, fist bumps, hugs
[26:27.320 --> 26:28.360]  all around.
[26:28.360 --> 26:32.440]  So picking a couple of people to recommend that you buy their stuff is really kind of
[26:32.440 --> 26:34.080]  putting me on the spot.
[26:34.080 --> 26:38.520]  But I chose a couple of people that I would recommend for you because their crosses have
[26:38.520 --> 26:40.040]  my attention.
[26:40.040 --> 26:44.840]  The plants they're working with, uh, the starting plants they're growing, breeding with the
[26:44.840 --> 26:49.720]  plants they have been working with, back crossing F2ing, their stock is great.
[26:49.720 --> 26:52.360]  The outcome from their stock has always been great.
[26:52.360 --> 26:53.760]  I like the turt profiles.
[26:53.760 --> 26:55.000]  I like the potency.
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.420]  I like the people.
[26:56.420 --> 27:01.040]  So let's talk a little bit about, um, breeders that I would recommend right now.
[27:01.040 --> 27:05.160]  There's a breeder that kind of snuck up out of nowhere, uh, came out of nowhere recently,
[27:05.160 --> 27:07.080]  probably the last couple of years.
[27:07.080 --> 27:08.400]  I see a lot of breeders.
[27:08.400 --> 27:09.480]  I see a lot of things.
[27:09.480 --> 27:13.400]  I really think that, uh, Seattle chronic needs more attention.
[27:13.400 --> 27:17.520]  If you had some points to spend, I would give Seattle chronic a chance on some seeds.
[27:17.520 --> 27:18.880]  They've got a lot of great stuff.
[27:18.880 --> 27:22.520]  I've talked to them on a couple of podcasts, seen the way that they do things.
[27:22.520 --> 27:27.800]  Lots of selection, lots of rigorous testing, uh, lots of ideas going into their projects,
[27:27.800 --> 27:29.220]  lots of thought.
[27:29.220 --> 27:31.320]  So check out Seattle chronic seeds.
[27:31.320 --> 27:36.120]  I would recommend them good people, uh, great projects, good seeds.
[27:36.120 --> 27:38.760]  Then, um, check out, uh, exotic exotic.
[27:38.760 --> 27:39.920]  Mike has got some good shit.
[27:39.920 --> 27:42.280]  You guys, I like what exotic Mike breeds.
[27:42.280 --> 27:45.640]  Uh, Mike and I aren't even like best of friends, exotic Mike.
[27:45.640 --> 27:46.640]  We see each other at events.
[27:46.640 --> 27:47.640]  We do that.
[27:47.640 --> 27:48.640]  What's up, bro.
[27:48.640 --> 27:50.440]  But we're both so busy that it's just like a, Hey, there he is.
[27:50.440 --> 27:51.440]  Hey, there he is.
[27:51.440 --> 27:55.640]  And we keep moving because our boots are hopping, but exotic Mike makes good shit.
[27:55.640 --> 27:58.600]  There's a reason why that dude's got a fucking table full of cannabis cups.
[27:58.600 --> 28:01.920]  When you go to the events shop with exotic Mike, you can't go wrong.
[28:01.920 --> 28:06.760]  Um, another breeder that I like and, uh, I like his attitude.
[28:06.760 --> 28:08.080]  I like his style.
[28:08.080 --> 28:09.080]  I like him as a person.
[28:09.080 --> 28:10.080]  And that sounds weird.
[28:10.080 --> 28:11.960]  It sounds like I got a fucking man crush on the dude.
[28:12.640 --> 28:14.080]  I appreciate the guy.
[28:14.080 --> 28:17.880]  I like the way that, uh, if he wants to compliment you, you'll get a compliment.
[28:17.880 --> 28:23.200]  Also, if he needs to tell you to go fuck yourself, he will flat out tell you, Hey, go fuck yourself.
[28:23.200 --> 28:25.720]  But I want to give a shout out to JJ from top dog.
[28:25.720 --> 28:27.380]  I would recommend top dog seeds.
[28:27.380 --> 28:28.640]  Those are good seeds.
[28:28.640 --> 28:32.120]  I am breeding with the, uh, chem de la chem.
[28:32.120 --> 28:35.800]  The chem D two I-95 is a fucking great plant.
[28:35.800 --> 28:36.960]  It is stanky.
[28:36.960 --> 28:38.280]  It grows super vigorous.
[28:38.280 --> 28:39.880]  It makes trichomes and veg.
[28:39.880 --> 28:41.720]  Uh, that is a good fucking plant.
[28:42.480 --> 28:46.680]  Also the exotic Mike I bred with the cookies and cream number 13.
[28:46.680 --> 28:48.120]  That plant was fucking amazing.
[28:48.120 --> 28:49.680]  That is what made the cream.
[28:49.680 --> 28:51.640]  So I'm working with these guys projects.
[28:51.640 --> 28:56.180]  I haven't worked with, I haven't bred with Seattle chronic seeds yet, but that may happen
[28:56.180 --> 28:57.180]  in the future.
[28:57.180 --> 29:00.440]  They do, uh, CBD leaning stuff and a whole bunch of different stuff.
[29:00.440 --> 29:04.360]  Their breeding is a little bit, uh, not what I'm doing, which is totally fine, but I do
[29:04.360 --> 29:06.280]  recommend them good shit.
[29:06.280 --> 29:09.260]  Then I would be doing everybody a disservice.
[29:09.260 --> 29:14.020]  If I didn't say to get yourself some seeds from miss Jill, miss Jill is putting out some
[29:14.020 --> 29:15.220]  great crosses lately.
[29:15.220 --> 29:16.420]  She is available on seeds here.
[29:16.420 --> 29:21.340]  Now I would definitely say get some stuff from miss Jill.
[29:21.340 --> 29:24.380]  Then I've got to recommend another Colorado boy.
[29:24.380 --> 29:28.100]  Uh, people are going to send me thumbs up and thumbs downs for this recommendation,
[29:28.100 --> 29:29.820]  but that's how the world works.
[29:29.820 --> 29:34.980]  Um, there's a reason why when you go to the endo expo, the cannabis cups, any canvas related
[29:34.980 --> 29:39.060]  event, there's a reason why some people have gigantic fucking boots and lines out the door.
[29:39.580 --> 29:43.540]  And you can't deny success and quality when you see it.
[29:43.540 --> 29:47.180]  And I'm going to say that if you need some seeds from seeds here now, and you've got
[29:47.180 --> 29:49.300]  some coupons, check out the ethos seeds.
[29:49.300 --> 29:52.060]  What do they call themselves on their ethos genetics?
[29:52.060 --> 29:54.020]  I used to know them as the ethos collective.
[29:54.020 --> 29:58.140]  I just know them as their names, but, uh, check out ethos seeds.
[29:58.140 --> 30:00.140]  A lot of people are going to have feedback on that.
[30:00.140 --> 30:01.700]  Again, I'm talking about the seeds.
[30:01.700 --> 30:02.820]  I'm not talking about the people.
[30:02.820 --> 30:04.760]  I'm not talking about any of that stuff.
[30:04.760 --> 30:09.920]  When you go to the events, you will notice that ethos has a line out the door.
[30:09.920 --> 30:13.080]  They've got one of the biggest booths, one of the biggest crowds, one of the longest
[30:13.080 --> 30:14.080]  lines.
[30:14.080 --> 30:15.520]  And that can't be a hoax.
[30:15.520 --> 30:17.960]  That can't be, um, a hoax is the word.
[30:17.960 --> 30:20.800]  There's another word I'm looking for, but, uh, I can't be a fuck.
[30:20.800 --> 30:23.360]  We're just going to say a hoax.
[30:23.360 --> 30:28.080]  Somebody sent me the word I'm looking for.
[30:28.080 --> 30:29.140]  It was in my coconut water.
[30:29.140 --> 30:30.860]  The word I'm looking for that can't be a fluke.
[30:30.860 --> 30:32.780]  I just had to take a drink and I found it.
[30:32.780 --> 30:33.780]  All right.
[30:33.780 --> 30:34.780]  Is that on camera?
[30:34.780 --> 30:35.780]  I'll move that out of the camera.
[30:36.660 --> 30:37.160]  All right.
[30:37.160 --> 30:42.340]  So, uh, check out exotic genetics, top dog genetics, Seattle chronic, miss Jill, and
[30:42.340 --> 30:44.820]  the always controversial ethos genetics.
[30:44.820 --> 30:48.340]  Uh, if they won't let you stack up your, your discount codes.
[30:48.340 --> 30:52.580]  Um, but always, always, always go with IRI genetics.
[30:52.580 --> 30:55.920]  You know, the guy, you know, the guy that breeds those seeds.
[30:55.920 --> 31:00.020]  Something I like is, uh, when you're buying the seeds, I like knowing who's behind it.
[31:00.020 --> 31:01.340]  Like a jinx proof.
[31:01.340 --> 31:02.340]  I know jinx.
[31:02.340 --> 31:05.340]  I don't know if jinx is available on seeds here now is why I didn't say jinx proof.
[31:05.340 --> 31:09.300]  But if jinx is on seeds here now by jinx proof seeds, a jinx proof is a great dude.
[31:09.300 --> 31:10.300]  Shout out jinx.
[31:10.300 --> 31:14.820]  He shot out a miss Rose, a big shout out to little jinx and the whole, uh, the whole jinx
[31:14.820 --> 31:18.340]  he crew down there, out there, um, by jinx proof seeds.
[31:18.340 --> 31:19.340]  He's a good dude.
[31:19.340 --> 31:20.540]  Uh, he's got a family.
[31:20.540 --> 31:24.620]  You see him raise his family with the money he makes from his seeds, which feels good.
[31:24.620 --> 31:28.700]  You know that you're taking care of jinx, he miss Rose and little jinx.
[31:28.700 --> 31:30.420]  Who, uh, is autistic.
[31:30.420 --> 31:35.100]  So they're buying a lot of iPads and things to help other autistic children.
[31:35.860 --> 31:37.260]  So help out jinx, support jinx proof.
[31:37.260 --> 31:40.340]  I'm not sure if he's available on seeds here now, but that's a good dude.
[31:40.340 --> 31:41.340]  Good breeder.
[31:41.340 --> 31:42.340]  I always see him at events.
[31:42.340 --> 31:43.340]  I always say what's up.
[31:43.340 --> 31:44.340]  Always give him a high five.
[31:44.340 --> 31:47.220]  So I like knowing the breeders that I'm buying seeds from.
[31:47.220 --> 31:49.120]  We see miss Jill on social media.
[31:49.120 --> 31:52.260]  If you've got a question for miss Jill, you can send her a message on Instagram.
[31:52.260 --> 31:53.260]  You can talk to her.
[31:53.260 --> 31:55.180]  She's an approachable real person.
[31:55.180 --> 32:00.480]  I like that in the breeders that I'm working with that I recommend, uh, JJ from a top dog.
[32:00.480 --> 32:01.480]  He's at the events.
[32:01.480 --> 32:02.980]  Walk up to him, say what's up exotic.
[32:02.980 --> 32:05.500]  The mic exotic mic is at the events.
[32:05.500 --> 32:07.260]  He's the big dude with the beard and the glasses.
[32:07.260 --> 32:08.260]  You can't with the sunglasses.
[32:08.260 --> 32:09.500]  You can't fucking miss him.
[32:09.500 --> 32:10.500]  Go say what's up.
[32:10.500 --> 32:11.580]  He'll talk to you about his strains.
[32:11.580 --> 32:15.980]  I like the breeders who show their faces, who are out there, who are there.
[32:15.980 --> 32:18.020]  Uh, James loud is out there.
[32:18.020 --> 32:21.220]  The people that you could see their faces, Adam Dunn's got his own podcast.
[32:21.220 --> 32:22.220]  I respect that.
[32:22.220 --> 32:25.820]  If you put your face out there, that just shows you're not hiding behind the internet,
[32:25.820 --> 32:26.820]  hiding behind your logo.
[32:26.820 --> 32:29.140]  There are a lot of breeders that we don't know what they look like.
[32:29.140 --> 32:30.400]  We don't know who they are.
[32:30.400 --> 32:32.420]  Some of them, we haven't even heard their real voices.
[32:32.860 --> 32:34.860]  I like it when it's transparent.
[32:34.860 --> 32:35.980]  That does a lot for me.
[32:35.980 --> 32:36.980]  Business wise.
[32:36.980 --> 32:39.060]  Uh, it's not, it's not illegal anymore.
[32:39.060 --> 32:40.540]  It's not the fucking black market.
[32:40.540 --> 32:41.660]  It's not the dark ages.
[32:41.660 --> 32:42.860]  It's not the dark web.
[32:42.860 --> 32:43.860]  I'm right here.
[32:43.860 --> 32:44.860]  I'm Rasta Jeff.
[32:44.860 --> 32:46.360]  I read genetics, premium seeds.
[32:46.360 --> 32:47.360]  That should mean a lot to people.
[32:47.360 --> 32:48.780]  It means a lot to me as well.
[32:48.780 --> 32:53.300]  I'm fucking high and rambly and we're not even going to edit this.
[32:53.300 --> 32:54.380]  So let's keep on going.
[32:54.380 --> 32:55.900]  I've got another great question.
[32:55.900 --> 32:58.320]  I want to do one more before we wrap this up.
[32:58.320 --> 33:02.400]  This one comes from sticky Randy's garden and it goes a lot like this.
[33:03.380 --> 33:04.380]  Oh, okay.
[33:04.380 --> 33:05.380]  It says I'm selecting.
[33:05.380 --> 33:06.640]  It's not even what it says.
[33:06.640 --> 33:10.040]  It just says selecting the right plants for a perpetual grow.
[33:10.040 --> 33:14.100]  So this person is asking about selecting the right plants for a perpetual grow.
[33:14.100 --> 33:18.840]  It says right now I'm dealing with a sassy OG Kush Fino who is super sensitive to light
[33:18.840 --> 33:22.800]  and forcing me to raise my lights to keep her from drying out while my other Finos are
[33:22.800 --> 33:25.240]  doing fine under this same intensity.
[33:25.240 --> 33:26.840]  Oh, that is frustrating.
[33:26.840 --> 33:28.360]  I know that struggle.
[33:28.360 --> 33:32.560]  It says in her defense, I could have seen this coming as she grew thinner leaves and
[33:32.560 --> 33:37.680]  a less filled canopy than my other Finos of the same strain.
[33:37.680 --> 33:39.260]  So there are a couple of things to talk about right there.
[33:39.260 --> 33:43.720]  They want advice on selecting the correct plants for a perpetual grow because obviously
[33:43.720 --> 33:47.800]  this sassy OG Kush phenotype is being a little bitch in there.
[33:47.800 --> 33:54.040]  I think you've already learned your lesson, but the challenge is have you ran these phenotypes
[33:54.040 --> 33:55.040]  before?
[33:55.040 --> 33:56.040]  Are you doing a Fino hunt?
[33:56.040 --> 33:59.160]  If you're doing that first Fino hunt, I just want them small to see what I've got.
[33:59.160 --> 34:00.640]  Then you know what you're working with.
[34:00.640 --> 34:06.400]  Then select plants that run similarly for your perpetual grow.
[34:06.400 --> 34:09.560]  Plants that definitely grow the same height.
[34:09.560 --> 34:12.080]  Plants that grow kind of the same structure.
[34:12.080 --> 34:13.720]  That way you can plan that.
[34:13.720 --> 34:17.360]  If you've got, I'm just going to hypothetically guess that you've got a five by five and you're
[34:17.360 --> 34:20.480]  doing one plant here in each corner, one here, one here, one here.
[34:20.480 --> 34:22.320]  You got four plants.
[34:22.320 --> 34:24.360]  Try to have plants that grow about the same height.
[34:24.360 --> 34:26.040]  They grow the same bushyness.
[34:26.040 --> 34:30.160]  That way all of your plants are the same diameter, taking up the same amount of space in your
[34:30.160 --> 34:31.240]  grow.
[34:31.240 --> 34:35.640]  Try to get plants that like the same type of VPD.
[34:35.640 --> 34:40.320]  In an ideal world, we would lower temperatures later in flower, but you can't do that because
[34:40.320 --> 34:42.100]  you've got other plants in there.
[34:42.100 --> 34:46.400]  So you need to find plants that are happy with the same VPD throughout their entire
[34:46.400 --> 34:47.400]  growth cycle.
[34:47.400 --> 34:51.320]  That way we can have plants at week one of flower, plants at week three of flower.
[34:51.320 --> 34:54.280]  I'm not sure your staggered cycles, but you get what I'm saying.
[34:54.280 --> 34:58.920]  We need plants happy at week one, week three, week five, week seven and week nine because
[34:58.920 --> 35:01.080]  you got plants of all different stages in there.
[35:01.080 --> 35:05.080]  We need to find the appropriate plants that match up well together.
[35:05.080 --> 35:09.400]  I hate to say this because it sounds like you want to run multiple phenotypes and multiple
[35:09.400 --> 35:14.280]  plants in there, but if you want to run this perpetual and maximize it to its full potential,
[35:14.280 --> 35:21.240]  you may want to monocrop, which means stick to one strain in that room or find two strains
[35:21.320 --> 35:23.480]  that work very well together.
[35:23.480 --> 35:26.640]  And maybe you've got a longer one and a shorter one.
[35:26.640 --> 35:29.360]  So you can do one for like 60 days and one for 70.
[35:29.360 --> 35:33.000]  That way you got a crop that's ready and then you got a crop you kind of got to wait on
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.920]  and then the next one it's ready and then you got to kind of got to wait on the next
[35:35.920 --> 35:36.920]  one.
[35:36.920 --> 35:37.920]  Get your rhythm figured out.
[35:37.920 --> 35:41.920]  But you're going to want plants probably that finish around the same amount of time.
[35:41.920 --> 35:46.700]  Plants that want the same amount of VPD through the entire growth cycle.
[35:46.700 --> 35:51.100]  Plants that want the same VPD as each other so that you can get it right for this plant
[35:51.120 --> 35:52.120]  and this plant.
[35:52.120 --> 35:57.240]  It's really hard trying to dial in the room for like do-si-do and platinum tangy at the
[35:57.240 --> 35:58.240]  same time.
[35:58.240 --> 35:59.360]  It's two different environments.
[35:59.360 --> 36:00.840]  So you're going to want plants.
[36:00.840 --> 36:03.400]  It's all about finding the plants that work well together.
[36:03.400 --> 36:08.520]  You might want to do a chill out on the perpetual and do a pheno hunt and then find a couple
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.820]  of phenotypes that work well together and then start the perpetual over once you've
[36:12.820 --> 36:16.600]  got those phenos selected and dialed in.
[36:16.600 --> 36:21.460]  Find plants that grow with similar height, shape, structure.
[36:21.460 --> 36:22.460]  Just similar plants.
[36:22.460 --> 36:26.340]  You got to have plants that work well together in there.
[36:26.340 --> 36:28.100]  Unfortunately I don't know what you have access to.
[36:28.100 --> 36:32.780]  It sounds like you're growing from seed because it said you could have seen this coming because
[36:32.780 --> 36:33.860]  other phenos in the room.
[36:33.860 --> 36:35.620]  So you must be growing from seed.
[36:35.620 --> 36:37.740]  So find a couple of phenotypes that work best for you.
[36:37.740 --> 36:40.180]  That is the best part about doing selections.
[36:40.180 --> 36:45.540]  You can find things that are vastly different in buzz and flavor and aroma but still that
[36:45.540 --> 36:47.560]  grow very similarly.
[36:47.560 --> 36:53.420]  Prana is going to stay kind of short and squat and it's going to have that hippie incense
[36:53.420 --> 36:54.820]  sort of a flavor to it.
[36:54.820 --> 36:58.000]  If you put morning dew next to it, it would grow very well next to it.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  They would work very well in a perpetual together.
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.780]  Similar feed, similar VPD but the buzz and flavor and aroma are going to be way different.
[37:05.780 --> 37:07.960]  So something like that may work for you.
[37:07.960 --> 37:12.320]  Blue raspberry truffle and strawberry starburst, they grow similarly but their buzz and their
[37:12.320 --> 37:15.380]  flavor are so different that that would work well for you.
[37:16.220 --> 37:19.100]  So those would also work well if you want to run one big room together.
[37:19.100 --> 37:22.060]  Do the blue raspberry truffle and strawberry starburst together.
[37:22.060 --> 37:25.660]  But if you want to do that perpetual, you're going to have to find strains that all work
[37:25.660 --> 37:28.420]  on the schedule, on the cycle.
[37:28.420 --> 37:31.460]  Don't go into this starting perpetually.
[37:31.460 --> 37:34.380]  Keep in mind that there are steps.
[37:34.380 --> 37:36.140]  You've got to find your phenotypes.
[37:36.140 --> 37:38.220]  You've got to dial in your phenotypes.
[37:38.220 --> 37:41.900]  You've got to learn every detail of that girl.
[37:41.900 --> 37:45.900]  This is like having multiple girlfriends in one room which is going to be a challenge
[37:45.900 --> 37:49.260]  because one girl probably wants to listen to this kind of music and the other girl wants
[37:49.260 --> 37:50.580]  to listen to this kind of music.
[37:50.580 --> 37:53.760]  You've got to find the music right in the middle for both of those girls or you've got
[37:53.760 --> 37:58.340]  to find two girls that both want to listen to fish and reggae all day long and they've
[37:58.340 --> 38:01.780]  got to be careful and okay with being in the same room together.
[38:01.780 --> 38:03.180]  So that's where your challenge is.
[38:03.180 --> 38:06.020]  You've got to find the plants that are perfect for your room.
[38:06.020 --> 38:09.740]  So don't think that the first, don't think you're going to pop seeds and start a perpetual
[38:09.740 --> 38:10.740]  grow.
[38:10.740 --> 38:16.420]  So pop seeds, find phenotypes, select two phenotypes, dial in those phenotypes, then
[38:16.420 --> 38:19.780]  with the dialed in information, start the perpetual there.
[38:19.780 --> 38:24.500]  I feel like we jump in with big plans, big ideas a little bit too early sometimes when
[38:24.500 --> 38:25.940]  it comes to cannabis growing.
[38:25.940 --> 38:31.380]  So have a goal, have a strategy, select your phenotypes that way, then set up the perpetual
[38:31.380 --> 38:32.380]  grow.
[38:32.380 --> 38:33.380]  Go in steps.
[38:33.380 --> 38:35.980]  Don't try to knock out too many goals all at one time.
[38:35.980 --> 38:37.540]  That I think will really help you out.
[38:37.540 --> 38:40.340]  All right, my buddy Sticky Randy's Garden, I hope I helped you out.
[38:40.940 --> 38:43.140]  I hope we get your garden sticky and perpetual.
[38:43.140 --> 38:46.580]  If you've got any more questions, I do look forward to hearing from you.
[38:46.580 --> 38:50.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[38:50.500 --> 38:56.460]  cutters, pollen chuckers, skateboarders, fruit booters, all you sexy cannabis growers out
[38:56.460 --> 39:00.660]  there, I want to thank each and every one of you for listening to episode 626 of the

[39:05.980 --> 39:08.380]  If you had as much fun as I did, maybe you learned something.
[39:08.420 --> 39:11.700]  Maybe you felt like the podcast was educational or entertaining.

[39:47.060 --> 39:49.080]  Let me apologize right now.
[39:49.080 --> 39:53.380]  My New Year's resolution was to be better at answering emails.
[39:53.380 --> 39:55.780]  Then you guys got better at sending emails.
[39:55.780 --> 39:56.780]  I'm trying.
[39:56.780 --> 39:58.860]  There's one of me and there are thousands of you.
[39:58.860 --> 39:59.860]  I love you all.
[39:59.860 --> 40:03.580]  I will answer all of your messages, but keep in mind it's just me.
[40:03.580 --> 40:05.100]  I don't have an intern.
[40:05.100 --> 40:06.980]  I don't have a secretary.
[40:06.980 --> 40:08.420]  I don't have a clone.
[40:08.420 --> 40:09.420]  It's just me.
[40:09.420 --> 40:11.020]  I'm trying to get to all of the messages.
[40:11.020 --> 40:14.060]  Please do not stop sending them, but keep in mind it's just me.
[40:14.060 --> 40:15.060]  I'm not ignoring you.
[40:15.060 --> 40:16.060]  I'm not dissing you.
[40:16.060 --> 40:17.260]  I'm not mad at you.
[40:17.260 --> 40:18.980]  I don't have an attitude with you.
[40:18.980 --> 40:20.940]  I want to get to your messages.
[40:20.940 --> 40:21.940]  Trust me.
[40:21.940 --> 40:24.020]  I need 36 hours in my days.
[40:24.020 --> 40:25.560]  24 is cool.
[40:25.560 --> 40:27.500]  Give me another 12 hours a day.
[40:27.500 --> 40:29.540]  I might catch up on emails, but thank you.
[40:29.540 --> 40:30.540]  Keep sending them.
[40:30.540 --> 40:34.340]  Also, make sure you check out my website, iReedGenetics.com.
[40:34.340 --> 40:38.900]  Anything you want to know, iReed Genetics related, Grow From Your Heart podcast related,

[40:42.300 --> 40:46.620]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends, foes, I already
[40:46.620 --> 40:47.620]  did that part.
[40:47.620 --> 40:48.620]  I want to thank you again for listening.
[40:48.620 --> 40:51.020]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[40:51.020 --> 40:56.140]  I want to send a giant shout out to my friend at Sacred Tree Organic Farms.
[40:56.140 --> 40:59.540]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
