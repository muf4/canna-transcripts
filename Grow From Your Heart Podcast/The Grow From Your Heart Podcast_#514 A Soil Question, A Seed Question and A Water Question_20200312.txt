[00:43.040 --> 00:46.640]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:46.640 --> 00:52.840]  Today, I've been taking dabs of George Washington OG batter from my friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:52.880 --> 01:01.360]  On the label, it says this product contains 66.7% THC and 79.3% total cannabinoids.
[01:01.360 --> 01:03.620]  I'm giving it a fresh smell right now.
[01:03.620 --> 01:09.840]  In my opinion, this smells like dank OG kush with a hint of health food store in the background.
[01:09.840 --> 01:13.320]  That may sound crazy to some people, but if you've ever walked into that hippie health
[01:13.320 --> 01:16.800]  food store in your neighborhood, it's got that very specific smell.
[01:16.800 --> 01:21.960]  I think the George Washington has the OG kush plus health food store.
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.200]  One thing I can for sure mention is it has given me tremendous cotton mouth.
[01:26.200 --> 01:31.080]  Every time I dab this, I get fucking wicked heavy cotton mouth and I also get heavy, heavy
[01:31.080 --> 01:33.000]  eyes and nice and stoned.
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.440]  I'm really enjoying the George Washington OG batter, so big shout out to my friends
[01:37.440 --> 01:39.120]  at Apothecary Farms.
[01:39.120 --> 01:43.720]  All right, in this quick Thursday episode, I'm going to read listener emails.
[01:43.720 --> 01:48.240]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends who support the show
[01:48.240 --> 01:49.800]  on Patreon.
[01:49.800 --> 01:52.760]  Let's start off with a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:52.760 --> 01:56.280]  Shout out a fist bump and a bong rip to my buddy Godfather Kush.
[01:56.280 --> 01:59.360]  Let's pass a big fat joint over to my buddy Cess Burton.
[01:59.360 --> 02:02.640]  I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to my buddy The
[02:02.640 --> 02:03.640]  Corporate Rebel.
[02:03.640 --> 02:08.240]  How about a big Grow From Your Heart podcast bong rip and a dab to my buddy Bobby C.
[02:08.240 --> 02:11.160]  Let's send a big high five and a fist bump over to Xavier.
[02:11.160 --> 02:13.920]  I always want to send a shout out to my friend Cosmo.
[02:13.920 --> 02:17.480]  Let's roll up a big old fat joint and pass it over to my buddy Jacob W.
[02:17.520 --> 02:20.760]  How about a big Grow From Your Heart high five to my friend Redbeard?
[02:20.760 --> 02:26.440]  And last but certainly not least, let's pack up a fresh bowl for my buddy Todd K.
[02:26.440 --> 02:31.160]  Big shout out and big thank you to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[02:31.160 --> 02:34.560]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[02:34.560 --> 02:41.080]  all you need to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:41.080 --> 02:44.100]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:44.100 --> 02:48.660]  And of course I did include a link in the show notes or in the video description.
[02:48.660 --> 02:53.140]  All right, I think that covers most of the business for the start of the show.
[02:53.140 --> 02:56.780]  Before we get to the emails, let's do a quick garden update.
[02:56.780 --> 03:00.940]  I like to update you what's happening in the iReed Genetics breeding garden quite often.
[03:00.940 --> 03:04.980]  If you've been following along, you know that I recently pollinated a bunch of plants.
[03:04.980 --> 03:09.580]  I'm sure you heard the episode where I sounded like I just snorted a bunch of pollen because
[03:09.580 --> 03:10.620]  I basically did.
[03:10.620 --> 03:12.020]  My face was filled with pollen.
[03:12.020 --> 03:13.020]  My eyes were itchy.
[03:13.020 --> 03:14.020]  My nose was runny.
[03:14.020 --> 03:15.020]  My throat felt weird.
[03:15.020 --> 03:16.020]  I was coated in pollen.
[03:16.020 --> 03:18.540]  I had to take several showers to get that stuff off of me.
[03:18.540 --> 03:23.220]  It was well worth it because we have got a successfully pollinated garden.
[03:23.220 --> 03:29.520]  Again, I used the King Solomon male to pollinate a bunch of my favorite females to replenish
[03:29.520 --> 03:33.960]  and restock a bunch of the popular iReed Genetics stuff that moves very quickly.
[03:33.960 --> 03:39.580]  And I did make one or two more new crosses in that room in that time period.
[03:39.580 --> 03:41.340]  I did put the Mac 1 cut.
[03:41.340 --> 03:43.340]  I've got the Mac 1 from Capulator.
[03:43.340 --> 03:44.580]  I put that in the room.
[03:44.580 --> 03:45.820]  I pollinated it.
[03:45.820 --> 03:49.220]  It does appear to have made several seeds.
[03:49.220 --> 03:54.420]  I pollinated the Mac in another run and it only made very few seeds.
[03:54.420 --> 03:57.340]  It does appear that I've made more seed this time.
[03:57.340 --> 04:00.860]  However, I cannot be certain until it is harvest time.
[04:00.860 --> 04:05.900]  So I'm fairly excited to have more Mac 1 to arise seeds.
[04:05.900 --> 04:07.460]  We will see how that goes.
[04:07.460 --> 04:11.860]  And I'm also excited for that other secret cross that is in there that has never been
[04:11.860 --> 04:14.700]  pollinated by King Solomon before.
[04:14.700 --> 04:18.700]  I've also acquired a new grow space where I hung up two LED lights.
[04:18.700 --> 04:21.940]  Big shout out to my friend at Black Sale for the two Canon LEDs.
[04:21.940 --> 04:24.060]  I don't have any plants to put under them.
[04:24.060 --> 04:28.320]  That grow space is not running just yet, but as soon as it is going, I will give you guys
[04:28.320 --> 04:32.540]  updates on my progress test running LED lights.
[04:32.540 --> 04:36.380]  I've been growing with HID lights for the majority of my grow career.
[04:36.380 --> 04:37.900]  I've played with some T5s.
[04:37.900 --> 04:41.260]  I've experimented with mainly metal halides and high pressure sodiums.
[04:41.260 --> 04:46.540]  I really prefer the Govitas, but I was given two Canon LEDs and I feel like they are going
[04:46.540 --> 04:50.300]  to work perfectly in a small grow environment.
[04:50.300 --> 04:54.260]  I took the lights out of the box and I plugged them in and they are some of the brightest
[04:54.260 --> 04:56.100]  lights I have ever seen.
[04:56.100 --> 05:01.180]  I know brightness isn't everything, but they made me squint and I spend a lot of time around
[05:01.180 --> 05:05.140]  grow lights and I noticed that they are ridiculously bright.
[05:05.140 --> 05:06.400]  So I will keep you updated.
[05:06.400 --> 05:09.060]  I will let you know how the pollinated room goes.
[05:09.060 --> 05:11.620]  I will let you know how the Mac 1 pollination goes.
[05:11.620 --> 05:15.860]  I'll let you know how many seeds I get from that and I will also let you know how I feel
[05:15.860 --> 05:19.580]  about the LEDs once I start growing underneath those lights.
[05:19.580 --> 05:21.500]  All right, that's what's going on in my grow.
[05:21.500 --> 05:23.380]  Those are all of the updates to cover.
[05:23.380 --> 05:27.100]  Let's jump into the email portion of this episode.
[05:27.100 --> 05:31.100]  If anybody out there has a cannabis culture or a cannabis cultivation question, I would
[05:31.100 --> 05:32.100]  love to hear from you.
[05:32.100 --> 05:33.100]  Send me an email.
[05:33.100 --> 05:36.540]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[05:36.540 --> 05:42.020]  The first email in today's episode goes just like this.
[05:42.020 --> 05:43.260]  What up Rasta Jeff?
[05:43.260 --> 05:46.820]  Feel free to mention my name if this so happens to make it on the show.
[05:46.820 --> 05:47.820]  What's up Thor?
[05:47.820 --> 05:48.820]  Thank you for the great message.
[05:48.820 --> 05:53.820]  It goes on to say, I found your podcast through the Dude Grows podcast and I have to say that
[05:53.820 --> 05:56.940]  your show is my favorite and I listen to all of your shit.
[05:56.940 --> 05:59.620]  So thank you for the content and knowledge.
[05:59.620 --> 06:00.620]  That's awesome man.
[06:00.620 --> 06:01.620]  Thank you.
[06:01.620 --> 06:05.220]  I'm glad that the Dude Grows show is spreading the good word since they are getting me new
[06:05.220 --> 06:06.220]  followers.
[06:06.900 --> 06:07.900]  Let's talk about them for a moment.
[06:07.900 --> 06:10.220]  Make sure you are following the Dude Grows show.
[06:10.220 --> 06:12.740]  They're great folks, good people, very good show.
[06:12.740 --> 06:15.500]  If you like my show, you will like the Dude Grows show.
[06:15.500 --> 06:17.820]  Give them a click, give them a subscribe.
[06:17.820 --> 06:19.020]  I bet you will enjoy it.
[06:19.020 --> 06:23.300]  So big shout out to our friend Thor for finding us through the DGC.
[06:23.300 --> 06:26.500]  And dude, you are very welcome for all of the content and knowledge.
[06:26.500 --> 06:27.980]  I appreciate the respect.
[06:27.980 --> 06:31.780]  It goes on to say, I need a little help with my grow tent.
[06:31.780 --> 06:35.140]  This is my second grow and I'm growing in a four by six tent.
[06:35.140 --> 06:40.100]  I have a four inch carbon filter and fan hooked up above my tent inside.
[06:40.100 --> 06:43.860]  I also have a six inch inline fan for bringing air into the tent.
[06:43.860 --> 06:47.900]  I have two fans on the inside and my light is a, where is it?
[06:47.900 --> 06:50.780]  A 400 watt spectrum king LED.
[06:50.780 --> 06:52.140]  Temperatures stay around 82.
[06:52.140 --> 06:54.220]  I would get that a little bit lower if you can.
[06:54.220 --> 06:57.380]  It says RH stays around 40%.
[06:57.380 --> 06:59.140]  That will work for part of your flower phase.
[06:59.140 --> 07:01.620]  You may want to work on VPD a little bit, but that's okay.
[07:01.620 --> 07:03.320]  That's going to work for you for now.
[07:03.320 --> 07:07.120]  It says I am steadily trying to upgrade as I go.
[07:07.120 --> 07:12.000]  Currently I'm looking into RO filters because I'm having to go fill up water jugs three
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  times a week at Walmart.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.440]  Do you have any water suggestions?
[07:16.440 --> 07:18.920]  I know I have hard water where I live.
[07:18.920 --> 07:21.360]  Also does my tent sound efficient enough?
[07:21.360 --> 07:25.360]  What are some things I should start looking into investing in?
[07:25.360 --> 07:28.960]  Eventually I'd like to run CO2 when I get everything else dialed in.
[07:28.960 --> 07:33.400]  I'm also using Fox Farms Ocean Forest Soil with advanced nutrients, bottled nutrients.
[07:33.400 --> 07:37.800]  Do you have any good recommendations on soil and nutrients?
[07:37.800 --> 07:41.480]  Any information you can throw at me will be greatly appreciated.
[07:41.480 --> 07:43.820]  Thank you for all the bad ass content.
[07:43.820 --> 07:44.820]  Keep it coming.
[07:44.820 --> 07:46.920]  Cheers, buddy from Thor.
[07:46.920 --> 07:48.960]  Thor, thank you for the great message.
[07:48.960 --> 07:52.960]  There are a lot of great points we can go over here really quickly.
[07:52.960 --> 07:54.440]  Let's address the first thing.
[07:54.440 --> 07:57.760]  The Fox Farm Ocean Forest Soil will be acceptable.
[07:57.760 --> 07:59.840]  I would prefer cocoa in my world.
[07:59.840 --> 08:04.240]  I would add some amendments to that cocoa, some perlite and some persolite.
[08:04.240 --> 08:09.200]  But then you know that I would recommend either Veg Bloom or New Millennium Nutrients.
[08:09.200 --> 08:10.600]  That's what I would recommend.
[08:10.600 --> 08:14.720]  I understand that you've probably spent a whole lot of money on those advanced nutrients
[08:14.720 --> 08:15.720]  bottles.
[08:15.720 --> 08:20.460]  So when those run out, maybe consider replacing those with some New Millennium products.
[08:20.460 --> 08:25.680]  Maybe work your way toward using the Veg Bloom line of powdered nutrients, or maybe listen
[08:25.680 --> 08:30.000]  to my mix episode and use the combination that I've suggested.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.600]  Now most of your tent setup makes sense.
[08:32.600 --> 08:36.600]  I'm not sure how much light you're getting from that 400 watt Spectrum King.
[08:36.600 --> 08:39.000]  I don't know if that's enough light for that space.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.760]  I would read what the manufacturer suggested on that.
[08:41.760 --> 08:44.280]  I would research the PPFD of that light.
[08:44.280 --> 08:48.220]  But if the light is sufficient, it sounds like most of your room makes sense.
[08:48.220 --> 08:53.100]  The part that does stand out to me is you say you've got a four inch fan and a carbon
[08:53.100 --> 08:55.560]  filter removing air from the tent.
[08:55.640 --> 09:00.040]  However, you have got a six inch fan pushing air into the tent.
[09:00.040 --> 09:05.440]  What could possibly potentially happen is you may be moving more air into that tent
[09:05.440 --> 09:11.160]  than you are pulling out of the tent, which is going to make the air come from the cracks
[09:11.160 --> 09:14.580]  and gaps in that tent where the zipper is, where the seams are.
[09:14.580 --> 09:17.260]  You're going to get air escaping from the tent.
[09:17.260 --> 09:21.840]  That air will not pass through the carbon filter and it will be odoriferous.
[09:21.840 --> 09:23.240]  It will smell like ganja.
[09:23.240 --> 09:25.360]  It will smell like your plants.
[09:25.360 --> 09:30.320]  So if I understand this correctly, you have got a four inch fan removing air and a six
[09:30.320 --> 09:32.440]  inch fan pushing air in.
[09:32.440 --> 09:37.920]  I would swap those or simply turn off the six inch fan.
[09:37.920 --> 09:44.840]  If that four inch fan is actually exhausting air from the tent, it will create enough displacement
[09:44.840 --> 09:50.200]  of air and it will bring fresh air in through that hole where you've got your six inch fan
[09:50.200 --> 09:51.200]  blowing air in.
[09:51.640 --> 09:57.560]  As much air goes out, it will have to be brought in and it will happen naturally by air displacement.
[09:57.560 --> 10:02.000]  So that is the main thing that stood out when you described your Grow2Me is that you are
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.880]  pushing more air in than you are pulling out.
[10:04.880 --> 10:07.840]  That will give you a balloon type environment in your tent.
[10:07.840 --> 10:11.680]  Your tent will swell up and then what will happen is that air will escape through the
[10:11.680 --> 10:14.720]  zipper, through the seams, through all of the other ports.
[10:14.720 --> 10:16.360]  You've got other ports for other ducting.
[10:16.360 --> 10:17.640]  You've got other flaps.
[10:17.640 --> 10:20.440]  You're going to swell it up and air is going to come out of there.
[10:20.440 --> 10:22.080]  I would rather see negative pressure.
[10:22.080 --> 10:26.080]  I would rather see all of the air being sucked through the carbon filter and then up and
[10:26.080 --> 10:29.640]  out to where the walls of the tent kind of cave in a little bit.
[10:29.640 --> 10:33.420]  That way I know that all of the air that is passing out of that tent has gone through
[10:33.420 --> 10:36.780]  my carbon filter and nobody is going to smell my plants.
[10:36.780 --> 10:39.160]  That is the main thing that stands out to me.
[10:39.160 --> 10:41.120]  Now let's get to the main part of your question.
[10:41.120 --> 10:45.720]  You were asking about RO filters because you've been driving to Walmart to fill water jugs
[10:45.720 --> 10:48.960]  three times a week and I'm sure that is getting tiresome.
[10:48.960 --> 10:53.340]  I'm sure that is not convenient and I'm sure it's starting to look a little bit suspicious.
[10:53.340 --> 10:57.160]  So let's figure out a way to keep you out of Walmart three times a week, filling up
[10:57.160 --> 11:01.000]  those jugs, looking like you've probably got to grow somewhere.
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.060]  You say you have got hard water in your location.
[11:04.060 --> 11:05.280]  Have you tested the water?
[11:05.280 --> 11:09.800]  Have you looked at the municipal water support from your water company in your area?
[11:09.800 --> 11:12.280]  They will tell you everything that is in that water.
[11:12.280 --> 11:17.160]  Have you taken a PPM meter or an EC meter and stuck it in your water after it comes
[11:17.160 --> 11:19.240]  out of the tap to see what is in there?
[11:19.240 --> 11:22.880]  It's not going to tell you what's in there, but it will tell you how much is in there.
[11:22.880 --> 11:24.680]  Have you checked the pH of that water?
[11:24.680 --> 11:27.600]  I'm very curious what is coming out of your tap.
[11:27.600 --> 11:34.640]  What I have discovered in most cases, if the water is consumable by most people, the water
[11:34.640 --> 11:38.080]  should be okay for your grow room.
[11:38.080 --> 11:42.920]  Now I do understand and I agree that we do like to have a lot of control over what goes
[11:42.920 --> 11:47.600]  into our plants and having control over the water is a big advantage.
[11:47.600 --> 11:52.400]  If you would like to go with an RO system for your home, that is a great idea.
[11:52.400 --> 11:55.080]  It does create a little bit of waste.
[11:55.080 --> 12:00.160]  Technology for RO machines has come a long way and the amount of waste has greatly been
[12:00.160 --> 12:05.640]  reduced compared to what it used to be when we were first using RO in our grows.
[12:05.640 --> 12:10.360]  RO is a great way to ensure you have got clean, neutral water.
[12:10.360 --> 12:15.160]  It's also a great way to know exactly what is going into your nutrient mix.
[12:15.160 --> 12:21.360]  It does however make it a little more challenging to stabilize the pH of your nutrient solution.
[12:21.360 --> 12:28.320]  I also think that an RO system is probably overkill in most home grow environments.
[12:28.320 --> 12:34.160]  If you were growing hydroponically or if you were growing in cocoa, I may consider RO in
[12:34.160 --> 12:35.560]  a home grow.
[12:35.560 --> 12:41.480]  In most environments, I think if you really want to filter your water, a big boy filter
[12:41.480 --> 12:43.200]  will be sufficient for you.
[12:43.200 --> 12:45.200]  It does not create a lot of waste.
[12:45.200 --> 12:47.520]  It does filter in a timely manner.
[12:47.520 --> 12:51.680]  That RO machine will take a very long time to clean the amount of water you need.
[12:51.680 --> 12:57.280]  I think a big boy filter or a small boy filter will efficiently and effectively clean your
[12:57.280 --> 12:58.900]  water for your grow.
[12:58.900 --> 13:01.140]  You are in a soilless mix environment.
[13:01.140 --> 13:05.780]  You're using Fox Farms Ocean Forest soil, so you do have a buffer zone.
[13:05.780 --> 13:09.580]  Being in that soilless mix allows you a little bit more room.
[13:09.580 --> 13:15.740]  If you were in hydroponics or cocoa, I may consider recommending the RO machine for you.
[13:15.740 --> 13:21.220]  But I really believe that in most cases, that big boy, that small boy filter will filter
[13:21.220 --> 13:26.780]  the water probably more than efficiently for what you're trying to do in your home grow.
[13:26.780 --> 13:32.140]  I set up big boy filters in most of my commercial environments because I find that the RO water
[13:32.140 --> 13:34.100]  is more wasteful than anything.
[13:34.100 --> 13:39.420]  I think that the big boy filters, they are quicker and they clean more than what we need.
[13:39.420 --> 13:43.980]  It doesn't create that excessive wastewater, which I find to be beneficial.
[13:43.980 --> 13:47.520]  We still pay for that water, even though it gets sent out as wastewater.
[13:47.520 --> 13:48.520]  It came through the line.
[13:48.520 --> 13:52.740]  We've got to pay for it, even though we cleaned it, flushed it down the toilet, basically.
[13:52.740 --> 13:58.420]  I do think that a big boy filter or a small boy filter would work efficiently for your grow.
[13:58.420 --> 14:00.100]  It's much more affordable to buy it.
[14:00.100 --> 14:04.380]  It's much more affordable to set it up, and you're not going to waste nearly as much water.
[14:04.380 --> 14:08.100]  And I do believe that it will clean the water perfectly for you.
[14:08.100 --> 14:12.100]  Now the next detail you mentioned is that you would like to run CO2 once you get everything
[14:12.100 --> 14:13.940]  else dialed in.
[14:13.940 --> 14:16.620]  That is going to be one of the last things that you're going to add.
[14:16.620 --> 14:19.900]  I would make sure that you get all of your grow technique dialed in.
[14:19.900 --> 14:22.180]  I would make sure that you get the appropriate light.
[14:22.620 --> 14:23.620]  Make sure you've got enough light in there.
[14:23.620 --> 14:26.500]  Again, I don't know if that 400 watt LED is enough light.
[14:26.500 --> 14:27.780]  It could be.
[14:27.780 --> 14:30.180]  You've got to do the research on that one.
[14:30.180 --> 14:32.060]  Get your water dialed in.
[14:32.060 --> 14:33.300]  Get your nutrients dialed in.
[14:33.300 --> 14:34.820]  Get your genetics dialed in.
[14:34.820 --> 14:39.100]  And then once you're ready for CO2, you've got to think about you are now ducting all
[14:39.100 --> 14:43.900]  of the air right out of that tent continuously because we're trying not to get humidity problems.
[14:43.900 --> 14:45.740]  We're trying not to get stagnant air.
[14:45.740 --> 14:48.100]  Try not to get temperature problems in there.
[14:48.100 --> 14:53.060]  So if you're going to introduce CO2, how are you going to keep the CO2 flowing through
[14:53.060 --> 14:55.060]  that tent without wasting it?
[14:55.060 --> 14:59.660]  You're going to have to seal up the room in which the tent is in and then CO2 the room
[14:59.660 --> 15:04.140]  and then pump the CO2 in and out of that tent continuously is what I think you'll probably
[15:04.140 --> 15:05.660]  have to do.
[15:05.660 --> 15:08.940]  Another thing I will recommend is that you add some sort of a monitor so that you can
[15:08.940 --> 15:11.900]  pay better attention to your temperature and humidity.
[15:11.900 --> 15:14.180]  82 is kind of high.
[15:14.180 --> 15:17.580]  If you're in North America, it is the winter, which means when the summer comes, you're
[15:17.580 --> 15:21.780]  going to get five to 10 degrees hotter in that grow environment.
[15:21.780 --> 15:23.420]  So let's get prepared now.
[15:23.420 --> 15:27.100]  Let's start working on cooling that room so we don't roast those plants.
[15:27.100 --> 15:30.580]  You're going to want to pay more attention to the temperature and the humidity.
[15:30.580 --> 15:36.620]  That 40% relative humidity is acceptable in most cases, but throughout flower, throughout
[15:36.620 --> 15:41.280]  veg, throughout different parts of the cycle, you may want higher, you may want lower.
[15:41.280 --> 15:46.900]  So you may want a monitor and the appropriate equipment to adjust those parameters when
[15:46.980 --> 15:47.980]  they are needed.
[15:47.980 --> 15:51.180]  A lot of people set up a grow room and they think, cool, this is set up.
[15:51.180 --> 15:53.080]  I'm going to survive through the grow.
[15:53.080 --> 15:54.080]  Let's get it going.
[15:54.080 --> 15:58.380]  And then they forget that if you live somewhere like Colorado in the summer where I live,
[15:58.380 --> 16:00.860]  it gets 110, 112 degrees.
[16:00.860 --> 16:03.380]  Then in the winter, it gets 12 degrees.
[16:03.380 --> 16:07.740]  So I've got to set up different setups for different times of the year.
[16:07.740 --> 16:10.980]  And right now we are entering the time of the year where I've got to start preparing
[16:10.980 --> 16:12.180]  for the warm season.
[16:12.180 --> 16:14.420]  Yes, it is March right now.
[16:14.420 --> 16:17.140]  As April creeps in, we'll get one or two last snow storms.
[16:17.140 --> 16:20.740]  Then when those snow storms go away, it'll start getting real warm.
[16:20.740 --> 16:23.820]  And then kapow, it gets super hot for a while.
[16:23.820 --> 16:26.740]  Then it will get super humid because we get a lot of rain.
[16:26.740 --> 16:31.140]  And then after all that rain, we get a bunch of snow and it will be cold as fuck again
[16:31.140 --> 16:33.060]  for four or five, maybe six months.
[16:33.060 --> 16:36.220]  So I am prepared for that because I've been doing this for so long.
[16:36.220 --> 16:37.220]  I can predict it.
[16:37.220 --> 16:40.700]  I can see, I watch outside, I watch the sky, pay attention to the weather.
[16:40.700 --> 16:41.820]  I know when it's coming.
[16:41.820 --> 16:43.060]  I know how to adjust.
[16:43.060 --> 16:48.340]  I've got to adjust a lot of things for seasonal grows here in Colorado, but I've been doing
[16:48.340 --> 16:50.620]  it for a while so I can foresee it.
[16:50.620 --> 16:51.860]  I can predict that shit.
[16:51.860 --> 16:55.940]  I've kind of got routines and rhythms and I know exactly what to do when the winter
[16:55.940 --> 16:57.420]  and when the summer come.
[16:57.420 --> 17:00.260]  So everybody should keep that in mind when they're setting up their grows.
[17:00.260 --> 17:04.460]  If you're building a tent, it may be the perfect environment in there now, but what happens
[17:04.460 --> 17:07.180]  in six months when the seasons are the complete opposite?
[17:07.180 --> 17:10.700]  All right, my friend, I think I answered your question more than sufficiently.
[17:11.020 --> 17:13.140]  Hey Thor, thank you for the great message.
[17:13.140 --> 17:16.180]  If you've got any follow-up questions, please reach out.
[17:16.180 --> 17:17.940]  I would love to hear from you.
[17:17.940 --> 17:20.220]  All right, I've got one more email in front of me.
[17:20.220 --> 17:21.540]  Let's jump right to it.
[17:21.540 --> 17:23.020]  It goes just like this.
[17:23.020 --> 17:25.760]  It says, hi, I've been listening to your podcast.
[17:25.760 --> 17:27.780]  Great content and quality.
[17:27.780 --> 17:29.580]  I've got a couple of questions for you.
[17:29.580 --> 17:31.980]  Hey, first of all, thank you for starting off with compliments.
[17:31.980 --> 17:33.580]  I do appreciate that.
[17:33.580 --> 17:35.300]  The questions go like this.
[17:35.300 --> 17:39.060]  I've been playing around with soil builds in the sense that I'll do a run with the same
[17:39.060 --> 17:44.500]  beans and grow them out in soils that I build using different quantities of amendments.
[17:44.500 --> 17:48.700]  I let the soil cook off so it's not too hot and that it's stable enough for the plants
[17:48.700 --> 17:51.540]  to express themselves as they see fit.
[17:51.540 --> 17:52.820]  This is a great idea.
[17:52.820 --> 17:57.540]  This is the idea behind building a super soil or maybe like a no-till type of environment.
[17:57.540 --> 17:59.740]  This person is creating a soil.
[17:59.740 --> 18:02.540]  They're getting all of the appropriate amendments together.
[18:02.540 --> 18:04.540]  They're putting it in a soil.
[18:04.540 --> 18:06.380]  They've got, I don't know what their sources are.
[18:06.380 --> 18:10.500]  We haven't gotten that far, but they have got a source of nitrogen, a source of phosphorus,
[18:10.500 --> 18:12.060]  a source of potassium.
[18:12.060 --> 18:17.180]  They've got all the macro, all the micronutrients in here from natural organic sources.
[18:17.180 --> 18:18.660]  They put it in a container.
[18:18.660 --> 18:23.820]  The soil does what we call cook for a period of time, which breaks down all of those amendments
[18:23.820 --> 18:26.440]  and makes them bioavailable to the plant.
[18:26.440 --> 18:30.140]  Then we put the plants in this soil and we don't have to feed them.
[18:30.140 --> 18:35.060]  All we have to do is water them because everything is in the soil naturally and they eat at their
[18:35.060 --> 18:36.360]  own will.
[18:36.360 --> 18:41.240]  This listener believes that this will allow the plants to express themselves as they see
[18:41.240 --> 18:46.280]  fit because we are not force feeding them chelated buffered nutrients.
[18:46.280 --> 18:51.300]  This is a very common and very realistic approach to cannabis growing and I cannot wait to get
[18:51.300 --> 18:53.480]  further into this question.
[18:53.480 --> 18:57.640]  It goes on to say, indulging in this practice has made me aware of something which brings
[18:57.640 --> 18:59.940]  me to my question.
[18:59.940 --> 19:04.720]  Different soil compositions create what seem like different terpene profiles in the same
[19:04.800 --> 19:06.920]  plants grown in them.
[19:06.920 --> 19:11.400]  If this observation is true, then my question is this.
[19:11.400 --> 19:16.280]  How does one find the plant's truest expression with today's plants that have such varied
[19:16.280 --> 19:22.520]  genetic backgrounds because of extensive crossbreeding, inbreeding, and backcrossing?
[19:22.520 --> 19:27.560]  Building a soil of its origin seems imposing and impossible.
[19:27.560 --> 19:30.200]  That my friend is the magic question.
[19:30.200 --> 19:32.360]  That is what we are all searching for.
[19:32.360 --> 19:36.480]  That is the cannabis growers never ending quest.
[19:36.480 --> 19:39.680]  What you were talking about is what I call dialing it in.
[19:39.680 --> 19:46.240]  We want to dial in, you want to dial in your soil mix so that that plant represents itself
[19:46.240 --> 19:49.460]  and expresses itself to its fullest potential.
[19:49.460 --> 19:52.200]  That is the biggest goal for a cannabis grower.
[19:52.200 --> 19:56.320]  Once you are good at getting all the basics down, that is where your brain goes.
[19:56.320 --> 20:00.500]  How do I get this plant to be the best plant it can be?
[20:00.500 --> 20:02.280]  That is how we get cup winning cannabis.
[20:02.320 --> 20:04.400]  That is how we get award winning cannabis.
[20:04.400 --> 20:07.840]  That is how we get very helpful medicine.
[20:07.840 --> 20:10.120]  People with passion like yourself.
[20:10.120 --> 20:15.320]  That my friend is the never ending quest, is to get that plant dialed in to perfection.
[20:15.320 --> 20:18.120]  I'm going to continue with more of the email and then I really want to talk about this,
[20:18.120 --> 20:21.320]  but there's more that I want to cover before I get going.
[20:21.320 --> 20:24.760]  Building a soil of its origin seems imposing and impossible.
[20:24.760 --> 20:29.440]  Yes, with all of the crossbreeding, you can get a plant that's got Afghani and Thai and
[20:29.440 --> 20:31.080]  Mexican genetics in it.
[20:31.080 --> 20:33.080]  How do I know what kind of soil to put that in?
[20:33.080 --> 20:36.960]  Because it's not from Mexico, it's not from an Afghan region, it's not from Thailand.
[20:36.960 --> 20:38.400]  I can't build that soil here.
[20:38.400 --> 20:40.240]  How do I know what to put in there?
[20:40.240 --> 20:44.400]  If I do get that right, how do I even know that the phenotype I put in there is going
[20:44.400 --> 20:45.440]  to like that mix?
[20:45.440 --> 20:47.520]  That is a very good question.
[20:47.520 --> 20:52.200]  It goes on to say, every grow I wonder what the plants could have expressed.
[20:52.200 --> 20:53.440]  It's a deep rabbit hole.
[20:53.440 --> 20:55.080]  I'm not sure what's on the other end.
[20:55.080 --> 20:58.120]  Yes, that's why I want to cover all of this before I get rambly.
[20:58.120 --> 21:02.160]  Another question, maybe you could dispel some of the myths surrounding long-term storage
[21:02.160 --> 21:03.160]  of beans.
[21:03.160 --> 21:04.760]  All right, let's not even unpack that part.
[21:04.760 --> 21:08.640]  Let's talk about the part about dialing in your soil.
[21:08.640 --> 21:13.400]  You are absolutely correct in thinking that different amendments will absolutely give
[21:13.400 --> 21:18.960]  us different colors, different aromas, different flavors, different terpene profiles, different
[21:18.960 --> 21:20.680]  cannabinoid profiles.
[21:20.680 --> 21:26.520]  It can make very many different variables in the final outcome of our plants.
[21:26.520 --> 21:31.640]  Also, everything above the soil will have a similar or different effect.
[21:31.640 --> 21:34.240]  The lights may change how your plants grow.
[21:34.240 --> 21:35.280]  I breed seeds.
[21:35.280 --> 21:38.840]  I've got the opportunity to see my seeds grown under LEDs.
[21:38.840 --> 21:40.520]  I get to see them under HPS.
[21:40.520 --> 21:42.840]  I get to see them under ceramic metal halides.
[21:42.840 --> 21:45.920]  I get to see them under makeshift ghetto grows.
[21:45.920 --> 21:48.160]  I get to see how those plants express themselves.
[21:48.160 --> 21:52.080]  I do see variation from all of those lights.
[21:52.080 --> 21:55.860]  Not only is the soil and the medium going to make a difference, but the lights will
[21:55.900 --> 21:56.900]  make a difference.
[21:56.900 --> 22:00.620]  Also, your VPD and overall environment will make a difference.
[22:00.620 --> 22:02.660]  Are you a little drier in your grow room?
[22:02.660 --> 22:05.500]  Is your grow room a little more humid or a little warmer?
[22:05.500 --> 22:10.860]  All of those things are going to make a difference in how this plant expresses itself.
[22:10.860 --> 22:14.620]  It sounds to me like you are at the stage of the game where you want to find how to
[22:14.620 --> 22:19.960]  make this plant express itself perfectly with your soil mix, which is a beautiful goal.
[22:19.960 --> 22:23.860]  You want to whip up a batch of soil and say, that is the magic mix right there.
[22:23.860 --> 22:27.540]  My plant is going to do everything it needs to do it just the right time.
[22:27.540 --> 22:32.940]  It's going to be top shelf, A grade, cup winning, magical medical marijuana.
[22:32.940 --> 22:34.180]  That's what you're looking for.
[22:34.180 --> 22:35.860]  And I admire you for that.
[22:35.860 --> 22:39.400]  Here is the way that I feel like we get to that.
[22:39.400 --> 22:41.740]  You did state that you were growing from seed.
[22:41.740 --> 22:45.740]  I like that, but we've got to grow from clone.
[22:45.740 --> 22:48.700]  Of course, start with your favorite batch of seeds.
[22:48.700 --> 22:50.540]  Let's do a basic pheno hunt.
[22:50.940 --> 22:55.020]  Let's narrow it down to one phenotype that works beautifully well for you.
[22:55.020 --> 22:58.140]  The one that is your favorite out of that pack of seeds.
[22:58.140 --> 22:59.620]  You choose what you like.
[22:59.620 --> 23:04.180]  You take what works best for you in your grow, in your pipe, in your life.
[23:04.180 --> 23:06.300]  Choose the phenotype that is your favorite.
[23:06.300 --> 23:11.500]  Now we are going to develop a relationship with that plant and that soil.
[23:11.500 --> 23:19.100]  The only way we can create any sort of scientific outcome is by doing very scientific practices.
[23:19.100 --> 23:24.380]  Let's take six clones of the same plant and put them all in different soil and see how
[23:24.380 --> 23:25.380]  they react.
[23:25.380 --> 23:26.940]  All those six different plants.
[23:26.940 --> 23:30.780]  Let's document very well what's in pot A, what's in pot B.
[23:30.780 --> 23:36.460]  If we eliminate variables, it makes it much easier to dial in to perfection.
[23:36.460 --> 23:42.220]  By eliminating the variable of different plants in the room, that now allows us to dial in
[23:42.220 --> 23:43.460]  the soil.
[23:43.460 --> 23:45.220]  Because I hate to break it to you.
[23:45.220 --> 23:51.540]  No two plants are going to be completely happy in the same soil mix.
[23:51.540 --> 23:56.420]  We like to dream that we can whip up some magic soil that's going to work for everything.
[23:56.420 --> 23:59.780]  I do not believe that that is going to be accurate.
[23:59.780 --> 24:02.820]  I say that having cannabis plants is like having girlfriends.
[24:02.820 --> 24:06.380]  You have got to learn all of their little quirks, all of their little niches.
[24:06.380 --> 24:08.980]  You've got to learn all of the details that make them happy.
[24:08.980 --> 24:12.240]  You've also got to learn all of the details that piss them off.
[24:12.240 --> 24:16.560]  You've got to avoid all of those things that piss them off and you've got to amplify all
[24:16.560 --> 24:18.600]  of the things that make them happy.
[24:18.600 --> 24:22.280]  Unless you've got a spreadsheet and a notebook and a couple of friends helping you out, it
[24:22.280 --> 24:25.080]  is very hard to dial in more than one girlfriend.
[24:25.080 --> 24:26.840]  You are not going to keep her happy.
[24:26.840 --> 24:30.680]  You've got to focus and figure out what she needs and do that shit.
[24:30.680 --> 24:33.080]  Your cannabis garden is very similar.
[24:33.080 --> 24:37.720]  Let's learn one plant, develop a relationship with it, see what it likes.
[24:37.720 --> 24:39.640]  You can't do this with one grow.
[24:39.640 --> 24:46.800]  You may need four, five, six, maybe 10 or 20 grows with the same plant to dial it to perfection.
[24:46.800 --> 24:52.280]  It sounds like that is your goal is to get a plant to express itself to its full potential,
[24:52.280 --> 24:54.960]  which would be a perfect grow.
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.800]  My recommendation is finding one clone that works beautifully for you.
[24:59.800 --> 25:03.080]  Find one environment that you're going to do this experiment in.
[25:03.080 --> 25:06.000]  Then mix up four or five different types of soil.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.120]  However many pots you can put in that room to flower, mix up that many different types
[25:10.120 --> 25:11.160]  of soil.
[25:11.160 --> 25:12.600]  Take very good notes.
[25:12.600 --> 25:18.000]  Again, label pot A, pot B, or pot one through six, however you want to do it.
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.600]  Then mark down what was in each pot very carefully.
[25:20.600 --> 25:23.080]  I put this in here, I put this in here.
[25:23.080 --> 25:27.240]  Then grow your plants all in the same environment so it is scientific.
[25:27.240 --> 25:31.800]  The only acceptable variable in this experiment is the soil.
[25:31.800 --> 25:33.560]  That is the only thing that should change.
[25:33.560 --> 25:34.720]  Do not change lights.
[25:34.720 --> 25:36.520]  Do not change pot sizes.
[25:36.520 --> 25:38.640]  Do not change frequency of watering.
[25:38.640 --> 25:39.960]  Do everything the same.
[25:39.960 --> 25:41.120]  Don't top one plant.
[25:41.120 --> 25:42.440]  Don't lollipop one.
[25:42.440 --> 25:45.840]  If you do something to one plant, do it to every plant in the room.
[25:45.840 --> 25:47.940]  Treat them all equally.
[25:47.940 --> 25:49.920]  Then pay close attention to the plants.
[25:49.920 --> 25:51.760]  Take a lot, a lot of notes.
[25:51.760 --> 25:52.980]  Take excessive notes.
[25:52.980 --> 25:55.440]  Take excessive photos if you can.
[25:55.440 --> 26:00.160]  Then use your grower intuition and your grower knowledge and grower skills to determine which
[26:00.160 --> 26:03.120]  soil is working best for your plant.
[26:03.200 --> 26:05.400]  Now, this is where the fun part comes in.
[26:05.400 --> 26:11.240]  When you dry, cure, harvest, smoke those plants, you and I may completely disagree on which
[26:11.240 --> 26:12.480]  one was better.
[26:12.480 --> 26:14.100]  That is the magic of cannabis.
[26:14.100 --> 26:17.760]  You may get that soil perfect and you may smoke it and you'll say, that's exactly what
[26:17.760 --> 26:18.760]  I was going for.
[26:18.760 --> 26:23.640]  Then I may smoke sample B that you rejected and I'll go, that's exactly what I would have
[26:23.640 --> 26:24.640]  bought.
[26:24.640 --> 26:27.480]  It is a frustrating struggle, but it is a fun struggle.
[26:27.480 --> 26:29.320]  Perfection is all up to you.
[26:29.320 --> 26:30.320]  What is your goal?
[26:30.320 --> 26:31.480]  What are you trying to do?
[26:31.480 --> 26:36.360]  I know you're trying to get this plant to express itself to its fullest potential.
[26:36.360 --> 26:37.480]  You want the most turps.
[26:37.480 --> 26:38.920]  You want the most potency.
[26:38.920 --> 26:40.120]  You want the most colors.
[26:40.120 --> 26:41.800]  You want the most flavors and aromas.
[26:41.800 --> 26:42.960]  You want the best buzz.
[26:42.960 --> 26:44.880]  You want the best photography.
[26:44.880 --> 26:48.760]  And I admire that, but keep in mind that best is a very relative word.
[26:48.760 --> 26:52.720]  So my opinion of best, your opinion of best could be different.
[26:52.720 --> 26:55.440]  As long as you reach your goal, that is what matters.
[26:55.440 --> 26:59.360]  So my friend, you are going to have to mix up a bunch of batches of soil and I recommend
[26:59.360 --> 27:03.760]  running the same clone over and over in that soil.
[27:03.760 --> 27:08.280]  Take a lot of notes, get very familiar with the soil, get very familiar with that plant.
[27:08.280 --> 27:12.400]  Then once you have got that plant and that soil dialed in, that's when I would recommend
[27:12.400 --> 27:16.600]  putting some other clones in that mix and see how they react and see if that mix is
[27:16.600 --> 27:18.700]  perfect for those plants as well.
[27:18.700 --> 27:21.020]  Then see how you need to adjust that mix.
[27:21.020 --> 27:24.320]  Then we can start doing some science and find out the happy medium.
[27:24.320 --> 27:27.360]  Then maybe you can have the magic soil in the future.
[27:27.360 --> 27:32.700]  But honestly, I think it is going to be different soil for every plant and for every single
[27:32.700 --> 27:34.360]  phenotype.
[27:34.360 --> 27:38.400]  But don't feel alone, my friend, because you are on the quest that every advanced grower
[27:38.400 --> 27:39.480]  reaches.
[27:39.480 --> 27:44.240]  We want to find out how to make those plants express their truest potential.
[27:44.240 --> 27:46.820]  And I admire you for going down that path.
[27:46.820 --> 27:48.320]  It is a rabbit hole.
[27:48.320 --> 27:51.360]  Keep taking notes and don't let yourself become a mad scientist.
[27:51.360 --> 27:52.760]  I think you're on a great path.
[27:52.760 --> 27:54.280]  All right, there is more to this message.
[27:54.280 --> 27:58.880]  It says, another question, maybe you could dispel some of the myths surrounding long
[27:58.880 --> 28:00.920]  term storage of beans.
[28:00.920 --> 28:05.540]  I've always backpacked mine and kept them in an airtight waterproof case in the fridge.
[28:05.540 --> 28:11.120]  It seems to work, but I do notice older seeds become less viable, less vigorous in growth.
[28:11.120 --> 28:16.400]  Anyway, as a breeder, how would you store your beans for long periods of time?
[28:16.400 --> 28:17.520]  I really do like your podcast.
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.200]  I'd love to pop some of your beans someday when time allows.
[28:21.200 --> 28:22.920]  Thanks from Izer.
[28:23.520 --> 28:24.960]  Hey, this is a great message.
[28:24.960 --> 28:25.960]  Thank you.
[28:25.960 --> 28:29.320]  Let's talk briefly about seed storage.
[28:29.320 --> 28:35.200]  A big factor in how I decide to store my seeds is how long I intend to keep those seeds in
[28:35.200 --> 28:40.600]  storage and if I plan to remove them and show them to friends or anything like that.
[28:40.600 --> 28:45.080]  In most cases, I prefer to keep them in a cool, dry, dark environment.
[28:45.080 --> 28:47.320]  That is the main thing, cool, dry, and dark.
[28:47.320 --> 28:48.320]  We want them dark.
[28:48.320 --> 28:49.640]  We want them cool.
[28:49.640 --> 28:51.840]  Heat will kind of deactivate them and kill them.
[28:51.840 --> 28:52.840]  Heat is not good for anything.
[28:52.840 --> 28:54.400]  It degrades just about everything.
[28:54.400 --> 28:58.920]  Cool will kind of keep things in that suspended animation state, keep things alive.
[28:58.920 --> 29:01.160]  We keep things in preservation in a cooler.
[29:01.160 --> 29:05.280]  I don't recommend a freezer, although some people do do that.
[29:05.280 --> 29:08.200]  Dry, absolutely keep your seeds dry.
[29:08.200 --> 29:10.320]  Any moisture will cause them to germinate.
[29:10.320 --> 29:15.060]  So let's talk about storage and why I don't like to put some seeds in the refrigerator
[29:15.060 --> 29:17.520]  or in containers in the fridge.
[29:17.520 --> 29:23.600]  If you are going to remove your seeds from your cold storage frequently, I do not like
[29:23.600 --> 29:25.560]  to put them in the fridge.
[29:25.560 --> 29:29.400]  Just put them in the safe, put them on a shelf in the basement where it stays consistently
[29:29.400 --> 29:31.440]  cool and it never gets too hot.
[29:31.440 --> 29:35.040]  Something like that will be sufficient if you are the kind of person that wants to show
[29:35.040 --> 29:37.240]  your collection off to your friends.
[29:37.240 --> 29:43.520]  The reason I say this is every time you move your seeds from cold storage, you are changing
[29:43.520 --> 29:48.360]  the temperature of the seed, the packaging and the environment inside of that packaging.
[29:48.360 --> 29:54.520]  You do increase the risk and opportunity of some type of condensation or moisture making
[29:54.520 --> 29:56.400]  contact with your seeds.
[29:56.400 --> 29:59.280]  Why would we want to change the temperature once you've got them cool?
[29:59.280 --> 30:00.280]  They think they're stored.
[30:00.280 --> 30:01.280]  They think they're in the snow.
[30:01.280 --> 30:03.000]  They think they fell out of a plant.
[30:03.000 --> 30:04.000]  They're sitting in the snow.
[30:04.000 --> 30:05.920]  They're waiting for spring to come to germinate.
[30:05.920 --> 30:08.280]  Let's not take them out and keep teasing them.
[30:08.280 --> 30:10.560]  I also said I don't prefer to freeze seeds.
[30:10.560 --> 30:12.640]  I don't find that necessary.
[30:12.760 --> 30:15.240]  There are places that do freeze the seeds.
[30:15.240 --> 30:16.240]  I don't do it.
[30:16.240 --> 30:22.640]  I like to keep them in a sealed container that is airtight and I keep that in a brown
[30:22.640 --> 30:27.240]  paper bag in the bottom of a refrigerator in the crisper drawer if I intend to keep
[30:27.240 --> 30:29.560]  those seeds for a very long time.
[30:29.560 --> 30:32.800]  Now you said as a breeder, how do I store my seeds?
[30:32.800 --> 30:36.480]  Fortunately, my seeds do not stick around very long.
[30:36.480 --> 30:41.040]  So they are produced, they are packaged up and they basically go to vendors and they
[30:41.040 --> 30:42.040]  are gone.
[30:42.040 --> 30:46.720]  My personal seeds are kept in jars, which are kept sealed airtight, which are kept in
[30:46.720 --> 30:50.040]  a safe, which is in a very cool area of the house.
[30:50.040 --> 30:52.260]  It's in a basement in a very back corner.
[30:52.260 --> 30:54.600]  That section is always dark and cool back there.
[30:54.600 --> 30:59.200]  So I trust that those seeds will be safe, stored like that for quite a while.
[30:59.200 --> 31:04.000]  I've been able to germinate seeds that have been stored in that safe for five to 10 years
[31:04.000 --> 31:05.840]  and they come out very successfully.
[31:05.840 --> 31:11.740]  Yes, you are accurate in the idea that some seeds that get older will become less viable
[31:11.940 --> 31:13.220]  and less vigorous.
[31:13.220 --> 31:14.900]  That is just how nature goes.
[31:14.900 --> 31:17.460]  Over time, those things will start to degrade.
[31:17.460 --> 31:22.180]  But if you've got a large quantity, you should be able to germinate some out of those packs.
[31:22.180 --> 31:24.380]  Another thing is I don't vacuum seal mine.
[31:24.380 --> 31:26.020]  I just feel like that's unnecessary.
[31:26.020 --> 31:27.580]  I feel like it kind of crushes them.
[31:27.580 --> 31:29.900]  I just put them in a sealed container.
[31:29.900 --> 31:32.180]  I make sure that no moisture can get to them.
[31:32.180 --> 31:36.940]  And then I put them again in the back of the fridge in the dark or in that safe, which
[31:36.940 --> 31:40.600]  is in a cool, dark, dry location.
[31:40.600 --> 31:44.040]  I barely ever open that safe unless I need to get seeds out of there.
[31:44.040 --> 31:48.520]  I get what I need and I put them back and I don't handle the seeds more than necessary.
[31:48.520 --> 31:53.480]  I also recommend if you're going to handle the naked seed itself without packaging, wear
[31:53.480 --> 31:54.480]  gloves.
[31:54.480 --> 31:58.040]  You don't want to get your sweat, your skin oils and crap on the seeds, especially if
[31:58.040 --> 32:01.440]  those are going out for retail, please wear gloves.
[32:01.440 --> 32:06.280]  Now as a seed breeder, I do appreciate that people are buying seeds and storing them.
[32:06.280 --> 32:09.480]  But what I would really recommend is that you grow them.
[32:09.480 --> 32:13.240]  The best place for a seed is in some dirt.
[32:13.240 --> 32:14.560]  So get those seeds going.
[32:14.560 --> 32:17.520]  Hey, my new friend, Iser, I hope I covered your question.
[32:17.520 --> 32:20.360]  I'm pretty sure I went real deep on your soil question.
[32:20.360 --> 32:23.280]  I hope I covered your seed storage question.
[32:23.280 --> 32:25.840]  Basically keep them dry, dark and cool.
[32:25.840 --> 32:29.780]  Don't let any moisture get to them and your seeds should store for a very long time.
[32:29.780 --> 32:33.520]  If you do put them in the freezer or the refrigerator, leave them there.
[32:33.520 --> 32:35.280]  Quit bringing them out to show your friends.
[32:35.280 --> 32:39.640]  If you want to show your friends, just keep them in a safe, keep them in a dry, airtight,
[32:39.640 --> 32:42.400]  Tupperware container and I think you'll be okay.
[32:42.400 --> 32:45.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers
[32:45.840 --> 32:50.520]  and growers, cannabis activists and space cadets, I hope you guys enjoyed this long
