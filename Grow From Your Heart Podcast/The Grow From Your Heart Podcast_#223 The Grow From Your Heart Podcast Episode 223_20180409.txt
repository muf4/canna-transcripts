[00:15.740 --> 00:18.460]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:18.460 --> 00:20.340]  It's time for episode number 223
[00:20.340 --> 00:22.140]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:22.140 --> 00:25.900]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.900 --> 00:27.100]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:27.100 --> 00:28.420]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:28.420 --> 00:30.980]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.980 --> 00:32.380]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:32.380 --> 00:33.940]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.940 --> 00:35.900]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.900 --> 00:38.280]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.460 --> 00:41.460]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.460 --> 00:43.900]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.900 --> 00:46.100]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:46.100 --> 00:47.740]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.740 --> 00:50.300]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:50.300 --> 00:52.100]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot,
[00:52.100 --> 00:54.440]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.940 --> 00:57.540]  Happy 7-10, everybody.
[00:57.540 --> 00:58.740]  If you're listening to this episode
[00:58.740 --> 00:59.660]  on the day it comes out,
[00:59.660 --> 01:04.380]  you are listening on 7-10, which is July 10th, 2017.
[01:05.740 --> 01:07.860]  If you don't know what 7-10 is,
[01:07.860 --> 01:11.000]  it's a dabber holiday, it's a hash smoker holiday,
[01:11.040 --> 01:14.040]  and we'll talk a little more about it in just a few minutes.
[01:14.040 --> 01:15.580]  But before we get there,
[01:15.580 --> 01:16.800]  I wanna thank you guys for something,
[01:16.800 --> 01:18.480]  and then I wanna ask you for a little more.
[01:18.480 --> 01:19.400]  That's a good way to do it, right?
[01:19.400 --> 01:20.940]  Say thanks and then ask for more.
[01:20.940 --> 01:22.360]  On the last two episodes,
[01:22.360 --> 01:25.680]  I've been looking for suggestions for a new strain name.
[01:25.680 --> 01:27.760]  I bred Flo to Arise,
[01:27.760 --> 01:30.680]  and I've been asking the listeners to send me strain names.
[01:30.680 --> 01:33.160]  I've gotten a lot of great contributions.
[01:33.160 --> 01:34.200]  There've been some really good ones.
[01:34.200 --> 01:35.380]  I'm not gonna read any of them off
[01:35.380 --> 01:37.280]  because I don't wanna read some and not read some.
[01:37.280 --> 01:39.020]  It just feels like I'm leaving people out.
[01:39.020 --> 01:40.660]  But I feel like I've got a good idea
[01:41.320 --> 01:44.120]  of what that strain will be called when it's released.
[01:45.140 --> 01:46.820]  I'm not gonna release that here on the show,
[01:46.820 --> 01:48.060]  but I think I have a good idea.
[01:48.060 --> 01:48.900]  Now what I want from you,
[01:48.900 --> 01:50.820]  and thanks to everybody who has sent me
[01:50.820 --> 01:51.940]  great name suggestions,
[01:51.940 --> 01:54.080]  now what I'm asking for is suggestions
[01:54.080 --> 01:56.700]  for White Widow crossed to Arise.
[01:56.700 --> 01:58.520]  That's right, I took a White Widow girl
[01:58.520 --> 02:01.160]  and I crossed it to the Arise male.
[02:01.160 --> 02:04.020]  So any cool name suggestions would be appreciated.
[02:04.020 --> 02:06.380]  You can send those name suggestions to me
[02:06.380 --> 02:08.820]  at growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
[02:08.820 --> 02:12.180]  or you can tweet them to me at GFYHpodcast,
[02:12.180 --> 02:13.540]  or you can find me on Facebook
[02:13.540 --> 02:15.100]  under the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[02:15.100 --> 02:17.180]  or you can follow me on Instagram.
[02:17.180 --> 02:18.660]  My Instagram's a little different.
[02:18.660 --> 02:20.660]  It's irie underscore genetics.
[02:20.660 --> 02:23.040]  On Instagram, I use my other company name.
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.420]  It's Irie Genetics.
[02:24.420 --> 02:26.100]  That's where all the seeds are handled through.
[02:26.100 --> 02:28.300]  I post a lot of great pictures of my personal grows,
[02:28.300 --> 02:29.360]  my breeding projects.
[02:29.360 --> 02:31.500]  I post pictures of commercial grows.
[02:31.500 --> 02:35.540]  I try to post a picture of almost every grow I get to visit
[02:35.540 --> 02:36.740]  just because I like to share it with you guys.
[02:36.740 --> 02:37.900]  So check me out on Instagram.
[02:37.940 --> 02:39.100]  It's irie underscore genetics.
[02:39.100 --> 02:41.220]  And if you've got any recommendations
[02:41.220 --> 02:43.800]  for the name of White Widow to Arise,
[02:43.800 --> 02:47.060]  I would love to hear your recommendation.
[02:48.380 --> 02:50.160]  All right, what else do I have going on?
[02:50.160 --> 02:51.020]  Listener comments.
[02:51.020 --> 02:53.500]  Let's read some listener comments on iTunes.
[02:53.500 --> 02:55.020]  You guys, we haven't read the iTunes comments
[02:55.020 --> 02:55.980]  in a little while.
[02:55.980 --> 02:56.820]  It is July.
[02:56.820 --> 02:59.300]  There are a whole bunch of brand new comments.
[02:59.300 --> 03:00.540]  Let's get right into it.
[03:00.540 --> 03:01.980]  I'm gonna drop the music right out.
[03:01.980 --> 03:04.540]  We'll fade that out nice and slow.
[03:04.540 --> 03:06.460]  Let's get into the iTunes comments.
[03:06.460 --> 03:08.700]  This first iTunes comment comes from,
[03:08.700 --> 03:10.260]  it's actually an iTunes review.
[03:10.260 --> 03:11.540]  If you wanna leave an iTunes review,
[03:11.540 --> 03:12.940]  all you have to do is go to iTunes,
[03:12.940 --> 03:14.060]  go to the iTunes store,
[03:14.060 --> 03:16.060]  type in the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:16.060 --> 03:17.380]  A little icon with my face
[03:17.380 --> 03:19.620]  and a red, golden, green Rasta flag will pop up.
[03:19.620 --> 03:20.620]  Click on that.
[03:20.620 --> 03:23.100]  Right in the middle, it says ratings and reviews.
[03:23.100 --> 03:24.180]  Click on there.
[03:24.180 --> 03:27.200]  And then it shows you the spot to click on some stars.
[03:27.200 --> 03:28.440]  To rate, it says click to rate.
[03:28.440 --> 03:32.860]  So far, everybody, 62 people have given me a five-star rating.
[03:32.860 --> 03:35.180]  Click on as many stars as you feel I deserve.
[03:35.180 --> 03:36.620]  Then after that, type in a little review
[03:36.620 --> 03:38.180]  and let me know what you think of the show.
[03:38.180 --> 03:40.940]  And I'll read your comments on the podcast.
[03:40.940 --> 03:42.860]  Sometimes it takes me a few episodes to get to them.
[03:42.860 --> 03:45.300]  I like to let them build up, but I do read them.
[03:45.300 --> 03:46.880]  So let's get started reading them.
[03:46.880 --> 03:49.580]  This one comes from a person who calls themselves
[03:49.580 --> 03:51.360]  DoobieBrudda710.
[03:51.360 --> 03:53.820]  Perfect that I'm reading this on the 710 episode.
[03:53.820 --> 03:57.020]  They left this comment or this review on July 5th.
[03:57.020 --> 03:58.960]  So it was just left a couple of days ago.
[03:58.960 --> 04:01.100]  And it goes like this.
[04:01.100 --> 04:02.420]  While growing up in Wisconsin,
[04:02.420 --> 04:03.700]  we always had a lot of cheese
[04:03.700 --> 04:05.820]  and not the kind Rasta Jeff teaches us
[04:05.820 --> 04:07.580]  so graciously to grow.
[04:07.580 --> 04:11.580]  He's a very well-spoken podcaster who has a good voice
[04:11.580 --> 04:13.820]  and outstanding audio equipment.
[04:13.820 --> 04:16.080]  This is an extremely high quality podcast
[04:16.080 --> 04:18.460]  that not only supports great information,
[04:18.460 --> 04:20.680]  but also a super friendly vibe.
[04:20.680 --> 04:22.740]  My mom digs the hugs too.
[04:22.740 --> 04:23.740]  Awesome.
[04:23.740 --> 04:24.600]  That's a great comment, man.
[04:24.600 --> 04:27.180]  Thanks for the five-star review and the good comment.
[04:27.180 --> 04:29.420]  The dude says, I'm a very well-spoken podcaster
[04:29.420 --> 04:30.260]  with a good voice.
[04:30.260 --> 04:31.180]  Well, thank you.
[04:31.180 --> 04:32.460]  That was a gift, I guess.
[04:33.380 --> 04:35.460]  And outstanding audio equipment.
[04:35.460 --> 04:37.780]  Yes, I have got some tremendous gear.
[04:37.780 --> 04:39.980]  I've got several different ways to record.
[04:39.980 --> 04:43.100]  My main setup is a spaceship looking device over here.
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.840]  Some insight into that, I guess.
[04:45.840 --> 04:46.860]  I used to be a drummer.
[04:46.860 --> 04:47.700]  I'm still a drummer,
[04:47.700 --> 04:49.800]  but I used to be a traveling drummer and a recording drummer.
[04:49.800 --> 04:51.860]  My job was to play the damn drums.
[04:51.860 --> 04:55.620]  I am using a Mackie 1402 VLZ3 mixer
[04:55.620 --> 04:59.100]  that was purchased to be my drum mixer.
[04:59.100 --> 05:02.160]  This used to be, this was on stage for several shows.
[05:02.860 --> 05:03.840]  The drums would be plugged into this.
[05:03.840 --> 05:06.000]  The mics, I'd run mics to the drums
[05:06.000 --> 05:07.040]  and then plug those into this.
[05:07.040 --> 05:08.800]  You don't plug in drums, I know.
[05:08.800 --> 05:10.840]  The mic cords would run to this mixer.
[05:10.840 --> 05:13.080]  I would mix all the sound with this mixer right here,
[05:13.080 --> 05:14.540]  then run it to my in-ear monitors
[05:14.540 --> 05:16.240]  and then run that out to the house mix.
[05:16.240 --> 05:18.440]  And I would run all the other instruments into here
[05:18.440 --> 05:19.920]  and run them in my in-ear monitor
[05:19.920 --> 05:21.200]  so that I could hear them as I wanted.
[05:21.200 --> 05:22.880]  I can control my own monitor mix.
[05:22.880 --> 05:24.160]  I never had to deal with the sound guy
[05:24.160 --> 05:25.320]  blowing out my ears.
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.880]  It was much easier that way.
[05:27.880 --> 05:29.480]  But, so I've got the Mackie.
[05:29.480 --> 05:32.400]  The Mackie runs to a DBX compressor
[05:32.400 --> 05:35.680]  and then the DBX compressor runs to a Tascam,
[05:35.680 --> 05:38.720]  the US 1200 USB, which runs into the MacBook.
[05:38.720 --> 05:40.120]  So yes, there is some stuff going on
[05:40.120 --> 05:41.120]  to make it sound pretty good.
[05:41.120 --> 05:44.000]  We've got a pretty nice preamps in the Mackie
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.560]  and then the Tascam, I do,
[05:46.560 --> 05:48.320]  it's got preamps in it that sound pretty good.
[05:48.320 --> 05:50.680]  And then I turn up the gain just a little bit right there.
[05:50.680 --> 05:53.240]  And then I use the DBX to kind of just filter out
[05:53.240 --> 05:54.640]  all the noise and make it sound smooth.
[05:54.640 --> 05:56.400]  So thanks for the audio compliment.
[05:56.400 --> 05:57.240]  That's how I do it.
[05:57.240 --> 05:59.160]  A lot of people ask how I make the show sound so good.
[05:59.840 --> 06:04.080]  That's how, it's a Tascam, a USB 1200, a DBX compressor.
[06:04.080 --> 06:07.040]  I've also got a Livewire power conditioner in here
[06:07.040 --> 06:10.040]  just because that's part of my recording setup
[06:10.040 --> 06:12.200]  and my traveling tour setup and all that shit
[06:12.200 --> 06:13.040]  I'm used to seeing it.
[06:13.040 --> 06:15.120]  So I put it in here when I set this up
[06:15.120 --> 06:16.240]  and it gives me another spot.
[06:16.240 --> 06:18.480]  Honestly, I use that plug for the power conditioner.
[06:18.480 --> 06:20.160]  I plug in my iPhone right there, a whole bunch.
[06:20.160 --> 06:21.720]  So it's super damn convenient.
[06:21.720 --> 06:23.120]  Anyway, that's how the show sounds so good.
[06:23.120 --> 06:24.680]  Then I run it into GarageBand.
[06:24.680 --> 06:27.480]  It's just going into the old GarageBand, GarageBand 6.
[06:27.480 --> 06:28.640]  Nice and easy to edit.
[06:29.600 --> 06:31.280]  At the end, I don't do anything to it
[06:31.280 --> 06:32.560]  to make it sound better at the end.
[06:32.560 --> 06:33.760]  It doesn't get ran through anything.
[06:33.760 --> 06:36.120]  I could run it through Levelizer or something like that,
[06:36.120 --> 06:38.440]  but I don't, I just let it go just like it is and post it.
[06:38.440 --> 06:40.080]  So thanks for the comment on the audio sound.
[06:40.080 --> 06:42.880]  I appreciate that people notice how hard I try
[06:42.880 --> 06:45.160]  to make the audio sound good.
[06:45.160 --> 06:46.000]  Thank you, bro.
[06:46.000 --> 06:46.920]  And thanks for the five-star review.
[06:46.920 --> 06:49.040]  I said, bro, I'm gonna assume that since your name
[06:49.040 --> 06:51.160]  is DoobieBro out of 710, you're a bro.
[06:51.160 --> 06:52.400]  Either way, thanks, bro.
[06:52.400 --> 06:56.760]  And also they say that I've got great information
[06:56.760 --> 06:58.320]  and a super friendly vibe.
[06:58.320 --> 06:59.640]  Perfect, that's what I'm going for.
[06:59.640 --> 07:00.720]  I fucking nailed it.
[07:00.720 --> 07:02.360]  I like to give you good information
[07:02.360 --> 07:03.600]  and like to bring a friendly vibe.
[07:03.600 --> 07:05.880]  As a friendly, hippie type Rasta man,
[07:05.880 --> 07:08.400]  try to put a smile on your face and have one on my own.
[07:08.400 --> 07:09.880]  And then you say your mom digs the hugs,
[07:09.880 --> 07:11.040]  which is always fucking cool.
[07:11.040 --> 07:13.800]  So, hey, DoobieBrudda, take a fat dab
[07:13.800 --> 07:15.400]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[07:15.400 --> 07:18.680]  All right, let's move on to the next five-star review.
[07:18.680 --> 07:20.400]  This one was left on June 5th,
[07:20.400 --> 07:23.400]  so it's obviously been a minute since I've read comments.
[07:23.400 --> 07:24.960]  This comment was left by a listener
[07:24.960 --> 07:27.120]  who calls themselves B Cognetta.
[07:27.120 --> 07:27.960]  The headline of the comment is,
[07:27.960 --> 07:30.520]  hands down the best podcast.
[07:30.520 --> 07:31.360]  It goes like this,
[07:31.360 --> 07:32.920]  this show provides awesome grow advice
[07:32.920 --> 07:34.360]  and is highly entertaining.
[07:34.360 --> 07:38.440]  Would recommend to anyone interested in cannabis.
[07:38.440 --> 07:39.280]  Hey, thanks.
[07:39.280 --> 07:41.400]  My goal is to provide awesome grow advice
[07:41.400 --> 07:43.200]  and also entertain you.
[07:43.200 --> 07:45.480]  I'm kind of a jokester, sort of a dude.
[07:45.480 --> 07:46.560]  So I'm glad you're entertained.
[07:46.560 --> 07:47.800]  Also, it keeps your attention.
[07:47.800 --> 07:50.400]  I think you, I paid better attention in classes
[07:50.400 --> 07:52.640]  to teachers that gave a shit and connected
[07:52.640 --> 07:54.520]  and add to personality other than those teachers
[07:54.520 --> 07:56.840]  that are always like, turn to page 37
[07:57.560 --> 07:58.400]  and let's do the work.
[07:58.400 --> 07:59.960]  Not always bored the fuck out of me.
[07:59.960 --> 08:00.960]  And you're not gonna learn from that.
[08:00.960 --> 08:03.340]  You're gonna get bored and turn the page like I used to do.
[08:03.340 --> 08:04.920]  So try to be entertaining also.
[08:04.920 --> 08:05.840]  And then you say,
[08:05.840 --> 08:08.440]  would recommend to anyone interested in cannabis.
[08:08.440 --> 08:10.760]  Yes, please do recommend this podcast
[08:10.760 --> 08:13.720]  to everyone interested in cannabis.
[08:13.720 --> 08:16.240]  Even if people are just learning about cannabis,
[08:16.240 --> 08:17.920]  recommend my podcast to them.
[08:17.920 --> 08:19.680]  Just be like, hey, do you listen to this show?
[08:19.680 --> 08:22.920]  Anybody that just listens to podcasts in general,
[08:22.920 --> 08:24.880]  have them listen to my podcast, please.
[08:24.880 --> 08:26.200]  I would appreciate that.
[08:26.200 --> 08:29.480]  Awesome, B Cognetta, thank you for the iTunes comment
[08:29.480 --> 08:31.920]  and review and also thanks for the five star review.
[08:31.920 --> 08:33.520]  You know what, I'm gonna click,
[08:33.520 --> 08:35.480]  it says, was this review helpful?
[08:35.480 --> 08:37.520]  I'm gonna click yes on B Cognetta
[08:37.520 --> 08:39.960]  and I'm gonna click yes on DoobieBrudda710.
[08:39.960 --> 08:43.080]  Your comments were very helpful, thanks a lot.
[08:43.080 --> 08:45.720]  All right, let's move on to the next iTunes review
[08:45.720 --> 08:46.540]  and comment.
[08:46.540 --> 08:48.760]  This person left a five star rating
[08:48.760 --> 08:53.260]  and their name is, I'm guessing that's Colorado Jab.
[08:53.260 --> 08:54.960]  It's Colo Jab.
[08:54.960 --> 08:56.560]  They left their comment on June 1st
[08:56.560 --> 08:58.760]  and it goes like this, I'm loving this podcast.
[08:58.760 --> 09:01.540]  If you grow or are into cannabis,
[09:01.540 --> 09:04.920]  this one will educate and entertain.
[09:04.920 --> 09:07.360]  I see a theme here, you guys are entertained
[09:07.360 --> 09:09.840]  and you're getting educated and you love the show.
[09:09.840 --> 09:11.920]  That's fucking awesome, thank you.
[09:11.920 --> 09:14.440]  Thanks for loving the show, the show loves you back.
[09:14.440 --> 09:16.960]  Hey, thanks for letting me entertain and educate you
[09:16.960 --> 09:18.520]  for about an hour once a week
[09:18.520 --> 09:22.360]  and also thanks for the five star review, I appreciate that.
[09:22.360 --> 09:24.000]  Let's see, where is the next review?
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.400]  This one was left May 15th
[09:26.400 --> 09:28.560]  and it's left by a person who calls themselves
[09:28.560 --> 09:30.600]  John Funkytown Kingston.
[09:30.600 --> 09:32.320]  The headline is One Love.
[09:32.320 --> 09:34.680]  Of course, they left a five star rating
[09:34.680 --> 09:37.440]  and the comment goes like this, great podcast.
[09:37.440 --> 09:40.680]  I love finding new grow and cannabis related podcasts.
[09:40.680 --> 09:43.920]  Thanks so much for taking time to make this happen.
[09:43.920 --> 09:45.960]  Please check me out on Instagram.
[09:45.960 --> 09:47.600]  And then they give their Instagram handle
[09:47.600 --> 09:49.280]  and since you were smooth enough to sneak that in there,
[09:49.280 --> 09:50.720]  I think I may have read this comment before
[09:50.720 --> 09:52.880]  now that I see that or somebody else did this.
[09:53.040 --> 09:55.000]  But since you're smooth enough to sneak it in there,
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.840]  it's dakindcannabis, D-A-K-I-N-D cannabis.
[09:59.840 --> 10:01.840]  Check them out on Instagram, they just got a free plug.
[10:01.840 --> 10:03.380]  I'm gonna follow them.
[10:03.380 --> 10:04.760]  In his review, he also says,
[10:04.760 --> 10:07.080]  thanks for taking the time to make the podcast happen.
[10:07.080 --> 10:08.600]  Dude, you're very welcome.
[10:08.600 --> 10:12.200]  Thanks for taking the time to leave me a good review.
[10:12.200 --> 10:13.980]  I hope people check you out on Instagram.
[10:13.980 --> 10:15.840]  You better be clicking like on all my pics
[10:15.840 --> 10:17.280]  after this one, bro.
[10:17.280 --> 10:19.560]  All right, let's go to our next five star review.
[10:19.560 --> 10:21.360]  This is gonna be the last one for this episode.
[10:21.360 --> 10:23.040]  So if you're getting bored with the reviews,
[10:23.040 --> 10:23.960]  we are almost done.
[10:23.960 --> 10:25.160]  It goes like this.
[10:25.160 --> 10:26.440]  It was left on May 5th.
[10:26.440 --> 10:29.720]  It was left by somebody who calls themselves Live Lime.
[10:29.720 --> 10:31.640]  The headline is truly iry.
[10:31.640 --> 10:32.960]  The comment goes like this,
[10:32.960 --> 10:34.800]  polite, informed, and medicated.
[10:34.800 --> 10:37.260]  This show is a must listen whenever,
[10:37.260 --> 10:40.320]  whether you are in trim jail, driving, or in a cubicle.
[10:40.320 --> 10:42.220]  Thanks, Ross DeJeff, for the knowledge.
[10:42.220 --> 10:44.080]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[10:44.080 --> 10:46.800]  So this dude says I'm polite and I'm informed
[10:46.800 --> 10:47.860]  and I'm medicated.
[10:47.860 --> 10:49.760]  Those are all things I would agree with.
[10:49.760 --> 10:50.680]  I try to be polite.
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.320]  I could be a dickhead sometimes
[10:52.320 --> 10:55.480]  and my comedian mouth and mind gets ahead of me,
[10:55.480 --> 10:56.420]  but I try to be polite.
[10:56.420 --> 10:57.800]  So thanks for that compliment.
[10:57.800 --> 10:59.360]  Informed, yes, I am informed.
[10:59.360 --> 11:02.140]  I try to stay informed and educated with cannabis.
[11:02.140 --> 11:04.300]  And medicated, I am highly medicated.
[11:04.300 --> 11:06.960]  It's the 710 episode, so I'm certainly medicated.
[11:06.960 --> 11:08.960]  We'll talk about that in a minute.
[11:08.960 --> 11:09.980]  This show's a must listen.
[11:09.980 --> 11:11.080]  Yes, you must listen.
[11:11.080 --> 11:13.640]  Please, you must also tell your friends to listen.
[11:13.640 --> 11:15.660]  And then you say whether you're in trim jail,
[11:15.660 --> 11:17.800]  which you guys, if you've never been to trim jail,
[11:17.800 --> 11:18.800]  that means when you're trimming
[11:18.800 --> 11:20.400]  and you've just been trimming and trimming
[11:20.840 --> 11:23.400]  for hours, we've got people that we pay to trim
[11:23.400 --> 11:25.520]  and they trim for eight hours a day.
[11:25.520 --> 11:26.680]  And that looks like jail.
[11:26.680 --> 11:29.200]  So if you're in trim jail or if you're driving,
[11:29.200 --> 11:31.560]  driving is where I listen to most of my podcasts.
[11:31.560 --> 11:35.480]  Or if you're in a cubicle, this is the show to listen to.
[11:35.480 --> 11:39.200]  And the dude says thanks, Rasta Jeff, for the knowledge.
[11:39.200 --> 11:41.200]  You're very welcome for sharing the knowledge.
[11:41.200 --> 11:43.800]  I don't feel like it would be safe to learn this much
[11:43.800 --> 11:45.600]  and not spread it somehow.
[11:45.600 --> 11:46.560]  That's like my return.
[11:46.560 --> 11:47.920]  I've been given a couple of gifts
[11:47.920 --> 11:49.700]  and I like to put them back out there.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.140]  So you're very welcome.
[11:51.140 --> 11:52.480]  And thanks for the cool compliment.
[11:52.480 --> 11:54.240]  Thanks for appreciating the show.
[11:54.240 --> 11:55.080]  And thanks for doing it.
[11:55.080 --> 11:56.900]  It looks like you're in trim jail quite often.
[11:56.900 --> 11:59.220]  So thanks for doing what you do for cannabis.
[11:59.220 --> 12:00.720]  And I'll give my mom a hug for you.
[12:00.720 --> 12:01.860]  She'll think it's weird when I'm like,
[12:01.860 --> 12:03.460]  hey, LiveLime said give you a hug.
[12:03.460 --> 12:04.740]  She'll be like, what the fuck is that about?
[12:04.740 --> 12:05.900]  But I'll do it, bro.
[12:05.900 --> 12:07.340]  It'll be awkward for everybody.
[12:07.340 --> 12:09.060]  And I like awkward.
[12:09.900 --> 12:11.180]  All right, everybody, I wanna thank you guys
[12:11.180 --> 12:12.860]  for leaving iTunes reviews.
[12:12.860 --> 12:14.460]  Once again, if you wanna leave an iTunes review,
[12:14.460 --> 12:16.500]  simply go to iTunes, find the iTunes store,
[12:16.500 --> 12:17.880]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[12:17.880 --> 12:19.960]  Right in the middle, it says ratings and reviews.
[12:19.960 --> 12:20.800]  Click on there.
[12:20.800 --> 12:22.120]  I bet you can figure out the rest from there.
[12:22.120 --> 12:24.840]  So far, everybody has given me a five-star review.
[12:24.840 --> 12:28.960]  There's 62 five-star reviews up here.
[12:28.960 --> 12:30.520]  All right, you guys, let's move forward
[12:30.520 --> 12:31.360]  with the show a little bit.
[12:31.360 --> 12:33.080]  At the top of the show, I told you
[12:33.080 --> 12:35.960]  that I was going to talk a little bit about 7-10
[12:35.960 --> 12:38.580]  and the meaning and of course the origin
[12:38.580 --> 12:40.320]  of the phrase 7-10.
[12:40.320 --> 12:41.840]  If you don't know what 7-10 is,
[12:41.840 --> 12:44.280]  7-10 is the dab smoker holiday.
[12:44.280 --> 12:47.440]  7-10 is when you're supposed to smoke hash.
[12:47.960 --> 12:49.920]  7-10 is the new 420.
[12:49.920 --> 12:52.480]  That's a phrase coined by my friend Adam Mill.
[12:52.480 --> 12:56.880]  He always says 7-10 is the new 420 and I agree with him.
[12:56.880 --> 12:58.880]  So what is 7-10 all about?
[12:58.880 --> 13:00.960]  I'll take a few seconds here and explain it to you.
[13:00.960 --> 13:04.600]  Obviously, if you turn the number 7-10 upside down,
[13:04.600 --> 13:05.960]  it says oil.
[13:05.960 --> 13:10.160]  So 7-10 became the time to smoke oil.
[13:10.160 --> 13:11.740]  That's fairly obvious.
[13:11.740 --> 13:14.880]  So everybody was smoking weed at 420
[13:14.880 --> 13:17.120]  and then all the big hash craze came along
[13:17.800 --> 13:18.760]  and everyone started taking dabs
[13:18.760 --> 13:20.480]  and so somebody, and we'll talk about who
[13:20.480 --> 13:21.520]  in just a couple of seconds,
[13:21.520 --> 13:23.680]  somebody decided that 7-10,
[13:23.680 --> 13:26.320]  since it was oil upside down, 7-10 in the evening
[13:26.320 --> 13:28.880]  or if you're like me, 7-10 in the morning
[13:28.880 --> 13:30.840]  or both if you're like me, I guess,
[13:30.840 --> 13:33.000]  was the best time to smoke some dabs.
[13:33.900 --> 13:38.120]  So 7-10 upside down or oil upside down is 7-10.
[13:38.120 --> 13:40.540]  That's pretty much where it originated.
[13:41.520 --> 13:43.920]  Now one thing I can tell you is that 7-10
[13:43.920 --> 13:47.480]  is not the temperature of your e-mail.
[13:47.480 --> 13:50.040]  A lot of people said 7-10 is the perfect temp
[13:50.040 --> 13:50.880]  for your e-mail.
[13:50.880 --> 13:53.760]  It may be for your e-mail, but it is not for all e-mails
[13:53.760 --> 13:55.920]  and I'm gonna rant for a second on why.
[13:55.920 --> 13:57.000]  Think about this.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.800]  You've got an e-mail with a box with a number on it
[13:59.800 --> 14:02.900]  that is sending something down a cable to a coil
[14:02.900 --> 14:06.220]  that is attached to a nail that has got to heat up.
[14:06.220 --> 14:08.480]  Now your box that has a number on it
[14:08.480 --> 14:10.520]  doesn't know if you just put that coil
[14:10.520 --> 14:12.480]  on a quartz nail, on a titanium nail,
[14:12.480 --> 14:14.120]  or if you wrapped it around your finger.
[14:14.120 --> 14:17.320]  All it knows is that that coil needs to heat up
[14:17.320 --> 14:20.120]  to about a certain temperature range.
[14:20.120 --> 14:22.800]  There is not, in most e-mails that I am aware of,
[14:22.800 --> 14:25.120]  there is not a thermostat in that coil.
[14:25.120 --> 14:28.460]  It is sending a frequency, an amount of electricity
[14:28.460 --> 14:31.180]  through that coil and that much power at the end of it
[14:31.180 --> 14:32.640]  is causing that much heat.
[14:32.640 --> 14:35.800]  It is not, it's not like a range on your stereo.
[14:35.800 --> 14:37.360]  It's not a specific measurement.
[14:37.360 --> 14:40.000]  It's just like, you know that when your car,
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.640]  when you turn the car's stereo up to 23, it sounds good.
[14:42.640 --> 14:45.200]  If you go up to like 29, it starts to crackle a little bit.
[14:45.200 --> 14:47.660]  When you hit 32, it sounds like total shit.
[14:47.660 --> 14:51.740]  So each e-mail will have its own adjusting range
[14:51.740 --> 14:54.400]  where it will be perfect and not all of them
[14:54.400 --> 14:56.200]  will dial in at 710.
[14:56.200 --> 14:58.800]  My e-mail that I use from Giddyup and the Gnail,
[14:58.800 --> 15:00.560]  depending on which nail I put on it,
[15:00.560 --> 15:04.200]  I need to adjust it anywhere from around 600 to 800.
[15:04.200 --> 15:08.580]  If I use the highly educated, the, which one is that?
[15:08.580 --> 15:09.580]  It's the H-Nail.
[15:09.580 --> 15:11.920]  It's just the old school e-mail insert.
[15:11.920 --> 15:15.520]  If I use that one, that one, I need to put it down
[15:15.520 --> 15:16.860]  in the like 650s.
[15:16.860 --> 15:18.740]  If I use the new one with the quartz dish
[15:18.740 --> 15:20.500]  and that big titanium shroud,
[15:20.500 --> 15:23.140]  I have to crank that fucker up closer to 800
[15:23.140 --> 15:27.420]  because all the extra stuff, the nail head is much bigger.
[15:27.420 --> 15:31.020]  So your box, your e-mail box does not know the surface
[15:31.020 --> 15:33.740]  on the, the temperature on the surface of the nail.
[15:33.740 --> 15:34.760]  So that is not true.
[15:34.760 --> 15:37.420]  A lot of people think that 710 is the,
[15:37.820 --> 15:39.260]  temperature on the surface of the nail.
[15:39.260 --> 15:40.100]  That's inaccurate.
[15:40.100 --> 15:42.300]  Sorry, I stuttered so many times trying to say that.
[15:42.300 --> 15:44.100]  I think I got my point across.
[15:44.100 --> 15:46.860]  So that is not what 710 means.
[15:46.860 --> 15:48.980]  What 710 means is oil upside down
[15:48.980 --> 15:50.780]  and it's time to take a dab.
[15:50.780 --> 15:53.940]  Now let's talk a little bit how it originated.
[15:53.940 --> 15:55.260]  I want to give a shout out to somebody
[15:55.260 --> 15:58.380]  I feel is highly responsible for many advances
[15:58.380 --> 16:01.700]  in our current hash culture and the 710 movement
[16:01.700 --> 16:05.000]  and dab culture and our ability to smoke dabs.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.700]  A true innovator.
[16:06.700 --> 16:08.100]  He's a musical artist.
[16:08.100 --> 16:10.020]  He makes titanium nails.
[16:10.020 --> 16:12.220]  He now makes quartz nails.
[16:12.220 --> 16:14.180]  He was the originator of the e-nail.
[16:14.180 --> 16:16.860]  Of course, I owe a huge shout out to Task Rock
[16:16.860 --> 16:18.980]  of highly educated titanium.
[16:18.980 --> 16:21.000]  Big shout out, much respect.
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.700]  To the best of my knowledge,
[16:22.700 --> 16:25.780]  Task Rock and the guy from Health Stone Glass
[16:25.780 --> 16:29.340]  and the guy from BHO Clothing came up with the idea
[16:29.340 --> 16:32.580]  for 710 and Task Rock is the person
[16:32.580 --> 16:34.940]  who coined the phrase 710.
[16:34.940 --> 16:36.460]  So big shout out to Task.
[16:37.220 --> 16:39.140]  Happy 710 to everybody in the dab community.
[16:39.140 --> 16:41.620]  Everybody take a big fat dab right now
[16:41.620 --> 16:43.740]  and give some praise to Task.
[16:43.740 --> 16:45.300]  I'm actually gonna grab a dabber right now
[16:45.300 --> 16:46.820]  and I'm going to heat myself up a dab
[16:46.820 --> 16:48.140]  and take a dab with you guys on the show.
[16:48.140 --> 16:49.660]  I usually don't dab on the show.
[16:49.660 --> 16:51.700]  I usually do it during a break or something
[16:51.700 --> 16:52.820]  because I've been coughing a lot.
[16:52.820 --> 16:54.500]  Sometimes I get super rambly.
[16:54.500 --> 16:55.340]  Just don't do it on the show.
[16:55.340 --> 16:56.180]  Try to get my shit together.
[16:56.180 --> 16:57.000]  But you know what?
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.740]  It's 710 and we're gonna dab for Task Rock.
[16:58.740 --> 17:00.020]  Let's all dab together.
[17:00.020 --> 17:02.620]  Right now I am dabbing some.
[17:02.620 --> 17:03.740]  I've been calling it Lemon P.
[17:03.740 --> 17:06.580]  It's Lemon Skunk and Prodagium Shatter.
[17:06.580 --> 17:08.020]  And then I've got some of this
[17:09.340 --> 17:12.760]  this Lemon Jeffery High Terpene Full Spectrum Extract.
[17:13.660 --> 17:14.940]  I dunk the dab into here.
[17:14.940 --> 17:16.240]  Give it a little swirl.
[17:17.300 --> 17:18.500]  The next time we'll smoke some of this
[17:18.500 --> 17:21.220]  Lemon Jeffery High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum Extract
[17:21.220 --> 17:22.940]  with a High Terp dumped into it.
[17:22.940 --> 17:25.620]  But right now let's get down on this one.
[17:25.620 --> 17:27.060]  I'm gonna heat the nail here.
[17:27.060 --> 17:29.380]  I'm hitting the Hitman.
[17:29.380 --> 17:32.380]  The little hammerhead perk with the yellow logo on it.
[17:32.380 --> 17:34.340]  And then I've got the highly educated nail
[17:34.340 --> 17:38.680]  that's got the titanium base with the screw on quartz dish.
[17:38.680 --> 17:40.420]  So let's go and heat up a fat dab
[17:40.420 --> 17:41.780]  or heat up the nail for myself.
[17:41.780 --> 17:43.100]  Take a fat dab.
[17:43.100 --> 17:45.660]  Of course I'm using this super dope
[17:45.660 --> 17:48.980]  coil condenser decorated torch to heat up the nail.
[17:48.980 --> 17:50.980]  I apologize if you hear that ridiculous noise
[17:50.980 --> 17:52.100]  from the torch in the background.
[17:52.100 --> 17:53.580]  Just going.
[17:53.580 --> 17:55.820]  But sometimes it's what you gotta do for a fat dab.
[17:55.820 --> 17:56.660]  It's heating up.
[17:57.660 --> 17:59.100]  Gonna heat it till it glows.
[17:59.100 --> 17:59.940]  And you know what?
[17:59.940 --> 18:02.180]  We're gonna do two things here in honor of Mickey Martin.
[18:02.980 --> 18:04.180]  I'm gonna hit this fucker while it's glowing red.
[18:04.180 --> 18:06.700]  Shout out to Mickey Martin, hashtag glow squad.
[18:06.700 --> 18:07.780]  Huge shout out to TaskRock.
[18:07.780 --> 18:08.620]  Let's do this.
[18:08.620 --> 18:09.460]  Dab with me you guys.
[18:20.520 --> 18:21.580]  Oh God, that's hot.
[18:21.580 --> 18:22.760]  I hit it way too hot.
[18:26.320 --> 18:27.680]  Oh man.
[18:27.680 --> 18:28.760]  Red means go.
[18:28.760 --> 18:29.800]  Hit it when it's real hot.
[18:29.800 --> 18:31.040]  See what it does to you.
[18:31.040 --> 18:31.880]  No, don't do it.
[18:31.880 --> 18:33.560]  It's better if you let it cool.
[18:33.560 --> 18:35.980]  The terps taste better if you let it cool.
[18:35.980 --> 18:37.380]  But I feel like I get something different
[18:37.380 --> 18:39.020]  when I go in super hot like that.
[18:40.200 --> 18:41.160]  See what I was talking about?
[18:41.160 --> 18:43.000]  I don't dab on the show because it makes me ramble
[18:43.040 --> 18:45.320]  and it makes me all dumb for a second.
[18:45.320 --> 18:46.660]  Happy 7-10 everybody.
[18:47.720 --> 18:48.560]  Ooh, that was too hot.
[18:48.560 --> 18:49.400]  I like it.
[18:49.400 --> 18:51.080]  Ooh, my body's dying.
[18:51.080 --> 18:52.200]  I'm gonna take a drink.
[18:52.200 --> 18:54.400]  That one was for Mickey Martin and TaskRock.
[18:58.810 --> 19:00.890]  Okay, I'm back on my game.
[19:00.890 --> 19:03.250]  All right, which direction do we wanna go?
[19:03.250 --> 19:05.150]  Oh shit, let's do something important.
[19:07.090 --> 19:09.010]  I came across this just a couple of days ago,
[19:09.010 --> 19:10.450]  ladies and gentlemen.
[19:10.450 --> 19:13.450]  A lot of us use pesticides in our garden.
[19:13.450 --> 19:16.450]  If you work in Colorado, Washington, or Oregon,
[19:16.450 --> 19:19.290]  or any of the states that have regulated,
[19:19.290 --> 19:22.890]  legalized cannabis grows, there are lists of pesticides
[19:22.890 --> 19:25.050]  that you are and are not allowed to use.
[19:25.930 --> 19:28.250]  Now, those pesticides have been approved
[19:28.250 --> 19:30.730]  or disapproved for multiple reasons.
[19:30.730 --> 19:32.650]  Mainly, anything approved for tobacco
[19:32.650 --> 19:34.610]  has been approved for use on cannabis.
[19:35.890 --> 19:39.250]  Amongst the things that have been approved
[19:39.250 --> 19:42.450]  for cannabis is Azotrol.
[19:42.450 --> 19:45.690]  You are allowed to use Azotrol in a recreational grow
[19:45.690 --> 19:47.630]  if used appropriately.
[19:49.250 --> 19:50.850]  Excuse me, I'm trying to cough off that dab
[19:50.850 --> 19:53.250]  without coughing into the mic too much.
[19:53.250 --> 19:56.570]  Okay, so Azotrol, we trust in Azotrol.
[19:56.570 --> 19:59.950]  We trust in the Department of Ag to do their inspections.
[19:59.950 --> 20:02.250]  We trust in these companies to put things in the bottle
[20:02.250 --> 20:03.810]  that they say is in the bottle.
[20:05.010 --> 20:08.890]  On June 28th, the Oregon Department of Agriculture
[20:08.890 --> 20:11.130]  released the following statement.
[20:12.050 --> 20:16.130]  Pesticide advisory, misbranded slash adulterated
[20:16.130 --> 20:18.850]  pesticide products, presence of several
[20:18.850 --> 20:21.690]  undeclared pesticide residues.
[20:21.690 --> 20:23.170]  So what this is already hinting at
[20:23.170 --> 20:24.750]  is that there is shit in the bottle
[20:24.750 --> 20:26.690]  that nobody told us about.
[20:26.690 --> 20:29.150]  I'll go ahead and read the rest of the notice.
[20:30.050 --> 20:31.690]  The Oregon Department of Agriculture
[20:31.690 --> 20:34.010]  has ordered stoppage of sale and distribution
[20:34.010 --> 20:36.450]  of two pesticide products manufactured
[20:36.450 --> 20:39.290]  by PBI Gordon Corporation after finding the presence
[20:39.330 --> 20:41.490]  of several pesticide active ingredients
[20:41.490 --> 20:44.130]  not listed on the product label.
[20:44.130 --> 20:46.330]  Azotrol hydro botanical insecticide
[20:46.330 --> 20:49.130]  and Azotrol EC insecticide are labeled
[20:49.130 --> 20:51.650]  for use on ornamental food and feed crops
[20:51.650 --> 20:55.330]  as an insecticide, insect growth regulator, and repellent.
[20:55.330 --> 20:56.930]  These products may also be used
[20:56.930 --> 20:58.450]  in the production of cannabis.
[20:59.450 --> 21:02.810]  Both products list the active ingredient Azodirachtin
[21:02.810 --> 21:05.250]  derived from neem seeds and may be identified
[21:05.770 --> 21:10.450]  by the EPA registration number 2217-836.
[21:10.450 --> 21:12.330]  The products are listed for organic use
[21:12.330 --> 21:14.410]  by the Organic Materials Review Institute,
[21:14.410 --> 21:15.970]  also known as OMRI.
[21:15.970 --> 21:18.450]  In addition, the Oregon Department of Agriculture
[21:18.450 --> 21:20.250]  is asking growers who may have purchased
[21:20.250 --> 21:24.490]  the pesticide product to refrain from using it.
[21:24.490 --> 21:26.290]  Oregon Department of Agriculture's actions
[21:26.290 --> 21:28.510]  came following an investigation of the product
[21:28.510 --> 21:31.310]  and laboratory analysis found the presence
[21:31.310 --> 21:33.530]  of the pesticide active ingredients,
[21:33.530 --> 21:36.170]  and there's a bunch of words in here I may fuck up,
[21:36.170 --> 21:40.250]  but they found Permethrin, Bephenthrin,
[21:40.250 --> 21:45.250]  Cypermethrin, Cyflathrin, and Chlorpyrifos.
[21:48.810 --> 21:50.450]  I'm gonna try you guys, I'm gonna sound this out
[21:50.450 --> 21:51.770]  like I did in school.
[21:51.770 --> 21:56.210]  Chlorpyrifos, Chlorpyrifos, Chlorpyrifos,
[21:56.210 --> 21:58.050]  that's what we're gonna say, it sounds like a Greek god.
[21:58.050 --> 21:59.450]  They found Chlorpyrifos in there,
[21:59.450 --> 22:01.690]  I don't know what that is to tell you the honest truth,
[22:01.690 --> 22:05.090]  but none of which were listed on either product label.
[22:05.090 --> 22:07.650]  So we are trusting these companies
[22:07.650 --> 22:10.910]  to make a product and package a product
[22:10.910 --> 22:14.130]  and print a label on the product and be honest with us
[22:14.130 --> 22:16.090]  and tell us what they are selling us.
[22:16.090 --> 22:18.370]  We rely on them for that because we then take
[22:18.370 --> 22:19.770]  these products that are approved
[22:19.770 --> 22:21.570]  by the Department of Agriculture
[22:21.570 --> 22:23.970]  and we apply them to our plants.
[22:23.970 --> 22:27.070]  Then they are tested because they are tested
[22:27.070 --> 22:30.890]  by the MED and private labs test these plants
[22:31.770 --> 22:33.210]  so if I work in a commercial grow,
[22:33.210 --> 22:34.610]  I'm sure you guys know that by now.
[22:34.610 --> 22:39.170]  I am the cultivation manager for Three Rivers Dispensary,
[22:39.170 --> 22:40.670]  Three Rivers Development.
[22:43.050 --> 22:46.070]  I apply pesticides to plants
[22:46.070 --> 22:48.370]  with worker protection safety training.
[22:48.370 --> 22:51.330]  I am pesticide safety trained, I understand what I'm doing.
[22:51.330 --> 22:53.750]  I understand when and how to apply a pesticide.
[22:55.450 --> 22:57.670]  I apply these pesticides to my crops.
[22:57.670 --> 23:01.270]  Before I am allowed to pass these crops
[23:01.270 --> 23:04.070]  from my grow to the retail end,
[23:04.070 --> 23:07.750]  they must be tested by a laboratory for pesticide residuals,
[23:07.750 --> 23:10.470]  for mold residuals, for contaminants.
[23:10.470 --> 23:12.750]  They test for so much shit.
[23:12.750 --> 23:15.990]  Now, they are going to find, because this company lied,
[23:15.990 --> 23:18.710]  they are going to find things that I can't pronounce
[23:18.710 --> 23:20.410]  that are not allowed to be in there
[23:20.410 --> 23:22.570]  because this company put them in the bottle
[23:22.570 --> 23:24.270]  and did not say that it was there.
[23:25.230 --> 23:27.070]  So now there are going to be crops
[23:27.470 --> 23:29.030]  that will have to be destroyed
[23:29.030 --> 23:31.950]  and there will be businesses that don't make money.
[23:31.950 --> 23:34.270]  There will be patients that don't get medicine.
[23:34.270 --> 23:36.590]  This is going to just fuck up a lot of,
[23:36.590 --> 23:37.590]  it's going to snowball.
[23:37.590 --> 23:39.230]  This isn't just one small thing.
[23:39.230 --> 23:41.630]  This company, the company that made the pesticide
[23:41.630 --> 23:43.870]  isn't going to be the only one to get fucked.
[23:43.870 --> 23:46.550]  And honestly, the patients that consumed
[23:46.550 --> 23:48.510]  any of the medicine that was sprayed with this
[23:48.510 --> 23:51.350]  by the people that did not know it was in there,
[23:51.350 --> 23:53.710]  they're really the ones getting fucked.
[23:53.710 --> 23:56.050]  So there's more to this pesticide advisory newsletter
[23:56.050 --> 23:58.410]  that went out and I'll continue to read it.
[23:58.410 --> 24:00.170]  I think I stopped right about here.
[24:00.170 --> 24:01.930]  In an abundance of caution,
[24:01.930 --> 24:05.390]  a statewide stop sale, use or removal order
[24:05.390 --> 24:07.810]  has been issued by the Oregon Department of Agriculture
[24:07.810 --> 24:10.810]  to PBI Gordon Corporation of Kansas City.
[24:10.810 --> 24:13.370]  The order calls for the company to immediately cease
[24:13.370 --> 24:16.150]  all sales, offers of sale, or other distribution
[24:16.150 --> 24:17.570]  of the product in Oregon.
[24:17.570 --> 24:20.050]  So they can no longer sell this product in Oregon.
[24:20.050 --> 24:23.370]  I honestly think it's been banned in the Colorado MED use
[24:23.370 --> 24:24.810]  for quite a while anyway.
[24:24.810 --> 24:26.850]  I haven't seen Azitrol in a grow.
[24:26.850 --> 24:29.410]  I haven't used Azitrol on a grow in quite a while.
[24:29.410 --> 24:32.890]  I think Azomax and Evergreen have been the two go-tos lately.
[24:32.890 --> 24:34.230]  There are a few other things.
[24:34.230 --> 24:36.730]  I should tell you guys about a product called Grandivo.
[24:36.730 --> 24:40.450]  Check out Grandivo water dispersed granules.
[24:40.450 --> 24:43.870]  It looks expensive, but once you read about how to use it,
[24:43.870 --> 24:46.370]  it is very cost effective and it's worth it.
[24:46.370 --> 24:48.350]  It is a multi-purpose product.
[24:48.350 --> 24:51.370]  It will help you get rid of powdery mildew.
[24:51.370 --> 24:53.390]  It'll help you get rid of most of your bugs.
[24:53.390 --> 24:54.770]  You can use it as a soil drench.
[24:55.610 --> 24:57.370]  It will not affect your roots at all.
[24:57.370 --> 24:59.370]  You can use it as a foliar feed.
[24:59.370 --> 25:01.930]  It has so many applications.
[25:01.930 --> 25:04.890]  Grandivo WDG, check that shit out.
[25:04.890 --> 25:06.570]  Just a little tip for you.
[25:06.570 --> 25:07.730]  Then I'm gonna go on with this letter.
[25:07.730 --> 25:10.290]  It also says retailers and the general public
[25:10.290 --> 25:12.710]  in possession of Azitrol products manufactured
[25:12.710 --> 25:15.970]  by PBR Gordon Corporation are advised not to sell,
[25:15.970 --> 25:18.010]  offer for sale, or distribute them.
[25:18.010 --> 25:21.050]  ODA will be working with the manufacturer
[25:21.050 --> 25:23.790]  to determine the appropriate disposition of product
[25:23.830 --> 25:26.470]  that is currently in commerce or with growers.
[25:26.470 --> 25:29.190]  ODA's investigation will proceed to address violations
[25:29.190 --> 25:31.690]  of Oregon's pesticide law, which include misbranding
[25:31.690 --> 25:35.410]  of a pesticide product, adulteration of a pesticide product,
[25:35.410 --> 25:37.430]  and making false or misleading claims
[25:37.430 --> 25:39.910]  about a pesticide product.
[25:39.910 --> 25:42.130]  For additional information, and there is a number
[25:42.130 --> 25:43.990]  to contact the Oregon Department of Agriculture.
[25:43.990 --> 25:45.950]  I'm not gonna give out their phone number here
[25:45.950 --> 25:46.790]  on my podcast.
[25:46.790 --> 25:49.230]  That may result in trolling and we don't need that.
[25:49.230 --> 25:52.790]  But, ladies and gentlemen, if you're using Azitrol
[25:52.790 --> 25:54.470]  because you think it is semi-safe,
[25:54.470 --> 25:57.390]  and it's much more gentle than a lot of products
[25:57.390 --> 25:58.990]  that are out there, I would recommend Azitrol
[25:58.990 --> 26:00.590]  before a lot of things.
[26:00.590 --> 26:03.110]  If you're using Azitrol, you may want to reconsider.
[26:03.110 --> 26:04.910]  If you've got a whole bunch of it,
[26:04.910 --> 26:06.990]  you might not wanna use it for a little while
[26:06.990 --> 26:09.610]  until they get this figured out and find out
[26:09.610 --> 26:12.230]  which batches were adulterated.
[26:12.230 --> 26:13.610]  I know pesticides are expensive,
[26:13.610 --> 26:14.870]  and if you've bought a bunch of this stuff
[26:14.870 --> 26:16.650]  for your commercial grower or whatever,
[26:16.650 --> 26:19.350]  it's gonna be hard to set that money aside
[26:19.350 --> 26:22.350]  and buy another product, but you've got some thinking to do.
[26:22.430 --> 26:24.390]  If you're in Oregon, you can't use it at all.
[26:24.390 --> 26:26.910]  If you're in Colorado, I don't think you're able to use it.
[26:26.910 --> 26:30.110]  If you're using Azitrol and you can't replace it,
[26:30.110 --> 26:33.550]  just run out soon, and when you do run out, buy Azimax.
[26:33.550 --> 26:34.990]  And just don't buy any more Azitrol.
[26:34.990 --> 26:37.350]  No matter what state you're in, I wouldn't risk it
[26:37.350 --> 26:39.350]  because you're thinking you're getting one thing
[26:39.350 --> 26:41.310]  and they're selling you another.
[26:41.310 --> 26:42.150]  Don't risk it.
[26:42.150 --> 26:45.710]  Just go get Azimax or Evergreen, or get them both
[26:45.710 --> 26:47.790]  and switch between Azimax and Evergreen,
[26:47.790 --> 26:50.150]  and that'll really solve your problem anyway.
[26:50.150 --> 26:52.330]  It's always a good idea to switch up pesticides anyway
[26:53.310 --> 26:54.590]  because your bugs will start building a resistance.
[26:54.590 --> 26:56.650]  So if you hit them one day with Azimax
[26:56.650 --> 26:58.330]  and then you hit them the next time with Evergreen
[26:58.330 --> 27:00.110]  and then you hit them with Azimax the next time,
[27:00.110 --> 27:01.610]  they're not gonna know what to adjust to.
[27:01.610 --> 27:03.970]  So you're just gonna hit them with multiple modes.
[27:03.970 --> 27:06.050]  They'll get the least resistance,
[27:06.050 --> 27:07.850]  and then your pesticides will continue to work.
[27:07.850 --> 27:09.050]  So that's my advice.
[27:09.050 --> 27:11.290]  Get rid of the Azitrol, buy some Azimax,
[27:11.290 --> 27:13.450]  buy a little bit of Evergreen, and then you'll be clear.
[27:13.450 --> 27:16.410]  And then also try some Grandivo in the mix there.
[27:16.410 --> 27:18.490]  You should be pest-free.
[27:18.490 --> 27:20.670]  Hopefully all the other products we're trusting
[27:20.670 --> 27:22.190]  are putting in the bottle
[27:22.190 --> 27:23.350]  what we think they're putting in there
[27:23.350 --> 27:25.550]  because this is a little,
[27:25.550 --> 27:28.190]  this is the second time we've heard about a product
[27:28.190 --> 27:30.790]  being adulterated and making people fail tests.
[27:30.790 --> 27:32.990]  So hopefully it doesn't happen again.
[27:32.990 --> 27:36.350]  If you were in the pesticide industry, stop fucking around.
[27:36.350 --> 27:37.390]  Come on, quit lying to us.
[27:37.390 --> 27:39.390]  I'm sure there are huge fines and shit involved in this
[27:39.390 --> 27:42.070]  because this is, it says on the bottom,
[27:43.430 --> 27:45.810]  include misbranding of a pesticide product,
[27:45.810 --> 27:47.950]  adulteration of a pesticide product,
[27:47.950 --> 27:50.270]  and making false or misleading claims
[27:50.790 --> 27:52.070]  about a pesticide product.
[27:52.070 --> 27:53.050]  That sounds like important shit.
[27:53.050 --> 27:56.390]  That could probably be some federal shit, but I don't know.
[27:56.390 --> 27:58.150]  Anyway, let's move away from that
[27:58.150 --> 28:00.870]  and let's move into an email.
[28:00.870 --> 28:03.190]  I don't know if this person, let's scan it real quick.
[28:03.190 --> 28:05.750]  Okay, this person wants to call themselves Zombie.
[28:05.750 --> 28:06.710]  So shout out to Zombie.
[28:06.710 --> 28:07.710]  If you want to send me an email,
[28:07.710 --> 28:09.870]  it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[28:09.870 --> 28:11.750]  Let's read this email right here.
[28:11.750 --> 28:13.310]  It says, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[28:13.310 --> 28:14.950]  Long time listener here.
[28:14.950 --> 28:17.190]  And I'd first like to thank you for all the work you do.
[28:17.190 --> 28:20.550]  Your podcast is absolutely the best cannabis podcast
[28:20.550 --> 28:21.390]  I have found.
[28:21.390 --> 28:23.430]  Whether you're getting rambly by yourself
[28:23.430 --> 28:27.110]  or with a full table, it is so entertaining and informative.
[28:27.110 --> 28:29.990]  I do love it when y'all ramble.
[28:29.990 --> 28:31.350]  That's the best opening.
[28:31.350 --> 28:32.190]  I love that.
[28:32.190 --> 28:33.670]  You're very welcome.
[28:33.670 --> 28:34.950]  You said thank you right at the start.
[28:34.950 --> 28:36.190]  You're very welcome.
[28:36.190 --> 28:37.870]  And I love hearing that my podcast
[28:37.870 --> 28:40.070]  is absolutely the best cannabis podcast.
[28:40.070 --> 28:41.590]  That puts a huge smile on my face.
[28:41.590 --> 28:43.370]  And I like it that you like it when I'm by myself
[28:43.370 --> 28:45.030]  because I've been by myself lately.
[28:45.030 --> 28:46.870]  I've been recording late at night for some reason.
[28:47.510 --> 28:48.710]  It's just when I can find the time.
[28:48.710 --> 28:50.510]  I love it that you like it when I ramble
[28:50.510 --> 28:54.710]  because bro, I have been getting fucking rambly lately.
[28:55.950 --> 28:57.870]  Let's move on with the email a little bit.
[28:57.870 --> 29:00.310]  You go on to say, so with the obligatory praise
[29:00.310 --> 29:03.270]  out of the way, I have several questions for you.
[29:03.270 --> 29:06.150]  My wife is a travel nurse and we are going to Boulder
[29:06.150 --> 29:07.790]  for our next contract.
[29:07.790 --> 29:10.750]  We got married in Colorado and we love that state.
[29:10.750 --> 29:13.270]  We have been considering buying a house in Pueblo,
[29:13.270 --> 29:16.150]  but have not had a chance to come there yet.
[29:16.190 --> 29:17.950]  I was hoping you would be able to steer us
[29:17.950 --> 29:21.270]  in the right direction as far as areas to avoid
[29:21.270 --> 29:24.110]  and possibly areas to look into.
[29:24.110 --> 29:24.990]  All right.
[29:24.990 --> 29:27.790]  Now it's hard to give honest advice and opinions
[29:27.790 --> 29:30.110]  about a place when you've got negative things to say
[29:30.110 --> 29:31.450]  and you've got to live here.
[29:31.450 --> 29:32.950]  And I'm sure that a lot of people already know
[29:32.950 --> 29:35.070]  what I'm going to say, so we'll get right to it.
[29:35.070 --> 29:36.870]  If you come here and you plan to move here,
[29:36.870 --> 29:39.390]  I would not recommend you move to the East side.
[29:39.390 --> 29:40.990]  Every town's got its shitty side
[29:40.990 --> 29:43.390]  and the East side has a reputation
[29:43.390 --> 29:44.950]  for being the shitty side of town.
[29:44.950 --> 29:47.110]  So yes, there are good things on the East side.
[29:47.110 --> 29:48.510]  We've got a really cool skate park.
[29:48.510 --> 29:50.130]  There is good shit over there,
[29:50.130 --> 29:52.030]  but certain parts of the East side,
[29:52.030 --> 29:54.190]  you do not want to fuck around in.
[29:54.190 --> 29:56.150]  There are also parts of the West side
[29:56.150 --> 29:59.250]  that I would not recommend you fuck around in.
[29:59.250 --> 30:02.390]  Other than that, most of the town is pretty cool.
[30:02.390 --> 30:05.530]  It kind of depends on your preference and your income.
[30:05.530 --> 30:08.430]  And if you're trying to buy, or if you're trying to rent,
[30:08.430 --> 30:11.030]  it kind of depends on what you're looking to do.
[30:11.030 --> 30:14.710]  If you want to be right downtown, that's not too bad.
[30:15.470 --> 30:16.470]  It's going to be a little more expensive
[30:16.470 --> 30:17.790]  and you're not going to have any parking,
[30:17.790 --> 30:20.030]  but that's how it goes wherever you live downtown.
[30:20.030 --> 30:20.910]  So that's an option.
[30:20.910 --> 30:23.590]  If you want to be away from the people,
[30:23.590 --> 30:25.950]  I would recommend Pueblo County,
[30:25.950 --> 30:28.610]  like unincorporated Pueblo County.
[30:28.610 --> 30:31.450]  The grow rules are different, taxes are cheaper.
[30:31.450 --> 30:33.830]  If you want something a little more,
[30:33.830 --> 30:35.630]  it's kind of a little more privacy,
[30:35.630 --> 30:37.310]  a little newer, a little more modern.
[30:37.310 --> 30:41.150]  There's another city, it is 15 minutes West of Pueblo
[30:41.150 --> 30:42.630]  and it's called Pueblo West.
[30:42.630 --> 30:44.010]  That's a cool little spot.
[30:44.010 --> 30:46.650]  You can get a really big giant houses out there
[30:46.650 --> 30:48.090]  with a little more space.
[30:48.090 --> 30:49.690]  It's a little more expensive than Pueblo,
[30:49.690 --> 30:52.290]  but it's also cleaner, safer, and nicer.
[30:52.290 --> 30:55.650]  There's less traffic and it's more of a little upscale
[30:55.650 --> 30:58.850]  kind of a vibe and a more expensive kind of a community.
[30:58.850 --> 31:00.810]  One thing I can complain about Pueblo
[31:00.810 --> 31:02.690]  is there's no fucking food here.
[31:02.690 --> 31:04.610]  Around nine o'clock, if you're hungry,
[31:04.610 --> 31:08.210]  after 8.30, nine, maybe 10 o'clock, good luck.
[31:08.210 --> 31:09.650]  There's no food to be had here.
[31:09.650 --> 31:12.050]  There are those shitty burrito places,
[31:12.050 --> 31:13.250]  those places that they have everywhere,
[31:13.290 --> 31:15.650]  the Mexican food places that are open late.
[31:15.650 --> 31:18.270]  But if you're like me, you don't really prefer that.
[31:18.270 --> 31:19.930]  There's one place around here that I will eat at
[31:19.930 --> 31:22.330]  that's a little Mexican place, it closes at nine o'clock.
[31:22.330 --> 31:23.890]  So most of the food shuts down.
[31:23.890 --> 31:27.890]  There's not a lot of good food chains here,
[31:27.890 --> 31:29.330]  but they're coming, those things are coming.
[31:29.330 --> 31:31.710]  A lot of people talk a lot of shit about Pueblo, Colorado,
[31:31.710 --> 31:33.550]  but it is really changing and cannabis
[31:33.550 --> 31:35.590]  is really putting a big change on this place.
[31:35.590 --> 31:38.570]  Cannabis brings business, business brings money,
[31:38.570 --> 31:40.490]  money brings people, people bring more money.
[31:40.490 --> 31:42.190]  It's making a huge change here.
[31:42.190 --> 31:44.350]  But anyway, I would stay off the East side
[31:44.350 --> 31:46.070]  if you're trying to move here.
[31:46.070 --> 31:48.950]  Parts of the West side are shitty, decent places.
[31:48.950 --> 31:51.790]  The South side is pretty cool, it's mellow.
[31:51.790 --> 31:54.270]  Regency is not a bad area, it's affordable.
[31:54.270 --> 31:56.030]  The houses are a good size.
[31:56.030 --> 31:58.350]  It's not too far from schools and shopping and everything.
[31:58.350 --> 31:59.910]  It's right off of Pueblo Boulevard,
[31:59.910 --> 32:01.270]  so you can get everywhere quickly.
[32:01.270 --> 32:04.430]  It's not too far from I-25 and Highway 50.
[32:04.430 --> 32:06.310]  Regency is a pretty decent area.
[32:08.230 --> 32:10.150]  I think University Park on the North side
[32:10.150 --> 32:11.130]  is a pretty nice area.
[32:11.130 --> 32:12.210]  It's a little more expensive.
[32:12.210 --> 32:13.210]  The North side is cool.
[32:13.210 --> 32:15.010]  El Camino on the South side,
[32:15.010 --> 32:16.250]  if you're looking to buy a house,
[32:16.250 --> 32:18.390]  El Camino is a good area to buy.
[32:18.390 --> 32:19.770]  A semi-large house right now
[32:19.770 --> 32:21.850]  because a lot of people are moving out
[32:21.850 --> 32:23.650]  and they're upgrading to larger houses,
[32:23.650 --> 32:26.110]  leaving the houses in El Camino available.
[32:26.110 --> 32:28.970]  I talked about Pueblo West, I talked about the county.
[32:28.970 --> 32:30.290]  Those are the notes I wrote down
[32:30.290 --> 32:33.210]  for housing recommendations in Pueblo.
[32:33.210 --> 32:34.690]  If Pueblo is too small,
[32:34.690 --> 32:37.130]  a lot of people feel trapped in a small town like this.
[32:37.130 --> 32:38.430]  There's not a lot of food here,
[32:38.430 --> 32:39.610]  there's not a lot of options here.
[32:40.610 --> 32:43.010]  It's an older town with a different type of mentality
[32:43.010 --> 32:43.930]  that is evolving.
[32:43.930 --> 32:46.650]  It's getting there, but it's not quite there yet.
[32:46.650 --> 32:48.090]  People ask me why I don't leave here.
[32:48.090 --> 32:50.090]  It's because I'm proud of it and I see potential
[32:50.090 --> 32:51.330]  and I see what's coming.
[32:51.330 --> 32:52.370]  And I've been here for so long
[32:52.370 --> 32:54.570]  that I feel like I can't abandon the city
[32:54.570 --> 32:55.810]  that let me be me.
[32:56.910 --> 32:58.670]  I flourished as a person here.
[32:58.670 --> 33:01.570]  I really became what I am here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[33:01.570 --> 33:02.750]  So I can't abandon this place.
[33:02.750 --> 33:04.050]  I'm watching it become something
[33:04.050 --> 33:05.850]  and I'm proud of this little place.
[33:05.850 --> 33:07.570]  But if it's not for you, I understand that.
[33:07.570 --> 33:08.570]  If it's too small for you,
[33:08.570 --> 33:10.870]  if it's not your thing, I get that.
[33:10.870 --> 33:12.090]  A lot of people leave here.
[33:12.090 --> 33:14.230]  There's a slightly aggressive vibe here.
[33:14.230 --> 33:16.410]  We've got a steel mill and shit like that.
[33:16.410 --> 33:17.610]  But it's just a different vibe.
[33:17.610 --> 33:20.730]  It's a hardworking, steel-toed boots, leather jacket
[33:20.730 --> 33:23.890]  kind of a vibe here with a lot of the community.
[33:23.890 --> 33:25.450]  So it's not for a lot of people.
[33:25.450 --> 33:27.090]  If you're into a bigger city,
[33:27.090 --> 33:29.770]  Colorado Springs is really cool.
[33:29.770 --> 33:32.770]  It's a little more military vibe, but it's got more stuff.
[33:32.770 --> 33:34.370]  You can get food after nine o'clock.
[33:34.370 --> 33:36.610]  It's got all of the restaurants you can think of.
[33:36.610 --> 33:38.250]  They're there, all of the stores.
[33:38.930 --> 33:40.410]  They're all there.
[33:40.410 --> 33:41.770]  A lot of the Pueblo stores are kind of,
[33:41.770 --> 33:44.390]  we get the smaller version of all the stores.
[33:45.290 --> 33:47.930]  But that's just small bullshit complaints.
[33:47.930 --> 33:51.390]  Anyway, let me move on with this email
[33:51.390 --> 33:52.290]  because there's more to it.
[33:52.290 --> 33:54.230]  He also says, also, while there's no shortage
[33:54.230 --> 33:55.770]  of dispensaries where I'll be,
[33:55.770 --> 33:58.510]  the last time I visited, quality varied widely
[33:58.510 --> 34:00.370]  from location to location.
[34:00.370 --> 34:03.850]  What's your current recommendation for best quality?
[34:03.850 --> 34:06.690]  Well, obviously, since I work for Three Rivers,
[34:06.690 --> 34:08.690]  I'm going to say that I would recommend you go
[34:08.690 --> 34:11.370]  to Three Rivers in Pueblo, Colorado,
[34:11.370 --> 34:13.250]  and you shop on the recreational side.
[34:13.250 --> 34:15.810]  Excuse me, I tried to burp into the microphone again.
[34:15.810 --> 34:17.450]  When you walk into Three Rivers,
[34:17.450 --> 34:18.870]  you can go left or you can go right.
[34:18.870 --> 34:20.450]  There are two windows to walk to.
[34:20.450 --> 34:22.130]  The left window is recreational.
[34:22.130 --> 34:23.250]  The right window is medical.
[34:23.250 --> 34:24.710]  If you don't have a medical card,
[34:24.710 --> 34:27.250]  anybody 21 and over with an ID can shop over there
[34:27.250 --> 34:28.690]  on the recreational side.
[34:28.690 --> 34:30.650]  There is great product there.
[34:30.650 --> 34:32.490]  That product is not grown in my facility.
[34:32.490 --> 34:34.650]  That product is grown by a good friend of mine,
[34:34.650 --> 34:35.730]  and I trust that product.
[34:35.730 --> 34:36.770]  I know who grows that.
[34:36.770 --> 34:37.850]  I know how it's grown.
[34:37.850 --> 34:40.530]  It's grown with the same methods and techniques as my grow,
[34:40.530 --> 34:42.250]  just in another building.
[34:42.250 --> 34:43.930]  So I would recommend Three Rivers.
[34:43.930 --> 34:45.050]  That's in Pueblo.
[34:45.050 --> 34:47.450]  If you can't make it to Pueblo,
[34:47.450 --> 34:50.050]  I would check out the recreational side
[34:50.050 --> 34:51.690]  of Kind Love in Denver.
[34:51.690 --> 34:53.530]  That's one of the best dispensaries.
[34:53.530 --> 34:55.850]  I honestly don't have a lot of other recommendations
[34:55.850 --> 34:57.930]  in Denver because I don't shop at dispensaries.
[34:57.930 --> 34:59.970]  I don't go to a lot of dispensaries
[34:59.970 --> 35:02.650]  because I'm mostly self-deficient,
[35:02.650 --> 35:03.690]  is almost what I said.
[35:03.690 --> 35:04.890]  I'm mostly self-sufficient,
[35:04.890 --> 35:06.650]  and I don't have to do a lot of shopping.
[35:06.650 --> 35:09.050]  If I do shopping, I just go buy extracts,
[35:09.050 --> 35:11.610]  and I usually go to Apothecary for that.
[35:12.450 --> 35:15.610]  But quality will vary, and that's one strange thing is,
[35:15.610 --> 35:17.690]  from batch to batch, from vendor to vendor,
[35:17.690 --> 35:19.890]  stuff will be so different sometimes,
[35:19.890 --> 35:21.410]  and sometimes it's hard to predict.
[35:21.410 --> 35:24.890]  So I think your best bet would be to go to Three Rivers
[35:24.890 --> 35:26.970]  and go to the recreational side there,
[35:26.970 --> 35:31.050]  or go to Kind Love in Denver and get product there
[35:31.050 --> 35:35.970]  because in Colorado Springs, it is all medical product.
[35:35.970 --> 35:37.090]  It looks like you're gonna be in Boulder.
[35:37.090 --> 35:38.850]  Your email says that you're going to Boulder.
[35:38.850 --> 35:42.050]  I am not too familiar with dispensaries in Boulder.
[35:42.050 --> 35:44.410]  I would recommend going to Weedmaps.
[35:44.410 --> 35:46.090]  Download Weedmaps on your phone,
[35:46.090 --> 35:49.090]  open up Weedmaps and check out the reviews on dispensaries,
[35:49.090 --> 35:50.330]  and then if there's a certain strain
[35:50.330 --> 35:51.410]  you're looking for or something,
[35:51.410 --> 35:54.370]  maybe that'll help you decide which dispensary to go to.
[35:54.370 --> 35:57.970]  But oftentimes, you can tell when you drive by a dispensary
[35:57.970 --> 35:59.490]  if it's somewhere you wanna go.
[35:59.490 --> 36:02.970]  Here's a weird, if you get a feeling at a dispensary,
[36:02.970 --> 36:05.530]  like, fuck this place, or ooh, I don't know,
[36:05.530 --> 36:06.930]  you don't have to shop there.
[36:06.930 --> 36:07.770]  You can leave.
[36:07.770 --> 36:09.330]  There are a lot more to go to.
[36:09.330 --> 36:10.610]  So you'll get a feeling.
[36:10.610 --> 36:12.850]  That's usually, it's just like the same way
[36:12.850 --> 36:14.970]  that people choose their liquor stores
[36:14.970 --> 36:17.090]  or their bar that they drink at or whatever.
[36:17.090 --> 36:19.670]  We choose our dispensaries very similarly.
[36:19.670 --> 36:20.610]  You just get a vibe.
[36:20.610 --> 36:22.250]  You go in, you either love it or hate it,
[36:22.250 --> 36:23.290]  and if you love it, you go back.
[36:23.290 --> 36:25.610]  If you hate it, you don't go back.
[36:25.610 --> 36:26.690]  So check them out.
[36:26.690 --> 36:28.530]  Go into one and don't be afraid to walk out
[36:28.570 --> 36:29.530]  without spending anything.
[36:29.530 --> 36:30.370]  Just be like, all right, man,
[36:30.370 --> 36:32.010]  I don't see what I was looking for.
[36:32.010 --> 36:33.350]  And they may act weird to you.
[36:33.350 --> 36:35.090]  They may act like you wasted their time,
[36:35.090 --> 36:37.450]  but you did not waste anybody's time.
[36:37.450 --> 36:38.950]  You found out what you needed to find out,
[36:38.950 --> 36:40.770]  which is their products are not what you need.
[36:40.770 --> 36:42.970]  You're not required to spend anything.
[36:42.970 --> 36:44.890]  You're not expected to spend money.
[36:44.890 --> 36:46.450]  If you go to Target or Walmart,
[36:46.450 --> 36:48.330]  you can walk in and not find what you want,
[36:48.330 --> 36:49.210]  and then you can leave.
[36:49.210 --> 36:50.670]  You can do the same thing at the dispensary.
[36:50.670 --> 36:53.210]  So while you're in Boulder, check them out.
[36:53.210 --> 36:55.810]  Get on Weedmaps, get some recommendations.
[36:55.810 --> 36:57.050]  All right, there's more to the email.
[36:57.050 --> 37:00.070]  He says, assuming I get a Colorado license right away,
[37:00.070 --> 37:02.730]  how long is the process for getting
[37:02.730 --> 37:04.290]  a medical marijuana card?
[37:04.290 --> 37:06.490]  So when you move here, you'll get an ID.
[37:06.490 --> 37:08.370]  All you need is that ID,
[37:08.370 --> 37:11.490]  and then immediately you can go to the marijuana doctor.
[37:11.490 --> 37:14.130]  The hardest part of that may be setting the appointment.
[37:14.130 --> 37:15.890]  Some places can get you in right away.
[37:15.890 --> 37:17.690]  Some doctors are pretty backed up.
[37:17.690 --> 37:20.770]  It just depends on if you can find a place to get you in.
[37:20.770 --> 37:22.890]  Some places they'll get you in that day.
[37:22.890 --> 37:24.470]  If they get you in that day,
[37:24.470 --> 37:26.750]  they will fill out your paperwork for you online.
[37:27.450 --> 37:28.510]  If you can do an online registration,
[37:28.510 --> 37:31.070]  which I'm sure you can, it just takes a couple of clicks,
[37:31.070 --> 37:33.870]  you will have your medical marijuana card within 48 hours.
[37:33.870 --> 37:36.310]  When I did it, my card was approved,
[37:36.310 --> 37:38.230]  and I was able to digitally print off
[37:38.230 --> 37:40.470]  my renewed card within 24 hours.
[37:40.470 --> 37:42.630]  It was 12 hours later, honestly.
[37:42.630 --> 37:44.270]  I turned it in at like two o'clock,
[37:44.270 --> 37:45.410]  and like two o'clock that morning,
[37:45.410 --> 37:48.110]  I got an email saying, hey, you've got your card.
[37:48.110 --> 37:50.350]  So it shouldn't be too long, I don't think,
[37:50.350 --> 37:53.170]  for a brand new card registering online.
[37:53.170 --> 37:56.430]  I think it could be as quickly from having your license
[37:57.110 --> 37:58.750]  to getting the doctor appointment may be the hard part.
[37:58.750 --> 38:01.390]  Once you see the doc, I think 48 hours from there,
[38:01.390 --> 38:02.710]  you should have a card.
[38:02.710 --> 38:04.390]  I can't promise you that,
[38:04.390 --> 38:06.070]  but for a renewal, that's all it took.
[38:06.070 --> 38:09.550]  For a brand new card, I don't think it should be much longer.
[38:09.550 --> 38:12.430]  Then to wrap up the email, our friend Zombie says,
[38:12.430 --> 38:14.070]  obviously I'd love to meet you and your crew
[38:14.070 --> 38:15.190]  and dab the fuck out.
[38:15.190 --> 38:16.790]  And then he says, who wouldn't?
[38:16.790 --> 38:17.630]  I love hearing that.
[38:17.630 --> 38:18.590]  Who wouldn't wanna come dab with us?
[38:18.590 --> 38:19.550]  Come on, you guys, come dab.
[38:19.550 --> 38:22.310]  We need to do a grow from your heart dab session.
[38:22.310 --> 38:23.550]  Then he says, but short of that,
[38:23.550 --> 38:24.890]  any help with the above questions
[38:24.890 --> 38:26.730]  would be greatly appreciated.
[38:26.730 --> 38:28.950]  Then he says, one love from Zombie.
[38:28.950 --> 38:31.450]  Hey bro, I hope I answered all of your questions
[38:31.450 --> 38:33.370]  thoroughly and appropriately.
[38:33.370 --> 38:34.750]  And if I sparked warning questions,
[38:34.750 --> 38:37.930]  just send me an email and I will answer them
[38:37.930 --> 38:38.890]  a little more for you.
[38:38.890 --> 38:40.530]  Hey, when you come to Colorado,
[38:40.530 --> 38:42.090]  if you can come down to Pueblo and visit,
[38:42.090 --> 38:42.930]  I'd love to meet you, bro.
[38:42.930 --> 38:44.730]  I've got some dabs, I've got some turps,
[38:44.730 --> 38:46.510]  I've got a clean rig.
[38:46.510 --> 38:48.250]  If you've got a cool voice and some shit to say,
[38:48.250 --> 38:49.610]  I've also got another microphone
[38:49.610 --> 38:51.010]  who will put you on a podcast.
[38:51.010 --> 38:52.110]  Thanks for the email, dude.
[38:52.110 --> 38:53.530]  If anybody wants to email me,
[38:53.610 --> 38:55.650]  it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[38:55.650 --> 38:57.410]  I would love to hear from you.

[38:58.650 --> 39:00.850]  I've been going for close to 40 minutes now.

[39:30.050 --> 39:31.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be back Thursday
[39:31.530 --> 39:33.330]  with the Throwback Thursday episode.
[39:33.330 --> 39:34.590]  And then of course, I'll be back Monday
[39:34.590 --> 39:36.490]  with a brand new episode.
[39:36.490 --> 39:38.570]  I hope everybody had a safe and fun 7-10
[39:38.570 --> 39:40.010]  taking dabs with me.
[39:40.010 --> 39:42.130]  I want to give a huge shout out to Alaska Matt.
[39:42.130 --> 39:44.290]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[39:44.290 --> 39:45.690]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[39:45.690 --> 39:46.530]  Let's do it.
[39:46.530 --> 39:48.530]  Yeah, y'all check it out.
[39:48.530 --> 39:50.230]  Yo, check it out.
[40:20.890 --> 40:22.730]  I doubt I'll ever make it back.
[40:22.730 --> 40:23.990]  I see the way you act.
[40:23.990 --> 40:25.330]  Cut the jealous crap.
[40:25.330 --> 40:26.490]  Something's fishy here.
[40:26.490 --> 40:27.970]  I think I smell a rat.
[40:27.970 --> 40:30.130]  This is our house, but we ain't gotta tell him that.
[40:30.130 --> 40:31.570]  Let's leave them at the front door
[40:31.570 --> 40:33.170]  yelling at the welcome mat.
[40:33.170 --> 40:35.610]  Come on everybody, get another dab pack.
[40:35.610 --> 40:38.350]  Same routine, slightly different from the last track.
[40:38.350 --> 40:40.810]  A million songs about we, but where the dabs at?
[40:40.810 --> 40:42.150]  You don't like my dabbing songs,
[40:42.150 --> 40:43.770]  you can kiss my ass crack.
[40:43.770 --> 40:46.150]  Come on everybody, drop another huge bomb.
[40:46.150 --> 40:48.830]  420 came 7-10, it's time to move on.
[40:48.830 --> 40:51.330]  Upgrade your tolerance, downside your new bones
[40:51.330 --> 40:54.330]  Favorite way to medicate, I don't think it's too strong
[40:54.330 --> 40:56.330]  All my fans, I'ma make them bounce
[40:56.330 --> 40:57.830]  Like my checks from my bank account
[40:57.830 --> 40:59.330]  When I write in fake amounts
[40:59.330 --> 41:02.330]  I love the paper stacks, but I hate the count
[41:02.330 --> 41:04.830]  Lumberjack, run a half to an eighth an ounce
[41:04.830 --> 41:07.330]  Some would say that I'm stuck on a bad earth
[41:07.330 --> 41:09.830]  I would say those people suck like a bag purge
[41:09.830 --> 41:11.830]  The hash surgeon, workin' a dish
[41:11.830 --> 41:14.830]  Then teachin' the plants to man so he learns how to fish
[41:14.830 --> 41:17.830]  Oil up the butter pan, Linus is the brother man
[41:17.830 --> 41:20.830]  I'm the number one producer so I don't need another fan
[41:20.830 --> 41:22.830]  But y'all don't understand anyway
[41:22.830 --> 41:25.830]  Yap about money while we rubber band everyday
[41:25.830 --> 41:27.830]  And when I say hit the trees
[41:27.830 --> 41:31.830]  I mean up by the honey hive, chillin' with the bees
[41:31.830 --> 41:34.330]  Fuck sticks and seeds, I want all different breeds
[41:34.330 --> 41:36.330]  And consistencies, it go
[41:36.330 --> 41:38.830]  Come on everybody, get another dab pack
[41:38.830 --> 41:41.330]  Same routine, slightly different from the last track
[41:41.330 --> 41:43.830]  A million songs about weed, but where the dabs at?
[41:43.830 --> 41:46.830]  You don't like my dabbing songs? You can kiss my ass crack
[41:46.830 --> 41:48.830]  Come on everybody, drop another huge bong
[41:48.830 --> 41:51.830]  Core 20 came, 7-10, it's time to move on
[41:51.830 --> 41:54.330]  Upgrade your tolerance, downsize your new bong
[41:54.330 --> 41:56.830]  Favorite way to medicate, I don't think it's too strong
