[00:01.280 --> 00:04.280]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[00:04.280 --> 00:10.040]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 617 of the Grow From Your
[00:10.040 --> 00:11.040]  Heart podcast.
[00:11.040 --> 00:14.620]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of grow questions.
[00:14.620 --> 00:18.940]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:18.940 --> 00:23.920]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:23.920 --> 00:25.220]  level or higher.
[00:25.220 --> 00:28.580]  So with no further ado, let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:28.580 --> 00:30.900]  Thank you, shout out to my friend Frankie.
[00:30.900 --> 00:34.140]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Stash Drop and Evil Grow.
[00:34.140 --> 00:37.340]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Popperoni and Tree Star Meadow.

[00:40.680 --> 00:43.680]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Tonto and Danky Dave.
[00:43.680 --> 00:47.500]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to Guido Grows and Dave's
[00:47.500 --> 00:48.500]  Not Here.
[00:48.500 --> 00:52.340]  And let's wrap it up with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[00:52.340 --> 00:55.080]  my friend Guy-Uti Grows.

[01:15.860 --> 01:19.820]  to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:19.820 --> 01:24.020]  Speaking of show notes and video descriptions, I want to send a big thank you to everybody
[01:24.020 --> 01:27.100]  who has subscribed to the YouTube channel.
[01:27.100 --> 01:29.980]  That's right, I've been making a little more effort to make the videos better.
[01:29.980 --> 01:32.420]  I recently upgraded to brand new equipment.
[01:32.420 --> 01:33.420]  I've got a new camera.
[01:33.420 --> 01:35.500]  The camera's been here, but I've got a fancy camera.
[01:35.500 --> 01:38.260]  Got some fancy lighting, got this fancy set going on.
[01:38.260 --> 01:43.220]  And the YouTube channel has just passed 6,000 subscribers.
[01:43.220 --> 01:47.500]  So big thanks and big shout out to everybody who subscribes to us on the YouTube channel.
[01:47.500 --> 01:49.300]  I truly appreciate that.
[01:49.300 --> 01:53.260]  Also, I want to send a special thank you to everybody who subscribes and follows me on
[01:53.260 --> 01:55.540]  Cannabuzz.
[01:55.540 --> 02:01.060]  I just surpassed 57,000 followers on Cannabuzz.
[02:01.060 --> 02:03.020]  That is a tremendous number.
[02:03.020 --> 02:06.140]  It's almost twice the number of followers I've got on Instagram.
[02:06.140 --> 02:09.600]  So big shout out to everybody who follows us on Cannabuzz.
[02:09.600 --> 02:14.100]  If you're not already following me on Cannabuzz, I invite you, I encourage you, I implore you

[02:28.860 --> 02:32.580]  of you taking dabs and doing bong rips that they take down on Instagram.

[03:33.860 --> 03:35.060]  I would appreciate it.
[03:35.060 --> 03:36.060]  All right.
[03:36.060 --> 03:37.060]  Where are we going to go from there?
[03:37.060 --> 03:39.580]  I do have a couple of great emails highlighted for you guys.
[03:39.580 --> 03:40.780]  Let's not waste a lot of time.
[03:40.780 --> 03:43.620]  That music ended just right on time for me.
[03:43.620 --> 03:48.260]  The first question for today's message, I actually got this question from several people,
[03:48.260 --> 03:51.220]  so I kind of paraphrased the emails here.
[03:51.220 --> 03:53.540]  The first question goes a little bit like this.
[03:53.540 --> 03:57.380]  It basically said, hey, Ross to Jeff, in the past couple of episodes, you've talked about
[03:57.380 --> 04:00.900]  being a seed breeder, a seed vendor, a seed seller, a seed maker.
[04:00.900 --> 04:02.860]  A lot of people have talked about your seeds a lot.
[04:02.860 --> 04:06.760]  We see you on social media, but what you don't say, other than that one quick commercial
[04:06.760 --> 04:10.580]  at the start of the show is, where can we get your seeds?
[04:10.580 --> 04:12.260]  That is a very good question.
[04:12.260 --> 04:15.940]  We will talk about that briefly here on the podcast.
[04:15.940 --> 04:19.300]  Just in case you're not aware, I am iRegenetics Premium Seeds.
[04:19.300 --> 04:20.300]  That is me.
[04:20.380 --> 04:22.020]  I am a seed proprietor, sole breeder.
[04:22.020 --> 04:26.700]  I do 99.9% of the work for iRegenetics Premium Seeds.
[04:26.700 --> 04:30.780]  I do have a lovely friend who, partner in crime if you want to call her that, who helps
[04:30.780 --> 04:32.460]  me package up a lot of the seeds.
[04:32.460 --> 04:33.620]  I do the seed selecting.
[04:33.620 --> 04:35.300]  She does a little bit of the packaging.
[04:35.300 --> 04:36.300]  She does the heat sealing.
[04:36.300 --> 04:37.300]  It's done by her.
[04:37.300 --> 04:41.220]  I also have another lovely person who does a lot of the shipping for me, so shout out
[04:41.220 --> 04:43.380]  to both of them for keeping me moving.
[04:43.380 --> 04:49.500]  But 99.something percent of iRegenetics Premium Seeds is all done by me, by Ross to Jeff.
[04:49.500 --> 04:52.100]  You guys see a lot of that stuff on the social media.
[04:52.100 --> 04:55.020]  Where can we get the seeds is the main point of this rambling.
[04:55.020 --> 04:58.660]  I do have, of course, at the start of the podcast, if you're listening to the podcast
[04:58.660 --> 05:01.800]  on the audio form, you hear that Seeds Here Now commercial.
[05:01.800 --> 05:05.940]  The number one place I would recommend to get seeds of any brand from any breeder is
[05:05.940 --> 05:07.620]  seedsherenow.com.
[05:07.620 --> 05:11.820]  Of course, use coupon code GFYH10 at seedsherenow.com.
[05:11.820 --> 05:15.100]  That will save you 10% off of your entire order.
[05:15.100 --> 05:19.740]  seedsherenow.com has a great selection, not only of my seeds, but a lot of other people's
[05:19.740 --> 05:20.740]  seeds.
[05:20.740 --> 05:24.060]  Also, seedsherenow.com quite often gets my first releases.
[05:24.060 --> 05:28.700]  I like to make my first drop, debut drops go to seedsherenow.com.
[05:28.700 --> 05:33.360]  The next place I would recommend to get seeds, and these are kind of in no particular order.
[05:33.360 --> 05:42.620]  The next place I would say is the Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[05:42.620 --> 05:45.060]  Dankseed.store is a great place to find them.
[05:45.140 --> 05:49.500]  The Heritage Seed Bank is a great place to find iReed genetic seeds.
[05:49.500 --> 05:54.380]  Another good spot to find my seeds is the Golden Ticket Seed Bank.
[05:54.380 --> 05:58.880]  To the best of my knowledge, Golden Ticket and Heritage both do auctions on Instagram.
[05:58.880 --> 06:01.620]  So if you've got an Instagram, find them on Instagram.
[06:01.620 --> 06:06.540]  Maybe you can catch some auctions from Golden Ticket or Heritage Seeds on the Instagram.
[06:06.540 --> 06:09.700]  Be careful with the words you use and the things you say on Instagram because you don't
[06:09.700 --> 06:11.860]  want to get their account taken down.
[06:11.860 --> 06:17.580]  So if you do make a PayPal payment to somebody for seeds or a Venmo payment or some type
[06:17.580 --> 06:22.620]  of payment where you're sending digital money for seeds, don't put the words for seeds in
[06:22.620 --> 06:26.900]  the PayPal or in the notes or whatever because a lot of those companies don't like seeds.
[06:26.900 --> 06:28.180]  Just be a little more careful with that.
[06:28.180 --> 06:29.180]  Be a little bit more discreet.
[06:29.180 --> 06:33.220]  I know you're not on the hustler side of life, but let's keep the hustlers safe and keep
[06:33.220 --> 06:34.840]  them secure.
[06:34.840 --> 06:39.180]  If you put seeds or certain strain names, if you put the word kush or something like
[06:39.180 --> 06:43.060]  that in a PayPal payment, PayPal will flag that payment.
[06:43.060 --> 06:46.660]  It will take 30 to 90 days for that person to receive that payment.
[06:46.660 --> 06:50.340]  If they receive that payment, if PayPal deems that that account has been doing suspicious
[06:50.340 --> 06:52.920]  or fraudulent activity, they will freeze the account.
[06:52.920 --> 06:56.460]  They will seize the assets which are in the account and they will use those accounts to
[06:56.460 --> 06:59.220]  investigate your fraudulent activity.
[06:59.220 --> 07:02.860]  Once they have depleted your funds and investigations, they forget about it.
[07:02.860 --> 07:03.860]  They cancel the claim.
[07:03.860 --> 07:05.840]  They delete your account and it's game over.
[07:05.840 --> 07:10.680]  So please, you guys, if you're buying seeds from anybody or if you're buying anything
[07:10.680 --> 07:13.040]  on the internet, be careful what you're putting in the notes.
[07:13.040 --> 07:14.040]  Don't put the words kush.
[07:14.040 --> 07:15.040]  Don't put mushrooms.
[07:15.040 --> 07:16.040]  Don't put seeds.
[07:16.040 --> 07:17.440]  I don't know what you're buying.
[07:17.440 --> 07:20.840]  You could be buying a shirt with mushrooms on the shirt.
[07:20.840 --> 07:24.540]  Let's still not type the word mushrooms in there just because that is going to flag the
[07:24.540 --> 07:27.360]  algorithm on your pay application.
[07:27.360 --> 07:30.320]  So let's be a little bit more careful when we're doing stuff like that.
[07:30.320 --> 07:33.800]  That was a side rant, but I feel like that was very important for a lot of people out
[07:33.800 --> 07:34.800]  there.
[07:34.800 --> 07:35.800]  Let's protect each other.
[07:35.800 --> 07:38.400]  The seed sellers and vendors send you seeds.
[07:38.400 --> 07:43.000]  We slash they do our best to make sure everything is discreetly and securely packaged so that
[07:43.000 --> 07:45.120]  wherever those seeds are going, they are safe.
[07:45.120 --> 07:49.360]  It is your responsibility once they arrive to understand the laws and legalities in your
[07:49.360 --> 07:52.000]  area on how you handle those seeds.
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.160]  As far as I'm concerned, don't get them wet and dirty unless that is legal in your jurisdiction
[07:57.160 --> 07:58.160]  where those seeds are located.
[07:58.160 --> 08:00.840]  I'm going to get back on track here.
[08:00.840 --> 08:01.840]  Where can we get seeds?
[08:01.840 --> 08:03.280]  Of course, seedsherenow.com.
[08:03.280 --> 08:05.400]  Use coupon code GFYH10.
[08:05.400 --> 08:08.000]  That is my recommended vendor of choice.
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.080]  The Hella Dank Seed Company at dankseed.store.
[08:11.080 --> 08:12.400]  Heritage Seed Bank at Heritage.
[08:12.400 --> 08:14.400]  I want to say heritageseedbank.com.
[08:14.400 --> 08:15.400]  I could be wrong.
[08:15.400 --> 08:17.320]  It could be heritageseeds.com.
[08:17.320 --> 08:21.000]  I will put an accurate list in the show notes.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.900]  Also Golden Ticket Seed Bank is a wonderful place for my seeds.
[08:24.900 --> 08:28.600]  Another place I recommend getting my seeds, a new vendor that I just added to my list,
[08:28.600 --> 08:30.440]  is El Fuego Seeds.
[08:30.440 --> 08:33.640]  El Fuego Seeds does officially carry iRegenetics.
[08:33.680 --> 08:38.120]  If you see them out there offering my seeds and you're questioning that, that is official.
[08:38.120 --> 08:40.680]  Another official vendor is Hype Seeds.
[08:40.680 --> 08:42.840]  Hype Seeds is a new vendor.
[08:42.840 --> 08:44.280]  They do have my seeds.
[08:44.280 --> 08:47.560]  There are a couple of more people coming online within the next few months.
[08:47.560 --> 08:49.360]  I've got a couple of emails to catch up on.
[08:49.360 --> 08:51.680]  We will add some more vendors to that list.
[08:51.680 --> 08:55.400]  I wanted to make sure that you guys have a solid list of where to get those.
[08:55.400 --> 08:59.360]  One thing I can recommend is that you go to my website, iRegenetics.com.
[08:59.360 --> 09:02.720]  There is a vendor list on iRegenetics.com.
[09:02.720 --> 09:04.280]  You can click right on those vendors.
[09:04.280 --> 09:05.560]  It will take you to their website.
[09:05.560 --> 09:07.560]  It will take you to my page on the website.
[09:07.560 --> 09:10.860]  You can see what of my strains are available on each website.
[09:10.860 --> 09:12.040]  You can see what's available.
[09:12.040 --> 09:14.180]  You can see what coupon codes are available.
[09:14.180 --> 09:17.960]  You can put them in the shopping cart and see who has better shipping, less taxes, what's
[09:17.960 --> 09:18.960]  available.
[09:18.960 --> 09:22.080]  You can build and customize your order there by shopping on the different vendors at the
[09:22.080 --> 09:23.720]  different websites.
[09:23.720 --> 09:28.480]  Another thing I want to mention is if you sign up for my MailChimp mailing list, there's
[09:28.480 --> 09:33.000]  a thing that says stay in touch or keep in touch or join the mailing list, something
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.600]  like that on the website.
[09:34.600 --> 09:38.520]  If you put in your mailing information about once a month, maybe every two weeks, I try
[09:38.520 --> 09:39.840]  not to spam you too much.
[09:39.840 --> 09:41.880]  I also try not to forget about it.
[09:41.880 --> 09:46.920]  I will send an email via my MailChimp web service that will remind you of all of the
[09:46.920 --> 09:51.600]  coupon codes, new vendor drops, maybe new vendors that haven't added to the website
[09:51.600 --> 09:56.000]  yet, maybe new exclusive deals, maybe merchandise exclusives.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.720]  Maybe I'm going to do a live show that not everybody will know about.
[09:58.720 --> 10:04.480]  I will include that sort of stuff on the MailChimp newsletter.
[10:04.480 --> 10:09.720]  Seeds here now, Heritage Seeds, Golden Ticket Seed Bank, Helladink Seed Company, El Fuego
[10:09.720 --> 10:12.560]  Seeds and Hype Seeds are my recommended vendors.
[10:12.560 --> 10:16.440]  You can find most of them on my website at ieregenetics.com.
[10:16.440 --> 10:18.320]  I apologize to El Fuego and Hype Seeds.
[10:18.320 --> 10:21.240]  I haven't added you guys to the website yet.
[10:21.240 --> 10:22.240]  There's a couple of reasons.
[10:22.240 --> 10:25.120]  Honestly, I'm giving you a couple of time to make sure that you guys keep going and
[10:25.120 --> 10:27.800]  also it cost me a little bit to do adjustments to the website.
[10:27.800 --> 10:29.960]  I want to make sure you're going to keep going before I add you on there.
[10:29.960 --> 10:31.560]  I don't want to have to remove you.
[10:31.560 --> 10:35.760]  I want to make sure it's real before I make it internet official.
[10:35.760 --> 10:38.580]  Maybe if I add you on there, you'll sell some more seeds and we'll keep you going, but this
[10:38.580 --> 10:40.880]  should give you a little bit of a boost.
[10:40.880 --> 10:46.200]  El Fuego Seeds and Hype Seeds are official new vendors for ieregenetic seeds.
[10:46.200 --> 10:48.600]  Of course, my favorite is seedsherenow.com.
[10:48.600 --> 10:52.080]  Don't forget seedsherenow.com and use coupon code GFYH10.
[10:52.080 --> 10:53.720]  Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[10:53.720 --> 10:57.560]  There are more great places to acquire ieregenetic seeds.
[10:57.560 --> 11:01.960]  One of my favorite places, I mentioned it a moment ago, is Cannabuzz.
[11:01.960 --> 11:06.480]  There are a couple of people who do auctions for ieregenetic seeds on Cannabuzz.
[11:06.480 --> 11:07.480]  I am one of them.
[11:07.480 --> 11:12.440]  If you follow me on Cannabuzz, follow the official ieregenetics page, you will see auctions.
[11:12.440 --> 11:15.640]  When I've got time, when I know that I'll be available that evening, I post up an auction
[11:15.640 --> 11:17.160]  on Cannabuzz.
[11:17.160 --> 11:21.400]  Sometimes I do it for rare, unreleased, exclusive, limited edition seeds.
[11:21.400 --> 11:24.920]  I'll put up some packs that have never been seen or that will never go to the vendors
[11:24.920 --> 11:25.920]  I listed above.
[11:25.920 --> 11:29.160]  That way you guys can get some stuff that's been in my vault that I decided I'm never
[11:29.160 --> 11:30.160]  going to grow.
[11:30.160 --> 11:33.360]  You guys can get a crack at some gems, get some good shit.
[11:33.360 --> 11:37.200]  Occasionally, I'll put up bulk packs of something, like three or four packs of stuff I've got
[11:37.200 --> 11:38.200]  a lot of.
[11:38.200 --> 11:41.240]  Maybe I just spent the evening packing up something, realized I got a whole bunch of
[11:41.240 --> 11:42.240]  these seeds.
[11:42.240 --> 11:43.800]  We'll put a couple of auctions for those up.
[11:43.800 --> 11:48.820]  The Cannabuzz place is a great spot to grab some seeds for great prices.
[11:48.820 --> 11:52.620]  Sometimes those auctions do get a little bit spendy, but sometimes there are some hot
[11:52.620 --> 11:54.060]  steals on there.
[11:54.060 --> 11:57.820]  If I put up a pack that everybody's already got, you may be able to get it for a really
[11:57.820 --> 11:59.260]  good, good price.
[11:59.260 --> 12:02.380]  You just got to bid, see if you get outbid, see if you win it.
[12:02.380 --> 12:07.980]  You might get a steal on one or multiple packs on Cannabuzz.
[12:07.980 --> 12:12.540]  Another great place to get ieregenetic seeds, this is starting to sound like a fucking infomercial.
[12:12.540 --> 12:14.800]  We're going to wrap this part up really soon.
[12:14.800 --> 12:20.800]  Another place to get good ieregenetic seeds is on the ieregenetics discord.
[12:20.800 --> 12:21.800]  That's right.
[12:21.800 --> 12:25.000]  We've got an ieregenetics discord channel, a discord server.
[12:25.000 --> 12:26.800]  Shout out to my buddy Dave.
[12:26.800 --> 12:31.360]  Dave's not here, does host auctions on the discord server.
[12:31.360 --> 12:36.000]  Most of the time that is going to be for rare gems from the iere vault, things that I selected,
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.880]  things that I packed up and Dave is taking the time and the work to auction them for
[12:39.880 --> 12:44.520]  me because honestly, I should be here writing, recording, doing podcasts, editing shows,
[12:44.520 --> 12:46.880]  working in the garden, packing up seeds.
[12:46.880 --> 12:48.400]  That is more of the thing I should be doing.
[12:48.400 --> 12:50.720]  So we've got Dave doing some auctions for us.
[12:50.720 --> 12:58.920]  So discord and Cannabuzz are social media platforms where ieregenetic seeds may be available
[12:58.920 --> 13:01.880]  on rare, if not often occasions.
[13:01.880 --> 13:03.120]  So make sure you check those out.
[13:03.120 --> 13:05.320]  I'm going to recap the list for you one more time.
[13:05.320 --> 13:08.400]  Then we're going to get into a couple of grow questions.
[13:08.400 --> 13:15.720]  ieregeneticsherenow.com, dankseed.store, heritage seed bank, golden ticket seed bank,
[13:15.720 --> 13:21.360]  elfuego seeds, hype seeds, and then follow that up with discord and Cannabuzz.
[13:21.360 --> 13:25.620]  Most importantly, check out my website, ieregenetics.com.
[13:25.620 --> 13:28.840]  Then sign up for the mail chimp updates.
[13:28.840 --> 13:29.960]  Never miss an update.
[13:29.960 --> 13:32.520]  You'll get a couple of cool coupon codes.
[13:32.520 --> 13:34.340]  That's all I think I've got for that part.
[13:34.340 --> 13:35.340]  Let's move forward.
[13:35.340 --> 13:37.600]  I do have a couple of great grow questions for you.
[13:37.600 --> 13:39.320]  Let's see how far we can get.
[13:39.320 --> 13:40.920]  This one came from our friend.
[13:40.920 --> 13:42.720]  They want their name said.
[13:42.720 --> 13:45.300]  Yes, they want me to use the name Carl.
[13:45.300 --> 13:49.920]  This one came from the grow help tab on the ieregenetics website.
[13:49.920 --> 13:53.480]  Let's see how much of this I need to read to get us up to speed.
[13:53.480 --> 13:55.200]  The question is, what strains are you growing?
[13:55.200 --> 13:59.140]  They're growing Bruce Banner, Gorilla Glue number four, Girl Scout cookies, and White
[13:59.140 --> 14:00.480]  Widow to Big Bud.
[14:00.480 --> 14:01.480]  That's an old school lineup.
[14:01.480 --> 14:02.480]  Kind of cool.
[14:02.480 --> 14:04.200]  They're growing indoors under LEDs.
[14:04.200 --> 14:05.200]  They're in flower.
[14:05.200 --> 14:07.200]  They're in week five growing in soil.
[14:07.200 --> 14:09.480]  The last feed was a plain water flush.
[14:09.480 --> 14:11.080]  We'll read more about that in a moment.
[14:11.080 --> 14:12.400]  The pH was six five.
[14:12.400 --> 14:14.520]  Daytime, nighttime temps are cool.
[14:14.520 --> 14:15.640]  Humidity is cool.
[14:15.640 --> 14:16.720]  Here is the problem.
[14:16.720 --> 14:19.040]  We have a description of the problem.
[14:19.040 --> 14:21.400]  Let's see what's going on in my buddy Carl's grow.
[14:21.400 --> 14:23.000]  Now one weird thing you're going to have to bear with me.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.600]  My printer didn't print this in a long column.
[14:25.600 --> 14:27.920]  It printed it two pages side by side.
[14:27.920 --> 14:31.440]  So I have to hold the two pages side by side like a book to make this work.
[14:31.440 --> 14:37.480]  So if I look like a complete weirdo on the camera, if I stutter a lot extra, it's because
[14:37.480 --> 14:39.520]  the way the printer printed this.
[14:39.520 --> 14:41.720]  But I promise you we're going to get through this.
[14:41.720 --> 14:43.860]  This is the least of our problems today.
[14:43.860 --> 14:46.640]  If this is the biggest problem we face, things will be just fine.
[14:46.640 --> 14:48.200]  I'm going to move into this.
[14:48.200 --> 14:49.200]  Here we go.
[14:49.200 --> 14:54.360]  It says my medium is 50 50 cocoa fox farm soil with some perlite.
[14:54.360 --> 14:57.600]  So I'm going to say 40 40 20 maybe something like that.
[14:57.600 --> 14:58.600]  45 45.
[14:58.600 --> 14:59.600]  Because you got it.
[14:59.600 --> 15:00.600]  So I'm going to say 40 40 20 maybe something like that.
[15:00.600 --> 15:01.600]  45 50 50 and some perlite.
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.480]  A percentage of that is perlite.
[15:03.480 --> 15:04.600]  Anyway, I digress.
[15:04.600 --> 15:08.440]  A few weeks ago, my cheap pH pin gave me incorrect readings.
[15:08.440 --> 15:13.280]  So I unknowingly fed my plants at a much lower pH than intended.
[15:13.280 --> 15:17.600]  I'm not sure what it exactly was because my pH pins were off.
[15:17.600 --> 15:20.120]  OK, that's a good spot to start.
[15:20.120 --> 15:21.200]  They started showing slight.
[15:21.200 --> 15:26.200]  The plants started showing slight deficiencies or possibly lockout with the top leaves of
[15:26.200 --> 15:29.440]  the plants beginning to yellow and get brown spots.
[15:30.280 --> 15:31.280]  I realized this.
[15:31.280 --> 15:37.000]  I flushed with water pH around six point five and the runoff came out at four point two.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.960]  Now you said you flushed with water pH about six point five.
[15:40.960 --> 15:41.960]  What was it?
[15:41.960 --> 15:43.960]  My pH meter doesn't show me any ranges.
[15:43.960 --> 15:46.760]  My pH meter shows me a definite number.
[15:46.760 --> 15:51.280]  It was either six to six, three, six, four, six, five.
[15:51.280 --> 15:54.600]  My my meter doesn't ever show me ranges.
[15:54.600 --> 15:57.240]  So details, details, details.
[15:57.240 --> 15:58.240]  It goes on.
[15:58.280 --> 16:02.640]  I gave what I thought was an adequate amount of water to flush, but I did not check the
[16:02.640 --> 16:03.640]  runoff again.
[16:03.640 --> 16:08.160]  So you flushed out what you thought was enough to flush again.
[16:08.160 --> 16:14.160]  Two to three days later, I gave a light feeding of general hydroponics, three part flora series
[16:14.160 --> 16:19.900]  plus cow mag, giving about 50 percent of the recommended chart for that time of flower.
[16:19.900 --> 16:23.680]  The problems persisted and got slightly worse.
[16:23.680 --> 16:26.000]  At this point, I think you flushed out all the nutrients.
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.040]  There's nothing for the plant to eat and now it's just hungry and you only gave it
[16:29.040 --> 16:30.040]  half of a meal.
[16:30.040 --> 16:32.800]  So it only got half of a meal.
[16:32.800 --> 16:34.920]  Just two days ago now I gave another flush.
[16:34.920 --> 16:39.280]  Now you're just making it more hungry, starting at six, five and eventually going up to seven
[16:39.280 --> 16:40.280]  point.
[16:40.280 --> 16:41.280]  Oh, why are you moving up?
[16:41.280 --> 16:46.440]  Pick a pH around between six, three and six, four, maybe six, five at the highest.
[16:46.440 --> 16:48.960]  I'd say six, four and stick with it.
[16:48.960 --> 16:51.560]  Consistency is going to help you out a lot here.
[16:51.560 --> 16:53.200]  Right now your plants were kind of angry.
[16:53.200 --> 16:56.520]  You had one problem and now you're giving them a lot more.
[16:56.520 --> 16:57.520]  Let's quit fucking with them.
[16:57.520 --> 16:59.580]  Let's give them some consistency.
[16:59.580 --> 17:00.700]  Let's show them the way.
[17:00.700 --> 17:03.000]  Let's get them out of the struggle with some consistency.
[17:03.000 --> 17:04.560]  I've said the word consistency a lot.
[17:04.560 --> 17:08.240]  Take a dab every time I say consistency now.
[17:08.240 --> 17:11.040]  So you fed them six, five, eventually going up to seven.
[17:11.040 --> 17:12.800]  I don't know why you're changing the pH.
[17:12.800 --> 17:17.800]  Pick one, stick with it because the runoff was barely climbing.
[17:17.800 --> 17:19.720]  Okay, maybe that makes sense.
[17:19.720 --> 17:25.720]  One plant, the white widow got a runoff of 4.8 and the Bruce banner got up to 5.1.
[17:25.720 --> 17:29.480]  The weirdest thing is the Girl Scout Cookies is the only one that is unaffected and looks
[17:29.480 --> 17:30.480]  beautiful.
[17:30.480 --> 17:33.640]  That's really funny because usually that Girl Scout Cookies is a real bitch.
[17:33.640 --> 17:37.340]  It's beautiful and healthy while it's gotten the same treatment as every other plant other
[17:37.340 --> 17:39.840]  than this most recent day flush.
[17:39.840 --> 17:44.560]  I did not flush her as it looks healthy and I just gave her a regular feeding schedule.
[17:44.560 --> 17:46.360]  All right, there is more.
[17:46.360 --> 17:49.840]  It says, I do believe I still need to flush again.
[17:49.840 --> 17:54.640]  I've been told to get the runoff at least within 1.0 of my feed.
[17:54.640 --> 17:59.440]  So if I'm feeding 6.5, the runoff is 5.5 or higher.
[17:59.440 --> 18:03.480]  My question to that is why are you growing runoff?
[18:03.480 --> 18:07.720]  Are you growing trays and meters or are you growing healthy cannabis plants?
[18:07.720 --> 18:10.480]  So I want to know why you need the runoff within a certain spot.
[18:10.480 --> 18:13.240]  It does make sense, but I want to know why it needs to be there.
[18:13.240 --> 18:14.860]  What's your science is behind that.
[18:14.860 --> 18:17.140]  Is what you've been told, is there a reason for it?
[18:17.140 --> 18:20.720]  Is it just like Rasta Jeff said that purple plants are the best?
[18:20.720 --> 18:22.260]  That's what the rule is.
[18:22.260 --> 18:24.780]  I would do some thinking, some research into that.
[18:24.780 --> 18:26.420]  So where are we?
[18:26.420 --> 18:30.140]  It's hard to read this fucking page because the way that it's printed or higher.
[18:30.140 --> 18:33.860]  I just want to make sure that it's still what I need to do and that I'm doing it right.
[18:33.860 --> 18:38.220]  Should I have up the pH of the water I'm flushing with to increase the runoff faster or just
[18:38.220 --> 18:40.260]  pass more water through it?
[18:40.260 --> 18:44.660]  And once I have the runoff where I finally need it, can I immediately finish off the
[18:44.660 --> 18:46.060]  flush with a light feeding?
[18:46.060 --> 18:49.820]  I feel like these plants have gotten flushed so much recently they might be needing some
[18:49.820 --> 18:50.820]  nutrients.
[18:50.820 --> 18:54.320]  I am pretty certain that you have got an empty rhizosphere.
[18:54.320 --> 18:55.380]  The plate is empty.
[18:55.380 --> 18:57.980]  The bowl is empty and these plants want some food.
[18:57.980 --> 19:01.380]  I think you've just cleaned the plate, cleaned out the medium.
[19:01.380 --> 19:02.380]  There's nothing in there.
[19:02.380 --> 19:03.660]  That cocoa doesn't hold a lot.
[19:03.660 --> 19:04.940]  You got 50% cocoa.
[19:04.940 --> 19:07.600]  That soilless mix wasn't going to hold a lot for you.
[19:07.600 --> 19:10.000]  So you probably need some nutrients in there quite soon.
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.160]  It says, I'm sure you get this a lot, but I really love your podcast, man.
[19:13.160 --> 19:16.960]  You're a straight shooting dude with a big heart and you're super easy to listen to.
[19:16.960 --> 19:17.960]  Thank you.
[19:17.960 --> 19:18.960]  Those are great compliments.
[19:18.960 --> 19:19.960]  I appreciate that.
[19:19.960 --> 19:21.300]  Lots of good shit in there.
[19:21.300 --> 19:24.400]  Good dude, straight shooting, big heart, easy to listen to.
[19:24.400 --> 19:25.400]  Thank you.
[19:25.400 --> 19:26.400]  It says, keep up the great work, man.
[19:26.400 --> 19:31.600]  I hope to get my hands on some good IRE genetics for my next run or maybe in the summer.
[19:31.600 --> 19:34.920]  My friend, I just gave you a nice list of places to get those genetics.
[19:34.920 --> 19:38.800]  So I do hope you're able to get some IRE genetics in your garden for the summer.
[19:38.800 --> 19:39.900]  It is springtime.
[19:39.900 --> 19:41.220]  It's time to do the shopping now.
[19:41.220 --> 19:42.500]  Get those seeds popped.
[19:42.500 --> 19:43.500]  Get your plants grown up.
[19:43.500 --> 19:44.500]  Get them cloned.
[19:44.500 --> 19:45.500]  Get them sexed.
[19:45.500 --> 19:46.500]  Find out if you got boys or girls.
[19:46.500 --> 19:47.500]  Start vegging them out.
[19:47.500 --> 19:50.800]  Get them shaped and get that outdoor prepared ASAP.
[19:50.800 --> 19:52.880]  Anyway, let's talk about this.
[19:52.880 --> 19:58.400]  These plants, these plants have been through the fucking ringer.
[19:58.400 --> 19:59.840]  They had some issues.
[19:59.840 --> 20:01.360]  Your pH meter was wrong.
[20:01.360 --> 20:02.600]  You flushed the shit out of them.
[20:02.600 --> 20:03.600]  You kind of fed them.
[20:03.600 --> 20:05.120]  You flushed them again.
[20:05.120 --> 20:06.360]  These plants are stressed out.
[20:06.360 --> 20:07.440]  They're in shock.
[20:07.440 --> 20:10.600]  Right now, they probably just want a solid feeding.
[20:10.600 --> 20:13.400]  Do what I call a triage.
[20:13.400 --> 20:18.160]  A lot of times when a bunch of dudes are looking at a car and the car has got a little problem,
[20:18.160 --> 20:22.120]  it drives me crazy when it's like eight dudes just going, ah, it could be the muffler bearing.
[20:22.120 --> 20:24.800]  I think it's the washer fluid.
[20:24.800 --> 20:26.360]  Are you a mechanic?
[20:26.360 --> 20:30.820]  Today you can hook up a little machine to your car and it'll say it's the alternator.
[20:30.820 --> 20:31.880]  It's that easy.
[20:32.440 --> 20:33.960]  We don't have that machine for our plants.
[20:33.960 --> 20:37.160]  I think we look fucking silly standing around going, I think it's a pH issue.
[20:37.160 --> 20:39.300]  I think it's cow mag.
[20:39.300 --> 20:40.660]  Sometimes we can identify it.
[20:40.660 --> 20:42.160]  Sometimes it's multiple issues.
[20:42.160 --> 20:44.400]  Sometimes it's an environmental issue.
[20:44.400 --> 20:48.880]  Sometimes why are we going to sit here and try to figure it out when we can fix it?
[20:48.880 --> 20:53.560]  All you got to do is triage these plants and do simple basic rescue techniques and get
[20:53.560 --> 20:54.640]  them back on track.
[20:54.640 --> 20:55.880]  We've been fucking with them.
[20:55.880 --> 20:56.880]  They're stressed out.
[20:56.880 --> 20:57.880]  They've been flushed.
[20:57.880 --> 20:58.880]  They've been fed.
[20:58.880 --> 20:59.880]  They've been reflushed.
[20:59.880 --> 21:01.020]  They're kind of having a panic attack.
[21:01.160 --> 21:02.160]  They want a solid meal.
[21:02.160 --> 21:05.700]  Once we feed them, they're going to settle back down and get into their routine.
[21:05.700 --> 21:08.300]  So let's do what I call the triage.
[21:08.300 --> 21:12.160]  If I go into your grow and the plants look like shit and we can't figure out why just
[21:12.160 --> 21:15.020]  by looking, maybe it's a cow mag issue.
[21:15.020 --> 21:16.160]  Maybe you've been overfeeding.
[21:16.160 --> 21:17.240]  Maybe it's a pH issue.
[21:17.240 --> 21:20.380]  Maybe it's all of the above and it just looks like shit in general.
[21:20.380 --> 21:24.140]  Let's do a few things to correct the room and the plants right away.
[21:24.140 --> 21:25.520]  I call it the triage.
[21:25.520 --> 21:27.260]  I call it the general health checkup.
[21:27.260 --> 21:28.500]  You can call it a lot of things.
[21:29.100 --> 21:34.540]  First of all, and in your condition, we already know that this is pH, but in most environments,
[21:34.540 --> 21:37.420]  most situations, I would say, how is the room?
[21:37.420 --> 21:38.700]  Do we have any light leaks?
[21:38.700 --> 21:40.060]  How's the VPD?
[21:40.060 --> 21:41.860]  How's the temperature of the water?
[21:41.860 --> 21:42.860]  Look for stuff like that.
[21:42.860 --> 21:44.220]  Obvious signs around the room.
[21:44.220 --> 21:45.920]  We've corrected all of that.
[21:45.920 --> 21:46.920]  Correct all the basics.
[21:46.920 --> 21:48.840]  Then let's look at the plant health.
[21:48.840 --> 21:49.840]  Is the plant living?
[21:49.840 --> 21:51.120]  Is it going to die immediately?
[21:51.120 --> 21:53.100]  If not, we can triage it slowly.
[21:53.100 --> 21:56.900]  If it's got major issues, we may have to go into critical condition and do some major
[21:56.900 --> 21:57.900]  work.
[21:58.300 --> 22:01.980]  Start maybe by removing any terrible looking leaves so the plant doesn't have to struggle
[22:01.980 --> 22:04.180]  with those terrible looking leaves.
[22:04.180 --> 22:07.300]  Then let's feed the plant.
[22:07.300 --> 22:08.300]  Let me back up.
[22:08.300 --> 22:09.700]  Before we feed it, let's flush it.
[22:09.700 --> 22:13.600]  You've already done that, so I tried to skip this step, but let's flush the plant.
[22:13.600 --> 22:15.920]  That soil, I don't know what you've been feeding it.
[22:15.920 --> 22:19.540]  I know in this case, but I'm saying hypothetically, if I'm coming into a fucked up garden, I don't
[22:19.540 --> 22:20.540]  know what you've been feeding.
[22:20.540 --> 22:21.540]  I don't know what's been going on.
[22:21.540 --> 22:23.320]  I don't know what's happening in that root zone.
[22:23.320 --> 22:24.460]  We can do a runoff test.
[22:24.460 --> 22:25.740]  We can do all kinds of stuff.
[22:26.460 --> 22:29.100]  Whatever that runoff test says, I'm still going to flush.
[22:29.100 --> 22:31.140]  I'm going to give it one good flush.
[22:31.140 --> 22:35.620]  I don't mean like a ridiculous excessive runoff flush.
[22:35.620 --> 22:40.060]  I want about 10 to 25% runoff on this initial flush.
[22:40.060 --> 22:44.340]  I'm basically resetting that rhizosphere, resetting the media to where all the stuff
[22:44.340 --> 22:47.820]  you fed it, all the shit you locked it up with is now rinsed out.
[22:47.820 --> 22:48.820]  It's gone.
[22:48.820 --> 22:49.820]  I've got a blank canvas.
[22:49.820 --> 22:50.820]  A blank canvas.
[22:50.820 --> 22:52.820]  Sorry, I tried to sneeze as I said that.
[22:52.820 --> 22:54.540]  All right, I think I'm back on track.
[22:54.540 --> 22:56.420]  I apologize for the sniffle under the microphone.
[22:56.420 --> 22:59.140]  That was fucking rude and unprofessional and I know better.
[22:59.140 --> 23:00.140]  Not going to edit that.
[23:00.140 --> 23:03.140]  Anyway, we've got a blank canvas to begin with.
[23:03.140 --> 23:05.620]  Now this is where I would do a triage feeding.
[23:05.620 --> 23:09.380]  This is where I would mix up just a good solid basic feed.
[23:09.380 --> 23:11.980]  In my basic mix, there would be base nutrients.
[23:11.980 --> 23:13.740]  Are we in veg or are we in flour?
[23:13.740 --> 23:15.660]  Get your veg or flour bottle.
[23:15.660 --> 23:17.260]  Put the appropriate amount of that in there.
[23:17.260 --> 23:19.540]  What were you using before shit went wrong?
[23:19.540 --> 23:22.580]  What were you using on a good successful run?
[23:22.620 --> 23:25.940]  If you give me a bottle and I don't know the brand, I'm probably going to use about 50
[23:25.940 --> 23:29.740]  to 75% of those base nutrients in my mix.
[23:29.740 --> 23:34.420]  If it says 100, I'm going to put 50 to 75 in there based on the plant health and the
[23:34.420 --> 23:35.420]  products.
[23:35.420 --> 23:38.340]  I'm going to read a little bit and make an educated decision.
[23:38.340 --> 23:40.060]  Let's start off with the base nutrient.
[23:40.060 --> 23:41.740]  Then we need some CalMag.
[23:41.740 --> 23:44.500]  I know that calcium and magnesium are two different nutrients.
[23:44.500 --> 23:49.220]  You guys quit saying that it's CalMag deficient, but most of the time they're sold in one bottle
[23:49.220 --> 23:50.740]  so I will say CalMag.
[23:50.780 --> 23:52.900]  I know I'm contradicting myself.
[23:52.900 --> 23:54.420]  Let's mix in a little bit of CalMag.
[23:54.420 --> 23:56.540]  The CalMag bottle will be very helpful.
[23:56.540 --> 24:00.620]  Then, also, maybe give it a little bit of fulvic acid.
[24:00.620 --> 24:02.680]  If you've got some fulvic, that'll help you out.
[24:02.680 --> 24:06.440]  If you've got something like some kelp products, that may help you out.
[24:06.440 --> 24:08.900]  Maybe some microbes will help you out if you've got some recharge.
[24:08.900 --> 24:10.500]  We've got base nutrients.
[24:10.500 --> 24:11.500]  We've got CalMag.
[24:11.500 --> 24:12.500]  We've got fulvic acid.
[24:12.500 --> 24:14.420]  Got a little bit of kelp in there.
[24:14.420 --> 24:17.340]  Now we've got a little bit of recharge in there just for general health.
[24:17.340 --> 24:20.540]  Let's pH adjust this to about 6.4.
[24:20.540 --> 24:21.540]  I'd say 6.4.
[24:21.540 --> 24:22.540]  I said about.
[24:22.540 --> 24:23.540]  Let's do it.
[24:23.540 --> 24:24.540]  6.4.
[24:24.540 --> 24:25.540]  Let's not fuck around.
[24:25.540 --> 24:28.860]  Let's feed the plant this general health mix until we get a little bit of runoff.
[24:28.860 --> 24:31.260]  10, 15, maybe 20%.
[24:31.260 --> 24:35.240]  Now we know that soil is saturated with good nutrients at a good pH.
[24:35.240 --> 24:37.780]  You can test that runoff if you want to.
[24:37.780 --> 24:41.780]  My question is, are we growing runoff or are we growing plants?
[24:41.780 --> 24:42.780]  I like the runoff.
[24:42.780 --> 24:43.780]  I like the meters.
[24:43.780 --> 24:47.160]  I like the tests, but I'm going to watch the plant over the next couple of days and see
[24:47.160 --> 24:49.820]  how it responds to the feeding that we just gave it.
[24:50.100 --> 24:54.540]  I think that corrected pH and those proper nutrients are going to rescue that plant.
[24:54.540 --> 24:57.660]  Your rhizosphere, your root zone is in constant flux.
[24:57.660 --> 25:00.260]  The minute the water hits it, the pH changes.
[25:00.260 --> 25:05.380]  The minute that water starts evaporating and drying out, the pH changes.
[25:05.380 --> 25:09.860]  Every few minutes as it gets a touch drier in certain areas of that rhizosphere, the
[25:09.860 --> 25:11.180]  pH is changing.
[25:11.180 --> 25:13.540]  So we can't chase that pH constantly.
[25:13.540 --> 25:14.780]  Let's pay attention to the plants.
[25:14.780 --> 25:15.780]  Let's get them happy.
[25:15.780 --> 25:18.380]  Let's get them fed and get them back on track.
[25:18.380 --> 25:21.180]  Let's defoliate any shitty shit that might be on there.
[25:21.180 --> 25:25.180]  Let's cut off any funky branches that may be wasting space and energy and get the plant
[25:25.180 --> 25:26.460]  back on track.
[25:26.460 --> 25:30.980]  So you flushed, then you flushed again, then you fed them halfway.
[25:30.980 --> 25:33.340]  I think they're still hungry and frustrated.
[25:33.340 --> 25:37.660]  Let's mix up a good feed and feed them a nice, perfect meal.
[25:37.660 --> 25:40.920]  Sometimes a sick plant just wants a good, solid, healthy feeding.
[25:40.920 --> 25:44.780]  So let's pay attention to the plants after that and not pay so much attention to the
[25:44.780 --> 25:49.300]  meters because the meters are what got you here in the first place.
[25:49.300 --> 25:50.940]  I love all of the equipment.
[25:50.940 --> 25:52.540]  I love all of the toys.
[25:52.540 --> 25:57.700]  I love to use all of that stuff to my advantage, but sometimes we've got to watch the plants
[25:57.700 --> 26:01.220]  and we've got to remember that the plants are the boss.
[26:01.220 --> 26:04.020]  We're not growing, I keep saying it, we're not growing pH meters.
[26:04.020 --> 26:05.740]  We're not growing runoff water.
[26:05.740 --> 26:08.160]  We're not growing minder units or pulse units.
[26:08.160 --> 26:09.340]  We're growing cannabis plants.
[26:09.340 --> 26:12.100]  So pay attention to those plants.
[26:12.140 --> 26:18.100]  I was growing awesome herb before I had all of this technology and sometimes I wonder
[26:18.100 --> 26:23.860]  if this technology is messing up my ability to grow because I catch myself checking data
[26:23.860 --> 26:26.940]  logs, VPD logs.
[26:26.940 --> 26:28.620]  I should be looking at the plants.
[26:28.620 --> 26:30.340]  Anyway, I digress.
[26:30.340 --> 26:31.340]  You get the point.
[26:31.340 --> 26:33.500]  The point is the plants are the boss.
[26:33.500 --> 26:34.500]  Pay attention to those plants.
[26:34.500 --> 26:35.740]  Give them a nice, solid feed.
[26:35.740 --> 26:37.020]  I don't think you need to keep flushing.
[26:37.020 --> 26:39.620]  I think flushing has been done.
[26:39.620 --> 26:40.620]  That's been done.
[26:40.620 --> 26:41.620]  What are you going to do?
[26:42.140 --> 26:43.660]  You're not going to keep flushing them, starve them to death until they're all yellow and
[26:43.660 --> 26:44.980]  completely fucked up.
[26:44.980 --> 26:47.220]  Let's give them a nice, solid feed.
[26:47.220 --> 26:48.820]  Pay attention to that feed.
[26:48.820 --> 26:51.500]  If it looks like they're taking it, feed them again the same way.
[26:51.500 --> 26:55.540]  If it looks like something is not working, let's adjust our feed accordingly.
[26:55.540 --> 26:59.220]  I think you were giving it a little bit high pH and you had a pH range.
[26:59.220 --> 27:02.900]  Let's get a pH spot, write it down and do that every day.
[27:02.900 --> 27:05.640]  When you feed it your triage mix, write that down.
[27:05.640 --> 27:08.040]  Write down how many mils of each bottle you put in.
[27:08.040 --> 27:11.380]  Write down what the EC or PPM of the feed is before you feed it.
[27:12.140 --> 27:13.140]  Write down the pH.
[27:13.140 --> 27:14.460]  If you want to, do the test coming out.
[27:14.460 --> 27:17.100]  See what happens when you feed it coming out.
[27:17.100 --> 27:19.340]  Keep doing that for the next couple of feeds.
[27:19.340 --> 27:22.780]  Then if you need to email me again, send me some pictures, let me know what's going on.
[27:22.780 --> 27:24.140]  We can adjust from there.
[27:24.140 --> 27:28.860]  But I think after a couple of feeds, these plants will rebound and everything will be
[27:28.860 --> 27:30.940]  right back on track.
[27:30.940 --> 27:31.940]  Let's see where you are.
[27:31.940 --> 27:32.940]  I think you're in the flowering phase.
[27:32.940 --> 27:34.380]  You're in week five.
[27:34.380 --> 27:36.500]  You've only got four to five weeks to go.
[27:36.500 --> 27:39.180]  You're going to start flushing in two weeks anyway.
[27:39.180 --> 27:40.980]  Hopefully you got these plants back on track.
[27:41.580 --> 27:43.020]  Hopefully you got a big fat harvest.
[27:43.020 --> 27:44.860]  Hopefully we get an update from you.
[27:44.860 --> 27:46.540]  Hopefully you have great success.
[27:46.540 --> 27:49.700]  And also, hopefully this was a learning lesson.
[27:49.700 --> 27:52.520]  Let's not rely too much on all of that equipment.
[27:52.520 --> 27:58.140]  Let's pay more attention to the plants and less attention to the toys and equipment.
[27:58.140 --> 27:59.780]  All right.
[27:59.780 --> 28:01.780]  I'm going to jump into one more question here.
[28:01.780 --> 28:05.120]  I think we can cover this one up before this podcast gets too long.
[28:05.120 --> 28:06.300]  This one comes from our friend.
[28:06.300 --> 28:08.260]  He wants to be called Fox.
[28:08.260 --> 28:10.620]  This again came from the Grow Help tab on the website.
[28:10.620 --> 28:14.220]  I'm going to take a quick sip here before we continue so you don't have to keep listening
[28:14.220 --> 28:15.580]  to my voice crackle.
[28:15.580 --> 28:21.790]  Pardon me for one moment.
[28:21.790 --> 28:24.630]  Oh, that is delightful.
[28:24.630 --> 28:29.590]  Once again, I'm sipping on some pineapple and coconut juice.
[28:29.590 --> 28:30.590]  That is so good.
[28:30.590 --> 28:31.590]  Anyway, you're not here to...
[28:31.590 --> 28:32.890]  This is not Juice with Jeff.
[28:32.890 --> 28:35.270]  This is the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[28:35.270 --> 28:38.350]  Let's talk about my friend Fox and his grow.
[28:38.350 --> 28:41.270]  Fox is growing Underdog OG from TH Seeds.
[28:41.590 --> 28:43.470]  Shout out to my buddy Adam Dunn in TH Seeds.
[28:43.470 --> 28:44.470]  Hope you guys are well.
[28:44.470 --> 28:46.390]  It's being grown indoors under an LED.
[28:46.390 --> 28:48.390]  It is in veg.
[28:48.390 --> 28:49.950]  This is still in the seedling stage.
[28:49.950 --> 28:52.830]  Previously, we've done a podcast talking about stages.
[28:52.830 --> 28:54.710]  This is officially the seedling stage right now.
[28:54.710 --> 28:59.750]  I think you're about a couple more, maybe like a few days, a week away from actually
[28:59.750 --> 29:00.750]  saying this may be veg.
[29:00.750 --> 29:03.270]  I will include a picture somewhere in the video.
[29:03.270 --> 29:05.910]  It goes, last feed.
[29:05.910 --> 29:06.910]  Let me catch up to where I was.
[29:06.910 --> 29:08.230]  Veg, that's where we are.
[29:08.230 --> 29:09.230]  What week?
[29:09.230 --> 29:10.230]  Not even in a week yet.
[29:10.230 --> 29:12.030]  The problem, living soil.
[29:12.030 --> 29:15.110]  Last feed, about four ounces of recharge.
[29:15.110 --> 29:18.710]  That little plant didn't need four ounces of recharge, but that's okay.
[29:18.710 --> 29:19.710]  The temps are okay.
[29:19.710 --> 29:21.390]  The humidity is okay.
[29:21.390 --> 29:23.390]  Here is the question, the problem.
[29:23.390 --> 29:24.390]  What's up, Ross to Jeff?
[29:24.390 --> 29:25.390]  I hope everything is iry.
[29:25.390 --> 29:32.310]  I don't necessarily have a problem, but my question is, is this normal node spacing?
[29:32.310 --> 29:36.030]  If you look at the picture, it's a little tiny plant that's a little bit stretched,
[29:36.030 --> 29:40.910]  which doesn't have enough development to have what I would call node spacing.
[29:40.910 --> 29:44.850]  The space between these little starter leaves, that first set of leaves, that second little
[29:44.850 --> 29:48.910]  set of growth, and then what's coming out, that is beautiful spacing, but you are barely
[29:48.910 --> 29:50.690]  getting taken off right now.
[29:50.690 --> 29:56.450]  The thing I would recommend, the thing I noticed most that I want to comment on is the leggy
[29:56.450 --> 30:00.830]  length between the cup and the start of the growth.
[30:00.830 --> 30:05.190]  This is what I would call a very leggy, stretchy seedling.
[30:05.350 --> 30:09.670]  This seedling is telling me that it wants more light and that it wants a fan.
[30:09.670 --> 30:14.190]  I'm going to assume, let's read more because I do see answers to my questions because I've
[30:14.190 --> 30:17.010]  got questions too.
[30:17.010 --> 30:19.230]  Is the node spacing normal or is this too close?
[30:19.230 --> 30:24.010]  I ask because I watch a lot of videos on YouTube and their plants always look a lot taller
[30:24.010 --> 30:30.150]  than mine, but at the same amount of nodes relatively to the day.
[30:30.150 --> 30:36.590]  I have a 50 watt do it yourself house LED bulbs with a plastic cut off and then he explains
[30:36.590 --> 30:37.590]  the bulbs a little bit.
[30:37.590 --> 30:39.470]  I got them on Amazon.
[30:39.470 --> 30:43.070]  All of my plants veg like this and I don't know if maybe the lights are too close.
[30:43.070 --> 30:46.730]  They're about 20 inches off the floor, about 12 inches away from the top of the plant,
[30:46.730 --> 30:49.870]  or is it too much light for the 18 by 18 veg box?
[30:49.870 --> 30:51.310]  Thanks in advance if you get this one.
[30:51.310 --> 30:52.310]  I got this one, bro.
[30:52.310 --> 30:53.310]  You're very welcome.
[30:53.310 --> 30:58.390]  The pen is to give reference of the space between nodes, peace and much love.
[30:58.390 --> 30:59.390]  Where's the pen?
[30:59.630 --> 31:00.630]  Is there a pen in here?
[31:00.630 --> 31:01.630]  It might've been another picture.
[31:01.630 --> 31:04.630]  Is that a pen in the background?
[31:04.630 --> 31:05.750]  Where's the pen dude?
[31:05.750 --> 31:07.470]  Anyway, let's not focus on the pen.
[31:07.470 --> 31:10.590]  That's not here in the picture.
[31:10.590 --> 31:13.790]  I honestly think that the plant looks okay.
[31:13.790 --> 31:15.350]  It looks basically fine.
[31:15.350 --> 31:16.990]  It shouldn't be that tall.
[31:16.990 --> 31:19.270]  Oh, excuse me for being that tall.
[31:19.270 --> 31:21.090]  That plant doesn't have enough growth.
[31:21.090 --> 31:24.630]  The growth should be coming out of the top of the plant and your growth is coming from
[31:24.630 --> 31:26.270]  the bottom of your plant.
[31:26.270 --> 31:29.310]  That's why you got that long, really long branch.
[31:29.310 --> 31:33.270]  That thing's probably six or eight inches long it looks like, and then you get your
[31:33.270 --> 31:36.230]  little sprout and then you got a little bit of growth coming out of it.
[31:36.230 --> 31:39.550]  I think you could possibly get that light a little bit closer.
[31:39.550 --> 31:42.810]  If they start drooping during the day, then you're getting enough light.
[31:42.810 --> 31:43.810]  You can raise it up.
[31:43.810 --> 31:47.310]  If they start looking crispy or getting a little bit dry, you can raise it up.
[31:47.310 --> 31:51.850]  But by the skinniness of that stock and the lack of growth in that plant, I would say
[31:51.850 --> 31:54.930]  that it probably wants a little bit more light.
[31:54.930 --> 31:58.650]  Then something I would recommend just to make it grow a little bit more stout and a little
[31:58.650 --> 32:01.290]  bit more hardy, I would put a fan on that thing.
[32:01.290 --> 32:07.130]  If you blew some breeze on it, it would probably make that stick a little bit more robust.
[32:07.130 --> 32:09.330]  It would give it a little more ... It'd be thicker.
[32:09.330 --> 32:11.010]  It'd give it more girth.
[32:11.010 --> 32:12.730]  It'd be just bigger and stronger.
[32:12.730 --> 32:15.050]  A little bit of wind, it's going to learn to fight that wind.
[32:15.050 --> 32:16.730]  It's going to learn just to stay up in the wind.
[32:16.730 --> 32:20.570]  It'll be stronger, thicker, just a bigger, fatter plant.
[32:20.570 --> 32:23.010]  I don't think the light is too far away.
[32:23.010 --> 32:27.170]  I don't think the light ... I think it wants more light, basically.
[32:27.170 --> 32:28.570]  That is the bottom line here.
[32:28.570 --> 32:32.350]  That plant just wants more light altogether.
[32:32.350 --> 32:35.370]  Your veg space wants more light overall, in my opinion.
[32:35.370 --> 32:37.490]  If you can add more light, I would add more.
[32:37.490 --> 32:42.570]  If you can't add more, this is going to work, but you're going to have stretchy plants.
[32:42.570 --> 32:46.330]  You'll notice if you increase the light, the plants will stay short and they'll get branchy
[32:46.330 --> 32:47.890]  and bushy.
[32:47.890 --> 32:52.170]  These are going to get tall and skinny and you won't see a lot of branching.
[32:52.170 --> 32:53.170]  Excuse me for that.
[32:53.170 --> 32:55.170]  I had to move the microphone away for that one.
[32:55.170 --> 32:56.490]  Let's just keep moving here.
[32:56.490 --> 32:59.490]  Anyway, to my friend ... Let's see what you said your name was, because I've got your
[32:59.490 --> 33:00.490]  real name on the screen.
[33:00.490 --> 33:04.210]  To my friend Fox, basically I would recommend more light.
[33:04.210 --> 33:10.090]  You've got a 2700 Kelvin, a 5000 Kelvin.
[33:10.090 --> 33:11.690]  You basically need more light in there.
[33:11.690 --> 33:14.090]  I would just add more light.
[33:14.090 --> 33:17.170]  If you can get an LED or something that's a little bit bigger, a little bit brighter,
[33:17.450 --> 33:18.450]  I might do that.
[33:18.450 --> 33:23.010]  It's going to grow just fine with this, but it could grow even better with the appropriate
[33:23.010 --> 33:24.010]  light.
[33:24.010 --> 33:25.010]  I keep repeating myself.
[33:25.010 --> 33:26.010]  I feel like I've answered your question.
[33:26.010 --> 33:28.050]  Thank you for the great question.
