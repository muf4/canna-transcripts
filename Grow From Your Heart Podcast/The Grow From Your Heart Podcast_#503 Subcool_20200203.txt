[00:00.000 --> 00:03.920]  What's up, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes.
[00:03.920 --> 00:08.080]  Grab your pipes, grab your bongs, pack up a fat bull, roll up a fat joint, because in
[00:08.080 --> 00:12.480]  this episode, we are going to celebrate the weed nerd.
[00:12.480 --> 00:15.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, I woke up to a text message from a close friend letting me know
[00:15.920 --> 00:20.880]  that one of my heroes, one of my idols, one of my mentors passed away this morning.
[00:20.880 --> 00:25.560]  Many of you will know who Subcool was, but if you're not sure, Subcool was a cannabis
[00:25.560 --> 00:30.920]  breeder, Subcool was a cannabis pioneer, Subcool was a cannabis educator and a cannabis
[00:30.920 --> 00:32.400]  activist.
[00:32.400 --> 00:36.840]  Subcool was the creator of very many popular strains.
[00:36.840 --> 00:41.880]  Subcool made Jack the Ripper, Subcool made Vortex, Subcool made Space Queen.
[00:41.880 --> 00:44.360]  Subcool was very well-known in the cannabis industry.
[00:44.360 --> 00:47.840]  He's got very many High Times Cannabis Cup awards.
[00:47.840 --> 00:50.800]  He's gotten a High Times Lifetime Achievement Award.
[00:50.800 --> 00:53.080]  He was also known as the weed nerd.
[00:53.080 --> 00:58.560]  Subcool was very influential in my cannabis career, my cannabis development, and heavily
[00:58.560 --> 01:01.520]  influential in my cannabis photography.
[01:01.520 --> 01:05.920]  If you look at his photography, then you look at the evolution of my photography, you can
[01:05.920 --> 01:09.960]  for sure see Subby's influence in my work.
[01:09.960 --> 01:11.800]  Subcool did a lot of things for our community.
[01:11.800 --> 01:15.320]  Another thing he was very well-known for was his Super Soil.
[01:15.320 --> 01:20.680]  Subcool has a great Super Soil recipe online that many people base their Super Soil recipes
[01:20.680 --> 01:23.060]  off of to this day.
[01:23.060 --> 01:28.100]  Subcool also did what was known as the School of Dank, where he would do a large seminar-type
[01:28.100 --> 01:31.660]  class where a lot of people would fly from around the world.
[01:31.660 --> 01:33.940]  Subcool would teach a multiple-day class.
[01:33.940 --> 01:38.860]  And then most of the time, the proceeds from those classes were donated to a charity.
[01:38.860 --> 01:43.620]  Many times it was to autism awareness and to raise funds for kids with autism.
[01:43.620 --> 01:47.880]  Subcool did a lot of great things, not just for the cannabis community, but for his regular
[01:47.880 --> 01:50.500]  community and the people around him.
[01:50.500 --> 01:54.700]  Obviously and unfortunately, Subcool has left the building.
[01:54.700 --> 01:56.780]  Subcool is no longer with us.
[01:56.780 --> 02:00.580]  Subcool had been battling a condition known as Alpha-1 for quite a while.
[02:00.580 --> 02:04.060]  If you follow him online, you know that he's been getting injections and medicine for quite
[02:04.060 --> 02:06.020]  a while to treat this condition.
[02:06.020 --> 02:10.700]  Unfortunately, his body finally gave out and he did not wake up this morning, so he went
[02:10.700 --> 02:12.660]  peacefully in his sleep.
[02:12.660 --> 02:14.620]  So hopefully that was quick and painless.
[02:14.620 --> 02:18.700]  I'm fucking heartbroken, but Subby wouldn't want me to sit here and cry about it.
[02:18.700 --> 02:21.620]  Subby would want me to smoke a fat joint.
[02:21.620 --> 02:23.580]  Subcool would want me to sprout some seeds.
[02:23.580 --> 02:27.660]  And then Subcool would want me to get back to business teaching you how to grow top shelf
[02:27.660 --> 02:28.660]  cannabis.
[02:28.660 --> 02:30.140]  So I'm going to press pause for a moment.
[02:30.140 --> 02:31.300]  I'm going to blow my nose.
[02:31.300 --> 02:33.820]  I'm going to take about 47 fat dabs.
[02:33.820 --> 02:38.740]  And then when I get back, I promise to deliver a top shelf podcast dedicated to my buddy
[02:38.740 --> 02:39.740]  Subcool.
[02:39.740 --> 02:41.980]  All right, I'm back through the magic of editing.
[02:41.980 --> 02:42.980]  Here I am already.
[02:42.980 --> 02:43.980]  That was quick.
[02:43.980 --> 02:44.980]  I took a lot of fat dabs.
[02:44.980 --> 02:45.980]  I feel a lot better.
[02:45.980 --> 02:49.700]  So I wasn't going to do a full episode on Subcool.
[02:49.700 --> 02:51.380]  I had some other stuff I was going to talk about here.
[02:51.380 --> 02:53.460]  I was going to do a regular show.
[02:53.460 --> 02:56.700]  But while I was taking my dabs, I was just chilling and thinking about Subby.
[02:56.700 --> 02:58.940]  And I was like, we should give the dude a full show.
[02:58.940 --> 02:59.940]  Why not?
[02:59.940 --> 03:03.220]  So this is going to be a brief episode, fully dedicated to Subcool.
[03:03.220 --> 03:05.140]  I'm sitting here dabbing.
[03:05.140 --> 03:06.140]  I'm trying to catch my breath.
[03:06.140 --> 03:09.020]  No, I just didn't want any of these thoughts to escape my head.
[03:09.020 --> 03:11.020]  So I just wanted to hit record and get talking.
[03:11.020 --> 03:17.020]  But I remember chilling out way back in the day, growing Subcool strains and sitting on
[03:17.020 --> 03:23.420]  the couch watching Subcool's Weed Nerd videos while I was trimming Subcool strains.
[03:23.420 --> 03:25.660]  So I've been following Subby for quite a while.
[03:25.660 --> 03:28.860]  I was watching the Weed Nerd shows before they were the Weed Nerd.
[03:28.860 --> 03:32.500]  He had a bunch of just random Subcool videos that he would put out.
[03:32.500 --> 03:36.220]  And I remember watching all of those way before he was the Weed Nerd.
[03:36.220 --> 03:42.860]  I think some of the very first seeds I purchased from the Attitude Seed Bank, my first order
[03:42.860 --> 03:45.100]  had Subcool seeds in that order.
[03:45.100 --> 03:47.100]  They were TGA Subcool seeds.
[03:47.100 --> 03:48.660]  I remember ordering them.
[03:48.660 --> 03:52.580]  So I've been following Subcool for quite a while, and I've learned a lot from the guy.
[03:52.580 --> 03:57.140]  One thing I will address before we get too far is, yeah, the dude had some quirks.
[03:57.140 --> 03:58.820]  He did some weird shit.
[03:58.820 --> 04:03.100]  But we all have our own quirks, and we all do weird shit.
[04:03.100 --> 04:07.220]  I'm going to excuse that for this episode because I've got nothing but love and respect
[04:07.220 --> 04:09.220]  for the guy, and this is a tribute to him.
[04:09.220 --> 04:13.380]  So if you're going to say something negative about him in the comments or out loud or something,
[04:13.380 --> 04:15.860]  just shut the fuck up right now because I've got his back.
[04:15.860 --> 04:18.460]  So I want to keep moving forward with my tribute to my bro.
[04:18.460 --> 04:20.820]  I just had to address that.
[04:20.820 --> 04:21.820]  Subcool is a teacher, bro.
[04:21.820 --> 04:26.220]  He taught me so much, and you can see it in my gross style.
[04:26.220 --> 04:29.500]  I used to run seven-gallon pots with tomato cages.
[04:29.500 --> 04:30.500]  I used to top them.
[04:30.500 --> 04:32.180]  I used to branch them out real wide.
[04:32.260 --> 04:33.900]  I used to cram too many into a room.
[04:33.900 --> 04:35.980]  I used to get the light too close to them.
[04:35.980 --> 04:39.180]  My rooms looked just like Subcool came in there and built my rooms.
[04:39.180 --> 04:42.020]  You could see my evolution of my growing.
[04:42.020 --> 04:46.020]  I was doing a whole bunch of one-gallon pots and trying to pack the room, and then I started
[04:46.020 --> 04:49.340]  watching Subcool, and he was like, why don't you top them, spread them out a little bit,
[04:49.340 --> 04:53.580]  put them in tomato cages, get a little bit bigger of a plant, start growing it this way.
[04:53.580 --> 04:56.580]  He was showing me that he was pulling this much weight from each plant, and I was like,
[04:56.580 --> 04:58.660]  well, shit, I'm running the same genetics.
[04:58.660 --> 04:59.660]  Why don't I do it that way?
[04:59.660 --> 05:00.980]  And it started working really well.
[05:00.980 --> 05:05.060]  I got better at growing through watching a lot of Subcool stuff.
[05:05.060 --> 05:09.180]  And then if I or anybody else ever had a question about something he said on the Weed Nerd Show,
[05:09.180 --> 05:11.500]  you could just send him a message and he would answer you.
[05:11.500 --> 05:12.500]  He would answer you directly.
[05:12.500 --> 05:14.660]  He'd say, oh, bro, this is what's going on.
[05:14.660 --> 05:16.500]  Then he would ask you questions.
[05:16.500 --> 05:18.980]  That means when he's asking questions, he actually cares.
[05:18.980 --> 05:19.980]  He's engaging.
[05:19.980 --> 05:23.900]  He wants more info so that he can answer you again appropriately and get your garden going.
[05:23.900 --> 05:26.180]  So Subcool was a great resource.
[05:26.180 --> 05:28.740]  He was a valuable asset to a new grower.
[05:28.740 --> 05:31.420]  He was a valuable asset to an educated grower.
[05:31.420 --> 05:32.740]  He knew a lot of shit.
[05:32.740 --> 05:35.460]  He knew a lot of ins and outs of the industry.
[05:35.460 --> 05:40.260]  He made some predictions to me in conversations about the industry, about people, and that
[05:40.260 --> 05:43.100]  shit always came true.
[05:43.100 --> 05:47.380]  Another thing I need to give Subcool some credit for is a lot of the development of
[05:47.380 --> 05:49.540]  my cannabis photography.
[05:49.540 --> 05:54.100]  He inspired me and educated me a lot on my cannabis photography.
[05:54.100 --> 05:58.380]  The way I frame a shot, the way I outline a shot, the way I background a shot, the way
[05:58.540 --> 06:02.580]  I set up a shot is very inspired by Subcool.
[06:02.580 --> 06:05.260]  Subcool put out a couple of books.
[06:05.260 --> 06:10.540]  Subcool's The Science of Dank had a lot of great photography, and that photography really
[06:10.540 --> 06:12.700]  improved my photography.
[06:12.700 --> 06:17.540]  It inspired me so much that I wanted to do things differently, and I started taking better
[06:17.540 --> 06:18.860]  photos.
[06:18.860 --> 06:22.900]  That leads me into another thing that I really want to shout Subcool out for.
[06:22.900 --> 06:28.340]  Subby was one of the first people I saw taking and sharing photos of male plants.
[06:29.300 --> 06:34.180]  He was posting photos of one of his legendary studs that he called the Space Dude.
[06:34.180 --> 06:37.780]  He was posting those photos a long time ago in forums.
[06:37.780 --> 06:40.500]  The Space Dude is featured in a book.
[06:40.500 --> 06:44.220]  There are so many beautiful pictures of the male flowers.
[06:44.220 --> 06:45.460]  We don't see enough of that.
[06:45.460 --> 06:49.500]  Sub took some great, great shots of his male plants and shared those.
[06:49.500 --> 06:53.940]  He told a lot of great stories about how he found his male plant, and then he used the
[06:53.940 --> 06:55.860]  shit out of that male plant.
[06:55.860 --> 06:57.660]  You may see some similarities here.
[06:57.660 --> 07:01.540]  I did find a stud male, and of course, I used the shit out of him.
[07:01.540 --> 07:05.380]  He became just as popular as some of my females.
[07:05.380 --> 07:09.300]  For some of you, it sounds like I'm just kissing this old guy's ass, but he was honestly very
[07:09.300 --> 07:12.740]  important and very influential in my development.
[07:12.740 --> 07:17.980]  I read genetics would not exist if Subcool did not pave the way and teach me how to do
[07:17.980 --> 07:18.980]  this.
[07:18.980 --> 07:22.340]  There are a lot of other breeders and growers and influential people along that path, but
[07:22.340 --> 07:27.220]  Subcool was a very big part of my education and my development.
[07:27.780 --> 07:28.860]  He was doing the Weed Nerd show.
[07:28.860 --> 07:31.540]  He kind of taught us how to go online and do this sort of thing.
[07:31.540 --> 07:33.700]  He was doing it before a lot of us.
[07:33.700 --> 07:38.060]  Subcool did inspire me and kind of teach me how to do it in a way.
[07:38.060 --> 07:39.500]  He's got a few years on me.
[07:39.500 --> 07:41.060]  He got started before me.
[07:41.060 --> 07:46.020]  He definitely had a great torch to pass, and I'm proud to have grabbed one of the torches
[07:46.020 --> 07:50.620]  that Subcool is passing out to keep carrying because he taught a lot of people.
[07:50.620 --> 07:53.300]  Subcool did a lot of time for cannabis.
[07:53.300 --> 07:58.700]  Subcool has been arrested and served a lot of his life in jail because of this cannabis
[07:58.700 --> 07:59.700]  plant.
[07:59.700 --> 08:01.180]  We got to give a big shout out to Miss Jill.
[08:01.180 --> 08:05.940]  While Subby was serving time, Miss Jill was finding cannabis books.
[08:05.940 --> 08:10.180]  In jail, you can't have books that have the word weed or cannabis or reefer in it, right?
[08:10.180 --> 08:14.660]  You definitely can't have books that teach you how to grow cannabis in jail.
[08:14.660 --> 08:19.340]  Miss Jill was finding cannabis grow books and rewriting them and taking out the word
[08:19.340 --> 08:24.420]  cannabis and putting tomatoes or blueberries in there so that Sub was able to read these
[08:24.420 --> 08:28.540]  books while he was in jail and keep up on his cannabis education.
[08:28.540 --> 08:31.100]  So we got to give a big shout out to Miss Jill also.
[08:31.100 --> 08:33.380]  She was a huge part of TGA.
[08:33.380 --> 08:35.380]  She is actually now the owner of TGA.
[08:35.380 --> 08:37.220]  So big shout out to Jill.
[08:37.220 --> 08:40.540]  I do know that Sub and Jill had a rocky relationship.
[08:40.540 --> 08:41.540]  That was very public.
[08:41.540 --> 08:45.220]  I'm not putting any information out there that's private, but I do know they resolved
[08:45.220 --> 08:47.340]  their shit before Subby was gone.
[08:47.340 --> 08:51.180]  I know that she was a huge part of the team and she took great care of Sub and Jill takes
[08:51.180 --> 08:52.980]  great care of everybody around her.
[08:52.980 --> 08:57.260]  So I want to send her a big shout out also, since we're talking about TGA and the Green
[08:57.260 --> 09:02.660]  Avenger family and Subcool history, because Jill is a major part of that.
[09:02.660 --> 09:04.700]  Jill actually bred the Jilly Bean.
[09:04.700 --> 09:09.460]  So when you talk about Jilly Bean coming from Subcool and TGA, that was one of Miss Jill's
[09:09.460 --> 09:10.460]  creations.
[09:10.460 --> 09:11.620]  She's still killing it.
[09:11.620 --> 09:15.660]  So make sure you guys support TGA and Miss Jill still, but I wanted to make sure to send
[09:15.660 --> 09:16.740]  her some love.
[09:16.740 --> 09:17.980]  She took care of Subby.
[09:17.980 --> 09:20.080]  She helped out Subby while he was in jail.
[09:20.080 --> 09:22.980]  She was a great partner in crime for Subcool.
[09:22.980 --> 09:26.140]  I've been going for almost 10 minutes talking about my buddy Subby.
[09:26.140 --> 09:29.740]  I'm going to wrap up this tribute here very quickly, but let's talk about some of the
[09:29.740 --> 09:33.780]  strains that Subcool is very known for breeding.
[09:33.780 --> 09:37.940]  You guys, if you have ever smoked Jack the Ripper, that is a Subcool strain.
[09:37.940 --> 09:41.700]  If you've ever smoked Space Queen, that was a Subcool and Miss Jill strain.
[09:41.700 --> 09:45.600]  That could have been Miss Jill, but I'm sure Sub and Miss Jill worked on that one together.
[09:45.600 --> 09:48.720]  If you've ever smoked Vortex, that was from Subcool.
[09:48.720 --> 09:53.760]  A lot of that old stuff back in the day was coming from Subcool and you didn't even know
[09:53.760 --> 09:54.760]  it.
[09:54.760 --> 09:59.720]  Back around 2010, there was a dispensary in Denver called The Clinic and they carried
[09:59.720 --> 10:05.540]  some Vortex batter that was bred by Subcool and grown by somebody there in Denver and
[10:05.540 --> 10:10.440]  extracted by a local guy in Denver and it was available on the shelf at The Clinic.
[10:10.440 --> 10:15.640]  That Vortex concentrate was one of my favorite concentrates ever.
[10:15.640 --> 10:18.520]  That place is 130 miles from my house.
[10:18.520 --> 10:19.680]  I would drive up there.
[10:19.680 --> 10:24.560]  As soon as I saw that shit come up on Weedmaps, I would drive up there and buy as much as
[10:24.560 --> 10:26.480]  they would sell me.
[10:26.480 --> 10:30.220]  Then they started making limits, so I had to take friends with me so they could buy
[10:30.220 --> 10:32.800]  as much as they would sell them also.
[10:32.800 --> 10:35.600]  I used to love that Vortex concentrate.
[10:35.600 --> 10:37.120]  It would give me the dab sweats.
[10:37.120 --> 10:38.960]  It would make me shake a little bit.
[10:38.960 --> 10:41.000]  It would give me a little bit of paranoia.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.200]  I'd be looking for my sunglasses while I was fucking wearing them.
[10:44.200 --> 10:46.920]  I'd try to find my keys while they were in my hand.
[10:46.920 --> 10:47.920]  It was amazing.
[10:47.920 --> 10:51.760]  I love that sort of high, so I missed that Vortex concentrate.
[10:51.760 --> 10:54.240]  But that's the kind of stuff that Subcool bred.
[10:54.240 --> 10:58.880]  Mostly sativa dominant, kind of high THC, a lot of real candy flavored sort of stuff,
[10:58.880 --> 11:05.360]  but he did a lot of great breeding and I used many of his creations in my work.
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.520]  I actually used his plush berry in my black cherry chem.
[11:09.520 --> 11:13.160]  I also used his space queen in one of my crosses.
[11:13.160 --> 11:14.960]  I used a female space queen.
[11:14.960 --> 11:18.800]  I reversed a Grateful Dog plant and I made what I called Space Bitch.
[11:18.800 --> 11:22.080]  It was space queen to Grateful Dog and it was feminized.
[11:22.080 --> 11:28.800]  I found a sweet female out of there and I pollinated that with my Arise male and I called
[11:28.800 --> 11:30.800]  that creation Space Force.
[11:30.800 --> 11:32.000]  That is still available today.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.480]  There are only a few packs left, but Space Force is one of my crosses that came from
[11:37.480 --> 11:38.960]  one of Subcool's creations.
[11:38.960 --> 11:41.760]  So you guys, I just wanted to take a minute.
[11:41.760 --> 11:45.840]  Actually, I guess I wanted to take 12 minutes and I wanted to kind of pay tribute to somebody
[11:45.840 --> 11:51.220]  who really helped me develop as a cannabis grower, as a cannabis breeder, as a cannabis
[11:51.220 --> 11:53.800]  business person, as a cannabis educator.
[11:53.800 --> 11:56.680]  I wanted to give a giant shout out to my friend Subcool.
[11:56.680 --> 11:58.360]  So Subcool, thank you, bro.
[11:58.360 --> 12:02.120]  I wouldn't be where I am without your guidance and inspiration.
[12:02.120 --> 12:05.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to do a lot of advertising at the end of this show.
[12:05.200 --> 12:06.520]  I want to thank you for listening.
[12:06.520 --> 12:10.960]  I want to give a giant shout out to Subcool, giant shout out to Ms. Jill, and a giant shout
[12:10.960 --> 12:13.720]  out to the entire TGA crew.
[12:13.720 --> 12:17.000]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
