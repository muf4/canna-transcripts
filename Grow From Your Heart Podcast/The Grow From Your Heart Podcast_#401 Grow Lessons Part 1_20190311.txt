[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[00:02.600 --> 00:09.600]  Hey everyone, this is Daphne Brani and you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:09.600 --> 00:18.020]  Rasta Jeff, you bad motherfucker.
[00:18.020 --> 00:19.500]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:19.500 --> 00:23.640]  It's time for episode 401 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.640 --> 00:26.100]  This episode is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:26.100 --> 00:29.880]  If you need new seeds for your garden, you can get them through Oregon Elite Seeds and
[00:29.880 --> 00:35.680]  you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:35.680 --> 00:39.440]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:39.440 --> 00:45.580]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Star Guava HCFSE from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:45.580 --> 00:52.960]  This label says it is 66.2% THC with a total of 76.5% total cannabinoids.
[00:52.960 --> 00:54.840]  You guys, this concentrate is just ridiculous.
[00:54.840 --> 00:58.600]  I'm taking the lid off the jar right now, give it a little smell.
[00:58.600 --> 01:00.640]  I don't even have to get it close to my face.
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.680]  It smells like ridiculous gas and rotten fruit and it is deliciously amazing.
[01:05.680 --> 01:09.360]  It kind of almost makes your eyes kind of itch a little bit when you smell it real hard.
[01:09.360 --> 01:11.360]  This stuff is delicious.
[01:11.360 --> 01:13.880]  The color and consistency are ridiculous.
[01:13.880 --> 01:16.520]  It's kind of like shiny yellow diamonds.
[01:16.520 --> 01:19.760]  I know diamonds are supposed to be clear, but it's kind of like some shiny citrines,
[01:19.760 --> 01:20.760]  I guess.
[01:20.760 --> 01:25.200]  This stuff is beautiful and I think you can tell by the early show rambles that this concentrate
[01:25.200 --> 01:26.200]  is amazing.
[01:26.440 --> 01:33.320]  Big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious Star Guava HCFSE.
[01:33.320 --> 01:36.440]  If you've been following the podcast for a while, you know that a while back I did a
[01:36.440 --> 01:41.700]  really long grow series that started at making a solid strategy and plan for our grow and
[01:41.700 --> 01:44.600]  ended with sampling our finished product.
[01:44.600 --> 01:47.560]  I got a great response to that grow series.
[01:47.560 --> 01:51.560]  When I did the series, there were several episode interruptions because a lot of great
[01:51.560 --> 01:52.720]  things came up.
[01:52.720 --> 01:54.160]  Mike came over and wanted to hang out.
[01:54.160 --> 01:55.560]  There was news to report.
[01:55.600 --> 01:58.200]  So the lessons were kind of broken up.
[01:58.200 --> 02:04.040]  I thought it would be a good idea to combine those lessons into really long episodes.
[02:04.040 --> 02:09.200]  So this will be the first compilation of grow lesson episodes.
[02:09.200 --> 02:18.820]  This episode will be a compilation of episodes 351, 52, 54, 55, 56, and 357.
[02:18.820 --> 02:21.440]  This episode will be about three hours long.
[02:21.440 --> 02:25.460]  The next episode, again, will be another chunk of grow lessons.
[02:25.460 --> 02:31.220]  My goal is to re-release all of the grow lessons in long episode form without any interruptions.
[02:31.220 --> 02:36.220]  So with no further ado, let's jump into this first chunk of repost grow lesson episodes.
[02:36.220 --> 02:40.220]  3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0.
[02:40.220 --> 02:53.190]  Discoveries for computers now have primary control of critical vehicle functions.
[02:53.190 --> 02:55.190]  I have a B in orbit.
[02:57.690 --> 02:59.190]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[02:59.450 --> 03:02.450]  It's time for episode 351 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:02.450 --> 03:03.450]  Thanks for joining me.
[03:03.450 --> 03:04.950]  No long fancy intro today.
[03:04.950 --> 03:06.950]  We're going to get right into this podcast.
[03:06.950 --> 03:10.950]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[03:10.950 --> 03:16.950]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[03:16.950 --> 03:21.450]  And you can find them at dankseed.store.
[03:21.450 --> 03:24.450]  You guys know I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[03:24.450 --> 03:27.450]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Lammy Bar Nectar.
[03:27.710 --> 03:30.710]  This is a combo of lemon essence and papaya.
[03:30.710 --> 03:34.710]  The flavor is described as honeysuckle, lemon candy, and lemon candies.
[03:34.710 --> 03:36.710]  We've talked about this one on the show before.
[03:36.710 --> 03:41.710]  I think the dab I just took tasted a lot like kiwi strawberry Snapple.
[03:41.710 --> 03:43.710]  So that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[03:43.710 --> 03:45.710]  Let's move this podcast forward.
[03:45.710 --> 03:47.710]  I've got a lot to talk about today.
[03:47.710 --> 03:56.710]  I have been talking about doing a series of episodes that run my listeners from the very beginning of a grow all the way to the very end of a grow.
[03:56.970 --> 03:58.970]  I want to talk about selecting your grow space.
[03:58.970 --> 04:05.970]  I want to talk about sprouting seeds and cutting clones all the way through the veg phase, all the way to flower, all the way up to harvest.
[04:05.970 --> 04:07.970]  And then we'll talk about drying and curing once again.
[04:07.970 --> 04:09.970]  I want to go from beginning to end.
[04:09.970 --> 04:11.970]  I'm going to do a long series of detailed episodes.
[04:11.970 --> 04:15.970]  And this will be the first episode in that series.
[04:15.970 --> 04:18.970]  In this episode, we're going to talk about planning your garden.
[04:18.970 --> 04:20.970]  We'll talk about setting goals for your garden.
[04:21.230 --> 04:29.230]  And I will also give you a few tips on how to stay out of trouble and avoid common mistakes people make when setting up a new grow.
[04:29.230 --> 04:32.230]  So now that I've got a solid intro laid down, I'm going to press pause.
[04:32.230 --> 04:35.230]  I'm going to take a couple of dabs while you grab a notebook.
[04:35.230 --> 04:39.230]  And when we get back, we're going to talk about planning your cannabis garden.
[04:39.230 --> 04:41.230]  All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[04:41.230 --> 04:42.230]  I am well-medicated.
[04:42.230 --> 04:43.230]  I am well-hydrated.
[04:43.230 --> 04:49.230]  I hope you grabbed a pen and some paper because there will be a lot of information in this episode.
[04:49.490 --> 04:52.490]  Let's get into planning your new garden.
[04:52.490 --> 04:55.490]  Before we start shopping for lights and seeds and planning for your first harvest,
[04:55.490 --> 05:01.490]  there are a few things you can do to make your growing experience more enjoyable.
[05:01.490 --> 05:09.490]  The first piece of advice I have for anybody who is planning to start a new grow is to buy grow books from reputable grow authors.
[05:09.490 --> 05:17.490]  Authors I can recommend are Ed Rosenthal, Jorge Cervantes, Greg Green, Robert Connell-Clark, and Drew West.
[05:17.750 --> 05:21.750]  The second piece of advice is to open those books and read them.
[05:21.750 --> 05:25.750]  I recommend you read the whole book before you start growing.
[05:25.750 --> 05:28.750]  That way you know what to expect before problems arise.
[05:28.750 --> 05:32.750]  That way if a problem does pop up, you know what you've got because you've seen it in the book.
[05:32.750 --> 05:34.750]  You know how to diagnose it.
[05:34.750 --> 05:35.750]  You know how to treat it.
[05:35.750 --> 05:40.750]  That way you don't make the problem worse by diagnosing a problem under pressure and making the wrong decision.
[05:40.750 --> 05:46.750]  So get yourself a grow book from a reputable grower and read that book.
[05:47.010 --> 05:49.010]  I can recommend authors I can recommend.
[05:49.010 --> 05:55.010]  I like Ed Rosenthal, Jorge Cervantes, Greg Green, Robert Connell-Clark, Drew West.
[05:55.010 --> 05:58.010]  There are a ton of great cannabis authors out there.
[05:58.010 --> 06:03.010]  Reading books will give you an idea of what to expect and you'll have an eye for things when they pop up.
[06:03.010 --> 06:05.010]  You won't have as many surprises.
[06:05.010 --> 06:09.010]  You can find books from most of the authors I listed on Amazon.
[06:09.010 --> 06:15.010]  You can also find a lot of great free PDF files if you do a quick Google search.
[06:15.270 --> 06:19.270]  Another way to gain cannabis knowledge is by listening to cannabis podcasts.
[06:19.270 --> 06:23.270]  If you're a new grower, I recommend shows like The Dude Grows and Free Weed.
[06:23.270 --> 06:30.270]  If you're an advanced grower, I recommend shows like Cannabis Cultivation and Sciences and Shaping Fire.
[06:30.270 --> 06:34.270]  Another great way to learn about cannabis is through YouTube.
[06:34.270 --> 06:38.270]  There are a lot of great cannabis YouTube channels out there,
[06:38.270 --> 06:44.270]  but you don't have to watch cannabis specific videos to learn about growing.
[06:44.530 --> 06:47.530]  You can watch basic plant biology and basic horticulture videos,
[06:47.530 --> 06:51.530]  and most of that is going to apply to your cannabis garden.
[06:51.530 --> 06:53.530]  Learn about the plants, learn about the way that they function,
[06:53.530 --> 06:57.530]  and learn why they do what they do through those YouTube videos.
[06:57.530 --> 07:00.530]  One thing I would avoid is cannabis forums.
[07:00.530 --> 07:03.530]  There is a lot of crap in cannabis forums.
[07:03.530 --> 07:05.530]  That's part of why I started this show.
[07:05.530 --> 07:10.530]  I saw people giving terrible advice on cannabis forums, and I wanted to come on here and correct that.
[07:10.790 --> 07:14.790]  Be really careful if you're taking advice from cannabis forums.
[07:14.790 --> 07:23.790]  I would recommend you avoid them completely and stick with books, podcasts, and YouTube channels from reputable growers.
[07:23.790 --> 07:27.790]  My first piece of advice is to buy and read grow books from reputable growers,
[07:27.790 --> 07:33.790]  then supplement that education with knowledge from YouTube and podcasts.
[07:33.790 --> 07:38.790]  Before we go too much further with our plans to grow, we've got some things to consider.
[07:39.050 --> 07:42.050]  An important thing to think about is legality.
[07:42.050 --> 07:45.050]  Is it legal to grow where you're planning to set up?
[07:45.050 --> 07:48.050]  If it is illegal, I can't recommend you grow there.
[07:48.050 --> 07:51.050]  I've got to tell you to obey the laws.
[07:51.050 --> 07:57.050]  If you do choose to grow in an illegal area, keep in mind that you are now committing a crime
[07:57.050 --> 08:05.050]  that could result in a life-changing experience for you, your family, and everyone in that household.
[08:05.310 --> 08:08.310]  If you are suspected of running an illegal grow in your home,
[08:08.310 --> 08:12.310]  the police, possibly the SWAT team, possibly the DEA,
[08:12.310 --> 08:18.310]  will kick in your door and drag you and your family into your front lawn in your underwear,
[08:18.310 --> 08:20.310]  while they destroy your entire house.
[08:20.310 --> 08:23.310]  They go through everything.
[08:23.310 --> 08:25.310]  They will take all of your money.
[08:25.310 --> 08:27.310]  They'll take your firearms if you have any.
[08:27.310 --> 08:29.310]  They will probably shoot your dog.
[08:29.310 --> 08:31.310]  They may shoot you.
[08:31.570 --> 08:37.570]  If your family is home, they will be detained and possibly shot if they don't react properly to police instructions.
[08:37.570 --> 08:40.570]  Your house is now a drug house.
[08:40.570 --> 08:42.570]  They come in ready for war.
[08:42.570 --> 08:46.570]  Your wife and kids will never forget the morning the door came off
[08:46.570 --> 08:50.570]  and armed men came in and took you to jail and destroyed the house.
[08:50.570 --> 08:53.570]  Your life will never be the same.
[08:53.570 --> 08:56.570]  Think about this before you choose to set up.
[08:56.830 --> 08:57.830]  I know that sounds dramatic.
[08:57.830 --> 09:01.830]  It is dramatic and it will be traumatic for you and everyone involved.
[09:01.830 --> 09:03.830]  I can't stress this enough.
[09:03.830 --> 09:07.830]  Think about this before you hang up your grow lights.
[09:07.830 --> 09:10.830]  Think about this before you order your seeds.
[09:10.830 --> 09:14.830]  Also keep in mind that you are producing a high-value product.
[09:14.830 --> 09:19.830]  Start thinking now about what you're going to do if somebody tries to come in your home
[09:19.830 --> 09:21.830]  and take that from you while you are there.
[09:22.090 --> 09:27.090]  Think about it now so that you know what you're getting into before the time comes.
[09:27.090 --> 09:32.090]  Now that I've made that important disclaimer, let's move forward.
[09:32.090 --> 09:34.090]  Let's think about why you are growing.
[09:34.090 --> 09:36.090]  Are you growing to supply yourself?
[09:36.090 --> 09:38.090]  Are you growing to supply a sick family member?
[09:38.090 --> 09:40.090]  Are you trying to be the next Neighborhood Hookup?
[09:40.090 --> 09:44.090]  Are you trying to be the next Pablo Escobar of cannabis?
[09:44.090 --> 09:49.090]  Think about the real reason for your growth and have a goal in mind.
[09:49.350 --> 09:55.350]  If your goal is to supply yourself, think about how much product you need every 60 to 90 days
[09:55.350 --> 10:01.350]  and set up a grow that will supply that for yourself, plus maybe a little extra in case you have an issue
[10:01.350 --> 10:04.350]  or a delay in your next cycle.
[10:04.350 --> 10:08.350]  Growing enough product to supply yourself should be an easy goal.
[10:08.350 --> 10:12.350]  Growing enough to supply the whole neighborhood is when it starts to get risky.
[10:12.350 --> 10:18.350]  Every time you hang up another light, you increase your chances of trouble exponentially, in my opinion.
[10:18.610 --> 10:21.610]  So think about the risks involved before you expand.
[10:21.610 --> 10:27.610]  I always recommend starting small, learning how to grow, and then expand from there.
[10:27.610 --> 10:33.610]  So think about what you realistically expect from your grow and set a goal for yourself.
[10:33.610 --> 10:38.610]  Your grow is going to be limited by the amount of space you have, the amount of equipment you have,
[10:38.610 --> 10:42.610]  and also the amount of electricity you can provide to that space.
[10:42.870 --> 10:48.870]  One of your goals is to figure out how to maximize the yield from the amount of space you have got.
[10:48.870 --> 10:53.870]  A reasonable goal is one pound per thousand watt light.
[10:53.870 --> 10:59.870]  And a thousand watt light usually is good for about a 4x4 to a 5x5 space.
[10:59.870 --> 11:05.870]  So you would expect about one pound per every 4x4 or 5x5 foot space.
[11:05.870 --> 11:09.870]  Now don't expect that right away. You've got to learn how to grow.
[11:10.130 --> 11:12.130]  You've got to learn the genetics. You've got to learn your nutrients.
[11:12.130 --> 11:14.130]  And you've got to dial in the room.
[11:14.130 --> 11:19.130]  But to give you guys an estimate and help you design and set up your room and understand how to reach your goals,
[11:19.130 --> 11:25.130]  you can reasonably expect one pound per thousand watt light once you get good at growing.
[11:25.130 --> 11:30.130]  Now once you really get good at growing, you should increase that goal to closer to two pounds per light.
[11:30.130 --> 11:37.130]  And if you move into the double-ended bulb technology, you can certainly increase your expectations much more with more lighting.
[11:37.390 --> 11:42.390]  Of course, all of what I'm talking about is with high-pressure sodium lighting, high-intensity discharge lighting.
[11:42.390 --> 11:48.390]  I do not have enough experience with LEDs to give you any estimates or expectations.
[11:48.390 --> 11:52.390]  And again, this is all just rough expectations, rough estimates.
[11:52.390 --> 11:57.390]  About a pound per thousand watt light is your general goal once you learn how to grow.
[11:57.390 --> 12:00.390]  Don't focus too much on yields when you're getting started.
[12:00.390 --> 12:05.390]  Focus more on learning the needs of the plant, understanding the cycles of the plant,
[12:05.650 --> 12:08.650]  and learning how to see what the plants are telling you.
[12:08.650 --> 12:12.650]  Focus more on that when you get started, then the yields will come, the quality will come.
[12:12.650 --> 12:16.650]  When you develop a relationship with the plant, everything will fall into place.
[12:16.650 --> 12:22.650]  So learn how to grow. I'm just giving you a rough idea of what you can expect once you get dialed in.
[12:22.650 --> 12:26.650]  Now let's get back on track with things we need to think about when planning our grow.
[12:26.650 --> 12:29.650]  The next thing I've got written down is safety and security.
[12:29.910 --> 12:32.910]  We're going to talk about that in detail in the next episode,
[12:32.910 --> 12:35.910]  which is going to be selecting and planning your space.
[12:35.910 --> 12:37.910]  This is going to be overall planning your grow.
[12:37.910 --> 12:40.910]  The next episode will focus more in on your space.
[12:40.910 --> 12:43.910]  So for safety and security, we're going to go quickly.
[12:43.910 --> 12:46.910]  You need to worry about the law. I already talked in depth about that.
[12:46.910 --> 12:50.910]  You need to worry about thieves and criminals. I already talked a little bit about that.
[12:50.910 --> 12:53.910]  So safety and security will be discussed more in the next episode.
[12:54.170 --> 12:57.170]  Another thing I've got is water.
[12:57.170 --> 13:01.170]  Is water accessible and affordable where you plan to grow?
[13:01.170 --> 13:05.170]  Also, do you have an excuse for the extra water consumption?
[13:05.170 --> 13:08.170]  The next thing on the list is electricity.
[13:08.170 --> 13:16.170]  When you're planning your grow, keep in mind that you will be very limited by the amount of electricity you can pull from a home.
[13:16.170 --> 13:21.170]  Most homes have a 1 or 200 amp service depending on your location.
[13:21.430 --> 13:26.430]  If you've only got a 100 amp service, you will be very limited on how many lights you can run.
[13:26.430 --> 13:29.430]  If you've got 200 amps of service, you'll still be limited.
[13:29.430 --> 13:36.430]  In my experience, when they put the electricity in your house, they did not consider you adding 1000 watt grow lights.
[13:36.430 --> 13:43.430]  They put just enough for you to run all of the appliances and things in your house and also plug in the blow dryer and the microwave.
[13:43.430 --> 13:50.430]  They don't give you a lot of extra amperage because they never thought you were going to plug in these high powered devices.
[13:50.690 --> 13:53.690]  You're going to be limited by the amount of electricity.
[13:53.690 --> 14:01.690]  Before you go out and buy 4 1000 watt lights, maybe buy 2 and plug them both in and see if you start flipping breakers.
[14:01.690 --> 14:08.690]  I'm sure you won't be able to plug in 2 1000 watt lights into the same receptacle in one room.
[14:08.690 --> 14:11.690]  That little plug in right there, it's got the plug in on top, the plug in on the bottom.
[14:11.690 --> 14:14.690]  You've got your phone plugged into one, you've got the computer plugged into the other.
[14:14.690 --> 14:17.690]  You cannot plug in 2 1000 watt lights into that.
[14:17.690 --> 14:19.690]  That will flip the breaker.
[14:19.950 --> 14:23.950]  You're going to run out to the garage or wherever, you're going to flip the breaker, you're going to make it come on again.
[14:23.950 --> 14:26.950]  It's going to start heating up the receptacle, it's going to blow the receptacle.
[14:26.950 --> 14:29.950]  Or it's going to catch the wires on fire.
[14:29.950 --> 14:33.950]  Don't try to plug in 2 1000 watt lights into the same plug in.
[14:33.950 --> 14:40.950]  You might not even be able to run 2 1000 watt lights in the same room if both of the plug ins are on the same breaker.
[14:40.950 --> 14:48.950]  Most of the breakers in your house are going to be 10 amps, maybe 20 amps, and maybe 35 amps if you're really lucky.
[14:49.210 --> 14:54.210]  Older homes are going to have 10s and 20s, more modern homes you may have up to 35 amp breakers.
[14:54.210 --> 14:59.210]  Most of our 1000 watt grow lights pull about 8 to 11 amps.
[14:59.210 --> 15:02.210]  When they fire up, they want to pull 11 amps to get started.
[15:02.210 --> 15:05.210]  As they're running, they'll drop down to around 7 or 8 amps.
[15:05.210 --> 15:10.210]  So you have to keep that in mind when you're designing and thinking about your grow.
[15:10.210 --> 15:14.210]  How much amperage is available in the space in which you plan to grow.
[15:14.210 --> 15:18.210]  And don't expect to run a bunch of extension cords because they're going to get hot, they're going to melt,
[15:18.470 --> 15:20.470]  they're going to catch on fire, they're going to start flipping breakers.
[15:20.470 --> 15:22.470]  That's going to cause more problems.
[15:22.470 --> 15:27.470]  Just realize that you either need to upgrade the electrical or you need to settle for less lights.
[15:27.470 --> 15:34.470]  Also keep in mind that for every light you hang, you probably need a blower or a fan or some sort of electricity.
[15:34.470 --> 15:38.470]  So allow extra amperage for your accessories.
[15:38.470 --> 15:39.470]  And you've also got to run the house.
[15:39.470 --> 15:45.470]  You have to turn on lights in the refrigerator and what if somebody tries to run the microwave and it blows up the whole grow.
[15:45.470 --> 15:46.470]  Keep that sort of stuff in mind.
[15:46.730 --> 15:50.730]  Don't burn down the house with your grow.
[15:50.730 --> 15:55.730]  So we'll talk more about electricity in the selecting your space episode as well.
[15:55.730 --> 15:56.730]  Also air flow.
[15:56.730 --> 15:57.730]  You're going to need air flow.
[15:57.730 --> 16:01.730]  We will talk in depth about air flow in the next episode.
[16:01.730 --> 16:02.730]  Trash.
[16:02.730 --> 16:10.730]  You guys, people don't consider how much trash they will create when they're building and running a grow.
[16:10.730 --> 16:14.730]  You're going to have boxes that say high pressure sodium grow light on them.
[16:14.990 --> 16:17.990]  You're going to have to think about how to get rid of that discreetly.
[16:17.990 --> 16:21.990]  You'll have empty nutrient bottles that you need to figure out how to get rid of discreetly.
[16:21.990 --> 16:28.990]  Then when we harvest, we've got to figure out how to get rid of that old root ball, all of the sticks and all of that dirt.
[16:28.990 --> 16:33.990]  So that's something to start thinking about before we start buying grow lights and buying our seeds.
[16:33.990 --> 16:37.990]  Another thing to think about is the odor and aroma of your grow.
[16:37.990 --> 16:40.990]  You don't want to snitch on yourself by having a stinky garden.
[16:41.250 --> 16:45.250]  If you do a good job, your plants are going to stink.
[16:45.250 --> 16:51.250]  You will need some sort of carbon filtration to prevent the whole neighborhood from smelling your grow.
[16:51.250 --> 16:58.250]  Something a lot of people don't think about is when you start cutting down your first grow, it really stinks.
[16:58.250 --> 17:03.250]  When you start chopping into those plants, you start breaking open the turps, that's when it really stinks.
[17:03.250 --> 17:09.250]  If you thought it smelled good around week 6, 7, and 8, wait until you cut them down and you start chopping into them.
[17:09.510 --> 17:13.510]  That's when it's really going to stink. So be prepared for that harvest stink.
[17:13.510 --> 17:17.510]  Also, at harvest time, you've got to think about that trash.
[17:17.510 --> 17:19.510]  You've got to think about all that soil.
[17:19.510 --> 17:24.510]  And then you've got a lot of herb to learn how to dry and cure and store.
[17:24.510 --> 17:28.510]  How are you going to dry it? How are you going to cure it? Do you have space for that?
[17:28.510 --> 17:31.510]  Where are you going to store it? Do you have space for that?
[17:31.510 --> 17:37.510]  So those are things to start thinking about before you hang up any lights and buy any seeds.
[17:37.770 --> 17:41.770]  Now here is a huge thing to think about when you're planting your grow.
[17:41.770 --> 17:43.770]  What kind of nutrients are you going to use?
[17:43.770 --> 17:45.770]  Are you going to go organic?
[17:45.770 --> 17:47.770]  Or are you going to go synthetic?
[17:47.770 --> 17:49.770]  Are you going to go a living soil?
[17:49.770 --> 17:51.770]  Are you going to go cocoa?
[17:51.770 --> 17:52.770]  Are you going to do no-till?
[17:52.770 --> 17:54.770]  Are you going to do hydro?
[17:54.770 --> 17:56.770]  All of that stuff is up to you.
[17:56.770 --> 17:58.770]  You've got a lot of decisions to make.
[17:58.770 --> 18:02.770]  Everything has its advantage and everything has its disadvantage.
[18:03.030 --> 18:11.030]  Through this long series of episodes, I will try to go over the pros and cons of organic and synthetic, of hydro and soil.
[18:11.030 --> 18:14.030]  I'll talk about cocoa. I'll talk about dirt.
[18:14.030 --> 18:18.030]  I will try to talk about all of that stuff and help you make those decisions.
[18:18.030 --> 18:21.030]  But now is the time to start thinking about it.
[18:21.030 --> 18:24.030]  Do you want to go organic? Do you want to go synthetic?
[18:24.030 --> 18:29.030]  Along with that decision comes pest control, integrated pest management.
[18:29.030 --> 18:32.030]  Do you want to apply spray applications of pesticides?
[18:32.290 --> 18:34.290]  Do you want to use predator bugs?
[18:34.290 --> 18:38.290]  All of these options have their pros and cons and they're all up to you.
[18:38.290 --> 18:44.290]  You'll need to find a pest management system that also works with your nutrient system.
[18:44.290 --> 18:49.290]  If you're running a full organic system, you don't want to go in there and apply a toxic pesticide
[18:49.290 --> 18:53.290]  that could disrupt the environment you've spent so much time creating.
[18:53.290 --> 18:57.290]  So one of your major things to think about will be your medium.
[18:57.290 --> 19:00.290]  Do you want to run soil, soilless mix, cocoa, perlite?
[19:00.550 --> 19:02.550]  Do you want to run rockwool cubes?
[19:02.550 --> 19:04.550]  It is all up to you.
[19:04.550 --> 19:08.550]  Along with that decision, you get to decide what you're going to feed those plants.
[19:08.550 --> 19:11.550]  Do you want to go all organic? Do you want to go full synthetics?
[19:11.550 --> 19:14.550]  Do you want to do a combo? That is up to you.
[19:14.550 --> 19:19.550]  Then another major part of that decision is how you are going to prevent pests.
[19:19.550 --> 19:21.550]  It will all work together.
[19:21.550 --> 19:27.550]  Your medium, your nutrients, and your integrated pest management will all become one big unit.
[19:27.810 --> 19:30.810]  Think about that in depth before you make any decisions.
[19:30.810 --> 19:36.810]  As this series continues, I will do a lot of discussions on most of those topics
[19:36.810 --> 19:39.810]  and try to guide you. I will try to remain unbiased.
[19:39.810 --> 19:44.810]  I will talk about how I grow and I will also try to give you unbiased information
[19:44.810 --> 19:51.810]  on other options and other methods that will work just as well as the way I have chosen to grow.
[19:51.810 --> 19:54.810]  That's part of the beauty of setting up your own grow.
[19:54.810 --> 19:56.810]  Nobody can tell you what to do. There's no right or wrong way.
[19:57.070 --> 19:59.070]  The wrong way is when your plants die.
[19:59.070 --> 20:03.070]  The right way is when you are happy and you're getting what you want out of the grow.
[20:03.070 --> 20:09.070]  If it's producing the quality, the amount, and you're satisfied, you're doing it correctly.
[20:09.070 --> 20:12.070]  You could probably improve a little bit, but you're doing it right.
[20:12.070 --> 20:16.070]  Nobody can tell you you're doing it wrong if you're happy with it. It's your grow.
[20:16.070 --> 20:19.070]  Like I said, you're doing it wrong when the plants die or when you get a bunch of bugs,
[20:19.070 --> 20:22.070]  but it's your grow. Make yourself happy.
[20:22.330 --> 20:27.330]  Once you put a lot of thought into your medium, your nutrients, your pest control,
[20:27.330 --> 20:32.330]  and if you want to go organic or synthetic, a few more things you should think about are
[20:32.330 --> 20:35.330]  do you want to grow from seed or from clone?
[20:35.330 --> 20:40.330]  I will do in-depth episodes in the very near future on the advantages and disadvantages
[20:40.330 --> 20:43.330]  of starting from seed or clone.
[20:43.330 --> 20:47.330]  Then I will also talk about how to sprout seeds and will also do episodes on cutting clones.
[20:47.590 --> 20:51.590]  I will go in-depth on that subject, but start thinking about that now.
[20:51.590 --> 20:55.590]  Do you want to grow from seed or do you want to grow from clone?
[20:55.590 --> 21:00.590]  Those are a bunch of great things to think about before you even buy a grow light.
[21:00.590 --> 21:02.590]  Buy a grow book and read it.
[21:02.590 --> 21:08.590]  Find more podcasts that you find educational and entertaining and listen to those podcasts.
[21:08.590 --> 21:12.590]  Then maybe find some YouTube channels that teach you about basic plant sciences
[21:12.850 --> 21:17.850]  and watch those in your free time and get a good understanding of the plant.
[21:17.850 --> 21:24.850]  Then you've got a lot of other things to think about. Legalities, safety and security, water, electricity.
[21:24.850 --> 21:28.850]  Do you have a good excuse for how much electricity you're about to start consuming?
[21:28.850 --> 21:31.850]  That's something to think about. Think about your trash.
[21:31.850 --> 21:34.850]  Think about the aroma you're going to create.
[21:34.850 --> 21:36.850]  Then you get to make that big debate.
[21:37.110 --> 21:42.110]  Nutrients, medium, organic versus synthetic and pesticides.
[21:42.110 --> 21:44.110]  That's something to think about now.
[21:44.110 --> 21:46.110]  Then you get to think about seeds or clones.
[21:46.110 --> 21:49.110]  That is a lot of stuff to have on your mind.
[21:49.110 --> 21:53.110]  The next thing is to think about where to put all of this stuff.
[21:53.110 --> 21:56.110]  Where are we going to put the lights? What room is this going to go in?
[21:56.110 --> 21:58.110]  I can already see the wheels turning in your head.
[21:58.110 --> 22:05.110]  In the next episode, we will go in-depth about where to put your grow, planning your grow space.
[22:05.370 --> 22:07.370]  We'll talk more in-depth about choosing the correct lighting.
[22:07.370 --> 22:09.370]  We'll talk more in-depth about airflow.
[22:09.370 --> 22:18.370]  We'll talk more in-depth about all of the specific needs you need to think about when planning your specific grow space in the next episode.
[22:18.370 --> 22:23.370]  I also told you I would give you tips on how to stay out of trouble.
[22:23.370 --> 22:29.370]  The number one tip to stay out of trouble when working in a grow is to keep your mouth shut.
[22:29.630 --> 22:34.630]  If you are in a legal area or an illegal area, keep your mouth shut.
[22:34.630 --> 22:38.630]  Why does anybody need to know you're growing cannabis?
[22:38.630 --> 22:43.630]  Why does anybody need to know you have a high-value product somewhere in your home?
[22:43.630 --> 22:47.630]  Why does anybody need to know you have an extra stream of income?
[22:47.630 --> 22:49.630]  Keep your mouth shut.
[22:49.630 --> 22:52.630]  You might think, what about my best friend?
[22:52.630 --> 22:56.630]  That's the best way to turn your best friend into somebody you can't trust.
[22:56.890 --> 22:57.890]  What about your girlfriend?
[22:57.890 --> 22:59.890]  Bro, she might not be your girlfriend forever.
[22:59.890 --> 23:01.890]  Do you want to worry about that shit when you guys break up?
[23:01.890 --> 23:03.890]  Don't tell anybody.
[23:03.890 --> 23:07.890]  Your family is shady. Your bro is shady. Your girlfriend is shady.
[23:07.890 --> 23:13.890]  Everybody changes when there is a high-value product sitting on the table and nobody's looking.
[23:13.890 --> 23:17.890]  The best way to keep yourself out of trouble is to not tell anybody.
[23:17.890 --> 23:22.890]  Another piece of advice is to not stink like herb all the time.
[23:23.150 --> 23:29.150]  Before you go places, take a shower, change your clothes, put on some non-herb stinking clothes.
[23:29.150 --> 23:33.150]  Also, don't always have a bunch of herb.
[23:33.150 --> 23:36.150]  Don't start selling herb and making a bunch of extra money.
[23:36.150 --> 23:39.150]  Don't start smoking excessively in front of people.
[23:39.150 --> 23:46.150]  Don't give anybody any obvious signs that you have got access to an excessive amount of cannabis suddenly.
[23:46.150 --> 23:51.150]  Don't raise any eyebrows and don't draw any extra attention to yourself.
[23:51.410 --> 23:52.410]  Stay out of trouble.
[23:52.410 --> 23:57.410]  So that's my quick advice on how to stay out of trouble when you are starting a new grow.
[23:57.410 --> 23:59.410]  Just don't tell anybody.
[23:59.410 --> 24:00.410]  Don't show off.
[24:00.410 --> 24:03.410]  Don't suddenly have too much money and too much herb.
[24:03.410 --> 24:04.410]  Stay low-key.
[24:04.410 --> 24:07.410]  Stay the person you were before you started growing.
[24:07.410 --> 24:11.410]  Just stop paying for herb and start growing your own.
[24:11.410 --> 24:16.410]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, that was the first episode in a long series of grow lessons.

[25:41.450 --> 25:43.450]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[25:43.450 --> 25:46.450]  It's time for episode 352 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[25:46.450 --> 25:51.450]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[25:51.450 --> 25:53.450]  If you need new seeds for your garden,
[25:53.450 --> 25:56.450]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[25:56.450 --> 25:59.450]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[25:59.450 --> 26:04.450]  You guys know I like to start the show off by keeping you updated on what I've been dabbing on.
[26:04.450 --> 26:09.450]  Today, I'm taking dabs of Durban Kush sauce from Contraband Concentrates.
[26:09.710 --> 26:14.710]  This is labeled as Durban Poison and I-95, cross to pre-98 Bubba Kush.
[26:14.710 --> 26:17.710]  I don't know if that's a blend or if that's actually a cross.
[26:17.710 --> 26:19.710]  It is labeled as sweet and sour.
[26:19.710 --> 26:23.710]  It is a cut above bread, selected and grown.
[26:23.710 --> 26:25.710]  This is really delicious concentrate.
[26:25.710 --> 26:27.710]  It kind of gives you that mind eraser sort of a thing.
[26:27.710 --> 26:29.710]  You go blank for a few minutes.
[26:29.710 --> 26:32.710]  It got Mike ridiculously high earlier today.
[26:32.710 --> 26:34.710]  There is a lab test printed on the container.
[26:34.970 --> 26:41.970]  It says THC A 902.9 milligrams, which equals 90.3%.
[26:41.970 --> 26:46.970]  The THC is 21.43 milligrams, which equals 2.1%.
[26:46.970 --> 26:49.970]  There are no other cannabinoids detected.
[26:49.970 --> 26:53.970]  The Durban Kush sauce from Contraband Concentrates, it's got me lit up.
[26:53.970 --> 26:56.970]  I really like this energetic, talkative buzz.
[26:56.970 --> 26:58.970]  This should be a fun podcast.
[26:58.970 --> 27:02.970]  This episode will be the second in a series of grow lessons.
[27:03.230 --> 27:09.230]  It will take us from the beginning of a grow all the way up to harvest and drying and curing our product.
[27:09.230 --> 27:15.230]  In the last episode, we talked a little bit about planning our grow and setting goals and finding ways to stay out of trouble.
[27:15.230 --> 27:21.230]  In this episode, we're going to focus more on planning the specific grow space.
[27:21.230 --> 27:24.230]  I've got a lot of details written down for this episode.
[27:24.230 --> 27:26.230]  I'm going to press pause.
[27:26.230 --> 27:28.230]  I'm going to take a quick drink.
[27:28.230 --> 27:30.230]  Of course, I'm going to take a bunch more dabs.
[27:30.490 --> 27:35.490]  When I come back, we'll take a deep dive into selecting and planning your grow space.
[27:44.770 --> 27:45.770]  All right, Podcast World.
[27:45.770 --> 27:49.770]  I am back and I am ready to talk about selecting your grow space.
[27:49.770 --> 27:51.770]  Let's get right into it.
[27:51.770 --> 27:57.770]  You can set up a grow almost anywhere if you can supply electricity, airflow, and water to that space.
[27:57.770 --> 28:01.770]  Where you choose to grow is going to determine a lot of your setup.
[28:01.770 --> 28:03.770]  We talked about this in the last episode.
[28:04.030 --> 28:09.030]  If you're in a small closet, you'll be very limited, but you'll still be able to produce a usable product.
[28:09.030 --> 28:15.030]  If you're in a prohibition state, you'll need to take extra precautions to keep the aroma down.
[28:15.030 --> 28:20.030]  Also, you'll need an excuse for the extra electrical consumption.
[28:21.030 --> 28:28.030]  Let me make a quick disclaimer that I cannot endorse, encourage, or promote you to conduct any sort of illegal activity.
[28:28.030 --> 28:31.030]  You've got to follow the laws and obey all of the rules.
[28:31.290 --> 28:42.290]  If you didn't listen to the last episode, please go back and listen to that long, passionate rant I gave about what will happen to you if you are suspected of having an illegal grow in your home.
[28:43.290 --> 28:44.290]  Now let's keep going.
[28:44.290 --> 28:51.290]  I recommend everyone do your best to minimize odor and obvious signs of a grow, even in legal environments.
[28:51.290 --> 28:58.290]  Thieves know how to spot a grow and you're entering a gray area that until recently has been run by criminals.
[28:58.550 --> 29:02.550]  You're planning to produce a high-value product and people want that product.
[29:02.550 --> 29:07.550]  If you tell somebody about that product, you are asking for trouble, so be careful.
[29:07.550 --> 29:10.550]  In the last episode, I talked about not bragging.
[29:10.550 --> 29:14.550]  Keep yourself protected by keeping your mouth shut.
[29:14.550 --> 29:17.550]  Now let's talk more about places to grow.
[29:17.550 --> 29:21.550]  We can grow in closets. We can grow in pre-made tents. We can grow in bedrooms.
[29:21.810 --> 29:24.810]  We can set up giant areas in basements.
[29:24.810 --> 29:27.810]  We can even use tiny spaces like our friends Love for the Plant and Love for the Bonk.
[29:27.810 --> 29:29.810]  They grow in little micro-grows.
[29:29.810 --> 29:39.810]  The size of your space and the pre-existing structure will dictate most of your setup, especially in a rental home and even more so in a prohibition environment.
[29:39.810 --> 29:47.810]  If you own your home, or if you're busting out the barn, or if you're building out a warehouse in a legal area, you have much more options.
[29:48.070 --> 29:55.070]  Ideal spaces for a grow are generally places with low traffic and something you can keep hidden from visitors.
[29:55.070 --> 29:57.070]  I like basements for home grows.
[29:57.070 --> 30:01.070]  Attics are okay, but they're harder to keep the climate dialed in.
[30:01.070 --> 30:08.070]  The sun is beating right on top of your grow space and the home heat rises, so attics are generally warmer places.
[30:08.070 --> 30:14.070]  Maybe my East Coast friends would have better luck in the attic, while the Colorado crew will get down in the basement better.
[30:14.330 --> 30:19.330]  Basements are usually insulated by the earth, so the temperature stays fairly cool.
[30:19.330 --> 30:25.330]  If you can isolate a small section or a room in the basement, that is usually my first choice.
[30:25.330 --> 30:30.330]  People won't be down in your basement unless you invite them, so it's easier to keep it secure.
[30:30.330 --> 30:41.330]  Now the only issue with basements is when you have to have a contractor come fix the water heater or the heater or some sort of plumbing down there, you may need to be prepared for visitors.
[30:41.590 --> 30:44.590]  Basements and attics are ideal in my opinion.
[30:44.590 --> 30:48.590]  Spare bedrooms are great if you have good control of your home.
[30:48.590 --> 30:56.590]  If you live with other people, you have to make sure that everyone is on the same page with the importance of security and light control in your grow rooms.
[30:56.590 --> 31:06.590]  If you live with other people and you've got a grow room and a spare bedroom, there's a good chance that when you're gone, when you're on a date, when you're asleep, they're going to take somebody in there and show off your grow.
[31:06.850 --> 31:07.850]  And they're going to do something weird.
[31:07.850 --> 31:09.850]  They're going to turn on the light during the night cycle.
[31:09.850 --> 31:12.850]  They're going to leave the overhead light on and not think about the light.
[31:12.850 --> 31:16.850]  The normal room light, when the grow lights go off, that normal light will stay on.
[31:16.850 --> 31:17.850]  They're going to screw it up.
[31:17.850 --> 31:25.850]  So have everybody in the house on the same page if you set up a grow in a shared home, in a shared room with other folks.
[31:25.850 --> 31:27.850]  So be careful with that sort of stuff.
[31:28.850 --> 31:33.850]  Another thing to think about is keeping children out of the grow without supervision.
[31:34.110 --> 31:36.110]  If you let your kids help, that's up to you as a parent.
[31:36.110 --> 31:37.110]  That's up to you as a caregiver.
[31:37.110 --> 31:39.110]  Maybe you're growing for the child.
[31:39.110 --> 31:43.110]  I think if you're growing for a child, it's great to have that child go in there and help with their medicine.
[31:43.110 --> 31:45.110]  They can build a relationship with it.
[31:45.110 --> 31:47.110]  I think that is a beautiful thing.
[31:47.110 --> 31:48.110]  That's up to you as a parent.
[31:48.110 --> 31:50.110]  You parent the way you feel you should do it.
[31:50.110 --> 31:55.110]  But keep the grow room locked and keep the kids out without supervision.
[31:55.110 --> 31:58.110]  I'd recommend a lock anyway just to make law enforcement happy.
[31:58.370 --> 32:05.370]  If anyone does come to inspect your legal grow, a lock just makes you look like you're trying to be more responsible.
[32:05.370 --> 32:06.370]  It looks good.
[32:06.370 --> 32:07.370]  It's an easy step to take.
[32:07.370 --> 32:08.370]  Do that.
[32:09.370 --> 32:13.370]  Garages and outbuildings are also great places for grows.
[32:13.370 --> 32:19.370]  Any space in which you can control the lights, the temperature, and humidity, you can turn into a grow.
[32:19.630 --> 32:29.630]  If you have a large space and you can't control the large area, you can buy a grow tent of almost any size and set that up in a room to create a more controllable environment.
[32:29.630 --> 32:36.630]  You can also set up multiple tents to have multiple cycles in the same basement or room area.
[32:36.630 --> 32:43.630]  You can have a veg area and two tents with alternating flower cycles to maximize the productivity of a basement grow.
[32:43.630 --> 32:47.630]  It's all about maximization once you get your room styled in.
[32:47.890 --> 32:53.890]  You can maximize a closet or a cabinet or a warehouse if you set it up correctly.
[32:53.890 --> 32:56.890]  Be sure to keep safety and security in mind.
[32:56.890 --> 32:58.890]  Is your new grow option safe?
[32:58.890 --> 32:59.890]  Is it secure?
[32:59.890 --> 33:04.890]  And once again, can you handle the consequences if you get yourself into trouble?
[33:04.890 --> 33:07.890]  Think about that now before we jump in.
[33:07.890 --> 33:11.890]  No matter where you set up your grow, there are a few things to keep in mind.
[33:12.150 --> 33:18.150]  The thing I feel is most commonly overlooked is the importance of airflow and air exchange.
[33:18.150 --> 33:21.150]  We need to exchange the air in a grow room.
[33:21.150 --> 33:30.150]  Imagine if I stuck you in a closet for 24 hours and I didn't open the door for any fresh air or to let out any of the gases that came from you.
[33:30.150 --> 33:37.150]  You'd be alive and you'd be a little uncomfortable and the air in that room would be so stale and funky that you just couldn't wait to get out.
[33:37.150 --> 33:39.150]  You'd be ready for some fresh air.
[33:39.150 --> 33:41.150]  The plants feel the same way.
[33:41.410 --> 33:44.410]  Plants uptake CO2 and release oxygen.
[33:44.410 --> 33:48.410]  So we have to think about where we're getting fresh CO2 from.
[33:48.410 --> 33:54.410]  And as the plants function, they release water vapor that increases the relative humidity of our grow space.
[33:54.410 --> 33:59.410]  So we have to have a plan to get rid of that excess humidity.
[33:59.410 --> 34:03.410]  Now as we remove the old air, we need to replace it with fresh air.
[34:03.410 --> 34:09.410]  In most small grows, you'll be able to replace the air probably with just the airflow that flows from underneath the door.
[34:09.670 --> 34:16.670]  If you've got a closet grow or a very small bedroom grow, you'll get enough air coming in through passive vents like underneath the door.
[34:16.670 --> 34:20.670]  Most of your grow tents will have passive vents built into the bottom.
[34:20.670 --> 34:22.670]  Utilize those.
[34:22.670 --> 34:34.670]  If you're using a powerful enough blower to extract the warm human air from the top of a grow space, you may need to add a passive intake to allow enough fresh air to flow into your space.
[34:34.670 --> 34:37.670]  So the major consideration is airflow.
[34:37.930 --> 34:40.930]  Can you get air in and out of your grow space?
[34:40.930 --> 34:44.930]  Now don't plan on leaving the door open as part of your plan.
[34:44.930 --> 34:46.930]  Because what about the dark cycle?
[34:46.930 --> 34:49.930]  You can't leave the door open during the dark cycle.
[34:49.930 --> 34:52.930]  And also what about those days when you're not home?
[34:52.930 --> 34:55.930]  Or what about that night when you get too stoned and fall asleep and forget?
[34:55.930 --> 35:00.930]  Don't rely on just leaving the door open as part of your HVAC plan.
[35:00.930 --> 35:02.930]  That is not going to work.
[35:02.930 --> 35:04.930]  That is not sufficient.
[35:04.930 --> 35:06.930]  Set yourself up for success.
[35:07.190 --> 35:09.190]  Give your garden a chance.
[35:09.190 --> 35:11.190]  And it will be so much more enjoyable.
[35:11.190 --> 35:12.190]  Don't make it stressful.
[35:12.190 --> 35:14.190]  Make it something you enjoy.
[35:14.190 --> 35:20.190]  Starting off with a shitty plan like trying to remember to close the door every night at 930, that's going to frustrate you in two weeks.
[35:20.190 --> 35:22.190]  Alright, so I've stressed the importance of airflow.
[35:22.190 --> 35:26.190]  Let's move forward and talk about electricity and power consumption.
[35:26.190 --> 35:32.190]  Can you safely provide electricity to your grow area without causing a fire hazard?
[35:32.450 --> 35:37.450]  Don't be that guy that burned down your house with a poorly designed grow.
[35:37.450 --> 35:41.450]  That makes the whole grow movement look bad and sets us all back five years.
[35:41.450 --> 35:43.450]  So please be careful.
[35:43.450 --> 35:51.450]  Can you power a grow light, a fan, an exhaust fan, maybe an air conditioner and whatever else you need for the grow space you choose?
[35:51.450 --> 36:01.450]  Don't pull too many amps from one breaker for too long because eventually something will melt and you will have a fire.
[36:01.710 --> 36:07.710]  If you flip a breaker more than two times a day, it is time to reconsider your electrical plan.
[36:07.710 --> 36:11.710]  Also, be prepared to pay for your electrical use.
[36:11.710 --> 36:18.710]  You won't have a crop for a few months, but you're going to have lights to pay for at the end of the first month.
[36:18.710 --> 36:20.710]  So be prepared for that bill.
[36:20.710 --> 36:26.710]  That's something a lot of young and new growers forget to plan ahead for.
[36:26.970 --> 36:34.970]  You hang up your grow light, you plug it in, you get shit running, you think, yeah, in like 90 to 120 days I'm going to harvest and have a bunch of money.
[36:34.970 --> 36:43.970]  And then in about 35 days, the bill comes and you go, oh shit, I got to pay a hundred extra dollars because I'm running this grow light and I didn't consider that.
[36:43.970 --> 36:45.970]  Plan ahead. There's a bill coming.
[36:45.970 --> 36:49.970]  Every month now, you've got a new bill to pay for that grow.
[36:49.970 --> 36:51.970]  Keep that in mind.
[36:52.230 --> 36:58.230]  If you are going to pull a lot of extra electricity, have a plan to tell the electric company why.
[36:58.230 --> 37:01.230]  You need an excuse. They may ask.
[37:01.230 --> 37:05.230]  Sometimes they call. Sometimes they send a letter.
[37:05.230 --> 37:10.230]  Sometimes they show up and walk around the house to check for inefficiencies.
[37:10.230 --> 37:12.230]  Be very careful.
[37:12.230 --> 37:17.230]  Also, law enforcement can use your electric bill as probable cause.
[37:17.490 --> 37:24.490]  With the new smart meters, they can probably tell exactly how many kilowatts you're using at exactly which point of the day.
[37:24.490 --> 37:31.490]  So they can probably tell that at 9 a.m. you start pulling 4,000 watts worth of extra power until 9 p.m.
[37:31.490 --> 37:32.490]  And then it turns off.
[37:32.490 --> 37:34.490]  They probably know when you're in flower.
[37:34.490 --> 37:36.490]  They probably know when you're in veg.
[37:36.490 --> 37:43.490]  Keep that sort of stuff in mind when you're building and designing your grow and also when you're selecting your lights and equipment.
[37:43.490 --> 37:46.490]  And we'll talk about choosing lighting in a future episode.
[37:46.750 --> 37:49.750]  Now the next thing we should consider is water.
[37:49.750 --> 37:51.750]  Can you get water to your grow area?
[37:51.750 --> 37:53.750]  Is your grow space in the attic?
[37:53.750 --> 37:56.750]  How are you going to get water to your attic?
[37:56.750 --> 38:00.750]  Are you going to fill up 5-gallon water bottles and huck them up that ladder?
[38:00.750 --> 38:04.750]  Or are you going to run a hose up there and hope you don't have a catastrophe with that?
[38:04.750 --> 38:05.750]  Be very careful.
[38:05.750 --> 38:07.750]  Either way, please.
[38:07.750 --> 38:09.750]  What if your grow is in the basement?
[38:09.750 --> 38:11.750]  Is there a tap down there in the basement?
[38:11.750 --> 38:13.750]  Do you have access to water?
[38:14.010 --> 38:16.010]  Think about where your water is coming from.
[38:16.010 --> 38:18.010]  Also, think about runoff water.
[38:18.010 --> 38:24.010]  You'll need to dispose of water occasionally, especially if you're running a hydro system.
[38:25.010 --> 38:27.010]  Does your basement have a floor drain?
[38:27.010 --> 38:32.010]  If it's got a floor drain, give it a test before you go pouring a whole bunch of water down there.
[38:32.010 --> 38:33.010]  Pour a half a gallon.
[38:33.010 --> 38:34.010]  See what happens.
[38:34.010 --> 38:35.010]  It doesn't clog up.
[38:35.010 --> 38:36.010]  Pour a gallon.
[38:36.010 --> 38:38.010]  Pour two.
[38:38.270 --> 38:39.270]  Be patient.
[38:39.270 --> 38:43.270]  Sometimes those floor drains are backed up way down the line.
[38:43.270 --> 38:47.270]  You have to pour a bunch of water in there and then suddenly it overflows into your floor.
[38:47.270 --> 38:49.270]  Don't think you're going to pour a big reservoir down there.
[38:49.270 --> 38:51.270]  Don't think you're going to drain your hydro gear down there.
[38:51.270 --> 38:52.270]  Be very careful.
[38:52.270 --> 38:55.270]  Test that floor drain before you rely on it too much.
[38:55.270 --> 38:59.270]  You may also need to think about extra water consumption.
[38:59.270 --> 39:01.270]  It depends on how big your grow is.
[39:01.270 --> 39:03.270]  It depends on how much they're paying attention.
[39:03.270 --> 39:07.270]  It depends on if you pay the water bill or if the landlord pays the water bill.
[39:07.530 --> 39:09.530]  This just may be something to consider.
[39:10.530 --> 39:14.530]  Since we're talking about water, I'm going to mention get a good shop vac.
[39:14.530 --> 39:17.530]  You're going to have to get water to your grow on a daily basis.
[39:17.530 --> 39:24.530]  I use about five gallons of water per light, per day, maybe every other day when the plants are smaller.
[39:25.530 --> 39:29.530]  Think about how much water you're going to need while you're planning your grow space.
[39:29.530 --> 39:35.530]  Do you really think you want to huck a five gallon container of water up that attic ladder for nine weeks?
[39:35.790 --> 39:41.790]  If you're not a medical marijuana patient now, you will be by the end of that grow cycle.
[39:42.790 --> 39:48.790]  Another thing we really need to think about when planning our grow space is darkness and light control.
[39:49.790 --> 39:53.790]  Can you make your space completely dark during your dark cycle?
[39:53.790 --> 39:56.790]  I don't mean dark to where it's kind of dark.
[39:56.790 --> 39:58.790]  I don't mean dark where there's a little bit of light.
[39:58.790 --> 40:01.790]  I mean dark to where it is scary dark.
[40:02.790 --> 40:04.790]  I mean zero light.
[40:05.050 --> 40:11.050]  Lay in your grow space for five or ten minutes with your eyes open and let your eyes adjust to that total darkness.
[40:12.050 --> 40:14.050]  Then wave your hand in front of your face.
[40:14.050 --> 40:17.050]  If you can see your hand at all, it is too light in there.
[40:17.050 --> 40:19.050]  We need absolute total darkness.
[40:19.050 --> 40:23.050]  Any light will potentially cause your plants to have issues.
[40:24.050 --> 40:29.050]  If your plants have light during their supposed night cycle, they might not even begin to flower.
[40:29.050 --> 40:32.050]  You may think you're in flower and you're still vegging.
[40:32.310 --> 40:36.310]  They may be getting just enough light to where they're kind of flowering but they're still kind of vegging.
[40:36.310 --> 40:40.310]  They're looking really weird and they start taking on weird shapes and their leaves get strange.
[40:40.310 --> 40:41.310]  You could have that.
[40:41.310 --> 40:47.310]  Or if you've got a very small light leak, the area that is getting hit by that light will make hermaphrodite flowers.
[40:48.310 --> 40:53.310]  That will pollinate little sections of the room and you'll have little seeds in your buds.
[40:53.310 --> 40:59.310]  We need an area that we can keep absolutely dark during our dark cycle.
[40:59.570 --> 41:02.570]  Something that won't get interrupted by somebody needing to use the bathroom.
[41:02.570 --> 41:05.570]  Something that won't get interrupted by somebody needing to do laundry.
[41:05.570 --> 41:09.570]  Something that won't get interrupted by somebody going out to the garage to do something.
[41:09.570 --> 41:15.570]  Think ahead of all of the reasons somebody may need to go in your grow area.
[41:15.570 --> 41:21.570]  That's why I like a little grow tent or an isolated room or the back corner of the basement where nobody ever goes.
[41:22.570 --> 41:28.570]  Those are the major things to think about when building your grow and selecting your grow space.
[41:28.830 --> 41:30.830]  You want somewhere discreet and secure.
[41:30.830 --> 41:36.830]  You need to be able to control temperature and humidity within a very tight range.
[41:36.830 --> 41:43.830]  We want to get about 77 degrees with about 40% humidity in our flower rooms.
[41:43.830 --> 41:45.830]  You want to be able to dial that in.
[41:45.830 --> 41:49.830]  You need somewhere with adequate power and available water.
[41:49.830 --> 41:53.830]  You also may need an excuse for the extra consumption.
[41:53.830 --> 41:57.830]  Another very important factor we keep talking about is light control.
[41:58.090 --> 42:00.090]  We can't have light interruptions in our grow.
[42:00.090 --> 42:04.090]  We need to keep our light scheduled perfectly.
[42:04.090 --> 42:07.090]  The dark cycle is super critical during flowering.
[42:07.090 --> 42:10.090]  It cannot be interrupted by the tiniest amount of light.
[42:10.090 --> 42:12.090]  I can't stress that enough.
[42:12.090 --> 42:17.090]  Like I said earlier, grow tents work great because somebody can't walk into the room
[42:17.090 --> 42:22.090]  and flip on the switch for the light that's in the room and accidentally get light in that grow tent
[42:22.090 --> 42:24.090]  if you've got it closed up properly.
[42:24.090 --> 42:26.090]  Don't leave it open for air flow.
[42:26.350 --> 42:28.350]  Like I talked about leaving the grow room door open earlier,
[42:28.350 --> 42:33.350]  don't leave your grow tent open and get too stoned or get way too into a game of fork knife.
[42:33.350 --> 42:38.350]  And totally forget that those lights went off at 7 and you left that room open and now it's 830
[42:38.350 --> 42:40.350]  and you're freaking out.
[42:40.350 --> 42:41.350]  Don't let that shit happen.
[42:41.350 --> 42:45.350]  As long as you close the grow tent, you should be safe from light interruptions.
[42:45.350 --> 42:50.350]  I feel like I covered a lot of the basics of selecting your grow space.
[42:50.350 --> 42:55.350]  Think about your needs and your goals and try to find a space that works the best for you.
[42:55.610 --> 42:59.610]  As long as you can provide the essentials, you can make any space work.
[42:59.610 --> 43:03.610]  I've grown in that little mini closet underneath the stairs in an apartment.
[43:03.610 --> 43:07.610]  I've grown in a sketchy attic in a garage in Kansas.
[43:07.610 --> 43:10.610]  I've grown in a spare bedroom in Bessemer.
[43:10.610 --> 43:15.610]  And I've busted out basements with somewhere between 2 and 12 lights depending on the basement.
[43:15.610 --> 43:20.610]  I've also grown in giant warehouses and I've done a lot of growing in grow tents.
[43:20.870 --> 43:26.870]  The needs are the same in all of those spaces and a little planning and thought can make your tiny space
[43:26.870 --> 43:31.870]  produce the same quality as commercial grows if done wisely.
[43:31.870 --> 43:36.870]  Don't let anybody talk down to you for growing in a grow tent.
[43:36.870 --> 43:42.870]  Set your finished product next to their finished product and ask them if it was grown in a big room,
[43:42.870 --> 43:44.870]  in a warehouse or in a tent.
[43:45.130 --> 43:51.130]  It doesn't matter as long as you are producing a product that makes you happy and meets your demands.
[43:51.130 --> 43:55.130]  That's the important part. Don't let anybody talk shit to you about the way you grow.
[43:55.130 --> 43:59.130]  Like we said last time, you're only doing it wrong if the plants die.
[43:59.130 --> 44:03.130]  Now let's move forward a little bit. Something I want to mention is cleanliness.
[44:03.130 --> 44:10.130]  If you set up in a basement or a spare room, try to get anything not grow related out of that space.
[44:10.130 --> 44:14.130]  I would recommend a solid cleaning of any space before setting up.
[44:14.390 --> 44:19.390]  If the space has a funky, dingy smell, like if you're in a basement and it's got that basement smell,
[44:19.390 --> 44:23.390]  try to find the cause of that. What's down there making it funky?
[44:23.390 --> 44:29.390]  Can you get rid of it? Then maybe get a bunch of fresh air through that space for a little while before you set up.
[44:29.390 --> 44:33.390]  Maybe open some windows, get some fans going, spray some ozium in there.
[44:33.390 --> 44:39.390]  Just try to get rid of that funky smell because that smell could stick to your buds.
[44:39.650 --> 44:44.650]  You don't want to grow in a funky space and then you don't want your product to end up smelling like funky basement.
[44:44.650 --> 44:50.650]  It will if your space has that funk, especially if you're going to dry and cure in a funky basement.
[44:50.650 --> 44:55.650]  Try to get rid of that funky basement smell. You can do that just by getting air into the room.
[44:55.650 --> 45:00.650]  Get a little airflow going. Get that old funky air out of there. That'll really help you out.
[45:00.650 --> 45:08.650]  Earlier I said to clean the room. Everything in a room is a spot for a spider mite or a pest to hang out and hide.
[45:08.910 --> 45:13.910]  Every little spot. If you got some clothes in there, that's a beautiful spot for a bunch of bugs just to hang out.
[45:13.910 --> 45:20.910]  Just try to clean up the space and have a nice tidy grow space. It'll help you keep everything organized and it'll help you keep bugs away.
[45:20.910 --> 45:26.910]  Find a good space. Make sure it's safe. Make sure you can get a lot of airflow to the area.
[45:26.910 --> 45:33.910]  Make sure you can get water to the area. If you're going to provide supplemental CO2 to your grow space,
[45:34.170 --> 45:39.170]  make sure you can carry CO2 tanks to the area. Those tanks are heavy.
[45:39.170 --> 45:45.170]  Make sure you can control the lights in your grow space and also the darkness in your grow space.
[45:45.170 --> 45:50.170]  Be sure that you can control the flow of human traffic in your grow area.
[45:50.170 --> 45:54.170]  Also, you don't want your pets down there. I do not encourage people taking their animals to the grow.
[45:54.170 --> 45:58.170]  I see it a lot. If you want your pet in the grow, that's on you. I do not encourage it.
[45:58.430 --> 46:02.430]  They go play in the yard. They're picking up pests probably from every plant in the yard.
[46:02.430 --> 46:05.430]  They're bringing it right into your grow. I don't encourage that.
[46:05.430 --> 46:10.430]  But you do what makes you happy. Like I said, you're only doing it wrong when the plants die.
[46:10.430 --> 46:14.430]  So the next step is to make sure this is something you want to do.
[46:14.430 --> 46:22.430]  And then we will talk about selecting specific equipment for your specific grow in the next episode.
[46:22.690 --> 46:28.690]  I want to thank you guys for listening to the second episode in a very long series of grow lessons.

[48:13.730 --> 48:16.730]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[48:16.730 --> 48:20.730]  It's time for episode 354 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[48:20.730 --> 48:24.730]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[48:24.730 --> 48:29.730]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[48:29.730 --> 48:33.730]  And you can find them at dankseed.store.
[48:33.730 --> 48:38.730]  It seems to have become tradition that I start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[48:38.990 --> 48:44.990]  Today, I'm taking dabs of the Blueberry Citron Fambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[48:44.990 --> 48:51.990]  On the last episode, I described the flavor as oranges rolled in sugar with a hint of purple Laffy Taffys.
[48:51.990 --> 48:54.990]  I really enjoy this concentrate. I've got a lot of it.
[48:54.990 --> 48:57.990]  So we'll be smoking this for a couple of episodes.
[48:57.990 --> 49:02.990]  This is going to be the third episode in my long series of grow lessons.
[49:02.990 --> 49:07.990]  In the past two episodes, we talked a little bit about setting goals and planning your grow.
[49:08.250 --> 49:12.250]  This time, we talked more specifically about selecting and planning your space.
[49:12.250 --> 49:19.250]  In this episode, we're going to focus more in on the equipment and choosing the appropriate equipment for your grow.
[49:19.250 --> 49:22.250]  We need the right equipment for the size of your grow.
[49:22.250 --> 49:24.250]  We need the right equipment to meet your goals.
[49:24.250 --> 49:28.250]  And we need the right equipment to meet our power consumption limits.
[49:28.250 --> 49:33.250]  So let's get into a podcast all about selecting equipment for your new grow.
[49:33.510 --> 49:38.510]  In a previous episode, we talked about selecting your space and thinking about your goals.
[49:38.510 --> 49:43.510]  Your space is really going to dictate how much light you can put in there.
[49:43.510 --> 49:49.510]  Your amount of electricity available is really going to dictate how much gear we put in there.
[49:49.510 --> 49:56.510]  Try to keep these things in mind and have realistic expectations of your garden while we're designing and building your new grow.
[49:56.510 --> 49:58.510]  Now let's talk about selecting lighting.
[49:58.770 --> 50:03.770]  Lighting is probably the number one decision to make when designing a new grow.
[50:03.770 --> 50:07.770]  If you've got a small closet or a very small cupboard area,
[50:07.770 --> 50:13.770]  your lighting options are going to be limited to smaller, lower-powered lights that don't put off a lot of heat.
[50:13.770 --> 50:20.770]  But that's okay. As long as they light your small space appropriately, you don't need a gigantic light in there.
[50:21.030 --> 50:29.030]  For a small closet or a cupboard or something that's been converted into a grow space like a dresser or an armoire or a storage cabinet
[50:29.030 --> 50:34.030]  or something that's kind of incognito, something like our friends at Love for the Plant would create,
[50:34.030 --> 50:38.030]  if you're running a small space, maybe a T5 light would work in there.
[50:38.030 --> 50:43.030]  If you want to upgrade from a T5, your next best option is an LED.
[50:43.030 --> 50:48.030]  LEDs are great for small spaces. LED technology has come a long way.
[50:48.290 --> 50:55.290]  I do not have a lot of personal experience with LEDs. I also don't have a lot of experience in small spaces.
[50:55.290 --> 51:01.290]  I have seen LEDs kill it in little spaces. They do very well for small home grows.
[51:01.290 --> 51:06.290]  If you've got an apartment or somewhere where you can't take up a lot of power, an LED is a great option.
[51:06.290 --> 51:17.290]  And it works great in a closet, in a cupboard, or in a small piece of furniture that has been converted into your little secret home grow space that's hidden right there in plain sight.
[51:17.550 --> 51:23.550]  So a T5 light is probably like your beginner light, your lowest powered light that I would recommend growing cannabis with.
[51:23.550 --> 51:29.550]  Then you've got your LED lights. So if you've got a small space, a T5 or an LED may work for you.
[51:29.550 --> 51:36.550]  Then we work our way into something like a tent or a small enclosure that we have built or maybe a mini room that we have sectioned off.
[51:36.550 --> 51:43.550]  That's when you can work your way into either more or larger T5s, more or larger LEDs.
[51:43.810 --> 51:46.810]  You can get more of them or you can get higher powered LEDs.
[51:46.810 --> 51:50.810]  Or there are also ceramic metal halide lights.
[51:50.810 --> 51:55.810]  Ceramic metal halides are great in the same way that LEDs are because they don't put off a lot of heat.
[51:55.810 --> 52:00.810]  The T5s, the LEDs, and the ceramic metal halides are going to be fairly low heat.
[52:00.810 --> 52:06.810]  There is heat, but not as much as you're going to get from the high intensity discharge lighting that we're going to talk about here in just a minute.
[52:06.810 --> 52:10.810]  So the T5s, the LEDs, and the ceramic metal halide are great for a tent.
[52:11.070 --> 52:12.070]  They don't put off a lot of heat.
[52:12.070 --> 52:15.070]  They also do not consume a lot of electricity.
[52:15.070 --> 52:19.070]  So if you are limited on electrical consumption, those are great options.
[52:19.070 --> 52:26.070]  Another advantage of the T5s, the LEDs, and the ceramic metal halide is that since they don't put off so much heat on their own,
[52:26.070 --> 52:31.070]  you don't have to buy more cooling equipment to plug in and use even more electricity.
[52:31.070 --> 52:33.070]  So it's kind of a win-win with those.
[52:33.070 --> 52:40.070]  However, I don't feel like they put out the same harvest weight that a high intensity discharge light will put out.
[52:40.330 --> 52:45.330]  If you're limited on space and limited on electrical consumption and you're not able to cool it,
[52:45.330 --> 52:49.330]  those smaller lights are absolutely the way to go.
[52:49.330 --> 52:53.330]  So now let's talk a little bit about high intensity discharge lighting.
[52:53.330 --> 53:00.330]  And I'm not going to focus too much on any specific kind of lighting or brand because I'm not here to really sell you any type of product.
[53:00.330 --> 53:07.330]  I want to give you guidance on the things that you may want to pay attention to while you're thinking about building your grow.
[53:07.590 --> 53:11.590]  I'm not going to pitch you specific stuff because that's up to you to decide.
[53:11.590 --> 53:18.590]  I want you to customize your grow, but I'm going to give you a really good blueprint and a really good idea of how to get to your goal.
[53:18.590 --> 53:21.590]  So let's talk more about high intensity discharge lighting.
[53:21.590 --> 53:26.590]  High intensity discharge lighting is like a high pressure sodium or a metal halide bulb.
[53:26.590 --> 53:29.590]  They are powered by a ballast that you plug into the wall.
[53:29.590 --> 53:34.590]  That ballast generates more power to power that large high intensity discharge bulb.
[53:34.850 --> 53:39.850]  They put off a lot of light and a lot of heat as well.
[53:39.850 --> 53:42.850]  I've seen 250 watt high pressure sodium bulbs.
[53:42.850 --> 53:46.850]  I'm sure they make smaller, but I've never seen it offered in a grow store or anything.
[53:46.850 --> 53:47.850]  I've never looked for it.
[53:47.850 --> 53:54.850]  I have used and seen a 250, 400 watt high pressure sodium and metal halides are very common.
[53:54.850 --> 53:58.850]  600s are fairly common and thousands are the industry standard.
[53:59.110 --> 54:05.110]  If you're using high intensity discharge lighting in a commercial facility, they're probably 1000 watt lights.
[54:05.110 --> 54:09.110]  They're probably double ended gavitas, which is a whole step up.
[54:09.110 --> 54:13.110]  We'll talk about that a little bit later when we get into the warehouse environment.
[54:13.110 --> 54:19.110]  But if you've got a tent, you can use the T5s, you can use LEDs, you can use ceramic metal halides,
[54:19.110 --> 54:24.110]  or you can work your way into a small high intensity discharge light.
[54:24.110 --> 54:27.110]  You can use a 250 in a small tent, maybe a three by three.
[54:27.370 --> 54:28.370]  I wouldn't go any larger.
[54:28.370 --> 54:35.370]  You can use anything from a 400 to 1000 watt high intensity discharge light in a five by five tent.
[54:35.370 --> 54:39.370]  And you should be okay if you learn how to control the temperature properly.
[54:39.370 --> 54:41.370]  You're going to need to duct the light.
[54:41.370 --> 54:43.370]  And in a moment, we will talk about ducted lighting.
[54:43.370 --> 54:47.370]  So if you're going with the tent, you can use T5 lights.
[54:47.370 --> 54:51.370]  T5s, you got to get them real close to the plant to get a lot of real productive growth.
[54:51.370 --> 54:53.370]  And it takes a lot of them.
[54:53.630 --> 54:59.630]  T5s, I wouldn't recommend it unless you absolutely are on a low budget for lights and power consumption.
[54:59.630 --> 55:03.630]  LEDs are very brand and style specific.
[55:03.630 --> 55:07.630]  You have to learn the light you've got and the plants you've got together.
[55:07.630 --> 55:13.630]  I don't have enough experience with the LEDs, but I've seen some kick ass product come from LED lighting.
[55:13.630 --> 55:16.630]  They also don't put out a lot of heat and they don't use up a lot of electricity.
[55:16.630 --> 55:19.630]  So that's great in a tent or a small room environment.
[55:19.890 --> 55:23.890]  The ceramic metal halides are very similar to the LEDs.
[55:23.890 --> 55:25.890]  They don't use a lot of power. They don't put off a lot of heat.
[55:25.890 --> 55:29.890]  And you get a quality product that should make you happy.
[55:29.890 --> 55:33.890]  Those are going to be fairly easy to cool in a small space, in a small tent.
[55:33.890 --> 55:37.890]  Then if we work our way into the small, high intensity discharge lighting,
[55:37.890 --> 55:42.890]  that's when you have to start thinking about cooling the room much more efficiently.
[55:42.890 --> 55:46.890]  You have to think about getting that heat out and getting fresh air into the room.
[55:47.150 --> 55:50.150]  That's when you start thinking about ducted lights or open lights.
[55:50.150 --> 55:52.150]  We're going to talk about that more in a second.
[55:52.150 --> 55:57.150]  But just keep in mind for now that the bigger light we use, the more cooling we're going to have to focus on.
[55:57.150 --> 55:59.150]  Which will be more electricity.
[55:59.150 --> 56:02.150]  So you're pulling a bigger light and now you're adding more cooling.
[56:02.150 --> 56:05.150]  So you're doubling up your electrical load. Keep that in mind.
[56:05.150 --> 56:09.150]  Now let's move from a larger space, from a one light situation,
[56:09.150 --> 56:15.150]  to maybe a two or four light situation where we've got a larger tent or maybe a dedicated room.
[56:15.410 --> 56:17.410]  Let's talk about our lighting options there.
[56:17.410 --> 56:19.410]  This is where I would move away from the T5s.
[56:19.410 --> 56:22.410]  I wouldn't consider a T5 if you're doing this much.
[56:22.410 --> 56:26.410]  You're just wasting light, you're wasting electricity, you're not going to see production.
[56:26.410 --> 56:28.410]  If you've got four lights, you need production.
[56:28.410 --> 56:29.410]  Let's hang up some real lights.
[56:29.410 --> 56:31.410]  You can go with LEDs. Get a quality LED.
[56:31.410 --> 56:34.410]  Something with high output. Not a little starter LED.
[56:34.410 --> 56:36.410]  You need a good one if you're going this route.
[56:36.410 --> 56:39.410]  Or multiple ceramic metal halide lights.
[56:39.410 --> 56:42.410]  You can place them closer together because they don't take as much electricity.
[56:42.670 --> 56:45.670]  You can have more of them. You can cover more of a footprint.
[56:45.670 --> 56:52.670]  I think they cover about a 3x3, maybe a 4x4 area for the 315 ceramic metal halide.
[56:52.670 --> 56:56.670]  Your LED light is going to be very light and brand specific.
[56:56.670 --> 56:58.670]  It should tell you what the footprint covers on there.
[56:58.670 --> 57:01.670]  Go a little smaller than that and I think you'll be happy.
[57:01.670 --> 57:04.670]  So for a room, step away from the T5s.
[57:04.670 --> 57:06.670]  Maybe get a high powered LED.
[57:06.670 --> 57:08.670]  Maybe multiple ceramic metal halides.
[57:08.930 --> 57:17.930]  Or in a room, this is where we can start using multiple 600 and or multiple 1000W high intensity discharge lights.
[57:17.930 --> 57:21.930]  I think I've kind of covered the pros and cons of the LEDs and the ceramic metal halides.
[57:21.930 --> 57:23.930]  They don't use a lot of electricity.
[57:23.930 --> 57:24.930]  They don't make a lot of heat.
[57:24.930 --> 57:27.930]  But they also don't put out like a high intensity discharge light.
[57:27.930 --> 57:34.930]  So now let's talk about the differences between a 600 and 1000W high pressure sodium bulb for flowering.
[57:35.190 --> 57:40.190]  With two 600s, you can cover a little more space with less shadow.
[57:40.190 --> 57:46.190]  With 1000W, you can cover a really nice space with a whole lot of light.
[57:46.190 --> 57:47.190]  So it's kind of up to you.
[57:47.190 --> 57:51.190]  Do you want to run two 6s or do you want to run 1000?
[57:51.190 --> 57:52.190]  Keep in mind the height.
[57:52.190 --> 57:53.190]  How much height you've got.
[57:53.190 --> 57:56.190]  If your ceiling is low, go with the 600s.
[57:56.190 --> 57:59.190]  If you're not able to do a lot of cooling, go with the 600s.
[57:59.190 --> 58:03.190]  Think about 600W lights or 1000W lights when you're planning your grow.
[58:03.450 --> 58:10.450]  The 600W high pressure sodium light will be more efficient if you're trying to decide between a 600 and a 1000.
[58:10.450 --> 58:14.450]  But the 1000 is going to push your plants just a little bit more.
[58:14.450 --> 58:21.450]  Now earlier what I said about shadows, what I mean is if you've got a 1000W bulb coming from right above all of your plants,
[58:21.450 --> 58:26.450]  you've got one source of light, you're going to create shadows because you only have light coming from one direction.
[58:26.450 --> 58:31.450]  If you have two 6s that are just a little bit apart, you've got light coming from two directions.
[58:31.710 --> 58:39.710]  So that will give you less shadows, more of your buds will get light, and that is actually a little more efficient than one bulb and a bunch of shadows.
[58:39.710 --> 58:45.710]  Now is probably a good time to start thinking about open or ducted light reflectors.
[58:45.710 --> 58:52.710]  Just to be clear about what I'm talking about, when we hang up our grow lights, that enclosure is known as the reflector.
[58:52.710 --> 58:56.710]  Then we screw the bulb into the socket and cord set.
[58:56.970 --> 59:01.970]  That runs to the ballast, the ballast plugs into, it's got another cord that plugs into the wall.
[59:01.970 --> 59:07.970]  So that reflector, they are available in tons of different styles at this point.
[59:07.970 --> 59:11.970]  Right now let's think about vented or open.
[59:11.970 --> 59:19.970]  Do you want a light that's got glass between your grow and the bulb so that it keeps that heat in there and we can set up ducting to move that heat out of the room?
[59:20.230 --> 59:26.230]  Or do you want to allow that heat from the bulb to enter the grow room and combat that with air conditioning?
[59:26.230 --> 59:28.230]  Both are reasonable options.
[59:28.230 --> 59:30.230]  Both have their pros and cons.
[59:30.230 --> 59:35.230]  Not ducting your lights means that you've got to cool that room.
[59:35.230 --> 59:38.230]  That means you've got to add air conditioning.
[59:38.230 --> 59:41.230]  We'll talk about air conditioning options in just a minute.
[59:41.490 --> 59:53.490]  Now if you do choose to vent your lights, make sure you run the ducting to where none of the odor from your grow is going to make it out of wherever that air is being expelled from your area.
[59:53.490 --> 59:58.490]  We don't need to blow that hot cannabis aroma right into the neighbor's bedroom window.
[59:58.490 --> 01:00:00.490]  So think about that when you're setting up your grow.
[01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:04.490]  We'll talk about carbon filters and odor control here in just a minute.
[01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:08.490]  So think about if you want to duct and have cooled lights or if you want to have open lights.
[01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:15.750]  If you've got ducted vented lights, there will be a piece of glass between the bulb and your plants that needs to stay clean.
[01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.750]  Also, that means more equipment.
[01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.750]  That means we need a powerful blower.
[01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:27.750]  We need some ducting and we need something running out of the grow space, possibly out of the house, which is going to need to be camouflaged and taken care of discreetly.
[01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:30.750]  The advantage to ducting your lights is less cooling.
[01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.750]  You're not going to need as much air conditioning.
[01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:37.750]  You're going to need one blower to blow over the lights to get that hot air out of there.
[01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:45.010]  If that hot air is going out of the house or out of your building, you need carbon filtration, which we're going to talk about in just a minute.
[01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:49.010]  So back in the day, most home grows were designed with ducted lights.
[01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:54.010]  Most commercial grows, however, do not use vented or ducted lights.
[01:00:54.010 --> 01:01:01.010]  We use gavitas, which are hung really high because we need them about three feet, maybe more, from the canopy because they do get really hot.
[01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:08.270]  They are so intense, not just from heat, but so intense from light that they can cause burn and wrinkle and bleaching on the tips of the plants.
[01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:12.270]  So in a commercial environment, we use non-ducted lighting.
[01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:16.270]  In a home grow, it is very common to see the ducted lighting.
[01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:22.270]  A lot of home grows now, a lot of guys are going hard and they're actually hanging up the lower wattage gavitas.
[01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:26.270]  They're hanging up the gavita 750s and I'm seeing great success with that.
[01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:36.530]  You will need to know how to trellis and control the height of your canopy if you plan on using gavitas in a basement or in a bedroom, unless you've got extremely high ceilings.
[01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:39.530]  So for a home grow, here's a quick, just a quick breakdown of how I would do it.
[01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:44.530]  It would go carbon filter and I would have the appropriate carbon filter for the size of my room.
[01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:50.530]  Then I would have a blower and I would have an appropriate blower to go with that carbon filter.
[01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:55.530]  Either a six inch or an eight inch, maybe a 10, maybe a 12, depending on the size of the grow and how many lights.
[01:01:55.790 --> 01:02:01.790]  Then possibly a Y, I'd have a piece of ducting that sits on my blower that maybe goes to a Y.
[01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:10.790]  If I'm running four or six lights, I will do the Y and I will run three lights parallel or two lights parallel to where it goes.
[01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:15.790]  Carbon filter, blower, Y duct, then coming off of each side of the Y, we've got a little ducting.
[01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:19.790]  Then we've got a vented light, a little more ducting, a vented light.
[01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:27.050]  Then those two ducts, sometimes they come together. Sometimes I don't put them back together, depending on where I'm exiting with that ducting.
[01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:33.050]  Then they go out of the grow area, whether out of the house, whether out of the building, just depends on where I am.
[01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:37.050]  Maybe it goes out of the room into another room or it's taken care of there.
[01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:45.050]  But it goes carbon filter, blower, maybe a Y, maybe not, and then lights, and then maybe back together, maybe not, and then out.
[01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:51.310]  At the end there, it's always a good idea to have something to prevent other things from climbing into the grow.
[01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:55.310]  You don't want to get a mouse that feels a bunch of warm air coming out of there in the middle of the night and he's like,
[01:02:55.310 --> 01:03:02.310]  oh look, a little warm duct and a mouse or a lizard or somebody, possibly a snake, climbs right into your ducting, ends up in your grow light, cooks itself,
[01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:06.310]  maybe makes it all the way to the blower, shreds itself. I don't know what could happen.
[01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:11.310]  Put something on the end there. It may sound crazy. A pair of pantyhose works beautifully.
[01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:16.570]  You can buy local Walgreens or whatever. You may look like a weirdo if you're a big dude, but buy a couple of pair of black pantyhose.
[01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:23.570]  And then just like a condom, stretch them over the end of your ducting, secure it with some duct tape, and that way nothing can climb up in the end there.
[01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:30.570]  They do sell more expensive options to put at the end of your ducting, but pantyhose will work just fine if you use a couple of layers.
[01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:34.570]  And here's a really random piece of advice while I'm thinking about it.
[01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:47.830]  If you have got that end going outside, you're going to have to put some bends in your ducting to prevent light from coming down that ducting during your dark cycle if there is light outside.
[01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:57.830]  So you've got that ducting that goes, it's a carbon filter, blower, ducting, light, ducting, maybe another light, maybe more ducting, then out of the house, right?
[01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:06.090]  So imagine the sun comes up and your lights aren't on yet. If that sun is shining toward the direction of that duct, it'll shine light right down that ducting and it's reflective on the inside.
[01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:11.090]  So it's going to bounce through there and end up into your grow room and it'll come out of the lights looking just like a grow light.
[01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:17.090]  It'll be a low-powered grow light, but it'll be coming out and the plants will think it's daytime because that sun is awesome.
[01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:20.090]  That sun will tell them, wake up little ladies, and they will.
[01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:27.350]  So you've got to prevent that. Put some sort of a light baffle outside and also bend the ducting on the inside to prevent that.
[01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:33.350]  Go in there and turn off the lights in your grow and just hang out and see if it is totally dark in there.
[01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:41.350]  We talked about this in another episode. If you can see your hand in front of your face at all, it is too dark. We need absolute darkness in the grow.
[01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:47.350]  So that's a lot of talk about ducted or vented lights and non-vented or open lights.
[01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:53.610]  They've both got their pros and cons, but the lighting you decide may dictate a lot of the rest of your setup.
[01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:56.610]  So be careful when you choose your lighting.
[01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:59.610]  Now let's talk about moving into larger spaces.
[01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:05.610]  If you've got a barn or an outbuilding with high ceilings and a lot of electrical availability,
[01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:10.610]  then I would recommend moving into double-ended bulb technology.
[01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:16.610]  They are much more high output. They do put off a lot more heat, but the plants will definitely show you the difference.
[01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:21.870]  I can pull about 3 pounds per light consistently from a double-ended bulb.
[01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:25.870]  Now I know earlier I said I would try not to talk about brands and pitch brands to you,
[01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:33.870]  but the industry standard for the double-ended horticultural bulb in a Colorado commercial grow facility is of course the Goveda.
[01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:41.870]  So I try not to recommend too many brands to you, but I'll tell you straight up, I would use the Govedas if I were going to build a large grow right now.
[01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:43.870]  As many of them as I can fit.
[01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:48.130]  I want about 1 Goveda per 4x4 or 5x5 foot space.
[01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:53.130]  So for a warehouse or a commercial environment or maybe a large barn with high ceilings,
[01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:56.130]  I would always recommend the double-ended technology.
[01:05:56.130 --> 01:05:58.130]  Of course I would recommend a Goveda.
[01:05:58.130 --> 01:06:01.130]  However, they do produce a lot of heat.
[01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:04.130]  You're going to need more cooling if you're using Govedas.
[01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:06.130]  Also, you need those high ceilings.
[01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:13.130]  I recommend you keep your Goveda lights about 3 feet, maybe more, from the top of your plants.
[01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:19.390]  Unless you've got some serious cooling, you want those lights about 3 feet away from the top of your canopy.
[01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:20.390]  So think about that.
[01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:24.390]  By the end of flower, if you've got big giant buds, you still need 3 foot of space,
[01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:28.390]  or you're going to start burning and bleaching the tips of your plants.
[01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:32.390]  Now for veg, you can use whatever kind of light you're comfortable with vegging.
[01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:34.390]  T5s work for small plants.
[01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:39.390]  LEDs and ceramic metal halides will definitely work for veg for smaller plants.
[01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:43.650]  If you're trying to get into a commercial grow, I would recommend 400s, 600s if you can,
[01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:46.650]  or even just veg under your 1000s.
[01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:49.650]  Or in a commercial environment, try to veg under Govedas.
[01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:53.650]  They make metal halide and high-pressure sodium bulbs for your Govedas.
[01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:58.650]  And just because I know somebody is going to ask, for vegging, we prefer metal halide bulbs.
[01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:00.650]  You want more of the blue spectrum for veg.
[01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.650]  That keeps your plants shorter and helps them root.
[01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:06.650]  For flowering, we want high-pressure sodium.
[01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:08.650]  That's more of a orange and red spectrum.
[01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:11.910]  That's going to give you bigger fruits and more growth.
[01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:15.910]  So, metal halide for veg, high-pressure sodium for flower.
[01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:18.910]  Way different spectrums are going to be available for your LED lighting.
[01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:22.910]  Check out your specific light manufacturer's options.
[01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:26.910]  There are so many options for LEDs that I cannot even get specific, you guys.
[01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:29.910]  So, let's quickly recap lighting.
[01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:33.910]  If you're in a tent or a small space, T5s are a good option.
[01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:35.910]  LEDs will work for you.
[01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:42.170]  If you're in a small space, you can work with a small ceramic halide or maybe a very small 250W high-pressure sodium.
[01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:44.170]  But I wouldn't go much more than that.
[01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:49.170]  When you start working into the smaller tents or a small room, that's when you can start introducing the bigger lights.
[01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:52.170]  The small HIDs, the 250W or a 400W.
[01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:57.170]  If you get yourself a 5x5 tent, that's when you can step up to a 600W or a 1000W light.
[01:07:57.170 --> 01:08:03.170]  When you start working on a production grow, you're busting out a whole room, a dedicated space, or maybe a larger tent.
[01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:07.430]  That's when you can work your way into multiple 600W or multiple 1000W lights.
[01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:12.430]  And of course, if you're going to run a warehouse, I highly recommend double-ended bulb technology.
[01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:15.430]  Again, I recommend the Govitas and they do not pay me.
[01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:19.430]  Now, keep in mind that your lights are going to heat the room very quickly.
[01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:25.430]  You're going to need appropriate air conditioning and you're going to need appropriate air flow.
[01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:31.430]  So, let's talk about air conditioning and then we will work our way into air flow and odor control.
[01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:33.690]  Air conditioning, cooling.
[01:08:33.690 --> 01:08:38.690]  In a small grow environment, you can probably get away with a small window air conditioner.
[01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:43.690]  Now, maybe you don't have the option of installing a small window air conditioner.
[01:08:43.690 --> 01:08:46.690]  You can also use those portable air conditioners.
[01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:48.690]  They're on wheels and they have ducting.
[01:08:48.690 --> 01:08:52.690]  They have a duct that brings the air in and a duct that shoots the old hot air out.
[01:08:52.690 --> 01:08:56.690]  I like to use those, but I do not use the in-duct.
[01:08:56.690 --> 01:08:58.690]  I only use the duct that shoots the heat out.
[01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:05.950]  I keep the air from my grow room being recycled in the grow, so I'm not bringing out that air from outside and introducing it into the grow room.
[01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:13.950]  There's no filtration in that air conditioner before that air gets into my grow, so I don't want to suck in some weird stuff and bring it into the grow.
[01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:18.950]  So, I don't use that duct. I only use the out-duct on a portable air conditioner.
[01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:21.950]  Now, those portable air conditioners are very inefficient.
[01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:26.950]  They cost a lot of money to buy and they cost a lot of money to run, but they are very discreet.
[01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:30.210]  They are very portable and they work very well.
[01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:32.210]  They'll cool the room down very quickly.
[01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:34.210]  You can kind of roll it right to where you need it.
[01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:36.210]  Those are always an option.
[01:09:36.210 --> 01:09:42.210]  Something to think about with air conditioning is you've got air going out of your grow room now that is not filtered.
[01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:47.210]  If your room with your grow is right up against your neighbor's house also,
[01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:54.210]  putting that air conditioner in that window may not be an option because you might start blasting that sweet ganja smell right into your neighbor's bedroom.
[01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:58.470]  They're going to be trying to sleep and they're just going to be dreaming about smoking a joint at a fish concert.
[01:09:58.470 --> 01:10:02.470]  So, be careful where you duct your air conditioning air.
[01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:13.470]  Now, another really important thing to think about is how much air conditioning do we need in a small grow, in a residential grow, not a warehouse type of environment.
[01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:23.470]  If you're using 1,000 watt high-pressure sodium lights, I recommend about 3,000 BTUs of cooling per 1,000 watt light.
[01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:25.730]  I'll say that again for you.
[01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:31.730]  I recommend 3,000 BTUs of cooling for every 1,000 watt light.
[01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:35.730]  So, if you've got two lights, you want 6,000 watts of air conditioning.
[01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:38.730]  If you've got four lights, you want 12,000 watts of air conditioning.
[01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:42.730]  I also recommend go a little extra because it's been hot lately.
[01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:48.730]  Every summer it gets hotter and hotter and I don't want you to struggle in your grow with heat.
[01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:53.990]  A lot of the companies that make the portable air conditioners make a 14,000 BTU unit.
[01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:59.990]  That is just about perfect for a 4,000 watt light setup, which is beautiful for a spare bedroom.
[01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:01.990]  So, that's something to think about.
[01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:07.990]  Now, if you're in a tiny grow like a closet or maybe a space that you've built, I understand that you can't install an air conditioner.
[01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:16.990]  The way you're going to have to cool that is by putting a blower somewhere in there and exhausting the heat out of that enclosure into the main room.
[01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:22.250]  Then, pulling air in through maybe a passive duct from the room that's already got nice fresh air.
[01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:24.250]  If you're in the room, it's probably comfortable for the plant.
[01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:31.250]  So, if you're ducting out that hot air and just pulling in fresh air through a passive vent in a small enclosure, that will work perfectly.
[01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:36.250]  Just make sure you've got enough power to suck the air out of that enclosure often enough.
[01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:45.250]  Also, make sure you put a carbon filter on there so that you don't snitch on yourself and blow that fresh ganja scented air right into the living room where everybody's hanging out.
[01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.510]  You think you've got this little enclosure, it's all smooth.
[01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:52.510]  You've got a fish tank set up next to it so that all the noise is covered and all the plugins are covered.
[01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:54.510]  You've got an excuse for everything.
[01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:58.510]  But, every time they walk past it, they just get blown with wind that smells like ganja.
[01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:00.510]  Pay attention to that sort of stuff, you guys.
[01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:04.510]  So, in a small enclosure, you're going to have to use a blower to close it or to cool it.
[01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:07.510]  You're going to have to use passive air from the room to cool that.
[01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:12.510]  Like I said, if you're in the room, if that's where you live, if that's where you're hanging out, it's probably comfortable for the plants.
[01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:16.770]  It's not going to be perfect, but in a small enclosure, that may be the best you can do.
[01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:23.770]  Now, let's talk about cooling a giant facility, a warehouse, or maybe a small barn.
[01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:27.770]  When it comes to cooling, Govita lighting, it is a totally different ballgame.
[01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:30.770]  This is when we move into industrial cooling.
[01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:32.770]  This is when we move into rooftop units.
[01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:35.770]  We can't use little wall units and portable units anymore.
[01:12:35.770 --> 01:12:40.770]  We have to get big boy air conditioning and HVAC setups.
[01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:45.030]  So, if you're setting up an industrial grow and you're going to hang Govitas,
[01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:57.030]  I will recommend between 4,000 and 6,000 BTU per Govita or 1 ton of cooling for every 2 Govita fixtures in the room.
[01:12:57.030 --> 01:13:04.030]  Another thing I will recommend is instead of 1 large rooftop unit, so let's say you need 30 tons of cooling in your room,
[01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:11.290]  I would recommend that you break that 30 tons up amongst multiple units so that if you have a failure in one unit,
[01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:16.290]  you can still run at three quarters or half of your capacity and not have to shut down the room.
[01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:23.290]  If you can keep it just cool enough to survive with three, but you've got four most of the time, one breaks, you've still got three running strong,
[01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:26.290]  if they can push it and keep the room cool, you're still in business.
[01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:30.290]  If you've got one 30 ton unit and it dies, you're fucked.
[01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:33.290]  The lights are going to turn off because it's 100 degrees in there in no time.
[01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:41.550]  That is my suggestion to you. Divide your HVAC into multiple units so that when one of your units fails, you've got a major backup plan.
[01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:49.550]  Trust me, your HVAC units will fail. That is my number one complaint in a commercial facility, the HVAC.
[01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:55.550]  It always takes a shit. There's always an HVAC issue somewhere that I've got to deal with. That is never a surprise.
[01:13:55.550 --> 01:14:00.550]  I know a lot of HVAC guys on a first name basis. I've got their name and number right on my phone.
[01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:04.810]  A lot of them are on speed dial. Siri is familiar with the HVAC crew.
[01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:07.810]  Really don't be a cheap ass when it comes to HVAC.
[01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:16.810]  If you're building a home grow, if you're building a commercial grow, I really recommend you get a good air conditioner and keep that room nice and cool.
[01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:22.810]  Your plants will be really happy if you get them in the low 70s or the high 70s, low 80s.
[01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:25.810]  They will really show you a difference from when you had them in the mid 80s.
[01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:31.070]  You'll see a huge difference in your production, the quality, the terpenes, the weight.
[01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:34.070]  Everything will be better when you cool them down a little bit.
[01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:38.070]  So in a really small space, you're just going to have to use air exchange for cooling.
[01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:43.070]  That's not going to work in a larger space. You'll have to figure out air conditioning.
[01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:49.070]  If it's a window unit, if you're cutting a hole in the wall and creating a window for a window unit, that's always an option.
[01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:53.070]  But keep in mind, it's going to blow heat out the other side, so you're heating up the other side of that wall.
[01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:57.330]  Maybe you've got yourself one of those portable air conditioners. I really like those.
[01:14:57.330 --> 01:15:03.330]  That thing has a duct that goes outside. Do the same thing to that duct that I recommend you did to your light duct.
[01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:09.330]  Put a little pantyhose over it to work as a condom so that you don't get a mouse climbing up into that or a lizard climbing up into that.
[01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:13.330]  When it's kind of cool outside and they feel that warm air coming out, they're like, that feels cozy.
[01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:16.330]  They just climb right up in there. Put something over it to prevent that.
[01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:22.330]  Then once we move into a larger grow, you may need more window units or more portable ACs.
[01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:26.590]  If those don't cut it, there's always the mini split option. I kind of skipped over the mini split.
[01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:31.590]  A mini split is a big unit that sits outside and then it runs conduit through the wall.
[01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:37.590]  The mini split hangs on the wall. You've seen them. It's about three feet long and it just looks like a vent on the wall.
[01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:40.590]  It is an air conditioner vent. That's part of a mini split.
[01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:44.590]  I think those run about 30,000 BTUs of cooling.
[01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:48.590]  If you've got about eight to ten lights, a mini split may be ideal.
[01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:51.590]  I'm sure they do make them in stronger models.
[01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:55.850]  Then we move up into an industrial grow and that's where we start recommending rooftop units.
[01:15:55.850 --> 01:16:05.850]  Again, I'm going to recommend four to six thousand BTUs of cooling per Govita or one half ton of cooling per Govita fixture.
[01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:09.850]  For every two Govitas you hang, you do need one ton of cooling.
[01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:12.850]  Now we know how to light the room and get it real hot.
[01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:14.850]  Now we've talked about a few ways to cool the room.
[01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:19.850]  Let's talk a little bit about airflow and odor control.
[01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:29.110]  If you decide to run ducted lights or if you decide to run an exhaust vent in your room to expel humidity or stale air every so often,
[01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:34.110]  I would highly recommend you add a carbon filter to that extraction fan.
[01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:37.110]  You don't need to send unfiltered air out of your grow.
[01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:45.110]  Most of the cannabis busts happening in my city are based on a neighbor complaining of odor.
[01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:48.110]  A neighbor says, hey, that smell is too strong.
[01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:49.370]  They decide which house it's coming from.
[01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:50.370]  They call the cops.
[01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:51.370]  The cops come.
[01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:52.370]  They knock on your door.
[01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:53.370]  They show up and knock.
[01:16:53.370 --> 01:16:57.370]  They say, hey, the neighbors say it smells too strongly of cannabis here.
[01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:58.370]  Do you have a grow?
[01:16:58.370 --> 01:16:59.370]  You either say yes or no.
[01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:01.370]  That's when they make their next move.
[01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:03.370]  If you say yes, they say, can we look?
[01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:04.370]  Then they come in and take a look.
[01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:09.370]  If you've got the right amount of plants, if you're not over your count, they high five you and they say, sorry to bug you.
[01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:11.370]  And they leave and they tell your neighbor, shut the fuck up.
[01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:13.370]  He's got enough plants and he's okay.
[01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:15.370]  If you've got too many plants, shit goes wrong.
[01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:17.370]  That's when you probably say, no, you can't come in.
[01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:19.630]  That's when they go, yeah, because you've got too many plants, asshole.
[01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:21.630]  And then that's when things escalate.
[01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:24.630]  So my point is odor control.
[01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:29.630]  Don't get yourself in trouble by growing stinky weed and advertising it to the neighborhood.
[01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:31.630]  Get a carbon filter.
[01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:36.630]  Get the appropriate size carbon filter and blower for your grow space.
[01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:37.630]  What's your goal?
[01:17:37.630 --> 01:17:40.630]  Are you blowing it over the lights to try to cool the lights?
[01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:48.890]  Are you also using that carbon filter blower and ducting system to pull air in through passive vents in that room while cooling those lights?
[01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:49.890]  Because yes, that will work for you.
[01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:53.890]  But at the same time, you're sucking your air conditioning cooling out of the room at the same time.
[01:17:53.890 --> 01:17:58.890]  But also my theory is that that air conditioning cooling is also helping cool the bulbs as it passes over there.
[01:17:58.890 --> 01:17:59.890]  I don't know if that's real or not.
[01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:01.890]  That's kind of the way I have one grow set up.
[01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:04.890]  Anyway, do you need to move a whole bunch of air over lights?
[01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:06.890]  Do you need to move it a long distance?
[01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:12.150]  Or do you just need to run that air through a carbon filter and out of the room to get rid of excess humidity?
[01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:16.150]  And if you're going to do that, hang your carbon filter up as high as you can in the middle of the room.
[01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:17.150]  That's where the humidity is hidden.
[01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:20.150]  That's where I always recommend the carbon filter up high.
[01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:26.150]  But think about your use of that carbon filter and that blower and get the appropriate setup.
[01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:33.150]  If you've got a huge blower and a small filter, you're going to suck a whole bunch of air through a filter and it's not going to get filtered appropriately.
[01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:36.150]  And you're going to blast that stink right to the neighborhood.
[01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:37.410]  Don't do that.
[01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:43.410]  So get the appropriate blower and carbon filter for anything that is going to exit your grow.
[01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:48.410]  I can recommend the fat filter and the fresh filter because I have used both of them.
[01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:50.410]  They are very similar.
[01:18:50.410 --> 01:18:51.410]  They both work very well for me.
[01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:54.410]  They both last about 18 to 24 months.
[01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:57.410]  I really didn't see a difference in either brand.
[01:18:57.410 --> 01:19:01.410]  So I only recommend them because I was satisfied with both of them.
[01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:05.410]  They were both affordable and they both did what I needed them to do.
[01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:07.670]  So that's odor control.
[01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:08.670]  Let's talk about intake.
[01:19:08.670 --> 01:19:11.670]  We're forcing a bunch of air out of this grow room.
[01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:14.670]  The air conditioner is going to send air out of the grow.
[01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:18.670]  We've probably got an extractor fan blowing humidity out of the grow.
[01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:21.670]  So now we need to replace some of that air.
[01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:23.670]  Are you going to do that through a passive vent?
[01:19:23.670 --> 01:19:27.670]  Are you going to use a powered fan to do that?
[01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:39.930]  Most of your small enclosures, your closets, and probably your small spare bedrooms are going to have enough passive vents to allow enough air to get into that room to replace that air we're pulling out.
[01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:41.930]  It'll probably come in through under the door.
[01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:43.930]  That's a lot more space than you realize.
[01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:48.930]  If you calculated that half inch gap by three feet, that's a lot of space.
[01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:50.930]  So a lot of air can flow through there.
[01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:53.930]  So we're replacing a lot of that air through there.
[01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:56.930]  If you want to replace the air much more quickly, you can make a hole.
[01:19:57.190 --> 01:20:02.190]  If you feel like you're getting a whistle from under that door and it's trying to pull the door off when the air conditioner comes on,
[01:20:02.190 --> 01:20:06.190]  if you've got pressure in there or if it's trying to blow the door off one or the other,
[01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:09.190]  you may need to relieve some pressure one way or another.
[01:20:09.190 --> 01:20:11.190]  So a passive vent may be the way to go.
[01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:16.190]  Just start with a three inch hole or maybe a four inch hole somewhere low on the wall.
[01:20:16.190 --> 01:20:23.190]  I like to make my intake vents low and my outtake vents high because the cooler air is lower.
[01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:28.450]  So just make a couple of holes and of course you're going to have to make that lightproof also.
[01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:34.450]  So think of a way to make it lightproof and also maybe consider stapling one of those HEPA filters over it
[01:20:34.450 --> 01:20:38.450]  to prevent any bugs or anything from traveling from room to room.
[01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:40.450]  So a passive vent is really easy to do.
[01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:42.450]  I just put a dryer vent over it once I've made it.
[01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:45.450]  I think it's a four inch hole fits perfectly for a dryer vent.
[01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:48.450]  So you can just put a little dryer vent over it and that way no light will shine through there.
[01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:52.450]  And it's also real low to the ground so you don't have as much light risk coming in.
[01:20:52.710 --> 01:20:54.710]  So just put it low to the ground, put the dryer vent over it and you'll be cool.
[01:20:54.710 --> 01:20:57.710]  That's a four inch passive vent into the room.
[01:20:57.710 --> 01:21:00.710]  So now when the air conditioner is blowing out all that stale air
[01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:03.710]  and while your exhaust fan is sucking out humidity up top,
[01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:07.710]  you've got some passive fresh air coming in through that hole in the wall.
[01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:09.710]  It doesn't take any electricity or equipment.
[01:21:09.710 --> 01:21:13.710]  Now if you really want to blast more air in there, get one of those squirrel cage fans,
[01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:15.710]  cut a hole in the wall, mount that squirrel cage fan in there.
[01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:19.710]  You can run ducting or however you want to do that and just blast more air in the room.
[01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:22.970]  If that's something you want to do, it's probably not necessary.
[01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:25.970]  Now let's talk a little bit about air flow.
[01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:28.970]  We do need to move the air around.
[01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:32.970]  We want air exchange and air flow in the room at all times.
[01:21:32.970 --> 01:21:35.970]  We don't need a giant tornado in there beating our plants up,
[01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:38.970]  but we do need air movement constantly.
[01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:41.970]  In a small grow, I like to put one fan per light.
[01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:45.970]  So if you've got a small bedroom with four lights, why not hang up four fans?
[01:21:45.970 --> 01:21:47.970]  That way you get plenty of air flow.
[01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:50.230]  You don't get any hot spots in there.
[01:21:50.230 --> 01:21:52.230]  In a larger grow, I understand that is not reasonable.
[01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:56.230]  It would not make any sense to hang a hundred fans in one room.
[01:21:56.230 --> 01:22:01.230]  I try to place a fan about every six to eight feet on the wall.
[01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:05.230]  And depending on the height of my tables or my benches or my canopy,
[01:22:05.230 --> 01:22:07.230]  that decides where I place my fans.
[01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:09.230]  They're definitely lower than the lights.
[01:22:09.230 --> 01:22:14.230]  They'll be just between, hopefully they'll be between the lights and where the top of my canopy ends.
[01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:19.490]  So if I'm using gavitas, I've got a three foot space between the light and the top of the plants.
[01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:22.490]  Somewhere in that three foot space, that's probably where I would have my fans.
[01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:24.490]  Probably right at the bottom of that three foot space.
[01:22:24.490 --> 01:22:27.490]  You've got gavitas, three feet, and then a fan.
[01:22:27.490 --> 01:22:30.490]  In another environment, you're probably going to have a light,
[01:22:30.490 --> 01:22:33.490]  and then maybe like a foot, maybe two, and then your fans,
[01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:35.490]  and then the top of your plants right there.
[01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:37.490]  So that's where you want to hang your fans.
[01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:41.490]  In a small environment, like I said, about one fan per light.
[01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:43.490]  In a larger environment, I know that's not reasonable.
[01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:47.750]  You're going to want to go about one fan every six feet on the wall.
[01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:51.750]  And then if you can attach fans somewhere in the middle of the room to some poles or something,
[01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:53.750]  that will always help.
[01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:54.750]  We just want air flow.
[01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:56.750]  We don't need to beat the plants to death.
[01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:57.750]  We don't need a hurricane in there.
[01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:59.750]  We just want to move that air around.
[01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:01.750]  We want to rustle the leaves nice and gently.
[01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:04.750]  Recently, I discovered some fans that mount to the ceiling,
[01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:07.750]  and they actually pull air from the ground up,
[01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:10.750]  and they've got a louver that spreads the air outward.
[01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:15.010]  So the air comes from the ground up, and then it spreads it across the ceiling,
[01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:17.010]  and then that falls back down.
[01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:22.010]  I think those are great fans for any facility that is using CO2 augmentation.
[01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:27.010]  It'll bring that unused CO2 up off the floor and redistribute it back amongst the canopy.
[01:23:27.010 --> 01:23:31.010]  And it also creates a lot of air flow in the grow without excessive wind.
[01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:35.010]  So look into those fans if you need more air flow in your garden.
[01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:39.010]  And of course, if you're in a home grow, you can get those fans that are on a stand at Walmart.
[01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:42.270]  Just basic stand fans. Those work great.
[01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:44.270]  Buy them right at the start of winter when they go on sale.
[01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:46.270]  Go to Lowe's and clean them out because they'll be on sale.
[01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:48.270]  Don't try to buy your fans at the start of summer.
[01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:50.270]  Get them in the winter, and they are on sale.
[01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:52.270]  In summer, they are sold out.
[01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:54.270]  That's a grower trick.
[01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:56.270]  I also like to put fans low in the room.
[01:23:56.270 --> 01:24:00.270]  It wouldn't be odd to see a fan on the floor in my grow room.
[01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:04.270]  I buy those square box fans and just set one on the floor in the corner,
[01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:06.270]  blowing right toward the other corner.
[01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:08.270]  That's just going to help a little bit more air flow,
[01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:10.530]  but air flow is always your friend.
[01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:12.530]  Also, it will help if you spill some water.
[01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:16.530]  If you need the floor to dry, a fan is always your friend to help you dry up a spill.
[01:24:16.530 --> 01:24:18.530]  Alright, now we've covered lighting.
[01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:21.530]  We have covered HVAC and cooling and air flow.
[01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:24.530]  Let's get into the next couple of details we should think about.
[01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:27.530]  Humidification and dehumidification.
[01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:31.530]  Depending on your location, these may be crucial elements for your grow.
[01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:35.530]  In Colorado, we use both. I've talked about this a lot.
[01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:37.530]  We have days where it will be 95.
[01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:39.790]  It will be hot and dry.
[01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:43.790]  Then in the night, it will drop to the high 50s and it will rain.
[01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:49.790]  We use every piece of equipment in our HVAC arsenal in one day in a commercial grow in Colorado.
[01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:51.790]  We will use the heater in the morning.
[01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:53.790]  We will use the air conditioner all day.
[01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:55.790]  We will use the dehumidifier all night.
[01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:58.790]  We will use the humidifier all day.
[01:24:58.790 --> 01:25:00.790]  Think about those items.
[01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:04.790]  If you've got a small space, maybe you can get by with just a small humidifier
[01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:09.050]  like you would use for when you're sick or to humidify the baby's bedroom.
[01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:12.050]  Just get a small one from Walmart.
[01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:16.050]  Maybe that will work for a small tent or a small bedroom grow.
[01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:25.050]  When you're moving into a bigger environment, you do need a larger industrial size, industrial use humidifier or dehumidifier.
[01:25:25.050 --> 01:25:31.050]  I always say I don't like to recommend brands, but when you're entering into the commercial dehumidification game,
[01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:35.310]  I am of course going to recommend a Quest dehumidifier.
[01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:37.310]  The units on wheels are great.
[01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:40.310]  They are very expensive and very inefficient.
[01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:44.310]  The units that hang from the ceiling are what I would recommend.
[01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:48.310]  I like to set my dehumidifier up on something like a Smartbee or a PL Grow unit
[01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:52.310]  and have something like that trigger it so that you can dial in that room perfectly.
[01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:54.310]  Set the dehumidifier knob.
[01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:55.310]  It's got a knob on it.
[01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:56.310]  Turn that almost all the way up.
[01:25:56.570 --> 01:26:01.570]  Plug that into a trigger that is triggered by another monitoring device.
[01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:05.570]  When you hit the appropriate humidity level, that thing will trigger on for you.
[01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:09.570]  I love setting up a dehumidifier on some sort of a triggering device.
[01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:11.570]  It keeps the rooms dialed in so well.
[01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:14.570]  You need somewhere to run that water off.
[01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:19.570]  A lot of people say you can use that water that's collected from a dehumidifier.
[01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:24.570]  I stopped doing it because after a while, the coils in that dehumidifier gather funk
[01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:26.830]  and that funk ends up in your water.
[01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:32.830]  Also, funky shit ends up in the tube that drains from the dehumidifier into whatever you're catching it in.
[01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:34.830]  I've seen weird shit come out of that dehumidifier water.
[01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:35.830]  I don't know what it was.
[01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:36.830]  We stopped using it.
[01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:38.830]  I found it to be unsafe.
[01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:44.830]  Like I said about your HVAC units, I would recommend buying multiple small dehumidifiers
[01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:45.830]  if your budget works for that.
[01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:50.830]  Instead of one large dehumidifier for when that dehumidifier breaks,
[01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:52.830]  then you have a backup plan.
[01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:57.090]  You can still at least control the humidity a little bit with unit number two.
[01:26:57.090 --> 01:27:01.090]  Also, make sure you keep the filters on your dehumidifiers clean.
[01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:06.090]  In a small unit or a large unit, it will make a huge difference.
[01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:11.090]  My recommendation for humidification and dehumidification is to find a unit
[01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:17.090]  that is appropriate for the size space you are trying to humidify or dehumidify.
[01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:19.090]  Find something that fits your budget.
[01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:22.350]  Don't worry too much about the controls on the unit.
[01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:26.350]  As long as it's got an off and on, we can plug it into something that will trigger it
[01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:30.350]  and that will help us dial in our humidity levels right where we want them.
[01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:34.350]  If you want more guidance on humidity levels and vapor pressure deficit,
[01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:39.350]  I would recommend listening to the vapor pressure deficit episode that I did a while back.
[01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:45.350]  That is episode 314, Vapor Pressure Deficit, Bug Poops, and Testing Samples.
[01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:46.350]  Go check that one out.
[01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:47.350]  All right, you guys.
[01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:48.350]  I've been going for about 40 minutes.
[01:27:48.610 --> 01:27:53.610]  I feel like I have given you a lot of information to absorb when it comes to selecting equipment
[01:27:53.610 --> 01:27:54.610]  for your new grow.
[01:27:54.610 --> 01:27:58.610]  There are still a few details I would like to cover, but I think I'm going to save that
[01:27:58.610 --> 01:28:00.610]  for the next episode.
[01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:03.610]  In the next episode, we'll talk more about controllers.
[01:28:03.610 --> 01:28:04.610]  What are you going to plug everything into?
[01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:07.610]  What are we going to use to monitor the environment in your room?
[01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:12.610]  What are we going to use to trigger your humidifier, your fans, your dehumidifiers,
[01:28:12.610 --> 01:28:13.610]  your extraction fans?
[01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:15.610]  What are we going to use for that sort of stuff?
[01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:19.870]  We'll also talk about pots, soil, and then we'll talk about nutrients.
[01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:24.870]  Then we will talk a little bit about integrated pest management and how all of these things
[01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:25.870]  need to work together.
[01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:27.870]  I'm going to start wrapping up this episode.

[01:29:53.650 --> 01:29:57.650]  It's time for episode 355 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:29:57.650 --> 01:29:58.650]  Thank you for joining me.
[01:29:58.650 --> 01:30:03.650]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:08.650]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:12.910]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:19.910]  You guys, somebody has been smoking all of my concentrates, but I'm pretty sure it was me.
[01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:22.910]  I've been going pretty quickly through this blueberry citron fambrosia.
[01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:24.910]  This stuff is delicious.
[01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:30.910]  I've described it as oranges coated in sugar with a hint of the purple Laffy Taffy, maybe
[01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:31.910]  a hint of blueberry in there.
[01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:35.910]  It is blueberry and clementine, so that would make total sense.
[01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:37.910]  It gives me a really nice head buzz.
[01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:42.170]  It keeps me nice and energized, and it certainly makes me nice and talkative, so it's great.
[01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:43.170]  Podcast dabs.
[01:30:43.170 --> 01:30:48.170]  The only bad part is it tastes really good, so I always want to dab more of it, so it's almost gone.
[01:30:48.170 --> 01:30:53.170]  The good part about that is I'll open a fresh concentrate on the next episode, and we will
[01:30:53.170 --> 01:30:55.170]  get to talk about a brand new flavor.
[01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:56.170]  All right.
[01:30:56.170 --> 01:31:00.170]  In this episode, we're going to get back on track with the grow lessons.
[01:31:00.170 --> 01:31:05.170]  This will be the fourth episode in a long series of grow lessons that will take us from
[01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:07.430]  the beginning of a grow all the way to the end.
[01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:09.430]  We've already done planning your grow.
[01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:11.430]  We've worked on selecting your grow space.
[01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:13.430]  We also talked a lot about planning your equipment.
[01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:18.430]  We talked a lot about planning your lighting, your air conditioning, and how to handle airflow.
[01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:22.430]  Now, in this episode, we're going to talk a little bit about how to control all of that
[01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:25.430]  stuff and what to plug all of those things into.
[01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:29.430]  So let's jump right into selecting your equipment part two.
[01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:34.430]  The first thing we'll probably need to think about is what are we going to plug the light into.
[01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:36.690]  Sure, you can plug it directly into the wall.
[01:31:36.690 --> 01:31:39.690]  Now, it's going to be on 24 hours a day.
[01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:44.690]  Don't rely on yourself or your high roommate or maybe your girlfriend.
[01:31:44.690 --> 01:31:50.690]  Don't rely on anybody but technology to turn that light off and on at the same time every day.
[01:31:50.690 --> 01:31:52.690]  We need consistent light control.
[01:31:52.690 --> 01:31:56.690]  So let's talk about a controller for that light.
[01:31:56.690 --> 01:32:01.690]  The easiest route to go is just a basic on-off timer that you can program to be on from a
[01:32:01.690 --> 01:32:03.690]  certain time and off at another time.
[01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:05.950]  I recommend digital timers.
[01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:08.950]  I like a timer with a battery backup.
[01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:09.950]  Think about this.
[01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:10.950]  You've got an analog timer.
[01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:15.950]  An analog timer, you plug it in and you spin it to the correct time and then you push pins
[01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:19.950]  down for when you want the light to come on and then you leave pins up for when you want
[01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:20.950]  the light to go off.
[01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:24.950]  Now, you set it to the correct time and while it's plugged in, that dial spins.
[01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:28.950]  And then when the time comes, it clicks the lights to the appropriate on or off and then
[01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:29.950]  it keeps spinning.
[01:32:30.210 --> 01:32:34.210]  If you have a power interruption, that timer stops spinning.
[01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:38.210]  So whatever time the power goes out, that timer thinks it's that time.
[01:32:38.210 --> 01:32:42.210]  If it goes out at 3 o'clock, it's always 3 o'clock until the electricity comes back.
[01:32:42.210 --> 01:32:44.210]  Then it starts back up at 3 o'clock.
[01:32:44.210 --> 01:32:48.210]  The lights will come on and they'll run until they're programmed off cycle.
[01:32:48.210 --> 01:32:54.210]  If you have a digital timer with a battery backup, if you have a power failure, if the
[01:32:54.210 --> 01:32:57.210]  power goes out at 3, your clock and your timer keeps ticking.
[01:32:57.470 --> 01:33:01.470]  So when the lights come back on, your grow room is still on the regular schedule and
[01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:05.470]  your lights, yes, you did get that dark period from the light interruption, but you are now
[01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:07.470]  back on your regular grow cycle.
[01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:09.470]  So you're not going to throw your whole grow system off.
[01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:14.470]  So I recommend if you're going to buy a basic plug-in timer, I recommend a digital
[01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:16.470]  timer with the battery backup.
[01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:21.470]  Also, make sure you get a timer that is rated to support enough amperage or voltage for
[01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:23.470]  your grow light.
[01:33:23.730 --> 01:33:27.730]  So for one light, a small plug-in timer, it goes straight into the wall.
[01:33:27.730 --> 01:33:29.730]  You set the time on that timer.
[01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:33.730]  You set your off and on scheduled times and the light will go off and on when you expect
[01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:34.730]  it to.
[01:33:34.730 --> 01:33:36.730]  For one light, that's a really easy basic setup.
[01:33:36.730 --> 01:33:41.730]  You can plug 1,000 watt into that with no problem in most homes.
[01:33:41.730 --> 01:33:45.730]  Or they do make another timer that has two outlets on it.
[01:33:45.730 --> 01:33:51.730]  With that timer, you can plug in probably two 600s, definitely two 400s, maybe a four
[01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:56.990]  and a six, but I would not recommend attempting to plug in 2,000 watts unless you've done
[01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:58.990]  some electrical upgrades in that home.
[01:33:58.990 --> 01:34:00.990]  That will flip the breaker.
[01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:04.990]  If you try to plug in 2,000 watt lights into one outlet without any upgrades, you're going
[01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.990]  to flip the breaker.
[01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:08.990]  I know I've said that a couple of times in these episodes, but I want you to keep that
[01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:10.990]  in mind when you're thinking about building your grow.
[01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:13.990]  A lot of people say, no, my house will probably be able to do it.
[01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.990]  No, it won't, dude.
[01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.990]  Your house isn't special.
[01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:17.990]  You don't have magic breakers.
[01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:19.990]  You didn't buy magic ballasts.
[01:34:20.250 --> 01:34:23.250]  You're probably going to flip breakers if you put too much electricity through them,
[01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:26.250]  and you also start running a risk of fire.
[01:34:26.250 --> 01:34:27.250]  Everything starts getting weaker.
[01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:31.250]  The more time you flip that breaker, the weaker it's getting, which also means you're heating
[01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:33.250]  up the receptacles, which also means you're heating up the wires.
[01:34:33.250 --> 01:34:35.250]  You're stressing everything.
[01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:37.250]  Over time, that equals fire.
[01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:42.250]  So just quit pressing your luck, reduce your amount of lights, settle for having less lighting,
[01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:45.250]  or pay for the electrical upgrades that are required.
[01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:46.250]  Here's another idea that people get.
[01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:49.510]  They plug in the timer, then they plug in the power strip, and then they plug in their
[01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:52.510]  light and other accessories into that power strip.
[01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:56.510]  Make sure if you're going to do that, that that power strip is strong enough and rated
[01:34:56.510 --> 01:35:01.510]  to support the voltage and amperage for all of the electronics you're plugging into there.
[01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:04.510]  Also, you can't plug in another light just by doing that.
[01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:05.510]  You're going to blow up that timer.
[01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:08.510]  It's going to short out, or you're going to short out the receptacles.
[01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:10.510]  I've already talked about the things that are going to happen.
[01:35:10.770 --> 01:35:15.770]  You can plug in an extension cord or a power strip into your timer and provide multiple
[01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:20.770]  plug-in spots so that they all come on at the same time, but do not overload that power
[01:35:20.770 --> 01:35:21.770]  strip.
[01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:24.770]  Maybe have the light and a fan come on at the same time with the power strip.
[01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:25.770]  That's not a bad idea.
[01:35:25.770 --> 01:35:27.770]  Maybe a light and two small fans would work for you.
[01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:29.770]  Maybe a light, a blower, and a fan.
[01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:31.770]  But don't think you can outsmart electricity.
[01:35:31.770 --> 01:35:35.770]  Don't think you got smart by plugging in a power strip, and then you were able to overload
[01:35:35.770 --> 01:35:36.770]  that timer.
[01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:39.770]  That timer will just crap out on you, and then it'll be too late.
[01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:42.030]  It'll just crash on you, and then it'll be dark, or it'll catch on fire.
[01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:43.030]  It may just melt.
[01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:45.030]  All right, so let me get back on track.
[01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:49.030]  For one light, a timer plugged directly into the wall, then the light plugged into that.
[01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:51.030]  That is perfect for one light.
[01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:56.030]  You can also possibly run two lights if you're running four 600-watt lights with a dual timer.
[01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:57.030]  They do make that.
[01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:59.030]  It is available at your growth store.
[01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:01.030]  It may be available at your local hardware store.
[01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:02.030]  I'm not sure what's available to you.
[01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:05.030]  It is certainly available on Amazon.
[01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:08.030]  Of course, we always recommend you shop locally at a mom-and-pop shop.
[01:36:08.290 --> 01:36:10.290]  Avoid those big-box stores.
[01:36:10.290 --> 01:36:12.290]  Recently, I've said things like Lowe's and Walmart.
[01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:18.290]  I say that because I know you guys have those, but if you have a smaller local shop, go there.
[01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:19.290]  That does help out.
[01:36:19.290 --> 01:36:22.290]  All right, now we know how to control one or two lights.
[01:36:22.290 --> 01:36:24.290]  We just use a basic horticultural timer.
[01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:25.290]  Plug it into the wall.
[01:36:25.290 --> 01:36:26.290]  Plug your light into there.
[01:36:26.290 --> 01:36:27.290]  That's real easy.
[01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:31.290]  Now, what if we want to run three, maybe four, maybe six or eight lights?
[01:36:31.290 --> 01:36:32.290]  What do we do then?
[01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:34.290]  The first step to that is electrical upgrades.
[01:36:34.290 --> 01:36:37.290]  I'm going to talk about that a lot when we talk about these lessons, because I don't
[01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:39.550]  want you to put yourself or your house in danger.
[01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:40.550]  Electrical upgrades.
[01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:44.550]  If you're going to do four lights in a room, you will need electrical upgrades.
[01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:50.550]  Now, when you're doing the electrical upgrades, it's the time to start thinking about your lighting controllers.
[01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:54.550]  Some of them have a plug that looks like the plug that plugs into the dryer.
[01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:58.550]  Some of them are sold with just bare wires at the end that you have to hardwire in.
[01:36:58.550 --> 01:37:02.550]  Keep that in mind when you're designing your space and selecting your controller.
[01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:05.550]  Do you want to hardwire your controller in?
[01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:07.810]  Is this going to be a permanent fixture?
[01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:11.810]  Or do you want something you can plug into a dryer type plug-in, and then maybe you can
[01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:14.810]  upgrade or downgrade or replace that unit in the future?
[01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:16.810]  Think about this now while you're planning your growth.
[01:37:16.810 --> 01:37:19.810]  So, let's talk about lighting controllers while we're here.
[01:37:19.810 --> 01:37:21.810]  What do I mean by a lighting controller?
[01:37:21.810 --> 01:37:26.810]  A lighting controller is basically a large timer that, like I said, it either plugs into
[01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:28.810]  the dryer plug or it's hardwired right in.
[01:37:28.810 --> 01:37:34.810]  And it's got multiple plug-ins on it to where you can plug in four, six, eight.
[01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:37.070]  I've seen 12 lights on one of these devices.
[01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:40.070]  I've seen 24 lights on a flip box on lighting controllers.
[01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:44.070]  A Govita Master Controller will run 48 lights at one time, I believe.
[01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:48.070]  Let's focus more on something you may find in a home grow now.
[01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:54.070]  For a lighting controller in a small home grow, you may find a box with a timer in it,
[01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:59.070]  with a bunch of plug-ins in it, with a cord that comes out, like I said, that plugs into
[01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:01.070]  the 240 or it's hardwired in.
[01:38:01.330 --> 01:38:05.330]  And that one timer will function all of the plug-ins on that box.
[01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:10.330]  There may also be a switch that will allow a couple of those plug-ins to operate independently
[01:38:10.330 --> 01:38:14.330]  so they can stay on all the time or you can flip a switch and they work with the timer.
[01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:16.330]  Some of the boxes have that, some of them don't.
[01:38:16.330 --> 01:38:19.330]  The power box is what I'm speaking of specifically.
[01:38:19.330 --> 01:38:24.330]  So, basically, instead of plugging a bunch of timers in and trying to sync them up and
[01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:28.330]  plugging all your lights into four individual timers, you put up a light controller, you
[01:38:28.590 --> 01:38:32.590]  set a timer on that, you set the light schedule you want on that, you either hardwire that
[01:38:32.590 --> 01:38:34.590]  in or you plug it into the dryer fixture.
[01:38:34.590 --> 01:38:39.590]  Then you plug your grow lights into that controller and then when the schedule lighting cycle
[01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:41.590]  comes on, all four lights come on at once.
[01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:43.590]  When it goes off, all four lights go off at once.
[01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:45.590]  You don't have to deal with a bunch of timers.
[01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:47.590]  You don't have to try to sync up four different timers.
[01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:51.590]  You don't have to try to fit four timers in one spot and plug lights into them.
[01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:54.590]  It's all easy to program with one unit with one timer.
[01:38:54.850 --> 01:38:58.850]  There are a lot of different brands of lighting controllers available.
[01:38:58.850 --> 01:39:03.850]  Earlier, I recommended a digital timer with a battery backup.
[01:39:03.850 --> 01:39:07.850]  I would also recommend something similar with your controller.
[01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:11.850]  They do offer a light controller that has a timer with a battery in it.
[01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:15.850]  So, if the power does go out, that timer stays on the same cycle.
[01:39:15.850 --> 01:39:17.850]  That is always advantageous.
[01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:22.850]  So, whether it's digital or it's analog on your lighting controller, try to look for
[01:39:23.110 --> 01:39:24.110]  one with a battery backup.
[01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:28.110]  So, if you do have a power failure, it doesn't throw everything off schedule.
[01:39:28.110 --> 01:39:33.110]  For a home grow or maybe a small garage grow or something like a shed grow, I would probably
[01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:37.110]  recommend a power box or a Titan lighting controller.
[01:39:37.110 --> 01:39:39.110]  I know I don't recommend a lot of brands.
[01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:43.110]  I try to stay away from brands, but those are going to be the two that are most affordable
[01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:47.110]  for somebody trying to get into a medium-sized grow.
[01:39:47.110 --> 01:39:50.110]  I often talk about a four light room that I work in.
[01:39:50.370 --> 01:39:55.370]  In that room, it is controlled by a Powerbox DPC-7500.
[01:39:55.370 --> 01:40:00.370]  It's got the dryer plug that plugs into a dedicated dryer-type plug in that room.
[01:40:00.370 --> 01:40:05.370]  Then, the unit has spots for four plug-ins that are synced up with the timer.
[01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:09.370]  Then, there are two plug-ins that you have the option of pressing a switch, and those
[01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:14.370]  plug-ins either work with the timer or they are on continuous, which means they never turn off.
[01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:19.370]  So, in those four main plug-ins that work with the timer, I plug in four lights.
[01:40:19.630 --> 01:40:23.630]  In those other two plug-ins, I've got a fan and my main extraction blower running.
[01:40:23.630 --> 01:40:26.630]  So, it's all operating off of that one unit.
[01:40:26.630 --> 01:40:31.630]  There are a lot of options when it comes to lighting controllers, so start thinking about
[01:40:31.630 --> 01:40:34.630]  that as we design our grow room.
[01:40:34.630 --> 01:40:37.630]  We've got to plug our lights into something, and we've also got to keep our lights on a
[01:40:37.630 --> 01:40:42.630]  schedule, so a lighting controller will be a huge decision in designing your grow.
[01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:45.630]  Now, let's talk a little bit about your air conditioner.
[01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:48.630]  How are you going to control your air conditioner?
[01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:50.890]  Are you going to plug it directly into the wall?
[01:40:50.890 --> 01:40:54.890]  Are you going to plug it into one of those accessory switches on the power box that is
[01:40:54.890 --> 01:40:55.890]  constantly on?
[01:40:55.890 --> 01:41:00.890]  And then, at that point, are you going to use the thermostat on the air conditioner
[01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:05.890]  and rely on that, or are we going to plug the air conditioner into another trigger device
[01:41:05.890 --> 01:41:10.890]  that has a sensor that hangs in the middle of the room and pays attention to the temperature
[01:41:10.890 --> 01:41:11.890]  there?
[01:41:11.890 --> 01:41:13.890]  Those are a few things to think about.
[01:41:14.150 --> 01:41:19.150]  So, when you are buying your air conditioner, if you plan on plugging it into another triggering
[01:41:19.150 --> 01:41:26.150]  device, make sure you buy an analog air conditioner with analog controllers, like a knob that
[01:41:26.150 --> 01:41:28.150]  clicks, like a high, medium, low.
[01:41:28.150 --> 01:41:33.150]  Some of your digital air conditioners won't work if you try to trigger them with another
[01:41:33.150 --> 01:41:34.150]  device.
[01:41:34.150 --> 01:41:35.150]  So, here's how it will work.
[01:41:35.150 --> 01:41:38.150]  You will have a switch that plugs into the wall.
[01:41:38.150 --> 01:41:43.150]  That switch will have a setting that says, I want this device to come on when the temperature
[01:41:43.410 --> 01:41:44.410]  gets this high.
[01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:48.410]  I want this device to go off when the temperature gets this low.
[01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:50.410]  So, it's just a little range that you set.
[01:41:50.410 --> 01:41:54.410]  Then, that thing has a cord that hangs in the center of the room with a thermometer.
[01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:58.410]  So, now we're getting the temperature from the center of the room instead of where that
[01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:00.410]  air conditioner is located.
[01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:04.410]  Now, we can actually take a reading from the plant area instead of that one wall where
[01:42:04.410 --> 01:42:06.410]  the air conditioner is sitting.
[01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:08.410]  So, now the air conditioner is plugged into this cap switch.
[01:42:08.410 --> 01:42:10.410]  This switch is reading from the middle of the room.
[01:42:10.670 --> 01:42:14.670]  Now, what's going to happen, it's going to say, oh, it's reached the temperature we want.
[01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:15.670]  Let's turn it off.
[01:42:15.670 --> 01:42:17.670]  It doesn't reach up and hit the off switch on the air conditioner.
[01:42:17.670 --> 01:42:19.670]  It simply cuts off the power.
[01:42:19.670 --> 01:42:20.670]  So, now there's no power.
[01:42:20.670 --> 01:42:23.670]  Everything has reset on your digital device.
[01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:27.670]  When it comes back on, is that digital air conditioner going to come back on in the previous
[01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:31.670]  setting, or is it just going to come back on and blink and wait for human interaction
[01:42:31.670 --> 01:42:32.670]  to tell it what to do?
[01:42:32.670 --> 01:42:35.670]  That's the downfall of digital devices.
[01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:40.930]  If you only plan to trigger your air conditioner with the air conditioner's onboard controls,
[01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:43.930]  you can get a digital air conditioner.
[01:42:43.930 --> 01:42:48.930]  If you plan to run your air conditioner through another triggering device, I recommend an
[01:42:48.930 --> 01:42:50.930]  analog air conditioner.
[01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:56.930]  I will make the same recommendation when it comes to humidifiers and dehumidifiers.
[01:42:56.930 --> 01:43:00.930]  If you want to plug them into the wall and let them work off their own functions, off
[01:43:00.930 --> 01:43:03.930]  their own settings, you can do that.
[01:43:04.190 --> 01:43:07.190]  That will be just fine for a tent or a small room.
[01:43:07.190 --> 01:43:12.190]  If you really want to dial it in, I recommend something that can take a humidity measurement
[01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:17.190]  from the middle of the room, like I talked about earlier with the air conditioner.
[01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:20.190]  You would have a cap switch that plugs into the wall.
[01:43:20.190 --> 01:43:23.190]  This would have a humidistat controller on it.
[01:43:23.190 --> 01:43:27.190]  It would say, when the humidity gets to this point, activate this, power this device.
[01:43:27.190 --> 01:43:29.190]  It doesn't even know what's plugged into there.
[01:43:29.190 --> 01:43:31.190]  It just knows that it needs to power that switch.
[01:43:31.450 --> 01:43:34.450]  When the humidity gets below here, turn that switch off.
[01:43:34.450 --> 01:43:40.450]  That cap switch then has a humidistat on a cord that we can hang in the center of the room.
[01:43:40.450 --> 01:43:44.450]  That way we can get our humidity measurement from a more appropriate place instead of down
[01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:48.450]  on the corner on the floor where the humidifier or dehumidifier is located.
[01:43:48.450 --> 01:43:50.450]  We've got a cap switch.
[01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:51.450]  It's plugged into the wall.
[01:43:51.450 --> 01:43:53.450]  It's got settings on it.
[01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:57.450]  It's got a corded humidity reader on it that hangs in the center of the room.
[01:43:57.710 --> 01:44:01.710]  Then we plug our humidifier or dehumidifier into that cap switch.
[01:44:01.710 --> 01:44:05.710]  It is activated by the readings from the center of the room.
[01:44:05.710 --> 01:44:10.710]  These extra controllers are not necessary, but if you really want to dial in your room
[01:44:10.710 --> 01:44:16.710]  to a precise humidity range and a temperature range and get that vapor pressure deficit
[01:44:16.710 --> 01:44:20.710]  dialed in for your plants, these types of devices are what you're going to need.
[01:44:20.710 --> 01:44:23.710]  They make cap switches to trigger everything.
[01:44:23.710 --> 01:44:25.710]  You can trigger your fans, your blowers.
[01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:32.970]  You can set up cap switches to trigger any type of grow room equipment if your equipment is compatible.
[01:44:32.970 --> 01:44:38.970]  You need the type of air conditioner, dehumidifier, and or humidifier that has a knob where you can set to high.
[01:44:38.970 --> 01:44:42.970]  Then you can plug those into other devices that will control them.
[01:44:42.970 --> 01:44:46.970]  That way when they're necessary, they just come on at their highest and they activate.
[01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:49.970]  Then when you reach the parameters you need, they turn off.
[01:44:50.230 --> 01:44:58.230]  For that to work, we need devices that can handle power interruptions that won't reset their settings when they come back on.
[01:44:58.230 --> 01:45:02.230]  Now that's the basic equipment to set up an analog grow room.
[01:45:02.230 --> 01:45:09.230]  Now let's talk about automating things a little more and also giving ourselves the ability to make adjustments
[01:45:09.230 --> 01:45:15.230]  from a remote location and also turn off and on equipment from remote locations.
[01:45:15.490 --> 01:45:22.490]  We'll be able to monitor our grow and make changes on the fly with some of the advanced technology that is available for our grow rooms.
[01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:24.490]  Let's talk a little bit about that stuff.
[01:45:24.490 --> 01:45:30.490]  There are several options for setting up a more automated grow room through technology.
[01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:35.490]  I'm trying to avoid pitching specific brands and specific products here.
[01:45:35.490 --> 01:45:42.490]  But for this example, I'm going to use a specific piece of equipment and a specific brand of equipment
[01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:45.750]  to paint a picture of how we can set up an automated grow room.
[01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:52.750]  I have a lot of experience with this device and with this equipment, so it makes it easy for me to draw the plan in my head,
[01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:55.750]  which makes it easier for me to convey the idea to you.
[01:45:55.750 --> 01:46:00.750]  This is an example of how I set up the automation at a recent facility I worked with.
[01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:07.750]  I'm going to try to stay away from mentioning brand names and proprietary specific names of their devices.
[01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:09.750]  But this is how we do it.
[01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:13.010]  This brand comes with a brain.
[01:46:13.010 --> 01:46:17.010]  That brain syncs up through Wi-Fi to your cell phone.
[01:46:17.010 --> 01:46:22.010]  You set up an account, you create a password, then you design your grow rooms.
[01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:25.010]  If you've got a bedroom, just go make bedroom.
[01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:28.010]  If you've got two bedrooms, make two bedrooms, give them a name.
[01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:31.010]  Then you enter your flower rooms.
[01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:34.010]  Flower A, Flower B, Flower C, however you want to do it.
[01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:36.010]  You just type them in and you create the rooms.
[01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:39.270]  Then you select a room on the application.
[01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:44.270]  If you're doing a small home grow, it's probably just the flower room, the one room that you've got.
[01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:47.270]  Now that's where the next fun piece of equipment comes in.
[01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:50.270]  The next piece of equipment looks like a basic power strip.
[01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:55.270]  It's got a plug that plugs into the wall and then it has four available plug-in spots.
[01:46:55.270 --> 01:47:02.270]  It plugs into the wall and now it connects wirelessly to that brain unit that is connected to your phone.
[01:47:02.530 --> 01:47:08.530]  Now that power strip has four slots in it that are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.
[01:47:09.530 --> 01:47:14.530]  Now you open up the application on your phone and it will show you that you have plugged in that power strip.
[01:47:14.530 --> 01:47:15.530]  It knows it's there.
[01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:16.530]  The app has found it.
[01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:18.530]  The brain says, hey, this is here.
[01:47:18.530 --> 01:47:19.530]  What do you want me to do with it?
[01:47:19.530 --> 01:47:20.530]  You add it.
[01:47:20.530 --> 01:47:21.530]  You say that is in room one.
[01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:23.530]  You assign it to a room number.
[01:47:23.530 --> 01:47:26.530]  Now you've already got a room started with a piece of equipment in there.
[01:47:26.530 --> 01:47:28.530]  Now it's got four slots on it.
[01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:32.790]  You can assign each of those four slots to be a different piece of equipment.
[01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:35.790]  I would say slot one is my lights.
[01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:37.790]  It's really easy to scroll through.
[01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:38.790]  There's a little dial.
[01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:40.790]  It says what is plugged into slot one.
[01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:41.790]  Is it HVAC?
[01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:42.790]  Is it a light?
[01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:43.790]  Is it irrigation?
[01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:44.790]  It's real easy.
[01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:45.790]  It's a light.
[01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:46.790]  Cool, no problem.
[01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:47.790]  You just told it.
[01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:48.790]  Slot number one is a light.
[01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:49.790]  Slot number two is an air conditioner.
[01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:51.790]  Slot number three is a blower.
[01:47:51.790 --> 01:47:54.790]  And slot number four is a dehumidifier.
[01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:56.790]  We're just being hypothetical here.
[01:47:57.050 --> 01:48:02.050]  Once you've got all of the devices assigned to that power strip, you go to the room and
[01:48:02.050 --> 01:48:04.050]  set settings for the room.
[01:48:04.050 --> 01:48:06.050]  Our light is plugged into spot number one.
[01:48:06.050 --> 01:48:10.050]  You just go to lighting and you set a lighting schedule and you hit save.
[01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:15.050]  Now slot one will act accordingly to the schedule you have just set.
[01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:17.050]  The air conditioner is slot two.
[01:48:17.050 --> 01:48:21.050]  You just go to HVAC and you tell it I want it to stay this temperature in here.
[01:48:21.050 --> 01:48:25.050]  If it gets too hot, it'll fire up slot number two on that power strip.
[01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:29.310]  And each spot on that power strip will act as programmed.
[01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:31.310]  Now you're going to say how does it know what to do?
[01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:36.310]  Because there's another device in the box that hangs in the very center of the room.
[01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:42.310]  And this device has a light, temperature, and humidity sensor that takes a reading every
[01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:44.310]  15 seconds.
[01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:49.310]  So every 15 seconds it takes a fresh reading and it sends the information back to the brain
[01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:50.310]  unit.
[01:48:50.570 --> 01:48:54.570]  So it says, oh, okay, so it's 9 a.m., which means the lights need to be on.
[01:48:54.570 --> 01:48:56.570]  So I'll keep that switch on.
[01:48:56.570 --> 01:49:00.570]  It's gotten up to 84 degrees in here, so I need to turn on the air conditioner.
[01:49:00.570 --> 01:49:01.570]  And let's check on the humidity.
[01:49:01.570 --> 01:49:03.570]  Humidity is cool, so we don't need to turn on that device.
[01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:07.570]  And the fan, that goes with the air conditioner, so that came on too probably.
[01:49:07.570 --> 01:49:11.570]  So now your lights are on, the air conditioner's on, the fan's blowing around.
[01:49:11.570 --> 01:49:14.570]  That dehumidifier doesn't need to be on, so it's just chilling.
[01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:17.570]  And every 15 seconds that unit's going to keep taking measurements.
[01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:21.830]  And then once it sees that we've gotten down to the parameters we've programmed in, then
[01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:25.830]  it will turn off that air conditioner, that fan will turn off, the lights will stay on,
[01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:29.830]  and that dehumidifier will be right there on standby for when we need it.
[01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:35.830]  The unit I'm talking about also has the ability to measure the moisture content in your medium.
[01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:39.830]  If you're running Rockwell Cubes, if you're running Cocoa, if you're running Soil, whatever
[01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:45.830]  type of medium you're working in, this device has the ability to measure the moisture content
[01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:47.330]  in your medium.
[01:49:47.590 --> 01:49:53.590]  That means you can set up automated irrigation when the plants reach a certain dryness.
[01:49:53.590 --> 01:49:54.590]  How does that work?
[01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:55.590]  It's fairly easy.
[01:49:55.590 --> 01:49:58.590]  You put these little sticks in your medium and you calibrate them.
[01:49:58.590 --> 01:50:04.590]  They link up to the water content sensor controller, which wirelessly hooks up to the brain,
[01:50:04.590 --> 01:50:07.590]  which wirelessly relays to your phone.
[01:50:07.590 --> 01:50:12.590]  So that moisture content meter is constantly, every 15 seconds, taking a moisture meter
[01:50:12.590 --> 01:50:13.590]  in your medium.
[01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:17.850]  It's sending that reading up to the little brain, which is sending it back to the main
[01:50:17.850 --> 01:50:19.850]  brain, which is sending it to your phone.
[01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:23.850]  Now, if you have the equipment installed, you can go to that room, you can open the
[01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:28.850]  irrigation tab on your phone, and you can tell it to water that room when it gets to
[01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:33.850]  a certain dryness, and you can tell it to water for a certain amount of time or until
[01:50:33.850 --> 01:50:35.850]  it reaches a certain moisture level.
[01:50:35.850 --> 01:50:39.850]  Basically, the way you would do that, you would plug your irrigation pump into that
[01:50:40.110 --> 01:50:45.110]  power strip I spoke of earlier, or you can add another one of their specified power strips
[01:50:45.110 --> 01:50:49.110]  that syncs up wirelessly to the brain, which then syncs wirelessly to your phone.
[01:50:49.110 --> 01:50:51.110]  So you plug your irrigation pump into that.
[01:50:51.110 --> 01:50:57.110]  You go to the irrigation tab in the application and you tell it when to water.
[01:50:57.110 --> 01:51:01.610]  And then when the plants get dry, it simply sends electricity to plug number four or whichever
[01:51:01.610 --> 01:51:03.110]  plug you assigned as irrigation.
[01:51:03.110 --> 01:51:04.610]  It'll activate that.
[01:51:04.610 --> 01:51:05.610]  It will start watering.
[01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:10.870]  Once it gets wet enough, it will know because it's got a moisture content sensor in your
[01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:15.870]  medium, and it will say wet enough, and it'll send a signal to the brain, and it will discontinue
[01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:17.870]  powering your irrigation pump.
[01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:21.370]  Now, there are a lot of ways to irrigate your system.
[01:51:21.370 --> 01:51:23.370]  Maybe you're running a flood and drain system.
[01:51:23.370 --> 01:51:25.870]  Maybe that will just tell it when to flood and drain.
[01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:29.370]  Maybe you're running pots with an automated drip system like we talked about in another
[01:51:29.370 --> 01:51:30.370]  episode.
[01:51:30.370 --> 01:51:35.370]  However you do it, basically, you are just triggering the pump to come on, and it knows
[01:51:36.130 --> 01:51:41.130]  when to come on because we've got those moisture content sensors pressed into our medium at
[01:51:41.130 --> 01:51:42.630]  specified intervals.
[01:51:42.630 --> 01:51:47.130]  And the unit I'm talking about allows you to have six different water probes in different
[01:51:47.130 --> 01:51:49.130]  locations hooked up to one unit.
[01:51:49.130 --> 01:51:52.630]  So there are six wired probes that go back to one unit.
[01:51:52.630 --> 01:51:56.130]  That one unit then wirelessly sends the data back to the brain.
[01:51:56.130 --> 01:51:58.130]  That brain relays it to your phone.
[01:51:58.130 --> 01:52:04.130]  So once we've dialed in automated lighting, automated air conditioning, automated dehumidification
[01:52:04.890 --> 01:52:09.890]  and humidification, and now we've got automated irrigation, we have almost got a fully automated
[01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:16.890]  grow room with very basic equipment and honestly not a huge budget if you shop smart.
[01:52:16.890 --> 01:52:19.890]  I know it's exciting to get everything automated.
[01:52:19.890 --> 01:52:20.890]  You want it all dialed in.
[01:52:20.890 --> 01:52:21.890]  You want it just to happen.
[01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:23.890]  It's fun watching the machine happen.
[01:52:23.890 --> 01:52:26.890]  I would just stand in the corner of the grow room and look at a timer and go, so in about
[01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:29.890]  10 seconds, and you would know that that's going to switch off.
[01:52:29.890 --> 01:52:30.890]  That thing's going to go.
[01:52:30.890 --> 01:52:31.890]  That's going to happen.
[01:52:31.890 --> 01:52:32.890]  All the bells are going to happen.
[01:52:32.890 --> 01:52:33.890]  The whistles are going to happen.
[01:52:34.650 --> 01:52:35.650]  It's like a big game of mousetrap.
[01:52:35.650 --> 01:52:36.650]  It feels really great to watch.
[01:52:36.650 --> 01:52:42.890]  With all of that being said, some of my favorite advice is keep it simple, stupid.
[01:52:42.890 --> 01:52:45.890]  I know I'm calling you stupid, but that's the way the saying goes.
[01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:46.890]  Keep it simple, stoner.
[01:52:46.890 --> 01:52:47.890]  How's that?
[01:52:47.890 --> 01:52:48.890]  Does that feel better?
[01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:49.890]  Keep it simple, stoner.
[01:52:49.890 --> 01:52:51.890]  We don't need to make everything elaborate.
[01:52:51.890 --> 01:52:54.890]  A small grow does not need a lot of equipment.
[01:52:54.890 --> 01:53:01.650]  The more electronics you have, the more knobs and dials and bells and whistles you've got,
[01:53:01.650 --> 01:53:03.650]  the more shit can go wrong.
[01:53:04.410 --> 01:53:07.930]  If you've got a light and a fan and an air conditioner and some way to pull stale air
[01:53:07.930 --> 01:53:11.290]  and heat out of that room, you have got all you need.
[01:53:11.290 --> 01:53:13.570]  Of course, it is fun to trick out the room.
[01:53:13.570 --> 01:53:14.850]  It's fun to have accessories.
[01:53:14.850 --> 01:53:16.410]  It's fun to have toys.
[01:53:16.410 --> 01:53:21.170]  It's also going to improve your quality if you dial it in properly.
[01:53:21.170 --> 01:53:24.050]  Don't spend money on a bunch of toys just to have them.
[01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:25.410]  Think about what you need.
[01:53:25.410 --> 01:53:27.110]  Think about what's necessity.
[01:53:27.110 --> 01:53:31.410]  Think about the order in which you need your new toys.
[01:53:31.450 --> 01:53:35.290]  I'm going to skip off of my notes here and I'm going to say, instead of spending a whole
[01:53:35.290 --> 01:53:39.530]  bunch of money on some automation, why not buy yourself a better pH pen?
[01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:45.250]  I was going to talk later about pH pens and EC meters, but now's a good time.
[01:53:45.250 --> 01:53:49.410]  Instead of spending a lot of money on automation, you need a quality pH pen.
[01:53:49.410 --> 01:53:52.530]  Your plants are going to look like shit without proper pH.
[01:53:52.530 --> 01:53:55.650]  If you're putting together a budget and you're trying to include auto watering and you're
[01:53:55.650 --> 01:54:00.850]  trying to decide between a quality pH pen or maybe some fancy auto watering stuff, I
[01:54:00.850 --> 01:54:04.490]  highly recommend you go with a good pH pen.
[01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:06.130]  You need that from the beginning.
[01:54:06.130 --> 01:54:08.210]  You can add auto watering later.
[01:54:08.210 --> 01:54:10.310]  You can buy fancier toys later.
[01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:15.050]  If you're on a tight budget, get the necessities first and then we can expand in the future.
[01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:18.330]  If you don't have the right stuff, you're not going to have a quality product and it's
[01:54:18.330 --> 01:54:20.370]  all going to be a giant waste of money.
[01:54:20.370 --> 01:54:23.370]  All right, we've talked about controlling everything.
[01:54:23.370 --> 01:54:26.690]  Here's something that I want to include, but I'm not sure where it fits in, so I'm just
[01:54:26.690 --> 01:54:28.950]  going to tag it in right here.
[01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:30.990]  What about CO2 augmentation?
[01:54:30.990 --> 01:54:33.950]  Maybe you want to add CO2 to your grow room.
[01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:39.430]  This is probably going to require you making extra trips to either the grow store or the
[01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:40.590]  commercial gas place.
[01:54:40.590 --> 01:54:42.190]  Our local place here is called Airgas.
[01:54:42.190 --> 01:54:45.350]  You're going to have to buy or rent a container.
[01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:48.430]  You're going to have to get that refilled as frequently as you need it.
[01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:52.310]  I don't know how often it's going to need to be refilled in your environment.
[01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:54.310]  I don't know how well sealed your room is.
[01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:56.790]  I don't know how much CO2 your room starts with.
[01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:59.310]  I don't know how much CO2 you're trying to get it to.
[01:54:59.310 --> 01:55:02.310]  I don't know how often you'll need your containers filled.
[01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:08.390]  But for CO2 augmentation, you're going to need either those big tanks or a CO2 burner,
[01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:12.790]  which will have to be hardwired into your natural gas line.
[01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:14.630]  Tanks are probably the easiest way to go.
[01:55:14.630 --> 01:55:17.230]  You'll have to get the tanks, get them to the room.
[01:55:17.230 --> 01:55:20.390]  If you're not an able-bodied person, this could be challenging.
[01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:22.790]  The larger tanks are hard for me to move.
[01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:25.430]  The smaller tanks are not light either.
[01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:28.990]  So once you've got the tanks to the room, now you require a regulator.
[01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:31.390]  This screws onto the nozzle on the tank.
[01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:33.750]  It'll be obvious when you've got the tank and the regulator.
[01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:35.330]  You will see where that goes.
[01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:36.870]  You screw on the regulator.
[01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:38.430]  There are a couple of knobs.
[01:55:38.430 --> 01:55:39.710]  You've got to turn the...
[01:55:39.710 --> 01:55:42.390]  You've got to open the tank, turn the gas onto the tank.
[01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:44.430]  Now it's going to be flowing to the regulator.
[01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:49.670]  That regulator has a valve you can turn that will allow gas to flow through the lines.
[01:55:49.670 --> 01:55:52.270]  There are lines that attach to the regulator.
[01:55:52.270 --> 01:55:54.790]  Hang those lines high in your grow.
[01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:57.390]  I like to hang them right about the height of the lights.
[01:55:57.390 --> 01:56:01.030]  CO2 is a gas that is heavier than oxygen.
[01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:05.470]  That CO2 is going to pump through those lines and it will fall right down onto the plants
[01:56:05.470 --> 01:56:08.270]  and become available for the plants.
[01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:10.750]  Now how do we know how much CO2 is in the room?
[01:56:10.750 --> 01:56:12.310]  That's when CO2 gets expensive.
[01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:14.870]  You need a CO2 monitor.
[01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:20.030]  You can get a standalone CO2 monitor or this will work right into the automated system
[01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:21.390]  I was talking about earlier.
[01:56:21.390 --> 01:56:23.910]  There is a tab for CO2.
[01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:28.990]  We need a CO2 monitor, whether a standalone unit or a unit that's combined with our other
[01:56:28.990 --> 01:56:31.470]  monitoring and triggering system.
[01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:36.510]  Your more expensive CO2 monitors will also have a CO2 controller.
[01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:41.990]  These CO2 controllers work very similarly to the cap controllers I talked about earlier.
[01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:44.710]  There are a lot of different brands and styles available.
[01:56:44.710 --> 01:56:46.510]  Most of them will have a screen.
[01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:51.790]  On that screen you can set the level that you want the CO2 to reach in that room.
[01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:56.230]  Some of the more advanced models will also give you the option to set a schedule so that
[01:56:56.230 --> 01:57:00.350]  it comes on only when the lights are on and it does not come on when the lights are off.
[01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:03.510]  We don't need to add CO2 when the lights are off.
[01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:08.590]  You'll be able to set the level you want the CO2 to reach and you'll be able to set a schedule.
[01:57:08.590 --> 01:57:13.190]  This CO2 monitor has a cord hanging off of it which plugs into the wall or your power
[01:57:13.190 --> 01:57:14.190]  source.
[01:57:14.190 --> 01:57:20.590]  Now the plug that plugs into the wall has a piggyback that you can just plug your CO2
[01:57:20.590 --> 01:57:21.590]  regulator directly into.
[01:57:21.590 --> 01:57:27.390]  Now that thing is going to monitor the level of CO2 in the room and when it needs electricity
[01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:32.510]  triggered to the CO2 regulator it will just fire up and let the CO2 regulator know to
[01:57:32.510 --> 01:57:33.510]  come on.
[01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:37.830]  The CO2 regulator will pump gas down those lines that you've got hung above the canopy
[01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:41.830]  and then once that CO2 regulator says, oh it's enough, it'll turn that right off for you.
[01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:47.030]  So that is the best way, in my opinion, to set up CO2 in a small grow.
[01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:50.190]  That's very similar to the way it's done in a large commercial grow.
[01:57:50.190 --> 01:57:52.070]  We do the same lines above the canopy.
[01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:55.790]  Of course the lines are much longer and of course we're not running to the grow store
[01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:57.790]  to refill our canisters all the time.
[01:57:57.790 --> 01:58:03.350]  We have a truck that comes and they actually link up to a giant set of canisters outside.
[01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:07.890]  There are about a dozen six foot tall canisters outside that the truck fills for us.
[01:58:07.890 --> 01:58:12.410]  That lasts about half a week, maybe a little less depending on how many of the rooms are
[01:58:12.410 --> 01:58:13.790]  in full flower.
[01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:17.670]  But it's very similar to the way it's done in a commercial facility.
[01:58:17.670 --> 01:58:23.110]  Now if you don't want to use the CO2 monitor, I understand they're expensive, you can put
[01:58:23.110 --> 01:58:25.550]  the regulator on a timer.
[01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:29.730]  But when you do that, how do you know how much CO2 is in that room?
[01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:32.310]  How do you know if you even need to add CO2?
[01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:36.390]  How do you know if you haven't overdone it and you're not wasting CO2 at this point?
[01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:40.670]  I think a CO2 monitor is really worth the money you're going to spend because then you
[01:58:40.670 --> 01:58:43.530]  can save on CO2 in the long run.
[01:58:43.530 --> 01:58:44.830]  You won't be overdoing it.
[01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:46.470]  You won't be wasting CO2.
[01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:50.070]  You won't just be blasting CO2 into the room and wondering what's in there.
[01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:52.270]  I like knowing what's happening in my grow rooms.
[01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:56.830]  If they're big, if they're small, it's always better to take good notes and understand what
[01:58:56.830 --> 01:59:00.690]  is happening in there instead of just blasting something that you're paying a lot of money
[01:59:00.690 --> 01:59:04.070]  for and not understanding any type of results.
[01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:09.010]  So if I'm paying money for CO2, I would like to have a CO2 monitor just to see some sort
[01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:12.210]  of number go up, just to see my money turn into something.
[01:59:12.210 --> 01:59:16.930]  Even if it's just a number on that monitor, I want to see some kind of result.
[01:59:16.930 --> 01:59:21.450]  So that is my quick sidebar on CO2 augmentation and CO2 equipment.
[01:59:21.450 --> 01:59:24.330]  I feel like that fit perfectly right there.
[01:59:24.330 --> 01:59:28.450]  I feel like this series of Grow Lessons is off to a great start.
[01:59:28.450 --> 01:59:30.350]  We've got some goals in mind for the grow.
[01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:32.610]  We know what to expect from the grow.
[01:59:32.610 --> 01:59:34.030]  We know where to put the grow.
[01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:37.330]  We have a good understanding of what equipment we need for the grow.
[01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:39.450]  We've learned how to set up our lighting.
[01:59:39.450 --> 01:59:41.550]  We've learned how to set up our air conditioning.
[01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:45.670]  We've learned how to understand what type of humidifier and dehumidifier we might need.
[01:59:45.670 --> 01:59:48.550]  We've got a good understanding of how to set up our CO2.
[01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:51.550]  I think we are off to a really good start.
[01:59:51.550 --> 01:59:56.270]  In the next episode, I plan to talk about selecting the appropriate pots, soil, and
[01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:58.110]  nutrients for your grow.
[01:59:58.110 --> 02:00:02.790]  And after that, we'll work our way into integrated pest management.
[02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:05.910]  Before I start wrapping up the show, I really want to thank you guys for listening to these
[02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:06.910]  grow lessons.

[02:00:37.230 --> 02:00:39.870]  I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy Tommy Dubs.
[02:00:39.870 --> 02:00:43.230]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:00:45.230 --> 02:00:46.790]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:50.270]  It's time for episode 356 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:51.590]  Thank you for joining me.
[02:00:51.590 --> 02:00:55.190]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:00:55.190 --> 02:00:59.790]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella
[02:00:59.790 --> 02:01:04.990]  Dank Seed Company, and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:08.070]  You guys know I like to start these shows off by letting you know what I'm dabbing.
[02:01:08.070 --> 02:01:13.350]  I just took a big fat dab of some coffee nectar from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:15.670]  This is Alien Kush and Alien OG.
[02:01:15.670 --> 02:01:19.230]  It's described as dark roast coffee and watermelon candy.
[02:01:19.230 --> 02:01:21.070]  I've talked about this one on the show before.
[02:01:21.070 --> 02:01:23.670]  It absolutely does have that coffee flavor.
[02:01:23.670 --> 02:01:28.090]  Then the lingering aftertaste is a little bit of coffee with that sweet watermelon flavor.
[02:01:28.090 --> 02:01:30.150]  That is an accurate description there.
[02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:35.790]  A big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs and excellent work on the coffee nectar.
[02:01:35.790 --> 02:01:38.110]  This episode is going to be another grow lesson.
[02:01:38.110 --> 02:01:42.830]  This will be the fifth lesson in a long series of grow lessons I've got planned for you.
[02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:46.790]  This lesson will be more about selecting our equipment.
[02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:50.270]  At this point in the grow lessons, we should have a good goal for our grow.
[02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:52.870]  We should have a good place for our grow planned out.
[02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:56.750]  We should have a good idea of the equipment that we need, and also you should have a good
[02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:59.570]  idea of how to set up all of that gear.
[02:01:59.570 --> 02:02:04.470]  Now that we've got a good grow room running, let's talk about pots and soil, and then we'll
[02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:07.530]  work our way into our nutrient options.
[02:02:07.530 --> 02:02:11.710]  When it comes to selecting containers for our plants, we've got a lot of options.
[02:02:11.710 --> 02:02:13.430]  We can select net pots.
[02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:15.850]  We can select plastic nursery pots.
[02:02:15.850 --> 02:02:17.450]  We can use fabric pots.
[02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:21.350]  Also, there are waffle pots, also known as root pots, available.
[02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:26.630]  I've seen people get various sizes of bags of soil and cut the top off a bag of soil.
[02:02:26.690 --> 02:02:30.670]  You can pack that soil down into the bag really tight, and you can grow your plant directly
[02:02:30.670 --> 02:02:33.430]  in there if that's what you want to do.
[02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:36.270]  All of these methods have their pros and cons.
[02:02:36.270 --> 02:02:40.870]  The main thing to focus on when selecting your pots is drainage.
[02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:44.310]  Your pots need holes on the bottom.
[02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:47.230]  We're going to be watering and feeding our plants a lot of water.
[02:02:47.230 --> 02:02:50.910]  If there's nowhere for that excess water to go, it's just going to build up in your pot.
[02:02:50.910 --> 02:02:52.670]  You're going to create a mud puddle.
[02:02:52.670 --> 02:02:53.870]  Your plant will drown.
[02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:55.390]  The roots will drown in there.
[02:02:55.390 --> 02:02:56.670]  Your plant will die.
[02:02:56.670 --> 02:03:00.750]  We need plenty of holes for drainage in the bottom of our pot, no matter what type of
[02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:02.550]  pot we select.
[02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:05.390]  The net pots I talked about, those are mostly holes.
[02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:08.950]  Your nursery pots, they should come with holes already in them.
[02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:12.830]  The fabric pots, they provide plenty of drainage by being a fabric pot.
[02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:14.350]  The waffle pot does the same thing.
[02:03:14.350 --> 02:03:17.510]  You guys, when I'm saying a waffle pot, I mean those air pots.
[02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:21.390]  It looks like a waffle maker with a bunch of holes in it, and sometimes it's got rivets
[02:03:21.390 --> 02:03:26.150]  that you can undo, and you can unroll the pot and take the root ball out, and you can
[02:03:26.150 --> 02:03:30.350]  manipulate the root ball and then put the pot back on, or you can up-pot it at that
[02:03:30.350 --> 02:03:31.350]  time.
[02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:32.750]  But that's what I mean when I'm saying the waffle pots.
[02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:34.430]  They're air pots.
[02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:38.110]  It looks like somebody rolled them out with a waffle maker and then made a pot out of
[02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:39.110]  it.
[02:03:39.110 --> 02:03:41.310]  You'll see those when you go to the grocery store and you go shopping for pots.
[02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:43.030]  You'll know what I'm talking about.
[02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:46.510]  You can use whatever container you've got available to you.
[02:03:46.510 --> 02:03:49.430]  A lot of people like to go buy a bunch of five-gallon buckets.
[02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:53.510]  A lot of people like to recycle some sort of container that they use frequently.
[02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:57.550]  That is fine as long as you make some drainage holes.
[02:03:57.550 --> 02:04:02.190]  Quite often, I start my baby plants, whether seeds or clones, in beer cups.
[02:04:02.190 --> 02:04:06.730]  When football season starts or during the Super Bowl, those beer cups go on sale super
[02:04:06.730 --> 02:04:08.530]  cheap, stock up.
[02:04:08.530 --> 02:04:10.750]  Get yourself a few bags of beer cups.
[02:04:10.750 --> 02:04:14.110]  Then I stack them up about eight or 10 tall, and I use a drill.
[02:04:14.110 --> 02:04:17.590]  And I take a power drill with the long bit, and I poke a hole right through the bottom
[02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:20.030]  of the center of eight to 10 cups at a time.
[02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:21.030]  Zip, zip.
[02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:22.470]  I just did 20 cups.
[02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:23.550]  They've got holes in them.
[02:04:23.550 --> 02:04:25.110]  They've got one big drainage hole.
[02:04:25.110 --> 02:04:29.070]  Now, I'll also go through and make one or two more holes on the side of each cup after
[02:04:29.070 --> 02:04:30.070]  that.
[02:04:30.070 --> 02:04:31.630]  So I've got three solid drainage holes in a beer cup.
[02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:33.010]  That is plenty of drainage.
[02:04:33.010 --> 02:04:34.390]  You're not going to get any root rot.
[02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:36.750]  You're not going to get stagnant water in the bottom there.
[02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:38.310]  So that's a great way to segue.
[02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:40.590]  What are we going to segue into?
[02:04:40.590 --> 02:04:43.390]  Let's work our way into pot size.
[02:04:43.390 --> 02:04:44.770]  We've got plenty of drainage.
[02:04:44.770 --> 02:04:48.210]  Now we need a pot that is the appropriate size for our plant.
[02:04:48.210 --> 02:04:49.770]  I talked about beer cups.
[02:04:49.770 --> 02:04:54.890]  I like to start small plants in small pots, either a beer cup, maybe a four, maybe a six-inch
[02:04:54.890 --> 02:04:55.890]  net pot.
[02:04:55.890 --> 02:05:00.130]  The reason for that, why do you want to put a little tiny plant with a little tiny root
[02:05:00.130 --> 02:05:02.050]  zone in a big pot?
[02:05:02.050 --> 02:05:03.770]  Let's say you put it in a three-gallon pot.
[02:05:03.770 --> 02:05:07.610]  You've got all that extra space in there for those roots to just swim around in.
[02:05:07.610 --> 02:05:09.850]  That's extra space that you need to water.
[02:05:09.850 --> 02:05:13.090]  That's going to require more water, which will require more nutrients.
[02:05:13.410 --> 02:05:16.890]  Also, you're going to have to spread the plants out more if they're in larger pots, which
[02:05:16.890 --> 02:05:19.370]  means you may require more light.
[02:05:19.370 --> 02:05:22.690]  By keeping them in smaller pots, it keeps the garden more efficient.
[02:05:22.690 --> 02:05:26.290]  It keeps things more cost-effective, and it's easier to maintain.
[02:05:26.290 --> 02:05:30.010]  So I start my babies off in a little tiny pot, and when it's time, I transplant them
[02:05:30.010 --> 02:05:33.210]  into a one or three-gallon pot.
[02:05:33.210 --> 02:05:36.790]  Sometimes I'll finish my plants in that one or three-gallon pot.
[02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:41.610]  Other times, I will either skip the three-gallon and go straight into a seven-gallon pot, or
[02:05:41.610 --> 02:05:46.250]  I'll go from the cup into a three-gallon into a seven-gallon pot.
[02:05:46.250 --> 02:05:49.330]  Now let's talk about deciding which size pot to use.
[02:05:49.330 --> 02:05:52.590]  How do I know which size pot to transplant into?
[02:05:52.590 --> 02:05:56.010]  That all depends on how long that plant is going to live.
[02:05:56.010 --> 02:06:00.530]  It all depends on how big that plant is going to be in the end of its life cycle.
[02:06:00.530 --> 02:06:02.130]  How long are you going to veg?
[02:06:02.130 --> 02:06:04.330]  How long are you going to flower?
[02:06:04.330 --> 02:06:09.330]  The pot size will also play a huge factor into how frequently you need to water your
[02:06:09.330 --> 02:06:10.330]  garden.
[02:06:10.330 --> 02:06:13.090]  If you're running little one-gallon pots and you've got semi-large plants, you're going
[02:06:13.090 --> 02:06:14.850]  to have to water every day.
[02:06:14.850 --> 02:06:18.370]  If you've got semi-large plants, but you're running seven or 10-gallon pots, you can go
[02:06:18.370 --> 02:06:22.770]  in, dump a bunch of water in there, and you can leave those for two, three, sometimes
[02:06:22.770 --> 02:06:25.930]  four or five days, depending on how far into your cycles you are.
[02:06:25.930 --> 02:06:30.330]  So the pot size is going to make a huge difference on how frequently you water.
[02:06:30.330 --> 02:06:34.330]  Now let's talk about the size of the plant and the size of our container.
[02:06:34.330 --> 02:06:39.530]  When growing vigorous cannabis plants, I would suggest approximately a two to three-gallon
[02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:43.290]  pot for every 12 inches of plant growth.
[02:06:43.290 --> 02:06:47.810]  So if you've got a 12-inch tall plant, you want about a two or three-gallon pot.
[02:06:47.810 --> 02:06:49.970]  And I'm talking about your finished plant size.
[02:06:49.970 --> 02:06:53.970]  So if your plant's going to finish about 12, maybe 18 inches tall, that's when you want
[02:06:53.970 --> 02:06:55.570]  a two or three-gallon pot.
[02:06:55.570 --> 02:06:59.170]  Sometimes I'll get them about 24 inches tall in that three-gallon pot, but that's really
[02:06:59.170 --> 02:07:00.170]  pushing it.
[02:07:00.170 --> 02:07:04.850]  Then I'm watering every single day and they're thirsty at the start of every day.
[02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:10.610]  So if your plants are going to finish around 12, 18, maybe 24 inches at the maximum height,
[02:07:10.610 --> 02:07:13.050]  then you can go in a two to three-gallon pot.
[02:07:13.050 --> 02:07:15.810]  If you want to grow bigger plants, you need bigger pots.
[02:07:15.810 --> 02:07:19.770]  If you want to go to like a two-foot tall plant, that's when I would definitely recommend
[02:07:19.770 --> 02:07:22.010]  three to five-gallon pots.
[02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:23.210]  I like a five-gallon pot.
[02:07:23.210 --> 02:07:25.490]  A five-gallon pot is very versatile.
[02:07:25.490 --> 02:07:29.370]  Now if we want bigger plants, we obviously need to move into bigger pots.
[02:07:29.370 --> 02:07:34.210]  If you want about a 36-inch to a 42-inch plant, maybe just a little bit bigger, that's when
[02:07:34.210 --> 02:07:36.970]  you need to work with the five to seven-gallon pots.
[02:07:36.970 --> 02:07:40.530]  Now once you start going past five feet in an indoor grow, it starts kind of becoming
[02:07:40.530 --> 02:07:44.490]  a pain in the ass unless you're in a commercial grow with gavitas up on the ceiling and you've
[02:07:44.490 --> 02:07:46.010]  got all that ceiling height.
[02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:49.710]  But a five or six-foot tall plant is really as tall as I would recommend in an indoor
[02:07:49.710 --> 02:07:51.730]  grow unless you're really pushing it.
[02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:55.210]  If you're going to push out a big six-foot monster in the garage or something, that's
[02:07:55.210 --> 02:07:58.530]  when you want to push into a 10, maybe a 12-gallon pot.
[02:07:58.530 --> 02:08:02.530]  We just need to be sure to have enough root space to support these giant plants we're
[02:08:02.530 --> 02:08:03.990]  trying to grow.
[02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:07.830]  So try to select the appropriate container for the appropriate plant size you're going
[02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:09.110]  to work with.
[02:08:09.110 --> 02:08:13.550]  Also keep in mind that you can start small and you can always up-pot that plant.
[02:08:13.550 --> 02:08:15.770]  I don't recommend up-potting during flower.
[02:08:15.770 --> 02:08:17.230]  If it's critical, you can do that.
[02:08:17.230 --> 02:08:22.010]  I would like to see you transplant probably 10 days, maybe seven, 10 days, maybe five
[02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:24.110]  days before you put it into flower.
[02:08:24.110 --> 02:08:27.390]  But you can if you're good at it and you're not going to shock the plant at all.
[02:08:27.390 --> 02:08:30.990]  You can transplant it the day you flip into flower and you can put it into flower that
[02:08:30.990 --> 02:08:34.270]  day as long as you don't disrupt anything, as long as you don't piss that plant off,
[02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:35.350]  you will be okay.
[02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:39.510]  If you've given it any shock, if you're not experienced with transplanting, I would certainly
[02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:41.410]  give it a few days to recover.
[02:08:41.410 --> 02:08:44.390]  That way it's not getting transplanted and triggered into flower and trying to figure
[02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:46.470]  life out all at the same time.
[02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:48.230]  Give that plant a chance.
[02:08:48.230 --> 02:08:49.390]  So we've talked about drainage.
[02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:52.750]  We have talked about the height and size of a plant in a pot.
[02:08:52.750 --> 02:08:58.830]  Now let's talk about the pros and the cons of small pots versus large pots.
[02:08:58.830 --> 02:09:03.870]  Small pots, let's talk about the advantage of using small containers in our garden.
[02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:07.710]  With a smaller container, you don't need as much water, which means you don't need as
[02:09:07.710 --> 02:09:09.270]  much nutrient.
[02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:14.110]  The downside to that is you may need to water more frequently once the plants get a little
[02:09:14.110 --> 02:09:15.110]  larger.
[02:09:15.110 --> 02:09:20.350]  You may be in there watering twice a day if your pots are too small for your plant size.
[02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:24.810]  Another advantage of small pots is that you can fit the plants closer together.
[02:09:24.810 --> 02:09:26.790]  They don't take up as much space.
[02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:30.550]  The downfall to that is you don't have as much space for branching.
[02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:34.310]  If you're running a strain that just does one stick straight up and doesn't have a lot
[02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:39.530]  of side branching, maybe smaller pots are ideal because you can get them closer together.
[02:09:39.530 --> 02:09:42.790]  Another advantage to smaller pots are mobility.
[02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:44.470]  Some people aren't able-bodied.
[02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:48.550]  Some people need some assistance, and large pots may not be ideal for them.
[02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:53.310]  These small pots may be the way to go for people who aren't physically able to manage
[02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:55.550]  a five or seven gallon pot.
[02:09:55.550 --> 02:09:59.110]  Once these plants, once these pots are filled with medium, if we're going to put cocoa,
[02:09:59.110 --> 02:10:03.030]  if we're going to put soil, we're going to put a soilless mix, whatever we put in there,
[02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:07.150]  then you add a plant in there, then you add a gallon of water to a five gallon pot, that's
[02:10:07.150 --> 02:10:08.390]  got quite a bit of weight to it.
[02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:12.230]  If you're not an able-bodied person or if you've got anything slowing you down, that
[02:10:12.230 --> 02:10:13.230]  pot may not move.
[02:10:13.230 --> 02:10:15.910]  It may be stuck right there.
[02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:19.110]  One of the advantages of smaller pots is mobility.
[02:10:19.110 --> 02:10:20.870]  Now let's talk about larger pots.
[02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:26.470]  As we work our way into larger pots, we do have different advantages and disadvantages.
[02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:30.630]  One advantage of larger pots is less frequent watering.
[02:10:30.630 --> 02:10:34.750]  The disadvantage to that is it takes more to water at one time.
[02:10:34.750 --> 02:10:39.070]  Let's say we've got a seven gallon pot and the plant's in about week three of flower,
[02:10:39.070 --> 02:10:42.590]  and we've given that plant a chance to dry out a little bit, and it's actually thirsty
[02:10:42.590 --> 02:10:44.470]  and it's prime time for water.
[02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:50.110]  That plant may take at least a gallon, maybe a gallon and a half, possibly two full gallons
[02:10:50.110 --> 02:10:51.110]  of water.
[02:10:51.110 --> 02:10:55.830]  So it's going to take a lot more water to water that larger pot, but we're not going
[02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:58.910]  to need to water it for probably three days.
[02:10:58.910 --> 02:11:04.590]  Now my favorite advantage to running large seven gallon pots is bigger plants.
[02:11:04.590 --> 02:11:07.590]  In a bigger pot, you can get a bigger plant.
[02:11:07.590 --> 02:11:10.950]  There are a lot of things to consider when thinking about pot size.
[02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:14.630]  The main thing to think about is how big will your plant be in the end?
[02:11:14.630 --> 02:11:18.150]  You need a big enough home for your plant at its finished size.
[02:11:18.190 --> 02:11:22.910]  Now something to help you kind of think about pot size is plant count.
[02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:27.230]  In Colorado, we are strictly limited by the amount of plants we grow.
[02:11:27.230 --> 02:11:31.990]  It doesn't matter how big those plants are, but the number is what they go by.
[02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:35.910]  So somewhere like Colorado with a limited plant count, that's where we start growing
[02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:37.790]  gigantic plants.
[02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:41.790]  Instead of having a whole bunch of little plants under one light, we just put one plant
[02:11:41.790 --> 02:11:45.150]  under a light and veg it for a long time and then flower that out.
[02:11:45.150 --> 02:11:49.030]  We try to get one to two pounds out of one plant under one light.
[02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:53.910]  So plant count is a huge factor to keep in mind when thinking about pot size.
[02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:57.470]  Now if you don't have a plant count, your options are limitless.
[02:11:57.470 --> 02:12:01.030]  You can run little four inch by four inch Rockwool cubes.
[02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:05.830]  You can put 64 of those on a four by four tray and you can absolutely pull easily a
[02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:11.030]  pound underneath one light with 64 little plants and very little veg time.
[02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:14.670]  Or if you want bigger plants, you can do nine three gallon pots under a thousand watt
[02:12:14.670 --> 02:12:15.670]  light.
[02:12:15.670 --> 02:12:18.830]  Or if you want to go bigger, that's when I would start recommending like four, seven
[02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:20.510]  gallon pots under a thousand.
[02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:25.870]  Or if you want to go even bigger, maybe do one or two 10 gallons or maybe just one 12
[02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:28.830]  gallon pot underneath a thousand watt light.
[02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:33.110]  Those are some of the pros and cons or the advantages and disadvantages of larger and
[02:12:33.110 --> 02:12:34.350]  smaller pots.
[02:12:34.350 --> 02:12:36.230]  I talked about different types of pots.
[02:12:36.230 --> 02:12:39.070]  Let's go over some of the types of pots that are available.
[02:12:39.110 --> 02:12:41.230]  I talked about net pots.
[02:12:41.230 --> 02:12:44.490]  Net pots are usually available in four or six inch diameters.
[02:12:44.490 --> 02:12:45.490]  They aren't very deep.
[02:12:45.490 --> 02:12:47.630]  They're only about three or four inches deep.
[02:12:47.630 --> 02:12:52.150]  They look like somebody took a pot and then just cut a bunch of holes out of it to make
[02:12:52.150 --> 02:12:54.870]  it more like a mesh, more like a spaghetti strainer.
[02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:55.870]  That is a net pot.
[02:12:55.870 --> 02:13:00.690]  The advantage to that is that it gets a lot of airflow so you don't ever overwater the
[02:13:00.690 --> 02:13:07.030]  plants and you get plenty of wet and dry cycling and you get a lot of oxygen to your root zone.
[02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:10.710]  The downfall with the net pots is being so small and allowing all that airflow.
[02:13:10.710 --> 02:13:15.790]  They do require frequent watering once the plants start building a good root system in
[02:13:15.790 --> 02:13:16.790]  there.
[02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:19.590]  The next pots I talked about were our basic nursery pots.
[02:13:19.590 --> 02:13:22.110]  They're the plastic pots we are all familiar with.
[02:13:22.110 --> 02:13:23.750]  They come in a lot of different sizes.
[02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:24.910]  They're usually round.
[02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:25.910]  Some of them are square.
[02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:28.270]  They are available in black or white.
[02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:32.190]  If you're growing outdoors, I may recommend a white pot if it's available in the size
[02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:33.190]  you're looking for.
[02:13:33.190 --> 02:13:35.990]  Indoors, I don't think it makes a difference.
[02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:37.230]  Those pots are great.
[02:13:37.230 --> 02:13:39.770]  There's a reason why they are the industry standard.
[02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:44.710]  They come in any size and volume you need and they are also very affordable.
[02:13:44.710 --> 02:13:46.910]  Those are your basic nursery pots.
[02:13:46.910 --> 02:13:51.790]  The advantage to those is they don't dry out as quickly as a root pot or an air pot.
[02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:53.930]  You'll have more time between waterings.
[02:13:53.930 --> 02:14:00.390]  The disadvantage is less root growth and slower root growth because that restricted airflow.
[02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:02.230]  More airflow allows more root growth.
[02:14:02.230 --> 02:14:04.990]  It also allows the plants to dry more quickly.
[02:14:04.990 --> 02:14:08.750]  There's a balance there between plastic pots and fabric pots.
[02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:11.750]  That's a great way to segue into fabric pots.
[02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:13.950]  Fabric pots are available in many sizes.
[02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:18.610]  I've seen them as small as a half gallon and I've seen them as big as 200 gallons and everything
[02:14:18.610 --> 02:14:20.230]  in between.
[02:14:20.230 --> 02:14:23.510]  Let's talk about the advantages of the fabric pots.
[02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:26.430]  There is a lot of airflow to your root zone.
[02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:27.670]  I talked about it earlier.
[02:14:27.670 --> 02:14:30.290]  The roots love airflow.
[02:14:30.290 --> 02:14:33.270]  This also helps us prevent overwatering.
[02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:36.950]  Even if you do overwater, that pot's not going to hold it because it is fabric.
[02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:38.990]  That water will just run right off.
[02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:41.750]  That's really advantageous with the large pot.
[02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:42.990]  Something I should mention.
[02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:44.710]  Here's the disadvantage.
[02:14:44.710 --> 02:14:49.190]  Your air pots, your fabric pots are going to dry out much more quickly than a plastic
[02:14:49.190 --> 02:14:51.310]  pot because of all that airflow.
[02:14:51.310 --> 02:14:56.030]  I would suggest buying a little larger pot if you're going to run fabric pots.
[02:14:56.030 --> 02:15:01.330]  If you want to run five gallon plastic pots, consider seven gallon fabric pots for that
[02:15:01.330 --> 02:15:05.010]  extra time so that you don't have to water and your roots are just going to grow more
[02:15:05.010 --> 02:15:06.610]  quickly with those air pots.
[02:15:06.610 --> 02:15:10.050]  I would recommend that extra space just to be safe.
[02:15:10.050 --> 02:15:14.090]  The advantage to fabric pots is faster growing, more productive roots.
[02:15:14.090 --> 02:15:17.970]  The disadvantage is you're going to have to water more frequently.
[02:15:17.970 --> 02:15:21.450]  Let's talk about those air pots or the waffle pots I talked about.
[02:15:21.450 --> 02:15:23.410]  What are those things all about?
[02:15:23.410 --> 02:15:27.490]  Those are great for the same reason as the fabric pots because your roots get oxygen
[02:15:27.490 --> 02:15:29.490]  from all directions.
[02:15:29.490 --> 02:15:33.450]  Another great thing about them is they have got rivets on them.
[02:15:33.450 --> 02:15:37.930]  When it's time to up pot your pot, you don't have to lift that root ball up out of that
[02:15:37.930 --> 02:15:38.930]  pot.
[02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:42.690]  You can undo the rivets and that pot unwraps off of your root ball.
[02:15:42.690 --> 02:15:47.890]  Then you can gently pick that root ball up and set it into your up pot container.
[02:15:47.890 --> 02:15:51.730]  Once your plant is up potted, all you have to do is pop the rivets back in and you can
[02:15:51.730 --> 02:15:53.090]  reuse that pot.
[02:15:53.090 --> 02:15:54.090]  It is reusable.
[02:15:54.090 --> 02:15:57.050]  You didn't have to destroy it to get the plant out of there and the plant didn't have to
[02:15:57.050 --> 02:15:59.130]  get destroyed to get out of there.
[02:15:59.130 --> 02:16:01.330]  What's the advantage to those?
[02:16:01.330 --> 02:16:05.130]  The disadvantage is the same as the fabric pots.
[02:16:05.130 --> 02:16:08.370]  They require more frequent watering.
[02:16:08.370 --> 02:16:11.930]  That's a basic breakdown of the three most common types of pots you're going to run into
[02:16:11.930 --> 02:16:15.010]  when shopping for pots for your new grow.
[02:16:15.010 --> 02:16:20.130]  No matter what type of pot you select, you're going to need something under that to collect
[02:16:20.130 --> 02:16:21.130]  the runoff water.
[02:16:21.130 --> 02:16:25.610]  Keep in mind you'll need some sort of saucer or a tray underneath your pot, or maybe you're
[02:16:25.610 --> 02:16:28.050]  going to put all of your pots on a table.
[02:16:28.050 --> 02:16:30.370]  Just think about when you water, that's all going to run off.
[02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:32.530]  You need to collect that water somehow.
[02:16:32.530 --> 02:16:33.770]  It's got to go somewhere.
[02:16:33.770 --> 02:16:37.610]  Even if you're running it all off into a table, it's all got to get to a drain somehow.
[02:16:37.610 --> 02:16:41.290]  If you're just running it into saucers, you may need to get a shop vac and suck that water
[02:16:41.290 --> 02:16:42.290]  out of there.
[02:16:42.290 --> 02:16:45.690]  Don't leave those plants sitting in stagnant water for too long.
[02:16:45.690 --> 02:16:50.570]  All right, that basically covers the pots and the part that goes on the floor.
[02:16:50.570 --> 02:16:52.450]  I've been talking for about 16 minutes.
[02:16:52.450 --> 02:16:54.170]  My throat's getting a little dry.
[02:16:54.170 --> 02:16:55.330]  My head's getting a little clear.
[02:16:55.330 --> 02:16:56.570]  I'm going to press pause.
[02:16:56.570 --> 02:16:57.930]  I'm going to take a couple of dabs.
[02:16:58.010 --> 02:16:59.010]  I'm going to get a drink.
[02:16:59.010 --> 02:17:04.930]  And then when we get back, we will talk about selecting our medium for our new grow.
[02:17:04.930 --> 02:17:08.970]  While I'm taking a couple of dabs, I'm going to drop in a quick promotion for my Patreon
[02:17:08.970 --> 02:17:09.970]  campaign.
[02:17:09.970 --> 02:17:11.530]  This podcast is free.
[02:17:11.530 --> 02:17:15.650]  I do this podcast because I love cannabis and because I love helping people.
[02:17:15.650 --> 02:17:20.210]  I want to see you grow the best cannabis you can grow so you can provide that for yourself
[02:17:20.210 --> 02:17:22.330]  and people that rely on you.
[02:17:22.330 --> 02:17:26.610]  There are a few costs involved in producing and hosting a podcast.
[02:17:26.610 --> 02:17:31.250]  If you would like to help offset those costs and further my efforts in producing a quality
[02:17:31.250 --> 02:17:35.650]  show, you can do so by contributing to my Patreon campaign.
[02:17:35.650 --> 02:17:40.930]  For more information, visit patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[02:17:40.930 --> 02:17:46.970]  And that's P-A-T-R-E-O-N dot com slash growfromyourheart.
[02:17:46.970 --> 02:17:50.930]  This show will always be free, but if you would like to help, I would truly appreciate
[02:17:50.930 --> 02:17:51.930]  your support.
[02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:53.690]  Now, let's get right back to the show.
[02:17:53.690 --> 02:17:55.970]  All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[02:17:56.330 --> 02:17:59.890]  Got all my problems solved and I'm ready to continue with this show.
[02:17:59.890 --> 02:18:04.010]  Let's talk about the medium we're going to select for our new grow.
[02:18:04.010 --> 02:18:06.810]  Medium, that is what's going to go inside of our pot.
[02:18:06.810 --> 02:18:09.530]  That is what our plant is going to grow out of.
[02:18:09.530 --> 02:18:12.170]  Are you going to choose soil, a soilless mix?
[02:18:12.170 --> 02:18:13.890]  Are you going to grow in cocoa?
[02:18:13.890 --> 02:18:16.050]  Are you going to cook up a batch of super soil?
[02:18:16.050 --> 02:18:17.490]  Maybe you want some living soil.
[02:18:17.490 --> 02:18:22.390]  Maybe you want to do a TLO or a no-till sort of system, or maybe you're just going to grow
[02:18:22.390 --> 02:18:24.290]  in rock wool cubes.
[02:18:24.290 --> 02:18:27.770]  I know I don't have a lot of information in this episode for our hydro friends, but
[02:18:27.770 --> 02:18:34.450]  I will put together an entire hydro segment in the future for our waterborne friends.
[02:18:34.450 --> 02:18:38.290]  But for now, let's talk about soil and soilless mixes.
[02:18:38.290 --> 02:18:42.170]  A lot of people will tell you that they are growing in soil when actually they are growing
[02:18:42.170 --> 02:18:44.250]  in a soilless mix.
[02:18:44.250 --> 02:18:49.130]  Let's talk about the main differences between soil and a soilless mix.
[02:18:49.130 --> 02:18:54.270]  A soilless mix is right between a soil and a hydro grow.
[02:18:54.270 --> 02:18:57.370]  Soilless mix looks just like soil or dirt.
[02:18:57.370 --> 02:19:02.750]  The difference is there are no nutrients in a soilless mix.
[02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:06.630]  Soilless mixes are basically peat or cocoa based.
[02:19:06.630 --> 02:19:11.630]  Most of your soilless mixes will have plenty of aeration added to them like perlite or
[02:19:11.630 --> 02:19:13.630]  volcanic rock.
[02:19:13.630 --> 02:19:17.150]  Soilless mixes are great because they give us complete control over what we are feeding
[02:19:17.150 --> 02:19:18.150]  our plants.
[02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:20.430]  Now, that leads us right into soil.
[02:19:20.430 --> 02:19:26.670]  The main difference between a soilless blend and soil is the soil will have nutrients.
[02:19:26.670 --> 02:19:30.590]  Most of our store-bought soil mixes will have the same things as a soilless mix.
[02:19:30.590 --> 02:19:34.990]  It will have the perlite, it will have the peat moss in there, but it will also contain
[02:19:34.990 --> 02:19:41.470]  organically decomposed matter that make the soil rich in micro and macro nutrients.
[02:19:41.470 --> 02:19:45.110]  Now the advantage to that is that you don't need to feed your plants as heavily if at
[02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:46.110]  all.
[02:19:46.110 --> 02:19:49.310]  The disadvantage is you don't need to feed your plants.
[02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:52.150]  So you don't have control over what you're feeding your plants.
[02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:57.470]  There are already nutrients in that medium and you may not know exactly what's there.
[02:19:57.470 --> 02:20:01.950]  Also eventually those nutrients will be eaten up and you will need to either re-amend that
[02:20:01.950 --> 02:20:04.990]  soil or start using bottled nutrients.
[02:20:04.990 --> 02:20:08.490]  So that's the main difference between soil and a soilless mix.
[02:20:08.490 --> 02:20:11.850]  Most of us are going to go with a soilless mix.
[02:20:11.850 --> 02:20:16.130]  Most of the soil and soilless mixes available at your local growth shop will be suitable
[02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:17.130]  for you to grow in.
[02:20:17.130 --> 02:20:21.490]  I really try not to recommend specific products and specific brands, but I want to make this
[02:20:21.490 --> 02:20:23.170]  easy for everybody.
[02:20:23.170 --> 02:20:27.890]  Fox Farms Ocean Forest Soil is available everywhere and it will work for you.
[02:20:27.890 --> 02:20:29.210]  Some people are going to hate me for that.
[02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:30.770]  Some people are going to love me for that.
[02:20:30.770 --> 02:20:31.770]  It works.
[02:20:31.770 --> 02:20:32.770]  It is fine.
[02:20:32.770 --> 02:20:34.650]  If that's what's available to you, get that.
[02:20:34.650 --> 02:20:36.290]  It will do a good job.
[02:20:36.290 --> 02:20:38.810]  Also Roots Organics makes a quality soil.
[02:20:38.810 --> 02:20:41.290]  Again, I'm going to get lovers and haters for that.
[02:20:41.730 --> 02:20:43.970]  I'm trying to make this easy for new growers.
[02:20:43.970 --> 02:20:48.010]  If you want a big bale of soil, it's going to work very well for you.
[02:20:48.010 --> 02:20:54.130]  Sunshine Mix No. 4 is very cost effective and it is a quality product for a new grower.
[02:20:54.130 --> 02:20:58.530]  I really try to stay away from specific products, but those will work for a new grower and I
[02:20:58.530 --> 02:21:02.670]  know they are available at most reputable growth shops.
[02:21:02.670 --> 02:21:09.090]  If you choose to grow in a soil, eventually you may need to re-amend that soil or start
[02:21:09.090 --> 02:21:11.610]  watering with bottled nutrients.
[02:21:11.610 --> 02:21:16.970]  If you go with the Soilless Mix, you do need to start feeding nutrients right away.
[02:21:16.970 --> 02:21:22.410]  That's when we'll need to start thinking about organics or synthetics or boxes or bottles.
[02:21:22.410 --> 02:21:27.330]  Now that gives us a beautiful segue into pre-made soil mixes.
[02:21:27.330 --> 02:21:30.010]  A lot of people don't want to use bottled nutrients.
[02:21:30.010 --> 02:21:33.450]  They want to be more sustainable and they want to be more organic.
[02:21:33.450 --> 02:21:39.170]  The best options to do that are things like Super Soil or other living soils or TLO or
[02:21:39.170 --> 02:21:40.830]  a no-till setup.
[02:21:40.830 --> 02:21:44.670]  When you're using these pre-made soils, you don't need to add bottled nutrients because
[02:21:44.670 --> 02:21:49.410]  everything is already in the medium available to the plant as the plant needs it.
[02:21:49.410 --> 02:21:53.210]  Now let's talk briefly about what I mean by Super Soil or a living soil.
[02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:54.210]  They're very similar.
[02:21:54.210 --> 02:21:57.150]  Some people are going to argue with me, but we're going to put them in the same category
[02:21:57.150 --> 02:21:58.690]  for the sake of this talk.
[02:21:58.690 --> 02:22:01.850]  A Super Soil or a living soil is exactly that.
[02:22:01.970 --> 02:22:03.850]  It is a soil that is alive.
[02:22:03.850 --> 02:22:08.290]  It is filled with microbes and beneficial fungus and bacteria and all of the macro and
[02:22:08.290 --> 02:22:11.570]  micronutrients we need to get our plant through the growth cycle.
[02:22:11.570 --> 02:22:17.210]  A lot of times people add a few bonus items in there like some volcanic rock dust or whatever
[02:22:17.210 --> 02:22:19.810]  your secret ingredient may be.
[02:22:19.810 --> 02:22:22.810]  But a Super Soil, you basically gather all of your ingredients.
[02:22:22.810 --> 02:22:26.770]  The way I would do it, I would throw a large tarp on the ground in the garage.
[02:22:26.770 --> 02:22:29.250]  I would mix up all of the ingredients together.
[02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:33.650]  There's going to be bags of a base mix, which will probably be a soilless mix that you'll
[02:22:33.650 --> 02:22:35.450]  probably get from a grow store.
[02:22:35.450 --> 02:22:37.410]  And then a lot of amendments.
[02:22:37.410 --> 02:22:41.610]  Depending on your style of growing and what you want to do, the amendments will vary.
[02:22:41.610 --> 02:22:45.250]  If you've heard Sean and Jesse on the show before, you know we're probably going to put
[02:22:45.250 --> 02:22:46.810]  some alfalfa in there.
[02:22:46.810 --> 02:22:49.290]  We'll probably put some caranja in there.
[02:22:49.290 --> 02:22:51.250]  Probably be some neem cakes in there.
[02:22:51.250 --> 02:22:53.510]  It all just depends on the style of your grow.
[02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:57.730]  If you want to use animal products, you can put blood meal, bone meal, and fish meal in
[02:22:57.730 --> 02:22:58.730]  there.
[02:22:59.210 --> 02:23:00.610]  You can always put oyster shell stuff in there.
[02:23:00.610 --> 02:23:02.530]  You can put kelp meal in there.
[02:23:02.530 --> 02:23:06.330]  All that type of stuff will go into a Living Soil or a Super Soil.
[02:23:06.330 --> 02:23:08.970]  Then it will get mixed up and put into a container.
[02:23:08.970 --> 02:23:10.590]  Then a little water will be added.
[02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:12.330]  That will make everything come to life in there.
[02:23:12.330 --> 02:23:15.490]  You'll start seeing a little white fungus on top of your soil.
[02:23:15.490 --> 02:23:16.570]  That is a good thing.
[02:23:16.570 --> 02:23:18.890]  That is why we call it Living Soil.
[02:23:18.890 --> 02:23:21.650]  That's a Living Soil or a Super Soil idea.
[02:23:21.650 --> 02:23:23.810]  You can find plenty of recipes online.
[02:23:23.810 --> 02:23:28.430]  If you Google Subcool's Super Soil recipe, you will find it, I promise.
[02:23:28.430 --> 02:23:30.790]  You can also go to Build A Soil's website.
[02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:35.270]  I'm sure they will give you plenty of information on building a Living Soil.
[02:23:35.270 --> 02:23:40.870]  Now let me talk briefly about the pros and cons of a Living Soil or a Super Soil.
[02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:45.790]  First, it's a lot of ingredients to gather, but they are affordable.
[02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:49.350]  They're probably more cost-effective than buying a bunch of bottles.
[02:23:49.350 --> 02:23:50.590]  You gather your ingredients.
[02:23:50.590 --> 02:23:54.390]  Then you've got to mix them yourself, which is kind of fun if you're into that.
[02:23:54.390 --> 02:23:56.750]  If you're not into that, it's a giant pain in the ass.
[02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:57.990]  I think it's fun.
[02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:59.870]  You lay out a giant tarp in the garage.
[02:23:59.870 --> 02:24:01.830]  You weigh out and measure out your stuff.
[02:24:01.830 --> 02:24:02.830]  You mix it up.
[02:24:02.830 --> 02:24:03.830]  You put it in containers.
[02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:04.830]  It's a good time.
[02:24:04.830 --> 02:24:05.830]  So there's work to it.
[02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:07.390]  Then it's got to cook.
[02:24:07.390 --> 02:24:09.110]  It needs a specified time.
[02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:13.710]  Depending on your ingredients, it needs about 30, maybe 45 days.
[02:24:13.710 --> 02:24:15.030]  So it needs prep time.
[02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:16.550]  That is the downfall.
[02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:21.390]  Another downfall is a lot of those organic amendments are not completely reliable on
[02:24:21.390 --> 02:24:24.430]  their nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus levels.
[02:24:24.430 --> 02:24:27.890]  We're adding a bunch of things to a bunch of other things and cooking it.
[02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:31.690]  It may come out a little richer or a little lighter than we expected.
[02:24:31.690 --> 02:24:36.130]  If you're not an experienced grower, a super soil may throw your plants off and you will
[02:24:36.130 --> 02:24:39.310]  have no idea how to adjust and correct that.
[02:24:39.310 --> 02:24:43.310]  So that is one of the major downfalls to a living soil for a new grower.
[02:24:43.310 --> 02:24:47.010]  If you mix everything properly and you know how to pay attention to the plants, a living
[02:24:47.010 --> 02:24:51.210]  soil and a super soil can do beautiful things for your garden.
[02:24:51.210 --> 02:24:56.250]  Now if you really want to step your game up, you can go TLO, which means true living organics,
[02:24:56.250 --> 02:24:57.250]  or you can go no-till.
[02:24:57.610 --> 02:24:58.610]  They're both very similar.
[02:24:58.610 --> 02:25:01.930]  I honestly don't have a lot of experience in either one.
[02:25:01.930 --> 02:25:03.450]  That's Sean and Jesse's department.
[02:25:03.450 --> 02:25:06.730]  They both crush it with the TLO and with the living organic stuff.
[02:25:06.730 --> 02:25:09.490]  But that's when you start involving worms into your grow.
[02:25:09.490 --> 02:25:10.490]  That's when...
[02:25:10.490 --> 02:25:14.050]  So with the no-till garden, we're never taking anything to the trash.
[02:25:14.050 --> 02:25:18.450]  We're basically harvesting a plant and then where the hole from that plant was, we put
[02:25:18.450 --> 02:25:22.810]  another plant and then backfill it with a little bit of compost that we've made ourselves.
[02:25:22.810 --> 02:25:27.330]  The waste from the plant, after we harvest it, goes back into our compost.
[02:25:27.330 --> 02:25:30.970]  So we reuse almost everything in a no-till environment.
[02:25:30.970 --> 02:25:35.370]  Again with the TLO and a no-till environment, it does take some time to prepare and set
[02:25:35.370 --> 02:25:37.050]  up that soil.
[02:25:37.050 --> 02:25:41.410]  One good thing about a no-till, all of my no-till friends tell me it gets better with
[02:25:41.410 --> 02:25:42.650]  every grow.
[02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:44.650]  They bought everything for the no-till grow.
[02:25:44.650 --> 02:25:48.890]  They set it up one time and they got it going and they got it dialed in and they grew a
[02:25:48.890 --> 02:25:51.290]  crop and those plants came out pretty well.
[02:25:51.530 --> 02:25:55.170]  They pulled out that root ball, they put that in the compost bin, they put a fresh plant
[02:25:55.170 --> 02:26:00.210]  in there, they added some compost, they re-amended, they put some cover crop on the pot and then
[02:26:00.210 --> 02:26:01.210]  it grew in there.
[02:26:01.210 --> 02:26:02.210]  The whole plant grew again.
[02:26:02.210 --> 02:26:04.010]  They said that second crop was better.
[02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:08.250]  The last time Frosty was here, I think he said he was on his seventh run with his no-till
[02:26:08.250 --> 02:26:10.330]  crop and it is getting better every time.
[02:26:10.330 --> 02:26:13.730]  Imagine if every time you grew in the dirt, it got better.
[02:26:13.730 --> 02:26:19.130]  A normal soil or a soilless mix guy is either throwing that away or trying to find some
[02:26:19.130 --> 02:26:20.990]  way to recycle it and it's a struggle.
[02:26:21.550 --> 02:26:26.990]  The advantage there of the no-till is you are recycling all of your grow to go back
[02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:27.990]  into your grow.
[02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:33.190]  It is very sustainable and it is 100% organic if you keep it that way.
[02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:38.150]  The downfall is it takes a lot of time to set up and it's 100% organic.
[02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:44.070]  If you have a problem, you have to research 100% organic methods to correct your issues.
[02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:48.630]  You can't go to the store, buy a bottle of something, shake it up, apply it to your plants
[02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:50.290]  and think you've solved your problem.
[02:26:50.290 --> 02:26:53.290]  It's not so easy in a no-till environment.
[02:26:53.290 --> 02:26:57.690]  It looks like it takes a little more thinking, but it also looks like it is much more rewarding.
[02:26:57.690 --> 02:27:01.890]  My friends that grow the no-till weed, it really tastes really good.
[02:27:01.890 --> 02:27:06.290]  The pros of the no-till and the TLO grow is it's organic.
[02:27:06.290 --> 02:27:07.490]  You know what you're putting in there.
[02:27:07.490 --> 02:27:10.650]  You know that you're going to have a clean, tasty product.
[02:27:10.650 --> 02:27:12.810]  Also, it's being self-sustained.
[02:27:12.810 --> 02:27:14.610]  You don't have to introduce a bunch of funky shit.
[02:27:14.610 --> 02:27:16.250]  You don't have to keep buying products.
[02:27:16.250 --> 02:27:17.930]  There are no bottles to throw away.
[02:27:17.930 --> 02:27:22.610]  The downside is it takes a little while to get your medium started before you can even
[02:27:22.610 --> 02:27:24.170]  put a plant in there.
[02:27:24.170 --> 02:27:29.810]  You guys, I honestly don't have enough experience with a super soil, a living soil, a TLO or
[02:27:29.810 --> 02:27:32.330]  a no-till grow to talk like I'm an expert.
[02:27:32.330 --> 02:27:35.490]  I'm trying to give you the best of my knowledge from what I understand.
[02:27:35.490 --> 02:27:39.490]  I'm sure there is more to think about when it comes to those types of grows.
[02:27:39.490 --> 02:27:42.290]  Those are more advanced techniques in my opinion.
[02:27:42.290 --> 02:27:44.570]  Now we've talked about soil and soilless mixes.
[02:27:44.570 --> 02:27:46.290]  We've talked about living soils.
[02:27:46.330 --> 02:27:48.330]  Let's talk about the exact opposite.
[02:27:48.330 --> 02:27:49.930]  Let's talk about cocoa.
[02:27:49.930 --> 02:27:52.970]  I really like growing in cocoa.
[02:27:52.970 --> 02:27:55.250]  I have a lot of experience growing in cocoa.
[02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:59.010]  If I were to set up a commercial grow today and I had a budget that I could do whatever
[02:27:59.010 --> 02:28:01.610]  I wanted with, we would run a cocoa setup.
[02:28:01.610 --> 02:28:04.890]  It would be cocoa with a lot of perlite.
[02:28:04.890 --> 02:28:09.050]  I like cocoa because cocoa doesn't hold onto any nutrients.
[02:28:09.050 --> 02:28:11.290]  I also like cocoa because it is inert.
[02:28:11.290 --> 02:28:14.490]  It does not contain any nutrients when you buy it.
[02:28:14.690 --> 02:28:17.930]  It is just clean, medium that the plants can hang out in.
[02:28:17.930 --> 02:28:20.530]  The roots really seem to be comfortable in there.
[02:28:20.530 --> 02:28:23.130]  You get to control everything when it comes to cocoa.
[02:28:23.130 --> 02:28:25.570]  You get to control every nutrient that goes in there.
[02:28:25.570 --> 02:28:28.370]  I really like the wet and dry time with cocoa.
[02:28:28.370 --> 02:28:32.610]  A well aerated cocoa, wet and dry time is beautiful.
[02:28:32.610 --> 02:28:35.330]  One thing about cocoa, it kind of works like hydro.
[02:28:35.330 --> 02:28:38.050]  I'm able to feed my cocoa grow twice a day.
[02:28:38.050 --> 02:28:42.210]  I can pump nutrients through that grow two times every day, which means those plants
[02:28:42.210 --> 02:28:44.330]  are really eating heavily.
[02:28:44.370 --> 02:28:49.010]  A couple of tips if you choose cocoa, make sure you rinse your cocoa before you put your
[02:28:49.010 --> 02:28:50.010]  plants in it.
[02:28:50.010 --> 02:28:51.010]  Wash it off.
[02:28:51.010 --> 02:28:52.010]  It is dirty.
[02:28:52.010 --> 02:28:53.730]  I'm not sure where you got your cocoa from.
[02:28:53.730 --> 02:28:55.130]  Who knows where they got it from?
[02:28:55.130 --> 02:28:56.650]  Who knows where it was stored?
[02:28:56.650 --> 02:28:57.650]  Just rinse it.
[02:28:57.650 --> 02:29:00.890]  If you can just fill a pot with it, if that's what you need to do, put it in a giant pot
[02:29:00.890 --> 02:29:04.250]  and then just run a bunch of water through it to where you're running the water clean.
[02:29:04.250 --> 02:29:06.850]  That would really be beneficial for you.
[02:29:06.850 --> 02:29:11.890]  Also, when you're running cocoa, you may need more cow mag than you're used to.
[02:29:11.890 --> 02:29:14.330]  Earlier I said nothing stays in the cocoa.
[02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:16.290]  That means that the cow mag just falls right out.
[02:29:16.290 --> 02:29:19.530]  When you've got runoff water, that cow mag went right on out with that.
[02:29:19.530 --> 02:29:22.730]  It's not hanging out in the medium like it would if you had soil.
[02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:24.770]  There's nothing for it to hang onto in the cocoa.
[02:29:24.770 --> 02:29:28.410]  The cocoa doesn't grab it like a soil or soilless mix would.
[02:29:28.410 --> 02:29:32.330]  So a couple of basic tips if you choose to go in cocoa would be make sure you rinse it.
[02:29:32.330 --> 02:29:33.330]  It may be salty.
[02:29:33.330 --> 02:29:36.650]  You don't want to put your plants in that salty environment.
[02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:41.850]  Then increase your cow mag and possibly you may need to increase your overall nutrient
[02:29:41.850 --> 02:29:42.850]  regimen.
[02:29:42.850 --> 02:29:45.570]  I recommend feeding every day when you're growing in cocoa.
[02:29:45.570 --> 02:29:50.470]  If you're in soil or a soilless mix, you may be only feeding once a week or twice a week.
[02:29:50.470 --> 02:29:53.670]  You can feed every single day in cocoa.
[02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:58.490]  Every time you water those plants, put some nutrients in there if you're growing in cocoa.
[02:29:58.490 --> 02:30:02.730]  A lot of times in the big grow, we would give them a big watering, a big feeding to start
[02:30:02.730 --> 02:30:03.730]  the day.
[02:30:03.730 --> 02:30:04.730]  They would get base nutrients.
[02:30:04.730 --> 02:30:05.730]  They would get cow mag.
[02:30:05.810 --> 02:30:06.810]  They would get bloom booster.
[02:30:06.810 --> 02:30:09.170]  They would get their whatever else we were feeding them that day.
[02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:10.170]  We had a whole list of stuff.
[02:30:10.170 --> 02:30:11.330]  We'd feed the plants.
[02:30:11.330 --> 02:30:13.450]  So we'd feed them that early in the morning.
[02:30:13.450 --> 02:30:17.770]  Then right before we leave a lot of times, we would just shoot just a small feed of just
[02:30:17.770 --> 02:30:21.370]  base nutrients and cow mag through at the end of the day just to make sure the plants
[02:30:21.370 --> 02:30:23.570]  were wet by the time we got there in the morning.
[02:30:23.570 --> 02:30:25.670]  And they really liked being fed twice a day.
[02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:28.010]  That first time we would feed them a big fat meal.
[02:30:28.010 --> 02:30:31.330]  The second time, just base nudes and cow mag.
[02:30:31.330 --> 02:30:35.890]  So the benefit to growing in cocoa is you get to control all of the nutrients.
[02:30:35.890 --> 02:30:40.050]  In the middle, I don't know if it's a pro or con, it dries up more quickly than soil.
[02:30:40.050 --> 02:30:41.570]  So you may need to water more often.
[02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:45.490]  I like that because that means I get to feed more frequently.
[02:30:45.490 --> 02:30:50.610]  Now the con to growing in cocoa, it's not as forgiving as soil or a soilless mix.
[02:30:50.610 --> 02:30:52.290]  It's acting more like hydro.
[02:30:52.290 --> 02:30:56.210]  So if you make a mistake, you're going to see it immediately.
[02:30:56.210 --> 02:30:58.250]  There's no buffer to fix your mistakes.
[02:30:58.250 --> 02:31:02.130]  So if you overfeed in cocoa, those plants will show you right away.
[02:31:02.130 --> 02:31:07.210]  Now let's move into the last medium that I have on my list to talk about, and that is
[02:31:07.210 --> 02:31:08.930]  rockwool.
[02:31:08.930 --> 02:31:11.450]  Rockwool are those cubes that you see at the growth store.
[02:31:11.450 --> 02:31:13.650]  They just look like a giant sponge.
[02:31:13.650 --> 02:31:14.810]  They're great for hydro.
[02:31:14.810 --> 02:31:17.370]  They are great for a commercial environment.
[02:31:17.370 --> 02:31:18.370]  They are very cost-effective.
[02:31:18.370 --> 02:31:21.210]  They are very easy to dispose of.
[02:31:21.210 --> 02:31:24.370]  They work very much like cocoa.
[02:31:24.370 --> 02:31:26.890]  They do not have any nutrients in them.
[02:31:26.890 --> 02:31:29.410]  They do not hold any nutrients.
[02:31:29.410 --> 02:31:32.990]  They also have a very nice wet and dry time.
[02:31:32.990 --> 02:31:36.410]  They come in a very large variety of sizes.
[02:31:36.410 --> 02:31:38.090]  You can get them in a one by one cube.
[02:31:38.090 --> 02:31:40.890]  So you can cut your clone into a little one by one.
[02:31:40.890 --> 02:31:46.050]  Then they also make them in a four by four, a six by six, just about any size you need.
[02:31:46.050 --> 02:31:49.570]  And you can grow a huge plant in a small rockwool cube.
[02:31:49.570 --> 02:31:52.410]  You can cut your clone into a one inch rockwool cube.
[02:31:52.410 --> 02:31:56.210]  And then the four by four has a little spot where that one inch will set right into it.
[02:31:56.530 --> 02:31:59.850]  And then the eight inch has a little slot cut into it where that four by four fits right
[02:31:59.850 --> 02:32:00.850]  into it.
[02:32:00.850 --> 02:32:04.530]  So you can just keep up potting just by setting it on top of another one.
[02:32:04.530 --> 02:32:08.170]  That really saves a lot of work in a large commercial grow.
[02:32:08.170 --> 02:32:12.970]  And I probably shouldn't forget that they also offer cocoa in the same types of slabs.
[02:32:12.970 --> 02:32:17.170]  You put your clone into a small little cocoa slab and then it fits right into a larger,
[02:32:17.170 --> 02:32:18.850]  which fits into a larger cocoa slab.
[02:32:18.850 --> 02:32:20.450]  It kind of looks like a volcano.
[02:32:20.450 --> 02:32:22.570]  I should not forget about that.
[02:32:22.570 --> 02:32:26.090]  Those are great for hydro type applications.
[02:32:26.090 --> 02:32:28.930]  All right, you guys, I feel like that is enough podcasting for one episode.
[02:32:28.930 --> 02:32:30.850]  We talked about selecting containers.
[02:32:30.850 --> 02:32:32.690]  We talked about selecting your medium.
[02:32:32.690 --> 02:32:37.770]  In the next episode, we will talk about selecting nutrients for your new grow.
[02:32:37.770 --> 02:32:39.330]  Do you want to go organic?
[02:32:39.330 --> 02:32:40.730]  Do you want to go synthetic?
[02:32:40.730 --> 02:32:43.250]  We will talk about it in depth on the next episode.
[02:32:43.250 --> 02:32:45.770]  I want to thank you guys again for listening.
[02:32:45.770 --> 02:32:48.010]  Don't forget about the Patreon campaign.
[02:32:48.010 --> 02:32:51.970]  You can find that at patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[02:32:51.970 --> 02:32:54.330]  I would appreciate your support there.
[02:32:54.330 --> 02:32:56.970]  I'll be back in just a few days with a fresh new episode.
[02:32:56.970 --> 02:33:00.250]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Della Luna Glass.
[02:33:00.250 --> 02:33:06.570]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:33:06.570 --> 02:33:07.730]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[02:33:07.730 --> 02:33:11.890]  It's time for episode 357 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:33:11.890 --> 02:33:15.050]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:33:15.050 --> 02:33:19.970]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find
[02:33:19.970 --> 02:33:23.610]  them at dankseed.store.
[02:33:23.610 --> 02:33:26.490]  I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[02:33:26.490 --> 02:33:30.730]  Today, I'm taking dabs of Fatso 2 Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[02:33:30.730 --> 02:33:34.130]  This is a combination of GMO and Legend OG.
[02:33:34.130 --> 02:33:39.290]  On the package, it is described as dark roast coffee, garlic, and fuel.
[02:33:39.290 --> 02:33:43.570]  I would absolutely agree with that description, but I may add a little bit of underarm and
[02:33:43.570 --> 02:33:45.570]  onions to that description.
[02:33:45.570 --> 02:33:49.970]  There's kind of a rank after smell to this that I know it sounds disgusting, but it is
[02:33:49.970 --> 02:33:51.390]  really inviting.
[02:33:51.390 --> 02:33:54.830]  If I opened up this concentrate and let you smell it, you'd go, ooh, that is gross.
[02:33:54.830 --> 02:33:56.550]  Can I have a dab?
[02:33:56.550 --> 02:34:01.910]  And then when you dab it, it leaves this really savory aftertaste that I really enjoy, and
[02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:04.150]  it also gives me crazy cotton mouth.
[02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:08.710]  I haven't had a concentrate give me cotton mouth like that in a long time.
[02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:11.230]  It's also got a really nice heavy high.
[02:34:11.230 --> 02:34:12.750]  It sat me back in the chair.
[02:34:12.750 --> 02:34:15.770]  It made me just kind of sit here and stare into the computer screen for a couple of seconds
[02:34:15.770 --> 02:34:16.770]  before I started recording.
[02:34:16.770 --> 02:34:22.290]  It's got a really nice buzz, and I really enjoy the Fatso 2 Live Batter from Green Dot
[02:34:22.290 --> 02:34:23.290]  Labs.
[02:34:23.290 --> 02:34:27.610]  I've got a lot of information for you in this podcast, so let's get right to it.
[02:34:27.610 --> 02:34:32.530]  This is going to be the sixth grow lesson in a long series of lessons.
[02:34:32.530 --> 02:34:36.050]  In this lesson, we're going to talk about selecting your nutrients.
[02:34:36.050 --> 02:34:39.810]  If you're a new listener, if you're a new grower, I suggest you head back to episode
[02:34:39.810 --> 02:34:42.490]  351 and start listening there.
[02:34:42.490 --> 02:34:46.450]  That will give you a solid foundation on setting goals for your grow, selecting your
[02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:49.370]  space and selecting your equipment for the grow.
[02:34:49.370 --> 02:34:53.690]  If you're an experienced grower or if you've been listening, let's get right into selecting
[02:34:53.690 --> 02:34:57.330]  nutrients for your new grow.
[02:34:57.330 --> 02:35:01.690]  Selecting nutrients or fertilizers for your new garden can be very challenging.
[02:35:01.690 --> 02:35:04.790]  It can also be very intimidating.
[02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:10.250]  Nutrients and fertilizers are the most heavily advertised product in the grow store.
[02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:14.930]  After you have the grow set up, your nutrients will probably be the most expensive recurring
[02:35:14.930 --> 02:35:17.290]  cost you have in your grow.
[02:35:17.290 --> 02:35:23.210]  I'm going to do my best to guide you on selecting nutrients without recommending specific brands,
[02:35:23.210 --> 02:35:25.410]  without recommending specific products.
[02:35:25.410 --> 02:35:27.290]  I'm trying not to pitch anything here.
[02:35:27.290 --> 02:35:32.290]  I'm not trying to steer you any specific direction, but I want to give you a good idea and a good
[02:35:32.290 --> 02:35:37.050]  understanding of what to think about when you are trying to customize your garden for
[02:35:37.050 --> 02:35:38.330]  yourself.
[02:35:38.410 --> 02:35:43.010]  There are thousands of nutrient companies out there and countless ways to amend and
[02:35:43.010 --> 02:35:44.610]  fertilize soil.
[02:35:44.610 --> 02:35:49.970]  It may take a little bit of trial and error to dial in what works best for you.
[02:35:49.970 --> 02:35:54.370]  Don't be afraid to run one nutrient brand for your first grow and a completely different
[02:35:54.370 --> 02:35:56.490]  line for your second grow.
[02:35:56.490 --> 02:36:00.610]  Take notes when you do things like that, and then you can compare what you liked better.
[02:36:00.610 --> 02:36:04.290]  Maybe one nutrient company will give you better flavors, one nutrient company is going to
[02:36:04.290 --> 02:36:07.770]  give you better yields, and one will probably give you better potency.
[02:36:07.770 --> 02:36:12.050]  If you can find the company that does all three of those and works with your grow style,
[02:36:12.050 --> 02:36:13.530]  that's what you want to do.
[02:36:13.530 --> 02:36:17.250]  Also, the cannabis industry is filled with egos.
[02:36:17.250 --> 02:36:21.130]  Don't let anybody tell you you are choosing the wrong line because it's not what they
[02:36:21.130 --> 02:36:22.130]  choose.
[02:36:22.130 --> 02:36:26.450]  As long as you are satisfied with the outcome and you are okay with the ethics of the company
[02:36:26.450 --> 02:36:30.810]  you are giving your money to, you can use whatever nutrients you want.
[02:36:30.810 --> 02:36:34.130]  That is the beauty of building your own grow.
[02:36:34.130 --> 02:36:39.530]  Now let's talk about some of the options when it comes to selecting nutrients for our grow.
[02:36:39.530 --> 02:36:42.930]  When you go to the grow store, the number one thing they're going to pitch to you is
[02:36:42.930 --> 02:36:45.090]  bottled nutrients.
[02:36:45.090 --> 02:36:48.050]  Grow stores love to sell bottled nutrients.
[02:36:48.050 --> 02:36:50.490]  There are different types of bottled nutrients available.
[02:36:50.490 --> 02:36:53.210]  We've got salt-based bottled nutrients.
[02:36:53.210 --> 02:36:56.730]  Most of your big brand names are salt-based.
[02:36:56.730 --> 02:36:59.490]  There are also organic bottled nutrients available.
[02:36:59.490 --> 02:37:02.890]  A lot of companies boast about having fully organic lines.
[02:37:02.890 --> 02:37:04.490]  That's always an option.
[02:37:04.490 --> 02:37:09.770]  Also, there are veganic options available, which means there are no animal products in
[02:37:09.770 --> 02:37:11.850]  an organic lineup.
[02:37:11.850 --> 02:37:15.930]  And of course, we can always do a combination of organics and synthetics.
[02:37:15.930 --> 02:37:19.970]  There's always a nice balance to find there and make sure that none of our synthetic salt-based
[02:37:19.970 --> 02:37:24.290]  nutrients are going to destroy anything in our organic nutrients.
[02:37:24.290 --> 02:37:28.850]  But there is no problem using them together once you understand that balance.
[02:37:28.850 --> 02:37:33.170]  Now let's talk about some of the pros and cons of bottled nutrients.
[02:37:33.170 --> 02:37:37.730]  A moment ago, I said you can choose whatever brand you like as long as you are comfortable
[02:37:37.730 --> 02:37:39.250]  with their ethics.
[02:37:39.250 --> 02:37:41.130]  Now what do I mean by that?
[02:37:41.130 --> 02:37:46.050]  As a consumer, it is our responsibility to understand what the companies we support do
[02:37:46.050 --> 02:37:48.050]  with the money we give them.
[02:37:48.050 --> 02:37:51.770]  If you don't agree with the way a company operates, if you don't agree with things a
[02:37:51.770 --> 02:37:55.190]  company supports, you do not have to shop with that company.
[02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:57.330]  You vote with your dollars.
[02:37:57.330 --> 02:38:00.850]  Try to spend your money with a company who supports cannabis.
[02:38:00.850 --> 02:38:03.230]  Try to keep your money on our team.
[02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:07.450]  Try not to spend your money with a company who is unethical, with a company who is slowly
[02:38:07.450 --> 02:38:11.590]  destroying the world, with a company who is slowly poisoning mankind.
[02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:15.570]  So when it comes to selecting nutrients, do a little bit of research about the company.
[02:38:15.570 --> 02:38:17.690]  Do research about their parent company.
[02:38:17.690 --> 02:38:22.290]  See who owns that company and find out who's at the top of the food chain and see who you're
[02:38:22.290 --> 02:38:23.790]  giving your money to.
[02:38:23.790 --> 02:38:28.370]  I know I just added a whole new step to your selection process, but that is my responsibility
[02:38:28.370 --> 02:38:30.690]  is to make you guys think about stuff like that.
[02:38:30.690 --> 02:38:35.050]  So think about the ethics of the company you are spending your money with when you're selecting
[02:38:35.050 --> 02:38:36.050]  your nutrients.
[02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:40.570]  Now let's talk more about the pros and cons of bottled nutrients specifically.
[02:38:40.570 --> 02:38:45.350]  Before we even get started, I know that bottled nutrients are not for everybody, but I also
[02:38:45.350 --> 02:38:49.590]  know that amended soils and living soils are not for everybody.
[02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:53.490]  So if you are a living soil guy, if you're an organic guy, I get it.
[02:38:53.490 --> 02:38:56.930]  You're probably already pulling your hair out saying, Jeff, don't recommend bottles
[02:38:56.930 --> 02:38:57.930]  to new growers.
[02:38:57.930 --> 02:39:02.690]  But you've got to keep in mind, not everybody is able to run a no-till grow.
[02:39:02.690 --> 02:39:06.410]  Not everybody is able to set up a living soil system.
[02:39:06.410 --> 02:39:09.950]  And also some people may just want to do bottled nutrients.
[02:39:09.950 --> 02:39:13.690]  If you're a chemistry student or your mind thinks that way, maybe you want a measuring
[02:39:13.690 --> 02:39:17.950]  device and a bottle of liquid to measure and then mix and then balance the pH.
[02:39:17.950 --> 02:39:19.470]  Maybe that's fun for you.
[02:39:19.470 --> 02:39:23.470]  If you're more of a biology student, you're more into horticulture and more into the dirt,
[02:39:23.470 --> 02:39:25.730]  maybe you want to make the pre-amended soil.
[02:39:25.730 --> 02:39:29.010]  It's all about doing it your way and what makes you happy.
[02:39:29.010 --> 02:39:31.410]  So I'm going to start with bottled nutrients.
[02:39:31.410 --> 02:39:35.030]  The pros to bottled nutrients are they are available.
[02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:37.770]  You can go to a growth store and they are on the shelf.
[02:39:37.770 --> 02:39:40.450]  You can go to Amazon and they are right there.
[02:39:40.450 --> 02:39:45.790]  One of the major advantages to bottled nutrients is that they are available.
[02:39:45.790 --> 02:39:51.770]  Another advantage to bottled nutrients is an available nutrient feeding schedule.
[02:39:51.790 --> 02:39:56.530]  Most of the reputable nutrient companies have a website that includes a nutrient calculator
[02:39:56.530 --> 02:39:59.030]  or a nutrient feed schedule.
[02:39:59.030 --> 02:40:00.790]  These are really easy to work with.
[02:40:00.790 --> 02:40:04.750]  You type in how many weeks you're going to veg, you type in how many weeks you're going
[02:40:04.750 --> 02:40:09.950]  to flour, and that website makes a custom nutrient regimen to fit your schedule.
[02:40:09.950 --> 02:40:14.550]  So week one of veg, it will tell you week one, feed this nutrient at this rate.
[02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:20.710]  So it'll say week one, use your base nutrients at 25 mils, use cow mag at five mils, use
[02:40:20.710 --> 02:40:23.170]  whatever else at this many mils per gallon of water.
[02:40:23.170 --> 02:40:26.410]  So you know week one, it's all right here listed out for me.
[02:40:26.410 --> 02:40:28.050]  Week two, what do I need to feed on week two?
[02:40:28.050 --> 02:40:31.770]  Oh, it says 25 mils of this, 10 mils of this, and 10 mils of this.
[02:40:31.770 --> 02:40:35.250]  And it'll run you all the way through the growth cycle, all the way up to the time you
[02:40:35.250 --> 02:40:36.250]  flush.
[02:40:36.250 --> 02:40:39.650]  So if you select a brand, you buy their lineup, you go to their website, you've got basic
[02:40:39.650 --> 02:40:43.410]  instructions on how to mix that brand for optimal results for your plants.
[02:40:43.410 --> 02:40:44.850]  Now you will need to dial that in.
[02:40:44.850 --> 02:40:49.210]  Not all plants are the same, but they give you a pretty good guideline on how to get
[02:40:49.210 --> 02:40:50.210]  started.
[02:40:50.210 --> 02:40:53.950]  Now, those companies want you to buy more bottles more frequently, so you can always
[02:40:53.950 --> 02:41:00.010]  reduce the recommended dosage, maybe 50%, maybe use 75%, but there's no need to start
[02:41:00.010 --> 02:41:02.410]  off at the whole recommended dosage.
[02:41:02.410 --> 02:41:06.850]  If you need more, you can add more, but you can never take out once you've burnt the plants.
[02:41:06.850 --> 02:41:08.790]  Once they're burnt, they are burned.
[02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:09.790]  So that's my recommendation.
[02:41:09.790 --> 02:41:14.910]  Start at maybe 50 to 75% of the recommended dosage on those schedules, and then increase
[02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:15.910]  as needed.
[02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:19.430]  And as you get more experience with the plants, you will start to see if they need less or
[02:41:19.650 --> 02:41:20.790]  more nutrients.
[02:41:20.790 --> 02:41:22.130]  So that's a really handy thing.
[02:41:22.130 --> 02:41:25.830]  They have a nutrient calculator on the website.
[02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:30.670]  So learning to grow with bottles can be very easy because of the accessibility and these
[02:41:30.670 --> 02:41:31.670]  websites.
[02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:36.670]  Another great thing about bottle nutrients is easily repeatable results.
[02:41:36.670 --> 02:41:38.830]  We know exactly what is in each bottle.
[02:41:38.830 --> 02:41:41.370]  We know the ratios of each element in there.
[02:41:41.370 --> 02:41:47.470]  So if we wrote down how much we fed each nutrient, each feeding time, and we also documented
[02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:52.670]  the pH of those feedings, we should be able to have repeatable results using the same
[02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:54.070]  product every time.
[02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:57.150]  Now, you will need similar environmental factors in the room.
[02:41:57.150 --> 02:42:00.710]  You'll need the same temperature and the same humidity and the same VPD.
[02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:05.230]  But as long as nothing changed too drastically in your grow room, you'll be able to repeat
[02:42:05.230 --> 02:42:09.990]  your last feeding schedule and your crop should come out with similar quality to the last
[02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.990]  harvest.
[02:42:10.990 --> 02:42:15.170]  All right, those are some of the pros of working with bottled nutrients.
[02:42:15.170 --> 02:42:16.710]  They are readily available.
[02:42:16.710 --> 02:42:18.710]  There are nutrient schedules available.
[02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:21.710]  They're fairly easy to work with and they are reliable.
[02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:25.070]  We know exactly what is in each bottle.
[02:42:25.070 --> 02:42:29.950]  Now let's talk about some of the cons to bottled nutrients.
[02:42:29.950 --> 02:42:35.390]  Most of the cons to working with bottle nutrients are all related and they are mostly environmental
[02:42:35.390 --> 02:42:36.390]  factors.
[02:42:36.390 --> 02:42:41.930]  First, we have a bunch of plastic bottles that is environmentally unsustainable.
[02:42:41.930 --> 02:42:47.090]  Often we are shipping plastic bottles filled with water across the country.
[02:42:47.090 --> 02:42:51.210]  Most of the nutrients we are buying are 80 to 90% water.
[02:42:51.210 --> 02:42:56.170]  So we are basically paying a truck driver to drive his truck across the country to haul
[02:42:56.170 --> 02:42:58.750]  plastic bottles of water.
[02:42:58.750 --> 02:43:00.530]  That is completely unsustainable.
[02:43:00.530 --> 02:43:04.010]  Then once that bottle gets to us, we have it for a couple of weeks, then what do we
[02:43:04.010 --> 02:43:05.010]  do?
[02:43:05.010 --> 02:43:07.570]  We throw away or recycle that plastic bottle.
[02:43:07.570 --> 02:43:11.930]  The recycling center in my area will not take plastic bottles that had nutrients or
[02:43:11.930 --> 02:43:13.230]  pesticides in them.
[02:43:13.230 --> 02:43:16.050]  They cannot do it, so they have to be thrown away.
[02:43:16.050 --> 02:43:20.870]  So the downside is that we are shipping plastic bottles filled with water and then we are
[02:43:20.870 --> 02:43:23.090]  throwing plastic bottles in a landfill.
[02:43:23.090 --> 02:43:24.930]  It's very unsustainable.
[02:43:24.930 --> 02:43:30.290]  So most of the reasons to not use bottled nutrients are environmentally based and sustainability
[02:43:30.290 --> 02:43:31.610]  based.
[02:43:31.610 --> 02:43:36.770]  So most of the cons to working with bottled nutrients are environmental factors.
[02:43:36.770 --> 02:43:39.970]  Another thing to think about is, are you going to know how to grow when those bottles
[02:43:39.970 --> 02:43:41.210]  go away?
[02:43:41.210 --> 02:43:45.210]  If the grow store is to close and society falls apart and we have to go back to actually
[02:43:45.210 --> 02:43:49.690]  farming, are you going to understand how to farm your cannabis plants or are you going
[02:43:49.690 --> 02:43:52.490]  to be stuck reaching for bottles?
[02:43:52.490 --> 02:43:56.930]  That's where the organic and the no-till guys really laugh at the bottle growers.
[02:43:56.930 --> 02:44:01.730]  So those are the pros and cons of working with bottled nutrients.
[02:44:01.770 --> 02:44:06.410]  When you're shopping for bottled nutrients, don't be sold by cool packaging and fancy
[02:44:06.410 --> 02:44:07.410]  logos.
[02:44:07.410 --> 02:44:12.410]  Also, when it comes to selecting nutrients, if you're a new grower, I recommend you stick
[02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:14.270]  with one brand.
[02:44:14.270 --> 02:44:18.810]  Don't try to buy base nutrients from one company, CalMag from another company, a Bloom Booster
[02:44:18.810 --> 02:44:20.330]  from another company.
[02:44:20.330 --> 02:44:23.130]  This will lead to problems.
[02:44:23.130 --> 02:44:26.930]  Let me try to quickly explain why this could become problematic.
[02:44:26.930 --> 02:44:32.130]  Each company breaks down the required elements for your plants in different bottles, different
[02:44:32.130 --> 02:44:33.130]  packages.
[02:44:33.130 --> 02:44:37.850]  Now, some of these elements can be mixed together in a bottle and some cannot be mixed together
[02:44:37.850 --> 02:44:41.170]  in bottles, so they've got to make two different products.
[02:44:41.170 --> 02:44:45.650]  Some companies want you to buy 30 different bottles so that you can dial in that mix to
[02:44:45.650 --> 02:44:51.010]  have exactly as much nitrogen as you want, exactly as much phosphorus, exactly as much
[02:44:51.010 --> 02:44:55.890]  potassium, while other companies will mix the nitrogen in one bottle and the phosphorus
[02:44:55.890 --> 02:44:58.090]  and potassium in another bottle.
[02:44:58.090 --> 02:45:02.650]  They do that because it's easier than having 30 bottles for your nutrient line.
[02:45:02.650 --> 02:45:06.190]  So each company knows what is in each product they are putting out.
[02:45:06.190 --> 02:45:10.730]  They know that if they put out a base and a Bloom Booster and you use them together,
[02:45:10.730 --> 02:45:14.650]  they know they did not double up on any specific element in those two bottles.
[02:45:14.650 --> 02:45:20.090]  Now, if you grab a base nutrient from one brand and a Bloom Booster from another brand,
[02:45:20.090 --> 02:45:24.130]  they never spoke to each other, you may be doubling up and adding too much of one element
[02:45:24.130 --> 02:45:26.710]  to your plant and not even realize it.
[02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:29.730]  So that's why I recommend picking one brand and sticking with it.
[02:45:29.730 --> 02:45:31.090]  It has nothing to do with loyalty.
[02:45:31.090 --> 02:45:32.730]  It has nothing to do with marketing.
[02:45:32.730 --> 02:45:37.450]  It just has to do with making sure you do not double up and burn your plants.
[02:45:37.450 --> 02:45:41.730]  Now, I've got one more note about bottled nutrients I want to discuss before we move
[02:45:41.730 --> 02:45:42.970]  on.
[02:45:42.970 --> 02:45:43.970]  Keep this in mind.
[02:45:43.970 --> 02:45:47.330]  Our plants require 16 elements for healthy growth.
[02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:51.890]  Our plants require carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.
[02:45:51.890 --> 02:45:54.050]  Now those come from the air and the water.
[02:45:54.050 --> 02:45:56.850]  The nitrogen comes from the air and the soil.
[02:45:56.850 --> 02:46:06.530]  Also, our plants want phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, chlorine,
[02:46:06.530 --> 02:46:11.970]  copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc.
[02:46:11.970 --> 02:46:14.410]  Those are the necessary elements.
[02:46:14.410 --> 02:46:19.370]  As long as the nutrients you were buying have all of those required elements, you were covering
[02:46:19.370 --> 02:46:21.370]  most of your bases.
[02:46:21.370 --> 02:46:24.130]  Of course, I would recommend adding an enzymatic product.
[02:46:24.130 --> 02:46:25.890]  Some sort of enzymes are going to help.
[02:46:25.890 --> 02:46:27.410]  Some sort of carbs are going to help.
[02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:34.250]  And I always recommend some sort of root love, some sort of beneficial microbes, some mycos,
[02:46:34.250 --> 02:46:38.730]  beneficial fungus, beneficial bacteria for your rhizosphere.
[02:46:38.730 --> 02:46:43.930]  Now you may also need a PK booster, a bloom booster later in flower, but you don't need
[02:46:43.930 --> 02:46:47.410]  a whole bunch of unnecessary ingredients for your plant.
[02:46:47.410 --> 02:46:52.170]  As long as you're getting these 16 elements, maybe some enzymes, maybe some carbs, and
[02:46:52.170 --> 02:46:57.130]  I would always recommend some sort of a root inoculant, your plants will be happy.
[02:46:57.130 --> 02:47:01.050]  Don't let the guy at the grocery store sell you stuff because he works on commission.
[02:47:01.050 --> 02:47:04.850]  Don't let the bottles at the grocery store sell you stuff because they have really cool
[02:47:04.850 --> 02:47:07.210]  logos and they're well advertised.
[02:47:07.210 --> 02:47:11.850]  When you go to a farm supply store, everything comes in a white bag with black writing and
[02:47:11.850 --> 02:47:13.490]  it all works.
[02:47:13.490 --> 02:47:17.730]  All of that fancy labeling and packaging is just something to charge you extra for, so
[02:47:17.730 --> 02:47:19.570]  don't fall for it.
[02:47:19.570 --> 02:47:22.730]  Now the next part of my note says to discuss my experience.
[02:47:22.730 --> 02:47:26.530]  I try not to talk too much about specific brands in here, so I'm not going to go too
[02:47:26.530 --> 02:47:31.290]  far in detail and I may not even say specific brand names, but you may catch on.
[02:47:31.290 --> 02:47:35.490]  When I first started growing, I used a very popular brand of nutrients.
[02:47:35.490 --> 02:47:38.730]  They are that company that has about 40 bottles available.
[02:47:38.730 --> 02:47:40.650]  I bought all 40 bottles.
[02:47:40.650 --> 02:47:43.890]  I had a lot of fun mixing and dialing in that mix.
[02:47:43.890 --> 02:47:48.090]  I did that stuff for two or three years and I got really good at it.
[02:47:48.090 --> 02:47:52.650]  I was able to pull over two pounds from a normal thousand watt light in an indoor basement
[02:47:52.650 --> 02:47:56.450]  grow reliably using this company's nutrients.
[02:47:56.450 --> 02:48:02.450]  Unfortunately, everything I grew with that product tasted and smelled and looked exactly
[02:48:02.450 --> 02:48:03.650]  the same.
[02:48:03.650 --> 02:48:08.530]  If I grew OG Kush and Super Lemon Haze in the same room with this nutrient line, they
[02:48:08.530 --> 02:48:11.690]  would both smell and look fairly similar.
[02:48:11.690 --> 02:48:15.370]  There would be a lot of weed and it would be really potent, but you could barely tell
[02:48:15.370 --> 02:48:17.370]  that I grew two different strains.
[02:48:17.370 --> 02:48:18.850]  I didn't like that.
[02:48:18.850 --> 02:48:22.450]  So I switched to another company that was known to be their competitor.
[02:48:22.450 --> 02:48:26.730]  This company still had quite a few bottles, but not as many, but this company was not
[02:48:26.730 --> 02:48:31.450]  nearly as expensive as the brand I had tried before, so I started using their product.
[02:48:31.450 --> 02:48:35.250]  I could tell a few weeks in that I was not satisfied with that product either.
[02:48:35.250 --> 02:48:36.770]  My plants were looking colorful.
[02:48:36.770 --> 02:48:42.090]  I could tell a huge difference in each varietal, but there was not going to be the weight or
[02:48:42.090 --> 02:48:44.810]  potency that I'd gotten from the previous brand.
[02:48:44.810 --> 02:48:48.450]  So that's when I had to get rid of that product and move on to something else.
[02:48:48.450 --> 02:48:52.490]  I'd been doing a lot of research and I had fallen in love with Botanicare.
[02:48:52.490 --> 02:48:56.570]  Now I know I told you I wasn't going to talk about a lot of brands, but Botanicare did
[02:48:56.570 --> 02:48:59.770]  a really good job for me for a really long time.
[02:48:59.770 --> 02:49:04.890]  I dialed in a beautiful Botanicare recipe with a couple of additives and I grew some
[02:49:04.890 --> 02:49:11.050]  of the best cannabis I have ever smoked with Botanicare nutrients and a few other additives.
[02:49:11.050 --> 02:49:14.050]  I was ecstatic with my results from Botanicare.
[02:49:14.050 --> 02:49:16.570]  Then I noticed something started changing.
[02:49:16.570 --> 02:49:18.550]  They were changing their recipes.
[02:49:18.550 --> 02:49:22.410]  Then one day they announced that they had sold their company.
[02:49:22.410 --> 02:49:25.890]  Noticing that the recipe was changing and that my plants weren't as happy as they had
[02:49:25.890 --> 02:49:30.350]  been with that product before already had me looking into another product line.
[02:49:30.350 --> 02:49:34.790]  I was also working in commercial grows and experimenting with other product lines in
[02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:36.270]  those grows.
[02:49:36.270 --> 02:49:40.510]  Being exposed to commercial grows and the options to run so many different products
[02:49:40.510 --> 02:49:45.350]  on so many different levels, let me see what worked and what did not work for me and the
[02:49:45.350 --> 02:49:46.350]  way that I grow.
[02:49:46.350 --> 02:49:50.670]  So knowing that Botanicare was changing their recipes and then discovering that Botanicare
[02:49:50.670 --> 02:49:54.950]  had sold their brand to Hawthorne, who is one of those companies I spoke of earlier
[02:49:54.950 --> 02:49:58.550]  that we would rather not support, I had to make a change.
[02:49:58.550 --> 02:50:02.550]  I had been using a powdered nutrient system in a commercial grow for quite a while and
[02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:04.670]  I was ecstatic with the results.
[02:50:04.670 --> 02:50:10.350]  I had also been learning to use another bottled nutrient system in that grow and I was completely
[02:50:10.350 --> 02:50:13.790]  satisfied with their results as well.
[02:50:13.790 --> 02:50:18.030]  Over time I realized that the powdered nutrient company was lacking just a couple of things
[02:50:18.030 --> 02:50:21.890]  that I could probably boost up my production if I added a few things.
[02:50:21.890 --> 02:50:26.790]  So I took a couple of products from that bottled nutrient line and added those to my powdered
[02:50:27.230 --> 02:50:32.710]  nutrient line and by using two different nutrient companies, I have created a stellar nutrient
[02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:35.390]  program for my grow.
[02:50:35.390 --> 02:50:39.430]  Now earlier I did say that I would recommend you stick to one brand, but once you learn
[02:50:39.430 --> 02:50:43.230]  the plants and you learn about the nutrients, you'll be able to customize your mix to as
[02:50:43.230 --> 02:50:47.670]  many brands as you like, as long as you understand what's in each bottle.
[02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:51.590]  Now I've been trying to avoid giving you brand names and specific product names, but I already
[02:50:51.590 --> 02:50:54.510]  know I'm going to get a bunch of emails if I don't tell you what I use.
[02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:58.790]  I'm just going to spill the beans and tell you that I use Veg Bloom powdered nutrients
[02:50:58.790 --> 02:50:59.790]  as my base.
[02:50:59.790 --> 02:51:01.270]  I use Veg Bloom HD.
[02:51:01.270 --> 02:51:06.750]  I also use Plus Life and when we get into flower, I start adding two grams of Shine
[02:51:06.750 --> 02:51:09.790]  and then as we get later into flower, I will increase the Shine.
[02:51:09.790 --> 02:51:11.030]  That's very strain specific.
[02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:15.850]  I've gotten up to four grams of Shine per gallon on some strains and they love it.
[02:51:15.850 --> 02:51:20.230]  To the Veg Bloom mix, I also add a little bit of New Millennium products.
[02:51:20.230 --> 02:51:25.190]  I use the Ruby, the fulvic acid from New Millennium and I also use the Carbonaria,
[02:51:25.190 --> 02:51:27.230]  the carbs from New Millennium.
[02:51:27.230 --> 02:51:30.030]  So I'm adding a little fulvic acid to increase uptake.
[02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:33.070]  I'm adding a little bit of carbs to give more energy.
[02:51:33.070 --> 02:51:38.650]  Then I also add SLF 100 enzymes and if the plants show me that they need more CalMag,
[02:51:38.650 --> 02:51:44.190]  we use Cali Magic from GH in a commercial facility and that is basically my nutrient
[02:51:44.190 --> 02:51:46.710]  schedule for a large commercial grow.
[02:51:46.710 --> 02:51:50.190]  All right, that's my rant on bottled nutrients.
[02:51:50.190 --> 02:51:53.230]  Now let's talk more about amended soils.
[02:51:53.230 --> 02:51:54.590]  Let's talk about super soil.
[02:51:54.590 --> 02:51:59.830]  Let's talk about living soil and we'll kind of touch on no-till environments as well.
[02:51:59.830 --> 02:52:04.830]  I don't have as much experience in this realm, so I will not have as many details for you,
[02:52:04.830 --> 02:52:08.510]  but I'm sure that I'll be able to give you a good enough breakdown to help you make your
[02:52:08.510 --> 02:52:13.390]  decision in selecting your nutrient or your fertilizing style for your new garden.
[02:52:13.390 --> 02:52:19.070]  Now let's talk a little bit about what I mean by living soils and super soils.
[02:52:19.070 --> 02:52:22.270]  This is a more natural, more sustainable approach.
[02:52:22.270 --> 02:52:27.010]  Your super soil can be as simple or as elaborate as you want to make it.
[02:52:27.010 --> 02:52:31.750]  There are a lot of recipes for usable super soils online.
[02:52:31.750 --> 02:52:34.230]  Making your own living soil can be very easy.
[02:52:34.230 --> 02:52:39.530]  You are basically combining dried amendments with soil or soilless mix and giving it the
[02:52:39.530 --> 02:52:44.190]  proper conditions and time to cook and become alive.
[02:52:44.190 --> 02:52:47.590]  The way I would do it is through a large tarp on the garage floor.
[02:52:47.590 --> 02:52:49.830]  I would put out the amount of soil that I need.
[02:52:49.830 --> 02:52:52.390]  I would add all the dried amendments on top of that.
[02:52:52.390 --> 02:52:55.990]  I would use a shovel and or a pitchfork to stir that up real nice.
[02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:59.310]  Then once it's all mixed up, you add it to a trash can.
[02:52:59.310 --> 02:53:03.350]  You may need to add a little bit of moisture to your new concoction just to get the party
[02:53:03.350 --> 02:53:04.350]  started.
[02:53:04.350 --> 02:53:08.910]  Then you put the lid on the trash can and store it in a warm area and wait about 30
[02:53:08.910 --> 02:53:09.910]  days.
[02:53:09.910 --> 02:53:14.250]  Over time, all of those amendments will start breaking down in that soil and they will create
[02:53:14.250 --> 02:53:17.430]  a living environment in that trash can.
[02:53:17.430 --> 02:53:21.930]  When you take the lid off of that trash can, if you see a white layer of moldy funk on
[02:53:21.930 --> 02:53:25.550]  top of the dirt, that is exactly what we are looking for.
[02:53:25.550 --> 02:53:26.750]  That is life.
[02:53:26.750 --> 02:53:28.990]  You have created living soil.
[02:53:28.990 --> 02:53:33.390]  We have basically mimicked what mother nature does inside of a small container and we are
[02:53:33.390 --> 02:53:37.870]  giving the plants exactly what they would want without force feeding them anything that
[02:53:37.870 --> 02:53:39.430]  they do not want.
[02:53:39.430 --> 02:53:44.390]  Now depending on the mineral content of your newly made soil, you may need to add a little
[02:53:44.390 --> 02:53:48.870]  bit of uncharged soil to your pots when you're putting new plants in there because that
[02:53:48.870 --> 02:53:51.150]  fresh soil may be a little too potent.
[02:53:51.150 --> 02:53:55.270]  It may be a little too rich and you may need to cut it down to reduce burning your new
[02:53:55.270 --> 02:53:56.550]  baby plants.
[02:53:56.550 --> 02:54:00.470]  So that's something to think about when working with the living soil.
[02:54:00.470 --> 02:54:05.350]  Now let's talk a little bit about the pros and cons of a living soil environment.
[02:54:05.350 --> 02:54:09.070]  The main, the best part is that it is organic.
[02:54:09.070 --> 02:54:13.950]  As long as everything you put in there is organic, you have got an organic grow.
[02:54:13.950 --> 02:54:16.950]  It is also very sustainable.
[02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:18.990]  Most of those dried amendments come in a box.
[02:54:18.990 --> 02:54:22.250]  That box is either compostable or recyclable.
[02:54:22.250 --> 02:54:25.190]  Also there's not a bunch of water in that box to ship around.
[02:54:25.190 --> 02:54:30.110]  So you are getting the product, the product goes into the soil, the box goes into recycling.
[02:54:30.110 --> 02:54:32.510]  There's very minimal waste.
[02:54:32.510 --> 02:54:36.730]  Some of those meals are actually waste products that we are reusing.
[02:54:36.730 --> 02:54:41.270]  So we are actually recycling and putting a waste product to use by putting it in our
[02:54:41.270 --> 02:54:42.350]  garden.
[02:54:42.350 --> 02:54:46.190]  So that's a huge advantage of living soil situations.
[02:54:46.190 --> 02:54:50.350]  Also when you start running a living soil or an organic garden, you will also probably
[02:54:50.350 --> 02:54:55.750]  end up creating a compost bin in your home, which will also create more environmental
[02:54:55.750 --> 02:54:58.670]  awareness, which will just cause a chain reaction.
[02:54:58.670 --> 02:55:02.450]  Once you start growing organically, you'll start seeing things on a more organic level
[02:55:02.450 --> 02:55:03.450]  in your whole life.
[02:55:03.450 --> 02:55:06.830]  It will affect your eating, it will affect your shopping, you'll start thinking about
[02:55:06.830 --> 02:55:09.370]  the earth differently as a whole.
[02:55:09.370 --> 02:55:13.210]  So that's one of the benefits and also some of the side effects of growing in a living
[02:55:13.210 --> 02:55:14.930]  soil environment.
[02:55:14.930 --> 02:55:20.090]  If you start working in a no-till environment, another huge advantage is very minimal waste.
[02:55:20.090 --> 02:55:23.330]  When it comes to no-till, there is essentially no waste.
[02:55:23.330 --> 02:55:27.610]  In a no-till environment, you harvest a plant, you hang the plant.
[02:55:27.610 --> 02:55:31.250]  That gets trimmed and dried and cured and consumed.
[02:55:31.250 --> 02:55:34.210]  The waste goes back into your compost pile.
[02:55:34.210 --> 02:55:37.610]  That pot where we just cut that plant out of, we're going to gently cut the root ball
[02:55:37.610 --> 02:55:38.930]  out of there.
[02:55:38.930 --> 02:55:41.010]  Cut that big root ball, just take that out.
[02:55:41.010 --> 02:55:44.730]  Then we're going to put another clone in that spot and we're going to backfill that with
[02:55:44.730 --> 02:55:47.810]  composted dirt that we've got in our compost pile.
[02:55:47.810 --> 02:55:52.590]  And now we've got a fresh plant ready to go with zero waste.
[02:55:52.590 --> 02:55:56.050]  So that is a huge advantage to a no-till garden.
[02:55:56.050 --> 02:56:00.730]  People growing cocoa or growing soil, they've got to figure out how to either recycle or
[02:56:00.730 --> 02:56:03.130]  get rid of all of that cocoa or soil.
[02:56:03.530 --> 02:56:09.410]  If you've got more than four or five, three gallon pots worth of used cocoa or soil, it
[02:56:09.410 --> 02:56:11.210]  becomes a challenge to try to get rid of that.
[02:56:11.210 --> 02:56:13.210]  You can't just dump it in the backyard.
[02:56:13.210 --> 02:56:16.610]  Someone's going to notice that big fresh pile of dirt with a bunch of perlite in there and
[02:56:16.610 --> 02:56:18.530]  then they're going to say, perlite, what's he doing?
[02:56:18.530 --> 02:56:20.450]  And it's going to just start triggering things.
[02:56:20.450 --> 02:56:24.010]  So that's hugely advantageous to not have any waste.
[02:56:24.010 --> 02:56:30.010]  When it comes to no-till gardening, another huge advantage is there are minimal bug threats.
[02:56:30.010 --> 02:56:34.570]  It seems like when you establish a no-till garden, it comes right along with beneficial
[02:56:34.570 --> 02:56:35.570]  insects.
[02:56:35.570 --> 02:56:40.330]  And if you do introduce any spider mites or unwanted pests, those beneficial insects are
[02:56:40.330 --> 02:56:45.690]  already there and they'll creep in and destroy the population before it gets out of control.
[02:56:45.690 --> 02:56:48.730]  So that's always a good thing with a no-till garden.
[02:56:48.730 --> 02:56:52.770]  Our friend Frosty was on the show a while back and he was talking about going hiking
[02:56:52.770 --> 02:56:54.890]  and then walking right into his no-till grow.
[02:56:54.890 --> 02:56:58.930]  And I said, bro, don't you kind of worry about maybe gathering a spider mite on your shoe
[02:56:58.930 --> 02:57:00.410]  and taking spider mites into that grow?
[02:57:00.410 --> 02:57:04.650]  And he said, bro, that's just food for the predator mites that are already in there.
[02:57:04.650 --> 02:57:09.490]  So the no-till guys seem to be fairly confident in their pest management system.
[02:57:09.490 --> 02:57:14.970]  So some of the major advantages to a living soil or an organic system are it is clean
[02:57:14.970 --> 02:57:15.970]  and organic.
[02:57:15.970 --> 02:57:19.550]  As long as everything you put in there is organic, you know that everything comes out
[02:57:19.550 --> 02:57:21.530]  of there is organic.
[02:57:21.530 --> 02:57:24.110]  That means a lot to a lot of people.
[02:57:24.110 --> 02:57:25.710]  Also it is sustainable.
[02:57:25.710 --> 02:57:31.230]  If the grow shop burns down, if Amazon shuts down, if you learn how to grow like a farmer,
[02:57:31.230 --> 02:57:34.470]  when the shit hits the fan, you'll be one of the few people out there growing your own
[02:57:34.470 --> 02:57:37.370]  food and growing herb for us to smoke.
[02:57:37.370 --> 02:57:39.810]  And that goes right along with what I call a side effect.
[02:57:39.810 --> 02:57:43.630]  You start becoming more aware of what you're doing to the environment.
[02:57:43.630 --> 02:57:47.270]  When you go grocery shopping, you'll find yourself in the produce section trying to
[02:57:47.270 --> 02:57:52.130]  buy more things that have something you can add to your compost bin after you eat.
[02:57:52.130 --> 02:57:56.830]  So it will totally affect the way you shop, the way you eat, and the way you live.
[02:57:56.830 --> 02:58:01.790]  And when you head into the no-till range, another huge advantage is minimal waste and
[02:58:01.790 --> 02:58:04.510]  very minimal pests.
[02:58:04.510 --> 02:58:08.790]  Now once we've got our living soil established and we've got our garden going, if we do notice
[02:58:08.790 --> 02:58:14.250]  some sort of a deficiency, there are ways that we can add nutrients to our organic system
[02:58:14.250 --> 02:58:16.350]  without introducing bottled nutrients.
[02:58:16.350 --> 02:58:19.810]  It is very easy to brew up a compost tea.
[02:58:19.810 --> 02:58:23.550]  Sean and Jesse have talked about compost teas a lot on this show.
[02:58:23.550 --> 02:58:25.790]  I'm not going to go too deep into making a tea.
[02:58:25.790 --> 02:58:30.230]  You basically throw amendments in a bucket and add an aerator and you let it bubble for
[02:58:30.230 --> 02:58:32.030]  a certain amount of time.
[02:58:32.030 --> 02:58:35.790]  Then depending on the strength of the tea and the type of tea we made, we either dilute
[02:58:35.790 --> 02:58:39.270]  it or we water it directly into the plants.
[02:58:39.270 --> 02:58:45.030]  As long as everything you used to make your tea was organic, your grow is still fully
[02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:46.490]  organic.
[02:58:46.510 --> 02:58:51.670]  Another option for adding nutrients to a slowing organic garden is to top dress.
[02:58:51.670 --> 02:58:56.190]  You can place organic amendments on top of the soil and water them in just like you would
[02:58:56.190 --> 02:58:57.910]  a bottled nutrient.
[02:58:57.910 --> 02:59:02.030]  This may not work as rapidly as it would when using bottled nutrients because you will need
[02:59:02.030 --> 02:59:05.510]  time for the organic amendments to break down.
[02:59:05.510 --> 02:59:11.350]  But top dressing is certainly a way to add nutrients to an organic living soil without
[02:59:11.350 --> 02:59:13.630]  introducing bottled nutrients.
[02:59:13.650 --> 02:59:17.610]  So if you've set up a living soil or a super soil and you see those plants are slowing
[02:59:17.610 --> 02:59:22.070]  down or if you see those plants are showing you some type of deficiency, you should be
[02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:26.870]  able to brew up a compost tea or top dress with the appropriate amendment to add the
[02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:29.770]  missing element that those plants will need.
[02:59:29.770 --> 02:59:34.610]  Things I have heard Jesse and Sean talk about top dressing quite often are fish meal, kelp
[02:59:34.610 --> 02:59:37.890]  meal, alfalfa, and comfrey.
[02:59:37.890 --> 02:59:42.330]  So now before I get myself too far off track, let's talk about some of the cons of working
[02:59:42.430 --> 02:59:45.950]  with a living soil or a super soil type environment.
[02:59:45.950 --> 02:59:48.190]  The downside is the mix work.
[02:59:48.190 --> 02:59:51.910]  If you don't have a space to mix this, if you don't have a space to cook the soil, it
[02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:53.110]  might not be an option.
[02:59:53.110 --> 02:59:56.070]  It does take a lot of space to create this soil.
[02:59:56.070 --> 03:00:00.230]  Then it does take a trash can worth of space to store this soil.
[03:00:00.230 --> 03:00:03.790]  Now that leads me right into the next part, which is the cook time.
[03:00:03.790 --> 03:00:07.870]  Maybe you decided you want to start a garden and you're going to start it next week.
[03:00:07.870 --> 03:00:11.630]  You need at least 30 days to brew up a batch of super soil.
[03:00:11.650 --> 03:00:13.410]  You are already running late.
[03:00:13.410 --> 03:00:15.690]  So the downside is the cook time.
[03:00:15.690 --> 03:00:16.890]  You've got to mix it.
[03:00:16.890 --> 03:00:19.930]  You've got to let it cook and come alive.
[03:00:19.930 --> 03:00:24.890]  Now another disadvantage to working with a super soil or a living soil is understanding
[03:00:24.890 --> 03:00:27.530]  the richness of the soil you just made.
[03:00:27.530 --> 03:00:29.530]  Is that soil too hot for little plants?
[03:00:29.530 --> 03:00:31.490]  Will it be okay for little plants?
[03:00:31.490 --> 03:00:35.570]  A new grower may not have the eye to see if those plants are having problems and they
[03:00:35.570 --> 03:00:39.890]  won't know how to identify it and they won't know how to prevent or correct an issue if
[03:00:39.910 --> 03:00:41.790]  they see it in a living soil.
[03:00:41.790 --> 03:00:44.590]  So that could be problematic.
[03:00:44.590 --> 03:00:49.590]  Another disadvantage to working with the living soil is if you do have a pest issue, you are
[03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:53.910]  very limited on approaches for eradicating your pests.
[03:00:53.910 --> 03:00:56.670]  You've got to stick to organic options.
[03:00:56.670 --> 03:01:01.230]  If you've got a soil pest problem, your options are very limited.
[03:01:01.230 --> 03:01:05.790]  Like we said earlier, you shouldn't encounter too many problems in an organic soil environment
[03:01:05.790 --> 03:01:09.630]  because we've got enough microorganisms there to keep that in check.
[03:01:09.970 --> 03:01:14.530]  If you do end up with a root problem, you are very limited on ways you can treat.
[03:01:14.530 --> 03:01:17.930]  You cannot treat your living soil with a root drench.
[03:01:17.930 --> 03:01:21.810]  If you were running a soil garden and you were feeding with bottled nutrients and you
[03:01:21.810 --> 03:01:27.490]  ran into a root problem like a root pest, you would be able to do a root drench with
[03:01:27.490 --> 03:01:31.610]  a pesticide, either Botanigard Max or Evergreen.
[03:01:31.610 --> 03:01:35.930]  You just mix up 15 to 30 mils per gallon and you water that right in with your feeding
[03:01:36.030 --> 03:01:40.310]  solution and that will eradicate any soil-borne pests.
[03:01:40.310 --> 03:01:46.790]  If we go feeding Botanigard Max or Evergreen to a living soil situation, we basically destroy
[03:01:46.790 --> 03:01:49.950]  the entire environment we worked to create in there.
[03:01:49.950 --> 03:01:53.430]  So that is something to keep in mind when you were thinking about your nutrient and
[03:01:53.430 --> 03:01:54.690]  feeding regimen.
[03:01:54.690 --> 03:02:00.310]  Are you going to be able to implement your integrated pest management system with your
[03:02:00.310 --> 03:02:02.550]  nutrient and soil selections?
[03:02:02.550 --> 03:02:04.930]  It's all got to work together.
[03:02:04.930 --> 03:02:11.290]  So those are basically the pros and cons of working with a living organic soil.
[03:02:11.290 --> 03:02:16.090]  Basically you've got an organic, sustainable garden that should feel good to grow.
[03:02:16.090 --> 03:02:20.250]  The only real disadvantage that I can think of when it comes to growing in a living soil
[03:02:20.250 --> 03:02:24.050]  or an organic type environment is that it takes a lot of work ahead.
[03:02:24.050 --> 03:02:27.150]  There's a lot of work that has to happen before you start growing.
[03:02:27.150 --> 03:02:30.730]  But that work ahead may be exactly what some people want.
[03:02:30.730 --> 03:02:32.690]  That may be your style.
[03:02:32.690 --> 03:02:35.450]  Maybe you're one of the people that enjoy the smell of that rich dirt.
[03:02:35.450 --> 03:02:38.810]  Maybe you're the guy that enjoys mixing all those amendments together.
[03:02:38.810 --> 03:02:41.970]  Maybe you like having worm castings under your fingernails.
[03:02:41.970 --> 03:02:45.730]  Maybe you're into brewing your own compost teas or waiting for your own fermented plant
[03:02:45.730 --> 03:02:47.250]  juices to ferment.
[03:02:47.250 --> 03:02:50.810]  It's all about what makes you happy with your growth style.
[03:02:50.810 --> 03:02:55.210]  Also it's all about your abilities and what is available to you.
[03:02:55.210 --> 03:02:59.170]  If you live in a big city, maybe some of those organic amendments won't be as available to
[03:02:59.170 --> 03:03:00.170]  you.
[03:03:00.170 --> 03:03:04.130]  If you live in a small city, a small farm area, you'll have access to all of those organic
[03:03:04.130 --> 03:03:08.570]  inputs, but you may not have access to bottles and a hydro store.
[03:03:08.570 --> 03:03:11.090]  So it may come down to what's available in your area.
[03:03:11.090 --> 03:03:15.730]  Yes, most of us do have access to Amazon, but not everybody can afford everything on
[03:03:15.730 --> 03:03:16.730]  Amazon.
[03:03:16.730 --> 03:03:19.690]  So you may have to adjust to your budget as well.
[03:03:19.690 --> 03:03:23.570]  The main point of your garden is to produce a product that makes you happy.
[03:03:23.570 --> 03:03:27.230]  So as long as you are happy with your garden, as long as you're having fun, as long as you're
[03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:30.710]  enjoying yourself, and as long as you are getting a product at the end that makes you
[03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:32.750]  happy, you are doing it right.
[03:03:32.750 --> 03:03:34.990]  So set up a grow that you love.
[03:03:34.990 --> 03:03:35.990]  Are you the scientist?
[03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:40.190]  Do you want to be in there with a couple of measuring devices and bottles and measuring
[03:03:40.190 --> 03:03:42.390]  out 15 mils of this and pour it in?
[03:03:42.390 --> 03:03:46.030]  And then let's measure out 35 mils of this and pour it in and mix it.
[03:03:46.030 --> 03:03:48.510]  Now let's test the PPMs, see what that is.
[03:03:48.510 --> 03:03:49.510]  Ooh, that looks real good.
[03:03:49.510 --> 03:03:50.910]  Now let's adjust the pH.
[03:03:50.910 --> 03:03:52.190]  Now let's water the plants.
[03:03:52.190 --> 03:03:56.350]  Are you that guy or are you the guy that wants to mix up everything at the beginning and
[03:03:56.350 --> 03:03:59.470]  then just add water and then just watch the plants grow?
[03:03:59.470 --> 03:04:01.750]  Maybe you're the guy that wants to brew up a bunch of teas.
[03:04:01.750 --> 03:04:04.610]  Maybe you're that guy making the fermented plant juices.
[03:04:04.610 --> 03:04:05.610]  It's all up to you.
[03:04:05.610 --> 03:04:09.350]  You can be the scientist, you can be the farmer, you can be somewhere in between.
[03:04:09.350 --> 03:04:13.070]  As long as you are happy with your garden, that's really what matters.
[03:04:13.070 --> 03:04:15.470]  Now there are many more ways to feed your plants.
[03:04:15.470 --> 03:04:19.510]  I'm sure there are many more nutrient styles and fertilizing systems.
[03:04:19.510 --> 03:04:21.990]  One thing I should mention is aquaponics.
[03:04:21.990 --> 03:04:23.830]  I am not experienced in aquaponics.
[03:04:23.830 --> 03:04:27.630]  I can't teach you about aquaponics, but I feel like we would be leaving out all of our
[03:04:27.630 --> 03:04:32.710]  friends at the Growing With Fishes podcast if I didn't at least mention aquaponics as
[03:04:32.710 --> 03:04:37.350]  a very viable and sustainable way of fertilizing your cannabis garden.
[03:04:37.350 --> 03:04:39.790]  So big shout out to my friends at Growing With Fishes.
[03:04:39.790 --> 03:04:44.150]  I find it fascinating, but I do not have any experience, so I can't teach you anything
[03:04:44.150 --> 03:04:45.270]  about it.
[03:04:45.270 --> 03:04:52.390]  So that is my podcast about selecting nutrients and fertilizers for your new cannabis grow.
[03:04:52.430 --> 03:04:56.310]  Remember the most important part is that you are having fun and that you are happy with
[03:04:56.310 --> 03:04:58.150]  what comes out of your garden.
[03:04:58.150 --> 03:05:01.910]  Also try to keep in mind the ethics of whoever you are giving your money to.
[03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:06.230]  Try to shop with people who support our community and our industry.
[03:05:06.230 --> 03:05:10.270]  If I left anything out or if you've got anything you'd like to add, I would love to hear your
[03:05:10.270 --> 03:05:11.270]  feedback.
[03:05:11.270 --> 03:05:15.390]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
