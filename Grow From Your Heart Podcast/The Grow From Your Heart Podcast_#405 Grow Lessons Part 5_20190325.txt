[00:03.840 --> 00:31.220]  Welcome back, podcast world!
[00:31.220 --> 00:35.680]  It's time for episode 405 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:35.680 --> 00:38.620]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:38.620 --> 00:43.040]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can find
[00:43.040 --> 00:48.400]  them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:48.400 --> 00:52.480]  It's become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:52.480 --> 00:56.640]  Today I'm taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[00:56.640 --> 01:03.440]  The label says this is 66.3% THC with 77.8% total cannabinoids.
[01:03.440 --> 01:06.680]  If you listen to the show a lot, you know I am a big fan of the Stardog.
[01:06.680 --> 01:11.720]  I'm also a big fan of the Ambrosia, so this is a wonderful concentrate.
[01:11.720 --> 01:14.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you've been following along, you know that I have been reposting
[01:14.920 --> 01:17.320]  compilations of Grow Lessons.
[01:17.320 --> 01:22.080]  This will be the final compilation of reposted Grow Lessons in this episode.
[01:22.080 --> 01:29.920]  We're going to revisit episodes 389, 391, 393, 394, and 395.
[01:29.920 --> 01:34.240]  I want to thank everybody again for listening to these compiled Grow Lessons.
[01:34.240 --> 01:42.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's jump right in to these old Grow Lessons.
[01:42.090 --> 01:43.450]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[01:43.450 --> 01:47.530]  It is time for episode 389 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:47.530 --> 01:51.490]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of Grow Lessons.
[01:51.490 --> 01:55.850]  Also, you may know that I've been out of town and I've been reposting old episodes that
[01:55.850 --> 01:58.970]  fall right in line with those Grow Lessons.
[01:58.970 --> 02:02.930]  This episode is going to be a repost, but it is a good lesson on harvesting our ripe
[02:02.930 --> 02:04.370]  cannabis plants.
[02:04.370 --> 02:08.570]  I cut out a long intro and I cut out all of the advertising, so let's jump right in to
[02:08.570 --> 02:11.610]  a lesson on harvesting our ripe cannabis plants.
[02:11.610 --> 02:16.330]  All right, guys, let's do a podcast all about harvesting your cannabis.
[02:16.330 --> 02:20.690]  We've done an episode about determining when your plants are ripe.
[02:20.690 --> 02:23.730]  We've done an episode about flushing your plants before harvest.
[02:23.730 --> 02:27.290]  Now it is harvest time in the garden.
[02:27.290 --> 02:31.630]  There are a couple of things we need to think about before we go in and cut down the plants.
[02:31.630 --> 02:35.850]  First of all, I should mention, if this is your first time cutting down cannabis plants,
[02:35.850 --> 02:39.050]  you thought they smelled strongly when they were growing.
[02:39.050 --> 02:42.330]  As soon as you cut those fuckers down, it's going to double in smell.
[02:42.330 --> 02:44.450]  I know that sounds like I may be making it up.
[02:44.450 --> 02:45.890]  It sounds like I'm joking.
[02:45.890 --> 02:48.470]  No, it is going to stink.
[02:48.470 --> 02:50.810]  It's going to be ridiculous.
[02:50.810 --> 02:56.490]  If I grow one plant in a small house, we'll say in the attic or the basement, and then
[02:56.490 --> 03:00.810]  I chop that plant down and hang it up in that attic or basement.
[03:00.810 --> 03:04.970]  The stink of that plant, so normally you can smell it to the living room, right?
[03:04.970 --> 03:06.530]  To the living room of the house.
[03:06.530 --> 03:09.970]  As soon as you harvest, you can smell that shit to the driveway.
[03:09.970 --> 03:11.410]  I don't know the science behind that.
[03:11.410 --> 03:13.250]  I don't know if it's paranoia.
[03:13.250 --> 03:15.810]  I don't know if it's because we're moving in and out of the grow room more.
[03:15.810 --> 03:20.210]  I don't know exactly what it is, but as soon as you cut down that crop, it's going to stink
[03:20.210 --> 03:21.610]  more than you were expecting.
[03:21.610 --> 03:23.330]  Try to be prepared for that.
[03:23.330 --> 03:27.770]  Some things you can do to be prepared are maybe getting some Ona gels.
[03:27.770 --> 03:33.450]  If you know what Ona gels are, Ona gels are jars filled with this gelatinous substance
[03:33.450 --> 03:34.690]  that just eats up odor.
[03:34.690 --> 03:38.890]  It doesn't put out an odor, but it eats up the odors in the room.
[03:38.890 --> 03:39.890]  You open the jar.
[03:39.890 --> 03:43.490]  I used to just set a jar of it behind a house plant or behind a picture.
[03:43.490 --> 03:46.210]  You got a picture of your daughter up on the coffee table or up on the end table.
[03:46.210 --> 03:50.010]  You just stick one of these Ona jars opened right behind it, and that just starts sucking
[03:50.010 --> 03:51.890]  up all the odor out of the room.
[03:51.890 --> 03:55.730]  Put those by the doors and the entryways of your house where people may come in, and
[03:55.730 --> 03:57.770]  that way you're sucking up that odor.
[03:57.770 --> 04:04.250]  And then also, if you can't do the Ona gels, maybe do something stronger to cover the smell.
[04:04.250 --> 04:05.250]  It's going to be hard.
[04:05.250 --> 04:09.130]  If you're spraying lilac air freshener, you're going to smell lilac and weed.
[04:09.130 --> 04:12.930]  The Ona gels are going to be your best bet, something to neutralize the odor would be
[04:12.930 --> 04:14.810]  your best bet.
[04:14.810 --> 04:18.570]  Another good idea, if you can afford it, would be a carbon scrubber.
[04:18.570 --> 04:22.550]  Most of us have a carbon filter that blows air out of the grow room.
[04:22.550 --> 04:25.850]  Keep that running because that's going to keep filtering the air and make it smell good,
[04:25.850 --> 04:31.850]  but also get a carbon filter with a blower on top of it and just plug it in and let that
[04:31.850 --> 04:33.410]  air run through the carbon filter.
[04:33.410 --> 04:37.130]  And now you're just sucking stink out of the air, cleaning up that environment.
[04:37.130 --> 04:38.130]  So be prepared.
[04:38.130 --> 04:39.130]  It's going to stink.
[04:39.130 --> 04:40.410]  That is something we need to start with.
[04:40.410 --> 04:42.570]  It will be stinky.
[04:42.570 --> 04:46.570]  Now before we even start chopping down, there's a few more things to talk about.
[04:46.570 --> 04:49.730]  Where are all of these plants going to go once you cut them down?
[04:49.730 --> 04:52.890]  Let's plan this before we even get to harvest time.
[04:52.890 --> 04:56.850]  Are you going to use those circular racks that they sell at the grow store, the multi-tiered
[04:56.850 --> 04:58.130]  circle racks?
[04:58.130 --> 05:01.290]  Are you going to be able to make a line somewhere with string and hang them?
[05:01.290 --> 05:02.790]  That's what I prefer.
[05:02.790 --> 05:07.010]  Do you have a space that you're going to be able to control the temperature and the humidity
[05:07.010 --> 05:11.490]  and hopefully keep the aroma under control and hopefully keep light out and also keep
[05:11.490 --> 05:13.070]  people away?
[05:13.070 --> 05:17.110]  Start thinking about that around week six or seven, guys.
[05:17.110 --> 05:21.190]  Let's not wait until week nine to start figuring out where these plants are going.
[05:21.190 --> 05:22.190]  Start thinking about that early.
[05:22.190 --> 05:26.270]  So you need a place for them to hang that you can control the temperature, a place you
[05:26.270 --> 05:30.790]  can control the humidity and a place you can keep people out of there.
[05:30.790 --> 05:33.390]  And also you're going to have to control that aroma.
[05:33.390 --> 05:35.630]  So have a place prepared.
[05:35.630 --> 05:39.810]  And keep in mind that if you're going to dry your buds, if these buds hang in your dingy
[05:39.810 --> 05:44.610]  funky basement, they're going to taste like funky dingy basement.
[05:44.610 --> 05:48.010]  You've tasted that smell on buds before and you probably didn't realize why does this
[05:48.010 --> 05:49.650]  taste like the damn basement?
[05:49.650 --> 05:50.650]  You know why?
[05:50.650 --> 05:55.530]  Because it was dried and cured and hung for seven days in somebody's funky, damp, dirty
[05:55.530 --> 05:56.610]  fucking basement.
[05:56.610 --> 05:57.610]  That's exactly why.
[05:57.610 --> 06:02.890]  So have some air exchange, have some temperature control and have a good environment, you guys.
[06:02.890 --> 06:04.450]  Create a good environment for your plants.
[06:04.450 --> 06:06.070]  You've gotten them this far.
[06:06.070 --> 06:07.590]  Let's not ruin them.
[06:07.590 --> 06:12.370]  If you're growing in a grow hut and you don't have another crop coming up right behind it,
[06:12.370 --> 06:15.030]  why not just use that grow hut as your drying space?
[06:15.030 --> 06:16.790]  That would not be a bad idea.
[06:16.790 --> 06:18.850]  You're controlling that environment already anyway.
[06:18.850 --> 06:21.190]  So that is always an option.
[06:21.190 --> 06:22.470]  Create a good environment, you guys.
[06:22.470 --> 06:24.590]  And we'll talk more about the space in a minute.
[06:24.590 --> 06:26.310]  You can just use the grow room if you need to.
[06:26.310 --> 06:29.730]  If you don't have another crop coming up, just use your flower room or move the plants
[06:29.730 --> 06:31.530]  into flower, use the bedroom.
[06:31.530 --> 06:33.070]  That's always an option, but we'll get back to that.
[06:33.070 --> 06:34.190]  Don't worry, you guys.
[06:34.190 --> 06:38.950]  Let's talk more about the things we need to prepare for before harvest time comes.
[06:38.950 --> 06:41.070]  You're going to need a few tools.
[06:41.070 --> 06:43.870]  I highly recommend gloves.
[06:43.870 --> 06:46.590]  The black or the blue thin nitrile gloves.
[06:46.590 --> 06:47.590]  They don't have to be super thick.
[06:47.590 --> 06:49.510]  You're just trying to not get sticky.
[06:49.510 --> 06:53.550]  You guys, when you're trimming weed and when you're harvesting and handling this amount
[06:53.550 --> 06:55.430]  of weed, you're going to get sticky.
[06:55.430 --> 06:56.950]  You might want to wear long sleeves.
[06:56.950 --> 06:59.870]  You might want to wear just a long sleeve over shirt that you could take off when you're
[06:59.870 --> 07:00.870]  done.
[07:00.870 --> 07:01.950]  You're going to get sticky.
[07:01.950 --> 07:03.670]  You are going to stink.
[07:03.670 --> 07:06.790]  Some people have an allergy to cannabis.
[07:06.790 --> 07:10.030]  I've got a friend, if she rubs up against a blue dream plant, she's going to break out
[07:10.030 --> 07:11.910]  into a giant rash.
[07:11.910 --> 07:13.070]  Maybe cover yourself up.
[07:13.070 --> 07:14.790]  Certainly wear gloves.
[07:14.790 --> 07:22.430]  Also, if your eye itches, do never rub your eye with a trichome-laden finger.
[07:22.430 --> 07:26.030]  If your eye itches and you're trimming weed, take off your gloves and then itch your eye
[07:26.030 --> 07:28.390]  with a clean hand.
[07:28.390 --> 07:31.670]  If you've been trimming and not wearing gloves, go wash your hands before you itch your eye
[07:31.670 --> 07:37.030]  or scratch your eye because if you get resin in your eye, it is one of the most painful
[07:37.030 --> 07:39.950]  experiences you will ever endure.
[07:39.950 --> 07:41.510]  It hurts and it won't stop.
[07:41.510 --> 07:43.310]  I don't know what makes it stop.
[07:43.310 --> 07:47.190]  It just burns and burns and burns and it's sticky and when you blink, you expect it to
[07:47.190 --> 07:49.790]  feel better, but it's just stickier.
[07:49.790 --> 07:51.750]  It's so fucking miserable.
[07:51.750 --> 07:55.490]  Gloves, a long sleeve shirt.
[07:55.490 --> 07:57.590]  You're also going to need some scissors.
[07:57.590 --> 08:00.110]  I recommend quality scissors.
[08:00.110 --> 08:02.830]  You can buy some cheap, shitty scissors, but they're going to break.
[08:02.830 --> 08:06.830]  I also recommend using a different pair of scissors for cutting down the plants than
[08:06.830 --> 08:08.850]  you use for trimming the plants.
[08:08.850 --> 08:11.470]  When you're trimming, you're getting in there and getting the fine details.
[08:11.470 --> 08:15.070]  When you're cutting them down, you're using brute force and cutting down tough plants.
[08:15.070 --> 08:18.410]  You may need some thicker pruners.
[08:18.410 --> 08:20.990]  You may need some choppers to cut down a big plant.
[08:20.990 --> 08:24.230]  I don't know how big your stock is, but you want to be able to get in there and cut it
[08:24.230 --> 08:27.990]  down easily without hurting your wrist, without breaking your scissors.
[08:27.990 --> 08:33.230]  I like something that has got a metal solid piece to it for cutting them down.
[08:33.230 --> 08:35.630]  Not the plastic scissors for cutting them down, metal.
[08:35.630 --> 08:38.550]  Two solid pieces of metal from the handle to the blade.
[08:38.550 --> 08:43.550]  Then also for trimming, that's when I like the little fiskers, the diamond tips or something
[08:43.550 --> 08:45.190]  similar to that.
[08:45.190 --> 08:47.070]  Something to cut down the plants with.
[08:47.070 --> 08:50.950]  Scissors, shears, whatever you're going to use, be prepared.
[08:50.950 --> 08:55.670]  If you're going to have more than one person doing the chopping down, get more than one
[08:55.670 --> 08:57.150]  fucking pair of shears.
[08:57.150 --> 09:00.550]  There's nothing more frustrating than watching people stand around and not able to do work
[09:00.550 --> 09:03.310]  because you don't have enough scissors or you don't have the right tools.
[09:03.310 --> 09:06.910]  If you're going to have a group of people doing it, get a group of shears.
[09:06.910 --> 09:08.910]  I know most of you guys probably have a small garden.
[09:08.910 --> 09:13.310]  It's probably one or two of you and you don't need giant bolt cutter style shears or giant
[09:13.310 --> 09:16.910]  fiskers shears or anything, but I've been in that situation before where I'm watching
[09:16.910 --> 09:21.390]  five guys wait for work because it's just me with a set of shears chopping down every
[09:21.390 --> 09:22.390]  plant.
[09:22.390 --> 09:24.550]  So, have enough shears, have enough gloves.
[09:24.550 --> 09:26.590]  Maybe get a few different sizes of gloves.
[09:26.590 --> 09:29.350]  If you're going to go buy a box of gloves, buy two, maybe three.
[09:29.350 --> 09:32.870]  Get small, medium, and larges or maybe small, large, and extra large.
[09:32.870 --> 09:35.790]  It depends on who's coming over to help you out, but if you're going to have people helping,
[09:35.790 --> 09:39.870]  if they're going to be harvesting and trimming with you, maybe you want a few different size
[09:39.870 --> 09:40.870]  gloves.
[09:40.870 --> 09:42.630]  Here's something I should mention.
[09:42.630 --> 09:46.070]  If you have applied any pesticides to your cannabis plants and you're going to cut them
[09:46.070 --> 09:49.790]  down and have other people work with them, maybe you should politely let those people
[09:49.790 --> 09:53.710]  know what pesticides were applied to your plants so that they can wear long sleeves,
[09:53.710 --> 09:58.470]  they can wear a mask, they can dress appropriately based on their decisions, based on what pesticides
[09:58.470 --> 09:59.550]  you have applied.
[09:59.550 --> 10:00.950]  Some things don't bother me.
[10:00.950 --> 10:05.310]  Some things I would want to put on some long sleeves for and not get that on my arms.
[10:05.310 --> 10:07.310]  Just personal preferences, safety.
[10:07.310 --> 10:08.590]  It's always polite anyway.
[10:08.590 --> 10:13.230]  So the next thing we should talk about is how are we going to hang these plants?
[10:13.230 --> 10:16.390]  Because the next thing you got to buy is something to hang them on.
[10:16.390 --> 10:17.390]  Are you going to use...
[10:17.390 --> 10:20.230]  So the growth store sells this really nice hanger.
[10:20.230 --> 10:23.990]  It's about three feet around and it hangs in the middle and then it's got four or five
[10:23.990 --> 10:26.790]  shelves on it that you can just fill with buds.
[10:26.790 --> 10:30.070]  That's acceptable if you want to cut your buds into small pieces or your branches into
[10:30.070 --> 10:32.470]  small pieces and hang it on there.
[10:32.470 --> 10:35.910]  That's just fine, but that's not the way I would prefer to do it.
[10:35.910 --> 10:39.630]  I prefer to hang the branches so that the buds aren't touching anything so that they
[10:39.630 --> 10:43.790]  don't get a flat spot so that there's not a spot where air can't flow around it.
[10:43.790 --> 10:45.710]  I just prefer to hang them.
[10:45.710 --> 10:47.910]  So in Colorado, we're allowed to grow six plants.
[10:47.910 --> 10:49.790]  Let's say we've got a six plant harvest.
[10:49.790 --> 10:53.870]  I would get six coat hangers or clothes hangers and then I would get some fishing line or
[10:53.870 --> 10:58.510]  some thick hemp twine and I would anchor that to two opposite ends of the room.
[10:58.510 --> 11:01.430]  So I've just got a nice piece of string hanging across the room.
[11:01.430 --> 11:05.950]  Now you can hang the plants on that string if you want to, but if you're using multiple
[11:05.950 --> 11:11.390]  strains maybe you've got six different plants, maybe you've got giant plants, that's when
[11:11.390 --> 11:15.230]  you can cut the plant into smaller pieces and put it on the coat hanger and you can
[11:15.230 --> 11:19.150]  label the coat hanger, this is all sour tangy, this one is all black cherry.
[11:19.510 --> 11:22.550]  That way you don't have one long line of buds that get confused.
[11:22.550 --> 11:24.590]  Also it makes more space.
[11:24.590 --> 11:27.430]  Another thing you're going to need is some sort of labels.
[11:27.430 --> 11:29.310]  You might want to get just some white duct tape.
[11:29.310 --> 11:32.510]  You can always just peel off a piece of duct tape, write on that, stick it wherever you
[11:32.510 --> 11:36.790]  want it or you can get some real labels or you can improvise however you need to, but
[11:36.790 --> 11:40.030]  you're going to want labels if you've got more than one strain.
[11:40.030 --> 11:43.090]  There's nothing worse than getting shit confused right at the end.
[11:43.090 --> 11:44.470]  That's really frustrating.
[11:44.470 --> 11:48.330]  So you've got some way to control the odor.
[11:48.330 --> 11:53.290]  You've got a place thought of and prepared where you can control the temperature, the
[11:53.290 --> 11:57.890]  humidity, the lights, the airflow, the aroma, and the security.
[11:57.890 --> 12:00.550]  You've got that all prepared and you've got the proper tools.
[12:00.550 --> 12:01.650]  You've got gloves.
[12:01.650 --> 12:03.450]  You've got something to cut it down with.
[12:03.450 --> 12:05.490]  You've got something to hang it on.
[12:05.490 --> 12:08.330]  Now let's talk about the room just a little bit.
[12:08.330 --> 12:14.410]  You're going to need, I would recommend, a humidifier and a dehumidifier and also some
[12:14.410 --> 12:17.370]  sort of exhaust fan to get the stale air out of the room.
[12:17.410 --> 12:20.930]  If it's a small space, you can probably just crack the door open, but if you've got a lot
[12:20.930 --> 12:23.050]  of plants in there, you're going to need to exchange some air.
[12:23.050 --> 12:27.170]  You're going to need to get that humid air out of there or the plants will never dry.
[12:27.170 --> 12:29.250]  They'll just get stagnant and funky.
[12:29.250 --> 12:32.190]  Also I may recommend a small fan.
[12:32.190 --> 12:36.250]  You don't want air blowing directly onto the buds, but you want to move that air around.
[12:36.250 --> 12:38.510]  You just don't want it stagnant and funky in there.
[12:38.510 --> 12:40.850]  You really want to be able to control the climate.
[12:40.850 --> 12:44.210]  Also you're going to need something to tell you what's going on in there.
[12:44.210 --> 12:49.610]  A thermometer, a hygrometer, perhaps a PL grow unit.
[12:49.610 --> 12:53.410]  You want something in there so you know what the temperature is and what the humidity is
[12:53.410 --> 12:56.010]  so you can adjust accordingly.
[12:56.010 --> 13:00.190]  Now it feels like we've talked a lot about what to buy and how to prepare, so let's talk
[13:00.190 --> 13:04.170]  a little bit about the settings in the room since we're talking about all this equipment.
[13:04.170 --> 13:09.650]  I like to put a humidifier and a dehumidifier in the room and I set them both at 50%.
[13:09.650 --> 13:13.250]  That way I know that that room is staying right around 50%.
[13:13.290 --> 13:17.810]  If you can set them up to something like a PL grow unit or if you can set them up to
[13:17.810 --> 13:22.370]  something that will trigger them to go off and on based on certain parameters, put them
[13:22.370 --> 13:24.090]  both at 50%.
[13:24.090 --> 13:29.850]  Have the dehumidifier work to 50%, have that humidifier work to 50% and keep that room
[13:29.850 --> 13:34.250]  at 50% humidity as consistently as possible.
[13:34.250 --> 13:37.850]  Now it may be a good idea to have some sort of exhaust fan in the room.
[13:37.850 --> 13:40.630]  Nothing major, just maybe a little four inch exhaustor.
[13:40.630 --> 13:44.330]  If you can do it, if you can just suck the air out of that room occasionally, that would
[13:44.330 --> 13:45.330]  help you out.
[13:45.330 --> 13:47.810]  That would get that old stagnant funky air out of there.
[13:47.810 --> 13:52.670]  If that is not an option, open the door, put a fan by the door, just make sure that air
[13:52.670 --> 13:56.350]  exchanges occasionally so you don't get old air in there.
[13:56.350 --> 14:01.030]  Now inside this room where you've got your dehumidifier, your humidifier and some air
[14:01.030 --> 14:05.830]  exhaust, try to keep it somewhere around 70 degrees in that room.
[14:05.830 --> 14:08.550]  65 to 75 degrees will be ideal.
[14:08.550 --> 14:10.630]  If it gets any hotter, you're going to speed up the drying.
[14:10.630 --> 14:13.350]  It's also going to get funky, it's going to increase humidity.
[14:13.350 --> 14:19.190]  Any cooler, the room will start getting too dry and your buds will get crispy too quickly.
[14:19.190 --> 14:21.990]  So you've got your temperature, you've got your humidity under control, you've got some
[14:21.990 --> 14:23.110]  air exchange.
[14:23.110 --> 14:28.270]  Let's put a small fan in the room, perhaps on the floor just to keep the air moving around
[14:28.270 --> 14:29.630]  or up high in the room.
[14:29.630 --> 14:33.110]  You don't want it right in the middle blowing on the plants too much.
[14:33.110 --> 14:36.870]  That's going to create a dry spot and just dry out some of those buds too quickly.
[14:36.870 --> 14:39.550]  We just want to move the air around so it doesn't get stale.
[14:39.550 --> 14:43.350]  I usually get one of those fans that would sit on your computer desk, just a desk fan.
[14:43.350 --> 14:45.870]  It's a little tiny, like a 12 or 14 inch fan.
[14:45.870 --> 14:47.150]  Put that in the corner on the floor.
[14:47.150 --> 14:48.870]  If you've got a small room, that is plenty.
[14:48.870 --> 14:50.190]  Just move the air around.
[14:50.190 --> 14:55.030]  All right, so that sounds like we've got a pretty good idea of a dry and cure space.
[14:55.030 --> 15:00.110]  Basically a small room or a grow tent that you can control the environment in and you
[15:00.110 --> 15:03.910]  can hang those plants in safely, securely and in the dark.
[15:03.910 --> 15:06.470]  If you need to use a small closet, you can do that.
[15:06.470 --> 15:10.630]  Just make sure that door gets opened and those buds don't get stale in there.
[15:10.630 --> 15:14.470]  Also, like I mentioned earlier, if you don't have sufficient drying space, go ahead and
[15:14.470 --> 15:17.310]  use the flowering room that you flowered the buds in.
[15:17.310 --> 15:21.390]  Or maybe move your next round of plants from the bedroom into that flower and use your
[15:21.390 --> 15:22.390]  bedroom.
[15:22.390 --> 15:25.430]  Grow tents always make nice dry and cure areas.
[15:25.430 --> 15:29.790]  If you're growing in a five by five tent, you could easily dry your whole harvest in
[15:29.790 --> 15:32.030]  maybe a three by three tent.
[15:32.030 --> 15:33.350]  That wouldn't be a problem at all.
[15:33.350 --> 15:36.710]  You don't need that much room to dry your harvest.
[15:36.710 --> 15:37.710]  Well, hopefully you do.
[15:37.710 --> 15:40.950]  Shit, hopefully you need a 10 by 10, but that's not going to be logical.
[15:40.950 --> 15:42.790]  All right, now we know what to buy.
[15:42.790 --> 15:44.550]  We know what supplies we're going to need.
[15:44.550 --> 15:47.430]  We've got a safe space set up for our plants.
[15:47.430 --> 15:50.910]  Hopefully you've been flushing your plants for 10 to 14 days.
[15:50.910 --> 15:53.990]  There's one more thing we should do before we get to chopping these plants.
[15:53.990 --> 15:58.070]  While they are still standing up, we should go and take off all of the big leaves.
[15:58.070 --> 16:01.710]  Any leaf that you can break off with your hand now, just go ahead and take it off.
[16:01.710 --> 16:03.430]  The plants don't need leaves.
[16:03.430 --> 16:04.670]  You're about to harvest them.
[16:04.670 --> 16:07.950]  You can do this seven, five, three days before harvest.
[16:07.950 --> 16:10.230]  You could do it right up before the moment you harvest.
[16:10.230 --> 16:12.470]  Just start taking off all those big leaves.
[16:12.470 --> 16:13.470]  Those leaves are unnecessary.
[16:13.470 --> 16:16.270]  I like to just go in and throw them right on the floor.
[16:16.270 --> 16:18.750]  Just start tearing leaves off, throw them right on the floor and sweep up when you're
[16:18.750 --> 16:20.870]  done because there's going to be a lot of them.
[16:20.870 --> 16:23.030]  Just tear off all of the leaves you can get.
[16:23.030 --> 16:24.070]  You don't need those.
[16:24.070 --> 16:27.430]  This is going to save you time when it comes harvest time.
[16:27.430 --> 16:30.030]  We're going to cut these plants down and let them dry.
[16:30.030 --> 16:34.190]  All those long leaves are just going to dry on there and be in the way and smell funky
[16:34.190 --> 16:37.230]  and they're a sticky bitch to work through once they dry.
[16:37.230 --> 16:38.670]  They're much easier to get off now.
[16:38.670 --> 16:40.830]  So just snap them right off of there.
[16:40.830 --> 16:45.550]  De-leaf this shit out of the entire room before you cut down any of the plants.
[16:45.550 --> 16:50.430]  Once they are all pre-defoliated, that's what I call it, the pre-harvest defoliation, then
[16:50.430 --> 16:53.630]  it is time to start chopping down these plants.
[16:53.630 --> 16:58.670]  Now I don't know how big your plants are, but this is basically how I chop down a plant.
[16:58.670 --> 17:01.310]  I kneel down or if it's on a table, whatever, I walk to it.
[17:01.310 --> 17:05.390]  I usually kneel down to one knee and I grab the plant right above where I'm going to cut.
[17:05.390 --> 17:07.950]  So I've got the stock just a couple inches above the dirt.
[17:07.950 --> 17:12.030]  I get my loppers or whatever you want to call them, your pruners, your shears, and get in
[17:12.030 --> 17:15.550]  there and cut right above the dirt, right below my hand, chop.
[17:15.550 --> 17:16.630]  And now it's going to fall over.
[17:16.630 --> 17:17.870]  It's going to timber on me.
[17:17.870 --> 17:19.710]  If I got a little plant, no problem.
[17:19.710 --> 17:22.110]  If I'm in a three or five gallon pot, I got this by myself.
[17:22.110 --> 17:25.070]  If I've got a bigger plant, I will ask somebody to help me.
[17:25.070 --> 17:27.910]  Hey dude, hold the top of this because when I cut it, it's going to fucking timber down
[17:27.910 --> 17:28.910]  on us.
[17:28.910 --> 17:32.790]  So I would get in there and cut it right at the base.
[17:32.790 --> 17:38.430]  If you have got maybe a tomato cage or some trellising or something like that, maybe figure
[17:38.430 --> 17:41.470]  out how to get the plant out of there by cutting from the top down.
[17:41.470 --> 17:45.910]  I like to cut the whole plant out in one piece and hang the whole thing upside down and let
[17:45.910 --> 17:48.390]  it all dry in one piece.
[17:48.390 --> 17:49.930]  That's the way I like to do it.
[17:49.930 --> 17:54.310]  If you put the plant in a screen of green or a tomato cage, you may have to start at
[17:54.310 --> 17:57.470]  the top and cut out individual branches.
[17:57.470 --> 17:58.970]  That is just fine.
[17:58.970 --> 18:04.190]  Make sure that you keep each branch of each strain together so that you don't mix anything
[18:04.190 --> 18:05.190]  up.
[18:05.190 --> 18:07.170]  I mentioned earlier how frustrating that shit is.
[18:07.170 --> 18:08.790]  Don't mix stuff up.
[18:08.790 --> 18:12.910]  So separate your plant, free your plant from its tomato cage, free the plant from the trellis
[18:12.910 --> 18:16.030]  however you need to, then chop it down.
[18:16.030 --> 18:20.110]  Now if you've got the whole plant chopped down in one piece, just get a ... I get a
[18:20.110 --> 18:21.650]  fuzzy stick is what they're called.
[18:21.650 --> 18:25.950]  They sell them at Hobby Lobby or you can use the twisty ties that come with your trash
[18:25.950 --> 18:28.610]  bags because I never use the twisty ties in the trash bags anyway.
[18:28.610 --> 18:30.270]  They always end up for this purpose.
[18:30.270 --> 18:32.750]  Wrap the twisty tie around the base of the plant.
[18:32.750 --> 18:34.110]  Do it securely.
[18:34.110 --> 18:38.710]  Put a branch in there because it may slide off and then tie that to either your coat
[18:38.710 --> 18:41.470]  hanger or the line that you're going to hang it from.
[18:41.470 --> 18:45.030]  If you've got the line hanging across the room, attach it to that securely.
[18:45.030 --> 18:48.430]  Hang it on there in a way that you know it's not going to fall.
[18:48.430 --> 18:54.150]  If you've got to cut it down into branches, try to cut to where you create little V-shaped
[18:54.150 --> 18:55.150]  intersections.
[18:55.350 --> 18:58.710]  If you lay the plant upside down, you'll see the little wishbone shaped intersections that
[18:58.710 --> 19:03.790]  you can use perfectly to hang your branches on your coat hanger or on your line.
[19:03.790 --> 19:08.590]  Cut the plant, flip it upside down and just hang it in the size of sections that you need
[19:08.590 --> 19:09.590]  to.
[19:09.590 --> 19:10.590]  Here's some advice.
[19:10.590 --> 19:14.910]  If you have to cut your plant down into smaller sections to make it fit, make the sections
[19:14.910 --> 19:16.990]  similar sizes.
[19:16.990 --> 19:19.310]  That way they dry at similar speeds.
[19:19.310 --> 19:22.790]  If you've got one big piece and one little piece, that big piece is going to take longer
[19:22.790 --> 19:23.790]  to dry than the little piece.
[19:23.790 --> 19:27.590]  It's going to cause unevenness and you're going to be confused on what to do.
[19:27.590 --> 19:28.590]  Chop everything.
[19:28.590 --> 19:31.030]  If you're going to chop it, let it all hang in one big piece if you're going to let it
[19:31.030 --> 19:33.430]  hang in one big piece.
[19:33.430 --> 19:35.950]  Cut the plant at the base or pull out the branches.
[19:35.950 --> 19:40.110]  Hang them on the coat hanger either by using the twisty ties and securing it to the coat
[19:40.110 --> 19:44.790]  hanger there or just by using the V-shaped intersections and hanging it like a little
[19:44.790 --> 19:47.030]  hook on the V-shaped intersection.
[19:47.030 --> 19:50.310]  Just get everything hanging safely in your dry and cure room.
[19:50.310 --> 19:52.670]  Chop everything down and just go hang it all up.
[19:52.750 --> 19:55.310]  You're going to be super excited now.
[19:55.310 --> 19:58.310]  You're going to want to go post to all your social media about how you just took down
[19:58.310 --> 20:01.350]  your first harvest, but do not do that.
[20:01.350 --> 20:03.310]  Here is some old school advice.
[20:03.310 --> 20:07.910]  Don't post any pictures or talk about your harvest until it's gone.
[20:07.910 --> 20:12.510]  If it's going out for retail, if it's going into your jar, into your safe, that's when
[20:12.510 --> 20:13.950]  you talk about it.
[20:13.950 --> 20:16.650]  Don't talk about it while that shit is hanging in a room.
[20:16.650 --> 20:18.630]  Don't talk about it while you're trimming it.
[20:18.630 --> 20:20.150]  Don't talk about it yet.
[20:20.150 --> 20:21.150]  Just wait.
[20:21.150 --> 20:22.150]  Okay?
[20:22.630 --> 20:27.510]  Just wait because right now it's hanging in a room and when you go to Walmart and you
[20:27.510 --> 20:31.270]  post that to Facebook also, someone's going in your back fucking door and getting all
[20:31.270 --> 20:34.950]  your weed and they're going to trim it for you and you're never going to see any of it.
[20:34.950 --> 20:36.670]  So don't post yet.
[20:36.670 --> 20:37.670]  Hold off.
[20:37.670 --> 20:38.670]  Just wait.
[20:38.670 --> 20:43.470]  Now if you're chopping down multiple strains, carefully, carefully, carefully label these
[20:43.470 --> 20:44.470]  plants.
[20:44.470 --> 20:45.470]  You're going to...
[20:45.470 --> 20:46.470]  So I'll go back.
[20:46.470 --> 20:47.470]  I'll recap a little bit because I feel like I went fast.
[20:47.470 --> 20:49.110]  Grab it right above the dirt, chop it down.
[20:49.110 --> 20:51.590]  It's going to flip upside down.
[20:51.590 --> 20:52.590]  Flip it upside down.
[20:52.590 --> 20:55.790]  Either put one branch over your line that you're going to hang it on and let it hang
[20:55.790 --> 20:56.790]  right there.
[20:56.790 --> 20:59.670]  Put a label on it or put it on a coat hanger.
[20:59.670 --> 21:02.430]  Just slide the one branch through the coat hanger to where it's got one arm through and
[21:02.430 --> 21:03.430]  then it's just hanging.
[21:03.430 --> 21:07.070]  Put it on the coat hanger or cut it into smaller pieces and do it that way.
[21:07.070 --> 21:10.270]  Label the coat hanger what strain you've got.
[21:10.270 --> 21:13.550]  So cut it down, hang it up, label it.
[21:13.550 --> 21:18.750]  It's going to hang there for somewhere between five and 14, maybe a couple more days.
[21:18.750 --> 21:22.990]  I haven't seen them go more than 14 days in Colorado, but if you're on the coast where
[21:22.990 --> 21:25.310]  you've got humidity, you may get some more time.
[21:25.310 --> 21:28.070]  So you've chopped them down, they're hanging upside down.
[21:28.070 --> 21:29.790]  You've got them labeled.
[21:29.790 --> 21:33.950]  You've got the lights, temperature, humidity, and airflow all controlled in your room.
[21:33.950 --> 21:38.330]  Now you're just going to have to wait somewhere between five and 14 days for those sticks
[21:38.330 --> 21:39.910]  to start snapping.
[21:39.910 --> 21:43.870]  When you bend them, you just want them to go crunch.
[21:43.870 --> 21:45.390]  You don't want them to explode.
[21:45.390 --> 21:48.190]  You don't want them to just crumble up like an old bag of Doritos.
[21:48.190 --> 21:49.470]  You just want them to snap.
[21:49.470 --> 21:51.190]  You don't want a bunch of moisture in there.
[21:51.190 --> 21:53.230]  And check a few of them before you get excited.
[21:53.230 --> 21:58.790]  But when they start snapping consistently, that is when the dry phase has ended and it
[21:58.790 --> 22:02.190]  is time to work yourself into the cure phase.
[22:02.190 --> 22:03.190]  All right.
[22:03.190 --> 22:06.730]  Now I did skip the part about putting them on the dry racks that I talked about you could
[22:06.730 --> 22:08.110]  get from the grocery store.
[22:08.110 --> 22:09.950]  The grocery store sells these dry racks.
[22:09.950 --> 22:11.630]  They look like a 22 inch kick drum head.
[22:11.630 --> 22:14.430]  I think they're about 24 inches around.
[22:14.430 --> 22:17.510]  They're meshy and they're kind of cheap, but they work really well.
[22:17.830 --> 22:19.470]  You just hang it up.
[22:19.470 --> 22:25.070]  And for this, I would probably take the buds off of the sticks and just put just the buds
[22:25.070 --> 22:26.950]  into those racks.
[22:26.950 --> 22:28.790]  I wouldn't put the sticks in there.
[22:28.790 --> 22:31.750]  I feel like the sticks are going to take up a lot of space in there and they also get
[22:31.750 --> 22:34.710]  stuck in the fucking netting a whole lot and they're a pain in the ass.
[22:34.710 --> 22:39.550]  I would cut every single bud off of the stick, if it were me, and I would lay the buds in
[22:39.550 --> 22:42.130]  there and I would spread them out kind of far.
[22:42.130 --> 22:45.630]  And then every morning when I wake up, I would go in there and just move those buds around
[22:45.750 --> 22:47.910]  and kind of shuffle them around a little bit.
[22:47.910 --> 22:52.030]  That's not the ideal way to do it, but I understand that some of us are limited on space.
[22:52.030 --> 22:55.430]  If that's what you've got to do, that's what you have got to do.
[22:55.430 --> 22:58.830]  I would rather see you hang them until they dry and get a little drier.
[22:58.830 --> 23:02.630]  And as soon as the stick snaps, then get it off the stick.
[23:02.630 --> 23:06.310]  But I understand that sometimes you've got to improvise.
[23:06.310 --> 23:10.150]  That's part of being a good grower, being able to adjust, adapt, and improvise with
[23:10.150 --> 23:12.190]  what you've got when you've got it.
[23:12.190 --> 23:14.150]  People are so fucking spoiled now.
[23:14.150 --> 23:19.550]  You've got these giant facilities with parking lots and security cameras and loading bays
[23:19.550 --> 23:20.550]  and friends.
[23:20.550 --> 23:23.230]  When I first started doing this, you couldn't talk about it.
[23:23.230 --> 23:26.270]  You couldn't have your friends help you carry your grow shit into the house because now
[23:26.270 --> 23:29.510]  they know you're growing and they're going to want something or they're going to fucking
[23:29.510 --> 23:30.510]  steal it.
[23:30.510 --> 23:33.670]  And if you need more space, you just call a contractor and you get a building permit and
[23:33.670 --> 23:36.710]  you just build out another room and you've got a drying cure area.
[23:36.710 --> 23:38.270]  Back in the day, we couldn't do that.
[23:38.270 --> 23:40.310]  You would catch people drying their fucking weed in the bathroom.
[23:40.310 --> 23:42.030]  Hey man, I got to piss while I'm at your house.
[23:42.030 --> 23:43.150]  No bro, you can't pee here.
[23:43.150 --> 23:44.150]  What man?
[23:44.150 --> 23:45.150]  I just got to pee.
[23:45.150 --> 23:46.150]  No bro, you can't pee.
[23:46.150 --> 23:49.030]  And then you catch on later that he was drying and curing his fucking weed in the bathroom.
[23:49.030 --> 23:51.270]  Anyway, I got rambly there.
[23:51.270 --> 23:53.230]  Those dry racks are cool if that's what you got to do.
[23:53.230 --> 23:55.070]  Of course, I would prefer to hang it.
[23:55.070 --> 23:56.790]  I'd prefer to hang it whole plant.
[23:56.790 --> 23:59.270]  I'd prefer to hang it until it starts snapping.
[23:59.270 --> 24:01.910]  Like I said, that's when we enter the cure phase.
[24:01.910 --> 24:06.230]  Now, if you didn't have time or the forethought to start defoliating your plants before you
[24:06.230 --> 24:10.150]  harvested, don't be afraid to go in there and take off all the excess leaves while they're
[24:10.150 --> 24:11.150]  hanging upside down.
[24:11.150 --> 24:12.590]  It is never too late to do that.
[24:12.590 --> 24:15.870]  All right, you guys, I feel like I can recrap.
[24:15.870 --> 24:17.550]  Let's recrap what I said.
[24:17.550 --> 24:19.510]  Probably a recap would be better for a podcast.
[24:19.510 --> 24:20.510]  Let's recap a little bit.
[24:20.510 --> 24:21.950]  You need the appropriate tools.
[24:21.950 --> 24:23.230]  You need the appropriate equipment.
[24:23.230 --> 24:24.230]  You need a good room.
[24:24.230 --> 24:27.190]  You need to be able to control the temperature and humidity.
[24:27.190 --> 24:28.670]  You don't want people getting in there.
[24:28.670 --> 24:30.530]  You need to control the aroma.
[24:30.530 --> 24:31.530]  You're going to need some gloves.
[24:31.530 --> 24:35.470]  You're going to need something to hang your plants on, and you're going to need some sort
[24:35.470 --> 24:39.030]  of labels if you're growing more than one string.
[24:39.030 --> 24:42.870]  It's a good idea to start pre-defoliating if you can get in there and take off the leaves
[24:42.870 --> 24:43.870]  before.
[24:43.870 --> 24:45.950]  The chop down process is fairly simple.
[24:45.950 --> 24:49.910]  Grab it, chop it, hang that motherfucker upside down, and let it start drying.
[24:49.910 --> 24:52.990]  We know what temperature and humidity we need to keep the dry in cure room.
[24:52.990 --> 24:56.510]  We want about 50%, about 70 degrees.
[24:56.510 --> 24:59.990]  Let those plants hang for four or five days and start snapping the stems and see if they
[24:59.990 --> 25:00.990]  pop.
[25:00.990 --> 25:05.610]  It'll be five, seven, 10, maybe 14 days before they're ready to go into containers.
[25:05.610 --> 25:06.870]  That's when we're going to jar them up.
[25:06.870 --> 25:08.870]  That's where we're going to put them into containers.
[25:08.910 --> 25:10.790]  That's when the cure process is going to start.
[25:10.790 --> 25:15.390]  I think we've got a good grasp on how to harvest our plants.
[25:15.390 --> 25:19.630]  The next step in harvesting, you guys, is to get in there and clean and reset the grow
[25:19.630 --> 25:20.630]  room.
[25:20.630 --> 25:21.630]  That's right.
[25:21.630 --> 25:22.630]  It may be time to buy new bulbs.
[25:22.630 --> 25:25.350]  It may be time to change your air conditioner filters.
[25:25.350 --> 25:29.110]  It is certainly time to clean the cover on your carbon filter.
[25:29.110 --> 25:31.470]  Also maybe get in there and scrub the lenses.
[25:31.470 --> 25:35.870]  If you've got glass lenses on your ducted hoods, it's a good time to get in there and
[25:35.870 --> 25:37.210]  scrub that shit out.
[25:37.210 --> 25:39.450]  Make sure that everything is nice and clean.
[25:39.450 --> 25:43.770]  Clean the room with a cleaning product, maybe some bleach, maybe some Fizan, whatever you've
[25:43.770 --> 25:44.770]  got.
[25:44.770 --> 25:47.170]  Get in there and clean the shit out of the grow room.
[25:47.170 --> 25:48.930]  Get in the corners.
[25:48.930 --> 25:51.010]  Get in all the spots you've been missing.
[25:51.010 --> 25:55.250]  If you plan on using your grow room or your grow hut as your drying space, that's a good
[25:55.250 --> 25:58.450]  excuse but you're going to have to clean it as soon as you're done with that.
[25:58.450 --> 26:01.710]  As soon as those plants come out of there and you're trimming, you should take a break
[26:01.710 --> 26:06.290]  and go clean the shit out of your grow space before you put more plants in there.
[26:06.370 --> 26:09.050]  That is the completion of your harvest.
[26:09.050 --> 26:12.930]  That is also the completion of your harvest lesson, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:12.930 --> 26:14.010]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[26:14.010 --> 26:18.130]  I think the next episode, I have a guest scheduled.
[26:18.130 --> 26:22.210]  There will be another episode before the dry and cure episode but there is an in-depth
[26:22.210 --> 26:24.410]  dry and cure episode coming up.
[26:24.410 --> 26:26.570]  We'll also talk about trimming a little bit.
[26:26.570 --> 26:30.450]  Then I think we're going to continue with grow lessons and we're going to start over.
[26:30.450 --> 26:35.430]  We're going to go right into germinating seeds and cutting clones and getting a grow started
[26:35.550 --> 26:36.550]  all over again.
[26:36.550 --> 26:39.750]  I've got a lot of fun things planned out for the podcast.
[26:39.750 --> 26:40.750]  Please stick around, you guys.
[26:40.750 --> 26:44.110]  I think you will enjoy what I have planned for everybody.
[26:44.110 --> 26:45.350]  You guys, I want to give some shout outs.
[26:45.350 --> 26:49.550]  Let's give a huge shout out to my friend Melanie Alexander and also a gigantic shout out to
[26:49.550 --> 26:50.550]  Aaron Johnson.
[26:50.550 --> 26:56.390]  I also want to give a huge shout out to everybody who contributed to the Patreon campaign.
[26:56.390 --> 26:57.390]  Thank you.
[26:57.390 --> 26:58.390]  I appreciate it.
[26:58.390 --> 27:03.110]  Also, a shout out to everybody who messaged me and let me know that Stitcher was not working
[27:03.110 --> 27:04.110]  properly.
[27:04.110 --> 27:05.110]  That's huge help.
[27:05.790 --> 27:06.790]  He tells me, I don't know, it's broken.
[27:06.790 --> 27:07.790]  I can't fix it.
[27:07.790 --> 27:08.790]  Thanks for reaching out.
[27:08.790 --> 27:11.430]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you guys for listening to the podcast.

[28:26.710 --> 28:28.190]  All right, podcast world.
[28:28.190 --> 28:30.830]  I'm going to jump in and cut off this old episode.
[28:30.830 --> 28:32.710]  I want to thank you again for listening.
[28:32.710 --> 28:36.110]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[28:36.110 --> 28:39.350]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[28:39.350 --> 28:41.350]  Hey, welcome to the show, podcast world.
[28:41.350 --> 28:44.830]  It is time for episode 391 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[28:44.830 --> 28:47.810]  This episode is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[28:47.810 --> 28:51.870]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds.
[28:51.870 --> 28:57.750]  You can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[28:57.750 --> 29:01.670]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing
[29:01.670 --> 29:02.670]  on.
[29:02.670 --> 29:06.670]  Today, I'm taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[29:06.670 --> 29:08.310]  You guys know that I love the Stardog.
[29:08.310 --> 29:09.310]  I love the aroma.
[29:09.310 --> 29:13.150]  I love the flavor, and I love the head buzz that it gives me.
[29:13.150 --> 29:17.110]  If you've been following along with the podcast, you know that I've been doing a long series
[29:17.110 --> 29:18.550]  of grow lessons.
[29:18.550 --> 29:23.350]  At this point in the grow lessons, it is time to dry and cure our freshly harvested cannabis
[29:23.350 --> 29:24.350]  crop.
[29:24.350 --> 29:29.590]  To continue this lesson, I'm going to repost episode number 326, my original dry and cure
[29:29.590 --> 29:30.590]  episode.
[29:30.590 --> 29:36.230]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's time travel back to episode 326, and let's recap drying and
[29:36.230 --> 29:38.230]  curing our freshly harvested cannabis.
[29:38.230 --> 29:39.230]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[29:39.230 --> 29:40.230]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[29:40.230 --> 29:41.230]  news, education, and conversation.
[29:41.230 --> 29:42.230]  That's right.
[29:42.230 --> 29:43.230]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[29:43.230 --> 29:44.230]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist, if you're a cannabis expert, if you're a cannabis
[29:44.230 --> 29:58.310]  activist, or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis, this,
[29:58.310 --> 30:00.310]  my friends, is the podcast for you.
[30:00.310 --> 30:02.710]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[30:02.710 --> 30:05.790]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[30:05.790 --> 30:09.750]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[30:09.750 --> 30:14.130]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[30:14.130 --> 30:17.570]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[30:17.570 --> 30:21.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[30:21.730 --> 30:31.210]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[30:31.210 --> 30:32.410]  Welcome to the show, internet world.
[30:32.410 --> 30:35.690]  It is time for episode 326 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[30:35.690 --> 30:37.250]  Thanks again for joining me.
[30:37.250 --> 30:41.050]  I have got a very detailed episode planned out for you.
[30:41.050 --> 30:45.610]  This is going to be the long awaited, long anticipated dry and cure episode.
[30:45.610 --> 30:47.730]  We have done an episode on determining ripeness.
[30:47.730 --> 30:50.490]  We did an episode on harvesting your plants.
[30:50.490 --> 30:53.610]  Now it is time to dry and cure our cannabis plants.
[30:53.610 --> 30:56.870]  Before we get there, let's cover a little bit of business.
[30:56.870 --> 31:00.050]  This episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella
[31:00.050 --> 31:01.250]  Dank Seed Company.
[31:01.250 --> 31:05.210]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella
[31:05.210 --> 31:06.210]  Dank Seed Company.
[31:06.210 --> 31:09.490]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[31:09.490 --> 31:13.690]  Ladies and gentlemen, please support my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[31:13.690 --> 31:18.130]  Also, this podcast is brought to you by our friends at PL Grow Systems.
[31:18.130 --> 31:21.730]  You should know what's going on in your grow room at all times, and you can pay close attention
[31:21.730 --> 31:23.810]  with the PL Grow Minder Unit.
[31:23.810 --> 31:28.490]  Check out my friends at PL Grow Systems at plgrow.systems.
[31:28.490 --> 31:30.050]  One more order of business.
[31:30.050 --> 31:34.350]  A lot of people let me know that the episode with Deb and Granny and Giddyup and Max had
[31:34.350 --> 31:36.010]  an audio issue.
[31:36.010 --> 31:38.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, that audio issue has been corrected.
[31:38.730 --> 31:42.590]  If you were frustrated listening to that show, I encourage you to go back and check
[31:42.590 --> 31:45.690]  out the corrected audio version of that podcast.
[31:45.690 --> 31:49.490]  Thanks for being patient with me, and big thanks to everybody who let me know there
[31:49.490 --> 31:52.970]  was a technical issue.
[31:52.970 --> 31:57.450]  Speaking of technical issues, I am still working with Stitcher to resolve the technical issues
[31:57.450 --> 31:59.470]  that happen randomly.
[31:59.470 --> 32:01.570]  Some episodes will play for some people.
[32:01.570 --> 32:03.930]  Some episodes randomly will not play for people.
[32:03.930 --> 32:08.650]  The only people experiencing the technical issues are people who are listening to the
[32:08.650 --> 32:13.170]  podcast through the Stitcher application on an Android device.
[32:13.170 --> 32:14.210]  Sometimes it works for you.
[32:14.210 --> 32:15.210]  Sometimes it doesn't.
[32:15.210 --> 32:16.510]  I'm not sure what's causing it.
[32:16.510 --> 32:17.730]  We thought we had it narrowed down.
[32:17.730 --> 32:19.210]  We corrected a couple of things.
[32:19.210 --> 32:20.450]  It has done it again.
[32:20.450 --> 32:23.650]  I will keep working at getting that resolved.
[32:23.650 --> 32:27.350]  If you can't listen to the episodes through Stitcher, through the application, you can
[32:27.350 --> 32:29.010]  always go to the Stitcher website.
[32:29.010 --> 32:30.210]  You can find the show there.
[32:30.210 --> 32:32.150]  Also, you can find the show on YouTube.
[32:32.150 --> 32:35.270]  I'm trying to keep all of the episodes updated on YouTube.
[32:35.270 --> 32:37.630]  I apologize if Stitcher is fighting you.
[32:37.630 --> 32:39.070]  I am working on it.
[32:39.070 --> 32:42.510]  The tech team and the customer support team at Stitcher are helping me, and we cannot
[32:42.510 --> 32:43.830]  find the problem.
[32:43.830 --> 32:44.830]  All right.
[32:44.830 --> 32:48.750]  I feel like I've gotten most of the technical business out of the way.
[32:48.750 --> 32:50.630]  Let's get into a podcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[32:50.630 --> 32:54.310]  You know I like to start the episodes off by letting you know what I am smoking on.
[32:54.310 --> 32:58.430]  Today, I've got the honor of dabbing some sauce made by a friend.
[32:58.430 --> 33:00.710]  This was locally grown and locally extracted.
[33:00.710 --> 33:03.790]  My buddy doesn't want to be mentioned on the show, so I'm not going to say his name.
[33:03.790 --> 33:05.150]  Dude, thanks for the great work.
[33:05.150 --> 33:06.390]  My friend grew some cream.
[33:06.390 --> 33:07.790]  Of course, I bred the cream.
[33:07.790 --> 33:09.830]  The cream is cookies and cream to a rise.
[33:09.830 --> 33:11.550]  I passed along some seeds.
[33:11.550 --> 33:12.550]  He grew it.
[33:12.550 --> 33:13.550]  He harvested it.
[33:13.550 --> 33:15.550]  He extracted it and made sauce out of it.
[33:15.550 --> 33:18.670]  Then he was kind enough to bring me a couple of sample jars.
[33:18.670 --> 33:21.470]  You guys, this stuff is tremendous.
[33:21.470 --> 33:23.230]  It's almost gone because it is so delicious.
[33:23.230 --> 33:26.710]  He brought me a little sample of straight isolated crystals.
[33:26.710 --> 33:29.830]  He brought me a little sample of straight isolated turps.
[33:29.950 --> 33:32.710]  He also brought me a sample of the two combined.
[33:32.710 --> 33:36.390]  I've got the turps, I've got the crystals, and then I've got the saucy mixture put together
[33:36.390 --> 33:38.350]  at a beautiful ratio.
[33:38.350 --> 33:44.710]  You guys, the mixture smells like cupcake frosting and cookie dough.
[33:44.710 --> 33:48.910]  When you take a dab of it, it tastes like you just took a big bite of cookie dough with
[33:48.910 --> 33:50.350]  cupcake frosting on it.
[33:50.350 --> 33:54.110]  Then when you blow it out, it smells like somebody's baking fresh cookies in the room.
[33:54.110 --> 33:58.790]  It smells like warm chocolate chip and cinnamon cookies filling the room.
[33:58.790 --> 34:00.670]  This concentrate is excellent.
[34:00.670 --> 34:01.670]  It is super smooth.
[34:01.670 --> 34:03.870]  I took a couple of gigantic dabs.
[34:03.870 --> 34:05.150]  There was no throat tingle.
[34:05.150 --> 34:07.150]  There was no heaviness on the exhale.
[34:07.150 --> 34:10.030]  Super smooth, super clean, super delicious concentrates.
[34:10.030 --> 34:14.470]  Dude, I know you don't want me to say your name on the air, but great product, great
[34:14.470 --> 34:15.470]  work.
[34:15.470 --> 34:16.590]  You did a hell of a job with this.
[34:16.590 --> 34:17.590]  This stuff tastes amazing.
[34:17.590 --> 34:19.750]  The only problem is that it is almost gone.
[34:19.750 --> 34:23.830]  I've probably got one or two dabs before this stuff is extinct.
[34:23.830 --> 34:28.750]  Bro, come back with a bigger jar and let's make a deal.
[34:28.750 --> 34:32.630]  All right, you guys, I'm obviously loving these cream dabs grown and extracted by a
[34:32.630 --> 34:33.630]  local farmer.
[34:33.630 --> 34:34.630]  Hey, bro, great work.
[34:34.630 --> 34:36.190]  I truly do appreciate it.
[34:36.190 --> 34:39.190]  In fact, this episode is going to be really long.
[34:39.190 --> 34:40.910]  I've got all of the opening business covered.
[34:40.910 --> 34:41.950]  I'm going to press pause.
[34:41.950 --> 34:45.350]  I'm going to take a dab, probably the last two dabs of this cream.
[34:45.350 --> 34:50.390]  When I get back, I will give a long lesson on drying and curing your freshly harvested
[34:50.390 --> 34:51.390]  cannabis plants.
[34:51.390 --> 34:54.270]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[34:54.270 --> 34:55.430]  I am well medicated.
[34:55.430 --> 35:00.270]  I am well hydrated and I am ready to talk about drying and curing your freshly harvested
[35:00.270 --> 35:01.270]  cannabis plants.
[35:01.270 --> 35:04.390]  Now, let me do a quick update from the last episode.
[35:04.390 --> 35:07.550]  In the last episode, we talked about harvesting your plants.
[35:07.550 --> 35:08.790]  We talked about cutting them down.
[35:08.790 --> 35:12.710]  We talked about hanging them in a room upside down in a climate controlled room.
[35:12.710 --> 35:17.550]  One thing I failed to mention, you should only hang one crop in a space at a time to
[35:17.550 --> 35:21.910]  prevent re-moisturizing the first crop.
[35:21.910 --> 35:26.750]  Cut down one crop and then let it hang for four or five days, five or seven days, and
[35:26.750 --> 35:30.390]  then bring in a fresh crop and lock that in the same room because what you're doing is
[35:30.390 --> 35:34.550]  just introducing a whole bunch of moisture into that room and it's just going to go into
[35:34.550 --> 35:35.550]  the other plants.
[35:35.550 --> 35:38.270]  You're going to re-moisten the other plants and make them take longer.
[35:38.270 --> 35:43.110]  Now, you've got to restart your dry and cure process.
[35:43.110 --> 35:46.150]  One crop at a time is ideal hanging in the room.
[35:46.150 --> 35:49.630]  That's something I should have mentioned on the episode before and I didn't remember to
[35:49.630 --> 35:50.630]  mention that.
[35:50.830 --> 35:52.030]  Now we are up to speed.
[35:52.030 --> 35:57.390]  Now, let's actually get into drying and curing our freshly harvested cannabis plants.
[35:57.390 --> 36:04.190]  Now, after spending four weeks in veg, eight to 10 weeks in flour, you really don't want
[36:04.190 --> 36:06.990]  to mess these plants up at the very end here.
[36:06.990 --> 36:08.950]  Curing is a very critical process.
[36:08.950 --> 36:14.750]  Curing, you can make the most delicious buds taste like total shit from drying and curing
[36:14.750 --> 36:16.270]  them improperly.
[36:16.270 --> 36:18.310]  You can ruin the entire crop at this point.
[36:18.310 --> 36:21.550]  Don't get too scared because I'm going to guide you through not ruining it, but keep
[36:21.550 --> 36:26.190]  in mind that this is one of the most critical parts in the growing process.
[36:26.190 --> 36:31.470]  This is a huge process and a lot of things can go wrong if you don't pay attention.
[36:31.470 --> 36:36.550]  Take your time and pay attention and don't rush to smoke your new crop.
[36:36.550 --> 36:41.950]  You've waited, what do we say, about 14 weeks probably is what we did the math on, 120 days.
[36:41.950 --> 36:45.710]  You've grown these plants for 120 days is about how long it takes.
[36:45.710 --> 36:49.950]  Why not wait a couple of days longer until they are perfect before you start smoking
[36:49.950 --> 36:50.950]  it?
[36:50.950 --> 36:53.390]  Let's get into actually drying and curing these plants.
[36:53.390 --> 36:57.910]  Now, the last grow episode was a harvest episode and it left us with our plants hanging upside
[36:57.910 --> 37:01.950]  down in a room with proper temps, proper humidity, and minimal light.
[37:01.950 --> 37:05.670]  Now, we've been waiting for the sticks for our plants to snap.
[37:05.670 --> 37:07.430]  We've got plants hanging upside down.
[37:07.430 --> 37:08.430]  They've been de-leafed.
[37:08.430 --> 37:13.150]  We're just waiting for the right humidity within the plants for the sticks to pop.
[37:13.150 --> 37:14.630]  The sticks should snap.
[37:14.630 --> 37:16.530]  We're waiting for them to snap but not explode.
[37:16.530 --> 37:21.510]  When you grab a branch of the plant and you just bend it, you want it to sound kind of
[37:21.510 --> 37:22.510]  like that.
[37:22.510 --> 37:25.430]  You don't want it to go, you don't want it to explode with dryness.
[37:25.430 --> 37:30.390]  You don't want it to fall apart and you don't want it to be gummy or rubbery or bendy.
[37:30.390 --> 37:31.790]  You don't want it to bend.
[37:31.790 --> 37:33.830]  You want it to snap and pop.
[37:33.830 --> 37:35.750]  The sticks should snap.
[37:35.750 --> 37:39.750]  The bigger sticks and larger plants are going to take a little bit longer.
[37:39.750 --> 37:43.270]  The skinnier sticks and smaller plants are obviously going to dry more quickly because
[37:43.270 --> 37:45.110]  they don't hold as much moisture.
[37:45.110 --> 37:50.210]  Also, if you took off less leaf or more leaf, they're going to dry more quickly without
[37:50.210 --> 37:53.750]  the leaf and they're going to take a little longer with that extra leaf on there because
[37:53.750 --> 37:55.790]  it's going to hold more moisture.
[37:55.790 --> 38:00.110]  There'll be more moisture in the room, just more moisture overall to deal with.
[38:00.110 --> 38:02.950]  What we're waiting for is those sticks to snap.
[38:02.950 --> 38:07.310]  When the sticks snap, that's when the container curing process begins.
[38:07.310 --> 38:10.750]  I use two different methods for this based on crop size.
[38:10.750 --> 38:13.030]  Don't forget that I run commercial grows.
[38:13.030 --> 38:16.630]  In a commercial setting, we do things a little differently than we would do in a home setting.
[38:16.630 --> 38:19.070]  I'm used to pulling down 50 or more pounds.
[38:19.070 --> 38:22.030]  In a commercial environment, you don't want a bunch of jars.
[38:22.030 --> 38:23.790]  You don't really have the space for a bunch of jars.
[38:23.790 --> 38:26.590]  You don't have the manpower to open a bunch of jars all day.
[38:26.590 --> 38:27.990]  We do things a little differently.
[38:27.990 --> 38:30.630]  In a home grow, it's not as many pounds.
[38:30.630 --> 38:31.750]  It's less jars.
[38:31.750 --> 38:34.630]  I use jar technique in a home grow.
[38:34.630 --> 38:38.070]  Let's talk about the way I would do it in a commercial grow.
[38:38.070 --> 38:42.390]  In a commercial grow, I'll chop the large stalk and naked stems out of the plants and
[38:42.390 --> 38:47.190]  place the buds still on sticks into large rubber-made containers.
[38:47.190 --> 38:48.430]  You've got a big plant.
[38:48.430 --> 38:51.590]  You've lollipopped up probably 12 to 18 inches of it.
[38:51.590 --> 38:52.590]  You've got some naked sticks.
[38:52.590 --> 38:57.150]  That's what I mean by naked sticks, the shaved legs and that main big stalk.
[38:57.150 --> 38:58.750]  I'll cut all of that out.
[38:58.750 --> 38:59.750]  That goes to waste.
[38:59.750 --> 39:04.630]  In a commercial grow, that's actually got to be weighed and documented as removed waste.
[39:04.630 --> 39:06.390]  Now, I've got two piles.
[39:06.390 --> 39:09.590]  One pile is naked sticks that need to be documented as waste.
[39:09.590 --> 39:11.630]  They'll be chipped up and thrown away.
[39:11.630 --> 39:12.630]  Then there's another pile.
[39:12.630 --> 39:16.470]  That's the usable product of the sticks with buds up it that need to be trimmed.
[39:16.470 --> 39:21.390]  Those buds still on the sticks get put into the rubber-made containers untrimmed.
[39:21.390 --> 39:24.150]  Now, here's something to keep in mind.
[39:24.150 --> 39:26.070]  Carefully label your rubber-made containers.
[39:26.070 --> 39:27.430]  Do not label the lids.
[39:27.430 --> 39:28.950]  Never label lids.
[39:28.950 --> 39:32.430]  In a facility, in a home grow, don't label the lids.
[39:32.430 --> 39:33.790]  Lids are interchangeable.
[39:33.790 --> 39:35.910]  Label the container.
[39:35.910 --> 39:37.050]  Cut the sticks out.
[39:37.050 --> 39:40.030]  Put the good usable buds into the rubber-made container.
[39:40.030 --> 39:41.310]  Don't squish them in there too tight.
[39:41.310 --> 39:43.870]  Fill it up pretty well, but don't cram anything in there.
[39:43.870 --> 39:46.390]  You need some air space in there and you don't want to smash anything.
[39:46.390 --> 39:49.190]  If it's too tightly pressed together, it'll get funky.
[39:49.190 --> 39:50.670]  It'll start to smell bad.
[39:50.670 --> 39:54.470]  Moisture will get trapped in there and you'll start to get that stale ammonia smell.
[39:54.470 --> 39:57.750]  That's what we're trying to avoid with proper drying and curing.
[39:57.750 --> 40:02.390]  I would go through and remove all of the sticks, get all the good buds into the containers.
[40:02.390 --> 40:06.310]  Once they are all completed, I would go through and put the lids on every container at that
[40:06.310 --> 40:07.310]  point.
[40:07.310 --> 40:08.310]  I would have everything labeled.
[40:08.310 --> 40:09.310]  It'd all be sitting open.
[40:09.310 --> 40:13.470]  Then when we're done with every plant that's going to get binned that day, that's when
[40:13.470 --> 40:15.990]  I start putting the lids on and sealing up the containers.
[40:15.990 --> 40:19.230]  Now, I feel like I haven't described these containers properly.
[40:19.230 --> 40:24.270]  These rubber-made containers are like the size of maybe a laundry basket.
[40:24.270 --> 40:31.150]  They're about three feet wide, I guess, and then maybe a foot or so wide.
[40:31.190 --> 40:35.270]  I know I said wide, but three feet long and a foot or so wide, and then probably about
[40:35.270 --> 40:37.470]  18, maybe 20 inches deep.
[40:37.470 --> 40:41.670]  They're the one that you use for packing, or you just put a bunch of clothes in there,
[40:41.670 --> 40:42.670]  just a bunch of bullshit.
[40:42.670 --> 40:45.510]  It's the one when the kids come to the front door and they're trying to sell candy for
[40:45.510 --> 40:46.510]  church.
[40:46.510 --> 40:47.510]  I got some candy for church.
[40:47.510 --> 40:48.510]  I said, would you like to raise some money?
[40:48.510 --> 40:50.430]  They got the big rubber-made container.
[40:50.430 --> 40:52.430]  That's the container I'm talking about.
[40:52.430 --> 40:55.990]  It's just like a moving box or something is what it looks like, a storage container.
[40:55.990 --> 41:01.150]  We can fit three or four large plants in those containers from the commercial grow.
[41:01.150 --> 41:04.150]  I guess I should have mentioned that a little earlier, but it just dawned on me that I did
[41:04.150 --> 41:06.390]  not describe these containers in any way.
[41:06.390 --> 41:11.850]  Now, let's talk more about what happens to these plants once they are put into this container
[41:11.850 --> 41:13.930]  and the lid is put on them.
[41:13.930 --> 41:18.550]  They need to be opened and rotated every day until they're dry enough to seal up without
[41:18.550 --> 41:20.150]  risking any mold development.
[41:20.150 --> 41:21.510]  The first day is always scary.
[41:21.510 --> 41:25.830]  When you seal them up and then leave overnight, that is always a scary feeling until you get
[41:25.830 --> 41:27.790]  there the next day.
[41:27.790 --> 41:31.210]  Don't be afraid to leave them open if you feel like they're a little too moist.
[41:31.210 --> 41:34.610]  If you cut them down and get them in the bin and realize, ah shit, a couple of these are
[41:34.610 --> 41:38.370]  too wet, don't be afraid to leave those open overnight.
[41:38.370 --> 41:42.090]  You would rather leave them open and get them a little too dry than close them up and get
[41:42.090 --> 41:43.230]  them a little funky.
[41:43.230 --> 41:44.990]  A little funky doesn't go away.
[41:44.990 --> 41:47.850]  A little too dry we can work with.
[41:47.850 --> 41:50.970]  You seal them up, you put the lids on them, and then you might want to check on them before
[41:50.970 --> 41:52.070]  you leave for the day.
[41:52.070 --> 41:55.010]  Make sure that nothing needs to be rotated, nothing needs to be flipped around, nothing
[41:55.190 --> 41:56.190]  needs to be left open.
[41:56.190 --> 41:59.110]  Like I said, if it needs to be left open, leave it open.
[41:59.110 --> 42:00.110]  Don't be afraid.
[42:00.110 --> 42:01.510]  Then, you're going to leave.
[42:01.510 --> 42:02.750]  You're going to come back the next day.
[42:02.750 --> 42:04.590]  You're going to have a bunch of sealed containers.
[42:04.590 --> 42:07.030]  They need to be popped open immediately.
[42:07.030 --> 42:12.470]  I would pop them open for four, maybe six, maybe seven hours and check on them.
[42:12.470 --> 42:17.130]  While they were sealed, a lot of the moisture that was inside those sticks reconstituted
[42:17.130 --> 42:18.510]  throughout those buds.
[42:18.510 --> 42:20.490]  A lot of moisture built up in that container.
[42:20.490 --> 42:23.790]  You're going to find a lot of spongy and wet buds when you come in in the morning.
[42:23.790 --> 42:24.790]  It's expected.
[42:24.790 --> 42:25.790]  Don't worry.
[42:25.790 --> 42:26.790]  It'll be okay.
[42:26.790 --> 42:28.970]  You're going to leave it open and get some of that shit out of there.
[42:28.970 --> 42:30.350]  That's the idea.
[42:30.350 --> 42:33.390]  You want to open it up every day and let that stuff out of there.
[42:33.390 --> 42:36.850]  When they start getting dry again, some of the sticks might not even snap again.
[42:36.850 --> 42:40.030]  Some of them may have re-moistened to where they don't snap.
[42:40.030 --> 42:43.330]  That means you may have gone just a little bit too early, but it's not bad because we
[42:43.330 --> 42:44.850]  can get that moisture out.
[42:44.850 --> 42:46.390]  You don't want it to get too dry.
[42:46.390 --> 42:48.150]  You're going to pop them open.
[42:48.150 --> 42:49.390]  You're going to see how wet they are.
[42:49.390 --> 42:50.390]  Leave them open.
[42:50.390 --> 42:51.910]  You may just want to leave them open for an hour.
[42:51.910 --> 42:54.150]  If they're real dry, an hour is fine.
[42:54.150 --> 42:57.850]  Four to six hours is not uncommon on the first day.
[42:57.850 --> 43:02.330]  If you chop those plants down or if you bend those plants a little bit too early, they
[43:02.330 --> 43:03.650]  may be really wet.
[43:03.650 --> 43:07.230]  You may have to leave them open for four to six, maybe the whole shift of eight to 10
[43:07.230 --> 43:08.230]  hours.
[43:08.230 --> 43:09.230]  They may have to stay open.
[43:09.230 --> 43:10.230]  That's not uncommon.
[43:10.230 --> 43:14.030]  Try not to cut them down and put them into the bends so early next time, but you'll be
[43:14.030 --> 43:15.030]  okay.
[43:15.030 --> 43:18.810]  This is something you're going to have to dial in with your facility and with your technique.
[43:18.810 --> 43:23.730]  The duration of burp time is going to decrease slowly as the buds dry.
[43:23.730 --> 43:30.970]  These bends are going to sit in a room, ideally, that is at 50% humidity and 70 degrees until
[43:30.970 --> 43:32.610]  you have time to trim them.
[43:32.610 --> 43:38.690]  I run a humidifier and a dehumidifier at the same time, and they're both set at 50% humidity.
[43:38.690 --> 43:43.390]  If that room gets to 55% humidity, that dehumidifier kicks on immediately.
[43:43.390 --> 43:47.650]  If it gets to 45%, the humidifier comes on immediately.
[43:47.650 --> 43:51.270]  I don't get out of that 10 degree range, and it stays pretty close with both of those
[43:51.270 --> 43:52.890]  machines and they're fighting each other.
[43:52.890 --> 43:55.450]  They pretty much just stay on all the time.
[43:55.450 --> 43:57.190]  I've got these buds.
[43:57.190 --> 43:58.190]  They are in containers.
[43:58.190 --> 44:02.810]  They have not been trimmed yet, and they still need to be burped on a daily basis.
[44:02.810 --> 44:06.810]  The first thing the dry and cure manager or the trim team manager should do when they
[44:06.810 --> 44:12.130]  get to the grow is pop open these bends and see what type of situation you've got.
[44:12.130 --> 44:15.890]  They should be getting drier and more smokable, and they should start smelling more like dank
[44:15.890 --> 44:17.550]  cannabis every day.
[44:17.550 --> 44:22.470]  That fresh green wet smell should be going away, but you're going to have to pop them
[44:22.470 --> 44:26.270]  every day and pay attention to how long they need to be opened.
[44:26.270 --> 44:29.870]  Like I said, that first day, you're going to get four to six hours.
[44:29.870 --> 44:31.950]  Maybe the second day, four to six hours.
[44:31.950 --> 44:33.630]  Maybe the third day, four hours.
[44:33.630 --> 44:35.190]  Maybe the fourth day, three hours.
[44:35.190 --> 44:38.590]  Then maybe you're just going to have to pop them open for an hour every day and see what's
[44:38.590 --> 44:40.510]  going on and check it out.
[44:40.510 --> 44:43.430]  Eventually you won't have to open them anymore.
[44:43.430 --> 44:48.350]  Once you've gotten them to about 65% humidity inside the container consistently, you don't
[44:48.350 --> 44:49.390]  have to burp it.
[44:49.390 --> 44:51.430]  That is cured where you want it.
[44:51.430 --> 44:56.430]  It's also in that room with 50% humidity, so it's going to stay about 50% humidity and
[44:56.430 --> 44:58.550]  it won't get less than that.
[44:58.550 --> 45:03.390]  The containers hold moisture in there, so it's going to stay above 50%, trust me.
[45:03.390 --> 45:07.630]  While you're drying and curing inside those bends, be sure to burp the bends every day
[45:07.630 --> 45:12.470]  and rotate the buds to prevent mold and funky aromas until they get dry enough to leave
[45:12.470 --> 45:13.470]  alone.
[45:13.470 --> 45:17.150]  Don't be afraid to take the buds and pick them up right outside of the container and
[45:17.150 --> 45:20.910]  flip them over and set them back in so all the buds that were on the bottom are now on
[45:20.910 --> 45:21.910]  the top.
[45:21.910 --> 45:27.230]  You can do that once or twice a day if you feel like you need to if they are really wet.
[45:27.230 --> 45:30.810]  Something I want to keep stressing is if they are too moist, don't be afraid to leave the
[45:30.810 --> 45:35.710]  lid off the containers until the buds are nice and dry and you feel comfortable closing
[45:35.710 --> 45:38.870]  them up and you're sure there's not going to get any mold in there.
[45:39.430 --> 45:43.510]  If you leave it closed for too long or you bend these buds too early, you're going to
[45:43.510 --> 45:48.530]  create an ammonia-type, funky, terrible smell inside your buds.
[45:48.530 --> 45:52.190]  They're not going to burn well, they're going to taste terrible, they're going to smell
[45:52.190 --> 45:55.790]  funky and it's not going to be desirable and you're not going to be able to sell it at
[45:55.790 --> 45:58.910]  your dispensary or however you plan on selling it.
[45:58.910 --> 46:03.130]  One problem you may run into if you leave it closed too long is funky aromas.
[46:03.130 --> 46:06.190]  The only thing you can do to fix that is try to air it out.
[46:06.190 --> 46:10.750]  Just leave it open, let it dry, try to let that smell go away and it's probably not going
[46:10.750 --> 46:13.470]  to, you've probably gone too long.
[46:13.470 --> 46:17.310]  Make sure not to seal it up for too long and make sure not to seal it up when it's too
[46:17.310 --> 46:18.790]  moist.
[46:18.790 --> 46:21.950]  Another problem you could run into during the drying and curing process is the buds
[46:21.950 --> 46:24.030]  could get too dry.
[46:24.030 --> 46:29.350]  If your buds get too dry in those containers, a trick you can do is to go pull a few leaves
[46:29.350 --> 46:32.230]  from your growing plants.
[46:32.230 --> 46:35.870]  If you've got a flower room, you probably need to defoliate a little bit and pull some
[46:36.550 --> 46:38.750]  leaves off those flowering plants anyway.
[46:38.750 --> 46:44.950]  Go get, I would say four to six large leaves per Rubbermaid container is more than enough
[46:44.950 --> 46:49.110]  to rehydrate some semi-dry buds in one of those containers.
[46:49.110 --> 46:53.670]  We tried to put too much in there and it made it really wet really quickly.
[46:53.670 --> 46:58.230]  Four to six leaves is more than enough to re-moisten an entire Rubbermaid container
[46:58.230 --> 47:00.990]  if you left it open just a little bit too long.
[47:00.990 --> 47:04.590]  If you got it down into that Colorado crunch zone, then you've done fucked up and you might
[47:04.590 --> 47:05.590]  not be able to fix it.
[47:05.790 --> 47:08.590]  We'll talk about that a little bit later in the episode.
[47:08.590 --> 47:12.950]  If you didn't go too far, just grab four or five, maybe six leaves, throw them in the
[47:12.950 --> 47:16.950]  container and seal it up for just a few hours, then go check on it.
[47:16.950 --> 47:20.790]  That moisture will reconstitute the buds and give you a second chance.
[47:20.790 --> 47:25.510]  I would not recommend using anything other than cannabis leaves, maybe Boveda packs,
[47:25.510 --> 47:27.510]  Boveda packs, however you like to say it.
[47:27.510 --> 47:31.430]  The Boveda packs come in 62% humidity.
[47:31.430 --> 47:34.950]  You can use those if you'd like, although I do not prefer them myself.
[47:34.990 --> 47:38.630]  I think they make a weird flavor in my cannabis buds.
[47:38.630 --> 47:42.310]  I think that using the leaves of the same plant is the best idea.
[47:42.310 --> 47:47.950]  All right, so that is basically the commercial grow version of drying and curing your cannabis
[47:47.950 --> 47:50.990]  plants on a large scale.
[47:50.990 --> 47:55.190]  Now I'm going to take a giant dab and when we get back, we will talk about drying and
[47:55.190 --> 47:59.190]  curing your cannabis on a smaller scale for the home grower.
[48:16.880 --> 48:18.040]  All right, podcast world.
[48:18.080 --> 48:21.240]  Let's get back into this dry and cure episode.
[48:21.240 --> 48:25.720]  The home grow or the connoisseur version of drying and curing your final product is a
[48:25.720 --> 48:29.520]  little bit different than the commercial grow version, but it's basically the same idea.
[48:29.520 --> 48:31.720]  We want to slow down the drying process.
[48:31.720 --> 48:33.880]  We want to get those buds to feel nice and sticky.
[48:33.880 --> 48:36.200]  We want them to smell nice and sweet.
[48:36.200 --> 48:38.520]  We want them to burn nice and smooth.
[48:38.520 --> 48:44.520]  This is how I would dry and cure my product in a small connoisseur batch.
[48:44.520 --> 48:49.120]  In a smaller grow, a home grow or a boutique grow, or maybe something I was going to enter
[48:49.120 --> 48:55.440]  into a competition, if this was going into a cup, this is how I would cure my product.
[48:55.440 --> 49:00.040]  The main difference is that I would not be using the gigantic Rubbermaid containers.
[49:00.040 --> 49:04.160]  I would use quart size, wide mouth glass jars.
[49:04.160 --> 49:05.760]  I don't want to use bigger jars.
[49:05.760 --> 49:08.560]  I feel like maybe too much moisture gets stuck in there.
[49:08.560 --> 49:11.920]  You have the same conditions that you create in those Rubbermaid containers.
[49:11.920 --> 49:14.400]  I like the smaller, more focused jars.
[49:14.440 --> 49:18.160]  Another note before we get too far, make sure you label each jar.
[49:18.160 --> 49:22.440]  If you're working with more than one strain, label the jars, not the lids.
[49:22.440 --> 49:23.760]  Lids are interchangeable.
[49:23.760 --> 49:25.400]  Be careful with this, please.
[49:25.400 --> 49:30.920]  If you're working with different phenotypes, label the jar, whatever, Arise Phenotype 2,
[49:30.920 --> 49:32.560]  Arise Phenotype 3.
[49:32.560 --> 49:36.120]  If you're running a pack of seeds or whatever, label the jars so that you know what you're
[49:36.120 --> 49:38.400]  working with.
[49:38.400 --> 49:42.280]  Basically everything up to the point of the sticks snapping is the same.
[49:42.280 --> 49:43.960]  We're waiting for the sticks to snap.
[49:43.960 --> 49:49.440]  Once the sticks snap, that's when we can start the jar curing process.
[49:49.440 --> 49:54.320]  For jar tech, I would take the snappy sticks and chop off every bud into a bucket.
[49:54.320 --> 49:58.480]  Just get all those buds off the sticks, into the bucket, throw those sticks away, get rid
[49:58.480 --> 50:01.640]  of them, do whatever you do with them, compost them, shred them up, toss them.
[50:01.640 --> 50:02.640]  Those are done.
[50:02.640 --> 50:04.200]  Then, I hand trim the buds.
[50:04.200 --> 50:06.800]  I'll do another episode all about hand trimming the buds.
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.240]  I don't like trim machines and I don't like wet trim, but I'll talk about that in the
[50:11.240 --> 50:13.000]  trimming episode that is coming up.
[50:13.040 --> 50:14.040]  I trim the buds.
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.240]  They should be dry enough by now to knock off most of the leaves with your thumbs and
[50:18.240 --> 50:19.240]  thumbnails.
[50:19.240 --> 50:24.320]  Trim them up pretty closely with your thumb, then put the trimmed buds into the glass jars
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.280]  that we talked about, the wide-mouth quart-sized mason jars.
[50:28.280 --> 50:32.240]  Fill those jars about 75% to 90% full.
[50:32.240 --> 50:37.440]  If your buds are fluffier, if your buds are bigger, you're only going to be able to get
[50:37.440 --> 50:39.880]  75% in there because of all the air space.
[50:39.880 --> 50:40.880]  I get it.
[50:40.880 --> 50:41.880]  It makes sense.
[50:41.880 --> 50:46.320]  If you've got smaller buds, you can put up to 90% in there, but do not press them down
[50:46.320 --> 50:49.800]  into the jar and don't overpack them and don't squish them in.
[50:49.800 --> 50:52.920]  You just want them lightly sitting in there.
[50:52.920 --> 50:56.000]  Once the jar is full, I add the lid and I set a timer.
[50:56.000 --> 51:02.000]  I like to check my buds about four hours after being sealed up for the first time.
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.120]  This first check lets me see how much moisture is trapped in my buds.
[51:05.120 --> 51:10.240]  If the inside of the jar is extremely humid, I'll just leave that lid off for an hour or
[51:10.240 --> 51:11.240]  more.
[51:11.600 --> 51:15.840]  A year ago, we were talking about four to six, maybe eight hours, maybe even 10 hours.
[51:15.840 --> 51:21.000]  Those are much larger plants, much larger batches, and much larger containers.
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  There is much more moisture in there.
[51:23.000 --> 51:28.360]  For these smaller jars, I only want to leave it off for a little bit at a time.
[51:28.360 --> 51:32.880]  These smaller batches can get away from you quite quickly, so pay more attention.
[51:32.880 --> 51:33.880]  Open it up.
[51:33.880 --> 51:34.880]  See how humid it is.
[51:34.880 --> 51:38.640]  If it's really humid and really squishy, you're going to want to leave it open for an hour,
[51:38.640 --> 51:39.820]  maybe a little bit more.
[51:39.820 --> 51:42.140]  Just keep checking on it and do not forget about it.
[51:42.140 --> 51:43.140]  Set another timer.
[51:43.140 --> 51:48.580]  If the humidity has not made the buds squishy again, I'll leave the jar open for only 15
[51:48.580 --> 51:53.340]  to 30 minutes to let the moisture out and that old funky air out of the jar.
[51:53.340 --> 51:55.780]  Then it'll refresh with fresh air in there.
[51:55.780 --> 51:59.740]  Then I'll reseal the jar and let it sit for another four to six hours.
[51:59.740 --> 52:01.580]  I set a timer for this.
[52:01.580 --> 52:06.300]  Then in four to six hours, I pop that jar and I gently stir the buds around and check
[52:06.300 --> 52:09.020]  the aroma that comes out of there.
[52:09.020 --> 52:16.220]  What I'm looking for when I smell is an aroma of ammonia or funk.
[52:16.220 --> 52:17.220]  You'll notice it.
[52:17.220 --> 52:20.220]  Your nose will crinkle up and your eyes will make a weird squint and you'll go, fuck, I
[52:20.220 --> 52:21.220]  fucked up.
[52:21.220 --> 52:22.700]  I'm looking for that aroma.
[52:22.700 --> 52:24.300]  I'm hoping that's not present.
[52:24.300 --> 52:25.300]  It shouldn't be.
[52:25.300 --> 52:28.820]  Also, I'm looking to see if it smells less wet.
[52:28.820 --> 52:34.500]  Has it gone from that wet, juicy hay smell to more of that cured chronic smell that I'm
[52:34.500 --> 52:35.500]  looking for?
[52:35.500 --> 52:38.820]  Because it'll start doing it quickly and then it will improve over time.
[52:39.620 --> 52:40.620]  I'm cracking the jar open.
[52:40.620 --> 52:43.500]  I'm looking to see how much humidity is in there.
[52:43.500 --> 52:44.980]  I stir them around.
[52:44.980 --> 52:50.340]  If the buds seem damp or extra spongy at this point, I'll dump them out of the jar and let
[52:50.340 --> 52:54.000]  them sit for a few minutes until that excess moisture evaporates.
[52:54.000 --> 52:57.180]  You don't want the buds super soggy and sealed in a jar.
[52:57.180 --> 52:59.860]  You don't want the buds super wet and pressed together in a jar.
[52:59.860 --> 53:04.660]  If they still feel wet and spongy on the outside, I'll dump them out and let them sit out for
[53:04.660 --> 53:07.060]  a few minutes until they feel dry on the outside.
[53:07.660 --> 53:10.740]  When you squeeze them, they're mushy still a little bit.
[53:10.740 --> 53:13.700]  You just want them dry on the outside, wet on the inside is what you're going for at
[53:13.700 --> 53:14.700]  this point.
[53:14.700 --> 53:18.980]  If the buds are sticking together, then I dump them out completely and let them dry
[53:18.980 --> 53:21.140]  more before putting them back in.
[53:21.140 --> 53:24.220]  Now we want a little bit of moisture in these buds.
[53:24.220 --> 53:28.380]  The little bit of moisture is going to make the drying and curing process happen, but
[53:28.380 --> 53:32.180]  we don't want enough moisture to cause mold and funk.
[53:32.180 --> 53:36.500]  We burp the jar about every four hours to make sure we don't seal too much water in
[53:36.500 --> 53:38.360]  the jar for too long.
[53:38.360 --> 53:42.500]  We let some of the curing process happen by opening the jar, letting that old gas out
[53:42.500 --> 53:46.420]  that contains the chlorophyll, that contains the sugars, that gas evaporates out of the
[53:46.420 --> 53:47.420]  jar.
[53:47.420 --> 53:49.460]  We replace it with fresh air, we seal it back up.
[53:49.460 --> 53:52.300]  Then when we seal it, it's allowed to restart the curing process.
[53:52.300 --> 53:57.260]  It'll start deteriorating and eating up more of that chlorophyll, more of those excess
[53:57.260 --> 54:01.460]  minerals and sugars inside of there, and they will start evaporating out of your buds.
[54:01.460 --> 54:03.060]  You'll get them out.
[54:03.060 --> 54:04.860]  Let's get back on track here.
[54:04.860 --> 54:09.580]  After the first couple of days, you can slowly increase your burp intervals as the buds get
[54:09.580 --> 54:10.580]  drier.
[54:10.580 --> 54:14.900]  You may only need to open these jars up every six to eight hours after a little bit.
[54:14.900 --> 54:18.260]  The time that you leave them open will also decrease.
[54:18.260 --> 54:21.300]  Maybe after a few days, you pop it open every eight hours.
[54:21.300 --> 54:24.020]  Maybe you pop it open right before you go to work, you leave it open while you're brushing
[54:24.020 --> 54:26.780]  your teeth and getting your shoes on, and then you close it up and you leave.
[54:26.780 --> 54:28.460]  You come back from work and then you pop it open.
[54:28.460 --> 54:30.260]  It's probably been 10 hours by now.
[54:30.260 --> 54:33.220]  Pop it open again, stir the buds around, make sure nothing's gone funky.
[54:33.220 --> 54:36.460]  If nothing's gone funky, just leave it open for five minutes.
[54:36.460 --> 54:39.420]  Let that air exchange in there, seal it right back up.
[54:39.420 --> 54:42.260]  Then you can go 10 hours and you know you're safe at 10 hours.
[54:42.260 --> 54:43.580]  See what happens at 11 hours.
[54:43.580 --> 54:44.820]  See what happens at 12 hours.
[54:44.820 --> 54:46.900]  Just start stretching it every day.
[54:46.900 --> 54:51.100]  By the end of two weeks, you'll just be popping these jars open once a day.
[54:51.100 --> 54:54.220]  You'll check it out, you'll give it a good smell, and you'll say, that is so close, and
[54:54.220 --> 54:55.780]  then you can close it back up.
[54:55.780 --> 55:01.420]  By the end of two weeks, these buds will be beautifully, beautifully cured.
[55:01.420 --> 55:07.340]  The buds should be sticky on the outside and spongy, but not dry and crumbly.
[55:07.340 --> 55:10.460]  They should almost have a little bit of squeeze, a little bit of give to them, and then stick
[55:10.460 --> 55:11.460]  to your fingers.
[55:11.460 --> 55:16.860]  They shouldn't fall apart and just crumble up like a lot of the Colorado dispensary bud
[55:16.860 --> 55:18.060]  does unfortunately.
[55:18.060 --> 55:21.780]  The reason for that, you guys, is because it's sitting on the shelf out there all day.
[55:21.780 --> 55:24.660]  They're opening up those jars and showing it to you all day.
[55:24.660 --> 55:26.540]  That stuff is just getting dry.
[55:26.540 --> 55:28.100]  That's the problem with the Colorado Crunch.
[55:28.100 --> 55:29.260]  I apologize for that.
[55:29.260 --> 55:33.060]  The growers work hard to get it proper, and then it's sent to the dispensary and left
[55:33.060 --> 55:37.820]  in those jars, and the bud tenders don't do us justice, so I apologize.
[55:37.820 --> 55:40.700]  On day one, I chop the buds off the sticks and I trim them up.
[55:40.700 --> 55:43.180]  Then I fill the jars about 90% full.
[55:43.180 --> 55:44.460]  Then I seal the jar.
[55:44.460 --> 55:46.740]  I check the jar in about four hours.
[55:46.740 --> 55:50.380]  I open it long enough for the excess moisture to come out of the jar.
[55:50.380 --> 55:51.500]  That could be a little while.
[55:51.500 --> 55:53.620]  That could be a short amount of time.
[55:53.620 --> 55:56.980]  It kind of depends on how wet the buds were when you jarred them up.
[55:56.980 --> 55:58.660]  Then I check it again in about four hours.
[55:58.660 --> 56:01.700]  I shuffle the buds if I feel that's necessary.
[56:01.700 --> 56:03.940]  It's likely necessary.
[56:03.940 --> 56:07.580]  Then I check again in four to six hours and leave open as necessary.
[56:07.580 --> 56:10.220]  If they're getting too sticky again, I'll dump them out.
[56:10.220 --> 56:12.940]  You'll want to check as soon as you wake up the next day.
[56:12.940 --> 56:15.900]  The burp process will slow down over the next few days.
[56:15.900 --> 56:20.180]  You want it to take as long as possible without allowing mildew to develop.
[56:20.180 --> 56:21.260]  You want to slow it down.
[56:21.260 --> 56:22.620]  The longer it takes, the better.
[56:22.620 --> 56:26.800]  The more time that it takes for that moisture to come out, the more opportunity you have
[56:26.800 --> 56:29.080]  for chlorophyll to be removed.
[56:29.080 --> 56:33.840]  The only thing to worry about, very similarly to the Rubbermaid technique, is trapping too
[56:33.840 --> 56:40.640]  much moisture in your containers for too long and causing yourself mildew or funky flavors.
[56:40.640 --> 56:44.540]  If you locked your buds up in these jars long enough to where you got like white moldy webbing
[56:44.540 --> 56:48.320]  growing on there and it looks like some cotton coming out, you fucked up and didn't pay any
[56:48.320 --> 56:50.660]  attention, throw that away.
[56:50.660 --> 56:54.400]  If your jar is starting to get an ammonia smell, you've sealed it up too long, you've
[56:54.400 --> 56:57.480]  got to open it more frequently and longer next time.
[56:57.480 --> 56:59.400]  You may be able to save it, but it's unlikely.
[56:59.400 --> 57:02.840]  The only thing you can do is leave it open and let it dry out and hopefully that smell
[57:02.840 --> 57:04.400]  will go away.
[57:04.400 --> 57:07.280]  So don't leave it closed too long.
[57:07.280 --> 57:08.560]  Don't let mildew happen.
[57:08.560 --> 57:10.000]  Don't let that funky smell happen.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.120]  Once you're past the first few days, you'll kind of be out of the mildew danger zone,
[57:14.120 --> 57:15.800]  but still be careful.
[57:15.800 --> 57:21.200]  Also keep your jars in a cool, dark place while you're curing your buds, but also don't
[57:21.200 --> 57:24.560]  leave them somewhere where you're going to forget about them.
[57:24.560 --> 57:30.000]  Also here in Colorado, I'm running a swamp cooler in the main portion, the living area
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.700]  of my house.
[57:31.700 --> 57:34.380]  Don't go dump your buds on the table near the swamp cooler.
[57:34.380 --> 57:35.980]  This is not going to do you any good.
[57:35.980 --> 57:39.040]  This is going to reconstitute them and make them wetter.
[57:39.040 --> 57:40.040]  Think about wetter.
[57:40.040 --> 57:41.320]  Is that a word?
[57:41.320 --> 57:45.400]  Anyway, think about the environment where you were drying and curing your products.
[57:45.400 --> 57:49.280]  If you're going to dump them out on the table and an attempt to get them more dry, make
[57:49.280 --> 57:53.760]  sure that the room is drier than the bud or it's not going to work.
[57:53.760 --> 57:55.360]  Just keep that kind of stuff in mind, you guys.
[57:55.360 --> 57:56.420]  Think about your environment.
[57:56.420 --> 57:58.100]  Think about your products.
[57:58.100 --> 58:02.180]  So I feel like we've got a basic understanding of how to cure our buds.
[58:02.180 --> 58:08.680]  Now let's get into the technical talk about why we do it and what's technically happening.
[58:08.680 --> 58:13.080]  So curing your buds properly makes your buds burn and smoke smoothly, and it also brings
[58:13.080 --> 58:15.880]  out the best flavors and aromas.
[58:15.880 --> 58:19.560]  So drying and curing will also increase your potency.
[58:19.560 --> 58:20.560]  Now why?
[58:20.560 --> 58:21.560]  Why does that happen?
[58:21.560 --> 58:23.560]  Because your buds contain chlorophyll.
[58:23.560 --> 58:29.000]  Chlorophyll is what gives your buds that harsh smoke and hay-like flavor, that burn-your-throat
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.560]  kind of funky flavor.
[58:30.560 --> 58:31.860]  That's from too much chlorophyll.
[58:31.860 --> 58:34.080]  That's from excess minerals in the plant.
[58:34.080 --> 58:38.980]  That could also be from an improper flush, but it's usually from an improper cure.
[58:38.980 --> 58:43.900]  So curing the buds will remove chlorophyll and increase your potency at the same time.
[58:43.920 --> 58:48.380]  The only way to remove chlorophyll is by turning it into a gas.
[58:48.380 --> 58:52.580]  Sealing our moist buds in a jar creates an environment that will break down the chlorophyll
[58:52.580 --> 58:54.420]  and turn it into a gas.
[58:54.420 --> 59:00.300]  Darkness, moisture, and oxygen will create a bacteria within the jar.
[59:00.300 --> 59:04.740]  That bacteria will break down the sugars and leftover minerals created by the decomposition
[59:04.740 --> 59:09.640]  of the chlorophyll, and it will turn into a vapor that can escape the jar when you pop
[59:09.640 --> 59:10.640]  it open.
[59:10.640 --> 59:13.540]  That was what I was talking about earlier when I said we pop open the jar and let the
[59:13.540 --> 59:15.060]  chemical reaction happen.
[59:15.060 --> 59:17.900]  Now this process is going to make your bud burn smoother.
[59:17.900 --> 59:19.800]  It's going to make it taste better.
[59:19.800 --> 59:24.420]  It's going to bring out the proper aromas, the proper terpene profile that you're looking
[59:24.420 --> 59:30.660]  for, and it's also going to increase the overall potency of your finished product.
[59:30.660 --> 59:35.300]  Now if you really want to nerd out and dial this in and create a connoisseur product,
[59:35.300 --> 59:39.040]  find yourself a hygrometer that fits inside of your mason jar.
[59:39.040 --> 59:41.880]  There are a couple available that fit right inside the mason jar.
[59:41.880 --> 59:44.840]  You can press it up to the front of the jar to where you can read the display without
[59:44.840 --> 59:46.600]  opening the jar.
[59:46.600 --> 59:51.540]  Find yourself hygrometers that will fit in the jar, and here are some suggestions on
[59:51.540 --> 59:56.280]  when to open and close your jars and how to dial them in perfectly.
[59:56.280 --> 01:00:02.200]  If your buds feel wet or if they are above 70% humidity, if the little display on that
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:08.200]  hygrometer inside of your jar reads above 70% humidity, you need to dump those buds
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:15.040]  out of the jar and let them dry until they get to 65 to 70% humidity.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.360]  When you dump them out and you leave them somewhere that's not by the fan, that's not
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:21.840]  by the swamp cooler, that's not by the air conditioner, that's not by something that's
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.360]  going to drastically affect the rate of their drying, don't forget about them.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.360]  Set a timer and go find them.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.960]  Some of you are a little obsessive.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.520]  You're definitely not going to forget.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.720]  Some of you are going to take a couple of dabs and go play Fortnite and your buds are
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.180]  going to dry up to shit.
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.080]  Don't let that happen, you guys.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.280]  If they are too humid, dump them out.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.480]  Let them dry out a little bit.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.440]  Get them down to 65 to 70% humidity.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.760]  Now if your buds feel moist to the touch, if they're sticky and wet to the outside of
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:56.240]  the buds and the display reads 65 to 70% humidity, pop the lid off of that jar for 15 to 30 minutes
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.840]  and let a little moisture evaporate out.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:04.360]  If you think they need longer than 15 to 30 minutes, let them go longer, but like I said,
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.840]  start playing Fortnite and start building shit and shooting people and forget about
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.480]  them because you don't want them to get too crunchy.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:16.480]  So 15 to 30, maybe 45 minutes, maybe an hour, seal them back up, set yourself a timer to
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.520]  remember to check on them in a little bit, and now you can go play Fortnite and relax.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:24.320]  Now your goal is 60 to 65% humidity.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:30.900]  You want that hygrometer to read between 60 and 65% humidity and you want them dry but
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:31.900]  not crunchy.
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:36.580]  They're going to feel squishy and sticky hopefully, but they're not wet.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.340]  You just want them dry but not crunchy.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:43.100]  You might need to let your buds sit out for a little bit before you roll a joint if it's
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.460]  cured perfectly.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:47.160]  The display will say 60 to 65%.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.360]  You may need to take a couple of buds out of there and set them, I just set them right
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.300]  here on the front of my computer if I'm going to roll one, it's a little warmer right there,
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.300]  just let them chill.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.100]  They're not like in the path of the fan or anything.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.380]  Just let them chill right here.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.620]  That's what I'm going to roll a joint within a few minutes and just let them sit there
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:01.700]  just for a little bit.
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.300]  Next maybe if I'm going to go to lunch and come back and smoke a joint, I'll set them
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.980]  out right before I go to lunch.
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.500]  And then you go to lunch and then you come back and then they grind up nice and fine
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.580]  and they're still sticky, they're still juicy.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.060]  And then your joint burns super smoothly.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:18.220]  And if your joint's not burning super smooth, then you probably have too much moisture in
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:22.060]  there and you got to let it dry and cure just a little bit longer.
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:27.140]  Now if you hit that 55% or lower mark, you're entering what I call the Colorado crunch area
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:30.540]  and your buds are going to burn too fast and you're also losing weight.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:34.140]  If you're working with more than a quarter pound there and you're drying it up, you risk
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:37.940]  losing a quarter of an ounce or whatever, depends on how much you let it dry.
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:43.340]  So if your buds get too dry, don't add anything funky to rehydrate them.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:49.020]  The only thing I would use are fresh cannabis leaves and a little bit goes a long way.
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:53.180]  So take them out when the moisture comes back and don't let those leaves mold up in there
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.620]  and fuck up your crop.
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.220]  Check on them frequently.
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:01.660]  If you put wet leaves inside of either your curing jars or your packs or your fucking
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:06.260]  turkey bags, however you do it, make sure you take them out and don't leave them for
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.260]  too long.
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.060]  Check on them after an hour.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.140]  One hour is more than enough.
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.340]  Go check on it.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.420]  Set yourself a timer.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:16.740]  Don't get stuck doing an Instagram live video and forget to check on your buds.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.740]  All right.
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:21.940]  So it's going to take a little bit for your hygrometer to measure the humidity in the
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:27.020]  jar, but it's going to get you a pretty good idea of when to open and close those jars.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:30.060]  And it's going to give you some actual data to go by.
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.900]  You'll be able to squeeze those buds and feel how wet they are.
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.620]  And you'll be able to compare that number or that moisture to the number on the hygrometer
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:39.300]  and you'll go, oh, that's what 65% feels like.
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.200]  That's what Jeff's trying to get me to.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.120]  So that gives you something to work with.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.940]  It's a little bit of a cheater.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:48.420]  But if you're using one hygrometer, you're going to have to seal it into the jar for
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:51.420]  a few minutes and wait for it to get to where it needs to be.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.980]  Now, if it's jumping real fast, go ahead and pull it out.
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:54.980]  Leave that jar open.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.820]  That means it's really humid in there and that you're just going to seal it up and cause
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:58.820]  problems.
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:03:59.820]  All right.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.980]  So we've got a little tiny hygrometer in our jars.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:02.980]  We're watching the numbers.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:08.620]  We're trying to get ourselves to 60 to 65% humidity inside of those jars.
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.300]  Make sure you don't forget about your buds.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.220]  Make sure you don't get that funky aroma in there.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:14.580]  Make sure it doesn't smell like ammonia and mildew.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.120]  Make sure you don't ruin it.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.460]  You should be paying attention to the number on the hygrometer and then pulling some buds
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:24.260]  out and seeing what they feel like so that you know what 50, what 60, what 70, what 80%
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.260]  humidity.
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.260]  If you get to 80, you fucked up.
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:29.620]  But so that you know what the percentage of humidity feels like inside these jars, what
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:32.180]  the bud feels like, this will give you a really good idea.
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:37.700]  Start paying attention to that stuff and you will get ahead of the drying and curing game.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:42.240]  Now once you've gotten your buds dried and cured to 55 to 65% humidity and you don't
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.340]  see any fluctuation inside that jar on the hygrometer, you only need to crack them open
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.540]  to check on them or pull out some buds to smoke.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.740]  You don't need to keep popping those jars open.
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.060]  They're going to get too dry if you do that.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:56.780]  So you can trap the moisture in there, leave it right at that point, and your bud will
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:59.220]  be perfectly cured for whenever you need it.
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:03.100]  Now I've said before that I don't like the Boveda packs, but they work if you do fuck
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.100]  up.
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:08.660]  The Boveda packs I would buy are the 62% and you can just drop them right inside your jar.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:11.900]  It'll help reconstitute that package or that jar.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:15.980]  And then sometimes I feel like they leave kind of a watery flavor on the buds, but I
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:21.220]  guess I'd rather have a properly cured bud that has that aroma than some Colorado crunch
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:24.220]  that's just going to burn up when I light my joint at the show.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.780]  So ladies and gentlemen, that is my dry and cure episode.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.100]  I want to thank you guys for listening.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.580]  If you have questions, please send them to me.
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:35.020]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:39.780]  I would love to continue the conversation and clear up anything I left out for you.
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:40.780]  Just let me know.
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:44.940]  Also, this is a good time for me to recommend my Patreon campaign.
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:49.820]  Patreon is a website that gives you as a podcast listener the opportunity to contribute
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.580]  financially to my podcasting efforts.
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:55.540]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks, if you feel like you had
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:06:00.620]  some fun, if you feel like you learned something, I would encourage you to go to patreon.com
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:04.820]  slash growfromyourheart and sign up for my Patreon campaign.
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:09.380]  I know that not everybody is able to financially contribute to the show.
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:12.180]  I will always keep this show free for everybody.
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.220]  I want everybody to be able to hear my message.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:17.220]  I want everybody to be able to improve their garden.
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:19.180]  I want everybody to have better medicine.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.860]  I want better cannabis worldwide.
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.580]  I'm going to do my part for free.
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.740]  There are people who would like to contribute.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.660]  There are people that feel like they can help out.
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.100]  I would appreciate that help.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.460]  What I do with that funding is I pay for my website.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:35.580]  I actually bought a MacBook, so I need to pay for the MacBook.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:38.860]  I actually buy these little microphone covers so that when Granny and Giddy are on, they
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:42.700]  don't have to spit into these same microphone covers over and over again.
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:45.900]  There are things like that that do need to be covered, and I do appreciate the support.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:47.220]  You guys, I'm not begging.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:50.340]  If you don't know that it's an option, you don't know how you can help out.
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:54.220]  I do appreciate everybody that has helped out with the Patreon campaign.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.700]  It blows my mind every month to see that come in.
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.700]  Thank you.
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.100]  Also, you guys, thanks for listening to the podcast.
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.180]  Just thanks for putting your trust in me.
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.380]  Thanks for believing in me.
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:07.940]  You guys are risking your gardens on my advice, and that means a lot to me, so thank you.
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:10.540]  You guys, I'm going to start wrapping up this podcast.
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.020]  I want to thank you again for listening to the show.
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.860]  Thanks for hanging out for the Dry and Cure episode.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.460]  I hope you learned a lot.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:20.100]  I will have a trimming episode coming up, and then we're going to talk about restarting
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:21.100]  the garden.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.080]  I've got a bunch of great plans for the podcast.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.220]  Thanks for hanging out.
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:25.300]  Thanks for all the great emails.

[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.100]  It is really encouraging.

[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:44.100]  I usually end these episodes by giving a shout out to one specific person, but on this episode,
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.220]  I want to give a shout out to everybody who is listening.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:51.620]  If you hear this, big shout out, high five, fist bump, however you do it, thank you.
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:52.620]  Shout out to you.
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:57.220]  And ladies and gentlemen, until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:36.640]  Hey, welcome to the show podcast world.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.480]  It is time for episode 393 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:43.480]  This episode is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.760]  If you're looking for new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:53.480]  you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.720]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:02.400]  I just took a ridiculous dab of Mandarin Sunset from Contraband Extracts, available at a cut
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.400]  above in Colorado Springs.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.720]  This concentrate has a great aroma and flavor.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.480]  It is sweet, orange, and candy with a hint of pepper and spice at the back end, and the
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.840]  high is tremendous.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.380]  It goes straight to my head.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:15.880]  It goes straight behind my eyes.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.080]  It kind of makes it hard to think.
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.480]  It makes it hard to pay attention, but that is exactly what I'm looking for in a concentrate.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.280]  So shout out to our friends at Contraband Extracts, and a big shout out to everyone
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.960]  at A Cut Above.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.080]  If you have been following along with the podcast, you know I have been doing a long
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.120]  series of grow lessons.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.960]  This is going to be another grow lesson.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:38.080]  However, this is going to be a reposted episode.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.380]  A while back, I did an episode about trimming our freshly harvested cannabis.
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:45.720]  It was originally posted as episode 327.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:50.960]  It falls right in line with our grow lessons, so I'm going to repost it as episode 393.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.360]  I hope everybody enjoys this repost.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's jump right in to trimming our freshly harvested cannabis.
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:00.600]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.600]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.400]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.400]  That's right.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.440]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.440]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the current
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.960]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.960]  I'm your host.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:20.960]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.440]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:28.400]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.760]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.

[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:44.280]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.480]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.400]  It's time for episode 327 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.400]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.720]  You know I like to start the episode off by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:05.200]  Today, I'm taking dabs of this New York City Diesel Ambrosia Batter from Apothecary Farms.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.600]  I'm giving it a nice smell right now.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.960]  This stuff smells like diesel fuel with a little bit of lemons, maybe a hint of oranges,
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.080]  and then there's kind of a sweet tart sort of smell on top of it that I really enjoy.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:21.120]  One thing about the New York City Diesel Ambrosia Batter here that I'm smoking on, my eyes really
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.200]  don't get red when I smoke.
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.080]  I can smoke and I don't get red-eyed, but when I take one dab of this New York City
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.760]  Diesel, my eyes go fully bloodshot red.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.160]  I'm not sure what does it, but I get super red.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:34.280]  I get super head high from it, and I really enjoy it.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:39.200]  If that weren't enough, I've been adding this Sour Amnesia High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.160]  Extract into the mix.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.120]  It just adds a really nice ... It's like turbocharging my dab.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.120]  It is really nice.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.440]  It really adds the lung expansion and the flavor from the New York City Diesel.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:52.480]  Then you put the High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum Extract on top, and it really makes it like
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.600]  a turbocharged dab.
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.080]  I'm in the mood for a podcast, you guys.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.080]  I feel super rambly.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.880]  I feel like I got a lot of energy.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.580]  Let's get into a podcast.
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:04.600]  This episode is going to be all about trimming your cannabis plants.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.600]  That's right.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.600]  We've learned how to tell when the plants are ripe.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.120]  We've learned how to cut them down.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.200]  We've learned how to harvest them.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.360]  We learned how to hang them until they're ready to snap.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.360]  We know pretty well how to dry and cure.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.920]  Let's talk about trimming our plants.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.240]  There are two different ways you can trim.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.400]  There's wet trim, and there is dry trim.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.760]  I definitely prefer dry trim.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.400]  You're going to say, why is dry trim better?
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:31.580]  I think dry trim is better because it's less sticky, and it's much easier to work with.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.280]  It's also less work.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.640]  The leaves are dry.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.640]  Those leaves are going to fall off.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.840]  All you have to do is just brush them with your thumb, maybe touch them with the scissors,
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.560]  and those brittle leaves will come right off of there.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.280]  The buds have dried and tightened up.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.920]  It's a little more obvious for a new trimmer what to take off.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.120]  You just want to take off that fluffy outside shit.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.120]  It's a little less work.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.240]  It's less sticky.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:55.560]  There's also less chance to ruin your buds by improperly storing them.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.900]  A lot of people, once the buds are trimmed, if they wet trim, they like to just shove
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.960]  them into a container or a package.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.880]  Then those wet buds go into a container, and that's when they get ruined.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.160]  We're not even going to let that happen.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.720]  We're going to let the buds dry.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:08.760]  Then we're going to trim them.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.640]  Then we'll put them in a container.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:13.160]  A lot of people have listened to the dry and curing episode.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:17.080]  You may be trimming these buds before they go into the jar for cure.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.960]  You may be trimming these buds after they've been in the cure jar for a little while.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.080]  It's all the same process.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.400]  The leaves should be similar in dryness.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.160]  They should just be popping right off of there.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.520]  You might not even need scissors for this.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.960]  Sometimes when I'm dry trimming, the only thing I use my scissors for is for cutting
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.640]  the plant into smaller pieces and cutting the sticks out and cutting the bigger buds
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.840]  down to smaller buds.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.080]  Let's talk about a few preparations we can make and a few items we can have to create
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:44.640]  a comfortable and successful trim environment for ourselves.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.640]  Trimming sucks.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.920]  It's going to take a long time.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.280]  You're sitting in a chair with your elbows up high, staring straight into something for
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.280]  a long time.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:57.640]  Your neck, your elbows, your eyes, your back, that stuff all gets sore and tired.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:00.120]  Let's try to make it as comfortable as possible.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.640]  I like to have a nice clean space.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.400]  I've got this table where I like to do my work.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.840]  I clean the whole table off.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.600]  There's nothing on the table except my Dr. Pepper and some trim supplies.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.440]  Maybe my phone for some entertainment.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.440]  But it's just there for music.
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.440]  I'm not going to be touching it.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.200]  Don't have your phone out if you're trimming.
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.200]  It's so fucking distracting.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200]  It will slow you down.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.200]  It will take twice as long.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.760]  Put on a podcast, hit play, start fucking trimming.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.640]  Anyway, I like to have the table nice and clean.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.920]  I don't need shit in my way.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:27.200]  I need maybe my scissors for cutting my buds into smaller pieces and then just a few basic
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.920]  essentials and we'll talk about those.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.120]  A nice clean space.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.320]  I also like a nice comfortable chair.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.020]  You're going to be sitting there for a while.
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.020]  Get a cozy chair.
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:39.380]  A nice clean workspace and a cozy chair are super important for me for trimming.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:41.780]  But then you need some sort of entertainment.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:43.580]  Hopefully you got somebody there to talk to.
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:46.140]  Usually I got Mike or somebody around to bullshit with.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:49.580]  Some sort of conversation makes trimming go much more smoothly.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:52.300]  But if you don't have that option, put on a podcast.
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:53.540]  I like to put on a podcast.
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:56.920]  Of course, I recommend old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.960]  Put on some Joe Rogan, something like that.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.440]  Maybe a YouTube video.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:03.900]  Something to entertain yourself to listen to but nothing to look at.
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:07.820]  Back in the day, we used to trim all around the TV and we would watch YouTube videos and trim.
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:10.100]  I found that that is super distracting.
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.300]  Don't watch videos.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:14.060]  People will put their fucking scissors down and you'll catch them just watching TV.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:17.060]  If you're paying people to trim, don't have a TV in the room.
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.680]  Podcasts, maybe some stand-up comedy.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.520]  It's hard to get everybody on the same page when it comes to music, but maybe play some
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.620]  good music.
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:27.060]  Just some sort of stuff to make it comfortable and help the time pass without your brain
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:28.940]  going crazy is what I'm getting at, you guys.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:29.940]  So you got a clean space.
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:30.940]  You got a chair to sit in.
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.180]  You got a good YouTube video on.
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:33.180]  You got a podcast going.
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:34.460]  So now you're cozy.
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:35.460]  Your mind is entertained.
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:36.820]  Now you need some gloves.
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.460]  Put some rubber gloves on.
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.900]  You want to wear gloves when you're trimming.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:42.580]  You're going to get extremely sticky.
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.540]  You don't want to have to itch your face and have to go wash your hands just to scratch
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:46.740]  your face.
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:50.180]  Your hands are going to be covered in trichomes and resin, you guys.
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.180]  Wear gloves.
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.900]  Also, you need some good scissors.
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:57.180]  I like the little tiny Fiskars diamond tip scissors that you get.
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.380]  They're expensive at the grocery store.
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:16:59.620]  They're cheaper at Hobby Lobby.
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:01.260]  They sell them in the craft section.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:02.620]  Right at the craft section at Hobby Lobby.
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:04.060]  All of Hobby Lobby.
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:06.740]  They sell them in the fabric section over by the fabric.
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:09.220]  There are Fiskars diamond tip titanium scissors.
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.740]  I really like those.
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:12.020]  They work really well for trimming.
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.020]  They're super light.
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:15.700]  Get something with a spring in it that opens on its own because you don't want to have
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.580]  to be opening and closing scissors.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:20.100]  You don't want the kind of scissors that have loops that go around your fingers because
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.580]  you're going to be cutting for so long.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:24.100]  Those little loops around your fingers are going to dig into you.
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.660]  You just want lightweight, super fast trimming shears.
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:29.540]  They're easy to find and they're affordable.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:33.220]  You can get yourselves two pair so that you can set one in the rubbing alcohol to clean
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:34.220]  off.
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:35.220]  You can dirty up another pair.
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.220]  Swap them out real quick.
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:38.580]  Not have to spend a lot of time cleaning your scissors.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.620]  You need some good gloves, some good scissors.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:42.700]  Then you need some containers.
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.780]  You need a container for untrimmed buds.
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:47.840]  I recommend a five gallon bucket for the untrimmed buds.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.180]  Maybe you don't have that much herb.
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:50.940]  Maybe something smaller will work.
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:53.740]  Then you need another container for trimmed buds.
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:56.900]  Then you need another container for saveable trim.
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.260]  Then we need another container for waste.
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:03.740]  You need trimmed buds, untrimmed buds, usable trim, and waste.
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.140]  A couple of other things I'm going to recommend and you're going to say, why the hell would
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.780]  he recommend this for a grow?
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:11.700]  I would recommend either some coconut oil or some baby oil for your trim session.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.900]  You're going to say, why do we need that?
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:15.140]  Here is why.
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:19.200]  When your fingers and hands and arms get all sticky, you can use the coconut oil or the
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.820]  baby oil to remove the trichomes.
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:21.820]  That's right.
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.060]  If your hands are all covered in resin, my thing is that my arms get covered in resin
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:26.340]  because I'm the one cutting down the plants.
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:28.700]  I'm reaching in there and playing with them and carrying them around.
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:32.580]  My arm hair and shit gets all coated in trichomes and plant resin.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:36.660]  I use the coconut oil or baby oil to just rub up on my arms and rub that shit right
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:40.740]  off and all the resin comes right off and then you're not all sticky.
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:44.540]  That's a basic breakdown of things that you're going to need for your trim session.
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:46.340]  You need a nice clean space in which to work.
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:48.860]  You need a nice cozy chair in which to sit.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:51.940]  Need a good podcast to listen to, probably the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:52.940]  Then you need some gloves.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:53.940]  You need scissors.
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:54.940]  Then you need your containers.
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:56.380]  Then you've got your cleanup supplies.
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:58.660]  Now, let's talk about doing the manual work.
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:03.740]  Hopefully, a few days before harvest, you went in and did a pre-harvest defoliation.
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:07.860]  What I mean by that is while the plants are still alive, while you're flushing, anywhere
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:12.340]  between seven days before harvest up to the day of harvest, you can go in there and just
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:15.140]  start pulling off all of the big leaves.
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:16.260]  The plants are done growing.
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.260]  They're just flushing out.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:18.260]  They're just finishing up.
[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:19.260]  The trichomes are ripening up.
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.220]  You don't need all that excess leaf in there.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:24.100]  Just go ahead and tear all that leaf out of the room.
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:28.180]  Having a pre-harvest defoliation session will save you a lot of time when it comes time
[01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:32.860]  to trim because all of that long, straggly leaf is already gone.
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:33.940]  It's not even there to deal with.
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:35.100]  It's already been removed.
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:38.380]  It will also help your drying and curing time.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:41.220]  Go in and pull off all the big leaves before you harvest.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:42.220]  Then it's harvest time.
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:44.560]  I've done a highly detailed harvest episode.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.580]  If you haven't listened to that, go listen to that, then come catch up.
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:52.700]  At the end of the harvest episode, we're left with our plants hanging upside down in a controlled
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:53.700]  environment.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.420]  Now, we want those plants to get to where the sticks snap.
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:59.540]  Once the sticks get snappy, you can start trimming.
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:03.340]  You can also start trimming them after they've been in their cure containers for a little
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:04.340]  while.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:05.340]  I like dry trim.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:09.380]  I'm just waiting for the buds to be dry enough to where the leaves just flake right off.
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.300]  There's still going to be moisture inside those buds.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:14.780]  There's moisture in the middle, but the outside is dry enough to where you can just knock
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:17.380]  the leaves off the buds with your thumb.
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:20.940]  I'm making a little motion with my hands that sort of looks like I'm playing a video game.
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.260]  I've got a game controller in my hand, but my hands are really close together.
[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:28.340]  In my mind, I'm just holding that little bud with my forefingers or maybe with my left
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:32.580]  hand and I'm just knocking the leaves off with my right hand.
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:34.820]  Just like I'm just ... It looks like I'm playing a video game.
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:37.380]  I'm just holding the bud and just rubbing the leaves right off.
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:40.900]  If you hold it with the bud facing up, if you rub down, those leaves will just rub right
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:41.900]  off.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.580]  You'll see what I'm talking about when you figure out the technique.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.620]  You go, man, that is so easy.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:48.140]  My point is that I want it to where the buds are dry.
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:50.180]  I want to be able to just knock those leaves right off.
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:53.420]  Here is how I actually do my trimming.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.940]  Whenever I'm working with the plants, I like to wear gloves.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:58.580]  Step one of trimming is put on some rubber gloves.
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:00.540]  I like the six millimeter nitrile gloves.
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:01.540]  I don't care if they're black.
[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:02.700]  I don't care if they're blue.
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:05.380]  I just care that they fit and that they're comfortable.
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:06.380]  Glove up.
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:10.540]  I don't want to get all sticky and also I don't want to get my skin all over the buds.
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:12.100]  Step one is glove up.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:16.980]  Step two of trimming is to knock all of the buds off of the sticks into a five gallon
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:17.980]  bucket.
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:18.980]  This makes it so much easier.
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:23.740]  Just go and get every bud off the sticks into a bucket and then discard all the sticks.
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:26.980]  Now you've compressed your work into a much smaller space.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:30.420]  It looks way less overwhelming and you can see what you've got ahead of you.
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:33.900]  You've got a five gallon bucket filled with buds that you need to trim.
[01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:37.900]  It doesn't look like this big sprawl of branches and leaves and shit everywhere.
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:38.900]  Just a bucket.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:41.620]  It's way less intimidating and you can get through it.
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:44.100]  Knock all the buds into a bucket.
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.740]  Maybe you can use just a small bowl.
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.140]  Maybe you can use something smaller.
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.460]  I'm not sure how much you grew.
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:49.460]  Maybe you need five buckets.
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:53.460]  I hope you need 10 or 25 gallon buckets, but find the container that's the right size for
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.460]  what you need.
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:58.980]  A five gallon bucket from Home Depot or Lowe's is really affordable and they're disposable,
[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.900]  so I like to use the buckets.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:03.900]  So I knock every bud into a bucket.
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.180]  Now I've got a five gallon bucket full of buds.
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:11.060]  My next step is just to reach in, grab the bud off the top and start trimming.
[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:14.580]  Now I'll actually start talking about trimming a little bit and the actual trimming of the
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.020]  bud process.
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:20.740]  The idea is to knock or cut off all of the excessive leaves and stems and give yourself
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:24.360]  a nice, pretty, presentable bud.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.420]  You guys know what a good trimmed bud looks like.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.540]  When they start off, they're covered in leaves.
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.940]  It's our job to knock those leaves off.
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.220]  We don't want to smoke leaves.
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:33.780]  Leaves contain chlorophyll.
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:35.020]  Leaves don't taste good.
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:36.420]  Leaves don't get you high.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:40.340]  What we want is a nice, frosty, green nugget.
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:44.620]  So once you guys get started trimming, you'll see what's leaf material and what is a usable
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:45.620]  bud.
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.460]  If you guys start digging in there and just start knocking off some of the leaf, you'll
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:51.620]  find that bud in the middle and it will start to become very obvious what you do and do
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:52.900]  not trim.
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:56.420]  If your buds are kind of airy and fluffy, don't trim too deeply.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:57.900]  Just knock off the leaves.
[01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:01.580]  I like to grab the bud by the base, by that little stick at the bottom of the bud and
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:03.620]  just use my thumb to push the leaves off.
[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:06.580]  I just kind of spin the bud in a circle with my left hand.
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:07.580]  I will turn it.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:08.580]  I'm looking, that's counterclockwise.
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:09.580]  No, that is clockwise.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:13.740]  I'll turn the bud clockwise and as it comes toward me, I'll use my right thumb.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:18.180]  I'm using my left hand to spin the bud toward me and as that one side comes toward me, my
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.420]  thumb just knocks the leaves off right there.
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:23.540]  I'm just wiping them off like I'm just scraping the leaves off.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:27.500]  They're so dry that they knock off on their own and don't press so hard that you're fucking
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.580]  up the shape of the bud and knocking off trichomes.
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:31.260]  You can do this really gently.
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:33.740]  You'll find the technique after you do it a few times.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:36.420]  It'll be really comfortable and you'll get really fast at it.
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.140]  A lot of people like to do this with scissors.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:41.540]  They'll hold it in their left hand and they'll take their scissors and just turn it and trim
[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:42.540]  it.
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.860]  You don't want to take it off horizontally.
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.580]  Just keep your scissors horizontal.
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:49.340]  You can adjust your angle as you need and just spin that bud and keep cutting just like
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:50.340]  you're giving it a haircut.
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:53.300]  You just want to take off those leaves and leave that bud there.
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:55.380]  Just knock off the leaves.
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:58.900]  Don't carve too deeply into the buds and don't squish the buds while you're trimming them.
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:02.020]  Don't squeeze them super hard and try not to handle them too much.
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:04.140]  A little tiny bud doesn't need a lot of handling.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.520]  You don't want to get all those trichomes on your gloves.
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:09.260]  You want to leave the trichomes on the buds.
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:10.460]  You can use scissors if you want.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.700]  I like my thumbs for most trimming, you guys.
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:15.580]  The little edge of my thumb and my thumbnail is a perfect little trimmer for me.
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.500]  I've mastered that technique.
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:20.900]  I knock off the little leaves and cut the big buds into smaller sizes.
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:25.060]  If you guys can see a stick in there and it's like one bud and then a little stick and another
[01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.100]  bud, take that shit out.
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:28.140]  Nobody wants to buy a stick.
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:31.500]  Connoisseur quality bud is taken down to the small part.
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.580]  If you want to leave your buds in big buds, that's fine.
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:36.060]  It's up to you.
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:37.380]  I like them smaller.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:39.180]  A lot of people don't want to buy a big stick.
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:41.980]  You'll have some customers that want big buds.
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:45.260]  I used to have people that just wanted big buds and then some people know better.
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:49.220]  They're like, man, I don't want to buy that quarter, that one bud that weighs a quarter
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:52.540]  because I know right up the middle of it is a gram of stick and I'm getting ripped off.
[01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:54.500]  Some people want it, some people don't.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.740]  That's up to you.
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:25:01.740]  Once you've got it trimmed up to the size you want it and the amount of trim you want,
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:04.900]  I cut off all the little leaves at the bottom also.
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.180]  A lot of people leave little cabbage-y looking leaves at the bottom.
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.540]  I cut that shit off.
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:09.580]  I call it cabbage.
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.900]  I also take out the handlebar sticks.
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:15.500]  On the bottom you're going to have the branch that the bud was actually stuck to the branch
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:16.500]  to.
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.820]  Then there's two little sticks that come out that those first leaves were attached to and
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.220]  they're all dry and shitty looking.
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:21.500]  Cut those off of there.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:25.900]  If you've got a pound of weed and you've got all those little tiny sticks in there, those
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.780]  little sticks make your pound look like shit.
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:29.860]  Just take it out and your pound is going to look so much better.
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:31.660]  It's going to be so much more desirable.
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.580]  It's going to get you more money.
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:34.580]  That's the bottom line here.
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.660]  Trim it and it's worth more money.
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:37.980]  Take off all the leaves.
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:39.820]  Take off that little stick at the bottom.
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:40.980]  Knock off all the crow's feet.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:45.040]  If you've got a little tiny pointy leaf sticking out of somewhere, cut that out or knock it
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.100]  off with your thumb.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.500]  Those little triangle leaves make you look lazy.
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.820]  If you did a whole good job on most of the bud and you just left one or two little triangles
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.720]  at the tip, you look lazy.
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.900]  Take that stuff out of there.
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:26:00.180]  While I'm doing this, all the trimming work, I trim over a tray or a container to catch
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:01.540]  what I trim off.
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:05.540]  All that little stuff that gets clipped off is going to be used to make concentrates or
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.780]  edibles in the future.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.060]  Gather all that stuff up.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:10.060]  Take care of it.
[01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:12.340]  Don't just trim into the floor and then sweep it up.
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:14.180]  Don't trim onto the table and then scoop it up.
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.180]  Trim onto a tray.
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:18.700]  Trim into a container so that it is kept clean so it's treated with respect because it may
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:19.700]  go into edibles.
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:22.900]  Things that you're going to eat need to be treated with respect.
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:25.740]  Things you're going to smoke need to be treated with respect.
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.340]  This is our medicine.
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:29.420]  Gather this stuff up and vacuum seal it.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:33.900]  I like to keep the trim in a vacuum sealed bag in the dark until I'm able to use it.
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:36.860]  Get that to your extractor as soon as you can.
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:39.180]  The sticks, those are thrown away.
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:40.860]  I throw all the sticks away.
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:42.660]  In a commercial grow, they're thrown away.
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:46.500]  In a home grow, those should go to the compost pile or they could be burned or something.
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.520]  But the sticks are trash.
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.340]  Don't try to extract sticks, you guys.
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:51.340]  That's a waste of time.
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:52.420]  It's a waste of energy.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.220]  You're not going to get anything out of it.
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:58.680]  And also, if you're adding the sticks to the trim, you're just making the hash worse.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.320]  You're not making it better.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.420]  What goes in comes out.
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:05.580]  And if you just put shit in to make more, you're going to get more, but it's going to
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:06.580]  be shit.
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:13.300]  Gather up all your trim, vacuum seal the trim, keep the trim in a dark place, and get that
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:16.300]  to somebody that can turn that into concentrates for you.
[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:22.220]  Also, if you've got yellow or brown or funky leaves that are falling off as you're trimming,
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:23.220]  separate those.
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.580]  Pull those out of the trim.
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:26.260]  Don't send that to the extractor.
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:27.700]  That's going to make your hash dark.
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.440]  It's going to make your hash taste like shit.
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:32.340]  It's going to make it less potent, and it's going to make it less desirable.
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:37.740]  Do a little work, clean it up, get it out of there, and you will have a better product.
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:41.280]  Use your thumbs or some scissors to gently remove the excess leaves and the little stems
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.280]  from the buds.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.280]  Get rid of the handlebars.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.280]  Get rid of the crow's feet.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:49.380]  Now, once the buds are trimmed to your satisfaction, you can place them into a container for finished
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:50.380]  products.
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:53.660]  Now, when I say to your satisfaction, how you want to trim your buds is up to you.
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:55.780]  If you want to leave it a little fluffy, go for it.
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:58.180]  If you want to trim it nice and tight, go for it.
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:00.300]  That is up to you.
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:04.100]  If your product is for you personally, then you can leave it as leafy as you want.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:06.440]  You can knock those leaves off right before you smoke it.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:07.740]  You can clean it up yourself.
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:11.940]  If you plan on getting top dollar for your product, you'll need to have a tight, clean
[01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:13.560]  trim job.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:17.020]  One thing I should mention that will help us speed up the process of trimming is the
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:18.020]  rule of thumb.
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:21.900]  If the bud you are trimming is not bigger than the tip of your thumb, it's probably
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:26.500]  better to let that bud go to your hash pile and trim something more substantial.
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:30.220]  Put those little popcorn buds in the hash pile, put it in your trim pile, and you can
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:33.260]  make better hash that will improve the quality of your concentrate.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:36.060]  If it's a little tiny bud, don't waste time trimming it.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.100]  Just throw it in the hash pile.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:39.880]  Don't waste your time trimming little tiny buds.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:44.460]  If you feel like that little tiny bud is worth less money than the time it is taking you
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:47.440]  to trim it, set it aside and put it in the hash pile.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:48.960]  You don't have to trim that.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:55.580]  If herb costs $10 a gram and it takes you a minute to trim that little nug, it's not
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:56.580]  cost effective.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.580]  Toss that little nug into the trim bin.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:28:59.860]  We'll add that to the concentrates.
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:04.100]  Grab something that we can trim and get on the shelf and make it purchasable for the
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:05.720]  consumer.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:08.120]  If it's real tiny, if it's ugly, don't bother trimming it.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.240]  You can put that in your hash pile.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:15.060]  You can add that to the to-be-extracted pile, and that will just improve your concentrates.
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.540]  It will also speed you up.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:21.180]  Of course, if you need every little half gram, every piece of gravel out of that crop to
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:24.040]  make your goal, to make your weight, go ahead and trim that up.
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.040]  Add that.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.480]  Put that in the bottom of the bag.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.360]  But if it's not necessary, if it's just for you, put that in the concentrate pile and
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.000]  speed yourself up.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.720]  In a commercial grow, the growers are expected to kick out a pound minimum per person per
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:38.720]  shift.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.320]  Some people turn in two pounds every day.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.800]  If they spend time trimming that little gravel shit, they would never get there.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.280]  We have a way of separating all those little tiny buds.
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.760]  All that little stuff gets filtered out.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.680]  It gets pushed to the side.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:53.380]  Then all of that, those little buds and the trim, they're combined and it gets turned
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:55.180]  into concentrates.
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:58.720]  Do a nice tight trim if you want to sell it, but don't go overboard.
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.140]  Don't trim it too tight.
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:03.460]  Also don't try trimming all those little buds or you're going to put yourself in debt.
[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:04.840]  You've got to pay your trimmers.
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:06.180]  You're spending your time.
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:07.420]  Make it cost effective.
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:10.860]  Now, something I want to mention, trimming will be very strain dependent.
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.860]  Some buds are tight.
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:15.020]  Some buds are real fluffy.
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.140]  Some buds are little compacted little rocks.
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:20.260]  You can just rub your fingers over those and those are going to trim.
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:23.500]  Some buds are airy and have a lot of texture to them.
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.180]  Those are going to be a little harder to trim because you don't want to knock off all those
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:27.180]  calyxes.
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:28.180]  You're going to have to adjust.
[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:32.220]  Also, if you're working for somebody else, you're going to have to adjust to how they
[01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:33.460]  want it trimmed.
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:37.260]  When you go to a grow and you're working for someone else, they get to dictate how tight
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.540]  your trim is.
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:39.620]  Don't over trim.
[01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:40.620]  Don't under trim.
[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:41.900]  You trim to their expectation.
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:45.140]  If you're not sure what they want, have them trim up a bud and show you.
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:48.300]  Have them trim up two or three buds and set those at your workstation so you have something
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:51.260]  to refer to as the day goes on so that you don't forget.
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:53.900]  Also, if they come by and say, hey, why are you doing it like that?
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:55.340]  You got a couple little buds to show them.
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:57.100]  You can say, hey, these are what you showed me.
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:58.100]  This is what I did.
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:30:59.100]  Show me the difference.
[01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:00.100]  Show me where I'm going wrong.
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:01.820]  Then they can say, fuck, you're doing it just like I showed you.
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:02.820]  I'm sorry.
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:04.140]  We got a nice tight trim.
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:05.500]  We're setting the trim in one pile.
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.700]  We're setting our little tiny buds in another pile.
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:10.300]  We're mixing that up so we can make good concentrates out of it.
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:11.940]  We're getting rid of all the sticks.
[01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:15.060]  You guys, I think we have covered most of trimming.
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:18.420]  One great thing about trimming is scissor and glove hatch.
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:22.020]  All that sticky shit that builds up on your gloves and scissors is smokeable.
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:23.900]  You can smoke that right away.
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:25.880]  Mike loves scissor hatch.
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:29.060]  What I like to do if I've been trimming, so say you've been trimming, you've got this
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:33.060]  weird layer of sticky, gooey looking shit all over your gloves.
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.060]  That's resin.
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:35.060]  That's trichomes.
[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:36.060]  That is potency.
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:39.380]  Rub your hands together and you'll start figuring out how to rub your hands in a circle to make
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:40.740]  that stuff stick together.
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:42.500]  A little bit of heat goes a long way.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:46.260]  If your hands get warm, it'll start taking that resin right off of your hands.
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:48.420]  I don't want to smoke it off your skin.
[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:52.740]  Back in the day, we used to call it finger hatch, but please wear gloves now and we're
[01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.500]  going to call it glove hatch.
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:55.700]  You can scrape it off your scissors.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.300]  You can smoke it off your gloves.
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.300]  Then put it in a bowl.
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:01.860]  You can put it on top of some pot or just put it in an empty bowl and just put a flame
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:03.300]  to it and melt it.
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:06.900]  Just slowly melt that shit until it starts smoking and you can smoke that scissor hatch,
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.740]  that glove hatch, you can smoke it right away.
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:12.100]  But please don't pass that shit to me.
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:15.980]  If you did that off your skin and weren't wearing gloves, I don't want to smoke your
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:16.980]  skin.
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:21.220]  So that's one good thing about trimming is you get scissor hatch right away.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:23.700]  I think that anything that sticks to your gloves, that's yours.
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:24.700]  You get to smoke that.
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:27.620]  If you come trim for me and that shit sticks to your gloves, I have no problem with you
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:30.860]  rolling that right off your glove, put that in a pipe and smoke it right in front of me.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:31.860]  You earned that.
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:32.860]  That is your scissor hatch.
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.500]  That means you're trimming your ass off.
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:38.380]  If it's on your scissors, scrape your scissors off, smoke that shit.
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:41.580]  What a lot of people will do, all the trimmers in the room will just gather all their scissor
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:43.380]  hatch into one pile and put it into a big ball.
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:45.260]  And then at the end of the day, you guys all smoke that together.
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:48.660]  It's like a little celebration, but it's smokeable.
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:49.660]  That's my point.
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:53.300]  You can make edibles out of it if you want to, but I would recommend smoking it.
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:54.360]  Mike loves smoking it.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.520]  It's not my favorite to smoke.
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:59.700]  It's a little, it's heavy on the lungs and it tastes kind of wet, but it is potent and
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:02.780]  it will give you a big fat hit.
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:05.940]  Another great thing about dry trimming that I didn't mention is that when you were done
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.900]  trimming, you can now weigh your product.
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:10.060]  You've been cutting off the extra crap and throwing that in one pile.
[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:12.580]  Then you've been throwing those finished buds into one pile.
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:14.900]  All you got to do is set that container on the scale and weigh it.
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:17.420]  Now, one thing I would recommend is a good idea.
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:20.300]  Whatever container you're going to throw your buds into your finished buds.
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:24.420]  If it's going to be a bucket, if it's going to be a Tupperware container, weigh that and
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:28.620]  write the weight of that on your container so that when you're done trimming into that
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:30.880]  container, you know how much that weighs.
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:34.540]  So just subtract the weight of your container and now you know how much product is on the
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:35.540]  scale.
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:38.460]  So it's always rewarding knowing how much product you've got right at the end of the
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:39.460]  trim process.
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:40.460]  Now, how much do you trim?
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:42.460]  You don't know because you've got to wait for it to dry still.
[01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:43.900]  So when people say, how much did you trim today?
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:45.580]  And they said, I trimmed a wet pound.
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:46.580]  How do you know, bro?
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:47.580]  It was wet.
[01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:48.580]  It's got to dry.
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:49.580]  We'll find out in a few days.
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:52.980]  So if you're paying people to trim by the pound, dry trim is the way to go because now
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:54.660]  you've got dry pounds to weigh.
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.980]  You don't have a wet pound to guess on the weight.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:00.420]  So here's one more thing I should definitely mention to all of my friends who have never
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:03.260]  trimmed before, everybody who is new with cannabis.
[01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:05.580]  Here's something that I have to tell you.
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:10.860]  When you are trimming or working with plants in general, do not touch your eyes with sticky
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:13.220]  trim fingers.
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:15.460]  Don't rub your eye with the back of your hand.
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:18.140]  Go wash your hands before you touch your eyes.
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:22.860]  If you rub your eyes with trichomes or plant resin on your finger, it is going to burn
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:25.580]  for the next hour and it is sticky.
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:29.020]  Every time you blink, most of the time you think you can blink and it'll fix your sticky
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:30.740]  eye or whatever's in your eye.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.000]  Not when you have resin in your eye.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.180]  Every time you blink, it gets fucking stickier and it feels like your eyelid is sticking
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:37.300]  to your eyeball and it just burns.
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:43.180]  So wear gloves and if you need to itch your eye, take your fucking glove off your hand,
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:44.180]  then itch your eye.
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:47.020]  I would almost consider washing my hands before the itch.
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:49.540]  Take the glove off, go wash the hand, then scratch the eye.
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:52.020]  But I understand sometimes you just got to stick your finger in your eye because shit's
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.020]  going weird.
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.300]  Take that glove off you guys.
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:57.780]  Don't put plant resin or trichomes in your eye.
[01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:59.740]  It will fucking suck.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:00.820]  That's the technical term for it.
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:01.860]  It fucking sucks.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:03.100]  There's no other way to describe it.
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:04.260]  It fucking sucks you guys.
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:05.340]  All right.
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:07.100]  So I feel like I've given you a pretty good lesson on trimming.
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:10.460]  I know I didn't teach you exactly how to trim.
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:14.340]  The act of holding the bud and putting the scissors to it is something you're going to
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:15.380]  have to experience.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:17.620]  You will develop your technique and your style.
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:19.340]  I feel like I've given you a pretty good outline.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.580]  You know what to do with the product.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:21.900]  You know how to get it there.
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:23.760]  You just need some practice doing it.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.020]  Get some buds and put some scissors to them.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.860]  That's the only way you're going to get good at it.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:30.100]  It's the only way you're going to get faster at it.
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:34.340]  When we hire new trimmers at The Grow, we don't always hire the people that claim to
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:35.460]  be the fastest trimmers.
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:38.420]  We hire the people that interview well and seem like they're going to fit in with the
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:39.420]  crew.
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:43.100]  If they say they can only trim a half a pound of weed when they start, that is fine if that
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:44.100]  is real.
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:47.300]  If they say they can trim a half a pound and they only do a quarter pound, then I've got
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:48.300]  issues.
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:50.140]  But they say, I can trim a half a pound in a day.
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:51.140]  I'm fine with that.
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:52.300]  We will train them.
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:53.540]  We will teach them our system.
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:54.620]  We'll teach them some tricks.
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:55.620]  They'll get in.
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:56.620]  They'll get a rhythm.
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:57.620]  They'll get a routine.
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:00.260]  Ultimately, they'll be trimming a pound and a half a day.
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.620]  It's all about just finding the rhythm.
[01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:03.140]  It's all about finding the groove.
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:06.540]  It takes you a little bit of time and experience to get in there and do it.
[01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:08.220]  Also, these are buds.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.260]  These are precious to people.
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.100]  I've been in this industry for a long time.
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:15.940]  I can grab a flowering plant that's a few days in and just cut that fucker down and
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:17.340]  feel no remorse or anything.
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:20.740]  If that's what needed to happen in a commercial grow, I kill the plant.
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:24.260]  A lot of people treat little buds like they're the most precious thing they've ever seen,
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:25.340]  which I respect.
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:26.580]  You don't get to grow a bunch of plants.
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:30.100]  I have produced over a ton of cannabis in my life.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:33.260]  I am responsible for a ton of cannabis having been produced.
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:35.820]  A lot of people don't have that under their belt.
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:37.540]  Every bud is precious to them.
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:39.580]  They don't want to fuck up one single bud.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.580]  I get that.
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:44.060]  When they're new at it, they go really slow, especially a hired trimmer.
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:45.220]  That is not their product.
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:47.300]  That is your bud that they're playing with.
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:51.060]  Respect them for taking their time and going slow with it, but also encourage them to go
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:52.100]  faster.
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:54.460]  You have to learn and go faster.
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:58.020]  People like to go slow in the beginning because they're playing with gold.
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:00.100]  They're playing with little pieces of gold.
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:03.540]  They got little babies in their hand and they're new, so they're kind of intimidated.
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:04.860]  Keep that in mind.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:07.060]  You'll get faster as time goes on is what I'm trying to say, you guys.
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:08.060]  You just need some practice.
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.860]  You'll become a good trimmer if you want to become a good trimmer.
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:14.940]  If you want to get your foot in the door in the commercial marijuana industry, being a
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:18.860]  trimmer is probably the number one way to get in the door.
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:21.380]  Trimmers and bud tenders are how you get started.
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:26.420]  It can be really time consuming and tedious, but it is the last step before you claim victory
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:27.420]  in your garden.
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:30.820]  If your garden is for sale, you're one step away from money.
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:36.920]  If your garden is for medicinal uses, you're one step away from feeling better.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.740]  Trimming sucks, but you're almost there.
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:42.700]  It's the hardest, most time consuming, tedious part, in my opinion.
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:46.980]  It is my least favorite part, but it is one step away from sweet success.
[01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:48.420]  All right, podcast world.
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:50.300]  I hope this trimming lesson made sense.
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:54.500]  Again, the only way to get good at trimming is to get sticky and get some practice.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.700]  Get in there, get your gloves dirty, get your scissors all sticky, and start trimming up
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:37:58.700]  some weed.
[01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:02.260]  If you want to learn and you've got friends that are harvesting, volunteer to trim for
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:03.260]  free.
[01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:05.860]  Everybody could use a free trimmer, and we know we're going to have to teach you.
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:08.820]  That's fine, but we hope that in a few harvests, you're going to show up and you're going to
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.660]  trim your ass off like a savage.
[01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:14.120]  There are people that will help you learn by letting you trim for free.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.980]  If you get those opportunities, please do take them.
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:18.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure I left something out.
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:20.200]  I'm sure I missed something.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.880]  If I sparked any questions with this episode, I invite you to email me all of your questions.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.000]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.320]  I would love to hear what I skipped.
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.040]  I'd love to hear what I left out.
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:34.680]  Or if you've got some other random questions, I will answer those also.
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:37.840]  Once again, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening to the trimming episode.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.720]  Here is the part where I pitch my Patreon campaign.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:46.760]  I would truly appreciate your support on Patreon.
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.800]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks and you were able to contribute
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:56.440]  financially, you can do so by going to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:02.480]  That's P-A-T-R-E-O-N, patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:05.920]  If you'd like to contribute to the podcast, all the information that you need will be
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.480]  right there.
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:11.080]  If you contribute to the podcast, I will use those contributions to pay for the website
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.280]  that keeps the podcast free for everybody.
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:17.600]  I will also use those contributions to pay for the upgraded MacBook I bought so that
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:22.320]  I can keep the podcast coming and keep the videos coming to everybody for free.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.680]  You guys, I will never charge you for this podcast.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:29.400]  As long as I am able to put this podcast out for free, it will be free for you as well.
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:34.200]  I may in the future release some paid content, which will be bonus content, but this version
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:37.600]  of the podcast in this format always will be free.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:41.400]  iTunes, Stitcher, and the YouTube channel as it is will always be free.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:45.680]  I do this because I love cannabis and I love you and I want you to be able to medicate
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:51.080]  and recreate the best ways possible with the highest quality, cleanest, safest products
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.080]  available.
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.760]  I think the only way you can do that is by growing it yourself.
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:59.280]  I've got to teach you how to do that so that you don't have to rely on anybody else.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:03.000]  My point is that the podcast will be free, but I know there are people out there who
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.280]  would like to contribute because they emailed me and they said, hey Jeff, how can we help
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:07.280]  you out?
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.560]  Patreon is the best way to do that.
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.160]  Patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.840]  Also I would appreciate it if you stalk me on the social media.

[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:45.200]  Thanks again for listening to this episode, everybody.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.280]  I'll be back Monday with a brand new episode.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:50.200]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Grimbolt the Druid.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:55.120]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.480]  Welcome back podcast world.
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:00.080]  It's time for episode 394 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:02.880]  This episode is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.000]  If you need fresh seeds for your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds and you
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.080]  can find them at oregoneliteseeds.com.
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:15.040]  It's become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:21.120]  Today I'm taking dabs of vanilla cookies batter from Apothecary Farms and it tastes delicious.
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:24.920]  If you let the nail cool nice and cool, you get the real nice vanilla cream kind of a
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:26.120]  flavor out of it.
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:30.200]  If you're a savage and you hit it while the nail's a little bit hot, you get that spicy
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.840]  Durban poison part of the Girl Scout cookies flavor.
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:36.160]  And I really love both flavors and it really gives me a great buzz.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:39.960]  So I really enjoy the vanilla cookies from Apothecary Farms.
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.560]  Big shout out to everybody at Apothecary.
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:43.080]  Big shout out to all three locations.
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:44.760]  They've got a Pueblo location.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.760]  They've got a Colorado Springs location.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:50.020]  And by the time this comes out, they will have opened a Denver location.
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:54.240]  So big up and congratulations to all of my friends at Apothecary.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:57.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be another repost episode.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:01.360]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:05.120]  In the timeline of those grow lessons, it has become time to clean up and reset our
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:06.720]  garden for the next run.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.880]  I originally did this episode as number 327.
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:12.360]  I'm reposting it now as 392.
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:16.400]  So ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's clean up and reset our garden for the
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:17.400]  next run.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:20.620]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:24.640]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.640]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.640]  That's right.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.440]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:35.200]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.040]  current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:40.040]  I'm your host.
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:41.240]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:44.440]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:48.400]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.800]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.280]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:00.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:11.000]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.220]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:15.120]  It's time for episode 328 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.120]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:19.400]  You know I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm dabbing.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:24.040]  Today I'm smoking Stardog Ambrosia Batter from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.080]  If you know me, you know I love the Stardog.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:27.200]  I love the aroma.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.240]  I love the flavor.
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:29.240]  I love the high.
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:30.240]  I love the way it grows.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:32.800]  And of course, I love taking pictures of Stardog.
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:34.840]  She's a very photogenic strain.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:40.280]  So today I'm taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia Batter from our friends at Apothecary.
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:43.660]  Now if you've been following the show lately, you've probably caught the episodes about
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:46.920]  determining ripeness of your cannabis plants.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.800]  Then we did an episode about flushing your plants.
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.940]  Then we did an episode about harvesting.
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:55.080]  Then we did an episode about drying and curing your cannabis plants.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.000]  Then we did an episode about trimming.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.840]  Now it is time to clean up the grow room and get restarted for the next cycle.
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:06.520]  Let's talk a little bit about after harvest cleaning.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:10.880]  It sounds pretty basic, but there are a few things you may overlook.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:14.720]  Now if you had bugs or powdery mildew, you may want to step up your cleaning product.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:17.100]  You may want to step up your cleaning regimen.
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:21.440]  But if you didn't have any bugs or any issues, I think a light bleach and water solution
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.440]  should work.
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:27.560]  Or maybe you might want to get yourself some Fizan and use 15 to 20 mils of Fizan per gallon
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:28.560]  of water.
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:30.600]  Use that to clean up your whole grow.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:34.080]  Either way, whatever product you use, let's clean everything.
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:35.880]  Let's clean the walls.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:38.160]  Wipe down every inch of every wall.
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:41.720]  Start at one section at the top and just work your way down and to the right.
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:45.760]  And then just keep going until you've covered every inch of that grow room.
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.780]  Also if you can reach, scrub the ceiling.
[01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:49.160]  If you can't reach, find me.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.520]  I can probably reach.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:52.400]  If not, get a ladder.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:53.520]  Scrub the ceiling.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:58.040]  Let's clean it with either bleach and hot water or Fizan and hot water and just get
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:01.440]  anything off of there that may be hiding that we don't want in that grow room.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.600]  Maybe you've got a spider mite up there chilling out.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:06.880]  Maybe you've got a little bit of powdery mildew spore that you don't know about.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:09.600]  Maybe there's a piece of pollen up there that you don't know about.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.920]  Let's clean everything just to be sure.
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:12.960]  So clean the walls.
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:14.480]  Clean the ceiling.
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:16.960]  Clean your light reflectors.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:17.960]  Clean the lights.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:20.720]  The top of the lights, they're probably dusty up on top.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:23.560]  The reflectors, they're dusty on the inside.
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:24.920]  Clean those things.
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:28.200]  Take this opportunity while the room's empty and clean everything, you guys.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:31.320]  So take the light reflectors down if you think they need some cleaning.
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.320]  Clean them.
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:33.800]  Hang them back up.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:34.980]  Clean your fans.
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:37.040]  Take the fans off of the wall.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:38.840]  Take the little grate off the front.
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.920]  Unscrew the little thing that holds the blades on.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:42.360]  Take the blades off.
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:43.360]  Clean the blades.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.560]  I know they're dirty.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:46.280]  Fans get disgusting.
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:51.120]  The grate on the back is filled with muck and hair and just weird random gunk that I
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.040]  can't even tell you what it is.
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.400]  Clean that shit out of there.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:57.480]  You're probably going to be disgusted that you've been blowing that shit around in your
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.480]  grow.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.480]  Clean your fans.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:03.480]  While you're cleaning the fans, look at anything that moves air or blows air.
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:06.760]  Look at the air return on your dehumidifier.
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:09.960]  That thing's pulling in a bunch of water and a bunch of air and then it's blowing air back
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:10.960]  out.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.400]  Does that filter need to be changed?
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:15.000]  Does that dehumidifier need to be cleaned off?
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.480]  Is the water line that's draining water out of your dehumidifier, is it gunky?
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:20.800]  Does it need to be cleaned?
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:25.600]  Is the reservoir that you're draining your dehumidifier water into starting to develop
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.160]  slime and algae?
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.040]  If so, you need to clean that.
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:31.240]  Stay on top of those sort of things.
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:32.240]  Clean the walls.
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:33.240]  Clean the lights.
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.240]  Clean the fans.
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.240]  Clean your dehumidifier.
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:36.240]  Dust everything.
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:38.600]  The top of everything is dusty.
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.200]  The top of everything is funky.
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:42.120]  You've been spraying pesticides in there.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:45.560]  Imagine you sprayed some sticky pesticide like Azimax in there.
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:47.080]  Then it got dusty.
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.560]  It's just sticking to the Azimax.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:49.560]  It's funky.
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.560]  It's gross.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.560]  Clean everything.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.520]  Wipe it and dust the tops of everything.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.960]  Clean your hydro tables.
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:57.000]  If you've got tables in the room, clean them.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.440]  If you've got trays and you can take them outside, take them outside.
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:01.440]  Spray them down with the hose.
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:04.640]  If you've got a power washer, hit them with the power washer.
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:07.840]  If those tables are real dirty, scrub them down with some Fizan.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:09.360]  Scrub them down with some bleach.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.840]  Make sure you rinse them out real good and just get them real clean.
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:13.560]  The Fizan is going to foam up.
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.560]  Be prepared for that.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:16.280]  You're going to make foam with Fizan.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:19.640]  Make sure you clean everything out when you're done using cleaning products.
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:24.260]  Clean out your tables and reservoirs really well if you use a cleaning product.
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:26.200]  Rinse the shit out of those hydro tables.
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:28.760]  Rinse the shit out of all your tubing and all of your lines.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:32.560]  Clean that stuff so that it's not clogged and so there's no algae in there.
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:35.560]  Here's something people don't pay enough attention to.
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.560]  Clean the floor.
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.560]  Yes, I know.
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.800]  We just walk on the floor all day, right?
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.800]  Sweep it.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:41.800]  Mop it.
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.920]  If you've got some sort of poly film or panda film on the floor, some sort of subfloor,
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.320]  does it need to be replaced?
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.760]  Are there holes in it?
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:53.440]  Has your poly or your panda film started stretching and getting holes from the staples?
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.720]  Do you need to duct tape some spots?
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:57.560]  Check that kind of stuff out.
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:58.900]  Clean your floors.
[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:00.120]  Everything lands on the floor.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:01.480]  The floor is gross.
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:02.480]  Clean it up.
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.580]  Also, here's something I should mention.
[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:09.360]  If you've got light reflectors with glass on them so that they're air cooled, clean
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:10.360]  that glass.
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:11.600]  Take that glass out.
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.080]  Take that shit down with some Windex.
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:14.940]  Let it dry and put it back.
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:16.640]  Clean the reflector glass.
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:19.480]  Also, clean all of your air conditioner filters.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:20.480]  Check them.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:21.480]  Make sure they are clean.
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:24.020]  If you've got ducting anywhere, check your ducting.
[01:48:24.020 --> 01:48:26.520]  Make sure the ducting isn't bent in any weird places.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:27.720]  Make sure there are no clogs.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:30.080]  Make sure all of your duct is secured.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:33.280]  Make sure it's duct taped or clamped somewhere so that the air you're trying to move away
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.920]  from the grow doesn't accidentally end up being blown right where you don't need it.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:41.200]  If you've got a leak, that air is just going to come flying out of there.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:44.720]  You may just be moving the heat from the light right back into the grow room.
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:47.000]  Then your air conditioner has to work harder.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.640]  You can't figure out why the room isn't cooling down and it gets frustrating.
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:52.200]  Check all of your ducting.
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.200]  Check your carbon filter.
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:56.060]  Is that carbon filter still filtering?
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:58.200]  Can you smell the herb outside when you grow?
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.820]  Did anybody mention that your harvest stunk really badly?
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:03.360]  How long have you had that carbon filter?
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:04.760]  Did you write it down?
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:08.000]  You should know when that carbon filter needs to be replaced.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.120]  A lot of the brands say they will last two years.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:11.880]  I never believe in that.
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:14.720]  I've never had a carbon filter last two years.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:19.360]  Also, that carbon filter cover, maybe you're going to leave that filter there for two years
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.600]  and it's got that little dust cover on it.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:27.160]  Take that ugly thing off, throw it in the washer with some OxiClean and clean that thing.
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:32.400]  Nobody wants to see your pictures of your black and gray carbon filter dust cover.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.400]  That is gross.
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:36.240]  Also, you guys, get in there and clean out the reservoir.
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:40.080]  If you've got a reservoir that you mix your nutrients in or that you use as part of your
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:45.440]  hydro system that you're pumping your nutrients from right to your plants, clean that reservoir.
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:47.040]  Why wouldn't you want to clean fresh start?
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:51.080]  You don't want biofilm and funk in there because that's going directly to your plants.
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:52.640]  Also, clean all of the tubing.
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:57.520]  I've already said that once, but clean it all because all that gunk will end up into
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:49:59.600]  your plants.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.040]  Another thing we should remember to clean is the emitters.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:05.960]  If you've got a hydro system with some sprayers or emitters or sprinklers at the end of a
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:09.440]  line, make sure you pop those emitters off and clean them.
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:12.240]  They like to get filled with some gunky funk.
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:17.200]  Now is the perfect opportunity to take all those off and clean them up real well.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.320]  Another really important thing we can do while we've got the room taken down, we can decide
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:23.360]  if we need to replace any bulbs.
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.640]  How long have your bulbs been in the grow?
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:31.320]  Depending on what type of lighting you're using, it may be time to swap out some bulbs.
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:35.460]  When bulbs get old, they still draw the same amount of electricity, but they do not put
[01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:38.020]  out the same amount of light.
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:42.140]  You're paying for that electricity and it is not making it to your plants.
[01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:44.540]  Check your bulbs and see if they need to be replaced.
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:48.880]  A good way to find out if they need to be replaced is to get a lumen meter.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:52.700]  A lumen meter will measure how much light is coming from your bulb.
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:58.340]  If your bulb is putting out less than 75 or 80% of its maximum output, it is time to replace
[01:50:58.340 --> 01:50:59.340]  it.
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:01.780]  Now, how do you know what the maximum output of that bulb is?
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:06.380]  The way to find that out is to buy a brand new bulb, put the bulb in your reflector and
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:07.380]  turn it on.
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:10.980]  Then you've got to wait a few minutes and let that bulb get to its maximum brightness.
[01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:14.660]  It takes a little while for the bulbs to heat up and get to the right spectrum and get all
[01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:15.660]  the way bright.
[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:20.620]  Once it's bright and all the way heated up, go about 12 to 18 inches from that bulb and
[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:23.280]  measure what the lumens are right there and write it down.
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:26.260]  Write down the date and the amount of lumens.
[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:28.780]  Then check it now when you're cleaning the room.
[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:32.340]  Go the same distance away with that lumen meter and see how many lumens are popping
[01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:33.500]  up.
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:37.140]  If you're not satisfied with the amount of power you're getting out of that bulb, it
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:38.740]  is time to replace it.
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:42.540]  If you feel like you're paying for electricity that is not making it to your plants, it is
[01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:45.700]  time to replace your bulb.
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:50.620]  Lumen meters may be expensive, but a lot of times the grow shop will let you borrow one
[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:54.660]  because they know that if your bulbs are bad, you're probably just going to come buy more
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:57.020]  bulbs when you return the lumen meter.
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:58.580]  So ask them at the grow store.
[01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:00.540]  They may have one available that you can borrow.
[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:04.620]  All right, guys, most of the cleaning stuff should be fairly obvious.
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:07.080]  Clean the shit out of everything, scrub everything.
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:10.060]  If you're going to put plants in anything that had a cleaner in it, make sure you get
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:11.780]  that cleaner out.
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:13.660]  Replace the bulbs, replace the filters.
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:18.580]  Some other things we may not remember to think about are check and reset your timers and
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:20.140]  all of your programs.
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:23.420]  If you've got your lights on a certain schedule, fix that schedule.
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:27.580]  If you've got your CO2 or your auto watering on a schedule, make sure you correct that
[01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:30.140]  schedule before you put new plants in here.
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:31.900]  Did daylight savings time happen?
[01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:32.900]  Check that.
[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:35.020]  Is the timer on the right time?
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:37.060]  Is your timer on the right day?
[01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:39.960]  A lot of the controllers have a day that you can set.
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:41.380]  Is it Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday?
[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:42.380]  Is it the proper day?
[01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:44.820]  Do you have AM and PM set properly?
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:49.540]  Make sure you check out all of your controllers before you put plants in there and you accidentally
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:52.060]  flower them way too early.
[01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:55.500]  Also check out all of your CO2 controls.
[01:52:55.500 --> 01:53:00.260]  Another thing I like to do at this point in time is calibrate all of my pens and meters.
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:02.020]  I like to calibrate my pH pen.
[01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:04.860]  I like to make sure that my EC meter is working properly.
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:07.260]  These are all things that you should check on between harvest.
[01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:11.540]  I like to calibrate my meters about once every two weeks to tell you the truth, probably
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:12.620]  every 10 days.
[01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:17.420]  I just like to check on them and make sure that those things are accurate.
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:22.220]  Another thing, you should have a fire extinguisher near your grow.
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:23.220]  Check on that.
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:24.660]  Look at the little gauge on there.
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:26.140]  Make sure it's in the green.
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:31.120]  If your fire extinguisher gauge is not in the green, either buy a new one or take it
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:34.660]  to the fire department and have it refilled correctly.
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:38.980]  I really hope you don't have to use that fire extinguisher, but if you need it, I really
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:40.780]  want it to work for you.
[01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:43.300]  Also check the batteries in your smoke alarm.
[01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:45.420]  Yes, I said smoke alarm.
[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:47.820]  Your grow should have a smoke alarm.
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:51.460]  You don't want to burn down the house because something went wrong in the grow room and
[01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:55.140]  you did not have a smoke detector and a fire extinguisher.
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:56.700]  Be a responsible grower.
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:54:00.260]  Make sure that the safety precautions are in place.
[01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:03.900]  Since we're checking on the fire extinguisher and the smoke alarm, it is a good time to
[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:05.700]  check on your respirator.
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:08.660]  Are you using a respirator to apply pesticides?
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:11.380]  I really hope you're using something to keep yourself safe.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:14.900]  If you're using a respirator, now is the time to check those cartridges.
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:16.260]  How long have they been on there?
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:18.080]  Is it time to replace them?
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:20.300]  Is that respirator clean?
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:24.140]  Maybe it's time to watch a Google video and learn how to properly clean and take care
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:25.220]  of your respirator.
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:27.900]  That thing is going to save your life over time.
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:28.900]  Take care of that.
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:31.420]  Also, it's a good time to replace your gloves.
[01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:33.060]  Do you need more nitrile gloves?
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:35.180]  Do you need more Tyvek suits?
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:39.980]  Now is a really good time to make a list and go to the grow store and stock up on those
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:40.980]  types of items.
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:44.100]  All right, so we've got the grow room nice and clean.
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:46.180]  We have checked all of our safety precautions.
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:48.840]  We've refilled all of the necessary supplies.
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:53.920]  Now is a good time to do a quick inventory of your pesticides and nutrients and any accessories
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:54.960]  you think you may need.
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:59.000]  If you're going to need pesticides or nutrients, start ordering that stuff now so that when
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.680]  you move your plants back into the room, you have got all of the nutrients and all of the
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:06.640]  supplies you need so that you don't miss a day of the grow cycle.
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:07.920]  We've got everything cleaned up.
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:09.760]  We've checked out all of our safety equipment.
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:12.400]  We've restocked all of our personal protective equipment.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:13.920]  We've reordered all of our nutrients.
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:19.400]  Now if we didn't have any problems with pests or powdery mildew, it is time to start running
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:22.920]  that room and get it prepared for the next cycle.
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:27.640]  Now if you did have pests or problems, there are a couple of more steps that we need to
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:28.640]  take.
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:30.360]  We need to clean this room thoroughly.
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:32.660]  We need to spray it with some products.
[01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:35.760]  We might want to go a little harder with the bleach water.
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:38.480]  We might want to go a little harder with some Fizan.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:41.720]  You might want to get a product called Pro-Cure.
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:44.920]  If you had powdery mildew, you're going to want to spray something to get rid of the
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:47.620]  spores in that room.
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:51.840]  If you had bugs, I would recommend spraying some sort of pesticide through the entire
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:52.920]  room.
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:55.840]  Just mix up your pesticide sprayer, your pump sprayer.
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:58.280]  If you don't have one, go get one from Lowe's.
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:55:59.280]  Get a good one.
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:02.160]  Get a deck sprayer that can handle bleach because you're going to be putting some chemicals
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:03.160]  in here.
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:04.160]  They're not that expensive.
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:08.040]  You just need one that holds about a gallon, maybe two gallons of water.
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:09.860]  Fill it up with water.
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:14.060]  Put your cleaning product in there, whether it's Fizan, whether it's Pro-Cure, whether
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:15.520]  it's a bunch of bleach.
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:18.780]  Maybe you want to use granulated sulfur if you had a PM issue.
[01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:19.860]  Mix that up.
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:22.000]  Spray the shit out of the entire room.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.100]  This is your best opportunity to spray everything and eliminate your problem.
[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:29.260]  There are no plants in there, so you can use products that you wouldn't spray when you've
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:30.740]  got plants in there.
[01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:33.220]  Get in there and clean the shit out of the room.
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:36.160]  I would start with the normal cleaning I recommended.
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:40.380]  Take everything down and clean it, then put it back up, then set up the room.
[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:44.800]  Before you put the plants in there, go in there with this extra hard commando cleaning
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:47.560]  spray and go really hard, you guys.
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:51.280]  You got to get all of the bugs out of there or you're just going to bring plants in there
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:54.700]  and they're going to get bugs or they're going to get PM and you're going to have another
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:56.200]  struggling harvest.
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:59.640]  Nobody likes to struggle through a harvest.
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:00.800]  We've taken everything apart.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:02.160]  We've cleaned the shit out of the room.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:03.280]  We've replaced the bulbs.
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:05.360]  We've replaced all of our filters.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:07.400]  We have calibrated all of our equipment.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.240]  We've got new protective equipment.
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:11.040]  We have tested our safety equipment.
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:12.720]  We've put the room back together.
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:15.240]  We've gone in there and done another final spray.
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:17.100]  Maybe we hit it with Fizen.
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:21.240]  Maybe we sprayed Pro-Cure on everything to try to get rid of our problems.
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:24.920]  Maybe we just sprayed bleach water, real hot bleach water in there.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.760]  Maybe we went in there with some H2O2.
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:28.040]  That would work really well also.
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:32.000]  But if you use any type of products like that, you guys, make sure you wear personal protective
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.460]  equipment, some goggles, and a respirator.
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.100]  You don't want to spray bleach.
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:37.860]  You don't want to spray H2O2.
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:41.420]  You don't want to spray Fizen without some sort of protective equipment.
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:44.660]  That shit will be terrible for your eyes, terrible for your skin.
[01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:45.940]  Please take care of yourself.
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:52.180]  And if you're using a sprayer to spray anything, please use some sort of respiratory protection,
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:53.180]  please.
[01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:57.300]  Now, once the room is put back together, here is something I suggest.
[01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:58.620]  I would turn on the lights.
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:00.020]  I would turn on your blowers.
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:01.340]  I would turn on the fans.
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:03.000]  I would turn on the air conditioner.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.200]  And I would let everything run for a few minutes, and I would stand in the room and
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:07.460]  pay attention.
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:08.560]  Is there anything wrong?
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:09.960]  Is there anything you could dial in?
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.120]  Is there anything you could adjust?
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:14.000]  Do it while you're in there.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.960]  Then go outside and walk around your grow space.
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:20.660]  If your grow is at your house, just go walk around the house.
[01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:24.440]  Just go pick up trash around the house or whatever, and see if you can identify any
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:25.440]  light leaks.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:27.840]  Do you see light coming out of your grow room?
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:31.640]  If you see light coming out, there is light going in.
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:35.320]  We do not want and cannot have light leaks in our grow room.
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:36.840]  So walk around the house.
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.160]  Walk around the perimeter.
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:40.400]  Identify any possible light leaks.
[01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:41.960]  Also, listen.
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:43.280]  Do you hear the blowers?
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:44.280]  Do you hear the fans?
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:46.320]  Do you hear your air conditioner?
[01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:51.440]  Is anything outside making it obvious that you're running a grow in that house?
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:55.840]  This is a good time to discover that we've got light leaks or that we've got noisy equipment
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:57.520]  so that we don't get ourselves in trouble.
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:00.280]  You do not want to attract law enforcement.
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:01.920]  It may be legal where you grow.
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.280]  It is legal where I grow.
[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:06.960]  I am still stealth because you know who's worse than law enforcement?
[01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:08.280]  Fucking thieves.
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:13.740]  You don't want people to know you've got a grow in your house because somebody may come
[01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:17.240]  and take your crop from you.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:18.760]  That is a real thing.
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:19.760]  Keep that in mind.
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:23.240]  You have to be careful even in a legal state.
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:25.160]  Keep your grow stealth.
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:27.280]  So walk around outside.
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:29.840]  Look, listen, smell.
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:30.960]  Pay attention.
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:34.280]  See if anything is going wrong outside.
[01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:39.120]  Once you're sure that everything is fine outside, that's when you can go back in the grow room,
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:43.200]  turn off the lights in the grow room, and stand in there for about 10 minutes.
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:44.880]  Let your eyes adjust.
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:48.680]  Now is the time to find out if any light is leaking into the grow.
[01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:54.240]  Now is the time to find out if the sunshine from outside is coming through your ducts
[01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:58.260]  for your vented hoods right into your light reflectors into your grow room and shining
[01:59:58.260 --> 02:00:00.940]  light on your plants during a dark period.
[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:02.660]  Now is the time to find that out.
[02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:06.140]  Now the catch to these last two things, you're only going to be able to tell if you have
[02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:10.360]  a light leak outside if you go walk around the house and it's dark outside.
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:14.940]  The only way you can tell if you have a light leak inside is if it's light outside and you
[02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:19.220]  go in the grow room and you turn off the lights on the inside of the grow room.
[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:21.620]  So you're going to have to find the time of day to do that.
[02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:26.020]  You're going to have to do some investigating and some inspecting, but these are very important
[02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:28.100]  details to not overlook.
[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:30.220]  Make sure your grow room is lightproof.
[02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:32.620]  Make sure there's not a lot of noise coming out of there.
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:38.180]  And also find out if you've got too much aroma and correct it if you do.
[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:41.660]  You don't want to attract attention that you don't need.
[02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:45.460]  Once you've been growing for a while, or if you're somebody who is looking for grows,
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:47.860]  so say myself, I've been growing for a long time.
[02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:52.020]  When I used to go walk my dog in my neighborhood, I would always discover a new grow.
[02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:53.020]  I would go a different route.
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:56.340]  I'd go two blocks that way, three blocks that way, a block that way, and then I'd come back
[02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:58.460]  and then the next day I'd just do a different pattern.
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:03.100]  I would always find a new grow about once a week because I know what I'm looking for,
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:04.660]  listening for, and smelling for.
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:05.660]  I know the details.
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:07.100]  I know the clues.
[02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:10.460]  If I hear your weird blower at three in the morning going, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom,
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:14.020]  vroom, vroom, from your basement window, chances are you got a grow in there.
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:18.460]  If you've got an air conditioner in your basement window in the middle of winter, chances are
[02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:19.700]  there's a grow in there.
[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:24.100]  If you've got one window by the basement that has no snow and the rest of the backyard is
[02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:25.900]  snowy, there's a grow in there.
[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:30.340]  If there's one spot on your roof above one bedroom that there's no snow on it, there's
[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:31.340]  a grow in there.
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:34.260]  There are really easy signs that give it away.
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:38.740]  So pay attention, you guys, because if I can see it, law enforcement can see it, and so
[02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:39.820]  can the thieves.
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:41.580]  So be careful with your grow.
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:44.700]  Try to stay stealth even in legal states.
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:46.180]  There's no reason to brag.
[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:47.500]  There's no reason to set bait.
[02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:53.180]  All right, Podcast World, I feel like that is a pretty good clean and reset episode.
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:56.100]  Hopefully I mentioned some details that you would have overlooked.
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:01:58.820]  Hopefully I rescued you through a couple of pitfalls.
[02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:01.420]  Now you don't have to make those mistakes.
[02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:05.220]  Hopefully everything was well in your grow and you don't have any problems.
[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:07.580]  Hopefully you don't have anything funky to deal with.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:11.740]  Also, now that the grow is nice and clean, let's fucking keep it clean.
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:15.900]  Let's get in there with a mop and a broom every day if we need to, and mop and sweep
[02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:16.900]  that bitch.
[02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:19.740]  Let's get in there with a shop vac and suck out, you know that shit in the corner you've
[02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:20.780]  been looking at?
[02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:22.540]  Get the fucking shop vac and vac that out.
[02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:24.540]  It's not going to shop vac itself.
[02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:27.260]  That's a great place for a spider mite to hang out.
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:29.940]  That's a great place for some aphids to hang out and breed.
[02:02:29.940 --> 02:02:32.500]  That's a great place for some powdery mildew to start.
[02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:34.460]  That is just a vector for a problem.
[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:37.620]  So now that you've got it nice and clean, don't be lazy.
[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:40.620]  Get in there and clean it as often as you can.
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:45.780]  They say that cleanliness is godliness, and I think that most applies in kitchens and
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:46.860]  grow rooms, you guys.
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:48.340]  So clean up that grow room.
[02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:50.460]  Give yourself a nice, clean environment.
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:52.180]  Give your plants a nice, healthy start.
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:56.100]  I think your plants will be more comfortable, and I think you will also notice working in
[02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:59.780]  a cleaner, more organized environment will make you happier.
[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:01.780]  It'll make you faster and more productive.
[02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:05.580]  And shit, now that you're done cleaning up the grow room, why don't you clean up all
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:06.580]  your supplies?
[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:08.300]  Go organize your nutrients.
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:12.300]  Go organize the pesticides, the measuring devices, your cleaning supplies.
[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:15.780]  Go write down a list of anything that you can need, anything that you're low on.
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:17.220]  Go get yourself organized.
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:21.860]  Also, get a notebook and start making detailed notes.
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:24.420]  Start documenting when you changed your bulb.
[02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:27.180]  Start documenting when you changed your carbon filter.
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:31.400]  Start documenting the last time you changed your air conditioner filters and calibrated
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.460]  your meters.
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:35.140]  Start writing that stuff down so that when something comes up, you can look in there
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:37.700]  and go, oh, that's why my pH meter isn't working.
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:40.140]  I haven't calibrated the fucking thing in two months.
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:44.340]  You may find some things you were slipping on if you start taking more notes.
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:45.740]  All right, podcast world.
[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:49.780]  I feel like that pretty much wraps up my clean and reset the grow room episode.
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:51.260]  I want to thank you guys for listening.
[02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:53.500]  Thanks for hanging out with me for another episode.

[02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:14.100]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Mama Bear Dabs.

[02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:49.300]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:56.780]  This is Doug Benson and you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:01.060]  Welcome back, Cannabis World.
[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:04.660]  It is time for episode 395 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:07.500]  This episode is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:08.820]  That's right, Oregon Elite Seeds.
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:13.540]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds and you can find
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:18.580]  them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:22.300]  You know I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[02:07:22.300 --> 02:07:25.580]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Gelato Cake Batter.
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:27.820]  This is from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:34.340]  The label says it is 62.2% THC and 73.4% total cannabinoids.
[02:07:34.340 --> 02:07:36.340]  This stuff tastes delicious.
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:39.220]  It has a really unique, funky aroma.
[02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:41.340]  I can't find the right words to describe it.
[02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:47.740]  It is gross, it is funky, and it is sweet, spicy, and sour, and delicious all at the same time.
[02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:50.900]  I really can't get enough of the Gelato Cake Batter.
[02:07:50.900 --> 02:07:52.420]  The aroma is remarkable.
[02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:54.020]  The flavor is incredible.
[02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:55.700]  And the buzz is beautiful.
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:59.580]  It's got me nice and high and it's got my eyes kind of droopy and I've got the best
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:00.900]  cotton mouth right now.
[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:01.900]  It is delicious.
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:05.580]  So, big shout out to all of my friends at Apothecary Farms.
[02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:08.420]  Thank you for the great Gelato Cake Batter.
[02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:10.260]  All right, Podcast World.
[02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:15.020]  If you have been following along, you know that I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:18.220]  In a previous episode, I mentioned that those lessons were over.
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:19.980]  Well, I was wrong.
[02:08:19.980 --> 02:08:25.380]  Since that time, I realized I left out a very crucial part of our grow experience.
[02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:28.700]  We started off by making a solid plan for our grow.
[02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:30.020]  We thought out our equipment.
[02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:31.900]  We thought out our space very well.
[02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:33.420]  We thought out our genetics.
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:36.780]  Hopefully, we successfully ran a full garden cycle.
[02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:37.780]  We have harvested.
[02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:40.020]  We have dried and cured that product.
[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:42.260]  We've got some beautifully trimmed up buds.
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:43.980]  You know the one thing I left out?
[02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:45.460]  We never smoked this product.
[02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:49.460]  So, this episode is going to be the smoke that shit episode.
[02:08:49.460 --> 02:08:50.780]  We've ran a full garden.
[02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:54.260]  Let's reward ourselves and enjoy our finished product.
[02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:56.540]  There's really nothing like smoking your own product.
[02:08:56.540 --> 02:08:59.500]  Any flowers that you've grown, harvested, trimmed, you spent a bunch of time with it,
[02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:01.300]  you've really got some attachment to it.
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:05.980]  There's really a rewarding feeling that comes with smoking a crop that you grew.
[02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:07.260]  I've been growing for quite a while.
[02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:09.780]  I've grown many, many small personal crops.
[02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:12.580]  I have grown many large commercial crops.
[02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:15.660]  I have done a lot of pheno hunts of plants that I have bred.
[02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:17.500]  I have grown a lot of plants.
[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:22.780]  It is still very exciting to me to get to try the first little batch of smoke from each
[02:09:22.780 --> 02:09:23.780]  crop that I grow.
[02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:27.620]  There's something very rewarding and very satisfying and very fun.
[02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:28.860]  It feels like a kid inside.
[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:30.380]  It's like a kid on Christmas morning.
[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:32.020]  I get to try my new thing.
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:33.020]  Let's see what it's like.
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:36.020]  I spent all this time with it, and I finally get to enjoy it.
[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:40.060]  Every time I do it, especially something that I've just bred and it's his first run
[02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:41.060]  with it.
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:45.020]  I bred something, I made some seeds, I grew those seeds out, I pheno hunted those seeds,
[02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:47.220]  and now I finally have a finished product.
[02:09:47.220 --> 02:09:49.260]  That is real satisfaction to me.
[02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:51.380]  There's nothing like that feeling.
[02:09:51.380 --> 02:09:54.500]  This may be your first time getting to enjoy this experience.
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:56.900]  I want this to be a great experience for you.
[02:09:56.900 --> 02:10:00.900]  I want every harvest to be a wonderful experience for you.
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:05.500]  There's one thing that can really ruin your experience when it comes to testing your cannabis
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:06.940]  for the first time.
[02:10:06.940 --> 02:10:10.540]  The one thing that can really fuck it up is by being impatient.
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:15.060]  If you cut down your plants too early, they aren't going to be the quality you deserve.
[02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:19.580]  If you dried and cured your plants in a rushing manner, you are not going to get the quality
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:21.060]  that you deserve.
[02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:24.300]  So make sure those plants got to finish.
[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:26.260]  Make sure your plants were flushed.
[02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:30.900]  Make sure they were harvested, dried, and cured and trimmed correctly.
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:36.020]  Let's not try to smoke our first crop too early and put a bad taste in our mouth, literally,
[02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:37.020]  about our new crop.
[02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:40.380]  You're going to take a bud, you're going to dry it fast, you're going to try to smoke
[02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:43.540]  it, it's going to taste like shit, and you're going to feel like shit about your whole crop.
[02:10:43.540 --> 02:10:45.620]  You're going to have just a bad feeling about it.
[02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:50.380]  You spent all this time, be patient, let each bud be ready before you smoke them.
[02:10:50.380 --> 02:10:54.900]  So the first thing we need to test before we get down to smoking this product is, is
[02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:55.900]  it ready?
[02:10:55.900 --> 02:10:56.900]  Is it dry enough?
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:11:01.260]  Are we going to get dried and cured this product properly before we go putting it in a grinder
[02:11:01.260 --> 02:11:03.860]  and try to roll it up or put it in a pipe?
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:09.540]  It is acceptable for cured herb to be kind of sticky and a little bit moist.
[02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:11.700]  That is the way a lot of people like it.
[02:11:11.700 --> 02:11:15.140]  You don't get a lot of that in the Colorado area because we have what is known as the
[02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:16.500]  Colorado crunch here.
[02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:21.300]  And I do plan to do a podcast all about the Colorado crunch in the future, but let's stay
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:22.300]  focused.
[02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:24.700]  Let's talk about your dried and cured herb before we smoke it.
[02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:25.860]  It may be a little spongy.
[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:27.340]  It may be a little sticky.
[02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:30.100]  If you have cured it properly, that is okay.
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:34.620]  You may need to take a couple of nugs out of the jar and set them on the table for three,
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:38.620]  four, maybe five or six hours before you decide to smoke.
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:45.220]  It is not uncommon to see a connoisseur smoker pull out his jar of nugs, crack the lid, take
[02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:49.560]  out three or four nuggets, set them on the table, seal the jar up, put it back in his
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:53.900]  little stash spot, and then leave those nuggets on the table throughout the day.
[02:11:54.100 --> 02:11:56.460]  And that's what we smoke on as the day goes by.
[02:11:56.460 --> 02:12:00.580]  They may be a little bit damp as soon as we pull them out of the jar, but as the day goes
[02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:05.780]  on, they're going to dry out perfectly to roll a fat joint and pack a couple of bowls.
[02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:12.740]  So make sure your herb is cured and dry enough to burn properly so you don't disappoint yourself
[02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:15.080]  with your first experience.
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:19.340]  Now if you're confident that your buds are dried and cured and ready for consumption,
[02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:23.620]  let's talk about taking that first taste test of our new crop.
[02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:28.220]  For me, testing a new product is sort of a combination between a science experiment
[02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:29.540]  and a ritual.
[02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:31.580]  I like to be in my environment.
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:33.460]  I like to use my equipment.
[02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:35.060]  I like to know what to expect.
[02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:36.960]  I like to take away variables.
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:40.620]  That way I can see what the actual product is telling me.
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:45.340]  Now I know that may sound weird to some people, but a lot of stoners are very ritualistic.
[02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:48.100]  And by ritualistic, I don't mean some fancy ceremony.
[02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:50.380]  I just mean I like to be in a certain place.
[02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:51.620]  I like to be right here.
[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:53.580]  This is my comfortable smoking place.
[02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:57.420]  If you gave me a new concentrate, if you gave me some flour and you said, hey, I want
[02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:03.300]  you to judge this or rate this, this would be the best place for me to conduct that experiment
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:05.700]  so that I could give you a proper review.
[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:06.940]  This is where I'm comfortable.
[02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:08.180]  I know that the door is locked.
[02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:09.780]  I know I can consume safely here.
[02:13:09.780 --> 02:13:11.520]  I know that nobody can bother me here.
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:13.280]  I can control the environment here.
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:14.940]  I can control the music here.
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:18.940]  This is a great place for myself to consume any type of cannabis product.
[02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:19.940]  I'm comfortable here.
[02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:20.940]  Nothing could go wrong.
[02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:21.940]  There's a couch over there.
[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:23.180]  There's a bed about 50 feet away.
[02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:24.780]  There's snacks in the fridge.
[02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:25.780]  I'm set up here.
[02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:26.780]  I'm really comfortable.
[02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:27.780]  Also, I've got my little chair.
[02:13:27.780 --> 02:13:28.780]  This is my zone.
[02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:29.780]  I got my drinks right here in front of me.
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:31.980]  I got the computer so I could browse the internet.
[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.260]  I've got my next step in this talk is my equipment.
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:38.500]  I've got all my favorite smoking equipment just to the right of me.
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:39.900]  My favorite pipe is here.
[02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:41.300]  My favorite dab rig is here.
[02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:45.980]  All my tools to keep those things in proper smoking condition, they're all right here.
[02:13:45.980 --> 02:13:48.780]  So part of the ritual is being in the right place.
[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:50.340]  You've probably got that little place.
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:51.420]  It's your little chair.
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:53.160]  It's that little spot on your bed.
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:56.240]  Everybody's got that one little cozy spot where they want to chill and smoke.
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:58.160]  So get in your little cozy place.
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:13:59.160]  Get comfy.
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:00.160]  Put on the music that you like.
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:01.760]  Get the air the way you like it.
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:02.960]  Be in your right place.
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:04.980]  Also, get your favorite piece.
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:06.640]  Maybe you've got that favorite bong.
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:08.320]  Maybe you've got that favorite dab rig.
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:10.160]  Maybe you've got that favorite pipe.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:11.400]  Find your favorite piece.
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:13.240]  Be in your comfort zone.
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:17.880]  Also, maybe there are certain people you do or don't like to smoke around.
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:21.920]  Do you want to smoke your crop for the first time by yourself or do you want to make it
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:25.640]  fun and bring your friends along and be like, bro, check out what I smoked.
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:27.480]  Let's try it together for the first time.
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:29.600]  It's always fun to have your friends around.
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:31.640]  Also, that puts you on the spot.
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:35.240]  Maybe you smoke it and it tastes like you just stuck your tongue in a light socket and
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:38.120]  everyone's going to get to smoke that with you and experience it.
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:39.120]  That's a learning experience.
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:40.320]  Just be honest.
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:41.700]  Go ahead and share it with your friends.
[02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:42.700]  See what everybody thinks.
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:46.000]  We're going to talk more about that reaction in just a minute.
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  Another thing that is really fun to involve your friends in is if you do a pheno hunt.
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:54.480]  If you grew five seeds, you've probably got five different phenotypes or maybe two or
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:57.940]  three different phenotypes to select from out of those five.
[02:14:57.940 --> 02:15:02.240]  It's always fun to load up five bowls or roll five joints and label them somehow right on
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:03.240]  the end of the filter.
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:06.820]  Write number one, number two, or just remember and then smoke them with your friends and
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:10.920]  see if you guys like plant number one, plant number two, plant number three better.
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:14.700]  See if different people in the room like number one or number three better.
[02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:18.320]  Maybe everybody in the room says, bro, number five was amazing.
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:22.200]  It's always fun to bring your friends around to consume with you to see what you have just
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:23.200]  done.
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:25.600]  Do you want your first try, your ritual?
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:29.360]  Do you want that to happen with friends around or do you want that to be a little isolated
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:30.360]  situation?
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:31.360]  I could go both ways.
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:35.300]  In my little comfort zone right here, there are two chairs right in front of me where
[02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:36.840]  Mike is always invited.
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:38.400]  Kevin likes to take this spot right here.
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:40.240]  There are several other folks that come over and smoke.
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:41.520]  They're always invited.
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:42.520]  That's always fun to me.
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:44.800]  I've got a couple other chairs we can pull out if it gets crowded.
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:46.120]  I like to smoke with friends.
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:48.560]  I don't know if you want to smoke your first crop with friends.
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:49.560]  You may be timid.
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:50.560]  You may be shy.
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:52.840]  That may not be your thing, but think about that.
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:55.080]  Do you want some friends around?
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:59.280]  Another thing I recommend when you come to sampling your new product is make it your
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:02.220]  first smoke of the day.
[02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:03.840]  Don't smoke anything before that.
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:05.380]  Don't eat any edibles before that.
[02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:07.200]  Go in totally sober.
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:12.400]  Go in fresh so that you know exactly what your product has done to you.
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:13.640]  So let me back up a couple of steps.
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:14.840]  I've gotten ahead of myself.
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:17.600]  Let's start off by grinding up our product.
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:21.640]  Once you are in your comfortable spot with your people, with your music plan, with a
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:26.200]  drink on hand, and you're ready to rock, the first couple of things to consuming your new
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:28.740]  flowers are a visual inspection.
[02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:29.880]  Let's take a look at it.
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:31.120]  Let's look and see what we've done.
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:33.440]  Let's enjoy the beauty of this product.
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:34.960]  What colors do you see?
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:35.960]  Did you trim it well?
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:38.680]  Could you trim it better next time by looking at it?
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:39.920]  How do the trichomes look?
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:41.160]  Is that plant real frosty?
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:42.720]  Is it just kind of frosty?
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:43.840]  Give it a nice look.
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:44.840]  Enjoy it.
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:45.840]  Smell it.
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:46.840]  Hold it up to your face.
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:47.840]  Give it a nice smell.
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:48.840]  Enjoy that.
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:49.840]  It is yours.
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:50.840]  You put a lot of work into it.
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:53.000]  I think the next step is to give it a little bit of a squeeze.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.840]  Yeah, you may break it up a little bit.
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:55.840]  That's fine.
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:57.200]  We're about to put this in a grinder and smoke it.
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:59.760]  We can destroy this, but it is yours.
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:00.760]  Enjoy it.
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:02.320]  So I'd give it a little squeeze.
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:03.320]  How moist is it?
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:04.860]  Do you think it's ready to smoke?
[02:17:04.860 --> 02:17:05.860]  Is that ready?
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:07.760]  Are you going to embarrass yourself by trying to put that in the pipe?
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:10.240]  Do you really need just another day or two of curing that?
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:12.740]  Or does it need to sit on the table for a couple of hours?
[02:17:12.740 --> 02:17:13.740]  Is it ready?
[02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:16.220]  It's your last chance before you grind it up in front of your friends.
[02:17:16.220 --> 02:17:17.220]  So make sure.
[02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:18.220]  How does it feel in your hand?
[02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:19.220]  Is it real sticky?
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:22.860]  Now that you've played with it a little bit, smell the inside of the bud.
[02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:23.860]  Smell your fingers.
[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:24.900]  How does that smell?
[02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:29.700]  Try to absorb and enjoy all of this stuff, especially if it's your first crop.
[02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:33.660]  And if this is like your thousandth crop, slow down for a minute.
[02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:35.140]  Stop and smell the flowers.
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:38.060]  This is one of the most rewarding parts of the entire process.
[02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:39.380]  We've done a lot of work.
[02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:40.980]  Let's enjoy this stuff.
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:43.300]  Let's not think too much about how much did we harvest?
[02:17:43.860 --> 02:17:44.860]  What does it weigh?
[02:17:44.860 --> 02:17:45.860]  What is it worth?
[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:48.220]  Let's enjoy the actual flowers that we have grown.
[02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:52.980]  Let's enjoy the effort we made that turned into a consumable product that is beautiful,
[02:17:52.980 --> 02:17:59.020]  that has a great aroma to it, that is a work of art and nature and science all put together
[02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:00.220]  that you did.
[02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:01.220]  Take a moment.
[02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:02.220]  Enjoy that shit.
[02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:03.500]  So smell it.
[02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:04.500]  Break it up.
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:05.540]  Smell your fingers.
[02:18:05.540 --> 02:18:08.300]  Now it is time to put it in a grinder.
[02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:12.220]  When you put it in the grinder and give it a couple of turns, if that grinder is really
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:15.340]  hard to spin, your buds may be too wet.
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:18.980]  When you open up that grinder, if it's a little moist in there, you'll be able to tell at
[02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:20.020]  this point.
[02:18:20.020 --> 02:18:23.940]  If that one bud is a little bit too wet, you still need to let the rest of the buds dry
[02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:26.380]  and cure just a little bit longer.
[02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:27.380]  Don't worry.
[02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:30.580]  You can dry them a little bit more and you will be just fine.
[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:34.180]  Now if you feel like the bud that you have ground up is ready to consume, let's talk
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:35.380]  about consuming it.
[02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:36.500]  How do you want to smoke it?
[02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:37.620]  What is your favorite way?
[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:39.780]  I spoke earlier about your favorite piece.
[02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:40.780]  Are you going to roll a joint?
[02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:42.420]  Are you a joint kind of a person?
[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:44.060]  Are you a bong kind of a person?
[02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:45.060]  Are you a pipe kind of a person?
[02:18:45.060 --> 02:18:46.900]  Are you going to throw it in the vaporizer?
[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:48.220]  How do you want to do it?
[02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:49.220]  That is up to you.
[02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:51.580]  Please, please, you can do it however you want.
[02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:55.320]  It's your herb, but please for me, don't wrap it up in a blunt wrap.
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:58.460]  You just spent so much time growing the most delicious herb.
[02:18:58.460 --> 02:18:59.460]  You dried it and cured it.
[02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:01.580]  Why are you going to wrap it up in a paper bag?
[02:19:01.580 --> 02:19:05.980]  I am all about smoking a fat joint, but I do not appreciate smoking a blunt.
[02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:08.500]  If you're going to roll it up, get yourself some good papers.
[02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:13.380]  Get something like some raws, some elements, something quality, but please for this first
[02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:16.100]  test, please don't roll it up in a blunt.
[02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:19.260]  Since we're on this subject, if you're going to pack a bowl, clean your pipe.
[02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:20.500]  You've got some fresh herb.
[02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:21.900]  You've got your friends over.
[02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:25.900]  You want to impress yourself and your friends the best you can with this new herb, so clean
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:26.900]  your pipe.
[02:19:26.900 --> 02:19:31.080]  If you're smoking through the bong, dude, clean the bong and change the bong water.
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:34.580]  You wouldn't believe how many places I go to smoke a bong load and the water looks like
[02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:36.780]  muck and I will not smoke a bowl.
[02:19:36.780 --> 02:19:40.660]  Just change the bong water, clean your piece, and everybody will enjoy it much more and
[02:19:40.660 --> 02:19:42.920]  it will make your product taste much better.
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:46.740]  We're trying to impress everybody, you guys, so let's do the best we can to make your product
[02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:48.540]  taste the best that it can.
[02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:50.220]  All right, so you ground up your herb.
[02:19:50.220 --> 02:19:51.860]  You've got a fat joint rolled.
[02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:53.380]  You've got a bong load packed.
[02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:55.340]  You've got a pipe loaded.
[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:56.840]  Maybe you filled up the vaporizer.
[02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:58.660]  Maybe you've got a volcano bag going on.
[02:19:58.660 --> 02:20:04.820]  However you decided to do it, now it is time to take our first puff of our freshly dried
[02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:07.100]  and cured cannabis crop.
[02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:10.380]  Like I said earlier, I recommend this being your first puff of the day.
[02:20:10.380 --> 02:20:14.040]  That way you know exactly what your herb does to you.
[02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:17.660]  We have now come to my favorite part of the entire process.
[02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:23.740]  It is now time to smoke the first sample of our newly harvested crop.
[02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:26.500]  So if you rolled up a joint, now's the time to spark it up.
[02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:29.900]  If you packed up a bowl, now's the time to start taking a couple of puffs.
[02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:34.060]  If you've got the vaporizer going, now's the time to start taking a couple of pulls.
[02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:37.500]  Take a couple of pulls, a couple of draws, a couple of tokes off your new product and
[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:41.980]  sit back for a couple of seconds and let it sit in and see what it does to you.
[02:20:41.980 --> 02:20:45.660]  I don't know how much you consume, but depending on your consumption level, you should probably
[02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:49.540]  be able to take two, three, maybe four good draws of whatever you're smoking on.
[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:51.660]  If you're smoking a joint, maybe two or three good draws.
[02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:55.260]  If you're smoking a bowl, maybe two or three, maybe three or four good puffs off of that.
[02:20:55.260 --> 02:20:58.160]  If you're hitting the bong, hopefully you only need one or two good bong rips before
[02:20:58.160 --> 02:20:59.580]  you start feeling it.
[02:20:59.580 --> 02:21:01.460]  I find vaporizers to be unpredictable.
[02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:05.500]  I never know if I'm going to need one or six pulls off the vaporizer, but take as many
[02:21:05.500 --> 02:21:09.900]  as you're comfortable with, get a little buzz on and sit back for a couple of seconds and
[02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:11.300]  just see what happens.
[02:21:11.300 --> 02:21:12.300]  Are you stoned?
[02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:13.300]  Did you get mellow?
[02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:14.300]  Did you get low?
[02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:15.300]  Are you high?
[02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:16.620]  Did you get giggly and goofy?
[02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:17.620]  Are you paranoid?
[02:21:17.620 --> 02:21:18.620]  Do you have the munchies?
[02:21:18.620 --> 02:21:19.620]  How do you feel?
[02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:21.480]  Give it a couple of seconds.
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:24.000]  If you've got other friends in the room, start conversation.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.500]  You guys will start talking about the product.
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:27.220]  You'll start talking about the herb.
[02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:28.740]  Somebody will mention the taste.
[02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:30.820]  Somebody will mention the aroma.
[02:21:30.820 --> 02:21:31.820]  And we'll start.
[02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:35.060]  Pay attention to how your friends react to your herb.
[02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:37.620]  Make a mental note of what you think of the herb.
[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:38.620]  Do you like it?
[02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:39.620]  Do you like the aroma?
[02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:40.980]  Do you like the flavor?
[02:21:40.980 --> 02:21:44.480]  Do you like the buzz that you've gotten from the way you've consumed it?
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:48.600]  Now it may be time to take a couple of more puffs and go to the next level.
[02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:49.600]  Now what do you think?
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:52.100]  Now that you've pushed it a little bit, how do you feel?
[02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:53.100]  Now are you super stoned?
[02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:54.100]  Are you stuck to the couch?
[02:21:54.100 --> 02:21:57.340]  Are you flying off the couch and just hanging on for dear life?
[02:21:57.340 --> 02:21:58.820]  How is it making you feel?
[02:21:58.820 --> 02:22:00.340]  How is it acting to your friends?
[02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:01.340]  Are they lit?
[02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:02.340]  Are they bored?
[02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:03.340]  See how they're enjoying it?
[02:22:03.340 --> 02:22:07.140]  Pay attention to the words that they're saying and try to make a mental note of their review
[02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:09.020]  of your product.
[02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:13.140]  Now let's talk about a few things to look for while you are smoking your first sample.
[02:22:13.140 --> 02:22:16.900]  Let's look for some things about the product to pay attention to.
[02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:18.740]  How does your product burn?
[02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:19.740]  Does it burn smoothly?
[02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:21.520]  Did it burn like a charcoal briquette?
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:23.900]  Or did it burn a nice white ash?
[02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:27.140]  If the ash that you knocked off the end of your joint or that chunk that you dumped out
[02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:31.100]  of your bowl at the end, if that was chunky and black, you may not have flushed your product
[02:22:31.100 --> 02:22:32.100]  long enough.
[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:33.700]  You may want a longer flush time.
[02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:36.140]  Also, you may not have dried it properly.
[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:38.040]  It may still be a little bit wet.
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:42.660]  If it's not burning properly, it could still be a little moist and it needs more dry time.
[02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:44.900]  So pay attention to how it burns.
[02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:47.200]  Also, how does it smoke?
[02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:49.000]  Is the smoke nice and smooth?
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.220]  Is that smoke thick and harsh?
[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:52.220]  Does it hurt your throat?
[02:22:52.220 --> 02:22:53.580]  Does it make you cough?
[02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:57.560]  Or can you just toke on it all day and blow clouds and it doesn't bother your lungs and
[02:22:57.560 --> 02:22:58.660]  throat at all?
[02:22:58.660 --> 02:22:59.740]  Pay attention to that.
[02:22:59.740 --> 02:23:05.200]  You can make improvements in your next grow based on the quality of this product.
[02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:06.380]  How is the flavor?
[02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:07.460]  How is the aroma?
[02:23:07.460 --> 02:23:09.040]  Are those things on point?
[02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:14.300]  Because if the flavor and aroma and burn factor are not on point, you can absolutely correct
[02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:16.840]  those in your next grow.
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:20.660]  I was talking about paying attention to what your friends say because they are going to
[02:23:20.660 --> 02:23:22.140]  be honest with you.
[02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:24.000]  You're going to be very proud of your crop.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.340]  You spent a lot of time on this.
[02:23:25.340 --> 02:23:28.140]  You're going to think it is the best herb you've ever smoked.
[02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:32.380]  That is a very natural thing for new growers to experience.
[02:23:32.380 --> 02:23:33.480]  Listen to your friends.
[02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:35.340]  They smoke a lot of herb also.
[02:23:35.340 --> 02:23:38.740]  They're going to have very influential feedback.
[02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:41.180]  Don't let their criticism hurt your feelings.
[02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:42.820]  You're going to take their compliments.
[02:23:42.820 --> 02:23:45.500]  When one of your friends says, bro, this shit smells so good.
[02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:47.260]  I can't believe you grew this.
[02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:48.260]  You're going to glow.
[02:23:48.260 --> 02:23:51.280]  When the other guy says, bro, this kind of burns my throat.
[02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:56.880]  You have to take that compliment just as strongly as you did or that criticism as strongly as
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:58.120]  you did that compliment.
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:00.740]  They both matter equally.
[02:24:00.740 --> 02:24:03.840]  Use the compliment as a driving force to move you forward.
[02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:07.760]  Use the criticism as a way to improve your crop next time.
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:10.680]  Don't be hurt when one of your friends says, bro, that weed burns my throat.
[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:13.040]  That's because you did something wrong and you need to improve.
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:15.840]  He was honest with you because he's a good friend.
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:19.200]  I mentioned earlier that some of the things that you may need to improve that you'll notice
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:21.200]  right away are your flush.
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:22.360]  How is that product burning?
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:26.360]  Again, is it a dark chunk or is it a nice white clean ash?
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:29.840]  Does it burn all the way through the joint or do you need to keep relighting it?
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:33.600]  If it's burning real black and chunky and you need to keep relighting it, you probably
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:35.300]  need it to flush longer.
[02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:39.240]  If it just keeps going out, but it's not burning real black, it may just be too wet and you
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:42.720]  need to dry and cure it a little bit longer.
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:44.120]  How was your cure process?
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:45.600]  Does the herb taste good?
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:46.940]  Does it smell good?
[02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:47.940]  Is it crunchy?
[02:24:47.940 --> 02:24:48.940]  Is it dry?
[02:24:48.940 --> 02:24:49.940]  Is it moist?
[02:24:49.940 --> 02:24:51.660]  How do you dry and cure it to your liking?
[02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:54.580]  Do your friends think you dried and cured it properly?
[02:24:54.580 --> 02:24:55.580]  What do you think?
[02:24:55.580 --> 02:24:58.540]  As long as you're happy, that's what matters as long as you are consuming it.
[02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:03.460]  If it's going to market, it's got to satisfy the market, so pay attention to what the market
[02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:04.460]  says.
[02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:06.140]  Also, how did you trim it?
[02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:07.860]  Are you satisfied with the trim?
[02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:10.880]  Are your clients satisfied with the trim?
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:12.340]  Maybe you can improve on the trim.
[02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:16.340]  A lot of new growers don't trim enough, in my opinion.
[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:19.180]  You could go a little bit harder on your trim job.
[02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:22.620]  Now that you are consuming the product and you can actually tell what type of buzz it
[02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:26.700]  gives you, do you think you should have flowered a little bit longer or do you think you should
[02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:29.300]  have flowered a little bit shorter?
[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:33.460]  If you pay attention to the finished product and how things came out this time, if you
[02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:37.180]  took plenty of notes throughout the grow, you can look at your notes, you can look at
[02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:41.020]  your finished product and you can see things that you can improve for the next run, which
[02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:43.260]  will make you a better grower.
[02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:47.100]  Take all of those compliments and take all of that criticism and ball it all up into
[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:52.380]  one big learning lesson and think of ways to improve your crop next time.
[02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:56.300]  Now the overall deciding factor on the quality of this product is how do you feel?
[02:25:56.300 --> 02:25:57.420]  Do you like it?
[02:25:57.420 --> 02:26:01.900]  Were you going for a low couch lock kind of a buzz or were you going for a big psychedelic
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:05.240]  head spinning high and did you get what you were after?
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:08.820]  Do you think if you would have let that plant flower a little bit longer that you would
[02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:09.940]  have gotten better quality?
[02:26:09.940 --> 02:26:12.260]  Do you think maybe you would have gotten a fatter yield?
[02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:15.500]  Do you think maybe if you would have chopped it a little later that it may have started
[02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:16.780]  to diminish the flavor?
[02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:20.540]  Do you think if you would have cut it a little bit earlier that it would have been a little
[02:26:20.540 --> 02:26:23.140]  more head buzzy and a little bit racier?
[02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:26.060]  There are things to think about as you were testing the final product.
[02:26:26.060 --> 02:26:29.300]  Are you satisfied with your finished product is the bottom line.
[02:26:29.300 --> 02:26:31.780]  If you're satisfied, don't change a thing.
[02:26:31.780 --> 02:26:35.780]  If there are things that you're not satisfied with, look at your notes and think of ways
[02:26:35.780 --> 02:26:39.700]  that you can improve those things for your next run.
[02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:44.100]  Now I started off our little science experiment slash ritual of testing our first crop by
[02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:46.980]  sitting in our little comfortable environment.
[02:26:46.980 --> 02:26:51.620]  Cannabis consumers, stoners, potheads, whatever you want to call us, I'm okay with all of
[02:26:51.620 --> 02:26:52.860]  the above.
[02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:56.700]  We have this tendency to smoke and get trapped in our little spot.
[02:26:56.700 --> 02:26:57.700]  We don't want to go anywhere.
[02:26:57.700 --> 02:26:58.740]  We're nice and comfortable here.
[02:26:58.740 --> 02:27:00.900]  Like I said earlier, the music is just right.
[02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:02.620]  The air conditioner is just right.
[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:04.300]  The fridge is full of snacks.
[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:05.980]  My bros are right here at the table.
[02:27:05.980 --> 02:27:07.580]  Why would I want to go anywhere?
[02:27:07.580 --> 02:27:08.580]  Why?
[02:27:08.580 --> 02:27:12.500]  Because when you step out of this little comfort zone, you may be twice as stoned as you even
[02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:13.500]  noticed.
[02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:18.300]  It's really easy to smoke a whole bunch of product and sit here and be blazed out of
[02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:21.180]  your mind to be comfortable because this is the zone.
[02:27:21.180 --> 02:27:22.180]  You know where everything is.
[02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:23.180]  I know there's a drink right here.
[02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:24.180]  I know the dab rig is right here.
[02:27:24.180 --> 02:27:25.180]  I know the pen is right here.
[02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:26.660]  I know where everything is.
[02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:29.120]  There's no chaos right here.
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:30.120]  Maybe go somewhere.
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:31.240]  Go for a walk.
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:34.600]  Maybe call an Uber and have them take you to the mall or to the park.
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:35.600]  Just go somewhere.
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:36.700]  Just get out of the house.
[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:40.220]  Maybe just go get some food somewhere with your bros and just get out of the house while
[02:27:40.220 --> 02:27:44.540]  you're freshly buzzed on that fresh new product and see what kind of brand new experiences
[02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:46.740]  the world brings to you out there.
[02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:50.540]  There's this thing about stoners that once you smoke, you've got about 10 minutes.
[02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:53.900]  If you don't get up and leave in 10 minutes, you're fucking stuck wherever you just smoked.
[02:27:53.900 --> 02:27:55.860]  So smoke a little bit.
[02:27:55.860 --> 02:27:58.200]  If you're comfortable just hanging out at the house, do that.
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:27:59.420]  See what you experience.
[02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:04.020]  But next time, take a few puffs of that new product, call an Uber and go somewhere exciting
[02:28:04.020 --> 02:28:05.560]  and see what life brings you.
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:08.020]  You may get into some cool new adventures.
[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:09.020]  All right, podcast world.
[02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:13.340]  That does my talk about sampling and trying our freshly harvested cannabis crop.
[02:28:13.340 --> 02:28:14.780]  I hope you had as much fun as I did.
[02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:16.300]  I hope you learned something.
[02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:20.180]  If you found this episode educational, informative, or entertaining, and you would like to make
[02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:23.740]  a financial contribution to the show, I would appreciate your support.
[02:28:23.740 --> 02:28:28.420]  And you can help out by going to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[02:28:28.420 --> 02:28:32.740]  All the information you need to become a patron will be right there on the screen.
[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:36.820]  Just so you know, I use the funding from Patreon for things like keeping the website alive.
[02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:37.900]  I do host a website.
[02:28:37.900 --> 02:28:40.580]  I read geneticscolorado.com is my website.
[02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:42.580]  That is where the podcast is hosted.
[02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:45.460]  That's how I'm able to keep the podcast coming to you for free.
[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:48.620]  It does cost me a little bit of money to host the website every year.
[02:28:48.620 --> 02:28:51.660]  So I do pay for that out of the Patreon contributions.
[02:28:51.660 --> 02:28:56.940]  I also use last year's Patreon contributions to fund the MacBook that I am using to record
[02:28:56.940 --> 02:28:58.500]  the show on right now.
[02:28:58.500 --> 02:29:02.340]  I also use some of the Patreon funding for a little microphone covers and for equipment
[02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:03.340]  that breaks occasionally.
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:05.940]  I've had to replace this headphone amp a couple of times.
[02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:09.540]  I buy memory cards and things like that with the funding from Patreon.
[02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:13.820]  So it mainly pays for the podcast and the equipment and the little microphone covers.
[02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:17.940]  So I want to thank you guys for contributing to Patreon and I look forward to all of the
[02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:19.460]  future support.
[02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:23.660]  I would also appreciate it if you find me on all of the social media on Facebook, simply
[02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:26.380]  search for the grow from your heart podcast on Twitter.
[02:29:26.380 --> 02:29:28.120]  It's at GFYH podcast.

[02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:40.620]  That's my seed company.
[02:29:40.620 --> 02:29:43.820]  I post a lot of pictures of cannabis photography.
[02:29:43.820 --> 02:29:44.980]  I think you would enjoy it.
[02:29:44.980 --> 02:29:49.340]  I also go on Instagram live and I do live videos where I hang out with my friends.
[02:29:49.340 --> 02:29:51.940]  I talk about growing and I answer grow questions.
[02:29:51.940 --> 02:29:56.940]  So follow me on Instagram and catch my Instagram live videos and maybe I will answer your question
[02:29:56.940 --> 02:29:59.060]  in the live feed there.
[02:29:59.060 --> 02:30:02.300]  If you've got something to say and you're not into the social media, maybe you've got
[02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:06.140]  a question, maybe you've got a product you'd like me to review, perhaps you'd like to sponsor
[02:30:06.140 --> 02:30:07.140]  the show.
[02:30:07.140 --> 02:30:08.580]  You can reach out to me through email.
[02:30:08.580 --> 02:30:13.660]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com and I would love to hear from you.

[02:30:18.820 --> 02:30:23.820]  tune in radio, and of course you can find every episode on YouTube.
[02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:25.820]  I want to thank you once again for listening to this podcast.
[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:29.300]  I want to thank you again for listening to the long series of grow lessons.
[02:30:29.300 --> 02:30:31.980]  I hope you had as much fun as I did.
[02:30:32.020 --> 02:30:34.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be back in just a few days with fresh new content.
[02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:38.940]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Kelvin Medina and until next time, take a
[02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:41.820]  fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:30:41.820 --> 02:30:43.380]  Smoke weed everyday.
