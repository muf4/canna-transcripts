[00:14.780 --> 00:17.340]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:17.340 --> 00:19.140]  It's time for episode number 235
[00:19.140 --> 00:20.860]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:20.860 --> 00:23.900]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:24.900 --> 00:26.060]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:26.060 --> 00:27.220]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.220 --> 00:29.680]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.680 --> 00:31.020]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:31.020 --> 00:32.420]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:32.420 --> 00:34.180]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.180 --> 00:37.140]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.140 --> 00:39.020]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.020 --> 00:41.020]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.020 --> 00:43.220]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.220 --> 00:44.820]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:44.820 --> 00:47.180]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.180 --> 00:50.900]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:52.060 --> 00:54.880]  Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, I'm in a good mood today.
[00:54.880 --> 00:57.820]  I'm not exactly sure why, but I am not gonna question it.
[00:57.820 --> 00:59.780]  I'm just gonna go with it.
[00:59.780 --> 01:00.940]  It might have something to do
[01:00.940 --> 01:02.820]  with this Sour Joker live batter
[01:02.820 --> 01:04.380]  I just took a gigantic dab of.
[01:05.500 --> 01:06.620]  You know how much I love sativas.
[01:06.620 --> 01:08.580]  If you're a podcast listener and you listen to my show,
[01:08.580 --> 01:10.180]  you know that I love to smoke these sativas.
[01:10.180 --> 01:11.980]  And right now, the Sour Joker
[01:12.020 --> 01:13.340]  is doing something to my head.
[01:13.340 --> 01:14.180]  I enjoy it.
[01:15.580 --> 01:16.620]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:17.620 --> 01:19.940]  woo, let's let that dab sink in for a minute.
[01:19.940 --> 01:21.340]  I get to brag a little bit.
[01:21.340 --> 01:22.940]  On the last episode, I talked about going to see
[01:22.940 --> 01:24.620]  Steve Simone at Comedy Works.
[01:24.620 --> 01:27.580]  And let me tell you, it was better than I had anticipated.
[01:28.480 --> 01:30.700]  I drove up to Denver and I met up with the always lovely,
[01:30.700 --> 01:31.940]  always beautiful Miss Jenny Beth.
[01:31.940 --> 01:33.620]  She was in Denver doing some Denver stuff.
[01:33.620 --> 01:35.580]  Her and I met up, we hung out.
[01:35.580 --> 01:38.020]  We got, we might've got a little stone in a parking garage.
[01:38.020 --> 01:40.120]  We may have taken some ridiculous sized dabs
[01:40.920 --> 01:42.600]  before we went to see the show.
[01:42.600 --> 01:45.440]  So we got super dabbed out and we headed into Comedy Works.
[01:45.440 --> 01:47.560]  But on the way to Comedy Works, I tweeted.
[01:47.560 --> 01:52.360]  I said, I am driving 125 miles to see Steve Simone
[01:52.360 --> 01:53.560]  talk about Chinese food,
[01:53.560 --> 01:55.320]  because Steve Simone does a bit about Chinese food.
[01:55.320 --> 01:56.720]  We'll get to that in a second.
[01:56.720 --> 01:58.800]  But Steve Simone retweeted it and liked it
[01:58.800 --> 02:01.120]  and replied with, I can't wait to see you.
[02:01.120 --> 02:02.920]  Which had me excited because I met Steve Simone
[02:02.920 --> 02:03.960]  a couple of times and we've hung out,
[02:03.960 --> 02:06.480]  but we've never really interacted a lot.
[02:06.480 --> 02:08.440]  He did, however, send me a letter and some stickers
[02:08.440 --> 02:09.500]  in the mail a little while back.
[02:09.880 --> 02:11.860]  So he knows I exist and we have interacted.
[02:11.860 --> 02:13.260]  I sent the tweet, he liked it.
[02:13.260 --> 02:15.000]  He replied, when I got there,
[02:16.080 --> 02:18.120]  they walked me in the always lovely, always beautiful,
[02:18.120 --> 02:19.440]  Miss Jenny Beth, right up to the front.
[02:19.440 --> 02:21.200]  Cause I get these amazing front row seats
[02:21.200 --> 02:23.080]  because my friends at Comedy Works take great care of me
[02:23.080 --> 02:25.780]  because I have taken great care of them.
[02:25.780 --> 02:28.060]  We go up front and Steve Simone is in front of the stage,
[02:28.060 --> 02:29.140]  like setting up his microphone
[02:29.140 --> 02:30.180]  and making sure everything's cool.
[02:30.180 --> 02:31.900]  And he sees me and he goes, hey buddy.
[02:31.900 --> 02:33.540]  And he gave me a hug and told me that he loved me.
[02:33.540 --> 02:34.380]  He's like, I love you, man.
[02:34.380 --> 02:35.580]  How was the drive?
[02:35.580 --> 02:36.460]  And I told him it was cool.
[02:36.460 --> 02:38.660]  And he's like, all right, man, I'll be right back.
[02:38.660 --> 02:39.500]  And he had to disappear.
[02:39.500 --> 02:40.660]  He went backstage.
[02:40.660 --> 02:43.540]  The show started and there was another opener
[02:43.540 --> 02:45.220]  whose name I cannot recall right now.
[02:45.220 --> 02:46.660]  The opener was funny.
[02:46.660 --> 02:49.260]  The main opener, kind of the host of the show, he was funny,
[02:49.260 --> 02:52.780]  but he told a joke that was a ripoff from Joey Diaz.
[02:52.780 --> 02:54.540]  If anybody listens to the podcast frequently,
[02:54.540 --> 02:55.700]  you know I'm a comedy nerd.
[02:55.700 --> 02:56.900]  You know I listen to a lot of comedy
[02:56.900 --> 02:59.140]  and you were never going to tell a Joey fucking Diaz joke
[02:59.140 --> 03:00.820]  and it's going to slide by me.
[03:00.820 --> 03:03.060]  This guy made a joke about being allergic to peanuts.
[03:03.060 --> 03:04.620]  And he said, how are we going to beat ISIS
[03:04.620 --> 03:05.780]  if we can't beat a peanut?
[03:05.780 --> 03:07.460]  And that's a fucking Joey Diaz ripoff.
[03:07.460 --> 03:08.500]  He said it on the podcast.
[03:09.340 --> 03:11.580]  I also heard him say it in a live comedy show.
[03:11.580 --> 03:13.400]  My advice to you is if you're an up and coming comedian,
[03:13.400 --> 03:14.380]  don't ruin your fucking career
[03:14.380 --> 03:16.340]  by stealing somebody else's joke.
[03:16.340 --> 03:17.740]  This dude had me, I was laughing.
[03:17.740 --> 03:19.580]  And then he said a Joey Diaz joke and lost me.
[03:19.580 --> 03:21.460]  Anyway, after that guy was a comedian
[03:21.460 --> 03:22.940]  by the name of Brant Tobler.
[03:22.940 --> 03:24.660]  Brant Tobler did not steal any material.
[03:24.660 --> 03:27.700]  Brant Tobler was fucking hilarious the whole show.
[03:27.700 --> 03:29.160]  That dude had me laughing my ass off.
[03:29.160 --> 03:30.060]  Being down there in the front row,
[03:30.060 --> 03:30.980]  you get a lot of interaction.
[03:30.980 --> 03:32.120]  So they look you straight in the face.
[03:32.120 --> 03:33.260]  They make sure that you're laughing
[03:33.260 --> 03:34.660]  because that's the only way they know
[03:34.660 --> 03:35.580]  if the jokes are going well.
[03:35.580 --> 03:37.300]  So they pay a lot of attention to my laughter.
[03:37.300 --> 03:38.260]  I try to laugh and let them know,
[03:38.900 --> 03:39.740]  hey bro, you're doing a good job.
[03:39.740 --> 03:41.340]  Brant Tobler was hilarious.
[03:41.340 --> 03:42.500]  He told a couple of really good,
[03:42.500 --> 03:43.860]  he tells long stories.
[03:43.860 --> 03:45.900]  His jokes are long, his bits are long.
[03:45.900 --> 03:46.740]  And I enjoy that.
[03:46.740 --> 03:48.300]  It gets you sucked in, you feel involved.
[03:48.300 --> 03:50.120]  And then all of a sudden there's just this funny,
[03:50.120 --> 03:50.960]  this wave of funny.
[03:50.960 --> 03:52.500]  And once you're so invested in a story,
[03:52.500 --> 03:54.820]  these guys can tell you seven or eight punchlines
[03:54.820 --> 03:56.360]  just after telling you a story.
[03:56.360 --> 03:57.740]  And I was laughing so hard,
[03:57.740 --> 04:00.400]  my face hurt a little bit from Brant Tobler's jokes.
[04:00.400 --> 04:01.660]  But anyway, Brant Tobler finished up.
[04:01.660 --> 04:02.700]  He probably did a good 25.
[04:02.700 --> 04:04.060]  The first guy did 15.
[04:04.060 --> 04:06.060]  Brant Tobler probably did 25.
[04:06.060 --> 04:08.580]  And then my buddy, Mr. Steve Simone,
[04:08.580 --> 04:11.060]  the host of the Good Times with Steve Simone podcast
[04:11.060 --> 04:14.020]  came out and did, it was a long show.
[04:14.020 --> 04:15.000]  I don't know how long he did,
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.700]  but he just sits on this little,
[04:16.700 --> 04:17.540]  there's a bar stool.
[04:17.540 --> 04:19.500]  He sits on the bar stool and he just got comfortable.
[04:19.500 --> 04:21.540]  It felt like I was just hanging out with Steve Simone.
[04:21.540 --> 04:22.780]  He was right in my face.
[04:22.780 --> 04:23.820]  He was right in front of me,
[04:23.820 --> 04:26.300]  just telling jokes to me in the front row right there.
[04:26.300 --> 04:28.100]  It was pretty hilarious.
[04:28.100 --> 04:32.820]  So I mentioned earlier that I tweeted about Chinese food.
[04:32.820 --> 04:34.740]  So if you know Steve Simone,
[04:34.740 --> 04:38.060]  Steve Simone can do a lot of material on Chinese food.
[04:38.060 --> 04:40.820]  He can make you laugh for three hours about Chinese food.
[04:40.820 --> 04:42.180]  And I've heard a lot of it.
[04:43.020 --> 04:45.160]  The material I've heard about Chinese food
[04:45.160 --> 04:47.140]  was always about him being an adult
[04:47.140 --> 04:48.540]  and getting Chinese food.
[04:48.540 --> 04:49.900]  The most popular bit is,
[04:49.900 --> 04:50.940]  and I'm not gonna ruin his bit,
[04:50.940 --> 04:52.140]  but I'll give you the premise,
[04:52.140 --> 04:53.020]  that when Chinese food,
[04:53.020 --> 04:54.800]  you order Chinese food and it's mysterious
[04:54.800 --> 04:56.740]  because you don't know what the shit on the menu is.
[04:56.740 --> 04:58.500]  You're like, what does this mean?
[04:58.500 --> 04:59.340]  What are these words?
[04:59.340 --> 05:01.220]  And it's all like mystical and you order it.
[05:01.220 --> 05:02.500]  And I'm not doing his jokes justice.
[05:02.500 --> 05:03.340]  I'm not trying.
[05:03.340 --> 05:04.160]  I don't want it to be dumb
[05:04.160 --> 05:05.680]  but I do hear his.
[05:05.680 --> 05:07.160]  You can still laugh at his jokes.
[05:07.160 --> 05:08.980]  And then he talks about when the food arrives,
[05:08.980 --> 05:10.160]  all these containers show up
[05:10.160 --> 05:12.240]  and all these adults are arguing over whose is what
[05:12.240 --> 05:13.840]  because nobody even knows what they ordered.
[05:13.840 --> 05:14.720]  And then you look at your friends
[05:14.720 --> 05:16.160]  and you're like, damn, that looks good.
[05:16.160 --> 05:17.840]  So everyone ends up trading a scoop.
[05:17.840 --> 05:19.400]  And it's all about being an adult
[05:19.400 --> 05:21.040]  and how amazing Chinese food is.
[05:21.040 --> 05:21.920]  And I know it sounds crazy
[05:21.920 --> 05:23.980]  that the guy can tell three hours of jokes.
[05:23.980 --> 05:25.880]  I saw him do 45 minutes on Chinese food
[05:25.880 --> 05:27.680]  the last time I saw him.
[05:27.680 --> 05:30.280]  So he talks about Chinese food for a long time, right?
[05:30.280 --> 05:33.400]  Steve Simone did his act this time at Comedy Works.
[05:33.400 --> 05:35.520]  He probably went for 30, 45 minutes.
[05:35.520 --> 05:36.840]  And then he sat on a stool
[05:36.840 --> 05:38.420]  and he pushed his sleeves on his sweater up
[05:38.420 --> 05:40.040]  and he looked me in the face and he goes,
[05:40.040 --> 05:41.280]  you guys want to hear about the first time
[05:41.280 --> 05:42.600]  I ate Chinese food?
[05:42.600 --> 05:43.800]  And that's not exactly what he said
[05:43.800 --> 05:45.640]  but that's basically how he did it.
[05:45.640 --> 05:47.240]  And he looked me straight in the face and he was like,
[05:47.240 --> 05:49.360]  well, here's the first time I had Chinese food.
[05:49.360 --> 05:51.560]  And he proceeded to tell the story
[05:51.560 --> 05:53.760]  of how he discovered Chinese food
[05:53.760 --> 05:56.580]  and going to the restaurant to get Chinese food.
[05:56.580 --> 05:57.740]  And one of the parts that caught me
[05:57.740 --> 05:59.200]  was he walked in the restaurant and he goes,
[05:59.200 --> 06:01.640]  I walked in and there's a giant mother effing dragon.
[06:01.640 --> 06:03.000]  And I'm like, I'm home.
[06:03.600 --> 06:05.040]  It's not exactly how he tells the bit
[06:05.040 --> 06:08.080]  because I'm not Steve Simone, but it's fucking hilarious.
[06:08.080 --> 06:10.640]  So I got to, he did, I feel like he kind of did that for me.
[06:10.640 --> 06:12.880]  He looked me directly in the face and was like,
[06:12.880 --> 06:15.720]  you want to hear about my first time eating Chinese food?
[06:15.720 --> 06:17.520]  Because I tweeted him that and he totally knew
[06:17.520 --> 06:19.320]  that I was coming to see the Chinese food joke.
[06:19.320 --> 06:21.920]  And the always lovely, always beautiful Miss Jenny Beth
[06:21.920 --> 06:23.500]  grabbed my leg and gave me a little squeeze like,
[06:23.500 --> 06:24.960]  hey baby, this part's for you.
[06:24.960 --> 06:27.080]  It was so cool that we had that little connection with Steve.
[06:27.080 --> 06:28.920]  So Steve did the show and it was hilarious.
[06:28.920 --> 06:30.680]  The show ended and everybody applauded
[06:30.680 --> 06:31.760]  and I'm up in the front row.
[06:31.760 --> 06:34.920]  So honestly, that's the last seat to get out of the venue.
[06:34.920 --> 06:36.280]  Like when the show ends, you're stuck
[06:36.280 --> 06:38.040]  because there's all these people that were behind you.
[06:38.040 --> 06:39.360]  Now they're actually the front of the line.
[06:39.360 --> 06:41.200]  So they're escaping the show first.
[06:41.200 --> 06:42.980]  But I was in no hurry because I knew,
[06:42.980 --> 06:45.340]  I know Steve Simone, I know him very well.
[06:45.340 --> 06:47.560]  He went to the backstage to go like catch his breath
[06:47.560 --> 06:48.920]  probably went and got a bottle of water,
[06:48.920 --> 06:50.640]  took a break, calmed down for just a couple of minutes.
[06:50.640 --> 06:53.200]  And then he walked right out from backstage up to me
[06:53.200 --> 06:54.600]  and he had a tray of food in his hand.
[06:54.600 --> 06:56.320]  He goes, hey buddy, I've got a bunch of food
[06:56.320 --> 06:57.560]  if you guys are hungry.
[06:57.560 --> 06:59.120]  And I was like, holy shit.
[06:59.120 --> 07:00.080]  And I go, I'm a vegetarian.
[07:00.120 --> 07:01.840]  And he said, there's cheese pizza.
[07:01.840 --> 07:02.800]  Like he already knew.
[07:02.800 --> 07:04.080]  He's like, there's cheese pizza, buddy.
[07:04.080 --> 07:04.920]  Don't worry.
[07:04.920 --> 07:06.440]  He'd solved all the problems.
[07:06.440 --> 07:08.360]  He's like pizza, pizza is a backup plan.
[07:08.360 --> 07:09.840]  I've got pizza for you.
[07:09.840 --> 07:11.200]  And so I was like, well shit, yeah.
[07:11.200 --> 07:12.580]  And he goes, stay right here.
[07:12.580 --> 07:14.480]  And Steve Simone went and wandered around comedy works.
[07:14.480 --> 07:15.520]  He had to go talk to a few people.
[07:15.520 --> 07:17.200]  You know, he was schmoozing it up.
[07:17.200 --> 07:19.480]  And then I didn't see him for a few minutes.
[07:19.480 --> 07:21.560]  And so I walked down this one little corridor.
[07:21.560 --> 07:23.000]  Jenny and I walked down the corridor
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.360]  and he goes, hey, come on.
[07:24.360 --> 07:26.520]  And he was just in this little back area by himself
[07:26.520 --> 07:27.840]  setting up plates of food.
[07:27.840 --> 07:29.080]  And he's like, come on, buddy.
[07:29.080 --> 07:30.240]  And I went back there and he's like, man,
[07:30.240 --> 07:31.120]  all this food's available.
[07:31.120 --> 07:32.360]  Whatever you want to eat, dig in.
[07:32.360 --> 07:34.780]  And people had brought Steve.
[07:34.780 --> 07:38.040]  There was pasta, there was mole, there was tortillas,
[07:38.040 --> 07:40.440]  there were burrito fixings, there was pizza.
[07:40.440 --> 07:42.200]  There were little Tupperware dishes full of stuff
[07:42.200 --> 07:43.320]  that I didn't even bother to open
[07:43.320 --> 07:44.660]  because there was so much stuff there.
[07:44.660 --> 07:46.880]  I didn't need to find more food.
[07:46.880 --> 07:49.200]  Steve was just grubbing and munching down.
[07:49.200 --> 07:51.080]  And Brant Tobler came back and Brant Tobler,
[07:51.080 --> 07:53.180]  Steve Simone, Jenny Beth and myself
[07:53.180 --> 07:55.080]  basically ate dinner together.
[07:55.080 --> 07:57.040]  I know it sounds like I might be telling a story,
[07:57.040 --> 07:58.840]  but we all sat around and we ate dinner
[07:59.600 --> 08:00.520]  and we just kind of bullshitted about life.
[08:00.520 --> 08:01.340]  And it's really funny,
[08:01.340 --> 08:03.800]  Steve Simone does not use any profanity on stage.
[08:03.800 --> 08:05.080]  Steve doesn't cuss at all.
[08:05.080 --> 08:05.920]  He's a pretty good dude.
[08:05.920 --> 08:08.020]  He wants to be able to have, he says grownups.
[08:08.020 --> 08:10.320]  He's 40 years old and he still calls adults grownups
[08:10.320 --> 08:11.360]  because he's a little kid at heart,
[08:11.360 --> 08:12.900]  which is what I love about him.
[08:12.900 --> 08:14.920]  And he's so honest and so genuine
[08:14.920 --> 08:16.160]  and just so grateful for life.
[08:16.160 --> 08:19.160]  But I kind of forgot what the fuck I was going to say now.
[08:19.160 --> 08:20.080]  Grownups, he doesn't cuss.
[08:20.080 --> 08:21.440]  He wants to have a show for grownups
[08:21.440 --> 08:23.160]  and that you could bring little kids to.
[08:23.160 --> 08:25.360]  He says he wants your grandma to bring your grandson
[08:25.360 --> 08:27.040]  to the show and have a good time.
[08:27.040 --> 08:28.360]  It's kind of his theory.
[08:28.880 --> 08:30.240]  And he was doing something and he said,
[08:30.240 --> 08:31.680]  fuck in normal conversation.
[08:31.680 --> 08:33.460]  He got food on his shirt and he said, fuck.
[08:33.460 --> 08:36.200]  And Jenny and I looked at each other and we got quiet.
[08:36.200 --> 08:37.040]  And Steve goes, what?
[08:37.040 --> 08:39.160]  And I go, we just heard the principal say, fuck.
[08:39.160 --> 08:40.000]  And it was really funny.
[08:40.000 --> 08:41.920]  He's like, no man, I curse off stage.
[08:41.920 --> 08:42.760]  It was just really funny
[08:42.760 --> 08:44.880]  because one time he did say mother fudging
[08:44.880 --> 08:45.760]  like he was on stage.
[08:45.760 --> 08:47.280]  And I thought that was pretty funny too.
[08:47.280 --> 08:50.760]  But anyway, I owe a huge shout out to my friend Baker.
[08:50.760 --> 08:53.440]  Baker, if you're listening to this podcast, thank you.
[08:53.440 --> 08:54.280]  Huge thank you.
[08:54.280 --> 08:55.280]  You know why?
[08:55.280 --> 08:56.120]  Thank you.
[08:56.120 --> 08:56.940]  Much love.
[08:57.460 --> 08:58.460]  I love you every day, Baker.
[08:58.460 --> 08:59.900]  Even though I don't see you frequently,
[08:59.900 --> 09:00.740]  dude, Jenny and I talk about you.
[09:00.740 --> 09:03.020]  We're like that Baker kid is a good boy.
[09:03.020 --> 09:04.300]  So much love, Baker.
[09:04.300 --> 09:05.140]  You know who you are, brother.
[09:05.140 --> 09:06.060]  I hope you're hearing this.
[09:06.060 --> 09:09.120]  Also huge, huge shout out to the best comedy club
[09:09.120 --> 09:12.420]  on the planet, or at least the best comedy club in Colorado
[09:12.420 --> 09:13.300]  in this part of the country.
[09:13.300 --> 09:14.940]  The only place that could even rival the place
[09:14.940 --> 09:16.660]  is the comedy store in California.
[09:16.660 --> 09:18.420]  But huge shout out to my friends at Comedy Works
[09:18.420 --> 09:19.840]  in downtown Denver.
[09:19.840 --> 09:20.740]  Big shout out to Wendy.
[09:20.740 --> 09:22.700]  Big shout out to all of the hosts and hostesses
[09:22.700 --> 09:23.860]  and managers.
[09:23.860 --> 09:25.100]  Big shout out to the ticket people.
[09:25.100 --> 09:26.980]  Big shout out to everybody at Comedy Works.
[09:26.980 --> 09:28.760]  I got mad love for everybody there.
[09:28.760 --> 09:31.160]  They show me mad love every time I go there.
[09:31.160 --> 09:32.260]  I'm not a comedian.
[09:32.260 --> 09:34.060]  I'm not a rock star, but for some reason,
[09:34.060 --> 09:35.980]  everybody at Comedy Works treats me
[09:35.980 --> 09:37.260]  like I am a fucking rock star.
[09:37.260 --> 09:38.660]  They roll out the red carpet.
[09:38.660 --> 09:41.100]  They take really good care of me, and I appreciate it.
[09:41.100 --> 09:42.980]  Huge, I might have left out the wait staff.
[09:42.980 --> 09:44.700]  Huge big ups to the wait staff,
[09:44.700 --> 09:46.060]  because they always keep my drinks coming.
[09:46.060 --> 09:47.900]  They know what I want to drink already.
[09:47.900 --> 09:48.740]  Much love.
[09:48.740 --> 09:49.560]  I appreciate it.
[09:49.560 --> 09:50.980]  And then I can't give a big enough shout out
[09:50.980 --> 09:53.300]  and a big enough thank you to Brant Tobler
[09:53.300 --> 09:55.740]  and of course, Mr. Steve Simone.
[09:55.740 --> 09:57.460]  Dude, I'm grateful for you.
[09:57.460 --> 09:59.940]  On Steve's podcast, he does a gratitude list.
[09:59.940 --> 10:01.880]  I'm grateful to have spent a few moments
[10:01.880 --> 10:05.160]  with one of my favorite comedians who changed my attitude,
[10:05.160 --> 10:06.860]  who gave me a little different outlook on life,
[10:06.860 --> 10:08.200]  at least maybe for a few days,
[10:08.200 --> 10:10.100]  but it did stick in the back of my head.
[10:10.100 --> 10:11.220]  So much love, much respect.
[10:11.220 --> 10:12.140]  Thank you.
[10:12.140 --> 10:13.240]  And of course to Jenny Beth
[10:13.240 --> 10:15.180]  for being a beautiful, amazing, great date.
[10:15.180 --> 10:16.220]  I had a fun time with you.
[10:16.220 --> 10:18.300]  Thanks for making everything perfect that night.
[10:18.300 --> 10:19.620]  Super great dab session in the car
[10:19.620 --> 10:21.080]  before and after the show.
[10:21.080 --> 10:21.920]  Excellent.
[10:21.920 --> 10:22.740]  All right, you guys, I'm sure you don't want to hear
[10:23.180 --> 10:24.020]  too much about the dab session
[10:24.020 --> 10:24.840]  with my girlfriend in the car.
[10:24.840 --> 10:26.360]  Let's talk more about cannabis.
[10:27.540 --> 10:29.780]  I want to do something that may make me sound
[10:29.780 --> 10:30.980]  like a little bit of an asshole,
[10:30.980 --> 10:34.500]  but it will make you a better cannabis advocate
[10:34.500 --> 10:37.400]  or a cannabis spokesperson in the future.
[10:37.400 --> 10:40.180]  I hear a lot of people say the wrong terminology
[10:40.180 --> 10:41.220]  when it comes to cannabis.
[10:41.220 --> 10:43.760]  And I feel like I'm responsible
[10:43.760 --> 10:45.740]  for teaching you the correct terms.
[10:45.740 --> 10:48.020]  I'm sort of a historian of sorts, I guess,
[10:48.020 --> 10:49.540]  when I'm podcasting.
[10:49.540 --> 10:50.980]  I'm an archivist, you know what I mean?
[10:50.980 --> 10:52.140]  We're marking history.
[10:52.580 --> 10:54.020]  And the people that are involved in cannabis right now
[10:54.020 --> 10:54.860]  are pioneers.
[10:54.860 --> 10:57.460]  We are starting an industry that is very new.
[10:57.460 --> 10:58.860]  And there are a lot of people that are coming in
[10:58.860 --> 11:00.180]  that are new, that are saying,
[11:00.180 --> 11:02.260]  that are just simply making word mistakes,
[11:02.260 --> 11:03.140]  one-letter mistakes.
[11:03.140 --> 11:04.300]  And I want to correct you.
[11:04.300 --> 11:05.380]  I'm not coming to be an asshole.
[11:05.380 --> 11:08.140]  I want you to sound like a better, smarter grower,
[11:08.140 --> 11:09.300]  smarter advocate,
[11:09.300 --> 11:11.780]  because people already think we're lazy potheads.
[11:11.780 --> 11:12.840]  People think we're stoners.
[11:12.840 --> 11:14.540]  People think we're not paying attention.
[11:14.540 --> 11:15.820]  So I think it's a little important
[11:15.820 --> 11:18.620]  that we take the extra effort to speak correctly,
[11:18.620 --> 11:20.980]  to spell correctly, to have good grammar.
[11:20.980 --> 11:22.840]  If you're gonna put your shit out there in public,
[11:22.840 --> 11:24.780]  make it presentable so that people don't think
[11:24.780 --> 11:26.100]  you're a lazy stoner.
[11:26.100 --> 11:28.340]  So with all of that being said,
[11:28.340 --> 11:29.980]  I've kind of created a glossary
[11:29.980 --> 11:31.180]  and some things that I want to go over.
[11:31.180 --> 11:32.540]  It's just a short list.
[11:32.540 --> 11:34.540]  And I'm not trying to be an asshole about it.
[11:34.540 --> 11:35.900]  It sounds like I'm being a stuck-up jerk,
[11:35.900 --> 11:37.980]  but I really want you to sound smarter.
[11:37.980 --> 11:39.700]  And I feel embarrassed for good growers
[11:39.700 --> 11:40.620]  when they say the wrong shit.
[11:40.620 --> 11:44.940]  I'm like, ah, because one thing
[11:44.940 --> 11:46.660]  can ruin all of your credibility,
[11:46.660 --> 11:47.860]  especially being a pothead.
[11:47.860 --> 11:49.340]  People already don't take you seriously.
[11:49.340 --> 11:51.300]  So if you go, bro, too many times,
[11:51.300 --> 11:52.900]  they've already, they don't respect you,
[11:52.900 --> 11:53.860]  you've lost credibility.
[11:53.860 --> 11:56.820]  So if you say trichromes instead of trichomes,
[11:56.820 --> 11:58.020]  you're gonna fuck up your credibility.
[11:58.020 --> 12:00.260]  So that's the first thing we're gonna start with.
[12:00.260 --> 12:01.460]  The word is trichomes.
[12:01.460 --> 12:03.340]  Those crystals that grow on your plants,
[12:03.340 --> 12:04.860]  those little mushroom-looking things,
[12:04.860 --> 12:06.420]  they are trichomes.
[12:06.420 --> 12:09.060]  Don't call them crystals, they're resin glands.
[12:09.060 --> 12:11.540]  You can say resin glands, but they are trichome.
[12:11.540 --> 12:16.500]  T-R-I-C-H-O-M-E, trichome, not trichrome,
[12:16.500 --> 12:19.140]  not trichome, not trichromes,
[12:19.140 --> 12:21.260]  but just a trichome, okay?
[12:21.260 --> 12:23.140]  All right, that's our first glossary word of the day.
[12:23.140 --> 12:24.540]  You see how easy it's gonna be?
[12:24.540 --> 12:25.940]  There are a few people right now that just went,
[12:25.940 --> 12:28.140]  ah, shit, I've been saying that wrong for so long.
[12:28.140 --> 12:29.380]  Thank you, Rasta Jeff.
[12:29.380 --> 12:31.660]  So the word is trichome.
[12:31.660 --> 12:33.740]  Try to comb your hair, trichome.
[12:33.740 --> 12:35.140]  But don't put the B in there, there's no B.
[12:35.140 --> 12:37.740]  It's not a trichome, but it's a trichome.
[12:37.740 --> 12:40.140]  All right, trichome, all right.
[12:40.140 --> 12:41.060]  That was easy enough.
[12:41.060 --> 12:41.980]  I don't feel so bad now.
[12:41.980 --> 12:42.900]  The next one, you guys,
[12:42.900 --> 12:45.580]  this bugs the shit out of me for some reason.
[12:45.580 --> 12:47.540]  Quit saying CBDs.
[12:47.540 --> 12:48.380]  It's not plural.
[12:48.380 --> 12:50.180]  CBD is not pluralized.
[12:50.180 --> 12:52.620]  They say, I want a weed with a lot of CBDs.
[12:52.620 --> 12:53.460]  Bro, come on.
[12:53.460 --> 12:56.700]  You want cannabis with CBD, high-end CBD.
[12:57.780 --> 12:58.860]  And this is my comparison.
[12:58.860 --> 13:00.780]  Do you ever ask for a glass of waters?
[13:00.780 --> 13:02.420]  No matter how much water is in your glass,
[13:02.420 --> 13:03.540]  it's still just water.
[13:03.540 --> 13:04.940]  It's not plural waters.
[13:04.940 --> 13:07.340]  Maybe if you gathered water from two sources and mixed them,
[13:07.340 --> 13:08.500]  you might have waters.
[13:08.500 --> 13:09.500]  But as far as I'm concerned,
[13:09.500 --> 13:12.580]  this bottle of water right here is water, not waters.
[13:12.580 --> 13:13.780]  I don't want waters.
[13:13.780 --> 13:16.220]  I would like a water or some water.
[13:16.220 --> 13:18.220]  So let's stop pluralizing CBD.
[13:18.220 --> 13:19.740]  It just sounds wonky to me.
[13:19.740 --> 13:21.100]  I don't think it's correct.
[13:21.100 --> 13:22.260]  It's CBD.
[13:22.260 --> 13:23.540]  There's only one CBD.
[13:23.540 --> 13:25.180]  There are different cannabinoids.
[13:25.180 --> 13:26.420]  There are different terpenoids,
[13:26.420 --> 13:28.820]  but there is only one CBD.
[13:28.820 --> 13:29.780]  All right, that's my story.
[13:29.780 --> 13:30.900]  I'm sticking with it.
[13:30.900 --> 13:34.060]  Next, this one's directed at somebody specifically,
[13:34.060 --> 13:35.500]  and I'm sorry.
[13:35.500 --> 13:37.660]  I must correct you because every time I hear you say it,
[13:37.660 --> 13:38.900]  I go, God damn it.
[13:38.900 --> 13:40.100]  I love you every day.
[13:40.100 --> 13:41.340]  Every time I hear your voice,
[13:41.340 --> 13:42.540]  I'm proud that you're doing what you do.
[13:42.540 --> 13:45.140]  But, but it bugs the shit out of me
[13:45.180 --> 13:48.980]  when people call a slab of shatter or some hash,
[13:48.980 --> 13:50.060]  they call it dab.
[13:50.060 --> 13:51.620]  I wanna buy some dab.
[13:51.620 --> 13:53.060]  No, please don't say that.
[13:53.060 --> 13:56.020]  A dab is the thing that is on the tip of your dabber.
[13:56.020 --> 13:57.940]  The dab is the part you're consuming.
[13:57.940 --> 13:59.100]  You don't buy dab.
[13:59.100 --> 14:00.900]  You may buy a dab if somebody's got a dabber
[14:00.900 --> 14:01.740]  and they're gonna put a dab on it.
[14:01.740 --> 14:03.820]  You may buy a dab, but you don't buy dab.
[14:03.820 --> 14:05.580]  You don't, you don't, I'm sorry.
[14:05.580 --> 14:06.860]  You know who I'm talking to and you're going,
[14:06.860 --> 14:08.420]  fuck you Rasta Jeff, I already know you are,
[14:08.420 --> 14:09.380]  but I still love you.
[14:09.380 --> 14:10.500]  I still love your podcast.
[14:10.500 --> 14:12.620]  I just, I just, I'm not gonna call you out.
[14:12.620 --> 14:14.580]  I just, quit, quit saying dab.
[14:15.020 --> 14:16.940]  It's dabs, you've got some concentrate.
[14:17.780 --> 14:18.980]  You are taking a dab.
[14:18.980 --> 14:21.240]  You're going to buy some dabs maybe,
[14:21.240 --> 14:23.820]  but it just bugs me when you say I'm going to buy dab.
[14:23.820 --> 14:26.060]  All right, I kind of feel like an asshole for my corrections,
[14:26.060 --> 14:28.420]  but some people are gonna sound like better people.
[14:28.420 --> 14:29.700]  Just for me helping you out a little bit.
[14:29.700 --> 14:31.660]  I kind of feel like it's my duty.
[14:31.660 --> 14:35.100]  So to recap that without feeling like a jerk,
[14:35.100 --> 14:37.040]  I am going to buy some concentrate
[14:37.040 --> 14:38.980]  or I am going to buy some hash.
[14:38.980 --> 14:41.100]  I'm going to buy a slab
[14:41.100 --> 14:44.300]  and then I will take a dab of my shatter.
[14:45.020 --> 14:47.500]  I have got some dabs on my shirt because I dropped some.
[14:47.500 --> 14:50.540]  I've got a dab stuck to the table.
[14:50.540 --> 14:54.020]  That stuff works, but I don't have dabs stuck to my shirt.
[14:54.020 --> 14:55.260]  That just sounds weird.
[14:55.260 --> 14:56.300]  I'm not mad at you.
[14:56.300 --> 14:57.860]  I just want you to sound better.
[14:57.860 --> 14:58.940]  Trying to help you out.
[14:58.940 --> 15:01.020]  All right, let's move forward.
[15:01.020 --> 15:03.220]  And if I offended you, I'm sorry.
[15:03.220 --> 15:04.060]  Send me hate mail.
[15:04.060 --> 15:05.820]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[15:05.820 --> 15:06.980]  I'll read it and I'll reply,
[15:06.980 --> 15:09.180]  but I apologize in advance if that sounded rude.
[15:09.180 --> 15:10.020]  I felt kind of rude doing it,
[15:10.020 --> 15:12.020]  but honestly, I just want you to sound better.
[15:12.020 --> 15:14.060]  I want everybody to be better.
[15:14.820 --> 15:15.660]  I'm trying to lift you up.
[15:15.660 --> 15:18.100]  All right, I just looked up at the clock and it is 709.
[15:18.100 --> 15:19.740]  So that means we got to start heating the nail
[15:19.740 --> 15:23.220]  because at 710, we're going to take us a big old fat dab.
[15:23.220 --> 15:24.060]  That's right.
[15:25.500 --> 15:27.420]  Slowly heat the nail.
[15:28.900 --> 15:30.100]  Got to put some taint in the torch.
[15:30.100 --> 15:32.220]  There's not enough butane in the torch to make a fire
[15:32.220 --> 15:34.720]  because this is not professional podcasting right here.
[15:34.720 --> 15:36.380]  We're filling a torch with butane.
[15:36.380 --> 15:39.300]  I'm just using cheap butane on my elevate torch.
[15:39.300 --> 15:40.860]  Now we're still going to make it.
[15:40.860 --> 15:42.180]  We're going to be on time for 710.
[15:42.180 --> 15:43.020]  Don't worry.
[15:44.980 --> 15:46.380]  Heating it up.
[15:46.380 --> 15:47.440]  It's getting hot.
[15:47.440 --> 15:49.780]  I'm still using the thermal banger
[15:49.780 --> 15:52.500]  on the Hitman Hammerhead rig.
[15:52.500 --> 15:53.740]  And I've got the bubble cap right here.
[15:53.740 --> 15:56.540]  I'm actually using a custom red, yellow,
[15:56.540 --> 15:58.980]  and green pencil from Tater Glass.
[15:58.980 --> 16:00.860]  It was a gift from the always lovely,
[16:00.860 --> 16:02.020]  always beautiful Jenny Beth.
[16:02.020 --> 16:03.180]  Thank you for the gift.
[16:04.100 --> 16:06.420]  This nail is just about hot enough
[16:06.420 --> 16:09.580]  and it's got to cool down for just a couple of seconds.
[16:09.580 --> 16:11.420]  It is now 710.
[16:11.420 --> 16:12.560]  I'm going to take a 710 dab.
[16:12.560 --> 16:13.620]  I hope you guys are dabbing with me.
[16:14.180 --> 16:15.020]  Send me an email or a tweet.
[16:15.020 --> 16:16.340]  Let me know what you're smoking.
[16:16.340 --> 16:17.180]  Here we go.
[16:17.180 --> 16:18.020]  Cheers.
[16:18.020 --> 16:18.840]  Happy 710 everybody.
[16:24.210 --> 16:25.250]  That's a big dab.
[16:25.250 --> 16:26.450]  I'm going to cap it now.
[16:37.300 --> 16:38.220]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[16:38.220 --> 16:39.860]  I have got a nice fat dab in me.
[16:41.340 --> 16:43.980]  Let's work our way into some emails now.
[16:43.980 --> 16:45.740]  I've got a big stack of emails right here.
[16:45.740 --> 16:46.980]  I'm just going to go through and randomly
[16:46.980 --> 16:49.060]  pull out an email out of this stack.
[16:49.060 --> 16:51.020]  And I'm not even doing any sort of selection.
[16:51.020 --> 16:54.700]  I just want to pull out this one right here.
[16:54.700 --> 16:58.140]  And it says, let me get it right in front of my face.
[16:58.140 --> 16:59.740]  I'm making sure they want me to
[16:59.740 --> 17:01.100]  or not want me to say their name.
[17:01.100 --> 17:02.140]  It doesn't give me indication.
[17:02.140 --> 17:03.780]  So I'm not going to say your name.
[17:03.780 --> 17:04.620]  You know who you are.
[17:04.620 --> 17:05.440]  Thanks for the email.
[17:05.440 --> 17:06.340]  If you'd like to send me an email,
[17:06.340 --> 17:08.060]  it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[17:08.060 --> 17:10.820]  I would love to answer your questions on the podcast.
[17:10.820 --> 17:11.820]  This email goes like this.
[17:11.820 --> 17:12.980]  Hi Ross to Jeff.
[17:12.980 --> 17:14.780]  Hey, you have talked about breeding on the podcast,
[17:14.780 --> 17:17.860]  but what about just making seeds of your favorite strain?
[17:17.860 --> 17:19.940]  I have slowly collected a lot of genetics
[17:19.940 --> 17:21.320]  and I'm having to keep cutting clones
[17:21.320 --> 17:22.780]  just to keep them around.
[17:22.780 --> 17:24.240]  I'd love to be able to make seeds
[17:24.760 --> 17:26.960]  and then put them away while I experiment
[17:26.960 --> 17:28.400]  with new strains.
[17:28.400 --> 17:31.120]  For example, I just bought a five pack of jelly bean
[17:31.120 --> 17:33.800]  and have two females and one male right now.
[17:33.800 --> 17:36.520]  Could I pollinate just one section of one of the females
[17:36.520 --> 17:39.640]  to make some seeds for later?
[17:39.640 --> 17:42.220]  Thanks for the best cannabis podcast out there.
[17:42.220 --> 17:43.420]  And then he signs his name.
[17:43.420 --> 17:46.340]  Dude, you are welcome for the best cannabis podcast
[17:46.340 --> 17:47.180]  out there.
[17:47.180 --> 17:48.220]  Thanks for the huge compliment.
[17:48.220 --> 17:49.600]  I don't know that I'm the best,
[17:49.600 --> 17:51.920]  but since you say so that means it's real, man.
[17:51.920 --> 17:52.900]  Thank you.
[17:52.940 --> 17:55.020]  Also huge shout out to all the other cannabis podcasts
[17:55.020 --> 17:55.860]  out there.
[17:55.860 --> 17:57.700]  I listened to a lot of them and I do appreciate them.
[17:57.700 --> 17:59.940]  So to hear that you think I'm the best means a lot to me.
[17:59.940 --> 18:00.780]  That's serious.
[18:00.780 --> 18:01.600]  I'm not even joking.
[18:01.600 --> 18:02.440]  So thanks.
[18:02.440 --> 18:04.180]  Let's get to the heart of this email.
[18:04.180 --> 18:05.820]  I love that you're working with jelly bean.
[18:05.820 --> 18:08.260]  Jelly bean is so much fun to work with.
[18:08.260 --> 18:11.120]  You said you have got two females and one male.
[18:11.120 --> 18:14.460]  I hope, I hope that you have got a candy store Fino
[18:14.460 --> 18:16.180]  and an orange Fino.
[18:16.180 --> 18:17.380]  There are good chances of that.
[18:17.380 --> 18:19.540]  If you pop five seeds and you've got that many,
[18:19.540 --> 18:20.460]  if you've got three around,
[18:20.460 --> 18:21.700]  one's a boy and you've got two girls,
[18:21.700 --> 18:23.740]  oh, you'd be so lucky to have the candy store
[18:23.740 --> 18:25.060]  and the orange Fino.
[18:25.060 --> 18:26.560]  The candy store one kind of,
[18:26.560 --> 18:28.220]  it smells like the candy store in the mall
[18:28.220 --> 18:30.140]  is the best way to describe it.
[18:30.140 --> 18:31.780]  You know how some of the candy, when you bite into it,
[18:31.780 --> 18:33.480]  it's got that real sweet, but you could taste,
[18:33.480 --> 18:35.220]  it's still powdery and it's like,
[18:35.220 --> 18:37.060]  and it smells like jelly beans or jelly.
[18:37.060 --> 18:37.900]  I said, jelly beans.
[18:37.900 --> 18:38.720]  That's funny.
[18:38.720 --> 18:39.900]  It smells like jelly beans.
[18:39.900 --> 18:41.160]  That's the candy store Fino.
[18:41.160 --> 18:44.060]  The orange Fino smells like a glass of orange juice,
[18:44.060 --> 18:46.760]  just straight up orange juice with maybe like another hint
[18:46.760 --> 18:49.180]  of like lemon or pineapple or something.
[18:49.180 --> 18:51.300]  But those are the two Finos that are well-known.
[18:51.900 --> 18:53.380]  And if you've got one of those, you're a lucky dude.
[18:53.380 --> 18:55.860]  If you've got each of those, you're super lucky.
[18:55.860 --> 18:56.700]  Now you're male.
[18:57.620 --> 18:59.420]  I'm not gonna get too picky on male selection
[18:59.420 --> 19:00.660]  because you've only got one,
[19:00.660 --> 19:02.360]  but we do know that it's a jelly bean.
[19:02.360 --> 19:04.860]  So yes, there is nothing stopping you
[19:04.860 --> 19:07.780]  from putting that male plant in with those two females
[19:07.780 --> 19:09.780]  and letting him put pollen.
[19:09.780 --> 19:12.700]  So you said, you said, for example,
[19:12.700 --> 19:13.660]  I just bought a five pack.
[19:13.660 --> 19:16.240]  Can I pollinate just one section of the females?
[19:16.240 --> 19:18.120]  Yes, but that's a pain in the ass.
[19:18.120 --> 19:20.140]  Not getting pollen on the other parts of the plant
[19:20.140 --> 19:21.300]  will be a challenge.
[19:22.180 --> 19:23.740]  What I would do is just put,
[19:23.740 --> 19:26.180]  I would put the male in the room about 14 days ahead.
[19:26.180 --> 19:27.420]  And then I would put the girl in there.
[19:27.420 --> 19:28.980]  I would honestly, if you could keep them separate,
[19:28.980 --> 19:31.360]  that's best flower the male about 14 days ahead,
[19:31.360 --> 19:32.520]  put the girls in there.
[19:33.380 --> 19:35.340]  If the girl's about 21 days into flower,
[19:35.340 --> 19:38.200]  that means that the boys are gonna be about 35 days
[19:38.200 --> 19:39.540]  into flower at that point,
[19:39.540 --> 19:41.940]  carry the boy into there and shake it all over the girls.
[19:41.940 --> 19:43.840]  Now those girls are totally pollinated.
[19:43.840 --> 19:46.340]  One thing you can do, you can keep that boy separate,
[19:46.340 --> 19:47.560]  flower him out.
[19:47.560 --> 19:50.800]  Around day 14, you'll see him start dropping pollen.
[19:50.800 --> 19:53.800]  Around day 20 to 25 to 30, he'll really be dumping.
[19:53.800 --> 19:56.340]  Go in there with a jar or some sort of receptacle
[19:56.340 --> 19:57.960]  and gather that pollen.
[19:57.960 --> 19:59.940]  Then put it into a container.
[20:01.080 --> 20:03.340]  You want to get, before you put it into a container,
[20:03.340 --> 20:05.720]  you need to get all of the male flowers out.
[20:05.720 --> 20:07.560]  The male flowers hold moisture.
[20:07.560 --> 20:09.140]  Moisture destroys pollen.
[20:09.140 --> 20:11.500]  You have to get all of the moisture out of this pollen
[20:11.500 --> 20:13.160]  if you want it to be viable.
[20:13.160 --> 20:14.920]  If you wanna store it and keep it,
[20:14.920 --> 20:17.760]  you need to get all of the moisture out.
[20:17.760 --> 20:20.120]  Our friend Tony, Mr. Toad, taught us a long time ago
[20:20.120 --> 20:22.640]  about using silicate packets to take the moisture out.
[20:22.640 --> 20:24.880]  So some silicate packets in your container
[20:24.880 --> 20:26.600]  are always a good idea to get the moisture
[20:26.600 --> 20:28.300]  out of your pollen.
[20:28.300 --> 20:30.600]  You can use a screen on top of a jar.
[20:30.600 --> 20:32.120]  You put the screen over the jar.
[20:32.120 --> 20:33.480]  I've seen people use a pantyhose.
[20:33.480 --> 20:34.760]  You stretch it real tight.
[20:34.760 --> 20:35.960]  You just rub with a credit card,
[20:35.960 --> 20:37.400]  rub the pollen through the screen
[20:37.400 --> 20:38.940]  and the male flowers gather up on the top
[20:38.940 --> 20:41.000]  and you just scrape those right off and discard them.
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  Get all the male flowers out of there.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.280]  Or you can just shake that pollen into something
[20:45.280 --> 20:48.880]  like a magazine or a bowl and you can use a paintbrush
[20:48.880 --> 20:51.800]  and go in the other room and just paint a couple of branches
[20:51.800 --> 20:53.000]  with that pollen.
[20:53.000 --> 20:54.660]  It's really hard to control pollen
[20:54.660 --> 20:57.280]  because if you sneeze, you just fucked everything up, man.
[20:57.280 --> 20:59.080]  Everything's flying around the whole room.
[20:59.080 --> 21:00.840]  So be really careful with the pollen.
[21:00.840 --> 21:03.080]  You just need to get it from the plant to the female
[21:03.080 --> 21:04.000]  and apply it carefully.
[21:04.000 --> 21:04.880]  You can do it with a Q-tip.
[21:04.880 --> 21:06.440]  You can do it with a paintbrush.
[21:06.440 --> 21:08.120]  I just do it open pollination style.
[21:08.120 --> 21:10.280]  I let the male do his magic to the girls,
[21:10.280 --> 21:12.160]  just exactly how it's supposed to.
[21:12.160 --> 21:14.160]  They drop pollen, I give them a good shake.
[21:14.160 --> 21:16.720]  The girls receive the pollen, the whole plant is seeded.
[21:16.720 --> 21:19.120]  I know maybe you don't want to pollinate your whole crop,
[21:19.120 --> 21:21.000]  the whole room, but that's an easy way
[21:21.000 --> 21:22.320]  to make plenty of seeds.
[21:22.320 --> 21:25.120]  Honestly, here's something that I just recently did.
[21:25.120 --> 21:26.800]  This works, this is true.
[21:26.800 --> 21:28.680]  I ran my normal breeding program.
[21:28.680 --> 21:31.440]  I put some capeltin, I talked about it on the podcast.
[21:31.440 --> 21:33.120]  I made more seeds of the firefly,
[21:33.120 --> 21:34.680]  I made more morning dew seeds,
[21:34.680 --> 21:36.480]  but I also wanted to make some new crosses
[21:36.480 --> 21:38.860]  and I wanted to make some stuff that was just for me.
[21:38.860 --> 21:40.940]  I wanted to make platinum tangy to arise.
[21:40.940 --> 21:43.300]  I wanted to make canadensial to arise.
[21:43.300 --> 21:45.500]  I took a canadensial and a platinum tangy
[21:45.500 --> 21:46.860]  and there were a couple others.
[21:46.860 --> 21:49.020]  They were in a beer cup, those red solo cups
[21:49.020 --> 21:51.100]  that you get at a party for the keg.
[21:51.100 --> 21:52.940]  I put enough soil in there to fill that up.
[21:52.940 --> 21:54.900]  I put a little plant, a little clone in there
[21:54.900 --> 21:56.940]  and I let it grow, it was probably six or eight inches tall
[21:56.940 --> 21:58.420]  and then I put it into the breeding chamber
[21:58.420 --> 22:00.620]  to flower with all the other big girls.
[22:00.620 --> 22:03.420]  And I got pollen on it just like I did all the big girls.
[22:03.420 --> 22:05.180]  And those plants were maybe a foot tall,
[22:05.180 --> 22:07.100]  maybe 10 to 12 inches tall out of the pot
[22:07.100 --> 22:08.060]  by the time they were finished.
[22:08.060 --> 22:10.300]  I just took one bamboo stick and put it in there
[22:10.300 --> 22:11.740]  and they stayed up real light.
[22:11.740 --> 22:13.980]  I had to lean them up against shit to keep them upright
[22:13.980 --> 22:16.320]  because they got top heavy, but they stayed up.
[22:16.320 --> 22:17.220]  They survived.
[22:17.220 --> 22:18.500]  They made it all the way through the cycle.
[22:18.500 --> 22:19.480]  I harvested them.
[22:19.480 --> 22:22.460]  I got between 30 and 50 seeds from each plant
[22:22.460 --> 22:24.300]  that was in a beer cup.
[22:24.300 --> 22:26.660]  So you need enough light to breed.
[22:26.660 --> 22:29.020]  A 400 watt light doesn't do it for me when I'm breeding.
[22:29.020 --> 22:30.780]  I don't feel like the seeds are robust enough
[22:30.780 --> 22:31.700]  and you don't get enough.
[22:31.700 --> 22:33.060]  A 600 did it.
[22:33.060 --> 22:35.940]  A thousand watt light is really what I like for breeding.
[22:35.940 --> 22:38.200]  I feel like you need that power of that much light
[22:38.200 --> 22:39.780]  to get yourself enough seeds.
[22:40.260 --> 22:41.980]  And then you want to make sure that you have
[22:41.980 --> 22:42.900]  a good amount of seeds.
[22:42.900 --> 22:44.220]  You want to make sure that you have
[22:44.220 --> 22:47.220]  a good amount of seeds and viable seeds.
[22:47.220 --> 22:51.100]  So put just one light worth of small plants,
[22:51.100 --> 22:53.020]  just veg them for a little while to where they're tiny.
[22:53.020 --> 22:55.500]  Put one light in there of girls and one male in there
[22:55.500 --> 22:56.620]  and just let them go.
[22:56.620 --> 22:58.740]  And you will make plenty of seeds for yourself.
[22:58.740 --> 23:01.100]  But like I said, if you just want to pollinate one section,
[23:01.100 --> 23:03.740]  gather that pollen into a container, get a paint brush,
[23:03.740 --> 23:06.340]  dip it into the pollen just like you're gonna do
[23:06.340 --> 23:07.540]  if you're gonna paint.
[23:07.540 --> 23:11.260]  The thickest, most robust pistol lit hairs you can find.
[23:11.260 --> 23:12.660]  That's where you want to put it.
[23:12.660 --> 23:14.620]  You want those thick, robust hairs that are just,
[23:14.620 --> 23:15.860]  ah, they're just ready.
[23:15.860 --> 23:16.860]  Those are the pistols, you guys.
[23:16.860 --> 23:18.420]  That is something we should probably have gone over
[23:18.420 --> 23:19.540]  in the glossary.
[23:19.540 --> 23:20.420]  Quit saying hairs.
[23:20.420 --> 23:21.240]  Those aren't hairs.
[23:21.240 --> 23:22.080]  Those are pistol lit hairs.
[23:22.080 --> 23:24.260]  Those are known as pistols.
[23:24.260 --> 23:26.220]  What their job is is to collect the pollen.
[23:26.220 --> 23:27.800]  They collect the pollen and they slide the pollen
[23:27.800 --> 23:29.580]  right down that and then they continue on.
[23:29.580 --> 23:32.020]  We don't need to talk about what happens after that.
[23:32.020 --> 23:33.940]  But anyway, you can tell that the plant has been pollinated
[23:33.940 --> 23:36.140]  because those pistol lit hairs will turn brown
[23:36.140 --> 23:37.100]  and start crinkling up.
[23:37.660 --> 23:38.900]  Over the next few days, they'll start crinkling up
[23:38.900 --> 23:41.500]  and turning in and they'll all be brown and crunchy.
[23:41.500 --> 23:43.820]  That's a good indicator that that section of the plant
[23:43.820 --> 23:44.920]  has been pollinated.
[23:45.780 --> 23:48.060]  If you want to pollinate one small section of the plant,
[23:48.060 --> 23:50.100]  if you're gonna take pollen into a room
[23:50.100 --> 23:52.020]  and you only want one plant receiving pollen,
[23:52.020 --> 23:54.260]  you can spray water on the rest of the garden
[23:54.260 --> 23:55.860]  and hopefully those plants will not be able
[23:55.860 --> 23:56.700]  to receive pollen.
[23:56.700 --> 23:58.220]  Water deactivates pollen.
[23:58.220 --> 24:00.860]  That's why I'm so stressful about getting all
[24:00.860 --> 24:03.180]  of the male flowers and using a silicate pack
[24:03.180 --> 24:04.460]  in your pollen storage.
[24:05.300 --> 24:07.140]  So spray the rest of the plants.
[24:07.140 --> 24:08.620]  Take your male pollen in there
[24:08.620 --> 24:10.920]  and paintbrush what you need to.
[24:10.920 --> 24:13.900]  And then spray the rest of the plant down also
[24:13.900 --> 24:15.300]  if you feel like that's necessary.
[24:15.300 --> 24:17.840]  Then spray yourself down to deactivate all the pollen
[24:17.840 --> 24:19.580]  because you don't want to take the pollen back
[24:19.580 --> 24:21.640]  into the grow later or to somebody else's grow
[24:21.640 --> 24:23.340]  or anything like that.
[24:23.340 --> 24:24.580]  So the simple answer is yes,
[24:24.580 --> 24:26.420]  you can make a bunch of seeds for yourself
[24:26.420 --> 24:28.400]  so that you don't have to keep clones around.
[24:28.400 --> 24:31.160]  If you're using the male and the female of the same strain,
[24:31.160 --> 24:35.200]  you may be making F2 or F3 or maybe even F4 or 5
[24:35.200 --> 24:36.980]  of the strain that you have purchased.
[24:36.980 --> 24:39.820]  It just depends on what finial generation
[24:39.820 --> 24:43.100]  the breeder you purchased it from has taken it to.
[24:43.100 --> 24:45.320]  I know DJ Short likes to breed things all the way up
[24:45.320 --> 24:47.800]  to like F4 or 5 before he releases them.
[24:47.800 --> 24:49.720]  So it doesn't leave a lot of variation
[24:49.720 --> 24:53.440]  for you breeding it to the F6 or 7 or whatever it's going to,
[24:53.440 --> 24:55.800]  which is going to actually be a good thing for you.
[24:55.800 --> 24:57.520]  There are some breeders like Gage Green,
[24:57.520 --> 24:58.480]  and I'm not calling anybody out.
[24:58.480 --> 24:59.400]  This is just how they work.
[24:59.400 --> 25:00.680]  I'm not saying Gage sucks or anything,
[25:01.200 --> 25:03.560]  but Gage Green is known for releasing F1 hybrids
[25:03.560 --> 25:04.920]  or polyhybrids.
[25:04.920 --> 25:08.400]  So when you breed those, he's given you F1s.
[25:08.400 --> 25:09.480]  You're going to make F2.
[25:09.480 --> 25:11.680]  If you take a male and a female of the same seed stock
[25:11.680 --> 25:12.760]  and you cross them,
[25:13.840 --> 25:17.080]  you are now making an F2 finial generation, kind of.
[25:17.080 --> 25:18.620]  It depends on how the first ones were bred,
[25:18.620 --> 25:19.800]  but for our example here,
[25:19.800 --> 25:22.000]  you're F2ing your varietal.
[25:23.520 --> 25:25.200]  So when you make that F2,
[25:25.200 --> 25:28.280]  a lot of times the F2s are better than the F1s,
[25:28.280 --> 25:29.800]  but you're going to see variance.
[25:29.800 --> 25:32.800]  You're going to see something that looks like grandma,
[25:32.800 --> 25:34.600]  something that looks like grandpa,
[25:34.600 --> 25:37.040]  and they'll be on both sides of the trait chart.
[25:37.040 --> 25:38.840]  So how can I explain this a little better?
[25:38.840 --> 25:41.240]  Let's say you've got a strain like,
[25:41.240 --> 25:42.280]  I'm just going to invent something.
[25:42.280 --> 25:46.060]  Say you've got White Widow crossed to Grateful Dog,
[25:46.060 --> 25:47.360]  which is actually Capleton.
[25:47.360 --> 25:49.760]  And then on the other side, you've got Arise,
[25:49.760 --> 25:52.240]  or we'll say Golden Goat crossed to Daybreaker,
[25:52.240 --> 25:53.160]  which is Arise.
[25:53.160 --> 25:55.600]  If you cross the Arise and the Capleton,
[25:55.600 --> 25:58.080]  you will see traits of all four of the grandparents.
[25:58.080 --> 25:59.760]  You'll see White Widow, Grateful Dog,
[26:00.600 --> 26:03.160]  Golden Goat, and Daybreaker representations in there.
[26:03.160 --> 26:04.560]  But sometimes that's a good thing
[26:04.560 --> 26:05.640]  because some of those plants
[26:05.640 --> 26:07.440]  will outperform the original parents.
[26:07.440 --> 26:10.180]  You will have created more robust, faster growing,
[26:10.180 --> 26:13.240]  more resinous, more desirable plants.
[26:13.240 --> 26:15.320]  You'll find better progeny.
[26:15.320 --> 26:18.160]  And I think the term for that is transgressive segregation.
[26:18.160 --> 26:20.780]  If anybody wants to Google and tell me if I'm right or wrong,
[26:20.780 --> 26:22.600]  I think the term transgressive segregation
[26:22.600 --> 26:25.540]  is going to have something about better performing
[26:25.540 --> 26:28.720]  or extreme or turbo or something like that.
[26:28.720 --> 26:29.800]  I'm not going to say turbo,
[26:29.800 --> 26:31.680]  but it's going to be something like that
[26:31.680 --> 26:33.960]  that indicates transgressive segregation.
[26:33.960 --> 26:36.560]  And I'm just indicating that it outperforms its parents
[26:36.560 --> 26:40.840]  is what I mean by the transgressive segregation term here.
[26:40.840 --> 26:43.800]  But anyway, you'll be making the next finial generation,
[26:43.800 --> 26:44.760]  which is always fun too,
[26:44.760 --> 26:47.900]  because you'll either be stabilizing it
[26:47.900 --> 26:50.200]  or you'll find one that's way different
[26:50.200 --> 26:51.040]  that you like better.
[26:51.040 --> 26:52.640]  You'll have a lot of fun with that.
[26:52.640 --> 26:54.600]  And then you'll have different phenotypes
[26:54.600 --> 26:56.280]  of seeds that you created.
[26:56.280 --> 26:58.120]  And this whole problem of having to keep
[26:58.120 --> 26:59.240]  a whole bunch of strains around
[26:59.240 --> 27:02.960]  is only going to compound itself once you start making seeds.
[27:02.960 --> 27:04.720]  Trust me on that.
[27:04.720 --> 27:06.200]  That's how you get into plant hoarding.
[27:06.200 --> 27:07.560]  That's how you end up buying a warehouse.
[27:07.560 --> 27:08.880]  That's how you end up just going big
[27:08.880 --> 27:11.780]  and ended up as a breeder and having tons of shit.
[27:12.640 --> 27:13.480]  Good luck.
[27:13.480 --> 27:15.360]  Also, here's something that we should talk about, timing.
[27:15.360 --> 27:16.400]  You're talking about breeding.
[27:16.400 --> 27:17.680]  Timing is crucial when you're breeding.
[27:17.680 --> 27:18.660]  If you want to make seeds,
[27:18.660 --> 27:19.840]  if you want to make a lot of seeds,
[27:19.840 --> 27:21.020]  if you want to make it worth your time,
[27:21.020 --> 27:22.160]  timing is very important.
[27:22.160 --> 27:23.600]  It's a good idea to have the male
[27:23.600 --> 27:24.720]  a little bit ahead of the females.
[27:24.720 --> 27:26.240]  If you've got the male and the female,
[27:26.240 --> 27:27.960]  if you start them flowering at the same exact time
[27:27.960 --> 27:29.440]  next to each other, you'll get plenty of seeds.
[27:29.440 --> 27:32.800]  If you want a lot of seeds, I suggest you let the male
[27:32.800 --> 27:35.780]  flower, I got a fly flying in my face, sorry.
[27:35.780 --> 27:38.680]  I suggest you let the male flower
[27:38.680 --> 27:40.720]  start him off 10 to 14 days early.
[27:40.720 --> 27:43.200]  Get him flowering, keep him away from the girls.
[27:43.200 --> 27:46.360]  Then put the girls in the flower 10 to 14 days after that.
[27:46.360 --> 27:48.720]  You will see the male starting to dump pollen
[27:48.720 --> 27:51.800]  around day 14, pollen will start coming out.
[27:51.800 --> 27:53.080]  Pollen will really start coming out
[27:53.080 --> 27:55.100]  around day 25, around day 30.
[27:55.940 --> 28:00.020]  Your girl plants are going to want pollen around day,
[28:00.020 --> 28:01.100]  kind of depending on the strain,
[28:01.100 --> 28:05.260]  but around day 23 through 32-ish,
[28:05.260 --> 28:08.340]  maybe 25 through 32-ish, depending on the strain.
[28:08.340 --> 28:10.740]  Now one thing I've noticed, if I'm breeding for firefly,
[28:10.740 --> 28:12.960]  I need to put the lemon skunk plant
[28:12.960 --> 28:15.020]  into the flowering room much earlier
[28:15.020 --> 28:16.940]  because it needs to develop those tall buds
[28:16.940 --> 28:18.940]  and start getting a lot of pistils on those tall buds.
[28:18.940 --> 28:21.380]  If I pollinate it too soon, it quits growing
[28:21.380 --> 28:23.540]  and I don't give it enough bud sites
[28:23.580 --> 28:24.940]  to actually receive enough pollen
[28:24.940 --> 28:26.860]  to make it worth a shit to breed to.
[28:26.860 --> 28:28.900]  So I put the lemon skunk plant in there
[28:28.900 --> 28:31.940]  a little bit earlier, then about four or five days later,
[28:31.940 --> 28:33.460]  I'll put capelton in there.
[28:33.460 --> 28:36.900]  And then a few days later, I will put whatever,
[28:36.900 --> 28:39.400]  a kalonji cush in there.
[28:39.400 --> 28:41.900]  And then I will pollinate them all at the same time
[28:41.900 --> 28:44.100]  because they will all have gotten to the right
[28:44.100 --> 28:46.540]  ovulation point is basically what that is.
[28:46.540 --> 28:49.760]  So timing is very crucial when you're trying to breed.
[28:49.760 --> 28:51.320]  Like I said, if you just want to make a few seeds
[28:51.320 --> 28:54.280]  for yourself, put them in there on the same day,
[28:54.280 --> 28:55.400]  let it all happen naturally,
[28:55.400 --> 28:58.080]  or set that male plant in another room, collect the pollen.
[28:58.080 --> 29:00.960]  You can just set it on a ceramic plate or on a mirror,
[29:00.960 --> 29:02.480]  or you could just tap it every couple of days
[29:02.480 --> 29:03.720]  and get some pollen out of it
[29:03.720 --> 29:05.620]  until you've got enough to do what you think you need to do.
[29:05.620 --> 29:09.000]  It does not take a lot of pollen to make plenty of seeds.
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.080]  You can make a lot of seeds with one male plant.
[29:12.080 --> 29:13.840]  Just for a reference point,
[29:13.840 --> 29:15.440]  I'm not sure how much I should talk about this,
[29:15.440 --> 29:17.400]  but a plant in a beer cup,
[29:17.400 --> 29:20.320]  I can pull 30 to 50 seeds from if done properly.
[29:20.320 --> 29:22.000]  Oh, also I should mention, I forgot to mention this.
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.300]  I will pollinate twice sometimes.
[29:24.300 --> 29:26.060]  I'll hit the plants one time
[29:26.060 --> 29:27.480]  and then I'll give them three to five days
[29:27.480 --> 29:29.080]  and I will go back and repollinate
[29:29.080 --> 29:30.920]  just to make sure that I got them sufficiently.
[29:30.920 --> 29:32.040]  That's something I forgot to mention.
[29:32.040 --> 29:33.040]  I will go back.
[29:33.040 --> 29:33.880]  Now, what was I saying?
[29:33.880 --> 29:36.480]  Okay, I can get about 30 to 50 seeds
[29:36.480 --> 29:38.280]  from a plant in a beer cup.
[29:38.280 --> 29:41.800]  In a three gallon pot, a plant that I grow about a foot,
[29:41.800 --> 29:43.680]  maybe two feet tall before I flower it,
[29:43.680 --> 29:46.820]  it ends up about three, three and a half feet tall usually.
[29:46.820 --> 29:48.880]  Depending on the strain, you guys,
[29:48.880 --> 29:53.620]  I will get 500 to 1,000 seeds out of a plant like that.
[29:53.620 --> 29:56.080]  So if you're making seeds for yourself,
[29:56.080 --> 29:57.440]  you only have to do that once
[29:57.440 --> 29:59.320]  and then you've got 1,000 seeds to work with
[29:59.320 --> 30:01.320]  and that should last you a long time
[30:01.320 --> 30:04.120]  unless you're running huge numbers, which is ridiculous.
[30:04.120 --> 30:07.400]  But imagine how many plants under that,
[30:07.400 --> 30:09.580]  you can fit nine of those three gallon pots
[30:09.580 --> 30:10.760]  under a light comfortably,
[30:10.760 --> 30:12.680]  maybe 12 if you cram them in there,
[30:12.680 --> 30:14.560]  maybe 16 if you really fucking force them in,
[30:14.560 --> 30:15.840]  but I don't like to do that.
[30:16.000 --> 30:19.160]  I usually do about nine three gallon pots
[30:19.160 --> 30:21.440]  and then or maybe nine five gallon pots
[30:21.440 --> 30:23.160]  and then just around the outer edge there,
[30:23.160 --> 30:25.480]  I do a couple of cups just for experiments.
[30:25.480 --> 30:26.600]  So when I'm making commercial seed,
[30:26.600 --> 30:28.220]  that's how that works.
[30:28.220 --> 30:30.400]  Per 1,000 watt light, I got about nine plants,
[30:30.400 --> 30:32.200]  probably get 500 seeds on average,
[30:32.200 --> 30:34.680]  1,000, the redheaded stranger will give me 1,000 seeds
[30:34.680 --> 30:37.320]  because that plant just makes a bunch of heads.
[30:37.320 --> 30:40.320]  Kalonji Kush on the other hand, I'll get closer to 500.
[30:40.320 --> 30:42.640]  Just kind of depends on the strain.
[30:42.640 --> 30:43.560]  Anyway, I don't know how much of that
[30:43.560 --> 30:45.800]  I should be talking about, so don't tell anybody.
[30:46.680 --> 30:47.520]  I hope I answered your question
[30:47.520 --> 30:48.340]  about making seeds for yourself.
[30:48.340 --> 30:51.680]  It is not as hard or scary as it sounds, you guys.
[30:51.680 --> 30:54.080]  People get really intimidated when it comes to male plants
[30:54.080 --> 30:55.100]  and breeding and stuff like that,
[30:55.100 --> 30:57.460]  but it's nature, it's really easy to do.
[30:57.460 --> 31:00.980]  The hardest part is not pollinating stuff on accident.
[31:00.980 --> 31:02.440]  And something super important to think about
[31:02.440 --> 31:03.440]  is don't go to the grocery store,
[31:03.440 --> 31:05.040]  don't go to the dispensary,
[31:05.040 --> 31:06.640]  don't go around any of your friends that grow,
[31:06.640 --> 31:08.400]  don't go to anybody's grow.
[31:08.400 --> 31:10.320]  If you work at a grow, stay the fuck away from there
[31:10.320 --> 31:13.480]  until you have completely showered, changed your clothes,
[31:13.760 --> 31:15.960]  gotten totally wet because you need to deactivate
[31:15.960 --> 31:17.160]  all of that pollen.
[31:17.160 --> 31:19.640]  Be careful, don't be that guy that goes and pollinates
[31:19.640 --> 31:21.240]  everybody's garden on accident.
[31:22.320 --> 31:24.120]  All right, you guys, I've been going for 30,
[31:24.120 --> 31:25.320]  just over 31 minutes here,
[31:25.320 --> 31:27.820]  and I haven't taken much of a break or a drink or anything.
[31:27.820 --> 31:29.640]  I did take a dab in the middle of the show,
[31:29.640 --> 31:31.600]  but I think it's time to start wrapping up the podcast.
[31:31.600 --> 31:34.040]  I want to thank everybody for listening to another episode.
[31:34.040 --> 31:36.200]  I hope you enjoyed everything I said,
[31:36.200 --> 31:37.800]  even if I had to correct you on something.
[31:37.800 --> 31:40.320]  Don't take it personally, even if it was personal at you.
[31:40.320 --> 31:42.620]  I want you to be a better person.
[31:43.920 --> 31:44.760]  You guys, thanks for listening.
[31:44.760 --> 31:45.720]  If you learn anything from the show,
[31:45.720 --> 31:46.880]  don't forget about Patreon.
[31:46.880 --> 31:48.520]  Patreon is a great way to say thank you.

[32:14.040 --> 32:14.920]  You just saw how I did it.
[32:14.920 --> 32:16.440]  I had a random stack of emails.
[32:16.440 --> 32:17.720]  There's about 12 of them in the pile.
[32:17.720 --> 32:19.400]  I shuffled through and I pulled out the seventh one
[32:19.400 --> 32:20.680]  is what I think I did.
[32:20.680 --> 32:22.280]  So I read the seventh email in the pile,
[32:22.280 --> 32:23.440]  which was totally random.
[32:23.440 --> 32:25.600]  No favoritism or anything like that.

[33:07.100 --> 33:09.940]  that was grown at Three Rivers.
[33:09.940 --> 33:11.420]  The Three Rivers grow in Pueblo West
[33:11.460 --> 33:14.500]  and it has got about 2,200 likes,
[33:14.500 --> 33:16.780]  which is the most likes I've ever gotten on a photo.
[33:16.780 --> 33:18.180]  I would love it if you take a look at it.
[33:18.180 --> 33:20.360]  Click like, you might love it also.
[33:20.360 --> 33:23.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, that dab is still ringing in my brain.
[33:23.700 --> 33:26.120]  I think it's time for me to get a drink and some food.
[33:26.120 --> 33:28.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, the beautiful Dabbing Granny
[33:28.340 --> 33:29.620]  fell down some stairs recently
[33:29.620 --> 33:31.240]  and she hurt her foot really bad.
[33:31.240 --> 33:32.940]  She's got a busted up, anyway,
[33:32.940 --> 33:35.220]  she fucked her shit up real good.
[33:35.220 --> 33:37.480]  And we need to give her all the love we can send to her.
[33:37.480 --> 33:38.460]  So whatever you believe in,
[33:38.460 --> 33:39.300]  whatever you think about,
[33:39.300 --> 33:40.460]  send love and light to Dabbing Granny.
[33:40.460 --> 33:44.140]  She's got a busted ankle, ankle, toes, foot region.
[33:44.140 --> 33:45.780]  Her ankle and foot is in a cast
[33:45.780 --> 33:47.140]  and her toes are sticking out of the cast
[33:47.140 --> 33:49.460]  and it looks like a package of Vienna sausages.
[33:49.460 --> 33:50.720]  She's pretty swollen up.
[33:50.720 --> 33:51.720]  She's pretty purple.
[33:51.720 --> 33:54.580]  She's gonna be okay, but she needs some love, some light.
[33:54.580 --> 33:55.700]  She needs her spirits lifted.
[33:55.700 --> 33:57.500]  She can only dab so hard.
[33:57.500 --> 33:59.120]  Let's all send a huge gigantic shout out
[33:59.120 --> 34:00.200]  to the Dabbing Granny.
[34:00.200 --> 34:02.560]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[34:02.560 --> 34:04.060]  and give your mom a hug for me.
