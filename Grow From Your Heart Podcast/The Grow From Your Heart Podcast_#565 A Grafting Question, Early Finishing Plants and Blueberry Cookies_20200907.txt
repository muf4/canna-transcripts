[01:02.580 --> 01:09.040]  about what I'm smoking. Today I've been taking dabs of TK 91 full spectrum extract from green
[01:09.040 --> 01:14.800]  dot labs. This is a blend of chem 91 and triangle cush on the package. The flavor is simply
[01:14.800 --> 01:21.760]  described as chem, OG, cush and gas. I could not have said it better myself. This is delicious
[01:21.760 --> 01:26.680]  and is potent. It's got some great chem notes to it. It's got those OG cush notes to it.
[01:26.680 --> 01:32.040]  When you dab it, it leaves a bitter sour gas flavor on my tongue and I completely fucking
[01:32.040 --> 01:39.020]  love it. The back of the package says that it does contain 76.9% total THC and non detectable
[01:39.020 --> 01:43.800]  amounts of CBD. I'm showing the remnants of this package to the camera here. Not much
[01:43.800 --> 01:47.800]  left you can see the beautiful color. You can see the turp sauce left in the jar. Nice
[01:47.800 --> 01:53.800]  ratio of turp sauce to crystals. Great concentrate got me nice and buzzy. Nice and rambly. I
[01:53.800 --> 02:00.920]  really like the TK 91 full spectrum extract. All right, in this episode, I am going to
[02:00.920 --> 02:05.600]  answer a couple of Patreon questions. Before we get there. Let's do some shout outs to
[02:05.600 --> 02:09.960]  some folks who support the show on Patreon. Let's start off with the big grow from your
[02:09.960 --> 02:13.880]  heart podcast. Thank you. Shout out to our friend OG purple thumb. Let's send a big thank
[02:13.880 --> 02:19.120]  you shout out to ADHD grower. I want to send a big thank you shout out to Josiah W. I've
[02:19.120 --> 02:23.040]  always got a big thank you shout out for Dominic see, I always want to send a big thank you
[02:23.040 --> 02:26.840]  shout out to dabbing Mike. No, I got that backwards. It is correct. Either way. It's
[02:26.840 --> 02:30.900]  dabbing Mike and the dabbing queen but this should be giant Mike and the dabbing queen
[02:30.900 --> 02:35.360]  is who I owe the shout out to. I also want to send a thank you shout out to just a smoking
[02:35.360 --> 02:39.800]  me to bro just a smoking. Let's also send a big thank you shout out to my friend Tim.
[02:39.800 --> 02:44.680]  I've always got a thank you shout out for Xavier. And last but certainly not least,
[02:44.680 --> 02:48.480]  let's send a big grow from your heart podcast. Thank you. Shout out and a fist bump to our
[02:48.480 --> 02:53.080]  friend Terp burglar. Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports the show on
[02:53.080 --> 02:56.600]  Patreon. If you're not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to
[02:56.600 --> 03:03.640]  do so all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart all of
[03:03.640 --> 03:07.400]  the information you need will be right there on the screen. I do try to make it nice and
[03:07.400 --> 03:11.200]  easy for all of my friends. All right, we're going to fade this music out and we were going
[03:11.200 --> 03:16.040]  to get down to business. Thanks again for joining me guys in the last episode. I did
[03:16.040 --> 03:20.840]  make a small mistake that we were going to edit out right now. We're going to fix that
[03:20.840 --> 03:26.240]  the corrections department did chime in rather quickly during the premiere of the insta of
[03:26.240 --> 03:30.640]  the YouTube video. I got a bunch of comments that said yo, you said that wrong. I said
[03:30.640 --> 03:34.640]  that the Rev wrote some books and the Rev did not write the books. I gave him credit
[03:34.640 --> 03:40.440]  for the teaming with series actually came from Jeff Lohenfels. So I gave the Rev credit
[03:40.440 --> 03:45.000]  for books. He didn't write I did not give Jeff Lohenfels credit. So I need to give Jeff
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.120]  Lohenfels a shout out for some of his books. I don't agree with a lot of his techniques,
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.360]  but he still deserves credit for the damn books. He wrote I want credit for my work
[03:53.360 --> 03:58.040]  shout out to Jeff Lohenfels. It is okay to disagree with people. He disagrees with me.
[03:58.040 --> 04:01.800]  I disagree with him and guess what? We could still be friends. I would still smoke a joint
[04:01.800 --> 04:04.960]  with him. I'd still have dinner with him. If I saw him broke down the highway, I could
[04:04.960 --> 04:09.080]  pull over and help him out. It's okay to disagree. Just disagree with some shit, but still the
[04:09.080 --> 04:13.720]  man gets credit for his hard work. All right. I did say I was going to read some Patreon
[04:13.720 --> 04:18.200]  messages. Let's quit rambling about silly shit and get right to the point here. The
[04:18.200 --> 04:23.320]  first Patreon message on today's episode goes a lot like this. It comes from our friends
[04:23.320 --> 04:27.440]  smoke what I know what you're smoking, bro. It says, hey, Jeff, nothing important, but
[04:27.440 --> 04:32.320]  a random thought I want to see if you know anything about these are my favorites. These
[04:32.320 --> 04:37.320]  turn out to be some of the best. It said with such limited plant counts, is it possible
[04:37.320 --> 04:42.280]  to graft these plants together to make a super mother? I know you've joked about grafting
[04:42.280 --> 04:46.260]  before, but if you could have a plant with five strains grafted together, you could turn
[04:46.260 --> 04:51.600]  into five different strains with one mother and stay legal. It says you could. Then it
[04:51.600 --> 04:58.200]  says hope you have a good day. Just a high thought for the day. Um, I have read, seen,
[04:58.200 --> 05:04.040]  heard a lot of grafting. It is not for me. I'm a breeder who breeds. Uh, I want my seeds
[05:04.040 --> 05:09.400]  to be very reliable. I want my strains to be very distinct. If I grow strawberry starburst,
[05:09.400 --> 05:15.880]  I expect strawberry starburst. If I grow sun kiss, I want sun kiss. I don't know the biology
[05:15.880 --> 05:21.880]  behind this. I don't have the science behind this. I feel like if I took, so the idea behind
[05:21.880 --> 05:27.560]  grafting would be to find a plant with a very quality root stock. Some plants don't root
[05:27.560 --> 05:32.220]  well. Some plants don't veg well. Some plants make shitty weak stocks. Uh, we could take
[05:32.220 --> 05:36.680]  one stock that grows well and we could put a little slit in the stem and you could take
[05:36.680 --> 05:40.700]  a cutting off of another plant, put it in there, tape it to where it stays safe. Maybe
[05:40.700 --> 05:43.960]  apply some gel in there. I don't know what you'd put in there. This is not my, my gig,
[05:43.960 --> 05:49.240]  my bag. Uh, but then that branch from the other plant, let's just say the sun kiss branch
[05:49.240 --> 05:56.100]  is now on a strawberry starburst mother plant stock. So now essentially in that plant, theoretically
[05:56.100 --> 06:00.760]  I can cut clones up here of strawberry starburst and off this branch I can cut clones of sun
[06:00.760 --> 06:06.240]  kiss. So like this listener is saying that we could have multiple mother plants on one
[06:06.240 --> 06:11.120]  plant because here in Colorado we are limited to plants. We can only have 12 so I've only
[06:11.120 --> 06:15.220]  got enough mother plants to where I can breed and still have room. I've got mother plant
[06:15.220 --> 06:18.840]  stock and those are my moms and then I've got a few more that I can breed too so that
[06:18.840 --> 06:22.600]  I've got six more to work with or whatever. I were allowed to have six and veg and six
[06:22.600 --> 06:26.800]  and flower. If you've got a med card without the med card, you only get six. Luckily I've
[06:26.800 --> 06:30.840]  got my six plants. Uh, the state offers me and then the six through my medical marijuana
[06:30.840 --> 06:36.160]  card. So, um, I am limited by numbers. If I were to graft four or five different strains
[06:36.160 --> 06:42.600]  to one plant that would dramatically increase my catalog. But I don't like that for some
[06:42.600 --> 06:47.480]  reason. I like having a pot right there that I know is a rise and that pot right there
[06:47.480 --> 06:53.560]  is strawberry starburst. I, I'm not into grafting. It looks and feels like it takes way too much
[06:53.560 --> 06:58.360]  time to be effective for me. That is just for me. I'm on a very different path. I've
[06:58.360 --> 07:04.200]  seen it done very well, but I feel like, so I'm doing a lot of my stuff. My mom plants
[07:04.200 --> 07:08.520]  are kept for a long time. That's kept for preservation and the time that it would take
[07:08.520 --> 07:13.720]  somebody to graft a plant. I've probably already grown out that mother plant, cut a bunch of
[07:13.720 --> 07:18.920]  clones off of it and then flowered the mother plant and started with the fresh clone. So
[07:18.920 --> 07:24.040]  it takes a long time. Also, I feel like eventually those, I don't know that this is real. I feel
[07:24.040 --> 07:28.560]  like those genetics will move together. Like my strawberry will start being orange and
[07:28.560 --> 07:33.280]  whatever plant I grafted up here, we'll start getting both of those. And I feel like genetically
[07:33.360 --> 07:38.720]  somehow that's not going to do what I need done for preservation of unique genetics.
[07:38.720 --> 07:44.120]  I don't have science behind that. That is my hunch, my feeling. I've never read about
[07:44.120 --> 07:49.280]  that, but I don't like the idea. I would rather have my own individual mothers. It is a wonderful
[07:49.280 --> 07:54.400]  idea. It's a great, useful tactic. They do this in apples is quite a, quite a common
[07:54.400 --> 07:58.920]  thing. They don't want to grow. Some apples grow very weak. Some of the trunks and stalks
[07:58.920 --> 08:02.800]  of apple trees. I'm just talking out of my ass from things I've heard on probably on
[08:02.800 --> 08:07.240]  a public radios where I think I heard this, honestly. NPR is really where I think I heard
[08:07.240 --> 08:12.200]  this talk. But the, the main stock is good on some apple trees. It's shitty on some.
[08:12.200 --> 08:16.640]  So they take a fucking graft of one and they stick it right into that good root stock.
[08:16.640 --> 08:20.660]  Then they've got a good trunk with 20 different kinds of apples. And also they'll plant it
[08:20.660 --> 08:24.480]  out to where this branch is one kind that finishes early in the season. This branch
[08:24.480 --> 08:27.960]  finishes a little later. This one finishes later and this one finishes at the end of
[08:27.960 --> 08:33.640]  the season. So that one tree is dropping fruit in a spiral for the whole apple season,
[08:33.640 --> 08:36.840]  which is really cool. Really unique. If you run a big ass apple orchard, that is the way
[08:36.840 --> 08:42.680]  to do it. Apples. They don't, I don't know if that mixes in the apples. I really don't
[08:42.680 --> 08:47.080]  know. Apple, are they as critical with their apple varietals as they are cannabis? Like
[08:47.080 --> 08:51.080]  if you get a fucking granny Smith and it tastes a little bit like a pink lady, are you fucking
[08:51.080 --> 08:56.040]  furious? As a breeder who's breeding with these plants, I can't run that sort of a risk.
[08:56.040 --> 09:00.280]  If you're doing it as a personal project, if it's your hobby, your medicine, you can
[09:00.280 --> 09:04.360]  do that. I can't rely on that as a breeder. People are buying the seeds that I make from
[09:04.360 --> 09:08.120]  these grafted plants. That wouldn't work for me. I wouldn't rely on it. So I feel like
[09:08.120 --> 09:12.920]  I've rambled on enough about that. I hope I gave you some sort of a decent answer. I
[09:12.920 --> 09:17.680]  gave you my opinion. That's what you come here for. So Smoke What? Thank you for the
[09:17.680 --> 09:21.400]  Patreon contribution. Of course, Smoke What's message got rushed up to the top of the email
[09:21.400 --> 09:25.880]  list because of the Patreon contributions. Those do help you out. Patreon.com forward slash
[09:25.880 --> 09:29.960]  grow from your heart. Thank you for the continued support. I do see you on here a lot. Every time
[09:29.960 --> 09:34.440]  I see your name, I go smoke what? I don't know why I say it like that, but I do. So you're in
[09:34.440 --> 09:39.160]  my head, bro. You're renting space in my head for free. Behave in there. Be cool. And thank you
[09:39.160 --> 09:43.560]  again for the great message. He wraps it up with have a good day. Just a high thought for the day,
[09:43.560 --> 09:48.680]  bro. Keep having high thoughts and don't be shy to send them my way. I have a lot of high
[09:48.680 --> 09:52.440]  thoughts too. Most of them end up here on a podcast. All right, we're going to keep moving.
[09:52.440 --> 09:57.960]  This one says my friend Rasta Jeff with a lot of A's and Rasta. It goes on to say,
[09:57.960 --> 10:04.120]  first, let me tell you that the grow from your heart podcast is the most positive vibes available.
[10:04.120 --> 10:08.440]  The most pleasant one to listen to. Thank you. That means a lot to me. I try to be a positive,
[10:08.440 --> 10:13.720]  upbeat dude. There's no sense in being negative. There's enough problems and bullshit going on. I
[10:13.720 --> 10:17.560]  don't need to contribute to that. Let's put out some positive. We're growing weed here. We're
[10:17.560 --> 10:22.600]  taking dabs and growing weed. There's nothing to be mad about in this show. Let's keep going. I get
[10:22.600 --> 10:27.640]  rambly today. It says, that's why I finally got my wife to help me becoming a Patreon member.
[10:27.640 --> 10:32.280]  And when we finish the process, I am really happy with that. You guys, some of this message is hard
[10:32.280 --> 10:35.720]  to read and you'll understand here in just another paragraph, you'll get why some of the words are
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.920]  broken up, but they finally got their wife to allow them to become a patron. So thank you for
[10:40.920 --> 10:46.840]  the support. Big thank you to your wife. Without a good wife behind every good grower, we may just
[10:46.840 --> 10:51.000]  lose our fucking minds without somebody on our team, keeping an eye on us. You guys may just lose
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.880]  your shit. Your whole house would be filled with plants. You'd never take a shower. Things may go
[10:55.880 --> 11:01.960]  wrong. So let's keep it going. Keep moving. It says, I am the Brazilian grower who also happens
[11:01.960 --> 11:07.400]  to be blind, who contacted you several weeks ago. I was so impressed with you being blind. I don't
[11:07.400 --> 11:12.840]  think I acknowledged that you were Brazilian. Your English comes out pretty damn well. I put the
[11:12.840 --> 11:17.240]  language barrier to being blind, but now also you're blind and Brazilian. So there's a language
[11:17.240 --> 11:23.640]  barrier there and you're doing amazingly well. So we've got a blind friend who is growing, who is
[11:23.640 --> 11:28.600]  also Brazilian. It says, my name is, they leave, I'm going to skip their real name, but it says,
[11:28.600 --> 11:32.840]  you can call me Brazil if you happen to read this on the podcast. What up Brazil? Good to see you
[11:32.840 --> 11:37.720]  again. It says, reading my email on the podcast is not important for me, but if you could try to help
[11:37.720 --> 11:42.600]  me answering my question. Well, my friend, I liked your question. So we're going to get it on the show.
[11:42.600 --> 11:46.520]  It says, here it goes. I've been growing different strains from different breeders. They list the
[11:46.520 --> 11:50.760]  breeders. I'm not going to include that just to keep, protect the innocent. It says, I'm growing
[11:50.760 --> 11:56.920]  them in a light depth setup in which I have a veg and flowering indoor grow with a four. Okay. Let's
[11:56.920 --> 12:03.400]  see. I'm growing them in a light depth setup in which I have a veg and a flowering indoor grow.
[12:03.400 --> 12:07.240]  So they might be doing this indoors. I'm not sure if they mean a light depth outdoors or a
[12:07.240 --> 12:11.560]  light depth indoor. We're going to make it work for them with four plants in total
[12:11.560 --> 12:17.800]  and eight, seven liters. So those are around two and a half gallon pots in feeding and soil feeding
[12:17.800 --> 12:22.600]  a hundred percent homemade organic ferts. In the morning, I take my plants out of the grows and I
[12:22.600 --> 12:27.080]  put them in the direct sun for a whole day. And then the end of the day before the sunset, I put
[12:27.080 --> 12:32.520]  back in the grow where they finish 17 hours of light. If they are in veg or 12, if they are in
[12:32.520 --> 12:37.720]  flowering, the results have been great. All of the plants finish healthily with the normal
[12:37.720 --> 12:42.680]  yellowing of the fan leaves and between 10 to 30% brown trichomes. It sounds like this person knows
[12:42.680 --> 12:47.480]  what they're doing so far and they are blind. Keep that in mind. You guys, if you've ever thought I
[12:47.480 --> 12:51.640]  can't do it, I'm not good enough. I'm not strong enough, smart enough, fast enough, able enough.
[12:52.840 --> 12:57.560]  Think again, bro. This person is blind and they're fucking doing it. So if a blind grower can get up
[12:57.560 --> 13:02.360]  and run a light depth, you can do anything. Okay. We can all do more than we think we're capable of.
[13:02.360 --> 13:07.640]  Use this person as inspiration. Use this person as a reason to wipe away your fucking excuses.
[13:07.640 --> 13:12.120]  Wash the sand out of your vag and let's get moving and do some shit. The blind guy is doing better
[13:12.120 --> 13:16.040]  than you. Don't let that happen. I'm due to let that good job blind guy. I'm not, but I'm fucking,
[13:16.040 --> 13:19.960]  come on. He's blind. You have no fucking excuse. He's blind and he's killing it. I'm proud of him.
[13:19.960 --> 13:25.160]  I want to be proud of you too. Get up, do some shit. It says the thing I don't understand,
[13:25.160 --> 13:28.920]  and this is where it gets interesting. You guys, so far, let's recap a little bit. Sounds like a
[13:28.920 --> 13:34.760]  great grow. The plants are going outdoors during the daytime. They get 17 hours of light if they're
[13:34.760 --> 13:39.640]  in veg and 12 hours of light if they're in flower. Then they move, they get moved back indoors. The
[13:39.640 --> 13:44.360]  grower is happy with the results. They're seeing normal yellowing of fan leaves, which is normal
[13:44.360 --> 13:49.400]  fading and 10 to 30% Brown, which is probably Amber trichomes, which has gone the right direction.
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.880]  So we're going to jump into the part they don't understand. Nothing I found online about it is
[13:53.880 --> 14:00.440]  why all my plants finish around 30% sooner than the breeders estimated flowering time. If the
[14:00.440 --> 14:05.480]  breeder says it finishes around 70 days of flowering, my plan will finish 21 days sooner
[14:05.480 --> 14:13.880]  at about 49 days. Um, that's amazing because usually a breeder will lessen the time on the
[14:13.880 --> 14:17.880]  package. They'll say, yeah, this takes eight weeks to flower. It's going to take nine. If the breeder
[14:17.880 --> 14:23.240]  says eight, expect nine. So for you to get stuff that is quicker, more quickly than finishing more
[14:23.240 --> 14:27.720]  quickly than the breeder says, ah, that's really amazing. I'm not sure what's happening, but we're
[14:27.720 --> 14:32.200]  going to keep reading. Uh, it says right now I'm flowering a Northern lights from Sensi seeds,
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.640]  but the flowering time is supposed to be around 48 days. I'm in the 28th day with all white trichomes
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.280]  in the first one changing to Brown. So I'm expecting to harvest in five days time again,
[14:42.280 --> 14:47.960]  30% ahead from indication of the breeder. Okay. This is leading to me leading me to believe that
[14:47.960 --> 14:53.320]  you may be harvesting a little bit too early. You're saying you're satisfied, but let's leave
[14:53.320 --> 14:59.000]  some of these plants to go 65. Let's try it 60. You're cutting down way early. Let's see what
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.880]  happens. If you let a plant go at 60 days, let's see what happens. If you go 65, I really want to
[15:03.880 --> 15:09.480]  know what happens. If you go 70, I'm not sure why this is happening. I don't know what is causing
[15:09.480 --> 15:14.840]  your plants to be finished 20 to 30 days earlier than they should be. I'm very curious. There's
[15:14.840 --> 15:19.640]  more to this. So let's keep reading. It says I have no problem with this. Yeah, me too, bro. If
[15:19.640 --> 15:25.560]  my plants finished in 40 days, 50 days, I would be ecstatic. It says the yields have been great
[15:25.560 --> 15:30.840]  and the plants have there's sticky pages. Here we go. The plant show no sign of stress, but I want
[15:30.840 --> 15:36.200]  to understand what is happening. Then they offer a theory. My theory is that it happens because I
[15:36.200 --> 15:41.000]  give my plants about 10 hours of direct sunlight and compliment that with extra hours under the
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.040]  LED lamps of the grow rooms. So the plants have lots of energy, plenty of organic food,
[15:46.040 --> 15:50.680]  and that accelerates their metabolism, making them flower faster. What do you think about that?
[15:51.480 --> 15:55.480]  They're flowering quite quickly, but it still takes time for trichomes to mature.
[15:55.480 --> 15:59.960]  Trichomes have to amber out. They have to do, I don't know the proper term for what happens inside
[15:59.960 --> 16:08.280]  of a trichome. It has to fucking happen. And that usually takes quite a bit of time. So I don't know
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.760]  about your theory. I can't agree or disagree with it. I don't know that that's right.
[16:12.760 --> 16:19.560]  I have no way to disprove or prove it. I honestly think that the trichomes are not as ready as
[16:19.560 --> 16:23.880]  you're thinking they are. And I want you to let them go longer and scope them and then compare
[16:23.880 --> 16:29.640]  your 30 day that you thought was ready to a 60 day or a 50 day. And let's see if you're actually
[16:29.640 --> 16:34.680]  ready or maybe even better. Send us some pictures. If you send some photos of the trichomes, if you
[16:34.680 --> 16:39.160]  can get them on your camera, I understand that you yourself are blind. I'm asking for photos from
[16:39.160 --> 16:43.400]  a blind guy. I get it, but you're awesome already. You're able to do a lot of things. Maybe you can
[16:43.400 --> 16:50.680]  get me on this email. For a blind person from Brazil, this email is better written, better
[16:50.680 --> 16:56.040]  grammar, better English than a lot of the people who are Americans who are supposed to speak English
[16:56.040 --> 17:02.120]  who can see. So this dude is a bad motherfucker for being blind. I would like to see some photos.
[17:02.120 --> 17:05.800]  Send me a photo of some trichomes. Send me a photo of some plants that you think are done
[17:05.800 --> 17:10.840]  at this early phase and I will give my honest opinion and we will help you out. If your plants
[17:10.840 --> 17:16.040]  are finishing this early, congratulations. Don't change a thing. Teach us all how to do this. I'm
[17:16.040 --> 17:20.600]  proud and excited for you. But I really think if we go a little bit further, your plants will be
[17:20.600 --> 17:26.840]  better. You may think that you're blind. So not to be disrespectful, I'm curious if you're misjudging
[17:26.840 --> 17:30.520]  the color or if someone that's helping you is misjudging. I want to give you some guidance,
[17:30.520 --> 17:35.000]  some friendly advice, help you out. Use my gift of sight and see if we can help you out. So send
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.040]  me some pictures if you're able to. I've got a scope that hooks up to my computer. It's called
[17:40.040 --> 17:44.120]  a Dino Light Scope. It was about, it was a hundred bucks back in the day. They're like 40 bucks now
[17:44.120 --> 17:49.560]  on Amazon. If you can order from Amazon, get it. It hooks up to the USB in my computer. I hold the
[17:49.560 --> 17:55.400]  buds in my hand. I put the camera right against it and focus it in and it will put the trichomes
[17:55.400 --> 17:59.160]  up on the screen. I can see the image up on my computer screen. The trichome heads are this big
[17:59.160 --> 18:03.640]  around. It really helps me out to see colors. You'll learn a lot. You'll be able to identify
[18:03.640 --> 18:07.800]  pests and problems, a lot of different things with that scope. It's really fun to play with.
[18:07.800 --> 18:11.160]  Also just fun to have. You'll be looking at your fingerprints and how much shit's on your hands.
[18:12.120 --> 18:15.720]  Look and see how dirty the computer is. It'll gross you out for a couple of days. It'll be
[18:15.720 --> 18:19.720]  really fun, but get a scope that you can hook up to the computer. Take a couple of shots,
[18:19.720 --> 18:24.200]  shoot me the photos, and then we will be the judge of that. We'll see if your trichomes are done.
[18:24.200 --> 18:28.040]  With your permission, I will put those trichomes up here on the screen. I can screen share them.
[18:28.040 --> 18:32.040]  We'll show the audience. We will get a survey going and see if we think that your plants are
[18:32.040 --> 18:36.600]  as done as we believe they are. If not, what we can do, we can correct your flowering cycle. We
[18:36.600 --> 18:41.000]  can go longer. I'm not just going to say, ha ha, wrong. I'm going to say what we need to do is make
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.120]  adjustments and we'll make adjustments in the right direction. I'd love to see photos. There's
[18:46.120 --> 18:50.360]  another paragraph I've got to skip. Then it says, finally, I just wanted to send my positive
[18:50.360 --> 18:56.840]  vibrations to all of the other blind growers out there. Thanks a lot from Brazil. Big shout out to
[18:56.920 --> 19:01.240]  all the other blind growers out there from our blind grower friend. It's good hearing from you
[19:01.240 --> 19:06.600]  again. I'm really curious about these plants. I don't have a lot of input right now, a lot of
[19:06.600 --> 19:12.120]  feedback. I don't have enough information. I hate to assume that you're cutting too early, but that
[19:12.120 --> 19:18.200]  is my first assumption. Let's see some photos. Let's get some feedback and maybe I can give you
[19:18.200 --> 19:22.200]  more input. All right. How long have we been going? We got plenty of time for another message.
[19:22.200 --> 19:26.760]  Let's jump right into another email. This one is great because it says, what's good, baby?
[19:26.760 --> 19:30.680]  Anybody that starts a message with what's good, baby has got some funny, cool energy. I like that.
[19:30.680 --> 19:35.160]  What's good, baby? It's going to go like this. Yo, Ross to Jeff, what's good, baby? Checking in
[19:35.160 --> 19:41.000]  from Oklahoma, man. Fixing to start up this commercial facility in a small town after the
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.120]  first of the year. I'm currently running your blueberry cookies S1. Shout out. That's also
[19:46.120 --> 19:51.240]  known as Leonardo. It says, I'm running it in my personal garden. I was wondering where the podcast
[19:51.240 --> 19:56.760]  about Leonardo is hidden. If there is even one out yet. I just wanted to give you a holla and say,
[19:56.760 --> 20:01.240]  I appreciate everything you have done and will do for this industry. Thank you. I've got a lot more
[20:01.240 --> 20:06.120]  tricks up my sleeve for this industry. You just fucking wait, bro. COVID's got us kind of slowed
[20:06.120 --> 20:10.200]  down, but you know, can't stop. It won't stop. It goes on to say, it's people like you that really
[20:10.200 --> 20:15.560]  have advanced the cannabis community during its dark days. Thank you. But there are a lot of people
[20:15.560 --> 20:20.760]  that came before me. I am standing on the shoulders of giants. I got a good foundation
[20:20.760 --> 20:24.760]  that I learned from, so I've got to give them a shout out too. But thank you for noticing that
[20:24.760 --> 20:29.880]  I'm trying to carry this cannabis torch as hard as I can, as strongly as I can. It goes on to say,
[20:29.880 --> 20:35.000]  I've been growing now for 19 years. I planted my first seed at the age of 16 and I've said,
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.760]  fuck it ever since. Nice rebellious attitude in this message. It says, I also wanted to show you
[20:40.840 --> 20:47.400]  love for making true S1 form or S1s to work with. Most breeders don't mess with S1s and it's nice to
[20:47.400 --> 20:53.720]  have a grower of your understanding put out quality genetics in true S1 form. S1 form, we've
[20:53.720 --> 20:58.440]  gone over this. That means that I find a quality plant and I simply reverse it and I take pollen
[20:58.440 --> 21:03.480]  from that plant, put that pollen on a clone of the same plant. Then we make seeds that are selfed.
[21:03.480 --> 21:07.640]  It will represent that plant very strongly. And then we put those out for people to grow so they
[21:07.640 --> 21:13.800]  have very quality genetics. It says, don't stop bringing that fire, bro. Trust me, I won't. Then
[21:13.800 --> 21:19.400]  it says from Brody G and you can use my name if this gets that far. What's up Brody? Big shout
[21:19.400 --> 21:24.680]  out. Thank you for sending me the great message. My feedback for Brody goes a lot like this. First
[21:24.680 --> 21:30.600]  of all, thank you, bro. I do appreciate it. Then it says, where am I with this? Strain descriptions.
[21:30.600 --> 21:35.880]  I wrote down the word strain descriptions. There is a podcast for the blueberry cookies S1. It is
[21:35.880 --> 21:43.720]  under a episode called six strain reviews. It's episode number 431 of the grow from your heart
[21:43.720 --> 21:49.800]  podcast. If you go to the grow from your heart podcast on YouTube, there is a list of playlists
[21:49.800 --> 21:56.840]  called strain descriptions. In that list of strain descriptions, there is an episode called strain,
[21:56.840 --> 22:04.280]  six strain reviews, aka TMNT. That is where you will find the blueberry cookies, also known as
[22:04.280 --> 22:10.600]  Leonardo. That is where you will find that podcast. Episode 431 is where to go. I did not
[22:10.600 --> 22:16.840]  talk real in depth about that strain here on this episode. Let's talk briefly about it. Then we will
[22:17.560 --> 22:23.800]  wrap up this one. We're going to say the blueberry cookies S1 is blueberry Tahoe
[22:23.800 --> 22:29.800]  cross to the thin mint cookies. You got that funky Girl Scout cookies aroma. There's something
[22:29.880 --> 22:34.200]  funky. It's got a, and I hate to say what I assume the cross is on there, but it's got a real
[22:34.920 --> 22:39.640]  minty note to it, a pungent note to it. That is to the blueberry Tahoe, which obviously has
[22:39.640 --> 22:47.240]  blueberry notes and gassy notes. The plant grows very well. The blueberry in there corrected the
[22:47.240 --> 22:52.520]  funky growth of the Tahoe. Then it also gave more vigor to that thin mint cookie. It came out really
[22:52.520 --> 22:58.280]  nice. I love the way the plant grows. It gets tall. It gets branchy. For as tall and branchy
[22:58.280 --> 23:02.680]  as it is, it really puts out a lot of harvest and it just fills up the whole plant, fills up with
[23:02.680 --> 23:10.680]  colas. It's got a very, the S1s have a very common and uniform phenotype. Most of them have, it just
[23:10.680 --> 23:14.600]  looks like a mean aggressive plant. It looks like it would kick your ass. The leaves have a nice
[23:14.600 --> 23:20.360]  shape. They're neither Indica nor Sativa looking. They're wider, maple leafy, but then they point in.
[23:20.360 --> 23:25.240]  You could tell that the plant's going to have some potency. They also change shape based on the VPD a
[23:25.240 --> 23:29.320]  little bit. Plants will do that, but they're kind of longer, more aggressive looking than a normal
[23:29.320 --> 23:33.880]  Indica plant. They get tall, but they're real sturdy. They don't need a lot of supports. These
[23:33.880 --> 23:39.160]  plants will hold themselves up most of the time. They make nice colas and giant tops. If you
[23:39.160 --> 23:43.800]  lollipop them and bottom them up a little bit, don't leave a lot of larvae. All of that goes
[23:43.800 --> 23:49.640]  right up to the top. You'll fill in just giant, nice colas. They are resilient. These plants can
[23:49.640 --> 23:56.120]  take abuse and problems. They're stanky. That's my favorite part of the blueberry cookies.
[23:56.120 --> 24:03.560]  They are stanky. They are like raspberry Skittles or blueberry Nerds Ropes. I talk about those
[24:03.560 --> 24:07.480]  blue lollipops I used to eat when I was a kid that would stain my mouth blue. They got gum in the
[24:07.480 --> 24:12.200]  middle. The blue raspberry suckers makes your face all blue. That's why it got called blue raspberry
[24:12.200 --> 24:17.640]  truffle when I crossed it with other stuff. It's got that blue raspberry, kind of a face puckery
[24:17.640 --> 24:25.320]  sort of aroma. It's always real sticky, super photogenic. They also take anything you throw
[24:25.320 --> 24:29.160]  at them. You can abuse this shit out of the blueberry cookies. You can give it too hot. You
[24:29.160 --> 24:34.440]  can give it too cold, too dry, too wet. It just goes, we're going to grow. That's okay. It doesn't
[24:34.440 --> 24:39.880]  really get mad at you. Don't interrupt the light cycle too much. It'll slow down for you,
[24:39.880 --> 24:44.280]  but it won't hurt. It'll just freak out, slow down. I could take feeds. It could take temps.
[24:44.920 --> 24:48.680]  You can overfeed it, underfeed it. You can abuse it. You can knock it over. You can bend it,
[24:48.680 --> 24:53.880]  twist it, crack it, pop it, flip it up, rub it down. Oh no, it'll take all of that shit.
[24:53.880 --> 24:59.560]  It loves abuse. It takes about nine to 10 weeks to flower depending on, it's kind of phenotypically
[24:59.560 --> 25:03.480]  dependent. When you get the S1s, there is a little variation in there. Also, it's going to depend on
[25:03.480 --> 25:08.280]  your room, your lighting, all that stuff. But you got about a nine to 10 week plant. The best part
[25:08.280 --> 25:13.080]  is that no matter how good of a grower you can expect a pretty nice harvest out of it in nine
[25:13.080 --> 25:17.480]  or 10 weeks, it'll be easy to grow. It won't give you too much of a rough time. I recommend
[25:17.480 --> 25:22.360]  doing some defoliation and popping and twisting. It will get kind of tall on you. So if you've got
[25:22.360 --> 25:27.720]  short rooms, flower early. If you want to spread it out, top it one time. It'll make one nice
[25:27.720 --> 25:31.960]  apical dominant top and then it'll start coming up. You can see where that one top, if you cut
[25:31.960 --> 25:36.600]  that one, these other branches will compete and become the secondary main tops. The secondaries
[25:36.600 --> 25:41.400]  will become the main tops. Top it that one time. That'll make a gorgeous plant with a big fat
[25:41.400 --> 25:45.320]  yield for you. If you're going to do them small, do them in a three gallon pot. Don't top them.
[25:45.320 --> 25:49.720]  If you want to go bigger, do them in a seven. Do top them. Have some supports ready because they'll
[25:49.720 --> 25:54.680]  get kind of top heavy toward the end if you top them out. But pretty easy plant to grow. Takes a
[25:54.680 --> 25:59.640]  lot of feedings, takes abuse. It will take anything you throw at it and it will be a winner. So that
[25:59.640 --> 26:04.040]  is the blueberry cookies. If you want a more in-depth review on those strains, again, check
[26:04.120 --> 26:11.160]  out episode number 431. All right. I feel like that covers up my, I called it the blueberry
[26:11.160 --> 26:15.640]  cookies quickie. That's what I called that. So I hope I covered the blueberry cookies quickie
[26:15.640 --> 26:19.400]  real quick there. If you guys have any more questions, I would love to hear from you. The

[27:33.640 --> 27:37.720]  question that just didn't take the time to ask, or they didn't even know they wondered. A lot of
[27:37.720 --> 27:42.120]  the info I give out, people didn't even know they needed to know. You don't know what you don't know.
[27:42.120 --> 27:47.240]  So ask those questions. Don't be shy, you guys. I really enjoy a listener generated content.
