[04:07.790 --> 04:10.830]  It says, thanks from Fat Ankle Foot.
[04:10.830 --> 04:13.370]  The comment was left on February 26th.
[04:13.370 --> 04:16.870]  It says, love to listen, getting better with every episode.
[04:16.870 --> 04:20.630]  As someone whose influence is mainly from Soma's book, it's nice to see things turning
[04:20.630 --> 04:22.150]  to more organic based.
[04:22.150 --> 04:24.110]  Been using worms for years.
[04:24.110 --> 04:27.110]  Please keep doing what you're doing and keep up the great work.
[04:27.110 --> 04:29.910]  Well, thanks a lot for the sweet comment, Fat Ankle Foot.
[04:29.910 --> 04:31.990]  I appreciate that.
[04:31.990 --> 04:37.350]  I'm glad that Soma inspired you and started a lot of your teachings because I was hanging
[04:37.350 --> 04:40.830]  out with a friend who grew weed for several years and we were talking about my crops and
[04:40.830 --> 04:43.670]  he said, dude, you know who you really remind me of is a guy named Soma.
[04:43.670 --> 04:49.270]  At the time, I'd never heard of Soma, so I went home and of course I Googled Soma.
[04:49.270 --> 04:52.590]  Soma and I have a lot of the same philosophies, a lot of the same practices.
[04:52.590 --> 04:53.590]  We agree a lot.
[04:53.590 --> 04:55.510]  I've learned a lot from Soma.
[04:55.510 --> 05:00.150]  I used some of Soma's methods, but mostly his ideals.
[05:00.150 --> 05:03.830]  He almost treats plants as a religion, sort of.
[05:03.830 --> 05:05.070]  His religion is growing pot.
[05:05.070 --> 05:07.390]  I took that spiritual aspect of growing pot.
[05:07.390 --> 05:10.230]  I had that before I ever knew about Soma.
[05:10.230 --> 05:12.990]  I multiplied on it or expanded on it once I found Soma.
[05:12.990 --> 05:14.390]  I'm glad you knew Soma.
[05:14.390 --> 05:16.870]  I'm glad you're a Soma fan.
[05:16.870 --> 05:20.190]  Thanks for using worms in your garden and thanks for trying to go organic and thanks
[05:20.190 --> 05:23.070]  for listening and super thanks for the comment and the five stars.
[05:23.070 --> 05:24.070]  You're part of the crew now.
[05:24.070 --> 05:25.550]  Welcome to the crew, Fat Ankle Foot.
[05:25.550 --> 05:26.550]  We appreciate it.
[05:26.750 --> 05:30.870]  I think I read this comment on the last episode, but this one is from Buzzer.
[05:30.870 --> 05:31.870]  Yeah, I read that.
[05:31.870 --> 05:33.550]  It says, thanks for making this for us.
[05:33.550 --> 05:35.510]  Again, dude, you're super welcome.
[05:35.510 --> 05:37.830]  Thanks for listening.
[05:37.830 --> 05:43.070]  If you guys want to send us a comment, I'd love to read your comments on a future episode.
[05:43.070 --> 05:46.110]  Thanks for the comments for everyone that sent a comment, for the new comments and the
[05:46.110 --> 05:47.110]  old ones.
[05:47.110 --> 05:48.110]  Thanks to everybody.
[05:48.110 --> 05:51.150]  If you want to leave a comment on iTunes or Stitcher or if you don't want to leave a comment
[05:51.150 --> 05:52.750]  on iTunes or Stitcher, just send me a tweet.
[05:52.750 --> 05:53.750]  It's grow from your heart.
[05:53.950 --> 05:57.270]  It's actually at GFYH podcast.
[05:57.270 --> 05:59.870]  Send me a tweet there or find me on Facebook and I'll respond to you.
[05:59.870 --> 06:03.390]  If you want to say something anonymously, you can send me a personal message and I will
[06:03.390 --> 06:05.070]  keep your name private.
[06:05.070 --> 06:08.350]  Just tell me not to say your name and I won't say it on the show or make up a fake name
[06:08.350 --> 06:09.770]  and I'll say that one.
[06:09.770 --> 06:11.470]  You can also send me an email.
[06:11.470 --> 06:13.350]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[06:13.350 --> 06:16.110]  You can let me know if you want your name said or not.
[06:16.110 --> 06:17.110]  I try to be respectful.
[06:17.110 --> 06:18.110]  I know how it is.
[06:18.110 --> 06:21.470]  You can't always tell everybody that you grow cannabis if you don't live in Colorado.
[06:22.470 --> 06:22.970]  All right.
[06:22.970 --> 06:25.070]  That feels like enough intro stuff.
[06:25.070 --> 06:26.670]  I'm going to do a solo episode.
[06:26.670 --> 06:29.670]  I want to talk a little bit about the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[06:29.670 --> 06:33.270]  The Rocky Mountain Worm Company was kind enough to give me a tour of the worm farm.
[06:33.270 --> 06:37.910]  I'm also going to talk a little bit about my company, Iry Genetics, and I'll also talk
[06:37.910 --> 06:40.390]  a little bit about feminized seeds.
[06:40.390 --> 06:43.950]  I've gotten a lot of emails about feminized seeds, so I'll explain my method of making
[06:43.950 --> 06:46.470]  those a little later in the show.
[06:46.470 --> 06:49.190]  Let's start with the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[06:49.190 --> 06:51.390]  Last week, I was invited to go visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[06:51.390 --> 06:55.390]  They gave me a little tour of the building, and I got to see where the worm castings are
[06:55.390 --> 06:56.390]  made.
[06:56.390 --> 07:00.190]  They don't have a giant facility, but what they do have is super clean and super organized,
[07:00.190 --> 07:02.470]  and I was pretty impressed.
[07:02.470 --> 07:06.550]  I got to hang out with Jay and Sean and Alan for a few minutes, and they taught me a lot
[07:06.550 --> 07:11.630]  about worms and worm castings and why they use specific worms that they use to make the
[07:11.630 --> 07:12.630]  worm castings.
[07:12.630 --> 07:17.230]  Some worms, you guys only eat the top layer of if you put them in a big thing of dirt,
[07:17.270 --> 07:20.950]  like if it's a field of dirt or if it's just a bucket full of dirt, they will only eat
[07:20.950 --> 07:23.270]  the top layer and they don't dig down.
[07:23.270 --> 07:26.510]  These guys actually know which worms eat the top, which worms eat the bottom.
[07:26.510 --> 07:29.470]  They know that some worms will eat every layer.
[07:29.470 --> 07:32.830]  Some worms will travel through all of the dirt or whatever you're putting them in, and
[07:32.830 --> 07:36.390]  they will eat and digest all of that.
[07:36.390 --> 07:38.110]  These guys knew a lot about their worms.
[07:38.110 --> 07:42.390]  They showed me worms in every single stage of growth, every single stage of life.
[07:42.390 --> 07:46.370]  They kind of keep the worms in five-gallon buckets, and they let me open the buckets
[07:46.510 --> 07:47.610]  with the worm farms in them.
[07:47.610 --> 07:51.290]  I get to feel the texture of the medium in which the worms live in.
[07:51.290 --> 07:52.690]  It's kind of airy.
[07:52.690 --> 07:53.690]  It's kind of fluffy.
[07:53.690 --> 07:56.530]  It feels a lot like the soil that I mix for my plants.
[07:56.530 --> 07:59.130]  One thing that I thought was really cool is what they're feeding the worms.
[07:59.130 --> 08:02.490]  This is really cool in my opinion.
[08:02.490 --> 08:09.010]  Parts of the worm diet is dried and ground herb from a company called OpenVape.
[08:09.010 --> 08:15.810]  OpenVape makes vapor pen cartridges, so they're extracting the CBD or THC from a plant and
[08:15.810 --> 08:17.570]  making oil out of it.
[08:17.570 --> 08:22.330]  Then they send all the leftover material to the worm company to feed the worms.
[08:22.330 --> 08:27.530]  The worm company is using ground up plant stalks and leaves and whatever else was left
[08:27.530 --> 08:32.730]  for the plants after harvest, after the making oil part happened, and they're feeding the
[08:32.730 --> 08:36.090]  ground up plant matter back to the worms.
[08:36.090 --> 08:40.170]  Then the worms are making castings out of that, and those castings are being used to
[08:40.170 --> 08:45.530]  grow my cannabis and probably those worm castings hopefully make it back to OpenVape and go
[08:45.570 --> 08:47.450]  back into their cannabis.
[08:47.450 --> 08:50.570]  We're kind of doing an in-house recycling sort of thing.
[08:50.570 --> 08:56.050]  It goes full circle without us creating more stuff, without something being tossed into
[08:56.050 --> 08:57.810]  a dumpster for the trash guy to find.
[08:57.810 --> 09:02.690]  Imagine when you harvest, every plant has a stalk and stems and leaves.
[09:02.690 --> 09:07.410]  Imagine if you let that dry, grind it up, and had some worms to feed that to.
[09:07.410 --> 09:10.210]  You wouldn't have to throw all that away and you wouldn't have to make so many trips to
[09:10.210 --> 09:12.650]  the dump or wherever.
[09:12.650 --> 09:13.650]  That's just super efficient.
[09:13.650 --> 09:14.650]  I was completely impressed.
[09:14.770 --> 09:15.770]  Let's see.
[09:15.770 --> 09:21.130]  I want to give a huge shout out to Jay and Sean and Alan and Nick.
[09:21.130 --> 09:23.570]  I really like hanging out with those guys.
[09:23.570 --> 09:25.050]  The Worm Factory is a cool place.
[09:25.050 --> 09:26.690]  I'll definitely be back there soon.
[09:26.690 --> 09:29.650]  Those guys threw a handful of products my way and I'm kind of starting to implement
[09:29.650 --> 09:30.650]  them in my grow.
[09:30.650 --> 09:34.410]  I have to slowly adjust from the organic or from the non-organic bottled stuff to the
[09:34.410 --> 09:37.290]  organics because I don't want to ruin the organic stuff.
[09:37.290 --> 09:39.650]  I'm learning what I can switch out and what I can use together.
[09:39.650 --> 09:43.690]  These guys are definitely, definitely, definitely moving me along quickly.
[09:43.730 --> 09:48.050]  I've been feeding my plants worm castings for about a month now and I can definitely
[09:48.050 --> 09:49.730]  see an improvement in my crops.
[09:49.730 --> 09:54.890]  The first thing I noticed, I would say that after introducing worm castings and GroKoshi,
[09:54.890 --> 09:57.730]  is that my plants are just simply more active.
[09:57.730 --> 09:58.730]  They look more vigorous.
[09:58.730 --> 09:59.730]  They look happier.
[09:59.730 --> 10:00.730]  They're greener.
[10:00.730 --> 10:04.410]  I see more growth and they also seem to want more water, which tells me they're growing
[10:04.410 --> 10:06.730]  and taking nutrients more than before.
[10:06.730 --> 10:12.450]  I definitely encourage the use of GroKoshi and worm castings as a nice way to just start
[10:12.450 --> 10:14.450]  leaning toward the organics.
[10:14.450 --> 10:18.850]  Yeah, so I feel like I've been talking about them for a little bit.
[10:18.850 --> 10:19.850]  Let's see.
[10:19.850 --> 10:24.610]  If you want to learn more about the Worm Company, I definitely recommend you check out their
[10:24.610 --> 10:29.210]  online presence is www.RockyMountainWormCompany.com.
[10:29.210 --> 10:33.050]  They're also on Instagram at Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[10:33.050 --> 10:34.890]  Dude, you will learn a lot from them.
[10:34.890 --> 10:36.610]  If you can stop by their store, check it out.
[10:36.610 --> 10:37.610]  Tell them I sent you.
[10:37.610 --> 10:39.130]  I said that at the beginning, but go there, check it out.
[10:39.130 --> 10:40.130]  It's a great place.
[10:40.330 --> 10:42.770]  So big, huge shout out to the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[10:42.770 --> 10:43.770]  Love you guys.
[10:43.770 --> 10:44.770]  Can't get enough of that place.
[10:44.770 --> 10:47.250]  The other thing I want to talk about is iRegenetics.
[10:47.250 --> 10:51.970]  I get a couple of emails every week about iRegenetics with questions about iRegenetics
[10:51.970 --> 10:52.970]  stuff.
[10:52.970 --> 10:56.730]  And somebody just asked me why I don't talk about iRegenetics on the podcast.
[10:56.730 --> 10:59.890]  The show isn't really about iRegenetics.
[10:59.890 --> 11:01.650]  The show is about cannabis in general.
[11:01.650 --> 11:05.970]  So I try not to focus too much on my own company, but it seems like you guys are interested.
[11:05.970 --> 11:08.570]  So I guess it seems fair that I talk about it a little bit.
[11:08.570 --> 11:09.570]  I try not to toot my own horn.
[11:10.010 --> 11:11.010]  I'm going to take a sip here.
[11:11.010 --> 11:13.860]  Sorry, hold on.
[11:13.860 --> 11:14.860]  All right.
[11:14.860 --> 11:17.180]  So let's talk about iRegenetics, I guess.
[11:17.180 --> 11:18.180]  Let's jump into this.
[11:18.180 --> 11:22.740]  iRegenetics is, of course, my seed company.
[11:22.740 --> 11:25.660]  I breed regular and feminized cannabis seeds.
[11:25.660 --> 11:29.100]  Right now, iRegenetics is pretty much sold out of seeds for the most part.
[11:29.100 --> 11:33.820]  Nature's Green Remedies is my main distributor, and they got most of what I had left over
[11:33.820 --> 11:36.660]  after I hooked up most of my local friends with my latest harvest.
[11:37.020 --> 11:41.140]  I really like to get the locals, all my friends, all my...
[11:41.140 --> 11:42.140]  Colorado.
[11:42.140 --> 11:44.540]  I mean, my company is called iRegenetics Colorado.
[11:44.540 --> 11:47.580]  Colorado is what allowed me to become this breeder.
[11:47.580 --> 11:51.780]  I feel like the local people should get the iRegenetics products first.
[11:51.780 --> 11:54.700]  And that way I get to see what they grow and I get to take pictures of it.
[11:54.700 --> 11:56.500]  I can take clones of it.
[11:56.500 --> 12:00.300]  So I'm not trying to be rude about it, but the locals always get served up first.
[12:00.300 --> 12:04.260]  After I feel like everybody's gotten their seeds, make sure Nature's Green Remedies gets
[12:04.260 --> 12:06.340]  what they can do.
[12:07.020 --> 12:10.540]  I really can't make enough seeds to meet the demand lately, honestly.
[12:10.540 --> 12:14.020]  I'm going to make more Golden Goat and Lemon Jeffery seeds here really soon.
[12:14.020 --> 12:16.700]  The boys for that project are actually in flower.
[12:16.700 --> 12:20.340]  When you make fem seeds or seeds in general, you got to start the boys off a little bit
[12:20.340 --> 12:21.740]  ahead of the females.
[12:21.740 --> 12:22.980]  So the males are in flower now.
[12:22.980 --> 12:25.660]  The girls will go on flower in a couple of few days.
[12:25.660 --> 12:28.780]  Those should be ready in about 90 days from now.
[12:28.780 --> 12:31.140]  I think this episode will come out March 1st or 2nd.
[12:31.300 --> 12:38.220]  And 90 days from then, I should have Lemon Jeffery and Golden Goat seeds available.
[12:38.220 --> 12:41.060]  I actually wrote down the wrong strain and I almost said the wrong strain and teased
[12:41.060 --> 12:42.060]  you guys.
[12:42.060 --> 12:44.900]  But yes, I'm making more Lemon Jeffery and I'm making more Golden Goat right now.
[12:44.900 --> 12:46.860]  They should be ready in about 90 days.
[12:46.860 --> 12:48.300]  The locals will get them first.
[12:48.300 --> 12:49.420]  There is no waiting list.
[12:49.420 --> 12:52.060]  There's not a way to get on a waiting list right now.
[12:52.060 --> 12:55.860]  After my locals get served up, they will be dished out to Nature's Green Remedies and
[12:55.860 --> 12:58.700]  naturesgreenremedies.com will sell out quickly.
[12:58.700 --> 12:59.700]  I promise you.
[12:59.700 --> 13:02.220]  I'll make an announcement on this show before they go there.
[13:02.220 --> 13:05.780]  So when I make those Lemon Jeffery and the Golden Goats, I'm also going to put a new
[13:05.780 --> 13:08.300]  cut called Kalonji Kush in there.
[13:08.300 --> 13:13.060]  Kalonji Kush is the grateful dog pollinated the Tahoe OG.
[13:13.060 --> 13:16.300]  And I call it Kalonji Kush after a reggae artist named Sizzla Kalonji.
[13:16.300 --> 13:20.900]  If you're wondering where my weird names come from, Kalonji is a reggae artist, Sizzla Kalonji.
[13:20.900 --> 13:24.600]  So I'm going to cross the Golden Goat to the Sizzla Kalonji.
[13:24.600 --> 13:29.500]  And I want to call that Sunshine Girl, which is actually a Sizzla song.
[13:29.500 --> 13:30.900]  So I think that's going to be pretty cute.
[13:30.900 --> 13:33.540]  I have a couple more ideas that I'm going to put in that room.
[13:33.540 --> 13:36.740]  I have two more females that are going in there for sure, but I don't want to talk too
[13:36.740 --> 13:40.700]  much about them until I've got some seeds in my hands from those.
[13:40.700 --> 13:44.100]  Because, man, let me tell you a weird side story.
[13:44.100 --> 13:47.300]  One time I reversed a Golden Goat plant, a female Golden Goat plant.
[13:47.300 --> 13:48.300]  I treated it.
[13:48.300 --> 13:49.540]  I turned it into a male.
[13:49.540 --> 13:51.660]  And I'll talk more about that later in the show, how I do that.
[13:51.660 --> 13:54.020]  But I turned this female plant into a male, right?
[13:54.020 --> 13:55.680]  And it created pollen.
[13:55.680 --> 13:58.180]  And I put that pollen on a room full of plants.
[13:58.180 --> 14:00.260]  And that's how I created the Lemon Jeffrey.
[14:00.260 --> 14:02.180]  That's how I made Golden Goat seeds.
[14:02.180 --> 14:05.220]  There was another cross in the room that's never been released or shown to anybody because
[14:05.220 --> 14:07.500]  it only made a few seeds and those are mine.
[14:07.500 --> 14:11.820]  But I also sprinkled that pollen on another plant.
[14:11.820 --> 14:12.820]  The strain was headband.
[14:12.820 --> 14:16.700]  It was a headband cut that I got from my good buddy, Hanky B. He gave me that headband cut.
[14:16.700 --> 14:18.700]  I sprinkled pollen on it.
[14:18.700 --> 14:21.500]  And when that plant took the pollen, the plant died.
[14:21.500 --> 14:24.540]  Within 24 hours, that plant was dead.
[14:24.540 --> 14:26.300]  Every other plant in the room was healthy and happy.
[14:26.300 --> 14:27.300]  It took the pollen.
[14:27.300 --> 14:29.900]  It showed signs of being pollinated just like it should have.
[14:29.900 --> 14:31.560]  I don't know what went wrong.
[14:31.560 --> 14:36.140]  But that headband plant died within 24 hours of taking feminized pollen.
[14:36.140 --> 14:37.620]  I've never seen that from a plant.
[14:37.620 --> 14:39.060]  I've never heard of that from a plant.
[14:39.060 --> 14:40.580]  I've talked to other breeders.
[14:40.580 --> 14:42.020]  Nobody has an explanation for that.
[14:42.020 --> 14:43.100]  The plant was healthy.
[14:43.100 --> 14:44.100]  Everything was cool.
[14:44.100 --> 14:45.100]  I don't know what the hell happened.
[14:45.100 --> 14:48.220]  So I'm going to put another headband in there and I'm going to hit it with Golden Goat pollen
[14:48.220 --> 14:49.220]  again.
[14:49.220 --> 14:52.260]  And I've got a name for it, but I'm hesitant to say it on the show because people are going
[14:52.260 --> 14:53.580]  to rip me off.
[14:53.580 --> 14:55.540]  But if I say it, then no one can steal it from me, right?
[14:55.540 --> 14:56.540]  Because I'm saying it.
[14:56.540 --> 15:01.620]  The Golden Goat is going to pollinate the headband plant and I will call it the Halo.
[15:01.620 --> 15:04.700]  You see, you got a headband and now it's gold.
[15:04.700 --> 15:05.700]  It's above your head.
[15:05.700 --> 15:06.700]  That's the Halo, bro.
[15:06.700 --> 15:07.700]  So that's what I think.
[15:07.700 --> 15:10.380]  I'm going to call the headband to the Golden Goat, the Halo.
[15:10.380 --> 15:14.180]  And the Kalonji Kush to the Golden Goat will be the Sunshine Girl.
[15:14.180 --> 15:15.660]  Those are coming up, you guys, about 90 days.
[15:15.660 --> 15:16.660]  So pay attention.
[15:16.660 --> 15:19.420]  I'll need some testers, but I didn't say that on the show.
[15:19.420 --> 15:20.420]  Let's see more about iRegenetics.
[15:20.420 --> 15:25.420]  I recently started my work on making Black Cherry Chem F2 seeds.
[15:25.420 --> 15:27.540]  F2 is finial generation.
[15:27.540 --> 15:28.860]  So I made the F1s, right?
[15:28.860 --> 15:32.540]  That's plush berry was pollinated by a Daybreaker plant.
[15:32.540 --> 15:36.500]  And the seeds that came out of there were called F1, the first finial generation of
[15:36.500 --> 15:37.700]  that cross.
[15:37.700 --> 15:42.360]  So now I grew a bunch of them out and I found the male that I want.
[15:42.360 --> 15:46.340]  And I've recently found three females that are good candidates for breeding.
[15:46.340 --> 15:49.540]  So I'm waiting for these plants to finish before I commit to which females I'm going
[15:49.660 --> 15:51.660]  to use to continue the line into F2.
[15:51.660 --> 15:55.980]  But once I choose one, I'm going to choose two of them actually.
[15:55.980 --> 15:58.660]  And I'm going to hit both of them with the male pollen.
[15:58.660 --> 16:04.300]  And then I will keep all of the seeds separate so that it's phenotype number seven and eight
[16:04.300 --> 16:06.620]  are the two that I'm really eyeballing for my females.
[16:06.620 --> 16:09.900]  So I'll keep Black Cherry Chem seven and Black Cherry Chem eight separate and pull all the
[16:09.900 --> 16:10.900]  seeds out.
[16:10.900 --> 16:15.100]  And I'll grow a hundred of each one of those and see which one shows me what I like.
[16:15.100 --> 16:17.820]  And I will keep that one to continue working with.
[16:17.820 --> 16:19.460]  So I'm waiting for these plants to finish.
[16:19.500 --> 16:20.500]  I got to smoke them.
[16:20.500 --> 16:21.500]  I got to dry them.
[16:21.500 --> 16:22.500]  I got to turn some of it into dabs.
[16:22.500 --> 16:23.500]  I got to smoke some of it as flower.
[16:23.500 --> 16:25.820]  I got to see which one I really like the best.
[16:25.820 --> 16:29.380]  And then that will be used to make the F3.
[16:29.380 --> 16:33.020]  And I'm really trying to stabilize the purple tree in that strain is what I'm trying to
[16:33.020 --> 16:34.020]  do.
[16:34.020 --> 16:39.460]  So I really want, right now I'm getting about a little more than 50% purple.
[16:39.460 --> 16:43.140]  When I run a pack of 50, I'll have 25 purple plants.
[16:43.140 --> 16:45.900]  I want to make it up to closer.
[16:45.900 --> 16:48.940]  I want to get like 75% purple plants out of this.
[16:49.420 --> 16:52.780]  And then by the time I'm done, I'd like to see that purple plant come out almost every
[16:52.780 --> 16:54.420]  time is what I'm aiming for.
[16:54.420 --> 16:58.140]  I plan to take it to F5 over the next few years.
[16:58.140 --> 17:00.580]  I'll breed the F2s this summer.
[17:00.580 --> 17:03.740]  One thing I've seen out of it that's really cool is some of the phenotypes look done and
[17:03.740 --> 17:06.380]  they're only 55 days into flower.
[17:06.380 --> 17:12.420]  So I've made a purple strain with a chem flavor that finishes in about 55 to 65 days, which
[17:12.420 --> 17:14.140]  is pretty cool.
[17:14.140 --> 17:17.140]  So that's my Black Cherry Chem project that's going right now.
[17:17.140 --> 17:18.220]  You can check out pictures of those.
[17:18.500 --> 17:23.260]  I put them on Instagram and I also put them on my forum on my website.
[17:23.260 --> 17:26.740]  If you go to iRegeneticsColorado.com, go to the forum.
[17:26.740 --> 17:30.180]  It would be really cool if you join the forum, sign up and join the forum.
[17:30.180 --> 17:31.180]  It doesn't cost anything.
[17:31.180 --> 17:32.340]  Nothing weird is going to happen.
[17:32.340 --> 17:35.540]  You're just a member now and you can communicate with us and participate.
[17:35.540 --> 17:39.580]  But every week I go and post a weekly grow journal of my own gardens up there.
[17:39.580 --> 17:41.860]  And the Black Cherry Chem has been highlighted quite a bit.
[17:41.860 --> 17:45.580]  So you can see a lot of great pictures of Black Cherry Chem on my website right now
[17:45.580 --> 17:46.580]  in the forum.
[17:46.980 --> 17:48.740]  Go there and check it out if you can.
[17:48.740 --> 17:53.140]  And if you ask me questions there and you talk to me, that's my favorite place to go
[17:53.140 --> 17:56.140]  and communicate with people because they can't censor me because I own that.
[17:56.140 --> 17:58.220]  Facebook can't shut that down or anything.
[17:58.220 --> 17:59.580]  So do what you want to do there.
[17:59.580 --> 18:02.700]  If I think you're a dick, I might tell you to quit being a dick, but man, grow weed and
[18:02.700 --> 18:03.700]  post your weed pictures there.
[18:03.700 --> 18:04.700]  I'd love it.
[18:04.700 --> 18:07.020]  All right.
[18:07.020 --> 18:11.100]  One thing I can talk about is I'm looking for an Arise male.
[18:11.100 --> 18:16.540]  Arise is a golden goat that was pollinated by Daybreaker and I really love that strain.
[18:17.500 --> 18:18.500]  It makes a great smell.
[18:18.500 --> 18:20.420]  It makes great flavor.
[18:20.420 --> 18:21.580]  The high is amazing.
[18:21.580 --> 18:23.460]  The plants put on super resin.
[18:23.460 --> 18:26.100]  They grow in a good amount of time.
[18:26.100 --> 18:27.340]  They're real stout plants.
[18:27.340 --> 18:30.620]  You don't need a lot of staking on it if you find the right phenotypes.
[18:30.620 --> 18:31.620]  So I'm looking for an Arise male.
[18:31.620 --> 18:34.340]  I want to use Arise in a long-term breeding project.
[18:34.340 --> 18:37.860]  He will be my long-term breeding male.
[18:37.860 --> 18:41.980]  I see some beautiful things from the strain and I'm sure that a good male will make some
[18:41.980 --> 18:43.420]  more amazing crosses.
[18:43.420 --> 18:45.620]  The resin production from that plant is so impressive.
[18:45.700 --> 18:48.780]  But it'll be a few months before I select an Arise male.
[18:48.780 --> 18:52.900]  I've got the Feminize Golden Goat Lemon Jeffery project ahead of that.
[18:52.900 --> 18:56.060]  I've got the Black Cherry Kim ahead of that.
[18:56.060 --> 18:59.260]  And then after that will be the Arise male selection.
[18:59.260 --> 19:06.060]  I want to find a good Arise male for my permanent breeding stud, but I plan to make like 15 to
[19:06.060 --> 19:09.780]  20 F1 hybrids with Arise to see what works when I do find that one.
[19:09.780 --> 19:13.580]  Then I want to see what can be improved on or what I need to abandon.
[19:14.580 --> 19:19.020]  Guys, if you breed, if you take a male plant and you hit six or seven female plants with
[19:19.020 --> 19:23.500]  it, don't be afraid to throw away a bunch of seeds.
[19:23.500 --> 19:24.500]  You have to grow those.
[19:24.500 --> 19:29.140]  So you take a male plant in a room with however many females you're going to put in there,
[19:29.140 --> 19:30.980]  five, six, maybe 20 females.
[19:30.980 --> 19:33.180]  You're going to make that many new crosses.
[19:33.180 --> 19:38.340]  You have to grow some of each batch of seeds yourself before you can do anything else with
[19:38.340 --> 19:41.740]  them, unless you give them to your friend and you say, these are untested, dude, because
[19:41.780 --> 19:45.700]  you don't want to put out seeds that you don't know what they're going to do.
[19:45.700 --> 19:50.260]  So get the seeds and grow at least 10, I would say 100 if you can.
[19:50.260 --> 19:52.100]  I know you're limited on space and things.
[19:52.100 --> 19:53.860]  I like a pheno hunt of 100 plants.
[19:53.860 --> 19:58.300]  It really shows you what's going to happen, but grow some of those.
[19:58.300 --> 20:00.740]  And if they totally suck, throw them away.
[20:00.740 --> 20:04.700]  I know that sounds crazy, but there are enough strains on the planet to where if you just
[20:04.700 --> 20:09.200]  made some bullshit that doesn't improve the genetic line, throw it away.
[20:09.200 --> 20:10.600]  Why do we need that?
[20:10.600 --> 20:13.960]  Don't be so attached to your new creation that, oh, it's a great strain.
[20:13.960 --> 20:14.960]  It does this.
[20:14.960 --> 20:15.960]  No, it sucks.
[20:15.960 --> 20:16.960]  Throw it away.
[20:16.960 --> 20:20.600]  I've thrown away more strains than I have kept.
[20:20.600 --> 20:22.240]  We all talk about the lemon cush.
[20:22.240 --> 20:25.420]  Everybody had high hopes for the lemon cush that I worked with.
[20:25.420 --> 20:26.720]  That strain sucked.
[20:26.720 --> 20:31.440]  It tasted amazing and it grew big, fat donkey dicks for buds, but you couldn't get high
[20:31.440 --> 20:32.440]  off of it.
[20:32.440 --> 20:33.440]  It would not make resin.
[20:33.440 --> 20:36.120]  None of the phenotypes on that plant made resin, and I don't know why.
[20:36.120 --> 20:38.320]  It was just that cross did not work.
[20:38.800 --> 20:39.920]  All of the seeds are gone.
[20:39.920 --> 20:40.960]  All of the clones are gone.
[20:40.960 --> 20:42.480]  That project has been abandoned.
[20:42.480 --> 20:44.040]  I realize that's a failed project.
[20:44.040 --> 20:48.600]  It wasted some time, but I don't want to waste more time or more people's time with the same
[20:48.600 --> 20:52.760]  project by sending out shitty seeds.
[20:52.760 --> 20:55.800]  That's a rant on not being too attachment.
[20:55.800 --> 20:56.800]  That's a lesson in attachment.
[20:56.800 --> 20:59.640]  If you're too attached to that strain, then you're wasting your time growing something
[20:59.640 --> 21:01.480]  that sucks and you could have been growing something way better.
[21:01.480 --> 21:03.560]  You could have been breeding something that was way better.
[21:03.560 --> 21:04.560]  Just let it go.
[21:04.560 --> 21:05.560]  Sometimes you got to learn to let things go.
[21:05.560 --> 21:07.760]  Remember that lesson I talked about my rig that I dropped?
[21:08.200 --> 21:11.120]  You just got to sweep it up and move on sometimes.
[21:11.120 --> 21:15.600]  When I do get all these new strains made, I will need help testing these.
[21:15.600 --> 21:22.160]  Like I said, I like to run 100 myself, but I will also send out a bunch of seeds to reliable
[21:22.160 --> 21:23.160]  testers.
[21:23.160 --> 21:26.440]  The way that I know you're a reliable tester is you've joined my web forum and you have
[21:26.440 --> 21:30.680]  posted pictures of your previous grows on my forum and you stay in contact with me and
[21:30.680 --> 21:32.620]  you show that you're serious about it.
[21:32.620 --> 21:36.440]  That's a lot of how I find my testers is off of my own website.
[21:36.440 --> 21:39.920]  In the future, if you're interested in testing iRegenetics seeds, it would help you a lot
[21:39.920 --> 21:41.640]  to join the forum.
[21:41.640 --> 21:43.200]  I do play favorites that way.
[21:43.200 --> 21:44.200]  It's my choice.
[21:44.200 --> 21:45.200]  All right.
[21:45.200 --> 21:46.200]  Let's see.
[21:46.200 --> 21:48.280]  I'm not sure what else to say about iRegenetics.
[21:48.280 --> 21:49.800]  I'm the head breeder.
[21:49.800 --> 21:53.120]  I make 99% of the decisions with help from my friends.
[21:53.120 --> 21:57.320]  I do let the people around me kind of give their input because they're cannabis consumers,
[21:57.320 --> 21:58.320]  growers, smokers.
[21:58.320 --> 22:00.160]  They have a lot to say, but that's me.
[22:00.160 --> 22:02.600]  iRegenetics is all Rasta Jeff.
[22:02.600 --> 22:03.880]  I have trim friends that help me.
[22:03.880 --> 22:07.680]  Shout out to everybody that's ever came and helped me trim some iRegenetics stuff or shout
[22:07.680 --> 22:11.000]  out to all the people that have helped me package seeds or whatever.
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.760]  In the future, I am going to get away from the feminized seed market as much because
[22:15.760 --> 22:19.040]  feminized seeds are a pain in the ass to make.
[22:19.040 --> 22:24.000]  I think that we should all eventually step up our game and learn to just grow regular
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  seeds.
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.400]  If we didn't have male plants, we wouldn't have more plants anyway.
[22:29.400 --> 22:34.840]  It's my responsibility to put out more regular seeds, I think, than I do feminized seeds.
[22:34.840 --> 22:41.360]  I see better shit come from the regular crosses than I do the fem seeds, honestly.
[22:41.360 --> 22:42.360]  Feminized seeds are stuck.
[22:42.360 --> 22:44.120]  You can't improve on them too much.
[22:44.120 --> 22:47.400]  The cross that you make, that's what you got.
[22:47.400 --> 22:51.840]  I see when I cross, if it's feminized, if I cross plant A and plant B, they come out
[22:51.840 --> 22:55.580]  a little bit better than A and B were, but you can't make them super better.
[22:55.580 --> 23:00.980]  If I take a regular male plant and a female plant and cross that, I see much better stuff
[23:00.980 --> 23:05.420]  come out of that, much more improved plants, transgressive segregation.
[23:05.420 --> 23:09.380]  My offspring will outperform each parent.
[23:09.380 --> 23:11.180]  That only happens when I'm using regular pollen.
[23:11.180 --> 23:15.060]  I can't make that happen with my feminized pollen.
[23:15.060 --> 23:19.500]  There are a couple of reasons why I will eventually abandon the feminized seeds.
[23:19.500 --> 23:24.940]  That's eventually, I'm not saying soon, but one of these days I will stop making fem seeds.
[23:24.980 --> 23:27.260]  I don't know what else to say about Irie Genetics.
[23:27.260 --> 23:30.540]  There's so much I could say, but I feel like I'm just stroking my own ego over here talking
[23:30.540 --> 23:32.740]  about Irie a lot.
[23:32.740 --> 23:33.860]  Support Irie Genetics, dude.
[23:33.860 --> 23:37.700]  It's a Rastafarian seed company by a Rasta man.
[23:37.700 --> 23:40.960]  Instead of having mass produced commercial seeds, you've got seeds.
[23:40.960 --> 23:42.540]  Every seed was touched by me.
[23:42.540 --> 23:46.340]  Every plant was touched by me, by my Rastafarian hands.
[23:46.340 --> 23:48.140]  It's got a little bit of Rasta love in there.
[23:48.140 --> 23:49.380]  I think that means something to me.
[23:49.380 --> 23:54.780]  I'd rather buy products from a small company that cares about their products than the Walmart
[23:54.780 --> 23:57.540]  of whatever industry you're in.
[23:57.540 --> 23:59.500]  Let's get onto another topic here.
[23:59.500 --> 24:03.860]  I mentioned that I wanted to talk about feminized seeds a little bit.
[24:03.860 --> 24:08.420]  A lot of people seem to have misconceptions on what feminized seeds are, on how they're
[24:08.420 --> 24:11.940]  made, on where they come from, and on what they will do.
[24:11.940 --> 24:16.740]  People think that feminized seeds are straight up hermaphrodite seeds, which I've got a pretty
[24:16.740 --> 24:20.660]  popular seed company that only sold feminized seeds for two years.
[24:20.660 --> 24:24.300]  We came up pretty good, and I don't know how Irie Genetics would be popular and or
[24:24.300 --> 24:27.860]  reliable if we just sold a bunch of damn herms.
[24:27.860 --> 24:28.860]  Let's start with some basics here.
[24:28.860 --> 24:30.420]  What does it mean to have feminized seeds?
[24:30.420 --> 24:33.260]  I took a few random notes.
[24:33.260 --> 24:36.100]  Feminized seeds mean that the seeds will produce all female plants.
[24:36.100 --> 24:41.700]  I can only say 99% female plants because this is science and nature and shit happens, but
[24:41.700 --> 24:43.980]  there'll be 99% females.
[24:43.980 --> 24:47.340]  This is helpful because new growers don't know how to identify male plants in their
[24:47.340 --> 24:48.340]  gardens.
[24:48.580 --> 24:51.820]  If you're growing feminized seeds, you don't have to watch for the boys.
[24:51.820 --> 24:56.200]  It also makes things easier for growers with limited space because the grower knows that
[24:56.200 --> 25:01.060]  every seed planted will be a usable female and none of their space, soil, nutrients,
[25:01.060 --> 25:04.820]  water, electricity, none of that's going to be wasted on growing a male plant that had
[25:04.820 --> 25:07.300]  to be chopped down 10 days into flower.
[25:07.300 --> 25:10.980]  Feminized seeds mean that all of the seeds will produce female plants.
[25:10.980 --> 25:13.980]  Now, here is where some people are confused.
[25:13.980 --> 25:16.380]  How are feminized seeds made?
[25:16.420 --> 25:21.060]  Pay close attention because honestly, you guys, I'm amazed with myself that I'm giving
[25:21.060 --> 25:22.060]  out this information.
[25:22.060 --> 25:24.620]  This is one of my biggest secrets that I don't usually share with anyone.
[25:24.620 --> 25:29.100]  I'm going to take a dab and a drink before I share this, but I'm going to take a quick
[25:29.100 --> 25:34.760]  dab and a quick drink and then I will teach you guys how I make reliable feminized seeds
[25:34.760 --> 25:41.020]  on a semi-large scale for Nature's Green Remedies and patients throughout Colorado.
[25:41.020 --> 25:42.020]  Give me a quick second.
[25:42.020 --> 25:43.020]  I'm going to take a dab and a drink.
[25:43.020 --> 25:44.020]  All right, guys.
[25:44.020 --> 25:46.980]  I am back and heavily medicated after that dab.
[25:46.980 --> 25:49.940]  I wanted to tell you how I make my feminized seeds.
[25:49.940 --> 25:54.100]  First of all, I got to warn you that the chemicals that I will describe here are a little bit
[25:54.100 --> 25:57.020]  dangerous and you need to follow the safety rules for these.
[25:57.020 --> 26:01.140]  I am not responsible for you hurting yourself or making yourself sick with these chemicals,
[26:01.140 --> 26:02.140]  okay?
[26:02.140 --> 26:03.480]  I'm simply telling you how I do this.
[26:03.480 --> 26:09.140]  If you do this, follow the instructions, wear gloves, wear goggles, do everything safely.
[26:09.260 --> 26:14.460]  The way I start is I order silver nitrate and sodium thiosulfate from a scientific supply
[26:14.460 --> 26:16.780]  company.
[26:16.780 --> 26:23.820]  I get powdered versions of silver nitrate and sodium thiosulfate and I mix...
[26:23.820 --> 26:29.020]  I'm not even going to tell you the dilutions or the rates, but I mix the silver nitrate
[26:29.020 --> 26:35.200]  into an amount of water and I mix an amount of the thiosulfate into an amount of water
[26:35.320 --> 26:40.200]  and then I mix those two in another container, into another container.
[26:40.200 --> 26:46.000]  Now I've got 100% silver thiosulfate in that third container and I will dilute that to
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.920]  a certain dilution.
[26:47.920 --> 26:53.800]  Now, some plants will need stronger dilutions of the silver thiosulfate and some plants
[26:53.800 --> 26:57.400]  will need lighter dilutions of the silver thiosulfate.
[26:57.400 --> 27:05.480]  What I've learned is some plants I can treat, some plants one time with the silver thiosulfate
[27:05.480 --> 27:10.320]  at a high dilution just before flower, the day before flower, and that will work for
[27:10.320 --> 27:11.320]  that plant.
[27:11.320 --> 27:16.160]  Some of them I have to make the dilution much weaker and spray it multiple times and some
[27:16.160 --> 27:19.560]  plants I have to make it stronger and only spray it once.
[27:19.560 --> 27:24.200]  The only way you'll learn this is through experimentation, by trying plants, by trying
[27:24.200 --> 27:25.200]  different dilutions.
[27:25.560 --> 27:31.160]  So I put the silver nitrate into one container of water, I put the thiosulfate into another
[27:31.160 --> 27:35.560]  container of water, I shake them up to where it dissolves, I mix equal amounts into another
[27:35.560 --> 27:39.800]  container and then I take that container and dilute it to the proper dilution for the plant
[27:39.800 --> 27:40.800]  that I'm working with.
[27:40.800 --> 27:45.720]  Then I will, I'm going to use golden goat because I just did this to golden goat about
[27:45.720 --> 27:46.720]  seven days ago.
[27:46.720 --> 27:50.280]  I took three golden goat plants and I put them in a small space where there aren't any
[27:50.280 --> 27:51.440]  other plants around.
[27:51.440 --> 27:56.880]  There's no wind to where my spray is not going to randomly land on other plants because I
[27:56.880 --> 28:00.180]  don't want to reverse other plants on accident in this process.
[28:00.180 --> 28:04.720]  So I took my three golden goat plants, I put them in a small confined space and I sprayed
[28:04.720 --> 28:10.440]  them with my silver thiosulfate mix at the proper dilution and I sprayed these plants
[28:10.440 --> 28:13.680]  to the point where they are dripping from top to bottom.
[28:13.680 --> 28:17.160]  These plants were covered in this silver thiosulfate solution.
[28:17.160 --> 28:21.520]  Be careful because if you use the silver thiosulfate at a strong dilution, it may turn
[28:21.520 --> 28:26.040]  things purple, like the floor where the spray lands on the wall behind it, it may leave
[28:26.040 --> 28:27.460]  little purple marks.
[28:27.460 --> 28:31.880]  So be careful or a little shiny purple mark, like shiny iridescent looking marks, I think
[28:31.880 --> 28:32.880]  is the word.
[28:32.880 --> 28:34.800]  It's kind of neat the way it looks, but it'll screw some stuff up if you don't want your
[28:34.800 --> 28:35.800]  things purple.
[28:35.800 --> 28:36.800]  Be careful.
[28:36.800 --> 28:38.960]  So spray the plants.
[28:38.960 --> 28:42.600]  Then I let them sit and dry because I want them dry before they go in a flower room.
[28:42.600 --> 28:44.680]  So I let the plants dry.
[28:44.680 --> 28:49.360]  Then I carry those plants to the flower room where they will go into flower and I try to
[28:49.360 --> 28:52.800]  spray them right before the lights off for the flowering cycle.
[28:52.800 --> 28:55.960]  So they get sprayed, they dry, and then they go into the flower room and the lights go
[28:55.960 --> 28:58.880]  off and they have now just gone into flower.
[28:58.880 --> 29:05.960]  And with the golden goat, I can spray it one time the day of flower and in about 10 days,
[29:05.960 --> 29:08.720]  that plant will show me male flowers.
[29:08.720 --> 29:13.720]  Now, people are saying, how does that work?
[29:13.760 --> 29:15.520]  I got to explain this to you kind of slowly.
[29:15.520 --> 29:17.960]  So pay attention because I'm trying to explain it to myself.
[29:17.960 --> 29:19.000]  I don't have any notes on this.
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.040]  I'm just freestyling right now.
[29:20.040 --> 29:21.040]  So bear with me.
[29:21.040 --> 29:28.280]  What happens is when we spray a female plant with silver thiosulfate solution, the thiosulfate
[29:28.280 --> 29:30.320]  acts as a carrier for the silver.
[29:30.320 --> 29:35.280]  The silver isn't really absorbed by the leaves easily, but the thiosulfate makes it get in
[29:35.280 --> 29:36.840]  there a little bit better.
[29:36.840 --> 29:41.240]  So we're tricking the plants into taking the silver by absorbing the thiosulfate.
[29:41.240 --> 29:46.480]  Now when the silver reaches the plants, the silver disrupts the copper movement in the
[29:46.480 --> 29:47.480]  plant system.
[29:47.480 --> 29:48.720]  There is copper in your plants.
[29:48.720 --> 29:49.720]  Yes.
[29:49.720 --> 29:51.800]  The silver will disrupt that.
[29:51.800 --> 29:56.120]  When that copper movement is disrupted in the plant system, it responds by triggering
[29:56.120 --> 29:57.120]  an ethylene production.
[29:57.120 --> 29:59.000]  Or I'm sorry, an ethylene.
[29:59.000 --> 30:00.360]  It triggers an ethylene response.
[30:00.360 --> 30:01.400]  It's not an ethylene production.
[30:01.400 --> 30:03.080]  It's an ethylene response.
[30:03.080 --> 30:08.000]  And that ethylene response tells the plant that something is seriously wrong and it's
[30:08.000 --> 30:09.960]  time to go into survival mode.
[30:09.960 --> 30:14.920]  So that plant survival method is to create male flowers that will create pollen because
[30:14.920 --> 30:20.400]  now all that plant wants to do is shoot pollen and reproduce to keep the species alive.
[30:20.400 --> 30:21.680]  So I've disrupted the copper.
[30:21.680 --> 30:23.120]  The plant's freaking out.
[30:23.120 --> 30:24.120]  It panics.
[30:24.120 --> 30:27.560]  The panic causes ethylene to move through the plant in a weird way.
[30:27.560 --> 30:32.160]  That ethylene triggers the plant to throw out flowers that are male flowers that produce
[30:32.160 --> 30:33.160]  pollen.
[30:33.160 --> 30:39.480]  Now, since those plants, that female plant is all female, it does not have any male chromosomes.
[30:40.000 --> 30:43.800]  The only reason it is showing male sex parts is because I've stressed it and manipulated
[30:43.800 --> 30:45.560]  it.
[30:45.560 --> 30:50.880]  So it will now throw out male parts that contain pollen and that pollen will be all female.
[30:50.880 --> 30:53.920]  Excuse me, my throat's clogging up here from the dabs.
[30:53.920 --> 30:55.680]  Let me take another drink of water.
[30:55.680 --> 30:58.160]  All right, that should help.
[30:58.160 --> 31:03.000]  So now we've got female plants that are spitting out all female pollen and we're taking that
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.480]  pollen and of course putting it on female plants.
[31:06.480 --> 31:08.960]  We've never introduced any male pollen here.
[31:09.960 --> 31:13.840]  Like I said before, 99% of those plants should come out female.
[31:13.840 --> 31:17.960]  The only reason I can say 99% is because like I said, it's science and nature and shit does
[31:17.960 --> 31:18.960]  happen.
[31:18.960 --> 31:21.720]  Also, your grow room can cause issues as well.
[31:21.720 --> 31:22.720]  Your grow style can.
[31:22.720 --> 31:23.720]  I'm not blaming it on you.
[31:23.720 --> 31:28.200]  I'm just saying that environmental factors and all that stuff plus science and nature
[31:28.200 --> 31:30.720]  will lead to some screw ups.
[31:30.720 --> 31:34.480]  I'll take credit for part of those screw ups because I'm the one that made the seeds.
[31:34.520 --> 31:40.640]  But when this is done right, we get quality, reliable, feminized seeds.
[31:40.640 --> 31:42.880]  So I hope that makes a little bit of sense.
[31:42.880 --> 31:48.320]  I make the thiosulfate and I spray the plants with it and magically that makes the plants
[31:48.320 --> 31:50.760]  turn into transsexuals.
[31:50.760 --> 31:51.760]  They're not male plants.
[31:51.760 --> 31:54.960]  They're reversed females is what we call them.
[31:54.960 --> 31:58.200]  That basically is how I am making feminized seeds.
[31:58.200 --> 31:59.600]  So these are not hermaphrodite seeds.
[31:59.600 --> 32:02.760]  I'm not taking hermaphroditic plants and using hermaphrodite pollen.
[32:02.760 --> 32:05.320]  I'm not doing anything crazy ridiculous.
[32:05.320 --> 32:07.320]  This is reliable science.
[32:07.320 --> 32:10.920]  The reason that a lot of people are afraid of feminized seeds is because when it was
[32:10.920 --> 32:17.400]  started there were other less reliable practices used to make fem seeds.
[32:17.400 --> 32:18.400]  Soma does another method.
[32:18.400 --> 32:23.040]  Since we talked about Soma earlier in the show, Soma does not use the silver thiosulfate
[32:23.040 --> 32:24.920]  method as often as I do.
[32:24.920 --> 32:28.460]  What Soma does is he lets his plants grow too long.
[32:28.460 --> 32:31.480]  So if he's got a 10 week flowering plant, he'll let it grow about 12 weeks.
[32:31.960 --> 32:36.560]  When a plant grows that long, it kind of stresses itself and then it herms out and creates pollen
[32:36.560 --> 32:37.560]  that way.
[32:37.560 --> 32:39.000]  That's what Soma is using.
[32:39.000 --> 32:44.040]  I've also heard of Soma taking a mature plant, and this sounds completely crazy to a lot
[32:44.040 --> 32:45.600]  of growers, but it'll make sense.
[32:45.600 --> 32:50.040]  He takes a completely mature plant and then he will light a small fire and he will put
[32:50.040 --> 32:53.920]  his plant too close to the fire where the plant panics.
[32:53.920 --> 32:56.000]  The plant feels like it's a forest fire coming.
[32:56.000 --> 33:00.040]  So that plant starts to create male flowers and it's a female plant.
[33:00.040 --> 33:01.040]  It's freaking out.
[33:01.600 --> 33:04.760]  It's triggering that survival instinct.
[33:04.760 --> 33:08.760]  So it makes those male flowers, which make pollen, and then Soma collects that pollen
[33:08.760 --> 33:11.080]  and sprinkles it onto other plants.
[33:11.080 --> 33:15.400]  And maybe this explains why feminized seeds are so damn expensive, because there are more
[33:15.400 --> 33:20.840]  steps into making feminized seeds than there are to making regular true breeding male female
[33:20.840 --> 33:21.840]  seeds.
[33:21.840 --> 33:25.400]  That's why it's hard for me to keep up because I have to reverse plants and I don't get as
[33:25.400 --> 33:29.640]  much pollen from reversing these plants as I do from a normal male.
[33:29.640 --> 33:30.640]  And it takes a little longer.
[33:30.640 --> 33:31.640]  All right.
[33:31.640 --> 33:35.200]  I feel like I told you enough about reversing plants.
[33:35.200 --> 33:36.480]  I think you should have caught on by now.
[33:36.480 --> 33:42.040]  Like I said, you're going to have to experiment with the dilutions and the application rates.
[33:42.040 --> 33:46.240]  In Ed Rosenthal's book, I don't have it next to me, The Oakster Damn Course Guide, the
[33:46.240 --> 33:47.240]  most...
[33:47.240 --> 33:51.000]  I'm not even sure that it's the most current, but Ed Rosenthal wrote an Oakster Damn Course
[33:51.000 --> 33:52.000]  Guide.
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.520]  And in that book, there is a recipe to make your own silver thiosulfate.
[33:56.520 --> 34:00.640]  The recipe does work, although for some plants, it will need some adjusting.
[34:00.640 --> 34:01.640]  That's just my advice.
[34:01.640 --> 34:02.880]  All right.
[34:02.880 --> 34:06.680]  I am going to take a fat dab and take a drink and try to get this frog out of my throat
[34:06.680 --> 34:08.200]  so that I can sound like an actual podcaster.
[34:08.200 --> 34:09.200]  Give me one second.
[34:09.200 --> 34:12.400]  I'll be right back, guys, and we will give some shout outs and wrap up the show.
[34:12.400 --> 34:13.400]  All right, guys, I'm back.
[34:13.400 --> 34:16.800]  I want to apologize for taking so many breaks on you this episode.
[34:16.800 --> 34:19.880]  Usually I have some guests that can cover me while I'm coughing and taking a drink or
[34:19.880 --> 34:21.400]  whatever, but today it was just me.
[34:21.400 --> 34:22.400]  So you had to bear with me.
[34:22.400 --> 34:23.400]  I apologize.
[34:23.400 --> 34:24.400]  I hope you enjoyed the show.
[34:24.560 --> 34:29.880]  I just took a big old fat dab of some Jack the Ripper Shatter made by my good friends
[34:29.880 --> 34:30.880]  at Terpex.
[34:30.880 --> 34:36.040]  I picked that up at the Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs.
[34:36.040 --> 34:41.320]  I don't shop at a lot of dispensaries because I'm self-sufficient, but I was low on shatter.
[34:41.320 --> 34:45.000]  I'm just between harvest right now, so I had to pick up a few grams of shatter.
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.320]  Dude, Green and Healthy Wellness on 212 South 21st Street in Colorado Springs has the hookups
[34:50.320 --> 34:52.240]  on Terpex Shatter.
[34:52.240 --> 34:55.080]  If you have to be a medical patient, so if you have a medical card and you were in the
[34:55.080 --> 34:59.720]  Colorado Springs area, shit, if you're in Pueblo or Denver, it's worth the hour drive
[34:59.720 --> 35:03.800]  to head to Green and Healthy Cannabis and pick up your Terpex Shatter.
[35:03.800 --> 35:04.800]  It's a great price.
[35:04.800 --> 35:08.160]  I can't tell you how much it is because they have member pricing, they have non-member
[35:08.160 --> 35:10.360]  pricing and they have quite a few tiers of pricing.
[35:10.360 --> 35:13.920]  I don't want to get you pumped up because sometimes they run out of the low pricing
[35:13.920 --> 35:14.920]  stuff.
[35:14.920 --> 35:18.640]  But dude, go to Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs and get some Terpex.
[35:18.640 --> 35:21.520]  Big shout out to John and John and Jordan and Jordan.
[35:21.520 --> 35:24.360]  Sound like a dispensary with two Johns and two Jordans in it.
[35:24.360 --> 35:25.360]  All right.
[35:25.360 --> 35:28.640]  Also, I want to give a big shout out to my friend, Claude the Candyman.
[35:28.640 --> 35:32.320]  Claude, if you're listening to this show, bro, big thanks, much respect.
[35:32.320 --> 35:34.320]  Guys, support Sweet Stone Candy.
[35:34.320 --> 35:36.800]  If you are in California, you can get your Sweet Stone Candy.
[35:36.800 --> 35:41.080]  I don't think it's available here in Colorado anymore, but much love, much respect to Claude
[35:41.080 --> 35:42.080]  the Candyman.
[35:42.080 --> 35:43.840]  Big shout out to Sweet Stone Candy.
[35:43.840 --> 35:47.440]  Also a big hug to Melissa and a little scratch on the head to Sticky the Dog.
[35:47.440 --> 35:48.440]  Shout out.
[35:48.440 --> 35:50.120]  Also, big huge shout out to my buddy, Hunt.
[35:50.120 --> 35:51.680]  I always owe you a big shout out, bro.
[35:51.680 --> 35:52.680]  You need to come on the show.
[35:52.680 --> 35:54.880]  Grimey Gatsby on the podcast.
[35:54.880 --> 35:56.520]  That's what I'm saying.
[35:56.520 --> 35:58.160]  We are having a growers meeting, you guys.
[35:58.160 --> 36:02.600]  We do these growers meetings in the back of Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[36:02.600 --> 36:07.400]  Jesse gets a topic started and then I will jump in and help him give a little grow lesson.
[36:07.400 --> 36:09.000]  I think we're going to talk about...
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.960]  Oh no, that's old.
[36:10.960 --> 36:12.280]  I don't even know what the topic is this week.
[36:12.280 --> 36:15.800]  I should text him and find out, but we're going to have a meeting.
[36:15.800 --> 36:20.600]  The meeting is on March 6th at 6pm at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[36:20.600 --> 36:24.320]  I'm grabbing the paper with the address right now because I don't remember the address.
[36:24.320 --> 36:26.040]  I do remember, but I don't want to say it wrong.
[36:26.040 --> 36:30.560]  It is 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[36:30.560 --> 36:31.560]  You were invited.
[36:31.560 --> 36:32.720]  That's right.
[36:32.720 --> 36:33.720]  You were invited.
[36:33.720 --> 36:36.680]  If you're listening to this podcast, I think you have to be 21 and over.
[36:36.680 --> 36:38.360]  It's a 21 and over event.
[36:38.360 --> 36:42.160]  If you're listening to the show and you're 21 and up, you can come to this event.
[36:42.160 --> 36:45.000]  It's at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies, March 6th at 6pm.
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  I will be there.
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.000]  Jesse will be there.
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.760]  There's a good chance Sean King-Cola will be there.
[36:50.760 --> 36:51.760]  Sometimes Smince shows up.
[36:51.760 --> 36:53.480]  Garden of Weeden comes.
[36:53.480 --> 36:55.160]  There will be a lot of cool people there.
[36:55.160 --> 36:56.520]  Sometimes we give away prizes.
[36:56.520 --> 36:57.520]  They give away prizes.
[36:57.520 --> 36:58.520]  It's not my event.
[36:58.520 --> 36:59.520]  I just help out.
[36:59.520 --> 37:01.880]  But big shout out to Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies for that.
[37:01.880 --> 37:04.080]  It's not like I'm going to start coughing again.
[37:04.080 --> 37:07.000]  I feel like I have a big coughing fit coming, so I'm going to try to wrap up the show pretty
[37:07.000 --> 37:08.000]  quickly.
[37:08.000 --> 37:09.000]  Just a short episode.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.200]  You guys seem to pay more attention when the episodes are shorter.
[37:11.200 --> 37:16.840]  I honestly get more completed listens to episodes under 45 minutes, so we might start
[37:16.840 --> 37:17.840]  doing that.
[37:17.840 --> 37:20.040]  If you have a show idea, message me.
[37:20.040 --> 37:21.840]  I'd love to hear your show ideas.
[37:21.840 --> 37:25.720]  This show came all out of emails that I received from listeners.
[37:25.720 --> 37:28.840]  I made this show just for you because of your questions.
[37:28.840 --> 37:30.720]  So if you want to hear something, let me know.
[37:30.720 --> 37:31.720]  Don't feel shy.
[37:31.720 --> 37:32.720]  Don't feel like you're begging.
[37:32.720 --> 37:38.160]  I will do a show based on what you want to hear because this show is for you, not me.
[37:38.160 --> 37:39.160]  So I'm going to close the show up.
[37:39.160 --> 37:40.320]  Thanks for listening to another episode.
[37:40.440 --> 37:41.440]  I'll be back in another week.
[37:41.440 --> 37:44.640]  Hey, I said that the Dragonflight Earth Medicine people were coming.
[37:44.640 --> 37:48.280]  It turns out our schedules kind of missed each other.
[37:48.280 --> 37:50.600]  They are in Washington up near Canada right now.
[37:50.600 --> 37:54.080]  I may set up a Skype interview, but I never...
[37:54.080 --> 37:57.480]  When podcasts do Skype and phone interviews, I usually don't listen because it sounds like
[37:57.480 --> 37:58.480]  shit.
[37:58.480 --> 38:02.400]  So unless I can get a really quality recording out of it, I won't do it to tell you the truth.
[38:02.400 --> 38:06.200]  I'll wait for them to come to Colorado and I will interview them in person.
[38:06.200 --> 38:09.360]  So I hyped you guys up that the Dragonflight Earth Medicine people are coming.
[38:09.400 --> 38:10.400]  There's a miscommunication.
[38:10.400 --> 38:12.120]  They're currently in Washington.
[38:12.120 --> 38:13.120]  I am in Colorado.
[38:13.120 --> 38:15.160]  Yeah, you heard me.
[38:15.160 --> 38:17.360]  If I can make it happen through a good phone interview, I will.
[38:17.360 --> 38:20.600]  If it's not quality, I will never play it because I hate it when I hear a crappy phone
[38:20.600 --> 38:22.280]  interview on a podcast.
[38:22.280 --> 38:27.640]  But I'm going to try to get Sean and Jesse back for a soil recycling episode really soon.
[38:27.640 --> 38:28.960]  I've got a lot of cool stuff lined up.
[38:28.960 --> 38:31.000]  The Cannabis Cup is coming up here pretty soon.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.180]  Actually, it's my birthday right now.
[38:33.180 --> 38:36.280]  So I got a lot of fun shit happening this week.
[38:36.280 --> 38:39.240]  If you're interested in sponsoring the podcast or if you have a product you'd like us to
[38:39.320 --> 38:40.320]  review, send me an email.
[38:40.320 --> 38:43.840]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com and I'll get you all the information that you need.
[38:43.840 --> 38:47.560]  Also, don't forget to check out our sponsors, the Rocky Mountain Worm Company and Hydro Indoor
[38:47.560 --> 38:48.560]  Growing Supplies.
[38:48.560 --> 38:51.720]  Don't forget about the new coupon code at naturesgreenremedies.com.
[38:51.720 --> 38:53.920]  That coupon code is SPRING15.
[38:53.920 --> 38:59.440]  Wow, as I was saying that, Yankee from Nature's Green Remedies just messaged me to confirm
[38:59.440 --> 39:01.920]  that he got the new coupon code I gave him.
[39:01.920 --> 39:02.920]  That is pretty neat.
[39:02.920 --> 39:04.520]  So that coupon code is up and active, you guys.
[39:04.520 --> 39:07.520]  SPRING15 at naturesgreenremedies.com.
[39:07.520 --> 39:09.640]  Now that the show is over, please go to iTunes or Stitcher.
[39:09.640 --> 39:13.680]  Go to the iTunes store or yeah, go to the iTunes store, search for Grow From Your Heart
[39:13.680 --> 39:14.680]  or on Stitcher.
[39:14.680 --> 39:15.680]  You got to find the review section.
[39:15.680 --> 39:19.160]  Do it on the individual episodes, I guess, because Stitcher sucks for leaving reviews.
[39:19.160 --> 39:20.720]  Give me a five-star rating.
[39:20.720 --> 39:21.720]  After that, type in a comment.
[39:21.720 --> 39:25.960]  Let me know what you think of the show and I will read your comments on a future episode.
[39:25.960 --> 39:28.560]  Like I said, Stitcher keeps changing the way the comments are done on there.
[39:28.560 --> 39:31.080]  Just leave a comment and I will do my best to find it.
[39:31.080 --> 39:34.360]  If you have something to say and you're not into the social media thing, you can always

[39:40.800 --> 39:44.440]  is archived on iReedGeneticsColorado.com.

[40:20.100 --> 40:21.300]  up there.
[40:21.300 --> 40:23.940]  I had my web guy put the button up and he has not contributed yet.
[40:23.940 --> 40:27.100]  I'm hoping that he hears this because my web guy spent a few minutes putting that up there
[40:27.100 --> 40:28.100]  for me.
[40:28.100 --> 40:29.100]  I'm just being a smart ass, you guys.

[40:45.020 --> 40:46.020]  week.
[40:46.020 --> 40:47.020]  What's up, Jeff?
[40:47.020 --> 40:48.020]  What's up, John?
[40:48.020 --> 40:49.020]  I hope you guys listened to the podcast.
[40:49.020 --> 40:50.020]  I had a great time with you this week.
[40:50.020 --> 40:51.020]  Had a great dinner last night.
[40:51.020 --> 40:52.020]  You guys are kicking ass.
[40:52.020 --> 40:53.020]  Yeah, everybody, thanks for listening.
[40:53.020 --> 40:54.020]  Until next time, take a big fat dab.
[40:54.020 --> 40:55.020]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[40:55.020 --> 40:56.020]  We used to aim for the sky.
[40:56.020 --> 40:57.020]  Now we higher than Mars.
[40:57.020 --> 40:58.020]  On the rise till we shatter.
[40:58.020 --> 40:59.020]  We're the best in the world.
[40:59.020 --> 41:00.020]  We're the best in the world.
[41:00.020 --> 41:01.020]  We're the best in the world.
[41:01.020 --> 41:02.020]  We're the best in the world.
[41:02.020 --> 41:05.020]  On the rise till we shine like the fire of stars.
[41:05.020 --> 41:07.020]  Son, I create, you admire it all.
[41:07.020 --> 41:10.020]  Buy the line from my rhymes, I'ma wire your jaw.
[41:10.020 --> 41:24.400]  Check my numbers, game is uncontained by a data sheet.
[41:24.400 --> 41:26.400]  I run the game while you drag your feet.
[41:26.400 --> 41:28.400]  I'm unashamed with my love for fame.
[41:28.400 --> 41:32.400]  Cause my life was mundane, now it's feeling magnifique.
[41:32.400 --> 41:34.400]  First place and we moving above.
[41:34.400 --> 41:37.400]  Fluid and love under the influence of drugs.
[41:37.400 --> 42:03.500]  You speak hate, we could ruin your mom.
[42:03.500 --> 42:05.500]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[42:05.500 --> 42:08.500]  It's time for episode number 56 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[42:08.500 --> 42:11.500]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[42:11.500 --> 42:14.500]  If you're a new grower, if you're a pro grower,
[42:14.500 --> 42:16.500]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[42:16.500 --> 42:17.500]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[42:17.500 --> 42:20.500]  or if you're just someone who's curious about the current state of cannabis,
[42:20.500 --> 42:22.500]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[42:22.500 --> 42:23.500]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[42:23.500 --> 42:24.500]  Thanks again for joining me.
[42:24.500 --> 42:26.500]  As always, before we get started,
[42:26.500 --> 42:28.500]  I have to send a big, huge thank you shout out to Kooten Cat
[42:28.500 --> 42:29.500]  from the Mystic Roots Band.
[42:29.500 --> 42:31.500]  Thanks a lot for letting me use your music.
[42:31.500 --> 42:34.500]  Joining me today again is one of our heroes.
[42:34.500 --> 42:35.500]  Welcome back, dude.
[42:35.500 --> 42:36.500]  We got King Cola to the left.
[42:36.500 --> 42:37.500]  How are you, bro?
[42:37.500 --> 42:38.500]  Good, man.
[42:38.500 --> 42:39.500]  Thanks for having me.
[42:39.500 --> 42:40.500]  Oh, dude, thanks for coming.
[42:40.500 --> 42:41.500]  We're excited about this.
[42:41.500 --> 42:43.500]  Sean is going to drop some knowledge on you guys today
[42:43.500 --> 42:47.500]  that is going to fuck up your whole thought process on growing.
[42:48.500 --> 42:53.500]  Yeah, so I'm here to give out some information.
[42:53.500 --> 42:55.500]  You can take it or leave it.
[42:55.500 --> 42:56.500]  I'm not telling you.
[42:56.500 --> 42:58.500]  That mic has impotency problems.
[42:58.500 --> 43:00.500]  It likes to droop after a while.
[43:00.500 --> 43:02.500]  Yeah, so I'm not,
[43:02.500 --> 43:05.500]  my word is not law by any means,
[43:05.500 --> 43:09.500]  but this is just my, how I grow.
[43:09.500 --> 43:14.500]  This is what I have discovered through my personal studies,
[43:14.500 --> 43:19.500]  but I just want to say stop using molasses in your teas.
[43:20.500 --> 43:23.500]  And yeah, I mean, completely.
[43:23.500 --> 43:25.500]  And the main reason is,
[43:25.500 --> 43:29.500]  is a lot of people are using molasses on a regular basis.
[43:29.500 --> 43:30.500]  Typically, when you ask somebody
[43:30.500 --> 43:32.500]  what they're using in your compost tea,
[43:32.500 --> 43:34.500]  and the same for me.
[43:34.500 --> 43:36.500]  I think probably on the first episode,
[43:36.500 --> 43:40.500]  I probably even recommended certain rates to use molasses at.
[43:40.500 --> 43:41.500]  I think so.
[43:41.500 --> 43:43.500]  And, you know, so I mean, you just,
[43:43.500 --> 43:45.500]  this is an evolving industry.
[43:45.500 --> 43:46.500]  Everything changes.
[43:46.500 --> 43:47.500]  We learn as we go.
[43:47.500 --> 43:51.500]  But, so I cut, I heard a while ago, basically,
[43:51.500 --> 43:52.500]  you need to quit using,
[43:52.500 --> 43:54.500]  somebody told me you need to quit using molasses.
[43:54.500 --> 43:55.500]  I said, why?
[43:55.500 --> 43:57.500]  And they were, you know, I'll get back to you.
[43:57.500 --> 43:59.500]  And I never heard from them again,
[43:59.500 --> 44:01.500]  but it stuck in my head.
[44:01.500 --> 44:03.500]  So I quit using molasses, just cut it out.
[44:03.500 --> 44:05.500]  And I didn't see a difference.
[44:05.500 --> 44:06.500]  You know what I mean?
[44:06.500 --> 44:09.500]  It's not like things quit working.
[44:09.500 --> 44:11.500]  So it's not acting like the bud hardener and the sweetener,
[44:11.500 --> 44:13.500]  like we think it is maybe.
[44:13.500 --> 44:14.500]  Yeah.
[44:14.500 --> 44:15.500]  You know, I didn't, I didn't see it.
[44:15.500 --> 44:17.500]  So I'm doing my thing.
[44:17.500 --> 44:19.500]  And then I get back in touch with this person
[44:19.500 --> 44:21.500]  and we kind of discuss it a little more.
[44:21.500 --> 44:24.500]  And a lot of people,
[44:24.500 --> 44:26.500]  like I was saying for a basic compost tea,
[44:26.500 --> 44:27.500]  what I used to recommend,
[44:28.500 --> 44:31.500]  and a lot of people are using are earthworm castings
[44:31.500 --> 44:35.500]  or Alaskan humus or some sort of humic acid.
[44:35.500 --> 44:39.500]  They're using molasses and then they're using like a kelp meal
[44:39.500 --> 44:40.500]  or something.
[44:40.500 --> 44:41.500]  Well,
[44:41.500 --> 44:46.500]  the reason that you use that molasses in the tea is actually not for the
[44:46.500 --> 44:50.500]  reason that you had mentioned early when you use, excuse me,
[44:50.500 --> 44:52.500]  when you use the molasses in a tea,
[44:52.500 --> 44:56.500]  it's not for not so much as a bud hardener for the plant.
[44:56.500 --> 45:01.500]  It's not so much a carbohydrate for the plant as it is a food source for
[45:01.500 --> 45:02.500]  the microbes in the tea.
[45:02.500 --> 45:03.500]  Right.
[45:03.500 --> 45:04.500]  In our teas.
[45:04.500 --> 45:05.500]  Okay.
[45:05.500 --> 45:09.500]  And the thing with molasses is it's a simple carbohydrate and simple
[45:09.500 --> 45:11.500]  carbohydrates feed simple organisms.
[45:11.500 --> 45:14.500]  And that's the simplest way to say it.
[45:14.500 --> 45:18.500]  So molasses is an extremely strong bacteria food.
[45:18.500 --> 45:23.500]  You've probably heard before that marijuana is a fungal dominant plant.
[45:24.500 --> 45:26.500]  They like fungal dominant teas, especially in flower.
[45:26.500 --> 45:27.500]  Okay.
[45:27.500 --> 45:29.500]  So by using molasses,
[45:29.500 --> 45:32.500]  you're going to be encouraging bacterial growth.
[45:32.500 --> 45:33.500]  Well,
[45:33.500 --> 45:38.500]  the molasses not only feeds the bacteria,
[45:38.500 --> 45:41.500]  but it feeds it in an enormous rate.
[45:41.500 --> 45:43.500]  Bacteria is naturally occurring.
[45:43.500 --> 45:44.500]  It's everywhere.
[45:44.500 --> 45:45.500]  It's already in the soil.
[45:45.500 --> 45:46.500]  It's on our skin.
[45:46.500 --> 45:48.500]  It's everywhere.
[45:48.500 --> 45:49.500]  And in between.
[45:49.500 --> 45:52.500]  So it's already going to be there in your tea.
[45:52.500 --> 45:53.500]  It's going to be in your water.
[45:53.500 --> 45:54.500]  It's going to be in your soil.
[45:54.500 --> 45:55.500]  You know,
[45:55.500 --> 45:57.500]  probably some of it's already going to be in molasses.
[45:57.500 --> 46:01.500]  So there's plenty of bacteria out there.
[46:01.500 --> 46:02.500]  As you add this molasses,
[46:02.500 --> 46:08.500]  you start to feed this bacteria and the bacteria starts to eat the food and
[46:08.500 --> 46:09.500]  they start to digest.
[46:09.500 --> 46:14.500]  And what happens is the growth of the bacteria happens too fast.
[46:14.500 --> 46:19.500]  And the organisms will actually use up all of the available food and oxygen
[46:19.500 --> 46:20.500]  resources.
[46:20.500 --> 46:24.500]  So you actually drop the dissolved oxygen levels in your tea.
[46:24.500 --> 46:29.500]  So putting molasses in your AAC tea will take out one of those A's.
[46:29.500 --> 46:33.500]  It will make it go anaerobic and you will no longer be having an aerated
[46:33.500 --> 46:34.500]  compost tea.
[46:34.500 --> 46:36.500]  Despite you having bubblers running,
[46:36.500 --> 46:39.500]  you'll still going to take out the oxygen.
[46:39.500 --> 46:41.500]  You'll lower the dissolved oxygen levels.
[46:41.500 --> 46:44.500]  Then you're just harvesting anaerobic bacteria.
[46:44.500 --> 46:46.500]  Basically killing off everything we're working to create.
[46:46.500 --> 46:47.500]  Exactly.
[46:48.500 --> 46:50.500]  By adding the thing that we thought was fueling our fire.
[46:50.500 --> 46:51.500]  Exactly.
[46:51.500 --> 46:52.500]  By adding molasses,
[46:52.500 --> 46:56.500]  you're just taking out everything that you just put all of your money and
[46:56.500 --> 46:57.500]  time into.
[46:57.500 --> 47:01.500]  You're just growing the bacteria at a phenomenal rate.
[47:01.500 --> 47:03.500]  They're out competing everything else.
[47:03.500 --> 47:06.500]  And that's eventually what you put on your plant.
[47:06.500 --> 47:08.500]  I just Googled fungal dominance.
[47:08.500 --> 47:11.500]  We can do an entire episode on that just by what I'm reading.
[47:11.500 --> 47:12.500]  Yes.
[47:12.500 --> 47:13.500]  You guys are going to have to go.
[47:13.500 --> 47:14.500]  If you want to catch up,
[47:14.500 --> 47:15.500]  Google fungal dominance.
[47:15.500 --> 47:16.500]  I can't even begin to explain it.
[47:16.500 --> 47:18.500]  There is so much going on in fungal dominance.
[47:18.500 --> 47:19.500]  Wow.
[47:19.500 --> 47:20.500]  That'll change your thinking,
[47:20.500 --> 47:21.500]  but right there.
[47:21.500 --> 47:22.500]  Yeah,
[47:22.500 --> 47:23.500]  definitely.
[47:23.500 --> 47:25.500]  With the teas,
[47:25.500 --> 47:26.500]  like I was saying,
[47:26.500 --> 47:28.500]  when you add the molasses,
[47:28.500 --> 47:31.500]  it can drop the dissolved oxygen levels.
[47:31.500 --> 47:33.500]  For anybody who's listening,
[47:33.500 --> 47:35.500]  who wants to know specifically,
[47:35.500 --> 47:39.500]  above eight parts per million of dissolved oxygen is where you want your
[47:39.500 --> 47:40.500]  teas.
[47:40.500 --> 47:43.500]  That's when you're brewing aerobic organisms.
[47:43.500 --> 47:46.500]  Between six parts per million and eight parts per million,
[47:46.500 --> 47:49.500]  you are facilitating anaerobic zones.
[47:49.500 --> 47:53.500]  These organisms outcompete the aerobic organisms at a rate of two to one.
[47:53.500 --> 47:55.500]  These facilitate anaerobic zones.
[47:55.500 --> 47:59.500]  This is where some really nasty things live.
[47:59.500 --> 48:01.500]  These things are in your compost.
[48:01.500 --> 48:06.500]  You are like these bad organisms are in your compost,
[48:06.500 --> 48:07.500]  such as,
[48:07.500 --> 48:08.500]  you know,
[48:08.500 --> 48:09.500]  really anaerobic or E.
[48:09.500 --> 48:10.500]  coli or these other things,
[48:10.500 --> 48:11.500]  just nasties.
[48:12.500 --> 48:14.500]  They're going to multiply at an alarming rate.
[48:14.500 --> 48:18.500]  Once you start creating this anaerobic environment.
[48:18.500 --> 48:20.500]  And if you use that as a foliar spray,
[48:20.500 --> 48:21.500]  you just sprayed E.
[48:21.500 --> 48:22.500]  coli under your plants,
[48:22.500 --> 48:23.500]  right?
[48:23.500 --> 48:24.500]  Yeah.
[48:24.500 --> 48:25.500]  And that's the thing is they actually like when you,
[48:25.500 --> 48:26.500]  your tea starts to do that,
[48:26.500 --> 48:30.500]  the organisms are produced acids that kill anaerobic organisms and high
[48:30.500 --> 48:31.500]  enough qualities.
[48:31.500 --> 48:33.500]  These acids can stress and kill your plant.
[48:33.500 --> 48:36.500]  And in no growing environment anywhere,
[48:36.500 --> 48:38.500]  is there a shortage of bacteria?
[48:39.500 --> 48:44.500]  So there's no need to just feed more of them and stress your plants out.
[48:44.500 --> 48:48.500]  And there's other options instead of molasses.
[48:48.500 --> 48:51.500]  So right off the bat,
[48:51.500 --> 48:52.500]  just cut it out.
[48:52.500 --> 48:57.500]  So if you want to do a T what I would recommend to would be actually
[48:57.500 --> 48:59.500]  here in one second,
[48:59.500 --> 49:00.500]  but yeah,
[49:00.500 --> 49:05.500]  so if you're going to start a T I would just go with worm castings.
[49:06.500 --> 49:11.500]  I would go with a kelp meal and that's just about it.
[49:14.500 --> 49:15.500]  Castings and kelp meal.
[49:15.500 --> 49:16.500]  Yeah.
[49:16.500 --> 49:17.500]  I'm sorry.
[49:17.500 --> 49:18.500]  I'm trying to,
[49:18.500 --> 49:19.500]  I've got everything right now.
[49:19.500 --> 49:20.500]  So yeah,
[49:20.500 --> 49:21.500]  there you go.
[49:21.500 --> 49:22.500]  He's got his,
[49:22.500 --> 49:23.500]  he's got a whole computer in front of them.
[49:23.500 --> 49:24.500]  You guys.
[49:24.500 --> 49:25.500]  So I tried to come prepared.
[49:25.500 --> 49:26.500]  He came well prepared.
[49:26.500 --> 49:27.500]  I kind of peeked at his notes a minute ago.
[49:27.500 --> 49:28.500]  He's got a lot of info.
[49:28.500 --> 49:29.500]  Yeah.
[49:29.500 --> 49:30.500]  So we've got a,
[49:30.500 --> 49:31.500]  so basically for,
[49:31.500 --> 49:32.500]  for really basic compost tea,
[49:32.500 --> 49:33.500]  I'm going to roll with Dr.
[49:33.500 --> 49:34.500]  Elaine Ingram's compost tea.
[49:34.500 --> 49:36.500]  Her teas are basically compost or,
[49:36.500 --> 49:37.500]  you know,
[49:37.500 --> 49:39.500]  worm castings or whatever you can source.
[49:41.500 --> 49:42.500]  Kelp meal.
[49:43.500 --> 49:45.500]  And then you can add in,
[49:45.500 --> 49:47.500]  instead of molasses,
[49:47.500 --> 49:49.500]  you can add in a humic source.
[49:49.500 --> 49:52.500]  So you can add in like a humic acid derived from Pete,
[49:52.500 --> 49:54.500]  like a dragon flyer with medicines,
[49:54.500 --> 49:55.500]  brilliant black.
[49:55.500 --> 49:58.500]  There's a lot of recommend actually.
[49:58.500 --> 49:59.500]  Yeah.
[49:59.500 --> 50:00.500]  There's a lot of different options out there,
[50:00.500 --> 50:02.500]  but you can add in a humic acid or,
[50:02.500 --> 50:03.500]  or in that place you could add in a,
[50:04.500 --> 50:05.500]  fish hydro slate.
[50:05.500 --> 50:08.500]  So for your base teas,
[50:08.500 --> 50:13.500]  every time I would just go with worm castings and water outside of that,
[50:13.500 --> 50:17.500]  you can add in kelp meal or alfalfa meal or anything like that specific to
[50:17.500 --> 50:18.500]  your stage,
[50:18.500 --> 50:20.500]  your plant stage in life.
[50:20.500 --> 50:23.500]  And then if you want to start adding foods for the fungi,
[50:23.500 --> 50:25.500]  basically if you're in veg,
[50:25.500 --> 50:27.500]  fish hydro slate.
[50:27.500 --> 50:29.500]  So for vegetative growth,
[50:29.500 --> 50:30.500]  instead of using molasses,
[50:30.500 --> 50:32.500]  replace it with fish hydro slate.
[50:32.500 --> 50:33.500]  Now fish hydro slate,
[50:33.500 --> 50:34.500]  it can,
[50:34.500 --> 50:36.500]  it can go the same way as molasses.
[50:36.500 --> 50:39.500]  It can turn your tea anaerobic really fast.
[50:39.500 --> 50:42.500]  And I know you're probably thinking anaerobic.
[50:42.500 --> 50:43.500]  Well,
[50:43.500 --> 50:44.500]  you know,
[50:44.500 --> 50:48.500]  I've personally talked about anaerobic teas and bukashi and all of these
[50:48.500 --> 50:49.500]  things,
[50:49.500 --> 50:50.500]  which is,
[50:50.500 --> 50:51.500]  you know,
[50:51.500 --> 50:53.500]  they're actually anaerobic fermentations and anaerobic,
[50:53.500 --> 50:54.500]  anaerobic compost.
[50:54.500 --> 50:55.500]  That's completely different.
[50:55.500 --> 50:58.500]  That's because we want anaerobic environments.
[50:59.500 --> 51:03.500]  We don't want anaerobic bacteria in our aerobic teas.
[51:03.500 --> 51:04.500]  Okay.
[51:04.500 --> 51:05.500]  You know,
[51:05.500 --> 51:07.500]  so they're separate but equal.
[51:07.500 --> 51:10.500]  We're making a tea and then feeding that to our exactly.
[51:10.500 --> 51:11.500]  You don't.
[51:11.500 --> 51:12.500]  Yeah.
[51:12.500 --> 51:13.500]  You know,
[51:13.500 --> 51:14.500]  so when you're fermenting,
[51:14.500 --> 51:15.500]  don't let oxygen get into it.
[51:15.500 --> 51:16.500]  And when you're aerating,
[51:16.500 --> 51:18.500]  don't let it go stagnant.
[51:18.500 --> 51:19.500]  Write that down to guys.
[51:19.500 --> 51:24.500]  So as far as food for your teas,
[51:24.500 --> 51:25.500]  like I was saying,
[51:25.500 --> 51:27.500]  if you need to improve your fungal count,
[51:27.500 --> 51:29.500]  which everybody wants to,
[51:29.500 --> 51:31.500]  everybody wants fungal dominant teas.
[51:31.500 --> 51:34.500]  You can add a steel cut oat bran or steel cut oats,
[51:34.500 --> 51:36.500]  brand powder,
[51:36.500 --> 51:38.500]  shrimp shells.
[51:38.500 --> 51:39.500]  I mean,
[51:39.500 --> 51:43.500]  there's any sort of really any sort of like high protein.
[51:43.500 --> 51:45.500]  We can just pick that up at the health food store.
[51:45.500 --> 51:46.500]  Right.
[51:46.500 --> 51:47.500]  You can pick all of that up.
[51:47.500 --> 51:48.500]  Actually.
[51:48.500 --> 51:49.500]  There's a lot of like,
[51:49.500 --> 51:52.500]  I've seen a lot of stuff on people are people are starting to consume like
[51:52.500 --> 51:54.500]  fish hydroslate and stuff.
[51:55.500 --> 51:57.500]  Which I don't know if I'm there yet,
[51:57.500 --> 51:59.500]  but I mean,
[51:59.500 --> 52:01.500]  I wouldn't be surprised if you can pick that up at the health food store
[52:01.500 --> 52:02.500]  soon.
[52:02.500 --> 52:03.500]  Eventually.
[52:03.500 --> 52:04.500]  Right.
[52:04.500 --> 52:06.500]  But yeah.
[52:06.500 --> 52:09.500]  So just molasses.
[52:09.500 --> 52:10.500]  I mean,
[52:10.500 --> 52:13.500]  take it how you want it and you're going to take it or leave it.
[52:13.500 --> 52:15.500]  I recommend cutting it out.
[52:15.500 --> 52:20.500]  I think I've learned from very reputable sources and you know,
[52:20.500 --> 52:21.500]  there,
[52:21.500 --> 52:22.500]  these aren't people just,
[52:22.500 --> 52:23.500]  you know,
[52:23.500 --> 52:24.500]  talking,
[52:24.500 --> 52:25.500]  you know,
[52:25.500 --> 52:26.500]  shit.
[52:26.500 --> 52:28.500]  These are real scientists.
[52:28.500 --> 52:31.500]  These guys are sitting there in front of their microscopes and they're
[52:31.500 --> 52:34.500]  straining their minds and their eyes.
[52:34.500 --> 52:35.500]  So we don't have to,
[52:35.500 --> 52:36.500]  no,
[52:36.500 --> 52:38.500]  I don't think you need to try to give yourself any sort of credit or your
[52:38.500 --> 52:39.500]  sources.
[52:39.500 --> 52:40.500]  You've been on here enough.
[52:40.500 --> 52:42.500]  And I think people have realized that you are definitely not full of shit.
[52:42.500 --> 52:44.500]  I think you've earned your credit here.
[52:44.500 --> 52:45.500]  I'm going to give it to you.
[52:45.500 --> 52:46.500]  Well,
[52:46.500 --> 52:47.500]  thank you.
[52:47.500 --> 52:48.500]  We respect your opinion.
[52:48.500 --> 52:49.500]  I respect your opinion.
[52:49.500 --> 52:50.500]  Well,
[52:50.500 --> 52:51.500]  thank you for being a part of the conversation.
[52:51.500 --> 52:52.500]  I'm a big fan of yours and you teach me stuff every time you come.
[52:52.500 --> 52:53.500]  No,
[52:53.500 --> 52:54.500]  I really appreciate it.
[52:54.500 --> 52:55.500]  And,
[52:55.500 --> 52:56.500]  uh,
[52:56.500 --> 52:57.500]  but yes,
[52:57.500 --> 52:58.500]  I mean,
[52:58.500 --> 52:59.500]  just cut the,
[52:59.500 --> 53:00.500]  cut the molasses out of your teas.
[53:00.500 --> 53:01.500]  I used to use it every fucking day.
[53:01.500 --> 53:02.500]  I mean,
[53:02.500 --> 53:04.500]  every time my last batch of tea and you know what,
[53:04.500 --> 53:05.500]  I didn't see much of a difference.
[53:05.500 --> 53:06.500]  I used,
[53:06.500 --> 53:09.500]  I used to use your recommendation or the revs recommendation of molasses
[53:09.500 --> 53:10.500]  in my tea.
[53:10.500 --> 53:12.500]  And I made a tea just a few days ago with some,
[53:12.500 --> 53:13.500]  uh,
[53:13.500 --> 53:14.500]  Bokashi bucket leachate in there.
[53:14.500 --> 53:18.500]  And I actually got way more foam without the molasses on that bucket than
[53:18.500 --> 53:21.980]  bucket than I've ever made. That's the best tea I've ever made was my most
[53:21.980 --> 53:26.540]  recent without the molasses. And the plants love it. Yeah you're gonna get way better
[53:26.540 --> 53:32.540]  results using beneficial microorganisms, using things like cold-processed fish
[53:32.540 --> 53:36.380]  hydroslate, like the Brown's fish hydroslate you grabbed from Rocky Mount
[53:36.380 --> 53:42.300]  Worm Company, or you can make your own fish hydroslate. But those food sources
[53:42.300 --> 53:47.300]  work way better. They're way more natural. Looks just like us. If we eat natural
[53:47.300 --> 53:51.380]  food, our body absorbs it much more naturally. Instead of trying to go to McDonald's or whatever,
[53:51.380 --> 53:54.740]  pull out the nutrients and poop out the crap, instead you're able to
[53:54.740 --> 53:58.380]  absorb what you're eating. It's like eating a pop-tart or an apple.
[53:58.380 --> 54:05.420]  Yeah. I mean it's you know how does your body run off of it? But yeah, so for
[54:05.420 --> 54:12.820]  teas, just keep it simpler the better. You know, just run your castings, run you
[54:12.820 --> 54:17.460]  know your kelp. If you want to add a food source, you can. I like, I really like
[54:17.460 --> 54:22.220]  fish hydroslate during veg. You see tremendous vegetative growth and then
[54:22.220 --> 54:25.700]  that's how you really step away from bottled nutrients. You know that way if
[54:25.700 --> 54:29.300]  you are using bottled nutrients, the only one you're using is a fish product.
[54:29.300 --> 54:35.380]  What are we using, sorry to cut you off, what are we using to feed the tea in bloom?
[54:35.380 --> 54:40.340]  You keep saying fish hydroslate and veg. Okay, so for if you're gonna feed your tea in bloom,
[54:40.380 --> 54:45.700]  soft rock phosphate. There we go. Yeah, that's a lot in your OGT. So soft rock
[54:45.700 --> 54:49.740]  phosphate, but that goes right back into you need to know what you're using, how
[54:49.740 --> 54:53.300]  much you're using, where you're sourcing it from. You go and you dump
[54:53.300 --> 54:57.580]  astronomical amount of soft rock phosphate on your plant, you're gonna,
[54:57.580 --> 55:02.060]  you know, like I said that goes right back to you can be organic and you can
[55:02.060 --> 55:06.140]  be worse than all your synthetic buddies out there. Right, actually I think I
[55:06.220 --> 55:10.820]  overused some OGT because I wasn't, I was thinking, oh it's OGT, let's fuck it up.
[55:10.820 --> 55:13.540]  So I fed it, instead of every two weeks, I was doing it every week because I wasn't
[55:13.540 --> 55:17.380]  paying attention and I think the plant sped up too much like you said because
[55:17.380 --> 55:20.580]  they were showing nitrogen deficiencies in like week five. Yeah.
[55:20.580 --> 55:24.940]  And I think they're just going too fast. That's more from like the trichoderma
[55:24.940 --> 55:29.580]  like strains that they have in there, but he has soft rock phosphate also in there
[55:29.580 --> 55:34.220]  which works as a food for the microbes and it's a fungal food, but you can also
[55:34.380 --> 55:39.500]  get your phosphates obviously from introducing that into the tea. So it's a
[55:39.500 --> 55:45.380]  great, that's a great source of, if you need a bloom tea for say, theoretically
[55:45.380 --> 55:48.860]  you should have all of that amended in your soil and it'll just kind of take up
[55:48.860 --> 55:54.300]  what it wants, which kind of rolls into what we were originally. Yeah, that was our
[55:54.300 --> 55:58.260]  original idea today was to talk about building a little bit of soil. So I
[55:58.260 --> 56:01.940]  believe you, I like your guys, the molasses is unnecessary, those are old
[56:01.940 --> 56:07.100]  school farmer tricks we were taught that, try it yourself, make a, do a test run,
[56:07.100 --> 56:11.060]  set one set of plants on one side of the room, one set on the other, add molasses
[56:11.060 --> 56:15.300]  to one set of tea or however you're feeding, don't add molasses to the
[56:15.300 --> 56:19.300]  other, see the difference for yourself. It's, you're not gonna see enough
[56:19.300 --> 56:22.900]  difference to like break the bank or anything, so give it a try. Yeah, and I
[56:22.900 --> 56:27.820]  mean keep your molasses around. I use it for plenty of stuff, FPJs, a lot of the
[56:27.820 --> 56:32.340]  fermented plant juice, yeah, a lot of the Korean farming techniques that I do, a lot
[56:32.340 --> 56:35.780]  of the homemade fertilizers I use molasses, and like I said, if you're gonna
[56:35.780 --> 56:41.500]  use it for your sweetener purposes or your hardener purposes or your foliar
[56:41.500 --> 56:46.100]  sprays or, if you use it for stuff but don't use it for the tea's food source
[56:46.100 --> 56:50.820]  and don't use it every time. Don't use it for your tea's food source guys, we're
[56:50.820 --> 56:54.100]  over, we're like over amping the tea basically, we're making hyper little tea.
[56:54.100 --> 56:57.380]  It's all back to you. It's turning into little kids just like sugar. Yeah, they're out
[56:57.380 --> 57:03.460]  competing everybody. Yeah, all right. So yeah, for soil mixes, I really didn't even
[57:03.460 --> 57:08.020]  know where to start for this one. I know that everybody has their own mix,
[57:08.020 --> 57:14.660]  everybody has their way of doing things, there's super soils and there's layers
[57:14.660 --> 57:20.260]  and there's no till, there's a million ways to do everything, so I just, I
[57:20.380 --> 57:24.580]  figured maybe the best way to go about it would be to kind of just discuss, you
[57:24.580 --> 57:30.940]  know, what they are. Okay, that sounds great. Yeah, so a super soil, super
[57:30.940 --> 57:40.380]  soils are a term for a nutrient-charged soil. Subcool is the father of super
[57:40.380 --> 57:47.060]  soils. Yeah, Subcool made it really famous. And basically the idea is you're gonna
[57:47.060 --> 57:51.700]  create this nutrient-rich mixture of soil and you're gonna layer the bottom
[57:51.700 --> 57:56.820]  of your pot with it and then you're gonna plant your plant actually into a
[57:56.820 --> 58:02.300]  less hot medium. Like so you would use a bagged soil, you would take your five
[58:02.300 --> 58:06.340]  gallon container and you'd fill the bottom so many inches up with your super
[58:06.340 --> 58:11.940]  soil mix and then add in your bagged soil and then actually transplant your
[58:11.940 --> 58:16.940]  plant into it. Theoretically you water your plant, the roots grow through the
[58:16.940 --> 58:22.660]  bagged soil medium into the super soil and then you never have to fertilize
[58:22.660 --> 58:26.420]  your plant. You can just always feed it water, you know, every time. Everything's
[58:26.420 --> 58:34.180]  already mixed into the soil. So that's one method of mixing. Another
[58:34.180 --> 58:41.300]  method for a lot of people is just like a complete through and through mix.
[58:41.300 --> 58:48.380]  So like Dragonfly Earth Medicine just does a really, really awesome mix where
[58:48.380 --> 58:53.620]  they do... it's similar to the super soil but it's actually incorporated throughout
[58:53.620 --> 58:57.780]  the entire mix. So you don't like... Stir the whole thing. Exactly. So there is no
[58:57.780 --> 59:02.380]  like layering and you don't pad it with, you know, other soil. What they'll do is
[59:02.380 --> 59:08.060]  they make their soil and then they do what's a term called cooking, which
[59:08.140 --> 59:12.100]  is just composting. So they let their soil sit for a couple of weeks or a
[59:12.100 --> 59:16.580]  month, you know, the longer the better. And by doing that you can really
[59:16.580 --> 59:20.140]  encourage natural processes. And if you go to Dragonfly Earth Medicine's feed,
[59:20.140 --> 59:24.780]  they've got some really cool things about how they'll, you know, the soil
[59:24.780 --> 59:28.940]  that's cooking they'll treat with Bukashi and lactic acid bacteria and
[59:28.940 --> 59:32.340]  they pour all their excess compost teas on it. And you can do these things too
[59:32.340 --> 59:36.980]  while your soil cooks. But they do them like really it's more of a botanical
[59:36.980 --> 59:42.860]  mixture. They use like a kelp meal, alfalfa, nettle. You can go to their
[59:42.860 --> 59:46.020]  website to their feeds and kind of find out. I don't want to give away all their...
[59:46.020 --> 59:49.100]  Yeah, go check them out. Definitely. But they've got some... Check out Dragonfly Earth
[59:49.100 --> 59:52.220]  Medicine. We'll get them on the show one day. They're in Canada. They said they
[59:52.220 --> 59:55.020]  were gonna come here and then they had to go back to Canada or Washington.
[59:55.020 --> 59:58.860]  They're right by Canada. Yeah. So they had to skip out on the show. The Pacific Northwest, they're just
[59:58.860 --> 01:00:02.860]  holding it down up there. Actually they're in Europe right now. Or if they
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:06.660]  went to like Prague or they went all over the... Istanbul. They're going everywhere.
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.140]  Because when they come back they're gonna do an interview with me and
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.380]  they're gonna tell me about all the things they've seen around the world.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:15.740]  That'll be great. Yeah, but they've been perfecting the soil mix for a while.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:22.060]  And you know I mentioned them because they do like a completely botanical base.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:25.940]  You know everything's plant-based with their mixes. I know a lot of other people
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:31.300]  are traditionally doing, especially like with the Rev and some other people.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:37.580]  Moonshine Man and there's a lot of other mixes out there which are all bone
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:43.980]  meal, blood meal, phosphates. It's real similar to Subcool's mix but it's the
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:47.540]  same idea that you mix it throughout the whole batch and you let it cook for a
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:50.940]  period of time and then you grow into it. And we got to get away from the blood
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:54.940]  meal and the bone meal. Yeah. The feather meal. Yeah, there's an alternative to me.
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:01:01.620]  Bone meal, soft rock phosphate, calm free metal, yarrow, fish bone meal.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:09.460]  There's other options. Blood meal which is your nitrogen source. Yeah, there's I
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:12.420]  don't even need to like get into it. There's so many other nitrogens.
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:18.060]  Alfalfa, fish hydrates. Yeah, there's so many other nitrogen sources. I don't
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:22.460]  even need to cover that. But I mean you definitely source where your products
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:33.100]  are coming from. Me personally, I go with a very simple mix. I use typically I like
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:40.460]  to mix my own soil base. The best mixture I've ever used personally was it's a
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:48.820]  product called Malibu compost. It's a biodynamic compost blend. It's fucking
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:52.260]  awesome. It's only available in California. It's really hard to get here.
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:56.860]  I was fortunate enough to come across a couple of bags and it was probably some
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:00.620]  of the best product they use. But it's a compost. It's not a soil mix. Who's in
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.820]  California that can send us a couple of bags of that? Somebody hook me up please.
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.460]  Yeah, we need that. Malibu compost. I'll give you my PO box number. Just hook me
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:11.220]  up. Yeah, but it's a biodynamic blend. So they have like yarrow and nettle and
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:17.060]  dandelions and all sorts of cool stuff mixed in there. But so I used so I'll
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:23.180]  use a compost and then cut it in with perlite. I'm not sorry. I use a compost
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:28.940]  and then I cut it in with worm castings. So I make my own like vermicompost. So
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:35.380]  I'll use the yeah the Malibu's compost Rocky Mount worm castings and then I'll
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:42.260]  add in an aerator which is typically a lot of people use perlite. I don't like
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:48.780]  perlite so much. So I use diatomite because I've got a huge bag of it I've
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.900]  had for like years. I'm still working through it but you can use like pumice
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:58.540]  or lava rock. I like to recommend people use things that don't go away as fast.
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:04.740]  You know perlite floats to the top and it grinds up really fine and it just
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:10.460]  kind of goes away to nothing. But I always recommend people to do like a 50%
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.420]  like lava rock or pumice or diatomite something that doesn't break down as
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:19.220]  quick and then do another 50 like the other half do like a rice hole or buckwheat
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:25.540]  hole. Okay. Or some more of a carbon based aerator. All right. So yeah we put
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:30.100]  in our aerator and then after your compost in your aerator then you make
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:34.060]  the decision of whether or not you're gonna want to use coca-cola or peat moss.
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:40.420]  I like peat moss but I like the environment too. And so you kind of got
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:43.980]  it. It all comes from like one swamp in Canada or something. Yeah you know so you
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:48.060]  got it like I said organics it seems like it's always awesome but it's not
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:51.620]  always the best. You just kind of got to pick what you want. I've actually found
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:56.860]  best result. I like mixture of cocoa and peat moss. There's something about the
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:00.100]  oils that come from the cocoa fibers that the plant really likes. Yeah I've
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:04.260]  really like a mix of I've been playing around. I'm gonna take a nap so you better keep
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:08.900]  talking. No you're good. Yeah I've been playing around with different ratios 50-50
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:17.020]  75-25 of cocoa to peat moss but I kind of like a half and half mixture with it.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:22.940]  And then outside of that we'll go in and then add kelp meal crustacean, neem,
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:28.940]  oyster shell powder, glacial rock dust, ginseng. If we really want to get into it
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:33.620]  we'll add you know biochar and bucashi and a lot of other natural farming inputs.
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:38.940]  But that's personally for like my home grow. I can get into it with that stuff.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:43.460]  But you guys can too. Listen to this episode hit pause and rewind all that
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:46.700]  stuff and listen back and make a list. And if you can't afford to buy a bunch
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:50.500]  of shit buy the first two. Yeah and the next time buy the buy three of them and
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:54.020]  then you'll make a better soil every every time. And we'll start you'll start
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.940]  seeing good you should get great results right off the bat. And I tell you if you
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:01.820]  think if you if you play it back and you think it's too overwhelming I do
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:06.380]  work with the dispensaries a lot. You know I run a consultation company so if
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:10.620]  any of you guys out there know anybody who I hate the word con I hate saying
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:14.300]  I'm gonna do consultations but if anybody out there wants to switch you
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.740]  know any facilities that want to switch we're all licensed over here natural
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:21.940]  farming and you know we've got our cards we can go in and help your favorite grow
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:26.820]  convert to organics. But I work with a couple of different shops and they
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.460]  always seem a little overwhelmed when I come in there and I started running my
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.300]  mouth about mixing soils and you're gonna get this and this and this and
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:37.860]  you're gonna mix it together and it's overwhelming. They like that when you can
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:41.780]  walk in there and you can be like yep buy a pallet of this and I want a pallet
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:46.620]  of that. So I've actually got a mixture for everybody out there who wants to go
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:50.980]  and just buy a pallet of soil or you want to go buy a bale of Pro Mix or some
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:57.900]  Sunshine 4. So just go and grab your Sunshine 4 or your Pro Mix. I recommend
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:04.780]  cutting in worm castings 10% for your microbial source. Then I would just add
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:08.260]  and depending on what you're going with so if you go with like a Sunshine 4
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:13.340]  Advanced they've got like a nutrient starter pack which is I think there's
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:18.220]  some like minerals in there other things like that yeah and that one's a really
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:25.340]  good one to go with and then just add in your worm castings, kelp meal, neem
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:30.580]  cake and crustacean milk or oyster shell powder just kind of dependent on how you
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:35.180]  want to grow personally. But that's it. That's a good start right there.
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:40.500]  And I've tried them out like right now if you go to the king underscore cola
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:46.660]  feed on Instagram you can look at the there's pictures of worms just all over
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.620]  the containers you know top soils moving and that's actually all done in
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:56.700]  Sunshine 4 with kelp, neem, crustacean and oyster shell powder. Really simple.
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:01.620]  I mean I feel like I'm getting some of the best results that I've ever had with
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:06.260]  this super the between this mix and then the mix I had mentioned earlier with
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:10.300]  Malibu compost are probably the two best results I've gotten since I've started.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:17.420]  It's so hard to source a solid like place to get compost so if you can't do
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:23.020]  that and you can't make your own compost I mean there's no shame in going and
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:27.180]  buying a bag of soil. You know what I mean? Like everybody I don't know.
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:32.060]  You can always start a Bokashi bucket. That's a great way to make some over the past three or
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.900]  four weeks I don't know how long I've been talking about the Bokashi bucket
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:41.100]  but I see it turning into funk inside that bucket and I will have that's a
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.700]  five gallon bucket essentially I'll have five gallons of compost to add to a
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:48.260]  whole bunch of dirt and then in a month or two I will have my own amazing
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:53.740]  compost pile started from that. Exactly and I mean even like even buying soil
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:08:00.580]  from the store using the nicest castings that money can buy like Rocky Mile Worm
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:07.620]  castings and it's still crazy and then after amending the soil it's amazing how
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:11.340]  cheap this stuff comes out. I'm not gonna say the name of this shop that I'm
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:17.940]  working for but I will say that they're running 480 20 gallons and we priced
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:24.140]  them out at a dollar 20 per gallon of soil. Wow that's amazing. So suck on that
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:29.700]  one synthetics. There you go guys and that's for a dispensary so they have to
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:34.180]  rely on quality products. I'm gonna do a quick commercial I hate to sneak in a
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:37.780]  commercial but I have to do them and this is a great time because a lot of
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:41.100]  what we're talking about the organic portion this portions I'm gonna try this
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.580]  commercial again the organic portions of this episode were sponsored by my

[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.620]  what else you got on making your own soil or do you want to talk about
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:07.620]  something different? No I think that that's a this is a good point to go back
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:11.220]  to high grow. I do want to mention because I feel like we've been talking I
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:16.380]  don't want to snub the other people. We're talking about a no I mean because
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:19.700]  I was telling people to go and grab soil mix you know go yeah yeah yeah I
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:26.060]  want to we'll work with Jesse a little bit and we'll try to get we'll call it a
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:29.180]  Rocky Mountain Natural Farming mix up there for you at the store because I mean
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:32.060]  they already carry in the soil they've already got the castings up there they've
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:38.180]  got Krokashi up there. Yeah you talk to Jesse we can get you fixed with the
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:42.940]  Rocky Mountain Natural Farming mix which is like I said it's I mean Pro Mix
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:49.100]  Sunshine 4, kelp, crustacean, neem, get to rocking. We'll try to get hey guys at
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:53.540]  Hygro here's my idea I want you to set up one little section just a shelf that
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:57.860]  we can just walk right there and get this stuff like it'll be the grow from
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:00.540]  your heart Rocky Mountain worm castings Hygro
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.300]  indoor growing supplies little bonus section and just go right there there'll
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:08.380]  be some Krokashi there. We'll do the same thing up at the shop for you too. That'd be so
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:11.540]  awesome let's do this guys that's my proposal to you guys. Yeah I'd appreciate
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:15.940]  it. So go if you can't if you can't source compost and all of that jazz then
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:22.460]  go to your local hydro store Hygro and grab your bag soil get you some basic
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:28.340]  amendments and the the trick is is to figure out what works for you. I don't
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:34.220]  like this like one size fits all idea of growing because it doesn't you know I
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:38.060]  mean you probably water completely differently. I bet. I bet completely
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:43.020]  differently. If I used your soil mixing methods I would probably slaughter those
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:47.980]  plants I guarantee I'd kill every single one of them and then you do the same
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:51.860]  thing in my style does that mean that you're a better grower than me or vice
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:56.860]  versa no it doesn't. Exactly. It's just a matter of you've got to dial it in you
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:02.020]  know I would recommend starting out with a Pro Mix or a Sunshine 4 once you get a
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:06.820]  grower two down with that and you're really basic soil amendments then all
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:11.140]  Sunshine 4 and Pro Mix is is peat moss and an aerator and you know so yeah
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:15.180]  source those products. That's actually what my last run was done in was Sunshine 4 Pro Mix.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:19.940]  Yeah and you know so yeah I think people get overwhelmed when you start talking
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:23.020]  about the conversion to organics but if they only knew how close they already
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:27.340]  were you know so many synthetic growers are using Sunshine 4 and they're using
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:31.620]  Pro Mix it's like well next time you do that just add in a microbial source like
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:36.300]  earthworm castings add in some kelp meal you know to help prevent against you
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:41.460]  know fungus gnats and white flies and spider mites add in some neem cake or
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:47.540]  crustacean meal yeah I mean. Easy stuff like that right you're mixing soil
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:50.780]  anyway you should be yeah you shouldn't I don't think you should open the bag
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:53.300]  and just start pulling out of the bag you should dump it into something kind
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:58.020]  of spread it out. I was surprised to learn that like I said I've
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:02.740]  always grown organically so I was I see a lot of the commercial synthetic
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:06.020]  growers and kind of how they're doing stuff and I was really surprised to see
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:09.060]  even they had been the shit out of their soil I mean they're growing you
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:13.460]  know in Pro Mix and they're still running.
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:18.020]  Yeah I mean that was something we were trying to talk to a friend about last
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.980]  night is finding that balance between the worm castings and the advanced
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.620]  nutrients he's like can I do this and we're trying to tell him gently that
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:27.380]  your advanced is just gonna kill all that stuff bro throw away those advanced
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:32.300]  bottles. Yeah you know if you're want to make the if you want to make the switch
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.940]  then you need to not get advanced nutrients go get something like a
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:41.820]  general organics or roots organics or biobiz. And even botanic air is not as
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:46.100]  organic as they try to advertise. It's far from it. Yeah I mean even if you were to go
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:52.820]  age old is a really old-school product it really is so cheap and I know so many
[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:57.060]  people who crush it with age old. I've got a friend who grows nothing but
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:01.220]  iRegenetics with nothing but age old. And it's so cheap I mean you want to talk
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:05.580]  about low cost of production who cares if I mean you know you'll yield good but
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:09.220]  even if you didn't it's so fucking cheap you're only paying for power. Right yeah
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:13.940]  that's the truth. Yeah it's the beauty of organics. Organics I'm making the switch
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:17.700]  and I love it I've really seen a difference in my plants they perform
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:21.540]  better they don't seem and I dude I've been growing cannabis for a long time
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.340]  the plants always seemed like they were thriving to me and now that I'm using
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:27.860]  the organics I can see that I was missing something. They look they're just
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:32.020]  look they're waxier they don't have they have more the cuticles on the leaves are
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:37.540]  thicker the stems are more robust and I was feeding I've fed all the commercial
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:40.500]  brands of nutrients before and I'm definitely noticing a difference with
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:43.860]  just basic and just small jumps to organics it's not even anything major.
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:51.220]  Well you tell me you since you come from the synthetic world is it easier? I hear
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:56.580]  a lot of people tell me it's more complicated but I am NOT the most I mean
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:02.260]  I do a lot of other stuff I'm not in my growth like I used to be and my my
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:06.900]  plants are fine. The way I think this seems to make more sense to me than
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:10.500]  mixing up bottles like a scientist yeah and I've read all of my bottles anyway
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.620]  so I know what that's coming from like I know that that's chicken shit and
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:17.460]  seabird guano why don't I just use chicken shit and seabird guano yeah like
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:21.300]  and I think I didn't trust myself to make those mixtures I thought I'd burn
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:25.220]  something or whatever but there are so many guides between you the Rev and
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:29.140]  and every forum on the internet I can find the correct mixture for everything
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:32.500]  and this podcast now this is a good reference. Your plants are going to be way more
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:36.900]  forgiving to you putting the guano on it than to you putting a bottled nutrient
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:41.940]  that's got guano in it on it. True, very true that's more concentrated and I can
[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:45.780]  definitely add too much of that way easily. Exactly. Yeah I don't even like
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:49.380]  using guano I'm gonna stay away from any kind of shit in my plants. Guano is
[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:54.580]  actually extremely unsustainable to harvest and then it's really bad for you
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:58.420]  to breathe in but I know a lot of people are die hard about it yeah and
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:05.220]  personally I think it like produces some really awesome outdoor. Jesse will swear
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:09.460]  by it for the outdoor growers. Jesse would come chop us down right now for saying
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:13.540]  bad things about us drinking guano. Yeah the guano is pretty banging for outdoor
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:19.020]  not you know there's other options but hey right to each his own. And if we're
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:22.500]  dissing your growing methods I'm sorry we're not dissing it we're just trying
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:26.660]  to encourage you to do more sustainable healthier things. Do what you want, do
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:29.140]  what you want. You're gonna get it if you if you're okay with it go for it.
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:34.100]  Yeah I don't want to eat meat you know what I mean I don't eat GMO foods. I
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:38.580]  live my life I have a certain lifestyle that I try to live by and I incorporate
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:42.980]  that all the way into the medicine and the plants that I grow so you know I
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:46.340]  don't force I hang out with people who eat meat, I hang out with people who grow
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.700]  synthetics like it's no big deal. Right. Like to each his own you don't have to I
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:55.860]  really I get attacked a lot on Instagram and a lot of these like other places when
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.660]  I feel like when I try to put information out there I feel like I get
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:03.460]  met with a lot of resistance but I'm not telling people I'm not trying to tell
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:08.980]  people how to do things I'm just trying to give it put information out there so
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:14.260]  please don't argue with me. If you like it take it in you know if you don't
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:18.700]  unfollow me. Yeah follow someone else there's plenty of other Instagram pages
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:23.740]  to troll. You know you can hit those. Yeah you know but that being said if you
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:27.020]  if you ever have questions and you're serious and you want to know something
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:32.780]  just direct message me email me email Jeff. Yeah I got your back. We'll get
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:37.900]  the you know we'll get you the knowledge you need. Yeah we know we've got
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:41.020]  resources for all kinds of knowledge it was funny because we were at a growers
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:44.060]  meeting last night and Shana and I were both stumped on something and people
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.180]  looked at us like well what the fuck if you guys don't know then what is the
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:51.740]  answer? They're like sorry guys there's some shit we're not gonna know. I've never seen
[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:54.980]  that so I don't know give me three days to research it we'll find out but right
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:59.100]  now you might have to call Jim Ferrer. Yeah but I feel like people have this
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:04.460]  like they've got this idea that we can just look at one picture on your phone
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:08.420]  or you're gonna send me a one direct message and I'm gonna know what you fed
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:13.700]  him for the past three weeks. Yeah we'll try yeah we'll try but sometimes yeah
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.020]  that one last night was a weird challenge I don't know what it was it was
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:23.100]  powdery something mildewish looking stuff. Yeah unfortunately that was a case of all too it's all
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:26.140]  too familiar I like I knew him personally I was actually working with
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:29.500]  him on that before the meeting he was introduced to me through a friend of
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:33.940]  mine but yeah I thought it was powdery mildew originally and then we thought it
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:38.740]  was a pH problem and they thought it was newt law and it's all too familiar of a
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:43.700]  problem he actually you know wasn't too familiar with growing went to the local
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.740]  hydro store not high grow because if you you know Jesse would have helped him the
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:51.660]  guy would have been killing it but he goes to these horrible competitors here
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:57.060]  in town and they set him up on what he thinks is cocoa they give him a cocoa
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:04.780]  nutrient he's running it turns out it's peat moss and you know so it happens and
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:09.140]  he's embarrassed and it's not his fault. No, it shouldn't happen to me. Don't be embarrassed you guys.
[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:13.560]  The guy's awesome and he's learned so much and he's his plants are still alive even
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.720]  after all of that you know like I mean we saw fucked up pictures of them but
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.920]  hey they're still kicking yeah if he makes it to harvest that's what counts
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:25.680]  you know but perseverance you know you just got to keep stay committed to it
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.440]  don't if you think that I grow beautiful plants every time you're out of your
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.960]  mind oh man I just don't put pictures of the ugly ones on Instagram. There's plenty of ugly shit that I've done.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:38.840]  I'll admit it one time I had and this was years ago the first time it was the
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.840]  first time I said I was in a new house growing in a brand new basement in the
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.960]  middle of winter and I'd never grown in there before and you got a dial in a
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.080]  room but I had a white rhino plant in a seven gallon pot that probably weighed
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:53.120]  between five and six ounces and I went to cut it down and I noticed powdery
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:57.800]  mildew all up the one side that was near the exterior wall corner so that wall
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:01.600]  was colder than the whole rest of the room and it got powdery mildew. It was
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.720]  ugly as shit. My buddy Mike was there helping me trim and I said hey Mike
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.280]  watch this and I chopped the plant and usually he's got a hand on it when I cut
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:11.040]  it so that it doesn't timber you know and I just cut that son of a bitch right
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.280]  to the ground just timber and it hit the floor and he looked at me like what
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.640]  the hell man and I was like there's powdery mildew on it we're throwing the
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.440]  whole plant away. It happens I mean people ask me all the time how do you
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:24.880]  know if it works that's how thousands and thousands of dollars worth of just
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:29.240]  R&D. But if you're gonna try something crazy try it on one plant if you have
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.640]  the option. Don't do something ridiculous. Don't defoliate. I've been trying
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.120]  extreme defoliation on one plant I won't do it to more than one. I see a
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.400]  difference and I like it honestly guys I doubted it in the beginning but I like
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:46.040]  it. And I learned this the hard way in every scientific experiment for God's
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:51.240]  sake make sure you have a control and maybe take some notes. Exactly. We're high
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.640]  and we forget a lot of shit. Yeah cuz you don't want to run a six-month trial.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:59.400]  Take pictures if you can. Post them on Instagram and it'll stay there stay
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:03.080]  there so you have notes. We should go for about five more minutes guys the last
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.360]  episode was short and you listened to every minute of it I can see the stats I
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.240]  can tell how long you listen. Holy crap thanks for listening to the whole thing
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.520]  that was cool I appreciate that I hope you liked that solo episode. It's hard to
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:16.680]  do solo shows. I feel like we covered do the molasses thing is gonna be the
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:20.320]  groundbreaker for the episode I like that. We covered soil pretty well do you
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:25.920]  have any wrap-up notes for soil? Keep it simple. There you go keep it simple
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.800]  Stoner. That's what I would say. That's all I gotta say. All right dude huge thanks for
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:34.560]  coming. Thanks for having me. You gave it a hug after like 45 minutes before we even recorded which is awesome.
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:37.160]  It's so awesome people like how long does it take and I'm like allow two or
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:41.520]  three hours when you get here because we like to dab and bullshit. Today is a
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.160]  special day you guys I might get tarry-eyed for this I had to save it to
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.320]  the end. Happy birthday Jenny Kush we love you. Today this episode is being
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:52.080]  recorded on the on Jenny Kush's birthday she'd be 36. I can't talk too much about
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.560]  it because it'll make me cry. Happy birthday Jenny we love you we miss you
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.120]  wish you we wish you were still here with us. Guys Jenny Google Jenny Kush if

[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:25.040]  with those guys. I'm taking the recording equipment up to Colorado Springs gonna
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.800]  go hang out at the Terpy boy house and hit the mothership. What up guys I
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:32.960]  cannot wait to come. I've been talking about Golden Goat and Lemon Jeffery
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:37.400]  seeds they're right on schedule so I'm saying like 85 80 days from now we
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:41.480]  should have some new seeds ready. On the next episode I'm gonna talk to Spence
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.520]  not the I think the next episode I'm gonna talk to Spence about fucking
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:50.000]  rosin dude. Rosin you guys see it? Rosin tech. What the fuck bro big shout out to
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.120]  Soil Grown and the rosin thing man. I've actually turned some food I had a whole
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:24:00.640]  bunch of food grade cooking grade or whatever you want to call it from my last
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:06.080]  wash my last harvest. I mean jars full of it sitting in my cupboard. But yeah shout out to Soil Grown.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:11.400]  If you guys are on Instagram check out at Soil Grown on Instagram that
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.800]  dude is killing it with some new things called rosin tech. If you guys are gonna
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.280]  try making rosin tech don't burn yourselves that's all I've got to say
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.040]  because that's gonna hurt. We're gonna start seeing we've seen rosin tech
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.000]  happen and then we've seen people follow suit and now I'm waiting for the rosin
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.080]  tech burns. That's what's gonna be next. Also if you're on Instagram check out
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:30.520]  Dragonflight Earth Medicine. Holy shit you learn a lot of great things.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:33.480]  Something I want to talk about more in the future is the Bokashi bucket. It's
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:37.000]  something I'm experimenting with right now. Great results. Cannot believe I
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.240]  didn't do this earlier. Thanks a lot to Rocky Mountain Worm Company and Sean for
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.800]  hooking me up with that. That's really cool. No problem. Game changer dude. I
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.240]  added the the liquid that came out of there to my worm tea and it's the best
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:50.400]  worm tea I've ever made and I saw results within 24 hours on my plants.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.160]  And then everybody out there check out the Bokashi bucket on Instagram. Yeah.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:59.840]  They actually have their own page. They're a super awesome group of guys
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:05.520]  down in Hawaii. I've had the pleasure of meeting them. I actually I gave one of
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.920]  the guys one of their first dabs here and it was actually at the Emerald Cup
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:13.960]  but I was dabbing him out on some full melt. Yeah. But a shout out to the Bokashi
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:19.480]  bucket guys. They're great guys. I think you can pick up the buckets if your hydro shop or
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.760]  your if the Rocky Mountain Worm Company does have them but if you're not near us
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:27.680]  you can get them. The Bokashi bucket guys have a website or also Whole Foods
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.400]  sells them. So if there's a Whole Foods in your area go check out the chicks in the
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:37.080]  yoga pants and Ugg boots and pick yourself up a Bokashi bucket. Yeah. Let's
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.880]  wrap up the show. I don't think there's much left to say tonight. We've done a
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:43.200]  lot of work. People have probably took four pages of notes because I took a
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.720]  page and a half myself. I hope you guys wrote all that down. Shout out to Hippy
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.280]  Nurse. I know you write down a bunch of notes. I hope you went through seven or
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.720]  eight pages on this episode. She really listens. That's awesome. Yeah. I just talk
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:58.440]  so I'm glad somebody's listening. You had notes too man so I'm glad you came prepared. Thanks again for coming dude.

[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:41.020]  music here. It's a little loud in my ear. I'm gonna turn that down and let's go to
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:46.980]  iTunes and let's read an iTunes comment. Here it is. This comment is from White
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:51.900]  Trike. The comment is, this show is great keep it up. Well thanks a lot for the
[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:55.540]  comment White Trike. I appreciate that. I like hearing that the show is great and
[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:59.700]  I like the encouragement so I definitely definitely will keep it up. Thanks for
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:02.180]  that comment. Thanks to everybody that's left a comment in the past. Let's go to
[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:06.060]  Twitter. I've actually got a couple of Twitter comments I want to read. I feel
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:09.900]  like I'm doing a Doug Benson stand-up comedy show because Doug Benson
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:12.660]  just stands there and reads tweets the whole time and that's kind of what I'm
[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:15.820]  doing to you guys. But I like supporting the listeners. There wouldn't be a
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:18.980]  podcast if there weren't listeners. It'd just be me talking into a mic for no
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:23.420]  reason. So I appreciate you guys a lot. Scrolling through looking for this
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:27.820]  notification here. Where is it? Mr. Omnio. He says, sitting in the garden in the sun
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:30.980]  while listening to Ross DeGeff on the Grow From Your Heart podcast explain
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:36.260]  worm castings, benefits, and seed genetics. Hashtag good life. Mr. Omnio dude thanks
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:39.060]  for listening to me while you're gardening. That's what I'm hoping for. I
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:42.340]  hope you guys are in the garden learning stuff while you're playing with the
[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:46.900]  plants. Maybe you're on the drive to or from work. Maybe you're at work. Hopefully
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:51.180]  I'm in your ear entertaining you and teaching you something about cannabis.
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:57.220]  Also let's see. Adrian Gee, the amazing Adrian. He said, at Grow From Your Heart, it could be a
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:00.580]  he or a she. Let me check on your stuff here. I don't want to call you he if
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:04.780]  you're a female. I'm sorry. Adrian is kind of a unisex name. No that is a dude in
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:10.540]  that picture. It's definitely a dude. So he, Adrian, says, now I got to go back to
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:14.780]  your comment. Here we go. At Grow From Your Heart podcast. Just started listening to
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:18.900]  your podcast. It's great. Lots of good info. And of course I replied. I said
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:22.020]  thanks for listening on Twitter. Dude thanks for listening to the show. That's
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:24.780]  what I'm here for. I'm trying to teach you guys. Trying to educate a little bit.
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:28.940]  Trying to move cannabis forward. I think if we talk more positively about this
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:32.460]  plant, people will be less afraid. That's all we got to do is open the door to
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:36.340]  talk about it. So again, big thanks and big shout out to White Trike for the
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:40.580]  iTunes comment there. If you leave a comment on iTunes or Stitcher, I will
[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:43.300]  read it on the show you guys. And if you don't want to leave a comment on iTunes
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:48.340]  or Stitcher, send me a tweet. It's at GFYH podcast. Or find me on Facebook and I'll
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:51.780]  respond to you there. If you want to say something anonymously, you can send me a
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:55.020]  personal or private message and I will keep your name private. You can also
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:59.500]  email me. It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com. I know that's a lot of
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:03.180]  contact information, but if you want to be in touch, I'd love to hear from you.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:08.140]  So I said at the beginning of the show that I had a bunch of news and stuff to
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:12.900]  talk about. So let's click on some stuff. Here we go. Clicking away. Click, click,
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:17.300]  click. And I'm finding the first news article. The first news article is... it
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:20.740]  kind of hits home here because I actually am a medical marijuana caregiver.
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:26.460]  The way you become a caregiver, all you really have to do is have... so I'm a...
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.340]  there's a patient. There's... that's what we call the person that smokes a
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:33.100]  medical marijuana. There's a patient. That person goes to the doctor. They get
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:36.580]  their medical marijuana recommendation. And then when you send that into the
[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:42.620]  state of Colorado, you can assign a caregiver. And that's where my name goes
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:46.020]  onto that paper. My name and my address and a copy of my ID gets sent to the
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:49.820]  state and I become a caregiver. Which means I am now responsible for growing
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:55.340]  medical cannabis for my friend who signed me up. And there is a limit of
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:59.060]  five people that you're allowed to be a caregiver for. So you can be... you can
[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:03.180]  have yourself plus five other people and you can grow cannabis for them.
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:08.020]  That's kind of how it was. And before you were allowed to have six plants per
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:12.500]  person. But then there are doctors that are willing to write you an extended
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:18.420]  plant count. So if you say, my back hurts a lot or I've got fibromyalgia and I
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:22.140]  don't smoke cannabis. I actually make oils out of all of this and I need a lot
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:25.540]  more plants. The doctors will be a little compassionate and they will write you
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:29.100]  what's called an extended plant count. And sometimes that costs you more money.
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:33.020]  But in the long run that's worth it because you need your medicine. And that
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:38.860]  just allows you to grow more plants and possess more cannabis. So the state has
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:43.260]  kind of caught on that some people are going to the doctor and there are
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:47.380]  some doctors in Colorado that it just costs money. If you want the original six
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:51.620]  plants, it's cheap. You go in there and pay a cheap like $45-$50 visit. If you
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:57.340]  want 12 plants, they double it. If you want 25 plants, they pretty much
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:36:01.620]  quadruple your price. If you're wanting 50 plants, you're paying five times what
[01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:05.580]  you did before. There are some doctors that will write a 99 plant
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:11.940]  recommendation for $500 flat. So you can grow 99 plants in your house for $500
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:16.140]  for one year. That's how it was. But now they're making all kinds of rules
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:19.700]  because they have seen that. What happens is a lot of people sign up for 99 plants
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:24.700]  and if you grow 99 seven gallon pots, hopefully you're pulling a whole bunch
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:28.540]  of weight and then that's hitting the black market. And they're kind of aware
[01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:30.980]  of that and they don't want that happening in the state of Colorado
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:34.660]  anymore. They're really trying to crack down and tax every gram of pot that's
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:37.460]  produced. I'm gonna take a sip here and then I'll read you this news article I've
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:44.980]  got. I've got some yerba mate here. It's nice and hot. Gotta be careful with that.
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:50.020]  Alright. So this news article comes from a website called The Cannabis.
[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:54.780]  Shout out to The Cannabis. I pull a lot of news articles from this site. This was
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:58.260]  actually published February 26th so I'm a little bit behind but this is still
[01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:02.660]  relevant. The article was by Joey Bunch of the Denver Post. The headline is
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:08.540]  Colorado MMJ caregiver bill clears Senate Committee. The article says a
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:11.740]  state Senate committee on Thursday unanimously approved a bill that would
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:15.940]  require medical marijuana caregivers to register and allow state agencies to
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:19.900]  share enough information to ensure pot grown for medicine isn't sold illegally.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:24.500]  While pot sold for recreational use has been subject to a battery of tests and
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:27.980]  regulations since it became legal last year, medical marijuana has gone
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:32.100]  relatively unregulated requiring only that caregivers be at least 18 years old
[01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:36.340]  and have some significant responsibility for the care of a licensed medical
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:40.580]  marijuana user. There's actually a spot on the application that asks what
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:46.300]  services you provide for your patient. I write spiritual counseling. I write that
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:49.580]  I drive them to and from their doctor's appointments because a lot of that is
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:54.900]  true. I prepare meals for some of my patients. Um, yeah, they asked for what
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:58.820]  you do. And so you got to fill that in. And actually they have, they denied one
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:01.660]  of my caregiver requests. I had to refill out the paper and put better
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:04.960]  reasoning because they did not like my reasons why I was part of their
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:09.220]  significant responsibility. So they are paying a little bit of attention. I'll
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:13.020]  get back to the article. It says the regulatory bill was characterized by
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:16.460]  the state agency and law enforcement officials as a benefit to caregivers
[01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:20.720]  because those registered would not have to face arrest or cost or a costly
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.100]  legal proceedings if they're registered with the state. The bill is supported by
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:28.500]  the colorado cannabis chamber of commerce. The medical marijuana
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:31.980]  supporters testified they were concerned about costs from regulations, patient
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:37.360]  privacy and the risks risks of untested medical marijuana. This bill is really
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:40.300]  about assessing law enforcement, but it's doing so at the expense of the
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:44.380]  rights of patients and caregivers said colorado marijuana activist robert
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:49.780]  chase who opposed the legislation legislation. I'm sorry. In 2009 when the
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:53.700]  U. S. Attorney General's office advised federal agents not to intervene in cases
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:57.580]  that are compliant with state laws, medical marijuana license have exploded
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:04.180]  in colorado in 2008 there were 4819 licensed medical marijuana patients in
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:11.380]  colorado said Senator Irene Aguilar. As of last december there were 115,467
[01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:15.660]  license loser users said Aguilar the bill Senate sponsor. But to keep
[01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:19.700]  federal regulators out of colorado's pot business, the state must regulate it
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:23.620]  adequately. She said the federal expectation is that states that have
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:27.680]  allowed marijuana to be legal and local governments will be implementing strong
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:30.700]  and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will protect
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:35.180]  public safety, public health and law enforcement interests. She said while
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:39.780]  the average age of colorado medical marijuana user is 42 years old, the
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:43.300]  number of Children has increased in the past two years on indications pot helps
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:48.700]  Children with seizures and other illnesses. In March 2013 colorado had 35
[01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:52.620]  patients younger than 18 by last december. The number of minors had
[01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:58.360]  grown to 462. Aguilar said Sierra Riddle of colorado Springs said she moved from
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:04.340]  Utah in 2013 because her son has cancer and needs medical marijuana. Um big
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:06.580]  shout out the team land and what's up. I didn't even know Sierra was going to
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:09.980]  be mentioned in this article. Those are people that we support in colorado
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:13.980]  Springs. So support team landon and Sierra Riddle if you can. Big shout out
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:16.860]  the amount of Children that are increasing on the medical marijuana
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:20.020]  registry needs to be considered because it's only going to increase more. She
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:24.180]  said these rules and laws need to be put in place to protect our Children to
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:28.960]  protect their plant count and to protect our rights to grow their plants. Now
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:32.780]  this article kind of hits home because I'm a caregiver myself and the local
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:37.460]  rules are changing here to where we are. We're being reduced on the number
[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:41.580]  of patients we are allowed to have which will also reduce the number of plants
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:45.820]  we are allowed to have and they have also reduced the amount of space we are
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:50.380]  allowed to use. So that means the five people that I'm responsible for
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:54.980]  providing medical marijuana to somebody is going to have to find somebody else
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.820]  to grow their medicine for them and the state doesn't give a shit that I've
[01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:04.620]  been responsible for them for the past seven or eight years. It has been my
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:09.140]  responsibility and my duty to take care of these people. I have established a
[01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:12.720]  relationship with them and I have a significant role in caring for these
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:16.340]  people but the state does not care. They need to end that and find a new
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:20.140]  caregiver to grow their medical cannabis for them. I think that's
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:23.580]  bullshit because I know these people, I know what strains they like. I have
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:27.860]  bred strains for my patients. Yes, that's what I do. I have people that
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:31.780]  smoke medical cannabis and I will breed strains for them. The night nurse was
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:37.020]  inspired by my friend Doug. He's an older cat and his body hurts and he has a hard
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:41.140]  time sleeping. When he smoked the Tora Bora he said holy shit and when he smoked
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:45.460]  the Grateful Dog he said holy shit. Those were two of his favorite strains ever. So
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:49.940]  I felt like it was my job to make a hybrid of the two and then find the
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:54.180]  right phenotype that worked for Doug and when I grew those he loved it and now
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:57.700]  guess what? Sorry Doug, I don't get to be your caregiver anymore because the
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:00.340]  state doesn't give a shit about our bona fide relationship that we've
[01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:04.820]  developed over years. Not really Doug, I'm keeping you but that's my example.
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:08.620]  And Team Landon, there are little kids out there with brain tumors, cancers,
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:13.860]  seizures, lymphoma. Kids have all kinds of bad things that adults have and now we
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:18.420]  need to let these kids have their caregivers have plant counts. This is
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:22.660]  messed up. This is why I'm fired up because this is what medical, this is
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:25.740]  what started the cannabis movement in Colorado was medical cannabis and
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:29.860]  caregivers. Caregivers are what started it. The patients and the caregivers are
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:33.380]  ground zero and now guess who's being screwed right out of this deal? The
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:37.300]  patients and the caregivers because they want us to be forced to shop at
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:41.740]  recreational dispensaries where taxes are fucking ridiculous and we cannot
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:44.580]  afford it. How are we gonna medicate ourselves that way? The reason we are
[01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:47.340]  medicating ourselves with cannabis is so that we don't have to jump through
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:50.100]  somebody else's hoops so that we don't have to go stand in line to pay
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:55.260]  ridiculous prices for medicine. You're fucking us over guys. Sorry, end of rant.
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:59.300]  I'm passionate about this. It pisses me off because the patients that started
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:03.220]  medical cannabis are now the people that nobody, I can't say nobody, the people
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:07.260]  that most of this industry is looking over right now. We've forgotten them. It's
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:10.060]  all about the patient. Patients first. Without the patients there would have been no
[01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:13.300]  medical marijuana movement. There would not have been caregivers. There would have
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:16.700]  not been homegrows and we would not have gotten as far as we've gotten today. We'd
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:20.940]  be years behind if we did not start this with medical marijuana. Alright, so think
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:24.980]  about the patients you guys. I'm gonna do the best I can. I'm gonna have to register
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:29.300]  my grows with my city and with my state. They're going to come to my private grow
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:32.340]  and they're going to look through my grows and make sure that I'm following
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:35.960]  all of the laws and that everything is done up to code. I'm gonna sign up to do
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:39.500]  that because I'm well known around here and if I don't do it I know they will
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:43.860]  come here and they will try to press some kind of legal charges on me. There
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:47.900]  are paperwork, papers that I can fill out to have an excuse or an exception to have
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:54.100]  more patients but I don't see, I'm gonna really have to pull a lot of reasons
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:57.380]  out of the air because they're paperwork, they don't have any compassion,
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:43:59.980]  they have check marks. You know what I mean? Does this, this and this happen?
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:03.580]  Then no and it's just like talking to a computer instead of a person with
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:07.260]  compassion. It sucks. Alright, that's enough on that article. Give me a second.
[01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:11.020]  Alright guys, I'm back. I took a couple dabs. I calmed down. I'm not so pissed off
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:14.660]  about that last article anymore but we have a whole new article coming up and
[01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:18.700]  this could do a lot of things to us. The sub headline is another
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:23.300]  lawsuit has been filed in federal court over Colorado's marijuana legalization
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:28.820]  amendment. The headline is new lawsuit sheriffs from Colorado and elsewhere
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:33.780]  challenge amendment 64. What makes the new suit unique is that it is also
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:39.180]  asking for a federal judge to overturn amendment 64's protections for marijuana
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:44.580]  use and possession. This article is written by Kirk Mitchell and John
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:47.740]  Engle of the Denver Post. Let's get right into it.
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:51.780]  Six Colorado sheriffs sued their own governor in federal court on Thursday
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:55.140]  arguing that state laws legalizing marijuana require them to violate
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:59.540]  federal law. Joining the sheriffs in the lawsuit, the fourth to be filed against
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:03.220]  Colorado over marijuana legalization are the sheriffs and prosecutors from
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:07.740]  Nebraska and Kansas. The suit argues that federal law supremacy means Colorado
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:12.020]  cannot allow people to possess or use marijuana for recreational purposes and
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:16.100]  it cannot license stores to sell it. The law does not challenge Colorado's
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:20.620]  medical marijuana laws or stores. The suit is about one thing, the rule of the
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:25.300]  law. Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said in a news release, release I
[01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:29.740]  said released, geez, the Colorado Constitution mandates that all elected
[01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:34.660]  officials including sheriffs swear an oath of office to uphold both the United
[01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:38.860]  States as well as the Colorado Constitution. The suit names Governor
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:43.460]  John Hickenlooper as the lone defendant. Colorado's Attorney General Cynthia
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:47.780]  Kaufman will defend the state against the lawsuit, a spokesman for her said.
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:52.300]  The lawsuit, excuse me, the lawsuit has the backing of national anti-legalization
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:56.740]  groups and its nationwide ambitions were apparent in the choice of where to
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:46:00.460]  announce the suit. In a news conference Thursday morning at the National Press
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:04.260]  Club in Washington DC, Smith told reporters that Colorado's passage of
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:08.980]  Amendment 64 created a constitutional shutdown in the state. The amendment
[01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:13.780]  which voters approved in 2012 made it legal for people over 21 in Colorado to
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:18.220]  possess limited amounts of marijuana and for licensed stores to sell marijuana.
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:24.060]  Cannabis. We think that Colorado, we think that what Colorado has done is illegal. We
[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:29.420]  think it's unconstitutional. Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska Sheriff Mark Overman, who
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:33.460]  is also a plaintiff in the suit, said at the news conference, I believe my fellow
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:37.020]  plaintiffs believe that this case is going to have national ramifications and
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:41.580]  if we win then we can reverse what looks like a surrender to a pro-marijuana
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:46.620]  crowd. The lawsuit follows another legal challenge filed in December by Nebraska
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:51.060]  and Oklahoma which asked the US Supreme Court to strike down the history-making
[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:55.860]  law. Two lawsuits filed earlier this year by the anti-legalization group Safe
[01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:00.020]  Streets Alliance on behalf of several Colorado residents are also pending
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:05.020]  against the state over Amendment 64. Similar to the previous lawsuits, the new
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:09.100]  suit seeks to close all of Colorado's recreational marijuana stores but it
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:14.340]  also asks a federal judge to overturn Amendment 64's protections for
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:18.660]  marijuana use and possession. The law enforcement officials' suit claimed that
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:22.140]  local officers are breaking federal law and international treaties when they
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:26.700]  find marijuana but they do not seize it. At Thursday's news conference, Yuma
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:31.820]  County Sheriff Chad Day said Colorado's marijuana laws now prohibit officers
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:36.180]  from seizing marijuana in certain circumstances, putting officers, he said,
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:42.860]  in an inevitable position. That's kind of funny. By supporting and upholding one,
[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:47.420]  we're violating the other, he said. I'm excited to, at the very least, get an answer
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:51.540]  from the courts. Dude, these cops are not robots. They are people and they know
[01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:55.220]  they're they know what they're supposed to do. These guys are acting like we've
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:59.300]  got droids out there acting as police officers and we're gonna flip their
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:03.780]  switch and make their computers crash. This is ridiculous, dude. Sam Kamin, I'm
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:07.700]  probably saying that wrong, Sam K, a law professor at the University of Denver, was
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:11.820]  skeptical of the sheriff's argument. He said no law requires local officers to
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:17.580]  act as de facto federal drug agents. Of the four lawsuits, this is the one with
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:21.300]  the least merit, Kamin said. They have targeted not just the marijuana store
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:24.340]  regulation piece but they're also essentially saying Colorado can't
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:27.820]  legalize marijuana. No one has ever gone that far.
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:32.260]  Colorado plaintiffs in the latest lawsuit include Smith, Day, Elbert County
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:36.460]  Sheriff Shane Heap, Insdale County Sheriff Ronald Bruce, Kiowa County
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:40.980]  Sheriff Casey Sheridan and Delta County Sheriff Frederick McKee. Of the six
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:44.140]  Colorado sheriffs involved in the lawsuit, only Smith is from a county
[01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:50.740]  that approved Amendment 64 with 55% of 8,000 or 86,410 voters approving the
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:57.140]  measure. The measure was approved in 33 of 64 Colorado counties by a 55% margin.
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:02.460]  Also known named as plaintiffs are three Nebraska sheriffs, Adam Hayward of
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:06.300]  Duell County, Mark Overman of Scotts Bluff County and John Jensen of Cheyenne
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:10.260]  County. Cheyenne County Attorney Paul Schaub of Nebraska and Sheriff Charles
[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:15.140]  Mosier of Sherman, Wallace and Greeley counties in Kansas also signed the
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:17.660]  document. Sorry I kind of stumbled on that last part there but that was a lot
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:23.300]  of names is really all. As in the, excuse me, as in the lawsuit filed in Nebraska
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:26.820]  and Oklahoma, the law enforcement officials from Nebraska and Kansas are
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:31.740]  are arguing in the new lawsuit that marijuana flowing out of Colorado post
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:36.900]  legalization has led to more arrests and strain their budgets. Um I'm going to
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:42.580]  jump in here and say so legalized pot in your states just legalized weed in
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:47.700]  Nebraska and Oklahoma and Kansas and uh you won't have to worry about arresting
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:50.940]  more people and straining your budget. You'll be able to sell cannabis like we
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:53.940]  do here in Colorado and you'll be able to fill up your cash registers at the
[01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:57.620]  stores and you'll be able to fix your stupid ass roads that you guys have.
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:01.980]  Do think about it. Come on, let's use our fucking brains people. All right,
[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:05.700]  it's actually taking money out of Sherman County taxpayers pockets. Uh
[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:10.740]  Burton P. Nolto, the sheriff in Sherman County, Kansas said at Thursday's news
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:15.060]  conference in January nine out of the 46 people booked into Sherman County
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:19.380]  Jail were suspected of possessing or distributing hallucinogenic hallucinogenic
[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:22.540]  drugs. The category under which marijuana is classified in Kansas
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:27.540]  criminal law. According to an online booking log, two out of the 15 inmates
[01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:31.340]  listed on Thursday as being currently housed in the county jail face charges
[01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:36.340]  related to hallucinogenic drugs. So more bullshit. They call cannabis a
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:40.980]  hallucinogenic drug which is right in the same category is probably LSD
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:46.340]  mushrooms ecstasy. Um this is some cannabis you guys, this is medical
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:50.460]  marijuana. It's funny to think that over an invisible line that this is now
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:54.660]  a hallucinogenic drug and you cross this invisible line and now it's
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:58.540]  recreational cannabis and then you can cross another line and it's medical
[01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:03.300]  marijuana. This is so good. I love the time and place that we live in. This is
[01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:07.540]  so amazing to me. All right, where was I? Colorado officials have not yet
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:10.580]  responded to any of the pending lawsuits. Previously, state attorneys
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:13.540]  have argued that Colorado's more permissive marijuana laws, both for
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:17.280]  medical and recreational use and sales do not amount to legalization of
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:21.100]  marijuana. Instead, they contend that marijuana remains illegal in colorado
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:24.780]  aside from the specific exemptions allowed under the medical and
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:28.820]  recreational marijuana laws. When Nebraska and Oklahoma filed their
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:33.060]  lawsuit against colorado last year, then colorado Attorney General john john
[01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:37.220]  Southers said in a statement that it appears the plaintiffs primary grievance
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:41.580]  stems from a non enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana as opposed to
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:45.780]  choices made by the voters of colorado. Mason to vert one of the lead
[01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:49.860]  proponents of amendment 64 said if the lawsuits are successful in striking
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:53.660]  down the measure, it would lead to a system of marijuana chaos, which I
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:56.060]  would love to see what happened. I don't want it to happen, but it'd be
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:52:00.060]  really neat to see how it's dealt with because there are dispensaries on every
[01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:04.260]  other corner in Denver, every other corner in colorado Springs, Pueblo West
[01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:09.260]  has 12 or 15 dispensaries now in that small community. They are everywhere.
[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:12.340]  It would be hard to come and they'd have to go to California. They'd have
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:15.580]  to go to every state that's got medical cannabis. They couldn't just come here
[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:19.980]  because then that would be, they'd be singling us out, says this is just
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:23.440]  another case of the arrest and prosecution industry teaming up with
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:26.440]  marijuana prohibition groups to roll back the progress that has been made in
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:31.040]  colorado. He said in a statement thursday, U. S. Rep Jared polis said in
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:34.320]  a statement that the U. S. Department of Justice and President Obama have
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:37.620]  made clear that they will not interfere with the states whose citizens voted
[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:41.500]  for recreational marijuana use. This lawsuit is a silly attempt to
[01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:45.620]  circumvent the will of colorado voters and it is a waste of time. Polis
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:49.700]  statement says unfortunately these frivolous lawsuits will likely continue
[01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:54.740]  until we pass my bipartisan regulate marijuana like alcohol act and finally
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:53:00.300]  end the outdated federal prohibition of marijuana. So these states have filed a
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:04.000]  suit and they're trying to sue us to shut down our recreational marijuana
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:09.640]  program because they can't get cannabis to stop coming into their states. I
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:14.040]  think I said it the first time, stop fucking with us and do what you can to
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:19.480]  make respectable, responsible cannabis laws in Nebraska and Kansas and
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:24.000]  Oklahoma and then the states bordering those will have to follow suit and then
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.200]  eventually it will just be a whole green map instead of having a red and
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:31.120]  blue map. We'll start having all green states. This will be great. All right,
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:34.960]  so here's another article that I keep seeing pop up on social media. I'm
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:38.760]  finding this article on the cannabis. I get a lot of my articles from there. This
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:43.000]  was written by Christopher Ingraham from the Washington Post. There's a cute
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.080]  little headline article here or headline picture of a little bunny rabbit
[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:51.880]  sitting on a digital scale and the bunny weighs 93.2 grams. It's kind of cute.
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:57.200]  The headline says Utah DEA warns of stoned rabbits if state passes medical
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:03.920]  marijuana bill. I'll say it again. DEA warns of stoned rabbits if state passes
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:09.400]  medical marijuana bill. I'll let you take that in. Now I'll read the article.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:13.360]  Utah is considering a bill that would allow patients with certain debilitating
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:17.400]  conditions to be treated with edible forms of marijuana. If the bill passes,
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:21.720]  the state's wildlife may cultivate a taste for the plant, lose their fear of
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:25.520]  humans, and basically be high all the time. That's according to testimony
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:29.120]  presented to a Utah State panel last week by an agent of the Drug
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:34.000]  Enforcement Administration. I deal in facts. I deal in science at Special Agent
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.440]  Matt Fairbanks who's been working in the state for a decade. He is a member of the
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:42.640]  marijuana eradication team in Utah. Some of his colleagues in Georgia recently
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:47.520]  achieved notoriety by raiding a retirees garden and seizing a number of okra
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:52.360]  plants. Fairbanks spoke of his time eliminating backcountry marijuana grows
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:56.320]  in the Utah mountains, specifically the environmental costs associated with
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:00.640]  large-scale weed cultivation on public land. Personally, I've seen entire
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:04.880]  mountainside subjected to pesticides, harmful chemicals, deforestation, and
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:09.240]  erosion, he said. The ramifications to the flora, the animal life, the
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:13.720]  contaminated water are still unknown. Fairbanks said that at some illegal
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:17.280]  marijuana grow sites he saw rabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:21.760]  He continued, one of them refused to leave us as we took all the marijuana
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:26.080]  around him, but his natural instincts to run were somehow gone.
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:30.320]  It's true that illegal pot farming can have harmful environmental consequences.
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:34.040]  Of course, nothing about these consequences is unique to marijuana. If
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:38.320]  corn were outlawed, the cartels would start growing it on national forests. The
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:42.560]  per plant environmental toll would be about the same, which is kind of a neat
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:46.920]  fact. But backcounty marijuana grows are a direct result of marijuana's illegal
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:50.760]  status. If you're concerned about the environmental impact of the grows, an
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:54.720]  alternative is to legalize and regulate the plant so that people can grow it on
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:56:00.000]  farms and in their gardens rather than on remote mountainsides. Now, regarding
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.440]  stone rabbits, some wild animals apparently do develop a taste for bud.
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:09.000]  But I don't know that the occasional high rabbit constitutes for grounds for
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.480]  keeping marijuana prohibition in place any more than drunk squirrels are an
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:16.680]  argument for outlawing alcohol. And let's not even get started on the nationwide
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:20.240]  epidemic of catnip abuse.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.200]  There was a time not too long ago when drug warriors terrified a nation with
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.080]  images of the devil's weed and reefer madness. Now it seems that enforcers of
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:32.480]  marijuana law conjuring up a stoned bunny not scary enough for the Utah
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:35.680]  state. It seems the panel approved the bill and sent it to the full Senate
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:40.360]  where it will be debated this week. Well, good luck to you, Utah. I hope that
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.640]  this bill passes. I hope that you're allowed to consume an edible form of
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:49.680]  marijuana. Um, outlying cannabis in your state because the rabbits are going to
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:53.560]  get stoned would be a lot like outlying roads because dogs and squirrels are
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:57.520]  going to get ran over. It's kind of a stupid ass argument. Come up with
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:02.120]  something better. Uh, we aren't buying that bullshit anymore because I've got
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:04.880]  one more news article that I want to read and then we're going to wrap up the
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:11.000]  show. Uh, this one is from the toke of the town actually. And this will be the
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.680]  final news article that I am ever going to read from the toke of the town. And I
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:19.400]  will tell you why this article comes from the toke of the town. And it says
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:24.240]  after five years, toke of the town says goodbye. Since 2009, toke of the town
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:27.440]  has brought you the biggest marijuana news and the loudest pop views from
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:31.120]  across the country and around the world. Along the way, we've covered the huge
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:35.560]  progress many states have made toward legalization and wondered why others are
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:39.400]  so far behind. This country still has a long way to go, but things are looking
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:43.840]  up and we have our fingers crossed that 2015 will be another big year for
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:48.640]  legalization. But the toke won't be around to see it, at least not in its
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:53.400]  present form. This is the tokes toke of the town's final day of publication.
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:56.280]  And this was actually written at the end of the year. Don't worry, we're not
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.000]  quitting the movement. We're just returning the focus of our marijuana
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.840]  coverage to our local voice media group papers. You can still read William
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:07.200]  breeds weekly pot reviews and ask a stoner column at westward dot com where
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:10.520]  they started and you can continue to follow him on twitter and on facebook
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:13.560]  and you can keep following toke on facebook and twitter too for the latest
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:17.440]  marijuana news from all of our papers. Many thanks for reading and supporting
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:20.360]  us for the past five years. We couldn't have covered the marijuana community
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:24.680]  without such a strong one reading us of the community itself is a strong one. I
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:27.880]  was thrown off by the way they worded that uh and all of our archives will
[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:30.680]  remain online because we wouldn't want you to lose access to our serious
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:34.680]  reporting on issues of medicine and our lighthearted coverage of stoner movies.
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:38.720]  Light one up for us, won't you? So this is a little outdated because this was
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:41.360]  put out at the end of the year at the start of this year at the end of last
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:44.840]  year, the toke of the town is not posting any more news. I used to pull a
[01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:48.720]  lot of news articles from there, but I will not have them as a resource
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:52.280]  anymore. So we will miss you. Toke of the town. You were a great resource for
[01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:56.520]  my little podcast here. You provided a lot of news articles. I'll do a dab for
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:00.240]  you later. I'll miss the token of town. All right guys, that's enough news for
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:03.960]  one episode. I'm gonna wrap up the show here. It's been about 30 minutes. Let's
[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:06.880]  see how far we've been going. Look at that. I'm getting good at this. I did 31
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:10.960]  minutes. I didn't even know how much time we've done. I'm getting good. All
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:14.160]  right, let's see. Let's tease some next things. I think the garden of weeding
[01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:18.480]  will be here on the next episode. I have a phone interview planned with a
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:23.120]  cat known as soil grown on instagram. Uh, soil grown is doing something he
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:27.000]  calls rosin tech. You haven't seen that. We'll talk about that a little bit on
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:30.480]  the next episode. Uh, garden of we will be here. We're going to talk about

[02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:32.340]  get a like a board. I'm gonna prepare something next time so that it's not

[02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:15.460]  money. Spence, you had something to say go for it, bro. So I just tried to take
[02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:20.380]  a selfie that said episode 58 and there's a dab like right over my camera
[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:26.660]  to where it's like, it's all cloudy. That is good dab life for sure. Yeah, you
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:29.700]  know, you know, you're a dabber if your phone is sticky and has dabs on it. If
[02:06:29.700 --> 02:06:33.140]  you go to pick up your car keys, there's half a dab stuck to it. I had a dab in
[02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:35.620]  my beard the other morning when I woke up and I don't know what the hell
[02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:39.660]  happened there. But dab life got to give a shout out to the dads. And what's up
[02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:43.500]  with you taking selfies on the show? That's OG right there. OG triple triple.
[02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:46.540]  Big shout out to the sponsors. I did quick ads because Spence is here and
[02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:49.060]  we're high and I just want to get to the conversation. I don't want to ramble
[02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:51.820]  about commercials. You guys don't want to hear a lot of commercials. But if you
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:54.220]  guys are interested in sponsoring the show, send me an email. It's growfromyourheart
[02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:59.340]  at hotmail.com. I'll get you all of that info. So Spence texted me the other
[02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:02.780]  day. He's like, let's do a podcast dog. So I said, what do you want to talk about?
[02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:08.060]  And he said, canopy management. So we're gonna jump right into it. That was a good
[02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:11.900]  three minute intro. I like it. I like it. No rambles, no bullshit. So canopy
[02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:15.980]  management. I've been watching Spence follow a guy named Greenworks on
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:18.620]  Instagram. So a lot of this will be inspired by our buddy Greenworks. Big
[02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:22.780]  shout out. Shout out to the homie. Shout out to the homie. I choked when I said
[02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:27.500]  that. I guess I'm not allowed to say that. That was odd, man. So yeah, shout
[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:32.500]  out to Greenworks. He kind of inspired Spence to set up some really killer cage
[02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:36.900]  like, not really cages. The cage is only on top. Do you want to explain how you
[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:40.020]  did it or do you want me to keep rambling for you? All right. So it's
[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:47.300]  essentially a single plant scrug to where you have, we use bigger pods.
[02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:51.620]  Greenworks uses 27s. I'm pretty sure something like that. I use right around
[02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:55.980]  20s. So that's a 20 gallon pot. I've seen them and they look pretty big. They're
[02:07:55.980 --> 02:08:00.620]  about 22 inches around. Oh yeah. 18 inches tall. They're huge. Maybe even more than
[02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:05.540]  18, maybe about 24 inches tall. Which the plants. Oh yeah, the pots are two foot
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:11.660]  tall, probably easy. But it's just, it's, it works for what it is. It's all about,
[02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:16.780]  you know, working the surface area you're given, especially like in areas where
[02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:20.540]  they limit plant counts. You know what I'm saying? That could do a lot of things for
[02:08:20.540 --> 02:08:24.740]  people. I'm writing down the word surface area because that's a good thing to
[02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:28.060]  think about. We're gonna go back to that. So yeah, this, for people with limited
[02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:31.660]  plant counts in Colorado, well in our location, they're definitely messing with
[02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:35.460]  plant counts and we're not gonna be able to grow as many plants as we used
[02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:39.540]  to. So what Spence has done, he's taken these giant pots and he takes a plant
[02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:45.060]  and he builds a PVC sort of a frame around it. So it's just, he's got a square
[02:08:45.060 --> 02:08:50.060]  frame now above the plant. How big is that square? Anywhere from four by, it's a
[02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:55.500]  four by four square cage basically. You build a cage out of your PVC and you do
[02:08:55.500 --> 02:09:01.500]  layers of trellis for support. You know, if some people do, I'm not the only one
[02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:04.620]  that does it by the way. There's a lot of people now that are trying it because it
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:08.540]  works. I mean it's more bang for your buck if you have, you know, especially
[02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:14.100]  it's, in my opinion, it's strain dependent. You can still get good yields but you'll
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:17.380]  get better yields out of, you know, strains that are built for that system.
[02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:21.580]  Gorilla Glue loves it. Loves it. Bounty Killer loves it. You know what I'm saying? So
[02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:25.300]  like those moonshine haze, that haze plant loves to just grow all inside that
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:30.020]  net. So you know, there's things like that that works. Cookies, they'll do decent but
[02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:34.220]  not like, you know, a Gorilla Glue would do. So essentially it's a, you know, a four
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:38.980]  by four cage with, you know, multiple trellises and then you, you know, it will
[02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:43.900]  lollipop from the soil to the first trellis, you know. So everything from that
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:50.460]  first trellis up will be just nugs. Naked? Okay. Yeah. Wow. Alright. So you got, you got
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:54.100]  your frame, you got a square, then you put a net over and then you just got, excuse
[02:09:54.100 --> 02:09:56.700]  me guys, I'm choked up from the dabs, but then you just got a bud going through
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:59.620]  each part of the screen. Yeah. You put another screen on to support it and then
[02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:02.180]  if it gets out of control because it's Gorilla Glue, you got to put another
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:05.740]  third screen up there? If you need to and it's pretty fresh. But then again, it's
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:09.580]  more about, you know, canopy management. Like making sure while it's, you know,
[02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:14.700]  especially through the stretch phase from day one of flower till day 21, 22-ish
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:18.300]  when it's growing like crazy. You'll want to get in there and really like tie them
[02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:23.900]  down, make sure they're not growing out of what they need to. So it's, you know,
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:26.900]  with those trellis nets, I think they're like three by three squares or four by
[02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:31.820]  four squares. You know, you want to try to essentially get a nug or a cola to hit
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:36.340]  every single one of those squares. I mean, there's, I don't know if there's 60 of
[02:10:36.340 --> 02:10:40.500]  them on a plant, so just, you know, the surface area works. Okay. Wow. Okay. So
[02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:46.620]  how early into veg do you start manipulating the screen? So typically
[02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:54.460]  what I do is I'll go from a one gallon pot or a clone to one gallon, one gallon
[02:10:54.460 --> 02:10:58.740]  to three, and I'll let that three kind of get bulky in that three gallon and
[02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:03.220]  then straight into the final pots and then give them, you know, five, six weeks
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:06.300]  veg. It's really not as long as people think it is, especially when it's strain
[02:11:06.300 --> 02:11:10.500]  dependent and strains grow, you know, faster than other strains. Yeah. And it's
[02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:12.420]  going to be worth it in the end because you're going to get the weight in the
[02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:18.420]  end. So once you, you know, find your strain that you want to use, you know,
[02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:21.780]  you basically are training it through the nets, you know what I'm saying? So if
[02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:26.380]  it's getting too tall, throw another trellis on it, make it go back under the
[02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:29.460]  trellis. You know what I'm saying? Just keep bending it. Yeah. You can keep
[02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:33.460]  bending it. What I like to do is I like to just kind of on your first screen, you
[02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:37.380]  kind of spread it open and then you let all the insides grow up and everything
[02:11:37.380 --> 02:11:41.180]  on the outside is going to grow around in the cage. So all those little shoots
[02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:43.940]  that would just be cut off if you're lollipopping normally are going to grow
[02:11:43.940 --> 02:11:46.740]  into actual branches. Yeah. They're going to go straight up into branches. So
[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:49.780]  that's what the gorilla glue you're going to get long extended branches out
[02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:53.940]  like I have branches from like the bottom of the stock that shoot clear up
[02:11:53.940 --> 02:11:58.820]  to the top. Damn. Canopy management. Okay. I read an article a long time ago
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:01.180]  that kind of introduced me to this idea. The article was actually called
[02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:05.220]  growing on the grid is what I think it was called. And the author was Eric
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:08.860]  Vickso. I'm going to Google that just to make sure. But he was used to be a
[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:12.300]  writer for high times and he wrote an article about this. I'm searching his
[02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:17.820]  name while I talk. But I'm pretty sure that's it. I want to make sure because I
[02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:19.820]  want to give you guys a reference. Yeah, it's called growing on the grid
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:23.380]  with Eric Vickso. It'll kind of if you guys want to read more about it, this is
[02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:29.100]  kind of we're going to give you the the inaction in practice sort of talk. Eric
[02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:32.060]  Vickso is he writes a lot. So he's going to give you a really technical
[02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:36.500]  explanation on it. However, I'm not sure how many times he's done it. Spence here
[02:12:36.500 --> 02:12:41.060]  has done it. Are you messaging Greenworks? We're gonna try to get
[02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:44.540]  Greenworks to call in one day and we'll talk to him. We've got I just actually
[02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:49.980]  learned how to record quality phone interviews using FaceTime. I probably
[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:52.580]  can do it with Skype also. I just haven't experimented with that yet. The other
[02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:55.460]  night I opened up FaceTime and played around and I'll be able to record so
[02:12:55.460 --> 02:12:58.540]  you guys want to be on the show and you're far away. FaceTime is now the way
[02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:03.580]  to do it. It'll be great. Greenworks, I'm inviting you call us. Speaking of
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:06.420]  FaceTime, I'm gonna get a I want to talk about this guy in a couple of minutes,
[02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:09.540]  but I'll talk more about can it can it be management. But I have a phone
[02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:14.140]  interview planned with a guy named soil grown from Instagram. We'll talk about
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:19.740]  his tech here pretty soon. Nice. Yeah. So you've got this 20 gallon pot full of
[02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:24.500]  soil. You've got you said you go from a clone cup into the one gallon pot into
[02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:29.780]  the three and then the three goes into the 20. Do you top before you transplant
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:36.900]  into the 20 at all? I'm not really a big topper depending on strain. So like for
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:42.260]  this system Gorilla Glue, I don't it's a plant to me. Some people do top it, but
[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:46.140]  I'm more of just kind of, you know, working it through the net. So I'll take
[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:49.420]  one branch and take it all the way to the left side and take this branch and
[02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:52.740]  take it to the right side. And eventually in that system, it's gonna fill itself
[02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:56.740]  back up. Well, I didn't realize it would work that extremely. So if I've got like
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:13:59.860]  if I took my whole arm and just bent it over, it's gonna just make little shoots
[02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:03.260]  and this is just gonna be horizontal for four feet across the room pretty or two
[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:07.100]  feet from each. So essentially what you want to do is you know, as you're you
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:12.900]  know, your colas grow your nodes stack vertically. They grow together up. So if
[02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:16.140]  you were to bend that branch all the way down, you'll take in each one of those
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:20.660]  bud sites, turn them up, which creates more bud sites on that plant than you
[02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:24.700]  would get stacking it together. Okay, so you're not gonna you may not get as many
[02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:28.340]  long. Yeah, you won't get like giant colas, but you'll get a bunch and it's
[02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:31.340]  all about the space because we're not trying to grow concrete underneath the
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:34.500]  plant. We're trying to grow all of the space for the plant. All right, that makes
[02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:37.620]  pretty good sense. So you don't top it all. That's see I would have topped them.
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:42.780]  That's why I would have fucked up from the very beginning. Some strains I do. Gorilla glue is one of the ones that it kind of grows.
[02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:48.460]  That plant's wild. It grows by itself. It'll grow with his eyes closed. Yeah, we're probably taunting a lot of people
[02:14:48.460 --> 02:14:51.660]  because a lot of the world can't get their hands on a gorilla glue cut. But there's
[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:56.100]  there's you know there's some things I would do early in veg. You know,
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:59.780]  because you give them a nice you know five, six week veg. So a couple two weeks
[02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:03.220]  worth of you know femming and you know training and stuff like that and then
[02:15:03.220 --> 02:15:07.780]  you know kind of once they three weeks before flower you gotta let them heal up
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:12.100]  a little bit. Yeah, at least two weeks, three weeks. Quit messing with them so
[02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:14.860]  that they know what to do because they are apical dominant. They want to know
[02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:21.060]  which way is up still. You gotta build up some hormones. All right, then I have like
[02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:25.620]  seven questions in my head and I can't I was like which ask a question. If it's
[02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:32.740]  not gorilla glue, what other strain do you like to scrog? Let's see. Because I
[02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:35.820]  know you've got a killer arsenal. Have you done the white widow this way? No,
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:39.940]  no, this this is my first go at it. So like and it looks impressive for his
[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:45.020]  first go at it. I'm blown away and it's I'm still learning like the curve. I'm
[02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:49.700]  still picking up the curve which is you know going from you know seven and tens
[02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:54.020]  up to 20s and two plants that are two to three times the size. You know
[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:57.460]  maintenance on those plants like you always have to be like cleaning up the
[02:15:57.460 --> 02:16:03.300]  bottoms and stuff because imagine you know a six foot plant that's four and a
[02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:06.580]  half feet wide. Yeah, you know there's no light underneath there so the things
[02:16:06.580 --> 02:16:09.500]  like the leaves and stuff die off just because they don't get light to survive.
[02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:13.940]  So you have to constantly be in there picking them off and things like that.
[02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:17.740]  It's a good thing to think about. I like that you said that would have been a six
[02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:20.380]  foot tall plant that you've gotten it down to four feet tall. That kind of puts
[02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:23.380]  it into a lot of perspective for me. Yeah, like my extreme I'm running
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:29.700]  Gevitas in a nine foot ceiling room but it's all about canopy. You keep them down
[02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:34.100]  the light the Gevitas will work for you. It's just all about like in my opinion
[02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:38.220]  when you when plants get tall and get close up to the Gevitas and then they
[02:16:38.220 --> 02:16:42.380]  kind of feel how powerful they are. Yeah, but when you get that canopy, yeah when you
[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:45.620]  get that canopy management all the way down you know it's all about surface
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:50.420]  area. How do you have a prediction on how much weight you're gonna pull per
[02:16:50.540 --> 02:16:56.020]  thousand watt light with this new system? Well right now per thousand watt I'll
[02:16:56.020 --> 02:17:04.980]  probably pull on my first go probably six seven hundred grams per Gorilla Glue.
[02:17:04.980 --> 02:17:08.380]  That's not bad at all. That's over a pound. That's a pound and a quarter. Yeah,
[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:15.660]  pound and a half if it comes back right. Okay. And that'll be pound and a half
[02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:19.940]  with it's only in a 4k. I'm running a 4k Gevitas. And for a six week veg that's
[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:23.860]  not bad at all. The plants really grow like when you put them from a
[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:28.220]  three gallon pot into a plant a pot. Oh I've seen the stalks of your plants and
[02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:31.260]  they're bigger around than these microphone stands. They're almost as big as my arms.
[02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:36.460]  I'm not that big. Like their wrist size for sure. Wow yeah it's impressive. Your
[02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:39.100]  rooms look great. I've been in there well I've been in there in a few days or so
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:40.980]  but I've been there recently and they look pretty darn good.
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:46.100]  Shout out to Big Mike, Maddie, Michael, everybody that keeps the gardens on
[02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:52.780]  track. Who else helps over there? Tater comes over. Phil. Oh we can't forget Phil.
[02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:59.340]  We need to get Phil on a podcast. Phil is really the... he raps. Phil raps? Oh we
[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:03.140]  can let him come rap. He can do all that. Throw up a beat and let Phil rap. He raps better than I do.
[02:18:03.140 --> 02:18:07.100]  Bring Phil and Slop. We can do some raps together. You guys are invited on the
[02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:11.580]  show boys if you listen to this. Michael, Big Mike, Slop, Phil, Maddie. You guys are
[02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:15.060]  always welcome. Whenever you want to do a podcast just text me and say it's podcast time.
[02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:23.860]  Can we do a live podcast at the cup? We couldn't do it like live broadcasting
[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:29.780]  but we could record it. What if I have a house and all that? See I talked about taking my
[02:18:29.780 --> 02:18:32.900]  recording equipment to the cup and just taking it to my hotel. Just bring it to my house.
[02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:36.740]  Yeah bring it to your house and we could do it up there and record people. Call
[02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:40.700]  cool people. That's what I was thinking. Hey guy you're cool come come podcast
[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:45.820]  with us. You cool guys you want to come get on my show? If you guys are gonna be... this is not
[02:18:45.820 --> 02:18:48.340]  set in stone but if you guys gonna be in the Denver area during the Cannabis Cup
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:51.060]  and you're down with Spence and you want to take a dab with Ross DeJeff in the
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:55.240]  Garden of Weed and Crew. There's a good chance I will bring some maybe not this
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:58.540]  big ol setup but I might bring some small recording gear. I just have a lot
[02:18:58.540 --> 02:19:01.460]  going on I don't want this to disappear while I'm at the cup or something. For
[02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:04.900]  sure. From the car or some shit. I get paired. This is my livelihood so I'd be
[02:19:04.900 --> 02:19:09.100]  crushed without it but uh this gear some kind of recording gear may end up at the
[02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:13.220]  can I've got my phone if nothing else that works well. Yeah. Let's do a
[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:15.820]  podcast or let's at least hang out at the Cannabis Cup you guys and take some
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:20.380]  dabs. This show won't come out for probably a week from it's tomorrow. Yeah
[02:19:20.380 --> 02:19:24.540]  weeks tomorrow so yeah but they'll have plenty of time it's just the middle of
[02:19:24.540 --> 02:19:26.780]  March when this comes out. Let's meet up the Cannabis Cup you guys let's take
[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:30.940]  some dabs. I should have some Jeff's OG dabs if Spence is down to blast it for
[02:19:30.940 --> 02:19:36.060]  me. I'll let him do that. No diggity. No diggity. Let's do this. All right where
[02:19:36.060 --> 02:19:38.380]  were we? We're talking about canopy management. I feel like we got a lot of
[02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:43.340]  that covered. If you're not gonna do the scroggs you can lollipop really heavily
[02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:46.860]  that's another good way to make space for what you've got. Kind of pay
[02:19:46.860 --> 02:19:51.460]  attention get down on your knees and see how far the light is getting into your
[02:19:51.460 --> 02:19:54.820]  plants and when you don't see any light hitting those leaves just clean that
[02:19:54.820 --> 02:19:57.300]  shit off from the bottom there because there's no light getting there it's
[02:19:57.300 --> 02:20:01.300]  gonna be a waste of space. That's also I mean there's also other ways of canopy
[02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:06.220]  management like there's you can do staking. I do lots of staking. Me too. I
[02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:11.220]  honestly do both. I like the scrogg system but I still like the old-school
[02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:15.180]  you know like look going in a room and being a hundred stakes deep in there and
[02:20:15.180 --> 02:20:19.140]  it's like oh lord. That's how Dred over at River Rock does it if you walk through
[02:20:19.140 --> 02:20:22.860]  there it's Stakes Central. Those guys got all the wood. Stakes City. Yeah yeah they
[02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:27.140]  got wood for days. I like some stakes. I grow some I tend to grow tall plants. I
[02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:30.380]  use a seven gallon pot and I veg them till they're about three and a half feet
[02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:33.860]  tall so they end up six feet tall by the end. That requires either a tomato
[02:20:33.980 --> 02:20:37.900]  cage or some staking. Yeah I like the staking because I can pull it apart and
[02:20:37.900 --> 02:20:42.220]  I can support each nug in a different area so I can kind of do what you
[02:20:42.220 --> 02:20:47.660]  do. You just surface area. Yeah basically train it to like this this cola's got
[02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:51.140]  this section this cola's got this section you want to kind of fill as many
[02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:54.860]  sections as you can. Yeah yeah and if you think about what kind of genetics you're
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:20:58.460]  using like you were saying the golden goat or the gorilla glue makes a whole
[02:20:58.460 --> 02:21:02.220]  bunch of heads. The golden goat will make a whole bunch of heads. Cookies doesn't
[02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:06.180]  really like to do it so maybe grow a whole bunch of small cookies plants. Like
[02:21:06.180 --> 02:21:10.420]  just if you can do a bunch of two foot tall three foot tall cookies. Flower it.
[02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:14.200]  Yeah that's the way to go with the plant like that. Just a seed of green. Or some OG
[02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:17.580]  Kush. Just do a bunch of small ones instead of one giant plant. It's all
[02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:22.220]  about the genetics and canopy management I guess. Yeah use a fan. You still need
[02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:24.980]  fans when you're doing all this. People forget about airflow. We can't stress
[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:28.100]  enough about airflow. Somebody's told me they had powdery mildew. They couldn't
[02:21:28.100 --> 02:21:31.020]  figure out how to beat it. They're asking what to spray and I said don't spray
[02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:34.900]  something get a dehumidifier and clean out the air in your room. So they're
[02:21:34.900 --> 02:21:40.700]  simple stuff. Cut all that shit off if you can. Yeah cut all that bottom shit down. If I see any bad shit it's going bye bye.
[02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:44.380]  Bye bye. Alright what else you got about canopy management? You want to talk about
[02:21:44.380 --> 02:21:54.260]  something different? It's been 15 minutes. Canopy management. Um let's see. What do you think about the
[02:21:54.260 --> 02:22:00.140]  levels of your lights during flower to help you know like in early induce or
[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:02.780]  the first couple weeks of flower do you keep them lower? Do you keep them further
[02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:07.540]  away? You know I kind of my lights don't move. I start with sometimes I'll put my
[02:22:07.540 --> 02:22:10.420]  plants on a five gallon bucket to get them higher but for the duration of the
[02:22:10.420 --> 02:22:13.580]  grow my plant my lights don't move. I'm tall and I hate moving the lights down
[02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:17.700]  where I hit my head on them. I keep them as high as they'll go in the rooms. One
[02:22:17.700 --> 02:22:22.380]  thing I do is I don't change out from the halides to the sodiums for the first
[02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:25.940]  two weeks of flower. They stay blue. Stay blue yeah and they keep some I feel like
[02:22:25.940 --> 02:22:31.340]  they don't stretch as far and when I do the switch I see them start to bulk up
[02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:35.140]  right away at the two weeks instead of doing that extra week yeah and I really
[02:22:35.140 --> 02:22:39.420]  think that that helps and I have stopped doing. Do you veg with blue lights? Yeah. Okay so
[02:22:39.420 --> 02:22:43.660]  they're just used to that probably that change from blue to HBS kind of gives
[02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:48.180]  them a time span they got to get used to that shit real quick. Right. I do dark
[02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:51.460]  periods you know before flower. And I was about to say I've stopped doing that. I
[02:22:51.460 --> 02:22:57.660]  don't find it useful really it doesn't do anything. I used to veg under 24
[02:22:57.660 --> 02:23:01.900]  hours and then I would veg for 24 and then go dark for 24 and then start my
[02:23:01.900 --> 02:23:06.380]  flower and I noticed it would trigger a little more quickly but it's not enough
[02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:09.980]  time to do anything. I kind of like let my plants do their thing. For some reason I just
[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:15.500]  feel like when I go because you know when so I go 18 to 6. Yeah that's what I'm
[02:23:15.500 --> 02:23:20.260]  doing now. Into flower so usually like when they sleep they're ugly you know
[02:23:20.260 --> 02:23:23.860]  they're just sleeping you know I'm saying. I'm not the prettiest person when
[02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:28.860]  I'm asleep and then when they you know eventually when the lights come back on
[02:23:28.860 --> 02:23:33.460]  there get into the swing of things and then you know before the lights cut off
[02:23:33.460 --> 02:23:39.580]  they'll start going back down and then when I usually hit that I do 48 hours
[02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:43.700]  dark there as soon as I go in the rooms even when it's dark they're already
[02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:47.220]  praying and ready. I feel like they're just preparing themselves for the time
[02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:52.500]  change. Yeah. Excited for it. Yeah it's crazy how like you know plants will be
[02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:55.980]  veg looking and then that dark period you go in there and it's like oh shit
[02:23:55.980 --> 02:24:01.060]  they're ready. Plants are these plants tell us what they want that's for sure. I
[02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:04.540]  like that. Guys don't be afraid to try a different light cycle. My mother plants
[02:24:04.540 --> 02:24:09.820]  run on a 19-5 cycle recommended by DJ or night is it 19-5 yeah 19-5 recommended by
[02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:14.500]  DJ Short and that's the best performance I've ever had from a mother plant. So
[02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:19.660]  don't be afraid to experiment with some stuff. Now I do the I do 18-6 in my veg
[02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:23.500]  areas and then my flower I just go straight 12-12 because I don't really I
[02:24:23.500 --> 02:24:27.980]  don't do the dark period. I do 12-12 the dark period is the only thing I do
[02:24:27.980 --> 02:24:31.800]  just start flower. Some of the best herb I've ever grown was actually grown under
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:38.420]  a under a single hood and a 5x5 hydro hut with a 600 watt high pressure sodium
[02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:41.900]  and a 400 watt metal halide in the same bulb and that Grozilla bulb that
[02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:47.620]  Hydro Farm makes. The double bulb? Yeah. I used one of those I liked it. That was great great bud it had
[02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:51.140]  great flavor it looked great some of my best pictures came from that run of
[02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:55.380]  flower. It was definitely quality buds my best grow of that headband cut ever.
[02:24:55.380 --> 02:25:02.100]  Yeah what are you dabbing over there bro? Some bounty killer. Say what? Nice.
[02:25:02.100 --> 02:25:06.500]  Shout out to the dude that grew the bounty killer. What's up bro I see you
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:13.300]  over there I know what you're doing. Appreciate you. Every day. So you want to
[02:25:13.300 --> 02:25:17.300]  talk about Greenworks for a minute or not Greenworks what's his name should I
[02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:19.740]  wrote it down because I keep your soil grown there's so many of these new
[02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:22.420]  Instagram names that I can't keep up honestly I try to be on top all the
[02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:28.420]  social media but there's so many things going on. If you guys have something that
[02:25:28.420 --> 02:25:31.140]  you want to hear about canopy management that we missed remind me because we went
[02:25:31.140 --> 02:25:35.580]  quickly there's still more to talk about but we're we've done enough on it that's
[02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:40.540]  like 15 minutes we're gonna talk about some new shit. Oh you hear that you guys
[02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:43.580]  that's a mothership rig right over there it's a little mothership mini with a
[02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:47.300]  swing arm mothership carb cap on it it's a bounty killer live resin life doesn't
[02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:52.380]  get much better than that y'all. The look on Spence's face proves it I'm not sure
[02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:56.940]  that he knows where he is right now. Your eyes your hoodie and the microphone
[02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:00.500]  cover are all the same shade of red. Don't worry. I ain't worried I'm just
[02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:04.700]  letting you know don't try to drive home like that. So there's this new shit it's
[02:26:04.700 --> 02:26:10.140]  called Rosin. Rosen? Rosen? Rosen? I've been calling it Rosen. I've been calling it Rosen.
[02:26:10.140 --> 02:26:14.780]  I've been calling it Rosen. Whichever way you want to do it it's spelled
[02:26:14.780 --> 02:26:20.260]  R-O-S-I-N so we can't argue that. I saw it first on Instagram from a dude named
[02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:25.900]  Soilgrown called at Soilgrown. This dude what do you think bro how do you feel
[02:26:25.900 --> 02:26:27.860]  about it I don't want to give it away too much of his tech because we're gonna
[02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:34.140]  have him here on the show pretty soon. Um I will gladly support somebody trying
[02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:41.460]  something new for sure like no doubts. Um I was listening to Hash Church today
[02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:46.060]  shout out to Hash Church check that out guys. Don't like don't freak out on me
[02:26:46.060 --> 02:26:49.260]  because I say this because people argue about it all the time but it's the first
[02:26:49.260 --> 02:26:55.900]  non-solvent actual not no there's not like water as much as you don't you
[02:26:55.900 --> 02:27:00.500]  don't believe it it's a solvent. Then the butane and propane those are all
[02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:05.780]  solvents but he's just using pure heat to extract oils there's no you can't use
[02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:12.220]  heat as a solvent. Heat and pressure. Did you see the picture of the whole slab he posted?
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:19.340]  Oh no I saw one that's like rolled up in a worm around a car cab. It was a giant one it was as big as his face so he's been going in lately.
[02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:22.900]  Yeah I've got a scheduled phone interview with him he said Tuesday or
[02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:26.100]  Wednesday he hasn't confirmed a specific time but we're gonna talk to him I'll
[02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:29.420]  probably just piece that right into this episode you guys if I can get him to
[02:27:29.420 --> 02:27:32.900]  call me on time that's all I need I'll throw that into this show probably right
[02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:35.980]  here so here's an interview maybe hopefully with Soilgrown. How you doing
[02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:41.380]  today bro? Great man I'm doing good. Cool man thanks for pulling some time away from your work to join us.
[02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:48.220]  Yeah not a problem. Dude I'm just gonna I know you're busy man I'm just gonna get right to it and start asking a couple of quick questions.
[02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:52.140]  First of all can you explain to me a little bit about what Rosentech is and
[02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:54.860]  how you got the idea?
[02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:33.660]  So I did this different method. Rosin I guess what rosin is is technically it's just a form of resin obtained from my plant you know.
[02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:38.300]  That's where like I don't I don't know why it's called rosin I mean it's similar.
[02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:45.020]  Like rosin what I know rosin as was like you know for both strings for friction so you can get better.
[02:28:45.020 --> 02:28:49.500]  But I don't know where the term actually stuck in cannabis but that's where I
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:54.220]  know it's from and it's really kind of related to resin you know in a way.
[02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:56.220]  Okay.
[02:28:56.220 --> 02:29:08.700]  But the way I got my idea I mean it came from basically I'm a hash bean you know so I'm running out my milk so I decided I need to figure something out.
[02:29:08.700 --> 02:29:16.540]  I have all this no milk and I remember back when Selected Nicotine put something on the IG about
[02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:25.340]  taking like a flat iron just for pressing you know just to press out your hash much simpler than heating up a wand or you know doing something like that.
[02:29:25.340 --> 02:29:30.140]  You can set the right temp just to press it out and have a proper press depth.
[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:38.700]  Well I used to take my wife's hair curler and I would sometimes I'd get it too hot you know by accident and I would notice that it would separate.
[02:29:38.700 --> 02:29:41.260]  You see the oil and then the hash.
[02:29:41.340 --> 02:29:44.940]  I wouldn't think anything this was like you know this was a while back.
[02:29:44.940 --> 02:29:55.580]  I didn't think anything of it I would just pull the parchment back up and now I have a pressed patty that was over pressed and with too much heat but otherwise it was some pressed hash you know.
[02:29:55.580 --> 02:29:56.540]  Okay.
[02:29:56.540 --> 02:29:57.340]  Made it smokeable.
[02:29:57.340 --> 02:29:58.780]  Made it better.
[02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:00.140]  Yeah you know I mean it was better.
[02:30:00.140 --> 02:30:02.140]  How many years ago do you think that was?
[02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:06.220]  That was not too long ago maybe about two years ago.
[02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:07.500]  Okay.
[02:30:07.580 --> 02:30:17.580]  Probably about two years ago when I did that and then you know that just doing like the French effects anything that didn't melt I would triple press it you know try to increase the melt quality on it.
[02:30:17.580 --> 02:30:19.580]  Some stuff didn't some stuff did.
[02:30:21.260 --> 02:30:24.940]  So what gave you the idea to just start pressing straight buds without trying hash in there?
[02:30:26.220 --> 02:30:32.780]  All right so once I ran out of my no melt all my no melt and turning it into rotten and smoking.
[02:30:33.260 --> 02:30:39.900]  So we just took I don't know we're just sitting here smoking you know I'm not I smoke flour but my thing is dabbing.
[02:30:39.900 --> 02:30:42.300]  I'm more of an expert you know.
[02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:43.420]  Me too definitely.
[02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:52.540]  Yeah so so we're just I'm sitting here uh bullshitting with my uh father-in-law and uh I'm like hey let's try this.
[02:30:52.540 --> 02:31:01.900]  I grabbed the nugget he's like what are you doing I put it in between the parchment just like I would uh uh you know a rolled up ball of hash and uh my surprise.
[02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:06.780]  Resin squeezed out of the bud we were both in shock like no way.
[02:31:07.500 --> 02:31:14.700]  So I scooped up the oil did it again scooped it up there was a little there was enough on the end looked like a dab but we tried it out.
[02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:23.260]  And uh and uh to my surprise you know melted to nothing no not like no residue.
[02:31:24.700 --> 02:31:29.660]  And sometimes you're gonna get from even good BHO will leave a residue sometimes so that's impressive.
[02:31:29.660 --> 02:31:31.980]  Yeah yeah exactly.
[02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:35.180]  Very sweet very fucking cool man you got lucky figuring that one out.
[02:31:36.140 --> 02:31:40.860]  Yeah I would I would you know call it luck luck for you to say it but uh I mean I just I'd say
[02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:45.980]  I might I mean if I didn't do what I did like if I didn't sit here and smoke like I do every day
[02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:51.740]  and I wasn't so much into the to the concentrate aspect of cannabis then I wouldn't be the one to
[02:31:51.740 --> 02:31:52.540]  strike the luck.
[02:31:52.540 --> 02:31:55.820]  Right yeah man much respect for putting in the work for putting in the time to get to there
[02:31:55.820 --> 02:31:59.660]  and for loving that the extracts as much as you do to find that for us because it seems to be the
[02:31:59.660 --> 02:32:01.420]  thing now bro you're blowing up on Instagram.
[02:32:02.620 --> 02:32:07.660]  Yeah you know I didn't and when I posted I really didn't expect that I thought it'd be like you
[02:32:07.660 --> 02:32:13.820]  know something some of these uh hash makers are like could could utilize for all their no-no.
[02:32:13.820 --> 02:32:17.580]  So then once I started posting up the flower I was just thinking you know some people would be like
[02:32:18.460 --> 02:32:21.740]  you know in awe about it but I didn't expect that no way.
[02:32:21.740 --> 02:32:25.500]  Yeah bro can you tell me just kind of a brief I know it's just a pretty simple process can
[02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:27.020]  you tell me kind of briefly how you do it?
[02:32:27.580 --> 02:32:32.220]  Yeah I mean I would say it's probably the most simplest process of extraction I would say uh
[02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:37.420]  I mean if you want to do it the most basic way to do it for anybody at home is just grab your uh
[02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:41.980]  grab your ladies flat iron or hair straightener get the widest one you can.
[02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:49.340]  Digital settings would be optimum if not I mean when I first did it I had it up to 420 degrees.
[02:32:49.340 --> 02:32:51.020]  You raised those buds.
[02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:57.340]  Yeah I mean the turpines were I wasn't worried about uh I was I wanted turpines but I wanted
[02:32:57.340 --> 02:33:03.260]  that melt you know so to my surprise I was pulling melts out now that I've fine-tuned it a little bit
[02:33:03.260 --> 02:33:07.020]  and there's going to be a lot more evolving to it it's just in its beginning stage.
[02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:07.740]  For sure.
[02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:12.460]  But uh you know fine-tuning and stuff to get those those turps out of it but.
[02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:16.620]  So you just get the uh the straightening comb or the flat iron
[02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:18.860]  and then just basically put some parchment in there?
[02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:24.060]  Yeah so you put it between the parchment and then uh put it between the flat iron.
[02:33:24.060 --> 02:33:27.980]  You want to do it in a quick process as fast as possible put it between that flat iron
[02:33:27.980 --> 02:33:31.660]  and then press it as hard as you can you know press as hard as you can for about
[02:33:32.300 --> 02:33:36.380]  I'd say one to two two to three seconds depending like how hot you got your
[02:33:37.100 --> 02:33:43.900]  iron but you really you hear it come out it mostly it comes down to trial and error and hearing that
[02:33:43.900 --> 02:33:49.180]  that sound of knowing when to pull up and you know knowing when you have it too hot it's
[02:33:49.180 --> 02:33:50.860]  it's a lot of ear it really is.
[02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:55.820]  All right so I just got to practice and waste a couple of buds but it doesn't look like you're
[02:33:55.820 --> 02:33:59.260]  doing a lot of buds at one time so that's not too big of a deal to waste a couple nuggets.
[02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:03.820]  Yeah yeah I don't do the hair straightening anymore I mean I do the press now.
[02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:05.500]  Yeah I see you doing big things now.
[02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:10.300]  Yeah it's a little bigger you know I'm still I have a lot of other plans for
[02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:16.220]  for something to make it a more efficient process but right now this just seems to work it's
[02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:21.180]  if I can fine-tune this to make it workable then whatever goes on after it's just going to be
[02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:21.660]  better.
[02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:24.860]  There you go keep improving every day that's the way this industry is working.
[02:34:24.860 --> 02:34:28.460]  So how are you doing are you doing anything special to prepare the buds do you like them
[02:34:28.460 --> 02:34:31.420]  a little moist you like them dry do you like them crispy do you like them cured?
[02:34:32.780 --> 02:34:36.060]  I'd say a properly grown well cured bud.
[02:34:36.060 --> 02:34:36.560]  Okay.
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:43.040]  That's how I would look at it but that is to dry works something that might have a little
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:49.120]  too much moisture it probably will work I haven't had too much like trial with that
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:55.680]  I've had like fresh nugs and I haven't had too many results with it nothing nothing to
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:57.040]  be ecstatic about.
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:35:00.080]  Okay so it's better to let the moisture come out a little bit let it dry up.
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:05.440]  Yeah and I don't know how the moisture is gonna affect the
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:10.960]  expect whether we see it or not I can't see how it wouldn't you know moisture heat and
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:15.920]  resonance just somehow trapping in there just like when you're prepping some not properly
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:23.680]  dried IWE you know you're trapping moisture so I don't I can see that being the same for
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:24.720]  this process.
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:28.720]  All right do uh do certain strains work better do you like indica's or sativa's work better
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:31.280]  or do you have a favorite strain that works the best for making rosin?
[02:35:32.240 --> 02:35:37.040]  All right now I'm finding that indica's are producing they're having the most resin I
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:43.440]  mean I've even had some real frosty sativa's you know only putting out like eight to nine
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:50.800]  percent but I've had some indica's pull around I mean anywhere from like nine to 22 percent
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:51.280]  you know.
[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:54.080]  Wow that's impressive that's getting up there with the uh the BHO pulls.
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:58.720]  Yeah I mean it really that depends on how much time and effort you want to put into
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:03.040]  if you want to sit there and do it as point one I mean you want to break the blood down
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:06.480]  if you're doing it in a whole gram you're probably not going to get the percentage you're
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:12.480]  looking for on big scale it might suffice because uh it's going to be how efficient
[02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:14.320]  the process is but.
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:19.360]  All right so break it up a little bit or the more the more broken up the better actually
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:24.560]  all right that's good to know um how does the flavor of a rosin dab compare to like
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:27.440]  a BHO dab or a saltless dab are you still getting good flavors?
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:33.680]  Yeah man it's it's unbelievable I can't wait to send in some of these samples for testing.
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:37.440]  That was one of my next questions I was going to ask if you've had anything tested or if
[02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:39.440]  anybody that you know has had it tested yet.
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:44.560]  Yeah actually uh foundation extracts I think somebody else had some actually hash files
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:47.600]  we tested it seemed like it was pretty high in CBD.
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:48.000]  Okay.
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.440]  I posted up the results on my IG page with the uh the results from foundation extract
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:57.200]  I think it was like 83 percent THC and eight percent terpene.
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:58.640]  Wow that's good.
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:04.320]  You know and I don't know who it's to come I'm just guessing that it was made off of
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:06.320]  a hair straightener you know.
[02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:06.640]  Okay.
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:11.360]  So a little bit less uh control on it.
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:15.920]  Have you seen any hatred from all the BHO people the guys that spent thousands of dollars
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:18.080]  on equipment and now you're just doing it with a shirt press?
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:25.760]  Uh yeah you know I've seen a little bit of hate you know uh it's not it's not bad some
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:30.160]  of it's more of like on the down low some people are kind of burnt and then most of
[02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:34.960]  the time there's a lot of people are just like just not giving it a chance but then
[02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:39.920]  you know like I'll see them I'll see some of these people like changing their minds
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:44.480]  about it they're trying it out once they try it like you can't knock it till you try it.
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:48.160]  Right but that's how this industry is though you know this industry is kind of tricky they
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:49.200]  make decisions right away.
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:53.200]  Yeah it is you're right you're right it's just how the way the world it's the way the
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:56.960]  world works but you know when you do that you're going to be the one to miss out on
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:57.840]  something like this.
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:01.360]  That's the truth guys if you ever get a chance anybody that's listening if you get a chance
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:06.640]  take a dab of some rosin before you diss it try the rosin tech yourself don't don't be a hater.
[02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:11.440]  So bro are you there you go how's the high is it similar to a normal dab?
[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:17.280]  Yeah I'd say it's uh it's strong I would compare it more to like uh
[02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:22.960]  uh IWE or like a a hash dab rather than a BHO dab for me.
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:26.080]  Do you get that heavy chested feeling like you do sometimes from a water dab
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:31.360]  or an IWE dab do you get a that heavy chested like thick feeling sometimes?
[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:35.280]  In my opinion it's the smoothest dab.
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:37.920]  Nice are you going to be in Denver for the Cannabis Cup?
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:45.840]  I'm still not 100% sure about the Denver Cup but uh we're gonna most likely be in
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:47.040]  Chalice this year.
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:50.640]  All right well if you were at the Denver Cup you better find me I'm a tall white guy with
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:52.160]  dreadlocks I would love you.
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:56.640]  For sure we'll definitely link we'll make that worth our time.
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:01.040]  Do you think you're gonna enter any uh contest or any cups or anything like that anytime soon bro?
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:09.360]  Um I think the the next cup going on is that we that we're gonna enter is Chalice
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:11.520]  we're setting up for we're starting to prepare for it.
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:13.040]  Nice you're gonna put rosin tech in there?
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:18.400]  Yeah definitely gonna see some uh salt and resin extracted oil um
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:21.920]  and then I'm hoping to have some ice wax in as well.
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:25.360]  Very cool I can't wait to see what the rosin tech does up next to
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:27.680]  uh ice wax and also up next to BHO.
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:31.440]  They'll probably make a category for it by the time that the event happens but
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:32.320]  I'm still excited to see it.
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:36.400]  I mean as far as I see I mean it's non-stop and I mean
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:39.280]  don't they throw the clear in that category?
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:44.080]  Yeah all right so you're gonna you're gonna be competing bro you'll be right up there
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:46.800]  with those guys I have faith in it from what I've seen people are loving it.
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:52.960]  And the fact is you know there's there's natural proteins whether it went through
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:57.120]  heat the process that it went just can't forget that it's solventless.
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:02.560]  You know I'm not I'm not big on smoking solvent with a solvent extract that's
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:05.120]  that's something that's in my mind I have for years.
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:08.880]  You know I'm not against it you know there's there's some very enjoyable
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:15.680]  extracts with some solvents but I just my preferred smoke is solventless.
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:17.920]  And a lot of people seem to turn in that way lately too.
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:23.760]  Yeah you know I see the clean meds movement going you know it's definitely picking up.
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:26.880]  Well thanks for supporting the clean meds movement bro we need more people like yourself
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:30.400]  that are aware of what we're doing for the community and to our bodies and with our medicine.
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:32.320]  That's cool I appreciate it and respect it a lot bro.
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:35.120]  Yeah for sure man.
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:38.080]  I'm gonna wrap up this phone interview I told you I'd only take about 15 minutes of your time
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:39.680]  we're getting pretty close to that.
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:41.360]  How can people find you on Instagram?
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:45.440]  On soilgrum so uh.
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:48.080]  So at soilgrum on Instagram.
[02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:54.720]  Yeah or hashtag soilgrum tech or I mean I don't really do too much of the hashtags
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:59.520]  for the soilgrum tech but uh you know you'll find you'll see the soilgrum just type in
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:02.240]  Rosentech and you'll definitely find soilgrum somewhere in there.
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:05.440]  There you go search for Rosentech on Instagram you'll definitely find this guy.
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:08.080]  But do you have any uh shout outs or anything you want to give or anything you want us to
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:10.960]  look at since you've got a lot of people listening to you something you want to say to the world?
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:17.760]  Uh I just I would just say don't knock it not don't knock it till you try it.
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:23.040]  Give it a shot just remember that it's clean meds and uh you know although it's a simple
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:27.600]  extraction process it does take a lot of work and you know it's a I would say I would call
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:30.320]  it a connoisseur's extract connoisseur's concentrate.
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:31.680]  Nice I like that.
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:34.240]  All right bro well I truly appreciate you calling in for the show man if you ever have
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:37.520]  anything else you want to say on the show you've got my phone number uh stay in touch
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:40.160]  with me if you're in Denver I look forward to meeting you at the cup man.
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:43.440]  Hey thanks thanks for uh giving me a shot Jeff.
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:46.880]  Oh thanks for thanks for being on the show man go take a dab of some Rosentech for me
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:49.440]  and I'll take a dab of some uh Turpex BHO for you.
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:51.040]  Definitely.
[02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:52.640]  Right on brother stay up take care of yourself.
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:54.320]  You too take care.
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:55.120]  Peace brother later.
[02:41:56.320 --> 02:41:58.240]  All right that was fun maybe that happened maybe it didn't.
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:04.000]  Maybe it did maybe it I don't know hopefully it did but uh this dude uh yeah you just heard
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.600]  what he said hopefully right maybe yeah that's a fun way to do a podcast.
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:14.000]  So uh Spence is heating me up one of these bounty killer live resin dabs off the mothership.
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:17.280]  I might not be able to talk for a couple seconds because Spence likes to wreck me.
[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:19.840]  Get ready.
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:22.480]  I'm ready bro I'm taking a drink I'm grabbing the dab.
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:26.080]  Spence holds on to the rig for a little bit of time because he knows I like to take
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:28.320]  dabs that are too hot which we call glowy's in this crew.
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:32.240]  They're not even like super glowy's but it's just hot.
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:36.080]  It's a little too hot I'll agree but I like the way uh I like the way I get the dab when
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:36.560]  it's that way.
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:41.360]  Clunk he's just smacking this mothership rig on the table like it's nothing.
[02:42:50.180 --> 02:42:51.220]  It sounds so cool.
[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:56.420]  Oh that's me getting super high right now is what that sound is.
[02:42:57.220 --> 02:43:00.900]  The sound of my brain is better it's like uh bubble wrap and fireworks.
[02:43:02.260 --> 02:43:03.380]  Like pop rocks.
[02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:07.540]  Pop rocks yeah my brain feels like pop rocks that's what I'm gonna say next time.
[02:43:08.980 --> 02:43:12.420]  What do you uh what do you think of the the raws and tech?
[02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:19.060]  Bro um I'm blown away by it um he's using equipment that everybody has or I've seen
[02:43:19.060 --> 02:43:23.380]  people use uh flat iron or I think black people call that a pressing comb don't they?
[02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:24.740]  It's not the same thing.
[02:43:24.740 --> 02:43:25.460]  A hot comb?
[02:43:25.460 --> 02:43:26.660]  Yeah yeah yeah.
[02:43:27.300 --> 02:43:28.020]  They're not the same.
[02:43:28.020 --> 02:43:29.220]  They're not the same all right.
[02:43:29.220 --> 02:43:32.900]  There's a girl that see on the one show that you're on on one show that you're on I said
[02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:34.420]  you're the only black person that's been in my house.
[02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:38.820]  I mean in Colorado I grew up in Southern California bro I had like all kinds of black
[02:43:38.820 --> 02:43:43.220]  folks on my block but this one girl Leticia she had she called it a flat iron or a straightening
[02:43:43.220 --> 02:43:45.700]  comb I thought it was the same shit but never mind.
[02:43:45.700 --> 02:43:46.260]  A flat iron?
[02:43:46.260 --> 02:43:47.220]  Maybe not.
[02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:48.100]  I don't know.
[02:43:48.100 --> 02:43:52.900]  But these guys are using shit that's around the house and handmade uh Adam Hand from Handmade
[02:43:52.900 --> 02:43:57.220]  Apparel he showed me his what he posted uh his slab because of course he had a t-shirt
[02:43:57.220 --> 02:44:02.260]  press already and he's like I got this game figured out and he's winning but I'm amazed
[02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:06.180]  that they're using shit that is just kind of around the house and making pearl you know
[02:44:06.180 --> 02:44:08.660]  solventless hash that is dabble blood.
[02:44:08.660 --> 02:44:09.140]  Yeah?
[02:44:09.140 --> 02:44:09.700]  Yeah.
[02:44:09.700 --> 02:44:17.540]  I haven't tried it yet um I actually I lied I tried um but I think it has more something
[02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:24.900]  to do with the moisture content of how your weed is dried like weed down here is really
[02:44:24.900 --> 02:44:29.380]  dry so it's just maybe I needed to do more pressure something like that.
[02:44:29.380 --> 02:44:29.880]  Yeah.
[02:44:30.580 --> 02:44:34.420]  Well we'll uh we'll talk to him here in a couple of days we'll spice that in so hopefully
[02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:38.260]  by the time hopefully by the time this airs we've got his part to piece in and you actually
[02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:42.180]  know because dude that Rosin tech is great and if just just I'm going to talk about it
[02:44:42.180 --> 02:44:45.220]  because I wanted to save it and let him talk about it but maybe we won't get his interview
[02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:50.260]  this dude's taking a t-shirt press and he's modified it and he puts a layer of parchment
[02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:56.100]  paper a little layer of buds and another parchment paper and squishes it for about four seconds
[02:44:56.100 --> 02:45:01.300]  and lifts it up pulls the parchment out he's got pretty much Earl's looks like VHO yeah
[02:45:01.300 --> 02:45:03.540]  slides the weed off into the floor and stomps on it all day.
[02:45:04.420 --> 02:45:09.140]  I know some people who I've seen some dude who has a tea jar and just once he's done
[02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:12.900]  with it he makes tea in the morning with it because it's still still got stuff in there

[02:46:53.780 --> 02:46:58.820]  these cups I'm just a solo grower so I don't have anybody backing up my girl when I go so it's hard
[02:46:58.820 --> 02:47:03.380]  to uh hard to get away for three or four days after that third day you start like I don't even
[02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:08.820]  when I had to go to Vegas for the secret I was like oh my god I need to go home somebody take
[02:47:08.820 --> 02:47:13.380]  me home yep let's just go first flight I need to get there check on the plants and then I'll
[02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:17.780]  fly back yeah yeah it's all it's about just gotta walk in the room make sure that everything's alive
[02:47:17.780 --> 02:47:23.940]  one time uh tweet me guys what do you do when you go out of town and you grow pot how do you keep
[02:47:23.940 --> 02:47:26.980]  your plants alive when you go out of town I'm just curious I know what to do I just want to know how
[02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:33.860]  you do it tweet me it's at gfyh podcast curious I want to know tell me what you do what um
[02:47:34.740 --> 02:47:41.700]  how's that uh your strain you're working on going so uh right before you came over tonight I was
[02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:47.140]  at the grow space taking pictures of like 20 different phenotypes of black cherry kim
[02:47:47.140 --> 02:47:52.260]  and I've narrowed it down there's one that is definitely a breeder uh it's purple it's got
[02:47:52.260 --> 02:47:58.580]  the great bud structure it smells like uh purple laffy taffy it's got a weird and you can smell it
[02:47:58.580 --> 02:48:03.860]  from far away it's got a weird overpowering aroma laffy taffy just like right I don't like
[02:48:03.860 --> 02:48:09.860]  grape laffy taffy it's coincidental black and I don't like grapes sorry I wasn't going there um
[02:48:10.900 --> 02:48:17.460]  but I do like laffy taffy they're so good so that flavor yeah yeah and the smell too I remember you
[02:48:17.460 --> 02:48:21.540]  can open a pack of laffy taffy and smell it before you even eat it and that's kind of how it is when
[02:48:21.540 --> 02:48:25.540]  I walked in the room and I I can smell that one plant all the time so I just single it out I was
[02:48:25.540 --> 02:48:29.300]  like this little bitch right here is going to be a winner and she happened to be one of the best
[02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:34.740]  purple phenotypes uh she grows a nice top cola nice structure so I'm going to use that one and
[02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:39.460]  then there's one uh that's a little lighter purple but has more of a chem dog sort of a smell
[02:48:40.020 --> 02:48:45.220]  so that one's going to be an option and there's one with no purple also or no purple at all but
[02:48:45.220 --> 02:48:52.740]  tons of trichomes tons of trikes and a great chemy kind of funky uh cherry resin-y kind of smell
[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:57.060]  so those three or four females are going to get put in the room with the black cherry male
[02:48:57.060 --> 02:49:00.420]  along with I got a couple other girls that are going to go in there I don't know if I even want
[02:49:00.420 --> 02:49:04.740]  to say what girls are going in there on the show because I got some great strain ideas I want to
[02:49:04.740 --> 02:49:10.820]  see what they do uh there will be some new black cherry crosses coming up uh then we'll have that
[02:49:10.820 --> 02:49:15.700]  breeding project won't happen till probably mid-summer maybe after the summer summer heat
[02:49:15.700 --> 02:49:20.420]  kind of kills some ideas around here yeah you got to shut down some things uh right now I've got
[02:49:21.060 --> 02:49:27.300]  golden goat a reverse golden goat male it's a female that's now a male in a room with some
[02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:31.940]  lemon skunks so there's more lemon jeffrey being made there's more golden goat seeds being made
[02:49:31.940 --> 02:49:36.100]  and I'm creating sunshine girl and I've also put gorilla glue in there so we'll have
[02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:41.940]  yeah gorilla glue golden goat we're gonna need a name for that and kind of tight there's an even
[02:49:41.940 --> 02:49:46.740]  like don't even like gold goat weed that might be tough golden when I cross anything to golden
[02:49:46.740 --> 02:49:52.020]  goat it makes it more resiny and gorilla glue is already resiny already so it's gonna be neat
[02:49:52.580 --> 02:49:56.740]  but uh there's also a plant in there a headband plant and I think I've told this story before
[02:49:56.740 --> 02:50:01.860]  the last time I pollinated a headband plant it died it died yeah so I put that bitch in there
[02:50:01.860 --> 02:50:06.260]  again we're gonna see what's up yeah we're gonna see if it just we just had a bad day or
[02:50:06.260 --> 02:50:10.100]  this is fucking yeah if there's something to that because I don't know what I did last time
[02:50:10.820 --> 02:50:15.060]  every other plant was happy she wasn't fucking with that last time take that bukkake very well
[02:50:15.460 --> 02:50:20.340]  or no and just shriveled up shriveled up uh you got any shout outs you want to give to anybody
