[00:02.110 --> 00:04.750]  Hey what's up podcast world, it's Rasta Jeff.
[00:04.750 --> 00:08.350]  I'm back and I'm doing that thing where I drop in a big chunk of old episodes.
[00:08.350 --> 00:13.750]  This time I'm doing episodes 13, 14, 15, and 16 of what used to be the I Grow Culture
[00:13.750 --> 00:17.270]  podcast which is now the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:17.270 --> 00:20.550]  Before we start the old episodes, let me make a couple of disclaimers.
[00:20.550 --> 00:25.350]  First off, if there are any advertisements, any offers, any promos in these episodes,
[00:25.350 --> 00:26.350]  that shit's all expired.
[00:26.350 --> 00:28.790]  Don't get too excited, that passed a long time ago.
[00:28.910 --> 00:33.110]  Also, all of the social media and contact information has changed.

[01:04.590 --> 01:07.270]  It's time for another episode of the I Grow Culture podcast.

[03:02.510 --> 03:12.110]  All right, before we go any further, I want to say thanks to a couple of people.
[03:12.110 --> 03:16.230]  I owe a huge thank you to Mr. Omnio from Twitter and also Rich Millehan from Facebook.
[03:16.230 --> 03:17.230]  Thanks guys.
[03:17.230 --> 03:18.630]  I'm really proud to have your support.
[03:18.630 --> 03:21.470]  I was looking for something on a Facebook feed and I couldn't find it.
[03:21.470 --> 03:23.830]  Spent about an hour searching through Facebook looking for it.
[03:23.830 --> 03:27.070]  I posted that I needed help and Rich found it in about 30 seconds.
[03:27.070 --> 03:28.150]  So thanks a lot, dude.
[03:28.150 --> 03:32.510]  And Mr. Omnio, you contribute to the show via Twitter whether you know it or not.
[03:32.510 --> 03:35.230]  I also want to send a huge thank you to everyone who's left comments on iTunes.
[03:35.230 --> 03:40.590]  I'm actually going to go read the iTunes comments to you right now.
[03:40.590 --> 03:43.710]  The first one says, nice find by toddddd.
[03:43.710 --> 03:47.230]  That's T-O-D-D-D-D, Todd with a bunch of Ds.
[03:47.230 --> 03:49.550]  Todd says, I really like the tone of the show.
[03:49.550 --> 03:51.430]  It's never too serious and never boring.
[03:51.430 --> 03:53.950]  I laugh and learn and laugh again.
[03:53.950 --> 03:55.150]  Well, awesome, dude.
[03:55.150 --> 03:56.150]  That's kind of what I'm aiming for.
[03:56.150 --> 03:58.990]  I like to make people learn and making you laugh is just a bonus.
[03:58.990 --> 03:59.990]  I'm kind of a goofy dude.
[03:59.990 --> 04:01.270]  So glad that comes across.
[04:01.270 --> 04:02.270]  Thanks, bro.
[04:02.270 --> 04:05.270]  The next one is awesome by Llama Box.
[04:05.270 --> 04:08.350]  Llama Box, that's a cool ass name, dude.
[04:08.350 --> 04:12.470]  He says, loving the show, telling about the culture from the front lines.
[04:12.470 --> 04:13.470]  That's it, dude.
[04:13.470 --> 04:14.470]  That's our job.
[04:14.470 --> 04:16.150]  It's what we got to do.
[04:16.150 --> 04:19.510]  The next comment is from our friend Logistics.
[04:19.510 --> 04:24.270]  He says, great listen, great podcast, always fun listening to Jeff's stories on cannabis.
[04:24.270 --> 04:27.950]  Wish I learned about this podcast sooner and met the man himself during my short trip to
[04:27.950 --> 04:28.950]  Colorado.
[04:28.950 --> 04:29.950]  Don't worry, bro.
[04:29.950 --> 04:30.950]  You'll be back to Colorado.
[04:30.950 --> 04:31.950]  You'll get to meet me.
[04:31.950 --> 04:32.950]  We'll get to hang out.
[04:32.950 --> 04:33.950]  I go to all the cannabis events.
[04:33.950 --> 04:34.950]  I got a dab for you.
[04:34.950 --> 04:35.950]  Don't worry.
[04:35.950 --> 04:37.950]  Shout out to all the people that left comments on iTunes.
[04:37.950 --> 04:38.950]  Thanks, guys.
[04:38.950 --> 04:42.790]  If you leave comments on iTunes, I'll try to read it on the show.
[04:42.790 --> 04:46.830]  I'll also find the comments on Stitcher and read those on a future episode.
[04:46.830 --> 04:47.830]  Stitcher is kind of weird.
[04:47.830 --> 04:49.150]  They don't put the comments all in one spot.
[04:49.150 --> 04:50.150]  They spread them around.
[04:50.150 --> 04:52.110]  They stay on each episode.
[04:52.110 --> 04:57.210]  So unless I go search back through the episodes, I won't find them.
[04:57.210 --> 05:01.350]  If you don't want to leave a comment on iTunes or Stitcher, you can send me a tweet at iGrowCulture
[05:01.350 --> 05:04.350]  or of course you can find me on Facebook and I'll respond to you there.
[05:04.750 --> 05:08.030]  If you want to say something anonymously, you can always send me a personal message
[05:08.030 --> 05:09.230]  and I will keep your name private.
[05:09.230 --> 05:11.310]  I won't bust you out on the air.
[05:11.310 --> 05:13.110]  I won't say your name if you ask me not to.
[05:13.110 --> 05:14.110]  All right.
[05:14.110 --> 05:18.390]  Now I want to send mad love to everyone at the Garden of Whedon.
[05:18.390 --> 05:19.390]  What's up, guys?
[05:19.390 --> 05:22.710]  You guys are my home away from home, my family away from family, and I'm proud to be part
[05:22.710 --> 05:23.710]  of your circle.
[05:23.710 --> 05:25.030]  I'm honored to call each of you my friends.
[05:25.030 --> 05:26.030]  Much respect.
[05:26.030 --> 05:29.310]  Unfortunately, the Garden of Whedon lost a brother recently.
[05:29.310 --> 05:31.390]  He was taken from us tragically.
[05:31.390 --> 05:35.110]  So I'd like to take a minute and say goodbye to Danny.
[05:35.110 --> 05:36.110]  Love you, bro.
[05:36.110 --> 05:37.110]  Miss you.
[05:37.110 --> 05:39.710]  I'm going to read a beautiful post that was written by our friend, Maddie.
[05:39.710 --> 05:40.710]  All right.
[05:40.710 --> 05:43.510]  This post says, and I may tear up because he was a cool bro.
[05:43.510 --> 05:46.790]  It says, we've lost a great brother and part of our crew.
[05:46.790 --> 05:49.750]  Living and experiencing Colorado with you and your family has been a blessing to all
[05:49.750 --> 05:50.750]  of us.
[05:50.750 --> 05:54.230]  Danny always had so much positive energy and brought so much fun to our lives.
[05:54.230 --> 05:57.910]  It's going to be so strange not having you walk in the front door with a yellow vitamin
[05:57.910 --> 06:00.470]  water and dad bag in hand.
[06:00.550 --> 06:02.310]  My heart's go out to you and your family.
[06:02.310 --> 06:03.310]  We all love you and miss you.
[06:03.310 --> 06:06.590]  We will all grind that much harder for you, bro.
[06:06.590 --> 06:10.030]  Hashtag country bearded dabbers.
[06:10.030 --> 06:13.350]  Country bearded dabbers was something that Danny and a few friends came up with.
[06:13.350 --> 06:16.070]  Yeah, they're the North Carolina boys.
[06:16.070 --> 06:18.070]  Danny was always a cool dude.
[06:18.070 --> 06:20.110]  He was kind of a friend of a friend, if you know what I mean.
[06:20.110 --> 06:23.990]  Like I was introduced to him by the Garden of Whedon crew, but from the first time I
[06:23.990 --> 06:26.390]  met him, he treated me just like I was one of the bros.
[06:26.390 --> 06:28.430]  So, you know, always a cool dude.
[06:28.430 --> 06:29.430]  Big shout out.
[06:29.430 --> 06:30.430]  Much respect.
[06:30.430 --> 06:33.790]  I'm going to take a fat dab for Danny and we'll be back with the rest of the show.
[06:33.790 --> 06:38.030]  All right, now back with the news.
[06:38.030 --> 06:40.310]  We've got some good news to report this week.
[06:40.310 --> 06:43.470]  This article comes from Vox.com.
[06:43.470 --> 06:46.230]  Vox explains everything you need to know in two minutes.
[06:46.230 --> 06:47.990]  So I got two minutes.
[06:47.990 --> 06:52.790]  This article is written by German Lopez and it was written on May 30th.
[06:52.790 --> 06:58.030]  The article says the US House of Representatives late Thursday passed a measure that would
[06:58.030 --> 07:03.430]  prohibit the federal government from interfering with state's medical marijuana laws.
[07:03.430 --> 07:07.150]  This bill is the first time in history that any chamber of commerce has acted to protect
[07:07.150 --> 07:09.550]  medical marijuana businesses and users.
[07:09.550 --> 07:11.910]  It also got bipartisan support.
[07:11.910 --> 07:17.030]  170 Democrats and 49 Republicans voted in favor of the bill.
[07:17.030 --> 07:20.990]  The measure was attached to a funding bill for several federal agencies and it blocks
[07:20.990 --> 07:25.510]  the Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration from using funds to prevent
[07:25.510 --> 07:29.150]  states from implementing their own medical marijuana laws.
[07:29.150 --> 07:33.510]  The measure, however, will require approval from the Senate and President Barack Obama.
[07:33.510 --> 07:38.910]  The Senate is expected to pass its own funding bill so the medical marijuana amendment will
[07:38.910 --> 07:44.350]  need to survive through both chambers' reconciliation process and then obtain Obama's signature
[07:44.350 --> 07:45.350]  to become law.
[07:45.350 --> 07:50.390]  So we're two steps away from getting these fuckers to quit fucking with us and letting
[07:50.390 --> 07:54.390]  us do business and grow our herb and take care of our patients and do what we need to do.
[07:54.390 --> 07:58.270]  I don't want to rattle the cage too much.
[07:58.270 --> 08:03.670]  So the article says still, marijuana legalization advocates praise the House's decision.
[08:03.670 --> 08:07.870]  Congress is officially pulling out of the war on medical marijuana patients and providers.
[08:07.870 --> 08:11.430]  Federal tax dollars will no longer be wasted arresting seriously ill medical marijuana
[08:11.430 --> 08:13.510]  patients and those who provide to them.
[08:13.510 --> 08:18.390]  Dan Riffle, Director of Federal Policies at the Marijuana Policy Project said in a statement,
[08:18.390 --> 08:22.430]  This is a historic vote and it's yet another sign that our federal government is shifting
[08:22.430 --> 08:25.630]  toward a more sensible marijuana policy.
[08:25.630 --> 08:29.070]  The vote, while historic and a bit surprising even to advocates, is part of the federal
[08:29.070 --> 08:33.510]  government's ongoing shift toward more liberal marijuana policies.
[08:33.510 --> 08:38.830]  Just a few weeks ago, the feds increased how much marijuana can be grown for medical research.
[08:38.830 --> 08:42.870]  President Barack Obama and his administration have taken steps to mitigate prosecutions
[08:42.870 --> 08:47.270]  against marijuana businesses that operate illegally under state laws.
[08:47.270 --> 08:50.990]  Marijuana advocates in previous interviews have said that this is the logical progression
[08:50.990 --> 08:55.750]  for marijuana policy as popular opinion shifts in favor of legalizing the drug, and more
[08:55.750 --> 08:59.650]  states begin to seriously consider fully legalizing marijuana.
[08:59.650 --> 09:05.270]  As more congressional leaders gain more constituents that legally use marijuana for recreational
[09:05.270 --> 09:11.590]  and medical purposes, they will face increasing pressure to relax their stance on the drug.
[09:11.590 --> 09:14.850]  Still, legalization advocates have their work cut out for them.
[09:14.850 --> 09:18.090]  Marijuana is still illegal under federal law and considered a more dangerous drug than
[09:18.090 --> 09:21.530]  cocaine and meth under the DEA's scheduling system.
[09:21.530 --> 09:25.210]  As a result, banks don't have enough faith in marijuana businesses to let them open bank
[09:25.210 --> 09:30.290]  accounts, which forces pot shops and cultivators to run as risky cash-only enterprises.
[09:30.290 --> 09:33.250]  We've talked about that a little bit on the show.
[09:33.250 --> 09:38.170]  So as it stands, we are only two steps away from the federal government stopping raiding
[09:38.170 --> 09:43.850]  patients, providers, and dispensaries for marijuana production and possession.
[09:43.850 --> 09:47.890]  Maybe once we get to that point, the banks will start accepting our funds and the dispensaries
[09:47.890 --> 09:50.450]  will start being taken seriously like businesses.
[09:50.450 --> 09:53.490]  We can only hope, right?
[09:53.490 --> 09:57.450]  Here's another article involving the feds and some of their silliness.
[09:57.450 --> 10:02.770]  I looked all over for this article for information on who wrote it and there's no author given
[10:02.770 --> 10:03.770]  here.
[10:03.770 --> 10:07.050]  I can't give you credit for your homework if you don't write your name on your paper.
[10:07.050 --> 10:10.090]  It does come from the Huffington Post Politics section.
[10:10.330 --> 10:14.970]  It actually says, Feds Block Water for State Legal Marijuana Grows.
[10:14.970 --> 10:18.410]  I'm going to repeat that.
[10:18.410 --> 10:21.610]  Feds Block Water for State Legal Marijuana Grows.
[10:21.610 --> 10:26.690]  The article says, an agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior announced Tuesday
[10:26.690 --> 10:31.330]  that state legal marijuana grows are banned from using federal water on their crops.
[10:31.330 --> 10:36.330]  As a federal agency, reclamation is obligated to adhere to federal law and the conduct of
[10:36.330 --> 10:39.010]  its responsibilities to the American people.
[10:39.010 --> 10:42.770]  This is what the U.S. Department of the Interior said to Dan DuBray, Public Affairs Chief for
[10:42.770 --> 10:48.290]  the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees management of federal water resources.
[10:48.290 --> 10:52.050]  Reclamation will operate its facilities and administer its water-related contracts in
[10:52.050 --> 10:57.490]  a manner that is consistent with the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as amended, DuBray
[10:57.490 --> 10:58.490]  went on.
[10:58.490 --> 11:02.490]  This includes locations where state law has decriminalized or authorized the cultivation
[11:02.490 --> 11:04.290]  of marijuana.
[11:04.290 --> 11:08.250]  Reclamation will refer any inconsistent uses of federal resources of which it becomes aware
[11:08.250 --> 11:13.090]  to the Department of Justice and coordinate with the proper enforcement authorities.
[11:13.090 --> 11:16.810]  Reclamation will continue to work with partner water districts and providers to ensure their
[11:16.810 --> 11:20.810]  important obligations continue to be met.
[11:20.810 --> 11:25.130]  Now that federal water is banned for marijuana growing, should a Reclamation employee be
[11:25.130 --> 11:29.210]  aware that Bureau resources are being used to facilitate the cultivation of cannabis,
[11:29.210 --> 11:33.170]  that employee will be expected to bring it to the attention of his or her regional director,
[11:33.170 --> 11:38.050]  who will report such use to the Department of Justice and document the reporting actions,
[11:38.050 --> 11:42.050]  according to the temporary policy posted on the USBR website.
[11:42.050 --> 11:51.250]  Ah, so if an employee of the Reclamation Department finds that you're using water to grow some
[11:51.250 --> 11:55.050]  weed, they're supposed to report to the Department of Justice.
[11:55.050 --> 11:58.050]  Man, whatever.
[11:58.050 --> 12:02.450]  So currently, 21 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical
[12:02.450 --> 12:04.050]  purposes.
[12:04.050 --> 12:07.810]  Recreational marijuana is now legal in Colorado and Washington State, and about a dozen other
[12:07.810 --> 12:10.810]  states are considering legalization in the coming years.
[12:10.810 --> 12:14.810]  Still, the federal government continues to ban the plant, classifying it as Schedule
[12:14.810 --> 12:17.810]  1 substance alongside heroin and LSD.
[12:17.810 --> 12:23.810]  If we get our way pretty soon here, we got two more steps and we may see some change.
[12:23.810 --> 12:27.810]  Maybe they'll give us our water back when Obama tells them to stop raiding all the legal
[12:27.810 --> 12:29.810]  growers and growth facilities.
[12:29.810 --> 12:33.810]  There's actually a dispensary in Pueblo West that's suffering right now because their water
[12:33.810 --> 12:35.810]  has been turned off.
[12:35.810 --> 12:40.810]  I called them and tried to get in touch with them, but they did not respond.
[12:40.810 --> 12:42.810]  All right, let's read another article.
[12:42.810 --> 12:45.810]  Our next article actually comes from Pueblo, Colorado.
[12:45.810 --> 12:48.810]  It's in the Pueblo Chieftain.
[12:48.810 --> 12:52.810]  The article was written by Peter Roper.
[12:52.810 --> 12:55.810]  That's a fucking porn name if I ever heard one.
[12:55.810 --> 12:59.810]  All right, the article is headlined,
[13:00.810 --> 13:06.810]  Pueblo City Council, no to making hash, no agreement on where pot should be smoked.
[13:06.810 --> 13:09.810]  Making hash oil will be illegal in Pueblo.
[13:09.810 --> 13:13.810]  That's one decision City Council didn't have trouble with Tuesday night as it wrangled
[13:13.810 --> 13:17.810]  over some simple and some complicated questions about allowing the use of recreational marijuana
[13:17.810 --> 13:18.810]  in the city.
[13:18.810 --> 13:23.810]  Hash oil, by the way, is a potent cannabis concentrate that is made with butane, a flammable
[13:23.810 --> 13:27.810]  gas that has caused exploding houses in Colorado Springs and elsewhere.
[13:27.810 --> 13:32.810]  Council collectively shook their heads no Tuesday night after Assistant City Attorney
[13:32.810 --> 13:37.810]  Carla Sykes explained some of the hazards of hash oil during the weekly work session.
[13:37.810 --> 13:42.810]  But the tougher question, should city residents be able to smoke pot on their front porches
[13:42.810 --> 13:44.810]  or in their yards did not get resolved.
[13:44.810 --> 13:48.810]  Although the city doesn't allow the sale of recreational pot, council is trying to
[13:48.810 --> 13:52.810]  give city residents guidance on how they can legally use in the city.
[13:52.810 --> 13:57.810]  I want to mention that there are dispensaries like five miles outside of the city limits
[13:57.810 --> 14:01.810]  in Pueblo West and Pueblo County and just south of Stem Beach.
[14:01.810 --> 14:03.810]  So they're five or ten minutes away.
[14:03.810 --> 14:05.810]  It's not like we don't have access to it.
[14:05.810 --> 14:08.810]  They just don't allow it right inside city limits, which we have talked about, which
[14:08.810 --> 14:09.810]  we find silly.
[14:09.810 --> 14:10.810]  So we'll continue.
[14:10.810 --> 14:16.810]  Councilman Steve Narocki, oh, Councilman Steve Narocki and Ed Brown, as well as Councilwoman
[14:16.810 --> 14:20.810]  Amy Narocki all spoke up for letting people use, legally use marijuana anywhere on their
[14:20.810 --> 14:23.810]  property, just like smoking cigarettes or drinking beer.
[14:23.810 --> 14:25.810]  We just have to trust people to use their best judgment.
[14:25.810 --> 14:27.810]  Steve Narocki contended.
[14:27.810 --> 14:31.810]  Council President Sandy Daff responded by underlining her opposition to letting people
[14:31.810 --> 14:33.810]  use pot in their front yards.
[14:33.810 --> 14:36.810]  My community deserves better than this, she said.
[14:36.810 --> 14:40.810]  Sykes explained how other Colorado cities such as Arvada and Boulder restrict the use
[14:40.810 --> 14:43.810]  of recreational pot to backyards and enclosed yards.
[14:43.810 --> 14:47.810]  I'm kind of offended by the statement that she said my community deserves better than
[14:47.810 --> 14:48.810]  this.
[14:48.810 --> 14:51.810]  What's wrong with me sitting on my porch on a nice summer day?
[14:51.810 --> 14:56.810]  I sit out there and I play with my damn phone in the sunshine.
[14:56.810 --> 15:00.810]  I know that's ridiculous, but I watch traffic and I cool off and just let my thoughts wander
[15:00.810 --> 15:01.810]  for a minute.
[15:01.810 --> 15:04.810]  Sometimes I put the phone away and just, I'd like to be able to just smoke a joint without
[15:04.810 --> 15:05.810]  anybody bitching at me.
[15:05.810 --> 15:08.810]  I don't do it because I don't want to bring any attention to myself, but I wish I could
[15:08.810 --> 15:10.810]  do it without anybody just bitching.
[15:10.810 --> 15:13.810]  And I know I'm the white guy with dreadlocks.
[15:13.810 --> 15:15.810]  I'd be the perfect target for them to come fuck with.
[15:15.810 --> 15:17.810]  So I just don't do that.
[15:17.810 --> 15:19.810]  We deserve better than this.
[15:19.810 --> 15:20.810]  We voted this in.
[15:20.810 --> 15:22.810]  We voted to be able to use cannabis.
[15:22.810 --> 15:24.810]  We voted for it to be recreational.
[15:24.810 --> 15:28.810]  We should feel free as adults to smoke where we feel like we can smoke.
[15:28.810 --> 15:30.810]  All right, I got to take a quick drink.
[15:30.810 --> 15:31.810]  I'm all choked up from a jab.
[15:31.810 --> 15:33.810]  Hold on for one second.
[15:33.810 --> 15:38.550]  All right.
[15:38.550 --> 15:41.550]  Front yards and walks are essentially public, she said.
[15:41.550 --> 15:44.550]  And Amendment 64 does not allow the public use of marijuana.
[15:44.550 --> 15:49.550]  Denver does allow open use in yards and Steve Narocki said he wants the city staff to bring
[15:49.550 --> 15:52.550]  forward an ordinance that starts with the Denver language.
[15:52.550 --> 15:55.550]  If there are votes to change it, they can amend it, he said.
[15:55.550 --> 15:58.550]  He was referring to DAF.
[15:58.550 --> 16:03.550]  Councilman Chris Kaufman, Councilwoman Eva Montoya and Councilman Chris Nickel, who have
[16:03.550 --> 16:06.550]  all challenged recreational pot in one way or another.
[16:06.550 --> 16:10.550]  There are some decisions about whether to allow marijuana clubs.
[16:10.550 --> 16:14.550]  If pot is legal for recreational purposes, why shouldn't there be clubs allowed where
[16:14.550 --> 16:16.550]  people can use it together?
[16:16.550 --> 16:19.550]  But the general consensus on council leaned against that.
[16:19.550 --> 16:23.550]  The major reason was the challenge of having city police or firefighters respond to incidents
[16:23.550 --> 16:29.550]  at such a club where they might have prolonged contact with marijuana smoke that could affect
[16:29.550 --> 16:30.550]  their job performance.
[16:30.550 --> 16:34.550]  I know I laughed through that because I read it, it got fucking silly to me.
[16:34.550 --> 16:37.550]  I'm going to try to read through that shit again without laughing at you guys.
[16:37.550 --> 16:42.550]  The major reason was the challenge of having city police or firefighters respond to incidents
[16:42.550 --> 16:47.550]  at such a club where they might have prolonged contact with marijuana smoke that could affect
[16:47.550 --> 16:48.550]  their job performance.
[16:48.550 --> 16:53.550]  So one of the reasons they're trying to stop us from having a recreational smoke lounge
[16:53.550 --> 16:58.550]  here at Pueblo, Colorado, is because they're afraid if the cops or the firefighters have
[16:58.550 --> 17:03.550]  to go there, they will have prolonged contact with marijuana smoke that could affect their
[17:03.550 --> 17:04.550]  job performance.
[17:04.550 --> 17:07.550]  That's some bullshit.
[17:07.550 --> 17:08.550]  That's over worrying.
[17:08.550 --> 17:10.550]  How long do you think they're going to be in there?
[17:10.550 --> 17:12.550]  How smoky do you think it's going to be?
[17:12.550 --> 17:14.550]  Chill the fuck out.
[17:14.550 --> 17:20.550]  I was actually asked recently to be on the council that's going to write the rules, the
[17:20.550 --> 17:24.550]  proposed rules to get a recreational shop opened here in my neighborhood.
[17:24.550 --> 17:27.550]  Actually, people that are opening it don't even realize I live right by them.
[17:27.550 --> 17:32.550]  They came to me, they said that the council is going to stop it from being possible if
[17:32.550 --> 17:37.550]  we don't proactively try to write rules and propose it to make it happen.
[17:37.550 --> 17:41.550]  I think this is the announcement right here where I said I am going to do that because
[17:41.550 --> 17:42.550]  it was up in the air still.
[17:42.550 --> 17:43.550]  I think I'm going to participate and help them out.
[17:43.550 --> 17:44.550]  They need my help.
[17:44.550 --> 17:46.550]  They need somebody that knows what's going on.
[17:46.550 --> 17:49.550]  And in this area, that seems to be me.
[17:49.550 --> 17:50.550]  All right.
[17:50.550 --> 17:53.550]  I think that's enough news for the day.
[17:53.550 --> 17:58.550]  I am going to take a dab and grab another sip of something.
[17:58.550 --> 18:02.550]  And we'll come up with the first grow lesson after that.
[18:02.550 --> 18:04.550]  And we're going to germinate some seeds.
[18:04.550 --> 18:06.550]  And we'll talk about that.
[18:06.550 --> 18:07.550]  Here we go.
[18:07.550 --> 18:08.550]  Give me a second.
[18:12.550 --> 18:16.550]  While I'm taking a quick dab, you guys should check out TreeThugger.com.
[18:16.550 --> 18:18.550]  www.treethugger.com.
[18:21.550 --> 18:22.550]  All right, guys.
[18:22.550 --> 18:23.550]  We are back.
[18:23.550 --> 18:26.550]  It's time to give you a quick lesson on germinating seeds.
[18:26.550 --> 18:30.550]  But I want to read a little post that I made on Facebook a long time ago.
[18:30.550 --> 18:31.550]  And it's still relevant.
[18:31.550 --> 18:34.550]  It says, I'm asked dozens of grow questions every day.
[18:34.550 --> 18:39.550]  Let me give everyone my first piece of advice to anyone who wants to start growing cannabis on any scale.
[18:39.550 --> 18:44.550]  If you want to grow enough medicine for yourself or if you want to supply North America with your buds,
[18:44.550 --> 18:46.550]  this is my first piece of advice.
[18:46.550 --> 18:51.550]  Before you ever order a seed or purchase a clone, before you even walk into the hydro shop,
[18:51.550 --> 18:54.550]  before you open a catalog to see what kind of nutrients you want to use,
[18:54.550 --> 18:59.550]  I recommend buying yourself a good grow book from a reputable grower author.
[18:59.550 --> 19:05.550]  I recommend Ed Rosenthal's Marijuana Grower's Handbook or Jorge Cervantes' Marijuana Horticulture,
[19:05.550 --> 19:06.550]  the Medical Grower's Bible.
[19:06.550 --> 19:08.550]  Of course, I've recommended both of those on the show before.
[19:08.550 --> 19:14.550]  If you need a simple step-by-step guide, pick up Let's Grow a Pound by Seymour Buds.
[19:14.550 --> 19:20.550]  Once you have a nice knowledge base, take a look at Dr. Robert Cullen Clark's Marijuana Botany
[19:20.550 --> 19:23.550]  or Greg Green's Cannabis Breeders Bible.
[19:23.550 --> 19:26.550]  There's a plethora of knowledge in each of these books.
[19:26.550 --> 19:31.550]  If you read and study before you start a garden, you'll have a better understanding of how to build your grow space,
[19:31.550 --> 19:35.550]  what to plan for during the grow, which types of genetics you want to grow,
[19:35.550 --> 19:37.550]  and a good plan for preventing problems.
[19:37.550 --> 19:39.550]  Problems will arise during your grow.
[19:39.550 --> 19:45.550]  If you read about the possibilities, you'll have a better eye for spotting problems before they get out of control.
[19:45.550 --> 19:50.550]  You'll also save a ton of money by not buying unnecessary equipment or products aimed at new growers.
[19:50.550 --> 19:52.550]  Oh, this is just me interjecting.
[19:52.550 --> 19:56.550]  When you go to the grow shop, they put all kinds of cool shit at the front of the store.
[19:56.550 --> 20:00.550]  It's just like when you go to any store. Those are impulse buys. It's shit that you don't really need.
[20:00.550 --> 20:04.550]  They just want you to pick that up and spend a few extra bucks.
[20:04.550 --> 20:08.550]  Sorry to bust out the grow shops like that, but that's their job. They need to take your money.
[20:08.550 --> 20:11.550]  So, make sure you need something before you buy it.
[20:11.550 --> 20:15.550]  Just because it's shiny or flashy or has a new light on it, don't buy that.
[20:15.550 --> 20:17.550]  So save your money.
[20:17.550 --> 20:20.550]  A good book will be the best 20 bucks you could spend on your garden,
[20:20.550 --> 20:23.550]  but it will only be useful if you take your time to read it.
[20:23.550 --> 20:25.550]  Don't be afraid to make notes in your books.
[20:25.550 --> 20:29.550]  You should see some of my favorite grow books. They look like they're beat to shit.
[20:29.550 --> 20:31.550]  They've been through battles.
[20:31.550 --> 20:33.550]  There are book markers in them.
[20:33.550 --> 20:35.550]  They're written on. They're highlighted.
[20:35.550 --> 20:38.550]  But anyway, that's my best advice for any grower.
[20:38.550 --> 20:41.550]  There are people on the internet who love to give new growers advice,
[20:41.550 --> 20:45.550]  but how do you know that they have any real education or experience?
[20:45.550 --> 20:47.550]  I've seen tons of bad advice online.
[20:47.550 --> 20:49.550]  Don't let a stranger ruin your crop.
[20:50.550 --> 20:53.550]  The first step is to learn about your plants and patience before you build a grow room.
[20:53.550 --> 20:55.550]  Once you understand what you're getting into,
[20:55.550 --> 21:00.550]  set some type of goals for your grow.
[21:00.550 --> 21:03.550]  How many people are you supplying?
[21:03.550 --> 21:05.550]  How much do you smoke every three months?
[21:05.550 --> 21:09.550]  How do you produce enough herb to supply those people and cover your costs?
[21:09.550 --> 21:12.550]  And how can you do this all discreetly and safely?
[21:12.550 --> 21:15.550]  You have to buy everything somewhere,
[21:15.550 --> 21:17.550]  and you have to get it all into your house
[21:17.550 --> 21:20.550]  without neighbors seeing your new lights and your new CO2 setup.
[21:20.550 --> 21:23.550]  Have fun sneaking that hydro table into your house.
[21:23.550 --> 21:28.550]  After your crop is complete, you'll have a bunch of soil and or sticks to get rid of.
[21:28.550 --> 21:31.550]  If you're running hydro, you don't have as much soil to get rid of,
[21:31.550 --> 21:35.550]  but if you're running soil crops or soilless medium, there's a lot of shit to get rid of.
[21:35.550 --> 21:37.550]  Where's all that stuff going to go?
[21:37.550 --> 21:40.550]  Are you going to put it out with your trash by the curb?
[21:40.550 --> 21:43.550]  You'll have enough to think about while your grow is happening.
[21:43.550 --> 21:47.550]  A little reading and preparation before you start will make your grow much more enjoyable
[21:47.550 --> 21:49.550]  and much more relaxing experience.
[21:49.550 --> 21:52.550]  Grow from your heart and the plants will reflect your work.
[21:52.550 --> 21:55.550]  So, get prepared.
[21:55.550 --> 21:59.550]  If you're going to grow some weed, my first piece of advice to everybody is get prepared.
[21:59.550 --> 22:03.550]  Understand what you're getting into, because a lot of people think they're going to start this little closet grow.
[22:03.550 --> 22:07.550]  They got their seeds going, and they're living week to week with their grow,
[22:07.550 --> 22:10.550]  which is almost disrespectful and embarrassing to your plants.
[22:10.550 --> 22:12.550]  You're not going to grow good weed like that.
[22:12.550 --> 22:17.550]  I try to be a good four weeks ahead of myself, which sometimes I do get ahead of myself, literally.
[22:17.550 --> 22:19.550]  But I try to have a plan.
[22:19.550 --> 22:22.550]  I know when this clone is being cut, I know when it's going to flower.
[22:22.550 --> 22:24.550]  Generally, I have a good idea.
[22:24.550 --> 22:27.550]  So, have a good idea of what you're trying to do.
[22:27.550 --> 22:30.550]  Have the equipment in advance, have the nutrients in advance,
[22:30.550 --> 22:32.550]  because things sneak up on you when you're growing weed.
[22:32.550 --> 22:34.550]  You get distracted by life.
[22:34.550 --> 22:36.550]  You have to be kind of secretive about your grow in some cases.
[22:36.550 --> 22:39.550]  So, you can't always do things at the ideal times.
[22:39.550 --> 22:42.550]  It's easier to try to get to things a little sooner than later.
[22:42.550 --> 22:44.550]  So, your crop is at stake here.
[22:44.550 --> 22:46.550]  Love your plants. You've got to love those plants.
[22:46.550 --> 22:50.550]  You wouldn't push off the new, whatever you're into, the new Jordans.
[22:50.550 --> 22:53.550]  You're going to go buy those today. Why don't you take care of your plants today also?
[22:55.550 --> 22:58.550]  Get prepared. Sorry, I had to clear my throat. There are so many dads.
[22:58.550 --> 23:02.550]  So, before you germinate your seeds, have a good plan of what you're going to do with them in a few days,
[23:02.550 --> 23:04.550]  in a few weeks, and all the way through flowering.
[23:04.550 --> 23:06.550]  Don't skip any steps.
[23:06.550 --> 23:08.550]  Don't think about harvesting and selling that crop.
[23:08.550 --> 23:11.550]  Don't even think about that yet, because you've got to think about getting it going.
[23:13.550 --> 23:18.550]  Before you germinate your seeds, I totally recommend you have cups or pots for baby plants
[23:18.550 --> 23:21.550]  to live in for about two weeks to a month, or maybe even to finish in.
[23:21.550 --> 23:23.550]  You're going to need some soil.
[23:23.550 --> 23:25.550]  Today, I actually went and bought some Light Warrior soil.
[23:25.550 --> 23:28.550]  I like Light Warrior and Happy Frog for my babies.
[23:28.550 --> 23:33.550]  You'll need basic nutrients and maybe some root inoculants in about a week or two.
[23:33.550 --> 23:37.550]  Another good piece of advice is to try to use good seeds if you can.
[23:37.550 --> 23:41.550]  Bag seed is fine. I mean, chem dog was bag seed, you know.
[23:41.550 --> 23:46.550]  But it's less reliable and less predictable, so try to use seeds from a reliable breeder if possible.
[23:46.550 --> 23:50.550]  Knowing what you're growing with will make your job much easier in the long run.
[23:50.550 --> 23:53.550]  If you need seeds, check out naturesgreenremedies.com.
[23:53.550 --> 23:57.550]  They're actually in the States, so you don't have to worry about customs taking your seeds
[23:57.550 --> 24:00.550]  or you getting a yellow package with green tape across the front of it.
[24:01.550 --> 24:07.550]  Natures Green Remedies also uses priority mail, so your package will arrive in just a few short days.
[24:07.550 --> 24:13.550]  To germinate, you're going to need some paper towels, a marker, a plate, some water.
[24:13.550 --> 24:17.550]  Plain tap water is cool, but bottled water is better, in my opinion.
[24:17.550 --> 24:19.550]  You'll be just fine with either.
[24:19.550 --> 24:21.550]  You'll want the water at room temp.
[24:21.550 --> 24:25.550]  Grab all the things you need, and we'll germinate some seeds together.
[24:25.550 --> 24:29.550]  I'm actually going to germinate some seeds while we're on the show right now.
[24:29.550 --> 24:32.550]  I'm going to start three seeds with you guys right now.
[24:32.550 --> 24:34.550]  I'm actually going to start...
[24:34.550 --> 24:37.550]  These are something I just bred. I haven't germinated any of these.
[24:37.550 --> 24:40.550]  Nobody's seen these before. These are actually called...
[24:40.550 --> 24:43.550]  It's grateful daw. It's blue dream.
[24:43.550 --> 24:44.550]  A blue dream...
[24:44.550 --> 24:45.550]  Here's a quick tip.
[24:45.550 --> 24:49.550]  When you're listing genetics, put the female first, like ladies first.
[24:49.550 --> 24:50.550]  Try to remember that.
[24:50.550 --> 24:53.550]  If you're crossing strains, the girl strain goes first.
[24:53.550 --> 24:54.550]  The male strain comes after that.
[24:54.550 --> 24:56.550]  So ladies first all the time when you list genetics.
[24:56.550 --> 24:58.550]  That's just common practice.
[24:58.550 --> 25:01.550]  This is blue dream crossed to the grateful daw.
[25:01.550 --> 25:03.550]  It's a feminized seed.
[25:03.550 --> 25:04.550]  I reversed the grateful daw.
[25:04.550 --> 25:07.550]  I used that reversed pollen, threw that onto the blue dream.
[25:07.550 --> 25:11.550]  I've created a strain that I would like to call blue healer if it proves successful.
[25:11.550 --> 25:13.550]  I'm going to germinate some of these right now.
[25:13.550 --> 25:15.550]  We're going to do two to three of them.
[25:15.550 --> 25:17.550]  I don't have room for a lot of extra plants right now.
[25:17.550 --> 25:18.550]  This is kind of an experiment.
[25:18.550 --> 25:19.550]  I just want to see how these go.
[25:19.550 --> 25:21.550]  My first step...
[25:21.550 --> 25:23.550]  I said you needed a paper towel, right?
[25:23.550 --> 25:25.550]  I'm going to fold the paper towel into a small square.
[25:26.550 --> 25:29.550]  I'm going to fold it one, two, three, four times.
[25:29.550 --> 25:33.550]  I've got a little couple inch by couple inch here, fucking square ounce.
[25:33.550 --> 25:34.550]  It's nice and compact.
[25:34.550 --> 25:36.550]  It's nice and thick, so it's going to hold a bunch of water.
[25:36.550 --> 25:38.550]  I'm going to label it.
[25:38.550 --> 25:40.550]  I'm just going to label it blue healer.
[25:40.550 --> 25:42.550]  Just jump the gun here.
[25:45.550 --> 25:46.550]  Blue healer.
[25:48.550 --> 25:49.550]  All right.
[25:49.550 --> 25:51.550]  Now I'm going to throw that on a plate.
[25:51.550 --> 25:53.550]  I've got to set the seeds inside here so I don't lose them.
[25:53.550 --> 25:54.550]  The seeds are tiny.
[25:54.550 --> 25:55.550]  That's when you open your seed packaging.
[25:55.550 --> 25:58.550]  Whatever kind of packaging your seeds came in, don't lose them right off the bat.
[25:58.550 --> 25:59.550]  Those things are fucking expensive.
[25:59.550 --> 26:00.550]  Don't lose them.
[26:00.550 --> 26:01.550]  That'll piss you off.
[26:01.550 --> 26:05.550]  It's just like when you open your first package of Shatter and you lose that first dab.
[26:05.550 --> 26:06.550]  All right.
[26:06.550 --> 26:07.550]  We've got the paper towel.
[26:07.550 --> 26:09.550]  Let's fold it up into a little square here.
[26:09.550 --> 26:10.550]  I'm trying to get my water open.
[26:10.550 --> 26:11.550]  All right.
[26:14.550 --> 26:15.550]  I've folded it up.
[26:15.550 --> 26:16.550]  It's labeled.
[26:16.550 --> 26:18.550]  I'm going to go ahead and soak it.
[26:18.550 --> 26:20.550]  Put the paper towel on the plate and just soak the shit out of it.
[26:20.550 --> 26:21.550]  You want it soaked.
[26:24.550 --> 26:27.550]  I might even flip it over and do the other side a little bit.
[26:27.550 --> 26:30.550]  Make sure that it's saturated is the word I'm looking for.
[26:32.550 --> 26:35.550]  I've actually got some seeds on the plate that I did earlier.
[26:35.550 --> 26:36.550]  Some paper towels folded up.
[26:36.550 --> 26:39.550]  They're labeled that I did a little bit ago because I'm starting some new stuff.
[26:40.550 --> 26:44.550]  I'm going to kind of recreate something that I did a long time ago and got known for.
[26:44.550 --> 26:49.550]  I quit making it because it was not exciting to me anymore, but it's time to bring it back.
[26:49.550 --> 26:52.550]  Anyway, now this plate has too much water on it.
[26:52.550 --> 26:54.550]  I can tell that there's standing water on this plate.
[26:54.550 --> 26:55.550]  I can see it's in here.
[26:55.550 --> 26:57.550]  I don't want that there, so I'm actually going to tip it off.
[26:58.550 --> 27:00.550]  Hang on for one second while I run to the sink.
[27:00.550 --> 27:01.550]  Hold on. Here I go.
[27:02.550 --> 27:03.550]  I'm back. Wasn't that fast?
[27:03.550 --> 27:04.550]  I love editing. Cool.
[27:05.550 --> 27:09.550]  After the paper towel is nice and soggy and excess water is gone, unfold it two times.
[27:09.550 --> 27:10.550]  I know that sounds weird.
[27:10.550 --> 27:13.550]  We just folded it upright, but I want to get these seeds down in there in the middle.
[27:13.550 --> 27:14.550]  I just unfolded it.
[27:14.550 --> 27:15.550]  I'm going to drop the seeds in.
[27:17.550 --> 27:18.550]  We got one.
[27:18.550 --> 27:19.550]  We got two.
[27:20.550 --> 27:21.550]  We got three blue healer seeds.
[27:21.550 --> 27:25.550]  This is exciting for me because I get to see what happens with some shit that I just created.
[27:26.550 --> 27:27.550]  Fold it back up.
[27:29.550 --> 27:30.550]  Just fold it back up.
[27:30.550 --> 27:31.550]  It's all soaked.
[27:31.550 --> 27:32.550]  You just put them in the middle there.
[27:33.550 --> 27:34.550]  You want the paper towel to stay wet.
[27:34.550 --> 27:37.550]  Make sure it's damp and cold to your hand at all times.
[27:37.550 --> 27:42.550]  If that paper towel dries out, your seeds will perish and you'll be shopping for more seeds soon.
[27:43.550 --> 27:45.550]  Keep them damp, but not soggy from here on out.
[27:46.550 --> 27:49.550]  I set a timer to remind myself to check on them every four to six hours.
[27:50.550 --> 27:53.550]  I'll pour a splash of water on them whenever the paper towel seems to be getting dry.
[27:54.550 --> 27:57.550]  The time between watering is going to depend on your environment.
[27:58.550 --> 28:03.550]  I moved them from one room to the other today to have them sitting next to me during the podcast and recording.
[28:03.550 --> 28:08.550]  The ones I started earlier, they dried up because I have a swamp cooler right above where I'm sitting.
[28:08.550 --> 28:10.550]  It dried them out quite quickly.
[28:10.550 --> 28:13.550]  When they were in another room, they stayed wet for most of the day.
[28:14.550 --> 28:17.550]  That'll make a huge difference depending on where you are.
[28:17.550 --> 28:18.550]  Make sure you check them often.
[28:19.550 --> 28:21.550]  If you need to be gone for an extended amount of time,
[28:21.550 --> 28:28.550]  something that I recommend you can do is put the paper towel that you've got into a Ziploc baggie and seal it to keep the moisture in.
[28:29.550 --> 28:32.550]  I don't do this because I like to let my seedlings get a little more air.
[28:33.550 --> 28:37.550]  It helps if you're forgetful, if you're a pothead like a lot of us are.
[28:38.550 --> 28:42.550]  In 24 to 48 hours, hopefully, you've got some seedlings that have little sprouted tails.
[28:43.550 --> 28:44.550]  The tail is called the taproot.
[28:44.550 --> 28:45.550]  That's super sensitive.
[28:45.550 --> 28:47.550]  That's really important to your plant right now.
[28:47.550 --> 28:48.550]  Keep that thing intact.
[28:48.550 --> 28:51.550]  Be careful with the taproot while you're handling it, while you're planting your seedlings.
[28:52.550 --> 28:54.550]  That taproot is going to be the source of life.
[28:54.550 --> 28:57.550]  That sucker is going to dig all the way down to the bottom of your pot.
[28:58.550 --> 28:59.550]  It's going to start spiraling out.
[28:59.550 --> 29:02.550]  That's what's going to make your plant flourish, hopefully, if you do things right.
[29:03.550 --> 29:06.550]  You've got a little tiny seedling that's sitting in a paper towel after a couple days.
[29:06.550 --> 29:08.550]  Now, you've got to get it into some soil.
[29:08.550 --> 29:12.550]  Hopefully, you've got some cups or whatever kind of pots you're going to put it in.
[29:12.550 --> 29:13.550]  It's ready.
[29:13.550 --> 29:14.550]  Get your soil.
[29:14.550 --> 29:17.550]  Pack it into the container that you're going to use, the cup or whatever.
[29:18.550 --> 29:19.550]  Get it lightly packed.
[29:19.550 --> 29:21.550]  You want it in there firm, but not hard.
[29:21.550 --> 29:24.550]  You want those roots to be able to grow, but you also want them to do a little bit of work.
[29:24.550 --> 29:26.550]  You don't want them to just be able to push through.
[29:26.550 --> 29:28.550]  You want to make your plant tough at this point.
[29:29.550 --> 29:32.550]  Also, if you're using cups, make sure you have plenty of drainage holes in there.
[29:32.550 --> 29:34.550]  Make sure that the pots you're using are ...
[29:35.550 --> 29:36.550]  Don't use clay pots.
[29:36.550 --> 29:40.550]  Use plastic pots or earth pots or air pots or regular pots.
[29:40.550 --> 29:42.550]  Or earth pots or air pots or root pots.
[29:42.550 --> 29:43.550]  Something cool like that.
[29:44.550 --> 29:45.550]  There are a couple reasons for that.
[29:46.550 --> 29:47.550]  You've got these seedlings.
[29:47.550 --> 29:51.550]  Now, you've got your cup full of dirt or your container full of dirt.
[29:51.550 --> 29:54.550]  I recommend to water the containers with pH balanced water.
[29:55.550 --> 29:56.550]  If you're going to ...
[29:56.550 --> 29:57.550]  Don't use nutrients at this time.
[29:57.550 --> 29:59.550]  Wait until a little bit later to use nutrients.
[30:00.550 --> 30:02.550]  Get your pot filled with soil and water it.
[30:03.550 --> 30:04.550]  You're going to see the pot kind of ...
[30:04.550 --> 30:07.550]  The dirt is going to kind of cave in because you've left air spots in there.
[30:07.550 --> 30:09.550]  That's just how dirt works when you water it the first time.
[30:09.550 --> 30:12.550]  You may have to go back and sprinkle a couple more handfuls of dirt in there.
[30:13.550 --> 30:14.550]  If it's a larger pot.
[30:14.550 --> 30:15.550]  If it's a cup, you just need a little bit more.
[30:15.550 --> 30:17.550]  Don't go put more handfuls in one cup.
[30:17.550 --> 30:18.550]  Whatever.
[30:18.550 --> 30:19.550]  You don't want an ice cream cone.
[30:20.550 --> 30:21.550]  Again, make sure the dirt's right.
[30:21.550 --> 30:27.550]  Before you put the seed in there, what I do is I just push my finger in up to about the first knuckle into the dirt.
[30:28.550 --> 30:31.550]  Or down, I guess, into the dirt to my first knuckle.
[30:32.550 --> 30:33.550]  Just make a little indention with my finger.
[30:33.550 --> 30:35.550]  Then I just set the seed right inside there.
[30:35.550 --> 30:36.550]  I don't even bury really.
[30:36.550 --> 30:38.550]  I just kind of back fill the dirt real gently.
[30:39.550 --> 30:40.550]  Just kind of push it on top of there.
[30:41.550 --> 30:42.550]  Just where it's covered up from the light.
[30:43.550 --> 30:45.550]  Give it a little bit of a challenge to push through to the top.
[30:46.550 --> 30:48.550]  It grows more quickly down than it does up.
[30:48.550 --> 30:50.550]  It'll push its way through really quickly.
[30:50.550 --> 30:52.550]  When it does, hopefully it's got a nice rooted bottom to it.
[30:53.550 --> 30:55.550]  You've got your little seedlings.
[30:55.550 --> 30:56.550]  They've sprouted.
[30:56.550 --> 30:57.550]  They're about 24 to 48.
[30:58.550 --> 30:59.550]  A little while longer.
[30:59.550 --> 31:00.550]  If they take a little longer, don't worry.
[31:00.550 --> 31:01.550]  Just let them go.
[31:01.550 --> 31:02.550]  Keep them wet.
[31:02.550 --> 31:03.550]  Let them keep going.
[31:03.550 --> 31:05.550]  I've seen seeds take up to four or five days to pop.
[31:06.550 --> 31:08.550]  Sometimes older seeds need more love or whatever.
[31:09.550 --> 31:10.550]  Give them time.
[31:10.550 --> 31:11.550]  You've got your seedlings.
[31:11.550 --> 31:12.550]  They've got a little sprout.
[31:12.550 --> 31:16.550]  You filled your container with dirt.
[31:17.550 --> 31:18.550]  You pressed it down a little bit.
[31:18.550 --> 31:19.550]  You watered it.
[31:19.550 --> 31:20.550]  You made an indention with your finger.
[31:20.550 --> 31:21.550]  You dropped your seed in there.
[31:21.550 --> 31:22.550]  You covered it up.
[31:23.550 --> 31:24.550]  Set that sucker under your grow light.
[31:26.550 --> 31:27.550]  A T5 light works perfect right now.
[31:28.550 --> 31:29.550]  Fluorescent and T5.
[31:29.550 --> 31:32.550]  You don't need a big 400 watt or 1000 watt light right now.
[31:32.550 --> 31:34.550]  A little T5 or some of you guys like the LEDs.
[31:36.550 --> 31:37.550]  That'll work fine for you right now.
[31:38.550 --> 31:39.550]  That'll work fine until you get close to the bloom phase.
[31:40.550 --> 31:41.550]  We'll stop right now.
[31:42.550 --> 31:43.550]  That was the end of the first grow lesson that I want to do.
[31:44.550 --> 31:45.550]  Thanks for joining me for that.
[31:45.550 --> 31:46.550]  That was really cool.
[31:46.550 --> 31:47.550]  I'm going to take a quick break again.
[31:47.550 --> 31:48.550]  A lot of breaks in this show.
[31:49.550 --> 31:50.550]  It's actually just easy segues to tell you the truth.
[31:51.550 --> 31:52.550]  Lots of spots to take dabs and drinks.
[31:53.550 --> 31:54.550]  I'm going to do a dab, do a drink.
[31:55.550 --> 31:56.550]  I'll be right back.
[31:57.550 --> 31:58.550]  We're going to talk about what's coming up in the next show.
[31:59.550 --> 32:00.550]  We're going to give thanks to somebody super special.
[32:00.550 --> 32:01.550]  Hang on guys, I'll be right back.
[32:06.550 --> 32:07.550]  There was a lot of stuff to learn in that episode.
[32:08.550 --> 32:09.550]  Make sure you join me next week.
[32:10.550 --> 32:11.550]  I'll have Jesse back.
[32:12.550 --> 32:13.550]  He's going to talk a little bit more about outdoor growing.
[32:14.550 --> 32:16.550]  I'm going to teach you how to cut a clone and take care of your baby clones.
[32:17.550 --> 32:18.550]  Once those clones and the seedlings catch up,
[32:19.550 --> 32:20.550]  they get about the same size,
[32:21.550 --> 32:22.550]  we will start talking a little bit more about veg,
[32:23.550 --> 32:25.550]  the vegetative phase, and healthy veg feeding.
[32:26.550 --> 32:28.550]  We'll talk about a little bit about how to grow vegetables.
[32:28.550 --> 32:29.550]  We'll talk about veg feeding.
[32:30.550 --> 32:31.550]  We'll talk about a little bit of training.
[32:32.550 --> 32:33.550]  How to train your plants to grow the way you want them.
[32:34.550 --> 32:37.550]  We'll talk about all the basics of veg growth.
[32:38.550 --> 32:39.550]  Don't forget about Nature's Green Remedies.

[32:52.550 --> 32:54.550]  Now it's time when we give thanks to somebody
[32:55.550 --> 32:57.550]  who has been beneficial or crucial to the Canada Green Program.
[32:58.550 --> 33:02.550]  The person that I have chosen to give thanks to this week is,
[33:03.550 --> 33:05.550]  of course, and I know that you guys have been waiting for this one,
[33:06.550 --> 33:07.550]  it is Dr. Lester Grinspoon.
[33:08.550 --> 33:11.550]  Some of you guys might not know who Lester Grinspoon is.
[33:12.550 --> 33:16.550]  Dr. Grinspoon was born June 24, 1928 in Newton, Massachusetts.
[33:17.550 --> 33:20.550]  He graduated from Tufts University and Harvard Medical School.
[33:21.550 --> 33:25.550]  As a doctor, Grinspoon was the first American physician
[33:25.550 --> 33:29.550]  to prescribe lithium carbonate for bipolar disorder.
[33:30.550 --> 33:31.550]  I know that sounds crazy, right?
[33:32.550 --> 33:33.550]  But anyway, here's the good part.
[33:34.550 --> 33:36.550]  Dr. Grinspoon became interested in marijuana in the 1960s
[33:37.550 --> 33:39.550]  when its use in the United States increased dramatically.
[33:40.550 --> 33:43.550]  He had no doubt that it was a very harmful drug
[33:44.550 --> 33:47.550]  that was unfortunately being used by more foolish young people
[33:48.550 --> 33:50.550]  who would not listen to or could not believe or understand
[33:51.550 --> 33:52.550]  the warnings about its dangers.
[33:52.550 --> 33:55.550]  When Grinspoon began studying marijuana in 1967,
[33:56.550 --> 34:00.550]  his intention was to define scientifically the nature and degree of those dangers.
[34:01.550 --> 34:03.550]  But as he reviewed the existing literature on the subject,
[34:04.550 --> 34:06.550]  Grinspoon reached the conclusion he and the general public
[34:07.550 --> 34:08.550]  had been misinformed and misled.
[34:09.550 --> 34:11.550]  So originally when Grinspoon started out studying cannabis,
[34:12.550 --> 34:14.550]  he wanted to prove that it was making people crazy
[34:15.550 --> 34:16.550]  and it was all a problem.
[34:17.550 --> 34:18.550]  But the more research Dr. Grinspoon did,
[34:19.550 --> 34:21.550]  the more he realized that we were being lied to
[34:22.550 --> 34:23.550]  and that we were being misled.
[34:27.550 --> 34:28.550]  Dr. Grinspoon once said,
[34:29.550 --> 34:30.550]  there was little empirical evidence to support my beliefs
[34:31.550 --> 34:32.550]  about the dangers of marijuana,
[34:33.550 --> 34:35.550]  and he was convinced cannabis was much less harmful than he had believed.
[34:36.550 --> 34:39.550]  The title, Marijuana Reconsidered, reflected change in that view.
[34:42.550 --> 34:44.550]  Grinspoon is widely known as the author or co-author
[34:45.550 --> 34:47.550]  of several cannabis psychedelic-related books,
[34:48.550 --> 34:49.550]  including Marijuana Reconsidered,
[34:50.550 --> 34:51.550]  Psychedelic Drugs Reconsidered,
[34:52.550 --> 34:54.550]  Forbidden Medicine, and Psychedelic Reflections.
[34:55.550 --> 34:56.550]  The first two were published during the 1970s
[34:57.550 --> 34:58.550]  when it appeared cannabis was well on its way
[34:59.550 --> 35:01.550]  to nationwide decriminalization in the United States.
[35:02.550 --> 35:04.550]  Marijuana, the Forbidden Medicine was published in 1993.
[35:05.550 --> 35:06.550]  It describes a variety of ailments
[35:07.550 --> 35:08.550]  for which cannabis ingestion may be indicated.
[35:09.550 --> 35:11.550]  Dr. Grinspoon appeared in an episode of the Showtime series
[35:12.550 --> 35:13.550]  Penn & Teller's Bullshit,
[35:14.550 --> 35:15.550]  the episode which addressed America's war on drugs
[35:16.550 --> 35:17.550]  aired in the show's second season.
[35:18.550 --> 35:21.550]  Grinspoon discussed the way marijuana helped his young son
[35:22.550 --> 35:24.550]  from his dying from leukemia in the 1970s,
[35:25.550 --> 35:27.550]  completely eliminating horrible nausea and vomiting
[35:28.550 --> 35:30.550]  he experienced after each of his chemotherapy treatments,
[35:31.550 --> 35:33.550]  and thereby making the final year and a half of the boy's life
[35:34.550 --> 35:36.550]  far more comfortable for his son and for Grinspoon and his wife
[35:37.550 --> 35:39.550]  by not having to endure the pain of witnessing their son suffer.
[35:40.550 --> 35:45.550]  Grinspoon was also in a documentary called The Union,
[35:46.550 --> 35:47.550]  The Business of Getting High.
[35:48.550 --> 35:50.550]  He's the guy that was talking about the pharmaceutical characteristics
[35:50.550 --> 35:53.550]  of marijuana as well as his writing experience
[35:54.550 --> 35:55.550]  and also getting high with Carl Sagan.
[35:56.550 --> 35:58.550]  Dr. Grinspoon even has a stream named after him.
[35:59.550 --> 36:00.550]  He's so influential.
[36:01.550 --> 36:02.550]  He has influenced a lot of people.
[36:03.550 --> 36:04.550]  The people that taught us how to grow
[36:05.550 --> 36:06.550]  learned a lot from Dr. Lester Grinspoon.
[36:07.550 --> 36:08.550]  So we owe a lot to that guy.
[36:09.550 --> 36:10.550]  Big thanks to Dr. Lester Grinspoon.
[36:11.550 --> 36:12.550]  You're an activist, you're an author,
[36:13.550 --> 36:14.550]  you're a cannabis supporter.
[36:15.550 --> 36:17.550]  In your day, you were brainwashed to think
[36:17.550 --> 36:21.550]  that this plant was dangerous, and you did your own research.
[36:22.550 --> 36:24.550]  And you had enough balls to come out and say,
[36:25.550 --> 36:26.550]  you know what, I was wrong, and this plant is actually beneficial.
[36:27.550 --> 36:28.550]  So for that, I have to say thank you.
[36:29.550 --> 36:30.550]  So thank you, Dr. Grinspoon.
[36:31.550 --> 36:32.550]  We really appreciate it.
[36:33.550 --> 36:34.550]  So that just about wraps up this episode of the iGrow Culture podcast.
[36:35.550 --> 36:36.550]  I appreciate you guys hanging in while it's just me.
[36:37.550 --> 36:38.550]  Kevin was really sick this week.
[36:39.550 --> 36:40.550]  I'm going to have Jesse back.
[36:41.550 --> 36:42.550]  We'll have a couple other people joining us in the future.
[36:43.550 --> 36:44.550]  We'll keep it more entertaining than just me ranting on.
[36:45.550 --> 36:46.550]  Once again, I want to encourage you to check out

[37:01.550 --> 37:02.550]  Thanks for joining us, you guys.
[37:03.550 --> 37:04.550]  Take a fat dab, and give your mom a hug for me.

[39:07.630 --> 39:08.630]  by TreeThugger.com,
[39:09.630 --> 39:10.630]  Live Music Lifestyle Magazine.
[39:11.630 --> 39:12.630]  And by our patrons,
[39:13.630 --> 39:14.630]  www.treethugger.com.
[39:15.630 --> 39:16.630]  I want to take a second
[39:17.630 --> 39:18.630]  to say hi to Nick from Pueblo West.
[39:19.630 --> 39:20.630]  Thanks for the comment on Stitcher.
[39:21.630 --> 39:22.630]  Pretty soon, we should have a Dab Lounge
[39:23.630 --> 39:24.630]  available in this area.
[39:25.630 --> 39:26.630]  And I invite you to come down
[39:27.630 --> 39:28.630]  and take some dabs with me when we do.
[39:29.630 --> 39:30.630]  Can't wait to meet you.
[39:31.630 --> 39:32.630]  So if you guys want to leave a comment on iTunes,
[39:33.630 --> 39:34.630]  I'll try to read it on the show.
[39:35.630 --> 39:36.630]  I also find the comments on Stitcher
[39:37.630 --> 39:38.630]  and read those on the show.
[39:39.630 --> 39:40.630]  The comments on Stitcher are harder to find.
[39:41.630 --> 39:42.630]  So if you want to leave a comment on,
[39:43.630 --> 39:44.630]  that's where Stitcher will leave it.
[39:45.630 --> 39:46.630]  So I have to go back and look at
[39:47.630 --> 39:48.630]  each individual episode to find the comments.
[39:49.630 --> 39:50.630]  We'll figure out a way to beat that system.
[39:51.630 --> 39:52.630]  We'll get smart pretty soon.
[39:53.630 --> 39:54.630]  How about we just leave all the comments
[39:55.630 --> 39:56.630]  on episode 13?
[39:57.630 --> 39:58.630]  Just go comment on 13.
[39:59.630 --> 40:00.630]  It's already up.
[40:01.630 --> 40:02.630]  So if you're going to leave comments,
[40:03.630 --> 40:04.630]  do them on episode 13
[40:05.630 --> 40:06.630]  and I'll find them all there.
[40:07.630 --> 40:08.630]  Makes it easier for me.
[40:09.630 --> 40:10.630]  So leave a comment there.
[40:11.630 --> 40:12.630]  I'm from the agro culture
[40:13.630 --> 40:14.630]  and I'll respond to you there.
[40:15.630 --> 40:16.630]  If you want to say something anonymously,
[40:17.630 --> 40:18.630]  send me a personal message
[40:19.630 --> 40:20.630]  and I will keep your name private.
[40:21.630 --> 40:22.630]  I won't put you on blast on the show.
[40:23.630 --> 40:24.630]  In this episode, we have Jesse and Spencer.
[40:25.630 --> 40:26.630]  They came over and talked about
[40:27.630 --> 40:28.630]  a little bit of outdoor growing
[40:29.630 --> 40:30.630]  and we took a few dabs.
[40:31.630 --> 40:32.630]  We took a lot of dabs
[40:33.630 --> 40:34.630]  and talked about a few things.
[40:35.630 --> 40:36.630]  So I'm going to take a couple of dabs
[40:37.630 --> 40:38.630]  and do some seamless editing
[40:39.630 --> 40:40.630]  and we'll be right back
[40:41.630 --> 40:42.630]  with more outdoor growing.
[40:43.630 --> 40:44.630]  All right guys,
[40:45.630 --> 40:46.630]  so we are here hanging out with Jesse.
[40:47.630 --> 40:48.630]  He's back again to talk about
[40:49.630 --> 40:50.630]  some more outdoor growing
[40:51.630 --> 40:52.630]  to catch up from where we were last time.
[40:53.630 --> 40:54.630]  And we also got our buddy Spence
[40:55.630 --> 40:56.630]  from the Garden of Weeden.
[40:57.630 --> 40:58.630]  What's up, bro?
[40:59.630 --> 41:00.630]  Chilling, brother.
[41:01.630 --> 41:02.630]  Chilling, chilling.
[41:03.630 --> 41:04.630]  It's good to have you here, bro.
[41:05.630 --> 41:06.630]  Thanks for coming.
[41:07.630 --> 41:08.630]  No problem.
[41:09.630 --> 41:10.630]  Thanks.
[41:11.630 --> 41:12.630]  So Jesse's here.
[41:13.630 --> 41:14.630]  We'll get right down to it.
[41:15.630 --> 41:16.630]  Last time Jesse was here,
[41:17.630 --> 41:18.630]  we talked about pretty much
[41:19.630 --> 41:20.630]  prepping for outdoor season.
[41:21.630 --> 41:22.630]  We talked about security.
[41:23.630 --> 41:24.630]  We talked about soil prep.
[41:25.630 --> 41:26.630]  We talked about caging and pruning.
[41:27.630 --> 41:28.630]  We touched on strain selections.
[41:29.630 --> 41:30.630]  We got our plants in the ground.
[41:31.630 --> 41:32.630]  We had them topped several times.
[41:33.630 --> 41:34.630]  So by now, we should have
[41:35.630 --> 41:36.630]  some happy little bushes
[41:37.630 --> 41:38.630]  that are adjusted to being outside, right?
[41:39.630 --> 41:40.630]  Yeah.
[41:41.630 --> 41:42.630]  Hopefully nobody did that already.
[41:43.630 --> 41:44.630]  They figured it out
[41:45.630 --> 41:46.630]  if they were listening to us
[41:47.630 --> 41:48.630]  as they did this.
[41:49.630 --> 41:50.630]  Yeah.
[41:51.630 --> 41:52.630]  What you should have done,
[41:53.630 --> 41:54.630]  what you should have done,
[41:55.630 --> 41:56.630]  you should have put your plant out
[41:57.630 --> 41:58.630]  for a couple hours one day
[41:59.630 --> 42:00.630]  and brought it inside
[42:01.630 --> 42:02.630]  and then maybe a few more hours
[42:03.630 --> 42:04.630]  the next day and brought it inside.
[42:05.630 --> 42:06.630]  You didn't want to throw that poor bastard
[42:07.630 --> 42:08.630]  out in the cold and just fucking tell it to live
[42:09.630 --> 42:10.630]  and wish it good luck.
[42:11.630 --> 42:12.630]  You want it to be strong and happy and living.
[42:13.630 --> 42:14.630]  Pretty hardy plant.
[42:15.630 --> 42:16.630]  Yeah.
[42:17.630 --> 42:18.630]  You know you got a winner
[42:19.630 --> 42:20.630]  if it lives through the hill.
[42:21.630 --> 42:22.630]  Hell yeah.
[42:23.630 --> 42:24.630]  If it lived through the hill
[42:25.630 --> 42:26.630]  that we got tonight in Pueblo,
[42:27.630 --> 42:28.630]  you've got a good plant.
[42:29.630 --> 42:30.630]  Be prepared for that.
[42:31.630 --> 42:32.630]  What's a good way to prevent that plant
[42:33.630 --> 42:34.630]  from getting beat to shit by some hail?
[42:35.630 --> 42:36.630]  Overhead covering.
[42:37.630 --> 42:38.630]  So you mean like maybe
[42:39.630 --> 42:40.630]  a trash can or something?
[42:41.630 --> 42:42.630]  Well,
[42:43.630 --> 42:44.630]  some kind of framing.
[42:45.630 --> 42:46.630]  Maybe some PVC hoops.
[42:47.630 --> 42:48.630]  You know,
[42:49.630 --> 42:50.630]  fence to fence or something like that.
[42:51.630 --> 42:52.630]  Some tin stakes.
[42:53.630 --> 42:54.630]  Get creative.
[42:55.630 --> 42:56.630]  Most owners are.
[42:57.630 --> 42:58.630]  We are a creative bunch.
[42:59.630 --> 43:00.630]  Cover those babies.
[43:01.630 --> 43:02.630]  Yeah, that's stuff that you guys
[43:03.630 --> 43:04.630]  are going to have to think about.
[43:05.630 --> 43:06.630]  So if you've got it covered,
[43:07.630 --> 43:08.630]  do you want to put a heater in there
[43:09.630 --> 43:10.630]  later on in the season?
[43:11.630 --> 43:12.630]  Yeah, so I can wrap my area
[43:13.630 --> 43:14.630]  in plastic
[43:15.630 --> 43:16.630]  and keep my plants going.
[43:17.630 --> 43:18.630]  I've had them in November.
[43:19.630 --> 43:20.630]  That's crazy here in Colorado.
[43:21.630 --> 43:22.630]  Usually Halloween is your cutoff time
[43:23.630 --> 43:24.630]  for what most people say.
[43:25.630 --> 43:26.630]  You get humidity buildup,
[43:27.630 --> 43:28.630]  so you've got to have a vent
[43:29.630 --> 43:30.630]  and a decent heater, some fans.
[43:31.630 --> 43:32.630]  Some fans to keep that humidity
[43:33.630 --> 43:34.630]  from not being stagnant in one spot.
[43:35.630 --> 43:36.630]  Oh yeah, it is.
[43:37.630 --> 43:38.630]  It'll create all kinds of problems
[43:39.630 --> 43:40.630]  you don't normally have here.
[43:41.630 --> 43:42.630]  If you had that tent thing going on,
[43:43.630 --> 43:44.630]  the cover, would we run any risk
[43:45.630 --> 43:46.630]  of humidity problems, of mold
[43:47.630 --> 43:48.630]  or anything like that outdoors?
[43:49.630 --> 43:50.630]  Right after rains,
[43:51.630 --> 43:52.630]  but other than that,
[43:53.630 --> 43:54.630]  Southern Colorado at least
[43:55.630 --> 43:57.630]  isn't a high humidity area.
[43:58.630 --> 43:59.630]  Colorado in general
[44:00.630 --> 44:01.630]  isn't high humidity.
[44:02.630 --> 44:03.630]  When it rains,
[44:04.630 --> 44:05.630]  should I go outside and shake the leaves?
[44:06.630 --> 44:07.630]  Yeah.
[44:07.630 --> 44:08.630]  Shake the sticks to where it kind of
[44:09.630 --> 44:10.630]  wiggles all the rain off my leaves?
[44:11.630 --> 44:12.630]  Yeah, near your plant.
[44:13.630 --> 44:14.630]  Okay, kind of brush that off a little.
[44:15.630 --> 44:16.630]  Can you talk into the mic just a little more?
[44:17.630 --> 44:18.630]  I know you're shy, but just a little more.
[44:19.630 --> 44:20.630]  I don't have to turn you up so high.
[44:21.630 --> 44:22.630]  You sound a little better.
[44:23.630 --> 44:24.630]  Yeah.
[44:25.630 --> 44:26.630]  Are you going to turn yourself down
[44:27.630 --> 44:28.630]  on the headphones so you don't hear yourself?
[44:29.630 --> 44:30.630]  You'll get used to it.
[44:31.630 --> 44:32.630]  By the third or fourth time,
[44:33.630 --> 44:34.630]  you'll be like,
[44:35.630 --> 44:36.630]  you look way better on the computer.
[44:37.630 --> 44:38.630]  That's all I needed.
[44:39.630 --> 44:40.630]  We've got our plants going.
[44:41.630 --> 44:42.630]  Are you going to have
[44:43.630 --> 44:44.630]  a vegetative phase in the flower?
[44:45.630 --> 44:46.630]  I know that indoors,
[44:47.630 --> 44:48.630]  I see signs in 10 days,
[44:49.630 --> 44:50.630]  maybe 14 days on a longer switching strain.
[44:51.630 --> 44:52.630]  Yeah, you're going to have
[44:53.630 --> 44:54.630]  what I refer to as a stretch period.
[44:55.630 --> 44:56.630]  It's just a little different period
[44:57.630 --> 44:58.630]  that you don't have indoors.
[44:59.630 --> 45:00.630]  They're not going to really be
[45:01.630 --> 45:02.630]  developing flowers.
[45:03.630 --> 45:04.630]  They'll bolt all of a sudden.
[45:05.630 --> 45:06.630]  You're like,
[45:07.630 --> 45:08.630]  wow, what's going on?
[45:09.630 --> 45:10.630]  It's a little bit of a stretch.
[45:11.630 --> 45:12.630]  Quite different than indoors.
[45:13.630 --> 45:14.630]  Inside,
[45:15.630 --> 45:16.630]  your plants usually double in size.
[45:17.630 --> 45:18.630]  Outside, are they going to triple?
[45:19.630 --> 45:20.630]  Yeah, maybe even more.
[45:21.630 --> 45:22.630]  Maybe even more.
[45:23.630 --> 45:24.630]  I say you get those,
[45:25.630 --> 45:26.630]  if you didn't top the plant,
[45:27.630 --> 45:28.630]  the thing's going to get gigantic.
[45:29.630 --> 45:30.630]  If it's like a seed plant.
[45:31.630 --> 45:32.630]  That huge top.
[45:33.630 --> 45:34.630]  If I've got my plants outside
[45:35.630 --> 45:36.630]  and my fence is six or eight feet tall,
[45:37.630 --> 45:38.630]  I better just keep them short
[45:39.630 --> 45:40.630]  before flower time comes.
[45:41.630 --> 45:42.630]  We're talking about trellising and shit.
[45:43.630 --> 45:44.630]  We've got some outside plants.
[45:45.630 --> 45:46.630]  They're happy.
[45:47.630 --> 45:48.630]  They're having a good time.
[45:49.630 --> 45:50.630]  How are we going to keep them
[45:51.630 --> 45:52.630]  from getting too tall?
[45:53.630 --> 45:54.630]  We talked about it a little bit last time.
[45:55.630 --> 45:56.630]  Those buds are going to get big and floppy pretty soon.
[45:57.630 --> 45:58.630]  They're going to start taking off.
[45:59.630 --> 46:00.630]  Not the buds, but the branches
[46:01.630 --> 46:02.630]  are going to get big and floppy.
[46:03.630 --> 46:04.630]  Do we want to use sticks
[46:05.630 --> 46:06.630]  just like I do inside?
[46:07.630 --> 46:08.630]  Sticks, tomato cages.
[46:09.630 --> 46:10.630]  I think we touched on
[46:11.630 --> 46:12.630]  the indoor netting.
[46:13.630 --> 46:14.630]  Like a screen of green kind of idea?
[46:15.630 --> 46:16.630]  Yeah.
[46:17.630 --> 46:18.630]  Or even just throw it over the plant.
[46:19.630 --> 46:20.630]  Stick it to the ground
[46:21.630 --> 46:22.630]  and pull the branches down
[46:23.630 --> 46:24.630]  into the different little squares.
[46:25.630 --> 46:26.630]  That's pretty smart.
[46:27.630 --> 46:28.630]  I would not have thought of that.
[46:29.630 --> 46:30.630]  One bud top per square.
[46:31.630 --> 46:32.630]  You're going to have
[46:33.630 --> 46:34.630]  a beautiful little Christmas tree.
[46:35.630 --> 46:36.630]  People don't think about
[46:37.630 --> 46:38.630]  trying to maximize their space.
[46:39.630 --> 46:40.630]  They forget about that.
[46:41.630 --> 46:42.630]  One bud per space.
[46:43.630 --> 46:44.630]  They're looking happy.
[46:45.630 --> 46:46.630]  We've figured out how to keep them safe.
[46:47.630 --> 46:48.630]  What are we going to feed
[46:49.630 --> 46:50.630]  while we're outside?
[46:51.630 --> 46:52.630]  If it were you,
[46:53.630 --> 46:54.630]  a lot of people are going to mix up
[46:55.630 --> 46:56.630]  some bottled crap and pour that right outdoors,
[46:57.630 --> 46:58.630]  which sucks.
[46:59.630 --> 47:00.630]  I would recommend don't do that to our earth.
[47:01.630 --> 47:02.630]  Don't do that to your plants.
[47:03.630 --> 47:04.630]  If you can avoid it,
[47:05.630 --> 47:06.630]  you're going outside.
[47:07.630 --> 47:08.630]  Let's go natural.
[47:09.630 --> 47:10.630]  Let's stick with Jesse's ideas
[47:11.630 --> 47:12.630]  to supplement
[47:13.630 --> 47:14.630]  and help keep the soil healthy.
[47:15.630 --> 47:16.630]  Add teas.
[47:17.630 --> 47:19.630]  Molasses-based
[47:20.630 --> 47:23.630]  stoner moment.
[47:24.630 --> 47:25.630]  It's like a molasses-based compost tea
[47:26.630 --> 47:27.630]  with warm castings.
[47:28.630 --> 47:29.630]  That's what I'm trying to think of.
[47:30.630 --> 47:31.630]  Different guanos.
[47:32.630 --> 47:33.630]  I kind of tune my guanos
[47:34.630 --> 47:35.630]  to what growth stage the plants are in.
[47:36.630 --> 47:37.630]  Peruvian and Mexican guanos.
[47:38.630 --> 47:39.630]  Seabird guano.
[47:39.630 --> 47:40.630]  That's what I would probably go for.
[47:41.630 --> 47:42.630]  I've noticed a lot of the seabird stuff
[47:43.630 --> 47:44.630]  is really beneficial.
[47:45.630 --> 47:46.630]  Any kind of sea products are really beneficial.
[47:47.630 --> 47:48.630]  It brings out the taste.
[47:49.630 --> 47:50.630]  I really feel like that.
[47:51.630 --> 47:53.630]  The Jamaican is always high in P and K.
[47:54.630 --> 47:55.630]  Good for leafy.
[47:56.630 --> 47:57.630]  Always makes me laugh.
[47:58.630 --> 48:00.630]  Jamaican is there for the good part.
[48:01.630 --> 48:02.630]  That's good.
[48:03.630 --> 48:04.630]  That's perfect.
[48:05.630 --> 48:06.630]  How do you make your compost tea?
[48:07.630 --> 48:08.630]  You've got some molasses,
[48:09.630 --> 48:10.630]  you've got the warm castings,
[48:11.630 --> 48:12.630]  you've got your guano.
[48:13.630 --> 48:14.630]  Whatever else we're going to add in there just for fun.
[48:15.630 --> 48:16.630]  That's when you guys have to get creative on your own.
[48:17.630 --> 48:18.630]  How do you do that?
[48:19.630 --> 48:20.630]  Like a five-gallon bucket worth?
[48:21.630 --> 48:22.630]  Five-gallon bucket worth.
[48:23.630 --> 48:24.630]  You need an air stone,
[48:25.630 --> 48:26.630]  a little aquarium air pump,
[48:27.630 --> 48:28.630]  four gallons of dechlorinated water
[48:29.630 --> 48:30.630]  or reverse osmosis water.
[48:31.630 --> 48:32.630]  That's something to talk about in a later show.
[48:33.630 --> 48:34.630]  I'm going to write that down.
[48:35.630 --> 48:36.630]  RO water.
[48:37.630 --> 48:38.630]  Something I'll cover for the guys later.
[48:39.630 --> 48:40.630]  Spence, you look like you're going to fall asleep, bro.
[48:41.630 --> 48:42.630]  You all right?
[48:43.630 --> 48:44.630]  I'm chilling, though.
[48:45.630 --> 48:46.630]  You learning?
[48:47.630 --> 48:48.630]  Cool.
[48:49.630 --> 48:50.630]  You can mix them up in a pantyhose.
[48:51.630 --> 48:52.630]  All your different ingredients,
[48:53.630 --> 48:54.630]  like your dry ingredients,
[48:55.630 --> 48:56.630]  you can just put them right in the bucket.
[48:57.630 --> 48:58.630]  I've seen both ways.
[48:59.630 --> 49:00.630]  It works either way.
[49:01.630 --> 49:02.630]  Make like a tea bag out of the pantyhose pretty much?
[49:03.630 --> 49:04.630]  For sure.
[49:05.630 --> 49:06.630]  Or just drop it right in there and let it stir around?
[49:07.630 --> 49:08.630]  I personally just drop it right in there.
[49:09.630 --> 49:10.630]  I'm just going to let it stir.
[49:11.630 --> 49:12.630]  It stirs around pretty good.
[49:13.630 --> 49:14.630]  Get it nice and frothy?
[49:15.630 --> 49:16.630]  Yes.
[49:17.630 --> 49:18.630]  Are you going to dilute that five-gallon bucket
[49:19.630 --> 49:20.630]  into a larger portion or just use that?
[49:21.630 --> 49:22.630]  That kind of depends on your recipe.
[49:23.630 --> 49:24.630]  I use it diluted.
[49:25.630 --> 49:28.630]  I use like 25, 30 gallons and dilute that.
[49:29.630 --> 49:32.630]  It's a different size operation.
[49:33.630 --> 49:34.630]  I know where you guys work.
[49:35.630 --> 49:36.630]  Shout out to the boss over there.
[49:37.630 --> 49:38.630]  What up, Hanky?
[49:39.630 --> 49:40.630]  How are you?
[49:41.630 --> 49:42.630]  I'm good.
[49:43.630 --> 49:44.630]  How often do you feed the teas?
[49:45.630 --> 49:46.630]  I do them once a week on my outdoor stuff.
[49:47.630 --> 49:48.630]  Then like I said,
[49:49.630 --> 49:50.630]  I tune the ingredients to the growth period.
[49:51.630 --> 49:52.630]  The things that always remain constant
[49:53.630 --> 49:55.630]  is a product called Great White,
[49:56.630 --> 49:58.630]  worm castings, molasses.
[49:59.630 --> 50:00.630]  I make my own compost too.
[50:01.630 --> 50:02.630]  I always throw that in there too.
[50:03.630 --> 50:04.630]  Cool.
[50:05.630 --> 50:06.630]  Are you using food and stuff for your compost?
[50:07.630 --> 50:08.630]  Yes, vegetable scraps.
[50:09.630 --> 50:10.630]  Awesome.
[50:11.630 --> 50:12.630]  Way to recycle.
[50:13.630 --> 50:14.630]  Everybody should start a compost pile.
[50:15.630 --> 50:16.630]  You can do it in very little space.
[50:17.630 --> 50:18.630]  It's very beneficial for your plants.
[50:19.630 --> 50:20.630]  It's beneficial for the earth.
[50:21.630 --> 50:22.630]  You'll learn a lot.
[50:23.630 --> 50:24.630]  You'll start taking better care of your body
[50:25.630 --> 50:26.630]  once you start seeing the whole cycle of the plant and everything.
[50:27.630 --> 50:28.630]  I think so.
[50:29.630 --> 50:30.630]  I did.
[50:31.630 --> 50:32.630]  Do you use your chickens?
[50:33.630 --> 50:34.630]  Yes, I have chickens too.
[50:35.630 --> 50:36.630]  I use their scrapings to get fed a non-GMO food
[50:36.630 --> 50:37.630]  and some stuff grown on my family farm.
[50:38.630 --> 50:39.630]  Vegetable scraps sometimes as well.
[50:40.630 --> 50:41.630]  When I clean their little yard,
[50:42.630 --> 50:43.630]  all that stuff goes into the pile.
[50:44.630 --> 50:45.630]  I tie their eggshells to their feathers.
[50:46.630 --> 50:47.630]  The feathers.
[50:48.630 --> 50:49.630]  The feathers.
[50:50.630 --> 50:51.630]  Does the chicken stuff make the soil real hot?
[50:52.630 --> 50:53.630]  Yes.
[50:54.630 --> 50:55.630]  Chicken compost,
[50:56.630 --> 50:57.630]  I cook it twice as long
[50:58.630 --> 50:59.630]  as just regular vegetable compost.
[51:00.630 --> 51:01.630]  Okay.
[51:02.630 --> 51:03.630]  All right.
[51:04.630 --> 51:05.630]  That makes sense.
[51:06.630 --> 51:07.630]  That's kind of advanced stuff.
[51:08.630 --> 51:09.630]  Don't worry if you're not caught up on that.
[51:10.630 --> 51:11.630]  We'll talk about composting way later.
[51:12.630 --> 51:13.630]  Way later in more episodes.
[51:14.630 --> 51:15.630]  It's easy though.
[51:16.630 --> 51:17.630]  Don't be afraid to start it.
[51:18.630 --> 51:19.630]  Once we've got you growing,
[51:20.630 --> 51:21.630]  we'll talk you through that.
[51:22.630 --> 51:23.630]  We mentioned some of the dry fertilizers
[51:24.630 --> 51:25.630]  that they offer and top feeding.
[51:26.630 --> 51:27.630]  Top feeding,
[51:28.630 --> 51:29.630]  I personally use pure ingredients,
[51:30.630 --> 51:31.630]  bone meal, blood meal,
[51:32.630 --> 51:33.630]  the different guanos again,
[51:34.630 --> 51:35.630]  compost, all kind of repetitive.
[51:36.630 --> 51:37.630]  Fish meal is another thing I top feed with.
[51:38.630 --> 51:39.630]  Fish bone meal actually.
[51:40.630 --> 51:41.630]  Okay.
[51:42.630 --> 51:43.630]  When it's in flowering.
[51:44.630 --> 51:45.630]  And I just,
[51:46.630 --> 51:47.630]  various amounts,
[51:48.630 --> 51:49.630]  I tend to-
[51:50.630 --> 51:51.630]  So you're mixing that up in water
[51:52.630 --> 51:53.630]  almost like your tea
[51:54.630 --> 51:55.630]  or are you sprinkling that right onto the top?
[51:56.630 --> 51:57.630]  I suppose you could do it both ways,
[51:58.630 --> 51:59.630]  but I dig it into the top fruit cell a little bit.
[52:00.630 --> 52:01.630]  Okay.
[52:02.630 --> 52:03.630]  Just use my fingers and scrape up
[52:04.630 --> 52:05.630]  a little space to get,
[52:06.630 --> 52:07.630]  sometimes I'll do,
[52:08.630 --> 52:09.630]  like the Rev talks about doing spikes.
[52:10.630 --> 52:11.630]  I was going to recommend his book
[52:12.630 --> 52:13.630]  at the end of all this.
[52:14.630 --> 52:15.630]  Yeah, it's a great book.
[52:16.630 --> 52:17.630]  It's a TLO, True Living Organics.
[52:18.630 --> 52:19.630]  Yeah.
[52:20.630 --> 52:21.630]  Shout out to the Rev Reed,
[52:22.630 --> 52:23.630]  True Living Organics.
[52:24.630 --> 52:25.630]  It's a great book.
[52:26.630 --> 52:27.630]  But yeah,
[52:28.630 --> 52:29.630]  doing the spikes where you dig a little hole
[52:30.630 --> 52:31.630]  next to the plant basically
[52:32.630 --> 52:33.630]  and you can drop the stuff down there
[52:34.630 --> 52:35.630]  and your ingredients down in there
[52:36.630 --> 52:37.630]  and you can eat it.
[52:38.630 --> 52:39.630]  That makes sense.
[52:40.630 --> 52:41.630]  And then you water that in
[52:42.630 --> 52:43.630]  and it kind of becomes part-
[52:44.630 --> 52:45.630]  Yeah, okay.
[52:46.630 --> 52:47.630]  It's all natural like the earth.
[52:48.630 --> 52:49.630]  Now instead of force feeding it,
[52:50.630 --> 52:51.630]  you're actually letting it eat.
[52:52.630 --> 52:53.630]  Yeah.
[52:54.630 --> 52:55.630]  Okay.
[52:56.630 --> 52:57.630]  Now if that's something
[52:58.630 --> 52:59.630]  that you're a little scared of
[53:00.630 --> 53:01.630]  but you still feel like your plant
[53:02.630 --> 53:03.630]  needs something extra,
[53:04.630 --> 53:05.630]  the dry fertilizer packs
[53:06.630 --> 53:07.630]  are a great way to do it.
[53:08.630 --> 53:09.630]  Yeah, as long as it's not
[53:10.630 --> 53:11.630]  anything from Scott's or Miracle-Gro
[53:12.630 --> 53:13.630]  or anything made by Monsanto.
[53:14.630 --> 53:15.630]  You don't want really high ratios
[53:16.630 --> 53:17.630]  of nitrogen in your stuff.
[53:18.630 --> 53:19.630]  You don't want that long-lasting
[53:20.630 --> 53:21.630]  slow dispersal shit.
[53:22.630 --> 53:23.630]  You want natural stuff.
[53:24.630 --> 53:25.630]  Go to a hydroponic store,
[53:26.630 --> 53:27.630]  not the hardware store.
[53:28.630 --> 53:29.630]  It's not the garden center.
[53:30.630 --> 53:31.630]  It's at the hydro shop.
[53:32.630 --> 53:33.630]  Or mom and pop's garden store.
[53:34.630 --> 53:35.630]  Yeah, they will have it.
[53:36.630 --> 53:37.630]  You can go in there and tell them.
[53:38.630 --> 53:39.630]  They'll kick you.
[53:40.630 --> 53:41.630]  I hope they kick you out.
[53:42.630 --> 53:43.630]  Be discreet, be a pro.
[53:44.630 --> 53:45.630]  Go in there, buy stuff
[53:46.630 --> 53:47.630]  for your tomato plants.
[53:48.630 --> 53:49.630]  You don't even have to talk
[53:50.630 --> 53:51.630]  about what you're growing.
[53:52.630 --> 53:53.630]  You just need to talk about
[53:54.630 --> 53:55.630]  what you need to buy.
[53:56.630 --> 53:57.630]  Ask where that is,
[53:58.630 --> 53:59.630]  where this is, how much is this.
[54:00.630 --> 54:01.630]  Thank you, have a great day.
[54:02.630 --> 54:03.630]  Don't go a lot.
[54:04.630 --> 54:05.630]  Try not to go to the hydro shop
[54:06.630 --> 54:07.630]  or the hardware store.
[54:08.630 --> 54:09.630]  I would order online and do discreet.
[54:10.630 --> 54:11.630]  That's probably your best bet.
[54:12.630 --> 54:13.630]  All right, if you live in
[54:14.630 --> 54:15.630]  North Carolina or South Dakota.
[54:16.630 --> 54:17.630]  Missouri.
[54:18.630 --> 54:19.630]  Missouri.
[54:20.630 --> 54:21.630]  Spence says order online.
[54:22.630 --> 54:23.630]  Don't go to the store
[54:24.630 --> 54:25.630]  because you're asking for trouble.
[54:26.630 --> 54:27.630]  All right, that's good advice.
[54:28.630 --> 54:29.630]  Even in Colorado,
[54:30.630 --> 54:31.630]  I try not to be parked outside
[54:32.630 --> 54:33.630]  of there too often.
[54:34.630 --> 54:35.630]  Not just the law enforcement,
[54:36.630 --> 54:37.630]  but by now we're just in veg.
[54:38.630 --> 54:39.630]  If this is the shows today,
[54:40.630 --> 54:41.630]  we're in veg, we're just
[54:42.630 --> 54:43.630]  vegging and chilling out.
[54:44.630 --> 54:45.630]  What do we need to worry about next?
[54:46.630 --> 54:47.630]  What's coming up in the next
[54:48.630 --> 54:49.630]  couple of weeks?
[54:50.630 --> 54:51.630]  Let's see where we are.
[54:52.630 --> 54:53.630]  I have a really hectic life lately.
[54:54.630 --> 54:55.630]  More likely you're just
[54:56.630 --> 54:57.630]  in the ground.
[54:58.630 --> 54:59.630]  Plants are really starting
[55:00.630 --> 55:01.630]  to take off, get their feet
[55:02.630 --> 55:03.630]  in the ground.
[55:04.630 --> 55:05.630]  I'm putting out flowers
[55:06.630 --> 55:07.630]  and alfalfa in teas right now.
[55:08.630 --> 55:09.630]  Alfalfa mill.
[55:10.630 --> 55:11.630]  It's high in nitrogen.
[55:12.630 --> 55:13.630]  Be careful with it.
[55:14.630 --> 55:15.630]  I can't burn your plants.
[55:16.630 --> 55:17.630]  Blood mill is,
[55:18.630 --> 55:19.630]  you could be top dressed
[55:20.630 --> 55:21.630]  in some blood mill.
[55:22.630 --> 55:23.630]  Getting your cages ready.
[55:24.630 --> 55:25.630]  Okay.
[55:26.630 --> 55:27.630]  Making sure they're watered
[55:28.630 --> 55:29.630]  and happy.
[55:30.630 --> 55:31.630]  You can start training.
[55:32.630 --> 55:33.630]  We're not going to go into flower
[55:34.630 --> 55:35.630]  until August, right?
[55:36.630 --> 55:37.630]  July, August.
[55:38.630 --> 55:39.630]  We got a little bit
[55:40.630 --> 55:41.630]  to get stuff prepared.
[55:42.630 --> 55:43.630]  If you're just now getting
[55:44.630 --> 55:45.630]  outside, you're all right.
[55:46.630 --> 55:47.630]  You'll have some little plants.
[55:48.630 --> 55:49.630]  I don't even have all my
[55:50.630 --> 55:51.630]  plants out yet.
[55:52.630 --> 55:53.630]  I've got one.
[55:54.630 --> 55:55.630]  I saw your rando outdoor.
[55:56.630 --> 55:57.630]  That's crazy.
[55:58.630 --> 55:59.630]  You got to do it every year?
[56:00.630 --> 56:01.630]  I don't even know how I got there.
[56:02.630 --> 56:03.630]  I walked outside and they were
[56:04.630 --> 56:05.630]  like, you have a plant growing
[56:06.630 --> 56:07.630]  in your house.
[56:08.630 --> 56:09.630]  It's either a random S1
[56:10.630 --> 56:11.630]  or something like that.
[56:12.630 --> 56:13.630]  That's what I would guess.
[56:14.630 --> 56:15.630]  She already looks female to me.
[56:16.630 --> 56:17.630]  She looks good.
[56:18.630 --> 56:19.630]  Now that I know when they're
[56:20.630 --> 56:21.630]  going to start flowering
[56:22.630 --> 56:23.630]  at the end of July,
[56:24.630 --> 56:25.630]  I think I'm going to go out
[56:26.630 --> 56:27.630]  there and fuck with her a little
[56:28.630 --> 56:29.630]  bit.
[56:29.630 --> 56:30.630]  Top her up a little bit.
[56:31.630 --> 56:32.630]  Try not to top and fuck
[56:33.630 --> 56:34.630]  with your plants too much.
[56:34.630 --> 56:35.630]  When they go into that stretch
[56:36.630 --> 56:37.630]  phase, you may not
[56:38.630 --> 56:39.630]  understand what I'm talking
[56:40.630 --> 56:41.630]  about now, but once it happens,
[56:42.630 --> 56:43.630]  you'll know.
[56:44.630 --> 56:45.630]  That's your last chance.
[56:46.630 --> 56:47.630]  Pretty much you're done topping.
[56:48.630 --> 56:49.630]  Go ahead and get the super crop
[56:50.630 --> 56:51.630]  in there.
[56:52.630 --> 56:53.630]  Me and Spence were just talking
[56:54.630 --> 56:55.630]  about that.
[56:55.630 --> 56:56.630]  Super cropping.
[56:57.630 --> 56:58.630]  That's something I learned from
[56:59.630 --> 57:00.630]  Soma.
[57:01.630 --> 57:02.630]  I wish Soma would have taught
[57:02.630 --> 57:03.630]  me how to do it.
[57:04.630 --> 57:05.630]  You can just grab it and
[57:06.630 --> 57:07.630]  fucking break it.
[57:07.630 --> 57:08.630]  Bend it over to the left.
[57:09.630 --> 57:10.630]  It's going to snap and it's
[57:11.630 --> 57:12.630]  going to scare you.
[57:13.630 --> 57:14.630]  If it's a strong hardy plant
[57:15.630 --> 57:16.630]  within six hours, that will
[57:17.630 --> 57:18.630]  start growing right back up.
[57:19.630 --> 57:20.630]  Squeeze the area around.
[57:21.630 --> 57:22.630]  Just bruise to sell walls.
[57:23.630 --> 57:24.630]  If it's strong and healthy,
[57:25.630 --> 57:26.630]  it'll crunch like good celery.
[57:27.630 --> 57:28.630]  Just like good celery.
[57:29.630 --> 57:30.630]  That's a great description.
[57:30.630 --> 57:31.630]  I'm a little brutal.
[57:32.630 --> 57:33.630]  I slap my plants around.
[57:34.630 --> 57:35.630]  Seriously, I walk through right
[57:36.630 --> 57:37.630]  before a flower when they're
[57:37.630 --> 57:38.630]  flowering.
[57:38.630 --> 57:39.630]  I walk through and just brush
[57:40.630 --> 57:41.630]  the whole top of my indoor over.
[57:42.630 --> 57:43.630]  With your arm and just smack a
[57:44.630 --> 57:45.630]  bitch?
[57:45.630 --> 57:46.630]  Yeah.
[57:46.630 --> 57:47.630]  I'm about to go home and just
[57:48.630 --> 57:49.630]  walk home.
[57:50.630 --> 57:51.630]  I'm fucking six and a half feet
[57:52.630 --> 57:53.630]  tall.
[57:53.630 --> 57:54.630]  Spence is pretty tall.
[57:55.630 --> 57:56.630]  We got these 12 feet arm spans.
[57:57.630 --> 57:58.630]  Six feet arm spans.
[57:58.630 --> 57:59.630]  I'm going to go home and just
[58:00.630 --> 58:01.630]  get my arms back.
[58:02.630 --> 58:03.630]  Let them know they're awake.
[58:04.630 --> 58:05.630]  Give me medicine.
[58:06.630 --> 58:07.630]  Let them know they're awake.
[58:08.630 --> 58:09.630]  Thank you.
[58:10.630 --> 58:11.630]  We're getting our stakes
[58:12.630 --> 58:13.630]  prepared.
[58:13.630 --> 58:14.630]  When can you come back?
[58:15.630 --> 58:16.630]  When do you think you need to
[58:17.630 --> 58:18.630]  come back and get us caught up
[58:19.630 --> 58:20.630]  with some more shit?
[58:21.630 --> 58:22.630]  We're just going to grow for a
[58:23.630 --> 58:24.630]  couple weeks.
[58:25.630 --> 58:26.630]  We're not going to flower
[58:26.630 --> 58:27.630]  forever, Mr.
[58:27.630 --> 58:28.630]  Irie.
[58:29.630 --> 58:30.630]  Please do tweet me all your
[58:31.630 --> 58:32.630]  questions or email me.
[58:33.630 --> 58:34.630]  It's all at.
[58:35.630 --> 58:36.630]  It's at I grow culture on
[58:37.630 --> 58:38.630]  Twitter.
[58:38.630 --> 58:39.630]  It's what is it?
[58:40.630 --> 58:41.630]  I grow culture at hotmail.com.
[58:42.630 --> 58:43.630]  I think will work for you.
[58:44.630 --> 58:45.630]  There's a Facebook page.
[58:46.630 --> 58:47.630]  There's plenty of ways to get in
[58:47.630 --> 58:48.630]  touch with us.
[58:49.630 --> 58:50.630]  I'll read all your stuff on the
[58:51.630 --> 58:52.630]  air.
[58:52.630 --> 58:53.630]  We'll answer all your questions.
[58:53.630 --> 58:54.630]  A lot of fun.
[58:54.630 --> 58:55.630]  I'll read all your stuff on
[58:55.630 --> 58:56.630]  Facebook.
[58:56.630 --> 58:57.630]  There's an Instagram.
[58:58.630 --> 58:59.630]  Tag us in there.
[59:00.630 --> 59:01.630]  Where do we find you on
[59:02.630 --> 59:03.630]  Instagram?
[59:03.630 --> 59:04.630]  Jesse grows.
[59:05.630 --> 59:06.630]  Where do we find you?
[59:07.630 --> 59:08.630]  Garden of Weedon.
[59:09.630 --> 59:10.630]  Garden of Weedon.
[59:11.630 --> 59:12.630]  They post some really cool
[59:13.630 --> 59:14.630]  pics.
[59:15.630 --> 59:16.630]  Some great weed pictures.
[59:17.630 --> 59:18.630]  Our bro Spence is from
[59:19.630 --> 59:20.630]  Colorado.
[59:21.630 --> 59:22.630]  He's new to Colorado.
[59:22.630 --> 59:23.630]  He's been here about a year and
[59:23.630 --> 59:24.630]  a half.
[59:25.630 --> 59:26.630]  How do you like it so far, bro?
[59:27.630 --> 59:28.630]  I love it.
[59:29.630 --> 59:30.630]  I honestly don't.
[59:31.630 --> 59:32.630]  I probably wouldn't go back
[59:33.630 --> 59:34.630]  unless things are different.
[59:35.630 --> 59:36.630]  It's so free.
[59:37.630 --> 59:38.630]  You know what I'm saying?
[59:39.630 --> 59:40.630]  That's one of the words I was
[59:40.630 --> 59:41.630]  going to say.
[59:41.630 --> 59:42.630]  It's free.
[59:43.630 --> 59:44.630]  I've come from somewhere where
[59:45.630 --> 59:46.630]  you get caught with a joint.
[59:47.630 --> 59:48.630]  I've even seen cops find crumbs
[59:49.630 --> 59:50.630]  of weed in people's car and
[59:50.630 --> 59:51.630]  take them to jail.
[59:52.630 --> 59:53.630]  Damn.
[59:54.630 --> 59:55.630]  You come out here and it's so
[59:56.630 --> 59:57.630]  much more free.
[59:58.630 --> 59:59.630]  Especially the people that are
[01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.630]  moving here for real reasons.
[01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:03.630]  Their children need the medicine
[01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:05.630]  so they have to go to the source.
[01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:07.630]  Colorado is right now a source.
[01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:09.630]  We are the source.
[01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:11.630]  I'm definitely thankful for all
[01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:13.630]  the rules that are out here.
[01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:15.630]  It's just more liberal and free.
[01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:17.630]  I know you pretty decently.
[01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:19.630]  You don't do anything stupid.
[01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:21.630]  Smoking cannabis was the only
[01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:23.630]  thing that made you a criminal
[01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:25.630]  in North Carolina.
[01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:27.630]  Do you feel completely liberated
[01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:29.630]  now?
[01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:31.630]  You're just living large now.
[01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:33.630]  There was always that worry.
[01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:35.630]  Any state you live in,
[01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:37.630]  people are going to smoke.
[01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:39.630]  It's culture.
[01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:41.630]  When you're around people that
[01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:43.630]  are smoking in illegal states,
[01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:45.630]  it can be sketchy because
[01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:47.630]  it's not a safe place.
[01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:49.630]  It's a stupid reason to get
[01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:51.630]  out of the state.
[01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:53.630]  Do you forget sometimes that
[01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:55.630]  you're in Colorado?
[01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:57.630]  When you're rolling,
[01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:59.630]  if the cops get behind you,
[01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:01.630]  you've got some weed.
[01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:03.630]  I don't like cops anyway.
[01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:05.630]  Anytime cops are around,
[01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:07.630]  it's like...
[01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:09.630]  You're still black.
[01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:11.630]  It doesn't matter what state
[01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:13.630]  you move to.
[01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:15.630]  I definitely feel like I don't
[01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:17.630]  have worries anymore about being
[01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:19.630]  high in places and stuff like
[01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:21.630]  that.
[01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:23.630]  Here, all my friends smoke pot.
[01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:25.630]  I just say random pot stuff
[01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:27.630]  out loud.
[01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:29.630]  When you go home,
[01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:31.630]  you've got to bite your tongue
[01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:33.630]  a little bit and know what
[01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:35.630]  you're saying around certain
[01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:37.630]  people.
[01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:39.630]  A lot of people know what
[01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.630]  the word weed and pot and dope
[01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:43.630]  is, which I don't like why
[01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:45.630]  people in the South think weed
[01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:47.630]  is dope, but it's their
[01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:49.630]  decision.
[01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:51.630]  People go crazy.
[01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:53.630]  They see the torch.
[01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:55.630]  They get an automatic look
[01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:57.630]  like, what are you doing?
[01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:59.630]  But then when you give them
[01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:01.630]  a dab and they get done
[01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:03.630]  coughing, it's like, holy shit,
[01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:05.630]  I'm high.
[01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:07.630]  They love you forever.
[01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:09.630]  They're dabbers.
[01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:11.630]  They sleep eight hours.
[01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:13.630]  Everything in the fridge and
[01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:15.630]  sleep eight hours and wake up
[01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:17.630]  and want to do it again.
[01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:19.630]  Even if they did have
[01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:21.630]  a good night's sleep.
[01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:23.630]  They're still going to be
[01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:25.630]  doing it.
[01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:27.630]  You were doing this before
[01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:29.630]  we were supposed to.
[01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:31.630]  Maybe we shouldn't say that.
[01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:33.630]  You might have been a grower
[01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:35.630]  before being a grower was
[01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:37.630]  appropriate.
[01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:39.630]  Do you get paranoid sometimes
[01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:41.630]  still?
[01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:43.630]  Do you forget?
[01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:45.630]  I don't really like cops,
[01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:47.630]  but I'm not scared of them.
[01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:49.630]  I actually like challenging
[01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:51.630]  people that can disprove
[01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:53.630]  a cop.
[01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:55.630]  If you get caught with some
[01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:57.630]  pot and you have your card
[01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:59.630]  and your paperwork,
[01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:01.630]  there's nothing he can really
[01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:03.630]  do as long as you're not high
[01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:05.630]  in the wrong place like
[01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:07.630]  driving.
[01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:09.630]  That's about the only place.
[01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:11.630]  You can be high anywhere else.
[01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:13.630]  My friend got kicked off the
[01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:15.630]  bus.
[01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:17.630]  He was on the Greyhound.
[01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:19.630]  They said he smelled like
[01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.630]  weed.
[01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:23.630]  That's just discrimination.
[01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:25.630]  That's when you flip on the
[01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:27.630]  bird and moon him.
[01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:29.630]  But then you still have to
[01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:31.630]  walk to wherever you're
[01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:33.630]  trying to go.
[01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:35.630]  Get every insult in you can.
[01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:37.630]  My buddy is willing and
[01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:39.630]  able.
[01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:41.630]  He's a cool bodied guy.
[01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:43.630]  What if somebody really sick
[01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:45.630]  was just fucked from going
[01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:47.630]  across the country to see
[01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:49.630]  their sick relatives?
[01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:51.630]  That's a good question.
[01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:53.630]  I don't know.
[01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:55.630]  It just comes from my
[01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:57.630]  work and my hobbies.
[01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:59.630]  But I always smell like it.
[01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:01.630]  I don't think I wouldn't
[01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:03.630]  like to smell not like it.
[01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:05.630]  I don't know what it is to
[01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:07.630]  not smell like weed.
[01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:09.630]  It's cool with me.
[01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:11.630]  Yeah, that would really suck
[01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:13.630]  if I was needing to get
[01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:15.630]  somewhere and someone didn't
[01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:17.630]  like the way I smelled.
[01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:19.630]  Absolutely.
[01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:21.630]  We've got a good 24 minutes
[01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:23.630]  here.
[01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:25.630]  Any cool things to shout out?
[01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:27.630]  We wanted to shout out
[01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:29.630]  TaskRoc.
[01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:31.630]  We're taking dabs before
[01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:33.630]  the show.
[01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:35.630]  We've got a bunch of
[01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:37.630]  titanium and we're like we
[01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:39.630]  should shout out Task on the
[01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:41.630]  show.
[01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:42.630]  So what up, Task?
[01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:44.630]  That's an official shout out
[01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:46.630]  from the three of us here
[01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:48.630]  for sure.
[01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:49.630]  He knows who you are.
[01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:51.630]  He doesn't forget your face.
[01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:53.630]  I want the highly educated
[01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:55.630]  hoverboard.
[01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:57.630]  That's his next mission.
[01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:59.630]  That's pretty awesome.
[01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:01.630]  I would ride that.
[01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:03.630]  Does it have a dab rig attached
[01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:05.630]  to it?
[01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:06.630]  Fuck yeah, it's Tasked.
[01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:08.630]  Alright, check out my
[01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:10.630]  friends at Jesse Grows on
[01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:12.630]  Twitter or Instagram.
[01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:14.630]  I don't know if he has a
[01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:16.630]  Twitter.
[01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:17.630]  Check out Spence, Garden of

[01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:23.630]  crew.
[01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:24.630]  Team Weeden.
[01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:25.630]  Who's doing the what's that
[01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:27.630]  one called?
[01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:28.630]  Mass Roots.
[01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:29.630]  Is anybody on Mass Roots?
[01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:30.630]  No, I have not.
[01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:31.630]  It looks cool.
[01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:32.630]  It looks cool.
[01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:33.630]  I have one.
[01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:34.630]  I'd never check it though.
[01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:35.630]  Yeah, I've got one.
[01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:36.630]  I posted one picture.
[01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:37.630]  I'm so overwhelmed with social
[01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:38.630]  media.
[01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:39.630]  I haven't even messed with it.
[01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:40.630]  I cannot stand Facebook.
[01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:41.630]  Stop sending me games.
[01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:42.630]  If you follow me on Facebook,
[01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:43.630]  please stop sending me games
[01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:44.630]  because I don't play it.
[01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:45.630]  Send me some seeds.
[01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:46.630]  I'll take those.
[01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:47.630]  We have real pot farms.
[01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:48.630]  We go play pot farms.
[01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:49.630]  We got the real shit happening.
[01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:50.630]  There's another one that isn't.
[01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:51.630]  Candy Crush.
[01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:52.630]  Candy Crush.
[01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:53.630]  Everybody wants you to play
[01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:54.630]  that Candy Crush saga.
[01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:55.630]  My wife gets death threats
[01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:56.630]  over her invites.
[01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:57.630]  Yeah, live what people learn.
[01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:58.630]  Never, they don't care.
[01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:59.630]  Also, there's a new Hydro store.
[01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:00.630]  Say hello if you're in the area.
[01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:01.630]  Yeah, stop in.
[01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:02.630]  Cheapest price is south of
[01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:03.630]  Denver.
[01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:04.630]  Really, honestly, best price is
[01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:05.630]  south of Denver.
[01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:06.630]  I'm not kidding.
[01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:07.630]  I'm not kidding.
[01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.630]  I'm not kidding.
[01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:09.630]  I'm not kidding.
[01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:10.630]  I'm not kidding.
[01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:11.630]  I'm not kidding.
[01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:12.630]  I'm not kidding.
[01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:13.630]  I'm not kidding.
[01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:14.630]  I'm not kidding.
[01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:15.630]  I'm not kidding.
[01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:16.630]  Really, honestly, best price
[01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:17.630]  is south of Denver.
[01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:18.630]  It's in Pueblo, Colorado
[01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:19.630]  on 4th Street.
[01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:20.630]  It's on East 4th.
[01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:23.630]  4th and, uh,
[01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:24.630]  Between Erie and Fountain.
[01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:25.630]  Okay.
[01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:28.310]  Next to, uh.
[01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:32.430]  The ice cream place right there.
[01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:33.430]  Isn't it?
[01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:34.430]  Yeah.
[01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:35.430]  And, no.
[01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:36.430]  Uh, Taco Shop.
[01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:37.430]  Do you know what it's called?
[01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:38.430]  Uh, uh, Taco ...
[01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:39.330]  How about the HYGRO Shop?
[01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:40.630]  How about the HYGRO Shop?
[01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:41.990]  HYGRO Pueblo if I said that?
[01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:43.230]  I checked out HYGRO Pueblo.
[01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:44.230]  They're not a sponsor,
[01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:45.230]  but we want to give them a shout-out.
[01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:47.230]  They got Denver pricing in Pueblo.
[01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:48.530]  They may be a sponsor here in the future.
[01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:50.230]  It sounds like people want to talk.
[01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:51.870]  Can I sponsor?
[01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:53.910]  Yeah, we can talk about that off the show.
[01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.110]  All right. Yeah. All right.
[01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:57.070]  What do you want me to say in this episode?
[01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:58.410]  It's brought to you by the Garden of Wee.
[01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:00.030]  I just want you to say shout-out to my nigga Spence
[01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:02.830]  every time the show's on.
[01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:05.570]  That's it.
[01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:07.210]  People don't even got to know who I am.
[01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:09.030]  Nobody cares. Just some dude named Spence.
[01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:10.630]  Just says what's up to you every day.
[01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:11.830]  Do I have to say my nigga?
[01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:14.710]  Because that might offend some people.
[01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:16.410]  You can say ninja to my nigga.
[01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:18.190]  Shout-out to my nigga Spence.
[01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:20.190]  That moves quicker. You know what I'm saying?
[01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:21.490]  People understand that. A little safer.
[01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:22.950]  Yeah. Yeah. We get it. We get it.
[01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:24.250]  All right. Well, I want to thank both my ninjas
[01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:25.850]  for joining us today.
[01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:27.750]  Stick around, guys.
[01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:29.750]  I'll be right back with a little bit more.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.700]  Big extra thanks to those guys for stopping by
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:40.940]  and doing a podcast with me.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.140]  They came here right after work.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:43.340]  They had shit to do.
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.440]  They took a moment out of their day
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.020]  to come and record with me.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:47.620]  Really appreciate it. Shout-out to Jesse.
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.100]  Shout-out to Spence.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.540]  Be sure to follow both of those guys on Instagram.
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.440]  All right. So, this is the part of the show
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.480]  where we give thanks to somebody
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.140]  who I believe has been crucial to the cannabis movement.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.780]  In the past, we have given thanks to people
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:04.440]  such as Mark Emery, Jack Herrer,
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.480]  Ginny Kush, Jorge Cervantes.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.520]  On this episode, I want to give a big cannabis
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.280]  thank you to Keith Stroup.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:14.760]  Mr. Keith Stroup is a Washington,
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:18.220]  D.C., public interest attorney who founded Normal in 1970.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.000]  Stroup obtained his undergraduate degree
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.620]  in political science from the University of Illinois in 1965.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:27.580]  And in 1968, he graduated from Georgetown Law School
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.300]  in Washington, D.C.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.700]  Following two years as staff counsel
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.100]  for the National Commission on Product Safety,
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.740]  Mr. Stroup founded Normal and ran the organization
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:39.380]  through 1979, during which 11 states
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:42.340]  decriminalized minor marijuana offenses.
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.720]  I should take a second and explain to you what Normal is.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.220]  Normal stands for the National Organization
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.880]  for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.440]  That's right, Mr. Stroup was the founder of this organization
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.520]  which actually was the first group I ever heard of
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.280]  as an activist group for cannabis,
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.660]  back in High Times Magazine many, many years ago.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.360]  And I actually think I saw Tommy Chong
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.100]  or somebody really famous wearing a Normal shirt.
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.700]  And I was really proud to see that.
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:11.100]  So, Keith Stroup is the founder,
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:13.100]  one of the guys that got this huge movement
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.560]  sort of public and political.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.440]  So, Stroup has also practiced criminal law,
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:20.260]  lobbied on Capitol Hill for family, farmers, and artists,
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.460]  and for several years served as executive director
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.860]  for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:28.300]  which is the NACDL, which I would have just,
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.500]  wish I would have read just that anyway.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.500]  In 1992, Stroup was the recipient
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.180]  of the Richard J. Dennis Drug Peace Award
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.380]  for outstanding achievement
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.020]  in the field of drug policy reform,
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:42.380]  presented by the Drug Policy Foundation in Washington, D.C.
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:47.320]  In 1994, Stroup resumed his work with Normal,
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.240]  rejoining the board of directors
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:53.140]  and serving again as executive director through 2004,
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:56.080]  is currently serving as legal counsel with Normal.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.920]  Mr. Stroup has appeared on numerous television shows,
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:03.420]  such as The O'Reilly Factor, Crossfire, Buchanan & Press,
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.520]  and Hannity & Combs.
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.520]  I've actually been in the same room with this guy
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.560]  at a couple of parties and events.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:12.900]  He was at the High Times Cannabis Cup
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.460]  where he received an award.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.300]  He's just such a chill dude.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.320]  He beams with energy.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.380]  He seems really smart.
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.140]  He's always got people around him.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.960]  So he speaks really well.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.120]  He seems super intelligent,
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:28.660]  but he doesn't talk to the non-suit wearing guys
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:31.460]  like they aren't just as smart as the guys in the suits,
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.780]  which I find to be really cool.
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.020]  He paved the way for stoners.
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:35.860]  He is paving the way.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:39.340]  He still helps Normal fight the fight.
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:41.660]  They're heavily involved in the legalization movement.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.940]  So I wanna give a big, huge shout to Mr. Keith Stroup.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.100]  Thank you.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:47.620]  Thank you for what you've done with Normal.
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.580]  Thank you for what you've done for the movement.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:52.140]  I'm not sure that this podcast would be possible
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:53.700]  without you.
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:54.700]  Much respect.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.220]  So that was the portion where I give thanks.
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.580]  I wanna give thanks to you guys for listening to the show.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:03.300]  We've made it through 14 episodes now.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.540]  I'll be back in just a couple of days
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:05.940]  with an episode about cloning,
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.740]  and I'll have a little bit of news for you.

[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.800]  Hey, Nikita T.
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:57.800]  You know it's Bobby Hustle here, presenting for Essential Abstracts.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.800]  Oh, it's the OG kush from the world.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.800]  Well, if I hydrate you want, you got no diggity.

[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.800]  Sour everyday, love the kush, we go with it.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.800]  Best from the West Coast, country make me shake it up.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.800]  End up a family, Bobby Hustle, feel nothing.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.800]  Anytime you see me, I hustle and shout.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:28.920]  Okay, I'm back.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.920]  I found a funny story I wanted to share with you guys in the news
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.920]  before we get down to the cloning lesson.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.920]  I found this in the Cannabis.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920]  It's written by Ricardo Baca.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.920]  I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard about this,
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:43.920]  but I found it highly entertaining and wanted to talk about it on the show.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.920]  It says, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.920]  reported direct from Colorado's bustling marijuana scene again on June 3rd,
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.920]  whereas one of the popular columnist's last pieces talked with nudist,
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.920]  420 friendly B&B owners in Denver.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.920]  This one takes readers through Dowd's scary trip on edibles.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:05.920]  So yeah, this lady bought herself some edibles here in Colorado
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.920]  and she ate them and she freaked the fuck out.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.920]  So the article says in, don't harsh our mellow dude.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:16.920]  Dowd plans a night inside her hotel room with a marijuana infused edible.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.920]  She got no guidance from the bud tender on dosage
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.920]  and she wasn't familiar with the state recommended 10 milligram dose
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.920]  regarding edibles.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.920]  She definitely didn't read our useful edibles 101,
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.920]  eight tips for getting the right dose piece.
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.920]  This guy's plugging his own stuff.
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.920]  So instead she asked what could go wrong with a bite or two?
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:37.920]  And then her trip turned into a dark downward spiral.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.920]  Dowd, have you ever eaten too many edibles?
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.920]  I have.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.920]  It's been a really long time since I've eaten too many edibles.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.920]  But when I was younger, once I made some cookies,
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.920]  I actually made them and I threw two ounces of swag weed in there
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.920]  in a brownie cookie mix for 24 cookies.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.920]  And I baked it and I made butter out of it.
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:01.920]  And then I baked it.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.920]  The butter was green and shit, but I ate some of it.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.920]  My girlfriend ate some of it and uncle ate some of it
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:07.920]  and her friend ate some of it.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.920]  And nobody went back for seconds.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.920]  Those cookies fucked us up.
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.920]  I was high for two days.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.920]  I was supposed to go to dinner that night with somebody,
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:17.920]  with some family.
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.920]  So I went over there to dinner and I just sat with my head in my hands.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.920]  And when people would talk to me, I would just look at them like,
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:23.920]  would you please shut up?
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:27.920]  Because their voices, it was annoying trying to keep up with them talking.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.920]  I felt retarded and couldn't do it.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.920]  I was like, just quit because I can't even,
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.920]  nothing they were saying was making any sense to me.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.920]  I felt like I was trapped in time or something because they would talk.
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.920]  And then by the time I'd figure out what they said,
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.920]  they were about eight sentences ahead of themselves.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.920]  I was in a bad, bad, bad way.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:48.920]  My girlfriend refused to come to dinner with me that night because she was too high.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:49.920]  She ate one of those cookies.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:50.920]  I ate two of them.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:51.920]  She ate one.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.920]  We came home and we found her.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:56.920]  Well, first of all,
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.920]  she called me to ask if she could swallow the lining of her mouth,
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.920]  which I think she meant her mouth.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:03.920]  Maybe her tongue.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.920]  I don't know what she meant, but she was super high.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.920]  And we came home and found her crawling up the stairs.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.920]  And my uncle, he, uh, he's a 325 pound guy.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.920]  He had a couple of those cookies and his eyes were red,
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.920]  like brick red for two days straight.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.920]  He said he'd never wanted to be that high again.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.920]  Those cookies.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.920]  I don't know if it was the swag weed.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:28.920]  I don't know if there was something else in there.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.920]  We were wrecked, but it was, it was no fun to be that high.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.920]  This poor lady's never consumed cannabis as far as I know.
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.920]  And she is laying in a hotel room having eaten way too much of a weed
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.920]  edible and she just flipping out.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.920]  So let's read a little bit more about what she says.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.920]  Remember her last statement was, uh,
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.920]  what could go wrong with a bite or two?
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.920]  And then her trip turned into a dark downward spiral.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.920]  But then I felt a scary shutter go through my body and brain.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:59.920]  I barely made it from the desk to the bed where I lay curled up in a
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.920]  hallucinatory state for the next eight hours.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.920]  I was thirsty, but couldn't move my body.
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.920]  I was thirsty, but couldn't move to get water or even turn off the lights.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:09.920]  I was panting and paranoid.
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:10.920]  Sure.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.920]  That when, when the room service waiter knocked and I didn't answer,
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.920]  he'd call the police and have me arrested for being unable to handle my candy.
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:19.920]  So this lady's flipping out.
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:20.920]  She's so thirsty.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:21.920]  She can't reach for water.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.920]  She's can't even turn off the lights.
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:25.920]  She's laying there panting and paranoid.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:29.920]  I've been in a room with a girl who was this high and God,
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:30.920]  it was hard to calm her down.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.920]  And she just wanted to do all the wrong.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:34.920]  Uh, she wanted to go out in public.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:35.920]  She wanted to call people.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.920]  And I was like, no, you just gotta be high right here.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.920]  Just keep this high.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:39.920]  And you're a little bubble.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:40.920]  Don't up the rest of your life.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.920]  Just keep it contained.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.920]  Sometimes it's a struggle to keep those kinds of folks in the right state of
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.920]  mind.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.920]  So the lady says I strained to remember where I was or even what I was wearing,
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.920]  touching my green corduroy jeans and staring at the exposed brick wall.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920]  As my paranoia deepened,
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:00.920]  I became convinced that I had died and no one was telling me.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.920]  So she said she was straining to remember where she was and what she was
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:06.920]  wearing, but she vividly seems to remember, uh,
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:09.920]  touching green corduroy jeans and a brick wall.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.920]  So she never would have noticed that stuff.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:12.920]  If she hadn't gotten all fucked up,
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.920]  she was introduced to some new things in life.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:16.920]  Poor lady.
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.920]  Uh, she was paranoid and freaking out.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:23.920]  She thought she was convinced that she had died and nobody was telling her.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.920]  Just imagine sitting there in a hotel room by herself, thinking you're dead.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.920]  Just thinking that you're dead.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.920]  And what do you do?
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.920]  You're just going to wait for housekeeping to come find you dead and lay
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.920]  there.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.920]  Oh, that had to be the worst fucking eight hours of her life.
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:39.920]  So it says, this is hardly the first newspaper columnist to eat too many
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.920]  edibles and land in a dark place.
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:43.920]  At least dad didn't up in the,
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.920]  didn't end up in the hospital after a weird trip like Pittsburgh post-gazette
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.920]  columnist, McKenzie Carpenter.
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.920]  I might read that article next.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.920]  We'll open that up in another tab.
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:52.920]  We'll see what happened to her.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:54.920]  I'll skim through it and see if it's worth reading.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:56.920]  All right. I'll keep going on this one though.
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.920]  Dad goes on in her piece to reference the two deaths,
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.920]  Denver police are linking to edible marijuana,
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.920]  a college student who jumped to his death and the observatory park,
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.920]  man who hallucinated and allegedly shot and killed his wife.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.920]  And you're going to say, why didn't you talk about those?
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:15.920]  I didn't want to give more hype to the people that they're trying to link
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:18.920]  these deaths to cannabis. I didn't want to push that story even more.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.920]  I thought it was getting enough press. I chose to ignore that.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.920]  I apologize if you feel left out. That was my responsibility.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.920]  I thought it was my responsibility to keep my mouth shut on that one,
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.920]  but it's related. So we're talking to it or about it.
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.920]  So she addresses issues of edible packaging, uh,
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:40.920]  presentation and potency. And she asks if incredibles co-owner Bob is paranoid,
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.920]  but Dow's most pressing observation is the call in the column was a plea for
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.920]  more regulations and warnings to the casual user.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.920]  I reckoned that the fact that it was not a regular marijuana smoker made me
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.920]  more vulnerable and that I should have known better.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:59.920]  But it turns out five months in some kinks need to be ironed out with the
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.920]  intoxicating open bar at the mile high club.
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:07.920]  Oh, so there's a lot of stuff going on and people are coming here and doing
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:08.920]  stuff like this.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.920]  They're going to start kind of making the rules a little tighter for the guys
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.920]  like us that know what we're doing. So check it out. If you come to Colorado,
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.920]  please, if you get an edible, that's got a hundred milligrams,
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:24.920]  I'm serious. Eat a 10th of it. One 10th. If you're new at edibles,
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.920]  you're going to say, I smoke weed every day. Cool.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.920]  You don't smoke Colorado weed every day and you don't eat Colorado edibles
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.920]  every day. These things are made for people with cancer, leukemia,
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.920]  glaucoma, Crohn's disease, AIDS.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.920]  So people are really trying to medicate with these.
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:47.920]  These aren't candies to be fucked with. Take them seriously. Respect them.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:50.920]  Eat a 10th of it. You don't feel anything, feel anything.
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:51.920]  You can eat more.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.920]  If you end up curled up in the fucking corner in your hotel room,
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:55.920]  you're going to be like, damn,
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:58.920]  I should've listened to Rasta Jeff on that podcast and only eating a little bit
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.920]  of that thing. Have some respect for the edibles.
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:05.920]  Have some respect for Colorado. Have some respect for yourself. Be safe.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.920]  So I said, I was going to click on that other article. We'll see what happens.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.920]  Sorry. I'm getting a little cold. It's a rainy night in Colorado.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:15.920]  I left the window open. It got shivery here where I'm recording.
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.920]  I'm going to skim this article. The, uh,
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.920]  the headline is Saturday diary, dumb and dumber,
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.920]  getting a mile high in Colorado.
[01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:36.510]  All right. I read that article just as I suspected.
[01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:40.510]  Some lady came from another state, her and her friends split a, uh, candy bar.
[01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:43.510]  It was a mile high candy bar. Actually it was a hundred milligrams.
[01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:48.510]  They didn't realize such, uh, she was at the pot shop to be novel.
[01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:50.510]  She bought a joint to be cute. Her friend bought an edible.
[01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:54.510]  They split the edible. Uh, they both went to dinner.
[01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:58.510]  Her friend fainted because she was so high. Her friend got all freaked out.
[01:23:58.510 --> 01:24:02.510]  They ended up at the hospital and the guy at the doctor at the hospital said
[01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:06.510]  this happens every single day because of edibles and the lady kind of made a big
[01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:08.510]  deal about it. So that's the basic part of that story.
[01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:12.510]  She got too up just another case of exactly what we are talking about.
[01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:15.510]  All right guys, I'm going to go find a hoodie. I'm getting a little bit cold.
[01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:18.510]  Guess what I'm going to do. I'm going to take a dab while I'm finding that hoodie.
[01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:22.510]  And then we're going to come back and we're going to learn how to cut some clones.
[01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:23.510]  Hang in there for me.
[01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:29.510]  Oh my God. I just hit my funny bone. Why do they call that thing?
[01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:31.510]  The fucking funny bone. That's not fucking funny at all.
[01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:36.510]  My fingers are numb. Oh God. Oh, all right.
[01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:39.510]  It's going to take a little longer than I thought. I'll be back. Hold on.
[01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:53.510]  I'm still on sale. Ain't no corruption. I just don't dwell.
[01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:58.510]  Like a tearing champion sound. You know, we beat the clown. Murder!
[01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:01.510]  All right guys, I am back. Got a hoodie. Took a couple of dabs.
[01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:03.510]  I'm feeling better now. A couple episodes ago,
[01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:06.510]  we did a crash course in germinating seeds and getting seeds into the soil to
[01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:08.510]  get started. If you guys started seeds,
[01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:10.510]  you should have little sprouts popping up out of the dirt and everything
[01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:13.510]  should be growing off to a good start. Looking happy.
[01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:16.510]  One thing I didn't talk enough about was the light schedule for your new
[01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:18.510]  seedlings. A T5 light is perfect.
[01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:21.510]  I use a 24 hour light cycle when my plants are small.
[01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:24.510]  I don't let them sleep until they get a little bit bigger.
[01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:27.510]  Like I said, T5s are perfect for that.
[01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:30.510]  Metal halide lamp is perfect for that. You don't need anything big.
[01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:34.510]  Like a 400 watt is almost overkill to start your seeds.
[01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:37.510]  You can start them under a thousand, but it's not necessary at all.
[01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:40.510]  T5 lights are perfect for that little fluorescence.
[01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:43.510]  So the guys that you people that started seedlings,
[01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:46.510]  you can kick back and let your babies grow while we teach everyone how to
[01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:49.510]  take a clone, but pay attention because you're going to be taking clones from
[01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:53.510]  that plant that grows from that seed here in about two months.
[01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:54.510]  All right.
[01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:57.510]  So I feel like if we cut clones this week and we let them get rooted over the
[01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:58.510]  next couple of weeks,
[01:25:58.510 --> 01:26:02.510]  we should have clones and seedlings caught up about the same size and ready
[01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:04.510]  for veg here in just a couple of more episodes.
[01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:09.510]  So now let's talk about taking a clone from a mother or a donor plant.
[01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:14.510]  A mother plant is a plant that's kept in veg indefinitely so that we can take
[01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:16.510]  cuttings from it at any time.
[01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:20.510]  If you keep that plant under 24 hours of light or 18 hours of light,
[01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:22.510]  it won't flower. If you treat it well,
[01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:26.510]  if you prevent it from getting root bound and you top it and take clones from
[01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:29.510]  it every so often that plant will stay in veg.
[01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:32.510]  So you'll always have it available because it's great to have a reliable,
[01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:34.510]  dependable strain around it.
[01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:37.510]  That's how you hear about all the strains that are your favorites.
[01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:40.510]  Those are kept around as a mother plant by somebody who has given them out in
[01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:44.510]  clone form. So a bunch of people now have those clones, the tangy,
[01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:48.510]  the gorilla glue, somebody somewhere discovered the gorilla glue or even Girl
[01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:49.510]  Scout cookies.
[01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:52.510]  Somebody discovered the Girl Scout cookies and some seeds they had.
[01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:55.510]  They gave out a clone of that. Somebody gave,
[01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:58.510]  they let it grow into a mother plant. They took a clone of that and gave it out.
[01:26:58.510 --> 01:27:00.510]  Now those strains are all over.
[01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:05.510]  Girl Scout cookies is available from California to New York now because of
[01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:07.510]  clones and cuttings and mother plants.
[01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:10.510]  So if you keep that mother plant in veg forever,
[01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:14.510]  then this strain will exist forever. You can always go to that mother plant,
[01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:18.510]  cut enough clones off of it to fill up your flower room and then you can keep
[01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:22.510]  growing more crops and more crops of Girl Scout cookies or gorilla glue or
[01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:26.510]  grateful dog or whatever it is that you've grown from seed or gotten a clone
[01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:28.510]  of. You can keep it going forever that way.
[01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:31.510]  Some people are going to ask why they shouldn't grow from seed every time they
[01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:32.510]  start a new grow.
[01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:36.510]  Well, the reason for that is because seeds do show genetic variation.
[01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:38.510]  There will be different phenotypes,
[01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:40.510]  which is something we'll talk about in a later episode,
[01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:43.510]  but not all seeds are going to look the same.
[01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:45.510]  Imagine your brothers and sisters don't all look the same,
[01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:47.510]  but they came from the same parents.
[01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:49.510]  You're the same seed stock,
[01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:52.510]  but you look just a little bit different than each other because that's the way
[01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:53.510]  that genetics work.
[01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:57.510]  So it's good to have a clone of something that you've ran and trusted and you
[01:27:57.510 --> 01:28:01.510]  know is reliable because medical patients are limited to a certain amount of
[01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:02.510]  plants.
[01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:05.510]  And if you're running plants that are not going to be what you need in the end,
[01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:07.510]  you kind of might be wasting space.
[01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:12.510]  I heavily encourage seed running because I do like finding those genetic
[01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:14.510]  differences, but I've got space.
[01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:16.510]  I'm an experienced grower.
[01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:18.510]  So once you're comfortable with it,
[01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:20.510]  I definitely encourage you to do some seeds,
[01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:23.510]  but let's get back to talking about mother plants.
[01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:28.510]  The easiest way to find a mother plant is to get a clone that's been tested and
[01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:29.510]  proven. You want to know that it's a female.
[01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:31.510]  You want to know that it's dank, good medicine.
[01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:34.510]  You want to know that it grows without any trouble.
[01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:37.510]  So usually if you get it from a shop or a fellow grower or a breeder,
[01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:38.510]  your clones are going to be solid.
[01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:42.510]  One thing I should mention that it's your responsibility to take a new clone
[01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:45.510]  that you got from somebody and make sure there are no bugs on it.
[01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:49.510]  You can't get a clone from somebody and then blame them for having given you
[01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:52.510]  bugs later on. If you get mites or white flies from a clone,
[01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:55.510]  that's like not having safe sex.
[01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:57.510]  You can't blame it on the person that gave that shit to you.
[01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:59.510]  You should have been taking care of that shit in advance.
[01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:01.510]  So be careful with the clone that comes in.
[01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:06.510]  There are plenty of ways to treat for spider mites, for white flies, for anything.
[01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:07.510]  You should come up with a good regimen.
[01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:10.510]  Maybe that's something we'll talk about on a future episode as a way to get rid
[01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:13.510]  of and prevent bugs on incoming clones.
[01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:17.510]  One way to do it is to grow from seed, but let's get back to clones again.
[01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:20.510]  Now, once you've got your clone and it's healthy and bug free,
[01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:24.510]  transplant your little clone into a large pot.
[01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:27.510]  I wouldn't use any smaller than a five gallon pot for a mother plant.
[01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:32.510]  So get into a five gallon pot, keep it under 24 hours or 18 hours of light.
[01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:33.510]  Some people do 18, some do 24.
[01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:35.510]  I like to keep my mothers under 24 hours of light.
[01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:36.510]  That's my personal preference.
[01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:41.510]  I feel like they grow way fast and they like to give me lots of cuttings and
[01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:42.510]  they look really healthy.
[01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:45.510]  So take that little baby that somebody gave you, put it in a,
[01:29:46.510 --> 01:29:50.510]  let it get good and rooted. Put it in a five gallon pot, let it grow, you know,
[01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:52.510]  let it get quite a few nodes on it. Let it get growing.
[01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:56.510]  And then you're going to want to take the top right out of it. Boom.
[01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:58.510]  That's your first cutting that you're going to want to take.
[01:29:58.510 --> 01:30:01.510]  You're going to kind of want to even out the height of that plant so that every
[01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:03.510]  node starts growing up to be the same size.
[01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:05.510]  Uh, training a mother plant,
[01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:09.510]  how to grow by pruning it properly is an art that will take you a few plants of
[01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:13.510]  making them look super ugly before you catch on, but that's all right.
[01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:19.510]  Something I do about once every year, I re-mom all of my mothers.
[01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:22.510]  So I'll take my mother plant and I'll take six or seven cuttings off of it.
[01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:27.510]  And then I'll take the best one of that and I'll root it or I'll get it in a
[01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:28.510]  cup. I'll get it grown. I'll get it into a pot.
[01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:31.510]  And that becomes my new mother plant for the next year so that I have a nice
[01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:34.510]  healthy plant because they, I feel like they start getting there.
[01:30:34.510 --> 01:30:36.510]  They get root bound. They get old, they get tired.
[01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:38.510]  These plants are only meant to live for a year.
[01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:41.510]  So if you try to keep it around for too long, it will kind of lose its vigor.
[01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:44.510]  So I re-clone it and put some youth back into it.
[01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:49.510]  So that's how you could pretty much take a clone that you're given or bought
[01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:52.510]  from a shop and turn it into your very first mother plant.
[01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:56.510]  Now a lot of people don't have access to that, so they're going to have to run
[01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:59.510]  seeds. And I was talking about that genetic
[01:30:59.510 --> 01:31:01.510]  variation from seeds. You're not guaranteed of what you're
[01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:07.510]  going to get unless somebody's taken it to the F4 or F5 stage, which that is a
[01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:09.510]  whole nother podcast we'll talk about later.
[01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:12.510]  So if you don't have access to good clones, you're going to need to get some
[01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:14.510]  seeds and run some seeds to find your mother plant.
[01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:19.510]  What I usually do is I run a pack of seeds, usually between 10 and 50 seeds,
[01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:21.510]  depending on the strain and what I'm looking for.
[01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:24.510]  I grow those seeds out and I pay very close attention to the veg growth because
[01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:27.510]  veg growth is really important to me. I need it to be a good grower.
[01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:31.510]  I would like to pay attention to the way each phenotype branches out.
[01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:33.510]  I like to pay attention to the rate it grows.
[01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:38.510]  I like to pay attention to how many nodes and how many little, little flower
[01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:41.510]  sites, or not flower sites, but they will be flower sites.
[01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:45.510]  How many of those develop in a little cluster area along the branches?
[01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:47.510]  I like to pay attention.
[01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:53.510]  So I'm super careful to feed each plant and treat each plant the same so that I
[01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:56.510]  can see what each plant has to offer without messing it up by doing something
[01:31:56.510 --> 01:32:01.510]  different. If it's nutrients or training or trimming or topping or whatever,
[01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:02.510]  I treat each one the same.
[01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:07.510]  So I mix up enough nutrients in one bucket to feed all of them or in one
[01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:10.510]  res to feed all of these little seedlings and I feed them all the exact same
[01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:15.510]  shit. I try to rotate them under the light so that nobody gets like one spot
[01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:18.510]  of the light has, maybe has better lumens there. I make sure that doesn't happen.
[01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:21.510]  I make sure they get moved around so that everybody's kind of treated the same.
[01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:26.510]  I don't show any favoritism. Once they're big enough to give me a few cuttings,
[01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:30.510]  I take a cutting or a clone from each plant and I carefully labeled the plants
[01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:36.510]  and I labeled the cuttings. So I'll take, I'm super careful.
[01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:39.510]  I take plant A and clone A and make sure to label those.
[01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:43.510]  So you got your big mother plant is plant A. You got your little clone is clone A.
[01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:47.510]  And then you got plant B, clone B, all the way down to however many you got.
[01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:49.510]  You can do them by number. You can name them.
[01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:52.510]  I've got a friend who names them after old ladies for some reason.
[01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:55.510]  I've got friends that name them after cartoon characters.
[01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:58.510]  I always seem to name my stuff after Grateful Dead songs.
[01:32:58.510 --> 01:33:02.510]  Just something, something that means something to you. Letters and numbers work.
[01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:06.510]  But once I see what my, that my clones are going to root
[01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:09.510]  and I'm safe to flower out that original seedling plant,
[01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:11.510]  I flower it out and see what I get from them.
[01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:14.510]  Now, a lot of people will keep that original plant around as a mother plant.
[01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:18.510]  That seedling plant that you planted, a lot of people, I believe so as well.
[01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:21.510]  It's got more vigor. It's a stronger plant.
[01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:26.510]  So they want to keep that one around as a mother and not flower that one out.
[01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:29.510]  They'll wait for those other clones that they took to root and then they'll flower those.
[01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:32.510]  But I think I save time by blooming out the original plant.
[01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:34.510]  It's already grown and ready to go.
[01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:36.510]  And I do a technique called lollipopping anyway.
[01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:40.510]  I take the bottoms off of the plants where the light's not going to penetrate.
[01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:42.510]  Those little bottom branches, I cut those off.
[01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:45.510]  Because I feel like if the light's not going to penetrate down there,
[01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:47.510]  there's no reason to really have that on there.
[01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:52.510]  It's just going to take energy from the tops where I could build big, fat, heady nuggets.
[01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:56.510]  And there's, I've learned how to grow plants with no larv, no little tiny bud anymore.
[01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:58.510]  All my stuff is big and chunky.
[01:33:58.510 --> 01:34:01.510]  Just by doing a little bit of pruning like that.
[01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:05.510]  So, yeah, I'll take a couple clones from that area.
[01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:08.510]  And I think those make great clones and flower that original seedling plant.
[01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:12.510]  Some people are against that, but that's just, I have great experience doing it.
[01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:13.510]  It's already grown. It's already grown.
[01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:16.510]  You've already put a couple months into it. You've got clones of it. You're cool.
[01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:21.510]  But during the flowering process, sometimes I'll even pull out plants early if they show signs of weakness.
[01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:25.510]  I've seen plants that just grow really wispy, really weak.
[01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:27.510]  Maybe I was throwing away the wrong shit.
[01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:31.510]  But I need stuff that breeds heavily and that grows solid.
[01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:34.510]  So I don't want to be playing with those little weak bitches.
[01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:38.510]  Just the way we do it. We practice eugenics in the breeding room. Definitely, definitely.
[01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:43.510]  I isolate males or hermaphrodites go immediately.
[01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:47.510]  If it shows signs of hermaphrodism, I throw that sucker away really quickly.
[01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:49.510]  We'll talk more about hermaphrodites on another show, I guess.
[01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:55.510]  I isolate the males. And if I'm not looking for a male to breed, I throw the males away as soon as I identify them.
[01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:59.510]  If I'm looking for a breeding male, I already had that in mind when I planted those seeds.
[01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:02.510]  I've got some seeds down right now that I'm hoping for a male.
[01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:05.510]  I'm hoping for three to five males out of one of those packs.
[01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:07.510]  I'm hoping for three to choose from.
[01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:11.510]  Selecting a male is a fun process in my opinion.
[01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:14.510]  So anyway, you guys should throw away your males if you're new.
[01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:16.510]  You don't want to have the males around. Those are going to create pollen.
[01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:20.510]  Those are going to put seeds in all your crop, which is probably not what you want at this point.
[01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:26.510]  So at this point, if I throw away a male or a shitty plant, I also toss all the clones.
[01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:30.510]  And that way you just took your numbers down.
[01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:35.510]  One thing I should mention about, or I should talk about,
[01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:39.510]  you should plant, if you can, plant as many seeds as you think you're able to handle.
[01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:43.510]  You need a vegging plant, a clone, and a flowering plant.
[01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:46.510]  So think about whatever you're doing with that seedling, you're going to need three versions of those.
[01:35:46.510 --> 01:35:51.510]  So if you're able to have 15 plants, plant five. If you're ready to have six, I guess only plant two.
[01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:54.510]  A lot of guys forget that they're going to take clones.
[01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:56.510]  They're going to have a mother plant. They need plants and veg.
[01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:58.510]  They're going to have plants and flower.
[01:35:58.510 --> 01:36:01.510]  So just try to keep in mind how many plants you're going to end up with.
[01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:04.510]  Because it's going to be like anything else you fall in love with.
[01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:05.510]  You're going to be like, I need a plant.
[01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:08.510]  And then pretty soon you're going to be like, I need a room.
[01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:10.510]  And then you're going to be like, I need a facility.
[01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:13.510]  And then we've seen how it goes. You're on the internet too.
[01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:18.510]  So I would say plant as many seeds as you think you can safely and legally handle.
[01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:21.510]  But plant one extra because some shit's going to die.
[01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:23.510]  Something's going to fail. Just plant one extra.
[01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:25.510]  You're going to have to think about space and stuff.
[01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:28.510]  Plant ahead. That's something that I like to stress when we're growing here.
[01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:31.510]  So we'll let the best looking plants finish.
[01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:34.510]  Now, don't be shy. Don't be afraid.
[01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:39.510]  Like if you don't like the way something grows, if a plant is really pissing you off, cut that thing down.
[01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:42.510]  We're going to grow more weed in the future. It's not the end.
[01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:46.510]  Some people are going to cringe because maybe you just cut down the greatest plant ever.
[01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:49.510]  But as a new grower, don't worry, you'll move on.
[01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:51.510]  I've cut down. I've lost strains that I miss.
[01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:53.510]  And you know what? I've bred more. I've grown more.
[01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:56.510]  I've forgotten all about them until now that I'm talking about it.
[01:36:56.510 --> 01:37:01.510]  So I usually harvest, trim and cure the plants and smoke all of them myself.
[01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:04.510]  Not all of it, but I smoke a little bit of each plant myself.
[01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:07.510]  I also take a couple of samples of each phenotype.
[01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:10.510]  And I give them to friends to help me decide which is best for them.
[01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:16.510]  I'm a medical marijuana provider, so I have a great team of testers for me that will smoke and take good notes.
[01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:20.510]  I've given them a little chart to fill out for me to tell me what they think of each strain.
[01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:24.510]  And I don't tell them what it is. I just label it A, B, C, D or whatever.
[01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:26.510]  And they tell me what they think of each one.
[01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:31.510]  And then usually I agree. I usually know what they're going to want me to keep.
[01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:32.510]  So I let those guys smoke it.
[01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:37.510]  Once I've narrowed it down to a few of my favorites, I take them to a lab for testing.
[01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:41.510]  I take all of them, but honestly the labs are a little bit expensive and it's two hours away.
[01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:46.510]  And I think it's better for me to let the smokers narrow it down because they know more than the numbers do.
[01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:48.510]  They know more than the machines.
[01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:50.510]  And that's who I'm growing it for is the people that are smoking it.
[01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:53.510]  I'm not trying to just grow for high numbers.
[01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:58.510]  Sometimes I like the plant that actually has lower numbers.
[01:37:58.510 --> 01:38:03.510]  Those guys like the flavor or something of a plant with lower numbers.
[01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.510]  And I think I can usually predict the high testers.
[01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:08.510]  I've said this plant is going to test high or this one doesn't.
[01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:10.510]  And I'm usually right.
[01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:13.510]  To give you guys an idea of what some of the stuff has been testing at,
[01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:17.510]  I'm going to pull up a PDF I have here on my Macbook.
[01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:20.510]  I just have to find it right quick. I've got a lot of stuff going on here.
[01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:25.510]  This is, um, these tests were done just a couple of, maybe a month ago.
[01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:28.510]  It's opening the PDF right now. It's taking its sweet time.
[01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:30.510]  So I grew, I bred a strain called Lemon Jeffrey.
[01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:33.510]  It's actually a lemon skunk crossed a golden goat.
[01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:39.510]  And she tested at 24.34 THC. That's kind of a high test.
[01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:43.510]  Let me find another one for you here.
[01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:49.510]  The Capelton, that's the white widow times grateful dog.
[01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:52.510]  Got to blow it up. It's real small here on the screen.
[01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:57.510]  That one is 20.58% THC.
[01:38:57.510 --> 01:39:00.510]  So that's kind of what we're testing in the twenties.
[01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:02.510]  Got the grateful dog here also.
[01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:07.510]  Grateful dog. She tested at 23.32% THC.
[01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:10.510]  So those are, that's kind of what some things are coming out at.
[01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:14.510]  They said at the lab, anything over 17% THC is actually impressive.
[01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:17.510]  So that means we're doing some stuff right over here.
[01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:20.510]  I should probably give a huge shout out to the guys over at Steve Hill Halent labs.
[01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:23.510]  They guided me through getting my stuff tested.
[01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:26.510]  They gave me a sweet tour of their lab and their facility,
[01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:29.510]  and they got the results to me in like three days.
[01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:32.510]  Big shout out Steve Hill. Hey, I definitely recommend those guys.
[01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:35.510]  If you're unable to get your stuff tested, don't worry. That's not,
[01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:38.510]  it's up to more up to the people that are smoking it than up to the labs.
[01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:41.510]  Like I said, anyway, but either way, once you've got your keeper,
[01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:45.510]  and you've got a clone of it, that should become your new mother plant.
[01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:49.510]  Like if you grew out a seed pack and you and all your friends,
[01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:53.510]  whoever's going to be partaking and participating, smoking, enjoying you,
[01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:56.510]  your girlfriend, your best friend, whoever, you know,
[01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:59.510]  make sure that you guys all kind of agree on the same one. And you keep that one.
[01:39:59.510 --> 01:40:02.510]  It's usually, it's usually a no brainer. That's your new mother.
[01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:05.510]  You're going to have that around forever or until you find something better to grow.
[01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:08.510]  But I would definitely recommend sticking with that strain for a couple of runs
[01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:12.510]  so that you can build a relationship and kind of learn the plant and see some consistency
[01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:16.510]  and see your improvement either way. Now you've got your keeper,
[01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:21.510]  you've got a clone of it. You keep that plant around forever.
[01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:24.510]  So that you always have clones of it. And you've always got that strain to grow.
[01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:28.510]  I keep my mother plants in large pots to keep them from becoming root bound.
[01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:32.510]  I'm going to switch to air pots. They're not cloth pots, they're plastic pots,
[01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:37.510]  but they've got holes in them and they're designed to keep the dirt in while they still have holes in them.
[01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:42.510]  I think that those will be great for my roots. I'll be able to keep a mother plant happier for a little bit longer.
[01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:47.510]  Keep them under at least 18 hours of light. I do 24 hours of light.
[01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:52.510]  My lights never go off in my mother room. My moms are under commercial T5s and they love it.
[01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:57.510]  Make sure you love on those plants often. Love on them once a week.
[01:40:57.510 --> 01:41:00.510]  Go take some cuttings off of them. Keep them the right size. Trim them up.
[01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:03.510]  Give them a lot of airflow. Give them space. Keep them lively.
[01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:08.510]  Take cuttings even if you don't need them. Because that makes your plant keep growing and stay active.
[01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:15.510]  Feed it a nice healthy veg nutrient regimen. Not lots of nitrogen, but enough nitrogen.
[01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:19.510]  You don't want to overfeed the nitrogen. Take good care of them.
[01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:24.510]  Don't let any bugs get to these plants. Treat them with neem oil once a week if you can.
[01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:28.510]  If you're around other gardens or if you're around places where people have bugs,
[01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:34.510]  maybe you need to step up your treatment game. Maybe you need to find a more integrated pest management system,
[01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:38.510]  which we will talk about in more episodes. I've got a friend who's really good at such things.
[01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:41.510]  He'll come and help us out with that in the future.
[01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:45.510]  Alright, so now we understand the mother plants, right? I hope we've got a good understanding.
[01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:52.510]  We put some time into that one. Let's actually take some clones from the mother plant or any plant that's actually in the vegetative state.
[01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:55.510]  You can clone from flowering plants, but I definitely don't recommend it.
[01:41:55.510 --> 01:42:02.510]  The hormones in those plants have changed. You've got to kind of revert the whole plant back to the vegetative state while it roots.
[01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:06.510]  So unless you're experienced and that strain is super amazing, I wouldn't even attempt it.
[01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:09.510]  I would just grow some more seeds or get some more clones.
[01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:16.510]  So I need to grab a drink and I need to take a fat dab and then I will be right back and we will cut some clones together. Hang on.
[01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:22.510]  Alright guys, I am back and it's time to cut some clones.
[01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:27.510]  The first thing I should say is that the most important part of cutting clones is cleanliness. Be clean.
[01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:32.510]  I wear rubber gloves while I cut clones. I also clean all my tools with rubbing alcohol before I get started.
[01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:38.510]  And I try to make sure to have my cloning, my working and my clone room really clean.
[01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:41.510]  Everything I use is clean right before I cut my clones.
[01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:47.510]  So you're also going to need a few items. You'll need a pair of good scissors or a razor blade.
[01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:52.510]  You'll want something that makes a nice clean cut on the first try. You don't want to go sawing off little pieces of your plant here.
[01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:54.510]  You just want to whack it one time and be done.
[01:42:54.510 --> 01:42:57.510]  You need some good rooting hormone or cloning gel.
[01:42:57.510 --> 01:43:03.510]  You're also going to need a cup of water and you should have some pH down to lower the pH of your water.
[01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:07.510]  What comes out of your tap is probably pH around 8 or 7.
[01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:12.510]  For cutting clones we want to get about 6.0 would be ideal.
[01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:18.510]  Alright, so there are two ways of cloning that I want to discuss today.
[01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:21.510]  One is the old rock, wool, cube, tray and dough method.
[01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:24.510]  And the other is the easy cloner style method.
[01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:28.510]  I prefer the easy cloner because they are fast and simple but they're also kind of expensive.
[01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:32.510]  A good easy cloner is going to run you probably $250 to $300.
[01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:36.510]  Plus shipping, plus you have to get a couple of nutrients for it.
[01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:46.510]  So for the cost of that shipping you could probably get the entire set up for the dome and rock, wool, cube and tray style.
[01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:52.510]  Alright, so if you're using the dome and tray method you'll need a cloning tray, a dome to put over your babies.
[01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:56.510]  What the dome does is it traps humidity in and gives your clones a happy environment.
[01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:59.510]  You'll need rock, wool, cubes or something similar to that.
[01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:04.510]  I've used rapid rooters and I've used root riots. They're pretty much all the same thing.
[01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:07.510]  For this type of cloning I use dip and grow for my root hormone.
[01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:10.510]  Basically just dip it in there and it's ready to go.
[01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:16.510]  If you're doing the tray and dome method I also recommend that you use a heat mat and a thermostat to keep the clones warm.
[01:44:16.510 --> 01:44:21.510]  That'll help increase humidity and also increase your survival rate for your new clones.
[01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:28.510]  So if you're doing the easy cloner method all you need is the cloner, some nutrients and your neoprene discs to put the clones into.
[01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:35.510]  For the easy cloner I use Clonex for the gel and I also like to add some stuff called Clear Res.
[01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:43.510]  I'm able to take some pretty big clones fairly quickly and I can usually put them into dirt in 7-10 days using the easy cloner.
[01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:46.510]  So first I'll describe using the easy cloner method.
[01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:49.510]  Make sure your hands are clean and hopefully wear some rubber gloves.
[01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:52.510]  Make sure your scissors are clean. Make sure your mother plant is healthy.
[01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:59.510]  I like to water the plant with plain water the day that I'm going to cut clones from it.
[01:44:59.510 --> 01:45:06.510]  I'll just put plain pH balanced water right through it in the morning and then I'll cut clones that night is usually the way I like to do it.
[01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:14.510]  So then I get my cloner all set up. I've got the easy cloner. I've got it filled with water. It's running. It's got nutrients in it. It's pH'ed at 6.0.
[01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:22.510]  For my easy cloner I use Advanced Nutrients Jungle Juice Grow and Micro for my easy cloner.
[01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:31.510]  I mix my solution in 5 gallon buckets. In each 5 gallon bucket I use 25 ml of Grow and 15 ml of Micro.
[01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:37.510]  Each 5 gallon bucket gets that. I fill each cloner just below the sprayers.
[01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:42.510]  Make sure not to overfill your cloner with water because it will shoot the water all over the place.
[01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:47.510]  Once you've got it filled up then you adjust the pH to 6.0.
[01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:53.510]  Make sure you have the neoprene discs in there before you plug it in and turn it on or the water will go spraying all over the place again.
[01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:57.510]  We need a healthy mother plant and a few healthy shoots to cut off.
[01:45:57.510 --> 01:46:02.510]  The lower branches are easier to clone because they're softer and the fresh roots will grow out of that more easily.
[01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:05.510]  I like to take the tops of my plants for a fat clone.
[01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:10.510]  Find a node that looks healthy and has a nice set of fan leaves at the top.
[01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:13.510]  Something that sticks up and looks like it will become a nice healthy plant on its own.
[01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:19.510]  If you've got a new plant that hasn't ever been cut before, it's already got one fat top sticking off of it.
[01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:26.510]  Follow that down to an intersection to where when you cut it you're going to leave the little tiny flowers or leaves that have grown out of there.
[01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:32.510]  Leave that behind and maybe it will grow into two spots if you cut it right. You'll learn how to do it after a little while.
[01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:35.510]  You've got a spot that looks like it's going to become its own nice happy plant.
[01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:39.510]  Cut that section off. Try to give yourself about a 6 inch section.
[01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:46.510]  I like to clean off most of the extra leaves on the clone. I only keep the top one or two pair of leaves from my clone.
[01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:56.510]  Cut this piece quickly. I keep a cup of water next to me and I drop my cuttings directly into the cup of water to prevent what's called an embolism from developing in the fresh cut.
[01:46:56.510 --> 01:47:05.510]  I've got my scissors in one hand. I'll take a couple of cuts. Snip snip. I've got two fat looking 6 inch cuts with nice leaves at the top.
[01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:11.510]  I just drop those into a cup of water and I gather up cuts. I'll take however many I need.
[01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:19.510]  If I need 10 or 15 I'll just take them all and have them in that cup and then walk to the Easy Cloner so that I'm not cutting clones that sit there and have a chance to dry up.
[01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:29.510]  I take enough cuts and I've got a cup full. I start dipping my cuts one at a time into the clonex.
[01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:39.510]  I like to get a lot of clonex on my cuttings. I pour a small amount onto a plate. I use a plate because it's glass and I feel like none absorbs and I don't waste it.
[01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:45.510]  I pour a small amount onto a plate and I roll the bottom inch, inch and a half of my cutting into the gel and I get it good and covered.
[01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:55.510]  Then I take the neoprene disc out of the cloner. Don't try to shove the clone into the neoprene while it's in the cloner. That's caveman style. You're going to fail. You're going to kill the clone.
[01:47:55.510 --> 01:48:04.510]  Take that little neoprene disc out of the cloner. Open it up like a pacman and put your disc, put your clone in there and set your clone back into the cloner.
[01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:20.510]  You cut it, store it in the cup for a second until you have enough cuttings. You cut it, put it in the cup, get your cup over to your cloning area, dip it, put it inside the neoprene disc and set it right inside your cloner.
[01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:29.510]  Leave it alone. You just cut your first clone. Repeat that until your cloner is full. Dip it and stick it. Dip it and stick it over and over again.
[01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:40.510]  I don't even have to check my cloners for like four or five days after I start them. I just check to make sure that the water isn't splashing out out of any of the inputs or the input or output slots where you plug it in and where the air hose goes and stuff like that.
[01:48:40.510 --> 01:48:48.510]  Just make sure the water hasn't evaporated or gotten too low. You can mostly set it and forget about it until the clones are ready to transplant.
[01:48:48.510 --> 01:49:03.510]  If you're taking clones of multiple strains, make sure you've figured out a way to mark everything and identify which clones you've taken. Sometimes I'll just use a sticky label and put a name on it and stick that in the row or on the front to identify which row those clones are.
[01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:18.510]  Sometimes I use a cup and cut it into strips like the size of a plant label and I write the name on there and stick that in the little pacman slot of the neoprene. You'll know what I mean when you play with the neoprene by the pacman slot right in the mouth.
[01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:27.510]  Just put it in the mouth there and then each clone is labeled. Be sure to label your clones if you're working with more than one strain. There's nothing like having a clone that you're not sure what it is.
[01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:32.510]  You grow it out and you get to wait until day 30 or 40 to figure out what you're working with sometimes.
[01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:42.510]  That should get you guys through the basics of using the Easy Cloner. I feel like I need to take a dab and get a beverage right quick again. I hope you guys join me and take a quick dab.
[01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:48.510]  I'll be back with the lesson on how to use the tray and dome method. Hang in there, I'll be right back.
[01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:53.510]  Yeah, through the magic of editing I am back already.
[01:49:53.510 --> 01:50:01.510]  So the tray and dome method that we were talking about will require a little more attention. You'll have to pay more attention, you'll have to check on it, you'll have to keep the humidity high in there.
[01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:09.510]  You will need to set up your heat mat and a timer or a thermostat. Don't let the clones get too hot. Just about 75 degrees is right.
[01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:21.510]  Aim for 70% humidity. Set the tray on top of your heat mat. I've used everything from Rockwool cubes to Rapid Rooters to every brand of root cubes there are. Most of them work the same.
[01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:30.510]  Get what you like or whatever is available to you. Rockwool is simple and it's inert so that's a good way to start. There are no nutrients in there. I like the ones that don't have nutrients in them.
[01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:42.510]  Take whatever you've selected and soak it in water that's been pH'ed at 6.0. I like to use Rockwool cubes so be sure to soak those things thoroughly. They like to float and they don't absorb the water, they just float sometimes.
[01:50:42.510 --> 01:50:49.510]  So I fill a 5 gallon bucket with water and I drop all my cubes in there and I let them soak. I pull them out one at a time and set them in the tray.
[01:50:50.510 --> 01:51:02.510]  You're going to select your cutting the same way as you did before. You'll take the cuttings the same way. You'll need to cut a nice angle at the tip. Make a nice long angle because that exposed area is where the root tips will start to develop.
[01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:12.510]  So have a cup of cuttings with nice angled cuts on the tips. One at a time dip those into the Dip and Grow. In Dip and Grow you just have to dip it right into there. You don't have to leave it in there.
[01:51:12.510 --> 01:51:24.510]  So just dip it into there and then gently slide your cutting right into that Rockwool cube. Do not go directly into the bottle of Dip and Grow. Pour some of the Dip and Grow out into a shot glass or something similar. You don't want to contaminate that whole bottle.
[01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:33.510]  If one of your plants has a problem and you put it into that Dip and Grow now you just infected the whole bottle. Whatever kind of cloning solution you're going to use that may work.
[01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:50.510]  Be careful not to bend or break your cutting. If you feel it snap you can cut the broken part off if it's still long enough and try to re-dip it and re-stick it. But I would just take another cutting if you have it around. Don't waste space with one you're not certain is going to work.
[01:51:50.510 --> 01:52:07.510]  Try to get your cutting about a half inch or more down into the Rockwool cube if you can. Once you've finished cutting and dipping and sticking the cuttings you can put the dome over the tray. I leave the vents mostly closed. I leave them just a little tiny bit open to let some air flow on the sides if you have side vents but I leave all those top vents closed.
[01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:29.510]  Leave them closed for a day or two and let that humidity build up in there. Put them under a light that's always on and let them take root. T5 lights are perfect for this. LEDs are good also. Be sure to check the humidity and the temp every few hours and make sure the cubes are moist and never dry. If those Rockwool cubes or whatever kind of rooters you're using if those become too dry the clones will die so make sure you pay attention.
[01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:55.510]  In about two weeks hopefully you'll have happy clones that are ready for transplanting. I feel like I've gone over the basics of using the dome and tray method. I honestly haven't done that for quite a while since I've gotten the EZ Cloners. I haven't looked back. That's the only way to go. When I do it right and I pay attention and I keep everything clean I get about a 99 to 100% success rate using my EZ Cloners. They come out with big fat roots and they're nice and healthy and ready to go so that's the way I do it.
[01:52:55.510 --> 01:53:15.510]  If I skipped anything or if I said anything that you felt was off please feel free to email me. I feel like I've given the contact information out quite a few times. Just to be clear it's igrowculture at hotmail.com. You can tweet me at igrowculture. You can find me on Facebook at igrowculture. We are not hard to find.
[01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:29.510]  I was looking for images to post on Instagram and I found a forum post with tons of information and pics. I will post a link to that on the Facebook page and I'll try to tweet it. Between that post and my rant you should have sexy clones in about two weeks.
[01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:49.510]  I think that wraps up my grow lesson for the week. I hope you guys have good looking clones. I hope you have good happy mother plants. In future episodes we're going to talk about the vegetative growth stage. We'll talk about keeping your plants healthy. We'll talk about keeping your plants bug free. We're going to cover a lot of things on this show. I hope you guys stick around for a lot of the stuff that I have planned for you.
[01:53:49.510 --> 01:54:17.510]  Now is the part of the show where we take a moment to give thanks to somebody who I feel has been crucial or beneficial or instrumental to our cannabis movement and or industry. This week we would like to give thanks to a nice lady named Brownie Mary Jane Rathbun. This article comes from papermag.com. They actually wrote an article called 10 Historic Heroes of Marijuana Legalization by Abdullah T. Kidd Saeed. I hope I pronounced that correctly. It's a great article.
[01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:45.510]  We're going to give thanks to Mary Jane Rathbun. It made her buzzword in state medical marijuana efforts as compassion. Seeing the relief that cannabis can bring to severely ill patients makes the laws restricting them seem cruel and unjust. The highly publicized story of Brownie Mary was one of the first to inspire this sentiment. As a hospital volunteer she distributed weed brownies to AIDS patients on the sly. When she got busted for it the public was on her side.
[01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:59.510]  She didn't get mad at a sweet old lady giving brownies to sick people. Brownie Mary Jane spent most of her life dedicated to charity work and was instrumental in the passage of California's Proposition P and Proposition 215.
[01:54:59.510 --> 01:55:27.510]  This lady had huge balls for being an old lady. We give you a huge thanks. We personally appreciate and hugely respect what that lady did, what you did for sick people, for sick people in need, for people in the hospital in their deathbeds trying to survive, trying to be happy. We need more people like you fighting the good fight for us. We give you a huge thanks. Thank you, Mary Jane Rathbun.
[01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:29.210]  I went over time a little bit.
[01:55:29.210 --> 01:55:30.730]  I wanted to be closer to 40 minutes.
[01:55:30.730 --> 01:55:33.790]  I'm already getting close to the 45 minute mark.
[01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:35.290]  Before I go, I wanna remind everybody
[01:55:35.290 --> 01:55:36.810]  to leave some comments.
[01:55:36.810 --> 01:55:38.450]  Now that the show's over, go to iTunes,
[01:55:38.450 --> 01:55:41.010]  go to the iTunes store, search for iGrow Culture,
[01:55:41.010 --> 01:55:44.050]  find the review section, give us a five star rating,
[01:55:44.050 --> 01:55:45.490]  type in a comment, let me know what you think
[01:55:45.490 --> 01:55:48.610]  about the show, and I will read your comments on the show.

[01:55:52.930 --> 01:55:54.450]  I have a hard time with that one.
[01:55:54.450 --> 01:55:55.530]  And you can always find the show
[01:55:55.530 --> 01:55:58.330]  on iRegeneticsColorado.com.

[01:56:14.170 --> 01:56:15.730]  On the next episode, we're gonna talk a little bit
[01:56:15.730 --> 01:56:17.630]  about some change in some Jamaican laws,
[01:56:17.630 --> 01:56:19.710]  and we'll get a little bit more into Grow class,
[01:56:19.710 --> 01:56:21.610]  and we will have Jesse back soon
[01:56:21.610 --> 01:56:23.670]  for more outdoor grow lessons.
[01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:25.510]  Stay tuned, keep listening.
[01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:27.830]  I'll be back in about a week with another show for you.
[01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:31.050]  Till then, take a fat dab, give your mom a hug for me.
[01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:35.070]  It's Bobby Hustle representing
[01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:37.070]  for the real herbalist, Nikkei Tea.
[01:56:37.070 --> 01:56:39.570]  Colorado massive stand up.
[01:56:39.570 --> 01:56:41.830]  It's the hustle, it's the hustle.
[01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:44.110]  Kush roll up.
[01:56:44.110 --> 01:56:46.790]  Colorado said these'll roll up.
[01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:49.710]  Nikkei Tea said kush roll up.
[01:56:49.710 --> 01:56:53.270]  Blend on, if you got it right, I'm out.
[01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:56.270]  Kush roll up in a visa.
[01:56:57.190 --> 01:56:59.790]  Crush it in the end, then we talk to some brothers
[01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:02.630]  how we do so roll up in a visa.
[01:57:02.630 --> 01:57:08.800]  Keep me high day and night, till we learn and I know it's said.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:11.320]  Crush it in the end, then we talk to some brothers
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:20.360]  how we do so roll up in a visa.
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:37.340]  Yeah, yeah, what up ladies and gentlemen?

[01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:47.100]  I'd like to take a second and read the comments
[01:59:47.100 --> 01:59:48.780]  that I actually found on Stitcher.
[01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:50.120]  They're there, they do exist.
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:51.620]  I found it, ta-da.
[01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:54.300]  I don't even know how I stumbled across this, but anyway.
[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:57.060]  Our first comment comes from our friend Mr. Omnio.
[01:59:57.060 --> 02:00:00.080]  Shout out Mr. Omnio, he follows us on Twitter.
[02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:01.620]  Now I find a comment on here.
[02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:03.020]  Thanks for all the support, dude.
[02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:05.660]  He says, educational and amusing.
[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:08.900]  I look forward to this weekly podcast
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:11.780]  as it's both informative, and then in parentheses,
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:14.020]  he says, even for the seasoned pros.
[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:16.420]  He says, it's informative, educational, and I enjoy
[02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:18.180]  its relaxed, easygoing style,
[02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:20.820]  whether presenter only or with guests.
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:24.660]  I can pretty much be sure of a laugh along at some point,
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:28.780]  too, as there's often a laugh or two moments included.
[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:30.140]  Well, thanks, dude, I'm glad you appreciate that.
[02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:31.100]  That's kind of what I try to do.
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:32.060]  I'm a goofy dude.
[02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:33.860]  If you know me personally, anybody that knows me,
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:35.260]  you know I'm a goofy son of a bitch.
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:38.500]  So I try to keep myself together and keep it composed
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:40.940]  while I do the podcast, but sometimes we just gotta bust out
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:43.580]  on the show, so thanks for having fun with me.
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:44.980]  Thanks for learning with me.
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:46.020]  Are you a seasoned pro, dude?
[02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:47.300]  I'd like to know more about you.
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:49.140]  Tell me what your grow level is.
[02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:51.460]  Are you a white belt grower, are you a black belt?
[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:53.700]  Send me a tweet, we'll read more of your stuff.
[02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:55.060]  Thanks a lot for the support.
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:57.700]  The next comment comes from Henry710.
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:59.940]  He says, exactly what I'm looking for.
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:01.820]  This podcast answers the questions
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:03.380]  I've been too afraid to ask.
[02:01:03.380 --> 02:01:06.820]  Colorado is lucky to have these guys.
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:07.660]  Well, thanks a lot, man.
[02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:09.100]  That means a lot to me.
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:10.740]  That's what I'm here for, is to answer the questions
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:12.900]  that people in other places can't ask.
[02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:15.700]  A lot of us are growing, we're hiding still.
[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:17.220]  There are only a few states that are,
[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:18.700]  almost half the states are legal now,
[02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:20.940]  but that means there's half that you can't have weed,
[02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:23.500]  you can't grow weed, so you gotta be on the undercover
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:25.180]  so you can listen to this podcast
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:26.740]  while you're working in your garden,
[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:29.540]  while you're driving to work, while you're doing whatever,
[02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:30.460]  and you can learn some shit.
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:32.100]  So I'm glad I'm helping you guys out.
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:35.060]  And Colorado is lucky to have us, I guess.
[02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:36.260]  I just feel like it's my duty.
[02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:37.780]  I guess the world is lucky to have me
[02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:39.100]  feeling like I need to do this,
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:42.500]  but I feel really blessed and really lucky.
[02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:44.100]  Blessed is the word, there's no luck involved.
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:46.820]  I'm blessed, I worked hard and I was given
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:49.140]  what I worked for to be this educated
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:50.420]  and this good with the plant.
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:52.140]  So I feel like I gotta return it to you,
[02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:54.180]  because I love it, I just love it.
[02:01:54.180 --> 02:01:55.420]  So I gotta give that love back.
[02:01:55.420 --> 02:01:58.100]  So I send it out to you guys with the show, my return.
[02:01:58.100 --> 02:01:58.940]  It's my karma.
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:03.380]  The next comment is from our friend, Overgrowthegov.
[02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:04.220]  What's up, bro?
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:05.060]  I know who you are.
[02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:07.220]  He says, the info show, dude,
[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:09.180]  you rocked it with the info on this one, Jeff.
[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:10.220]  Great show.
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:11.180]  I know who you are, bro.
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:12.020]  Thanks a lot, man.

[02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:14.260]  I appreciate the support.

[02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:18.500]  went and put some flyers out.
[02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:19.900]  I appreciate the help and the support, bro.
[02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:22.660]  So big shout out to Overgrowthegov.
[02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:24.980]  Man, I appreciate the comments you guys left.
[02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:26.340]  It's good to know people are listening
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:28.260]  and appreciating the show and learning something.
[02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:29.580]  I put a little bit of work into this
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:31.980]  and it all pays off reading those kinds of comments.
[02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:33.460]  I truly do appreciate that.

[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:00.840]  Coming up in this episode,
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.240]  we're gonna talk about putting those clones
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:04.680]  we cut last week into some dirt,
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:06.200]  but first we're gonna read some news.
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:07.640]  Let me take a dab real quick
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:10.560]  and we will be right back with a few cool news reports.
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:11.400]  Hang tight.
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:15.960]  All right, before we get into the news,
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:18.320]  I wanna do our first product review on the show.
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:20.560]  Our good friends at Mary Jane's Glass Haberdasher
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:23.280]  in Pueblo, Colorado were kind enough to give me
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:27.440]  the CloudPore CloudTank M2 to review on the show.
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:28.760]  It's a handy little dab pin.
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:30.520]  I've been smoking some Lemon Jeffrey out of it
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:32.440]  for about a week and a half now.
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:33.760]  It hasn't burned out on me yet,
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:37.280]  which is actually pretty impressive for most dab pins.
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:39.700]  They gave me the Viking battery to attach to it.
[02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:43.200]  They said any battery of this voltage will work.
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:46.520]  The next part is actually the CloudPore tank.
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:49.120]  It fits into the, it's actually the CloudPore body.
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:50.240]  It fits right into the battery.
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:51.820]  It just screws in.
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:53.960]  The next part is the heating element.
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:54.920]  So if that part dies,
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:57.920]  you can just unscrew the heating element and replace it.
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:01.160]  The next part is the tank where your extracts,
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.280]  your concentrates will go in.
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:03.680]  I've got Lemon Jeffrey in here now.
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:06.320]  It tastes delicious out of this thing.
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:09.280]  So you put your concentrate in, you screw on the cap,
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:11.880]  and then it's got this, it's like a dome,
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:13.160]  but it's just a straight cylinder.
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:15.460]  So it's got a cylinder dome that fits on top of that piece
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:17.900]  over the tank, and then it's got a mouthpiece.
[02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:19.420]  Now, what I really do like is they claim
[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:21.260]  that this is all titanium,
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:23.100]  and that the heating element is ceramic,
[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:23.920]  which is really cool,
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:27.020]  because what I don't like about a lot of these dab pins
[02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:28.700]  is the plasticky taste that they get.
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:31.340]  And I'm sure, because they do have that feature
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:33.540]  where if you hit the button for 15 seconds or 10 seconds,
[02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:34.740]  whatever, it turns off, right?
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:36.540]  But we've learned that trick.
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:38.500]  So you just hold it down for one second less,
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:40.040]  let it go, and then start over again
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:41.660]  so that you can keep heating that bitch, right?
[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:44.420]  But I've tasted those dab pins melting
[02:04:44.420 --> 02:04:45.300]  while I'm dabbing them,
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:46.940]  or while my buddy dabbed it too long,
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:49.140]  or whichever one of us overheated it.
[02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:50.220]  I could taste the plastic.
[02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:51.860]  This one, I've been heating the shit out of it,
[02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:53.980]  and I haven't tasted any plastic yet.
[02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:55.280]  It did get clogged up one time,
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:57.660]  but it was really easy for me to get it clean.
[02:04:57.660 --> 02:05:00.500]  I've had two other vape pins that I've clogged up,
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.800]  and once they got clogged, they were done.
[02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:04.700]  It does have a dry herb attachment available,
[02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:05.980]  but I did not ask for that.
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:07.860]  I told her I wouldn't use it.
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:09.620]  I don't like to smoke herb out of a little pen.
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:11.660]  That seems, I don't know, it's silly to me.
[02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:12.540]  I would have to smoke,
[02:05:12.540 --> 02:05:14.180]  I'd have to fill that thing 25 times
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:16.140]  to get the effect I need.
[02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:19.500]  But I'm gonna go and give it four stars,
[02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:21.180]  or four leaves out of five,
[02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:23.200]  because it's a reliable product.
[02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:25.020]  It's lasted me two weeks now.
[02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:27.100]  It stays charged and charges quickly.
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:29.860]  It holds enough extract for me to do what I need to do.
[02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:33.720]  I haven't broken it yet.
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:35.360]  It doesn't taste bad.
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:37.860]  The only thing is it could hit a little harder.
[02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:40.780]  I feel like if they made these little holes larger,
[02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:42.500]  or if they gave me a little bit more heat,
[02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:44.180]  I'd get more of a dab.
[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:46.240]  It takes, you get a certain amount of time of heat
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:48.020]  on this thing, and then it cuts off.
[02:05:48.020 --> 02:05:49.460]  And I feel like if I preheat it,
[02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:51.020]  and if I hold it down for half of the time,
[02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:52.500]  like I'm holding it now,
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:53.320]  and then I let go,
[02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:55.220]  and then I actually go back and hit it,
[02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:00.620]  that's a way to get a fat hit out of it.
[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:02.860]  But I've learned it, I like it.
[02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:05.380]  So I'm gonna give it four pot leaves out of five.
[02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:07.380]  And I wanna give a shout out again to our friends,
[02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:09.060]  Mary Jane's Glass Haberdasher.
[02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:09.900]  What's up guys?
[02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:10.740]  Thanks for helping us out.
[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:12.220]  Thanks for hooking us up with this device.
[02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:13.780]  I've been loving it when I'm in a place
[02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:16.140]  where I can't take a dab, and I'd really like to.
[02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:16.980]  But check them out.
[02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:18.420]  They've got two locations in Pueblo.
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:21.220]  They are on 1626 Highway 50,
[02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:25.220]  and they are also on 1019 South Pueblo Boulevard.
[02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:27.220]  That was our first product review.
[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:29.260]  It's hard to say when you're dabbed out.
[02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:30.980]  We'll be right back with the news.
[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:31.820]  Here we go.
[02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:41.180]  All right, it's time for the iGrow Culture News.
[02:06:41.180 --> 02:06:43.180]  This time we've actually got some good news to report.
[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:45.740]  There's been plenty of bad shit going on in the world.
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:47.260]  But for the world news,
[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:52.260]  Jamaica to decriminalize personal marijuana possession.
[02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:53.340]  Big up to Jamaica.
[02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:55.620]  This article is actually by Horace Helps
[02:06:56.540 --> 02:06:57.860]  from the Chicago Tribune.
[02:06:57.860 --> 02:06:59.500]  That's a cool name, Horace Helps.
[02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:03.540]  The Jamaican government has decided to decriminalize
[02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:05.820]  the possession of small amounts of marijuana,
[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:08.380]  joining the trickle of countries moving to soften laws
[02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:11.980]  on the drug known on the Caribbean island as ganja.
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:16.100]  Minister of Justice, Mark Golding,
[02:07:16.100 --> 02:07:18.180]  made the announcement at the afternoon news conference
[02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:21.580]  on Thursday saying that Jamaica's dangerous drug acts
[02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:25.420]  would formally be amended this summer.
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:31.260]  So it looks like Jamaica's gonna let you have some ganja.
[02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:32.500]  Read more.
[02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:35.180]  The cabinet of Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller,
[02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:36.620]  is that Portia or Portia?
[02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:39.860]  Somebody tweet me and tell me, at iGrow Culture.
[02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:42.900]  The cabinet of Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller
[02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:44.300]  made the decision on June 2nd.
[02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:46.460]  He said, cabinet approved certain changes
[02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:48.740]  to the law relating to ganja.
[02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:51.140]  These relate to possession of small quantities of ganja
[02:07:51.140 --> 02:07:54.180]  for personal use, the smoking of ganja in private places
[02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:57.020]  and the use of ganja for medical medicinal purposes.
[02:07:57.020 --> 02:08:00.100]  He said, approval has been given also to a proposal
[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:02.220]  for the decriminalization of the use of ganja
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:03.260]  for religious purposes.
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:06.140]  He said, so they're doing their laws even better
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:08.580]  than Colorado did because in Jamaica,
[02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:11.300]  you don't have to get cancer or get in a car wreck
[02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:13.700]  or claim that something hurts or walk funny.
[02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:16.300]  You can just go in and say that it's for religious purposes.
[02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:19.500]  You can just grow some dreadlocks and get your weed.
[02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:21.420]  Oh, Jamaica.
[02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:22.260]  All right.
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:23.900]  Uruguay recently became the latest country
[02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:25.220]  to legalize marijuana use,
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:26.580]  joining several countries in Europe
[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:29.140]  as well as the United States of...
[02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:30.020]  Oh, okay.
[02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:31.780]  They just worded this one funny.
[02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.780]  The US states of Colorado and Washington.
[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:36.340]  I thought they were gonna call Colorado and Washington
[02:08:36.380 --> 02:08:39.460]  our own states, but they just worded that oddly.
[02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:41.140]  So possession of small quantities of the drug
[02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:43.340]  would become a non-arrestable ticketable infraction
[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:46.060]  in Jamaica resulting in a fine, Golding said.
[02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:48.740]  And here's why they did it, which I think is kind of great.
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:51.060]  They say, too many of our young people have ended up
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:53.820]  with criminal convictions after being caught with a spliff,
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:56.380]  something that has affected their ability to do things
[02:08:56.380 --> 02:08:59.020]  like get jobs and get visas to travel overseas,
[02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:00.300]  Golding said.
[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:02.540]  He added that the government would propose a bill
[02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:03.860]  in the Jamaican parliament soon
[02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:05.420]  that will expunge the criminal records
[02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:06.940]  of people convicted for possession
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:08.700]  of small amounts of the drug,
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:11.460]  which has grown widely across Jamaica.
[02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:14.780]  The change means that a person cannot be arrested
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:18.780]  if he has in his possession up to 57 grams
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:21.580]  of ganja in public space.
[02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:25.180]  Anyone ticketed will be given 30 days to pay the fine,
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:28.100]  failure of which will result in becoming a minor offense,
[02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:29.700]  resulting in the offender doing
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:32.100]  court-ordered community service.
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:33.860]  According to Golding, possession of ganja
[02:09:33.860 --> 02:09:35.660]  for religious or therapeutic purposes
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:38.320]  as prescribed by a registered medical practitioner
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:41.720]  or for scientific research by an accredited institution
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:44.780]  will also be decriminalized.
[02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:48.620]  So big up to Jamaica, shout out, much love, much respect.
[02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:50.340]  They're doing the right thing, it looks like.
[02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:52.300]  There's nothing in there that I wanted to argue with.
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:55.780]  They're gonna let you have medicinal marijuana.
[02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:57.740]  They're gonna let you have religious marijuana,
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:09:59.260]  which is damn cool.
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:04.020]  Non-arrestable ticketable offense, infraction,
[02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:06.140]  not even an offense, an infraction in Jamaica.
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:08.100]  So you just get a ticket now
[02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:09.740]  and they're doing it for the right reasons.
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:11.860]  They don't wanna, they keep fucking up the youth
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:13.740]  for small things like cannabis
[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:17.180]  and then they can't get jobs and they're screwed forever.
[02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:18.460]  This is gonna help out a lot of people.
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:20.800]  So this is a really cool thing.
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:22.900]  Big up to Jamaica, we are making progress.
[02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:26.260]  We're gonna legalize the world before too long here.
[02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:27.700]  Let's get back to the United States.
[02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:29.060]  Welcome to New York,
[02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:32.020]  the 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana.
[02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:33.020]  I already know some of you guys
[02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:35.460]  are gonna have some things to say about this one.
[02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:38.100]  This one is by Josefa Velasquez
[02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:40.900]  from the Associated Press, I founded on the cannabis.
[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:44.460]  New York is set to become the 23rd state
[02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:45.980]  to legalize medical marijuana
[02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:48.820]  under an agreement announced by legislative leaders.
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:51.100]  The Democratic-led assembly passed the legislation
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:55.740]  113 to 13 early Friday after an hour of debate.
[02:10:55.740 --> 02:10:57.860]  Shortly after midnight, Senate majority leader,
[02:10:57.860 --> 02:11:00.300]  Dean Skelos, I don't know if that's how you say that,
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:02.660]  but it looks cool, said the bill would be voted on
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:04.460]  later in the day when Republican lawmakers
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:06.180]  had reviewed the legislation.
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:08.860]  Skelos of Long Island said he had planned
[02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:11.680]  to vote for the measure and believed there were enough votes
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:14.460]  to pass the bill in the upper chamber.
[02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:16.460]  Anyway, the so-called Compassionate Care Act
[02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:18.700]  would legalize certain forms of marijuana
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:21.260]  for severely ill patients.
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:23.540]  Legislation does not allow the drug to be sold
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:24.980]  in the plant form or smoked,
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:29.980]  but it can be administered through a vapor or an oil base.
[02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:33.500]  Wait, did you guys catch that?
[02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:34.660]  Because I read this previously
[02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:36.760]  and I knew what I was getting myself into.
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:40.440]  Cannot be sold in plant form or smoked,
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:43.220]  but it can be administered through a vaporizer
[02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:45.540]  or an oil base.
[02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:47.980]  That's not medical marijuana, you just fucked yourselves.
[02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:49.620]  Don't pass this.
[02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:51.500]  What are you doing, New York?
[02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:52.620]  All right, I'm gonna keep reading.
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:53.980]  Earlier in the negotiations,
[02:11:53.980 --> 02:11:56.540]  Governor Andrew Cuomo sought to ban smoking the drug,
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:59.620]  saying it was wrong for the state to promote smoking.
[02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:01.100]  In the end, you have to balance the needs
[02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:03.180]  of many of the patients, and the truth is,
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:04.060]  we're coming to a point
[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:06.180]  where less and less people smoke anyway,
[02:12:06.180 --> 02:12:09.340]  said bill sponsor Senator Diane Savino,
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:11.420]  a Staten Island Democrat, on Thursday.
[02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:13.840]  Marijuana could be scribed for at least 10 diseases,
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:16.980]  including epilepsy, AIDS, ALS, and neuropathy,
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:19.100]  under the direction of the state's health department.
[02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:22.420]  The health commissioner would be able to add more illnesses.
[02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:24.260]  If approved by the legislature,
[02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:26.300]  the bill would allow the program to start
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:29.260]  as soon as 18 months, in as soon as 18 months,
[02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:31.260]  and would allow a governor to terminate it
[02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:34.340]  under advice from the health department or law enforcement.
[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:36.300]  Well, what the fuck is that?
[02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:38.920]  If it's approved, it could start in 18 months,
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:42.460]  but if a governor or the health department
[02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:46.180]  or law enforcement decide that they wanna shut it down,
[02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:47.020]  they can.
[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:49.700]  So you guys are fucking up over there in New York.
[02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:52.180]  Medical marijuana has the capacity to do a lot of good
[02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:53.860]  for a lot of people who are in pain,
[02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:56.340]  who are suffering, and are in desperate need of treatment
[02:12:56.340 --> 02:12:57.620]  that can provide relief,
[02:12:57.620 --> 02:13:00.180]  Cuomo said during a news conference with lawmakers.
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:02.260]  Sounds like somebody wrote that shit out
[02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:04.140]  for her really well.
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:05.660]  Doctors would have to undergo training
[02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:07.280]  to be eligible to prescribe the drug
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:09.420]  and could face a felony charge punishable
[02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:10.780]  by up to four years of prison
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:12.820]  if they write fraudulent prescriptions.
[02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:14.220]  God damn.
[02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:16.020]  The bill does not require insurance companies
[02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:18.140]  to cover the cost of the drug, of course not.
[02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:19.780]  Patients who sell their prescribed marijuana
[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:22.220]  could face a misdemeanor charge.
[02:13:22.220 --> 02:13:24.660]  Patients will be required to carry a registration card
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:27.260]  showing they're authorized to possess the drug
[02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:30.940]  and can be prescribed a maximum 30 day supply.
[02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:33.380]  So who's gonna decide what a 30 day supply is?
[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:35.540]  New York, you've done fucked up, dude.
[02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:36.500]  This is not right.
[02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:39.220]  The more I read this, stupider you sound.
[02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:41.940]  Five registered growing organizations will be allowed
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:44.220]  up to four dispensaries each throughout the state.
[02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:48.100]  Wait, five organizations get four shops each.
[02:13:48.100 --> 02:13:50.580]  Isn't that like monopolizing already?
[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:54.420]  With the counties where the marijuana is grown and sold
[02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:56.780]  receiving revenue from an excise tax.
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:59.260]  Under the stipulation, cultivators must grow the drug
[02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:01.940]  indoors in a secure facility.
[02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:04.140]  Cuomo was initially opposed to medical marijuana
[02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:06.140]  earlier in his term,
[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:08.420]  but proposed a pilot program in January
[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:10.340]  to allow up to 20 hospitals statewide
[02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:11.820]  to administer the drug.
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:14.020]  Initially wanted a five year sunset period
[02:14:14.020 --> 02:14:15.540]  to evaluate the new program,
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:18.860]  but negotiations extended that to seven.
[02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:22.780]  So Jamaica got it right.
[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:24.940]  New York fucked it all up.
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:26.420]  What are you doing, dude?
[02:14:26.420 --> 02:14:31.420]  That's really, that is stupid medical marijuana in New York.
[02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:34.640]  I'm not even gonna count them as the new state
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:35.540]  for medical marijuana.
[02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:37.880]  They're the new poser state.
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:41.260]  They're like, if you didn't see six or seven red flags
[02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:44.660]  in that whole article, you're not paying attention.
[02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:46.940]  All right, let's get back to more local news.
[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:48.140]  We've gone worldwide.
[02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:48.980]  We did national.
[02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:52.640]  Now let's get back to the hometown of Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:54.700]  This article is from the Pueblo Chief
[02:14:54.700 --> 02:14:55.940]  and I'm looking for an author.
[02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:58.220]  It is written by Chris Woodka.
[02:14:58.220 --> 02:15:01.820]  It is titled, Bored Eyes Water for Marijuana.
[02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:06.060]  Two policies to provide water for growing marijuana
[02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:07.920]  within city limits and in Pueblo County
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:11.000]  will be considered today by the Pueblo Board of Water Works.
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.500]  The water board meets at 2 p.m.
[02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:14.900]  at the Allen C. Hamel Administration Building,
[02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:17.600]  319 West 4th Street.
[02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:20.460]  Two resolutions have been drafted
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:22.220]  for consideration by the board.
[02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:24.820]  One for supplying treated water within Pueblo city limits
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:28.340]  and the other to leasing raw water within Pueblo County.
[02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:30.380]  Both types of water sales would be subject
[02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:32.540]  to changes in federal law.
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:34.140]  The resolutions are an attempt to work
[02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:36.800]  with the Bureau of Reclamation's temporary policy,
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:38.620]  which prohibits using federal facilities
[02:15:38.620 --> 02:15:41.860]  such as Lake Pueblo to provide water to grow marijuana.
[02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:44.380]  It excludes water not under federal contract
[02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:46.380]  that is commingled with contract water.
[02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:51.140]  The policy issued in May also requires reclamation
[02:15:51.140 --> 02:15:52.900]  to notify the Department of Justice
[02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:55.460]  if its employees learn water from a federal facility
[02:15:55.460 --> 02:15:57.700]  is being used to grow marijuana.
[02:15:57.700 --> 02:16:00.460]  We talked about this in a previous episode.
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:01.980]  Although medical marijuana was approved
[02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:03.580]  by Colorado voters in 2000
[02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:06.420]  and recreational marijuana passed in 2012,
[02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:09.580]  growing marijuana remains a federal crime.
[02:16:09.580 --> 02:16:11.100]  Under the proposed resolutions,
[02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:14.180]  the Pueblo Water Board would not sell any water
[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:16.180]  with the federal link in the supply chain
[02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:17.500]  to marijuana growers,
[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:20.860]  but it would sell water from its direct flow rights
[02:16:20.860 --> 02:16:23.240]  below Pueblo Dam to the pot industry.
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:26.340]  The resolution to the city use water
[02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:27.940]  would revise the water board's policy
[02:16:27.940 --> 02:16:30.580]  to change the use of water based on federal policy.
[02:16:32.580 --> 02:16:34.900]  It also clarifies that sentence is what that says.
[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:35.940]  It didn't make sense when I read it,
[02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:38.080]  but I stopped and read it again and it made sense.
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:39.680]  The resolution to use city water
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:41.080]  would revise the board's policy
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:43.780]  to change the use of water based on federal policy.
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:46.040]  They just like to write a bunch of bullshit
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:47.840]  to make it sound like they're writing stuff.
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:49.780]  It also clarifies that some of the water rights
[02:16:49.780 --> 02:16:52.640]  owned by the water board are not subject to federal policy.
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:54.900]  However, the policy leaves open the possibility
[02:16:54.900 --> 02:16:57.200]  of terminating water use for marijuana
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:58.760]  if federal policy changes.
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:01.320]  It's all about policy, check your policy.
[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:02.480]  Under the second resolution,
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:05.680]  the water board would make up to 800 acre feet,
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:08.840]  260 million gallons of raw water available
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:11.600]  to marijuana growers in Pueblo County annually
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:13.840]  through leases that potentially could provide
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:16.920]  up to $500,000 in revenue each year
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:20.640]  using the current rate of $630 per acre foot.
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:22.840]  It also contains a provision to cancel contracts
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:24.840]  based on federal policy changes
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:26.460]  and stipulates that the water board
[02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:30.040]  is not required to negotiate or approve any water lease.
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:32.560]  The city of Pueblo has regulations for medical marijuana
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:34.300]  and for growing, manufacturing
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:36.520]  and testing recreational marijuana.
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:39.740]  Pueblo County has regulations that allow medical marijuana
[02:17:39.740 --> 02:17:44.380]  as well as growing and selling recreational marijuana.
[02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:46.780]  So there's one part here that got my attention.
[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:52.420]  It also contains a provision to cancel contracts
[02:17:52.420 --> 02:17:56.420]  based on federal policy changes and stipulates,
[02:17:56.420 --> 02:17:57.660]  here's the fucked up part,
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:18:00.260]  that the water board is not required to negotiate
[02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:02.340]  or approve any water lease.
[02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:06.580]  So if one day they decide water is now $900 per acre foot,
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:07.580]  guess what?
[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:09.300]  They are not required to negotiate
[02:18:09.300 --> 02:18:10.880]  or approve any water lease.
[02:18:12.180 --> 02:18:14.540]  You guys wonder, people often complain
[02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:15.700]  that marijuana is too expensive,
[02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:17.220]  that high-grade cannabis is too expensive,
[02:18:17.220 --> 02:18:18.620]  that the shops are charging too much.
[02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:20.820]  This is the reason why, shit like this.
[02:18:21.940 --> 02:18:25.340]  Every time, and I'm experienced in this,
[02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:27.140]  I've seen this, I was a part of this.
[02:18:27.140 --> 02:18:29.940]  Every time a dispensary, I was part of the Wild Wild West.
[02:18:30.420 --> 02:18:33.380]  I was a big part of the very first dispensary
[02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:35.460]  in city limits in Pueblo.
[02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:38.460]  There were no dispensaries in the city limits of this town
[02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:40.660]  when I had a shop with some friends.
[02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:42.940]  They had a shop started, I helped them get it going.
[02:18:42.940 --> 02:18:46.100]  One day they got tired of it, handed me the keys.
[02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:48.660]  Then one day the police came in and closed us down.
[02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:51.700]  But every time we would get our shit together,
[02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:52.980]  they'd say, here's your next hurdle.
[02:18:52.980 --> 02:18:54.580]  We would jump through that hurdle.
[02:18:54.580 --> 02:18:56.580]  And then they'd go, oh, these guys can jump high.
[02:18:56.580 --> 02:18:58.300]  Let's give them a really high hurdle.
[02:18:58.300 --> 02:18:59.740]  So they put us up another hurdle.
[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:01.780]  Eventually we're playing high jump.
[02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:03.460]  And once we got good at high jump,
[02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:05.100]  then they wanted to do more shit.
[02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:07.580]  They wanted us to javelin, you know what I'm saying?
[02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:08.740]  I've seen it happen.
[02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:11.620]  The dispensaries went from a few rules to ridiculous rules,
[02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:13.340]  to everything being under camera,
[02:19:13.340 --> 02:19:14.660]  everything being on lockdown.
[02:19:14.660 --> 02:19:16.620]  And every one of those steps costs more money
[02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:18.020]  and more money and more money.
[02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:19.780]  And I think that's a lot of what they're doing it for,
[02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:21.660]  is for more money.
[02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:24.740]  But that's the stuff that's making the price of cannabis
[02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:26.820]  stay where it is instead of going down
[02:19:26.820 --> 02:19:28.860]  with the mass supply that we have provided.
[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:32.500]  We have to come up with more money for water now.
[02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:34.500]  We didn't think about that.
[02:19:34.500 --> 02:19:36.340]  All right, that's another rant that I just went off on.
[02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:37.180]  Glad you guys were a part of it.
[02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:39.660]  I feel like that was enough news for the day.
[02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:42.420]  You guys want to get into a grow lesson right quick?
[02:19:42.420 --> 02:19:44.460]  In the last episode, we took a bunch of clones.
[02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:45.380]  They're probably rooted.
[02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:47.300]  So we better learn how to get them into dirt.
[02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:48.500]  I'm going to take a couple of dabs.
[02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:50.500]  You guys hang out and I'll be right back.
[02:19:50.500 --> 02:20:01.640]  All right, in the last episode,
[02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:05.040]  we talked about mother plants and cutting clones.
[02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:07.600]  Those clones should be rooted and ready to go into dirt now
[02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:09.300]  or within the next few days.
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:11.920]  Potting clones from the Easy Cloner
[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:14.840]  and the Rockwool cubes will be pretty much the same.
[02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:16.920]  You'll need to be a little bit more careful
[02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:18.040]  with the clones from the Easy Cloner
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:20.560]  because they don't have anything holding the roots in place.
[02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:21.620]  So just be a little more careful.
[02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:23.080]  They're kind of more delicate.
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:25.200]  Before I go too far,
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:27.360]  I should mention something noted to me by my buddy,
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:28.520]  Cut Proof.
[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.000]  Cut Proof does not use mother plants.
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.320]  Cut Proof uses his vegging plants as his mother plants
[02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:36.440]  and takes cuttings off of them two or three weeks
[02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:39.300]  before he flowers his big plants.
[02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:41.660]  So that saves him some space.
[02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:43.900]  If you're only growing a few strains, that's a great idea.
[02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:46.520]  Subcool uses that strategy.
[02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:49.120]  I'm kind of thinking about switching to it myself
[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:50.480]  to make more room available.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:53.360]  So instead of having a mother plant
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:54.400]  that you take cuttings from
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:55.480]  and then you grow those cuttings,
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:57.140]  you just have this plant that's been in veg
[02:20:57.140 --> 02:20:58.960]  for a few weeks now
[02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:00.680]  and you just take two or three,
[02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:01.960]  three or four cuttings off of it.
[02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:03.760]  Now you've got your new mother plant
[02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:05.600]  and then you've also got your next round of plants
[02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:07.000]  to veg from there.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.560]  So as long as you're confident in your clone cutting,
[02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:12.060]  wait a couple of weeks for those clones to root or whatever
[02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:14.040]  and then throw that plant into the flower room
[02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:15.880]  and then you've got your next mother.
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:17.100]  As long as you take healthy cuts,
[02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:19.760]  I don't think there is any genetic loss.
[02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:20.820]  They call it genetic drift.
[02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:24.480]  I don't think it happens if you are proper with your plants.
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:26.280]  We could probably talk a whole nother episode
[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:27.120]  about that one.
[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:29.480]  So back to getting our clones into dirt.
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:32.120]  Make sure your area is clean and try to wear rubber gloves.
[02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:32.960]  That's really important
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:34.600]  because you're gonna have the roots out.
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:35.920]  The roots are the most gentle part.
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:37.360]  Anything they touch, they will absorb.
[02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:38.200]  Keep that in mind.
[02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:41.000]  Don't go setting them on some dirty shit.
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.660]  It's important to use good soil for your plants.
[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:45.320]  I like Happy Frog or Light Warrior for my babies.
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:47.400]  Something that allows a lot of oxygen
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:49.600]  into the root zone is ideal.
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:51.280]  I like to use a small amount of nutrients
[02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:52.880]  when I put these babies into dirt.
[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:55.320]  I make sure to add some kind of root inoculant.
[02:21:55.320 --> 02:21:58.120]  You want something with lots of mycorrhiza.
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:00.880]  I use Great White or OGT.
[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:02.600]  You can get OGT at Hygro Pueblo.
[02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:04.880]  We talked about them earlier.
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:08.200]  Mycos are beneficial fungi that promote root growth.
[02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:09.960]  You'll definitely notice a difference
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:11.880]  in your plant's performance if you use them.
[02:22:11.880 --> 02:22:13.720]  If you use them in one plant and don't use them in another,
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:16.200]  you'll be able to tell by the root acceleration.
[02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:18.040]  Once the roots get bigger,
[02:22:18.040 --> 02:22:20.000]  they can take more nutrients.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.120]  Just makes your plants grow bigger, better,
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:24.120]  happier, faster, healthier.
[02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:27.960]  I definitely recommend using some mycos in your mix.
[02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:30.560]  I also use a small dose of veg nutrients
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:32.680]  for my transplants right now.
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:35.280]  I mix up a five gallon bucket of water
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:38.400]  with my Great White and my veg nutrients that I'm using.
[02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:40.840]  For small plants, I do use bottled nutrients.
[02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:43.040]  I like organic hair for my babies.
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:44.640]  I'll mix up some Nitrex and Great White
[02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:48.080]  and then just adjust it to 6-5 with my pH.
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:49.600]  I toss an airstone in the bucket
[02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:51.880]  and I let that water get oxygenated
[02:22:51.880 --> 02:22:55.480]  while I start getting my containers ready.
[02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:58.120]  So for these small plants, they're just little babies,
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:01.000]  we're gonna use solo cups, like a beer cup.
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:01.960]  Don't use clear cups.
[02:23:01.960 --> 02:23:03.720]  You don't want your roots exposed to light.
[02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:06.640]  I take a solo cup and I cut plenty of drainage holes
[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:08.520]  at the bottom to let excess water escape.
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:09.840]  You want water to drip right out,
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:12.880]  but you need the bottom of the cup to stay intact.
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:14.200]  So once my cups are prepared,
[02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:16.200]  I fill them about halfway with soil.
[02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:17.640]  I put them in a tray and water each cup
[02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:21.280]  with my nutrient solution before I put the clone into it.
[02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:24.000]  So you basically just wanna water the dirt.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.680]  The main difference between the Rockwool Cubes
[02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:27.240]  and the Easy Cloners is that the Easy Cloner
[02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:28.520]  is a little more vulnerable
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:31.240]  and needs a little more help for this next step.
[02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:33.760]  So with the Easy Cloner clones,
[02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:35.160]  I make a little mound in my cup.
[02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:37.800]  It should kinda look like a traffic cone.
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:39.480]  So I should remind you to wear rubber gloves
[02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:40.960]  for this whole process, by the way.
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:41.920]  So I have a little mound of dirt,
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:44.200]  like a traffic cone, inside my cup.
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:46.160]  I try to spread the roots apart
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:48.480]  around that mound kinda evenly.
[02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:50.920]  And then that really promotes root growth
[02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:52.400]  and balance plants.
[02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:53.720]  So once the roots are carefully spread out
[02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:55.000]  and the clone is centered,
[02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:57.400]  add more soil into the cup
[02:23:57.400 --> 02:24:00.840]  until you have about a half inch space on top left.
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:02.200]  And then water the clone thoroughly
[02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:03.920]  with the nutrient solution
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:05.960]  and put it under a T5 light
[02:24:05.960 --> 02:24:08.680]  that stays on for a minimum of 18 hours per day.
[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:13.280]  I keep my T5 lights very close to my plants.
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:15.480]  I get them as close to the tops as I can get
[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:17.920]  without exceeding about 77 degrees.
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:20.040]  Definitely don't get above 80 or 85 in there.
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:21.200]  You'll be in trouble.
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:23.960]  80's kinda high, 85, you're in trouble.
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:25.920]  For the clones in rockwool, the rapid rooters,
[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:26.760]  I do the same thing,
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:29.160]  but I'm not as concerned about spreading the roots out
[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:31.400]  because the rapid rooter, the rockwool,
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:32.760]  has them spread out enough already
[02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:34.480]  and it's kinda holding them intact
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:35.560]  to the base of the clone,
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:37.080]  which is where they're real tender.
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:39.600]  So just set that rockwool into the wet soil
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:40.920]  and fill the cup until there's about
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:42.120]  a half inch of space left.
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:44.360]  And then water the rockwool clones
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:46.880]  the same as you do the EasyCloner clones
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:48.880]  and get those under 18 hours or more of light.
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.480]  T5s are good, and again,
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:52.040]  don't get them up real high in temperature.
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:54.000]  Try to stay about 77 degrees.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.240]  That's really important.
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:57.280]  People don't pay enough attention to their temperatures
[02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:58.720]  when they're in veg and that,
[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:01.600]  it doesn't allow you to grow strong, healthy plants
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:03.000]  so that when you're in flower,
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.440]  your plants don't live up to their full potential.
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:08.880]  All right, now here's where the humidity dome and tray
[02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:10.340]  and rockwool cube method go wrong
[02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:12.120]  for a lot of the new growers.
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:13.880]  Your clones have been in 70% humidity
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:14.840]  for most of their lives.
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:18.200]  So once those clones get upset about the lack of humidity,
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:19.800]  it's hard to bring them back.
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:21.920]  Unless you've been taking off the dome daily
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:23.840]  and letting these clones acclimate slowly,
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:24.720]  they're gonna freak out
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:26.840]  when you expose them to the drier atmosphere.
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:29.040]  So I would recommend putting those cupped clones
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:31.840]  that came out of the dome back into the dome
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:33.080]  if you have room.
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:35.000]  I think you can fit about 12 of those cups
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.360]  in one of the domes and tray setups.
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:38.640]  If you can't use the dome,
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:40.560]  you can put a clear cup on top of it,
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:43.120]  get another bag of those solo cups
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:44.400]  and get clear ones this time
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:46.520]  and put those on top of your red cups.
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:48.240]  Or if you accidentally bought clear cups
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:49.080]  in the first place,
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:50.720]  thinking you were gonna put clones into those,
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:51.680]  now you have a use for them
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:54.080]  because they aren't any good for rooting your plants.
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:56.120]  Put that one on top
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:25:58.040]  and it'll work like a dome for each individual plant.
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:25:59.280]  Once they get rooted into the soil,
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:01.520]  they'll be more forgiving to that humidity drop.
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:02.600]  They'll have another life source.
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:05.960]  They won't be so dependent on the moisture in the air
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:08.680]  to live because they'll be able to get moisture
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:11.000]  and sustenance from the roots for survival.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.200]  So give them more and more time without the domes each day
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:14.520]  until they're stable.
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:17.960]  And then in just a few days, they'll be well adjusted.
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:20.960]  So once your clones are into cups and fed,
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:22.520]  be sure to label your clones.
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:23.680]  I talk about this all the time.
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:25.760]  It sucks having a clone that you don't know what it is
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:27.520]  because you got stoned and mislabeled it
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:29.520]  or forgot to label it.
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:30.680]  Then you have to make up a name
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:32.000]  and that just creates more problems.
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:33.960]  So please label your clones.
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:35.320]  So these clones we just put into cups
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:36.760]  are gonna need a few days to adjust
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:38.960]  and dig their roots into the new soil.
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:41.160]  They should be cool in the cups for about 10 to 14 days.
[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:43.320]  You can go a little longer if you really need to.
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:45.160]  I just like to leave them in there until I,
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:46.600]  you can take off the cup off the dirt
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:49.280]  and just see the roots kind of trying to bust out.
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:51.560]  That's when I wanna put them into bigger pots.
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:52.760]  And some guys are gonna ask
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:55.400]  why we don't go to larger pots now and save time.
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:56.760]  Well, here's the answer.
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:58.760]  Larger pots do require more soil,
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:01.360]  which means more nutrients, which means more water.
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:04.040]  Larger pots also take up more space.
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:06.520]  With these cups, we can plant plants
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:08.640]  and enough dirt to let the roots grow
[02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:09.960]  while keeping the water use low,
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:11.760]  which means you don't have to add a lot of nutrients,
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:13.760]  which kind of saves you some time and saves you money,
[02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:15.800]  saves you dirt, saves you space.
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:17.200]  I don't wanna feed nutrients
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.000]  to a three gallon pot full of dirt
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.680]  while I'm only aiming at a cup worth of roots
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:23.160]  is kind of what I'm trying to say.
[02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:25.720]  So I try to be more efficient, more cost-effective.
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:28.800]  Now, once these clones take root
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:30.120]  and they show us they're gonna survive
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:32.360]  and survive that transplant process,
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:34.200]  we'll begin the vegetative growth phase.
[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:35.920]  We'll let them grow in the cups for a couple of weeks
[02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:38.200]  before we repot them into finishing pots
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:40.240]  where they'll veg for a few weeks or a month
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:41.680]  and then they'll begin flowering.
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:43.280]  So we have a long journey ahead of us
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:45.400]  and I hope we can grow a nice crop together.
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:47.240]  Feel like I've been going on and on and on and on.
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:48.680]  So I'm gonna take a dab
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:51.600]  and we'll wrap up the show real quick here.
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:53.680]  Like I've said before, if you have any corrections,
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:56.000]  questions, concerns, or any kind of input,
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.360]  please contact me.
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:59.120]  I was given a great tip from Cut Proof
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:00.080]  and I'm glad he chimed in.
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:02.040]  I wouldn't have thought of that if he didn't say it.
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:03.080]  So don't be shy.
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:06.360]  I know I try to cram a lot of info into one episode
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:07.200]  or into one show,
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:10.200]  so correct me or ask me to elaborate
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:11.800]  on anything you wanna hear more of.
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:13.240]  Don't be shy, I like the interactions.
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:15.280]  You can find me at igrowculture on Twitter,
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:17.440]  igrowculture at hotmail.com,
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:20.240]  or of course there's always a Facebook page.
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:21.400]  All right, I'm gonna take a quick dab
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:23.420]  and I'll be back to wrap up the show.
[02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:25.160]  All right, I'm back to wrap up the show.
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:28.080]  I'm gonna try to get Jesse on for the next episode.
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:29.240]  And then on July 2nd,
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:31.400]  I'm going to be recording the podcast live
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:34.000]  from the Brickyard in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:35.920]  They will be closing down the hookah bar for me.
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:37.200]  It'll be a private party.
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:39.800]  I'm going to see if I can't invite
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:41.240]  some of the podcast listeners
[02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:42.520]  to come down and hang out with us.
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:46.080]  I have to figure out what they're going to allow.
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:49.200]  I may give you guys a password on the next episode
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:50.680]  and then you'll have to use that password
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:51.960]  or something to get in.
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:54.520]  And then only the people that know that are allowed in,
[02:28:54.520 --> 02:28:55.720]  but we have to keep it private
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:58.680]  to be able to do the things we wanna do there.
[02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:00.640]  So this is the portion of the show
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:02.520]  where I give thanks to somebody
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:04.200]  who I feel has been beneficial
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:06.920]  in the evolution of the cannabis movement.
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:09.520]  I was hanging out with a friend of mine a few years ago,
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:13.000]  several years ago, man, this was a long time ago.
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.200]  We were talking about growing weed.
[02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:16.160]  He's an old school grower and an old school reader
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:18.560]  from back in the overgrow days.
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:19.640]  And we were talking and he's like,
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:21.440]  hey, do you know who Soma is?
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:23.000]  And I was like, I don't know who Soma is.
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.960]  And he said, dude, you remind me so much of Soma.
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:26.760]  You need to check him out.
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:29.920]  So I did what any responsible pothead would do.
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:32.160]  I got online and I checked out this guy, Soma.
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:35.860]  Yeah, Soma and I have some related bloodline
[02:29:35.860 --> 02:29:36.800]  somewhere along the line
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:38.880]  because this dude's got dreadlocks down to his ass
[02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:40.600]  and dresses like an old hippie.
[02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:43.520]  This is the original Wookiee right here is Soma.
[02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:48.520]  Soma was born in 1949.
[02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:50.140]  He's probably been growing weed longer
[02:29:50.140 --> 02:29:51.760]  than you've been alive.
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:52.840]  He's the author of the book,
[02:29:52.840 --> 02:29:55.080]  organic marijuana Soma style.
[02:29:55.960 --> 02:29:59.080]  He was accidentally became known as the ganja guru
[02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:01.340]  after developing award-winning cannabis strains.
[02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:03.480]  He's best known for New York City diesel,
[02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:06.240]  amnesia haze, lavender and so Gouda.
[02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:08.240]  Soma's a great dude.
[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:10.500]  Not personally, but through his readings
[02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:11.840]  and his YouTube stuff,
[02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:13.920]  he's taught me a lot of things about memetics
[02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:15.240]  and the vibe of the plant,
[02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:17.980]  which are things that I understood and believed in anyway.
[02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:21.480]  But it's good to see Soma out there doing the organics
[02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:23.400]  and teaching this vibe for the plant,
[02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:25.840]  not just how to grow fat buds,
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:27.800]  but how to love the plant, how to connect with it.
[02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:29.720]  And that's part of what I try to do.
[02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:31.280]  A few of Soma's awards,
[02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:34.960]  his strain winning awards were 1999 reclining Buddha,
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:38.080]  won the Indica category in the high times cannabis cup
[02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:41.360]  and 2001 New York City diesel won the sativa cup
[02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:42.960]  and the high times cannabis cup.
[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:46.800]  In 2002 Buddha sister won the Indica category
[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:49.220]  and New York City diesel won the sativa category
[02:30:49.220 --> 02:30:51.000]  in the cannabis cup.
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:55.920]  2003 amnesia haze won the sativa breeder category
[02:30:55.920 --> 02:30:57.720]  in the 420 IC growers cup.
[02:30:57.720 --> 02:31:00.080]  The list goes on and on and on and on and on.
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:04.960]  This dude's bred, grown and won many, many things.
[02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:07.200]  So I wanted to say thanks to Soma.
[02:31:07.200 --> 02:31:09.260]  If you don't know who Soma is, check him out.
[02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:11.560]  You're probably smoking some of his strains.
[02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:14.680]  I smoked a G13 haze from Soma one time.
[02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:15.960]  It blew my freaking mind.
[02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:17.720]  I would have done all kinds of crazy shit
[02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:19.040]  for a clone or seeds of that,
[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:20.720]  but it was not available at the time.
[02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:22.480]  So I had to live without it.
[02:31:22.480 --> 02:31:23.540]  I'll never forget it.
[02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:25.840]  All right, so shout out to Soma.
[02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:27.680]  We thank you Soma, thank you.
[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:30.480]  Done a lot for my development as a grower, as a breeder.
[02:31:31.700 --> 02:31:33.980]  I'm sure you're doing it for a lot of people in Amsterdam.
[02:31:33.980 --> 02:31:35.160]  Soma is in Amsterdam.
[02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:37.000]  He's not in America.
[02:31:37.740 --> 02:31:38.580]  He doesn't come to the States.
[02:31:38.580 --> 02:31:40.880]  As far as I know, he hasn't been here in years.
[02:31:40.880 --> 02:31:41.960]  So shout out.
[02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:43.280]  I hope you hear the show somehow.
[02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:44.780]  Big love Soma, much respect.
[02:31:46.440 --> 02:31:49.080]  All right, that pretty much wraps up the show.
[02:31:49.080 --> 02:31:52.300]  Check me out on Instagram at iReedGenetics.
[02:31:52.300 --> 02:31:55.320]  Also follow the show on Instagram at iGrowCulture.
[02:31:55.320 --> 02:31:57.260]  There's a Twitter for both of those as well.
[02:31:57.260 --> 02:31:58.640]  There's Facebooks for both of those.
[02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:00.200]  I've given out the email for both of those
[02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:01.560]  a couple of times.
[02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:02.960]  So now that the show's over,
[02:32:03.880 --> 02:32:05.760]  please go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:08.200]  search for iGrowCulture, find the review section,
[02:32:08.200 --> 02:32:10.520]  give me a five-star rating, type in that comment
[02:32:10.520 --> 02:32:12.200]  telling me how awesome the show is.
[02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:14.040]  But even if the show sucks, please give me a comment.
[02:32:14.040 --> 02:32:14.880]  I want to know.
[02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:18.060]  I want to know what's going on with the listeners.
[02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:19.560]  Although I think that if the show sucks,
[02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:22.560]  you probably wouldn't have listened to 35 minutes of it.
[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:23.640]  But still type in some comments.
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:25.840]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[02:32:25.840 --> 02:32:27.400]  I'll probably read your comment on the air.
[02:32:27.400 --> 02:32:28.280]  I hope you're cool with that.
[02:32:28.280 --> 02:32:30.280]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes,
[02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:32.480]  Stitcher, and Swell.am.
[02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:34.920]  And also, every episode is available
[02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:37.920]  on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:39.520]  Shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:32:39.520 --> 02:32:40.680]  Thanks again for listening.
[02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:42.040]  Take a fat dab.
