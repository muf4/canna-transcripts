[00:02.110 --> 00:22.460]  Alright, now here we go.
[00:22.460 --> 00:23.740]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[00:23.740 --> 00:26.300]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:26.300 --> 00:31.060]  This is episode 786 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:31.060 --> 00:33.880]  In this episode, I'm going to answer some listener emails.
[00:33.880 --> 00:36.900]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the great
[00:36.900 --> 00:41.060]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:41.060 --> 00:45.060]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to Dreadlock
[00:45.060 --> 00:46.060]  Farmer.
[00:46.060 --> 00:49.420]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Cannafugget and Grow Dad.
[00:49.420 --> 00:52.580]  Let's send a big fist bump to Simeon and ADHD Grower.
[00:52.580 --> 00:55.740]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to a longtime supporter, our friend Nomi by my
[00:55.740 --> 00:56.940]  guacamole.
[00:56.940 --> 01:00.460]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Larf Night Rises and Noah N.

[01:02.660 --> 01:04.620]  Let's send a thank you shout out to You Betcha.
[01:04.620 --> 01:07.620]  Let's send a fist bump to a longtime supporter, our friend Jeff O.
[01:07.620 --> 01:11.620]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:11.620 --> 01:13.580]  to Levity Love Day.
[01:13.580 --> 01:18.380]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:18.380 --> 01:22.100]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:22.100 --> 01:28.820]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:28.820 --> 01:31.500]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:31.500 --> 01:35.340]  And you know I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:35.340 --> 01:39.300]  it super easy for all of my friends to support the podcast.
[01:39.300 --> 01:42.500]  In the last episode, I did talk about doing a seed giveaway.
[01:42.500 --> 01:46.380]  That's right, our friends at seedsherenow.com are sponsoring a seed giveaway.
[01:46.380 --> 01:50.380]  The winner of the seed giveaway on the last episode was our friend Zach Voss.
[01:50.380 --> 01:52.220]  Congratulations to Zach Voss.
[01:52.220 --> 01:54.460]  All you've got to do my friend is send me an email.
[01:54.460 --> 01:56.460]  Let me know which package of seeds you are hoping for.
[01:56.460 --> 01:59.380]  If I've got those seeds in stock, I will send them to you.
[01:59.380 --> 02:03.460]  However, not everything is available and in stock so you may get a surprise package.
[02:03.460 --> 02:04.580]  You may get some extra packs.
[02:04.580 --> 02:06.220]  You never know what I may do.
[02:06.220 --> 02:07.800]  But Zach, please do send me an email.
[02:07.800 --> 02:11.980]  The email address of course is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[02:11.980 --> 02:15.420]  If you did not win that free pack of seeds on this episode, do not be discouraged because
[02:15.420 --> 02:16.420]  guess what?
[02:16.420 --> 02:19.700]  We're going to give away another pack of seeds toward the end of the show.
[02:19.700 --> 02:20.700]  So that's right.
[02:20.700 --> 02:21.700]  Stay tuned.
[02:21.700 --> 02:25.700]  Keep listening because seedsherenow.com and iRegenetics have teamed up to give away another
[02:25.700 --> 02:27.500]  pack of seeds on this podcast.
[02:27.500 --> 02:29.740]  All right, I don't want to ramble too far.
[02:29.740 --> 02:31.180]  It seems like I get really good at that.
[02:31.180 --> 02:32.620]  I've got a lot to cover.
[02:32.620 --> 02:35.820]  Let's jump into the email portion of today's podcast.
[02:35.820 --> 02:39.140]  The first episode on today's podcast came from our friend who would like to be referred
[02:39.140 --> 02:40.380]  to as Soul Train.
[02:40.380 --> 02:42.260]  Big shout out to my friend Soul Train.
[02:42.260 --> 02:44.260]  The message goes just like this.
[02:44.260 --> 02:48.300]  It says, yo Rasta Jeff, if you should happen to reference on this show, please refer to
[02:48.300 --> 02:49.980]  me as Soul Train.
[02:49.980 --> 02:50.980]  What's up Soul Train?
[02:50.980 --> 02:52.460]  Thank you for all the support my dude.
[02:52.460 --> 02:53.460]  The message continues.
[02:53.460 --> 02:57.940]  It says, I am working my way through all of your older podcasts and I just listened to
[02:57.940 --> 02:59.900]  episode number 580.
[02:59.900 --> 03:01.580]  That's a lot of catching up to do.
[03:01.580 --> 03:03.300]  Thanks for listening to all the old episodes.
[03:03.300 --> 03:08.700]  You guys, people keep asking me for more content, new content, multiple podcasts a week.
[03:08.700 --> 03:13.100]  It's hard for me to do that right now with my work and living and my whole life situation.
[03:13.100 --> 03:17.980]  One podcast a week is what I can do, but there are a lot of older episodes that you can go
[03:17.980 --> 03:18.980]  back and listen to.
[03:18.980 --> 03:20.300]  There are many, many episodes.
[03:20.300 --> 03:25.780]  There are apparently 785 episodes before this one that you can go back and listen to.
[03:25.780 --> 03:28.500]  Unfortunately, YouTube has taken down a few of those.
[03:28.500 --> 03:32.420]  If I show plants in the videos, YouTube likes to take down those videos.
[03:32.420 --> 03:35.220]  There's a video where I cut clones that they took down.
[03:35.220 --> 03:39.020]  There's a video about popping and twisting and lollipopping that they've taken down.
[03:39.020 --> 03:42.700]  They've taken down a lot of the videos where I do any sort of consumption, but YouTube
[03:42.700 --> 03:43.700]  takes some down.
[03:43.700 --> 03:47.780]  Other than YouTube taking them down, most of the videos are still up and available.
[03:47.780 --> 03:50.780]  785 other videos.
[03:50.780 --> 03:54.180]  The first 20 videos, the podcast was called something different.
[03:54.180 --> 03:57.740]  It was called I Grow Culture for a little while for 20 episodes.
[03:57.740 --> 04:02.180]  Then I was informed politely and gently by the form of a cease and desist letter that
[04:02.180 --> 04:05.620]  I Grow Culture was already something being used and I could not use that.
[04:05.620 --> 04:08.860]  We promptly changed the name to the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[04:08.860 --> 04:13.260]  My point is those first 20 episodes are shared in a playlist on the Grow From Your Heart
[04:13.260 --> 04:14.700]  Podcast on YouTube.
[04:14.700 --> 04:16.380]  If you go to my playlist, you can find those.
[04:16.380 --> 04:21.180]  Or if you search I Grow Culture Podcast, those first 20 episodes do come up.
[04:21.180 --> 04:24.180]  780-ish episodes are available of this show.
[04:24.180 --> 04:27.580]  You guys, if you haven't had enough of this rambling, of this beautiful face, of this
[04:27.580 --> 04:31.340]  amazing voice, please go back and listen to those previous episodes.
[04:31.340 --> 04:36.420]  Our friend here, Soul Train, just listened to number 580 and they say, in that podcast,
[04:36.420 --> 04:40.900]  you answered a listener question concerning purple petioles and you mentioned if the plant
[04:40.900 --> 04:44.700]  is also showing crispy leaves, it is likely too much light.
[04:44.700 --> 04:48.140]  Yes, that from what I've read in the rest of your email, that is definitely the case
[04:48.140 --> 04:49.580]  of what's going on here.
[04:49.580 --> 04:50.580]  So let me just keep going.
[04:50.580 --> 04:54.580]  It says, you will be pleased that the least affected strains in the grow are the machine
[04:54.580 --> 05:00.780]  and the blue pill, with the blue pill being by far the happiest looking plant in the tent.
[05:00.780 --> 05:04.800]  It goes on though, it says, while I'm only in my first indoor grow with several different
[05:04.800 --> 05:09.160]  strains and about half of the plants have purple petioles and all of them now are getting
[05:09.160 --> 05:15.100]  some crispy looking leaves, with this being worse on the more purple petiole plants.
[05:15.100 --> 05:19.820]  The plants that have the more purple petioles are showing the purple crispy problem.
[05:19.820 --> 05:22.380]  Just trying to put a bunch of peas into a sentence to be silly there.
[05:22.380 --> 05:23.660]  We get what's going on here.
[05:23.660 --> 05:28.340]  It says, however, at six weeks into 12-12, the buds on all of the plants are looking
[05:28.340 --> 05:29.340]  good.
[05:29.340 --> 05:31.940]  So if you're not familiar with this, you just keep us solidifying the idea that yes,
[05:31.940 --> 05:34.340]  the light is too intense is what's going on here.
[05:34.340 --> 05:39.540]  It says, I am growing in a five by five tent with an HLG Scorpion Diablo light.
[05:39.540 --> 05:40.980]  I'm not super familiar with that light.
[05:40.980 --> 05:41.980]  I have heard a lot about it.
[05:41.980 --> 05:43.500]  I know that HLG makes great shit.
[05:43.500 --> 05:45.060]  I know a lot of people run that light.
[05:45.060 --> 05:46.860]  I know that it is quite powerful.
[05:46.860 --> 05:51.860]  It says, I had the light set 16 inches over the canopy at 50% intensity and things were
[05:51.860 --> 05:53.060]  getting crispy.
[05:53.060 --> 05:58.060]  About 10 days ago, I lifted the light to 26 inches over the canopy at 50% intensity and
[05:58.060 --> 05:59.700]  the plants sure do look happier.
[05:59.700 --> 06:04.540]  So we're giving supporting statements, supporting evidence that this is probably a light issue.
[06:04.540 --> 06:08.860]  You've got that light a little bit too close, maybe turned up too high.
[06:08.860 --> 06:09.860]  You did the right thing.
[06:09.860 --> 06:11.420]  You raised that plant.
[06:11.420 --> 06:14.620]  When you get those new LED lights, I would definitely do whoever you are.
[06:14.620 --> 06:15.900]  I'm talking to everybody out there.
[06:15.900 --> 06:20.780]  If you get a new LED light, I highly recommend doing some research.
[06:20.780 --> 06:22.140]  Research that particular light.
[06:22.140 --> 06:26.100]  Find out how far they recommend you put that plant or that light from your canopy and then
[06:26.100 --> 06:29.940]  go a little bit further and then also reduce the intensity a little bit more than they
[06:29.940 --> 06:31.180]  recommend.
[06:31.180 --> 06:33.980]  Like we've seen here, these plants, they've taken too much light.
[06:33.980 --> 06:34.980]  They will start to burn.
[06:34.980 --> 06:36.140]  The leaves will start to crisp up.
[06:36.140 --> 06:37.140]  They'll turn purple.
[06:37.140 --> 06:38.580]  That will slow down the growth.
[06:38.580 --> 06:39.880]  Things will go wrong.
[06:39.880 --> 06:43.220]  If you get too much light, the leaves crisp up and you can't fix that.
[06:43.220 --> 06:46.700]  If you're not getting enough light, the plants will start to stretch and get a little bit
[06:46.700 --> 06:47.700]  extended.
[06:47.700 --> 06:51.820]  We can turn up the light and fix that more easily than we can take back the crispy leaf.
[06:51.820 --> 06:54.500]  So start lower and slowly ramp yourself up.
[06:54.500 --> 06:57.140]  That's going to be something we talk about here toward the end of this message.
[06:57.140 --> 06:58.300]  It does go on.
[06:58.300 --> 07:01.060]  It says, I did spend a bunch of money.
[07:01.060 --> 07:03.260]  Did I spend a bunch of money on the wrong light?
[07:03.260 --> 07:07.540]  Also is there a strategy I can use for the remaining four weeks that will allow me to
[07:07.540 --> 07:10.740]  increase the intensity setting on the light for my next grow?
[07:10.740 --> 07:13.560]  I believe I will induce CO2 supplementation.
[07:13.560 --> 07:15.100]  That will absolutely help.
[07:15.100 --> 07:16.100]  It'll help with food uptake.
[07:16.100 --> 07:17.580]  It'll help the plants take more light.
[07:17.580 --> 07:20.060]  It'll also help them manage a little bit more heat.
[07:20.060 --> 07:22.300]  But then it says, thanks for all you do.
[07:22.300 --> 07:24.260]  Signed from your friend, Soul Train.
[07:24.260 --> 07:27.300]  There's a little personal joke in there that I almost read out loud that is just between
[07:27.300 --> 07:28.300]  us.
[07:28.300 --> 07:29.300]  I cannot share that with you.
[07:29.300 --> 07:31.580]  Fist bump for the funny joke, bro.
[07:31.580 --> 07:36.460]  So our friend Soul Train, you are absolutely right by moving that light up, by assuming
[07:36.460 --> 07:37.940]  that the light was too intense.
[07:37.940 --> 07:42.340]  One of the major questions that you ask in here is, did I spend a bunch of money on the
[07:42.340 --> 07:43.460]  wrong light?
[07:43.460 --> 07:44.460]  I don't think so.
[07:44.460 --> 07:49.740]  I think if you lifted the light to the top of the tent and turn it down and the plants
[07:49.740 --> 07:52.900]  are small, that intensity for the small plants should work out.
[07:52.940 --> 07:54.940]  And then here's what I want to talk about.
[07:54.940 --> 07:56.620]  What I would have done, it's too late to do this now.
[07:56.620 --> 08:00.540]  This is what I'm going to suggest you do in the future and on future runs.
[08:00.540 --> 08:04.100]  What I would do is raise that light all the way up and turn it as low as it will let you
[08:04.100 --> 08:05.100]  go.
[08:05.100 --> 08:06.100]  That's probably 50 or 30%.
[08:06.100 --> 08:08.580]  Most of those lights only go down to about 50 or 30.
[08:08.580 --> 08:12.860]  So raise the light, turn it down, then start your seedlings or your small plants down on
[08:12.860 --> 08:14.460]  the very low part of that tent.
[08:14.460 --> 08:16.540]  So you've got as much space as possible.
[08:16.540 --> 08:18.740]  Then pay attention to how those plants are acting.
[08:18.740 --> 08:22.180]  Do you need to lower the light a little bit or do you need to raise the intensity a little
[08:22.180 --> 08:23.180]  bit?
[08:23.180 --> 08:25.540]  Pay attention if they're getting stretchy, if they're getting leggy, they may want a
[08:25.540 --> 08:26.540]  little bit more light.
[08:26.540 --> 08:31.060]  I may recommend lowering that light at this time, just a little tiny bit and do not increase
[08:31.060 --> 08:32.060]  the intensity.
[08:32.060 --> 08:35.980]  Just lower the light down so that you can get that light closer to the plants.
[08:35.980 --> 08:39.940]  Then as the plants begin to grow, you can turn that light up just a little bit.
[08:39.940 --> 08:45.460]  I would say turn it up just a small fraction, just maybe 5%, maybe 10%, just a little bit
[08:45.460 --> 08:46.900]  as they start growing.
[08:46.900 --> 08:50.500]  Then if you start seeing shaded, shadowy areas in the tent and the plants aren't growing
[08:50.540 --> 08:53.580]  the maximum efficiency, maybe turn it up just a little bit.
[08:53.580 --> 08:55.340]  Then raise that light all the way to the top.
[08:55.340 --> 08:59.620]  And then now what I do know is when I use the Canon LEDs is that I like to have them
[08:59.620 --> 09:02.940]  about 50% intensity when I put my plants into flower.
[09:02.940 --> 09:05.780]  So I start, I think those go to like 30%.
[09:05.780 --> 09:07.020]  Then I start vegging.
[09:07.020 --> 09:08.140]  I slowly crank them up.
[09:08.140 --> 09:09.140]  They veg a little more.
[09:09.140 --> 09:10.140]  I slowly crank them up.
[09:10.140 --> 09:11.140]  They veg a little more.
[09:11.140 --> 09:12.140]  I slowly crank them up.
[09:12.140 --> 09:15.740]  By the time I go into flower, my lights are at 50% intensity.
[09:15.740 --> 09:18.700]  Then every week or two, I just knock it up just a little bit.
[09:18.700 --> 09:21.300]  So you're going to get 10 weeks in flower in there.
[09:21.300 --> 09:24.380]  We want to go up to, I don't even know if we need to go to 100%.
[09:24.380 --> 09:27.900]  You've got to pay attention to what the plants need, which is going to lead me into the next
[09:27.900 --> 09:28.980]  part that I want to talk about.
[09:28.980 --> 09:30.400]  But I would slowly ramp that up.
[09:30.400 --> 09:34.020]  Don't go from a low intensity, just cranking it all up all the way.
[09:34.020 --> 09:36.540]  I would start low and then slowly over.
[09:36.540 --> 09:38.360]  We've got these plants in there for 100 days.
[09:38.360 --> 09:41.980]  Go from 50 to 100% over that 100 day period.
[09:41.980 --> 09:44.140]  You may not even need to max it all the way out.
[09:44.140 --> 09:47.420]  There's something that we do need to think about though.
[09:47.420 --> 09:48.780]  We can give them too much light.
[09:48.780 --> 09:50.660]  We can also give them the wrong spectrum.
[09:50.660 --> 09:53.700]  If they're not getting the right color, then that's too much wasted light.
[09:53.700 --> 09:56.420]  But something else we should talk about is DLI.
[09:56.420 --> 09:59.660]  The plants will take up so much light and then they will simply have had enough and
[09:59.660 --> 10:01.180]  they will shut off.
[10:01.180 --> 10:02.660]  So you can save electricity.
[10:02.660 --> 10:06.660]  You can save lighting by figuring out the DLI of your specific plant, the daily light
[10:06.660 --> 10:07.660]  integral.
[10:07.660 --> 10:11.540]  Hit that point and then reduce or cut off the lights to save that electricity and that
[10:11.540 --> 10:13.100]  photon energy.
[10:13.100 --> 10:14.940]  Now there's something else we should talk about.
[10:14.940 --> 10:19.300]  This is the technical way to figure out if your plants are getting enough light.
[10:19.300 --> 10:20.620]  This is going to take some equipment.
[10:20.620 --> 10:24.600]  You need a PAR meter here, some sort of a meter that will read how much light is getting
[10:24.600 --> 10:26.220]  to your plants.
[10:26.220 --> 10:29.620]  Some of the cell phone makers do have a decent app for a PAR meter.
[10:29.620 --> 10:32.140]  However, I would recommend a real PAR meter for this.
[10:32.140 --> 10:36.140]  These cell phone apps are not 100% perfect yet.
[10:36.140 --> 10:42.580]  Now if you're going to use a PAR meter, we are looking for a range of 500 to 700 PPFD.
[10:42.580 --> 10:43.840]  Now what is PPFD?
[10:44.400 --> 10:46.760]  This term was all the rage.
[10:46.760 --> 10:47.760]  This was the hot phrase.
[10:47.760 --> 10:51.560]  It used to be terps for a minute and then it was phenotype for a little while.
[10:51.560 --> 10:56.280]  And then for a little while PPFD was the word in the grow industry.
[10:56.280 --> 10:57.280]  What is PPFD?
[10:57.280 --> 11:00.180]  That is photosynthetic photon flux density.
[11:00.180 --> 11:02.200]  What does that really mean?
[11:02.200 --> 11:03.920]  I don't understand a lot about lighting.
[11:03.920 --> 11:08.960]  Let me admit right now, when it comes to lighting in cannabis, that is where I lack knowledge.
[11:08.960 --> 11:09.960]  I know about the plants.
[11:09.960 --> 11:11.600]  I understand the processes of the plants.
[11:11.600 --> 11:12.800]  I understand soil.
[11:12.800 --> 11:16.280]  I understand most of everything that needs to be done to a cannabis plant.
[11:16.280 --> 11:20.560]  But lighting, my brain just doesn't want to absorb that bit of information.
[11:20.560 --> 11:23.400]  My brain isn't interested and my brain's not interested.
[11:23.400 --> 11:25.840]  I just have a hard time learning about that shit.
[11:25.840 --> 11:29.280]  I have a very rudimentary understanding of lighting.
[11:29.280 --> 11:35.240]  So let me try to teach you a very general understanding of PPFD, photosynthetic photon
[11:35.240 --> 11:36.240]  flux density.
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.240]  Right?
[11:37.240 --> 11:38.240]  I think I said it correctly even.
[11:38.240 --> 11:39.240]  Okay, think about this.
[11:39.240 --> 11:42.360]  This is how we measure, say that you've got your light above you.
[11:42.920 --> 11:45.640]  Imagine you could see little raindrops of light falling down.
[11:45.640 --> 11:47.080]  That's basically what we're measuring.
[11:47.080 --> 11:50.200]  How many raindrops of light are coming down from your light?
[11:50.200 --> 11:54.080]  And we'll measure at certain distances from that light to find out the intensity of that
[11:54.080 --> 11:56.040]  light at certain distances.
[11:56.040 --> 12:03.000]  So at your canopy, I would use a PAR meter and the desired PPFD at canopy level is between
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.280]  500 and 700.
[12:05.280 --> 12:07.400]  That is the range that you were looking for.
[12:07.400 --> 12:11.680]  You need a PAR meter or an app or an app on your phone to find that.
[12:11.680 --> 12:13.560]  That is not something that you can do with your eyes.
[12:13.560 --> 12:15.040]  You need a meter for that.
[12:15.040 --> 12:20.080]  So you'd hold the meter right at canopy level and see is that between 500 and 700 PPFD.
[12:20.080 --> 12:23.840]  If it's too hot, too much light, of course, turn those lights down or raise the light.
[12:23.840 --> 12:28.280]  If it's too much, do the opposite, increase the light or lower the light closer to the
[12:28.280 --> 12:29.280]  plants.
[12:29.280 --> 12:32.040]  The thing is when you lower the light, you get a little bit more shadow area because
[12:32.040 --> 12:34.680]  it's not spreading as far, but it is more intense.
[12:34.680 --> 12:37.520]  If you raise that light, you will get less shadows, but it is not intense.
[12:37.520 --> 12:39.860]  So that's one of the things that you've got to figure out there.
[12:39.860 --> 12:42.580]  So a thousand is really high.
[12:42.580 --> 12:46.220]  If you're hitting that thousand PPFD, your plants are going to start showing problems.
[12:46.220 --> 12:49.460]  If you're under 500, you're not going to get that optimal growth.
[12:49.460 --> 12:53.600]  Once again, it seems to me in my studies and the cannabis realm and everything I've looked
[12:53.600 --> 13:01.020]  at online, uh, that between 500 and 700 PPFD is ideal for our ganja plants.
[13:01.020 --> 13:04.320]  So I think you are a spot on with your first assumption that these plants are just getting
[13:04.320 --> 13:06.160]  a little bit too much light.
[13:06.160 --> 13:09.240]  Then the second part of your question was your concern that you spent too much money
[13:09.240 --> 13:13.520]  on this light and you wasted all that money on too much light for your space.
[13:13.520 --> 13:14.840]  I don't think that is the case.
[13:14.840 --> 13:16.680]  I think you've got a good quality light.
[13:16.680 --> 13:21.120]  I think if we figure out how far to keep that light from the canopy, then we'll be in big
[13:21.120 --> 13:22.720]  business because that's a quality light.
[13:22.720 --> 13:23.720]  That's a good company.
[13:23.720 --> 13:26.020]  Uh, and I've never heard bad things about that light.
[13:26.020 --> 13:30.520]  So as long as we keep the appropriate distance between the light and the canopy and we turn
[13:30.520 --> 13:35.120]  that light down to the appropriate, uh, PPFD, the right intensity, then we should get that
[13:35.120 --> 13:36.120]  dialed in.
[13:36.120 --> 13:37.120]  So that's the main thing.
[13:37.120 --> 13:40.840]  The main thing I'm going to recommend, uh, is slowly ramping up the intensity of that
[13:40.840 --> 13:41.840]  light.
[13:41.840 --> 13:43.400]  We don't need all of the light on the seedlings.
[13:43.400 --> 13:46.720]  They just need a little bit of light and as they get bigger, then they can metabolize
[13:46.720 --> 13:49.220]  more, they can be more functional, they can handle more light.
[13:49.220 --> 13:53.060]  So maybe wait till they're a little bit bigger to start giving them that super intense light.
[13:53.060 --> 13:57.900]  So my main advice is to next time, slowly ramp up that light and then pay attention
[13:57.900 --> 13:58.940]  to the PPFD.
[13:58.940 --> 14:03.560]  If you can get that par meter and measure the PPFD at canopy level, you will be golden,
[14:03.560 --> 14:04.560]  my friend.
[14:04.560 --> 14:05.560]  All right.
[14:05.560 --> 14:06.840]  Thank you once again for the great message.
[14:06.840 --> 14:10.920]  Uh, you were six weeks into flower when you sent this, you have probably harvested by
[14:10.920 --> 14:11.920]  now.
[14:11.920 --> 14:12.920]  I'm really curious.
[14:12.920 --> 14:13.920]  How did this crop turn out?
[14:13.920 --> 14:14.920]  How did it look?
[14:14.920 --> 14:15.920]  How did it smell?
[14:15.920 --> 14:16.920]  Have you got to sample it yet?
[14:16.920 --> 14:19.240]  And also let's get that next crop on track.
[14:19.240 --> 14:21.440]  If you've got any questions, please do reach out.
[14:21.440 --> 14:22.440]  We'll get you going.
[14:22.440 --> 14:23.440]  All right.
[14:23.440 --> 14:27.120]  This next email came from our friend, Zach J. Big shout out to our buddy, Zach J for
[14:27.120 --> 14:28.540]  the good question.
[14:28.540 --> 14:30.440]  This one goes a little bit like this.
[14:30.440 --> 14:35.480]  It says, yo Rasta Jeff, I just discovered what I believe are white flies and or fungus
[14:36.400 --> 14:37.400]  gnats.
[14:37.400 --> 14:40.560]  The first thing I would do there, bro, is identify if you've got white flies and or
[14:40.560 --> 14:42.600]  fungus gnats or both.
[14:42.600 --> 14:44.080]  It's very possible that you've got both.
[14:44.080 --> 14:47.860]  It's very likely that you've got both, but if you've only got one or the other, it may
[14:47.860 --> 14:49.800]  be easier to treat for just one.
[14:49.800 --> 14:54.560]  If we know more specifically what we are targeting or we may have to use multiple methods of
[14:54.560 --> 14:56.100]  attack here.
[14:56.100 --> 14:59.500]  But the first step is identify which one you are battling.
[14:59.500 --> 15:00.500]  Are they white?
[15:00.500 --> 15:02.280]  Do they look like a little piece of rice on the stems?
[15:02.800 --> 15:07.240]  When you tap the pots, does it look like ashes come flying out or are they little black bugs?
[15:07.240 --> 15:08.240]  Those are the fungus gnats.
[15:08.240 --> 15:09.340]  The white ones are the white flies.
[15:09.340 --> 15:10.480]  That should be obvious.
[15:10.480 --> 15:13.760]  Let's identify which one we've got in the grow.
[15:13.760 --> 15:14.760]  Then it goes on.
[15:14.760 --> 15:16.800]  There's a little bit here that we're going to skip, but then it goes on to say, I've
[15:16.800 --> 15:20.360]  already ordered neem oil without doing a whole lot of research.
[15:20.360 --> 15:23.240]  Do you have any thoughts on neem oil?
[15:23.240 --> 15:27.380]  Also does a new layer of all purpose sand on top of the soil change the way I need to
[15:27.380 --> 15:30.120]  feed or water my plants at all?
[15:30.120 --> 15:32.800]  Much love and respect from Zach.
[15:32.800 --> 15:33.960]  This is a great question.
[15:33.960 --> 15:37.600]  White flies and fungus gnats are very, very common in a grow.
[15:37.600 --> 15:38.880]  They come in houseplants.
[15:38.880 --> 15:40.800]  They come in all of the soil.
[15:40.800 --> 15:45.560]  If you buy a bagged potting soil, a soilless mix, almost anything in a bag from a grow
[15:45.560 --> 15:51.320]  store, whether it's like your local Randy's Grow or Mike's Grow Shop or if it's Grow Generation
[15:51.320 --> 15:57.440]  or Way to Grow or if it's Home Depot or Lowe's or even Target had Fox Farm soil the last
[15:57.440 --> 15:58.600]  time I was there.
[15:58.600 --> 16:01.760]  All of that soil, people want to blame specific brands.
[16:01.760 --> 16:03.940]  I got this bug from this soil.
[16:03.940 --> 16:05.480]  That soil's got this bug in it.
[16:05.480 --> 16:06.480]  Nah, bro.
[16:06.480 --> 16:08.280]  All the bugs are in all of the soil.
[16:08.280 --> 16:11.520]  They are made in different places, but then they're shipped to a warehouse where they're
[16:11.520 --> 16:16.000]  all put on a pallet together on a dock together, put on a pallet, put on a truck and moved
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.420]  around the country together.
[16:17.420 --> 16:21.000]  Do you think the white flies went, Hey, I like, I like Fox Farms better, or Hey, I like
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.400]  roots organics better.
[16:22.400 --> 16:25.600]  They went, there's a bunch of places to live and they went in all the fucking soil and
[16:25.600 --> 16:26.600]  they lived in all of it.
[16:26.600 --> 16:31.080]  It's just all about where that soil came from, was stored, how it traveled, what it got exposed
[16:31.080 --> 16:32.080]  to.
[16:32.080 --> 16:36.720]  It's your responsibility as the farmer to make sure that there are no bugs in your soil.
[16:36.720 --> 16:40.400]  Anyway, my point is the white flies and fungus gnats, they're very easy to get.
[16:40.400 --> 16:41.680]  They come from all over the place.
[16:41.680 --> 16:42.680]  They're very common.
[16:42.680 --> 16:45.920]  I bet many, many growers have had them in their grow.
[16:45.920 --> 16:49.440]  The fungus gnats are not that big of a deal when there's only a couple of them.
[16:49.440 --> 16:50.440]  They're just kind of annoying.
[16:50.440 --> 16:51.440]  They're gross.
[16:51.440 --> 16:52.440]  They bug you.
[16:52.440 --> 16:53.440]  They make the pictures look like shit.
[16:53.440 --> 16:55.440]  They remind you that you overwatered a little bit.
[16:55.880 --> 16:59.640]  But once you get a lot of fungus gnats, then they can become a vector for disease.
[16:59.640 --> 17:03.660]  If you've got a problem in one plant, those fungus gnats will just move that root disease
[17:03.660 --> 17:06.380]  right over to the other plants or whatever's going on.
[17:06.380 --> 17:10.000]  If you've got a small problem and fungus gnats, the problem compounds.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  Same thing with the white flies.
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.080]  Couple of white flies, they just look annoying.
[17:14.080 --> 17:16.800]  After a little bit, you get a bunch of white flies and it's gross and you're like, I've
[17:16.800 --> 17:18.080]  got a major fucking problem.
[17:18.080 --> 17:20.880]  That's just a hint of the overall health of the garden.
[17:20.880 --> 17:23.040]  So white flies and fungus gnats are very common.
[17:23.040 --> 17:26.840]  One of the most common causes of these bugs is simply, well, they come in, they get in.
[17:26.840 --> 17:28.680]  That's either not caused, they arrive.
[17:28.680 --> 17:31.680]  But the reason they stick around is because of overwatering.
[17:31.680 --> 17:36.040]  They like to be around in that moist soil, that soil right around where your pot drips
[17:36.040 --> 17:39.320]  into the saucer, right around there where there's always that little bit of, there's
[17:39.320 --> 17:43.040]  a dry spot for them to be safe, but enough moisture for them to lay some eggs, have a
[17:43.040 --> 17:44.040]  party, get some water.
[17:44.040 --> 17:46.320]  It feels like the Bahamas there for them.
[17:46.320 --> 17:47.720]  That's where they like to chill.
[17:47.720 --> 17:51.960]  The white flies like to chill just above the top of the soil and climb up your sticks.
[17:51.960 --> 17:55.000]  They like to live right on the stalks of your plants.
[17:55.000 --> 17:56.720]  These are very common bugs.
[17:56.720 --> 17:58.000]  They're very easy to get rid of.
[17:58.000 --> 18:02.400]  Now the first question, the first attempt here was that our listener, Zach J, thought
[18:02.400 --> 18:03.400]  about using neem.
[18:03.400 --> 18:05.560]  I'm going to cut you off right there.
[18:05.560 --> 18:08.560]  I do not like neem oil for anything.
[18:08.560 --> 18:11.560]  There is no application for neem in my garden.
[18:11.560 --> 18:16.800]  In fact, in the state of Colorado, according to the Colorado Department of Health and Environment
[18:16.800 --> 18:21.240]  and the Colorado Department of Ag and the Colorado Medical or the Colorado Marijuana
[18:21.240 --> 18:26.760]  Enforcement Division, all neem based products are banned in commercial cultivation.
[18:26.760 --> 18:31.760]  We can't use neem in cannabis at all legally in commercial cultivation in Colorado.
[18:31.760 --> 18:35.920]  We can do it in our home grow because we're not regulated, but I refuse to use neem for
[18:35.920 --> 18:36.920]  several reasons.
[18:36.920 --> 18:38.580]  First of all, it tastes and smells like shit.
[18:38.580 --> 18:42.920]  If you get neem on your gloves, on your skin, on your clothes, anywhere, it's going to stink
[18:42.920 --> 18:45.880]  so bad forever and it never ever goes away.
[18:45.880 --> 18:49.800]  If you've ever tasted neem, it is one of the worst tasting things ever.
[18:49.800 --> 18:55.220]  If you smoke flowers or a concentrated product and it tastes a little bit fishy and oily
[18:55.220 --> 19:00.280]  and maybe a little bit spicy, that possibly probably was because there was neem oil applied
[19:00.280 --> 19:01.280]  to that flower.
[19:01.280 --> 19:02.320]  The neem oil never goes away.
[19:02.320 --> 19:04.480]  It's going to be there forever in my opinion.
[19:04.480 --> 19:06.000]  I think I can always taste it.
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.880]  That might be in my mind, but I think neem is gross.
[19:08.880 --> 19:11.700]  And also there are many toxic traits to neem.
[19:11.700 --> 19:14.520]  Neem has been banned in many countries for many uses.
[19:14.520 --> 19:19.400]  It's known to do reproductive damage to men and women and it's not good for the environment
[19:19.400 --> 19:20.400]  or your body.
[19:20.400 --> 19:24.400]  So there are a few reasons why I don't recommend to use neem.
[19:24.400 --> 19:28.400]  It just tastes like shit and it doesn't go away and there are better options.
[19:28.400 --> 19:31.260]  Now that I told you I don't like the product you said that you've already ordered, which
[19:31.260 --> 19:36.400]  I do apologize for, let's talk about products that will help you to get rid of these white
[19:36.400 --> 19:38.080]  flies and or fungus gnats.
[19:38.080 --> 19:43.600]  The first thing, step one is let's identify positively, identify what we are battling.
[19:43.600 --> 19:47.500]  If we're battling just white flies, I'm going to recommend just one product.
[19:47.500 --> 19:51.020]  If we're battling fungus gnats, I'm going to recommend a different product.
[19:51.020 --> 19:55.180]  If we've got them both, we may mix up these products together and spray them at the same
[19:55.180 --> 19:56.180]  time.
[19:56.180 --> 20:00.280]  It depends on how strong these bugs are attacking and which one it is.
[20:00.280 --> 20:03.340]  If there's fungus gnats, they are more living in the soil.
[20:03.340 --> 20:06.980]  If they're white flies, they're a little bit in the soil and more on the stalks and under
[20:06.980 --> 20:08.520]  the foliage of the plants.
[20:08.520 --> 20:12.300]  Two different means of treatment, two different modes of attack.
[20:12.300 --> 20:14.100]  But let's talk about it.
[20:14.100 --> 20:16.040]  Let's identify the bugs that you've got.
[20:16.040 --> 20:17.600]  That is the very first step.
[20:17.600 --> 20:20.160]  The second step is let's stop over watering these plants.
[20:20.160 --> 20:21.560]  You did address that here in the message.
[20:21.560 --> 20:24.480]  You understand that part of the problem is from over watering.
[20:24.480 --> 20:25.980]  Let's reduce the water.
[20:25.980 --> 20:27.440]  Also is there standing water?
[20:27.440 --> 20:31.320]  I don't know if your grow is in a commercial building, if it's in your home, if it's in
[20:31.320 --> 20:35.480]  a hotel, if it's a train station, if it's in the city, if it's on a farm, I don't know
[20:35.480 --> 20:40.860]  any of those environmental factors, but possibly you've got water standing somewhere else or
[20:40.860 --> 20:43.260]  a source of moisture somewhere else.
[20:43.260 --> 20:47.500]  Those white flies and fungus gnats will be drawn to that source of moisture as well,
[20:47.500 --> 20:49.060]  as well as all of the other insects.
[20:49.060 --> 20:53.700]  They're going to come to the water first, warm water, aroma, the bugs are going to show
[20:53.700 --> 20:54.700]  up.
[20:54.700 --> 20:58.260]  So let's get rid of the water, the over water, the excessive water, the lingering moisture.
[20:58.260 --> 20:59.260]  They're like mosquitoes.
[20:59.260 --> 21:00.260]  They're going to come where there's water.
[21:00.260 --> 21:01.260]  So let's get rid of that.
[21:01.260 --> 21:05.580]  Now let's identify a couple of pesticides that I would recommend for.
[21:05.580 --> 21:06.980]  Let's start with the white flies.
[21:06.980 --> 21:11.780]  If you have just got white flies, I would do a little bit of defoliation.
[21:11.780 --> 21:13.980]  We probably need to defoliate anyway.
[21:13.980 --> 21:16.240]  The white flies are going to be hiding under the leaves.
[21:16.240 --> 21:17.340]  Let's pull off some leaves.
[21:17.340 --> 21:18.340]  Let's glove up.
[21:18.340 --> 21:21.340]  Let's put on some clothes we don't really like a whole lot and go defoliate.
[21:21.340 --> 21:25.380]  Let's just go manually remove a bunch of the white flies from the room and also remove
[21:25.380 --> 21:27.620]  their hotel, take away their party spot.
[21:27.620 --> 21:28.620]  They won't come to party.
[21:28.620 --> 21:30.500]  So let's defoliate a little bit.
[21:30.500 --> 21:35.060]  Put all of those defoliated leaves into a trash bag that you can tie up and seal and
[21:35.060 --> 21:36.660]  remove from the grow environment.
[21:36.660 --> 21:41.080]  If you've got a fire pit, put that bad bitch in the fire pit and burn those fucking leaves.
[21:41.080 --> 21:42.080]  Get rid of them.
[21:42.080 --> 21:44.000]  We don't want those white flies coming back.
[21:44.000 --> 21:45.960]  Let's do a little bit of defoliation.
[21:45.960 --> 21:49.640]  Now here's another trick that you may laugh at, but this is definitely going to work.
[21:49.640 --> 21:53.360]  I get a shop vac and I put the shop vac nozzles kind of big.
[21:53.360 --> 21:56.760]  I've got a little taper device that makes the shop vac nozzle smaller.
[21:56.760 --> 22:01.200]  I will smack the plants with a stick and as the white flies come flying out, I suck them
[22:01.200 --> 22:02.200]  up with the shop vac.
[22:02.200 --> 22:04.000]  They're going to fly directly to the light.
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.520]  Stay right there near the light.
[22:05.520 --> 22:06.520]  Smack the plant.
[22:06.520 --> 22:07.520]  They come flying out.
[22:07.520 --> 22:09.380]  You're just sucking them up as they come out.
[22:09.380 --> 22:10.640]  That's one good way to get rid of them.
[22:11.200 --> 22:12.680]  They're going to suck up a bunch into the vacuum.
[22:12.680 --> 22:15.600]  If you've got the shop vac with the filter bag in there, I recommend that because they're
[22:15.600 --> 22:16.600]  tiny.
[22:16.600 --> 22:17.880]  You want to catch the little fucker.
[22:17.880 --> 22:21.120]  So defoliate, shop vac a bunch of them off.
[22:21.120 --> 22:27.840]  Then at this point, this is when I would consider a foliar application of a product called Monterey
[22:27.840 --> 22:29.160]  Garden Spray.
[22:29.160 --> 22:31.200]  I usually don't recommend specific products.
[22:31.200 --> 22:32.760]  Nobody pays me for this.
[22:32.760 --> 22:36.240]  This is the product to use for this.
[22:36.240 --> 22:40.200]  There is a beneficial bacteria in Monterey Garden Spray.
[22:40.200 --> 22:41.760]  I call it BT.
[22:41.760 --> 22:45.720]  It may be pronounced Bacillus thuringiensis or something similar to that.
[22:45.720 --> 22:48.200]  I'm not the best guy at pronouncing shit, but I can read well.
[22:48.200 --> 22:49.200]  I could see it on the paper.
[22:49.200 --> 22:50.760]  I recognize it.
[22:50.760 --> 22:54.920]  That ingredient in that product is going to eliminate the white flies.
[22:54.920 --> 22:59.480]  It is a fungus that occurs in the bottom of rum barrels and they've learned how to make
[22:59.480 --> 23:01.080]  a pesticide out of that.
[23:01.080 --> 23:02.200]  We apply that to the plants.
[23:02.200 --> 23:06.600]  It is basically harmless to the plants, but the white flies, they want nothing to do with
[23:06.600 --> 23:11.720]  it so that BT will get rid of the white flies that will also slow down your fungus gnats.
[23:11.720 --> 23:15.920]  Now let's focus more on the fungus gnat and the white fly combination.
[23:15.920 --> 23:19.020]  Let's say you got both of these bad bitches attacking the garden.
[23:19.020 --> 23:22.400]  The white flies, like I mentioned, are going to stay mainly on the foliage.
[23:22.400 --> 23:25.640]  They may go a little bit into your dirt, but they're going to stay mostly on the foliage,
[23:25.640 --> 23:27.960]  mostly on the underside of the leaves.
[23:27.960 --> 23:30.560]  The fungus gnats are going to burrow down into the soil.
[23:30.560 --> 23:33.160]  So the fungus gnats are going to be down in your roots.
[23:33.160 --> 23:37.440]  So to take care of them, we need to do more than just spraying a foliar application.
[23:37.440 --> 23:40.760]  We may need to do what is called a soil dredge.
[23:40.760 --> 23:45.400]  That is where you take an amount of water, how much you ever water your plants usually,
[23:45.400 --> 23:47.880]  mix up that much water, get that much water.
[23:47.880 --> 23:55.080]  And to that mix of water, we are going to add 15 to 30 milliliters per gallon of evergreen
[23:55.080 --> 23:56.600]  pyrethrum spray.
[23:56.600 --> 23:58.200]  The product is called evergreen.
[23:58.200 --> 24:00.040]  It's mainly pyrethrum based.
[24:00.040 --> 24:03.800]  It's a very good product for getting rid of fungus gnats, white flies, and most of your
[24:03.800 --> 24:05.400]  basic common pests in the garden.
[24:05.400 --> 24:09.640]  Honestly, this is one of my go-to pesticides, one of my most recommended pesticides.
[24:09.640 --> 24:11.680]  It is simply called evergreen.
[24:11.680 --> 24:14.880]  In my opinion, it's affordable and it's very effective.
[24:14.880 --> 24:19.600]  And it is also approved by the Colorado Department of Agriculture, the Colorado Department of
[24:19.600 --> 24:23.320]  Public Health and Environment, and the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[24:23.320 --> 24:25.920]  So the product is called evergreen.
[24:25.920 --> 24:30.000]  I would mix up the water and I would water the plants with the evergreen solution.
[24:30.000 --> 24:37.360]  Again, somewhere between 15 and 30 milliliters of evergreen per gallon of water, 15 to 30
[24:37.360 --> 24:38.560]  per gallon.
[24:38.560 --> 24:41.640]  So you're going to mix up that water and water it right through the plants.
[24:41.640 --> 24:43.640]  This will stress the root zone of your plants.
[24:43.640 --> 24:47.840]  The plants will show you that they were a little bit bothered by this, but one, maybe
[24:47.840 --> 24:51.760]  two applications of this will get rid of your soil-borne pests.
[24:51.760 --> 24:55.740]  Most of anything in that soil will go away.
[24:56.560 --> 25:01.700]  So depending on the level of the infestation and the strength of your plants, that would
[25:01.700 --> 25:05.060]  help me determine how much of this product to put in the water.
[25:05.060 --> 25:06.820]  Somewhere between 15 and 30 mils.
[25:06.820 --> 25:09.300]  If the bugs are real bad, you want that 30 mils.
[25:09.300 --> 25:12.820]  But if the roots aren't super strong, go closer to 15 milliliters.
[25:12.820 --> 25:14.420]  You can figure this one out.
[25:14.420 --> 25:19.780]  Mix that up, water the plants, then wait a couple of days, then water it again with this
[25:19.780 --> 25:20.860]  same solution.
[25:20.860 --> 25:21.860]  Do it again.
[25:21.860 --> 25:23.960]  If they didn't look too beat up the first time, do it again.
[25:23.960 --> 25:27.320]  If they got the shit beat out of them on the first try, maybe wait on this, but then
[25:27.320 --> 25:30.040]  water them again with the same solution.
[25:30.040 --> 25:34.000]  That second application should knock out all of the root-borne problems.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.460]  Then after that, I recommend watering with a really nice mix of nutrients and put a bunch
[25:38.460 --> 25:42.800]  of microbes in there to resupply the microbes to that rhizosphere, get everything back in
[25:42.800 --> 25:44.240]  action in that pot.
[25:44.240 --> 25:45.360]  The bugs are gone.
[25:45.360 --> 25:46.400]  Let's get the roots banging.
[25:46.400 --> 25:48.120]  Let's get the roots healthy again.
[25:48.120 --> 25:53.460]  Now while I'm doing these root dredges, I would also do a foliar application of either
[25:53.460 --> 25:56.040]  the Monterey Garden Spray or the Evergreen.
[25:56.040 --> 25:57.880]  Let's hit the top and the bottom.
[25:57.880 --> 26:03.480]  If we just soak the soil or the cocoa or whatever the plants are in, the bugs are going to go
[26:03.480 --> 26:06.740]  up and hang out on the leaves and fly around and just go other places.
[26:06.740 --> 26:10.020]  And then when all that shit dries, they'll go back.
[26:10.020 --> 26:13.440]  We got to hit the foliage too, so there's nowhere for these bugs to go.
[26:13.440 --> 26:15.280]  Hit the foliage with the Evergreen.
[26:15.280 --> 26:16.820]  Hit the soil with the Evergreen.
[26:16.820 --> 26:21.060]  I would do the foliar spray and the dredge on the first day and then wait two or three
[26:21.060 --> 26:25.660]  days, maybe four days, depending on your wet and dry cycles, and do it all over again.
[26:25.660 --> 26:29.680]  Now all the bugs should be gone with those two applications if it is fungus gnats and
[26:29.680 --> 26:31.100]  or white flies.
[26:31.100 --> 26:34.980]  Other pests may have a little more resistance, but that should bang out your problem.
[26:34.980 --> 26:40.720]  So really quickly, if it's fungus gnats, then we're going to use Evergreen at 15 to 30 milliliters
[26:40.720 --> 26:41.780]  per gallon.
[26:41.780 --> 26:44.900]  We're going to do a soil dredge and a foliar application.
[26:44.900 --> 26:48.780]  Then we're going to wait three, maybe five days and repeat the process.
[26:48.780 --> 26:54.800]  If it is only white flies, let's just spray frequently with the BT, the Monterey Garden
[26:54.800 --> 26:57.960]  spray with the Bacillus thuringiensis in there.
[26:57.960 --> 27:02.580]  Let's hit that like day one, day three, day six, and then we'll wait and see how they
[27:02.580 --> 27:03.580]  look.
[27:03.580 --> 27:06.020]  Maybe do it again on day 10, but they should be going away by then.
[27:06.020 --> 27:08.740]  If not, you've got a bigger problem than I realized.
[27:08.740 --> 27:12.820]  We've got to get in there and make some nuclear measures or perhaps start thinking about letting
[27:12.820 --> 27:16.060]  go some of those predator bugs.
[27:16.060 --> 27:20.220]  There are plenty of predator bugs that will get in there and destroy your fungus gnats
[27:20.220 --> 27:21.420]  and your white flies.
[27:21.420 --> 27:25.780]  All right, my friend, Zach J., I think I answered most of your question.
[27:25.780 --> 27:32.100]  On my notes here, it says Bacillus thuringiensis from Monterey Garden spray or Evergreen, stop
[27:32.100 --> 27:34.100]  over watering, shop vac.
[27:34.100 --> 27:37.220]  Another thing I wrote down was yellow cards.
[27:37.220 --> 27:42.100]  I'd recommend putting some yellow sticky traps in the garden, some at soil level, some right
[27:42.100 --> 27:45.220]  below the bottom of the canopy, and some at the top of the canopy.
[27:45.220 --> 27:47.900]  That will help you identify the presence of pests.
[27:47.900 --> 27:51.540]  Those yellow sticky traps are not there to eradicate bugs in any way.
[27:51.540 --> 27:54.340]  They are there to alert and indicate the presence of pests.
[27:54.340 --> 27:57.560]  That will let you monitor your progress in your battle.
[27:57.560 --> 28:01.400]  If there are more there yesterday than there are today, you're making progress.
[28:01.400 --> 28:05.300]  If there's more there tomorrow than there were today, they're making progress.
[28:05.300 --> 28:09.860]  You've got to adjust your measures based on the progress which you and those bugs are
[28:09.860 --> 28:10.860]  making.
[28:11.260 --> 28:12.420]  I wish you the best of luck.
[28:12.420 --> 28:15.980]  You're going to win, bro, because you've got technology and me on your side.
[28:15.980 --> 28:17.860]  You are backed by the IRE Army.
[28:17.860 --> 28:20.820]  All right, Zach J., thank you for the great question.

[28:39.260 --> 28:40.260]  Click on there.
[28:40.660 --> 28:43.220]  It will ask you a few questions like, are you growing indoors, outdoors?
[28:43.220 --> 28:44.680]  What strain are you growing?
[28:44.680 --> 28:46.500]  Ask a few basic preliminary questions.
[28:46.500 --> 28:49.820]  Then we give you the opportunity to type in the problem with your plants.
[28:49.820 --> 28:50.820]  Ask me your question.
[28:50.820 --> 28:51.900]  Let me know what's going on.
[28:51.900 --> 28:54.100]  There's also a space to attach images.
[28:54.100 --> 28:56.060]  You can send photos of the garden.
[28:56.060 --> 28:59.740]  If you need some help or have some questions or something just doesn't look right in your
[28:59.740 --> 29:00.980]  garden, send me a message.
[29:00.980 --> 29:02.620]  I'd be more than happy to help you out.
[29:02.620 --> 29:05.500]  I may even use it here on the podcast for content.
[29:05.500 --> 29:06.500]  All right.
[29:06.500 --> 29:09.540]  At the top of the show, we did give away a pack of seeds sponsored by our friends at
