[00:00.000 --> 00:03.480]  All right, welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:03.480 --> 00:08.520]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 612 of the Grow From Your
[00:08.520 --> 00:09.520]  Heart Podcast.
[00:09.520 --> 00:12.660]  In this episode, I'm going to read a few grow questions.
[00:12.660 --> 00:16.960]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:16.960 --> 00:22.040]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:22.040 --> 00:23.400]  level or higher.
[00:23.400 --> 00:26.960]  So with no further ado, let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast.

[00:49.640 --> 00:53.320]  shout out to my friend, ADHD Grower.
[00:53.320 --> 00:57.560]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:07.080 --> 01:09.780]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:09.780 --> 01:13.340]  And of course, there is a link in the show notes or the video description to make it
[01:13.340 --> 01:17.880]  nice and easy for all of my friends who have got their hands full or need a reminder in
[01:17.880 --> 01:19.080]  the future.
[01:19.080 --> 01:21.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.880]  I am coming to you on a frosty cold Colorado evening.
[01:24.880 --> 01:27.360]  We have been seeing negative numbers in the temperatures.
[01:27.360 --> 01:28.560]  It is ridiculously cold.
[01:28.560 --> 01:29.760]  I hope you are warm.
[01:29.760 --> 01:30.760]  I hope you are safe.
[01:30.760 --> 01:33.120]  I hope you have got power wherever you are.
[01:33.120 --> 01:35.560]  A lot of places right now do not have electricity.
[01:35.560 --> 01:36.720]  People are freezing.
[01:36.720 --> 01:37.720]  People are cold.
[01:37.720 --> 01:38.720]  People are hungry.
[01:38.720 --> 01:41.680]  I hope you're warm, safe, dry, all of the important shit.
[01:41.680 --> 01:45.480]  Most importantly, I hope you are smoking something completely delicious.
[01:45.480 --> 01:47.360]  I hope your eyes are nice and red.
[01:47.360 --> 01:52.280]  Hope you're having a wonderful morning, daytime, nighttime, evening time, whatever time it
[01:52.280 --> 01:53.480]  is wherever you are.
[01:53.480 --> 01:56.760]  I hope it's close to 710 or 420.
[01:56.760 --> 01:58.960]  I'm awful rambly in this episode.
[01:58.960 --> 02:01.280]  That may work out to your advantage.
[02:01.280 --> 02:05.240]  I wanted to talk about, I walked into the grow room just a couple of days ago.
[02:05.240 --> 02:06.920]  It was super fucking cold.
[02:06.920 --> 02:10.000]  I looked at the ceiling and I thought, is there a leak upstairs?
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.680]  Because there were water bubbles all over my ceiling.
[02:12.680 --> 02:17.400]  It looked like it had a little bit of water coming down the wall on the poly, the panda
[02:17.400 --> 02:18.880]  film that's on the floor.
[02:18.880 --> 02:20.840]  There was a little bit of water in one corner.
[02:20.840 --> 02:22.520]  I got real paranoid really quickly.
[02:22.520 --> 02:23.960]  I thought, what the fuck happened?
[02:23.960 --> 02:25.780]  Where's all this water coming from?
[02:25.800 --> 02:28.940]  I turned off anything that made a lot of noise and I listened for water running.
[02:28.940 --> 02:30.320]  There's no water running.
[02:30.320 --> 02:35.420]  It dawned on me that it's fucking negative 17 degrees outside and it's 75 degrees in
[02:35.420 --> 02:37.280]  that grow space.
[02:37.280 --> 02:39.660]  There might be some condensation forming in some places.
[02:39.660 --> 02:40.860]  I was a little bit freaked out.
[02:40.860 --> 02:43.340]  I've never seen that happen in my grow space before.
[02:43.340 --> 02:46.940]  I thought I had a leak or a flood or some major fucking problems.
[02:46.940 --> 02:51.500]  Turns out it was condensation, all that warmth and the outside cold air meeting.
[02:51.500 --> 02:54.140]  That is a potential for powdery mildew.
[02:54.140 --> 02:55.580]  That's a potential for some problems.
[02:55.580 --> 02:56.980]  I did increase my airflow.
[02:56.980 --> 03:00.660]  I did increase the amount of air going out of that room.
[03:00.660 --> 03:02.380]  I'm really doing what I can.
[03:02.380 --> 03:04.780]  These temperatures and these times right now, this is crazy.
[03:04.780 --> 03:08.980]  This is one of the coldest winters I can remember as a grower.
[03:08.980 --> 03:12.140]  A shout out to all the folks that have been struggling in cold winter grows for a long
[03:12.140 --> 03:13.140]  time.
[03:13.140 --> 03:15.300]  This is a good reminder to get your plants up off the ground.
[03:15.300 --> 03:16.460]  I've talked about that before.
[03:16.460 --> 03:19.660]  If you're in a cold environment, get your plants up off the ground.
[03:19.660 --> 03:23.060]  They don't want to be sitting on that cold floor with water in there.
[03:23.060 --> 03:26.780]  It's going to make them not eat, not feed, not grow, not perform.
[03:26.780 --> 03:27.780]  They're going to be pissed off.
[03:27.780 --> 03:29.220]  So it's cold, you guys.
[03:29.220 --> 03:30.340]  That is what I'm saying.
[03:30.340 --> 03:31.820]  It's fucking cold.
[03:31.820 --> 03:33.460]  Adjust your grow room accordingly.
[03:33.460 --> 03:34.900]  Make sure you're not getting condensation.
[03:34.900 --> 03:38.060]  Make sure you're not screwing up your grow here in the winter time.
[03:38.060 --> 03:42.180]  Use that cold to your advantage, but don't cause yourself any problems.
[03:42.180 --> 03:43.620]  Where else are we going to go from there?
[03:43.620 --> 03:46.020]  Oh, I want to give a giant congratulations.
[03:46.020 --> 03:47.340]  Let me look directly into the camera here.
[03:47.340 --> 03:50.940]  I want to give a giant congratulations to two of my good friends.
[03:50.940 --> 03:55.380]  Jake, congratulations to Giant Mike and the Dabbing Queen on your marriage.
[03:55.380 --> 03:56.380]  Congratulations, guys.
[03:56.380 --> 03:57.380]  I'm proud of you.
[03:57.380 --> 03:58.380]  I'm excited for you.
[03:58.380 --> 03:59.380]  I'm happy for you.
[03:59.380 --> 04:04.100]  I don't know what else to say, but shout out to Giant Mike and the Dabbing Queen on their
[04:04.100 --> 04:05.100]  marriage.
[04:05.100 --> 04:06.100]  Congratulations, you guys.
[04:06.100 --> 04:08.300]  It's good to see two beautiful people attached.
[04:08.300 --> 04:09.300]  You guys belong together.
[04:09.300 --> 04:10.300]  I've met you.
[04:10.300 --> 04:11.300]  I've hung out with you.
[04:11.300 --> 04:12.700]  No doubt in my mind, you two are meant to be together.
[04:12.700 --> 04:13.700]  Congrats, guys.
[04:13.700 --> 04:17.780]  I hope that goes well forever for the rest of all of our lives for eternity.
[04:17.780 --> 04:18.780]  Love you guys.
[04:18.780 --> 04:19.780]  Big respect.
[04:19.780 --> 04:23.620]  I'm going to take some celebratory dabs whenever we're allowed.
[04:23.620 --> 04:24.860]  I don't know how long that's going to be.
[04:24.860 --> 04:26.260]  We may have to break some rules, guys.
[04:26.260 --> 04:28.140]  This may be cause for breaking some rules.
[04:28.140 --> 04:29.140]  Don't send me hate mail.
[04:29.140 --> 04:30.140]  Don't send me email.
[04:30.140 --> 04:31.140]  That's just how shit goes.
[04:31.140 --> 04:32.140]  We've been on lockdown for a fucking year, you guys.
[04:32.140 --> 04:33.860]  I want to take some dabs with my friends.
[04:33.860 --> 04:35.580]  Don't get mad at me for thinking about it.
[04:35.580 --> 04:37.540]  Every man's got his fantasy.
[04:37.540 --> 04:41.300]  Also, so congrats to Giant Mike and the Dabbing Queen on their marriage.
[04:41.300 --> 04:42.620]  Now let me give a disclaimer.
[04:42.620 --> 04:44.820]  I said Giant Mike, not White Mike.
[04:44.820 --> 04:47.140]  White Mike has been married for quite some years.
[04:47.140 --> 04:48.140]  He's got a lovely wife.
[04:48.140 --> 04:50.180]  I'm not going to drop her name on here.
[04:50.180 --> 04:53.900]  But Mike, White Mike that comes on the show has been chained down for quite some time.
[04:53.900 --> 04:56.260]  He's got a lovely wife, two kids.
[04:56.260 --> 04:59.060]  So congrats a long time ago on your wedding, buddy.
[04:59.060 --> 05:00.300]  But that's not the Mike I'm talking about.
[05:00.300 --> 05:03.260]  So you guys don't send that Mike wedding congratulations.
[05:03.260 --> 05:04.260]  That'll be confusing.
[05:04.260 --> 05:06.100]  He won't know what the fuck you're talking about.
[05:06.100 --> 05:07.660]  But shout out to White Mike.
[05:07.660 --> 05:09.980]  Also shout out to Mrs. White Mike.
[05:09.980 --> 05:11.900]  I'm not going to drop her name on the show.
[05:11.900 --> 05:13.500]  She probably would appreciate that.
[05:13.900 --> 05:19.020]  Once again, congrats to the official Giant Mike and the Dabbing Queen on the marriage.
[05:19.020 --> 05:21.060]  I told you I was rambling, you guys.
[05:21.060 --> 05:22.060]  It's your fault.
[05:22.060 --> 05:23.060]  You showed up.
[05:23.060 --> 05:24.060]  No, it's not your fault.
[05:24.060 --> 05:25.060]  I took the dabs, not you.
[05:25.060 --> 05:26.340]  Where are we going to go from here?
[05:26.340 --> 05:28.640]  How do we pull this shit out of the weeds?
[05:28.640 --> 05:31.180]  We go right to the email section.
[05:31.180 --> 05:34.260]  This part of the podcast is where I'm going to answer grow questions.
[05:34.260 --> 05:39.400]  These grow questions came from, this one came from the grow help tab on my website.
[05:39.400 --> 05:44.320]  If you visit my website, I read genetics.com, there's a spot where it says grow help.
[05:44.320 --> 05:46.240]  You can ask your grow questions.
[05:46.240 --> 05:48.480]  We ask a short list of preliminary questions.
[05:48.480 --> 05:51.640]  We ask you basic things like, uh, what strain are you growing?
[05:51.640 --> 05:53.160]  Are you growing indoors or outdoors?
[05:53.160 --> 05:55.000]  What kind of lights are you using?
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.680]  Just a few things to give me some hints at what can solve your problem.
[05:58.680 --> 05:59.720]  Just to makes it easier for me.
[05:59.720 --> 06:01.040]  It's like going to the doctor.
[06:01.040 --> 06:04.040]  They want to know your blood pressure, your heart rate, your temperature, how much you
[06:04.040 --> 06:05.040]  weigh.
[06:05.040 --> 06:08.320]  A few basic questions before you even see the doc, just to give me a hint.
[06:08.320 --> 06:12.720]  This is like giving the doctor a few couple of basic questions before we get to see the
[06:12.720 --> 06:13.720]  patient.
[06:13.720 --> 06:15.720]  Uh, we're going to jump right to that part.
[06:15.720 --> 06:16.720]  Sorry.
[06:16.720 --> 06:17.720]  I'm so rambly today.
[06:17.720 --> 06:18.720]  You guys, I took some dabs.
[06:18.720 --> 06:19.720]  Uh, what did I dab?
[06:19.720 --> 06:23.560]  It was bubblegum TKD 1000 and it fucking worked.
[06:23.560 --> 06:25.760]  Um, just cause some people ask what am I dabbing?
[06:25.760 --> 06:27.040]  Some people don't care to hear it.
[06:27.040 --> 06:28.340]  This one came from that grow help tab.
[06:28.340 --> 06:31.840]  If you go to, I read genetics.com, click on the grow help tab, fill out the little grow
[06:31.840 --> 06:32.840]  help tab.
[06:32.840 --> 06:34.420]  It will send you to the part where you can ask a question.
[06:34.420 --> 06:36.520]  This one came from our friend.
[06:36.520 --> 06:38.800]  Uh, I put in here name to use on the podcast.
[06:38.800 --> 06:41.680]  They did not answer that part, so we're not going to say their name.
[06:41.680 --> 06:42.680]  We're going to skip that.
[06:42.680 --> 06:44.840]  The strain they are growing is motor breath.
[06:44.840 --> 06:45.840]  Number 15.
[06:45.840 --> 06:48.400]  They're growing it indoors under led lighting.
[06:48.400 --> 06:50.520]  They're in the vegetative stage of growth.
[06:50.520 --> 06:54.800]  They're about four weeks into veg and they're growing in cocoa.
[06:54.800 --> 06:57.120]  The last feed was at the time of this email.
[06:57.120 --> 06:59.160]  It was today, February 10th.
[06:59.160 --> 07:01.840]  The pH of that feeding was 6.1 so far.
[07:01.840 --> 07:02.840]  We're doing good.
[07:02.840 --> 07:06.200]  We've gone up a little higher on the pH, but so far so good.
[07:06.200 --> 07:09.600]  Uh, P PM or EC of the last feeding was 700.
[07:09.600 --> 07:11.600]  We're all in the right ranges there.
[07:11.600 --> 07:13.440]  Daytime temperature is 68 to 70.
[07:13.440 --> 07:16.320]  You could come up a little bit, but it's cold as fuck.
[07:16.320 --> 07:18.160]  I'm not mad at you for being a little bit cold.
[07:18.160 --> 07:20.920]  Uh, it's cold as shit in my growth spaces right now too.
[07:20.920 --> 07:23.240]  Can't do much about it, but plug in more lights.
[07:23.240 --> 07:25.520]  Going to run out of lights in space pretty soon here.
[07:25.520 --> 07:27.600]  Nighttime temperature is 64 to 66.
[07:27.600 --> 07:29.280]  That is acceptable.
[07:29.280 --> 07:32.720]  Daytime relative humidity is 60%.
[07:33.120 --> 07:34.120]  Nighttime 55%.
[07:34.120 --> 07:37.120]  That's acceptable within acceptable range there.
[07:37.120 --> 07:39.320]  Uh, where do we go from here?
[07:39.320 --> 07:40.320]  Uh, the problem.
[07:40.320 --> 07:42.120]  Hey man, I love your content.
[07:42.120 --> 07:43.640]  So this is my second grow.
[07:43.640 --> 07:48.640]  First grow had almost no issues, but on this one I'm having droopy fan leaves.
[07:48.640 --> 07:51.400]  Now droopy fan leaves can be a lot of signs of a lot of different things.
[07:51.400 --> 07:52.400]  There is a picture included.
[07:52.400 --> 07:54.640]  We'll, uh, I'll add that here in just a moment.
[07:54.640 --> 07:57.440]  Uh, the droopy fan leaves are on the old and new growth.
[07:57.440 --> 07:59.360]  I'm growing in the basement in tents.
[07:59.360 --> 08:01.600]  I know my temps have been kind of cold.
[08:01.600 --> 08:03.360]  So that's an indicator right there.
[08:03.360 --> 08:06.520]  Uh, but I'm having trouble pinpointing this issue.
[08:06.520 --> 08:10.960]  I'm a legal caregiver, so I'm worried because my patients are depending on me to pump out
[08:10.960 --> 08:13.880]  the dank like I did last run.
[08:13.880 --> 08:17.960]  Um, it's your second grow and you're a caregiver.
[08:17.960 --> 08:20.600]  You got a little bit of cart before the horse syndrome there.
[08:20.600 --> 08:24.240]  I would master growing, not master it, but at least get comfortable at it.
[08:24.240 --> 08:27.280]  Get really good at it before you've got a lot of people relying on you.
[08:27.280 --> 08:31.880]  I appreciate and respect what you're doing, but, uh, get good at this before you get too
[08:31.880 --> 08:34.520]  many people relying on you too much.
[08:34.520 --> 08:38.800]  Uh, that's none of my business, I guess, but that's my advice as a, as a caregiver.
[08:38.800 --> 08:42.400]  I've been a caregiver, was a caregiver, uh, since the beginning of the medical stuff here
[08:42.400 --> 08:43.560]  in Colorado.
[08:43.560 --> 08:46.640]  My advice is get good before you get people relying on you that way.
[08:46.640 --> 08:48.880]  Uh, you're never worried about your patients.
[08:48.880 --> 08:50.280]  Anyway, let me get back on track.
[08:50.280 --> 08:52.320]  It says my nutrients are house and garden.
[08:52.320 --> 08:53.900]  I'm also using recharge.
[08:53.900 --> 08:59.060]  I'm definitely not under watering, but I know I'm watering less often this run than last.
[08:59.060 --> 09:01.460]  It's cold, so they're probably not drinking as much.
[09:01.460 --> 09:04.580]  I do have a picture here that's going to give me some details and help me out.
[09:04.580 --> 09:08.220]  I hand water at 10 to 20% runoff when the pots get light.
[09:08.220 --> 09:14.860]  I have a 480 watt led quantum board in each tent with infinity T6 inline fans.
[09:14.860 --> 09:16.220]  Any help is greatly appreciated.
[09:16.220 --> 09:18.940]  All right, I've got the, uh, the photo here in my laptop.
[09:18.940 --> 09:20.580]  I'm going to jump to that real quickly.
[09:20.580 --> 09:22.260]  I just have a lot going on here.
[09:22.260 --> 09:25.660]  So I can tell by looking at this photo that I'm going to post right about here in the
[09:25.660 --> 09:26.660]  video.
[09:26.660 --> 09:30.300]  There are several hints here as to what's going wrong in this photo.
[09:30.300 --> 09:34.500]  The first thing that I can see is that if you look at the bottom and the little catch
[09:34.500 --> 09:39.340]  tray, the saucer in which the pot is sitting, there's quite a bit of standing water in that
[09:39.340 --> 09:46.060]  pot and the condition of that pot, the outer moisture here on the outside of the pot, the
[09:46.060 --> 09:50.980]  color of that runoff water inside of that pot of the saucer, the condition of the saucer
[09:51.100 --> 09:56.180]  indicate to me that this plant sits in water too often.
[09:56.180 --> 09:58.060]  So it's being over watered.
[09:58.060 --> 10:00.500]  It's sitting in that over watering for too long.
[10:00.500 --> 10:05.020]  It's sitting in this water at the bottom of the tray for too long and it's cold.
[10:05.020 --> 10:09.500]  Basically you're putting this plant's feet, maybe it's balls in cold water.
[10:09.500 --> 10:13.500]  Imagine if I just sat you, let me fix my hat so you could see my face here.
[10:13.500 --> 10:18.300]  Imagine if I just sat you, your feet, your toes, your balls in cold water all day long
[10:18.300 --> 10:19.540]  and just made you deal with it.
[10:19.580 --> 10:21.540]  It's kind of what you're doing to this plant.
[10:21.540 --> 10:25.820]  So I think the main issue is that it is simply over watered.
[10:25.820 --> 10:29.000]  The secondary issue that it's sitting in that water for too long.
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.180]  Your third issue, which is just compounding everything else is that that cold water in
[10:33.180 --> 10:35.340]  which it is sitting is cold.
[10:35.340 --> 10:39.540]  You do have them up on those little tiny risers, but that water is still getting cold.
[10:39.540 --> 10:42.180]  There's nothing to stop that water from getting a little bit chilly.
[10:42.180 --> 10:43.900]  So they're unhappy with that water.
[10:43.900 --> 10:46.220]  I'm looking to see what else I can see by your picture.
[10:46.220 --> 10:50.180]  I think if you got the temperature under control in there and stopped over watering,
[10:50.180 --> 10:53.180]  I think that those plants would be less droopy.
[10:53.180 --> 10:56.780]  In my opinion, the main thing causing this droop is over water.
[10:56.780 --> 10:59.980]  The second thing is they're sitting in that stagnant water for too long.
[10:59.980 --> 11:02.460]  The third thing is they're probably a little bit too cold.
[11:02.460 --> 11:03.460]  That water is too cold.
[11:03.460 --> 11:05.680]  The plants are overall too cold.
[11:05.680 --> 11:10.180]  Another reason which will lead to plants doing a droop like this, however, I don't think
[11:10.180 --> 11:14.380]  this is what's happening here, but this is a possibility for other people with droopy
[11:14.380 --> 11:15.380]  leaves.
[11:15.540 --> 11:16.540]  I've seen this happen a couple of times.
[11:16.540 --> 11:20.380]  When your plants reach their daily light integral, they will just take a break.
[11:20.380 --> 11:21.780]  They'll just droop their leaves down.
[11:21.780 --> 11:23.180]  That means they've had enough light.
[11:23.180 --> 11:25.180]  Daily light integral, DLI.
[11:25.180 --> 11:28.940]  Like basically, if you're at work and you're done and you're tired and you lean against
[11:28.940 --> 11:32.260]  the wall and you go, ah, that's what the plants are doing.
[11:32.260 --> 11:33.580]  They've been working all day.
[11:33.580 --> 11:34.980]  They don't have a wall to lean against.
[11:34.980 --> 11:36.720]  They just go, shit, I'm tired.
[11:36.720 --> 11:39.300]  They just put their leaves down and they take a little bit of a break.
[11:39.300 --> 11:43.660]  They're telling you, I've had my daily light integral, unless you want to keep me on so
[11:43.740 --> 11:46.180]  that I don't flower, you could possibly reduce the light.
[11:46.180 --> 11:48.500]  You could reduce the amount of lumens I'm getting.
[11:48.500 --> 11:51.140]  You could do changes based on what you're seeing on those plants.
[11:51.140 --> 11:55.940]  But what I think is happening here, honestly, is it's a basic overwater, which is compounding
[11:55.940 --> 11:58.380]  into multiple issues because of the environment.
[11:58.380 --> 11:59.900]  Let me read my notes.
[11:59.900 --> 12:02.100]  Make sure I didn't miss anything on the notes.
[12:02.100 --> 12:03.340]  You do have lots of standing water.
[12:03.340 --> 12:04.540]  It's probably cold.
[12:04.540 --> 12:05.540]  Get them up off the floor.
[12:05.540 --> 12:07.860]  You do have those little tiny risers.
[12:07.860 --> 12:08.980]  That may be sufficient.
[12:08.980 --> 12:09.980]  I don't know.
[12:09.980 --> 12:11.540]  I don't know how cold that floor is.
[12:11.540 --> 12:13.860]  You said you're in the basement in a tent.
[12:13.860 --> 12:16.540]  That floor may be getting colder than you're anticipating.
[12:16.540 --> 12:20.100]  You may want to double or triple those little risers.
[12:20.100 --> 12:23.100]  Maybe get another pot, flip the pot upside down, put it on there.
[12:23.100 --> 12:24.180]  That may help you out.
[12:24.180 --> 12:29.980]  Honestly, I think the main issue is the overwater and the cold water sitting in there.
[12:29.980 --> 12:30.980]  All right.
[12:30.980 --> 12:32.860]  Big thanks to my friend who did not include their name.
[12:32.860 --> 12:34.540]  I do appreciate the content.
[12:34.540 --> 12:37.580]  Let me know how it goes when you dry those plants out a little bit.
[12:37.580 --> 12:42.700]  One recommendation I can make while I'm thinking about it, you seem to be overwatering your
[12:42.700 --> 12:43.700]  plants.
[12:43.700 --> 12:47.140]  I have done a podcast episode called Water Tech 1-5.
[12:47.140 --> 12:50.620]  I don't recall the episode number right off the top of my head, but through the magic
[12:50.620 --> 12:54.940]  of technology, I'll drop that episode number right about here in the video.
[12:54.940 --> 12:57.620]  That way you guys can watch 1-5 Water Tech.
[12:57.620 --> 12:59.020]  It's just an audio podcast.
[12:59.020 --> 13:00.020]  There is a video that goes with it.
[13:00.020 --> 13:03.180]  I think it's just my face or a static screen, some sort of image.
[13:03.180 --> 13:04.580]  It's an older show.
[13:05.020 --> 13:09.380]  That will give you great advice on how to water these plants without so many issues.
[13:09.380 --> 13:11.700]  I would do something about that standing water.
[13:11.700 --> 13:15.460]  You're getting 10% to 20% runoff, but it's just sitting in that tray.
[13:15.460 --> 13:16.460]  That's not ideal.
[13:16.460 --> 13:18.620]  I would maybe get a shop vac and suck that out.
[13:18.620 --> 13:22.220]  Or maybe, I don't know, you got to do something about that standing water.
[13:22.220 --> 13:24.260]  Shop vac is probably the ideal way.
[13:24.260 --> 13:28.300]  If you raise them up off of something, up off the ground onto something, you can put
[13:28.300 --> 13:30.260]  a container underneath there.
[13:30.260 --> 13:34.100]  With that plastic saucer that you're using, you can push the edge of it like your finger
[13:34.100 --> 13:37.460]  with your finger and make like a spout like on a pitcher, like a tea pitcher.
[13:37.460 --> 13:40.420]  You can just make that little corner and the water will pour right out of there into a
[13:40.420 --> 13:42.180]  vessel that you could slide underneath.
[13:42.180 --> 13:43.900]  But I would get the water out of there.
[13:43.900 --> 13:44.900]  That would help you out.
[13:44.900 --> 13:48.940]  1-5 Water Tech, once again, that episode number should be right about here-ish.
[13:48.940 --> 13:49.940]  That'll help you out.
[13:49.940 --> 13:54.260]  All right, I'm going to move on to the next question in today's episode.
[13:54.260 --> 13:58.180]  This one comes from our friend Zee, nice and easy.
[13:58.180 --> 14:04.080]  It says, sir, I've heard a bucket of bro science stating that taking clones from clones from
[14:05.060 --> 14:07.560]  clones and so on degrades the quality.
[14:07.560 --> 14:08.560]  Is this true?
[14:08.560 --> 14:10.160]  Thanks, and keep it up.
[14:10.160 --> 14:16.640]  So what this person is asking is, if I have got a plant and I cut a clone of that plant
[14:16.640 --> 14:19.920]  and I grow that plant, that plant is now going to become this hand for those who are watching
[14:19.920 --> 14:20.920]  the video.
[14:20.920 --> 14:21.920]  I've got this plant.
[14:21.920 --> 14:22.920]  I cut this part off.
[14:22.920 --> 14:25.000]  I've got two plants now, right?
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.440]  Eventually this one's going to go away and I've only got plant number two now, I guess
[14:28.440 --> 14:31.940]  we're going to call it, which is just a clone of plant number one.
[14:31.940 --> 14:35.780]  So eventually I'm going to cut clones off of plant number two and I'm going to put plant
[14:35.780 --> 14:39.220]  number two in the flower room and I'm going to use the clones, which are now clone number
[14:39.220 --> 14:41.220]  three and I'm going to keep those around.
[14:41.220 --> 14:42.900]  I'll keep one as a mom plant.
[14:42.900 --> 14:46.620]  Eventually I'll throw some of those in the flower room, some more along the line.
[14:46.620 --> 14:50.260]  I'll have to cut clones off of number three and make clone number four.
[14:50.260 --> 14:51.580]  Clone number three will get too tired.
[14:51.580 --> 14:52.980]  I'll need to refresh it.
[14:52.980 --> 14:59.740]  So in the long run, if you do it correctly, if you follow standard operating procedures,
[14:59.740 --> 15:05.220]  if your donor plants do not get any stress or overwhelming stress or overwhelming diseases
[15:05.220 --> 15:11.500]  or overwhelming pest pressure, in most cases you will not see any change in those genetics.
[15:11.500 --> 15:12.680]  It will be the same plant.
[15:12.680 --> 15:16.460]  You will not degrade the quality on those genetics in any way.
[15:16.460 --> 15:22.140]  It will still be the same thing if you follow standard operating procedures and you use
[15:22.140 --> 15:27.020]  healthy donor plants and you take clones properly, you transplant them and you care for them
[15:27.020 --> 15:28.380]  in a proper manner.
[15:28.420 --> 15:31.180]  They will not degrade in any way.
[15:31.180 --> 15:34.540]  I recently got rid of my flow mother plant.
[15:34.540 --> 15:36.220]  No offense to flow.
[15:36.220 --> 15:37.780]  I just had grown that.
[15:37.780 --> 15:39.020]  I bred it to everything.
[15:39.020 --> 15:41.340]  It was time for that to be retired.
[15:41.340 --> 15:45.620]  As a Colorado cannabis grower, with the personal grow, I'm very limited to the amount of plants
[15:45.620 --> 15:46.980]  I'm allowed to play with.
[15:46.980 --> 15:50.540]  I've been growing flow since 2007.
[15:50.540 --> 15:56.100]  I think in 2019 or 2020, I finally decided to let it go.
[15:56.100 --> 15:59.500]  I had that plant for over 10 years.
[15:59.500 --> 16:00.500]  Over 10 years.
[16:00.500 --> 16:04.580]  The only way I could do that was by cutting a clone of it every time that bigger plant
[16:04.580 --> 16:07.260]  got tired, got ugly, got out of shape.
[16:07.260 --> 16:08.580]  Just cut a clone of that.
[16:08.580 --> 16:10.700]  Get that clone, root it, get that going.
[16:10.700 --> 16:14.820]  I probably went through 20 different clone generations of that flow plant.
[16:14.820 --> 16:18.940]  Big shout out to my friends at Medimar for getting me that clone.
[16:18.940 --> 16:24.780]  There's rumor that that came from Ed Rosenthal through Tom Sexton, then to me.
[16:24.820 --> 16:27.620]  I don't know if I should have said all those names, but that's the rumor.
[16:27.620 --> 16:33.660]  That clone that went from DJ Short to Ed Rosenthal to Tom to myself is the rumor where that clone went.
[16:33.660 --> 16:35.060]  It got spread all over Colorado.
[16:35.060 --> 16:38.100]  I wasn't the only one with it, but it was a great cut.
[16:38.100 --> 16:40.260]  I kept it from 2007.
[16:40.260 --> 16:42.540]  I bred everything to it.
[16:42.540 --> 16:44.220]  I cloned it a bunch of times.
[16:44.220 --> 16:45.940]  I got it from that person.
[16:45.940 --> 16:46.940]  I bred to it.
[16:46.940 --> 16:47.940]  I grew it.
[16:47.940 --> 16:48.940]  I just keep repeating the same shit.
[16:48.940 --> 16:49.940]  I had it for 10 years.
[16:49.940 --> 16:51.540]  Finally, I got tired of it.
[16:51.540 --> 16:54.140]  Everything smelled like flow in my life for a little while.
[16:54.500 --> 16:55.500]  I smoked it.
[16:55.500 --> 16:56.500]  I consumed it.
[16:56.500 --> 16:57.500]  I dabbed it.
[16:57.500 --> 16:58.700]  Eventually, you got to get rid of things.
[16:58.700 --> 17:00.340]  Like I said a moment ago, I'm a breeder.
[17:00.340 --> 17:01.340]  I'm in Colorado.
[17:01.340 --> 17:02.340]  I'm limited by plants.
[17:02.340 --> 17:03.580]  I wanted to make new things.
[17:03.580 --> 17:05.380]  I wanted to make new creations.
[17:05.380 --> 17:08.380]  Unfortunately, the flow plant is one of the things that had to go.
[17:08.380 --> 17:13.900]  But until then, I kept that bad bitch around for over 10 years by cutting a clone of it.
[17:13.900 --> 17:14.900]  It moved with me.
[17:14.900 --> 17:17.620]  I moved to two different houses with that plant.
[17:17.620 --> 17:19.180]  I had a plant.
[17:19.180 --> 17:20.180]  I had a crop of flow.
[17:20.180 --> 17:23.100]  I had a mother plant and I had a crop of flow in flower.
[17:23.100 --> 17:25.260]  I thought, shit, I got to move when this crop is over.
[17:25.260 --> 17:29.340]  So I just cut a tray of all of my mother plants, like 10 of every mother plant in the tray
[17:29.340 --> 17:34.340]  of clones, put them in the car, moved, set up the new grow space, put those new clones
[17:34.340 --> 17:35.700]  in their new home.
[17:35.700 --> 17:38.420]  That's how the new clones got moved to the new spot.
[17:38.420 --> 17:41.460]  That flow has survived two moves of different houses.
[17:41.460 --> 17:43.460]  It's been moved all around the country.
[17:43.460 --> 17:48.340]  So no, in the long run, the short answer is no, there will not be any change.
[17:48.340 --> 17:50.340]  If things are done properly, I need to repeat that.
[17:50.340 --> 17:52.260]  The mother plant needs to be happy.
[17:52.420 --> 17:57.060]  There needs to be no viral pressure, no pest pressure, no stress.
[17:57.060 --> 17:59.900]  Just needs to be a healthy plant that hasn't been worked out.
[17:59.900 --> 18:03.780]  And then you need to take clones properly, transplant them properly.
[18:03.780 --> 18:07.980]  Then you should have quality copies of copies of copies.
[18:07.980 --> 18:12.860]  If you do it correctly, it's not like multiplicity where they keep coming out a little dumber.
[18:12.860 --> 18:15.940]  It's not like the copy machine where they keep getting a little bit diluted.
[18:15.940 --> 18:18.860]  If you do it correctly, they should come out just fine.
[18:18.860 --> 18:20.780]  Let me adjust the iRi Army beanie here.
[18:20.780 --> 18:22.420]  It keeps crawling into my eyes.
[18:22.420 --> 18:25.660]  Trying to keep my face visible and be professional.
[18:25.660 --> 18:26.540]  All right, let's keep going.
[18:26.540 --> 18:29.660]  We do have a couple of more minutes here on this podcast episode.
[18:29.660 --> 18:32.580]  This question also came from the Grow Help tab.
[18:32.580 --> 18:35.380]  This one came from, they want us to use the name NB.
[18:35.380 --> 18:36.860]  Shout out to my new friend, NB.
[18:36.860 --> 18:38.460]  Thank you for the great question.
[18:38.460 --> 18:44.260]  It says they are growing granddaddy perps and Y-East Farms horchata.
[18:44.260 --> 18:45.460]  There's a string called horchata.
[18:45.460 --> 18:46.420]  That sounds good.
[18:46.420 --> 18:47.540]  I like horchata.
[18:47.540 --> 18:49.540]  They're growing it indoors under LED lighting.
[18:49.580 --> 18:51.020]  The plants are in veg.
[18:51.020 --> 18:52.300]  They're in a soilless mix.
[18:52.300 --> 18:54.060]  I like these details so far.
[18:54.060 --> 18:56.900]  They're using FloraFlex Bloom 1, Bloom 2.
[18:56.900 --> 18:58.340]  The EC is 1.7.
[18:58.340 --> 19:00.420]  The pH is 6.4.
[19:00.420 --> 19:02.340]  Daytime temperature, 75 degrees.
[19:02.340 --> 19:05.620]  Nighttime temperature, 65 degrees.
[19:05.620 --> 19:06.220]  Where are we?
[19:06.220 --> 19:08.780]  Relative humidity, 40% day and night.
[19:08.780 --> 19:11.380]  Here is the part that says the problem.
[19:11.380 --> 19:12.620]  It says, hello, Rasta Jeff.
[19:12.620 --> 19:13.860]  Thank you for your podcast.
[19:13.860 --> 19:15.420]  I've learned so much.
[19:15.420 --> 19:17.460]  You're very welcome, and thank you for the great content.
[19:17.460 --> 19:20.340]  You are contributing to the show right now, and I appreciate that.
[19:20.340 --> 19:25.540]  It says, I was running a 4x2 flower tent while simultaneously running a veg tent.
[19:25.540 --> 19:27.580]  We got a flower tent and a veg tent.
[19:27.580 --> 19:31.580]  I decided to save on electricity and bring the veg plants into the flower tent for a
[19:31.580 --> 19:33.900]  few hours a day.
[19:33.900 --> 19:37.580]  You're moving plants from one room to another to save on electricity.
[19:37.580 --> 19:41.820]  Are you really saving electricity by cramming all of your plants into one space?
[19:41.820 --> 19:43.780]  Those plants may want the space.
[19:43.780 --> 19:46.820]  You may be better off just leaving them in the other room.
[19:46.860 --> 19:50.540]  After we see the problem you ran into, we determine you may be better off just leaving
[19:50.540 --> 19:52.780]  them in the other room overall.
[19:52.780 --> 19:56.340]  I understand you want to bring them in there and use that space, but hopefully your flower
[19:56.340 --> 20:00.180]  space is full, all that light is being used, and you want to give those plants, the veg
[20:00.180 --> 20:01.700]  plants, as much light as they can get.
[20:01.700 --> 20:02.700]  I don't know your situation.
[20:02.700 --> 20:03.700]  That's just my assumption.
[20:03.700 --> 20:06.340]  I would leave them where they are so they can get all that light.
[20:06.340 --> 20:07.740]  Anyway, it goes on.
[20:07.740 --> 20:13.980]  It says, I just noticed that one of the flowering plants seems to be a hermaphrodite.
[20:13.980 --> 20:15.580]  The dreaded intersex plant.
[20:15.580 --> 20:17.500]  Those are always a fucking scare.
[20:17.500 --> 20:20.820]  It says, I realized the power strip had a small light bulb in it.
[20:20.820 --> 20:24.860]  Thanks to your light leak episode, I realized, I assumed that was the cause.
[20:24.860 --> 20:26.220]  That could definitely be the cause.
[20:26.220 --> 20:27.660]  Any sort of light leak may do it.
[20:27.660 --> 20:31.940]  It says, am I in danger of pollinating the vegging plants?
[20:31.940 --> 20:33.500]  The veg plants are all in week four.
[20:33.500 --> 20:36.300]  They spend two to three hours in a flower tent.
[20:36.300 --> 20:38.100]  I realized this was a mistake.
[20:38.100 --> 20:41.900]  Should I pop some new seeds or wait three months for more disappointing results?
[20:41.900 --> 20:42.900]  All right.
[20:43.220 --> 20:46.180]  I've got a very simple answer to this one.
[20:46.180 --> 20:49.400]  The simple answer to this one is you have nothing to worry about.
[20:49.400 --> 20:52.700]  The flowering plants in your tent, I hope nobody saw me spit on the microphone just
[20:52.700 --> 20:53.700]  now.
[20:53.700 --> 20:54.700]  If you did, I apologize.
[20:54.700 --> 20:55.700]  I'm human.
[20:55.700 --> 20:56.700]  Shit happens.
[20:56.700 --> 20:57.700]  Not even going to edit that.
[20:57.700 --> 21:01.780]  If you've got other plants which are in flower in that tent, the flowering plants are at
[21:01.780 --> 21:04.680]  risk of being pollinated and having seeds in them.
[21:04.680 --> 21:11.560]  The other plants which are somewhere between 21 and about 35 days in flower, those do risk
[21:11.560 --> 21:12.620]  being pollinated.
[21:13.340 --> 21:15.100]  You won't get too many seeds.
[21:15.100 --> 21:16.300]  The pistils are shriveling up.
[21:16.300 --> 21:18.100]  They're not super pollinatable right now.
[21:18.100 --> 21:23.440]  But if they're at peak pollination times and that hermaphrodite popped up, you may see
[21:23.440 --> 21:26.600]  some pollination on the other plants which are in flower.
[21:26.600 --> 21:28.820]  You did not ask about flowering plants.
[21:28.820 --> 21:32.300]  What you asked about is are your vegetative plants going to get seeded?
[21:32.300 --> 21:35.500]  The simple answer is no, not at all.
[21:35.500 --> 21:37.980]  Those plants have not reached sexual maturity.
[21:37.980 --> 21:40.300]  They're not putting out their sex organs yet.
[21:40.300 --> 21:44.660]  The parts which they need to receive pollen to produce seeds are not even existent on
[21:44.660 --> 21:45.660]  those plants yet.
[21:45.660 --> 21:48.700]  So no, you do not have anything to worry about.
[21:48.700 --> 21:51.380]  Those vegetative plants will not receive pollen.
[21:51.380 --> 21:52.980]  They will not be pollinated.
[21:52.980 --> 21:55.420]  You've got a long way to go before you have to worry about that.
[21:55.420 --> 22:00.220]  The thing you should do is make sure you deal with that hermaphroditic plant in some way.
[22:00.220 --> 22:01.220]  Are you going to get rid of it?
[22:01.220 --> 22:02.540]  Are you going to pluck the nanners out?
[22:02.540 --> 22:04.060]  Are you going to isolate it?
[22:04.060 --> 22:06.840]  What's going to happen with that freak of nature?
[22:06.840 --> 22:11.160]  Then once that crop is done and that herm is out of there, you need to thoroughly clean
[22:11.160 --> 22:12.160]  that room.
[22:12.160 --> 22:13.280]  Make sure there's no pollen in there.
[22:13.280 --> 22:15.080]  Water will deactivate your pollen.
[22:15.080 --> 22:16.640]  Get in there and just spray everything.
[22:16.640 --> 22:17.740]  Maybe cover up the lights.
[22:17.740 --> 22:19.280]  Maybe hand wipe the lights or something.
[22:19.280 --> 22:22.600]  But we've got to get in there and get a lot of water in the room and deactivate all of
[22:22.600 --> 22:24.920]  the pollen that may have been released.
[22:24.920 --> 22:29.760]  So the short answer to your question is you have nothing to worry about because vegetative
[22:29.760 --> 22:32.740]  plants don't have the appropriate parts to receive pollen.
[22:32.740 --> 22:34.740]  So no, they will not get pollinated.
[22:34.740 --> 22:38.180]  The parts of your plants that receive pollen, when you put them into flower and they start
[22:38.180 --> 22:43.180]  making the dandelion parts, the little pistils, the hairs, the stigmas, that is where the
[22:43.180 --> 22:44.220]  pollen lands.
[22:44.220 --> 22:46.620]  That's what will get your plants pregnant and get them seeded.
[22:46.620 --> 22:49.780]  So at this time, you don't have anything to worry about.
[22:49.780 --> 22:51.620]  Big shout out to my new friend NB.
[22:51.620 --> 22:55.180]  I hope your granddaddy perp and your horchata go well.
[22:55.180 --> 22:56.420]  I hope I answered your question.
[22:56.420 --> 22:59.220]  If you've got any more questions, please follow up.
[22:59.220 --> 23:00.700]  Love to help you out.
[23:00.700 --> 23:01.700]  Big shout out.
[23:01.700 --> 23:02.700]  All right.
[23:02.700 --> 23:03.700]  Where are we going from there?
[23:03.700 --> 23:04.860]  Let's go to a couple of more messages.
[23:04.860 --> 23:08.660]  Let's find, this is the one that I want a right here.
[23:08.660 --> 23:09.740]  All right.
[23:09.740 --> 23:11.740]  This one says, what's up Rasta Jeff.
[23:11.740 --> 23:15.520]  I've got a quick question that I think may be valuable to the listeners and definitely
[23:15.520 --> 23:16.780]  to me.
[23:16.780 --> 23:21.460]  I've heard you mention on a few episodes that you use salt based nutrients to grow.
[23:21.460 --> 23:22.460]  Yes, I do.
[23:22.460 --> 23:24.700]  I mostly use new millennium bottle nutrients.
[23:24.700 --> 23:27.860]  A lot of times I also use a veg bloom powdered nutrients.
[23:27.860 --> 23:29.460]  In the personal grow, I use one mix.
[23:29.460 --> 23:32.980]  In a commercial grow, I use another mix, but those are the main bases.
[23:33.260 --> 23:34.660]  Yes, salt based nutrients.
[23:34.660 --> 23:37.340]  I'm a bottled grower, not the organic guy.
[23:37.340 --> 23:42.140]  It works better in a commercial environment in my opinion for what I'm doing, for my budget,
[23:42.140 --> 23:46.620]  for my space, and also for training grow techs.
[23:46.620 --> 23:50.580]  It's just easier to have bottles that I can say, put this many milliliters of this at
[23:50.580 --> 23:52.380]  this day and this many mils.
[23:52.380 --> 23:54.520]  So I do use the bottle nutrients.
[23:54.520 --> 24:00.340]  It goes on to say, I am assuming you are breeding everything with those same salt based nutrients.
[24:00.340 --> 24:01.340]  That is accurate.
[24:01.620 --> 24:06.060]  It says, is there any scientific evidence that shows when breeding with salt based nutrients,
[24:06.060 --> 24:11.140]  there are any discrepancies in a future grower using those seeds in super soil without salt
[24:11.140 --> 24:14.540]  based nutrients?
[24:14.540 --> 24:16.100]  I have my seeds tested.
[24:16.100 --> 24:17.100]  Excuse me.
[24:17.100 --> 24:23.980]  I have my seeds tested in all types of environments, in living soil, in soil, in hydroponics, in
[24:23.980 --> 24:26.020]  rock wool, in cocoa.
[24:26.020 --> 24:29.220]  I have them ran organically, non-organically.
[24:29.220 --> 24:34.580]  I have them grown with love and grown with abuse and I don't see any difference in the
[24:34.580 --> 24:39.420]  organic to non-organic production when it comes to how viable that seed is.
[24:39.420 --> 24:40.460]  They all germinate well.
[24:40.460 --> 24:41.460]  They all grow well.
[24:41.460 --> 24:46.180]  I haven't seen any difference in that to tell you the honest truth.
[24:46.180 --> 24:52.060]  The thing you're talking about is called epigenetics and that's in, let me take a quick drink here.
[24:52.060 --> 24:53.060]  My voice is crackling.
[24:53.060 --> 24:54.060]  You guys don't want to hear that.
[24:54.060 --> 24:56.460]  We're just going to take a drink and deal with it on the show.
[24:56.460 --> 24:57.860]  It's better than hearing that nonsense.
[24:57.860 --> 24:58.860]  Excuse me for one moment.
[24:58.860 --> 25:09.900]  All right.
[25:09.900 --> 25:13.220]  I'm freshened up.
[25:13.220 --> 25:19.980]  Now let me start by saying I have no qualifications or I don't, I am just talking out of my ass
[25:19.980 --> 25:23.100]  right now, but this is what I think.
[25:23.100 --> 25:28.180]  For that to be a factor, we have to think about what did the breeder of these seeds
[25:28.180 --> 25:29.580]  before me do?
[25:29.580 --> 25:34.380]  Whoever made the mother plant and the father plant that I used, what did they do?
[25:34.380 --> 25:38.500]  Then whoever made the mother plant and the father plant of that one, what type of soil
[25:38.500 --> 25:41.540]  or soilless mix or media did they use?
[25:41.540 --> 25:46.200]  Because evolutionary things like this aren't going to happen over one cycle.
[25:46.200 --> 25:49.780]  In my opinion, I started this by saying, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about,
[25:49.780 --> 25:54.740]  but as I think about it, evolution isn't going to happen just by me.
[25:54.740 --> 25:55.740]  Maybe it is.
[25:55.740 --> 25:58.080]  I pollen chuck, I do breeding, I'm changing things.
[25:58.080 --> 26:03.500]  Evolution is happening by me selecting things, but I don't think that I'm imprinting the
[26:03.620 --> 26:07.940]  seeds enough with one cycle in my breeding mix.
[26:07.940 --> 26:11.220]  I don't think the plant knows, it may know, the plant knows.
[26:11.220 --> 26:16.420]  I don't think the seed knows that I'm growing in salts and I don't think it's going to make
[26:16.420 --> 26:19.700]  a difference, but I could be completely wrong.
[26:19.700 --> 26:24.180]  Keep in mind, I said I started this by saying I don't have the scientific background, the
[26:24.180 --> 26:25.980]  education on this topic.
[26:25.980 --> 26:29.700]  I know that it's epigenetics is what we're talking about, but I think that it's going
[26:29.700 --> 26:35.340]  to take more generations than just my one breeding round to really make a difference
[26:35.340 --> 26:36.780]  in that topic.
[26:36.780 --> 26:39.100]  I wish I had more details and info on that.
[26:39.100 --> 26:40.660]  Honestly, I don't have that education.
[26:40.660 --> 26:42.060]  I haven't gone to school.
[26:42.060 --> 26:45.340]  I probably need some more deep science than what I've got for that.
[26:45.340 --> 26:49.220]  I've got a lot of bro science.
[26:49.220 --> 26:53.140]  People kind of diss me sometimes because I obviously am not a college student.
[26:53.140 --> 26:54.420]  I don't do the college thing.
[26:54.420 --> 26:59.300]  I'm not educated from any botanical school, no horticultural degree or anything like that.
[26:59.900 --> 27:01.780]  What I've got though is a lot of experience.
[27:01.780 --> 27:04.060]  I've been growing since before I should admit it.
[27:04.060 --> 27:05.420]  I've been around a lot of plants.
[27:05.420 --> 27:06.420]  I've had a lot of crops.
[27:06.420 --> 27:10.140]  I've grown in commercial, private environments.
[27:10.140 --> 27:13.220]  I don't have the schooling to really talk about this sort of stuff.
[27:13.220 --> 27:14.260]  I could teach you about plants.
[27:14.260 --> 27:16.740]  I could spot a deficiency from across the room.
[27:16.740 --> 27:22.060]  I can tell you which branch needs to be trellised a little bit more from across a fucking 75
[27:22.060 --> 27:27.380]  foot grow space, but this is not really my area of expertise.
[27:27.420 --> 27:29.340]  I don't want to talk too much out my ass.
[27:29.340 --> 27:34.300]  In my opinion though, I think that this would take more generations of breeding.
[27:34.300 --> 27:41.420]  If I bred a sub-cool strain and a, let's pick somebody else, a DNA genetic strain, sub-cool
[27:41.420 --> 27:42.860]  bred in super soil.
[27:42.860 --> 27:44.820]  I don't know what DNA genetics bred in.
[27:44.820 --> 27:47.260]  We've got super soil on one side.
[27:47.260 --> 27:51.420]  We're just going to say that, I'm just making this up, I don't know what they did, the DNA
[27:51.420 --> 27:52.500]  genetics bred in cocoa.
[27:52.500 --> 27:53.500]  They're advanced guys.
[27:53.500 --> 27:54.500]  They're hip cats.
[27:54.500 --> 27:56.300]  They probably did breed in cocoa.
[27:56.300 --> 28:00.640]  Now we got one guy breeding in super soil, one guy breeding in cocoa.
[28:00.640 --> 28:04.020]  We got seeds that came from super soil, seeds that came from cocoa.
[28:04.020 --> 28:05.020]  I grew those.
[28:05.020 --> 28:06.020]  I selected plants.
[28:06.020 --> 28:08.580]  Now I'm breeding those in a soilless mix.
[28:08.580 --> 28:11.940]  They've come from three different environments to tell you the truth already.
[28:11.940 --> 28:16.300]  Plus, like I said before, what did whoever sub-cool got his seeds from or whatever, what
[28:16.300 --> 28:18.740]  were they bred from?
[28:18.740 --> 28:24.940]  I don't think my one step is going to do enough evolutionary epigenetic, evolutionary change
[28:25.020 --> 28:29.580]  to really make any decision on if there will be a difference on future grows in different
[28:29.580 --> 28:30.580]  media.
[28:30.580 --> 28:34.460]  That was a really long way to say that, but I had a lot to say and it's my podcast.
[28:34.460 --> 28:35.980]  All right, there is more to this.
[28:35.980 --> 28:38.340]  It says, is this genetic drift?
[28:38.340 --> 28:39.340]  Let me think about that.
[28:39.340 --> 28:42.620]  No, I don't think that is the definition of genetic drift.
[28:42.620 --> 28:46.820]  I've defined genetic drift on another episode and that is not what it is.
[28:46.820 --> 28:49.660]  It says, I hope this makes sense and is not a stupid question.
[28:49.660 --> 28:51.700]  No, not a stupid question at all.
[28:51.700 --> 28:52.700]  Great question.
[28:52.700 --> 28:54.900]  I wish I had more information for you.
[28:54.900 --> 28:56.820]  I wish I could answer this more thoroughly.
[28:56.820 --> 29:02.100]  I'm sure in the comment section on YouTube, somebody will chime in with some brilliant
[29:02.100 --> 29:03.420]  shit about this.
[29:03.420 --> 29:07.820]  Anytime I am a little bit lost or make a little bit of a mistake, there are a lot of brilliant
[29:07.820 --> 29:13.060]  friends of mine that gently and politely remind me and update me and give me information.
[29:13.060 --> 29:19.940]  They educate me, which is, I do not feel any shame in being educated, updated, enlightened.
[29:19.940 --> 29:21.140]  Excuse me.
[29:21.140 --> 29:23.140]  They will share all kinds of great information with us.
[29:23.300 --> 29:28.460]  Check out the YouTube comments and somebody will have more to say about this, I'm sure.
[29:28.460 --> 29:32.780]  Also while I'm thinking about it, shout out to my friend F1P for the great update on F1
[29:32.780 --> 29:33.780]  crosses.
[29:33.780 --> 29:34.780]  Good information there.
