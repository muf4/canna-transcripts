[01:39.010 --> 01:40.770]  What's up, brother? What's up, man?
[01:40.770 --> 01:42.050]  Doing well, man. Thanks for coming.
[01:42.050 --> 01:44.050]  Yeah, for sure, man. Appreciate y'all having me.
[01:44.050 --> 01:47.130]  Oh, for sure. And Frosty brought a good friend, a new friend, somebody that I feel like I've
[01:47.130 --> 01:50.610]  known because I've been following him on social media. Dr. Piff is at the table. Thanks for
[01:50.610 --> 01:51.610]  joining me, bro.
[01:51.610 --> 01:52.610]  Appreciate you having me, Jeff.
[01:52.610 --> 01:54.690]  Man, thanks for coming. I'm going to push this mic just a little bit to your face. You're
[01:54.690 --> 01:57.290]  going to have to eat that a little bit to be heard. You've got kind of a low voice.
[01:57.290 --> 02:00.050]  You seem a little shy. We're going to break you of that. We're going to get you welcome
[02:00.050 --> 02:02.330]  and comfortable here. Welcome to the show, you guys. Thanks for joining me.
[02:02.330 --> 02:03.330]  Yeah, for sure, man.
[02:03.330 --> 02:06.610]  You guys, make sure you go follow my friends. Frosty, tell everybody your Instagram handle
[02:06.610 --> 02:07.770]  so they can follow you.
[02:07.770 --> 02:13.090]  It's Frosty Organics. Just all, you know, together. Just Frosty Organics.
[02:13.090 --> 02:15.930]  Go find him, you guys. Dr. Piff, how do we find you on the social media?
[02:15.930 --> 02:20.410]  Yeah, that's Dr. Piff. It's Dr. underscore Piff.
[02:20.410 --> 02:22.970]  Go check him out, you guys. I was looking at his pics. Everyone's got some great pics
[02:22.970 --> 02:27.770]  going on up here. So, of course, if Frosty's here, we're going to talk about No Till.
[02:27.770 --> 02:28.770]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28.770 --> 02:31.730]  Yeah, we're going to get right into it because we've been chatting it up for quite a while
[02:31.730 --> 02:34.370]  here. I can tell everybody's fired up and ready to get into podcasting. I'm going to
[02:34.370 --> 02:37.850]  drop this music out. We're going to get it on. Before we do that, I like to tell everybody
[02:37.850 --> 02:43.130]  what we're smoking on. I forgot that part. Is this the Sunset Sherb that you guys rolled?
[02:43.130 --> 02:44.130]  Sunset Sherb.
[02:44.130 --> 02:47.250]  This is some delicious flower. Yes, you guys, I am smoking flowers. You will hear it in
[02:47.250 --> 02:48.730]  my throat and in my voice tonight.
[02:48.730 --> 02:50.730]  We got jam on the flowers.
[02:50.730 --> 02:53.490]  Yeah, it's so delicious. He cracked open that jar and I was like, yeah, I'm going to smoke
[02:53.490 --> 02:57.130]  that other joint. They smoked one joint with me and it was good. What was that one?
[02:57.130 --> 02:58.130]  Same thing.
[02:58.130 --> 03:00.610]  Same thing. Okay, sure. And then when he cracked open that jar, I was like, I'm smoking this
[03:00.610 --> 03:04.490]  joint. When you rolled it, it was so delicious. Which one of you guys grew that?
[03:04.490 --> 03:10.970]  Oh, no, this is from a place, Clearwater Buds. It's just a wholesale around here. We actually,
[03:10.970 --> 03:11.970]  you know, just yeah.
[03:11.970 --> 03:14.490]  Good flower. They did a damn good job with that. Thanks for bringing the Sunset Sherb
[03:14.490 --> 03:18.570]  to the house. The house is going to be all cloudy. Dr. Piff over here rolls middle finger
[03:18.570 --> 03:22.810]  size joints and they just puff them like it's nothing, you guys. And then I took dabs and
[03:22.810 --> 03:26.930]  they were like, we're just going to enjoy the aroma in the air from your dabs. You guys
[03:26.930 --> 03:27.930]  don't smoke VHO, huh?
[03:28.250 --> 03:31.530]  Nah, no VHO. You know, I'll do the solventless and stuff like that. We've been smoking some
[03:31.530 --> 03:39.850]  really good rosin. We like to smoke a little bit of the dab logic or, you know, the oleo.
[03:39.850 --> 03:43.450]  They got some good stuff. You got to get their extractors choice though to get like the,
[03:43.450 --> 03:46.170]  you know, the therapy shit, but they got some good shit.
[03:46.170 --> 03:50.730]  Yeah, Colorado is definitely on top of it, whether it's VHO or solventless. We definitely
[03:50.730 --> 03:52.730]  got some of them Premier stuff.
[03:52.730 --> 03:56.870]  17 Lab is killing it too, but it's too hard to find it right now. You know, it's just
[03:56.870 --> 03:57.870]  all in the recreational market.
[03:57.870 --> 04:00.870]  Oh yeah. Okay. They got to get on the med side where it's affordable.
[04:00.870 --> 04:01.950]  Yeah, on medical, you know.
[04:01.950 --> 04:06.510]  So is the no butane and no VHO thing just kind of a personal choice? Because we were
[04:06.510 --> 04:09.630]  talking about diet and stuff earlier. I just kind of want to wrap it back around to that.
[04:09.630 --> 04:12.510]  Yeah, it makes me feel better and stuff too. You know, when I was smoking it every day
[04:12.510 --> 04:15.830]  and stuff like that, sometimes I would, you know, sometimes feel like pressure and stuff
[04:15.830 --> 04:18.950]  like that at certain times. Like, you know, not all the time, but I would almost get like
[04:18.950 --> 04:22.870]  a headache every once in a while and stuff like that. But I can just, you know, not smoking
[04:22.870 --> 04:25.950]  no VHO. I can really tell that, you know, it's just, it's better for me.
[04:25.950 --> 04:26.950]  So it wasn't good for you. Okay.
[04:26.950 --> 04:27.950]  Personally.
[04:27.950 --> 04:31.470]  All right. Yeah. I don't smoke a lot of flour because you can hear it right here in my throat.
[04:31.470 --> 04:34.830]  That's from that joint that I smoked and it makes my eyes feel itchy for some reason.
[04:34.830 --> 04:38.270]  I don't know about itchy, but it does something different to my eyes. And that's the only
[04:38.270 --> 04:42.210]  part about it that I would take out and dabs doesn't give me that part. I haven't noticed
[04:42.210 --> 04:45.550]  any negative effects from the dabbing yet. If you guys notice, point them out to me.
[04:45.550 --> 04:46.550]  Yeah.
[04:46.550 --> 04:48.630]  Because if it's me, you know what I mean? I'm not going to, maybe I won't notice.
[04:48.630 --> 04:52.750]  Nah, yeah, for sure. I think you, I think you like it too, just because you're a, you
[04:52.750 --> 04:55.750]  know, you're a quick guy. You like to get things done and stuff like that. So you just
[04:55.750 --> 04:56.750]  get high real quick, you know,
[04:56.750 --> 04:59.750]  I don't have to sit here and smoke four joints to get where I want to be.
[04:59.750 --> 05:04.350]  Yeah, not roll up or any of that. You just, you know, hit up your nail or turn on your,
[05:04.350 --> 05:05.350]  turn on your email. You're good.
[05:05.350 --> 05:06.350]  Yeah.
[05:06.350 --> 05:07.350]  Yeah. All right.
[05:07.350 --> 05:09.910]  So what would you dab if it were up to you?
[05:09.910 --> 05:14.710]  I'm more of a rosin guy. I don't even really, I mean, freshly pressed, freshly pressed
[05:14.710 --> 05:19.070]  melts nice every now and then, you know, but, uh, I'm more of a rosin guy. It's just crazy
[05:19.070 --> 05:25.550]  when you can get a, the turps that you can get from BHO and really quality rosin. It's
[05:25.550 --> 05:30.790]  just a, it's really credit to the grower. You know what I mean? Cause, um, those turps
[05:30.790 --> 05:36.350]  can't, they can't really be captured unless the cannabis was quality enough to, to, um,
[05:36.350 --> 05:41.470]  to do it in solventless. That's the difference between, um, you know, doing BHO and solventless
[05:41.470 --> 05:46.670]  is, is you can take some all right stuff with BHO and turn it into a really quality looking
[05:46.670 --> 05:47.670]  product.
[05:47.670 --> 05:48.670]  Yeah.
[05:49.270 --> 05:50.270]  Yeah.
[05:50.270 --> 05:52.270]  And then solventless is very hard. It's very rare that you see something like that happen.
[05:52.270 --> 05:56.270]  You take some really quality of cannabis to, to make a super premium product.
[05:56.270 --> 06:01.550]  Okay. That makes more sense to me. Uh, I like smoking rosin that was made from bubble hash.
[06:01.550 --> 06:05.470]  Otherwise I have never had rosin made straight from flour that I appreciated.
[06:05.470 --> 06:06.470]  Yeah, no, definitely.
[06:06.470 --> 06:08.950]  Okay. You guys gave me that ugh face. All right.
[06:08.950 --> 06:09.950]  No flour rosin.
[06:09.950 --> 06:10.950]  I thought it was definitely.
[06:10.950 --> 06:15.470]  No, it's, it's a hash rosin and you're just a, you're already, there's people who isolate
[06:15.470 --> 06:21.070]  the turps in, in a, in a ice wax and a full melt. It's already premier. So when you, um,
[06:21.070 --> 06:25.670]  when you take away what's not melted and you leave it in a freshly pressed rosin or, or
[06:25.670 --> 06:30.310]  just rosin fresh frozen or whatever the case may be, you just have such a premier product.
[06:30.310 --> 06:35.350]  It's a, I don't know, to be able to compare it to something like BHO and, and not, uh,
[06:35.350 --> 06:42.430]  have a carbohydrate, um, extract is it's, it's just, I don't know. It's just, it's really
[06:42.430 --> 06:46.390]  nice to have the peace of mind in the back of your mind that there was nothing, no butane
[06:46.390 --> 06:52.030]  ran over the plant that you took your 60 day harvest to, to grow. You know what I mean?
[06:52.030 --> 06:57.270]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Instead of just washing it. I've seen my friends watch my wife. I've
[06:57.270 --> 07:00.150]  watched my friend's faces when I've said, yeah. And then you just blow butane over and
[07:00.150 --> 07:03.150]  turn it into hash. And they're like, what? I grew this for so long.
[07:03.150 --> 07:07.790]  No, don't get me wrong. There's people that do butane. Uh, they're, they're real artists
[07:07.790 --> 07:12.390]  that know what they're doing. That can explain to you step-by-step what's really going on.
[07:12.550 --> 07:16.830]  I think there's so many people out there pretending that they know what's going on. There's, there's,
[07:16.830 --> 07:17.590]  there's a difference.
[07:17.590 --> 07:19.630]  There's good extracts and there's bad extracts.
[07:19.630 --> 07:23.510]  And there are good extractors and bad extractors, just like all things. Yeah. Okay. All right.
[07:23.510 --> 07:28.030]  So extractor is not a derogatory term anymore. I'm just kidding. Uh, do you guys smoke the,
[07:28.030 --> 07:30.590]  uh, the high cannabinoid or high terpene extracts?
[07:31.230 --> 07:33.550]  Um, you know.
[07:34.230 --> 07:34.630]  Okay.
[07:34.670 --> 07:39.190]  I can't, I can't say we don't, we, we, we haven't been smoking BHO for, I would say
[07:39.430 --> 07:44.630]  over half a year now, but what we have had our garden ran into a full,
[07:44.670 --> 07:48.990]  full spectrum extract. And, uh, I mean, it's not like we didn't try it or anything.
[07:49.190 --> 07:53.710]  It came out premier and stuff. It's a quality in quality out, but it's just,
[07:53.750 --> 07:57.030]  it's just a choice thing at this point. It's like, um,
[07:58.110 --> 08:01.350]  we're already growing clean cannabis. So it's like, we,
[08:01.350 --> 08:03.910]  we rather just stay on a solventless lifestyle.
[08:03.950 --> 08:06.830]  Makes perfect sense to me. Keep it clean. Don't put anything else in there.
[08:06.910 --> 08:09.190]  Facts. All right. I like it. I like it.
[08:10.630 --> 08:12.070]  I'm going to quit coughing pretty soon. You guys,
[08:12.070 --> 08:14.950]  I'm going to quit hitting that joint and I'll get, I'll get my voice together.
[08:15.310 --> 08:20.390]  Uh, let's see. You guys want to jump right into no till. Um, so no till no till,
[08:21.110 --> 08:22.070]  uh, to the best of my knowledge.
[08:22.070 --> 08:24.390]  And I know we've done an episode a long time ago and I feel like I may have
[08:24.390 --> 08:27.710]  learned a little bit. You start a pot with a conditioned soil,
[08:27.910 --> 08:31.630]  with a very amended soil. Then you let that soil come to life.
[08:32.070 --> 08:34.070]  Are there worms in that soil? Yeah. Okay.
[08:34.110 --> 08:35.670]  So you got worms and a lot of ingredients.
[08:35.670 --> 08:39.270]  We'll talk about the ingredients next. You got a pot filled with, uh,
[08:39.310 --> 08:42.870]  amendments, uh, lots of things, worms, and it comes alive.
[08:42.910 --> 08:43.990]  Then you plant your plant in there.
[08:44.390 --> 08:48.150]  Then your plant grows and you only have to feed it water. Is that correct?
[08:48.150 --> 08:51.070]  Because everything's already in the soil. You can add teas by the look on your
[08:51.070 --> 08:54.670]  face. I mean, you can do teas and stuff like that. So see the very first time,
[08:54.670 --> 08:58.550]  like, um, you gotta get the decomposition to, uh,
[08:59.630 --> 09:02.910]  be going quick enough to be feeding the plant correctly. Okay.
[09:02.910 --> 09:06.830]  So all those things I mixed in have to get broken down and start becoming bio
[09:06.830 --> 09:09.630]  available for my plant over time. How does that, how long does that take?
[09:09.630 --> 09:12.870]  30, 60 days? You know, I would, I would say the first round,
[09:12.870 --> 09:15.070]  the first round, you gotta just be doing a whole lot of things.
[09:15.070 --> 09:18.750]  You gotta be doing like a, you know, do a lot of Bocashi and stuff like that.
[09:18.750 --> 09:22.270]  Top dress a lot of Bocashi, you know, speed up that, that process.
[09:22.270 --> 09:25.470]  Stuff like that. Also the, yeah, the worms will like, and stuff like that.
[09:25.550 --> 09:28.910]  Feed a lot of, uh, uh, malted barley and stuff like that. You know,
[09:28.950 --> 09:32.790]  just grind up a whole bunch of two row, multiple, multiple barley. And, uh,
[09:32.950 --> 09:34.270]  you know, just top dress that a lot.
[09:34.550 --> 09:36.510]  You'll see your worms come to the top and I think, uh,
[09:36.710 --> 09:40.630]  just them coming up and mulching so much, it was just, you know, speed it up,
[09:40.630 --> 09:43.510]  speed it up, speed it up. And then the more you speed it up,
[09:43.510 --> 09:48.750]  then I think after that, now, you know, I got pots that are probably on 14,
[09:48.830 --> 09:52.310]  you know, 15 rounds or something like that. So in those pots,
[09:52.470 --> 09:54.350]  I am only feeding water and stuff like that. You know,
[09:54.350 --> 09:58.990]  I do a few top dressings just like, uh, you know, earthworm castings, you know,
[09:58.990 --> 10:02.510]  I do a few malted barleys. Um, but really nothing.
[10:02.510 --> 10:06.710]  It's just like after I pull the plants out, um, you know, I just pull like the,
[10:06.990 --> 10:10.030]  you know, the root ball out just cause I'm in like 10 and 15 gallons right now.
[10:10.070 --> 10:14.190]  In the future when I have more space, I'll do beds. Okay. Beds are better.
[10:14.750 --> 10:18.190]  I'll leave the, uh, the stock and the, and the root ball and stuff like that.
[10:18.230 --> 10:21.430]  And I'll let it just decompose. Oh, nice. I'll just plant right next to it.
[10:21.790 --> 10:24.150]  Okay. But right now I'm having to pull out, you know,
[10:24.190 --> 10:27.670]  the little bitty root ball by the time I pull it out though. Um,
[10:27.910 --> 10:31.790]  I leave it in there a few days. I top dress Bocashi. Um, I feed it.
[10:31.830 --> 10:34.510]  The worms will come eat, you know, what they need to and stuff like that.
[10:34.510 --> 10:37.230]  The beneficials will break down the roots and stuff like that for food and stuff
[10:37.230 --> 10:40.550]  like that. It'll speed it up. And like, after like five or seven days,
[10:40.710 --> 10:43.950]  then we'll pull them out, you know, I'll pull it out. And then I'll, uh,
[10:44.070 --> 10:47.870]  I'll plan in a, either a cup. It'll be from a cup or a one gallon.
[10:48.030 --> 10:50.710]  So we're not really disturbing the soil at all. You know, maybe, uh,
[10:50.830 --> 10:55.030]  the top layer a little bit, maybe a fist size section. Yeah. All right.
[10:55.550 --> 10:57.750]  Keeping everything just going on and stuff like that, that,
[10:57.910 --> 11:00.990]  that ecosystem's just rocking dude. Like, I mean,
[11:00.990 --> 11:04.590]  if you just saw how much like beneficials I have going in my pots, I mean,
[11:04.590 --> 11:05.550]  it's insane, dude.
[11:05.790 --> 11:08.510]  You put something in there and it decomposes so quick and it's just being
[11:08.510 --> 11:11.270]  broken down so quick. You're like, this is insane. You know?
[11:11.310 --> 11:14.590]  So if I threw, excuse me, what would you throw on top to, uh,
[11:14.630 --> 11:16.870]  what would you throw in top to let it decompose right now?
[11:17.830 --> 11:21.750]  Um, right now, um, we don't really need to throw anything on top right now.
[11:21.750 --> 11:25.510]  Like, uh, just because I'm so far in flower on a, you know, on,
[11:25.550 --> 11:28.310]  on the section that I'm doing right now, the right section though,
[11:28.310 --> 11:31.310]  I would top dress. I just threw it into flower. So it's on like, uh,
[11:31.350 --> 11:34.270]  five days into flower. So on that one, you know, top dress some,
[11:34.270 --> 11:37.430]  some Neiman kelp just to get a whole bunch of good, you know, uh,
[11:37.470 --> 11:42.030]  minerals and stuff like that. But what I, what I've been feeding even, you know,
[11:42.030 --> 11:46.510]  right whenever I get into a flower or even in a veg and stuff like that is I've
[11:46.510 --> 11:50.710]  been feeding insect fries has like every micro macro nutrient like available to
[11:50.710 --> 11:53.870]  Sean talks a lot about insect brass also. I mean, it's like two, two, two,
[11:53.910 --> 11:57.230]  like it's everything do. So like you feed it to your plan.
[11:57.230 --> 11:59.150]  You see him just like going ham, you know,
[11:59.150 --> 12:02.870]  you feed a few extra things with like some all low, you know, but really what,
[12:02.910 --> 12:05.110]  what I really feed, um,
[12:05.750 --> 12:09.990]  in a flower and stuff like that is what builds flowers for us. You know,
[12:09.990 --> 12:14.310]  not using any type of like synthetic, you know, things to, to build the flowers.
[12:14.310 --> 12:18.070]  What we're using is, is a potassium. Okay.
[12:18.150 --> 12:21.750]  Potassium is what builds a flower. All right. I mean, it'll banana peels. Oh,
[12:21.870 --> 12:23.190]  I mean, it'll throw these things huge.
[12:23.310 --> 12:27.150]  You can do a fermented fruit juices with bananas and stuff like that, you know?
[12:27.390 --> 12:30.430]  And so you can get it like a fermented fruit juice. It's just, you know,
[12:30.430 --> 12:31.550]  it's for men and stuff like that.
[12:31.550 --> 12:33.590]  So it's super strong and potassium and stuff like that.
[12:33.830 --> 12:36.750]  But what I've been doing is I just been using coconut water.
[12:36.990 --> 12:40.190]  If you look at coconut water, dude has so much potassium in it. It's crazy.
[12:40.230 --> 12:42.510]  Then it has all the gas has all kinds of coconut water.
[12:42.510 --> 12:45.830]  If you need it delivered guys. I mean, it's crazy. Yeah. Um,
[12:45.870 --> 12:47.350]  build a soul sells it, but you know,
[12:47.350 --> 12:49.110]  I feel like you can get other places and stuff like that.
[12:49.110 --> 12:51.350]  I like Jeremy and stuff like that. Like, uh, you know,
[12:51.590 --> 12:54.190]  no bad words about Jeremy and them. It's just, you know,
[12:54.190 --> 12:58.070]  I think you can get things cheaper and, uh, go elsewhere and stuff like that.
[12:58.110 --> 12:59.990]  I think in the beginning to use them and stuff like that,
[12:59.990 --> 13:02.030]  to buy some soil from them and they make things easy.
[13:02.030 --> 13:05.510]  So you don't have to mix your own soil. You know, that's, that's some good stuff.
[13:05.510 --> 13:07.790]  But, uh, other than that, you know, I would say just,
[13:07.790 --> 13:10.870]  just go where you can grow an aloe plant, you know? Yeah.
[13:11.030 --> 13:13.750]  Although so huge in a, in the no-till regimen,
[13:13.750 --> 13:16.950]  just because you want to just be feeding, you know, the, uh,
[13:16.990 --> 13:20.950]  the whole soil system and stuff like that. So you want to be just, you know,
[13:21.350 --> 13:23.310]  getting everything everywhere and stuff like that.
[13:23.630 --> 13:28.430]  I stopped using potassium silica, uh, just use a, just silica now.
[13:29.070 --> 13:31.910]  Um, it's pure silica is from rice holes made from rice holes.
[13:32.110 --> 13:35.550]  So I'm not getting potassium boost and stuff like that. So the only potassium,
[13:35.550 --> 13:38.910]  um, you know, feeding to the plants is the coconut that I'm, you know,
[13:38.910 --> 13:41.510]  using this stuff. Yeah. All right. But I mean, it's simple.
[13:41.510 --> 13:44.030]  If I stuck a carrot in one of your no-till pots right now,
[13:44.070 --> 13:48.830]  how long would it take for that carrot to be gone? Um, dude, it'd be quick, dude.
[13:48.830 --> 13:52.590]  I'd say three, four days. Wow. It would just eat that carrot up. I mean, quick.
[13:53.390 --> 13:56.830]  Um, the fungi, um, the fungus would overtake it. So quick too.
[13:56.830 --> 13:59.390]  I think mushrooms will start growing around and stuff. I mean, it's crazy.
[13:59.510 --> 14:02.830]  Get that white fur on it real quick. It disappear. Okay. It's amazing.
[14:02.830 --> 14:06.270]  Three days is fast. I mean, it's crazy, dude. That's awesome. It'll blow your mind.
[14:06.310 --> 14:08.030]  Yeah. I'd love to see it. How hot is it in there?
[14:08.030 --> 14:10.870]  If you stick your hand in that pot, how hot do you think it's real hot inside
[14:10.870 --> 14:14.950]  there? No, dude, it's cool. Like it's really cool. Like, uh, it's like, uh,
[14:15.230 --> 14:17.350]  you know, I would say it's, you know, not, not,
[14:17.510 --> 14:21.310]  not cold or nothing like that. It's just cool. It's like nice. And you know,
[14:21.310 --> 14:24.990]  it's always moist and stuff like that. Uh, the pots always stay, uh, you know,
[14:24.990 --> 14:26.750]  very moist. You know, I have,
[14:26.790 --> 14:29.990]  I have a few pots in there that I grow some even some vegetables and stuff like
[14:29.990 --> 14:33.190]  that. We throw some peppers and stuff in the pots and stuff like that, you know,
[14:33.270 --> 14:34.230]  harvest your, you know,
[14:34.230 --> 14:37.390]  your cannabis and be harvesting some peppers, eating some peppers and shit like
[14:37.390 --> 14:41.470]  that. Growing them all together. Make it as a cover crop. Yeah. I think, uh,
[14:41.470 --> 14:44.430]  I think pests hate that shit too. You know, it's a hot ass plant.
[14:44.670 --> 14:46.590]  They don't want to eat that shit. Like, you know, they're,
[14:46.590 --> 14:50.110]  they're fucking scramming, you know? So you just throwing good things up top.
[14:50.110 --> 14:53.470]  Like, you know, the cover crop that I usually plan is lemongrass. You know,
[14:53.790 --> 14:56.310]  we do some Clover and stuff like that. Cause you're trying to pull nitrogen.
[14:56.590 --> 14:58.710]  You're trying to pull nitrogen directly from the atmosphere.
[14:58.910 --> 15:00.550]  So the best thing to do is a cover crop. You have it,
[15:01.310 --> 15:02.910]  you have a good cover crop and stuff like that.
[15:02.910 --> 15:04.350]  And then you throw some mulch on there and you know,
[15:04.350 --> 15:05.910]  you need to throw some good mulch on there,
[15:05.910 --> 15:08.790]  but that cover crop will grow so quick. You know, you're throwing, you're,
[15:08.950 --> 15:10.470]  you're cutting that, throwing that on there.
[15:10.470 --> 15:11.910]  You're taking leaves off stuff like that.
[15:11.910 --> 15:15.270]  Your mulch is getting crazy and just so your defoliation that you do,
[15:15.270 --> 15:17.270]  the leaves you pull off, you just throw those in the pot also.
[15:17.270 --> 15:19.110]  Uh, yeah. Cause you don't have any trash.
[15:19.430 --> 15:21.270]  Yeah. I think how much food is in those leaves.
[15:21.310 --> 15:25.030]  Just nitrogen going right back into your plant. Oh, you're recycling bro.
[15:25.110 --> 15:29.750]  Is that cannibalism? All right. What else is in your cover crop, bro?
[15:29.750 --> 15:31.070]  Since you're going on about cover crop,
[15:31.070 --> 15:33.190]  I'm going to get as much info as I can about this cover crop.
[15:33.710 --> 15:37.830]  Um, the best thing to do is, uh, for sure is, is Clover and,
[15:37.870 --> 15:41.470]  and stuff like that is just, you know, crimson Clover and stuff like that. But,
[15:41.790 --> 15:45.230]  uh, you know, that's just going to pull like the most nitrogen and stuff like
[15:45.230 --> 15:47.670]  that. But other than that, you know, you throw some lemongrass in there, you know,
[15:47.830 --> 15:50.710]  you throw some good things like that. Throw a pepper plant, you know, throw some,
[15:50.750 --> 15:52.470]  throw some vegetables in there and stuff like that.
[15:52.750 --> 15:54.950]  I wouldn't really say a tomato or nothing like that,
[15:54.950 --> 15:56.710]  or like something that's going to pull a whole bunch of
[15:57.230 --> 15:59.470]  suck up all your nutrients to get too big. Yeah.
[15:59.550 --> 16:03.270]  Little alfalfa size type stuff. Yeah. Throw something simple. Okay. All right.
[16:04.190 --> 16:07.550]  When I'm building my, when you're building a no till pot, uh,
[16:07.550 --> 16:10.190]  what ingredients go into the pot to get you started?
[16:11.830 --> 16:14.510]  Well, so the ingredients to go in, I think, uh, you know,
[16:14.510 --> 16:18.430]  it's a pretty long process. So it's, um, you know, they're, they're using,
[16:18.550 --> 16:22.590]  it's basically, um, compost, like just for the most part,
[16:22.590 --> 16:26.310]  like just say for the most part, it's going to be compost. So, you know,
[16:26.310 --> 16:29.910]  like Malibu compost. Okay. Easy to find. Very easy to find you guys.
[16:29.910 --> 16:33.150]  Almost all your larger growth stores will have some Malibu compost for you.
[16:33.430 --> 16:38.390]  If not, they'll order it. Yeah. So Amazon has it. Compost earthworm castings,
[16:38.950 --> 16:42.870]  you know, um, that's going to be one part. And then there's going to be one part,
[16:42.890 --> 16:47.190]  you know, peat moss. Okay. And then it would be, uh,
[16:48.150 --> 16:51.910]  you know, I think, uh, what the other, uh, one part pumice, you know,
[16:52.790 --> 16:55.910]  you're making it real fluffy. Yeah. You know, I think, uh, you know,
[16:55.910 --> 16:59.110]  it's, it's real simple. It's, it's, it's just a simple recipe. And then,
[16:59.110 --> 17:01.390]  you know, it's just like a one,
[17:01.390 --> 17:04.430]  I think they're doing like one cup to every cubic foot. You know,
[17:04.550 --> 17:07.790]  whenever we were mixing it back in the day, I didn't mix it in so long. We,
[17:07.790 --> 17:10.830]  we were, we were buying it. Um, when I was running a,
[17:10.830 --> 17:13.030]  another house that I had going and stuff like that, you know,
[17:13.030 --> 17:14.710]  we're trying to follow laws and stuff like that, though.
[17:14.710 --> 17:17.590]  We all have plant counts and you know, we're doing our medical thing, but, uh,
[17:18.030 --> 17:21.710]  you know, I, I shut down a house that I had running and stuff like that. And,
[17:21.710 --> 17:24.110]  uh, you know, I was doing some, some good things over there,
[17:24.110 --> 17:27.590]  but I was able to just buy it from Jeremy, get things rocking so quick,
[17:27.590 --> 17:30.750]  just cause I know how to get this ecosystem going. You know,
[17:30.750 --> 17:33.310]  I didn't have to make the soil and have to wait fucking, you know,
[17:33.310 --> 17:34.990]  a few weeks or whatever, wait for it to, you know,
[17:35.030 --> 17:37.870]  cook and do its thing and stuff like that. You know, cause it's too hot.
[17:37.870 --> 17:40.790]  You get them hot pockets, be burning your plants and shit. You know,
[17:40.910 --> 17:43.150]  we were doing super soils back in the day and all that stuff is cool,
[17:43.150 --> 17:46.870]  but it's like, let's just use Jeremy now get this cheap ass soil. Yeah.
[17:46.950 --> 17:49.630]  You know, he's got a good setup over at build a soil. You guys, he doesn't pay us.
[17:49.630 --> 17:52.310]  We don't rep him, but build a soil is a good place to start for resources.
[17:52.310 --> 17:55.630]  Yeah. He's good. And so I just, you know, I just get that, that, um,
[17:55.710 --> 17:58.870]  I think it's like, uh, I get his, his cheapest one, dude.
[17:58.910 --> 18:00.750]  It's just like the cheapest soil that he has.
[18:00.750 --> 18:05.510]  I try to get the most basic one cause I'm going to top dress Karanja and name
[18:05.510 --> 18:08.350]  and kelp. And I'm going to top dress all these things. I don't, you know,
[18:08.350 --> 18:11.230]  I don't need him to put all these things in here. I'm a top dress, Bocashi.
[18:11.390 --> 18:15.390]  I'm a top dress, you know, uh, the best earthworm casting as possible.
[18:15.390 --> 18:16.790]  I got this guy named Don.
[18:17.070 --> 18:19.790]  I'm not going to tell y'all his actual company or nothing like that.
[18:19.790 --> 18:22.910]  Cause I've actually gave too many friends his number and he can't keep me loaded
[18:22.910 --> 18:26.230]  up. Sometimes I've done the same thing to myself before. Go shop here.
[18:26.230 --> 18:28.230]  And then you go to get it and all your friends bought it all.
[18:29.030 --> 18:33.910]  His own Verma, uh, compost, you know, company has his, his worm shit.
[18:34.030 --> 18:36.630]  You know, he's selling it for, for the load to me and stuff like that.
[18:36.630 --> 18:38.870]  But I can get 70 pounds for like 50 bucks, but you know,
[18:38.870 --> 18:41.870]  he hooks me up and when I get that and when I get a, you know,
[18:41.870 --> 18:43.550]  even when I get Malibu compost, you know,
[18:43.550 --> 18:46.310]  I order Malibu compost top dress with some Malibu compost. You know,
[18:46.310 --> 18:47.550]  we make teas and Malibu compost.
[18:47.550 --> 18:49.310]  But when I top dress with some Malibu compost,
[18:49.310 --> 18:51.470]  even every once in a while in some pots, you know,
[18:51.470 --> 18:54.110]  that needed after so many rounds and stuff like that,
[18:54.310 --> 18:57.310]  you see so many worms and so many beneficials and so much life in there.
[18:57.510 --> 19:00.110]  It's like, you know, just let me get this free life from, you know,
[19:00.110 --> 19:03.590]  California, wherever this came from. Now let me get this free life from Don,
[19:03.910 --> 19:07.190]  you know, and then all this, you know, free life is coming and stuff like that.
[19:07.190 --> 19:10.030]  Then I try and go into nature and go hiking and stuff like that.
[19:10.030 --> 19:11.870]  Come back, touch my plants and, you know,
[19:11.870 --> 19:14.230]  just try and bring nature and stuff in there. Bring, you know,
[19:14.230 --> 19:17.270]  any fun guy that's out there, you know, whatever, just try and, you know,
[19:17.590 --> 19:18.230]  bring it in there.
[19:18.230 --> 19:20.190]  You know, you know, I run large commercial grows, right?
[19:20.230 --> 19:23.870]  And you're talking about going out to nature and bring that into my grow.
[19:23.950 --> 19:26.670]  Yeah. You guys are on a different playing field than me.
[19:26.670 --> 19:30.630]  Yeah. I appreciate it. That's a different thing. So what happens is even,
[19:30.670 --> 19:33.230]  even right now I have some, uh, some plants that are, you know,
[19:33.230 --> 19:37.710]  getting pretty close to finishing and, uh, you know, they still price say, uh,
[19:37.790 --> 19:40.750]  they have like, you know, uh, you know, three weeks or something like that.
[19:41.230 --> 19:44.070]  And then, uh, we just brought some new plants in and stuff like that and threw
[19:44.070 --> 19:46.630]  them in a flower. And, you know, they had a few mites on them and stuff like that,
[19:46.630 --> 19:48.910]  just from, uh, you know, not being on my, uh,
[19:49.190 --> 19:50.950]  IPM sprays like I shouldn't stuff like that.
[19:50.950 --> 19:53.430]  And having little one gallons over here that, uh, you know,
[19:53.430 --> 19:55.350]  I get cuttings and stuff like that from friends.
[19:55.550 --> 19:57.430]  So they got a few spider mites and stuff like that on there.
[19:57.790 --> 20:00.310]  We take them in there and stuff like that. I mean,
[20:00.310 --> 20:02.070]  we don't even have to spray or nothing like that.
[20:02.070 --> 20:04.710]  The left side or nothing like that. Cause there's so far into flower. You know,
[20:04.710 --> 20:07.270]  if we spray anything, we spray something, you know, so organic, that wouldn't
[20:07.270 --> 20:11.950]  matter. I probably wouldn't spray oil after day 35. So if I spray anything,
[20:11.950 --> 20:16.350]  I'd spray, uh, um, you know, labs,
[20:16.430 --> 20:20.270]  lactobacillus spray something like that, that, uh, your plant would eat,
[20:20.310 --> 20:21.630]  your plant would use it and stuff like that.
[20:22.110 --> 20:23.950]  You just got to be kind of careful. You spray that too much.
[20:23.990 --> 20:27.030]  It'll raise the bricks levels in your soil so quick and stuff like that.
[20:27.030 --> 20:31.150]  You got to test the bricks levels in your soil. After you spray some fucking labs,
[20:31.150 --> 20:33.430]  you're like, you know, this is crazy, you know,
[20:33.750 --> 20:35.550]  but it just has so much sugar and so much, you know,
[20:35.550 --> 20:39.790]  beneficial and so much good shit to it. You know, your plant eats it though.
[20:39.830 --> 20:43.030]  Don't go too crazy with it. You can't overdo it. Yeah. You totally overdo it.
[20:43.070 --> 20:45.590]  Yeah, you can for sure. But yeah. So, you know,
[20:45.590 --> 20:48.430]  I would spray something like that or even spray like some hollow or some, you
[20:48.430 --> 20:51.150]  know, some coconut water or something like that. I wouldn't really say, you know,
[20:51.150 --> 20:54.630]  go spray an oil after day 35, but you wouldn't really need to.
[20:54.630 --> 20:57.550]  Like I'm saying, these plants are over here doing fine.
[20:57.870 --> 21:01.390]  These other plants have been in here over a week. They're clean now.
[21:02.070 --> 21:04.790]  I sprayed them a few times with an IPM that I, you know,
[21:04.810 --> 21:07.230]  normally doing stuff like that. But then naturally,
[21:07.430 --> 21:09.390]  I think the beneficials coming from the left side,
[21:09.410 --> 21:12.190]  coming to the right side and all that stuff. It's a good mixture. You know,
[21:12.190 --> 21:14.910]  let these mites come in here and play and get real scared and shit like that.
[21:14.910 --> 21:17.550]  And then they, you know, the beneficials come eat them all and shit like that.
[21:17.550 --> 21:20.590]  And then, you know, it's, it's taken care of. And then we're just, you know,
[21:20.990 --> 21:23.470]  sticking the land in we're like, let's make sure we get this.
[21:23.710 --> 21:28.510]  Something I've noticed. Uh, I've been introducing lace wings into my IPM mix.
[21:28.510 --> 21:31.350]  Nice. So I've got three different kinds of predator mites.
[21:31.430 --> 21:33.710]  I've got the hypoaspis in the dirt.
[21:33.710 --> 21:36.230]  I've got some other guys crawling around in the dirt I can't pronounce.
[21:36.550 --> 21:38.830]  And then I've been releasing lace wing eggs.
[21:39.110 --> 21:43.550]  Something I think the lace wings are doing is they heard the little bit of
[21:43.550 --> 21:47.230]  spider mites that couldn't get rid of are herded onto one plant onto one Cola.
[21:47.710 --> 21:51.830]  There's lace wings all around the room and they're like in a circle around this
[21:51.830 --> 21:52.670]  one table.
[21:52.830 --> 21:55.790]  And then there's another ring of them around this one plant and all the spider
[21:55.790 --> 21:57.470]  mites have congregated at this one plant.
[21:57.710 --> 22:01.030]  So I just cut that nug off and all the spider mites to feel like will be gone.
[22:01.030 --> 22:02.750]  And all the lace wings will be like, ha ha.
[22:03.070 --> 22:05.950]  But it was neat to come in and be like, I don't see any mites anywhere.
[22:06.110 --> 22:08.270]  Oh, they're right here. They were just on one Cola.
[22:08.350 --> 22:10.790]  I was like all the mites in the whole facility congregated here.
[22:10.790 --> 22:13.190]  I think all those fucking lace wings ate everybody else.
[22:13.550 --> 22:16.470]  And they're just gathering and they were going to have a feast on the leftovers.
[22:16.790 --> 22:19.910]  But they're gone now cut that Cola out and now there's just lace wings flying
[22:19.910 --> 22:20.790]  around looking for food.
[22:20.870 --> 22:21.230]  Yeah.
[22:21.510 --> 22:22.350]  They like herded them.
[22:22.390 --> 22:22.950]  It was pretty neat.
[22:23.070 --> 22:24.750]  And then no, eventually dying and stuff like that.
[22:24.750 --> 22:27.390]  You got to understand they're shitting in your pots and stuff like that too.
[22:27.590 --> 22:28.990]  And throwing insect frass in there.
[22:29.110 --> 22:29.510]  Yeah.
[22:29.550 --> 22:31.950]  Well, and they're breeding and making more eggs hopefully.
[22:32.030 --> 22:33.430]  And dying and shit like that.
[22:33.430 --> 22:33.790]  And yeah.
[22:33.790 --> 22:36.830]  And then, you know, whatever they're eating and stuff like that has a lot of
[22:36.830 --> 22:37.950]  nutrients and stuff like that.
[22:37.950 --> 22:39.110]  And it's crazy.
[22:39.110 --> 22:40.790]  They're going back into my pots and living for me.
[22:41.070 --> 22:42.390]  It's fun watching nature, huh?
[22:42.830 --> 22:43.190]  It is.
[22:43.270 --> 22:46.590]  I need to get more to, uh, buying some beneficials and stuff like that.
[22:46.590 --> 22:48.470]  Cause you know, I have some good ones.
[22:48.470 --> 22:50.150]  I see like, uh, what are those red mice?
[22:50.150 --> 22:51.350]  The real fast little red mice.
[22:51.350 --> 22:55.630]  I have a lot of those that come up and they, uh, they eat my, uh, if I have any
[22:55.630 --> 22:58.590]  mice, some spider mice, something like that, they eat all those, like I'll see
[22:58.590 --> 23:00.750]  them, I'll look on the bottom of my leaves.
[23:00.750 --> 23:02.070]  I'll have a bunch of those little red ones.
[23:02.070 --> 23:04.230]  Those are probably the persimmon lists or Swarovski.
[23:04.590 --> 23:05.110]  Yeah.
[23:05.190 --> 23:05.430]  Yeah.
[23:05.430 --> 23:07.910]  I've got a magazine in the other room with pictures of all of them and we'll
[23:07.910 --> 23:09.670]  go see which ones you've got and we'll identify them.
[23:09.870 --> 23:10.110]  Yeah.
[23:10.150 --> 23:10.230]  Yeah.
[23:10.230 --> 23:11.150]  We'll see what you got in there.
[23:11.190 --> 23:12.950]  Cause a lot of people pay money to order those.
[23:12.950 --> 23:14.950]  We buy them by the shit ton at the commercial girl.
[23:14.950 --> 23:17.310]  I get them in, they look like tea bags and you're hanging these little tea bags.
[23:17.310 --> 23:17.550]  Oh yeah.
[23:17.550 --> 23:18.790]  High post this mice and stuff.
[23:18.870 --> 23:19.270]  Uh, yeah.
[23:19.310 --> 23:19.470]  Yeah.
[23:19.470 --> 23:21.350]  We have those all in the soil, dude.
[23:21.470 --> 23:22.510]  I mean, they're everywhere.
[23:22.510 --> 23:25.310]  They'll come organically if you invite them a little bit up on the stock and
[23:25.310 --> 23:27.910]  stuff, but they don't really play in the leaves and stuff like that much.
[23:27.950 --> 23:28.470]  Not for me.
[23:28.470 --> 23:28.950]  I bet you they do.
[23:28.950 --> 23:29.670]  And the lights are off.
[23:29.870 --> 23:30.270]  Oh really?
[23:30.310 --> 23:30.470]  Yeah.
[23:30.470 --> 23:30.910]  They climb up.
[23:30.910 --> 23:31.870]  That's they hate light.
[23:31.910 --> 23:33.390]  So they climb up there and the lights go off.
[23:33.870 --> 23:34.230]  Okay.
[23:34.230 --> 23:36.510]  So you won't see during the day very much, but the lights go off.
[23:36.510 --> 23:37.190]  They go up there.
[23:37.630 --> 23:37.870]  Yeah.
[23:37.910 --> 23:39.430]  The California smites.
[23:39.790 --> 23:41.950]  Uh, we're reading that they may not like cannabis.
[23:42.550 --> 23:42.670]  Yeah.
[23:42.670 --> 23:45.630]  They may those, the ones that we release to eat the bugs.
[23:45.630 --> 23:49.710]  They may, they may just be running away is what we read, but we use them still.
[23:49.830 --> 23:50.230]  It's nice.
[23:50.270 --> 23:50.470]  Yeah.
[23:50.510 --> 23:50.990]  Not sure.
[23:51.150 --> 23:51.470]  Nice.
[23:51.630 --> 23:51.870]  All right.
[23:51.870 --> 23:52.670]  I need to get more into that.
[23:52.990 --> 23:53.190]  Yeah.
[23:53.190 --> 23:55.270]  Do you guys use bugs to take care of your problems?
[23:55.270 --> 23:58.310]  You listeners, because, uh, bugs are better than sprays and the bugs
[23:58.310 --> 23:59.790]  don't make your extracts taste like shit.
[23:59.790 --> 24:01.030]  The bugs won't make you sick.
[24:01.150 --> 24:01.430]  Yeah.
[24:01.510 --> 24:04.630]  Uh, once you cut down those plants and dry them and your buds start drying,
[24:04.670 --> 24:07.110]  the bugs are going to leave the predator mites you put on there.
[24:07.110 --> 24:07.590]  They're going to leave.
[24:07.630 --> 24:09.070]  They're going to go find food somewhere else.
[24:09.430 --> 24:12.390]  Those bugs are just like you when there's nothing to eat and nothing to
[24:12.390 --> 24:13.670]  fuck, they'll go somewhere else.
[24:13.710 --> 24:13.910]  Yeah.
[24:14.110 --> 24:14.310]  Yeah.
[24:14.510 --> 24:15.230]  That's yeah.
[24:15.470 --> 24:15.830]  Thanks.
[24:15.910 --> 24:16.230]  Fair.
[24:17.430 --> 24:17.950]  I'll tell you good.
[24:17.950 --> 24:18.510]  IPM though.
[24:18.510 --> 24:19.590]  That would keep everything away.
[24:19.590 --> 24:20.030]  I want to hear it.
[24:20.030 --> 24:21.390]  Cause that's one of the things I'm getting toward.
[24:21.950 --> 24:24.790]  Everybody wants to say that, you know, they get these crazy
[24:24.790 --> 24:26.510]  mites or these crazy shits.
[24:26.590 --> 24:28.910]  You know, Patrick goes to a few gardens that, you know, some of
[24:28.910 --> 24:30.310]  our buddies having stuff like that.
[24:30.590 --> 24:32.030]  You know, I'll go in people's gardens too, though.
[24:32.030 --> 24:34.950]  I'm not scared, you know, I'll bring whatever they have back, you know, fuck it.
[24:35.870 --> 24:38.950]  Um, anyways, you know, Patrick, go see some shit and he's like, dude,
[24:38.950 --> 24:40.910]  this is crazy, whatever they have over here, something like that.
[24:41.630 --> 24:41.790]  Yeah.
[24:42.550 --> 24:45.230]  I don't get to see these, these crazy things, stuff like that.
[24:45.230 --> 24:47.630]  I just haven't been able to see them just like having such a, you know, a
[24:47.630 --> 24:49.270]  healthy ecosystem and stuff like that.
[24:49.710 --> 24:53.190]  But the IPM that I do that I think will even keep everything away.
[24:53.190 --> 24:56.910]  The reason why they're not jumping on this left side is because, you know, till
[24:56.910 --> 25:01.590]  day 21 or till, you know, day 28 or whatever like that I'm over here spraying.
[25:02.430 --> 25:03.390]  I mean, it's real simple.
[25:03.510 --> 25:05.110]  They say two to one though.
[25:05.350 --> 25:09.750]  Name Karanja is better than name or Karanja by themselves.
[25:09.910 --> 25:10.310]  Okay.
[25:10.550 --> 25:14.550]  So if you're going to spray a tablespoon per gallon per se, all right.
[25:14.630 --> 25:19.150]  Um, you would do a two teaspoons of name, one teaspoon of Karanja.
[25:19.310 --> 25:19.630]  All right.
[25:20.110 --> 25:21.350]  Um, you're going to do that per gallon.
[25:21.550 --> 25:25.470]  Um, then after that, I would do like a half ounce of, uh, essential oils
[25:25.470 --> 25:27.030]  that you can get from build a soul.
[25:27.470 --> 25:28.150]  They're pretty cheap.
[25:28.830 --> 25:30.950]  Um, the essential oils are, they're, they're pretty good.
[25:31.030 --> 25:31.270]  Yeah.
[25:31.390 --> 25:32.070]  The essential oils.
[25:32.190 --> 25:34.550]  So you do a half ounce of, uh, essential oils per gallon.
[25:35.190 --> 25:38.950]  And then you would do, um, what else would you do after that?
[25:38.950 --> 25:44.510]  You would do, uh, you know, I guess, uh, one eighth teaspoon of, uh, you know, uh,
[25:44.910 --> 25:47.830]  silica just to keep it real nice.
[25:47.910 --> 25:48.270]  Okay.
[25:48.550 --> 25:49.510]  And then a little bit of aloe.
[25:50.750 --> 25:51.350]  That's real easy.
[25:51.790 --> 25:52.270]  That's simple.
[25:52.350 --> 25:53.790]  And the aloe is going to get it juicy.
[25:53.910 --> 25:56.870]  The silica is going to be good for the plants and everything else is going to
[25:56.870 --> 25:58.550]  make bugs wish they weren't fucking there.
[25:58.710 --> 26:01.790]  If you want to feed a little bit of a extra, you know, nutrients and stuff
[26:01.790 --> 26:04.230]  like that to the plants while you're doing it early in flower and stuff like
[26:04.270 --> 26:07.950]  that, I would say, uh, feed some full power in there too, you know, some, uh,
[26:07.950 --> 26:13.350]  humic acid, but yeah, go spray that three days in a row, spray three days in a row.
[26:13.670 --> 26:15.470]  You know, go in there and spray it all over your plants for three
[26:15.470 --> 26:16.510]  days, whenever the lights are off.
[26:17.030 --> 26:18.830]  I'm telling you, they're done.
[26:19.350 --> 26:19.790]  It's done.
[26:20.430 --> 26:21.790]  It's done after that three days.
[26:21.950 --> 26:23.150]  I hope you guys are all paying attention.
[26:23.230 --> 26:25.190]  A lot of people message me about how to get rid of mites.
[26:25.190 --> 26:27.350]  There's a completely organic way to do it.
[26:27.390 --> 26:29.550]  I'm not going to ask him to do it again, because I hope you're listening.
[26:29.550 --> 26:31.630]  You may have to use that 30 second back button.
[26:32.110 --> 26:32.790]  They're done, dude.
[26:32.790 --> 26:36.590]  I'm telling you after you spray that, um, if you want to try another one, I mean,
[26:36.590 --> 26:40.510]  you can even do a one that we've really found out, you know, enzymes will really
[26:40.550 --> 26:45.430]  fuck up, you know, uh, uh, uh, a pest, you know, they're good for beneficials.
[26:46.350 --> 26:48.190]  But they're bad for pests and stuff like that.
[26:48.190 --> 26:51.070]  So, uh, I don't know if you've heard of a soap nuts.
[26:51.470 --> 26:51.750]  No.
[26:51.750 --> 26:53.030]  Tell me about soap nuts.
[26:53.150 --> 26:53.350]  Okay.
[26:53.350 --> 26:59.790]  So nuts, uh, so they have like 25,000, uh, or, or 250,000, I think
[26:59.790 --> 27:01.070]  PBMs or something like that.
[27:01.070 --> 27:07.870]  25,000, 250,000 PBMs or something of, uh, of, uh, an enzyme called, uh,
[27:08.750 --> 27:09.950]  what is the enzyme called?
[27:10.750 --> 27:15.310]  Um, let me think of what the enzyme is called, but it's, uh, it's, it's,
[27:15.310 --> 27:16.990]  it's super powerful and stuff like that.
[27:16.990 --> 27:19.750]  So you take these soap nuts and you can take these, uh, soap nuts and
[27:19.750 --> 27:22.670]  it's just like a little shell and, you know, they're broken up and you
[27:22.670 --> 27:25.590]  take, uh, you know, you take a few of them, grind them up and stuff like that.
[27:25.630 --> 27:30.030]  Put the powder in, uh, in the water and stuff like that and bubble it
[27:30.110 --> 27:31.590]  and watch how much it bubbles up.
[27:32.430 --> 27:33.510]  It's it's saponins.
[27:33.590 --> 27:34.190]  That's what it is.
[27:34.270 --> 27:35.590]  So the enzyme is saponins.
[27:35.590 --> 27:37.190]  So it's 25% saponins.
[27:37.190 --> 27:39.310]  This little nut is 25% saponins.
[27:39.550 --> 27:41.030]  So you gotta think how many saponins you get.
[27:41.430 --> 27:46.350]  So then you do two to one Karanjanine and then you do a saponins with it.
[27:46.510 --> 27:50.310]  You know, just that by itself, that shit will come out.
[27:50.310 --> 27:51.710]  You know, you spray it out of an automizer.
[27:51.710 --> 27:53.390]  If you've got a pretty big garden or something like that.
[27:53.390 --> 27:55.350]  I don't know if you spray it out of a normal spray or what it'll do,
[27:55.350 --> 27:57.310]  but you spray it out of an automizer and stuff like that.
[27:57.550 --> 27:59.910]  That shit will foam up like so much.
[27:59.910 --> 28:02.710]  It's like foam covering, like all your plants and stuff like that.
[28:03.110 --> 28:05.630]  Can't nothing live in that soap nuts.
[28:05.710 --> 28:06.950]  So you just take the soap nut water.
[28:06.950 --> 28:08.750]  You bubble the soap nuts for 24 hours.
[28:09.350 --> 28:10.270]  Take the soap nut water.
[28:10.830 --> 28:13.790]  It'll be real nice and bubbled up and stuff like it'll bubble up like crazy.
[28:13.790 --> 28:15.270]  The saponins will be going crazy.
[28:16.110 --> 28:18.110]  You take that water, you pour that water.
[28:18.910 --> 28:22.150]  Uh, you know, do it, do a gallon, do two gallons, whatever you want to do.
[28:22.550 --> 28:27.110]  And then, you know, do your, uh, name and Karanja with that and then put some, uh,
[28:27.230 --> 28:30.350]  you know, some silica in there if you want, but you don't really need it because
[28:30.710 --> 28:32.790]  everything's going to be nice and mixed up with those soap nuts.
[28:33.550 --> 28:34.190]  It's an enzyme.
[28:34.590 --> 28:35.590]  You know, it's going to mix everything up.
[28:35.630 --> 28:36.310]  It's crazy.
[28:36.310 --> 28:39.150]  It's just, I mean, that's two things and it'll just go crazy in there.
[28:39.350 --> 28:41.630]  Send me pictures of your process, making it next time.
[28:41.710 --> 28:41.830]  Yeah.
[28:41.830 --> 28:42.550]  I want to see how you do it.
[28:42.590 --> 28:42.990]  Yeah, for sure.
[28:43.790 --> 28:46.350]  And if you let me post them, we'll put them all where you guys check out frosty's
[28:46.350 --> 28:47.710]  Instagram and you can see how he does it.
[28:47.790 --> 28:48.990]  We'll put them up there so you can see it.
[28:49.070 --> 28:49.150]  Yeah.
[28:49.150 --> 28:50.310]  I'll put it on the listeners to learn.
[28:50.430 --> 28:50.590]  Yeah.
[28:50.830 --> 28:51.590]  You can do labs.
[28:51.710 --> 28:54.030]  I mean, there's, there's a million different things you can do organically
[28:54.030 --> 28:54.830]  and stuff like that.
[28:54.830 --> 28:56.830]  Um, you know, coconut water and stuff like that.
[28:57.030 --> 29:00.590]  Insect for us actually even kills bugs and stuff like that.
[29:01.350 --> 29:03.110]  Just too much nutrients, too much enzymes.
[29:03.110 --> 29:04.710]  They'll be thrown up everywhere and shit like that.
[29:05.430 --> 29:05.750]  All right.
[29:05.790 --> 29:07.430]  Just making the bugs sick to their stomach.
[29:07.510 --> 29:09.030]  They also like to just get away from it.
[29:09.150 --> 29:09.350]  Yeah.
[29:09.350 --> 29:10.310]  They like to get away from it.
[29:10.310 --> 29:11.270]  Cause it's just like worm.
[29:11.390 --> 29:13.150]  I mean, uh, bug shit and stuff like that.
[29:13.150 --> 29:14.670]  So like, Oh, there's some other bugs over here.
[29:14.670 --> 29:15.830]  And like, we got to get the fuck out of here.
[29:15.830 --> 29:16.070]  Yeah.
[29:16.270 --> 29:16.590]  All right.
[29:16.630 --> 29:18.670]  And then, then they see all those carcasses and they get scared and they're
[29:18.670 --> 29:22.670]  like, I don't want to be there in the, uh, the land, the landfill of dead bodies.
[29:22.790 --> 29:23.070]  It's interesting.
[29:23.070 --> 29:24.790]  It looks like Vlad the impaler has been around.
[29:24.990 --> 29:25.870]  It's pretty interesting.
[29:25.910 --> 29:26.230]  All right.
[29:26.550 --> 29:26.790]  All right.
[29:26.790 --> 29:28.030]  I just bought us a little bit more time there.
[29:28.030 --> 29:29.350]  If you saw me pushing buttons on the phone.
[29:30.030 --> 29:31.590]  Let's see, we've done cover crop.
[29:31.590 --> 29:31.870]  We've done.
[29:31.870 --> 29:34.510]  So what else are you doing for pest management when you were mixing up?
[29:34.750 --> 29:37.790]  Uh, we had Sean on the show a while back and he said to put the neem and
[29:37.790 --> 29:39.270]  the Karanja meal in the soil.
[29:39.470 --> 29:40.470]  Would you do that or no?
[29:40.990 --> 29:45.990]  Um, see, I put neem and Karanja meal in the, uh, in the soil for sure.
[29:46.030 --> 29:46.310]  Okay.
[29:46.350 --> 29:51.870]  Um, but the name and the Karanja oil is a little different, you know, I blend it up.
[29:51.870 --> 29:53.470]  So like, that's how I'm getting it.
[29:53.470 --> 29:57.630]  You know, I'm, I'm putting it in a small little container with, uh, some warm water
[29:57.630 --> 29:59.110]  and I'm, I'm blending all that stuff up.
[29:59.110 --> 30:00.750]  So it's getting really nice and mixed up.
[30:00.790 --> 30:03.390]  Turns to like a real nice, you know, white mixture.
[30:03.550 --> 30:07.230]  And then I'm pouring that into my water, into my few gallons and stuff like that.
[30:07.230 --> 30:09.590]  Just getting a real nice and mixed up and stuff like that with a blender and stuff
[30:09.590 --> 30:11.270]  like that, just doing my own show.
[30:11.270 --> 30:12.070]  Is it a little Ninja?
[30:12.510 --> 30:12.750]  Yeah.
[30:13.070 --> 30:13.310]  Yeah.
[30:14.030 --> 30:15.950]  You know, getting that thing all crazy.
[30:15.950 --> 30:16.190]  Yeah.
[30:16.390 --> 30:17.310]  But yeah, no, you can eat.
[30:17.350 --> 30:20.750]  I put Neiman, uh, Karanja mill, you know, Neiman Karanja cake.
[30:21.270 --> 30:22.030]  Uh, more or less.
[30:22.070 --> 30:26.670]  I'll put Neiman Karanja cake, uh, on, on as a top dressing for sure.
[30:26.750 --> 30:29.590]  And, uh, kelp and stuff like that.
[30:29.630 --> 30:31.510]  It builds the fun guy so quick.
[30:31.510 --> 30:33.750]  You'll just see like the mycelium just building like crazy.
[30:34.830 --> 30:37.950]  You know, by the time it gets into the white fur going, you guys, if you are
[30:37.950 --> 30:41.950]  growing organics or no-till or super soil, when you see that white fuzz, that's good.
[30:42.190 --> 30:42.630]  That's good.
[30:42.630 --> 30:42.750]  Yeah.
[30:42.750 --> 30:43.270]  Don't freak out.
[30:43.270 --> 30:44.630]  People like to be like, oh, it's moldy.
[30:44.630 --> 30:45.270]  I got to throw it away.
[30:45.270 --> 30:46.470]  No, that's what you're aiming for.
[30:46.790 --> 30:48.430]  That white powder is the start of life.
[30:48.830 --> 30:52.230]  If you got shit growing on the dirt, you're going to grow good shape from your dirt.
[30:52.270 --> 30:52.630]  Oh yeah.
[30:52.790 --> 30:53.030]  Yeah.
[30:53.190 --> 30:53.670]  Good shit.
[30:53.750 --> 30:53.950]  Yeah.
[30:53.950 --> 30:54.710]  People don't get scared.
[30:54.710 --> 30:56.990]  Or people don't understand what's happening and they get scared and
[30:56.990 --> 30:57.910]  then they throw their shit away.
[30:57.950 --> 30:59.110]  I've seen it happen a few times.
[30:59.550 --> 31:00.710]  I'm like, I had to throw that shit away.
[31:00.710 --> 31:03.870]  And I'm like, bro, you want to go dig through there, wherever their dirt is
[31:03.870 --> 31:05.630]  and get it like, I want that dirt, man.
[31:05.630 --> 31:06.470]  That shit was awesome.
[31:06.470 --> 31:07.630]  And you just tossed it all.
[31:08.830 --> 31:09.310]  All right.
[31:09.310 --> 31:13.550]  So what are some common problems that people are going to run into if they
[31:13.550 --> 31:14.830]  try to start a no till garden?
[31:14.830 --> 31:17.790]  What are the basic, like the first issues these guys are going to run into?
[31:18.310 --> 31:19.790]  I think trying to do too much.
[31:20.030 --> 31:21.790]  Um, a lot of people come in and.
[31:22.910 --> 31:26.310]  And if you've grown any other way, even if you haven't, it's just like,
[31:26.310 --> 31:29.270]  you're going to take pointers probably from people that have grown, you know,
[31:29.790 --> 31:33.110]  with bottles or even if they've grown organically with bottles or something
[31:33.110 --> 31:36.390]  like that, or super souls, you're constantly having to do something to the
[31:36.390 --> 31:40.110]  plants, constantly have to do something to the soil, leave them alone.
[31:40.270 --> 31:40.550]  Yeah.
[31:40.590 --> 31:42.630]  It's, this is kind of like what would happen.
[31:42.670 --> 31:45.470]  I always talk about how Cush came from a mountain in Afghanistan.
[31:45.470 --> 31:46.630]  They got pissed on by a goat.
[31:47.070 --> 31:48.110]  Uh, just leave it alone.
[31:48.230 --> 31:48.470]  Leave it.
[31:48.470 --> 31:49.390]  The goat will come piss on it.
[31:49.390 --> 31:50.110]  And it'll be just fine.
[31:50.110 --> 31:51.150]  Everything's in that soil.
[31:51.390 --> 31:53.590]  I do apologize for the little flyer bugs that are around.
[31:53.670 --> 31:54.390]  Uh, it's the season.
[31:54.390 --> 31:55.030]  They're everywhere.
[31:55.030 --> 31:55.790]  Right now.
[31:56.070 --> 31:56.390]  Yeah.
[31:56.430 --> 31:56.630]  Yeah.
[31:56.630 --> 31:57.630]  Well, right now they're extra strong.
[31:57.630 --> 32:00.150]  When you guys smoked that joint, those little bugs came flying around you.
[32:00.390 --> 32:02.190]  It means you have a lot of organic shit in here.
[32:02.390 --> 32:02.750]  All right.
[32:02.750 --> 32:03.430]  Well, that is true.
[32:03.590 --> 32:07.110]  There, there's a Bokashi bucket within sight, fruit and stuff like that.
[32:07.110 --> 32:07.510]  Yeah.
[32:07.630 --> 32:08.750]  I have these at my house too.
[32:08.830 --> 32:10.150]  They're everywhere right now in Pueblo.
[32:10.190 --> 32:11.510]  You go to a house without them.
[32:11.790 --> 32:12.150]  I don't know.
[32:12.150 --> 32:15.070]  They're frustrating when you're trying to dab and fly in your nose.
[32:15.990 --> 32:16.310]  Yeah.
[32:16.390 --> 32:17.230]  I was watching Mr.
[32:17.230 --> 32:17.750]  Piff, Dr.
[32:17.750 --> 32:19.190]  Piff over here, slap him out of the air.
[32:19.830 --> 32:22.070]  And we said your name a few times a couple of minutes ago, bro.
[32:22.070 --> 32:22.990]  I wrote down the times.
[32:22.990 --> 32:24.150]  Do we need to edit out your real name?
[32:24.630 --> 32:24.990]  All right.
[32:24.990 --> 32:26.990]  Cause I wrote it down just in case we needed to go cut you out.
[32:27.510 --> 32:30.110]  Our buddy Frosty got high and spilled the beans over here, man.
[32:30.710 --> 32:32.590]  Spilled the fucking beans on your name.
[32:32.670 --> 32:33.630]  I'm all clear.
[32:33.710 --> 32:34.070]  Cool.
[32:34.150 --> 32:34.430]  Cool.
[32:34.830 --> 32:36.190]  So they're going to try to do too much.
[32:36.670 --> 32:39.110]  So the easy way to solve that is just leave them alone.
[32:39.350 --> 32:40.190]  They're cannabis plants.
[32:40.350 --> 32:43.990]  If you want to do something, uh, do some super cropping, pop the stems a little bit.
[32:44.110 --> 32:44.870]  It happens in bed.
[32:44.870 --> 32:45.750]  You fully ate a little bit.
[32:45.750 --> 32:46.190]  Yeah.
[32:46.350 --> 32:50.030]  I see everybody like water too much or do something in veg and stuff like that.
[32:50.030 --> 32:52.870]  And then, you know, it just, uh, it fucks their plants up and stuff like that.
[32:52.870 --> 32:56.670]  What you gotta do, you know, in veg and stuff like that water one time a week.
[32:57.430 --> 33:00.230]  And watch how moist and wet that soil is.
[33:00.470 --> 33:01.630]  You got mulch on top.
[33:01.630 --> 33:04.590]  You got, you know, it's just so much happening and stuff like that.
[33:04.830 --> 33:07.790]  I mean, at the, at the least you're going to have a 10 gallon pot, you know?
[33:07.910 --> 33:08.350]  Okay.
[33:08.430 --> 33:11.510]  But you know, I like to do 15 gallons, stuff like that right now.
[33:11.510 --> 33:14.710]  Um, the, the pots that I kept and stuff like that, we have more 15 gallons and we
[33:14.710 --> 33:19.590]  do tens, there's a lot of 15 gallons stuff in there and, uh, they're going hard, man.
[33:19.590 --> 33:22.950]  Like I'm telling you, dude, like you lift out the mulch and you see so much life, so
[33:22.950 --> 33:24.030]  many worms, shit like that.
[33:24.030 --> 33:25.350]  And I didn't buy worms.
[33:25.350 --> 33:27.270]  Like I didn't put these worms in there, you know?
[33:27.430 --> 33:27.550]  Yeah.
[33:27.550 --> 33:30.110]  What about keeping the life in the pots?
[33:30.230 --> 33:33.550]  What about people running into problems with their, their life, leaving the pot?
[33:34.550 --> 33:37.190]  Uh, I think again, you know, it's just people trying to do too much.
[33:37.190 --> 33:40.510]  People try and get in and want to do like these, these mega teas and shit like that.
[33:40.510 --> 33:43.670]  Like, I think the plant needs a lot, you know, they're trying to do like these,
[33:43.950 --> 33:46.270]  you know, Neiman kelp teas constantly and shit like that.
[33:46.270 --> 33:49.190]  And it's like, you know, I think you need to do Neiman kelp teas, you know, every
[33:49.190 --> 33:50.430]  once in a while and stuff like that.
[33:50.430 --> 33:54.070]  You need to do a few compost teas, but, uh, chill out, you know what I mean?
[33:54.430 --> 33:56.550]  Let these things breathe, let them do their thing.
[33:56.550 --> 33:57.710]  Let this ecosystem eat.
[33:57.830 --> 34:02.510]  How is someone going to know that the inside of that ecosystem has gone to shit?
[34:02.550 --> 34:03.590]  How are they going to be able to tell?
[34:04.350 --> 34:06.310]  I think your plan will just be having problems.
[34:06.310 --> 34:07.190]  It's not growing well.
[34:07.190 --> 34:08.550]  It'll be going deficient.
[34:08.790 --> 34:09.110]  Okay.
[34:09.150 --> 34:10.790]  You'll see yellowing, you'll see spots.
[34:10.790 --> 34:11.510]  It'll get crunchy.
[34:11.510 --> 34:12.350]  It'll get droopy.
[34:12.390 --> 34:13.310]  Stuff like that.
[34:13.310 --> 34:15.310]  Oh, what do we do for cow mag in this situation?
[34:15.790 --> 34:19.470]  See, you don't need calcium and, and, uh, magnesium and stuff like that.
[34:19.470 --> 34:23.550]  Uh, then the, the cow mag and stuff like that is coming from all, I guess the,
[34:23.550 --> 34:26.590]  uh, trace minerals and stuff like that come from the name and stuff like that.
[34:27.630 --> 34:28.470]  There's a lot of calcium.
[34:28.670 --> 34:29.830]  There's a lot of, uh, magnesium.
[34:29.830 --> 34:32.110]  There's a lot of trace minerals all through there and stuff like that.
[34:32.590 --> 34:35.790]  Um, I think this, I think we're getting a lot of different ways.
[34:35.790 --> 34:39.310]  I'd have to, uh, look more into where I am getting the calcium and the
[34:39.310 --> 34:43.630]  magnesium for my plants, but they're going hard, man, and they stay green.
[34:43.630 --> 34:45.950]  Uh, as long as they're doing it, I'm not going to ask
[34:45.950 --> 34:47.030]  questions if they look good.
[34:47.070 --> 34:47.590]  Yeah.
[34:47.750 --> 34:48.070]  All right.
[34:48.310 --> 34:50.230]  So you never see a cow mag deficiency at all?
[34:50.310 --> 34:51.790]  No, we don't see no deficiencies.
[34:51.790 --> 34:54.230]  Uh, the only thing I see is, you know, sometimes if a plant's like
[34:54.230 --> 34:56.750]  directly under a light, you know, sometimes it wants more food at once.
[34:57.270 --> 34:59.470]  But see, what I do is I don't do a lot of teas and stuff.
[34:59.470 --> 35:02.070]  Everybody wants to do a lot of teas to feed their soul and stuff like that.
[35:02.070 --> 35:05.030]  You know, what, what Patrick sees me doing, what Patrick helps me do is,
[35:05.670 --> 35:08.110]  we do a lot of, uh, top dressing and stuff like that.
[35:08.470 --> 35:09.910]  Let the ecosystem break it down.
[35:10.190 --> 35:14.070]  If you're trying to make a tea and bypass the ecosystem, the ecosystem
[35:14.070 --> 35:15.270]  is going to leave or go to sleep.
[35:15.270 --> 35:16.710]  What the fuck do they need to be there for?
[35:16.830 --> 35:17.110]  You know?
[35:17.270 --> 35:17.670]  All right.
[35:17.950 --> 35:20.430]  But if you're, if you're over here, you know, doing it correctly and
[35:20.430 --> 35:24.390]  saying, okay, let me figure out how much they need, how much each plant
[35:24.390 --> 35:28.470]  needs top dress them, but the ecosystem come see what that is.
[35:28.670 --> 35:29.430]  They're like, oh, nice.
[35:29.430 --> 35:30.110]  We like this.
[35:30.350 --> 35:33.670]  Then they break it down and they can use it correctly and stuff like that.
[35:33.910 --> 35:35.270]  They can break it down correctly.
[35:35.550 --> 35:36.830]  You know, quit trying to bypass them.
[35:37.030 --> 35:38.150]  You know, your ecosystem is going to die.
[35:38.150 --> 35:40.150]  What, what does your ecosystem need to be there for?
[35:40.270 --> 35:43.670]  If you're going to be the ecosystem, let it work itself.
[35:43.670 --> 35:44.430]  That's what you set up.
[35:44.430 --> 35:49.030]  No till pots for stop doing teas, stop doing all these teas and shit like that.
[35:49.070 --> 35:50.670]  All right, you guys, you heard it from Frosty.
[35:51.190 --> 35:52.190]  Frosty knows what he's saying.
[35:52.190 --> 35:53.990]  I've, I've seen his products.
[35:54.030 --> 35:54.350]  Yeah.
[35:54.390 --> 35:55.190]  Speaks for itself.
[35:55.190 --> 35:57.630]  Some of that gorilla glue used to grow a man was amazing.
[35:57.670 --> 35:58.030]  Oh yeah.
[35:58.110 --> 36:00.190]  I have some coming down here pretty soon.
[36:00.190 --> 36:01.230]  I'm gonna come bless you with some.
[36:01.230 --> 36:03.470]  I was going to say, we're going to have to do another show because I know this is
[36:03.470 --> 36:05.270]  going to spark questions from a lot of listeners.
[36:05.270 --> 36:06.830]  They're going to be like, well, that was a good warmup.
[36:07.030 --> 36:07.270]  Yeah.
[36:07.270 --> 36:09.270]  I want six or seven more shows out of that cat.
[36:09.270 --> 36:09.870]  So you'll be back.
[36:09.870 --> 36:11.350]  You guys are both welcome back all the time.
[36:11.430 --> 36:11.870]  Yeah, for sure.
[36:11.870 --> 36:12.470]  Appreciate it.
[36:12.470 --> 36:12.670]  Yeah.
[36:12.670 --> 36:13.150]  Come back.
[36:13.470 --> 36:15.630]  Uh, what is your area of expertise, my friend?
[36:15.630 --> 36:17.030]  I know this guy is the no till guy.
[36:17.070 --> 36:17.990]  What, what, what are you?
[36:18.870 --> 36:24.550]  So, um, I've been, um, I've been in contact with a lot of growers from a young age.
[36:24.550 --> 36:31.030]  And, uh, I just, I'm more of a, I would consider myself more of an agent and, uh,
[36:31.070 --> 36:33.870]  I like to represent people that, uh, I believe in.
[36:34.430 --> 36:39.270]  So before I really got into cannabis on the business end of the deal, I just
[36:39.270 --> 36:40.990]  really liked quality cannabis.
[36:41.110 --> 36:45.390]  Then no, um, exactly what made it super quality.
[36:45.870 --> 36:50.350]  But, um, I know there was a difference between your average pot and like some
[36:50.350 --> 36:51.110]  super chronic.
[36:51.670 --> 36:57.910]  So I always had this one for wanting to figure out who and how you ended up with
[36:58.030 --> 37:01.430]  super chronic weed versus just your average Joe pot.
[37:01.910 --> 37:06.190]  And, um, I've been blessed to be around and fortunate to be around the people
[37:06.190 --> 37:08.670]  that I've been, uh, enlightened by.
[37:08.710 --> 37:10.470]  So it's a, it's a blessing.
[37:11.190 --> 37:11.670]  Well, thank you.
[37:11.870 --> 37:13.350]  We're glad to have you here on the show.
[37:14.630 --> 37:16.310]  It seems like you're learning a lot from this guy too.
[37:16.590 --> 37:17.150]  Yeah, for sure.
[37:17.590 --> 37:18.910]  He's going to put you on the right path.
[37:18.950 --> 37:19.710]  I trust him with my girl.
[37:19.710 --> 37:21.750]  I like, I like, I like good vibes in the garden.
[37:21.830 --> 37:21.990]  Yeah.
[37:21.990 --> 37:22.870]  I know you're about that.
[37:22.870 --> 37:23.150]  Five.
[37:23.150 --> 37:23.310]  Yeah.
[37:23.310 --> 37:26.190]  The garden, the right people and the right movements in there.
[37:26.230 --> 37:26.470]  Yeah.
[37:26.470 --> 37:27.430]  You got to make things different.
[37:27.430 --> 37:28.630]  I want no negativity in the garden.
[37:28.630 --> 37:28.910]  Yeah.
[37:28.910 --> 37:29.150]  Yeah.
[37:29.150 --> 37:31.790]  Today I listened to spearhead in the garden all day just to keep it positive.
[37:31.790 --> 37:32.430]  It's moving.
[37:32.430 --> 37:32.710]  Yeah.
[37:32.910 --> 37:33.990]  Mike Franti and spearhead.
[37:34.030 --> 37:35.710]  Keep it crazy how much they love music, right?
[37:35.750 --> 37:36.110]  Oh yeah.
[37:36.110 --> 37:36.430]  Yeah.
[37:36.990 --> 37:38.030]  They feed off of you.
[37:38.150 --> 37:38.590]  They're there.
[37:38.590 --> 37:42.870]  They know if I try not to think about, uh, like if I have a meeting with the
[37:42.870 --> 37:45.510]  bosses or something, I won't go in the grove for a few minutes after that.
[37:45.510 --> 37:48.990]  I'll try to keep all the investors or owners or whoever out of those kinds of
[37:49.110 --> 37:51.710]  just keep them away from the plants a little bit and just, let's just go to one
[37:51.710 --> 37:53.630]  area and you can see the buds and then we're going to leave.
[37:53.670 --> 37:53.910]  Yeah.
[37:53.950 --> 37:56.710]  I don't need you coming in here and putting your Babylon all over my plants.
[37:56.710 --> 37:56.950]  You know?
[37:57.190 --> 37:58.230]  No, let them grow.
[37:58.390 --> 37:58.830]  Yeah.
[37:58.950 --> 37:59.430]  I try.
[37:59.470 --> 38:01.350]  Do you try and touch every single plant every day?
[38:01.390 --> 38:04.150]  Cause you know, I try and touch every single plant every single day.
[38:04.150 --> 38:06.270]  I'm pretty sure it's a lot harder being in a,
[38:06.310 --> 38:10.430]  well, no, you, I've, uh, we have an auto water system that waters rose and I walk
[38:10.430 --> 38:12.590]  and walk the rows and look at every sprinkler every day.
[38:12.590 --> 38:13.990]  And as I'm walking, I got my hands out.
[38:13.990 --> 38:14.470]  Yes.
[38:14.510 --> 38:14.790]  And.
[38:15.190 --> 38:16.150]  This may sound crazy.
[38:16.150 --> 38:17.030]  People don't think of this.
[38:17.030 --> 38:19.870]  You can tell if your grow room is too hot or too cold by reaching out and squeezing
[38:19.870 --> 38:21.870]  your plants and seeing if they're too hot or too cold.
[38:21.910 --> 38:22.870]  Now you ever check your baby.
[38:22.870 --> 38:25.230]  You just put your head on your kid's forehead or don't know.
[38:25.230 --> 38:25.870]  You're fucking cold.
[38:25.870 --> 38:26.470]  You need a sweater.
[38:26.710 --> 38:26.870]  Dude.
[38:26.870 --> 38:27.470]  I know that.
[38:27.470 --> 38:27.750]  Yeah.
[38:27.750 --> 38:28.350]  Grab a plant.
[38:28.350 --> 38:29.070]  Check the same thing.
[38:29.070 --> 38:31.710]  If those plants feel cold to your hands, the plants are probably cold.
[38:31.710 --> 38:31.830]  Yeah.
[38:31.830 --> 38:32.670]  They're probably eating.
[38:32.750 --> 38:32.990]  Yeah.
[38:33.030 --> 38:33.270]  Yep.
[38:33.270 --> 38:33.750]  Exactly.
[38:33.750 --> 38:36.470]  See those lowers going like this and the uppers are like this and you're
[38:36.470 --> 38:39.470]  spending their whole day trying to keep themselves warm and getting skinny.
[38:39.470 --> 38:41.390]  Cause they're burning calories, not doing anything.
[38:41.510 --> 38:41.830]  Yeah.
[38:41.870 --> 38:42.750]  Wasting cars.
[38:42.910 --> 38:43.110]  Yeah.
[38:44.390 --> 38:44.710]  All right.
[38:44.950 --> 38:46.670]  So guys, we've gone for about 40 minutes.
[38:46.750 --> 38:50.550]  Uh, is there anything else you feel like you need to talk about in no till
[38:50.550 --> 38:53.990]  gardening before we turn this into a dab off and just a giggle fest with a bunch
[38:53.990 --> 38:54.430]  of bros?
[38:55.110 --> 38:56.390]  Um, no, I would just say.
[38:57.230 --> 39:02.150]  You know, veg in your no-till pots or veg in your beds or, you know, however
[39:02.150 --> 39:04.310]  you can do that, you know, that's why I'm not doing beds right now.
[39:04.310 --> 39:09.990]  It's just easier for me to, uh, you know, have, uh, you know, I guess, you
[39:09.990 --> 39:13.870]  know, a space to veg and then, uh, you know, a space to flower and stuff like
[39:13.870 --> 39:18.750]  that in the, in the future and stuff like that, I want to veg in a different
[39:18.750 --> 39:21.590]  rooms and a flower in different rooms, stuff like that, you know, whenever I
[39:21.590 --> 39:24.790]  get more space and stuff like that, it's just now you got to get out of town to
[39:24.790 --> 39:27.910]  be able to stay compliant with your, uh, plant count and stuff like that.
[39:27.910 --> 39:29.150]  You can't be in residential.
[39:29.150 --> 39:32.230]  So I'm trying to move out of town and trying to get into some, uh,
[39:32.270 --> 39:33.550]  agricultural or something like that.
[39:33.870 --> 39:35.110]  Or I'll just rent a warehouse.
[39:35.110 --> 39:37.150]  I was thinking about, you know, just getting a warehouse or something like
[39:37.150 --> 39:38.990]  that, just, just staying compliant and stuff like that.
[39:39.030 --> 39:39.990]  I got to grow my medicine.
[39:39.990 --> 39:43.230]  You know, I'm not going to go buy some bullshit from, uh, somebody
[39:43.230 --> 39:44.870]  that, uh, grow some ass.
[39:44.870 --> 39:49.430]  You know, there's a few no-till places, uh, that grow some pot here in Colorado.
[39:49.430 --> 39:53.230]  There's a few, uh, no-till places in, uh, I'll say some of them grow some, uh,
[39:53.750 --> 39:58.310]  some decent pot and some of them grow some, uh, some Supreme pot.
[39:58.310 --> 40:01.990]  Some people, some people grow some, the, the no-till growers out here are
[40:01.990 --> 40:05.270]  definitely, you know, they're, they're doing, I would say a sins growing some
[40:05.270 --> 40:09.070]  Supreme pot, I would say, uh, Verde is doing a more of a living soul.
[40:09.070 --> 40:11.750]  They're not no-till, but they're, you know, they're, they're reamending the
[40:11.750 --> 40:13.470]  soil and just doing their thing.
[40:13.870 --> 40:14.910]  Verde is very good.
[40:14.910 --> 40:16.630]  It's Chuck the lemon man still behind Verde.
[40:16.910 --> 40:18.630]  Um, I don't, I don't know, man.
[40:19.390 --> 40:21.910]  You would have to see, um, they're, they're killing it though.
[40:22.070 --> 40:24.350]  They're doing good and stuff like that, but there's a few other no-till
[40:24.350 --> 40:25.190]  place, stuff like that.
[40:25.190 --> 40:28.790]  And, you know, I mean, it's, it's kind of, it's, it's subpar and stuff like that.
[40:28.790 --> 40:30.310]  You know, I don't know if they're spraying too late.
[40:30.310 --> 40:33.390]  I don't know if they're spraying oils, you know, sometimes they just don't
[40:33.390 --> 40:34.670]  smoke correctly and stuff like that.
[40:34.670 --> 40:37.310]  You know, I'm not going to say any names, but you know, just, just people
[40:37.310 --> 40:41.510]  need to, you know, appreciate really what they're, uh, what they're doing,
[40:41.550 --> 40:43.110]  uh, with the plan and stuff like that.
[40:43.110 --> 40:45.830]  And really think about the people and stuff like that and think about, you
[40:45.830 --> 40:47.150]  know, having a superior price.
[40:47.150 --> 40:51.030]  If you're having my problems or having to spray late and flower and stuff like
[40:51.070 --> 40:53.710]  that crazy light and flower, you're doing things incorrectly.
[40:54.030 --> 40:54.630]  Exactly.
[40:54.710 --> 40:55.230]  You know what I'm saying?
[40:55.230 --> 40:55.630]  Exactly.
[40:55.630 --> 40:57.070]  And a spray isn't the solution.
[40:57.150 --> 40:58.830]  It is not a problem is the solution.
[40:58.830 --> 40:59.750]  There's a better reason.
[40:59.830 --> 41:02.110]  There's a, you don't get a weird bump on your face because you
[41:02.110 --> 41:03.030]  have a bump on your face.
[41:03.030 --> 41:03.990]  You get a weird bump on your face.
[41:03.990 --> 41:05.950]  Cause you ate too much sugar or you got cancer.
[41:06.110 --> 41:07.310]  You got to research a little deeper.
[41:07.310 --> 41:08.590]  You got to stop eating the sugar.
[41:08.590 --> 41:09.790]  You got to get rid of the cancer.
[41:09.990 --> 41:12.430]  You got to solve the problem or the bumps going to come back.
[41:12.430 --> 41:13.750]  The mites are going to keep coming back.
[41:13.790 --> 41:14.870]  Jeff's going to keep happening.
[41:14.990 --> 41:16.830]  I'm going to take a medium sized dab.
[41:17.110 --> 41:20.030]  Uh, one of you guys feel free to pitch yourself shamelessly.
[41:20.870 --> 41:21.390]  Ha ha.
[41:24.830 --> 41:25.390]  Well, that was good.
[41:25.390 --> 41:26.270]  Uh, Oh yeah.
[41:26.310 --> 41:28.790]  That one looked a lot, a lot better than the other one you took to.
[41:29.750 --> 41:30.390]  Let me smell it.
[41:30.590 --> 41:33.670]  That was actually grown, uh, at three rivers by myself and my crew.
[41:33.790 --> 41:34.390]  Oh, nice.
[41:35.190 --> 41:37.470]  Jeff's over there killing it over there at three rivers right now.
[41:38.830 --> 41:44.750]  If y'all come to, uh, come through the Pueblo Colorado area, I would say,
[41:44.750 --> 41:46.470]  uh, you know, go to three rivers.
[41:46.470 --> 41:51.550]  We don't really have many places I hear that, uh, have any, uh, superior pot,
[41:52.190 --> 41:54.230]  but, uh, Jeff grows some good pot for sure.
[41:54.230 --> 41:55.710]  You can go check out his pictures on Instagram.
[41:55.710 --> 41:56.150]  You can see that.
[41:57.070 --> 41:58.750]  That good old fire that he'd be growing right there.
[41:58.790 --> 41:59.310]  Yeah.
[41:59.470 --> 42:00.550]  Thank you for the Instagram plug.
[42:00.550 --> 42:02.190]  It's IRI underscore genetics.
[42:02.350 --> 42:04.510]  Uh, what I just took a dab of was a berry cooler.
[42:04.510 --> 42:06.870]  It's Brian, berry, cough mixed with Ecto cooler.
[42:07.510 --> 42:09.630]  All that Ecto coolers, fire, cool.
[42:09.630 --> 42:10.310]  It's so fire.
[42:11.110 --> 42:12.750]  Does it turn like magenta and shit?
[42:12.750 --> 42:14.350]  Like it's like cookies.
[42:14.390 --> 42:18.150]  It goes magenta and black and purple and yeah, it makes colors.
[42:18.150 --> 42:18.470]  Yeah.
[42:18.590 --> 42:19.230]  It's a colorful one.
[42:19.230 --> 42:19.950]  I got some of my posts.
[42:19.950 --> 42:20.270]  I'll show you.
[42:20.270 --> 42:20.470]  Yeah.
[42:20.470 --> 42:20.670]  Yeah.
[42:20.670 --> 42:21.190]  I love her.
[42:21.230 --> 42:21.470]  Yeah.
[42:21.470 --> 42:23.830]  She gets, so she looks like a, she looks like Callie weed.
[42:23.990 --> 42:24.710]  Yeah, for sure.
[42:24.750 --> 42:25.030]  Yeah.
[42:25.070 --> 42:28.550]  What's your favorite of your, uh, of your hybrids that you created thus far?
[42:29.310 --> 42:32.390]  Uh, somebody asked me a question similar to that the other day and my favorites.
[42:32.710 --> 42:36.870]  Uh, probably whatever I haven't grown yet that I've got seeds of those
[42:36.870 --> 42:38.510]  are always just the new one.
[42:38.550 --> 42:38.830]  Yeah.
[42:38.830 --> 42:40.630]  Whenever I'm about to germinate next night.
[42:40.630 --> 42:40.950]  Yeah.
[42:41.030 --> 42:42.510]  Like that's my favorite right now.
[42:42.910 --> 42:44.070]  Uh, there's some stuff I've read.
[42:44.070 --> 42:45.190]  That's never been grown.
[42:45.190 --> 42:49.230]  Like chem four to arise and platinum Angie to arise.
[42:49.510 --> 42:50.910]  Jack flash to arise.
[42:51.110 --> 42:52.390]  That shit's never been grown.
[42:52.390 --> 42:54.550]  There are about nine strains that have never even been
[42:54.670 --> 42:55.030]  platinum.
[42:55.030 --> 42:55.430]  Tangy.
[42:55.430 --> 42:55.710]  Okay.
[42:55.710 --> 42:56.110]  All right.
[42:56.110 --> 42:56.750]  Sounds pretty.
[42:56.750 --> 42:58.430]  It's a Spence's from garden of Wheaton.
[42:58.430 --> 42:59.630]  That would be a good extract.
[42:59.670 --> 43:01.270]  Platinum cookies to the Tangy.
[43:01.270 --> 43:02.830]  And I crossed it to, yeah.
[43:02.910 --> 43:03.990]  Not to the garden of Wheaton.
[43:03.990 --> 43:04.190]  Yeah.
[43:04.190 --> 43:05.030]  Shout out to the family.
[43:05.070 --> 43:05.670]  Nice.
[43:05.990 --> 43:07.870]  Uh, but chem four, there's a lot of good ones.
[43:07.870 --> 43:09.350]  Candid dental to the arise.
[43:09.670 --> 43:11.030]  There's a lot of good stuff in my vault.
[43:11.030 --> 43:12.350]  That's never been even killing it.
[43:12.550 --> 43:12.750]  Yeah.
[43:12.750 --> 43:13.230]  Well, thank you.
[43:13.310 --> 43:13.830]  Yeah.
[43:13.830 --> 43:13.990]  Yeah.
[43:13.990 --> 43:14.430]  You're killing it.
[43:14.430 --> 43:16.070]  Rise wants to put pollen on everything.
[43:16.070 --> 43:18.870]  And then I'm kind of working on another breeding project here pretty soon that
[43:18.870 --> 43:20.630]  we'll talk about, uh, in the future.
[43:20.630 --> 43:24.270]  I want to get it a little more underway and secured before I brag about that.
[43:24.270 --> 43:24.870]  It's going to be neat.
[43:25.510 --> 43:27.750]  I want, I want to get some, uh, some ivory back in my garden.
[43:27.750 --> 43:29.990]  I had some, uh, what was that?
[43:29.990 --> 43:31.470]  That cookie stomper that you did?
[43:31.470 --> 43:31.790]  Oh yeah.
[43:31.830 --> 43:33.030]  The king cookie stomper.
[43:33.070 --> 43:33.670]  Yeah.
[43:33.710 --> 43:36.750]  You know, I had some good ones of those for a while and stuff like that, but
[43:36.750 --> 43:37.910]  you know, we ended up letting them go.
[43:37.910 --> 43:41.790]  Just bringing in so many strains and, you know, was that before we went over to
[43:42.790 --> 43:47.310]  um, no, I think I did a, that no till like maybe once or twice, um, you know,
[43:47.310 --> 43:50.070]  maybe one or two times, but I was still doing like some super soils and stuff
[43:50.070 --> 43:51.390]  like that, super soils is cool.
[43:51.390 --> 43:54.470]  You just gotta, you know, just really be feeding enzymes like fucking constantly
[43:54.470 --> 43:55.990]  just to speed up decomposition.
[43:55.990 --> 43:57.470]  Cause you know, there's no ecosystem.
[43:57.470 --> 43:58.350]  There's no worms.
[43:58.350 --> 43:59.430]  There's nothing eating it for you.
[43:59.470 --> 44:01.190]  It's got to break down slowly by itself.
[44:01.190 --> 44:01.870]  Just a living soil.
[44:01.870 --> 44:03.590]  You got to feed a lot of microbes and stuff like that.
[44:03.630 --> 44:06.230]  His soil, his, his soil is so far along right now.
[44:06.230 --> 44:09.670]  It's as you can, it's kind of not comparable to like early, early
[44:09.670 --> 44:11.190]  beginning stages of no till.
[44:11.190 --> 44:12.910]  Like his pots are taking care of them.
[44:12.910 --> 44:13.910]  So it was like crazy.
[44:14.070 --> 44:14.990]  I think they're super.
[44:14.990 --> 44:17.950]  So last time you were here, you said you were on like round six
[44:17.950 --> 44:19.430]  or seven of your no till pots.
[44:19.590 --> 44:20.670]  So that's how long it's been.
[44:20.670 --> 44:22.070]  And it's been quite a while since we were here.
[44:22.350 --> 44:22.670]  Yeah.
[44:22.670 --> 44:22.830]  Yeah.
[44:22.830 --> 44:23.870]  Probably the same dirt.
[44:24.030 --> 44:26.790]  I have some rounds that are super far in the year.
[44:26.870 --> 44:27.070]  Yeah.
[44:27.070 --> 44:28.510]  It's probably the same during that.
[44:28.510 --> 44:29.110]  It's crazy.
[44:29.110 --> 44:32.270]  Like all, uh, even top dressing stuff a lot and stuff like that.
[44:32.270 --> 44:35.190]  And, uh, you know, uh, transplant and stuff like that.
[44:35.510 --> 44:37.670]  I'll be like, man, you know, there's, there's a lot of dirt up here.
[44:37.670 --> 44:40.190]  There's a, there's a lot of, uh, you know, mulch and stuff like that.
[44:40.190 --> 44:43.270]  These pots are overflowing and stuff like that before, you know, then things
[44:43.270 --> 44:45.190]  are like broken down and shit like that.
[44:45.190 --> 44:46.790]  And they're back like in the pot and stuff.
[44:47.310 --> 44:48.830]  You know, it's, I mean, it's crazy.
[44:50.150 --> 44:50.950]  I mean, it's crazy.
[44:51.030 --> 44:52.790]  You have to constantly cut it and stuff like that.
[44:52.790 --> 44:54.190]  Try and grow with the plants and stuff.
[44:54.190 --> 44:54.790]  That's right.
[44:55.030 --> 44:55.950]  It's fucking awesome.
[44:55.950 --> 44:58.590]  When you're, when you've got room to germinate seeds, man, you let me know,
[44:58.590 --> 45:00.310]  and I'll give you what my newest hottest shit is.
[45:00.350 --> 45:02.510]  I'll make sure you get the fresh, fresh, new, new.
[45:02.630 --> 45:02.950]  Yeah.
[45:02.990 --> 45:03.310]  Yeah.
[45:03.430 --> 45:03.590]  Yeah.
[45:03.590 --> 45:05.630]  I would like to find some good keepers and stuff like that.
[45:05.630 --> 45:05.950]  There's good.
[45:05.950 --> 45:08.950]  And then just bring me a clone and we'll, yeah, we'll keep it going.
[45:08.990 --> 45:13.110]  I'm trying to do a little fake, a little few crosses of my own and stuff like that.
[45:13.110 --> 45:17.550]  You know, just trying to, uh, you know, do some, uh, you know, some few branches
[45:17.550 --> 45:19.710]  and stuff like that, let me know if you need advice, man.
[45:19.870 --> 45:20.270]  Yeah.
[45:21.350 --> 45:22.990]  I would even like some pollen or something like that.
[45:23.430 --> 45:26.510]  So I can just hit a few brands, take a plan out, hit a few branches and stuff
[45:26.510 --> 45:28.990]  like that, spray it down and stuff like that and put it back in.
[45:29.670 --> 45:32.950]  You know, you got to do basically just get those, get those few branches and
[45:32.950 --> 45:36.150]  stuff like that, or those seeds and stuff like that good pollen is the hard part.
[45:36.230 --> 45:37.750]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[45:37.750 --> 45:38.510]  That's what I'm saying.
[45:38.630 --> 45:41.190]  We would like some good pollen, you know, if young, young Jeff,
[45:42.070 --> 45:42.630]  be job.
[45:45.510 --> 45:46.030]  We may work.
[45:46.030 --> 45:48.390]  So there may be some, uh, some iry frost.
[45:48.710 --> 45:50.190]  Collabs here in the future.
[45:50.190 --> 45:53.830]  And that would be lit, you know, frozen mountain genetics or some shit.
[45:53.870 --> 45:55.550]  Hey, I brought that glue out here, man.
[45:55.550 --> 45:59.350]  I got that gorilla glue from some guys that, uh, literally knew Josie Wells in
[45:59.350 --> 46:00.990]  the mountain, uh, Nevada back then.
[46:00.990 --> 46:03.710]  And, uh, my buddy Gary gave it to me back in college.
[46:03.710 --> 46:08.430]  I'm talking about, we had this thing like 2010, 2011, dude, we've kept this
[46:08.430 --> 46:09.350]  gorilla glue this long.
[46:09.350 --> 46:11.750]  So you can talk about how long that is.
[46:11.750 --> 46:12.110]  Yeah.
[46:12.150 --> 46:12.350]  Yeah.
[46:12.350 --> 46:15.590]  I've had my flow cut since I think 2008 or seven.
[46:15.590 --> 46:16.870]  That's that Colorado flow though.
[46:16.870 --> 46:17.230]  Yeah.
[46:17.310 --> 46:17.630]  Yeah.
[46:17.670 --> 46:19.310]  A lot of people have some boot flows and shit.
[46:19.310 --> 46:22.670]  Now I don't know where all these, you know, poopy ass bullshit flows came from.
[46:22.670 --> 46:23.550]  I think it's like a.
[46:24.350 --> 46:25.190]  Something sister.
[46:25.190 --> 46:26.270]  What's, what's the one that's real.
[46:26.270 --> 46:27.230]  So it is sister.
[46:27.230 --> 46:30.470]  How does that really, I think a lot of people have that and it's just like,
[46:30.470 --> 46:32.510]  they're calling it flow and it's just not the flow, man.
[46:32.550 --> 46:32.790]  Yeah.
[46:32.790 --> 46:35.910]  That Colorado flow is, it almost gives you like an Indica high.
[46:35.910 --> 46:37.590]  It's real sweet and real fucking.
[46:37.710 --> 46:39.990]  It's got that real sweet Tardo G type.
[46:40.630 --> 46:40.950]  Right.
[46:40.950 --> 46:43.350]  Incense and hippie feet kind of a smell going on.
[46:43.390 --> 46:43.670]  Yeah.
[46:43.670 --> 46:44.070]  Yeah.
[46:44.070 --> 46:44.350]  Yeah.
[46:44.350 --> 46:45.230]  I love it.
[46:45.390 --> 46:48.230]  This is not like, like a, like a piney, like kind of has a piney.
[46:48.230 --> 46:48.430]  Yeah.
[46:48.430 --> 46:48.710]  Yeah.
[46:48.710 --> 46:48.910]  Yeah.
[46:48.910 --> 46:50.910]  I, there's something about it that I do not like.
[46:51.030 --> 46:52.950]  Uh, and there's also plenty of things I do like.
[46:53.070 --> 46:54.030]  It was nice back in the day.
[46:54.030 --> 46:56.350]  I remember like I had the Colorado flow way back in the day.
[46:56.350 --> 46:57.230]  A few times it was good.
[46:57.270 --> 46:58.150]  I still have that cut.
[46:58.230 --> 46:58.990]  Might've came from you.
[46:58.990 --> 46:59.270]  Yeah.
[46:59.310 --> 46:59.790]  Possibly.
[46:59.790 --> 47:00.510]  Probably came from you.
[47:00.510 --> 47:02.310]  I'm pretty sure I smoked it with Spencer and shit like that.
[47:02.310 --> 47:03.310]  Probably started.
[47:03.310 --> 47:03.550]  Yeah.
[47:03.550 --> 47:03.750]  Yeah.
[47:03.750 --> 47:04.710]  I shared that cut a lot.
[47:04.830 --> 47:05.030]  Yeah.
[47:05.030 --> 47:05.270]  Nice.
[47:05.270 --> 47:06.550]  Make so much great clones.
[47:06.630 --> 47:06.910]  Yeah.
[47:06.950 --> 47:07.910]  Fucking cut it.
[47:07.910 --> 47:08.630]  And it's got roots.
[47:08.710 --> 47:09.950]  He was really well too, right?
[47:10.190 --> 47:10.430]  Yeah.
[47:10.430 --> 47:13.390]  It's a, and it's easy to grow and it turns purple and stink.
[47:13.390 --> 47:14.190]  So people love it.
[47:15.590 --> 47:15.790]  Yeah.
[47:15.790 --> 47:15.990]  Yeah.
[47:15.990 --> 47:16.710]  Leafy as shit.
[47:16.750 --> 47:17.550]  Oh yeah.
[47:17.590 --> 47:18.270]  Leafy as shit.
[47:18.550 --> 47:19.110]  I hate those.
[47:19.110 --> 47:20.150]  But you know, yeah.
[47:20.190 --> 47:20.430]  Oh yeah.
[47:20.430 --> 47:24.030]  I'll be, can I'll be becali nowadays I'm trimming on my own pop me and my lady
[47:24.030 --> 47:25.670]  and you know, young piff over here.
[47:25.670 --> 47:27.990]  So it's just like, I'm trying to grow some strains.
[47:27.990 --> 47:28.790]  I don't really have to.
[47:28.870 --> 47:29.030]  Yeah.
[47:29.030 --> 47:29.590]  We got a lot.
[47:29.590 --> 47:31.590]  We got a lot of new age genetics.
[47:31.590 --> 47:34.150]  I would say, you know, I mean, we got some orange cream.
[47:35.710 --> 47:36.870]  Uh, Oh, geez.
[47:36.870 --> 47:41.230]  That are definitely staples stones that will never be old, but we got a, we got
[47:41.230 --> 47:45.990]  some like orange cream and the white Tahoe cookies and the papaya and like some
[47:45.990 --> 47:50.310]  stuff that is just like really sought after, you know, like terpene wise and I
[47:50.310 --> 47:51.030]  guess nugs.
[47:51.270 --> 47:52.510]  I hear a lot about the papaya.
[47:52.750 --> 47:52.990]  Yeah.
[47:53.030 --> 47:54.470]  I don't have any experience with the papaya.
[47:55.030 --> 47:55.950]  I'll shoot you the papaya.
[47:55.950 --> 47:56.630]  You're like, I'll shoot you.
[47:56.630 --> 47:59.430]  Go ahead and throw that on the motherfucking air real quick.
[47:59.430 --> 48:00.310]  I'll shoot Jeff.
[48:00.310 --> 48:02.670]  The papaya got the papaya in-house bitches.
[48:02.790 --> 48:04.270]  What do you call a rise to papaya?
[48:04.310 --> 48:05.270]  That's the new question.
[48:05.310 --> 48:06.270]  Dude, it's really good.
[48:06.270 --> 48:09.510]  It throws like a, so even in the notes and stuff like that, that's, that's the
[48:09.510 --> 48:12.510]  thing that I found out with no-till is, you know, it allows the plants to really
[48:12.510 --> 48:13.990]  express all their own.
[48:14.750 --> 48:15.270]  Yeah.
[48:15.270 --> 48:18.630]  We were talking earlier before we recorded, there's a certain nutrient brand that if
[48:18.630 --> 48:22.070]  you feed your plants, that nutrient brand, if you grow 10 strains, it looks like you
[48:22.070 --> 48:23.310]  grew one stream.
[48:23.910 --> 48:24.350]  Shit.
[48:24.470 --> 48:24.830]  Yeah.
[48:25.270 --> 48:26.390]  It's like, you know, you want that.
[48:26.430 --> 48:27.910]  And it's, it's equivalent with the high.
[48:27.910 --> 48:29.870]  I mean, it transitions hand for hand.
[48:29.910 --> 48:30.670]  Um, right.
[48:30.670 --> 48:34.510]  When you, when you smoke no-till you, I mean, if you're smoking, something's going
[48:34.510 --> 48:36.390]  to wreck you, you're going to get wrecked.
[48:36.390 --> 48:39.990]  And it's not like there's a ceiling on it, like that you top out and there when you
[48:39.990 --> 48:42.510]  keep getting higher, like you're just going to keep getting stone.
[48:42.510 --> 48:43.630]  I think it's just more pure.
[48:44.230 --> 48:47.230]  That, that one time, whenever you said that, uh, there was all kinds of trichomes
[48:47.230 --> 48:49.310]  caked on the weed, like extra caked on the weed.
[48:49.550 --> 48:53.710]  I think whenever y'all use these synthetics and stuff like that, or even just like,
[48:53.910 --> 48:57.190]  you know, organic synthetics or whatever, just a bottle and stuff like that, that is
[48:57.190 --> 48:58.430]  a synthesized nutrient.
[48:58.710 --> 48:59.470]  I think it's building.
[48:59.670 --> 49:04.950]  Calyx is so big and it's building trichomes so big that like these trichomes, like, you
[49:04.950 --> 49:05.310]  know what I mean?
[49:05.310 --> 49:06.790]  It's good for extracting shit like that.
[49:06.830 --> 49:08.590]  You're getting huge trichomes shit like that.
[49:08.830 --> 49:11.350]  I think we aren't getting as big of trichomes.
[49:11.950 --> 49:12.230]  Okay.
[49:12.230 --> 49:13.550]  We're getting more trichomes.
[49:13.590 --> 49:13.910]  All right.
[49:14.270 --> 49:15.110]  You see what I'm saying?
[49:15.190 --> 49:16.190]  Like it's just caked up.
[49:16.190 --> 49:19.350]  Like, it's just like a whole bunch of little fire ass trichomes just caked up more
[49:19.350 --> 49:21.870]  natural type of like trichomes, stuff like that.
[49:22.030 --> 49:26.470]  I'd say our turps are more, you know, prevalent than any type of bottle and stuff
[49:26.470 --> 49:26.870]  like that.
[49:27.110 --> 49:27.510]  Definitely.
[49:27.510 --> 49:31.270]  So, especially when you get it down into bag form, not even, not even an extract
[49:31.270 --> 49:33.710]  form, that, that for sure is probably definitely so.
[49:33.710 --> 49:38.990]  But when you get it down to a bag form, I think soil grown weed is just so much
[49:38.990 --> 49:39.350]  louder.
[49:39.350 --> 49:42.270]  Like it finds your nose versus you going to find the smell.
[49:42.310 --> 49:43.710]  Turps for days, you know.
[49:43.830 --> 49:45.030]  We all love the turps.
[49:45.070 --> 49:45.390]  Yeah.
[49:45.430 --> 49:46.430]  That's what it's all about nowadays.
[49:46.510 --> 49:46.670]  Yeah.
[49:46.670 --> 49:47.670]  The turps are what drive the high.
[49:47.710 --> 49:48.910]  The THC makes you go up.
[49:48.950 --> 49:50.990]  The turps decide how you're going to get there.
[49:51.310 --> 49:52.190]  You're going to get the munchies.
[49:52.190 --> 49:53.190]  You're going to get a high high.
[49:53.430 --> 49:54.390]  You're going to get paranoid.
[49:54.390 --> 49:55.550]  That's all about them turps.
[49:55.550 --> 49:55.790]  Yeah.
[49:55.910 --> 49:56.950]  So I agree.
[49:57.390 --> 49:57.990]  Turps.
[49:58.270 --> 49:58.670]  Turps.
[49:59.150 --> 49:59.710]  All right, boys.
[49:59.790 --> 50:01.310]  We've been going for close to an hour here.
[50:01.590 --> 50:03.750]  Um, I want to thank you guys again for coming and hanging out.
[50:03.750 --> 50:07.150]  Let's remind everybody how they can find you on social media over here.
[50:07.150 --> 50:08.470]  It's frosty organics.
[50:08.470 --> 50:09.350]  Just like the sound, right?
[50:09.350 --> 50:10.110]  Frosty organics.
[50:10.150 --> 50:12.430]  Um, yeah, just hit me up on there.
[50:12.430 --> 50:16.030]  Um, if y'all ever have any questions or anything too, you know, uh, if it's a
[50:16.030 --> 50:17.630]  simple question, I'll get back to you.
[50:17.670 --> 50:19.950]  If it's something crazy, um, I'm a busy person.
[50:20.110 --> 50:20.270]  Yeah.
[50:20.270 --> 50:21.070]  It might take us a minute.
[50:21.070 --> 50:22.190]  We both do a lot of shit.
[50:22.310 --> 50:22.550]  Yeah.
[50:22.590 --> 50:22.830]  Yeah.
[50:22.830 --> 50:24.710]  I, I've got messages just waiting.
[50:24.710 --> 50:25.390]  I apologize.
[50:25.390 --> 50:28.470]  You guys, I know they're there recording a show with frosty and dr.
[50:28.470 --> 50:29.030]  Piff right now.
[50:29.430 --> 50:30.870]  I'll get back with you another time.
[50:31.350 --> 50:31.990]  Uh, and dr.
[50:31.990 --> 50:32.710]  Underscore PIF.
[50:32.710 --> 50:33.230]  Is that correct?
[50:33.230 --> 50:33.390]  Yeah.
[50:33.430 --> 50:33.790]  Dr.
[50:33.790 --> 50:34.670]  Underscore PIF.
[50:34.670 --> 50:38.950]  And, uh, if you, if you want to get ahold of frosty and you're trying to get, get a
[50:38.950 --> 50:44.270]  hold of a product, just be patient as it's very small quantity and we're trying to
[50:44.270 --> 50:47.790]  make sure that people that really are going to enjoy it are going to enjoy it.
[50:47.790 --> 50:48.150]  So.
[50:48.710 --> 50:49.630]  I mean, just be patient.
[50:50.750 --> 50:51.630]  It'll be out there everywhere.
[50:51.630 --> 50:52.190]  Pretty soon.
[50:52.230 --> 50:52.630]  Yeah.
[50:52.830 --> 50:53.510]  It'll be everywhere.
[50:53.510 --> 50:54.030]  Pretty soon.
[50:54.430 --> 50:54.870]  Just wait.
[50:55.190 --> 50:55.830]  I know what's coming.
[50:55.990 --> 50:56.230]  Yeah.
[50:56.390 --> 50:57.310]  I know what's coming.
[50:57.390 --> 50:57.710]  Yeah.
[50:57.990 --> 50:58.390]  All right.
[50:58.430 --> 51:01.270]  I want to thank you guys for coming to join me and taking some, well, I took some
[51:01.270 --> 51:02.590]  dabs, we smoked some joints.
[51:02.910 --> 51:04.870]  It's weird to have a guest that doesn't come take dabs.
[51:05.430 --> 51:06.150]  Yeah, for sure.
[51:06.150 --> 51:07.710]  Thanks for showing up with dank ass flower.

[51:10.230 --> 51:10.950]  I appreciate it.
[51:11.630 --> 51:12.630]  A podcast world.
[51:12.630 --> 51:14.470]  We were going to press pause on this recording.
[51:14.470 --> 51:15.830]  We're going to wrap up this podcast.
[51:15.830 --> 51:17.110]  We're going to take some dabs and hang out.
[51:17.270 --> 51:18.550]  I want to thank everybody for listening.

[51:32.110 --> 51:33.510]  Now I'm trying to catch up.
[51:33.750 --> 51:36.070]  It takes a lot of freaking time.

[51:51.790 --> 51:52.710]  I would appreciate it.
[51:52.710 --> 51:54.270]  I want to thank my guests once again for joining me.
[51:54.270 --> 51:55.670]  They're both recording me with their phones.
[51:55.670 --> 51:57.470]  It got a little awkward really quickly here.
[51:58.070 --> 52:00.470]  Uh, I want to give a big shout out to my friends, Maddie and Spence.
[52:00.590 --> 52:03.110]  You guys, we need to take some dabs very soon.
[52:04.870 --> 52:05.950]  I'm just pausing for your videos.
[52:05.950 --> 52:06.910]  You guys to make it awkward.

[52:56.780 --> 52:57.900]  Tell you what to say.
[52:58.060 --> 52:59.700]  You hang out with the right folks.
[52:59.700 --> 53:00.940]  Become a fashion.
[53:45.890 --> 53:47.810]  People trying to stay alive.
[53:48.290 --> 53:49.650]  Hard living in the city.
[53:50.130 --> 53:53.690]  You find a diamond in the soul, but the gas bills rise.
[53:54.090 --> 53:57.730]  Well, I got to say to them, what's it all mean?
[53:58.050 --> 54:00.770]  You gotta take a loan to pay the bill on the phone.
[54:00.770 --> 54:03.970]  Educated, graduated, but you can't get a job now.
[54:05.250 --> 54:31.540]  Do you want to feel free?
[54:31.540 --> 54:34.980]  Need a little soul shine.
[54:35.540 --> 54:36.540]  Take your time.
[54:37.060 --> 54:37.740]  Go and take it.
[54:38.100 --> 54:39.100]  Wind your mind.
[54:39.100 --> 54:44.510]  Let the soul shine.
[55:13.160 --> 55:14.640]  Need a little soul shine.
[55:16.960 --> 55:17.760]  Take your time.
[55:17.760 --> 55:19.460]  Go and take it.
[55:19.460 --> 55:20.760]  Wind your mind.
[55:23.260 --> 55:25.460]  But we can use a little soul shine.
[55:25.760 --> 55:26.760]  Take your time.
[55:27.880 --> 55:28.880]  Go and take it.
[55:29.240 --> 55:30.240]  Wind your mind.

[55:39.270 --> 55:40.310]  Go and take it.
[55:40.630 --> 55:41.630]  Wind your mind.
[55:42.390 --> 55:46.190]  We can use a little soul shine.
[55:46.230 --> 55:53.230]  A little soul shine, a little soul shine, ha ha
[55:53.230 --> 56:00.420]  We can use a little soul shine, ha ha
