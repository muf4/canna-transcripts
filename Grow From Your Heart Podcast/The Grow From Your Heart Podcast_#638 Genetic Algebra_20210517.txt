[02:00.860 --> 02:04.080]  Do want to thank everybody who sent me an update sent me a message
[02:04.500 --> 02:10.140]  Gave me a heads up that there is a problem with the podcast on Apple podcast stitcher radio
[02:10.380 --> 02:17.660]  Spotify all those services have been having a technical issue with my podcast. I apologize. It is partially my fault
[02:17.660 --> 02:23.220]  It is partly blue host fault blue host did an update something in that update messed up my website
[02:23.220 --> 02:28.820]  You guys don't care about the details. However, I do know that the website either has been or is messed up
[02:28.820 --> 02:33.540]  I don't know if it's fixed by the time this episode comes out at recording time. It is like halfway fixed
[02:33.540 --> 02:36.300]  It seemed like it worked, but it was still kind of funky. Something was weird
[02:36.540 --> 02:41.760]  Anyway, I cannot fix upload correct adjust episodes on that service right now
[02:42.140 --> 02:45.740]  Hopefully by the time this comes out, we'll have some progress. But thank you for the heads up
[02:45.740 --> 02:52.500]  I do apologize that the episodes are not or were not available on the service in which you rely if that ever happens again
[02:52.500 --> 02:57.940]  Please do not be shy to notify me to give me a heads up that hey your podcast is broken. Something's going on
[02:57.940 --> 03:01.820]  I do like that. Sometimes that's how I find I find out that there is an episode
[03:01.820 --> 03:06.200]  So let me know the episodes that have disappeared or will not play will be posted soon
[03:06.200 --> 03:07.420]  Everything will be back to normal
[03:07.420 --> 03:15.020]  If you're hearing this that it's probably fixed in the future if you are not able to find the episodes on Spotify Apple podcast
[03:15.700 --> 03:21.740]  Stitcher radio any of those services simply check out YouTube so far YouTube has been reliable knock on wood
[03:22.260 --> 03:26.380]  YouTube is keeping us up. They haven't taken any videos down. I'm gonna talk any further about that
[03:27.060 --> 03:30.580]  If we disappear on the audio services, please do check out YouTube
[03:30.580 --> 03:34.140]  Maybe you've checked that out by now, but maybe you're just missing shows. I don't know
[03:35.780 --> 03:38.420]  And if you hear this in the future because you've been missing episodes
[03:38.420 --> 03:40.540]  I apologize that you missed a few episodes
[03:40.540 --> 03:45.380]  But please do catch up the episodes will be back in the feed as soon as we get things, correct
[03:45.380 --> 03:49.860]  And it just takes time you guys I got a wonderful web friend a web guy working on it big shout out to my web guy
[03:49.860 --> 03:53.420]  I don't know if he wants his name said out loud or anything, but thank you, bro. You're doing a great job
[03:53.420 --> 03:59.160]  I appreciate it. He interrupted his vacation to work on my website. So that's the awesome kind of dude. He is. Thank you, bro
[03:59.340 --> 04:06.620]  You guys be patient. We'll get it going. What else do I want to talk about the secret stash seed exchange on May 22nd?
[04:06.620 --> 04:13.300]  That's right. I've been talking about groovy gravy presents the secret stash seed exchange in Denver, Colorado on May 22nd
[04:13.300 --> 04:18.500]  I've been saying that most of the slots are sold out. However, they did add another time slot
[04:19.580 --> 04:24.580]  The way that this event is working people are being given a certain amount of time to move through the building
[04:24.580 --> 04:25.860]  You'll get to see all of the vendors
[04:25.860 --> 04:30.380]  You'll get to see all of the exhibits and then your time slot will be up in a new group of people will move into
[04:30.380 --> 04:34.740]  The building this is to adhere to kovat restrictions to keep everybody safe
[04:34.740 --> 04:38.620]  Basically just to be able to be allowed to have a building or an event in a building
[04:38.620 --> 04:44.840]  These are the types of restrictions we need to follow the point is they have added a full another time slot
[04:44.840 --> 04:48.460]  So if you're trying to get tickets and the time you wanted wasn't available or if something wasn't working
[04:48.700 --> 04:53.220]  Now is the time to check back at the website. The website is in the link in the show notes
[04:53.220 --> 04:56.740]  It's in the video description. If you send me a message, I'll make sure to get you a link
[04:56.940 --> 05:01.740]  Also use coupon code Rasta Jeff that will save you 20% off your general admission ticket
[05:01.900 --> 05:04.940]  I'm going to say this again because I'm still getting messages about it
[05:04.940 --> 05:10.940]  Maybe because the podcast is broken and some people can't listen to it, but I cannot help you with booth space
[05:10.940 --> 05:17.660]  It is too late for that. The place is full. I cannot help you with VIP tickets. Those are long sold out
[05:17.920 --> 05:22.720]  Also, I can't help you with any access to the event or tickets to the event or any VIP hookups
[05:22.740 --> 05:25.460]  Other than that coupon code Rasta Jeff
[05:27.580 --> 05:31.460]  All right, I do apologize for the clearing of the throat I've been smoking a little bit of rosin
[05:31.460 --> 05:35.540]  It seems to go heavier in the lungs and throat, but good in stone
[05:35.540 --> 05:40.900]  So shout out to my buddy perp got me nice and heavily medicated. All right, where do we go from there?
[05:40.900 --> 05:42.900]  I think I talked about all the important stuff
[05:43.180 --> 05:49.780]  Another thing I want to talk about on Facebook. I've been seeing people talking on Facebook social media. I scroll too much
[05:49.940 --> 05:52.820]  That's what I do and I'm trying to relax a little bit possibly pooping
[05:53.100 --> 06:00.600]  But let's talk about what I saw on social media people ask often what nutrients should I be using for an outdoor grow?
[06:00.880 --> 06:03.680]  I'm going to address this in another question here soon
[06:03.680 --> 06:09.000]  But the thing you should be using in an outdoor grow something I would recommend is I wouldn't go with the bottled nutrients
[06:09.000 --> 06:17.000]  I would go with amended soil and put that plant right in the amended soil and then feed it water and teas and top dress it
[06:17.000 --> 06:21.320]  Don't focus on bottled nutrients outdoors. That's gonna be a fiasco in my opinion
[06:21.320 --> 06:24.880]  I think it would be more beneficial to focus on building a soil
[06:25.040 --> 06:30.720]  Having a starter soil then amend that as times good time goes on top dress feed it teas
[06:30.720 --> 06:34.200]  Then mainly you just got to keep it wet and things will be okay
[06:34.280 --> 06:38.640]  So when it comes to the best nutrients for an organic outdoor grow
[06:38.640 --> 06:43.260]  I would just build that amended soil and rock with some super soil or something like that again
[06:43.260 --> 06:46.560]  I'm not the organics expert. There are plenty of people out there doing that
[06:47.920 --> 06:52.180]  Plenty of people out there who can give you great organics advice refer to those folks again
[06:52.180 --> 06:54.980]  That is not my area of expertise. I do not want to mess you up
[06:55.500 --> 06:59.300]  All right. I've talked about all the stuff. I wanted to cover the top of the show. I covered the news
[06:59.300 --> 07:04.380]  I covered the social media stuff. I saw let's jump into the main topics of this podcast
[07:04.380 --> 07:11.180]  Which is of course the patreon messages this portion of portion. What is the word? I'm looking for this segment
[07:11.180 --> 07:14.060]  Let's just say segment because the other word I tried to say did not work
[07:14.300 --> 07:19.840]  This segment of the podcast is brought to you by my friend the canna crap big shout out to my buddy the canna crap
[07:19.960 --> 07:22.880]  We don't use corporate sponsors here at the grow from your heart podcast
[07:22.880 --> 07:27.360]  We let our friends be the sponsors shout out to the canna crap for all the continued support
[07:27.560 --> 07:29.440]  Not just grow from your heart podcast
[07:29.440 --> 07:36.680]  But also the IRI genetics support the IRI army wouldn't be what it is without my friend the canna crap big salute, brother
[07:36.680 --> 07:37.320]  All right
[07:37.320 --> 07:41.920]  Now this first message came from my friend lemur priest once again big shout out to lemur priest
[07:42.220 --> 07:47.980]  Captain and commander of the IRI army. He got stoned and started reading stuff on seed packs
[07:47.980 --> 07:52.940]  We're gonna kind of cut his message short because he wrote like multiple pages here
[07:52.940 --> 07:56.140]  I think he had a couple too many dabs
[07:56.340 --> 08:01.780]  Maybe but we're gonna kind of paraphrase what my buddy lemur said we're gonna make a good message out of this
[08:01.780 --> 08:09.420]  It says I got an idea about reading the listed lineages of cultivars on seed packs and websites. That's a really good idea
[08:09.700 --> 08:14.160]  We're gonna get to the topic of this here of what he's actually talking about. It says hey Rasta Jeff
[08:14.200 --> 08:20.240]  I'm humbled by your by the community built around the podcast and your seed company big. Thanks to you
[08:20.400 --> 08:24.320]  I've been able to meet so many amazing growers from all over the world
[08:24.640 --> 08:31.060]  Not everyone knows that there was a time that sharing knowledge tips are helping someone else in their cannabis grow in any way
[08:31.060 --> 08:33.720]  It was a big no-no between being illegal at the time
[08:33.720 --> 08:38.360]  And mostly being used as a way for someone to make or save money and the investment of learning how to grow
[08:38.520 --> 08:42.060]  Relatively on your own there were lots of incentives not to share tips
[08:42.060 --> 08:47.360]  Yes, all of that makes sense back in the day. Why would I teach you how to grow because I'm the weed grower
[08:47.360 --> 08:48.380]  I'm gonna make all the money
[08:48.380 --> 08:50.380]  Why would I give you part of the pie part of the game?
[08:50.460 --> 08:52.860]  You could buy it for me and then resell it if you want
[08:52.860 --> 08:56.220]  But I'm not gonna teach other people how to grow I agree that used to be the mindset
[08:56.580 --> 09:00.800]  That's why it took me a long time to cave in and get into commercial cultivation
[09:00.800 --> 09:04.520]  I didn't want to go teach other people my tricks for an hourly wage that didn't feel right
[09:05.100 --> 09:10.280]  So yes, I was illegal other people couldn't know other people were gonna cut in on your market
[09:10.280 --> 09:12.100]  So we couldn't share tips and now yes
[09:12.100 --> 09:18.100]  We are in a state a realm a time an area a community where we could just share the knowledge and I feel it's kind
[09:18.100 --> 09:24.340]  Of my duty to share the knowledge that I've learned. I talk a lot. I've got the gift of gab. Obviously, I just cannot shut up
[09:24.340 --> 09:26.160]  I can't stop talking and I love cannabis
[09:26.160 --> 09:30.320]  I'm passionate about cannabis and I want you guys to be as good of a grower as me
[09:30.320 --> 09:32.200]  I want you to enjoy cannabis as much as I do
[09:32.200 --> 09:35.560]  So I feel like it's my my duty to come out here and share this
[09:35.560 --> 09:41.200]  Anyway, it says I remember getting lots of strange skeptical looks from grower friends when I would offer advice and tips
[09:41.240 --> 09:42.480]  They would tell me it's weird
[09:42.480 --> 09:46.600]  I would help them improve their plants because they would have better herb and make more money
[09:46.600 --> 09:49.560]  But honestly, I was only thinking about helping plants be happier
[09:49.720 --> 09:51.040]  That's what it's all about bro
[09:51.040 --> 09:56.560]  Make the plants happier the person that grows it is happier the person that smokes it is happier grow from your heart breed with love
[09:56.560 --> 09:58.320]  That's what it's all about
[09:58.320 --> 10:03.720]  He does talk a lot here. Our friend is a teacher. He says I love teaching. I found a place
[10:03.920 --> 10:06.200]  Anyway, we're gonna kind of skip a lot I could ask for advice
[10:06.200 --> 10:11.640]  There's a lot he goes on as the peanut butter breath batter has me ranting and sentimental. Yes, it does brother
[10:11.640 --> 10:16.000]  I had to cut out several paragraphs of what you were saying, but I got nothing but love for you, bro
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.440]  There is a good question in here
[10:18.960 --> 10:24.280]  As I'm looking over my seed collection reading the different parents. I noticed how some can be a little confusing
[10:24.320 --> 10:28.200]  Yes, if you're not immersed in the cannabis world things can be confusing
[10:28.200 --> 10:34.160]  I read genetics does a wonderful job of either using cultivars with names or naming them if you created them
[10:34.160 --> 10:38.200]  However, some breeders are not so helpful with that. Yes when I cross stuff
[10:38.200 --> 10:42.360]  I try to represent the parent names in the cross in some way shape or form or I try to
[10:42.760 --> 10:46.280]  Put the cross on the package really clearly so that you know what I'm working with
[10:46.720 --> 10:52.600]  Says sometimes a new cultivar isn't something that is released and only used for breeding purposes when that happens
[10:52.600 --> 10:55.560]  This is when many of the parentheses are used
[10:55.560 --> 11:00.960]  Could you walk us through some of the things we could see and what they mean for the way they were bred
[11:00.960 --> 11:04.880]  All right. Now this there's a lot of talking going on here, but I understand what you're asking
[11:04.880 --> 11:09.760]  Let me get to answering your question. He does break down some examples
[11:09.760 --> 11:16.200]  He says for example peach OG from ethos is peach crescendo to millions of peaches to quattro
[11:16.200 --> 11:22.160]  Kush f3 how the three cultivars were crossed to make peach OG and how is it different then and then he lists another thing
[11:22.480 --> 11:24.880]  This is this is a good question
[11:24.880 --> 11:28.200]  So let me kind of back up because there is a lot to talk about here
[11:28.200 --> 11:32.200]  I also shot it to lemur for the great message. This is gonna get me talking a lot
[11:32.360 --> 11:36.580]  So the question is when we see multiple strains listed on a seed package
[11:36.580 --> 11:40.880]  How do we know which was the male which crosses were which used in that cross?
[11:41.040 --> 11:46.760]  so a lot of times basically you're going to see strain a X strain B in
[11:47.200 --> 11:52.480]  Basic horticultural practices the standard is to use ladies first
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.680]  female plant X male plant that's going to mean that the male plant was the pollen donor and the
[11:58.840 --> 12:06.200]  Plant listed first of the second plant was the pollen donor. The plant listed first was the pollen receiver. So it's ladies first
[12:06.640 --> 12:08.320]  So we're gonna say
[12:08.320 --> 12:14.120]  Golden goat to daybreaker. You got a golden goat female a daybreaker male that daybreaker pollen
[12:14.400 --> 12:19.200]  Pollen donor pollinated the female I'm stepping all over my words, but we're gonna get there together
[12:19.200 --> 12:25.760]  Just follow along the daybreaker male pollinated the golden goat female to make arise seeds
[12:25.760 --> 12:32.720]  So when you buy a rise seeds, it says arise then in parentheses underneath it golden goat crossed daybreaker
[12:32.880 --> 12:38.920]  That's real easy to understand that that is golden goat and daybreaker. And then you know, the golden goat is just like sweet
[12:39.560 --> 12:45.160]  Candy flavored gum flavored tropical sativa kind of thing with a nice head buzz that makes you fucking weird high
[12:45.160 --> 12:48.920]  And then you know that the daybreaker maybe you know about daybreaker. If not, I'll tell you about it
[12:48.920 --> 12:54.280]  Daybreaker is chem D and Joseph OG and it's real stinky. It smells funky. It's got like
[12:54.920 --> 12:56.920]  burnt tennis balls burnt rubber
[12:57.920 --> 13:02.400]  Gassy skunky foot turps just funky weird shit. Maybe some swamp ass in there
[13:02.480 --> 13:04.200]  It's a short squatty plant
[13:04.200 --> 13:10.640]  So I know both of those plants by name now if I really wanted to I could research both of those golden goat and daybreaker
[13:10.640 --> 13:14.720]  And I could go further and find the parents of each one and then even further to find their parents
[13:14.720 --> 13:20.380]  And I could learn about the family tree the genetics the history the genealogy the breakdown the recipe if you will
[13:20.760 --> 13:23.600]  For each plant, so it's real easy when you've got
[13:24.160 --> 13:27.320]  Plant a and plant B girl plants a boy plant, right?
[13:27.320 --> 13:32.720]  That's real simple for you because you got two ingredients to work with what we were starting to see like our friend lemur
[13:33.640 --> 13:37.940]  Mentioned here and pointed out to us and highlighted is that sometimes we see what do we got?
[13:38.600 --> 13:40.840]  crescendo to millions of peaches to
[13:41.200 --> 13:48.160]  Quattro cush f3 how do we know which plant is the male pollen donor in there because we got three different things
[13:48.760 --> 13:52.020]  One of those had to be a pollen donor one of them had to be a female
[13:52.200 --> 13:57.640]  Then one of those plants had to pollinate something else because you can't put three plants into one mix like that
[13:57.800 --> 14:02.200]  So without a parentheses in the what I would call the appropriate or proper place
[14:02.200 --> 14:05.280]  I don't know which plant was the male I could do research
[14:05.720 --> 14:08.280]  But as a seed seller and a seed breeder
[14:08.280 --> 14:11.000]  Why do I want to give somebody an assignment or homework?
[14:11.120 --> 14:14.040]  When I could just tell you the answer on my seed pack I could say oh
[14:14.040 --> 14:18.700]  That's the quattro cush was the male or the fucking millions of peaches was the male
[14:18.700 --> 14:22.840]  I'm going to assume because of the way it's listed, but you know what happens when I assume
[14:22.840 --> 14:29.760]  I'm gonna make an asset of everybody involved here. I would say the quattro cush f3 was the pollen donor and then probably
[14:30.640 --> 14:36.860]  Crescendo to millions of peaches was one cross and they pollinated that with the quattro cush now
[14:36.860 --> 14:38.880]  Here's a way that they would have made that more clear
[14:38.880 --> 14:44.160]  And it would have been obvious and apparent which the male plant was a set of parentheses
[14:44.320 --> 14:52.480]  Just around two strain names would indicate this is one plant. So I don't know the actual breakdown, but hypothetically we've got peach crescendo
[14:53.320 --> 14:59.160]  To millions of peaches to quattro cush f3 and that's written on two different papers. That's why I'm looking back and forth
[14:59.760 --> 15:05.760]  if I wanted to make it clear which was the male and we're going to just assume for this project for for words and
[15:06.400 --> 15:09.680]  What we're talking about right now that the quattro cush was the male
[15:09.680 --> 15:17.280]  I would simply put peach crescendo to millions of peaches in a parentheses and that would say this is one plant and since that one
[15:17.280 --> 15:19.280]  Plant is listed first
[15:19.280 --> 15:25.840]  In the quattro cush listed after that I would assume the quattro cush is the male what this would tell me is it is peach
[15:25.840 --> 15:27.120]  crescendo
[15:27.120 --> 15:32.080]  Pollinated by millions of peaches that would go in one parentheses that made seeds those seeds were grown
[15:32.080 --> 15:37.520]  We found a keeper there that is peach crescendo to millions of peaches in parentheses that became one plant
[15:37.520 --> 15:39.800]  I would just give that a name to make that easier
[15:39.800 --> 15:41.640]  You know what? I mean, that would be fucking so much easier
[15:41.640 --> 15:45.340]  Give it a name and then you don't have to have two different names X something I digress
[15:45.920 --> 15:49.080]  So in parentheses peach crescendo to millions of peaches
[15:49.080 --> 15:52.720]  I know that's a female peach crescendo pollinated by a male millions of peaches
[15:52.720 --> 15:57.040]  It made seeds then in this case since those two are in the parentheses
[15:57.040 --> 16:03.800]  Then there's an X and there's quattro cush f3 that would indicate to me that the quattro cush f3
[16:04.420 --> 16:09.960]  Pollinated that plant that was in the parentheses there that is going to be our female it turns into algebra
[16:09.960 --> 16:15.400]  It looks like a math problem, but it all makes sense. Once you start to understand it. It makes clear clear sense
[16:15.400 --> 16:19.400]  I'll try to put some stuff on the screen. It depends on what I can do with Final Cut Pro
[16:19.400 --> 16:21.000]  I didn't think that through when I said it
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.480]  But I know I'll be able to put some examples up on the screen because Final Cut Pro is awesome
[16:24.480 --> 16:30.020]  And I'm getting good at it. So, um an example of a male to female would just be male plant or no
[16:30.040 --> 16:35.560]  Sorry, I fucked that up a fan an example of a male to female plant would be listed as female X male
[16:36.200 --> 16:43.240]  Girl plant times male plant makes baby plant. That's that easy, right now. What if we take what if I did not name?
[16:44.160 --> 16:50.520]  Arise what if a rise just didn't get a name it would be golden goat X daybreaker in parentheses
[16:50.520 --> 16:54.840]  That's what that plant would be called because it doesn't have a name. It's a cross golden goats a daybreaker
[16:54.920 --> 17:01.160]  Now what if we cross that to strawberry fields to make the strawberry starburst? It would be golden goat
[17:01.600 --> 17:08.640]  X daybreaker in parentheses X strawberry fields that would make the strawberry starburst there
[17:08.640 --> 17:12.320]  I'm not sure what I said, so I'm trying to think all this all at once but that would make the strawberry starburst there
[17:13.080 --> 17:19.080]  So it's all about that parentheses. I'm gonna read more into lemurs message and make sure I keep myself on track here
[17:19.080 --> 17:22.440]  He says how is that different from okay? How is the?
[17:23.040 --> 17:26.320]  peach OG from ethos, how is that different than
[17:27.680 --> 17:30.160]  Stromulon from Romulan genetics, which is in parentheses
[17:30.880 --> 17:37.040]  Forum cut Girl Scout cookies X purple panty dropper in parentheses crossed to Romulan
[17:37.040 --> 17:39.520]  So it's forum cut Girl Scout cookies X
[17:40.520 --> 17:45.600]  Purple panty dropper and those two are in parentheses and then that is listed X Romulan
[17:45.600 --> 17:49.960]  Which is a very clear description right there that tells me that in this first set of parentheses
[17:50.040 --> 17:52.560]  We have got forum cut Girl Scout cookies
[17:52.680 --> 17:57.760]  Cross to the purple panty dropper if they listed that correctly if they followed industry standard
[17:57.760 --> 18:00.480]  That is a forum cut Girl Scout cookies female
[18:00.840 --> 18:06.540]  Which is clone only so that would make sense that that's a female clone only is a whole nother fucking can of worms to open
[18:07.060 --> 18:13.380]  We got this forum cut cookies pollinated by a purple panty dropper that made one plant that was grown
[18:13.420 --> 18:16.700]  They found a keeper out of that plant in this scenario
[18:16.700 --> 18:22.940]  It was female because it is listed first that was pollinated by a male Romulan plant
[18:22.940 --> 18:30.620]  So we've got parentheses starting parentheses, right forum cut Girl Scout cookies X purple panty dropper closing parentheses
[18:30.620 --> 18:35.340]  That's all in the set of parentheses there X Romulan. So you're gonna get I'm gonna call it
[18:36.260 --> 18:37.860]  Purple
[18:37.860 --> 18:41.740]  Cookie dropper right? It's fucking purple panty dropper and Girl Scout cookies
[18:41.740 --> 18:44.100]  Just name that something and we can make this a lot easier
[18:44.540 --> 18:49.420]  Purple cookie dropper to Romulan and that's gonna be fucking the Klingon or some shit
[18:49.420 --> 18:53.420]  We're just gonna call it Klingon. They see it happened that quickly. We made a strain we named it
[18:53.420 --> 18:56.380]  We got rid of all the fucking parentheses so much easier that way
[18:56.660 --> 18:59.900]  The next example that lemur throws at me is how about?
[19:00.620 --> 19:07.020]  How how Girl Scout cookie to purple panty dropper wasn't a named strain that was released and used in the breeding project not to be
[19:07.020 --> 19:08.020]  confused
[19:08.020 --> 19:14.260]  Yeah, you're that's exactly what I was talking about that plant wasn't named so it doesn't have a name which makes everything confusing here
[19:14.260 --> 19:16.380]  He asked about another one if you're feeling adventurous
[19:16.380 --> 19:23.860]  There is snake eyes from moto rebel genetics a big shout-out to moto rebel because I wanted to use snake eyes
[19:23.860 --> 19:28.140]  That's a really great fucking name. I got storm shadow snake eyes would have been a great accompanying name
[19:29.140 --> 19:32.900]  Good work, but I'm glad you beat me to it. I'm not mad at all. It's a fucking good name
[19:32.900 --> 19:36.220]  I'm proud that I wanted to use a name and somebody else had already used it means a good one
[19:36.220 --> 19:39.540]  Anyway, that one is all in parentheses and it says
[19:40.620 --> 19:45.680]  GG for to kosher kush to harijuana number one all in parentheses right there
[19:45.680 --> 19:48.600]  So I don't know but I don't know the male of that one
[19:48.600 --> 19:53.900]  I'm going to assume it's the gorilla glue number four to kosher kush was pollinated by the harijuana number one
[19:54.220 --> 19:57.220]  But again, I'm just assuming I don't know what that breeder did
[19:57.220 --> 20:00.100]  There's a missing parentheses there that doesn't do anything
[20:00.100 --> 20:02.220]  It fucks it all up for me to tell you the truth
[20:02.220 --> 20:08.340]  And then now was X to lemon G to lemon Thai which is going to be a lemon G female
[20:08.420 --> 20:12.100]  Which is clone only pollinated by the lemon Thai male. So
[20:12.860 --> 20:18.740]  Without the correct parentheses order there. That's just a jumbled clusterfuck of a mess and I really don't know
[20:19.500 --> 20:24.420]  What was used I know that it's a GG for to kosher kush to hairy female
[20:24.860 --> 20:29.140]  Pollinated by a lemon OG lemon Thai male, but that GG for kosher kush
[20:29.140 --> 20:33.380]  Harijuana cross couldn't tell you where the male was because of the way it is listed
[20:33.380 --> 20:38.660]  I want to assume that the harijuana was the male because it's last in that list
[20:38.660 --> 20:42.980]  But I can't promise anything because this breeder didn't give me enough information
[20:43.700 --> 20:48.820]  On top of the parentheses you're going to see brackets occasionally so we may have
[20:49.340 --> 20:51.140]  parenthesis
[20:51.140 --> 20:56.180]  Parentheses and then brackets and then they're getting creative on how they do it when you when you see it
[20:56.180 --> 20:57.420]  It will be apparent
[20:57.420 --> 21:00.700]  I'll try to put some of that stuff up on the screen also just so you can see what I'm talking about
[21:00.700 --> 21:03.820]  but that's how instead of using two sets of parentheses because
[21:04.140 --> 21:09.060]  What if I took we're gonna go even further the GG for to kosher kush to harijuana?
[21:09.380 --> 21:14.140]  Cross to the lemon G to lemon Thai. What if I crossed that to the
[21:15.420 --> 21:20.900]  Forum cut GSC to purple panty dropper to Romulan now, we've got so many things with parentheses around it
[21:20.900 --> 21:24.240]  I would just put the brackets around all of that to indicate
[21:24.240 --> 21:28.500]  It's just one fucking thing or put it on either side to show you that it's one big thing
[21:28.620 --> 21:32.340]  This to this to this is actually just it'll make sense once you see it on the screen
[21:32.340 --> 21:37.380]  But sometimes you're gonna see brackets in there that's going to confuse people. That is the next thing people are gonna see
[21:37.740 --> 21:40.700]  So he wraps it up with I think it's a set of parentheses
[21:40.700 --> 21:43.100]  I think I think of it as
[21:43.620 --> 21:49.820]  Each set of parentheses as a plant and inside is what makes it up. There are countless other examples. It might be easier
[21:50.060 --> 21:53.040]  Yes, you're any more examples. We're gonna confuse people more
[21:53.040 --> 21:59.460]  But I think that is the thing that needs to be said inside of each parentheses is each plant and you can tell
[21:59.700 --> 22:05.260]  Which plant was broken down inside of that parentheses and then it's crossed to the thing that it's got X's, too
[22:05.260 --> 22:10.620]  I think you guys understand what I'm trying to say more words on that are just going to make it more foggy
[22:10.700 --> 22:15.060]  All right, lemur. I hope I answered your question. I hope everybody else out there learned something from that
[22:15.060 --> 22:17.060]  I hope I didn't just confuse you more
[22:17.540 --> 22:23.060]  Without seeing it on a screen without writing it. This is kind of hard to teach. It's like algebra
[22:23.060 --> 22:26.940]  You got a you got a fucking follow along with the visual aids and all that stuff all at the same time
[22:27.780 --> 22:31.060]  I'm gonna take a quick drink of some coconut water and then we're gonna continue with the show
[22:31.420 --> 22:34.020]  Don't think I'm gonna press pause. I don't think I'm gonna edit anything
[22:34.020 --> 22:38.420]  I'm just gonna make you endure this drink with me hydrate yourselves and we will continue with the show
[22:51.280 --> 22:56.360]  All right, all right. All right. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to wet my whistle. Let's keep going here
[22:56.360 --> 23:00.120]  This next one is a nutrient and feeding question. I said a moment ago
[23:00.120 --> 23:03.360]  We were going to talk about outdoor feeding and feeding organically
[23:03.360 --> 23:08.340]  This person is growing indoors, but my advice will still apply. Let me start with the message
[23:08.340 --> 23:13.640]  It says greetings and salutations greetings my friend. Thank you for joining me and thank you for the great message
[23:13.640 --> 23:16.080]  It says it's been a while since my last question
[23:16.080 --> 23:18.000]  I hope this finds you in the entire army
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.400]  I re army safely and doing wonderfully in the desire of wanting to become a seed tester for you down the road
[23:23.400 --> 23:27.600]  I've been happily and diligently working toward dialing in my grow room
[23:27.760 --> 23:32.160]  Here are some parameters and then we do go over quite a few parameters, which I will touch on
[23:32.440 --> 23:34.760]  As I answer the actual question
[23:34.760 --> 23:40.000]  We don't need to read all of the parameters a lot of the question will lead us back up there to talk about that
[23:40.000 --> 23:46.040]  So it says first off. I'm trying to be as organic of a grower as possible. That's admirable
[23:46.040 --> 23:50.440]  I do appreciate and respect that says can you see any flaws or possible?
[23:50.680 --> 23:56.400]  Deficiencies in my soil and liquid selections and can you make any suggestions?
[23:57.080 --> 24:03.160]  So we've got a good soil. We got nature's living soil. We got bud swell. We got recharge and we've got happy frog. I
[24:03.720 --> 24:07.620]  Am NOT absolutely certain of any of the organic
[24:08.540 --> 24:13.540]  Certifications of any of those products. I definitely don't know about recharge. I don't know about happy frog
[24:13.540 --> 24:19.340]  I think bud swell is organic, but I can't promise you that any of those are are actually organic products
[24:19.620 --> 24:26.140]  Look for an OMRI listing on the package. That's my advice there then bud swell. I do think that's organic. That's just bottled
[24:27.300 --> 24:33.860]  Fucking bat guano to the best of my knowledge. We got elementally green big buds. I don't know what that product is
[24:33.860 --> 24:38.660]  I did not research that one. Then we list two products that concern me right away turpenator. I
[24:39.540 --> 24:44.140]  Don't think I'm going to assume and we've talked about assuming once in this episode maybe twice
[24:44.260 --> 24:47.940]  I'm going to assume that turpenator is not an organic product
[24:47.940 --> 24:50.260]  It could be I could be completely fucking wrong
[24:50.260 --> 24:55.060]  But from what I remember what I see on that bottle when I'm looking at it through memory, that's not organic
[24:55.060 --> 24:58.860]  So you might want to read about that then you've got cow mag is your next liquid
[24:59.700 --> 25:02.980]  Which cow mag there are a lot of brands out there a lot of different products available
[25:03.100 --> 25:09.220]  Some may be organic, but it's gonna be hard to find a straight pure liquid organic cow mag solution
[25:09.220 --> 25:13.640]  I think I've never looked for a purely organic cow mag that could be a challenge
[25:13.640 --> 25:18.860]  So it depends on the brand make sure you're checking that OMRI listing for organics on your cow mag
[25:19.500 --> 25:23.780]  So the turpenator the cow mag those are the things that I would question
[25:23.980 --> 25:26.740]  Everything else you mentioned in here seems to make sense for your grow
[25:26.860 --> 25:31.460]  The only thing you're not the only goal you're not reaching is that complete organic desire
[25:31.460 --> 25:34.060]  I don't know that you're getting that with your list now
[25:34.060 --> 25:38.900]  I said this on the other talk about the outdoor grow that I saw on social media
[25:39.100 --> 25:44.420]  People are asking about what to grow with outdoors so they can stay completely organic which bottled nutrients should they buy?
[25:44.420 --> 25:47.340]  What product should they use? I'm gonna repeat what I said about that
[25:47.980 --> 25:51.900]  If you're going to grow completely organically and you don't want to do
[25:52.540 --> 25:54.100]  Salts and synthetic nutrients
[25:54.100 --> 26:00.920]  Why not just go with the full-on organic amended soil the way that nature would have done it go no-till go super soil
[26:01.040 --> 26:02.840]  Go something like that
[26:02.840 --> 26:08.100]  Get all of the things that would go into the dirt and get a big tarp and put it on the garage floor
[26:08.580 --> 26:10.580]  makes up a couple of bags of
[26:11.380 --> 26:15.300]  Whatever soil is available right now. Damn it soil and dirt are hard to get right now
[26:15.300 --> 26:20.300]  You guys I've been to the grow store a couple of grow stores to get products and soil is low
[26:20.300 --> 26:25.600]  But get the soilless mix the soil that you can get and then mix in all of the proper
[26:26.460 --> 26:30.140]  Amendments nutrients there are a lot of different ways to mix up a super soil
[26:30.140 --> 26:35.820]  I make this disclaimer often I do not claim to be an organic grower. I am NOT a super soil expert
[26:35.820 --> 26:39.100]  I could tell you the basics, but there are plenty of websites
[26:39.100 --> 26:43.260]  There are plenty of things on the internet that will get you building a great super soil
[26:43.260 --> 26:45.260]  They don't pay me to say it. They don't sponsor me
[26:45.820 --> 26:52.240]  But build a soil calm will be a great start for building an organic soil and amended soil
[26:52.340 --> 26:55.180]  So what I would do I'd skip all the bottles
[26:55.180 --> 26:58.800]  I would skip all this shit and I would mix up an amended super soil
[26:58.880 --> 27:04.560]  Some sort of build a soil some sort of ready mix soil that you could put those plants in then all you've got to feed
[27:04.560 --> 27:07.080]  Them is maybe a top dress between phases
[27:07.080 --> 27:10.220]  Maybe like at the end of veg give them a top dress right at the start of flower
[27:10.460 --> 27:14.500]  Top dress right as they start to bloom a specific top dress as they're going
[27:14.860 --> 27:19.960]  They're getting bigger. Give them a specific bloom booster top dress. I'm not the fucking organic guy
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.300]  So I don't know what to even tell you to top dress or tea teas would be a good idea feed them some teas
[27:24.660 --> 27:27.660]  But if you want to go completely organically and grow
[27:28.460 --> 27:33.540]  Organics and not have the bottles and all that stuff and be sure that everything you're using is organic. I would buy
[27:34.140 --> 27:39.840]  Amendments and mix up a good pre amended super soil. It's gonna save you it's gonna take time in the beginning
[27:39.840 --> 27:41.540]  You're gonna spend a day mixing it up
[27:41.540 --> 27:46.540]  But then you don't have to mix up nutrients every time you water and that's why to the outdoor growers
[27:46.540 --> 27:54.140]  Who are looking to do something organic outdoors and want to know what nutrients to use you're going to be watering every single day outdoors
[27:54.140 --> 27:57.900]  Do you want to spend the time to mix up you might water 20 gallons out there?
[27:57.900 --> 28:03.060]  Do you want to spend time mixing up 20 gallons of water worth of nutrients every single day?
[28:03.060 --> 28:07.460]  Or do you want to spend one or two days in the garage mixing up a big fat batch of super soil?
[28:07.540 --> 28:13.700]  Put your plants in that and then just water the whole cycle because all you've got to do is keep them wet because inside that soil
[28:13.700 --> 28:15.700]  Is everything that they need?
[28:16.260 --> 28:20.580]  Some of you organic growers insist that the herb tastes better gets you higher
[28:20.660 --> 28:24.460]  So if it's doing that it may be worth the pre-mix. I don't know the difference
[28:24.460 --> 28:27.980]  Honestly, I think it all gets me plenty stone nowadays. You guys are all growing such good weed
[28:28.580 --> 28:30.580]  But my advice
[28:30.660 --> 28:35.380]  Would be to ditch 90% of these products if you've already got them use them, dude
[28:35.380 --> 28:37.180]  Don't let me fuck up your plans your ideas
[28:37.180 --> 28:43.220]  But if you want to stay as organic as possible, I would abandon ship on all these liquid products and I would buy
[28:43.740 --> 28:48.820]  Powders boxes of stuff organic stuff when you go to the grow store when you go to the gardening store
[28:48.820 --> 28:52.500]  You'll see all the boxes that you need all the dry amendments. They're all in one area
[28:53.300 --> 28:56.160]  Maybe you'll go to build a soil. Maybe you'll go to your local grow shop
[28:56.160 --> 28:57.980]  I recommend you go to like the local
[28:57.980 --> 29:03.380]  Farm area the local farming store if you can if they're not gonna bust you for growing weed because sometimes
[29:03.700 --> 29:06.380]  Most people know what we're doing and they may not like the way you look
[29:06.780 --> 29:11.700]  So be careful where you're going but shop locally if you can is what I'm getting at give mom and pop the money try not
[29:11.700 --> 29:16.340]  To give the big boxes your money try not to give Amazon your money if possible. Trust me
[29:16.340 --> 29:19.460]  I order plenty of shit. I shop where I have to especially during a pandemic
[29:20.100 --> 29:21.100]  Give me what I need
[29:21.100 --> 29:21.460]  however
[29:21.460 --> 29:23.460]  the fuck I can get it but I
[29:23.540 --> 29:28.980]  would get away from the bottle and stuff if if you really want to be and you said I'm trying to be as
[29:29.260 --> 29:32.500]  Organic of a grower as possible, bro. I would really recommend
[29:33.260 --> 29:38.820]  No till growing for you. I would recommend super soil. I would recommend some type of living soil growing for you
[29:38.820 --> 29:40.220]  That's not how I do it
[29:40.220 --> 29:41.100]  That's not what I do
[29:41.100 --> 29:45.580]  But you're saying as organic as possible and that is how you get as organic as possible
[29:45.580 --> 29:49.380]  No till with a worm bin and fucking a compost pile
[29:49.980 --> 29:51.340]  It's really rewarding
[29:51.340 --> 29:56.460]  I eat a lot of vegetables and a lot of ends of vegetables end up in a Bokashi bucket and stuff and to know that
[29:56.460 --> 30:01.060]  I'm making fertilizer with my leftover food scraps. That's just rewarding
[30:01.060 --> 30:05.380]  So if you turn that into cannabis products, you're gonna love that. That's a good way to stay as
[30:05.980 --> 30:13.780]  Organic as possible. There are more questions to this one. It says what are some considerations to have when deciding to grow a mother plant?
[30:14.580 --> 30:16.980]  That's a really easy question. It's like falling in love
[30:17.340 --> 30:20.180]  If you're in love with that plant keep it and grow it as a mother plant
[30:20.180 --> 30:23.180]  I always recommend every time you grow a cannabis plant
[30:23.180 --> 30:29.340]  Take a clone like before you put a plant into flower get a clone because what you're growing could be the most amazing medicine
[30:29.340 --> 30:33.380]  You've ever grown it could work in your grow better than everything you've ever grown. It could work for your medicine
[30:33.380 --> 30:36.800]  I could work for your wallet. Maybe you're a commercial grower growing for profit
[30:36.800 --> 30:42.340]  Maybe this one plant works better than everything for you. Take a freaking clone of everything you ever grow
[30:42.700 --> 30:46.500]  Then if you find out that it's the hottest fire, you've got a mother plant
[30:46.500 --> 30:49.140]  That is how you decide to keep a mother plant if you fell in love with it
[30:50.140 --> 30:53.180]  Something that sounds very crass, but this is the absolute fucking truth
[30:53.180 --> 30:57.540]  It's a lot like the dating pool if you got one option, you're gonna keep that one
[30:57.540 --> 30:59.700]  You're gonna fall in love you'd be completely fucking happy
[30:59.700 --> 31:04.260]  But if you got a bunch to choose from the one that stands out to you will be the mother plant you want to keep
[31:04.260 --> 31:10.100]  Something will tell you it's just like falling in love with a person the way I fall in love with plants is very similar
[31:10.100 --> 31:15.020]  I see plants plants plants. Oh, look at that plant. That's just the way it happens to me
[31:15.500 --> 31:21.740]  Just like it does with people it's like people people people damn look at her like I'm just attracted to specific things and the plants
[31:21.740 --> 31:27.700]  Do it just like people do I get similar signals in my body that say that plant right there, bro
[31:27.700 --> 31:29.700]  That is the one you want to pick
[31:29.780 --> 31:32.820]  sometimes I'm wrong most of the time I'm right being a breeder being a
[31:33.740 --> 31:36.100]  Seed selector being a commercial cultivator
[31:36.100 --> 31:39.660]  I get to see a lot of plants and I get to make a lot of selections and I'm getting
[31:39.780 --> 31:44.700]  Pretty damn good at it. I think so considerations to have when deciding to grow a mother plant
[31:44.700 --> 31:49.860]  Is it a good plant did that plant work well for you? Did it meet all of your goals people ask me?
[31:49.860 --> 31:52.300]  What do I pick for a phenotype? What do you want, dude?
[31:52.580 --> 31:54.860]  Pick the shit that you want in your garden
[31:54.860 --> 31:58.220]  Did it smell the way you want it it tastes the way you want it to give you the buzz you want
[31:58.340 --> 32:02.180]  Did it flower and a timely manner did it work well for your growth?
[32:02.180 --> 32:05.100]  Did all the other plants in the room get powdery mildew except that one?
[32:05.100 --> 32:10.100]  Did all the other plants get hit by mites except that one did all the other plants harm out except that one?
[32:10.220 --> 32:14.900]  Where all the other plants like sevens, but this one's a nine that nine is your keeper mother plant, bro
[32:14.900 --> 32:19.060]  So as long as it's a good plant as long as it makes you happy and you want to grow it again and keep it
[32:19.060 --> 32:22.620]  Around that is a characteristic. I look for in a mother plant
[32:22.620 --> 32:27.420]  You're basically just preserving genetics to grow it over and over again. Do you love it? Does it work?
[32:27.420 --> 32:31.900]  Is it successful keep it for a mother plant then it says lastly as a grower
[32:32.500 --> 32:36.820]  How different how difficult is it to create an auto flower strain?
[32:36.820 --> 32:39.540]  I know autos are not necessarily your bag
[32:39.580 --> 32:46.340]  But I'm asking about what process would entail in general to create auto flower seeds. That's a good question
[32:46.340 --> 32:50.780]  I am NOT an auto flower maker. So everything I say right now is kind of
[32:51.300 --> 32:55.060]  Partially coming out of my ass just a little bit, but I know enough about breeding
[32:55.060 --> 32:59.100]  I know enough about seeds that I can cover this I feel like to make an auto flower
[32:59.100 --> 33:02.380]  You need an auto flower. You need at least one auto flower
[33:02.380 --> 33:08.100]  So get a pack of auto flower seeds would be the way to do that now because auto flowers you can't clone them
[33:08.100 --> 33:12.780]  They're gonna flower that clone is the same age as the original plant which it came from
[33:12.780 --> 33:15.180]  They're both gonna flower at the same time to the best of my understanding
[33:16.100 --> 33:19.820]  So you're gonna have to get a pack of auto flower seeds. I recommend
[33:20.220 --> 33:24.560]  Feminized auto flowers if you can get them, I think most of the people making them are doing fems right now
[33:24.560 --> 33:29.340]  So get you an auto flower feminized seed pack then grow them
[33:30.140 --> 33:31.620]  then
[33:31.660 --> 33:35.900]  To create an auto flower strain. So you need auto flower to fucking have auto flower
[33:35.900 --> 33:38.360]  You need that trait to start with you can't make
[33:39.460 --> 33:43.820]  Orange stuff without some orange. So you're gonna need an auto flower plant in the mix
[33:44.540 --> 33:48.260]  So get an auto flower plant and then get a regular plant and then you need to
[33:49.100 --> 33:52.820]  Select most of us are gonna get a feminized auto flower
[33:52.820 --> 33:57.540]  So you're gonna have to get pollen from a regular male plant and then pollinate your auto flowers
[33:57.620 --> 33:59.620]  Those auto flowers are gonna make seeds
[33:59.980 --> 34:05.940]  That is your f1 that's a real f1 you've got a brand new cross a fucking auto flower to a photo period
[34:06.100 --> 34:09.740]  You've just made a really unstable sloppy fucking crazy
[34:11.020 --> 34:14.100]  Really high in variation f1 find
[34:14.660 --> 34:19.540]  Two of those that auto flower you got to find a male and a female that auto flower at this point
[34:19.700 --> 34:22.580]  The only way you're gonna know is to grow them and they're going to auto flower
[34:22.900 --> 34:25.980]  So once you found the male and female that meet the criteria you want
[34:26.620 --> 34:32.180]  They've got the shape and structure aroma the traits you desire the leaf shape and whatnot for your goal
[34:32.900 --> 34:39.220]  They're auto flowering. You see them start to auto flower breed that male to that female now, you've got f2
[34:39.820 --> 34:45.700]  They're not going to carry that auto flower trait until we get to about f5 f6
[34:45.700 --> 34:49.180]  Maybe f7 so you're going to have to keep doing this process
[34:49.820 --> 34:55.180]  Grow the seeds out find a male and a female that begin to auto flower on you put them in a room
[34:55.260 --> 35:01.820]  Let them pollinate each other get the seeds out find grow those seeds and veg find plants that meet the criteria
[35:01.900 --> 35:06.140]  You're looking for plant shape plant structure stem rub smell
[35:06.740 --> 35:11.380]  Let them start flowering when they get into flower. Let that male pollinate that female
[35:11.380 --> 35:16.100]  We're probably at what now f2 f3 keep going until we get to f6 by then
[35:16.420 --> 35:21.460]  By then they should start coming out more uniform more uniform each time
[35:21.780 --> 35:25.980]  Another way you can do it is by reversing that auto flower, but that is a whole nother ballgame
[35:26.540 --> 35:31.660]  We're going to reverse the auto flower plant. It'll make pollen you put that pollen on another plant
[35:32.140 --> 35:38.020]  Hopefully a female that is auto flowering that's going to increase your chances of getting more auto flower more quickly
[35:38.660 --> 35:41.100]  Again, I am NOT an auto flower breeder
[35:41.100 --> 35:47.380]  I don't know exactly how many filial generations it would take to solidify that auto flower trait
[35:47.380 --> 35:50.620]  I think by selfing a couple of things you could probably lock it in
[35:51.380 --> 35:53.220]  Maybe back crossing or something
[35:53.220 --> 35:59.500]  But I think by going forward in filial generation and just finding auto flower trait auto flower trait auto flower trait
[35:59.500 --> 36:00.540]  That's gonna lock it in
[36:00.540 --> 36:06.460]  That's probably the best way to do it all the other traits have to be secondary at that point that in my opinion is
[36:06.620 --> 36:10.660]  Why a lot of people find that auto flowers are inferior
[36:11.180 --> 36:15.940]  Our first trait that we're searching for most of the time is potency and quality, right?
[36:15.940 --> 36:19.180]  We're going for potency turps then after that we think about
[36:20.020 --> 36:22.740]  Problems like is it resistant to bugs resistant to mildew?
[36:22.740 --> 36:23.580]  Does it handle the room?
[36:23.580 --> 36:27.180]  Well, but most of the time we go for potency and turps and auto flowers
[36:27.180 --> 36:30.100]  The main thing the main trait we're looking for is auto flower
[36:30.220 --> 36:35.380]  So everything else is secondary in my opinion take that with a grain of salt you guys because like I said
[36:35.460 --> 36:38.500]  I'm not the auto flower guy all of what I just said
[36:39.220 --> 36:43.740]  Came out my ass. All right. I tried to talk the best I could about that. I'm not an expert
[36:43.740 --> 36:47.440]  I feel like I'm knowledgeable. I understand plants. I understand breeding enough to have advice on that
[36:47.440 --> 36:50.960]  But again take that with the big stinky grain of salt. All right
[36:50.960 --> 36:56.200]  I feel like I've been going on for quite some time. This is a long podcast with very little information
[36:56.200 --> 36:59.320]  I do apologize for that. I feel like I talked a long time and did not teach you enough
