[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.320 --> 00:06.200]  It's time for episode 399 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.200 --> 00:09.000]  This episode is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.100]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can
[00:13.100 --> 00:19.040]  find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:19.040 --> 00:23.360]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:23.360 --> 00:27.820]  Today I've been taking dabs of banana wafer kush from Apothecary Farms.
[00:27.820 --> 00:36.260]  The label says that this concentrate contains 74.9% THC with a total of 89.6% total cannabinoids.
[00:36.260 --> 00:39.500]  I really enjoy the stony buzz from the banana wafer kush.
[00:39.500 --> 00:43.340]  It's got a great flavor, it's got a great texture, it's got a great consistency, and
[00:43.340 --> 00:45.580]  I really like the way it makes me feel.
[00:45.580 --> 00:51.660]  Big shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious banana wafer kush.
[00:51.660 --> 00:56.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I'm going to read a few more listener emails.
[00:56.020 --> 00:57.440]  Let's not waste a lot of time.
[00:58.060 --> 00:59.860]  Let's jump right into this first email.
[00:59.860 --> 01:01.560]  This first message goes like this.
[01:01.560 --> 01:02.560]  Hello, Jeff.
[01:02.560 --> 01:07.000]  First off, thank you so much for all of your work on the podcast, especially with the Grow
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.640]  Lessons because they have for the most part gone hand in hand with my very first room.
[01:12.640 --> 01:14.760]  That puts a smile on my face every time I hear it.
[01:14.760 --> 01:19.840]  It feels like my Grow Lessons were perfectly timed up with a lot of people's very first
[01:19.840 --> 01:21.520]  Grow, and that puts a smile on my face.
[01:21.520 --> 01:23.720]  I'm glad I was able to help so many people out.
[01:23.720 --> 01:26.920]  I hope I made your Grow experience less stressful.
[01:26.920 --> 01:29.960]  I hope I made it more fun and overall more enjoyable.
[01:29.960 --> 01:32.600]  So man, I'm glad I was able to help you out with that.
[01:32.600 --> 01:38.320]  Now the message goes on to say, I am using cocoa for my medium along with Success Nutrients.
[01:38.320 --> 01:42.080]  Success has recommended that I add their product called Sugar all the way through the final
[01:42.080 --> 01:43.280]  flush.
[01:43.280 --> 01:49.400]  My question is, is it necessary to do so during the final flush because I've heard conflicting
[01:49.400 --> 01:52.840]  views on it from those I get information from locally.
[01:52.840 --> 01:57.760]  One person even stated that cocoa needs something in the water for the plant to grab a hold
[01:57.760 --> 02:00.360]  of in order to drink properly.
[02:00.360 --> 02:04.080]  Thank you again for your time and I'll for sure give my mom a hug for you since she is
[02:04.080 --> 02:05.760]  in town on her vacation.
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.080]  Hey bro, I hope you and your mom had a great time during her vacation.
[02:10.080 --> 02:15.540]  Let's talk a little bit about Success Nutrients and flushing with cocoa.
[02:15.540 --> 02:19.760]  Now I generally don't find it necessary to use any nutrients or products during the flush
[02:19.760 --> 02:20.760]  phase.
[02:20.760 --> 02:24.000]  My goal is to clean out the medium so the plants will stop eating so that we can clean
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  them up so that when we dry and cure them, the buds taste delicious and they burn nice
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.360]  and smoothly.
[02:29.360 --> 02:33.160]  Now there has been a lot of controversy or a lot of conversation around the subject of
[02:33.160 --> 02:34.160]  flushing.
[02:34.160 --> 02:35.160]  Is it necessary?
[02:35.160 --> 02:36.160]  Does it do anything?
[02:36.160 --> 02:37.160]  Are we wasting our time?
[02:37.160 --> 02:39.680]  Could we be improving our plants a little by feeding longer?
[02:39.680 --> 02:40.680]  I'm learning a lot.
[02:40.680 --> 02:42.720]  There is still a lot of debate going on.
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.000]  Once I have made a decision on how I feel, I will share more information with you on
[02:47.000 --> 02:48.240]  the show.
[02:48.240 --> 02:52.720]  For this podcast, let's talk about the standard two week flush phase that most growers are
[02:52.720 --> 02:54.040]  familiar with.
[02:54.040 --> 02:58.600]  Like I said a moment ago, I generally don't find it necessary to add any nutrients during
[02:58.600 --> 03:03.160]  the flush phase unless you've had problems during the grow or unless you know you were
[03:03.160 --> 03:04.720]  feeding excessively.
[03:04.720 --> 03:07.320]  I really push my plants to the limits.
[03:07.320 --> 03:11.480]  Sometimes during the flush phase, I'll use an enzyme just to help clean up that soil,
[03:11.480 --> 03:15.340]  but most of the time I'm just adding water, just clean water.
[03:15.340 --> 03:17.300]  Sometimes I pH, sometimes I don't.
[03:17.300 --> 03:20.880]  That will be a part of the conversation I have in the future when I talk about my new
[03:20.880 --> 03:22.300]  ideas about flushing.
[03:22.300 --> 03:23.740]  Again, I'm still learning.
[03:23.740 --> 03:28.340]  I don't want to teach anything until I have a solid grasp on my new learnings.
[03:28.340 --> 03:30.740]  So when we're flushing, we're trying to clean out the medium.
[03:30.740 --> 03:32.480]  We don't want the plants to eat anything.
[03:32.480 --> 03:33.480]  That is our main goal.
[03:33.480 --> 03:36.140]  We want to starve them just before harvest.
[03:36.140 --> 03:40.820]  Now the product that was recommended is called Sugar, which in my mind automatically led
[03:40.820 --> 03:45.060]  me to believe that this was some sort of a sweetener product, which I could understand
[03:45.060 --> 03:49.580]  why a company would recommend a sweetener product toward the end of flower.
[03:49.580 --> 03:50.580]  But I did some research.
[03:50.580 --> 03:55.420]  I went to the Success Nutrients website and I did research on their product called Sugar.
[03:55.420 --> 03:58.260]  And sugar is actually not sugars.
[03:58.260 --> 04:01.580]  Sugar is actually high in sulfur and magnesium.
[04:01.580 --> 04:05.460]  Now if you understand plant biology, you understand why these elements are good for the plants
[04:05.460 --> 04:10.980]  and why they may be recommended late in flower, but they are not necessary at this stage of
[04:10.980 --> 04:12.020]  the game.
[04:12.020 --> 04:18.180]  I don't find it necessary to feed high amounts of sulfur and magnesium this late in flower,
[04:18.180 --> 04:19.580]  but it won't be detrimental.
[04:19.580 --> 04:22.340]  It wouldn't cause a problem if you did.
[04:22.340 --> 04:26.220]  Unless you're really overdosing these products, I don't think you're going to notice it in
[04:26.220 --> 04:28.340]  the flavor of the final product.
[04:28.340 --> 04:29.940]  It may increase trichomes.
[04:29.940 --> 04:31.860]  It may increase resin production.
[04:31.860 --> 04:34.540]  It may increase that final bulk.
[04:34.540 --> 04:36.820]  But also it may not do much at all.
[04:36.820 --> 04:41.740]  This could be just simply a sales tactic for a nutrient company to sell you a little bit
[04:41.740 --> 04:43.340]  more of a product.
[04:43.340 --> 04:46.340]  I did not look at the price of this product by the description.
[04:46.340 --> 04:50.780]  By the look of the website, I assume this is a pretty pricey product.
[04:50.780 --> 04:51.780]  So is it necessary?
[04:51.780 --> 04:52.780]  No.
[04:52.780 --> 04:56.820]  It is not necessary to add anything to your flush when you are flushing your plants for
[04:56.820 --> 05:00.740]  the last week, 10 days, 2 weeks, however you decide to do it.
[05:00.740 --> 05:04.380]  It is not necessary to add any product to the flush in cocoa.
[05:04.380 --> 05:09.800]  You can flush with just plain water and it is optional if you even pH that water during
[05:09.800 --> 05:11.620]  your flush phase.
[05:11.700 --> 05:16.500]  If you have already purchased this product called Sugar and you have more than one plant
[05:16.500 --> 05:20.580]  and you're not running a hydro system, if you are able to feed your plants different
[05:20.580 --> 05:25.820]  nutrient regimens, here is a suggestion to have a little fun with this product and this
[05:25.820 --> 05:27.220]  product line.
[05:27.220 --> 05:32.300]  What I would recommend is select one plant or maybe select half of your plants.
[05:32.300 --> 05:33.300]  Choose however many you want.
[05:33.300 --> 05:34.340]  This is your grow.
[05:34.340 --> 05:37.220]  You need to do this experiment to where it works best for you.
[05:37.700 --> 05:42.900]  Select at least one plant and feed it the recommended amount of this product all the
[05:42.900 --> 05:44.260]  way through the flush phase.
[05:44.260 --> 05:45.260]  Write it on that plant.
[05:45.260 --> 05:48.420]  I am feeding this plant sugar all the way through.
[05:48.420 --> 05:49.960]  Write it down.
[05:49.960 --> 05:50.960]  Mark that plant.
[05:50.960 --> 05:54.880]  Then take another plant and don't feed it sugar through the flush phase and mark it.
[05:54.880 --> 05:57.280]  This one did not get fed sugar through the flush phase.
[05:57.280 --> 06:01.060]  Make sure they're clearly marked and don't fuck it up during the last 2 weeks of bloom.
[06:01.060 --> 06:02.720]  Don't feed one the wrong mix.
[06:02.720 --> 06:05.340]  So feed the one sugar for the last 2 weeks.
[06:05.340 --> 06:07.460]  Don't feed the one sugar for the last 2 weeks.
[06:07.460 --> 06:09.120]  Cut them down.
[06:09.120 --> 06:12.040]  Make sure that tag stays with them so you know which is which.
[06:12.040 --> 06:15.480]  Make that tag stay with them all the way up until the moment you smoke them.
[06:15.480 --> 06:20.000]  So you want to cut them down, dry them, cure them, trim them out the way you normally do.
[06:20.000 --> 06:21.800]  Treat them just like you normally would.
[06:21.800 --> 06:25.760]  Both of them need to be treated exactly the same if you want this experiment to be valid
[06:25.760 --> 06:26.880]  at all.
[06:26.880 --> 06:29.040]  So don't feed the product to one.
[06:29.040 --> 06:30.800]  Feed the product to another.
[06:30.800 --> 06:32.500]  Harvest them the way you normally do.
[06:32.500 --> 06:34.200]  Process them the way you normally do.
[06:34.420 --> 06:36.420]  Consume them the way you normally do.
[06:36.420 --> 06:37.420]  And take note.
[06:37.420 --> 06:39.100]  Do you notice any difference?
[06:39.100 --> 06:41.900]  Some things you may want to compare are harvest weight.
[06:41.900 --> 06:45.120]  Does the one you fed the sugar, is it a little heavier toward the end?
[06:45.120 --> 06:48.680]  Because you've been giving it more product, maybe it packed on a little bit more weight.
[06:48.680 --> 06:50.200]  You're paying for something in that bottle.
[06:50.200 --> 06:52.480]  They say that there is sulfur and magnesium in there.
[06:52.480 --> 06:58.040]  So that sulfur and magnesium better be converting to something tangible, something quantifiable
[06:58.040 --> 06:59.100]  on that plant.
[06:59.100 --> 07:02.600]  Something you should be able to see or measure in some sort of way because that product is
[07:02.600 --> 07:03.780]  costing you money.
[07:03.780 --> 07:05.400]  So is it doing something in the end?
[07:05.400 --> 07:06.520]  That's what we want to see.
[07:06.520 --> 07:11.120]  Do you have more harvest weight or do you have more trichome density?
[07:11.120 --> 07:14.560]  That is something we could all desire is more trichome density.
[07:14.560 --> 07:19.560]  Did you get frostier buds by using the product for the last two weeks of flower?
[07:19.560 --> 07:22.920]  Maybe something else to pay attention to is how does it look visually?
[07:22.920 --> 07:23.920]  Did your plants burn?
[07:23.920 --> 07:25.360]  Did they start to look like shit?
[07:25.360 --> 07:27.320]  Did they look really healthy all the way through?
[07:27.320 --> 07:30.120]  Did they show you any visible differences?
[07:30.120 --> 07:32.540]  That's something that you can pay attention to as a grower.
[07:32.540 --> 07:34.180]  That's something you can learn from.
[07:34.180 --> 07:36.280]  The next test we get to do is the best test.
[07:36.280 --> 07:37.880]  It is the smoke test.
[07:37.880 --> 07:40.760]  You have properly dried and cured and processed your product.
[07:40.760 --> 07:43.080]  You handled both batches exactly the same.
[07:43.080 --> 07:46.280]  Now let's roll one up or let's pack up a bowl, however you do it.
[07:46.280 --> 07:49.160]  Again, please don't put this sample batch in a blunt wrap.
[07:49.160 --> 07:52.720]  You can't get a scientific result from smoking it out of a toilet paper tube.
[07:52.720 --> 07:54.100]  It's not going to work for you.
[07:54.100 --> 07:56.680]  Let's use something glass or a thin paper.
[07:56.680 --> 07:58.280]  Let's be scientific about it.
[07:58.280 --> 07:59.760]  Anyway, let's roll one up.
[07:59.760 --> 08:02.000]  Let's pack up a bowl and see how it burns.
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.260]  The one that you fed for the extra two weeks, does it burn funky?
[08:05.260 --> 08:06.260]  Does it taste different?
[08:06.260 --> 08:07.320]  Is the ash chunky?
[08:07.320 --> 08:08.320]  Is it gross to you?
[08:08.320 --> 08:09.320]  Does it burn your throat?
[08:09.320 --> 08:10.320]  Does it burn your lips?
[08:10.320 --> 08:11.980]  Does the high give you a headache?
[08:11.980 --> 08:13.800]  Is it different in any way?
[08:13.800 --> 08:17.320]  Is that product that you flushed for two weeks, is it nice and smooth?
[08:17.320 --> 08:18.320]  Does it make you choke?
[08:18.320 --> 08:19.320]  Does it make you cough?
[08:19.320 --> 08:22.200]  Is the high different than the other one in any way?
[08:22.200 --> 08:23.200]  Compare the two.
[08:23.200 --> 08:26.920]  Maybe smoke one, the first smoke today, try one of them.
[08:26.920 --> 08:29.480]  Then your first smoke tomorrow, try one of them.
[08:29.480 --> 08:31.200]  Then just alternate for a couple of days.
[08:31.400 --> 08:34.080]  Maybe stick with one for a whole day, stick with another one for a whole day.
[08:34.080 --> 08:37.640]  You can actually get a real result from your product.
[08:37.640 --> 08:41.480]  That's the only way you can tell if they are just trying to sell you something so that
[08:41.480 --> 08:45.280]  you spend more money or if it is actually going to make a difference in your grow, in
[08:45.280 --> 08:47.920]  your environment, in your situation.
[08:47.920 --> 08:52.040]  The short answer is no, it is not necessary to apply that product late in flower.
[08:52.040 --> 08:55.440]  But the fun answer is, since you've already got it, let's apply it to some plants and
[08:55.440 --> 08:56.440]  not others.
[08:56.440 --> 08:59.900]  Let's do a little bit of an experiment and let's find out for ourselves what we're getting
[09:00.020 --> 09:01.540]  out of this product.
[09:01.540 --> 09:04.100]  And honestly, that's really the only fair way to judge a product.
[09:04.100 --> 09:05.900]  You can't judge it just by reading a label.
[09:05.900 --> 09:07.540]  You can't judge it by what you hear.
[09:07.540 --> 09:12.140]  This is the best way to make a real decision, a real judgment on any product is to experiment
[09:12.140 --> 09:13.140]  with it.
[09:13.140 --> 09:16.580]  Do a controlled experiment and find out for yourself what you think about that product
[09:16.580 --> 09:18.260]  in your grow.
[09:18.260 --> 09:21.400]  Some things that work for your bros aren't going to work for you and some things that
[09:21.400 --> 09:24.460]  work for you aren't going to work for your bros.
[09:24.460 --> 09:29.860]  Very small differences in a grow environment will make large differences in the final outcome.
[09:29.860 --> 09:34.780]  Every little spoke will make a difference in the way that wheel rolls in the final product.
[09:34.780 --> 09:38.560]  So again, the only way you can give a fair assessment, a fair judgment is to run the
[09:38.560 --> 09:40.600]  trial on your own.
[09:40.600 --> 09:45.040]  As for the person who said that cocoa needs something in the water for the plant to grab
[09:45.040 --> 09:49.720]  a hold of the water to drink properly, I would like to know more information about what they
[09:49.720 --> 09:55.140]  are saying there because when there are roots exposed to water and the plant is thirsty,
[09:55.140 --> 09:56.140]  it will drink.
[09:56.140 --> 10:02.280]  I've flushed countless plants in cocoa in large facilities without anything in the water
[10:02.280 --> 10:04.420]  and they flushed just fine.
[10:04.420 --> 10:09.180]  I've got great lab results, the product tastes great, I've got huge harvest weights and everybody
[10:09.180 --> 10:11.380]  is satisfied with the final product.
[10:11.380 --> 10:15.300]  And again, there was just water in that final flush for 10 days.
[10:15.300 --> 10:18.880]  So to wrap that one up, I encourage you to run the experiment and when you do, I look
[10:18.880 --> 10:22.100]  forward to the report from the results of that experiment.
[10:22.100 --> 10:24.420]  All right, I want to thank you for the great email.
[10:24.420 --> 10:27.060]  I'm going to move right into the next message.
[10:27.060 --> 10:29.220]  This one's a little shorter and it goes like this.
[10:29.220 --> 10:30.260]  Hello, sir.
[10:30.260 --> 10:31.260]  How formal of you.
[10:31.260 --> 10:32.260]  Thank you for the great greeting.
[10:32.260 --> 10:36.060]  It says, first and foremost, dude, we went from sir to dude really quickly here.
[10:36.060 --> 10:37.060]  This just got comfortable.
[10:37.060 --> 10:39.340]  Thank you very much for the knowledge you shared.
[10:39.340 --> 10:40.340]  Dude, you are very welcome.
[10:40.340 --> 10:41.700]  Thank you for the hilarious email.
[10:41.700 --> 10:43.380]  I'm having fun with this one already.
[10:43.380 --> 10:47.140]  He goes on to say, I can't begin to tell you the difference in before I started listening
[10:47.140 --> 10:48.140]  and after.
[10:48.140 --> 10:50.100]  That means a lot that you're learning stuff from me.
[10:50.100 --> 10:51.840]  It makes it worth my time and energy.
[10:51.840 --> 10:53.100]  So thank you for that.
[10:53.100 --> 10:55.620]  Now the question is, I also wanted to ask you a question.
[10:55.620 --> 10:58.740]  Do you put your plants into a dark period before harvest?
[10:58.740 --> 11:01.260]  And if so, how long?
[11:01.260 --> 11:07.340]  So this question is asking if I give my plants a dark period before harvest, it is not uncommon
[11:07.340 --> 11:12.420]  for a lot of growers to leave their plants in the dark for 24 or maybe 48 or I've even
[11:12.420 --> 11:16.460]  heard 72 hours in the dark before harvesting their plants.
[11:16.460 --> 11:21.900]  In a small personal grow environment, yes, I do practice the dark cycle before harvest.
[11:21.900 --> 11:23.580]  This has several benefits.
[11:23.580 --> 11:27.220]  Unfortunately it is not feasible in many commercial environments.
[11:27.220 --> 11:31.640]  In a lot of commercial environments, I've got a very large room with multiple lights
[11:31.640 --> 11:36.220]  in there, sometimes a hundred lights in one room, sometimes 200 lights in one room.
[11:36.220 --> 11:41.300]  There's one building we work in that has 500 lights in one room and instead of having separate
[11:41.300 --> 11:46.640]  sections, we just load tables with plants, one table every two weeks gets cycled out.
[11:46.640 --> 11:50.500]  So there is not the opportunity to change the lights in that room because we've got
[11:50.620 --> 11:53.700]  more plants in there that rely on the schedule.
[11:53.700 --> 11:57.220]  So we can't manipulate the light cycle in some of the larger facilities.
[11:57.220 --> 12:02.900]  But like I said, in a small personal grow, yes, I do implement the dark cycle before
[12:02.900 --> 12:04.220]  harvest.
[12:04.220 --> 12:06.260]  This has many benefits.
[12:06.260 --> 12:08.860]  First, it's great for your electrical bill.
[12:08.860 --> 12:10.460]  You're saving electricity.
[12:10.460 --> 12:11.460]  That's a whole day.
[12:11.460 --> 12:12.460]  You're not running the gear.
[12:12.460 --> 12:16.340]  That's 12 hours at least of electricity you're not paying for.
[12:16.340 --> 12:19.520]  That's also 12 hours on your bulb that your bulb is going to live.
[12:19.520 --> 12:23.000]  That's also 12 hours on your ballast that your ballast will live.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.080]  It's possibly also 12 more hours on a couple of blowers and air conditioners.
[12:28.080 --> 12:32.120]  Now I know that just sounds like 12 hours of electricity, but over a year or two and
[12:32.120 --> 12:37.280]  in a couple of rooms with multiple lights, that 12 hours over two or three days will
[12:37.280 --> 12:38.500]  add up.
[12:38.500 --> 12:44.120]  In today's cannabis market, black market or legal, prices are dropping.
[12:44.120 --> 12:47.580]  So every dollar will count at this point.
[12:47.640 --> 12:50.620]  Our first advantage is we are saving electricity.
[12:50.620 --> 12:52.660]  Now let's talk about the plants.
[12:52.660 --> 12:55.900]  While they are in the dark, the plants are just swelling up a little bit.
[12:55.900 --> 12:56.980]  The plants are just growing.
[12:56.980 --> 13:00.160]  They grow in the dark and they absorb light energy during the day.
[13:00.160 --> 13:03.020]  They suck in all that light during the day and when they go to sleep, that's when they
[13:03.020 --> 13:04.020]  grow.
[13:04.020 --> 13:05.020]  They're just like a little kid.
[13:05.020 --> 13:06.020]  They grow in their sleep.
[13:06.020 --> 13:09.900]  So we're going to give them a nice long nap so that they can bulk out and they can grow
[13:09.900 --> 13:11.900]  a little bit in their sleep.
[13:11.900 --> 13:16.160]  Also the trichomes kind of seem to mature a little bit in that dark period.
[13:16.240 --> 13:20.040]  So I think they'll ripen up a little bit more if we leave them in that dark period.
[13:20.040 --> 13:24.920]  They also feel like they get a little more dense in that final dark period.
[13:24.920 --> 13:29.440]  Now I should add that sometimes that is strain specific.
[13:29.440 --> 13:35.040]  More tropical, skinny leaf, sativa cultivars may not enjoy that dark period as much as
[13:35.040 --> 13:39.640]  your chunky, thick, indica dominant, white leaf type varietals.
[13:39.640 --> 13:45.500]  So if you do choose to stick some plants in the dark for a 24, 36, 48, 72 hour period,
[13:45.500 --> 13:47.720]  I suggest you check on them.
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.300]  Don't be afraid just to open the door long enough to inspect your plants.
[13:51.300 --> 13:52.300]  Give them a look.
[13:52.300 --> 13:54.300]  If you've got a scope, go check out the trichomes.
[13:54.300 --> 13:55.820]  You might want to give them a little squeeze.
[13:55.820 --> 13:56.820]  See how they feel on density.
[13:56.820 --> 13:59.260]  Don't go touching them all over because that's just going to ruin the point.
[13:59.260 --> 14:01.420]  We want to get the trichomes nice and mature.
[14:01.420 --> 14:03.300]  Don't go rupture the trichomes with your fingers.
[14:03.300 --> 14:05.740]  Don't go steal all the essential oils with your fingers.
[14:05.740 --> 14:06.740]  Just touch them in one spot.
[14:06.740 --> 14:07.760]  Give them a squeeze.
[14:07.760 --> 14:08.940]  See how they feel.
[14:08.940 --> 14:10.340]  Give them a visual look.
[14:10.340 --> 14:12.860]  Are they getting funky from being in the dark too long?
[14:12.860 --> 14:16.100]  Did you water them and then move them to the dark and close them up in a room that
[14:16.100 --> 14:19.260]  doesn't have enough air flow and now you've got mildew happening?
[14:19.260 --> 14:21.580]  Pay attention to stuff like that.
[14:21.580 --> 14:23.500]  Smell your fingers after you squeeze the buds.
[14:23.500 --> 14:24.940]  See if it still smells good.
[14:24.940 --> 14:27.580]  Is the smell getting better or worse?
[14:27.580 --> 14:31.240]  Are you happy with what is happening while those plants are left in the dark?
[14:31.240 --> 14:33.700]  If you're happy with what's happening, leave them in there.
[14:33.700 --> 14:38.860]  Also, keep it kind of cool in that dark room because that's going to lead to my next part.
[14:38.860 --> 14:43.660]  Another big advantage to keeping our plants in the dark for several hours before harvest
[14:43.660 --> 14:47.060]  is the light degrades terpenes.
[14:47.060 --> 14:50.100]  Light and heat starts cooking off our terpenes.
[14:50.100 --> 14:54.380]  So if we've got them in the dark, in the cool, we can develop more terps in our plants right
[14:54.380 --> 14:55.740]  before harvest.
[14:55.740 --> 14:59.620]  The dark and the cool are best for trichomes and terpenes.
[14:59.620 --> 15:00.720]  And that's what we are after.
[15:00.720 --> 15:02.220]  We want essential oils.
[15:02.220 --> 15:03.500]  We want those terpenes.
[15:03.500 --> 15:05.680]  We want the best quality product we can get.
[15:05.680 --> 15:09.280]  The dark is the best environment for that preservation.
[15:09.280 --> 15:11.800]  The dark, cool environment is the best.
[15:11.800 --> 15:14.960]  Warm and moist starts ruining our product.
[15:14.960 --> 15:19.940]  So yes, the short answer is yes, I do like a dark period before harvest.
[15:19.940 --> 15:23.700]  The how long kind of depends on how much space I've got.
[15:23.700 --> 15:26.560]  Do I have a space I can utilize for this dark period?
[15:26.560 --> 15:28.520]  Do I have more plants coming along?
[15:28.520 --> 15:31.260]  Also, what type of plant am I growing?
[15:31.260 --> 15:35.000]  Some of this is going to be a trial and error sort of a thing.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.480]  Like I said earlier, your wider leaf, more beefy, chunky, more dense indica varieties
[15:40.480 --> 15:42.240]  are going to like this a little bit more.
[15:42.240 --> 15:45.740]  The tropical sativas may not respond as well to this.
[15:45.740 --> 15:49.800]  What I would suggest is you take the strain you were working with, and if you've got multiple
[15:49.800 --> 15:52.540]  plants, put one in the dark for 24 hours.
[15:52.540 --> 15:55.400]  Get another one, put it in the dark for 48 hours.
[15:55.400 --> 15:58.080]  Get another one, put it in the dark for 72 hours.
[15:58.080 --> 16:01.240]  I guess you're going to have to do that backwards because the longer one's got to go in first,
[16:01.240 --> 16:03.040]  but you get my point.
[16:03.080 --> 16:07.320]  So, take three plants in the dark for different intervals and see if there are any noticeable
[16:07.320 --> 16:09.680]  differences in your final product.
[16:09.680 --> 16:11.160]  You may see differences.
[16:11.160 --> 16:15.000]  Did the trichomes develop a little more density on that one you left in the dark longer?
[16:15.000 --> 16:16.540]  Did one get more dense?
[16:16.540 --> 16:18.160]  Did one smell better?
[16:18.160 --> 16:19.560]  Did one start to get funky?
[16:19.560 --> 16:21.080]  Did one just start to die?
[16:21.080 --> 16:23.400]  Did one degrade too quickly in the dark?
[16:23.400 --> 16:27.240]  Pay attention to the plants, pay attention to the trichomes, pay attention to the leaves.
[16:27.240 --> 16:32.220]  Again, give them a squeeze, smell your fingers, smell the buds up close, use a scope if you've
[16:32.220 --> 16:33.320]  got one.
[16:33.320 --> 16:38.400]  Do a little personal science experiment to find out what works best for you and your
[16:38.400 --> 16:40.000]  specific cultivar.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.940]  I would like to be able to give you more guidance on things like this, but sometimes, a lot
[16:43.940 --> 16:49.820]  of times, these things are very plant specific, very strain specific, very cultivar specific
[16:49.820 --> 16:51.140]  at a lot of times.
[16:51.140 --> 16:55.620]  So it's hard to tell you exactly what to do because I'm not sure where your plant is from,
[16:55.620 --> 16:57.780]  I'm not sure how your plant's going to react.
[16:57.780 --> 17:00.980]  There are a lot of variables that could happen in the grow.
[17:00.980 --> 17:06.060]  So to wrap that one up, yes, I do like a dark period, somewhere between 24 and 72 hours,
[17:06.060 --> 17:08.500]  depending on the availability of space.
[17:08.500 --> 17:11.660]  Also plant dependent, strain dependent.
[17:11.660 --> 17:15.140]  Another thing to think about is environment in your dark room.
[17:15.140 --> 17:18.380]  If you're just throwing those plants in a closet like some people do, you need some
[17:18.380 --> 17:20.140]  sort of airflow in there.
[17:20.140 --> 17:23.820]  Imagine you just watered your plants, you lock them in a closet, you close the door,
[17:23.820 --> 17:26.020]  all that humidity and moisture has to go somewhere.
[17:26.020 --> 17:28.060]  You've got big, fat, chunky buds in there.
[17:28.060 --> 17:30.860]  You're going to create mold on your finished buds.
[17:30.860 --> 17:33.620]  It's the last 48 hours and you just ruined it.
[17:33.620 --> 17:35.320]  Have some airflow in there.
[17:35.320 --> 17:39.380]  Don't set yourself up for failure at the end of the grow.
[17:39.380 --> 17:43.940]  And another thing to keep in mind is these plants are going to be stinky at this point
[17:43.940 --> 17:45.060]  in time.
[17:45.060 --> 17:50.700]  Wherever you trap them for this 24, 48 or 72 hour dark period, when you open it up,
[17:50.700 --> 17:52.920]  it is going to be pungent.
[17:52.920 --> 17:56.160]  Maybe be prepared for some type of odor control.
[17:56.160 --> 17:59.420]  Maybe don't do this on a time when you're expecting company.
[17:59.420 --> 18:04.060]  Maybe if you live really close to your neighbors, have some sort of odor control, odor prevention
[18:04.060 --> 18:08.500]  in place before this harvest time comes.
[18:08.500 --> 18:13.280]  Harvest is the stinkiest part of the entire grow process and it is about to start when
[18:13.280 --> 18:15.980]  you put these plants into the dark phase.
[18:15.980 --> 18:20.220]  All right, so that is my rant on putting plants into the dark before harvest.
[18:20.220 --> 18:22.860]  I want to thank you again for the great email.
[18:22.860 --> 18:27.500]  Now let's move on to one more email before we start wrapping up this podcast.
[18:27.500 --> 18:31.740]  This email goes like this, Hey Jeff, my name is, and I'm going to skip his name, but then
[18:31.740 --> 18:32.740]  it continues.
[18:32.740 --> 18:37.360]  I'm from Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I follow your podcast and Instagram.
[18:37.360 --> 18:41.840]  I've been growing with my PPL now for about two and a half years, and that's a personal
[18:41.840 --> 18:42.980]  production license.
[18:42.980 --> 18:47.020]  If I remember correctly down there in New Mexico, you have to get a personal production
[18:47.020 --> 18:48.020]  license.
[18:48.020 --> 18:49.020]  You have to get allowed by your landlord.
[18:49.020 --> 18:52.280]  There are a lot of steps to be able to have a home grow in New Mexico.
[18:52.280 --> 18:55.340]  So big shout out to this guy for making the steps and getting it done.
[18:55.340 --> 18:58.220]  He continues to say, you're doing an awesome job with your podcast.
[18:58.220 --> 18:59.300]  Hey, thank you a lot, bro.
[18:59.300 --> 19:00.300]  That means a lot to me.
[19:00.300 --> 19:04.100]  He says, I like listening in the morning before work and on the way to work with very good
[19:04.100 --> 19:05.100]  information.
[19:05.100 --> 19:07.780]  I still have some Raphael seeds I need to pop.
[19:07.780 --> 19:10.380]  I have a question about vegging my plants.
[19:10.380 --> 19:12.260]  What is too long to veg your plants?
[19:12.260 --> 19:14.780]  Is eight to nine weeks too long to veg?
[19:14.780 --> 19:17.900]  I'm trying to get my plants big for a nice yield.
[19:17.900 --> 19:21.860]  I know the older the plants get, the more prone they are to pests and diseases.
[19:21.860 --> 19:26.420]  My veg tent is pretty small, about four feet tall, and my flower tent is about six feet
[19:26.420 --> 19:27.420]  tall.
[19:27.420 --> 19:30.180]  Thank you in advance and keep rocking the podcasts.
[19:30.180 --> 19:34.500]  Hey dude, thanks for all the great compliments in there and thanks for listening to the show.
[19:34.500 --> 19:37.820]  Let's talk a little bit about veg times.
[19:37.820 --> 19:41.500]  You can veg your plants as long as you want, as long as works for you.
[19:41.500 --> 19:45.620]  You did say in the message that you know older plants get more prone to pests and diseases.
[19:45.620 --> 19:49.660]  You know, as long as you take care of the plants, they aren't very prone to pests or
[19:49.660 --> 19:50.660]  diseases.
[19:50.660 --> 19:55.300]  A lot of the new strains are bred with resistant genetics, so hopefully you've got some stuff
[19:55.300 --> 20:00.180]  that's been bred by a reputable breeder that isn't really prone to getting pests and diseases.
[20:00.180 --> 20:04.780]  The reason we talk about vegging quickly and flowering early to get away from the pests
[20:04.780 --> 20:09.300]  and diseases is because people simply bring problems to the grow.
[20:09.300 --> 20:12.540]  It's not that the plants themselves are prone to getting a disease.
[20:12.540 --> 20:17.580]  It's that we just want to minimize the time for a new grower having a garden to minimize
[20:17.580 --> 20:19.280]  the risk of any trouble.
[20:19.280 --> 20:23.680]  If it's law enforcement, if it's pests, if it's a plant disease, we want the quickness
[20:23.680 --> 20:28.400]  just to prevent a problem because the grower usually brings the problems himself.
[20:28.400 --> 20:32.240]  Now I'm going to give you some respect as a grower and say that you are on top of your
[20:32.240 --> 20:36.600]  integrated pest management system and you will not be bringing pests and pathogens into
[20:36.600 --> 20:41.320]  your grow, so you should be able to veg your plants as long as you need to without any
[20:41.320 --> 20:42.320]  problems.
[20:42.320 --> 20:47.080]  Now you do go on to say that your veg space is four feet tall and your flower tent is
[20:47.080 --> 20:49.000]  about six feet tall.
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.800]  Keep in mind that when you put your plants into flower, they do have the potential to
[20:52.800 --> 20:54.560]  double in size.
[20:54.560 --> 20:56.280]  You said you wanted to veg.
[20:56.280 --> 20:59.800]  You asked if eight or nine weeks was too long to veg.
[20:59.800 --> 21:04.800]  You were probably going to have quite tall plants by the end of eight weeks of veg.
[21:04.800 --> 21:06.160]  That's about 60 days.
[21:06.160 --> 21:12.240]  I generally veg a smaller plant in a tent for about 30 days before I put it into flower.
[21:12.240 --> 21:17.800]  Maybe, maybe 45 days at the most because they tend to get a little tall in the grow tents,
[21:17.800 --> 21:19.720]  especially if you need to leave room for the light.
[21:19.720 --> 21:23.400]  I'm not sure what type of light you're running, but we do need a gap between the light and
[21:23.400 --> 21:25.880]  the tops of the buds because we don't want to burn them.
[21:25.880 --> 21:30.160]  And that optimal light space is just a little distance away from the actual bulbs.
[21:30.160 --> 21:32.800]  So keep that in mind when you are vegging.
[21:32.800 --> 21:38.160]  Now if you're going outdoors, you can veg those plants as big as you want or need them
[21:38.160 --> 21:39.160]  to be.
[21:39.160 --> 21:45.480]  It is not uncommon for people to start cracking seeds in January or December or even earlier
[21:45.480 --> 21:48.520]  than that for a California outdoor style grow.
[21:48.520 --> 21:50.560]  You'll crack your seeds around Thanksgiving.
[21:50.560 --> 21:54.080]  You'll run a little crop from those seeds, find your females out of there.
[21:54.080 --> 21:58.760]  Then you will take clones of those good females and you'll start vegging them in January.
[21:58.760 --> 22:03.240]  You'll veg them all through February, veg them through March under lights indoors, under
[22:03.240 --> 22:05.360]  a thousand watt lights indoors.
[22:05.360 --> 22:07.560]  So we're getting giant beefy plants.
[22:07.560 --> 22:10.440]  Veg them through April, top them a bunch of times.
[22:10.440 --> 22:15.760]  And in May in California, the end of May, you can put them outdoors and they get gigantic.
[22:15.760 --> 22:20.600]  That's how you see those big 12 and 20 foot tall cannabis plants as they were vegged indoors
[22:20.600 --> 22:23.560]  for several months before they were put outside.
[22:23.560 --> 22:28.640]  So in theory, as long as you are not restricted by space, you can veg those plants to be monsters.
[22:28.640 --> 22:32.280]  If you've got a big enough pot to sustain your root ball, if you're able to have enough
[22:32.280 --> 22:37.080]  ceiling space, if you're outdoors, you can veg those plants unlimited as long as you
[22:37.080 --> 22:40.640]  are able to sustain their root ball and the plant health.
[22:40.640 --> 22:44.760]  In an indoor environment, you're basically limited by light height or ceiling height
[22:44.760 --> 22:48.960]  or whatever type of height or width or size restrictions you've got indoors.
[22:48.960 --> 22:49.960]  You can veg a plant.
[22:49.960 --> 22:54.520]  If you've got a trellis, you could probably fill a 25 by 25 room with one plant if you
[22:54.520 --> 22:55.520]  were super patient.
[22:55.520 --> 22:58.040]  I wouldn't recommend it, but it is a possibility.
[22:58.040 --> 23:00.520]  It's something you could do if you wanted to do.
[23:00.520 --> 23:04.720]  So I think you could veg infinitely if you can maintain the root ball and if you can
[23:04.720 --> 23:08.600]  keep the plant healthy and if you can keep the bugs and problems away.
[23:08.600 --> 23:12.200]  Like I said earlier, we're the ones that bring the problems most of the time.
[23:12.200 --> 23:16.440]  So in theory, you should be able to veg a cannabis plant infinitely if you have got
[23:16.440 --> 23:20.400]  the proper ceiling and light and light height.
[23:20.400 --> 23:23.480]  Eventually the plants will get so tall that if you were in an indoor environment, you
[23:23.480 --> 23:27.760]  won't be able to get any light penetration, but outdoors, the sun penetrates all the way
[23:27.760 --> 23:28.760]  through.
[23:28.760 --> 23:32.440]  You get a lot of light penetration from the sun, but unfortunately with the sun, we do
[23:32.520 --> 23:33.520]  run out of season.
[23:33.520 --> 23:38.080]  So the plants will go into flower once the sun tells them that it is time.
[23:38.080 --> 23:41.840]  So that is my long rant about veg times.
[23:41.840 --> 23:45.440]  Just make sure that when you veg your plants indoors for your tent, that you don't go too
[23:45.440 --> 23:48.120]  long because you don't want to grow up into the lights.
[23:48.120 --> 23:53.960]  Again, keep in mind that some cultivars will double in height by the time they are done
[23:53.960 --> 23:54.960]  flowering.
[23:54.960 --> 23:59.080]  So if you were doing a pheno hunt, I recommend flowering early for your first run just to
[23:59.080 --> 24:02.760]  find out if you've got a phenotype that gets ridiculously tall.
[24:02.760 --> 24:07.400]  I just did a pheno hunt and I found one plant that grew twice as tall as all of the other
[24:07.400 --> 24:09.040]  plants within the first 30 days.
[24:09.040 --> 24:11.040]  I had to move it to a different room.
[24:11.040 --> 24:12.680]  Most of the plants are up to my knee.
[24:12.680 --> 24:14.840]  This plant goes up to my mid chest.
[24:14.840 --> 24:17.040]  It is in the same environment, same condition.
[24:17.040 --> 24:18.720]  I don't know what went on with this thing.
[24:18.720 --> 24:22.480]  It may not even get to finish because it is going out of control.
[24:22.480 --> 24:26.120]  But for that first run, I recommend flowering a little bit early to find out what you've
[24:26.120 --> 24:30.400]  got, know what to expect, and then in your subsequent runs, you can adjust accordingly.
[24:30.400 --> 24:31.840]  You can set your veg time.
[24:31.840 --> 24:33.920]  You will be able to dial in your veg time perfectly.
[24:33.920 --> 24:36.680]  You'll know that when they're this tall, I need to flower because they're going to finish
[24:36.680 --> 24:37.840]  at this height.
[24:37.840 --> 24:41.760]  Once you develop a relationship with that specific cultivar, you'll know exactly how
[24:41.760 --> 24:42.760]  long to veg.
[24:42.760 --> 24:46.640]  All right, my Albuquerque friend, I want to thank you for your great email.
