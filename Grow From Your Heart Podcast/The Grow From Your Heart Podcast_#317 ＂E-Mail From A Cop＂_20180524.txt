[00:02.360 --> 00:05.360]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.360 --> 00:08.280]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:08.280 --> 00:11.680]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.520]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:14.680 --> 00:18.280]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist
[00:18.320 --> 00:21.240]  or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:21.560 --> 00:23.760]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:24.320 --> 00:26.320]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:26.320 --> 00:28.120]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:29.160 --> 00:31.560]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends
[00:31.560 --> 00:33.200]  at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:33.200 --> 00:36.080]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend
[00:36.080 --> 00:37.560]  the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:37.560 --> 00:40.560]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:40.920 --> 00:44.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong
[00:44.400 --> 00:47.520]  or start heating up that dab rig, because it's time for another episode
[00:47.520 --> 00:49.160]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:55.650 --> 00:56.770]  What's up, cannabis community?
[00:56.770 --> 00:59.690]  It's time for episode 317 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:59.690 --> 01:01.770]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:01.770 --> 01:04.450]  You guys, I just woke up from a tremendous nap.
[01:04.450 --> 01:08.610]  Our friends from Organica stopped by and we got a little bit lit up.
[01:08.610 --> 01:10.050]  I may have eaten too many edibles.
[01:10.050 --> 01:13.130]  I may have taken too many dabs, but I am back on my feet.
[01:13.290 --> 01:15.010]  I am ready to do a podcast.
[01:15.010 --> 01:18.010]  I like to start the episode off by letting you know what I am dabbing on.
[01:18.330 --> 01:20.610]  Today, I dabbed a little bit of everything.
[01:20.610 --> 01:23.050]  But what's going to happen is I'm going to tell you about this,
[01:23.050 --> 01:24.770]  that I'm going to press pause and take a dab,
[01:24.770 --> 01:26.170]  and then we're going to do a podcast.
[01:26.170 --> 01:29.890]  I am about to take a dab of some stuff called Clementine cookies
[01:30.090 --> 01:31.290]  from Viola Extracts.
[01:31.290 --> 01:33.930]  I picked this up at Doctor's Orders on Stem Beach.
[01:34.530 --> 01:37.850]  Doctor's Orders was having a sale on the Green Dot black label,
[01:37.850 --> 01:39.370]  and I stopped in for some of the Green Dot.
[01:39.370 --> 01:42.450]  I saw the Viola Labs products on sale.
[01:42.570 --> 01:45.850]  They had a jar on the counter and it was called Clementine cookies.
[01:46.010 --> 01:47.210]  I took a smell of it.
[01:47.210 --> 01:49.570]  And before I could set the jar down, my mouth said,
[01:49.730 --> 01:51.530]  I'll take a gram of this, please.
[01:51.530 --> 01:53.250]  This stuff smells amazing, you guys.
[01:53.250 --> 01:55.490]  I'm going to give it a sniff right now and try to describe it to you.
[01:56.810 --> 01:59.330]  So I can certainly smell the Girl Scout cookies.
[01:59.650 --> 02:01.930]  Girl Scout cookies has a spiciness to it.
[02:02.090 --> 02:05.250]  I think it's got a black pepper, kind of a spicy sort of a thing.
[02:05.250 --> 02:07.650]  That's a little bit of a sharp, astringent sort of a smell,
[02:07.770 --> 02:09.890]  which is honestly delicious. And I love it.
[02:09.890 --> 02:12.370]  That is dominant in the aroma of this concentrate.
[02:12.370 --> 02:14.330]  But right under that, there's a.
[02:15.450 --> 02:18.370]  This candy sweet bottom from the Clementine,
[02:19.090 --> 02:23.450]  it's like spicy, delicious oranges, and it smells amazing.
[02:23.970 --> 02:28.010]  The amount of turps to crystals was perfect in here.
[02:28.010 --> 02:31.730]  I think it was probably 70 percent crystals and 30 percent turps.
[02:32.530 --> 02:33.850]  I really like the texture of it.
[02:33.850 --> 02:36.730]  The flavor was super nice. The high was amazing.
[02:36.730 --> 02:40.730]  It came on super fast and it went right to my head, right to my eyes.
[02:40.730 --> 02:42.410]  It made my eyes feel all droopy.
[02:42.410 --> 02:44.410]  It made my head feel all fuzzy.
[02:44.410 --> 02:47.650]  I guess I would describe it more of a stoned than a high
[02:47.650 --> 02:48.890]  because I just wanted to chill out.
[02:48.890 --> 02:51.130]  I just wanted to stare into nothing for a couple of minutes.
[02:51.730 --> 02:53.330]  So this was kind of an impulse buy.
[02:53.330 --> 02:56.570]  And I am completely satisfied with the Clementine cookies,
[02:56.570 --> 03:00.210]  live resin from Viola extracts. Great work, you guys.
[03:00.370 --> 03:01.810]  Now, since I've hyped it up so much,
[03:01.810 --> 03:04.930]  I think I'm going to press pause and take a big fat dab.
[03:05.010 --> 03:07.650]  And then we're going to come back with an email from a cop.
[03:09.570 --> 03:11.130]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[03:11.130 --> 03:12.330]  I am heavily medicated.
[03:12.330 --> 03:16.690]  I just took a fat dab of the Clementine cookies, live resin from Viola extracts.
[03:16.930 --> 03:18.730]  It tastes better than I remembered.
[03:18.730 --> 03:20.890]  And the high went straight to my brain.
[03:21.250 --> 03:24.890]  One thing I did notice, I took the dab off of a rig with a smaller mouthpiece.
[03:25.290 --> 03:29.210]  I am learning that I prefer a larger, flared out mouthpiece.
[03:29.370 --> 03:30.450]  Too little of a mouthpiece.
[03:30.450 --> 03:32.650]  If you have to make that kissy face with your mouth,
[03:32.650 --> 03:35.530]  I feel like it makes your lips all sticky if you take a large dab.
[03:35.770 --> 03:38.770]  So larger mouthpieces for larger dabs.
[03:38.810 --> 03:40.370]  That's my opinion. That's my advice.
[03:40.370 --> 03:42.130]  I still want a small rig,
[03:42.130 --> 03:47.370]  but a flared out wider mouthpiece for less stickiness in my mustache and on my teeth.
[03:47.730 --> 03:50.490]  All right, you guys, I'm obviously heavily medicated.
[03:50.730 --> 03:54.410]  Before I took this dab break, I teased that we were going to read an email
[03:54.850 --> 03:57.210]  from a cop and you might say, how do you know it's from a cop?
[03:57.210 --> 04:01.730]  Well, I was checking my email a few days ago and I saw the subject line
[04:01.930 --> 04:05.970]  greetings from a cop, so I skipped everything else I was working on.
[04:05.970 --> 04:09.610]  And I scrolled right down and I opened up the email from my new cop friend.
[04:09.810 --> 04:11.290]  And it goes just like this.
[04:11.290 --> 04:14.770]  It says, hey, Ross DeGette, first off, thank you for the amazing podcast.
[04:15.210 --> 04:16.770]  Hey, dude, you're very welcome.
[04:16.770 --> 04:18.730]  Thank you for the amazing email.
[04:18.730 --> 04:19.330]  He keeps going.
[04:19.330 --> 04:21.530]  He says, I've just recently started listening to it,
[04:21.690 --> 04:25.810]  and I'm going back over old episodes about three to five hours daily.
[04:25.850 --> 04:27.090]  Wow, that's a lot of listening, man.
[04:27.090 --> 04:29.170]  Thank you. Thanks for the support.
[04:29.170 --> 04:32.330]  Also, if you've caught up on all of the episodes on iTunes and Stitcher,
[04:32.890 --> 04:35.410]  all of the episodes are available on YouTube.
[04:35.410 --> 04:38.370]  So if you want old, old content, you can go to the YouTube channel,
[04:38.370 --> 04:40.810]  go to YouTube, type in Grow From Your Heart Podcast,
[04:40.810 --> 04:44.410]  it'll bring up the YouTube channel and you can find all of the old episodes.
[04:44.410 --> 04:46.370]  That way you can listen to the really old stuff.
[04:46.370 --> 04:50.850]  Also, if you're all caught up on everything on Stitcher or iTunes.
[04:51.330 --> 04:53.130]  I'll keep going with the email. It goes like this.
[04:53.130 --> 04:56.810]  I wanted to tell you a little bit about myself and my current situation.
[04:57.090 --> 04:59.890]  First off, I will tell you that I am a police officer.
[05:00.130 --> 05:03.690]  Prior to becoming a cop, I used to regularly, like every day,
[05:03.690 --> 05:06.690]  smoke cannabis from about 16 to 22 years old.
[05:07.090 --> 05:09.210]  At age 22, I decided to stop.
[05:09.650 --> 05:13.490]  A series of positive events led to my becoming an officer.
[05:13.690 --> 05:15.850]  I told myself I would never be a hypocrite.
[05:16.170 --> 05:20.290]  I would never arrest or ticket someone for something that I would do,
[05:20.330 --> 05:24.010]  like smoking weed, rolling stop signs, driving too fast, et cetera.
[05:24.210 --> 05:27.250]  But I would be happy to arrest people for beating their wife,
[05:27.490 --> 05:30.570]  breaking into houses, shooting others, abusing children.
[05:30.810 --> 05:32.250]  You see where I'm heading.
[05:32.250 --> 05:37.010]  I can honestly say I sleep just fine knowing I don't break my personal code.
[05:37.570 --> 05:41.050]  I kind of feel if more police officers had this approach to their job,
[05:41.170 --> 05:44.410]  that more people would respect the police and the community
[05:44.410 --> 05:46.730]  would get along with the police a little bit better.
[05:47.610 --> 05:51.850]  I don't feel that law enforcement understands the long-term effects
[05:51.850 --> 05:54.730]  of their harassment and some of the things that they do to the community.
[05:55.210 --> 05:59.090]  Sometimes a person will have an interaction with law enforcement
[05:59.090 --> 06:02.650]  and they will receive a ticket for something that they don't agree with.
[06:03.130 --> 06:05.850]  And then they've got to go to court, which means they've got to miss a day of work.
[06:06.170 --> 06:09.970]  Or they've got to pay a fine, which means now they're even more behind
[06:09.970 --> 06:12.050]  because not all of us are doing okay financially.
[06:12.970 --> 06:14.810]  So those people fall behind financially.
[06:15.010 --> 06:15.770]  They get a fine.
[06:16.410 --> 06:19.610]  If you've got the option of paying your car payment or paying your rent
[06:19.610 --> 06:22.130]  or paying that fine, you're going to pay the rent and the car payment
[06:22.130 --> 06:23.930]  because you don't see what happens if you don't pay the fine.
[06:23.930 --> 06:24.970]  Now you've got a bench warrant.
[06:24.970 --> 06:26.010]  Now you go to jail.
[06:26.010 --> 06:27.690]  While you're in jail, you lose your car.
[06:27.690 --> 06:29.210]  While you're in jail, you lose your job.
[06:29.210 --> 06:31.090]  While you lose your job, you lose your house.
[06:31.090 --> 06:32.730]  And it begins a spiral of shit.
[06:32.730 --> 06:36.490]  And I don't know if law enforcement realizes what they do to people sometimes
[06:37.290 --> 06:41.130]  when things could simply be excused or overlooked.
[06:41.130 --> 06:43.170]  If nobody's hurting anybody, I don't see a reason.
[06:43.370 --> 06:44.170]  There's no crime.
[06:44.170 --> 06:47.170]  If nobody's getting hurt, if nobody's causing a problem, there's no reason
[06:47.170 --> 06:48.290]  to fuck up somebody's life.
[06:48.650 --> 06:53.410]  And so I respect an officer that can use situational awareness and judgment
[06:53.570 --> 06:55.050]  and not cause a problem for somebody.
[06:55.050 --> 06:56.890]  So man, a lot of respect to you for that.
[06:57.010 --> 06:57.490]  Thank you.
[06:57.490 --> 06:58.690]  I appreciate you for that.
[06:58.930 --> 06:59.930]  Not all cops are bad.
[06:59.930 --> 07:00.970]  We got to keep that in mind.
[07:01.130 --> 07:03.370]  I want to keep reading the email because I'm super rambly
[07:03.370 --> 07:04.850]  after the dabs I just took.
[07:05.850 --> 07:09.850]  The email goes on to say about two years ago, I had a terrible injury at work
[07:09.970 --> 07:13.570]  fighting a man that I was arresting after investigating how he had molested
[07:13.570 --> 07:17.690]  a three-year-old boy, and I have had three major surgeries and
[07:17.690 --> 07:20.170]  five giant needle injections.
[07:20.690 --> 07:21.810]  Man, that's a huge sentence.
[07:21.810 --> 07:24.130]  There's a lot of stuff to absorb in that one.
[07:24.130 --> 07:27.650]  So you had a terrible injury at work fighting a man that you arrested
[07:28.770 --> 07:31.090]  because he had molested a three-year-old boy.
[07:31.090 --> 07:32.770]  So that's a lot of mental stuff to deal with.
[07:34.130 --> 07:36.850]  First of all, you know that this man was doing some terribleness
[07:37.330 --> 07:38.330]  and you had to arrest him.
[07:38.330 --> 07:41.610]  And then when that went down, he tried to physically fight you where you got
[07:41.610 --> 07:43.450]  injured and it changed your life.
[07:43.970 --> 07:47.450]  And since then you've had three surgeries, probably all three of those are traumatic
[07:47.810 --> 07:54.250]  and five giant needle injections, saying the phrase five giant needle injections
[07:54.250 --> 07:56.130]  makes my toes curl every time I say it.
[07:56.130 --> 07:58.050]  So it sounds like you've been through a lot, man.
[07:58.290 --> 08:00.210]  It sounds like you're going through a lot and it sounds like
[08:00.210 --> 08:01.570]  you were trying to be a good cop.
[08:01.570 --> 08:05.930]  So that's terrible that this is sort of the hand you were dealt for being a good cop.
[08:06.130 --> 08:07.290]  I want to keep reading your message.
[08:07.290 --> 08:11.970]  It says, obviously I was given opiate pain pills like they were candy and they led me
[08:12.010 --> 08:13.930]  into a deep, dark place.
[08:14.210 --> 08:16.570]  I've heard this story a lot and I kind of know how that goes.
[08:16.810 --> 08:18.570]  It seems like a lot of people get injured.
[08:19.170 --> 08:20.610]  A lot of good folks get injured.
[08:20.890 --> 08:21.690]  They go to the doctor.
[08:21.690 --> 08:25.170]  They end up getting put on these pills and it turns their life around.
[08:25.170 --> 08:26.170]  It's not the injury.
[08:26.450 --> 08:27.730]  It's not the depression.
[08:27.730 --> 08:28.970]  It's not the change of life.
[08:29.010 --> 08:33.930]  It's the pills that these doctors are giving people that seems to send them down a dark path.
[08:34.330 --> 08:36.330]  He continues to say, really not fun.
[08:36.330 --> 08:39.250]  And I'm glad to be alive on this side of pain pills.
[08:39.570 --> 08:46.210]  After nearly a year and a half of either 24 seven pain or opiate induced stupor, I got a CBD vape.
[08:46.250 --> 08:47.730]  This is where the story starts to change.
[08:47.730 --> 08:53.010]  You guys, I used that for about a week and decided, F it, give me the real thing.
[08:53.330 --> 08:54.490]  So this guy was in pain.
[08:54.890 --> 08:57.450]  He was in an opiate induced stupor.
[08:57.650 --> 08:58.970]  This guy wasn't himself anymore.
[08:58.970 --> 09:00.650]  He probably wasn't enjoying life.
[09:00.730 --> 09:02.650]  His family probably wasn't enjoying him.
[09:03.010 --> 09:04.090]  He wasn't happy anymore.
[09:04.090 --> 09:08.730]  He was just a zombie because of these doctors just pumping them up with pain pills.
[09:09.010 --> 09:12.930]  So he got himself a CBD vape and it sounds like it was working for a little bit.
[09:13.090 --> 09:15.770]  And then he decided, F it, give me the real thing.
[09:15.770 --> 09:19.770]  And that's where he goes on to say, cannabis has literally saved me from pills.
[09:20.010 --> 09:27.210]  Cannabis has about the same pain relieving qualities as pills, but cannabis does not leave me depressed after.
[09:27.490 --> 09:31.210]  I can say the biggest side effect I see is the munchies.
[09:31.370 --> 09:35.770]  See, the biggest side effect, which isn't even, I don't believe in side effect.
[09:35.770 --> 09:39.650]  I think that is an effect because you can't separate the effects of something.
[09:39.650 --> 09:41.010]  If you just said, what does it do to you?
[09:41.450 --> 09:42.570]  He says, it makes me stoned.
[09:42.570 --> 09:43.890]  It makes me forget things.
[09:43.890 --> 09:45.090]  It makes me kind of chill out.
[09:45.410 --> 09:46.490]  It also makes me hungry.
[09:46.490 --> 09:49.130]  That's an effect, not a side effect in my opinion, sorry, random rant.
[09:49.530 --> 09:53.810]  But the worst effect he got from it was the munchies.
[09:53.850 --> 10:03.490]  And for somebody who has been laid up for a little while and who has been in pain and who has been on narcotic pills that are making them a zombie, the munchies probably isn't a bad thing.
[10:03.490 --> 10:05.090]  You're probably a little emaciated.
[10:05.410 --> 10:07.650]  You'd probably use a couple of snacks, honestly.
[10:08.290 --> 10:12.810]  But also he says that the cannabis does not leave him depressed like the pain pills did.
[10:12.970 --> 10:14.730]  And also they're not doing liver damage.
[10:14.730 --> 10:17.850]  They're not doing kidney damage and they're not making you a zombie.
[10:18.090 --> 10:19.250]  They're leaving you functional.
[10:19.650 --> 10:20.650]  You've got the munchies.
[10:20.890 --> 10:21.890]  That's not too bad.
[10:22.450 --> 10:32.650]  As long as you're not handling those munchies with cartons of Ben and Jerry's ice cream and Snickers bars, as long as you're treating that properly, maybe you got some, some avocado slices or some hard boiled eggs.
[10:32.650 --> 10:34.290]  Maybe you got you some ants on a log.
[10:34.290 --> 10:36.570]  Maybe you got some celery and peanut butter with raisins on it.
[10:36.570 --> 10:37.410]  Like a big kid.
[10:37.570 --> 10:37.890]  I don't know.
[10:37.890 --> 10:46.810]  Hopefully you're doing something good to take care of those munchies, but that's, if that's the worst effect that's coming from it and you're not getting depressed, you're not getting your liver torn up.
[10:46.810 --> 10:51.170]  You're not getting your stomach burnt up and you're not acting like a zombie and you're functional.
[10:51.690 --> 10:52.970]  Eat whatever you want to eat.
[10:53.490 --> 10:54.610]  Maybe you get you a little gut.
[10:54.610 --> 10:55.490]  You're going to be all right.
[10:56.090 --> 10:59.370]  He keeps on going and says, I recently started growing my own cannabis.
[10:59.410 --> 11:03.930]  I can't really do much physical activities due to my injury, but I am able to garden.
[11:04.730 --> 11:09.290]  I really think that growing your own cannabis is going to help you in so many ways.
[11:09.290 --> 11:14.410]  It'll be very therapeutic because now you've got something you can do that you're physically able to do that.
[11:14.410 --> 11:17.330]  You can take pride in, you can put some time into that garden.
[11:17.330 --> 11:21.890]  You can look at it and you can sit back when you're done working and you can go, those plants look good, man.
[11:21.890 --> 11:22.690]  Cause I did that.
[11:22.690 --> 11:25.970]  I just put in a few hours doing that and those plants look really good.
[11:25.970 --> 11:30.730]  And then when it's time to cut them down, dry them, cure them and smoke them, you get to feel that pride of, I did this.
[11:30.730 --> 11:32.250]  I didn't have to pay anybody for this.
[11:32.690 --> 11:35.210]  And then also there's this thing of, I know what's in here.
[11:35.490 --> 11:37.530]  I didn't spray this with any weird shit.
[11:37.730 --> 11:39.290]  I didn't do anything stupid to this.
[11:39.490 --> 11:41.810]  I know what's in this cannabis and it's such a good feeling.
[11:44.250 --> 11:46.090]  So let me continue with the email.
[11:46.090 --> 11:50.610]  He says, I am able to garden and I have an organic outdoor setup.
[11:50.650 --> 11:51.770]  That is awesome to hear, man.
[11:52.010 --> 11:54.050]  I hope you got to listen to the episodes with Sean.
[11:54.050 --> 11:55.730]  I hope you listened to the episodes with Jesse.
[11:55.970 --> 11:57.970]  If you have questions about that, send me an email.
[11:58.290 --> 12:00.450]  He says, I'm growing in smart pots so far.
[12:00.450 --> 12:02.090]  Things are small, but happy.
[12:02.450 --> 12:04.730]  Man, that's the best way to keep it for a personal garden.
[12:04.730 --> 12:07.330]  Don't go, uh, don't get yourself in over your head.
[12:07.690 --> 12:13.450]  He says, ingesting, growing, listening and learning about cannabis has saved my life.
[12:13.490 --> 12:16.410]  I'm going to read that sentence again, you guys, because this is tremendous.
[12:16.450 --> 12:22.730]  He says, ingesting, growing, listening and learning about cannabis has saved my life.
[12:23.130 --> 12:24.570]  Cannabis has saved another life.
[12:24.570 --> 12:28.130]  You guys learning about cannabis has saved this person's life.
[12:28.130 --> 12:29.250]  So shout out to cannabis.
[12:29.530 --> 12:30.930]  Thank you to cannabis.
[12:31.890 --> 12:36.250]  He says there were days when I thought about suicide or nearly killed myself by
[12:36.250 --> 12:40.330]  taking more than the prescription and then mixing alcohol, I haven't taken a
[12:40.330 --> 12:44.930]  pill in months, haven't had a drink and mentally and emotionally, I feel much.
[12:45.210 --> 12:45.850]  Better.
[12:46.170 --> 12:51.610]  You guys, this guy is not drinking or taking pills and he is consuming cannabis
[12:51.810 --> 12:58.490]  and his mental and physical state have drastically improved cannabis.
[12:58.490 --> 13:00.610]  You guys, I don't need to preach to the choir, right?
[13:00.610 --> 13:03.290]  Most of the people listening are already going, yeah, Rasta Jeff, we're on your
[13:03.290 --> 13:07.170]  team, you guys, I love hearing messages like this, no matter how many times I hear
[13:07.170 --> 13:08.610]  this, it puts a smile on my face.
[13:08.610 --> 13:09.610]  It puts some pride in me.
[13:09.810 --> 13:13.570]  It makes me feel good about being a spokesperson or an ambassador for this
[13:13.570 --> 13:13.850]  plant.
[13:13.850 --> 13:15.370]  It really, uh, it puts pride in me.
[13:15.370 --> 13:18.250]  Again, it re sparks the, uh, the passion that I've got.
[13:18.250 --> 13:21.210]  Like granny said, the passion has never gone away and it's because things like
[13:21.210 --> 13:24.090]  this spark it every single time I get a message.
[13:24.370 --> 13:25.770]  So this part is where it gets great.
[13:25.770 --> 13:29.530]  He says, Rasta Jeff, thank you for being a part of my life and giving me this
[13:29.530 --> 13:30.970]  enriching podcast.
[13:31.250 --> 13:33.450]  Hey man, thank you for this great email.
[13:33.690 --> 13:34.850]  You are very welcome.
[13:35.090 --> 13:38.810]  Um, I am glad you didn't do anything ridiculous when you were in those dark
[13:38.810 --> 13:42.490]  depressed days, to be quite honest, excuse me for all the throat problems.
[13:42.490 --> 13:44.730]  You guys, we're going to blame that on the Viola extracts here.
[13:45.170 --> 13:49.370]  Uh, to be quite honest, I had a traumatic brain injury a couple, maybe three years
[13:49.370 --> 13:52.730]  ago, and there were times I couldn't figure out how to tie my shoes.
[13:52.970 --> 13:55.810]  There were times I would be brushing my teeth and couldn't figure out why I was
[13:55.810 --> 13:57.490]  standing in the kitchen with her in the bathroom.
[13:57.490 --> 13:58.570]  So yeah, I'm still doing weird shit.
[13:58.810 --> 14:01.130]  While I was standing in the bathroom with a mouthful of weird shit.
[14:01.410 --> 14:04.610]  There were times when the thought of ending everything would pass through my
[14:04.610 --> 14:07.770]  mind, but I knew that it was just because my brain was broken and it wasn't working.
[14:07.770 --> 14:08.050]  Right.
[14:08.370 --> 14:11.410]  So I'm proud of you and I'm happy that you made it through that.
[14:11.610 --> 14:14.930]  Thank you for sticking through it and battling through that with us and
[14:14.930 --> 14:16.730]  being on team cannabis with us.
[14:16.730 --> 14:20.330]  Now you, you wouldn't have been able to be a good spokesperson for cannabis.
[14:20.530 --> 14:22.530]  So thank you for making it through that.
[14:22.530 --> 14:26.370]  Thank you for, uh, enduring and thank you for being part of team cannabis.
[14:26.370 --> 14:29.610]  Thank you for having an open mind and realizing that cannabis could
[14:29.610 --> 14:31.250]  be part of what would help you.
[14:31.770 --> 14:33.890]  So you're very welcome is what I'm trying to say.
[14:33.890 --> 14:36.010]  And thank you for the great email.
[14:36.010 --> 14:37.610]  He goes on to say PPS.
[14:38.090 --> 14:42.770]  I would be happy to answer any questions about law enforcement in a legal state.
[14:42.930 --> 14:48.810]  And my experience as a patrolman trainer, detective and SWAT operator, happy
[14:48.810 --> 14:53.010]  growing from my heart signed blue, green, green, blue, green, green.
[14:53.570 --> 14:55.530]  Thank you for the wonderful email.
[14:55.810 --> 15:00.250]  Messages like this are part of why I do this podcast, knowing that I'm helping
[15:00.250 --> 15:03.690]  people change their lives, possibly helping you save your life.
[15:03.930 --> 15:06.970]  This makes all of the time, the energy, the effort, the frustration,
[15:06.970 --> 15:11.730]  sometimes the struggle, uh, it's all worth it because of messages like this.
[15:11.730 --> 15:13.210]  I really appreciate that.
[15:13.690 --> 15:17.810]  So you said that you would be happy to answer any questions about law enforcement.
[15:18.050 --> 15:20.210]  I don't have a question about law enforcement.
[15:20.210 --> 15:24.930]  My question is now that you have personally experienced the healing
[15:24.930 --> 15:27.050]  qualities and properties of cannabis.
[15:27.330 --> 15:31.930]  Are you going to, or have you been educating your fellow law enforcement?
[15:32.330 --> 15:35.050]  Have you been advocating in any way saying, Hey guys, we
[15:35.050 --> 15:36.650]  may be looking at this all wrong.
[15:36.890 --> 15:38.250]  Have you done anything like that?
[15:38.610 --> 15:40.170]  Um, it's not your duty.
[15:40.370 --> 15:41.330]  You've done your duty.
[15:41.330 --> 15:43.410]  Trust me, but it would be cool.
[15:43.410 --> 15:46.370]  If you could say some things like that to some of your cop friends,
[15:46.650 --> 15:48.250]  maybe don't even approach them.
[15:48.450 --> 15:49.410]  Maybe just bring it up.
[15:49.850 --> 15:52.170]  You know, when you're at lunch with them or when you're on the phone with them,
[15:52.490 --> 15:52.850]  I don't know.
[15:53.330 --> 15:56.730]  I'm curious if you're open about it with your law enforcement friends.
[15:57.050 --> 15:59.970]  I'm curious what you're going to do in the future about that.
[16:00.170 --> 16:04.170]  And are you going to use your personal experience as an
[16:04.170 --> 16:07.050]  opportunity to advocate for cannabis?
[16:07.810 --> 16:08.570]  Just curious.
[16:08.890 --> 16:12.090]  Uh, send me another email and we'll talk about it on a future episode.
[16:12.290 --> 16:14.130]  Hey, again, man, blue and green.
[16:14.290 --> 16:14.690]  Really?
[16:14.770 --> 16:16.090]  I appreciate your service.
[16:16.410 --> 16:20.610]  Uh, I appreciate your attitude and I definitely appreciate the great email.
[16:20.930 --> 16:22.290]  I hope things go well for you.
[16:22.370 --> 16:24.210]  If you need anything, send me an email.
[16:24.690 --> 16:25.770]  I'd be happy to help you out.
[16:26.250 --> 16:26.570]  All right.
[16:26.570 --> 16:27.290]  Podcast world.
[16:27.290 --> 16:31.410]  I received a message on Instagram and somebody was asking me, what is the
[16:31.410 --> 16:35.730]  difference in the way that medical and recreational cannabis are grown here in
[16:35.730 --> 16:36.290]  Colorado?
[16:36.290 --> 16:38.250]  They said, what's the difference if any?
[16:38.450 --> 16:39.770]  And my answer was pretty simple.
[16:39.770 --> 16:41.450]  I said, there's no difference.
[16:41.450 --> 16:45.810]  You guys, a lot of people think that medical marijuana is grown in some
[16:45.810 --> 16:50.570]  fancy laboratory and it's done in some magical mythical way, but honestly,
[16:51.250 --> 16:56.370]  medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in Colorado are grown in
[16:56.370 --> 16:57.890]  very similar facilities.
[16:58.210 --> 16:59.810]  I can speak from experience.
[16:59.970 --> 17:02.090]  I am the lead cultivator for three rivers.
[17:02.210 --> 17:07.130]  I run their medical marijuana facility and I run their recreational marijuana
[17:07.130 --> 17:07.690]  facility.
[17:07.930 --> 17:11.210]  They are two different buildings, but they are simply across the
[17:11.210 --> 17:12.490]  parking lot from each other.
[17:12.690 --> 17:12.930]  Okay.
[17:12.930 --> 17:15.050]  It's building right here, building right here.
[17:15.410 --> 17:18.530]  I run from one building to the other all day, taking care of two different
[17:18.530 --> 17:19.010]  grows.
[17:19.330 --> 17:25.210]  Now they are the same strains of plants, but they are not the same plants.
[17:25.530 --> 17:28.970]  The plants in the medical grow cannot enter the recreational grow.
[17:29.170 --> 17:32.610]  The plants at the recreational grow cannot enter the medical grow.
[17:32.650 --> 17:34.450]  They are to be kept separate at all times.
[17:34.650 --> 17:38.010]  It is two different business licenses with two different names, two different
[17:38.010 --> 17:40.490]  entities, just owned by the same people.
[17:40.490 --> 17:42.410]  So I bounce back and forth and run both of them.
[17:42.410 --> 17:47.490]  Now, now as for the facilities, the buildings are constructed and designed
[17:47.690 --> 17:48.810]  fairly similarly.
[17:49.330 --> 17:53.410]  We're using long tables from Midwest.
[17:53.410 --> 17:56.250]  Is it Midwest hydro or Midwest greenhouse supply?
[17:56.530 --> 17:59.090]  Some company like that makes long rolling tables.
[17:59.090 --> 18:01.090]  We've got those tables in both facilities.
[18:01.330 --> 18:04.090]  We've got double ended Govita lights in both facilities.
[18:04.090 --> 18:06.290]  We've got giant HVAC in both facilities.
[18:06.290 --> 18:08.770]  We've got the auto water system in both facilities.
[18:09.290 --> 18:12.690]  Both facilities are fed the exact same mix.
[18:12.690 --> 18:16.410]  We don't buy this brand of nutrients for this facility and this brand of
[18:16.410 --> 18:17.650]  nutrients for this facility.
[18:17.650 --> 18:22.090]  We buy a whole shit ton and put it in the warehouse and then divide it up amongst
[18:22.090 --> 18:23.210]  each grow as needed.
[18:23.530 --> 18:26.850]  So it's the same tables, the same lights.
[18:26.890 --> 18:28.090]  It's the same nutrients.
[18:28.090 --> 18:29.570]  It's the same master grower.
[18:29.770 --> 18:31.010]  It's the same grow techs.
[18:31.010 --> 18:32.250]  It's the same trimmers.
[18:33.210 --> 18:34.970]  It is the same trellis technique.
[18:35.490 --> 18:37.730]  It is mostly the same genetics.
[18:38.130 --> 18:42.010]  So when a grow is started in Colorado, depending on how it started, the plants
[18:42.010 --> 18:43.530]  have to come from somewhere, right?
[18:43.970 --> 18:50.970]  If the license, if the recreational license is spawned from an existing medical
[18:50.970 --> 18:56.050]  marijuana license, there is an opportunity for a one-time plant transfer.
[18:56.450 --> 19:02.010]  So that means if I own a medical marijuana facility and I would like to convert my
[19:02.010 --> 19:06.130]  medical marijuana to have a recreational marijuana side of my store, which means
[19:06.130 --> 19:10.490]  everybody can shop there, not just Colorado medical patients, I would be allowed to
[19:10.490 --> 19:16.170]  do a one-time transfer to my grow, which means I would be allowed to take a clone
[19:16.410 --> 19:19.650]  of everything or 50 clones of everything in the grow.
[19:19.890 --> 19:21.490]  So I could go down my genetic list.
[19:21.490 --> 19:22.410]  I could get a rise.
[19:22.410 --> 19:24.010]  I could get blueberry headband.
[19:24.010 --> 19:26.730]  I could get platinum tangy, go get a clone of everything.
[19:26.770 --> 19:30.450]  They have to go in the computer properly and they have to be manifested and
[19:30.450 --> 19:35.170]  transferred through the computer system and then legally transferred from one grow
[19:35.170 --> 19:35.770]  to the other.
[19:36.010 --> 19:39.610]  Once they're at the other grow, they have to be received in a computer system and
[19:39.610 --> 19:41.370]  unloaded and tagged properly.
[19:41.690 --> 19:45.130]  So you're allowed to do that one time when a new facility opens.
[19:45.490 --> 19:48.010]  So it's the same genetics.
[19:48.570 --> 19:53.410]  We're taking the genetics from the medical marijuana facility and manifesting them
[19:53.410 --> 19:55.490]  over to the recreational facility.
[19:55.490 --> 19:56.530]  It's the same plants.
[19:56.530 --> 19:59.170]  Now we're growing, we'll just say platinum tangy.
[19:59.450 --> 20:02.090]  We'll say sour tangy because we don't have platinum tangy at the rec grow.
[20:02.650 --> 20:03.610]  We'll say sour tangy.
[20:03.610 --> 20:05.930]  We've got sour tangy at the medical marijuana grow.
[20:06.530 --> 20:11.690]  Hypothetically, if we were to open another recreational grow that spawned off of our
[20:11.690 --> 20:15.570]  medical license, we could just cut clones of that sour tangy, put them in the
[20:15.570 --> 20:20.330]  computer, make a manifest for transfer, transfer them, receive that transfer.
[20:20.570 --> 20:25.970]  And now we've legally got that sour tangy clone in the garden at our new recreational
[20:25.970 --> 20:26.490]  facility.
[20:26.930 --> 20:30.050]  Now that's not exactly what happened with Three Rivers or anything, but I mean,
[20:30.050 --> 20:31.850]  that's hypothetically how it works.
[20:31.850 --> 20:34.690]  That's how the clones are spread from one facility to another.
[20:34.890 --> 20:36.250]  There are other options to do it.
[20:36.530 --> 20:41.130]  Um, we can sell clones if Three Rivers, either the medical or the recreational grow
[20:41.130 --> 20:45.090]  wanted to sell a clone, we could set up a business deal with another facility.
[20:45.250 --> 20:47.050]  We could sell them trays of clones.
[20:47.050 --> 20:50.530]  They could take 50 to 500 clones of whatever they wanted of our genetics.
[20:50.530 --> 20:51.890]  We could pass it right along to them.
[20:52.170 --> 20:55.290]  If that was something we do, we don't really sell clones, but that's where the
[20:55.290 --> 20:56.250]  genetics come from.
[20:56.530 --> 21:00.450]  You guys, the medical marijuana clones and the recreational marijuana clones are the
[21:00.450 --> 21:01.290]  same plants.
[21:01.370 --> 21:02.970]  They just have different colored tags.
[21:03.290 --> 21:07.330]  The medical marijuana facilities and the recreational marijuana facilities are
[21:07.330 --> 21:08.650]  basically the same things.
[21:08.690 --> 21:12.730]  They just have different colored plant tags and they're taxed differently and sold in
[21:12.730 --> 21:13.530]  different stores.
[21:13.810 --> 21:15.610]  We're using the same exact nutrients.
[21:15.850 --> 21:17.810]  I'm putting the same exact amount of care.
[21:18.010 --> 21:21.330]  The same pesticides are allowed on both products.
[21:21.610 --> 21:25.170]  The marijuana enforcement division, the Colorado department of public health and
[21:25.170 --> 21:28.970]  environment, and the Colorado department of agriculture have all agreed on a certain
[21:28.970 --> 21:29.850]  set of pesticides.
[21:29.850 --> 21:31.410]  We are and are not allowed to use.
[21:31.690 --> 21:33.850]  Those are the same for both facilities.
[21:33.850 --> 21:37.490]  So I don't have to make pesticide plans of attack for different facilities.
[21:37.490 --> 21:40.370]  I could just use my same idea over here as I use over there.
[21:40.610 --> 21:44.490]  So I guess the short answer to that question of what's the difference between the way
[21:44.490 --> 21:47.610]  medical and recreational marijuana are grown in Colorado.
[21:48.090 --> 21:49.810]  The main difference is taxes.
[21:49.850 --> 21:50.970]  That's the only difference.
[21:50.970 --> 21:52.210]  They are taxed differently.
[21:52.210 --> 21:56.170]  Recreational marijuana is taxed much higher than medical marijuana.
[21:56.650 --> 21:59.050]  Other than the taxes, it's the same plants.
[21:59.130 --> 22:01.210]  It's the same nutrients, the same lights, the
[22:01.210 --> 22:03.290]  same tables, the same pesticides.
[22:03.290 --> 22:04.410]  It's all the same stuff.
[22:04.890 --> 22:09.250]  I don't do anything differently in the medical grow than I do in the recreational
[22:09.250 --> 22:12.330]  grow. I don't go over to one grow and say, Ooh, this is going to this store.
[22:12.330 --> 22:13.490]  Let's do it differently.
[22:13.730 --> 22:15.090]  I treat all of them the same.
[22:15.130 --> 22:16.850]  I love each plant the same.
[22:16.890 --> 22:18.530]  I make them all the best I can.
[22:18.970 --> 22:20.050]  I trellis them down.
[22:20.210 --> 22:21.370]  I pop and crack the sticks.
[22:21.370 --> 22:22.370]  I defoliate them.
[22:22.650 --> 22:23.930]  I treat them all the same.
[22:24.450 --> 22:27.050]  So the only difference really is the taxes.
[22:27.490 --> 22:32.930]  Now, with that being said, every store is going to have a different level of
[22:32.930 --> 22:36.210]  quality. Every grow is going to have a different standard.
[22:36.490 --> 22:41.890]  Every trim company, every trim crew is going to have a different standard and a
[22:41.890 --> 22:43.890]  level of quality of trimming.
[22:44.170 --> 22:45.170]  So keep that in mind.
[22:45.170 --> 22:50.650]  If you go to one store and they've got hairy buds that are untrimmed and super
[22:50.650 --> 22:55.810]  dry, check another store because they may have perfectly dried and cured buds that
[22:55.810 --> 22:56.930]  are beautifully trimmed.
[22:57.170 --> 23:00.930]  Don't judge all of Colorado by one or two dispensaries.
[23:01.050 --> 23:03.130]  Please shop around when you come here.
[23:03.810 --> 23:07.010]  But if you're coming from out of state, please don't feel like you're getting
[23:07.010 --> 23:10.130]  slighted. Please don't feel like you're getting skipped on the quality products
[23:10.250 --> 23:12.690]  just because you're not buying a medical marijuana product.
[23:12.810 --> 23:17.370]  You're getting the same exact quality as you would get if you were a Colorado
[23:17.370 --> 23:18.890]  medical marijuana patient.
[23:19.690 --> 23:24.690]  The next thing I want to talk about was inspired by my friend Mama Bear Dabs on
[23:24.690 --> 23:29.570]  Instagram. A young lady asked Mama Bear Dabs how to get into the cannabis
[23:29.570 --> 23:31.770]  industry. And Lucy had great answers.
[23:31.810 --> 23:35.810]  She said, first of all, find out if you can get a badge, get yourself a badge,
[23:35.930 --> 23:40.210]  then come to Colorado and apply for jobs just like you would any other business.
[23:40.570 --> 23:42.490]  She also said to have a good resume.
[23:42.850 --> 23:47.130]  I thought it would be a good idea to mention some of the things that you may
[23:47.130 --> 23:51.370]  include on your resume to get yourself into the cannabis industry.
[23:51.530 --> 23:53.250]  Or if you're in the cannabis industry,
[23:53.410 --> 23:58.090]  there are things you can do to improve your resume to hopefully improve your pay
[23:58.250 --> 24:01.770]  and your status in the cannabis industry. So let's get right to it.
[24:02.530 --> 24:05.850]  Here are some things you can think about if you're making a resume,
[24:05.930 --> 24:07.970]  trying to get a job in the cannabis industry.
[24:07.970 --> 24:11.650]  Now the first thing you should think about is you're trying to get a job just
[24:11.650 --> 24:14.970]  like you're trying to get other any other job. You need to be professional,
[24:15.210 --> 24:19.370]  make a professional looking resume, run spell check a couple of times.
[24:20.170 --> 24:22.010]  Now, if you're not good at making a resume,
[24:22.050 --> 24:26.010]  there are plenty of websites that will have templates for you to go and kind of
[24:26.010 --> 24:30.290]  get a good guideline on how to make a resume. Follow that template,
[24:30.290 --> 24:34.050]  follow that guideline and make a standard resume. Put in your information,
[24:34.050 --> 24:36.170]  put in your skills, put in your education.
[24:36.490 --> 24:41.170]  Now this is where we are going to dial it in and make it a little bit cannabis
[24:41.410 --> 24:43.010]  industry specific.
[24:43.810 --> 24:48.770]  List any of your skills that you think may help
[24:48.810 --> 24:52.010]  you with the job you're trying to get. If you're trying to be a bud tender,
[24:52.090 --> 24:55.650]  put any customer service skills that you've had put in that you know how to use
[24:55.650 --> 24:58.370]  the metric system, put in that you're familiar with weights.
[24:58.650 --> 25:02.170]  If you're trying to be a grower, put in that you have grown before,
[25:02.610 --> 25:06.370]  put down the types of ways you have grown. Have you grown hydroponic?
[25:06.370 --> 25:08.770]  Have you grown deep water culture? Have you grown soilless?
[25:08.770 --> 25:09.690]  Have you grown soil?
[25:10.090 --> 25:13.650]  Put in all of the stuff that you have done so that we know who we are dealing
[25:13.650 --> 25:16.370]  with. If you're trying to be a trimmer,
[25:16.690 --> 25:20.650]  tell me how long you've been trimming. Tell me your experience.
[25:21.130 --> 25:24.330]  Tell me what equipment you have used. If you're trying to be a trimmer,
[25:24.330 --> 25:27.170]  have you used the trim reaper? Have you used the tornado? Have you used the
[25:27.170 --> 25:30.650]  twister? What have you used as a trimmer? Are you just a scissor guy?
[25:30.850 --> 25:32.450]  Do you trim fast with your fingers?
[25:32.850 --> 25:37.770]  Also mark down any trainings or certifications you've got.
[25:38.650 --> 25:40.970]  I would always recommend getting a key badge.
[25:41.010 --> 25:44.890]  If you're going for a badge and you can afford it, get a key badge.
[25:44.890 --> 25:47.090]  There's no reason not to get the key badge.
[25:47.090 --> 25:50.450]  A support badge is great that gets you in the door, but that's all that does.
[25:50.810 --> 25:53.450]  I need a key badge on premises at all times.
[25:53.810 --> 25:57.010]  If I am in the commercial grow and I want to go to the recreational grow,
[25:57.210 --> 26:00.410]  I've got to make sure there's a key badge there keeping an eye on everybody
[26:00.410 --> 26:04.650]  because I can't leave a bunch of support badges in the room without a key badge
[26:04.690 --> 26:06.450]  on site. It is simply illegal.
[26:07.490 --> 26:10.890]  If you have worker protection safety training, document that.
[26:10.890 --> 26:13.250]  If you haven't had worker protection safety training,
[26:13.570 --> 26:17.130]  I would learn how to get worker protection safety training in the state of
[26:17.130 --> 26:20.730]  Colorado so that you can put that on your resume.
[26:21.050 --> 26:23.330]  Also, if you are a pesticide applicator,
[26:23.330 --> 26:27.530]  or you've had department of agriculture pesticide training, list that.
[26:27.930 --> 26:31.770]  If you have respirator training or respirator certifications,
[26:31.770 --> 26:34.970]  maybe you were a fireman in the past, maybe you worked with paints or something.
[26:35.370 --> 26:39.450]  If you know how to use, wear, clean, and safely remove a respirator,
[26:39.690 --> 26:43.210]  and you've got a little card from the doctor that does respirator training,
[26:43.530 --> 26:46.690]  you've already got a reason to be hired because that's one less thing I have to
[26:46.690 --> 26:50.890]  pay to have you trained and certified on. If you've got HVAC training,
[26:50.930 --> 26:56.050]  you are golden. If you've gone to any HVAC school, put that on your resume.
[26:56.610 --> 26:59.890]  If you were an electrician, and not just if you're some sort of journeyman,
[26:59.890 --> 27:00.770]  if you've got paper,
[27:00.770 --> 27:04.530]  if you've got some sort of card that says I have HVAC training or I have
[27:04.530 --> 27:09.010]  electrical training, put that down because we want to know that sort of stuff.
[27:09.730 --> 27:13.930]  We've got seven flower rooms, and that means there are seven air conditioners,
[27:14.010 --> 27:17.210]  which means there are probably 10 air conditioners because we've got bedrooms
[27:17.210 --> 27:19.970]  and a couple other things. Now, if you're a grow tech,
[27:20.330 --> 27:23.690]  you're worth a little bit of money to us. You can make some good money hourly,
[27:24.050 --> 27:27.850]  but if you're a grow tech and you're an HVAC tech and my air conditioner goes
[27:27.850 --> 27:30.650]  down and I don't have to call somebody from another service, I can say, Hey,
[27:30.650 --> 27:34.770]  bro, the HVAC in room C just went down. I'll take over watering for you.
[27:34.810 --> 27:37.330]  Can you run outside and see what's going on with the HVAC?
[27:37.610 --> 27:41.570]  And then I don't have to have the outside service come who charges by the visit
[27:41.570 --> 27:43.930]  and they charge a whole lot of money just to come look.
[27:44.170 --> 27:48.130]  If they show up and get out of the truck, it costs money, a lot of money.
[27:48.450 --> 27:53.610]  And we would be able to pay an employee a dollar or two extra per hour to have
[27:53.610 --> 27:57.650]  you as part of the staff and have you on site. So when that HVAC does go wrong,
[27:57.770 --> 28:01.610]  you're already there. I don't even have to call anybody. You just walk out there.
[28:01.810 --> 28:05.130]  You fix it, put that on the resume. So I know you've got that ability.
[28:05.330 --> 28:07.490]  You're already moving up toward the top.
[28:07.810 --> 28:10.810]  Also write down each machine that you know how to use.
[28:11.090 --> 28:12.410]  If you can use the wood chipper,
[28:12.410 --> 28:15.930]  write down that you're good with the wood chipper, anything that you can use,
[28:16.050 --> 28:18.970]  the the trim reaper, anything like that.
[28:19.530 --> 28:22.450]  Document that because we need people that can run equipment.
[28:22.450 --> 28:26.290]  The less I have to teach you, the better, the more hireable you are,
[28:26.490 --> 28:29.810]  the more you can make money right off the bat coming into a facility.
[28:30.290 --> 28:33.050]  I'll write down any thing you've got experience with.
[28:33.050 --> 28:36.090]  Like I am good with the Govita master controller.
[28:36.290 --> 28:38.010]  I can program your Govita lights.
[28:38.370 --> 28:41.410]  I know a bunch of tricks and things inside that controller that people may have
[28:41.410 --> 28:43.330]  overlooked. I've got a lot of experience with it.
[28:43.530 --> 28:44.810]  Just putting that on the resume.
[28:44.850 --> 28:48.650]  That's one more thing I can do that other people might not be able to do.
[28:49.490 --> 28:53.210]  I am familiar with the smart bees. I know how to set up the smart bee units.
[28:53.210 --> 28:55.450]  I know how to install them. I know how to program them.
[28:55.690 --> 28:57.970]  I am very familiar with smart bee technology.
[28:58.170 --> 29:00.530]  So that's another thing that is on my resume.
[29:00.890 --> 29:03.450]  I am very familiar with the link four systems.
[29:03.730 --> 29:06.490]  I have set up link four systems in multiple facilities.
[29:06.490 --> 29:08.890]  I have done troubleshooting with link four systems.
[29:08.890 --> 29:11.730]  I have been on tech support with link four before.
[29:11.730 --> 29:15.850]  I've got a relationship with link four. I know how to use their products.
[29:16.170 --> 29:18.930]  Those are really difficult machines. If you're new with them,
[29:19.450 --> 29:22.410]  I don't need to be trained on that. I'm already worth a little bit more money.
[29:22.770 --> 29:27.650]  Um, maybe you've been trained in bio track. If you know how to use bio track,
[29:27.650 --> 29:29.490]  that's, that's three weeks of training.
[29:29.490 --> 29:31.650]  We don't have to give you bio track as a little bitch.
[29:31.650 --> 29:34.610]  It takes a lot of time to learn that. If you already know how to do that,
[29:35.090 --> 29:37.450]  we're saving a lot of time metric.
[29:37.690 --> 29:42.570]  Everything in the Colorado marijuana regulated business goes through a
[29:42.570 --> 29:46.330]  thing called metric. If you have been trained or are familiar with,
[29:46.330 --> 29:49.770]  not the metric system, that's cool too. But metric is a computer system.
[29:49.770 --> 29:52.890]  If you've been trained or you're familiar with that, put that down,
[29:53.090 --> 29:56.850]  put how long you've been playing with metric and put your abilities at metric,
[29:56.850 --> 29:59.010]  what you know. And if you've done it a lot,
[29:59.010 --> 30:00.930]  you know what you need to put down to impress us,
[30:01.090 --> 30:04.730]  write that stuff down in your resume. And that makes you more valuable.
[30:04.730 --> 30:07.890]  If I don't have to train you in metric, you're already more hireable.
[30:08.050 --> 30:10.730]  You're already worth more money. There's less training to be done.
[30:10.930 --> 30:12.530]  You're already more valuable employee.
[30:13.250 --> 30:17.210]  Another thing I recommend that you can put on your resume is attend all of the
[30:17.210 --> 30:22.130]  metric classes. If you go to M E T R C.com is all I think it is.
[30:22.150 --> 30:26.170]  It's metric.com. They are a multi-state service.
[30:26.450 --> 30:29.450]  So if you have regulated cannabis in your state,
[30:29.610 --> 30:33.530]  there is probably a metric program. They will offer classes.
[30:33.970 --> 30:38.410]  A lot of the times you have to have your marijuana enforcement division badge to
[30:38.410 --> 30:43.330]  log into there. I'm not sure how each state is. Once you get your badge,
[30:43.370 --> 30:46.210]  you can log in and you can start taking metric classes.
[30:46.210 --> 30:51.090]  You may be able to take bud tending classes or grow tech classes locally or
[30:51.090 --> 30:55.170]  online without having a badge. Take those classes, document them,
[30:55.170 --> 30:58.570]  write them down, add them to your resume. The more, you know,
[30:58.690 --> 31:01.530]  the less I have to train you, the more valuable you are.
[31:01.530 --> 31:05.210]  If you can walk into the grow and start working today without shadowing me for
[31:05.210 --> 31:06.050]  four or five days,
[31:06.050 --> 31:09.050]  without having to follow Brian around and learn all of Brian's tricks.
[31:09.410 --> 31:12.090]  If you can just come in and work, you were more valuable.
[31:12.290 --> 31:13.930]  You were saving us a lot of time.
[31:14.610 --> 31:17.330]  So write down all of that stuff on your resume.
[31:17.330 --> 31:20.730]  Make sure we know who and what we're dealing with before we hire you.
[31:20.970 --> 31:24.810]  Now, another thing, if you're applying to be a trimmer, this is really important.
[31:25.210 --> 31:27.490]  If you were applying to be a trimmer in my facility,
[31:27.490 --> 31:31.970]  I am going to ask you in the very first interview, how much can you trim a day?
[31:32.330 --> 31:33.290]  We dry trim.
[31:33.690 --> 31:38.050]  If there is a guy taking a giant plant and bucking the buds off the sticks and
[31:38.050 --> 31:41.890]  handing you a five gallon bucket of nothing but buds to be trimmed,
[31:41.890 --> 31:44.250]  you don't have to do any of the work of getting it off the stick.
[31:44.250 --> 31:46.650]  The big leaves are gone. You just trim your little ass off.
[31:47.290 --> 31:49.530]  How much can you trim today in eight hours?
[31:50.250 --> 31:53.090]  We're going to go from eight to five at eight o'clock.
[31:53.090 --> 31:54.010]  We're going to start trimming.
[31:54.010 --> 31:56.970]  Your little scissors are going to get going and I want to see fire come out of
[31:56.970 --> 32:00.890]  them at 10 o'clock. I'm going to yell, stop trimming. Let's go smoke some dabs.
[32:01.170 --> 32:04.090]  We're going to go take a break. We're going to come back at 1015.
[32:04.330 --> 32:08.730]  I want you to trim it from 1015 to 12 at 12. We're taking an hour lunch.
[32:08.770 --> 32:12.530]  Do whatever you want for that hour. I'll see you at one o'clock from one until
[32:12.530 --> 32:17.530]  three scissors are on fire again, from three 15 to five scissors on fire.
[32:18.690 --> 32:20.570]  What's going on? How much can you trim?
[32:20.850 --> 32:23.290]  A lot of people look me in the face and tell me I could probably do three or
[32:23.290 --> 32:26.890]  four pounds. I had one guy tell me I could guarantee you three pounds every day.
[32:26.890 --> 32:29.090]  Dog. I hired him. Guess what?
[32:29.570 --> 32:31.970]  A motherfucker pulled out like a half a pound five days in a row.
[32:31.970 --> 32:35.250]  Guess where he works now? Not at three rivers. I don't know where he works.
[32:35.250 --> 32:38.850]  He lied to me. He told me he could do more than he could do. I believed him.
[32:38.930 --> 32:42.610]  I hired him. He fucking failed. He got fired. He was a good dude.
[32:42.890 --> 32:44.810]  He was a good worker. If you would have said, bro,
[32:44.810 --> 32:48.010]  I could probably crank out a half a pound a day and he would have came into the
[32:48.010 --> 32:50.210]  facility and cranked out a half a pound a day. Guess what?
[32:50.210 --> 32:53.010]  He would have met his quota. He would have met his standards.
[32:53.010 --> 32:56.610]  He would not have been a bullshitter and he'd still have a job. So don't lie.
[32:56.690 --> 33:00.010]  If you can only trim a half a pound a day, tell me currently,
[33:00.050 --> 33:03.610]  I only can do a half a pound a day. We'll find you tips and tricks.
[33:03.610 --> 33:07.050]  We'll get you to a pound and a half a day. You just gotta not lie to me.
[33:07.370 --> 33:10.730]  If you go to karate class and you say I'm a black belt and I find out you're a
[33:10.730 --> 33:14.010]  purple belt, I'm going to kick your ass because you lied to me.
[33:14.090 --> 33:17.530]  If you come into my grow and you say I can trim half a pound a day,
[33:17.850 --> 33:21.170]  I'm going to teach you how to be a black belt and trim a pound and a half.
[33:21.170 --> 33:23.010]  If you come in and say, I can trim two pounds,
[33:23.290 --> 33:27.050]  I expect two pounds from you every day. That's a goal you set.
[33:27.570 --> 33:31.490]  That was your goal that you, that was your expectation. Why'd you lie to me?
[33:31.730 --> 33:34.170]  You could have said a quarter pound and then you could have said,
[33:34.170 --> 33:36.770]  I could probably do a quarter pound and you would have came in and trimmed half
[33:36.770 --> 33:38.490]  a pound. I would have thought you were a fucking rockstar.
[33:38.890 --> 33:41.330]  So don't lie to anybody on your resume.
[33:41.610 --> 33:44.010]  Don't lie to get the job because we're going to find out.
[33:44.290 --> 33:45.970]  If you say I know how to do all this stuff,
[33:46.250 --> 33:48.650]  we're going to take you in the grow and we're going to say do all this stuff
[33:49.050 --> 33:50.650]  and you're going to be mixing nutrients and I'm going to say,
[33:50.650 --> 33:53.330]  what's the pH and you're going to go, how do I check the pH?
[33:53.570 --> 33:56.930]  We're going to know that you lied. So don't lie. Don't over promise.
[33:56.970 --> 33:58.810]  Always under promise over deliver.
[33:59.050 --> 34:01.930]  That's something I could definitely say would be a good idea on your resume,
[34:02.410 --> 34:06.130]  but don't set expectations that you're not going to meet because that is the
[34:06.130 --> 34:10.690]  best way to get fired way quickly in a growth facility.
[34:10.970 --> 34:12.490]  All right, so let's review really quickly.
[34:12.490 --> 34:14.490]  And then we're going to start wrapping this podcast up.
[34:14.810 --> 34:16.490]  List all of your skills,
[34:16.490 --> 34:20.290]  list any equipment you've been trained on and list all of your certifications.
[34:20.570 --> 34:22.570]  I would highly recommend getting a key badge.
[34:22.810 --> 34:24.370]  If you're going to work in the grow,
[34:24.570 --> 34:28.210]  I would recommend either worker protection safety training before you're even
[34:28.210 --> 34:32.930]  hired or a pesticide applicator license through the department of
[34:32.930 --> 34:36.930]  ag. It's one test. Uh, it's affordable and you can do it.
[34:36.930 --> 34:40.410]  Also, if you're going to do that, get respirator certified.
[34:40.410 --> 34:43.890]  If you're going to apply pesticides in Colorado and a medical or recreational
[34:43.890 --> 34:46.490]  grow, you're required to wear a respirator.
[34:46.490 --> 34:50.250]  Anybody wearing that respirator needs a respirator certification.
[34:50.250 --> 34:53.330]  It's really easy. It costs a few bucks. You go to a doctor,
[34:53.570 --> 34:57.050]  you take the respirator that you plan on using. You wear that respirator.
[34:57.210 --> 34:59.450]  They make sure that you can put, it's a fit test is what it is.
[34:59.450 --> 35:01.050]  They want to make sure you can put it on, right?
[35:01.290 --> 35:03.850]  They want to make sure you take it off safely because when you take it off,
[35:04.330 --> 35:07.570]  you got your gloves on, you've got this dirty respirator with pesticides on it.
[35:07.810 --> 35:10.010]  They want to make sure you're going to take it off in a manner that you're not
[35:10.010 --> 35:13.490]  going to spread the pesticides to your eyes or skin. Um,
[35:13.970 --> 35:18.290]  so be respirator certified. If you've got any HVAC or electrical training,
[35:18.690 --> 35:23.210]  uh, mention that, uh, if you can use any specialized devices,
[35:23.250 --> 35:26.690]  could be the controller, smart bees, link fours, mention that if you're good with
[35:26.690 --> 35:30.450]  any computer programs, bio-tracker metric, mention that if you've gone to any
[35:30.450 --> 35:33.370]  classes, please mention that if you've gone to Cloverleaf,
[35:33.370 --> 35:34.570]  if you've gone to Oakster dam,
[35:34.590 --> 35:39.490]  if you've been to any of the bud tender trainings, mention all of that. Um,
[35:40.490 --> 35:43.290]  honestly, we don't care about your pictures.
[35:43.330 --> 35:45.290]  We don't want to see any of your buds.
[35:45.770 --> 35:47.770]  You're going to prove that part when you work in the grow,
[35:47.790 --> 35:50.250]  we've already got a master grower. That's going to do that for you.
[35:50.610 --> 35:55.050]  So just write down what you can do, write down who you are.
[35:55.290 --> 35:57.890]  We can grow already. We want to know what you're able to do.
[35:57.910 --> 36:00.770]  We don't want to see your pictures. We don't want to know about your Instagram.
[36:01.210 --> 36:05.010]  Just come in with a solid resume, be on time.
[36:05.050 --> 36:09.010]  Just cause it's the weed industry. Doesn't mean you can be 15 minutes late. Um,
[36:09.450 --> 36:11.530]  don't come in super high. I get it.
[36:11.890 --> 36:13.930]  You're applying for a job in the weed industry.
[36:14.250 --> 36:16.690]  Don't come in so high that you can't look me in the face.
[36:16.850 --> 36:21.650]  Don't come in just reeking. You are applying for a job, be professional.
[36:22.130 --> 36:25.050]  And also act like you've been here before. Uh,
[36:25.090 --> 36:27.330]  act like this is not your first time at a grow.
[36:27.570 --> 36:31.290]  If I feel like the interview is going well, I will offer you a tour of the grow.
[36:31.530 --> 36:34.330]  I'm kind of checking you out at that time. I'm taking your temperature,
[36:34.330 --> 36:36.730]  seeing if you can handle being around that many plants,
[36:36.730 --> 36:39.730]  seeing if you're going to freak out, seeing how big your eyes are going to get,
[36:39.730 --> 36:41.290]  seeing if you start reaching into your pockets,
[36:41.290 --> 36:42.610]  thinking about how to steal some shit.
[36:42.930 --> 36:46.690]  I'm kind of feeling you out when I take you back to the grow to give you a tour.
[36:46.850 --> 36:48.610]  So keep yourself in check.
[36:48.650 --> 36:52.570]  Act like you've been there before and don't let things get to your head. All
[36:52.570 --> 36:55.930]  right. That's my advice for a resume. And also kind of,
[36:55.930 --> 36:59.370]  I guess for an interview when you're trying to get a job in the cannabis
[36:59.370 --> 37:01.570]  industry. Hey, I need to give a couple of shout outs,
[37:01.650 --> 37:05.330]  big shout outs to my buddy Max power, super huge star struck.

[37:09.570 --> 37:12.130]  Ray. Jarden Del Ray is a cool fucking name.

[37:16.690 --> 37:19.890]  It's like a, I don't know. It's fucking cool. I like that name.

[37:46.090 --> 37:48.970]  I've been more focused on getting the YouTube videos caught up. But anyway,
