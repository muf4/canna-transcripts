[00:00.000 --> 00:49.110]  All right, here we go.
[00:49.110 --> 00:50.590]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:50.590 --> 00:51.590]  I'm your host.
[00:51.590 --> 00:53.350]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:53.350 --> 00:58.230]  This is episode 718 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:58.230 --> 01:02.230]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on more listener emails before I get to that part
[01:02.230 --> 01:03.270]  of the show.
[01:03.270 --> 01:07.750]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who continue to support the show
[01:07.750 --> 01:09.670]  on Patreon.
[01:09.670 --> 01:13.630]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to my friend
[01:13.630 --> 01:14.790]  Freak Fish.
[01:14.790 --> 01:18.350]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to the Big Sexy Dank and Kes Burton.
[01:18.350 --> 01:22.270]  Let's send a thank you shout out to North North Terps and Josiah W. Let's send a big
[01:22.270 --> 01:25.390]  fist bump to my buddy DontTreadOnMe420.
[01:25.390 --> 01:28.030]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Ned Denver and Lefty.
[01:28.030 --> 01:31.790]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Girls Grow Too and Pac Northwest Dan.
[01:31.790 --> 01:34.710]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to ADHD Grower.
[01:34.710 --> 01:37.710]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to my buddy Zaxon Starker.
[01:37.710 --> 01:41.510]  Then let's wrap it all up with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out
[01:41.510 --> 01:44.990]  to Sacred Tree Organic Farms.
[01:44.990 --> 01:50.030]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:50.030 --> 01:53.710]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:53.710 --> 02:00.150]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:00.150 --> 02:02.990]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:02.990 --> 02:07.330]  You know I do include that link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[02:07.330 --> 02:10.250]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[02:10.250 --> 02:12.850]  I do want to send you a special Patreon thank you.
[02:12.850 --> 02:16.530]  You may have noticed on social media I did buy a new microphone.
[02:16.530 --> 02:18.410]  I call it the Mike Mike.
[02:18.410 --> 02:19.410]  That's right.
[02:19.410 --> 02:20.410]  I'm looking at it right now.
[02:20.410 --> 02:21.850]  It's over there on the production setup table.
[02:21.850 --> 02:22.930]  That's what that table is called.
[02:22.930 --> 02:24.250]  That's the official name.
[02:24.250 --> 02:25.690]  There is a new microphone.
[02:25.690 --> 02:26.690]  There's a cloud lifter.
[02:26.690 --> 02:27.690]  There's a mic stand.
[02:27.690 --> 02:28.930]  There's a set of headphones.
[02:28.930 --> 02:33.930]  We've got my call set up ready to record episode 719 and that was contributed.
[02:33.930 --> 02:34.930]  That was supported.
[02:34.930 --> 02:38.210]  Funded by the great folks from Patreon.
[02:38.210 --> 02:40.850]  A lot of people ask where that money goes, what happens to it.
[02:40.850 --> 02:42.010]  There's a good example.
[02:42.010 --> 02:43.930]  You guys bought Mike a mic.
[02:43.930 --> 02:47.250]  So thank you for the Mike Mike.
[02:47.250 --> 02:52.630]  And also big shout out to White Mike for joining me for episode 719.
[02:52.630 --> 02:54.130]  He should be here in just a couple of hours.
[02:54.130 --> 02:55.650]  We've got a great show planned for you.
[02:55.650 --> 02:58.810]  But really thank you guys for the Patreon support.
[02:58.810 --> 03:02.650]  That Patreon support does help fund things like the Mike Mike, the cloud lifter, one
[03:02.650 --> 03:03.650]  time the cloud lifter.
[03:03.650 --> 03:05.530]  That's what powers this microphone.
[03:05.530 --> 03:09.290]  The microphone runs to a thing that gives it juice and then that runs to a recording
[03:09.290 --> 03:10.290]  device.
[03:10.290 --> 03:16.090]  Patreon paid for the microphone, the mic arm, the cords, the power, the recording device,
[03:16.090 --> 03:17.850]  the editing computer.
[03:17.850 --> 03:19.750]  That is the stuff that the Patreon pays for.
[03:19.750 --> 03:25.810]  Also pays for the website, pays for the web service here so that we can post the show.
[03:25.810 --> 03:29.250]  Businessy things come out of the Patreon account to keep it, keep it a legit business.
[03:29.250 --> 03:31.130]  You guys, that's what we're trying to do.
[03:31.130 --> 03:33.410]  That is my report for the fiscal year 2021.
[03:34.170 --> 03:36.290]  I don't know why I wanted you to know what we do with the Patreon money.
[03:36.290 --> 03:39.410]  I wanted to thank you and let you know what I do with the funding that you provide.
[03:39.410 --> 03:43.090]  I try to put it back into the show in some sort of way.
[03:43.090 --> 03:46.450]  If I need equipment, there is some stuff in an account that if shit goes wrong, I can
[03:46.450 --> 03:50.810]  buy maybe an iPad, a computer, a microphone, whatever breaks, a fucking camera.
[03:50.810 --> 03:52.730]  You guys know that camera two can kiss my ass.
[03:52.730 --> 03:55.250]  We may replace that eventually.
[03:55.250 --> 03:56.250]  But there may be another camera.
[03:56.250 --> 03:57.250]  You never know.
[03:57.250 --> 03:58.250]  That's what happens with the Patreon.
[03:58.250 --> 03:59.810]  I'm high on rambling.
[03:59.810 --> 04:00.810]  Thank you.
[04:00.810 --> 04:01.810]  That is the main point here.
[04:02.330 --> 04:06.090]  I want to send another thank you to all of the people who warned me that a couple of
[04:06.090 --> 04:11.730]  the audio episodes were not posting and populating on the audio server feeds.
[04:11.730 --> 04:13.690]  I am posting it the way that I'm supposed to.
[04:13.690 --> 04:17.370]  I did what I am required, supposed to, knowledgeable of doing.
[04:17.370 --> 04:21.530]  And for some reason, the feeds just were not catching the files that I was posting.
[04:21.530 --> 04:26.770]  Some of the audio services didn't have 7, 14, 15, and possibly 16.
[04:26.770 --> 04:28.170]  That issue has been corrected.
[04:28.170 --> 04:31.770]  All of those episodes are now, to the best of my knowledge, those episodes are now in
[04:31.930 --> 04:36.570]  Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher Radio, Podbean, all that stuff.
[04:36.570 --> 04:38.770]  I cannot get Google to update.
[04:38.770 --> 04:42.810]  So if you guys are watching, listening, waiting for the show on Google Podcasts, I can't get
[04:42.810 --> 04:43.810]  it to update.
[04:43.810 --> 04:45.770]  I don't know why I've messaged them, contact customer service.
[04:45.770 --> 04:46.770]  They don't give a shit.
[04:46.770 --> 04:49.370]  So that's always going to suck and be slow there.
[04:49.370 --> 04:54.210]  Also, somebody asked why there's only so many episodes on Spotify.
[04:54.210 --> 04:55.210]  That is not up to me.
[04:55.210 --> 04:56.210]  I don't get to decide that.
[04:56.210 --> 05:00.410]  Spotify decides how much space they're going to dedicate to the show.
[05:00.410 --> 05:03.170]  Guys like Joe Rogan, they get an unlimited fucking feed.
[05:03.170 --> 05:04.670]  You can put it all up there.
[05:04.670 --> 05:11.010]  People with smaller audiences, smaller viewerships, less numbers, less clicks, they get less room
[05:11.010 --> 05:12.010]  on the feed.
[05:12.010 --> 05:15.410]  They don't think you want to listen to more than 100 episodes of my nonsense yet.
[05:15.410 --> 05:20.770]  So they only give me server space, bandwidth space, storage space for my most 100 recent
[05:20.770 --> 05:21.830]  episodes.
[05:21.830 --> 05:22.830]  That's not up to me.
[05:22.830 --> 05:24.490]  That is a Spotify issue.
[05:24.490 --> 05:28.410]  I do believe Apple Podcasts hosts like 300 of my shows, maybe more.
[05:28.410 --> 05:29.410]  I don't go check that.
[05:29.410 --> 05:30.850]  I don't have listeners tell me this sort of stuff.
[05:30.850 --> 05:36.970]  But if you are upset, frustrated, complaining, bent, vexed in some way that older episodes
[05:36.970 --> 05:39.670]  have disappeared from Spotify, I do apologize.
[05:39.670 --> 05:41.330]  That's nothing I can control.
[05:41.330 --> 05:44.770]  Until we get more listens, more viewership, then they will add our library.
[05:44.770 --> 05:46.170]  It will be much longer.
[05:46.170 --> 05:48.330]  But until then, that's just what they do.
[05:48.330 --> 05:52.630]  In the meantime, you can check out all of the episodes on the YouTube channel.
[05:52.630 --> 05:57.090]  Every episode up till from like episode 20, I think all the way up, should be on the YouTube
[05:57.090 --> 06:01.730]  server and the older episodes are on the old channel, iGrow Culture, which has been
[06:01.730 --> 06:04.050]  defunct and that I think I shared them somewhere.
[06:04.050 --> 06:08.250]  You should be able to find everything on the Grow From Your Heart podcast, YouTube.
[06:08.250 --> 06:09.250]  It should all be there.
[06:09.250 --> 06:10.250]  Check it out there.
[06:10.250 --> 06:13.890]  Also, click like and subscribe because that's where the numbers count the most for me when
[06:13.890 --> 06:16.570]  I'm doing advertising and promotion and sales.
[06:16.570 --> 06:17.970]  People want to see the YouTube numbers.
[06:17.970 --> 06:18.970]  That's where it counts.
[06:18.970 --> 06:19.970]  So do that.
[06:19.970 --> 06:23.370]  Also, the main point here was thank you to everybody that lets me know that sometimes
[06:23.370 --> 06:24.450]  the shows aren't populating.
[06:24.450 --> 06:26.130]  I don't know because I don't watch the show.
[06:26.170 --> 06:27.170]  I don't listen to the show.
[06:27.170 --> 06:28.730]  I do make sure that YouTube comes up.
[06:28.730 --> 06:31.610]  The other servers I can't check on as regularly.
[06:31.610 --> 06:33.370]  So I do rely on you and I do thank you.
[06:33.370 --> 06:37.410]  I'm grateful for the teamwork that you guys do provide me for letting me know that my
[06:37.410 --> 06:40.050]  show did not populate on some servers.
[06:40.050 --> 06:41.050]  All right.
[06:41.050 --> 06:42.530]  I do have more notes to cover.
[06:42.530 --> 06:46.250]  I am almost ready for more testers.
[06:46.250 --> 06:49.770]  I know I'm opening the fucking floodgates for my email inbox here.
[06:49.770 --> 06:51.730]  Here it comes, but I am ready.
[06:51.730 --> 06:53.510]  I've got more seeds coming.
[06:53.510 --> 06:54.510]  We made more seeds.
[06:54.510 --> 06:55.510]  We're making more seeds.
[06:55.890 --> 06:56.890]  I know we have more seeds in progress.
[06:56.890 --> 07:02.030]  I say we because I talk about I make and touch every single seed that comes from iRegenetics.
[07:02.030 --> 07:03.550]  I do have some helpers now.
[07:03.550 --> 07:04.870]  I needed more space.
[07:04.870 --> 07:06.830]  I'm using spaces to make more seeds.
[07:06.830 --> 07:08.510]  It will work out for everybody.
[07:08.510 --> 07:12.110]  It's all Rasta Jeff Touched, approved and done, but we needed more spaces.
[07:12.110 --> 07:13.270]  We are expanding the team.
[07:13.270 --> 07:14.270]  Don't worry.
[07:14.270 --> 07:16.490]  Quality control will be everything it has been.
[07:16.490 --> 07:20.510]  That being said, I need more testers to maintain quality control.
[07:20.510 --> 07:21.510]  There's a podcast.
[07:21.510 --> 07:23.070]  Let me find that before I even go any further.
[07:23.070 --> 07:24.930]  I'll tell you which episode it is.
[07:25.350 --> 07:27.970]  There's a Grow From Your Heart podcast tester episode.
[07:27.970 --> 07:29.290]  I'm typing in that right now.
[07:29.290 --> 07:31.010]  All right, check out episode.
[07:31.010 --> 07:36.450]  If you would like to be a tester, the first step to test seeds for iRegenetics, number
[07:36.450 --> 07:40.190]  one, the prerequisite, you don't qualify until you do this.
[07:40.190 --> 07:47.650]  You must watch and pay close attention to episode 590 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[07:47.650 --> 07:50.610]  That episode is all about becoming a seed tester for my brand.
[07:50.610 --> 07:53.890]  If you'd like to test for me, that is the very first step.
[07:53.890 --> 07:56.610]  Check out episode 590 of this podcast.
[07:56.610 --> 07:58.070]  It's here on YouTube.
[07:58.070 --> 07:59.070]  Check it out.
[07:59.070 --> 08:00.070]  That will help you a lot.
[08:00.070 --> 08:02.930]  Once you watch that, you'll be given some hints and tips and you'll know more what to
[08:02.930 --> 08:03.930]  do.
[08:03.930 --> 08:07.410]  The next thing I will require you to do is to join my Discord.
[08:07.410 --> 08:12.070]  I would really like to have all of the testers on Discord in the Discord tab.
[08:12.070 --> 08:17.330]  That helps me out tremendously when looking for test reports, for info, for details, for
[08:17.330 --> 08:18.330]  photos.
[08:18.330 --> 08:19.330]  I can go to one place.
[08:19.330 --> 08:20.330]  It is all there.
[08:20.330 --> 08:21.990]  It really makes it easy.
[08:21.990 --> 08:23.410]  Watch the episode.
[08:23.430 --> 08:24.890]  Join my Discord.
[08:24.890 --> 08:27.890]  Post in the tester tab that you have watched the videos.
[08:27.890 --> 08:30.930]  That lets me know you're paying attention and following instructions.
[08:30.930 --> 08:32.950]  There are more steps.
[08:32.950 --> 08:36.290]  You will get those steps when you follow these proper instructions.
[08:36.290 --> 08:39.630]  The reason I make you follow instructions is because I'm not giving out free seeds to
[08:39.630 --> 08:40.630]  give out free seeds.
[08:40.630 --> 08:43.490]  I expect things in return for these seeds.
[08:43.490 --> 08:45.090]  I need detailed reports.
[08:45.090 --> 08:46.090]  I need feedback.
[08:46.090 --> 08:47.090]  I need communication.
[08:47.090 --> 08:51.350]  If you can't follow a few instructions to get these seeds, I can't fuck with you to
[08:51.350 --> 08:52.410]  give you free seeds.
[08:52.410 --> 08:53.410]  That's just how it is.
[08:53.410 --> 08:56.970]  A little bit of work to get you some beans to show you qualify to be on the team is all
[08:56.970 --> 08:57.970]  this is.
[08:57.970 --> 09:00.090]  So, listen to the episode.
[09:00.090 --> 09:01.370]  Join the Discord.
[09:01.370 --> 09:04.130]  Send the correct email the way it's been asked for.
[09:04.130 --> 09:06.570]  Then wait for a reply.
[09:06.570 --> 09:11.950]  Please do not feel like I have ignored you, blown you off, discredited you if I do not
[09:11.950 --> 09:13.810]  reply promptly.
[09:13.810 --> 09:17.750]  I am only looking for a certain amount of testers at this time.
[09:17.750 --> 09:21.290]  And I'm going to get an overwhelming amount of responses.
[09:21.290 --> 09:26.050]  If I don't reply to you, if I don't send you a message, just wait because this is one
[09:26.050 --> 09:28.850]  phase of testing that is going to happen this year.
[09:28.850 --> 09:33.170]  And I will do many, many phases of testing.
[09:33.170 --> 09:36.770]  If I don't fuck with you this time and you send me a bunch of messages saying, why didn't
[09:36.770 --> 09:37.770]  you pick me?
[09:37.770 --> 09:38.770]  Why didn't you pick me?
[09:38.770 --> 09:40.410]  I won't pick you next time.
[09:40.410 --> 09:43.210]  If you're cool about it, I may pick you next time randomly.
[09:43.210 --> 09:44.530]  It could be two weeks.
[09:44.530 --> 09:45.530]  It could be two months.
[09:45.530 --> 09:51.010]  I may just say, oh, listener number 7,504 sent an email and they want to be a tester.
[09:51.010 --> 09:52.010]  And I like their app.
[09:52.010 --> 09:53.010]  It's at the top of the list.
[09:53.010 --> 09:55.770]  They didn't qualify the last two phases because I had my number.
[09:55.770 --> 09:56.770]  That's all it is.
[09:56.770 --> 09:57.770]  I reach a number of testers.
[09:57.770 --> 09:58.770]  I send them.
[09:58.770 --> 09:59.970]  I wait for reports to start coming.
[09:59.970 --> 10:02.050]  Once I'm satisfied, I send more.
[10:02.050 --> 10:05.770]  It's kind of just phases, timing, when I've got timing, when I need it.
[10:05.770 --> 10:07.370]  You may be at the top of the list.
[10:07.370 --> 10:08.370]  So just wait.
[10:08.370 --> 10:09.370]  You may be on the next phase.
[10:09.370 --> 10:11.810]  I'll send you a message saying, hey, bro, you ready to be a tester?
[10:11.810 --> 10:12.810]  Do you have room?
[10:12.810 --> 10:13.810]  And if you do, guess what?
[10:13.810 --> 10:14.930]  Now is your chance.
[10:14.930 --> 10:19.330]  So do not get discouraged if I don't reach out to let you test right the fuck now.
[10:19.330 --> 10:20.870]  It may be in the near future.
[10:20.930 --> 10:22.390]  You may be at the top of the list.
[10:22.390 --> 10:25.310]  I may be waiting for you for a specific reason.
[10:25.310 --> 10:26.970]  Maybe I know that you do a certain thing.
[10:26.970 --> 10:30.030]  Maybe I know you don't do a certain thing and I need that coming up.
[10:30.030 --> 10:31.030]  Be patient.
[10:31.030 --> 10:34.190]  Don't blow your slot by blowing me up with too many negative emails.
[10:34.190 --> 10:35.710]  I understand we all get impatient.
[10:35.710 --> 10:36.710]  We all get eager.
[10:36.710 --> 10:37.710]  I get it.
[10:37.710 --> 10:38.990]  It's just me.
[10:38.990 --> 10:45.590]  I am the one packaging the tester seeds, selecting the testers, reading the email applications,
[10:45.590 --> 10:49.610]  loading up the beans into packages, putting them in shipping, checking the test reports.
[10:49.610 --> 10:50.610]  It's just me.
[10:51.350 --> 10:52.350]  So be patient.
[10:52.350 --> 10:53.350]  There are a lot of you, one of me.
[10:53.350 --> 10:56.130]  I love each and every one of you, but we've got to work together.
[10:56.130 --> 10:59.090]  Also, I said this is not the only phase.
[10:59.090 --> 11:00.970]  I may randomly select you next time.
[11:00.970 --> 11:02.090]  So be patient.
[11:02.090 --> 11:04.770]  There are a lot of regular seeds out there being tested now.
[11:04.770 --> 11:09.410]  If you're following the Discord tester group, you know that I've got three testers out there
[11:09.410 --> 11:11.490]  right now that people finally kind of know what they've got.
[11:11.490 --> 11:13.010]  I revealed what they've got.
[11:13.010 --> 11:15.090]  I waited a long time to tell people.
[11:15.090 --> 11:19.170]  There's a Bubba Kush to Arise that has been in testing and is going to pass that will
[11:19.170 --> 11:20.170]  be released.
[11:20.730 --> 11:22.410]  I've decided the name of that one.
[11:22.410 --> 11:28.450]  There is Arise F1 number 4 cross to Jack the Ripper that will pass testing.
[11:28.450 --> 11:29.450]  I approve.
[11:29.450 --> 11:30.450]  I've got a name for that.
[11:30.450 --> 11:31.450]  You guys will love the name.
[11:31.450 --> 11:33.090]  I'll tell you the names of that in the future.
[11:33.090 --> 11:37.710]  And there's another one that people can't figure out quite what the cross is.
[11:37.710 --> 11:40.770]  That one is going to pass testing also so far it looks like.
[11:40.770 --> 11:43.450]  But there's a lot of regular seeds in testing now.
[11:43.450 --> 11:45.770]  I've got new regular seeds coming soon.
[11:45.770 --> 11:47.330]  They will be released.
[11:47.330 --> 11:50.810]  People announced the names of the things I just told you about pretty soon.
[11:50.810 --> 11:55.330]  I am personally making more of the older stuff that needs restocks.
[11:55.330 --> 11:57.730]  The Golden Goats, the Lemon Jefferies, the Orange Gas.
[11:57.730 --> 11:59.290]  I'm making more of that.
[11:59.290 --> 12:03.570]  Also making more Blue Pill and Red Pill for official release.
[12:03.570 --> 12:05.050]  Also more stuff in there.
[12:05.050 --> 12:06.610]  There could be...
[12:06.610 --> 12:11.770]  Do I tell you that I put Chernobyl in the room to get pollinated by a reversed Golden
[12:11.770 --> 12:12.770]  Goat?
[12:12.770 --> 12:13.770]  Do I tell you that I did that?
[12:13.770 --> 12:14.770]  Do we talk about that?
[12:14.770 --> 12:15.770]  Anyway, we're going to move forward.
[12:15.770 --> 12:17.090]  I will not tell you the name idea that I have.
[12:17.850 --> 12:18.850]  That will need to be tested.
[12:18.850 --> 12:22.930]  Also I'm making new Femmes in another location that you guys don't even know about.
[12:22.930 --> 12:29.690]  We have reversed a plant and we have pollinated the Gorilla Glue 4, the Chem 4, possibly Blue
[12:29.690 --> 12:31.270]  Raspberry Truffle.
[12:31.270 --> 12:34.410]  Quite a few things with a reversal to make some great Femmes.
[12:34.410 --> 12:35.850]  Those will need testing very soon.
[12:35.850 --> 12:38.890]  They're being harvested now, being packaged up.
[12:38.890 --> 12:40.650]  As soon as they're ready, we'll get them out for testing.
[12:40.650 --> 12:42.610]  There's a lot of great shit coming up.
[12:42.610 --> 12:45.010]  Lots of testing and restocking to be done.
[12:45.010 --> 12:46.010]  Don't be discouraged.
[12:46.010 --> 12:47.010]  Don't get shy.
[12:47.050 --> 12:51.410]  Don't send too many hate mails if you don't get selected to be a tester right now.
[12:51.410 --> 12:52.490]  There are more phases coming.
[12:52.490 --> 12:55.130]  A lot of opportunity this year to be a tester.
[12:55.130 --> 12:59.170]  If you're already a tester and you'd like to test again, if you've done what you consider
[12:59.170 --> 13:02.370]  a successful test run, reach out on the Discord.
[13:02.370 --> 13:04.810]  Now is a good time to get yourself in line.
[13:04.810 --> 13:09.330]  If you've already done testing and you've got a recommendation for another tester, send
[13:09.330 --> 13:10.410]  me that recommendation.
[13:10.410 --> 13:13.890]  If they have applied and you recommended them and you're already on the team, that does
[13:13.890 --> 13:14.890]  help you out.
[13:14.890 --> 13:16.290]  But be careful with your recommendations.
[13:16.330 --> 13:19.170]  Don't taint your reputation.
[13:19.170 --> 13:20.170]  I said taint.
[13:20.170 --> 13:21.450]  All right, let's keep moving forward.
[13:21.450 --> 13:23.410]  I've been talking about testing for a long time.
[13:23.410 --> 13:26.450]  This was not meant to be a testing episode, but here we are.
[13:26.450 --> 13:32.450]  I want to remind you about the Groovy Gravy Secret Stash Seed Event coming up in Denver.
[13:32.450 --> 13:33.450]  That's right.
[13:33.450 --> 13:35.290]  I've got all of the details right here in front of me.
[13:35.290 --> 13:36.290]  Let me pull that up.
[13:36.290 --> 13:37.770]  I did not prepare and put that on my screen.
[13:37.770 --> 13:40.890]  Okay, I magically remember the date because of technology.
[13:40.890 --> 13:43.450]  March 26th in Denver, Colorado.
[13:43.450 --> 13:48.170]  The Groovy Gravy Secret Stash Seed Event will be happening once again.
[13:48.170 --> 13:53.610]  I read genetics, premium seeds, and many other of your favorite top seed makers will be there
[13:53.610 --> 13:54.930]  slaying in the beans.
[13:54.930 --> 13:59.150]  Come grab some seeds, possibly get some t-shirts, get a hug, get a high five, take a selfie
[13:59.150 --> 14:00.150]  with me.
[14:00.150 --> 14:01.150]  Come meet.
[14:01.150 --> 14:02.150]  I read genetics.
[14:02.150 --> 14:03.270]  White Mike should be there if things work out.
[14:03.270 --> 14:05.210]  Who knows who else I might bring.
[14:05.210 --> 14:06.210]  It'll be a good time.
[14:06.210 --> 14:07.210]  I'll be there.
[14:07.210 --> 14:08.690]  High five and given hugs, given kisses.
[14:08.690 --> 14:12.870]  I do not think it is a consumption friendly event, so I will not be given dabs.
[14:13.290 --> 14:14.510]  I will not show up.
[14:14.510 --> 14:15.510]  Let's have a good time.
[14:15.510 --> 14:20.230]  I will have Saka Souffle, The Machine, Blue Raspberry Truffle, Lady Marmalade, Strawberry
[14:20.230 --> 14:24.690]  Starburst, Sun Kiss, and possibly some of these new femmes that I've been teasing you
[14:24.690 --> 14:26.370]  about to share.
[14:26.370 --> 14:27.430]  Come join the party.
[14:27.430 --> 14:28.430]  Don't miss it.
[14:28.430 --> 14:32.670]  Check out Groovy Gravy on Instagram for more information and just follow me on Instagram.
[14:32.670 --> 14:36.310]  I'll be posting more stuff about the Groovy Gravy event very soon.
[14:36.310 --> 14:40.710]  I'm looking to see where I can lead you, but so far I think Groovy Gravy is the way to
[14:40.710 --> 14:41.710]  go.
[14:41.710 --> 14:42.710]  Don't miss the event, you guys.
[14:43.550 --> 14:44.550]  I look forward to being there.
[14:44.550 --> 14:45.550]  I look forward to seeing you.
[14:45.550 --> 14:46.550]  Last year was a huge success.
[14:46.550 --> 14:47.550]  You saw the photos.
[14:47.550 --> 14:48.550]  People were mad they missed it.
[14:48.550 --> 14:51.190]  Don't be mad at yourself for missing it this year.
[14:51.190 --> 14:52.190]  Join the party.
[14:52.190 --> 14:56.470]  All right, I think that covers all of the business and rambles here at the start of
[14:56.470 --> 14:57.470]  the show.
[14:57.470 --> 15:00.550]  I know that was a long time, but we got a lot of ground covered.
[15:00.550 --> 15:03.470]  Let's talk about some of these emails that I have received recently.
[15:03.470 --> 15:05.690]  My inboxes have been blowing up.
[15:05.690 --> 15:07.550]  Please do not stop sending me messages.
[15:07.550 --> 15:12.630]  Like I said before, it's just me, so if I don't reply right away, I apologize, but occasionally
[15:13.050 --> 15:16.470]  I'll stay up super late and just answer a bunch of emails and get a lot of shit done.
[15:16.470 --> 15:18.310]  I may reply to you.
[15:18.310 --> 15:19.310]  Don't get mad.
[15:19.310 --> 15:20.310]  Don't get upset.
[15:20.310 --> 15:23.790]  I do appreciate the messages and I love that grow help tab on the website.
[15:23.790 --> 15:24.790]  Let's get down to business.
[15:24.790 --> 15:26.610]  We've got a couple of emails here in front of me.
[15:26.610 --> 15:29.250]  This one came from Anonymous.
[15:29.250 --> 15:31.670]  We don't have a name on here, no signature.
[15:31.670 --> 15:35.330]  This one says, yo, Rasta Jeff, just wanted to let you know I've been watching since a
[15:35.330 --> 15:37.430]  little bit before episode 700.
[15:37.430 --> 15:38.750]  Well, welcome to the party, bro.
[15:38.750 --> 15:40.250]  I'm glad you're joining us.
[15:40.250 --> 15:43.730]  It says, I just want to say, man, I really have been enjoying the shows.
[15:43.730 --> 15:46.050]  I'm a longtime smoker, never grown.
[15:46.050 --> 15:49.370]  I'm debating on whether I should do it in my apartment or wait till I get a house.
[15:49.370 --> 15:50.730]  I'd say wait till you get the house, bro.
[15:50.730 --> 15:51.730]  Wait till you get a house.
[15:51.730 --> 15:54.630]  But in the meantime, I'm loving watching your show.
[15:54.630 --> 15:57.570]  You're very entertaining and funny as fuck.
[15:57.570 --> 15:59.770]  I appreciate that, bro.
[15:59.770 --> 16:03.650]  It's not a comedy show, but I do feel like I hate learning.
[16:03.650 --> 16:04.650]  I love learning.
[16:04.650 --> 16:05.650]  I hated school.
[16:05.650 --> 16:10.170]  I hate being bombarded with information that makes my brain frazzled and confused.
[16:10.170 --> 16:12.290]  And in school, I didn't care about half the shit they were teaching.
[16:12.290 --> 16:14.330]  I love these kind of lessons.
[16:14.330 --> 16:18.930]  But it makes your brain work better if you get a joke and some laughter in the middle.
[16:18.930 --> 16:19.930]  It's like a treat.
[16:19.930 --> 16:20.930]  It's like training a dog.
[16:20.930 --> 16:25.250]  If I run you through the obstacle course, make you sit, stay, lay down, roll over, jump
[16:25.250 --> 16:29.210]  over this thing, crawl under this thing, give you a treat, it works a lot better.
[16:29.210 --> 16:31.730]  If I don't ever give you the treat, I'm just fucking abusing you.
[16:31.730 --> 16:35.610]  So I feel like a little laughter, a little fun, that's a treat for your brain.
[16:35.610 --> 16:37.370]  It works better with a smile on their face.
[16:37.370 --> 16:39.890]  A joke will make everybody smile.
[16:39.890 --> 16:43.170]  So I'm glad you're digging the jokes, the funny part of the vibe here.
[16:43.170 --> 16:45.050]  I do have a comedian spirit.
[16:45.050 --> 16:46.170]  Comedy is one of my favorite things.
[16:46.170 --> 16:47.170]  You guys know me.
[16:47.170 --> 16:49.290]  I love to go to comedy shows and see comedy.
[16:49.290 --> 16:51.370]  Comedy, best thing on the planet.
[16:51.370 --> 16:53.290]  One of the best things on the planet.
[16:53.290 --> 16:55.050]  Comedy, laughter is medicine.
[16:55.050 --> 16:56.050]  Let me keep going.
[16:56.050 --> 16:57.050]  I'm fucking rambling.
[16:57.050 --> 16:58.050]  Funny as fuck.
[16:58.050 --> 17:02.010]  My wife doesn't even smoke, but she watches with me because you're fucking hilarious.
[17:02.010 --> 17:03.010]  Keep up the great work, man.
[17:03.330 --> 17:04.930]  Can't wait to get some seeds from you.
[17:04.930 --> 17:09.130]  Much love, bro, dude, and your wife, Mrs. Bro.
[17:09.130 --> 17:10.130]  And dude, thank you.
[17:10.130 --> 17:11.130]  I'm glad you guys are loving the show.
[17:11.130 --> 17:13.090]  I'm glad you guys are watching together.
[17:13.090 --> 17:15.490]  Cannot wait for you to get that new house together.
[17:15.490 --> 17:19.410]  Get growing, get shit going so you guys can both listen to the show and then get in the
[17:19.410 --> 17:20.810]  garden together.
[17:20.810 --> 17:23.850]  Make it a bonding experience with, did you say wife or girlfriend?
[17:23.850 --> 17:24.850]  Where are we?
[17:24.850 --> 17:25.850]  Wife.
[17:25.850 --> 17:26.850]  Make it a bonding experience with the wife.
[17:26.850 --> 17:28.130]  You can bring your girlfriend too if your wife allows you.
[17:28.130 --> 17:29.250]  Hey, don't slap him for that.
[17:29.250 --> 17:30.690]  I said it.
[17:31.570 --> 17:33.370]  Make it a bonding experience in the grow space there.
[17:33.370 --> 17:35.410]  You can grow your medicine together.
[17:35.410 --> 17:36.970]  Maybe grow some his and hers meds.
[17:36.970 --> 17:40.450]  Bro, maybe I challenge you to let her grow a couple of plants that you don't fuck with
[17:40.450 --> 17:42.610]  and you grow a couple that she don't fuck with.
[17:42.610 --> 17:45.850]  You guys have your own and I bet you she'll be a better grower than you because the women
[17:45.850 --> 17:49.450]  have a special touch when it comes to the ganja plants, to all plants, dude.
[17:49.450 --> 17:50.450]  They just, they're magical.
[17:50.450 --> 17:53.430]  So let the wife get in there once you get that grow going.
[17:53.430 --> 17:55.070]  And bro, thank you for the great compliments.
[17:55.070 --> 17:56.070]  Thank you for listening.
[17:56.070 --> 17:58.650]  I'm glad you find me entertaining and funny as fuck.
[17:58.650 --> 18:01.010]  I also love it that the wife is listening and watching.
[18:01.010 --> 18:02.570]  I love knowing people are doing shit together.
[18:02.570 --> 18:03.890]  Big vibes, big love.
[18:03.890 --> 18:04.890]  Keep watching you guys.
[18:04.890 --> 18:10.410]  So when you get that grow going, I look forward to all of your cultivation and cannabis culture
[18:10.410 --> 18:11.410]  questions.
[18:11.410 --> 18:12.410]  They didn't sign it.
[18:12.410 --> 18:13.410]  There's no name here.
[18:13.410 --> 18:15.930]  So big shout out to my new anonymous couple friends.
[18:15.930 --> 18:16.970]  All right.
[18:16.970 --> 18:18.930]  This one came from Patreon.
[18:18.930 --> 18:20.730]  This one is from our buddy Terp Goonie.
[18:20.730 --> 18:23.370]  We gave Terp Goonie a shout out on the last episode.
[18:23.370 --> 18:26.690]  This bad motherfucker has an Irie Army tattoo.
[18:26.690 --> 18:29.250]  He's got the cross with Irie Army above it.
[18:29.250 --> 18:30.410]  I don't even have that.
[18:30.410 --> 18:33.250]  So he's cooler than me right now.
[18:33.250 --> 18:34.570]  He sent a compliment.
[18:34.570 --> 18:39.750]  It says your pendant on the 712 episode is fucking awesome.
[18:39.750 --> 18:40.750]  That is straight fire.
[18:40.750 --> 18:43.810]  I'm going to move the microphone out of the way, kind of show you the pendant for a moment,
[18:43.810 --> 18:45.610]  then we'll get right back to the podcast.
[18:45.610 --> 18:47.890]  But I agree this pendant is straight fucking fire.
[18:47.890 --> 18:50.890]  I may just drop in a photo of it because moving the mic might not do a lot, but here's what
[18:50.890 --> 18:54.790]  it looks like.
[18:54.790 --> 19:01.670]  It is a number of pastel like colors and what looks to be like a bloom type of a flower,
[19:01.670 --> 19:03.550]  possibly a lotus might've been what they were going for.
[19:03.550 --> 19:07.870]  I just realized that as I'm looking at it at this angle with an ohm sign in the middle
[19:07.870 --> 19:08.870]  of it, right?
[19:08.870 --> 19:10.630]  It says ohm right in the middle of it.
[19:10.630 --> 19:12.430]  I saw this at a glass shop.
[19:12.430 --> 19:16.070]  I actually saw two of them and I thought, I know somebody that would love that.
[19:16.070 --> 19:18.350]  I'm going to get us those matching pendants.
[19:18.350 --> 19:22.310]  And so big shout out to the person who has the other pendant that looks just like this.
[19:22.310 --> 19:24.010]  She knows who she is.
[19:24.010 --> 19:25.570]  She doesn't want the shout out on the show.
[19:25.570 --> 19:28.610]  She's kind of shy, but had to grab the pendee.
[19:28.610 --> 19:32.290]  There was another person out there rocking a match to this and I think it's super awesome.
[19:32.290 --> 19:35.890]  This came from our friend, a glass by Blake on Instagram.
[19:35.890 --> 19:39.130]  Check out glass underscore by underscore Blake on Instagram.
[19:39.130 --> 19:40.710]  He makes a lot of great shit.
[19:40.710 --> 19:42.010]  There's more stuff I'm going to buy.
[19:42.010 --> 19:44.530]  He's got a Murakami pendee that I've really got my eye on.
[19:44.530 --> 19:45.530]  I think he may have sold it.
[19:45.530 --> 19:51.370]  That may be a blessing in disguise or a blessing in the skies depending on who you are.
[19:51.490 --> 19:54.890]  Big shout out to Blake Wingard Glass, Glass by Blake for the pendee.
[19:54.890 --> 19:59.550]  And big thanks to my buddy Terp Goonie for noticing the dope pendant.
[19:59.550 --> 20:02.050]  Also shout out to Positively Vibes in Denver.
[20:02.050 --> 20:03.330]  That's where I picked it up.
[20:03.330 --> 20:05.210]  Great place, great folks there.
[20:05.210 --> 20:06.210]  The owner is super cool.
[20:06.210 --> 20:07.650]  The staff is super cool.
[20:07.650 --> 20:10.290]  Hedy Glass, kicking ass.
[20:10.290 --> 20:12.730]  I don't know why I even said that, but the place is cool.
[20:12.730 --> 20:13.730]  Let's keep going.
[20:13.730 --> 20:14.730]  I do have a question here.
[20:14.730 --> 20:15.730]  This is the one I'm looking for.
[20:15.730 --> 20:16.970]  Why did I get my notes mixed up?
[20:16.970 --> 20:18.730]  You guys saw it happen.
[20:18.730 --> 20:21.210]  This one comes from our friend Andrew.
[20:21.210 --> 20:23.930]  And Andrew says, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[20:23.930 --> 20:26.890]  I recently finished my first run of producing seeds.
[20:26.890 --> 20:29.170]  Isn't that a fun, exciting project?
[20:29.170 --> 20:31.050]  Except this ends in tragedy.
[20:31.050 --> 20:32.050]  This is a tragedy.
[20:32.050 --> 20:33.210]  I will warn you.
[20:33.210 --> 20:37.770]  It says it was dark hollow or it was a fun and unexpected project.
[20:37.770 --> 20:39.410]  And then I jumped ahead of line.
[20:39.410 --> 20:43.450]  While I was popping a bag of dark hollow, I stumbled upon the stinkiest male plant I've
[20:43.450 --> 20:44.970]  ever smelled.
[20:44.970 --> 20:46.970]  That one's going to have some stinky bitches in there.
[20:46.970 --> 20:49.650]  That dark hollow male plant was probably a champ.
[20:49.650 --> 20:53.690]  It says great structure, vigorous and an intense garlicky funk.
[20:53.690 --> 20:55.170]  That's hard to describe.
[20:55.170 --> 20:59.410]  I love it, but I can almost smell it in my mind because I know that plant so well.
[20:59.410 --> 21:00.410]  It goes on.
[21:00.410 --> 21:04.650]  It says I happen to have an extra Xanadu female and some extra space.
[21:04.650 --> 21:05.970]  I know what's going to happen here, bro.
[21:05.970 --> 21:07.250]  You put them on a date.
[21:07.250 --> 21:08.250]  Quick summary.
[21:08.250 --> 21:09.490]  It says I kept them very small.
[21:09.490 --> 21:12.050]  And then he does go on to kind of describe the grow a little bit.
[21:12.050 --> 21:16.530]  Fabric pots, soil, synthetic help, Mars hydro.
[21:16.530 --> 21:17.530]  Everything seemed to be great.
[21:17.530 --> 21:18.530]  Very healthy all the way through.
[21:18.530 --> 21:21.450]  I got a ton of very healthy looking seeds.
[21:21.450 --> 21:23.450]  But here's where we turn to tragedy.
[21:23.450 --> 21:24.450]  Tragedy.
[21:24.450 --> 21:25.850]  I think it's a tragedy.
[21:25.850 --> 21:26.890]  However you want to say it.
[21:26.890 --> 21:28.890]  This is where the fucked up part happens.
[21:28.890 --> 21:32.370]  But the seeds have shells made of vibranium.
[21:32.370 --> 21:37.130]  After several attempts at every method of germinating, soaking, scarring, scraping,
[21:37.130 --> 21:41.250]  cracking, et cetera, I finally got two seeds to crack through the shell.
[21:41.250 --> 21:44.290]  And this was about after 25 attempts.
[21:44.290 --> 21:47.970]  After examining the other failed tries, it appears that the seed was trying to push the
[21:47.970 --> 21:52.250]  root through, but none of them were capable of cracking the seed shell.
[21:52.250 --> 21:53.370]  Yes, that does make sense.
[21:53.370 --> 21:54.890]  I've got a reason why.
[21:54.890 --> 21:57.610]  And possibly another test or solution you could try.
[21:57.610 --> 22:00.810]  It says I usually have good germination techniques.
[22:00.810 --> 22:03.090]  Any idea what I may have done to cause this?
[22:03.090 --> 22:04.090]  I love your show.
[22:04.090 --> 22:05.170]  I love your seeds.
[22:05.170 --> 22:06.610]  Love your vibe in general.
[22:06.610 --> 22:09.250]  Be well from my new friend, Andrew.
[22:09.250 --> 22:10.970]  Andrew, big love, big respect.
[22:10.970 --> 22:12.090]  Thank you for the great question.
[22:12.130 --> 22:15.410]  I do have feedback, perhaps possibly an answer here.
[22:15.410 --> 22:19.370]  Let's talk about what I think could have gone wrong in your grow.
[22:19.370 --> 22:22.330]  Number one answer, I think you let the seeds go for too long.
[22:22.330 --> 22:24.410]  They should have been harvested earlier.
[22:24.410 --> 22:28.090]  They simply got too thick, too tough, too strong because they were there too long.
[22:28.090 --> 22:29.090]  I've seen this happen.
[22:29.090 --> 22:31.050]  I've done this.
[22:31.050 --> 22:35.530]  There's not much you can do now except next time cut them down earlier.
[22:35.530 --> 22:39.570]  Maybe go through and find the seeds you think might really germ, pull those out, try them.
[22:39.770 --> 22:42.250]  Also, I've seen a thing called a seed cracker.
[22:42.250 --> 22:44.810]  You could probably do it with a pair of pliers or whatever else you got, but you're going
[22:44.810 --> 22:46.290]  to fuck up some seeds doing it.
[22:46.290 --> 22:49.770]  There's a little device that you put a seed in it and you twist a handle and the seed
[22:49.770 --> 22:52.410]  goes crack and it kind of pops the shell for you.
[22:52.410 --> 22:54.210]  Then you attempt to germ it.
[22:54.210 --> 22:55.210]  That may work for you.
[22:55.210 --> 22:56.210]  That may help you out.
[22:56.210 --> 23:00.090]  But the bottom line, the real answer here, straight up without any bullshit, without
[23:00.090 --> 23:04.250]  buttering it up, without sugar coating it, I think those seeds grew for too long and
[23:04.250 --> 23:06.970]  they're all going to be probably problematic.
[23:06.970 --> 23:08.970]  It could be a silicate issue.
[23:08.970 --> 23:10.290]  It could be a feed issue.
[23:10.290 --> 23:11.850]  It could be something like that.
[23:11.850 --> 23:15.450]  Honestly, I'm going to say that this was a timing issue.
[23:15.450 --> 23:19.650]  Those seeds simply, they went too long and they got too hard and now they're just too
[23:19.650 --> 23:21.090]  hard and too tough and too thick.
[23:21.090 --> 23:25.290]  That's really what I do think happened to your seeds.
[23:25.290 --> 23:26.490]  I wish I had better advice.
[23:26.490 --> 23:29.570]  I wish I had info on how to correct that because you've got a batch of seeds.
[23:29.570 --> 23:30.890]  I don't know how many you made.
[23:30.890 --> 23:34.810]  It doesn't really say, but you bought 25 of them, so you must have a nice number.
[23:34.810 --> 23:37.930]  When you make seeds, you guys, you make a lot of seeds.
[23:37.930 --> 23:39.490]  You probably got a lot to play with.
[23:39.490 --> 23:43.610]  It's a bummer that it's not a winner, but it's cool that it was just kind of a side
[23:43.610 --> 23:45.450]  project that you did learn from.
[23:45.450 --> 23:47.210]  Take this as a learning lesson.
[23:47.210 --> 23:48.210]  How long did you flower?
[23:48.210 --> 23:50.090]  Did you take notes?
[23:50.090 --> 23:52.930]  Were you pulling seeds off occasionally and squeezing them?
[23:52.930 --> 23:55.190]  Here's a way we can correct this in the future.
[23:55.190 --> 23:59.730]  The next time you're making seeds, start pulling them out of the plant and checking on them
[23:59.730 --> 24:02.310]  a little bit earlier than you did this time.
[24:02.310 --> 24:05.690]  When I know that seeds are getting close or not even close, when I'm getting antsy and
[24:05.690 --> 24:09.650]  anxious and nervous and want more beans, I'll go to the plant and I'll just pick a
[24:09.650 --> 24:12.410]  nug somewhere on the plant and I'll just reach in and pull a seed right out.
[24:12.410 --> 24:13.410]  You can see them.
[24:13.410 --> 24:14.410]  You can feel them.
[24:14.410 --> 24:15.410]  If you can't, there are no seeds.
[24:15.410 --> 24:17.170]  Yours were obviously hard enough.
[24:17.170 --> 24:18.330]  Start pulling a few out.
[24:18.330 --> 24:19.330]  Rub the shell off.
[24:19.330 --> 24:20.330]  Put it in your hand.
[24:20.330 --> 24:21.330]  Squeeze it.
[24:21.330 --> 24:22.330]  Does it explode?
[24:22.330 --> 24:23.330]  Does it pop?
[24:23.330 --> 24:24.330]  Does it crunch?
[24:24.330 --> 24:25.330]  Does it crack?
[24:25.330 --> 24:26.330]  Or does it leave a dent in your fingers?
[24:26.330 --> 24:28.470]  If they start leaving dents in your fingers, they're close to done.
[24:28.470 --> 24:29.470]  Are they tiger striped?
[24:29.470 --> 24:30.470]  Are they the color you want?
[24:30.470 --> 24:31.730]  Are they solid?
[24:31.730 --> 24:36.530]  If you start paying attention to that, then you can prevent leaving them for too long.
[24:36.530 --> 24:37.810]  Sometimes you could take the tops.
[24:37.810 --> 24:38.810]  Those seeds will be ready.
[24:38.810 --> 24:39.810]  Let the bottoms keep going.
[24:39.810 --> 24:43.170]  That way you only let some go too long, maybe some too early.
[24:43.170 --> 24:47.250]  Outdoors, it's kind of hard to judge, but indoors, you should have pollinated all at
[24:47.250 --> 24:48.250]  once.
[24:48.250 --> 24:49.250]  All that pollen should hit at one time.
[24:49.250 --> 24:50.810]  Most of the seeds should be consistent.
[24:50.810 --> 24:55.450]  You should be able to tell by plucking seeds from two or three spots, examining.
[24:55.450 --> 24:59.250]  Do that once or twice, three or four times, and you'll know how far along those seeds
[24:59.250 --> 25:00.250]  are.
[25:00.770 --> 25:07.010]  Once again, bottom line, my prognosis, my diagnosis, my hypothesis, my thesis, my fucking
[25:07.010 --> 25:12.250]  stoner idea, my bro science does say that these seeds simply grew for too long and they
[25:12.250 --> 25:14.970]  got too hard, too thick, too robust.
[25:14.970 --> 25:15.970]  I would try to crack them.
[25:15.970 --> 25:21.290]  I would work more on the scarification, maybe a longer germ soak, maybe soak them for 24
[25:21.290 --> 25:22.290]  hours.
[25:22.290 --> 25:23.450]  Crack them or soak them.
[25:23.450 --> 25:24.450]  No, wait.
[25:24.450 --> 25:25.450]  Try that again.
[25:25.450 --> 25:28.970]  Crack them or scar them, then soak them for 24, then try to germ them.
[25:28.970 --> 25:32.250]  It may help you out, but it sounds like you've tried a lot of good methods.
[25:32.250 --> 25:33.810]  You're doing the right shit.
[25:33.810 --> 25:34.970]  They're just too hard.
[25:34.970 --> 25:35.970]  You got the Hulk.
[25:35.970 --> 25:36.970]  You got the rock.
[25:36.970 --> 25:39.690]  They're made out of, what'd you say, vibranium, unobtainium?
[25:39.690 --> 25:42.810]  Yeah, they're made out of fucking steel because they went for too long.
[25:42.810 --> 25:43.810]  All right.
[25:43.810 --> 25:44.810]  I hope that was good advice.
[25:44.810 --> 25:49.410]  Unfortunately, I don't have a real solution other than check next time a little bit better.
[25:49.410 --> 25:50.410]  That would be my advice.
[25:50.410 --> 25:51.410]  Pay more attention.
[25:51.410 --> 25:54.130]  I'm not saying you didn't pay attention, but pay more attention next time.
[25:54.130 --> 25:56.290]  Now you know what to look for, how to correct it.
[25:56.290 --> 25:57.290]  All right.
[25:57.290 --> 26:01.330]  Andrew, thank you for the great compliments, and thank you for the great message.
[26:01.330 --> 26:05.410]  I hope you get some keepers out of there, and I hope you find a winner out of those
[26:05.410 --> 26:06.410]  beans.
[26:06.410 --> 26:07.410]  All right.
[26:07.410 --> 26:11.050]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[26:11.050 --> 26:15.130]  cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you wonderful cannabis enthusiasts out there, I really do
[26:15.130 --> 26:18.650]  want to thank you once again for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[26:18.650 --> 26:19.890]  podcast.
[26:19.890 --> 26:23.010]  This was 718 episodes.
[26:23.010 --> 26:26.570]  Blows my mind that you guys want to listen to that much of my nonsense.
[26:27.330 --> 26:28.330]  Thank you.
[26:28.330 --> 26:29.330]  I appreciate it.
[26:29.330 --> 26:30.330]  Keep the support coming.
[26:30.330 --> 26:32.090]  Please do send more Grow questions.
[26:32.090 --> 26:34.050]  I like answering Grow questions.
[26:34.050 --> 26:35.330]  It does a lot of things.
[26:35.330 --> 26:37.770]  It lets me know that I am helping you.
[26:37.770 --> 26:41.810]  If somebody has that question, there are thousands of listeners to this show.
[26:41.810 --> 26:46.210]  If one person's got the question, the numbers tell me there are probably multiple people
[26:46.210 --> 26:47.410]  that have that question.
[26:47.410 --> 26:51.930]  There are only so many opportunities and things to do in cannabis growth, so if a question
[26:51.930 --> 26:56.110]  arises, a lot of people are probably thinking it, one person said it, so it lets me know
[26:56.150 --> 26:57.150]  that I'm helping you.
[26:57.150 --> 27:00.990]  It gives me an objective, a mission, a purpose, how to help you.
[27:00.990 --> 27:04.310]  Also, it helps me not have to just come up with a show off the top of my head, so that
[27:04.310 --> 27:05.310]  helps a lot.
[27:05.310 --> 27:06.390]  Send in those questions.
[27:06.390 --> 27:11.390]  Send the details, the comments, the cultivation questions, the community questions, all that
[27:11.390 --> 27:12.390]  stuff.
[27:12.390 --> 27:13.390]  I do look forward to it.
[27:13.390 --> 27:19.270]  Also, check out the website, iregenetics.com, also patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[27:19.270 --> 27:21.110]  You guys already know about that.
[27:21.110 --> 27:22.110]  My throat's burning out.
[27:22.110 --> 27:23.110]  I've covered all the content.
[27:23.110 --> 27:24.550]  It's time to wrap up the show.
[27:24.630 --> 27:27.190]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[27:27.190 --> 27:31.430]  Let's give a big shout out to my buddy and the captain and commander of the Irie Army,
[27:31.430 --> 27:35.990]  my good friend Lemur Priest, and until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug
[27:35.990 --> 27:37.990]  for me.
