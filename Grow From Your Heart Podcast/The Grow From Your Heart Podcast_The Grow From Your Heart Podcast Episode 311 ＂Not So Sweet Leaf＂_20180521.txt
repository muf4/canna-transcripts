[01:56.680 --> 02:01.720]  letting you know what I'm smoking on. Today, I've been dabbing on some Stardog Ambrosia from
[02:01.720 --> 02:06.920]  Apothecary Farms. I've been in love with the Stardog lately. I love the way it smells. I love
[02:06.920 --> 02:11.880]  the way it smokes. I love the high it gives me. I love growing Stardog. I like taking pictures of it.
[02:11.880 --> 02:18.520]  Stardog has just been a great plant for me lately. I'm giving it a smell right now. It's got that
[02:18.520 --> 02:22.360]  fuely, earthy thing that I've been into lately. Then it's got something else on top of it,
[02:22.360 --> 02:28.840]  something just dirty and funky. I really love it. Fuely, dirty, feet, funk, right up my alley.
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.160]  Just the exact thing I've been in love with lately. I've been so in love with the Stardog lately that
[02:33.160 --> 02:37.800]  I crossed it to Arise. I came up with the name. I've been trying to struggle for a name for it.
[02:37.800 --> 02:41.800]  I was in an Instagram live feed the other day. One of our friends who I'm not sure if he wants
[02:41.800 --> 02:47.160]  his name set on a podcast, but he shouted out or he typed out, I guess, he typed out Starstruck.
[02:47.960 --> 02:52.600]  I'm going with it. Starstruck is awesome. Stardog to Arise, that is called Starstruck.
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.440]  Coming soon to a seed bank near you, Starstruck. All right. We got Starstruck named. We got
[02:58.440 --> 03:03.640]  blueberry cookies crosses available. I am smoking Stardog Ambrosia. I think we've covered all the
[03:03.640 --> 03:07.800]  business for the start of the podcast. Let's get into the main topic. If you pay attention
[03:07.800 --> 03:13.400]  to the podcast, you have probably heard me talk about a dispensary known as Sweetleaf.
[03:13.400 --> 03:17.320]  Sweetleaf is a chain of dispensaries in Colorado that got in trouble for doing something
[03:17.320 --> 03:22.600]  known as looping. Now, before we get too far, I'll tell you what looping is. In the state of
[03:22.600 --> 03:26.680]  Colorado, when you buy recreational cannabis, you were allowed to buy one ounce at a time per
[03:26.680 --> 03:32.520]  transaction. Now, a lot of people found that word per transaction as a loophole. They would buy an
[03:32.520 --> 03:38.280]  ounce of cannabis. They would then drive around the block or maybe just go get lunch or something
[03:38.280 --> 03:42.360]  and then come right back to the same dispensary and buy another ounce of cannabis, which means
[03:42.360 --> 03:49.320]  they have now purchased two ounces of cannabis from the same dispensary in one day. Now, at some
[03:49.320 --> 03:56.440]  point, the marijuana enforcement division sent out a memo saying, no more looping. The rule is that
[03:56.440 --> 04:03.720]  you are allowed to sell one ounce of cannabis per person per day from your facility. So at that time,
[04:03.720 --> 04:10.360]  it was expected that looping would stop. It appears allegedly that Sweetleaf continued with
[04:10.360 --> 04:16.520]  the looping. And that puts us kind of in the article that I've got before me. This article
[04:16.520 --> 04:20.600]  comes from The Cannabis and it was written by Alicia Wallace and it was originally published
[04:20.600 --> 04:28.840]  on April 30th and it was updated yesterday. And it goes like this. The Sweetleaf dispensary chain
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.320]  shut down in December after a police sting was a criminal enterprise that pocketed millions from an
[04:33.320 --> 04:38.280]  illicit looping scheme that allowed customers to purchase the maximum amount of marijuana multiple
[04:38.280 --> 04:44.280]  times in a day, a municipal hearing officer has ruled. As a result, Sweetleaf Marijuana Centers
[04:44.280 --> 04:49.320]  could be stripped of its 26 retail, cultivation and manufacturing licenses, according to
[04:49.320 --> 04:55.640]  recommendations released Monday by Denver hearing officer, Suzanne Faising. Sweetleaf scheme at the
[04:55.640 --> 05:00.680]  very least permitted the unlawful possession by its customers and its scheme was not the action of
[05:00.680 --> 05:05.800]  a reasonable licensee, she wrote. Not only did Sweetleaf fail to take action to stop the illegal
[05:05.800 --> 05:10.760]  purchases, but it actively aided and abetted the illegal purchases through its looping scheme.
[05:11.480 --> 05:16.520]  Ashley Kilroy, the city's director of marijuana policy will have the final say on Sweetleaf's fate
[05:16.520 --> 05:20.520]  following a 10-day period for objections and a five-day period for a response.
[05:21.080 --> 05:26.760]  Kilroy's determination could come in the next few weeks. Officials for the city of Denver said
[05:26.760 --> 05:31.240]  Sweetleaf could not be immediately reached for comment. Sweetleaf's licenses were suspended on
[05:31.240 --> 05:36.760]  December 14th when police raided eight Sweetleaf facilities in Denver and Aurora following a year-long
[05:36.760 --> 05:41.880]  undercover investigation into illegal marijuana sales. More than a dozen arrests of budtenders
[05:41.880 --> 05:47.720]  and customers have been made in connection with the case. The investigation zeroed in on alleged
[05:47.720 --> 05:52.200]  incidents of looping in which Sweetleaf budtenders would make repeated sales of up to one ounce
[05:52.200 --> 05:56.840]  of recreational marijuana, the maximum allowed for individual possession under Colorado law,
[05:56.840 --> 06:03.720]  to the same customer multiple times in one day. Looping accounted for at least $6.7 million
[06:03.720 --> 06:08.120]  of medical marijuana sales in the 18-month period that ended when the stores were shut down and at
[06:08.120 --> 06:13.880]  least $1.5 million in recreational marijuana sales, according to the hearing officer's report.
[06:13.880 --> 06:19.320]  At least half of the loopers had out-of-state IDs, Faising wrote. She found that people from Arkansas,
[06:19.320 --> 06:25.560]  Nebraska, New Mexico, and Texas purchased large amounts of marijuana to resale illegally in their
[06:25.560 --> 06:30.680]  home states. Some of those customers were convicted of criminal charges after being arrested with
[06:30.680 --> 06:35.240]  multiple pounds of Sweetleaf marijuana in their possession. Now I'm sure a lot of people are going
[06:35.240 --> 06:39.960]  to go, how can they prove that that was Sweetleaf marijuana? Well, because when you buy something
[06:39.960 --> 06:45.320]  from a dispensary, it comes very nicely packaged, but then they put a sticker on it with their logo
[06:45.320 --> 06:50.920]  right on it. I'm looking at a couple of containers. I've got Apothecary Farms logos all over my table.
[06:50.920 --> 06:55.880]  I've got a Three Rivers logo right here. I've got a whole bunch, I've got a Cut Above logos right here.
[06:55.880 --> 06:59.720]  They could tell where all of my products came from. And if you couldn't tell by the logo on it,
[06:59.720 --> 07:03.560]  there's a number on it. Every one of these packages, let's see if I can find it on here.
[07:03.560 --> 07:08.840]  There it is right there. It's actually got the dispensary, the address, the city, the zip code,
[07:09.400 --> 07:15.560]  the phone number, followed by the MMC number, the Medical Marijuana Center, the 402-number.
[07:15.560 --> 07:21.720]  That number right there indicates exactly where that came from. So that's how they know where it
[07:21.720 --> 07:25.480]  came from. They know what day that was grown. They know what day that was purchased. If any of those
[07:25.480 --> 07:29.800]  stickers are on there, all of the details are right there. And a lot of people out of state,
[07:29.800 --> 07:34.040]  they want that labeling on there because it makes the product worth more. That came from Colorado.
[07:34.040 --> 07:38.600]  It's got labels on it. That's a quality product. The price goes up. So people are fucking up.
[07:38.600 --> 07:42.680]  They're taking those labels with them. That's how they know that it was Sweetleaf product.
[07:42.680 --> 07:45.320]  Alright, let's move on with the article. Where was I?
[08:12.680 --> 08:20.360]  Sweetleaf's attorneys argued that Colorado marijuana rules in place prior to January 1st
[08:20.360 --> 08:25.160]  did not explicitly prohibit the sale of more than one ounce of recreational marijuana per day,
[08:25.800 --> 08:30.280]  but rather it barred any single sale of more than one ounce of recreational pot.
[08:31.080 --> 08:35.640]  Multiple transaction to the same person would not have been in violation of state law, they said.
[08:42.840 --> 08:55.480]  Sweetleaf's owners, Matthew Aiken, Christian Johnson, and Anthony Suaro,
[08:55.480 --> 09:00.200]  encouraged and directed the practice of looping, including training new employees to allow looping
[09:00.200 --> 09:04.200]  for retail customers if the customer left the premise after each purchase, she wrote.
[09:04.920 --> 09:10.120]  Evidence cited by Phasing included messages from management on Sweetleaf's Slack channel
[09:10.200 --> 09:12.440]  promoting multiple sales to the same customer.
[09:13.080 --> 09:16.760]  Looping is going to be going on until the new year, most likely, they wrote.
[09:16.760 --> 09:21.160]  Please talk it up with extended plant count patients. We need med sales up.
[09:21.160 --> 09:25.000]  The evidence is clear in this case that respondents implemented a looping scheme
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.480]  that was intended to evade quantity limitations on the sale of retail marijuana, she said.
[09:32.520 --> 09:37.400]  So it looks like there is a huge chance that Sweetleaf will lose all of these licenses,
[09:37.400 --> 09:41.960]  and if that happens, there will be a lot of hot licenses up for sale. We're going to see some
[09:41.960 --> 09:47.720]  changes in the game when that comes. But it looks like a lady by the name of Ashley Kilroy has the
[09:47.720 --> 09:54.040]  final say on what's going on. Looks like they get a 10 day period for objections, and then a five
[09:54.040 --> 10:00.120]  day period for a response. And it looks like they say the determination could come in the next few
[10:00.120 --> 10:03.800]  weeks. You guys, I will do my best to keep everybody updated. And I want to give Mike
[10:03.800 --> 10:08.040]  a huge shout out for sharing this article with me. Hey, dude, thanks for the great text message.
[10:08.040 --> 10:12.520]  It made a great podcast episode. Ladies and gentlemen, it just started. If you live in
[10:12.520 --> 10:17.000]  Colorado, if you live in southern Colorado, you know about the Miller moth season every year.
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.160]  In southern Colorado, we get invaded by these little moths that fly around all of your lights,
[10:21.160 --> 10:25.960]  they come out of nowhere. The first one just arrived in my house, it just flew around the light.
[10:26.520 --> 10:31.160]  It has begun. They're really not that bad. They're just annoying. They fly around all the lights all
[10:31.160 --> 10:34.920]  the time. And when they bump into the lights, all that moth dust, that butterfly dust comes off
[10:34.920 --> 10:39.320]  their wings. So you got to just keep shit covered up. And honestly, I start turning off more lights.
[10:39.320 --> 10:43.640]  So it helps me remember to turn off all the damn lights. I got to cover up all the hash on the
[10:43.640 --> 10:47.800]  table. I can't have any concentrates open because I don't want that moth dust in my concentrates. I
[10:47.800 --> 10:51.880]  think that's disgusting. The worst part is when they get in the damn grow room because they just
[10:51.880 --> 10:56.680]  want to fly around your light. And all on the light they smack the if you got glass over the
[10:56.680 --> 11:00.760]  light, like I've got vented lights, they bounce all over that. And if you don't have glass over
[11:00.760 --> 11:05.560]  the lights, they fly into the fucking bulb and cook themselves and it smells so bad. So yeah,
[11:05.560 --> 11:10.600]  they're annoying more than anything. But they have arrived. It is Miller season. Alright, guys,
[11:10.600 --> 11:13.640]  I want to give a few shout outs before I start wrapping up this episode. I want to give a huge
[11:13.640 --> 11:18.200]  shout out to my friend the Canna crap. What's up, bro? Also a huge shout out to Will Parsons and an
