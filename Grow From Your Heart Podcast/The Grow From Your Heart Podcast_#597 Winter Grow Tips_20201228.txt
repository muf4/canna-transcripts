[01:39.040 --> 01:44.520]  too far, I want to send a big special thank you to everybody who supported Mrs. Bog on
[01:44.520 --> 01:49.040]  the GoFundMe. In the last episode, I mentioned that we did lose a cannabis soldier. Rest
[01:49.040 --> 01:54.520]  in peace, Bog. I did ask for support for Mrs. Bog through the GoFundMe page. Big thank
[01:54.520 --> 01:59.480]  you to everybody who contributed to that GoFundMe page. I got a lot of response to that. Got
[01:59.480 --> 02:03.680]  a lot of great messages. Got a lot of encouragement. Most importantly, we got Mrs. Bog a lot of
[02:03.680 --> 02:08.840]  help and a lot of funding. So thank you. That does mean a lot to see the outpouring of support
[02:08.840 --> 02:14.640]  from the cannabis community. Thank you. I appreciate it. And Mrs. Bog truly does appreciate
[02:14.640 --> 02:18.820]  the support. All right, where do we go from there? Let's jump right into the main topic
[02:18.820 --> 02:24.740]  of this episode. It is a nice, cold Colorado evening. I think the monitor said it was 17
[02:24.740 --> 02:29.700]  degrees outside when I looked at the security cameras. That is frosty cold. I want to do
[02:29.700 --> 02:34.600]  update a thing I said on a previous episode. In a previous episode, I mentioned getting
[02:34.600 --> 02:38.340]  your plants up off of the grow room floor. That grow room floor is super cold in the
[02:38.340 --> 02:41.900]  winter. It could be super cold in the winter. I'm not sure where you are or what you're
[02:41.900 --> 02:46.580]  doing. My grow room floor is really cold in the wintertime. So it's always a good idea
[02:46.740 --> 02:51.180]  to get my plants up off of the floor. A lot of people will use a pallet. A lot of people
[02:51.180 --> 02:55.300]  use a cinder block. Some people use another pot flipped upside down. As long as we are
[02:55.300 --> 02:59.140]  getting those pots up off the ground so the root zone isn't super cold, we are giving
[02:59.140 --> 03:03.380]  our plants a little bit of help or setting ourselves up for success. Think about that
[03:03.380 --> 03:07.900]  cold pot sitting on the floor. It's nice and cold. Then we pour water into it. That water
[03:07.900 --> 03:11.580]  makes it even colder. The plant can't go anywhere. It's going to get pissed off. So let's get
[03:11.580 --> 03:16.200]  those plants up off the floor and keep them nice and warm. Something that I was inspired
[03:16.200 --> 03:22.600]  by that episode was to tell you to put your EZ-Cloner or your Turbo-Cloner on that cold
[03:22.600 --> 03:26.800]  floor. Just to give you an idea of what I'm talking about if you're not following along.
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.560]  A lot of us use a Turbo-Cloner or an EZ-Cloner or a Power-Cloner to make our clones. It is
[03:31.560 --> 03:36.320]  a clone machine. You fill a reservoir with water. You put a pump inside of that reservoir.
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.560]  That reservoir has a manifold with multiple sprayers that spray water at an upward angle
[03:40.560 --> 03:44.800]  toward the bottom of our plants. It's got a lid on it. You fill the lid with clones.
[03:44.800 --> 03:48.840]  The bottoms of the clones hang down into that spraying area. They get misted with that
[03:48.840 --> 03:54.400]  water and they make roots. The pump inside of that cloner will heat up the water quite
[03:54.400 --> 03:59.600]  rapidly. In a normal environment, I would run that pump for about 50 minutes and then
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.520]  turn it off for 10 minutes. So every hour it gets a 10 minute rest cycle to let the
[04:03.520 --> 04:08.120]  heat of that water cool down. The water is getting heated by the pump. The water is naturally
[04:08.120 --> 04:12.760]  warm because it's in that warm grow area. So it's going to heat up quite quickly inside
[04:12.760 --> 04:17.200]  that little reservoir. A way we can avoid that in the winter is to simply take that
[04:17.200 --> 04:21.920]  clone machine and put it on our cold grow room floor. That will keep that water nice
[04:21.920 --> 04:25.320]  and cool. That will mitigate some of the heat created by that pump and that will keep your
[04:25.320 --> 04:30.720]  clones nice and happy. Hopefully, this will also prevent in a little bit of the evaporation
[04:30.720 --> 04:34.760]  of the water. You won't have to adjust your pH and your EC as frequently. So that will
[04:34.760 --> 04:39.420]  help you out. Make sure to check the EC and the pH of your cloner on a daily basis. Make
[04:39.420 --> 04:43.800]  sure you add clear res every five days. But if the water is a little cooler, it won't
[04:43.800 --> 04:49.060]  evaporate as much. So we won't need to make as many critical adjustments. Something to
[04:49.060 --> 04:54.480]  pay attention to is don't let it get too cold. I think 69 degrees and above is good for our
[04:54.480 --> 04:59.540]  water in our turbo cloner and for our plants in general. You may want to go a little higher.
[04:59.540 --> 05:04.100]  You may want to go a little cooler, but my rule of thumb is 69 degrees is as cool as
[05:04.100 --> 05:08.340]  I want to go. I don't want to go much cooler than that. That will start slowing down the
[05:08.340 --> 05:12.880]  root development and the health of your plants. So the first tip for the winter is if you
[05:12.880 --> 05:17.560]  are using an easy cloner or a clone machine and the water is heating up too rapidly, take
[05:17.560 --> 05:22.420]  that clone machine and set it right on the cold grow room floor. That cold is free. It's
[05:22.420 --> 05:26.220]  right there waiting for you and it is there to solve a problem. So this episode is going
[05:26.220 --> 05:31.200]  to be about using the things in our grow room that we've already got to create the best
[05:31.200 --> 05:35.360]  environment and best conditions we can with what we've got. We've spent a lot of money
[05:35.360 --> 05:39.940]  on equipment. We've spent a lot of time planning this out. Let's try to learn to adapt to each
[05:39.940 --> 05:45.400]  season and use the gear wisely to get the best outcomes in our grow room. Another big
[05:45.400 --> 05:50.160]  tip I've got for you. The water coming out of the faucet in the winter is going to be
[05:50.160 --> 05:53.620]  cold. The pipes are outside underground. It's cold as fuck out there. That water is going
[05:53.620 --> 05:57.760]  to come out of the faucet really cold. It's going to be in the 40s and 50s, maybe in the
[05:57.760 --> 06:02.600]  60s, depending on how cold it is in your environment. Everything I'm saying is Fahrenheit, by the
[06:02.600 --> 06:06.520]  way. I am in America. We go by Fahrenheit. If you're in Canada or somewhere else, you
[06:06.520 --> 06:10.560]  can adjust. You got to do the math. I do apologize. I'm speaking in Fahrenheit terms today. Let
[06:10.560 --> 06:14.200]  me make that clear. So the water coming out of the faucet in the winter is going to be
[06:14.200 --> 06:18.560]  60 degrees. I've said before, we don't want to feed the plants anything that's 69 degrees
[06:18.560 --> 06:24.120]  or cooler. So why not fill your reservoir up today before you've got to water in the
[06:24.120 --> 06:28.040]  morning, drag the reservoir into the grow room, put it underneath the grow lights. It
[06:28.040 --> 06:30.720]  doesn't have to go right under the lights where the plants are. If you've got some extra
[06:30.720 --> 06:35.080]  space in your grow environment for your reservoir, roll that reservoir right into the grow room
[06:35.080 --> 06:39.200]  and let it get heated up by the grow room overnight. That way, when we go in there to
[06:39.200 --> 06:43.960]  water, you've got water that is the same temperature as the room in which the plants are in. That
[06:43.960 --> 06:47.560]  way, we're not giving them any shock, not giving them any problems, not dipping their
[06:47.560 --> 06:52.680]  feet in that cold water. Be nice to your plants. You expect a positive outcome from them. Let's
[06:52.680 --> 06:58.040]  not torture them by pouring icy cold water over their feet. All right. So fill up that
[06:58.040 --> 07:02.120]  reservoir the night before, the day before if possible, and let it get warmed up. If
[07:02.120 --> 07:06.520]  you can't get it warm enough by the time you need to use it, I recommend an aquarium heater.
[07:06.520 --> 07:10.240]  You can get those glass aquarium heaters, drop it right in the water, plug it in, set
[07:10.240 --> 07:15.080]  yourself a timer. Put your most of the good, the Blue Lab EC and pH meters have a thermometer
[07:15.080 --> 07:18.560]  on there. Just drop that in there. Let it float around. When you're walking around the
[07:18.560 --> 07:22.080]  grow doing your chores, just check on it. Give it a little stir. See what the pH of
[07:22.080 --> 07:26.320]  that or the temperature of that water is. Then when it's heated up appropriately, unplug
[07:26.320 --> 07:30.080]  the heater, clean the heater off. They gather a lot of sediment, clean them off, put it
[07:30.080 --> 07:34.840]  away, save it for next time. Always adjust the pH after the water is at room temperature
[07:34.840 --> 07:39.200]  right before you feed it to the plants. If it's cold, the water will get warm and the
[07:39.200 --> 07:44.200]  pH will change. If it's hot, it will cool down and the pH will change. Adjust the pH
[07:44.200 --> 07:48.080]  when it is at the temperature at which you are going to feed it to the plants. It will
[07:48.080 --> 07:52.120]  be that pH when it goes into your plants at that time. Don't adjust it when it's cold
[07:52.120 --> 07:55.880]  because it will fluctuate. Don't adjust it when it's hot because it will fluctuate when
[07:55.880 --> 08:00.800]  it adjusts to room temperature. So adjust your pH at room temperature, then feed it
[08:00.800 --> 08:01.800]  to your plants.
[08:01.800 --> 08:06.560]  Now here are a couple of other useful tips and tricks to do with ducting and venting
[08:06.560 --> 08:11.360]  in the grow room. It is nice and cold. Perhaps you've got two grow spaces. Perhaps you've
[08:11.360 --> 08:15.680]  got a flowering space that runs for 12 hours on and 12 hours off. Then you've probably
[08:15.680 --> 08:21.320]  got a veg space that runs for 16 on, 8 off or 18 on and 6 off. Maybe 24 on if you're
[08:21.320 --> 08:25.860]  one of those people. I do a 19 and 5 because that makes my mother plants grow and I'm sure
[08:25.860 --> 08:29.780]  that the big mother plants won't try to auto flower on me if they're getting root bound
[08:29.780 --> 08:34.980]  or something and it does give them 4 hours to sleep. I recommend at least a 4 hour sleep
[08:34.980 --> 08:39.240]  period or it gives them 5 hours. My math was terrible there. I recommend some sleep period
[08:39.240 --> 08:43.500]  for your plants. It lets your plants sleep. It lets the root zone and the microbes happen
[08:43.500 --> 08:47.220]  in the dark zone. All that activity happens in the night time. So let them sleep. Get
[08:47.220 --> 08:51.220]  some night time. Also, it gives your equipment some rest. All those lights have been running
[08:51.220 --> 08:55.600]  all day. All of your fans, your blowers, everything has been running. If you can turn a few things
[08:55.600 --> 09:00.840]  off for a 4 hour period, you're saving electricity, you're saving time on your equipment which
[09:00.840 --> 09:05.120]  will give you longevity out of that equipment. Like I said, everything wants a nap. If I
[09:05.120 --> 09:10.000]  ran you for 24 hours a day and never gave you any dark time, you may show some kind
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.780]  of signs of psycho eventually. Some psychosis, some craziness will come out of you. So everything
[09:14.780 --> 09:19.520]  wants a nap. Give those plants a little nap. Give your gear a nap. Utilize the nap time
[09:19.520 --> 09:23.280]  of your gear. What I'm getting at is when the flower room goes off in the winter time,
[09:23.280 --> 09:28.560]  it may get a bit cold in there. When those lights shut off, the temperatures will drop.
[09:28.560 --> 09:33.680]  Something I do is I duct the heat from my bedroom into the flower room at night time
[09:33.680 --> 09:37.840]  so I can keep that flower room a little bit warmer than it would be without heat. That
[09:37.840 --> 09:41.180]  way I don't have to buy a heater to put in there. I'm using the heat that's already being
[09:41.180 --> 09:45.080]  created in one room by the lights that are constantly on and I'm just dumping that heat
[09:45.080 --> 09:50.340]  right into another room. So learn to utilize the heat that you don't want in one area.
[09:50.340 --> 09:53.940]  Put it in another area. That way you can keep one room cool. One room will be at the
[09:53.940 --> 09:59.040]  right temperature and you don't have to buy a heater to keep that flowering room cool.
[09:59.040 --> 10:03.380]  Something else I do. Sometimes if it's the right temperature, if it works out just right,
[10:03.380 --> 10:08.620]  I will duct the heat from the flowering room into a portion of my home and spread that
[10:08.620 --> 10:12.180]  out throughout the house to keep the entire house warm. If you've got a smaller house,
[10:12.180 --> 10:16.540]  this will work beautifully. A couple or a few thousand watt lights will heat up a room
[10:16.540 --> 10:20.200]  quite quickly. If you've got a 10 by 10 room with 4,000 watt lights, you're cranking out
[10:20.200 --> 10:24.280]  a bunch of heat. Instead of ducting that stuff right outside of the house, duct that
[10:24.280 --> 10:28.080]  into your bedroom, duct that into your living room, duct it into the basement and let it
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.560]  rise into the rest of the house. Heat rises. Think about moving that warm air around. You
[10:32.560 --> 10:36.760]  can save yourself on HVAC costs. Heating, ventilation, air conditioning costs can go
[10:36.760 --> 10:41.760]  down if you learn how to duct the air that you're already creating. Duct that warm air
[10:41.760 --> 10:46.280]  to a useful spot of the house, to the grow, wherever you need it. Learn to move that air
[10:46.280 --> 10:49.960]  around and utilize it. That way we don't have to spend more money on heat. There's already
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.640]  heat. Let's use it. Let's get warm with it. You can duct that heat straight from either
[10:54.640 --> 10:59.320]  your flower room or your bedroom right into your house, right into your bedroom. If you've
[10:59.320 --> 11:03.160]  got a bedroom that gets kind of cold at night, if your basement doesn't get warm enough,
[11:03.160 --> 11:06.800]  if part of the house doesn't get warm enough, run that ducting right to there and just duct
[11:06.800 --> 11:11.440]  that heat into the coldest part of the house. Warm yourself up. It's kind of like recycling.
[11:11.440 --> 11:15.040]  You're saving money and it's grow room heat that needs to go somewhere anyway. Send it
[11:15.160 --> 11:20.560]  somewhere useful. What else can we do? There is humidity to be dealt with. A lot of times
[11:20.560 --> 11:24.880]  the flower room will make a lot of humidity. You got big flowering plants in there. You
[11:24.880 --> 11:28.720]  got a bunch of humidity going on. You just fed. If you've got four lights in there, you
[11:28.720 --> 11:33.120]  got four, seven gallon pots per light. That's going to be a lot of humidity when you water
[11:33.120 --> 11:36.240]  those plants. Maybe you got more in there. Maybe you got less. We're going to create
[11:36.240 --> 11:41.560]  humidity. My point is let's learn to duct that humidity from the flowering room into
[11:41.640 --> 11:45.560]  the vegetative room. The veg room loves high humidity. You're not going to run into nearly
[11:45.560 --> 11:49.800]  as many problems with a veg room with high humidity as you would a flowering room with
[11:49.800 --> 11:54.920]  high humidity. Let's put a blower at the top of the room or a duct at the top of the room
[11:54.920 --> 11:58.400]  that'll suck all that humidity because the humidity is at the top. Let's suck that heat
[11:58.400 --> 12:02.640]  and humidity out of that room and move it right into the veg space. All you need is
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.200]  a four inch blower and some ducting. If you want to use a humidistat that will tell you
[12:07.240 --> 12:11.960]  how much humidity is in the room, you can set a humidistat to say when it gets to 70
[12:11.960 --> 12:16.000]  or 80% humidity, I'm just guessing random numbers, it's got a dial on it. When you get
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.880]  it to that, when it hits that setting, it'll kick on and it will move your humidity. When
[12:19.880 --> 12:23.400]  it gets past that threshold, it'll turn it right off. It's a switch that plugs into the
[12:23.400 --> 12:28.160]  wall. You turn a dial, you set it to the amount you want, then you plug your blower into there.
[12:28.160 --> 12:31.800]  There's a sensor that hangs in the middle of the room and it says, Oh, 80% humidity.
[12:31.800 --> 12:36.200]  I better turn on this blower and it'll blow that duct. It'll blow that air right through
[12:36.200 --> 12:39.980]  the duct, right into your bedroom. And now your bedroom gets a little extra humidity
[12:39.980 --> 12:44.680]  and you don't cause problems in the flowering area. It's all about utilizing what is already
[12:44.680 --> 12:49.000]  there with minimal equipment. This will save you problems. This will save you money. You
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.440]  probably bought a bunch of excess gear that you didn't need anyway, because people get
[12:52.440 --> 12:58.840]  excited when they build their grows. Let's learn to use that to our advantage. Also,
[12:58.840 --> 13:02.960]  a lot of people, this is kind of old school tech, but a lot of people are still doing
[13:02.960 --> 13:07.000]  the old school tech. A lot of people have ducted lights, vented lights. So you've got
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.320]  a light. I'm going to try to explain this the best I can. You've got a light fixture
[13:10.320 --> 13:15.380]  that hangs from the ceiling. It is a square fixture. The bottom part has glass under it.
[13:15.380 --> 13:18.960]  So there's a bulb inside of there, but instead of sealing that bottom, we put glass in there
[13:18.960 --> 13:23.000]  so the light can shine through the glass and illuminate the grow room. They put a hole
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.720]  on one side of the box and a hole on the other side of the box, and we can run ducting across
[13:27.720 --> 13:31.440]  that. That way we can move the heat away from the light. It doesn't enter our grow space
[13:31.440 --> 13:35.960]  and we can duct that light, that heat wherever we need it. A lot of times you'll put several
[13:35.960 --> 13:41.880]  of those lights in a chain. You put a blower at one end, a carbon filter, a blower, ducting,
[13:41.880 --> 13:46.100]  and then your light chain, however many lights you're going to put. And then you do ducting
[13:46.100 --> 13:49.320]  right outside of your grow facility, right out of the room, right out of the window,
[13:49.320 --> 13:53.940]  however you're going to do it, duct that air outside. So then the air goes over your lights
[13:53.940 --> 13:57.680]  and outside. That way you're cooling off the lights. None of that light heat is heating
[13:57.720 --> 14:03.160]  up your grow space, right? Why not turn that blower around and suck that cool air over
[14:03.160 --> 14:07.280]  your lights to cool the lights even more? At that point, I would duct the, I would do
[14:07.280 --> 14:11.520]  a complete loop. I would have air coming in from outside, going over my lights. Then it
[14:11.520 --> 14:15.040]  would do a U-turn at one end of the room and go right back across the room, go through
[14:15.040 --> 14:20.000]  all the other ducting over every light. Then it would go out. It would go right against
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.220]  the wall and that duct would go right out of a hole. I use the blue foam insulation
[14:24.220 --> 14:28.480]  to cover windows and you can drill six inch holes through that foam insulation very easily
[14:28.480 --> 14:32.180]  and run your ducting right through that. So I would create a continuous loop. That way
[14:32.180 --> 14:37.780]  none of that heat from your lights makes it to your grow and you can cool those lights
[14:37.780 --> 14:42.900]  rapidly by pulling that 17 degree air over those light bulbs. That'll cool it very, very
[14:42.900 --> 14:47.580]  quickly. Don't introduce that 17 degree air into your grow room right away. Then you'll
[14:47.580 --> 14:52.100]  start getting frost and icicles and that will encourage you to get powdery mildew. But if
[14:52.100 --> 14:55.940]  you can reverse the duct and keep that loop and get the air over the lights and right
[14:55.940 --> 15:00.640]  back out, that will rapidly cool those grow lights. A lot of times it's going to get too
[15:00.640 --> 15:05.940]  cold in your grow room. What's to stop you from hanging more lights? Most of the time
[15:05.940 --> 15:09.680]  the thing stopping us from putting up more lights is heat. It's winter time. Let's put
[15:09.680 --> 15:13.700]  up more lights. Don't buy a heater. Don't put a heater in there. That is a waste. More
[15:13.700 --> 15:17.460]  light is the way to go. The light will create the heat for you. Put more lights in there
[15:17.460 --> 15:21.700]  and warm up that grow room with more lights. Of course, if you want to do a heater, do
[15:21.700 --> 15:24.660]  that. You may need a heater in the night cycle if you don't have a way to keep it warm,
[15:24.660 --> 15:28.900]  if you don't have another room to dump the heat into there. But instead of buying a heater,
[15:28.900 --> 15:34.380]  I almost always buy another grow light. Something else to think about is our light schedule.
[15:34.380 --> 15:40.540]  Are we running the lights at the appropriate time? Electricity is overall cheaper at nighttime.
[15:40.540 --> 15:45.060]  During off peak hours, your electricity is cheaper. Everybody's working. Everybody's
[15:45.060 --> 15:49.360]  hustling and bustling. Everyone's at the store, at the office doing stuff from like eight
[15:49.360 --> 15:53.000]  to six in the day, eight in the morning to six in the evening. Everybody's busy doing
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.520]  shit. Electricity is much more expensive then. I think around eight or nine o'clock, your
[15:57.520 --> 16:02.920]  electricity price will drop. It will reduce a little bit. Let's run more of our electrical
[16:02.920 --> 16:07.800]  components during that off peak hour. Then it's a little bit cheaper to run all of your
[16:07.800 --> 16:12.400]  equipment. Also, it's colder then. When the sun goes down, it gets cold outside. Let's
[16:12.400 --> 16:15.840]  turn on the lights while it's cold outside to keep that grow room cold during the coldest
[16:15.840 --> 16:20.480]  part of the day. Then when the lights go off during the day, it's not super cold outside
[16:20.480 --> 16:25.480]  because we got the sun helping us out a little bit. We can use that cheaper lighting, the
[16:25.480 --> 16:30.600]  cheaper electricity, and the sun competition, and the light's heat. Use it all together
[16:30.600 --> 16:36.920]  to create a cheaper, more efficient grow environment. You can do that. A lot of times we'll do that
[16:36.920 --> 16:40.240]  in the summer because it's too damn hot during the day to run the grow lights because you're
[16:40.240 --> 16:43.560]  competing with the sun. Your air conditioner is trying to cool that room. You got lights
[16:43.560 --> 16:47.560]  and the sun to fight with. It's going to get real hot in there. Run your lights during
[16:47.560 --> 16:51.720]  the nighttime during the summer. Also run them during the nighttime during the winter
[16:51.720 --> 16:55.520]  because it gets so cold in the dark time and the nighttime that you want those lights to
[16:55.520 --> 16:59.300]  heat up your space. I hope that made sense because I jumbled my words trying to say that.
[16:59.300 --> 17:05.440]  It made sense to me. One thing that is helpful, these colder temperatures are going to provide
[17:05.440 --> 17:09.960]  beautiful colors for our plants. If you do get that grow room a little bit colder in
[17:09.960 --> 17:14.000]  your night cycle, especially toward the very end of flower, that flush phase, if you can
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.600]  get it a little bit cold in there, that is going to turn your plants, the leaves will
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.040]  get purple, they'll turn red, they'll get yellow fall colors. I really find beauty in
[17:22.040 --> 17:26.640]  those fall winter colors when the plants are finishing. That always comes from my winter
[17:26.640 --> 17:30.560]  crop. Some of my best photos are my winter crops. A lot of people say that their crop
[17:30.560 --> 17:34.920]  around Halloween is always the best indoor crop that they pull. It's so easy because
[17:34.920 --> 17:38.580]  we're not competing with all the heat from the sun. We're not getting as much humidity
[17:38.660 --> 17:43.780]  because it's not as hot. This is prime opportunity for a beautiful winter crop. Where am I going
[17:43.780 --> 17:47.140]  to go from here? I'm going to quickly skim my notes, make sure I didn't skip anything
[17:47.140 --> 17:54.140]  because I'm on a roll. Where are we? All right, here we are. Another thing I want to talk
[17:54.140 --> 17:58.900]  about, this is not seasonal related. This is a trick that I learned. I think I learned
[17:58.900 --> 18:02.060]  this one. I'm going to give credit where credit is due. I think the very first time I ever
[18:02.060 --> 18:06.980]  saw this was my friend Colin Gordon from the Ethos Collective is who showed me this. If
[18:06.980 --> 18:12.020]  you are getting big, giant, chunky buds in your grow room, and this works for any environment,
[18:12.020 --> 18:16.700]  wintertime, summertime, this is for big, chunky buds in a humid room. If you're getting big,
[18:16.700 --> 18:21.180]  fat colas, big, fat buds in your grow room, you get the opportunity for powdery mildew
[18:21.180 --> 18:25.380]  or bud mold, more likely bud mold is what I should have said, in the middle of those
[18:25.380 --> 18:30.460]  big buds. You got a big fucking gallon milk jug size bud. You've got a bunch of miniature
[18:30.460 --> 18:35.020]  buds growing up a stick and they're all kind of gathering up the middle of that stick.
[18:35.020 --> 18:40.700]  I take, I could take, I would recommend you take popsicle sticks or tongue depressors
[18:40.700 --> 18:44.580]  and kind of peel that bud off of the stick a little bit. Don't break it, just pull it
[18:44.580 --> 18:49.500]  back from the stick. You can grab one little bud on a giant cola. You can pull those buds
[18:49.500 --> 18:53.820]  off and put a popsicle stick in there or a tongue depressor in there. Let the bud rest
[18:53.820 --> 18:58.340]  up against the stem again. And now you're going to create airspace between the bud and
[18:58.340 --> 19:03.060]  the stem and the other buds on that stem. And you will drastically reduce your opportunity
[19:03.100 --> 19:07.500]  to get bud mold in the middle of that gigantic bud. I'm going to try to explain that one
[19:07.500 --> 19:11.660]  more time just to make sure I get it clear. You got a big cola, it's growing. It's not
[19:11.660 --> 19:16.540]  really one big bud. It is multiple buds growing really well together on one big stock is what
[19:16.540 --> 19:20.580]  you've got there. When you got that big cola, it looks like a big glory bud. Once it gets
[19:20.580 --> 19:23.740]  to the grow, once it gets to the dispensary environment, it's going to get cut down into
[19:23.740 --> 19:27.660]  little buds. That's a bunch of little buds on one stick. So you got your big stick, you
[19:27.660 --> 19:32.380]  got a bunch of little medium sized buds growing off of it. So you got a stick with the chunky
[19:32.420 --> 19:37.060]  nugget growing off and a chunky nugget growing off and a nugget. You can just pull that nugget
[19:37.060 --> 19:41.340]  out and down a little bit and slide a popsicle stick in there or a tongue depressor in there
[19:41.340 --> 19:45.740]  and let it close on there and hold the stick itself and you will create airspace. Now we're
[19:45.740 --> 19:49.460]  just creating, we're putting a little gap between the other buds and the stick. We can
[19:49.460 --> 19:52.940]  create some airflow in there. Think about all the moisture that is trapped in there.
[19:52.940 --> 19:57.780]  Think about all the microbial activity that could develop inside of that tight space.
[19:57.780 --> 20:01.460]  Your buds are kind of spongy. They hold a lot of moisture. There's not a lot of airflow.
[20:01.500 --> 20:05.460]  So let's open them up, make sure we got a fan in there and that popsicle stick tongue
[20:05.460 --> 20:10.380]  depressor trick may prevent some of the moldy buds that I've seen happening in commercial
[20:10.380 --> 20:13.740]  environments. You guys are striving for those giant buds and you're getting them and then
[20:13.740 --> 20:18.540]  at harvest time we realize, shit, this is all moldy in the middle. I can tell you that
[20:18.540 --> 20:23.420]  I chopped down a white rhino plant. This was probably 10 years ago and Mike will testify
[20:23.420 --> 20:29.460]  to this. I chopped down a white rhino plant that had a top cola the size of two, two liter
[20:29.460 --> 20:34.740]  soda bottles. The bud was probably 30 inches tall. I can't even reach as tall as it was.
[20:34.740 --> 20:39.100]  It was the entire plant was just this one cola and it was as big around as a two liter
[20:39.100 --> 20:44.140]  soda bottle all the way up. It was huge and girthy. We were completely excited about that.
[20:44.140 --> 20:47.480]  We took so many pictures. We've never grown anything like that. I've never done anything
[20:47.480 --> 20:51.580]  like that again because once we harvested it, we started cutting it apart and the entire
[20:51.580 --> 20:56.500]  middle of that whole plant was moldy right up the middle. So all of that product went
[20:56.500 --> 21:01.080]  into a big ass trash can and it went out to the trash. It was gone. It was destroyed.
[21:01.080 --> 21:05.540]  That was considered waste at that point. The way I could have prevented that was obviously
[21:05.540 --> 21:09.220]  a little bit more airflow, but how am I going to get air moving inside of that big giant
[21:09.220 --> 21:13.720]  donkey dick of a bud? I had to open up those buds a little bit, put some tongue depressors
[21:13.720 --> 21:18.000]  or popsicle sticks in there or something non-porous that isn't going to hold moisture. You can
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.860]  use something plastic if you've got it. Tongue depressors and popsicle sticks are readily
[21:21.860 --> 21:25.500]  available. They're very affordable. You can break them in half. You can get two uses out
[21:25.500 --> 21:29.980]  of one popsicle stick. Just spread them around your buds. That will really help you out.
[21:29.980 --> 21:33.460]  I know that sounds random and chaotic to a lot of people, but if you've got a big grow
[21:33.460 --> 21:38.660]  that's at risk of losing product to a bud rot, especially outdoors and in a big grow
[21:38.660 --> 21:42.900]  in a humid area, this will be very useful to you.
[21:42.900 --> 21:45.420]  All right, I'm going to skim one more time. Make sure I got all my notes. I feel like
[21:45.420 --> 21:51.480]  I covered everything. I don't want to go too quickly. The water is cold. Exhaust your heat.
[21:51.480 --> 21:56.680]  Remove the humidity. Don't feed the plants too cold of water. Run the lights during the
[21:56.680 --> 22:01.160]  night or day, depending on your environment. Add more lights to keep it warm. Lower temperatures
[22:01.160 --> 22:06.040]  are going to get your plants colors. Popsicle sticks for giant buds. I really think I covered
[22:06.040 --> 22:09.260]  all of my notes. I want to thank you guys for hanging out for a quick short Grow From
