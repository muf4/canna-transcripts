[00:19.320 --> 00:21.120]  All right, here we go.
[00:21.120 --> 00:22.600]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:22.600 --> 00:28.960]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 659 of the Grow From Your
[00:28.960 --> 00:30.680]  Heart podcast.
[00:30.680 --> 00:34.380]  In this episode, I'm going to talk a little bit about watering our plants, then I'll talk
[00:34.380 --> 00:36.600]  a little bit about a seeded plant.
[00:36.600 --> 00:40.520]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks
[00:40.520 --> 00:43.180]  who support the show on Patreon.

[02:39.020 --> 02:40.820]  I was overwhelmed with work stuff
[02:40.820 --> 02:41.980]  You guys don't care about that
[02:41.980 --> 02:47.340]  But I've been making an effort to be more active on the social media and my discord channel is a place
[02:47.340 --> 02:52.260]  I've really been making an effort to be more present. It's got my name on it. It's got my face on it
[02:52.260 --> 02:54.540]  It's my crew. It's my army. I should be there
[02:54.540 --> 02:58.860]  So I've been trying to be there be more present hang out with the crew pop in share some love

[03:05.420 --> 03:08.420]  I re army grow from your heart discord channel
[03:08.420 --> 03:12.660]  There is a link in the video and show notes description make it nice and easy for you to get there
[03:12.780 --> 03:16.460]  It's a long weird link for me to type. All right, let's move forward
[03:16.460 --> 03:18.260]  What else do I want to say?
[03:18.260 --> 03:22.380]  Oh also make sure you please do like and subscribe to this video in the previous episode
[03:22.380 --> 03:25.700]  I did ask that we get the show to 10,000 subscribers
[03:25.940 --> 03:32.660]  We are almost to 8,000 at the time. I'm recording this probably 7.7. I did not look very recently
[03:32.660 --> 03:34.940]  But we're pretty close to seven point seven thousand
[03:34.940 --> 03:40.740]  So thank you for the big push a lot of my friends did post to social media saying hey, let's get rostage F to 10k
[03:40.740 --> 03:47.000]  I do appreciate all of the support from the community all the love from my friends trying to get us up to 10,000 big love
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.860]  Big respect. Thank you guys for that support. If you haven't already done it, please press that subscribe button
[03:52.180 --> 03:57.460]  Click like on the video maybe type in some comments. Let us know what you think about the show if you're watching on YouTube
[03:57.620 --> 04:01.500]  All right, let's do move forward. I did say that I had some grow lessons
[04:01.500 --> 04:07.340]  We were gonna talk a little bit about watering plants. Um, I've been working with a couple of other people
[04:07.340 --> 04:09.380]  I may be teaching people how to water some plants
[04:09.380 --> 04:13.500]  We don't need to go into too many details about that. But as I was teaching people to water these plants
[04:14.460 --> 04:19.340]  Basically, what I did was I went to their grow and I just stood around and watched them do their thing
[04:19.340 --> 04:22.900]  I kind of acted aloof a little bit. I looked like I was on my phone
[04:22.900 --> 04:25.960]  I looked like I was distracted that was an appearance that I gave on purpose
[04:26.340 --> 04:31.480]  They got comfortable in their grow environment and they did their day in the grow and I just kind of watched and
[04:31.500 --> 04:33.740]  They didn't know I was watching in such detail
[04:33.740 --> 04:37.720]  But I took a few notes on the phone wrote down some ideas thought of ways we can improve their grow
[04:37.720 --> 04:38.940]  That's what I was there for
[04:38.940 --> 04:45.100]  So one of the things I really noticed that these people were doing that they could improve upon I noticed right away is they are
[04:45.100 --> 04:52.660]  Watering the very center of their plants. It doesn't matter what size container you've got if you've got one gallon two gallon three gallons
[04:52.660 --> 04:53.740]  50 gallons
[04:53.740 --> 04:59.860]  It doesn't matter what size your container is it is not ideal to water just the center part of that plant
[04:59.860 --> 05:05.340]  Maybe when that plant is a baby when it's new when it's just getting established and doesn't have a big root system
[05:05.340 --> 05:08.180]  It's okay to water that inner inner circle there
[05:08.220 --> 05:09.660]  But once the plant grows
[05:09.660 --> 05:15.340]  Then we're gonna water want to water the outer part of that plant the roots are only going to grow where there is water
[05:15.340 --> 05:17.060]  It's gonna look they're gonna look for water
[05:17.060 --> 05:22.700]  But if they don't find water, they're just gonna die and those ends are that's where the roots end is where the water doesn't go
[05:23.380 --> 05:28.900]  So if we do water these plants at the outer edge a little bit more the roots will grow out that way
[05:28.900 --> 05:35.880]  We will get bigger bigger roots bigger healthier roots in some ways do translate to bigger healthier fruits. That is
[05:36.460 --> 05:37.700]  Kind of a good catchphrase
[05:37.700 --> 05:43.380]  It's not a hundred percent accurate because I can grow you big-ass plants in tiny pots in a hydro system
[05:43.380 --> 05:48.620]  But if you do have big fat healthy roots, your plants will be more healthy. They can eat better. They could cycle better
[05:48.940 --> 05:51.360]  You can get a longer wet and dry time
[05:51.360 --> 05:54.260]  So if you want to go away for the weekend, you can water them down you could leave
[05:54.300 --> 05:56.660]  Anyway, you want a bigger root system you want to water?
[05:57.340 --> 06:00.860]  Instead of just watering right in the middle because I was watching these people walk up to their pot
[06:00.860 --> 06:03.580]  They'd get their watering container and just pour it right in the middle
[06:03.580 --> 06:07.500]  And I was like you maybe hit like 30% of the root zone of that plant
[06:07.500 --> 06:10.100]  The water is going right down the middle of that pot. It's not spreading out
[06:10.100 --> 06:12.640]  Maybe it is through gravity in the way that it flows
[06:12.640 --> 06:18.580]  But it would have been more ideal to water the whole top part of that plant and let it soak all the way down. I
[06:19.620 --> 06:24.860]  Do apologize for the raspy voice. I promise that didn't happen until I pressed record today, and then I got the raspiness
[06:25.180 --> 06:26.620]  We're gonna fight right through that
[06:26.620 --> 06:31.940]  So water the outer part of the plant not just the newer plant as the plants are growing if they're brand new
[06:32.140 --> 06:34.260]  Absolutely, you do just have to water that inner part
[06:34.260 --> 06:35.260]  That's where the plant is
[06:35.260 --> 06:38.920]  But if you've got the appropriate pot size for your plant and for its roots
[06:39.300 --> 06:42.940]  You should be watering most of that root zone most of that soil zone
[06:43.100 --> 06:48.380]  So don't just water the center water the outside if you think about it, the plants are shaped like an umbrella
[06:48.540 --> 06:52.260]  so if you think about it the rain would come down and the leaves would hit the
[06:52.380 --> 06:57.300]  Rain would hit the top leaves and it would spread it out wider and then it would go down and spread it out wider and go
[06:57.300 --> 06:59.660]  Down and spread it out wider. That's how the leaves are shaped
[06:59.660 --> 07:02.020]  They kind of taper outward in a tier system
[07:02.020 --> 07:04.580]  Just like we build a roof just the way we put the shingles on the roof
[07:04.580 --> 07:08.020]  The water has to flow a certain way. The leaves are already doing that
[07:08.100 --> 07:11.100]  It's probably where we got the idea of how to lay the shingles
[07:11.180 --> 07:16.660]  So the plant the rain will hit the water the water will drip outward and then if you look at the ground where it rains
[07:16.660 --> 07:21.580]  There will be a big circle of water around your plant right under the plant didn't even get watered
[07:21.820 --> 07:25.620]  Because unless water flowed into there, but it was protected from the plant
[07:25.620 --> 07:30.780]  It didn't get hit underneath but all around it is all wet and all that root zone in that big circle is getting wet
[07:30.780 --> 07:35.300]  So if you think about it, the plants do want water at that outer edge. They're shaped like an umbrella
[07:35.660 --> 07:37.860]  So let's get water to that outer edge
[07:38.240 --> 07:42.260]  Then here are some things that will happen your plant will branch out more
[07:42.260 --> 07:47.640]  It won't think it's in a little tiny zone and it will branch out more to get more branching. It'll get more activity
[07:47.640 --> 07:49.640]  It will get more growth
[07:49.640 --> 07:56.160]  Also, I noticed that these people had their plants in too small of a pot those plants weren't gonna grow very big and they weren't
[07:56.800 --> 08:02.200]  They probably were in the right size pot because they weren't watering enough to get them to fill the pot
[08:02.200 --> 08:07.200]  But I would recommend a larger pop in what they were using because their plants are going to get root bound
[08:07.200 --> 08:12.000]  Which is another thing that was causing their plants to get tall and lanky their plants were very tall and skinny
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.120]  So if we water more space to water more space for roots
[08:15.120 --> 08:21.440]  Those plants are gonna grow wider if you've got the root base tucked into a little tiny coffee can they're gonna get tall and skinny
[08:21.440 --> 08:27.040]  If you put into a bigger pot, they're gonna get wider. They'll have more root space. They'll feel more comfortable getting larger
[08:27.880 --> 08:32.980]  Also, their plants were too close together, which wasn't too big of a deal because they were tall and lanky
[08:33.160 --> 08:35.340]  They had a bunch of fish and pole plants going on
[08:36.600 --> 08:40.760]  They were too pressed together too tall and lanky and in too small of a pot
[08:41.200 --> 08:47.880]  They were starting to auto flower because they were so upset they were too close together some of the lower stuff wasn't getting light
[08:47.880 --> 08:50.840]  They didn't clean up any of the bottoms that stuff was starting to auto flower
[08:50.920 --> 08:55.360]  They were pressed so close together the light wasn't getting down into the canopy
[08:55.360 --> 09:02.040]  But having those plants pressed so closely together and not cleaning up the bottoms of them was making them go into flower and the roots
[09:02.040 --> 09:03.760]  Haven't even filled these containers yet
[09:03.760 --> 09:08.680]  So it's way early to flower these plants and it was way early for them to be so tall
[09:08.680 --> 09:11.040]  So these plants were going into flower
[09:11.800 --> 09:14.960]  They were not ready to flower. They were not healthy. They were too tall
[09:14.960 --> 09:17.760]  So the things we can start with is water that outer edge
[09:17.760 --> 09:23.620]  Then another thing we can do is make sure to have our plants far enough apart where they can grow and get some branching on
[09:23.620 --> 09:27.120]  Them then another thing we should do is make sure to up pot at the right time
[09:27.440 --> 09:33.560]  To prevent that early flowering because once they do get root bound they can go into flower early on you
[09:33.560 --> 09:35.120]  All right. I've got a lot of notes in front of me
[09:35.120 --> 09:38.400]  I'm gonna make sure I covered them feel like I covered that section quite quickly
[09:38.680 --> 09:40.720]  I hit all the bullet points I've got here
[09:40.720 --> 09:46.880]  Let's move on to a grow question that came from my friend bro hand 78 on patreon again
[09:46.880 --> 09:53.800]  That is patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. This one says hey Rasta Jeff. I was wondering something
[09:53.800 --> 09:55.800]  I recently grew your golden goat fans
[09:56.040 --> 10:02.000]  You're a very lucky person those golden goat feminine seeds are sold out have it will be sold out for a short time
[10:02.080 --> 10:07.960]  They will be back. But right now you're a lucky person to have those it says they came out beautifully, by the way
[10:08.560 --> 10:11.340]  Thank you, and that's a good work to you. I made good seeds
[10:11.340 --> 10:17.040]  You had to grow them took you nine probably 12 weeks to get that whole project completed. Maybe more good job
[10:17.040 --> 10:22.420]  You did all the hard work. So it says I found one perfect looking seed in a bud
[10:22.640 --> 10:27.840]  There were no males around at all. Would this seed even be viable? Thank you
[10:27.960 --> 10:34.120]  All right, so I've said this several times on several shows before I'm not blaming you nothing for not hearing it
[10:34.120 --> 10:36.160]  But this is my theory on how this works
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.000]  Plants are a lot like Jurassic Park nature finds a way the number one goal for our plants
[10:44.520 --> 10:46.880]  We have a lot of ideas and a lot of goals for them
[10:46.880 --> 10:49.640]  We want to grow them and pop and twist them and defoliate them
[10:49.640 --> 10:54.040]  We want to smoke them and we want them to get us high and we want to turn it into concentrates or baked goods or whatever
[10:54.120 --> 10:58.960]  This plant has one main goal in its own mind and that is to reproduce
[10:59.360 --> 11:02.640]  To make seeds for the next season. That is your plants whole goal
[11:02.640 --> 11:05.960]  If it's a female plant, it wants to get seeded if it's a male plant
[11:05.960 --> 11:13.360]  It wants to do some pollinating. So that is the main goal of this plant. These plants will find a way to survive
[11:13.840 --> 11:18.680]  So it is not uncommon for these plants to kind of just throw one or two random seeds
[11:18.680 --> 11:20.280]  Some people will call it a stress seed
[11:20.280 --> 11:26.920]  Some people will call it a herm seed if you don't see any intersex flowers on that plant, then it's nothing to worry about
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.520]  Sometimes a plant will make a seed because it is striving to survive
[11:32.160 --> 11:36.480]  Oftentimes this is because the plant went a little bit longer than it should have but if you've got one
[11:36.680 --> 11:41.120]  Fully developed perfect looking seed that seed happened early in the flowering process
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.040]  And that that bud just that plant just knew I'm really good bud and we have to continue
[11:46.040 --> 11:49.360]  So it made a seed it is natural life does find a way
[11:49.760 --> 11:52.120]  It's the Jurassic Park theory is what I call it
[11:52.120 --> 11:56.800]  And I think I borrowed that from James Bean so shout out to my buddy James Bean if that is where I learned the Jurassic
[11:56.800 --> 11:59.600]  Park theory so what is happening here is basically
[12:00.400 --> 12:03.800]  Life will find a way there are a few things that could cause this it could have been stress
[12:03.800 --> 12:07.160]  I could have been some intersex trait. It could have just been
[12:07.760 --> 12:13.000]  Life finding a way there's another thing known as I'm gonna say it wrong because I didn't Google the word before
[12:14.080 --> 12:16.080]  Rotalization road. I think it's rotalization
[12:16.720 --> 12:22.960]  Anyway, what it is is growing the plant longer than it needed to flower and then that will make the plant make seeds
[12:23.280 --> 12:26.880]  It doesn't sound like you did that because you probably didn't know the seed was in there
[12:26.880 --> 12:31.960]  You probably just harvested your normal buds and you're grinding up a bowl one day and her tink-tink in the grinder and went
[12:31.960 --> 12:33.680]  Oh, dude, I got a seed in here
[12:33.680 --> 12:36.680]  So we call that a gift. That is a gift
[12:36.680 --> 12:41.120]  That is a freebie seed the follow-up is there were no males around at all yet
[12:41.280 --> 12:46.760]  That's just the life will find a way the will to survive then it says would this seed even be viable?
[12:47.160 --> 12:51.440]  Thanks for your help. Hey, my friend bro. Hand 78. Thank you for the great question
[12:51.640 --> 12:54.920]  This is a good springboard for some rambling here
[12:55.520 --> 12:57.520]  This seed if it looks perfect
[12:58.040 --> 13:00.840]  The only way to find out if it is viable is to grow it
[13:01.440 --> 13:08.080]  Does it sprout? Let's see what happens then veg it up take a clone of it because you may have the next
[13:08.560 --> 13:14.520]  Champion plant this could be something amazing. This could be better than the original golden goat. This could blow golden goat out of the water
[13:15.280 --> 13:16.400]  or
[13:16.400 --> 13:20.400]  This could be complete trash. This could just be something with nanners on it
[13:20.400 --> 13:25.040]  This could just be a totally freaky mutant plant that you want to throw away, but it could be amazing
[13:25.040 --> 13:27.200]  This is how a lot of famous strains were created
[13:27.200 --> 13:31.120]  We're gonna talk about that in a minute, but get a clone of this plant flower it out
[13:31.120 --> 13:35.360]  See what it does smoke it with your friends. Maybe you don't even need to smoke it with that
[13:35.360 --> 13:40.200]  Maybe you're halfway through growing it. You're gonna say look it's nothing but trichomes. It's just a trichome tree
[13:40.200 --> 13:41.160]  Maybe that's what you've got
[13:41.160 --> 13:46.080]  Maybe it's Charlie Brown's Christmas tree and you'll know three weeks into flower that it's a winner or a loser
[13:46.280 --> 13:48.520]  But grow it out finish it up. See what it does
[13:48.840 --> 13:54.840]  Um what you technically have would be labeled bag seed don't call it golden goat
[13:54.880 --> 13:56.960]  Just say it's golden goat bag seed
[13:56.960 --> 14:02.260]  That means it came from a bag of golden goat and it is a seed that we don't know why that seed happened
[14:02.260 --> 14:08.000]  We know it came from golden goat buds. So we know the female was golden goat, but we don't know why that seed happened
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.560]  So we can't label it with a full-on name
[14:10.560 --> 14:16.020]  That's not an a grade seed because we don't know the full pedigree of that. So you've got a bag seed
[14:16.140 --> 14:19.620]  It could be anything it could be amazing it could be trash
[14:19.780 --> 14:24.980]  Let's talk about a few strains that I feel happened this way or any similar manner
[14:24.980 --> 14:30.180]  I feel the original golden goat actually was an accident
[14:30.180 --> 14:35.940]  It was not supposed to be bred a guy had a male plant and he had a female plant and they ax it wasn't me
[14:35.940 --> 14:39.340]  I did not breed the original golden goat, by the way, let me clear that up. That was made by mr
[14:39.340 --> 14:45.260]  Dankin Topeka, Kansas, but mr. Dank's male plant got away from him. It pollinated his female plant
[14:45.460 --> 14:50.620]  He found some seeds in there when he was smoking it or I don't know if he was smoking or what but he found the
[14:50.620 --> 14:53.580]  Seeds that became the golden goat. That was an accident
[14:54.100 --> 14:59.820]  So that was technically bag seed. That's the same scenario, which you've got accidental seed
[14:59.820 --> 15:02.620]  It became golden goat, which is world-renowned
[15:02.620 --> 15:07.840]  It's a famous fucking strain that see those seeds sell out every seed I make sells out immediately
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.020]  So that's a very famous strain and it was made by accident
[15:11.180 --> 15:16.340]  Gorilla glue was made by accident. It's another one of the world's most famous strains
[15:16.340 --> 15:22.980]  It's sought after all of the seeds of gorilla glue gets sold people claim to have gorilla glue glue crosses that they don't have
[15:22.980 --> 15:24.780]  It's clone only
[15:24.780 --> 15:27.520]  Just like the golden goat until we made it into fem seeds
[15:28.060 --> 15:33.940]  But anyway, I digress that one is another accident. We have got the cookies the Girl Scout cookies
[15:33.940 --> 15:40.780]  I suspect I cannot prove but I don't think Girl Scout cookies was really made with anything on purpose or we would know what it
[15:40.780 --> 15:45.900]  Was people would somebody would come forward and say it was this cross to this. I did it in this basement
[15:45.900 --> 15:48.780]  Somebody would say that instead it's shrouded with mystery
[15:48.780 --> 15:54.380]  Which makes me think it was an accidental bag seed that somebody found and they grew and they found a gem just like you possibly
[15:54.380 --> 15:59.440]  Have in there. Let's talk about something else. We should mention all of the chem dog line
[16:00.220 --> 16:04.620]  Everything that came from chem dog genetics started with bag seed
[16:04.620 --> 16:09.540]  I always talk a little bit about chem dog and the legend of the 13 beans
[16:09.540 --> 16:12.460]  I'm not gonna go too deep into it. I don't have any notes
[16:12.460 --> 16:16.240]  I just decided right now that I would kind of update you on the chem dog story. There was a guy
[16:16.420 --> 16:19.180]  He wasn't known as chem dog yet. We're not gonna say his name
[16:19.980 --> 16:23.220]  He went to some Grateful Dead shows and he met up with some guys
[16:23.540 --> 16:28.700]  Named AJ and P bud and AJ and P bud were growing some weed that they called dog
[16:28.700 --> 16:34.860]  But they called it dog bud because when you smoked on it and you smoked it you rolled over on your back like a dog
[16:34.860 --> 16:40.300]  They called it the dog bud some of their friends were calling it the chem weed because it smelled like chemicals
[16:40.300 --> 16:44.780]  They were asking what kind of chemicals they grew it with. This is the best of my recollection of this story
[16:45.020 --> 16:50.780]  So P bud and Joe were growing we're getting I don't know if they were growing it or getting it
[16:50.780 --> 16:53.020]  I don't know that part. They were getting the dog bud
[16:53.820 --> 16:55.100]  they
[16:55.100 --> 16:58.700]  We're calling it dog bud because it would make you stone like a dog
[16:58.700 --> 17:03.120]  You'd lay on your roll over on your back like a dog or they were calling it the chem weed because their friend said it
[17:03.120 --> 17:08.320]  Smelled like chemicals that kind of spawns the name chem dog right there. They were not putting a W in it
[17:08.320 --> 17:11.960]  It was chem dog with an O. So all of us that are using the W
[17:12.600 --> 17:16.520]  We're doing it wrong old-school chem dog with an O not with the W. So
[17:17.080 --> 17:19.400]  These guys run into a guy
[17:20.040 --> 17:24.560]  Whose name will be left out of the story at a Grateful Dead concert at Deer Creek
[17:24.560 --> 17:30.300]  So he buys some weed from him. He realizes this weeds fucking fire. They exchange numbers
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  Grateful Dead tour ends
[17:33.360 --> 17:38.180]  P bud and Joe go back to Colorado allegedly Breckenridge is where I think this where they were from
[17:39.560 --> 17:45.120]  The guy who later becomes chem dog goes back to his place. He contacts them later says I want some herb
[17:46.920 --> 17:52.360]  They teleported them some weed now they fucking mailed it to him allegedly probably I don't know exactly how that happened they got him
[17:52.880 --> 17:59.200]  So the boys in Colorado allegedly got the man who later became chem dog. They got him some product
[17:59.200 --> 18:04.000]  There was allegedly I've heard two different stories. I heard there were three ounces. I heard there were four ounces
[18:04.800 --> 18:08.920]  If anybody wants to chime in somewhere and let me know that I'm all about it
[18:08.920 --> 18:13.480]  I want to get this story right and I just now decided to tell you so I'm trying to remember the best I can from
[18:13.480 --> 18:19.460]  Memory, so these guys get herb to the man who becomes chem dog chem dog finds
[18:19.760 --> 18:24.140]  13 seeds in this bag of weed in the all three ounces or four ounces
[18:24.140 --> 18:28.720]  However many he got there were 13 seeds. He sprouted some of them
[18:29.200 --> 18:34.600]  Some of them were males. They got removed. I've heard him talk on future podcasts. No
[18:34.980 --> 18:37.540]  Yeah, I can't hear him talk on future podcasts
[18:37.540 --> 18:42.220]  But after this story, I heard him talk on podcast those I knew what I meant
[18:42.220 --> 18:42.860]  You knew what I meant
[18:42.860 --> 18:48.500]  I heard him talk on podcasts where he said I wish I knew what I was doing with those males cuz now I kick myself
[18:48.500 --> 18:53.280]  For calling those males. Yeah, bro. Me too. Those males were probably fucking amazing
[18:53.280 --> 18:57.500]  So the chem dog males got tossed there were all the females that he found he kept
[18:57.500 --> 19:03.320]  I think he may have more seeds according to the legend of chem dog in the 13 beans of those 13 beans
[19:03.320 --> 19:07.900]  We got the chem 91. I'm going to guess he popped that in
[19:08.420 --> 19:10.420]  91 we got the chem D
[19:10.420 --> 19:15.360]  Which had a lot of I'm not exactly sure why I got called chem D, but it had a lot of that tennis ball
[19:16.260 --> 19:20.760]  Chemical sort of a smell to it. The chem 91 was skunkier in my opinion
[19:20.760 --> 19:25.020]  That's my favorite is the skunky one. The chem D is kind of gassier and tennis balls
[19:25.500 --> 19:30.060]  Then there's the chem sister and there are other chems that came from that I should have done research
[19:30.060 --> 19:32.940]  But the top three that you'll know are the chem 91
[19:33.460 --> 19:37.520]  The chem D and the chem sister. I don't know if there was one that was just straight called chem dog
[19:37.780 --> 19:44.700]  But that is chem dog is the guy who found those seeds in a bag of weed and he grew them now
[19:44.740 --> 19:51.060]  We're calling the weed chem dog and there is a guy known as chem dog from some seeds that came from bags of weed
[19:51.260 --> 19:55.580]  What you've got is bag seed you could have the next chem dog
[19:55.580 --> 20:02.300]  you could be the guy of legend of the golden goat s1 and the one bean that could be you right now or
[20:03.260 --> 20:06.240]  you could have trash that you should throw away at week four, but
[20:06.780 --> 20:13.060]  That is my recollection of randomly decidingly to deciding to tell you the legend of chem dog in the 13 beans
[20:13.060 --> 20:16.740]  There were two guys in Colorado. They had some herb. They were calling it the dog weed
[20:17.140 --> 20:22.180]  They met a guy at a Grateful Dead show they became friends later on they got him some of the herb
[20:22.180 --> 20:26.540]  He found 13 seeds those 13 seeds netted us some of the most
[20:27.420 --> 20:30.220]  prolific influential cannabis in our
[20:31.020 --> 20:36.740]  Catalog in our gene pool in our fucking culture. Everybody knows what chem dog is. Everybody knows about chem D
[20:37.180 --> 20:44.160]  Everybody smoked chem chem dog you hear about it. It's legendary. So that is where it came from. It was bag seed
[20:45.000 --> 20:49.120]  Recently I had a friend say dude have you shopped at this dispensary and I was like not really shop there
[20:49.120 --> 20:52.480]  He's like they have a shelf that it's all seeded, but the weed is super good
[20:52.480 --> 20:55.920]  But it's got a few seeds in it and I was like how many seeds are in he's like you get like one or two
[20:55.920 --> 20:57.720]  Seeds in eighth and I did the math
[20:57.720 --> 20:59.640]  I got how much is an ounce and he told me I go bro
[20:59.640 --> 21:01.720]  Just go buy an ounce and hope you get ten seeds in there
[21:01.720 --> 21:03.760]  That's like buying a fucking pack of killer seeds
[21:03.760 --> 21:06.520]  If you grow that you're gonna find fire in there and he's like really bro
[21:06.560 --> 21:08.360]  And I was like, those are free seeds, bro
[21:08.360 --> 21:13.560]  Go get those most people are gonna be mad but go buy an ounce and hope you get a 12 pack of free seeds
[21:13.560 --> 21:17.200]  It'll be worth the that's what the out the price of an ounce is
[21:17.200 --> 21:22.560]  What up 10 or 12 pack of seeds would cost you on the market and then basically he's getting an ounce of shitty weed to
[21:22.560 --> 21:25.880]  Go with it. That's the way I thought about it. So I'm go get an ounce of that weed
[21:26.680 --> 21:31.680]  Anyway, I digress I'm rambling. I'm not sure how long I've been going but let's do it this way
[21:31.680 --> 21:35.720]  I've got a lot of editing to do I've been learning a couple of tricks of Final Cut Pro by the way
[21:35.720 --> 21:41.640]  Thank you for all the compliments the feedback all of that good stuff on the last couple of episodes
[21:41.640 --> 21:47.600]  I've been working hard on making creative intros. I've been working hard on just doing some details to make the show better
[21:47.600 --> 21:52.000]  I do appreciate you for watching. I want to keep your attention. I want to be a top-notch podcast
[21:52.000 --> 21:58.720]  I feel like the content coming from this section the notes the show that part is good in my opinion. I could be wrong
[21:58.720 --> 22:01.560]  It's my show, but I feel like the next step is production
[22:01.560 --> 22:05.240]  So thank you for the compliments the words of encouragement the words of wisdom
[22:05.240 --> 22:08.960]  Some people have sent me some feedback and stuff and some advice also. Thank you for all of that
[22:09.280 --> 22:12.080]  Thank you for growing with me and being patient while I grow
[22:12.080 --> 22:15.840]  This is gonna be probably kind of a short episode because I do need to get to editing
[22:15.840 --> 22:22.480]  I need to figure some stuff out also working on color correcting as the next move. I am never the right color in these videos
[22:22.960 --> 22:27.880]  We're gonna figure that shit out one of these days color correction is fun. Anyway, I am rambling
[22:27.880 --> 22:33.160]  I got super stoned before this episode. I've had a good long day finally cooling down a little bit wasn't melting
[22:33.440 --> 22:37.980]  Thank you guys for hanging out. Thank you for joining me for another episode of the grow from your heart podcast you guys
