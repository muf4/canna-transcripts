[01:23.320 --> 01:23.960]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:23.960 --> 01:27.200]  you know I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[01:27.360 --> 01:30.720]  Today I'm taking dabs of some stuff called sinful bananas.
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.160]  This came from Contraband Concentrates.
[01:33.160 --> 01:37.000]  It's the in-house concentrate company at A Cut Above in Colorado Springs.
[01:37.360 --> 01:39.760]  I'm going to pull this out of the container here and give it a fresh smell.
[01:40.040 --> 01:42.800]  And I tell you guys what I think about it. When you smell it,
[01:44.800 --> 01:49.840]  it's got a little funky, like a cookie, cushy kind of an aroma to it.
[01:49.840 --> 01:52.920]  But then when you dab it, it totally tastes like banana runs.
[01:52.920 --> 01:56.360]  If you've ever had a banana run or those little banana shaped candies that come
[01:56.360 --> 01:58.280]  from the little machine, you put your quarter in there,
[01:58.280 --> 02:00.720]  you turn the knob and all the fruit shaped candy comes out.
[02:01.040 --> 02:02.440]  There's some banana shapes in there.
[02:02.720 --> 02:04.360]  That's what this tastes like when you dab it.
[02:04.360 --> 02:06.920]  I'm going to grab the little package here and we'll read some test results on
[02:06.920 --> 02:11.920]  here. It's got a nice lab test result of 87.8% THC.
[02:12.720 --> 02:17.680]  And the description is sin mint cookies and honey bananas blended perfectly.
[02:17.880 --> 02:22.080]  I would agree with that. Delicious concentrate. It's got a nice headstone.
[02:22.080 --> 02:23.600]  It went right to my eyes, right to my head.
[02:23.600 --> 02:26.480]  It made my shoulders nice and relaxed, nice mellow indica stone.
[02:26.480 --> 02:29.520]  I would say great concentrate. Something new. I haven't tried that before.
[02:29.720 --> 02:32.960]  So I'm digging the sinful bananas sauce. I've got to say,
[02:32.960 --> 02:37.000]  I really enjoy the texture and consistency. I complain a lot that when I buy sauce,
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.240]  it's too saucy, which sounds ridiculous,
[02:39.240 --> 02:42.320]  but there's just too much terp water in there. And I don't,
[02:42.440 --> 02:44.520]  that's not what I prefer. I prefer more crystals.
[02:44.840 --> 02:47.720]  These guys put plenty of crystals in there. The crystals aren't tiny,
[02:47.880 --> 02:51.920]  but they're also not so huge that you're smoking all of the gram in two dabs
[02:51.920 --> 02:56.640]  because the crystals are so big. So great consistency. I do approve.
[02:57.000 --> 02:58.640]  All right, you guys, let's move forward with the podcast.
[02:58.640 --> 03:00.840]  We have got a lot of stuff to cover.
[03:01.040 --> 03:05.160]  Somebody threw down a very large, generous Patreon contribution.
[03:05.160 --> 03:08.760]  In my opinion, it was a very generous, very generous contribution.
[03:09.120 --> 03:10.440]  They don't want me to say their name on the show,
[03:10.440 --> 03:13.040]  but I want to make sure that I say thank you on the air, dude.
[03:13.240 --> 03:17.320]  Thank you for the very generous Patreon contribution. I do appreciate that.
[03:17.560 --> 03:20.600]  Also thanks to everybody else who has pitched in on Patreon.
[03:20.840 --> 03:22.240]  I appreciate all of the support.
[03:22.440 --> 03:23.680]  And if you don't know what I'm talking about,
[03:23.680 --> 03:27.080]  make sure you check out patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[03:27.360 --> 03:29.120]  All the information you need will be right there.
[03:29.120 --> 03:31.760]  We'll talk about that at the end of the show. Again, you guys,
[03:31.760 --> 03:32.920]  I have a bunch of notes written down,
[03:32.920 --> 03:35.600]  but I think I'm going to save a couple of them for the next episode.
[03:35.760 --> 03:38.800]  Real quick shout out to Oklahoma, real quick shout out to Canada.
[03:38.800 --> 03:41.120]  I hope to get with Mike and do longer episodes about that.
[03:41.480 --> 03:43.440]  But one thing I do want to mention, you guys,
[03:43.440 --> 03:46.800]  the podcast was ranked 635 on Stitcher.
[03:47.040 --> 03:50.080]  There are 40,000 podcasts available on Stitcher,
[03:50.280 --> 03:55.000]  and I'm sure there are at least 15 to 25 cannabis related podcasts available.
[03:55.280 --> 03:58.280]  And you guys are choosing to listen to my little show. So thank you.
[03:58.560 --> 04:01.840]  That means a lot to me. I genuinely appreciate the love and support.
[04:01.840 --> 04:04.280]  You guys are blowing me up with emails, with messages,
[04:04.280 --> 04:07.600]  with Instagram interactions, with Patreon contributions.
[04:08.040 --> 04:11.440]  It has been a lot of fun lately. I have made a bunch of changes in my life.
[04:11.720 --> 04:15.040]  I was a little concerned about things and you guys have reassured me that
[04:15.080 --> 04:18.400]  everything will be just fine. So thank you guys for the love and support.
[04:19.120 --> 04:23.320]  We're ranked 635 out of 40,000 shows on Stitcher. And you guys,
[04:23.320 --> 04:26.280]  a lot of people are still telling me they're having problems with Stitcher
[04:26.480 --> 04:29.320]  intermittently. Randomly Stitcher won't work for you.
[04:29.840 --> 04:33.120]  That means there are people trying to listen that aren't able to listen.
[04:33.280 --> 04:36.080]  I'm willing to bet that once I get that issue corrected,
[04:36.600 --> 04:40.880]  we will get into the top 500 on Stitcher. So thank you guys.
[04:40.920 --> 04:43.960]  I appreciate all the clicks, all the listens, all the downloads,
[04:44.440 --> 04:46.400]  all the interaction. It means a lot to me.
[04:48.080 --> 04:51.520]  Also I've been posting videos up on YouTube and you guys have been watching
[04:51.640 --> 04:54.600]  like crazy. As soon as I post those videos, people start watching.
[04:54.640 --> 04:56.440]  I appreciate that. Thank you guys.
[04:56.520 --> 04:58.720]  What I'm trying to say is thank you for all of the support.
[04:58.720 --> 05:02.960]  It means the world to me. I never expected a little podcast to get this far.
[05:03.200 --> 05:05.240]  I was just doing this because I wanted to talk about weed.
[05:05.240 --> 05:07.200]  I wanted to correct some things I read on the internet.
[05:07.920 --> 05:11.000]  I really didn't think I'd get 300 and something episodes in. And now you guys,
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.880]  I see no end in sight. So thank you. I appreciate it.
[05:14.600 --> 05:16.520]  Now let's get into the main part of this podcast.
[05:16.520 --> 05:19.200]  I've been rambling for about five minutes and we haven't touched on the main
[05:19.240 --> 05:20.960]  topic of this podcast.
[05:21.400 --> 05:25.400]  I've gotten a lot of positive feedback on the strain report episodes that I've
[05:25.400 --> 05:28.880]  done in the past. I've done strain reports on Morning Dew,
[05:29.120 --> 05:30.800]  Firefly and The Cream.
[05:31.200 --> 05:34.640]  The responses to those episodes are overwhelming and you guys have been asking
[05:34.640 --> 05:39.000]  for more. So today we're going to feature Arise.
[05:39.160 --> 05:43.840]  Arise is one of my proudest creations. Arise and probably Lemon Jeffrey.
[05:43.840 --> 05:47.920]  Arise and Lemon Jeffrey would rival for top two with Grateful Dog in there for
[05:47.920 --> 05:50.880]  top three. We can talk about that in the future.
[05:51.520 --> 05:53.840]  But currently Arise is one of my favorites to work with.
[05:53.840 --> 05:55.160]  I've been breeding with Arise.
[05:55.280 --> 05:58.200]  I've got a male Arise plant that I call King Solomon.
[05:58.400 --> 06:00.840]  He is what I've been making a lot of my fresh creations with.
[06:01.320 --> 06:06.560]  Arise tests consistently in the high twenties and low 30%
[06:06.680 --> 06:07.640]  THCA.
[06:08.640 --> 06:11.480]  Our friends at Organica in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
[06:11.680 --> 06:14.840]  grew some seeds that I gave them. They grew the Arise seeds.
[06:15.600 --> 06:18.120]  They had it tested at Steep Hill Labs.
[06:18.200 --> 06:23.400]  That lab test was tested one time and it revealed 35.84%
[06:23.400 --> 06:27.160]  THC. Steep Hill insisted on testing it again.
[06:27.640 --> 06:31.400]  Then they tested it a third time. And after that third test,
[06:31.520 --> 06:36.000]  they decided to call and tell our friends at Organica that we had hit 35.84%
[06:37.120 --> 06:41.680]  THCA. And it was the record of highest THCA test at that time.
[06:41.880 --> 06:43.800]  I don't know if anything has tested higher than that,
[06:43.920 --> 06:45.320]  but at one point in time,
[06:45.440 --> 06:50.080]  Arise held the record for highest THC lab test with Steep Hill Labs.
[06:50.160 --> 06:54.440]  And that was grown again by our friends at Organica in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[06:54.920 --> 06:57.520]  And it's not just the lab test that makes me super proud of Arise,
[06:57.520 --> 07:00.680]  although that does, that is bragging rights. And that is something I can show,
[07:00.960 --> 07:04.320]  but I think I nailed what I was going for when I made the cross.
[07:04.600 --> 07:08.880]  I took an OG Kush kind of a diesel chemi dominant plant and crossed it with a
[07:08.880 --> 07:10.560]  candy flavored tropical plant.
[07:10.920 --> 07:14.200]  And I got that perfect 50 50 Indica sativa balance.
[07:14.440 --> 07:18.080]  It seems to work very well medicinally for a lot of people.
[07:18.080 --> 07:21.640]  And it seems to work very well recreational for a lot of people. So I,
[07:21.920 --> 07:26.000]  I feel like I made a great strain. I hit my target. It's got a great cushy flavor.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.120]  It's got a great tropical flavor. It's a very versatile strain.
[07:29.120 --> 07:33.440]  It tests high and people have been reporting great results using it medically.
[07:33.920 --> 07:37.600]  And I feel like it gets me so lit that I am smoking it recreationally.
[07:37.640 --> 07:41.240]  When I smoke Arise, I only need one medical dab of Arise.
[07:41.240 --> 07:43.720]  The second dab of Arise, that's all recreational.
[07:44.120 --> 07:47.080]  I also like the way Arise grows. She's very consistent.
[07:47.120 --> 07:49.440]  I also like breeding with Arise like I've mentioned before.
[07:49.680 --> 07:52.480]  Arise is just a great strain to work with. It's got a great structure.
[07:52.640 --> 07:54.840]  There's so many great things about Arise.
[07:54.960 --> 07:57.720]  So let's talk a little bit about the parents of Arise.
[07:57.760 --> 07:58.920]  We'll get into the details here.
[07:58.920 --> 08:01.920]  The parents of Arise are a golden goat female.
[08:02.240 --> 08:06.840]  Golden goat is Island sweet skunk cross to Hawaiian sativa and Romulan.
[08:07.600 --> 08:10.880]  A lot of people on the internet give me credit for making golden goat.
[08:10.960 --> 08:14.440]  I did not do that. I made golden goat and feminized seed.
[08:14.560 --> 08:16.520]  I did not create golden goat.
[08:16.560 --> 08:20.560]  Golden goat was made by a guy named Mr. Dank and it's from Topeka, Kansas.
[08:20.760 --> 08:22.200]  So that's a little knowledge for you.
[08:22.200 --> 08:24.080]  We'll talk about golden goat in the future also.
[08:24.760 --> 08:26.720]  A golden goat is kind of a tropical sativa.
[08:27.360 --> 08:30.880]  It doesn't grow super tall and it doesn't grow super skinny.
[08:30.960 --> 08:35.120]  That's because they cross all of those sativas with the Romulan and it kind of
[08:35.120 --> 08:37.520]  keeps it short and it kind of lowered the flower time.
[08:37.720 --> 08:42.160]  But it's still kept that tropical sativa flavor and the skinny leaves and that
[08:42.160 --> 08:46.320]  tropical head high golden goats got some great tropical candy flavors.
[08:46.520 --> 08:50.000]  It's kind of sweet and fruity. It tastes like that, uh, that gum, some, uh,
[08:50.320 --> 08:51.560]  some juicy fruit gum,
[08:51.920 --> 08:54.720]  or maybe there used to be these generic candies that used to just come in a
[08:54.720 --> 08:56.920]  plastic sleeve and they were kind of fruity flavored.
[08:57.120 --> 09:00.280]  That's kind of what the golden goat tastes like. Sometimes golden goat is
[09:00.280 --> 09:02.080]  actually named. Here's a little bit of knowledge.
[09:02.320 --> 09:06.240]  Golden goat is actually named for the golden goat recycling center.
[09:06.520 --> 09:09.920]  The guy that made golden goat lived near a place called the golden goat
[09:09.920 --> 09:12.520]  recycling center where people would recycle cans.
[09:12.840 --> 09:14.720]  And he said that in the middle of the summer,
[09:15.040 --> 09:17.440]  it made this sticky sweet smell in the air.
[09:17.600 --> 09:20.600]  And he said that's what the golden goat plant reminded him of.
[09:20.800 --> 09:23.720]  And I could see that it's fruity and soda can like,
[09:23.720 --> 09:26.680]  so if you had a whole bunch of syrupy soda, that was like,
[09:26.840 --> 09:29.760]  you had some orange soda in there, maybe mixing in with all the colas,
[09:30.120 --> 09:33.240]  it would definitely give you that golden goat sweetness kind of smell.
[09:33.560 --> 09:36.120]  So that's golden goat. It stays short. It stays squat.
[09:36.720 --> 09:39.240]  It's Island sweet skunk and it's Hawaiian sativa,
[09:39.240 --> 09:41.360]  which gives it that tropical flavor in the head high.
[09:41.600 --> 09:45.520]  Then they cross the Romulan in there and that keeps it short and stocky and
[09:45.520 --> 09:48.200]  makes it grow early or makes it flower early and finish early.
[09:48.640 --> 09:51.600]  And it's got that candy flavor and a super sativa head high.
[09:51.600 --> 09:53.040]  It gives some people panic attacks.
[09:53.040 --> 09:56.600]  I smoked some golden goat with a girl one time and I just had to take her home.
[09:56.600 --> 09:57.720]  That was the end of that day.
[09:58.040 --> 10:02.000]  So that is the female part of a rise.
[10:02.200 --> 10:05.080]  The male, the daddy was daybreaker.
[10:05.400 --> 10:09.560]  Daybreaker is chem D which is gassy, funky,
[10:09.800 --> 10:14.200]  featy kind of burnt rubber, fresh tennis balls, sort of a smell.
[10:14.520 --> 10:18.720]  And then it's got Joseph OG in the mix for that OG kush, dirty feet,
[10:18.960 --> 10:21.080]  funk earth coffee sort of a flavor.
[10:21.080 --> 10:26.080]  So daybreaker gives off a diesel E chemi smelling kush sort of a thing.
[10:26.480 --> 10:31.040]  It's diesel kush chem fuel earth, just funky stuff,
[10:31.080 --> 10:33.400]  dirty feet, a little bit of armpits in there maybe.
[10:33.760 --> 10:37.160]  And the daybreaker has a very nice, I call it a complete high.
[10:37.160 --> 10:40.360]  It's got a really good head buzz because it's got that chem D in there.
[10:40.680 --> 10:44.240]  And then it's got a really heavy body stone because it's got that Joseph OG in
[10:44.240 --> 10:47.120]  there. I think daybreaker was a really great strain,
[10:47.120 --> 10:50.600]  but it leaned really heavy on that gassy, cushy, fuely side.
[10:50.960 --> 10:54.760]  And then I saw that tropical flavor coming out of golden goat and they both grew
[10:54.760 --> 10:56.320]  with a nice stout structure. And I was like,
[10:56.320 --> 11:00.320]  that would make a really beautiful cross. So that's what gave me the idea.
[11:00.600 --> 11:03.080]  That's where they came from and that's how it started.
[11:03.080 --> 11:06.920]  So now that we know who the parents are, we can talk about Arise.
[11:07.080 --> 11:11.920]  Arise is a very great balance of sativa and indica with a few phenotypes that
[11:11.920 --> 11:14.440]  lean heavily in one direction, which is expected.
[11:14.960 --> 11:17.480]  Most phenotypes will finish in nine weeks.
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.080]  There will be some eight week and some 10 week finishers in the mix because
[11:22.520 --> 11:25.360]  you're going to bring out some of that Island sweet skunk and some of that
[11:25.360 --> 11:28.600]  Hawaiian sativa that's going to take a little longer to finish.
[11:28.760 --> 11:30.280]  That's going to show up in the F1s.
[11:30.720 --> 11:33.760]  The Arise seeds that you guys are getting from Dank Seed or from me,
[11:33.760 --> 11:34.880]  those are F1s.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.800]  So all of this is going to apply to those F1 Arise seeds that you're getting.
[11:39.240 --> 11:40.440]  I have made F2s,
[11:40.560 --> 11:43.240]  but I haven't released them yet because I haven't done enough testing and I
[11:43.240 --> 11:45.480]  don't want to see anybody have any problems.
[11:45.480 --> 11:48.320]  And I probably won't release the F2, I'll work it to an F3,
[11:48.320 --> 11:51.840]  and then you'll get some of the F3s and the packages will be labeled as such.
[11:51.840 --> 11:54.840]  But for now you're getting F1s. Let's talk more about those.
[11:55.160 --> 11:57.720]  You're going to get stuff that finishes, uh, what was I saying?
[11:57.880 --> 11:59.280]  In eight to 10 weeks. Uh,
[11:59.320 --> 12:02.640]  my favorite finishes right around day 63 to 65.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  The eight week phenotype that you'll find is very Joseph OG dominant,
[12:07.280 --> 12:11.120]  but it doesn't produce as tight a buds as the Joseph OG.
[12:11.160 --> 12:14.960]  It's just a little fluffier and she's not very high of a yielder. It's not,
[12:15.200 --> 12:17.440]  doesn't throw out as much as the other phenotypes.
[12:18.040 --> 12:22.200]  The 10 week phenotype shows the Hawaiian sativa or the Island sweet skunk
[12:22.200 --> 12:24.600]  structure, and it makes long skinny buds.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.440]  That how the Hawaiian sativa and the Island sweet skunk,
[12:27.480 --> 12:29.000]  those are going to get long and stretchy on you.
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.480]  So if you see that long stretchiness expect some tropical smell,
[12:32.600 --> 12:36.680]  some tropical flavors, some saltwater, some taffy, some fruits, some pineapples,
[12:36.680 --> 12:39.400]  some oranges. There's so many weird things that come out of that one.
[12:39.400 --> 12:43.080]  I really like it. But that 10 week phenotype is covered in trichomes.
[12:43.080 --> 12:46.920]  You guys, it is just frosty as shit, soaked in trichomes,
[12:47.200 --> 12:51.400]  but it doesn't produce very dense buds. They're kind of fluffy.
[12:51.600 --> 12:55.720]  The 10 week phenotype smells like it's bringing out all that Hawaiian flavor and
[12:55.720 --> 12:59.680]  the goat sweetness and the head high from the 10 week phenotype is amazing.
[13:00.000 --> 13:00.920]  That 10 weeker,
[13:01.200 --> 13:04.880]  if you let her go 10 weeks and finish out and you're not a seasoned smoker,
[13:04.880 --> 13:08.000]  or if you're smoking with new people, it will give them a panic attack.
[13:08.560 --> 13:10.080]  And you can hear that. I say that with a smile.
[13:10.080 --> 13:12.720]  I kind of enjoy panic attack weed. That's kind of a good thing.
[13:12.720 --> 13:14.600]  I'd rather get energized and like, Oh shit.
[13:14.600 --> 13:16.280]  Then just want to sit there in the corner and hide.
[13:16.560 --> 13:21.320]  But my favorite phenotypes of RISE are the balanced mixes that have the
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.040]  goat sweetness and the cushy stankiness. It's got this,
[13:25.040 --> 13:27.280]  when you light it up, everybody goes, what?
[13:27.280 --> 13:30.360]  It smells like cushy stank at first. And then you puff on it.
[13:30.360 --> 13:33.920]  And when you exhale this sweetness just comes out. It is really nice.
[13:33.920 --> 13:38.880]  But overall I would narrow down the morphology of a RISE to around three
[13:38.880 --> 13:42.120]  common phenotypes and three less common phenotypes.
[13:42.120 --> 13:45.120]  And I know I said there are six phenotypes, but it is an F1 hybrid.
[13:45.320 --> 13:49.400]  So variation is to be expected. And honestly, I like variation.
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.200]  I think that variation is a way to customize and custom tailor our gardens to
[13:53.200 --> 13:56.040]  our needs while still growing the strain that we're looking for.
[13:56.600 --> 13:59.600]  Variation is to be expected. Keep that in mind when you're growing from seed,
[13:59.600 --> 14:01.280]  especially with an F1 hybrid.
[14:01.440 --> 14:05.800]  So we've got three common and three less common phenotypes.
[14:05.800 --> 14:09.680]  And I have identified them as the sativa heavy, the indica heavy,
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.080]  the goat phenotype, the daybreaker phenotype, the 50-50,
[14:14.120 --> 14:16.680]  and the one that I call the stretcher.
[14:16.920 --> 14:19.320]  And I don't call it the stretcher because it's going to put you on a stretcher.
[14:19.320 --> 14:21.240]  I call it the stretcher because it grows like me.
[14:21.240 --> 14:23.080]  It's fucking tall and skinny and out of control.
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.600]  So let's talk a little bit about the six different phenotypes.
[14:27.600 --> 14:30.120]  And you're going to see a little bit of variation. You know what I mean?
[14:30.120 --> 14:32.800]  It's not going to be fucking, that's exactly this one,
[14:32.960 --> 14:34.480]  but they're going to fall into this category.
[14:34.680 --> 14:37.880]  You guys will catch onto this as we do more pheno hunts and as we do more strain
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.880]  episodes. So the sativa heavy phenotype of a RISE is a little airy.
[14:43.480 --> 14:46.600]  It smells like beach sand and juicy fruit gum.
[14:47.080 --> 14:51.080]  It's got a tropical aroma to it and it smells like saltwater.
[14:51.080 --> 14:53.480]  It smells like you're sitting on the beach in Hawaii.
[14:53.840 --> 14:55.440]  It certainly has a tropical smell.
[14:55.440 --> 14:59.120]  It certainly brings out that Island sweet skunk and that Hawaiian sativa flavor.
[14:59.680 --> 15:03.960]  The phenotype that I've labeled as the sativa dominant phenotype or the sativa
[15:03.960 --> 15:06.440]  heavy phenotype will get really tall.
[15:06.440 --> 15:10.120]  And there's a lot of space between the nodes. That's one way to identify it.
[15:10.360 --> 15:13.680]  That is the Hawaiian. If there is a lot of spacing in your nodes,
[15:13.760 --> 15:18.880]  you're going to get that sativa heavy, tall, super sativa, high THC plant,
[15:18.880 --> 15:20.920]  but there'll be a lot of stretching. It's going to get really tall.
[15:20.920 --> 15:25.040]  And it's going to take 10 weeks, but it will test very high in THC.
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.360]  So that's the sativa heavy phenotype. It will be very obvious.
[15:28.680 --> 15:32.640]  It is tall and skinny and it takes off. Sometimes it's confused as a boy.
[15:32.880 --> 15:36.760]  It may be a boy, but also it could be that crazy sativa heavy phenotype.
[15:36.760 --> 15:39.960]  So the next one we'll talk about is the indica heavy phenotype.
[15:39.960 --> 15:44.440]  The indica heavy smells like cush and feet with a little bit of that golden
[15:44.440 --> 15:45.160]  goat sweetness.
[15:45.160 --> 15:50.000]  It is mostly Joseph OG and it's got a little bit of that Kim D in there
[15:50.640 --> 15:53.320]  and it's stinky like feet and funk and armpits.
[15:53.320 --> 15:56.120]  And it's got a little bit of like a fresh tire shop,
[15:56.160 --> 15:59.800]  that rubber smell at the tire shop. It's got a little bit of that going on to it.
[16:00.760 --> 16:03.120]  It's going to be shorter. It's going to be shorter plants.
[16:03.720 --> 16:05.200]  It's going to have tighter node spacing.
[16:05.220 --> 16:07.480]  It's going to be kind of stretchy from the Joseph OG.
[16:07.680 --> 16:09.640]  So the node spacing will be close together,
[16:09.640 --> 16:14.440]  but then the branches that come off will be kind of long and the bud sets from
[16:14.680 --> 16:16.520]  up that branch will be kind of far apart.
[16:16.520 --> 16:19.000]  It's going to grow more golf ball type stuff.
[16:19.600 --> 16:23.160]  It's going to have very Joseph OG dominant traits is the indica heavy one.
[16:23.600 --> 16:26.020]  So if you see just a bunch of golf balls popping up a stick,
[16:26.020 --> 16:29.160]  you're going to have that Joseph OG, that foot, cush,
[16:29.200 --> 16:32.920]  earth sort of smelling phenotype. I enjoy it. It's not my favorite,
[16:32.940 --> 16:35.520]  but it is a good phenotype if you're going for that indica.
[16:36.040 --> 16:40.720]  Uh, that one takes about 56 to 63 days for the indica phenotype.
[16:40.920 --> 16:42.360]  Let it go to about 60 days.
[16:42.360 --> 16:45.320]  If you're getting eager and you think it's done at 56, let it go to 60.
[16:45.560 --> 16:49.120]  See what it does. You've got an indica plant, let it ripen up a little extra.
[16:49.360 --> 16:52.400]  You may enjoy that. It'll be super stony for you. All right.
[16:52.400 --> 16:54.520]  Number three is the golden goat phenotype.
[16:54.520 --> 16:58.040]  This one looks and smells very similarly to golden goat.
[16:58.040 --> 17:00.360]  So let's talk about the way this one grows.
[17:00.840 --> 17:05.000]  The golden goat phenotype obviously looks and smells a lot like golden goat.
[17:05.280 --> 17:07.680]  It will stay a little shorter. It'll stay squat.
[17:07.960 --> 17:11.720]  The main top will not get way above the rest of the plant.
[17:11.720 --> 17:15.160]  Like some strains like to do the golden goat phenotype likes to stay kind of
[17:15.160 --> 17:18.200]  even. It will have a dominant top, but it will stay a little bit shorter.
[17:18.200 --> 17:22.360]  And that's a trait from the Romulan. Sometimes with the golden goat phenotype,
[17:22.360 --> 17:26.240]  you will see spiraled growth. Now, a lot of times when you're growing a plant,
[17:26.440 --> 17:29.000]  the main stock comes up, you get two nodes that come out.
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.520]  We'll call that East and West. You get two East and West growing nodes,
[17:32.720 --> 17:35.040]  then two North and South growing nodes come out.
[17:35.040 --> 17:38.280]  So you've got a plus sign, basically a plant with a symmetrical.
[17:38.280 --> 17:40.280]  You got two coming out this way, two coming out this way.
[17:40.280 --> 17:43.440]  And then it will repeat that process. And you'll have North and South,
[17:43.440 --> 17:45.240]  East and West North and South, East and West.
[17:45.640 --> 17:50.440]  Golden goat carries a trait that will make plants produce sets of six
[17:50.440 --> 17:53.760]  branches. So instead of every 90 degrees, you have a branch.
[17:54.040 --> 17:56.160]  It will be every 60 degrees.
[17:56.280 --> 18:00.240]  So there will be one branch and then 60 degrees and another branch.
[18:00.400 --> 18:04.120]  So right before you would have that North and South, East and West,
[18:04.120 --> 18:07.320]  it would go a little bit shorter and it would make room for another set of two.
[18:07.560 --> 18:11.640]  So you'd have triple the branching off of that. I call it spiraled growth.
[18:12.120 --> 18:13.600]  You'll notice it if it's doing that.
[18:14.040 --> 18:17.880]  The golden goat phenotype smells very sweet like golden goat.
[18:17.920 --> 18:20.320]  It's got very short, tight node spacing,
[18:20.600 --> 18:25.360]  and it takes about 56 to 63 days for that phenotype to
[18:25.360 --> 18:26.180]  finish up.
[18:26.560 --> 18:30.120]  Some of the visual differences between the golden goat and the daybreaker,
[18:30.560 --> 18:34.600]  are the daybreaker phenotypes are a little tighter and rockier.
[18:34.600 --> 18:37.720]  And the golden goat kind of has more of a jagged edge to it.
[18:37.720 --> 18:40.280]  It's a little pointier and it comes out a little fluffier.
[18:40.280 --> 18:42.600]  So you'll be able to tell the difference between the golden goat and the
[18:42.600 --> 18:43.800]  daybreaker phenotypes.
[18:44.080 --> 18:46.720]  Now let's talk about the daybreaker phenotype specifically.
[18:47.080 --> 18:51.000]  The daybreaker phenotype looks and smells obviously like daybreaker.
[18:51.240 --> 18:53.880]  She gets tall, but she stacks up with huge colas.
[18:53.880 --> 18:56.440]  All that tall space is going to turn into a giant bud.
[18:56.800 --> 18:59.960]  She stretches a little bit in early flower because of the OG dad.
[19:00.520 --> 19:03.160]  The gas is more prevalent in the daybreaker phenotype.
[19:03.160 --> 19:06.320]  If you're looking for the gas, you want the daybreaker leaning phenotype.
[19:06.920 --> 19:11.120]  This one's got tight node spacing, but the branches do stretch in early flower.
[19:11.320 --> 19:13.400]  And that is from the Joseph OG.
[19:13.840 --> 19:17.160]  Now you've got a pretty good description of the Indica heavy, the sativa heavy,
[19:17.280 --> 19:20.400]  the golden goat and the daybreaker. You're going to have golden goat flavors.
[19:20.400 --> 19:23.160]  You're going to have tropical flavors. You're going to have airy, fluffier buds.
[19:23.440 --> 19:25.000]  You're going to have sativa dominant stuff.
[19:25.040 --> 19:26.760]  Then you're going to have these tight golf ball,
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.400]  little rocky buds that smell like fuel and cush,
[19:29.440 --> 19:33.240]  or you're going to get really obviously sativa tropical plants,
[19:33.280 --> 19:37.160]  or you're going to get really obviously Indica dominant cushy plants,
[19:37.200 --> 19:42.160]  or maybe hopefully you get the one I call the 50 50 mix,
[19:42.200 --> 19:44.360]  the arise that everybody's looking for.
[19:44.360 --> 19:48.320]  This is the mix that grows like Kim D and the goat mixed together.
[19:48.320 --> 19:51.040]  You can see that tall Kim D stout structure.
[19:51.280 --> 19:55.440]  You can see the branchiness and the strength of the golden goat,
[19:55.600 --> 20:00.400]  but it smells like Joseph OG with the hint of tropical sweetness at the end of
[20:00.400 --> 20:04.240]  it. I love the 50 50 mix. You can see all of the parents in there.
[20:04.240 --> 20:08.080]  You can see the Kim D you can see the golden goat. You can see the Joseph OG.
[20:08.280 --> 20:09.960]  You can see the Hawaiian sativa in there.
[20:09.960 --> 20:13.200]  You can smell that Hawaiian sativa and the Island sweet skunk.
[20:13.440 --> 20:18.080]  The 50 50 is obviously my favorite. That's the phenotype I keep around.
[20:18.080 --> 20:21.600]  It's the phenotype that tests in the 30% bracket consistently.
[20:22.040 --> 20:24.800]  This phenotype gives me a ripping head high.
[20:25.000 --> 20:26.760]  It will make you forget what's going on,
[20:26.960 --> 20:29.440]  but it also will make your whole body relax.
[20:29.440 --> 20:33.760]  You will sit down on the couch to watch an episode of Rick and Morty or Bob's
[20:33.760 --> 20:37.800]  burgers, and he will press play on the DVR and he will sit in that seat,
[20:37.800 --> 20:40.280]  but you will not remember watching the episode.
[20:40.320 --> 20:42.760]  That's the kind of high that arise gives you.
[20:43.240 --> 20:46.600]  Remember on Friday when Craig was talking to the dog statue and he was brushing
[20:46.600 --> 20:48.160]  his shirt off and brushing his pants off.
[20:48.520 --> 20:50.440]  That's the kind of high that arise gives you.
[20:50.960 --> 20:53.720]  I think it's a really balanced high. I really liked the body stone.
[20:53.720 --> 20:56.640]  I really liked the head high. I really enjoy arise.
[20:56.640 --> 20:59.560]  That's why it's one of my favorites. It tests high, it grows great.
[20:59.640 --> 21:03.480]  And I just love the high that it gives me. The flowers just make me,
[21:03.640 --> 21:04.640]  I feel it in my face.
[21:04.640 --> 21:08.640]  I feel it in my eyes and the dabs are just super intense. Uh, it's,
[21:08.640 --> 21:11.240]  it's mostly recreational when I'm smoking arise.
[21:11.240 --> 21:13.560]  It just goes straight to the brain. It makes me goofy.
[21:13.560 --> 21:14.440]  It makes me want to chill out.
[21:14.440 --> 21:16.760]  It makes me want to play music and it makes me want to talk a lot.
[21:16.960 --> 21:20.560]  So let's keep talking about this specific phenotype, the 50 50 phenotype.
[21:20.560 --> 21:24.840]  This phenotype puts out huge harvest. It's fairly easy to grow.
[21:25.200 --> 21:29.600]  You can top it or you can not top it and it will grow like crazy.
[21:30.160 --> 21:33.560]  You'll recognize this phenotype when it's growing because it will have a long
[21:33.560 --> 21:36.600]  chunky bud and it'll look like it's got that chem D structure,
[21:36.600 --> 21:40.720]  but then the leaves will get long and skinny and they will kind of taco up just
[21:40.720 --> 21:44.200]  a little bit. They won't be fat leaves. If they're big and fat leaves,
[21:44.200 --> 21:46.400]  it's probably not the 50 50 phenotype.
[21:46.400 --> 21:50.120]  They get a little bit skinnier and really pointy and then they kind of taco and
[21:50.120 --> 21:52.000]  point up just a little tiny bit.
[21:52.240 --> 21:56.120]  So that's the phenotype that I really like to smoke and really like to grow.
[21:56.280 --> 21:59.600]  That's the one that tests high. That's the one that Organica tested high with.
[21:59.600 --> 22:00.880]  That's the one we tested high with.
[22:01.120 --> 22:03.080]  That's the one that makes all the good concentrates.
[22:03.200 --> 22:06.320]  So that is the one that you want. That's the 50 50 phenotype.
[22:06.320 --> 22:09.360]  That's the one to go for. That's the one you see me posting pictures of.
[22:09.560 --> 22:13.120]  So let's talk about number six, the one I call the stretcher. I know you would,
[22:13.120 --> 22:16.120]  hope I call it the stretcher because it makes you want to call an ambulance,
[22:16.720 --> 22:19.960]  but that's not it. This phenotype is super easy to identify.
[22:19.960 --> 22:22.080]  It's taller than every plant in the fucking grow room.
[22:22.320 --> 22:25.680]  This plant is what I call the non-desirable phenotype. I'll admit it.
[22:25.680 --> 22:27.520]  There's one that sucks. Throw it away.
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.680]  She stays skinny and produces long, skinny leaves, really long,
[22:31.680 --> 22:34.680]  really skinny leaves. I think that's the Hawaiian sativa doing that.
[22:35.240 --> 22:38.680]  The buds that come from this phenotype are coated in trichomes and the high is
[22:38.680 --> 22:41.440]  straight to your head. It'll make your eyes bright red.
[22:41.440 --> 22:44.360]  It'll make your eyes squinty and you won't be able to find your keys while
[22:44.360 --> 22:47.480]  they're in your hand. You'll lose your sunglasses while you're wearing them.
[22:47.520 --> 22:52.440]  But the problem with the stretcher is that she will triple in size in the first
[22:52.480 --> 22:56.720]  three or four weeks of flower. And she takes like 10 full weeks,
[22:56.720 --> 22:58.560]  maybe 11 or 12 full weeks to flower,
[22:58.580 --> 23:01.520]  depending on the phenotype that you find out of that one.
[23:02.080 --> 23:04.240]  If you've got high ceilings and a lot of time to experiment,
[23:04.840 --> 23:05.900]  it's got a lot of potential,
[23:05.900 --> 23:09.520]  but I would rather just cut her down and grow some of the other phenotypes that
[23:09.520 --> 23:10.680]  pop up. So I will admit it.
[23:10.960 --> 23:13.240]  There's a phenotype in there that you might want to get rid of.
[23:13.280 --> 23:15.320]  The sativa high that comes from that thing,
[23:15.320 --> 23:19.080]  the amount of trichomes that fall off of it are amazing and impressive,
[23:19.360 --> 23:21.680]  but it's such a pain in the ass to grow that it's not even worth it.
[23:21.680 --> 23:24.680]  So that's the one I call the stretcher. It takes off, it gets super tall.
[23:24.680 --> 23:29.120]  It stays super skinny. It basically grows one long skinny switch.
[23:29.720 --> 23:31.920]  It's not the one to keep. So if you got that one popping up,
[23:31.940 --> 23:35.880]  maybe get rid of her early, but don't confuse it for the sativa dominant phenotype.
[23:35.880 --> 23:39.200]  If you see a lot of branching, that's the sativa. If you don't see branching,
[23:39.320 --> 23:41.960]  that's the girl I call the stretcher. Go ahead and cut her down,
[23:42.120 --> 23:42.940]  get her out of there.
[23:43.700 --> 23:47.220]  So those are basically the six phenotypes to expect.
[23:47.460 --> 23:52.220]  You should expect variation. These are F1s. This is nature. It's what's expected.
[23:52.240 --> 23:54.860]  That's how shit works until I release the F3s or F4s,
[23:54.880 --> 23:56.980]  which I will announce and label the packages accordingly.
[23:57.220 --> 24:01.260]  Expect the variation from the Arise. I appreciate variation and enjoy it.
[24:01.500 --> 24:03.940]  That's part of the fun from growing from seed. Now,
[24:03.940 --> 24:05.020]  if you're going to grow Arise,
[24:05.380 --> 24:09.340]  I would suggest you grow 63 to 70 days for each phenotype.
[24:09.340 --> 24:10.300]  If it's your first time,
[24:10.540 --> 24:14.860]  if you've got 77 days and you think it may need it, give it that. Don't be shy.
[24:15.100 --> 24:17.860]  63 to 70 days, maybe 77 if needed,
[24:17.860 --> 24:20.540]  and see what they do and adjust from there the next time.
[24:20.560 --> 24:25.300]  Don't forget that a phenohunt is the start of dialing in a long-term relationship
[24:25.300 --> 24:26.860]  with a selected phenotype.
[24:27.500 --> 24:30.500]  You're not just trying to get this one dialed in the first time.
[24:30.520 --> 24:33.300]  You're going to have to date her a couple of times before you do it right.
[24:33.340 --> 24:35.780]  That's how it goes. Let's see.
[24:35.780 --> 24:39.540]  Most of the phenotypes are going to give you generous yields and the potency on
[24:39.540 --> 24:44.500]  Arise is always impressive. So any phenotype you pull out will be covered in
[24:44.500 --> 24:48.220]  trichomes. It'll be highly potent. It will be very desirable medicine.
[24:49.220 --> 24:52.380]  Arise is very fast to veg and she loves lots of light.
[24:52.420 --> 24:54.060]  Give her as much light as you can.
[24:54.180 --> 24:58.220]  Arise also grows quickly in flower and you will need some sort of support in
[24:58.240 --> 25:00.540]  early flower. She's going to get tall and heavy on you.
[25:00.540 --> 25:04.500]  Those buds are going to get fat. She likes to produce big buds.
[25:04.500 --> 25:07.700]  So be prepared, have some sticks or trellising or tomato cages.
[25:08.100 --> 25:10.740]  I like to crack and pop the stems. You guys, I talk about it a lot.
[25:10.860 --> 25:12.820]  Super cropping start at the bottom of the plant,
[25:13.180 --> 25:15.660]  grab the plant with your fist, grab the plant with the other fist.
[25:15.660 --> 25:17.220]  Remember when you did the thing in baseball,
[25:17.420 --> 25:19.300]  you'd go up the bat and see who gets to bat first.
[25:19.300 --> 25:20.460]  I don't know if you guys all did that,
[25:20.780 --> 25:23.860]  but you put one hand one hand above the other and just twist them opposite
[25:23.860 --> 25:27.460]  directions. And the stem is going to go, just going to make a little pop noise.
[25:27.740 --> 25:31.100]  That's fine. You don't want to crush and destroy the plant. You want it to pop.
[25:31.100 --> 25:34.620]  You are breaking the cellulose in the plant and it's going to get stronger
[25:34.620 --> 25:37.980]  because of that. It's also going to slow down the stretching.
[25:38.220 --> 25:39.220]  So I like to pop them.
[25:39.220 --> 25:43.300]  I like to twist them that always helps me slow down the stretch.
[25:43.380 --> 25:47.020]  And it also makes the stock stronger to support the upcoming bud sets because
[25:47.040 --> 25:50.180]  Arise is going to have some beefy buds. Get a headstart on that.
[25:50.700 --> 25:54.300]  Arise also has a very nice array of flavors and aromas.
[25:54.420 --> 25:58.660]  I would recommend a carbon filter. You're going to need carbon filtration.
[25:58.980 --> 26:03.340]  Even the sweet like golden goat candy smelling phenotypes will get attention.
[26:03.340 --> 26:05.860]  People are going to be like, what is that smell? It's got a hint of skunk.
[26:05.860 --> 26:06.860]  It's got a hint of funk.
[26:07.140 --> 26:09.260]  And then there's this candy and ice cream smell going on.
[26:09.260 --> 26:11.740]  Your neighbors are going to notice that somebody's going to want to know what's
[26:11.740 --> 26:12.580]  going on.
[26:12.820 --> 26:17.200]  Somebody got raided here in our area recently because the neighbors reported the
[26:17.200 --> 26:20.620]  smell of marijuana. So the police went there, knocked on the door.
[26:20.660 --> 26:21.920]  The guy gave shitty answers.
[26:21.920 --> 26:25.380]  The police came back and took everything because he had too much. It was illegal,
[26:25.460 --> 26:27.380]  but that aroma is what got him in trouble.
[26:27.380 --> 26:31.260]  So you guys take care of your aromas if you're growing legally or illegally
[26:31.260 --> 26:35.140]  because it's legal here and they still call the police on him for the aroma.
[26:35.220 --> 26:39.580]  So pay attention to that. Carbon filters are a must. Let's see, where am I?
[26:39.940 --> 26:44.820]  Um, let's see. Arise can handle heavy feedings. She likes a lot of nutrients.
[26:44.820 --> 26:48.220]  She can handle snapping and popping and she takes stress training well.
[26:48.460 --> 26:50.220]  She can also handle problems pretty well.
[26:50.220 --> 26:54.020]  We had a technical issue in a grow where an air conditioner went out and Arise
[26:54.020 --> 26:56.900]  just kept growing. Everybody else was pissed off.
[26:57.100 --> 27:00.380]  We had another room where the auto water did not turn off one time.
[27:00.460 --> 27:04.380]  Every plant got way too much water because the auto, the shutoff switch didn't,
[27:04.380 --> 27:07.940]  it, anyway, they got too much water. That Arise plant loved it.
[27:07.940 --> 27:11.740]  Everybody else wanted to fucking die. So Arise can take a lot of stress.
[27:11.740 --> 27:14.780]  We have beat the shit out of her in several different environments and she seems
[27:14.940 --> 27:19.100]  to love it. Uh, she does well in high heat and humidity.
[27:19.740 --> 27:24.180]  Some phenotypes of Arise, you'll notice they have huge fan leaves.
[27:25.180 --> 27:29.180]  That's okay. That's a trait from Daybreaker. Those traits,
[27:29.180 --> 27:31.860]  those leaves will hang down. That's okay.
[27:31.860 --> 27:36.340]  I encourage you to remove the excess leaves that are really big to allow light
[27:36.380 --> 27:38.740]  and air to get to your plants and your buds.
[27:39.580 --> 27:42.940]  Those larger leaf phenotypes will look droopy sometimes for no reason.
[27:43.100 --> 27:45.220]  Like I said earlier, that's a trait from Daybreaker.
[27:46.420 --> 27:49.660]  I've seen it in several crosses that I've made from the Arise male.
[27:49.660 --> 27:50.620]  It's not a problem.
[27:50.620 --> 27:53.540]  The leaves are just so big that they droop a little bit all the time.
[27:53.540 --> 27:56.180]  The plant can't hold those big ass leaves up. They're not thirsty.
[27:56.180 --> 27:59.780]  They're not having problems. It just makes huge leaves.
[27:59.980 --> 28:04.220]  Those phenotypes are very OG dominant and the ones with the big leaves that hang
[28:04.220 --> 28:08.980]  down a lot usually produced that cushy, chemmy aroma that I was enjoying.
[28:10.180 --> 28:13.940]  One thing I should warn you about Arise is to not let it become root bound.
[28:13.980 --> 28:18.020]  The roots grow as quickly as the plant above the dirt. So keep that in mind.
[28:18.300 --> 28:22.460]  She is growing just as fast inside that pot. So pay attention.
[28:22.500 --> 28:27.020]  A root bound plant will trick you into thinking it has other issues like pH or
[28:27.020 --> 28:31.020]  CalMag problems. Pay attention to your container size and plan ahead.
[28:31.020 --> 28:33.700]  This plant's going to take eight to 10 weeks to flower.
[28:33.940 --> 28:36.180]  Make sure you have the proper pot size.
[28:36.180 --> 28:39.660]  Make sure you flower on time so you don't overload your pot.
[28:39.940 --> 28:44.100]  Also I'd recommend using an air pot so that if the plant does get too big,
[28:44.300 --> 28:46.740]  it'll kind of feel that air out there and it'll kind of prune itself.
[28:46.740 --> 28:51.580]  That will help you out. My best results personally with the Arise have come from
[28:51.620 --> 28:55.740]  air pots with cocoa using veg bloom nutrients and a few additives.
[28:55.740 --> 28:57.460]  Those additives were from New Millennium.
[28:57.940 --> 29:01.660]  I'd recommend Shine at the last week of veg and into flower.
[29:01.980 --> 29:04.660]  When you're leaving veg, add the Shine at that point in time,
[29:04.660 --> 29:06.500]  the last week of veg and starting flower,
[29:06.660 --> 29:10.900]  put Shine in there and that will help reduce the stretch at early flower that
[29:10.900 --> 29:14.340]  will slow down that Arise stretch because they do like to take off on you.
[29:14.340 --> 29:15.620]  You guys be prepared for that.
[29:16.220 --> 29:18.660]  Now let's talk a little bit about smoking Arise.
[29:18.660 --> 29:21.660]  We've talked a long time about growing. We've talked about the phenotypes.
[29:21.900 --> 29:24.940]  Let's talk about smoking on some Arise.
[29:25.300 --> 29:29.220]  Some people have reported that Arise is the perfect nighttime medicine to relax
[29:29.220 --> 29:30.340]  them at the end of the day.
[29:30.900 --> 29:34.740]  Other people report that Arise is the perfect high energy daytime smoke.
[29:34.780 --> 29:39.780]  Now the funny thing is both of those reports came from the same batch of Arise.
[29:40.100 --> 29:43.900]  They were buying the same product and people were having completely different
[29:43.900 --> 29:44.740]  reactions.
[29:44.980 --> 29:47.940]  That's because it's such a balanced phenotype that it's just working for
[29:47.940 --> 29:50.780]  everybody in a different way. We all have different body chemistry.
[29:51.540 --> 29:53.540]  I like Arise as my recreational smoke.
[29:53.580 --> 29:57.740]  It gives me a really good head high and it makes me social and creative.
[29:57.900 --> 30:01.260]  It makes me talkative. It makes me like to play music. And honestly,
[30:01.500 --> 30:04.100]  it makes me just forget about any stress or anything like that.
[30:04.100 --> 30:06.060]  It kind of just puts all that shit to the back of my mind.
[30:06.060 --> 30:07.940]  It's kind of just like stress reliever dabs.
[30:08.100 --> 30:12.100]  So I like to smoke Arise when I play music or when I'm writing podcast episodes
[30:12.100 --> 30:14.340]  or when I have to go somewhere and I don't,
[30:14.340 --> 30:17.300]  if you're not in the mood to be social and you got to go talk to damn people and
[30:17.300 --> 30:18.740]  you're not feeling it, smoke some Arise.
[30:18.740 --> 30:20.900]  You'll get there and you just won't shut the fuck up. You're just like, Hey,
[30:20.900 --> 30:24.220]  I'm here guys. It's good to see everybody. That's what Arise does to me.
[30:24.860 --> 30:28.460]  Medical patients have reported that Arise helps with their headaches.
[30:28.580 --> 30:32.380]  A lot of people have said it helps with depression and PTSD symptoms.
[30:32.700 --> 30:36.620]  I know it helps with migraines. I know it will help with appetite.
[30:36.620 --> 30:40.580]  If you're not eating, you can smoke some Arise and it will make you hungry.
[30:41.020 --> 30:43.780]  The Indica part of Arise will work if you've got pain,
[30:43.780 --> 30:46.460]  it'll chill out all of your body pain. If you've got some aches and pains,
[30:46.780 --> 30:48.460]  I think Arise would be great for that.
[30:48.820 --> 30:52.300]  I could also see it working as sort of an antidepressant because it's got such
[30:52.300 --> 30:56.700]  an uplifting positive high, which is kind of why I called it Arise.
[30:56.740 --> 31:00.140]  It makes me want to wake up part of my brain that just doesn't seem to want to
[31:00.140 --> 31:02.540]  wake up sometimes. That lazy part that you're like, meh,
[31:02.780 --> 31:06.500]  it just puts another vibration in there and it makes your brain Arise.
[31:06.500 --> 31:07.580]  So that's why I called it that.
[31:07.940 --> 31:11.500]  Also you'll notice a lot of the things that I bred from Daybreaker have a one
[31:11.520 --> 31:14.860]  word name like cascade and Arise and firefly.
[31:15.180 --> 31:18.900]  I was kind of trying to honor Gage Green genetics since that Daybreaker came from
[31:18.900 --> 31:19.500]  Gage.
[31:19.500 --> 31:24.300]  They like to use one word inspirational type words to name their strains and I
[31:24.300 --> 31:28.100]  was trying to keep with that vibe and I thought Arise was beautiful. Cascade,
[31:28.100 --> 31:30.380]  firefly, things like that that came from the Daybreaker.
[31:30.780 --> 31:33.620]  We'll have those sorts of names. That's where the naming scheme comes from.
[31:33.820 --> 31:37.260]  Kind of just trying to do some honor to Gage Green genetics.
[31:37.900 --> 31:42.020]  And the name Arise actually may have been mentioned by somebody on social media.
[31:42.020 --> 31:44.620]  I was trying to name something else and they said, how about Arise?
[31:44.620 --> 31:46.220]  And I was like, that's not the name for this cross,
[31:46.220 --> 31:48.700]  but that is certainly something for the future. And I wrote it down.
[31:49.060 --> 31:51.580]  And then when this one came up, I was like, that's where this goes.
[31:51.780 --> 31:54.900]  So sometimes those strain names just get written down and they get saved for the
[31:54.900 --> 31:57.140]  right time. And that's what happened here with this one.
[31:57.220 --> 31:59.940]  I'm pretty sure that's how it went. All right, you guys,
[31:59.940 --> 32:04.260]  that is my strain report on Arise. I appreciate you for listening to that.
[32:04.460 --> 32:06.260]  If you're interested in Arise seeds,
[32:06.380 --> 32:10.660]  I recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[32:10.860 --> 32:14.340]  This episode comes out just in time for the 4th of July sale.

[32:52.220 --> 32:55.460]  I'd love to see what you're doing with Arise or any of my genetics.
[32:55.660 --> 32:58.780]  If you're doing a great job, maybe I'll send you more seeds to work with.
[32:59.460 --> 33:02.100]  All right, you guys, that was my report on Arise.
[33:02.260 --> 33:03.940]  There's only one more thing I want to ask of you.
[33:04.420 --> 33:06.500]  I want to get Arise on Leafly.
[33:07.020 --> 33:09.980]  Leafly is a website that recommends strains and highlights strains.
[33:10.220 --> 33:13.180]  A lot of people that need information on shopping at a dispensary will go to
[33:13.180 --> 33:15.500]  Leafly and try to find a strain that works for them.
[33:16.220 --> 33:18.020]  Let's get Arise on Leafly.
[33:18.060 --> 33:20.220]  The only way we can do that is to create an account.
[33:20.460 --> 33:23.660]  There's a little tab that says add a strain. You have to leave a strain review.
[33:23.900 --> 33:26.940]  If you have ever grown, smoked, consumed, smelled, or seen Arise,
[33:27.060 --> 33:28.740]  you're qualified to go leave a review there.
[33:29.060 --> 33:32.340]  Go talk about Arise on Leafly and eventually they will add it.
[33:32.620 --> 33:36.180]  We currently have Lemon Jeffrey on Leafly and my Capleton is on Leafly.
[33:36.660 --> 33:41.020]  I would love to see my Arise featured on Leafly. That would make me proud.
[33:41.140 --> 33:42.780]  So if you guys could help me out with that,
[33:42.900 --> 33:45.660]  I would appreciate that support. Ladies and gentlemen,
[33:45.660 --> 33:47.940]  I want to thank you for listening to a long podcast.
[33:47.940 --> 33:50.180]  I had a really good time talking about my strain.
[33:50.380 --> 33:52.460]  It feels a little egotistical writing the episodes,
[33:52.460 --> 33:55.100]  but once we get down to it, it sounds like you guys enjoy it.
[33:55.100 --> 33:57.380]  So thanks for the support. Thanks for the encouragement.
[33:57.580 --> 33:58.700]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[33:58.900 --> 34:01.180]  I would appreciate it if you find me on all of the social media.
