[00:00.000 --> 00:02.240]  All right, welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.240 --> 00:06.720]  It is time for episode 456 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast, a quick Thursday episode
[00:06.720 --> 00:07.720]  for you.
[00:07.720 --> 00:11.080]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:11.080 --> 00:15.440]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:15.440 --> 00:19.840]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:19.840 --> 00:26.840]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:26.840 --> 00:31.180]  Today I've been taking dabs of Double OG full spectrum extract from our friends at
[00:31.180 --> 00:32.460]  Green Dot Labs.
[00:32.460 --> 00:35.940]  This is a blend of Legend OG and Sour Double.
[00:35.940 --> 00:39.860]  On the package, the flavor is described as pine, sour, and lemon.
[00:39.860 --> 00:42.640]  I would absolutely agree with all of those flavors.
[00:42.640 --> 00:44.840]  There is certainly a piney-ness on the inhale.
[00:44.840 --> 00:48.540]  There's a sourness on the exhale, and the lemon kind of lingers on the tongue.
[00:48.540 --> 00:54.520]  There's also a very gassy aroma that lingers in the room when you smoke the Sour Double.
[00:54.520 --> 01:00.240]  The potency label says that this product contains 74.73% THC.
[01:00.240 --> 01:01.720]  I really love this concentrate.
[01:01.720 --> 01:06.640]  I picked up a four gram jar, and it lasted two and a half days.
[01:06.640 --> 01:11.880]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Double OG full spectrum
[01:11.880 --> 01:12.880]  extract.
[01:12.880 --> 01:16.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers, in this episode I'm going to
[01:16.580 --> 01:20.480]  read a couple of emails, but before we get there, I would like to do a shout out to a
[01:20.480 --> 01:23.000]  few of our friends from Patreon.
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.200]  I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and thank you to my friend
[01:27.200 --> 01:28.600]  BakedPWN.
[01:28.600 --> 01:31.680]  I want to send a giant shout out and thank you to my friend Tyler.
[01:31.680 --> 01:36.120]  How about a big, giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and thank you to Mike F.
[01:36.120 --> 01:38.600]  Of course another giant shout out to our buddy Mike.
[01:38.600 --> 01:41.000]  How about a big, giant shout out to Dustin P.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.040]  Of course a giant Grow from Your Heart podcast shout out and thank you to Darren W.
[01:45.040 --> 01:46.860]  Of course a shout out to Baz.
[01:46.860 --> 01:51.140]  And last but certainly not least, holding it down out there, I want to give a giant
[01:51.140 --> 01:53.820]  Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a fist bump
[01:53.820 --> 01:55.820]  to our buddy Farmer John.
[01:55.820 --> 01:57.260]  I wanna thank each and every one of you
[01:57.260 --> 01:59.460]  for the continued Patreon support.
[01:59.460 --> 02:01.160]  If you would like to learn how to support the show
[02:01.160 --> 02:03.580]  on Patreon, you can do so by going to
[02:03.580 --> 02:08.580]  www.patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[02:08.660 --> 02:10.140]  All of the information you need
[02:10.140 --> 02:11.820]  will be right there on the screen.
[02:11.820 --> 02:13.460]  And once again, I wanna send a huge thank you
[02:13.460 --> 02:15.420]  to everybody who has supported the show
[02:15.420 --> 02:18.100]  in the past, in the present, and in the future.
[02:18.100 --> 02:20.900]  Your continued support does mean a lot to me.
[02:20.900 --> 02:24.020]  That support keeps this podcast free for everybody.
[02:24.020 --> 02:26.580]  I've put out over 450 episodes.
[02:26.580 --> 02:29.180]  I've never charged a penny for any of my content.
[02:29.180 --> 02:32.800]  The Patreon is what allows me to produce free content.
[02:32.800 --> 02:35.260]  That Patreon covers the cost of my computer.
[02:35.260 --> 02:36.940]  That Patreon covers the cost
[02:36.940 --> 02:38.500]  of my internet connection every month.
[02:38.500 --> 02:40.760]  My internet connection is expensive here.
[02:40.760 --> 02:43.300]  That Patreon covers things like microphone cover
[02:43.300 --> 02:44.760]  so that when Mike comes over,
[02:44.760 --> 02:46.540]  him and whatever guest has been over before,
[02:46.540 --> 02:48.420]  they don't have to share the same microphone cover
[02:48.420 --> 02:49.980]  because that's a little bit funky.
[02:49.980 --> 02:51.140]  It goes for things like that.
[02:51.140 --> 02:52.740]  So big shout out to everybody
[02:52.740 --> 02:54.420]  who supports the show on Patreon.
[02:54.420 --> 02:55.240]  Thank you.
[02:55.240 --> 02:57.980]  I appreciate it and it makes the show possible.
[02:57.980 --> 03:01.220]  I feel like I just did an NPR sales drive or something.
[03:01.220 --> 03:03.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, without your donations,
[03:03.180 --> 03:04.740]  NPR wouldn't be here.
[03:04.740 --> 03:05.980]  It's not like that, you guys.
[03:05.980 --> 03:08.300]  Without the Patreon, I would still do the podcast.
[03:08.300 --> 03:10.660]  I just wanna make sure that the people who contribute
[03:10.660 --> 03:11.860]  know that I appreciate it.
[03:11.860 --> 03:13.300]  So big thanks to everybody.
[03:13.300 --> 03:16.140]  Now let's talk about the next order of business.
[03:16.140 --> 03:18.260]  Have you joined the new cannabis-friendly
[03:18.260 --> 03:20.620]  social media app known as Cannabuzz?
[03:20.620 --> 03:23.260]  Cannabuzz is a free app that is available
[03:23.260 --> 03:25.180]  on your Apple or Android device.
[03:25.180 --> 03:27.820]  All you have to do is go to your app store and download it.
[03:27.820 --> 03:29.940]  And it is a lot like some of our favorite
[03:29.940 --> 03:34.940]  social media applications, but it is very cannabis-friendly.
[03:35.020 --> 03:38.360]  We cannot buy, sell, or trade cannabis on Cannabuzz,
[03:38.360 --> 03:40.300]  but we do encourage and promote you
[03:40.300 --> 03:43.480]  to post your cannabis-related content.
[03:43.480 --> 03:46.820]  Post your ganja photos, post your weed plant photos,
[03:46.820 --> 03:50.060]  post your bud photos, post your concentrate photos,
[03:50.060 --> 03:54.620]  post your dab videos, post any cannabis-related content
[03:54.620 --> 03:56.660]  you have got on Cannabuzz.

[04:03.020 --> 04:04.060]  We've got a lot of friends.
[04:04.060 --> 04:06.720]  I have got a lot of people following my feed.
[04:06.720 --> 04:08.420]  I think you would enjoy Cannabuzz.
[04:08.420 --> 04:10.540]  If you like this podcast, you're gonna love Cannabuzz.

[04:20.700 --> 04:24.140]  Also get a chance to win a free Irie Genetics t-shirt
[04:24.140 --> 04:26.020]  or other prize packages.
[04:26.020 --> 04:29.000]  I do a lot of giveaways and contests on Cannabuzz.
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.220]  So don't miss out.
[04:30.220 --> 04:31.460]  Join me on Cannabuzz.
[04:31.460 --> 04:33.820]  It is free and it is a great community.
[04:33.820 --> 04:35.620]  Another thing I should mention about Cannabuzz
[04:35.620 --> 04:38.980]  is we recently added an Irie Genetics group.
[04:38.980 --> 04:39.800]  That's right.
[04:39.800 --> 04:41.780]  If you are growing or interested in growing
[04:41.780 --> 04:44.420]  or interested in learning about Irie Genetics,
[04:44.420 --> 04:47.500]  there is a group dedicated to Irie Genetics
[04:47.500 --> 04:49.860]  on the Cannabuzz application.
[04:49.860 --> 04:50.880]  The app is new.
[04:50.880 --> 04:52.780]  It may be hard for some people to navigate.
[04:52.780 --> 04:54.580]  I'm going to walk us right through it.
[04:54.580 --> 04:56.740]  All you've got to do is open the Cannabuzz app.
[04:56.740 --> 04:57.740]  Then on the bottom,
[04:57.740 --> 05:00.780]  there is a little magnifying glass type icon.
[05:00.780 --> 05:02.100]  You're probably familiar with that.
[05:02.100 --> 05:03.480]  Click on that one.
[05:03.480 --> 05:06.340]  Then there is a, I know this is a lot of steps already.
[05:06.340 --> 05:07.700]  At the top, there's a search bar.
[05:07.700 --> 05:08.840]  If you click on that search bar,
[05:08.840 --> 05:10.700]  it will bring up the groups.
[05:10.700 --> 05:13.180]  When you click on that group, scroll down.
[05:13.180 --> 05:14.260]  When you click on the group tab,
[05:14.260 --> 05:16.220]  scroll down and you will see Irie Genetics.
[05:16.220 --> 05:17.620]  They're in alphabetical order.
[05:17.620 --> 05:19.460]  Click on there, join the group.
[05:19.460 --> 05:21.640]  At this time, it has got 47 members.
[05:21.640 --> 05:22.660]  It is a brand new group.
[05:22.660 --> 05:25.280]  There are a lot of great photos in here.
[05:25.280 --> 05:28.660]  I encourage you to join the group and post some photos.
[05:28.660 --> 05:30.960]  If you've got any questions about Irie Genetics,
[05:30.960 --> 05:32.620]  that is a great place to ask them.
[05:32.620 --> 05:34.980]  There is a great community there ready to help you.
[05:34.980 --> 05:36.540]  I am there quite frequently,
[05:36.540 --> 05:39.620]  and the Irie Army is there all the time to have your back.
[05:39.660 --> 05:43.780]  So join us on Cannabuzz and join the Irie Genetics group.
[05:43.780 --> 05:46.040]  All right, that's enough talking about Cannabuzz, you guys.
[05:46.040 --> 05:47.660]  Let's get into an email.
[05:47.660 --> 05:49.460]  A lot of people send me great emails.
[05:49.460 --> 05:51.340]  They've got a lot of wonderful grow questions.
[05:51.340 --> 05:52.740]  They need help in their garden.
[05:52.740 --> 05:55.300]  I have got a stack of emails, two feet tall.
[05:55.300 --> 05:57.000]  So let's not waste too much time.
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.980]  Let's help some folks out.
[05:58.980 --> 06:01.060]  I know I said I've got a stack of emails in front of me,
[06:01.060 --> 06:03.180]  but if anybody out there has a grow question
[06:03.180 --> 06:04.780]  and you would like some help on the show,
[06:04.780 --> 06:06.340]  maybe you've just got something you'd like to say,
[06:06.340 --> 06:07.340]  you can send me an email.
[06:07.340 --> 06:11.140]  My email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[06:11.140 --> 06:12.420]  I would love to hear from you.
[06:12.420 --> 06:14.540]  Let's jump right into this first email.
[06:14.540 --> 06:17.260]  This is from someone who calls themselves St. Stephen.
[06:17.260 --> 06:18.820]  Hey, brother, good to hear from you.
[06:18.820 --> 06:22.620]  The email from our friend St. Stephen goes just like this.
[06:22.620 --> 06:24.100]  Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[06:24.100 --> 06:26.560]  First off, I have purchased two humidity
[06:26.560 --> 06:28.100]  and temperature monitors.
[06:28.100 --> 06:31.420]  They are both giving me wildly different readings.
[06:31.420 --> 06:33.900]  I would like my information about temperature and humidity
[06:33.900 --> 06:35.580]  to be as accurate as possible,
[06:35.580 --> 06:38.660]  both inside and outside my tents.
[06:38.660 --> 06:41.400]  Are there any temperature and humidity monitors
[06:41.400 --> 06:43.060]  which you would recommend?
[06:43.060 --> 06:45.020]  There are a couple I will recommend,
[06:45.020 --> 06:45.880]  but before we get there,
[06:45.880 --> 06:48.540]  I am kind of curious about your experiment
[06:48.540 --> 06:49.380]  that you have done here.
[06:49.380 --> 06:52.660]  You bought two temperature and humidity monitors.
[06:52.660 --> 06:54.980]  Those are hygrometers, I think we call those,
[06:54.980 --> 06:56.980]  and they are giving you wildly different readings.
[06:56.980 --> 06:59.780]  I want to know if you bought two of the same kind.
[06:59.780 --> 07:01.100]  Are they the same thing?
[07:01.100 --> 07:04.060]  Did you buy two different hygrometers?
[07:04.060 --> 07:06.540]  Did you buy one at one time and one at another?
[07:06.540 --> 07:07.980]  Is one battery operated?
[07:07.980 --> 07:09.800]  Is one, I don't know what the other one works,
[07:09.800 --> 07:12.260]  is the battery dead on one is what I'm getting at.
[07:12.260 --> 07:13.560]  So are they the same kind?
[07:13.560 --> 07:16.120]  Are they the same quality?
[07:16.120 --> 07:18.900]  Then my next question is, are they in the same place?
[07:18.900 --> 07:22.300]  How far apart are they in your area?
[07:22.300 --> 07:24.060]  It is very common in a grow space
[07:24.060 --> 07:25.880]  to have wildly different readings,
[07:25.880 --> 07:29.220]  just a few feet apart from each other in a grow environment.
[07:29.220 --> 07:30.940]  Imagine if I'm up here by the light,
[07:30.940 --> 07:32.780]  six or eight feet up high in the room,
[07:32.780 --> 07:35.260]  and I come down just directly straight down,
[07:35.260 --> 07:38.660]  go three feet down, it's going to be drastically cooler
[07:38.660 --> 07:41.900]  just a few feet down if we don't have appropriate airflow.
[07:41.900 --> 07:44.120]  Then imagine if you move off three feet to the left,
[07:44.120 --> 07:45.580]  it's going to get much cooler.
[07:45.580 --> 07:48.120]  So you're going to get drastically different readings
[07:48.120 --> 07:50.080]  throughout the room, possibly.
[07:50.080 --> 07:52.500]  You may have microclimates based on the size of the room.
[07:52.500 --> 07:55.780]  You may have 90 degree sections and 78 degree sections
[07:55.780 --> 07:57.280]  based on the size of the room
[07:57.280 --> 07:59.880]  and the efficiency of your airflow equipment.
[07:59.880 --> 08:01.380]  So my first investigation is
[08:01.380 --> 08:03.600]  what kind of hygrometers are we using?
[08:03.600 --> 08:05.000]  Are they the same thing?
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.320]  Are they the same quality?
[08:06.320 --> 08:08.280]  Because if we're using different monitors
[08:08.280 --> 08:09.680]  and we're getting different results,
[08:09.680 --> 08:11.440]  that experiment is a little bit invalid.
[08:11.440 --> 08:14.160]  We need three of the same or at least two of the same tools
[08:14.160 --> 08:17.980]  to do the same experiment to expect similar results.
[08:17.980 --> 08:20.840]  If you're using the same kind, this may sound crazy,
[08:20.840 --> 08:22.920]  but I would suggest buying a third
[08:22.920 --> 08:25.880]  and compare that third to those two.
[08:25.880 --> 08:28.800]  Maybe get a more expensive model.
[08:28.800 --> 08:30.280]  That's what you came to me for.
[08:30.280 --> 08:33.040]  You're asking if there is something that I would recommend.
[08:33.040 --> 08:36.040]  Of course, I would recommend a PL Grow unit.
[08:36.040 --> 08:37.960]  They are very great monitors.
[08:37.960 --> 08:40.380]  They monitor your temperature, your humidity.
[08:40.380 --> 08:42.880]  You can water the temperature of your nutrient solution.
[08:42.880 --> 08:45.040]  If you've got a reservoir with water in there,
[08:45.040 --> 08:46.520]  there's a little probe that just measures
[08:46.520 --> 08:48.600]  that temperature at all times.
[08:48.600 --> 08:51.600]  It will do the calculations on your VPD for you.
[08:51.600 --> 08:54.560]  So you know what your vapor pressure deficit is in the room
[08:54.560 --> 08:56.700]  where the monitor is hung at all times.
[08:56.700 --> 08:58.400]  They are quite affordable.
[08:59.000 --> 09:00.280]  They are not expensive units at all.
[09:00.280 --> 09:02.320]  They are very easy to get ahold of.
[09:02.320 --> 09:04.440]  What I really like about the PL Grow unit
[09:04.440 --> 09:06.400]  is I can look at it on my phone.
[09:06.400 --> 09:08.900]  All I have to do is open my phone, go to a website.
[09:08.900 --> 09:10.960]  I've already got the tab saved in my favorites.
[09:10.960 --> 09:13.100]  It says PL Grow, click on there.
[09:13.100 --> 09:15.100]  Once I'm in, it just takes a couple of seconds
[09:15.100 --> 09:16.480]  to refresh the dashboard.
[09:16.480 --> 09:18.460]  And that shows me the temperature
[09:18.460 --> 09:20.420]  and the humidity in my room.
[09:20.420 --> 09:22.600]  I know immediately what is going on.
[09:22.600 --> 09:23.920]  I can tell if the lights are on.
[09:23.920 --> 09:25.040]  I can tell if the lights are off.
[09:25.040 --> 09:26.800]  I can tell if the air conditioner did
[09:26.800 --> 09:28.360]  or did not cycle on as needed.
[09:29.200 --> 09:30.560]  I can tell if the extraction fan to get rid
[09:30.560 --> 09:33.160]  of the humidity cycled off and on as needed.
[09:33.160 --> 09:37.160]  Also, I can set parameters in the PL Grow unit
[09:37.160 --> 09:39.760]  that will send me an email if something gets out
[09:39.760 --> 09:41.880]  of the parameters, which I set.
[09:41.880 --> 09:44.660]  So if I tell it, hey, when it's 87 degrees in here,
[09:44.660 --> 09:45.880]  send me an email.
[09:45.880 --> 09:48.320]  And when it hits 87 degrees, I get an email
[09:48.320 --> 09:49.320]  and it says, hey, Ross to Jeff,
[09:49.320 --> 09:51.580]  your PL Grow unit has detected
[09:51.580 --> 09:53.920]  that you are above desired temperatures.
[09:53.920 --> 09:56.160]  And then I can go, oh shit, I need to go to the grow.
[09:56.160 --> 09:57.700]  If I'm not where that grow is,
[09:58.060 --> 09:59.580]  I can drive to the grow, whichever grow it is.
[09:59.580 --> 10:01.260]  I've got these in multiple locations
[10:01.260 --> 10:02.500]  that I can log into and look.
[10:02.500 --> 10:05.100]  So I could say, how's the grow in Pueblo West?
[10:05.100 --> 10:06.100]  That one's doing good.
[10:06.100 --> 10:08.100]  How's the grow in Colorado Springs?
[10:08.100 --> 10:09.020]  That's doing good.
[10:09.020 --> 10:10.780]  And I can look at all of those grows
[10:10.780 --> 10:11.980]  while I'm chilling at lunch.
[10:11.980 --> 10:13.300]  And I don't have to go anywhere
[10:13.300 --> 10:15.260]  and I can monitor those conditions.
[10:15.260 --> 10:17.300]  So the first monitor I would recommend
[10:17.300 --> 10:18.660]  for your grow environment would be
[10:18.660 --> 10:21.700]  a PL Grow Systems Minder unit.
[10:21.700 --> 10:24.940]  You can find a PL Grow Systems Minder unit
[10:24.940 --> 10:27.780]  at PLGrow.Systems.
[10:27.780 --> 10:32.780]  Then while you're there, use coupon code GFYH25
[10:32.840 --> 10:35.900]  and you will get 25% off at checkout.
[10:35.900 --> 10:36.740]  What?
[10:36.740 --> 10:38.460]  25% off.
[10:38.460 --> 10:40.100]  That's a quarter of the price off.
[10:40.100 --> 10:43.300]  You're gonna pay 75% of the price for a Minder unit
[10:43.300 --> 10:46.540]  because you have got a Grow From Your Heart podcast coupon.
[10:46.540 --> 10:49.540]  Once again, that is PLGrow.Systems.
[10:49.540 --> 10:53.220]  The coupon code is GFYH25.
[10:53.260 --> 10:57.180]  That gets you 25% off at checkout.
[10:57.180 --> 10:59.540]  My friends at PL Grow were kind enough
[10:59.540 --> 11:01.580]  to send me a couple of Minder units
[11:01.580 --> 11:03.620]  to give to my listeners.
[11:03.620 --> 11:06.220]  So I am going to do something super kind here.
[11:06.220 --> 11:08.980]  St. Stephen, it sounds like you need some help.
[11:08.980 --> 11:11.900]  So as a gift from myself and PL Grow Systems,
[11:11.900 --> 11:14.220]  I would like to send you a Minder unit
[11:14.220 --> 11:16.180]  to put in your grow and find out
[11:16.180 --> 11:18.060]  what is happening in your grow room.
[11:18.060 --> 11:19.700]  We need to get that room dialed in
[11:19.700 --> 11:22.460]  and this is a perfect opportunity to help somebody out.
[11:22.460 --> 11:27.220]  So this podcast will come out on August 22nd.
[11:27.220 --> 11:30.140]  I'm going to give you until August 31st
[11:30.140 --> 11:33.100]  to send me an email and claim your prize.
[11:33.100 --> 11:34.780]  I know who sent me this original email
[11:34.780 --> 11:36.660]  so don't try to pull a fast one on me.
[11:36.660 --> 11:38.860]  Reply from the same email address
[11:38.860 --> 11:41.060]  and I will set you up with a brand new,
[11:41.060 --> 11:46.020]  free PL Grow Minder unit to put in your grow room.
[11:46.020 --> 11:49.180]  Once again, my friend St. Stephen who sent me this email,
[11:49.180 --> 11:50.180]  yes, this is real.
[11:50.220 --> 11:52.500]  You have got until August 31st
[11:52.500 --> 11:54.860]  to send me an email and claim your prize
[11:54.860 --> 11:58.780]  and I will be happy to send you a PL Grow Minder unit
[11:58.780 --> 12:00.340]  to play with in this grow room.
[12:00.340 --> 12:01.420]  It is yours to keep.
[12:01.420 --> 12:03.620]  I would just like some updates and some info
[12:03.620 --> 12:05.420]  on how well it works for you.
[12:05.420 --> 12:06.580]  How about that, ladies and gentlemen?
[12:06.580 --> 12:08.940]  A random giveaway in the middle of a podcast.
[12:08.940 --> 12:11.060]  Now there is more to this email we should cover.
[12:11.060 --> 12:13.060]  They also say, I would like my information
[12:13.060 --> 12:16.020]  about temperature and humidity to be as accurate as possible
[12:16.020 --> 12:19.420]  both inside and outside of my tents.
[12:19.460 --> 12:20.300]  I agree.
[12:20.300 --> 12:22.180]  So I'm wondering now if you are putting
[12:22.180 --> 12:25.700]  your two individual hygrometers and thermometers inside
[12:25.700 --> 12:27.980]  and one outside the tent and checking those readings
[12:27.980 --> 12:29.620]  and getting two wildly different readings
[12:29.620 --> 12:32.180]  or if those two thermometers are actually
[12:32.180 --> 12:33.300]  sitting next to each other
[12:33.300 --> 12:35.500]  and showing you wildly different readings.
[12:35.500 --> 12:36.980]  That's all right, we're gonna figure it out
[12:36.980 --> 12:39.940]  because you've got a Minder unit coming your way pretty soon.
[12:39.940 --> 12:41.780]  We'll get your room all dialed in.
[12:41.780 --> 12:43.260]  Once you get that Minder unit,
[12:43.260 --> 12:45.660]  you can find out what actually works,
[12:45.660 --> 12:48.540]  which thermometer hygrometer is working for you.
[12:48.540 --> 12:50.580]  You can place that one outside of the tent.
[12:50.580 --> 12:53.080]  You can put the PL Grow system inside of the tent.
[12:53.080 --> 12:54.260]  You should be all set up.
[12:54.260 --> 12:55.660]  If you like the PL Grow enough,
[12:55.660 --> 12:58.340]  you can get another one and put that outside of the tent.
[12:58.340 --> 12:59.660]  You can have it all dialed in
[12:59.660 --> 13:01.180]  and pay a lot of good attention.
[13:01.180 --> 13:03.180]  You're really gonna have a lot of fun with this.
[13:03.180 --> 13:05.860]  There is more to this email.
[13:05.860 --> 13:08.020]  Question number two, I am lucky to have
[13:08.020 --> 13:10.420]  central air conditioning coming through a vent
[13:10.420 --> 13:11.540]  into my grow room.
[13:11.540 --> 13:13.020]  That is very beneficial.
[13:13.020 --> 13:14.860]  It goes on to say, I have been struggling
[13:14.860 --> 13:17.540]  with heat problems due to the 2000 watt
[13:17.540 --> 13:21.220]  and 3000 watt LEDs that I am using.
[13:21.220 --> 13:23.260]  On top of that, my plants are in flower
[13:23.260 --> 13:26.500]  and are transpiring tons of moisture into the air.
[13:26.500 --> 13:29.540]  It's like gardening in a rainforest in here.
[13:29.540 --> 13:32.180]  I just added a duct fan to boost the airflow
[13:32.180 --> 13:33.620]  from the air conditioning vent
[13:33.620 --> 13:35.900]  and it's helping to cool the room down,
[13:35.900 --> 13:38.300]  but I still need to do more.
[13:38.300 --> 13:41.420]  My question is, should I have the cooler air
[13:41.420 --> 13:42.980]  blow directly into the tent
[13:43.020 --> 13:45.460]  via one of the lower openings in the tent,
[13:45.460 --> 13:49.580]  or should I cool the room outside of the tent?
[13:49.580 --> 13:51.180]  All right, we've got some great questions in here.
[13:51.180 --> 13:53.260]  We've got a lot of great information to work with.
[13:53.260 --> 13:54.340]  We have got a tent.
[13:54.340 --> 13:55.900]  It has got a lot of lighting in it,
[13:55.900 --> 13:58.420]  and it is in a small room that has central air.
[13:58.420 --> 13:59.820]  We're trying to cool the tent.
[13:59.820 --> 14:02.900]  It is getting hot because it is a super hot summer this year.
[14:02.900 --> 14:04.420]  Let's think about some of our options.
[14:04.420 --> 14:07.540]  The main question is, do I want to blow air
[14:07.540 --> 14:10.580]  directly into the tent via one of those lower openings,
[14:10.580 --> 14:14.860]  or should I cool the room in which the tent is in?
[14:14.860 --> 14:18.260]  Ideally, we would cool the room in which the tent is in,
[14:18.260 --> 14:19.860]  but that is going to be a struggle
[14:19.860 --> 14:21.900]  because you're probably venting the hot air
[14:21.900 --> 14:24.860]  out from the tent directly into that room.
[14:24.860 --> 14:26.580]  Then I don't know where it goes from there.
[14:26.580 --> 14:28.540]  If that hot air is trapped in that room,
[14:28.540 --> 14:30.540]  it's going to be hard to cool that entire room.
[14:30.540 --> 14:32.380]  If you're able to maybe open a door
[14:32.380 --> 14:33.620]  and get some air exchange
[14:33.620 --> 14:35.500]  where that hot air can get out of that room,
[14:35.500 --> 14:37.220]  travel through the rest of the house,
[14:37.220 --> 14:38.260]  that would be helpful.
[14:38.260 --> 14:40.140]  I understand if that is not an option.
[14:40.140 --> 14:42.580]  Sometimes we do need to keep the grow rooms contained.
[14:42.580 --> 14:45.700]  When you go opening that door, you expose odor,
[14:45.700 --> 14:48.660]  you expose noise, you expose the option of discovery,
[14:48.660 --> 14:51.700]  which may not be something you can open yourself up to.
[14:51.700 --> 14:55.860]  So you may need to run that ducting directly
[14:55.860 --> 14:59.900]  to that lower passive vent near the bottom of the tent.
[14:59.900 --> 15:03.380]  Now, depending on how cold that incoming air is,
[15:03.380 --> 15:06.180]  that's how I would judge how closely to the plants
[15:06.180 --> 15:07.980]  I put that incoming air.
[15:07.980 --> 15:10.660]  If it's really cold, I would back it off a little bit.
[15:10.660 --> 15:14.180]  If it's just nice, if it's like 78 degrees,
[15:14.180 --> 15:17.580]  you may allow that to blow directly right onto the plants.
[15:17.580 --> 15:20.060]  Think about any temperature of air
[15:20.060 --> 15:23.340]  blowing directly on you for too long will become annoying.
[15:23.340 --> 15:25.420]  I don't care if it is the perfect temperature,
[15:25.420 --> 15:27.260]  any air blowing constantly on you
[15:27.260 --> 15:31.140]  for a long duration of time eventually will become annoying.
[15:31.140 --> 15:33.700]  If you're a plant, it will happen more quickly.
[15:33.700 --> 15:34.980]  The plant can't move.
[15:34.980 --> 15:37.020]  The plant can't reach over and turn the fan off.
[15:37.020 --> 15:38.700]  That plant is stuck there.
[15:38.700 --> 15:42.100]  So if you've got a duct blowing on one section of plant,
[15:42.100 --> 15:44.980]  pay very close attention to that one plant.
[15:44.980 --> 15:48.580]  Your VPD in that section, your vapor pressure deficit
[15:48.580 --> 15:50.620]  is going to be highly disrupted
[15:50.620 --> 15:52.620]  because of that constant airflow,
[15:52.620 --> 15:56.340]  and you're introducing that cool air right to that one area.
[15:56.340 --> 15:57.220]  Now, if you do that,
[15:57.220 --> 16:01.300]  you do need more than one mix fan in that grow.
[16:01.300 --> 16:03.900]  You need to stir that fresh air in there
[16:03.900 --> 16:05.420]  and get that environment mixed up
[16:05.420 --> 16:08.420]  so we don't create, like I said earlier, microclimates.
[16:08.420 --> 16:12.020]  So if you do duct that duct right to the bottom there,
[16:12.020 --> 16:13.620]  feel how cold it is.
[16:13.620 --> 16:15.420]  Could you stand having that blowing on you
[16:15.420 --> 16:17.500]  24 hours a day at that temperature?
[16:17.500 --> 16:19.860]  If not, the plants don't want it either.
[16:19.860 --> 16:22.860]  If it's a good temperature, allow that to blow in the plants.
[16:22.860 --> 16:25.740]  You may be blowing this across the roots of the plants.
[16:25.740 --> 16:27.820]  They might be hitting right across the pot area.
[16:27.820 --> 16:30.620]  That won't be bad as long as it is not super cold.
[16:30.620 --> 16:32.980]  The lower area can tolerate a little cooler conditions.
[16:32.980 --> 16:33.820]  That's expected.
[16:33.820 --> 16:35.260]  It's shady down there.
[16:36.100 --> 16:37.540]  The plants should tolerate that quite well.
[16:37.540 --> 16:39.260]  Now, if you were blowing Arctic chill air,
[16:39.260 --> 16:41.740]  if it's fucking 68 degrees or lower in there,
[16:41.740 --> 16:43.900]  those plants may not be super happy about that.
[16:43.900 --> 16:45.060]  So pay attention,
[16:45.060 --> 16:48.340]  temperature of the air being delivered through that ducting.
[16:48.340 --> 16:51.340]  That is going to make all of the decisions for you.
[16:51.340 --> 16:52.340]  If it's super cold,
[16:52.340 --> 16:54.260]  you've got to back it off and cool the room,
[16:54.260 --> 16:55.700]  which is ideal anyway.
[16:55.700 --> 16:58.460]  In a large commercial horticulture environment,
[16:58.460 --> 17:00.100]  that is known as a lung room.
[17:00.100 --> 17:01.940]  It's more common to treat the room,
[17:01.940 --> 17:03.740]  get the temperature, the humidity,
[17:03.780 --> 17:05.660]  the CO2 levels correct in that room,
[17:05.660 --> 17:08.660]  then pipe that air into the actual grow space.
[17:08.660 --> 17:09.820]  It's easier that way.
[17:09.820 --> 17:11.940]  That's how it's done in other countries.
[17:11.940 --> 17:15.020]  That's how it's done in large flower production.
[17:15.020 --> 17:16.940]  That's how it's done in the Dutch production,
[17:16.940 --> 17:18.860]  where they do all the flower production.
[17:18.860 --> 17:20.580]  Most of the flowers that we have
[17:20.580 --> 17:23.260]  come from Dutch production facilities.
[17:23.260 --> 17:24.900]  They're shipped all around the world.
[17:24.900 --> 17:26.140]  In those facilities,
[17:26.140 --> 17:29.140]  they use a lung room type environment.
[17:29.140 --> 17:30.060]  In those facilities,
[17:30.060 --> 17:32.580]  they are also ridiculously clean,
[17:32.580 --> 17:33.940]  and it is very impressive.
[17:33.940 --> 17:35.580]  I wish American grow facilities
[17:35.580 --> 17:37.020]  would take some lessons from that,
[17:37.020 --> 17:39.820]  but I'm getting way off track now.
[17:39.820 --> 17:41.980]  Ideally, you would cool that entire room
[17:41.980 --> 17:43.660]  and pump that air into the tent.
[17:43.660 --> 17:45.860]  That air would just move in through the bottom vents.
[17:45.860 --> 17:48.300]  Hopefully you've got an extraction fan at the top,
[17:48.300 --> 17:50.300]  pulling out all of the heat and humidity.
[17:50.300 --> 17:52.300]  That will create just a normal airflow.
[17:52.300 --> 17:53.540]  The air will come in through the bottom.
[17:53.540 --> 17:54.660]  It'll pass up over the plants
[17:54.660 --> 17:56.140]  and go right out through the top.
[17:56.140 --> 17:57.580]  Naturally, heat rises,
[17:57.580 --> 18:00.180]  so that will help encourage the heat rise up to the top.
[18:00.180 --> 18:01.900]  Your humidity is going to go up to the top.
[18:01.900 --> 18:03.500]  Hopefully you've got a carbon filter in there,
[18:03.500 --> 18:05.580]  so you're sucking out the heat and humidity.
[18:05.580 --> 18:08.140]  Now, the key is that all of that stuff,
[18:08.140 --> 18:10.420]  that heat, the humidity, all of that air
[18:10.420 --> 18:12.140]  is going to be stuck in that room
[18:12.140 --> 18:13.900]  unless you've got somewhere for it to go.
[18:13.900 --> 18:16.780]  I don't know your exit strategy for that air.
[18:16.780 --> 18:19.700]  I don't know your plan to replenish that air.
[18:19.700 --> 18:21.380]  You need to get rid of that stale,
[18:21.380 --> 18:23.940]  stagnant CO2 depleted air
[18:23.940 --> 18:27.300]  and replace it with some fresh CO2 enriched oxygen
[18:27.300 --> 18:28.580]  that is the appropriate temperature
[18:28.580 --> 18:30.340]  and the appropriate humidity.
[18:30.340 --> 18:33.500]  The most common ways to do that are ducts in and ducts out.
[18:33.500 --> 18:35.420]  Most commonly, you've got a power duct out,
[18:35.420 --> 18:37.820]  sucking air out, and that naturally draws air in.
[18:37.820 --> 18:39.100]  It's all about displacement.
[18:39.100 --> 18:40.420]  It works on its own.
[18:40.420 --> 18:42.020]  That may not be an option for you.
[18:42.020 --> 18:43.220]  I understand that.
[18:43.220 --> 18:44.740]  What you may have to do,
[18:44.740 --> 18:47.780]  you said that it is very humid in your environment.
[18:47.780 --> 18:50.180]  You may need to add a dehumidifier.
[18:50.180 --> 18:52.660]  That will help you get the humidity down in that room.
[18:52.660 --> 18:55.740]  That'll make it feel much more comfortable for the plants.
[18:55.740 --> 18:58.380]  So if you're unable to add some sort of an extraction fan
[18:58.380 --> 19:01.460]  or a blower to remove that stale, stagnant air from the room
[19:01.460 --> 19:02.980]  or possibly open a door,
[19:02.980 --> 19:06.860]  you may want to consider adding a dehumidifier to your room.
[19:06.860 --> 19:08.340]  And again, with the dehumidifier,
[19:08.340 --> 19:11.100]  you've got the option of putting that directly in the tent
[19:11.100 --> 19:14.340]  or you can put that in the room in which the tent is in.
[19:14.340 --> 19:15.740]  If it sucks up a lot of space,
[19:15.740 --> 19:17.460]  a lot of square footage in your tent,
[19:17.460 --> 19:19.500]  I would consider putting it in the room.
[19:19.500 --> 19:21.420]  If you are growing on tables or trays
[19:21.420 --> 19:23.060]  and you've got plenty of floor space,
[19:23.060 --> 19:25.340]  why not throw that dehumidifier down there on the floor
[19:25.340 --> 19:27.100]  where you've got some open real estate?
[19:27.100 --> 19:30.180]  Again, I don't have all of the details about your grow.
[19:30.180 --> 19:31.580]  I don't know what you've got going on.
[19:31.580 --> 19:34.340]  So I can only give you options based on the idea,
[19:34.340 --> 19:36.100]  the blueprint that I've built in my head
[19:36.100 --> 19:38.100]  based on the information you have sent me.
[19:38.100 --> 19:39.860]  But it sounds like a dehumidifier
[19:39.860 --> 19:42.740]  may be the next thing you need to get for this grow.
[19:42.740 --> 19:44.180]  Another thing I would consider,
[19:44.180 --> 19:45.780]  I don't know if this is an option.
[19:45.780 --> 19:47.500]  You say that you are watering a lot
[19:47.500 --> 19:51.620]  and the plants are transpiring tons of moisture into the air.
[19:51.620 --> 19:55.140]  An idea is how about watering less water
[19:55.140 --> 19:56.980]  a little bit more frequently?
[19:57.860 --> 19:59.340]  So that way you don't have all that water in the room,
[19:59.340 --> 20:00.620]  all of that water in the pot,
[20:00.620 --> 20:03.140]  all the water from transpiration, it is all in the air.
[20:03.140 --> 20:05.180]  Maybe don't put so much water in there.
[20:05.180 --> 20:06.940]  Let it cycle, let it do its thing.
[20:06.940 --> 20:08.220]  Then water twice a day
[20:08.220 --> 20:11.100]  instead of one big fat watering once a day.
[20:11.100 --> 20:13.620]  Again, I don't know the size of pot you're working with.
[20:13.620 --> 20:15.700]  I don't know if you're in cocoa.
[20:15.700 --> 20:17.340]  I don't know if you're in hydro.
[20:17.340 --> 20:19.380]  I don't know if you were in soilless mix.
[20:19.380 --> 20:20.660]  I don't know your options.
[20:20.660 --> 20:23.340]  That is simply a suggestion that may help you out.
[20:23.340 --> 20:25.660]  Less water more frequently
[20:25.660 --> 20:28.340]  may be a benefit for this type of environment.
[20:28.340 --> 20:29.900]  Now, one thing that comes to mind,
[20:29.900 --> 20:32.100]  you may simply be over watering.
[20:32.100 --> 20:34.380]  If you have got that much air in the room,
[20:34.380 --> 20:37.340]  you may have put too much air into the plants.
[20:37.340 --> 20:39.780]  They can only let out as much as we give them.
[20:39.780 --> 20:41.500]  And if we are giving them too much,
[20:41.500 --> 20:43.580]  they may try to let out too much.
[20:43.580 --> 20:46.300]  Now that could be environmental, that could be watering,
[20:46.300 --> 20:47.900]  that could be a lot of things.
[20:47.900 --> 20:49.100]  We are going to figure that out
[20:49.100 --> 20:50.820]  because you're gonna get a PL Minder unit.
[20:50.820 --> 20:52.780]  You'll be able to dial in the VPD.
[20:52.780 --> 20:55.020]  Then we can decide how to set up the ducting.
[20:55.060 --> 20:57.580]  We can decide how to pipe that cool air into there.
[20:57.580 --> 21:00.340]  Then we can decide if we need to add a dehumidifier.
[21:00.340 --> 21:02.580]  I would absolutely work on cooling the room
[21:02.580 --> 21:05.180]  and circulating that air as much as possible.
[21:05.180 --> 21:08.340]  I would absolutely consider getting some ducting going,
[21:08.340 --> 21:09.500]  some sort of extraction.
[21:09.500 --> 21:12.300]  You need to evacuate that old air if possible.
[21:12.300 --> 21:14.580]  If you cannot evacuate that old air,
[21:14.580 --> 21:17.300]  I would recommend putting a dehumidifier in the room
[21:17.300 --> 21:19.980]  to reduce the relative humidity in the room.
[21:19.980 --> 21:22.500]  Then another thing you may want to consider
[21:22.500 --> 21:24.380]  is CO2 enrichment.
[21:24.380 --> 21:27.580]  You may want to augment the CO2 levels in that room.
[21:27.580 --> 21:28.860]  Since it is all sealed up
[21:28.860 --> 21:31.220]  and your air is not going anywhere anyway,
[21:31.220 --> 21:33.020]  pump that bitch with CO2
[21:33.020 --> 21:35.980]  and your plants will go ka-bang, ka-pow.
[21:35.980 --> 21:38.340]  Again, I don't know if you've got an extraction fan.
[21:38.340 --> 21:40.180]  I don't know your ducting setup.
[21:40.180 --> 21:42.980]  It says you just added a duct fan to boost airflow,
[21:42.980 --> 21:44.900]  but I don't know where that is coming or going from.
[21:44.900 --> 21:46.940]  I don't know if that is just a stir fan,
[21:46.940 --> 21:50.940]  but I hope I gave you some useful guidance and advice.
[21:50.940 --> 21:53.020]  I know you're gonna make great use
[21:53.060 --> 21:55.580]  of the PL Grow Minder unit that will be coming your way.
[21:55.580 --> 21:57.340]  So big thank you for the great email.
[21:57.340 --> 21:59.540]  If you have got any follow-up questions
[21:59.540 --> 22:01.700]  based on the information that I have given you today,
[22:01.700 --> 22:03.300]  I would love to hear back from you.
[22:03.300 --> 22:05.620]  I'm already expecting one message from you.
[22:05.620 --> 22:07.660]  So let me know if you need more information.
[22:07.660 --> 22:10.380]  Get back to me so we can get you that PL Minder unit.
[22:10.380 --> 22:12.940]  And then let me know how it all goes
[22:12.940 --> 22:15.060]  once you've got the ducting setup
[22:15.060 --> 22:16.980]  and the Minder unit in place.
[22:16.980 --> 22:18.140]  Once those are added in,
[22:18.140 --> 22:20.340]  we will know if you need to add the dehumidifier.
[22:20.340 --> 22:21.540]  Then from there, we can decide
[22:21.540 --> 22:23.220]  if you wanna add some CO2.
[22:23.220 --> 22:25.020]  Then we will make additional adjustments
[22:25.020 --> 22:28.620]  and we will get that room going kabang, kapow.
[22:28.620 --> 22:29.460]  All right, St. Stephen,
[22:29.460 --> 22:31.060]  I wanna thank you for a great email.
[22:31.060 --> 22:33.660]  I look forward to getting this PL Grow Minder unit to you
[22:33.660 --> 22:36.180]  so we can get your grow room dialed in.
[22:36.180 --> 22:37.740]  Once again, I wanna give a giant shout out
