[00:00.000 --> 00:02.440]  All right, here we go, podcast world.
[00:02.440 --> 00:04.540]  This is a quick Thursday episode.
[00:04.540 --> 00:07.660]  I wanted to wish everybody a happy holiday.
[00:07.660 --> 00:11.780]  Before I sat down to record, I was told that there was a death in my family, so I am really
[00:11.780 --> 00:16.500]  not in the mood or in the right mind to record a podcast.
[00:16.500 --> 00:20.620]  I wanted to come on here and thank everybody for all of the support that you've shown to
[00:20.620 --> 00:23.580]  the podcast and wish everybody a happy holiday season.
[00:23.580 --> 00:26.440]  So I'm going to do that very quickly.
[00:26.440 --> 00:27.440]  Happy holidays, everybody.
[00:27.440 --> 00:31.560]  Unfortunately, there was a death in my family and I've got a lot to deal with, so I'm going
[00:31.560 --> 00:35.080]  to be distracted from the podcast momentarily.
[00:35.080 --> 00:37.920]  I may be away from social media for a couple of days.
[00:37.920 --> 00:38.920]  I just need a break.
[00:38.920 --> 00:40.480]  I need to take good care of my family.
[00:40.480 --> 00:41.880]  I need to get my head right.
[00:41.880 --> 00:45.480]  I may be away for a funeral here very soon.
[00:45.480 --> 00:47.400]  Don't worry, the podcast is not going away.
[00:47.400 --> 00:52.400]  I just need a moment to regroup and handle my family and handle my life, and then I will
[00:52.400 --> 00:54.640]  be back with quality content.
[00:54.640 --> 00:56.840]  I wish I had a better holiday episode for you.
[00:56.840 --> 01:01.000]  I wish I had a better message for you other than happy holidays.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.640]  You guys, go spend some time with the people you love.
[01:03.640 --> 01:06.020]  Tell them you love them.
[01:06.020 --> 01:08.440]  People aren't going to be around forever and it fucking hurts when they go.
[01:08.440 --> 01:11.080]  So go spend some time with people you love.
[01:11.080 --> 01:12.400]  Go be around people you care about.
[01:12.400 --> 01:14.080]  Go eat some good food.
[01:14.080 --> 01:15.080]  Take good care of yourself.
[01:15.080 --> 01:17.640]  I'll do my best to get a Monday episode out.
[01:17.640 --> 01:19.440]  I make no promises on that Monday episode.
[01:19.440 --> 01:20.920]  I haven't missed a Monday in five years.
[01:20.920 --> 01:25.040]  It feels really weird to think about even missing a Monday show, but I've got a lot more stuff
[01:25.040 --> 01:26.680]  to deal with right now than a podcast.
[01:26.680 --> 01:29.000]  So excuse me, I apologize.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.480]  I'll be back as soon as I can get it together and I'll have fresh new content for you.
[01:32.480 --> 01:34.720]  I do have that mix episode written.
[01:34.720 --> 01:36.880]  I've got a lot of great content written.
[01:36.880 --> 01:39.960]  It's just going to be a struggle to produce an episode for a couple of days.
[01:39.960 --> 01:42.880]  So ladies and gentlemen, take great care of yourselves, please.
[01:42.880 --> 01:46.160]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
