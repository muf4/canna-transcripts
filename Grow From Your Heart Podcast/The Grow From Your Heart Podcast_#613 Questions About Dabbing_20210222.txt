[01:17.400 --> 01:22.480]  friends and really thank you guys for all of the continued patreon support. Most
[01:22.480 --> 01:26.680]  of this podcast episode does come from patreon questions so let's just jump
[01:26.680 --> 01:31.240]  right into it. This patreon member did ask to remain anonymous so this doesn't
[01:31.240 --> 01:36.440]  come from anybody with a specific name. It says hey Rasta Jeff you only consume
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.840]  dabs and I understand does dabbing require oh and it says and I understand
[01:40.840 --> 01:45.080]  so that makes more sense that way it says does dabbing require less cleanup
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.760]  and is dabbing more expensive than smoking flour? That's a great question if
[01:49.760 --> 01:53.680]  you do notice on the show most of the live shows I'm on most video feeds that
[01:53.680 --> 01:57.720]  I'm on I do talk about dabbing I don't talk much about smoking flour I do
[01:57.720 --> 02:03.200]  prefer to smoke mostly dabs I feel like to catch the buzz that I need from
[02:03.200 --> 02:07.120]  smoking flour I would have to just be smoking from the bong all day long I
[02:07.120 --> 02:10.800]  don't have time for that that's not super healthy for my lungs I don't need
[02:10.800 --> 02:14.360]  to be consuming a bunch of chlorophyll and green leafy matter I can get
[02:14.360 --> 02:19.360]  everything I need in a big fat dab if I take about a dab every hour maybe every
[02:19.360 --> 02:22.160]  two hours depends on what I'm doing that's in an ideal world you know if I'm
[02:22.160 --> 02:25.200]  hanging out doing work around here if I'm somewhere else then you don't get to
[02:25.200 --> 02:29.480]  do dabs every hour two hours maybe it's every four to six hours but in an ideal
[02:29.480 --> 02:33.440]  world I would just have to take a dab every hour maybe every two hours as to
[02:33.440 --> 02:36.880]  where if I were smoking flowers I would smoke until my throat was harsh my
[02:36.880 --> 02:41.840]  voice was dry my lungs were coughing up also I find that smoking flour makes my
[02:41.840 --> 02:46.680]  eyes much more red than smoking concentrates so being a podcaster being
[02:46.920 --> 02:51.400]  somebody who works with other people teaching people kind of in a boss
[02:51.400 --> 02:57.120]  situation most of the time I can't be real scratchy voiced real coffee lunged
[02:57.120 --> 03:00.600]  all the time real red-eyed and I can't be going to the car to take a bong rip
[03:00.600 --> 03:04.560]  every fucking 20 minutes so we get a break about every two hours in a real
[03:04.560 --> 03:08.440]  work environment so I pull a big fat dab about every two hours allegedly I don't
[03:08.440 --> 03:12.480]  know if I'm working for you maybe I'm not smoking dabs wink wink but so you
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.520]  will notice that I do prefer to smoke concentrates over the flowers however I
[03:17.520 --> 03:21.480]  have been smoking a lot of flowers lately I've got some great blue raspberry
[03:21.480 --> 03:24.400]  truffle flowers that were grown by a friend I got some good Nepali girl
[03:24.400 --> 03:28.800]  flowers ran into some good double dose flowers so I'm stocked up on good
[03:28.800 --> 03:32.840]  flowers right now I've been rolling King sized joints joints the size of my
[03:32.840 --> 03:36.600]  middle finger and during the Super Bowl I didn't watch the game I watched the
[03:36.600 --> 03:41.480]  Tom Tom Segura Bert Kreischer was the companion to the Super Bowl I watched
[03:41.480 --> 03:44.920]  that instead of watching the Super Bowl but that day smoked a big old giant
[03:44.920 --> 03:48.640]  joint during the Super Bowl anyway I digress I'm rambling you are correct I
[03:48.640 --> 03:53.800]  don't smoke a lot of flower on camera on video but I do smoke some flower if you
[03:53.800 --> 03:57.360]  watch the video with Mike and I that I recently put up I smoked a couple of
[03:57.360 --> 04:00.840]  bowls during that video so I do smoke flower but the main part of the question
[04:00.840 --> 04:07.400]  is dabbing less cleanup I don't know about that there is I guess everything
[04:07.400 --> 04:10.800]  is sticky is the bottom line when it comes to dabbing you've got a jar of
[04:10.840 --> 04:15.560]  concentrates you stick a little tool into that jar of concentrates now that
[04:15.560 --> 04:20.200]  tool is sticky you put that into the banger you put a carb cap on the banger
[04:20.200 --> 04:23.640]  now you've got a sticky dabber and a sticky banger you got to set those down
[04:23.640 --> 04:28.360]  somewhere when you put them down that surface becomes sticky so a lot of times
[04:28.360 --> 04:32.000]  my elbows and my hoodie sleeves are sticky because the table and desk around
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.680]  me are perpetually fucking sticky so I don't know that it's cleaner and less
[04:37.680 --> 04:41.960]  cleanup than smoking flowers there's no ashtray which I prefer I don't have to
[04:41.960 --> 04:45.660]  scrape out a bowl I don't have to scrape my bong scrape my pipe clean my pipe as
[04:45.660 --> 04:51.040]  often dabbing doesn't make that black funky residue the tari like shit but I
[04:51.040 --> 04:55.640]  don't know about cleaner everything is fucking sticky so we use a slick mat to
[04:55.640 --> 04:58.960]  put down on the table so that after you take a dab you could put your tools on
[04:58.960 --> 05:04.040]  there but then you got to clean that up with alcohol if you were dabbing what I
[05:04.120 --> 05:09.000]  used to call insert dabs or a bucket dabs you've got a thicker banger and you
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.600]  heat that up you put your dab inside of another bucket that looks like a thimble
[05:12.600 --> 05:16.240]  and you drop that inside of that banger so that you don't roast it kind of a
[05:16.240 --> 05:20.920]  double boiler is sort of the idea there but that way requires a whole nother
[05:20.920 --> 05:24.320]  setup of cleaning you need a thing of alcohol and you got to clean it
[05:24.320 --> 05:28.160]  immediately or it just gets too sticky so I don't know about cleaner or less
[05:28.160 --> 05:31.880]  cleanup everything is I keep saying everything is fucking sticky there was a
[05:31.880 --> 05:38.080]  point in time when I wanted to name the studio sticky knob studios it sounds a
[05:38.080 --> 05:41.480]  little bit obscene which is right up my alley but the idea was that everything
[05:41.480 --> 05:46.000]  was fucking sticky all my knobs my computer gear the table sticky table
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.240]  studios was an option I just went with GFYH studio grow from your heart studio
[05:50.240 --> 05:55.680]  it works out quite well but everything is sticky when you're dabbing so then it
[05:55.680 --> 06:00.080]  says is dabbing more expensive than smoking flour oh also another thing that
[06:00.080 --> 06:04.960]  I was gonna say the rig water isn't so bad compared to bong water if you clean
[06:04.960 --> 06:08.840]  if you keep your rig water fairly clean it's not nearly as bad as bong water
[06:08.840 --> 06:13.000]  when you spill it a bunch of funky shit's not gonna come spilling out the
[06:13.000 --> 06:17.160]  rig water the water inside of your rig if your rig is just dedicated to smoking
[06:17.160 --> 06:21.240]  dabs the water that pours out if you don't get big chunks of reclaim and oil
[06:21.240 --> 06:24.960]  just pouring out when you spill it it won't smell as bad it may actually smell
[06:24.960 --> 06:28.520]  kind of good sometimes when I clean my rig I dump out the water it smells like
[06:28.520 --> 06:32.240]  whatever the last few dabs I took were and sometimes it's really fucking
[06:32.240 --> 06:38.360]  delicious so rig water is not as bad as bong water if you keep them separate if
[06:38.360 --> 06:42.400]  you're smoking flowers and dabs through the same piece that water is gonna smell
[06:42.400 --> 06:46.360]  terrible and you are a fucking savage you need to get I don't I can't say need
[06:46.360 --> 06:49.880]  I recommend you would get two separate devices that way you can enjoy the
[06:49.880 --> 06:53.680]  flavor and turps of those dabs and enjoy the essence of that flower through two
[06:53.680 --> 06:57.560]  different pieces that's a totally different podcast is dabbing more
[06:57.560 --> 07:03.720]  expensive than smoking flower the initial setup to smoke dabs could be
[07:03.720 --> 07:07.480]  can be a little bit expensive there are some hurdles there to getting into
[07:07.480 --> 07:11.960]  smoking flower just smoking concentrates when you smoke flower you get a bag of
[07:11.960 --> 07:16.400]  weed or now it's a medicine jar filled with weed and you need a pipe or some
[07:16.400 --> 07:20.300]  rolling papers and a lighter and you're fucking smoking weed that's no no
[07:20.300 --> 07:23.560]  problem then you get into the accessory something to scrape it out or an ashtray
[07:23.560 --> 07:27.160]  maybe you get a bong something fancy to carry your pipe in but it doesn't go too
[07:27.160 --> 07:31.000]  far from there there's not too much fancy shit when it comes to taking dabs
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.520]  there is a lot of equipment involved you need a banger you need a rig you need a
[07:35.520 --> 07:39.480]  rig first of all and a banger that's your first combo the banger is what the
[07:39.480 --> 07:43.800]  dab goes into you neither need like a banger a nail there's something called a
[07:43.800 --> 07:46.960]  turps slurper there's a honey bucket there are all kinds of different
[07:46.960 --> 07:50.840]  variable nails it's the piece that the dab actually goes on to the piece that
[07:50.840 --> 07:54.480]  gets heated then you need a rig to put that on to that's the part that you
[07:54.480 --> 07:57.200]  smoke through it the water go it goes through the water then it goes up to
[07:57.200 --> 08:00.720]  your face the glass piece you smoke through that is your rig so you need a
[08:00.720 --> 08:05.880]  nail a banger a bucket a rig then you probably need a carb cap to cap that
[08:05.880 --> 08:09.640]  banger your bucket your turps slurper whatever you chose to go with I just
[08:09.640 --> 08:13.520]  like a normal club banger that's what I use then you're probably going to need a
[08:13.520 --> 08:18.800]  torch to heat that banger so now you're looking at anywhere from a hundred to
[08:18.800 --> 08:22.880]  thousands thousands of dollars for a rig we're gonna talk about that in a minute
[08:22.880 --> 08:28.240]  in a minute I do kind of have some notes so you need a rig a banger a torch a
[08:28.240 --> 08:31.720]  carb cap you need a dabber you need something to stick in the concentrates
[08:31.720 --> 08:35.960]  and transfer the dab from the concentrate to the banger then you're
[08:35.960 --> 08:39.520]  going to need Oh other things that you're gonna need q-tips why do we need
[08:39.520 --> 08:43.120]  q-tips after you take a dab that fucking banger is gonna be filthy you're gonna
[08:43.120 --> 08:46.000]  want to clean it out I like to use a q-tip just get in there and wipe it out
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.320]  a little bit then if you're a super cool you need something fancy you can't just
[08:50.320 --> 08:53.560]  throw the q-tips on the table you need something fancy to throw the q-tips in
[08:53.560 --> 08:58.280]  so you need a little fancy trash can for your q-tips then also you need a q-tip
[08:58.280 --> 09:01.840]  holder they can't just come out of the fucking plastic container you need
[09:01.840 --> 09:06.760]  matching glass q-tip holders and q-tip trash cans that's something if you're
[09:06.760 --> 09:09.560]  super cool if you're a heady boy if you're hyped up if you're going out in
[09:09.560 --> 09:12.400]  public and people are gonna see you that's the shit you got to have we'll
[09:12.400 --> 09:15.480]  talk about that in a minute then you need that slick mat that I talked about
[09:15.480 --> 09:19.280]  a minute ago something to set all your sticky shit on then a lot of people like
[09:19.280 --> 09:24.400]  to buy some sort of a mood mat a dab pad something thick sort of like a mouse
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.360]  pad they're basically repurposed mouse pads made out of that thin rubbery type
[09:28.360 --> 09:32.280]  stuff I don't know what it is honestly it's a mouse pad and they cut them into
[09:32.280 --> 09:34.960]  that you can get them cut into all kinds of shapes every brand out there's got
[09:34.960 --> 09:39.280]  their logo eventually you'll see the Rostagef dab mat the rig mat the rig pad
[09:39.280 --> 09:44.000]  the mood mat but that is to set your rig on so that you don't have to set your
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.880]  expensive thousand dollar rig back down on the hardwood table every time you
[09:47.880 --> 09:50.840]  take a dab you got that soft little surface you don't hear tink tink every
[09:50.840 --> 09:54.840]  time you sit your rig down just feels nice so there are a lot of things to buy
[09:54.840 --> 09:59.640]  to get into dabbing so once you're over the entry hurdles then it's not
[09:59.640 --> 10:04.080]  expensive per se to take dabs it's no more expensive than smoking flour once
[10:04.080 --> 10:08.560]  you're into it like I said you can get yourself a cheap rig for probably 75 to
[10:08.560 --> 10:11.560]  100 bucks maybe a little bit cheaper depending on where you are but then they
[10:11.560 --> 10:14.560]  go all the way up to thousands and thousands of dollars there are rigs that
[10:14.560 --> 10:19.200]  I drool over that are in the five and ten thousand dollar price range you can
[10:19.200 --> 10:22.840]  get a banger depends on where you go where you are who you know what store
[10:22.840 --> 10:27.200]  you shop at probably about 30 to 50 bucks for a good banger you can get them
[10:27.200 --> 10:32.200]  for 300 bucks it's all about what you want to spend the entry level 30 40 high
[10:32.200 --> 10:36.640]  quality shit three five maybe a thousand dollars for a banger I know it sounds
[10:36.640 --> 10:41.680]  ridiculous we're gonna talk about that in a minute a torch anywhere from 50 to
[10:41.680 --> 10:45.280]  100 bucks for a torch don't be afraid to spend 80 to 100 dollars on a torch a
[10:45.280 --> 10:49.360]  dab or you could buy a lot of different devices for a dabber I take bigger dabs
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.160]  and most folks so I use I use a bigger dabber than most people it's a happy
[10:54.160 --> 10:57.880]  daddy dabber I think it's called the glob father shout out to our friends at
[10:57.880 --> 11:00.760]  happy daddy I don't think they're doing things anymore but shout out shout it to
[11:00.760 --> 11:05.400]  my buddy hope you're well buddy anyway we're not gonna go too far into that
[11:05.400 --> 11:09.400]  then you need a carb cap a carb cap can be anywhere you can get a clear one for
[11:09.400 --> 11:13.400]  like 20 bucks or you can get a fancy one like I keep saying three five maybe
[11:13.400 --> 11:16.280]  seven or nine hundred maybe a thousand dollars if you want a mothership carb
[11:16.280 --> 11:20.160]  cap they could be 2,500 bucks they're not even called carb caps they got their
[11:20.160 --> 11:24.400]  own special name so things can be cheap things can get really expensive a dab mat
[11:24.400 --> 11:29.620]  can be anywhere from 30 to 100 bucks q-tips get the q-tips don't buy normal
[11:29.620 --> 11:32.500]  q-tips to clean your dab rig they're gonna melt in the banger if you're
[11:32.500 --> 11:38.040]  trying to clean if that oil still hot get glob mobs glob mops something like
[11:38.040 --> 11:41.400]  that something that's kind of aimed for the dabbers they're a little bit thicker
[11:41.400 --> 11:44.680]  a little more industrial strength I think they're honestly made for the
[11:44.680 --> 11:49.800]  cosmetic industry that's not my alley but get the better q-tips then that
[11:49.800 --> 11:55.320]  q-tip holder bro you got to get a fancy heady q-tip holder then let's talk about
[11:55.320 --> 11:59.920]  the prices of dabs versus flower once you've got all that gear the prices
[11:59.920 --> 12:05.240]  aren't too far apart buying like an eighth of flower versus I don't know
[12:05.240 --> 12:09.480]  where you live I don't know what shit costs where you are honestly here right
[12:09.480 --> 12:14.040]  now in Colorado you can get an ounce of weed for anywhere between 90 to 240
[12:14.040 --> 12:18.280]  bucks the quality will vary based on your price just like you should expect
[12:18.280 --> 12:23.960]  the $90 ounce looks like a $90 ounce the 240 looks like a $240 ounce it's what
[12:23.960 --> 12:27.960]  you would expect here in Colorado these grams depending on who you are where you
[12:27.960 --> 12:33.720]  are one gram of this is my concentrative choice today the garlic banger number
[12:33.720 --> 12:36.760]  nine from green dot they don't pay me to say that they don't advertise with me
[12:36.760 --> 12:40.640]  they don't I don't we don't have any deals I pay cash for this shit I am
[12:40.640 --> 12:44.240]  friends at the dispensary I was actually the first person to buy recreational
[12:44.240 --> 12:49.400]  cannabis in this county so I was from this dispensary the same ownership so
[12:49.400 --> 12:52.880]  I've got a little bit of a VIP friends and family discount that does help me
[12:52.880 --> 12:56.600]  out not tremendously I'm not complaining I do get a little bit of a discount it's
[12:56.600 --> 12:59.600]  like 10% which is it goes a far away when you're buying 300 bucks with the
[12:59.600 --> 13:03.320]  concentrates but they don't advertise with me they don't pay me it's just what
[13:03.320 --> 13:07.360]  I like I love garlic turps this is a good brand quality product it's in my
[13:07.360 --> 13:14.520]  price point I think these are 40 or 45 dollars without any discounts so you get
[13:14.520 --> 13:19.720]  an ounce for about around you know 240 if you want to get that top shelf shit
[13:19.720 --> 13:22.960]  if you want to get some stuff that is not you don't want to show it off on
[13:22.960 --> 13:26.640]  Instagram or anything it's gonna be like 80 90 maybe a hundred bucks a gram of
[13:26.640 --> 13:31.200]  top shelf concentrate 45 bucks maybe maybe you can find it for 35 somewhere
[13:31.200 --> 13:34.320]  between 35 and 50 out the door is what you should expect for a top shelf
[13:34.320 --> 13:38.960]  concentrate so I don't know about the price difference because I would smoke a
[13:38.960 --> 13:43.760]  lot of flour you would have to be blowing a bong hit in each ear while I
[13:43.760 --> 13:48.040]  take a bong hit through my face and maybe do bong hits through other orify
[13:48.040 --> 13:53.080]  at the same time to get me nearly as high as I can get off of one dab of this
[13:53.080 --> 13:57.200]  garlic banger live batter so or it's a actually this one's full spectrum
[13:57.200 --> 14:01.720]  extract it's got a real nice punch to it crystals and sauce diamonds and sauce
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.480]  so cost-effective it just kind of depends on what you prefer there are
[14:06.480 --> 14:10.000]  more affordable concentrates just like there are more affordable flowers there
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.680]  are also more expensive concentrates I just prefer the green dot and they don't
[14:14.680 --> 14:19.120]  pay me to say that I paid cash for this today it's what I chose to buy with my
[14:19.120 --> 14:22.880]  own pocket money so also tip your bud tender when you're buying shit you guys
[14:22.880 --> 14:26.120]  that fucking tip jar was not full enough today for how many cars were in the
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.720]  parking lot stuff that tip jar so is dabbing more expensive than smoking
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.560]  flour I don't think so if you were the type of person that likes to just have a
[14:35.560 --> 14:38.760]  pipe in your hand have a bowl and just be puffing on something all the time
[14:38.760 --> 14:44.720]  maybe maybe the flour will get expensive because I like to take a dab and then
[14:44.720 --> 14:48.360]  maybe I take a dab and then I wait an hour maybe two hours for another dab
[14:48.360 --> 14:51.200]  honestly I'll take two or three dabs and then wait an hour or two for another one
[14:51.200 --> 14:54.560]  but I'm just chilling I'm not you know I like to have that pipe in my hand I just
[14:54.560 --> 14:58.280]  carry my bowl around and hit a bowl occasionally it's nice to know that if
[14:58.280 --> 15:01.400]  you're just sitting there watching a Netflix video or a YouTube video you
[15:01.400 --> 15:06.080]  don't have to get out the torch and heat up the fucking dab nail and do all that
[15:06.080 --> 15:09.400]  work you could just pick up your lighter pick up your bowl take a couple of quick
[15:09.400 --> 15:12.520]  puffs off the bowl and just enhance the buzz that you've already got it kind of
[15:12.520 --> 15:15.560]  keeps it going keeps riding it so if you're the kind of person that likes to
[15:15.560 --> 15:19.520]  keep talking on something you may go through all of your concentrates super
[15:19.520 --> 15:23.080]  quickly but if you're the kind of person they can just take a dab every hour a
[15:23.120 --> 15:26.280]  dab every two hours and they're not gigantic dabs it could be more cost
[15:26.280 --> 15:31.760]  effective now I was joking earlier about all of that fancy equipment why do people
[15:31.760 --> 15:37.280]  have $3,000 rigs why do people buy custom-made torches why do people buy a
[15:37.280 --> 15:40.840]  thousand dollar carb cap what the fuck there's a $30 carb cap sitting right
[15:40.840 --> 15:45.480]  there on the shelf why would I buy the one that's $1,200 and fucking purple and
[15:45.480 --> 15:48.720]  faceted and has all kinds of different colors of glass in it they're both glass
[15:48.880 --> 15:53.840]  they're gonna do the same thing it has become a cultural thing to that's a way
[15:53.840 --> 15:58.440]  to flex to show off a lot of people wear chains a lot of people drive fast cars
[15:58.440 --> 16:02.920]  some of us like to wear fancy shoes a lot of people prefer to show off that
[16:02.920 --> 16:07.480]  they're doing okay by having a really fancy glass setup it's something we do
[16:07.480 --> 16:11.840]  so a lot of us we do it often all day every day it's something we're
[16:11.840 --> 16:14.320]  passionate about you could definitely say I'm passionate about consuming
[16:14.320 --> 16:18.360]  cannabis and consuming concentrates so it only makes sense to have and then
[16:18.520 --> 16:21.960]  Rastafari we call it the chalice that's my chalice that's part of my ceremony
[16:21.960 --> 16:25.880]  part of my connection with the most I job part of my connection with you so
[16:25.880 --> 16:29.680]  why not have something that's ornate and decorative it makes me smile when I see
[16:29.680 --> 16:35.240]  it so that's why a lot of people spend extravagant extraordinary money on a rig
[16:35.240 --> 16:38.560]  that is shaped like their favorite cartoon character that's got their
[16:38.560 --> 16:43.080]  favorite color scheme or eyes orange and has crazy spirals on it and hits just
[16:43.080 --> 16:46.520]  the way that they like it or maybe a lot of times it's just an artist that they
[16:46.520 --> 16:50.840]  are buying from is very well known and has a good reputation just like if you
[16:50.840 --> 16:53.720]  wanted to buy a really fancy painting from an artist that's well known you're
[16:53.720 --> 16:57.000]  gonna pay extra money for it if you want to buy a painting from me it's a dollar
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  cuz nobody knows who the fuck I am my paintings are cheap so the glass game
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.600]  and art goes just like that some people want to have nice shit just to show you
[17:04.600 --> 17:09.120]  that they're doing okay some people will just save all their money for that one
[17:09.120 --> 17:12.680]  real nice ornate fucking rig so that's what they've got they got a nice rig a
[17:12.800 --> 17:16.640]  nice carb cap in their smoke session their smoke ceremony is top-notch
[17:16.640 --> 17:20.160]  they're smoking the best concentrates they can through the best piece they can
[17:20.160 --> 17:25.400]  that's just what a lot of people do I myself I prefer a rig that is not super
[17:25.400 --> 17:28.320]  ornate I've got a couple of rigs a few rigs that are quite decorated they've
[17:28.320 --> 17:32.040]  got I've got one with a really stylish Star of David on the back I fucking love
[17:32.040 --> 17:35.520]  it however I'm afraid that I'm gonna bump it on something and break that Star
[17:35.520 --> 17:39.280]  of David off I'm gonna pass it to a buddy and it's gonna get broken and I'm
[17:39.280 --> 17:42.640]  gonna be heartbroken because it's beautiful artwork which that's what
[17:42.640 --> 17:47.440]  happens when you're using glass but my favorite rig is what I call functional
[17:47.440 --> 17:53.080]  scientific glass it has got a spot for your banger to go it's got a down stem
[17:53.080 --> 17:57.120]  that splits off two directions it percolates on two sides it's a small rig
[17:57.120 --> 18:00.040]  that fits in the palm of my hand with the mouthpiece that goes straight to my
[18:00.040 --> 18:04.640]  face that's what we call a sidecar and then the mouthpiece is flared out like a
[18:04.640 --> 18:09.160]  like a fucking exhaust pipe or a trumpet it doesn't have one of those like a peepee
[18:09.240 --> 18:12.640]  shaped mouthpiece you got to make a funky lip funky lip shape to try to hit
[18:12.640 --> 18:16.240]  it it's flared out and I really think that I get a better dab because my mouth
[18:16.240 --> 18:20.120]  fits better on it I don't have to make a funky face I take monstrous dabs
[18:20.120 --> 18:24.880]  compared to a lot of people bigger dabs than you should and with the smaller the
[18:24.880 --> 18:28.680]  peepee shape and the phallic kind of shape mouthpieces I get a lot of build-up
[18:28.680 --> 18:31.960]  around my lips when I take a dab of fat a fat dab of concentrates with that
[18:31.960 --> 18:35.600]  flared mouthpiece I don't get that effect because there's more surface area
[18:35.600 --> 18:39.840]  for that dab to get through I don't get all sticky lips so that's some rants on
[18:39.840 --> 18:44.520]  why we buy expensive rigs rig preferences people just they're trying to
[18:44.520 --> 18:48.240]  flex a lot of young kids a lot of fucking other folks are just saying hey
[18:48.240 --> 18:51.800]  look I did all right one month or a couple of months I saved up or I just
[18:51.800 --> 18:54.520]  fucking maxed out the credit card and I got this rig I'm gonna set it on the
[18:54.520 --> 18:58.320]  table and everyone's gonna go ooh ah then we're all gonna dab out of it we've
[18:58.320 --> 19:01.720]  got a really ornate piece that we could be proud of also you can support and
[19:01.720 --> 19:07.880]  show off one of your favorite artists so dabbing prices versus flower prices
[19:07.880 --> 19:12.720]  that's debatable you could buy top or bottom shelf product I mean you can get
[19:12.720 --> 19:16.080]  top shelf product or bottom shelf product when it comes to dabs or when it
[19:16.080 --> 19:20.440]  comes to flowers I've seen people buy bottom shelf concentrates and complain
[19:20.440 --> 19:23.560]  that that store sell shitty product if you go to any store and you buy the
[19:23.560 --> 19:28.080]  bottom shelf shit expect bottom shelf shit if that's concentrates or flowers
[19:28.080 --> 19:33.680]  don't complain about that also if you're buying pens pens can get a little
[19:33.680 --> 19:39.880]  bit expensive the cartridges are like 30 to 50 or something bucks for a I think
[19:39.880 --> 19:43.360]  it's a half a gram it's point five of whatever's in there it's a liquid unit a
[19:43.360 --> 19:45.800]  measurement I don't remember that measurement wasn't prepared for that
[19:45.800 --> 19:50.960]  those can get expensive quite quickly however I love how discreet they are if
[19:50.960 --> 19:54.560]  I were gonna be in a place where we really aren't supposed to smoke or
[19:54.560 --> 19:58.160]  consume products I could just say I've got to go to the bathroom and I can
[19:58.160 --> 20:02.720]  allegedly possibly take three to four good rips off of a pen one in the
[20:02.720 --> 20:07.040]  hallway two while I'm taking a piss and one in the hallway on the way back and I
[20:07.040 --> 20:10.360]  can get fairly ripped off of a pen if you got to go to a concert you don't
[20:10.360 --> 20:13.360]  want to take the dab torch or your joints and shit into the concert a
[20:13.360 --> 20:17.360]  couple of pens take those right on in you can smoke with a pen so the pins are
[20:17.360 --> 20:21.800]  semi cost-effective for what they are I think they're great for their price if
[20:21.800 --> 20:25.480]  you get a good battery and a good cartridge that you can replace they're
[20:25.480 --> 20:29.840]  cost-effective for what they are for their advantage if you're a casual smoker
[20:29.840 --> 20:33.480]  if you're not a heavy dabber those pins will get you fucked up I like to do
[20:33.480 --> 20:37.040]  double pins I call it the double dragon put a pen in each side of my mouth and
[20:37.040 --> 20:41.960]  hit two pins at the same time so you get a big fat cloud that shit gets expensive
[20:41.960 --> 20:48.240]  also there is wax wax is cheap if you're buying shatter or wax that shit should
[20:48.240 --> 20:53.720]  be like 15 maybe 12 15 maybe $22 a gram depending where you are that's very
[20:53.720 --> 21:00.280]  affordable there is also sh o solventless honey oil that shits anywhere
[21:00.280 --> 21:05.400]  from 85 to 150 dollars a gram if you want some of what they call Percy rosin
[21:05.400 --> 21:09.840]  personal rosin from some companies will run you a hundred and fifty dollars per
[21:09.840 --> 21:13.560]  gram so it depends on how hard you want to flex with your equipment and your
[21:13.560 --> 21:17.400]  products if you want to buy affordable stuff and just be satisfied you can do
[21:17.400 --> 21:20.200]  that if you want to throw your whole wallet your whole fucking paycheck at
[21:20.200 --> 21:24.760]  the dispensary and at the fucking glass store that is also an option I'm gonna
[21:24.760 --> 21:28.240]  take a sip of this marvelous coconut pineapple juice out of this beautiful
[21:28.240 --> 21:30.480]  girl from your heart rig and then we will continue this show
[21:30.480 --> 21:42.060]  sips tea oh that is delicious and tropical and refreshing all at the same
[21:42.060 --> 21:46.420]  time so I think that covers up that part of this episode let's move on to the
[21:46.420 --> 21:50.380]  next part of this question it says you hardly ever talk about what you're
[21:50.380 --> 21:55.140]  dabbing on before the show anymore is that by choice there are a couple of
[21:55.140 --> 22:00.860]  reasons that factored into that politely I touched on this a moment ago nobody
[22:00.860 --> 22:04.980]  pays me to advertise for their product nobody I get a little bit of a discount
[22:04.980 --> 22:08.060]  from my friends at the dispensary shout out to my friends at the Colorado
[22:08.060 --> 22:11.580]  Cannabis Exchange they are actually the ones that hook me up and give me good
[22:11.580 --> 22:16.420]  deals none of the concentrate companies reached out or replied when I talked
[22:16.420 --> 22:20.700]  about doing a sponsorship deal or an advertising deal I said hey I'm smoking
[22:20.700 --> 22:25.060]  your shit on 600 podcasts would you like to work out a deal maybe just help me
[22:25.060 --> 22:29.820]  with concentrates or something like that I didn't get a reaction and I just chose
[22:29.820 --> 22:33.500]  to if they're not going to respond I'm not going to give them a boost on every
[22:33.500 --> 22:37.100]  episode it just seems fair that way I still enjoy the concentrates I'm still
[22:37.100 --> 22:40.620]  smoking them so that's my polite way of saying nobody wanted to do an
[22:40.620 --> 22:44.340]  advertising deal so they're not gonna get free advertising maybe that's a
[22:44.340 --> 22:48.060]  capitalist attitude but that is a advertising is expensive and they were
[22:48.060 --> 22:53.100]  getting it for free to be quite honest with you so that is honestly I try to be
[22:53.100 --> 22:56.460]  completely honest and transparent that is a fucking completely honest answer
[22:56.460 --> 23:00.300]  part of why I stopped talking about what I'm smoking because it's always the same
[23:00.300 --> 23:04.100]  brand I just told you who I enjoy I like to smoke green dot labs I like there I
[23:04.100 --> 23:08.300]  prefer their batter the live batter is my favorite I will smoke the full
[23:08.300 --> 23:13.380]  spectrum extract if that's what you give me but I prefer the batter so also I
[23:13.420 --> 23:16.820]  didn't think anybody really cared I got a couple of comments like hey bro nobody
[23:16.820 --> 23:20.300]  cares what you're fucking smoking can we just move on with the podcast and if
[23:20.300 --> 23:22.740]  people don't care what I'm talking about then there's no sense in talking about
[23:22.740 --> 23:28.020]  it so I just moved on with the podcast um yeah and I guess uh another thing I
[23:28.020 --> 23:31.500]  was gonna mention I've been taking less dabs I don't know if you notice I clear
[23:31.500 --> 23:35.300]  my throat less on the podcast my throat is less itchy I feel like the show is
[23:35.300 --> 23:40.140]  better the show has only been 25 to 32 minutes long lately because I don't
[23:40.140 --> 23:45.180]  spend fucking six extra minutes talking about dumb shit cuz I'm too high so in
[23:45.180 --> 23:48.500]  my opinion the show has been better with less dabs I've been more functional and
[23:48.500 --> 23:52.580]  I'm not dabbing super hard before the show I used to take like fucking six
[23:52.580 --> 23:55.660]  dabs before the show don't get me wrong I took two or three fatty dabs tonight
[23:55.660 --> 23:59.460]  before I did this podcast but I didn't try to dab myself into a fucking coma
[23:59.460 --> 24:03.980]  like I used to do so that is also part of why I don't talk about why or what
[24:03.980 --> 24:07.800]  I'm dabbing so much honest answer nobody's paying me for the free
[24:07.800 --> 24:11.000]  advertising they've been getting for multiple episodes I didn't think anybody
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.680]  gave a shit and I've been dabbing less I actually took a couple of dabbing days
[24:16.680 --> 24:20.160]  off I thought it would be good for me I went to the doctor just for a regular
[24:20.160 --> 24:22.760]  checkup I had a cold that lasted a couple of days I went to go make sure
[24:22.760 --> 24:26.360]  that I was okay during this season which we're in you know the docs like now
[24:26.360 --> 24:29.640]  you're young and healthy we talked about the things I do the doctor said are you
[24:29.640 --> 24:33.840]  addicted to cannabis and I said I don't think so the doctor said do me a favor
[24:33.840 --> 24:37.160]  give me three days without cannabis and I said I'll see your three days I'll
[24:37.160 --> 24:42.200]  give you five and the doc said game on I went three days and I was like that
[24:42.200 --> 24:45.640]  was easy I didn't smoke a single dab I didn't eat any edibles I'm fucking
[24:45.640 --> 24:48.880]  living large I went five days and I was like this is a good time I think I'm
[24:48.880 --> 24:53.480]  gonna try to go seven full days without smoking and I went seven full days
[24:53.480 --> 24:58.240]  without smoking when I got to seven days I decided let's go ten days and there's
[24:58.240 --> 25:01.760]  just something in my brain something in me clicked and I was like well let's do
[25:01.760 --> 25:06.240]  ten days and at day 11 I was like ten days was cool I can do 11 and I thought
[25:06.240 --> 25:12.240]  the challenge was three I made it 11 on day 12 I took a dab and I got high you
[25:12.240 --> 25:17.000]  guys I was high school high I had to chill out on the couch for a couple of
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.080]  minutes I had to regroup I had to recoup I had to recover I had to write my name
[25:21.080 --> 25:23.800]  down on a fucking piece of paper and keep looking at it just to remember who
[25:23.800 --> 25:29.440]  the shit I was it was a really good time so I realized at that point when dabs
[25:29.440 --> 25:33.840]  weren't affecting me like I could take fucking three fat dabs and do whatever
[25:33.840 --> 25:37.200]  you needed done if we're at work and you're like hey a corporate called we
[25:37.200 --> 25:40.480]  need you to talk to him I could be hitting the dab rig and blow out my dab
[25:40.480 --> 25:43.480]  and talk to corporate you know what I mean I could talk to whatever I could do
[25:43.480 --> 25:47.040]  whatever I shouldn't talk about some of the physical activities that I did like
[25:47.040 --> 25:51.920]  with machinery and driving equipment and stuff but allegedly I could still do all
[25:51.920 --> 25:56.200]  that shit just fine which meant something after I took 11 days off and
[25:56.200 --> 26:00.560]  took a dab that nearly incapacitated me maybe I was overdoing it maybe I was
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.520]  just dabbing too hard since I took my little break I feel like I'm working
[26:05.520 --> 26:09.560]  back up to where I was honestly so I took another couple of day breaks and
[26:09.560 --> 26:12.680]  then I would smoke for like a week and then take a day or two off now that I've
[26:12.680 --> 26:17.120]  been taking little breaks I get much higher my buzz is much more enjoyable it
[26:17.120 --> 26:21.240]  sticks around for a little bit longer it comes on a little bit stronger so
[26:21.240 --> 26:24.920]  sometimes I'll blow out that dab and my eyes get heavy and I'm like oh shit I
[26:24.920 --> 26:28.000]  need a minute got to grab onto the table and make sure I don't float away or
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.160]  something like that but I think it was really advantageous to take that little
[26:32.160 --> 26:35.480]  bit of a dab break so I was dabbing a little bit less is one of the reasons
[26:35.480 --> 26:38.920]  why you didn't hear me talking about what I'm dabbing on the show I think it
[26:38.920 --> 26:42.360]  was good for me the doctor said give me three days I was like I'll see your
[26:42.360 --> 26:46.720]  three and give you five something in my brain like the challenge I went 11 days
[26:46.720 --> 26:50.360]  without a dab day 11 we got fucking erect you guys and then it taught me a
[26:50.360 --> 26:53.980]  lot about myself it taught me that maybe I'm not smoking medicinally maybe I'm
[26:53.980 --> 26:58.220]  not smoking recreationally maybe I'm just smoking fucking habitually it's not
[26:58.220 --> 27:01.220]  even about chasing the buzz it's not even about feeling good it's not even
[27:01.220 --> 27:04.700]  keeping myself healthy it was just when I'm sitting here editing a podcast or
[27:04.700 --> 27:08.300]  writing a podcast or watching a YouTube video I got some time to kill what are
[27:08.300 --> 27:13.060]  you gonna do take a dab the the hardest thing was after I would eat a fat meal
[27:13.060 --> 27:16.620]  was to not go take a big fat dab after I ate because that's one of my favorite
[27:16.620 --> 27:20.580]  things do you finish up a meal put the dishes in the sink clean yourself up go
[27:20.580 --> 27:23.380]  take a fat drink of something to get all that spicy out of your mouth because I
[27:23.380 --> 27:27.180]  ate a lot of spicy food chill out for a minute and then you look at whoever
[27:27.180 --> 27:30.260]  you're with and you go you're ready for some dabs and everybody goes fuck yeah
[27:30.260 --> 27:32.780]  and you head into wherever you take dabs you go get the rig and you take some
[27:32.780 --> 27:35.660]  dabs I'm sure you got some sort of routine like that that was the hardest
[27:35.660 --> 27:39.500]  part for me was not dabbing after every single fucking meal that I put in my
[27:39.500 --> 27:42.980]  face I am running out of time but there are more parts to this question let me
[27:42.980 --> 27:48.140]  keep moving oh let me see it's on the next next page here it says since dabbing
[27:48.140 --> 27:52.260]  concentrates are sometimes as high as 70% does that ruin your tolerance of
[27:52.260 --> 27:56.460]  smoking flour at all or do you still get a buzz like I mentioned before
[27:56.460 --> 28:01.100]  tolerance breaks are key now yes I am getting stoned again when I smoke flour
[28:01.100 --> 28:05.020]  and I like to smoke flour because I'm a breeder I'll breed some stuff I'll grow
[28:05.020 --> 28:08.900]  it out then I get to select which phenotype gets me the better buzz that
[28:08.900 --> 28:12.460]  has a lot to do with what gets selected for next breeding projects gets moved
[28:12.460 --> 28:16.060]  forward with so I like to smoke those flowers which means I need to be able to
[28:16.060 --> 28:20.860]  feel the effect taste the aromas and flavors and enjoy that flower to make
[28:20.980 --> 28:24.980]  good decisions with breeding so what's the question again I got so stoned I
[28:24.980 --> 28:28.700]  forgot do you still get a buzz from smoking flour yes because I do take
[28:28.700 --> 28:32.860]  tolerance breaks and it's a bit of a different buzz I say that a lot of times
[28:32.860 --> 28:36.660]  dabbing will make me bug I got this beanie over my face right now but dabbing
[28:36.660 --> 28:41.060]  makes me like whoa I'm high I'm so high but smoking good flour makes my eyes
[28:41.060 --> 28:45.540]  heavy and makes me like oh I'm stoned and so in the evening in the nighttime
[28:45.540 --> 28:48.340]  when I'm chilling out I like to carry around that bowl and just hit on a bowl
[28:48.340 --> 28:52.500]  or whatever if you're doing shaving getting in the shower editing a podcast
[28:52.500 --> 28:55.660]  I got the dab rig and the bowl next to me so I can hit that bowl smoke those
[28:55.660 --> 29:00.500]  flowers get myself nice and chilled out nice and mellow I like to be mellow and
[29:00.500 --> 29:04.140]  I mentioned earlier I like that comfort of just carrying a bowl around with me
[29:04.140 --> 29:08.900]  just having that bowl maybe it's cuz I've been a pothead for a fucking 20
[29:08.900 --> 29:13.460]  something 30 something years I guess and just knowing that I've got that bowl
[29:13.460 --> 29:17.620]  even if I'm not gonna smoke it right now but just knowing that this is here
[29:17.620 --> 29:21.380]  whenever I decide just to smoke this bowl I'm gonna take a couple of puffs
[29:21.380 --> 29:24.100]  all I gotta do is put this one thing in my pocket with this other thing in my
[29:24.100 --> 29:28.100]  pocket flick one and rub it on the other one I got a lighter I got a bowl we can
[29:28.100 --> 29:32.620]  be stoned whenever we want to that's just a nice so security feeling it's
[29:32.620 --> 29:35.660]  like having a security blanket right there in my pocket I just pull it out
[29:35.660 --> 29:40.500]  get stoned whenever I want to so concentrates are as high as 70% somewhere
[29:40.500 --> 29:47.580]  like in the 80s bro this one here 83 this one here 70.90 so we got some
[29:47.580 --> 29:52.660]  high-ranking concentrates this one is the bubblegum t1000 this is the live
[29:52.660 --> 29:56.780]  batter great taste and shit got me nice and stony today that one and the garlic
[29:56.780 --> 30:01.300]  banger have had me in a nice buzz today all right I think that is all I've got
