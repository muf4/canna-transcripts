[00:02.110 --> 00:05.230]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.230 --> 00:09.310]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:09.310 --> 00:10.810]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:10.810 --> 00:15.310]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:15.310 --> 00:19.530]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious
[00:19.530 --> 00:23.710]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:23.710 --> 00:25.990]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.990 --> 00:29.110]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:29.110 --> 00:33.070]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:33.070 --> 00:37.450]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:37.450 --> 00:40.930]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:40.930 --> 00:45.050]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[00:45.050 --> 00:54.910]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:54.910 --> 00:56.070]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:56.070 --> 00:59.470]  It's time for episode 306 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:59.470 --> 01:03.550]  I like to start these episodes off by letting you know what I've been dabbing on today.
[01:03.550 --> 01:09.430]  Today I'm taking dabs of Jet Fuel Live Resin Full Spectrum Extract from Green Dot Labs.
[01:09.430 --> 01:11.510]  This stuff has been amazing.
[01:11.510 --> 01:15.510]  I've got a little tiny jar with a little bit left, and when I crack open this jar, the
[01:15.510 --> 01:17.730]  aroma just fills this room.
[01:17.730 --> 01:24.030]  This whole room is filled with a skunky, funky, fuely, gassy sort of a smell.
[01:24.030 --> 01:25.950]  I guess you would call it jet fuel.
[01:26.030 --> 01:31.510]  I open this jar, and the smell that comes out is like, kind of smells like you were
[01:31.510 --> 01:36.210]  kicking a skunk in the ass all day, and then you tried to rinse that aroma off with some
[01:36.210 --> 01:41.430]  diesel fuel, then you threw those hot shoes in the car in the sun all day, and then you
[01:41.430 --> 01:46.590]  got in the car, and that overwhelming, fuely, skunky smell that hits your eyes and kind
[01:46.590 --> 01:50.750]  of makes your eyes burn and makes you squint, that's what this smells like, and it is beautiful.
[01:50.750 --> 01:51.790]  I love it.
[01:51.790 --> 01:57.250]  It is fuely, it's skunky, it's disgustingly beautiful, and I can't get enough of it.
[01:57.250 --> 02:00.410]  The texture and appearance are also beautiful.
[02:00.410 --> 02:02.890]  It is perfectly golden and clear.
[02:02.890 --> 02:08.610]  What I like about it a lot is the amount of crystals or chunks and the amount of liquids
[02:08.610 --> 02:09.650]  or terps.
[02:09.650 --> 02:11.730]  It is not too runny and too saucy for me.
[02:11.730 --> 02:13.830]  I don't prefer the really liquid concentrates.
[02:13.830 --> 02:20.130]  I prefer the chunkier, so this is probably 70% chunks and 30% crystals, which is just
[02:20.130 --> 02:21.650]  about right for my style.
[02:21.670 --> 02:22.670]  I really like it.
[02:22.670 --> 02:24.950]  I was able to get a big, fat dab on the dabber.
[02:24.950 --> 02:27.230]  I really appreciate that.
[02:27.230 --> 02:30.910]  When I took the dab, it gave me the most intense cottonmouth.
[02:30.910 --> 02:33.950]  I haven't had cottonmouth like that in quite a long time.
[02:33.950 --> 02:34.950]  That was kind of nice.
[02:34.950 --> 02:35.950]  It tasted really well.
[02:35.950 --> 02:39.430]  The cottonmouth had a pleasant, it tasted just like the concentrate.
[02:39.430 --> 02:44.310]  It also gave me a nice eye-high, and also, I found myself standing in the middle of the
[02:44.310 --> 02:46.870]  kitchen for no reason after I took that dab.
[02:46.870 --> 02:48.950]  I had a drink, and I have eaten.
[02:48.970 --> 02:52.690]  I wasn't hungry or need a drink or anything, but I took a dab, and the next thing I knew,
[02:52.690 --> 02:55.330]  I was just standing in the middle of the kitchen.
[02:55.330 --> 02:56.830]  I think that's a good sign.
[02:56.830 --> 03:00.410]  That means the concentrates are working when you're not sure why you're in a different
[03:00.410 --> 03:01.410]  room.
[03:01.410 --> 03:04.050]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thanks for joining me.
[03:04.050 --> 03:05.610]  That's enough talking about hash.
[03:05.610 --> 03:08.310]  Let's move this podcast forward.
[03:08.310 --> 03:12.090]  Let's cover a little bit of business, and then we will get to some emails.
[03:12.090 --> 03:13.290]  It is 420 time.
[03:13.290 --> 03:16.710]  That means it's time for the 420 sale at the Hella Dank Seed Company.

[04:58.270 --> 05:02.070]  Ladies and gentlemen, I think that's all the ads for this episode.
[05:02.070 --> 05:03.430]  Let's move forward with the podcast.
[05:03.430 --> 05:05.350]  I have got great news.
[05:05.350 --> 05:11.690]  If you used to listen to a podcast called The Spliff Podcast, that's The Spliff, S-P-L-I-F-F,
[05:11.690 --> 05:17.210]  and it is the podcast, P-O-T-C-A-S-T, The Spliff Podcast, hosted by Bo Nellis, if you
[05:17.210 --> 05:20.610]  were a fan of that, you'd probably been missing the show.
[05:20.610 --> 05:22.650]  She's been gone for quite a while.
[05:22.650 --> 05:24.030]  But I've got good news.
[05:24.030 --> 05:25.650]  Bo is back in podcasting.
[05:25.650 --> 05:28.370]  She put out an episode a couple of days ago, and it was wonderful.
[05:28.370 --> 05:30.930]  It was so great to hear Bo's voice.
[05:30.930 --> 05:33.250]  As soon as I heard that intro music, I got a smile on my face.
[05:33.250 --> 05:34.690]  I hit play, and I heard the little guitar.
[05:35.030 --> 05:37.550]  I was like, oh, there she is.
[05:37.550 --> 05:38.550]  She's back.
[05:38.550 --> 05:41.150]  Those drums come in, and then she's like, hey, everybody.
[05:41.150 --> 05:43.350]  It's so good to hear her voice.
[05:43.350 --> 05:44.350]  I love Bo's podcast.
[05:44.350 --> 05:47.830]  It is a completely different style of podcasting than what I deliver.
[05:47.830 --> 05:50.110]  It is a completely different format.
[05:50.110 --> 05:55.070]  It is cannabis-based, yes, but she has a completely different approach to cannabis than I do.
[05:55.070 --> 05:59.590]  She talks more about the effects and more about the California scene.
[05:59.590 --> 06:05.650]  Also, she's a woman, so there's a different approach just in the tone of the show.
[06:05.650 --> 06:07.050]  I've got this dude voice, right?
[06:07.050 --> 06:08.370]  I've got a lot of energy.
[06:08.370 --> 06:10.890]  She kind of talks like a kindergarten teacher.
[06:10.890 --> 06:12.210]  I say that with all due respect.
[06:12.210 --> 06:13.650]  Bo, I love your show.
[06:13.650 --> 06:18.770]  I love it because it feels like my preschool teacher or my kindergarten teacher sitting
[06:18.770 --> 06:22.210]  on a little stool in the class while I'm sitting Indian-style.
[06:22.210 --> 06:23.890]  She's like, gather around, class.
[06:23.890 --> 06:25.890]  Today we're going to learn about cannabinoids.
[06:25.890 --> 06:26.890]  I love it.
[06:26.890 --> 06:28.690]  Today we're going to learn about terpenes.
[06:28.790 --> 06:31.270]  I fucking love the way Bo delivers her podcast.
[06:31.270 --> 06:32.270]  I love her product.
[06:32.270 --> 06:33.270]  So, big shout out to Bo.
[06:33.270 --> 06:34.270]  I'm glad you're back.
[06:34.270 --> 06:38.510]  You guys, if you're not listening to the Spliff podcast, you're missing something and you
[06:38.510 --> 06:40.470]  should give it a chance.
[06:40.470 --> 06:41.750]  All right.
[06:41.750 --> 06:44.830]  I think that's all we've got before we can get into some emails.
[06:44.830 --> 06:45.990]  I've covered all the business.
[06:45.990 --> 06:47.550]  I said shout out to Bo.
[06:47.550 --> 06:49.990]  Yeah, you guys, let's get into some emails.
[06:49.990 --> 06:52.230]  I like to answer emails from my listeners.
[06:52.230 --> 06:56.910]  If you would like to send me an email, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[06:56.910 --> 06:57.910]  Send me an email.
[06:58.130 --> 07:01.650]  You may read your email on a future podcast.
[07:01.650 --> 07:03.730]  So this one goes like this.
[07:03.730 --> 07:06.990]  Also you guys, when you send me an email, let me know if you want me to say your name
[07:06.990 --> 07:11.690]  on the show or not, because oftentimes I don't know if I'm supposed to say your name.
[07:11.690 --> 07:14.810]  And I'd like to, if you want me to say your name, I'd like to give you a shout out, but
[07:14.810 --> 07:18.730]  I don't want to call you out and get you in trouble, also make you uncomfortable or anything
[07:18.730 --> 07:19.730]  like that.
[07:19.730 --> 07:22.210]  So let me know and I will follow your guidance.
[07:22.210 --> 07:24.050]  All right, let's get right into this email.
[07:24.050 --> 07:25.570]  I apologize for that microphone sound here.
[07:25.590 --> 07:28.110]  I'm trying to get the mic out of my face so I can read.
[07:28.110 --> 07:29.950]  This email goes like this.
[07:29.950 --> 07:36.250]  Okay, sir, I oversee 288 plants in a drain to waste hydro commercial grow.
[07:36.250 --> 07:40.090]  Our feed schedule has us adding A and B every single day.
[07:40.090 --> 07:41.870]  We are not allowed to change the schedule.
[07:41.870 --> 07:44.330]  We must follow it to AT.
[07:44.330 --> 07:49.710]  But for my own personal grow, should I assume that I need to add A and B every single day?
[07:49.710 --> 07:54.210]  Add A and B until the plants tell us it's good, then possibly every other day?
[07:54.210 --> 07:55.350]  All right.
[07:55.350 --> 07:59.530]  If you're growing in cocoa, I would recommend that you just keep giving it nutrients every
[07:59.630 --> 08:00.710]  day.
[08:00.710 --> 08:03.070]  Cocoa does not hold on to the nutrients.
[08:03.070 --> 08:04.070]  They fall right through.
[08:04.070 --> 08:11.310]  There's a lot of science I could go into on that with low cation exchange and ionic bond,
[08:11.310 --> 08:12.350]  but we're not going to go there.
[08:12.350 --> 08:16.410]  That's just too much talk to confuse people.
[08:16.410 --> 08:17.730]  Nothing sticks to that cocoa.
[08:17.730 --> 08:20.350]  So you do need to use A and B every day.
[08:20.350 --> 08:23.770]  I would also use some sort of a booster.
[08:23.770 --> 08:25.610]  You're going to need CalMag in there.
[08:25.610 --> 08:28.550]  If you're in flower, you're going to need a bloom booster.
[08:28.570 --> 08:31.310]  You're also going to need maybe some Epsom salts once a week.
[08:31.310 --> 08:35.670]  So I would do A and B every day, and then I would make a list of the boosts that you're
[08:35.670 --> 08:36.670]  going to use.
[08:36.670 --> 08:41.870]  Like, if you're going to use a bloom booster, a sweetener, like some carbs, some enzymes,
[08:41.870 --> 08:48.210]  some silicates, maybe a root inoculate, maybe some CalMag, and possibly some Epsom salts.
[08:48.210 --> 08:50.070]  I would make a list of that stuff.
[08:50.070 --> 08:52.510]  And on day one, feed at the top of that list.
[08:52.510 --> 08:54.350]  You got your A and B plus your CalMag.
[08:54.350 --> 08:57.390]  On day two, you got your A and B plus your enzymes.
[08:57.390 --> 09:00.390]  On day three, you got your A and B plus your bud booster.
[09:00.390 --> 09:01.390]  And just go down that list.
[09:01.390 --> 09:04.790]  And when you get to the bottom, go back up to the top and just cycle through that list.
[09:04.790 --> 09:07.870]  And then that way you can add some other things to it instead of just the A and B. And that
[09:07.870 --> 09:10.630]  way you're not overdosing them or overfeeding them anything.
[09:10.630 --> 09:12.550]  If you want to mix a few things in there, you can.
[09:12.550 --> 09:13.890]  Mix what they need.
[09:13.890 --> 09:16.630]  But I would give it A and B every single day.
[09:16.630 --> 09:21.550]  If there's not nutrients, if there are not nutrients in the soil or in the cocoa, the
[09:21.550 --> 09:22.550]  plants can't eat.
[09:22.550 --> 09:26.470]  And if they can't eat, they're not producing to their highest level.
[09:27.470 --> 09:31.990]  As long as you are pH-ing everything and you're not getting a salt buildup and you're not
[09:31.990 --> 09:35.470]  overfeeding, you should be able to feed A and B every day.
[09:35.470 --> 09:38.150]  Now there is a second part to the email that I need to address.
[09:38.150 --> 09:44.430]  He says, also, the pH window I usually work with is 5.8 to 6.2.
[09:44.430 --> 09:48.870]  We are told that we must, and he put must in capitals, so they fucking mean it.
[09:48.870 --> 09:53.390]  We are told that we must fluctuate by 0.1 every single day.
[09:53.390 --> 10:01.860]  Is it a benefit to hit every pH point or just keeping pH at 6 is good to go?
[10:01.860 --> 10:05.540]  I would stick with 6.3 or 6.4.
[10:05.540 --> 10:08.580]  You're a little bit too low at 5.8 to 6.2.
[10:08.580 --> 10:09.700]  I would come up.
[10:09.700 --> 10:15.940]  I would go 6.2 at my lowest and 6.5 at my absolute highest, but I would rather be at
[10:15.940 --> 10:18.180]  6.3 or 6.4.
[10:18.180 --> 10:21.420]  We mix a lot of nutrients at my large facilities.
[10:21.420 --> 10:24.380]  I run two grows for three rivers.
[10:24.460 --> 10:33.660]  We mix 150, about 200, another 180-ish, like 350, 450, 500-something gallons.
[10:33.660 --> 10:37.900]  There's 500-something gallons of flowering nutrients mixed in one room and then easily
[10:37.900 --> 10:40.340]  500 gallons mixed in another.
[10:40.340 --> 10:44.620]  We get the pH to 6.3 or 6.4, whatever we designate.
[10:44.620 --> 10:46.980]  We dial it in on the fucking money.
[10:46.980 --> 10:48.140]  It's not that hard.
[10:48.140 --> 10:52.680]  You have to have a pH pen and some patience and a bottle of pH down.
[10:52.680 --> 10:57.360]  If it's going to start off too high, put in a capful, give it a good stir, test it,
[10:57.360 --> 10:58.360]  see what happens.
[10:58.360 --> 11:00.520]  Now start putting in drops until you get where you want it.
[11:00.520 --> 11:04.120]  Go slow and get it to 6.3 or 6.4.
[11:04.120 --> 11:05.120]  Don't overdo it.
[11:05.120 --> 11:07.760]  All right, now I would move the pH up.
[11:07.760 --> 11:08.760]  That's the first thing I would do.
[11:08.760 --> 11:12.200]  Now you're told that you must fluctuate by 0.1 every single day.
[11:12.200 --> 11:13.240]  Why?
[11:13.240 --> 11:15.040]  I want to know why they think that.
[11:15.040 --> 11:16.040]  Why?
[11:16.040 --> 11:17.640]  Why do you need fluctuation?
[11:17.640 --> 11:18.640]  Plants love consistency.
[11:18.640 --> 11:20.400]  We are building automated systems.
[11:20.400 --> 11:23.520]  We are building all these things on timers.
[11:23.520 --> 11:25.000]  Everything is attached to a timer.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.440]  Everything has got some sort of a schedule.
[11:26.440 --> 11:27.680]  We show up at a certain time.
[11:27.680 --> 11:29.160]  You eat breakfast at a certain time.
[11:29.160 --> 11:32.520]  You get lunch at a certain time.
[11:32.520 --> 11:33.520]  Consistency is key.
[11:33.520 --> 11:37.420]  I'm not sure why we would change the pH by 0.1 every single day.
[11:37.420 --> 11:39.360]  There is no benefit to that, in my opinion.
[11:39.360 --> 11:40.720]  I don't see the reason.
[11:40.720 --> 11:45.520]  I would adjust it to the proper pH where the plants can absorb the nutrients and everything
[11:45.520 --> 11:48.120]  works well on purpose every day.
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.540]  Why would you change that?
[11:50.180 --> 11:54.020]  Without trying to go too far into pH, I don't have any notes on this.
[11:54.020 --> 11:55.180]  I wasn't going to rant on this.
[11:55.180 --> 11:56.340]  This is a side rant.
[11:56.340 --> 12:01.460]  This is a general idea of how pH works.
[12:01.460 --> 12:06.620]  Certain nutrients are available to the plants at certain pH levels.
[12:06.620 --> 12:11.740]  If you drew a half circle chart, I guess we'd go the other way.
[12:11.740 --> 12:12.740]  We'd go up.
[12:12.740 --> 12:14.300]  You've got an up graph, a graph that's a half circle.
[12:14.300 --> 12:15.300]  It looks like a sunrise.
[12:15.300 --> 12:17.820]  You've got the sunrise, a half circle going up.
[12:17.820 --> 12:22.100]  Some nutrients are absorbable at pH around 5.8.
[12:22.100 --> 12:26.220]  Some nutrients are most absorbable at pH around 6.8.
[12:26.220 --> 12:30.500]  We have found that almost everything will be absorbed right around 6.2.
[12:30.500 --> 12:32.260]  That's where you can get everything.
[12:32.260 --> 12:34.180]  You may not get one nutrient the best.
[12:34.180 --> 12:38.820]  You may not get the other nutrient the best, but you'll get everything efficiently, everything
[12:38.820 --> 12:42.220]  at 6.2, 6.3, 6.4.
[12:42.220 --> 12:43.600]  That's when you start getting it all.
[12:43.600 --> 12:45.820]  If you go too high, some things aren't available.
[12:45.820 --> 12:48.820]  If you go too low, other things are not available.
[12:48.820 --> 12:51.500]  Everything is efficiently available around 6.3.
[12:51.500 --> 12:53.340]  That's why we lock it in there.
[12:53.340 --> 12:55.940]  Now, also, here's what's going to happen.
[12:55.940 --> 12:58.860]  Your plants are going to go from freshly watered.
[12:58.860 --> 13:00.940]  We're going to call that freshly watered.
[13:00.940 --> 13:02.140]  That's heavy, right?
[13:02.140 --> 13:03.300]  That's as wet as they're going to get.
[13:03.300 --> 13:05.540]  Now, your pH is going to be at one state.
[13:05.540 --> 13:08.540]  Now, when you leave, they're going to start drying up.
[13:08.540 --> 13:11.260]  As they get drier, the pH is going to change.
[13:11.260 --> 13:18.300]  The pH level in your cocoa, in your rhizosphere, is constantly changing based on the amount
[13:18.300 --> 13:22.280]  of moisture, based on the temperature, the amount of oxygen.
[13:22.280 --> 13:25.620]  That is all affecting your pH inside your rhizosphere.
[13:25.620 --> 13:28.400]  That stands for potential hydrogen.
[13:28.400 --> 13:30.860]  Think about if you've got your pot.
[13:30.860 --> 13:32.180]  Let's find a vessel.
[13:32.180 --> 13:36.860]  If this is your pot, this is where all of your cocoa is, you stick a meter in there,
[13:36.860 --> 13:38.420]  there's so much potential hydrogen.
[13:38.580 --> 13:43.500]  Now watch, if I add this pen, I have already changed your amount of potential hydrogen
[13:43.500 --> 13:48.460]  because you had, if this was 100% full of hydrogen, not anymore because you have to
[13:48.460 --> 13:49.980]  deduct for the pen.
[13:49.980 --> 13:54.020]  So every, I should have put something wet in here so that it could dry.
[13:54.020 --> 13:56.060]  If I spit into here, we've just changed the pH.
[13:56.060 --> 14:00.540]  Now, as my spit dries up, you can see the amount of space disappearing that my spit
[14:00.540 --> 14:02.220]  is taking up, so the pH will change.
[14:02.220 --> 14:03.940]  The water is going to do that.
[14:03.940 --> 14:05.140]  The moisture is going to do that.
[14:05.140 --> 14:09.260]  The pH is going to change in your rhizosphere constantly.
[14:09.260 --> 14:15.160]  So you make it at 6.3, and as it fluctuates, it will do that 0.1 adjustment for you as
[14:15.160 --> 14:16.340]  time goes on.
[14:16.340 --> 14:19.100]  I hope that made sense the way that I did that.
[14:19.100 --> 14:21.860]  I took a container, dropped a pen lid into it.
[14:21.860 --> 14:25.620]  You can't have as much hydrogen in there because now you're taking up space from the lid, right?
[14:25.620 --> 14:27.980]  So that's what the oxygen does.
[14:27.980 --> 14:29.060]  That's what the water does.
[14:29.060 --> 14:31.140]  It changes the pH in your rhizosphere.
[14:31.140 --> 14:32.660]  I hope that makes sense the way I said it.
[14:32.660 --> 14:37.580]  So no, there is no benefit to changing your pH every day.
[14:37.580 --> 14:39.940]  Consistency is key in a large-scale grow.
[14:39.940 --> 14:45.860]  Man, congratulations on the position in a 288 plant drained away system.
[14:45.860 --> 14:46.860]  That's cool.
[14:46.860 --> 14:48.820]  I'm glad you were able to get yourself into the industry.
[14:48.820 --> 14:55.260]  Yes, you do need to feed A and B every day, and I would work some other things into there.
[14:55.260 --> 14:59.460]  Do not fluctuate your pH so much, and try to get it closer to 6.3.
[14:59.460 --> 15:00.460]  That's what I would do.
[15:00.460 --> 15:01.460]  All right.
[15:02.260 --> 15:05.420]  I know that you're not able to change that in your commercial grow.
[15:05.420 --> 15:09.780]  Maybe you can just put this podcast on and put it on repeat, and maybe the people that
[15:09.780 --> 15:14.020]  are in charge will walk by and they'll hear that, and then ask them, why do I want it
[15:14.020 --> 15:15.020]  to fluctuate?
[15:15.020 --> 15:16.020]  I would ask why.
[15:16.020 --> 15:17.020]  Are you a person that asks why?
[15:17.020 --> 15:18.020]  Don't be afraid.
[15:18.020 --> 15:19.020]  You look like you're trying to learn.
[15:19.020 --> 15:22.500]  Just be like, hey, why do I want to do it differently every day?
[15:22.500 --> 15:26.340]  Something that I like in a large facility is to train everybody to do everything the
[15:26.340 --> 15:29.780]  same way every day because I'm off for the next two days.
[15:29.780 --> 15:33.980]  I will not be there, but I need to know that the things are happening the same way that
[15:33.980 --> 15:35.460]  they would if I were there.
[15:35.460 --> 15:37.500]  I just need to know that it's happening.
[15:37.500 --> 15:40.180]  We train everybody to do everything the same every day.
[15:40.180 --> 15:41.180]  We take notes.
[15:41.180 --> 15:42.180]  We write it down.
[15:42.180 --> 15:43.180]  We use Google documents.
[15:43.180 --> 15:46.500]  I know what everybody fed every plant today because there's a Google spreadsheet that
[15:46.500 --> 15:47.740]  says, hey, I gave room A this.
[15:47.740 --> 15:49.860]  I gave room B this.
[15:49.860 --> 15:55.000]  We try to keep track, so I don't see why you would want to vary and deviate.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.140]  Keep it fucking consistent.
[15:57.140 --> 15:58.140]  So much better.
[15:58.140 --> 15:59.140]  All right.
[15:59.500 --> 16:03.020]  You guys, once again, if you'd like to send me an email, my email address is growfromyourheart
[16:03.020 --> 16:04.420]  at hotmail.com.
[16:04.420 --> 16:07.140]  I would love to answer your emails.
[16:07.140 --> 16:08.140]  Ask me some questions.
[16:08.140 --> 16:09.140]  All right.
[16:09.140 --> 16:10.140]  Here's another email.
[16:10.140 --> 16:13.820]  This person does not say if they want me to use their email or say their name or not.
[16:13.820 --> 16:15.460]  Anyway, the email goes like this.
[16:15.460 --> 16:17.180]  Top of the day to you, Rasta Jeff.
[16:17.180 --> 16:18.340]  Question for you.
[16:18.340 --> 16:21.100]  Which way do you personally prefer to trim?
[16:21.100 --> 16:22.140]  Wet or dry?
[16:22.140 --> 16:23.820]  And would you mind explaining why?
[16:23.820 --> 16:24.820]  I love the plant.
[16:24.820 --> 16:27.460]  However, I personally do not use these days.
[16:27.460 --> 16:29.380]  I grow for my family and friends.
[16:29.380 --> 16:31.580]  I appreciate your time and advice.
[16:31.580 --> 16:35.180]  Your podcast contains a plethora of knowledge, and I enjoy tuning in.
[16:35.180 --> 16:37.180]  Thanks for all that you do.
[16:37.180 --> 16:39.900]  Wow, that's a lot of great stuff right there.
[16:39.900 --> 16:41.400]  First of all, you are welcome.
[16:41.400 --> 16:43.620]  Thanks for noticing that I do a lot of stuff.
[16:43.620 --> 16:45.120]  Thanks for the compliment.
[16:45.120 --> 16:46.120]  Thanks for the email.
[16:46.120 --> 16:47.120]  You're very welcome.
[16:47.120 --> 16:52.420]  First, he says, or they say, I don't know if this is a man or a woman or both since
[16:52.420 --> 16:53.780]  it's 2018.
[16:53.780 --> 16:55.500]  They say, question for you.
[16:55.500 --> 16:57.420]  Which way do you personally prefer to trim?
[16:57.420 --> 16:59.620]  Wet or dry?
[16:59.620 --> 17:03.820]  I prefer, after many years of experimenting and wasting a lot of time, I have learned
[17:03.820 --> 17:05.580]  that I prefer dry trim.
[17:05.580 --> 17:10.300]  Dry trim is, it's easier, it's more efficient, it's less time consuming, it's less of a pain
[17:10.300 --> 17:11.780]  in the ass.
[17:11.780 --> 17:16.300]  And in a commercial environment, it's more, it makes a lot more sense.
[17:16.300 --> 17:17.300]  And I'll explain that.
[17:17.300 --> 17:19.140]  I just want to make sure I cover the whole email.
[17:19.140 --> 17:20.460]  I love the plant.
[17:20.460 --> 17:22.740]  I love the plant too, and I'm glad you're on our team.
[17:22.740 --> 17:25.460]  You say, however, I personally do not use these days.
[17:25.460 --> 17:26.740]  You grow for family and friends.
[17:26.740 --> 17:27.740]  Hey, that's cool.
[17:27.740 --> 17:30.700]  You're not even consuming the product, but you've got a passion for growing it.
[17:30.700 --> 17:31.700]  That's awesome.
[17:31.700 --> 17:32.700]  Everybody needs a good grower.
[17:32.700 --> 17:35.820]  Then you say you appreciate my time and advice.
[17:35.820 --> 17:36.820]  You're very welcome.
[17:36.820 --> 17:38.860]  I'm glad you sent me an email to say thank you.
[17:38.860 --> 17:42.220]  And then you say the podcast contains a plethora of knowledge and you enjoy tuning in.
[17:42.220 --> 17:43.940]  That makes everything worth it.
[17:43.940 --> 17:46.380]  So I'm glad you are getting a plethora of knowledge.
[17:46.380 --> 17:47.380]  Keep tuning in.
[17:47.380 --> 17:52.700]  Now let's talk about why I prefer wet or dry trim.
[17:52.700 --> 17:55.540]  Wet trim is kind of a crucial thing.
[17:55.540 --> 17:57.080]  That's like we cut down the plant.
[17:57.080 --> 17:59.300]  If we're going to wet trim it, we got to fucking wet trim it.
[17:59.300 --> 18:00.300]  Now is the time.
[18:00.300 --> 18:01.300]  You got to go.
[18:01.300 --> 18:02.460]  You're under the gun.
[18:02.460 --> 18:03.860]  There's no mistakes.
[18:03.860 --> 18:05.600]  There's lots of pressure.
[18:05.600 --> 18:07.780]  You can't stop until you're finished.
[18:07.780 --> 18:10.100]  You just have to trim.
[18:10.100 --> 18:11.860]  And then it's kind of, it's super sticky.
[18:11.860 --> 18:13.540]  It's kind of a pain in the ass also.
[18:13.540 --> 18:15.180]  It's so sticky.
[18:15.180 --> 18:16.820]  I like dry trimming.
[18:16.820 --> 18:22.020]  The way that I like to do it is just before harvest, I will go take off all of the big
[18:22.340 --> 18:23.340]  leaves, all the leaves with the petiole.
[18:23.340 --> 18:27.220]  They get snapped right off the plant several days before harvest.
[18:27.220 --> 18:29.220]  Then we continue flushing.
[18:29.220 --> 18:33.300]  Then on harvest day, cut down the plants and hang them upside down.
[18:33.300 --> 18:35.980]  Now you've just got plants hanging upside down.
[18:35.980 --> 18:37.820]  They will start to get crunchy.
[18:37.820 --> 18:43.740]  Once the stems pop, once they start popping, when you bend them, crunch, then I will put
[18:43.740 --> 18:45.300]  them into bins.
[18:45.300 --> 18:50.180]  I will cut the main part of the stick out and then I'll leave a bunch of stick in there,
[18:50.180 --> 18:54.060]  but I'll put them into big Rubbermaid or Tupperware bins.
[18:54.060 --> 18:58.580]  They are two feet long by a foot wide and about 18 inches tall.
[18:58.580 --> 19:00.420]  Those are the Rubbermaid bins I like to use.
[19:00.420 --> 19:04.880]  I can fit a couple of plants in there, maybe three or four plants the size I grow them.
[19:04.880 --> 19:06.260]  So I put the dry plants in there.
[19:06.260 --> 19:09.720]  I cut out a lot of the big stick, but I leave some of it because there's moisture in there
[19:09.720 --> 19:11.780]  that's going to come into play.
[19:11.780 --> 19:15.760]  So I have, excuse me, I have plants that kind of, kind of snap.
[19:15.760 --> 19:17.980]  Now they've gone into these Rubbermaid containers.
[19:17.980 --> 19:20.000]  Then I will put the lid on them.
[19:20.820 --> 19:22.600]  It's a good idea to wrap them in butcher paper.
[19:22.600 --> 19:25.040]  Just put one good wrap of butcher paper around them.
[19:25.040 --> 19:28.240]  That will absorb any excess water that wants to come out.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.360]  That'll help you.
[19:29.360 --> 19:31.440]  So lock them in there, seal them up.
[19:31.440 --> 19:36.320]  Then once a day, just go in there and open that container and let out all the funky air.
[19:36.320 --> 19:38.960]  Spin them around so where the buds that were on the bottom are now on the top.
[19:38.960 --> 19:42.180]  Leave them open for a few minutes and close them again.
[19:42.180 --> 19:45.640]  Now you've got dried buds that are basically just drying and curing.
[19:45.640 --> 19:50.240]  Now you can go in at any time and get one of those Rubbermaid containers and just carry
[19:50.240 --> 19:52.300]  it out to the table and just start trimming.
[19:52.300 --> 19:54.480]  You can dry trim that product whenever.
[19:54.480 --> 19:59.080]  It's going to stay in there dried and cured in stasis forever until it gets ridiculously
[19:59.080 --> 20:00.080]  dry.
[20:00.080 --> 20:03.600]  But if you seal it up and put it in a room with humidity control, we keep it in a room
[20:03.600 --> 20:06.720]  with a dehumidifier and a humidifier on.
[20:06.720 --> 20:11.520]  They fight each other all day, but we keep that room 50% humidity constantly.
[20:11.520 --> 20:15.520]  You'll hear that dehumidifier click off and two seconds later, here comes the humidifier.
[20:15.520 --> 20:18.200]  Click it, it hit 52% and then they battle.
[20:18.200 --> 20:20.680]  And then it'll go down to 49% and the other one will come on.
[20:20.680 --> 20:23.360]  So it's constantly 50% in that room.
[20:23.360 --> 20:26.920]  But that's what keeps our buds at just the right squishiness, just the right texture.
[20:26.920 --> 20:30.960]  We keep them in the container, sealed, but a little bit of that moisture exchanges.
[20:30.960 --> 20:31.960]  You can't keep it.
[20:31.960 --> 20:33.080]  They're not all airtight.
[20:33.080 --> 20:35.780]  So we keep them in that room and they get perfect.
[20:35.780 --> 20:38.760]  So we cut them down, let them get to where they snap.
[20:38.760 --> 20:41.000]  Once they snap, we put them in the containers.
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  Then you can just open them up and dry trim them whenever.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.840]  You can cut the buds off the sticks and you can trim them up by hand.
[20:45.840 --> 20:49.800]  You can hold the bud in your hand and knock the leaves off with your thumb.
[20:49.800 --> 20:52.680]  Just use your thumb just like you're playing a video game or just use little, like it's
[20:52.680 --> 20:55.060]  little thumb scissors and just knock the leaves off.
[20:55.060 --> 20:57.160]  It's not nearly as sticky.
[20:57.160 --> 20:58.880]  It's not nearly as messy.
[20:58.880 --> 21:00.360]  It's not as much of a pain in the ass.
[21:00.360 --> 21:02.200]  You won't go through as many gloves.
[21:02.200 --> 21:05.920]  And also as you're dry trimming, you can take those dried buds and just throw them right
[21:05.920 --> 21:09.680]  into the bag because that's ready for retail, ready for packaging, ready for whatever you're
[21:09.680 --> 21:10.840]  going to do with it.
[21:10.840 --> 21:13.560]  And then you've got this little pile of trim that you can turn into whatever you're going
[21:13.560 --> 21:14.760]  to do with that.
[21:14.760 --> 21:18.080]  And you can weigh that finished product as soon as you're done trimming it.
[21:18.080 --> 21:21.760]  So if you're paying your trimmer by weight, if you say, Hey, I'll give you this much per
[21:21.760 --> 21:24.240]  pound, then he's got dry trim.
[21:24.240 --> 21:27.160]  He's just pulling it off, trimming it up, throw it in a bucket, trimming it off, throw
[21:27.160 --> 21:28.720]  it in a bucket, trim it off, throw it in a bucket.
[21:28.720 --> 21:32.320]  And then at the end of the day, you can put that dry product on the scale and you can
[21:32.320 --> 21:36.000]  see how much they actually did trim with wet product.
[21:36.000 --> 21:37.000]  It's wet.
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  You don't know how much is there.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.960]  So you can see how much of that product did dry up 30, 50, 75%, maybe 80%, depending on
[21:41.960 --> 21:45.200]  how soon before harvest it got watered.
[21:45.200 --> 21:47.280]  So I like dry trim.
[21:47.280 --> 21:48.280]  It's less of a rush.
[21:48.280 --> 21:50.160]  It's less of a fiasco.
[21:50.160 --> 21:51.960]  It's less of a, there's less pressure.
[21:51.960 --> 21:54.600]  You don't have to just, you're not under the gun as much.
[21:54.600 --> 21:57.020]  There's not as much of a deadline with the dry trim.
[21:57.020 --> 21:58.760]  You can just seal them up in containers.
[21:58.760 --> 22:01.360]  And as long as they're sealed, they're going to stay the way that they are.
[22:01.360 --> 22:03.000]  You can just trim them up when you need them.
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.200]  So maybe, maybe you don't have anywhere for that product to go.
[22:06.200 --> 22:07.880]  Maybe you don't have a patient that needs it.
[22:07.880 --> 22:09.080]  Maybe you're not hustling it.
[22:09.080 --> 22:10.080]  Maybe you're not flipping it.
[22:10.080 --> 22:11.080]  Maybe you don't have time to trim it.
[22:11.080 --> 22:13.120]  You can just sit there, dry it as long as it's sealed up.
[22:13.120 --> 22:15.080]  You can just sit there with the leaves on it.
[22:15.080 --> 22:16.320]  So that's partly why I like it.
[22:16.320 --> 22:17.800]  And it's just less messy.
[22:17.800 --> 22:19.600]  It's less, it is not as sticky.
[22:19.600 --> 22:21.360]  It's not as much of a pain in the ass.
[22:21.360 --> 22:22.880]  So that's why I prefer dry trim.
[22:22.880 --> 22:25.480]  It makes more sense to me.
[22:25.480 --> 22:30.080]  Mike and I used to wet trim for hours and we would be at it all night wet trimming.
[22:30.080 --> 22:33.400]  We would start trimming after work or whenever, because you can't trim during the day when
[22:33.400 --> 22:34.400]  everyone's around.
[22:34.400 --> 22:37.560]  You got to wait until the nighttime when people are kind of low key because it fucking stinks.
[22:37.560 --> 22:39.080]  And then you got to be in it for hours.
[22:39.080 --> 22:43.840]  So we'd start trimming in the evenings and we'd go until sunrise and then try to go to
[22:43.840 --> 22:45.760]  work the next day, half exhausted.
[22:45.760 --> 22:47.080]  We wore ourselves out wet trimming.
[22:47.080 --> 22:48.620]  We would be super sticky.
[22:48.620 --> 22:52.000]  We would over trim because you trim it and that blood dries up and it shrinks.
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.320]  And a lot of those leaves you trimmed off would have just shrunk up.
[22:54.320 --> 22:56.080]  You wouldn't even have seen it anyway.
[22:56.080 --> 22:58.200]  So yeah, dry trim is better in my opinion.
[22:58.200 --> 23:02.320]  In most commercial applications that are doing dry trim because it's such a rush, there's
[23:02.320 --> 23:05.200]  such a deadline and it's such a fiasco to do wet trim.
[23:05.320 --> 23:07.920]  So dry trim is the way to go in my opinion.
[23:07.920 --> 23:10.840]  Once those buds are dried and trimmed up, you can already weigh them also.
[23:10.840 --> 23:11.840]  So that feels good.
[23:11.840 --> 23:14.520]  It's nice to know it's like chip, chip, chip, chip, chip, chip, chip, two pounds.
[23:14.520 --> 23:15.520]  Cool.
[23:15.520 --> 23:16.520]  I did that.
[23:16.520 --> 23:17.520]  It just feels good.
[23:17.520 --> 23:18.520]  And I said two pounds.
[23:18.520 --> 23:22.800]  Don't don't kill yourself if you can't trim two pounds in a day.
[23:22.800 --> 23:23.800]  One is good.
[23:23.800 --> 23:24.800]  I hope you can do two.
[23:24.800 --> 23:25.800]  I hope so.
[23:25.800 --> 23:26.800]  But one is cool.
[23:26.800 --> 23:27.960]  All right, you guys, I'm getting off on a ramble here.
[23:27.960 --> 23:29.640]  Hey, thanks for the great email.
[23:29.640 --> 23:33.320]  You guys start including if you want me to say your name on the show or not in your emails
[23:33.320 --> 23:36.240]  because I would like to give this person and the other person a great shout out because
[23:36.240 --> 23:38.260]  they did send me wonderful emails.
[23:38.260 --> 23:43.520]  But I don't want to get anybody in trouble with your job, with your community, with your
[23:43.520 --> 23:46.040]  wife, with your girlfriend, your boyfriend, whatever.
[23:46.040 --> 23:47.600]  Trying to be respectful.
[23:47.600 --> 23:50.240]  So if you want a shout out, let me know and I will hook you up.
[23:50.240 --> 23:53.680]  You guys, if you want me to read your email on the podcast, all you've got to do is send
[23:53.680 --> 23:54.680]  it to me.
[23:54.680 --> 23:55.680]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[23:55.680 --> 23:58.680]  I've got a huge stack of emails I'm working through.

[24:02.280 --> 24:03.280]  heart.
[24:03.280 --> 24:05.400]  Everything you need to know will be right there.
[24:05.400 --> 24:10.520]  All right, you guys, don't forget about the 420 sale at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[24:10.520 --> 24:15.040]  Also, don't forget about the discount code at PL Grow Systems.
[24:15.040 --> 24:17.640]  I'm going to open that up again and make sure that I give you the right coupon code because
[24:17.640 --> 24:18.640]  I don't want to do it wrong.
[24:18.640 --> 24:22.200]  It's GFYH420 at PLGrow.Systems.
[24:22.200 --> 24:23.200]  Make sure you check them out.
[24:23.200 --> 24:26.200]  You guys, I hope everybody has a great 420.
[24:26.200 --> 24:29.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, I would appreciate it if you find me on all of the social media.
[24:29.600 --> 24:31.000]  Check me out on Facebook.
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.320]  On Instagram, I use Ireadgenetics.
[24:35.320 --> 24:38.000]  It's I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.080]  I post a bunch of great cannabis photography.
[24:40.080 --> 24:45.200]  I do Instagram live feeds where I go and hang out with my friends and answer cannabis questions
[24:45.200 --> 24:46.200]  and take dabs.
[24:46.200 --> 24:48.440]  Today, I was on Instagram live with Dabin Granny.
[24:48.440 --> 24:52.400]  We were talking about podcast stuff and dabbing and answering questions for her audience.
[24:52.400 --> 24:53.400]  That was a lot of fun.
[24:53.400 --> 24:54.400]  Shout out to Granny.
[24:54.400 --> 24:55.400]  I love you every day.
[24:55.400 --> 24:56.400]  I miss you.
[24:56.400 --> 24:57.400]  Let's get together.
[24:57.400 --> 24:58.400]  So Instagram live, yeah.
[24:58.400 --> 24:59.400]  Follow me on Instagram.
[24:59.400 --> 25:00.760]  I post a bunch of great cannabis photography.
[25:00.760 --> 25:01.760]  Check out the live feeds.
[25:01.760 --> 25:02.760]  It's a lot of fun.
[25:02.760 --> 25:04.280]  Also, I am on Twitter.
[25:04.280 --> 25:05.720]  You can find the podcast.
[25:05.720 --> 25:07.800]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[25:07.800 --> 25:09.120]  You can find my Twitter.
[25:09.120 --> 25:10.120]  Simply search for Rastajeff420.
[25:10.120 --> 25:11.720]  It's really easy to find.
[25:11.720 --> 25:15.680]  I always retweet all the podcast stuff, so you're probably following me anyway.
[25:15.680 --> 25:18.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to interact with me and you're not into social
[25:18.760 --> 25:22.480]  media, if you've got a product you'd like me to review, if you'd like to sponsor the
[25:22.480 --> 25:26.480]  podcast, or if you've simply got something that you would like to say, you can send me
[25:26.480 --> 25:27.480]  an email.
[25:27.600 --> 25:32.600]  From your heart at Hotmail.com, you know I would love to hear from you.
[25:32.600 --> 25:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I upgraded to a new MacBook.
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.000]  I think you can hear it.
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.160]  The sound quality, recording is easier, editing is easier.
[25:39.160 --> 25:40.600]  It's a lot more fun.
[25:40.600 --> 25:45.400]  Also, it has made it a lot easier to produce the YouTube videos.
[25:45.400 --> 25:50.560]  There are about 250 videos produced and on my YouTube page.
[25:50.560 --> 25:56.320]  I have only released about 230-ish, but they are coming much more quickly now.
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.040]  So I will get caught up way more soon, way sooner than anticipated.
[26:01.040 --> 26:04.320]  I was doing pretty well right up until that point with the English.
[26:04.320 --> 26:05.680]  But I'll get the videos caught up, you guys.
[26:05.680 --> 26:07.020]  Thanks for being patient.
[26:07.020 --> 26:11.600]  If you want to watch old videos and see the old content, go to the YouTube channel.
[26:11.600 --> 26:15.600]  Go to YouTube.com and search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[26:15.600 --> 26:16.680]  You will find me.
[26:16.680 --> 26:18.040]  Go check out the old videos.
[26:18.040 --> 26:19.560]  I would appreciate that.
[26:19.560 --> 26:22.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to remind you about Patreon.
[26:22.200 --> 26:26.120]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks, you can go to Patreon.com
[26:26.120 --> 26:30.160]  slash Grow From Your Heart and you can learn how to financially contribute to the podcast.
[26:30.160 --> 26:32.080]  I mentioned the new MacBook earlier.
[26:32.080 --> 26:35.400]  About half of that was covered by Patreon contributions.
[26:35.400 --> 26:36.400]  Thank you.
[26:36.400 --> 26:37.400]  I couldn't have upgraded.
[26:37.400 --> 26:40.320]  I don't know that the podcast would sound as good as it does without your help.
[26:40.320 --> 26:44.000]  So with Patreon contributions, we were able to cover the new MacBook.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.240]  I also like to cover the cost of the website with the Patreon contributions.
[26:47.240 --> 26:49.080]  I have a website where I host the podcast.
[26:49.080 --> 26:52.080]  That's how I'm able to get the show out to everybody for free.
[26:52.080 --> 26:55.160]  There are some people who are able to contribute to the Patreon campaign.
[26:55.160 --> 26:56.360]  I appreciate you.
[26:56.360 --> 26:59.760]  It's Patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart.
[26:59.760 --> 27:01.140]  Go check it out.
[27:01.140 --> 27:04.480]  If you contribute at certain levels, I do offer certain gifts.
[27:04.480 --> 27:05.480]  Go look.
[27:05.480 --> 27:06.880]  There may be something there that you're interested in.
[27:06.880 --> 27:08.000]  You never know.
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.440]  If there's something you think I should put on there as something I would offer for a
[27:11.440 --> 27:15.960]  contribution, let me know how else I can help you out and we'll see what we can do.
[27:15.960 --> 27:20.640]  All right, you guys, I think that's all the rambling that I've got for you for this week.
[27:20.640 --> 27:23.960]  I will be back Thursday with a Throwback Thursday episode.
[27:23.960 --> 27:26.000]  Tomorrow is the Dude Grows Cup.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.800]  So by the time you listen to this, I will have gone to the Dude Grows Cup in Denver.
[27:30.800 --> 27:34.720]  I will be back Thursday to report on that event and let you know how it goes.
[27:34.720 --> 27:38.080]  I will let you know what I got to smoke on and who I got to hang out with.
[27:38.080 --> 27:40.240]  I'm sure that's going to be a raging good time.
[27:40.240 --> 27:43.320]  I've got a couple other things in Denver that I'm going to go to that I'm not sure I'm allowed
[27:43.320 --> 27:44.800]  to talk about on the podcast.
[27:44.800 --> 27:51.040]  If they give me permission to speak on it, I will certainly share everything that I can.
[27:51.040 --> 27:53.880]  You guys, I'll be back Monday with a brand new episode.
[27:53.880 --> 27:54.880]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[27:54.880 --> 27:57.960]  I made it through the whole show without taking a break or taking a drink.
[27:57.960 --> 27:58.960]  I'm proud of myself.
[27:58.960 --> 27:59.960]  I'm proud of my throat.
[27:59.960 --> 28:02.660]  I'm proud of you guys for hanging out with me and hanging in there.
[28:02.660 --> 28:03.660]  This has been a lot of fun.
[28:03.660 --> 28:07.320]  I truly do appreciate each and every one of you for listening to the podcast.
[28:07.320 --> 28:08.800]  I appreciate if you're listening on iTunes.
[28:08.800 --> 28:10.920]  I appreciate you if you're on Stitcher.
[28:10.920 --> 28:14.000]  I appreciate you if you're on YouTube or however you're listening.
[28:14.200 --> 28:15.200]  Thank you.
[28:15.200 --> 28:16.200]  Thank you for supporting cannabis.
[28:16.200 --> 28:17.200]  Thank you for supporting the podcast.
[28:17.200 --> 28:18.800]  And thank you for supporting me.
[28:18.800 --> 28:19.800]  I appreciate it.
[28:19.800 --> 28:21.880]  I appreciate each and every one of you.
[28:21.880 --> 28:25.160]  You guys, I am a rambly tonight, so I'm going to get out of here before I make this a long
[28:25.160 --> 28:26.160]  podcast.
[28:26.160 --> 28:28.600]  I want to give a huge shout out to Mitzi Shore.
[28:28.600 --> 28:31.760]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
