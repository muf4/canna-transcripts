[02:18.000 --> 02:19.000]  The growers meeting.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.880]  I've been hyping up this big growers meeting at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:22.880 --> 02:28.440]  I'm a dick because I have to announce right now that the growers meeting at Hygro Indoor
[02:28.440 --> 02:30.440]  Growing Supplies has been postponed.
[02:30.440 --> 02:33.200]  It will not be April 26th as I have said before.
[02:33.200 --> 02:34.480]  We're working on a new date.
[02:34.480 --> 02:35.480]  I apologize.
[02:35.840 --> 02:36.840]  It's beyond my control.
[02:36.840 --> 02:37.840]  This is not me.
[02:37.840 --> 02:38.840]  I am only the messenger here.
[02:38.840 --> 02:43.240]  There's a lot going on that I'm not even sure about why it's been changed exactly.
[02:43.240 --> 02:44.760]  There are a lot of circumstances.
[02:44.760 --> 02:45.760]  So it's beyond my control.
[02:45.760 --> 02:47.680]  It's beyond Jesse's control.
[02:47.680 --> 02:48.880]  We all apologize.
[02:48.880 --> 02:53.360]  But the growers meeting at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has been canceled or postponed is
[02:53.360 --> 02:54.480]  a better word.
[02:54.480 --> 02:57.080]  So until you hear another date, I apologize.
[02:57.080 --> 02:58.080]  I sincerely apologize.
[02:58.080 --> 03:00.120]  I was looking forward to meeting you.
[03:00.120 --> 03:02.000]  I had some shit written down.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.720]  Either way, I did write some stuff that I want to talk about on the podcast in a future
[03:05.720 --> 03:06.720]  episode.
[03:06.720 --> 03:11.120]  So I said we're going to talk about grow room scheduling, like planning out a routine and
[03:11.120 --> 03:14.040]  a pattern for your room so that you can have a productive room.
[03:14.040 --> 03:17.560]  I'm still going to write that out completely well, and we'll talk about that on the podcast
[03:17.560 --> 03:18.560]  anyway.
[03:18.560 --> 03:20.040]  All right.
[03:20.040 --> 03:21.560]  So what else did I want to talk about?
[03:21.560 --> 03:22.560]  The Cannabis Cup, right?
[03:22.560 --> 03:23.560]  Let's get down to it.
[03:23.560 --> 03:26.160]  I'm going to drop the music out because that's highly distracting to me.
[03:26.160 --> 03:27.640]  We'll just lower that good enough.
[03:27.640 --> 03:28.640]  There we go.
[03:28.640 --> 03:29.640]  All right.
[03:29.640 --> 03:30.640]  Let's get into the Cannabis Cup.
[03:30.640 --> 03:33.080]  I'm going to go ahead and start because it was a long weekend.
[03:33.080 --> 03:34.920]  I want to try to cover a few things.
[03:34.920 --> 03:36.160]  Oh, excuse me.
[03:36.160 --> 03:37.840]  I'm burping.
[03:37.840 --> 03:43.240]  So the Cannabis Cup was Saturday, Sunday, and Monday in Denver at a place called the
[03:43.240 --> 03:46.280]  Denver Mart.
[03:46.280 --> 03:49.560]  It's off of 58th and Washington or off of 58th Street, 925.
[03:49.560 --> 03:54.080]  It's at 58th and Washington was where most of the action was.
[03:54.080 --> 03:58.480]  There was no, there was a lot of parking, but it was all fucking a clusterfuck.
[03:58.480 --> 04:01.800]  It cost 30 bucks to park in most places.
[04:01.800 --> 04:02.800]  So let me back up.
[04:02.800 --> 04:05.920]  We'll talk about Friday night because Friday night's when it all kind of started for me.
[04:05.920 --> 04:09.200]  You guys heard about my Morgan Heritage concert adventure.
[04:09.200 --> 04:12.800]  And then Thursday I went and got stoned with the reggae bands and hydro, right?
[04:12.800 --> 04:13.980]  So that was the last episode.
[04:13.980 --> 04:17.360]  So I left you guys off on Thursday, Friday night.
[04:17.360 --> 04:20.360]  I packed up, headed to Denver.
[04:20.360 --> 04:21.800]  The weather was terrible.
[04:21.800 --> 04:23.760]  It rained the entire drive to Denver.
[04:23.760 --> 04:24.760]  That's 125 miles.
[04:25.080 --> 04:29.800]  It took me close to two and a half hours just to get to the South end of Denver.
[04:29.800 --> 04:36.280]  I drove to a garden of Wheaton had a, an Airbnb spot just outside of Boulder.
[04:36.280 --> 04:37.800]  I was almost to Boulder.
[04:37.800 --> 04:40.240]  Honestly, I was in Louisville, Colorado.
[04:40.240 --> 04:44.640]  It was a gorgeous little Airbnb house that they got their sweet score, but it was kind
[04:44.640 --> 04:45.840]  of far out of the way for me.
[04:45.840 --> 04:47.080]  Anyway, I drove out there.
[04:47.080 --> 04:49.560]  I got dabbed out with some of the crew from garden of Wheaton.
[04:49.560 --> 04:53.360]  I wanted to meet up with those guys, hang out with them on a Friday night, which I'm
[04:53.360 --> 04:56.300]  glad I did because they've been busy as shit since then.
[04:56.300 --> 04:59.240]  So I hung out, got dabbed out with the garden of Wheaton crew.
[04:59.240 --> 05:00.240]  Then I headed back to the hotel.
[05:00.240 --> 05:02.340]  I got kind of hungry, got kind of tired.
[05:02.340 --> 05:03.340]  So I headed back to the hotel.
[05:03.340 --> 05:04.560]  My hotel was super cozy.
[05:04.560 --> 05:06.240]  It was glad I got that room that I got.
[05:06.240 --> 05:07.240]  It was cheap.
[05:07.240 --> 05:08.240]  So I was a little questioning.
[05:08.240 --> 05:10.360]  I was kind of questioning on what, how it was going to be.
[05:10.360 --> 05:11.560]  There's affordable and it was cozy.
[05:11.560 --> 05:12.760]  It was a great room for one guy.
[05:12.760 --> 05:14.960]  That was a little bed, a couch, a desk, a TV.
[05:14.960 --> 05:16.120]  I barely turned on the TV.
[05:16.120 --> 05:18.080]  I used it as a nightlight mainly.
[05:18.080 --> 05:20.000]  I got some pizza delivered and I went to sleep.
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  I ate the shit out of some pizza.
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.440]  Some local pizza that was around there.
[05:23.440 --> 05:25.280]  And then I went to sleep.
[05:25.280 --> 05:28.760]  Saturday morning I woke up kind of early.
[05:28.760 --> 05:30.160]  I got to the cup around nine.
[05:30.160 --> 05:32.980]  It was about 838.45 when I got to the cup.
[05:32.980 --> 05:37.320]  The parking lots were starting to get full already.
[05:37.320 --> 05:40.760]  But there was one spot I found that was open right away, right near the gate.
[05:40.760 --> 05:45.120]  It cost me 30 bucks to park about 30 feet from the gate that I needed to use.
[05:45.120 --> 05:48.240]  So I parked my car, got myself organized, headed into the cup.
[05:48.240 --> 05:49.640]  It was about nine.
[05:49.640 --> 05:51.060]  I had a vendor wristband.
[05:51.120 --> 05:52.580]  So I was able to get in before everybody else.
[05:52.580 --> 05:54.380]  The event doesn't open until noon.
[05:54.380 --> 05:56.100]  Having the vendor wristband really helped me out.
[05:56.100 --> 05:57.100]  I got in at nine.
[05:57.100 --> 05:59.540]  It was kind of neat to see the Cannabis Cup come together.
[05:59.540 --> 06:04.900]  When I walked in, it was just a bunch of empty spaces with square booths and a bunch of walkways.
[06:04.900 --> 06:08.660]  People were emptying everything out of boxes and everyone was all frantic and moving around.
[06:08.660 --> 06:11.940]  It wasn't the smoke fest that you guys saw, that everybody that went there saw.
[06:11.940 --> 06:13.740]  It was chaos.
[06:13.740 --> 06:15.380]  People looked stressed as shit.
[06:15.380 --> 06:18.140]  So anyway, by noon the place was packed and jumping.
[06:18.220 --> 06:19.220]  I got in early.
[06:19.220 --> 06:22.020]  I immediately started linking up with people that I know.
[06:22.020 --> 06:24.620]  It only took me a few seconds to walk in and see people that I know.
[06:24.620 --> 06:26.980]  Also, I need to give a big shout out to Robert and Anita.
[06:26.980 --> 06:30.540]  I don't know if they listen to the podcast or not, but I have some friends that are local
[06:30.540 --> 06:33.380]  friends I bumped into.
[06:33.380 --> 06:37.220]  So there's a big ass line outside the cup, right?
[06:37.220 --> 06:39.500]  There was a vendor entrance and I just walked right in it.
[06:39.500 --> 06:41.420]  Nobody asked me for any credentials.
[06:41.420 --> 06:43.300]  I never showed a wristband.
[06:43.300 --> 06:44.300]  I never showed an ID.
[06:44.300 --> 06:45.300]  I never showed a ticket.
[06:45.300 --> 06:48.860]  I just walked right in that son of a bitch, right past everybody, right into the thing.
[06:48.860 --> 06:53.060]  I was in the cannabis cup at 9 a.m. while everybody else was waiting in line.
[06:53.060 --> 06:54.460]  And so I'm a kind guy.
[06:54.460 --> 06:57.620]  I had bumped into Robert and Anita while I was in line or while I was walking from the
[06:57.620 --> 06:58.620]  car.
[06:58.620 --> 06:59.620]  I saw them.
[06:59.620 --> 07:00.620]  They were going to actually use a porta potty.
[07:00.620 --> 07:02.420]  And I thought, well, should I saw my friends?
[07:02.420 --> 07:03.780]  I should call them and tell them about this.
[07:03.780 --> 07:07.660]  So I invited them to come join me and I met them over by another area that was inside
[07:07.660 --> 07:10.580]  the event and then they walked around with me for a little while and hung out.
[07:10.580 --> 07:11.580]  So that was fun.
[07:11.580 --> 07:12.580]  Yeah.
[07:12.580 --> 07:16.580]  So big shout out to Robert and Anita for keeping me company for the first part of the
[07:16.580 --> 07:17.580]  morning there.
[07:17.580 --> 07:18.580]  That was kind of fun.
[07:18.580 --> 07:21.340]  Actually, I knew a lot of people there at the cup and they kind of got annoyed that
[07:21.340 --> 07:24.660]  every 10 feet we would walk, somebody would bump into me and take a picture with us and
[07:24.660 --> 07:25.660]  hang out with them.
[07:25.660 --> 07:26.660]  They wanted to go cannabis cup.
[07:26.660 --> 07:28.180]  So they ditched me, which they didn't really ditch me.
[07:28.180 --> 07:31.420]  They told me they were taking off, which was cool.
[07:31.420 --> 07:34.260]  So Robert and Anita took off and had fun, left me wandering around for myself for a
[07:34.260 --> 07:35.260]  little while.
[07:35.260 --> 07:36.260]  I bumped into so many people.
[07:36.260 --> 07:38.140]  Actually, I went to a booth.
[07:38.140 --> 07:39.140]  I was looking to dab.
[07:39.140 --> 07:45.260]  I wanted to dab and I ran into Johnny B from no goo nonstick and he had a cool booth and
[07:45.260 --> 07:46.260]  he said, what's up?
[07:46.260 --> 07:47.260]  And his crew said hi to me.
[07:47.260 --> 07:52.380]  And at the back of their booth, they shared a booth with some other people and these fellers,
[07:52.380 --> 07:56.780]  uh, man, I feel like a dick right now because there were two brothers that looked fairly,
[07:56.780 --> 07:58.420]  very, very similar.
[07:58.420 --> 07:59.780]  I got them confused multiple times.
[07:59.780 --> 08:03.340]  I learned to buy the end of the weekend, but one dude's name was Ari and there was a brother
[08:03.340 --> 08:07.580]  with dreadlocks and there was another guy that looked very much like Ari.
[08:07.580 --> 08:09.460]  They gave me, you can hear the parchment paper right now.
[08:09.460 --> 08:13.860]  They gave me a little, everyone's given out their shatter and these little envelopes,
[08:13.860 --> 08:18.780]  these little, I think they used to be for coin trading, these little coin envelopes.
[08:18.780 --> 08:23.220]  This one is labeled MOT extractions, cheese, Nug run one gram.
[08:23.220 --> 08:26.620]  So they gave me this and I've still got quite a bit of it left.
[08:26.620 --> 08:30.220]  What I'm gonna do right now for you guys for MOT extractions, I'm going to take a dab of
[08:30.220 --> 08:33.740]  this cheese Nug run and I honestly already know that I love it, but I want to take a
[08:33.740 --> 08:35.540]  dab of it and tell you what, Oh, that's too big.
[08:35.540 --> 08:36.940]  That's not too big of a tab.
[08:36.940 --> 08:37.940]  Let's not do that.
[08:37.940 --> 08:38.940]  Here we go.
[08:38.940 --> 08:40.260]  Let's take this medium sized dab on the show here.
[08:40.260 --> 08:44.720]  We'll talk about some MOT extractions, Nug run.
[08:44.720 --> 08:46.880]  This was the first stab that I took at the cannabis cup.
[08:46.880 --> 08:48.680]  So this was how I walked into the cup.
[08:48.680 --> 08:49.860]  This is what I was introduced with.
[08:49.860 --> 09:03.670]  So I'm going to take a dab of it and we'll talk about it.
[09:03.670 --> 09:04.670]  All right.
[09:04.670 --> 09:07.430]  I took a nice chunky size dab.
[09:07.430 --> 09:08.430]  It wasn't too ridiculous.
[09:08.430 --> 09:09.430]  It was good and chunky though.
[09:09.430 --> 09:10.430]  It was a good dab.
[09:10.430 --> 09:11.430]  There's no cough.
[09:11.430 --> 09:14.630]  So we'll talk about the flavor.
[09:14.630 --> 09:18.270]  The flavor is very smooth.
[09:18.270 --> 09:23.110]  It doesn't taste like cheese to me or the strain the cheese.
[09:23.110 --> 09:28.710]  I get kind of a, there's some sweetness to it and there's a little bit of funk to it.
[09:28.710 --> 09:30.430]  You know, the cheese is setting in now that it's a draw.
[09:30.430 --> 09:32.070]  My tongue is kind of absorbing it a little.
[09:32.070 --> 09:33.150]  The cotton mouth thing is kicking in.
[09:33.150 --> 09:34.630]  I got to take a drink by the way.
[09:34.630 --> 09:36.390]  Ooh, excuse me.
[09:36.390 --> 09:40.360]  Hold on.
[09:40.360 --> 09:41.440]  Okay.
[09:41.440 --> 09:43.840]  There's definitely the hint of the cheese in there.
[09:43.840 --> 09:45.600]  A little funk, a little sour.
[09:45.600 --> 09:46.600]  I like it.
[09:47.080 --> 09:49.480]  I'm definitely going to smoke the rest of this ground that they gave me.
[09:49.480 --> 09:51.560]  I approve you guys.
[09:51.560 --> 09:52.560]  It tastes good.
[09:52.560 --> 09:53.960]  I got a nice mellow Indica high.
[09:53.960 --> 09:55.560]  My eyes got droopy.
[09:55.560 --> 09:58.960]  The appearance, it's super clear.
[09:58.960 --> 10:00.880]  It's a right between shatter and snap.
[10:00.880 --> 10:02.720]  You know, I've had it for several days here.
[10:02.720 --> 10:05.840]  It was in my car for a day and it's still stable.
[10:05.840 --> 10:06.840]  It still looks good.
[10:06.840 --> 10:07.840]  I approve you guys.
[10:07.840 --> 10:10.120]  I will give a positive thumbs up shout out.
[10:10.120 --> 10:14.840]  This is Rost and Jeff approved MOT extractions, cheese, Nugget Run.
[10:14.840 --> 10:15.840]  So check those guys out.
[10:16.080 --> 10:17.400]  I'm going to post them on Instagram or something.
[10:17.400 --> 10:19.600]  I will after the show, I'll follow you guys after the show.
[10:19.600 --> 10:22.840]  Now that I approve of your product, they were super kind to me.
[10:22.840 --> 10:24.120]  Big shout out for all the morning dabs.
[10:24.120 --> 10:25.760]  So let me find my notes I took here.
[10:25.760 --> 10:30.800]  I honestly have notes cause I'm trying to cover all this stuff and here we go.
[10:30.800 --> 10:32.000]  So we got there.
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.600]  Oh, so yeah, here we go.
[10:33.600 --> 10:35.120]  Eventually I bumped into my friend Jay.
[10:35.120 --> 10:36.120]  What's up Jay?
[10:36.120 --> 10:37.120]  I hope you're listening to this episode.
[10:37.120 --> 10:39.400]  A shout out to at dreadful Jan Instagram.
[10:39.400 --> 10:40.400]  That's my buddy there.
[10:40.400 --> 10:41.400]  One of my best friends.
[10:41.400 --> 10:42.400]  Everybody thought that was my girlfriend.
[10:42.400 --> 10:44.520]  Uh, no offense to Jay.
[10:44.520 --> 10:45.520]  She's not my girlfriend.
[10:46.200 --> 10:47.200]  She's just like one of my best friends.
[10:47.200 --> 10:51.880]  Uh, and she lives in Cali and I live in Colorado, so she can really, you know, that'd be awkward
[10:51.880 --> 10:53.320]  to have a girlfriend so far away.
[10:53.320 --> 10:55.640]  And honestly, if she stays, my friend will be best friends forever.
[10:55.640 --> 10:56.640]  So we can't fuck that up.
[10:56.640 --> 10:58.480]  Anyway, shout out to Jay.
[10:58.480 --> 11:00.360]  Eventually I bumped into her, bumped into her shit.
[11:00.360 --> 11:02.840]  She ran from across the cup and tackled, hugged me.
[11:02.840 --> 11:05.720]  She jumped up and latched up onto me and gave me the biggest, sweetest hug.
[11:05.720 --> 11:08.480]  I haven't seen her in a year, so it was great to get that hug.
[11:08.480 --> 11:09.480]  What's up mama?
[11:09.480 --> 11:10.480]  I miss you already.
[11:10.480 --> 11:11.660]  It's only been gone for a few days.
[11:11.660 --> 11:15.240]  So a Jan, I raged the cup for most of the first day together.
[11:15.240 --> 11:16.440]  I walked around selling seeds.
[11:16.440 --> 11:21.560]  I took a box of seeds and, uh, I wore an I read genetics t-shirt and put my dreadlocks
[11:21.560 --> 11:25.160]  down and just walked with my box of seeds and I sold plenty of packs of seeds that way.
[11:25.160 --> 11:26.160]  It was kind of nice.
[11:26.160 --> 11:28.960]  I did spend some time at the, uh, sour seeds booth.
[11:28.960 --> 11:32.240]  Shout out to Rob at the sour seed co shout out to rusty at can of venture.
[11:32.240 --> 11:37.400]  Uh, the first day I spent some time at that booth, it was great, but, uh, honestly I had
[11:37.400 --> 11:40.940]  more, uh, seed sales by walking around and I got to see more people.
[11:40.940 --> 11:42.680]  So I abandoned the booth idea and just went and mingled.
[11:42.680 --> 11:43.680]  It was a great time.
[11:44.480 --> 11:46.760]  Uh, so I also got a lot of compliments on the podcast.
[11:46.760 --> 11:47.760]  That was really cool.
[11:47.760 --> 11:51.160]  I expected more reaction to the seeds and whatnot.
[11:51.160 --> 11:54.000]  I thought people would be more interested in my beans, but a lot of people knew who
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.840]  I was because of the podcast.
[11:55.840 --> 12:01.720]  So it's going to need that this podcast has reached the same amount of notoriety as the
[12:01.720 --> 12:02.720]  seed company.
[12:02.720 --> 12:03.720]  Where am I?
[12:03.720 --> 12:05.200]  I'm not even using the notes anymore.
[12:05.200 --> 12:06.760]  I'm just fucking rambling to tell you the truth.
[12:06.760 --> 12:10.040]  Trying to talk about my show or talk about my experience on the show.
[12:10.040 --> 12:11.640]  Yeah, I am reading notes and talking now.
[12:11.640 --> 12:12.640]  I got to stop doing that.
[12:12.640 --> 12:13.640]  So I headed back to the hotel.
[12:14.600 --> 12:15.600]  Where am I?
[12:15.600 --> 12:16.600]  Got a lot of compliments on the podcast.
[12:16.600 --> 12:18.040]  So after the cannabis cup, it got cold.
[12:18.040 --> 12:19.040]  Yes, that's where I was.
[12:19.040 --> 12:20.080]  It got fucking cold.
[12:20.080 --> 12:22.880]  You guys all weekend, the weather kept changing.
[12:22.880 --> 12:23.880]  So it got cold.
[12:23.880 --> 12:24.880]  This is Saturday night.
[12:24.880 --> 12:27.080]  So I headed back to the hotel room to warm up, get some food.
[12:27.080 --> 12:29.920]  I ate some of that pizza that I had left over from the night before.
[12:29.920 --> 12:30.920]  That was pretty dankalicious.
[12:30.920 --> 12:34.920]  I actually took a couple of fatty dabs and fell asleep for a couple hours cause, uh,
[12:34.920 --> 12:35.920]  you got a sunburn.
[12:35.920 --> 12:36.920]  I was up early.
[12:36.920 --> 12:39.960]  Uh, but after that I woke up and I headed to a private party.
[12:40.280 --> 12:43.720]  Uh, there was a private party outside the Oriental theater.
[12:43.720 --> 12:48.640]  And um, so we weren't able to smoke in the theater.
[12:48.640 --> 12:50.280]  I never even made it inside the theater.
[12:50.280 --> 12:53.760]  Honestly, it was loud as shit and crowded, but we weren't able to smoke in there because
[12:53.760 --> 12:58.720]  the fire department, the police and the MED were all doing random inspections on clubs
[12:58.720 --> 13:00.400]  that weekend to see who was smoking.
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.520]  Cause they knew people are going to be smoking in clubs and it's illegal to smoke in places.
[13:04.520 --> 13:06.160]  So we weren't allowed to smoke in there.
[13:06.160 --> 13:11.800]  So, uh, we found a way around it and I guess since the party's over, excuse me, I'm burping.
[13:11.800 --> 13:14.320]  I guess since the party's over, I could, uh, blow up the spa.
[13:14.320 --> 13:15.320]  This is how we did it.
[13:15.320 --> 13:16.480]  Outside the theater.
[13:16.480 --> 13:18.280]  These people park two tour buses.
[13:18.280 --> 13:23.240]  Uh, one of the tour buses had a private party and since the bus is private, nobody can come
[13:23.240 --> 13:25.000]  in and tell us that we can't smoke there.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  The cops aren't even welcome on the bus without a warrant or unless a crime happens in there.
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.560]  The fire department has no damn reason.
[13:30.560 --> 13:34.000]  And the MED is definitely not coming on a private tour bus.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.560]  So, uh, some, uh, some of our friends, I don't want to say their names, but big shout
[13:37.560 --> 13:38.760]  out for you guys listening to the show.
[13:38.760 --> 13:41.000]  That was fucking smooth of you to pull it off that way.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.120]  They set up tour buses and we just went up on the tour buses.
[13:43.120 --> 13:44.120]  You had to be kind of invited.
[13:44.120 --> 13:45.120]  You had to know what was up.
[13:45.120 --> 13:48.080]  I got a Facebook and a text message saying, Hey, Roe, this is where we are.
[13:48.080 --> 13:49.080]  We're on these buses.
[13:49.080 --> 13:51.600]  So I went up on the bus, dabbed out in one.
[13:51.600 --> 13:55.640]  Um, there's a bond going, there's these one party, one tour bus was set up like a party
[13:55.640 --> 13:56.640]  bus.
[13:56.640 --> 13:57.640]  There was a bond going around.
[13:57.640 --> 13:58.640]  People were serving drinks.
[13:58.640 --> 13:59.640]  There was a full on DJ.
[13:59.640 --> 14:00.640]  That was pretty dank.
[14:00.640 --> 14:01.640]  bus.
[14:01.640 --> 14:08.000]  Uh, the other bus was being used for a private breeders only seed swap type of event.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.040]  I got to go in there and meet a bunch of breeders.
[14:10.040 --> 14:12.120]  A lot of like dark horse genetics was in there.
[14:12.120 --> 14:17.280]  The guy that just bred the, uh, cherry Afghan, man, I wish I could remember your name because
[14:17.280 --> 14:18.680]  that shit smelled delicious, bro.
[14:18.680 --> 14:19.680]  That guy was in there.
[14:19.680 --> 14:21.640]  A lot of people were in there.
[14:21.640 --> 14:25.840]  So people were just swapping seeds and, uh, there's a little seed sales going on in there.
[14:25.840 --> 14:27.880]  Uh, that was great, but it got kind of late.
[14:27.880 --> 14:30.680]  I got to give some of my seeds to some really respectful people.
[14:30.680 --> 14:35.320]  Mr. Spliff of cannabis has some, or Mr. Spliff of now he's of gauge green, but Mr. Spliff
[14:35.320 --> 14:36.680]  has some of my us beans.
[14:36.680 --> 14:38.000]  Now he'll be growing that stuff.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.280]  Uh, it got late.
[14:39.280 --> 14:43.360]  So I went back to my hotel to gear up for gate day two, because this was only the first
[14:43.360 --> 14:44.360]  day of the cup.
[14:44.360 --> 14:46.320]  You guys, I got to meet up with a lot of people.
[14:46.320 --> 14:47.560]  I got to hang out with task rock.
[14:47.560 --> 14:51.860]  I don't even want to list all the people that I saw because I will forget more people than
[14:51.860 --> 14:52.860]  I remembered.
[14:52.860 --> 14:55.400]  It was a huge weekend and I got a sunburn.
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.120]  I got dabbed out and I recently had a head injury and I feel like I don't remember as
[14:59.120 --> 15:01.120]  much shit as I should.
[15:01.120 --> 15:05.520]  But for Sunday I slept in a little, uh, because I wore myself out Saturday.
[15:05.520 --> 15:06.680]  I definitely was exhausted.
[15:06.680 --> 15:09.680]  I slept in a little, I headed to the cup around lunchtime.
[15:09.680 --> 15:11.240]  Um, I got smart.
[15:11.240 --> 15:13.400]  I went to the grocery store and got a bunch of fruit.
[15:13.400 --> 15:16.980]  And since I had the vendor wristband, I was able to take some fruit and some healthy drinks
[15:16.980 --> 15:18.760]  into my backpack with me and sneak those in.
[15:18.760 --> 15:20.760]  Cause I didn't have a security thing to go through.
[15:20.760 --> 15:22.880]  All the normal people had to go through security.
[15:22.880 --> 15:24.160]  I got the little VIP vendor pass.
[15:24.160 --> 15:25.760]  So I just got to walk right past all that shit.
[15:25.760 --> 15:27.240]  That was awesome.
[15:27.240 --> 15:31.760]  So, uh, dude, that dab is working by the way that, uh, cheese nugget is definitely kicking
[15:31.760 --> 15:32.760]  in.
[15:32.760 --> 15:36.320]  So, uh, yeah, I slept in a little, took some fruit with me.
[15:36.320 --> 15:37.320]  So I had some food.
[15:37.320 --> 15:38.640]  It took me about an hour to park that day.
[15:38.640 --> 15:42.840]  Uh, from the time I got, you know what, before I got to the 58th street exit, traffic was
[15:42.840 --> 15:47.800]  already backed up on the exit and it took me 15 minutes to get from the exit to the
[15:47.800 --> 15:49.280]  parking areas.
[15:49.280 --> 15:52.840]  And then I had to drive around for another 20 or 30 to find a parking spot.
[15:52.840 --> 15:56.200]  Uh, and the parking cost me 20 or 30 bucks each day.
[15:56.200 --> 16:02.080]  So I got into the cup, I wandered around and then eventually I bumped into Jay again.
[16:02.080 --> 16:06.140]  Uh, her and I walked around the cup and bumped into a bunch of friends until we decided we
[16:06.140 --> 16:09.000]  needed some serious dabs at the cannabis cup.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.840]  You'd think there's a lot of places to hang out and take some dabs, but there was really
[16:11.840 --> 16:15.400]  not a lot of comfy places to just chill out and smoke.
[16:15.400 --> 16:18.660]  Uh, there are some VIP areas and shit, but they fill up quickly.
[16:19.040 --> 16:24.400]  So, uh, my friend Jay and I, Julie, uh, we found a loading dock area and we made a little
[16:24.400 --> 16:28.300]  dab area for ourselves and got comfy there and just dabbed out and took a bunch of selfies
[16:28.300 --> 16:30.480]  and had a good time for a few.
[16:30.480 --> 16:31.480]  So Sunday was a really fun day.
[16:31.480 --> 16:32.480]  It was more relaxed than Saturday.
[16:32.480 --> 16:33.480]  Saturday was kind of crowded.
[16:33.480 --> 16:36.660]  It's kind of hustle and bustle because everyone's trying to meet up with all their friends.
[16:36.660 --> 16:37.660]  It's like the first day of school.
[16:37.660 --> 16:40.840]  I haven't seen a lot of those people in close to a year, if not a year.
[16:40.840 --> 16:44.500]  So I was mostly bumping into friends and hanging out with Jay until the evening when we headed
[16:44.500 --> 16:46.220]  to the award ceremony.
[16:46.380 --> 16:48.580]  Um, let's see.
[16:48.580 --> 16:50.940]  Yeah, the award ceremony was Saturday night, sir.
[16:50.940 --> 16:51.940]  There is a three day event.
[16:51.940 --> 16:52.940]  So I'm confused by that.
[16:52.940 --> 16:54.140]  I get fucked up on that all the time.
[16:54.140 --> 16:56.940]  Usually you do the awards at the last day, but they didn't, which we'll talk about something
[16:56.940 --> 16:58.140]  on that also.
[16:58.140 --> 17:02.280]  So until the award ceremony, uh, the highlight of my day was probably hanging out and eating
[17:02.280 --> 17:04.700]  lunch with, uh, Addison DeMora.
[17:04.700 --> 17:08.900]  Um, the lines were really long at all the food trucks, but there's one food truck that
[17:08.900 --> 17:12.820]  serves, uh, organic gluten-free food.
[17:12.820 --> 17:16.980]  And it's funny cause there's chicken legs, hot dogs, burgers, French fries, all kinds
[17:16.980 --> 17:17.980]  of food trucks.
[17:17.980 --> 17:18.980]  Right.
[17:18.980 --> 17:21.860]  And then in the middle, there's this one little blue baby blue food truck that sells salads
[17:21.860 --> 17:22.860]  for nine bucks.
[17:22.860 --> 17:28.540]  Uh, I got a salad with some chopped up strawberries and some blueberries and some fruit that I
[17:28.540 --> 17:29.540]  couldn't identify.
[17:29.540 --> 17:30.540]  It was delicious.
[17:30.540 --> 17:31.540]  It was good.
[17:31.540 --> 17:32.540]  I just don't know what the hell it was.
[17:32.540 --> 17:34.780]  And then in the bottom, there were chunks of Feta.
[17:34.780 --> 17:37.760]  And then every time I started, I found another layer of goodness in there, but there was
[17:37.760 --> 17:39.980]  honey all over it for dressing.
[17:39.980 --> 17:44.020]  I was nine bucks, but that was like the most, uh, most edible stuff.
[17:44.020 --> 17:45.420]  I'm a vegetarian and I try to eat well.
[17:45.420 --> 17:47.220]  So that was the most edible stuff there.
[17:47.220 --> 17:48.860]  So that line was two people long.
[17:48.860 --> 17:52.940]  There's two people in front of me and I had my food in less than like five minutes.
[17:52.940 --> 17:57.700]  Jay wanted some food from another cart and she waited in line for the entire time that
[17:57.700 --> 17:58.900]  I was in line.
[17:58.900 --> 18:02.260]  Plus the time that I ate my food plus a little bit longer.
[18:02.260 --> 18:06.500]  Uh, some people walked by and saw me at a table and I was sitting at a table where four
[18:06.500 --> 18:09.100]  people could fit and they saw me there by myself and they're like, Hey dude, can we
[18:09.220 --> 18:10.220]  eat with you?
[18:10.220 --> 18:11.220]  And I was like, well, shit.
[18:11.220 --> 18:12.220]  Yeah.
[18:12.220 --> 18:13.220]  You got plenty of time.
[18:13.220 --> 18:15.740]  And those people ate their meals, uh, cleaned up after themselves, shook my hand, said goodbye
[18:15.740 --> 18:18.140]  and took off before Jay even got her food.
[18:18.140 --> 18:19.940]  That's how long some of the food lines were.
[18:19.940 --> 18:24.820]  Uh, so since I'm sitting by the organic food truck, eating my food, uh, my buddy Addison
[18:24.820 --> 18:28.860]  DeMora walked up and sat down and, uh, or ordered food at the food truck.
[18:28.860 --> 18:32.540]  And then after that he came and sat down with me and I think having lunch with Addy might
[18:32.540 --> 18:37.140]  have been my highlight of my afternoon up until the awards ceremony.
[18:37.140 --> 18:39.980]  Addison is a busy man and it seems like everybody at the cannabis cup knew him.
[18:39.980 --> 18:44.740]  So getting an hour out of his life for him to just sit down and hang out, not talk business,
[18:44.740 --> 18:48.380]  to just be my bro for an hour and hang out and catch up was really an honor.
[18:48.380 --> 18:49.380]  So shout out to Addison.
[18:49.380 --> 18:50.660]  I hope you get to hear this, bro.
[18:50.660 --> 18:53.780]  So after a bunch of dabs with Addison and dabbed so hard and Julie joined us at the
[18:53.780 --> 18:56.140]  table, uh, we made another friend at the table too.
[18:56.140 --> 18:57.140]  I cannot remember her name.
[18:57.140 --> 18:58.140]  Her name might've been Elise.
[18:58.140 --> 18:59.140]  Yeah, it was.
[18:59.140 --> 19:00.140]  Uh, her name was Elise.
[19:00.140 --> 19:04.500]  She was a medical cannabis user and she uses cannabis for several reasons and she was just
[19:04.500 --> 19:06.660]  waiting for her friend in line also.
[19:07.180 --> 19:09.820]  And so she sat down and ate with me and since she ate with me when she was done, I gave
[19:09.820 --> 19:13.020]  her some dabs just like the rest of the crew and she really appreciated it.
[19:13.020 --> 19:15.140]  Uh, I misjudged that lady.
[19:15.140 --> 19:19.620]  Uh, she was, uh, I don't even want to guess how old she was.
[19:19.620 --> 19:24.020]  She was older than me and she seemed all nice and kind, but she took a dab like a fucking
[19:24.020 --> 19:25.020]  champ.
[19:25.020 --> 19:27.100]  You know, should've given her larger tabs.
[19:27.100 --> 19:28.100]  It's pretty funny.
[19:28.100 --> 19:32.300]  So after the, uh, a bunch of dabs and she was time for the award ceremony, um, the award
[19:32.300 --> 19:33.660]  ceremony was really neat.
[19:33.660 --> 19:34.700]  It's kind of chaos.
[19:34.700 --> 19:35.820]  Like high times always is.
[19:35.820 --> 19:37.700]  They made the first award, they made a mistake.
[19:37.700 --> 19:40.500]  They announced the third place is the first place in the first place is the third place
[19:40.500 --> 19:45.100]  and it was always already chaos, but that's how high times likes to do shit.
[19:45.100 --> 19:47.420]  So they finally got their shit together.
[19:47.420 --> 19:49.700]  Vader won the first three awards.
[19:49.700 --> 19:53.620]  Uh, we'll talk about that in a minute, but one thing that really stood out to me was
[19:53.620 --> 19:58.300]  when high times brought out two members of the Jamaican ganja farmers association.
[19:58.300 --> 20:02.860]  Uh, one guy was, uh, he had short hair and wore a jacket.
[20:02.860 --> 20:07.820]  And then the other guy was taller and had dreadlocks to his ass.
[20:07.820 --> 20:12.140]  And he was the, um, representative of the Rasta community.
[20:12.140 --> 20:17.080]  And these guys spoke about legalization in Jamaica and they announced that the, uh, high
[20:17.080 --> 20:22.060]  times would be hosting a cannabis cup on the Island of Jamaica in November.
[20:22.060 --> 20:26.380]  So I'm thinking about going, but honestly, I don't know if I want to travel to Jamaica
[20:26.380 --> 20:27.700]  for a cannabis cup.
[20:27.700 --> 20:32.940]  It might not be the most, uh, financially sound idea, but you know, you gotta do what
[20:32.940 --> 20:33.940]  you gotta do.
[20:33.940 --> 20:34.940]  Sometimes I'll think about it.
[20:34.940 --> 20:35.940]  You got a lot of things I'm thinking about.
[20:35.940 --> 20:39.860]  Uh, one thing I thought was funny when the Jamaican came out, the Jamaican guy, the Rasta
[20:39.860 --> 20:41.180]  started speaking.
[20:41.180 --> 20:47.140]  Uh, he said greetings in the name of the most high, his Imperial majesty, King Haile Selassie
[20:47.140 --> 20:52.260]  had the first jaw and all of the Rastas in the room yelled Rasta far.
[20:52.260 --> 20:56.620]  And a guy behind me bumped his buddy on the shoulder and said, what did he just say?
[20:56.620 --> 21:00.500]  And I jokingly turned back and politely said, he said, hello.
[21:00.500 --> 21:03.980]  I thought it was pretty funny because the dude behind me had no idea what this old Rasta
[21:03.980 --> 21:05.580]  man just said.
[21:05.580 --> 21:10.220]  So I was really excited to see a Rasta man come out at the cannabis cup and tell me that
[21:10.220 --> 21:12.580]  there's going to be a cannabis cup in Jamaica in November.
[21:12.580 --> 21:15.540]  That was kind of neat just to see some true Rastas come out and get to celebrate Rasta
[21:15.540 --> 21:18.340]  far at the cannabis cup was nice also.
[21:18.340 --> 21:20.700]  So let's talk about the awards.
[21:20.700 --> 21:21.700]  Here we go.
[21:21.700 --> 21:25.460]  I'm proud as fuck to announce that Spencer and Maddie from the garden of Wheaton won
[21:25.460 --> 21:30.220]  first place for best CBD concentrate at the cannabis cup.
[21:30.220 --> 21:31.220]  That's it.
[21:31.220 --> 21:35.500]  That's that means that means we've had a cannabis cup winner on this podcast now.
[21:35.500 --> 21:36.500]  Yeah.
[21:36.500 --> 21:42.860]  The first female to come to record at my house and be on the podcast is also a cannabis cup
[21:42.860 --> 21:45.260]  winner in the CBD extract category.
[21:45.260 --> 21:48.020]  I'm proud as shit for my crew to tell you the truth.
[21:48.020 --> 21:49.820]  Um, I had that head wound, right?
[21:49.820 --> 21:54.100]  And I didn't feel good for a few days and I went to Spencer's to go kick back just to
[21:54.100 --> 21:55.100]  get away.
[21:55.740 --> 21:58.020]  And he just made the cup entry and he's like, try this dog.
[21:58.020 --> 21:59.580]  It's my CBD entry.
[21:59.580 --> 22:03.340]  And I hit it and it tasted like I'd just bit into oranges.
[22:03.340 --> 22:07.100]  It tastes like I had a mouthful of delicious sweet oranges, but I'm drooling now and I
[22:07.100 --> 22:09.020]  kind of want an orange because of this.
[22:09.020 --> 22:14.820]  But uh, and I blew it out and I, uh, I'd had a concussion and it felt like I had a belt
[22:14.820 --> 22:15.820]  tight around my head.
[22:15.820 --> 22:17.100]  It felt like just pressure around my head.
[22:17.100 --> 22:20.980]  When I blew out this dab, it felt like you undid the belt a couple of notches.
[22:20.980 --> 22:24.940]  And then he gave me a couple of more dabs and I looked at him and I was like, bro, I
[22:25.780 --> 22:28.380]  am the most comfortable right now that I've been in several days.
[22:28.380 --> 22:31.900]  Cause I was in pain and my head hurt and I wasn't feeling right.
[22:31.900 --> 22:34.740]  And those dabs like set me right, dude.
[22:34.740 --> 22:39.020]  And he told me, he said, you look like you're the best you've been in a few days.
[22:39.020 --> 22:41.940]  Like I guess people could physically see that I didn't feel good.
[22:41.940 --> 22:46.700]  I didn't realize I was showing it, but those dabs were amazing.
[22:46.700 --> 22:48.060]  They definitely helped me out.
[22:48.060 --> 22:53.220]  So big shout out to Spence, big shout out to Maddie, much love to the entire squad at
[22:53.220 --> 22:56.140]  the garden of Wheaton, big Mike Fong, sloppy, everybody.
[22:56.140 --> 22:58.660]  So rocking Nana, everybody over there.
[22:58.660 --> 22:59.660]  I love all you guys do.
[22:59.660 --> 23:00.860]  And I'm super fucking proud of you guys.
[23:00.860 --> 23:05.540]  Haven't not had a chance to visit them since the cannabis cup victory, but, uh, I'm sure
[23:05.540 --> 23:06.540]  I'll get them on the show.
[23:06.540 --> 23:09.780]  Spence, if you're listening, bro, you know, you got to come be on the podcast.
[23:09.780 --> 23:11.420]  I haven't even bothered him about it yet.
[23:11.420 --> 23:14.060]  You guys, because it's only been a few days after the cup.
[23:14.060 --> 23:17.220]  Everyone's just getting home, getting back to our normal routines, getting our dogs loved
[23:17.220 --> 23:20.380]  on getting our plants caught up, catching up with all of our friends here, back where
[23:20.380 --> 23:21.380]  we live and shit.
[23:21.820 --> 23:23.220]  I'll get them on the show.
[23:23.220 --> 23:24.260]  I will get them on the show.
[23:24.260 --> 23:26.100]  The second place in the same category.
[23:26.100 --> 23:27.100]  I'm kind of proud of this.
[23:27.100 --> 23:30.900]  We went to our friends, uh, Joey and Shelley at natural mistake, cannabis caregivers in
[23:30.900 --> 23:33.260]  Colorado Springs with their CBD entry.
[23:33.260 --> 23:37.660]  I have it on a screen far away here.
[23:37.660 --> 23:39.700]  I'm going to tell you what they entered.
[23:39.700 --> 23:42.260]  I'm going to press pause for a second and I'm going to pull up the winners here.
[23:42.260 --> 23:44.060]  My computer is kind of far out of reach.
[23:44.060 --> 23:45.060]  All right.
[23:45.060 --> 23:46.060]  I got the article here.
[23:46.060 --> 23:47.060]  Sorry.
[23:47.060 --> 23:48.060]  I had to reach for it.
[23:48.460 --> 23:53.780]  In the best CBD concentrate went to natural mystic cannabis caregivers with their can
[23:53.780 --> 23:55.980]  a tonic, which actually is a great strain.
[23:55.980 --> 24:00.820]  If you listen to the episode I did with Angela about CBD medicine, Canada tonic might've
[24:00.820 --> 24:01.820]  been the culprit there.
[24:01.820 --> 24:03.860]  That was the high CBD medicine.
[24:03.860 --> 24:06.260]  So big shout out to natural mystic cannabis caregivers.
[24:06.260 --> 24:09.780]  I'll tell you the third place since we're on the whole category, it was industrial hemp
[24:09.780 --> 24:13.780]  CBD extract with, Oh, that looks crazy, dude.
[24:13.780 --> 24:20.420]  It's ISO, ISO deal, ISO deal S a, and it looks like, um, it doesn't look like any cannabis
[24:20.420 --> 24:21.420]  product ever.
[24:21.420 --> 24:24.820]  It looks like white powdery substances that I don't even, uh, want to tell you what it
[24:24.820 --> 24:25.820]  looks like.
[24:25.820 --> 24:26.820]  It looks like drugs, dude.
[24:26.820 --> 24:28.260]  If you showed up with that, they put that on my table.
[24:28.260 --> 24:29.820]  I'd tell you to fucking leave.
[24:29.820 --> 24:30.820]  That's funny.
[24:30.820 --> 24:31.820]  Uh, all right.
[24:31.820 --> 24:35.140]  So big shout out to Joey and Shelley at the natural mystic cannabis caregivers.
[24:35.140 --> 24:39.420]  Also I need to give a huge, big shout out to my friend Noah at champion cannabis.
[24:39.420 --> 24:40.460]  Let's see what they actually call themselves.
[24:40.460 --> 24:44.660]  I know they go by champion cannabis, but their dispensary one is a different name.
[24:44.660 --> 24:45.820]  I'm scrolling up through that.
[24:45.820 --> 24:46.820]  This article is long.
[24:46.820 --> 24:50.260]  Um, let's see, do you just want me to read all of them?

[34:51.180 --> 34:56.260]  in Denver go there you guys it's a super tasty place the vibes pretty cool I'll definitely
[34:56.260 --> 35:00.380]  go back there for sure I had a pizza from there and I also had the angel hair pasta
[35:00.380 --> 35:05.180]  meal from there it was super dank my friend Dean is a meat-eating heathen I'm just picking
[35:05.180 --> 35:09.700]  on him I love you guys eat meat don't worry I don't judge he had a burger and dude it

[35:13.580 --> 35:20.700]  was able to eat that looked good so I mentioned Vader right let's talk about something that
[35:20.700 --> 35:26.420]  I found kind of disrespectful at the Cannabis Cup a company called Vader won several awards
[35:26.420 --> 35:30.820]  they won the first three awards that were given away at the cup they had a huge setup
[35:30.820 --> 35:35.140]  at the they had a place called Vader village in the Cannabis Cup it was a huge setup with
[35:35.140 --> 35:39.500]  a stage they had live musical acts they had semi-famous celebrities at the booths all
[35:39.500 --> 35:44.220]  day my friend Adam Hill was there launching prizes into the crowd he had the t-shirt gun
[35:44.220 --> 35:50.820]  the t-shirt can and he would fill it up with packages of shatter and launch and joints
[35:50.820 --> 35:55.980]  and bags of weed and launch bags of weed and shatter and joints into the crowd of people
[35:55.980 --> 35:59.480]  and people would go nuts and get it so they win best booth they won all kinds of prizes
[35:59.480 --> 36:03.760]  right this is Saturday night the cup happened Sunday or Monday this was Sunday night when
[36:03.760 --> 36:09.180]  they went everything Monday is 420 everyone's stoked right we show up for the cup Vader
[36:09.180 --> 36:15.060]  village is gone they have taken down their entire booth tore down everything the day
[36:15.060 --> 36:18.820]  after they so they win and they just take all their shit down they won several awards
[36:18.820 --> 36:23.500]  and they packed up at night while everyone was asleep and they took off Monday before
[36:23.500 --> 36:27.940]  the cup opened at noon and that just seems disrespectful to me like if you're gonna come
[36:27.940 --> 36:31.880]  to a competition if you're gonna come to an event and you're gonna build a big-ass stage
[36:31.880 --> 36:35.900]  and make a big spectacle then you win hang out for the last day and play with all the
[36:35.900 --> 36:39.900]  cool kids don't be a dick and leave I just found that disrespectful it's not even my
[36:39.900 --> 36:46.740]  event but whatever I found that rude so congrats on all your wins Vader but that was not a
[36:46.740 --> 36:51.940]  classy move to do that so let's move on a little bit this leads me into Monday Monday
[36:51.940 --> 36:56.380]  was day three of the cannabis cup Monday was 420 and the place was super crowded the weather
[36:56.380 --> 37:02.340]  had been sketchy all weekend so at some points I was wearing a t-shirt and I was sweating
[37:02.460 --> 37:07.460]  and then other times I was had a hoodie on with my hood up and I was freezing so the
[37:07.460 --> 37:12.540]  weather was super sketchy Monday had a nice break in the weather so it felt like everybody
[37:12.540 --> 37:15.860]  showed up for the last part of the day like around 3 o'clock it got pretty nice the place
[37:15.860 --> 37:22.860]  was stupid crowded for 420 on 420 at 420 it was crazy but I got there around lunchtime
[37:22.860 --> 37:27.500]  I milled around said goodbye to everyone that I hung out with because I only see a lot of
[37:27.500 --> 37:31.020]  these people once a year you know all these seed companies all my friends from the internet
[37:31.020 --> 37:35.980]  we only meet up like once a year because this is where everybody is so I pretty much
[37:35.980 --> 37:40.220]  said goodbye to everybody I got to hang out with went and visited a few booths picked
[37:40.220 --> 37:44.740]  up a couple of pieces of merchandise surprisingly the only thing I really bought oh man I got
[37:44.740 --> 37:47.660]  to give a huge shout out did I write this down this is all my other notes so I'll skip

[40:32.940 --> 40:36.840]  walked up to me and this happened two days in a row he walked up to me and he handed
[40:36.840 --> 40:42.240]  me these little packages and it says Electrum extracts I'm just gonna pull this whole thing
[40:42.240 --> 40:46.640]  out of here it's kind of hard to read there we go they're a little smelly proof bags and
[40:46.640 --> 40:49.520]  it's got the smelly proof logo right over his logo so I'm gonna take it out so I could
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.960]  see it it says Electrum extracts and you unfold it on the other side it says lemon skunk times
[40:53.960 --> 40:58.920]  banana kush contains a hundred percent organic cannabis whole plant extracted via n-butane
[40:58.920 --> 41:03.800]  n-propane mix in a closed-loop extraction system and his Instagram check this out as
[41:03.800 --> 41:10.460]  Electrum extracts e-l-e-c-t-r-u-m extracts on Instagram then it says not for use by children
[41:10.580 --> 41:15.620]  so what he gave me here he handed me some butane hash oil my favorite thing some BHO
[41:15.620 --> 41:18.900]  some dabs bro and what he said was I want you to try this on the show and let me know
[41:18.900 --> 41:27.300]  what you think so here we go I'm going to try the lemon skunk banana kush I'm reaching
[41:27.300 --> 41:32.300]  for all my tools right now cleaning off the carb cap unwrapping the parchment it's a nice
[41:32.300 --> 41:35.700]  friendly portion he gave me too I've already dabbed a few dabs I don't remember what it
[41:35.700 --> 41:43.420]  would have weighed but I'm gonna take a decent sized dab here and then we'll talk about it
[41:43.420 --> 41:49.020]  here we go this is Electrum extracts um it's uh lemon skunk banana kush dab with me if
[41:49.020 --> 42:04.010]  you've got some dabs dab with me come on let's do this here we go three two one dab oh did
[42:04.010 --> 42:08.610]  it taste good on the way in usually you don't taste good smoke until the way out that tastes
[42:08.610 --> 42:15.130]  citrusy and lemony on the way in all right I definitely taste the lemons I don't taste
[42:15.130 --> 42:21.130]  the banana kush part but I taste the lemon skunk for sure and here's something I noticed
[42:21.130 --> 42:25.010]  a lot of these lemon skunk strains I've got a lemon skunk plant that I bred to the golden
[42:25.010 --> 42:30.310]  goat made lemon Jeffrey and when I make dabs out of the lemon skunk or the lemon Jeffrey
[42:30.310 --> 42:33.530]  it makes my eyes bounce up and down a little bit for a second like you're dry when you're
[42:33.530 --> 42:40.010]  driving down a fucked up graded dirt road and your eyes just go uh this lemon skunk
[42:40.010 --> 42:44.170]  banana kush dab just made my eyes do that so that's cool I like that that's a good sativa
[42:44.210 --> 42:49.890]  high from that uh I approve man so big shout out to Electrum extracts I do approve of your
[42:49.890 --> 42:56.450]  product that is good shit um yeah get that take dabs of that if that's available somewhere
[42:56.450 --> 43:01.010]  I want some more of that lemon skunk banana kush that's tasty bro good work thanks for
[43:01.010 --> 43:04.850]  giving me that I appreciate that he just walked up to me and he's like my friend said you
[43:04.850 --> 43:09.210]  had a podcast and I should give this to you please review it so I did that it's awesome
[43:09.210 --> 43:13.250]  shit works out sometimes when you're rasta Jeff um he gave me another one too should
[43:13.250 --> 43:17.530]  we try it on the show I think we should it'd be silly not to right here we go this one
[43:17.530 --> 43:23.570]  is rare dankness sativa blend so this one's just gonna be straight a head ripper I haven't
[43:23.570 --> 43:28.890]  tried this one yet unfolding it looking at it it's kind of sappy it's sticking to the
[43:28.890 --> 43:33.210]  parchment a little more than the other one did oh but it's got a nice amber color to
[43:33.210 --> 43:41.610]  it let's see I'm smelling it off the parchment here it's got a it's got an odd flavor uh
[43:41.610 --> 43:47.650]  kind of a lime more lime than what I'm used to in cannabis oh that's a big dab okay we're
[43:47.650 --> 43:52.690]  definitely gonna get a nice flavor out of this so uh we're gonna take a dab once again
[43:52.690 --> 43:57.810]  guys join me hope you got a dab this is the sativa blend contains 100 organic cannabis
[43:57.810 --> 44:02.370]  and it says whole plant extracted via so a whole plant does that mean that you just chuck
[44:02.370 --> 44:07.890]  the cut the buds off the sticks and do uh like fan leaves and nugs all at once I've
[44:07.890 --> 44:11.050]  done that it's cool it comes out great I like to do that with my CBD medicine so you get
[44:11.050 --> 44:16.250]  that full spectrum just curious what that a whole plant they're hinting at there all
[44:16.250 --> 44:33.950]  right take a dab with me guys here we go yeah that lime flavor catches me but this one's
[44:33.950 --> 44:38.390]  good oh it's sativa too because my head is just going whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa I like
[44:38.390 --> 44:45.790]  that I love that feeling oh yeah okay definitely both of those were smooth both of them had
[44:45.790 --> 44:51.070]  a nice texture both more well done um there's too much of a lime flavor on this rare dankness
[44:51.070 --> 44:55.950]  one for me but it's just a personal thing but overall that's a great hash both of these
[44:55.950 --> 45:00.270]  are great uh the only the only reason I don't give this one a perfect 10 is because the
[45:00.270 --> 45:05.110]  lime thing is not my flavor uh the orange flavored one or the lemony flavored one wins
[45:05.110 --> 45:11.510]  so I do give you a thumbs up on both of these overall uh lectrum extracts you guys win dude
[45:11.510 --> 45:17.790]  shout out I like it all right took care of that thank you guys for giving me hash all
[45:17.990 --> 45:20.990]  you guys gave me hash that's super cool I love when people walk up to me and give me
[45:20.990 --> 45:26.190]  stuff it makes me feel great uh talk about the edibles I ate oh yeah so I went to a comedy
[45:26.190 --> 45:28.990]  show and I was gonna we're gonna talk about that more but I want to give a shout out when
[45:28.990 --> 45:33.710]  I'm thinking about it uh when I saw Doug Benson Monday night uh on my way into the show I
[45:33.710 --> 45:37.630]  ate a clotty bear because my friend Claude the candy man from Sweet Stone Candy shout
[45:37.630 --> 45:44.310]  out make sure you check out Sweet Stone Candy Claude gave me a banana clotty bear that was
[45:44.310 --> 45:49.750]  dipped in chocolate and if you know me you know I freaking love banana and you also know that I
[45:49.750 --> 45:54.870]  love chocolate so a hundred milligram edible dipped there was banana flavor dipped in

[46:12.710 --> 46:18.470]  candy for adult use and only uh it says indica on it it says contains two pieces at 50 milligrams
[46:18.470 --> 46:26.790]  each and you know what these guys didn't do bro they did not put any uh sort of branding on here
[46:26.790 --> 46:29.590]  but you know what they did hit me up on Instagram so we're gonna hit Instagram right quick
[46:30.470 --> 46:34.790]  we're gonna see if I have the message where he asked me if I ate the edible yet

[46:39.750 --> 46:46.710]  gave me this edible and uh it's a Lego man it was actually two Lego man uh 50 milligrams each and I
[46:46.710 --> 46:51.350]  ate both of them uh we were at dinner at the Mellow Mushroom and I tore them open while I was waiting
[46:51.350 --> 46:57.270]  for the pizza to come and ate these suckers um I usually don't eat gummies uh just because of
[46:57.270 --> 47:01.670]  I'm just a picky sucker when it comes to my diet but these were pretty good they were not bad at all
[47:01.670 --> 47:07.430]  uh the watermelon candy flavor was pretty uh pretty damn good and I liked them and I was
