[00:00.320 --> 00:18.970]  Yeah, here we go.
[00:18.970 --> 00:20.650]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:20.650 --> 00:21.650]  I'm your host.
[00:21.650 --> 00:23.410]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:23.410 --> 00:27.490]  This is episode 711 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:27.490 --> 00:30.250]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about munchies.
[00:30.250 --> 00:33.650]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the great
[00:33.650 --> 00:38.030]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.

[01:12.110 --> 01:13.110]  Thank you.

[01:18.070 --> 01:19.770]  the show on Patreon.
[01:19.770 --> 01:23.450]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:23.450 --> 01:29.790]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash Grow From Your Heart.
[01:29.790 --> 01:33.090]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen and you know I do include
[01:33.090 --> 01:38.150]  a link in the show notes and in the video description to make that nice and easy for
[01:38.150 --> 01:39.750]  all of my friends.
[01:39.750 --> 01:42.190]  All right, let's not waste too much time.
[01:42.190 --> 01:45.350]  The last couple of episodes were quite intensive episodes.
[01:45.350 --> 01:49.990]  709 was all about the evolution of dabs and dabbing and concentrates.
[01:49.990 --> 01:53.670]  Then of course we had Pedro and Roz and Ryan on for episode 710.
[01:53.670 --> 01:54.830]  We learned a lot.
[01:54.830 --> 01:56.190]  This episode we're going to relax.
[01:56.190 --> 01:57.670]  We're going to cool down a little bit.
[01:57.670 --> 01:58.970]  We're going to have a good time.
[01:58.970 --> 02:02.690]  We're going to talk about something we all enjoy, something we all indulge in, something
[02:02.690 --> 02:07.010]  that may be a little bit of a personal weakness, maybe a point where we spoil ourselves and
[02:07.010 --> 02:08.010]  treat ourselves.
[02:08.010 --> 02:10.090]  Today we're going to talk about munchies.
[02:10.090 --> 02:12.690]  What's better than having some munchies after you smoke?
[02:12.690 --> 02:16.210]  Honestly, this may be a weird side note and this may derail the whole show here, but I
[02:16.210 --> 02:18.690]  like to get super baked and not eat.
[02:18.690 --> 02:20.330]  I like to fight those munchies.
[02:20.330 --> 02:24.370]  Sometimes I feel like those munchies, you get super baked, you take a few fat dabs and
[02:24.370 --> 02:27.690]  then you just start eating cookies and the next thing you know, not even stoned anymore.
[02:27.690 --> 02:30.490]  You got to eat more cookies or you eat a bunch, you take a bunch of dabs and you go
[02:30.490 --> 02:33.650]  to out to dinner and then halfway through dinner, you're like, oh, I just ruined my
[02:33.650 --> 02:34.650]  whole buzz.
[02:34.650 --> 02:35.650]  Don't get me wrong.
[02:35.650 --> 02:40.210]  I love to go to dinner, go to Thai food, order two entrees, super blazed and eat them both.
[02:40.210 --> 02:41.210]  I digress.
[02:41.210 --> 02:43.690]  I'm just saying sometimes I like to fight off those munchies.
[02:43.690 --> 02:45.250]  I don't always go right for it.
[02:45.250 --> 02:47.610]  I like to fight that hunger, enjoy the buzz.
[02:47.610 --> 02:52.410]  However, when I do let those munchies take over, sometimes they win.
[02:52.410 --> 02:55.130]  If I let those munchies kick in, I will eat everything.
[02:55.130 --> 02:56.650]  So let's talk about munchies.
[02:56.650 --> 02:57.650]  Let's talk about this.
[02:57.650 --> 02:59.730]  What do you like to eat once you are stoned?
[02:59.730 --> 03:03.770]  Once you've had, however you like to smoke, you took a few bong rips, smoked a fat joint,
[03:03.770 --> 03:06.770]  maybe you took too many dabs, maybe you ate some edibles, which is something else we're
[03:06.770 --> 03:08.690]  going to talk about here in the episode.
[03:08.690 --> 03:11.610]  What do you enjoy to eat?
[03:11.610 --> 03:14.050]  I often talk about trying to take care of myself.
[03:14.050 --> 03:16.650]  I try to be, uh, it's 2022.
[03:16.650 --> 03:18.050]  We've learned how to take care of ourselves.
[03:18.050 --> 03:20.050]  We should be treating our bodies like our temples.
[03:20.050 --> 03:21.710]  I'm not super young anymore.
[03:21.710 --> 03:22.710]  I'm in my forties.
[03:22.710 --> 03:23.710]  I'm starting to get older.
[03:23.710 --> 03:25.250]  I do feel it when I eat junk food.
[03:25.650 --> 03:30.050]  When I eat unhealthy crap, my body does say, Hey bro, don't eat as much of that or don't
[03:30.050 --> 03:31.330]  eat that again.
[03:31.330 --> 03:35.050]  My body does have ways of letting us know as you get older, pay attention.
[03:35.050 --> 03:37.730]  Your body will tell you that is terrible for me.
[03:37.730 --> 03:38.730]  Stop fucking doing that.
[03:38.730 --> 03:40.190]  There are a lot of things we put in our bodies.
[03:40.190 --> 03:43.010]  We shouldn't be when I get blazed and I do get the munchies.
[03:43.010 --> 03:45.850]  I try to stick with healthy food.
[03:45.850 --> 03:47.850]  However, sometimes I will allow myself.
[03:47.850 --> 03:48.850]  I'm human.
[03:48.850 --> 03:49.850]  Don't get me wrong.
[03:49.850 --> 03:50.850]  I try to eat healthy most of the time.
[03:50.850 --> 03:53.490]  A vegetarian 100% of the time.
[03:53.490 --> 03:54.890]  Vegan most of the time.
[03:55.050 --> 03:57.090]  I do at least one vegan day every week.
[03:57.090 --> 03:58.090]  You guys don't care about my diet.
[03:58.090 --> 04:00.330]  I try to take care of myself when I get blazed.
[04:00.330 --> 04:05.050]  I will allow myself to slip on the diet, have some crap occasionally, especially in the
[04:05.050 --> 04:06.050]  car.
[04:06.050 --> 04:10.330]  If I'm on a road trip and I have to say if I'm the passenger on a road trip, just, you
[04:10.330 --> 04:14.750]  know, for legal and safety reasons, and I do get blazed and we stop at the gas station
[04:14.750 --> 04:20.330]  or somewhere small like that to get some munchies, I definitely will use that as a good excuse
[04:20.330 --> 04:22.290]  to indulge in some crap food.
[04:22.290 --> 04:25.090]  We'll talk about what I get from the gas stations in a moment here.
[04:25.090 --> 04:30.730]  I do prefer honestly to stick with healthier snack options if that's possible, available,
[04:30.730 --> 04:35.850]  affordable, effective, if I prepared properly, and also if that's what my high mouth wants.
[04:35.850 --> 04:39.210]  Sometimes my stoned mouth wants something sugary and terrible for me.
[04:39.210 --> 04:40.450]  Sometimes I'll treat myself.
[04:40.450 --> 04:43.170]  Also I smoke a lot and I do podcasts.
[04:43.170 --> 04:44.610]  I constantly fucking talk.
[04:44.610 --> 04:45.930]  I never stop talking.
[04:45.930 --> 04:46.930]  I get it.
[04:46.930 --> 04:47.930]  I do know that about myself.
[04:47.930 --> 04:52.250]  I apologize if you're sick of hearing me, but that also brings in a lot of dryness.
[04:52.250 --> 04:54.050]  A lot of dry throat, a lot of dry mouth.
[04:54.050 --> 04:55.050]  So I need snacks.
[04:55.050 --> 04:59.890]  I prefer snacks that are juicy and not dehydrating and drying.
[04:59.890 --> 05:02.210]  Something people hate the word moist, but guess what?
[05:02.210 --> 05:04.370]  I need a nice moist snack.
[05:04.370 --> 05:05.970]  Something with some moisture.
[05:05.970 --> 05:09.770]  Not something that's going to induce more cotton mouth, more dryness, more phlegm.
[05:09.770 --> 05:11.610]  I try to stay away from crackers.
[05:11.610 --> 05:13.770]  Like I definitely don't want a cracker.
[05:13.770 --> 05:15.890]  I definitely don't need dairy products.
[05:15.890 --> 05:17.770]  It's going to make me sound all in the throat.
[05:17.770 --> 05:18.770]  I don't need, sorry for doing that.
[05:18.770 --> 05:19.770]  That was fucking rude.
[05:19.770 --> 05:21.090]  I don't need all that kind of snack.
[05:21.090 --> 05:24.330]  So I try to stick with like healthy stuff.
[05:24.330 --> 05:25.330]  What is healthy stuff?
[05:25.330 --> 05:26.330]  Fruit.
[05:26.330 --> 05:28.530]  A lot of people think that fruit is a, it's kind of a hippie snack.
[05:28.530 --> 05:29.530]  It's great.
[05:29.530 --> 05:30.530]  It's what I was put here for.
[05:30.530 --> 05:31.530]  It's got enough sugar to keep you going.
[05:31.530 --> 05:32.890]  It's give you some energy.
[05:32.890 --> 05:36.530]  It's got all the right components to make that sugar not unhealthy.
[05:36.530 --> 05:40.410]  It's got fiber and vitamins in there, depending on the fruit or vegetables you choose.
[05:40.410 --> 05:43.530]  But fruits and vegetables are great for when you're blazed.
[05:43.530 --> 05:45.730]  What's better than biting into like a juicy orange.
[05:45.730 --> 05:46.970]  Think about how good that is.
[05:46.970 --> 05:48.050]  We have forgotten.
[05:48.050 --> 05:49.930]  We go to the store and we get all that shit on the shelves.
[05:49.930 --> 05:51.050]  It's packaged and processed.
[05:52.010 --> 05:53.010]  We forgot how good a fucking orange is.
[05:53.010 --> 05:56.450]  Bite into an orange, a nectarine, a clementine, something like that.
[05:56.450 --> 05:58.090]  Let that juice run down your chin a little bit.
[05:58.090 --> 05:59.370]  Let it absorb into your tongue.
[05:59.370 --> 06:00.450]  Feel how good that shit is.
[06:00.450 --> 06:02.730]  We forgot how good basic fruit is.
[06:02.730 --> 06:06.050]  So when I get blazed, I like fruit, watermelon, strawberries, stuff like that.
[06:06.050 --> 06:07.050]  That's delicious.
[06:07.050 --> 06:08.650]  If it's available.
[06:08.650 --> 06:10.330]  Like I said, sometimes you don't prepare.
[06:10.330 --> 06:11.770]  Sometimes you're not where that stuff is.
[06:11.770 --> 06:14.410]  Sometimes you hit the gas station and you just eat crap.
[06:14.410 --> 06:17.450]  That is when I allow myself to eat crap.
[06:17.450 --> 06:18.450]  I did.
[06:18.450 --> 06:19.450]  I'm going somewhere with all of this.
[06:19.450 --> 06:22.170]  I did post a question to Instagram, to Twitter.
[06:22.170 --> 06:23.970]  I also posted it to my discord.
[06:23.970 --> 06:28.530]  That link is in the show notes and video description, but I asked a lot of my friends what they like
[06:28.530 --> 06:30.490]  to eat and consume once they get blazed.
[06:30.490 --> 06:31.650]  That's where I'm leading with all this.
[06:31.650 --> 06:34.810]  We're going to read the responses to those surveys.
[06:34.810 --> 06:37.130]  I'm just rambling to set it up real good here.
[06:37.130 --> 06:41.930]  I asked about, do you allow yourself to eat crap or do you prefer to eat healthy snacks
[06:41.930 --> 06:42.930]  once you get blazed?
[06:42.930 --> 06:46.970]  I also asked, do you have road trip snacks that you let yourself eat?
[06:46.970 --> 06:51.250]  Then also I asked about regional snacks because I live in Colorado.
[06:51.250 --> 06:53.610]  Here in the summer we have a chili festival.
[06:53.610 --> 06:54.850]  Chilies are kind of our regional thing.
[06:54.850 --> 06:58.170]  I'm sure there's other regional stuff I'm not thinking about, but chilies are kind of
[06:58.170 --> 06:59.170]  our regional snack.
[06:59.170 --> 07:02.890]  Depending on where you go, people are known and areas are known for their snacks.
[07:02.890 --> 07:03.890]  Here we have cantaloupes.
[07:03.890 --> 07:05.930]  We have a lot of cantaloupes in our area.
[07:05.930 --> 07:09.050]  The Rocky Ford cantaloupes are super delicious.
[07:09.050 --> 07:10.490]  Things like that, regional stuff.
[07:10.490 --> 07:12.130]  Then we talk about seasonal stuff.
[07:12.130 --> 07:14.850]  Are there seasonal snacks that you enjoy?
[07:14.850 --> 07:19.050]  I've got a dear friend, somebody I care about a lot, who loves a peppermint cheesecake.
[07:19.050 --> 07:23.210]  We have passed the holiday season and she is going to go crazy until December because
[07:23.210 --> 07:25.210]  we can't get a peppermint cheesecake.
[07:25.210 --> 07:27.770]  That's a seasonal snack she wishes she could have.
[07:27.770 --> 07:29.050]  How about some fast food?
[07:29.050 --> 07:33.010]  Do you guys indulge in fast food when you get the munchies?
[07:33.010 --> 07:34.970]  I really try not to eat fast food.
[07:34.970 --> 07:37.210]  I've talked about how healthy I try to be.
[07:37.210 --> 07:41.410]  Honestly, if the time is right, if we're on the road, if I'm blazed, if things come down
[07:41.410 --> 07:46.610]  to it, I grew up in Southern California and there's nothing like some Taco Bell.
[07:46.610 --> 07:48.890]  Just a couple of bean burritos from Taco Bell.
[07:48.890 --> 07:49.970]  Don't tell me what's in there.
[07:49.970 --> 07:50.970]  Don't talk about it.
[07:50.970 --> 07:55.210]  Just let me enjoy that shit with a bunch of hot sauce and just let me enjoy it when I'm
[07:55.210 --> 07:56.210]  blazed.
[07:56.210 --> 07:58.810]  That's one of my weaknesses, one of my guilty pleasures, if you will.
[07:58.810 --> 08:01.530]  Hashtag SACA souffle.
[08:01.530 --> 08:04.170]  I guess it is time to share some feedback.
[08:04.170 --> 08:05.530]  I also like some chipotle too.
[08:05.530 --> 08:07.570]  Get me nice and blazed and let me eat some chipotle.
[08:07.570 --> 08:08.570]  That's always fun.
[08:08.570 --> 08:10.490]  But then don't be around in like an hour.
[08:10.570 --> 08:13.810]  I guess now is a good time to start sharing the feedback that I have collected.
[08:13.810 --> 08:15.610]  I've got a lot of screenshots here.
[08:15.610 --> 08:19.010]  I basically asked, what do you like to munch when you get blazed?
[08:19.010 --> 08:22.030]  Let's jump into the screenshots, the feedback part of the show.
[08:22.030 --> 08:24.090]  This one came from our buddy Juanzilla on Twitter.
[08:24.090 --> 08:29.010]  It said, my favorite fast food is Bojangles for a wake and bake, a cookout for late night
[08:29.010 --> 08:30.010]  munchies.
[08:30.010 --> 08:32.810]  My seasonal snacks would have to be the peppermint pretzels.
[08:32.810 --> 08:33.810]  I love that.
[08:33.810 --> 08:35.370]  Another peppermint person.
[08:35.370 --> 08:39.170]  Peppermint's not for me, but I have a dear person that loves the peppermint cheesecake.
[08:39.170 --> 08:40.890]  So I get you seasonal and peppermint.
[08:40.890 --> 08:43.370]  I'm trying to figure out where to put the mic and my phone at the same time.
[08:43.370 --> 08:48.570]  If you're watching the weird posture struggle here, that is what's happening.
[08:48.570 --> 08:49.570]  Here we go.
[08:49.570 --> 08:50.570]  More comments.
[08:50.570 --> 08:51.970]  Let's fix this fucking mic stand and regroup here.
[08:51.970 --> 08:52.970]  All right.
[08:52.970 --> 08:55.690]  The next one says, I love, this person must be Canadian.
[08:55.690 --> 08:56.970]  Big shout out to my buddy B. Bala.
[08:56.970 --> 08:58.970]  It says, I love poutine when I'm stoned.
[08:58.970 --> 08:59.970]  I live in Canada.
[08:59.970 --> 09:02.370]  My favorite fast food when stoned is Dairy Queen.
[09:02.370 --> 09:07.170]  I'm always getting a pineapple mango smoothie for the pasties.
[09:07.170 --> 09:11.570]  I'm not sure what you mean by pasties, but, um, oh, maybe you mean pasty mouth, the cotton
[09:11.570 --> 09:12.570]  mouth.
[09:12.570 --> 09:14.090]  That could be the Canadian version of cotton mouth is the pasties.
[09:14.090 --> 09:15.090]  I got you, brother.
[09:15.090 --> 09:16.970]  You got the pasty face truck mouth, cotton mouth.
[09:16.970 --> 09:17.970]  I get you.
[09:17.970 --> 09:20.330]  I wish I could have eggnog ice cream all year round.
[09:20.330 --> 09:24.050]  I'm all about a pineapple mango smoothie.
[09:24.050 --> 09:25.050]  That sounds fucking great.
[09:25.050 --> 09:28.370]  Uh, when you start fucking with that eggnog bro, I'm out dude.
[09:28.370 --> 09:33.370]  That, that just, um, I'm not against your eggnog, but to me it tastes like snot or similar
[09:33.370 --> 09:34.450]  and I am not in dude.
[09:34.450 --> 09:36.130]  I'm checking out at the eggnog.
[09:36.130 --> 09:37.130]  You enjoy it, buddy.
[09:37.130 --> 09:38.210]  You don't want to get more than that means you get more.
[09:38.210 --> 09:39.210]  Are you spiking the eggnog?
[09:39.210 --> 09:40.210]  That's what I want to know.
[09:40.210 --> 09:42.010]  Are you whipping some booze into that bad bitch?
[09:42.010 --> 09:44.290]  Uh, sprinkling it with whatever you put on top of eggnog.
[09:44.290 --> 09:46.370]  I've seen people sprinkle shit on it.
[09:46.370 --> 09:47.370]  Is it warm?
[09:47.370 --> 09:48.370]  Is it cold?
[09:48.370 --> 09:49.370]  I don't know about your eggnog, buddy.
[09:49.370 --> 09:50.370]  You're Canadian.
[09:50.370 --> 09:51.530]  You could be doing some crazy weird shit.
[09:51.530 --> 09:53.990]  Uh, big up to a norm.
[09:53.990 --> 09:58.370]  If you're eating poutine and you don't know who norm is, you're missing out on live hashtag
[09:58.370 --> 09:59.370]  YMH.
[09:59.370 --> 10:00.370]  We've got more feedback.
[10:00.370 --> 10:02.810]  This one came from discord.
[10:02.810 --> 10:05.890]  This one is from our friend reaper 6628.
[10:05.890 --> 10:09.170]  It says, I love to sit down and munch down on chips and salsa.
[10:09.170 --> 10:12.530]  Then I'll finish it off with some sweet ice cream and pie.
[10:12.530 --> 10:15.010]  But sometimes I love to munch down on fruit.
[10:15.010 --> 10:16.010]  I'm seeing a thing here.
[10:16.010 --> 10:19.770]  A lot of people, all the potheads, all the stoners need some sort of food with some sort
[10:19.770 --> 10:21.410]  of refreshing moisture in it.
[10:21.410 --> 10:23.650]  That ice cream, that fruit, I'm getting that.
[10:23.650 --> 10:25.610]  I catch that a lot.
[10:25.610 --> 10:26.930]  What else is another thing that I noticed?
[10:26.930 --> 10:29.770]  Oh, well, something I caught in this pie.
[10:29.770 --> 10:33.050]  I was in a group conversation the other day and I've always said that pie is for old people
[10:33.050 --> 10:35.410]  and a couple of people just said randomly.
[10:35.930 --> 10:36.930]  Pie is for old people.
[10:36.930 --> 10:37.930]  So some people supported my statement.
[10:37.930 --> 10:39.690]  Pie is for old people, bro.
[10:39.690 --> 10:40.690]  That's just a joke.
[10:40.690 --> 10:41.690]  Don't get offended.
[10:41.690 --> 10:42.690]  We're going to keep moving.
[10:42.690 --> 10:45.010]  Um, it says, uh, from Mary J.
[10:45.010 --> 10:48.650]  Juana says my favorite munchie to eat when I'm high is probably apples and peanut butter.
[10:48.650 --> 10:50.250]  That sounds fucking great, dude.
[10:50.250 --> 10:53.850]  Uh, apples, that crispiness, that juiciness and then peanut butter just to give you some
[10:53.850 --> 10:55.810]  protein and some texture in there.
[10:55.810 --> 10:58.370]  Don't have me do a podcast after that, but that sounds great.
[10:58.370 --> 11:00.450]  Uh, favorite fast food is Dunkin Donuts.
[11:00.450 --> 11:03.250]  I absolutely love their bagels smothered in cream cheese.
[11:03.250 --> 11:04.250]  That sounds pretty nice.
[11:04.530 --> 11:07.330]  Uh, again, we've got that coldness from the cream cheese.
[11:07.330 --> 11:08.730]  That is a trend here amongst the stoners.
[11:08.730 --> 11:11.330]  We got to have something cold and delicious in our snacks.
[11:11.330 --> 11:15.810]  Uh, however, I do crave Twizzlers every so often and beef jerky has to be peppered.
[11:15.810 --> 11:18.050]  Oh, the beef jerky that has to be peppered.
[11:18.050 --> 11:20.210]  All this talk about munchies is giving me the munchies.
[11:20.210 --> 11:24.610]  Yeah, I'm sure there are several people right now that are pulling over the car, uh, stopping
[11:24.610 --> 11:27.090]  to get some snacks on the way to work cause we're fucking up their day.
[11:27.090 --> 11:28.090]  Sorry guys.
[11:28.090 --> 11:29.090]  I love you.
[11:29.090 --> 11:31.570]  Uh, be nice to the people in seven 11 early in the morning.
[11:31.570 --> 11:32.570]  Get it.
[11:32.570 --> 11:33.570]  The seven 11 show.
[11:33.890 --> 11:35.690]  We got seven 11 talking about munchies.
[11:35.690 --> 11:36.690]  Big cheers.
[11:36.690 --> 11:37.690]  Let's keep going.
[11:37.690 --> 11:39.410]  This one comes from my good friend, Billy Podunk.
[11:39.410 --> 11:40.410]  What's up you bad motherfucker.
[11:40.410 --> 11:42.650]  I hope things are great by the time you hear this.
[11:42.650 --> 11:46.450]  Uh, it says my favorites are something crunchy and savory.
[11:46.450 --> 11:47.530]  I understand that bro.
[11:47.530 --> 11:48.850]  I'm in that same boat.
[11:48.850 --> 11:51.050]  Uh, garlic and Parmesan, anything.
[11:51.050 --> 11:54.050]  Uh, those Boulder chips, the Parmesan Boulder chips.
[11:54.050 --> 11:55.050]  Those are fucking delicious.
[11:55.050 --> 11:56.610]  Uh, crunchy, savory.
[11:56.610 --> 11:57.610]  That's my sort of stuff.
[11:57.610 --> 12:00.610]  It does go on to say, I do also like some healthy snacks.
[12:00.730 --> 12:05.530]  One of my favorites is veggies and that hidden Valley ranch dry mix with the sour cream.
[12:05.530 --> 12:08.330]  This dude's got a specific, uh, dressing that he loves.
[12:08.330 --> 12:12.090]  Uh, it says I definitely eat way too much food when I get stone.
[12:12.090 --> 12:13.090]  There's no stopping me.
[12:13.090 --> 12:14.090]  I know that feeling, bro.
[12:14.090 --> 12:15.570]  I know that feeling.
[12:15.570 --> 12:16.970]  He said for regional snacks.
[12:16.970 --> 12:19.130]  Uh, of course, Billy is in Alaska.
[12:19.130 --> 12:20.650]  He's in a beautiful region of Alaska.
[12:20.650 --> 12:22.290]  I've seen where he lives up there.
[12:22.290 --> 12:27.090]  It says for regional snacks, smoked salmon bellies are one of my top choices.
[12:27.090 --> 12:29.970]  We don't really have fast food where I am.
[12:30.330 --> 12:32.330]  So he says, let's get stone and eat way too much food.
[12:32.330 --> 12:33.330]  Cheers, Billy podunk.
[12:33.330 --> 12:34.330]  Thank you for the great feedback.
[12:34.330 --> 12:36.330]  Also, bro, thank you for the great friendship.
[12:36.330 --> 12:40.810]  Um, we've become really good friends over the discord, uh, over social media, over a
[12:40.810 --> 12:41.810]  short period of time.
[12:41.810 --> 12:44.490]  Got nothing but love and respect for that dude, Billy podunk.
[12:44.490 --> 12:45.770]  So that's a good dude.
[12:45.770 --> 12:46.770]  Thank you for the feedback, bro.
[12:46.770 --> 12:47.770]  Uh, pay attention.
[12:47.770 --> 12:50.850]  That dude's going to be doing a lot of shit in the future.
[12:50.850 --> 12:52.450]  Then we move our way through the discord.
[12:52.450 --> 12:55.210]  We get some feedback from a guy known as gray beard.
[12:55.210 --> 12:57.290]  I owe a big shout out to my buddy gray beard.
[12:57.290 --> 12:59.010]  He built the discord.
[12:59.050 --> 13:00.050]  That's right.
[13:00.050 --> 13:03.530]  If you were on the discord server, you owe gray beard, a fist bump, a high five, a shout
[13:03.530 --> 13:05.170]  out, maybe a little kiss on the cheek.
[13:05.170 --> 13:06.730]  However you want to do it.
[13:06.730 --> 13:07.730]  Great kid.
[13:07.730 --> 13:08.730]  Good dude.
[13:08.730 --> 13:09.730]  Giant hog.
[13:09.730 --> 13:14.330]  He built the discord server and his comment says candy is my weakness.
[13:14.330 --> 13:15.890]  Sour gummy candy to be specific.
[13:15.890 --> 13:18.470]  I like savory to salty to sweet.
[13:18.470 --> 13:23.890]  If I could have all three, um, sour gummy candies and then savory, salty and sweet.
[13:23.890 --> 13:25.730]  So I'm not a fan of the gummy candy sort of stuff.
[13:25.730 --> 13:28.010]  I don't like digging that candy shit out of my teeth.
[13:28.010 --> 13:31.730]  I'm not into that kind of stuff, but salty and savory.
[13:31.730 --> 13:32.730]  Hell yeah, bro.
[13:32.730 --> 13:33.730]  And sweet.
[13:33.730 --> 13:35.650]  There's a checks mix that will fall right into that.
[13:35.650 --> 13:38.330]  It's like salted honey, something checks mix, bro.
[13:38.330 --> 13:40.970]  That is salty, sweet, crunchy, savory.
[13:40.970 --> 13:42.630]  It's all of the above.
[13:42.630 --> 13:46.250]  That one will definitely, uh, scratch that itch if you will.
[13:46.250 --> 13:48.170]  Then he says, I hate spending money on drinks.
[13:48.170 --> 13:51.810]  I drink water and I love crunchy, but not much of a cake guy.
[13:51.810 --> 13:52.810]  I get that.
[13:52.810 --> 13:55.930]  Uh, I do really enjoy being a stoner, being a talker.
[13:55.930 --> 13:56.930]  I love drinks.
[13:56.930 --> 14:00.450]  I'm going to talk about the things I love in a little bit, but I do spend a lot of money
[14:00.450 --> 14:01.690]  on delicious drinks.
[14:01.690 --> 14:03.290]  Perhaps that's why I stay.
[14:03.290 --> 14:04.290]  I'm a skinny dude.
[14:04.290 --> 14:08.050]  I'm six, five and under 200 pounds because I don't eat a lot of junk.
[14:08.050 --> 14:12.050]  I think most of my snacks are drinks, which means I get to just pee out most of it.
[14:12.050 --> 14:16.050]  Um, then he goes on to say a crunchy, but not much of a cake guy.
[14:16.050 --> 14:20.650]  Sometimes bro, a birthday cake, cupcakes, the cupcakes with fucking sprinkles on them
[14:20.650 --> 14:22.070]  at a gas station.
[14:22.070 --> 14:23.530]  That is one of my weaknesses.
[14:23.530 --> 14:24.530]  Oh yeah.
[14:24.850 --> 14:25.850]  Uh, healthy snacks.
[14:25.850 --> 14:27.370]  Usually peanuts or almonds, dude.
[14:27.370 --> 14:33.090]  I love pistachios, especially the pistachios that have been cracked already and they're
[14:33.090 --> 14:35.850]  coated in the tie, the roasted tie chili seasoning.
[14:35.850 --> 14:38.050]  Oh man, I'll eat the whole bag.
[14:38.050 --> 14:39.050]  Like the whole bag.
[14:39.050 --> 14:43.290]  Uh, it says, uh, also some kind of fruit or almonds or peanuts.
[14:43.290 --> 14:46.930]  I eat crap food when I get stoned and when not stoned, something I'm trying to get better
[14:46.930 --> 14:47.930]  at.
[14:47.930 --> 14:48.930]  Oh, let's see.
[14:48.930 --> 14:49.930]  I eat crap stone.
[14:49.930 --> 14:50.930]  Oh, he eats crap when he is stoned and not stoned.
[14:50.930 --> 14:51.930]  I get it, bro.
[14:51.930 --> 14:55.370]  It's like we're in America where they feed us and offer us all of this shit that we should
[14:55.370 --> 14:57.410]  not be eating and something you will notice.
[14:57.410 --> 14:58.410]  This is a weird political rant.
[14:58.410 --> 14:59.890]  I'm not going to go too far on.
[14:59.890 --> 15:03.290]  Uh, the cheaper the food, the worse it is for you.
[15:03.290 --> 15:07.450]  Like the worst shit is more affordable until you learn how to shop and eat like vegetarian
[15:07.450 --> 15:08.450]  shopping is cheap.
[15:08.450 --> 15:12.250]  Once you figured out fruits and vegetables and things to sustain rice is cheap, but yeah,
[15:12.250 --> 15:15.890]  they may, they really make it seem expensive to take care of yourself.
[15:15.890 --> 15:16.890]  Let's stay on track.
[15:16.890 --> 15:20.250]  Japanese and South Korean candy is the best candy in the world.
[15:20.250 --> 15:21.250]  Yes.
[15:21.250 --> 15:23.290]  One of my notes later is exotic turps.
[15:23.290 --> 15:27.530]  Uh, Cheetos used to come out with the cinnamon sugar puffs during Christmas to eat a whole
[15:27.530 --> 15:28.770]  bag of those in one sitting.
[15:28.770 --> 15:32.010]  I haven't ever seen those, bro, but, uh, that sounds like a great idea.
[15:32.010 --> 15:36.490]  That makes me think of the Taco Bell, uh, the fucking cinnamon Twisted Taco Bell, probably
[15:36.490 --> 15:38.890]  similar, but better than he said.
[15:38.890 --> 15:41.050]  Subs Jersey, Mike's Jimmy John's Penn station.
[15:41.050 --> 15:42.850]  I love subs, bro.
[15:42.850 --> 15:48.330]  Um, not to be a hater, but I'm a vegetarian and Jersey Mike's, uh, just fucking sucks.
[15:48.330 --> 15:50.450]  There's, I can eat grease and cheese.
[15:50.450 --> 15:51.930]  That's basically what I get offered in there.
[15:51.930 --> 15:53.210]  Would you like a grease and cheese sandwich?
[15:53.210 --> 15:55.490]  And I'm like, I'm going to hard pass on that shit.
[15:55.490 --> 15:57.850]  I can go get diarrhea somewhere else, but I get it.
[15:57.850 --> 16:01.530]  If you're into subs, uh, if you want to be shaggy and Scooby about your life, you go
[16:01.530 --> 16:03.250]  ahead and do your thing and enjoy it.
[16:03.250 --> 16:04.490]  Um, it does go on.
[16:04.490 --> 16:06.970]  There is more from my soil guy.
[16:06.970 --> 16:09.610]  You guys, I do have a lot of feedback, so we're going to get through these kind of quickly
[16:09.610 --> 16:11.730]  because I feel, I realized I am taking a long time.
[16:11.730 --> 16:15.970]  Uh, it says my favorite fast food when I'm stoned is the one someone got for me, uh,
[16:15.970 --> 16:17.210]  against my wishes.
[16:17.290 --> 16:21.170]  Uh, but because I can't think of any fast food I like it's there and it fits me.
[16:21.170 --> 16:23.810]  So this person basically is my soil guy friend here.
[16:23.810 --> 16:27.730]  Uh, this dude is indecisive, refuses to think, just wants food delivered.
[16:27.730 --> 16:31.570]  And since he's knows he's so indecisive, let me shut the fuck up and eat what is delivered.
[16:31.570 --> 16:32.850]  I can appreciate that, bro.
[16:32.850 --> 16:34.210]  You'll take whatever I'm having.
[16:34.210 --> 16:37.090]  I'll just order two and pass you one and hopefully you like it.
[16:37.090 --> 16:38.170]  That's easy enough for me, bro.
[16:38.170 --> 16:39.170]  That's adventurous.
[16:39.170 --> 16:41.450]  Uh, you may end up with some shit you don't want.
[16:41.450 --> 16:46.850]  This one I was waiting to run into a note like this, a reply like this, because it says
[16:46.850 --> 16:51.290]  there was this sour tangerine homemade weed gummy that someone gave me once.
[16:51.290 --> 16:54.210]  I should never be allowed around those when I'm high.
[16:54.210 --> 16:57.610]  Uh, it says they were so good I would probably never come down.
[16:57.610 --> 17:02.450]  So I guess sour sweets, infused foods, fried snacks, dude, fried shit is good.
[17:02.450 --> 17:05.090]  You could deep fry anything and I might eat it.
[17:05.090 --> 17:07.570]  Um, stacking different flavors of Pringles.
[17:07.570 --> 17:08.570]  Huh?
[17:08.570 --> 17:09.570]  That's magical right there, dude.
[17:09.570 --> 17:12.250]  Uh, spicy jalapeno barbecue ranch or whatever.
[17:12.250 --> 17:14.810]  Most Asian food boogers by said boogers.
[17:14.810 --> 17:15.810]  And it says burgers.
[17:15.810 --> 17:19.010]  If you eat your boogers, I'm down, but please don't invite me.
[17:19.010 --> 17:21.730]  Um, sushi, dim sum, soda, bro.
[17:21.730 --> 17:23.490]  You need just about fucking everything.
[17:23.490 --> 17:26.170]  Hard cider, pasta, carbs, comfort food.
[17:26.170 --> 17:27.730]  This guy is down to eat everything.
[17:27.730 --> 17:29.090]  Uh, maybe this is not a guy.
[17:29.090 --> 17:30.090]  This could be a gal.
[17:30.090 --> 17:32.650]  They're called Aria Sin, Erra Sin.
[17:32.650 --> 17:33.730]  I can't read.
[17:33.730 --> 17:36.730]  And I, uh, I apologize for assuming your gender.
[17:36.730 --> 17:37.730]  It's 2022.
[17:37.730 --> 17:38.730]  I should have known better.
[17:38.730 --> 17:40.810]  Uh, I do see the rainbows and the icon.
[17:40.810 --> 17:41.810]  I'm confused.
[17:41.810 --> 17:45.810]  Uh, it says there is nothing seasonal that I won't make any time of the year.
[17:45.810 --> 17:47.810]  If I want it, I do appreciate that.
[17:47.810 --> 17:50.650]  The thing I wanted to talk about is those damn edibles.
[17:50.650 --> 17:52.130]  Uh, I do the same thing.
[17:52.130 --> 17:53.610]  I'll have some delicious edibles.
[17:53.610 --> 17:55.530]  There's a company called Coda that makes chocolates.
[17:55.530 --> 17:58.850]  They're way overpriced, but they're a decadent medicated chocolates.
[17:58.850 --> 18:02.210]  I also have some peanut butter cookies over there that will fucking ruin your life.
[18:02.210 --> 18:05.410]  Um, you eat these Coda chocolates and you're like, that was really good.
[18:05.410 --> 18:06.410]  I don't feel high.
[18:06.410 --> 18:07.410]  I'm gonna eat more of those chocolates.
[18:07.410 --> 18:08.410]  And then guess what?
[18:08.410 --> 18:09.410]  You're fucked up.
[18:09.410 --> 18:10.410]  But the chocolates are so good.
[18:10.410 --> 18:11.410]  I'm eating more of them.
[18:11.410 --> 18:13.410]  Uh, shout out to my friend, Karen.
[18:13.410 --> 18:15.410]  Uh, Karen passed away a couple of years ago.
[18:15.410 --> 18:16.410]  Love you, Karen.
[18:16.410 --> 18:17.410]  Rest in peace.
[18:17.410 --> 18:22.210]  Karen would made, uh, would make fudge and carrot cake that you could not get enough
[18:22.210 --> 18:23.210]  of.
[18:23.210 --> 18:25.770]  They would have to put electrodes around it because I would constantly be reaching into
[18:25.770 --> 18:27.750]  the fudge and taking little bites of it.
[18:27.750 --> 18:29.650]  And I would forget that it was medicated.
[18:29.650 --> 18:32.690]  And by halfway through the day, my eyes would be so heavy that I couldn't function.
[18:32.690 --> 18:34.930]  I would have the munchies and a lot like our friend here.
[18:34.930 --> 18:39.290]  Uh, I would keep reaching in and going back for more of that medicated fudge.
[18:39.290 --> 18:41.010]  I would just be goofy by the end of the day.
[18:41.010 --> 18:42.010]  Things would be hard to handle.
[18:42.010 --> 18:46.210]  Uh, but I worked at a dispensary where the owner made medicated fudge and encouraged
[18:46.210 --> 18:47.210]  me to eat it.
[18:47.210 --> 18:48.210]  So it was her fault.
[18:48.210 --> 18:49.210]  Love you, Karen.
[18:49.210 --> 18:51.010]  Uh, sorry for, uh, being so high at work all the time.
[18:51.010 --> 18:52.010]  It was your fault, dude.
[18:52.010 --> 18:53.010]  All right, let's keep going.
[18:53.010 --> 18:55.890]  Uh, I thought that's funny though, when you get high and keep eating the edibles and you
[18:55.890 --> 18:59.130]  keep getting higher and you keep eating the edibles and you're like, what's going on here,
[18:59.130 --> 19:00.130]  man?
[19:00.130 --> 19:01.130]  You fall into that loop.
[19:01.130 --> 19:02.130]  I love it.
[19:02.130 --> 19:03.290]  The, the weed edible matrix.
[19:03.290 --> 19:04.370]  All right.
[19:04.370 --> 19:08.510]  We do have another one that came from snazzy sneakers, big up to our friend snazzy sneakers.
[19:08.510 --> 19:10.750]  That last message came from era sin.
[19:10.750 --> 19:14.030]  I apologize for assuming your gender, uh, big up, much respect.
[19:14.030 --> 19:15.350]  You can correct me politely.
[19:15.350 --> 19:17.010]  Let me know who I'm talking to.
[19:17.010 --> 19:18.670]  If you care, it goes on.
[19:18.670 --> 19:23.190]  It says, uh, from snazzy, my wife's cookies dunked in a hot cup of coffee is going to
[19:23.190 --> 19:27.870]  give me diabetes, but I will do it with a smile on my face, bro.
[19:27.870 --> 19:28.870]  Isn't that how it is?
[19:28.870 --> 19:29.870]  Sometimes snacks are so good.
[19:29.870 --> 19:34.150]  You're like, yeah, I'm taking fucking six weeks off my life with every cookie, but guess
[19:34.150 --> 19:35.150]  what?
[19:35.150 --> 19:36.150]  I don't want to get old anyway.
[19:36.150 --> 19:37.150]  Uh, then it goes on.
[19:37.150 --> 19:40.950]  It says, uh, sweet and spicy pickles are probably the only thing resembling healthy food that
[19:40.950 --> 19:42.750]  I reach for when I'm high.
[19:42.750 --> 19:45.190]  That's such a good debate is a pickle, a spicy snack.
[19:45.190 --> 19:46.190]  Who cares?
[19:46.190 --> 19:47.190]  It's so good.
[19:47.190 --> 19:49.470]  And we're back to the trend, cold and refreshing.
[19:49.470 --> 19:52.950]  I noticed the potheads like a cold and refreshing snack.
[19:52.950 --> 19:56.490]  All of that cold and refreshing snack talk makes me need to hit a drink of this cold
[19:56.490 --> 19:58.070]  and refreshing kombucha here.
[19:58.070 --> 19:59.070]  We'll talk about that in a minute.
[19:59.070 --> 20:00.150]  I'm going to take a drink, not edit this.
[20:00.150 --> 20:10.270]  You guys hang out, drink something while I'm doing it.
[20:10.270 --> 20:15.550]  I really love the feeling of carbonation going down the throat when I'm good and blazed.
[20:15.550 --> 20:17.670]  I feel like, uh, what's that soap with the scrubbing bubbles.
[20:17.670 --> 20:20.750]  I feel like it just gets in there and knocks out the, uh, what do you call it earlier?
[20:20.750 --> 20:25.030]  The pasties just gets in there and scrubs out the pasties, the cotton mouth, nothing
[20:25.030 --> 20:26.630]  like some good kombucha bubbles.
[20:26.630 --> 20:30.590]  I was, I used to be an avid Dr. Pepper addict.
[20:30.590 --> 20:35.950]  I would drink a ridiculous and embarrassingly gross amount of Dr. Pepper every day.
[20:35.950 --> 20:39.110]  I was doing a, uh, kind of a battle.
[20:39.110 --> 20:40.430]  How high can I get now?
[20:40.430 --> 20:43.750]  I need to battle it out or even it out with caffeine and I'm too caffeinated.
[20:43.750 --> 20:44.750]  Let's dab more.
[20:44.750 --> 20:45.750]  Now let's drink more caffeine.
[20:45.750 --> 20:48.550]  And by the end of the day, I'd be fucking anxious and shaky.
[20:48.550 --> 20:49.830]  And I called it blown out.
[20:49.830 --> 20:51.070]  My mind couldn't fucking focus.
[20:51.070 --> 20:55.430]  I couldn't make eye contact with anybody because I was so high and so caffeinated that I wasn't
[20:55.430 --> 20:58.030]  either one and my body was just fried.
[20:58.030 --> 21:04.470]  I haven't had caffeine and Dr. Pepper, uh, in probably two and a half, nearly three years.
[21:04.470 --> 21:06.830]  I think if I've got my time, right.
[21:06.830 --> 21:10.150]  Something I've noticed is in that time period, my thoughts are more clear.
[21:10.150 --> 21:11.430]  I have less anxiety.
[21:11.430 --> 21:15.830]  My panic attacks are almost gone, much less frequent.
[21:15.830 --> 21:19.070]  So that high fructose corn syrup, I said high fructose corn syrup.
[21:19.070 --> 21:20.070]  I apologize for that.
[21:20.070 --> 21:23.350]  Uh, high fructose corn syrup and the caffeine in there.
[21:23.350 --> 21:24.350]  I'm just exaggerating.
[21:24.350 --> 21:29.070]  Now we're definitely fucking up my mental wellbeing, my body, my physical.
[21:29.070 --> 21:30.070]  I feel better.
[21:30.070 --> 21:32.350]  I've got more energy with less caffeine.
[21:32.350 --> 21:35.630]  Um, now I'm just talking about weird health tips with Rasta Jeff, but that is something
[21:35.630 --> 21:36.630]  I definitely noticed.
[21:36.630 --> 21:40.870]  Uh, so if you're eating like crap and not taking care of yourself, it could definitely
[21:40.870 --> 21:43.750]  help you feel better just to make a few minor adjustments.
[21:43.750 --> 21:44.910]  Just take out some of the crap.
[21:44.910 --> 21:45.910]  You don't even have to add anything.
[21:45.910 --> 21:46.910]  You don't have to do anything.
[21:46.910 --> 21:48.190]  Just take out some of the crap.
[21:48.190 --> 21:51.270]  Replace the Dr. Pepper with a bottle of water or something like that.
[21:51.270 --> 21:52.670]  All right, let's get back onto it.
[21:52.670 --> 21:53.670]  That's enough preaching.
[21:53.670 --> 21:54.670]  You didn't come here for the preachy shit.
[21:54.670 --> 21:56.590]  You came here for the, the munchie talk.
[21:56.590 --> 22:01.150]  Our friend Snazzy also says bacon wrapped cream cheese stuffed jalapenos.
[22:01.150 --> 22:03.710]  Yeah, that's a hell of a snack right there, bro.
[22:03.710 --> 22:06.950]  That's a, I don't eat the bacon part, but that sounds good.
[22:06.950 --> 22:10.990]  It says there's this snow cone and frozen custard place down the street from me where
[22:10.990 --> 22:16.930]  I used to live called S and J's that has the best goddamn concrete Sundays I could smash
[22:16.930 --> 22:17.930]  all day.
[22:17.930 --> 22:21.710]  It sounds like you fell in love, bro.
[22:21.710 --> 22:22.710]  What's in there?
[22:22.710 --> 22:23.710]  I might try one.
[22:23.710 --> 22:24.710]  It goes on.
[22:24.710 --> 22:27.390]  It says those strawberry hard candies with the chewy center that are always in Grammy's
[22:27.390 --> 22:28.390]  candy jar.
[22:28.390 --> 22:30.030]  Dude, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[22:30.030 --> 22:31.030]  I talk about that.
[22:31.030 --> 22:32.590]  That's what strawberry starburst smells like.
[22:32.590 --> 22:33.590]  Those candies are delicious.
[22:34.470 --> 22:35.470]  That gooey texture in the middle.
[22:35.470 --> 22:36.470]  Oh yeah.
[22:36.470 --> 22:37.470]  Now that I'm getting older, I can't eat shit like that.
[22:37.470 --> 22:41.470]  I feel like those candies are actively trying to pull out my teeth as I'm eating them.
[22:41.470 --> 22:42.630]  So I don't eat that kind of shit.
[22:42.630 --> 22:43.630]  But yeah.
[22:43.630 --> 22:48.150]  Then he said a plain ass ice water is my drink of choice, but I understand that.
[22:48.150 --> 22:51.030]  I try to drink a lot of water.
[22:51.030 --> 22:53.550]  Water is super refreshing for a guy that talks so much.
[22:53.550 --> 22:56.510]  I definitely need a lot of water, a lot of voice lubrication.
[22:56.510 --> 22:57.510]  I understand that.
[22:57.510 --> 22:58.670]  So big up on a lot of water.
[22:58.670 --> 23:00.070]  You guys drink a lot of water.
[23:00.070 --> 23:01.070]  You will feel better.
[23:01.070 --> 23:02.070]  Your brain will function.
[23:02.070 --> 23:03.870]  Your body will function better.
[23:03.870 --> 23:05.030]  Water is good for you.
[23:05.030 --> 23:09.110]  And there it is again, that cold, refreshing snack for the potheads.
[23:09.110 --> 23:10.230]  All right.
[23:10.230 --> 23:12.350]  These next few replies I'm going to burn through.
[23:12.350 --> 23:13.350]  It says responses.
[23:13.350 --> 23:15.150]  These are from Instagram.
[23:15.150 --> 23:16.550]  I did post the same question.
[23:16.550 --> 23:18.590]  What do you like to eat when you're blazed on Instagram?
[23:18.590 --> 23:20.230]  I'm quickly going to go through a lot of these.
[23:20.230 --> 23:21.230]  I may skip some.
[23:21.230 --> 23:23.390]  Then we're going to talk a little bit about what I like.
[23:23.390 --> 23:27.610]  I feel like this episode has gotten longer than I had anticipated and preferred.
[23:27.610 --> 23:28.610]  Not a big deal.
[23:29.290 --> 23:30.290]  I'm going to keep going through these really long shows.
[23:30.290 --> 23:33.310]  What do I have up here that I want to make sure not to miss?
[23:33.310 --> 23:37.930]  Before we go that far, let me cover this last note so I can scroll.
[23:37.930 --> 23:42.690]  Something I've noticed is super popular and this is just a side random branch here.
[23:42.690 --> 23:45.810]  I have been frequenting sneaker shops.
[23:45.810 --> 23:47.650]  I go to a lot of sneaker stores.
[23:47.650 --> 23:48.970]  I buy a lot of hoodies and sneakers.
[23:48.970 --> 23:50.690]  It's just something I enjoy.
[23:50.690 --> 23:55.730]  While I'm there, I noticed that all of them have a small section of what they are calling
[23:55.730 --> 23:57.270]  exotic snacks.
[23:57.270 --> 24:03.050]  We've got a little refrigerator with a bunch of crazy looking sodas and drinks and exotic
[24:03.050 --> 24:04.930]  snacks is exactly what it is.
[24:04.930 --> 24:06.390]  Exotic Terps.
[24:06.390 --> 24:12.150]  There are like Cheetos and Doritos and Lay's chips from other countries with crazy exotic
[24:12.150 --> 24:14.990]  foreign flavors we've never experienced.
[24:14.990 --> 24:17.950]  There are candies, cookies.
[24:17.950 --> 24:18.950]  What did I try the other day?
[24:18.950 --> 24:22.390]  It was a Faygo Rocket Popsicle Soda.
[24:22.390 --> 24:27.310]  It gave me the most tremendous burps and I haven't had anything with that much flavor
[24:27.310 --> 24:31.410]  in it in a long long time but that shit was tremendously delicious.
[24:31.410 --> 24:37.630]  So this exotic imported Chinese candy, Chinese Terps thing seems to be really popular right
[24:37.630 --> 24:43.950]  now and at the sneaker shops I frequent they are charging like $18-$25 for a bottle of
[24:43.950 --> 24:46.230]  beverages that is the size of this water bottle.
[24:46.230 --> 24:50.950]  Just a normal maybe a little bigger you know it's your 16 maybe 24 ounce soda bottle for
[24:50.950 --> 24:51.950]  $18 or $24.
[24:51.950 --> 24:56.830]  They've got some Doritos in there that flavors I've never seen before.
[24:56.830 --> 24:59.430]  Flavors that are, I buy some of them and try them out.
[24:59.430 --> 25:03.390]  Sometimes my friends own the shop in a couple of locations so we'll all just throw down
[25:03.390 --> 25:06.950]  a couple of bucks for a bag and we'll open it up and I'll just try a couple of Doritos.
[25:06.950 --> 25:09.030]  Some of them are amazing.
[25:09.030 --> 25:10.790]  There's one with tacos.
[25:10.790 --> 25:11.950]  I think it's Chinese writing.
[25:11.950 --> 25:12.950]  I really am not sure.
[25:12.950 --> 25:18.190]  It looks Chinese to me and it's some kind of Doritos and they've got a taco on the picture.
[25:18.190 --> 25:21.870]  It's taco flavored Doritos right but not the taco we get here.
[25:21.870 --> 25:25.830]  This one tasted like I was like crunch and I was like okay it tastes like a taco then
[25:25.830 --> 25:30.190]  I was like nah bro there's beef in there and I kept chewing up the Dorito and I was like
[25:30.190 --> 25:35.350]  there's the lettuce and there's the cheese and there's the salsa and there's a little
[25:35.350 --> 25:39.950]  bit of cilantro coming in right now like I tasted every component of a taco in these
[25:39.950 --> 25:40.950]  fucking Doritos.
[25:40.950 --> 25:43.510]  So these exotic Terps are getting real popular.
[25:43.510 --> 25:44.510]  It's really fun.
[25:44.510 --> 25:47.590]  I like just I'll buy a couple of random things and have a few bros over and we'll come take
[25:47.990 --> 25:52.030]  some dabs and dab out and then I'll be like anybody want to try some fucking Chinese Doritos?
[25:52.030 --> 25:54.910]  We can't even read what it says on the label and we'll all try it and see what it tastes
[25:54.910 --> 25:55.910]  like.
[25:55.910 --> 25:56.910]  Fun times.
[25:56.910 --> 25:59.750]  Some cookies, some other weird snacks, some things with Pokemon on the label.
[25:59.750 --> 26:02.070]  I had no idea what they were but they were delicious.
[26:02.070 --> 26:03.870]  Anyway that shit is super popular.
[26:03.870 --> 26:08.150]  Now that I've rambled about that part let's get into these Instagram responses.
[26:08.150 --> 26:11.870]  Our friend not thrilled said fruit I like to taste the life contained in it.
[26:11.870 --> 26:16.030]  I'm not sure if that is beautiful or if you're a psycho.
[26:16.030 --> 26:17.470]  Either way I like it.
[26:17.510 --> 26:21.910]  My buddy Lobster Bush said I like to eat cereal and we're noticing both of those trends.
[26:21.910 --> 26:24.710]  Something refreshing and moist for the pothead mouth.

[26:55.550 --> 26:56.910]  We got a bowl of cap and crunch.
[26:56.910 --> 27:02.030]  That sounds great but go slow so you don't fuck up your mouth or do you let it get soggy.
[27:02.030 --> 27:06.530]  Chips and queso but I'm not in Texas anymore and NorCal has been sleeping on this delicacy
[27:06.530 --> 27:07.710]  for far too long.
[27:07.710 --> 27:11.510]  Bro if you can't make chips and queso you're sleeping.

[27:22.870 --> 27:25.470]  That's a good snack but that's something that would be very limited.
[27:25.470 --> 27:27.870]  How many of those can you eat?
[27:27.870 --> 27:28.870]  I know what you're talking about.
[27:28.870 --> 27:31.470]  The big green olives with the nice garlic clove in the middle.

[33:43.510 --> 33:48.110]  about it I already mentioned I like kombucha for the bubbles I talk a lot I
[33:48.110 --> 33:51.670]  got to keep the voice fresh I got to stay hydrated I got to keep moving I like
[33:51.670 --> 33:56.270]  kombucha a lot people have asked me a lot about kombucha and advice about
[33:56.270 --> 34:00.670]  kombucha kombucha is a very acquired taste there are lots of different
[34:00.670 --> 34:04.670]  varieties flavors types of kombucha this one I'm showing to the camera here is
[34:04.670 --> 34:09.150]  Kavita brand nobody pays me I buy kombucha at the store just like
[34:09.150 --> 34:14.750]  everybody else Kavita ke vita master brew kombucha this is a ginger flavored
[34:14.750 --> 34:19.570]  one of my favorites I really enjoy the tart cherry from this brand this is what
[34:19.570 --> 34:25.650]  I kind of call gas station kombucha this isn't real real high in probiotics
[34:25.650 --> 34:30.930]  real fermented flavored this is kind of a kombucha soda entry-level amateur
[34:30.930 --> 34:35.330]  kombucha if I'm at the gas station if options are limited if the stores are
[34:35.330 --> 34:40.170]  low on inventory these are refreshing they taste good it's not a soda it's a
[34:40.170 --> 34:43.010]  good snack it's a good drink for the day I like the bubbles a lot when I'm
[34:43.010 --> 34:46.650]  blazed but if you want to be healthy and if you're drinking kombucha for health
[34:46.810 --> 34:52.130]  reasons I definitely prefer GT's brand kombucha they make a lot of different
[34:52.130 --> 34:56.570]  great kombuchas there's the raw and unfiltered this one's organic and
[34:56.570 --> 35:00.210]  unpasteurized a lot of them say synergy here you'll see a lot of different words
[35:00.210 --> 35:05.730]  this blue flavor is one of my favorites they said it was going to be seasonal we
[35:05.730 --> 35:09.690]  kind of demanded that it was not seasonal I think they heard us this one
[35:09.690 --> 35:12.890]  is called sacred life this one has without reading I do remember I think
[35:13.010 --> 35:17.930]  it's got kiwi juice coconut water and ginger and then all the probiotics from
[35:17.930 --> 35:23.770]  a kombucha in there this is more of a potent fermented pungent sort of a
[35:23.770 --> 35:27.410]  kombucha this one it takes a little getting used to if you're not into that
[35:27.410 --> 35:30.850]  if you can drink a good beer if you're into fermented things you will enjoy
[35:30.850 --> 35:35.090]  this it may take some getting used to some adjustment this is more of the
[35:35.090 --> 35:39.330]  entry-level brand if you try one kombucha and you don't like it that
[35:39.330 --> 35:43.250]  doesn't mean you don't like kombuchas every brand does it differently different
[35:43.250 --> 35:48.010]  flavors dilution styles some are real bold and like dark beer kind of flavored
[35:48.010 --> 35:51.930]  some tastes like fucking bum wine and fruit juice there are a lot of options
[35:51.930 --> 35:55.650]  don't let it turn you down turn you off also don't force it if you don't like
[35:55.650 --> 35:58.850]  it you just don't like it but I really enjoy a good kombucha after all that
[35:58.850 --> 36:02.410]  talk I'm gonna take a hit of this ginger kombucha just cuz I can't resist anymore
[36:02.410 --> 36:12.110]  oh yeah those good bubbles good refreshing ginger bite it's got it like
[36:12.110 --> 36:16.310]  a nice bite to it and that fermented flavor I got some German blood in me
[36:16.310 --> 36:19.070]  there's got to be some Norwegian some Dutch in me something like that maybe
[36:19.070 --> 36:23.670]  some Scottish I got a red beard I don't know exactly I haven't done the 23 and
[36:23.670 --> 36:28.390]  me yet but those people from those regions tend to enjoy fermented type
[36:28.390 --> 36:31.910]  food so it only makes sense that I would like a kombucha also I don't drink
[36:31.910 --> 36:35.710]  because I have a problem regulating my alcohol content I've been drinking years
[36:35.710 --> 36:40.190]  but I love a good dark beer so it's only likely that I would enjoy a kombucha
[36:40.190 --> 36:45.830]  let's move on what do I like to eat for snacks bro lately I've been munching
[36:45.830 --> 36:49.510]  pistachios they're healthy I don't feel like I'm eating shit they're not super
[36:49.510 --> 36:54.830]  sugary they're not bad for my teeth they satiate hunger they give me energy I'm
[36:54.830 --> 36:58.030]  sure there's like some sort of nutrients some sort of selenium or selenium or
[36:58.030 --> 37:01.350]  some something's got to be good for my hair teeth nails and eyes and all those
[37:01.350 --> 37:06.870]  pistachios the Thai chili pistachios are divine I can eat the whole damn however
[37:06.870 --> 37:10.950]  big the bag is I can eat it all on a drive on a road trip during a movie
[37:10.950 --> 37:15.990]  let's crunch down on some pistachios I like depending on the mood the
[37:15.990 --> 37:20.070]  environment the situation I really like spicy snacks if I'm hanging out the lady
[37:20.070 --> 37:24.430]  watching a movie obviously I'm not going 100% spicy I'm not gonna do the garlic
[37:24.430 --> 37:27.510]  and onion II type stuff that I would enjoy if I'm hanging out with the lady
[37:27.510 --> 37:30.510]  if I'm at the house by myself like there's nobody here I'm gonna crunch
[37:30.510 --> 37:34.230]  down on some garlic and Parmesan boulder chips later but I like spicy
[37:34.230 --> 37:38.350]  crunchy savory sort of snacks or something I mostly go for something that
[37:38.350 --> 37:42.110]  makes me feel I said a moment ago fool and satiated but not like a piece of
[37:42.110 --> 37:47.790]  shit like I'm just eating useless calories and feeding my body crap now
[37:47.790 --> 37:52.150]  with that being said um sometimes if I'm on the road I've talked about this I
[37:52.150 --> 37:56.230]  like to get cupcakes and shit like that that's my excuse just driving from
[37:56.230 --> 38:00.550]  Boulder to Pueblo or Denver to Pueblo or wherever I'm wherever I might be going
[38:00.550 --> 38:03.790]  that weekend coming back from a concert or something all the restaurants are
[38:03.790 --> 38:07.870]  closed I didn't plan ahead Chiba Hut was closed I love some good Chiba Hut
[38:07.870 --> 38:11.310]  when I'm blaze shout out to Chiba Hut but if I didn't get some Chiba Hut if we
[38:11.310 --> 38:15.270]  missed the opportunity for Chiba Hut or fuzzies tacos or something that's what
[38:15.270 --> 38:19.190]  I'm gonna go to the gas station get some cupcakes or I like to try like different
[38:19.190 --> 38:21.950]  kind of energy bars and stuff but those are overpriced and they're still that's
[38:21.950 --> 38:25.750]  just a candy bar you're just eating shit anyway so you'll often see me get like
[38:25.750 --> 38:30.630]  some cool ranch Doritos maybe some kind of garlicky spicy crunchy potato chips
[38:30.630 --> 38:34.150]  or something like that and then I'll grab like a cupcake I mentioned earlier
[38:34.150 --> 38:38.030]  I like those birthday cake cupcakes I really like the orange cupcakes I may
[38:38.030 --> 38:42.070]  sound crazy but the orange flavored cupcakes are great the cake is good it's
[38:42.070 --> 38:45.070]  always nice and moist to get that creamy center and then the frosting it's got
[38:45.070 --> 38:49.230]  like a little just a texture that I enjoy that's really nice for me I don't
[38:49.230 --> 38:52.770]  do candy stuff I've said that I'm not into like the sweet tarts and crunchy
[38:52.770 --> 38:57.910]  candy gummy candy suckers that's not for me no nerd ropes none of that shit
[38:57.910 --> 39:03.310]  sometimes you may see me much a brownie if the brownies are right a brownie
[39:03.310 --> 39:06.790]  corner with a little bit of crunch in that texture I'm down with the brownie
[39:06.790 --> 39:11.870]  but I really try to stay away from that stuff drinks I said that I drink a lot
[39:11.870 --> 39:18.150]  of drinks a lot of my snacks are drinks I cannot drink blue stuff if you have a
[39:18.150 --> 39:21.710]  Sonic where you live Sonic is a place where they serve drinks and food and
[39:21.710 --> 39:26.630]  it's fast food people like to get a blue coconut slush or they have blue coconut
[39:26.630 --> 39:31.510]  drinks I am allergic to the blue food coloring or something it will make me
[39:31.510 --> 39:37.030]  projectile vomit like a fucking dragon can't do blue drinks I try to avoid
[39:37.030 --> 39:42.590]  caffeine like I said I cut out the dr. pepper years ago I do spoil myself when
[39:42.590 --> 39:46.870]  I go to comedy works they have this bottled root beer it's caffeine free but
[39:46.870 --> 39:50.910]  that is as close to drinking like a sugary shitty soda that I've let myself
[39:50.910 --> 39:57.990]  get in a while varieties of kombucha and teas and coconut water you guys
[39:57.990 --> 40:02.910]  coconut water I love the vita cocoa pressed coconut the other coconut water
[40:02.910 --> 40:07.470]  is good the pressed coconut water is fucking delicious there's nothing more
[40:07.470 --> 40:11.950]  hydrating more refreshing than coconut water don't drink too much of it it can
[40:11.950 --> 40:15.790]  have it may come out the other end a little more quickly than you anticipated
[40:15.790 --> 40:20.470]  if you drink too much but the coconut water fucking divine super delicious
[40:20.470 --> 40:24.230]  when you're blazed it just like that cotton mouth is all yeah and you hit the
[40:24.230 --> 40:26.790]  coconut water it's just like your mouth goes ba la la la la you're just
[40:26.790 --> 40:32.830]  refreshed I love it um coconut water kombucha is random teas drink a lot of
[40:32.830 --> 40:37.270]  yogi tea a lot of celestial seasoning teas just to keep the throat in line to
[40:37.270 --> 40:39.990]  get some herbs and different sort of supplements into the body things like
[40:39.990 --> 40:43.630]  that I think it's good for you to drink tea especially when you talk as much as
[40:43.630 --> 40:48.030]  I do the weather is crazy here I smoke a lot of cannabis and I'm around a lot of
[40:48.030 --> 40:51.950]  people so vitamins teas things like that just try to keep myself boosted up
[40:51.950 --> 40:59.150]  there's a place near me that sells a peanut butter chia banana smoothie
[40:59.150 --> 41:03.590]  fucking oh my god dude if they weren't nine bucks I drink two of them a day
[41:03.590 --> 41:07.070]  those things are fucking delicious I love that we're gonna talk about fast
[41:07.070 --> 41:09.190]  food and food and then we're gonna get the fuck out of here you guys I know
[41:09.190 --> 41:13.230]  I've been going on for a long time I really like to eat when I get blazed I
[41:13.230 --> 41:17.390]  like food that I could just shove in my mouth there's something primal something
[41:17.430 --> 41:20.990]  just fucking rawr about me that when I get good and blazed and you're like it's
[41:20.990 --> 41:24.990]  eat time I'm like is it eat time or is it like eat time like no it's eat time
[41:24.990 --> 41:30.150]  let's do this I can murder a big-ass vegetarian Chipotle burrito like it's
[41:30.150 --> 41:35.230]  nothing we could do Qdoba if that's the option I like burritos vegetarian style
[41:35.230 --> 41:38.830]  burritos that I could just pick up and shove in my mouth the more food in my
[41:38.830 --> 41:42.790]  mouth at one time in that situation the better kind of become a savage a big dog
[41:42.790 --> 41:46.030]  a mountain lion a bear whatever you want to call me at that point love that sort
[41:46.030 --> 41:49.390]  of stuff some like Chipotle or some kind of good tacos a burrito something
[41:49.390 --> 41:53.870]  like that I'm down with it a nice savage burrito that fucking quesadilla
[41:53.870 --> 42:00.150]  from savage burrito I'm in um Thai food I love Asian food Thai food Indian food
[42:00.150 --> 42:05.950]  Chinese food Korean food all that sort of stuff love all of that sort of shit I
[42:05.950 --> 42:10.990]  like to go to a Thai food restaurant and order two maybe three maybe four entrees
[42:10.990 --> 42:14.590]  and just put them if I got a date and where we know each other we'll just put
[42:14.590 --> 42:17.870]  four meals on the tray on the table and we'll just experiment and see what's
[42:17.870 --> 42:20.750]  good and we're gonna like something we're not gonna like something love
[42:20.750 --> 42:25.630]  ordering multiple entrees are just finding out what I like and then I can
[42:25.630 --> 42:28.710]  eat so I'll just finish it all if you don't like it bro I'll fucking eat it
[42:28.710 --> 42:33.390]  don't worry all right so I think that kind of wraps up my rambling episode
[42:33.390 --> 42:37.030]  about munchies this was much longer than I had anticipated I don't think there's
