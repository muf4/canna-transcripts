[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Hey everyone, this is Dab and Branny and you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:11.000 --> 00:15.000]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[00:15.000 --> 00:21.000]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit.
[00:21.000 --> 00:23.000]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.000]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  Before you going back.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.000]  Way back.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  As we go a little something like this. Hit it.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.000]  It's Thursday and that means it's time for another Throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  Before we get to the old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.000]  If I mention any advertising, any giveaways, any promotions or any contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  I want to thank you guys for listening and with no further ado,
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.000]  here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:01.000 --> 01:18.030]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[01:18.030 --> 01:21.030]  It's time for episode number 179 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:21.030 --> 01:25.030]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:25.030 --> 01:30.030]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:30.030 --> 01:34.030]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:34.030 --> 01:37.030]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:37.030 --> 01:39.030]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:39.030 --> 01:41.030]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:41.030 --> 01:45.030]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[01:45.030 --> 01:47.030]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:47.030 --> 01:51.030]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:53.030 --> 01:56.030]  Yeah, I hope you guys are joining me on a smoke session right now.
[01:56.030 --> 01:59.030]  I just got done smoking some huge dabs of Cascade Shatter.
[01:59.030 --> 02:01.030]  The cascade was grown by me.
[02:01.030 --> 02:04.030]  The extraction was done by our friend, the Barefoot Grower.
[02:04.030 --> 02:11.030]  And I am smoking through my Hitman Hammerhead Rig with a brand new Quartz Banger from our friends at Elevate Glass.
[02:11.030 --> 02:13.030]  Big shout out to our friends at Elevate. I stopped by Elevate today.
[02:13.030 --> 02:17.030]  I had to replace a few nails and carb caps and such.
[02:17.030 --> 02:21.030]  I went in there thinking I was going to buy two things and I walked out there with a whole bag of goodies.
[02:21.030 --> 02:24.030]  Nice work you guys. You took all my money today.
[02:24.030 --> 02:27.030]  Big shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass at 517 South Dahoan.
[02:27.030 --> 02:32.030]  Go visit them. If you need a new rig, if you need a carb cap, if you need a nail, if you need an e-nail,
[02:32.030 --> 02:34.030]  they had all kinds of great new shit in there today.
[02:34.030 --> 02:39.030]  If you need an e-nail that you can operate with your iPhone, you can change the lighting scheme and have a light of every color on top of it.
[02:39.030 --> 02:44.030]  And you can open up this app on your phone and you can make that thing look like a damn light show at a Phish concert.
[02:44.030 --> 02:47.030]  It's pretty awesome. So, shout out to our friends at Elevate. Go check them out.
[02:47.030 --> 02:49.030]  517 South Dahoan in Colorado Springs.
[02:49.030 --> 02:53.030]  Also, since we're doing shout outs, huge shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:53.030 --> 02:57.030]  You guys, I'm wearing this Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodie and I am nice and warm.
[02:57.030 --> 03:01.030]  It is super cold here in Colorado, but I am not shivering at all.
[03:01.030 --> 03:06.030]  These hoodies look great. If you need some artwork done, if you need shirts, if you need hoodies, if you need stickers, if you need hat pins,
[03:06.030 --> 03:09.030]  I highly recommend my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[03:09.030 --> 03:12.030]  That's right, HandmadeApparel.biz for all your custom printing needs.
[03:12.030 --> 03:16.030]  Check them out. Let them know that you listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast and tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[03:16.030 --> 03:21.030]  They will take very good care of you getting all of your printing work done.
[03:21.030 --> 03:27.030]  Also, since we're doing shout outs, holy crap, you guys, I've been talking about Patreon for the past few weeks on the podcast.
[03:27.030 --> 03:31.030]  I've got a Patreon account. Let me explain Patreon really quickly.
[03:31.030 --> 03:37.030]  Patreon is a website where people can go and they can sign up to financially contribute to the podcast.
[03:37.030 --> 03:46.030]  You sign up, you put in your credit card info, and once a month, it will pay me the amount that you have decided to give me or donate to me or contribute to me.
[03:46.030 --> 03:53.030]  Yesterday, I got an email. Somebody has decided that every month, they are going to contribute $10 to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:54.030 --> 03:58.030]  One person is throwing down $10 every month. That is awesome. Huge shout out to that person.
[03:58.030 --> 04:01.030]  I don't know if you want your name said on the show, so I'm not going to call you out.
[04:01.030 --> 04:05.030]  If you'd like your name said on the show, let me know. I will certainly say it for you because I appreciate that.
[04:05.030 --> 04:09.030]  Huge shout out to everybody that has thrown down a Patreon contribution.
[04:09.030 --> 04:14.030]  Those roll through on the first of the month. I get them around the third into my PayPal account.
[04:14.030 --> 04:17.030]  I truly appreciate that. You guys, I'm not trying to get rich off the podcast.
[04:17.030 --> 04:22.030]  Like I've said many times, I'm using the Patreon contributions to cover the cost of my website.
[04:22.030 --> 04:29.030]  It will also replace some recording equipment. My SD card from my Zoom H6 took a shit, so I will use the funds to replace that.
[04:29.030 --> 04:34.030]  We can do more podcasts on the road. I buy these little microphone covers. I'm going to rub it.
[04:34.030 --> 04:39.030]  This little foam microphone cover here, I buy a lot of those because I try to give a fresh foamy cover.
[04:39.030 --> 04:44.030]  When the guests come over, I try to have a fresh foam cover on there because people cough into it.
[04:44.030 --> 04:48.030]  People rub their faces on it on accident because they forget the mic is there and they bump into it like that.
[04:48.030 --> 04:51.030]  I spend the money on these little foam covers and stuff like that.
[04:51.030 --> 04:55.030]  Eventually, I'm going to need a new MacBook. I feel this one is starting to slow down and glitch out.
[04:55.030 --> 04:57.030]  That's where that funding will go, you guys.
[04:57.030 --> 05:00.030]  Huge thank you to those people that contributed to Patreon. I truly appreciate it.
[05:00.030 --> 05:05.030]  The person that just threw down $10 per month, that is super amazing. Thank you.
[05:05.030 --> 05:11.030]  If you want more information on Patreon, go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[05:11.030 --> 05:14.030]  All the information you want is right there on the screen.
[05:14.030 --> 05:21.030]  All right, you guys. Let's get down to the â€“ music won't turn down. Mixer is down. There we go.
[05:21.030 --> 05:23.030]  Let's get down to business, you guys.
[05:23.030 --> 05:26.030]  Today, we are going to talk about proper mixing and watering technique.
[05:26.030 --> 05:30.030]  Somebody was asking me questions about mixing their nutrients and mixing their water.
[05:30.030 --> 05:33.030]  Then I got a tweet about mixing nutrients and mixing water.
[05:33.030 --> 05:36.030]  I thought this would be a great episode to do.
[05:36.030 --> 05:39.030]  I also have a friend starting a brand new hydro setup.
[05:39.030 --> 05:45.030]  I needed some advice. Since I was going to talk about it, I figured let's put a microphone in front of my face and do it properly.
[05:45.030 --> 05:49.030]  Today's podcast is going to be about properly mixing your nutrients.
[05:49.030 --> 05:54.030]  Then we're going to talk a little bit about properly watering your plants.
[05:54.030 --> 06:00.030]  All right, you guys. Before I get too far into this, I want to say that this advice should work for small gardens, large gardens.
[06:00.030 --> 06:03.030]  This should work for soilless and soil gardens.
[06:03.030 --> 06:06.030]  This also should work for hydro gardens.
[06:06.030 --> 06:12.030]  There will be some adjusting to be done for different applications, but most of this will apply to most gardens.
[06:12.030 --> 06:18.030]  If you're running a TLO or a no-till or a living soil, this probably won't work for you.
[06:18.030 --> 06:22.030]  For you no-till and TLO guys, we'll get Frosty Organics back.
[06:22.030 --> 06:25.030]  We'll get Barefoot back, and we'll do another show about that organic stuff.
[06:25.030 --> 06:29.030]  For now, we're going to talk about mixing with bottles and such.
[06:29.030 --> 06:33.030]  My first point will be clean water. Good water is very important.
[06:33.030 --> 06:36.030]  Reverse osmosis water, RO water is ideal.
[06:36.030 --> 06:42.030]  I understand that not everybody can get an RO machine and install it in their bathroom or in their kitchen for their home grow.
[06:42.030 --> 06:46.030]  I do get it. If you can't do RO water, tap water is okay.
[06:46.030 --> 06:56.030]  If you're using tap water, I would recommend that you go to either the pet store like the fish tank store or either the hydroponic store and get yourself an aquarium air pump.
[06:56.030 --> 06:59.030]  What this is is a pump that sits outside of the water.
[06:59.030 --> 07:01.030]  It does not go in the water. Don't put it in the water. It will kill it.
[07:01.030 --> 07:03.030]  You might electrocute yourself. It'll be bad. Don't do that.
[07:03.030 --> 07:08.030]  It's a pump that goes outside of the water, and it's got a line that runs to an air stone.
[07:08.030 --> 07:11.030]  You'll need to buy some clear lines, some flex hose, or some clear line.
[07:11.030 --> 07:14.030]  They'll have the right size line sitting right next to the pump. Don't worry.
[07:14.030 --> 07:18.030]  Then you'll need air stones to put in the bottom of your reservoir.
[07:18.030 --> 07:22.030]  You'll fill up your container. You put the aquarium air pump next to it.
[07:22.030 --> 07:27.030]  It's a good idea to have the aquarium air pump higher than your water because if the power does go out,
[07:27.030 --> 07:31.030]  you don't want water siphoning down the line and coming out at the other end.
[07:31.030 --> 07:34.030]  That has happened before. Keep the pump higher than the water.
[07:34.030 --> 07:39.030]  Get it on a shelf. Don't put it on the ground because it can work as a siphon if the power goes out.
[07:39.030 --> 07:42.030]  You've got your filled container. You've got your aquarium air pump.
[07:42.030 --> 07:46.030]  You've got your plastic line going to some air stones.
[07:46.030 --> 07:50.030]  Those air stones go in the bottom of that container that's filled with water.
[07:50.030 --> 07:52.030]  You plug it in, and it simply bubbles.
[07:52.030 --> 07:54.030]  I turn it up all the way. It might get loud. It'll just be like,
[07:55.030 --> 08:00.030]  Just turn it up. It'll bubble, and it'll bubble, bubble, bubble that chlorine out of your water.
[08:00.030 --> 08:04.030]  Hopefully, within 24 to 48 hours, you'll get rid of most of that chlorine.
[08:04.030 --> 08:09.030]  Now, there are some things that can only be taken out by reverse osmosis.
[08:09.030 --> 08:17.030]  Honestly, if you are running a home grow and your grow is not large enough to where you've got extra money to invest in an RO machine,
[08:17.030 --> 08:22.030]  you're probably going to be okay using tap water. It's not that major of a deal.
[08:22.030 --> 08:29.030]  One thing I should mention is if you're using tap water, you can use less CalMag than if you're using reverse osmosis water.
[08:29.030 --> 08:33.030]  The tap water already has plenty of calcium in it, so you can reduce that.
[08:33.030 --> 08:37.030]  If you're using RO, you need to use the recommended amount or pretty close to it.
[08:37.030 --> 08:39.030]  That's the major difference.
[08:39.030 --> 08:44.030]  You should be okay if you can't use reverse osmosis water is what I'm getting at.
[08:44.030 --> 08:47.030]  All right. Now, let's talk about the temperature of your water.
[08:47.030 --> 08:54.030]  It's very important that when you're mixing your nutrients, you have your water between 65 and 75 degrees.
[08:54.030 --> 08:56.030]  That's best for your pH and for your nutrients.
[08:56.030 --> 09:02.030]  If you're going hydro, I can say that if you go anywhere above 70, you do encourage algae growth.
[09:02.030 --> 09:06.030]  If you're going hydro, try to keep your water around 70 degrees.
[09:06.030 --> 09:11.030]  If you're going soil, soilless mix, 65 to 75 works.
[09:11.030 --> 09:15.030]  70 is about ideal. 65 is a little low. I would never go lower than 65.
[09:16.030 --> 09:22.030]  If you water your plants with water that's cooler than 65, they will start to make this claw-like shape in the leaves,
[09:22.030 --> 09:24.030]  and they will stop growing.
[09:24.030 --> 09:27.030]  They basically freeze. They chill out. They don't do shit.
[09:27.030 --> 09:31.030]  You don't like sticking your feet or your hands in cold water, so don't do that to your plants.
[09:31.030 --> 09:33.030]  That's my recommendation.
[09:33.030 --> 09:39.030]  If the water is coming out of your spigot or your spout, wherever your water is coming from,
[09:39.030 --> 09:43.030]  if the source is too warm or too cold, for example,
[09:43.030 --> 09:46.030]  right now in Colorado it has been ridiculously cold.
[09:46.030 --> 09:50.030]  It was 17 degrees the other day when I went to work at 7 in the morning.
[09:50.030 --> 09:56.030]  We filled the containers with water from the RO machine, and that water was 62 degrees.
[09:56.030 --> 10:02.030]  There was no chance I was going to feed that water to the plants, so we use bucket heaters to heat the water.
[10:02.030 --> 10:04.030]  If it's too cold, you can use chillers.
[10:04.030 --> 10:09.030]  If you're not looking to invest money in items to keep your water at the right temperature,
[10:09.030 --> 10:12.030]  you can use the lights in your grow room.
[10:12.030 --> 10:19.030]  If you are filling your reservoir and putting your bubblers in there, you can move that to the grow room.
[10:19.030 --> 10:26.030]  You may deal with a little bit more humidity, but the grow lights in that grow room will get your water to the correct temperature.
[10:26.030 --> 10:30.030]  It may take a little while, but that will get it to the right temperature.
[10:30.030 --> 10:33.030]  This may also have the opposite effect.
[10:33.030 --> 10:37.030]  If you're running a hydro grow and you've got the hydro reservoir in the room,
[10:37.030 --> 10:41.030]  perhaps you're running a flood and drain table and the reservoir is underneath the table.
[10:41.030 --> 10:45.030]  Maybe the room is heating up the water too much, and that's when you're going to need a chiller.
[10:45.030 --> 10:48.030]  I actually realized that I said something wrong a couple of minutes ago.
[10:48.030 --> 10:55.030]  If your water is too cold, you need a bucket heater, and if your water is too warm, that's when you need a chiller.
[10:55.030 --> 10:57.030]  I realized as I was saying it that I said that backwards.
[10:57.030 --> 11:02.030]  We have covered the basics of getting your water to the appropriate temperature.
[11:02.030 --> 11:07.030]  Now, it's time to talk about measuring and mixing your nutrients into your water.
[11:07.030 --> 11:11.030]  The first thing you need for this is a clean and accurate measuring device.
[11:11.030 --> 11:13.030]  Maybe you have some measuring cups.
[11:13.030 --> 11:17.030]  I like the shot glass and the beer glass looking style cups.
[11:17.030 --> 11:19.030]  They're really easy to clean.
[11:19.030 --> 11:21.030]  The downfall with them is they are glass.
[11:21.030 --> 11:24.030]  If you're clumsy like me, it may be better for you to get the plastic style.
[11:24.030 --> 11:26.030]  There are a lot of options.
[11:26.030 --> 11:30.030]  Get something with milliliters, with tablespoons and teaspoons, with ounces,
[11:30.030 --> 11:33.030]  because each brand of nutrients is going to ask for different stuff.
[11:33.030 --> 11:36.030]  I like brands that go by milliliters.
[11:36.030 --> 11:40.030]  Milliliters per gallon is my favorite, but each brand does their own thing.
[11:40.030 --> 11:43.030]  You'll need a measuring cup or a measuring device.
[11:43.030 --> 11:48.030]  If you're using dry nutrients like veg bloom, you may need a scale.
[11:48.030 --> 11:56.030]  I recommend that you have a pH meter, a PPM meter, and possibly an EC meter and a thermometer.
[11:56.030 --> 12:00.030]  I can highly recommend the Blue Lab Combo Meter.
[12:00.030 --> 12:02.030]  It's got all of the above on there.
[12:02.030 --> 12:06.030]  The PPM, the EC, the pH, and a thermometer all in one unit.
[12:06.030 --> 12:09.030]  I really love the device. It's a little expensive.
[12:09.030 --> 12:14.030]  One thing that I can recommend, with any pH meter, keep the probe wet.
[12:14.030 --> 12:21.030]  Seal it up somehow with some pH 7 solution in there and keep that probe wet as long as you can,
[12:21.030 --> 12:23.030]  because that will keep it alive.
[12:23.030 --> 12:27.030]  They say about pH probes, if it dries, it dies, so keep that fucker wet.
[12:27.030 --> 12:31.030]  Also, calibrate your equipment frequently, at least once a month.
[12:31.030 --> 12:35.030]  If you're working with it a lot, do it once a week, but at least once a month.
[12:35.030 --> 12:40.030]  At the big grow, if I'm working in a big grow, you guys, you know I bounce around from large grow to large grow.
[12:40.030 --> 12:47.030]  If it's up to me, when I'm using those pH meters, about once every two weeks, I catch myself just going to some solution.
[12:47.030 --> 12:50.030]  You dump the pH solution into a container.
[12:50.030 --> 12:54.030]  There's one that's four and one that's probably seven or ten, and just check them and see.
[12:54.030 --> 12:58.030]  If they don't come out perfectly accurate, take a minute and fix the pH meter.
[12:58.030 --> 13:03.030]  It can't take that long, maybe five, maybe ten minutes at the absolute most if it's frustrating and giving you a hard time.
[13:03.030 --> 13:07.030]  It'll get quicker, so just adjust the calibration on your pH meter.
[13:07.030 --> 13:08.030]  That's super important.
[13:08.030 --> 13:10.030]  Sorry, I went off on a rant there.
[13:10.030 --> 13:16.030]  You're going to need a bucket or a reservoir with a clearly marked measurement area,
[13:16.030 --> 13:21.030]  either like a reservoir from the hydro shop that is already a predetermined volume,
[13:22.030 --> 13:29.030]  or what I like to use is the, I think they're 32 and 55 gallon Rubbermaid trash cans.
[13:29.030 --> 13:36.030]  I buy the trash can at Lowe's, and I also get the little wheels that go underneath it so that you can roll that sucker around.
[13:36.030 --> 13:43.030]  Then I will get a five gallon bucket or one of those five gallon, like the Deep Rock water bottles or whatever brand water bottle,
[13:43.030 --> 13:45.030]  the five gallon kind that gets delivered.
[13:45.030 --> 13:50.030]  I'll go buy one of those, and I will use it to measure out five gallons,
[13:50.030 --> 13:53.030]  and I'll mark it on the inside and the outside of my trash can.
[13:53.030 --> 13:57.030]  Then I'll measure to ten gallons and mark it on the inside and outside of my trash can.
[13:57.030 --> 14:03.030]  Then I'll do 15, and I'll do it in increments of five all the way up to 25 or 30 or 50 or however big my container is,
[14:03.030 --> 14:09.030]  so that way I can see five, ten, fifteen, or however many gallons I've got, and I can be accurate.
[14:09.030 --> 14:10.030]  That's important to me.
[14:10.030 --> 14:15.030]  You need a clean, marked container that you can put water in.
[14:15.030 --> 14:16.030]  It may need to be movable.
[14:16.030 --> 14:20.030]  You may need to get it from your water to your grow, so think about wheels.
[14:20.030 --> 14:22.030]  Think about how you're going to carry it.
[14:22.030 --> 14:25.030]  Most of you guys are probably just going to be mixing in a five gallon bucket.
[14:25.030 --> 14:28.030]  I like the Lowe's bucket, the Home Depot bucket.
[14:28.030 --> 14:29.030]  Keep it simple.
[14:29.030 --> 14:30.030]  Keep it affordable.
[14:30.030 --> 14:34.030]  If you want to buy one of those fancy reservoirs from the grow store, go for it.
[14:34.030 --> 14:35.030]  Be my guest.
[14:35.030 --> 14:36.030]  It looks great.
[14:36.030 --> 14:40.030]  It looks great in pictures, and it's already marked for the volume.
[14:40.030 --> 14:46.030]  Just keep in mind, as soon as you pull up to the house and carry that thing in the house, everybody knows you grow weed now.
[14:46.030 --> 14:48.030]  All right, so you've got a chosen reservoir, a chosen container.
[14:48.030 --> 14:52.030]  One thing I should mention is that you need to clean this occasionally.
[14:52.030 --> 14:54.030]  I would clean it probably every use if you can.
[14:54.030 --> 14:57.030]  If it's a big trash can, I understand that's kind of a pain in the ass.
[14:57.030 --> 15:01.030]  If you don't have a place to rinse it out and hose it out, try to get to it as frequently as you can.
[15:01.030 --> 15:03.030]  You'll see some biofilm buildup on it.
[15:03.030 --> 15:04.030]  It'll get funky.
[15:04.030 --> 15:07.030]  That will start to mess with your EC, your PPM, and your pH.
[15:07.030 --> 15:08.030]  Clean your shit.
[15:08.030 --> 15:11.030]  It only takes a few extra minutes to just clean stuff up.
[15:11.030 --> 15:14.030]  If it's a trash can, you could probably sneak it out to the backyard and hose it out.
[15:14.030 --> 15:16.030]  People won't wonder too much what's going on.
[15:16.030 --> 15:21.030]  If you've got that reservoir from the hydro store, everyone's like, oh, he's cleaning his weed reservoir.
[15:21.030 --> 15:24.030]  So that's when you might want to think about what you're going to buy.
[15:24.030 --> 15:26.030]  Hosing out a five-gallon bucket is really easy.
[15:26.030 --> 15:27.030]  You can do that in the bathtub.
[15:27.030 --> 15:28.030]  You can do that in the shower.
[15:28.030 --> 15:30.030]  So just think about cleaning your container.
[15:30.030 --> 15:31.030]  Do that frequently, please.
[15:31.030 --> 15:33.030]  Clean everything very frequently.
[15:33.030 --> 15:35.030]  All right, so you've got a clean container.
[15:35.030 --> 15:37.030]  Now the next step is to fill it up.
[15:37.030 --> 15:40.030]  You're either using your RO water or your tap water.
[15:40.030 --> 15:41.030]  Fill your container.
[15:41.030 --> 15:46.030]  Fill it up to, if you need 15 gallons, if you need 20 gallons, fill it to where you need it to that gallon amount.
[15:46.030 --> 15:49.030]  If you're using a five-gallon bucket, fill it up to the five-gallon point.
[15:49.030 --> 15:52.030]  In a five-gallon bucket, there will be some extra space.
[15:52.030 --> 15:54.030]  You will not fill it all the way to the top.
[15:54.030 --> 16:00.030]  There's probably like an inch or two of extra space in there, maybe three inches of extra space.
[16:00.030 --> 16:02.030]  Don't fill it all the way to the top.
[16:02.030 --> 16:06.030]  If you're making a reservoir, try to have a little extra room in your reservoir as well.
[16:06.030 --> 16:09.030]  We're going to talk about why here in just a couple of seconds.
[16:09.030 --> 16:12.030]  So you fill up your container and you check the temperature.
[16:12.030 --> 16:15.030]  The first thing I would do is check the temperature.
[16:15.030 --> 16:24.030]  If the temperature is too high or too low, we're going to use the proper tool, either the bucket heater or maybe an aquarium heater or a chiller,
[16:24.030 --> 16:28.030]  or we're going to use the heat from the grow room, or we're going to use whatever.
[16:28.030 --> 16:32.030]  However you got to do it, get that water to the appropriate temperature.
[16:32.030 --> 16:39.030]  If you're using tap water, you may have wanted to fill this up 24 to 48 hours in advance so that you can start bubbling it,
[16:39.030 --> 16:43.030]  and then you can also get your temperature correction device in there at that time,
[16:43.030 --> 16:47.030]  so that when it comes time to mix the nutrients, you're already at the right temperature.
[16:47.030 --> 16:51.030]  So if you're running a commercial grow, before you leave tonight, fill up your containers with water,
[16:51.030 --> 16:55.030]  put your chillers or your bucket heaters in there, and let them run for a little while.
[16:55.030 --> 17:00.030]  Set them on a timer maybe to click on three hours before you come in in the morning, and that shit might start getting right.
[17:00.030 --> 17:02.030]  It'll be correct by the time you get there.
[17:02.030 --> 17:03.030]  Think ahead, you guys.
[17:03.030 --> 17:05.030]  Thinking ahead and growing is very important.
[17:05.030 --> 17:07.030]  So fill your container.
[17:07.030 --> 17:09.030]  Get the temperature of that water correct.
[17:09.030 --> 17:11.030]  Now it's time to mix up your nutrients.
[17:11.030 --> 17:16.030]  Now it's when you need that clean mixing container, that clean measuring device.
[17:16.030 --> 17:20.030]  So when you're mixing, be accurate, you guys.
[17:20.030 --> 17:22.030]  If the bottle says, okay, this is a side rant.
[17:23.030 --> 17:29.030]  If the bottle says 50 mils per gallon, you can probably get away with 25 to 30 mils per gallon.
[17:29.030 --> 17:33.030]  But whatever you decide to mix, be accurate.
[17:33.030 --> 17:39.030]  If you wrote down that your mix is 30 milliliters, put 30 milliliters in that bucket.
[17:39.030 --> 17:41.030]  Don't do 29, don't do 32.
[17:41.030 --> 17:45.030]  Be as accurate as you can, and your plants will love you.
[17:45.030 --> 17:46.030]  You will like it.
[17:46.030 --> 17:47.030]  You'll be able to take better notes.
[17:47.030 --> 17:49.030]  You'll be able to correct things in the future if you see problems.
[17:50.030 --> 17:55.030]  So when you're mixing your nutrients, be as accurate as you possibly can.
[17:55.030 --> 18:02.030]  Also, never mix your bottled nutrients together without mixing them into a large container of water.
[18:02.030 --> 18:05.030]  Those nutrients are in separate bottles for a reason.
[18:05.030 --> 18:07.030]  It's not just because they want to sell you two bottles.
[18:07.030 --> 18:12.030]  There are elements in each bottle that if they were sold together would bind,
[18:12.030 --> 18:16.030]  and it would deactivate basically the ingredients that are in each bottle.
[18:16.030 --> 18:21.030]  They keep them separate, and when you pour bottle A into this much water,
[18:21.030 --> 18:25.030]  it dilutes it strong enough to where when you pour bottle B into that much water,
[18:25.030 --> 18:29.030]  it will not create a chemical bond, and it will not disrupt your solution.
[18:29.030 --> 18:35.030]  So never mix your nutrients together without plenty of water in the container.
[18:35.030 --> 18:41.030]  Now let's move into actually doing the mix, the actual mix of the nutrients, making the soup.
[18:41.030 --> 18:45.030]  Something I should talk about is wear gloves.
[18:45.030 --> 18:48.030]  Put on some nitrile gloves, some rubber gloves, some hand protection.
[18:48.030 --> 18:52.030]  Some of the things you're going to be touching, pH down is bad for your skin.
[18:52.030 --> 18:54.030]  My skin reacts funky to cow mag.
[18:54.030 --> 18:58.030]  From some brands of cow mag, my skin will get splotchy if I touch it.
[18:58.030 --> 19:01.030]  A lot of the things that we play with in the grow are not really good for our skin,
[19:01.030 --> 19:06.030]  so I recommend that when you walk into the grow, you're just wearing rubber gloves all the time.
[19:06.030 --> 19:07.030]  Have some gloves.
[19:07.030 --> 19:08.030]  The black nitriles are my favorite.
[19:08.030 --> 19:10.030]  They fit the best of the shape, the best shape.
[19:10.030 --> 19:12.030]  They don't make my hands smell super funky.
[19:12.030 --> 19:13.030]  That's what I would recommend.
[19:13.030 --> 19:14.030]  So wear gloves.
[19:14.030 --> 19:19.030]  Also, when you're mixing nutrients, you guys, wear eye protection.
[19:19.030 --> 19:20.030]  You might feel nerdy.
[19:20.030 --> 19:21.030]  Who cares?
[19:21.030 --> 19:22.030]  You're not in there to be stylish.
[19:22.030 --> 19:24.030]  Nobody's looking at you.
[19:24.030 --> 19:26.030]  Wear some sort of protective eyewear.
[19:26.030 --> 19:29.030]  If it's those goggles, the Science Lab goggles, that's probably what I would recommend
[19:29.030 --> 19:34.030]  because I have heard a story of a friend who actually listens to this podcast.
[19:35.030 --> 19:41.030]  He was mixing nutrients in his private grow, and he splashed maybe one drop of pH down in his eye,
[19:41.030 --> 19:47.030]  and he had to pull his phone out of his pocket, and he had to use Siri to call 911 for himself
[19:47.030 --> 19:48.030]  because he could not see.
[19:48.030 --> 19:53.030]  He went into full panic mode because it hurt so bad, and he had to call the police
[19:53.030 --> 19:58.030]  and the paramedics to come to his grow to rescue him because he got products in his eye.
[19:58.030 --> 20:00.030]  So, you guys, wear eye protection.
[20:00.030 --> 20:01.030]  You only get one set of eyes.
[20:01.030 --> 20:03.030]  You don't want to fuck them up.
[20:03.030 --> 20:07.030]  Be very careful in the grow, please, with your eyes, with your fingers, with your hands.
[20:07.030 --> 20:09.030]  We're going to talk about grow room safety in another episode.
[20:09.030 --> 20:10.030]  That's a really good idea.
[20:10.030 --> 20:12.030]  So, put on some nitrile gloves.
[20:12.030 --> 20:18.030]  Put on some eye protection, and then grab your clean and trusty measuring device,
[20:18.030 --> 20:20.030]  and we're going to talk about actually mixing nutrients.
[20:20.030 --> 20:24.030]  Now, I asked our Facebook friends and my Instagram friends for guidance on this,
[20:24.030 --> 20:29.030]  and nine out of 10 people said mix your potassium silicates first.
[20:29.030 --> 20:33.030]  So, if you're using some sort of potassium silicate product, if you're using Botanicare,
[20:33.030 --> 20:35.030]  it's just called potassium silicate.
[20:35.030 --> 20:39.030]  If you're using Osa 90, is it Osa 90 or 28?
[20:39.030 --> 20:43.030]  Whichever Osa product you're using, if you're using Osa for potassium silicates,
[20:43.030 --> 20:46.030]  everybody says to put that in first.
[20:46.030 --> 20:48.030]  So, potassium silicates first.
[20:48.030 --> 20:50.030]  Stir that for a few minutes.
[20:50.030 --> 20:52.030]  Get it emulsified.
[20:52.030 --> 20:53.030]  That's the word I'm looking for.
[20:53.030 --> 20:55.030]  Get it fully emulsified into your water.
[20:55.030 --> 20:57.030]  If you can see it in there, you need to stir longer.
[20:57.030 --> 21:02.030]  After the potassium silicates, everybody recommends that you add CalMag.
[21:02.030 --> 21:05.030]  Add in the recommended or appropriate amount of CalMag.
[21:05.030 --> 21:11.030]  Stir again, and then after that, if you're using micro, that's when you would add in your micro.
[21:11.030 --> 21:14.030]  If you're not using micro, you might want to read about it.
[21:14.030 --> 21:18.030]  Maybe your nutrient line has something else that is covering the micro.
[21:18.030 --> 21:20.030]  Check and see what you're missing.
[21:20.030 --> 21:24.030]  After that, everybody would recommend that you use your base nutrients.
[21:24.030 --> 21:28.030]  If you're using a brand that only has one bottle of base nutrients,
[21:28.030 --> 21:30.030]  add in your base nutrients at the appropriate amount.
[21:30.030 --> 21:34.030]  If you're using something like Advanced Nutrients that has an A and a B,
[21:34.030 --> 21:40.030]  you would definitely do A first, give it a little stir, then put in B and give it a little stir.
[21:40.030 --> 21:42.030]  Again, this is all about chemical bonds.
[21:42.030 --> 21:47.030]  We're doing things in this order so that things do not bond in specific ways.
[21:47.030 --> 21:52.030]  So, mix in your potassium silicate, your CalMag, your micro, your base,
[21:52.030 --> 21:54.030]  your A and B if you have a two-part.
[21:54.030 --> 21:58.030]  And that was when you would add in any other additives that you've got.
[21:58.030 --> 22:03.030]  If you're adding a bloom booster, if you're adding any sweeteners or bud hardeners,
[22:03.030 --> 22:05.030]  those would all get mixed in last.
[22:05.030 --> 22:09.030]  Now, something that somebody recommended to me, and I checked on this and it makes sense,
[22:09.030 --> 22:12.030]  stir counterclockwise.
[22:12.030 --> 22:17.030]  Again, this is all about bonding of certain molecules.
[22:17.030 --> 22:20.030]  I know it sounds crazy, you guys, but do research on that if you'd like to.
[22:20.030 --> 22:26.030]  Stirring your solution counterclockwise will have a difference in bonding of molecules in your solution.
[22:26.030 --> 22:28.030]  If you're interested, read about that.
[22:28.030 --> 22:29.030]  It's very interesting.
[22:29.030 --> 22:34.030]  All right, so we've got all of our products stirred into our water.
[22:34.030 --> 22:36.030]  It has all been stirred counterclockwise.
[22:36.030 --> 22:38.030]  It's all at the appropriate temperature.
[22:38.030 --> 22:41.030]  It's hanging out for a couple of seconds, getting all mixed in together.
[22:41.030 --> 22:43.030]  Now it's time to check the PPMs.
[22:43.030 --> 22:46.030]  Why do we want to check the PPMs?
[22:46.030 --> 22:50.030]  The particles per million tells us how much stuff is in our water.
[22:50.030 --> 22:54.030]  If you feed your plants too much stuff, they're going to choke.
[22:54.030 --> 22:55.030]  They're going to get nutrient lockout.
[22:55.030 --> 22:56.030]  They're going to get burnt.
[22:56.030 --> 22:58.030]  They're going to look funky.
[22:58.030 --> 23:01.030]  We want to make sure that there's not too much stuff in there, not too many particles,
[23:01.030 --> 23:04.030]  not too many nutrients, not too many elements.
[23:04.030 --> 23:07.030]  How many PPMs do we want to get our water to?
[23:07.030 --> 23:13.030]  That kind of depends on what phase of growth or bloom you are in.
[23:13.030 --> 23:15.030]  Seedlings and small plants don't need a lot of nutrients.
[23:15.030 --> 23:17.030]  They don't need a lot of PPMs.
[23:17.030 --> 23:20.030]  I try to start off at a lower PPM for my smaller plants,
[23:20.030 --> 23:25.030]  somewhere around 600 to 900 PPMs for the small stuff,
[23:25.030 --> 23:28.030]  like the small veg plants in cups and small pots.
[23:28.030 --> 23:30.030]  As they get bigger, I do increase.
[23:30.030 --> 23:34.030]  By week four, I'm usually up to about 1,500 PPMs.
[23:34.030 --> 23:37.030]  In veg, I don't really go too hard with the nutrients.
[23:37.030 --> 23:40.030]  I give them base nutrients, potassium silicates, cow mag.
[23:40.030 --> 23:43.030]  I'll give them some stuff to keep them moving root-wise,
[23:43.030 --> 23:47.030]  but they really don't get a whole lot of nutrients in the veg phase.
[23:47.030 --> 23:49.030]  I just want them to grow. I want them to get stout.
[23:49.030 --> 23:51.030]  I want them to be healthy.
[23:51.030 --> 23:55.030]  Once we start flowering, that's when I start boosting it up.
[23:55.030 --> 24:01.030]  At week one of flowering, I'll probably start off right about maybe 1,000 or 1,300 PPMs.
[24:01.030 --> 24:07.030]  Then I will increase until I hit, honestly, I'll get close to 1,900 PPMs.
[24:07.030 --> 24:11.030]  Honestly, I would not recommend, if you're using bottled nutrients
[24:11.030 --> 24:13.030]  and you're not a very experienced grower,
[24:13.030 --> 24:18.030]  you probably shouldn't get over 1,700 or 1,800 particles per million in your solution,
[24:18.030 --> 24:20.030]  or you'll start burning your plants.
[24:20.030 --> 24:23.030]  If you think you know what you're doing and you can mix and match nutrients
[24:23.030 --> 24:26.030]  to where you're not giving it too much of one thing,
[24:26.030 --> 24:29.030]  but you're supplementing what's missing by adding more PPMs,
[24:29.030 --> 24:31.030]  then you may be able to get away with it.
[24:31.030 --> 24:35.030]  But be very careful, because once you've burnt the plants, you can't take that back.
[24:35.030 --> 24:38.030]  You can give more, but you can't take anything out.
[24:38.030 --> 24:42.030]  Honestly, most of the feed charts that come with bottled nutrients these days,
[24:42.030 --> 24:44.030]  most of them are pretty accurate.
[24:44.030 --> 24:46.030]  If you follow that feed chart, maybe reduce it,
[24:46.030 --> 24:49.030]  maybe use about 75% of what the bottle says.
[24:49.030 --> 24:51.030]  Most of the companies will make a feed chart.
[24:51.030 --> 24:52.030]  You can find it online.
[24:52.030 --> 24:56.030]  Follow that, and it won't get you over 1,700 or 1,800 PPMs.
[24:56.030 --> 24:59.030]  Then see what that chart does and adjust from there.
[24:59.030 --> 25:01.030]  If you want to go a little harder, go for it.
[25:01.030 --> 25:03.030]  If you realize you need to go a little lighter, go for it.
[25:03.030 --> 25:05.030]  That's something that you could do.
[25:05.030 --> 25:06.030]  You've got your solution mixed up.
[25:06.030 --> 25:07.030]  You're checking your PPMs.
[25:07.030 --> 25:11.030]  If you feel like it's right where you want it, now you need to adjust the pH.
[25:11.030 --> 25:16.030]  If you feel like the PPMs are too high, if you feel like it's too hot for your plants,
[25:16.030 --> 25:18.030]  you can simply add water.
[25:18.030 --> 25:22.030]  If you've got everything mixed up and the PPMs are hitting more than you want for that week
[25:22.030 --> 25:25.030]  and you feel like it's too hot for the plants, add a little bit of water.
[25:25.030 --> 25:28.030]  If you're using RO water, put RO water in there.
[25:28.030 --> 25:30.030]  If you're using tap water, add more tap water.
[25:30.030 --> 25:33.030]  Get your PPM meter and put it in your solution that's mixed up,
[25:33.030 --> 25:38.030]  and then get your regular water and just slowly add it and watch the numbers on your PPM meter go down.
[25:38.030 --> 25:42.030]  Then once you get it to the acceptable appropriate number, then you can stop.
[25:42.030 --> 25:44.030]  That's when it's time to adjust your pH.
[25:44.030 --> 25:47.030]  The last thing you do is adjust your pH.
[25:47.030 --> 25:49.030]  Now you need your pH meter.
[25:49.030 --> 25:53.030]  You want to put it in the water, give it a little stir around, give it a couple seconds to adjust,
[25:53.030 --> 25:55.030]  and see where you are.
[25:55.030 --> 25:58.030]  If it's up too high, you need to put some pH down in there.
[25:58.030 --> 26:01.030]  If you're too low, you need to put some pH up in there.
[26:02.030 --> 26:06.030]  A good area for your plants, for most plants to be, is 6.2.
[26:06.030 --> 26:10.030]  pH your solution to 6.2 and you should be just fine.
[26:10.030 --> 26:12.030]  My smaller plants, they go a little lower.
[26:12.030 --> 26:14.030]  My larger plants may get a little higher,
[26:14.030 --> 26:20.030]  but 6.2 is a good general range of pH for most cannabis plants.
[26:20.030 --> 26:22.030]  I did a whole episode about the importance of pH.
[26:22.030 --> 26:25.030]  I recorded that episode on August 10th of 2015.
[26:25.030 --> 26:30.030]  It's actually episode number 88, and it is called The Importance of pH.
[26:30.030 --> 26:34.030]  If you want to check that out, it is still in the feed on iTunes and Stitcher,
[26:34.030 --> 26:37.030]  and it's on the website, iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[26:37.030 --> 26:43.030]  There are 100 episodes available there, so if you want to go back in history, check those out.
[26:43.030 --> 26:45.030]  Again, it's episode number 88.
[26:45.030 --> 26:48.030]  It's called The Importance of pH.
[26:48.030 --> 26:51.030]  All right, you guys, so we've got our reservoir filled.
[26:51.030 --> 26:53.030]  We've got our nutrients mixed in there.
[26:53.030 --> 26:55.030]  We've got our PPMs adjusted to the appropriate PPMs
[26:55.030 --> 26:58.030]  so it won't be too strong of a solution for our plants.
[26:58.030 --> 27:01.030]  We've got our pH adjusted to approximately 6.2
[27:01.030 --> 27:05.030]  or whatever you're finding appropriate for your garden at this stage of its life.
[27:05.030 --> 27:08.030]  Now let's talk about actually physically feeding the plants.
[27:08.030 --> 27:13.030]  If you're running an auto hydro system or a soil or soilless or cocoa system
[27:13.030 --> 27:17.030]  that's on a drip system, make sure that the plants get,
[27:17.030 --> 27:20.030]  that the root zone, that the soil gets fully saturated
[27:20.030 --> 27:23.030]  when you water those plants with your automation system.
[27:23.030 --> 27:25.030]  You have to figure out how long it comes on
[27:26.030 --> 27:28.030]  and how frequently that watering system comes on.
[27:28.030 --> 27:31.030]  I'm going to do an entire episode about building a watering system
[27:31.030 --> 27:35.030]  and getting that set up, so that will be probably two or three episodes from now.
[27:35.030 --> 27:39.030]  I may put that one out as a Thursday bonus episode.
[27:39.030 --> 27:45.030]  So if you're running an automated system, mainly focus on getting everything saturated,
[27:45.030 --> 27:48.030]  let it dry kind of, and then saturate it again.
[27:48.030 --> 27:50.030]  You need a timer.
[27:50.030 --> 27:53.030]  You'll have to run the timer and see how long it takes to saturate the plants,
[27:53.030 --> 27:56.030]  and then you'll have to pay attention to how long it takes them to dry,
[27:56.030 --> 27:58.030]  and then you'll have to make that timer run again.
[27:58.030 --> 28:01.030]  So it's duration and interval is what you're going to have to figure out.
[28:01.030 --> 28:04.030]  It's not too hard. It just takes a day to do it.
[28:04.030 --> 28:06.030]  That's pretty much how you're going to have to set up any drip system
[28:06.030 --> 28:11.030]  with any sort of hydro or cocoa or soilless mix.
[28:11.030 --> 28:13.030]  Just make sure that if you're using cubes or whatever you're using,
[28:13.030 --> 28:17.030]  make sure that they get fully saturated and that they've got the appropriate dry time,
[28:17.030 --> 28:20.030]  and then just repeat that cycle over and over.
[28:20.030 --> 28:22.030]  As the plants get larger and further into the flower phase,
[28:22.030 --> 28:26.030]  you may have to increase either the duration of watering
[28:26.030 --> 28:30.030]  or the less interval between waterings is something you'll have to think about,
[28:30.030 --> 28:32.030]  but you'll see that happening as it grows,
[28:32.030 --> 28:35.030]  and we're going to talk more about that in that auto watering episode that's coming up.
[28:35.030 --> 28:43.030]  So let's talk about watering your soil or cocoa or soilless mix plants that are in pots.
[28:43.030 --> 28:45.030]  Maybe you're watering with a pitcher.
[28:45.030 --> 28:48.030]  Maybe you're going to the reservoir and just getting a pitcher.
[28:48.030 --> 28:51.030]  In my personal grow, I use a Kool-Aid pitcher.
[28:51.030 --> 28:53.030]  I use a one-gallon plastic pitcher.
[28:53.030 --> 28:56.030]  I use two of them so that I can scoop water with both hands.
[28:56.030 --> 29:00.030]  My plants are in seven-gallon pots, so they're not too low.
[29:00.030 --> 29:03.030]  I can reach them just by kind of doing a short bend.
[29:03.030 --> 29:06.030]  I can walk down the middle of the row and water two plants at a time.
[29:06.030 --> 29:09.030]  I scoop water out of the res, turn a little bit, water two plants.
[29:09.030 --> 29:11.030]  So I use the Kool-Aid pitcher.
[29:11.030 --> 29:14.030]  At the commercial grow, I use a water wand.
[29:14.030 --> 29:17.030]  I put a pump in a trash can, which is the reservoir.
[29:17.030 --> 29:19.030]  The trash can's on wheels.
[29:19.030 --> 29:22.030]  I put a pump that's like a sump pump that plugs into the wall.
[29:22.030 --> 29:25.030]  That runs to a hose, which runs to a water wand.
[29:25.030 --> 29:28.030]  That water wand, I basically squeeze the trigger and the water comes out.
[29:28.030 --> 29:33.030]  It's got about a two-foot attachment extension on it so that I can get to the plants that are at the end of the rows.
[29:33.030 --> 29:35.030]  That's why I like the water wand for the commercial grow.
[29:35.030 --> 29:38.030]  So I either use the pitcher or a water wand.
[29:38.030 --> 29:40.030]  However you want to do it is fine.
[29:40.030 --> 29:42.030]  The water wand, you tend to make a little bit of a mess.
[29:42.030 --> 29:45.030]  With the pitcher, you can kind of put the water where you want it.
[29:45.030 --> 29:50.030]  I feel like the pitcher is more time efficient because I can grab water and pour it.
[29:50.030 --> 29:51.030]  Grab water and pour it.
[29:51.030 --> 29:53.030]  There's no time for it to come out.
[29:53.030 --> 29:54.030]  It just pours out of the pitcher.
[29:54.030 --> 30:00.030]  With the water wand, with the five-gallon pot at the commercial grow, I count to 70 as I water.
[30:00.030 --> 30:03.030]  I count one, two, three, four, five.
[30:03.030 --> 30:07.030]  It takes me to 70 to water a five-gallon pot appropriately.
[30:07.030 --> 30:10.030]  That's probably 50 seconds of me counting to 70.
[30:10.030 --> 30:12.030]  That's how fast I just probably over-count time.
[30:12.030 --> 30:14.030]  But that's a lot of time.
[30:14.030 --> 30:16.030]  I prefer the pitcher method.
[30:16.030 --> 30:18.030]  Any way you do it, soak the plant.
[30:18.030 --> 30:22.030]  When you're watering the plants, make sure you fully saturate that root zone.
[30:22.030 --> 30:25.030]  All that soil needs to get wet.
[30:25.030 --> 30:26.030]  You want to see some runoff.
[30:26.030 --> 30:28.030]  You want at least a little bit of runoff.
[30:28.030 --> 30:34.030]  If you've got catch trays underneath your plants, if they're in the table, you want to see runoff from every single plant.
[30:34.030 --> 30:39.030]  I like to know that every inch of soil inside that pot got saturated with nutrients and water
[30:39.030 --> 30:45.030]  When it does start to dry out and those roots go growing in there, they find those nutrients in that soil.
[30:45.030 --> 30:48.030]  It's like, hey, there's some more stuff for me to eat.
[30:48.030 --> 30:51.030]  It's really good to saturate the whole thing, I think.
[30:51.030 --> 30:58.030]  Make sure you saturate your entire root ball, get a little bit of runoff, and then let them start to dry out over the next few days.
[30:58.030 --> 31:01.030]  I don't water until they get kind of dry.
[31:01.030 --> 31:03.030]  I like to pick them up and see how light they are.
[31:03.030 --> 31:06.030]  Once they start getting light, that's when they need water.
[31:06.030 --> 31:07.030]  You'll know the difference.
[31:07.030 --> 31:09.030]  You'll start learning the difference.
[31:09.030 --> 31:13.030]  I also like to watch for when the leaves start to droop just a little bit.
[31:13.030 --> 31:17.030]  Normally, if you're doing it right, your leaves are facing up just a little bit.
[31:17.030 --> 31:18.030]  They're praying.
[31:18.030 --> 31:21.030]  If you're doing a good job, the leaves are horizontal.
[31:21.030 --> 31:25.030]  When they start getting thirsty, they'll start to curl down and hang and droop just a little bit.
[31:25.030 --> 31:29.030]  As soon as you see that droop is when those plants want water.
[31:29.030 --> 31:32.030]  That is the most ideal time to water those plants.
[31:32.030 --> 31:41.030]  If you can figure out that timing from when you water them to when that droop barely starts and water them right then, every time, your plants will be as happy as they can be.
[31:41.030 --> 31:48.030]  Try to find that timing, that sweet spot of right before they droop and when they get super light, and then water them right then.
[31:48.030 --> 31:50.030]  It will get easier the more you go.
[31:50.030 --> 31:54.030]  The more you grow, the less these things will seem like a challenge to you.
[31:54.030 --> 31:56.030]  You'll walk in the grow room, and you'll be able to see.
[31:56.030 --> 32:00.030]  You'll go, oh, I can tell by looking at the top of the soil that that plant needs water.
[32:00.030 --> 32:01.030]  You'll get good at it.
[32:01.030 --> 32:02.030]  Don't worry.
[32:02.030 --> 32:03.030]  Just keep practicing.
[32:03.030 --> 32:04.030]  Soak the entire plant.
[32:04.030 --> 32:05.030]  Give it some time to dry.
[32:05.030 --> 32:07.030]  Then re-soak it.
[32:07.030 --> 32:10.030]  Then watch the leaves for indicators of issues.
[32:10.030 --> 32:15.030]  If your leaves start doing funny shit, that tells you that there's something wrong with the feeding.
[32:15.030 --> 32:18.030]  Your leaves are going to tell you if the plants were over-watered.
[32:18.030 --> 32:21.030]  If the plants are over-watered, they're going to start making a claw.
[32:21.030 --> 32:24.030]  If it's over-watered or too cold, it will look very similar.
[32:24.030 --> 32:28.030]  The leaves will still be horizontal, and they won't droop, but they will claw up.
[32:29.030 --> 32:33.030]  It will start to look like, just hold your hand out straight and then make a claw like you're a monster.
[32:33.030 --> 32:37.030]  That claw shape, that's what your leaves will start doing if they are over-watered.
[32:37.030 --> 32:40.030]  If they are under-watered, they'll just start drooping.
[32:40.030 --> 32:42.030]  They'll just go limp and start hanging down.
[32:42.030 --> 32:47.030]  If they get severely under-watered, the tops of your plants will just start drooping over, and they'll look dead.
[32:47.030 --> 32:48.030]  You'll be able to see it.
[32:48.030 --> 32:49.030]  It's sad.
[32:49.030 --> 32:50.030]  You'll be scared as shit.
[32:50.030 --> 32:57.030]  If your plants do get to that sort of a dryness, I recommend that you don't water them with full-strength nutrients right away.
[32:57.030 --> 33:05.030]  I would water them with light nutrients just to get them alive and back to life and woken up, and then feed them with nutrients later on.
[33:05.030 --> 33:09.030]  The way I see it is I don't want to get woken up to a big, gigantic meal.
[33:09.030 --> 33:13.030]  I don't want to eat spaghetti and meatballs and garlic bread first thing in the morning.
[33:13.030 --> 33:17.030]  I'd rather have maybe some oatmeal and some OJ to get myself started, maybe some fruit.
[33:17.030 --> 33:19.030]  I feel plants are the same way.
[33:19.030 --> 33:22.030]  When they're that droopy, you just want to hydrate them and get them moving.
[33:22.030 --> 33:24.030]  You don't want to clog them up with more food.
[33:24.030 --> 33:25.030]  I don't know.
[33:25.030 --> 33:29.030]  Maybe some of you guys want to wake up and eat a steak right away, but that is not how I'm going to roll.
[33:29.030 --> 33:32.030]  Okay, so underwater, we talked about that burn.
[33:32.030 --> 33:41.030]  If the plants start looking like they are getting crispy or if they're getting funky on the edges or if they have rust-looking spots on them, you may be giving them too much nutrients.
[33:41.030 --> 33:47.030]  If the edges of your leaves are starting to get crispy and over-sharp, you may be using too much CalMag.
[33:47.030 --> 33:49.030]  Pay attention to the leaves.
[33:49.030 --> 33:55.030]  If you need to reduce your nutrients, you can do that, but that burn is probably not going to go away.
[33:55.030 --> 33:58.030]  Keep an eye on the new growth and make sure that you're not burning the new growth.
[33:58.030 --> 34:00.030]  It is okay if leaves get funky.
[34:00.030 --> 34:03.030]  It is okay to go ahead and remove a leaf.
[34:03.030 --> 34:04.030]  Don't be worried.
[34:04.030 --> 34:07.030]  Just cut it right off or pull it off with your fingers.
[34:07.030 --> 34:09.030]  There are probably more leaves coming to back that one up.
[34:09.030 --> 34:14.030]  One thing I've noticed is when you take off leaves, the plants will just replace it if it needs it.
[34:14.030 --> 34:17.030]  Also, the leaves are going to tell you if you have any sort of deficiency.
[34:17.030 --> 34:27.030]  If your leaves start getting pale yellow, if the plants are going slow and not growing fast enough, you probably are missing some nutrients and you could probably increase your PPMs.
[34:27.030 --> 34:29.030]  Also, that could be a pH issue.
[34:29.030 --> 34:32.030]  You could have a lot of problems if you're showing deficiencies.
[34:32.030 --> 34:35.030]  Quite often, pH issues disguise themselves as deficiencies.
[34:35.030 --> 34:38.030]  I talk a lot about that in episode 88.
[34:38.030 --> 34:40.030]  Pay a lot of attention to the leaves, you guys.
[34:40.030 --> 34:44.030]  Paying attention to the leaves will really help, but also keep notes.
[34:44.030 --> 34:51.030]  If you keep notes of what you mixed into the solution and what you fed, try to write down what you mixed.
[34:51.030 --> 34:55.030]  Try to write down the pH and try to write down the PPMs of every feeding.
[34:55.030 --> 35:03.030]  Write down the date and time and also take notes of anything you saw in the grow room that day so that you can look back and you can have a chart and some history.
[35:03.030 --> 35:09.030]  You can say, oh, look, on this day, my pH was a little high and now this plant is acting funky.
[35:09.030 --> 35:11.030]  Now I know that I need to make the pH lower.
[35:12.030 --> 35:18.030]  That's how I've learned that OG Kush plants, the cushier the plant, the more cow maggot wants.
[35:18.030 --> 35:21.030]  Just stuff like golden goat is always macro deficient.
[35:21.030 --> 35:26.030]  There's just stuff like that that you learn and you can really boost up the macro nutrients with golden goat.
[35:26.030 --> 35:30.030]  It's just stuff you learn from growing specific plants over and over again.
[35:30.030 --> 35:32.030]  Learn from each watering.
[35:32.030 --> 35:33.030]  Learn from your notes.
[35:33.030 --> 35:35.030]  I think that will be beneficial.
[35:35.030 --> 35:36.030]  Take a lot of notes, you guys.
[35:36.030 --> 35:37.030]  I take a lot of notes.
[35:37.030 --> 35:40.030]  That is definitely a huge part of what makes me a better grower.
[35:40.030 --> 35:42.030]  All right.
[35:42.030 --> 35:53.030]  I feel like I have covered the basics and maybe a little bit of more than the basics of mixing your nutrients and properly watering your plants to properly saturate the soil and give them some time to dry out.
[35:53.030 --> 36:00.030]  Now, I posted to Facebook that I was seeking help and guidance for this episode because I wanted to make sure that I didn't miss anything.
[36:01.030 --> 36:06.030]  When I posted to Instagram, I got a couple of replies that I felt I wanted to share with you.
[36:06.030 --> 36:08.030]  The first one comes from Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[36:08.030 --> 36:14.030]  The question that I posted to Instagram basically said, hey, I'm writing a podcast about growing with bottled nutrients.
[36:14.030 --> 36:16.030]  Does anybody have any guidance?
[36:16.030 --> 36:20.030]  The folks at Dragonfly Earth Medicine said, more importantly, what bottled nutrients?
[36:20.030 --> 36:25.030]  Make sure you read ingredients and make sure it is healthy for mind, body, and soil.
[36:25.030 --> 36:31.030]  Let's also remember there are only six companies that sell synthetics and all fertilizer companies are from those six companies.
[36:31.030 --> 36:35.030]  Then they also say that brewing is only expanding your microbiology.
[36:35.030 --> 36:37.030]  If you're brewing synthetics, you're wasting your time.
[36:37.030 --> 36:40.030]  It is counterintuitive to brew synthetics.
[36:40.030 --> 36:44.030]  It is like treating your body herbally and doing a round of antibiotics at the end.
[36:44.030 --> 36:54.030]  The important part here was that we need to pay a little bit of attention to where our products are coming from and what we are putting into the products that we are calling medicine.
[36:54.030 --> 37:00.030]  Pay attention, make sure that what you're using is healthy for your mind, body, and your soil.
[37:00.030 --> 37:02.030]  I also got another message on Instagram.
[37:02.030 --> 37:19.030]  This one says, if you add a form of high-quality fulvic acid to your guys' water before anything else, it helps buffer pH of your solution and provide a natural form of chelation without adding any NPEK or PPMs to your water.
[37:19.030 --> 37:30.030]  It works in any type of setup, super cost efficient, and it helps your plants to naturally and easily uptake the nutrients and minerals you give them, especially the hard ones such as iron.
[37:30.030 --> 37:39.030]  This guy recommends that we add a form of high-quality fulvic acid and he recommends Full Power or Shilajit as the brand he used.
[37:39.030 --> 37:48.030]  He says to add that before adding anything else and it will help buffer your pH and it will help your plants uptake your nutrients better.
[37:48.030 --> 37:49.030]  So that's always helpful.
[37:49.030 --> 37:51.030]  Then here's the part that really got my attention.
[37:51.030 --> 38:08.030]  He said also, we should completely move away from harmful and non-regenerative farming practices such as synthetic fertilizer programs that aren't sustainable and do more harm than good to our gardens, planet, and its limited natural life-sustaining resources of life such as water, land, and clean air.
[38:09.030 --> 38:18.030]  He goes on to say there's nothing wrong with using bottled nutrients or other forms of farming, but we must still be aware of the effects we have on our planet and fellow man through our action or worse yet inaction.
[38:18.030 --> 38:24.030]  He said, I figured I'd touch on that last part, my shameless alternative techniques promoting.
[38:24.030 --> 38:29.030]  That came from a guy who calls himself LOS Gardens on Instagram, LOS underscore gardens.
[38:30.030 --> 38:38.030]  Hey, I appreciate it because we all need to be reminded occasionally to pay attention to where our products are coming from and what we're putting into ourselves and our gardens.
[38:38.030 --> 38:42.030]  I appreciate the insight and I appreciate the help and advice.
[38:42.030 --> 38:46.030]  Hey guys, I understand that not everybody is able to grow organically.
[38:46.030 --> 38:48.030]  Not everybody lives in a farm area.
[38:48.030 --> 38:50.030]  I understand that a lot of us live in cities.
[38:50.030 --> 38:52.030]  A lot of us have our neighbors right next door.
[38:52.030 --> 38:56.030]  I can almost reach out one of my windows and touch my neighbor's house is how close we are.
[38:56.030 --> 39:00.030]  I completely understand that we don't all have space to do organic farming practices.
[39:00.030 --> 39:04.030]  I understand that we can all conceal the odors and the extra ingredients and the extra steps.
[39:04.030 --> 39:06.030]  I understand that I'm not judging you.
[39:06.030 --> 39:09.030]  If you need to use bottled nutrients, let's do it.
[39:09.030 --> 39:11.030]  I use bottled nutrients myself.
[39:11.030 --> 39:13.030]  Let's just think a little bit while we're doing it.
[39:13.030 --> 39:17.030]  Let's not try to support companies that don't support us and companies that don't support the environment.
[39:17.030 --> 39:19.030]  You get to choose where your money goes.
[39:19.030 --> 39:20.030]  So choose wisely.
[39:21.030 --> 39:27.030]  I want to thank everybody who commented and replied on my Facebook and Instagram posts that helped me put this episode together.
[39:27.030 --> 39:29.030]  I truly do appreciate it.
[39:29.030 --> 39:33.030]  I also want to thank everybody that listened to the bonus episode that I put out Thursday.
[39:33.030 --> 39:40.030]  You guys, if you did not listen to the episode that I put out Thursday about seasonal affective disorder, you may want to go give that a listen.
[39:40.030 --> 39:45.030]  Especially if you live in one of the colder winter climates where we're freezing our asses off for the past few weeks.
[39:45.030 --> 39:48.030]  It may be a good episode for you to listen to.
[39:48.030 --> 39:53.030]  Also, I have found two solutions for the folks that have been asking for old podcast episodes.
[39:53.030 --> 39:57.030]  I have got a short-term solution and a long-term solution.
[39:57.030 --> 39:58.030]  They are underway.
[39:58.030 --> 40:01.030]  I am not going to tell you what I'm going to do because they are not there yet.
[40:01.030 --> 40:04.030]  Once they are out, I will tell you all about it.
[40:04.030 --> 40:06.030]  You guys will be able to give it a listen.
[40:06.030 --> 40:10.030]  I truly appreciate how interested everybody is in hearing the old episodes.
[40:10.030 --> 40:12.030]  They really lit a fire under my ass.
[40:12.030 --> 40:14.030]  I will get those episodes out to you.
[40:14.030 --> 40:16.030]  The first 22 are ready.
[40:16.030 --> 40:18.030]  There are 179 episodes.
[40:18.030 --> 40:23.030]  It's going to take me a minute to catch up, but I will get every episode listenable very soon.
[40:23.030 --> 40:25.030]  22 are ready.
[40:25.030 --> 40:27.030]  I will make an announcement where they are very soon.
[40:27.030 --> 40:31.030]  If you're proactive, you may be able to go find them on your own.
[40:31.030 --> 40:33.030]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[40:33.030 --> 40:34.030]  It's been 179 episodes.
[40:34.030 --> 40:37.030]  I truly appreciate everybody for following me this far.
[40:37.030 --> 40:40.030]  I need to give a huge shout-out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.

[49:44.420 --> 49:47.420]  Let them know you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[49:48.420 --> 49:53.420]  You guys, last week I did an episode about mixing your nutrients and properly watering your plants.
[49:53.420 --> 49:58.420]  I may have overlooked a couple of things that I want to throw into this episode.
[49:58.420 --> 50:02.420]  I admit that I am not a very experienced hydro grower.
[50:02.420 --> 50:04.420]  I have not done a lot of hydroponic growing.
[50:04.420 --> 50:10.420]  When you're growing hydro, if you are mixing up a reservoir and you are putting nutrients in there,
[50:10.420 --> 50:14.420]  and you start running that for a few days, some of the water may evaporate.
[50:14.420 --> 50:16.420]  You may need to top that off.
[50:16.420 --> 50:18.420]  I would check daily.
[50:18.420 --> 50:21.420]  Get in there and check to make sure the water has not gone too low.
[50:21.420 --> 50:24.420]  While you're in there checking, check the pH.
[50:24.420 --> 50:26.420]  The pH may need to be adjusted.
[50:26.420 --> 50:30.420]  On a daily basis, go in there and check your hydro tank.
[50:30.420 --> 50:34.420]  If you're using deep water culture, if you're using an ebb and flow, if you're using a drain table,
[50:34.420 --> 50:38.420]  however you're doing it, make sure there's enough water in your reservoir
[50:38.420 --> 50:41.420]  and make sure that the pH hasn't changed too dramatically.
[50:41.420 --> 50:43.420]  If it has, fix it.
[50:44.420 --> 50:46.420]  You may need to add a little water to that.
[50:46.420 --> 50:49.420]  When you add the water, make sure your PPMs are correct.
[50:49.420 --> 50:53.420]  If your PPMs go too low, you may need to add a little bit of nutrients.
[50:53.420 --> 50:57.420]  Be careful when you do this because in hydro it is easy to burn your plants.
[50:57.420 --> 51:02.420]  Something I overlooked that you may need to add water and that when you do that,
[51:02.420 --> 51:05.420]  adjust your pH and also check your PPMs.
[51:05.420 --> 51:08.420]  Something else I need to mention about hydro.
[51:08.420 --> 51:14.420]  It is a good idea to remix your nutrients approximately every 7 to 10 days.
[51:14.420 --> 51:16.420]  Drain that water out of there.
[51:16.420 --> 51:17.420]  Put fresh water in there.
[51:17.420 --> 51:20.420]  If you're using reverse osmosis water, if you're using tap water,
[51:20.420 --> 51:25.420]  whatever kind of water you're using, clean it out, refill it, redo your nutrient program,
[51:25.420 --> 51:30.420]  reset the PPMs, reset the pH, and get everything started for a fresh week.
[51:30.420 --> 51:34.420]  This is actually a really good idea because your plants want a different diet
[51:34.420 --> 51:37.420]  approximately every 7 to 10 days anyway.
[51:37.420 --> 51:40.420]  Through different phases of growth, they're going to require different things.
[51:40.420 --> 51:43.420]  You don't feed your plants the exact same stuff all the way through veg
[51:43.420 --> 51:47.420]  and you definitely don't feed them the same thing all the way through bloom.
[51:47.420 --> 51:51.420]  It's a good idea to change the mix every 7 to 10 days anyway.
[51:51.420 --> 51:55.420]  Every time you're in there doing anything with the water, make sure you check the pH.
[51:55.420 --> 51:58.420]  It's always a good idea. You can't go wrong.
[51:58.420 --> 52:02.420]  I apologize for missing that in the last episode, but here it is for you now.
[52:02.420 --> 52:03.420]  I hope I'm helping you out.
[52:03.420 --> 52:07.420]  Also, I don't know if I mentioned this, but I was mixing up nutrients for my own garden.
[52:07.420 --> 52:11.420]  Yes, I do use bottled nutrients. I was actually trying to lower the pH of a solution.
[52:11.420 --> 52:15.420]  My pH was a little bit too high. Instead of using pH down or anything,
[52:15.420 --> 52:18.420]  I used liquid karma from Botanicare and it worked very well.
[52:18.420 --> 52:21.420]  It dropped my pH right to where I needed it and I didn't have to use a whole lot.
[52:21.420 --> 52:24.420]  I think that that is actually a useful product.
[52:24.420 --> 52:27.420]  I was able to lower the pH and add something useful to my mix.
[52:27.420 --> 52:30.420]  My point is shake the shit out of your nutrients.
[52:30.420 --> 52:33.420]  Get that bottle and just shake it vigorously for a couple of seconds.
[52:33.420 --> 52:38.420]  You want to stir it up. You want to get everything that's settled on the bottom mixed back into the mix.
[52:38.420 --> 52:40.420]  You want to get all the stuff stirred up in there.
[52:40.420 --> 52:45.420]  You don't want to end up with the last bit of that bottle having all the potency in it
[52:45.420 --> 52:47.420]  and then you end up burning your nutrients or your plants.
[52:47.420 --> 52:52.420]  Shake the shit out of your bottles before you use them. That is my guidance.
[52:52.420 --> 52:57.420]  Also, I feel like it's a good idea that once you've mixed up nutrients for your potted plants,
[52:57.420 --> 53:00.420]  it is a good idea to use that mix within 24 hours.
[53:00.420 --> 53:03.420]  It's not a good idea to let that stuff sit around.
[53:03.420 --> 53:05.420]  Someone's going to argue me and say, but what about hydro?
[53:05.420 --> 53:07.420]  You're mixing that up and running it for seven days.
[53:07.420 --> 53:10.420]  Yes, it is running. It's moving constantly.
[53:10.420 --> 53:13.420]  It's got oxygen added to it and it's not sitting still.
[53:13.420 --> 53:15.420]  It's constantly moving.
[53:15.420 --> 53:18.420]  If you mix up a big tank of water and just let it sit there with nutrients in it,
[53:18.420 --> 53:20.420]  it's going to settle. It's going to get funky.
[53:20.420 --> 53:26.420]  Those products are sold in different bottles because they're supposed to be kept separate until you're using them.
[53:26.420 --> 53:29.420]  Don't mix this stuff up too far in advance.
[53:29.420 --> 53:32.420]  Try to use it within 24 hours and I think it will be more effective.
[53:32.420 --> 53:35.420]  There's no need to brew the synthetic nutrients.
[53:35.420 --> 53:38.420]  We heard that from our friends at Dragonfly Earth Medicine in the last episode.
[53:38.420 --> 53:41.420]  Just mix it up right before you're going to use it.
[53:41.420 --> 53:45.420]  If you don't use it within 24 to 36 hours, you'll start seeing it get funky.
[53:45.420 --> 53:50.420]  If it starts changing colors, starting to stink real bad, just dump it out.
[53:50.420 --> 53:52.420]  Make a fresh mix.
[53:52.420 --> 53:57.420]  I feel like I got myself caught up on the stuff I missed last week and I got through a six-minute intro.
[53:57.420 --> 53:59.420]  I'm going to press pause for a second.
[53:59.420 --> 54:01.420]  I'm going to take a gigantic dab.
[54:01.420 --> 54:08.420]  When I get back, we're going to talk about identifying, preventing, and correcting common issues in your ganja garden.
[54:10.420 --> 54:13.420]  All right, you guys. I am back and I am well medicated.
[54:13.420 --> 54:16.420]  I just took a couple of fat dabs of Cascade Shatter.
[54:16.420 --> 54:19.420]  Cascade is lemon skunk, cross to Daybreaker.
[54:19.420 --> 54:21.420]  I bred that one. I grew the flowers.
[54:21.420 --> 54:24.420]  Then our friend, the Barefoot Grower, did the extraction for us.
[54:24.420 --> 54:26.420]  Great work, my friend.
[54:26.420 --> 54:30.420]  This hash always makes me go completely stupid for a couple of seconds when I smoke it.
[54:30.420 --> 54:32.420]  I completely love it.
[54:32.420 --> 54:33.420]  Good work.
[54:33.420 --> 54:34.420]  All right, let's get back on track.
[54:34.420 --> 54:36.420]  We are talking about insects.
[54:36.420 --> 54:41.420]  You guys, the insects are getting bad here in Colorado because there are so many commercial gardens.
[54:41.420 --> 54:43.420]  There are gardens everywhere.
[54:43.420 --> 54:47.420]  A lot of people here in Colorado grow cannabis at home.
[54:47.420 --> 54:49.420]  It is legal to grow cannabis in your home.
[54:49.420 --> 54:52.420]  I think that everybody should exercise that right.
[54:52.420 --> 54:54.420]  A lot of people are growing cannabis at home.
[54:54.420 --> 54:58.420]  A lot of people work in a commercial cultivation facility.
[54:58.420 --> 55:03.420]  A lot of those people are taking bugs from their home grow to the commercial grow.
[55:03.420 --> 55:10.420]  Then their employees and coworkers are picking up those bugs on their clothes and taking them to their personal grow.
[55:10.420 --> 55:13.420]  Then their friends are coming to their house and sitting next to them.
[55:13.420 --> 55:18.420]  The spider mites are climbing across the couch onto your buddy's T-shirt because he smells like weed too.
[55:18.420 --> 55:23.420]  Then your buddy's going home and going in his garden and putting the spider mites in his garden.
[55:23.420 --> 55:27.420]  The bugs are just being moved around like STDs here in Colorado.
[55:27.420 --> 55:29.420]  They're just everywhere.
[55:29.420 --> 55:34.420]  Everybody works in the industry, so the bugs have no problem getting passed around.
[55:34.420 --> 55:42.420]  Which means everybody here that is paying attention needs to be very diligent about their pest management programs.
[55:42.420 --> 55:49.420]  It's very easy to prevent getting pests, but once you've got pests, it is a huge pain in the ass getting rid of them.
[55:49.420 --> 55:54.420]  I've seen people shut down entire gardens because they cannot get rid of spider mites.
[55:54.420 --> 55:59.420]  It just takes one or two mites to start the party, and it can get ugly really quickly.
[55:59.420 --> 56:02.420]  There's actually a commercial grow in Pueblo that gave up.
[56:02.420 --> 56:05.420]  They're just like, fuck it. We can't get rid of our mite issue.
[56:05.420 --> 56:07.420]  They cut down all of their plants.
[56:07.420 --> 56:09.420]  They closed their facility.
[56:09.420 --> 56:11.420]  The facility is now for sale.
[56:11.420 --> 56:17.420]  Whoever buys that place is going to have to go in there and clean the shit out of it before they're able to grow in there.
[56:17.420 --> 56:25.420]  Let's work our way into talking about identifying, preventing, and correcting some common issues with our ganja plants.
[56:25.420 --> 56:28.420]  Of course, I've got a disclaimer.
[56:28.420 --> 56:31.420]  How you treat your garden is up to you.
[56:31.420 --> 56:38.420]  If you want to use harsh chemicals and harmful pesticides in your garden, that is your decision.
[56:38.420 --> 56:42.420]  If you want to go a more organic route, that is your decision.
[56:42.420 --> 56:48.420]  Just please take some time to read about what you are applying to your crops and read what it can do to people that consume that.
[56:48.420 --> 56:55.420]  Also, if you are applying pesticides outside, please be much more aware of what you're doing.
[56:55.420 --> 56:57.420]  Please try to use organic ingredients.
[56:57.420 --> 57:01.420]  Keep in mind that you are affecting my environment also.
[57:01.420 --> 57:04.420]  You're affecting my child's environment, your child's environment.
[57:04.420 --> 57:06.420]  It's not just yours.
[57:06.420 --> 57:08.420]  You're spraying everybody's environment.
[57:08.420 --> 57:10.420]  Yes, those are your cannabis plants.
[57:10.420 --> 57:14.420]  Yes, that is your property, but who knows what you're doing to the overall environment.
[57:14.420 --> 57:18.420]  The insects that travel from your property to mine don't know any barriers.
[57:18.420 --> 57:20.420]  They don't know any boundaries.
[57:20.420 --> 57:26.420]  Whatever you're doing over there is going to have some sort of an effect on what's going on over here no matter how far apart we are.
[57:26.420 --> 57:31.420]  Please be aware of what you're putting on your garden, what you're spraying, what you're applying.
[57:31.420 --> 57:38.420]  Even if you are releasing beneficial insects, please think about it, read about it, be aware.
[57:38.420 --> 57:39.420]  That's all I want you to do.
[57:39.420 --> 57:41.420]  Just be aware of what you're doing.
[57:41.420 --> 57:45.420]  All right, one more thing before I get into talking about these insects.
[57:45.420 --> 57:54.420]  I started this podcast because there was another podcast that every time somebody asked a question, the host of the podcast would pitch products.
[57:54.420 --> 58:01.420]  He would read an email and talk about an issue in somebody's garden, and then he would talk about a very specific product that would cure your problem.
[58:01.420 --> 58:03.420]  He would tell you where to get it.
[58:03.420 --> 58:07.420]  He would give you a coupon code to get a deal on that product, and it felt very dirty.
[58:07.420 --> 58:12.420]  It did not feel like the host of that show was trying to improve my garden.
[58:12.420 --> 58:18.420]  It felt like he was trying to make money by doing a deal with a pesticide company, and that's not what I'm here for.
[58:18.420 --> 58:23.420]  I will mention products, but I am not paid by any of those companies to sell any products to you.
[58:23.420 --> 58:25.420]  They are products that I know will work.
[58:25.420 --> 58:28.420]  They are products that I use and have used and have experience with.
[58:28.420 --> 58:33.420]  It's the only reason I'm mentioning them is because they work for me, and I think they will work for you.
[58:33.420 --> 58:35.420]  I'm not here to sell you anything.
[58:35.420 --> 58:38.420]  I'm not paid by any pesticide, fungicide.
[58:38.420 --> 58:41.420]  I'm not paid by any grow company at all.
[58:41.420 --> 58:52.420]  I actually think that a better plan instead of buying a product and just spraying a product would be to find the cause of your problem, correct that cause, then eradicate the problem,
[58:52.420 --> 58:55.420]  and then you know that it will never come back.
[58:55.420 --> 59:00.420]  If you simply say, I've got spider mites, and you walk in and you spray a product and you kill all the spider mites, good job.
[59:00.420 --> 59:06.420]  They're dead temporarily, but they're still coming in from somewhere, and you're going to get the same damn problem all over again.
[59:06.420 --> 59:12.420]  So I'm going to talk more about how to prevent and correct issues instead of what to buy to solve your problem.
[59:12.420 --> 59:13.420]  All right.
[59:13.420 --> 59:17.420]  With that being said, let's talk a little bit about spider mites.
[59:18.420 --> 59:24.420]  Spider mites are probably the most common problem and pest in most ganja grows, and especially in most commercial grows.
[59:24.420 --> 59:29.420]  I would say it's a toss-up between powdery mildew and spider mites in Colorado commercial grows.
[59:29.420 --> 59:33.420]  Every grower either has had or will get spider mites at some point.
[59:33.420 --> 59:36.420]  It's something you're going to have to deal with as a cannabis grower.
[59:36.420 --> 59:38.420]  They're very common.
[59:38.420 --> 59:45.420]  There are over 1,000 different species of spider mites, but when you get mites on your cannabis, you are probably going to get the two-spotted mite.
[59:45.420 --> 59:48.420]  That is the most common mite for your cannabis plants.
[59:48.420 --> 59:51.420]  You may run into a mite known as the russet mite.
[59:51.420 --> 59:53.420]  That mite is a bitch.
[59:53.420 --> 59:54.420]  It is way harder to get rid of.
[59:54.420 --> 59:56.420]  It's way harder to control.
[59:56.420 --> 59:57.420]  So hopefully you don't run into those.
[59:57.420 --> 59:59.420]  Hopefully you just get the two-spotted mite.
[59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.420]  Today we're going to talk about the two-spotted spider mite.
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:06.420]  Let's start with talking about how to identify a mite problem.
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.420]  Spider mites give us plenty of warnings and indications that they are there.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.420]  They're easy to identify.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.420]  Once they start showing you they're there.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:16.420]  Sometimes you'll notice the tops of your leaves look like they have been stippled.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.420]  It looks like somebody has just been poking it with a needle and changing the color.
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:25.420]  That is a spider mite on the bottom of that leaf, sticking his little fangs in there, sucking the juice out of your plants.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.420]  Your plants will get stippling.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.420]  It just looks like you've been poking at it.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.420]  Poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, and it's just got little marks on it.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:34.420]  That is the first indicator of a spider mite infestation.
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.420]  The second sign may be webbing.
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.420]  If the top of your buds start getting little webs on there, they start to build like a teepee.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.420]  It just looks like a little cone around the top of your buds.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:47.420]  If you've got that on there, you have got a serious spider mite infestation.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.420]  That is a huge indicator that they are there.
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.420]  They're loving life.
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.420]  They're comfortable.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.420]  They're getting everything they need, and you're going to have to fight to get rid of them.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:01.420]  Another way to tell that you've got spider mites is you may see spider mites on the bottom of the leaves.
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.420]  On the underside of your leaf is where spider mites will live.
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:05.420]  They will be crawling around right there.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.420]  That's also where they lay their eggs.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:10.420]  The mites and the eggs may be visible if they're there enough.
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:15.420]  You may need to get a magnifier if you don't have a lot of them, a 60 to 100X magnifier,
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:18.420]  and just put that on the bottom side of your leaf and watch for something to move.
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.420]  You'll see them climbing around, just little round things.
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.420]  They're ugly as shit.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.420]  They look like little monsters.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.420]  Those are spider mites.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.420]  You need to get rid of them.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:30.420]  Those eggs I was talking about, spider mites are crazy fast breeders.
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.420]  When they have babies, something fucked up about spider mites,
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:36.420]  they have a three to one ratio of females to males.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.420]  That means when four spider mites are born, three of them are girls,
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.420]  which means they're going to reproduce.
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:45.420]  When spider mites reproduce, they lay up to 200 eggs at a time,
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:50.420]  and they can repeat that cycle as often as every eight days if they have the right conditions.
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:51.420]  Guess what?
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.420]  Your grow room is the perfect condition.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.420]  There's nothing in there disrupting them.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.420]  You've got the perfect temperature.
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:57.420]  You've got beautiful humidity.
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.420]  You've got the perfect environment for spider mites.
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.420]  What we need to do is prevent spider mites from getting into the room.
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:07.420]  If we see spider mites, we need to know how to eradicate them.
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.420]  Let's first talk about preventing spider mites.
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:14.420]  Building a well-sealed grow room is a great way to keep spider mites out.
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:19.420]  Go to Hello's or Home Depot and get some of that expanding foam insulation
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.420]  and spray that in every crack in your wall.
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.420]  That way, nothing can climb through those holes.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.420]  Spider mites are tiny.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.420]  They're going to come through every crack, every nook, every cranny,
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.420]  and they are going to get in your garden.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:34.420]  Put up some Panda film, use a bunch of tape, seal off that grow room
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:38.420]  so that you have way less entrance routes for spider mites to come in.
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.420]  They're going to come in from the outside.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.420]  They're also going to come in on your clothes,
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:45.420]  or they're going to come in on an infested plant,
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.420]  or through your ventilation system.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:51.420]  What you need to do is anytime you get a new clone from anybody,
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:54.420]  if it comes from a friend, if it comes from a dispensary,
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:56.420]  if it comes from some dude on Craigslist,
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.420]  wherever you take that plant, before you put it in your garden,
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:03.420]  make sure it is treated properly for bugs and mildew.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:06.420]  You might want to trust your friends.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.420]  You might think you can trust the dispensary.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.420]  You think you can trust that guy off of Craigslist,
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.420]  but you have no idea what they might not know.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.420]  They could have spider mites.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:15.420]  They could have aphids.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.420]  They could have thrips.
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:17.420]  They could have fungus gnats.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.420]  They could have powdery mildew, and they don't even know it,
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.420]  and they just passed it on to you.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.420]  You just gave them money for a clone, and you actually just paid for spider mites.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:28.420]  You got a free collection of spider mites with your new clone.
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:29.420]  That shit happens.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:30.420]  So be careful.
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.420]  Whenever you get a new clone, take it to wherever you're taking it,
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:36.420]  your growth facility, your home, your trap house, your whatever.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.420]  Take it there.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.420]  Don't put it in with the rest of your plants.
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:43.420]  Take it to a quarantined area and spray the shit out of it with some products,
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:47.420]  so that way you can make sure there are no mites on it before you put it in your garden.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.420]  Pyrethrum is a great product for spider mites,
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:53.420]  although some spider mites will develop a resistance and an immunity to it
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.420]  that should work for most of your mite problems.
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:58.420]  Evergreen Pyrethrum is the brand I would recommend.
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:03:59.420]  It's affordable.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.420]  Also, you can use a product called Smite.
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:05.420]  Smite is a natural product made of mostly plant oils,
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:08.420]  and it is actually allowed and approved by the MED.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:13.420]  Both of the products I just listed are allowed and approved in Colorado production facilities,
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:17.420]  so they have been deemed safe by the Colorado Department of Agriculture
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:22.420]  for cannabis plants that will be consumed by humans as a medical product.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.420]  So these two products are deemed safe by the Department of Agriculture.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:27.420]  You guys, I would not use them if they were not deemed safe.
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.420]  I would remove them from my personal grows,
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.420]  and they would have to be removed from any commercial grow I am a part of.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:36.420]  So Evergreen Pyrethrum and Smite for plants that are coming in.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:40.420]  Also, if you are an Azomax user, Azomax is a perfect thing for plants that are coming in.
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:44.420]  Just make sure you treat the clones that are coming in with some sort of miticide.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:47.420]  Whatever level of toxicity you want to use is up to you.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.420]  If you want to go gentle, I'd recommend the Smite.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:53.420]  If you want to use something a little stronger, maybe Azomax.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:56.420]  If you want to go real strong and get crazy with it
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:59.420]  and make sure nothing ever lives in your garden, go ahead and hit it with Floramite.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:00.420]  I can't endorse Floramite.
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.420]  It's a little bit of a potent product,
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:05.420]  and it's actually banned by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:10.420]  You cannot use Floramite in a commercial grow, so you have to consider that.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:12.420]  It's available. You can get it online if you want it.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:16.420]  Whatever products you choose to use, please go to that product's website
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:20.420]  and read the proper application technique and methods for that product.
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.420]  You may think, what, I just mix it up with water,
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.420]  put it in a sprayer, and fucking spray it on the plants, right?
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.420]  Maybe. There may be some other steps.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:28.420]  Floramite needs to be pH adjusted.
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.420]  Floramite needs to be added to water at a very specific temperature.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.420]  There are a couple of extra ingredients for Azomax
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.420]  that you've probably never read and aren't even aware of.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:41.420]  Also, make sure you wear the appropriate clothing and protective equipment.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:45.420]  Personal protective equipment is very important when you're applying pesticides.
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:48.420]  You are applying something that is very concentrated.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:52.420]  You are moving it from the bottle where it's concentrated and diluting it with the water.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.420]  At that concentrated point, it is very dangerous and it is very potent.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:58.420]  Wear something to protect your eyes.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.420]  Those nerdy-looking science lab goggles, get a pair of those.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.420]  Wear them. Nobody's going to laugh at you.
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.420]  Also, protect your hands.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.420]  Wear gloves. Go to the grocery store.
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:11.420]  Go somewhere and get some of those black nitrile gloves.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.420]  Protect your skin and hands.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.420]  When you're spraying, wear long sleeves.
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.420]  Wear a respirator.
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:20.420]  Always wear long pants and shoes when you're applying pesticides.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:22.420]  Cover yourself up.
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:25.420]  You want to eradicate pests, not yourself.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.420]  I feel like that's enough about treating clones that are coming in
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.420]  to not bring spider mites on your new plants.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:35.420]  Also, don't drag spider mites around from your friend's garden to your garden
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:39.420]  or from the commercial girl where you work to your personal garden or vice versa.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:42.420]  Change clothes when traveling from one garden to the other.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.420]  Try to change your clothes. Try to change your shoes.
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.420]  Try to dedicate specific shoes to your garden.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.420]  I've got grow shoes and normal shoes.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.420]  I don't wear the same shoes in the garden that I wear at home.
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.420]  I don't wear those shoes out and about.
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:58.420]  I try to be as careful as I can because I'm in different gardens all the time.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:03.420]  Another thing we should talk about is some sort of a filtration on your ventilation system.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.420]  You've got fresh air coming into the grow room.
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:10.420]  You need filtration on there, especially if the air is coming from outdoors.
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:13.420]  If you're bringing in air from outside, it definitely needs to be filtered.
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:16.420]  You don't want to bring inâ€”maybe one of your neighbors has a male plant outside.
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.420]  You don't want to bring in pollen.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:20.420]  You don't want to bring in insects, and you don't want to bring in mold and mildew
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.420]  and whatever else you could possibly bring in from outside.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:24.420]  Don't invite problems.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:28.420]  If you're bringing air in from outdoors, run it through a HIPAA filter first
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:31.420]  or get yourself one of those Shroom Cloud filters.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.420]  It just goes on the ducting, and it makes sure that nothing can pass through.
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:37.420]  It's got a HIPAA filter, and everything gets caught as it comes in.
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:41.420]  Also, if you're bringing air from one room to another, just put those littleâ€”
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:45.420]  you can buy sheets of HIPAA filters at the hardware store,
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.420]  and you can cut them to the size that you need them.
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:51.420]  Put a strip of duct tape around the edges to where you make a little frame,
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:56.420]  and then just duct tape that shit or staple gun that shit right around all of your ducting,
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:57.420]  any in and out.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.420]  Just duct both sides.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:07:59.420]  Put a piece on both sides.
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:03.420]  It's not going to slow down the air too much, but it will stop bugs from moving around.
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:06.420]  We've got to stop spider mites from moving from room to room,
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.420]  and we have to control them a little bit.
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:13.420]  Put some HIPAA filters and some Shroom Cloud covers over all of your intakes
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.420]  and outtakes and all of your holes.
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.420]  That would help you a lot.
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:20.420]  One more thing you can do to try to prevent getting spider mites in your grow room
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:23.420]  is if you've got pets, if you've got a dog, if you've got a cat,
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.420]  I would recommend keeping that pet away from the grow.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.420]  I know that sounds weird.
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:29.420]  A lot of people like to have their dog in the grow with them.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.420]  That's their buddy.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.420]  I think your dog's probably got bugs on it.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.420]  Don't bring him in there.
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.420]  You can't wash your dog every time you come in there.
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.420]  He's been out rolling in the dirt.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:37.420]  He's been out playing in the grass.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:39.420]  Who knows where he's been?
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.420]  The fucking dog's out running around in the yard, chewing shit up,
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:43.420]  shitting on stuff, getting spider mites on him.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.420]  Don't let him in your garden.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.420]  That's my opinion.
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.420]  All right, we have talked about spider mite identification.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.420]  We have talked about preventation.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:51.420]  Prevention?
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:52.420]  I said preventation.
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.420]  I'm not even going to edit it because that was fucking awesome.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.420]  I said it like I meant it.
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:57.420]  We've talked about preventation.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.420]  That's my new word, you guys.
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:01.420]  Somebody put that on Wikipedia and in a dictionary for me.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:02.420]  Give me credit.
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.420]  Preventation.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:05.420]  I didn't write down preventation.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:06.420]  It says prevention.
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:09.420]  I had to look because I was like, if I wrote down preventation,
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:10.420]  that's when I've got a problem.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:13.420]  We've talked about identification and prevention.
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.420]  Now let's talk about eradification.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:21.420]  To eradicate spider mites, there are several ways to go about getting rid of your spider mite problem.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:24.420]  It kind of depends on what stage of growth your plants are in.
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:27.420]  If you're in the veg stage, it's going to be a simple solution.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.420]  If you are in flower, it's going to take a little bit of consideration.
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:36.420]  Also, you need to decide if you want to go organically, if you want to use beneficial insects,
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:40.420]  or if you want to use harsh chemicals so that you can be sure everything is gone in one application.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.420]  It kind of depends on what your goal is.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:45.420]  Of course, I recommend mostly organic products.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:51.420]  Then once you get later into flower, I would recommend the beneficial insects and predatory mites.
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:59.420]  Let's talk about things you can apply to your crop in veg to get rid of spider mites if you do see that.
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:04.420]  One thing you can do that works immediately, you can pull off a leaf that is infested with mites.
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:06.420]  You can just grab the entire leaf, yank it right off the plant.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.420]  Now it's not even part of the plant.
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:13.420]  Put that in a trash bag, seal that trash bag up, remove that from the grow, and throw it away.
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:15.420]  You've just taken care of those mites.
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:20.420]  There are probably more mites somewhere, but at least you've gotten rid of that little colony, that whole leaf worth of spider mites.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.420]  Don't be afraid to defoliate.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:25.420]  You can do this from day one all the way up to harvest.
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:27.420]  You can just pull off leaves.
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:30.420]  It won't do much damage to the plant if you leave enough leaf for the plant to survive.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:32.420]  Don't be afraid. Just go in there and defoliate.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.420]  This applies to powdery mildew also.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.420]  Feel free to just pull off those infected leaves.
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:40.420]  Defoliation is your very first step.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.420]  It's free, it's simple, and it works.
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:46.420]  Your next step, you can think about what you may want to spray onto the plant.
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:49.420]  You can apply things like we talked about earlier.
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.420]  You can use the pyrethrum spray.
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.420]  You can use Smite.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.420]  You can use Azimax.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.420]  There are a thousand products in between that you can use.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.420]  Mighty Wash works.
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.420]  There are a whole bunch of other products.
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.420]  Read what works for you.
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:05.420]  Read about what you want to do if spraying is the way you'd like to go about it.
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:12.420]  If you feel like you want to spray, but you aren't interested in using a commercially made synthetic pesticide or an organic pesticide,
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:15.420]  you can make your own worm compost tea,
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:18.420]  and you can make all kinds of teas and apply those to the plants.
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:23.420]  Those beneficial bacteria that come with those teas may run off your spider mites.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:28.420]  I cannot guarantee it, but I know it's a possibility if you use the right products in your tea.
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:31.420]  That's not something I am completely experienced with,
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:35.420]  but as I'm talking about it, I'm sure that Sean and Will and Frosty would all be yelling at me,
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:36.420]  and they'd be saying,
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:40.420]  bro, just make a fucking tea and spray it on those fucking plants, and they'll be just fine.
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.420]  That way, you don't have to use any pesticides.
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.420]  Think about a tea.
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:47.420]  A tea would probably work for you to control a spider mite infestation.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:49.420]  I don't know that it would completely eradicate it.
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:53.420]  Since we're talking about teas, put a little neem or carangameal in that tea.
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:55.420]  That's going to knock out your spider mites.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:00.420]  We're going to talk about botanical oils and stuff like neem after I talk about this part.
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.420]  In flower.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:04.420]  Once you're in flower, you don't want to spray things onto your plants
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.420]  because it's going to fuck up your buds.
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.420]  It's going to make your buds taste terrible.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.420]  It's going to stay on your buds.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:14.420]  When you're in flower, you're going to need to consider how far into flower you are,
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:17.420]  how far away from harvest you are, how dense those buds are.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:19.420]  You need to think about when you apply this pesticide,
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.420]  is it still going to be there when I harvest?
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.420]  Is it going to leave residuals?
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:26.420]  Is it going to make my buds and or concentrates taste funny?
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.420]  That's stuff you need to think about.
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.420]  Is it harmful to humans if they do consume it?
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:32.420]  Those are all things you need to think about.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:35.420]  Early in flower, you might be able to get away with spraying.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:40.420]  After week three, I would not even consider spraying something on my plants.
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:44.420]  Well, I may spray some fungus tea and some push on the plants after week three.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:48.420]  I like to use push one time at the start of week four, but that's just me.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:52.420]  Keep in mind that everything you spray on these plants is going to end up in your concentrate.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:59.420]  If you plan on making hash, I would not recommend using neem oil or other essential oils or botanical oils
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:03.420]  because your hash and your concentrates will taste like those oils.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:07.420]  I just talked about not spraying your plants and you've still got spider mites.
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:08.420]  You're like, what the fuck am I going to do?
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.420]  I've still got an option for you.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.420]  This is where beneficial insects come in.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:16.420]  You can use beneficial insects from the very beginning.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:17.420]  You can use them in veg.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.420]  You can use them as preventative.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.420]  You can order them online.
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:23.420]  I would actually recommend, I've got this catalog in my hand right here.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:25.420]  I'm turning to the front page.
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:28.420]  This company is called Arbico Organics.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:30.420]  A-R-B-I-C-O Organics.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.420]  They do not pay me at all.
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.420]  I just really enjoy this catalog.
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:36.420]  This catalog comes every couple of months.
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:41.420]  The very first page has a what is IPM little lesson here.
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:43.420]  It's just a one page on what is integrated pest management.
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:49.420]  I may actually turn this little leaflet page into an entire episode in the future because it is very useful.
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:52.420]  But this magazine, and once again, they don't pay me, you guys.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.420]  I'm sorry, this sounds like a fucking ad, but it's genuine.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:57.420]  In this magazine, I've just opened it up to a couple of pages.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.420]  Right now, you can order ladybugs.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.420]  You can order praying mantis.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.420]  You can order green lacewigs.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:02.420]  You can order assassin bugs.
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.420]  You can order minute pirate bugs.
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:07.420]  There are aphid parasites, aphid predators.
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.420]  But here's where I'm headed.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:12.420]  In this magazine, you can order predatory mites.
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:19.420]  There are spider mites that do not eat cannabis plants, but they do eat other spider mites.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:20.420]  You order these.
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:21.420]  They come in little packages.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:22.420]  They come in a variety of different ways.
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:24.420]  I've seen them delivered in different ways.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:26.420]  Other companies do them other ways.
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:32.420]  The way I'm most familiar with and I like the best, they come in things that look like a tea bag, and they have a little hanger on it.
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:36.420]  You just hang that from your plants, and the predatory mites will come out when the lights go off.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:39.420]  They'll get hungry, and they'll go running around looking for something to eat.
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:43.420]  They're going to find your spider mite infestation, and there's going to be a battle.
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:47.420]  90% of the time, these predatory mites are going to win.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:50.420]  Like I was saying earlier, you can use predatory mites.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:55.420]  You can introduce predatory mites and any other sort of predators into your garden as early as you would like.
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:58.420]  You can use these year-round indoors.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:02.420]  They're great for greenhouses, and honestly, they are ideal for outdoors.
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:07.420]  They're best for outdoors because they're only going to destroy your damaging spider mites,
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.420]  and they're not going to mess up your atmosphere, the ecosystem, the agriculture.
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:14.420]  They're just going to eat the spider mites, and you won't even notice they're there.
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:17.420]  Let's talk about some of the predator mites that I would recommend.
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:21.420]  Right now, I'm working with a commercial cultivation center with a lot of lights.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:28.420]  We've got well over 100 lights in there, and their integrated pest management system includes a spider mite called,
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:31.420]  and I'm going to mess up the name of this guy, but he is called the Swirsky mite.
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:34.420]  He is the S-W-I-R-S-K-I-I.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:36.420]  I think that's called Swirsky.
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:42.420]  I've heard it pronounced multiple different ways, but the Swirsky mite is somebody that I release quite frequently in the commercial grow.
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:47.420]  Also, another predatory mite that we use in the commercial grow is a guy called the Persimilis.
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:51.420]  He is actually known as Phytocilius persimilis.
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:52.420]  Don't worry about the names.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:54.420]  As long as you see these in the catalog or online, you'll be able to order it.
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:59.420]  The one you're looking for is spelled P-E-R-S-I-M-I-L-I-S.
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:05.420]  That's the Persimilis, and the Swirsky, again, was S-W-I-R-S-K-I-I.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:11.420]  Then I've got one more predatory mite for you to help you get rid of spider mites, and this guy is known as the Andersoni.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:14.420]  A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N-I.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:18.420]  All of these guys together will eat up all of your spider mites.
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.420]  They're very affordable.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:22.420]  I think it's very effective, and it is very eco-friendly.
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.420]  Order these spider mites.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:26.420]  They'll come in the mail.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:32.420]  Have it set up to where they come at their scheduled interval so that you remember to apply them to your garden at the right time.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:33.420]  Set up a schedule.
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:35.420]  I think it's like a subscription is what you might call that.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:36.420]  Set up your subscription.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.420]  They will come in the mail.
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:40.420]  You need to open the box, and then you'll just find however they're shipped.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:41.420]  They ship in different ways.
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:43.420]  Like I said, a lot of them come in little tea bags.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.420]  Some of them come in little satchels.
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:46.420]  Just however they come.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:48.420]  I think it's a satchet.
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:50.420]  Just put those at the bottom of the canopy.
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:52.420]  Hopefully, you lollipopped your plants.
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:53.420]  You've got some naked legs.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:59.420]  Then right where the canopy starts and there's foliage, hang those bug packs right there.
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:05.420]  If you can afford all three, if you choose to use all three of these spider mites, I would put one of each.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.420]  Just pick a spot maybe every six or eight feet apart.
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.420]  It depends on how big your garden is.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:13.420]  Just pick an interval and just put one of each of these packages in that spot.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:20.420]  Your little army of mites will start coming out, and they'll just start finding little food sources, and they'll start eating the shit out of all your bad spider mites.
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.420]  Hopefully, they will get rid of them.
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.420]  Here's one thing I need to mention.
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:30.420]  If you're going to use beneficial insects, you cannot spray pesticides because it will kill your beneficial insects.
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:38.420]  If you want to mix a spray with beneficial insects, you need to learn what will not kill those insects that you can spray onto your plants.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:47.420]  Maybe you're using a Swirsky mite, and you've got a spray that you can apply to the plants that the mite needs to take a bite out of a plant before it is affected by that pesticide.
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:53.420]  You would be able to apply that to the plants because the Swirsky mite is not going to take a bite out of your cannabis plant.
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.420]  It will not hurt your Swirsky mite.
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:18:01.420]  However, if you sprayed Smite on the Swirskys, it will kill them because it mainly works by suffocating the bugs.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:04.420]  You have to think about what you're going to use.
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:09.420]  Read as much as you can and plan ahead because these insects, they are affordable, but they are not free.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:12.420]  You don't want to buy bugs and release them and then kill them.
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:15.420]  That seems a little counterproductive to me.
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:18.420]  I feel like we have identified spider mites.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:22.420]  We have learned how to prevent spider mites, and we have learned how to eradicate them.
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:27.420]  Once they're gone, you have to think about how you got them, and you have to make sure they don't come back.
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:37.420]  If they got in through a crack in the wall, if they got in through a clone that you brought, if they got in on your dreadlocks because you've got spider mites at the commercial grow, however it happened, make sure you correct it.
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:39.420]  Make sure you start doing things to prevent it.
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:50.420]  If you work in a commercial grow, if you're around other grows, if you're a grow consultant, if you're in the marijuana, cannabis industry, wherever you are, you're going to have to take stronger measures than most folks.
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:55.420]  You may want to start releasing these predator mites in your own garden every two weeks just to do it.
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:19:00.420]  You may want to start spraying something at the first and 15th of every month to make sure you don't get an issue.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:02.420]  You're going to have to pay attention.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:10.420]  Once you do see a sign of spider mites, you cannot put it off until tomorrow because they reproduce more quickly than rabbits.
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:11.420]  It's fucking ridiculous.
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:16.420]  You could put it off until tomorrow, and then tomorrow those spider mites will have enveloped that entire plant in a web.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.420]  It'll look like you're growing cotton trees.
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.420]  If you see spider mites, get in there today and deal with them.
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.420]  Don't let the spider mites win.
[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:25.420]  They're getting out of hand.
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:27.420]  All right, let's move on from spider mites a little bit.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:32.420]  I've been gone for a little while and my throat's starting to burn out, and I still want to do one, maybe two more issues.
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:35.420]  Let's get down to fungus gnats.
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:37.420]  Fungus gnats are super easy to identify.
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:40.420]  They're little black flies that fly around your soil.
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:42.420]  When you water, they probably come flying out.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:48.420]  If you walk up to the plant and just tap the root ball and tap the soil or tap the pot, they'll probably come flying out of there.
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:49.420]  They're probably all over your grow by now.
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.420]  You see them, they're fucking annoying.
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.420]  They are very easy to identify.
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:57.420]  Fungus gnats are also very easy to prevent and get rid of.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:03.420]  One very helpful way to prevent from getting fungus gnats is to keep your soil dry at the top.
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:09.420]  Fungus gnats like a nice moist area, so if you let that top layer of the soil dry out, they won't want to come around.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:15.420]  Another good way to prevent fungus gnats that seems really easy but some people might overlook is a screen.
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:17.420]  Put a screen on every window.
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:22.420]  Also, those HEPA filters we were talking about for spider mites, all of that stuff is applicable for a fungus gnat.
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:24.420]  They're little flying insects.
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:25.420]  They're super tiny.
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:26.420]  They can get in any crack.
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:27.420]  They can come through any window.
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.420]  They want to come to the moisture.
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:30.420]  They want to come land on your soil.
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:33.420]  They breed in the top layer of soil, and then they fly away.
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:35.420]  Their only purpose is to breed and reproduce.
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:39.420]  Fungus gnats don't have any other purpose except to reproduce.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:40.420]  All right, so we've put up a screen.
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:43.420]  We've gotten rid of any excess moisture in the top layer of our soil.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:46.420]  Now, we have prevented fungus gnats from coming around.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:53.420]  The next couple things I'm going to talk about can work as prevention, and they can also work as ways to eradicate the fungus gnats.
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:56.420]  If you want to use these products before the fungus gnats get there, you can do that.
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:59.420]  Or if you want to wait until you already have them, that's also an option.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:05.420]  Something that is very affordable, if you have a small personal garden, I like to use what are known as mosquito dunks.
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.420]  They sell them at every hardware store.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:08.420]  They sell them at Big R.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:09.420]  They sell them at Lowe's.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.420]  They sell them at Home Depot.
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:20.420]  They're little round, donut-looking, cookie-looking things that are used to drop into a pond or standing water to keep mosquitoes from gathering around that water.
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:26.420]  The way that I like to use them to get rid of or prevent fungus gnats is I will fill my reservoir with water.
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.420]  I will mix my nutrients just like normal.
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:37.420]  Then I just drop the mosquito dunk right in there, let it soften up for a little bit, and then I wear rubber gloves and just grind it up into a small powder to where it just dissolves into the water.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:43.420]  Then as I'm watering the plants, I push it to the side and make sure to get a little bit for every plant.
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:46.420]  A little bit of that stuff that I can see goes into each plant.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:55.420]  I would assume that the smaller stuff that broke up that I can't see is getting even more distributed, but I like that there's some that I can see so I can judge a little bit of how much I'm putting per plant.
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:57.420]  The mosquito dunks are very affordable.
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:04.420]  They're available at most of your local hardware stores or your feed stores, or if you've got a ranch store or something around you, they've probably got them there.
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.420]  There's another product known as Natrol.
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:13.420]  Natrol is the same ingredient as the mosquito dunks, but it is much more concentrated and it will definitely work for you.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:16.420]  You can also use the evergreen pyrethrum.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:18.420]  That will work as a drench.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:19.420]  I don't remember the dilution rate.
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:20.420]  Read the bottle.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:23.420]  It will tell you how much evergreen to put per gallon of water.
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:27.420]  Apply that to your soil as a drench, and that will remove your fungus gnats.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.420]  You can also use a product called Grandivo.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:31.420]  Grandivo will work for you.
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:38.420]  If you use the evergreen and the Grandivo together, you will get rid of your fungus gnats forever in two applications.
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:45.420]  If you want to be preventative and you don't want to use a beneficial bacteria or a spray pesticide, you can use diatomaceous earth.
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.420]  Diatomaceous earth has little sharp points on it.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:50.420]  It's a little rough texture.
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:51.420]  It's like little rocks.
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:55.420]  It's like really sharp Rice Krispies or something like that.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:58.420]  Apply a layer of that to the top of your soil.
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.420]  Cover the soil completely.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:02.420]  The bugs can't climb in and out of there because it cuts them up.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.420]  It kills them when they try to get in and out.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:06.420]  They don't want anything to do with that.
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:11.420]  One hint, wait for the soil to dry mostly and then apply the diatomaceous earth onto there.
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:14.420]  Let it sit as long as you can before you water.
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:19.420]  Another thing you can use to keep these fungus gnats away is a product called Spinosad.
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:21.420]  There are a lot of products that contain Spinosad.
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:24.420]  Monterey Garden Spray does contain Spinosad.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:25.420]  You can spray that on the leaves.
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.420]  You can do a soil drench with it.
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.420]  Actually, here's something that I should mention.
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:39.420]  If you are going to use the evergreen pyrethrums or the Spinosad as a soil drench, you should also spray the foliage because those fungus gnats are going to fly out of the soil there.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:42.420]  They're going to land on the leaves and just chill out there and start living there for a little while.
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:47.420]  If you're going to do a soil drench, also do a foliar application of whichever product you choose.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:52.420]  If it's the evergreen pyrethrums or if it's the Spinosad from Monterey Garden Spray.
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:55.420]  Let's talk about one more thing with fungus gnats.
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:56.420]  You knew this was coming.
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:24:02.420]  The 100% organic way to get rid of your fungus gnats would be fungus gnat predators.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:05.420]  I'm going to try to read you the name out of this catalog, but it is a lot of letters.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:09.420]  It looks like it would read hypoaspis miles to me.
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:16.420]  The hypoaspis miles fungus gnat predator, I'll spell it for you, H-Y-P-O-A-S-P-I-S.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:21.420]  Then the word miles, hypoaspis miles fungus gnat predator.
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:28.420]  Those would be the beneficial insects I would recommend to control and eradicate your fungus gnat infestation.
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:34.420]  All right, you guys. I feel like that pretty much covers spider mites and fungus gnats.
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:38.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, at the top of the show, I know I said I was going to try to cover three topics.
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:41.420]  I know I said I was going to try to get to whiteflies, but I've been gone for a long time.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:43.420]  Honestly, my throat's getting a little bit tired.
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:55.420]  Instead of faking it and just phoning in the last half of this episode, I'm going to make whiteflies the first issue we deal with on the part two of how to identify, prevent, and correct common garden issues.
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:58.420]  Please stay tuned for that one. It'll be coming up very soon.
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:04.420]  I appreciate you for listening to this. I hope you learned a whole bunch about spider mites and fungus gnats.
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:08.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the part of the podcast where I tell you all about Patreon.
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:13.420]  Patreon is a service where you can sign up to financially contribute to the podcast.
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:15.420]  You can make a donation for the podcast.
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:26.420]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a dollar or two, if you feel like you learned something, or if I helped you improve your garden and you would like to contribute to the show, what you can do is go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:33.420]  Patreon is P-A-T-R-E-O-N, Patreon, patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:37.420]  Create an account, and then you'll be able to sign up to contribute to the podcast.
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:42.420]  I know that you can contribute as little as $1, and I honestly don't think there's a limit on how much you can contribute.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:47.420]  What I plan to do with your contributions is I am using those funds to keep my website alive.
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:54.420]  I read geneticscolorado.com costs me money to keep hosted every year, and I'm using the funds that you guys contribute to pay for that hosting.
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:59.420]  I am also going to use the funds to replace these microphone covers because all the guests come and spit into them.
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:05.420]  I just ordered a new memory card for my Zoom H6. I will use funds for that from the Patreon account.
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:14.420]  If you feel like the show was worth a couple of bucks or a buck or whatever you can contribute, I would appreciate it if you go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart and help me out if you can.
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.420]  You guys, I'm not begging. This podcast is always going to be free.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:25.420]  I want to give you free grow lessons and free grow advice from my heart because I love cannabis, and I love helping people, and I love watching people improve their gardens.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:30.420]  The look on somebody's face when they learn a trick and they grow pot better next time, it's fucking priceless to me.
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:37.420]  That's why I do this, but it is not free. It costs me money to host my website. It costs me money to buy the things that I need for the show.
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.420]  I don't mind doing it, but if you'd like to contribute, I would appreciate it. That's all.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:44.420]  I'm not trying to beg. I'm not trying to get rich. I just want to offset the cost of the website.
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:52.420]  It costs me over $300 for hosting per year because I put out so much content, and the episodes are long, and they're high quality, so I use a lot of bandwidth.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:57.420]  You guys listen a lot, so there's a lot of bandwidth going on, so it costs me a little bit, and I'm just asking for help.
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:00.420]  I'm not begging. It sounds like I'm begging, so I'm going to wrap it up, but patreon.com.
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:06.420]  If you cannot contribute to Patreon, I still love you. I still want you to listen to the podcast. We're still friends.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:10.420]  What you can do to help me is you can go to iTunes. You can go to the iTunes store.
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:18.420]  You can search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast, and you can type in a review and let me know what you think about the podcast, and I will read your review on a future episode.
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:21.420]  While you're there, you're given the option to give me an amount of stars.
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:24.420]  So far, everybody has given me a five-star rating.
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:28.420]  Click on the amount of stars that you feel I deserve, and I would appreciate your rating in iTunes.
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:33.420]  If you're not able to rate me in iTunes because you're not an iTunes user, simply share the podcast on Twitter.
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:36.420]  Follow me on Twitter. It's at GFYHpodcast.
[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:39.420]  When I post the tweet about the new episode, simply retweet it for me.
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:42.420]  That's all I'm asking for you. Just help me get the word out about the podcast.
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:48.420]  I would appreciate all of your help because if you don't feel like pushing anything, if you just want to listen and grow better cannabis, I still love you.
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:52.420]  Keep growing. Grow from your heart. That's what I'm doing. I'm here to help you every week.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:56.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's all I've got for you this week. My throat is burnt out. I'm out of oxygen.
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:28:00.420]  I want to thank you guys for listening. I'm going to wrap it up for this week.
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:02.420]  I want to give a huge shout-out to my buddy, Dr. Hambone.
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:06.420]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:29.300]  It's so frustrating.
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:29:01.700]  We understand things we need to do.
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:05.700]  But you, you won't let me fuck.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:07.700]  You say the mood ain't right.
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:10.700]  I really need to bust a nut.
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:13.700]  I know that pussy's tight.
[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:17.700]  She won't let me fuck. Give it to me, baby.
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:20.700]  I really need to bust a nut.
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:24.700]  Her heart is still broken.
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:35.100]  She's trying to recover.
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:30:04.790]  She won't let me fuck. Give it to me, baby.
[01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:07.790]  I really need to bust a nut.
[01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:10.790]  You know just what I need.
[01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:12.790]  She won't let me fuck.
[01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:16.260]  Girl, you're drinking all my beer.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:18.260]  I really need to bust a nut.
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:20.260]  You're smoking all my weed.
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:23.260]  You rub your ass against me.
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:29.900]  Shake that ass. Shake, shake that ass.
[01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:32.900]  I asked you for your number.
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:35.900]  And you said, hell no.
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:39.900]  That's all right. Hey, fuck that bitch. Look at that one over there, cuz.
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.900]  You always hang around me.
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:31:01.720]  Now I get offended.
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:10.450]  When you cum, cuz I'm tired of my organs.
[01:31:10.450 --> 01:31:15.450]  Your organs going up and down.
[01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:19.450]  That's suck, cuz she won't let me fuck.
[01:31:19.450 --> 01:31:22.450]  Give it to me, baby.
[01:31:22.450 --> 01:31:25.450]  I really need to bust a nut.
[01:31:25.450 --> 01:31:28.450]  Don't play with my head again.
[01:31:28.450 --> 01:31:31.450]  She won't let me fuck. Let me get it, baby.
[01:31:31.450 --> 01:31:34.450]  I really need to bust a nut.
[01:31:34.450 --> 01:31:38.850]  Are you a lesbian?
[01:31:38.850 --> 01:31:41.850]  Oh, let me lick it, baby.
[01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:44.850]  Yeah, let's stick it, honey.
[01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:47.850]  I'll give you my money.
[01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:50.850]  Girl, you can have it all.
[01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:52.850]  Go ahead and have a ball.
[01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:56.850]  If you want, you can take them both, baby.
[01:31:56.850 --> 01:32:01.850]  In the year 2000, I see thousand of pretty young women I find arousing.
[01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:03.850]  Grocery store shopping, magazine browsing.
[01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:06.850]  Many different ways they keep their hairstyles in.
[01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:08.850]  Full of boredom, I walk toward them.
[01:32:08.850 --> 01:32:12.850]  Get them close to me, cuz I'm supposed to be the male aggressor.
[01:32:12.850 --> 01:32:14.850]  Female impressor, say the right things.
[01:32:14.850 --> 01:32:16.850]  Possibly undress her, but that's the post game.
[01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:18.850]  This is still the pre game.
[01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:19.850]  Silly woman, she game.
[01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:20.850]  Baby, what's your name?
[01:32:20.850 --> 01:32:23.850]  Even though I'm a freak, I play it off like a college geek.
[01:32:23.850 --> 01:32:26.850]  Crack a smile and politely speak with intellect.
[01:32:26.850 --> 01:32:29.850]  To the woman I select, hoping that she won't detect.
[01:32:29.850 --> 01:32:35.850]  My egotistical, chauvinistical lust I thrust till I scream like mystical.
[01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:37.850]  The wrong message I hope I'm not sending.
[01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:39.850]  Laughing and pretending my dick's not extending.
[01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:41.850]  Can't be overzealous, she might discover.
[01:32:41.850 --> 01:32:44.850]  She's walking away, yikes, blew my cover.
[01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:46.850]  She won't let me fuck.
[01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:48.850]  You know I love it, yeah.
[01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:51.850]  I really need a bus tonight.
[01:32:51.850 --> 01:32:54.850]  Please don't change subject, baby.
[01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:55.850]  She won't let me fuck.
[01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:57.850]  We could've fucked all night long.
[01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:00.850]  I really need a bus tonight.
[01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:03.850]  But your telephone number is wrong.
[01:33:03.850 --> 01:33:04.850]  She won't let me fuck.
[01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:06.850]  Girl, you got a lot to give her.
[01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:09.850]  I really need a bus tonight.
[01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:12.850]  You dress so provocative.
[01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:14.850]  She won't let me fuck.
[01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:17.850]  I can see your lingerie from your hallway.
[01:33:17.850 --> 01:33:20.850]  I really need a bus tonight, bitch.
[01:33:20.850 --> 01:33:22.850]  You must think I'm gay.
[01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:26.850]  So impressive.
[01:33:26.850 --> 01:33:28.850]  Look at that.
[01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:30.850]  Hey, cuz.
[01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:31.850]  Hey, cuz, look at that.
[01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:33.850]  Don't make me, baby.
[01:33:33.850 --> 01:33:35.850]  Baby, let me rub your leg.
[01:33:35.850 --> 01:33:40.250]  Don't make me cry.
[01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:43.250]  Look into my eye.
[01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:45.250]  Girl, you so damn pretty.
[01:33:45.250 --> 01:34:11.940]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:15.940]  It's time for episode number 181 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:19.940]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:21.940]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:24.940]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:28.940]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:31.940]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.940]  I'm your host, my friends, Kwame Rostajef.
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:35.940]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:39.940]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout-out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.940]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:46.940]  Big shout-out to Kat, Kool, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:50.940]  Yeah, I hope you guys are having a great day, great morning, evening, nighttime,
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.940]  whatever time it is, wherever you are.
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:53.940]  I hope you're having a great time.
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:55.940]  I hope you're smoking something with me.
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.940]  I'm smoking some Cascade Shatter.
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:58.940]  I grew the flowers.
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:01.940]  Our friend, the Barefoot Grower, did the extraction for me.
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:03.940]  I want to give a huge shout-out to our friends at Elevate Glass
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:05.940]  for keeping me supplied with fresh, clean glass.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:09.940]  Also, I need to give a huge shout-out to my friend, Tater.
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:11.940]  Big shout-out to Tater Glass for the custom pencil.
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:16.940]  I've got a brand new Rasta-colored pencil dabber with a custom carb cap at the end of it
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:17.940]  so I can carb my banger.
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:18.940]  Big shout-out to Tater Glass.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:19.940]  Big shout-out to Tater Glass.
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:22.940]  Also, big shout-out to Jenny Beth for the amazing Valentine's Day gift.
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:24.940]  Thank you. I appreciate that very much.
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:26.940]  I've been using the shit out of this thing.
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:27.940]  It is super sticky.
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:28.940]  Should probably clean it.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:30.940]  Big shout-out to all the folks that take good care of me.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.940]  Yeah.
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:34.940]  Since I'm doing shout-outs,
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:36.940]  I'll give a shout-out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:37.940]  That's right. If you need some hoodies printed,
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:39.940]  if you need T-shirts printed,
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:40.940]  if you need stickers made,
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:42.940]  if you need hat pins made,
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:46.940]  I can't recommend anyone better than my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:47.940]  That's right. Handmade Apparel.
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:49.940]  They make my Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodies.
[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:51.940]  They make the iRegenetics T-shirts.
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:54.940]  They've made my iRegenetics hat pins.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:57.940]  They make most of my friends' T-shirts in the cannabis industry.
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:00.940]  They make a lot of the hat pins you see in the cannabis industry.
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:03.940]  You guys, I fully recommend Handmade Apparel.
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:05.940]  Check them out at HandmadeApparel.biz
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:07.940]  and let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:09.940]  Let them know you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:14.940]  and they will take very good care of you on your custom printing needs.
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:17.940]  All right. This episode is going to be part two of preventing,
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:22.940]  identifying, and eradicating your common garden pests and issues.
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:23.940]  Wow, that's hard to say.
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:25.940]  That's a lot of words for a podcast title,
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:27.940]  but this is going to be part two of all that stuff.
[01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:30.940]  Before we get to talking about new issues,
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:34.940]  I need to mention some stuff I forgot in the last episode.
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:36.940]  In the last episode, we talked about fungus gnats
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:38.940]  and we also talked about spider mites.
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:40.940]  When we spoke about spider mites,
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:43.940]  I forgot to mention one helpful thing.
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:47.940]  You guys, if you start seeing spider mite webbing developing in your plants,
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:49.940]  you can easily vacuum it up with a shop vac.
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:51.940]  Hang on to the plant very carefully,
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:52.940]  get the shop vac,
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:55.940]  and just suck those spider mite webs right the fuck off of there.
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.940]  Honestly, if you've got spider mite webs, you've got big problems.
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.940]  You need to get through that harvest.
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:01.940]  You need to clean that up,
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:04.940]  and then you need to figure out why there are spider mites in your grow.
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:05.940]  You need to correct that issue.
[01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:06.940]  You need to seal your gaps.
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:07.940]  You need to use some pesticides.
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.940]  You need to use some predator bugs.
[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:12.940]  You need to get rid of the mites if you've got that big of an issue,
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:18.940]  but the shop vac will certainly work to help you clean up spider mite webbing
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:19.940]  should it be there in your grow.
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:21.940]  One more thing I should talk about.
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:25.940]  Another way to really easily find an issue in your garden
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:28.940]  is to be there every day and just take a look.
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:29.940]  You guys, pay attention.
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:30.940]  Look around in the grow.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:31.940]  See what's going on.
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:32.940]  Look at the plants.
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:34.940]  Everybody stares into the plants all day.
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:35.940]  Stare with a purpose.
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:36.940]  Look at the leaves.
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:37.940]  See if you see any stippling.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.940]  See if you see little bugs.
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:40.940]  Tap the soil.
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:41.940]  See if bugs fly up out of the soil.
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:42.940]  Shake the plants.
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.940]  See if bugs fly up out of the foliage.
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:45.940]  Look around the room.
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:47.940]  See if anything looks out of place.
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:51.940]  Look and see if you have some sort of leak or drip coming from an air conditioner
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:52.940]  or a dehumidifier.
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:53.940]  Just pay attention.
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:58.940]  The best way to find an issue early is to look every day and pay attention and be there.
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:00.940]  All you've got to do is go there and look around.
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:01.940]  Just pay some attention.
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:02.940]  Take some time in the grow.
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:05.940]  I like to walk in and just pull a leaf from a random plant.
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.940]  I try to pick a different plant every day.
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:08.940]  Pick one leaf.
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:09.940]  Flip it upside down.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:12.940]  Make sure there are no bugs, no issues on the bottom side of that leaf.
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:13.940]  Turn it.
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:14.940]  Look at the top side of the leaf.
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:15.940]  There's hardly ever problems on the top side.
[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:17.940]  You can see it from far away if there are.
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:18.940]  Grab some leaves.
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:19.940]  Pull them off the plants.
[01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:22.940]  Take a look and see if you notice any issues.
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:27.940]  Okay, another really easy and simple way to prevent problems in your garden
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:29.940]  is to simply clean up after yourself.
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:30.940]  Don't leave leaves on the floor.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:32.940]  Don't leave dirt on the floor.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.940]  Don't leave your tools in the grow room.
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:37.940]  And if you bought some soil and you plan on doing some transplanting,
[01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:41.940]  don't bring that soil into the grow room until you can properly treat it
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:42.940]  and be sure that there are not bugs in it.
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:47.940]  I should mention that a lot of soil that you purchase comes with free insects.
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:50.940]  A lot of people complain about specific brands having insects in it.
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:55.940]  Honestly, all of the soil is eventually stored in the same place.
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:59.940]  If whatever brand you choose, if it's Fox Farms, if it's Roots Organics,
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.940]  if it's whoever else, those are just the first two I thought of.
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:06.940]  If it's brand A, brand B, and brand C, they are all made by different companies, right?
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:11.940]  But then they're all put on a truck and they are all sent to whatever king fucking hydro supply
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:14.940]  in whatever place and they're all stored in one warehouse there
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:19.940]  until they're shipped out to smaller warehouses, to smaller warehouses, to retail stores.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:21.940]  So they're all shipped to one place.
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:24.940]  And in that one place, I imagine it's just a fucking bug farm.
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:27.940]  Every thrip and fungus net and spider mite is just in there
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:30.940]  plotting to take over your garden right now.
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:32.940]  So when new soil comes, you have to pay attention to what's in there.
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:34.940]  That's a great way to get bugs.
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:36.940]  I forgot to mention that in the last episode.
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:40.940]  So be clean and pay the fuck attention.
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:41.940]  One more thing we should talk about.
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:43.940]  A lot of people were like, hey, what about ladybugs?
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:47.940]  Can't I use ladybugs in my garden to help keep pests away?
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:50.940]  Ladybugs are really cute, but they are not that aggressive.
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:55.940]  I don't feel that they eat enough problematic bugs to be worth their money.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:58.940]  If you do get some ladybugs, release them in the grow.
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:01.940]  Take a bunch of photography because they're really cute.
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:05.940]  And then in the next morning, get out the shop vac and vacuum up all the dead
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:09.940]  goddamn ladybugs because most of them are going to die within the first 24 to 48 hours.
[01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:11.940]  They're really not that useful.
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:15.940]  In my opinion, in an indoor grow, when they die, they stink.
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:16.940]  You step on them.
[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:17.940]  They're crunchy.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:18.940]  You find them in your ducting.
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:21.940]  You find them all over the place.
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:25.940]  Also, you guys, I don't really think a praying mantis is too beneficial in a garden.
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:28.940]  They mostly eat things like aphids and soft-bodied insects.
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:30.940]  They won't really go after too many spider mites.
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:31.940]  They aren't that aggressive.
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:36.940]  What I'm getting at is if you are going to employ predator insects, it is way more worth
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:42.940]  your time, your budget, and your energy to research and purchase the correct predatory
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:44.940]  insect for your problem.
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:50.940]  For every insect that I mention in these problem episodes, I'm going to try to include a
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:55.940]  predatory insect that will control that pest problem.
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:41:00.940]  Eventually, I'll do a full episode focused on beneficial insects and predator bugs, but
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:04.940]  for now, I'll just include one or two predators for each problem that we face.
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:10.940]  You guys, if you are looking to employ and use predator mites in an integrated pest management
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:15.940]  system and go the organic route, I can fully endorse a company called Arbico Organics.
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:18.940]  It's A-R-B-I-C-O Organics.
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:22.940]  They are available online at arbico-organics.com.
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:23.940]  They do not pay me.
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:29.940]  I am not sponsored by them, but this one simple catalog, this is the early spring 2017 catalog.
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:36.940]  It includes beneficial insects and mites to combat almost any problem I can imagine in
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:37.940]  a garden.
[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:38.940]  There are mite predators.
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:39.940]  There are whitefly parasites.
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:41.940]  There are aphid parasites.
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:46.940]  You can buy anything from ladybugs and praying mantises to minute pirate bugs to assassin
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:51.940]  bugs, which we will talk about in the IPM episode, which I do have coming up for you.
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:55.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, my point here is that I do completely endorse Arbico Organics because
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:42:00.940]  another way that you can pay attention and notice bugs before they become a problem is
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:01.940]  yellow and blue sticky traps.
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:02.940]  I said blue also.
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:03.940]  Yes.
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.940]  Most people know about the yellow sticky traps for your garden.
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:08.940]  Let me talk about yellow sticky traps for a second.
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:12.940]  The reason yellow sticky traps are yellow is because bugs are attracted to the yellowing
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:13.940]  leaves.
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:14.940]  The yellowing leaves are a sign of weakness.
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:16.940]  Imagine you were a bug.
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:17.940]  You want to eat through the leaf.
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:21.940]  That thick green leaf is crunchy and it has protection on it.
[01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:25.940]  It's going to take a little more work to get to the crunchy, juicy, or that juicy, tasty
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:26.940]  insides.
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.940]  If the leaf is already yellow, it's a little bit weak and you can get your little fangs
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:32.940]  right through it and get in there and suck out the juices and get what you need.
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:36.940]  So bugs are programmed to want to head for those yellow leaves.
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:38.940]  So hang those yellow sticky traps up.
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:41.940]  I like to put one kind of low near the bottom of the canopy.
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:44.940]  I like to put one kind of in the middle of the canopy and then I put them up high where
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:46.940]  flying bugs are going to go up near the lights.
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:51.940]  So I like to have those yellow sticky traps around to let me know if bugs are there.
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:54.940]  And then if I see insects gathering on those, a couple is fine.
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:56.940]  You're going to see a couple occasionally because shit flies around.
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:58.940]  You're just going to have a normal bug flying around.
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:02.940]  But if you start seeing them gather on there, it's time to treat for whatever bug you see
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:03.940]  gathering on there.
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:06.940]  It's probably going to be a fungus gnat if it's something flying.
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:08.940]  The blue ones, put those lower.
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:11.940]  The blue sticky cards, put those lower near your soil and they will let you know if you
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:12.940]  are getting thrips.
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:17.940]  They are a good indicator of leaf miners and thrips and other soil bound insects.
[01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:22.940]  So the sticky traps are certainly a good way to let you know that insects are coming.
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:27.940]  Also, another good way to know that you've got bugs, flying bugs will stick to your lights.
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:29.940]  The light reflectors, they heat up.
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:32.940]  If you've got glass on there, that'll heat up.
[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.940]  Somewhere there will be bugs stuck to that.
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:35.940]  Pay attention to that.
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:39.940]  If you see little black bugs or little white bugs, that means you've got fungus gnats or
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:41.940]  white flies that you have got to treat for.
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:45.940]  So those are really simple ways and indicators that you have got problems and very simple
[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.940]  ways to prevent problems.
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:54.940]  Now, it's time to work our way into talking about preventing and eradicating and identifying
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:55.940]  more garden issues.
[01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:57.940]  Let's start today with white flies.
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:02.940]  White flies are more ugly than anything, but what white flies do is they make your plants
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:03.940]  weak.
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:05.940]  They will slow down the growth of your plant.
[01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:07.940]  They will make your plants weak and tired.
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:09.940]  They will certainly diminish your yield.
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:12.940]  They will diminish the quality of your plants.
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:16.940]  White flies like to stick their little teeth into your plants and suck the sap out of your
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:19.940]  plants, and then they fly around, then they land back on your plants, and they shit all
[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:22.940]  over your plants and leave little honeydew streaks on your plants.
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:26.940]  So they make your plants weak, and then when you try to take photos, your photos are fucking
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:29.940]  ugly because you've got white flies in there, you've got white fly shit in there.
[01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:30.940]  It's really frustrating.
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:33.940]  So let's talk about white flies.
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:35.940]  It sounds really easy to identify a white fly.
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:37.940]  White fly identification.
[01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:39.940]  They are little white bugs that fly around.
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:40.940]  How do you know they're there?
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:41.940]  They're flying around.
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:44.940]  If you don't see them, the best way to check for them, shake the plant.
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:48.940]  When you shake the plant, shake the foliage, white flies will take off flying.
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:50.940]  Like I said earlier, look around the light.
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:53.940]  Shake the plants and look toward the light because the little bugs want to fly right
[01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:57.940]  at the light when you shake them, and then they'll just fly around for a couple of seconds
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:59.940]  and they'll land right back on your plants.
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:00.940]  They're really frustrating.
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:02.940]  So that's an easy way to identify them.
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:10.940]  A good way to prevent white flies is a clean, dry, sealed grow room and also low temperatures.
[01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:15.940]  You guys, white flies thrive and reproduce in temperatures over 80 degrees.
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:19.940]  So try to keep it closer to 75, 77 degrees in there.
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:22.940]  That will slow down the white fly production if they do get in there.
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:26.940]  Also, like I was talking about earlier, clear out all of the plant debris that you have
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:27.940]  in your room.
[01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:28.940]  Don't have that stuff in there.
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:29.940]  Dead leaves and stuff.
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:30.940]  Get rid of that.
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:35.940]  Also, in the last episode, I talked about using fine dust filters and HEPA filters on
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:38.940]  all of your ducting or on your intakes or on your outs.
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:43.940]  Make sure you have some sort of ducting on all your ins and outs and make sure that all
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:46.940]  of your vents are covered so that the white flies can't travel through there.
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:47.940]  So that's a great way.
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:49.940]  Those are great ways to prevent white flies.
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:52.940]  So now you know how to spot them and you know how to prevent them.
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:53.940]  Now, should you get them?
[01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:56.940]  Let's talk about ways to get rid of white flies.
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:01.940]  Like I talked about a little bit ago, yellow sticky traps are a great way to start catching
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:05.940]  the white flies, but you're only going to get a small portion of what's there.
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:07.940]  Just the ones that fly to the yellow sticky traps.
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:08.940]  Just the dumb ones.
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.940]  The dumb ones are going to fly right to it.
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:12.940]  The smart ones are going to stay there and they're going to keep breeding.
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:16.940]  Another way that you can get rid of them is to shake the plants and when they fly up,
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:18.940]  simply use your shop vac.
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:19.940]  I've done this before in gardens.
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.940]  I've done this in personal gardens.
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.940]  I have done this also in commercial gardens.
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:25.940]  Just shake the shit out of them.
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:30.940]  Shake the plant and just use the wand on the shop vac and as they fly out, just suck them up.
[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:33.940]  They're going to fly right out of the plant and then they're going to fly right up to the light.
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:35.940]  So maybe keep the shop vac up toward the light.
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:36.940]  Just shop vac.
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:38.940]  Just suck them right up.
[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:39.940]  Shake the plant.
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:40.940]  Keep sucking.
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:41.940]  Chase them around.
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:44.940]  Suck them up until you're bored, until your arms go tired, or until they quit flying around.
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:45.940]  Do whichever one you got to do.
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:50.940]  So get out the shop vac and shop vac the shit out of those white flies.
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:52.940]  Also, things you can do.
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:53.940]  You can apply sprays.
[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:57.940]  You can use neem oil would work to help you get rid of your white flies.
[01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:00.940]  Pyrethrum sprays will help you get rid of your white flies.
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:04.940]  And spinosad sprays will help you get rid of your white flies.
[01:47:04.940 --> 01:47:06.940]  Those are all things that are up to you.
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:10.940]  If you want to use the evergreen pyrethrin spray, it seems to be a very versatile product.
[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:11.940]  You could spray the leaves.
[01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:15.940]  You can do a soil drench and that will get rid of most of your insects.
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:21.940]  I think two or three applications of the evergreen pyrethrums will get rid of most insects, to tell you the truth.
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:25.940]  But that is up to you if it's something you want to do.
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:31.940]  Also, if you've got a very small garden and a very light case of white flies, you can use insecticidal soap.
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:32.940]  There is safer soap.
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:34.940]  I think Ed Rosenthal makes his own type of soap.
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:38.940]  Simple products like that are great to use if you've got a light infestation.
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:44.940]  But also keep in mind, like I mention in every episode, everything you spray on your leaves is going to end up in your concentrates.
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:51.940]  So if you're going to apply essential oils or botanical extract oils, those are going to end up in your hash.
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:57.940]  If you plan on making hash, if you're making BHO, if you're making water hash, this stuff will end up in your concentrates.
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:58.940]  You're going to end up smoking it.
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:00.940]  You're going to end up tasting it.
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:03.940]  It may have a health effect.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:05.940]  I do not know what product you're using.
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:06.940]  I don't know the long-term effects of these.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:08.940]  Just keep that stuff in mind.
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:14.940]  Another thing that you can use to get rid of your white flies is a beneficial fungi.
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:17.940]  I think it is pronounced buvaria bassiana.
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:18.940]  It's a beneficial fungus.
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:20.940]  It can be applied in several different ways.
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:21.940]  It's sold as a powder.
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:22.940]  It can be sprinkled onto soil.
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:24.940]  It can be mixed with water.
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:27.940]  However you get it, please follow the instructions.
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:28.940]  Wear a mask if you use it.
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:29.940]  Wear gloves.
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:30.940]  Wear goggles.
[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:32.940]  Please, you guys, this is a horticultural product.
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:35.940]  Please be very careful with this stuff.
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:36.940]  It is not a joke.
[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:42.940]  Okay, now is the time when we talk about the beneficial insects that you can use to get rid of your white flies.
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:46.940]  If you do not want to apply pesticides, if you do not want to get out the shop vac,
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:48.940]  you guys, get out the shop vac and just suck the shit out of them.
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:49.940]  It won't hurt anything.
[01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:50.940]  Beat the shit out of your plants.
[01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:51.940]  It's kind of good for them.
[01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:54.940]  If you don't want to apply pesticides, if you don't want to use beneficial funguses,
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:56.940]  if you don't want to put spinosad on your plants,
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:01.940]  one thing you really can do is get white fly parasites.
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:07.940]  There are one, two, three different types of white fly parasites available in the Arbico magazine,
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:09.940]  and they are all very affordable.
[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:14.940]  The white fly parasite I would recommend to you is called the Ancarsia formosa.
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:20.940]  They're actually little wasps that fly around your greenhouse and eat the shit out of white flies.
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:24.940]  All right, you guys, that is my quick talk on how to get rid of white flies.
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:27.940]  Honestly, the best way to get rid of white flies is to prevent them.
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:29.940]  Keep your clothes clean if you've been to another grow.
[01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:31.940]  Keep your grow room sealed up.
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:35.940]  Keep your yellow sticky traps hung up, and hopefully the little fuckers don't get in your grow.
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:42.940]  You guys, one thing I should mention, a common way that I have discovered pests in gardens is through photography.
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:45.940]  I am a huge cannabis photography enthusiast.
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:50.940]  A shameless plug, if you'd like to follow my Instagram, I am ireee underscore genetics on Instagram.
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:55.940]  I-R-I-E underscore G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S.
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:56.940]  Ireee genetics on Instagram.
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:58.940]  I post a ton of cannabis photography.
[01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:02.940]  Some of my recent posts have gotten nearly 500 likes so far.
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:05.940]  I'm at 480-something likes on a couple of posts.
[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:06.940]  If you want to check that out, go for it.
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:11.940]  Photography is how I discover a lot of issues and problems.
[01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:13.940]  I'll snap a picture at a grow.
[01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:14.940]  I'll zoom in real far.
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:15.940]  I'll snap a picture.
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:16.940]  I'll come home.
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:17.940]  I'll throw the disc in the computer.
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:21.940]  I'll open it up on the computer screen and zoom in, thinking that I've got the most amazing shot.
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:30.940]  Then I'll notice that there are some white flies or some fungus gnats or some aphids just crunched up in a corner on one of these buds that I did not even notice.
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:33.940]  It ruined my photo, but at least now I know that there's a problem.
[01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:36.940]  There's something I need to treat for, something I need to take care of.
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:41.940]  If you've got a good camera, if you've got a decent camera, you could probably do this with your iPhone or Android camera.
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:44.940]  If you suspect you've got a problem, take some pictures.
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:45.940]  Zoom in.
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:50.940]  Look at the pictures when you zoom in, and you may reveal some problems you were unaware of.
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:51.940]  All right, you guys.
[01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:53.940]  I've been going for 17 minutes here, it looks like.
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.940]  I'm going to press pause for a second.
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:56.940]  I'm going to take a drink.
[01:50:56.940 --> 01:51:01.940]  You know I'm going to take a couple of giant dabs, and then I will be right back, and we are going to talk about aphids.
[01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:50.380]  All right, Podcast World.
[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:52.380]  I am back, and I am heavily medicated.
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:54.380]  I hope you enjoyed the music we were listening to during the break.
[01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:58.380]  The song I played was called Fat Spliffs by a band called Slightly Stupid.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:03.380]  I'm sure a lot of my reggae friends are familiar with Slightly Stupid, but if you haven't heard of them, check them out.
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:05.380]  I'm sure you will dig them.
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:11.380]  During the break, you guys, I took some gigantic dabs of some Distillate, and I am heavily medicated.
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:13.380]  I like to talk about how much I enjoy Shatter.
[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:14.380]  I do like Shatter.
[01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:19.380]  Shatter is probably the most cost-effective way for me to medicate the way I prefer.
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.380]  I like to smoke frequently.
[01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:22.380]  I like to take large dabs.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:28.380]  I feel like I get more medicinal effect off of one giant dab than I would three little dabs.
[01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:36.380]  If you took the same amount of hash, if you took, let's just say, a half gram, I would smoke a half gram dab by itself instead of breaking it into three small dabs.
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:48.380]  And I feel like if I smoked those three small dabs back to back, like inhale, blow it out, heat the rig up again, do it again, blow out the dab, heat the rig up again, smoke it in, blow it out, do it again,
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:54.380]  I think those three dabs back to back would not get me as high as one single half gram dab would do.
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:53:02.380]  So if I took the same half gram, broke it down into three pieces, took them all, or took one giant dab, I'd get way better medication off of the half gram.
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:05.380]  So I like to take giant dabs, and I like to do it frequently.
[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:08.380]  I like to take two or three dabs at a time when I take a dab break.
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:10.380]  Sometimes I'll take four or five dabs at a time.
[01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:15.380]  So Shatter is the most cost-effective way for me to get the medicine I need for the price.
[01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:17.380]  I like to take big dabs very frequently.
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:23.380]  But when I need a little extra, when I just want to do something extra to my head, you guys, this Distillate is the way to go.
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.380]  It's a little bit expensive, so you can't get down on it.
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:27.380]  You can't spoil yourself every day.
[01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:33.380]  But if you're trying to spend a little extra money at the dispensary, I highly recommend a nice glass vial of Distillate.
[01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:35.380]  And what I like to do, I heat up the banger.
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:40.380]  I heat the banger a little bit too hot, or the nail, whichever you're using, or the e-nail.
[01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:41.380]  The e-nail's already on.
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:43.380]  Get it to a little bit hot, and then let it cool.
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:49.380]  And then I just take the torch and just barely heat the tip of the glass syringe which the Distillate comes in.
[01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:52.380]  And then you just barely tap the plunger, and it'll just push.
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:56.380]  I think three drops of Distillate is a good dab for me.
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:59.380]  Sometimes I like to go four or five if I'm trying to go crazy.
[01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:03.380]  If you want to go big, go like seven or eight or ten drops of the Distillate into the banger and do it.
[01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:07.380]  But I think one or two drops, two or three drops, would get most people choking and nice and high.
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:09.380]  So big shout-out to Distillate.
[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:11.380]  I'm really starting to fall in love with Distillate.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:16.380]  Hey, guys, I'm going to quit rambling about Distillate and concentrates, and we're going to talk about aphids.
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:19.380]  Aphids are very common in cannabis grows.
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:21.380]  They love warm environments and warm conditions.
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:23.380]  That's why you find them in a lot of ganja grows.
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:25.380]  That's why you find them in a lot of greenhouses.
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:28.380]  So let's talk about identifying aphids.
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:33.380]  Aphids are about the size of a piece of rice, I think, maybe a little bit smaller.
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:35.380]  I've seen aphids plenty of times.
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:38.380]  They look like a piece of rice, maybe just a little bit smaller.
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:40.380]  They're pear-shaped.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:43.380]  Aphids come in many different colors.
[01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:44.380]  I have seen aphids.
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:45.380]  I've seen white aphids.
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:47.380]  I've seen orange aphids.
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:48.380]  I've seen green aphids.
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:53.380]  I've seen aphids that are a reddish-brown color, almost the color of blood.
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:56.380]  Aphids come in many different colors.
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:59.380]  Aphids like to hang out on the bottom sides of your leaves.
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:04.380]  They like to congregate at the bottom sides of the leaves, usually kind of where they've got some protection,
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:07.380]  where they can hide from predators and light and you and the wind.
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:16.380]  I've also seen aphids right where the bud, at the top bud, where the leaves come out of the bud and kind of make like a bowl.
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:19.380]  The leaves were coming out of the bud and curling up because the bud was really happy.
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:23.380]  And right in that little chilling area where the leaves and bud made contact,
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:26.380]  there was a nice little colony of aphids just chilling and living right there.
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:31.380]  I don't know how long they'd been there, but they were there for a long time because there were a bunch of them.
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:35.380]  So aphids like to hang out in a lot of different places in the plant.
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:39.380]  So make sure you check often and they also breed very quickly.
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:42.380]  So make sure you're paying attention for aphids also.
[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:46.380]  Aphids, the problem with aphids is they are leaf suckers.
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:51.380]  They like to bite into your leaf and suck out the juices, just like all the other damn pests for your gardens.
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:54.380]  So they get up under the leaves, they poke little holes in there,
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:57.380]  they start sucking out the leaf juices and all the life out of your plants.
[01:55:57.380 --> 01:55:59.380]  Your plants start looking like shit.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:02.380]  Now your plants are getting weak and they're susceptible to other problems.
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:06.380]  They're also going to yield less. They're going to grow slowly.
[01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:08.380]  They're going to look like shit.
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:10.380]  A lot of times if an aphid problem gets out of control,
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:14.380]  you'll start seeing the leaves start to curl and wilt and look like they're dead.
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:15.380]  They're just giving up.
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:18.380]  Those plants have been beat to shit and they've been chewed up by the aphids so bad
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:20.380]  that they're not even going to try to fight anymore.
[01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:23.380]  They're just going to curl up and die. Try again next year.
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:28.380]  All right, let's talk about how to prevent yourself from getting aphids in your ganja garden.
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:31.380]  Like most other pests, we can avoid getting them by having filtration,
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:36.380]  dust filters and HEPA filters on your intake and your outgoing vents.
[01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:39.380]  Also, you need a clean grow room.
[01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:42.380]  I keep talking about a clean grow room, but every leaf,
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:45.380]  every piece of debris is a place for a bug to hide.
[01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:48.380]  So also, something you can really think about for aphids,
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:51.380]  you need clean clothes and clean shoes.
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:54.380]  If you go on a hike, if you are around plants outside,
[01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:59.380]  if it is warm, please change your clothes before you go into your garden.
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:03.380]  I worked in a commercial grow. Everything was clean.
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:07.380]  One of my coworkers talked about taking their dog for a hike.
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:11.380]  They posted pictures on Instagram all about taking their dog for a hike.
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:17.380]  They stopped by the grow to say hello and see if we wanted lunch on their way home.
[01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:20.380]  Three days later, that garden had aphids.
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:24.380]  I don't want to blame that dog for running through a bush,
[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:27.380]  getting in the car, putting aphids on my friend,
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:29.380]  my friend coming to the grow and putting aphids in my garden,
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:33.380]  but honestly, you can tell in my heart that that's what I think fucking happened.
[01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:36.380]  So please do not go to a grow after you've been out hiking.
[01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:39.380]  Do not come to a grow after you've been playing with your dog.
[01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:43.380]  I think that pets are huge carriers of garden pests.
[01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:45.380]  They're out there running around in everything.
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:46.380]  They're low to the ground where the bugs are.
[01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:48.380]  They're playing in the dirt. They're playing in the bushes.
[01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:51.380]  That's where the garden pests are. They're rubbing up against plants.
[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:53.380]  Plants are where plant pests live.
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:55.380]  They're not going to bring home predatory mites.
[01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:57.380]  They're going to bring home spider mites.
[01:57:57.380 --> 01:57:59.380]  They're going to bring home thrips and aphids.
[01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:04.380]  So please be very careful with your clothing, your shoes, and your pests.
[01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:09.380]  Another good way to prevent aphids in your garden is to check for them.
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:11.380]  I mean, if they're already there, you're going to see them.
[01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:14.380]  A way to prevent an infestation is to check for them very frequently.
[01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:20.380]  That's the best way to check and prevent any type of pest infestation is to pay attention every day.
[01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:24.380]  One sign that you have got an aphid problem is ants.
[01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:28.380]  If you have got ants in your grow room, you have probably got aphids also.
[01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:32.380]  Ants and aphids often come together in your garden.
[01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:34.380]  So if you've got one, you've probably got the other.
[01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:37.380]  Ants are easy to get rid of. We'll talk about that in another episode.
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:38.380]  I'm actually going to write it down right now.
[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:41.380]  All right. I even wrote it down, so that will happen.
[01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:46.380]  Okay. Let's talk about ways to eradicate aphids should they show up in your garden.
[01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:48.380]  Of course, we talk about this quite frequently.
[01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:53.380]  The first step that you can do if you choose to is you can spray products on your garden.
[01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:56.380]  There are many things you can spray for aphids.
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:59.380]  We're going to talk about, of course, the obvious, neem oil.
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:02.380]  Neem oil will get rid of the aphids. They don't want to be there.
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:04.380]  It's sticky. It smells like shit. It tastes terrible.
[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:07.380]  The aphids don't want to hang out on that.
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:10.380]  A couple of applications of neem oil should get rid of your aphids.
[01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:15.380]  However, if you're in flower, you do not want to spray neem oil on flowering plants.
[01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:21.380]  Keep in mind, I say it all the time, everything you spray on your buds and your leaves is going to end up in your concentrate.
[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:25.380]  If you've got big, fat, swollen buds, they're going to act like a sponge.
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:29.380]  You're going to spray neem oil on there, and it's going to absorb and hang onto a bunch of neem.
[01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:33.380]  You're going to concentrate it, and you'll actually see the neem oil float on the top of your hash.
[01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:35.380]  You may have to think about what you're going to do.
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:39.380]  If you're going to make a lot of concentrates, these sprays may not be for you.
[01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:44.380]  If you do choose to use sprays, pyrethrum sprays work well to get rid of aphids.
[01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:48.380]  I, of course, have been endorsing the Evergreen brand. It's very affordable.
[01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:52.380]  There's another brand that's quite expensive. It's the same thing as Evergreen.
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:54.380]  You can use cinnamon oil. You can use clove oils.
[01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:58.380]  You can use a product made by Ed Rosenthal called Zero Tolerance.
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:01.380]  All of these products will help you to get rid of your aphids.
[02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:05.380]  It's up to you to choose how strongly you want to attack these pests
[02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:10.380]  and also how harsh of a chemical you want to apply to the plants that you are loving
[02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:15.380]  and that you are growing to use as medicine for yourself or other people that you care for.
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:23.380]  Another method we can use to get rid of our aphids is a beneficial fungus called Boveria bassiana,
[02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:33.380]  which is actually sold as a product called Botanagard 22WP, and it's spelled B-O-T-N-I-G-A-R-D,
[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:37.380]  and it's 22WP. It's a little bit expensive, but it will certainly work.
[02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:44.380]  This is the beneficial fungus I keep speaking of that can be applied to treat a plethora of garden insects.
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:48.380]  You guys, you can find it, of course, at rbco-organics.com.
[02:00:48.380 --> 02:00:52.380]  I did not realize it would be for sale on that website. I was not looking for it on that website.
[02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:56.380]  I did a quick Google search to see where we could purchase it so I could share it with you,
[02:00:56.380 --> 02:00:59.380]  and the first place that came up was RBCo Organics.
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:05.380]  I'm sure they will not sponsor me because I'm a cannabis podcast, but let them know if you do shop with them.
[02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:09.380]  Let them know that you heard about them through the Grow From Your Heart podcast, through Ross DeJeff.
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:13.380]  Now, we've talked about how to get rid of these aphids on your plants if you don't have giant buds.
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:18.380]  If you are in flower and you've got giant buds, I would never recommend spraying products on there.
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:23.380]  You don't want to spray something that's going to leave a flavor or possibly cause some sort of long-lasting health effect
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:26.380]  that we don't even know about for years to come.
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:29.380]  If you don't want to spray the plants, what's the next option?
[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:32.380]  It is time to bring out the predator bugs.
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:38.380]  You guys, this is where ladybugs are useful. Ladybugs do love to eat the shit out of aphids.
[02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:43.380]  There's actually a really cool picture in Ed Rosenthal's book of a ladybug just devouring an aphid.
[02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:48.380]  This is where the ladybugs do come in. Ladybugs are actually useful for getting rid of your aphids.
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:54.380]  Also, the praying mantis I discredited earlier, he is actually really good at getting rid of aphids.
[02:01:55.380 --> 02:02:00.380]  The ladybugs, the praying mantis, those would be the first steps to getting rid of aphids in your cannabis garden.
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:03.380]  Then you can bring out aphid parasites and aphid predators.
[02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:08.380]  There are several available. The Phidias colomani is a well-known aphid parasite.
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:13.380]  There are several aphid predators available. Some of them prefer certain conditions.
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:19.380]  If you're going to work with the predators and the parasites, make sure that you've got the proper and appropriate conditions
[02:02:19.380 --> 02:02:24.380]  for these insects so that they can thrive and destroy your aphids.
[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:29.380]  Another thing you can do that is completely free and completely organic, it's safe and simple,
[02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:33.380]  you can simply remove leaves or you can remove buds that are infested with bugs.
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:40.380]  It is not a big deal. Chop it off, put it in a trash bag, seal the trash bag, put that in a sealed trash can away from the grow,
[02:02:40.380 --> 02:02:45.380]  and you will have manually eliminated the problem from your grow.
[02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:50.380]  Another thing I want to mention that I forgot to write down, but I just thought of it as I was talking,
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:56.380]  oftentimes I have seen aphids on the stems of cannabis plants moving up and down, just traveling around the plant.
[02:02:56.380 --> 02:03:04.380]  A product called stylet oil will coat the stems of the plants and it will leave it like an undesirable place for these aphids to be.
[02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:09.380]  Check out a product called stylet oil, dilute it heavily, apply it to your plants,
[02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:16.380]  and that will keep away most of your garden pests, especially these aphids and also the whiteflies.
[02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:24.380]  Alright, cannabis community, I want to thank you for listening to part two of preventing, identifying, and eradicating common garden pests and issues.
[02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:29.380]  So far we've only covered insects, but once we cover the majority of the cannabis pest insects,
[02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:35.380]  we are going to work our way into identifying other problems in the garden, such as plants that are too dry and too wet.
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:41.380]  I'll teach you how to identify overfed and underfed plants. We'll talk about calcium and magnesium deficiencies.
[02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:46.380]  I've got a lot of things planned for you. I hope you subscribe and stick around for all of those episodes.
[02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:50.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the part of the podcast where I remind you about Patreon.
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:59.380]  If you would like to make a financial contribution to the podcast, please visit patreon.com slash grow from your heart for all of the information.
[02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:04.380]  Let me tell you what I'm going to do with your contribution if you do choose to contribute to Patreon.
[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:11.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, it does cost me a small portion of money to host my website, iRegeneticsColorado.com, which is where I host this podcast.
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:18.380]  I'm not trying to get rich. The people that contribute to Patreon, their contributions will be used to pay for my web hosting.
[02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:21.380]  That's all I'm trying to pay for. So if you're able to do that, I appreciate it.
[02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:26.380]  If you cannot contribute, please do not feel like I am leaving you out, like I'm abandoning you.
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:33.380]  I love you. I want you to listen. I am simply creating the option for people to contribute if they are able to and choose to do so.
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:37.380]  I want to give a big shout out to the people who have contributed to Patreon.
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:44.380]  Somebody threw down $10 the other day. I'm not sure if they want their name said on the show, but big shout out. It's hugely appreciated.
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:47.380]  All right, you guys, I need to give a huge shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:53.380]  If you need some t-shirts made, if you need hoodies printed, if you need hat pins made, my friends at Handmade Apparel can take great care of you.
[02:04:53.380 --> 02:05:00.380]  Make sure you visit handmadeapparel.biz and let them know Rasta Jeff from the Grow From Your Heart podcast sent you.
[02:05:00.380 --> 02:05:03.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for listening to another episode. That's all I've got for you this week.
[02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:06.380]  I want to give a big shout out to Skinny and your mom, Cindy.
[02:05:06.380 --> 02:05:10.380]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
