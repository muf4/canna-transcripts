[00:02.430 --> 00:26.250]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:26.250 --> 00:28.650]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:28.650 --> 00:34.050]  This is episode 717 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:34.050 --> 00:37.470]  In this episode, I'm going to catch up on a couple of listener emails.
[00:37.470 --> 00:40.970]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:40.970 --> 00:45.210]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:45.210 --> 00:47.730]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[00:57.470 --> 01:00.670]  send a thank you shout out to Dank Grows and Justa Smokin.

[01:12.850 --> 01:14.770]  friend, my buddy Dave's Not Here.
[01:14.770 --> 01:17.710]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:17.710 --> 01:18.710]  Thank you.
[01:18.710 --> 01:21.250]  Shout out to the Red Eyed Optimist.
[01:21.250 --> 01:26.310]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:26.310 --> 01:30.010]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:30.010 --> 01:36.170]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:36.170 --> 01:39.050]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:39.050 --> 01:43.050]  You know I do include that link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:43.050 --> 01:46.890]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:46.890 --> 01:50.150]  Once again, you guys, truly big thanks for the continued Patreon support.
[01:50.150 --> 01:54.190]  The past couple of months have been record setters and it has been great.
[01:54.190 --> 01:57.010]  Thank you once again for all of that.
[01:57.010 --> 02:00.090]  Once again, I want to do send a big shout out to my friend Terp Gooney.
[02:00.090 --> 02:01.970]  I gave him a shout out on the Instagram live show.
[02:01.970 --> 02:06.110]  I've mentioned him on a couple of platforms, but I want to do it right here on the podcast.
[02:06.250 --> 02:08.350]  Big shout out to my buddy Terp Gooney.
[02:08.350 --> 02:12.990]  That's right, Terp Gooney got himself an Irie Army tattoo and it looks fantastic.
[02:12.990 --> 02:15.110]  I'll try to include a picture of it here in the show.
[02:15.110 --> 02:17.470]  I should get permission from him before doing so.
[02:17.470 --> 02:21.150]  If he granted permission, there will be a photo of an Irie Army tattoo that I think
[02:21.150 --> 02:22.150]  looks impressive.
[02:22.150 --> 02:28.070]  Terp Gooney is the third person that I am aware of to get an Irie Genetics or Irie Army
[02:28.070 --> 02:29.950]  tattoo that is impressive.
[02:29.950 --> 02:30.950]  That's amazing.
[02:30.950 --> 02:38.990]  I've created a brand, a community, a product, all of the above, a service, a vibe that people
[02:38.990 --> 02:40.790]  would like to tattoo on their bodies.
[02:40.790 --> 02:42.070]  That shit's there forever, dude.
[02:42.070 --> 02:44.910]  You can't forget and just scrape that off one day and change your mind.
[02:44.910 --> 02:45.910]  That shit is there.
[02:45.910 --> 02:48.070]  It's red, yellow, and green on people's bodies.
[02:48.070 --> 02:49.070]  That's amazing to me.
[02:49.070 --> 02:53.990]  Big shout out to my friends who show mad support and mad love by getting my brand tattooed
[02:53.990 --> 02:54.990]  on themselves.
[02:54.990 --> 02:55.990]  That's amazing to me.
[02:55.990 --> 02:56.990]  It honestly blows my mind.
[02:56.990 --> 02:59.710]  It makes me rambling and speechless because what the fuck do you even say when somebody
[02:59.710 --> 03:02.350]  tattoos your brand on them?
[03:02.350 --> 03:03.350]  Maybe you'll feel it one day.
[03:03.350 --> 03:05.190]  I hope you get to feel that sort of vibe one day.
[03:05.190 --> 03:07.110]  But I want to send a shout out to Terp Gooney.
[03:07.110 --> 03:10.390]  Also, I owe a shout out to OG Purple Thumb.
[03:10.390 --> 03:13.230]  Perp tattooed an Irie tattoo on himself.
[03:13.230 --> 03:15.990]  He did it to himself and it looks good.
[03:15.990 --> 03:17.270]  Big up to our buddy Perp.
[03:17.270 --> 03:20.990]  Also shout out to the captain and commander of the Irie Army.
[03:20.990 --> 03:25.430]  My buddy Lemur Priest has the OG Irie Genetics logo tattooed on himself.
[03:25.430 --> 03:27.150]  That is a bad motherfucker.
[03:27.150 --> 03:29.690]  Rumor has it Lemur is going to come hang out with me for a day.
[03:29.690 --> 03:32.530]  We're going to go check out Meow Wolf and have a good time.
[03:32.530 --> 03:33.810]  So I cannot wait for that.
[03:33.810 --> 03:36.770]  But you guys, people have Irie tattoos on their bodies.
[03:36.770 --> 03:37.770]  It blows my mind.
[03:37.770 --> 03:38.770]  That's tremendous.
[03:38.770 --> 03:39.770]  That's amazing.
[03:39.770 --> 03:40.890]  That is brand loyalty.
[03:40.890 --> 03:41.890]  That is friendship.
[03:41.890 --> 03:43.770]  That is community right there.
[03:43.770 --> 03:47.610]  I thought about sometimes getting band logos tattooed on me.
[03:47.610 --> 03:49.930]  For a long time I wanted a Grateful Dead stealing on me.
[03:49.930 --> 03:51.330]  Thought about the fish logo.
[03:51.330 --> 03:52.330]  Never did it.
[03:52.330 --> 03:53.930]  You guys got my logo tattooed on me.
[03:53.930 --> 03:55.410]  I don't even have it tattooed on me.
[03:55.410 --> 03:56.410]  So that's fucking awesome.
[03:56.410 --> 03:57.410]  Thank you guys.
[03:57.410 --> 03:58.590]  Here's where I'm headed.
[03:58.590 --> 04:04.310]  If you have an Irie Army, Irie Genetics tattoo on yourself and I don't know about it yet,
[04:04.310 --> 04:05.470]  please remind me.
[04:05.470 --> 04:06.470]  Send me an update.
[04:06.470 --> 04:10.030]  Let me know about that shit because I do and will send you gifts.
[04:10.030 --> 04:13.950]  If you've got my logo, my brand tatted on you and it's real, don't just go draw some
[04:13.950 --> 04:14.950]  shit so I send you a gift.
[04:14.950 --> 04:19.510]  You guys, I want to see a real tattoo and I can tell because this dude had red and blood
[04:19.510 --> 04:20.510]  and shit in his tattoo.
[04:20.510 --> 04:21.510]  It was real, bro.
[04:21.510 --> 04:24.310]  You could see that he showed me the stencil, the outline, and then the work and it was
[04:24.310 --> 04:25.310]  fucking awesome.
[04:25.310 --> 04:28.230]  You guys got real Irie tattoos, Irie Genetics tattoos.
[04:28.230 --> 04:30.990]  You can't just say stay Irie or be Irie on your butt or whatever.
[04:30.990 --> 04:34.910]  It's got to be Irie Genetics, Irie Army, Rasta Jeff, grow from your heart, something in that
[04:34.910 --> 04:35.910]  vein.
[04:35.910 --> 04:39.070]  If it's my brand, I will send you gifts, not just one gift.
[04:39.070 --> 04:42.870]  Sometimes I make new products and you may just randomly get a box with new shit in it.
[04:42.870 --> 04:44.670]  Ask our buddy Lemur, ask Purp randomly.
[04:44.670 --> 04:48.070]  They just get shit in the mail because they've got Irie Genetics tattoos.
[04:48.070 --> 04:49.070]  All right.
[04:49.070 --> 04:51.070]  I feel like I've talked for a long time about that.
[04:51.070 --> 04:52.590]  This podcast has been long already.
[04:52.590 --> 04:54.270]  We haven't covered a damn thing.
[04:54.270 --> 04:57.030]  Let me jump into the next topic that I do have written down.
[04:57.030 --> 04:58.070]  I do have a PSA.
[04:58.070 --> 05:00.470]  This is a public service announcement.
[05:00.470 --> 05:02.430]  This is a message from Rasta Jeff.
[05:02.430 --> 05:05.590]  One of those the more you know, except mine would say the more you grow, right?
[05:05.590 --> 05:06.590]  That's what I'm thinking here.
[05:06.590 --> 05:09.310]  Shout out to whatever I took dabs of also.
[05:09.310 --> 05:10.630]  It's got me in the right fucking zone.
[05:10.630 --> 05:13.070]  Shout out to whoever put a smile on my face for Valentine's Day.
[05:13.070 --> 05:15.310]  You know who you is, who you are.
[05:15.310 --> 05:17.510]  My PSA goes like this.
[05:17.510 --> 05:24.230]  You guys, a lot of times I get messages and emails from people who have a really cool
[05:24.230 --> 05:26.130]  company name, which is cool.
[05:26.130 --> 05:31.230]  If your company name is like Uncle Jim's fucking big weed farm, that's cool.
[05:31.230 --> 05:32.230]  Stoner Bob's.
[05:32.230 --> 05:33.230]  I almost said Stoner Dave.
[05:33.230 --> 05:34.230]  I've got a friend named Stoner Dave.
[05:34.230 --> 05:35.230]  I'm not singling you out.
[05:35.230 --> 05:36.750]  You don't use Stoner Dave as your business name.
[05:36.750 --> 05:37.750]  That's your name.
[05:37.750 --> 05:40.950]  But Stoner Dave's Pot Farm is a really cool name.
[05:40.950 --> 05:41.950]  I know what you do.
[05:41.950 --> 05:43.230]  I know who you are.
[05:43.350 --> 05:48.870]  If we do business, I might have to mail you a package to Stoner Dave's Pot Farm.
[05:48.870 --> 05:49.990]  I don't like that shit at all.
[05:49.990 --> 05:54.950]  You guys, when you're naming your company, let's think about stuff like that.
[05:54.950 --> 05:57.990]  You're going to have to have packages mailed to you.
[05:57.990 --> 06:02.630]  I don't like putting Stoner Dave's Pot Farm in my shipping app when I mail things to people.
[06:02.630 --> 06:06.510]  If it's a t-shirt or a pack of seeds, I don't like it.
[06:06.510 --> 06:10.070]  The kid at the post office, the old lady at the post office, the old man, the transgender
[06:10.070 --> 06:14.630]  person working at the post office that is ageless or sexless, got to be careful nowadays,
[06:14.630 --> 06:18.350]  that person may see that package that says Stoner Dave's Pot Farm.
[06:18.350 --> 06:20.430]  They're like, well, I want to know what the fuck is in there.
[06:20.430 --> 06:24.710]  And they may, they have the ability, the option, the opportunity to be a shady fuck and open
[06:24.710 --> 06:25.710]  it up.
[06:25.710 --> 06:28.150]  They may have just stolen your t-shirt, your seeds, or both.
[06:28.150 --> 06:30.370]  And I don't want that to happen.
[06:30.370 --> 06:34.150]  So just a public service announcement from a guy who's been doing business for a long
[06:34.150 --> 06:39.150]  time, who's got maybe more steps ahead of you in business, maybe just some ideas.
[06:39.230 --> 06:40.430]  It's just my opinion.
[06:40.430 --> 06:43.530]  Let's be more careful about naming our companies.
[06:43.530 --> 06:48.470]  You can name your company Stoner Dave's Pot Farm, but you can also have an LLC or a doing
[06:48.470 --> 06:54.430]  business as name that I can mail shit to and talk about more openly in my business affairs
[06:54.430 --> 06:57.310]  that it's not obvious that we're just doing weed business.
[06:57.310 --> 07:01.230]  I know that Stoner Dave's Pot Farm is a cool name, but it doesn't look good on shipping.
[07:01.230 --> 07:03.030]  It doesn't look good on invoices.
[07:03.030 --> 07:04.950]  And it definitely, here's the other thing I want to talk about.
[07:04.950 --> 07:07.870]  If you start a business, you've got to pay taxes.
[07:07.910 --> 07:11.550]  Do you really want to send something to the IRS, the government, the state, and the city
[07:11.550 --> 07:15.710]  with Stoner Dave's Pot Farm written on it, unless it's a cultivation or a dispensary?
[07:15.710 --> 07:17.590]  Those are the only things I'd really do that to.
[07:17.590 --> 07:21.270]  And still, I don't name those obvious fucking pothead things.
[07:21.270 --> 07:23.750]  I try to stay a little bit businessy professional.
[07:23.750 --> 07:25.910]  But naming your company is very important.
[07:25.910 --> 07:28.110]  I have to put the name of your company on an invoice.
[07:28.110 --> 07:29.750]  I have to put it on a package.
[07:29.750 --> 07:31.350]  It goes on a tax report.
[07:31.350 --> 07:35.350]  So that stuff, I'm dealing with right now because I'm mailing a package to somebody
[07:35.430 --> 07:38.110]  who I'm like, really, bro, is that really the name you want me to put on that package?
[07:38.110 --> 07:38.790]  I'm not going to do that.
[07:38.790 --> 07:41.390]  You're going to get initials is what you're going to get on your package.
[07:41.390 --> 07:44.510]  So just the idea, you're basically dry snitching on yourself.
[07:44.510 --> 07:52.030]  If you put fucking Dankweed LLC and you live in an apartment building, that may ring some bells.
[07:52.030 --> 07:54.150]  That may get your apartment building checked out.
[07:54.150 --> 07:54.630]  You know what I'm saying?
[07:54.630 --> 07:56.110]  So just be smarter with the names.
[07:56.110 --> 07:57.350]  You're dry snitching on yourself.
[07:57.350 --> 07:58.430]  Be careful.
[07:58.430 --> 07:59.230]  Be serious.
[07:59.230 --> 08:01.830]  Also, I'm mailing this shit to your house.
[08:01.830 --> 08:03.030]  It's coming to your front door.
[08:03.030 --> 08:04.270]  It has passed a bunch of hands.
[08:04.270 --> 08:08.070]  It have all read Stoner Dave's Pot Farm at this address.
[08:08.070 --> 08:09.550]  And I know exactly where that is.
[08:09.550 --> 08:12.710]  I'm putting your address, your name, and then possibly taxes on it.
[08:12.710 --> 08:14.030]  I've rambled on enough about that.
[08:14.030 --> 08:16.230]  I think you get the point, you guys.
[08:16.230 --> 08:18.470]  It's cool to have a business, but let's kind of...
[08:18.470 --> 08:24.110]  And it's cool to get shit shipped to you, but let's separate our Instagram fame from our business name.
[08:24.110 --> 08:25.550]  My company is iReGenetics.
[08:25.550 --> 08:26.750]  I make iReGenetic seeds.
[08:26.750 --> 08:28.550]  I do not use that as my...
[08:28.550 --> 08:30.670]  That's a doing business as name.
[08:30.670 --> 08:31.750]  That's not what we're listed as.
[08:31.750 --> 08:33.270]  That's not what the business names are.
[08:33.270 --> 08:35.950]  There are umbrellas to keep that stuff a little bit more careful.
[08:35.950 --> 08:36.670]  Be careful, you guys.
[08:36.670 --> 08:40.110]  It is a fun revolution, a fun evolution that we're coming from.
[08:40.110 --> 08:45.710]  The black market, the dark ages too, the free market, the green age, the revolution, the evolution of cannabis is great.
[08:45.710 --> 08:47.270]  But don't get ahead of yourself.
[08:47.270 --> 08:49.350]  Don't get overzealous.
[08:49.350 --> 08:53.630]  Don't create a name that's going to get you noticed in the wrong way by the wrong people.
[08:53.630 --> 08:58.070]  And if you are doing business, if you're creating an LLC or whatever, be careful with those taxes.
[08:58.070 --> 09:00.870]  Get your tax person, your lawyer, your account people.
[09:00.870 --> 09:06.790]  Get all those people in line so you can do shit correctly, especially if you're going to name your shit Stoner Dave's Pot Farm.
[09:06.790 --> 09:10.470]  If Stoner Dave's Pot Farm doesn't pay their taxes, I cannot wait to come check you out.
[09:10.470 --> 09:12.270]  That's just fucking begging for stuff.
[09:12.270 --> 09:13.550]  So be careful, you guys.
[09:13.550 --> 09:15.910]  That is my public stoner announcement.
[09:15.910 --> 09:17.630]  Check yourself when you're naming your stuff.
[09:17.630 --> 09:18.950]  Instagram, it is cool.
[09:18.950 --> 09:22.670]  Be fucking Stoner Dave's Ganja Farm that grows the best weed and smokes nine pounds a day.
[09:22.670 --> 09:24.510]  That's a cool fucking name on Instagram.
[09:24.510 --> 09:26.070]  I don't want to put that in my shipping app.
[09:26.070 --> 09:27.790]  I don't want to make an invoice with that.
[09:27.790 --> 09:29.710]  Don't want to turn that into the tax people.
[09:29.710 --> 09:30.790]  Don't even want to fuck with that.
[09:30.790 --> 09:33.030]  So be a little bit, let's step out of that.
[09:33.030 --> 09:34.510]  And I'm I read genetics.
[09:34.510 --> 09:35.110]  You guys are paying.
[09:35.110 --> 09:36.030]  I read you're not paying.
[09:36.030 --> 09:36.710]  I read genetics.
[09:36.710 --> 09:38.390]  It's not what shows up on anything when you pay.
[09:38.390 --> 09:40.030]  So let's just be more careful.
[09:40.030 --> 09:40.910]  That's all I'm getting at.
[09:40.910 --> 09:41.950]  Now let's move forward.
[09:41.950 --> 09:44.830]  I do have another not quite a public service announcement.
[09:44.830 --> 09:48.950]  This isn't this is an invitation slash advertising.
[09:48.950 --> 09:54.150]  Last year I did talk about the groovy gravy secret stash seed exchange event.
[09:54.150 --> 09:56.390]  Guess what, ladies and gentlemen, it is happening again.
[09:56.390 --> 09:57.310]  That's right.
[09:57.310 --> 10:00.630]  March 26th at an undisclosed location in Denver.
[10:00.670 --> 10:02.830]  It is an easy to access location.
[10:02.830 --> 10:03.550]  It's a cool place.
[10:03.550 --> 10:07.350]  We just have to be can't reveal the location yet for logistical purposes.
[10:07.350 --> 10:09.790]  However, it is a cool place.
[10:09.790 --> 10:12.070]  There will be a seed sales event.
[10:12.070 --> 10:12.590]  That's right.
[10:12.590 --> 10:16.670]  I read genetics and many other industry leading breeders will be at this event.
[10:16.670 --> 10:17.990]  Slang and beans.
[10:17.990 --> 10:21.110]  Come get some seeds, possibly have some t-shirts there, maybe some other merch,
[10:21.110 --> 10:22.750]  depending on what is still left in stock.
[10:22.750 --> 10:25.350]  We've been blowing out the store the past couple of months.
[10:25.350 --> 10:27.230]  Get some merch, get some beans.
[10:27.230 --> 10:30.030]  There will be seed breeders, food trucks.
[10:30.030 --> 10:33.310]  Rumor has it there may be live glass blowing that hasn't been confirmed.
[10:33.310 --> 10:35.990]  I think that was on the list of things that I read and heard about.
[10:35.990 --> 10:39.110]  But make sure you check out the groovy gravy secret stash on Instagram.
[10:39.110 --> 10:40.870]  Check out groovy gravy.
[10:40.870 --> 10:41.910]  Super cool name there.
[10:41.910 --> 10:42.750]  Nothing suspicious.
[10:42.750 --> 10:44.990]  Doesn't get you thinking that they're doing anything weird.
[10:44.990 --> 10:46.070]  Groovy gravy, check them out.
[10:46.070 --> 10:50.230]  But be prepared because March 26th, I read genetics.
[10:50.230 --> 10:55.470]  We'll be attending the groovy gravy secret stash round two in Denver, Colorado.
[10:55.470 --> 10:56.310]  Come get some beans.
[10:56.310 --> 10:58.270]  Come get the Saka souffle.
[10:58.270 --> 10:59.390]  Come get the machine.
[10:59.390 --> 11:01.830]  Come get some blue raspberry truffle, some lady marmalade.
[11:01.830 --> 11:04.630]  I know there will be sun kiss and strawberry starburst.
[11:04.630 --> 11:09.790]  There could be some fems available that we were going to talk about on the next episode.
[11:09.790 --> 11:10.990]  We'll save that for the next episode.
[11:10.990 --> 11:12.710]  We'll talk about some of the shit coming up.
[11:12.710 --> 11:14.510]  You guys, I've been rambling for quite a while here.
[11:14.510 --> 11:18.430]  We haven't talked about any of the emails, no cannabis related content.
[11:18.430 --> 11:21.350]  People are going to say this show didn't start until it was 45 minutes in.
[11:21.350 --> 11:22.550]  It's only going to be a 30 minute show.
[11:22.550 --> 11:23.710]  I love you trolls on the internet.
[11:23.710 --> 11:25.590]  You guys are beautiful.
[11:25.590 --> 11:28.950]  Let's jump into some of the emails here because I do have quite a few in front of me.
[11:28.990 --> 11:31.110]  This one's labeled 717.
[11:31.110 --> 11:31.990]  That's this episode.
[11:31.990 --> 11:33.150]  What do you know?
[11:33.150 --> 11:35.230]  This episode goes a little bit like this.
[11:35.230 --> 11:36.430]  I found this one on YouTube.
[11:36.430 --> 11:38.110]  I don't usually take comments from YouTube.
[11:38.110 --> 11:39.670]  I don't read them on the show a lot.
[11:39.670 --> 11:40.590]  It's easier to email me.
[11:40.590 --> 11:41.230]  This one was good.
[11:41.230 --> 11:42.390]  It was worth it.
[11:42.390 --> 11:44.390]  It says, what did you do with the spider?
[11:44.390 --> 11:45.590]  I really want to know.
[11:45.590 --> 11:47.110]  A big shout out to my buddy Slim S.
[11:47.110 --> 11:48.350]  That's a good question.
[11:48.350 --> 11:51.030]  That shows me you've been watching, listening for quite a while.
[11:51.030 --> 11:55.790]  If you've been paying attention, a few episodes back I discovered a spider in my grow room.
[11:55.790 --> 11:57.830]  It was a little fuzzy spider.
[11:57.830 --> 12:00.070]  In California we call them Mexican jumping spiders.
[12:00.070 --> 12:02.110]  I don't know the Greek name.
[12:02.110 --> 12:03.630]  I don't know the species.
[12:03.630 --> 12:04.590]  I don't know the genotype.
[12:04.590 --> 12:06.110]  I don't know phenotype, what we got in there.
[12:06.110 --> 12:07.270]  I don't know the cross.
[12:07.270 --> 12:09.150]  I don't know it's mom and dad, phenotype and parents.
[12:09.150 --> 12:10.750]  I don't know the F1s of this spider.
[12:10.750 --> 12:13.630]  I know it was a little fuzzy, ugly fucking spider.
[12:13.630 --> 12:15.510]  He looked like he wasn't causing any problems.
[12:15.510 --> 12:17.030]  He wasn't making any webs.
[12:17.030 --> 12:19.190]  In my opinion, he was working security.
[12:19.190 --> 12:23.190]  He was eating fungus gnats, white flies, whatever may have chosen to pop into that grow room.
[12:23.190 --> 12:27.630]  He was working security and taking those bitches out because I didn't see any bugs in there for a while.
[12:27.670 --> 12:30.430]  This question said, what did you do with the spider?
[12:30.430 --> 12:32.270]  Bro, I didn't do anything with the spider.
[12:32.270 --> 12:33.350]  He just quit popping up.
[12:33.350 --> 12:34.350]  He quit coming around.
[12:34.350 --> 12:35.350]  He's gone.
[12:35.350 --> 12:40.150]  He either migrated or died or he's fucking somewhere else.
[12:40.150 --> 12:43.590]  He traveled somewhere else into that area and he's just hiding out, hanging out now.
[12:43.590 --> 12:44.590]  Got bored.
[12:44.590 --> 12:46.030]  Maybe he got tired of the grow lights.
[12:46.030 --> 12:47.030]  Maybe he got stoned.
[12:47.030 --> 12:48.030]  Maybe he's done.
[12:48.030 --> 12:49.030]  I don't know.
[12:49.030 --> 12:50.030]  He's probably dead by now.
[12:50.030 --> 12:52.990]  I don't know how long a little Mexican jumping spider lives, but he just disappeared.
[12:52.990 --> 12:53.990]  I didn't kill him.
[12:53.990 --> 12:55.590]  I didn't do anything to get rid of him.
[12:55.590 --> 12:57.470]  I didn't do anything to keep him around either.
[12:57.470 --> 12:58.750]  It was business as usual.
[12:58.750 --> 12:59.750]  I kept an eye on him.
[12:59.750 --> 13:01.510]  He kept an eye on me or she.
[13:01.510 --> 13:05.910]  I just gender assigned that spider and I have no idea, but eventually it disappeared and
[13:05.910 --> 13:07.110]  that's the end of the story, bro.
[13:07.110 --> 13:08.110]  I don't know.
[13:08.110 --> 13:09.110]  It just disappears like a dog.
[13:09.110 --> 13:10.110]  It wandered off and that was it.
[13:10.110 --> 13:11.390]  So, uh, thanks for asking.
[13:11.390 --> 13:12.830]  I'll let the spider know you asked about it.
[13:12.830 --> 13:15.670]  If I see it again, I'll shake its hand for you and tell him you said, what's up?
[13:15.670 --> 13:16.670]  Big shout out to our friend.
[13:16.670 --> 13:18.070]  I'll shake all eight of his fucking hands.
[13:18.070 --> 13:20.950]  Could you imagine shaking hands with spider doing the homie high fives?
[13:20.950 --> 13:21.950]  What's up bro?
[13:21.950 --> 13:24.030]  Shabang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang.
[13:24.030 --> 13:25.030]  I'm fucking high.
[13:25.150 --> 13:25.650]  All right.
[13:25.650 --> 13:27.830]  Shout out to my buddy Slim S. I don't know what ever happened to that spider.
[13:27.830 --> 13:28.830]  I hope he's well.
[13:28.830 --> 13:32.510]  I hope he found a nice spider wife and had some beautiful spider kids somewhere the fuck
[13:32.510 --> 13:33.510]  else not here.
[13:33.510 --> 13:34.510]  All right.
[13:34.510 --> 13:38.630]  This message came from Patreon, patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[13:38.630 --> 13:40.910]  That's my favorite place to find messages.
[13:40.910 --> 13:43.550]  This one came from my buddy Midnight Samurai.
[13:43.550 --> 13:44.710]  What's up buddy?
[13:44.710 --> 13:49.510]  Great grow, great photos, great updates and a great Patreon question or it's actually
[13:49.510 --> 13:50.510]  a comment.
[13:50.510 --> 13:55.550]  It says, dude, the fried PB and J has been a staple in my life since college for about
[13:55.550 --> 13:57.230]  20 years.
[13:57.230 --> 14:01.270]  If you've listened to the episode or the seven 11 episode that was about munchies.
[14:01.270 --> 14:05.190]  I talked about putting a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a pan and frying that bitch
[14:05.190 --> 14:07.310]  up just like you would a grilled cheese sandwich.
[14:07.310 --> 14:08.630]  The peanut butter gets all melty.
[14:08.630 --> 14:10.030]  The jelly gets all melty in there.
[14:10.030 --> 14:12.190]  It makes us gooey, delightful texture.
[14:12.190 --> 14:13.990]  Get that bread just a little bit crispy.
[14:13.990 --> 14:15.310]  Oh my goodness.
[14:15.310 --> 14:18.550]  That's a stoner snack that you cannot believe.
[14:18.550 --> 14:24.390]  This dude said, I have not once burnt the shit out of my mouth because I can never wait.
[14:24.390 --> 14:25.870]  Um, bro, same.
[14:25.870 --> 14:31.070]  I probably got scars and a reshaped mouth and a burnt palate because of many numerous
[14:31.070 --> 14:33.550]  fried or grilled peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[14:33.550 --> 14:37.350]  Do you guys call it a fried or grilled because it's the same thing you're throwing that bitch
[14:37.350 --> 14:39.350]  is it's a grilled cheese where you put peanut butter in that bitch.
[14:39.350 --> 14:42.230]  But my grandma always called her fried PB and J. Shout out to grandma.
[14:42.230 --> 14:43.230]  Rest in peace.
[14:43.230 --> 14:44.230]  Love you and miss you.
[14:44.230 --> 14:47.710]  She's the one that introduced me to the grilled or fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich
[14:47.870 --> 14:52.310]  and my lady taught me a lot of things and that is one of the top of the list of things
[14:52.310 --> 14:53.590]  that I'm going to remember forever.
[14:53.590 --> 14:56.630]  Bro, if you haven't done it yet, make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[14:56.630 --> 14:59.870]  Butter that bitch on both sides, throw in a pan until that peanut butter starts gushing
[14:59.870 --> 15:03.070]  out the sides and the bread gets a little fucking crispy.
[15:03.070 --> 15:04.070]  Thank me later.
[15:04.070 --> 15:07.310]  Send me an email or patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[15:07.310 --> 15:08.310]  That's the way to do it.
[15:08.310 --> 15:09.310]  All right.
[15:09.310 --> 15:10.310]  I'm stoned.
[15:10.310 --> 15:11.310]  I'm telling you we're through two of the emails already.
[15:11.310 --> 15:13.290]  We're like 20 minutes into this episode.
[15:13.290 --> 15:14.550]  Let's jump into this one.
[15:14.550 --> 15:16.790]  This one says, Hey, I read.
[15:16.870 --> 15:18.350]  Did I give a shout out to midnight samurai?
[15:18.350 --> 15:19.350]  Yeah.
[15:19.350 --> 15:20.350]  Shout out to midnight samurai.
[15:20.350 --> 15:21.350]  This one came from our friend.
[15:21.350 --> 15:23.750]  Do they want their name said, let's see.
[15:23.750 --> 15:24.750]  I'm going to call you Leo.
[15:24.750 --> 15:25.750]  What up Leo?
[15:25.750 --> 15:26.750]  This one came from our friend Leo.
[15:26.750 --> 15:28.150]  It says, hello, I read.
[15:28.150 --> 15:29.150]  What up Leo?
[15:29.150 --> 15:34.230]  Nice to meet you brother says, is it somehow possible to grow and collect pollen from multiple
[15:34.230 --> 15:39.950]  male plants and strains in one tent while keeping pollen separated or should it only
[15:39.950 --> 15:42.470]  be one male plant per tent?
[15:42.470 --> 15:43.990]  Then it follows up with what is the Beth?
[15:43.990 --> 15:44.990]  Okay.
[15:44.990 --> 15:46.470]  We're going to talk about two different questions here.
[15:47.150 --> 15:50.710]  The next part is what is the best method for growing and collecting pollen from multiple
[15:50.710 --> 15:51.710]  male strains?
[15:51.710 --> 15:52.710]  All right.
[15:52.710 --> 15:54.470]  So this is a really good question.
[15:54.470 --> 15:59.070]  The question here is, can I put basically, can I put multiple dudes in a tent and collect
[15:59.070 --> 16:02.430]  the pollen from those and then know what that pollen is?
[16:02.430 --> 16:03.430]  My answer is no, bro.
[16:03.430 --> 16:04.430]  I would not try that.
[16:04.430 --> 16:05.430]  I would not do that.
[16:05.430 --> 16:07.830]  I would not recommend that.
[16:07.830 --> 16:10.390]  There's no way to prevent pollen from this plant.
[16:10.390 --> 16:14.150]  Just drifting over to this plant, this pollen drifting over to this one.
[16:14.150 --> 16:16.110]  You have no way of knowing which pollen is which.
[16:16.110 --> 16:20.750]  Even if you do go tap that plant and get pollen out of it, the first one you touch, that pollen's
[16:20.750 --> 16:22.510]  going all over all of the plants.
[16:22.510 --> 16:26.310]  Now everyone you touch is the first one plus the second one.
[16:26.310 --> 16:28.750]  And then when you touch the second one, now you're just compounding.
[16:28.750 --> 16:29.750]  You see what I'm saying?
[16:29.750 --> 16:31.790]  You're going to have number one, you might be cool.
[16:31.790 --> 16:33.830]  Number two, you're going to have number one and number two.
[16:33.830 --> 16:36.510]  Number three is going to be one, two, and three and four is going to be a clusterfuck
[16:36.510 --> 16:38.590]  of every male plant in there.
[16:38.590 --> 16:43.310]  So I replied to our friend Leo and I said, I would stick with one male plant in the room
[16:43.470 --> 16:46.670]  or you're going to have a Maury Povich situation.
[16:46.670 --> 16:49.270]  Nobody going to know who the baby daddy is.
[16:49.270 --> 16:51.110]  If that's okay with you, that's fine.
[16:51.110 --> 16:54.630]  But I like to know pedigree and history of the plants.
[16:54.630 --> 16:57.590]  There's a reason, a rhyme and a reason why I'm making the cross.
[16:57.590 --> 17:00.590]  I want that selected male to do a certain thing.
[17:00.590 --> 17:05.070]  If you're just trying to do an open pollination of multiple plants to make seeds for fun,
[17:05.070 --> 17:06.950]  you can do multiple males.
[17:06.950 --> 17:12.230]  It is not uncommon to take, let's say we wanted to make an arise open pollination just to
[17:12.230 --> 17:17.190]  make a bunch more arise seeds, show diversity and see what is in that seed line.
[17:17.190 --> 17:22.830]  I would take a pack of males or a pack of arise seeds, a number of 10, 20, 30 seeds,
[17:22.830 --> 17:26.190]  whatever you got room for time for space, grow them.
[17:26.190 --> 17:29.390]  You're going to find a number of males and a number of females.
[17:29.390 --> 17:34.150]  I would kind of maybe pull out a couple things that are not, not exactly what I want.
[17:34.150 --> 17:37.790]  Pull them out, take them out of there, but then leave a few males and a few females in
[17:37.790 --> 17:38.790]  there.
[17:38.790 --> 17:40.990]  They're all arise and just do an open pollination.
[17:41.070 --> 17:46.590]  You've got, we'll just say arise F3 open pollination with three or four males and five females.
[17:46.590 --> 17:50.910]  Then when I sell them or talk about them, I would list descriptions of each male and
[17:50.910 --> 17:53.830]  female and then we would just see what comes out of there.
[17:53.830 --> 17:58.950]  That's a beautiful open pollination because that shows diversity amongst all of those
[17:58.950 --> 18:03.350]  different genotypes and phenotypes in that one because we're going to see genotypes from
[18:03.350 --> 18:06.030]  the two different genes crossing and phenotypes from different expressions.
[18:06.030 --> 18:10.230]  You're going to see a lot of different shit by crossing that open pollination, different
[18:10.230 --> 18:12.670]  males to different females.
[18:12.670 --> 18:16.150]  But the problem with that, in my opinion, you don't know who the baby daddy is.
[18:16.150 --> 18:19.270]  So if you want to make more of those, you don't know which male to grab and which female
[18:19.270 --> 18:21.710]  to grab to make that happen.
[18:21.710 --> 18:27.510]  But at the same time as a breeder, as a somebody who wants to see a lot of expression, a lot
[18:27.510 --> 18:30.790]  of things, a lot of traits, I want a lot of data is what I'm trying to say.
[18:30.790 --> 18:34.910]  I love that open pollination because it lets me know what is in there somewhere.
[18:34.910 --> 18:38.070]  I may not know exactly where it is, but I know it's in that pack.
[18:38.070 --> 18:41.750]  I know somewhere I can find that fucking plant and I can breed that again and create
[18:41.750 --> 18:43.350]  it shows me potential.
[18:43.350 --> 18:48.430]  So unless you're doing an open pollination to forward one line, I wouldn't do this.
[18:48.430 --> 18:53.670]  If you've got like a male of Arise and a male of Jack the Ripper and a male of Candy Store,
[18:53.670 --> 18:54.830]  I wouldn't do that.
[18:54.830 --> 18:56.310]  I would have one dude in there.
[18:56.310 --> 18:58.790]  I would get his pollen and I would work with him.
[18:58.790 --> 19:02.550]  Otherwise, the best way to say it, bro, you're going to have a baby daddy situation.
[19:02.550 --> 19:04.630]  There's no way to keep that pollen separated.
[19:04.630 --> 19:05.630]  I would not do that.
[19:05.630 --> 19:09.230]  If you really want to collect pollen from multiple males, I would stagger them.
[19:09.230 --> 19:10.870]  I would flower one out.
[19:10.870 --> 19:14.590]  It only takes a few days to get pollen, maybe 21 days to get plenty of pollen out of that
[19:14.590 --> 19:15.590]  dude.
[19:15.590 --> 19:19.730]  Get pollen, cut him down, clean it up, start over, get another dude.
[19:19.730 --> 19:21.990]  You can have the other guy vegging, just have him on standby.
[19:21.990 --> 19:25.750]  All you can do is throw them into flower as soon as you're done cleaning up or like two
[19:25.750 --> 19:27.670]  days before you cut down because you're going to get time.
[19:27.670 --> 19:29.890]  There's time ahead before the pollen starts coming.
[19:29.890 --> 19:33.710]  As long as you can clean up the old pollen before the new pollen starts coming, you can
[19:33.710 --> 19:36.070]  perpetually make pollen for yourself.
[19:36.070 --> 19:38.310]  Now, don't contaminate that pollen.
[19:38.310 --> 19:39.590]  Don't cross that pollen.
[19:39.590 --> 19:41.630]  There's more to the question that I do want to cover.
[19:41.630 --> 19:44.630]  What's the best method for growing and collecting pollen from multiple?
[19:44.630 --> 19:45.630]  I wouldn't do that.
[19:45.630 --> 19:48.110]  So that answers the second part there.
[19:48.110 --> 19:49.110]  Like you to save after separating.
[19:49.110 --> 19:51.590]  Yeah, I just would not do that.
[19:51.590 --> 19:54.790]  Definitely wouldn't have multiple dudes in there.
[19:54.790 --> 19:57.230]  I'm reading this quietly to myself to make sure I covered it.
[19:57.230 --> 20:00.030]  Multiple strains and having a few different males you'd like to save after separate.
[20:00.030 --> 20:01.790]  Yeah, I just wouldn't do that, dude.
[20:01.790 --> 20:04.510]  It's not going to work the way that you want it to.
[20:04.510 --> 20:09.310]  It's going to be that Maury Povich situation, just like I'm talking about, who is the father.
[20:09.310 --> 20:10.310]  You're not the father.
[20:10.310 --> 20:11.570]  Maybe you are the father.
[20:11.570 --> 20:14.270]  If you want to make seeds, if you want something to play with, that is really cool.
[20:14.270 --> 20:16.190]  That could really work for you.
[20:16.190 --> 20:21.590]  But if you want something to put to market, to make F2s with, to really work on, I would
[20:21.590 --> 20:24.230]  kind of, I wouldn't do that.
[20:24.230 --> 20:25.230]  That's the bottom line there.
[20:25.230 --> 20:29.190]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[20:29.190 --> 20:32.830]  home cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there,
[20:32.830 --> 20:35.990]  I want to thank you once again for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[20:35.990 --> 20:36.990]  podcast.
[20:36.990 --> 20:37.990]  This may be a short episode.
[20:37.990 --> 20:43.070]  I'm testing a new SD card and my device is flickering, so I'm not sure if I'm recording
[20:43.070 --> 20:44.990]  the audio or not.
[20:44.990 --> 20:45.990]  Let's hope for the best.
[20:45.990 --> 20:46.990]  Prepare for the worst.
[20:46.990 --> 20:47.990]  Make it a short show.
[20:47.990 --> 20:51.350]  That way, if it doesn't work out, I didn't waste all this material, we could rerecord
[20:51.350 --> 20:53.450]  and do it again and make a quality show for you.
[20:53.450 --> 20:57.590]  You guys didn't really care any about all of that, but that's what is really happening.
[20:57.590 --> 20:59.030]  Straight up transparency here.
[20:59.030 --> 21:00.030]  Quick show, good times.
[21:00.030 --> 21:01.030]  Thank you for hanging out.
[21:01.030 --> 21:02.030]  Love you.

[21:12.510 --> 21:13.990]  I think that's all I've got for you.
[21:13.990 --> 21:15.350]  I want to make sure I've recorded it.
[21:15.350 --> 21:17.670]  I'm going to go edit this down, make sure we got a good show.
[21:17.670 --> 21:20.630]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[21:20.630 --> 21:25.630]  Stay tuned because my best friend, White Mike, will be here for episode 719.
[21:25.630 --> 21:27.910]  I maybe have multiple best friends.
[21:27.910 --> 21:32.550]  I should say one of my best friends, White Mike, will be here for episode 719.
[21:32.550 --> 21:33.550]  Stay tuned.
[21:33.550 --> 21:34.550]  Check him out.
[21:34.550 --> 21:35.550]  We got a good show prepared for you.
[21:35.550 --> 21:36.550]  I bought another microphone.
[21:36.550 --> 21:37.550]  He'll be sitting right here, maybe over here.
[21:37.550 --> 21:39.950]  I haven't decided what side we're going to put him on.
[21:39.950 --> 21:40.950]  I think I want to drive.
[21:40.950 --> 21:42.190]  I want to be on the driver's side.
[21:42.190 --> 21:43.190]  That's over here.
[21:43.190 --> 21:44.550]  I'm not sure which side of the camera makes that look like.
[21:44.550 --> 21:45.670]  It may be flipped.
[21:45.670 --> 21:46.670]  Who knows?
[21:46.670 --> 21:49.630]  But Mike will be here for episode 719, 718.
[21:49.630 --> 21:51.150]  I've got a bunch of emails here in front of me.
[21:51.150 --> 21:53.910]  I'm going to save this one because it's kind of longer than I was prepared for.
[21:53.910 --> 21:55.070]  Guys, I am rambling.
[21:55.070 --> 21:56.070]  I said quick episode.
[21:56.070 --> 21:57.350]  I stretched out, made it long.
[21:57.350 --> 21:58.350]  For no reason.
[21:58.350 --> 21:59.350]  Thanks for hanging out.
[21:59.350 --> 22:00.630]  I love you more than fat kids love cake.
[22:00.630 --> 22:03.190]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[22:03.190 --> 22:05.710]  Let's give a big shout out to Dave's Not Here.
[22:05.710 --> 22:10.350]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
