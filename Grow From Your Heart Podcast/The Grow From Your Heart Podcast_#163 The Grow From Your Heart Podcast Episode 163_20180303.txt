[00:17.280 --> 00:22.640]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community. Let me clear my throat for episode number 163
[00:22.640 --> 00:26.720]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:26.720 --> 00:31.120]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:31.120 --> 00:34.760]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.760 --> 00:39.520]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:39.520 --> 00:43.280]  host. My friends call me Ross DeGiaffona. Thank you guys again for joining me. As always,
[00:43.280 --> 00:46.440]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band for
[00:46.440 --> 00:50.520]  letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
[00:50.520 --> 00:55.920]  Mystic Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for dealing with the clogged up throat. It's
[00:55.920 --> 01:00.200]  Jesse's fault. I blame it on Jesse. Jesse showed up with good hash and liquid turps.
[01:00.200 --> 01:05.200]  Welcome to the show, Jesse. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, Jesse Grose is back. If you're
[01:05.200 --> 01:09.520]  not following Jesse on Instagram, follow him on Instagram. It's at jessegrose, I'm pretty
[01:09.520 --> 01:13.080]  sure. Yeah, follow him there. Also, he's got a podcast. Tell everyone how they can find
[01:13.080 --> 01:19.760]  your podcast, bro. On SoundCloud? On SoundCloud. Yeah, it's the Colorado podcast. Colorado
[01:19.760 --> 01:24.880]  podcast. You guys check that out. He's got Despicable D on there. He's got 44 on there.
[01:24.880 --> 01:28.880]  And sometimes there's a dude named Fetus that hangs out. Who else has been on the show?
[01:28.880 --> 01:34.720]  Tater. Tater. What up, Tater? I actually mentioned Tater yesterday. Nice. Yeah, I haven't heard
[01:34.720 --> 01:38.800]  from that dude in a long time. Is he in Colorado again? Yeah. Oh, man. I thought he was gone.
[01:38.800 --> 01:41.480]  So what's up, Tater? We're gonna have to get together. I owe you a high five and a dab.
[01:41.480 --> 01:44.920]  We gotta hang out, bro. There you go. Shout out to Tater if you listen to the podcast.
[01:44.920 --> 01:49.160]  Two episodes in a row. You got you got a mention, bro. Um, so Jesse's back. Hey, something I
[01:49.160 --> 01:53.080]  gotta mention you guys. I know. I know. I'm gonna get a whole bunch of fucking messages.
[01:53.080 --> 01:57.160]  I said the wrong episode number at the start of the last episode. I did not have any notes
[01:57.160 --> 02:00.400]  in front of me with the episode number written on it like I normally do. I wrote it down
[02:00.400 --> 02:03.920]  this time. I think I got it right. Although I did have to clear my throat. We did the
[02:03.920 --> 02:10.440]  best we could. Please stop with the tweets. I know I said the wrong. I love you guys.
[02:10.440 --> 02:15.440]  You're trying to keep me on the right path. So before we hit record here, Jesse, we like
[02:15.440 --> 02:19.320]  to hang out before the podcast. We get nice and medicated. We get into a talking little
[02:19.320 --> 02:23.480]  zone here. Jesse's kind of been on a on a cleanse, hasn't been taking a lot of dabs,
[02:23.480 --> 02:26.400]  hasn't been consuming a lot of cannabis. So when he took the first dab, I watched him
[02:26.400 --> 02:29.960]  get high. That was kind of to see he's a big dude. And I just watched him kind of melt
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.520]  a little bit after the first dab. He brought over some liquid SFV, some San Fernando Valley
[02:35.520 --> 02:42.200]  OG Kush turps and some Durban poison wax. I dunked a dab of what am I smoking? Some
[02:42.200 --> 02:47.040]  Jack Flash. Yeah, I dunked a dab of Jack Flash into the turps. I was terpidellic. It was
[02:47.040 --> 02:51.360]  amazing. Dude, thank you. Terpidellic. Terpidellic. I think that might be my word. I might be
[02:51.360 --> 02:57.520]  the only one that says terpidellic. Webster's new word of the year. Webster's swag shenari.
[02:57.520 --> 03:01.000]  So we were talking before the show. As I was mentioning, we're getting nice and roasted
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.400]  and medicated, taking dabs off the email. And Jesse was telling me that he went to
[03:05.400 --> 03:10.560]  Oregon and he was actually ballsy enough to take his medicine on the plane with him. A
[03:10.560 --> 03:13.720]  whole bunch of it. A whole bunch of it. Well, tell it, tell everybody what you traveled
[03:13.720 --> 03:20.360]  on a plane with. I took some Libra's some. This is going to sound ridiculous. I took
[03:20.360 --> 03:30.360]  Libra's water hash, rosin, some flour, a little bit of clear, some turps and a couple of the
[03:30.360 --> 03:34.120]  doctor's orders of eight pink cartridges. Did you have a rig with you? And two rigs.
[03:34.120 --> 03:38.000]  Pretty much everything but a torch. Yeah. Yeah. I knew not to take a torch. Yeah. You
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.960]  cannot take the torch. They'll take the torch. That is very similar to a bomb. It's already
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.240]  a bomb essentially. So they don't, they don't want that on the plane. So I took all that.
[03:46.240 --> 03:52.840]  Well, the rigs were in a locked case. So, and I, I put the rigs in my check-in baggage.
[03:52.840 --> 03:59.920]  Okay. All the product though, I kept it on my purse or in my carry on. It was back sealed
[04:00.480 --> 04:07.360]  in a Ziploc baggie. And I took my med card and a copy of my driver's license and put
[04:07.360 --> 04:12.480]  it in there. So it was the first thing they would see. They totally went through my bag
[04:12.480 --> 04:18.200]  and it went through the x-ray scanner and everything. And I flew there and back with,
[04:18.200 --> 04:21.960]  with it all. Okay. And nobody gave you any harassment at all? Never. So you got to enjoy
[04:21.960 --> 04:26.240]  your medical marijuana while you were in the great state of Oregon and Washington and Washington.
[04:26.240 --> 04:29.400]  Yeah. I flew out of a different airport. Oh, that is cool. Sounds like you had a great
[04:29.400 --> 04:34.800]  vacation. Yeah, it was, it was awesome. Very much needed. What was the, what was your favorite
[04:34.800 --> 04:42.560]  part? Getting to see my best friend from high school and lifelong buddy get married to a
[04:42.560 --> 04:50.080]  woman he is absolutely crazy about was very cool. But the Oregon coast is just absolutely
[04:50.080 --> 04:56.480]  unbelievable. It's so stunning. Nice. It, yeah. I, I highly recommend checking it out.
[04:56.480 --> 04:59.600]  Shout out to the new, to the new married couple. I don't know if they listened to a podcast,
[04:59.600 --> 05:04.080]  but no, probably not. Shout out to them in either way. The energy is out in the air now.
[05:04.080 --> 05:09.520]  Yeah. Yeah. Cool. I'm glad you're back. I'm glad you had a great time. I've been trying to get you
[05:09.520 --> 05:13.200]  on for a little while. You've been a busy dude. You've got a, a new job there. We were talking
[05:13.200 --> 05:17.360]  about how many plants you run. Will was on yesterday. Will was running, I think he said
[05:17.360 --> 05:22.160]  640 plants is what I think he said on his own. And now we're talking and you're running, you've
[05:22.160 --> 05:27.360]  got beds of 500 plants, sections of 500 plants. So everybody's been killing it with a big commercial
[05:27.360 --> 05:31.840]  grow. I'm proud of you guys. That's awesome to hear. It's a lot of work. This is a,
[05:33.360 --> 05:38.880]  basically I've had, I've ran little med shop grows and now I'm in a big, yeah, it's a lot
[05:38.880 --> 05:44.400]  of fucking work. Isn't it? You were saying earlier that it took you all day to cut a three to 400
[05:44.400 --> 05:48.240]  clones. Yeah. Yeah. People, there are people that would probably, they probably heard that
[05:48.240 --> 05:53.520]  they went shit, man. I could probably cut a thousand clones today of grade a, you know,
[05:53.520 --> 05:58.240]  perfectly chosen, perfectly chosen. And you said that you don't keep mother plants that you take
[05:58.240 --> 06:02.960]  the clones off the veg plants. You've got to run through the veg area with a cup or a container of
[06:02.960 --> 06:08.800]  water and get cuts, gather them up and then go back to the cloning area. Consult back with the,
[06:08.800 --> 06:13.920]  with the schedule. I've got to look at the schedule of stuff that's already been harvested.
[06:13.920 --> 06:19.920]  And I got to look at the stuff that is going to be before it so that we have, we have a specific
[06:19.920 --> 06:27.520]  program to harvest four strains a week out of our 16 strains so that we always have X strain on hand
[06:27.520 --> 06:32.480]  and to keep in track with all that also is it's a lot of work, man. That's the things that people
[06:32.480 --> 06:37.440]  don't think about is trying to keep the variety coming consistently because in a grow, you're
[06:37.440 --> 06:42.320]  going to want to put, let's do this whole row of sour diesel per se, just because you want that
[06:42.320 --> 06:46.880]  whole row. But then when it comes time to put it on the shelf, now you've got a whole bunch of
[06:46.880 --> 06:50.560]  sour diesel. So if somebody comes to the dispensary to buy product, we're going to shoot a ton of
[06:50.560 --> 06:55.040]  sour diesel if that's all you're interested in. And then see, we're a wholesaler, so that makes
[06:55.040 --> 07:00.960]  it even worse. So the dispensary buyer comes to us and you know, we got a whole bunch of sour diesel,
[07:01.840 --> 07:06.640]  even if it's bomb, you know, they're probably just going to go on. So that's one of the big
[07:06.640 --> 07:10.960]  reasons we have to have a, everybody likes the variety. You need that 31 flavors. Yeah. That's
[07:10.960 --> 07:14.000]  what keeps them coming back. If you could probably, if you could probably sell 10 pounds of
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.080]  that sour diesel, but if you had five other strains, you could probably sell seven pounds of
[07:18.080 --> 07:22.560]  each one of them just because of the variety. Yeah. Yeah. So variety is king. That's good.
[07:22.560 --> 07:26.560]  People don't think about what it takes. I've been talking a little bit about it on the show about
[07:26.560 --> 07:30.160]  commercial growing. People don't think about what it takes. It's good to hear you come in and talk
[07:30.160 --> 07:34.640]  about just scheduling the clones because it starts at the clones. You got to schedule the clones
[07:34.640 --> 07:42.320]  to know what your variety is going to be in about 120 days. Yeah. Yeah. So that's more like
[07:43.120 --> 07:50.320]  90 for, for my situation, but you know, still it's yeah, it's a plan planning preparation.
[07:50.320 --> 07:53.680]  And then everything you do, this is something that I got sidetracked on when I was talking
[07:53.680 --> 07:58.720]  with will, everything you do has to be documented in metric. Pretty much if your scissors touch a
[07:58.720 --> 08:03.920]  plant, you have to open up a computer and make a note somewhere in the damn computer that something
[08:03.920 --> 08:10.080]  happened. We have one person spends 40 hours a week doing nothing but that man. Yeah. Yeah. I
[08:10.080 --> 08:15.760]  mean, that's yeah. This Mac book on a cart, which was actually a trash can with a piece of wood on
[08:15.760 --> 08:19.360]  top of it. Cause I had a trash can on wheels that I pushed around to water. One of the smaller areas
[08:19.360 --> 08:23.120]  it was like for water and small plants. I would put a board on top of that and put the Mac book
[08:23.120 --> 08:27.280]  on top of there. And that was my metric station. You roll that around and just do my metric right
[08:27.280 --> 08:34.480]  there all day long. I just made 900 clones of this, just harvested this. Yeah. If you cut off.
[08:35.200 --> 08:39.600]  So there are varying different, different compliance officers will tell you different
[08:39.600 --> 08:45.120]  rules on this. Uh, if you cut off something on a plant, it needs to be weighed and documented in
[08:45.120 --> 08:50.400]  metric. You have to go to that plant tag number. You have to say, I manicured 0.4 grams off of
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.760]  plant number nine zero five five five. And then you have to show on camera that you destroyed
[08:55.760 --> 09:00.880]  the part that was manicured off the plant. It's, it's very tedious in metric. Oh yeah. Very tedious.
[09:01.440 --> 09:05.440]  All right. So we talked about dabs on a plane. Jesse got away with taking a shit on a plane and
[09:05.440 --> 09:08.880]  he looks like an ogre too. And they didn't even mess with those. Also. Uh, and then we talked
[09:08.880 --> 09:12.880]  about your new grow space and let's talk about what we brought you here for, uh, the main topic
[09:12.880 --> 09:16.560]  that you, uh, when we talked on Facebook, you're like, I want to talk about reminding people to
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.760]  clean up their grow space after the outdoor season. For sure. Yeah. So, uh, what do you want
[09:21.760 --> 09:27.440]  to tell us about that? Cause that is a super good topic. Um, I mean, it depends on how you grow,
[09:27.440 --> 09:35.040]  I guess, but you know, uh, I'm an organic grower kind of homestead style is a term, um, a real
[09:35.040 --> 09:40.640]  farmer. Yeah. Yeah. It's a term I've been using lately. I picked it up from a person in Oregon.
[09:40.640 --> 09:45.440]  So we should give that person a shout out. Did you mention the podcast to them at all? No, no,
[09:46.080 --> 09:51.200]  she didn't even have internet, man. Yeah. I'm not surprised. Hippie Mary. She lived, uh,
[09:51.200 --> 09:58.400]  on the coast, down the road from, uh, the place I was staying. And, um, it's normally not like
[09:58.400 --> 10:04.080]  me to go out and just randomly start talking to strangers. But for some reason I, uh, there were
[10:04.080 --> 10:09.120]  some huge tomato plants in her yard that kind of attracted me to her. So ended up making a friend
[10:09.120 --> 10:13.440]  out there, but that's the true farmer in you. Yeah. The tomato plants, the tomato plants are
[10:13.440 --> 10:17.440]  done in Colorado. They've been harvested and eaten by now. And she had tomatoes up there and
[10:17.440 --> 10:24.720]  Jesse was like, Ooh, pretty much. That's rad. Yeah, no, that's a, I told her how she grows
[10:24.720 --> 10:30.400]  or how I grew because she, she actually had a couple of plants out back too, but, uh, I told
[10:30.400 --> 10:35.760]  her how I grew and she called me a homestead farmer. So, or homestead grower. So I kind of
[10:35.760 --> 10:42.560]  like that term. I like that. It feels good. For sure. Um, but my situation I've got living soil,
[10:43.120 --> 10:49.600]  um, I've got a whole bunch of plant waste, the leaves, the stocks, all that. So I've taken all
[10:49.600 --> 10:55.920]  of that and run it through a chipper into the compost pile. Um, so by next, you know, summer,
[10:55.920 --> 11:01.040]  that will be nice black compost and it'll have, you know, all the nutrients that were still in it.
[11:01.600 --> 11:06.800]  And this is the, this will be the third year we've done this, but it just all goes right back
[11:06.800 --> 11:13.680]  into the system again. That's awesome. Um, so I, I mulched up my soil real good. I watered it
[11:13.680 --> 11:18.800]  down real good. Um, and I've got it covered with plastic to store it over the winter.
[11:19.600 --> 11:23.600]  Um, is that going to make a nice, uh, mycelium layer happened in there and you get some funk.
[11:23.600 --> 11:27.520]  Okay. And that's a good thing. You guys, when you start seeing a lot of people see that white
[11:27.520 --> 11:31.280]  fuzz, they'll make some super soil or they'll make some compost. Yeah. And they see that white
[11:31.280 --> 11:35.840]  fuzz and they freak out. That's what you're working for. That's the goal. That white fuzz is magic.
[11:36.960 --> 11:41.680]  Yes, sir. That's what's going to make all the shit happen. Um, all right. So you got your
[11:41.680 --> 11:47.600]  compost pile covered. Yeah. We, uh, got all that handled. Uh, the plastic is good for several things.
[11:47.600 --> 11:55.600]  Um, it, it helps insulate the soil, um, on really cold days. I mean, on really cold days, it's,
[11:55.600 --> 12:01.200]  it's going to get cold. There's nothing you can do about that, but on days when it warms up and
[12:01.200 --> 12:07.840]  then it cools off again, it can, the warmer the soil stays, the more breakdown happens,
[12:07.840 --> 12:13.200]  the more healthy bio-activity stays alive. Yeah. Um, so it protects it from that. It protects it
[12:13.200 --> 12:20.480]  from getting blown away, drying out and blowing, you know, all the precious topsoil off. Um,
[12:20.480 --> 12:26.000]  and then also something I've noticed last year is it keeps the damn neighborhood cats from, uh,
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.760]  neighborhood cats love to, uh, piss and do their thing in your, uh, in your nice,
[12:31.760 --> 12:36.960]  fresh garden soil. So it keeps them away too. Perfect. Yeah. Yes. Cats probably helps keep
[12:36.960 --> 12:42.320]  the birds out. It's possibly, Oh, birds wouldn't be so bad, but yeah. But yeah. So
[12:43.440 --> 12:48.240]  scooping chicken shit into there. Oh yeah. Well, that goes into the compost pile. So
[12:48.240 --> 12:54.000]  it just all returns back to the, do you use a Bokashi bucket at home? Yes. You pour that Bokashi
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.280]  bucket right into there. Do you have another use for it? Um, normally I put it in the compost pile
[12:59.280 --> 13:06.160]  or I'll just bury it directly in one of the beds. Okay. Um, but here lately I'm going to go ahead
[13:06.160 --> 13:11.280]  and compost it inside after it's done in the bucket. I'm going to put it in a little miniature
[13:11.280 --> 13:18.640]  tumbler I made. Um, and that'll be to reduce or make it less acidic. Okay. Um, and then I'm going
[13:18.640 --> 13:24.480]  to feed it to my new worm inside worm bins. So awesome. Yeah. You and Spencer both doing worms,
[13:25.520 --> 13:29.200]  barefoot doing worms. Everyone's going to worm life. It's awesome. I love it. It's good to see
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.480]  everybody doing the worms. Have you tried to use the stuff from your Bokashi bucket, the drainage
[13:34.480 --> 13:38.160]  that they call it the leachate, that stinky foot smelling juice that comes out of there.
[13:38.800 --> 13:44.240]  If you have a clogged drain, pour that shit right down the drain, like probably two ounces down a
[13:44.240 --> 13:48.240]  clogged drain and it'll dissolve. If you got like a hair clog or whatever's in there, it'll,
[13:48.480 --> 13:52.720]  I've got these dreadlocks down to my fucking knees. So I get some hair clogs in the drain,
[13:52.720 --> 13:56.240]  the shower, just pour that in there. It'll clean it right up. It'll stink. You got to pour it in
[13:56.240 --> 13:59.760]  there, let it soak all through. I give it like an hour and then just go run the hot water,
[13:59.760 --> 14:03.680]  kind of push it down and get rid of the smell, but it eats it right up. Nice. Yeah. I remember
[14:03.680 --> 14:07.840]  you telling me you, uh, cleaned a clone machine with it once too. Yeah. Just put that in the
[14:07.840 --> 14:12.240]  corner and let it run. It eats up all the basically dissolves all the, uh, that funky layer that the
[14:12.240 --> 14:16.320]  corner gets covered in calcium and stuff. Yeah. You guys take good care of your cloners. I had
[14:16.320 --> 14:20.080]  a cloner, uh, since I didn't clean it out good enough, it got clogged up and fried itself. So
[14:20.080 --> 14:24.320]  my fault. Whoops. Yep. Yep. All right. We were talking about compost piles. Sorry. I totally
[14:24.320 --> 14:32.320]  set, tried to sidetrack you. Another thing on that, uh, on the Bokashi liquid that is basically,
[14:32.320 --> 14:39.200]  or I've been told this from two people that really know their stuff. That is basically EM1. Yes. So,
[14:39.920 --> 14:47.680]  um, it's like great white shark essentially. Yeah. I've been using EM1 all summer and I
[14:47.680 --> 14:52.160]  have been getting it from a friend. I've been making it myself and I'm out. So for the last
[14:52.160 --> 14:56.960]  couple of weeks, I've just been using Bokashi bucket juice when I normally would use the EM1
[14:57.600 --> 15:04.640]  and I see no noticeable changes, good or bad. Yeah. Yeah. Other than the, uh, the, uh, rotting
[15:04.640 --> 15:10.560]  trash can decaying foot smell, there's such great stuff. It smells like a bar dumpster. Yeah.
[15:11.200 --> 15:14.400]  That has food too. That somebody threw up in. Yeah.
[15:17.280 --> 15:20.960]  All right. So you're composting all of your stocks, all of your big leaves that aren't usable
[15:20.960 --> 15:25.120]  for any product. Uh, that's all going into the compost pile. The chicken shits in there,
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.720]  all your food waste that you've been eating all the time goes into your Bokashi bucket. So you're
[15:30.720 --> 15:35.680]  making fertilizer out of that, that gets buried. We've got our soil covered up, got the soil
[15:35.680 --> 15:40.720]  covered up. You can actually re if you're, you know, I'm not necessarily no till where I'm at.
[15:40.720 --> 15:46.240]  Um, so you can go ahead and actually reamend now and put all your amendments you would put in,
[15:46.240 --> 15:51.280]  in the spring. And it just makes everything better. How much of that old root ball do I
[15:51.280 --> 15:54.480]  need to get out of there before I do that? I leave all of it in. You leave all, you just
[15:54.480 --> 16:00.320]  chop the stick and then kind of dig another hole later. Yeah. And if you keep the soil wet and
[16:00.400 --> 16:06.160]  active throughout the winter and the early spring, there will be no root ball when you come back to
[16:06.160 --> 16:10.800]  it. If you let it dry out and you don't cover it, the root ball will still very much be there.
[16:10.800 --> 16:16.880]  Okay. Okay. Keep it moist and the earth will eat it. Reassimilate it, turn it back into food. Okay.
[16:16.880 --> 16:23.920]  All right. So you can reamend now in the winter and that stuff will hopefully re it'll colonize
[16:23.920 --> 16:27.200]  and keep producing itself. Right. And then you'll have even more potent soil by the time it's time
[16:27.200 --> 16:32.400]  to go outdoors. Okay. So, and then at that point, the only things I would add in would just be
[16:33.440 --> 16:40.800]  like kelp and alfalfa, things that are, they're going to break down all the way through to where,
[16:40.800 --> 16:47.280]  you know, there's basically none left for it. So, you know, go ahead and I really stumbled all over
[16:47.280 --> 16:55.360]  that. Go ahead. When you plant, go ahead and do like a mycorrhiza inoculant and then add a little
[16:55.360 --> 16:59.600]  kelp. And this is when you're planting them. Yeah. Okay. And a little alfalfa to the soil.
[16:59.600 --> 17:04.400]  Okay. You'll be ready to roll. So nice. We can talk more about that in later shows. Yeah. We're
[17:04.400 --> 17:08.080]  definitely going to record a whole bunch of outdoor episodes for next year so that we've got them
[17:08.080 --> 17:12.880]  prepared. Yeah. We were both so busy this year. Yeah. These big commercial grows keep us on our
[17:12.880 --> 17:18.960]  feet. My summer next year is looking to be even busier. So how do you already know that? Well,
[17:18.960 --> 17:25.600]  because it's only a few months away. That is true. So yeah, that's after November,
[17:25.600 --> 17:30.480]  we'll, we'll know if it's going to happen or not. So we're just waiting until then, but we have an
[17:30.480 --> 17:37.520]  out and this is a whole nother outfit. We, we have an outline, we have property, they have licensing,
[17:37.520 --> 17:42.160]  everything like that. So excellent. Just waiting to pull the trigger. Everything you seem to get
[17:42.160 --> 17:46.880]  involved in seems to take off and get a good launch. So I'm sure it's going to work for you.
[17:46.880 --> 17:50.560]  I've been, uh, yeah, I stumble into all these startups. It's kind of weird.
[17:51.360 --> 17:54.240]  Cause you're a guy that can get shit done and people need somebody like you. They can get
[17:54.240 --> 17:59.920]  shit done. True. And the, the growth store doesn't hurt either. And I, uh, I know how to grow and I
[17:59.920 --> 18:04.880]  know how, I know how to do things, but I don't know as much on how to get shit done as you do.
[18:04.880 --> 18:09.520]  So I need a guy like you to fucking build the walls and build the tables. And then once you
[18:09.520 --> 18:14.080]  got the tables built, then I can come in and build the watering system and run the plants. So that's,
[18:14.080 --> 18:18.560]  that's why you're on the move and I'm on the move. Yeah. And then we run it a few times and
[18:18.560 --> 18:22.480]  they decided we need to remodel and rebuild. And so call Jesse back. I'll take a few months off
[18:22.480 --> 18:26.160]  and go somewhere else and Jesse come rebuild and I'll come back and regrow and we'll just
[18:26.160 --> 18:30.000]  keep playing dance around and build shit. I'll grow, go grow up places. Nice. Yeah.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.040]  You're a man on the move. Maybe we'll get you growing outdoors this summer.
[18:33.040 --> 18:36.880]  Ooh, that sounds awesome. We can't do it here. I mean, my backyard fences.
[18:37.680 --> 18:42.720]  No, I'm talking like 3,500 plants. Let's do it. I'm in, let's go get a sunburn. I'm game.
[18:43.280 --> 18:48.480]  And then I'll buy an O for long enough. Hey, we'll work in the shade of the plants.
[18:48.480 --> 18:53.520]  There we go. Yeah. Grow them tall enough where I can be shaded under them. That's rad. I'm so in,
[18:53.520 --> 18:58.960]  I'm so in. So you guys, Jesse mentioned, he said, uh, we will wait till November to decide if that's
[18:58.960 --> 19:03.600]  going to happen. There's an election coming up. Um, we may get a president that doesn't want
[19:03.600 --> 19:08.400]  medical cannabis or recreational cannabis at all. That may, might put a kibosh on some of our plans,
[19:08.400 --> 19:13.600]  but more locally, what Jesse is talking about, we have amendment 200 and amendment 300 here in
[19:13.600 --> 19:19.760]  Pueblo, Colorado. If those pass the marijuana industry in Pueblo, Colorado will be forced to
[19:19.760 --> 19:25.920]  shut down in 2017. They get a full year to, to keep going. But after that it's over.
[19:25.920 --> 19:30.480]  And so no new licenses. So like these people, even though they have a license, they've never
[19:30.480 --> 19:39.120]  grown before. So, and, and it's kind of a change of location for him too. So they wouldn't under
[19:39.120 --> 19:44.960]  the new proposal, they wouldn't be able to let it happen. Yeah. Good luck. I hope every you guys,
[19:44.960 --> 19:48.080]  uh, it's probably going to be too late by the time this episode comes out. I hope you voted,
[19:48.080 --> 19:53.120]  please. And I want to give a huge shout out to Mike, uh, to white Mike, to Nemo punk,
[19:53.120 --> 19:57.120]  everything he's done, man. Yeah. He's been putting huge efforts in for the no one 50,
[19:57.120 --> 20:02.160]  no one 200 campaign, the no on 300 campaign. He did more groundwork than anybody else. I saw
[20:02.160 --> 20:05.360]  shout out to everybody else that participated. I know I'm giving Mike all the credit. I know
[20:05.360 --> 20:09.280]  there's a bunch of you, but Mike is a person that led it in my eye. I know there are more of you,
[20:09.280 --> 20:13.520]  but Mike is one of my best friends. I saw him doing it. He owes a huge shout out. I can name
[20:13.520 --> 20:18.320]  a few more names, but I can't name them all. So, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's, there's a couple
[20:18.320 --> 20:21.520]  of people I know that deserve a shout out, but I don't exactly know their names, but I know they're
[20:21.520 --> 20:25.200]  on Mike's team. So Mike spread the love, let them know they're getting shout outs from the podcast.
[20:25.200 --> 20:27.840]  Thanks for what you do, bro. We're going to get you on a podcast here in a couple of days.
[20:28.720 --> 20:30.720]  You can't, you can't be on every damn show.
[20:32.720 --> 20:36.080]  Shout out to white Mike and the family. Hope you guys are having fun on the couch this evening.
[20:36.080 --> 20:41.360]  Nice. It's a warm fall Saturday evening. It's so warm. It's like 80 degrees in my house because
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.200]  we expected winter to come. I covered up my swamp cooler so that it would,
[20:45.200 --> 20:47.920]  cause it was cold the other night. The air was coming in there and freezing me when I was trying
[20:47.920 --> 20:52.880]  to watch Narcos. Uh, that's an excellent show, man. I hate the way it ended. I was like, no,
[20:52.880 --> 20:56.560]  be more. Oh no, there will be. Yeah. There's, yeah. They're going to do a Cali cartel,
[20:56.560 --> 21:02.240]  which isn't nearly as exciting, but it'll still be pretty good. I wasn't, I had an attachment to
[21:02.240 --> 21:08.960]  that show. 20 episodes was not enough. I love anything. Drug smuggling culture. I just eat it
[21:08.960 --> 21:15.520]  up. I've read a few books. I've watched every documentary. I mean, it's yeah. The dude, uh,
[21:16.080 --> 21:22.240]  the big Lebowski will be at a, uh, the chronic con in Colorado here coming up pretty soon.
[21:22.880 --> 21:28.560]  Go meet him and take your picture with them. Smoke a J with the dude. Do a J do a J with the
[21:28.560 --> 21:33.040]  dude. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So let's get a little bit back. I don't think we finished up
[21:33.040 --> 21:38.640]  talking about cleaning up the garden. Um, so we've got a top draft or kind of reamended for next year.
[21:38.640 --> 21:43.840]  We filled it with some kelp and some alfalfa meal. And then when it comes time for season,
[21:43.840 --> 21:47.600]  we're going to dig a little hole and we're going to put some micro rises in there. Some more kelp,
[21:47.600 --> 21:52.400]  some more alfalfa, maybe some crab meal. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, maybe some worm castings. Oh yeah.
[21:52.400 --> 21:57.280]  Okay. Or just worms themselves. Worms themselves. Yeah. You guys get the worms going. The worms are
[21:57.280 --> 22:02.320]  so good for the environment. If you've got the compost pile, you know, by all means use it up.
[22:02.320 --> 22:06.160]  So put that, yeah, put that in there, put that in your holes so that that sounds so gross,
[22:06.160 --> 22:10.160]  but then in the holes where you're planting your plants so that all that compost, that rich compost
[22:10.160 --> 22:14.800]  can feed those plants. Even if you're sorry to cut you off. No, go for it. Even if you're grown
[22:14.800 --> 22:20.880]  in pots, you can still utilize that, that compost. Even if you're using salt-based chemical nutrients,
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.680]  you can still utilize that compost. Yes. I love the trend that I'm seeing on Instagram and social
[22:25.680 --> 22:30.800]  media and even the forums of people that are recycling soil and running no-till and you're
[22:30.800 --> 22:36.480]  seeing them top dress and decorate their plants to keep like a layer in there to where they can
[22:36.480 --> 22:40.880]  keep the moisture in and they're putting stuff like alfalfa sprouts and other sprouts on top of
[22:40.880 --> 22:45.680]  there. And I'm loving the way that it looks in a nice indoor garden with these, this other growth
[22:45.680 --> 22:49.680]  on top of your plant, you get a little, little ecosphere on top of your plant there. And then
[22:49.680 --> 22:53.040]  you got a pot plant growing out of it and that little shit that's growing out of it is dying
[22:53.040 --> 22:58.080]  and actually feeding your plant. It's such a, it's such a neat little thing to learn and see happen.
[22:58.080 --> 23:03.200]  It's like a miniature environment. Yeah. Is that permaculture? Is that the word I'm looking for?
[23:03.200 --> 23:11.600]  No, that'd be no-till, which is a permaculture value, but permaculture is hard to wrangle into
[23:11.600 --> 23:19.440]  one definition. It's just a way of looking at things. I learned something today. All right.
[23:19.440 --> 23:23.120]  So we've got our plants. So now we're still at the end of the season. Let's keep ourselves kind
[23:23.120 --> 23:25.920]  of on track. We're at the end of the season. We've cleaned up, we've got our compost pile,
[23:25.920 --> 23:29.760]  everything's chipped up, everything's covered. We put some stuff where the old plants were. Now,
[23:29.760 --> 23:36.880]  what should we focus on other than that? Cleaning up your trash. Inevitable. Every
[23:36.880 --> 23:43.600]  grow's got a little bit, whether it's beer bottles or old netting. Dr. Pepper bottles.
[23:43.600 --> 23:48.480]  Yeah. Zigzag wrappers. Yeah. Get all that shit cleaned up. It looks bad.
[23:50.080 --> 23:55.280]  Get your cages put away. If you use those, if you're netting or whatever, get that all put up.
[23:56.240 --> 24:02.000]  Any kind of shade cloth. If you want to reuse it next year, you need to store it away and get it
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.520]  out of the weather. Same with your water barrels, your air pumps, any kind of liquid nutrients you
[24:07.520 --> 24:13.440]  had outside. You need to get all that inside and in a warm place. And don't bring it inside to your
[24:13.440 --> 24:18.000]  grow area. Yeah. Don't do that. Don't bring the bugs and mildew into your garden. Put it in the
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.600]  shed outside. Clean it. If you can, take some time and clean it. Just polish it up. If you had a fan
[24:23.600 --> 24:29.440]  or something outside, take it apart, clean it, please clean it with some H2O2 or some of that.
[24:29.440 --> 24:33.120]  I think it's the same thing, but the 30% hydrogen peroxide, clean it with some of that. That thing
[24:33.120 --> 24:38.560]  will clean everything. Same thing. Wear gloves, you guys. Or even like enzymes complete or
[24:38.560 --> 24:43.280]  hygrazine or something. Or some of the bokashi juice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just clean your stuff up.
[24:43.280 --> 24:48.480]  Be creative. Use what's at your disposal. Dr. Bonner soap. I mean, some of that was some
[24:48.800 --> 24:54.080]  like, was like some pine oil or something like that. And it wouldn't, that's going to kill
[24:54.080 --> 24:59.120]  anything. So, you know, yeah. I like the Dr. Bronner's. Yeah. I love that shit.
[25:00.160 --> 25:04.480]  Wash my dreads with it. You can wash everything with it. Yeah. It's perfect. All right. So clean
[25:04.480 --> 25:07.520]  up, get out there and clean everything up. Take all the equipment out of there. Make it look like
[25:07.520 --> 25:15.280]  there was never a grow there. Yeah. Okay. If you're, if you grow in pots and you want to reuse
[25:15.280 --> 25:19.520]  all your soil, even if you're not, if you grow in pots and you're not reusing your soil,
[25:19.520 --> 25:25.280]  throw it away. Like, you know, it's just, if you had any issues, they're still lingering there.
[25:25.280 --> 25:30.640]  You know, if you are going to reuse it, get it all in a pile, get it wet, cover it with plastic.
[25:30.640 --> 25:35.520]  It's the same principle we were talking about with covering the, with the raised beds and
[25:35.520 --> 25:42.320]  everything. So, you know, if we had some fungus gnats or powdery mildew, is that going to be
[25:42.880 --> 25:46.320]  kind of destroyed in the composting process or is that going to compound?
[25:47.200 --> 25:52.640]  Fungus gnats. If you get it heated, if you get the pile heated up enough, which means you've got to
[25:52.640 --> 25:58.720]  add a considerable amount of raw green material and just organic matter to it for it to heat back
[25:58.720 --> 26:04.480]  up. It will most definitely kill the fungus gnats. Okay. Powdery mildew. I have no idea.
[26:04.480 --> 26:08.960]  Okay. Now we might, we might be killing ourselves trying to do both. Cause I think if you put the
[26:08.960 --> 26:13.440]  green in there, the PM will grow on the green, but I don't think the PM can grow on things that
[26:13.440 --> 26:18.160]  are not leafy. For sure. Well, I mean, green matter could even be, or like green manure.
[26:18.160 --> 26:24.640]  I mean, it could be cow shit. It could be anything that's going to heat up. Grass clippings. If you
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.680]  feel safe using that. Old pot leaves. Old pot leaves. Yeah. So, I mean. Chicken poop. Yeah.
[26:29.680 --> 26:33.040]  Oh yeah. Chicken poop is just such a great amendment. And I know it's funny that I say
[26:33.040 --> 26:37.120]  that because I'm a vegetarian and I don't even eat the chickens, but I've noticed that when chicken
[26:37.120 --> 26:41.760]  poop goes into a compost, goes into plants that really does something. And then seabird poop also,
[26:42.400 --> 26:45.920]  any sort of seabird poop, anything from the sea is really, really rich.
[26:46.720 --> 26:51.840]  I love the way sea stuff grows. Yeah. That's why that California Kush smells so good.
[26:51.840 --> 26:57.680]  Sea Gannix. If I ever had to label the way I like to grow, you know, that's Sea Gannix.
[26:57.680 --> 27:00.240]  Do you want me to edit that out to know that nobody steals that? Cause that's,
[27:00.240 --> 27:01.760]  that might be a phrase you want to.
[27:01.760 --> 27:05.840]  No, because there may be someone on the coast that's like way more worthy of
[27:05.840 --> 27:07.440]  using that. I'm not worried about it.
[27:07.440 --> 27:10.960]  All right guys. Some grower on the coast that wants to make some, uh, sea based.
[27:10.960 --> 27:13.760]  But you better be getting like your own kelp and your own bird shit.
[27:14.800 --> 27:16.480]  Swim out to the ocean with some buckets.
[27:16.480 --> 27:17.040]  Impress me.
[27:17.760 --> 27:21.120]  That's probably illegal as fuck. Don't do that. Don't don't. You did not hear that here on the
[27:21.120 --> 27:21.520]  podcast.
[27:21.520 --> 27:24.240]  Oh man. There's kelp laying all over the beach in Oregon.
[27:24.240 --> 27:26.800]  Yeah. You're probably going to get in trouble if you collect it.
[27:26.800 --> 27:27.440]  I don't think so.
[27:27.440 --> 27:28.080]  It's Oregon.
[27:28.080 --> 27:28.880]  It stinks.
[27:28.880 --> 27:29.360]  Okay.
[27:29.360 --> 27:31.600]  Yeah. I'm pretty sure people wouldn't mind.
[27:31.600 --> 27:34.720]  Get it, put it in some bottles and ship the first tester batches to Jesse.
[27:36.480 --> 27:38.000]  Rinse all the salt off first, please.
[27:39.680 --> 27:40.000]  Please.
[27:42.400 --> 27:45.120]  I could just see the plants just brought to me.
[27:45.120 --> 27:46.560]  Oh yeah. I forgot to rinse the kelp.
[27:47.280 --> 27:47.600]  Oops.
[27:48.640 --> 27:51.280]  All right. We are way off topic, but we are still on topic.
[27:51.280 --> 27:52.400]  It's amazing how we do it.
[27:53.200 --> 27:56.080]  This is something I deal with every year and I fucking did it this year.
[27:57.280 --> 28:00.320]  Clean out your, your outdoor spray bottles.
[28:00.320 --> 28:05.680]  Cause like mine have teas go through it, which has a lot of molasses and they always clog up.
[28:06.240 --> 28:09.440]  And then in the spring, I'm just like, mother fucker and end up throwing it away and going
[28:09.440 --> 28:10.080]  and getting a new one.
[28:10.080 --> 28:11.200]  You pump it and you go to spray it.
[28:12.400 --> 28:17.040]  I cleaned them all out with super hot water this year and good to go for next year.
[28:17.040 --> 28:20.640]  You guys buy the pump sprayers that have the nozzle on it, where you can release the pressure
[28:21.520 --> 28:24.880]  with the, you want to be able to release that pressure because otherwise you'll pump it up
[28:24.880 --> 28:27.520]  real hard and the fucking, the nozzle gets stuck.
[28:27.520 --> 28:28.880]  You'll never get it off of there.
[28:28.880 --> 28:29.920]  And now you can't refill it.
[28:29.920 --> 28:33.280]  And you got to just throw it away because you'll try to pop it open with something.
[28:33.280 --> 28:33.920]  You're just going to break it.
[28:33.920 --> 28:37.680]  Some of the plastic somewhere will spin or trust me, get the ones with the kind of the
[28:37.680 --> 28:39.360]  type that have the pressure release valve.
[28:39.360 --> 28:42.800]  So you can, once it's pumped up and pressurized, you can take that pressure off.
[28:42.800 --> 28:47.920]  It's really scary trying to undo it when you got like, yeah, neem oil in there and you
[28:47.920 --> 28:49.360]  don't want it to spray up in your face.
[28:49.920 --> 28:55.040]  I saw that happen with someone that had a tank full of four of my ones, like a backpack tank.
[28:55.840 --> 28:59.120]  They're pumping it and pumping it and they didn't have the lid screwed on all the way.
[28:59.280 --> 28:59.780]  Right.
[29:01.280 --> 29:01.680]  Yeah.
[29:01.680 --> 29:04.720]  That was back before anyone.
[29:04.720 --> 29:07.120]  Well, lots of people knew better, but we didn't.
[29:07.120 --> 29:07.680]  Yeah.
[29:07.680 --> 29:09.840]  Back before we knew that floor might, was it no go?
[29:10.400 --> 29:10.640]  Yeah.
[29:10.640 --> 29:14.080]  You guys, if you got to do something, if you get a brand new clone and it came from somebody
[29:14.080 --> 29:18.400]  and you really, really want it, but it might have something hit it if you need to, but
[29:18.400 --> 29:20.400]  mother that out and take clones from that.
[29:20.400 --> 29:20.880]  Yeah.
[29:20.880 --> 29:24.800]  Don't go smoking the floor of my added one, at least try to get a generation from there.
[29:24.800 --> 29:25.040]  All right.
[29:25.040 --> 29:26.560]  So we've cleaned up everything we've got.
[29:27.040 --> 29:30.240]  Uh, we want to cover up the holes for the area for next year.
[29:30.240 --> 29:31.680]  Do you just want to leave it exposed?
[29:31.680 --> 29:32.800]  Uh, you want that covered up?
[29:32.800 --> 29:33.040]  Okay.
[29:33.040 --> 29:36.560]  Cover that up so that all the stuff can process in there, get some heat in there.
[29:36.560 --> 29:38.160]  You got your compost pile going.
[29:38.160 --> 29:39.440]  We got everything cleaned up.
[29:39.440 --> 29:42.400]  It doesn't even look like a girl happened in that yard or that field anymore.
[29:42.400 --> 29:42.800]  Right.
[29:42.800 --> 29:43.200]  Yeah.
[29:43.200 --> 29:44.640]  Just make it look nice and good.
[29:44.640 --> 29:45.040]  Yeah.
[29:45.040 --> 29:48.080]  And it's all, it's a clean slate for you to go back next year.
[29:48.080 --> 29:51.600]  And then as soon as the snow melts and you're thinking about growing, the next thing to
[29:51.600 --> 29:55.840]  do is go out there and fix all of the holes in your fences and go check that fence.
[29:55.840 --> 29:57.760]  Go make sure that that thing is super secure.
[29:57.760 --> 29:59.760]  Go pick up all of the dog shit.
[29:59.760 --> 30:02.640]  I'm sure your dog or one of your buddy's dogs have been out there dropping deuces.
[30:03.200 --> 30:03.920]  Go pick that up.
[30:03.920 --> 30:07.360]  That's you don't want all the flies coming around because the dog poop out there.
[30:07.360 --> 30:09.280]  As soon as it gets warm, that's the stuff you got to do.
[30:09.840 --> 30:15.680]  Then, uh, I mean, depending on how serious you get, um, I actually, I know of a couple
[30:15.680 --> 30:18.640]  of people that are already growing their plants for next season.
[30:19.440 --> 30:27.680]  Um, but you know, if you're a small, you know, 25, 35 plant or less outdoor grow, you
[30:27.680 --> 30:31.840]  can get away with, uh, you know, you can start your plants in February, probably.
[30:31.840 --> 30:35.920]  Um, if you're growing from seed and you want to do a phenol selection, I suggest starting
[30:35.920 --> 30:41.680]  now, but if you're growing from clones, uh, you know, February, you can start, you know,
[30:41.680 --> 30:43.520]  start them up if you're going for trees.
[30:43.520 --> 30:43.680]  So.
[30:44.640 --> 30:45.760]  Start them up, get them huge.
[30:46.080 --> 30:49.920]  Don't let them get root bound ever, ever, ever.
[30:49.920 --> 30:51.440]  Cause they will start to flower on you.
[30:51.440 --> 30:52.400]  They will start flowering.
[30:52.400 --> 30:55.200]  So veggie inside, get them big, top them, get them loved.
[30:55.200 --> 30:56.560]  Don't let them get root bound.
[30:56.560 --> 30:58.000]  Keep them pest free.
[30:58.000 --> 30:58.480]  Don't run.
[30:58.480 --> 30:58.720]  Yeah.
[30:58.720 --> 30:59.760]  Keep them pest free.
[30:59.760 --> 31:04.640]  Do not run them on a 24 hour light unless you plan on putting them outside underneath
[31:04.640 --> 31:05.600]  a 24 hour light.
[31:06.240 --> 31:07.600]  See, I would have never thought of that.
[31:07.600 --> 31:08.080]  Yeah.
[31:08.080 --> 31:08.800]  Yeah.
[31:08.800 --> 31:13.040]  I mean, if you got a hoop house and you can run a little, all it takes is like just a
[31:13.040 --> 31:14.240]  little fluorescent, right?
[31:14.240 --> 31:15.760]  If you can do that, sure.
[31:15.760 --> 31:16.800]  Go for 24.
[31:16.800 --> 31:23.120]  But in my experience, running them 24 and then putting them outside, um, under not 24
[31:23.120 --> 31:27.600]  is it just, it either stunts them out sativas, it'll throw them into bloom.
[31:28.240 --> 31:31.360]  Um, or I mean, Indica's it'll throw them into bloom.
[31:31.360 --> 31:36.400]  Uh, you know, so just, and then, then you get two weeks of going into bloom and then
[31:36.400 --> 31:39.840]  going back into veg and then vegging and then going back into flower.
[31:39.840 --> 31:42.080]  And then you got plants that just look like hell and they're mad.
[31:42.080 --> 31:46.960]  And you have a very funky looking plant this season and your trimmers hate you.
[31:46.960 --> 31:50.560]  Maybe some seeds, maybe some seeds, man.
[31:51.600 --> 31:54.560]  Is there anything else that we should mention when it comes to cleaning up your garden at
[31:54.560 --> 31:57.520]  the end of the season to prepare for the winter and the next year?
[31:58.080 --> 32:00.160]  Um, nothing major.
[32:00.160 --> 32:05.440]  If you have locks on gates or something like that, uh, put them inside unless they need
[32:05.440 --> 32:08.880]  to be out there, but it just keeps them from at least around here.
[32:08.880 --> 32:11.440]  It keeps them from getting arrested up and crap like that.
[32:11.440 --> 32:16.480]  So just a lot of the things I do is so that I don't have to spend money on it the next
[32:16.480 --> 32:16.720]  year.
[32:17.280 --> 32:22.240]  And so that my tools last all summer, you know, first several years, not just one season
[32:22.240 --> 32:23.200]  at a time.
[32:23.200 --> 32:26.640]  So I think a lot of that comes with age or getting older for sure.
[32:26.640 --> 32:28.640]  We're getting tired of buying the same damn hammer.
[32:30.240 --> 32:31.440]  Where did I put that?
[32:31.440 --> 32:32.960]  I left it out somewhere.
[32:33.840 --> 32:34.400]  Yeah.
[32:34.400 --> 32:37.040]  Now you get that shit and put it away, especially around here.
[32:37.040 --> 32:39.280]  Cause if you leave it somewhere, it's fucking gone.
[32:39.280 --> 32:39.520]  Yeah.
[32:39.520 --> 32:40.480]  You don't get a chance.
[32:40.560 --> 32:40.720]  Yeah.
[32:41.600 --> 32:45.280]  It could be, they'll almost take the shit out of your hand if you blink long enough.
[32:46.160 --> 32:49.520]  Sorry, I did not mean to bash this town, but fuck dude, drugs are bad.
[32:49.520 --> 32:50.080]  I'm okay.
[32:50.080 --> 32:50.320]  Yeah.
[32:50.320 --> 32:51.520]  Drugs are real bad.
[32:51.520 --> 32:53.600]  And the town North of us has the other drug.
[32:53.600 --> 32:55.920]  We got the drug that makes you go real slow and sleepy.
[32:55.920 --> 32:58.720]  And then up North, they got the ones that are making you go real fast.
[32:58.720 --> 33:01.040]  So it's just fucking ridiculous all over the place lately.
[33:01.040 --> 33:02.640]  Everyone's fucking flipping out.
[33:03.200 --> 33:05.040]  Oh man, that looks like such a good idea.
[33:05.040 --> 33:07.680]  You guys, Jesse's taking a big fat dab of some Durban poison.
[33:08.240 --> 33:09.120]  Oh, you hear that?
[33:09.120 --> 33:09.440]  Yeah.
[33:09.440 --> 33:10.960]  Shout out to pass the rock in the email.
[33:11.680 --> 33:12.240]  There you go.
[33:12.240 --> 33:12.800]  Cough it up.
[33:13.760 --> 33:15.840]  He has, it sounds like it's my turn to take a dab.
[33:15.840 --> 33:17.920]  Um, Jesse, do you have any final words to the podcast?
[33:17.920 --> 33:20.240]  You want to put out to the listeners before we wrap it up?
[33:20.240 --> 33:24.880]  Um, shout out to one love garden supply.
[33:24.880 --> 33:29.520]  Come check us out, Denver or, um, boulders Pueblo.
[33:30.240 --> 33:32.960]  Um, you just took a big dab and then I put them on the spot.
[33:32.960 --> 33:34.160]  My fault, my fault.
[33:34.160 --> 33:37.120]  A shout out to the awesome people in Oregon.
[33:37.120 --> 33:38.640]  Oh, that's something I meant to tell you.
[33:38.640 --> 33:41.440]  Customer service out there is ridiculous.
[33:41.440 --> 33:42.880]  They are so nice.
[33:42.880 --> 33:43.440]  Really?
[33:43.440 --> 33:44.160]  It's yeah.
[33:44.160 --> 33:47.120]  They don't seem like they're mad at you for wanting a sandwich at the sandwich place.
[33:47.120 --> 33:47.920]  No, not at all.
[33:47.920 --> 33:49.120]  They're actually glad to see you.
[33:49.120 --> 33:49.920]  That's pretty rad.
[33:49.920 --> 33:52.000]  Even in super small little Podunk towns.
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.360]  Like is the, every time we had a great customer service experience out there,
[33:57.360 --> 34:00.560]  I would think of your rants on Facebook about how horrible,
[34:00.560 --> 34:02.080]  and I'm like, you know, he's fucking right.
[34:02.080 --> 34:02.640]  Yeah.
[34:02.640 --> 34:05.600]  When you go somewhere that actually they're like, Hey, welcome to our establishment
[34:05.600 --> 34:07.120]  where you're going to pay our wages.
[34:07.120 --> 34:08.080]  Can we help you properly?
[34:08.080 --> 34:08.560]  Yeah.
[34:08.560 --> 34:09.120]  Like, oh shit.
[34:09.120 --> 34:10.240]  They know about service here.
[34:10.880 --> 34:11.200]  Yeah.
[34:11.200 --> 34:11.520]  Awesome.
[34:11.520 --> 34:12.800]  Well, I'm glad you got taken well care of.
[34:12.800 --> 34:14.560]  Shout out to all the nice people on the coast.
[34:14.560 --> 34:15.120]  For sure.
[34:15.120 --> 34:17.440]  It was an awesome, awesome experience.
[34:17.440 --> 34:18.080]  That's rad.
[34:18.080 --> 34:19.280]  Shout out to your wife.
[34:19.280 --> 34:21.520]  Shout out to your wife for, uh, for letting you go on that adventure.
[34:21.520 --> 34:24.000]  And for also hooking me up every time I go to the growth store,
[34:24.000 --> 34:25.200]  she takes really good care of me.
[34:25.200 --> 34:25.840]  Fuck yeah.
[34:25.840 --> 34:27.920]  I can send her a Facebook message and let her know what I need.
[34:27.920 --> 34:30.320]  And when I get there, it's on the damn counter waiting for me.
[34:30.320 --> 34:31.440]  She makes life very easy.
[34:31.440 --> 34:32.240]  So shout out to burn.
[34:32.240 --> 34:33.120]  I appreciate that.
[34:33.120 --> 34:34.240]  That's some customer service.

[36:09.280 --> 36:11.920]  I think I ran out of breath trying to do all the plugs at the end.
[36:11.920 --> 36:16.240]  Make sure you go give garden to weed and 2.0 a follow to.
[36:16.240 --> 36:16.560]  Oh yeah.
[36:16.560 --> 36:18.960]  The Instagram police have been shutting people down.
[36:18.960 --> 36:19.360]  So good.
[36:19.360 --> 36:20.800]  Follow garden of weed and 2.0.
[36:20.800 --> 36:22.080]  That's Spence and Maddie.
[36:22.080 --> 36:23.920]  That's a perfect way to end the podcast.
[36:23.920 --> 36:25.520]  I'm gonna give a huge shout out to Maddie and Spence.
[36:26.240 --> 36:29.760]  Until next time, take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
[36:37.460 --> 37:30.910]  We are, we are all made even.
[37:30.910 --> 37:46.940]  Recognize it, if it came, would you recognize it?
[37:46.940 --> 38:34.590]  We are all made even.
[38:34.590 --> 38:41.880]  Would you recognize it?
[38:42.440 --> 39:51.990]  If it came to you, they came speeding like a boat.
[39:51.990 --> 43:42.400]  Would you recognize it?
[43:42.400 --> 43:57.090]  If it jumped up and hit you on the ass.
[43:57.090 --> 43:58.090]  Would you recognize it?
