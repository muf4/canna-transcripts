[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Welcome to the show everybody! It's time for episode 352 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.000 --> 00:10.000]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:10.000 --> 00:18.000]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:18.000 --> 00:23.000]  You guys know I like to start the show off by keeping you updated on what I've been dabbing on.
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.000]  Today I'm taking dabs of Durban Kush sauce from Contraband Concentrates.
[00:28.000 --> 00:36.000]  This is labeled as Durban Poison and I-95, cross to pre-98 Bubba Kush. I don't know if that's a blend or if that's actually a cross.
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000]  It is labeled as sweet and sour. It is a cut above bread, selected and grown.
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.000]  This is really delicious concentrate. It kind of gives you that mind eraser sort of a thing. You go blink for a few minutes.
[00:47.000 --> 00:50.000]  It got Mike ridiculously high earlier today.
[00:50.000 --> 00:59.000]  There is a lab test printed on the container. It says THC A 902.9 milligrams, which equals 90.3%.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  The THC is 21.43 milligrams, which equals 2.1%.
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.000]  And there are no other cannabinoids detected.
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  The Durban Kush sauce from Contraband Concentrates, it's got me lit up.
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  I really like this energetic, talkative buzz. This should be a fun podcast.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  This episode will be the second in a series of grow lessons.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  It will take us from the beginning of a grow all the way up to harvest and drying and curing our product.
[01:26.000 --> 01:33.000]  In the last episode, we talked a little bit about planning our grow and setting goals and finding ways to stay out of trouble.
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  In this episode, we're going to focus more on planning the specific grow space.
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  I've got a lot of details written down for this episode, so I'm going to press pause.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  I'm going to take a quick drink. Of course, I'm going to take a bunch more dabs.
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  And when I come back, we'll take a deep dive into selecting and planning your grow space.
[02:01.350 --> 02:06.350]  All right, Podcast World, I am back and I am ready to talk about selecting your grow space.
[02:06.350 --> 02:08.350]  Let's get right into it.
[02:08.350 --> 02:14.350]  You can set up a grow almost anywhere if you can supply electricity, airflow, and water to that space.
[02:14.350 --> 02:18.350]  Where you choose to grow is going to determine a lot of your setup.
[02:18.350 --> 02:20.350]  We talked about this in the last episode.
[02:20.350 --> 02:26.350]  If you're in a small closet, you'll be very limited, but you'll still be able to produce a usable product.
[02:26.350 --> 02:31.350]  If you're in a prohibition state, you'll need to take extra precautions to keep the aroma down.
[02:31.350 --> 02:36.350]  And also, you'll need an excuse for the extra electrical consumption.
[02:37.350 --> 02:44.350]  Let me make a quick disclaimer that I cannot endorse, encourage, or promote you to conduct any sort of illegal activity.
[02:44.350 --> 02:48.350]  You've got to follow the laws and obey all of the rules.
[02:48.350 --> 02:59.350]  If you didn't listen to the last episode, please go back and listen to that long, passionate rant I gave about what will happen to you if you are suspected of having an illegal grow in your home.
[03:00.350 --> 03:01.350]  Now let's keep going.
[03:01.350 --> 03:08.350]  I recommend everyone do your best to minimize odor and obvious signs of a grow, even in legal environments.
[03:08.350 --> 03:15.350]  Thieves know how to spot a grow, and you're entering a gray area that until recently has been run by criminals.
[03:15.350 --> 03:19.350]  You're planning to produce a high-value product, and people want that product.
[03:19.350 --> 03:24.350]  If you tell somebody about that product, you are asking for trouble, so be careful.
[03:24.350 --> 03:27.350]  In the last episode, I talked about not bragging.
[03:27.350 --> 03:31.350]  Keep yourself protected by keeping your mouth shut.
[03:31.350 --> 03:34.350]  Now let's talk more about places to grow.
[03:34.350 --> 03:35.350]  We can grow in closets.
[03:35.350 --> 03:37.350]  We can grow in pre-made tents.
[03:37.350 --> 03:38.350]  We can grow in bedrooms.
[03:38.350 --> 03:40.350]  We can set up giant areas in basements.
[03:40.350 --> 03:44.350]  And we can even use tiny spaces like our friends Love for the Plant and Love for the Bonk.
[03:44.350 --> 03:46.350]  They grow in little micro-grows.
[03:46.350 --> 03:56.350]  The size of your space and the pre-existing structure will dictate most of your setup, especially in a rental home and even more so in a prohibition environment.
[03:56.350 --> 04:04.350]  If you own your home, or if you're busting out the barn, or if you're building out a warehouse in a legal area, you have much more options.
[04:05.350 --> 04:11.350]  Ideal spaces for a grow are generally places with low traffic and something you can keep hidden from visitors.
[04:11.350 --> 04:13.350]  I like basements for home grows.
[04:13.350 --> 04:17.350]  Attics are okay, but they're harder to keep the climate dialed in.
[04:17.350 --> 04:24.350]  The sun is beating right on top of your grow space, and the home heat rises, so attics are generally warmer places.
[04:24.350 --> 04:30.350]  Maybe my East Coast friends would have better luck in the attic, while the Colorado crew will get down in the basement better.
[04:31.350 --> 04:35.350]  Basements are usually insulated by the earth, so the temperature stays fairly cool.
[04:35.350 --> 04:41.350]  If you can isolate a small section or a room in the basement, that is usually my first choice.
[04:41.350 --> 04:46.350]  People won't be down in your basement unless you invite them, so it's easier to keep it secure.
[04:46.350 --> 04:57.350]  Now the only issue with basements is when you have to have a contractor come fix the water heater or the heater or some sort of plumbing down there, you may need to be prepared for visitors.
[04:58.350 --> 05:01.350]  Basements and attics are ideal in my opinion.
[05:01.350 --> 05:05.350]  Spare bedrooms are great if you have good control of your home.
[05:05.350 --> 05:13.350]  If you live with other people, you have to make sure that everyone is on the same page with the importance of security and light control in your grow rooms.
[05:13.350 --> 05:24.350]  If you live with other people and you've got a grow room and a spare bedroom, there's a good chance that when you're gone, when you're on a date, when you're asleep, they're going to take somebody in there and show off your grow, and they're going to do something weird.
[05:24.350 --> 05:26.350]  They're going to turn on the light during the night cycle.
[05:26.350 --> 05:29.350]  They're going to leave the overhead light on and not think about the light.
[05:29.350 --> 05:33.350]  The normal room light, when the grow lights go off, that normal light will stay on.
[05:33.350 --> 05:34.350]  They're going to screw it up.
[05:34.350 --> 05:42.350]  So have everybody in the house on the same page if you set up a grow in a shared home, in a shared room with other folks.
[05:42.350 --> 05:44.350]  So be careful with that sort of stuff.
[05:45.350 --> 05:50.350]  Another thing to think about is keeping children out of the grow without supervision.
[05:51.350 --> 05:53.350]  If you let your kids help, that's up to you as a parent.
[05:53.350 --> 05:54.350]  That's up to you as a caregiver.
[05:54.350 --> 05:55.350]  Maybe you're growing for the child.
[05:55.350 --> 06:00.350]  I think if you're growing for a child, it's great to have that child go in there and help with their medicine.
[06:00.350 --> 06:02.350]  They can build a relationship with it.
[06:02.350 --> 06:03.350]  I think that is a beautiful thing.
[06:03.350 --> 06:05.350]  That's up to you as a parent.
[06:05.350 --> 06:07.350]  You parent the way you feel you should do it.
[06:07.350 --> 06:11.350]  But keep the grow room locked and keep the kids out without supervision.
[06:11.350 --> 06:15.350]  I'd recommend a lock anyway just to make law enforcement happy.
[06:15.350 --> 06:21.350]  If anyone does come to inspect your legal grow, a lock just makes you look like you're trying to be more responsible.
[06:21.350 --> 06:22.350]  It looks good.
[06:22.350 --> 06:24.350]  It's an easy step to take.
[06:24.350 --> 06:25.350]  Do that.
[06:26.350 --> 06:29.350]  Garages and outbuildings are also great places for grows.
[06:29.350 --> 06:36.350]  Any space in which you can control the lights, the temperature, and humidity, you can turn into a grow.
[06:36.350 --> 06:42.350]  If you have a large space and you can't control the large area, you can buy a grow tent of almost any size
[06:42.350 --> 06:46.350]  and set that up in a room to create a more controllable environment.
[06:46.350 --> 06:52.350]  You can also set up multiple tents to have multiple cycles in the same basement or room area.
[06:52.350 --> 07:00.350]  You can have a veg area and two tents with alternating flower cycles to maximize the productivity of a basement grow.
[07:00.350 --> 07:04.350]  It's all about maximization once you get your rooms dialed in.
[07:04.350 --> 07:10.350]  You can maximize a closet or a cabinet or a warehouse if you set it up correctly.
[07:10.350 --> 07:13.350]  Be sure to keep safety and security in mind.
[07:13.350 --> 07:15.350]  Is your new grow option safe?
[07:15.350 --> 07:16.350]  Is it secure?
[07:16.350 --> 07:21.350]  And once again, can you handle the consequences if you get yourself into trouble?
[07:21.350 --> 07:24.350]  Think about that now before we jump in.
[07:24.350 --> 07:28.350]  No matter where you set up your grow, there are a few things to keep in mind.
[07:28.350 --> 07:34.350]  The thing I feel is most commonly overlooked is the importance of airflow and air exchange.
[07:34.350 --> 07:37.350]  We need to exchange the air in a grow room.
[07:38.350 --> 07:47.350]  Imagine if I stuck you in a closet for 24 hours and I didn't open the door for any fresh air or to let out any of the gases that came from you.
[07:47.350 --> 07:54.350]  You'd be alive and you'd be a little uncomfortable and the air in that room would be so stale and funky that you just couldn't wait to get out.
[07:54.350 --> 07:56.350]  You'd be ready for some fresh air.
[07:56.350 --> 07:58.350]  The plants feel the same way.
[07:58.350 --> 08:01.350]  Plants uptake CO2 and release oxygen.
[08:01.350 --> 08:05.350]  So we have to think about where we're getting fresh CO2 from.
[08:05.350 --> 08:11.350]  And as the plants function, they release water vapor that increases the relative humidity of our grow space.
[08:11.350 --> 08:16.350]  So we have to have a plan to get rid of that excess humidity.
[08:16.350 --> 08:20.350]  Now as we remove the old air, we need to replace it with fresh air.
[08:20.350 --> 08:26.350]  In most small grows, you'll be able to replace the air probably with just the airflow that flows from underneath the door.
[08:26.350 --> 08:33.350]  If you've got a closet grow or a very small bedroom grow, you'll get enough air coming in through passive vents like underneath the door.
[08:33.350 --> 08:37.350]  Most of your grow tents will have passive vents built into the bottom.
[08:37.350 --> 08:39.350]  Utilize those.
[08:39.350 --> 08:44.350]  If you're using a powerful enough blower to extract the warm human air from the top of a grow space,
[08:44.350 --> 08:51.350]  you may need to add a passive intake to allow enough fresh air to flow into your space.
[08:51.350 --> 08:54.350]  So the major consideration is airflow.
[08:54.350 --> 08:57.350]  Can you get air in and out of your grow space?
[08:58.350 --> 09:01.350]  Don't plan on leaving the door open as part of your plan.
[09:01.350 --> 09:03.350]  Because what about the dark cycle?
[09:03.350 --> 09:06.350]  You can't leave the door open during the dark cycle.
[09:06.350 --> 09:09.350]  And also what about those days when you're not home?
[09:09.350 --> 09:12.350]  Or what about that night when you get too stoned and fall asleep and forget?
[09:12.350 --> 09:17.350]  Don't rely on just leaving the door open as part of your HVAC plan.
[09:17.350 --> 09:19.350]  That is not going to work.
[09:19.350 --> 09:21.350]  That is not sufficient.
[09:21.350 --> 09:23.350]  Set yourself up for success.
[09:23.350 --> 09:25.350]  Give your garden a chance.
[09:25.350 --> 09:27.350]  And it will be so much more enjoyable.
[09:27.350 --> 09:28.350]  Don't make it stressful.
[09:28.350 --> 09:30.350]  Make it something you enjoy.
[09:30.350 --> 09:34.350]  Starting off with a shitty plan like trying to remember to close the door every night at 930?
[09:34.350 --> 09:36.350]  That's going to frustrate you in two weeks.
[09:36.350 --> 09:39.350]  Alright, so I've stressed the importance of airflow.
[09:39.350 --> 09:43.350]  Let's move forward and talk about electricity and power consumption.
[09:43.350 --> 09:49.350]  Can you safely provide electricity to your grow area without causing a fire hazard?
[09:49.350 --> 09:54.350]  Don't be that guy that burned down your house with a poorly designed grow.
[09:54.350 --> 09:58.350]  That makes the whole grow movement look bad and sets us all back five years.
[09:58.350 --> 10:00.350]  So please be careful.
[10:00.350 --> 10:05.350]  Can you power a grow light, a fan, an exhaust fan, maybe an air conditioner,
[10:05.350 --> 10:08.350]  and whatever else you need for the grow space you choose?
[10:08.350 --> 10:18.350]  Don't pull too many amps from one breaker for too long because eventually something will melt and you will have a fire.
[10:18.350 --> 10:24.350]  If you flip a breaker more than two times a day, it is time to reconsider your electrical plan.
[10:24.350 --> 10:28.350]  Also, be prepared to pay for your electrical use.
[10:28.350 --> 10:35.350]  You won't have a crop for a few months, but you're going to have lights to pay for at the end of the first month.
[10:35.350 --> 10:37.350]  So be prepared for that bill.
[10:37.350 --> 10:43.350]  That's something a lot of young and new growers forget to plan ahead for.
[10:43.350 --> 10:46.350]  You hang up your grow light, you plug it in, you get shit running,
[10:46.350 --> 10:51.350]  you think, yeah, in like 90 to 120 days I'm going to harvest and have a bunch of money.
[10:51.350 --> 11:00.350]  And then in about 35 days, the bill comes and you go, oh shit, I got to pay a hundred extra dollars because I'm running this grow light and I didn't consider that.
[11:00.350 --> 11:02.350]  Plan ahead. There's a bill coming.
[11:02.350 --> 11:06.350]  Every month now, you've got a new bill to pay for that grow.
[11:06.350 --> 11:07.350]  Keep that in mind.
[11:07.350 --> 11:14.350]  Also, if you're going to pull a lot of extra electricity, have a plan to tell the electric company why.
[11:14.350 --> 11:15.350]  You need an excuse.
[11:15.350 --> 11:17.350]  They may ask.
[11:17.350 --> 11:19.350]  Sometimes they call.
[11:19.350 --> 11:21.350]  Sometimes they send a letter.
[11:21.350 --> 11:26.350]  Sometimes they show up and walk around the house to check for inefficiencies.
[11:26.350 --> 11:28.350]  Be very careful.
[11:28.350 --> 11:34.350]  Also, law enforcement can use your electric bill as probable cause.
[11:34.350 --> 11:41.350]  With the new smart meters, they can probably tell exactly how many kilowatts you're using at exactly which point of the day.
[11:41.350 --> 11:48.350]  So they can probably tell that at 9 a.m. you start pulling 4,000 watts worth of extra power until 9 p.m.
[11:48.350 --> 11:49.350]  And then it turns off.
[11:49.350 --> 11:51.350]  They probably know when you're in flower.
[11:51.350 --> 11:53.350]  They probably know when you're in veg.
[11:53.350 --> 12:00.350]  Keep that sort of stuff in mind when you're building and designing your grow and also when you're selecting your lights and equipment.
[12:00.350 --> 12:03.350]  And we'll talk about choosing lighting in a future episode.
[12:03.350 --> 12:06.350]  Now, the next thing we should consider is water.
[12:06.350 --> 12:08.350]  Can you get water to your grow area?
[12:08.350 --> 12:10.350]  Is your grow space in the attic?
[12:10.350 --> 12:13.350]  How are you going to get water to your attic?
[12:13.350 --> 12:17.350]  Are you going to fill up five-gallon water bottles and huck them up that ladder?
[12:17.350 --> 12:21.350]  Or are you going to run a hose up there and hope you don't have a catastrophe with that?
[12:21.350 --> 12:22.350]  Be very careful.
[12:22.350 --> 12:24.350]  Either way, please.
[12:24.350 --> 12:26.350]  What if your grow is in the basement?
[12:26.350 --> 12:28.350]  Is there a tap down there in the basement?
[12:28.350 --> 12:30.350]  Do you have access to water?
[12:30.350 --> 12:33.350]  Think about where your water is coming from.
[12:33.350 --> 12:35.350]  Also, think about runoff water.
[12:35.350 --> 12:41.350]  You'll need to dispose of water occasionally, especially if you're running a hydro system.
[12:41.350 --> 12:44.350]  Does your basement have a floor drain?
[12:44.350 --> 12:49.350]  If it's got a floor drain, give it a test before you go pouring a whole bunch of water down there.
[12:49.350 --> 12:50.350]  Pour a half a gallon.
[12:50.350 --> 12:51.350]  See what happens.
[12:51.350 --> 12:54.350]  If it doesn't clog up, pour a gallon.
[12:54.350 --> 12:55.350]  Pour two.
[12:55.350 --> 13:01.350]  Be patient because sometimes those floor drains, they're backed up way down the line and you've got to pour a bunch of water in there.
[13:01.350 --> 13:03.350]  And then suddenly, it overflows into your floor.
[13:03.350 --> 13:05.350]  Don't think you're going to pour a big reservoir down there.
[13:05.350 --> 13:07.350]  Don't think you're going to drain your hydro gear down there.
[13:07.350 --> 13:08.350]  Be very careful.
[13:08.350 --> 13:12.350]  Test that floor drain before you rely on it too much.
[13:12.350 --> 13:16.350]  You may also need to think about extra water consumption.
[13:16.350 --> 13:18.350]  It depends on how big your grow is.
[13:18.350 --> 13:20.350]  It depends on how much they're paying attention.
[13:20.350 --> 13:24.350]  It depends on if you pay the water bill or if the landlord pays the water bill.
[13:24.350 --> 13:27.350]  This just may be something to consider.
[13:27.350 --> 13:31.350]  Since we're talking about water, I'm going to mention get a good shop vac.
[13:31.350 --> 13:34.350]  You're going to have to get water to your grow on a daily basis.
[13:34.350 --> 13:41.350]  I use about five gallons of water per light, per day, maybe every other day when the plants are smaller.
[13:41.350 --> 13:46.350]  Think about how much water you're going to need while you're planning your grow space.
[13:46.350 --> 13:52.350]  Do you really think you want to huck a five-gallon container of water up that attic ladder for nine weeks?
[13:52.350 --> 13:58.350]  If you're not a medical marijuana patient now, you will be by the end of that grow cycle.
[13:59.350 --> 14:06.350]  Another thing we really need to think about when planning our grow space is darkness and light control.
[14:06.350 --> 14:11.350]  Can you make your space completely dark during your dark cycle?
[14:11.350 --> 14:13.350]  I don't mean dark to where it's kind of dark.
[14:13.350 --> 14:15.350]  I don't mean dark where there's a little bit of light.
[14:15.350 --> 14:19.350]  I mean dark to where it is scary dark.
[14:19.350 --> 14:21.350]  I mean zero light.
[14:22.350 --> 14:28.350]  Lay in your grow space for five or ten minutes with your eyes open and let your eyes adjust to that total darkness.
[14:28.350 --> 14:30.350]  Then wave your hand in front of your face.
[14:30.350 --> 14:33.350]  If you can see your hand at all, it is too light in there.
[14:33.350 --> 14:35.350]  We need absolute total darkness.
[14:35.350 --> 14:40.350]  Any light will potentially cause your plants to have issues.
[14:40.350 --> 14:46.350]  If your plants have light during their supposed night cycle, they might not even begin to flower.
[14:46.350 --> 14:48.350]  You may think you're in flower and you're still vegging.
[14:48.350 --> 14:52.350]  They may be getting just enough light to where they're kind of flowering, but they're still kind of vegging.
[14:52.350 --> 14:56.350]  They're looking really weird and they start taking on weird shapes and their leaves get strange.
[14:56.350 --> 14:57.350]  You could have that.
[14:57.350 --> 15:04.350]  Or if you've got a very small light leak, the area that is getting hit by that light will make hermaphrodite flowers.
[15:04.350 --> 15:09.350]  That will pollinate little sections of the room and you'll have little seeds in your buds.
[15:09.350 --> 15:15.350]  We need an area that we can keep absolutely dark during our dark cycle.
[15:15.350 --> 15:19.350]  Something that won't get interrupted by somebody needing to use the bathroom.
[15:19.350 --> 15:22.350]  Something that won't get interrupted by somebody needing to do laundry.
[15:22.350 --> 15:26.350]  Something that won't get interrupted by somebody going out to the garage to do something.
[15:26.350 --> 15:32.350]  Think ahead of all of the reasons somebody may need to go in your grow area.
[15:32.350 --> 15:38.350]  That's why I like a little grow tent or an isolated room or the back corner of the basement where nobody ever goes.
[15:39.350 --> 15:45.350]  So those are the major things to think about when building your grow and selecting your grow space.
[15:45.350 --> 15:47.350]  You want somewhere discreet and secure.
[15:47.350 --> 15:53.350]  You need to be able to control temperature and humidity within a very tight range.
[15:53.350 --> 16:00.350]  We want to get about 77 degrees with about 40% humidity in our flower rooms.
[16:00.350 --> 16:02.350]  You want to be able to dial that in.
[16:02.350 --> 16:06.350]  You need somewhere with adequate power and available water.
[16:06.350 --> 16:10.350]  You also may need an excuse for the extra consumption.
[16:10.350 --> 16:15.350]  Another very important factor we keep talking about is light control.
[16:15.350 --> 16:17.350]  We can't have light interruptions in our grow.
[16:17.350 --> 16:21.350]  We need to keep our light scheduled perfectly.
[16:21.350 --> 16:24.350]  The dark cycle is super critical during flowering you guys.
[16:24.350 --> 16:27.350]  It cannot be interrupted by the tiniest amount of light.
[16:27.350 --> 16:29.350]  I can't stress that enough.
[16:29.350 --> 16:33.350]  Like I said earlier, grow tents work great because somebody can't walk into the room
[16:33.350 --> 16:40.350]  and flip on the switch for the light that's in the room and accidentally get light in that grow tent if you've got it closed up properly.
[16:40.350 --> 16:42.350]  Don't leave it open for airflow.
[16:42.350 --> 16:45.350]  Like I talked about leaving the grow room door open earlier.
[16:45.350 --> 16:50.350]  Don't leave your grow tent open and get too stoned or get way too into a game of fork knife
[16:50.350 --> 16:56.350]  and totally forget that those lights went off at 7 and you left that room open and now it's 830 and you're freaking out.
[16:56.350 --> 16:57.350]  Don't let that shit happen.
[16:57.350 --> 17:02.350]  As long as you close the grow tent, you should be safe from light interruptions.
[17:02.350 --> 17:06.350]  I feel like I covered a lot of the basics of selecting your grow space.
[17:06.350 --> 17:12.350]  Think about your needs and your goals and try to find a space that works the best for you.
[17:12.350 --> 17:16.350]  As long as you can provide the essentials, you can make any space work.
[17:16.350 --> 17:20.350]  I've grown in that little mini closet underneath the stairs in an apartment.
[17:20.350 --> 17:24.350]  I've grown in a sketchy attic in a garage in Kansas.
[17:24.350 --> 17:27.350]  I've grown in a spare bedroom in Bessemer.
[17:27.350 --> 17:32.350]  And I've busted out basements with somewhere between 2 and 12 lights depending on the basement.
[17:32.350 --> 17:37.350]  I've also grown in giant warehouses and I've done a lot of growing in grow tents.
[17:37.350 --> 17:49.350]  The needs are the same in all of those spaces and a little planning and thought can make your tiny space produce the same quality as commercial grows if done wisely.
[17:49.350 --> 17:53.350]  Don't let anybody talk down to you for growing in a grow tent.
[17:53.350 --> 18:01.350]  Set your finished product next to their finished product and ask them if it was grown in a big room, in a warehouse, or in a tent.
[18:01.350 --> 18:07.350]  It doesn't matter as long as you are producing a product that makes you happy and meets your demands.
[18:07.350 --> 18:11.350]  That's the important part. Don't let anybody talk shit to you about the way you grow.
[18:11.350 --> 18:15.350]  Like we said last time, you're only doing it wrong if the plants die.
[18:15.350 --> 18:17.350]  Now let's move forward a little bit.
[18:17.350 --> 18:19.350]  Something I want to mention is cleanliness.
[18:19.350 --> 18:26.350]  If you set up in a basement or a spare room, try to get anything not grow related out of that space.
[18:26.350 --> 18:30.350]  I would recommend a solid cleaning of any space before setting up.
[18:30.350 --> 18:38.350]  And if the space has a funky, dingy smell, like if you're in a basement and it's got that basement smell, try to find the cause of that.
[18:38.350 --> 18:41.350]  What's down there making it funky? Can you get rid of it?
[18:41.350 --> 18:45.350]  And then maybe get a bunch of fresh air through that space for a little while before you set up.
[18:45.350 --> 18:49.350]  Maybe open some windows, get some fans going, spray some ozium in there.
[18:49.350 --> 18:55.350]  Just try to get rid of that funky smell because that smell could stick to your buds.
[18:55.350 --> 19:01.350]  You don't want to grow in a funky space and then you don't want your product to end up smelling like funky basement.
[19:01.350 --> 19:07.350]  And it will if your space has that funk, especially if you're going to dry and cure in a funky basement.
[19:07.350 --> 19:09.350]  So try to get rid of that funky basement smell.
[19:10.350 --> 19:16.350]  You can do that just by getting air into the room, get a little airflow, go and get that old funky air out of there.
[19:16.350 --> 19:17.350]  That'll really help you out.
[19:17.350 --> 19:19.350]  Earlier I said to clean the room.
[19:19.350 --> 19:25.350]  Everything in a room is a spot for a spider mite or a pest to hang out and hide.
[19:25.350 --> 19:26.350]  Every little spot.
[19:26.350 --> 19:30.350]  If you've got some clothes in there, that's a beautiful spot for a bunch of bugs just to hang out.
[19:30.350 --> 19:33.350]  Just try to clean up the space and have a nice, tidy grow space.
[19:33.350 --> 19:37.350]  It'll help you keep everything organized and it will help you keep bugs away.
[19:38.350 --> 19:39.350]  So find a good space.
[19:39.350 --> 19:40.350]  Make sure it's safe.
[19:40.350 --> 19:43.350]  Make sure you can get a lot of airflow to the area.
[19:43.350 --> 19:46.350]  Make sure you can get water to the area.
[19:46.350 --> 19:53.350]  If you're going to provide supplemental CO2 to your grow space, make sure you can carry CO2 tanks to the area.
[19:53.350 --> 19:55.350]  Those tanks are heavy.
[19:55.350 --> 20:01.350]  Make sure that you can control the lights in your grow space and also the darkness in your grow space.
[20:01.350 --> 20:06.350]  And be sure that you can control the flow of human traffic in your grow area.
[20:06.350 --> 20:08.350]  Also, you don't want your pets down there.
[20:08.350 --> 20:10.350]  I do not encourage people taking their animals to the grow.
[20:10.350 --> 20:11.350]  I see it a lot.
[20:11.350 --> 20:13.350]  If you want your pet in the grow, that's on you.
[20:13.350 --> 20:14.350]  I do not encourage it.
[20:14.350 --> 20:16.350]  They go play in the yard.
[20:16.350 --> 20:19.350]  They're picking up pests probably from every plant in the yard.
[20:19.350 --> 20:20.350]  They're bringing it right into your grow.
[20:20.350 --> 20:21.350]  I don't encourage that.
[20:21.350 --> 20:23.350]  But you do what makes you happy.
[20:23.350 --> 20:26.350]  Like I said, you're only doing it wrong when the plants die.
[20:26.350 --> 20:30.350]  So the next step is to make sure this is something you want to do.
[20:31.350 --> 20:38.350]  And then we will talk about selecting specific equipment for your specific grow in the next episode.
