[01:53.960 --> 02:03.760]  you know, like I've got a real question. My coworker has a nine year old nephew and that kid wants to do voiceovers as he's playing video games twitch style,
[02:03.880 --> 02:11.480]  but he doesn't know how to do it. He just wants to record a video of the screen right while he's playing with his voice over it to play any of those games.
[02:11.480 --> 02:21.840]  You got to have a decent graphics card. He's running a computer, huh? Not not well if he's no, if he's doing it to a console, you can get a capture a capture card.
[02:21.840 --> 02:33.120]  I think is what it is just basically this thing. Okay, that plugs in between your TV and your deal. And it records it in 1080p. What's the fucking company?
[02:34.120 --> 02:41.600]  That's enough for me, bro. That's, you know, I got Google from there. It's called a capture card. Okay. I'll find out. I'll find out. Gato is the name brand.
[02:41.640 --> 02:49.120]  I've got the cat. So he's doing it off of a console. I'm not sure that's what I need. That's that's my cat. L pussy cat. Oh,
[02:50.920 --> 02:52.200]  how is your kidding noise?

[06:49.960 --> 07:18.280]  Your word. Hey, I got what I was in the lovely facilities here in the county. I got the name. So you know, there was actually somebody in there with a beautiful, beautiful, like flowing Tennessee waterfall, like the best one I've ever seen. And literally, dude, everybody kept asking him, Where are you from Kentucky? Like, and he's like, No, I'm from here. And he's just like, he was a normal dude. But he had the best mullet ever. Shout out to the dude with a killer mullet in county lockup. Tennessee waterfall.

[07:36.960 --> 08:02.960]  Yeah, yeah. So let me ask you, how's it? How does it feel to be here at the table? Like recording? We've talked about like, it feels awesome. All right, cool. My hand. But yeah. Yeah. I'm wondering if we can turn them green. This show and this table is turned a handful of people green. Oh, you want to admit that you were part of that group?
[08:03.960 --> 08:30.960]  I've been multiple part of that group over and over again that RSO that is the highest I've ever been. I'm not sure what RSO ice hash with the ice the ISO ISO sorry. No, it's just I wasn't even ISO I was pH. Oh, I think I don't remember man. We took solventless hash and then we pressed it and use a rosin press to press out some solventless some fresh frozen solvent. Yeah, nice. And then I rolled it out again. I heated up a carb cap and rolled it out like solventless and gave him a fast.
[08:30.960 --> 08:55.960]  There's no operating moving vehicles at that point, bro. Like I literally pulled over and slept in a parking lot. I may have been homeless at the time, but I was going somewhere else. You know, I was in the parking lot. You're going to go meet Jesse at the time. And I was like, I texted Jeff. I was like, Hey, text Jesse. I can't when you got your possession ticket. No, no, that was that was why I came over here. I think was to tell him about me the possession. I was headed to be homeless somewhere else.
[08:55.960 --> 09:24.960]  Yeah, gotta be the best part about being homeless. Like, fuck it here looks good. I'm home. I'm never leaving again. You know, like this is and everybody's like, why Pablo? And it's like, why not? Why not? You know, like, just go from Walmart to Walmart. There's two of them. So, you know, I want to talk about this for a second. Since a lot of people that listen to my podcast expect some sort of cannabis stock. Adam got the only person that I have ever seen it happen to got a possession.
[09:25.960 --> 09:54.960]  Of cannabis ticket. I'm definitely the first person this year. 12. Right. Since we have legalized cannabis. No, I know there's tons of them a year. Yeah, but that's what you told me. Where? Maybe feel better about myself. Don't give me shit. Friends are for. Yeah, exactly. All right. Well, I may be the only person. I think that. Yeah, I may have dreamt that I may have left and heard his words in my own in my own voice and been like, yeah, this is not the most perfect elbow. Oh, I know. Yeah. These mic stands are killer. I discovered that like two shows ago.
[09:55.960 --> 10:24.960]  But over there, it doesn't work as no, no, this isn't this right here. It's like, yeah, these mic stands are I'm completely away from the table at any point. There's a thousand dollars in glass on the table right now. And I'm like, no, no, no, there's water bottles and there's more than that. I'm good. This one. Good. This one was a G. Yeah. Well, I mean, a that piece, though, that piece, though. Yeah. Yeah. Shout out to the person that made that. Lots of people get tickets in national parks. I don't know about that. I mean, those home improvement park. Every time you go to the woods in Florida, you damn sure you get tickets.
[10:25.960 --> 10:45.960]  Or walk out of there with a can of somebody walks out, somebody owned up to it. And they're like, well, I mean, I'm a ride everybody a ticket, which we all know that's a bunch of bullshit. You know, I'm saying somebody's got to own up to it or you just found some weed, bro. I don't know what to tell you. Good smoking that, you know, like, no. Every time you go to the National Forest in Florida, you get a cannabis ticket. Don't care. Yeah. But it's not legal. It's not.
[10:45.960 --> 11:14.960]  Yeah. And it Colorado. It's legal. And you can still get a ticket. No, if you're not. Well, if you're smoking in the wrong area, if you're smoking at a state park, if you're smoking at the skate park. What about what about if he you're watching a movie with your cat in your lap trying to stay warm while it's snowing and you're in your car, though, you're smoking a bowl because you're watching a movie happens to be the best movie pretty much of the beginning of the year. They ruined Star Wars. Fuck them. Fuck the police. I don't care what you guys say.
[11:15.960 --> 11:28.960]  That's the way I feel about it. These are all the opinions of our 444444. And I think 44 and two. No, no, no, no, no. We're dabbing over there, bro. Tell us about what we're dabbing. Beautiful looking chatter.
[11:29.960 --> 11:56.960]  44 and a quarter. Yeah. Yeah. See, 45 just doesn't roll off the tongue. 44 plus one ankle monitor. Right. So what time do you have to be home tonight? I honestly, I told him today that we're doing two podcasts. So it's kind of like whenever I know I'm good for an hour or two. I have the second show you've recorded today. Absolutely. Nice. So is that why you guys were like, we've done this already? Yeah. Sorry. I didn't I didn't mean to not fill in your audience.
[11:56.960 --> 12:25.960]  Bro, bro. No, it's cool, man. Do you think, do you think it shows in when you can? I know how it is trying to record a podcast. You can put that torch right up to the mic, dude. I don't want him to. Thursdays are normal recording day. Me too. That's my normal shout out to Ross to set, by the way. I was shot. Hey, yeah. He told us straight up that we were, we were a little mean to each other. So we've been trying to be more positive. You and said we're mean to each other. No, no, no. Me and Derek said that you said that you two were mean to all of us. Talk a lot of shit to each other on your podcast.
[12:26.960 --> 12:56.920]  I listened to the Colorado podcast. I appreciate that. Raz each other. Yeah. Well, I mean, I don't know. Down at the box. Yeah. We're just friends. Yeah. So you guys should take some dabs and play some video games. Yeah. I guess just that's just how our friendship kind of evolved. Yeah. I mean, it was good to fuck with Adam. It was a construction friendship. You remember? I mean, you were here around.
[12:56.960 --> 13:09.400]  That's kind of when I gave you a shout out on the show one time I told you to fucking get to work. That was great too. Cause we were literally working and he walks in and it's like, Hey Derek, get to fucking work. And he was like, fuck this. I'm fucked.
[13:09.400 --> 13:36.400]  I see what happened. I see it. Oh, that's fucking funny. Just cover the whole welcome to the table. I'm worried about the whole welcome to the table. The courts, you can burn it off. There's another courts banger over there. There's another banger in the, on the shelf. I could shotgun this.
[13:37.400 --> 13:59.400]  So let's fill in the listeners on what just happened. Uh, so dirty D took a dab, set the rig down and just rested it gently up against Jesse's, uh, his tea bottle. Now it's perfectly carved. Now he's got a carb. Yeah. How'd it go down your throat? Like that last sip? Was it smooth? Yeah. It went down like a wide mouth can or something like a shotgun Keystone.
[14:00.400 --> 14:23.400]  Back in college, man. That Bob Ross, that too, right there. Everybody's going to, there's gonna be people tuning in like this dude shot gun a key stand before we're good. My listeners don't know what the fuck is going on. I mean, if they're old listeners, they might, they might remember, but this is, I'm chaos. Uh, you know, the girl from your heart meets a trailer park.
[14:24.400 --> 14:48.400]  That's good. That's pretty good. Yeah. Good. That was accurate. Yes. This one summarizes that very nicely there. Adam's going to hit the, uh, the hit man, Samson collab. I was going to ask what this was. So the hit man and Samson. Yeah. I don't know what color, what color that pool is. I'm not sure what color it's pretty fresh. It's like minty green turquoise ish. It's got a green label. It's got the green flame.
[14:49.400 --> 14:58.400]  I thought that was the same one you've always had. I see. No, it's bigger. Yeah. It's a little clogged. Colorful. The other one's clogged up from the secret session.
[14:59.400 --> 15:25.400]  I wish I could have been there next time, bro. Next time. Put yourself on the list. Send an email. Yeah. Yeah. I just, honestly, I don't think any of us knew it was happening. We were like, look at me live from the senior session. We were like, Oh, it's a secret. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, we're kind of the local Pueblo guys though. You know, like you're, you're the local Pueblo guys.
[15:25.400 --> 15:55.400]  You're a little bit more of the, the, the bigger mover and shaker. We're, we're down here down by the Reaver. Just, you know, Adam's just kicking it. Just recognizable. Cause I'm fucking six, five and have dreadlocks to my ass. And everyone's like, Oh, it's that guy. Yeah. I guess it's my thighs. Yeah. I would say to you. Yeah. They're almost to my knees. I tell people that I don't tell people how long they are. I tell them how old they are. I was like, yeah. The day you posted on Facebook, I was like, they were like, how long are they? And I was like, I don't know. They're 11 years old. I was like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[15:55.400 --> 15:57.620]  Oh, it's like a child, bro.
[15:57.660 --> 15:57.900]  Right.
[15:57.940 --> 15:58.300]  Yeah.
[15:59.180 --> 16:03.080]  Taller than some people I know may have a remit, but yeah.
[16:04.580 --> 16:09.200]  I remember when you were guitar Center, they were really like, electric sport, the band down all the time.
[16:09.380 --> 16:10.220]  Nipple lay fish.
[16:10.560 --> 16:13.100]  I had to quit rocking the bandana cause it was making my dreads grow funny.
[16:13.400 --> 16:16.060]  Like I still do it occasionally, but it was making the hair grow weird.
[16:16.880 --> 16:17.740]  I know about that.
[16:18.380 --> 16:18.880]  Grow funny.
[16:19.380 --> 16:21.080]  Do you know Ryan C?
[16:22.380 --> 16:23.060]  With dreadlocks
[16:24.340 --> 16:24.820]  for years.
[16:24.920 --> 16:25.160]  Yeah.
[16:25.400 --> 16:32.380]  I just yeah Frank Cox. Yeah, that dude's cool as fuck. He had dreads way before me. I
[16:33.380 --> 16:37.740]  Worked with him the summer he put him in nice and we were working up in slide
[16:37.740 --> 16:39.500]  I put in phone lines and shit like that
[16:39.500 --> 16:46.020]  And he kept the entire summer like even when we're off work and everything kept it wrapped up in a big bandana and everything
[16:46.500 --> 16:50.020]  Nowadays, he's got they're freaking massive. I bet yeah, I probably would
[16:51.500 --> 16:53.500]  They get so heavy
[16:55.400 --> 16:57.400]  Is there thick like
[16:58.320 --> 17:00.840]  Smokey you know smoky now I do
[17:03.800 --> 17:05.800]  Probably a new smokey
[17:06.240 --> 17:12.360]  No, no, no, no, then it's a different smoky, but he is a younger Hispanic guy with a bunch of tattoos, though
[17:13.360 --> 17:15.840]  I feel like having dreadlocks is like having a child
[17:16.240 --> 17:19.040]  But only attached to your head cuz you have to like take care of them and shit
[17:19.040 --> 17:22.520]  I was born like this a little bit of maintenance to be done now that they're this long

[19:13.600 --> 19:15.600]  I've been with you
[19:17.920 --> 19:25.600]  The coquettes served like tofu it was all your normal taco fixins, but then tofu that had been seasoned and done well
[19:27.320 --> 19:29.320]  Thinking mushrooms
[19:31.280 --> 19:36.240]  That's what the the fucking mellow mushroom they replace all meat with that place
[19:37.240 --> 19:41.240]  Fucking so fire dude that was that was probably the best pizza
[19:41.240 --> 19:44.240]  I mean it wasn't cheap for my standards, but I mean it is Denver
[19:44.240 --> 19:47.960]  Do you know like I threw it in there so everybody at the table didn't go yeah?
[19:50.600 --> 19:52.600]  About
[19:52.680 --> 19:54.520]  About a mile away from the secret sesh
[19:54.520 --> 19:59.040]  There's a little pizza joint that I wish I could remember the fucking name of it because it's pointless to just talk about it
[19:59.040 --> 19:59.600]  Not know the name
[19:59.600 --> 20:04.280]  But it's basically the size of the pizza joint is the size of this whole recording area like this little area
[20:04.960 --> 20:09.920]  And they were playing like hardcore music, I guess I don't it was fucking real distorted
[20:09.920 --> 20:12.040]  But kind of slow the dude was mad and screaming a lot
[20:12.960 --> 20:16.400]  I've noticed this before hardcore music and pizza places
[20:17.720 --> 20:19.720]  Yeah
[20:19.720 --> 20:21.720]  Fucking hot-ass
[20:35.480 --> 20:39.640]  Place is pretty pretty badass new pizza slices were 250 for a slice of cheese pizza
[20:39.640 --> 20:43.080]  And then I'm at a topping and like certain toppings or certain prices then your basic shit
[20:43.240 --> 20:47.320]  But the slice of pizza was like a third of fucking eighth of the pie
[20:47.440 --> 20:51.640]  I mean it was a big-ass fucking slice of pizza, but for 250 or three slices of pizza
[20:51.640 --> 20:54.800]  I couldn't even eat the fucking third one, so that's the cheapest
[20:57.680 --> 21:00.160]  Have you tried a black Jack's
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.080]  Tomato and green chili it's here in town. No, but I have a good friend that works there
[21:05.080 --> 21:08.560]  So shout out to my friend of blackjack pizza. I got three or four friends that were here, too
[21:09.280 --> 21:14.520]  Same people yeah, well. I also know the other one of the other delivery drivers there, so we'd really talk about yeah
[21:14.520 --> 21:16.520]  We are started for high
[21:19.080 --> 21:21.080]  Hey
[21:32.960 --> 21:39.720]  They go well together, that's all we're saying I have totally paid for pizza with cannabis before
[21:44.640 --> 21:49.880]  I know I mean for how long you've been ordering the one place you go to all the time like I'm sure
[21:50.160 --> 21:56.120]  There's been a couple delivery drivers throughout the time you're like pizza place that I can call and tell them who I am
[21:56.400 --> 21:58.520]  Just be like can I get that pizza and like oh yeah?
[21:58.520 --> 22:01.680]  We owe you and they just show up with pizzas. I can't talk about all that. I can't say
[22:03.800 --> 22:06.360]  As well yeah, is it the one that way I don't know
[22:08.840 --> 22:12.480]  Hey, I don't know I'm gonna tell you from experience that usually means yes
[22:14.520 --> 22:18.640]  I hate to spoil the pizzas fucking free and delicious
[22:18.960 --> 22:22.080]  Driver comes in it takes two fat dabs and sets down pizzas
[22:22.080 --> 22:25.120]  I hand him a couple of bucks as a kindness kindness to same same deal
[22:25.120 --> 22:29.640]  Yeah, same deal back in his car, and he says text me later text me anytime, bro
[22:29.640 --> 22:30.040]  Yeah
[22:30.040 --> 22:36.280]  I can do that and ever ever ever since you know the right the hash has gotten a whole lot better it definitely that helped
[22:36.280 --> 22:43.160]  The game too. You know he's like holy shit, bro. I was like yeah, it's it's it's good usually on my podcast
[22:43.160 --> 22:47.240]  I can't take big giant dabs cuz I get all dabbed out and can't talk, but there's fucking four people here
[22:47.240 --> 22:49.800]  So I'm gonna dab this go ahead dab that I'm gonna taste
[22:51.200 --> 22:54.960]  No, I mean I'm it. I'm gonna dab all of oh no go ahead dab all of that
[22:54.960 --> 22:56.960]  I'll take a taste of whatever that
[22:58.360 --> 23:00.360]  Take a taster
[23:00.760 --> 23:02.760]  You're coming into his big dab
[23:03.760 --> 23:09.800]  Man, it's like a half a gram, and that's only like 0.3. You just ruined everything. I know I was trying to get high over here
[23:10.800 --> 23:11.840]  I
[23:11.840 --> 23:14.560]  Try to do the play-by-play here trying to cough on a podcast
[23:15.360 --> 23:19.760]  So I don't think that's possible. He's got a dab. That's it's about the size of a dime
[23:20.480 --> 23:25.200]  Little little dime micro patty a shout-out to Rasta said it kind of looks like Australia
[23:27.600 --> 23:29.600]  He's about to smoke you
[23:30.640 --> 23:32.640]  Said you need to come to the States my friend
[23:34.320 --> 23:36.320]  No we need to go to him
[23:37.160 --> 23:39.880]  I have to be here
[23:42.920 --> 23:44.920]  Everything
[23:46.720 --> 23:49.680]  Except for us well that might be worth the risk
[23:51.640 --> 23:53.640]  Turn your mic towards you
[23:54.080 --> 23:58.080]  He has a problem with not talking into the mic directly. He's getting good at podcasting
[23:58.080 --> 24:01.960]  I think his first podcast appearance was probably my show yeah
[24:02.560 --> 24:05.520]  He didn't speak much and when he did he said um
[24:08.080 --> 24:11.240]  With us I listen to your guys's to the Colorado podcast and
[24:11.720 --> 24:13.720]  He can do a show now
[24:16.200 --> 24:19.200]  Tell people to listen definitely appreciate it
[24:25.080 --> 24:27.080]  You're taking your role as kind of a leader
[24:28.080 --> 24:33.400]  I have to thank God I have to contain myself on this show and not totally just take control of me the leader
[24:33.680 --> 24:36.200]  Well you heard our leader from the beginning there
[24:41.520 --> 24:45.440]  I was just playing around seeing I was gonna work out and it worked fucking beautifully so
[24:45.880 --> 24:48.520]  By the way, I'm Jesse grows from the Colorado
[24:49.160 --> 24:51.880]  Yeah, and I'm sure your mother is a wonderful lady
[24:53.440 --> 24:55.440]  Take a fat dive and give you a hug
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.760]  Gonna take the shows over if you say no no no no it's when you say all right. Yeah
[25:02.960 --> 25:04.960]  Not gonna take your thunder there
[25:05.240 --> 25:10.240]  I have a friend who claims that they are going to beat me to the intro like I'm gonna memorize the whole thing and
[25:10.240 --> 25:12.480]  Do it I'll let you do it if you really want to
[25:12.800 --> 25:18.920]  We'll see Clint Clint tried one time. That was really funny. I bet that was notice how many times Clint's been back. Yeah
[25:19.920 --> 25:21.920]  I
[25:22.560 --> 25:26.320]  Watched you do the intro is pretty impressive actually no no paper now
[25:27.080 --> 25:30.080]  All the sponsors fucking just kill it. I don't know notes
[25:30.080 --> 25:35.200]  I do most of the pop most of my podcasts have been happening in two takes I do about 15 to 20 minutes
[25:35.200 --> 25:39.560]  I got pause yeah, take a break by then and take a drink cuz I'm doing it by myself
[25:39.560 --> 25:45.720]  It's hard to talk for a fucking you're almost at 150 right I think this will probably be in the 130s the mid
[25:45.800 --> 25:50.120]  130s 134 is up this actually the recording this is labeled 135
[25:50.120 --> 25:52.920]  I'm not sure it goes 135 or 136 the truth
[25:52.920 --> 25:57.480]  I mean 52 weeks out of the year doing one a week. That's yeah, that's impressive. Yeah
[25:58.480 --> 26:05.720]  Facebook memory the other day. It was a just recorded my first podcast or so nice right yeah, that'd be about two years ago
[26:07.560 --> 26:10.580]  This shows my shows a little over two years yeah, yeah
[26:11.020 --> 26:13.100]  Over I it was in the middle of April
[26:13.100 --> 26:18.760]  I think was two years around cannabis cup time or not cannabis cup time right before it or something yeah
[26:18.760 --> 26:20.760]  I think so because we you hit a
[26:22.620 --> 26:28.100]  Episode 50 right around cannabis cup time I believe because that would be about a year yeah, right
[26:28.100 --> 26:30.180]  You know sometimes I would do two episodes a week
[26:32.460 --> 26:35.280]  It's hard to have that much content yeah, it's worth
[26:35.280 --> 26:37.280]  That was
[26:37.280 --> 26:40.960]  You know and it was kind of like hey, I got a podcast you want to come be on it and people were like
[26:43.560 --> 26:47.680]  It's like our guest the other week when I brought fetus in it was just like he was my roommate
[26:47.680 --> 26:49.680]  He was just kind of hanging out
[26:50.400 --> 26:54.200]  He sat down and just saying it yeah, you got a friend named fetus yeah
[26:55.880 --> 27:01.840]  See how he literally like signaled the airplane to land on the deck and then said hold on one minute
[27:01.840 --> 27:03.840]  You have a name a friend named fetus
[27:03.840 --> 27:08.240]  Yeah, he's he's a little young so you know it's like a baby type deal
[27:08.240 --> 27:14.240]  You know like he's he's 18, but he's like he's like an adopted kid that is allowed to hang you know that
[27:18.240 --> 27:20.240]  Every group needs a fetus yeah
[27:21.560 --> 27:27.420]  It's better than Seamus the nickname comes from an incident with some acid and maybe a position yeah
[27:28.080 --> 27:30.080]  I mean
[27:30.200 --> 27:31.280]  Before I left the house
[27:31.280 --> 27:36.640]  I literally dabbed him out so much that he's sitting in front of a grow tent with it on like bright as fuck with his
[27:36.640 --> 27:38.640]  Hands on his like his head or on his knees
[27:39.160 --> 27:41.000]  Trying to go to sleep
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.800]  Fucking 630 he's fucking 18 years old dude like he just can't stay awake
[27:45.800 --> 27:51.140]  And he'll fall asleep on the couch and just like curl up, and it's just like that's all the older that kid is yeah
[27:51.140 --> 27:54.320]  He's 18. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[27:55.040 --> 28:00.460]  It's cool. He's my roommate. He's nobody cares from your from Wisconsin, bro, or whatever the fuck, Iowa
[28:01.920 --> 28:07.920]  And definitely not Callie. Hey, I'm fucking hey, I'm not saying it to you. Hey
[28:12.720 --> 28:17.520]  Yeah, no, there's definitely worse places to be I need to show you guys the
[28:17.840 --> 28:19.840]  Mexifornia
[28:20.040 --> 28:22.160]  Cartoon or Cali. I don't know which one it is
[28:22.840 --> 28:29.120]  Whichever cartoon that I watch Borderlands or border you wouldn't see that yeah, I did it still there's something there what happened there Susan
[28:29.120 --> 28:35.520]  I I didn't want to choke on the podcast okay, just to leave it Jeff just stabbed Australia, man. Yeah
[28:36.520 --> 28:39.200]  That was definitely a point three or point four
[28:40.360 --> 28:44.720]  I like to take dabs all right, I've been practicing and then you talk afterwards
[28:45.680 --> 28:50.920]  That's what's more amazing to anyone at the table because we're all cigarette smokers and we're like fuck you I
[28:52.760 --> 28:56.560]  Don't even think about it like I was at a company meeting yesterday
[28:57.640 --> 29:03.960]  Yeah, this is a peek into my life you guys I was at a company meeting yesterday at the the 420 dab lounge
[29:03.960 --> 29:05.960]  I don't remember the real name the 420
[29:06.240 --> 29:13.680]  And things the 420 dab lounge most people go to golf courses or like to brunch. Yeah, yeah, and the boss handed me a
[29:14.560 --> 29:19.200]  Thing of hash and I was like am I supposed to take a glob out of it or just taste it
[29:19.200 --> 29:21.600]  He's like go in the middle because everybody needs to get some
[29:21.800 --> 29:27.840]  So I took a big fat chunk and tastes pretty damn good, then everybody watched me take like a half-gram dab. Yeah
[29:28.560 --> 29:30.560]  That's what our work meetings are like
[29:30.880 --> 29:36.040]  Gave me an awesome business. I do yeah, so just host shut up
[29:44.560 --> 29:48.720]  Way too serious to be tried you're just way too busy to be trying to do anything
[29:48.720 --> 29:53.480]  I had to ask if I was like am I supposed to take like my kind of dad out of this
[29:54.320 --> 29:58.520]  You're kind of dad out of this hash. This ain't my hash. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to
[29:58.520 --> 30:03.240]  I'm sure we all seen that meme go around here recently. It's like yes. I'm going to smoke all your hash
[30:04.720 --> 30:09.520]  Absolutely you're the person I thought of like yeah, oh I can take a big dab. I've literally heard you ask
[30:09.520 --> 30:12.040]  Hey, man, can I get a big dab of that and they're like yeah?
[30:12.040 --> 30:16.480]  Yeah, sure, and they're like piecing two pieces together, and they're like no no no can I like that?
[30:17.760 --> 30:21.680]  Yeah, we just hit that with something and whatever the biggest piece is can I have that?
[30:22.360 --> 30:28.080]  Yeah, because and I've seen you take it and they are like they're sitting there with the job and go like it's not bad man
[30:28.080 --> 30:31.320]  Tastes pretty good cool. Thanks, bro. Where's who's next?
[30:32.240 --> 30:34.320]  Yeah, for sure. We're at the
[30:35.600 --> 30:38.960]  One of the cannabis cups, and I don't even remember which one it was
[30:39.560 --> 30:43.960]  And it was hard to find a place to smoke at this these older events there weren't tables and shit like there are now
[30:43.960 --> 30:47.120]  And I finally found a place, and I'm chilling out and this girl's like hey
[30:47.120 --> 30:50.440]  Can I join you guys and so we let her fucking hang out with us of course and she threw down some hash
[30:50.440 --> 30:53.600]  He was here smoke this and so I did it was a good-sized chunk of hash
[30:53.600 --> 30:57.120]  I thought she was kind of kind of challenging me, so I picked it up and fucking dabbed it
[30:57.120 --> 30:59.120]  She goes dude that was for everybody to smoke
[31:00.160 --> 31:02.280]  You threw it down and said here smoke this
[31:03.480 --> 31:05.480]  Reminds me of a story about

[31:14.280 --> 31:17.120]  Have another pod just for that kind of story
[31:17.640 --> 31:23.240]  We sure do we sure do we can record that story right after this you someone may have had
[31:23.880 --> 31:26.440]  something that goes up a person's nose and
[31:29.640 --> 31:34.840]  Someone misunderstood it and thought it was for everyone
[31:39.240 --> 31:42.360]  Florida problems, I've done it with LSD as well
[31:44.800 --> 31:49.840]  Hang on to this sweet tart, I'm just gonna eat it no that was for four people. It's gonna be a fun night
[31:51.120 --> 31:55.520]  That's why you're supposed to portion it out. I may or may not remember April so
[31:56.480 --> 31:58.560]  Don't just hand people drugs
[31:59.560 --> 32:01.560]  Exactly portion it out
[32:01.600 --> 32:03.840]  Or just keep it for yourself and make it last a month
[32:03.840 --> 32:10.080]  Funner to do with people incorrect sir incorrect just saying yeah, I've been day tripping by myself before that's not

[33:16.960 --> 33:19.640]  How about that fucking ankle it way a lot?
[33:20.480 --> 33:23.680]  So much so that if they changed it from one ankle to the other today
[33:23.720 --> 33:27.880]  It's still there's still a mark in the other side of my ankle like where it's been there for a month
[33:27.880 --> 33:32.600]  Yeah, when they first put it on it was so tight that it literally like you could see the little holes
[33:36.760 --> 33:38.760]  Yeah, all right

[34:15.760 --> 34:17.760]  Doesn't heat
[34:19.760 --> 34:24.320]  You can just run the other one on the floor just have it up here blinking and people would never know and all and everything
[34:24.320 --> 34:28.560]  Fried out on it. Oh, well, we can get LEDs super cheap
[34:31.240 --> 34:32.400]  Yeah
[34:32.400 --> 34:37.540]  And then it started again though. One day it started and then it went out. It wasn't a very good unit
[34:38.480 --> 34:41.560]  Well, I mean it was kind of first of its kind
[34:42.400 --> 34:44.840]  Yeah towards the beginning. It was kind of a gift
[34:45.960 --> 34:53.100]  D-nails all day. So the company that gifted it to me kind of went weird on me. So I'm just avoiding all that conversation
[34:53.100 --> 34:55.100]  They went Mormon
[34:55.160 --> 34:57.160]  They were Canadian
[34:57.880 --> 34:59.880]  Then I had to pay taxes on it
[35:00.600 --> 35:02.840]  Sent over the border like six months later
[35:02.840 --> 35:06.080]  I get a bill from the Canadian government or somebody and I'm like what the fuck is this about?
[35:06.080 --> 35:11.680]  They're like you owe us taxes for some $400 gift that was sent to you and I was like, yeah, that's called spam, bro
[35:16.600 --> 35:22.080]  Someone got they wanted to just the taxes on the 400 night tried to ignore it twice and then the letters changed colors
[35:22.080 --> 35:27.120]  Did you know you're related to his impoverished prints too? And he's got two trucks just waiting for you
[35:29.920 --> 35:32.360]  They went from white to yellow pink
[35:34.160 --> 35:38.800]  There's like 16 bucks I didn't really care that much but okay was that American dollars or
[35:39.480 --> 35:41.680]  American dollars. Oh boy. They got you
[35:41.680 --> 35:43.680]  Converted

[47:29.680 --> 47:35.080]  I chopped down trees and bring them out to the room and wham and then fucking hand them to Randall's and then by the
[47:35.080 --> 47:39.080]  End of the day. I got a pile of trim buds, dude. It's fucking amazing. I'm shout out to that kid
[47:39.080 --> 47:45.240]  I still want more of those episodes something like all just sitting around kicking it singing like bullshit and oh with the turpy boys
[47:45.240 --> 47:47.240]  Yeah, boys turpy boys
[47:47.280 --> 47:51.160]  Do you do metric stuff ever? Yeah, I do metric all day long. Yeah, what do you think?
[47:51.160 --> 47:53.880]  You're their cute little message. Oh, yeah metric went down
[47:53.880 --> 47:57.920]  I was gonna talk about that a normal on a normal episode of my show, but this is good metric went down
[47:59.520 --> 48:03.520]  For like fucking six hours dude, and you couldn't do anything
[48:04.200 --> 48:06.080]  Nothing you couldn't yeah
[48:06.080 --> 48:11.320]  You pretty much could was it around on the retail end because I think they use MMJ menu on the retail end so they could
[48:11.320 --> 48:15.640]  Do that the retail worked fine, but any of the grow we had we were packaging a transfer
[48:16.400 --> 48:20.760]  And a large transfer like we're in the middle of a hefty harvest
[48:20.760 --> 48:24.480]  I don't even want to talk about how much are we were packaging, but we're making lots of packages
[48:24.480 --> 48:27.980]  It took me and another dude fucking a couple hours to put all these packages together
[48:28.240 --> 48:31.520]  Like so we put all the packages together their way there in bags
[48:31.520 --> 48:35.540]  We got the marker written on and when we go to do it in the computer and metric says sorry we're down
[48:36.520 --> 48:38.840]  Like we can do shit. Yeah
[48:38.840 --> 48:45.440]  I can't quote it with this but a stupid little message, but then it came back up the next day and it's like
[48:45.720 --> 48:47.360]  We've had our
[48:47.360 --> 48:48.560]  Yeah

[54:19.220 --> 54:21.380]  Nothing, man. I like being around my friends
[54:23.220 --> 54:27.100]  You know like just to hang out with these two bucks is one thing like together
[54:27.180 --> 54:34.060]  But then like you're always so busy now that you know eventually eventually does he just sound like when he talks yeah
[54:34.260 --> 54:38.320]  He's literally walked in and out of the room, and I just kept walking and talking and so have you
[54:40.420 --> 54:43.820]  Don't hear it. He'll be talking to be saying something that suddenly should be
[54:46.420 --> 54:54.060]  I mean I gotta figure out like his different pitches and tones. Yeah, I'm not a whale
[54:56.980 --> 55:01.460]  Just put him in a mix music underneath him what key you rambling in
[55:04.660 --> 55:07.620]  Damn it see that'd be funnier than you guys doing a rap song
[55:07.740 --> 55:08.860]  Guys
[55:08.860 --> 55:12.860]  Dude, you can absolutely I'll give you everything you need and dare to cane like hello

[55:25.580 --> 55:31.020]  Somebody it's funny the other week Jesse was saying something. I was giving somebody shit like oh
[55:31.260 --> 55:35.700]  You don't need to say that on blah blah blah blah social media, and I was like I don't give a fuck
[55:36.100 --> 55:41.660]  My nickname 44 I don't give zero fucks, and he's like oh you talk all this big shit online and Jesse chimes in with no
[55:41.780 --> 55:43.780]  That's really him
[55:45.620 --> 55:49.460]  No no that's that's that's really him he wouldn't give two fucks. He's not a troll
[55:53.380 --> 55:57.140]  Just a troll yeah, I'm the one that lives under the bridge not on the internet
[55:58.300 --> 56:03.140]  Yeah, is it what does that sound for you? Is that was that my ego deflated?
[56:03.620 --> 56:08.820]  There's a secret behind what you said oh, there's a secret. Oh, is it a troll secret?
[56:09.420 --> 56:12.900]  Because I mean if I if I had a troll secret, I would I would probably come to you
[56:13.300 --> 56:20.180]  You've been you've been known to to piss quite a few people. Oh no. No one of the best ones ever I
[56:21.540 --> 56:23.540]  Can't know
[56:23.780 --> 56:27.300]  Myself in the foot on that, but I'll tell you later. I'm working on another podcast and
[56:27.980 --> 56:29.980]  You alluded to the name?

[57:00.660 --> 57:02.660]  That's definitely how we do it
[57:02.980 --> 57:04.980]  remember seeing
[57:04.980 --> 57:07.800]  Zack Taylor Road should do that you're not a trap artist either though

[57:27.260 --> 57:29.260]  Save a tree kill a trap artist
[57:30.100 --> 57:35.340]  I'm not sure why trap artists and trees. Where does that matter just kill a trap artist?
[57:37.980 --> 57:39.980]  Save a puppy kill a trap artist
[57:40.740 --> 57:46.560]  Tell us how you feel damn. Yeah, Jesse doesn't like trap music. No did your headphones cut out cuz you're
[57:47.220 --> 57:49.220]  Yeah, so I

[58:04.020 --> 58:06.020]  But if you like pull on the wire
[58:12.380 --> 58:16.440]  It's one of the things that me and Jesse literally sat down at the table and we both kind of looked at and said
[58:16.440 --> 58:18.780]  Ha ha you're still using that piece of shit
[58:21.580 --> 58:25.500]  Cuz if I go to Guitar Center, and I tell him this sucks they go oh, you know here's another one try this
[58:26.500 --> 58:33.080]  The upgraded model is the same thing just with like a fancy plastic housing fixing a solution we get bigger problems

[58:36.820 --> 58:42.780]  Like it's a four-way splitter, but it's all molded together. No independent channels. Oh, yeah
[58:42.780 --> 58:46.520]  I like the independent channels cuz I like to crank mine up when I do my show like yeah
[58:47.940 --> 58:52.820]  Yeah, and I mean you got these phones podcast action making that shit go weird

[59:00.540 --> 59:04.060]  We're all digging. I looked up across the room and everyone's got cracked screens
[59:04.980 --> 59:10.380]  mine I had to get my so I did crack a screen like a month ago and
[59:11.820 --> 59:16.780]  That was like a hundred and do really you got that sticker on there man this phone goes away
[59:17.500 --> 59:23.700]  That sticker so fucking cool. You know you know it. You know what this sticker does prevent people from stealing my phone
[59:25.820 --> 59:27.580]  A
[59:27.580 --> 59:29.580]  Couple days ago my phone
[59:29.980 --> 59:31.460]  And I had to go to the Apple Store
[59:31.460 --> 59:35.260]  And they charged me 200 bucks to replace my phone and they wanted a whole bunch more money
[59:35.260 --> 59:39.340]  But I was like I just got the phone the screen replaced so can I get some some love and they hooked me up they?
[59:39.340 --> 59:41.340]  Charged me 200 bucks that sucked
[59:41.940 --> 59:43.940]  That's love you should
[59:44.740 --> 59:50.300]  Yeah, Apple. Yeah, it's Apple dude this Macintosh just fucking close today

[59:56.860 --> 59:58.940]  I've got three three hundred res
[59:58.940 --> 01:00:04.540]  Yeah, three three hundred gallon res is in a room lined up, and then I've got two 55 gallon trash cans on wheels
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:09.940]  They're usually filled with water, then I've got another resin another room try not to have that fucking phone
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.220]  I got a mop bucket
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:16.920]  What about you D because I know you got to work to worry about losing your phone in or probably some some soup no
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.700]  I got a hot wheels at work. Okay, all right
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:25.420]  Where we put the food in I get a mop bucket. That's about my or the toilet you ever deep-fry a phone on X
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:37.460]  I'm sure there's a YouTube video somewhere. I guarantee it
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.900]  That would suck cleaning that fucking fryer out after that
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.180]  Especially if it didn't you didn't know like oh no
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:48.340]  I'm sure whoever we find it's got like some clear fryer that we can see through and they're like here it goes
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.240]  phone ruptures in there wait is this predator
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.280]  Better let's do that Buffalo iPhone
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.060]  That'd be a nice revenge
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.420]  If you want to sponsor my podcast
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.300]  Apple Apple let's talk
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.140]  Colorado

[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:37.980]  Yeah
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:41.540]  We need another MacBook for me because this one's filled with photography and other nonsense
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.020]  I need one to dedicate to the show and one that I could Google with
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:50.940]  Money to research one Jesse's one Adam. Can you use one in your car? No PC kind of guy dude?
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:00.960]  Above my tax bracket I knew one of those new iPads that iPad Pro thing and you could go ahead and send me one of those
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:05.620]  I would use I mean you would definitely get shout outs all the time
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:11.360]  From the garden would be phenomenal with that new I could do metric from the from the garden
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.460]  I wouldn't have to go use the main computer really
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:19.740]  You do metric from an iPad. Hell yeah, that'd be cool. But help out. Yeah. Yeah, you just walk around and do your plants
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.820]  You just carry it with you'd be so much easier
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:26.700]  Trying to have the MacBook or something in the fucking grow with you. Yeah
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:30.380]  Sounds like you need to invest in that. Yeah, so come on guys. Go ahead

[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.420]  It's a water
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.700]  Valiant effort
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:05.380]  Probably the weirdest thing I've ever done
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.900]  This is this is excellent though, I've had a good time
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:20.300]  Intro is the best. I was just kind of testing the waters and I was like, well, that's going
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:25.660]  Fucking editing that out of a podcast. Did you hear us come back from breaking a couple weeks ago?
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.660]  And he thought he was like answering the phone. He's like hello
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.820]  What's going on and he goes hello

[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:16.060]  God
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:23.100]  You know, we've kind of been waiting for it on stitcher I'm on iTunes I'm on stitcher my shows available on my website
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:28.900]  I read genetics colorado.com and my shows available every Wednesday at 1 o'clock on toke radio. That's pretty cool
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:35.700]  Yeah, I hadn't even ever heard about that go to toke radio.com you can listen it's a live feed
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:39.780]  It's just always streaming something's going on. Sometimes Jay jumps in and does live stuff
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:42.260]  He'll just play music based on his his vibe of the day
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:46.860]  I know you're a busy guy now, but is there are you still doing genetics? Yeah, definitely. Okay
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.860]  Well, I just I didn't know if you wanted to plug that to
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:54.020]  Well, I don't have anything available at the time, but I'm making a rise f2s
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:59.180]  Okay, which I'll be all of my testers bust through a bunch of those and then I may put some of those out to the
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:03.220]  Public I definitely like arise a lot. It's such a good stream. We had a really good cut of it
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:08.260]  Yeah, we had like it was like our number three or number five or something like I know I rise number one
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.260]  Is the one you're thinking?
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:12.260]  I know
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:14.100]  Number five was really good, too
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:17.460]  But I bet you're talking about I think it was number one that we kept around for a long time
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.820]  So I mean, I've got some of the early stuff you had
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:25.100]  I've got an amazing boy of that that cross and then I've got girls of that and then I'm gonna put like
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.340]  several females in a room probably like
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:33.940]  Somewhere between 16 and 20 girls and that arise male in a room two of the arise the same male
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:38.580]  Clones of it in the same room and grow them out and fucking hit that pollen on all those plants and make like
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:42.400]  Between 15 and 20 new crosses and test them all out works
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.860]  Now that I think about that arise number one that we had
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.580]  it's
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:53.100]  Your male is the male counterpart to that phenotype nice
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.740]  Just big tall amazing, but it's crazy
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.900]  Yeah, giant, but big big, but yeah
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.540]  Both of the parents
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.300]  Out and out last year, right? Yeah
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:09.860]  The first time we ran that
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:14.540]  Actually, that was two years ago. We also had the black cherry Kim. No, that was last year
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:19.140]  Oh, yeah, when I bread arise, I really expected it to take longer to finish flowering, but I get
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:23.220]  Seven and a half to eight to nine week phenotypes out of that stuff. It's like
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:29.380]  Golden go to a lot there. Yeah, there are a lot of golden goat dominant phenotypes. Yeah, I would think
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.380]  Golden goat on appearances
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.060]  I
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:35.260]  Think a lot of growers if they didn't know what it was
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:41.420]  But they give us a longer flowering string than it actually is that trait actually comes from the Romulan in it because Romulan is from
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:44.140]  Canada those guys bred their shit to finish a little earlier
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:47.500]  They found the earlier finishing sativas and went for that aspect of it
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:52.580]  It's like we were talking to Christian the other day on one of the forums or one of the groups
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:58.460]  Ah, yeah, you auto flowers if you guys want to learn something, please check out the grow from your heart podcast
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:04.540]  I mean, we're Jesse's knowledgeable and Derek is you know, he's got the years underneath his belt and I'm I'm learning as we go
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:09.820]  But like Jeff you've had you've definitely had the the experience for the indoor for years and years and years
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:12.340]  So I get a lot of practice lately. Yeah
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:21.620]  Honestly the two best growers in town are sitting at the table right here. You're the indoor dude and you're the outdoor dude
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.420]  I mean, that's the way it's been on your podcast and that's you know
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:28.100]  So if I was gonna ask a question for somebody
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:32.540]  You're the person I would call friend or and you're the person I would call for our door. So I don't yeah
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:37.180]  Thank you. No, no, it's cool. I'm happy to be a part of all of it, you know, I don't think I'm really worthy
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.420]  Well, I don't know too many outdoor growers either so don't don't
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.260]  Well there
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.580]  Apparently
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:53.540]  Yeah, the Sun will save your ass many a times on a job
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.540]  Yeah
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.980]  Jeff watch my plants
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:04.060]  Live and die and live and die and die like for the first year
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:08.940]  I was here and I was scaring it like it's scrambling to ask you questions and like I was telling him to ask you questions
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:09.980]  I'm shows like
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.220]  What do I do about ants and I was like, I know I'll just cover it in dirt
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.020]  I'm like dude, that was the worst thing I ever did
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:20.740]  I covered it in dirt at like 11 in the afternoon and by 2 they were like literally floppy plants and I was like
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:26.700]  You covered it with sand sand yeah, like that's I remember that yeah, and there was no way for the water to get through
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:33.740]  I watched some asshole color color it cover it in like fine particulate sand that he bought from a store and it was
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.340]  I've seen people do that to
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:40.100]  Get rid of Nats. Yes. I've tried it before
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:44.700]  It's a pain in the fucking ass but outdoors and a root bound container
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:49.660]  That is so root bound is drying out every day and they were in a five gallon bucket
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:54.620]  No, they were in earth pots, but they were definitely drying out every day
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:00.300]  I'd wake up at 10 o'clock and be like, holy shit. What's wrong? Did you hear that? Did you hear that you guys?
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.300]  I would wake up at 10 o'clock
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.060]  Do you know what I've done by 10 o'clock in the morning?
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.820]  And I work at a pipe shop
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:17.820]  All day like I'm sorry man, like there's different there's different spectrums
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:22.080]  He like he just told me today. He's like man. You really need to try for your badge. I was like, I'd love to but I mean
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:28.340]  In ten years, so
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.580]  I mean and none of my charges
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:38.180]  Until way way back when I was judicated as an adult. I have anything to do with any kind of like drugs drugs
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.180]  Yeah, so I mean violence. Yeah
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.420]  Shittery just pure
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:45.020]  I
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:50.580]  Was a dumb kid when I was 19. No shit, you know, like give me a fucking break. So dip shittery
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:53.540]  I think your 19 year old self still shines through
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:57.300]  I play a good fool
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:00.060]  You know 44 is actually 20
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.260]  I wish that was true, but
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.700]  No, I sure wouldn't
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.700]  No, no, no, I learned my lesson on them 20 year old
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.700]  Unfortunately, I haven't so
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:22.500]  Fuck no, I don't I thought we had that conversation early
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.060]  Really weird I think in my next episode
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:31.200]  I'm gonna talk about how to take care of fungus gnats and like soil borne pests and stuff like that
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:37.100]  What am I listen or send an email? So I'm glad that you said fungus gnats. Don't use fucking sand. Yeah
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.700]  Yeah, just yeah, it worked but it I think it caused more
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:47.060]  Suffocates everything and then yeah. Yeah, this was on an organic grow. I like growing in Coco show everything
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:49.060]  I've been growing in cocoa lately. Oh
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:52.100]  Coco's red cocoa is nice 100% cocoa
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.820]  That's there are things mixed into my cocoa because that's what we've we've purchased it
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:57.820]  We still have the shit and I mix it in just because it works
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:03.220]  But eventually straight up we've mixed quite a bit of coke and things too. I believe along the way
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:06.500]  Oh, yeah, like where we done the first run in cocoa and then we were like, yeah, fuck that
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:11.060]  So, yeah, we've we've had cocoa to mix heavily
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.780]  I'm doing a home in Cocoa right now
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.380]  Pure cocoa. Yeah, I like it. Well to her
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:21.140]  Okay, I mean it's got a little form-casting
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:25.060]  Yeah
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.860]  We both came to the same conclusion to yeah
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:36.220]  Fucking yeah the head cold
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.980]  Mills
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:47.060]  Okay, I just know you have I'm just giving them to space Mills and key badges
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:57.820]  What was the last one he said OG bio or OG bio, okay
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:04.340]  So I'm just gonna do that as a like a base test though. Would you buy a war crushes? Oh, yeah
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:09.620]  I've been using it since it was called caps beneficials actually. Yeah
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.580]  When you could order it from the dude on the fucking
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:24.500]  He goes back up for yeah, it was on THC farmer
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:30.540]  Pages way back in the day, bro. Yeah, remember when he had to do shit on IRC. Mm-hmm
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.220]  No, I don't remember IRC sadly
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:34.220]  I remember IRC through anarchy online
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:39.500]  but that was my experience with IRC because I mean I played anarchy online for 12 years dude like that was
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.700]  Those years of my wife life that I wasted
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:52.500]  That was so bad with him because he goes to Benson and Vincent so bond point with that
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:57.140]  I'm like here. Hold up get a picture with me and my wife and he's like, oh, yeah. I'm giving it to you
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.820]  so then my plan is is
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:05.780]  I'm gonna do another run after it with the exact same thing. I'm gonna add teased to it once a week
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:14.060]  Okay, and just see you know, yeah compare final product. Yeah. Yeah, we're doing a side-by-side comparison with two different nutrient brands right now
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:19.660]  Oh now your shit's cut now. I touched it now. I touch it again and fucking killed it again wiggle it again
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.380]  Can you hear me can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:26.420]  Quit touching it
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:30.740]  So we're running and we're gonna retire one brand so I think I could talk about it
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:34.540]  I don't know. I'm not sure what I'm allowed to talk about really because some of it's like confidential, but we're testing
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.900]  I've talked about it on Facebook
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:40.660]  We've got veg bloom in one tank and we're on week one like three or what's today Thursday?
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:45.580]  So we're four days in the plants look fucking happy. It's like but I mean we're in cocoa
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:48.860]  So I'm sure I would see something by now if they were not happy and they get fed
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:51.260]  They're on a cycle so they get fed multiple times a day
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:55.900]  So they're getting plenty of opportunity to show me if they're happy or not. Yeah, they look really really good
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:03.520]  I've always been intrigued by the I mean I'm an organic grower also because of the simplicity, right?
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:09.420]  But so I've always been intrigued by the simplicity of it. It's all they send you like four powders and one liquid
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.900]  You weigh them out by the gram like there's so much per
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:19.740]  Gallon so many grams per gallon just weigh it out on a scale and just pour it in there and stir it real real well
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:23.500]  And just let it go. I just let the reservoirs I put huge pumps in the rest
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:27.280]  They fucking spin real well the water is cyclone in there all the time our water
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:34.620]  Unfortunately, it's hard to produce that much our water. Can I can I fill you in a little secret there? Let's hear it, buddy
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:42.820]  Walmart has our water for a dollar fifty nine a gallon. Have you go in there and fill up waters?
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:46.820]  Well, like like gallon bottles. It's 89 cents water station. You can get
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:50.940]  Okay, well, I'm just saying like why you're everywhere. So
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:54.660]  You know, I'm not trying to pitch Walmart, but they have
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:57.740]  gallons this morning the cost alone
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:03.300]  Well, yeah, I mean if you're doing it yours, all right, you know what I use a thousand gallons of water
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:07.060]  I was thinking for the listeners. Well, you know what thousand gallons of water every other day
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.540]  We're in the same
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:13.180]  With him have him just back the truck in and be like use water, bro
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:17.980]  Actually
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:19.740]  Veg bloom actually sent us a mix
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:25.440]  They sent us a two-part mix that I use half one and half the other and it balances the pH and adjust for my
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:30.660]  I've tested the water and sent them some water tests. They sent us a formula for design for our water
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:33.100]  So I mean it changes across the town
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.060]  Six five if I mix it, right
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.460]  Thursday so the tank was getting about halfway down
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:43.580]  So I just threw the hose in there and filled it up with water and let it spin it totally six five
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.300]  Yeah, the tank was all the way to the top. That's still at six point five
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:50.020]  That would have been cool
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:59.180]  Organics great, but I mean, yeah, it took time. This is sustainable to use one fucking product, you know
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:01.820]  For four packages
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:07.580]  It sounds like our kind of style of growing to a very simple and simplistic
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:12.220]  And with the this is more the round a lot of the stuff growing green and healthy I used
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:21.300]  Six bottles total and the flowering cycle like total like and that's a be like a big flood system
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:23.300]  Right that like runs back and forth or?
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:29.740]  Yes, I mean I don't I don't want to give away your secret I know they're tiered right is what I'm saying
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:34.780]  No, it's just tables at an angle. Okay tables flood flood tables at an angle with pots with cocoa
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:39.340]  Essentially with a sprinkler in each pot. This is what I saw. I knew it seemed like they were at an angle
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.820]  You know Sam's a gigantic version of my little greenhouse man

[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:34.340]  It's all the life of real life. We choose. Yeah the life before I had a pump
[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:37.460]  You know those like this is go where you know the pump that you would use

[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:18.820]  gallon tank
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:21.460]  I use one of those and then I put some hose on it
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:24.300]  And then I run the hose to something and clamp the host of something so it stays in place
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:28.820]  I could hear it slipping out like the hose was creeping while it was pumping
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:31.020]  And I ran to it to grab it and it came out
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:35.460]  This hose shot water up my shorts up my balls
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:41.420]  Like how did that even go there like I was like well that was a little undercarriage rinses
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:47.320]  Hashtag Colorado problems went up my shirt got stuck in my shirt for a brief second
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.880]  I tried to grab it and couldn't catch it it slipped out it went back up and hit me in the chin

[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.800]  All I could do was like reach to find the plug to turn off that fucking hose. It was fun
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.800]  So today I solved it by fucking
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.840]  ice
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.840]  drilling a hole in the side of the
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:12.720]  Because then wouldn't the res leak if I put a hole in it now
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.200]  I put a tube coming out of it
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.240]  I took a cinder block and I fucking zip tied the hose to a cinder block and I was like
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.120]  I'm gonna do this fucking Italian style in the fucking water
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.040]  Tie a brick and drop in the bottom of it
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.040]  Forget about it
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.680]  They looked funny when I went to Lowe's and bought a bunch of zip ties
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:55.160]  This crazy bitch looking at me like I just killed somebody I might have bitch don't cross the line you want to get in the car
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:02.000]  Measuring cinder blocks a3 should be enough. Yeah, do you think this would like say keep?
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:07.280]  A hose down to say if I really needed to keep it down like it was life imperative
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:13.160]  You can't talk about cannabis so you have to be real vague
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:16.680]  No, the old man at Lowe's asked me what I was trying to do and I said I needed some cinder blocks to keep my
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:18.680]  hose underwater
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:29.440]  All right, yep, all right, all right, all right, all right, okay

[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.720]  I got that Joe Rogan bladder. Oh, you ever listen to Joe Rogan?
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:53.600]  He's like I don't I went with you to see Joe Rogan. They wouldn't let us up or order food or drinks. We couldn't do shit
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.480]  He was recording a fucking comedy special, bro
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.920]  By himself he got first-class service. Yeah
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:05.360]  And he did put in the front row. He went with me. They were like, yeah pretty girl, but
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.880]  No ain't happening no, no
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:14.760]  we got we got put like middle row like right underneath the other like it was right as the
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:21.220]  The audience stepped up like that that step that I was directly under the camera is how far back
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:26.740]  Very back camera was right above my head and that cameraman had to view over my head
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:30.220]  So Joe Rogan was telling jokes to that camera and it looked like he was talking to me on it
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:34.200]  It was kind of nice and he did the vegan and the Grateful Dead joke right at me
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:38.780]  Yeah, I was pretty freaky
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.980]  Good time. I catch a lot of shit for that
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:44.360]  But that was well worth getting in trouble for that was one of those moments that like
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:49.020]  You just gotta say fuck it and go do it. Yeah, and it was worth it
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:53.740]  That was a very memorable experience you're a grown-ass man, you can get in trouble no
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:58.220]  Go are you you're still getting shit for that? Yeah, absolutely

[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:06.740]  Did you collect any evidence and he's here?
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:11.700]  No, no your honor I did not and I was like case closed in right
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:17.340]  Literally exactly what I did and everybody laughed in the courtroom and then they played the video and it's like he honor
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:20.420]  I'm just a grown man living in the car trying to keep my pussy warm
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:27.220]  And everybody laughed in the courtroom and he'd that the fucking the cops like just fighting it dude

[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:09.060]  It's no way it's gonna go on ours in one episode. We're gonna have to cut it. We can get it on the website
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:12.700]  Oh, yeah, we can do that like a special episode just run the website or something
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:16.740]  If you want me to edit it down to a solid hour, you know, no, I could put it up on SoundCloud
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:20.380]  We could do it as two episodes in one week. I mean just
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:25.460]  Let's let's not argue about this while we're wasting precious time
