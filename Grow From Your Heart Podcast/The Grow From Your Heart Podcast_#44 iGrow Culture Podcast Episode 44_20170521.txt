[09:52.730 --> 09:56.530]  I own that my buddy Tony and I built that Tony built it. I drew it in crayon
[09:56.530 --> 09:58.170]  Yeah, pretty much on a paper
[09:58.170 --> 09:58.530]  I was like
[09:58.530 --> 10:02.210]  this is what I want the home page to look like and then I drew tabs at the top and then I was like this is
[10:02.210 --> 10:06.890]  What I want the second page to look like and he kind of did my vision. It's a work in progress, you know
[10:06.890 --> 10:11.890]  But for what I drew he nailed it. I joined it when you first launched it. I think so
[10:12.250 --> 10:14.250]  All I've done as well

[11:22.730 --> 11:25.610]  Like you guys tell them that you're listening to the podcast home
[11:25.610 --> 11:31.650]  The people are here in Colorado or supporting them and not as they've actually commented on the podcast that they listen. That's awesome. There may be
[11:32.650 --> 11:34.650]  Well, that's what I'm saying
[11:34.930 --> 11:38.170]  We may have a wormy sponsor here in the I never heard of it, you know

[11:42.370 --> 11:46.930]  But then they blasted it on the podcast. So, you know, it's not held secret, but it's just you got to know
[11:47.490 --> 11:49.970]  Secrets. That's all Sean's I brought that to the table
[11:50.210 --> 11:53.210]  Also, I want to give a huge shout out to everybody from the Garden of Wheaton
[11:53.210 --> 11:56.130]  I mentioned that the Garden of Wheaton may be on here
[11:56.930 --> 11:59.250]  to talk about their secret cup experience
[12:00.130 --> 12:03.010]  They just got back from Vegas they had a great time
[12:03.010 --> 12:08.930]  Unfortunately, they did not take home the trophy some coastal guys won some guys from the coast which you know, you can handle that
[12:08.930 --> 12:12.410]  They're not bitter about it. Although they were busy. The Garden of Wheaton was a little bit busy
[12:12.410 --> 12:16.110]  I was over there hanging out today and I was like you want to come on the show and they kind of showed me what
[12:16.110 --> 12:20.250]  They had to take care of and kind of hinted at me that today was not the day to come on a podcast
[12:20.250 --> 12:24.290]  So in the future, we'll have spins. Hopefully we can get Maddie over Maddie's never been on the show
[12:24.290 --> 12:26.290]  I don't think no she hasn't we gotta get Maddie over
[12:26.290 --> 12:30.150]  Maybe big come first female on the show be the first female on the show
[12:30.150 --> 12:35.410]  Yeah, so it'd be an honor to have it either Maddie or Angela and I've invited Angela and she doesn't seem excited to talk on
[12:35.410 --> 12:40.650]  The show. Yeah, which is understandable if you're not a podcast person, that's cool. But busy is the word of the week
[12:41.050 --> 12:45.810]  Everybody's been slamming busy the couple of weeks just to get everybody to pull out of their lives for an hour to come do the
[12:45.810 --> 12:50.410]  Podcast was not only that but let's look at you know, like he'd been sick just there before so he's been

[13:07.130 --> 13:09.130]  He was talking about some of the banging food
[13:09.330 --> 13:13.610]  They said that a French toast at some place and I was like, let's get a car bro. Let's just go
[13:14.370 --> 13:17.570]  Make some bomb French toast. See we'll go over to Jesse's later
[13:17.570 --> 13:22.090]  I want to send a huge shout out to Joey Joey got a hoodie from me today and I hadn't seen Joey in a long
[13:22.090 --> 13:25.810]  Time so it's kind of nice to hook up with Joey get him a hoodie. You're gonna look sharp in that hoodie
[13:26.210 --> 13:28.930]  I'm wrapping up shout outs. I know I got a lot of them here at the start of the show
[13:28.930 --> 13:34.250]  It's easier to get him out of the way much respect and much. Thanks and much love to Mike Adam and Angela
[13:34.730 --> 13:41.770]  They trimmed their little fingers off. Oh my god. Well Angela's little fingers might have normal size. She's beastly at it, though
[13:41.890 --> 13:44.610]  She I don't know how the little chick tries faster than anybody else
[13:44.610 --> 13:49.690]  I know Angela is I will say it on the air Angela is the fastest trimmer I've ever fucking known
[13:49.690 --> 13:52.330]  There's one guy I know that might keep up but he takes Adderall
[13:56.410 --> 14:01.290]  You can't compete if you're enhancing, you know, yeah, well she's taking she's dabbing so yeah
[14:03.570 --> 14:08.890]  Giving people shit also huge shots Angela is involved in this shout out again, but huge shout out to Angela

[14:11.410 --> 14:16.450]  Everybody over at the spot. I got to give you a huge shout out to the spot dispensary in Pueblo West, Colorado
[14:17.010 --> 14:21.530]  They've treated me super kind we've been in a couple of talks a couple of meetings some things have happened I
[14:22.330 --> 14:26.570]  Think I'm ready to make the official announcement today in the mail. I received my Colorado med badge
[14:26.570 --> 14:30.930]  I am now officially legally licensed to work in a Colorado medical marijuana facility
[14:30.930 --> 14:34.250]  Which means that at this time I can take the job that I have been offered
[14:34.250 --> 14:37.530]  I am now the official master grower at the spot in Pueblo, Colorado
[14:38.170 --> 14:40.170]  So within the next few months
[14:40.570 --> 14:44.790]  There's a little bit of work to be done on the grow site to get it up to what I want what we are expecting
[14:45.230 --> 14:48.990]  There are over 200 lights in there. I'll be the master grower for those 200 lights
[14:49.590 --> 14:53.950]  Which means that in probably I'm gonna say six months. I want to give myself six months
[14:53.950 --> 14:58.790]  You guys will see fire coming out of there produced by Rasta Jeff out of the spot in Pueblo, Colorado
[14:59.230 --> 15:03.430]  Way cool. Way cool. I'm excited to announce that when I'm proud to be a part of that team
[15:03.430 --> 15:08.310]  I was a little picky about where I wanted to go what I wanted to do a couple of people have offered me things
[15:08.310 --> 15:12.330]  I like their grow and I get along with the people there
[15:12.330 --> 15:18.650]  So it'll be a great great thing to do. My girlfriend is the bud tender. I am the master grower
[15:18.970 --> 15:20.610]  My girlfriend is the trimmer also
[15:20.610 --> 15:26.250]  So it'll go from it'll have my love in it all the way from the seed or the clone all the way up to the
[15:26.250 --> 15:32.650]  Time it reaches the customer and or patients container. So it's gonna have Rasta Jeff love from beginning to end now
[15:32.650 --> 15:33.870]  So yeah, I'm proud to work with the spot
[15:33.870 --> 15:37.250]  That's my big announcement that I've been kind of teasing about on social media and stuff
[15:37.970 --> 15:41.610]  I want to compliment the Colorado MED in Springs
[15:42.010 --> 15:46.170]  Everybody made it sound like it was a big deal to go get your med badge and it was a pain in the ass
[15:46.170 --> 15:47.410]  I did have a couple of things
[15:47.410 --> 15:50.650]  I had a tax issue from my past that I had to clear up and I had to get a
[15:51.330 --> 15:54.010]  Noted paper that my child support was current and cleaned up
[15:54.130 --> 15:57.170]  But I already did that because I knew that was coming and they never asked for it
[15:57.170 --> 16:00.610]  But they said that they would they never asked for those papers. I went in there
[16:00.610 --> 16:02.890]  I so in Colorado Springs are able to call and make an appointment
[16:03.210 --> 16:08.490]  The hardest part is getting the appointment call every day until you get an appointment because I had to call three times in a row
[16:08.490 --> 16:13.930]  They called me back after the third one. I set an appointment. I got there early. She saw I was early
[16:13.930 --> 16:19.810]  She took me right when I got there. Boom. She got me out of there within 30 minutes. My full appointment was 30 minutes
[16:20.890 --> 16:24.650]  Giving her the paper. She reviewed the paper and it's one lady. That's there all the time
[16:24.650 --> 16:29.130]  I wish I could remember her name. I was excited and anxious. So I don't even know what she looks like to tell you the truth
[16:29.690 --> 16:34.290]  You go into that fucking concert mode, you know, I mean, I just want to see this and get it done med lady
[16:34.330 --> 16:35.930]  Yes med lady. She was awesome
[16:35.930 --> 16:38.570]  But they take your fingerprints on the digital finger printer
[16:38.570 --> 16:43.330]  which is kind of fun and then they run all your background checks and then they take a picture of you and she high-fives you
[16:43.330 --> 16:48.210]  And tells you have a good day and that happened Tuesday at 11 o'clock today when I got my mail
[16:48.210 --> 16:51.470]  It is Thursday as we record my med badge came in the mail today
[16:51.530 --> 16:56.370]  So my background check my tax thing all my child support my fingerprints everything got done
[16:56.930 --> 17:02.990]  Probably within five or six hours. It's great hands down the the fastest turned turnover rate
[17:02.990 --> 17:07.190]  I've heard of I went prepared I went with everything I needed because I called an ass
[17:07.190 --> 17:11.530]  I was like, what am I gonna need? I have like I have a small business. I have child support
[17:11.530 --> 17:15.570]  Do I need to she's like as long as your child support is current you can prove it and as long as your taxes are
[17:15.570 --> 17:20.290]  Good on your small business and I was like, I got that watch nice just had to I they never asked for proof
[17:20.290 --> 17:25.890]  I guess they probably could tell just by yeah, I do some most of their app their application was 13 pages
[17:25.890 --> 17:28.130]  I think seven of those pages are you signing?
[17:28.590 --> 17:33.450]  writing your name signing and dating saying that this agency can go through all of my shit and
[17:33.650 --> 17:35.930]  This agency can go through all of my shit
[17:35.930 --> 17:42.210]  And if I missed anything this other agency can go through all the other shit and it's like everything but your medical records get reviewed
[17:42.210 --> 17:44.210]  I think your money
[17:46.570 --> 17:49.610]  She puts on a rubber glove and says you want to come back here with me and they're just
[17:49.850 --> 17:52.370]  Fingerprinting you at that point. I was like they're going that far
[17:52.370 --> 17:54.370]  That's
[17:54.410 --> 17:58.890]  Why everybody talks about how bad it is, maybe they're getting the wrong treatment up there
[17:58.890 --> 18:02.090]  Maybe you were just nice. Maybe I cannot say I had that experience
[18:02.850 --> 18:10.070]  No, but I got mine right before the first of the year last year. So I bet that there was a lot of people
[18:10.810 --> 18:16.530]  Yeah, well now it brings you can make appointments. Yeah, and they're kind of sticklers. They'll will tell you if you miss your appointment
[18:16.530 --> 18:18.530]  It'll be a while before you can get back
[18:18.810 --> 18:20.810]  List and you're like, oh shit
[18:20.890 --> 18:25.050]  So you got it? Yeah, and I was I'm prepared. I left an hour and a half early to get to
[18:26.410 --> 18:33.190]  45 minute drive my puppy ate my badge. So oops, it's 10 bucks for a replacement. I don't think you need an appointment for that
[18:35.050 --> 18:40.250]  Shit okay, they do not take cash you guys if you ever go into the med go get a money order for the total
[18:40.250 --> 18:42.650]  Oh, that's changed. Yeah, that's anything pretty much here
[18:43.650 --> 18:46.930]  Like that office in Springs isn't in a shitty area
[18:46.930 --> 18:51.310]  But parts of Springs right near like Colorado Springs on one side of the street is gorgeous
[18:51.310 --> 18:53.830]  The other side of the street you're like, I don't want to fucking park my car here
[18:53.930 --> 18:59.170]  And they're kind of in one of those like off to the side areas. They could be I wouldn't wreck I'm not saying this
[18:59.170 --> 19:02.810]  They could easily be a victim of robbery or something. I'm not saying go do it
[19:02.810 --> 19:05.050]  I'm saying they could so it's wise that they don't keep a lot of cash
[19:05.050 --> 19:12.050]  Yeah, and my badge alone was 300 bucks and they probably do 20 appointments a day at 150 or 300
[19:12.650 --> 19:14.650]  Appointment price went up for that. Yeah
[19:14.650 --> 19:18.330]  Yeah, it's 150 for the key or 150 for the support and 300 for the key
[19:18.330 --> 19:23.710]  I did get the key cuz I'm the guy the prices doubled. Yeah. Yeah, and if you're upgrading badges
[19:23.710 --> 19:28.250]  It's still like 253 bucks to go from one to the other like you should have just paid that in the beginning
[19:28.250 --> 19:31.870]  So guys if you're curious if you need to get the big badge or the little one if you can afford it
[19:31.870 --> 19:34.650]  Just get the big one. Yeah. Yeah, it makes you a
[19:35.290 --> 19:39.010]  More valuable asset to you can actually ask for more pay if you yeah
[19:40.130 --> 19:42.130]  Yeah
[19:42.170 --> 19:45.690]  That'd be a good episode kind of well, I guess we just did it
[19:51.370 --> 19:58.130]  Back up a couple steps if you guys want to apply to be able to work in the medical marijuana industry in the marijuana industry
[19:58.130 --> 20:02.250]  You can take the medical word out if you want to be employed in any way in the marijuana industry in Colorado
[20:02.250 --> 20:04.250]  what you need to do is go to
[20:06.090 --> 20:11.350]  There's a website's the Department of Revenue, Colorado Department of Revenue and there will be marijuana
[20:12.290 --> 20:15.870]  Documents on their print out the application for it's a med
[20:16.650 --> 20:21.410]  Employment application and it's not the business application. It's only the one for
[20:22.050 --> 20:25.130]  An employment it'll say key or support which is how you know
[20:25.130 --> 20:26.050]  If you're doing the right ones
[20:26.050 --> 20:31.930]  You want that just go for that key or support if if you don't want to be like a manager or something if you just want
[20:31.930 --> 20:33.770]  To trim or bud tend all you need is a support
[20:33.770 --> 20:36.690]  but if you want to get paid a little more and if you want to have some chance of
[20:37.250 --> 20:41.250]  Climbing up that corporate ladder get that that big one get that support then
[20:42.050 --> 20:45.570]  They always have to have a support badge on-premises
[20:45.890 --> 20:50.530]  So if boss needs to go somewhere, maybe you can step up and show that you can do that shit
[20:50.530 --> 20:53.810]  That's how people advance so go on the website print out that application
[20:53.850 --> 20:56.730]  Read it thoroughly before you even start printing because there's one page
[20:56.850 --> 21:00.450]  That says if any of this stuff applies to you go fuck yourself
[21:00.450 --> 21:06.810]  It pretty much says if you did this you cannot get a badge it straight up. No, no, like just read your application now
[21:07.810 --> 21:12.330]  Primarily it's kind of the same stuff as getting into the military. Yeah
[21:13.210 --> 21:18.410]  No drug felonies. Yeah, no drug felonies is their main one. Yeah, I should have had the list here
[21:18.410 --> 21:20.410]  But I didn't realize we're gonna have this conversation
[21:20.610 --> 21:24.730]  I mean all that's all that's there and it's basically
[21:25.610 --> 21:27.610]  Common sense at that point. Yeah
[21:28.010 --> 21:34.170]  So if you can if you're in another state or what just to clarify like this means like to work behind a counter
[21:34.530 --> 21:38.450]  Selling herb to people to selling cannabis legally, right?
[21:38.490 --> 21:44.290]  Now this doesn't mean you can't live in Colorado and can't have three plants or six plants, whatever the state
[21:46.130 --> 21:48.610]  You can still be a caregiver you can grow your own
[21:48.610 --> 21:53.130]  This is just to work in a regulated shop become part of the industry and right right now
[21:53.130 --> 21:58.090]  I hate saying this but it's what I feel and what I part of why I'm making the business decisions
[21:58.090 --> 21:59.250]  I'm making so I think that in the future
[21:59.410 --> 22:04.190]  I read genetics will be able to breed inside of this large facility that I've just been
[22:04.970 --> 22:08.130]  Became master grower of and right now if I don't make a move like that
[22:08.650 --> 22:13.130]  The way that I'm growing in the way that my business model works. I think the industry will squeeze me right out
[22:13.130 --> 22:17.750]  I either need to join it or get squeezed out of it. And this is my way to join it and not disappear
[22:17.750 --> 22:20.410]  I want to be here for the long haul. Well, I've thought about this
[22:20.410 --> 22:25.890]  I feel like I'm selling out a little bit, but I'd rather give then not exist at all. That's what I got to do
[22:26.730 --> 22:31.170]  Yeah, so alright guys if you get that application fill it out if you're not in Colorado
[22:31.330 --> 22:34.370]  You got to come to Colorado and you have to show initiative
[22:34.370 --> 22:37.130]  You have to go to a bunch of dispensaries and apply in person
[22:37.130 --> 22:42.490]  You have to be kind of persistent almost being an asshole about it because so many people apply every day if you're a hot chick
[22:42.490 --> 22:46.290]  You're gonna get in don't worry about it. You have to know a little bit about cannabis
[22:48.170 --> 22:49.450]  Come with some knowledge
[22:49.450 --> 22:54.970]  Showed and be willing to start at a shitty job be willing to clean the toilets and trim pot for eight hours a day
[22:55.250 --> 23:01.650]  Because that's what we need. Mostly. We need trimmers trimmers get paid decently here and be dependable, please. Yeah
[23:02.130 --> 23:06.010]  There's such a high turnover rate in this industry is ridiculous
[23:06.010 --> 23:10.010]  Don't bring that kind of looks bad about don't brag about your trimming ability
[23:10.010 --> 23:13.130]  Don't tell me you can trim a pound and show up and not be able to trim it all
[23:13.130 --> 23:16.170]  We'll fire you while you're on your phone while you're on your phone all day
[23:16.410 --> 23:21.730]  There are so many people there are so many people from around the world that want in this industry
[23:22.250 --> 23:27.610]  Performed a top-notch will fire you they I can't say we I just got into this shit. I moved here. I'll fire you
[23:27.610 --> 23:29.610]  You know like I can tell you firsthand
[23:29.610 --> 23:36.250]  Like if you don't there's plenty of people that hit the you know hit the wall every day and then they get paid and they're just
[23:36.250 --> 23:40.650]  Like I'm I'm rich and I you know, I'm around marijuana all day and it's like nope
[23:41.730 --> 23:49.290]  They just drop out like flies. I mean it's uh, it may be a cool job, but it is still very much a job
[23:50.250 --> 23:54.570]  I visit dispensaries here in town and when I go in there every week and
[23:56.130 --> 24:03.610]  Nobody's there or it's different people in there every week different employees. Yeah, no customers that will plenty of customers, especially
[24:03.850 --> 24:07.530]  You know recreational and stuff like that. There's there's always lines
[24:08.210 --> 24:13.230]  I've been going to the spot for a couple of reasons recently mostly to talk to the owners out there and the bosses and to
[24:13.230 --> 24:18.490]  See if we can negotiate and also my favorite person a second favorite person. I have a daughter. Sorry girlfriend
[24:18.490 --> 24:21.030]  You're second the daughter comes first. I'm just kind of picking on you
[24:21.030 --> 24:25.050]  But she's out there and I go out there to visit her and go take her lunch or just go see what's up and dude
[24:25.050 --> 24:27.570]  It's hard for her to get away from the counter because they've got business
[24:27.570 --> 24:33.570]  Yeah, it's you're not gonna go and sit down behind a counter and be like socializing with people you would you would think that you know
[24:33.570 --> 24:39.010]  You still have to have customer service, but it's you have 14 people out and I'm the lobby waiting, you know
[24:39.010 --> 24:43.410]  I told the bosses there that I don't want a bud tend. I said no I'd rather not be a bud tender
[24:43.410 --> 24:46.130]  I just rather stick with being the grower, you know, cuz it'll be downtime for me
[24:46.210 --> 24:49.850]  But I think once in a while just for fun and I'll announce it on the podcast
[24:49.850 --> 24:52.290]  I'll be like hey guys, and I'm not I don't mean this right now
[24:52.290 --> 24:55.290]  You guys this is just hypothetical and I'm not even gonna say it like a real sentence
[24:55.290 --> 24:56.410]  I'll say on this day
[24:56.410 --> 24:58.410]  I will be bud tending at the spot
[24:58.530 --> 25:04.450]  If you guys want to come and buy some capel tin from Ross to Jeff you mentioned the agriculture podcast will give you 10% off
[25:04.970 --> 25:09.450]  That's cool. Yeah, that shit's gonna be happening pretty soon. That's kind of the kind of stuff that we have in mind
[25:09.450 --> 25:14.330]  But tending is kind of fun. I like people I really love before so that's how I start
[25:14.330 --> 25:16.370]  Yeah, that's how I got my foot in the medical industry
[25:16.370 --> 25:17.050]  I was well
[25:17.050 --> 25:19.050]  I started helping transplant somebody
[25:19.050 --> 25:23.930]  Helping somebody transplant that had their own shop and too many plants who couldn't handle it and I saw him struggling
[25:23.930 --> 25:26.170]  I was like you need help. He's like, you know how I was like fuck you
[25:26.970 --> 25:30.790]  He's like grab a bucket do this and he was older than me
[25:30.790 --> 25:35.330]  So I was able to work circles around him and he's like come back tomorrow and I'll pay you and he gave me way more
[25:35.330 --> 25:37.330]  Than I expected and that was for the rest of the week
[25:37.330 --> 25:41.010]  So this works kind of how I got my first job
[25:41.450 --> 25:46.450]  So guys, I guess that's the point go show that you can do some work. Don't show initiative show some initiative
[25:46.970 --> 25:51.570]  It is the way it's the weed industry. Why right? So you're gonna think I can show up with my long hair down
[25:51.570 --> 25:54.570]  I don't need to take a shower. I could put on my Grateful Dead shirt my fucked up jeans
[25:55.210 --> 25:57.290]  And you can you can you work?
[25:57.890 --> 26:01.810]  But it may you still got to treat it like a real job interview. We want you to be able to work
[26:02.650 --> 26:06.610]  If I I'm saying we because I've got my own cannabis business. I own a seed company
[26:06.610 --> 26:11.130]  I guess I can qualify I'd rather you kind of just show up and maybe show some help
[26:11.130 --> 26:11.630]  Yeah
[26:11.630 --> 26:16.650]  I got you know like and you wouldn't if somebody would come in and sit at the table and not do anything the whole time and
[26:16.890 --> 26:19.850]  Not show any initiative then they probably wouldn't be there
[26:20.210 --> 26:22.130]  That's why the trimmers that were here
[26:22.130 --> 26:24.890]  there were three tremors here for like four nights in a row and
[26:25.130 --> 26:29.610]  That's kind of stressful to have for all three of those people to take four nights out of their lives and get a trim pot
[26:29.610 --> 26:32.530]  For me with me helping them. I could have called two or three other people
[26:33.010 --> 26:38.850]  But I liked and trusted everybody here, yeah, and I could have driven to the store and came back and nothing would have gone wrong
[26:38.850 --> 26:42.930]  That's why I keep the people that I keep it's that's what it's about trust you be trustworthy
[26:42.930 --> 26:48.650]  You know like and be kind of you're not if you're working in the weed industry industry. We want some clean people
[26:49.170 --> 26:54.610]  You're around stuff that people are consuming and the MED is a stickler for dirtiness
[26:54.810 --> 26:58.690]  Jesse just shook his head and rolled his eyes because he knows the MED is kind of a bitch
[26:58.690 --> 27:04.210]  I love you guys for giving me my my badge, but you guys have some crazy fucked up rules Wow shots fired
[27:06.130 --> 27:09.690]  All right, we've been talking a lot about a lot of good news I do have some semi sad news
[27:09.690 --> 27:11.690]  I hope you guys are ready for this
[27:12.090 --> 27:15.850]  There is rumor that the podcast will receive a cease and desist letter
[27:16.370 --> 27:19.830]  We can continue to podcast but not under the name. I grow culture
[27:20.810 --> 27:23.770]  Nobody has sent me anything yet a lot of businesses and
[27:24.250 --> 27:31.570]  Podcasts and YouTube and Facebook and Instagram things have been being forewarned that a business called I grow which is a college
[27:32.210 --> 27:38.470]  Institution that does college horticultural stuff is coming after people using the I grow moniker
[27:39.410 --> 27:41.010]  I've no problem changing the name
[27:41.010 --> 27:44.010]  I just want to do it slowly if it does happen and I kind of want to do it
[27:44.370 --> 27:46.370]  preemptively before I actually get a
[27:46.530 --> 27:50.130]  Cease and desist letter in the mail or email to me or however, it's gonna happen
[27:50.370 --> 27:54.510]  I think it just be responsible and kind I don't if that's their name and they've got it
[27:54.510 --> 27:57.010]  I don't really feel like I want to rip them off. I just thought it was cute
[27:57.010 --> 27:58.410]  My buddy Kevin and I came up with it
[27:58.410 --> 28:03.450]  I was like it's like I wanted to use the I because it's the the modern I grow I for an iPod
[28:03.450 --> 28:06.570]  It's yeah, and it's the I world and it's I grow you're listening
[28:06.570 --> 28:10.370]  You're learning to grow from me on your iPhone and it's it's a play on the word
[28:10.810 --> 28:15.330]  Agriculture is what we thought also. Yeah, so it's the I grow culture, but we're gonna have to change it
[28:15.330 --> 28:19.010]  I already know what the name will become if it I haven't decided for sure that I want to do it
[28:19.010 --> 28:24.610]  I may just do it on December 1st. We'll go I grow culture slash this podcast for a month or two
[28:25.490 --> 28:27.410]  Used to it. Yeah. Yeah, no
[28:27.410 --> 28:30.030]  But we may have to change the name you guys it'll still be the same show
[28:30.410 --> 28:34.590]  Nothing's gonna change but the logo and the title. Hey bender if you're listening, bro
[28:34.590 --> 28:38.450]  The new title of the show will be the grow from your heart podcast
[28:38.610 --> 28:41.290]  All right, I could I could just relate that to him
[28:41.290 --> 28:45.190]  But all right, you know, you know with the listeners if you guys are listening now and this shit disappears
[28:45.190 --> 28:48.970]  Look for the grow from your heart podcast. It's the same thing. It'll be the same feat
[28:49.010 --> 28:54.650]  So nothing will change all you can type in the title on the feed and change the feed in my my website stuff
[28:54.890 --> 29:00.130]  Everything will be legit. I'll stay the same other than the words. So that bender help me out, bro

[30:42.170 --> 30:45.570]  Yeah, and it makes your life and your cannabis if you're yeah
[30:45.570 --> 30:49.690]  If you're not doing that your dick if you're gonna grow cannabis and you're not
[30:50.130 --> 30:57.330]  Starting and just like sitting in that room 24 7 just like on your hands and knees cross-legged like Indian style like loving on them
[30:58.290 --> 31:05.070]  Then it that's you're not getting this part of the story. I'm gonna write it down. It's official grow from your heart podcast
[31:05.510 --> 31:10.310]  Grow from your heart I like it. We just gotta get people now spread the word
[31:10.950 --> 31:13.010]  That's what we're trying to do spread the word
[31:14.070 --> 31:16.750]  Well, most people are listening. Most of you guys are listening
[31:16.750 --> 31:21.630]  Well, you already know because you're listening. All right, these are one of those times that we were talking about where I say something dumb
[31:22.350 --> 31:25.970]  Um, I don't know that it's dumb. We're not even gonna critique what you said
[31:25.970 --> 31:27.970]  You can go on
[31:30.170 --> 31:31.690]  Nah
[31:31.690 --> 31:33.370]  Likes to get picked on in our hair
[31:33.370 --> 31:35.770]  What are my favorite things to do Adam likes to start a rant?
[31:36.050 --> 31:39.490]  He'll stare at you as he does it waiting for you to reply and we don't reply
[31:39.490 --> 31:41.250]  He just puts his foot deeper in his mouth
[31:41.250 --> 31:41.610]  Yeah
[31:41.610 --> 31:45.810]  Just like and then you look at him like uh-huh and it would be the perfect time right then to stop
[31:45.810 --> 31:49.330]  But he has three more things that he really wants to cram in there
[31:49.330 --> 31:54.090]  Jesus Christ what is wrong with this asshole?
[31:54.090 --> 31:58.770]  my favorite is when we're in the car and he just starts to do in it and he doesn't know if I'm silent because he's
[31:58.770 --> 32:03.930]  Being a dipshit or if I'm just driving or what it is and he's like and blah blah blah blah blah and I just nope
[32:03.930 --> 32:05.930]  No reply. I want to see what's next
[32:06.610 --> 32:09.930]  I just want to see what's gonna come after that. Can he top that shit?
[32:09.930 --> 32:13.850]  Yeah, he's does always he always manages to top his own foot in his mouth
[32:14.850 --> 32:20.450]  Yeah, that's that's why we keep you around bro, oh, I know I'm good for a laugh every now
[32:20.450 --> 32:26.290]  And then working with them either with me or at me one of the other and I either way it's fun working with them this
[32:26.290 --> 32:28.850]  Last week I've had some good laughs. Yeah, and thank you man
[32:28.850 --> 32:34.130]  Like for real you put food on the plate like it for the shout out this week you brother like straight up
[32:34.450 --> 32:42.370]  It's built a new a new play hut. Yeah. Yeah playing in the dirt all day screwing off. I can it's the Denver Bud company
[32:43.050 --> 32:45.050]  They're gonna be wholesalers and
[32:46.650 --> 32:50.730]  Thank you, you know going to their business plan is to be able to
[32:51.570 --> 32:57.490]  Buy their brand of cannabis in dispensaries all over the all over the state. So nice
[32:58.090 --> 33:01.930]  But yeah, they'll be opening sometime soon when we're done building it
[33:03.130 --> 33:06.850]  Now they got a few other hurdles after that. Oh, yeah inspections. Yeah
[33:07.370 --> 33:10.090]  The hardest part in Colorado right now is getting damn water
[33:10.930 --> 33:14.370]  Yeah, getting water rights for your girl is a big big big deal
[33:14.370 --> 33:19.730]  Yeah, we saw a huge freaking grow today and out of south of Pueblo
[33:19.730 --> 33:23.890]  They're all around us right now. If you go out Highway 96 towards wet more
[33:25.370 --> 33:30.370]  It's just right up against the highway their chain-link fence. You can almost like flicker your fingers in it when you drive
[33:30.850 --> 33:32.850]  It's right up against the highway. Yeah
[33:32.850 --> 33:39.190]  Oh, yeah, I know which one that is and then the one you guys saw down south that that thing that place has a freaking
[33:39.190 --> 33:40.310]  Eric air strip on it
[33:40.310 --> 33:45.670]  I gotta say one of the neatest I have seen is my boy Hanky be over at the greener side dispensary on
[33:46.330 --> 33:51.290]  State you haven't seen they've got a bunch of LED lights going there. It's not happening right now
[33:51.290 --> 33:56.130]  But last season towards the end of the season they had Ellie LED lights and it made that hole
[33:56.410 --> 34:00.330]  What is it like a 60 by a hundred foot greenhouse 60, but there are no
[34:00.930 --> 34:03.690]  Shit 120s the length. Okay. I can't remember the
[34:04.210 --> 34:08.370]  Huge it's bigger than your house. Oh, yeah, and it was filled with LED lights
[34:08.370 --> 34:12.850]  And so when the Sun set right at sunset, it looked like aliens were invading for about a mile
[34:12.850 --> 34:16.530]  It's just a big purple. They shit ball. Yeah, it was so awesome. Yeah
[34:17.170 --> 34:21.530]  It's a neat greenhouse. That was one of one of the best stuff. Was that forever flowering?
[34:21.530 --> 34:22.050]  Yes, sir
[34:22.050 --> 34:24.050]  Shout out to forever flowering northern
[34:24.330 --> 34:29.690]  Altitude or hemisphere or something like that is the model with all the bells and whistles all of them
[34:29.690 --> 34:32.130]  Yeah, yeah that thing sings to you in the morning
[34:32.770 --> 34:38.410]  All right. Um, I do have a couple of news articles. We're 35 minutes in a great crazy rambling guys
[34:38.410 --> 34:43.250]  I hope you like these episodes where we just come and hang out a little bit the past couple of episodes have been really intense
[34:43.730 --> 34:47.170]  My friend hippie nurse. I haven't talked to you in quite a while. I hope you're still listening to the show
[34:47.170 --> 34:50.550]  I hope you're well, we haven't talked just been busy I guess

[35:12.330 --> 35:16.090]  I hope that didn't happen in the recording you guys cuz we all I hope it didn't either
[35:18.970 --> 35:23.810]  My brain exploded in my head and electricity happened that's basically I think what happened
[35:24.170 --> 35:30.010]  Think we'd all just got hit by lightning through the headphones. Holy shit. So I have a news article to yeah
[35:30.890 --> 35:37.010]  First time ever reading a news article so do it bear with me. I'm not reading it either, but I'll just hit the points
[35:37.670 --> 35:39.670]  so basically the
[35:40.370 --> 35:47.490]  good old Congress which I believe acts as City Council kind of sort of of Washington DC is
[35:50.130 --> 35:52.490]  One of the congressmen is thrown in a
[35:54.810 --> 35:59.370]  Um shit, I'm just trying to gather up some information here anyways
[35:59.770 --> 36:03.730]  I've got it on my screen if you want me to read it for you. Yeah, let me take this one tab news articles
[36:03.730 --> 36:06.410]  Yeah, we actually did you find it on the cannabis?
[36:07.130 --> 36:11.770]  Huff post is where I got it. I saw it on the cannabis this morning. I'm gonna take this quick dab
[36:11.770 --> 36:17.250]  I got some live resin from the Garden of Weedon. This is uh, let me read you the proper serious fucking bullshit
[36:17.570 --> 36:19.970]  Gorilla hate not the dab. The dab is not bullshit. Yeah
[36:20.770 --> 36:27.170]  This dab is fucking for real the the dab is some serious fucking fire. This is gorilla. Haze. It's moonshine. Haze
[36:27.770 --> 36:32.750]  Gorilla glue number four. Yes, and they were blasted together in the obidos
[36:33.850 --> 36:38.130]  Obidos obidos shout out to emo tech dude emo tech sent me a brand new email
[36:38.130 --> 36:41.330]  I've had it running basically for a week straight without turning it off
[36:41.330 --> 36:43.730]  I turned it off when I go to bed and shit, but honestly I
[36:44.170 --> 36:49.090]  Walk up. It's like my coffee pot when you wake up. I walk up and turn it on you spend a lot of time sitting
[36:49.970 --> 36:52.430]  It's on a lot of feature for the you know
[36:53.170 --> 36:58.890]  Coffee pot timer time that don't do I actually put my old email on a timer because I used to fall asleep with it on
[36:58.890 --> 37:01.050]  So I put her on a timer to shut off about 3 in the morning
[37:01.050 --> 37:07.650]  This one's got a fucking USB port that I charge my phone on and it charges my iPhone so fast
[37:07.850 --> 37:10.410]  We I bet it does especially the higher temperature
[37:10.410 --> 37:12.810]  You raise it up to probably connected to that like
[37:15.090 --> 37:20.450]  I'm gonna take this nap. Yeah, it smells great. What up Spence?
[37:22.370 --> 37:24.370]  Somebody tell me I've yet about
[37:24.770 --> 37:29.450]  But I'm sure I will here Spencer check out a garden of weed
[37:30.330 --> 37:37.250]  He just killed or actually Maddie did but they both did they just killed some government meal of mine
[37:37.730 --> 37:39.730]  Man
[37:42.330 --> 37:45.610]  Quite possibly one of the best rounds I've ever seen of it
[37:45.610 --> 37:51.650]  I haven't got to grow that strain inside as much as I would have liked to the stuff. They post is just
[37:54.810 --> 37:57.130]  I mean, what's the cross on your government meal?
[37:57.690 --> 37:59.450]  It is
[37:59.450 --> 38:01.130]  g13
[38:01.130 --> 38:03.650]  crossed with Tom Hills deep junk
[38:04.250 --> 38:06.250]  That sounds delicious Hill is a
[38:06.890 --> 38:08.410]  Everything he makes is amazing
[38:08.410 --> 38:11.170]  So we've got a little collaboration happening
[38:11.170 --> 38:14.690]  Jesse is actually gonna breathe and I'm gonna put the seeds in I read genetics packages
[38:14.770 --> 38:17.610]  And we're gonna sell them as I read genetics products because I need some help
[38:18.530 --> 38:25.050]  Will that rats on that? Well that the government you'll be involved in that project. Yeah, that times a OG mail. Oh
[38:25.970 --> 38:27.530]  I
[38:27.530 --> 38:29.530]  Literally don't have a name for it
[38:29.930 --> 38:34.050]  And you know, I'm not gonna try to make up some crazy name to
[38:34.890 --> 38:39.330]  For this mail I can just say it's it's a really good mail. It's been proven
[38:40.170 --> 38:45.170]  It's made several crosses for some small-time breeders. Is it the OG mail I think of?
[38:46.090 --> 38:49.210]  Yeah, yeah the one we were talking about the other night. Yeah, cool
[38:50.170 --> 38:55.290]  So unfortunately, you know, there's not gonna be anything fancy on the package in regards to you know
[38:55.290 --> 39:00.170]  It's just mystery mail or something like that, but the government meals serious fire
[39:01.250 --> 39:07.210]  The two cross together. It's just it's gonna be a any the government meals real deep chunk leaning
[39:07.210 --> 39:12.810]  We've got to give your mail a name like gauge calls his mail Joseph. Yeah, so we just got to name it
[39:12.810 --> 39:14.810]  It just needs a cool name
[39:14.810 --> 39:16.210]  Henry
[39:16.210 --> 39:18.210]  It could be Henry could be the Henry. Oh, dude
[39:18.210 --> 39:22.170]  I could be what it is that was the name of the meal that I grew up next to it was Henry the meal
[39:22.170 --> 39:24.170]  You'd hear him every morning
[39:24.170 --> 39:27.630]  That shit might have just accidentally happened Tonya there it is
[39:28.170 --> 39:34.090]  So I'm gonna read this news article, but first I want to remind myself. Oh, that's fucking dangerous. You can do that. That's cool
[39:47.130 --> 39:51.650]  Yeah, you're quick I just hit 10,000 Instagram I was gonna write that down
[39:55.130 --> 40:01.130]  10,000 Instagram followers. Thank you guys all 10,000 of you or at least the hundred and fifty of you that like my pictures
[40:01.130 --> 40:03.130]  What the fuck is that?
[40:03.290 --> 40:08.890]  Can I get a goddamn like well, you gotta think though, you know people just don't get on it
[40:08.890 --> 40:14.210]  No all that often and actually Instagram is going through and cleaning up spam accounts and taking off all kinds of shit
[40:14.210 --> 40:16.210]  So good. I got one form
[40:16.210 --> 40:18.210]  By
[40:20.530 --> 40:26.890]  The way guys that's over grown your gov just because somebody I forgot somebody had taken that that's the only
[40:29.610 --> 40:33.650]  Twitter who has got like 60 followers and hasn't posted in two years
[40:34.250 --> 40:39.170]  Like I would think if you went there and it has nothing to do with cannabis and then nothing to do with
[40:39.450 --> 40:44.090]  Anything slowly say you properly say your Instagram order grow
[40:44.770 --> 40:49.530]  Grown your gov overgrown your gov or grown you might even following you
[40:50.050 --> 40:54.910]  Yes, you found me. I mean usually people find me it's it's it's definitely happened
[40:54.910 --> 40:56.910]  But can we say your real name on the show your full name?
[40:57.210 --> 41:01.730]  Adam Gaskins. Yeah, I call him gas cans when I call him. I told my I tell Siri call Adam gas cans
[41:01.730 --> 41:05.450]  Yeah, that's that that's what I heard when I was a kid. So, you know, it's fun
[41:05.450 --> 41:09.730]  Put your phone your Siri on a British accent with a chick. Yeah, and it's hot dude. Yeah
[41:10.610 --> 41:13.110]  Call Adam gas she's all ringing
[41:16.370 --> 41:22.010]  You're kind of weird with that I stuff I like my I devices I like them right Apple cool
[41:22.890 --> 41:26.250]  So yeah, let's read this article to Jesse kind of started to read it says
[41:26.850 --> 41:30.670]  Obama opposes congressional effort to stop DC pot legalization
[41:30.670 --> 41:37.090]  Oh, you mentioned that and the picture it looks like he's clapping, but he's not he's got this like weird facial expression
[41:37.570 --> 41:44.290]  This article is from it just says Associated Press. Nobody gets any credit here the AP. That's all so whoever wrote it. Sorry, bro
[41:44.290 --> 41:46.290]  You know what he cared
[41:47.050 --> 41:52.170]  It says president president Barack Obama plans to sign a 1.1
[41:52.730 --> 41:56.250]  Trillion dollar government spending bill if it reaches his desk
[41:56.250 --> 42:02.410]  Although he opposed a provision blocking the District of Columbia from legalizing marijuana. Jesse's frantically searching his phone
[42:02.410 --> 42:04.410]  I may be reading a different article
[42:04.410 --> 42:08.130]  I just want to get that asshole Congress congressman's name. So
[42:09.370 --> 42:14.210]  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that despite reservations Obama is set to sign
[42:14.890 --> 42:20.090]  Legislation to fund nearly the entire government through the end of the budget year September 30th
[42:20.970 --> 42:28.330]  District voters approved an initiative November 4th to allow possession of up to two ounces of pot or up to three mature plants for personal use
[42:28.970 --> 42:35.690]  But here we go language inserted by Republicans in the spending bill would bar the city from moving forward with legalization
[42:36.090 --> 42:41.610]  Earnest says the president believes Congress shouldn't interfere with the will of city voters on marijuana and other issues
[42:42.010 --> 42:45.290]  Obama supports statehood for the district so
[42:45.890 --> 42:52.890]  They wrote a new budget proposal by they looks like the Republicans have submitted this right but in the wording
[42:53.330 --> 42:54.970]  they also
[42:54.970 --> 42:59.650]  Try to block the legalization of cannabis in the District of Columbia
[43:00.050 --> 43:03.130]  So just in the city not in the state, correct?
[43:04.330 --> 43:09.210]  Like you know, it's a district but you know what I'm saying? It's like it's the whole state from what I read
[43:09.210 --> 43:14.450]  It's gonna be the whole state Washington DC. I didn't I was speaking as I read it
[43:14.450 --> 43:16.890]  So I may not blind provision a lot district of Columbia
[43:16.890 --> 43:23.730]  Yeah, it's gonna be the only see like the whole the area around the White House and that you know, like the presidential land
[43:25.050 --> 43:30.690]  District. Yeah, so here's what sucks is Obama would so it'll be legal Obama's down with DC being
[43:31.250 --> 43:36.290]  Legalized he says he's cool. He didn't write out his spokesperson says they have to pass the budget
[43:36.290 --> 43:41.290]  They have to pass that budget. I couldn't find that cocksuckers name. Can't he go out? Can he just he's a president, bro?
[43:41.290 --> 43:43.290]  Can't why doesn't he just fucking erase that line?
[43:43.650 --> 43:46.890]  Wipe that shit out something to do with some kind of bullshit. Yeah
[43:46.890 --> 43:50.550]  I'm sure I'd be the first one to say it like go ahead and say I see that he
[43:50.970 --> 43:54.130]  decriminalizes it at least before he gets out, you know because he was so
[43:55.130 --> 43:57.130]  I'll leave it alone. I'll leave it alone
[43:57.130 --> 44:03.530]  and then the raids and stuff like he was here and he's still like there's a war on drugs still and this then the other and
[44:05.690 --> 44:10.210]  You know, it's it's one of those things that I feel like if he's gonna do anything that
[44:11.810 --> 44:17.810]  Gives him a like on the way out. It'll be something along that line if he can just bring it down to a new
[44:18.410 --> 44:20.410]  substance law, you know
[44:20.410 --> 44:22.410]  I don't know
[44:22.410 --> 44:25.950]  Yeah, it just sucks because he's got to do something before he's gonna tell her this
[44:26.650 --> 44:28.650]  he's gonna pass and
[44:28.650 --> 44:30.410]  spokesperson says
[44:30.410 --> 44:35.570]  He believes Congress shouldn't interfere with the will of city voters on marijuana and other issues and he supports statehood
[44:36.810 --> 44:38.810]  What it does is it blocks any?
[44:39.450 --> 44:46.210]  Any congressional or city money being used to implement the program? So it's like a shitty ultimatum
[44:46.210 --> 44:51.530]  Yeah, it's just like we don't need your money. They'll gladly give it to you by the droves
[44:51.530 --> 44:58.050]  Have you not what happened paying attention? What happened to voting and then what the voters vote for happening?
[44:58.050 --> 44:59.650]  No, no, like what happened to that?
[44:59.650 --> 45:05.410]  It's like your parents telling you go to a house party on Saturday when they damn well know you'll be in, Texas. I
[45:07.490 --> 45:09.490]  Like that
[45:10.090 --> 45:12.610]  There's nothing I can do about it. It's in the president's hands now
[45:12.610 --> 45:16.210]  I hope you guys in DC get to smoke your recreational legal cannabis, right?
[45:16.610 --> 45:20.550]  Tell them so they won't have a store, but they can still you know, I mean
[45:21.290 --> 45:23.290]  Fight the good fight guys, you know
[45:23.890 --> 45:26.890]  What they're doing is it sounds like they're encouraging the gray market
[45:27.490 --> 45:30.930]  You know, it's exactly what I thought when I read the article
[45:30.930 --> 45:35.410]  I mean, it sounds like a good place to be a caregiver in Colorado. That gray market is getting squeezed out
[45:35.410 --> 45:38.770]  I know pots super illegal or expensive. What's not super illegal?
[45:38.770 --> 45:40.530]  It's super fucking expensive at the dispensaries
[45:40.530 --> 45:43.970]  But it seems like from hanging out in the shop as much as I have been lately
[45:43.970 --> 45:49.090]  There are a lot of people that would rather just go that go to the dispensary shop from the jars
[45:49.210 --> 45:54.730]  There are like 12 strains on the shot on the shelf at the shop. You don't get choice honestly in my opinion
[45:54.730 --> 45:57.250]  It's too expensive, but that's cuz I'm a spoiled bitch. I
[45:58.050 --> 46:00.930]  Grow my own herb. I know what it costs. I've been paying
[46:01.490 --> 46:04.610]  really low prices for several years now and to go there and it's
[46:05.170 --> 46:10.810]  Double a little more than double what I'm used to paying but it's legal but and it's you don't have to wait for anybody
[46:10.810 --> 46:14.670]  You have to sit in a cushy comfy chair and listen to decent reggae music
[46:14.670 --> 46:16.770]  They play good reggae there too. That has nothing to do with me
[46:17.210 --> 46:20.650]  You sit in these cozy little chairs and chill out and it's a chill environment
[46:20.730 --> 46:25.170]  and if you don't want to wait for your dude to show up if you just want to grab an eighth on the way home
[46:25.170 --> 46:28.730]  From work if you don't want it because deals are sketchy in a parking lot and shit
[46:28.730 --> 46:30.730]  You don't want to be doing that anymore. Just go to that
[46:30.730 --> 46:36.770]  It's I could see the black and I'm a markets just being I'm telling you they would be they would be totally wiped out
[46:36.770 --> 46:40.770]  I feel if it was accessible in every street corner, you know
[46:40.770 --> 46:45.770]  almost like a damn liquor store where there's you know, 13 of them in town spread out instead of
[46:46.250 --> 46:49.570]  You know 14 of them out there in a mile area
[46:49.570 --> 46:53.850]  And I mean that's just hard you guys in states that are just about to legalize her that are pushing it
[46:53.850 --> 46:56.170]  You got to get on top of shit the day it pops
[46:56.170 --> 46:58.170]  You got to get your shop open
[46:58.330 --> 47:02.550]  Because you have to start making enough money to comply with the regulations
[47:02.550 --> 47:07.530]  They're coming because now that Colorado has set the standard other places are just kind of adopting that
[47:08.110 --> 47:13.130]  They're just saying Colorado's doing this. They kind of set it around that. They're not making the same mistakes as well
[47:13.130 --> 47:14.250]  They already have a template
[47:14.250 --> 47:17.970]  You're not getting what we used to call here was the wild wild west that I talked about
[47:18.050 --> 47:22.410]  Jesse knows the wild wild west real well good old days grow the quarter pounds and the houses
[47:22.690 --> 47:28.170]  Rent other houses grow weed in there take that weed to shops and sell it to the shop straight up for cash
[47:28.170 --> 47:33.050]  I'd walk in with the backpack full of pounds if I had a variety if I had five or six quarter pounds I could sell
[47:33.050 --> 47:38.750]  All of those quarter pounds for like seven hundred seven fifty a quarter pound dude and walk out with cash back in the day
[47:38.750 --> 47:42.650]  there was a handful of shops here in town and in the area that
[47:44.810 --> 47:47.050]  Really I guess only one of them survived but
[47:48.690 --> 47:50.410]  Well, too
[47:50.410 --> 47:52.170]  but
[47:52.850 --> 47:55.450]  You know, that's they didn't have girl rooms
[47:56.730 --> 48:01.330]  They got stuff from guys like me and Jeff. Yeah, it was totally legal at the time
[48:01.330 --> 48:03.330]  I had a job that was all you know
[48:03.530 --> 48:09.290]  Medical and it isn't that what people just went out and got their red cards and they you know, that's that's what they did
[48:09.290 --> 48:15.410]  Yeah, but in that kind of squeezed the gray market here. Did it not like in town just because it was accessible
[48:15.930 --> 48:21.210]  When inside city limit we made our dispensary public. We had a dispensary that we kept slightly private
[48:21.210 --> 48:25.050]  We didn't let a lot of people know about it was in a little kind of thing and private clubs or nothing
[48:25.050 --> 48:30.810]  No, but eventually we decided let's take this to the bigger big room in our retail store and just kind of show that this
[48:30.810 --> 48:32.090]  Is what we're doing?
[48:32.090 --> 48:34.490]  We drop prices in this town dramatically
[48:35.250 --> 48:39.130]  It was 400 bucks an ounce for any kind of kind bud for a while around here
[48:39.850 --> 48:47.170]  About 10 years ago 10 or 12 years ago 400 bucks an ounce. That's our diesel that we smoke 400 bucks an ounce dude for 28 grams
[48:47.170 --> 48:48.490]  No love
[48:48.490 --> 48:52.170]  You'd sell it for 60 bucks an eighth and they'd be 3.4. You know what I mean?
[48:52.170 --> 48:52.850]  Yeah
[48:52.850 --> 48:54.570]  No love on that bag at all
[48:54.570 --> 49:01.010]  And then we got the shop going and when we first did it ounces were 350 just to keep us in business because we were
[49:01.010 --> 49:01.770]  Selling out, you know
[49:01.770 --> 49:08.250]  and then we had we had a big outdoor harvest and we dropped down ounces down to 320 and then our patients were paying 280 and
[49:08.290 --> 49:09.570]  then
[49:09.570 --> 49:12.810]  We were seeing better quality because a lot of our stuff was outdoor
[49:12.810 --> 49:18.210]  We're growing a large outdoor and we saw the competitors the two shops that are still around. They were getting good indoor
[49:18.610 --> 49:22.650]  And stuff I couldn't grow enough to keep it on our shelves. We had a downtown location. We're banging
[49:22.650 --> 49:27.970]  Yeah, so we dropped prices to 200 bucks an ounce at one point and that fucked up the whole town
[49:27.970 --> 49:31.330]  I was getting hate mail hate calls death threats
[49:31.330 --> 49:36.290]  Like people were mad at me because I was the one I was the face of that shop. They thought it was all me
[49:37.050 --> 49:39.850]  Kind of was but yeah, we pissed off the town and drop prices now
[49:39.850 --> 49:44.970]  Hey, now you can go score a good ounce in this town for 200 bucks and people still want to find cheaper ounces
[49:44.970 --> 49:48.190]  They're out there. But for the good dank, it's about dispensary prices usually
[49:48.770 --> 49:54.770]  You know depending on where you go. It's about 450 and ounce right now at the spot. I think for a good day counts
[49:55.650 --> 49:59.450]  They got some good Durban poison though. I would if I had to smoke one, that's what I'd go for
[50:01.090 --> 50:04.450]  One more news article I mentioned the part about Seth Rogen we may get to that
[50:04.450 --> 50:07.990]  We may not you guys Seth Rogen wanted to come to Denver and do a smokeout for his new movie
[50:08.010 --> 50:12.090]  They wouldn't let him smoke. That's kind of the quick version. You can't smoke in a public place anymore
[50:12.090 --> 50:14.890]  He had to serve tequila shitty. Alright, so this one is cool
[50:15.530 --> 50:17.530]  Department of Justice ruling
[50:18.210 --> 50:21.210]  Yeah, sorry, go ahead. We'll get we'll get we'll try to read that one
[50:21.210 --> 50:24.890]  We will since you just said that Indian tribes can legalize pot on their lands
[50:25.250 --> 50:29.250]  Then the sub headline if tribes can balance all the potential social issues
[50:29.330 --> 50:35.690]  It could be a really huge opportunity says Seattle attorney Anthony Broadman whose firm represents tribal governments throughout the West
[50:36.090 --> 50:42.610]  So this article was published on December 11th, it's written by Jeff Bernard and go see oh was Nakia from the Associated Press
[50:43.610 --> 50:50.410]  It says the US Department of Justice said Thursday that American Indian tribes can grow and sell marijuana on their lands as long as they follow
[50:50.410 --> 50:53.770]  The same federal conditions laid out for states that have legalized the drug
[50:54.330 --> 51:01.670]  Oregon US Attorney Amanda Marshall said Thursday the announcement addresses questions raised by tribes about how legalization of pot in states like Oregon
[51:01.690 --> 51:04.250]  Washington and Colorado would apply to Indian lands
[51:05.250 --> 51:11.290]  Only three tribes have expressed interest in growing and selling marijuana said Marshall who co-chaired a group that developed the policy
[51:11.370 --> 51:16.550]  One is in California one in Washington and one state in the Midwest that she did not name
[51:17.130 --> 51:22.330]  That's been the primary message tribes are getting to us as US attorneys Marshall said from Portland
[51:22.490 --> 51:28.970]  What will the US as federal partners do to assist tribes in protecting our children and families our tribal businesses our tribal housing?
[51:28.970 --> 51:36.170]  How will you help us combat marijuana abuse in Indian Country or Indian County when states are no longer there to partner with us?
[51:37.610 --> 51:39.770]  Marijuana abuse do you guys see a lot of that?
[51:41.810 --> 51:43.810]  Over here. Yeah a lot of
[51:44.850 --> 51:49.530]  Yeah, because you just like fucking all that that four grams the scissor hash. I don't need that
[51:50.050 --> 51:57.450]  Throw that in the trash. I that makes me laugh because I'm thinking about what comical does get abused on Indian reservations
[51:57.970 --> 52:03.570]  Well, I was gonna ask you how do you feel about that too, you know since they're allowed to do everything that they're you know
[52:03.650 --> 52:06.490]  Now they're they're making money in collecting
[52:07.250 --> 52:10.210]  Tax for the state but that all that land is tax-free
[52:10.690 --> 52:16.250]  Like I don't I'm with that, you know, like we've fucking stolen the whole West from them, but
[52:17.410 --> 52:19.410]  like
[52:19.450 --> 52:24.610]  If you're gonna make money it but if you're gonna sell it to the public as like Indian grown herb
[52:25.410 --> 52:30.370]  You should at least pay tax on the land that's it's doing that, you know, I'm saying like it for your plot
[52:30.370 --> 52:34.130]  I don't really approaches that I'm sure the state would still require
[52:34.130 --> 52:38.490]  They're definitely gonna take taxes for the herb, but not for the for the land. You can't retax
[52:38.490 --> 52:41.610]  Oh, that's the whole problem with having an Indian business on
[52:42.170 --> 52:45.410]  Land though is that's that's the fight. They've been fighting for many years is
[52:46.050 --> 52:49.010]  They won't let them have any kind of businesses on there. That's gonna
[52:49.010 --> 52:53.890]  Prove profitable, you know when they open a casino or something like that. It's not on Indian land. It's on
[52:54.810 --> 52:59.530]  You know some outskirt land that they've had to buy like separately and pay land tax on
[52:59.930 --> 53:05.170]  That's that's been one of the large arguments that I've I've at least seen over the past couple years
[53:05.170 --> 53:09.610]  I don't know enough about that to argue you. All right, so you want all right? No, I was asking you good job
[53:10.530 --> 53:16.010]  I'm giving you credit the southern boy just made a point. Maybe 44 44
[53:16.170 --> 53:18.970]  44 44 getting it done
[53:20.330 --> 53:26.010]  Episode 44 hot because it sounds like we're razzing each other. We just are cuz we're bros. Sorry. Don't get mad at us
[53:26.010 --> 53:28.270]  No, I'm gonna give him a fucking wedgie in a minute
[53:28.270 --> 53:32.890]  Whoa, so hard that you can read Haynes on his forehead. You ever had that kind just pull it up right over your forehead
[53:33.170 --> 53:35.170]  Took a shoe in the back
[53:37.330 --> 53:43.530]  Could be really weird for you ladies and gentlemen, this is the episode with too much information. Yeah. All right
[53:43.530 --> 53:46.250]  I'm gonna try to read this article with the throw-up. That's in my mouth
[53:47.410 --> 53:48.730]  Marshall warned
[53:48.730 --> 53:55.810]  The warned the announcement is not a green light to tribal authorities and that marijuana is still illegal under federal law the US government's prosecution
[53:56.250 --> 54:01.090]  Priorities involve pot related gang activity violence sales to kids and trafficking will continue
[54:01.090 --> 54:07.850]  She said problems could arise for tribes with lands in states that still outlaw marijuana due to the likelihood that marijuana could be
[54:07.970 --> 54:10.250]  transported or sold outside tribal boundaries
[54:10.250 --> 54:17.730]  She added Seattle attorney Anthony Broadman whose firm represents tribal governments throughout the West said the announcement represents a potential for enormous
[54:17.970 --> 54:20.050]  economic developable development tool here
[54:21.010 --> 54:26.770]  Yeah, if tribes can balance all the potential social issues. It could be a really huge opportunity gonna have to pay
[54:26.770 --> 54:28.210]  I think they'll be able to handle it
[54:28.210 --> 54:31.650]  There's a I want to read this one next paragraph and then I can rant on the part
[54:31.650 --> 54:37.130]  That's the elephant in the room, but those social issues are monumental Indian tribes have been decimated by drug abuse
[54:37.290 --> 54:45.010]  Broadman said tribal regulations of pot are going to have to dovetail with tribal values making sure marijuana isn't a scourge like alcohol
[54:45.010 --> 54:46.650]  or tobacco
[54:46.650 --> 54:48.010]  All right
[54:48.010 --> 54:53.370]  I'm gonna sound racist. Maybe generalization. We all know that natives have trouble with alcohol
[54:53.810 --> 54:57.410]  Not all of them, but the ones that do really fucking do
[54:58.810 --> 55:03.710]  Alcohol is a horrible thing that ruins tons of lives not just Native Americans
[55:04.150 --> 55:10.470]  The problem is that you concentrate them in one area and then you look at them from afar and then you notice
[55:11.270 --> 55:14.830]  similarities and stereotypes just as in any race or
[55:16.030 --> 55:20.310]  Okay
[55:20.310 --> 55:23.730]  How is herb gonna be a big problem on a I'm frustrated. I'm
[55:26.070 --> 55:28.070]  We've seen that it works
[55:29.590 --> 55:35.430]  Washington hasn't blown up yet. Let's try to replace the alcohol abuse on the reservation with some cannabis enjoyment
[55:35.910 --> 55:39.710]  Maybe the problems that are associated with alcohol abuse. I've got a whole list of
[55:40.470 --> 55:45.710]  Podcast planned we could talk about for I got five. Do not look at Alaska almost in that same way. I mean
[55:51.670 --> 55:53.670]  Like Alaska, Utah, Arizona
[55:54.990 --> 55:56.990]  New Mexico, Oklahoma
[55:57.030 --> 56:00.590]  Colorado all those tribes like I mean really really bad problems
[56:00.870 --> 56:06.350]  Or I mean not sound like a dick but I mean I've been around a reservation or two so
[56:07.830 --> 56:11.550]  But yeah, no, I just I think it'd be an awesome development thing for
[56:12.750 --> 56:17.110]  Economical development for sure and they're fucking right getting back to the land. I mean, yeah
[56:17.110 --> 56:17.710]  Yeah, all right
[56:17.710 --> 56:20.510]  So let's read about these taxes part the tax bar here says tribe selling
[56:20.830 --> 56:27.190]  Marijuana may not be subject to state and local taxes allowing them to undercut off reservation sales. Also, maybe not
[56:27.590 --> 56:29.590]  In
[56:30.310 --> 56:36.150]  Washington taxes at 25% of the price of pot also in Colorado, but Allison Holcomb Holcomb
[56:36.150 --> 56:36.390]  Yeah
[56:36.390 --> 56:43.190]  I said that right a primary drafter of Washington state's legalization measure said most people in larger states won't want to drive to far-flung
[56:43.390 --> 56:46.950]  Reservations to buy pot you're crazy dude. Imagine that Indian dank weed
[56:47.070 --> 56:53.110]  What was the was it here on the podcast that we had the statistic where we got 30 million dollars just in recreational sales
[56:53.830 --> 56:59.110]  Year that came from out of state or 70% of that came from out of state and then every time I go in and talk
[56:59.110 --> 57:01.110]  To the security guard at any dispensary
[57:01.630 --> 57:05.790]  Texas fucking Texas. I guarantee you 50% of that was, Texas
[57:06.270 --> 57:11.670]  I'm gonna go kind of fast because we're approaching an hour the yukama nation. I said that wrong Yakima nation
[57:11.670 --> 57:16.950]  Sorry, I apologize in Washington State recently passed a ban on marijuana on the reservation and is trying to halt state-regulated
[57:17.230 --> 57:21.990]  Pot sales and grows on lands off the reservation where it still holds hunting and fishing rights
[57:22.470 --> 57:25.390]  So they don't want you growing where they can hunt and fish with I can
[57:26.590 --> 57:28.910]  Actually a conflict with that or if it's just
[57:29.630 --> 57:34.310]  Politics just politics. You don't want to find our botanic air bottles in their hunting grounds. Well, yeah
[57:34.310 --> 57:38.230]  No, no, I just I wonder if there's actually anyone that wants to grow in their hunting grounds
[57:38.230 --> 57:46.070]  It actually says the hoop of Valley tribe in Northern California has battled illegal pot plantations on its reservation where they cause environmental damage
[57:46.150 --> 57:48.670]  But you know, that's illegal at any rate. There are
[57:49.430 --> 57:53.750]  566 tribes around the country recognized. I'm gonna go fast and scam recognized by federal government
[57:53.950 --> 57:55.670]  There's gonna be a lot of consulting happening
[57:55.670 --> 58:01.830]  Yes for sure limited resources in a vast amount of territory to cover federal prosecutors will not prosecute minor cases. Yay
[58:02.670 --> 58:10.310]  Tribal policy is based on the so-called coal memo named after the deputy attorney general who wrote it in which Justice Department said the federal
[58:10.310 --> 58:12.070]  government wouldn't intervene as long as
[58:12.070 --> 58:18.830]  Specialization states tightly regulate the drug and take steps to keep it from children criminal cartels and federal property in all the memo
[58:19.190 --> 58:23.190]  Said US attorneys reserve the right to prosecute for eight issues sales to kids
[58:23.830 --> 58:30.590]  Marijuana proceeds going to criminal enterprises shipping marijuana to other states where it is illegal guys quit doing that shit
[58:31.310 --> 58:36.070]  Illegal sales news about that firearms and violence drug driving and other health issues
[58:36.350 --> 58:41.190]  growing marijuana on public lands and possession of marijuana on federal property, so
[58:41.910 --> 58:46.870]  Hopefully eventually they're gonna let the Indians the natives you guys the natives will be able to grow on
[58:47.270 --> 58:53.950]  Their land and maybe have their own Indian dispensary. I think they grow some dank, bro. That's what they do. They're an agricultural
[58:55.350 --> 58:58.670]  Yeah, they're agricultural people they would make the dank
[58:58.670 --> 59:02.510]  I'm sure there would maybe ones that would abuse it just like anywhere else
[59:02.510 --> 59:05.670]  But for the most part I bet they would be real respectful about it
[59:05.670 --> 59:09.990]  you know I'm saying I mean that's if you have they not have they not like use that as
[59:10.950 --> 59:13.950]  Ceremonial or I mean I I don't know what they use
[59:13.950 --> 59:18.950]  I'm sure if you gave it to him it'd be the perfect thing. That's what the Ross does use for meditation for a reason yeah
[59:19.670 --> 59:25.630]  I don't think that it was around, but you know to be a more modern. It was wild in Iowa
[59:25.630 --> 59:30.310]  You know like you want to get technical the three of us abuse cannabis
[59:30.950 --> 59:36.130]  Yeah, like if we say we're medical patients that's a dab. We just took was way beyond medicine now
[59:37.110 --> 59:39.110]  first
[59:39.990 --> 59:41.990]  Stress
[59:41.990 --> 59:45.910]  We are look at the problems. We're causing we're loudmouths with microphones
[59:45.910 --> 59:50.310]  I mean like I had to take a nap on the couch the other night because I took too many dabs like
[59:50.630 --> 59:53.870]  If it had been whiskey or something like that you know
[59:54.830 --> 59:58.670]  Yeah, I mean yeah, you'd have thrown up. We'd have fucking trash everywhere
[01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:04.750]  Yeah, all right, so I'm gonna quickly. Yeah, we're gonna go over an hour guys. I hope you can stick with us
[01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:08.630]  Thanks for hanging in for the random chatter episode which is my what might be what I name it
[01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:11.290]  So Seth Rogan, I've got two articles here
[01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:15.270]  There was an article posted on December 8th, and then there's a follow-up article posted
[01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:21.710]  Let me click it to read the next date this one came out December 9th, so the night of the 8th must have been the event
[01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:26.070]  Seth Rogan says he will this is from Ricardo Baca Baca at the cannabis
[01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:32.150]  Seth Rogan says he will screen his new film Monday night in a Denver movie theater filled with marijuana smoke and hundreds of his fans
[01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:37.550]  But will movie theater hotbox actually happen while Rogan has said he thinks it should happen the city of Denver's
[01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:42.950]  Executive director of marijuana policy thinks the screening should obey Colorado law sans the marijuana smoke
[01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:46.950]  So he planned on
[01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:53.310]  Debuting his new movie at the Oriental Theatre, and he tweeted about it actually he said we're gonna all get stoned in the theater
[01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:58.190]  And that was kind of a bad idea because that can't really happen because of the rules here in Colorado
[01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:00.110]  They are super strict about that kind of shit
[01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:03.910]  So first Rogan started tweeting about getting high inside the Colorado theater with his fans
[01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:05.870]  Then the host venue
[01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:11.510]  The Psy Film Center on East Colfax Avenue contacted Sony to tell them the audience couldn't light up inside their spaces
[01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:16.110]  It would be against Colorado law then Sony told the film center the evening was no longer happening
[01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:22.110]  The cannabis cannabis reported that Rogan responded via Twitter that a Colorado screening would still happen only at a different theater
[01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:25.470]  The old video is acting lame, so we got a new one Rogan tweeted
[01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:29.590]  So where will Rogan land tonight and remember this is from a few nights ago
[01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:36.150]  The Oriental Theatre owner Scott Labrera who dude we've had some rage and dab parties in the Oriental Theatre
[01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:39.310]  That's where the first dabs of Denver event was it's where the secret cup used to be held
[01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:45.550]  There's a video on the I read genetics YouTube channel of me taking a fat dab inside
[01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.550]  So the first dab in there as far as I know
[01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:50.070]  Started that party up with a big old dab
[01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:57.110]  So then he says tonight's video is private and closed to the general public and two promoters who regularly booked the North Denver room
[01:01:57.790 --> 01:02:03.830]  For a pot friendly comedy shows confirmed that Rogan screening is scheduled to happen there on Monday night
[01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:10.910]  So it's at the Oriental Theatre owner of Denver pot shop Denver relief and comedy production group sexbot comedy told the cannabis
[01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:14.030]  We don't know if there will be any sort of consumption or anything
[01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:16.470]  I'm gonna skip a couple of things
[01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:20.750]  We're gonna scroll through so he was planning to come and watch this new movie
[01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:24.510]  Which I still haven't read the name of they have not advertised the name of his movie in this article at all
[01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:28.990]  Isn't it the interview? I think so looks hilarious. I
[01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:32.630]  Don't watch TV, so I don't see the commercial story
[01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:36.750]  So there's no provision in amendment 64 for the on-premise consumption of marijuana
[01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:41.750]  Kilroy said that could have been put in amendment 64, but it wasn't so the voters did not vote for it
[01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:47.110]  So Kilroy said the Denver Police Department and the city's Department of Excise and License have historically contacted
[01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:51.350]  businesses advertising pot friendly parties ahead of time to talk about potential violations
[01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:55.790]  We've educated people on what the law is said Kilroy and we've gotten compliance generally
[01:02:55.950 --> 01:03:00.550]  When asked if they were aware of Rogan's event and without even mentioning the Oriental as a possible location
[01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:06.870]  Kilroy's office told the cannabis that Denver police would reach out to the Oriental Theatres owners sometime Monday
[01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:12.350]  So that was the original article. He was gonna come he was gonna puff, right? So on the next
[01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.990]  publishing day the 9th
[01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:18.510]  Jack Brown from the cannabis said his article article highline
[01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:21.990]  No, we'd plenty of tequila at the interview in Denver with Seth Rogen
[01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:27.030]  So there was one thing everyone could smell Monday night at the Denver screening of the interview
[01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:32.970]  Tequila, so that sucks dude. They had to not puff and they had to serve tequila
[01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:39.950]  What would happen if we replaced every dab we've taken on the podcast and before the podcast with a shot of tequila?
[01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.190]  How do you think our night would have gone?
[01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:48.030]  Probably pissed myself by now and thrown up somewhere because that's what tequila makes me do I would have been really mad and violent, right?
[01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:49.430]  Yeah
[01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:52.750]  You honestly you think you give me shit about dabs, dude
[01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:57.650]  I'm even more of a pussy when it comes to liquor beer I can I can deal with but
[01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:01.870]  You don't have to be not being able to drink tequila does not mean you're a pussy
[01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:06.390]  So this guy with my old lady pounds the rest of the bottle. Yeah
[01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.910]  Yeah
[01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:10.910]  Yeah, yeah, let's not bring her into this
[01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:11.310]  All right
[01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:15.350]  So the article goes on it says when I ran into Rogan on the top floor of the theater in Northwest Denver
[01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:20.270]  He was adamant that the show was not how he imagined how he had imagined the December 8th event
[01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:23.990]  Which had been hyped by Rogan on social media as a 420 friendly affair
[01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:26.830]  The city said they shut us down if there was any smoking
[01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:30.790]  He said with the bottle of Juarez tequila in hand, but I can't control what you guys do
[01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:37.910]  Says Rogan couldn't maybe but Rogan couldn't but maybe the what's that cadre cater?
[01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:45.150]  I've never seen that word the big-ass group of secret service as security personnel definitely enforced the Colorado clean indoor air rules
[01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:49.470]  Asking several people in my section to leave during the screening for using vape pens
[01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:55.270]  There were also rumored to be a number of undercover police officers in the crowd in case there was any smoking taking place
[01:04:55.630 --> 01:05:00.430]  As this is the shit that happened in Colorado. You think you're gonna go somewhere and puff. You're not careful, dude
[01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.430]  It's not gonna happen at the Oriental Theatre
[01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:08.310]  Places it does happen at we keep our mouth shut about cuz I like doing it there. That's kind of true
[01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:13.290]  You don't see pictures of people standing around in circles and sidewalks
[01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:16.790]  You know like it's just not something that we take pictures of if you're here
[01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:20.390]  And you're cool, and we know you and stuff hold a grab you and take you to a place don't be shy
[01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:24.150]  Well, you'll definitely come with us. You know the cops don't go in the mountains here
[01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:28.550]  Don't blow our dab spots. We found some really cool adventurous
[01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:35.550]  So as the duo took stage Rogan started things off by saying fuck the police which elicited big cheers from the pro pot crowd
[01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:43.390]  Audience questions range from actual threats by North Korea over the film because Rogan having North Korea threatened nuclear war is not ideal yet
[01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:45.310]  We won't even go into that part
[01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:47.950]  So Rogan made sure to correct a question about smoking bowls
[01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:50.330]  He said first I smoke joints five to seven a day
[01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:57.550]  But on a night that was light on both joints and bowls more were left simply handing him various pot products for later
[01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:02.150]  In the state that is famously that famously legalized it most of the weed smoking
[01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:04.630]  cerebrity shiz
[01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:08.910]  Cerebrity shiz Lee that's a good fucking word took place in a side alley next to the theater
[01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:16.310]  Maybe next year Rogan exclaimed the way things are trending with pot consumption enforcement perhaps next year looks even worse
[01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:22.910]  Yeah, they're really cracking down we can't puff here in Colorado you have to be in a private house
[01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:25.950]  They want you at home smoking your pot. It's pretty much the only place
[01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:30.950]  Which there are a few hotels, sorry that advertised for 24
[01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:35.150]  Yeah, they do our favorite hotel that we drive past that we see that advertised
[01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:40.390]  It's in Manitou Springs. It's right outside of Manitou as we head back from the Monta factory
[01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:44.150]  You see the 420 friendly sign they've taken down the 420 friendly part
[01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:52.030]  They're probably still 420 friendly, but they probably had to just quit advertising such just to keep themselves out of trouble. Yeah
[01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:54.790]  Yeah the micro till
[01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:59.830]  Micro-tell here in Pueblo is for yeah. Yeah, they are. I've got a friend that works over there
[01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:03.230]  What's up D if you're listening shout out bro shout out to big D and little D
[01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:07.990]  Yeah, I think we stayed there when we first got over this way
[01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:11.710]  They only have a couple rooms that are actually 420 friendly
[01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:19.750]  Right if you just ask I mean and if they say no, then there's there's measurements to take but yeah
[01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:22.590]  All right guys, it looks like it's about time to wrap up the show
[01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:25.750]  We've been going for an hour and seven minutes. I hope your ADD didn't kick in
[01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.430]  I hope you made it through the whole show
[01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:30.230]  Don't forget to check out all of our sponsors guys pretty soon
[01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:35.270]  We'll have King Cola back on the show to talk more about organics. We have a couple questions about map and DAP for him
[01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:37.870]  We're gonna do eventually
[01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:43.030]  We're gonna do an additives lesson. I promise you since I have taken this new job at the spot being the master grower
[01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:46.590]  I do promise you that it will not deter or detract from the podcast
[01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:48.990]  We're still gonna do our best to put out kick-ass podcasts
[01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:54.270]  It may actually help me do some hydro lessons for you because everything we're doing there is on large-scale commercial hydro
[01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:57.510]  I get to kind of expand my hydro knowledge
[01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:01.270]  We're gonna do lessons on additives. I may have said that I don't know if I read that line
[01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:05.550]  Like what to add to your shit during what week so that you know when to boost it
[01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:12.150]  We talked about basic nudes now. We need to talk about additives. We're working towards episode 50 also 50 is gonna be fun
[01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:17.310]  You just be like a recap weren't we just like celebrating 25 I think so 25 weeks ago

[01:08:30.150 --> 01:08:31.990]  We'll see who we can't get to the show
[01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:35.790]  Maybe I can set up like 22 microphones and get everybody that's ever been on
[01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:39.750]  Onto the show all at once or something have another spot like you you did
[01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:43.150]  You know like we did at the brickyard. We're trying to find a public place. Maybe we can do that
[01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:46.990]  There is not gonna be go ahead. Let's give away something free. Oh
[01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:52.910]  Hygro indoor growing supplies is gonna step it up and give away something awesome. I like that
[01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:58.190]  Something cool, and I'm sure you got you know yeah, I got a t-shirt or a hat or some stickers

[01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:09.390]  Mine was for you man honestly and you know like bender of course he's keeping the service running
[01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:11.750]  Hey Fisher cut faster
[01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:16.870]  See I feel bad for him now because he was like I don't want to listen to your voice
[01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:20.590]  You know last week and now he's gonna have to listen to both of our voices this way
[01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:24.950]  So how long can we go on and just sit here you wait shit
[01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:28.710]  We'd be in the other room just set him up with the microphone and just walk away. He's a rapper
[01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:36.270]  He's a rapper fish is a rapper. He's tired of hearing your voice on a recording. Yes, tell him do you have some sympathy?
[01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:42.350]  Everyone to listen to him rapping the same shit over and over he just likes to complain about everything
[01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:48.110]  So that's what that's what when he goes to work is like never mind. I'm like I'll say
[01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:51.630]  Semi family
[01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:57.070]  I just would almost fool construction talk on you do they
[01:09:58.350 --> 01:10:02.950]  It's a love-hate relationship. They got you know I'm saying they'd love to piss each other the fuck right off
