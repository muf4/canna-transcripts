[00:16.240 --> 00:19.000]  they have all expired, so don't get too excited.

[00:39.320 --> 00:57.620]  Yeah, what's up, cannabis community?
[00:57.620 --> 01:01.180]  It's time for episode 62 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:01.180 --> 01:05.060]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:05.060 --> 01:06.980]  If you're a new grower or a professional grower,
[01:06.980 --> 01:08.980]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[01:08.980 --> 01:11.100]  if you're on probation and you can't smoke,
[01:11.100 --> 01:13.500]  if you're a cannabis activist or someone who's just curious
[01:13.500 --> 01:14.860]  about the current state of cannabis,
[01:14.860 --> 01:16.980]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:16.980 --> 01:19.660]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining me.
[01:19.660 --> 01:21.820]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band
[01:21.820 --> 01:23.060]  for letting me use their music on the show.
[01:23.060 --> 01:27.140]  Big, huge thanks to Kat and Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:27.140 --> 01:28.020]  Thanks for letting me play the music.
[01:28.020 --> 01:30.660]  The song you're hearing right now is called The Constant Struggle.
[01:30.660 --> 01:34.220]  So sitting at the table with me is our new guest, Mr. Paul Rosales.
[01:34.220 --> 01:35.060]  How are you doing, my friend?
[01:35.060 --> 01:35.420]  Good.
[01:35.420 --> 01:36.860]  Should I say your whole name or is that not a good thing?
[01:36.860 --> 01:37.500]  No, that's fine.
[01:37.500 --> 01:39.300]  All right. I thought about it right after I said it.
[01:39.300 --> 01:41.220]  And across the table from me is a returning guest.
[01:41.220 --> 01:42.820]  We got Clint Stewart with us. How are you doing, bro?
[01:42.820 --> 01:44.100]  What's up, everybody?
[01:44.100 --> 01:45.260]  Hey, everybody.
[01:45.260 --> 01:47.260]  Hey, guys.
[01:47.260 --> 01:49.180]  I'm going to turn down that music so we can talk a little bit.
[01:49.180 --> 01:50.580]  How are you guys doing today?
[01:50.580 --> 01:51.140]  Doing good.
[01:51.140 --> 01:52.900]  I'm so high, my voice got higher.
[01:52.900 --> 01:54.500]  Everybody's high except me.
[01:54.500 --> 01:56.300]  Oh, well, can we talk about why you're not high?
[01:56.300 --> 01:57.820]  Yeah, yeah. No, no. Go for it.
[01:57.820 --> 01:59.460]  Paul happens to be on probation.
[01:59.460 --> 02:00.020]  Probation.
[02:00.020 --> 02:01.020]  He was a bad little boy.
[02:01.020 --> 02:01.620]  I was.
[02:01.620 --> 02:02.460]  Got himself in trouble.
[02:02.460 --> 02:04.420]  We won't talk about what he did because I don't even know.
[02:04.420 --> 02:06.620]  I killed a man just to watch him die.
[02:06.620 --> 02:07.140]  Nice.
[02:07.140 --> 02:08.660]  I heard there's a song somebody wrote about him.
[02:08.660 --> 02:09.460]  I don't remember.
[02:09.460 --> 02:11.260]  Maybe Jim Cash.
[02:11.260 --> 02:11.940]  I'm not sure.
[02:11.940 --> 02:12.420]  Is that who it was?
[02:12.420 --> 02:13.100]  Never heard of him.
[02:13.100 --> 02:14.580]  I thought it was Jim Carrey.
[02:14.580 --> 02:16.460]  Jim Carrey wrote a song.
[02:16.460 --> 02:17.460]  OK, let's not.
[02:17.460 --> 02:19.820]  So before we go down this road, I want to warn everybody
[02:19.820 --> 02:21.660]  listening, these men are comedians
[02:21.660 --> 02:24.020]  and this could be a funny episode.
[02:24.020 --> 02:26.100]  You never know what's going to come out of these boys' mouths.
[02:26.100 --> 02:28.580]  If you've listened to previous episodes with Clint,
[02:28.580 --> 02:30.660]  they've already got funny shit to say because I see him already
[02:30.660 --> 02:32.180]  holding back jokes.
[02:32.180 --> 02:34.060]  If you've listened to any previous episodes with Clint,
[02:34.060 --> 02:34.900]  Clint is a jokester.
[02:34.900 --> 02:36.580]  This will be a very entertaining episode.
[02:36.580 --> 02:37.300]  I'll make sure of it.
[02:37.300 --> 02:38.140]  Clint will make sure of it.
[02:38.140 --> 02:40.380]  Paul will make sure of it.
[02:40.380 --> 02:42.060]  Since we're talking that you guys are comedians,
[02:42.060 --> 02:43.420]  let's just drop a plug right away.
[02:43.420 --> 02:46.420]  Where can the kind folks of Pueblo or Colorado see you?
[02:46.420 --> 02:49.580]  This will come out like the second week of April.
[02:49.580 --> 02:51.700]  So you're going to have to plan your plugs in advance.
[02:51.700 --> 02:55.260]  Well, you can see us every Thursday
[02:55.260 --> 02:58.780]  at the Rainbow for the Wild Cousins comedy open mic.
[02:58.780 --> 03:00.580]  That's in Pueblo on Santa Fe.
[03:00.580 --> 03:01.700]  The Rainbow Bar.
[03:01.700 --> 03:04.980]  April 7th, we have a show also at the Rainbow.
[03:04.980 --> 03:07.100]  For $5, you can see Mary Mack, who
[03:07.100 --> 03:08.700]  has been on a bunch of stuff.
[03:08.700 --> 03:12.020]  She's been on Last Comic Standing
[03:12.020 --> 03:14.420]  and a bunch of different comedy festivals.
[03:14.420 --> 03:17.500]  And apparently, she did a voice on Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
[03:17.500 --> 03:18.860]  So who was she on Aqua Teen?
[03:18.860 --> 03:19.420]  Do you know?
[03:19.420 --> 03:20.140]  I have no idea.
[03:20.140 --> 03:21.100]  Was she Carl?
[03:21.100 --> 03:21.860]  Yes.
[03:21.860 --> 03:22.980]  Yes.
[03:22.980 --> 03:25.660]  I think that time they had Rush on there,
[03:25.660 --> 03:26.580]  she played Geddy Lee.
[03:26.580 --> 03:27.740]  Nice.
[03:27.740 --> 03:28.620]  Nice.
[03:28.620 --> 03:29.700]  That makes sense.
[03:29.700 --> 03:31.180]  That's April 7th.
[03:31.180 --> 03:34.460]  She's coming with her husband, who has been on Letterman.
[03:34.460 --> 03:36.820]  I'm spacing the name right now, but you should just
[03:36.860 --> 03:38.580]  come check it out and come check us out
[03:38.580 --> 03:40.340]  every Thursday at the Rainbow.
[03:40.340 --> 03:40.860]  Yeah.
[03:40.860 --> 03:42.860]  This will come out the day before that, I think.
[03:42.860 --> 03:44.260]  So I think this will come out the 6th.
[03:44.260 --> 03:45.020]  I'm looking at my phone right now
[03:45.020 --> 03:45.780]  and trying to find the calendar.
[03:45.780 --> 03:46.500]  So yeah, the 7th.
[03:46.500 --> 03:47.900]  You guys, go tomorrow night.
[03:47.900 --> 03:50.500]  If you're listening to this on the 6th, go to the Rainbow Bar.
[03:50.500 --> 03:51.420]  It's in Pueblo.
[03:51.420 --> 03:54.140]  I have a friend who thought that was in Colorado Springs.
[03:54.140 --> 03:55.460]  They drove to Colorado Springs.
[03:55.460 --> 03:55.820]  What up?
[03:55.820 --> 03:57.180]  They looked for the Rainbow Bar.
[03:57.180 --> 03:57.580]  Yep.
[03:57.580 --> 03:59.820]  And they realized that it's in Pueblo, so they drove back home.
[03:59.820 --> 04:01.780]  And by the time they got there, I think they missed your show.
[04:01.780 --> 04:02.300]  Yeah.
[04:02.300 --> 04:03.100]  One of that happens.
[04:03.100 --> 04:03.740]  It's all right.
[04:03.740 --> 04:04.700]  It's free every week.
[04:04.700 --> 04:06.060]  Come down.
[04:07.620 --> 04:10.420]  Comedians get free pizza and a free drink.
[04:10.420 --> 04:11.220]  So that's fun.
[04:11.220 --> 04:12.900]  So what qualifies me as a comedian?
[04:12.900 --> 04:13.860]  Do I get up and tell a joke?
[04:13.860 --> 04:15.100]  Yeah, just get up there and tell a joke.
[04:15.100 --> 04:16.020]  Get some pizza.
[04:16.020 --> 04:16.820]  There we go, guys.
[04:16.820 --> 04:18.620]  Come to Open Mic Night at the Rainbow.
[04:18.620 --> 04:19.980]  And a free beer.
[04:19.980 --> 04:20.500]  Yeah.
[04:20.500 --> 04:20.980]  Yeah.
[04:20.980 --> 04:21.940]  And a free beer.
[04:21.940 --> 04:23.780]  You can have my free beer if I go get one,
[04:23.780 --> 04:24.860]  because I don't need the beer.
[04:24.860 --> 04:25.180]  Yeah.
[04:25.180 --> 04:25.660]  Awesome.
[04:25.660 --> 04:26.340]  Yeah, same here.
[04:26.340 --> 04:29.060]  Actually, now you're drinking again, aren't you?
[04:29.060 --> 04:29.940]  I don't drink.
[04:29.940 --> 04:31.020]  Paul does not drink.
[04:31.020 --> 04:33.340]  Two men in the room that three men in the room that don't drink.
[04:33.340 --> 04:35.220]  Alcohol does not agree with me.
[04:35.220 --> 04:36.500]  I do stupid shit.
[04:36.500 --> 04:37.620]  And so I don't do it.
[04:37.620 --> 04:38.540]  I'm allergic to alcohol.
[04:38.540 --> 04:40.260]  I break out in handcuffs and fat chicks.
[04:40.260 --> 04:41.740]  Yeah.
[04:41.740 --> 04:44.580]  I just get really angry and I say stuff that I don't mean.
[04:44.580 --> 04:47.340]  But I do that sober, so I don't know if that's alcohol.
[04:47.340 --> 04:48.700]  It just like multiplies with you.
[04:48.700 --> 04:49.180]  Yeah.
[04:49.180 --> 04:50.300]  It gives it another level.
[04:50.300 --> 04:50.780]  Yeah.
[04:50.780 --> 04:51.700]  It takes it all out.
[04:51.700 --> 04:52.300]  All right.
[04:52.300 --> 04:53.860]  Before we go too far, I should do the commercials,
[04:53.860 --> 04:55.460]  because we're going to get into this conversation.
[04:55.460 --> 04:56.740]  I can already tell.
[04:56.740 --> 04:59.580]  Huge, huge shout out to Bern and Jesse and the entire crew.

[05:28.460 --> 05:31.140]  I saw an ad today that they had Hortilux bulbs
[05:31.140 --> 05:32.780]  on sale for a ridiculous price.
[05:32.780 --> 05:35.780]  I think they were $69.99 for a 1,000 watt Hortilux bulb.

[05:56.980 --> 05:57.540]  Nice.
[05:57.540 --> 05:58.580]  I never went to college.
[05:58.580 --> 06:00.860]  I was going to say, I was just going to let that fly,
[06:00.860 --> 06:01.620]  and I want to say.
[06:01.620 --> 06:04.140]  It was that one time we were flyering at a college.
[06:04.140 --> 06:04.820]  Yeah.
[06:05.060 --> 06:06.580]  That makes you the red wiggler, bro.
[06:06.580 --> 06:07.380]  Yeah, I'm down.
[06:07.380 --> 06:08.740]  That sounds like a wrestler name.
[06:08.740 --> 06:12.020]  That sounds like my dog on his back.
[06:12.020 --> 06:13.460]  That's a red rocket.
[06:13.460 --> 06:14.540]  That's a little different.
[06:14.540 --> 06:15.380]  That wiggles.
[06:15.380 --> 06:16.340]  I'm skipping this.

[06:40.580 --> 06:41.100]  Bokashi.
[06:41.100 --> 06:42.620]  It sounds like Bukkake.

[06:53.340 --> 06:54.020]  Love those guys.
[06:54.020 --> 06:55.180]  They help us out a lot.
[06:55.180 --> 06:56.820]  If you want to sponsor the show, email me.
[06:56.820 --> 06:58.260]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[06:58.260 --> 07:03.140]  I'll get you all the information that you need.
[07:03.180 --> 07:03.580]  All right.
[07:03.580 --> 07:04.260]  That's enough ads.
[07:04.260 --> 07:05.780]  That's enough all that stuff.
[07:05.780 --> 07:07.780]  We've just got fun and games ahead of us now.
[07:07.780 --> 07:08.700]  Woo-hoo.
[07:08.700 --> 07:10.620]  Your comedians tell me a joke.
[07:10.620 --> 07:11.700]  I'm just kidding.
[07:11.700 --> 07:12.580]  Don't you hate that shit?
[07:12.580 --> 07:13.780]  Do people do that to you?
[07:13.780 --> 07:14.340]  You're a comedian.
[07:14.340 --> 07:14.900]  Make me laugh.
[07:14.900 --> 07:16.700]  It happens pretty regularly.
[07:16.700 --> 07:19.660]  It's silly because I still consider myself an open mic-er.
[07:19.660 --> 07:20.340]  Yeah.
[07:20.340 --> 07:27.060]  Comedian is something I aspire to be, but I don't like it.
[07:27.060 --> 07:28.060]  Oh, you're a comedian.
[07:28.060 --> 07:28.980]  Not really.
[07:28.980 --> 07:30.700]  I'm not getting paid for this.
[07:30.700 --> 07:32.220]  I'm a steel worker.
[07:32.260 --> 07:36.260]  I'll consider myself a comedian or consider the years I've been
[07:36.260 --> 07:39.380]  a comedian as many times as I claim it on my taxes and shit
[07:39.380 --> 07:39.780]  like that.
[07:39.780 --> 07:40.260]  Nice.
[07:40.260 --> 07:40.940]  Okay.
[07:40.940 --> 07:41.660]  That's fair enough.
[07:41.660 --> 07:42.500]  Respectable.
[07:42.500 --> 07:45.580]  When you actually start getting booked for gigs and stuff like
[07:45.580 --> 07:48.140]  that, we're just local feature guys.
[07:48.140 --> 07:50.980]  But you've got a lot of heart, dude, and that's what takes a
[07:50.980 --> 07:54.260]  lot of it is a lot of heart, and that's what you need.
[07:54.260 --> 07:56.300]  A lot of guys, they just don't have the heart.
[07:56.300 --> 07:58.220]  They want to go up there and repeat the same shit every week,
[07:58.220 --> 08:00.260]  and you can tell they're just doing it to just do it.
[08:00.260 --> 08:00.900]  You guys got the heart.
[08:00.900 --> 08:01.580]  You're putting in the work.
[08:01.580 --> 08:05.500]  I do it because it's a way for me to get all the negative shit
[08:05.500 --> 08:09.100]  I'm feeling about myself out, and if I can make people laugh
[08:09.100 --> 08:12.140]  from it, then it kind of validates all the shitty things
[08:12.140 --> 08:12.860]  that I've ever done.
[08:12.860 --> 08:15.900]  Well, that's kind of a self righteous way to look at it.
[08:15.900 --> 08:19.140]  It's very personal.
[08:19.140 --> 08:20.940]  I'm not doing it for anybody else.
[08:20.940 --> 08:23.900]  The way Paul does his comedy is self deprecatingly.
[08:23.900 --> 08:24.380]  Yeah.
[08:24.380 --> 08:28.940]  So, yeah, it might sound like, oh, he's doing it for himself,
[08:28.940 --> 08:32.140]  and it is, but it's also like, I need to tell you this.
[08:32.140 --> 08:32.460]  Yeah.
[08:32.460 --> 08:34.300]  It's a healthy way to get shit out.
[08:34.300 --> 08:37.100]  It's way cheaper than a therapist, and if you're making me laugh,
[08:37.100 --> 08:38.380]  we're both getting therapy out of it.
[08:38.380 --> 08:39.180]  So that's pretty cool.
[08:39.180 --> 08:43.980]  And a lot of the guys, we're always trying new stuff.
[08:43.980 --> 08:47.580]  There's only a few guys that kind of have fallen into a trap
[08:47.580 --> 08:54.300]  of not doing new stuff fairly regularly, but it's fun to see
[08:54.940 --> 08:58.060]  when a joke can fail, too, and you can see what he wanted
[08:58.060 --> 09:01.660]  to do with it, and it's like, damn, dude, if you'd have twisted this,
[09:01.660 --> 09:03.340]  that joke would have worked.
[09:03.340 --> 09:05.180]  It's neat seeing that stuff.
[09:05.180 --> 09:08.620]  So you get to see the initial and like, why didn't that work?
[09:08.620 --> 09:10.860]  And then you talk about it and, oh, OK.
[09:10.860 --> 09:12.540]  And you get to see it the next time he does it,
[09:12.540 --> 09:15.420]  and he's got a little bit more confidence because he's done it once.
[09:15.420 --> 09:19.900]  Like, open mic comedy is so fun to watch as an art form,
[09:19.900 --> 09:22.300]  not just the comedy that you're watching,
[09:22.300 --> 09:25.820]  but the comedy is the reason you're putting butts in seats.
[09:25.820 --> 09:26.220]  Yeah.
[09:26.220 --> 09:29.740]  But for us to watch guys evolve and get better,
[09:29.740 --> 09:33.660]  and like, perfect case in point was Dan Rainey.
[09:33.660 --> 09:33.980]  Absolutely.
[09:33.980 --> 09:35.900]  I heard a lot about Dan Rainey getting better.
[09:35.900 --> 09:38.860]  He was really not good when he started,
[09:39.900 --> 09:43.420]  but he went from not good, and he was OK,
[09:43.980 --> 09:47.100]  but he just, now he's good, and it came fast.
[09:47.100 --> 09:52.300]  It went a lot easier for him to go from not good to like, good.
[09:52.300 --> 09:54.380]  I think confidence had a lot to do with that.
[09:54.380 --> 09:56.060]  His material, I thought, was always funny.
[09:56.060 --> 09:58.460]  It's just when he told it, he was kind of unsure about it,
[09:58.460 --> 09:59.660]  and you can't really be unsure.
[09:59.660 --> 10:01.420]  But it took a lot to get him started, didn't it?
[10:01.420 --> 10:02.060]  Just to get him up the first time.
[10:02.060 --> 10:03.420]  Yeah, just to get him on stage.
[10:03.420 --> 10:08.220]  Like, he'd been coming to comedy shows since I first started doing comedy,
[10:08.220 --> 10:11.740]  and he was just so scared to get up on stage and tell a joke,
[10:11.740 --> 10:12.940]  and then he finally did it.
[10:12.940 --> 10:15.740]  And for some people, once you do it,
[10:15.740 --> 10:17.020]  that just opens up the floodgates.
[10:17.020 --> 10:18.140]  You can't stop doing it.
[10:18.140 --> 10:18.860]  Well, I'll admit it.
[10:19.500 --> 10:21.820]  As I was a teenager, I've watched comedy.
[10:21.820 --> 10:22.780]  You can tell from talking to me,
[10:22.780 --> 10:24.460]  and I've been into comedy as long as you guys have.
[10:24.460 --> 10:25.900]  I'm not, but I've been in that club,
[10:25.900 --> 10:28.860]  and I would love to walk up on stage and throw down one good set.
[10:29.420 --> 10:30.700]  And I've got a podcast.
[10:30.700 --> 10:32.620]  I'm obviously okay with talking in a group.
[10:32.620 --> 10:35.660]  We do grow meetings where I just run my mouth and talk about growing.
[10:35.660 --> 10:38.780]  Dude, I get, I just thinking about going up there to do a set.
[10:38.780 --> 10:39.740]  No, thank you.
[10:39.740 --> 10:40.860]  I want to shit my pants.
[10:41.500 --> 10:42.620]  It scares the shit out of me.
[10:42.620 --> 10:44.380]  That's the other part of it.
[10:44.380 --> 10:46.700]  I know I can't, I can't say I can't do it,
[10:46.700 --> 10:48.620]  but I know that that's not my wheelhouse.
[10:48.620 --> 10:49.020]  Yeah.
[10:49.020 --> 10:51.260]  It's just weird for me to even think about getting up there.
[10:51.260 --> 10:54.300]  But at the party or whatever, I'll tell everybody a joke all day long.
[10:54.300 --> 10:56.620]  That's the other part of it, though, is when you get up there,
[10:56.620 --> 10:59.020]  and you really feel like you have something to say,
[10:59.020 --> 11:00.300]  and you want to tell these people something,
[11:00.300 --> 11:01.420]  and they don't laugh at all.
[11:01.420 --> 11:02.700]  It's so heartbreaking.
[11:02.700 --> 11:03.260]  Yeah.
[11:03.260 --> 11:03.900]  Yeah.
[11:03.900 --> 11:05.020]  But that's soul crushing.
[11:05.020 --> 11:09.180]  But that's the thing that I like watching in other guys and in myself,
[11:09.180 --> 11:12.220]  is you watch these guys, like I was trying to get to with Dan,
[11:12.220 --> 11:14.940]  is like he evolved, and you could see that evolution every step,
[11:14.940 --> 11:15.660]  and it was neat.
[11:16.220 --> 11:18.380]  And I think that, you know,
[11:18.380 --> 11:20.380]  there's guys that don't want to come out to show us all.
[11:20.380 --> 11:22.540]  They tell the same jokes or something like that.
[11:22.540 --> 11:26.220]  But it's like, no, like, look at the new thing that he did to the end.
[11:26.220 --> 11:26.780]  I don't know.
[11:26.780 --> 11:29.260]  Like, I know that we're probably getting pretty deep on like.
[11:29.260 --> 11:30.220]  Oh, no, it's like writing.
[11:30.220 --> 11:32.300]  It's like getting tailoring that joke.
[11:32.300 --> 11:33.900]  It's I understand what you're saying.
[11:33.900 --> 11:34.380]  And it does.
[11:34.380 --> 11:36.060]  It's not something it's like making a recipe.
[11:36.060 --> 11:36.460]  Perfect.
[11:36.460 --> 11:38.540]  The first time you make that recipe, it was too spicy.
[11:38.540 --> 11:39.660]  But you knew what you're aiming for.
[11:39.660 --> 11:42.060]  He took out a little spice, added more garlic.
[11:42.060 --> 11:42.860]  It's like watching.
[11:42.860 --> 11:43.740]  And I've seen you do it.
[11:43.740 --> 11:47.420]  I've watched your joke telling evolve, not just your jokes get better,
[11:47.420 --> 11:48.940]  but your approach to telling a joke.
[11:48.940 --> 11:50.860]  You don't have to get naked to have a punch line anymore.
[11:50.860 --> 11:52.780]  Because your jokes have some body to them.
[11:52.780 --> 11:53.500]  Keep your clothes on.
[11:53.500 --> 11:54.620]  That was a long time ago.
[11:54.620 --> 11:56.700]  That was one of the best bits I've ever seen.
[11:56.700 --> 11:57.580]  Hey, thanks, buddy.
[11:57.580 --> 11:59.020]  Yeah, that was amazing.
[11:59.020 --> 11:59.740]  Jesus.
[11:59.740 --> 12:01.580]  I'm going to do that joke for everybody right now.
[12:03.580 --> 12:05.820]  Yeah, I get it.
[12:05.820 --> 12:06.700]  Because it's a visual bit.
[12:09.100 --> 12:11.180]  And that's how that's going to fail as a joke.
[12:12.140 --> 12:14.620]  I'm looking for Dan Rady's Twitter feed so that we can get it.
[12:15.660 --> 12:16.780]  At Dan Champion.
[12:16.780 --> 12:17.420]  There you go.
[12:17.420 --> 12:18.700]  Look for at Dan Champion.
[12:18.700 --> 12:19.740]  Just follow him randomly.
[12:19.740 --> 12:21.980]  You'll have no idea why he got a bump on Twitter.
[12:21.980 --> 12:23.660]  He's a really funny guy coming out of the springs.
[12:23.660 --> 12:25.900]  There's a few funny people coming out of the springs.
[12:25.900 --> 12:27.660]  But I think he's one of the funnier ones.
[12:28.540 --> 12:29.820]  And he's really working at it.
[12:29.820 --> 12:31.020]  And it's neat to see that.
[12:31.020 --> 12:36.460]  So it's definitely it's like having a second job when you're not getting paid for it.
[12:36.460 --> 12:37.740]  You're not getting paid for it.
[12:37.740 --> 12:38.540]  Yeah, you're not good.
[12:38.540 --> 12:39.420]  But it doesn't it.
[12:39.420 --> 12:41.660]  I'm a musician and I've gone and played free shows.
[12:41.660 --> 12:45.420]  And just that I know that feeling of just locking in with the bass player and getting a song right.
[12:45.980 --> 12:47.420]  That was worth my setup time.
[12:47.420 --> 12:48.940]  My couple hours on stage.
[12:48.940 --> 12:49.260]  Yeah.
[12:49.260 --> 12:49.820]  Oh, for sure.
[12:49.820 --> 12:55.340]  To drive to wherever and go do 15 minutes is really nice.
[12:55.340 --> 12:56.540]  Sometimes five.
[12:56.540 --> 12:58.540]  Yeah, you'll drive up to go do five.
[12:58.540 --> 12:59.260]  You'll do 10.
[12:59.260 --> 13:04.540]  You know, you'll do 15 just because they're like, oh, you drove from Pueblo.
[13:04.540 --> 13:05.020]  Cool.
[13:05.020 --> 13:06.940]  Like, do you have 15 minutes now?
[13:08.380 --> 13:09.180]  Yeah, probably.
[13:09.980 --> 13:12.540]  I think I can get about 15 with all of my material.
[13:13.100 --> 13:14.380]  I don't use a lot of old stuff.
[13:14.380 --> 13:16.860]  Are you exploiting your jail experience for material?
[13:16.860 --> 13:17.580]  I have.
[13:17.580 --> 13:18.860]  OK, I definitely have some.
[13:19.740 --> 13:21.660]  A jail material and a recent break.
[13:21.660 --> 13:23.980]  You should write a joke about I did not get raped.
[13:25.020 --> 13:26.060]  Well, I did get raped.
[13:26.060 --> 13:27.500]  OK, first of all, good.
[13:27.500 --> 13:29.420]  Just my comedy is very personal.
[13:29.420 --> 13:34.140]  Like I have to be 100% honest with my writing and my comedy because I feel like that's the
[13:34.140 --> 13:38.060]  only way that I can really find my own voice because I'm still looking for it.
[13:38.060 --> 13:40.620]  I don't really know what I'm exactly doing it.
[13:40.620 --> 13:43.820]  I just write from what I'm still confused if you did or did not get raped because you're
[13:43.820 --> 13:45.500]  a comedian and it's awkward over here a little.
[13:45.500 --> 13:45.980]  I didn't.
[13:47.500 --> 13:49.740]  Quit winking after you say I didn't.
[13:49.740 --> 13:50.540]  This is weird.
[13:50.540 --> 13:53.340]  Surprisingly not touching my leg while you do it.
[13:53.340 --> 13:55.340]  Not a lot of rape in PCJ.
[13:56.300 --> 13:56.860]  I did.
[13:56.860 --> 14:01.420]  I did have a friend who was in there who was apparently someone's bitch and that made me
[14:01.420 --> 14:02.220]  feel a little weird.
[14:02.220 --> 14:03.420]  That's kind of fun just to see that.
[14:03.420 --> 14:05.900]  But because we are going to talk about weed in the show, too, it's not just going to be
[14:05.900 --> 14:07.100]  prison sex the whole time.
[14:07.100 --> 14:07.580]  Nope.
[14:07.580 --> 14:12.140]  There wasn't there wasn't any sex or anything, but he would give him like foot rubs and clean
[14:12.140 --> 14:14.780]  his clothes and like they would share commissary.
[14:14.780 --> 14:16.060]  Yeah, it was weird.
[14:16.060 --> 14:16.780]  There's like these weird.
[14:16.780 --> 14:17.260]  His bitch.
[14:19.180 --> 14:23.580]  That are assigned to you when you're in jail for like a considerable amount of time.
[14:23.580 --> 14:27.340]  And I was only in there for 16 days, but I still got assigned a certain role for a thug
[14:27.340 --> 14:27.740]  like you.
[14:27.740 --> 14:31.100]  I bet that 16 days is just for for a bitch like me.
[14:31.740 --> 14:34.540]  That 16 days was the worst 16 days of my life.
[14:34.540 --> 14:38.460]  Hashtag man boobs by by day six.
[14:38.460 --> 14:39.740]  He was the adabasi.
[14:40.060 --> 14:42.940]  So you were you were about to tell me what your role was.
[14:42.940 --> 14:43.820]  I want to hear that.
[14:43.820 --> 14:46.380]  My role was story time.
[14:46.380 --> 14:51.740]  I would I would tell stories at night so people can go to sleep because they couldn't sleep
[14:51.740 --> 14:53.660]  after a while without hearing some kind of story.
[14:53.660 --> 14:54.700]  And it didn't get raped.
[14:54.700 --> 14:56.460]  And when you talk, everyone falls asleep.
[14:57.420 --> 14:58.620]  Nobody liked you in jail.
[14:59.180 --> 15:01.100]  Oh, people loved me in jail.
[15:01.100 --> 15:05.420]  I had kosher trays that I would trade for paper because I didn't have any money on my
[15:05.420 --> 15:07.500]  on my my books or anything like that.
[15:07.500 --> 15:14.620]  So I found out like Nazis will fucking give me their teenage daughters for some jew peanut
[15:14.620 --> 15:15.340]  butter.
[15:15.340 --> 15:16.140]  They don't give a fuck.
[15:18.140 --> 15:18.620]  All right.
[15:18.620 --> 15:19.740]  And I got fresh fruit.
[15:19.740 --> 15:20.460]  That was cool.
[15:20.460 --> 15:22.460]  Yeah, that's what I need if I'm in jail.
[15:22.460 --> 15:23.660]  That's definitely what I want.
[15:24.380 --> 15:27.900]  I only did 15 days and that was almost 10 years ago.
[15:27.900 --> 15:29.580]  So that was a long time ago.
[15:29.580 --> 15:31.020]  I don't have any jail stories.
[15:31.020 --> 15:31.740]  Yeah, either do I.
[15:31.740 --> 15:32.540]  I'm proud of us.
[15:32.540 --> 15:33.660]  Let's behave ourselves.
[15:33.660 --> 15:34.940]  Yeah, no more jail.
[15:34.940 --> 15:36.060]  No more jail.
[15:36.060 --> 15:37.340]  That's why I'm doing it right.
[15:37.660 --> 15:41.660]  Now that cannabis is legal in Colorado, I don't do anything that would even like make
[15:41.660 --> 15:42.860]  me worth being in trouble.
[15:42.860 --> 15:46.940]  That was the only thing I ever did was smoke too much weed and just dab out all day.
[15:46.940 --> 15:48.060]  No one can worry.
[15:48.060 --> 15:48.300]  Yeah.
[15:48.860 --> 15:49.340]  All right.
[15:49.340 --> 15:49.580]  Yeah.
[15:49.580 --> 15:51.500]  Come to Colorado, wussies.
[15:51.500 --> 15:55.740]  Wussies or my my advice, since Colorado is getting full and it's getting expensive to
[15:55.740 --> 15:58.780]  rent a house here, make cannabis legal where you are.
[15:58.780 --> 15:59.820]  You can do that there, too.
[15:59.820 --> 16:00.140]  Yes.
[16:00.140 --> 16:01.020]  Don't have to come.
[16:01.020 --> 16:01.660]  Oh, you can.
[16:01.660 --> 16:03.820]  I mean, it's cool if you're hot and you wear yoga pants.
[16:03.820 --> 16:04.700]  Come here.
[16:04.700 --> 16:07.020]  But like if you're just coming here just to grow some weed.
[16:07.980 --> 16:12.940]  If you're easy and you don't mind a fat, chubby guy on top of you, definitely come here.
[16:14.460 --> 16:17.340]  That's a sales pitch you cannot argue with right there.
[16:17.340 --> 16:17.900]  I like it.
[16:17.900 --> 16:18.380]  Fat, chubby.
[16:18.380 --> 16:19.580]  I'll get on top of you.
[16:19.580 --> 16:21.020]  I'll smother you all night long.
[16:21.020 --> 16:23.180]  I won't get on top of you if you're really scared.
[16:23.180 --> 16:24.380]  You can get on top of me.
[16:24.380 --> 16:28.700]  And it's like it's like, you know, a fun air mattress with a penis.
[16:30.060 --> 16:31.980]  It's like the little blow up nub on the air.
[16:31.980 --> 16:33.180]  Exactly.
[16:33.180 --> 16:33.660]  All right.
[16:33.740 --> 16:37.740]  I want to read a news article because Clint actually told me that he had a question for
[16:37.740 --> 16:41.100]  me and I'm going to my text message to try to remember what that question was.
[16:41.100 --> 16:42.460]  Was it Jamaica?
[16:42.460 --> 16:42.940]  Yes.
[16:42.940 --> 16:43.260]  Yes.
[16:44.780 --> 16:46.940]  And also about using cannabis as a sacrament.
[16:46.940 --> 16:51.980]  We talked a little bit about Jamaica legalizing cannabis for medical use on a past episode.
[16:51.980 --> 16:53.420]  It was either the last one or the one before.
[16:55.020 --> 16:56.460]  And they also have made it.
[16:56.460 --> 16:59.660]  It used to be if you were caught with any cannabis in Jamaica, it would be a seven day
[17:00.300 --> 17:01.980]  sentence in a Jamaican jail.
[17:01.980 --> 17:05.740]  And it's nothing like the little luxury condo that you just spent some time in.
[17:05.740 --> 17:06.140]  Shit.
[17:06.140 --> 17:06.620]  It would be.
[17:06.620 --> 17:08.140]  Ever been to Pueblo County Jail?
[17:08.140 --> 17:10.220]  No, but I've heard some good stories.
[17:10.220 --> 17:15.100]  It's the everyone in their trade stories of like where to get arrested.
[17:15.100 --> 17:16.460]  It's like you got to go to Crowley County.
[17:16.460 --> 17:17.100]  They have carpet.
[17:19.020 --> 17:22.700]  But like apparently Pueblo County Jail is the worst facility in the state.
[17:22.700 --> 17:22.940]  Wow.
[17:22.940 --> 17:23.900]  Well, I would believe that.
[17:23.900 --> 17:24.460]  Yeah.
[17:24.460 --> 17:27.100]  Well, then the Jamaican jail is it's still going to be worse.
[17:27.100 --> 17:28.220]  Yeah, of course.
[17:28.220 --> 17:31.900]  But so and now in Jamaica, if you get caught with cannabis, it's just a fine.
[17:31.900 --> 17:33.020]  You don't go to jail right away.
[17:33.020 --> 17:35.340]  It's like a $200 fine if you have less than an ounce.
[17:35.340 --> 17:36.620]  So now guys like us can go.
[17:36.620 --> 17:41.020]  And also they've made it to where if you have a medical marijuana card in the States,
[17:41.020 --> 17:46.220]  you can go there and register your medical marijuana card for a small fee and get a
[17:46.220 --> 17:50.540]  pass to buy medical marijuana while you were in Jamaica from their stores.
[17:50.540 --> 17:50.780]  Yeah.
[17:50.780 --> 17:52.300]  I heard their weed sucks though.
[17:52.300 --> 17:56.940]  It's not going to now because a lot of people from the United States saw this coming that
[17:56.940 --> 17:58.300]  cannabis was going to be legalized.
[17:58.300 --> 18:01.420]  And I have friends in the industry that have already flown down there and set up shops
[18:01.420 --> 18:02.780]  and testing labs.
[18:02.780 --> 18:06.300]  And BC Bubble Man was down there teaching everybody how to make good hash.
[18:06.300 --> 18:08.300]  So it's going on down there.
[18:08.300 --> 18:08.540]  Yeah.
[18:09.340 --> 18:13.740]  So that's kind of what I can tell you about Jamaica without talking too much about what
[18:13.740 --> 18:15.260]  we said on another episode.
[18:15.260 --> 18:20.060]  But then you asked me, ironically, you said, how about using cannabis as a sacrament?
[18:20.700 --> 18:24.140]  And then today I look at the cannabis and there it's the news page.
[18:24.140 --> 18:25.900]  I check out the cannabis.
[18:25.900 --> 18:29.740]  Their headline is new in Indiana, a cannabis church gets its chance.
[18:29.740 --> 18:29.980]  Yeah.
[18:29.980 --> 18:32.380]  I think that's where I got that idea for that question.
[18:32.380 --> 18:33.180]  Ah, nice.
[18:33.180 --> 18:39.260]  Was because Indiana passed that law that allows people to discriminate against gays.
[18:40.220 --> 18:46.140]  Like now, like as a part of religion, is it okay to smoke weed there?
[18:46.140 --> 18:46.460]  Right.
[18:46.460 --> 18:49.660]  And it has to be because they can't tell you what to do by that law.
[18:49.660 --> 18:49.900]  Yeah.
[18:49.900 --> 18:50.860]  I didn't read the law.
[18:50.860 --> 18:52.300]  If you're going to uphold one, you got to uphold the other.
[18:52.300 --> 18:53.500]  I'll read the whole article here.
[18:53.500 --> 18:56.540]  The sub headline says, if someone is smoking in our church, God bless them.
[18:56.540 --> 19:01.180]  Church founder Bill Levin says, this is a church to show a proper way of life, a loving
[19:01.180 --> 19:01.740]  way of life.
[19:01.740 --> 19:04.700]  We're all called canatarians.
[19:04.700 --> 19:06.620]  I don't know how I feel about the word canatarians.
[19:06.620 --> 19:08.940]  They all wear Reeboks and drink the punch.
[19:08.940 --> 19:09.900]  That's really interesting.
[19:09.900 --> 19:13.260]  I actually have something cannabis related to add to that.
[19:13.260 --> 19:14.940]  Well, let's hear it before we get into the article.
[19:14.940 --> 19:18.300]  The, uh, a lot of Jews smoke pot.
[19:18.300 --> 19:19.100]  They smoke weed.
[19:19.100 --> 19:24.300]  And a lot of them, especially now with like the younger, like more alternative Hasidic
[19:24.300 --> 19:27.820]  groups that are coming up, like in New York, like the non-ox and everything like that.
[19:27.820 --> 19:32.780]  They, uh, they use it as a sort of way to go back to their cultural roots.
[19:32.780 --> 19:37.900]  The holy anointing oil had, um, uh, cannabosam in it, which is cannabis.
[19:38.780 --> 19:42.460]  And it had so much in it that it would have psychoactive effects in it.
[19:42.460 --> 19:47.980]  And in other cases, they think that when the high priest would go into a tent to speak
[19:47.980 --> 19:55.020]  to God, they would use, um, things like cannabosam, different other herbs and stuff and incense
[19:55.020 --> 19:58.620]  and olive oil and, uh, the THC oil and everything.
[19:58.620 --> 20:01.820]  And they would just basically hotbox themselves as a way to speak to God.
[20:02.620 --> 20:04.380]  And, uh, Paul's Jewish by the way.
[20:04.380 --> 20:10.620]  Yeah, very, very, there's a book about it called, uh, cannabis Hasidim that if anyone's
[20:10.620 --> 20:12.940]  interested, they should definitely check that one out for sure.
[20:12.940 --> 20:13.660]  Myself.
[20:13.660 --> 20:14.860]  I will read that.
[20:14.860 --> 20:15.340]  Yeah.
[20:15.340 --> 20:17.100]  A lot of religions use cannabis.
[20:17.100 --> 20:20.460]  I think, uh, not just the Rastafarians use cannabis.
[20:20.460 --> 20:24.460]  Uh, if, and there's something, even if you're not from part of the world where cannabis
[20:24.460 --> 20:26.780]  was, there is something very similar where you were.
[20:26.780 --> 20:29.100]  And actually cannabis seems to have made its way all the way around the world.
[20:29.100 --> 20:32.940]  So everybody was smoking cannabis, all of the religions, the Saudis have smoked it and
[20:32.940 --> 20:35.980]  the Saudis get overlooked a lot, but yeah, I'm going to read this article.
[20:35.980 --> 20:37.020]  I totally agree with what you're saying.
[20:37.020 --> 20:38.140]  I'm going to read the article.
[20:38.140 --> 20:38.860]  All right.
[20:38.860 --> 20:41.980]  So the article is by Sarah Pulliam Bailey from the Washington post.
[20:41.980 --> 20:46.220]  And it says the first church of cannabis incorporated has been approved by Indiana secretary of
[20:46.220 --> 20:46.540]  state.
[20:46.540 --> 20:51.020]  After the state's religious freedom legislation became law last week, the church's founder,
[20:51.020 --> 20:55.660]  Bill Levin said he filed paperwork in a direct response to Indiana governor, Mike Pence's
[20:55.660 --> 21:00.780]  signing the religious freedom restoration act into law last Thursday, secretary of state,
[21:00.780 --> 21:05.980]  Connie Lawson approved the church as a religious corporation with all the stated intent to
[21:05.980 --> 21:11.420]  start a church based on love and understanding with compassion for all a cannabis is listed
[21:11.420 --> 21:13.260]  as the church's sacrament and its doctrine.
[21:13.260 --> 21:15.820]  Levin said, and he will set up a church hierarchy.
[21:15.820 --> 21:17.820]  The church will plan to grow hemp.
[21:17.820 --> 21:20.620]  He said, though, they will not buy or sell marijuana.
[21:21.260 --> 21:23.500]  If someone is smoking in our church, God bless them.
[21:23.500 --> 21:27.420]  Levin said, this is a church to show a proper way of life, a loving way of life.
[21:27.420 --> 21:29.340]  We're called canitarians.
[21:29.340 --> 21:33.020]  I wonder if they kind of linked that word from the Rastafarians a little bit.
[21:33.740 --> 21:34.860]  Unitarians, maybe.
[21:34.860 --> 21:36.780]  Unitarians, any kind of Aryans, huh?
[21:38.140 --> 21:39.420]  Big fan of the Aryans.
[21:39.420 --> 21:40.460]  Yeah, I'm sure you are.
[21:41.020 --> 21:42.620]  I have seen your swastika tattoo.
[21:42.620 --> 21:43.020]  Oh yeah.
[21:43.740 --> 21:44.620]  I have two.
[21:44.620 --> 21:45.900]  It matches your Hitler mustache.
[21:45.900 --> 21:47.340]  One on each ball.
[21:47.340 --> 21:49.420]  Is that something we're doing here in Colorado?
[21:49.420 --> 21:51.660]  Is there those sects up?
[21:51.660 --> 21:55.180]  Like there's actually Green Faith Ministries, which is a cannabis related church.
[21:55.900 --> 21:56.860]  Here in Pueblo?
[21:56.860 --> 21:57.740]  It's in Denver.
[21:57.740 --> 22:00.140]  I think they're in Greeley or Gree.
[22:00.140 --> 22:01.020]  I think they're in Greeley.
[22:01.020 --> 22:05.180]  There was a group in Springs when my old band, Stem Beach Soul Revival.
[22:05.180 --> 22:05.660]  Shout out.
[22:05.660 --> 22:06.940]  Check them out on Facebook.
[22:06.940 --> 22:08.060]  I think they're still doing stuff.
[22:08.060 --> 22:08.860]  They're doing stuff.
[22:09.660 --> 22:14.540]  We played a dab party at Hookah Bar in Pueblo.
[22:15.100 --> 22:20.700]  And there was a guy who was out there handing out like sacramental joints and stuff like that.
[22:20.700 --> 22:24.380]  Yeah, I actually took about an ounce of hash and dabbed everybody out.
[22:24.380 --> 22:26.300]  Yeah, I remember that.
[22:26.300 --> 22:27.340]  That was a fun night.
[22:27.340 --> 22:27.580]  Yeah.
[22:28.140 --> 22:30.140]  That was the first time I ever dabbed.
[22:30.140 --> 22:31.180]  Was it the last time?
[22:31.180 --> 22:32.140]  It wasn't the last time.
[22:32.140 --> 22:35.900]  I dabbed a few times on here, but that was a long time ago.
[22:35.900 --> 22:37.820]  One time I got him so high he had to get up and leave.
[22:39.100 --> 22:42.380]  And then John Bueno turned as wide as the walls.
[22:42.380 --> 22:42.860]  Yeah.
[22:42.860 --> 22:43.580]  Was it John Bueno?
[22:43.580 --> 22:45.500]  Yeah, I think John Bueno took a dab and turned as wide as the walls.
[22:45.500 --> 22:47.500]  No, John Bueno wouldn't have taken a dab.
[22:47.500 --> 22:48.140]  No.
[22:48.140 --> 22:49.500]  I think it was Luke Cowey, wasn't it?
[22:49.500 --> 22:51.020]  Oh, no, it was Previn.
[22:51.020 --> 22:54.620]  There's been so many people at this table that we've dabbed out that have just turned to pale.
[22:54.620 --> 22:55.340]  Yeah.
[22:55.340 --> 22:55.580]  Yeah.
[22:55.580 --> 22:55.820]  Sorry.
[22:56.540 --> 22:59.500]  Dabs, I don't know how I feel about dabs.
[23:00.940 --> 23:02.060]  Dabs do, Jeff.
[23:02.060 --> 23:03.340]  Dabs look like drugs.
[23:03.340 --> 23:03.820]  Oh, it does.
[23:03.820 --> 23:04.220]  I'm sure.
[23:04.220 --> 23:07.260]  When you break out a blowtorch and you start heating that shit up, I'm sure it does.
[23:07.260 --> 23:08.140]  It looks like drugs.
[23:08.140 --> 23:08.300]  Yeah.
[23:08.300 --> 23:10.540]  Guys, when you're dabbing somewhere, just remember that.
[23:10.540 --> 23:12.780]  That you're using a torch and it looks like we're heating up some crack.
[23:12.780 --> 23:13.820]  It seriously does.
[23:13.820 --> 23:20.860]  So if people are discriminating against you for doing dabs, I am too because it looks like drugs.
[23:20.860 --> 23:21.980]  You guys are ruining weed.
[23:21.980 --> 23:22.780]  It's too much.
[23:23.660 --> 23:24.780]  It's too much for me.
[23:25.420 --> 23:29.660]  I know it's supposedly cleaner than smoking the actual plant.
[23:29.660 --> 23:30.780]  Well, yeah, there's just less-
[23:30.780 --> 23:32.380]  Yeah, there's less crap that you're smoking.
[23:32.380 --> 23:34.380]  You're smoking the more pure form of it and all.
[23:34.380 --> 23:35.180]  And butane.
[23:35.180 --> 23:36.700]  It just fucks me up so much.
[23:36.700 --> 23:38.300]  Well, don't they do it like a different method now?
[23:38.300 --> 23:39.180]  Yeah, there's no butane.
[23:39.180 --> 23:42.380]  Yeah, the method you're probably talking about is RosinTech, where we're just using
[23:43.180 --> 23:47.500]  pressing comb, like a straightening iron, squeezing the juice out of the blood by that way.
[23:47.500 --> 23:50.540]  But with the BHO, the butane, there's no butane left in our product.
[23:51.180 --> 23:51.980]  We're getting it clean.
[23:51.980 --> 23:53.660]  We figured out how to clean it out real well.
[23:53.660 --> 23:54.300]  That's good.
[23:54.300 --> 23:55.100]  You are.
[23:55.100 --> 23:55.740]  Yeah.
[23:55.740 --> 23:59.420]  I smoke cigarettes, so I don't really care about butane or anything like that.
[23:59.420 --> 24:01.260]  I'm putting horrible things into my body.
[24:01.260 --> 24:02.140]  Yummy.
[24:02.140 --> 24:03.740]  And that's a shout out to cigarettes.
[24:03.740 --> 24:06.300]  I don't know if you guys ever smoked those before, but give them a try.
[24:06.300 --> 24:06.940]  They're fun.
[24:06.940 --> 24:08.860]  We had to talk about that on a previous episode.
[24:09.420 --> 24:10.540]  There were three guys in the room.
[24:10.540 --> 24:12.460]  I took like a half gram dab and didn't choke.
[24:12.460 --> 24:16.060]  And the other two guys are cigarette smokers, and they took little tiny dabs and had to get up and
[24:16.060 --> 24:18.140]  leave so they could go hockaloogies and die for a minute.
[24:18.140 --> 24:18.700]  Yeah.
[24:18.700 --> 24:22.380]  If you want to take fat dabs, if you want to do big hikes, if you want to go high in elevation,
[24:22.380 --> 24:23.900]  if you want to live long, don't smoke.
[24:23.900 --> 24:27.020]  If you want to be a productive, good human being, don't smoke cigarettes.
[24:27.020 --> 24:27.580]  Yeah.
[24:27.580 --> 24:28.780]  I'm not one of those people though.
[24:28.780 --> 24:29.420]  They're nasty.
[24:29.420 --> 24:32.060]  Also, if you don't want to get old, smoke cigarettes.
[24:32.060 --> 24:33.820]  I don't really care.
[24:33.820 --> 24:36.140]  No, I don't want you to get old either.
[24:36.140 --> 24:36.620]  Well, yeah.
[24:37.500 --> 24:38.620]  Old saggy tits.
[24:38.780 --> 24:39.280]  Ugh.
[24:39.900 --> 24:40.780]  Hey, I'm losing.
[24:40.780 --> 24:43.420]  I lost 38 pounds since I went into jail.
[24:43.420 --> 24:44.140]  Nice.
[24:44.140 --> 24:44.640]  Yeah.
[24:45.900 --> 24:46.940]  Losing these man tits.
[24:46.940 --> 24:47.660]  There you go.
[24:47.660 --> 24:49.100]  Ladies, less fat.
[24:49.100 --> 24:49.500]  Come on.
[24:50.540 --> 24:52.140]  Still all the funny, half the fat.
[24:52.140 --> 24:57.740]  Still fat, but less this time, which is really like, I wish all my ex-girlfriends would come
[24:57.740 --> 25:00.940]  back because I think this is like the least amount I've weighed in my whole life.
[25:01.500 --> 25:06.300]  So I feel like Paul has a few things he needs to get off his chest because he keeps going
[25:06.300 --> 25:07.500]  back to a specific topic.
[25:07.500 --> 25:08.540]  No, no, no, no.
[25:08.860 --> 25:09.580]  That's three times.
[25:10.780 --> 25:13.100]  This is my entire spectrum of ex-girlfriends.
[25:13.100 --> 25:16.140]  I want to give them a chance to come fuck me again now that I'm better looking.
[25:16.700 --> 25:21.580]  So if any of you out there ever hear this and you want to come back, I'm more active.
[25:22.380 --> 25:23.420]  I'm more attractive.
[25:23.420 --> 25:26.300]  So it's really up to you.
[25:26.300 --> 25:28.620]  And he's kind of thug now because he spent some time in the slammer.
[25:28.620 --> 25:29.180]  A little thug.
[25:29.180 --> 25:33.340]  I made a lot of friends in there who want me to do nefarious things for them.
[25:33.340 --> 25:33.740]  I'm sure.
[25:33.740 --> 25:36.700]  Oh, yeah, because they can't wait to get out and get back into trouble.
[25:36.700 --> 25:37.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[25:37.500 --> 25:39.180]  His eyebrows say thug life.
[25:40.380 --> 25:43.100]  He's got a 13 tattooed on the inside of his lip.
[25:43.900 --> 25:45.340]  It looks good with your teardrop tattoo.
[25:45.340 --> 25:48.860]  I heard a lot of fucked up stories from Mexican cartel guys.
[25:49.420 --> 25:52.860]  Like this one kid that I was in there with, he's not a kid, he's like 25.
[25:52.860 --> 25:57.260]  But he apparently fucked two chickens to death when he was like 13 in Mexico.
[25:57.260 --> 25:59.100]  All right, I'm going to keep reading this article from the campus.
[25:59.740 --> 26:04.540]  It says, marijuana is currently illegal in Indiana for both medical and recreational use,
[26:04.540 --> 26:06.940]  so the church could test the application of the new law.
[26:07.740 --> 26:14.060]  RFRA prevents Indiana's government from substantially burgeoning a person's exercise
[26:14.060 --> 26:17.260]  of religion if it can demonstrate that it is at least the risk.
[26:18.380 --> 26:19.180]  Let me try that again.
[26:19.180 --> 26:20.940]  I'm still fucked up from what Paul just said.
[26:20.940 --> 26:24.620]  If it can demonstrate that it is the least restrictive means of furthering
[26:24.620 --> 26:26.700]  a compelling governmental interest.
[26:26.700 --> 26:28.700]  Just the best segue of ever.
[26:29.740 --> 26:33.020]  When we asked him why he did it, he just said, because it's Mexico.
[26:34.700 --> 26:36.780]  So Mexico, you have some explaining to do.
[26:38.220 --> 26:40.780]  Oh, did he behead the chickens when he was done?
[26:40.780 --> 26:42.860]  I don't know if they ate him or what.
[26:42.860 --> 26:44.860]  And he was like, that egg came out of that hole.
[26:44.860 --> 26:46.540]  That egg is about that size.
[26:46.540 --> 26:47.500]  Oh, look what I could do.
[26:47.500 --> 26:49.020]  It seems like a waste of chicken.
[26:49.020 --> 26:50.380]  He was all hungry when he was done.
[26:50.380 --> 26:51.820]  Did he eat it afterwards?
[26:51.820 --> 26:54.620]  That's what we asked, but he said no, that was gross.
[26:54.620 --> 26:56.860]  That's what's gross about that story.
[26:56.860 --> 26:57.360]  Yeah.
[26:59.340 --> 27:01.420]  He's an interesting character.
[27:02.380 --> 27:05.260]  All right, so Levin, who spoke to the Post by phone, said the church,
[27:05.260 --> 27:06.860]  yeah, this is from Indiana.
[27:07.660 --> 27:09.020]  Paul's part is from Mexico.
[27:09.580 --> 27:13.260]  Levin, who spoke to the Post by phone, said the church has received $2,000 in donations
[27:13.260 --> 27:18.700]  and received more than 7,000 Facebook fans in the five days that it has existed.
[27:18.700 --> 27:21.740]  He hopes to build the first church or temple built of hempcrete,
[27:21.740 --> 27:23.660]  a building material similar to concrete.
[27:23.660 --> 27:24.780]  That includes hemp.
[27:24.780 --> 27:25.340]  That's cool.
[27:25.340 --> 27:25.980]  That's going all out.
[27:25.980 --> 27:28.380]  I've heard a lot about hempcrete, and I think it's amazing.
[27:28.380 --> 27:29.020]  Yeah, it'll work.
[27:29.020 --> 27:30.620]  We need to start using this more.
[27:30.620 --> 27:34.140]  Yeah, and industrial hemp is a good idea, especially since we can now grow hemp in the
[27:34.140 --> 27:34.700]  United States.
[27:34.700 --> 27:39.180]  What are they doing, just taking rocks out and creating, putting hemp in instead of concrete?
[27:39.980 --> 27:43.500]  I don't know how they make concrete, so I don't want to sound stupid and try to act like I do.
[27:43.500 --> 27:44.940]  That's exactly how they do it.
[27:45.740 --> 27:46.220]  I don't know.
[27:46.220 --> 27:47.180]  I don't know either.
[27:47.180 --> 27:50.780]  I'm sure they're using some kind of chamomile as the powdery agent.
[27:52.540 --> 27:57.580]  It's apparently extremely fire resistant, so your houses won't burn down.
[27:57.580 --> 27:58.940]  And if it does, it'll smell real good.
[27:58.940 --> 27:59.820]  It'll smell really good.
[28:00.940 --> 28:04.220]  I like how we're too capable white men, and we don't know how to make concrete.
[28:04.780 --> 28:05.420]  We should know.
[28:05.420 --> 28:05.900]  You should know.
[28:05.900 --> 28:06.860]  You're a steel worker.
[28:06.860 --> 28:07.500]  I should know.
[28:07.500 --> 28:08.460]  I'm a little mad about it.
[28:08.460 --> 28:12.300]  I guess, yeah, like Ross DeFarian, all right, he might not know how to make concrete.
[28:12.300 --> 28:14.300]  That guy that makes rebar probably should know how to make concrete.
[28:14.300 --> 28:16.060]  That just seems like a hobby of yours.
[28:16.060 --> 28:17.420]  I'll make concrete on the side.
[28:17.420 --> 28:17.980]  Just fun.
[28:17.980 --> 28:19.180]  Whipping up a batch of crete.
[28:28.780 --> 28:29.900]  That's fantastic.
[28:31.180 --> 28:33.820]  Waiting for Adam Carolla to come over so we can hang some drywall.
[28:34.380 --> 28:37.100]  We're, he's, you know, we're looking at those joists.
[28:39.260 --> 28:39.660]  It is.
[28:39.660 --> 28:41.740]  Adam Carolla, fix your fucking eyebrows, bro.
[28:41.740 --> 28:42.860]  Oh, God.
[28:42.860 --> 28:44.700]  What do you think he has tattooed under there?
[28:44.700 --> 28:45.740]  Oh, man.
[28:45.740 --> 28:46.700]  You just grew them out.
[28:47.580 --> 28:48.780]  This is his love line.
[28:50.700 --> 28:51.740]  You know, I like, I like.
[28:51.740 --> 28:52.300]  1-800-LOVELINE?
[28:53.580 --> 28:58.780]  I like, I like that the thick eyebrows is in with girls today, because I love thick eyebrows.
[28:58.780 --> 29:00.700]  I hated the really thin, shallow eyebrows.
[29:00.700 --> 29:02.220]  We didn't just pencil them in real good.
[29:02.380 --> 29:03.900]  That's not a sharpie.
[29:03.900 --> 29:09.180]  You know, by the prettiness of the girls I'm looking at, like the eyebrows is not what I'm
[29:09.180 --> 29:09.500]  concentrating on.
[29:09.500 --> 29:11.260]  I know that's not what you're concentrating on.
[29:11.260 --> 29:12.620]  I like a nice face.
[29:12.620 --> 29:14.940]  If she doesn't have a mustache, Clint's excited.
[29:14.940 --> 29:15.260]  Yeah.
[29:15.900 --> 29:17.020]  Hey, you shaved your arms?
[29:17.020 --> 29:17.500]  Sweet.
[29:17.500 --> 29:18.700]  I'm okay with a mustache.
[29:18.700 --> 29:20.700]  As long as it, you know, I can grow a better one.
[29:20.700 --> 29:21.660]  Then it's okay.
[29:23.180 --> 29:24.460]  I'm going to read some more of this article.
[29:25.980 --> 29:26.940]  We are progressing.
[29:26.940 --> 29:28.700]  I don't, don't ever stop.
[29:28.700 --> 29:31.740]  I just want to get through this one article through the whole 45 minute show.
[29:31.820 --> 29:32.700]  I'll be happy with life.
[29:33.260 --> 29:36.620]  We're progressing to get a building property to be our holy ground.
[29:36.620 --> 29:39.340]  He said, we're going to set up counseling for heroin service.
[29:39.340 --> 29:41.580]  And we have a huge epidemic in this country.
[29:41.580 --> 29:43.500]  We'll probably have alcoholics anonymous too.
[29:43.500 --> 29:45.340]  I'm not going to allow alcohol on the premise.
[29:46.140 --> 29:52.780]  Levin also wrote out the new DD dozen 10 commandments, like a 10 commandments, like list
[29:52.780 --> 29:54.220]  with suggestions for better living.
[29:54.220 --> 29:54.460]  Sorry.
[29:54.460 --> 29:57.980]  I'm laughing at this article and you guys, while I'm trying to read the Bibles of other
[29:57.980 --> 30:03.340]  religious religions are yesteryear about the drinking out of goat skins.
[30:03.340 --> 30:05.180]  What about drinking out of goat skins?
[30:05.180 --> 30:09.580]  That doesn't relate to the people with GPS in their hand and 7,000 tunes in that same
[30:09.580 --> 30:09.820]  hand.
[30:09.820 --> 30:11.660]  He said, the church is very simple.
[30:11.660 --> 30:14.940]  The first good book we're going to ask practitioners to read and understand is the
[30:14.940 --> 30:16.220]  emperor wears no clothes.
[30:17.100 --> 30:20.540]  So it kind of feels to me like this guy's copying that church on weeds.
[30:20.540 --> 30:22.060]  Remember that church on weeds?
[30:22.060 --> 30:23.100]  Oh, I didn't watch weeds.
[30:23.100 --> 30:24.300]  I watched a TV show.
[30:24.300 --> 30:24.460]  Yeah.
[30:25.820 --> 30:27.020]  That's a good TV show.
[30:27.020 --> 30:27.500]  It was good.
[30:27.580 --> 30:31.900]  Well, remember that up until Nancy got shot and then I was like, Oh, spoiler alert.
[30:31.900 --> 30:32.060]  Yeah.
[30:32.620 --> 30:36.540]  If you haven't fucking watched that by now, I'm going to spoil the whole thing.
[30:36.540 --> 30:39.500]  The last episode of weeds definitely made me tear up though.
[30:39.500 --> 30:42.700]  That was a really good season finale or series finale.
[30:42.700 --> 30:43.980]  I don't remember that part.
[30:43.980 --> 30:44.780]  That's really good.
[30:44.780 --> 30:45.020]  All right.
[30:45.020 --> 30:45.660]  More article.
[30:45.660 --> 30:46.780]  He says, I'm very faith driven.
[30:46.780 --> 30:48.380]  I'm very spiritual and I'm filled with love.
[30:48.380 --> 30:52.380]  He said, I find that most religions are misled into gross perversions of what they are meant
[30:52.380 --> 30:52.860]  to be.
[30:52.860 --> 30:56.460]  This path has led me to lead a religion that people in today's world can relate to.
[30:56.460 --> 30:58.540]  We don't have any guilt doctrine built in.
[30:58.540 --> 30:59.900]  We don't have any sins built in.
[31:00.540 --> 31:05.580]  Once the church is established, members will be asked for individual donations of $4.20
[31:05.580 --> 31:05.820]  a month.
[31:05.820 --> 31:11.420]  He said, Indiana attorney and political commentator Abdul Hakeem Shabazz wrote the Indiana legislators
[31:11.420 --> 31:15.900]  may have put the state in a position to acknowledge those who profess to smoke pot as a religious
[31:15.900 --> 31:16.940]  sacrament.
[31:16.940 --> 31:21.100]  You see, if I would argue that under RFA, as long as you can show that reefer is part
[31:21.100 --> 31:24.780]  of your religious practices, you got a pretty good shot of getting off scot-free.
[31:24.780 --> 31:30.060]  He wrote, remember under RFRA, the state has to articulate a compelling interest in
[31:30.060 --> 31:31.660]  preventing you from smoking pot.
[31:32.540 --> 31:33.980]  I argue they can't.
[31:33.980 --> 31:39.580]  The church of cannabis is just one test in many under Indiana's new law, which has escalated
[31:39.580 --> 31:44.140]  a national prominence in the past week, raising questions about the future of religious freedom
[31:44.140 --> 31:45.980]  laws and gay rights.
[31:45.980 --> 31:47.260]  So I should recap a little bit.
[31:47.980 --> 31:53.980]  The reason that this is popping up is because in Indiana, they just tried to do some rude
[31:53.980 --> 31:56.860]  shit to gay people, citing the Bible as their reasoning.
[31:57.580 --> 32:01.500]  And then these people said, well, if you're going to cite the Bible for saying the Bible
[32:01.500 --> 32:04.620]  says, I don't even want to get into the Bible.
[32:04.620 --> 32:08.700]  Some folks interpretation of the Bible says that homosexuality is wrong.
[32:08.700 --> 32:11.420]  I'm not going to say if I agree or disagree, I'm going to say that that's what that one
[32:11.420 --> 32:13.100]  book says and what people have read.
[32:13.100 --> 32:17.180]  So since that is a thing, we're also saying that in that same book, they've said that
[32:17.180 --> 32:19.420]  all these herbs are here for us to smoke.
[32:19.420 --> 32:20.940]  We're playing by these rules on the gay thing.
[32:20.940 --> 32:22.540]  We're playing by these rules on the pot thing.
[32:22.540 --> 32:23.340]  Ha ha, we win.
[32:23.340 --> 32:25.100]  That's kind of what this church is trying to do.
[32:25.100 --> 32:25.740]  Sick.
[32:25.740 --> 32:25.980]  Yeah.
[32:25.980 --> 32:27.340]  So I think that's kind of cool.
[32:27.340 --> 32:28.140]  With two Qs.
[32:29.020 --> 32:29.340]  Sick.
[32:30.140 --> 32:30.780]  Gnarly, bro.
[32:30.780 --> 32:32.060]  Smoked some weed in church.
[32:32.060 --> 32:38.620]  I want to see a Letterman top 10 of his, uh, of like his, uh, do's and don'ts.
[32:38.620 --> 32:41.980]  Like number one, thou shalt not spill the bong water.
[32:41.980 --> 32:42.860]  Thou shalt not.
[32:42.860 --> 32:43.580]  Okay.
[32:43.580 --> 32:50.540]  I hate when people use the old Testament as their sort of, you know, guide to hating on
[32:50.540 --> 32:54.140]  gays and hating on anything because that's where all the anti-gay stuff comes from.
[32:54.140 --> 32:55.340]  It doesn't come from the New Testament.
[32:55.340 --> 32:55.580]  Yeah.
[32:55.580 --> 32:56.940]  Well, it's all about the cleanliness.
[32:56.940 --> 33:04.060]  And the reason why, um, a lot of, uh, people think that they're, they're, they put the,
[33:04.060 --> 33:06.860]  the anti-gay thing in the old Testament was you're living in a desert.
[33:06.860 --> 33:08.940]  You're living around people who are all trying to kill you.
[33:08.940 --> 33:11.100]  So every baby counts at that point.
[33:11.100 --> 33:11.340]  Yeah.
[33:11.340 --> 33:14.140]  The old Testament is just a guide in how to survive in the desert.
[33:14.140 --> 33:17.500]  And some religions say that you're not supposed to jerk off because you don't want to waste
[33:17.500 --> 33:17.900]  sperm.
[33:17.900 --> 33:18.300]  Exactly.
[33:18.300 --> 33:22.300]  Like that could have been re, uh, carrying on our religion and our race.
[33:22.300 --> 33:24.940]  It's, it's continuing on our people so we can continue to exist.
[33:24.940 --> 33:25.100]  Yeah.
[33:25.100 --> 33:26.380]  A fucking sinner.
[33:26.380 --> 33:28.940]  You're not going to get that chicken pregnant and keep our religion going.
[33:28.940 --> 33:31.740]  We're not, we're not, we're not living in a desert around.
[33:31.740 --> 33:32.460]  Is that Pukaki?
[33:34.060 --> 33:37.500]  We're not living in a desert around a bunch of hostile barbarians who are trying to kill us.
[33:37.500 --> 33:38.300]  We kind of are.
[33:39.260 --> 33:40.220]  In some ways.
[33:40.220 --> 33:41.020]  Yes, I guess.
[33:41.020 --> 33:43.980]  We kind of are just in a little bit different sense than back in the day.
[33:43.980 --> 33:44.300]  Yeah.
[33:44.300 --> 33:49.260]  Well, the world's grossly overpopulated, so you can, you can have sex with a guy if you want.
[33:50.540 --> 33:52.860]  I think you should, you know, do it.
[33:52.860 --> 33:53.420]  Yeah.
[33:53.420 --> 33:55.500]  If you want to do that, go for it.
[33:55.500 --> 33:56.620]  I'm not going to stop you.
[33:56.620 --> 33:57.660]  It's not my business.
[33:57.660 --> 33:59.660]  I've never tried, but I'm open.
[33:59.660 --> 34:03.340]  If, uh, if there's a handsome young guy who wants to take me on a date and Paul,
[34:03.340 --> 34:05.500]  you've put yourself out here a lot on the show.
[34:05.500 --> 34:07.180]  You've hoarded yourself out to the max.
[34:07.180 --> 34:08.460]  Come to my comedy show.
[34:08.460 --> 34:09.740]  My ex girlfriends come fuck me.
[34:09.740 --> 34:11.740]  New girlfriends come fuck me and dudes.
[34:11.740 --> 34:13.740]  I'm getting anyone, you know?
[34:14.300 --> 34:15.900]  I'm just getting weird with life now.
[34:15.900 --> 34:16.700]  Fuck sounds good.
[34:16.700 --> 34:17.420]  Live a little, right?
[34:17.420 --> 34:18.140]  Figured it out.
[34:18.140 --> 34:19.740]  Live a little secret to life.
[34:19.740 --> 34:21.180]  Live a little secret to the life.
[34:22.460 --> 34:22.780]  All right.
[34:23.500 --> 34:23.580]  Yeah.
[34:23.580 --> 34:24.620]  I don't know, man.
[34:24.620 --> 34:29.660]  If, if that's something that I don't, I guess I don't feel like it's, uh, like weed sacramental
[34:29.660 --> 34:32.940]  to me, but it's just kind of like a hangout thing to do.
[34:32.940 --> 34:34.780]  I don't even do it every day.
[34:34.780 --> 34:35.180]  Yeah.
[34:35.180 --> 34:35.420]  Yeah.
[34:35.420 --> 34:40.620]  I would much rather go and hang out with somebody, but are you a religious or a spiritual person?
[34:40.620 --> 34:41.180]  Otherwise?
[34:41.180 --> 34:41.660]  No.
[34:41.660 --> 34:42.300]  Okay.
[34:42.300 --> 34:42.540]  No.
[34:42.540 --> 34:47.980]  Do you think it's kind of a way, do you think it's kind of a way for people to just smoke pot
[34:47.980 --> 34:49.740]  and kind of abuse it in that sense?
[34:49.740 --> 34:50.300]  Absolutely.
[34:50.300 --> 34:52.700]  I think, uh, there are a lot of people.
[34:53.820 --> 34:54.380]  I do it.
[34:54.380 --> 34:55.180]  I do it.
[34:55.180 --> 34:57.340]  My first dab is medical.
[34:57.340 --> 34:59.020]  That first stab makes my shoulders not hurt.
[34:59.020 --> 35:01.500]  Did I knock myself clean the fuck out a few days ago?
[35:01.500 --> 35:04.620]  Like clean out and the first stab makes that not hurt.
[35:05.340 --> 35:07.980]  Second dab makes me good and high third dab.
[35:07.980 --> 35:09.500]  And I'm just dabbed and having fun.
[35:09.500 --> 35:13.100]  The fourth and fifth dab, that is just me abusing it because I've got a lot of dabs
[35:13.100 --> 35:15.100]  and I like to see how high we can get today.
[35:15.100 --> 35:15.660]  Yeah.
[35:15.660 --> 35:19.820]  But in the morning when I'm here by myself and I need some thinking to do, and I got to clear my
[35:19.820 --> 35:24.060]  head and I got a lot of shit on my mind and the world's going too fast for me to get away from it
[35:24.060 --> 35:24.620]  all.
[35:24.620 --> 35:28.060]  Uh, turn off all the lights, turn off the TV, turn off the phone, turn off the computer,
[35:28.060 --> 35:33.420]  get as silent as I can, roll up a big fat spliff of just flowers, just buds, buds that I grew,
[35:34.060 --> 35:37.420]  uh, my own personal hidden away, but that nobody else has access to.
[35:37.420 --> 35:42.380]  Nobody gets to see, roll that up, smoke a big fatty middle finger size joint by myself
[35:43.020 --> 35:46.940]  and close my eyes and just see what I am really thinking.
[35:46.940 --> 35:51.180]  Because sometimes my head's just going too fast to even really hear what I'm thinking.
[35:51.820 --> 35:55.580]  And when I get nice and blazed and just close my eyes and just shut up for a minute and get
[35:55.580 --> 36:00.060]  into that quiet space, oh, that's, that's the truth.
[36:00.060 --> 36:03.420]  It's not, I didn't really, I'm not mad about some Facebook shit.
[36:03.420 --> 36:04.460]  Facebook doesn't matter.
[36:04.460 --> 36:08.700]  Once you close your eyes and go into that bubble, whatever she said on Facebook, doesn't
[36:08.700 --> 36:08.940]  matter.
[36:08.940 --> 36:11.100]  That guy talking shit about your Instagram picture.
[36:11.100 --> 36:11.980]  You don't really care.
[36:12.780 --> 36:14.700]  You're missing your favorite TV show.
[36:14.700 --> 36:19.580]  Oh, well, you realize like what's inside and it just kind of, it shows me more what I really
[36:19.580 --> 36:20.620]  need to pay attention to.
[36:20.620 --> 36:22.220]  And it kind of calms me down a little bit.
[36:22.220 --> 36:25.660]  See, I felt like I had the opposite thing for me, especially since I haven't been smoking
[36:25.660 --> 36:31.020]  pot and smoking anything or doing anything really for the past like 40 days and 50 days,
[36:31.020 --> 36:34.780]  however many days it's been is, uh, I was definitely abusing it.
[36:34.780 --> 36:39.660]  I smoked too much needlessly just to smoke it, just to see how high I could get.
[36:39.660 --> 36:42.540]  Like you're saying, and, uh, I'm going to take a dab right now.
[36:42.540 --> 36:46.780]  It wouldn't, it wouldn't necessarily like clear my mind or help me think straight or
[36:46.780 --> 36:47.100]  anything.
[36:47.100 --> 36:52.300]  It would kind of just make me think in worse ways because I was always second guessing
[36:52.300 --> 36:55.820]  myself and I was just overthinking things and then my brain wouldn't shut off because
[36:55.820 --> 36:56.380]  of it.
[36:56.380 --> 37:00.140]  So now that I've, I haven't been smoking, I felt like it's greatly improved like my writing
[37:00.140 --> 37:04.940]  and just my, my overall sense of being, that was something I wanted to touch on.
[37:04.940 --> 37:06.540]  Uh, kind of changed the vibe a little bit.
[37:07.180 --> 37:09.740]  Uh, I know Clint's kind of a, I'm gonna call you a lightweight bro.
[37:09.740 --> 37:12.540]  He used to smoke weed like a little girl, but you're a cheap date.
[37:12.540 --> 37:13.100]  So I love it.
[37:13.100 --> 37:14.300]  He's a big man too.
[37:14.300 --> 37:14.540]  Yeah.
[37:14.540 --> 37:16.220]  He's also bring my own weed.
[37:16.220 --> 37:18.860]  So it's not even like imposing on anybody else.
[37:18.860 --> 37:21.500]  It's like he showed up with, I smoked your weed and it was tasty.
[37:21.500 --> 37:23.340]  That's some pretty tasty, a Bubba Kush.
[37:23.340 --> 37:24.060]  It didn't taste bad.
[37:24.060 --> 37:27.020]  It didn't make my mouth burn and it got me stoned as good weed.
[37:27.020 --> 37:27.500]  Good.
[37:27.500 --> 37:30.220]  Uh, he came over and he took one rip off of a pipe.
[37:30.220 --> 37:35.980]  So when you write some comedy, do you like write it when you're straight and then embellish
[37:35.980 --> 37:38.620]  it when you get lit or how does smoking affect your writing?
[37:38.620 --> 37:39.660]  Where does it come into play?
[37:39.660 --> 37:44.540]  No, there's, it's kind of like, uh, there's two Clint's in that aspect cause there's stone
[37:44.540 --> 37:49.900]  Clinton and then there's sober Clint's and, uh, and never the two shall meet.
[37:49.900 --> 37:54.780]  But, um, no, they, uh, stone Clint can write some shit.
[37:54.780 --> 38:00.060]  It's fucking some of the shit that comes out that I find in my phone when I sober up
[38:00.060 --> 38:02.380]  is what the fuck was I thinking?
[38:03.020 --> 38:04.700]  Like, this is so weird.
[38:05.420 --> 38:09.500]  And then I see, and I remember what I was trying to do with it, but there's no way I
[38:09.500 --> 38:11.340]  would have ever written that sober.
[38:11.340 --> 38:11.900]  Okay.
[38:11.900 --> 38:17.100]  And, and I, you know, I've, I, I write a lot and in this last month I haven't written a
[38:17.100 --> 38:17.580]  whole lot.
[38:17.580 --> 38:20.140]  I just been taking some time away from comedy.
[38:21.100 --> 38:26.700]  Just to clear my head, trying to get my medications straight, you know, cause I'm on a couple
[38:26.700 --> 38:32.060]  of like antidepressants cause old happy Clint wasn't super happy here recently.
[38:32.060 --> 38:35.660]  So I'm doing group therapy and then seeing a one-on-one.
[38:36.220 --> 38:36.620]  Are you?
[38:36.620 --> 38:36.860]  Yeah.
[38:36.860 --> 38:38.220]  I've been seeing a therapist too.
[38:38.220 --> 38:40.860]  And it's, that's like my favorite time of the week.
[38:40.860 --> 38:41.100]  Yeah.
[38:41.100 --> 38:45.260]  Like I go talk with the dude for like an hour and he's just like, dude, I got your back.
[38:45.260 --> 38:46.620]  I don't care what you say.
[38:46.700 --> 38:50.860]  Like, and I don't do anything that's terrible, but I don't do anything or I don't feel like
[38:50.860 --> 38:52.140]  I'm doing good enough.
[38:52.140 --> 38:55.820]  Anyway, what I was getting at is like, oh, I, I feel both ways.
[38:55.820 --> 38:57.340]  I'll get real introspective.
[38:57.340 --> 38:58.220]  Like you do Jeff.
[38:58.220 --> 39:00.540]  And like, what, what is the problem that I'm feeling?
[39:00.540 --> 39:02.380]  And then deal with it right in that moment.
[39:03.020 --> 39:08.380]  But I've also gotten the way that Paul gets and where it's like, all right, why is that
[39:08.380 --> 39:09.500]  making me feel this way?
[39:09.500 --> 39:10.300]  It's because of this.
[39:10.300 --> 39:11.340]  It's because of this.
[39:11.340 --> 39:16.940]  I need to like quit doing everything that I do wrong and only work because I got a 13
[39:16.940 --> 39:20.060]  year old daughter and I'm afraid she's not going to get to college because she wants
[39:20.060 --> 39:20.780]  to be a surgeon.
[39:20.780 --> 39:23.580]  Then I start dwelling on that and that freaks me out.
[39:23.580 --> 39:24.140]  Yeah.
[39:24.140 --> 39:30.220]  So, but I get like the super happy way to like, you know, this joke that I wrote and
[39:30.220 --> 39:33.980]  maybe it's a little bit long, but you go and edit it when you're sober and it's great.
[39:33.980 --> 39:37.820]  And then you tell it when you're so I only, I don't like getting up in front of people
[39:37.820 --> 39:43.980]  stoned because I feel like that's my time to, to be on point.
[39:43.980 --> 39:44.220]  Yeah.
[39:44.220 --> 39:44.860]  Oh yeah, for sure.
[39:44.860 --> 39:46.620]  When you're on the spotlight, you need to be on the spotlight.
[39:46.620 --> 39:52.220]  I used to do a lot of mic time high and now that I'm not high, it's, I've, it's so much
[39:52.220 --> 39:53.260]  better for me.
[39:53.260 --> 39:56.940]  I feel, and Doug Benson, bro, I love you, but I'm going to say this out loud.
[39:56.940 --> 40:01.020]  I feel Doug Benson being so high really squishes his comedy.
[40:01.020 --> 40:03.820]  He could be a better performer if he weren't so high.
[40:03.820 --> 40:04.220]  Yeah.
[40:04.220 --> 40:05.020]  Like I could see it.
[40:05.020 --> 40:05.660]  It slows him down.
[40:05.660 --> 40:06.380]  I've seen him forget.
[40:06.940 --> 40:12.460]  I personally have gotten Doug Benson so high before a show that he's just flubbed it complete
[40:12.460 --> 40:16.060]  bits and looked at me and said, Ross to Jeff, you got me way too high.
[40:16.620 --> 40:18.860]  Like he told me on stage that I got him too high.
[40:18.860 --> 40:19.420]  Yeah.
[40:19.420 --> 40:23.340]  Like that's, you'd never see a lot of other comedians.
[40:23.340 --> 40:24.700]  You wouldn't see Bill Cosby doing that.
[40:24.700 --> 40:25.340]  I'll tell you that much.
[40:25.340 --> 40:29.180]  Well, I like the silence that you just brought to the show.
[40:29.180 --> 40:29.980]  I dropped it.
[40:29.980 --> 40:30.380]  I don't know.
[40:30.860 --> 40:33.420]  It's like picking on Bill Cosby is like picking on Michael Jackson.
[40:34.380 --> 40:35.580]  The people have chosen sides.
[40:35.580 --> 40:38.380]  And if you fucking decide which side you're on publicly, then the other side hates you.
[40:38.380 --> 40:39.660]  And I'm just going to stay impartial.
[40:39.660 --> 40:40.220]  I don't care.
[40:40.940 --> 40:41.580]  No, either do I.
[40:41.580 --> 40:42.220]  They're not going to.
[40:42.220 --> 40:43.260]  You got to do what you got to do.
[40:43.260 --> 40:45.420]  They're not going to hate me for hating a rapist.
[40:45.420 --> 40:45.740]  Right.
[40:45.740 --> 40:49.740]  Hey, if him sexually abusing me gets me a TV spot, I'm there.
[40:50.620 --> 40:51.100]  That's just me.
[40:51.100 --> 40:51.820]  You'll need a couple of pills.
[40:51.820 --> 40:53.020]  You don't even need to eat the pills, right?
[40:53.020 --> 40:53.260]  Yeah.
[40:53.260 --> 40:54.540]  A lot of people are going to hate me for that one.
[40:56.300 --> 40:58.140]  Hey, April 7th, what's up?
[40:58.140 --> 40:59.820]  April 7th, come see comedy.
[40:59.820 --> 41:00.060]  Yeah.
[41:00.060 --> 41:00.780]  Come see comedy.
[41:00.780 --> 41:01.260]  Yeah.
[41:01.260 --> 41:01.980]  I'm on there.
[41:02.220 --> 41:03.980]  And, uh, but don't come for me.
[41:03.980 --> 41:05.660]  Come for Mary Mac and her husband.
[41:05.660 --> 41:06.700]  They're really funny people.
[41:06.700 --> 41:07.180]  Yeah.
[41:07.180 --> 41:08.300]  We'll come for you too.
[41:08.300 --> 41:09.500]  His name is big.
[41:09.500 --> 41:10.220]  His name is big.
[41:10.220 --> 41:11.180]  Does he have a lot of words?
[41:11.180 --> 41:11.980]  A lot of letters in it.
[41:11.980 --> 41:12.540]  Big Mac.
[41:12.540 --> 41:13.100]  It's Tim.
[41:13.660 --> 41:14.940]  Tim something.
[41:14.940 --> 41:16.620]  They don't, they don't share the same last name.
[41:16.620 --> 41:18.140]  It's probably for entertainment reasons.
[41:19.660 --> 41:20.380]  I don't know, buddy.
[41:20.380 --> 41:22.940]  I don't know about all that change in your name stuff.
[41:22.940 --> 41:23.420]  Yeah.
[41:23.420 --> 41:24.220]  Go with your real name.
[41:24.220 --> 41:27.340]  I had a lot more to ask about that, but we got thrown off track and I have no idea what
[41:27.340 --> 41:28.140]  the fuck he was going to say.
[41:28.140 --> 41:28.780]  I got excited.
[41:28.780 --> 41:30.780]  No, I think we were talking about when we were writing.
[41:30.780 --> 41:31.260]  Yeah.
[41:31.260 --> 41:31.580]  Yeah.
[41:31.980 --> 41:35.020]  And, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's both ways though.
[41:35.020 --> 41:39.900]  Like I can be stoned and right, but it, my inspiration just comes from like the weirdest
[41:39.900 --> 41:40.140]  shit.
[41:41.020 --> 41:44.940]  Just man, like watching an infomercial and it's like, what the fuck?
[41:45.740 --> 41:49.580]  Why am I thinking about like this different way to watch YouTube all of a sudden?
[41:49.580 --> 41:49.980]  Yeah.
[41:49.980 --> 41:54.860]  Like, yeah, it's, that's where that's, that's kind of how I started out with just like trying
[41:54.860 --> 41:59.820]  to write comedy about funny situations or just like little things that I think of.
[41:59.820 --> 42:01.100]  And I can't do that anymore.
[42:01.100 --> 42:04.780]  Now I have to, it's all written about my personal experiences and about like my personal
[42:04.780 --> 42:05.900]  feelings and stuff.
[42:05.900 --> 42:06.540]  Keeps it better.
[42:06.540 --> 42:09.980]  I think when you're telling like, listen to any artist that's written an album about
[42:09.980 --> 42:10.940]  themselves, it was real.
[42:10.940 --> 42:14.540]  That first album that most people come out with, it's their real life experience.
[42:14.540 --> 42:14.940]  Right.
[42:14.940 --> 42:19.260]  That second and third album, it's studio pressure and they ran out of life experience because
[42:19.260 --> 42:23.180]  now they're just being a musician or that, or they really took something from that experience
[42:23.180 --> 42:23.980]  and they made another one.
[42:23.980 --> 42:27.820]  But a lot of times, and I'm not trying to say that Montesiyahu's first album, live at
[42:27.820 --> 42:31.580]  Stubbs, he's where he blew his load, but you can tell he spent his whole life writing
[42:31.580 --> 42:31.740]  that.
[42:31.740 --> 42:33.900]  And then after that, he's like, Oh, I have to make another album.
[42:33.900 --> 42:34.140]  Shit.
[42:35.420 --> 42:35.820]  Yeah.
[42:35.820 --> 42:38.380]  Well, I feel that way about comedy too.
[42:38.380 --> 42:42.700]  Like you'll see some guys that like their first, like their first comedy special was
[42:42.700 --> 42:44.780]  like, Whoa, that's cool.
[42:44.780 --> 42:49.180]  And you knew that they had worked like 12 years to get that, just that one hour, 30
[42:49.180 --> 42:50.300]  minutes, 30 minutes.
[42:50.300 --> 42:56.780]  Well, even like they're like, uh, the first time I saw Dane Cook was, um, I tried so hard
[42:56.780 --> 42:57.820]  not to bring him into this.
[42:57.820 --> 43:02.780]  Well, I mean, he was funny back in the day, back when we were in, in high school and middle
[43:02.780 --> 43:07.500]  school, he was the guy and, and you can't take that away from him for a minute.
[43:07.500 --> 43:13.020]  And I know people say, Oh, he stole jokes from people, but 90% of our garden, dude,
[43:13.020 --> 43:13.820]  I don't know, man.
[43:13.820 --> 43:16.460]  You know, he's yeah, he sold out Madison square garden.
[43:16.460 --> 43:20.060]  So he made comedy blow up.
[43:20.060 --> 43:25.980]  We're still writing his coattails because of him is why like premium blend had him on.
[43:26.620 --> 43:33.340]  And I don't remember a lot of sets other than like him, but you you'll see like he blew
[43:33.340 --> 43:35.580]  up and now we're all riding that coattails.
[43:35.580 --> 43:37.260]  And I don't remember what my point was now.
[43:37.820 --> 43:38.780]  So that's fun.
[43:39.340 --> 43:43.340]  No, but like his first album, that's what I mean is like his first, like 15 minutes
[43:43.340 --> 43:44.300]  it was like, Oh shit.
[43:44.860 --> 43:48.860]  And now you see him and he's not as funny as like going through the motions.
[43:49.660 --> 43:51.180]  I watched his last special.
[43:51.180 --> 43:54.860]  It was hard to watch, but I could still go back and watch his first special.
[43:54.860 --> 43:55.900]  We're talking about comedy.
[43:55.900 --> 44:00.220]  One of the best comedy specials I've seen in a long time is the bill Burr special.
[44:00.220 --> 44:01.180]  That's in black and white.
[44:02.860 --> 44:03.980]  I haven't, I haven't seen it.
[44:03.980 --> 44:04.540]  Watch that one.
[44:05.660 --> 44:07.100]  And you guys, sorry, you feel that way?
[44:08.060 --> 44:12.300]  No, that's the name of the, I was like, what, dude, since we're on this, we're not even
[44:12.300 --> 44:13.180]  talking about weed today, guys.
[44:13.180 --> 44:14.540]  We're going to talk a little bit more about comedy.
[44:14.540 --> 44:15.900]  We did something we've been watching.
[44:17.100 --> 44:17.260]  Yeah.
[44:17.260 --> 44:20.460]  We're going to, I'm going to talk about Rostan stuff for a second too, on that we've been
[44:20.460 --> 44:21.100]  watching.
[44:21.100 --> 44:23.900]  This is not happening with Ari Shafir on YouTube.
[44:23.900 --> 44:25.660]  I've watched like all 50 something episodes.
[44:25.660 --> 44:27.500]  You guys check that out.
[44:27.500 --> 44:27.740]  Really?
[44:27.740 --> 44:28.460]  This is not happening.
[44:28.460 --> 44:29.100]  Really funny.
[44:29.100 --> 44:29.340]  Yeah.
[44:29.340 --> 44:30.220]  It's all of it's on YouTube.
[44:30.220 --> 44:32.460]  Go, go to the comedy central YouTube channel.
[44:32.460 --> 44:33.180]  There's a playlist.
[44:33.180 --> 44:35.340]  Just go to number one and click play and watch them all.
[44:36.220 --> 44:37.980]  Joey Diaz's are the best.
[44:37.980 --> 44:40.140]  Joey Diaz is one of my favorite comedians ever.
[44:40.780 --> 44:42.700]  Joe Rogan does a couple of great ones on there.
[44:43.420 --> 44:46.140]  Big Jay Oakerson will make you pee your pants laughing.
[44:46.140 --> 44:48.540]  I thought Kyle Kinane's was really Kyle Kinane is good.
[44:48.540 --> 44:49.580]  Big Kyle Kinane fan.
[44:50.380 --> 44:52.060]  Who's the guy that got in the fight in a phone booth?
[44:52.700 --> 44:53.580]  I don't remember.
[44:54.300 --> 44:54.860]  Find that one.
[44:54.860 --> 44:55.420]  Clint's mother.
[44:56.540 --> 44:57.660]  Clint's mom's on the show.
[44:57.660 --> 44:58.140]  She won.
[44:59.740 --> 45:00.460]  She won that fight.
[45:00.460 --> 45:01.660]  She won the fight in the phone booth.
[45:01.660 --> 45:04.700]  Since we're talking about comedy, I brought up the event page so I can give everybody the
[45:04.700 --> 45:05.740]  full spiel.
[45:05.740 --> 45:11.180]  Mary Mac has been on Comedy Central's Live at Gotham, NBC's Last Comic Standing, Montreal's
[45:11.180 --> 45:16.140]  Just for Laughs Festival on the San Francisco Sketch Fest, and her husband Tim Harmston has
[45:16.140 --> 45:17.500]  been on Letterman.
[45:17.500 --> 45:18.220]  Oh wow.
[45:18.220 --> 45:20.300]  We're going to have people that have been on TV.
[45:20.300 --> 45:22.860]  Yeah, they're actual people who have done stuff before.
[45:24.300 --> 45:27.420]  April 7th, Tuesday, The Rainbow at 9pm for $5.
[45:28.060 --> 45:30.540]  Pueblo, you're really missing out if you don't go to this one.
[45:30.540 --> 45:31.740]  Yeah, come on down, you guys.
[45:31.740 --> 45:32.860]  There's a good chance I'll be there.
[45:33.740 --> 45:34.940]  It's on Santa Fe.
[45:34.940 --> 45:36.620]  It's right near the Green Light Tavern.
[45:36.620 --> 45:38.300]  Right up the street from the Green Light.
[45:38.300 --> 45:38.540]  Cool.
[45:38.540 --> 45:41.420]  Just go check it out and have some laughs, get some drinks.
[45:41.420 --> 45:42.780]  It's a really cool bar.
[45:42.780 --> 45:44.940]  Come eat, Paul, because we've really described him in a weird way.
[45:44.940 --> 45:47.980]  He's got a Hitler mustache and a teardrop tattoo from our description.
[45:47.980 --> 45:49.900]  I have Thug Life tattooed on my eyebrows.
[45:49.900 --> 45:50.780]  Yeah.
[45:50.780 --> 45:53.020]  Desperate, desperate for companionship.
[45:53.020 --> 45:53.980]  Yeah, he's thrown that out there.
[45:53.980 --> 45:55.420]  I was going to remind everybody of that.
[45:55.420 --> 45:56.860]  Extremely desperate.
[45:56.860 --> 45:58.380]  He needs a hug.
[45:58.380 --> 45:59.660]  That's really what he needs.
[45:59.660 --> 46:00.540]  A mouth hug.
[46:00.540 --> 46:01.180]  A mouth hug.
[46:01.180 --> 46:01.900]  A penis.
[46:04.300 --> 46:07.660]  No matter what you try to do with these boys, it always goes back to a dick joke.
[46:07.660 --> 46:08.860]  I don't give a fuck.
[46:10.220 --> 46:11.260]  We're not comedians.
[46:11.260 --> 46:12.140]  That's the thing.
[46:12.140 --> 46:13.420]  We're open micers.
[46:13.420 --> 46:13.740]  Yep.
[46:13.740 --> 46:15.340]  It's all about the mentality, bro.
[46:15.340 --> 46:18.700]  Well, I mean, we treat it serious, but we're not getting paid for this.
[46:18.700 --> 46:18.940]  Yeah.
[46:19.500 --> 46:22.540]  Even all that money that Paul's bringing in, like, yeah, $5 donation.
[46:22.540 --> 46:23.660]  That's not going to Paul.
[46:23.660 --> 46:25.100]  Paul ain't making shit on this show.
[46:25.100 --> 46:27.100]  I'm not getting paid at all for this show.
[46:27.100 --> 46:29.740]  Buying pizza and beer for the comedians pretty much.
[46:29.740 --> 46:34.940]  Well, we actually get sponsored by Paul's Pizza in Cannolis in Pueblo, which if you
[46:34.940 --> 46:38.140]  haven't had Paul's Pizza, you should definitely go try it.
[46:38.140 --> 46:40.540]  It's on Norwood, where the Taco Casa is.
[46:40.540 --> 46:41.180]  It's really good.
[46:41.180 --> 46:47.420]  They have, like, two topping to, like, large pizzas for, like, $12.
[46:47.420 --> 46:48.860]  It's really, really good.
[46:48.860 --> 46:49.740]  Guess how fat he is.
[46:49.740 --> 46:52.140]  If he knows the pizza specials, guys, you get to guess his weight.
[46:52.140 --> 46:53.340]  They're my sponsor.
[46:53.340 --> 46:54.380]  Guess his weight on Twitter.
[46:54.380 --> 46:56.540]  I know it because I tell people.
[46:56.540 --> 46:57.740]  Guess his weight on Twitter.
[46:57.740 --> 46:59.340]  And I'm a big fan of pizza.
[46:59.340 --> 47:01.660]  Hashtag 257.
[47:01.660 --> 47:05.020]  That's, like, what stops me from committing suicide is, like, well, you're going to eat
[47:05.020 --> 47:07.740]  pizza again, so just make it through tonight.
[47:07.740 --> 47:10.300]  Did you watch, did you listen to that Pete Holmes?
[47:10.300 --> 47:12.220]  Did you listen to You Made It Weird?
[47:12.220 --> 47:13.100]  It's too long.
[47:13.820 --> 47:15.020]  And I can't live.
[47:15.020 --> 47:18.300]  He had Henry Rollins on, and he goes, Henry, why do you want people to live longer?
[47:18.300 --> 47:20.300]  And he goes, two words, more pizza.
[47:20.620 --> 47:22.860]  Henry Rollins is a smart guy.
[47:22.860 --> 47:25.660]  I hated Henry Rollins until I read his book, Get in the Van.
[47:25.660 --> 47:27.820]  I have so much respect for that guy after reading that.
[47:27.820 --> 47:28.060]  Nice.
[47:28.060 --> 47:28.620]  Put in some work.
[47:29.100 --> 47:29.500]  Yeah.
[47:29.500 --> 47:30.780]  Created the DC scene.
[47:31.740 --> 47:35.420]  He was part of the DC scene, and then, you know, created the LA scene with SST Records
[47:35.420 --> 47:36.300]  and Black Flag.
[47:36.300 --> 47:36.940]  That's crazy.
[47:36.940 --> 47:39.580]  Oh, man, you guys should just do a punk rock podcast or some sort of.
[47:39.580 --> 47:40.540]  I love punk rock.
[47:40.540 --> 47:41.500]  Yeah, well, there you go.
[47:41.500 --> 47:42.540]  We'll do a whole episode.
[47:42.540 --> 47:45.660]  Not this show, but we're going to do another podcast, which is called Punk Rock.
[47:45.660 --> 47:46.940]  We'll do one episode.
[47:46.940 --> 47:47.500]  I'm down.
[47:47.500 --> 47:48.460]  It'll go away.
[47:48.460 --> 47:49.020]  Yeah.
[47:49.020 --> 47:51.020]  Like three minutes long, we'll just yell like a sweet.
[47:51.020 --> 47:54.300]  Oh, it'll just be a punk rock song of a podcast.
[47:55.020 --> 47:56.620]  My favorite band is Black Flag.
[47:56.620 --> 47:58.780]  And then you scream something obnoxious, too.
[47:58.780 --> 48:01.500]  And then we'll punch each other and drink a beer, and then it'll be the end of the show.
[48:01.500 --> 48:03.660]  Yeah, sounds like a good show.
[48:03.660 --> 48:05.180]  Sounds like a Black Flag kind of show.
[48:05.180 --> 48:05.820]  Yep, yep, yep.
[48:05.820 --> 48:07.340]  Or is Punk Rock Mike when you need him?
[48:07.340 --> 48:08.540]  Steel Toed Sneakers.
[48:08.540 --> 48:09.100]  Steel.
[48:09.100 --> 48:10.140]  That's a cool ass band.
[48:10.140 --> 48:14.140]  I don't know if Punk Rock Mike can still have the moniker Punk Rock Mike when he's more of
[48:14.140 --> 48:14.940]  a hobo.
[48:14.940 --> 48:17.580]  I think he should just be Hobo Mike at this point.
[48:17.580 --> 48:18.700]  Fanned by the river, Mike.
[48:20.380 --> 48:21.980]  We're going to put this show back on track.
[48:21.980 --> 48:27.580]  You know, I wanted to relate my ganja meditation to your writing session.
[48:27.580 --> 48:32.700]  Like when you're just being stoned and being goofy, you're kind of doing the same thing,
[48:32.700 --> 48:33.500]  just in a different way.
[48:33.500 --> 48:36.380]  You're meditating and connecting with yourself the same way I am.
[48:36.380 --> 48:37.660]  Well, I'm still very new at it.
[48:37.660 --> 48:38.700]  Just on a different platform.
[48:39.340 --> 48:40.140]  Oh, that doesn't...
[48:40.140 --> 48:40.860]  I don't think that plays.
[48:40.860 --> 48:46.620]  No, I think that there's still more self-exploration to do that I haven't been willing to do yet,
[48:46.620 --> 48:47.900]  because I'm afraid of it.
[48:47.900 --> 48:48.220]  Okay.
[48:48.220 --> 48:48.780]  Do you know what I mean?
[48:48.780 --> 48:50.460]  Yeah, you want to smoke some DMT?
[48:50.460 --> 48:51.100]  No.
[48:51.100 --> 48:51.820]  No.
[48:51.820 --> 48:53.020]  I like DMT.
[48:53.020 --> 48:53.500]  Nice.
[48:53.500 --> 48:54.700]  I would like to smoke some DMT.
[48:55.660 --> 48:56.460]  Paul just lit up.
[48:56.460 --> 48:57.500]  He got a whole new demeanor.
[48:58.140 --> 49:00.380]  His thug life went up on his face.
[49:00.380 --> 49:01.660]  They don't test for DMT.
[49:02.220 --> 49:02.620]  So...
[49:02.620 --> 49:03.260]  No, I'm just kidding.
[49:03.260 --> 49:04.700]  Smushed Rose and DMT.
[49:04.700 --> 49:05.660]  My probate crystal.
[49:05.660 --> 49:06.220]  I'm just kidding.
[49:06.220 --> 49:07.100]  I would never.
[49:07.100 --> 49:07.900]  I would never do that.
[49:08.460 --> 49:09.580]  Hashtag lighter sounds.
[49:10.060 --> 49:10.620]  Hey.
[49:10.620 --> 49:13.580]  I have to abstain from alcohol and marijuana.
[49:13.580 --> 49:16.620]  They didn't say anything about PCP or anything like that.
[49:16.620 --> 49:19.500]  Like dimethyltryptamine or ayahuasca was on that list.
[49:19.500 --> 49:20.060]  Now, we can't...
[49:20.060 --> 49:21.100]  Yeah, we can.
[49:21.100 --> 49:25.340]  I was going to say we can't promote or condone any use of any illicit or psychedelic drugs.
[49:25.340 --> 49:29.100]  But yeah, fucking if you have real DMT, smoke DMT, learn about yourself.
[49:29.100 --> 49:29.660]  Get there.
[49:29.660 --> 49:31.340]  That's all I'm going to say about that.
[49:31.340 --> 49:33.660]  We're not going to talk too much about it on the show, but yeah.
[49:33.660 --> 49:33.900]  Wow.
[49:33.900 --> 49:34.380]  Do that.
[49:34.380 --> 49:34.780]  Go there.
[49:34.780 --> 49:35.420]  I'm out.
[49:35.420 --> 49:35.980]  Go there.
[49:35.980 --> 49:36.220]  I'm out.
[49:36.220 --> 49:36.380]  I'm out.
[49:36.380 --> 49:36.620]  I'm out.
[49:36.620 --> 49:36.780]  I'm out.
[49:36.780 --> 49:36.940]  I'm out.
[49:36.940 --> 49:37.100]  I'm out.
[49:37.100 --> 49:37.260]  I'm out.
[49:37.260 --> 49:37.420]  I'm out.
[49:37.820 --> 49:38.220]  Do that.
[49:38.220 --> 49:38.780]  Go there.
[49:38.780 --> 49:39.340]  I'm out.
[49:39.340 --> 49:39.980]  Go there.
[49:39.980 --> 49:40.540]  Do it, Clint.
[49:40.540 --> 49:40.780]  Do that.
[49:40.780 --> 49:41.260]  No.
[49:41.260 --> 49:45.900]  I'm not going to force anybody to do it, but if you're curious, if there's some shit inside
[49:45.900 --> 49:48.540]  yourself that you want to know about and you want to get inside your own head.
[49:48.540 --> 49:50.780]  You want to know how shitty of a human being you are.
[49:50.780 --> 49:52.620]  Or figure out how to stop being such a shitty human being.
[49:52.620 --> 49:53.500]  Exactly.
[49:53.500 --> 49:55.100]  Figure out how to stop being such a shitty human being.
[49:55.100 --> 49:57.980]  Take a good blast of DMT and sit back on the couch and close your eyes.
[49:59.340 --> 50:02.460]  The debate lately has been open our eyes, open or closed eyes.
[50:02.460 --> 50:03.180]  Close your eyes, dude.
[50:03.180 --> 50:04.060]  Get the full experience.
[50:04.060 --> 50:04.700]  Definitely.
[50:04.700 --> 50:05.260]  Close your eyes.
[50:05.260 --> 50:05.740]  See the color.
[50:05.740 --> 50:06.380]  Smell the smells.
[50:06.380 --> 50:07.020]  Taste the tastes.
[50:07.900 --> 50:08.700]  Oh, yeah.
[50:08.700 --> 50:10.300]  It's like a whole Starburst commercial.
[50:12.140 --> 50:12.460]  Yes.
[50:12.460 --> 50:13.740]  DMT flavored Starburst.
[50:13.740 --> 50:14.620]  There's nothing like it.
[50:15.420 --> 50:16.220]  All right.
[50:16.220 --> 50:17.260]  We've got almost an hour, guys.
[50:17.260 --> 50:18.220]  I'm not going to edit this at all.
[50:18.220 --> 50:19.740]  I'm going to put this out just like it was.
[50:19.740 --> 50:21.260]  I hope you didn't say anything too stupid.
[50:21.260 --> 50:21.980]  Uh-oh.
[50:21.980 --> 50:22.460]  Uh-oh.
[50:24.220 --> 50:24.940]  We did a few plugs.
[50:24.940 --> 50:26.540]  What's your Twitter handle, Paul?
[50:26.540 --> 50:28.380]  VHS underscore nerd.
[50:28.380 --> 50:29.660]  I collect VHS tapes.
[50:29.660 --> 50:33.900]  So if any of you guys out there want to get rid of your mom's old VHS collection, or if you have an
[50:33.900 --> 50:38.300]  old VHS collection, I'd definitely love to go through it and take what you don't want.
[50:38.300 --> 50:39.500]  There you go, guys.
[50:39.500 --> 50:41.340]  Do you have a PO box we could ship those to?
[50:41.340 --> 50:42.700]  No, I'll just come out and take them.
[50:42.700 --> 50:43.820]  Paul will come pick up.
[50:43.820 --> 50:46.380]  He'll drive all the way to Pennsylvania to come pick up your VHS tapes.
[50:46.380 --> 50:47.500]  Hit me up on Twitter.
[50:47.500 --> 50:50.780]  Check me out on Instagram, which is just VHS nerd to see all the stuff that I got.
[50:50.780 --> 50:54.300]  And, you know, just drop me a line, ladies.
[50:54.300 --> 50:57.420]  Is it hard to find a VCR to play that shit on now?
[50:57.420 --> 50:58.140]  Not really.
[50:59.180 --> 51:02.780]  The whole VHS thing is starting to get really popular.
[51:03.180 --> 51:04.220]  Because all the hipsters.
[51:04.220 --> 51:06.300]  I don't even necessarily think it's hipsters.
[51:06.300 --> 51:09.580]  I just think a lot of new movies are coming out.
[51:09.580 --> 51:15.900]  Like Maniac just got remade not recently with the fuck Frodo Baggins, whatever the fuck that guy's name is.
[51:16.460 --> 51:17.740]  Samwise Gandhi.
[51:17.740 --> 51:18.240]  No.
[51:20.620 --> 51:21.340]  The fuck's his name?
[51:21.340 --> 51:21.980]  Elijah Wood.
[51:21.980 --> 51:22.540]  Elijah Wood.
[51:22.540 --> 51:23.340]  There you go.
[51:23.340 --> 51:26.140]  I could see him in fucking Wilfred, but I just couldn't think of the name.
[51:26.140 --> 51:27.100]  That was a new movie.
[51:27.100 --> 51:30.460]  That was like a remake that he did that was released on VHS.
[51:31.100 --> 51:33.260]  So there's new VHS releases.
[51:33.260 --> 51:35.260]  There's also reissues of a lot of old stuff.
[51:35.260 --> 51:39.340]  A company just got done reissuing Cannibal Fero and Cannibal Holocaust,
[51:39.340 --> 51:42.540]  which are some Italian spaghetti splatter movies that are really good.
[51:43.820 --> 51:45.980]  I was waiting for the word spaghetti splatter to come up.
[51:45.980 --> 51:48.380]  Spaghetti splatter.
[51:48.380 --> 51:49.740]  Italian horror is where it's at.
[51:49.740 --> 51:52.300]  There's really nothing better than that, in my opinion.
[51:52.300 --> 51:54.780]  So if you have any Italian horror movies on tape, let me know.
[51:54.780 --> 51:55.420]  I'll take them.
[51:55.420 --> 51:56.300]  Let's get them to Paul.
[51:56.940 --> 51:59.580]  Don't you just have an internet connection where you can watch stuff?
[52:00.140 --> 52:00.940]  It's not the same.
[52:01.500 --> 52:01.820]  I agree.
[52:01.820 --> 52:05.020]  No, it's a lot of people like vinyl, and they will not use the iPod.
[52:05.020 --> 52:07.100]  I became a nerd in a video store.
[52:07.100 --> 52:12.140]  That was my favorite thing to do when my parents would not want to deal with me.
[52:12.140 --> 52:15.500]  And they're just like, oh, we'll just take him to the video store so we can rent a movie and a game.
[52:15.500 --> 52:16.780]  And that's where I became a nerd.
[52:16.780 --> 52:22.140]  And that's where I first saw my first horror big box and really got intrigued by the cover art.
[52:22.140 --> 52:28.780]  And that's really why when I go out and I search through tons and tons of tapes at thrift stores,
[52:28.780 --> 52:31.100]  I see something that I've never seen before.
[52:31.100 --> 52:32.380]  But the cover art's really good.
[52:32.380 --> 52:33.900]  But the movie's fucking terrible.
[52:33.900 --> 52:36.060]  I love it because the cover art's so good.
[52:36.620 --> 52:38.380]  And I just love shitty movies.
[52:38.380 --> 52:39.820]  What's the shittiest?
[52:39.820 --> 52:42.140]  What's the best shitty movie you've watched?
[52:42.140 --> 52:46.380]  The best shitty movie is definitely You're the Hunter from the Future.
[52:47.180 --> 52:51.180]  That is the shittiest fucking movie I have ever seen.
[52:51.180 --> 52:57.820]  It starts out kind of like a fantasy epic where they're fighting dinosaurs and barbarians.
[52:57.820 --> 53:03.180]  And there's a point when he uses a pterodactyl as a hang glider to kick someone in the face.
[53:03.180 --> 53:04.060]  As you do.
[53:04.060 --> 53:06.860]  And then it just segues into, now he's the hunter from the future,
[53:06.860 --> 53:07.900]  so I should have seen this coming.
[53:07.900 --> 53:11.020]  It segues into androids and spaceships and all kinds of shit.
[53:11.020 --> 53:13.260]  It's just the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen.
[53:13.260 --> 53:14.300]  Holy shit.
[53:14.300 --> 53:15.420]  It's amazing though.
[53:15.420 --> 53:19.500]  So if you can check it out, you can actually watch it on YouTube for like $3
[53:19.500 --> 53:20.780]  is You're the Hunter from the Future.
[53:20.780 --> 53:21.100]  Nice.
[53:21.100 --> 53:23.340]  Or if any girls want to come over to my house.
[53:23.340 --> 53:24.860]  Or any dudes like we heard earlier.
[53:24.860 --> 53:26.860]  Or any dudes, you know, we'll get weird.
[53:26.860 --> 53:27.340]  It's fine.
[53:28.300 --> 53:29.820]  Come watch some tapes.
[53:29.820 --> 53:30.700]  Bring your own couch.
[53:31.740 --> 53:34.540]  But it's up there with that one and then Chopping Mall.
[53:34.540 --> 53:36.700]  Oh man, I've seen Chopping Mall.
[53:36.700 --> 53:37.900]  Chopping Mall is fucking great.
[53:37.900 --> 53:40.220]  Years and years ago, like on HBO or Cinemax.
[53:40.220 --> 53:40.940]  It's really bad.
[53:40.940 --> 53:42.620]  Dude, remember USA Up all night?
[53:42.620 --> 53:42.860]  Yes.
[53:42.860 --> 53:44.620]  I think that's where I saw Chopping Mall.
[53:44.620 --> 53:45.100]  That makes sense.
[53:45.100 --> 53:46.860]  I think that's where I saw that shit.
[53:46.860 --> 53:49.100]  It was clean enough to be on USA.
[53:49.100 --> 53:50.940]  Yeah, I was a little guy.
[53:50.940 --> 53:53.100]  My mom would watch USA Up all night with me.
[53:53.100 --> 53:54.300]  Probably where we saw it.
[53:54.300 --> 53:56.700]  That's the first time that I saw Toxic Avenger.
[53:56.700 --> 53:58.220]  Oh yeah, what's up Toxie?
[53:58.220 --> 53:59.500]  I miss that shit.
[53:59.500 --> 54:00.620]  Love the Toxic Avenger.
[54:00.620 --> 54:01.420]  My hero.
[54:01.420 --> 54:02.380]  Monster hero.
[54:02.380 --> 54:02.780]  Nice.
[54:02.780 --> 54:03.660]  That's on Netflix.
[54:03.660 --> 54:04.620]  Trauma.
[54:04.620 --> 54:05.740]  Yeah, I have it on.
[54:05.740 --> 54:07.340]  I have two copies on VHS.
[54:07.340 --> 54:10.380]  I have an unrated copy and I have the edited R-rated copy.
[54:10.380 --> 54:13.260]  I was just giving everybody an option to go see it.
[54:13.260 --> 54:13.660]  Yeah.
[54:13.660 --> 54:14.540]  If they want to go watch it.
[54:14.540 --> 54:17.740]  If you haven't seen the Toxic Avenger and you love pot,
[54:17.740 --> 54:19.180]  you should definitely get really high
[54:19.900 --> 54:21.260]  and then watch the Toxic Avenger.
[54:21.260 --> 54:22.300]  You'll laugh your ass off.
[54:22.300 --> 54:23.180]  There you go.
[54:23.180 --> 54:24.380]  All right, Clint, it's your turn.
[54:24.380 --> 54:25.500]  Plugs, where do we find you?
[54:26.460 --> 54:29.340]  Instagram and everywhere.
[54:29.340 --> 54:31.180]  It's at tallclint.
[54:31.180 --> 54:32.860]  He hasn't been doing much social media, you guys.
[54:32.860 --> 54:33.740]  He's taking a break.
[54:33.740 --> 54:35.180]  He's letting his brain simmer.
[54:35.180 --> 54:37.820]  I've been going crazy with social media, so check me out.
[54:38.940 --> 54:40.700]  Yeah, and also check out the Wild Cousins.
[54:40.700 --> 54:41.500]  Oh yeah, Wild Cousins.
[54:41.500 --> 54:42.380]  Oh yeah, yeah, those guys.
[54:42.380 --> 54:43.900]  We should probably keep an eye on them.
[54:43.900 --> 54:45.660]  We have t-shirts too, Clint.
[54:45.660 --> 54:46.860]  We do have t-shirts.
[54:46.860 --> 54:47.180]  You do.
[54:47.180 --> 54:48.620]  It's 10 bucks.
[54:48.620 --> 54:49.260]  They're cozy.
[54:49.260 --> 54:49.980]  I wear one.
[54:49.980 --> 54:50.620]  I've got one.
[54:50.620 --> 54:51.100]  They're nice.
[54:51.100 --> 54:51.740]  Thank you, buddy.
[54:51.740 --> 54:52.460]  Came from you.
[54:52.460 --> 54:52.780]  Yeah.
[54:52.780 --> 54:53.420]  Thank you, thank you.
[54:54.220 --> 54:54.860]  You can find me.
[54:54.860 --> 54:56.620]  It's at irigenetics on Instagram.
[54:57.180 --> 55:01.500]  If you want to find the podcast, it's at GFYHpodcast on Twitter.
[55:01.500 --> 55:02.860]  Of course, there's a Facebook.
[55:02.860 --> 55:04.540]  I've got my own Facebook and Twitter.
[55:04.540 --> 55:06.940]  There's a lot of social media going on in my world.
[55:06.940 --> 55:07.820]  You can find me.
[55:07.820 --> 55:09.100]  Just search, search, search, search.
[55:09.100 --> 55:10.220]  You'll find it all.
[55:10.220 --> 55:11.500]  Kids, thanks for listening.
[55:11.500 --> 55:12.460]  I'll be back.
[55:12.460 --> 55:16.140]  The Cannabis Cup is coming up, so I'm going to have to do some pre-recording and shit
[55:16.140 --> 55:19.180]  to get through that week, but I'll do a lot of good stuff for you.
[55:19.180 --> 55:20.700]  I hope to see you at the Cannabis Cup.
[55:21.500 --> 55:25.340]  After the Cannabis Cup, April 26th at Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies,
[55:25.340 --> 55:27.020]  there is a growers meeting at six o'clock.
[55:27.660 --> 55:28.300]  Be there.
[55:28.300 --> 55:29.180]  I'm going to speak.
[55:29.180 --> 55:30.060]  Jesse's going to speak.
[55:30.060 --> 55:31.900]  We're kind of debating what we're going to talk about.
[55:31.900 --> 55:35.260]  We will finalize that and start writing out our parts here pretty soon.
[55:36.540 --> 55:37.900]  Big thanks to these guys for coming.
[55:37.900 --> 55:38.380]  Thanks, boys.
[55:38.380 --> 55:38.860]  Thanks for having us.
[55:38.860 --> 55:40.780]  Oh, man, I've wanted to get you on for a little while.
[55:40.780 --> 55:41.660]  It's fun.
[55:41.660 --> 55:43.500]  It is definitely fun having you guys on.
[55:43.500 --> 55:46.620]  Bring some normal folks instead of a bunch of grownards onto the show once in a while.
[55:46.620 --> 55:47.120]  Yeah.

[56:43.340 --> 56:43.900]  For today.
[56:43.900 --> 56:44.860]  That was hard to say.
[56:44.860 --> 56:45.420]  Dabbed out.
[56:45.420 --> 56:46.220]  I need another dab.
[56:46.540 --> 56:47.900]  A big, huge shout out to my ninja, Spence.

[56:52.140 --> 56:53.820]  I appreciate the help and all of your guidance.
[56:54.380 --> 56:56.060]  So until next time, take a fat dab.
[56:56.860 --> 56:58.220]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[57:16.540 --> 57:56.060]  Yo, what's up, cannabis community?
[57:56.060 --> 57:59.980]  It's time for episode number 63 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[58:05.660 --> 58:08.540]  if you're a new smoker or an old school dabber,
[58:08.540 --> 58:11.900]  if you're a cannabis activist or someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[58:11.900 --> 58:14.620]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[58:14.620 --> 58:15.740]  Thanks again for joining me.

[58:18.780 --> 58:20.060]  for letting me use their music on the show.
[58:20.060 --> 58:23.340]  Thanks a lot to Kat and Coop and the whole Mystic Roots crew.
[58:23.980 --> 58:25.660]  Guys, I've got an exciting show for you.
[58:25.660 --> 58:27.660]  It's a room full of breeders tonight.
[58:27.660 --> 58:30.940]  Sitting to my left is my good buddy, Rob from Sour Seeds.
[58:30.940 --> 58:31.580]  How you doing, bro?
[58:31.580 --> 58:32.460]  How you doing, man?
[58:32.460 --> 58:33.100]  I'm great, dude.
[58:33.100 --> 58:33.820]  Thanks for coming to the spot.
[58:33.820 --> 58:34.860]  Hey, thanks for having us, Jeff.
[58:34.860 --> 58:35.580]  A little bit like that.
[58:35.580 --> 58:36.060]  There you go.
[58:36.060 --> 58:36.540]  That'll help you out.
[58:36.540 --> 58:37.500]  Yeah, thanks for having us, buddy.
[58:37.500 --> 58:38.700]  Oh, dude, thanks a lot for coming.
[58:38.700 --> 58:40.380]  Right in front of me here is my good buddy, Rusty,
[58:40.380 --> 58:42.460]  my new friend, Rusty from Cannaventure Seeds.
[58:42.460 --> 58:43.020]  How you doing, bro?
[58:43.020 --> 58:43.820]  Good to be here, man.
[58:43.820 --> 58:44.220]  Thank you.
[58:44.220 --> 58:44.620]  Good, dude.
[58:44.620 --> 58:44.860]  Good.
[58:44.860 --> 58:47.020]  You got a little cold today, so if you need to take a break or anything, man,
[58:47.020 --> 58:47.660]  just let me know, dude.
[58:47.660 --> 58:48.220]  Thank you, man.
[58:48.220 --> 58:49.340]  No pressure on you.
[58:49.340 --> 58:51.020]  If your headphones go flying, I understand.
[58:51.020 --> 58:53.260]  I'm going to kill the music so we can pay attention to each other.
[58:53.260 --> 58:55.340]  Before I get too far, I need to give a huge shout out to
[58:55.340 --> 58:57.740]  Byrne and Jesse from Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.

[59:28.140 --> 59:29.180]  No special discount.
[59:29.180 --> 59:30.620]  Actually, a special discount for everybody.
[59:30.620 --> 59:31.580]  It's what it is.
[59:31.580 --> 59:33.180]  Everyone gets a huge hookup.
[59:33.180 --> 59:35.980]  Also, the organic portions of this episode are brought to you by my good friends
[59:35.980 --> 59:37.340]  at the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[59:37.340 --> 59:40.700]  Go say what's up to Jay at the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in Colorado Springs.
[59:40.700 --> 59:43.820]  Get some fresh worm castings, African nightcrawlers, red wigglers,
[59:43.820 --> 59:45.820]  and all of your soil amendments.

[59:48.620 --> 59:49.420]  so go check them out.
[59:49.420 --> 59:53.020]  If you're not in Colorado, you can check them out at RockyMountainWormCompany.com.
[59:53.020 --> 59:55.660]  They will mail you all of the amendments that I used.
[59:55.660 --> 59:57.900]  Jay wants his paper right here so we can write down that address.
[59:58.460 --> 59:59.260]  Go check them out, dude.
[59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.380]  Those guys have great stuff.
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.580]  They'll give you a tour of the place.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.820]  They'll set you up with all kinds of cool shit.
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.780]  Yeah, I've heard about them.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.580]  Dude, they're great people.
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:08.140]  If you go up there, let them know that you heard about them from the show.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.500]  If you call them and tell them you're coming,
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.620]  they'll definitely give you a tour.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:14.300]  You can go stick your hands in the worms and feel the worms, where they make the worms.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.340]  They actually feed the worms chanomele.
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:21.260]  We've talked about this on another episode, but there's O-Vape or O-Pen Vape.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:25.980]  It's a vape cartridge company, and they make extracts for the cartridges for the pens.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:30.140]  They take all their ground up leftover material and feed that to the worms that are running the
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:30.780]  worm farm.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.340]  That's awesome.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:34.460]  So it's going from plant to worm to plant to worm.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.700]  We're keeping it in the cycle and recycling it.
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.020]  So a big, huge shout out to all the sponsors.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.740]  Oh, since these guys are here, we'll do another commercial that I've been skipping for this month.

[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.420]  Man, you guys ready for the Cannabis Cup?
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:20.140]  Absolutely.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:20.780]  Absolutely.
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.660]  Yeah, we're talking about the booth and everything that's going on.
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:24.140]  Absolutely.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.820]  Busy, busy year ahead.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:26.780]  Full tour.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:27.260]  Full tour.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.140]  So you're going to do every cup?
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.340]  Just about, yeah.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:34.460]  We're probably going to skip Seattle this year, but we are doing Oregon, Michigan, Denver.
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.100]  We'll also be doing the 710 Cup in Denver.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.980]  We have the San Francisco Cup.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:40.620]  San Francisco.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.740]  So Sour Seeds is killing it.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.420]  Is Cannaventure joining for everything?
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:44.620]  Oh, yeah, I think so.
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:45.180]  I think so.
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.380]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:46.620]  Nice.
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.060]  What are you smoking on over there, bro?
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.180]  Oh, some Jeff's.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.140]  Oh, you got the Jeff's.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:50.940]  What are you smoking on?
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.300]  This is a Dante.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.780]  It is a come from pharmaceuticals in Denver.
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:55.580]  Oh, nice.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:59.020]  We acquired the cut through Dan Hayat, who was recently in TITIMES last year.
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:02.940]  He's a homegrown Pueblo caregiver right here.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.700]  He tested out a couple strains.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:09.420]  His Dante tested 28.8 and his kilowatt was 29.3.
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:09.980]  Wow.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:10.860]  Impressive test.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.260]  It was.
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.820]  They actually tested it three times over each test.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:17.900]  They did the first sample for the first $50 and then they gave him the rest of the samples
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.900]  for free just to make sure they didn't make a mistake.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:20.620]  It was so high.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:21.260]  Sweet.
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.500]  So yeah, he's been doing a lot of things.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:28.540]  He was working with Dan Skye from High Times Magazine right now, and he's out in Westcliff
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:31.420]  doing his thing this year, and hopefully we'll see him around.
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.820]  Yeah, he's invited to the podcast if you want to bring him on.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:34.940]  I think I know the guy.
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:35.420]  Yeah.
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:35.980]  I think I know who you're talking about.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.500]  Yeah, Dan, Dan, Dan, the man.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.780]  He used to come in the shop all the time.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:39.660]  He's a good guy.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.300]  Good guy, man.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:45.180]  Yeah, he gave me the cut and it's actually pineapple grenades crossed with a skunk triple
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:45.660]  six.
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:46.300]  Very cool.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:50.620]  So we've taken it now and we're taking it a step further and creating the Dante's Inferno,
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.460]  which is the same hybrid crossed out with the OG18.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:55.980]  Oh, nice, nice.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.260]  I was actually going to ask a few breeding questions and stuff of you on the show, but
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.220]  it sounds like a good time.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.340]  My first question is going to be to both of you guys.
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.140]  How did you get into the breeding game and how long have you been breeding?
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:09.100]  I've actually been breeding since I was about 15 or 16 years old.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:12.460]  My parents were longtime growers in the state of Florida, South Florida.
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.820]  We were underground growers.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:16.860]  We had large horticulture nursery, about five and a half, six acres.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.340]  We had a whiteout greenhouse.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.740]  It was a 30 by 100 feet.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.260]  Full of cannabis?
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:23.900]  Full of cannabis.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:24.460]  In Florida?
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.020]  In Florida.
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.500]  You got balls of steel or your parents had balls of steel.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:31.900]  Yes, my mom actually took her until she was almost 60 years old and recently, last five
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.900]  years, she actually did get incarcerated.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.380]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:35.020]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:39.020]  Oh, and it was kind of messed up because it's just one of those things.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.260]  Yeah, she was busted with around 24 plants.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:46.620]  She did get a slap on the wrist board and unfortunately for her, they did find out the
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:49.180]  FBI came in and they were doing a drug sting.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.260]  The guys were taking the money.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.140]  They were taking the money.
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:52.940]  They were stealing the money.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:58.620]  They were stealing the cannabis and they were flipping it back on the streets and about 12
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:03:59.820]  officers were involved in it.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.140]  And it was in big news down in Tampa for the last year or so, last couple of years.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.820]  So your mom's kind of a celebrity for cannabis.
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:06.300]  Pretty much.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:06.780]  Absolutely.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.380]  She's been a freedom fighter her whole life.
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:10.460]  What do we call her on the show to give her a shout out?
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:11.820]  Sherry, mama.
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:12.780]  Big shout out, Sherry.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.300]  Big shout out for being a cannabis warrior.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:14.940]  Is she free now?
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:15.420]  Is she out?
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:15.980]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.660]  She's here and now she's living in Colorado.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:18.780]  It's a great state of Colorado.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:19.660]  Keep her out of trouble here.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.700]  That's absolutely it.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.500]  She's loving the freedom.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.980]  She's loving the mountains, the atmosphere and the people, man.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:25.260]  The people, the attitude's great here.
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.460]  Welcome home, mama sour seeds.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:27.180]  We're glad to have you.
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:27.580]  That's right.
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.020]  We'll keep you out of trouble here.
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.820]  So Rusty, my friend with Cannaventure, dude, you're a cool ass dude.
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:32.540]  I'm glad I met you today.
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.300]  We're going to have some fun times together, bro.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.100]  Absolutely.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.460]  How long have you been in this breeding game?
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:42.460]  I guess about six years, but I mean, I've been breeding forever.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.020]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.540]  Who doesn't?
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:44.860]  Yeah.
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:47.260]  What grower doesn't like see plants?
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.340]  Okay, so that's a good question.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:52.620]  How long into your growing career did it take you to get breeding?
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:53.820]  Man.
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:59.100]  I'd say for the first, I don't know, four or five years, it was just straight growing.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.940]  You first get started, outdoor or whatever.
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:05.980]  But I'd say six, seven years before.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.540]  You know what I mean?
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.100]  That's about right.
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.140]  Well, that's how long it takes you.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.420]  Four to six years seems to be for most of the major breeders that I've talked to.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.860]  When I grew those plants the first couple of years, I knew I had to breed, but then
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.540]  you have to figure out how and where.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:17.100]  Right.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:20.780]  I mean, being from the area that we were in in the underground, you couldn't just back
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:24.700]  in the early 90s and stuff and being in places like Florida, which is one of the worst states
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:28.620]  to possibly grow it in, Virginia, places like that, East Coast, is really, really throw
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:30.220]  you under the bus, lock you up.
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:31.180]  That's about it.
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:31.740]  You know?
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:35.980]  And you couldn't really order seeds and get certain strains.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.820]  And whenever you got good genetics and you got good males, you may do with what you had.
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.660]  And then you used a lot of older genetics.
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:45.580]  I personally used a lot of older genetics when we were younger from parents passed down
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:49.100]  Gainesville Green, old Afghans, a lot of old Afghani and stuff.
[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:52.940]  A lot of the old piney, you know, good piney buds that came out of Florida back in the
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:53.740]  day in the 80s.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:56.140]  And Florida's known for a lot of great digs.
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:56.700]  It is.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:57.260]  It really is.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.540]  They're getting upgraded in my opinion.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:05:59.100]  Absolutely.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:05:59.660]  Absolutely.
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.380]  The last few years, they've really been known for it and noticed.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:02.940]  Absolutely.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:07.180]  I would say in the last 10 years, there's actually been statistics to show that there's
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:10.780]  more growers indoors that get busted every year in Florida than there are registered
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.460]  cannabis users in California.
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:13.180]  Wow.
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:13.900]  Wow.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.860]  So we see this all the time on this show.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:20.860]  Uh, the logical step here, fucking legalize it in Florida.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.420]  Absolutely.
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:21.660]  Right.
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:22.140]  Absolutely.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.500]  I mean, why, you know, banging down little old ladies, you know, doors and dragging them
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:25.820]  out and-
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:29.020]  Because your mom, I'm pretty sure at her age now, she's a hardcore criminal, right?
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:29.660]  I'm sure she was-
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:30.620]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.220]  You know, absolutely.
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.380]  Open the door for them and told them to come right on in.
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.180]  You know, I mean, it was-
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.940]  She made them cookies while we were talking about the plant.
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.420]  Just about.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.980]  She's one of those type of women, but my mom's a really cool lady.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:42.700]  She just, uh, she gets you high first and then makes you cookies.
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:43.660]  There you go.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:44.380]  Come on in officer.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.060]  I'll roll a joint while you cuff everybody.
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.300]  That's a totally her attitude.
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:49.020]  That's awesome.
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:49.820]  Oh, I'm glad she's here.
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:53.340]  I hope we get to smoke out one day if she's still a pot smoker.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:53.820]  All right.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.260]  We got to get it back on course, man.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.700]  We get so ADD'd in this show.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:57.820]  So-
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:58.620]  ADD.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:06:59.340]  That's it, man.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.700]  What, uh, we kind of skipped over how long you've been breeding a little bit.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:04.300]  So you've been breeding for about six years, right?
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.300]  You've been in the game for about six years.
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:06.540]  Yeah.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:10.140]  Well, I guess I've been selling seeds for like six, six years or so, you know what I mean?
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:17.740]  But definitely for, uh, uh, since I started, you know, 10, 11 years, something like that.
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:19.260]  Nice.
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:22.700]  What's, uh, what are some of your favorite strains that you've, what are now,
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.540]  what are some of your now current favorite strains to grow?
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.420]  What are you, as far as like clone only's or-
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:29.420]  Whatever you were going to like.
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.580]  If I was like, so you can fill this whole room with whatever you want,
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.940]  you get three strains to pick.
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.740]  Okay.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:34.540]  Yeah.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.220]  I'd say cookie wreck, you know.
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:37.660]  Very cool choice.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:41.580]  Cookies a little fucking whatever, you know, but out of proportion, but, uh,
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:45.500]  but no, I've seen a shout out to garden of Weeden grow the shit out of your cookie rack.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:45.900]  Yeah.
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.060]  Yeah.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.180]  I haven't seen it.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:47.580]  Out of it.
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.580]  So you owe them a high five.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:50.300]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:50.700]  Thank you.
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.100]  Thank you.
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.100]  Uh, I don't know.
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:53.740]  Triple Nova.
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.980]  That's a new, that's some packs I brought you today.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.220]  Okay.
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:56.860]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:56.940]  Yeah.
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.420]  Thanks for that.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.180]  We'll run that pretty soon to take pictures.
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:07:59.500]  Yeah.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:04.940]  It's triangle cush and blackberry cush clone BX outcross by train wreck Arcada.
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:05.500]  That's gorgeous.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.460]  I got head seeds.
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:06.700]  Yeah.
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:07.660]  This BX too.
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:07.900]  Okay.
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:11.340]  Uh, my third one, let's see.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.780]  Uh, okay.
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:17.100]  I'm working on one now.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.180]  Texas kids, bloody Mary cut.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:19.740]  I don't know.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:24.460]  It's, it's pretty rare cut, but, uh, working that back with, uh, orange diesel,
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:33.420]  Cali's 77 cut and a Calio cut with fair rights or no.
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.860]  Some is New York city diesel.
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:35.500]  Oh, very cool.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.140]  Anything so much.
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:36.620]  I love that.
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:39.580]  Sounds like a great cross there.
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.620]  Now, random question on offshoot of that.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.700]  Are those your top sellers by any chance?
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.340]  And I know one can't be, cause you're still making it, but the cookie Rick sounds like
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.700]  it's probably one of your top sellers.
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:49.500]  That's definitely one.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:49.740]  Yeah.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.260]  That's, that's a great, great stream.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.300]  I've seen did Cole.
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:53.580]  Yeah.
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.220]  It matches up.
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:55.820]  Both parents match up just perfect.
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:56.060]  Perfect.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:00.300]  Like, it doesn't sound like it, but once you know, you get to know both parents from the
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:04.140]  brooder aspect, you could tell that that's the beautiful one because guys, here's a hint
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:08.540]  that I don't talk about a lot, that more, the more difference, the most difference in
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.780]  your parents, the better the outcome in your cross.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:11.100]  Right.
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.860]  If you've got completely different parents, the better your crosses are going to be in
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:15.580]  my opinion.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:16.620]  Natural selection.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:17.340]  Yes.
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:17.980]  Yeah.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:19.100]  So bro, over here, Mr.
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.060]  Sour seeds.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.940]  Uh, what are some of your favorite strains to grow a top three, top three.
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:26.700]  I'd probably say one of my number one strains is still to this day is probably the original
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.380]  Kim dog D or Kim four.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:28.860]  Okay.
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.380]  It's still to this day.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:33.660]  It's not the process strain in the world, but it has some of the greatest flavors, you
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:34.380]  know, all around.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.180]  It's just got the bang.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:35.900]  It's got the flavor.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:36.620]  It's got the punch.
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:38.620]  It's got the yield bag appeal, the yield.
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:39.740]  It's it's all there.
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:40.860]  You know, that loud.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:41.340]  That's it.
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:46.540]  And it's one of the original true OGs, you know, I'd say right now to still is one of
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:49.180]  my family's, uh, original strains from way back.
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:52.300]  We've, we've held this cut for probably close to eight to 10 years now.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.740]  It's a, one of our original blueberries.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:57.660]  It's a, the old original blueberry yum yum used to hear about from ludicrous and back
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.940]  in the day and things like that.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.460]  It's, it's not DJ's blueberry.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:05.180]  It's a very Indica dominant blueberry almost smells like ripe oranges halfway through flowering.
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.780]  And then it really takes on a really sweet blueberry appeal during finishing ripening.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:15.180]  Um, very, very potent, very frosty, um, very couch lock, you know, quick eight, nine weeks
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:17.420]  or, you know, it's, it's a very indica planted.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.980]  It's not going to take you 10 weeks to flower out.
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:24.620]  Um, and another one we run is, uh, probably a big one that we're having a big release
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:29.260]  on now is, uh, the space dragon, which is a true West MLA and Cush land race crossed
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:31.180]  with the original Kim 91 back cross male.
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:36.940]  So this was, this was a cross that was done probably seven, eight years ago in Florida.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.260]  Okay.
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:41.100]  And right now it's one of the hottest things in Atlanta, Georgia has been nice for years
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:45.500]  down there and in Rand, Tallahassee, Florida and FSU college for, I don't know how many
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.660]  years we slung that stuff out on the streets and, uh, people can't get enough of it.
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:53.820]  We've, we've gotten reviews from everywhere from, you know, the little guy to, uh, people
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:55.020]  that fight for the UFC.
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:11:01.100]  We, we, we've actually sold pot to people like Sebastian, Sebastian Janikowski and,
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.340]  uh, you know, big football players.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:07.740]  And I mean, it's, it's the guys, they, they just can't, they can't get enough of the space
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:08.300]  dragon, man.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.740]  It's just, it's, it's strong.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.540]  It's devastating.
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:13.100]  It lays you out and, and then you really can't think on it.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:16.460]  You know, it's one of those, even for the heavy smoker, if you're looking for something
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.940]  like that, that just really, you really want to get stoned, you know what I mean?
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:19.820]  Just really.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.940]  I mean, cause you build up tolerance over years and years and years of doing this and
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:27.180]  you look for sought out strains that you, you know, that, that won't burn you out.
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:30.460]  And you know, seven, eight years, I can still smoke this stuff and it still does the same
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.380]  effect in me that it did back in the day.
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:32.700]  You know?
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:37.180]  And so we're, so we're trying to, that's kind of an old school, new school kind of a combo
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:37.420]  there.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:41.340]  It is, it is like, like you said, very diverse genetics, you know, taking something from
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:45.580]  here in America and then taking the best of the, you know, the, you know, and across the
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:48.460]  world, you know, and just trying to combine those genetics to give somebody something
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.740]  really, really special.
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:55.420]  I'm imagining kind of a real spicy, uh, real hashy, earthy, spicy kind of a smell.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:59.980]  It is real earthy and it has a spice to it, but it's actually, it's really hard to really
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:00.540]  describe Jeff.
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.860]  It's, it's, it's, it's been described as like really sweet, but also has like a very
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:07.260]  overwhelming scent of BO, like body odor.
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:08.860]  I love that kind of weed.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:13.900]  The Jeff's OG he's playing with has a, like a swampy, funky foot BO kind of a dog to it.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:17.580]  It's really BO to it, but it's, it's on the sweeter side and it has that, that kind of
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:20.620]  citrusy twang kind of funk from the chem 91 in there.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.340]  You know, it's, it's really original.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.940]  It's really, really unique and anybody that's ever had, it's really, truly enjoyed it.
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:27.340]  Nice.
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.940]  Well, I look forward to my seed pack.
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:29.660]  Absolutely.
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:30.220]  Absolutely.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:30.860]  Coming soon.
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:31.340]  I like that.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.220]  Or my clone, you know, yeah, I can do that.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.580]  There's nothing like a clone from your bro.
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:36.220]  Clones are better.
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.180]  So that was two strains.
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.100]  You got the chem and then you got your space dragon.
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.220]  What's strain number three?
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:40.940]  That was the blueberry.
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:41.500]  Oh, the blueberry.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:41.820]  You're right.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.060]  Sorry.
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:42.620]  I see dabs.
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:44.780]  I'm going to blame it on a head injury.
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:47.500]  I can probably, I can probably do one or two more episodes.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:53.900]  So if you guys have been listening and you heard about that, I had a serious, I had a
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:58.860]  serious concussion, but I had a minor brain bleed and I was down for about, it's been
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:02.460]  seven days now and I'm still a little goofy when I wake up and it takes me like an hour
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.380]  to get my shit together, but I'm going to be fine guys.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.620]  A couple of people told me to get well and I appreciate it.
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:06.780]  Yeah.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.380]  My brain was bleeding inside my head.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:08.940]  It's crazy.
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.300]  And my eyes were wobbling and shit.
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:11.420]  That was a little goofy.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:14.860]  So if you've listened to the last two episodes, I was doing that fully concussed.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:18.220]  Yeah.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.100]  It's good.
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.020]  Apparently I blew off two people.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:23.980]  I was supposed to meet somebody somewhere and I blew them off completely.
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:25.340]  Like I had no idea.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:28.620]  And so somebody was not nice enough to say he hit his head.
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.220]  Please be nice about that.
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:31.820]  Well, at least you had a legitimate excuse.
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:32.140]  Yeah.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:35.260]  This time I wasn't just dabbing on the couch like last time.
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.140]  All right.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:37.340]  So those are your three favorites.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.340]  Which of those, oh, he's coughing.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:40.300]  Got to give him a second.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:44.460]  Are those, since one's not released yet, are those your best sellers or do you even release
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:47.420]  the, you can't sell the blueberry yum yum because it's not yours to release.
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:47.980]  Right.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:49.580]  Well, it is mine to release.
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:52.380]  So far I'm the only one in Colorado that has that cut.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.500]  I brought it here from Florida.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.060]  We actually brought it in the computer case, 2000 miles over here.
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.340]  These guys are mad men.
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:58.140]  We are mad men.
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:58.860]  We take the risk.
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.460]  We take the risk and we appreciate it.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:03.180]  You know, we, we tried to bring some diverse genetics this way.
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:07.020]  We only brought, you know, a couple of strains with us, but it was our best, you know, and
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.540]  that's what we brought with us.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.940]  A lot of the old, old strains are dead and gone.
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:12.300]  Gainesville green is dead and gone.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.340]  Is it?
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:13.820]  It's sad.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.180]  It is dead and gone.
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:18.060]  My, my, my uncle actually was, had a big hand in that.
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.820]  And today to this day, you know, he still grows cannabis, but he's completely blind.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:22.220]  Wow.
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:26.700]  And he literally takes care of massive greenhouses and his plants look beautiful and amazing.
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:30.540]  And he's been growing the same strains, the blueberry yum yum, um, Gainesville green and
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:31.180]  things like that.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.140]  And so got it.
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:35.900]  As far as I know, he, I haven't, I haven't talked to that man in so long.
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:39.180]  It is, but, uh, it's a good guy to get in contact with, man.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:39.740]  Absolutely.
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:42.860]  But you know, it's, it's, it's, it's sad.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.500]  It's, it's like a lot of the old skunks, the old original skunk.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.100]  They've all, these have been outcrossed.
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:50.940]  I mean, there's things that you can find in Florida that are very close, but it's an outcross.
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:55.660]  I grew up in SoCal and there was a skunk strain there that I've never smelled since I've left
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:56.300]  that area.
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:59.820]  I was in the long beach area was where my herb was coming from.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.980]  And dude, I've never smelled anything like it.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:08.220]  The closest I've gotten was I was at a Phil Leshen friend show at Red Rocks in 1999.
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:10.300]  And this dude said humble gold for sale.
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.460]  And I was like, holy shit.
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:15.420]  Cause I remember the old humble and I walked over there and I was like, how much for a
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:15.980]  quarter bro?
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.180]  And he's like 90 bucks.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.100]  And I handed him a hundred dollar bill and just walked away.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:21.180]  I was like, have a great weekend, keep the 10 bucks.
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:22.460]  I'm happy as shit.
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:27.660]  And that was as close as I've gotten since I left California to the smell of just that
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:28.860]  Cali dank.
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:29.580]  I kind of miss it.
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:29.980]  Yeah.
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:32.780]  Every once in a while you do, you come across that.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:37.420]  And, and, and it's very rare though, nowadays, you know, that it hasn't been put its hands
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.660]  on or it's, it's really locked down on inner circles.
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:41.260]  All right.
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:45.420]  Mr. Canaventure, do you prefer to grow or breed sativas or indica?
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.140]  I said a weird question.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.020]  I fucked that question up.
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:50.460]  Do you prefer to grow and breed indica or sativas is what I was aiming for.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.500]  Man, you take more dabs.
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.780]  I'm going to dabble you answer.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:53.020]  Yeah.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:54.380]  Oh man.
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:55.980]  Preferably, man.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:59.900]  I like, uh, I like to smoke like sativa hybrids, you know what I mean?
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:00.140]  Okay.
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.140]  So, I mean, I don't know.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:06.060]  I do, I do bring with some, uh, straight up a hundred percent indica stick real dominant
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:09.260]  indica down stuff, but, uh, you got to keep those.
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:13.660]  You have to, you know, the CBD patients, patients need their medicine too.
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:14.060]  Yeah.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:14.380]  Yeah.
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:14.700]  All right.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.780]  So you have to, you have to, you have to a little bit of both.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:20.380]  I, I tend to catch myself breeding heavier toward the sativa side.
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:21.180]  Just because you like it.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:21.740]  I like this.
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:27.900]  I think that 10 or 17 day extra longer flowering period really does something to a plant.
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:32.300]  And just out of indica smoke, even at nighttime, you know, now that I've gotten older, I feel
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.300]  like smoking indica just makes me too lazy.
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:35.100]  I own a company.
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:35.900]  I've got gardens.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:37.420]  I've got a job I got shit to do.
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:41.420]  You know, I gotta be, so I take dabs of sativa to keep me moving and motivated.
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:42.380]  I don't even smoke.
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:43.260]  I really don't smoke.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:45.420]  I mean, yeah, I really don't smoke indica man.
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:45.980]  You know what I mean?
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:47.500]  Good enough.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:47.900]  Yeah.
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:48.460]  Yeah.
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:52.620]  I mean, you still have some that you love, you know, that you know, that are good, but
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:53.820]  I don't know.
[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:54.380]  Preferably.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:54.860]  Yeah.
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:55.900]  Something I find weird.
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:17:00.300]  I like growing, smoking and breeding completely different strains for different reasons.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.380]  And if I'm going to grow one, I pick a room for growth.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:03.740]  If I'm going to breed, I want these.
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:05.820]  And if I'm going to smoke, I want this.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.740]  Completely different batches of plants.
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:09.660]  How about yourself, man?
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:10.620]  Do you prefer?
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:11.820]  I'm actually an indica guy.
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:13.900]  I'm an indica guy and I like OG cushions a lot.
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:15.100]  That's, that's pretty much what I like.
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:16.380]  I like stuff that puts me to the couch.
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:17.500]  I kind of need it nowadays.
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:22.140]  I've been doing this a really long time and I've always had a lot of strong pot around.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:23.420]  You know, that's the thing with me.
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.420]  I didn't really grow up smoking swag.
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:29.260]  I always had good homegrown, you know, and then that way I build the tolerance.
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:33.180]  See, whenever you're like 15 years old and you can outsmoke your, you know, your parents.
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:33.660]  Yeah.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:38.460]  But, um, you know, so, so it takes something like that for me, but like, like you said,
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:42.220]  like when I, when I'm working, um, if I'm doing some like, you know, heavy labor or
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:45.260]  anything like that, working in the gardens and things like that is the great, that's,
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.060]  that's when the blue dream comes out, you know?
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:52.060]  And yeah, that's pretty much my main Satiba that I will run is my Cali cut blue dream.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:52.700]  All right.
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.300]  Is that the cut that goes around this town a lot?
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:55.100]  Real tall.
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.180]  It is got the kind of nice thin blade.
[01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:57.420]  Yeah.
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:58.300]  Super, super frosty.
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:02.140]  I hit that with a grateful dog pollen and she's been called blue healer.
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:02.700]  Yeah.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:03.100]  Absolutely.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:07.420]  She does that, that, that cut does wonderful work with every, it is a true breeding cut.
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:10.700]  I can't hardly get it to, it is a hard to cut even to get the reverse.
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:11.180]  It is.
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:11.580]  Yeah.
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:12.780]  It is so stable, stable.
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.620]  You can stress it out, kick it down the street.
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:18.060]  It's going to perform every single time, no matter really what you hit it with.
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.180]  I haven't talked about this on the show and this is way off the topic that I had written,
[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:23.180]  but you guys will be two people that appreciate this.
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:26.060]  Actually, I should ask, do you work with any, uh, Feminized Seeds, bro?
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:27.020]  I do, man.
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:27.740]  Okay.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.140]  Okay.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:31.820]  Dude, I don't, I've been playing it for, I've been talking about it for probably three,
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:32.460]  four years.
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:34.460]  I don't know.
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:39.020]  I feel like it's selling out a little bit, but, but look, okay, let me clear myself.
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:45.020]  It's taken me a while to get there, but there is absolutely a purpose for it.
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:45.580]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:49.420]  As far as, I mean, totally, you know, it's undeniable, really, honestly.
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:52.860]  The reason I did it was because I wanted to replicate a strain.
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:53.340]  Absolutely.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.340]  That I didn't have a good, another cross for.
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:56.700]  I was like, I don't want to outbreed.
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:57.740]  I want to duplicate that.
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:00.940]  And so I just self did and made, that's how I made a one, one of my strains.
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:02.220]  You know what I mean?
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:02.780]  Right off the bat.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.500]  You know what I mean?
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:04.620]  So, okay.
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:05.340]  Totally, totally.
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.460]  It was definitely a reason for it.
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:07.420]  It's easy to do.
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.060]  You know what I mean?
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.900]  There's not a whole lot going on there.
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:11.740]  Just reverse a plant, you know?
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:14.140]  I don't, I don't make as near as much pollen as I do.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:15.100]  No, definitely not.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:18.380]  And that's, that's why I don't, that's you guys, that's why everybody's sold out of my
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:19.020]  seeds right now.
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.620]  Cause I can't make enough pollen.
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:21.580]  It's definitely a sacrifice.
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.780]  I've got room for all the plants.
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:25.100]  I just can't make enough pollen to hit all these plants with.
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.540]  It gets ridiculous.
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:29.340]  All right, I'm going to take a dab and then I'll tell you why I was talking about Feminized
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:29.660]  Seeds.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:32.220]  I'm honestly going to try to remember while I take this dab.
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:32.780]  Hit your head.
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.300]  Ah, there's a purpose for sure.
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:38.620]  Absolutely.
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:43.740]  You know, you know, like, like Jeff was saying, you know, it's a lot about the preservation,
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:48.460]  the preservation of colon only or, you know, say even if it's your own hybrid and you run
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:51.660]  through a hundred seeds and you find that one perfect female, that super female, you
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.740]  know, that, that, that right there, that's perfect.
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:57.100]  Perfect example of why you should Feminize that strain, stabilize it right out the gate.
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.420]  And that's what we've done with our Space Dragon.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:03.100]  As a matter of fact, it's just S1 it, give everybody the same version that we've grown
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:07.500]  to love for seven, eight years, you know, and the only way to really do that truly is
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.420]  to not outcross it is to Feminize it.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.140]  Yeah.
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.460]  And it's a lot more fun outcrossing it though, isn't it?
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:15.820]  It is because of the variety, like you were saying, the diversity of genetics to find,
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:19.420]  watch nature take over the natural selection and just watch, you know, just, just watch
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:23.020]  it take hold and really do what nature does, you know, do what nature does.
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:25.660]  I want to give a huge shout out talking about doing what nature does.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:30.940]  Gage Green Genetics is an F1 monster putting out the F1 to show in diversity.
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:34.140]  If you guys know what that means, you'll give them a shout out for that too.
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.940]  If you don't understand that you'll catch up as you listen to the show.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.740]  Gage puts out, I don't trust most F1s, but Gage's F1s are amazing.
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:42.700]  I don't know what he does.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.260]  Gage has something special going on.
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.140]  Key play in that crew.
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:50.220]  I don't know what names they want me to use, but shout out to Key play and the entire Gage
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:50.540]  Green.
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:50.780]  Mike.
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:51.180]  Yeah.
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:51.980]  We'll call him Mike.
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:52.700]  M4K.
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:54.060]  MK4.
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:54.620]  MK4.
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:55.260]  Yeah.
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.420]  But yeah, shout out to that whole crew.
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.180]  Those guys do amazing work.
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:00.140]  I look up to them a lot.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.180]  They don't really do too.
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.340]  I used to do a lot of test work for Gage Green.
[01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:06.860]  I just got done running through some eight, like seven, eight year old beans of the original
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.220]  grapes dumper release.
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:08.540]  Wow.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:13.100]  And we found a sour balls, sour balls, you know, so we're so, we're so excited about
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:13.500]  this one.
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.260]  We're going to be doing a lot of work with it soon.
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:18.220]  Gage and the Cali connection kind of put my brand on the map.
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:21.660]  They sent me free gear to run for them and let me take pictures.
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:25.420]  And then they published my pictures and high times and skunk mag and shit like that.
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:26.940]  And the guys have always been up there.
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.940]  Always seriously generous to everybody.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:32.140]  You know, even the newcomers into the game, they'll even give you a chance, you know,
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:33.660]  and give you some seeds to get started.
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:38.140]  Showed me mad love when, when we all met up at the cup, they swerve and the whole gauge
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.980]  crew, they all gave me mad, mad love.
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:43.660]  I spent most of my time at the Cali connection booth and the rest of my time at the gauge
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:43.900]  booth.
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:45.500]  Yeah.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.780]  At the camp at the cup last year.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:49.980]  So I remember what I was going to say about reversing plants.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:55.900]  I took a strain that I, so I had a plant and I selfed it and made seeds out of that.
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:57.420]  And I kept the original mommy.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:02.860]  And then I took seeds and grew the seeds until I found one that looked just like mommy.
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.620]  And then I reversed mommy again and put that pollen on this female.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.180]  And I can't get that offspring to reverse.
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.100]  I found a beautiful female that is amazing.
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:17.820]  She's been labeled GD 77 and she can't, I cannot reverse her with undiluted colloidal
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:21.180]  silver or not colloidal silver, silver thiosulfate, a hundred percent just.
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.820]  And she just looked at me like, nope.
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:24.780]  Spray it like every day.
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:25.340]  That's great, man.
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:27.500]  That's, that's a really true keeper there.
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:28.860]  That's the true breeding.
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:32.060]  But I kind of hosed myself because that's one of my breeders and I was hoping to be
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:33.180]  able to still reverse that.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.380]  So I had to go backwards.
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.140]  I had to go back to the other clone.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:36.620]  Yeah.
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:37.340]  Yeah.
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:41.900]  But yeah, that is definitely, I'm, I was told I'm one of the only breeders that's doing
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.740]  solid stress tests on my seeds.
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:49.020]  When I, before I'll breed with a female, I'll take, like, say I'm going to breed with Blue
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:49.260]  Dream.
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:53.500]  You know, I would take Blue Dream and put her in a, in a room by herself or with whatever
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:57.340]  else I'm testing and run the light cycle for two weeks the way she should and flower and
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:02.780]  then disrupt it and like turn it to the opposite and see if I can make her, her, yeah.
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:06.060]  And if you, yeah, yeah, no, then I'll use those to breed.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:09.260]  If they, if I really got to kick their ass to make them her, then I'll use them.
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:10.860]  If they hurt him too easily, I'll toss them.
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.220]  I won't even waste my time with it.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:12.780]  Yeah.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:14.940]  I don't, I don't want to put out more Herm stuff.
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:15.740]  Totally makes sense.
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:17.260]  So here's something I've talked about a couple of times.
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:18.620]  I'm way off on my notes, but this is fun.
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.900]  I just like this random chatter.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.980]  Maybe you guys will have an answer to this question.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:26.540]  I reversed a golden goat plant and I took the pollen and I put it on four other plants
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.900]  and it made great stuff.
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:32.140]  One of the plants, the headband plant shriveled up and died when the pollen hit it.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:37.100]  Like the pistols went new and it shriveled up and I went up.
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:38.540]  Straight up died, the plant died.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:39.100]  It died.
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:40.860]  I, the lights went off, the lights were going off.
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:45.500]  I pollinated right before sunset or lights out and just hit the pollen.
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:46.940]  I watched, hung out for a minute.
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.060]  You know, I was like, oh, lights are going out.
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:48.540]  I'm out of here.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:49.100]  I left the room.
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.980]  I came back the next day to see the plant was dead, bro.
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:54.460]  The other plants in the room were all, everybody was happy.
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:57.980]  Irie, everyone's getting the same treatment except that headband plant over in the corner.
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:00.060]  It was like, nope, it wasn't you.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.780]  I think I'm the only one that had access, bro.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:04.780]  Like I don't, I don't, nobody touches my breeding shit.
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:06.480]  Yeah.
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:07.440]  Yeah.
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:09.260]  I've actually never seen that.
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:10.060]  I can't say that's one.
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.180]  None of the other breeders.
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:13.900]  I've, everyone looked at me like, yeah, you did something really wrong.
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:14.940]  They're like, you fed that plant.
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.540]  That gave you straight knife shit.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:16.780]  Yeah.
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:18.700]  Something, but yeah.
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.620]  I wondered if maybe anybody has seen that.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.140]  But no, it's crazy.
[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.300]  Rob's looking at me like, holy shit, dude.
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:25.500]  Well, I'm trying it again.
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:30.460]  So in that room behind us, there's, there's a golden, a reversed golden goat in that room
[01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:31.900]  in there with headband.
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:32.380]  A headband.
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:33.100]  Yeah, he killed the headband.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:33.260]  Yeah.
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.780]  So I got headband and Gorilla Glue.
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:36.620]  They just hate each other.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:37.820]  There's a Kalonji cushion there.
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.500]  Lemon skunk too.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:42.540]  You can make some more lemon Jeffrey and then there's a whole bunch of golden goats in there
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:43.740]  to make some golden goat seeds.
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.420]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.660]  Everybody loves that lemon Jeffrey and golden goat guys.
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:48.540]  It's coming.
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:50.300]  The pollen is almost falling.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.340]  It's almost there.
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:52.460]  Nice.
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:53.500]  It's almost dropping.
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:54.940]  He's almost, what's that lemon?
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:55.980]  What's that lemon cut?
[01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:56.860]  The lemon skunk.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:58.620]  It's from Arion's greenhouse seeds.
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.700]  Just one of his, one of his fem packs a long time ago.
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:03.980]  He bought us a gift.
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:06.220]  I said, I love lemon turps and somebody bought me that pack.
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:07.180]  So I had to run it.
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:10.060]  Dude, I got the, uh, the biggest cut of that, man.
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.740]  It's supposed to be like 30 years old.
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:12.380]  Oh yeah.
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:12.700]  Yeah.
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:12.780]  Yeah.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:13.660]  Definitely.
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:14.620]  I'd hook you up.
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.580]  Dude, we'll trade some cuts.
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:18.620]  This whole table, we'll get together and we'll just order some cuts to the table.
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:18.780]  Yeah.
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.460]  That's what I feel it's really all about, man.
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:22.300]  There's too much of a shark tank out there nowadays.
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:25.020]  And you know, a lot of us that's been doing this a long time.
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.700]  There's a lot of us that started out underground.
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:30.380]  We really need to stick together and keep to those circles, you know, and help each other
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:33.900]  out and then makes less of a shark tank and more happy environment for everybody.
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:34.140]  Happy plants.
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.300]  I feel like a cheater being a Colorado breeder.
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.740]  Like, cause I, I got to cheat.
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:39.660]  You guys had to hide and do that shit.
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:41.740]  Like, yeah, but you couldn't even go to the hydro store.
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:42.460]  That's exactly it.
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:43.420]  They would follow you home from that.
[01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:43.660]  Actually.
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:44.940]  That's how my mother got busted.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:49.740]  They actually said they slid across the street over there in the East coast and they, uh,
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:51.340]  they run your tags and then that's all they need.
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.700]  They need that number and they can get it.
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:53.020]  Oh yeah.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:53.260]  Yeah.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:54.860]  And they come knock on your door.
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:57.100]  Get your name, address, what kind of insurance you have.
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.220]  So guys look out for that.
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:59.660]  You on the East coast listening.
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:25:59.980]  Yeah.
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:00.220]  Yeah.
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:00.620]  Be careful.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.580]  Don't go to the hydro store too often.
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:02.380]  Just move.
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:02.860]  Just move.
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:07.420]  Or legalize it where you are because the States that have legal cannabis are getting full and
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:08.220]  prices are going up.
[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:10.700]  Everybody's rents going up everywhere now in Colorado.
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:11.580]  So yeah, yeah.
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:15.020]  Just legalize it where you are so that that way you don't have to move here and pay 1200
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:15.980]  bucks for a small apartment.
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:19.580]  All right.
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.980]  So I'm going to ask the crazy question now.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:24.940]  How do you guys feel about auto flowering seeds?
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:25.820]  Oh, it sucks.
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:27.340]  I love you already.
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:28.780]  Me.
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:32.540]  I, I, I, I really don't, I really don't.
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:33.580]  Particularly.
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:35.500]  I really don't like to grow them myself.
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:36.700]  I have grown plenty of them.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:38.620]  I understand the breeding process of them.
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:44.140]  I have been asked to grow them and breed them, but I feel a true auto auto flower needs to be.
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:50.780]  8090 days to 120 days from start to finish and not these 60 day, 30 day, whatever they're
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:52.620]  trying to push on the market right now.
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:57.260]  There's no way for a plant to get properly mature to give you really anything worth a
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:02.140]  dime at the end of it or worth its weight in the effort that you put into that plant.
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:06.060]  When you can do the same thing, I have grown regular seeds, 12 and 12 from seed and got
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.340]  ounces off of them before.
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.380]  And that's, that's, that's faster than 90 days.
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.460]  It's faster than what an auto flower can give it to you.
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:14.780]  And you're going to not, you're not going to suffer your potency.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:15.340]  Yeah.
[01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:15.500]  Now.
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:18.780]  Per cash croppers and things like that.
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:22.060]  That's, that's probably where they're probably most appealing.
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:25.260]  Getting multiple crops or they do.
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:28.620]  I feel they do have a little bit of a place in like stealth place, like Florida places
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:29.180]  like that.
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:35.020]  You could do small grows, small little plants and do a bunch of them do feminized, you know?
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:35.340]  Yeah.
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:35.660]  Yeah.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:38.940]  And auto flowers and stay under the radar very well outdoors.
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:43.340]  There was a huge, a cartel that got busted in a national forest around here, running
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:44.620]  a bunch of auto flowers.
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:45.020]  Exactly.
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.380]  And in my opinion, that's where they originally started from auto.
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:51.740]  They wrote about waste time, just flower, you know, so they could just line them up.
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:56.940]  They did a plot of like 50 feet by 50 feet here and then wait three weeks and plot another
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:57.340]  plot.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:57.900]  Absolutely.
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:02.300]  And there's a lot of things go around online and on the internet and different hearsay
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:06.140]  about where auto flowers originally came from, whether it came from low rider, this, that,
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:06.540]  and the other.
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:07.980]  And that's really, truly where it came from.
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:12.300]  Jeff was the Mexican drug cartels and they learned how to, they started breeding their
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:14.140]  own cannabis with Kansas city ditch.
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:15.820]  We basically hemp.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:16.220]  Yeah.
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:19.180]  Root or Alice route or Alice to get us to flower automatic, automatic.
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:19.660]  Absolutely.
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:22.860]  And they figured out they could get three seasons a year in the same time and push it
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:23.020]  out.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:26.220]  And that's why the swag just became even more swag here.
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:30.140]  And to this day though, what we're seeing is a good thing.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:32.060]  You know, we were seeing the push of that away.
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:32.940]  Oh yeah.
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.860]  They're not even selling any weed anymore to America.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:37.900]  The Mexican is not even worth a dime coming over the border.
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:41.180]  It's exactly the opposite of what the government said would happen.
[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:41.740]  Yeah.
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:41.980]  Yeah.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:44.220]  They're actually, but it pissed them off.
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:47.980]  I hear that they're doing other things to like try to make more money and get back at
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:48.940]  us now because they're mad.
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:50.220]  But of course that's how they're going to roll.
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:50.460]  Right.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:52.300]  Stealing lines.
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:53.180]  I don't know.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.740]  As far as indoors, growing autos indoors.
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:59.020]  I mean, you're saving two weeks, better at beds, you know?
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:28:59.260]  Yeah.
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:28:59.420]  Right.
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:28:59.660]  Really?
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:28:59.980]  For real.
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:00.460]  Yeah.
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:04.220]  Learn to canopy management, like we've talked about on the show, but then you'll get that
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:06.540]  same weight or better phenotype selection.
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:07.100]  Absolutely.
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:07.660]  Yeah.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:08.940]  And you can't clone your auto flowers.
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:09.900]  What if you find that?
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.180]  What if you find that amazing?
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:12.220]  You're like, oh, that was fun.
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:12.940]  Totally.
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:13.980]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:18.140]  The few times I've had really great auto flowers and good experiences with auto flowers, it
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:21.580]  was, it was, it was, you know, it was great.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.620]  Now what do I do?
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:23.020]  Yeah.
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:23.500]  Yeah.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:23.980]  That was fun.
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:24.620]  Pop real seeds.
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:25.020]  Exactly.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:26.700]  There you go.
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.460]  It was like, you know, that great six for one night and then.
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:32.220]  I was going to say that, but I wasn't going to compare to that.
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:33.980]  I'm glad I let someone else use that analogy.
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:34.860]  Yeah.
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:36.860]  It's like, there's like knowing that amazing girl.
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:37.820]  We were all thinking it.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:38.060]  Yeah.
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:41.100]  I want to give you guys a shout out.
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.580]  You brought me, Rob brought me a dab shirt.
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:46.700]  I'm looking across the table and the two gentlemen, gentlemen joining me have this dab shirt.
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.140]  The logo looks sweet.
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.700]  It makes me want to take a dab every time I see that logo.
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:51.340]  It's awesome, man.
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:53.340]  I'll be rocking it one day at the cannabis cup.
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:53.820]  I appreciate that.
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:55.980]  Long cannabis cup weekend coming up.
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:56.780]  For sure.
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:57.180]  Absolutely.
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:59.420]  It really means a lot to me to have my artwork out there like that, man.
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:01.100]  And people like it, enjoy it, man.
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:02.460]  That's that really means a lot to me.
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:05.260]  There's something I agree with you when you walk through the cannabis cup and someone's
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:08.380]  wearing your logo and you don't even know, I just took a big fat puff off it.
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:08.860]  I'm holding it.
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:12.620]  When they're wearing your logo and they high five you and they're excited to see you and
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:13.820]  you're like, I just made a friend.
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:15.340]  It's a really great experience.
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:15.900]  Yeah.
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:17.420]  I look forward to meeting you guys at the cannabis cup.
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:18.060]  People walk up.
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:20.620]  If you, if you know me, if you listen to the show, walk up, high five me.
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.420]  I've got some platinum OG dabs.
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:25.100]  I've got some black cherry chem dabs.
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:27.660]  I have some Jeff's OG dabs and I'm taking to the cup with me.
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:31.020]  If you find me at the right time, if I'm not out, I'll dab you out.
[01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:32.620]  Chances are, I won't have any seeds with me.
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:36.620]  There's a private party Friday night and they're going to be gone before I even leave that
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:37.420]  party.
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:37.980]  Sorry, y'all.
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:39.740]  But that's what we do.
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:43.500]  So you guys, you're both from different States.
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.860]  You grew in other States where it was crazy.
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:51.020]  And now you came here and you're able to set up shop and grow and do your breeding thing.
[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:52.700]  And I know that's a lot less stressful.
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:57.180]  The breeding laws here, it's kind of gray area in the breeding, but they keep changing
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:59.020]  the rules everywhere we move to grow.
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:00.060]  They keep changing the rules.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.100]  Is that messing you guys up?
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.060]  No, not at all.
[01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:03.500]  No, I'm from Virginia.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:06.700]  So no matter what happens here, I'm good.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:07.500]  You know what I mean?
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:08.380]  No matter what.
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:08.780]  There you go.
[01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:12.780]  I think, I think what it really boils down to when it, like he's saying, you know, when
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:15.500]  you're a true grower, nothing's going to stop you doing what you love.
[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:15.820]  Yeah.
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:17.660]  I, well, I totally agree with that.
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:18.620]  Totally agree with that.
[01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:23.020]  I think that not just cannabis or growing it, I think it goes for all levels.
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:26.220]  If something that you really love to do, regardless of who is the government to tell you that
[01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:27.260]  you can't, cannot do nothing.
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:28.380]  I could, I could never stop.
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:31.900]  But it's, it's, it's really not going to affect me.
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:35.980]  I'm I'm I'm out in the County, things like that.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:39.260]  So I really don't have to worry about the new, but the ordinance is now with the, uh,
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:43.660]  you know, like Pueblo, no more outdoor growing city limits.
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:44.620]  Yeah.
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.860]  You can't grow outdoors in our city limits at all.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:47.260]  Yeah.
[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:51.820]  That was killed by a couple of specific growers because they had the dank outside and they just
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:55.180]  had six foot tall plants over the fence that smelled all the way down to the high school,
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:56.140]  down the street.
[01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:57.820]  So that pissed off kind of a few people.
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:58.540]  That sucks.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:01.100]  Here's a question I've never asked anybody on the show.
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:04.780]  If you had to pick one, either growing or smoking cannabis.
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:05.260]  Growing.
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:06.780]  Absolutely.
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:07.580]  I agree.
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:08.380]  I agree.
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:08.940]  Growing.
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:09.500]  Yep.
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:10.540]  That's so awesome.
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:13.020]  I'm glad that that means we're all in this right thing for you.
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:13.580]  Yeah.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:14.620]  We're all in it with our hearts.
[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:15.500]  I love that.
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.180]  You guys didn't even have to think about it.
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:18.140]  Absolutely not.
[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:19.340]  That is so cool.
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:22.700]  If even if I couldn't smoke cannabis and my lungs gave out tomorrow or somewhere,
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.940]  some crazy reason that I couldn't smoke cannabis.
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:25.740]  Who cares about smoking?
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.980]  It's still, it's not, it's a learning tool.
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:29.180]  It's, it's, it's a fun experience.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:31.420]  It's like Jeff, you usually play drums.
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:37.020]  Um, it's, it's that release, that release that you get and it's your energy going into a good
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:39.820]  thing, you know, and you can help other people.
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:40.380]  Exactly.
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:43.500]  I can be in the worst mood and I don't usually get in a bad mood.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:44.460]  It's like fishing.
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:44.940]  Yeah, dude.
[01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:45.100]  Yeah.
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:48.300]  A bad day in the garden is better than a good day at most other things.
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:48.700]  Exactly.
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:52.540]  You know, I can just go in the garden and just, there's always something to do and you just go
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:56.060]  in there and next thing you know, it's been 30 or 40 minutes and you're more, you're just.
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:57.420]  You wish you had another hour.
[01:32:57.420 --> 01:32:58.140]  Yeah.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:32:59.100]  You just want to hang out.
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.260]  You got some, you got a podcast on.
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:04.460]  Hopefully you're listening to the grow from your heart podcast or some good reggae music.
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:09.020]  And you're just in there taking off the dead leaves or just tilling the top soil or just
[01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:09.740]  staring.
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:13.340]  I catch myself just almost masturbating to the garden.
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:17.340]  Just like, I want to buy him drinks and throw dollars at him.
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:19.180]  I'm like, these ladies are so beautiful.
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:25.180]  Yeah, guys, if you understand what I'm saying, you're listening to the right podcast.
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:25.820]  That's right.
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:27.260]  That's, that's what growing is all about.
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:31.180]  If you want to throw a dollar bills at your sexy plants, you're growing some sexy bitches.
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.140]  Stripper OG.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.260]  I'm claiming the name right now.
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:34.140]  Jeff's OG.
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:34.700]  Got it.
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:35.740]  Stripper OG.
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:36.380]  We're taking it.
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:37.660]  It's good shit, dude.
[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:39.900]  Um, so we've been going about 36 minutes on that.
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:40.620]  I'm glad you approved.
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:40.940]  Thank you.
[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:41.580]  Thank you.
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:42.620]  It was very excellent, man.
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:45.980]  It might've dried up a little more than I wanted, but, uh, awesome.
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:46.620]  Thank you.
[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:47.100]  Cool.
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:47.340]  Cool.
[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:48.140]  I appreciate that.
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.820]  If you guys approve, then that means it's good.
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:50.140]  Sure.
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:50.700]  Good shit.
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:51.420]  Absolutely.
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:57.020]  Uh, where can someone find other than, uh, nature's green remedies.com and the cannabis
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.380]  cup this fall?
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:33:59.820]  Where can people find your seeds, man?
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:02.300]  Me, mine, mine, mine will just be there.
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:06.220]  The cannabis cup, uh, nature's green remedies and, uh, you'll find us at the seven 10 cup
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:06.620]  this year.
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:08.220]  710 cup in Colorado.
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:08.940]  I will be there.
[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:09.900]  Yeah.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:10.460]  How about yourself?
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:16.140]  Uh, will the seeds get to us if we order them from attitude right now?
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:16.700]  Yeah.
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:17.100]  Okay.
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:18.220]  There's a lot of speculation.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.020]  So you heard right here.
[01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:21.260]  I haven't heard seeds from them in a while, but you heard it right there, guys.
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:24.060]  Can of interest says you can get them from the to order them up.
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.580]  You got a coupon code or anything?
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:26.060]  No, I don't.
[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:26.620]  All right.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:27.100]  I got a thing.
[01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:28.780]  I got a promo going on there though, man.
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:29.500]  Some free seeds.
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:30.380]  I'll Google it right now.
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:31.180]  We'll check it out.
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:33.260]  I think 80% on some triple Nova pack.
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:35.980]  This is going to go up like a week before the cannabis cup.
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.140]  I think this will be up April 13th ish.
[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:39.100]  So people will hear it.
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:42.380]  Um, we're going to have, then we'll have a really cool cannabis cup episode.
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:43.180]  So I'm loading the webpage.
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:44.780]  We'll go to the attitude seed bank right now.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:45.980]  I haven't gone here in a long time.
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:46.620]  Yeah.
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:49.980]  I haven't, you know, I think I got some free seeds on there too.
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:50.940]  Uh, we'll check it out.
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.460]  We'll give you a proper shout out on there.
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:55.180]  I could have done some pre-show research, but I don't even know.
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.380]  These companies change so often that it's hard to tell.
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:01.660]  I don't keep track of sales.
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:03.340]  I don't keep track of, no, I just send seeds.
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:05.900]  I take orders since he's, I don't, I don't, I don't even check it.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:08.300]  Uh, I play the, I don't know role.
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:08.940]  I don't know, man.
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.940]  Somehow seeds end up at nature's green remedies.
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:13.180]  And they handle all that for me.
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:14.940]  Yeah.
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:15.820]  I don't do sales.
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:17.340]  They do Bitcoin now.
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:18.940]  I'm not advertising so much for them.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:20.780]  And yeah, no, I heard attitude.
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:21.980]  Uh, I don't know, man.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:24.300]  I heard they stopped doing credit cards, doing Bitcoin.
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:25.340]  Wow.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:25.580]  Yeah.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:26.700]  It looks like, wow.
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:27.200]  Yeah.
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:28.380]  Yeah.
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.900]  And then they show you how to get the Bitcoins too.
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:33.900]  So that maybe they're trying to change it, but, um, no, you do not have a promo this month.
[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:37.100]  No, no, not on the front page, but still guys support that spot.
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:37.900]  Cause it's cool.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:42.780]  As long as they, uh, as long as you pay for the fucking guaranteed shipping, that's it works.
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:43.020]  Yeah.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:43.420]  Pay.
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:44.540]  That's what you have to do.
[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:45.100]  Exactly.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:46.380]  You get a shirt out of it.
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:46.860]  Yeah.
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:47.980]  You get a cool, get a mug.
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:51.100]  I recommend getting a mug because they sent me a really cool DNA genetics mug.
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:53.020]  And I passed that on as a Christmas gift.
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:53.500]  Awesome.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:53.660]  Yeah.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.020]  The shirts aren't as cool as the mugs.
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:55.660]  No, they're not.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:56.860]  I got a Dr.
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:57.500]  Moon shirt.
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:35:59.580]  Some weird shit.
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:00.140]  Yeah.
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:00.380]  Yeah.
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:02.060]  I got one with like some
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:04.860]  hell Betty looking chick.
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:09.980]  It looked really obscene, but I just wrapped other stuff up in it and sent it on.
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:13.420]  So what's coming up in the future for, uh, for sour seeds,
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:15.900]  Lots, lots, lots in the future.
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:18.860]  Uh, we plan to go, I say worldwide by the end of the year.
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:23.500]  Um, as long as we can keep up with the demand and really do well this year, we're going to do a big
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:26.220]  tour and we're going to have a lot of just, we're just going to go out there and have fun with it,
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:26.380]  man.
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:27.100]  And do what I do.
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:29.660]  Is there any plan to get your seeds on shelves in Colorado?
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:30.300]  Absolutely.
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:31.020]  Absolutely.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:34.380]  That's, that's a big, big, big thing for us to, um, at the end of the year,
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:37.980]  and going to go with our own medically infused products license.
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:40.780]  Um, I have 40 acres in Colorado city, a one agricultural,
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:42.460]  so we're going to go big.
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:43.180]  We're going to do it right.
[01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:46.940]  You know, and, and it's just going to grow and grow from there.
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:49.580]  And, uh, we're also starting our own clothing company.
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:52.220]  A high life apparel should be coming out soon.
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:53.740]  Um, stuff looks good guys.
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:55.020]  They brought me a t-shirt and I love it.
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:56.780]  And, uh, yeah, thanks man.
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:59.100]  And, and, and, you know, it's just all custom done designs.
[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:03.900]  Um, anyone's welcome to bring a design and if we can print it and you like it and other
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:05.740]  people like it, we'll print it.
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:07.820]  You know, that, that's what it's all about.
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:08.700]  It's like local artists.
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:11.820]  That's what I want to bring you to that whole scene as local art design being worn at the
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:13.100]  cannabis cut by one of us.
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:13.260]  Yeah.
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:13.980]  That's so awesome.
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:16.140]  You know, and then, and then that's, it's, it's a good feeling, man.
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:18.780]  It really is a good, good feeling to get your artwork out there and just,
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:19.980]  just to have it seen by others.
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:22.860]  And you never know, you could be the next greatest artist in the world.
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:26.940]  And you never know what tomorrow can hold for a person that just drives himself to do things.
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:27.740]  That's the truth.
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:28.700]  This guy speaks the truth.
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:29.580]  Y'all Mr.
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:32.780]  Canaventure what's coming up in the future, my friend, nothing, nothing.
[01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.700]  You guys just chilling, just done, done.
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:35.500]  You giving it up.
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.580]  Just going to keep smoking pot and see what happens.
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:45.340]  It's wearing a sweater and a car, a cardigan.
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:45.500]  Yeah.
[01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:46.380]  I couldn't think of the property.
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:50.700]  You can tell he's been in the industry a lot longer than he's already comfortable.
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:52.220]  He's just like, I'm just gonna smoke pot.
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:54.940]  It's like, I'm gonna take some dads and see what those guys figured out.
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:55.100]  Yeah.
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:57.900]  I'm going to put some pollen on some plants, take some seeds out.
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:37:59.580]  Those to the attitude.
[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:03.420]  Take another dab.
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:04.860]  Done.
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:07.260]  Nah, it's been cool, man.
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:08.380]  You guys, you see how that works?
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:11.100]  Just fucking let some shit go like that guy just did.
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:12.380]  Why can't we all do that?
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:13.660]  That's so easy, man.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:16.140]  I can tell, I can tell we were going to have fun the minute you walked in.
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:16.460]  Oh yeah.
[01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:17.500]  Rest is great care.
[01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:17.740]  Yeah.
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:19.340]  I made a friend for life.
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:24.460]  So I see like a clone trading session and possibly I'm going to kind of say collab.
[01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:24.940]  Oh dude.
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:26.540]  You know, let's do something.
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:27.020]  Yeah.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:29.660]  We've actually been talking about doing some clavis stuff like that.
[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:33.100]  Who's got, who's got the best mail, the best steady mail.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:33.260]  Dude.
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:34.380]  I got a lot of shit.
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:34.860]  Yeah, I do.
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:35.980]  I definitely miss for sure.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:37.020]  He's definitely got a lot.
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:41.260]  And I don't know my mail, my mail is pretty, I got some pretty good mails that I have that,
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:44.620]  that Kim D back cross mail and it does wonderful work.
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:47.500]  It's almost identical replica to the original Kim dog.
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:50.700]  D I mean, you look at them side by side and it's hard to tell which one is the mail,
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:51.660]  which one's to be male.
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:56.060]  I mean, in veg, you couldn't really tell between the two, but we can do a lot of cool things with
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:56.700]  that.
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:58.540]  It, it, it's going to do a lot of great work.
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:05.020]  We have a new sour alien dog coming out and it's a basically an alien OG white fire and
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:09.260]  that Kim dog D so keep on the lookout guys.
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:10.140]  Sour seeds is coming up.
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:11.340]  They're going to be putting out some fire shit.
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:14.940]  It sounds like absolutely that fix it.
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:15.180]  Yeah.
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:18.060]  See, I told you guys, I'm going to do another shout out on this piece of equipment.
[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:20.700]  The live wire solutions, HAO four.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:21.420]  It's a piece of shit.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.300]  Don't ever buy one.
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:26.860]  That sound you heard was me smacking on it to make it work properly to bring Rusty's
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:31.660]  channel back in by the same people that brought you Nintendo.
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:32.940]  Is that, is it probably?
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:33.260]  I don't know.
[01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:34.300]  We can't say that.
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:34.620]  It's great.
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.340]  Right.
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:35.740]  All right.
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:37.660]  I'm going to start closing up the show.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.500]  Uh, where can people find you online?
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:40.620]  Do you have like a website or something?
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:42.300]  Yeah, we do.
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:45.260]  Mile high dank.co mile high dank.co.
[01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:47.660]  Do you have an Instagram page right now?
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:47.900]  Yes.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:49.500]  Sour Cico sour seed coach.
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:50.140]  Check them out there guys.
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:51.020]  Follow them on Instagram.
[01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:51.820]  How about a Twitter?
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:53.100]  Not Twitter yet.
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:53.580]  Twitter.
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:54.220]  Not on the Twitter.
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:56.380]  You have a forum on your website also, don't you?
[01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:56.620]  Yeah.
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:56.860]  Yeah.
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:57.820]  Our whole web forum.
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:39:58.940]  That's basically what it is.
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:00.940]  It's just a straight up web forum.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:05.100]  Uh, you know, anybody's welcome to join growers, helping growers, you know, anybody we can,
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:06.460]  we can lend you a hand if you need it.
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:11.180]  And, uh, we look to see a lot of our own genetics and we have Rasta Jeff on there.
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:12.700]  We have a can of venture on there.
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:15.660]  So, you know, we just want to, we want to see our genetics online.
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:18.300]  We want to see what you get out of our genetics and how much you do.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.740]  And how does that feel, man?
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:23.900]  When you just scroll through a website and see somebody killing it with your creations,
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:24.860]  that is, that's the greatest thing.
[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:27.500]  It's just like another piece of artwork, you know, just it was anything else.
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:28.540]  It's all a work of art.
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:29.100]  Yeah.
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:30.220]  It makes you like a proud papa.
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:31.660]  Oh, that's a trophy man.
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:34.220]  At the end of the day, you know, that's what, that's really what it's all about.
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:37.180]  I feel like the breeder should be able to grow the shit out of his creation.
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:40.140]  But when you send those seeds to just somebody else, somebody buys them, you don't even know
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:40.860]  who the hell they are.
[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:41.500]  And they kill it.
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.660]  You're like, oh man, that means I did that stream.
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:44.220]  Right.
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:47.260]  Then like you were saying about F1 seeds, that's a lot of like what we do too.
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:51.420]  At the same time as with Gage Green and a lot of the other guys, um, that's your chance
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:52.060]  to find a clone.
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:53.020]  Only what he has.
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:53.420]  Yeah.
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:54.140]  For sure.
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:56.220]  That's your chance to find that gym, that Holy grail.
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:56.620]  Yep.
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:58.620]  Big shout out to Van Bear.
[01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:01.020]  Uh, he killed it with some of my double eyes.
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.980]  I can't see the plant through the trichomes and it looks great.
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:05.420]  And he did it with LEDs.
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:05.980]  Oh wow.
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:06.220]  Yeah.
[01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:06.380]  Yeah.
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:07.580]  Which is actually impressive.
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:10.380]  A lot of people diss on the LEDs and he killed it with those.
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:11.500]  At least it looks like LEDs.
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:12.780]  All his pics are purple in the background.
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:13.980]  So I'm assuming it's LEDs.
[01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:14.540]  Sure.
[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:14.700]  Yeah.
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:15.100]  It looks great.
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:16.220]  Like Van Bear.
[01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:16.700]  Yeah.
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:17.660]  Well, he's on my forum.
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:22.220]  He's on, if you go to IREGIONXCOLORADO.COM, there's a forum and I'll check out your guys'
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:25.020]  forum a little more often and you guys go to mine and we'll all check out Van Bear's
[01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:25.500]  pictures.
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:26.860]  See the killer work he did.
[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:27.420]  Awesome.
[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:27.740]  Awesome.
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:28.300]  Yeah.
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:30.700]  I'm working with a combination of LED and high percent sodium.
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:31.500]  I really like it.
[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:35.340]  That's what I've been rolling with a little while now and it does, it does work, man.
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:35.900]  It looks good.
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:36.620]  Well, would you, Rod?
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:37.180]  Smells good.
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:40.460]  We only took a couple puffs because everybody got lit.
[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:40.700]  Yeah.
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:44.540]  This was, uh, unfortunately this was, you know, seed, seed weed, but, uh,
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:50.460]  Do you guys feel like the, uh, seeded plants make a different kind of a cannabinoid spectrum?
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:52.140]  Oh, that's a cool looking line.
[01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:52.700]  Absolutely.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:56.620]  I feel that most of the plants full potential is going to make an offspring.
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:56.780]  Yeah.
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:59.260]  Whoever did that room, whoever set that room up, it's a high five.
[01:41:59.260 --> 01:41:59.740]  Yeah, man.
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.100]  All those LEDs, nice.
[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:01.420]  Yeah.
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:02.380]  Fucking legit, dude.
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:02.860]  Seriously.
[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:07.340]  So I completely think that, uh, we make hash out of all the plants that I run that have
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:07.820]  seeds in them.
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:10.380]  We just pull the seeds out and make hash out of all of it because why not?
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.500]  Do you pull all the seeds out?
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:12.780]  All of them.
[01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:13.900]  Well, we just, the way we do it.
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:14.300]  Yeah.
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:14.780]  Yeah.
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:16.460]  Even though it mostly come out.
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:16.700]  Yeah.
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:17.820]  It tastes weird, man.
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:18.060]  Yeah.
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:18.380]  Yeah.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:18.460]  Yeah.
[01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:18.860]  Definitely.
[01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:19.100]  Yeah.
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:21.180]  But that hash gets you higher.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:23.980]  It gets you a different, it's like a full body high.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:27.980]  You get the head high, the body high, the eye high, you get cotton mouth.
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:31.660]  It seems like all those cannabinoids are in there when you let the plant seed itself.
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:32.460]  I don't talk about that.
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:33.500]  Look at my fingers.
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:33.660]  Yeah.
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:34.460]  What are you been doing, man?
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:35.340]  Plucking seeds.
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:35.820]  Oh, nice.
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:37.820]  He's all black fingered over here.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.320]  Yeah.
[01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:42.620]  I got rubber.
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:43.580]  I got rubber gloves, bro.
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:44.860]  You want a couple of those?
[01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:50.220]  Speaking of raw dog, do you guys have a website?
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:50.700]  Oh yeah.
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:53.340]  Actually, it's being redesigned, but we got a forum.
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:57.340]  Sign up to that forum for free weekly giveaways.
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:57.980]  Cool.

[01:42:58.220 --> 01:42:59.020]  Get some free shit.
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:42:59.500]  Yeah.
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.100]  Cannabis is a little ahead of the game on us.
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:03.180]  Oh man, I wouldn't say that.
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:05.420]  Just been around a little longer.
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:05.660]  Yeah.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:07.580]  Well, we're all hanging out now.
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:08.380]  We're going to collab, dude.
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:08.860]  I can't wait.
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:11.100]  We're going to, we're going to use that Kim D mail.
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:12.860]  Then the two of us will throw in a female.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:13.340]  Good.
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:14.300]  Oh, that room looks sexy.
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:14.940]  What's that spot?
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:16.460]  Seven seven seven.
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:17.180]  Looks really good.
[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:17.580]  I like that.
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:17.740]  Nice.
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:18.620]  And it was organized.
[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:22.060]  My room is sad right now because my flowering room is totally empty.
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:24.780]  And cause that fucking female killed that motherfucker.
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:30.940]  Oh yeah.
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:31.660]  Murder.
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:33.340]  No, I just, I just chopped it.
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:33.980]  It's looking pretty good.
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:34.460]  It's hanging on.
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:35.340]  It's all upside down now.
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:36.860]  So it's anti-gravity weed.
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:37.260]  Pretty soon.
[01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:38.140]  It'll be some great medicine.
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:39.020]  I'll have some Tora Bora.
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:39.980]  They'll heal a lot of people.
[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:42.140]  It'll be great.
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:43.100]  Topsy turvy.
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:44.940]  I just can't have it.
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:45.980]  You're having Instagram.
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:46.940]  Oh no, no.
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:47.980]  You don't seem like an Instagram.
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:48.620]  You know what, man?
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:52.220]  I got a Twitter account and I can't even tell you what it is.
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:54.220]  Well, somebody out there will find it.
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:57.260]  Somebody listening will tell you, and they'll be like, here it is.
[01:43:57.260 --> 01:43:57.980]  That's pretty bad.
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:43:58.860]  Do you want to go trip?
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:43:59.500]  Trip?
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:00.620]  Oh, that's my Twitter account.
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:05.020]  I guess what's getting bad when you can Google your own name and that's in you.
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:08.940]  You got like 1 jillion hits, you know, it's a different things pop up.
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:09.340]  Yeah.
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:10.700]  I try not to look too much at that.
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:11.660]  No, definitely.
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:14.860]  I was going to tell these guys toward the end of the show, how many people listen to this podcast?
[01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:17.180]  Do either of you have a guess how many people hear my little show?
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:20.620]  I really don't.
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:21.820]  I listen to your show.
[01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:28.460]  Within 48 hours of the posting of on iTunes and Stitcher, 5,000 people will have heard this show.
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:28.940]  Nice.
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:32.460]  Within a week, about 7,500 people will hear the show.
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:33.260]  Hey, it's nice.
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:35.100]  It's pro shit for real.
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:36.300]  Well, thanks everybody out there.
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:36.620]  Yeah.
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:37.100]  Thanks for it.
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:37.820]  For real, it really is.
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:40.380]  These guys walked in and they're like, this is some pro shit, man.
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:41.180]  That's right, man.
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:43.420]  That's some mics and a computer, but I appreciate it.
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:43.900]  Thanks guys.
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:48.300]  What are these for, man?
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:48.860]  So you can hear.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:49.980]  Now, doesn't it sound a lot better?
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:50.540]  It does.
[01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:51.980]  It sounds so pro, dude.
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:52.300]  It does.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:52.540]  Yeah.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:53.580]  All right.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:55.260]  I love bullshitting with these guys, but I should wrap it up.
[01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:57.980]  You guys only tend to listen to about 45 minutes and we're at 47.
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:44:58.780]  So let's do this.
[01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:00.940]  Everybody, thanks for listening to another episode.
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:02.620]  I will be back in a week.
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:03.980]  It'll be the Cannabis Cup episode.
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:05.340]  So I've got to pre-record some shit.
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:06.460]  I'm going to hit this joint.
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:06.940]  Yeah.
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:07.980]  I want to hit that right quick.
[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:11.020]  I appreciate the invitation, dude, for real.
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:11.260]  Yeah.
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:12.300]  Oh, man, you guys are welcome back.
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:13.020]  Anytime.
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:13.980]  You don't have to come together.
[01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:14.700]  You can come together.
[01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:15.340]  I'm moving in, right?
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:15.980]  Someone else.
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:17.100]  Didn't you get a free room here?
[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:17.580]  Do it, bro.
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:18.060]  Use that room.
[01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:18.940]  You know how to trim, right?
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:19.180]  Yep.
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:19.660]  We're good.
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:20.300]  You're in, dude.
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:21.020]  A full-time trimmer.
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:21.980]  You know how to pluck seeds?
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:23.340]  Duh.
[01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:24.380]  Guy on the couch.
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:25.180]  Guy on the couch.
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:26.700]  All right.
[01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:28.300]  So the next episode will be the Cup episode.
[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:32.300]  I got to pre-record something, but dude, after that, I get to come to a Cup review episode,
[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.740]  which is going to be pretty awesome.
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:35.740]  If you see me or my friends at the Cup, come give me a hug.

[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:51.020]  That is really cool.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:52.060]  I appreciate that.
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:54.060]  We're getting donations on the donation page.
[01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:57.260]  Yeah, that's pretty much what I've got to say for today.
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:59.260]  I want to say a big, huge shout out to these guys for coming.
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:46:59.660]  They took time.
[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:00.940]  They're breeders and growers.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:02.380]  He's obviously plucking seeds.
[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:03.820]  His fingers are black as shit.
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:07.900]  You guys had to take time out of real work to come over here and help me out.
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:08.300]  I do.
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:08.940]  Thank you, man.
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:10.220]  You guys are welcome back anytime.
[01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:10.780]  Thank you, brother.
[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:13.820]  If you're out there and you're a grower in Colorado or if you've got something to say
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:16.940]  about cannabis and you want to be on a show, send me an email because somebody told me
[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:19.340]  they wanted to be on the show and they're like, would you even have me?
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:20.220]  Fuck yeah, I have you, dude.
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:21.180]  I want to know what you have to say.
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:25.420]  There may be like a pre-interview before I bring you to my recording area and dab you
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:25.580]  out.
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:27.900]  You know, might meet you at the Walmart or some shit.
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:35.900]  But you know, if you're not a fed and psychotic, there's a pretty good chance you can come
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:36.860]  be on the show.
[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:38.380]  So yeah, send me an email.
[01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:39.900]  Text me if you know how to do that.
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:40.300]  Whatever.
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:41.740]  Yeah.
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:42.060]  All right.
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:43.900]  I want to give a huge, huge shout out to my ninja spits.
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:44.780]  Thanks again for listening.
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:47.980]  Until next time, take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:05.620]  Yeah.
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:07.380]  Happy 420 podcast world.
[01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:10.100]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:13.380]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:14.980]  This is episode number 64.
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:16.020]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:17.460]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:20.660]  As always, I want to send a big thank you shout out to the mystic roots man for letting
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:22.260]  me use their music on my show.
[01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:25.940]  Big thanks to cat coop and the entire mystic roots crew.
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:27.220]  Happy 420 everybody.
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:30.660]  While you guys are listening to this, I'm probably running around with the cannabis cup,
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:34.020]  getting a sunburn, getting dabbed out, shaking hands, rubbing elbows.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:35.700]  Hope a lot of you guys made it out to the cup.
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:36.980]  I hope you had a safe 420.
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:38.420]  Hope you had a happy 420.
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:40.180]  Hope everything went your way.
[01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.340]  I hope you smoked on some delicious dank.
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:44.260]  We've got a couple of news articles.
[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:47.060]  I want to read, want to talk about a letter that somebody sent me.
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:51.780]  I want to talk about a letter that the MED has sent out to businesses in Colorado regarding
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:52.580]  the cannabis cup.
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:57.060]  But before we get that far, I do need to pay a couple of bills.

[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:25.540]  All right.
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:28.580]  I'm going to turn down some music here and we're going to get into a couple of things.
[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:34.420]  The first thing I want to talk about is Hitman Dougie posted a thing to Instagrams where
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:35.860]  I discovered this.
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:38.100]  It's a two page letter.
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:40.260]  Sorry, I'm pulling out the article while I talk here.
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:41.140]  It's a two page letter.
[01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.820]  It was sent to all of the...
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:46.020]  I'm going to say MED a lot here.
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:49.140]  The MED stands for Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:54.100]  The Marijuana Enforcement Division sent this letter to every business in Colorado that
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:58.980]  is regulated and registered with the Marijuana Enforcement Division, which includes every
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:05.060]  dispensary, every edible manufacturing company, every extract making company.
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:10.260]  Just about anything involved in the marijuana industry is covered by these guys.
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:10.820]  Everything is.
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:13.140]  If you're doing it legally, these guys are in your shit.
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:19.220]  So they sent out a letter regarding the Cannabis Cup to remind the businesses...
[01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:20.900]  I'm going to just kind of read it.
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:25.860]  It says regarding licensee participation in off-premise cannabis events, trade shows,
[01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:26.900]  and festivals.
[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:32.580]  The letter says this, Dear Colorado Marijuana Industry Members, as the operator of a medical
[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:37.140]  marijuana business and or retail marijuana establishment, you hold a privileged license
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:39.060]  issued by the state licensing authority.
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:44.180]  Your facility must be operated strictly within the law set forth by the Colorado Constitution,
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:47.860]  Colorado revised statutes, and the Colorado Code of Regulations.
[01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:52.820]  The Marijuana Enforcement Division, which is the MED, is responsible for ensuring licensees
[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:54.260]  fully comply with these laws.
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:59.380]  While licensees may be aware of the legal requirements on the licensed premises, high
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:04.260]  profile cannabis events, trade shows, industry marketing, and festivals around the state
[01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:09.220]  generate a number of inquiries to MED about what business or establishment related activity
[01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:11.620]  may be permissible off the licensed premise.
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:17.780]  Typically, those inquiries focus on whether an owner or their employee may transport medical
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:23.220]  marijuana or retail marijuana, flower or products from licensed premises to such events for
[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:28.820]  marketing and promotional purposes, for display, providing samples, competitions, sales, or
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:29.940]  donations, etc.
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:34.980]  Statute clearly mandates that marijuana produced within regulated system must remain in the
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:40.580]  closed system and only transported between MED licensed premises until final sale to
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:45.140]  a patient or customer and may not be consumed within any licensed premises.
[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:52.100]  No owner or employee may enjoy the privileges provided by a MED business license, the ability
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:56.500]  to lawfully cultivate, process, and sell marijuana within the state of Colorado at
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:57.780]  any off-premise site.
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:03.540]  Medical or retail marijuana licensee owners or employees should not use personally purchased
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:07.940]  flower or product as a means to avoid the intent of the statute and regulation prohibiting
[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:10.340]  off-premise display and sale of marijuana.
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:16.420]  Colorado statute and rule does not preclude a MED licensee from participating at an event,
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:22.020]  trade show, or festival off-premises in order to distribute coupons, display graphics, or
[01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:23.700]  handout printed material.
[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:24.820]  All right, this is a two-page article.
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:28.580]  I have to click back a couple pages to find page two because I just found this on Hitman
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:29.780]  Glass Duggee's Instagram.
[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:31.940]  So I'm reading a picture of this letter, honestly.
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:34.420]  But I want to recap kind of what part of this says.
[01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:38.100]  They're saying basically that...
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:39.060]  Oh, that music's still playing.
[01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:39.460]  There we go.
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:46.660]  They're saying that you can't take your cannabis that was produced in a dispensary grow to
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:50.660]  these events and share it, smoke it, consume it, and show it off at these events.
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:54.420]  It has to stay in the confines of that regulated building.
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:54:01.540]  So they can't take that cannabis there, which means the dispensaries, the large dispensaries
[01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:05.700]  that have paid a lot of money for booths cannot go display their product.
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:10.260]  Typically, these booths would be smoking you down with dabs.
[01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:11.940]  They'd be smoking you down with flowers.
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:13.300]  There would be a line.
[01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:17.140]  You would get to taste all of the major dispensaries in Colorado's products.
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:19.860]  Now the MED is saying, no, you cannot do that.
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:24.900]  They have also said that they're going to be there in force to enforce this, to make
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:25.620]  sure this happens.
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:26.500]  That's not in this letter.
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.420]  That's just the talk around this letter.
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:30.820]  They have verified, yes, we're not fucking around.
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:33.540]  We're coming to kind of put some pressure on you.
[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:35.060]  Then there's that short paragraph.
[01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:39.860]  Medical or retail marijuana licensee owners or employees should not use personally purchased
[01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:44.420]  flower or products as a mean to avoid the intent of the statute and regulation prohibiting
[01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:47.220]  off-premises display and sale of marijuana.
[01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:50.500]  Now that sounds like a lot of weirdness if you don't catch on to what that says.
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:56.980]  That means that if a dispensary owner knows a private grower, like myself, I'm a private
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:54:57.300]  grower.
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:58.660]  I have a private caregiver grow.
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:05.300]  He cannot buy a pound of product from me and put it in his dispensary display at the cannabis
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:05.460]  cup.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:06.420]  He cannot do that.
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:12.100]  Should not use personally purchased flower or product as a means to avoid the intent.
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:18.260]  So if they find product there, they're going to be upset about it.
[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:22.900]  You're going to be in violation some way because you're violating either the transportation law
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:27.540]  and taking it out of the closed system that they have invented here, or you're going to
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:32.020]  be in violation because you have now purchased some outside system cannabis and brought it
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:32.660]  into the system.
[01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:34.580]  So they're definitely going to find a way to screw us.
[01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:35.380]  Let me find page two.
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:36.980]  That's what I'm kind of stumbling into here.
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:37.780]  There we go.
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:38.100]  All right.
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:41.620]  Oh, there was another paragraph on the end of page one that I have to start with.
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:42.500]  Let's find that.
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:50.980]  In order to diminish the potential for improper conduct at an event or festival, Colorado
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:56.180]  licensees are strongly encouraged to locate any booth or exhibit table in an area away
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:56:02.420]  from separated in an area away from and separated from any area designated for consumption of
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:03.460]  marijuana.
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:08.900]  Similarly, licensees are encouraged to avoid any participation in which the licensee might
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:12.580]  appear to be facilitating potentially illegal conduct.
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:16.180]  So they know that there's going to be consumption at some of these events, and they're saying
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:23.140]  that they want you, if you are an MED regulated business, you need to be locate any booth
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:29.700]  or exhibit table in any area away from and separated from any area designated for consumption.
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:32.660]  So they're pretty much saying, get the fuck away from all the cannabis stuff where people
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:34.660]  are smoking, go far, far away from that.
[01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:41.780]  The last I heard High Times canceled the medical portion of their party at the Cannabis
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:46.740]  Cup this year because they're putting this pressure on it and they couldn't get enough
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:49.380]  medical entries is what somebody told me is why they were doing it.
[01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:50.580]  This kind of makes sense now.
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:55.940]  What they used to do was they would have a special building designated just for the medical
[01:56:55.940 --> 01:56:56.340]  entries.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:59.380]  And it doesn't seem like they're doing that now, but I'm going to keep reading this.
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:05.060]  A pursuant to CRS 12-43.3-901.
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:06.180]  Do you guys really want to hear all these numbers?
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:06.980]  I'm going to skip that.
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:11.140]  It is unlawful for a person to buy, sell, transfer, give away, or acquire medical marijuana,
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:16.180]  retail marijuana, or retail marijuana products except as allowed pursuant to these articles
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:20.580]  or section 16 of article Roman numerals of the state constitution.
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:22.180]  Sorry, I'm trying to get past that part quickly.
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:27.460]  Conduct outside of the protections of the license and regulated market under CRS title
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:32.740]  12 or authorized under amendments 20 or 64 may trigger criminal liability under CRS
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:38.580]  title 18 to include unlawful dispensing, sale, and distribution of marijuana or marijuana
[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:39.700]  concentrate.
[01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:46.420]  Which means if you're there giving away cannabis as a booth, they can arrest you for unlawful
[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:49.780]  distribution of marijuana or marijuana concentrate.
[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:54.260]  And then it continues to say the MED will continue to work with Colorado licensees to
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:59.300]  promote a strong and legitimate regulatory framework for the Colorado marijuana industry.
[01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:04.260]  MED will hold both businesses and individual marijuana licensees responsible for violations
[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:06.420]  of state statutes and regulations.
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:11.380]  Failure to abide by the statutes and regulations may result in a range of sanctions up to including
[01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:16.580]  the suspension and revocation of marijuana business or occupational licenses in addition
[01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:19.380]  to possible criminal charges and penalties.
[01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:23.700]  So what they're saying there is everybody that works in an MED regulated facility has
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:27.780]  to have an MED badge, which mine should be sitting on the table there.
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:28.660]  There it is.
[01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:29.460]  It's a little green badge.
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:30.340]  It's got your picture on it.
[01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:31.220]  It's got your name on it.
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:33.140]  And it says marijuana enforcement division.
[01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:35.140]  And then there are three different colors.
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:40.500]  There are support badges, which are usually the trimmers, the bud tenders and stuff.
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:46.340]  And then there are key badges, which are people that make decisions is basically how that
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:47.060]  goes.
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:54.420]  Managers, master growers, lead growers, those guys are your key holder badges.
[01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:56.100]  And then above that is the owner badge.
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:57.380]  And those are bright red.
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:58.820]  You only see those very rarely.
[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:03.620]  But they're saying that if you get caught doing something stupid at this event, they
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:09.060]  will revoke not only the business license, but they're going to take away the employee
[01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:11.220]  MED badge license, which is kind of sketchy too.
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:15.300]  So guys, if you're out there supporting a dispensary, you got big balls and I got a
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:16.100]  lot of respect for you.
[01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:16.660]  Be careful.
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:18.420]  Don't lose your business license.
[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:20.260]  Then the letter ends with you.
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:25.060]  If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact investigator Victor Ross, field
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:28.660]  enforcement section, Denver office at, and then they give his email address and his phone
[01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:29.300]  number.
[01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:32.020]  Thanks for your understanding, support and cooperation.
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:33.780]  And then it looks like a three-year-old signed the letter.
[01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:37.700]  So apparently they're serious about this.
[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:38.820]  They're not messing around.
[01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:42.660]  And then Hitman Glass Dougie, shout out to Dougie.
[01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:45.860]  If you don't know Dougie from Hitman Glass, say what's up to him at the Cannabis Cup.
[01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:50.260]  I might put this episode out a couple of days early, just so that you can hear this before
[01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:53.380]  the cup, you know, this is cup day here, but happy 420.
[01:59:53.380 --> 02:00:00.180]  Anyway, Dougie raises the question in Colorado here, their goal was to regulate alcohol or
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:01.780]  regulate cannabis like alcohol.
[02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:06.340]  Now, this does not seem like the fair way to do it, right?
[02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:10.660]  Because when you go to any event in Colorado, you see cores everywhere.
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:14.340]  You see Budweiser it's course everywhere because we've got a lot of cores breweries here, but
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:19.460]  you see cores, you see Bud, you see fat tire, you see so many beer ads everywhere you go
[02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:20.180]  in Colorado.
[02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:24.820]  And if you go to like the food festivals, if you go to a football game, a baseball game,
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:26.340]  there are beer ads.
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:32.180]  Now what's wrong with having cannabis people, cannabis businesses at cannabis events.
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:36.900]  If we're going to go do beer events where we serve beer everywhere, it's just unfair.
[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:38.020]  I think it's hypocritical.
[02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:39.700]  It's not what we asked for.
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:40.820]  It's not what we voted for.
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:41.700]  We need to find a way.
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:46.100]  The big flaw in all the Colorado laws, in my opinion, is that we can buy cannabis.
[02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:46.980]  We can grow cannabis.
[02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:48.180]  We can possess cannabis.
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:52.740]  We can have cannabis, but the only place you're really allowed to consume cannabis is in your
[02:00:52.740 --> 02:00:53.380]  own home.
[02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:58.740]  That's the only legal place in the privacy or another person's home or in a private place.
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:03.940]  And we've tried to have events that we've called private, but then once the cops show
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:07.540]  up, they call it public and we can't have our dab events or smoke outs there anymore.
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:11.780]  So that's the flaw in our law is having some more legal to smoke and being able to have
[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:14.900]  these booths come and bring their wares and advertise heavily.
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:16.500]  It kind of sucks that they're tracking down.
[02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:20.900]  This might be, this year could set a precedent for how the cups are going to go in the future.
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:21.940]  They may change things.
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:24.340]  I hope it goes well.
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:25.860]  Guys, if you're going to the cannabis cup, be safe.
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:28.420]  I'm going to put this episode out a couple of days early is what I feel like I need to
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:31.380]  do so that you guys can hear this, but please be safe.
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:32.580]  Please be safe at the cup.
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:35.140]  Also, if you're at the cup, find me, dude.
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:36.420]  I'm a six foot five white guy.
[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:41.700]  I've got dreadlocks to my ass region, kind of past my ass, kind of thigh region.
[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:45.140]  I'm wearing an iRegenetics t-shirt or hoodie.
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:46.900]  Most likely got a grassroots hat on.
[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:47.460]  It's crooked.
[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:49.300]  I'm easy to find it.
[02:01:49.300 --> 02:01:50.340]  I'm a smiley white guy.
[02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:52.020]  I'm goofy.
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:53.060]  Yeah.
[02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:55.380]  Anyway, find me, say what's up to me at the cannabis cup.
[02:01:56.420 --> 02:01:57.940]  Let's talk about the 420 weekend.
[02:01:57.940 --> 02:01:58.260]  Let's see.
[02:01:58.260 --> 02:01:59.140]  What am I going to do?
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:00.180]  Where can you guys find me?
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:02.660]  If you guys want to hang out and take a dab, if you want to smoke a joint with me, smoke
[02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:03.220]  a bowl with me.
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:04.660]  Let's see.
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:10.340]  Wednesday night, the 15th, I will be at Cervantes in Denver, checking out a band called Morgan
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:11.220]  Heritage.
[02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:12.980]  Definitely one of my favorite reggae bands.
[02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:16.340]  I live 125 miles from that concert.
[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:17.460]  I'm going by myself.
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:24.660]  If you want to dab me out before, hit me up, email me, Facebook me, Instagram me something.
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:31.380]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com, at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:35.620]  You can just find grow from your heart on Facebook, but seriously, I'm down to dab with
[02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:36.020]  you or something.
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:36.900]  I'll have some time to kill.
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:37.700]  I'll go up there early.
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:42.980]  If you're somewhere near Cervantes, I'm not sure which Cervantes, there are several Cervantes
[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:43.380]  venues.
[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:45.140]  I got to look at my ticket and see which one it is.
[02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:48.740]  But if you're somewhere near one of the Cervantes and want to dab me out on Wednesday, I'm all
[02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:49.220]  about that.
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:54.980]  Thursday, I'll be up in Colorado Springs seeing Hydro.
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:03:00.100]  My friend Hydro performs some pretty dope ass hip hop rap style stuff.
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:01.140]  Really positive dude.
[02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:06.020]  I'm going to go dab him out in Colorado Springs on Thursday.
[02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:10.580]  Friday, I'm packing up, taking care of the plants real good, getting them all happy,
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:12.820]  making sure everything at home is cool.
[02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:16.260]  Then Friday night, heading up to Denver for the Cannabis Cup.
[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:18.180]  Got to go get in my hotel room Friday night.
[02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:22.020]  Once again, if you're in Denver Friday night, you want to take some dabs, let me know.
[02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:24.260]  We will get down on all of that.
[02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:24.580]  You know what?
[02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:27.380]  I think this episode is going to have to come out Wednesday or something, and then we'll
[02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:29.220]  just do another episode for 420.
[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:30.020]  That's what I think we'll do.
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:32.740]  I told you Wednesday, I told you Thursday.
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:34.420]  Friday, I'm packing up, heading up to the Cup.
[02:03:34.420 --> 02:03:38.500]  Saturday, I'm getting up early and heading to the Cannabis Cup as soon as I wake up.
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:42.100]  I'm just going to take a shower, get some food, go to the Cup, and rage it up.
[02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:45.620]  Saturday night, I don't have any plans at the Cannabis Cup or after the Cup.
[02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:49.060]  So if you got something going on Saturday night, send me a message.
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:49.940]  We'll get it on.
[02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:50.820]  Sunday, same deal.
[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:54.660]  I want to get up, head to the Cannabis Cup, go have fun, go see all my friends.
[02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:55.460]  I want to shake your hand.
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:56.660]  I want to shake everybody's hand.
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:57.700]  So find me there Sunday.
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:00.100]  Monday is going to be a big day.
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:02.340]  Monday, I might get to the Cup a little bit late.
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:04.340]  I might sleep in a little bit because I've got a long night.
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:07.220]  So it'll be Cannabis Cup.
[02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:12.580]  And then at 9.45, I've got VIP tickets to see Doug Benson record a new comedy special
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:13.380]  at Comedy Works.
[02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:16.340]  So I will definitely be there a little bit early.
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:19.380]  There's usually a smokeout with Doug before or after the show.
[02:04:19.380 --> 02:04:23.300]  I can't tell you if that'll happen publicly or privately, but I will definitely get Doug
[02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:24.980]  nice and blazed for his recording.
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:30.980]  After Doug Benson, depending on how late it is and how I'm feeling, I might venture over
[02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:32.980]  to Cervantes or maybe it's Coyotes.
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:33.380]  I don't know.
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:35.540]  I'll find out for sure by the time the show comes.
[02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:40.180]  But Lee Scratch Perry with special guests will be at a club in Denver.
[02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:43.860]  And if I've got the energy, I'm going to head over to that and see what's going on and check
[02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:44.740]  out some more reggae.
[02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:46.260]  Then I'm going to drive home.
[02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:51.460]  I got to drive 125, 130-ish miles, about two hours back home, take care of the garden,
[02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:52.980]  make sure nothing went crazy.
[02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:53.940]  Hit a couple of spots.
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:55.540]  I got to check on some plants on Tuesday.
[02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:59.300]  Then Tuesday, I think I'm heading back up to Denver, have lunch with somebody.
[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:01.140]  And then I got to come back to the house.
[02:05:02.020 --> 02:05:05.220]  Then Wednesday is going to be, I got a comedy show.
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:09.220]  I'm going to go see Greg Proops at the Comedy Works in Denver.
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:14.100]  And that's going to wrap up my 420 celebration week, unless something cool is happening Thursday
[02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:14.740]  or Friday.
[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:18.020]  But we're rolling deep already, so I got to quit making plans.
[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:20.820]  We're putting a big bite in the wallet, but it's worth it, dude.
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:22.020]  It's 420 weekend.
[02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:23.460]  We're going all out.
[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:24.660]  All right.
[02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:28.740]  So if you see me at one of those places, you want to join me at one of those places, you
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:31.060]  want to hang out before or after something like that, let me know.
[02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:34.180]  Also at the Cannabis Cup, a few of my friends have booths.
[02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:36.820]  Garden of Weeden and the Smokers Club have a booth.
[02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:38.900]  My friends with Sour Seeds have a booth.
[02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:43.060]  There are a lot of my homies have booths, and I will be hanging out at those booths,
[02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:44.020]  just kicking it.
[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:47.140]  Sometimes I'll have, I may have a couple of t-shirts in my backpack.
[02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:50.180]  I don't really want to lug them around, but I may have some t-shirts with me.
[02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:51.220]  I won't have any seeds.
[02:05:51.220 --> 02:05:52.260]  I'm sold out of seeds, you guys.
[02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:52.740]  I'm sorry.
[02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:56.740]  That's a good thing for me, terrible thing for you, but nature's green remedies and all
[02:05:56.740 --> 02:05:58.420]  the locals, clean me the fuck out.
[02:05:58.420 --> 02:05:58.980]  Thank you, guys.
[02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:01.060]  But I'll be at those booths.
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.180]  I may do a little speaking.
[02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:04.820]  If somebody has some questions or something, you can ask me questions.
[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:05.540]  Don't be shy.
[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:07.940]  Like, seriously, I'm just some dude.
[02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:09.460]  Walk up, shake my hand, introduce yourself.
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:10.980]  You may make a friend for life.
[02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:12.580]  I'm kind of a shy guy myself.
[02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:16.260]  Honestly, you might not really believe that, but there's nobody here right now, so I could
[02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:17.540]  talk into a microphone.
[02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:18.660]  People freak me out, bro.
[02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:21.540]  So that's my plan for the Cannabis Cup weekend.
[02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:23.380]  What else are we going to talk about?
[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:25.700]  Let's get to this email that a friend of mine sent.
[02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.300]  FastBerry sent me an email.
[02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:29.860]  I'm looking for it.
[02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:31.140]  I've got so many emails here.
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:31.620]  Here we are.
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:34.020]  Dude, I know this is kind of late.
[02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:39.060]  You sent me this on April 5th, but I haven't recorded a show since I had CannaVenture over,
[02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:44.900]  but I know my recording schedule is hectic and getting the episodes out once a week kind
[02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:45.940]  of puts you behind on this.
[02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:48.740]  FastBerry at Gmail.com sent me this email.
[02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:50.260]  It says, Rhode Island needs some help.
[02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:52.420]  And he said, I'm at FastBerry from Instagram.
[02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:55.380]  We have a problem in Rhode Island with the caregivers program.
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:07:01.940]  If you could read this and put the word out about contacting local government for anyone
[02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:03.940]  who listens, the community would be grateful.
[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:09.940]  So if you are in Rhode Island, FastBerry needs your help.
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:13.940]  Apparently, there's some shit happening with the medical marijuana caregivers program in
[02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:16.660]  Rhode Island and we need your support.
[02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:18.020]  So here's what you got to do.
[02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:21.620]  If you're in Rhode Island, go to this email or go to this website.
[02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:23.860]  It is HTTP.
[02:07:23.860 --> 02:07:24.180]  Okay.
[02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:26.580]  Go to ripatients.org, you guys.
[02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:31.940]  ripatients.org slash index dot HTML.
[02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:36.260]  That's where most of the information is organized and accessible is what FastBerry says.
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:38.980]  Also, make sure you follow FastBerry on Instagram.
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:41.220]  Tell him that you heard about him through the show.
[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:42.500]  Give him a little bump on Instagram.
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:43.140]  Make him smile.
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:45.300]  But you got to do what you can do.
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:47.060]  So I'm going to click on the link here and see what's going on.
[02:07:47.060 --> 02:07:52.900]  If you guys are in Rhode Island, that's part of your job to go there and contact your local
[02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:58.020]  Congress people and let them know that you don't like the bullshit they're trying to do.
[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:01.780]  Bill seeks to eliminate caregivers.
[02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:07.460]  A new Senate bill would eliminate the caregiver to create for-profit entities that will grow
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:09.300]  and sell cannabis to the compassion.
[02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:10.260]  No, fuck that, dude.
[02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:10.820]  We don't need that.
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:14.820]  Guys, I'm going to contact these people and tell them that's bullshit because that's
[02:08:16.100 --> 02:08:18.020]  kind of what happened here in Colorado indirectly.
[02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:19.700]  We got rid of the caregiver model.
[02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:20.660]  We got rid of the patients.
[02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:23.860]  And now it's just commercialized cannabis and the medical patients that need quality
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:24.820]  herb are not getting it.
[02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:27.140]  And I feel that they're the ones that started this.
[02:08:27.140 --> 02:08:29.620]  So you guys in Rhode Island, don't let this shit happen, dude.
[02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:30.820]  That is stupid.
[02:08:30.820 --> 02:08:31.940]  Don't let that happen.
[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:32.820]  Oh my God.
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:34.500]  FastBerry, thanks for getting my attention on that.
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:36.180]  I'll do what I can, dude.
[02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:37.220]  So that's a call to action.
[02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:40.660]  I don't ask you guys to do a lot of shit, but get on there and help FastBerry with that.
[02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:41.940]  All right.
[02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:43.860]  What's next on the agenda here?
[02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:45.940]  We're going 20 minutes.
[02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:47.540]  You guys want to do a really short episode?
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:51.460]  Let's read like one or two news articles and then just get the shit out of here, right?
[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:54.340]  I've got some news articles.
[02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:55.940]  Here's one.
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:57.140]  You guys are going to like this one.
[02:08:57.140 --> 02:08:57.860]  I'm going to take a drink.
[02:08:57.860 --> 02:09:00.100]  I got some frosty cold root beer just staring at me.
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:07.080]  Oh, that's delicious.
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:07.580]  Yeah.
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:09.480]  All right.
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:11.960]  So this article says Colorado's record pot.
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:13.800]  No, let me read that again.
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:15.240]  That big drink made me fucking stupid.
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:18.120]  Speaking of being stupid, I'm going to rant here for a minute again.
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:22.120]  About 16 days ago, I got a major concussion.
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:24.760]  I don't think it, yeah, it was about 16 days ago.
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:25.560]  So I can't even count.
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:27.560]  I've talked about it on the show.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:30.440]  I didn't realize, but I hit my head twice.
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:31.640]  I told you guys I hit my head, right?
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:35.320]  But I hit my head, but then I fell down some stairs and at the bottom of the stairs, I hit
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:38.520]  my head again and I just found on the back of my head a few days ago, I found a nice
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:39.640]  well on the back there too.
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:43.160]  I was a lot more fucked up than I realized you guys.
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:47.000]  I recorded two podcasts with Mike and Adam that are fuzzy to me.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.920]  I don't, a lot of that stuff, that guy talking wasn't completely Rasta Jeff.
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:54.200]  That's kind of my subconscious doing its weird shit on those episodes.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.360]  The show with Ken Aventure, with Rusty and Rob, I feel like it was kind of getting my
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:02.360]  shit back together, but there are moments in that podcast where I don't know what the
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:03.720]  fuck was going on to tell you the truth.
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:05.880]  I hope you guys couldn't tell.
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:07.080]  I hope the shows have been all right.
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:09.000]  But I'm kind of feeling like I'm getting back together.
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:11.800]  My brain is kind of unscrambling itself.
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:13.560]  Sometimes I forget dumb stuff.
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:18.120]  Like when I leave my house, if I'm going to certain people's houses, I have to think about
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:20.280]  when I pull out of the driveway, which way should I go?
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:21.480]  It used to be subconscious.
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:22.840]  If you're going to this guy's house, you turn left.
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:23.880]  If you're going to his, you turn right.
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:26.200]  Now I have to kind of think about it like, where are you going, bro?
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:27.080]  Oh, you're going to his house.
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:27.640]  You should go left.
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:29.320]  But that shit's coming back.
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:30.520]  Honestly, it's all coming back.
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:32.760]  Every doctor says that it just takes time.
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:34.760]  Every doctor says that it just takes time.
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:38.920]  If you see me at the cannabis cup and you want to dab me out, please don't give me a
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:39.720]  half gram dab.
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:40.680]  Please don't fuck me up.
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:41.960]  I just need little dabs.
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:42.760]  I'm still healing.
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:44.520]  The dabs make my temperature go crazy.
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:48.040]  It makes my wound on my head throb a lot.
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:49.480]  So don't dab me out too hard.
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:50.600]  But little dabs are cool.
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:52.120]  I take little dabs all day.
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:54.760]  But yeah, I know that's fucking random, right?
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:55.320]  Here we go.
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:11:02.680]  This article says Colorado's record February pot sales yield $2.1 million for schools.
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:03.960]  That's right.
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:06.760]  Pot sales $2.1 million for schools.
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:07.880]  Isn't that great?
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:10.360]  We're selling cannabis and it's paying for school.
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:11.480]  People never thought that would happen.
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:13.240]  I'm going to read you the article.
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:15.560]  It is by Ricardo Baca from The Cannabis.
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:21.080]  And it says Colorado sold a record amount of recreational marijuana in February 2015.
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:27.320]  According to new data released by the state on Friday, around $39.2 million of recreational
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:29.960]  cannabis was sold in state shops in February.
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:34.680]  According to calculations based on data provided by the Colorado Department of Revenue, the
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:40.520]  previous monthly record for recreational sales was January 2015, $36.4 million.
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:44.520]  Much of that growth comes excuse me, I'm burping from the root beer.
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:45.560]  Here we go.
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:46.280]  I'm back on track.
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:51.480]  Much of that growth comes from additional shops opening up and still new recreational
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:56.040]  cities, including Aurora, Colorado's third most populous city that only started selling
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:57.720]  a retail pot last October.
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:03.640]  Say we just opened the ninth store in Aurora said Meg Collins, vice president of the business
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:08.040]  development for good chemistry, which operates a shop in central Denver and its brand new
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:09.480]  flagship store in Aurora.
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:13.960]  In addition to being part owners of Denver shop, wellspring, wow, these guys are rolling.
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:18.200]  The activity in Aurora has helped boost those sales and tax numbers.
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:22.280]  And people are also getting more comfortable with purchasing legally, knowing that it's
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:24.360]  available and becoming a bit more mainstream.
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:25.960]  And that's helping sales too.
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:30.200]  Which guys people were afraid to go into the stores and buy recreational cannabis.
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:34.920]  For some reason, people were afraid of medical cannabis for a long time, but it seems like
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:37.960]  people are kind of getting excited about it.
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:41.880]  Now there was one group of people that was dispenser that were dispensary connoisseurs.
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:45.400]  They knew everything about the dispensary and some people just seem kind of anxious
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:46.040]  to get in there.
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:52.040]  So the article goes on to say, and anything that helps legal sales helps erode the black
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:52.520]  market.
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:58.360]  Colorado's total medical marijuana sales in February, 2015, added up to about $29.3
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:02.200]  million up more than $1 million from the previous month.
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:06.520]  The record for medical marijuana sales in Colorado's recreational era, which started
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:14.440]  January 1st, 2014 came in February of 2014 when $36 million in medical pot was sold.
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.880]  Another important indicator in Colorado's complex pot sales, a complete pot.
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:21.320]  Fuck, that's a lot of words.
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:27.160]  Another important indicator in Colorado's complex pot taxes is the almost as the amount
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:28.840]  dedicated for public schools.
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:33.480]  And that monthly total was more than $2 million for the second consecutive month in February.
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:39.160]  In January, the excise tax on wholesale marijuana transfers raised more than $2.3 million for
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:39.560]  schools.
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:42.040]  And in February, it totaled $2.1 million.
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:47.960]  The monthly excise taxes earmarked for school construction capital never topped $2 million
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:52.520]  in 2014, the first year of recreational pot sales in Colorado.
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:14:02.280]  In 2014, Colorado sold nearly $700 million a pot, $385.9 million for medical marijuana,
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:06.920]  and $313.2 million for recreational cannabis.
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:11.720]  Projections based on the first two months of 2015's recreational and medical numbers
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:17.640]  suggest that Colorado will sell more marijuana and collect more in pot-related taxes in 2015
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:20.200]  than it did in 2014.
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:22.120]  I can support that.
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:27.320]  I'm the grower at the spot now, and we're still working on the grows and getting everything
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:27.800]  in place.
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:32.120]  But I'm there often in meetings and talking about where to put this and how to do that
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:34.360]  and where we're going to do everything and who's going to do what.
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:40.280]  But when I'm there, I see the sales happening and they are getting busier than ever, busier
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:40.920]  than ever.
[02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:46.600]  And I also hang out with my good friends at Green and Healthy Wellness, and I see those
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:49.160]  guys getting busier than ever.
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:53.240]  So more and more people are buying cannabis and there are more shops popping up.
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:59.720]  And with more shops popping up around us and the spot staying as busy as it is, that tells
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:03.640]  me that all those other shops have to be selling stuff too because people go check out new
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:04.600]  places.
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:07.800]  And I feel like a lot of the people that come from out of state, they know they can only
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:09.240]  buy seven grams at one shop.
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:12.120]  So they probably go visit several shops.
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:14.600]  And in my area, there are a lot of them.
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:17.560]  I have lost count how many are out in Pueblo West right now.
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:19.400]  So the shops are getting busy.
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:20.280]  They're staying busy.
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:21.320]  It's only going to get busier.
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:23.240]  We're only going to bring in more money for the schools.
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:26.280]  They have actually fixed a bunch of potholes in my neighborhood.
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:29.560]  And I don't know if that was related to any cannabis money or not, but man, it was about
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:30.600]  time they fix that shit.
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:31.720]  All right.
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:33.880]  What else do I got for you in the news world?
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:36.520]  Read a couple more articles and then we're going to get out of here.
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:38.680]  This is a kind of a great article.
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:40.200]  I thought this guy was a freaking genius.
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:41.560]  This one's from the Cannabis also.
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:46.280]  It says city council candidate who owns a pot shop is campaigning via pizza box.
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:49.000]  The article is by John Murray of the Denver Post.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.960]  And it says, don't accuse Denver city council at large candidate.
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:53.960]  Cave in.
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:55.560]  I got to say his name, right?
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:56.760]  Calit Bari.
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:58.280]  Calit Bari.
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:15:59.160]  Calit Bari.
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:15:59.960]  Yeah, I got that right.
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:01.400]  I was getting lost in the crowd.
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:05.560]  If there's one thing he knows how to do, it's stand out this time on a pizza box.
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:09.640]  Calit Bari has been harnessing the natural delivery system of one of several businesses
[02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:12.440]  he co-owns sexy pizza pizza.
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:13.400]  Why can't I see pizza?
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:13.960]  I love pizza.
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:18.440]  It was hard to say sexy pizza, which is three locations in central Denver neighborhoods
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:22.120]  by affixing campaign flyers to pizza boxes before they're sent out to customers.
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:27.480]  Calit Bari says he printed 5,000 campaign flyers for the boxes enough to last about
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:29.240]  two weeks at the pizza shops.
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:32.200]  The pizza, the piece pictures Calit Bari under the words.
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:33.640]  I'm a real person.
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:37.880]  He's running against four others for two at large seats in the May 5th election
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:41.720]  incumbent Debbie Ortega and Robin Kniech are fellow challengers.
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.680]  Joe Sylvia and Jeffrey Washington.
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:45.720]  Oh, and fellow challenger.
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:49.080]  Sorry, I read that word wrong and fellow challengers, Joe Silva and Jeffrey Washington.
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:53.000]  So far, Calit Bari, excuse me, I got to take a drink.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.120]  My throat's all clogged up.
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:55.240]  Let's go for some water this time.
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:56.520]  I think that root beer is what clogged me.
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:16:59.000]  All right, that's better.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.560]  So far, Calit Bari, who also co-owns Denver Relief, the city's oldest marijuana dispensary
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:07.080]  has raised some eyebrows among fellow candidates by missing candidate forums,
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:12.040]  though he says he had conflicts and plans to begin participating in some upcoming events.
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:15.640]  His pizza box flyers are unorthodox campaigning, where it gets a little
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:20.040]  squishy is that under Denver election code, Calit Bari must report sexy pizzas,
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:26.040]  seating of the cardboard real estate and arguably the delivery service as an in kind contribution.
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:30.600]  He says he plans to do so, but it's unclear what that's worth.
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:35.320]  Denver leads it up, leaves it up to candidates to assign a fair market value that's reasonable.
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:39.960]  Calit Bari says he's mulling that over and will probably rate the value at a penny or two per
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:44.040]  flyer or 50 to a hundred dollars total on his next campaign finance report.
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:51.800]  He says that's reasonable because he's used sexy pizzas boxes to promote his other businesses,
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:57.160]  including Denver Relief and sex bot comedy shows, as well as partners events at no charge.
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:01.000]  He pointed out that his campaign volunteers, not sexy pizzas employees,
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.800]  are attaching the flyers to the boxes in advance.
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:07.800]  So technically he's not really using the pizza shop employees. He's using his own guys.
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:11.160]  So he's not using the pizza shop as like slave labor.
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:16.040]  Yeah, that's political crap you have to worry about.
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:20.520]  So perhaps it was inevitable that Calit Bari would attempt such synergy
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:22.520]  and his run for Denver city council.
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:26.840]  This is after all the same guy who tried to make a point and mock governor John Hickenlooper,
[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:31.400]  a former beer brewer who opposed pot legalization by following him around in a chicken suit.
[02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:34.120]  And there's a picture of the student, a chicken suit smoking a spliff on a couch.
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:35.240]  It's pretty funny.
[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:39.080]  Then it says, but his mailers, his mailers strike a more serious tone,
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:43.960]  highlighting Calit Bari's business experiences and entrepreneur who started or helped start
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:46.280]  several local businesses and making the claim.
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:50.280]  I have more business experience than all current city council members combined.
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:53.800]  He's careful to mention his ownership of the marijuana shop in passing
[02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:57.880]  below his support for LGBT and transgender gender,
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:02.280]  transgendered rights and his position as an opponent of greedy developers.
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:06.440]  He's drawn more serious fundraising support lately out,
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:09.880]  out raising the other four candidates in March by collecting $22,383.
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:15.000]  Though he still trails the incumbents overall totals significantly.
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:19.640]  That this article is written weird right here.
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:24.680]  It hard to say it is hard to say if he's rounding up enough support to threaten Ortega or niche
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:27.480]  on May 5th, but Calit Bari always exudes confidence.
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:31.960]  He noted that the pizza box flyers amount to a fraction of his efforts.
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:35.320]  We're going to end up doing right around 70,000 mailers.
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:39.880]  He said, they're going to go to various demographics and we're making a couple thousand phone calls.
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:43.960]  The social media is really what I'm getting a kick out of right now.
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:47.240]  So this article was first published on the Denver post.com.
[02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:52.120]  I think it's great that this guy who is part owner of a dispensary owns a pizza joint and
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:55.720]  is running for office in Denver is attaching his flyers to pizza boxes.
[02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:57.080]  You're hitting your target audience.
[02:19:58.440 --> 02:19:59.080]  That's perfect.
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:01.880]  I'm sorry about the throat clearing in the funky voice here.
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:06.440]  If you guys want to come talk on the podcast to be across the table from me so that I don't
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:09.640]  have to talk to the wall, you won't have to hear me clear my throat so much.
[02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:10.920]  I'd love you on the show.
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:12.200]  Tell me what you want to talk about.
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:13.240]  We'll bring you on.
[02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:16.360]  You don't have to be some elitist or anybody too crazy to get on this show.
[02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:17.720]  Just got to be cool.
[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:20.280]  As long as you're not crazy, we'll bring you on.
[02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:20.600]  All right.
[02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:21.880]  I want to read one more article.
[02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:23.160]  How long have we been recording?
[02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:25.000]  Come here, GarageBand.
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:25.880]  Show me, show me.
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:26.680]  32 minutes.
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:29.800]  If this article is short, we'll do it.
[02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:31.240]  If it's too long, we're going to skip it.
[02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:32.440]  Oh, that's long.
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:33.800]  I don't think we're going to do this article.
[02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:35.400]  No, it's too long.
[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:36.120]  We'll just skip it.
[02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:39.160]  We'll talk about this one on the next episode.
[02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:39.400]  Yeah.
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:41.320]  So the next episode, we're going to do an article.
[02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:45.800]  We'll read an article about a special report, edible safety still a concern for Colorado.
[02:20:45.800 --> 02:20:46.440]  We'll read that.
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:50.440]  The next episode will probably actually come out on 420.
[02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:53.880]  It's not going to be a really long episode either.
[02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:57.080]  But the one after that will be my Cannabis Cup review episode.
[02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:01.640]  The episode after that, we are going to talk about planning your gardens,
[02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:06.440]  getting the schedule for your garden figured out so that you could be as productive as you can be,
[02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:09.560]  so that you're not behind, so that you're not ahead, so that you're not missing clones when
[02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:10.040]  you need them.
[02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:15.560]  I plan to get Jesse over to do more outdoor stuff.
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:17.080]  Jesse is a busy man lately.
[02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:18.600]  He's doing his own outdoor stuff.
[02:21:18.600 --> 02:21:20.200]  So we got to bear with him.
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:23.080]  We'll get Mike over to talk about some politics pretty soon.
[02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:24.760]  I've got a couple of more guests in mind.
[02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:27.800]  The Cannabis Cup is coming, so you never know what could happen at the Cup.
[02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:29.560]  We may talk to some people while we're there.
[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:31.080]  Let's see.
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:33.640]  What else do I need to talk about in this meeting or in this episode?
[02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:35.400]  I just saw the word meeting on my notepaper.
[02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:36.360]  So we'll talk about that.
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:40.120]  There's a growers meeting, April 26th at Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:44.600]  If you were in Pueblo, Colorado or the surrounding area, it would be worth your time to come hang out
[02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:49.640]  with us at Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies at 618 East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:52.760]  My friend Jesse has some things he wants to talk about.
[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:58.680]  If he doesn't do his whole time, if he doesn't take the whole time, I plan to talk about some
[02:21:58.680 --> 02:21:59.000]  stuff.
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:03.480]  I'll probably repeat a little bit of the garden planning stuff that I plan on doing for the
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:04.360]  podcast episode.
[02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:07.000]  I'm writing it out for the class and the episode is one thing.
[02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:09.000]  I want to get that info out there.
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:10.600]  Let's see.
[02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:11.560]  What else should we talk about?
[02:22:11.560 --> 02:22:15.000]  Let's close up the show and I will see you guys in a few days.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:18.040]  Like I said, guys, if you see me at any of these events coming up over the next week,
[02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:19.480]  I'm a tall white guy.
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:20.360]  I got dreadlocks.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.760]  Probably there's going to be a lot of those there.
[02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:26.440]  I'm not the guy with dreadlocks in my beard.
[02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:27.880]  I do not have dreads in my beard.
[02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:28.680]  That's another guy.
[02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:29.400]  He's cool too.
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:30.120]  High five him.
[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:33.400]  If you want to come up and meet me, introduce yourself.
[02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:34.600]  I'm not shy.
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:35.320]  I'm not afraid of you.
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:36.280]  I'd love to be your friend.
[02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:37.080]  So come say what's up.
[02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:39.240]  I am kind of shy, but I'm not shy to meet you.
[02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:40.600]  I'm not shy to say hi to you.
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:41.240]  Come be my friend.
[02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:42.280]  Say what's up to me.
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:43.320]  I'm going to quit rambling.
[02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:45.160]  I'm going to wrap up the show here.
[02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:46.440]  What else do we want to say?
[02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:47.560]  I guess that's it.
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:49.960]  Don't forget to check out my sponsors, the Rocky Mountain Worm Company and
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:51.320]  Hygro and our growing supplies.

[02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:40.040]  appreciate it.
[02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:41.560]  I could use a couple more microphones.
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:42.920]  I could use another pair of headphones.
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:45.160]  Stuff like that always adds up.

[02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:52.840]  I've been posting a lot of great pictures.
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:55.080]  I just hit 14,000 followers.
[02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:56.680]  You'll love the cannabis photography.
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:23:59.640]  I hope to meet you at the Cannabis Cup, you guys.
[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:01.000]  I'm going to wrap up the show.
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:04.120]  I'm going to try to put out another episode on Monday also, but I can't promise anything.
[02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:05.160]  It's going to be a hectic week.
[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:08.360]  We'll get back to our schedule pretty soon here, no matter what happens.
[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:10.360]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:11.960]  Big, huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:12.760]  Thanks again for listening.
[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:15.960]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:05.220]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:08.980]  It's time for episode number 65 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:12.100]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:16.820]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:20.740]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or someone who's just curious about the current state of
[02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:23.860]  cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:24.900]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:25.860]  Thanks again for joining me.
[02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:29.700]  As always, I want to send a big thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting me use
[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:30.820]  their music on the show.
[02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:34.340]  Huge thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:25:34.340 --> 02:25:36.340]  I'm going to do a solo episode for you guys.
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:38.260]  This episode will come out on 420.
[02:25:39.220 --> 02:25:40.820]  Before I get too far, I want to read the ads.
[02:25:41.380 --> 02:25:44.180]  This podcast is brought to you by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:47.460]  Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations to serve Colorado.

[02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:15.700]  Also, the organic portions of this episode are sponsored by my friends at the Rocky Mountain
[02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:16.580]  Worm Company.

[02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:37.540]  use through www.RockyMountainWormCompany.com.
[02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:38.580]  Check them out today.

[02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:45.380]  Make sure you let them know you heard about them through the podcast.
[02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:48.580]  And if you're lucky, maybe they'll give you a small tour of the worm farm.
[02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:49.700]  It's pretty neat if you're interested.
[02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:50.260]  Check that out.
[02:26:51.380 --> 02:26:54.340]  Big love and lots of respect to everybody that helps the show.
[02:26:54.340 --> 02:26:56.740]  Also, big shout out to NaturesGreenRemedies.com.

[02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:01.300]  I'll get you all the information.
[02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:03.060]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:27:04.340 --> 02:27:07.940]  So I got a really cool email or a Facebook message from somebody the other day.
[02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:08.820]  Let's start with that.
[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:10.180]  Where's that message?
[02:27:10.180 --> 02:27:10.900]  Here it is.
[02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:11.700]  I want to read this one.
[02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:14.900]  I'm not going to say your name on the show because you didn't say if you wanted me to
[02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:15.300]  or not.
[02:27:15.940 --> 02:27:18.100]  You sent me a personal message and I'm going to read it out loud.
[02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:20.980]  It says, Rasta Jeff, big fan of the podcast.
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:25.380]  I recently finished binge listening to the whole bat catalog and enjoyed every episode.
[02:27:25.380 --> 02:27:26.420]  I'm somewhat disappointed.
[02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:29.940]  I now have to go days between episodes, but I'm sure I'll cope.
[02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:32.900]  I've learned a lot from the grow lessons with you, Jesse and Spence.
[02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:36.900]  It's nice to have a lighthouse in the sea of bullshit that is the internet forums.
[02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:40.980]  So I'm glad you pointed that out because that's part of what inspired me to want to do.
[02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:44.660]  I wanted to write a book originally, but I'm too scatterbrained to write a damn book.
[02:27:44.660 --> 02:27:49.780]  So we did a podcast and part of my goal was to dispel a bunch of the bullshit that we
[02:27:49.780 --> 02:27:51.540]  see on the internet and in the forums.
[02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:54.260]  So I'm glad you realize that that's what we're out and trying to do.
[02:27:54.260 --> 02:27:55.780]  I'm glad you appreciate it.
[02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:59.540]  So then he goes on to say, I was halfway through vegging a half dozen plants in bubble
[02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:02.260]  buckets when I started listening to the GFYH.
[02:28:02.260 --> 02:28:05.940]  Needless to say, I have seen the light and I'm gearing up to switch to soil for the next
[02:28:05.940 --> 02:28:06.420]  run.
[02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:09.700]  And I have planned with hopes of soon becoming fully organic.
[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:12.660]  Dude, don't worry about jumping in fully organic.
[02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:15.940]  Just do what you can to get rid of those buckets and start learning how to work soil.
[02:28:16.820 --> 02:28:20.100]  Read a few books, read the TLO book like Sean and I were talking about.
[02:28:20.100 --> 02:28:21.380]  That'll definitely get you started.
[02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:22.580]  Read teaming with microbes.
[02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:23.700]  That'll get you a good start.
[02:28:24.660 --> 02:28:27.860]  Don't go too, don't try to be too hardcore about going fully organic right away.
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:29.860]  Learn how to grow and adjust solely.
[02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:32.420]  And we just want you to get there when you're ready.
[02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:36.420]  Then he goes on to say, I would like to gain some more insight and perspective from you
[02:28:36.420 --> 02:28:37.540]  on indoor soil setups.
[02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:39.540]  You've mentioned you hand water plants most of the time.
[02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:43.780]  Does this consist of literally pouring the water to each plant or some other system I
[02:28:43.780 --> 02:28:44.740]  am misunderstanding?
[02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:47.300]  And then he goes on and says, thank you for your time and effort.
[02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:51.380]  Looking forward to getting my hands on some iRi genetics as soon as they hit NGR.
[02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:54.100]  Let me go with that first paragraph there.
[02:28:54.660 --> 02:28:55.620]  Hand watering.
[02:28:55.620 --> 02:28:56.740]  Yes, I mix my...
[02:28:58.500 --> 02:29:00.900]  My personal caregiver grows, our soil grows.
[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:04.180]  So I will mix my nutrients into a large container.
[02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:07.140]  Honestly, my big batches are mixed up in a Rubbermaid trash can.
[02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:07.940]  That's how much I mix.
[02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:10.180]  And I've got a mark where it's 25 gallons.
[02:29:10.180 --> 02:29:11.860]  I mix up a 25 gallon batch.
[02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:13.540]  I'll adjust the pH.
[02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:15.780]  If I'm using organics, you can't fuck with the pH too much.
[02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:16.980]  You have to accept what it is.
[02:29:17.780 --> 02:29:20.500]  If you're using synthetic nutrients, go ahead and fix your pH.
[02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:26.180]  I use a one gallon pitcher, just like you'd get at Target or wherever else you're shopping.
[02:29:26.180 --> 02:29:26.820]  I like Target.
[02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:30.660]  Just stick the pitcher right in there and pour it right into the plant.
[02:29:30.660 --> 02:29:34.340]  That way I have a good gauge of how much I'm putting into each plant.
[02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:36.740]  I can say this plant prefers a half a gallon.
[02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:38.580]  This plant prefers a whole gallon.
[02:29:38.580 --> 02:29:39.620]  You can kind of measure that way.
[02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:43.140]  So yeah, I'm actually hand watering just by using a pitcher and dumping it into the plant.
[02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:46.180]  I run seven gallon pots are my favorites to use.
[02:29:46.820 --> 02:29:49.220]  And each seven gallon pot takes a gallon of water.
[02:29:49.220 --> 02:29:52.100]  It's a perfect mathematical equation to know how many gallons you need.
[02:29:52.660 --> 02:29:52.980]  I don't know.
[02:29:52.980 --> 02:29:53.940]  It's easy for me.
[02:29:53.940 --> 02:29:55.860]  So never a stupid question.
[02:29:55.860 --> 02:29:56.740]  That was a great question.
[02:29:56.740 --> 02:29:58.020]  I'm glad you asked.
[02:29:58.020 --> 02:29:59.780]  Also, dude, thanks for the huge compliments.
[02:29:59.780 --> 02:30:00.340]  You know who you are.
[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:01.300]  I'm not going to say your name.
[02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:03.540]  Thanks for listening to every episode.
[02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:04.580]  That's kind of cool.
[02:30:04.580 --> 02:30:07.860]  I'm trying to prevent the, what's it called?
[02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:12.020]  The withdrawals by doing episodes more often, but I don't want to burn you out.
[02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:16.260]  I save material so that I have something worth of shit so that I don't just show up and give
[02:30:16.260 --> 02:30:17.460]  you a crappy show.
[02:30:17.460 --> 02:30:20.500]  But if I've got two shows worth of material in a week, I definitely kick them out for
[02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:20.660]  you.
[02:30:20.660 --> 02:30:21.460]  So thanks for listening to do.
[02:30:21.460 --> 02:30:22.500]  Thanks for the message.
[02:30:22.500 --> 02:30:25.700]  If you guys want to send me a message on Facebook, I would definitely appreciate it.
[02:30:25.700 --> 02:30:27.060]  Read it out loud for you.
[02:30:27.940 --> 02:30:30.180]  I want to talk a little bit about what I did this week.
[02:30:30.900 --> 02:30:31.460]  Last night.
[02:30:31.460 --> 02:30:35.140]  Well, actually I'm recording at one in the morning on the what's the date right now?
[02:30:35.140 --> 02:30:36.020]  It's the 17th.
[02:30:36.020 --> 02:30:37.060]  So it was the 16th.
[02:30:37.060 --> 02:30:38.340]  It's the night of the 16th.
[02:30:38.340 --> 02:30:39.700]  It's turning into the 17th.
[02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:43.380]  So the night before last, I guess we'll talk about that.
[02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:47.620]  I got the honor to go see one of my favorite reggae bands in the whole world.
[02:30:47.620 --> 02:30:52.260]  I got to go see Morgan Heritage at Cervantes other side in Denver, Colorado.
[02:30:52.900 --> 02:30:55.220]  I drove the two hour drive by myself.
[02:30:55.220 --> 02:30:58.340]  A lot of people are like, dude, you drive up there by yourself and not a big deal.
[02:30:58.340 --> 02:31:02.420]  I listened to a podcast, take a couple dabs before I leave and it's a great trip.
[02:31:03.220 --> 02:31:06.340]  And then when you get there, you get to a reggae show and I'm a white guy with dreadlocks
[02:31:06.340 --> 02:31:06.900]  to my butt.
[02:31:06.900 --> 02:31:08.660]  And a lot of the reggae scene knows me.
[02:31:08.660 --> 02:31:11.940]  I was there for 10 minutes by myself before I made friends and bumped into people that
[02:31:11.940 --> 02:31:12.500]  I already knew.
[02:31:12.980 --> 02:31:14.820]  I was not even going by myself really.
[02:31:15.380 --> 02:31:16.580]  So Morgan Heritage came out.
[02:31:17.620 --> 02:31:19.140]  That band tore it up.
[02:31:19.140 --> 02:31:21.220]  Morgan Heritage is on fire right now.
[02:31:21.220 --> 02:31:25.620]  If you're into reggae, if you like good harmonies, if you want to see a killer live reggae show,
[02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:29.780]  I fully recommend you go check out Morgan Heritage while they're on tour.
[02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:31.220]  Their set list right now is great.
[02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:32.820]  It's a great mix from all their albums.
[02:31:32.820 --> 02:31:38.020]  They did pretty much if I made a Morgan Heritage playlist, they would have played it last night.
[02:31:38.020 --> 02:31:38.740]  It was perfect.
[02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:42.900]  So a big shout out to Morgan Heritage, big shout out to Cervantes other side.
[02:31:42.900 --> 02:31:45.060]  Also a big shout out to Carlos and his crew.
[02:31:45.060 --> 02:31:46.020]  It was good hanging out with you guys.
[02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:47.140]  Made me feel like I was at home.
[02:31:48.180 --> 02:31:50.660]  So here's where my night got really interesting.
[02:31:50.660 --> 02:31:57.460]  I walked out of, excuse me, I walked out of the venue from seeing the concert and the
[02:31:57.460 --> 02:32:00.900]  band was kind of gathering up by their tour bus across the street and I couldn't see them
[02:32:00.900 --> 02:32:02.580]  because the tour bus is long and they're on the other side.
[02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:08.260]  So I walked to the corner where I could just casually lean against a parking meter and
[02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:12.020]  stare into the Denver skyline and kind of see the band hanging out by their tour bus
[02:32:12.020 --> 02:32:13.140]  doing their thing.
[02:32:13.140 --> 02:32:15.940]  I didn't want to bug them, but I kind of just wanted to observe and it was a nice night.
[02:32:15.940 --> 02:32:19.140]  It was cold, but it was nice after being in the concert, it was nice to get some fresh
[02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:19.860]  air.
[02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:24.740]  So I'm standing on the corner and the light turns red and a car stops in front of me.
[02:32:24.740 --> 02:32:30.020]  A car stops in the far lane and then a car stops behind that car and rolls down the window
[02:32:30.820 --> 02:32:34.420]  and the guy in the driver's seat yells, hey, fuck you dreadlocks.
[02:32:35.300 --> 02:32:40.660]  And I'm just standing on the corner in downtown Denver by myself at five points, like two
[02:32:40.660 --> 02:32:41.220]  in the morning.
[02:32:42.100 --> 02:32:45.940]  And I think to myself, this is about to get sketchy as fuck.
[02:32:46.820 --> 02:32:49.780]  So I reached into my pockets to see what I've got.
[02:32:49.780 --> 02:32:53.060]  I've got a little bit of weed, I've got a little bit of dabs in my pocket.
[02:32:53.060 --> 02:32:54.580]  I got my cell phone, I got my keys.
[02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:56.820]  I don't really have anything that's going to help me out in this position.
[02:32:57.780 --> 02:33:00.020]  I had money in my pocket and I had my weed.
[02:33:00.020 --> 02:33:02.500]  Pretty much all they were going to do is kick my ass and take my weed and money is what
[02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:03.620]  I was assuming.
[02:33:03.620 --> 02:33:04.740]  So I tried to ignore them.
[02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:06.900]  I don't know why I thought being an ostrich would help.
[02:33:06.900 --> 02:33:08.340]  Just ignore them and they'll go away, right?
[02:33:08.980 --> 02:33:13.380]  But the dude rolled down his window a little further and he yelled another derogatory term
[02:33:13.380 --> 02:33:14.500]  about white guys with dreadlocks.
[02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:15.460]  I can't remember exactly.
[02:33:15.460 --> 02:33:17.860]  It didn't, that wasn't what I was worried about.
[02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:20.740]  But I could look into the car and see that it was full.
[02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:24.500]  There were at least four, five, maybe six people in that car and they were talking mad
[02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:24.980]  shit to me.
[02:33:25.700 --> 02:33:29.700]  So the dude said, fuck you Rasta, hardly Selassie is what he said to me.
[02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:32.260]  And that was when I was like, this guy knows what I'm about.
[02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:36.900]  He knows I'm a Rasta man and he's got hatred specifically for Rastafarians, especially
[02:33:36.900 --> 02:33:37.940]  white Rastas.
[02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:38.900]  And that's what I am.
[02:33:38.900 --> 02:33:40.340]  And I'm all by myself.
[02:33:40.340 --> 02:33:44.500]  So I looked down the block to the right and the concert venue was a good half a block
[02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:45.060]  away.
[02:33:45.060 --> 02:33:47.700]  I looked down to the left and there's nothing but fucking darkness.
[02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:50.340]  And I look forward and there's a coffee shop that's closed to shit.
[02:33:51.140 --> 02:33:53.300]  It's me and this car load of people.
[02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:57.860]  And they pulled up to the curb and rolled down their window.
[02:33:57.860 --> 02:34:02.020]  And it was fucking Chris Kossas from the Source Genetics dude, just picking on me.
[02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:04.900]  God, I was like, not sure if I was about to fight six people.
[02:34:04.900 --> 02:34:07.780]  I'm not sure if I was about to run down an alley and get chased.
[02:34:07.780 --> 02:34:08.820]  I don't know what I was doing.
[02:34:08.820 --> 02:34:12.660]  Turns out it's some of my damn friends that just flew in from California and we're looking
[02:34:12.660 --> 02:34:13.700]  for a spot to hang out.
[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:16.260]  Oh, nerve wracking dude.
[02:34:16.260 --> 02:34:17.780]  I was shitting my pants.
[02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:20.260]  So I run up to the car, he didn't give him a hug.
[02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:21.540]  And I was like, dude, you have no idea.
[02:34:21.540 --> 02:34:23.300]  And he's like, no, I could tell by the look on your face.
[02:34:23.300 --> 02:34:26.420]  And the guy riding passenger seat was like, why are you picking on this man?
[02:34:26.420 --> 02:34:27.220]  It was really funny.
[02:34:27.220 --> 02:34:29.700]  He had the passenger had no idea who I was.
[02:34:29.700 --> 02:34:34.500]  So Chris is like, dude, we're going to a speakeasy that happens to be just several
[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:35.700]  feet to the left of you.
[02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:39.220]  Walk up the street, we'll park and we'll meet up.
[02:34:39.220 --> 02:34:42.900]  So they find a parking spot and they get out of the car and they all give me hugs.
[02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:46.180]  It was a chick whose name I can never remember.
[02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:47.380]  I think her name is Daniela.
[02:34:47.380 --> 02:34:48.900]  Maybe, maybe, possibly.
[02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:50.740]  I'm sorry I forgot your name again, sweetie.
[02:34:50.740 --> 02:34:55.220]  Chris Kossas, Jibbs, a dude named Mike, and another dude whose name I forgot.
[02:34:56.020 --> 02:34:57.220]  I might've been high as shit.
[02:34:57.220 --> 02:34:58.020]  Sorry.
[02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:02.340]  But so we walked down the street and I can't disclose the location of this place, but we
[02:35:02.340 --> 02:35:06.580]  walked down the street half a block and there was a brown door that just looked like a normal
[02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:06.820]  door.
[02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:12.100]  There was no, there was not an identifying marker on the building, on the door, on anything.
[02:35:13.140 --> 02:35:14.500]  One of my friends knocks on the door.
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:22.020]  A man opens some blinds and sees us, opens the door, lets us into a small waiting area.
[02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:22.820]  I didn't say anything.
[02:35:22.820 --> 02:35:24.420]  So I didn't, I wasn't quite sure what was going on.
[02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:25.940]  I was just a new guy that just tagged along.
[02:35:25.940 --> 02:35:26.580]  They invited me.
[02:35:28.980 --> 02:35:32.180]  Dude hands the guy at the door 50 bucks.
[02:35:32.180 --> 02:35:34.820]  The guy shakes his hand and says all of them.
[02:35:34.820 --> 02:35:39.220]  And so another guy comes and leads us to a little further down the way and gives us a
[02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:43.220]  little seating area and we all sit down and I'm not sure what's going on really.
[02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:47.140]  I was told that we're going to this little speakeasy, but it was two in the morning and
[02:35:47.140 --> 02:35:51.380]  they were serving drinks in this joint and we sat down and I rolled, I had some flowers
[02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:52.980]  on me from the concert that I had just been to.
[02:35:52.980 --> 02:35:54.900]  I rolled a nice size joint.
[02:35:54.900 --> 02:35:59.220]  Kostas rolled a nice size joint and my buddy jibs started taking dabs of solventless like
[02:35:59.220 --> 02:36:00.260]  it was nothing.
[02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:01.620]  My buddy Mike was to the right of me.
[02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:02.740]  He started taking dabs.
[02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:04.660]  Dabs start going around.
[02:36:04.660 --> 02:36:06.740]  The joints are going around and nobody seemed to care.
[02:36:06.740 --> 02:36:08.100]  We were the only ones puffing in there.
[02:36:08.740 --> 02:36:12.660]  Kostas pointed out that that may have been a gay bar.
[02:36:12.660 --> 02:36:14.020]  I'm not quite sure.
[02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:16.900]  I'm sure that there were some gay folk in there.
[02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:21.860]  I'm not sure what qualifies it as a gay bar, but it had definitely a different vibe, but
[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:22.180]  you know what?
[02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:23.060]  I had a shit ton of fun.
[02:36:23.060 --> 02:36:24.180]  There was a pool table in there.
[02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:26.340]  I don't shoot pool, but people were shooting pool, having fun.
[02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:27.540]  They were serving drinks.
[02:36:27.540 --> 02:36:29.620]  I stayed there until 4 20 in the morning.
[02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:31.380]  It was a great time.
[02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:35.700]  I never would have discovered that if Kostas didn't scare the shit out of me.
[02:36:35.700 --> 02:36:37.540]  Chris, if you're listening to this, bro, thank you.
[02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:38.340]  I appreciate it.
[02:36:38.340 --> 02:36:39.860]  But dude, come on.
[02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:43.300]  I thought I was going to have to fight six people that night after a reggae show.
[02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:46.100]  I just had like the best reggae cleansing.
[02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:48.980]  I was feeling so good after that show and then I thought I was going to have to fight,
[02:36:48.980 --> 02:36:49.140]  man.
[02:36:49.140 --> 02:36:50.260]  My vibe totally changed.
[02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:52.260]  Don't do that to your friends, bro.
[02:36:52.260 --> 02:36:53.300]  Actually, Chris, don't ever change.
[02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:54.180]  Do that shit to your friends.
[02:36:54.180 --> 02:36:55.380]  I fucking love you for it.
[02:36:56.100 --> 02:36:56.900]  Shout out to Kostas.
[02:36:56.900 --> 02:36:57.540]  Shout out to Jib.
[02:36:57.540 --> 02:36:58.820]  Shout out to the whole crew in that car.
[02:36:58.820 --> 02:37:00.020]  Shout out to the speakeasy.
[02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:05.140]  I didn't cost me a dollar to hang out and get lit in there.
[02:37:05.140 --> 02:37:06.180]  They were super kind.
[02:37:06.180 --> 02:37:07.620]  Everybody was cool to us in there.
[02:37:07.620 --> 02:37:09.380]  I really appreciated that place.
[02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:12.020]  I will be back when I'm in the area for sure.
[02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:15.940]  Uh, so what else do we want to talk about?
[02:37:15.940 --> 02:37:18.580]  So tonight, so I came home from the speakeasy.
[02:37:18.580 --> 02:37:19.140]  I drove home.
[02:37:19.140 --> 02:37:20.260]  It was starting to snow.
[02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:22.100]  It's fucking April in Colorado.
[02:37:22.100 --> 02:37:23.940]  Snowing, snowing, dude, what the hell?
[02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:25.380]  Uh, it was windy.
[02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:26.900]  It was pushing my car sideways down.
[02:37:26.900 --> 02:37:27.620]  I 25.
[02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:28.420]  It was ridiculous.
[02:37:28.420 --> 02:37:33.940]  So I got home about six in the morning, a little after six, took a few dabs, uh, slept,
[02:37:33.940 --> 02:37:35.060]  dude, I slept most of today.
[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:38.100]  And then I woke up, got a little bit more prepared for the cannabis cup.
[02:37:38.100 --> 02:37:42.740]  And then, uh, I drove up to Colorado Springs to see my buddy hydro.
[02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:46.660]  Uh, I've played hydro songs on the show before he does a secret cup anthem.
[02:37:46.660 --> 02:37:48.740]  I saw hydro, I saw pacifier.
[02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:50.020]  And that's funny.
[02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:55.060]  Now that I say it like pacifier, it's pass a fire, but I said pacifier like a baby fucking
[02:37:55.060 --> 02:37:55.540]  pacifier.
[02:37:55.540 --> 02:37:56.820]  That's funny when you say it that way.
[02:37:56.820 --> 02:37:58.580]  And fortunate youth at the black sheep.
[02:37:59.780 --> 02:38:04.180]  Uh, I'm kind of friends with hydro and I brought a bunch of pretty high quality concentrates
[02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:06.100]  with me and he, that dude travels.
[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:07.380]  He's been on tour with an email.
[02:38:07.380 --> 02:38:09.380]  He's got an email in the tour van.
[02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:12.020]  So he took me downstage at the black sheep and we just started dabbing.
[02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:12.260]  Right.
[02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:16.340]  And I'm dabbing and I noticed it was like six or eight, seven or 10 people that want to
[02:38:16.340 --> 02:38:18.020]  come around and take dabs with us.
[02:38:18.020 --> 02:38:19.380]  So I dab all these guys out.
[02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:20.420]  It was cool.
[02:38:20.420 --> 02:38:21.060]  They appreciate it.
[02:38:21.060 --> 02:38:21.860]  They're all super kind.
[02:38:21.860 --> 02:38:22.820]  We get dabbed the fuck out.
[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:26.820]  And then we go back upstairs from the black sheep and, uh, this band walks out and starts
[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:27.060]  playing.
[02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:30.260]  And I realized that's all the people that I just dabbed out and I was totally dabbing
[02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:32.180]  out all the bands and Hyrie also.
[02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:37.380]  So shout out to a super huge shout out to hydro, a shout out to pacifier, shout out
[02:38:37.380 --> 02:38:39.620]  to fortunate youth and a shout out to Hyrie.
[02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:42.100]  I got those guys high as shit tonight and it was fun.
[02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:43.540]  Uh, hope you guys enjoyed my concentrates.
[02:38:43.540 --> 02:38:45.860]  I got a lot of compliments on the black cherry cam.
[02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:48.340]  So big ups to all the reggae bands.
[02:38:48.340 --> 02:38:49.780]  My week is off to a great start.
[02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:53.220]  I'll brag more about my cannabis cup weekend on the next episode.
[02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:55.300]  Uh, that's enough of me rambling.
[02:38:55.300 --> 02:38:57.540]  Let's talk about some news articles.
[02:38:57.540 --> 02:38:58.500]  Where do you guys want to start?
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:38:59.940]  You want to start on the serious shit?
[02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:03.540]  Actually last week I told you we were going to talk about this edibles report and I skipped
[02:39:03.540 --> 02:39:04.580]  it because it was way too long.
[02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:05.380]  So let's get into that.
[02:39:06.340 --> 02:39:10.020]  This article is from the cannabis and it's by Ricardo Baca.
[02:39:10.020 --> 02:39:15.060]  The headline says special report 15 months in edibles, still a safety concern for Colorado.
[02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:17.860]  I'm going to take a quick drink of some root beer here and then we'll read the article.
[02:39:22.490 --> 02:39:23.610]  All right, that's delicious.
[02:39:24.410 --> 02:39:28.570]  It says a year of debate, a slew of labeling regulations and multiple educational campaigns
[02:39:28.570 --> 02:39:32.250]  have not been effective in answering a critical question surrounding marijuana infused edible
[02:39:32.250 --> 02:39:33.210]  products.
[02:39:33.210 --> 02:39:35.290]  How do you stop a consumer from eating too much?
[02:39:36.890 --> 02:39:38.490]  And then I like the way this is written.
[02:39:38.490 --> 02:39:41.290]  It's all like super impacted edibles.
[02:39:41.290 --> 02:39:45.850]  Once, once that to be the simple entry for those who wanted to try the newly legalized
[02:39:45.850 --> 02:39:49.930]  recreational drug have been implicated in two suicides and one murder in the past 13
[02:39:49.930 --> 02:39:50.730]  months.
[02:39:50.730 --> 02:39:55.130]  Only one edibles related death has been confirmed by officials, but the family of 22 year old
[02:39:55.130 --> 02:40:00.010]  Oklahoma tourist Luke Goodman, who fatally shot himself while on a March ski vacation
[02:40:00.010 --> 02:40:04.650]  in Keystone immediately blamed his death on the infused edibles he overindulged in that
[02:40:04.650 --> 02:40:04.890]  day.
[02:40:06.490 --> 02:40:08.250]  It was a hundred percent the drugs.
[02:40:08.250 --> 02:40:12.410]  Kim Goldman said at the time, acknowledging that her son didn't read the government mandated
[02:40:12.410 --> 02:40:16.970]  warnings on the packaging and ended up eating five times the state's recommended dose for
[02:40:16.970 --> 02:40:17.850]  edible cannabis.
[02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:20.730]  What's the recommended dose is a 25, I think.
[02:40:20.730 --> 02:40:23.130]  So that means he ate 125 milligrams.
[02:40:24.730 --> 02:40:28.170]  I had a hundred milligram clotted bear the other night and I was high.
[02:40:28.170 --> 02:40:32.970]  So if this dude doesn't do any cannabis consumption until this point, and he eats a hundred
[02:40:32.970 --> 02:40:35.930]  milligrams, he was probably pretty fucking high to tell you the truth.
[02:40:36.970 --> 02:40:40.890]  So then it goes on to say much of the regulatory debate around edibles has focused on preventing
[02:40:40.890 --> 02:40:45.210]  accidental ingestion, but the manner in which edibles affected person raises the question,
[02:40:45.210 --> 02:40:48.330]  whether more should be done to educate buyers before they leave the shop.
[02:40:48.890 --> 02:40:52.890]  There's a learning curve for consumers of edibles said art way, Colorado state director
[02:40:52.890 --> 02:40:55.530]  of pro legalization drug policy alliance.
[02:40:55.530 --> 02:40:58.250]  We cannot escape the issue of personal responsibility.
[02:40:58.250 --> 02:41:02.810]  That said the industry should do all that is reasonable in the formative years of marijuana
[02:41:02.810 --> 02:41:05.770]  legalization to combat concerns around edibles.
[02:41:07.050 --> 02:41:10.490]  Nearly 5 million edibles were sold in Colorado shops in 2014.
[02:41:10.890 --> 02:41:13.050]  Not only are edibles high.
[02:41:13.050 --> 02:41:13.290]  Okay.
[02:41:13.290 --> 02:41:14.330]  I'm going to try that sentence again.
[02:41:14.330 --> 02:41:17.930]  Not only are edibles high is more delayed and long lasting than smoking or vaporizing
[02:41:17.930 --> 02:41:22.090]  cannabis, but some brands continue to severely mismeasure their products potency.
[02:41:22.090 --> 02:41:27.610]  According to a new Denver post commissioned series of lab tests, measuring THCs in 10
[02:41:27.610 --> 02:41:28.810]  popular edibles.
[02:41:28.810 --> 02:41:32.090]  And you guys, you'll remember we did a report on that way in the infancy of this show.
[02:41:32.650 --> 02:41:35.770]  A bunch of the companies were making edibles.
[02:41:35.770 --> 02:41:39.450]  A random person bought them and took them to steep hill labs and things that were claiming
[02:41:39.450 --> 02:41:43.690]  to have a hundred milligrams were having 10 and then also maybe 200.
[02:41:43.690 --> 02:41:45.370]  So it was way off the chart.
[02:41:45.370 --> 02:41:49.130]  So it's hard to even say what some of these people ate when they got all fucked up and
[02:41:49.130 --> 02:41:50.010]  did stupid stuff.
[02:41:50.730 --> 02:41:52.090]  Where was I in the article?
[02:41:52.090 --> 02:41:52.890]  Here it is.
[02:41:53.690 --> 02:41:58.090]  Earlier this year, it seemed as if the state's legislative pot docket had calmed down after
[02:41:58.090 --> 02:42:03.770]  a busting a bustling 2014 of regulations and rulemaking for edibles alone, warning labels
[02:42:03.770 --> 02:42:05.930]  already had been standardized with more information.
[02:42:05.930 --> 02:42:11.850]  10 milligram doses of THC universally had become individually wrapped.
[02:42:11.850 --> 02:42:16.650]  The state was working on uniform lab testing standards and users encountered educational
[02:42:16.650 --> 02:42:21.290]  campaigns at every turn, movie theaters, pot shops, and interstate billboards.
[02:42:22.890 --> 02:42:26.330]  I think that when you're buying edibles, I think you should be given a pamphlet or something
[02:42:26.330 --> 02:42:29.770]  would be a good start because I've been to a hundred dispensaries.
[02:42:29.770 --> 02:42:35.690]  I work at a dispensary and the bud tender will say, Hey, this is serious.
[02:42:36.410 --> 02:42:37.290]  Take this seriously.
[02:42:37.290 --> 02:42:38.730]  And the people don't respect it.
[02:42:39.690 --> 02:42:40.890]  They just don't care.
[02:42:40.890 --> 02:42:44.570]  And so I think maybe if you gave them a little paper so that they could read it, most of
[02:42:44.570 --> 02:42:45.610]  them are going to throw it away.
[02:42:45.610 --> 02:42:50.090]  But at least we gave them that paper and gave them the opportunity to read it.
[02:42:50.090 --> 02:42:53.050]  Because when people talk, it's easy just to ignore us when we're at the shop.
[02:42:53.050 --> 02:42:55.770]  You're looking at all the buds, you're looking at all the concentrates, you're thinking about
[02:42:55.770 --> 02:42:56.810]  how much money you can spend.
[02:42:56.810 --> 02:42:57.770]  You're just excited.
[02:42:58.330 --> 02:42:59.850]  The money comes flying out of your pocket.
[02:42:59.850 --> 02:43:01.130]  You put the edibles right in your mouth.
[02:43:01.130 --> 02:43:01.850]  You don't even think.
[02:43:01.850 --> 02:43:04.730]  So I think if we gave you a little piece of paper to read and kind of showed you some
[02:43:04.730 --> 02:43:06.490]  shit, that might be a good start.
[02:43:06.490 --> 02:43:09.130]  Maybe make you sign something, but then people don't even want to fuck around.
[02:43:09.130 --> 02:43:10.810]  If you have to sign something at the dispensary.
[02:43:11.530 --> 02:43:13.930]  I remember the first time I bought a decade dose Chibu Chu.
[02:43:14.490 --> 02:43:16.010]  It was when they first, first came out.
[02:43:16.570 --> 02:43:20.170]  My friend had a shop and he invited me to get a decade dose and they made me sign a
[02:43:20.170 --> 02:43:21.930]  waiver to eat a decade dose Chibu Chu.
[02:43:21.930 --> 02:43:25.130]  I bought it and they actually made me eat it there because they didn't want me to give
[02:43:25.130 --> 02:43:25.770]  it to anybody.
[02:43:26.570 --> 02:43:28.650]  They told me to eat it there and I ate the whole thing in front of them.
[02:43:29.290 --> 02:43:30.730]  All right, I'm going to go on with the article here.
[02:43:31.290 --> 02:43:35.290]  It says in the wake of Goldman's death, many recalled 19 year old Wyoming college student,
[02:43:35.290 --> 02:43:39.610]  Levi Tombaugh, who became agitated after eating infused cookie with more than six times the
[02:43:39.610 --> 02:43:45.370]  state's recommended dose in March, 2014 and leapt to his death from a Denver hotel balcony.
[02:43:45.370 --> 02:43:50.170]  The Denver corner listed medical intoxication as a significant condition, contributing to
[02:43:50.170 --> 02:43:50.970]  Thomas death.
[02:43:51.610 --> 02:43:52.570]  Have you ever been so high?
[02:43:52.570 --> 02:43:54.010]  You wanted to jump off the balcony.
[02:43:54.810 --> 02:43:56.090]  That's fucking high.
[02:43:56.090 --> 02:43:59.930]  As the summit County corner awaits Goodman's toxicology reports in the coming weeks, his
[02:43:59.930 --> 02:44:04.010]  death, be it related to cannabis or not served as a reminder that the edibles conversation
[02:44:04.010 --> 02:44:05.530]  is anything but over.
[02:44:05.530 --> 02:44:09.530]  As we continue down this road, we really need to keep an open mind, said Louis Kosky, director
[02:44:09.530 --> 02:44:12.970]  of Colorado medical, Colorado's marijuana enforcement division.
[02:44:12.970 --> 02:44:16.330]  I'm going to continue to say medical marijuana enforcement division on accident because
[02:44:16.330 --> 02:44:17.530]  that's what it started off as.
[02:44:17.530 --> 02:44:22.330]  I think we have to consider various incidents that occur and work on putting them into
[02:44:22.330 --> 02:44:27.850]  perspective as in what things do we as regulators have control over to making things more
[02:44:27.850 --> 02:44:28.250]  efficient?
[02:44:28.810 --> 02:44:34.170]  Kosky looked to the edibles work group that met four times in 2014 to discuss making edibles
[02:44:34.170 --> 02:44:39.450]  clearly identifiable, improving and simplifying the labels on edibles, reminding consumers
[02:44:39.450 --> 02:44:43.610]  that a single dose is 10 milligrams and to wait one to two hours to feel the effect before
[02:44:43.610 --> 02:44:48.410]  ingesting more was discussed by the work group, which included state officials, pot shop owners,
[02:44:48.410 --> 02:44:51.770]  representatives from edibles, kitchens and children's health advocates.
[02:44:54.170 --> 02:44:55.210]  Too much, too fast.
[02:44:55.290 --> 02:44:59.930]  The new rules are due January 1st, but while these regulations might help curb accidental
[02:44:59.930 --> 02:45:03.690]  ingestions, it remains unclear if they will stop individuals from eating too much, too
[02:45:03.690 --> 02:45:04.570]  fast.
[02:45:04.570 --> 02:45:09.050]  Prominent Denver pot shop owner in Sieb pointed to Goodman suicide to illustrate how much
[02:45:09.050 --> 02:45:14.170]  tragedies can always be prevented by the state, the industry and the regulations they draft.
[02:45:14.170 --> 02:45:18.730]  At no point do I feel the retailer who sold the cannabis is responsible for his death,
[02:45:18.730 --> 02:45:23.930]  said Sieb, co-owner of Denver relief and chair of the national Cannabis Industry Association.
[02:45:23.930 --> 02:45:28.090]  I'm not a parent, but I was disappointed because I know that if I have a friend or
[02:45:28.090 --> 02:45:32.170]  family member who's rambling incoherently and not acting himself, I'm not leaving that
[02:45:32.170 --> 02:45:33.450]  person alone.
[02:45:33.450 --> 02:45:37.530]  Sieb referred to Goodman's family who said he was acting erratically and he didn't recognize
[02:45:37.530 --> 02:45:39.530]  our presence almost.
[02:45:39.530 --> 02:45:44.010]  I had never seen him like this, but they still chose to leave him alone in the condo as they
[02:45:44.010 --> 02:45:46.570]  went to the hot tub, according to reports.
[02:45:46.570 --> 02:45:49.210]  So this dude was freaking out on a cannabis edible, you guys.
[02:45:49.770 --> 02:45:53.770]  And what he did was walked into the room and shot himself and killed himself.
[02:45:54.490 --> 02:45:58.810]  And that's kind of what sparked a lot of the re-examination of the cannabis edible rules.
[02:45:59.450 --> 02:46:01.050]  So here's what I want to say.
[02:46:01.050 --> 02:46:04.010]  If you come to Colorado and you eat some edibles, respect that shit.
[02:46:04.010 --> 02:46:04.730]  It is serious.
[02:46:04.730 --> 02:46:06.970]  These aren't the brownies that your sister used to make.
[02:46:06.970 --> 02:46:09.850]  These aren't the cookies that your mom used to make back in the 70s.
[02:46:10.410 --> 02:46:13.370]  These are lab tested edibles made by professionals.
[02:46:14.010 --> 02:46:20.010]  This started being made for medical patients that had cancer, Crohn's disease, severe pain,
[02:46:20.010 --> 02:46:21.130]  cachexia.
[02:46:21.130 --> 02:46:24.170]  We needed a way to get these people well, and we weren't fucking around.
[02:46:24.170 --> 02:46:26.410]  So we figured out ways to make these edibles right.
[02:46:26.410 --> 02:46:29.530]  You guys that are not taking it seriously, you're going to get fucked up and you're going
[02:46:29.530 --> 02:46:31.130]  to be on the news and we're going to laugh at you.
[02:46:32.250 --> 02:46:34.330]  And then you're going to mess up our laws on our edibles.
[02:46:34.330 --> 02:46:37.850]  I want to see how far we are into the show and I'm going to read a couple more articles.
[02:46:38.650 --> 02:46:39.850]  Oh dude, we're 22 minutes in.
[02:46:39.850 --> 02:46:41.530]  We might get another article, maybe two.
[02:46:42.490 --> 02:46:43.130]  Let's see.
[02:46:44.010 --> 02:46:44.490]  Let's see.
[02:46:44.490 --> 02:46:45.050]  Let's see.
[02:46:45.690 --> 02:46:47.450]  I really want to make sure we get this one in.
[02:46:47.450 --> 02:46:49.770]  So we're just going to skip that one and read this one.
[02:46:51.050 --> 02:46:52.650]  Excuse me for all the throat clearing guys.
[02:46:52.650 --> 02:46:55.050]  Like I've said, if you come be on the show, I have someone to talk to and then you can
[02:46:55.050 --> 02:46:56.170]  talk while I clear my throat.
[02:46:57.210 --> 02:47:00.250]  This article is going to piss you off.
[02:47:00.250 --> 02:47:01.930]  This one I found, where's this from?
[02:47:01.930 --> 02:47:04.890]  World news daily report.com.
[02:47:05.850 --> 02:47:08.490]  And the article is written by Bob Flanagan and it said,
[02:47:08.490 --> 02:47:12.810]  Monsanto creates first genetically modified strain of marijuana.
[02:47:14.090 --> 02:47:19.130]  Says St. Louis, Missouri, Monsanto, the multi-billion agribusiness giant has announced
[02:47:19.130 --> 02:47:23.450]  today it has patented the first genetically modified strain of marijuana.
[02:47:24.410 --> 02:47:26.330]  Right now Monsanto is a breeder.
[02:47:26.330 --> 02:47:28.890]  What the hell are they going to be at the cup selling seeds?
[02:47:28.890 --> 02:47:29.930]  No, it's not like that.
[02:47:30.490 --> 02:47:31.770]  Let me read this article for you.
[02:47:33.130 --> 02:47:36.970]  It says, the news that has been welcomed by scientists and leaders of the agriculture
[02:47:36.970 --> 02:47:40.810]  business alike, as it moved forward toward the industrial use of marijuana and hemp
[02:47:40.810 --> 02:47:45.130]  products could bring a major shift towards marijuana policies in the USA and ultimately
[02:47:45.130 --> 02:47:45.850]  to the world.
[02:47:46.490 --> 02:47:53.290]  Under present U.S. federal law, it is illegal to possess, use, buy, sell, or cultivate marijuana.
[02:47:53.850 --> 02:47:59.370]  Since the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a schedule one drug,
[02:47:59.370 --> 02:48:04.570]  although it has been decriminalized to some extent in certain states.
[02:48:04.570 --> 02:48:09.210]  Monsanto's interest in the field has been interpreted by experts as the precursor to
[02:48:09.210 --> 02:48:11.930]  a major shift in marijuana policy in the U.S.
[02:48:11.930 --> 02:48:17.690]  That is, as it is believed, the company would not have invested so much time and energy
[02:48:17.690 --> 02:48:22.170]  if it not had previous knowledge of the federal government's openness toward the future
[02:48:22.170 --> 02:48:23.770]  legalization of marijuana.
[02:48:23.770 --> 02:48:24.490]  Damn, that was hard to read.
[02:48:24.490 --> 02:48:25.130]  I'm sorry, you guys.
[02:48:26.890 --> 02:48:30.890]  Lawyer and marijuana law specialist Edmund Gronch of the Drug Policy Alliance admits
[02:48:30.890 --> 02:48:35.770]  Monsanto's involvement in marijuana projects could definitely help the pro-legalization
[02:48:35.770 --> 02:48:36.730]  activists.
[02:48:36.730 --> 02:48:41.370]  Currently, federal law criminalizes marijuana and hemp derivatives because public opinion
[02:48:41.370 --> 02:48:45.050]  is still against it and legal commercial production in the U.S. is currently handled by a
[02:48:45.050 --> 02:48:48.570]  patchwork of small farmers whom are not trusted by investors.
[02:48:48.570 --> 02:48:52.970]  A major player as Monsanto could bring confidence within government and towards investors in
[02:48:52.970 --> 02:48:58.730]  the market if it were to own a large part of the exploitable lands and commercial products.
[02:48:59.210 --> 02:49:01.770]  That is partly accurate, but I hate that.
[02:49:01.770 --> 02:49:02.730]  All right, let me keep reading.
[02:49:02.730 --> 02:49:05.930]  There is presently no way to control the production of marijuana and the quality of the
[02:49:05.930 --> 02:49:06.730]  strains.
[02:49:06.730 --> 02:49:12.170]  A GM strain produced by a company with the credentials and prestige of Monsanto would
[02:49:12.170 --> 02:49:17.610]  definitely lend a massive hand to pro-legalization activists with the certain spheres of government
[02:49:17.610 --> 02:49:20.090]  and within the business world, he explains.
[02:49:20.090 --> 02:49:23.770]  I'm fired up because I'm a cannabis breeder and they're talking shit saying that, I don't
[02:49:23.770 --> 02:49:25.530]  know, I'm not trustable.
[02:49:25.610 --> 02:49:30.330]  I'm not trustable, but if you use Monsanto because they've got credentials and prestige
[02:49:30.330 --> 02:49:32.570]  that people are going to trust that shit.
[02:49:32.570 --> 02:49:34.330]  It's true, but that sucks.
[02:49:34.330 --> 02:49:37.690]  Just because I've got dreadlocks and red eyes doesn't mean I'm not trustable and credible.
[02:49:38.330 --> 02:49:41.770]  All right, it goes on to say, although Monsanto's testing on cannabis is only at an
[02:49:41.770 --> 02:49:46.810]  experimental stage, no plan has yet been released by the agricultural business firm as to what
[02:49:46.810 --> 02:49:48.810]  purposes the patent strain would be used for.
[02:49:48.810 --> 02:49:52.970]  Although specialists believe answers should come this fall as rumors of a controversial
[02:49:52.970 --> 02:49:57.210]  new bill, which could loosen up laws around medical marijuana is reportedly scheduled
[02:49:57.210 --> 02:49:59.130]  to pass before Congress coming this fall.
[02:49:59.690 --> 02:50:04.250]  Critics fear genetically modified cannabis will mix with other strains and could destroy
[02:50:04.250 --> 02:50:09.850]  the diversity of DNA, a reality dismissed by most studies claim experts.
[02:50:11.130 --> 02:50:14.330]  I've got my own feelings about this because I'm a breeder and...
[02:50:16.730 --> 02:50:20.570]  All right, so I think Monsanto is going to find a strain or use a strain that someone
[02:50:20.570 --> 02:50:23.450]  they know has been working with, and they're going to figure out ways to manipulate the
[02:50:23.450 --> 02:50:27.850]  genetic makeup of that plant to tweak it to be pest and mold resistant and grow the most
[02:50:27.850 --> 02:50:30.010]  desirable sets of traits a grower could want, right?
[02:50:30.010 --> 02:50:30.650]  That would be neat.
[02:50:30.650 --> 02:50:31.370]  That would be ideal.
[02:50:32.010 --> 02:50:36.170]  So let's see them breed a high CBD strain that everybody could grow.
[02:50:36.170 --> 02:50:36.730]  You know what I mean?
[02:50:36.730 --> 02:50:41.050]  Wouldn't that be awesome if Monsanto made a high CBD, low THC strain that you could put
[02:50:41.050 --> 02:50:42.970]  in your front yard and grow right next to your shrubs?
[02:50:43.530 --> 02:50:44.410]  That would be awesome, right?
[02:50:45.210 --> 02:50:47.370]  They could grow worldwide, be pennies a pound, right?
[02:50:47.370 --> 02:50:50.170]  But fucking no, that's not what Monsanto does.
[02:50:50.330 --> 02:50:52.810]  It's what they could do, but they're the fucking devil, so they don't.
[02:50:52.810 --> 02:50:55.610]  Unfortunately, I think this is what's going to happen.
[02:50:55.610 --> 02:50:56.410]  I thought about this.
[02:50:56.410 --> 02:50:59.610]  I think it's going to lead to a commercialized strain that will definitely suck.
[02:50:59.610 --> 02:51:01.130]  It's going to be like cigarettes.
[02:51:01.130 --> 02:51:01.610]  You know what I mean?
[02:51:01.610 --> 02:51:05.450]  Back in the day, tobacco probably smelled and tastes good, and now it just smells like
[02:51:05.450 --> 02:51:07.130]  fucking car exhaust because it's half crap.
[02:51:07.690 --> 02:51:09.370]  That's what I think they're going to do with cannabis.
[02:51:10.810 --> 02:51:12.410]  It'll probably be terrible.
[02:51:12.410 --> 02:51:17.130]  I think a big part of why people choose to medicate themselves with medical cannabis
[02:51:17.130 --> 02:51:20.970]  is because we don't want GMOs and dangerous shit put into our bodies as medicine.
[02:51:20.970 --> 02:51:25.610]  We've chosen to grow our own cannabis or rely on a trustworthy caregiver like myself to
[02:51:25.610 --> 02:51:30.010]  grow the medical cannabis for us so we don't have to buy pills and shit from a company.
[02:51:30.650 --> 02:51:33.770]  It was only a matter of time before Monsanto came into the cannabis game.
[02:51:33.770 --> 02:51:35.690]  So here's my big conclusion on all this.
[02:51:35.690 --> 02:51:38.410]  I wrote down some notes, and I'm just reading a little bullet points right now.
[02:51:38.410 --> 02:51:42.730]  I see Monsanto teaming up with Big Pharma, someone creating a medical cannabis program,
[02:51:42.730 --> 02:51:46.330]  and Monsanto having the only plants in that national medical cannabis garden.
[02:51:47.290 --> 02:51:48.410]  That's how that shit works.
[02:51:50.650 --> 02:51:56.090]  So they'll own the patents on the seeds, so nobody else can grow those seeds without
[02:51:56.090 --> 02:51:57.050]  Monsanto permission.
[02:51:57.050 --> 02:51:59.370]  You'll have to buy the seeds from Monsanto.
[02:51:59.370 --> 02:52:03.210]  They'll also have the monopoly by being the only strains that are available in these medically
[02:52:03.210 --> 02:52:04.250]  regulated stores.
[02:52:04.970 --> 02:52:06.170]  So that's kind of what I think.
[02:52:06.170 --> 02:52:08.490]  They'll set up a national medical marijuana program.
[02:52:08.490 --> 02:52:10.090]  They'll be like, oh, you guys want legalized weed?
[02:52:10.090 --> 02:52:12.170]  Here you go, nationally legalized.
[02:52:12.170 --> 02:52:13.850]  And then they're going to say, where's the weed going to come from?
[02:52:13.850 --> 02:52:15.530]  They'll say, we'll supply it.
[02:52:15.530 --> 02:52:16.650]  We're going to say, who's going to grow it?
[02:52:16.650 --> 02:52:19.290]  And they're going to go, dun, dun, dun, Monsanto.
[02:52:20.170 --> 02:52:22.250]  And we're going to get that Monsanto OG.
[02:52:22.970 --> 02:52:24.010]  Yeah, that's what you want, right?
[02:52:24.010 --> 02:52:27.050]  That big 12% THC plant, right?
[02:52:27.050 --> 02:52:27.930]  It's going to be terrible.
[02:52:27.930 --> 02:52:28.730]  That's what I predict.
[02:52:28.730 --> 02:52:29.770]  That's what I see coming.
[02:52:30.330 --> 02:52:31.210]  It's going to get creepy.
[02:52:32.570 --> 02:52:33.690]  You know how to prevent that, right?
[02:52:33.690 --> 02:52:35.290]  You guys all have to start growing.
[02:52:35.290 --> 02:52:36.730]  Start growing cannabis.
[02:52:36.730 --> 02:52:37.530]  Grow your own.
[02:52:38.970 --> 02:52:42.250]  It sounds expensive, and it seems like a lot of work, but to grow your own cannabis to
[02:52:42.250 --> 02:52:43.850]  be self-sufficient is not that hard.
[02:52:43.850 --> 02:52:47.050]  Whatever you're paying for an ounce right now, if you're buying it on the street, if
[02:52:47.050 --> 02:52:52.250]  you're buying it at a dispensary, you can get better, safer, cheaper cannabis by growing
[02:52:52.250 --> 02:52:52.810]  your own.
[02:52:53.850 --> 02:52:54.810]  I know where to get some seeds.
[02:52:54.810 --> 02:52:56.650]  You go to naturesgreenremedies.com.
[02:52:57.210 --> 02:52:57.850]  Do that.
[02:52:57.850 --> 02:53:03.290]  So never support any Monsanto companies or their subsidiaries.
[02:53:03.290 --> 02:53:03.850]  Never.
[02:53:03.850 --> 02:53:10.570]  Scott's, fucking all that stuff that is available commercially is mostly Monsanto, like all
[02:53:10.570 --> 02:53:11.610]  your gardening products.
[02:53:11.610 --> 02:53:13.050]  That's mostly Monsanto shit.
[02:53:13.050 --> 02:53:17.290]  Scott's Turf Builder, all the Miracle-Gro stuff, that is all Monsanto shit.
[02:53:17.290 --> 02:53:22.090]  All of the bug sprays and shit you see at all your local hardware stores, mostly Monsanto
[02:53:22.090 --> 02:53:22.490]  products.
[02:53:22.490 --> 02:53:24.010]  Try to avoid that shit if you can.
[02:53:24.970 --> 02:53:29.530]  Also, there is a March on Monsanto on May 23rd across the world.
[02:53:30.730 --> 02:53:32.250]  Google that, March on Monsanto.
[02:53:32.250 --> 02:53:33.610]  Be a part of that if you want.
[02:53:33.610 --> 02:53:38.490]  People go out and march in the streets and talk about how they do not want these genetically
[02:53:38.490 --> 02:53:42.730]  modified products on the shelves in our stores, and they do not want Monsanto taking over
[02:53:42.730 --> 02:53:43.530]  our food supply.
[02:53:44.250 --> 02:53:44.490]  All right.
[02:53:44.490 --> 02:53:45.770]  I could rant on that for days.
[02:53:45.770 --> 02:53:48.330]  I'll definitely be keeping a personal eye on this topic.
[02:53:48.970 --> 02:53:49.370]  Let's see.
[02:53:49.370 --> 02:53:50.730]  I got more news I want to talk about.
[02:53:50.730 --> 02:53:52.650]  I want to check in and see how long we've been recording.
[02:53:52.650 --> 02:53:53.450]  I don't want to go too long.
[02:53:53.450 --> 02:53:55.290]  Here, you guys get fucking ADD on me.
[02:53:56.170 --> 02:53:56.650]  30 minutes.
[02:53:56.650 --> 02:53:58.730]  Let's read one more quick, quick news article.
[02:53:58.730 --> 02:53:59.690]  I got a quickie here.
[02:54:00.650 --> 02:54:01.610]  You guys will like this one.
[02:54:01.610 --> 02:54:06.810]  The DEA is not only seizing less cannabis, they're asking to increase their legal growth
[02:54:06.810 --> 02:54:08.410]  three times for medical research.
[02:54:08.410 --> 02:54:10.330]  This article comes from the Leafly.
[02:54:10.330 --> 02:54:11.530]  And who is it written by?
[02:54:11.530 --> 02:54:12.410]  Who gets credit here?
[02:54:12.410 --> 02:54:13.210]  Nobody gets credit.
[02:54:13.930 --> 02:54:14.970]  Nope, no name on it.
[02:54:14.970 --> 02:54:18.570]  So just the Leafly is all or Leafly.com.
[02:54:18.570 --> 02:54:22.730]  It says the Drug Enforcement Administration is seizing less cannabis year over year, according
[02:54:22.730 --> 02:54:23.850]  to its own records.
[02:54:23.850 --> 02:54:31.050]  In 2009, the agency confiscated and destroyed 10.4 million cannabis plants, whereas in 2013,
[02:54:31.050 --> 02:54:33.370]  the numbers fell to 4.4 million.
[02:54:33.370 --> 02:54:36.330]  And last year, the DEA seized 4.3 million.
[02:54:37.050 --> 02:54:41.290]  The steady decline can be attributed to fewer funds being made available for enforcement,
[02:54:41.290 --> 02:54:45.690]  partly due to the economic recession and partly because both the public and government
[02:54:45.690 --> 02:54:48.650]  stance on cannabis has softened considerably over the years.
[02:54:49.930 --> 02:54:54.330]  With more states looking to legalize in the next few years, as well as less funding being
[02:54:54.330 --> 02:54:59.370]  generated from local and state police asset seizures, the downward trend should continue.
[02:54:59.370 --> 02:55:03.690]  Meanwhile, the DEA is shifting from the ones doing the confiscating to the ones doing the
[02:55:03.690 --> 02:55:04.490]  growing.
[02:55:04.490 --> 02:55:07.930]  The administration has proposed to increase the amount of cannabis it's legally allowed
[02:55:07.930 --> 02:55:14.170]  to produce by more than 300% in order to meet the demands of researchers who are studying
[02:55:14.170 --> 02:55:17.370]  the potential medical benefits the plant has to offer.
[02:55:18.090 --> 02:55:22.570]  If it sounds weird that the DEA is simultaneously seizing cannabis grows and growing their own
[02:55:22.570 --> 02:55:24.730]  plants for research purposes, well, it is.
[02:55:24.730 --> 02:55:25.610]  And I fucking agree.
[02:55:25.610 --> 02:55:28.170]  That's not only weird, that's hypocritical.
[02:55:28.890 --> 02:55:33.290]  But hopefully we'll continue to see the DEA shift its focus to regulating the legal market
[02:55:33.290 --> 02:55:37.850]  and focusing their efforts on illegal grows and activity that damages the positive progress
[02:55:37.930 --> 02:55:39.530]  the industry is making.
[02:55:39.530 --> 02:55:43.290]  Besides, we do need more cannabis research to help propel the industry forward.
[02:55:43.290 --> 02:55:48.330]  So if the DEA can make it happen, the administration is actually doing something positive for the
[02:55:48.330 --> 02:55:49.370]  cannabis community.
[02:55:49.930 --> 02:55:50.650]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:55:51.690 --> 02:55:54.650]  If they get more money for more research, hopefully they do the right thing with the
[02:55:54.650 --> 02:55:55.050]  research.
[02:55:55.050 --> 02:55:59.290]  Hopefully they're not trying to prove that it's making people retarded or making fucking
[02:55:59.290 --> 02:56:00.330]  people turn into zombies.
[02:56:00.330 --> 02:56:03.290]  Hopefully they're actually trying to research that it helps with cancer.
[02:56:03.290 --> 02:56:04.650]  It helps with seizures.
[02:56:04.650 --> 02:56:05.850]  It helps with nausea.
[02:56:05.850 --> 02:56:07.290]  It helps with depression.
[02:56:07.370 --> 02:56:08.970]  It really helps with PTSD.
[02:56:08.970 --> 02:56:14.330]  It pisses me off that in Colorado, PTSD is not a qualifying condition to get your medical
[02:56:14.330 --> 02:56:15.370]  marijuana recommendation.
[02:56:15.370 --> 02:56:16.570]  That's really frustrating to me.
[02:56:18.010 --> 02:56:20.650]  All right, that's the last news article I want to read.
[02:56:20.650 --> 02:56:22.650]  I'm going to close up all the news here.
[02:56:23.370 --> 02:56:24.730]  What else do we got?
[02:56:24.730 --> 02:56:26.090]  We talked about the news.
[02:56:26.650 --> 02:56:27.210]  I did that.
[02:56:27.210 --> 02:56:27.930]  I talked about that.
[02:56:27.930 --> 02:56:28.650]  I talked about that.
[02:56:28.650 --> 02:56:29.850]  I did that one.
[02:56:29.850 --> 02:56:30.330]  All right.
[02:56:30.330 --> 02:56:31.290]  Oh, the growers meeting.
[02:56:31.290 --> 02:56:33.210]  That's what I want to remind you about.
[02:56:33.210 --> 02:56:36.970]  April 26th at Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies at 6 PM.
[02:56:36.970 --> 02:56:38.170]  There will be a growers meeting.
[02:56:38.170 --> 02:56:38.810]  I will be there.
[02:56:38.810 --> 02:56:39.690]  Jesse will be there.
[02:56:40.250 --> 02:56:42.650]  A lot of the people that have been on the podcast will be there.
[02:56:42.650 --> 02:56:44.250]  Spence usually shows up.
[02:56:44.250 --> 02:56:45.290]  White Mike shows up.
[02:56:46.090 --> 02:56:47.770]  Adam will be there because he doesn't have a wife.
[02:56:47.770 --> 02:56:48.650]  What's up, Adam?
[02:56:48.650 --> 02:56:49.930]  Can't wait to see you there, bro.
[02:56:49.930 --> 02:56:51.370]  Maybe we can get some chicks to come.
[02:56:51.370 --> 02:56:52.330]  Female growers.
[02:56:52.330 --> 02:56:53.930]  I didn't just mean to call you chicks.
[02:56:53.930 --> 02:56:54.730]  Lady growers.
[02:56:55.290 --> 02:56:56.090]  Come join us, dude.
[02:56:56.090 --> 02:56:56.730]  Don't be shy.
[02:56:56.730 --> 02:57:00.570]  There's always one lady grower there and then the two ladies that work at the grow shop.
[02:57:00.570 --> 02:57:02.490]  We want more ladies to come join the grow team.
[02:57:03.050 --> 02:57:06.010]  There's actually a news article about women and growing that I want to read on a future
[02:57:06.010 --> 02:57:06.490]  episode.
[02:57:07.290 --> 02:57:08.890]  I just don't have time today.
[02:57:10.490 --> 02:57:11.610]  What else do we got going on?
[02:57:11.610 --> 02:57:13.130]  Come to the grow meeting, April 26th.
[02:57:13.130 --> 02:57:13.850]  You'll learn something.
[02:57:13.850 --> 02:57:19.290]  I'm going to talk about grow schedules, like keeping your grow rooms organized and moving
[02:57:19.290 --> 02:57:21.210]  so that you don't have dead time in one of your rooms.
[02:57:21.210 --> 02:57:23.610]  I'm also going to use that for a future podcast.
[02:57:24.330 --> 02:57:26.970]  Also, we're going to talk about improving your crops on a future podcast.
[02:57:26.970 --> 02:57:30.970]  We'll get Jesse back for more outdoor stuff and, of course, more organics with Sean.
[02:57:30.970 --> 02:57:33.050]  I got a lot of great episodes planned for you guys.
[02:57:33.050 --> 02:57:36.090]  The next episode will be the Cannabis Cup review.
[02:57:36.970 --> 02:57:38.330]  Oh, man, it's going to be so great.
[02:57:38.330 --> 02:57:39.130]  I cannot wait.
[02:57:40.010 --> 02:57:42.410]  All right, let's get to the shout outs and start wrapping up the show.
[02:57:42.410 --> 02:57:44.330]  It's almost time for the end of this party.
[02:57:45.130 --> 02:57:45.850]  Almost time.
[02:57:45.850 --> 02:57:47.370]  Shout out to who do I owe a shout out to?
[02:57:47.370 --> 02:57:52.330]  Let's give a big shout out to HippieNurse710, Chris Casas, Jibbs, and the whole crew from
[02:57:52.330 --> 02:57:53.210]  last night.
[02:57:53.210 --> 02:57:59.770]  Also, a big shout out to Hydro, Pacifia, Fortunate Youth, Hyree, and what's up, Kevin?
[02:57:59.770 --> 02:58:01.610]  It was good bumping into you and taking some dabs, bro.
[02:58:02.170 --> 02:58:03.450]  Taking care of everybody like that.
[02:58:04.330 --> 02:58:06.730]  We didn't have a spot to plug in the email in this club.
[02:58:07.770 --> 02:58:10.410]  They didn't have any damn three-prong outlet spots.
[02:58:11.130 --> 02:58:12.970]  So we got an extension cord.
[02:58:12.970 --> 02:58:14.010]  That didn't work.
[02:58:14.010 --> 02:58:15.450]  We found another room.
[02:58:15.450 --> 02:58:18.010]  We dabbed out that room, but then we quickly got kicked out of there.
[02:58:18.010 --> 02:58:19.770]  We weren't allowed to dab in that room.
[02:58:19.770 --> 02:58:22.570]  Luckily, Kevin had a torch and a rig in his car, and it was close.
[02:58:22.570 --> 02:58:24.010]  So Kevin saved the day.
[02:58:24.010 --> 02:58:24.890]  We got to dab out.
[02:58:25.450 --> 02:58:26.730]  Big up for that.
[02:58:26.730 --> 02:58:27.850]  Let's wrap up the show, you guys.
[02:58:27.850 --> 02:58:28.490]  Thanks for listening.
[02:58:28.490 --> 02:58:29.050]  I'll be back.
[02:58:29.370 --> 02:58:34.330]  I'm really not going to put out another episode until Monday, the 27th, I think it'll be.
[02:58:34.970 --> 02:58:36.410]  So I'll see you on the 27th.
[02:58:36.410 --> 02:58:39.370]  Don't forget to check out our sponsors, the Rocky Mountain Worm Company, Hygro Indoor

[02:59:04.010 --> 02:59:05.210]  I need attention.
[02:59:05.210 --> 02:59:07.530]  iReed Genetics is now on Mass Roots if you're into that.
[02:59:08.730 --> 02:59:10.810]  If people don't start following me or something, I'm going to quit posting.

[02:59:43.290 --> 02:59:45.210]  I think that's all I got for you this week, you guys.
[02:59:45.850 --> 02:59:47.210]  Big old shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:59:47.210 --> 02:59:48.730]  Dude, those slabs are fire.
[02:59:49.530 --> 02:59:50.490]  Man, that's what's up.
[02:59:50.490 --> 02:59:52.650]  You got a lot of compliments on your hash work today, Spence.
[02:59:53.610 --> 02:59:55.450]  Hydro and the band really appreciated it.
[02:59:55.450 --> 02:59:56.650]  So big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:59:56.650 --> 02:59:57.930]  Thanks again for listening.
[02:59:57.930 --> 02:59:59.930]  Until next time, take a fat dab.
[02:59:59.930 --> 03:00:01.050]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[03:00:33.550 --> 03:00:34.510]  And I'll give math.
[03:00:34.510 --> 03:00:35.550]  We'll just recognize.
[03:00:35.550 --> 03:00:36.510]  Take notes.
[03:00:36.510 --> 03:00:37.550]  Well, I take the toast.
[03:00:37.550 --> 03:00:38.990]  You clowns are fake jokes.
[03:00:38.990 --> 03:00:41.470]  When it comes to this, I'm sharp and clear as a diamond.
[03:00:41.470 --> 03:00:42.270]  I hear the bottom.
[03:00:42.270 --> 03:00:43.550]  No, I'm educating.
[03:00:43.550 --> 03:00:47.470]  Refine them that will evade where your mind is because so many of your models from media
[03:00:47.470 --> 03:00:51.470]  trying to blind us, paid off by corporate giants, basic modern day tyrants, vultures,
[03:00:51.470 --> 03:00:52.190]  soaring and blind.
[03:00:52.190 --> 03:00:53.630]  So take notice, stay focused.
[03:00:53.630 --> 03:00:54.830]  Don't be ignoring the problems.
[03:01:03.630 --> 03:01:04.510]  It's not right.
[03:01:04.510 --> 03:01:06.110]  99% losing.
[03:01:15.670 --> 03:01:16.790]  All right, podcast world.
[03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:19.030]  I want to thank you once again for listening to a long episode.
[03:01:19.030 --> 03:01:22.310]  I would love to hear your opinions of these throwback Thursday episodes.
[03:01:22.310 --> 03:01:23.830]  I would love it if you send me a tweet.
[03:01:23.830 --> 03:01:27.270]  It's at GFYH podcast on Twitter, or you can send me an email.
[03:01:27.270 --> 03:01:29.990]  It's a girl from your heart at hotmail.com.
[03:01:29.990 --> 03:01:32.710]  Ladies and gentlemen, I will be back Monday with the brand new episode.
[03:01:32.710 --> 03:01:36.150]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
