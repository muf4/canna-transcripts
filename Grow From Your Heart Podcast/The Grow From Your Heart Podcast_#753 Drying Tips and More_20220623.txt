[00:00.000 --> 00:10.760]  Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:10.760 --> 00:11.760]  I'm your host.
[00:11.760 --> 00:13.440]  My friends call me Ross DeGeff.
[00:13.440 --> 00:18.560]  This is episode 753 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:18.560 --> 00:22.120]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of emails before I get to that part of the
[00:22.120 --> 00:23.120]  show.
[00:23.120 --> 00:27.400]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks who continue to support the show
[00:27.400 --> 00:29.020]  on Patreon.
[00:29.040 --> 00:33.140]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to my friend
[00:33.140 --> 00:35.060]  Pro Brewer Home Grower.
[00:35.060 --> 00:38.140]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to my Canadian buddy Tonto.
[00:38.140 --> 00:39.940]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Uncle Gigi.

[01:03.120 --> 01:06.800]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to a grower who has improved a long way over the
[01:06.800 --> 01:09.760]  long time we've been hanging out, my buddy Chicago Dabber.
[01:09.760 --> 01:13.680]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:13.680 --> 01:16.200]  to my friend Fiskles Organics.
[01:16.200 --> 01:21.160]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:21.160 --> 01:24.800]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:24.800 --> 01:31.120]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:31.120 --> 01:34.780]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen and you know I do include
[01:34.780 --> 01:39.200]  a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it super easy for all
[01:39.200 --> 01:43.600]  of my friends to support the show on Patreon.
[01:43.600 --> 01:47.280]  All right before we get too far I do want to start off by thanking everybody for the
[01:47.280 --> 01:52.440]  amazing and overwhelming support for the launch of the Irie Direct website.
[01:52.440 --> 01:56.680]  That's right if you've been following along you know that I did recently launch Irie Direct.
[01:56.680 --> 02:01.540]  If you go to my website www.iriegenetics.com there is a tab for the Irie Direct link.
[02:01.540 --> 02:04.320]  Click on that and it will take you right to the direct link.
[02:04.320 --> 02:08.920]  Thank you to everybody who has ordered, who has supported, who has sent advice, questions
[02:08.920 --> 02:09.920]  and tips.
[02:09.920 --> 02:11.120]  That is a brand new setup.
[02:11.120 --> 02:12.960]  That is a brand new web store.
[02:12.960 --> 02:16.680]  We are working out a couple of kinks but I think things are going quite smoothly for
[02:16.680 --> 02:18.520]  how new and how busy it was.
[02:18.520 --> 02:20.960]  I think we got it pretty much under control.
[02:20.960 --> 02:22.840]  Please be patient while we do work out some kinks.
[02:22.840 --> 02:26.480]  If you ordered and it took a minute to get a response or get the details you needed I
[02:26.480 --> 02:27.480]  do apologize.
[02:27.480 --> 02:31.600]  I think at this point we've got most of those kinks worked out but once again it is a new
[02:31.600 --> 02:33.720]  website it is a new service.
[02:33.720 --> 02:36.120]  Please bear with me while we get that going.
[02:36.120 --> 02:38.720]  Also a lot of people have told me that things are sold out.
[02:38.720 --> 02:41.840]  Yes I only put enough things on there that I can manage.
[02:41.840 --> 02:45.080]  It is mostly me doing that so I've got to be able to manage those orders.
[02:45.080 --> 02:46.280]  I am a busy person.
[02:46.280 --> 02:49.520]  I only put as much on there as I think I can fulfill.
[02:49.520 --> 02:50.640]  Most things are sold out.
[02:51.320 --> 02:55.200]  By the time I get done recording, by the time this comes out I will be putting restocks
[02:55.200 --> 02:56.200]  on iRedirect.
[02:56.200 --> 03:01.400]  So if you've been looking for something, waiting for new shit, go check now at the iRedirect
[03:01.400 --> 03:02.400]  link.
[03:02.400 --> 03:03.400]  We've been rambling enough about that.
[03:03.400 --> 03:06.040]  Let's talk about the next order of business.
[03:06.040 --> 03:12.360]  Ladies and gentlemen I look forward to joining you at the Dude Grows Growers Cup in Fort
[03:12.360 --> 03:15.000]  Collins on July 30th.
[03:15.000 --> 03:16.000]  That is a Saturday.
[03:16.000 --> 03:17.360]  The event does start at 2pm.
[03:17.360 --> 03:18.960]  It goes until 8pm.
[03:18.960 --> 03:20.720]  There will be a smoking competition.
[03:20.720 --> 03:22.360]  I've talked about this before.
[03:22.360 --> 03:23.520]  We will recap quickly.
[03:23.520 --> 03:27.120]  This is a cup event where growers will bring their flowers.
[03:27.120 --> 03:32.400]  The attendees will get to consume those flowers and taste them and judge them and vote on
[03:32.400 --> 03:37.080]  who grew and brought the best flowers to the DGC Growers Cup.
[03:37.080 --> 03:38.080]  I will be there.
[03:38.080 --> 03:40.080]  A bunch of other great breeders will be there.
[03:40.080 --> 03:44.440]  A bunch of great members of the DGC and the Irie Army will be there hanging out.
[03:44.440 --> 03:50.080]  Once again I do invite you to join us at the DGC Growers Cup in Fort Collins on July
[03:50.080 --> 03:51.080]  30th.
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.840]  I look forward to shaking your hand, smoking a bowl with you, taking a dab with you, giving
[03:55.840 --> 03:58.160]  a fist bump, taking a selfie with you.
[03:58.160 --> 03:59.520]  It is going to be a great time.
[03:59.520 --> 04:01.120]  I look forward to seeing you.
[04:01.120 --> 04:03.320]  Alright that is enough rambling here at the start of the show.
[04:03.320 --> 04:06.920]  I did say that I had some great emails to read in this episode.
[04:06.920 --> 04:08.320]  Let's jump right into that part.
[04:08.320 --> 04:11.560]  This one comes from a friend who would rather remain anonymous.
[04:11.560 --> 04:13.160]  It goes a little bit like this.
[04:13.160 --> 04:16.560]  It says, Yo Rasta Jeff, yo what's up bro?
[04:16.560 --> 04:22.080]  I'll admit this grow is one of my worst grows in a long time, but with all of your help
[04:22.080 --> 04:27.000]  over the past couple of months, I feel this is my best grow as a cultivator.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.820]  That is a really strong statement.
[04:28.820 --> 04:32.120]  Our friend is admitting that this is one of their worst grows in a long time.
[04:32.120 --> 04:36.920]  The grow is not up to par, it's one of the worst, but they feel it is their best grow
[04:36.920 --> 04:38.280]  as a cultivator.
[04:38.280 --> 04:41.000]  In my mind, I can imagine how that would work.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.320]  Sometimes I've played gigs as a musician where I was like that gig totally sucked,
[04:44.320 --> 04:45.800]  I didn't play worth a shit.
[04:45.800 --> 04:49.480]  But I learned more at that gig where I didn't play well than I did at the gigs when I felt
[04:49.480 --> 04:53.040]  like a rockstar and all the music came out super smoothly.
[04:53.040 --> 04:56.520]  However it should have been, I feel like I learn more at those rough gigs.
[04:56.520 --> 04:58.640]  I feel like I learn more when the job is hard.
[04:58.640 --> 05:01.480]  I've talked about it before, I learn more when I make mistakes.
[05:01.480 --> 05:04.240]  If you do shit right, you just learned that you're doing it right.
[05:04.240 --> 05:07.280]  If you make mistakes, you go, well I gotta reassess and figure some shit out.
[05:07.280 --> 05:10.280]  There are details and steps I'm missing or adding.
[05:10.280 --> 05:11.520]  So you gotta figure that out.
[05:11.520 --> 05:14.840]  So our friend said that this was their worst grow, but they feel like it was their best
[05:14.840 --> 05:16.620]  grow as a cultivator.
[05:16.620 --> 05:22.320]  So they are growing inside as a person, mentally, physically, spiritually, and as a grower.
[05:22.320 --> 05:26.320]  They're becoming a better grower, even though they did have a bad run just now.
[05:26.320 --> 05:28.840]  It says my plants are fucked, but I am growing.
[05:28.840 --> 05:30.900]  And that's important.
[05:30.900 --> 05:34.640]  You're still growing, you're going to continue to grow, your life will continue.
[05:34.640 --> 05:37.480]  Your mind will grow, your body will age, life will go on.
[05:37.480 --> 05:38.560]  And guess what?
[05:38.560 --> 05:40.640]  You get to grow more plants.
[05:40.640 --> 05:45.200]  I'm sure you learned something that you should not do again in this last run, and I'm sure
[05:45.200 --> 05:47.920]  you learned something you should try again in the last run.
[05:47.920 --> 05:53.480]  So as long as you are growing with every grow, it's okay to have some mistakes, to totally
[05:53.480 --> 05:54.480]  ruin a crop.
[05:54.480 --> 05:57.760]  That's okay occasionally, just don't do it too many times.
[05:57.760 --> 05:58.760]  Learn from it.
[05:58.760 --> 05:59.960]  Make sure you learn from it.
[05:59.960 --> 06:03.800]  So our friend is growing as a person, and that is what matters the most.
[06:03.800 --> 06:08.120]  It says, I feel like you, and he's saying me, it says, Rasta Jeff, I feel like you spent
[06:08.120 --> 06:12.200]  as much work on my grow as I did this run.
[06:12.200 --> 06:13.200]  That is awesome, bro.
[06:13.200 --> 06:15.680]  I don't, I can't take any credit for your grow.
[06:15.680 --> 06:20.400]  I put out a podcast, I did correspond with you through emails, but you did all the work,
[06:20.400 --> 06:21.400]  my dude.
[06:21.400 --> 06:24.360]  You're in there turning the knobs, picking the leaves, watering the plants, doing the
[06:24.360 --> 06:25.840]  things, you're doing that.
[06:25.840 --> 06:30.440]  So I appreciate that you feel like I did a lot of work, but I've done the work.
[06:30.440 --> 06:34.200]  I'm doing the work in my grow, and then talking to you about what I do, and it just so happens
[06:34.200 --> 06:35.760]  that it works.
[06:35.760 --> 06:37.080]  Give yourself a lot of credit.
[06:37.080 --> 06:41.800]  You're realizing that your grow is not what you want it to be, but you're realizing that
[06:41.800 --> 06:42.800]  you are learning from it.
[06:42.800 --> 06:45.400]  And that, as a person, that is a big growth step.
[06:45.400 --> 06:47.760]  So don't give me too much credit for the grow.
[06:47.760 --> 06:49.880]  It says, I just wanted to say thank you.
[06:49.880 --> 06:54.640]  You probably saved me from quitting growing or having a breakdown or joining a cult.
[06:54.640 --> 06:56.440]  I really think that's a funny message.
[06:56.440 --> 06:58.560]  I do appreciate it.
[06:58.680 --> 07:02.240]  I get a lot of messages from people who tell me how much I help their garden, how much
[07:02.240 --> 07:07.960]  we improve their process, improve their yield, potency, flavor, aroma, enjoyment.
[07:07.960 --> 07:13.280]  But to hear that our friend has had a terrible crop experience, but is having a good learning
[07:13.280 --> 07:19.160]  and a good spiritual, mental, emotional building experience, they're growing, to learn that
[07:19.160 --> 07:22.680]  I'm guiding somebody, even though they're having one of the worst grows ever.
[07:22.680 --> 07:26.160]  This grows one of my worst, yeah, in a long time, but they're still feeling like they're
[07:26.160 --> 07:27.160]  making growth.
[07:27.560 --> 07:31.280]  And a lot of it is because I'm spending time teaching them.
[07:31.280 --> 07:32.280]  That is awesome.
[07:32.280 --> 07:33.680]  That recharges me.
[07:33.680 --> 07:37.600]  That is like giving me some fresh nutrients, giving me a dose of recharge.
[07:37.600 --> 07:39.600]  So dude, you asked to remain anonymous.
[07:39.600 --> 07:40.920]  I will honor that wish.
[07:40.920 --> 07:42.120]  But bro, thank you.
[07:42.120 --> 07:43.920]  Big fist bump for the words of encouragement.
[07:43.920 --> 07:45.240]  I do appreciate that.
[07:45.240 --> 07:46.800]  All right, we don't need to ramble too much.
[07:46.800 --> 07:49.340]  I've got another message here in front of me.
[07:49.340 --> 07:53.780]  This one, it does not have their name on it, so we will not include that.
[07:53.780 --> 07:56.920]  But it says, okay, my dude, that's how it starts.
[07:57.680 --> 08:01.240]  And this one, if you've got kids in the room, cover their ears now, because I'm going to
[08:01.240 --> 08:02.280]  say some crass shit.
[08:02.280 --> 08:04.080]  This is kind of a fun email.
[08:04.080 --> 08:05.920]  That's why I included it here in the Thursday show.
[08:05.920 --> 08:07.240]  Is this a Monday or a Thursday show?
[08:07.240 --> 08:09.120]  This will be a Thursday show.
[08:09.120 --> 08:12.460]  So if you've got kids in the room, maybe cover up their ears right now or turn it down or
[08:12.460 --> 08:16.040]  put your AirPods in, because this one's going to be fun, but there will be some foul language.
[08:16.040 --> 08:20.600]  The question is, if you had to, and this is a game that maybe it's not the best game.
[08:20.600 --> 08:24.080]  It's definitely not a socially or politically correct game, but I'm sure we're all aware
[08:24.080 --> 08:25.080]  of the game.
[08:25.080 --> 08:26.160]  Fuck, marry, kill.
[08:26.400 --> 08:28.840]  We're going to do a quick round of fuck, marry, kill here on the podcast.
[08:28.840 --> 08:33.480]  It goes, if you had to either fuck, marry, kill one of these girls, who would it be?
[08:33.480 --> 08:37.840]  And this is the only way that this works out to be appropriate because he has chosen strains.
[08:37.840 --> 08:41.720]  We are choosing plants, not people, which is the only reason I chose to read this one.
[08:41.720 --> 08:43.280]  If it were people, we would have thrown this away.
[08:43.280 --> 08:46.200]  We're not going to play that, but it goes a lot like this.
[08:46.200 --> 08:47.200]  Fuck, marry, kill.
[08:47.200 --> 08:51.880]  My three options are the moon tower, prana, and morning dew, which means I got to choose
[08:51.880 --> 08:55.040]  one to fuck, one to marry, one to kill.
[08:56.040 --> 08:59.240]  Right off the top of my head, we're killing prana.
[08:59.240 --> 09:00.960]  Let me explain why.
[09:00.960 --> 09:02.520]  There's nothing wrong with prana.
[09:02.520 --> 09:03.840]  There's nothing wrong with flow.
[09:03.840 --> 09:08.160]  There's nothing wrong with the rise, the plants that do make this cross of prana.
[09:08.160 --> 09:14.400]  The reason I'm killing prana right off the bat is because I ran a dispensary in 2008.
[09:14.400 --> 09:18.960]  Mike and I, big up to my buddy, White Mike, and shout out to Tom also, and Chrisanne,
[09:18.960 --> 09:20.960]  and Tree, the people from that dispensary.
[09:20.960 --> 09:21.960]  Miss you guys.
[09:21.960 --> 09:27.720]  We ran a dispensary in 2008, and we grew a mountain of flow.
[09:27.720 --> 09:29.480]  We had truckloads of flow.
[09:29.480 --> 09:31.000]  I don't even know how much there was.
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.200]  I didn't care.
[09:32.200 --> 09:33.560]  There was a lot of it.
[09:33.560 --> 09:34.560]  We were growing it.
[09:34.560 --> 09:35.560]  We were smoking it.
[09:35.560 --> 09:36.560]  We were selling it.
[09:36.560 --> 09:37.560]  We were turning it into edibles.
[09:37.560 --> 09:39.360]  We were turning it into concentrates.
[09:39.360 --> 09:42.160]  We were doing anything you could possibly do with a weed plant.
[09:42.160 --> 09:44.840]  We were making it out of flow.
[09:44.840 --> 09:45.840]  Flow was a great plant.
[09:45.840 --> 09:47.400]  Flow was the parent of prana.
[09:47.400 --> 09:49.360]  When I smell prana, I smell flow.
[09:49.360 --> 09:51.280]  Let me explain why I'm so sick of it.
[09:51.320 --> 09:53.320]  I had a lot of it in my home.
[09:53.320 --> 09:58.000]  I had a lot of it in my retail sales place, my dispensary.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.400]  I had a lot of it in my commercial grow.
[10:00.400 --> 10:02.960]  I could not get away from flow.
[10:02.960 --> 10:05.840]  Everywhere I went, it smelled like flow.
[10:05.840 --> 10:07.600]  The plant grew beautifully.
[10:07.600 --> 10:09.120]  The plant grew perfectly.
[10:09.120 --> 10:10.680]  You couldn't ask for anything more.
[10:10.680 --> 10:11.680]  It was robust.
[10:11.680 --> 10:12.680]  It took a beating.
[10:12.680 --> 10:13.680]  It took abuse.
[10:13.680 --> 10:14.880]  It took temperature swings.
[10:14.880 --> 10:15.880]  It took bad VPD.
[10:15.880 --> 10:17.680]  It could handle anything you could handle.
[10:17.680 --> 10:18.920]  It would throw at it.
[10:18.920 --> 10:19.920]  It could handle bugs.
[10:19.920 --> 10:21.360]  Spidermites didn't like it.
[10:21.360 --> 10:23.040]  I put out good fat harvest.
[10:23.040 --> 10:24.320]  It would finish early.
[10:24.320 --> 10:27.400]  It would be done before everybody else, especially outdoors.
[10:27.400 --> 10:29.000]  The herb tasted real good.
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.280]  The buzz was real nice.
[10:30.280 --> 10:33.200]  The aroma was great until it wasn't.
[10:33.200 --> 10:37.840]  One day I woke up and I was like, all I can fucking smell is flow right now.
[10:37.840 --> 10:43.240]  I don't want to smell flow right now, but I had allegedly a lot of flow weed.
[10:43.240 --> 10:44.520]  We won't even talk about how much I had.
[10:44.520 --> 10:45.520]  I had a lot of it.
[10:45.520 --> 10:49.040]  I was like, I can't just get rid ... I mean, I could sell it, but I got to sell it.
[10:49.160 --> 10:50.240]  It's not going anywhere for a minute.
[10:50.240 --> 10:53.640]  It's got to sit here for a day or two until I could drive it to where it needs to be.
[10:53.640 --> 10:56.680]  So the weed is just stinking up my house and all I can smell is flow.
[10:56.680 --> 10:58.040]  I take a shower.
[10:58.040 --> 10:59.400]  I put on clean clothes.
[10:59.400 --> 11:00.960]  In the car, guess what I smell?
[11:00.960 --> 11:01.960]  More flow.
[11:01.960 --> 11:05.760]  I get to work at the dispensary where I work and guess what we're selling all day?
[11:05.760 --> 11:06.760]  More flow.
[11:06.760 --> 11:09.800]  I get off work from working in the dispensary and now I've got to go into the grow and take
[11:09.800 --> 11:12.340]  care of the plants and guess what it smells like in there?
[11:12.340 --> 11:13.340]  More flow.
[11:13.340 --> 11:16.920]  So I was done with flow and flow makes up prana.
[11:16.920 --> 11:20.440]  After I made prana, I put out a bunch of the seeds and I made sure that they were awesome
[11:20.440 --> 11:21.440]  and then guess what I did?
[11:21.440 --> 11:22.760]  I chopped down that flow plant.
[11:22.760 --> 11:24.280]  I'm never going to grow flow again.
[11:24.280 --> 11:25.280]  I don't want to smell it.
[11:25.280 --> 11:26.880]  I don't want to smoke it.
[11:26.880 --> 11:28.000]  There's nothing wrong with it.
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.800]  I'm just fucking done with it, dude.
[11:29.800 --> 11:31.280]  I've smelled it so much.
[11:31.280 --> 11:36.400]  I woke up next to it, went to bed next to it, went to work with it, came home to it.
[11:36.400 --> 11:37.600]  That's enough for me, dude.
[11:37.600 --> 11:42.880]  So the first one off this, the fuck, marry, kill sheet here that I'm just going to straight
[11:42.880 --> 11:44.120]  up kill is going to be prana.
[11:44.120 --> 11:45.640]  I'm going to say it again.
[11:45.640 --> 11:49.920]  Prana is a great strain, but I'm so sick of flow and we got to kill one that makes it
[11:49.920 --> 11:50.920]  easy.
[11:50.920 --> 11:51.920]  Now that gives me two options here.
[11:51.920 --> 11:54.160]  We got the moon tower and morning dew.
[11:54.160 --> 11:56.400]  We got to fuck one and marry the other.
[11:56.400 --> 11:59.320]  All right, I've made a decision.
[11:59.320 --> 12:02.800]  We're going to, and I got to quit saying fuck so many times in this podcast, we're going
[12:02.800 --> 12:07.360]  to get taken down or something by the YouTube here, but I'm going to choose the moon tower
[12:07.360 --> 12:09.040]  for my fucking why?
[12:09.040 --> 12:11.360]  Because it's brand new and shiny and it's brand new.
[12:11.360 --> 12:13.280]  Everybody likes that brand new one that just showed up.
[12:13.280 --> 12:14.280]  That's going to be fun.
[12:14.280 --> 12:16.840]  So we're going to, we're going to bone down on the brand new one.
[12:16.840 --> 12:18.200]  Then we're going to marry morning dew.
[12:18.200 --> 12:20.480]  Why do I pick morning dew for marriage?
[12:20.480 --> 12:24.560]  Because that is a cross of a couple of my favorite strains that have really done a lot
[12:24.560 --> 12:25.560]  for me.
[12:25.560 --> 12:28.040]  Grateful dog is kind of what got me noticed.
[12:28.040 --> 12:30.520]  Morning dew is what definitely made sure we were noticed.
[12:30.520 --> 12:32.100]  I bred them together.
[12:32.100 --> 12:36.560]  Those are two of my, my heaters, my bangers, my top sellers, the most popular strains I've
[12:36.560 --> 12:38.260]  ever made put together.
[12:38.260 --> 12:39.820]  Why wouldn't I marry that one?
[12:39.820 --> 12:41.960]  So a fuck, marry, kill.
[12:41.960 --> 12:47.120]  We're going to fuck the moon tower, marry morning dew and kill the Prana.
[12:47.120 --> 12:52.200]  I really hope you enjoyed that question and the answer, and I hope you enjoy and appreciate
[12:52.200 --> 12:53.200]  my answers.
[12:53.200 --> 12:55.280]  Once again, I'm sick of Prana, the moon tower.
[12:55.280 --> 12:56.280]  That's brand new.
[12:56.280 --> 12:58.200]  We're going to have to play with that one in the morning.
[12:58.200 --> 13:00.900]  That's two of my favorites, old trustee put together.
[13:00.900 --> 13:02.040]  We're going to marry that one.
[13:02.040 --> 13:03.680]  All right, my buddy.
[13:03.680 --> 13:05.440]  He started the message with, okay, my dude.
[13:05.440 --> 13:08.160]  So I'm going to end it up with, all right, my dude, thank you for the great question.
[13:08.160 --> 13:11.600]  It says, I hope you're as high as me when you get this email and it finds you.
[13:11.600 --> 13:14.240]  Well, I was pretty lit when I got the message.
[13:14.240 --> 13:17.920]  Not quite as lit now because we were trying to do a podcast.
[13:17.920 --> 13:20.240]  Definitely blazed, but not as high as you.
[13:20.240 --> 13:22.000]  I could tell by some of the questions you ask.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.160]  All right, we're going to keep burning through these emails.
[13:24.160 --> 13:25.840]  I do have a couple more here in front of me.
[13:25.840 --> 13:28.080]  We're not going to make a super long Thursday show.
[13:28.080 --> 13:30.320]  I'm sure you could tell that my voice is a little bit dry.
[13:30.320 --> 13:34.240]  I think it was, I was outdoors doing some outdoor things and I was talking quite loud
[13:34.240 --> 13:38.480]  and I feel like I may have done a little bit of work on the throat here, on the voice here.
[13:38.480 --> 13:41.360]  Not sounding like the radio DJ I'm used to.
[13:41.360 --> 13:42.400]  We're going to quit rambling.
[13:42.400 --> 13:44.320]  We are going to read more messages.
[13:44.320 --> 13:46.960]  This one does come from my buddy, JH.
[13:46.960 --> 13:49.200]  What's up, JH, you bad motherfucker.
[13:49.200 --> 13:54.240]  JH, I do troll you and pick on you because you send me more emails than anybody else
[13:54.240 --> 13:55.120]  has ever sent me.
[13:55.120 --> 13:57.280]  It's kind of like we're dating at this point.
[13:57.280 --> 13:58.720]  You're a funny fucking dude.
[13:58.720 --> 14:00.000]  You got a great personality.
[14:00.720 --> 14:02.160]  Keep sending the messages.
[14:02.160 --> 14:04.160]  I'm always going to troll you and pick on you.
[14:04.160 --> 14:05.680]  That means that we're friends.
[14:05.680 --> 14:07.440]  JH, this message goes a lot like this.
[14:07.440 --> 14:11.360]  It says, Rasta Jeff, in the episode about Moon Tower, you mentioned that if you leave
[14:11.360 --> 14:14.640]  some phenotypes in too small of a pot, they may stretch.
[14:14.640 --> 14:16.800]  Can you please elaborate on that statement?
[14:17.440 --> 14:21.840]  And then it says, is the goal to choose a pot that will allow for daily waterings and
[14:21.840 --> 14:23.920]  dry backs in mid bloom?
[14:23.920 --> 14:25.920]  So that is a really good question.
[14:25.920 --> 14:30.480]  I did mention in the Moon Tower episode that some phenotypes will, what do they do?
[14:30.480 --> 14:34.000]  They get, they stretch if you leave them in too small of a pot.
[14:34.560 --> 14:35.840]  This is not just the Moon Tower.
[14:35.840 --> 14:37.920]  This is cannabis plants in general.
[14:37.920 --> 14:42.320]  This is strain dependent, probably phenotype dependent, plant specific.
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.720]  But cannabis plants, if you leave them in too small of a pot, they do begin to stretch.
[14:46.720 --> 14:52.080]  They also could auto flower on you if they become root bound in that small pot.
[14:52.080 --> 14:53.280]  It'll take a couple of things.
[14:53.280 --> 14:57.520]  If they're too root bound and they don't have anywhere for the roots to go and they're getting
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.280]  a little bit shaded and not getting the light that they want, then they will auto flower.
[15:01.280 --> 15:03.920]  They'll go into flower on you just because they're in survival mode.
[15:03.920 --> 15:06.560]  They're like, hey, my feet can't grow.
[15:06.560 --> 15:08.240]  I'm obviously limited to size.
[15:08.240 --> 15:09.440]  I'm not getting enough light.
[15:10.480 --> 15:12.320]  My only option now is to flower.
[15:12.320 --> 15:16.720]  My whole goal in life as a cannabis plant is to either pollinate or get pollinated.
[15:16.720 --> 15:20.000]  If you got some female plants in there that aren't living up to their best conditions,
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.040]  they're just going to say, fuck it.
[15:21.040 --> 15:22.160]  I'm going to go into flower.
[15:22.160 --> 15:23.840]  You're either going to pollinate me or you're not.
[15:23.840 --> 15:24.640]  And I'm getting out of here.
[15:24.640 --> 15:25.360]  This life sucks.
[15:25.360 --> 15:25.920]  I'm ending it.
[15:25.920 --> 15:27.600]  I'm not, my feet are stuck.
[15:27.600 --> 15:28.560]  I'm not getting enough light.
[15:28.560 --> 15:29.920]  I'm not getting enough air.
[15:29.920 --> 15:30.800]  My toes are cramped.
[15:30.800 --> 15:31.840]  I can't stretch out.
[15:31.840 --> 15:32.320]  Fuck this.
[15:32.320 --> 15:32.800]  I'm done.
[15:32.800 --> 15:34.640]  And the plant decides to go into flower.
[15:34.640 --> 15:37.760]  So some plants will stretch if you leave them in too small of a pot.
[15:37.760 --> 15:41.280]  Some will flower if you leave them in too small of a pot for too long.
[15:41.280 --> 15:44.400]  The reason I said stretch in that episode is because I was thinking about them in too
[15:44.400 --> 15:46.480]  small of a pot pressed together.
[15:46.480 --> 15:50.480]  And the light is not penetrating the canopy to get down to those lower branches, the lower
[15:50.480 --> 15:53.120]  leaves, and all the plants are crushed together.
[15:53.120 --> 15:54.240]  So they just started stretching.
[15:54.240 --> 15:57.680]  They know there's light up there, but they can't get it down here because it's so crowded.
[15:57.680 --> 16:00.880]  So they just start going up, hoping that they can fight for some of that light.
[16:00.880 --> 16:02.560]  Our plants naturally want to grow up.
[16:02.560 --> 16:03.840]  They're apical dominant plants.
[16:03.840 --> 16:06.960]  They'll get one main top and the branching will try to reach up to that and keep up.
[16:06.960 --> 16:09.280]  That's why we top them, take out that main top.
[16:09.280 --> 16:10.960]  The others have the opportunity to compete.
[16:10.960 --> 16:12.480]  They don't, they know the top is gone.
[16:12.480 --> 16:14.000]  They all want to be the new king.
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.240]  So if we leave them too close together, too crowded in, in too small of a pot, that gives
[16:18.240 --> 16:20.320]  them a really good opportunity to start stretching.
[16:20.320 --> 16:22.000]  They're not getting the light that they could get.
[16:22.000 --> 16:23.360]  They're not going to branch out.
[16:23.360 --> 16:26.960]  Do you look at people's gardens and you see super tall, skinny plants that the branches
[16:26.960 --> 16:29.360]  went just out a little bit and then straight up.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.600]  A lot of that is because the plants were either pushed way too close together.
[16:34.240 --> 16:38.720]  They were in too small of a pot or they just were not getting enough light overall.
[16:38.720 --> 16:42.640]  If you do see those small pots and they're really branchy, stretching up real tall, that
[16:42.640 --> 16:47.440]  should have been flowered sooner or put into a larger pot, in my opinion.
[16:47.440 --> 16:51.840]  So they stretch because they're in too small of a pot because they're getting root bound.
[16:51.840 --> 16:53.280]  They're trying to get up to the light.
[16:53.280 --> 16:54.400]  They're too crowded.
[16:54.400 --> 16:58.720]  When they're too crowded, the number one source of everything for our plants is light.
[16:58.720 --> 16:59.600]  They want that light.
[16:59.600 --> 17:03.120]  If you put the light over there and put the plant over here, you'll notice over time that
[17:03.120 --> 17:04.000]  plant leans that way.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.840]  And then halfway through the day, if you just move the light over there, way over there,
[17:07.840 --> 17:09.840]  that plant will start leaning toward that.
[17:09.840 --> 17:10.880]  They grow toward the light.
[17:10.880 --> 17:12.640]  That's naturally what they want to do.
[17:12.640 --> 17:13.760]  So they're going to stretch.
[17:13.760 --> 17:16.240]  They're going to do their best to get to the light.
[17:16.240 --> 17:19.040]  If you want to grow a vertical wall, then do put the light over there.
[17:19.040 --> 17:21.760]  Then the plants will grow that way and up at the same time.
[17:21.760 --> 17:23.040]  That's not what we're doing here.
[17:23.040 --> 17:24.800]  That's not what we're talking about.
[17:24.800 --> 17:26.800]  Dude, thank you for the great question.
[17:26.800 --> 17:28.400]  If you've got any follow, there is more to this.
[17:28.400 --> 17:30.800]  I was going to say, if you've got follow-ups or more, let me know.
[17:30.800 --> 17:33.520]  But there is already follow-ups and more that I did almost skip.
[17:33.520 --> 17:34.800]  And I apologize for that.
[17:34.800 --> 17:39.840]  It says, is the goal to choose a pot that will allow for daily waterings and drybacks
[17:39.840 --> 17:40.880]  in mid bloom?
[17:42.400 --> 17:47.200]  That is not always the goal, but that is a good, not a goal, but a good thing to have.
[17:47.200 --> 17:52.400]  Honestly, in my personal grow, some of the larger pots don't get watered every single
[17:52.400 --> 17:54.000]  day, but that's a personal grow.
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.600]  And I like to be able to flood them and leave for the weekend and come back and the plants
[17:57.600 --> 17:58.560]  aren't dead.
[17:58.560 --> 18:04.400]  In a commercial grow, I definitely want to water every morning and I want them dry by
[18:04.400 --> 18:05.760]  the time I get back in the morning.
[18:05.760 --> 18:07.200]  If not, by the time I leave.
[18:07.200 --> 18:11.840]  A lot of times in a commercial grow, week six, seven, eight, nine in flower, we will
[18:11.840 --> 18:15.440]  water right when we get there at seven or eight in the morning and then water again
[18:15.440 --> 18:17.280]  at six or seven before we leave.
[18:17.280 --> 18:20.400]  That way we know they're not going to be crunchy again when we get there at seven,
[18:20.400 --> 18:22.160]  six, eight, seven in the morning again.
[18:22.160 --> 18:25.600]  When we show up, because a lot of those big plants, we're running three gallon pots,
[18:25.600 --> 18:30.000]  but we're also pulling 2000 to 3000 gram wet plants.
[18:30.000 --> 18:30.640]  They're wet.
[18:30.640 --> 18:32.320]  Don't start judging, talking shit.
[18:32.320 --> 18:33.040]  They're wet.
[18:33.040 --> 18:36.720]  But imagine how much a 3000 gram wet plant weighs.
[18:36.720 --> 18:38.800]  Those are, there are four or five feet tall.
[18:38.800 --> 18:40.080]  They're huge bushy plants.
[18:40.080 --> 18:43.120]  They drink up a lot of water and they're only in a three gallon pot.
[18:43.120 --> 18:45.280]  So we're watering those once or twice a day.
[18:46.320 --> 18:49.200]  In my personal grow, I'm using soilless mix.
[18:49.200 --> 18:52.000]  It's basically a soilless mix with a bunch of perlite.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.680]  I want to keep that one kind of wet for a longer time than I do the commercial grow.
[18:55.680 --> 19:00.480]  Like I said, I like to, I'll use a bigger pot than I need to, and I'll flood that fucker.
[19:00.480 --> 19:01.280]  I like to leave town.
[19:01.280 --> 19:04.800]  I go, I like to do a lot of stuff on the weekends and I don't want to interrupt my weekend.
[19:04.800 --> 19:07.360]  So I like to give them a big fat watering on Friday.
[19:07.360 --> 19:09.200]  Then I'll just take a peek at them over the weekend.
[19:09.200 --> 19:11.760]  And I can tell if they're cool, if they need anything, you can look at them through the
[19:11.760 --> 19:13.120]  camera, see what's going on.
[19:13.120 --> 19:15.840]  But I know that Monday they're going to make it until Monday.
[19:15.840 --> 19:18.560]  Then they'll need some water first thing Monday morning.
[19:18.560 --> 19:20.960]  So I use the bigger pots using soilless mix.
[19:20.960 --> 19:25.200]  Of course, in cocoa, I do want that more rapid wet and dry time.
[19:25.200 --> 19:29.680]  So that's another really good example of some of the differences that I use in a commercial
[19:29.680 --> 19:32.880]  grow and a private grow, a big grow, a small grow.
[19:32.880 --> 19:37.520]  And the bigger grow, I'm definitely using cocoa, three gallon pots, auto watering system,
[19:37.520 --> 19:41.600]  and a small personal grow, depending on where it is or whose it is or who's managing it.
[19:41.600 --> 19:44.640]  Probably three, five or seven gallon pots.
[19:44.640 --> 19:46.960]  Generally it's threes and fives, depending on what I'm doing.
[19:46.960 --> 19:48.720]  Sometimes we'll put some sevens in there.
[19:48.720 --> 19:52.560]  If we're really limited on plant counts, we'll just put seven gallon pots and make the plants
[19:52.560 --> 19:53.520]  much larger.
[19:53.520 --> 20:00.640]  But generally I'm using soilless mix and I'm going, I water on Friday and then I can water
[20:00.640 --> 20:01.440]  again on Monday.
[20:01.440 --> 20:05.760]  And then I'll need one more watering midweek, usually with the soilless mix.
[20:05.760 --> 20:06.480]  All right, there we go.
[20:06.480 --> 20:08.320]  I feel like we've wrapped up that question.
[20:08.320 --> 20:09.840]  Thank you so much for the great email.
[20:09.840 --> 20:13.840]  Once again, if you do have any updates, questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, I would
[20:13.840 --> 20:16.560]  love to hear the info, the feedback, the email address.
[20:16.720 --> 20:19.440]  Of course is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[20:19.440 --> 20:23.600]  Don't be shy, reach out, send me your grow questions, send me your constructive criticism,
[20:23.600 --> 20:27.840]  your positive feedback, or let me know if you completely hate something that I did on
[20:27.840 --> 20:28.400]  the show.
[20:28.400 --> 20:31.200]  I'll do my best to make improvements and adjustments.
[20:31.200 --> 20:34.000]  All right, I do have another message right here in front of me.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.520]  This is a good one.
[20:35.520 --> 20:38.960]  It says, is this an old myth or real in your opinion?
[20:38.960 --> 20:42.560]  That is a great way to start a question on a cannabis podcast.
[20:42.560 --> 20:46.320]  It says, when drying cannabis still on the branches hanging.
[20:46.480 --> 20:50.960]  It sounds like we have chopped down the plant, but all of the herb is still on the bush and
[20:50.960 --> 20:52.320]  it's just hanging upside down.
[20:52.320 --> 20:55.200]  So you just got to cut down plant hanging upside down.
[20:55.200 --> 21:00.400]  I wait until I can snap the stems, then I cut each branch into small enough pieces so
[21:00.400 --> 21:05.040]  they can be placed in Tupperware in an attempt to extend the drying period.
[21:05.040 --> 21:06.000]  Okay, this makes sense.
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.560]  So far, you hang them until the stems pop, then you cut them into smaller sections, put
[21:10.560 --> 21:14.400]  them in a Tupperware container in an attempt to extend the drying period.
[21:14.400 --> 21:19.120]  Opening and closing the Tupperware as needed to control the final drying, then trim everything.
[21:19.120 --> 21:24.640]  It says, is this one of those things I read 15 years ago and have been doing for nothing,
[21:24.640 --> 21:26.800]  or is this possibly viable?
[21:26.800 --> 21:28.880]  Bro, this is a really good question.
[21:28.880 --> 21:33.360]  And this is basically what I do in a commercial grow environment.
[21:33.360 --> 21:37.920]  Imagine if we cut down a room full of 3000 gram plants, they're wet.
[21:37.920 --> 21:40.160]  I want to say that again, 3000 grams wet.
[21:40.160 --> 21:42.880]  We're not pulling down 3000 gram dried plants.
[21:42.880 --> 21:44.160]  That would be fucking cool.
[21:44.160 --> 21:45.440]  But we're not doing it.
[21:45.440 --> 21:46.720]  They're wet plants.
[21:46.720 --> 21:48.400]  So we're pulling down somewhere.
[21:48.400 --> 21:51.600]  It depends on what room we're working in and what facility we're working in.
[21:51.600 --> 21:57.440]  Generally, it would be somewhere between one and 500 three gallon pots with 2000 gram,
[21:57.440 --> 21:59.440]  3000 gram wet plants in there.
[21:59.440 --> 22:00.720]  That is a lot of space.
[22:00.720 --> 22:02.320]  That's a lot of material.
[22:02.320 --> 22:06.880]  There is no way that the trim crew could bang through that in a short, timely manner.
[22:06.880 --> 22:08.640]  That's going to be a week worth of work.
[22:08.640 --> 22:14.160]  There's a lot of shucking, bucking, defoliating, leafing, fanning, fine trimming, fine tuning,
[22:14.160 --> 22:17.600]  a lot of shit to be done to process all of that cannabis.
[22:17.600 --> 22:22.000]  So we do a very, very similar process to what you've got going on here.
[22:22.800 --> 22:24.640]  Right before harvest, we will go in the room.
[22:24.640 --> 22:27.840]  The day before harvest, we spend the full day defoliating.
[22:27.840 --> 22:30.560]  Just pull off all those leaves and throw them right into the floor.
[22:30.560 --> 22:32.720]  Just chop, chop, chop, chop, chop as fast as you can.
[22:32.720 --> 22:33.680]  I don't know why I said chop.
[22:33.680 --> 22:35.840]  There's no fingers, I guess it's, or there's no scissors.
[22:35.840 --> 22:36.880]  It's all fingers.
[22:36.880 --> 22:39.840]  It's pluck, pluck, pluck, pluck, pluck, pull, pull, pull as fast as you can.
[22:39.840 --> 22:43.520]  Get every leaf with a petiole, anything you can pull off, take it off of there because
[22:43.520 --> 22:44.960]  we're going to cut down the plants tomorrow.
[22:44.960 --> 22:46.160]  We want them naked.
[22:46.160 --> 22:47.440]  So we cut off all the leaves.
[22:47.440 --> 22:48.320]  Now the plants are naked.
[22:48.320 --> 22:49.520]  They had their haircut.
[22:49.520 --> 22:52.160]  Tomorrow we come in and we chop down every plant.
[22:52.160 --> 22:55.760]  We hang it upside down and we put it in the drying room.
[22:55.760 --> 22:59.440]  In that drying room, I've got a humidifier and a dehumidifier.
[22:59.440 --> 23:04.960]  Depending on the size of the room, maybe I've got multiple dehuey and humidifiers battling
[23:04.960 --> 23:05.440]  each other.
[23:05.440 --> 23:08.480]  I put them both on 50% humidity.
[23:08.480 --> 23:13.360]  I've got the humidifier cranking out 50% and the dehumidifier sucking to make it 50.
[23:13.360 --> 23:18.720]  It stays 50% relative humidity in that room with those two pieces of gear constantly battling.
[23:18.720 --> 23:20.240]  Keep all your filters clean.
[23:20.240 --> 23:21.360]  Keep everything refreshed.
[23:21.360 --> 23:22.880]  Keep the water in the humidifier.
[23:22.880 --> 23:26.400]  Do not use the dehumidifier water back in the humidifier.
[23:26.400 --> 23:27.040]  That is funky.
[23:27.040 --> 23:27.760]  I don't like that.
[23:27.760 --> 23:28.400]  Don't do that.
[23:28.960 --> 23:30.720]  But keep the machines battling.
[23:30.720 --> 23:32.800]  Also keep a good temperature in that place.
[23:32.800 --> 23:36.240]  It is hard to balance the temperature in a commercial grow environment, especially in
[23:36.240 --> 23:40.560]  Colorado, but try to keep it around 60, 65 degrees in there if you can.
[23:40.560 --> 23:41.440]  70 will be okay.
[23:41.440 --> 23:42.960]  Let's not go too much higher than that.
[23:42.960 --> 23:47.600]  75 is going to work, but let's stay lower if we can.
[23:47.600 --> 23:52.400]  I put all of the plants hanging in that room until, just like you said, the branches begin
[23:52.400 --> 23:53.280]  to snap.
[23:53.280 --> 23:54.880]  Some of the bigger plants will take longer.
[23:54.880 --> 23:56.640]  Some of the smaller plants will be quicker.
[23:56.640 --> 24:00.240]  That's a good thing because I've got so many plants that I don't want them all ready at
[24:00.240 --> 24:00.880]  the same time.
[24:00.880 --> 24:01.840]  It gets overwhelming.
[24:02.160 --> 24:08.320]  So when shit starts popping and crunching, I will start throwing it into large Sterlite
[24:08.320 --> 24:08.720]  bins.
[24:08.720 --> 24:12.000]  It's the same thing you're doing with the Tupperware containers, but I'm using much
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.120]  larger bins.
[24:13.120 --> 24:15.440]  They're approximately, I'm holding my arms out.
[24:15.440 --> 24:16.800]  I think that's about three feet.
[24:16.800 --> 24:18.320]  They're about three feet long.
[24:18.320 --> 24:21.360]  They're about 18 inches deep and about 18 inches wide.
[24:21.360 --> 24:25.360]  And we just cut the plants down, cut them into small pieces, get rid of all the big
[24:25.360 --> 24:26.800]  sticks will get taken out.
[24:26.800 --> 24:30.080]  Let me talk about something while this is in my brain.
[24:30.960 --> 24:36.800]  Sometimes I let the plants get a little bit crispier than seems desirable because when
[24:36.800 --> 24:41.600]  I put them in that big of a plant with all that material, there's a bunch of bud, there's
[24:41.600 --> 24:42.320]  a bunch of stick.
[24:42.320 --> 24:44.240]  There's still a bunch of leaf remaining.
[24:44.240 --> 24:49.200]  When I put all of that into the container and seal it, it really, really reconstitutes
[24:49.200 --> 24:54.400]  more than you may anticipate, more than you may assume, more than you may expect.
[24:54.400 --> 24:57.920]  So maybe let them get a little bit crispier.
[24:57.920 --> 25:02.160]  I may let them get a little bit crispier than some growers may prefer before I put
[25:02.160 --> 25:06.560]  it into that container because I know it's going to remoisten and reconstitute, and it's
[25:06.560 --> 25:08.080]  not going to be as dry as it looks.
[25:08.080 --> 25:09.760]  And we're in a commercial grow.
[25:09.760 --> 25:10.400]  We're going to leave.
[25:10.400 --> 25:11.520]  We're going to go home for the night.
[25:11.520 --> 25:13.200]  We're going to come back in the next morning.
[25:13.200 --> 25:17.120]  I can't have too wet of a product in a container sealed overnight.
[25:17.120 --> 25:22.320]  I would almost rather let it dry just a little bit too much in that room than I would put
[25:22.320 --> 25:24.160]  it in the container a little bit too wet.
[25:24.160 --> 25:26.080]  So that's something I wanted to touch on.
[25:26.080 --> 25:29.840]  I let it dry a little bit too much because I don't want the mold.
[25:29.840 --> 25:33.760]  I'd rather a little bit dry, crispy weed that I can remoisten with the trick I'll talk about
[25:33.760 --> 25:37.760]  in a moment than I would moldy weed that's got to get thrown away and never makes it
[25:37.760 --> 25:38.320]  to the shelf.
[25:38.320 --> 25:41.520]  Now, if my weed does get too dry, what do I do?
[25:41.520 --> 25:42.880]  How do I fix this problem?
[25:42.880 --> 25:43.920]  It's really easy.
[25:43.920 --> 25:49.040]  I go to the grow space and I pull a few leaves off of a growing plant, big fan leaves, and
[25:49.040 --> 25:52.320]  I drop those right in with the dry weed and I seal it back up.
[25:52.320 --> 25:56.560]  Now, the moisture from that leaf will remoisten, reconstitute my dried up weed.
[25:56.560 --> 25:59.280]  It won't give it a funky flavor or aroma because guess what?
[25:59.280 --> 25:59.840]  It's weed.
[25:59.840 --> 26:01.600]  We're using weed to remoisten the weed.
[26:02.160 --> 26:03.280]  I think it works beautifully.
[26:03.280 --> 26:04.400]  So that's one trick that I do.
[26:04.400 --> 26:05.680]  So I'm on the same path as you.
[26:05.680 --> 26:06.720]  We've cut down the plants.
[26:07.760 --> 26:09.440]  We've taken off most of the leaves.
[26:09.440 --> 26:10.960]  We let it get crispy dry.
[26:10.960 --> 26:13.120]  Now we throw it into these bins.
[26:13.120 --> 26:13.920]  You've got the option.
[26:13.920 --> 26:17.520]  Do you want to remove a lot of the big stems or do you want to leave a lot of the big stems
[26:17.520 --> 26:18.080]  at this time?
[26:18.800 --> 26:20.720]  If it's really dry, leave them.
[26:20.720 --> 26:22.720]  They'll help remoisten everything nice and evenly.
[26:22.720 --> 26:23.200]  They'll move.
[26:23.200 --> 26:26.080]  It'll move all the moisture around real evenly to those buds.
[26:26.080 --> 26:27.280]  Some of the bottoms will be more wet.
[26:27.280 --> 26:31.120]  The dries will be drier, of course, but if it was all real dry, it'll move it around
[26:31.120 --> 26:33.280]  to the moisture is more even in that container.
[26:33.280 --> 26:35.600]  So if your sticks are super dry, pull them out.
[26:35.600 --> 26:37.920]  If your sticks are super or if they're super wet, pull them out.
[26:37.920 --> 26:40.000]  If the sticks are dry, put them back in there.
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.840]  But we cut off all the leaves, hang it upside down, let it get crunchy.
[26:43.840 --> 26:47.840]  Once it starts popping and going crack on the stems, we put it into the containers.
[26:47.840 --> 26:49.280]  Then we seal it up.
[26:49.280 --> 26:51.200]  Then we've got a guy used to be Mike's job.
[26:51.200 --> 26:53.280]  Mike would be the leader of the trim crew.
[26:53.280 --> 26:55.840]  Mike and myself would go through after every break.
[26:55.840 --> 26:57.440]  We take a break every two hours.
[26:57.440 --> 27:00.720]  When we come back from the break, I would get the crew going on what they need to do.
[27:00.720 --> 27:05.200]  Then I myself and Mike would go into the dry and cure room and pop open every container.
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.320]  Sometimes we would have hundreds of big 32 quart.
[27:10.320 --> 27:12.160]  I forgot the size like 32 gallon.
[27:12.160 --> 27:14.400]  I totally forgot what how much fits in that shit.
[27:14.400 --> 27:16.480]  We'd have these big containers, hundreds of them.
[27:16.480 --> 27:17.920]  We'd pop them all open.
[27:17.920 --> 27:20.560]  And if they need to be open for 10 minutes, they'd slide over there.
[27:20.560 --> 27:23.360]  If they need to be open for the rest of the day, they slide over there.
[27:23.360 --> 27:25.520]  We inspect every single bin.
[27:25.520 --> 27:29.840]  Then if they need to stay open, we'll just leave them open until tomorrow or we'll close them up.
[27:29.840 --> 27:32.400]  If they're fine, they just get sealed up and they get marked.
[27:32.400 --> 27:33.680]  Don't open anymore.
[27:33.680 --> 27:38.960]  Now those bins can sit basically indefinitely until the trim crew is ready to get to them.
[27:38.960 --> 27:42.560]  If they're dry enough, if there's still moisture in there, that could cause a problem.
[27:42.560 --> 27:44.800]  You do have to pop those as needed.
[27:44.800 --> 27:49.760]  I'd say daily, hourly, quarterly, however you feel is needed for that particular product.
[27:49.760 --> 27:54.720]  But once it gets to that dry state, where it's not going to cause any mold problems,
[27:54.720 --> 27:56.400]  it's basically curing in that bin.
[27:56.960 --> 28:01.760]  It gets dry enough to where all I've got to do is when the trim crew has time or when one of my
[28:01.760 --> 28:06.240]  workers has time or myself even, when it's time, we can just pull that whole bin out,
[28:06.240 --> 28:07.360]  set it on the table.
[28:07.360 --> 28:09.040]  We got a guy that's really good at shucking.
[28:09.040 --> 28:12.000]  He just gets all the sticks out and all the buds will be in a bucket.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.600]  All the sticks will be in the trash.
[28:13.600 --> 28:17.520]  So then all the big buds go to one area, the small buds go to another and those get processed.
[28:17.520 --> 28:19.280]  But that can happen whenever.
[28:19.280 --> 28:24.800]  As long as we keep those buds in that container, in that room where the equipment is fighting at
[28:24.800 --> 28:29.840]  50-50 and the temperature is right, those buds will stay fine basically forever.
[28:29.840 --> 28:32.880]  I'm sure there's some sort of expiration date and they pass their prime.
[28:32.880 --> 28:34.160]  They never lasted that long.
[28:34.160 --> 28:37.120]  We get them dried, cured, trimmed and sold before that.
[28:37.120 --> 28:41.680]  But they basically sit in those containers until the trim crew can get to them, which may be
[28:41.680 --> 28:45.600]  just a few days or it could be several days depending on how many harvests have come and
[28:45.600 --> 28:47.360]  how many bins are in that harvest.
[28:47.360 --> 28:48.480]  One more thing I should mention.
[28:49.520 --> 28:54.080]  When I do the big bins, the big bin, not the clock, the big containers.
[28:54.080 --> 28:58.880]  When I do the bins, I line them with butcher paper before I put the plants in there.
[28:58.880 --> 29:00.480]  So it's the big container.
[29:00.480 --> 29:02.800]  I just have a roll of butcher paper on the wall.
[29:02.800 --> 29:04.240]  I know how much to pull off.
[29:04.240 --> 29:05.280]  I pull that off.
[29:05.280 --> 29:06.960]  I line the bottom of the container.
[29:06.960 --> 29:10.320]  I put the buds in there and then I just gently wrap the paper around it.
[29:10.320 --> 29:11.680]  This does a couple of things.
[29:11.680 --> 29:13.600]  That paper absorbs a lot of moisture.
[29:14.400 --> 29:17.440]  That paper also helps me keep my containers clean.
[29:17.440 --> 29:18.320]  We've got to scrub them.
[29:18.320 --> 29:20.080]  We got to clean them for the next harvest.
[29:20.080 --> 29:21.280]  This is just a little buffer.
[29:21.280 --> 29:24.480]  It helps keep some of the keef and the resin off of the containers.
[29:24.480 --> 29:25.920]  Helps me keep it clean.
[29:25.920 --> 29:27.680]  Also, it does one more thing.
[29:27.680 --> 29:28.880]  I like to flip the buds.
[29:28.880 --> 29:29.680]  I like to flip them.
[29:29.680 --> 29:31.040]  I like to flip the stake.
[29:31.040 --> 29:33.280]  You don't want the bottom buds on the bottom the whole time.
[29:33.280 --> 29:34.560]  They're going to get moist down there.
[29:34.560 --> 29:35.600]  They're not going to get airflow.
[29:35.600 --> 29:37.280]  They're not going to get dry properly.
[29:37.440 --> 29:40.640]  I use that paper to just rotate the whole package of buds.
[29:40.640 --> 29:44.320]  I just flip the whole thing over and that paper kind of contains it a little bit.
[29:44.320 --> 29:46.480]  Make sure the whole package of buds gets flipped.
[29:46.480 --> 29:50.560]  The whole bundle gets rolled over so I can get that moisture that was down at the bottom
[29:50.560 --> 29:51.440]  up to the top.
[29:51.440 --> 29:52.080]  Get it out.
[29:52.080 --> 29:53.120]  Get it moving around.
[29:53.120 --> 29:55.120]  Get those buds properly dried and cured.
[29:55.120 --> 29:59.040]  Once those plants and buds are appropriately dry, you can just pull them off the stick,
[29:59.040 --> 30:01.360]  pass them to the trim crew, and they can trim it up whatever.
[30:01.360 --> 30:04.560]  When it's a little bit drier, I believe it's much easier to trim.
[30:04.560 --> 30:06.800]  You don't have such sticky shit to work with.
[30:06.880 --> 30:08.800]  You don't have everything sticking to your gloves.
[30:08.800 --> 30:12.000]  It should be kind of sticky, but when it's dry, you can just use your thumbs.
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.840]  I don't even use scissors most of the time.
[30:13.840 --> 30:17.520]  I don't have anything good around here that could work as a bud, but if this plant were
[30:17.520 --> 30:21.600]  a bud and I were trimming it, I'd hold it with one hand and just use my thumbs to knock
[30:21.600 --> 30:25.280]  off the leaves and just spin it and work my way up and down it, knocking off the crispy
[30:25.280 --> 30:27.520]  leaves with my thumbs because it should be that dry.
[30:27.520 --> 30:31.680]  So it sounds like you are doing everything basically the way that I would do it in a
[30:31.680 --> 30:32.400]  commercial grow.
[30:32.400 --> 30:36.240]  We cut it down, clean it up, put it in the bins, keep it kind of sustained until it's
[30:36.240 --> 30:37.120]  time to trim it.
[30:37.120 --> 30:38.960]  Then when it's time to trim it, we trim it.
[30:38.960 --> 30:44.880]  Then it goes into more containers that are more airtight and better sealed so that they
[30:44.880 --> 30:46.640]  don't get so crispy from that point.
[30:46.640 --> 30:50.880]  Then they're transferred to the dispensaries, which at that point, I have no control or
[30:50.880 --> 30:53.040]  no say or no idea what happens to it at that point.
[30:53.040 --> 30:57.840]  We do our best in the commercial grow to keep the buds, the plants, the flowers, the products
[30:57.840 --> 30:58.560]  top shelf.
[30:58.560 --> 31:00.560]  The grower has a lot of pride in it.
[31:00.560 --> 31:01.840]  We put a lot of work into it.
[31:01.840 --> 31:05.280]  I want you to get the best flowers, but I can't promise that it's going to be kept
[31:05.280 --> 31:06.880]  fresh at the dispensaries.
[31:06.880 --> 31:10.320]  I wish I had more control over what happens there, but that's a whole nother topic for
[31:10.320 --> 31:13.200]  a whole nother podcast at a whole nother time.
[31:13.200 --> 31:15.200]  Um, let's see, where do we go?
[31:15.200 --> 31:19.200]  This was not one of the things you read 15 years ago that you've been doing for nothing.
[31:19.200 --> 31:23.680]  I believe that you were doing it basically the way that I do it in a commercial grow,
[31:23.680 --> 31:25.600]  which in my opinion is great.
[31:25.600 --> 31:27.200]  So you've been doing the right way.
[31:27.200 --> 31:28.400]  Keep doing it that way.
[31:28.400 --> 31:30.480]  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[31:30.480 --> 31:33.440]  But once again, do always analyze your process.
[31:33.440 --> 31:35.840]  Make sure you're not doing anything unnecessary.
[31:36.480 --> 31:40.800]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[31:40.800 --> 31:44.880]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you amazing cannabis enthusiasts out there.
