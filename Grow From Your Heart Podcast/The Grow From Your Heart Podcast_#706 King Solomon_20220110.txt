[00:23.650 --> 00:28.570]  This is episode 706 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:28.570 --> 00:33.770]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about King Solomon and how I select male plants for breeding.
[00:33.770 --> 00:37.370]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great

[01:16.150 --> 01:19.850]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:19.850 --> 01:26.370]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:26.370 --> 01:29.210]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:29.210 --> 01:33.730]  And you know I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:33.730 --> 01:36.690]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:36.690 --> 01:37.690]  All right.
[01:37.690 --> 01:40.530]  I don't want to ramble too much here at the start of the show.
[01:40.530 --> 01:43.330]  Let's jump into the main topic of this episode.
[01:43.330 --> 01:46.930]  We're going to talk about King Solomon and selecting male plants.
[01:46.930 --> 01:52.750]  I got a message from our friend Darcy and it goes a little bit like this.
[01:52.750 --> 01:56.930]  It says, hey Rasta Jeff, let me start with how much I love your work.
[01:56.930 --> 02:03.090]  The podcast has kept me company for years and I have learned a lot from you.
[02:03.090 --> 02:04.090]  That is a great compliment.
[02:04.090 --> 02:08.430]  I love knowing that people are learning from me and I love knowing that the podcast keeps
[02:08.430 --> 02:09.430]  you company.
[02:09.430 --> 02:11.290]  I listen to a lot of podcasts myself.
[02:11.290 --> 02:15.250]  I listen when I'm driving, when I'm working, when I just need some entertainment.
[02:15.250 --> 02:17.610]  And it is like hanging out with some of your best friends.
[02:17.610 --> 02:20.410]  You get to pick and choose who you listen to.
[02:20.410 --> 02:24.130]  Sometimes it's better than having your friends around because you can just press pause, mute,
[02:24.130 --> 02:25.490]  next, skip.
[02:25.490 --> 02:28.050]  Whatever you want, you can hear good entertaining shit.
[02:28.050 --> 02:31.350]  So I'm glad and I'm excited and grateful that you were choosing me.
[02:31.350 --> 02:34.890]  Thank you for choosing me to be in your ear, rambling at you all day.
[02:34.890 --> 02:36.690]  I do appreciate that.
[02:36.690 --> 02:38.450]  And also I'm glad you're learning from me.
[02:38.450 --> 02:39.650]  That is the goal here.
[02:39.650 --> 02:42.730]  Let me keep going because I can get rambly quite quickly.
[02:42.730 --> 02:46.390]  It says, I am also a huge fan of your breeding work.
[02:46.390 --> 02:47.390]  Thank you.
[02:47.390 --> 02:51.410]  It says, I was also lucky enough to score some lemon Jeffrey a while back and they were
[02:51.410 --> 02:57.530]  beautiful plants that grew the most amazing daytime weed, super energetic, social, and
[02:57.530 --> 02:58.970]  she was a beauty.
[02:58.970 --> 03:00.010]  That's a great compliment.
[03:00.010 --> 03:01.010]  Thank you.
[03:01.010 --> 03:02.010]  It goes on.
[03:02.010 --> 03:05.290]  It says, I now want to start making some seeds of my own.
[03:05.290 --> 03:07.610]  Yeah, that is the natural progression.
[03:07.610 --> 03:10.650]  A lot of people start growing, they get good at growing.
[03:10.650 --> 03:13.590]  Then they realize I want to breed and see what I can create.
[03:13.590 --> 03:15.470]  That is a very natural progression.
[03:15.470 --> 03:18.490]  That's kind of how we ended up where I am today.
[03:18.490 --> 03:24.090]  It says, after years of hearing you speak about King Solomon, I thought your genetics
[03:24.090 --> 03:26.090]  might be a good place to start.
[03:26.090 --> 03:31.330]  I could not get any arise seeds in my area, but I was able to score some dark hollow.
[03:31.330 --> 03:32.770]  That will still be great.
[03:32.770 --> 03:34.290]  That'll be a great project.
[03:34.290 --> 03:37.970]  So many people are breeding with the rise that you will set yourself apart by breeding
[03:37.970 --> 03:38.970]  with the dark hollow.
[03:38.970 --> 03:40.330]  So that's a good start.
[03:40.330 --> 03:45.770]  It says, my plan is to search this pack for a breeding male, then hit that pollen to some
[03:45.770 --> 03:47.590]  proven females.
[03:47.690 --> 03:49.690]  That is a really good strategy.
[03:49.690 --> 03:53.990]  There are a couple of things I want to touch on before I get too much further.
[03:53.990 --> 03:58.490]  A lot of breeders in this industry, in this game, in this community, do not like it when
[03:58.490 --> 04:03.490]  new growers or growers or breeders work with their stuff for breeding purposes.
[04:03.490 --> 04:06.910]  They find it, they are territorial, they are possessive.
[04:06.910 --> 04:09.390]  They want to have some control over their plants.
[04:09.390 --> 04:10.790]  I don't feel that way.
[04:10.790 --> 04:15.910]  If you have acquired seeds or plants of mine, if you paid for them, if you traded for them,
[04:15.910 --> 04:20.330]  if you didn't steal them, even if you did steal them, I can't stop you.
[04:20.330 --> 04:25.910]  You have permission, rights, my blessings to breed with the seeds that I have made.
[04:25.910 --> 04:27.270]  I did not invent cannabis.
[04:27.270 --> 04:29.350]  I didn't pull seeds out of the sky.
[04:29.350 --> 04:31.590]  I didn't fart out some seeds and breed with those.
[04:31.590 --> 04:35.870]  I used seeds and plants that were bred by other breeders before me.
[04:35.870 --> 04:39.330]  So I find no problem in breeding with my stock.
[04:39.330 --> 04:44.370]  If you find a male or a female in a pack of my seeds that you want to work with, I highly
[04:44.370 --> 04:47.930]  encourage and promote you to do the breeding work.
[04:47.930 --> 04:50.210]  The only thing I can ask for is credit.
[04:50.210 --> 04:54.010]  If you sell those seeds, if you post them anywhere, if the pictures of those buds get
[04:54.010 --> 04:58.330]  any recognition, when you do list the cross, give me some credit.
[04:58.330 --> 05:03.770]  Put that that was a dark hollow male from iRegenetics that was used for the pollen donor,
[05:03.770 --> 05:07.930]  or put that it was a strawberry starburst or a orange chasm or a sun-kissed female,
[05:07.930 --> 05:10.050]  whatever you use, just give me credit.
[05:10.050 --> 05:11.690]  That's all that I really want.
[05:11.690 --> 05:15.290]  Also, a few seeds would be cool if you want to send me beans.
[05:15.290 --> 05:16.290]  That would be polite.
[05:16.290 --> 05:20.250]  However, I don't have time or space to run them right now anyway, so that wouldn't be
[05:20.250 --> 05:22.770]  too much of a setback if I didn't get that pack.
[05:22.770 --> 05:25.570]  If you did send them, I would find time to run them.
[05:25.570 --> 05:29.570]  And when I do run them, I would send you a clone of the keeper is usually how that works.
[05:29.570 --> 05:34.410]  Anyway, I wanted to make sure that people do know, realize, and understand you've got
[05:34.410 --> 05:37.930]  full permission to breed with the seeds you've acquired from me.
[05:37.930 --> 05:39.950]  Once you pay for those, they're yours.
[05:40.670 --> 05:43.630]  If you bought a Ferrari and the car dealer tried to tell you,
[05:43.630 --> 05:46.470]  you can't drive this car like an asshole, what is the point?
[05:46.470 --> 05:49.750]  You bought a Ferrari, you want to drive like an asshole, go have fun.
[05:49.750 --> 05:52.110]  I feel the same about my seeds.
[05:52.110 --> 05:55.470]  Now I said there was a couple of things I wanted to unpack in that statement.
[05:55.470 --> 05:56.770]  One more thing I want to talk about.
[05:56.770 --> 06:01.010]  You have got a pack of dark hollow seeds and you are looking for a male.
[06:01.010 --> 06:04.670]  One thing I always say is when we get seeds, when we get a seed pack, we're probably going
[06:04.670 --> 06:08.710]  to get, you've probably got a 10 pack, you're probably going to find approximately five
[06:08.710 --> 06:10.710]  males, five females.
[06:10.710 --> 06:16.990]  Something I want to mention is when it comes to breeding, I never use the first male plant
[06:16.990 --> 06:21.570]  of the bunch that shows me it's a boy for my breeding project.
[06:21.570 --> 06:28.870]  That first plant to display male traits, in my opinion, is going to be too much male for
[06:28.870 --> 06:29.870]  the mix.
[06:29.870 --> 06:32.110]  Let me try to explain what I mean.
[06:32.110 --> 06:37.750]  That first dude to show you that he's a boy is just too much testosterone.
[06:38.750 --> 06:41.270]  There's nothing wrong with that plant, but I wouldn't use him for breeding.
[06:41.270 --> 06:45.350]  He's going to put too much of himself into the offspring.
[06:45.350 --> 06:51.270]  A lot of times my goal when I'm breeding is to mix or blend the male and the female and
[06:51.270 --> 06:55.590]  have traits of both parent plants show in the offspring.
[06:55.590 --> 07:00.430]  If we use a male plant that is too dominant, we're just going to be reproducing that male
[07:00.430 --> 07:02.470]  plant in all of the progeny.
[07:02.470 --> 07:08.830]  If you cross that male plant to strawberry, to orange, to bubblegum, you're going to wash
[07:08.830 --> 07:12.670]  out the orange and the strawberry and the bubblegum and just recreate more of that male
[07:12.670 --> 07:17.030]  plant because he's got too much of his genetics into the mix.
[07:17.030 --> 07:22.410]  A lot of times I completely skip the first and second male to start showing me that they
[07:22.410 --> 07:23.990]  are male plants.
[07:23.990 --> 07:28.910]  Oftentimes those are really tall, really stretchy, really fibrous plants, and we don't want to
[07:28.910 --> 07:31.510]  breed tall, stretchy, fibrous offspring.
[07:31.550 --> 07:36.190]  We want to make vigorous, potent offspring, so get rid of those tall, stretchy dudes that
[07:36.190 --> 07:38.150]  are just going to make tall, stretchy offspring.
[07:38.150 --> 07:39.550]  We're not trying to make hemp here.
[07:39.550 --> 07:41.910]  We want to make cannabis.
[07:41.910 --> 07:47.350]  I would get rid of the first, maybe even the second dude to show me that it's a dude.
[07:47.350 --> 07:51.350]  I usually work with that third or fourth male out of a group of five.
[07:51.350 --> 07:56.270]  Honestly, I would rather have more seeds to choose from, but if you've got quality seeds,
[07:56.270 --> 07:58.190]  you will find a keeper in that 10-pack.
[07:58.190 --> 08:00.710]  You will find a boy worth working with.
[08:00.910 --> 08:04.590]  Now, I think I've unpacked the two things I wanted to talk about in there.
[08:04.590 --> 08:07.790]  Let's move forward and read more of this message.
[08:07.790 --> 08:12.350]  It does go on to say, I've always been a fan of the strain-specific episodes, and I was
[08:12.350 --> 08:17.670]  wondering if you would consider doing one on King Solomon to help me find a boy with
[08:17.670 --> 08:23.430]  similar traits to help me understand what makes him special compared to other male plants.
[08:23.430 --> 08:25.510]  All right, that is a great question.
[08:25.510 --> 08:29.310]  I love that you appreciate the strain-specific episodes.
[08:29.390 --> 08:34.230]  I feel like those are bragging or tooting my own horn or advertising or whatever, but
[08:34.230 --> 08:37.510]  I love that you guys appreciate those, so thank you.
[08:37.510 --> 08:41.150]  In this episode, what I'm going to try to do is kind of a mashup.
[08:41.150 --> 08:43.030]  We're going to talk about Solomon.
[08:43.030 --> 08:46.990]  We're going to talk about his traits, what he is, why I selected him, why he works so
[08:46.990 --> 08:48.470]  well for me.
[08:48.470 --> 08:53.350]  In that same process, we're going to talk about everybody else selecting a male plant
[08:53.350 --> 08:54.990]  for a breeding project.
[08:54.990 --> 08:59.990]  You have to keep in mind here is we've got different goals or possibly different goals.
[08:59.990 --> 09:02.870]  I don't know your total outcome goal here.
[09:02.870 --> 09:07.230]  You said you want to cross the dark hollow with a few proven females, and then we'll
[09:07.230 --> 09:08.550]  see what that does.
[09:08.550 --> 09:10.450]  I don't know your ultimate goal.
[09:10.450 --> 09:15.470]  My goal is to make seeds for commercial production and for retail sales.
[09:15.470 --> 09:16.750]  I've got a goal.
[09:16.750 --> 09:20.110]  My seeds have to work in a variety of grow spaces.
[09:20.110 --> 09:21.870]  They've got to germinate well.
[09:21.870 --> 09:23.910]  They've got to give us what we're expecting.
[09:23.910 --> 09:25.270]  I don't know your goal.
[09:25.270 --> 09:26.310]  We've got different goals.
[09:26.310 --> 09:29.390]  We've also got a different male plant to work with here.
[09:29.390 --> 09:30.830]  It's all about the goal.
[09:30.830 --> 09:34.870]  Keep that in mind that we've got different goals and different starting ingredients,
[09:34.870 --> 09:36.730]  but I'm sure that you can follow along.
[09:36.730 --> 09:41.750]  Let's jump right into it and talk about what is King Solomon.
[09:41.750 --> 09:48.590]  King Solomon is a specially selected male plant from a batch of Arise F1 seeds.
[09:48.590 --> 09:50.110]  What the heck does that mean?
[09:50.110 --> 09:57.210]  I took a golden goat female and a daybreaker male, and I pollinated the golden goat female.
[09:57.210 --> 10:00.190]  That made Arise F1.
[10:00.190 --> 10:06.130]  From that batch of Arise F1 seeds, I found a male that stood out to me in many ways for
[10:06.130 --> 10:07.790]  many reasons.
[10:07.790 --> 10:10.390]  That male has been named King Solomon.
[10:10.390 --> 10:14.330]  I've got one plant that is a dude with his own specific name.
[10:14.330 --> 10:15.750]  That's how much I like him.
[10:15.750 --> 10:17.530]  That's how much I rely on him.
[10:17.530 --> 10:19.390]  That's how successful he has been.
[10:19.390 --> 10:23.270]  If you're curious about the name, that is some Torah biblical stuff.
[10:23.270 --> 10:25.110]  Research King Solomon.
[10:25.110 --> 10:26.150]  King Solomon was a king.
[10:26.150 --> 10:27.830]  He could have had anything he wanted.
[10:27.830 --> 10:31.070]  His weaknesses was that he loved the ladies.
[10:31.070 --> 10:35.550]  So I named my male plant Solomon because he has pollinated a lot of ladies.
[10:35.550 --> 10:38.230]  He's doing work spreading his generations.
[10:38.230 --> 10:41.890]  So King Solomon is an Arise F1 male.
[10:41.890 --> 10:44.430]  Just an Arise male selected from a batch of seeds.
[10:44.430 --> 10:45.910]  I love the way he grew.
[10:45.910 --> 10:47.270]  I knew he was going to stick around.
[10:47.270 --> 10:49.510]  I gave him his own name.
[10:49.510 --> 10:50.790]  He is King Solomon.
[10:50.790 --> 10:51.790]  I call him Saul.
[10:51.790 --> 10:53.510]  I call him Sully.
[10:53.510 --> 10:55.110]  He gets a lot of names around here.
[10:55.110 --> 10:56.390]  He gets a lot of love.
[10:56.390 --> 11:00.190]  So that is King Solomon, an F1 Arise male.
[11:00.190 --> 11:04.150]  Now let's talk about why I chose that male.
[11:04.150 --> 11:05.150]  Why did I choose him?
[11:05.150 --> 11:09.990]  I grew out a bunch of seeds and I ran a bunch of male plants side by side.
[11:09.990 --> 11:11.990]  And this is the one that stood out.
[11:11.990 --> 11:12.990]  Why?
[11:12.990 --> 11:14.830]  I really liked the vigor.
[11:14.830 --> 11:16.970]  This plant has got hyper vigor.
[11:17.670 --> 11:19.050]  He veges super quickly.
[11:19.050 --> 11:21.170]  He flowers super quickly.
[11:21.170 --> 11:25.610]  A lot of people tell me that they have to adjust their scheduling differently because
[11:25.610 --> 11:30.930]  they are growing Arise crosses in their grow and the plants veg so quickly they can cut
[11:30.930 --> 11:33.590]  off a week or two weeks of veg time.
[11:33.590 --> 11:36.070]  So that is how quickly Arise grows.
[11:36.070 --> 11:40.590]  That trait from that male plant that passes on to most of his offspring.
[11:40.590 --> 11:41.930]  So he's got great vigor.
[11:41.930 --> 11:44.130]  That is one of the main traits that I like about him.
[11:44.450 --> 11:47.490]  He's also known for having good resistance.
[11:47.490 --> 11:53.050]  Many of his progeny, the offspring he makes, are resistant to pathogens, powdery mildew,
[11:53.050 --> 11:55.690]  mold, and also bugs like spider mites.
[11:55.690 --> 12:00.650]  You see a lot of these plants don't get as badly affected by bugs as many other plants
[12:00.650 --> 12:01.650]  in the garden.
[12:01.650 --> 12:05.950]  I also really like the shape and the structure of King Solomon.
[12:05.950 --> 12:10.370]  He's got a good shape and a good structure and that translates into the plants that come
[12:10.370 --> 12:11.370]  from him.
[12:11.370 --> 12:15.290]  His progeny have a good shape and a good structure and hyper vigor.
[12:15.290 --> 12:18.010]  So that is really important for a male plant.
[12:18.010 --> 12:22.050]  Now let's talk about one of the most obvious and most important traits that come from King
[12:22.050 --> 12:23.050]  Solomon.
[12:23.050 --> 12:28.050]  Solomon is known for passing on extremely high potency.
[12:28.050 --> 12:30.410]  Everything Solomon touches turns to gold.
[12:30.410 --> 12:32.730]  In my opinion, it comes out vigorous.
[12:32.730 --> 12:33.830]  It's got good structure.
[12:33.830 --> 12:37.290]  It grows quite quickly and it is super potent.
[12:37.290 --> 12:41.850]  Sometimes I call King Solomon the fixer or the corrector plant because I'll have a female
[12:41.850 --> 12:46.570]  plant that I really like the way that it grows, but it's just missing something.
[12:46.570 --> 12:48.850]  Maybe it's not putting out enough harvest weight.
[12:48.850 --> 12:50.930]  Maybe it's not putting out enough potency.
[12:50.930 --> 12:52.630]  Maybe it doesn't grow quickly enough.
[12:52.630 --> 12:57.890]  So I will pollinate it with King Solomon and that seems to improve and put other plants
[12:57.890 --> 12:59.370]  into turbo charge.
[12:59.370 --> 13:03.970]  Whatever I pollinate it with, the offspring is the female plant plus turbo.
[13:03.970 --> 13:09.370]  It is the female plant plus more trichomes, more potency and more vigor and more harvest
[13:09.370 --> 13:10.370]  weight.
[13:10.370 --> 13:12.850]  So that's a big part of why Solomon is a great male.
[13:12.850 --> 13:18.050]  He adds resistance, he adds vigor, he adds potency and he doesn't disrupt the flavor
[13:18.050 --> 13:19.050]  too much.
[13:19.050 --> 13:22.690]  If I have a female plant that's got a great flavor, I know that Saul is going to go in
[13:22.690 --> 13:26.810]  there and fix the structure, the potency, and he's going to leave that flavor that the
[13:26.810 --> 13:27.810]  females got.
[13:27.810 --> 13:29.710]  So I can find that good balance.
[13:29.710 --> 13:33.650]  That's why I like to cross it to, uh, you've seen it cross to a strawberry plant, not a
[13:34.330 --> 13:37.890]  strawberry, but a strawberry flavored plant, an orange flavored plant, a blueberry flavored
[13:37.890 --> 13:41.370]  plant because I like to keep those turps and those flavors in there.
[13:41.370 --> 13:43.850]  But I want to add that vigor, that potency.
[13:43.850 --> 13:46.510]  I think it's really coming from King Solomon.
[13:46.510 --> 13:50.090]  So that potency is a main factor that everybody relies on.
[13:50.090 --> 13:51.570]  We love that potency.
[13:51.570 --> 13:53.770]  I also love that it is a fixer.
[13:53.770 --> 13:57.650]  Like I said, if there's a plant that's just not performing the way that I need it to pollinate
[13:57.650 --> 14:02.450]  it with King Solomon, the seeds that come from that will be that original female plus
[14:02.450 --> 14:08.130]  turbo plus bonus plus diesel plus supercharge because we hit it with King Solomon.
[14:08.130 --> 14:12.130]  It gives it that potency and then it doesn't ruin the flavor, but it gives it, it just
[14:12.130 --> 14:13.290]  turbo charges the flavor.
[14:13.290 --> 14:15.970]  It kind of adds a little gas to it, a little funk to it.
[14:15.970 --> 14:20.770]  And who doesn't love a little gas, a little funk added to almost any strain you're smoking.
[14:20.770 --> 14:22.570]  So that's a big part of why we chose Solomon.
[14:22.570 --> 14:24.610]  Let me take a look at these notes here.
[14:24.610 --> 14:28.170]  It does not ruin the buzz and it doesn't overpower the crosses.
[14:28.170 --> 14:30.130]  It lets the female shine.
[14:30.130 --> 14:31.970]  That's something I find important.
[14:31.970 --> 14:35.890]  If we're trying to make a cross, I like to see the male traits and the female traits
[14:35.890 --> 14:36.890]  in the cross.
[14:36.890 --> 14:42.050]  So I want that potency, the vigor, the aggression from a rise, but then I still want those strawberry
[14:42.050 --> 14:44.010]  turps and that plant structure.
[14:44.010 --> 14:49.210]  And I want to see both of them in the mix and a rise tends to not over dominate in the
[14:49.210 --> 14:50.650]  crosses.
[14:50.650 --> 14:54.450]  So that is basically why I have chosen King Solomon.
[14:54.450 --> 14:55.850]  He adds vigor.
[14:55.850 --> 14:56.850]  He adds aroma.
[14:56.850 --> 14:58.490]  He adds potency.
[14:58.490 --> 14:59.490]  He adds resistance.
[14:59.490 --> 15:00.490]  He fixes things.
[15:00.490 --> 15:04.770]  If you've got a plant that is not living up to par, that is doing a lot of great things,
[15:04.770 --> 15:09.590]  but it's missing something, King Solomon likely will add what it is missing.
[15:09.590 --> 15:11.210]  That's why I've chosen to breed.
[15:11.210 --> 15:16.050]  Almost everything in my garden gets pollinated by King Solomon and then we see what it does.
[15:16.050 --> 15:18.490]  Now let's talk about your breeding project.
[15:18.490 --> 15:20.530]  Your project is different than mine.
[15:20.530 --> 15:23.530]  It starts off different because you've got a different male.
[15:23.530 --> 15:27.370]  We can't make the same thing because you don't have the same male as me, which is good.
[15:27.370 --> 15:29.050]  I'm already making a rise crosses.
[15:29.050 --> 15:31.730]  A lot of people are already making a rise crosses.
[15:31.730 --> 15:36.070]  You're going to make some dark hollow crosses, which will be great, but we've got to, I want
[15:36.070 --> 15:41.890]  to help you select your male and give you some ideas of how to select that dude.
[15:41.890 --> 15:42.890]  What is your goal?
[15:42.890 --> 15:47.730]  The most important part of any breeding project is knowing a goal.
[15:47.730 --> 15:48.730]  What do you want to do?
[15:48.730 --> 15:50.730]  What do you want to create?
[15:50.730 --> 15:51.730]  What are you lacking?
[15:51.730 --> 15:53.370]  What is not in your garden?
[15:53.370 --> 15:55.650]  Maybe you've got a female plant that you want to fix.
[15:55.650 --> 15:58.550]  What is that female plant not giving you?
[15:58.550 --> 16:03.110]  Before you do this cross, before you chuck any pollen, write down the male plants you're
[16:03.110 --> 16:06.670]  going to use, the male plant you are going to use, and the female plants you're going
[16:06.670 --> 16:07.870]  to use.
[16:07.870 --> 16:13.270]  List the females, then make kind of a prediction, a hypothesis, a theory.
[16:13.270 --> 16:15.790]  What are these crosses going to be like once you make them?
[16:15.790 --> 16:20.990]  If you cross this dark hollow male to female number one, what is your predicted goal?
[16:20.990 --> 16:23.110]  What will the aromas and flavors be like?
[16:23.110 --> 16:24.390]  How will it grow?
[16:24.390 --> 16:26.150]  What phenotypes are you looking for?
[16:26.150 --> 16:27.390]  Why did you do this?
[16:27.390 --> 16:30.230]  List that for every cross you're about to make.
[16:30.230 --> 16:32.150]  Then make the cross.
[16:32.150 --> 16:36.750]  Then the funnest part is growing out those seeds to see what you did.
[16:36.750 --> 16:42.070]  The only way to find out what your male plant is doing to the crosses is by pollinating
[16:42.070 --> 16:47.790]  several females and then growing those out and looking at the differences in those crosses.
[16:47.790 --> 16:52.910]  When you cross it to strawberry, does it still taste like strawberry or does it taste like
[16:52.910 --> 16:55.210]  strawberry or did we wash that out?
[16:55.210 --> 16:59.570]  When you cross it to blueberry, does it taste like blueberry or did we wash that out?
[16:59.570 --> 17:03.250]  Did it get the vigor of the male plant, the terps of the female?
[17:03.250 --> 17:04.250]  What's it doing?
[17:04.250 --> 17:06.410]  Find out what it is contributing to the mix.
[17:06.410 --> 17:09.890]  If you just cross it to one plant, you're only going to see one set of traits.
[17:09.890 --> 17:13.370]  It's hard to identify what the male is doing unless it's really obvious.
[17:13.370 --> 17:18.150]  If you put it to several females, we can really see what the effects are on all of those different
[17:18.150 --> 17:19.610]  female plants.
[17:19.610 --> 17:24.190]  So I would start off by looking for a plant with the structure you are looking for.
[17:24.190 --> 17:26.790]  How do you want your future plants to be shaped?
[17:26.790 --> 17:31.410]  I like kind of taller plants because I like those sativa dominant plants with big colas
[17:31.410 --> 17:36.390]  because I like a lot of herb and I like a really head ripping head buzz and I think
[17:36.390 --> 17:40.770]  sativa dominant tall skinny plants give me that head buzz I'm looking for.
[17:40.770 --> 17:44.970]  So I would look for tall skinny plants with long skinny leaves.
[17:44.970 --> 17:46.650]  Maybe that's not what you want.
[17:46.650 --> 17:49.450]  Find the leaf shape and plant structure that you want.
[17:49.450 --> 17:52.990]  We know that bigger, wider leaves are usually more endica dominant.
[17:52.990 --> 17:55.390]  And your leaves are going to be more sativa dominant.
[17:55.390 --> 17:59.110]  Find the leaf shape and plant structure that suits your goal.
[17:59.110 --> 18:00.670]  What are you looking for?
[18:00.670 --> 18:03.550]  Then one thing to think about is aroma and flavor.
[18:03.550 --> 18:05.490]  What does this plant smell like?
[18:05.490 --> 18:06.530]  Give it a stem rub.
[18:06.530 --> 18:07.610]  Smell your fingers.
[18:07.610 --> 18:08.730]  Does it smell like vomit?
[18:08.730 --> 18:09.930]  Does it smell like trash can?
[18:09.930 --> 18:10.930]  Does it smell like fruit?
[18:10.930 --> 18:12.710]  Does it smell like berries?
[18:12.710 --> 18:14.150]  What are you looking for?
[18:14.150 --> 18:17.390]  I really like a male plant that smells like vomit.
[18:17.390 --> 18:22.330]  If the male plant smells acrid and gross, that's probably going to translate into good
[18:22.370 --> 18:24.310]  stuff in the offspring.
[18:24.310 --> 18:25.990]  Keep in mind this is one ingredient.
[18:25.990 --> 18:27.730]  This isn't the total equation.
[18:27.730 --> 18:33.130]  You're going to add that dirty, stinky socks, gasoline and bar trash can to other things
[18:33.130 --> 18:34.930]  and see how they mix together.
[18:34.930 --> 18:40.050]  So I really like a male that's got a nasty, gross, acrid, putrid, vomit, bar trash can
[18:40.050 --> 18:41.590]  kind of aroma.
[18:41.590 --> 18:46.730]  Now another really important thing to think about in my opinion is flowering time.
[18:46.730 --> 18:49.350]  Do you want plants to take a long time to flower?
[18:49.350 --> 18:52.690]  In my opinion, longer flowering plants get better potency.
[18:52.690 --> 18:54.790]  I just like that longer flowering plant.
[18:54.790 --> 18:56.950]  I feel like it can do something more with the potency.
[18:56.950 --> 18:58.470]  The buzz is better.
[18:58.470 --> 19:01.770]  Or do you need a rush plant that gets out of there in eight weeks?
[19:01.770 --> 19:05.830]  Then I would find a male that finishes the flowers in eight weeks.
[19:05.830 --> 19:09.750]  If you need a plant that finishes sooner, I would find a faster flowering male.
[19:09.750 --> 19:13.950]  The only way to do that is to let the males flower out in the test room.
[19:13.950 --> 19:15.830]  So let me talk about that for a little bit.
[19:15.830 --> 19:19.950]  I might not even pollinate with the first run of growing this male plant.
[19:19.950 --> 19:22.870]  I might grow out five male plants and finish them.
[19:22.870 --> 19:24.110]  Let them go nine weeks.
[19:24.110 --> 19:27.210]  Let them go 10 weeks and see what they do at week 10.
[19:27.210 --> 19:29.190]  You may watch one plant bulk up.
[19:29.190 --> 19:30.670]  It may stop making pollen.
[19:30.670 --> 19:32.410]  It may keep making pollen.
[19:32.410 --> 19:33.570]  Those are things to look for.
[19:33.570 --> 19:36.150]  How does that plant act at a few weeks into flower?
[19:36.150 --> 19:37.790]  Seven, eight, nine.
[19:37.790 --> 19:38.790]  Does it do weird shit?
[19:38.790 --> 19:40.110]  Does it give you nutrient issues?
[19:40.110 --> 19:42.910]  Does it start doing, does it explode with growth?
[19:42.910 --> 19:44.350]  Does it stop putting out trichomes?
[19:44.350 --> 19:46.190]  Does it start putting out trichomes?
[19:46.190 --> 19:47.590]  Pay attention to that.
[19:47.590 --> 19:50.390]  Grow that male plant out as long as you can.
[19:50.390 --> 19:54.670]  Then the next time you run it is when you want to collect the pollen and do the pollination.
[19:54.670 --> 19:59.150]  I wouldn't collect pollen if you've got multiple dudes around because who knows, it's going
[19:59.150 --> 20:00.430]  to be a Maury situation.
[20:00.430 --> 20:04.230]  We won't know who the baby daddy is if you've got multiple dudes around.
[20:04.230 --> 20:06.690]  So grow those dudes out, flower them.
[20:06.690 --> 20:07.690]  See what they do.
[20:07.690 --> 20:08.750]  See how they perform.
[20:08.750 --> 20:09.890]  How do they handle nutrients?
[20:09.890 --> 20:11.510]  How do they handle light?
[20:11.510 --> 20:12.510]  What's going on?
[20:12.510 --> 20:13.510]  Lay it in flower.
[20:13.670 --> 20:17.430]  You don't even know what a male plant is going to look like at week 10.
[20:17.430 --> 20:19.210]  Get your boys to week nine, week 10.
[20:19.210 --> 20:20.390]  See what they do.
[20:20.390 --> 20:21.950]  Pick one from there.
[20:21.950 --> 20:24.310]  Then do the pollination in the next run.
[20:24.310 --> 20:25.710]  That's what I would do.
[20:25.710 --> 20:27.370]  So then that is the main part.
[20:27.370 --> 20:29.030]  You get to do pollination.
[20:29.030 --> 20:30.430]  Pollinate the plants.
[20:30.430 --> 20:31.950]  Then finish those seeds.
[20:31.950 --> 20:34.870]  Then that is when we really get to do the test.
[20:34.870 --> 20:35.870]  Germinate those seeds.
[20:35.870 --> 20:36.870]  Do they germinate?
[20:36.870 --> 20:40.750]  If they don't germinate, I wouldn't really continue too far making more of those seeds.
[20:40.750 --> 20:42.610]  Then after pollination is the fun part.
[20:42.710 --> 20:44.690]  You get to wait for the seeds to finish.
[20:44.690 --> 20:46.290]  Then you get to harvest them.
[20:46.290 --> 20:48.530]  Pull the seeds out of each plant that you pollinated.
[20:48.530 --> 20:49.530]  Keep them separate.
[20:49.530 --> 20:52.210]  Make sure they're labeled so you know what you're growing.
[20:52.210 --> 20:53.810]  Then grow as many as you can.
[20:53.810 --> 20:54.930]  I don't know your legalities.
[20:54.930 --> 20:56.690]  I don't know your limitations.
[20:56.690 --> 21:00.370]  But I would grow at least 10 of each one and take a lot of notes.
[21:00.370 --> 21:01.730]  See what they do.
[21:01.730 --> 21:05.290]  Compare similarities and differences between each cross.
[21:05.290 --> 21:08.890]  Then we can see what that male plant is doing to the mix.
[21:08.890 --> 21:12.570]  If you don't like what he did, don't be afraid to throw those seeds away.
[21:12.570 --> 21:13.570]  Give them away.
[21:13.570 --> 21:14.570]  Flush them.
[21:14.570 --> 21:15.570]  Whatever you want to do.
[21:15.570 --> 21:17.650]  Just let people know that that wasn't a winner.
[21:17.650 --> 21:18.930]  Don't sell them as winner seeds.
[21:18.930 --> 21:20.930]  That'll mess up your reputation.
[21:20.930 --> 21:22.090]  But try again.
[21:22.090 --> 21:23.290]  Don't be afraid to try again.
[21:23.290 --> 21:25.470]  I have thrown away a lot of seeds.
[21:25.470 --> 21:26.970]  Don't be shy to throw seeds away.
[21:26.970 --> 21:28.290]  Feed them to the birds.
[21:28.290 --> 21:30.010]  Use them as compost.
[21:30.010 --> 21:33.210]  Don't put out shitty seeds to the community, please.
[21:33.210 --> 21:36.690]  But the main way to find out what you've done, the only way really to find out what you've
[21:36.690 --> 21:39.810]  done is to grow those seeds.
[21:39.810 --> 21:40.810]  It's really fun.
[21:40.810 --> 21:46.610]  In my opinion, growing a male plant, finding a male, then pollinating some multiple female
[21:46.610 --> 21:50.930]  plants, then growing those and seeing the similarities and the differences in all of
[21:50.930 --> 21:51.930]  those plants.
[21:51.930 --> 21:56.050]  If you've grown anything of mine that's been crossed to a rise, if you've grown more than
[21:56.050 --> 22:00.450]  one or two of those crosses, you can see what Solomon is doing and what the females are
[22:00.450 --> 22:02.390]  doing to that cross.
[22:02.390 --> 22:06.770]  After a lot of growing and breeding, it will become very obvious to you what the male plant
[22:06.770 --> 22:08.290]  is doing and what the female is doing.
[22:08.290 --> 22:10.930]  You'll start to identify that very quickly.
[22:10.930 --> 22:12.090]  It's like learning your children.
[22:12.090 --> 22:15.570]  You can say, oh, you got that from your father or you got that from your mother.
[22:15.570 --> 22:19.810]  You'll start to see that and it becomes very natural, very obvious, very quickly.
[22:19.810 --> 22:22.970]  I think that is called developing an eye for breeding.
[22:22.970 --> 22:26.650]  It took me a long time to do that, but now I can just look at plants and I go, man, I
[22:26.650 --> 22:29.570]  need to pollinate that girl with Solomon and it will make this.
[22:29.570 --> 22:35.050]  Then 90% of the time, my predictions in my head come out exactly how I expected them.
[22:35.250 --> 22:39.050]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[22:39.050 --> 22:43.730]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, my friend Darcy, thank you guys for listening to this
[22:43.730 --> 22:44.730]  episode.
[22:44.730 --> 22:45.730]  My throat is burning out.
[22:45.730 --> 22:49.210]  My voice is going to be completely gone here pretty soon, so it is time for me to wrap
[22:49.210 --> 22:50.410]  up this episode.
[22:50.410 --> 22:51.490]  I hope you learned a lot.
[22:51.490 --> 22:53.370]  I hope I answered your question.
[22:53.370 --> 22:57.050]  I choose my male based on the goal.
[22:57.050 --> 22:59.010]  Then I check for a certain criteria.
[22:59.010 --> 23:00.010]  How is it shaped?
[23:00.010 --> 23:01.010]  How is it smell?
[23:01.010 --> 23:02.010]  How does it grow?
[23:02.010 --> 23:04.010]  Does it give me enough pollen to make seeds?
[23:04.010 --> 23:06.110]  How long is that pollen window?
[23:06.110 --> 23:07.110]  Does it make trichomes?
[23:07.110 --> 23:08.290]  Does it make colors?
[23:08.290 --> 23:09.770]  How does it smell?
[23:09.770 --> 23:11.730]  DJ Short smokes his male plants.
[23:11.730 --> 23:13.810]  He dries out the buds and smokes the flowers.
[23:13.810 --> 23:14.930]  I don't do that.
[23:14.930 --> 23:16.170]  DJ Short does that.
[23:16.170 --> 23:17.450]  Maybe that's something you will do.
[23:17.450 --> 23:19.970]  See if that male plant gives you a buzz.
[23:19.970 --> 23:23.370]  Then once you've selected your male plant that you find appropriate, pollinate your
[23:23.370 --> 23:24.890]  female plants.
[23:24.890 --> 23:27.650]  Then pollinate multiple females is my advice.
[23:27.650 --> 23:29.770]  Then grow out as many of those as you can.
[23:29.770 --> 23:30.770]  Compare notes.
[23:30.770 --> 23:33.970]  See what that male is delivering to the cross.
[23:33.970 --> 23:37.970]  If that male is doing what you want it to do, pollinate a bunch more plants.
[23:37.970 --> 23:39.770]  Continue with filial generations.
[23:39.770 --> 23:42.570]  If it's not doing what you want, get more seeds.
[23:42.570 --> 23:43.810]  Find another dude.
[23:43.810 --> 23:44.810]  Start over.
[23:44.810 --> 23:45.810]  Take a lot of notes.
[23:45.810 --> 23:49.810]  Don't ever be afraid to scrap a breeding project or go backwards.
[23:49.810 --> 23:50.810]  Sometimes that's how it works.
[23:50.810 --> 23:52.770]  We don't always make the right selections.
[23:52.770 --> 23:54.090]  It is always about selection.
[23:54.090 --> 23:55.090]  All right.
[23:55.090 --> 23:56.530]  That's all I've got for you for this episode.
[23:56.530 --> 23:59.170]  I feel like my voice is about to be completely gone.
[23:59.170 --> 24:00.650]  I'll check in with you in a few days.
[24:00.890 --> 24:04.130]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy, Billy Bong Smokin'.
[24:04.130 --> 24:07.530]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
