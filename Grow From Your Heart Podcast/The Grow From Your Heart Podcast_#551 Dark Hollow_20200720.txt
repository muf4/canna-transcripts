[00:13.110 --> 00:14.390]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:14.390 --> 00:19.450]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and it is time for episode 551 of the Grow

[00:57.770 --> 01:03.810]  You know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:03.810 --> 01:08.170]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Halo Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[01:08.450 --> 01:11.530]  This is a blend of Headbanger and Infinity OG.
[01:11.530 --> 01:15.690]  On the package, the flavor is described as deconstructed sour diesel.
[01:15.690 --> 01:19.730]  I'm not sure what a deconstructed sour diesel is supposed to taste like.
[01:19.730 --> 01:26.130]  I do know that this concentrate was sour and gassy and fuely and funky, and I do know that
[01:26.130 --> 01:27.730]  it got me heavily medicated.
[01:27.730 --> 01:34.170]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Halo Live Batter.
[01:34.170 --> 01:37.650]  All right, in this episode, I'm going to do a strain review.
[01:38.130 --> 01:40.130]  We're going to focus on my strain, Dark Hollow.
[01:40.130 --> 01:46.250]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few folks who support the show on Patreon
[01:46.250 --> 01:48.050]  at the 710 level or higher.

[02:06.810 --> 02:08.210]  I hope that's how you say that, bro.
[02:08.210 --> 02:09.970]  If I'm saying it wrong, send me a correction.
[02:09.970 --> 02:12.090]  I'll give you an appropriate shout out.
[02:12.090 --> 02:16.050]  I also have a big thank you shout out to my buddy, David H. Let's send a big thank you

[02:21.410 --> 02:22.970]  Thank you for all the support, bro.
[02:22.970 --> 02:25.850]  Let's also send a big thank you shout out to my buddy, The Canna Crat.
[02:25.850 --> 02:26.850]  Big fist bump.
[02:26.850 --> 02:28.130]  Thank you for all the continued support.
[02:28.130 --> 02:32.250]  I've also got a big thank you shout out for my friend, John K. Let's send a big thank
[02:32.250 --> 02:35.570]  you shout out to Okie Gross 720, keeping it real down there.

[02:50.250 --> 02:54.210]  If you're not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[02:54.210 --> 03:00.690]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:00.690 --> 03:03.610]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[03:03.610 --> 03:07.610]  And I did include a link in the show notes and the video description to make it easy
[03:07.610 --> 03:09.770]  to get there for my stoner friends.
[03:09.770 --> 03:15.570]  And I did start to include the HTTPS colon backslash part of the link.
[03:15.570 --> 03:17.610]  So the link will actually work now.
[03:17.610 --> 03:20.970]  I was typing in www.patreon.com.
[03:20.970 --> 03:24.010]  I was not making an actual link in the YouTube video description.
[03:24.010 --> 03:25.370]  I have corrected that.
[03:25.370 --> 03:28.650]  Big thank you to the person who gave me that little tidbit of advice.
[03:28.650 --> 03:33.330]  I am very open to constructive criticism and corrections and updates.
[03:33.330 --> 03:34.570]  Send me anything like that.

[03:35.490 --> 03:36.450]  That helps me out.
[03:36.450 --> 03:38.170]  That helps you out, helps us all out.
[03:38.170 --> 03:38.890]  Thank you.
[03:38.890 --> 03:44.050]  Once again, big thank you and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[03:44.050 --> 03:46.170]  I do appreciate that support.
[03:46.170 --> 03:49.490]  Now, I did say we were going to do a strain review in this episode,
[03:49.490 --> 03:51.970]  and we're going to talk about Dark Hollow.
[03:51.970 --> 03:55.370]  Let's jump right into that part of the podcast.
[03:55.370 --> 03:57.810]  Strain reviews are always some of my favorite episodes,
[03:57.810 --> 04:00.090]  and it seems like you guys really enjoy them too.
[04:00.090 --> 04:01.970]  I get to talk about something I created.
[04:01.970 --> 04:03.970]  This is like showing you pictures of my kids.
[04:03.970 --> 04:05.770]  This is a really good time for me.
[04:05.770 --> 04:09.210]  At the same time, you guys get to learn a lot about the products I create.
[04:09.210 --> 04:13.170]  You get a little bit of insight into my brain of what my goals are and what I'm trying to do.
[04:13.170 --> 04:16.570]  With a little less rambling, let's get right into it.
[04:16.570 --> 04:17.610]  Dark Hollow.
[04:17.610 --> 04:20.450]  Dark Hollow is one of my newest releases.
[04:20.450 --> 04:28.530]  I am mostly known for making candy, fruity, real turpy, real high THC,
[04:28.690 --> 04:32.410]  THC sativa dominant hybrids and crosses.
[04:32.410 --> 04:34.650]  I've got a male known as King Solomon,
[04:34.650 --> 04:38.770]  who puts really high THC into most of his offspring.
[04:38.770 --> 04:46.450]  I have selected very candy flavored, very distinct terpene profile rich female plants to breed with.
[04:46.450 --> 04:51.170]  A lot of what I make comes out very candy flavored, very sweet, very head buzzy.
[04:51.170 --> 04:55.970]  A lot of people have been asking for more of an indica buzz,
[04:55.970 --> 05:02.210]  more of that garlic flavor, more gassy flavors, more gassy aromas, more fuely, funky sort of shit.
[05:02.210 --> 05:06.170]  I don't particularly breed for what everybody else wants.
[05:06.170 --> 05:07.650]  I'm breeding for what I love.
[05:07.650 --> 05:08.450]  That's why it works.
[05:08.450 --> 05:09.770]  I feel like I'm kind of an artist.
[05:09.770 --> 05:11.810]  I'm making art that comes from my heart.
[05:11.810 --> 05:13.570]  It works for me.
[05:13.570 --> 05:17.050]  In turn, that makes a quality product that the market wants.
[05:17.050 --> 05:19.530]  So it sells to the consumers as well.
[05:19.530 --> 05:24.050]  I'm sure you can tell by listening to the opening of the show, all of the dabs I dab,
[05:24.050 --> 05:25.970]  I give away a lot of what I enjoy.
[05:25.970 --> 05:31.170]  I give good hints on what I enjoy at the start of the show when it comes to my dabs.
[05:31.170 --> 05:35.570]  Recently, I have been, not just recently, lately, since probably the fall,
[05:35.570 --> 05:40.490]  I've been in love with funky, gross, garlicky kind of terps.
[05:40.490 --> 05:45.770]  If it's real savory, garlicky, funky, body odory, maybe some armpits.
[05:45.770 --> 05:47.090]  I don't know.
[05:47.090 --> 05:49.410]  It's got maybe a little bit of hints of vomit in there.
[05:49.410 --> 05:52.570]  I have been in love with those types of aromas.
[05:52.610 --> 05:57.690]  And so I acquired a cut of the GMO a while back and I loved it.
[05:57.690 --> 05:58.370]  I was growing it.
[05:58.370 --> 05:59.170]  I was smoking it.
[05:59.170 --> 06:00.330]  It was amazing.
[06:00.330 --> 06:02.490]  What's the next step for a breeder to do?
[06:02.490 --> 06:04.770]  To breed with the cuts that he has acquired.
[06:04.770 --> 06:08.010]  So I took my prized King Solomon male.
[06:08.010 --> 06:09.930]  Let's talk about Solomon briefly.
[06:09.930 --> 06:13.090]  Arise is golden goat and daybreaker.
[06:13.090 --> 06:16.450]  It's a golden goat female pollinated by a daybreaker male.
[06:16.450 --> 06:22.090]  So I've got a real sweet, tropical flavored female that I pollinated with an OG Kush,
[06:22.090 --> 06:24.290]  chem dog cross of a male.
[06:24.290 --> 06:26.330]  That made my Arise.
[06:26.330 --> 06:31.410]  That Arise is very well known for putting out high THC offspring.
[06:31.410 --> 06:33.770]  There are tests near 35%.
[06:33.770 --> 06:35.810]  There's 35.84.
[06:35.810 --> 06:40.610]  There are a few other 34 and 33% THC A tests that come from Arise.
[06:40.610 --> 06:44.610]  So it very consistently puts out high THC numbers.
[06:44.610 --> 06:47.490]  I found a male in there that I call King Solomon.
[06:47.490 --> 06:48.330]  There's a lot to that.
[06:48.330 --> 06:51.170]  If you want to study King Solomon, you'll understand why.
[06:51.170 --> 06:52.770]  Solomon's got a lot of wives.
[06:52.770 --> 06:54.650]  He has bred a lot in my room.
[06:54.650 --> 06:56.530]  He has made a lot of quality offspring.
[06:56.530 --> 06:58.850]  So I know that King Solomon is a champion.
[06:58.850 --> 07:01.250]  I know he makes tremendous THC.
[07:01.250 --> 07:02.490]  I kind of call him the fixer.
[07:02.490 --> 07:05.810]  If I've got a female plant that doesn't grow the way that I would like it to grow,
[07:05.810 --> 07:07.970]  it doesn't produce the way I would like it to produce,
[07:07.970 --> 07:09.570]  pollinate it with King Solomon,
[07:09.570 --> 07:12.130]  find a phenotype that comes from there,
[07:12.130 --> 07:13.250]  it will be perfect.
[07:13.250 --> 07:15.490]  It will correct the problem and make it better.
[07:15.490 --> 07:17.170]  It'll be the original plant you had,
[07:17.170 --> 07:18.490]  plus better structure,
[07:18.490 --> 07:19.530]  faster growth,
[07:19.530 --> 07:20.450]  hyper vigor,
[07:20.450 --> 07:21.690]  and more potency.
[07:21.690 --> 07:23.970]  So Solomon is my fixer plant.
[07:23.970 --> 07:25.290]  I call him the king.
[07:25.290 --> 07:26.250]  He is the fucking king.
[07:26.250 --> 07:28.090]  I have not found a better male plant than that.
[07:28.090 --> 07:31.050]  So I took my male King Solomon plant,
[07:31.050 --> 07:33.730]  and of course I pollinated the GMO.
[07:33.730 --> 07:37.330]  Let's talk a little bit about GMO.
[07:39.250 --> 07:40.090]  GMO, I should,
[07:40.090 --> 07:43.770]  the first thing I should say is GMO does not stand for garlic,
[07:43.770 --> 07:45.050]  mushroom, onions.
[07:45.050 --> 07:48.210]  We'll talk briefly about the GMO name here.
[07:48.290 --> 07:50.890]  GMO is a chem cookies cross,
[07:50.890 --> 07:54.970]  and it was never meant to be garlic, mushroom, onions.
[07:54.970 --> 07:56.210]  It has got chem dog in it.
[07:56.210 --> 07:58.050]  It's got Girl Scout cookies in it,
[07:58.050 --> 08:00.690]  and it smells really funky.
[08:00.690 --> 08:03.010]  There is a phenotype that goes around Colorado,
[08:03.010 --> 08:04.850]  the phenotype that I bred with.
[08:04.850 --> 08:08.370]  It came from a guy known as Skunk Master Flex.
[08:08.370 --> 08:09.210]  What up Skunk?
[08:09.210 --> 08:10.050]  I hope you hear this one day,
[08:10.050 --> 08:11.770]  nothing but love and respect for you.
[08:11.770 --> 08:15.090]  Skunk called this plant the GMO
[08:15.090 --> 08:17.410]  because it smelled funky,
[08:17.410 --> 08:20.490]  and it is bred to the Girl Scout cookies.
[08:20.490 --> 08:23.530]  Now at the time that this strain became popular,
[08:23.530 --> 08:26.450]  the Girl Scouts of America were under scrutiny
[08:26.450 --> 08:27.890]  because it had been discovered
[08:27.890 --> 08:30.210]  that their Girl Scout cookies were being made
[08:30.210 --> 08:33.330]  with GMO products, and they weren't quality cookies.
[08:33.330 --> 08:35.130]  I'm not gonna even go down that route,
[08:35.130 --> 08:37.770]  but that is where the GMO came from.
[08:37.770 --> 08:39.010]  It smells crazy.
[08:39.010 --> 08:40.210]  It smells funky.
[08:40.210 --> 08:41.610]  It smells like chemicals.
[08:41.610 --> 08:44.130]  So that gives you a weird GMO vibe already.
[08:44.130 --> 08:46.250]  It's got Girl Scout cookies in it.
[08:46.290 --> 08:48.850]  So that leads us to the Girl Scout cookies
[08:48.850 --> 08:51.290]  being discovered that their product was filled
[08:51.290 --> 08:53.490]  with GMOs and non-desirable shit
[08:53.490 --> 08:54.970]  for us to put in our bodies,
[08:54.970 --> 08:57.090]  and they're selling it to us at a premium.
[08:57.090 --> 09:00.610]  So it was the GMO in the Girl Scout cookies
[09:00.610 --> 09:03.450]  is what sparked the idea to call it GMO.
[09:03.450 --> 09:05.370]  It is not garlic mushroom onions.
[09:05.370 --> 09:08.170]  It may smell like garlic mushroom onions to some people.
[09:08.170 --> 09:10.770]  I had a concentrate of it that smelled like mushrooms
[09:10.770 --> 09:11.610]  and Swiss cheese.
[09:11.610 --> 09:15.650]  It absolutely did, but that is not why that name came about.
[09:15.650 --> 09:17.930]  So I wanna dispel that myth, that rumor.
[09:17.930 --> 09:20.810]  I wanna put Skunk Master's real story out there.
[09:20.810 --> 09:24.130]  He called it GMO because it's got Girl Scout cookies in it.
[09:24.130 --> 09:25.650]  It smells like chemicals,
[09:25.650 --> 09:27.690]  and the Girl Scouts were under scrutiny
[09:27.690 --> 09:29.450]  for being discovered that their product
[09:29.450 --> 09:30.930]  was laden with GMO.
[09:30.930 --> 09:33.770]  So that's where the GMO name came from.
[09:33.770 --> 09:36.930]  Let's talk more about the plant a little bit now.
[09:36.930 --> 09:39.570]  The plant grows really tall and lanky.
[09:39.570 --> 09:41.210]  It is kind of a problematic plant.
[09:41.210 --> 09:43.170]  It is a pain in the ass of a plant.
[09:43.170 --> 09:44.410]  It would not do,
[09:44.410 --> 09:46.290]  it will work in a commercial environment,
[09:46.290 --> 09:49.210]  but it is not going to be the one that makes the boss happy,
[09:49.210 --> 09:50.330]  and it's not gonna be the one
[09:50.330 --> 09:52.510]  that gets the grower a bonus check.
[09:52.510 --> 09:56.290]  It does make big giant buds, but it grows very slowly.
[09:56.290 --> 09:58.690]  It's kind of lanky, it's kind of stretchy,
[09:58.690 --> 09:59.770]  and it has issues.
[09:59.770 --> 10:01.570]  It likes to get cow mag deficient.
[10:01.570 --> 10:03.490]  It's got some other problems to it.
[10:03.490 --> 10:04.810]  It's kind of a finicky little bitch.
[10:04.810 --> 10:05.690]  If you don't feed it right,
[10:05.690 --> 10:07.570]  it doesn't give you what you can get.
[10:07.570 --> 10:11.290]  So I took the GMO female,
[10:11.290 --> 10:14.050]  and of course I pollinated that with King Solomon.
[10:14.690 --> 10:15.570]  What was my goal?
[10:15.570 --> 10:18.170]  My goal was to get those garlic turps.
[10:18.170 --> 10:21.410]  I love that savory, it's like mashed potatoes
[10:21.410 --> 10:23.250]  with garlic, garlic mashed potatoes,
[10:23.250 --> 10:25.970]  or it's almost like you're dabbing or smoking
[10:25.970 --> 10:28.050]  a savory Thanksgiving meal.
[10:28.050 --> 10:29.890]  I wanted that garlic turp,
[10:29.890 --> 10:33.450]  but I wanted a better plant structure
[10:33.450 --> 10:35.330]  and a shorter flowering time.
[10:35.330 --> 10:37.730]  The GMO takes a little bit too long to flower.
[10:37.730 --> 10:39.570]  The buds aren't very big.
[10:39.570 --> 10:41.250]  It's super potent and super tasty,
[10:41.250 --> 10:43.930]  and it's very effective, but it could be better.
[10:44.770 --> 10:45.970]  So my goal was just to improve it,
[10:45.970 --> 10:49.010]  keep that turp, but improve on that lanky, shitty structure,
[10:49.010 --> 10:50.530]  and improve on the flowering time,
[10:50.530 --> 10:53.290]  and also improve on the harvest weight,
[10:53.290 --> 10:55.690]  because it does not put out big, fat buds.
[10:55.690 --> 11:00.690]  So of course I pollinated the GMO with King Solomon,
[11:00.690 --> 11:02.810]  and now we've got Dark Hollow.
[11:03.730 --> 11:04.730]  I'm gonna skip a few things,
[11:04.730 --> 11:07.930]  and I wanna tell you why I call it Dark Hollow.
[11:07.930 --> 11:10.290]  Dark Hollow, of course, is a Grateful Dead song.
[11:10.290 --> 11:12.730]  It's one of my favorite Grateful Dead songs,
[11:12.730 --> 11:15.690]  one of my favorite versions is off of Bear's Choice,
[11:15.690 --> 11:17.490]  Best of the Grateful Dead, Volume 2.
[11:17.490 --> 11:18.570]  It's an acoustic version.
[11:18.570 --> 11:19.930]  I know that's a lot of weird info
[11:19.930 --> 11:21.490]  you probably don't care about.
[11:21.490 --> 11:22.410]  Maybe you do.
[11:22.410 --> 11:23.330]  If you're interested in that,
[11:23.330 --> 11:24.970]  I want you to be able to find it.
[11:24.970 --> 11:26.770]  Dark Hollow by the Grateful Dead.
[11:26.770 --> 11:29.690]  Another really good version of that song is on Reckoning,
[11:29.690 --> 11:31.530]  another live album they put out.
[11:31.530 --> 11:34.590]  Anyway, that's where the name came from, Dark Hollow.
[11:35.450 --> 11:38.010]  It makes big, dark leaves.
[11:38.010 --> 11:39.570]  There's a phenotype that will make
[11:39.570 --> 11:41.810]  nearly black, purple leaves,
[11:41.810 --> 11:43.810]  and they start to get this weird velvety texture
[11:43.810 --> 11:45.490]  toward the end when you start flushing.
[11:45.490 --> 11:49.190]  So the dark colored leaves, it had that dark flavor to it,
[11:49.190 --> 11:52.450]  savory flavors, Dark Hollow, it stuck for me.
[11:52.450 --> 11:55.330]  I am going to do a full episode on how I name strains,
[11:55.330 --> 11:57.330]  but right now, I just wanna give you an idea.
[11:57.330 --> 11:58.250]  The Grateful Dead song,
[11:58.250 --> 11:59.530]  the Grateful Dead means a lot to me.
[11:59.530 --> 12:01.450]  I love their music, they just feel good.
[12:01.450 --> 12:04.850]  So Dark Hollow, the song name, the leaf color,
[12:04.850 --> 12:06.770]  it all worked out for us with the flavor.
[12:06.770 --> 12:07.650]  That's how I got the name.
[12:07.650 --> 12:11.150]  It makes big, fat, dark colored leaves, Dark Hollow.
[12:11.190 --> 12:15.190]  So let's talk about some of the aromas and flavors
[12:15.190 --> 12:16.950]  that you will get from Dark Hollow.
[12:16.950 --> 12:18.870]  I keep saying garlic.
[12:18.870 --> 12:22.510]  The garlic aromas come through very well.
[12:22.510 --> 12:26.790]  There are also hints of rubber, like car tires.
[12:26.790 --> 12:30.410]  There are also hints of, if you've ever popped open
[12:30.410 --> 12:32.830]  a fresh jar of tennis balls,
[12:32.830 --> 12:35.430]  that's kinda what it smells like, fresh tennis balls.
[12:35.430 --> 12:38.190]  Or sometimes it smells like new shoes.
[12:38.190 --> 12:39.870]  If you ever get a brand new pair of Nikes
[12:39.870 --> 12:40.910]  and you open up the Nikes,
[12:40.910 --> 12:43.790]  that leather and rubber smell kinda comes out.
[12:43.790 --> 12:46.070]  It's sorta got that sort of a smell to it.
[12:46.070 --> 12:48.750]  It's also got gassy aromas.
[12:48.750 --> 12:52.630]  There are gassy, gassy aromas in some of these phenotypes.
[12:52.630 --> 12:57.350]  There is one phenotype that makes a disgustingly amazing
[12:57.350 --> 13:00.410]  sour vomit aroma, and I love it.
[13:00.410 --> 13:02.150]  I cannot get enough of that phenotype.
[13:02.150 --> 13:06.110]  I know that sounds terrible, but it's like, that's gross.
[13:06.110 --> 13:07.230]  Ooh, I love it.
[13:07.230 --> 13:08.630]  That's so gross.
[13:08.630 --> 13:09.710]  Let me smell it again.
[13:09.710 --> 13:11.630]  It's just so disgustingly pleasant
[13:11.630 --> 13:13.190]  that I cannot stop smelling it.
[13:13.190 --> 13:15.430]  So it's real savory.
[13:15.430 --> 13:18.270]  I say bottom end, lower sorta notes of smells,
[13:18.270 --> 13:20.430]  not the high, sharper stuff, lower stuff.
[13:20.430 --> 13:24.710]  Real savory, garlic, gas, rubber, tires.
[13:24.710 --> 13:27.130]  Stabby says it smells like leather boots.
[13:27.130 --> 13:29.830]  So I will agree with that because of the shoe factor.
[13:29.830 --> 13:32.630]  It kinda smells like a pair of fresh leather Nikes.
[13:32.630 --> 13:34.230]  It's got that rubber, got the leather,
[13:34.230 --> 13:36.030]  like you just opened up a fresh pair of Jordans
[13:36.030 --> 13:37.790]  or you're walking through the Nike store.
[13:37.790 --> 13:40.230]  It kinda does have that sort of aroma.
[13:40.230 --> 13:42.310]  Now let's talk about the buzz.
[13:42.310 --> 13:46.430]  I call Dark Hollow deep thinking weed.
[13:46.430 --> 13:49.330]  Most of what I breed puts me,
[13:49.330 --> 13:52.870]  I purposefully love to smoke myself into a panic attack.
[13:52.870 --> 13:54.430]  I wanna smoke right at the edge
[13:54.430 --> 13:56.250]  to where I'm like, I don't know what's going on, man.
[13:56.250 --> 13:59.210]  I wanna smoke right to giggles, right to that point.
[14:00.070 --> 14:04.710]  The Dark Hollow, I can smoke myself into the couch.
[14:04.710 --> 14:06.410]  I usually don't breed things
[14:06.410 --> 14:07.890]  that make me go into the couch.
[14:07.890 --> 14:11.650]  This one, I can turn off my entire body and go numb.
[14:11.650 --> 14:14.690]  I can get into a little bubble and I can just think.
[14:14.690 --> 14:17.410]  And I just end up, it's meditation weed.
[14:17.410 --> 14:19.330]  You're just, nothing's going on around you.
[14:19.330 --> 14:21.650]  You could burn down the entire house.
[14:21.650 --> 14:23.410]  You could move all the furniture out.
[14:23.410 --> 14:25.470]  As long as you don't touch the couch I'm sitting on,
[14:25.470 --> 14:28.130]  I'll never notice if I've smoked enough Dark Hollow.
[14:28.130 --> 14:31.530]  It puts me in this little, just a bubble.
[14:31.530 --> 14:34.770]  I call it thinker weed or bubble weed or meditation weed.
[14:35.250 --> 14:37.450]  It just feels like you're just isolated in a good way.
[14:37.450 --> 14:38.690]  It's not a scary way.
[14:38.690 --> 14:40.890]  It just shuts everything off around you.
[14:40.890 --> 14:42.130]  So if you're one of those people
[14:42.130 --> 14:44.370]  that has a hard time shutting things down,
[14:44.370 --> 14:45.890]  this may be good weed for you.
[14:45.890 --> 14:48.210]  If you need to go to class and kinda be able
[14:48.210 --> 14:50.450]  to just shut everything off and pay attention
[14:50.450 --> 14:52.570]  to the professor and just take notes and learn,
[14:52.570 --> 14:54.530]  this may be the shit for you.
[14:54.530 --> 14:55.970]  It's not multitask weed.
[14:55.970 --> 14:59.730]  It's not fucking do the dishes and listen to music weed.
[14:59.730 --> 15:02.730]  This is lock in and fucking be in your brain kind of weed.
[15:02.730 --> 15:04.450]  So it tastes real good.
[15:05.130 --> 15:06.130]  It's got a real nice buzz to it.
[15:06.130 --> 15:08.170]  Now let's talk about, this is a grow podcast,
[15:08.170 --> 15:11.170]  so let's talk a little bit about growing Dark Hollow.
[15:11.170 --> 15:12.610]  That's my favorite part is growing.
[15:12.610 --> 15:13.650]  I don't know, that's a tough choice.
[15:13.650 --> 15:15.690]  Do I prefer to grow it or smoke it?
[15:15.690 --> 15:17.170]  Ah, I don't wanna make that decision.
[15:17.170 --> 15:18.050]  We'll keep moving.
[15:18.050 --> 15:19.290]  Shout out to our friends at Green Dot
[15:19.290 --> 15:20.290]  for the Halo Concentrate.
[15:20.290 --> 15:22.210]  Got me thinking down that path.
[15:22.210 --> 15:23.050]  You tell me.
[15:23.050 --> 15:24.030]  If you had to make a decision,
[15:24.030 --> 15:25.650]  you can either grow weed or smoke weed
[15:25.650 --> 15:27.050]  for the rest of your life, but only one.
[15:27.050 --> 15:28.010]  Which one are you picking?
[15:28.010 --> 15:31.290]  Send me a tweet at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[15:31.290 --> 15:33.810]  Now let's talk about growing these plants.
[15:33.810 --> 15:36.690]  I keep saying it in most of my strain descriptions,
[15:36.690 --> 15:39.130]  but these plants will get tall.
[15:39.130 --> 15:41.010]  They're going to get tall on you.
[15:41.930 --> 15:44.850]  The GMO plant is known for being very tall.
[15:44.850 --> 15:46.650]  It's got that chem dog kind of a structure.
[15:46.650 --> 15:48.690]  It's got that cookies kind of a structure.
[15:48.690 --> 15:50.810]  It gets real long and lacy.
[15:50.810 --> 15:53.290]  It'll grow rope vines on you if you let it.
[15:53.290 --> 15:55.170]  So you've gotta keep it a lot of light
[15:55.170 --> 15:56.730]  to keep it nice and compact.
[15:56.730 --> 15:58.730]  I do a lot of cracking of the stems.
[15:58.730 --> 16:00.650]  I talk about popping stems a lot.
[16:00.650 --> 16:03.610]  I grab the stem with a couple of fingers in one spot,
[16:04.370 --> 16:06.010]  I grab the stem with a couple of fingers in my thumb,
[16:06.010 --> 16:07.450]  I grab right above it with a couple of fingers in my thumb,
[16:07.450 --> 16:09.370]  and I simply twist in different directions
[16:09.370 --> 16:12.770]  until you hear a little pop, just a little snapping sound.
[16:12.770 --> 16:15.330]  You've now broken the cellulose structure of the plant.
[16:15.330 --> 16:17.670]  Instead of that plant growing vertically straight up,
[16:17.670 --> 16:19.250]  it's gonna send some energy to healing
[16:19.250 --> 16:20.770]  that broken part of the plant.
[16:20.770 --> 16:22.650]  It won't get taller, it will get thicker.
[16:22.650 --> 16:25.210]  We like them nice and thick, we want them nice and wide.
[16:25.210 --> 16:26.570]  So go ahead and crack those stems
[16:26.570 --> 16:29.170]  because they're going to get very tall.
[16:29.170 --> 16:32.810]  There will also be plenty of distance between your nodes.
[16:32.810 --> 16:35.890]  For some reason, this cross likes to put some distance
[16:35.890 --> 16:36.790]  between the nodes.
[16:36.790 --> 16:39.290]  If you give it plenty of light, you'll minimize that,
[16:39.290 --> 16:41.650]  but it will get some space between the nodes.
[16:41.650 --> 16:45.570]  That does allow a lot of very easy trellis work.
[16:45.570 --> 16:47.290]  If you're a person that does trellising,
[16:47.290 --> 16:49.850]  this plant will weave into the trellis very easily
[16:49.850 --> 16:52.110]  because of those long branches.
[16:52.110 --> 16:55.370]  Let me keep myself on track talking more about the growing.
[16:55.370 --> 16:58.650]  It's gonna get tall, it will do the 21-day stretch on you.
[16:58.650 --> 17:01.550]  It is probably going to get really tall during that,
[17:01.550 --> 17:03.550]  then the stretch slows down,
[17:03.550 --> 17:05.150]  and all that part where it's stretched
[17:05.150 --> 17:08.630]  fills in with big, fat, thick, chunky buds.
[17:08.630 --> 17:11.570]  This will make just giant, chunky colas
[17:11.570 --> 17:12.630]  the whole way through,
[17:12.630 --> 17:14.790]  but it looks like you're gonna get big, stretchy plants
[17:14.790 --> 17:16.930]  at first, just give them time to fill in.
[17:16.930 --> 17:20.070]  And like I keep saying, it wants a lot of light,
[17:20.070 --> 17:21.230]  a lot of light.
[17:21.230 --> 17:23.710]  These plants really seem to like a lot of light.
[17:23.710 --> 17:27.230]  So you're going to get some big leaves
[17:27.230 --> 17:28.590]  on some of these plants.
[17:28.590 --> 17:31.270]  You may get some big, giant black leaves,
[17:31.950 --> 17:34.870]  big, giant bright green leaves, big, giant purple leaves.
[17:34.870 --> 17:36.650]  Later in the flowering phase,
[17:36.650 --> 17:39.850]  they may start to turn like a champagne pink sort of a color
[17:39.850 --> 17:40.830]  as they fade out.
[17:40.830 --> 17:41.830]  That is a good thing.
[17:41.830 --> 17:43.570]  There is no problem there.
[17:43.570 --> 17:44.910]  That's what you want.
[17:44.910 --> 17:49.910]  Also, some of the larger leaf phenotypes may be droopy.
[17:50.850 --> 17:52.470]  That is not a problem.
[17:52.470 --> 17:55.950]  The Daybreaker grandparent on the Arise side
[17:55.950 --> 17:58.510]  had very large leaves.
[17:58.510 --> 18:01.030]  Sometimes that male would droop.
[18:01.790 --> 18:02.630]  He wasn't thirsty.
[18:02.630 --> 18:03.870]  He hadn't met his DLI.
[18:03.870 --> 18:05.430]  He just had such big leaves
[18:05.430 --> 18:07.230]  that sometimes they would just hang down.
[18:07.230 --> 18:09.110]  Like he was like, bro, these leaves are huge.
[18:09.110 --> 18:10.590]  I'm not holding them up all day.
[18:10.590 --> 18:12.550]  I'm just gonna kind of let them droop a little bit.
[18:12.550 --> 18:15.430]  If you see these plants drooping a little bit
[18:15.430 --> 18:17.350]  and you know that your water is fine,
[18:17.350 --> 18:20.310]  you know that your DLI is up to speed, don't stress.
[18:20.310 --> 18:22.630]  That is a trait of these plants
[18:22.630 --> 18:24.830]  that comes from the Daybreaker grandparent.
[18:24.830 --> 18:27.910]  I think it comes from the Joseph O.G. grandpa
[18:27.910 --> 18:29.070]  to tell you the truth.
[18:29.070 --> 18:31.510]  So if you see some droopy leaves
[18:31.510 --> 18:34.490]  and you know you have watered, that is okay.
[18:34.490 --> 18:37.750]  You may see some really long petioles.
[18:37.750 --> 18:40.430]  The leaves will stick really far off of the plant.
[18:40.430 --> 18:41.270]  That is okay.
[18:41.270 --> 18:42.970]  Many people think that's a problem.
[18:42.970 --> 18:44.910]  That is a trait coming from the Daybreaker,
[18:44.910 --> 18:46.470]  also the Girl Scout cookies.
[18:46.470 --> 18:48.950]  So long petioles is to be expected.
[18:48.950 --> 18:51.230]  Purple petioles are not a problem.
[18:51.230 --> 18:53.350]  You may see some purpling in this plant.
[18:53.350 --> 18:54.910]  That's not a nutrient deficiency.
[18:54.910 --> 18:56.590]  That is not a cold issue.
[18:56.590 --> 18:58.330]  That is what this plant does.
[18:58.330 --> 19:00.170]  It will make colors like that.
[19:00.170 --> 19:02.130]  So you're gonna see long purple petioles
[19:02.130 --> 19:04.130]  and big colorful leaves.
[19:04.130 --> 19:06.290]  You're gonna get long branching,
[19:06.290 --> 19:08.750]  a lot of long, long branching.
[19:08.750 --> 19:11.630]  Not many side shoots, but really long branches.
[19:11.630 --> 19:14.330]  It's gonna grow kind of like O.G. Kush, you guys.
[19:14.330 --> 19:16.190]  If you're familiar with growing O.G.,
[19:16.190 --> 19:18.010]  it just gets long and switchy,
[19:18.010 --> 19:19.370]  but then once you put it into flower,
[19:19.370 --> 19:22.690]  that long switchy shit will fill in with nothing but colas.
[19:22.690 --> 19:24.730]  So be ready for kind of stretchy,
[19:24.730 --> 19:26.210]  long, pain in the ass plants.
[19:26.210 --> 19:28.430]  This is not going to be the easiest plant to grow,
[19:28.430 --> 19:31.450]  but in the end, it will be well worth all of the work.
[19:31.450 --> 19:34.010]  I keep saying it grows kind of like O.G. Kush.
[19:34.010 --> 19:36.010]  Anyone who's familiar with O.G.
[19:36.010 --> 19:39.950]  knows that these plants will need extra cow mag.
[19:39.950 --> 19:41.930]  Cookies often needs more cow mag.
[19:41.930 --> 19:43.730]  O.G. needs more cow mag.
[19:43.730 --> 19:46.290]  Be on top of the cow mag for this plant.
[19:46.290 --> 19:48.290]  If you see the little spots forming
[19:48.290 --> 19:49.490]  in the middle of the leaves,
[19:49.490 --> 19:52.250]  that is probably, unless it's spider mites, pay attention,
[19:52.250 --> 19:54.690]  that is probably your earliest sign of cow mag.
[19:54.690 --> 19:58.450]  Cow mag is going to be the most common deficiency
[19:58.450 --> 20:00.370]  with these plants.
[20:00.370 --> 20:01.210]  They're gonna get tall.
[20:01.210 --> 20:02.310]  They're gonna get kind of stretchy.
[20:02.310 --> 20:04.250]  They're gonna double in size.
[20:04.250 --> 20:05.630]  You will need supports.
[20:05.630 --> 20:07.290]  You will need some sort of sticks,
[20:07.290 --> 20:09.490]  tomato cages, or trellises.
[20:09.490 --> 20:11.210]  I like to grow these plants with sticks.
[20:11.210 --> 20:13.210]  A lot of the times I do trellis and tomato cages.
[20:13.210 --> 20:14.850]  I prefer sticks with these plants
[20:14.850 --> 20:16.290]  because of the way they grow.
[20:17.250 --> 20:19.930]  Top it one time, you'll get four big tops.
[20:19.930 --> 20:22.290]  Use those four big tops, put sticks in there.
[20:22.290 --> 20:24.030]  Then you can kind of put them in the room
[20:24.370 --> 20:25.510]  and get real close together.
[20:25.510 --> 20:26.870]  That's the way I do it with this plant.
[20:26.870 --> 20:30.350]  I don't do the cages with the dark hollow.
[20:30.350 --> 20:31.790]  I prefer sticks.
[20:31.790 --> 20:33.430]  If you're gonna trellis, trellis it early
[20:33.430 --> 20:35.430]  because it does get stiff and woody.
[20:35.430 --> 20:37.430]  I've noticed that these phenotypes,
[20:37.430 --> 20:39.710]  something in the genetics that tends to get stiff
[20:39.710 --> 20:41.590]  and hard toward the end of life,
[20:41.590 --> 20:43.150]  it won't be really easy to work.
[20:43.150 --> 20:46.070]  So I wrote it again, cow mag.
[20:46.070 --> 20:49.270]  I must really mean cow mag.
[20:49.270 --> 20:51.830]  These plants are gonna want extra cow mag.
[20:51.830 --> 20:54.790]  You're going to notice a couple of different,
[20:54.790 --> 20:57.670]  very distinct phenotypes.
[20:57.670 --> 21:01.410]  There will be a black leafed phenotype.
[21:01.410 --> 21:04.250]  The black leaf phenotype, you'll notice it early in flower.
[21:04.250 --> 21:06.750]  About week four or five, it'll start turning darker on you.
[21:06.750 --> 21:08.610]  The petioles will get black.
[21:08.610 --> 21:12.990]  The black leafed phenotype has a tendency to look angry.
[21:12.990 --> 21:14.830]  Later in flower, this is a trait
[21:14.830 --> 21:16.010]  from the Girl Scout cookies.
[21:16.010 --> 21:18.910]  Late in flower, the leaves will go really dark in color
[21:18.910 --> 21:21.790]  and maybe they'll just start doing weird claw shapes
[21:21.790 --> 21:24.190]  or the leaves will start doing weird shit to you.
[21:24.190 --> 21:26.190]  That is a trait from the Girl Scout cookies
[21:26.190 --> 21:27.350]  and it just happens.
[21:27.350 --> 21:30.070]  I cannot keep that plant happy all the way to the end
[21:30.070 --> 21:32.230]  no matter what I have done.
[21:32.230 --> 21:36.270]  I've noticed the blacker leafed phenotype prefers
[21:36.270 --> 21:38.990]  lower pH and cooler temps.
[21:38.990 --> 21:41.630]  So if you've got that dark colored phenotype,
[21:41.630 --> 21:44.230]  lower your temperatures, lower your pH,
[21:44.230 --> 21:46.590]  it may make that plant a little bit happier.
[21:46.590 --> 21:50.510]  If you have got the green leaf dominant phenotype,
[21:50.510 --> 21:51.910]  and you'll be able to tell you guys,
[21:51.910 --> 21:54.950]  this plant makes really dark and really light phenotypes
[21:54.950 --> 21:56.430]  and it indicates early.
[21:56.430 --> 21:59.470]  That lighter green colored phenotype
[21:59.470 --> 22:01.810]  is going to like your standard temperatures
[22:01.810 --> 22:03.630]  and your standard pH.
[22:03.630 --> 22:07.430]  When I say standard, I'm talking like 77 to 82, 84,
[22:07.430 --> 22:09.090]  whatever you guys are doing in the grow
[22:09.090 --> 22:13.070]  and your standard pH, like 59 to 64 or whatever.
[22:13.070 --> 22:16.070]  But when it comes to the darker leafed phenotype,
[22:16.070 --> 22:18.710]  you're gonna wanna get like 72, 74 degrees.
[22:18.710 --> 22:20.230]  It can take a little bit colder.
[22:20.950 --> 22:22.670]  It can certainly take a colder night temperature.
[22:22.670 --> 22:25.630]  And you wanna drop that pH down to like 662
[22:25.630 --> 22:28.070]  and stay there with the dark leaf phenotype.
[22:28.070 --> 22:31.790]  Of course, I'm giving you advice based on my experience.
[22:31.790 --> 22:36.030]  Your room, your nutrients, your equipment, your plants,
[22:36.030 --> 22:37.830]  everything is going to have a variable.
[22:37.830 --> 22:40.250]  Your style will play a factor into this.
[22:40.250 --> 22:43.090]  So anything I say is from my experience,
[22:43.090 --> 22:44.670]  what I've seen through testers,
[22:44.670 --> 22:48.150]  what I've seen in my rooms, your experience may vary.
[22:48.150 --> 22:51.550]  Listen to the plants, the plants are the boss.
[22:51.550 --> 22:53.310]  You may wanna give them more CalMac.
[22:53.310 --> 22:56.650]  You may have a schedule that says this is going to happen.
[22:56.650 --> 22:57.490]  Who cares?
[22:57.490 --> 23:00.290]  If the plants say, don't do this, don't do that.
[23:00.290 --> 23:03.430]  If the plants say, please do this, please do that.
[23:03.430 --> 23:06.150]  We need to have a good strategy.
[23:06.150 --> 23:07.790]  We need to be in control,
[23:07.790 --> 23:11.250]  but we also need to be open to suggestions from the plants.
[23:11.250 --> 23:12.190]  The plants are the boss.
[23:12.190 --> 23:14.950]  Our goal is to make quality product in the end.
[23:14.950 --> 23:16.470]  And if we don't pay attention to the plants,
[23:16.470 --> 23:18.190]  we don't have quality product in the end.
[23:18.190 --> 23:21.350]  So take everything I say very seriously,
[23:21.350 --> 23:25.490]  but also know that your room, your plants, your phenotypes,
[23:25.490 --> 23:27.110]  everything are going to play a factor
[23:27.110 --> 23:29.230]  and you may have different experiences.
[23:29.230 --> 23:30.830]  So pay attention to the plants.
[23:30.830 --> 23:32.710]  But from what I've noticed,
[23:32.710 --> 23:35.070]  those green, the bright green phenotypes
[23:35.070 --> 23:38.630]  like a little higher temp and a little higher pH.
[23:38.630 --> 23:40.310]  Of course, the darker colored plants
[23:40.310 --> 23:44.630]  like the cooler temperature and the lowered pH.
[23:44.630 --> 23:45.850]  What else can we talk about?
[23:46.530 --> 23:47.690]  A few more notes here.
[23:47.690 --> 23:50.010]  Oh, harvest times.
[23:50.010 --> 23:52.890]  The darker colored plants,
[23:52.890 --> 23:54.930]  they will take less time
[23:54.930 --> 23:58.170]  than the bright green colored plants.
[23:58.170 --> 24:00.410]  I say that the dark hollow
[24:00.410 --> 24:02.850]  takes somewhere between nine and 11 weeks.
[24:02.850 --> 24:04.330]  I mostly say nine to 10 weeks.
[24:04.330 --> 24:05.450]  There will be outliers.
[24:05.450 --> 24:07.450]  You'll find an eight week phenotype.
[24:07.450 --> 24:11.250]  You may find one that grows really black leaves,
[24:11.250 --> 24:14.330]  really wide black leaves with purple petioles.
[24:14.330 --> 24:16.410]  And it makes really dark buds.
[24:16.410 --> 24:19.170]  That is almost a copy of the Girl Scout cookies.
[24:19.170 --> 24:21.810]  That one finishes in the end of week eight.
[24:21.810 --> 24:25.450]  56, 55 days, she's ready to chop down and smoke.
[24:25.450 --> 24:26.370]  She's ready to go.
[24:26.370 --> 24:29.150]  So you may find that eight week phenotype.
[24:29.150 --> 24:32.250]  The nine week phenotype is a beautiful combination.
[24:32.250 --> 24:36.290]  It's got that cookies, aroma and flavor and funk and stink.
[24:36.290 --> 24:38.070]  It's also got the garlic in there.
[24:38.070 --> 24:39.570]  It's got just enough darkness
[24:39.570 --> 24:42.110]  to give it some really beautiful colors on the buds.
[24:42.110 --> 24:44.670]  And it doesn't take 10 or 11 weeks to finish.
[24:44.670 --> 24:46.590]  You'll find another phenotype in there
[24:46.590 --> 24:48.610]  that is very bright green.
[24:48.610 --> 24:50.670]  I think this one is kind of,
[24:50.670 --> 24:52.190]  it's more like the 50 50 mix.
[24:52.190 --> 24:53.590]  It's got the arise in there.
[24:53.590 --> 24:55.430]  It's got the GMO in there.
[24:55.430 --> 24:57.710]  It's got a sweet garlicky thing to it,
[24:57.710 --> 25:00.790]  but that one's gonna take you a little bit longer to flower.
[25:00.790 --> 25:04.030]  So we've got our Girl Scout cookies dominant phenotype.
[25:04.030 --> 25:06.350]  We've got the one that I think is kind of a 50 50.
[25:06.350 --> 25:08.110]  That one's gonna take about 10 and a half weeks
[25:08.110 --> 25:09.550]  to flower probably.
[25:09.550 --> 25:11.910]  Then we have got our, the Dark Hollow
[25:11.910 --> 25:15.470]  that it looked like JR token nailed this phenotype.
[25:15.470 --> 25:17.470]  You can see it was bright green,
[25:17.470 --> 25:19.630]  but right where the leaves are sticking out of the buds,
[25:19.630 --> 25:20.850]  they were starting to turn purple.
[25:20.850 --> 25:23.170]  You can see the sugar leaves were turning purple
[25:23.170 --> 25:24.950]  as they were coming out of the buds.
[25:24.950 --> 25:28.470]  I think he took that one nine weeks and it looks perfect.
[25:28.470 --> 25:31.110]  You guys, it looks like a giant menorah of buds
[25:31.110 --> 25:32.190]  when he hung it upside down.
[25:32.190 --> 25:35.870]  It was nothing but bud from the base all the way to the tip.
[25:35.870 --> 25:37.710]  Big, fat, chunky buds.
[25:37.710 --> 25:40.030]  I'm pretty sure he took that one nine full weeks.
[25:40.030 --> 25:41.670]  Big shout out to JR token.
[25:41.670 --> 25:43.990]  You can see his photos on Cannabuzz,
[25:43.990 --> 25:45.350]  shameless plug for Cannabuzz.
[25:45.350 --> 25:48.470]  It's a cannabis friendly social media application
[25:48.470 --> 25:51.350]  where you can post your cannabis photography.
[25:51.350 --> 25:55.110]  Check out Cannabuzz on your iPhone or your Android device.
[25:55.110 --> 25:55.950]  I'm gonna take a sip here
[25:55.950 --> 25:57.990]  and get my voice and myself back on track.
[26:03.640 --> 26:06.200]  All right, so we've got a few distinct phenotypes
[26:06.200 --> 26:07.040]  to look for.
[26:07.040 --> 26:08.640]  We've got the Girl Scout cookies looking phenotype
[26:08.640 --> 26:10.360]  that wraps up around week eight.
[26:10.360 --> 26:13.200]  We've got that sort of 50-50 looking phenotype
[26:13.200 --> 26:14.560]  that's gonna take a little bit longer,
[26:14.560 --> 26:16.480]  10 and a half, maybe 11 weeks.
[26:16.480 --> 26:19.480]  Then we've got that beautiful phenotype that gets dark.
[26:19.480 --> 26:20.920]  It makes purple leaves.
[26:20.920 --> 26:23.800]  It grows really big, big, fat, chunky colas.
[26:23.800 --> 26:26.000]  It smells like garlic and sweetness
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.200]  and a little bit of gas and some dirty feet.
[26:28.200 --> 26:29.840]  That is your nine week phenotype.
[26:29.840 --> 26:32.060]  That's the one you were looking for.
[26:32.060 --> 26:34.600]  You'll start seeing the greener buds
[26:34.600 --> 26:36.640]  start making purple leaves around the edges
[26:36.640 --> 26:37.640]  when you flush it.
[26:37.640 --> 26:39.920]  Those purpler leaves start turning gold.
[26:39.920 --> 26:41.760]  That is a beautiful phenotype.
[26:41.760 --> 26:43.480]  I really love that one.
[26:43.480 --> 26:46.000]  I wanna talk about some of the aromas.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.840]  The phenotype that smells like rubber early on
[26:49.840 --> 26:52.760]  turns to gas once you dry and cure it.
[26:52.760 --> 26:53.800]  That's what I have noticed.
[26:53.800 --> 26:57.040]  The rubbery tennis balls, fresh Nikes,
[26:57.040 --> 27:00.000]  when you cut that one down, trim it, dry it, and cure it,
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.640]  it tends to turn very garlic.
[27:02.640 --> 27:04.320]  That is when the garlic appears,
[27:04.320 --> 27:05.800]  is later in the dry and cure.
[27:05.800 --> 27:08.480]  And then when you extract that, if you make a squish,
[27:08.520 --> 27:12.600]  that's when the garlic really, really comes out of that one.
[27:12.600 --> 27:16.000]  There is a phenotype that smells sour.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.600]  It's got a gross, sour smell to it.
[27:18.600 --> 27:21.280]  I think it's a longer flowering phenotype.
[27:21.280 --> 27:23.040]  This one, I didn't find this phenotype.
[27:23.040 --> 27:24.920]  This one was presented to me.
[27:24.920 --> 27:27.000]  It smelled sour and gross.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.800]  This is the one that I kinda say smells like a bar trash can
[27:29.800 --> 27:31.400]  or a little bit of vomit.
[27:31.400 --> 27:33.840]  It had, when I smoked a bowl of this one,
[27:33.840 --> 27:36.760]  it had the most intense eye buzz.
[27:37.760 --> 27:39.160]  I don't know how else to explain it
[27:39.160 --> 27:42.200]  other than my eyes got really heavy and kind of vibratey
[27:42.200 --> 27:43.760]  and bloodshot red.
[27:43.760 --> 27:46.560]  It went straight to my eyes.
[27:46.560 --> 27:50.560]  So if you get the phenotype that smells acrid and sour
[27:50.560 --> 27:54.200]  and has a little bit skinnier, longer, super serrated leaf,
[27:54.200 --> 27:57.800]  that one is going to be a crazy eye buzzer.
[27:57.800 --> 28:00.880]  It was really intense on the eyes, straight to the head.
[28:00.880 --> 28:02.880]  I felt like I just wanted to stare at the floor.
[28:02.880 --> 28:06.080]  I was so high, I felt like my eyes wanted to water.
[28:07.600 --> 28:09.640]  Couple more notes that I've said.
[28:09.640 --> 28:11.640]  Leaf droop, I've talked about the leaf droop.
[28:11.640 --> 28:13.080]  I don't want you guys to freak out
[28:13.080 --> 28:14.360]  when the leaves get droopy.
[28:14.360 --> 28:17.240]  That is a trait that comes from the daybreaker male.
[28:17.240 --> 28:18.080]  I've said this before.
[28:18.080 --> 28:21.800]  A lot of the crosses, more of the indica dominant stuff
[28:21.800 --> 28:25.360]  that comes from the daybreaker will get these droopy leaves.
[28:25.360 --> 28:27.040]  It is not a problem with your plants.
[28:27.040 --> 28:28.280]  It's not a problem with the room.
[28:28.280 --> 28:29.640]  It's not a problem with the water.
[28:29.640 --> 28:30.880]  It's not your fault.
[28:30.880 --> 28:33.000]  That's what these plants do.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.400]  Pay attention, make sure she's not too dry.
[28:35.440 --> 28:37.120]  As long as it's not too dry,
[28:37.120 --> 28:39.320]  that's just what the plant does.
[28:39.320 --> 28:41.560]  Also, when the plants have reached their DLI,
[28:41.560 --> 28:43.360]  when they've had enough light for the day,
[28:43.360 --> 28:44.360]  they will droop.
[28:44.360 --> 28:46.240]  Just to show you, I've had enough light.
[28:46.240 --> 28:48.960]  I'm not going to photosynthesize anymore today.
[28:48.960 --> 28:49.920]  I'm going to take a little break.
[28:49.920 --> 28:52.120]  Just like a person, when they've done their work for the day
[28:52.120 --> 28:54.000]  and they're done, they just go lean against the wall.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.560]  Your plant is leaning against the wall.
[28:55.560 --> 28:56.880]  It just puts a hat in its face.
[28:56.880 --> 28:58.480]  It's taking a little break.
[28:58.480 --> 28:59.640]  Purple stems.
[28:59.640 --> 29:02.360]  I don't want you guys to freak out if you see purple stems.
[29:02.360 --> 29:04.960]  That is not a problem with these plants.
[29:04.960 --> 29:07.040]  Sometimes you're going to get purple stems.
[29:07.040 --> 29:08.160]  That is a good thing.
[29:10.880 --> 29:12.680]  You may see purple petioles.
[29:12.680 --> 29:15.080]  You may see straight up purple branches.
[29:15.080 --> 29:16.640]  You may get purple stems.
[29:16.640 --> 29:18.080]  That is not a problem.
[29:18.080 --> 29:20.760]  Those plants will turn into the black phenotypes,
[29:20.760 --> 29:22.520]  the darker-leaved phenotypes.
[29:22.520 --> 29:24.600]  They'll smell gassy and garlicky and delicious.
[29:24.600 --> 29:27.080]  You'll have that Girl Scout cookies dominance in there.
[29:27.080 --> 29:30.400]  I think that those would be great plants for you.
[29:30.400 --> 29:31.920]  Let's see.
[29:31.920 --> 29:34.960]  There's one, I said it smells like a problem.
[29:34.960 --> 29:37.960]  There's one that smells like something's wrong.
[29:37.960 --> 29:42.240]  If you've ever left a pot of soil in water too long
[29:42.240 --> 29:45.720]  and it got sort of a, it's almost crappy.
[29:45.720 --> 29:46.720]  It's moldy.
[29:46.720 --> 29:47.760]  It's funky.
[29:47.760 --> 29:49.440]  It's like dirty water.
[29:49.440 --> 29:51.840]  It almost smells like it needs to be flushed or wiped.
[29:51.840 --> 29:55.760]  It's got a really bad, sour, disgusting smell to it.
[29:55.760 --> 29:58.360]  That's not a problem with that plant.
[29:58.360 --> 30:01.680]  That's just an aroma that one of the phenotypes make.
[30:02.480 --> 30:05.840]  One of the grandparents is Joseph OG,
[30:05.840 --> 30:10.120]  or it's Joseph OG and Chem D makes the Daybreaker.
[30:10.120 --> 30:12.440]  And I think the Joseph OG in there
[30:12.440 --> 30:16.720]  is what is giving us that funky, it's really gross.
[30:16.720 --> 30:19.960]  It makes my nose go, it makes my whole body go, oh,
[30:19.960 --> 30:22.160]  but it smells terrible when it's growing.
[30:22.160 --> 30:23.480]  It smells anaerobic.
[30:23.480 --> 30:26.280]  It smells like you've got some sort of anaerobic fungus
[30:26.280 --> 30:27.280]  going on.
[30:27.280 --> 30:29.720]  And I have never found a problem in the pot.
[30:29.720 --> 30:31.600]  I've never found a problem with that plant.
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.120]  None of the other pots or anything had an issue,
[30:34.120 --> 30:37.360]  but this one plant just made this terrible,
[30:37.360 --> 30:40.720]  barfy, fucking disgusting aroma.
[30:40.720 --> 30:42.720]  And then when you dry it and cure it and smoke it,
[30:42.720 --> 30:44.000]  it is so dank.
[30:44.000 --> 30:45.560]  You can smell it down the block.
[30:45.560 --> 30:48.440]  It's like a garlicky, dirty feet.
[30:48.440 --> 30:51.400]  But when it's growing, if it smells like it's disgusting,
[30:51.400 --> 30:53.200]  don't, don't be worried.
[30:53.200 --> 30:55.200]  I don't think you've got a problem.
[30:55.200 --> 30:56.880]  Like I've said, you could, you could.
[30:56.880 --> 30:59.280]  It smelled like there was something dead in the pot.
[30:59.280 --> 31:01.440]  It smelled like a mouse climbed into the pot,
[31:02.280 --> 31:03.600]  dug a little hole and died in there.
[31:03.600 --> 31:04.680]  And that's what we were smelling,
[31:04.680 --> 31:05.960]  but it was the fucking plant, you guys.
[31:05.960 --> 31:08.680]  So if you get that aroma, you're welcome.
[31:08.680 --> 31:11.360]  And I apologize that I did that to your grow.
[31:12.400 --> 31:13.960]  Grow it, finish it out, dry it and cure it.
[31:13.960 --> 31:15.560]  Let's smoke it, see what it does.
[31:15.560 --> 31:17.840]  Call it that fucking dead mouse phenotype.
[31:17.840 --> 31:19.160]  I don't know, but that exists.
[31:19.160 --> 31:20.320]  That is an opportunity.
[31:20.320 --> 31:21.920]  I just want to make sure that if you get that,
[31:21.920 --> 31:23.840]  you don't freak out because there is one
[31:23.840 --> 31:27.320]  that really smells horrible in the best way.
[31:27.320 --> 31:28.200]  I hope you get it.
[31:28.200 --> 31:29.320]  Send me a clone.
[31:29.320 --> 31:30.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[31:30.400 --> 31:33.680]  I think that wraps up my notes that I took
[31:33.680 --> 31:36.960]  for the review on the strain, Dark Hollow.
[31:36.960 --> 31:39.160]  There are phenotypes that will finish up in eight weeks.
[31:39.160 --> 31:41.480]  There's a good phenotype that wraps up in nine.
[31:41.480 --> 31:43.080]  You'll find some that take 10.
[31:43.080 --> 31:45.680]  I know there are a couple of phenotypes that go longer.
[31:45.680 --> 31:46.720]  You'll be able to tell them
[31:46.720 --> 31:49.280]  by their skinnier, skinnier leaves.
[31:49.280 --> 31:52.000]  The more desirable phenotypes, in my opinion,
[31:52.000 --> 31:53.440]  have wider leaves.
[31:53.440 --> 31:55.360]  The skinnier leaf phenotype you get,
[31:55.360 --> 31:57.600]  you start getting more toward the Golden Goat.
[31:57.600 --> 31:59.200]  I've got plenty of other offerings
[31:59.200 --> 32:02.240]  that give you that Golden Goat dominant flavor and style.
[32:02.240 --> 32:05.120]  So I really look for the wider-leaved phenotypes
[32:05.120 --> 32:06.320]  when it comes to Dark Hollow.
[32:06.320 --> 32:08.480]  That's where you're going to get those garlicky,
[32:08.480 --> 32:10.040]  more savory aromas.
[32:10.040 --> 32:11.720]  It's going to go sweeter.
[32:11.720 --> 32:13.880]  The taller the plant, the skinnier the leaf,
[32:13.880 --> 32:15.240]  I feel like the sweeter
[32:15.240 --> 32:17.360]  and the more tropical flavors you're going to get.
[32:17.360 --> 32:19.560]  So I like those broader leaves.
[32:19.560 --> 32:21.080]  I like the dark colors.
[32:21.080 --> 32:25.160]  I really like the pukey, crappy, gross kind of smell
[32:25.160 --> 32:26.800]  and phenotypes early on.
[32:27.600 --> 32:29.360]  Feeding it, give it cow mag.
[32:29.360 --> 32:31.360]  It will go macro-deficient early.
[32:31.360 --> 32:32.760]  Make sure you give it cow mag.
[32:32.760 --> 32:34.360]  If you start seeing issues early on,
[32:34.360 --> 32:35.920]  it is probably cow mag.
[32:35.920 --> 32:38.360]  If you see those leaves curling up and twisting up,
[32:38.360 --> 32:41.000]  that's just something that the phenotypes do.
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.440]  Sometimes they look like shit by the end,
[32:43.440 --> 32:44.840]  but they really harvest well
[32:44.840 --> 32:46.680]  and they taste amazing and smoke well.
[32:46.680 --> 32:48.680]  So just treat them the best you can.
[32:48.680 --> 32:50.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
[32:50.160 --> 32:51.800]  pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[32:51.800 --> 32:54.640]  smokers and growers, clone cutters and pollen chuckers,
