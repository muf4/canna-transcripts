[00:00.000 --> 00:02.280]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.280 --> 00:06.280]  It's time for episode 417 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.280 --> 00:10.160]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:10.160 --> 00:15.200]  Oregon Elite Seeds will be releasing the first batch of Blue Raspberry Truffle on 420, so
[00:15.200 --> 00:20.080]  make sure you check them out at oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:20.080 --> 00:23.620]  If you're a regular podcast listener, you know that I like to start the show off by
[00:23.620 --> 00:25.480]  talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:25.480 --> 00:31.480]  I just took a delicious dab of Malibu Purikush batter from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:31.480 --> 00:38.320]  The label says this has 67.8% THC and 80.4% total cannabinoids.
[00:38.320 --> 00:41.820]  The color and consistency of this batter are beautiful.
[00:41.820 --> 00:44.200]  It is a really light golden yellow color.
[00:44.200 --> 00:46.600]  It looks, it almost looks fluffy.
[00:46.600 --> 00:47.600]  It is really gorgeous.
[00:47.600 --> 00:51.240]  It looks like a dollop of yellow frosting right in the middle of this container.
[00:51.240 --> 00:53.920]  The aromas coming out of here are delicious.
[00:53.920 --> 00:56.120]  It has a hint of gassiness.
[00:56.120 --> 01:00.680]  There is a hint of fuel, but also an overwhelming scent of pine and kush.
[01:00.680 --> 01:02.840]  This is a delicious concentrate.
[01:02.840 --> 01:07.940]  If you are a kush smoker, if you are into the California kush flavors, the Malibu Purikush
[01:07.940 --> 01:12.200]  batter from Apothecary Farms is a delicious treat.
[01:12.200 --> 01:16.640]  Big shout out to all of my friends at Apothecary Farms for this delicious concentrate.
[01:16.640 --> 01:17.780]  All right, podcast world.
[01:17.780 --> 01:21.880]  In this episode, I am going to read a couple of listener emails, but before we get there,
[01:21.880 --> 01:24.120]  I owe a couple of people some shout outs.
[01:24.120 --> 01:28.080]  How about a big shout out to my friend Steve F. I want to give a big shout out to Richard
[01:28.080 --> 01:29.080]  Memmel.
[01:29.080 --> 01:30.640]  I owe a giant shout out to my friend Sam.
[01:30.640 --> 01:33.680]  A big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Farmer John.
[01:33.680 --> 01:36.800]  A big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Ryan Schmidt.
[01:36.800 --> 01:41.240]  And last but not least, a giant high five and a shout out to my friend Eric Ross.
[01:41.240 --> 01:45.200]  I want to thank each and every one of you for all of the Patreon support.
[01:45.200 --> 01:48.800]  If you would like to learn how to support the show through Patreon, you can do so by
[01:48.800 --> 01:52.840]  going to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:52.840 --> 01:56.560]  All of the information that you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:56.560 --> 01:58.160]  All right, podcast world.
[01:58.160 --> 02:01.520]  I said I was going to read listener emails on this show.
[02:01.520 --> 02:02.860]  Let's jump right into it.
[02:02.860 --> 02:06.000]  Our first email in this episode goes like this.
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.800]  Good afternoon, Rasta Jeff.
[02:07.800 --> 02:10.700]  I just listened to your episode on determining ripeness.
[02:10.700 --> 02:15.080]  I have a strain that has another week of push before I flush the plant.
[02:15.080 --> 02:18.880]  I scoped the trichomes and I noticed that they are all amber.
[02:18.880 --> 02:23.720]  I am not sure what sped up the ripening, but the buds themselves are still pushing.
[02:23.720 --> 02:28.520]  The buds may be pushing, but the main goal is to grow ripe trichomes.
[02:28.520 --> 02:30.160]  You want to harvest when the trichomes are ripe.
[02:30.160 --> 02:34.780]  So even if those buds are still pushing, if the trichomes are ready, it is time to cut.
[02:34.780 --> 02:37.520]  If you don't harvest that plant, those buds will keep pushing.
[02:37.520 --> 02:39.320]  Eventually it will grow itself to death.
[02:39.320 --> 02:43.440]  But if you don't chop it down, if you don't do something, the buds will keep pushing.
[02:43.440 --> 02:46.820]  That is a possibility if you give the plants the opportunity.
[02:46.820 --> 02:49.720]  So you say that the plants are done one week early.
[02:49.720 --> 02:53.500]  You go on to say, I'm wondering what environmental factor could have done this.
[02:53.500 --> 02:56.400]  There are a lot of things that could have done it, but let's read further into this
[02:56.400 --> 02:57.400]  email.
[02:57.400 --> 03:01.320]  I bet we are going to get some hints and some clues and maybe some tips as to what went
[03:01.320 --> 03:02.520]  wrong.
[03:02.520 --> 03:05.360]  The message continues and it goes just like this.
[03:05.360 --> 03:07.320]  Some background on the plants.
[03:07.320 --> 03:08.600]  That's exactly what we need.
[03:08.600 --> 03:12.000]  I had a sulfur burner start fire on week one into flower.
[03:12.360 --> 03:15.280]  That is a good hint of what went wrong in here.
[03:15.280 --> 03:17.400]  Only a few big leaves dried out and died.
[03:17.400 --> 03:21.520]  The canopy is 12 to 16 inches away from the light.
[03:21.520 --> 03:24.320]  I'm using a 1000 watt HPS.
[03:24.320 --> 03:31.160]  The room temps got into the 90s early into flower as I'm running CO2 in late flower 78.
[03:31.160 --> 03:34.480]  I think he's saying it was 78 degrees in late flower.
[03:34.480 --> 03:36.960]  He wraps up the email by wishing me good luck at an event.
[03:36.960 --> 03:38.520]  And then he says, follow my grow.
[03:38.520 --> 03:40.360]  He gives us his Instagram name.
[03:40.360 --> 03:42.080]  He is gallatingardens.
[03:42.080 --> 03:44.720]  It's G-A-L-L-A-T-I-N gardens.
[03:44.720 --> 03:46.720]  And then he says, thanks and signs his name.
[03:46.720 --> 03:49.000]  Hey, thank you for the great email.
[03:49.000 --> 03:50.860]  Gallatin gardens from Instagram.
[03:50.860 --> 03:56.000]  Let's talk a little bit about why your plant may have finished itself a little bit early.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.160]  The first thing I want to touch on again is the goal is ripe trichomes.
[03:59.160 --> 04:01.160]  And you said those plants are still pushing.
[04:01.160 --> 04:03.600]  That doesn't matter if the buds are still swelling.
[04:03.600 --> 04:07.980]  If those trichomes are done, if you've got 20 to 30% amber trichomes, it is probably
[04:07.980 --> 04:08.980]  time to harvest.
[04:08.980 --> 04:12.720]  It's going to quickly be 50 to 60% amber trichomes on that plant.
[04:12.720 --> 04:14.140]  And it will not be as desirable.
[04:14.140 --> 04:15.680]  You will miss your opportunity.
[04:15.680 --> 04:18.880]  So let's talk about reasons why this may have happened.
[04:18.880 --> 04:21.520]  That sulfur burner you talked about in week one, that did not help.
[04:21.520 --> 04:25.500]  That is probably not a major contributing factor because it happened so early, but it
[04:25.500 --> 04:26.720]  certainly did not help.
[04:26.720 --> 04:28.340]  It was not your friend.
[04:28.340 --> 04:32.000]  The next thing I would think about is it probably got kind of warm in there.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.140]  You said the temps got into the nineties early in flower.
[04:35.140 --> 04:37.540]  That probably wasn't helpful either.
[04:37.540 --> 04:38.760]  You say you were running CO2.
[04:38.760 --> 04:43.520]  Yeah, you can go a little hotter, but you also had the lights 12 to 16 inches away.
[04:43.520 --> 04:47.440]  I don't know if you have a glass between the bulbs and the plants.
[04:47.440 --> 04:51.000]  A lot of reflectors have glass in the middle there and they are air cooled so that you're
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.280]  getting that heat away.
[04:52.280 --> 04:54.120]  I don't know your heat situation.
[04:54.120 --> 04:57.780]  It kind of sounds like maybe those plants got a little bit too hot.
[04:57.780 --> 04:59.000]  Perhaps you had the light too close.
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.000]  I don't know.
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.040]  I'm not able to stick my hand in there and feel what those plants feel like.
[05:03.040 --> 05:04.040]  So I don't know.
[05:04.040 --> 05:06.840]  You guys don't be afraid to put your hand around your plants.
[05:07.140 --> 05:09.700]  I don't know if you wear a glove when you do it so you don't get all sticky, but just
[05:09.700 --> 05:10.700]  grab a plant.
[05:10.700 --> 05:11.700]  See what it feels like.
[05:11.700 --> 05:12.700]  You can touch it.
[05:12.700 --> 05:15.220]  As your mom, when you're a little kid, your mom ever reached down and just touched your
[05:15.220 --> 05:16.220]  face and go, you're cold.
[05:16.220 --> 05:17.220]  You need a jacket.
[05:17.220 --> 05:18.220]  You're like, what the fuck?
[05:18.220 --> 05:19.220]  I know when I'm cold.
[05:19.220 --> 05:20.340]  Those plants can't tell you when they're cold.
[05:20.340 --> 05:21.340]  You got to grab them.
[05:21.340 --> 05:22.340]  You can touch them.
[05:22.340 --> 05:23.340]  You can feel them.
[05:23.340 --> 05:24.340]  You can see them.
[05:24.340 --> 05:25.340]  If you're an experienced grower, you can see it.
[05:25.340 --> 05:26.340]  If not, touch them.
[05:26.340 --> 05:27.340]  See how they feel.
[05:27.340 --> 05:28.340]  If they feel cold, they are cold.
[05:28.340 --> 05:30.020]  You need to heat up the room a little bit more.
[05:30.020 --> 05:31.980]  You can do the same with warm plants.
[05:31.980 --> 05:34.320]  Remember when your mom used to reach down and touch your forehead and say, you don't
[05:34.320 --> 05:35.320]  have a fever.
[05:35.320 --> 05:36.320]  You need to go to school.
[05:36.320 --> 05:37.660]  You can tell the same about the plants.
[05:37.660 --> 05:38.660]  Reach down and touch them.
[05:38.660 --> 05:39.660]  Do they feel warm?
[05:39.660 --> 05:40.660]  Do they feel cold?
[05:40.660 --> 05:41.660]  They may be nice and warm.
[05:41.660 --> 05:44.000]  Were the leaves getting taco shaped?
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.360]  Was there any bleaching to the tips of these plants?
[05:46.360 --> 05:49.640]  I'd like to know a few more things and we could help you dial in exactly what made these
[05:49.640 --> 05:52.640]  plants speed up, but I'm thinking they got a little bit hot.
[05:52.640 --> 05:54.160]  They were too close to the light.
[05:54.160 --> 05:56.840]  That sulfur burner certainly was not your friend.
[05:56.840 --> 06:00.360]  And I'm assuming that since you had a little bit of a heat issue and these plants were
[06:00.360 --> 06:05.860]  probably too close to the light, there was probably a poor VPD throughout the growth
[06:05.860 --> 06:06.860]  cycle.
[06:06.860 --> 06:10.620]  The vapor pressure deficit was probably not ideal for these plants, which will increase
[06:10.620 --> 06:11.780]  the ripening time.
[06:11.780 --> 06:12.780]  That is a stress.
[06:12.780 --> 06:16.540]  A little bit of stress may increase ripening times in some plants.
[06:16.540 --> 06:21.460]  Also, I'm going to assume that there were swings in your day and night conditions.
[06:21.460 --> 06:25.660]  Since you had such a high daytime temperature, I'm assuming that your nighttime temperature
[06:25.660 --> 06:29.260]  probably dropped fairly low and you were having a large swing.
[06:29.260 --> 06:33.880]  That may have encouraged your plants to speed up a little bit and finish sooner than you
[06:33.880 --> 06:34.960]  expected.
[06:34.960 --> 06:38.840]  I think the CO2 probably helped them speed up a little bit as well.
[06:38.840 --> 06:43.320]  It is possible that one of your nutrients made these plants finish a little bit early.
[06:43.320 --> 06:44.960]  I am not sure what you fed them.
[06:44.960 --> 06:50.280]  Again, I am assuming on the vapor pressure deficit situation and your diurnal swings,
[06:50.280 --> 06:53.120]  I don't know what the environment in your room was like.
[06:53.120 --> 06:56.920]  I don't know, but I'm assuming that since you had high temperatures and you had issues
[06:56.940 --> 07:01.740]  before that you're probably having other environmental issues and those may be contributing factors
[07:01.740 --> 07:06.980]  to why your plants are finishing a little bit earlier than anticipated.
[07:06.980 --> 07:11.580]  Now here is my main question that I probably should have asked very first.
[07:11.580 --> 07:15.900]  Why do you feel like the plants are finishing a week ahead of schedule?
[07:15.900 --> 07:17.940]  What gave you that schedule?
[07:17.940 --> 07:22.160]  Did the seeds come with a thing that says, these plants finish in eight to nine weeks
[07:22.160 --> 07:25.060]  and you think they're eight to nine weeks in and it's time to cut them?
[07:25.160 --> 07:30.080]  Did your friends say, hey, I ran this clone in my room and it takes exactly 63 days.
[07:30.080 --> 07:34.240]  I want to kind of know what gave you the idea that these plants have the flowering time
[07:34.240 --> 07:35.340]  you think they have.
[07:35.340 --> 07:36.500]  Are you experienced with them?
[07:36.500 --> 07:37.880]  Have you ran them before?
[07:37.880 --> 07:43.040]  If you haven't ran them at least two times before, you don't know well enough to say
[07:43.040 --> 07:44.960]  that they are behind schedule.
[07:44.960 --> 07:48.300]  Sometimes they change with the very slightest changes in your environment, with the very
[07:48.300 --> 07:50.500]  slightest changes in your feed.
[07:50.500 --> 07:54.720]  So I'm very curious what gives you the idea that these plants should be done in the specific
[07:54.740 --> 07:57.260]  timeframe in which you have decided.
[07:57.260 --> 07:58.620]  I'm not doubting your grow knowledge.
[07:58.620 --> 07:59.700]  I'm not doubting your skill.
[07:59.700 --> 08:02.300]  I just wonder where this number came from.
[08:02.300 --> 08:05.860]  Now, if that number came from a seed pack and this is your first run, you've got to
[08:05.860 --> 08:06.860]  be more flexible.
[08:06.860 --> 08:08.860]  You've got to let the plants do their thing.
[08:08.860 --> 08:10.500]  And again, I'm not second guessing you're growing.
[08:10.500 --> 08:11.540]  These are all hypothetical.
[08:11.540 --> 08:15.140]  So if you've got it from seed, you need to let it go long enough to see what it does.
[08:15.140 --> 08:17.380]  Don't worry about what the number on the package says.
[08:17.380 --> 08:19.260]  That is the ideal time.
[08:19.260 --> 08:21.340]  You're going to get outliers that take longer.
[08:21.340 --> 08:23.300]  You're going to get outliers that finish sooner.
[08:23.400 --> 08:28.600]  So if it's from a seed pack, you've got to be a little more flexible with your timeframes.
[08:28.600 --> 08:33.520]  If the clone came from a friend and your friend said that it takes a certain amount of time,
[08:33.520 --> 08:36.520]  who knows if your friend is a good judge of ripeness.
[08:36.520 --> 08:39.840]  Who knows what type of environment your friend was using.
[08:39.840 --> 08:42.400]  Maybe he was running an LED, you're running an HPS.
[08:42.400 --> 08:45.040]  Maybe he was feeding it Botanicare and you're feeding it whatever.
[08:45.040 --> 08:48.320]  I don't want to assume what you're feeding, but maybe a lot of things could have been
[08:48.320 --> 08:53.580]  different and a few different things can make the plants finish a week earlier or a
[08:53.580 --> 08:57.500]  week later, just depending on what you're doing in the grow.
[08:57.500 --> 08:59.760]  Certain stresses can speed up ripeness.
[08:59.760 --> 09:01.940]  Some stresses can slow down ripeness.
[09:01.940 --> 09:05.300]  Some environmental factors will make the trichomes ripen more early.
[09:05.300 --> 09:08.620]  Some environmental factors will make the trichomes ripen later.
[09:08.620 --> 09:12.820]  I don't know what happened in your grow room, but it sounds like you had quite a few stresses
[09:12.820 --> 09:14.780]  and they probably contributed.
[09:14.780 --> 09:18.720]  Each and every one of them contributed a small bit to these plants finishing sooner
[09:18.720 --> 09:20.280]  than you may have anticipated.
[09:20.280 --> 09:24.720]  Again, I don't know how you have decided that these plants should be done by now.
[09:24.720 --> 09:26.600]  Maybe you've grown them 20 times and you know.
[09:26.600 --> 09:31.440]  I don't know what your situation is, but all of these small stressors seem to have added
[09:31.440 --> 09:36.040]  up to making these plants finish earlier than you think they should have finished.
[09:36.040 --> 09:39.460]  I'm going to say they are possibly in panic mode.
[09:39.460 --> 09:41.560]  They know that they are getting beat up.
[09:41.560 --> 09:46.060]  They know that they've had a lot of problems and they're just looking for time to clock
[09:46.060 --> 09:47.060]  out.
[09:47.060 --> 09:48.060]  They're really just done.
[09:48.060 --> 09:49.240]  They're like, is it done yet?
[09:49.240 --> 09:52.860]  They're just ready to clock out and go home, smoke a joint like we talked about in a previous
[09:52.860 --> 09:53.860]  episode.
[09:53.860 --> 09:56.980]  So they're finishing up their life cycle and they're just wrapping it up.
[09:56.980 --> 09:58.780]  They're just ripening up so that you'll cut them down.
[09:58.780 --> 09:59.780]  Like, hey, I'm done.
[09:59.780 --> 10:01.140]  Just shot me down, dude.
[10:01.140 --> 10:05.460]  Now another thing we should consider that I just thought about is foliar sprays.
[10:05.460 --> 10:07.940]  Have you sprayed these plants with anything?
[10:07.940 --> 10:10.580]  Foliar sprays can mess up your trichomes.
[10:10.600 --> 10:13.800]  Foliar sprays can mess up everything if you do it too late in flower.
[10:13.800 --> 10:16.160]  So did you foliar spray?
[10:16.160 --> 10:19.920]  Also you say that you had that sulfur burner catch on fire early in flower.
[10:19.920 --> 10:22.880]  How late into flower did you run that sulfur burner?
[10:22.880 --> 10:25.680]  Did you keep that going into week six, into week seven?
[10:25.680 --> 10:30.440]  That also could have done damage and sped up the ripening of your trichomes.
[10:30.440 --> 10:36.240]  Another thing that may have sped up the ripening of these plants is a reduction in light.
[10:36.240 --> 10:39.760]  Did these plants start getting less light than what they were used to?
[10:39.940 --> 10:42.180]  A light reduction could speed up the plants.
[10:42.180 --> 10:45.420]  The plants think that the end of season is coming and they will speed up a little more
[10:45.420 --> 10:46.420]  quickly.
[10:46.420 --> 10:50.180]  If I've got a plant that won't finish in the amount of time I want it to finish, sometimes
[10:50.180 --> 10:51.260]  I will reduce the lights.
[10:51.260 --> 10:52.820]  I'll go from 12, 12.
[10:52.820 --> 10:55.820]  I'll start off with 11 on and 13 of dark.
[10:55.820 --> 11:00.140]  And then sometimes I'll go like 10 hours on and 14 hours of darkness.
[11:00.140 --> 11:04.900]  And then really late in flower with some really picky cultivars, I will have as little as
[11:04.900 --> 11:09.600]  eight hours of daylight and 16 hours of darkness each cycle.
[11:09.600 --> 11:11.720]  And that really speeds up those plants of finishing.
[11:11.720 --> 11:15.080]  So did these plants get a light reduction?
[11:15.080 --> 11:16.640]  Did a bulb go out?
[11:16.640 --> 11:18.000]  Is a bulb going out?
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.700]  Is it time to replace a bulb?
[11:19.700 --> 11:23.400]  Is there an issue in the grow room to where this plant got moved away?
[11:23.400 --> 11:28.080]  Also I'm very curious, where are you checking the trichomes on the plant?
[11:28.080 --> 11:31.320]  Trichomes on the top of the plant, trichomes in the middle of the plant and the trichomes
[11:31.320 --> 11:34.400]  on the bottom are going to be ripe at different times.
[11:34.400 --> 11:37.260]  So you may need to check the plant in different areas.
[11:37.260 --> 11:39.700]  I am really not trying to sound like I'm second guessing you.
[11:39.700 --> 11:44.060]  I am just simply listing things that I think may apply to your situation that you may have
[11:44.060 --> 11:45.060]  not noticed.
[11:45.060 --> 11:48.140]  I am not trying to doubt your ability or your skills as a grower.
[11:48.140 --> 11:49.140]  You reached out with a question.
[11:49.140 --> 11:52.060]  I'm just doing my best to cover all of the options.
[11:52.060 --> 11:56.500]  So my main assumption is that your plants finished earlier due to stress.
[11:56.500 --> 12:00.280]  That stress was probably from the heat, probably from the sulfur burner.
[12:00.280 --> 12:03.300]  That CO2 probably did speed them up just a little bit.
[12:03.300 --> 12:07.480]  Perhaps you fed them something that made them ripen a little more early than you had
[12:07.480 --> 12:08.480]  anticipated.
[12:08.480 --> 12:13.120]  Also, I wonder where you got this arbitrary number of when they are supposed to be finished.
[12:13.120 --> 12:15.440]  Again, I don't know if you've grown these plants 20 times.
[12:15.440 --> 12:17.040]  I don't know if it is your second run.
[12:17.040 --> 12:18.800]  I don't know where you got this number.
[12:18.800 --> 12:21.160]  Maybe you need to adjust that number.
[12:21.160 --> 12:24.640]  Maybe the plants were sprayed with something that would have damaged the trichomes.
[12:24.640 --> 12:28.660]  Then my last suggestion, suspicion that I would like to talk about is perhaps those
[12:28.660 --> 12:30.160]  lights are going out.
[12:30.160 --> 12:32.040]  Maybe one of your bulbs is bad.
[12:32.140 --> 12:33.820]  Perhaps one of your ballast is bad.
[12:33.820 --> 12:37.620]  Maybe you're running a thousand watt and you're not getting a thousand watts coming out.
[12:37.620 --> 12:40.040]  So maybe you need to invest in a lumen meter.
[12:40.040 --> 12:42.000]  Maybe you need to borrow one from the grow store.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.280]  Maybe you just need to replace that bulb and see if that was the issue.
[12:45.280 --> 12:46.500]  That is just a suggestion.
[12:46.500 --> 12:48.060]  Again, I am not in your grow.
[12:48.060 --> 12:51.140]  I've only got the information that you sent me.
[12:51.140 --> 12:52.660]  You sent a lot of great information.
[12:52.660 --> 12:55.380]  I hope I gave you a lot of good advice in return.
[12:55.380 --> 12:57.660]  Hey, I want to thank you for the great email.
[12:57.660 --> 13:00.980]  I look forward to hearing about how this crop came out.
[13:00.980 --> 13:01.980]  Give me an update.
[13:02.040 --> 13:04.000]  Let me know how was the final product.
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.360]  How long did you let it grow?
[13:05.360 --> 13:06.360]  When did you cut it down?
[13:06.360 --> 13:08.000]  How long did you dry and cure it?
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.920]  How did it smoke when you got to test it?
[13:09.920 --> 13:12.440]  And what are you going to do different in your next grow?
[13:12.440 --> 13:14.600]  Hey, thanks again for the great email.
[13:14.600 --> 13:18.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, I just got a text message letting me know that my next appointment has
[13:18.400 --> 13:19.920]  been moved to an earlier time.
[13:19.920 --> 13:21.520]  So I've got a meeting that I need to get to.
[13:21.520 --> 13:23.000]  I need to wrap up this podcast.
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.160]  I want to thank you guys for listening to a quick episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[13:26.160 --> 13:27.160]  podcast.
