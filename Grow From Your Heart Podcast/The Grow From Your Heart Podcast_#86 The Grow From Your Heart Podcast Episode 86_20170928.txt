[00:54.150 --> 00:57.150]  You guys, I am joined once again by my good friends, Joe.
[00:57.150 --> 00:59.150]  Welcome back, brother Joe. Thanks for joining me.
[00:59.150 --> 01:01.150]  Oh, it's a pleasure, Jeff.
[01:03.150 --> 01:06.150]  Oh, the sarcastic tone in your voice is beautiful, my friend.
[01:06.150 --> 01:07.150]  Now, thanks for joining me once again.

[01:11.150 --> 01:12.150]  How are you, brother?
[01:12.150 --> 01:14.150]  I'm doing well, bro. What's up, stoner people?
[01:14.150 --> 01:17.150]  What's up, stoner people, stoner dudes, and stoner stone-ettes.
[01:17.150 --> 01:18.150]  Stone-ettes.
[01:18.150 --> 01:20.150]  And also the people that don't even smoke. You guys, what's up? Thanks for joining us.
[01:20.150 --> 01:25.150]  You guys that are just listening in to learn about cannabis and get a little bit of insight into our world here in Colorado,

[02:29.150 --> 02:32.150]  That's enough for the technical ads and all that stuff.
[02:32.150 --> 02:37.150]  Ladies and gentlemen, the reason we have gathered here today, I want to talk to my buddy Sloppy.
[02:37.150 --> 02:39.150]  He was talking about wanting to be on the podcast, and I was like,
[02:39.150 --> 02:41.150]  well, what's up, bro? What do you want to talk about?
[02:41.150 --> 02:45.150]  And he's like, I want to talk about my life-changing transition from...
[02:46.150 --> 02:48.150]  I'm going to kind of summarize here.
[02:48.150 --> 02:50.150]  Slop's kind of a buff dude.
[02:50.150 --> 02:52.150]  He's got some muscles on him. He's tatted up.
[02:52.150 --> 02:56.150]  He looks like he could be the guy in Grand Theft Auto, kind of.
[02:56.150 --> 02:59.150]  Yo, hey. That's funny.
[02:59.150 --> 03:02.150]  No, people, people. I was going to talk about that too.
[03:02.150 --> 03:05.150]  People would look at me and just assume I'm just an asshole.
[03:05.150 --> 03:07.150]  I hold the door for people and they're like, should I walk through?
[03:07.150 --> 03:09.150]  I'm like, I'm not going to slam it on you.
[03:09.150 --> 03:11.150]  You're like, headband right now.
[03:11.150 --> 03:14.150]  Yeah, well, he's grown a little bit of a fuzzy hair, dude.
[03:14.150 --> 03:15.150]  That's the longest I've ever seen his hair.
[03:15.150 --> 03:17.150]  I wasn't going to let the man get called out on that.
[03:17.150 --> 03:18.150]  The fro is strong.
[03:18.150 --> 03:19.150]  No, I got no issues with that.
[03:19.150 --> 03:21.150]  The fro is strong in this one.
[03:21.150 --> 03:25.150]  Slop looks like a straight criminal, and we're not going to get too deep into it,
[03:25.150 --> 03:27.150]  but Sloppy does have a history.
[03:27.150 --> 03:31.150]  And Slop has moved to Colorado, and I've heard a lot about Slop.
[03:31.150 --> 03:34.150]  I know about Slop's past. I know where he's come from.
[03:34.150 --> 03:36.150]  And to tell you the truth, man, since I've known you,
[03:36.150 --> 03:41.150]  you've been nothing but a respectful, respectable, fucking generous, honest dude.
[03:41.150 --> 03:42.150]  Thank you.
[03:42.150 --> 03:45.150]  Oh, for sure, man. Fist bump across the table here. Much respect.
[03:45.150 --> 03:46.150]  And if any of you guys need a dab, let me know.
[03:46.150 --> 03:49.150]  I know Joe's hanging out over here, kind of quiet, kind of listening in, hanging out.
[03:49.150 --> 03:51.150]  He'll chime in when he's got something worth saying.
[03:51.150 --> 03:53.150]  But if you guys need a dab, let me know. We'll get it going.
[03:53.150 --> 03:55.150]  I'll slide the dabs over here if they're in reach.
[03:55.150 --> 03:56.150]  Yeah, I'm always with dabbing.
[03:56.150 --> 03:57.150]  Right.
[03:57.150 --> 04:00.150]  So, yeah, I was telling everybody how much of a criminal you are
[04:00.150 --> 04:03.150]  and how much when I finally meet you, you're fucking respectful.
[04:03.150 --> 04:09.150]  You would never assume that I had any kind of, besides just stereotyping,
[04:09.150 --> 04:11.150]  like tattoos and things of that nature.
[04:11.150 --> 04:12.150]  You weren't a wife beater in some shorts.
[04:12.150 --> 04:15.150]  Yeah, I mean, hey, we can't be seen right now. I can't be comfortable.
[04:15.150 --> 04:16.150]  Right.
[04:16.150 --> 04:19.150]  But, yeah, besides stereotyping, like just from appearance,
[04:19.150 --> 04:24.150]  the way that I present myself, you wouldn't really assume that I had any past experience
[04:24.150 --> 04:27.150]  with organizations or just criminal activity at all.
[04:28.150 --> 04:34.150]  But, man, the main thing I want to talk about is just really like how much it's changed,
[04:34.150 --> 04:39.150]  being able to smoke bud freely and grow bud and the stress reliever that comes with it.
[04:39.150 --> 04:42.150]  I mean, I started smoking weed back in fifth grade.
[04:42.150 --> 04:44.150]  I don't know the age that you are in fifth grade.
[04:44.150 --> 04:46.150]  I think you're 11.
[04:46.150 --> 04:47.150]  Yeah.
[04:47.150 --> 04:48.150]  You're 11 or 12.
[04:48.150 --> 04:49.150]  I wouldn't want to just, you know.
[04:49.150 --> 04:50.150]  You were probably 14.
[04:50.150 --> 04:53.150]  What happened, I never failed. I actually always had good grades.
[04:53.150 --> 04:54.150]  You're a smart guy, dude.
[04:54.150 --> 04:56.150]  Yeah, I was just an asshole.
[04:57.150 --> 04:59.150]  I went to a minority school.
[04:59.150 --> 05:00.150]  I am not a minority.
[05:00.150 --> 05:04.150]  So I was integrated into a minority school and put in the paper and stuff.
[05:04.150 --> 05:07.150]  And it was fifth grade through 12th grade in one school.
[05:07.150 --> 05:10.150]  And I used to walk home with all the older kids.
[05:10.150 --> 05:13.150]  I won't say any names, but shout out to who you are.
[05:14.150 --> 05:17.150]  And, you know, the neighborhood was right behind the school.
[05:17.150 --> 05:20.150]  So we'd walk home and they always smoked every day.
[05:20.150 --> 05:23.150]  And then one day they were just like, do you want to smoke too?
[05:23.150 --> 05:24.150]  And I didn't even know it was bad.
[05:24.150 --> 05:25.150]  I've seen other people smoke cigarettes.
[05:25.150 --> 05:28.150]  I didn't really know the difference between what people are smoking.
[05:28.150 --> 05:31.150]  And I remember that day we smoked a blunt.
[05:31.150 --> 05:36.150]  We went and sat in their shed and played Sega Genesis for like two hours until my mom got off work.
[05:36.150 --> 05:41.150]  And they never brought up anything being wrong until right when my mom was going to get there.
[05:41.150 --> 05:45.150]  And they looked at me and said, tell her you have a headache and go to your room.
[05:45.150 --> 05:47.150]  Don't eat anything.
[05:47.150 --> 05:50.150]  And then that was the daily routine after that forever.
[05:50.150 --> 05:54.150]  But I've always had to hide smoking weed and all of that.
[05:55.150 --> 06:01.150]  I have a paraphernalia charge for a roach, literally just a roach in North Carolina.
[06:02.150 --> 06:04.150]  That's where I'm from, North Carolina.
[06:04.150 --> 06:06.150]  They're assholes like they don't care.
[06:07.150 --> 06:09.150]  They came to a house.
[06:09.150 --> 06:10.150]  They were serving a warrant.
[06:10.150 --> 06:12.150]  They smelled marijuana, came in the house.
[06:12.150 --> 06:14.150]  They I was there was like.
[06:15.150 --> 06:17.150]  I was the only white person there.
[06:18.150 --> 06:24.150]  And there was like two bongs in the house and the police came up to me and they were like, oh, these must be yours because you're white.
[06:24.150 --> 06:25.150]  And I'm a smart ass.
[06:25.150 --> 06:26.150]  So I looked at them.
[06:26.150 --> 06:31.150]  I was like, actually, I smoke blunts instead of just being like, I don't smoke because, you know, I'm an asshole.
[06:32.150 --> 06:36.150]  So they walked over to the ashtray, grabbed a roach, dropped in front of me and said paraphernalia.
[06:36.150 --> 06:39.150]  And it is still to this day on my record.
[06:39.150 --> 06:41.150]  Was that a felony or a misdemeanor?
[06:41.150 --> 06:42.150]  Misdemeanor.
[06:43.150 --> 06:49.150]  I hate that there's only two levels of charges, like misdemeanor felony, because felonies are in there with like rapists and murderers.
[06:49.150 --> 06:50.150]  That's that's messed up.
[06:50.150 --> 06:53.150]  Like in North Carolina, you can get a felony.
[06:53.150 --> 06:54.150]  I think they changed it now.
[06:54.150 --> 06:58.150]  But when I was growing up, anything over a half ounce of marijuana was a felony.
[06:58.150 --> 07:00.150]  So you'd be put in with a rapist.
[07:00.150 --> 07:01.150]  Yeah. For having to lead.
[07:01.150 --> 07:02.150]  It's ridiculous.
[07:03.150 --> 07:04.150]  But now I'm in there.
[07:04.150 --> 07:05.150]  Yeah. Right.
[07:05.150 --> 07:06.150]  I don't need that.
[07:07.150 --> 07:10.150]  But now I think you can have an ounce and a half, which still isn't shit.
[07:10.150 --> 07:12.150]  Like you can have a pound and a half.
[07:12.150 --> 07:13.150]  You're not going to hurt anybody.
[07:13.150 --> 07:15.150]  It's all about what you're doing.
[07:15.150 --> 07:21.150]  But marijuana really gave me an out from where I was.
[07:21.150 --> 07:29.150]  Before I was in Colorado, I was in a camper that was like 10 by 10 with no insulation.
[07:29.150 --> 07:31.150]  It had nails coming through the roof.
[07:31.150 --> 07:39.150]  And I literally ran an extension cord from the camper to somebody's well, because you know, at the well, they have the outlets for like lights and stuff.
[07:39.150 --> 07:46.150]  And I had my Mac computer in there and I just made music and smoked weed and did mushrooms and stuff.
[07:46.150 --> 07:47.150]  Sounds like a good life.
[07:47.150 --> 07:51.150]  It was all right, but it was somehow I still got women there.
[07:51.150 --> 07:53.150]  I don't know how, but it was shitty, you know.
[07:53.150 --> 08:02.150]  And then one day, a good friend of mine, Spencer from Garden Weedin, big shout out to all of them, Maddie, Mike, everybody really.
[08:02.150 --> 08:05.150]  But he just called or like we were talking on Facebook at first.
[08:05.150 --> 08:08.150]  And then he called me and he was like, are you really sleeping outside?
[08:08.150 --> 08:11.150]  And I was like, yeah, I mean, it's not really outside, but yeah, kind of.
[08:11.150 --> 08:14.150]  He's like, well, would you rather just come here and grow weed?
[08:14.150 --> 08:18.150]  And it was really an impulse decision.
[08:18.150 --> 08:20.150]  Like everybody thought I was bullshitting.
[08:20.150 --> 08:21.150]  I was like in two weeks, I'm out.
[08:21.150 --> 08:23.150]  Like I'm going to Colorado.
[08:23.150 --> 08:24.150]  That's kind of how I heard it, too.
[08:24.150 --> 08:26.150]  Maddie was like, you're going to meet our friend Sloppy in like two weeks.
[08:26.150 --> 08:28.150]  He's going to take the room downstairs.
[08:28.150 --> 08:29.150]  And I was like, all right.
[08:29.150 --> 08:34.150]  And I did take that room and I slept right next to that oven forever and just like chilled out.
[08:35.150 --> 08:37.150]  But yeah, no, I did.
[08:37.150 --> 08:39.150]  I just told everybody I was leaving.
[08:39.150 --> 08:40.150]  Nobody believed me.
[08:40.150 --> 08:42.150]  Two weeks came and I was gone.
[08:42.150 --> 08:44.150]  And I don't miss it at all.
[08:44.150 --> 08:46.150]  It's been amazing here.
[08:46.150 --> 08:56.150]  Just there's so many people with the same mind state and positive energies and just trying to help each other and progress in life.
[08:56.150 --> 08:58.150]  I feel like that's big.
[08:58.150 --> 08:59.150]  People don't like progressing.
[08:59.150 --> 09:00.150]  I mean.
[09:00.150 --> 09:01.150]  Right.
[09:01.150 --> 09:02.150]  Some people are stuck and want to be OK with where they are.
[09:02.150 --> 09:03.150]  Yeah.
[09:03.150 --> 09:04.150]  It's like being content.
[09:04.150 --> 09:05.150]  That's such a plague.
[09:05.150 --> 09:10.150]  That's why I got this group of people here at this table because we're all people that are all about moving each other and ourselves forward a little bit.
[09:10.150 --> 09:11.150]  Can't ever be comfortable.
[09:11.150 --> 09:12.150]  No, no.
[09:12.150 --> 09:14.150]  As soon as you get comfortable, that's when you start fucking up.
[09:14.150 --> 09:15.150]  Stagnation.
[09:15.150 --> 09:16.150]  Yeah.
[09:16.150 --> 09:17.150]  If you want to be ahead, you got to keep moving.
[09:17.150 --> 09:18.150]  Right.
[09:18.150 --> 09:19.150]  Yeah.
[09:19.150 --> 09:27.150]  If your if life is super duper easy and you do the same thing every day and not much changes and you're unhappy about it.
[09:27.150 --> 09:29.150]  There's only one thing to do.
[09:29.150 --> 09:30.150]  That's right.
[09:30.150 --> 09:31.150]  Yep.
[09:31.150 --> 09:32.150]  Make the progression.
[09:32.150 --> 09:36.150]  Like if you're already stuck and frustrated, what are you going to do to make yourself more stuck and frustrated?
[09:36.150 --> 09:37.150]  Like you got to think it through.
[09:37.150 --> 09:40.150]  But I mean, yeah, grab your nutsack and let's do it.
[09:40.150 --> 09:44.150]  Like our good friend Joey Diaz would say, grow some fucking balls, cocksucker.
[09:44.150 --> 09:45.150]  Yes.
[09:45.150 --> 09:46.150]  Yes, he would say.
[09:46.150 --> 09:47.150]  Don't be scared.
[09:47.150 --> 09:48.150]  Yeah.
[09:48.150 --> 09:51.150]  All right, so you were moving in a trailer and big shout out to Garden of Weeden because you know what?
[09:51.150 --> 09:54.150]  If Spence and Maddie would not have encouraged you to move out here, I would never have met you.
[09:54.150 --> 09:56.150]  So much love, much respect to that whole crew.
[09:56.150 --> 09:58.150]  There are some of my favorite people right now.
[09:58.150 --> 09:59.150]  Yeah.
[09:59.150 --> 10:00.150]  Yeah, for sure.
[10:00.150 --> 10:01.150]  I wouldn't know Joe either.
[10:01.150 --> 10:02.150]  Yeah.
[10:02.150 --> 10:03.150]  Yeah, I mentioned Garden of Weeden.
[10:03.150 --> 10:04.150]  Garden of Weeden is a beautiful bunch.
[10:04.150 --> 10:07.150]  They have only shown me extreme love in all situations.
[10:07.150 --> 10:09.150]  All the people that they've introduced to me have been totally cool.
[10:09.150 --> 10:10.150]  All right.
[10:10.150 --> 10:15.150]  So you came out here and now you live with Spence for a little while and you started learning how to grow.
[10:15.150 --> 10:16.150]  Yes.
[10:16.150 --> 10:25.150]  It was like I can remember so vividly the first time that Garden of Weeden.
[10:25.150 --> 10:29.150]  Oh, I can remember the first time I took an official dab.
[10:29.150 --> 10:30.150]  Nice.
[10:30.150 --> 10:36.150]  Oh, well, I got off the plane and they got a dab ready.
[10:36.150 --> 10:42.150]  And when she pulled the rig and the torch out, Maddie pulled the rig and the torch out, I looked at her and I was like, I don't really know what that is.
[10:42.150 --> 10:44.150]  I don't know if I want to smoke that.
[10:44.150 --> 10:45.150]  And she was like, no, it's weed.
[10:45.150 --> 10:47.150]  I was like, weed is green.
[10:47.150 --> 10:50.150]  That's not weed.
[10:50.150 --> 10:57.150]  And then I took a dab and I literally just laid my face on the window and just stared.
[10:57.150 --> 10:59.150]  So you're saying you might have been in the car when you got your first dab?
[10:59.150 --> 11:00.150]  Yes.
[11:00.150 --> 11:01.150]  So you were off the plane.
[11:01.150 --> 11:02.150]  Boom.
[11:02.150 --> 11:08.150]  Within three seconds of being in the car, she was like.
[11:08.150 --> 11:09.150]  Shout out to Maddie.
[11:09.150 --> 11:11.150]  Maddie loves us and Maddie dabs everybody out.
[11:11.150 --> 11:13.150]  If I go sit down at the house, Maddie's got you want to dab?
[11:13.150 --> 11:15.150]  Like as soon as I walk in.
[11:15.150 --> 11:16.150]  It's globs.
[11:16.150 --> 11:18.150]  She globs you out.
[11:18.150 --> 11:19.150]  Here's a half gram.
[11:19.150 --> 11:20.150]  Welcome to the house.
[11:20.150 --> 11:21.150]  Right.
[11:21.150 --> 11:22.150]  Yep.
[11:22.150 --> 11:23.150]  Joe's nodding his head like.
[11:23.150 --> 11:24.150]  Yeah.
[11:24.150 --> 11:25.150]  I can't add anything to that.
[11:25.150 --> 11:26.150]  That is 100% accurate.
[11:26.150 --> 11:27.150]  Yes.
[11:27.150 --> 11:28.150]  But I can.
[11:28.150 --> 11:29.150]  Oh, go ahead.
[11:29.150 --> 11:30.150]  I can.
[11:30.150 --> 11:36.150]  I can totally remember the first time that they were like the lights cut on and they were like brought me into the garden.
[11:36.150 --> 11:38.150]  It was.
[11:38.150 --> 11:45.150]  I would like to say it was all white widow and two blue dream plants in there and all you could smell was the blue dream.
[11:45.150 --> 11:46.150]  It was.
[11:46.150 --> 11:47.150]  That is correct.
[11:47.150 --> 11:48.150]  Amazing.
[11:48.150 --> 11:49.150]  Yes.
[11:49.150 --> 11:50.150]  That sounds about right.
[11:50.150 --> 11:51.150]  I remember those days.
[11:51.150 --> 12:01.150]  Like in my body of like overwhelming sensations that like I honestly thought that I would never experience something like that without going to another country because it's crazy.
[12:01.150 --> 12:02.150]  It's just plants.
[12:02.150 --> 12:07.150]  But back in North Carolina, if you have that many plans, you are a they they think you're a fucking terrorist.
[12:07.150 --> 12:16.150]  Like, they're like, they like come SWAT force ready, tasing and shooting like this plan is going to spread like Jumanji and kill the town like so ridiculous.
[12:16.150 --> 12:19.070]  ridiculous but the worst thing about a raid man is the first thing they do is
[12:19.070 --> 12:24.230]  shoot your dog oh and I know this sounds crazy but if they shoot my dog in front
[12:24.230 --> 12:28.590]  of me it's going down like I'm going to strike an officer I don't want to say
[12:28.590 --> 12:32.110]  that but for real I know hypothetically you just might yeah yeah for real
[12:32.110 --> 12:35.710]  because that's a loved family man it's a Harvey and Bane yeah for sure oh and
[12:35.710 --> 12:39.430]  they're monsters now they need their own Instagram bro they need their own
[12:39.430 --> 12:44.830]  Instagram motion yeah bro stuff yeah man these dogs are badass they need their
[12:44.830 --> 12:50.030]  own Instagram shout out to pitbulls yeah they're my yo and I I hate the
[12:50.030 --> 12:53.150]  judgment on pitbulls like how you can't bring them to Denver and stuff that's
[12:53.150 --> 12:59.110]  like yeah one of the sweetest dogs I know is a pitbull and she will climb up
[12:59.110 --> 13:02.530]  into your lap and let you pet her like a kitty yeah and she's precious and she's
[13:02.530 --> 13:06.350]  a pitbull and she's all about competence her boyfriend slash brother cuz I'm not
[13:06.350 --> 13:12.790]  sure what the relationship is there I've seen a little bit of both but uh that
[13:12.790 --> 13:16.590]  dude is also what he's a dumbass but he's one of the sweetest dogs ever
[13:16.590 --> 13:20.830]  it's made of bricks but he's still one of the coolest dogs dogs are the same as
[13:20.830 --> 13:25.790]  children you can raise them to be good or you can raise dumbasses like it's
[13:25.790 --> 13:30.710]  some dogs got some shit in them yeah some soda some children that is the
[13:30.710 --> 13:34.590]  truth some doctors born a little demon inside just like some kids that's true
[13:34.590 --> 13:40.270]  you gotta slap this shit out of him once in a while um but yo I'm yo I'm down yo
[13:40.270 --> 13:44.830]  ask me what questions I don't bash you with questions I'm with whatever man I
[13:44.830 --> 13:47.230]  was like hearing about how you moved here and then you started growing weed
[13:47.230 --> 13:50.410]  and you saw some white widow and some blue dream and it was fucking mind did
[13:50.410 --> 13:57.270]  you get to trim that oh oh my first trim I remember everybody was all like like
[13:57.270 --> 14:03.470]  not wanting to trim acting like it was about to be this like hard yeah and then
[14:03.470 --> 14:08.030]  my first time I was like this is like fucking awesome you know like this is
[14:08.030 --> 14:11.430]  the greatest thing ever and now you know I've trimmed like a hundred or so
[14:11.430 --> 14:16.310]  more plants and I'm like fuck trimming but I can totally remember the first
[14:16.310 --> 14:20.510]  time doing it and I love if I have company from out of town coming trying
[14:20.510 --> 14:24.470]  to get them into a harvest and just get them involved in any way because like I
[14:24.470 --> 14:30.230]  said like a lot of people on on the in any legal states in general just think
[14:30.230 --> 14:36.150]  that like this is impossible like yeah oh yeah it's mine yeah yeah this is
[14:36.150 --> 14:39.550]  something we can totally do we can legalize cannabis nationwide we can all
[14:39.550 --> 14:42.390]  be growing a little bit of ganja in our house and I have to go to a store not
[14:42.390 --> 14:46.430]  have to excuse me not have to go to the street corner I'd have to fucking waste
[14:46.430 --> 14:49.390]  money on cannabis and I'd have to worry or wonder we were all talking about
[14:49.390 --> 14:53.030]  earlier how we all love that we grow the weed in the group yeah like we you bring
[14:53.030 --> 14:56.390]  your herb and I'm not afraid to smoke Joe's herb and sloppy brings his herb
[14:56.390 --> 14:59.110]  and I'll totally smoke that and I pull out mine and they will totally smoke
[14:59.110 --> 15:02.710]  that but if anybody else came up there'd be a few people there's some residents
[15:02.710 --> 15:06.270]  like I don't know man would you put in this shit it wasn't always like that I
[15:06.270 --> 15:09.390]  used to smoke some straight brick weed that's what I started out with but you
[15:09.390 --> 15:14.630]  know everybody in the 90s I was smoking that sexy Mexi brick for sure 500 a
[15:14.630 --> 15:19.990]  pound and shit you know I got to turn that shit with with Spence and Maddie
[15:19.990 --> 15:23.070]  they taught you how to trim is that what pretty much springboarded you into
[15:23.070 --> 15:32.150]  growing uh it was really it was really just I needed something to have that I
[15:32.150 --> 15:37.750]  could be proud of and look forward to and involve myself in and keep my mind
[15:37.750 --> 15:43.670]  functioning and have goals and objectives with it and you know as
[15:43.670 --> 15:47.790]  somebody that smokes growing has always been a dream like I wish I could try to
[15:47.790 --> 15:52.830]  do this and see what happens so as soon as a dream is presented you have to take
[15:52.830 --> 15:59.550]  it if you don't take it you're a lame like cannabis is his anti-crime guys and
[15:59.710 --> 16:04.790]  I remember yo it is it is cannabis helps me in so many ways without cannabis I
[16:04.790 --> 16:09.990]  don't know if I would have and failure without cannabis and failure I don't
[16:09.990 --> 16:13.430]  think I would be the person that I am today what's been your biggest failure
[16:13.430 --> 16:22.550]  at growing cannabis Oh um might oh yeah fucking the mites man like not thoroughly
[16:22.550 --> 16:27.350]  checking clones from from people and stuff like that and then not being on
[16:27.350 --> 16:32.230]  top of sprays and then just mites being a persistent little fucks yeah I don't
[16:32.230 --> 16:35.910]  like but you won't do that again will you know no it's beautiful in there
[16:35.910 --> 16:41.350]  right now um I can remember my first harvest my first harvest honestly blew
[16:41.350 --> 16:48.750]  my mind I had no sign that yo I very you know very good first grow yeah I first
[16:48.750 --> 16:55.070]  time I've ever grown anything and I black cherry camp shout out to Irie that

[17:43.430 --> 17:48.150]  could come here or really you could just start doing stuff to make it legal where
[17:48.150 --> 17:52.110]  you are that's what I keep telling people to do yeah yeah so you don't have
[17:52.110 --> 17:56.910]  to move stand up for your state like I mean it's not gonna happen everywhere

[26:15.010 --> 26:21.890]  bag we got furniture to make us like a little portable battery solar solar
[26:21.890 --> 26:28.330]  panel book bag email book bag email wave of the future I want one for the car but
[26:28.330 --> 26:32.770]  I foresee a lot of arm burns yo and and the thing with the car is you could have
[26:32.770 --> 26:37.570]  the quick D attachment so it just looks like a breathalyzer so if the cop pulls
[26:37.570 --> 26:41.330]  you over he's by all those guys you know I chilled out in the car on the dabs in
[26:41.330 --> 26:45.010]  the car the periscope in the car the fucking speeding in the car because I
[26:45.010 --> 26:49.290]  got pulled over that's a good call once is enough you know I got I got off like
[26:49.290 --> 26:53.970]  fucking scot-free I'm a six foot five dreadlocked Rasta man that my car smelled
[26:53.970 --> 26:59.530]  like skunky cushy dinky madness and that cop had no problem with it and he let me
[26:59.530 --> 27:03.490]  go so I'm just gonna take one for the team and chill out in the car a little
[27:03.490 --> 27:07.450]  bit the beauty of Colorado yes where else does that happen he smelled my
[27:07.450 --> 27:10.690]  breath and when he realized there was no alcohol in my breath he let me go I had
[27:10.690 --> 27:13.770]  actually eaten a chocolate-covered jalapeno just moments before he pulled
[27:13.770 --> 27:17.890]  me over so when he smelled my breath he made this wrinkled up face like oh god
[27:17.890 --> 27:21.970]  yeah he knew I wasn't drinking I think it's all about how you handle those
[27:21.970 --> 27:27.130]  situations yeah yo even even if you don't like them which you really have
[27:27.130 --> 27:31.170]  no reason not to they got to do their job to just be their best fucking friend
