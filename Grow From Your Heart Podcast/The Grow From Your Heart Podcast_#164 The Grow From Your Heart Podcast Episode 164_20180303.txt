[00:01.210 --> 00:24.210]  It's time for episode number 164 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:24.210 --> 00:26.070]  news, education and conversation.
[00:26.070 --> 00:30.070]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:30.070 --> 00:34.070]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.070 --> 00:39.110]  about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.110 --> 00:40.710]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.710 --> 00:42.910]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.910 --> 00:46.270]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:46.270 --> 00:49.230]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.230 --> 00:52.670]  Big shout to Kat, Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:52.670 --> 00:56.470]  Yeah, I'm doing a solo episode today, you guys.
[00:56.470 --> 01:00.070]  We're going to go over some emails, we're going to go over some iTunes comments, and
[01:00.070 --> 01:04.270]  then if we have some time at the end of the show, I will give a few grow tips and tricks.
[01:04.270 --> 01:06.630]  I want to thank everybody that sent me emails.
[01:06.630 --> 01:10.110]  I also want to thank everybody that went to iTunes and left an iTunes comment.
[01:10.110 --> 01:11.110]  Let's just get right to it.
[01:11.310 --> 01:12.310]  Oh, can't do it.
[01:12.310 --> 01:13.710]  Before we get that far, I got to do this.

[01:48.650 --> 01:51.690]  I appreciate it when people leave me ratings and reviews on iTunes.
[01:51.690 --> 01:56.090]  If you'd like to leave a rating and a review on iTunes, all you have to do is open up iTunes,
[01:56.090 --> 01:59.970]  go to the iTunes store, type in the Grow From Your Heart podcast in the search bar.
[01:59.970 --> 02:01.850]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:01.850 --> 02:03.130]  Find the podcast.
[02:03.130 --> 02:04.130]  Click on the little logo.
[02:04.130 --> 02:05.730]  It's my face and it says Grow From Your Heart.
[02:05.730 --> 02:06.730]  Click on that.
[02:06.730 --> 02:09.610]  Then you'll go to the ratings and reviews section.
[02:10.410 --> 02:12.570]  There's an area where you can give me an amount of stars.
[02:12.570 --> 02:15.050]  Everybody so far has given me a five-star review.
[02:15.050 --> 02:17.730]  I've got 36 five-star reviews, you guys.
[02:17.730 --> 02:19.890]  Nothing but five stars so far.
[02:19.890 --> 02:23.090]  Then 31 people have typed in a written review.
[02:23.090 --> 02:25.290]  I'm pulling up the most recent reviews right now.
[02:25.290 --> 02:27.050]  We will read them.
[02:27.050 --> 02:28.890]  This one, I think we already read that one, right?
[02:28.890 --> 02:29.890]  Let's see.
[02:29.890 --> 02:30.890]  Yes, we already read that one.
[02:30.890 --> 02:32.970]  We will start with this one from Alaskan Pure Organics.
[02:32.970 --> 02:35.610]  Let me turn on the music just a little bit here.
[02:35.610 --> 02:39.010]  This iTunes review comes from our friend Alaskan Pure Organics.
[02:39.010 --> 02:40.690]  It says, it was left on September 15th.
[02:40.690 --> 02:44.090]  It says, I listen to every show, informative and great guests.
[02:44.090 --> 02:47.410]  It's become my favorite show about cannabis.
[02:47.410 --> 02:48.490]  That's an honor.
[02:48.490 --> 02:51.650]  There are some other great podcasts out there about cannabis.
[02:51.650 --> 02:53.770]  I appreciate hearing that I'm your favorite.
[02:53.770 --> 02:56.970]  Big thanks for the email and huge thanks for the five-star rating.
[02:56.970 --> 02:58.690]  I appreciate it.
[02:58.690 --> 03:03.530]  Our next review comes from a listener who calls themselves Akasuki Leader.
[03:03.530 --> 03:05.610]  They left the review on October 1st.
[03:05.610 --> 03:07.330]  They gave me, of course, a five-star review.
[03:07.330 --> 03:08.330]  It goes like this.
[03:08.330 --> 03:10.530]  To Jeff, keep up the fantastic work.
[03:10.530 --> 03:12.090]  I just listened to your podcast.
[03:12.090 --> 03:16.010]  Oh, I started listening to your podcast sometime about four to five months ago.
[03:16.010 --> 03:20.010]  The information, humor, and love that you put into this podcast is unparalleled.
[03:20.010 --> 03:22.610]  I look forward to many more episodes, brother.
[03:22.610 --> 03:25.490]  I'm going to put out a whole bunch more episodes, so stick around.
[03:25.490 --> 03:26.890]  I'm glad you appreciate it.
[03:26.890 --> 03:27.890]  Man, thanks for listening.
[03:27.890 --> 03:31.370]  You've been around for four or five months, probably close to six months now, right?
[03:31.370 --> 03:33.610]  It's been a month since you left this review.
[03:33.610 --> 03:34.610]  Thanks for hanging out.
[03:34.610 --> 03:35.850]  Thanks for listening.
[03:35.850 --> 03:38.450]  Anybody else that would like to leave a review, please do so.
[03:38.450 --> 03:39.450]  Like I said, just go to iTunes.
[03:39.450 --> 03:40.450]  Go to the iTunes store.
[03:40.450 --> 03:42.490]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:42.490 --> 03:43.490]  Find the review section.
[03:43.490 --> 03:45.850]  Type in a little comment and let me know what you think about the show.
[03:45.850 --> 03:48.090]  I will read your review on a future episode.
[03:48.090 --> 03:53.210]  Once again, big shout out to Akasuki Leader and Alaskan Pure Organics.
[03:53.210 --> 03:55.570]  I do appreciate the reviews.
[03:55.570 --> 04:00.090]  The next thing on my agenda, ladies and gentlemen, I want to read some emails from a few listeners.
[04:00.090 --> 04:02.330]  I'm searching for that email now.
[04:02.330 --> 04:03.330]  There we go.
[04:03.330 --> 04:05.330]  All right, this listener, I don't know if this person wants me to say their name, so
[04:05.810 --> 04:09.770]  I'm going to skip that, but it says, Rasta Jeff, your podcast is so much fun.
[04:09.770 --> 04:14.550]  You are really entertaining, truly so much fun to listen to, truly so much fun to listen
[04:14.550 --> 04:15.850]  to you host.
[04:15.850 --> 04:17.650]  Your growing lessons are on point.
[04:17.650 --> 04:23.530]  Hearing you listen to JRE, I knew right away this podcast was going to be awesome.
[04:23.530 --> 04:25.910]  I'm going to fuck with I read genetics forever.
[04:25.910 --> 04:29.770]  I'm growing legal cannabis for myself in SoCal, and I want to know how I can listen to your
[04:29.770 --> 04:32.090]  first 50 episodes.
[04:32.090 --> 04:34.730]  Other than that, I really wanted to give thanks for what you're doing.
[04:35.130 --> 04:39.130]  I appreciate you for the email.
[04:39.130 --> 04:40.130]  I appreciate you for listening.
[04:40.130 --> 04:43.330]  Yes, I am a huge, they said JRE, that's Joe Rogan Experience.
[04:43.330 --> 04:45.450]  I'm a huge Joe Rogan Experience fan.
[04:45.450 --> 04:46.810]  I never skip an episode.
[04:46.810 --> 04:49.330]  I listen to almost every episode as soon as it comes out.
[04:49.330 --> 04:53.570]  That's probably my favorite podcast, followed by the Church of What's Happening Now with
[04:53.570 --> 04:54.570]  Uncle Joey.
[04:54.570 --> 04:59.810]  To be honest with you, Doug Loves Movies with Doug Benson is probably my favorite podcast.
[04:59.810 --> 05:01.970]  Those are my top three.
[05:01.970 --> 05:02.970]  Let's see.
[05:02.970 --> 05:03.970]  You also say my grow lessons are on point.
[05:04.210 --> 05:05.210]  Thank you.
[05:05.210 --> 05:08.210]  I spend a lot of time trying to create grow lessons that are useful for you guys.
[05:08.210 --> 05:10.610]  That's why I like it when the listeners send me emails.
[05:10.610 --> 05:14.930]  I like creating content that is generated from questions from listeners.
[05:14.930 --> 05:16.490]  So I'm glad you appreciate the grow lessons.
[05:16.490 --> 05:18.770]  I'm glad you find them to be on point.
[05:18.770 --> 05:20.330]  You're going to fuck with I read genetics forever.
[05:20.330 --> 05:21.330]  That is awesome.
[05:21.330 --> 05:23.650]  I hope you've got some I read genetics in your garden.
[05:23.650 --> 05:26.390]  If not, we need to figure out how to make that happen for you.
[05:26.390 --> 05:29.130]  You're growing legally in SoCal, so that's rad.
[05:29.130 --> 05:31.090]  We definitely need to get some I read genetics in your hands.
[05:31.090 --> 05:32.490]  I want to know what you're growing out there.
[05:32.490 --> 05:35.610]  I also want to know what part of SoCal you're in because that's where I'm from.
[05:35.610 --> 05:38.490]  I actually grew up in Bellflower, California.
[05:38.490 --> 05:42.050]  I went to Bellflower High School for middle school, and then I moved to Colorado in the
[05:42.050 --> 05:43.050]  middle of ninth grade.
[05:43.050 --> 05:45.050]  So I'm from SoCal also.
[05:45.050 --> 05:47.410]  A lot of people call me out like, what part of California are you from?
[05:47.410 --> 05:48.730]  I'm like, what are you even talking about?
[05:48.730 --> 05:52.410]  They say that the clothes I wear and the way that I am, they can tell I'm from California.
[05:52.410 --> 05:54.330]  I've been called out a few times.
[05:54.330 --> 05:59.030]  So then you also say you want to listen to the first 50 episodes.
[05:59.030 --> 06:02.050]  Most of the feeds apparently don't have the first 50 episodes because I'm all the way
[06:02.610 --> 06:03.610]  up to 160.
[06:03.610 --> 06:05.110]  This is going to be 164.
[06:05.110 --> 06:08.610]  So it looks like the last 64 episodes are getting bumped out of the feed.
[06:08.610 --> 06:11.850]  What I've been talking about doing is going and finding those old episodes.
[06:11.850 --> 06:12.850]  They're in my computer.
[06:12.850 --> 06:14.650]  They're on my drive over there.
[06:14.650 --> 06:16.610]  I just need to plug that in and find the old episodes.
[06:16.610 --> 06:18.490]  They're probably on my web server still.
[06:18.490 --> 06:20.570]  I just repost them.
[06:20.570 --> 06:24.330]  And then I don't know if I want to go back and edit them at all and be like, hey, what's
[06:24.330 --> 06:25.330]  up?
[06:25.330 --> 06:28.730]  This is a repost or if I just want to repost it and put it in the feed as a bonus episode.
[06:28.730 --> 06:30.190]  But that's probably the best way to do it.
[06:30.190 --> 06:33.310]  If you really want them super bad, send me an email.
[06:33.310 --> 06:36.830]  If you guys are like dying to hear the first 64 episodes or something, send me an email.
[06:36.830 --> 06:41.510]  Maybe we can work out a way where I can send you the files through WeTransfer or Dropbox
[06:41.510 --> 06:42.510]  or something.
[06:42.510 --> 06:43.510]  We'll get it going.
[06:43.510 --> 06:46.990]  But I may just throw in the first episode, the first 50 episodes back in the feed, like
[06:46.990 --> 06:48.670]  every five or six episodes or something.
[06:48.670 --> 06:51.390]  Just put another one in there so that you guys can go listen to the old stuff.
[06:51.390 --> 06:54.950]  And that'll also be a fun exercise in seeing how much we've progressed because you'll be
[06:54.950 --> 06:57.230]  able to spot the old episodes right away.
[06:57.230 --> 07:00.430]  So I may have to put the old episodes back in the feed.
[07:00.430 --> 07:03.630]  And maybe if you send me an email and you ask really nicely for a few episodes, I can't
[07:03.630 --> 07:04.630]  send you all 50 at once.
[07:04.630 --> 07:05.990]  That's going to blow up my computer.
[07:05.990 --> 07:09.590]  But if you ask me for a few episodes at a time, maybe I can send you a few at a time.
[07:09.590 --> 07:13.430]  Maybe put me maybe we can make a list or something, a few people, and then I can just dump all
[07:13.430 --> 07:17.350]  the episodes to a few people, like five at a time or something, five a week, something
[07:17.350 --> 07:18.350]  like that.
[07:18.350 --> 07:19.350]  I'd love to help you out, though.
[07:19.350 --> 07:20.350]  We'll get it going for you.
[07:20.350 --> 07:22.270]  Email me back if you want them as a file.
[07:22.270 --> 07:24.950]  Anybody that's listening, if you want the first 50, we can figure something out.
[07:24.950 --> 07:25.950]  Send me an email.
[07:25.950 --> 07:26.950]  Let's see if people are interested.
[07:26.950 --> 07:27.950]  We'll figure something.
[07:27.950 --> 07:28.950]  All right.
[07:28.950 --> 07:29.950]  Thanks for the email.
[07:29.950 --> 07:30.950]  I appreciate it.
[07:30.950 --> 07:32.750]  Let's get on to the next email.
[07:32.750 --> 07:37.270]  This one is from a very frequent listener, somebody that I interact with on Twitter,
[07:37.270 --> 07:38.870]  somebody that's been a longtime listener.
[07:38.870 --> 07:42.070]  I truly appreciate you for hanging out so long with us.
[07:42.070 --> 07:45.230]  This one, I could probably say your name because you use your Instagram and Twitter handle.
[07:45.230 --> 07:48.030]  This is our friend FastBerry.
[07:48.030 --> 07:49.950]  FastBerry says, hello, Jeff.
[07:49.950 --> 07:50.950]  Thanks for the podcast.
[07:50.950 --> 07:53.190]  I enjoy hearing your curing episodes.
[07:53.190 --> 07:56.870]  Your drying and curing method is almost exactly the way I do it.
[07:56.870 --> 07:57.870]  Word.
[07:57.870 --> 07:58.870]  Nice.
[07:58.870 --> 08:00.870]  It's good to know that people out there are doing the things that I'm doing.
[08:00.870 --> 08:03.950]  It's good to know that other people have the same ideas that I do and are working with
[08:03.950 --> 08:04.950]  the same methods.
[08:04.950 --> 08:07.450]  A little affirmation is always a good thing.
[08:07.450 --> 08:11.750]  You also say, I would add that I trim dry my plants on a piece of parchment paper so
[08:11.750 --> 08:16.510]  I can collect the resin heads off that fall later when I clean up.
[08:16.510 --> 08:17.510]  That's a really good idea.
[08:17.510 --> 08:22.310]  You guys, when you're about to trim your buds, put down ... What did he say that he added
[08:22.430 --> 08:23.590]  some parchment paper?
[08:23.590 --> 08:27.590]  Put down a sheet of parchment paper over the table and then trim onto the parchment paper.
[08:27.590 --> 08:30.390]  Then when you're done, you can clean up all the keef that came off of there.
[08:30.390 --> 08:32.590]  You're going to have a bunch of resin heads on there.
[08:32.590 --> 08:36.670]  You can either put those in a bowl and smoke them, or if you're really into it, you can
[08:36.670 --> 08:39.670]  press them if you know how to make rosin.
[08:39.670 --> 08:40.670]  That's something that's useful.
[08:40.670 --> 08:41.670]  That's a good idea.
[08:41.670 --> 08:43.390]  Thanks for the heads up on that one, FastBerry.
[08:43.390 --> 08:49.830]  He also continues, he says, I have a full-time job, so no time for excessive burping of jars,
[08:49.830 --> 08:55.790]  but I do put the lids on upside down, metal to glass, and loosely screw on the cap.
[08:55.790 --> 08:59.430]  You guys, instead of sealing the cap the normal way where it's got the waxy seal against the
[08:59.430 --> 09:03.630]  glass and then you put the lid on real tight, he flips it upside down and puts the metal
[09:03.630 --> 09:07.710]  to glass on there so it's not making a super tight seal.
[09:07.710 --> 09:12.230]  He only screws it on medium tight, apparently, loosely screws on the cap.
[09:12.230 --> 09:16.070]  He says it allows some air exchange, but it prevents buds from drying out.
[09:16.070 --> 09:18.430]  I do that for 48 hours.
[09:18.430 --> 09:22.830]  Then I start the 12-hour check, burp, and will repeat as needed.
[09:22.830 --> 09:24.590]  Then daily, then weekly, blah, blah, blah.
[09:24.590 --> 09:26.710]  He said, you know you just did the episode.
[09:26.710 --> 09:29.590]  Thanks, FastBerry on Instagram and Twitter.
[09:29.590 --> 09:34.070]  You guys, if you go follow my friend FastBerry on Instagram and or Twitter, make sure you
[09:34.070 --> 09:37.470]  let him know that you heard his email on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[09:37.470 --> 09:39.470]  Shout out, FastBerry.
[09:39.470 --> 09:40.950]  It's good to know that other people are doing that.
[09:40.950 --> 09:44.390]  You guys, that's a great update and a great addition to what I said.
[09:44.390 --> 09:48.830]  If you have a full-time job, if you can't dedicate 24 hours a day to your grow, which
[09:48.830 --> 09:51.190]  is understandable, I'm not calling you out.
[09:51.190 --> 09:54.030]  Most people have a normal job and they grow in their spare time.
[09:54.030 --> 09:59.790]  If this is you and you can't check those jars, if you've got to go to work, for a long time,
[09:59.790 --> 10:04.230]  for like a year, I lived 55 miles away from where I work.
[10:04.230 --> 10:09.070]  Take me one hour to get to work, then I would be at work for 8 to 12 hours, maybe 14 hours
[10:09.070 --> 10:10.070]  on some days.
[10:10.070 --> 10:11.070]  Then there's another drive home.
[10:11.070 --> 10:13.110]  Then you got to do whatever you do when you get home.
[10:13.110 --> 10:15.910]  You got to eat, you got to poop, you got to shower, you got to put on clothes for the
[10:15.910 --> 10:16.910]  next day.
[10:16.910 --> 10:19.110]  You got to get all that shit going.
[10:19.110 --> 10:23.630]  Of course, that limited me to maybe four or five hours of time that I was able to work
[10:23.630 --> 10:24.630]  on my garden at home.
[10:24.630 --> 10:25.870]  I totally understand that.
[10:25.870 --> 10:27.910]  A lot of people are in that situation.
[10:27.910 --> 10:32.030]  You guys can put your buds in these jars and you can leave the lids on upside down and
[10:32.030 --> 10:35.750]  loose and you'll get some airflow in there and you'll still slowly dry the buds because
[10:35.750 --> 10:39.870]  that's your main objective is to slowly and evenly dry these buds.
[10:39.870 --> 10:40.870]  All right.
[10:40.870 --> 10:42.990]  FastBerry, I appreciate the email.
[10:43.870 --> 10:44.870]  You guys keep the emails coming.
[10:44.870 --> 10:45.870]  That is super helpful.
[10:45.870 --> 10:48.750]  I've got one more email that is actually a correction.
[10:48.750 --> 10:53.990]  I said something in an episode about THCA converting to THC, but guess what?
[10:53.990 --> 10:54.990]  I was wrong.
[10:54.990 --> 10:56.430]  I said that shit backwards.
[10:56.430 --> 10:58.110]  Let me read an email.
[10:58.110 --> 10:59.150]  He says his name in the email.
[10:59.150 --> 11:00.150]  I'm going to skip it.
[11:00.150 --> 11:03.590]  He says, hey, brother, my name is Beep and I've been listening to your podcast since
[11:03.590 --> 11:07.350]  I heard an episode on Tok Radio earlier on in the year.
[11:07.350 --> 11:08.790]  Big shout out to our friends at Tok Radio.
[11:08.790 --> 11:12.630]  Big shout out to Citizen J. Of course, you can listen to our podcast Wednesday.
[11:13.270 --> 11:14.270]  I don't know the correct day.
[11:14.270 --> 11:15.270]  Wednesday's at noon?
[11:15.270 --> 11:17.910]  I think it's Wednesday at noon on TokRadio.com.
[11:17.910 --> 11:19.750]  I will correct that by the end of this episode.
[11:19.750 --> 11:21.390]  I will make sure I've got the right time and date.
[11:21.390 --> 11:23.390]  There's a lot of shit in my head right now.
[11:23.390 --> 11:25.110]  Anyway, he listens to me on Tok Radio.
[11:25.110 --> 11:26.110]  I appreciate that.
[11:26.110 --> 11:29.510]  He said, I'm a huge fan of the podcast, your grow techniques, your advice, and your Irie
[11:29.510 --> 11:30.990]  Rasta way of life.
[11:30.990 --> 11:34.870]  I'm an aspiring cannabis enthusiast myself and I'm working on getting my foot in the
[11:34.870 --> 11:38.270]  door of the cannabis industry here in Connecticut.
[11:38.270 --> 11:42.210]  For the past few years, I've been learning as much about cannabis as I can before I enter
[11:42.790 --> 11:46.730]  either the medical or recreational side of the industry when we establish a rec site,
[11:46.730 --> 11:47.730]  that is.
[11:47.730 --> 11:52.410]  I have to thank you, your friends, and your podcast for supplying me with a massive amount
[11:52.410 --> 11:55.410]  of cannabis information and grow tips.
[11:55.410 --> 11:56.610]  Dude, that's a huge compliment.
[11:56.610 --> 12:00.170]  I hope that our podcast has put you on the right path to where when you're able to get
[12:00.170 --> 12:02.570]  into a facility, you could be a leader.
[12:02.570 --> 12:05.670]  Maybe you could be one of the bosses, the cultivation directors.
[12:05.670 --> 12:08.850]  Maybe since it's new, maybe you can just invent the phrase.
[12:08.850 --> 12:10.290]  You're like, I'm cultivation director.
[12:10.290 --> 12:11.290]  Tell them so and do that.
[12:11.370 --> 12:14.850]  I hope we can get you your foot in the door when the time comes.
[12:14.850 --> 12:15.850]  Connecticut, huh?
[12:15.850 --> 12:17.690]  I don't think I've ever been to Connecticut.
[12:17.690 --> 12:22.050]  I've been to a lot of places and I cannot remember ever going to Connecticut for any
[12:22.050 --> 12:23.050]  reason.
[12:23.050 --> 12:25.250]  I don't think, no, no.
[12:25.250 --> 12:27.970]  Fish would be the only thing that would take me that direction and I've never seen fish
[12:27.970 --> 12:30.530]  in Connecticut, so I remember that.
[12:30.530 --> 12:31.530]  Let's see.
[12:31.530 --> 12:32.530]  I'm going to continue with the email.
[12:32.530 --> 12:35.770]  He says, on a separate note, in the episode you put out this morning, you asked to correct
[12:35.770 --> 12:39.330]  you if you got the THC-THCA conversion wrong.
[12:39.330 --> 12:43.970]  From what I remember, the THC is what the trichomes start off as and they transform
[12:43.970 --> 12:47.530]  into THC when heating through decarboxylation.
[12:47.530 --> 12:51.410]  Through curing, most likely increases the psychoactive potency of the trichome since
[12:51.410 --> 12:52.410]  THC decarboxylates.
[12:52.410 --> 12:55.970]  Sorry, I got to spin the page.
[12:55.970 --> 12:59.930]  Since THC carboxylates, where am I now?
[12:59.930 --> 13:01.170]  In the form of water vapor.
[13:01.170 --> 13:02.770]  Let me know if that was the solid knowledge.
[13:02.770 --> 13:04.530]  Man, I'm not a scientist.
[13:04.530 --> 13:07.190]  I hope the rest of your day is iry, brother.
[13:07.190 --> 13:09.750]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[13:09.750 --> 13:11.710]  Dude, you are totally correct.
[13:11.710 --> 13:14.750]  What you said is completely correct, so thanks for the correction.
[13:14.750 --> 13:16.350]  Guys, don't be afraid to correct me.
[13:16.350 --> 13:20.630]  If I say something stupid on the podcast, if I say something wrong, please send me an
[13:20.630 --> 13:24.230]  email and let me know that I've done fucked up because it's the only way that I can correct
[13:24.230 --> 13:26.790]  it and I don't want to teach people the wrong way.
[13:26.790 --> 13:29.770]  That's a big part of why I started this podcast, you guys.
[13:29.770 --> 13:33.110]  I would be on the forums, I'd be on the internet, I'd be in Facebook groups, and then I would
[13:33.110 --> 13:35.390]  see people give the shittiest advice.
[13:35.390 --> 13:38.750]  People would be like, I'm in week five in flower and I've got spider mites, what do
[13:38.750 --> 13:39.750]  I do?
[13:39.750 --> 13:41.750]  Somebody would be like, go in there and spray fluoromite.
[13:41.750 --> 13:43.150]  I would just cringe.
[13:43.150 --> 13:45.470]  I just now slapped myself in the face when I read that.
[13:45.470 --> 13:46.470]  I was like, oh shit.
[13:46.470 --> 13:49.710]  I just did the Macaulay Culkin like, no.
[13:49.710 --> 13:53.990]  That's part of what inspired me to do this podcast, was trying not to pass along fake
[13:53.990 --> 13:58.790]  information and try to give useful information from experience.
[13:58.790 --> 14:00.950]  I'm kind of a crazy grower.
[14:00.950 --> 14:05.230]  If I have an idea and I think that something might improve my crop, the only way to find
[14:05.230 --> 14:07.470]  out if it's going to improve it is to do it.
[14:07.470 --> 14:11.310]  I figure I've been growing long enough to where I've got a good foundation.
[14:11.310 --> 14:12.930]  I can skateboard, I cannot skateboard.
[14:12.930 --> 14:13.930]  This is an analogy.
[14:13.930 --> 14:14.990]  I can skateboard real well.
[14:14.990 --> 14:16.430]  It's time to hit the half pipe.
[14:16.430 --> 14:18.350]  Sometimes I'll go in the grow room and do half pipe tricks.
[14:18.350 --> 14:21.030]  I'll be like, what if I just totally do this?
[14:21.030 --> 14:24.790]  Occasionally I fuck up and kill plants, you guys, but that's all part of learning and
[14:24.790 --> 14:25.790]  experimenting.
[14:25.790 --> 14:27.350]  All right, I'm way sidetracked.
[14:27.350 --> 14:29.030]  I'm way off my topic.
[14:29.030 --> 14:31.590]  If I do something wrong, if I say something wrong, please do correct me.
[14:31.590 --> 14:32.910]  Jesse corrected me a couple of times.
[14:32.910 --> 14:35.870]  Actually Jesse's dad told Jesse to come and correct me.
[14:35.870 --> 14:37.670]  So shout out to Jay and Jesse.
[14:37.670 --> 14:40.470]  Shout out to anybody else who's ever sent me a correction.
[14:40.470 --> 14:41.470]  Don't be afraid.
[14:41.470 --> 14:42.470]  I like being corrected.
[14:42.470 --> 14:43.470]  It makes me a better podcaster.
[14:43.470 --> 14:46.390]  It makes me a better grower and it makes me a better teacher and it humbles me.
[14:46.390 --> 14:47.390]  So help me out and do that.
[14:47.390 --> 14:49.430]  All right, you guys, I want to appreciate, I want to appreciate.
[14:49.430 --> 14:50.430]  I already do appreciate you.
[14:50.430 --> 14:51.990]  I want to thank everybody who sent me an email.
[14:51.990 --> 14:54.430]  I want to thank everybody who sent me an iTunes comment.
[14:54.430 --> 14:56.390]  I do have a shit ton more emails, you guys.
[14:56.390 --> 15:00.590]  I'm not ignoring the emails, the Facebook messages, the Instagram messages that I've
[15:00.590 --> 15:01.590]  got.
[15:01.590 --> 15:03.550]  There are so many of them, but I picked a few for this episode.
[15:03.550 --> 15:05.510]  I'll do a few more in the next couple of episodes.
[15:05.510 --> 15:06.510]  All right.
[15:06.510 --> 15:08.350]  I feel like I'm talking really fast, you guys.
[15:08.350 --> 15:11.790]  I could probably use a drink of water and of course I need a big fat dab.
[15:11.790 --> 15:12.790]  So I'm just going to press pause.
[15:12.790 --> 15:14.190]  I'm going to medicate myself.
[15:14.190 --> 15:17.990]  I'm going to hydrate myself and I'll be back in just a couple of seconds.
[15:17.990 --> 15:23.730]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[15:23.730 --> 15:28.770]  I just took a couple of fat dabs of some Jack Flash Shatter from our friends at TR
[15:28.770 --> 15:29.770]  Concentrates.
[15:29.770 --> 15:30.770]  Super shattery.
[15:30.770 --> 15:33.970]  It's kind of like the, I said this before on a previous episode, it's kind of like the
[15:33.970 --> 15:36.170]  consistency of a Jolly Rancher.
[15:36.170 --> 15:39.490]  If you tried to break Jolly Ranchers with your fingers, it would just go popping and
[15:39.490 --> 15:40.490]  flying everywhere.
[15:40.490 --> 15:45.530]  It's kind of that hard consistency, that hard texture, but it tastes really good and obviously
[15:45.530 --> 15:49.410]  it gets me really rambly high because I've been freaking talking a million miles an hour
[15:49.410 --> 15:50.410]  in this episode.
[15:50.410 --> 15:52.850]  I want to thank you guys for listening to my rambles.
[15:52.970 --> 15:56.890]  So I promised you guys some grow tips and grow tricks, but before I get that far, I
[15:56.890 --> 16:00.170]  want to talk about my most recent breeding project.
[16:00.170 --> 16:03.850]  Of course, if you listen to the podcast, you know I made some Arise F2s.
[16:03.850 --> 16:07.210]  I also crossed Arise F1 to Lemon Skunk.
[16:07.210 --> 16:08.570]  All of those seeds have been harvested.
[16:08.570 --> 16:10.330]  They've all been dried out properly.
[16:10.330 --> 16:11.810]  They're all in jars.
[16:11.810 --> 16:14.850]  Our friend Jesse was given a few of those the last time he was here.
[16:14.850 --> 16:18.130]  Barefoot Grower was given a few of those when he was here for the podcast.
[16:18.130 --> 16:19.610]  So some of those have gone out.
[16:19.930 --> 16:25.210]  I'm working some of the new seeds into my grow schedule so that I can grow some of those.
[16:25.210 --> 16:29.850]  I really want to know what the Arise F2 does, but I really want to know what that Arise
[16:29.850 --> 16:34.650]  to Lemon Skunk is going to do for me because everything I've crossed my Lemon Skunk female,
[16:34.650 --> 16:36.410]  everything has been amazing.
[16:36.410 --> 16:38.770]  I also did Arise to Grateful Dog.
[16:38.770 --> 16:40.050]  I'm super curious about that.
[16:40.050 --> 16:42.530]  That one will probably not be released for a while.
[16:42.530 --> 16:45.730]  I want to play with that one for a little bit by myself and then I'll put it out in
[16:45.730 --> 16:46.730]  seed farm.
[16:46.730 --> 16:47.730]  I have to make more of it.
[16:47.730 --> 16:49.730]  I only have a small handful of seeds of that one.
[16:49.730 --> 16:52.730]  The others I have a lot of seeds, so they'll go out.
[16:52.730 --> 16:55.450]  So my new breeding project, ladies and gentlemen, let me talk more about that.
[16:55.450 --> 16:57.170]  I am using the same Arise male.
[16:57.170 --> 16:58.610]  I've got an Arise male.
[16:58.610 --> 16:59.610]  He is a stud.
[16:59.610 --> 17:02.290]  If you follow me on Instagram, you have seen this dude on Instagram.
[17:02.290 --> 17:03.850]  He grows for a male plant.
[17:03.850 --> 17:08.050]  He grows some of the biggest colas, the biggest male flowers I've ever seen.
[17:08.050 --> 17:09.050]  He puts resin out.
[17:09.050 --> 17:10.290]  He smells terrible.
[17:10.290 --> 17:14.690]  He's got this really funky stank to him, which is a good thing for a male.
[17:14.690 --> 17:21.610]  Arise is Golden Goat was the female and Daybreaker from Gage Green Genetics was the male.
[17:21.610 --> 17:25.490]  Daybreaker is Chem D and Joseph OG.
[17:25.490 --> 17:30.250]  So those are the ones that the Joseph OG, Chem D crossed to Golden Goat, which is Island
[17:30.250 --> 17:32.930]  Sweet Skunk, Hawaiian Sativa and Romulan.
[17:32.930 --> 17:35.650]  So it's such a good combo.
[17:35.650 --> 17:36.650]  Arise is a great strain.
[17:36.650 --> 17:41.610]  I took the male and now the males are in flower.
[17:41.610 --> 17:44.930]  This podcast won't go out for quite some time, but the males are now in flower.
[17:44.930 --> 17:51.470]  They went into flower yesterday and I've got two huts with other plants in them, two five
[17:51.470 --> 17:56.490]  by five huts with two gallon pots and the huts are crammed pretty tight.
[17:56.490 --> 18:01.330]  There's two gallon pots, stuff in those huts and there are cookies and cream females, cookies
[18:01.330 --> 18:03.430]  and cream females, white widow females.
[18:03.430 --> 18:05.110]  There's lemon skunk females.
[18:05.110 --> 18:07.370]  There's a lemon Jeffrey in there.
[18:07.370 --> 18:10.970]  There is, there are a couple others in there that I don't even need to mention yet, but
[18:10.970 --> 18:12.610]  we'll talk about those later in the future.
[18:12.610 --> 18:18.490]  Those are probably going to go into flower maybe Monday, but anyway, pretty soon those
[18:18.490 --> 18:19.490]  are going to go into flower here.
[18:19.490 --> 18:22.870]  I'm letting, I need the male to get ahead just a little tiny bit, but I don't want my
[18:22.870 --> 18:25.290]  girls to get too big and they're starting to kind of get tall.
[18:25.290 --> 18:28.850]  So I need to, I need to time this out just right, but I'm going to keep the male separate.
[18:28.850 --> 18:30.690]  I'm going to let him flower out.
[18:30.690 --> 18:32.010]  There are two male plants.
[18:32.010 --> 18:34.810]  It's the same strain, but I just need enough pollen to do two huts.
[18:34.810 --> 18:36.890]  So I've got two male plants in there.
[18:36.890 --> 18:37.890]  They're flowering.
[18:37.890 --> 18:40.570]  I'm going to keep them separate to keep that pollen in there.
[18:40.570 --> 18:45.010]  And then around day 25 ish, depending on how the plants look, I'm going to go and pollinate
[18:45.010 --> 18:47.930]  25 of flower for the girls.
[18:47.930 --> 18:52.010]  I'm going to go in and pollinate both of the five by five huts worth of plants, and then
[18:52.010 --> 18:53.290]  we'll make a bunch of new crosses.
[18:53.290 --> 18:55.450]  So that's what's going on in my breeding projects.
[18:55.450 --> 18:57.370]  I like to keep you guys updated.
[18:57.370 --> 18:58.370]  Some of you guys really care.
[18:58.370 --> 19:00.330]  Some of you guys probably don't care at all.
[19:00.330 --> 19:01.570]  So let's move on to some grow tips.
[19:01.570 --> 19:07.050]  Like I talked about, you guys, I've been talking about growing in cocoa coir a whole bunch.
[19:07.210 --> 19:09.690]  I've experimented with several brands of cocoa.
[19:09.690 --> 19:12.330]  I've experimented with different nutrient feeds in cocoa.
[19:12.330 --> 19:13.530]  I do love cocoa.
[19:13.530 --> 19:15.170]  I love the cocoa.
[19:15.170 --> 19:19.610]  But one thing that sucks is if you don't mix something in with it, it kind of compresses
[19:19.610 --> 19:20.610]  a little bit.
[19:20.610 --> 19:22.370]  It kind of gets to be too much around your roots.
[19:22.370 --> 19:27.850]  And I feel like the plants that I did in all cocoa could have harvested better had I mixed
[19:27.850 --> 19:29.690]  something into that soil.
[19:29.690 --> 19:31.250]  I don't like the cocoa that I used.
[19:31.250 --> 19:34.450]  I think the plants probably could have been a little bit better.
[19:34.450 --> 19:40.250]  So if you're going to grow in cocoa, mix in maybe 50% soil or maybe mix in a whole
[19:40.250 --> 19:41.810]  bunch of perlite.
[19:41.810 --> 19:46.530]  Because I've used a couple brands of cocoa and some of them compress a whole bunch.
[19:46.530 --> 19:47.890]  Some of them don't.
[19:47.890 --> 19:49.850]  And it's hard to tell when they're in the bag.
[19:49.850 --> 19:50.970]  And I'm not going to call out brands.
[19:50.970 --> 19:55.690]  I've just learned that I want to mix my cocoa with some soil and or some perlite.
[19:55.690 --> 19:57.770]  So that's something I would recommend.
[19:57.770 --> 20:00.050]  My babies, my clones, hated going into cocoa.
[20:00.050 --> 20:01.050]  They just died.
[20:01.050 --> 20:02.050]  They were like, no, fuck you.
[20:02.050 --> 20:03.250]  That's too much pressure on the roots.
[20:03.250 --> 20:04.250]  There's no air in here.
[20:05.050 --> 20:06.050]  They were just going to die.
[20:06.050 --> 20:10.050]  And so I mixed some 50-50 with soil and threw it in there and they grew but they weren't
[20:10.050 --> 20:11.050]  happy.
[20:11.050 --> 20:17.010]  And then I put some just into straight soil, a soilless mix that I make for babies that
[20:17.010 --> 20:19.290]  had no cocoa in it and those plants took off.
[20:19.290 --> 20:23.610]  So start your babies in some soil maybe, unless you get them really going.
[20:23.610 --> 20:25.250]  Unless you're coming from Rockwool, then it might work.
[20:25.250 --> 20:27.130]  I'm coming out of the Easy Cloner, of course.
[20:27.130 --> 20:29.130]  This is what happened from the Easy Cloner.
[20:29.130 --> 20:34.290]  So I think soil or a 50-50 mix is better than just straight up cocoa.
[20:34.290 --> 20:38.330]  So that's something I wanted to mention to you guys through experience.
[20:38.330 --> 20:39.330]  Let's see.
[20:39.330 --> 20:42.390]  One of our friends that listens to the podcast was posting on Facebook that he's got a strain
[20:42.390 --> 20:46.950]  that takes a really long time to flower and it's way late into flower already and it does
[20:46.950 --> 20:50.430]  not show any signs of slowing down and being done.
[20:50.430 --> 20:51.990]  And he was just asking questions.
[20:51.990 --> 20:52.990]  You want to know WTF.
[20:52.990 --> 20:55.810]  He's like, what the fuck is going on with this plant, dude?
[20:55.810 --> 21:01.870]  And so my guidance, my advice was to reduce the lights on that plant to speed up the flowering
[21:01.870 --> 21:02.870]  cycle.
[21:02.870 --> 21:06.310]  That plant is waiting for a signal to say, hey, are you done yet?
[21:06.310 --> 21:09.430]  Just waiting for something to hint at it that the season is over.
[21:09.430 --> 21:12.550]  Wherever that plant, it's hard to even guess where that plant came from.
[21:12.550 --> 21:17.510]  I don't know what strain you're working with, but that plant comes from an area where the
[21:17.510 --> 21:26.010]  day and night cycle between the winter and summer seasons does not vary very much.
[21:26.010 --> 21:30.010]  So what it takes to make those plants flower, they're very sensitive.
[21:30.010 --> 21:31.970]  They'll flower very easily.
[21:31.970 --> 21:35.130]  Sometimes those plants, those type of plants, if they get root bound, they'll flower.
[21:35.130 --> 21:38.530]  If they get crowded and they're not getting enough light, they'll flower.
[21:38.530 --> 21:42.130]  So they're cool because they'll start flowering very easily when you're ready.
[21:42.130 --> 21:45.830]  If you put them in the flower room, you'll notice sometimes those will show flower earliest,
[21:45.830 --> 21:47.170]  but also they don't want to finish.
[21:47.830 --> 21:49.670]  So since the season doesn't change, let me get back on track here.
[21:49.670 --> 21:51.470]  My mind is racing today.
[21:51.470 --> 21:54.550]  Since the season doesn't change very much, those plants can pretty much just go on until
[21:54.550 --> 21:57.350]  they wither up and die is what would happen in nature.
[21:57.350 --> 21:58.350]  And that's what they want to do.
[21:58.350 --> 22:00.270]  They're going to keep going until they receive pollen.
[22:00.270 --> 22:02.550]  They're just like, hey, pollinate me, pollinate me, please, please, please.
[22:02.550 --> 22:04.630]  And they're just going to grow until they fry themselves out.
[22:04.630 --> 22:08.910]  So you've got to reduce the lights to give them a hint that, oh shit, grow season's over.
[22:08.910 --> 22:10.430]  I better finish up.
[22:10.430 --> 22:11.430]  And that's what you got to do.
[22:11.430 --> 22:15.750]  Turn the light, if you're on 12, 12, turn the lights down to maybe just give them 10
[22:15.750 --> 22:20.690]  hours of light a day instead of 12, go 10, 14, and just do that for two weeks.
[22:20.690 --> 22:22.370]  And I'm sure they'll start finishing up.
[22:22.370 --> 22:24.690]  They may be finished up in two weeks from doing that.
[22:24.690 --> 22:27.170]  So maybe start flushing, reduce the lights.
[22:27.170 --> 22:31.010]  That's something that will certainly help you with a strain that is taking way too long.
[22:31.010 --> 22:35.130]  I had a Durban poison strain that took like 16 weeks to flower properly.
[22:35.130 --> 22:38.410]  When I started chopping down the lights a little bit, it certainly sped up the time.
[22:38.410 --> 22:43.290]  It cut off two full weeks if I did it two weeks, if I timed it properly.
[22:43.290 --> 22:44.290]  I grew up as a long time ago.
[22:44.290 --> 22:45.950]  I don't even fuck with that Durban poison anymore.
[22:45.950 --> 22:47.350]  It was kind of a mess.
[22:47.350 --> 22:49.790]  No need for that shit in my garden.
[22:49.790 --> 22:51.190]  You may have a good Durban poison cut.
[22:51.190 --> 22:55.630]  No offense to yours, but the one I had, no, I did not want to work with it again.
[22:55.630 --> 22:56.630]  All right.
[22:56.630 --> 23:03.070]  So another thing, everybody got, not everybody, a lot of people got powdery mildew last winter
[23:03.070 --> 23:07.150]  and the winter is coming and I don't want you to get powdery mildew again.
[23:07.150 --> 23:11.790]  So let's talk about some ways that you can prevent powdery mildew that's going to, that
[23:11.790 --> 23:13.490]  possibly happens because it's winter time.
[23:13.490 --> 23:15.850]  You guys, when it gets cold outside and it stays warm inside.
[23:15.850 --> 23:18.090]  So you're growing, growing cannabis indoors, right?
[23:18.090 --> 23:19.090]  A lot of you are in a basement.
[23:19.090 --> 23:21.210]  A lot of you are in a warehouse.
[23:21.210 --> 23:25.250]  You've probably got one concrete wall somewhere that your plants are really close to.
[23:25.250 --> 23:29.850]  The outside of that wall is going to get temperatures that are really ridiculously low.
[23:29.850 --> 23:34.410]  Then on the opposite side of that wall, you've got a beautiful grow environment.
[23:34.410 --> 23:38.250]  So when that moisture builds up on the outside and makes that weird cold wall and then the
[23:38.250 --> 23:41.750]  heat hits it, a lot of, a lot of grow rooms, I see it happen.
[23:41.750 --> 23:42.750]  It's happened to me.
[23:42.750 --> 23:46.030]  The first time I moved into this one house that I grew in this one basement that had
[23:46.030 --> 23:49.310]  a concrete wall, the plant, we've talked about it before, that plant in that corner where
[23:49.310 --> 23:54.070]  the concrete corner was, it got completely powdery mildew all up that one side.
[23:54.070 --> 23:57.470]  I was at another facility that had a garage door type of thing.
[23:57.470 --> 24:01.030]  And right there in that area, those plants started getting powdery mildew on the first
[24:01.030 --> 24:02.030]  snowfall.
[24:02.030 --> 24:05.710]  So something you can do, something you're going to need to think about is how to heat
[24:05.710 --> 24:07.350]  those areas properly.
[24:07.450 --> 24:08.450]  How do you build a separate wall?
[24:08.450 --> 24:13.450]  I know this sounds extreme, but if you've got a wall, if your grow facility has a wall
[24:13.450 --> 24:17.570]  that is on the exterior of the building and it is concrete or it is not well insulated,
[24:17.570 --> 24:21.890]  you may want to build a six inch gap in there and put some insulation in there so that when
[24:21.890 --> 24:26.350]  it snows, you've got a buffer zone so that you're not freezing your plants.
[24:26.350 --> 24:30.370]  Something else you can do to help prevent powdery mildew, and this is just for all seasons.
[24:30.370 --> 24:33.570]  When the plants start going into flower and getting a little bit of chunky buds, I like
[24:33.570 --> 24:37.950]  to go in and take off most of the big fan leaves.
[24:37.950 --> 24:40.310]  Most of those water leaves, the sun leaves, whatever you want to call them.
[24:40.310 --> 24:42.830]  I like to pull the majority of those off.
[24:42.830 --> 24:44.150]  Some people think that I'm crazy.
[24:44.150 --> 24:48.950]  Some people think I'm nuts for doing it, but go in there about week three of flower and
[24:48.950 --> 24:52.390]  take off all those petioles and watch them grow back.
[24:52.390 --> 24:53.910]  You'll freak out because they come back.
[24:53.910 --> 24:55.750]  Your plants will be way more productive.
[24:55.750 --> 24:56.750]  You'll see production.
[24:56.750 --> 25:00.030]  And what you're doing is you're letting the light penetrate a little bit more.
[25:00.030 --> 25:04.490]  You can get light down to the bottom buds to where you don't have to lollipop as high.
[25:04.490 --> 25:06.370]  You're also creating more airspace.
[25:06.370 --> 25:11.130]  At the same time, you're removing places for powdery mildew to land and build up.
[25:11.130 --> 25:15.890]  A lot of times what happens, you guys, in a warm, humid grow room, you've got one leaf
[25:15.890 --> 25:18.530]  and another leaf resting right on top of each other.
[25:18.530 --> 25:23.570]  Now imagine if you're on the bus and the dude next to you just rests his fucking hand right
[25:23.570 --> 25:28.010]  on yours on the bus in the middle of the summer and his hand is sweating and your hand is
[25:28.010 --> 25:31.030]  sweating and you got to ride all day, 12 hours.
[25:31.030 --> 25:34.210]  Yeah, you got fans going on in there, but there's this area sometimes where the fans
[25:34.210 --> 25:35.710]  don't hit every single leaf.
[25:35.710 --> 25:39.350]  So you got to ride in there for 12 hours with the lights on you.
[25:39.350 --> 25:44.390]  Imagine how sticky and funky your hand is going to be after 12 hours of that shit.
[25:44.390 --> 25:49.150]  The top leaf is sweating from on the bottom because all that leaf pressed against it.
[25:49.150 --> 25:52.630]  The bottom leaf is sweating from the top because all that leaf against it and you're just creating
[25:52.630 --> 25:53.910]  funk inside of there.
[25:53.910 --> 25:56.710]  Powdery mildew will pop up from that.
[25:56.710 --> 26:00.950]  So if you pull off all these extra leaves, you eliminate the opportunity for that powdery
[26:00.950 --> 26:02.870]  mildew to develop under your leaves.
[26:02.870 --> 26:04.970]  So that's something that's really helpful, I think.
[26:04.970 --> 26:06.530]  Also there's less places for bugs.
[26:06.530 --> 26:10.290]  If you go in there and you pull off all the leaves, that's way less opportunity for bugs
[26:10.290 --> 26:11.290]  to hide.
[26:11.290 --> 26:15.130]  The bugs prefer those leaves with longer petioles that stick out a little bit further.
[26:15.130 --> 26:18.050]  They like to go right underneath those real big ass leaves and hang out.
[26:18.050 --> 26:21.450]  It's the first place you're going to see bug damages on the low, larger leaves, I think,
[26:21.450 --> 26:22.810]  most of the time.
[26:22.810 --> 26:24.370]  So eliminate that shit.
[26:24.370 --> 26:25.370]  Get rid of it.
[26:25.430 --> 26:27.550]  Give the bugs an opportunity to get there.
[26:27.550 --> 26:30.470]  Also clean up the bottoms of your plants, you guys.
[26:30.470 --> 26:34.070]  Nothing should touch the pot or the floor or the dirt.
[26:34.070 --> 26:36.910]  Like none of the stuff that's hanging off the bottom of your plant should really touch
[26:36.910 --> 26:37.910]  that.
[26:37.910 --> 26:38.910]  Clean that up.
[26:38.910 --> 26:40.550]  If you can get in there with some scissors at the early start of flower, just clean it
[26:40.550 --> 26:41.550]  up.
[26:41.550 --> 26:44.950]  You want, depending on the size of pot and size of plant you're using, I usually have
[26:44.950 --> 26:50.550]  at least six to eight inches between the pot and the first two stalks that come off my
[26:50.550 --> 26:51.550]  branch.
[26:51.550 --> 26:52.590]  I will clean that up.
[26:52.590 --> 26:56.450]  Sometimes if I'm going in a larger pot and growing larger plants, I'll clean a foot.
[26:56.450 --> 26:59.190]  Sometimes at Green and Healthy, when I had the large warehouse, we would over-veg for
[26:59.190 --> 27:02.450]  too long and then we would just trellis everything out.
[27:02.450 --> 27:05.970]  And then stuff that didn't reach, I would just chop off all the branches that didn't
[27:05.970 --> 27:10.370]  reach to the trellis and we'd have a foot and a half of just naked shaved legs.
[27:10.370 --> 27:13.530]  Sometimes two feet of just naked bear shaved legs.
[27:13.530 --> 27:15.330]  But that promotes better airflow.
[27:15.330 --> 27:19.050]  And again, it gives you less opportunity for bugs to get in there, less places for powdery
[27:19.050 --> 27:20.050]  mildew.
[27:20.050 --> 27:23.170]  And we're not trying to grow leaves, we're trying to go grow buds.
[27:23.170 --> 27:24.330]  So get in there about week three.
[27:24.330 --> 27:28.490]  Excuse me, get in there about week three, take off most of your fan leaves, if not all
[27:28.490 --> 27:29.490]  of them.
[27:29.490 --> 27:30.490]  I like to leave the two on the top of the bud.
[27:30.490 --> 27:32.090]  You know, you got that top cola.
[27:32.090 --> 27:35.450]  I like to leave two or four leaves up there and they can grab some light, create some
[27:35.450 --> 27:36.450]  energy.
[27:36.450 --> 27:37.450]  But that lower stuff, just go mad.
[27:37.450 --> 27:39.250]  I take most of that lower shit right off.
[27:39.250 --> 27:40.970]  I don't even think about it.
[27:40.970 --> 27:42.850]  Then I get in there about week five and do it again.
[27:42.850 --> 27:44.490]  I'll feed it a bloom booster.
[27:44.490 --> 27:47.890]  I will feed it a root pack and a foliar pack to make it explode.
[27:48.730 --> 27:50.290]  Excuse the throat clearing, you guys.
[27:50.290 --> 27:54.410]  Shout out to TR Concentrates with their Jack Flash Hash.
[27:54.410 --> 27:56.090]  Huge fat dabs made me a little choked up.
[27:56.090 --> 27:59.810]  But I like to get in there and take off the leaves, feed it a root pack, feed it a foliar
[27:59.810 --> 28:03.930]  pack, feed it a strong bloom booster about week five, week six, and then go in there
[28:03.930 --> 28:05.730]  and pull off the leaves.
[28:05.730 --> 28:07.290]  You'll really notice it bulk up.
[28:07.290 --> 28:08.290]  That's my opinion.
[28:08.290 --> 28:09.850]  Indica strains really like it.
[28:09.850 --> 28:12.770]  Flow, blueberry, that type of stuff really appreciates it.
[28:12.770 --> 28:16.930]  Some of the sativa dominant strains don't go super heavy, but still get in there and
[28:16.930 --> 28:17.930]  take off some leaves.
[28:17.930 --> 28:18.930]  All right.
[28:18.930 --> 28:20.930]  That's what I think about defoliation.
[28:20.930 --> 28:25.330]  Also, Jesse and I did an episode and we talked about cleaning up your outdoor garden.
[28:25.330 --> 28:27.730]  Clean up your indoor garden, you guys.
[28:27.730 --> 28:29.490]  Get a broom and sweep up.
[28:29.490 --> 28:31.130]  Just why not sweep up at the end of the day?
[28:31.130 --> 28:32.130]  You've got to be there.
[28:32.130 --> 28:35.050]  Spend an extra five or 10 minutes and sweep up that place.
[28:35.050 --> 28:37.930]  Pick up all the little litter that lands in the grow room.
[28:37.930 --> 28:40.950]  Maybe there's a zip tie that you use for something that you cut down.
[28:40.950 --> 28:41.950]  Clean that shit up.
[28:41.950 --> 28:43.370]  There's no need to leave extra stuff sitting around.
[28:43.370 --> 28:44.370]  Put all your tools away.
[28:44.370 --> 28:45.890]  Put all your equipment away.
[28:45.890 --> 28:46.890]  Clean out your sprayers.
[28:46.890 --> 28:47.970]  Clean out your pumps.
[28:47.970 --> 28:51.090]  Clean out anything that can be cleaned so that it's ready for you the next time you
[28:51.090 --> 28:52.090]  need to use it.
[28:52.090 --> 28:55.490]  Just take a couple minutes at the end of the day and clean shit up.
[28:55.490 --> 28:57.930]  If you're growing at home, you guys, have dedicated stuff.
[28:57.930 --> 28:59.050]  Have a dedicated broom.
[28:59.050 --> 29:02.250]  Have a dedicated dustpan for your grow rooms.
[29:02.250 --> 29:04.450]  Try to have a dedicated trash can.
[29:04.450 --> 29:08.290]  When you clean up, when you sweep up, if you've got dead leaves on the floor, if you find
[29:08.290 --> 29:12.090]  that you've got some dead bugs on the floor, sometimes you'll find randomly just there'll
[29:12.090 --> 29:14.690]  be a little pile of dead like whiteflies or fungus gnats or something.
[29:14.690 --> 29:17.650]  Maybe you sprayed and then a few days later all these bugs died and they just all landed
[29:17.650 --> 29:18.650]  over there by that fan.
[29:18.650 --> 29:22.890]  When you clean that stuff up, sweep it all up into a trash can and take that trash can
[29:22.890 --> 29:24.050]  out of the grow room.
[29:24.050 --> 29:25.610]  Don't leave it in the grow.
[29:25.610 --> 29:28.370]  If you've got dead leaves in there, don't leave those in the grow either.
[29:28.370 --> 29:30.290]  You don't want that stuff in there.
[29:30.290 --> 29:34.890]  Every dead leave and piece of stuff on the floor is another place for a bug to hide.
[29:34.890 --> 29:36.090]  I said this to somebody the other day.
[29:36.090 --> 29:39.570]  I said, if you've got five spider mites hiding underneath one leaf, two of them are going
[29:39.570 --> 29:40.570]  to hook up.
[29:40.570 --> 29:41.570]  Two of them are going to fuck.
[29:41.570 --> 29:43.770]  They're going to make a million spider mite babies.
[29:44.330 --> 29:47.530]  You do the math on that because it's just going to keep going.
[29:47.530 --> 29:48.530]  I'm right.
[29:48.530 --> 29:51.730]  If you've got five people at a party, by the end of the night, two people are hooking up.
[29:51.730 --> 29:53.650]  That's how these spider mites are going to be.
[29:53.650 --> 29:57.410]  If you leave one leaf and you've got five spider mites under there, in five days you're
[29:57.410 --> 30:00.930]  going to have that multiplied by whatever spider mites breed out, which is a ridiculous
[30:00.930 --> 30:01.930]  rate.
[30:01.930 --> 30:02.930]  Clean up that one leaf.
[30:02.930 --> 30:03.930]  Just pick it up.
[30:03.930 --> 30:04.930]  There's no need for all that shit around there.
[30:04.930 --> 30:07.170]  Get out the shop vac and clean up the corners.
[30:07.170 --> 30:08.770]  Dust the tops of the lights.
[30:08.770 --> 30:09.770]  Go in.
[30:09.770 --> 30:12.450]  You will be amazed at how many bugs are in the crevices in your Govita lights.
[30:12.450 --> 30:15.770]  If you've got a large commercial facility and you get up top and you clean out your
[30:15.770 --> 30:17.550]  lights, there's a bunch of bugs up there.
[30:17.550 --> 30:18.550]  Clean all that shit out.
[30:18.550 --> 30:19.550]  It's nasty.
[30:19.550 --> 30:20.550]  You don't want to have that in there.
[30:20.550 --> 30:21.850]  Also clean your fans while you're at it.
[30:21.850 --> 30:22.850]  All right.
[30:22.850 --> 30:23.970]  You guys have been rambling on for a long time.
[30:23.970 --> 30:27.530]  I feel like that's enough info, enough tips, and a bunch of email talking for one episode.
[30:27.530 --> 30:31.770]  I want to thank everybody for listening to an episode of just me rambling by myself.
[30:31.770 --> 30:36.330]  I'm still working on the episode I promised you about pest prevention, management, identification,
[30:36.330 --> 30:37.330]  and eradication.
[30:37.330 --> 30:40.970]  I'm writing how to take care of a whole bunch of bugs, a whole bunch of different situations.
[30:40.970 --> 30:42.410]  It's going to be a multi-show piece.
[30:42.410 --> 30:46.170]  I'm trying to write out at least two full episodes before I get it started.
[30:46.170 --> 30:47.170]  I like to get ahead of myself.
[30:47.170 --> 30:50.530]  Speaking of episodes, I've got written out and I'm getting ahead of myself with.
[30:50.530 --> 30:54.730]  I've got a debate about organics versus ... I don't know if it's a debate, but whatever.
[30:54.730 --> 30:56.850]  The pros and cons of organics versus synthetics.
[30:56.850 --> 30:59.050]  I've got a lot of other great stuff coming up for you.
[30:59.050 --> 31:01.210]  I hope you guys stay tuned to future episodes.
[31:01.210 --> 31:02.210]  Once again, thank you guys for listening.
[31:02.210 --> 31:05.050]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[31:05.050 --> 31:06.050]  That's right.
[31:06.050 --> 31:08.010]  Much love, much respect.
[31:08.010 --> 31:09.570]  The community working for the community.
[31:10.170 --> 31:12.170]  They're like the FUBU of the Ganja community.
[31:12.170 --> 31:13.530]  Yeah, I said that out loud.
[31:13.530 --> 31:14.530]  All right.
[31:14.530 --> 31:17.490]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you guys for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[31:17.490 --> 31:18.490]  podcast.
[31:18.490 --> 31:19.730]  I want to give a huge shout out to Maddie and Spence.
[31:19.730 --> 31:23.010]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
