[00:01.600 --> 00:22.710]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 90 of the Grow From
[00:22.710 --> 00:27.310]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:27.310 --> 00:31.150]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're an old school
[00:31.150 --> 00:35.490]  smoker, or if you're a Pendi Warren dad kid, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:35.490 --> 00:39.590]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[00:39.590 --> 00:44.030]  for you. I'm your host. They call me Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining me. As always,
[00:44.030 --> 00:47.350]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots band for letting me play
[00:47.350 --> 00:52.670]  their music on the show. Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew. I'm
[00:52.670 --> 00:57.030]  going to turn down that music a little bit. You guys, our friend Jesse came over and we
[00:57.030 --> 01:02.590]  recorded for almost two hours. We had to stop for a second and fix the headphone amplifier.
[01:02.590 --> 01:06.910]  It tried to crap out on us, but we got everything back on track. So let's do a quick ad and
[01:06.910 --> 01:10.830]  then we will get onto the show. You guys, this podcast is brought to you by my good
[01:10.830 --> 01:14.990]  friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations
[01:14.990 --> 01:20.350]  to serve Colorado. Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach Street, or check out the Pueblo
[01:20.350 --> 01:25.950]  location on 618 East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado. Check out Hygro for competitive
[01:25.950 --> 01:29.970]  pricing and a great selection of indoor growth supplies. You guys, our good friend Jesse
[01:29.970 --> 01:34.430]  works at Hygro. He's the manager there. His wife is probably who you'll bump into. Either
[01:34.430 --> 01:37.990]  Bernadette or LaDonna is most likely who you're going to see when you go in there. There are
[01:37.990 --> 01:43.070]  a couple other folks that work there, but it's most of the time it's Jesse, Bern, or
[01:43.070 --> 01:46.230]  LaDonna. So when you go in there, you're shopping with my friends. You guys, these are really
[01:46.230 --> 01:51.150]  cool people. They are members of the community. They are not just sales folks with a store.
[01:51.150 --> 01:55.030]  They're there to help you out. So make sure you support our friends at Hygro Indoor Growing
[01:55.030 --> 01:58.150]  Supplies. And when you are checking out at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies, make sure you
[01:58.150 --> 02:01.710]  let them know you listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast, and they will give you
[02:01.710 --> 02:05.910]  commercial pricing on your entire purchase. That'll save you a few bucks. We all know
[02:05.910 --> 02:10.470]  that money is expensive. All right, you guys, I've been rambling long enough. I'm going
[02:10.470 --> 02:15.030]  to let this music fade out, and we will be right back with our good friend Jesse.
[02:15.030 --> 02:20.950]  All right, guys, I am back, and sitting across the table from me is our good buddy Jesse.
[02:20.950 --> 02:22.270]  How you doing today, bro?
[02:22.270 --> 02:23.270]  Pretty good. Pretty good.
[02:23.270 --> 02:26.230]  Man, thanks for coming. I know you've been a busy man, so it's always good having you.
[02:26.230 --> 02:30.610]  It's grower season. It is farmer season. So you guys, I just threw on the microphones
[02:30.610 --> 02:33.350]  real quick. We were going to do a podcast, and then Jesse mentioned something, and I
[02:33.350 --> 02:38.150]  was like, I'm going to hit record. Jesse just said, if you were using general organics
[02:38.150 --> 02:44.150]  to not adjust the pH when you're done, I completely agree with that. Then what did you say to
[02:44.150 --> 02:46.790]  use to adjust the pH if you had to?
[02:46.790 --> 02:54.070]  Oh, nothing. I was saying it's built into the formula, the CA Mag Plus or Cal Mag Plus
[02:54.070 --> 03:00.430]  that it is, they have. It's a pH buffer. I'm not exactly sure on the entire science of
[03:00.430 --> 03:06.030]  it, but I do know for a fact that if you try to pH it, it will mess your shit up. You're
[03:06.030 --> 03:07.710]  going to have some funky looking plants.
[03:07.710 --> 03:12.190]  Right. Well, because if you're using organics, it's already organic. If you go and pour acids
[03:12.190 --> 03:15.670]  in there that we're using, I think it's a phosphoric acid, which is the pH down. I don't
[03:15.670 --> 03:16.670]  remember exactly what it is.
[03:16.670 --> 03:17.670]  Yes, I believe so. There's a couple different estimates.
[03:17.670 --> 03:21.670]  It's got the word acid in there. That tells you that it's going to go in there and start
[03:21.670 --> 03:25.470]  destroying all of your organics and your myco life. All right. Well, I just wanted to get
[03:25.470 --> 03:28.470]  that on recording, guys, since we were talking about it. Sometimes the best shit comes out
[03:28.510 --> 03:32.190]  before I turn on the microphones and I always feel like, damn, I wasted some time there.
[03:32.190 --> 03:34.790]  So I just wanted to put on the mics and get that on there. Jesse, welcome to the show,
[03:34.790 --> 03:37.790]  my friend. Thanks for coming. I really appreciate you having here, bro.
[03:37.790 --> 03:38.790]  Thanks for having me.
[03:38.790 --> 03:42.830]  All right, I'm all choked up from some dabs. Let's get official. I invited Jesse over to
[03:42.830 --> 03:49.830]  do a podcast, and my topic was our friend John Rossum on Periscope asked if he can grow
[03:49.830 --> 03:56.070]  his bag seeds. The short answer is, hell yes, you can grow your bag seeds. We've got a really
[03:56.190 --> 04:01.390]  long answer also. One thing I want to mention, though, a lot of the older cats that I try
[04:01.390 --> 04:07.710]  to pitch my seeds to are flabbergasted and blown away by the price of a 10-pack of seeds.
[04:07.710 --> 04:11.070]  Lately a 10-pack of seeds will go anywhere, it depends on the breeder, anywhere from 50
[04:11.070 --> 04:13.710]  to 100 bucks for a 10-pack of good regular or feminized.
[04:13.710 --> 04:15.710]  150 even. Yeah, I see that all the time.
[04:15.710 --> 04:18.710]  I've seen swamp boys are doing 180 now for a 10-pack of seeds.
[04:18.710 --> 04:19.710]  Like Rare Dankness.
[04:19.710 --> 04:23.710]  Okay. Yeah, some of these higher known companies are definitely able to get more money, 150
[04:24.350 --> 04:27.350]  to 200 bucks for a pack of seeds. Now a lot of people are going to say, what the hell?
[04:27.350 --> 04:31.350]  And then some of these old guys, they say, but dude, I've got a big baggie of seeds in
[04:31.350 --> 04:36.350]  my closet from when I used to smoke pot and sift it out on a record cover, on an album cover.
[04:38.350 --> 04:42.350]  Those seeds are great. I recommend you grow those, but do not try to sell those. The reason
[04:42.350 --> 04:47.350]  they aren't sellable, the reason that the seeds us breeders are selling and pushing
[04:47.350 --> 04:51.350]  and promoting, the reason they cost more money is because we know what the parents are, we
[04:51.990 --> 04:54.990]  know what's going to come from those seeds. We've done time selecting the male and female
[04:54.990 --> 05:00.990]  to produce a seed line that has probably gone several years in testing and development to
[05:00.990 --> 05:01.990]  figure out what we want.
[05:01.990 --> 05:03.990]  No herbs, high quality.
[05:03.990 --> 05:08.990]  Yeah, and consistency is something I really... No herbs, a lot of quality, good resin production,
[05:08.990 --> 05:12.990]  good flowering time. There are some plants when you get them, I've worked strains down
[05:12.990 --> 05:18.990]  from 90-day flowering times by breeding it into other things. We've cut it down by breeding
[05:19.630 --> 05:22.630]  it several times, we've brought it to 60 days and it's still pretty much the same plant.
[05:22.630 --> 05:28.630]  All we've done is breed it to shorter flowering plants. Put it to the flow, grow the seeds
[05:28.630 --> 05:33.630]  that come from that out, find the one that's a lot like the original male or female, whichever
[05:33.630 --> 05:37.630]  we were trying to do, and then put that back to flow. Because flow is a quick plant. We
[05:37.630 --> 05:40.630]  just bred things to flow and sped it up a little bit.
[05:40.630 --> 05:42.630]  It passes on traits really well too.
[05:42.630 --> 05:46.630]  Yes she does. So if you guys are looking to start a breeding project, get a Colorado Flow
[05:47.270 --> 05:49.270]  and play with her because that's a fun one to breed with.
[05:49.270 --> 05:52.270]  But what I'm getting at is those bag seeds that these older cats or maybe you younger
[05:52.270 --> 05:57.270]  cats have, the reason those aren't marketable and sellable is because you don't know the
[05:57.270 --> 06:02.270]  parents, you don't know the genetic heritage of them, so they are not a marketable seed.
[06:02.270 --> 06:06.270]  But you can definitely give them away, you can definitely grow the shit out of them.
[06:06.270 --> 06:08.270]  Grow your bag seed.
[06:08.270 --> 06:10.270]  You could have hermaphrodites, you guys.
[06:10.270 --> 06:12.270]  You could have a bunch of males.
[06:12.270 --> 06:14.270]  You could have shitty ass ragweed.
[06:14.910 --> 06:16.910]  But you could, you very well could have...
[06:16.910 --> 06:18.910]  Something... Sorry.
[06:18.910 --> 06:20.910]  No go for it.
[06:20.910 --> 06:22.910]  Jesse's getting excited over here.
[06:22.910 --> 06:24.910]  Kim Dog, I'm stoned I can barely fucking...
[06:24.910 --> 06:26.910]  You just blurted out exactly the strain.
[06:26.910 --> 06:28.910]  Kim Dog came from...
[06:28.910 --> 06:30.910]  Kim Dog was fucking bag seed.
[06:30.910 --> 06:32.910]  Kim Dog is known as one of the strongest strains on earth.
[06:32.910 --> 06:34.910]  It's been on the cover of High Times Magazine three or four times.
[06:34.910 --> 06:36.910]  It's the single strongest strain on earth.
[06:36.910 --> 06:40.910]  But also that was old bag seed when stain strains weren't...
[06:40.910 --> 06:42.910]  You know, this is a really deep discussion.
[06:43.550 --> 06:45.550]  Yes, we can get way into the Kim Dog story.
[06:45.550 --> 06:47.550]  There wasn't just a bunch of junk strains back then.
[06:47.550 --> 06:49.550]  I mean I'm sure there was, but you know...
[06:49.550 --> 06:51.550]  Chances are if somebody grew...
[06:51.550 --> 06:55.550]  If you bought that bag of weed and it had a seed in there, chances are it was decent weed.
[06:55.550 --> 06:57.550]  You know what I'm saying?
[06:57.550 --> 06:59.550]  The only thing is we don't know what it was.
[06:59.550 --> 07:03.550]  A lot of people back in the day don't even know what the girl plant they got or what the buds they got were.
[07:03.550 --> 07:05.550]  They want to say this is like Acapulco gold or something.
[07:05.550 --> 07:07.550]  But it was just whatever that dude said it was.
[07:07.550 --> 07:09.550]  It was before we really knew and cared a lot about genetics.
[07:09.550 --> 07:11.550]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:12.190 --> 07:16.190]  And then also, on things you could get, you could even get Mexican auto flowering.
[07:16.190 --> 07:18.190]  You never know.
[07:18.190 --> 07:20.190]  Yeah, it could.
[07:20.190 --> 07:22.190]  And some people want those Mexican auto flowering plants.
[07:22.190 --> 07:24.190]  Some people would love to have that.
[07:24.190 --> 07:26.190]  Some people...
[07:26.190 --> 07:28.190]  People message me all the time asking when I'm going to make auto flowers.
[07:28.190 --> 07:30.190]  This wasn't...
[07:30.190 --> 07:32.190]  That's my answer.
[07:32.190 --> 07:34.190]  This was never supposed to be about my brand or my company.
[07:34.190 --> 07:36.190]  But I read genetics will never make auto flowering plants.
[07:36.190 --> 07:38.190]  I don't believe in the use of auto flowering.
[07:38.190 --> 07:40.190]  I'm actually straying far away from Femini seeds.
[07:40.830 --> 07:42.830]  Because I like the males in the population.
[07:42.830 --> 07:44.830]  I think that we need male plants.
[07:44.830 --> 07:46.830]  And Femini seeds, they don't...
[07:46.830 --> 07:48.830]  I can't make enough Femini seeds to keep people happy.
[07:48.830 --> 07:50.830]  Yeah, that's hard to do.
[07:50.830 --> 07:52.830]  Yeah, they want so many of them damn things.
[07:52.830 --> 07:54.830]  So Jesse hit the nail right on the head when he said you could have the next Chemdog.
[07:54.830 --> 07:56.830]  Chemdog came from bag seed.
[07:56.830 --> 07:58.830]  Two dudes sold a guy a bag of weed on a Grateful Dead parking lot.
[07:58.830 --> 08:00.830]  In 95, I think it was.
[08:00.830 --> 08:02.830]  Chemdog found seeds in the parking lot.
[08:02.830 --> 08:04.830]  And they were like, oh, that's a good idea.
[08:04.830 --> 08:06.830]  And they were like, oh, that's a good idea.
[08:06.830 --> 08:08.830]  And they were like, oh, that's a good idea.
[08:09.470 --> 08:11.470]  And they were like, oh, that's a good idea.
[08:11.470 --> 08:13.470]  And they were like, oh, that's a good idea.
[08:13.470 --> 08:15.470]  And he found seeds in that weed and he grew that shit.
[08:15.470 --> 08:17.470]  And out of one of those seeds...
[08:17.470 --> 08:19.470]  And you guys, go Google the legend of Chemdog and the 13 beans.
[08:19.470 --> 08:21.470]  If you're listening to this podcast and you want to be deep into the cannabis culture
[08:21.470 --> 08:23.470]  and you want to know some heritage,
[08:23.470 --> 08:25.470]  Google Chemdog and the legend of the 13 beans.
[08:25.470 --> 08:27.470]  And also, I got to give a big shout out to the Adam Dunn Show, a podcast.
[08:27.470 --> 08:29.470]  They do an entire episode where Chemdog actually calls in
[08:29.470 --> 08:31.470]  and they discuss where this strain came from.
[08:31.470 --> 08:33.470]  And they discuss where this strain came from.
[08:33.470 --> 08:35.470]  And they discuss where this strain came from.
[08:35.470 --> 08:37.470]  A lot of the people that were in the chain of that podcast
[08:38.110 --> 08:40.110]  and everything,
[08:40.110 --> 08:42.110]  and these people were on the old school forums.
[08:42.110 --> 08:44.110]  If any of the listeners are forum junkies,
[08:44.110 --> 08:46.110]  they already know the story.
[08:46.110 --> 08:48.110]  I'm going to write this down.
[08:48.110 --> 08:50.110]  One day we're going to have to talk about OG
[08:50.110 --> 08:52.110]  and if OG means overgrow or not.
[08:52.110 --> 08:54.110]  I want to get a few older growers on here and see.
[08:54.110 --> 08:56.110]  When I just said OG, I meant overgrow.
[08:56.110 --> 08:58.110]  Yeah, you meant overgrow the website, overgrow.com.
[08:58.110 --> 09:00.110]  It was a website that we used to frequent
[09:00.110 --> 09:02.110]  and talk about growing cannabis.
[09:02.110 --> 09:04.110]  Subcool was on there.
[09:04.110 --> 09:06.110]  All the cool breeders were on there.
[09:06.750 --> 09:08.750]  Everyone.
[09:08.750 --> 09:10.750]  There's a theory that the OG Kush came from overgrow.
[09:10.750 --> 09:12.750]  There's a theory that the OG Kush came from overgrow.
[09:12.750 --> 09:14.750]  But also people think it's the original Gangster.
[09:14.750 --> 09:16.750]  I've also heard it ocean grown.
[09:16.750 --> 09:18.750]  We'll talk about that on this show in the future.
[09:18.750 --> 09:20.750]  We need a few more OGs on the show to come talk with us on that one.
[09:20.750 --> 09:22.750]  We need a few more OGs on the show to come talk with us on that one.
[09:22.750 --> 09:24.750]  So grow out those bag seeds because you could have Chemdog, you guys.
[09:24.750 --> 09:26.750]  You could also have junk.
[09:26.750 --> 09:28.750]  You could totally have junk.
[09:28.750 --> 09:30.750]  There's a little pet peeve.
[09:30.750 --> 09:32.750]  Don't sell clones of junk.
[09:32.750 --> 09:34.750]  If you live in Colorado, don't sell clones of junk.
[09:35.390 --> 09:37.390]  If you live in Colorado, don't do that.
[09:37.390 --> 09:39.390]  And don't sell your junky seeds from your junky clones.
[09:39.390 --> 09:41.390]  And don't sell your junky seeds from your junky clones.
[09:41.390 --> 09:43.390]  It's really rude.
[09:43.390 --> 09:45.390]  It is rude.
[09:45.390 --> 09:47.390]  It's disrespectful to your customers.
[09:47.390 --> 09:49.390]  It's disrespectful to your patients.
[09:49.390 --> 09:51.390]  It's disrespectful to the plant itself.
[09:51.390 --> 09:53.390]  It's disrespectful to the future of cannabis.
[09:53.390 --> 09:55.390]  If you grow a plant and you take clones of it,
[09:55.390 --> 09:57.390]  don't give those clones out until you have flowered the damn plant
[09:57.390 --> 09:59.390]  and you've verified that it's something worthwhile.
[09:59.390 --> 10:01.390]  and you've verified that it's something worthwhile.
[10:01.390 --> 10:03.390]  There are so many strains available.
[10:04.030 --> 10:06.030]  Grow something worthwhile.
[10:06.030 --> 10:08.030]  If it's not, as a breeder, it is so hard to breed something
[10:08.030 --> 10:10.030]  If it's not, as a breeder, it is so hard to breed something
[10:10.030 --> 10:12.030]  and then grow a hundred seeds and realize that you have just created fucking hemp.
[10:12.030 --> 10:14.030]  and then grow a hundred seeds and realize that you have just created fucking hemp.
[10:14.030 --> 10:16.030]  The strain doesn't do us any good.
[10:16.030 --> 10:18.030]  I've got 6,000 seeds of it
[10:18.030 --> 10:20.030]  and all I'm going to do is feed them to some birds
[10:20.030 --> 10:22.030]  because I don't want anybody growing this.
[10:22.030 --> 10:24.030]  I've got one cross that it was a lemon cush idea
[10:24.030 --> 10:26.030]  and dude, it grew the fattest, chunkiest, tallest nuggets.
[10:26.030 --> 10:28.030]  and dude, it grew the fattest, chunkiest, tallest nuggets.
[10:28.030 --> 10:30.030]  They were bigger than my arms.
[10:30.030 --> 10:32.030]  They didn't have any flavor or any resin.
[10:32.670 --> 10:34.670]  It just grew the biggest hemp ever.
[10:34.670 --> 10:36.670]  It was terrible.
[10:36.670 --> 10:38.670]  I know. I have horrible herming problems
[10:38.670 --> 10:40.670]  and all mine drives me nuts.
[10:40.670 --> 10:42.670]  And your breeding projects?
[10:42.670 --> 10:44.670]  Yeah. Because so much of it is involved with chem dog.
[10:44.670 --> 10:46.670]  Yeah. Because so much of it is involved with chem dog.
[10:46.670 --> 10:48.670]  Yeah, chem does have a tendency to herm in there.
[10:48.670 --> 10:50.670]  So you guys have to find, if you're going to breed with chem dog,
[10:50.670 --> 10:52.670]  make sure you back cross or out cross that hermitry
[10:52.670 --> 10:54.670]  make sure you back cross or out cross that hermitry
[10:54.670 --> 10:56.670]  Go find a solid progeny, two solid progeny from your F1s
[10:56.670 --> 10:58.670]  Go find a solid progeny, two solid progeny from your F1s
[10:58.670 --> 11:00.670]  and work those. I'm just going ahead of myself here.
[11:01.310 --> 11:03.310]  Alright, so sometimes it's hard to guess what pollinated
[11:03.310 --> 11:05.310]  the seeded buds that you've got.
[11:05.310 --> 11:07.310]  But you know that that female
[11:07.310 --> 11:09.310]  makes quality medicine.
[11:09.310 --> 11:11.310]  So maybe the donor was a male in the room.
[11:11.310 --> 11:13.310]  Maybe something hermed.
[11:13.310 --> 11:15.310]  It's probably just a stress seed.
[11:15.310 --> 11:17.310]  It's usually a light leak or something like that
[11:17.310 --> 11:19.310]  is what's causing these bag seeds.
[11:19.310 --> 11:21.310]  A lot of over-neuting. Irregular watering.
[11:21.310 --> 11:23.310]  Yeah, surprises.
[11:23.310 --> 11:25.310]  Surprises on the plants, definitely.
[11:25.310 --> 11:27.310]  If you get them too hot and let them get too dry, they'll start throwing out seeds.
[11:27.310 --> 11:29.310]  A seed is the plant's response
[11:29.950 --> 11:31.950]  of, oh shit.
[11:31.950 --> 11:33.950]  The plant goes, you know what, I think I'm going to die here soon.
[11:33.950 --> 11:35.950]  And it's only
[11:35.950 --> 11:37.950]  it's like a horny person.
[11:37.950 --> 11:39.950]  It just wants to reproduce.
[11:39.950 --> 11:41.950]  That's the plant's whole mission.
[11:41.950 --> 11:43.950]  Just to reproduce. The resin is there
[11:43.950 --> 11:45.950]  to protect the plant so that it can reproduce.
[11:45.950 --> 11:47.950]  The pistils, which everybody calls hairs,
[11:47.950 --> 11:49.950]  those are there to collect pollen
[11:49.950 --> 11:51.950]  so that it can reproduce.
[11:51.950 --> 11:53.950]  Everything is all about these plants reproducing.
[11:53.950 --> 11:55.950]  So if you piss off a plant,
[11:55.950 --> 11:57.950]  it will try to make a seed as a reaction.
[11:59.950 --> 12:01.950]  It just wants to make sure that it continues.
[12:01.950 --> 12:03.950]  It doesn't want to be wiped out.
[12:03.950 --> 12:05.950]  That's its main job in life.
[12:05.950 --> 12:07.950]  That is its job.
[12:07.950 --> 12:09.950]  That's its purpose, to reproduce and continue.
[12:09.950 --> 12:11.950]  We're tricking it in many ways.
[12:11.950 --> 12:13.950]  So be respectful to it.
[12:13.950 --> 12:15.950]  I think I had a list of which strains were
[12:15.950 --> 12:17.950]  Gorilla Glue number 4
[12:17.950 --> 12:19.950]  and 7.
[12:19.950 --> 12:21.950]  All of the Gorilla Glue strains were actually
[12:21.950 --> 12:23.950]  bag seed.
[12:23.950 --> 12:25.950]  Accidental pollinations that created seeds
[12:25.950 --> 12:27.950]  that Josie Wales, shout out to Josie Wales,
[12:28.590 --> 12:30.590]  or good accident, happy accident.
[12:30.590 --> 12:32.590]  We're glad that happened.
[12:32.590 --> 12:34.590]  Thanks for popping those beans.
[12:34.590 --> 12:36.590]  Golden Goat, one of Colorado's
[12:36.590 --> 12:38.590]  most popular strains ever.
[12:38.590 --> 12:40.590]  One of my most popular strains
[12:40.590 --> 12:42.590]  for my growing, my photography.
[12:42.590 --> 12:44.590]  A lot of people give me credit for breeding Golden Goat.
[12:44.590 --> 12:46.590]  I'm going to say right now, I did not
[12:46.590 --> 12:48.590]  breed the Golden Goat. Golden Goat was bred
[12:48.590 --> 12:50.590]  by a guy known as Mr. Dank in Topeka, Kansas.
[12:50.590 --> 12:52.590]  It was an accident
[12:52.590 --> 12:54.590]  that was not meant
[12:54.590 --> 12:56.590]  to happen.
[12:57.230 --> 12:59.230]  I think we're back.
[12:59.230 --> 13:01.230]  I think we recorded all the first part too.
[13:01.230 --> 13:03.230]  I'm pretty sure.
[13:03.230 --> 13:05.230]  We're using the Zoom H6 handy recorder today.
[13:05.230 --> 13:07.230]  I'm pretty sure I recorded that first part.
[13:07.230 --> 13:09.230]  We had to take a quick break.
[13:09.230 --> 13:11.230]  This Live Wire Solutions
[13:11.230 --> 13:13.230]  HA04 4-channel stereo headphone amplifier,
[13:13.230 --> 13:15.230]  it's going to get a hammer put to it pretty soon here
[13:15.230 --> 13:17.230]  because it just pisses me off.
[13:17.230 --> 13:19.230]  I think we were on Golden Goat.
[13:19.230 --> 13:21.230]  I was saying that I did not breed
[13:21.230 --> 13:23.230]  Golden Goat.
[13:23.230 --> 13:25.230]  I did not breed Golden Goat.
[13:25.870 --> 13:27.870]  I was saying that I did not breed the Golden Goat.
[13:27.870 --> 13:29.870]  Mr. Dank bred that.
[13:29.870 --> 13:31.870]  Topeka, Kansas of all places.
[13:31.870 --> 13:33.870]  I did however get a clone of it.
[13:33.870 --> 13:35.870]  When I first started breeding,
[13:35.870 --> 13:37.870]  I thought I had Topeka, Kansas of all damn places.
[13:37.870 --> 13:39.870]  I almost skipped right over that.
[13:39.870 --> 13:41.870]  That's probably the coolest town in Kansas.
[13:41.870 --> 13:43.870]  I'm going to vote for Lawrence.
[13:43.870 --> 13:45.870]  I'm going to vote for Lawrence, Kansas.
[13:45.870 --> 13:47.870]  I have done things in Lawrence, Kansas
[13:47.870 --> 13:49.870]  that I can't even talk about on this podcast.
[13:49.870 --> 13:51.870]  My boss got T-boned
[13:51.870 --> 13:53.870]  in that there's an army base outside of there.
[13:54.510 --> 13:56.510]  He got T-boned there.
[13:56.510 --> 13:58.510]  We ended up spending a day and a half
[13:58.510 --> 14:00.510]  in Lawrence, Kansas.
[14:00.510 --> 14:02.510]  It's not the Kansas I'm used to.
[14:02.510 --> 14:04.510]  That's the truth.
[14:04.510 --> 14:06.510]  There's a club every 30 seconds.
[14:06.510 --> 14:08.510]  It's like the boulder.
[14:08.510 --> 14:10.510]  It's the liberal stronghold of that state.
[14:10.510 --> 14:12.510]  Topeka is pretty close too.
[14:12.510 --> 14:14.510]  We went to Topeka.
[14:14.510 --> 14:16.510]  We went to Wichita.
[14:16.510 --> 14:18.510]  I lived in Lawrence for a little while
[14:18.510 --> 14:20.510]  so I had a good time there.
[14:20.510 --> 14:22.510]  I got a hold of a clone of it.
[14:23.150 --> 14:25.150]  My good friend Josh, a long time ago,
[14:25.150 --> 14:27.150]  gave me a clone of that.
[14:27.150 --> 14:29.150]  The Hawaiian guy.
[14:29.150 --> 14:31.150]  I call him Pineapple Express.
[14:31.150 --> 14:33.150]  I haven't hung out with that dude in a long time.
[14:33.150 --> 14:35.150]  Pineapple Express brought me a clone
[14:35.150 --> 14:37.150]  of the Golden Goat.
[14:37.150 --> 14:39.150]  When I first started breeding,
[14:39.150 --> 14:41.150]  one of my ideas was I felt bad
[14:41.150 --> 14:43.150]  that in Colorado we had all of the elite genetics
[14:43.150 --> 14:45.150]  and everybody in Idaho.
[14:45.150 --> 14:47.150]  I never felt that.
[14:47.150 --> 14:49.150]  I'm a compassionate guy.
[14:49.150 --> 14:51.150]  They were like, how do I get these clones?
[14:51.790 --> 14:53.790]  I can't get you clones of these elite cuts
[14:53.790 --> 14:55.790]  but I will make seeds of them.
[14:55.790 --> 14:57.790]  My idea was to make seeds of the Golden Goat
[14:57.790 --> 14:59.790]  just by reversing it.
[14:59.790 --> 15:01.790]  I did put seeds of the Golden Goat out.
[15:01.790 --> 15:03.790]  I'm the one that made the S1 feminized Golden Goat seeds.
[15:03.790 --> 15:05.790]  As far as I know, I'm the only one
[15:05.790 --> 15:07.790]  that has done that.
[15:07.790 --> 15:09.790]  I put about 5,000 of those seeds out.
[15:09.790 --> 15:11.790]  You're one of the only people that bred with it.
[15:11.790 --> 15:13.790]  You and I think Scott's done something with it.
[15:13.790 --> 15:15.790]  I've seen Gage make one strain with Golden Goat.
[15:16.430 --> 15:18.430]  Yeah.
[15:18.430 --> 15:20.430]  And then...
[15:20.430 --> 15:22.430]  Ali...
[15:22.430 --> 15:24.430]  What's his seed company name?
[15:24.430 --> 15:26.430]  Ali G...
[15:26.430 --> 15:28.430]  No, fuck.
[15:28.430 --> 15:30.430]  There's a dude out of San Francisco.
[15:30.430 --> 15:32.430]  Yeah, Ali G.
[15:32.430 --> 15:34.430]  Algae, that's what it is.
[15:34.430 --> 15:36.430]  I'm going to have to Google this guy.
[15:36.430 --> 15:38.430]  It's spelled kind of phonetically.
[15:38.430 --> 15:40.430]  He's bred a couple strains with Golden Goat.
[15:40.430 --> 15:42.430]  Cool. It's a great plant.
[15:42.430 --> 15:44.430]  But it was...
[15:45.070 --> 15:47.070]  It was from a bag seed.
[15:47.070 --> 15:49.070]  It was an accident.
[15:49.070 --> 15:51.070]  Colorado takes pretty much
[15:51.070 --> 15:53.070]  all the credit for that.
[15:53.070 --> 15:55.070]  That is definitely a local strain.
[15:55.070 --> 15:57.070]  That's partly my fault.
[15:57.070 --> 15:59.070]  And it's a pain in the ass to keep a...
[15:59.070 --> 16:01.070]  It's a pain in the ass to keep a mother of that.
[16:01.070 --> 16:03.070]  You have to take clones from that Golden Goat often.
[16:03.070 --> 16:05.070]  If you've got one, hold on to it.
[16:05.070 --> 16:07.070]  I guarantee you in a few more years
[16:07.070 --> 16:09.070]  that'll be...
[16:09.070 --> 16:11.070]  A lot of strains are getting harder to find.
[16:11.070 --> 16:13.070]  That's true.
[16:13.710 --> 16:15.710]  The old school blueberry.
[16:15.710 --> 16:17.710]  Show me a good chem four.
[16:17.710 --> 16:19.710]  Give me a P91 clone.
[16:19.710 --> 16:21.710]  Romulan.
[16:21.710 --> 16:23.710]  Everyone used to grow Romulan.
[16:23.710 --> 16:25.710]  I've heard a couple of people.
[16:25.710 --> 16:27.710]  I'm going to give you a shout out right quick.
[16:27.710 --> 16:29.710]  Jesse is actually the moderator.
[16:29.710 --> 16:31.710]  He's the one that started the...
[16:31.710 --> 16:33.710]  What's the name of the Facebook group?
[16:33.710 --> 16:35.710]  Colorado Dope Cannabis Growers.
[16:35.710 --> 16:37.710]  You guys join Jesse's Facebook group
[16:37.710 --> 16:39.710]  if you're serious.
[16:39.710 --> 16:41.710]  I will troll you a little bit.
[16:42.350 --> 16:44.350]  I hope you're not an internet vagina
[16:44.350 --> 16:46.350]  because I'm a troll and I'm going to get you.
[16:46.350 --> 16:48.350]  It's a fun group. Come join us.
[16:48.350 --> 16:50.350]  They help you learn about cannabis
[16:50.350 --> 16:52.350]  in a fun, positive way.
[16:52.350 --> 16:54.350]  We will clear up all the rumors and myths.
[16:54.350 --> 16:56.350]  If you have a question, come join the group
[16:56.350 --> 16:58.350]  if you're a cannabis grower, if you're curious about cannabis.
[16:58.350 --> 17:00.350]  We love teaching you.
[17:00.350 --> 17:02.350]  We love sharing and it's another avenue to do that
[17:02.350 --> 17:04.350]  and it's free.
[17:04.350 --> 17:06.350]  If you're a total noob,
[17:06.350 --> 17:08.350]  not to be a dick,
[17:08.350 --> 17:10.350]  but there are better groups
[17:10.990 --> 17:12.990]  to find this.
[17:12.990 --> 17:14.990]  This group is comprised of growers only.
[17:18.990 --> 17:20.990]  Don't be shy, you guys.
[17:20.990 --> 17:22.990]  Hit me up on Facebook or Jesse directly
[17:22.990 --> 17:24.990]  and we will answer your questions.
[17:24.990 --> 17:26.990]  Jesse may take a little bit longer.
[17:26.990 --> 17:28.990]  He doesn't carry the iPhone like I do.
[17:28.990 --> 17:30.990]  He's not attached to it like I am.
[17:30.990 --> 17:32.990]  I've usually got the phone in my pocket.
[17:32.990 --> 17:34.990]  When I'm working at the spot, I've got the phone turned off
[17:34.990 --> 17:36.990]  because there's no service back there anyway.
[17:36.990 --> 17:38.990]  Yeah, service is rough on you in grow rooms.
[17:39.630 --> 17:41.630]  Our facility is like a fucking bomb shelter.
[17:41.630 --> 17:43.630]  I could live back there for six months.
[17:43.630 --> 17:45.630]  Try to turn a radio on in the middle of it
[17:45.630 --> 17:47.630]  when all the lights are on.
[17:47.630 --> 17:49.630]  Although you got the Kavita's, I don't know if that still does that.
[17:49.630 --> 17:51.630]  We're way off topic here, but in Denver,
[17:51.630 --> 17:53.630]  this is something that I recently heard
[17:53.630 --> 17:55.630]  and or read about and had a conversation
[17:55.630 --> 17:57.630]  with multiple people about.
[17:57.630 --> 17:59.630]  In Denver, they're driving around.
[17:59.630 --> 18:01.630]  If you're running old school magnetic ballasts,
[18:01.630 --> 18:03.630]  I'm not sure if the new digitals will do it,
[18:03.630 --> 18:05.630]  but the old school magnetics,
[18:05.630 --> 18:07.630]  if you're running enough of those,
[18:08.270 --> 18:10.270]  it will cut off an AM frequency.
[18:10.270 --> 18:12.270]  If you take an AM radio in that room,
[18:12.270 --> 18:14.270]  you have it tuned into the station, it's working,
[18:14.270 --> 18:16.270]  you can hear it.
[18:16.270 --> 18:18.270]  If you walk near those ballasts,
[18:18.270 --> 18:20.270]  it will cut out and make a weird humming noise.
[18:20.270 --> 18:22.270]  It's at a specific frequency, too.
[18:22.270 --> 18:24.270]  I've tried it on a couple places I know of.
[18:24.270 --> 18:26.270]  It makes a hum
[18:26.270 --> 18:28.270]  and some dashes and beeps.
[18:28.270 --> 18:30.270]  It definitely puts off a unique signal.
[18:30.270 --> 18:32.270]  Okay.
[18:32.270 --> 18:34.270]  The Denver police
[18:34.270 --> 18:36.270]  are using a radio
[18:36.910 --> 18:38.910]  They're using an ultra-sensitive radio pickup.
[18:38.910 --> 18:40.910]  Probably a strong antenna
[18:40.910 --> 18:42.910]  is what I guess they're using.
[18:42.910 --> 18:44.910]  They're driving around neighborhoods
[18:44.910 --> 18:46.910]  and when they get that,
[18:46.910 --> 18:48.910]  they're driving back by with infrared cameras.
[18:48.910 --> 18:50.910]  Now they're checking your lights.
[18:50.910 --> 18:52.910]  Yeah.
[18:52.910 --> 18:54.910]  Amsterdam all over.
[18:54.910 --> 18:56.910]  Once they've done that, they're going back home
[18:56.910 --> 18:58.910]  or back to the station and checking to see
[18:58.910 --> 19:00.910]  if you're a medical marijuana caregiver
[19:00.910 --> 19:02.910]  so that you've got permission to have all these lights
[19:02.910 --> 19:04.910]  or, since in the state of Colorado,
[19:05.550 --> 19:07.550]  you're only supposed to have six plants,
[19:07.550 --> 19:09.550]  if you've got all that light,
[19:09.550 --> 19:11.550]  you're supposed to be registered as a grower.
[19:11.550 --> 19:13.550]  If you're not, they go and knock on your door
[19:13.550 --> 19:15.550]  and ask what's going on.
[19:15.550 --> 19:17.550]  So in Denver, be careful
[19:17.550 --> 19:19.550]  if you've got those magnetic ballasts.
[19:19.550 --> 19:21.550]  For the cops or for the guys using magnetic ballasts?
[19:21.550 --> 19:23.550]  Well, yeah.
[19:23.550 --> 19:25.550]  Come buy some nanos from me or our Denver store
[19:25.550 --> 19:27.550]  on Beach Street.
[19:27.550 --> 19:29.550]  Ask for
[19:29.550 --> 19:31.550]  Brandon or Cassandra.
[19:31.550 --> 19:33.550]  Cassandra, that's the chick you'll see.
[19:34.190 --> 19:36.190]  She's cool as fuck.
[19:36.190 --> 19:38.190]  Is that the Denver store?
[19:38.190 --> 19:40.190]  Yeah.
[19:40.190 --> 19:42.190]  I've never been to the Denver store,
[19:42.190 --> 19:44.190]  so I may have to drop in there and just go wander around
[19:44.190 --> 19:46.190]  and not even tell them who I am
[19:46.190 --> 19:48.190]  and just walk around and look at the store.
[19:48.190 --> 19:50.190]  I like to do that when they don't know who I am.
[19:50.190 --> 19:52.190]  Alright, so we're getting high and getting off-topic here,
[19:52.190 --> 19:54.190]  but we've had a few dabs, so that's okay.
[19:54.190 --> 19:56.190]  What else was I going to say?
[19:56.190 --> 19:58.190]  I'm going to be controversial here.
[19:58.190 --> 20:00.190]  I cannot prove this, but it is my theory
[20:00.190 --> 20:02.190]  that the Girl Scout cookies is probably a fuck-up
[20:02.830 --> 20:04.830]  and I've never really agreed with it.
[20:04.830 --> 20:06.830]  There's a reason I haven't released any of my stuff yet.
[20:06.830 --> 20:08.830]  I have very high standards
[20:08.830 --> 20:10.830]  and I haven't been able to achieve them yet.
[20:12.830 --> 20:14.830]  But Girl Scout cookies, in my opinion,
[20:14.830 --> 20:16.830]  is a herm.
[20:16.830 --> 20:18.830]  It does not breed stable.
[20:18.830 --> 20:20.830]  I've crossed it to the Grateful Dog.
[20:20.830 --> 20:22.830]  It is a really neat breeder.
[20:22.830 --> 20:24.830]  It is a really neat plant to breed with.
[20:24.830 --> 20:26.830]  Fuck yeah, but it produces hermaphrodites.
[20:28.830 --> 20:30.830]  I put it to the Grateful Dog
[20:31.470 --> 20:33.470]  I'll show you a little bit after we record here.
[20:33.470 --> 20:35.470]  I've seen some pictures.
[20:35.470 --> 20:37.470]  I know a couple other people that have grown that.
[20:37.470 --> 20:39.470]  That one's...
[20:39.470 --> 20:41.470]  Maybe not Grateful Dog.
[20:41.470 --> 20:43.470]  I'm thinking of the other one.
[20:43.470 --> 20:45.470]  Oh, the King Kim to the Girl Scout cookies?
[20:45.470 --> 20:47.470]  Yes.
[20:47.470 --> 20:49.470]  Even that was...
[20:49.470 --> 20:51.470]  After breeding with it
[20:51.470 --> 20:53.470]  and growing and seeing a couple different hybrids
[20:53.470 --> 20:55.470]  of it, you can recognize it real quick.
[20:55.470 --> 20:57.470]  For sure.
[20:57.470 --> 20:59.470]  Alright, so while we're talking
[21:00.110 --> 21:02.110]  about bag seeds,
[21:02.110 --> 21:04.110]  if you're going to go bag seeds,
[21:04.110 --> 21:06.110]  I already said that, right?
[21:06.110 --> 21:08.110]  You've got to be careful for hermaphrodites.
[21:08.110 --> 21:10.110]  When you're growing these bag seeds,
[21:10.110 --> 21:12.110]  treat it just like a normal seed during veg.
[21:12.110 --> 21:14.110]  You're not going to know what the parents are,
[21:14.110 --> 21:16.110]  so you're going to have to pay a lot of attention to it during flower.
[21:16.110 --> 21:18.110]  When you start flowering,
[21:18.110 --> 21:20.110]  you have to look every single day
[21:20.110 --> 21:22.110]  for hermaphrodite flowers on these plants.
[21:22.110 --> 21:24.110]  Oh yeah.
[21:24.110 --> 21:26.110]  Sometimes twice a day.
[21:26.110 --> 21:28.110]  Yeah, and look out for males, too.
[21:28.750 --> 21:30.750]  I've had plants surprise me.
[21:30.750 --> 21:32.750]  I thought they were full-on female until about day 20.
[21:32.750 --> 21:34.750]  Then it popped open a nut sack somewhere
[21:34.750 --> 21:36.750]  and I'm like, oh, that's got to go.
[21:36.750 --> 21:38.750]  So look for male flowers,
[21:38.750 --> 21:40.750]  herm flowers all over the entire plant
[21:40.750 --> 21:42.750]  once or twice a day
[21:42.750 --> 21:44.750]  through the entire bloom cycle,
[21:44.750 --> 21:46.750]  you guys, of a bag seed.
[21:46.750 --> 21:48.750]  It had a seed for a reason
[21:48.750 --> 21:50.750]  and it could herm out
[21:50.750 --> 21:52.750]  in the end of week 8.
[21:52.750 --> 21:54.750]  So if it does, you either need to be able
[21:54.750 --> 21:56.750]  to harvest it before it produces a seed
[21:57.390 --> 21:59.390]  or you need to get in there and be able to tweeze out.
[21:59.390 --> 22:01.390]  If it makes one or two male flowers,
[22:01.390 --> 22:03.390]  sometimes you can pull them out with tweezers.
[22:03.390 --> 22:05.390]  Hit the plant, spray the plant with a water bottle,
[22:05.390 --> 22:07.390]  just mist it a little bit
[22:07.390 --> 22:09.390]  because mist deactivates pollen.
[22:09.390 --> 22:11.390]  Moisture will ruin pollen, so give it a nice mist,
[22:11.390 --> 22:13.390]  get in there with some tweezers and pull out those male flowers,
[22:13.390 --> 22:15.390]  put them in a trash bag, throw them away.
[22:15.390 --> 22:17.390]  I got in an argument with someone
[22:17.390 --> 22:19.390]  in Facebook clan the other day.
[22:19.390 --> 22:21.390]  I posted a picture
[22:21.390 --> 22:23.390]  of a friend's hemp plant,
[22:23.390 --> 22:25.390]  a male, and
[22:26.030 --> 22:28.030]  he told me that that growth spot was ruined for life
[22:28.030 --> 22:30.030]  and that pollen doesn't die
[22:30.030 --> 22:32.030]  and it travels for hundreds of miles
[22:32.030 --> 22:34.030]  and all that.
[22:36.030 --> 22:38.030]  Got anything to say about that, Jeff?
[22:38.030 --> 22:40.030]  I just want to go to
[22:40.030 --> 22:42.030]  that forum or that post and just troll that guy
[22:42.030 --> 22:44.030]  is what I want to do.
[22:44.030 --> 22:46.030]  You can get rid of pollen quite easily.
[22:46.030 --> 22:48.030]  Sweep the floor, get in there with some water.
[22:48.030 --> 22:50.030]  Water deactivates pollen, you guys.
[22:50.030 --> 22:52.030]  It's very, very fragile.
[22:52.030 --> 22:54.030]  It's hard to store, in fact.
[22:54.670 --> 22:56.670]  You have to keep it.
[22:56.670 --> 22:58.670]  I keep my pollen, I have little vials of pollen
[22:58.670 --> 23:00.670]  that are sealed and they are
[23:00.670 --> 23:02.670]  inside of another jar that is sealed
[23:02.670 --> 23:04.670]  and that is inside of a refrigerator
[23:04.670 --> 23:06.670]  that stays dark.
[23:06.670 --> 23:08.670]  That's how careful I am with my pollen.
[23:08.670 --> 23:10.670]  Big shout out to Canaventure. What up, Rusty?
[23:10.670 --> 23:12.670]  Rusty threw a bunch of pollen on me.
[23:12.670 --> 23:14.670]  The last time he was here, he dropped off like four or five
[23:14.670 --> 23:16.670]  little bags of pollen, so there may be some
[23:16.670 --> 23:18.670]  Canaventure irie crosses coming up in the near future.
[23:18.670 --> 23:20.670]  That's where all my Yeti stuff came from
[23:20.670 --> 23:22.670]  was a
[23:23.310 --> 23:25.310]  friendly pollen delivery from someone.
[23:25.310 --> 23:27.310]  Man, shout out to that Yeti OG
[23:27.310 --> 23:29.310]  that you made live resin with
[23:29.310 --> 23:31.310]  last summer.
[23:31.310 --> 23:33.310]  That stuff was memorable,
[23:33.310 --> 23:35.310]  remarkable, legendary. That was some good shit.
[23:35.310 --> 23:37.310]  I wish that was back around.
[23:37.310 --> 23:39.310]  Big shout out to Spence. He's the one that made that.
[23:39.310 --> 23:41.310]  There was just a little bit of that.
[23:41.310 --> 23:43.310]  I got some of that.
[23:43.310 --> 23:45.310]  Luckily, I get to be in the group.
[23:45.310 --> 23:47.310]  That was in the spring.
[23:47.310 --> 23:49.310]  You had some good runs back then, too.
[23:49.310 --> 23:51.310]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:51.950 --> 23:53.950]  It seems like everybody got busy and carried away
[23:53.950 --> 23:55.950]  and all the hash artists got too busy
[23:55.950 --> 23:57.950]  and we're just all disconnected.
[23:57.950 --> 23:59.950]  We need to all reconnect again.
[23:59.950 --> 24:01.950]  Everybody on the podcast.
[24:01.950 --> 24:03.950]  We need everybody on the podcast again.
[24:03.950 --> 24:05.950]  Everybody, you gotta come back.
[24:05.950 --> 24:07.950]  We're gonna get a party going.
[24:07.950 --> 24:09.950]  Episode 100 is coming up, dude.
[24:09.950 --> 24:11.950]  This is gonna be number 90, I think, right here.
[24:11.950 --> 24:13.950]  I didn't do an intro for it,
[24:13.950 --> 24:15.950]  but I think this is number 90.
[24:15.950 --> 24:17.950]  Number 100 is coming up, you guys.
[24:17.950 --> 24:19.950]  If you have any cool ideas, if you want to be on episode number 100,
[24:20.590 --> 24:22.590]  hit me up. It's hyregenetics at hotmail.com.
[24:22.590 --> 24:24.590]  I'd love to have you on the show.
[24:24.590 --> 24:26.590]  We're talking about bag seeds.
[24:26.590 --> 24:28.590]  What else do you have to add about bag seed, bro?
[24:28.590 --> 24:30.590]  Where were we? Where are Girl Scout cookies?
[24:30.590 --> 24:32.590]  I was assuming, alleging that Girl Scout cookies
[24:32.590 --> 24:34.590]  was probably an accident
[24:34.590 --> 24:36.590]  and came from bag seed.
[24:36.590 --> 24:38.590]  Part of my theory on that is because I've heard
[24:38.590 --> 24:40.590]  so many different rumors and legends
[24:40.590 --> 24:42.590]  of how it was made and who made it.
[24:42.590 --> 24:44.590]  I've never...
[24:44.590 --> 24:46.590]  The people that are alleged to have made it
[24:46.590 --> 24:48.590]  have never said what it is.
[24:49.230 --> 24:51.230]  It's an F1 Derby, is what I hear a lot.
[24:51.230 --> 24:53.230]  I'll call them out. They've said, straight up,
[24:53.230 --> 24:55.230]  they've said two or three different stories.
[24:55.230 --> 24:57.230]  I wouldn't even believe anything they said at this point.
[24:57.230 --> 24:59.230]  I've read at least three different stories
[24:59.230 --> 25:01.230]  in high times, and they all say they came
[25:01.230 --> 25:03.230]  from the same people.
[25:03.230 --> 25:05.230]  And they all say no one has it, and that's a bunch of bullshit.
[25:05.230 --> 25:07.230]  It's everywhere. If you don't have Girl Scout cookies yet by now,
[25:07.230 --> 25:09.230]  let us know, because everybody in our crew
[25:09.230 --> 25:11.230]  has a... I've got the Platinum, I've got the Forum,
[25:11.230 --> 25:13.230]  I've got Cookies and Cream by now,
[25:13.230 --> 25:15.230]  I've got Cookie Wreck.
[25:15.230 --> 25:17.230]  There's Cookies Times Everything.
[25:17.870 --> 25:19.870]  I'm done with it and letting it go.
[25:19.870 --> 25:21.870]  That's pretty much all that Matt Ian Smiths wants to smoke, is cookies.
[25:21.870 --> 25:23.870]  It's still one of my favorite smokes.
[25:23.870 --> 25:25.870]  I've got some in the cloner now, so let me know if you want another one back.
[25:25.870 --> 25:27.870]  Oh yeah, no.
[25:27.870 --> 25:29.870]  I spread that around good.
[25:31.870 --> 25:33.870]  If you really want something, go to the forums.
[25:33.870 --> 25:35.870]  That's the truth.
[25:35.870 --> 25:37.870]  I've got two or three good sources
[25:37.870 --> 25:39.870]  for clones around here, and one of them,
[25:39.870 --> 25:41.870]  he gets everything from the forums.
[25:41.870 --> 25:43.870]  He's kind of a quiet guy. He does not look like a pot grower.
[25:43.870 --> 25:45.870]  He looks like he probably would work on computers
[25:46.510 --> 25:48.510]  or study law somewhere.
[25:48.510 --> 25:50.510]  He shows up with a briefcase and opens it up
[25:50.510 --> 25:52.510]  and drops me off a few cuttings of some elite shit
[25:52.510 --> 25:54.510]  that he got online.
[25:54.510 --> 25:56.510]  I love when clones come from him.
[25:56.510 --> 25:58.510]  Also, it seems like right around the same time he gets them,
[25:58.510 --> 26:00.510]  either you or Spence will end up with the same cuttings.
[26:00.510 --> 26:02.510]  You guys will throw me a cut, or I'll trade you a cut,
[26:02.510 --> 26:04.510]  just because that's how our group works.
[26:04.510 --> 26:06.510]  I'll run them side by side,
[26:06.510 --> 26:08.510]  and I'm always so amazed that everybody
[26:08.510 --> 26:10.510]  got the same cut.
[26:10.510 --> 26:12.510]  How did Spence end up with this Girl Scout Cookies
[26:12.510 --> 26:14.510]  and my other friend ended up with the Girl Scout Cookies
[26:15.150 --> 26:17.150]  and I ran them, and they're the same fucking thing.
[26:17.150 --> 26:19.150]  They started from the same seed somewhere.
[26:19.150 --> 26:21.150]  It's so amazing to me.
[26:21.150 --> 26:23.150]  We've all grown enough of it.
[26:23.150 --> 26:25.150]  You can tell instantly,
[26:25.150 --> 26:27.150]  if it's it,
[26:27.150 --> 26:29.150]  how do all these people on the internet
[26:29.150 --> 26:31.150]  have the same freaking thing?
[26:31.150 --> 26:33.150]  Yeah. It's crazy.
[26:33.150 --> 26:35.150]  They're getting around.
[26:35.150 --> 26:37.150]  People are flying, they're driving,
[26:37.150 --> 26:39.150]  they're taking a horse. I don't know what they're doing.
[26:39.150 --> 26:41.150]  If you get some weed,
[26:41.150 --> 26:43.150]  if you get some good quality cannabis,
[26:43.790 --> 26:45.790]  and you don't have money to spend on some high quality seeds
[26:45.790 --> 26:47.790]  that we know all the history behind them,
[26:47.790 --> 26:49.790]  and they were bred by magic elves
[26:49.790 --> 26:51.790]  in a dungeon in Quebec.
[26:51.790 --> 26:53.790]  I'm just being a smartass here.
[26:53.790 --> 26:55.790]  If you don't want to pay good money for seeds,
[26:55.790 --> 26:57.790]  if you don't have access to good clones,
[26:57.790 --> 26:59.790]  just throw some of those bag seeds in a paper towel,
[26:59.790 --> 27:01.790]  germinate them, start them out,
[27:01.790 --> 27:03.790]  just like you would any other seeds,
[27:03.790 --> 27:05.790]  and pay a lot of attention,
[27:05.790 --> 27:07.790]  and then grow them out, smoke it with your friends.
[27:07.790 --> 27:09.790]  Here's something I really have to say.
[27:09.790 --> 27:11.790]  Take a fucking clone.
[27:12.430 --> 27:14.430]  Oh my god, you guys, you wouldn't believe
[27:14.430 --> 27:16.430]  how many people say, look what I grew from seed,
[27:16.430 --> 27:18.430]  and I'm like, can I get a clone of that?
[27:18.430 --> 27:20.430]  And they're like, oh, I didn't take any clones.
[27:20.430 --> 27:22.430]  Dude, take a clone. It's not that hard.
[27:22.430 --> 27:24.430]  You take a little clone, you dip it in some shit,
[27:24.430 --> 27:26.430]  and you put it in a rooter. Get some clones.
[27:26.430 --> 27:28.430]  If it herms really bad, don't take a clone.
[27:28.430 --> 27:30.430]  That's true. Yeah, if it herms, throw away those clones.
[27:30.430 --> 27:32.430]  If it grows balls, throw away all the clones.
[27:32.430 --> 27:34.430]  Grow more seeds. Bag seeds are free.
[27:34.430 --> 27:36.430]  You already paid 50 bucks for that eighth
[27:36.430 --> 27:38.430]  or whatever you paid for it.
[27:38.430 --> 27:40.430]  Make sure you grow the seeds that are in there.
[27:41.070 --> 27:43.070]  You could grow the next Chemdog.
[27:43.070 --> 27:45.070]  You could grow the next Girl Scout cookies.
[27:45.070 --> 27:47.070]  You could grow the next Gorilla Glue.
[27:47.070 --> 27:49.070]  You could grow the next Golden Goat.
[27:49.070 --> 27:51.070]  You could have the next OG Kush.
[27:51.070 --> 27:53.070]  You could be...
[27:53.070 --> 27:55.070]  SFV, Tahoe, um...
[27:55.070 --> 27:57.070]  Shit, what else? What's another one?
[27:57.070 --> 27:59.070]  Crippy.
[27:59.070 --> 28:01.070]  East Coast Sour Diesel.
[28:01.070 --> 28:03.070]  Every single strain we were smoking
[28:03.070 --> 28:05.070]  came from seed.
[28:05.070 --> 28:07.070]  Every one of them.
[28:07.070 --> 28:09.070]  I can't think of one strain that didn't come from seed.
[28:09.710 --> 28:11.710]  If you can, I'll give you $100.
[28:13.710 --> 28:15.710]  Because every fucking cannabis plant we were smoking
[28:15.710 --> 28:17.710]  came from a seed somewhere.
[28:17.710 --> 28:19.710]  If you grow out that bag seed,
[28:19.710 --> 28:21.710]  you could have a cup winner right there.
[28:21.710 --> 28:23.710]  Because a lot of times,
[28:23.710 --> 28:25.710]  if you don't even know what it was bred with,
[28:25.710 --> 28:27.710]  that's yours. You don't have to give anybody credit.
[28:27.710 --> 28:29.710]  That's your seed. You found that.
[28:29.710 --> 28:31.710]  So you've got the Jesse's pride and joy now.
[28:31.710 --> 28:33.710]  So when the Cannabis Cup winnings come up,
[28:33.710 --> 28:35.710]  they go, and the winner for the most heady indica
[28:35.710 --> 28:37.710]  here in Denver, Colorado
[28:38.350 --> 28:40.350]  goes to Jesse for Jesse's Mystery Funk.
[28:40.350 --> 28:42.350]  And there you go, man.
[28:42.350 --> 28:44.350]  You just won that Cannabis Cup with a bag seed
[28:44.350 --> 28:46.350]  that you found.
[28:46.350 --> 28:48.350]  Chemdog did it. Why couldn't you?
[28:48.350 --> 28:50.350]  Yeah. True story.
[28:50.350 --> 28:52.350]  Alright, I've been rambling a lot.
[28:52.350 --> 28:54.350]  I need a dab.
[28:54.350 --> 28:56.350]  I think we're... I think it might be...
[28:56.350 --> 28:58.350]  We've been going for close to 30 minutes here.
[28:58.350 --> 29:00.350]  We could probably start wrapping up this part, dude.
[29:00.350 --> 29:02.350]  Alright, guys. We tried to wrap up this episode,
[29:02.350 --> 29:04.350]  but the conversation kept going.
[29:04.350 --> 29:06.350]  So what I decided to do was to make this a two-part episode.
[29:06.990 --> 29:08.990]  So I will drop episode number 91 Thursday morning,
[29:08.990 --> 29:10.990]  and that will be part two
[29:10.990 --> 29:12.990]  of Jesse and I hanging out.
[29:12.990 --> 29:14.990]  So I want to thank you guys for listening to this episode.
