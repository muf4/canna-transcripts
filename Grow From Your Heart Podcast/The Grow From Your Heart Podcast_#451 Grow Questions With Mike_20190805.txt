[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  What's up, podcast world? It is time for episode 451 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Sitting
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.240]  across the table from me is my buddy, White Mike. Thank you for joining me, dude.
[00:09.240 --> 00:11.240]  Yeah, man. What's up, everybody?
[00:11.240 --> 00:14.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, as always, this episode is brought to you by our friends at Seeds
[00:14.880 --> 00:19.640]  Here Now. If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds for your garden, I highly
[00:19.640 --> 00:28.880]  recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com. It has become
[00:28.880 --> 00:32.840]  a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what we're smoking on. Mike
[00:32.840 --> 00:38.600]  and I just took some ridiculous dabs of some pre-98 Bubba Kush batter. This stuff tastes
[00:38.600 --> 00:45.520]  delicious. I'm looking at the label. It says it has 61% THC and 72.2% total cannabinoids.
[00:45.520 --> 00:49.560]  It kind of sets you back in the chair. It makes you nice and mellow, doesn't it?
[00:49.560 --> 00:52.800]  Yeah, it's been a pretty chill evening since we broke that one out.
[00:52.800 --> 00:57.200]  Super chill pre-98 Bubba Kush. As soon as I let Mike smell it, he said, ooh, that smells
[00:57.200 --> 01:02.280]  delicious. So we took a couple dabs. I really like the earthy, gassy, funky sort of a smell
[01:02.280 --> 01:03.280]  that comes out of this one.
[01:03.280 --> 01:05.120]  It's just a solid Bubba.
[01:05.120 --> 01:07.920]  And then that batter is just so pretty. It's got that golden color.
[01:07.920 --> 01:08.920]  Beautiful batter.
[01:08.920 --> 01:12.840]  Nice kind of a cheesecake-y texture to it. Really liking that. So big shout out to our
[01:12.840 --> 01:18.480]  friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious pre-98 Bubba Kush batter. They've been killing
[01:18.480 --> 01:19.480]  it over there.
[01:19.480 --> 01:20.480]  Just another home run.
[01:20.480 --> 01:24.220]  Another home run. Knocked it out of the freaking park. All right. Mike and I are going to read
[01:24.220 --> 01:28.320]  some customer reviews in this episode. Before we get there, I would like to give a shout
[01:28.320 --> 01:31.420]  out to some of our friends from Patreon.
[01:31.420 --> 01:35.420]  How about a big shout out to my buddy Brett G. I want to send a big Giant Grow From Your
[01:35.420 --> 01:40.300]  Heart podcast shout out to my buddy Jacob W. How about a big shout out to Keith K. As
[01:40.300 --> 01:44.360]  always a giant shout out to Tommy. I want to give a Giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:44.360 --> 01:49.660]  shout out to my buddy Stabby McStabwood. And of course, a giant fist bump to my buddy Matthew
[01:49.660 --> 01:50.660]  KW.
[01:51.660 --> 01:55.140]  I want to send a big thank you to everybody who supports the show on Patreon. If you would
[01:55.140 --> 02:02.140]  like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[02:02.140 --> 02:06.900]  All of the information that you need will be right there on the screen. I think that's
[02:06.900 --> 02:10.500]  all the technical business we've got to take care of here at the start of the show. How
[02:10.500 --> 02:11.500]  you been, Mike?
[02:11.500 --> 02:12.500]  Been good, man. Yourself?
[02:12.500 --> 02:17.060]  Dude, I am great. Things are going very well. iReed Genetics has taken off. The podcast
[02:17.060 --> 02:21.740]  is getting a lot of listens. Life is going well, so I have nothing to complain about.
[02:21.740 --> 02:22.740]  I'm grateful and thankful.
[02:22.740 --> 02:23.740]  Loving it.
[02:23.740 --> 02:28.780]  I got to be a guest on the Dude Grows podcast with Scotty Real. That was a good time.
[02:28.780 --> 02:29.780]  What's up, Scotty?
[02:29.780 --> 02:33.460]  What's up, Scotty Real? We got a lot of great response to that. My YouTube boosted up. I
[02:33.460 --> 02:38.420]  got a lot of podcast listens. I actually reposted the episode on this feed, so maybe hopefully
[02:38.420 --> 02:40.940]  many of our friends listen to that episode.
[02:40.940 --> 02:43.140]  It's fun watching the community sort of blur together.
[02:43.140 --> 02:48.220]  I like mixing the Dude Grows crew and the iReed Army. I like blending them into one
[02:48.220 --> 02:53.540]  big cannabis force. I said on Scotty's show that I don't feel any sort of competition.
[02:53.540 --> 02:57.220]  There's no reason for one of us to feel... People say, Jeff, you've got the best show.
[02:57.220 --> 03:01.220]  I say, thank you. That means a lot to me. I'm proud to have the best, but I feel no
[03:01.220 --> 03:05.660]  sort of competition. I wasn't out to be better than anybody. I'm out to do my duty. But I
[03:05.660 --> 03:11.540]  love uniting the cannabis community. Scotty's team, my team, the Dude's team, my team, everybody.
[03:11.540 --> 03:16.380]  Shango Lowe's team from Shaping Fire. We're all on the same team. We all want legalized
[03:16.380 --> 03:21.420]  cannabis. We all want to grow the dank. So I feel no competition. I really love uniting
[03:21.420 --> 03:22.860]  everybody. It means a lot to me.
[03:22.860 --> 03:28.260]  I'm loving that sort of feel of the cannabis community right now. For a long time, it was
[03:28.260 --> 03:32.860]  like this is me and either you're one of my supporters or you're one of my haters. And
[03:32.860 --> 03:38.180]  if you support that guy, you're just a hater for me. Some of that's fallen away. Some of
[03:38.180 --> 03:39.180]  it.
[03:40.140 --> 03:45.540]  Now that we've got so many more States coming on, I have noticed that that's a thing in
[03:45.540 --> 03:50.140]  the new States. You've got to go in and flex and be like, no, we're bad motherfuckers.
[03:50.140 --> 03:55.100]  And then a lot of those people either survive or disappear. We've gone through enough of
[03:55.100 --> 03:59.340]  those phases here in Colorado to where we know the people who are doing it, who have
[03:59.340 --> 04:03.460]  survived it. We look at each other and we go, bro, you made the struggle. You're still
[04:03.460 --> 04:04.460]  here.
[04:04.460 --> 04:05.460]  You're still here.
[04:05.460 --> 04:07.580]  And we high five each other and we just keep going because we're like, oh, it's been so
[04:07.580 --> 04:08.580]  rough, man.
[04:08.580 --> 04:11.900]  And then the, the, the other that you see from time to time where it's you're still
[04:11.900 --> 04:12.900]  here.
[04:12.900 --> 04:17.740]  Unfortunately, there is some of that, but a lot of that weeds itself out. It does absolutely
[04:17.740 --> 04:18.740]  remove itself.
[04:18.740 --> 04:20.820]  The market cleans itself.
[04:20.820 --> 04:23.500]  I think most in industries do that.
[04:23.500 --> 04:27.540]  Yep. After, after a while, sometimes it takes a while for the, the course correction to
[04:27.540 --> 04:28.700]  happen, but it usually comes.
[04:28.700 --> 04:32.220]  I come from the music industry. I don't talk about that a lot on the show because this
[04:32.220 --> 04:35.820]  is grow from your heart, not drum from your heart. But I was in the music industry and
[04:35.820 --> 04:40.220]  it's the same shit in the music industry, the same nepotism, the same favoritism, the
[04:40.220 --> 04:42.100]  same bickering, the same infighting.
[04:42.100 --> 04:45.780]  It's the same thing, just different topics. It just shifts a little bit. It's the same
[04:45.780 --> 04:48.700]  reality show. It's the same soap opera.
[04:48.700 --> 04:53.540]  It's I watched it with so many artists that I love when the first couple albums that had
[04:53.540 --> 04:58.260]  a feel to it where like you could feel the emotion behind the music. And as soon as they
[04:58.260 --> 05:03.980]  got paid, like it's hard to feel like super angry when you're super rich.
[05:03.980 --> 05:09.660]  And so like album three, like they were still trying to sound like one and two, but it didn't
[05:09.660 --> 05:14.500]  ring true anymore because like, it's just hard to be that bad when like you got up and
[05:14.500 --> 05:19.700]  your Butler had your favorite breakfast ready for you. And like, I know you had a rough
[05:19.700 --> 05:23.420]  morning because your favorite Bentley wasn't like it was in the shop. So you had to take
[05:23.420 --> 05:26.940]  your second favorite Bentley to the show tonight to the Starbucks.
[05:26.940 --> 05:32.420]  Yep. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. I know exactly what you mean. A lot of my some of my favorite
[05:32.420 --> 05:36.300]  artists from back in the day, I can't even listen to the new stuff, but we say that if
[05:36.300 --> 05:41.020]  any band gets popular, people like, I can't listen to the new shit. They got successful.
[05:41.020 --> 05:45.300]  Sometimes it's a real thing. Sometimes like it's hard to, a lot of them are on drugs and
[05:45.300 --> 05:49.420]  they quit doing the good drugs and they get rich and they live in a mansion now and there's
[05:49.420 --> 05:54.580]  no, yeah, it's way different. You're totally correct. I'm going to get myself back on track
[05:54.580 --> 05:58.820]  here. I always shout out to the entire dude grows crew in the Irie army for accepting
[05:58.820 --> 06:02.620]  the collaboration of the community. That is cool. Once again, thanks to Scotty real,
[06:02.620 --> 06:06.180]  the dude and all of the entire dude grows crew. I think there are seven of them that
[06:06.180 --> 06:09.820]  all put it all together. Thanks to warehouse Kyle for staying at work late the day that
[06:09.820 --> 06:15.960]  I came to record. I do appreciate the crew, the team, everybody involved. One big community
[06:15.960 --> 06:22.340]  stay Irie. Mike's got a blank look on his face when I said stay Irie. They do a daily
[06:22.340 --> 06:27.460]  show it like four of them. I don't know how the fuck, I don't know how. And when you get
[06:27.460 --> 06:32.820]  there, you'll see how they do it. They are a, for a bunch of stoners. And I mean that
[06:32.820 --> 06:37.900]  like we're, we smoke when we get there, dude, I've been in the car for four hours. By the
[06:37.900 --> 06:42.900]  time I get to Scotty real's house, it's Hey dude, how are you? Let's take a dab. That,
[06:42.900 --> 06:46.060]  that noise was me dabbing. It's Hey, what's up? Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab. I don't really
[06:46.060 --> 06:51.780]  wait to say hi. I've been in the car for four hours. I 25, uh, is it's a fucking adventure.
[06:51.780 --> 06:56.980]  Right? Oh my God. She's broken in so many areas and it's far away. It's the main highway
[06:57.300 --> 07:02.980]  that runs North, South and Colorado. So to get from us to Scotty, it's four hours on this bitch
[07:02.980 --> 07:08.500]  four hours on that highway will make you want to, uh, not be on that highway. That is probably the
[07:08.500 --> 07:12.340]  best way to say it. So once you get there, you're ready for a dab. We get stoned. We,
[07:12.340 --> 07:16.580]  of course we get stoned. I get the whole room stoned when I show up. Then they say,
[07:16.580 --> 07:19.380]  how do we want to set up? What kind of show are we going to do? And you've seen the show,
[07:19.380 --> 07:24.100]  they've got a couple of options. They go and they put that shit together immediately.
[07:24.100 --> 07:26.820]  I thought I would have a couple of minutes, you know, chill out, drink a Dr. Pepper,
[07:26.820 --> 07:31.300]  get some water, maybe go take a piss, smoke a dab. It's fucking you ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Good
[07:31.300 --> 07:35.380]  because watch brah. And then it's all set up and you're like, damn, these guys are on fire.
[07:35.380 --> 07:38.820]  That's how they do multiple shows in a day because are in a week because they'll knock
[07:38.820 --> 07:43.380]  two, three shows out in two or three hours and just have it ready to go. They're awesome like
[07:43.380 --> 07:47.300]  that. Yeah. Killer production over there. Good job. You guys, they've added more cameras. Uh,
[07:47.300 --> 07:52.740]  they do a video show. Uh, that's a lot of extra work. The editing of the PC,
[07:53.140 --> 07:58.820]  YouTube. Yeah. Yeah. I can't do the video show by myself. I am not comfortable on camera alone
[07:58.820 --> 08:03.460]  and I don't have enough cameras and it's just not, yeah. The solo grow lessons would be a little,
[08:04.020 --> 08:10.100]  a little dull to watch. I feel like watching Chris D'Elia's podcast. Yeah. All right. Um,
[08:10.100 --> 08:14.100]  anything you want to touch on before we start reading these iTunes customer reviews?
[08:14.900 --> 08:20.500]  Nope. Nothing special. All right. Well then we are going to make a very unsmooth segue
[08:20.580 --> 08:26.500]  into reading some iTunes customer reviews. That's right. Uh, if you are using the iTunes
[08:26.500 --> 08:30.340]  application on your Apple device, if you've got an iPhone, if you've got an iPad and you're
[08:30.340 --> 08:35.380]  listening to the show through there, that is very, uh, I'm going to skip Mike's Android comments.
[08:35.380 --> 08:40.820]  It probably works very similarly on an Android device, but that is not what I use. Uh, iTunes
[08:40.820 --> 08:43.780]  is where I'm going. This is where these comments are coming from. If you'd like to leave a comment
[08:43.780 --> 08:48.420]  on the show, uh, go to your Apple device, go to the podcast, simply go to the Grow From Your
[08:48.420 --> 08:52.340]  Heart podcast. You're probably already close to that tab. Open the podcast, open Grow From Your
[08:52.340 --> 08:56.340]  Heart, go to available episodes and scroll right past there. When you scroll past there, you will
[08:56.340 --> 09:01.300]  be given the opportunity to leave a rating. It will let you leave an amount of stars. Most people,
[09:01.300 --> 09:06.900]  let's see how many, 246 people have given us a five-star rating. We've got one four-star,
[09:06.900 --> 09:12.020]  one three-star, one two-star and one one-star, which is fair mathematically. That makes me happy.
[09:12.020 --> 09:16.980]  I'm cool with all that. Uh, leave the amount of stars that you feel appropriate. If you think I'm
[09:16.980 --> 09:22.100]  not a good podcaster, let me know. I won't do much effort. Yeah. One guy, I'm not going to change
[09:22.100 --> 09:27.860]  much, but say what you have to say. I'm going to keep doing this. Um, but leave some stars also
[09:27.860 --> 09:32.660]  leave a review. Let me know what you think of the show and I will read your review on a future
[09:32.660 --> 09:39.780]  episode. And when I do that, it sounds a lot like this. I'm trying to find the most recent episode,
[09:39.780 --> 09:43.300]  the most recent comment, but I've scrolled away from it because I was trying to find more stuff.
[09:44.020 --> 09:47.460]  It's got to be right here. It can't be too far away. There it is. I found it. Thanks for listening
[09:47.460 --> 09:53.780]  to me ramble you guys. So this review comes from a person who calls themselves 401 smokes.
[09:53.780 --> 09:59.700]  They left this on June 6th of 2019. What up smokes? They left a five-star rating,
[09:59.700 --> 10:04.660]  but the headline of their review says don't make sense. I think he meant doesn't make sense.
[10:04.660 --> 10:10.900]  The comment says I got a $100 dehumidifier and I have no problems. It runs 24 seven, but
[10:10.900 --> 10:15.860]  if humidity is fine, it shuts down automatically. So I think he's replying to something
[10:15.860 --> 10:20.420]  I said when talking about purchasing or selecting equipment, uh, that sounds like he's replying
[10:20.420 --> 10:26.660]  replying or referring to a dehumidifier comment. Um, I'm glad your $100 dehumidifier works for you
[10:26.660 --> 10:31.380]  in your situation. That may not be the solution for everybody. Some people may need a $70
[10:31.380 --> 10:36.580]  dehumidifier. Some people may need a $500 dehumidifier. Depends on where you're at.
[10:37.540 --> 10:41.060]  You got to deal with how big is your room? How many plants, what are you doing? But I'm glad your
[10:41.060 --> 10:44.740]  equipment works for you. That's that's my point here. Right. Price point's not the only thing
[10:45.300 --> 10:49.380]  in a purchase, but it matters to a lot of people, but usually you get what you pay for.
[10:50.020 --> 10:55.300]  I talk a lot about when it comes to drying and curing, I talk about having the dehumidifier and
[10:55.300 --> 10:59.700]  the humidifier running constantly to battle each other. I think that creates a really nice
[10:59.700 --> 11:04.420]  environment. The only way to keep it where you want it. You can dial it in within 5%. If you want,
[11:04.420 --> 11:09.060]  if you're doing it any other way, you've got a limit on one side of the other that you can't
[11:09.060 --> 11:13.060]  control. Either the shit can get way too low on you and there's nothing you can do about it being
[11:13.060 --> 11:19.860]  too dry or shit gets too wet on you and you can't dry it out. So it does make sense. But hey, thank
[11:19.860 --> 11:24.420]  you for the five star rating. Thank you for the comment. I do appreciate that. And please keep
[11:24.420 --> 11:28.820]  listening to the podcast. Um, yeah, leave us another review in the future and let us know
[11:28.820 --> 11:33.460]  what you think. All right, we're going to move on to the next review. It says the dankness and they
[11:33.460 --> 11:40.580]  gave us a five star rating. This one was left by a person with a very clever name. They are called
[11:40.580 --> 11:47.460]  sofa king dank. They are so fucking dank. This review was left on June 11th of 2019.
[11:48.020 --> 11:53.700]  The review goes a lot like this. I am loving this podcast. I wish there was more though,
[11:53.700 --> 11:58.340]  but Rasta Jeff is growing the dank and growing the community. We're working on it right now,
[11:58.340 --> 12:02.820]  man. Yeah, we're doing more right now. I do two episodes a week. Most of the time I aim for a 30
[12:02.820 --> 12:10.100]  minute episode. Sometimes they've been like 25, 24 minutes lately. I feel like I would rather put
[12:10.100 --> 12:14.340]  out the information I'm trying to put out and press stop and be happy. I could put fluff on
[12:14.340 --> 12:18.900]  there. I could add some frosting, but there's no point. It already, it's a good show. You learn
[12:18.900 --> 12:24.180]  what you need to learn. That's what Mike's, Mike's the frosting. That's so gross right now. Um, but
[12:24.180 --> 12:28.820]  that's, I, I don't need to tell jokes at the end or tell a bedtime story. I put out a grow lesson.
[12:28.820 --> 12:32.100]  You learned what you needed. The point was proven, especially when it's a grow lesson,
[12:32.100 --> 12:36.580]  just get to the point, stay on topic and end when you're done with the info. There's like,
[12:36.580 --> 12:42.020]  if I'm listening for how to pop seeds, like when you're done with that segment, feel free to end it.
[12:42.020 --> 12:46.820]  There's no reason to go on to step whatever else after. I don't need to tell you a joke or anything,
[12:46.820 --> 12:51.300]  but, uh, so sometimes they are short and I feel like short and sweet is sometimes the way to go.
[12:51.860 --> 12:57.220]  And other times invite me over and we'll do an hour and a half show where we take the show out
[12:57.780 --> 13:02.660]  that that is quite often a thing, but we enjoy those shows. Yeah. People love all aspects of
[13:02.660 --> 13:06.980]  the show. We get, we do. They like it when we ramble, we're going to save that for the end.
[13:06.980 --> 13:13.060]  Don't shout that person out yet. Um, it's going to sound creepy coming through the recording.
[13:13.060 --> 13:16.420]  Cause it sounds really weird in my headphones. You're coming through compression. It makes it
[13:16.420 --> 13:22.260]  fuck. It sounds all right in my ears. All right. Um, so, so fucking dank. You're so fucking cool
[13:22.260 --> 13:26.180]  for leaving us a cool review. I appreciate that. They say they're loving the podcast.
[13:26.180 --> 13:31.140]  Uh, that's a great way to start a review. Uh, you wish there was more. Um, I'm going to put
[13:31.140 --> 13:35.380]  out more. It, it, it's a lot. It doesn't sound like it's a lot of work. It's a lot of 40 episodes
[13:35.380 --> 13:39.140]  in the can, man. Yeah. Go listen, go start at number one and catch up and then tell me that
[13:39.140 --> 13:43.060]  there's not enough. Uh, then, but they do acknowledge that I'm growing the dank. Uh,
[13:43.060 --> 13:46.500]  I am busy. I'm growing the dank. I'm breeding the seeds. I'm teaching people how to do it.
[13:47.940 --> 13:52.020]  Hands in a lot of pots, lots of joints and a lot of ashtrays. That's my version of irons in the
[13:52.020 --> 13:56.980]  fire. Um, lots of nails on the torch. And then he says, and growing the community. So I'm glad
[13:56.980 --> 14:01.460]  you acknowledge that I'm doing my best to grow and unite the community. We're talking about the DGC
[14:01.460 --> 14:06.500]  crew. We're talking about my crew. Uh, I'm glad that people see that. So thank you. That part
[14:06.500 --> 14:11.380]  does mean a lot to me, Mike, we've only got two more reviews. So we're working our way right
[14:11.380 --> 14:15.380]  through this. I shouldn't say only because that makes it sound like I don't appreciate the reviews
[14:15.380 --> 14:20.740]  that we do have. We appreciate you. We have two more exciting reviews, which we get to read on
[14:20.740 --> 14:24.100]  the show. That's how I should feel. I'll be really disappointed if they're not excited. Now,
[14:24.660 --> 14:27.940]  I promise you, they're excited. You better jump a shark or something. This one says
[14:27.940 --> 14:32.500]  Rasta. Jeff is the best. Aren't you already excited? I'm a little excited. We got five
[14:32.500 --> 14:39.300]  stars. That's exciting. The hardest part is going to be saying their name. Uh, C B I P S K
[14:39.300 --> 14:49.300]  A B I P. So BIPS, skip it. Skip it. That's just mean. I don't know. Maybe I'm saying some sort
[14:49.300 --> 14:52.740]  of a curse or something for picking it. Not you for saying, yeah, yeah. Maybe I just summoned
[14:52.740 --> 14:56.020]  some weird demon trying to say that though. So I'm going to not say that any more time to think
[14:56.020 --> 15:02.100]  three times we'll get beetle juice popping out, but a scoop BIPS good BIP. Thank you for the five
[15:02.100 --> 15:07.940]  stars. Let's read this review. The review is easier than the name. It says, this is by far
[15:07.940 --> 15:11.940]  my favorite podcast. Uh, that means a lot to me. I mentioned that earlier.
[15:11.940 --> 15:15.860]  Uh, and people have just started calling me RJ. I'm not Rasta Jeff anymore. Uh,
[15:15.860 --> 15:20.180]  people call me RJ when they type it. It's got to shrink the names down, but people address me as
[15:20.180 --> 15:24.340]  RJ, uh, and live chats now, like when they're saying it, they don't just type it. They say,
[15:24.340 --> 15:28.980]  Hey RJ. And even at the dude grow show, when people were coming to the booth,
[15:30.260 --> 15:34.660]  they would say, Hey RJ, I just knocked over a can of butane. Everyone's wondering what all that
[15:34.660 --> 15:38.740]  noise was. I don't have to fish it out. We don't need the tan. The torch is full. Uh, but thank
[15:38.740 --> 15:42.660]  you anyway. Uh, people were addressing me as RJ and I thought it was, it took me a minute to go
[15:42.660 --> 15:47.940]  arrest Jeff. Okay. The first time I was like, who is the RJ? But anyway, this person said RJ
[15:47.940 --> 15:53.780]  fills every episode with incredible information. The show always has a light, fun tone to it,
[15:53.780 --> 15:59.940]  which makes it a pleasure to listen to and learn from. They said every episode is filled with
[15:59.940 --> 16:03.460]  incredible information, even the ones when we get rambling Mike. So that's good to know.
[16:03.460 --> 16:05.700]  There's always a nugget of beauty in there somewhere.
[16:05.700 --> 16:10.740]  Always. I was saying a couple of episodes ago that I learned something from some random dude. We're
[16:10.820 --> 16:15.060]  talking about a grow. I was consulting for him and he made a comment and I was like, Oh, there's a
[16:15.060 --> 16:20.260]  nugget of information. No, if you keep your eyes and ears up, you learn shit in the strangest places.
[16:20.260 --> 16:24.580]  That's that's there's a grateful, not doing the grateful deadline. I'm not going to do it.
[16:25.140 --> 16:31.940]  I can't do it. Uh, then the part about, uh, show has a light, fun tone to it. Yeah, we do. We are
[16:31.940 --> 16:37.780]  not getting too serious here. And when I'm not here, Jeff tries. I, I did not like school. Jesse
[16:37.780 --> 16:42.900]  doesn't try with Jesse. Jesse, Jesse's doing his thing. We miss you, Jesse. Come be on the show.
[16:42.900 --> 16:46.820]  We need some more outdoor. We got to wait for the fucking winter to talk to him. Yeah. He's doing
[16:46.820 --> 16:51.780]  his growth thing. Uh, but it's like, yeah, I wasn't, I hated school, bro. I was not, I love
[16:51.780 --> 16:55.460]  learning, but I've had this conversation sitting at a desk kind of a person. So I'm glad you find
[16:55.460 --> 16:59.940]  it light and a pleasure to listen and learn from people tell me they fall asleep listening to my
[16:59.940 --> 17:03.940]  voice. And that makes me feel weird. But as long as you're enjoying the show, Hey, keep clicking,
[17:03.940 --> 17:11.060]  keep listening. Then he wraps it up or I don't know, could be a guy or a gal. So I'm not sure
[17:11.060 --> 17:16.260]  it could be a non-binary gendered person. It is 2020 by the way, uh, they wrap it up and they say,
[17:16.260 --> 17:22.180]  can I even say they, you can, they wrap it up by saying, thank you for all of your hard work,
[17:22.820 --> 17:27.300]  dude. Hey, you're very welcome. Thank you for listening to the show. Thank you for all the
[17:27.300 --> 17:31.220]  words of encouragement. Thank you for the great review. Thank you for the five stars.
[17:31.220 --> 17:35.540]  And, uh, thank you for giving me a fun name to make fun of for a couple of seconds. I hope
[17:35.540 --> 17:44.900]  you took that. Well, my new friend sub BIPS, skip it, shout out to skip it, skip it. And the whole
[17:44.900 --> 17:50.340]  skip it, skip it family. Mike's just being a little skip it, skip it. The little skip it,
[17:50.340 --> 17:54.980]  skip it. Are they just little skip it? Cause they didn't get the, the BIPS at the end. The
[17:55.140 --> 18:02.580]  BIPS. I don't know, man, this is getting strange. That kind of day. This ramble is brought to you
[18:02.580 --> 18:07.380]  by those kinds of dabs. All right. We've got one more marvelous review. This one says full of
[18:07.380 --> 18:12.180]  knowledge. You never know what it's going to say when you start to see when it says full of, and
[18:12.180 --> 18:14.820]  you can't open the whole comment when you're looking at your phone, you're like, Oh, what's
[18:14.820 --> 18:19.220]  this one going to say? It said full of knowledge. So I'm glad they went that direction. They gave
[18:19.220 --> 18:24.820]  us five stars. Uh, this one is left by a person who calls themselves purple thumb. Oh gee.
[18:27.060 --> 18:31.860]  Wash your hands. You wash your hands, bro. Um, maybe they hit it with a hammer and it's just
[18:31.860 --> 18:38.420]  all purple. Maybe they grow such good weed that they went beyond green and they got a purple thumb.
[18:39.380 --> 18:40.820]  That's not how color play works.
[18:44.260 --> 18:48.500]  Good. We comes out purple. Sometimes I do shout out to our friend, purple thumb. Oh,
[18:48.580 --> 18:54.900]  gee, we're just having fun. This was left on July 23rd. The review goes just like this.
[18:54.900 --> 18:58.820]  Ross the Jeff is an amazing podcaster and gardener. Thank you. I don't know that I've
[18:58.820 --> 19:03.620]  ever been called amazing before. That's a great word. I'm an amazing podcaster. I have a lot of
[19:03.620 --> 19:09.140]  fun podcasting. I'm 450 episodes and I'm comfortable. Uh, this microphone, these
[19:09.140 --> 19:13.540]  headphones, this little spot right here, this is the zone. Uh, nothing can go wrong right here.
[19:13.540 --> 19:18.260]  I feel so in the zone. So thank you. Uh, I also did a hundred episodes of another show. So this
[19:18.260 --> 19:23.620]  is probably 500 ish podcasts that I've produced. Right? Got comfy in front of the mic for sure.
[19:23.620 --> 19:28.020]  And you've built a really nice little setup here. It's a, I always laugh when I find a new show.
[19:28.020 --> 19:31.060]  One of the first things I find myself critiquing is the sound quality.
[19:32.020 --> 19:35.540]  Well, I'm glad you, uh, you enjoy that. I'm glad you appreciate it after listening to other shows.
[19:35.540 --> 19:39.620]  I didn't appreciate it nearly as much until I started listening to other shows.
[19:39.620 --> 19:45.140]  You can tell immediately which podcaster has taken the time to figure out how to get a good
[19:45.140 --> 19:49.700]  recording. And those that have just slapped together, I'll record it. And if it's on your
[19:49.700 --> 19:54.260]  phone, I won't listen. If you recorded it with your iPhone on the plane, I'm not going to listen
[19:54.260 --> 19:59.220]  to your show no matter who you are. Right. Yeah. Uh, there's more. It says, I love your energy and
[19:59.220 --> 20:04.180]  vast knowledge of breeding and growing. Uh, that's a great statement. Um, energy is hard to convey.
[20:04.180 --> 20:09.060]  So somebody picking up the good Rasta vibes through my voice that that means a lot, uh,
[20:09.060 --> 20:13.380]  vast knowledge. Hey there, that's a good compliment of breeding and growing. So they
[20:13.380 --> 20:17.540]  noticed that I could breed and grow. That's cool. I have learned so much from listening to you and I
[20:17.540 --> 20:23.780]  can't get enough. There's 451 episodes, man. You're going to get tired of me. Don't worry.
[20:23.780 --> 20:28.740]  Plus the Instagram live feeds, plus all the cannabis posts. You'll get enough of me eventually.
[20:28.740 --> 20:35.140]  Don't worry. Uh, then they say, thank you for sharing your fucking awesome bro. Excuse me for
[20:35.140 --> 20:38.820]  the grovelly voice at the end there. Uh, they said you're fucking awesome, bro. And then they
[20:38.820 --> 20:43.140]  throw a peace sign emoji in there. So that's a great review. A great comment. Thank you for that
[20:43.140 --> 20:48.180]  one. Thank you for the five stars. I'm big shout out to our friend. Appreciate purple thumb. Oh,
[20:48.180 --> 20:54.740]  gee, he can't get enough. Mike. That means we got to keep recording. I think it's a moral imperative.
[20:54.740 --> 20:59.620]  Got to keep going, bro. 300, 400. Keep it rolling. Just keep rolling. I'll tell you hit a thousand.
[21:00.900 --> 21:06.500]  Damn, dude. I thought I was doing okay. I'm only 45% of the way. I still remember how psyched we
[21:06.500 --> 21:12.100]  were for 100. Yeah. It felt like an accomplishment. And I look at it and I go, damn 450 episodes.
[21:12.100 --> 21:17.300]  That means 500 is just, just a few weeks. That's all that means. Weeks. Ladies and gentlemen,
[21:17.300 --> 21:22.500]  if you've got any ideas for episode 500, something you'd like me to feature or something you'd like
[21:22.500 --> 21:26.660]  to remember from the podcast, you're like, Hey, remember this time, send me some stuff.
[21:26.660 --> 21:31.060]  You can send me emails. My email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[21:31.060 --> 21:36.020]  Twitter is awesome. It's I don't check Twitter as much finding the mentions and shit is hard
[21:36.100 --> 21:42.420]  on Twitter for, I don't care as much, but you can tweet me. It's at GFYH podcast on Twitter. Email is
[21:42.420 --> 21:47.540]  your best bet. Grow from your heart at hotmail.com. Send me an email. Let me know what we should do
[21:47.540 --> 21:51.940]  for episode 500. If there's a clip that you would like me to feature or highlight and talk about,
[21:51.940 --> 21:55.860]  or if you'd like to tell me your favorite moments, let me know what to do. I don't have any ideas
[21:55.860 --> 22:01.460]  yet. It is time to start thinking about that. So your input will matter on that subject. Sometimes
[22:01.460 --> 22:06.740]  I just ignore your input, but this one, I will pay a lot of attention. Episode 500 is coming up.
[22:06.740 --> 22:12.100]  What do you think? All right. I want to thank everybody for the awesome, amazing, excellent,
[22:12.100 --> 22:18.820]  exciting, fantastic iTunes customer reviews. I had a good time. Everybody gave us five stars.
[22:18.820 --> 22:22.100]  We haven't had a hater in a little while, so we're doing pretty good. One person even said
[22:22.100 --> 22:28.100]  it don't make sense and still gave us five stars. Even when we confuse and we were some stars.
[22:28.100 --> 22:32.180]  We don't make any sense and we're still the best that they thought we could be.
[22:32.180 --> 22:36.340]  I appreciate that. Thank you guys. Let's see how long we've been going. We may have time to squeeze
[22:36.340 --> 22:39.620]  in one of these emails. Mike, do you want to squeeze in a listener email right quick? I think
[22:39.620 --> 22:44.340]  we should. All right. We're just getting warmed up here. We got all kinds of rambles for you.
[22:44.340 --> 23:00.570]  I'm glad you feel that way. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers,
[23:00.570 --> 23:04.970]  pimps and hoes, chicks and bros, since Mike was such in a good mood to get recording and said,
[23:04.970 --> 23:08.170]  we're just getting fired up, I decided we would take a couple of dabs.
[23:09.050 --> 23:13.050]  We did that. We fucking did that. Boy, that was pretty nice there. Shout out to our friends at
[23:13.050 --> 23:18.890]  Apothecary for the star dog dabs. We finished the jar or I would read you the potency, but I
[23:18.890 --> 23:23.050]  threw the jar away. It's already in the jar recollection. It is in the graveyard over there.
[23:24.010 --> 23:28.730]  It was good. It was potent. The label doesn't matter. It fucking worked. All right. I do have
[23:28.730 --> 23:34.890]  an email in front of me. We're going to read that. This one says, my question. Then it's real
[23:34.890 --> 23:39.290]  quick, right to the point. I've got a four by eight tent. I've got a thousand watt hydro crunch
[23:39.290 --> 23:44.650]  HPS air cooled hood. I've got a good visual started already. My next slide is a mini LED.
[23:45.370 --> 23:49.210]  All right. We've got a thousand watt. We've got a LED. We're doing good. We've got a lot of light.
[23:49.210 --> 23:56.090]  I've got an AC infinity eight inch fan and an eight inch filter. Sounds good so far. Automatic
[23:56.090 --> 24:01.610]  watering and drain set up. It sounds pretty smooth. Six, five gallon air pots. We've got
[24:01.610 --> 24:07.370]  cocoa and perlite. Description of the nudes. A couple of more things. Kind of explains what's
[24:07.370 --> 24:12.250]  going on. He says, this is my first time. I've been buying everything for a year since we bought
[24:12.250 --> 24:17.930]  this new house. The tent is upstairs. I plan on ducting through the floor downstairs. Will the
[24:17.930 --> 24:24.010]  smell be noticeable? If so, should I buy another fan and filter to scrub that air down there for a
[24:24.010 --> 24:31.050]  second time? Any advice? I just found your podcast and I love it. So he's got a grow tent upstairs.
[24:31.050 --> 24:34.970]  Let me address the just found the podcast and love it. Thank you. I appreciate that. I'm glad
[24:34.970 --> 24:39.130]  you just found the show. I hope somebody cool introduced you to the podcast. Give them a high
[24:39.130 --> 24:43.530]  five for me. Tell them thank you. And I'm glad that you love it. And I'm glad that I've got an
[24:43.530 --> 24:48.970]  opportunity to help you out. The tent's upstairs. He wants to run the ducting through the floor
[24:48.970 --> 24:55.290]  downstairs, but he's worried about the smell being noticeable. What do you think, Mike? There's
[24:55.290 --> 25:00.490]  a bunch of options available here. If you're worried about it, go ahead and add an extra
[25:00.490 --> 25:04.730]  blower. If you decide you don't need it, you've just got an extra filter for when the one you're
[25:04.730 --> 25:11.370]  using upstairs needs replacing. I would always say go extra if you are worried about aroma.
[25:11.370 --> 25:17.610]  Especially in prohibition land. Go extra. Go extra is the rule, not the exception.
[25:17.610 --> 25:21.050]  Right. They did not mention where they are, but it sounds like they need to be careful.
[25:22.730 --> 25:29.130]  Maybe if you're so worried about aroma, is there another option to duct that? Can you go up? Yeah.
[25:29.130 --> 25:33.770]  He automatically wants to go up. People are sometimes in the downstairs of your house.
[25:33.770 --> 25:39.370]  There's almost never anyone in your attic. Right. Even if your attic is just a shitty crawl space,
[25:39.370 --> 25:44.490]  it's way easier to push hot air up than it is down A. And there's way fewer people in your
[25:45.050 --> 25:51.130]  basement. And it sounds like you're ready to cut a six inch hole. So if you cut a six inch hole going
[25:51.130 --> 25:56.890]  up into a crawl space and save, if you cut a nice circle, save the circle, you can put that circle
[25:56.890 --> 26:00.890]  back. It's not that hard. We can teach you how to do that in the future. It's really easy. Put that
[26:00.890 --> 26:04.330]  circle back. If you're a handyman of any sorts, you've already got an idea how to do that.
[26:05.130 --> 26:09.930]  Going through harder to do in the floor, through the floor, there's probably a gap. You know what
[26:09.930 --> 26:13.530]  I mean? It's not going to be for maybe it depends on how old or where your house is.
[26:14.330 --> 26:19.290]  Should be a gap between that floor and the next ceiling. If it's finished, we don't know what's
[26:19.290 --> 26:23.290]  going on there, but you're going to, it's a finished area. I'm going to assume you're going
[26:23.290 --> 26:27.130]  to have to go. Now you're going in one and out the other. And then where's that air going to go?
[26:27.130 --> 26:30.090]  Are you just going to blow that? Now you're heating the floor.
[26:30.090 --> 26:34.810]  Downstairs. Yeah. I don't know if that downstairs is a living environment. Is that the basement?
[26:36.090 --> 26:39.370]  I don't know if this is some more where people are going to be. I wish I had a little bit more
[26:39.370 --> 26:43.770]  information. I would recommend venting it. If it's a basement, maybe, but that smell is going
[26:43.770 --> 26:48.890]  to come back up. It smells going to come back up. It's going to keep trying to rise. So if you're
[26:48.890 --> 26:53.450]  forcing it downstairs, you can scrub it all you want. That heat's still coming back up.
[26:53.450 --> 26:58.250]  So I would rethink it. I would try to go up into the crawl space. I would absolutely recommend
[26:58.250 --> 27:02.890]  the carbon filter attached to the ducting. So you've got your carbon filter, your blower,
[27:02.890 --> 27:06.330]  and your ducting, and you're running that to wherever you need it. I would recommend up.
[27:07.130 --> 27:12.090]  Then if you've got the opportunity and the budget, I don't know what your situation is.
[27:12.090 --> 27:16.410]  There are so many variables to this question that we're going to do our best with what we've got.
[27:16.410 --> 27:22.170]  I would hang another carbon scrubber in the grow. If you've got a tent, I would put it in the tent.
[27:22.170 --> 27:27.290]  If you can hang another one in there just to scrub the air, that is just simply going to clean
[27:27.290 --> 27:31.610]  the smell out of there. Then you've got that one clean in, then it's going to suck through
[27:31.610 --> 27:37.770]  that other filter. It's getting cleaned twice. Or if you can put that second filter in the attic
[27:37.770 --> 27:40.250]  where that air is getting dumped. That's where I'd put it.
[27:40.250 --> 27:46.010]  That is another great option. If I had an inline... I mean, my ideal option for it,
[27:46.010 --> 27:51.370]  say I had a two-story house in a grow in an upstairs bedroom, I'd run that into the attic.
[27:52.330 --> 27:56.810]  There'd be a carbon filter at the front of the line in the tent where the pole was starting from,
[27:57.530 --> 28:01.450]  suck that through the light, out the ceiling.
[28:01.450 --> 28:05.770]  He's got air-cooled hoods, so we need to keep in mind the air-cooled hood. You're going to want to
[28:05.770 --> 28:12.570]  go carbon filter, duct, air-cooled hood, in, air-cooled hood, out. Then it continues just
[28:12.570 --> 28:19.370]  like normal, but make sure that that is sealed up as tightly as you can seal every joint on there.
[28:19.370 --> 28:25.690]  It's always tough having a beautiful new light hood. You slide the brand new ducting on it.
[28:26.410 --> 28:30.650]  You slide in that nice hose clamp. You get it tightened down just how you like it.
[28:31.290 --> 28:36.730]  It looks so beautiful. Then you have to get ghetto as fuck and grab your roll of duct tape
[28:36.730 --> 28:41.450]  and really seal that bitch. When you're done, it's going to look a little ghetto,
[28:41.450 --> 28:44.890]  but you're going to solve your air leaks and your life's going to run smoother.
[28:44.890 --> 28:51.370]  But I'd run that exhaust coming out of my light hood, out of my tent, up into the attic.
[28:51.370 --> 28:57.690]  Then I would have another inline scrubbing, another inline CO2. I'm sorry, an inline carbon
[28:57.690 --> 29:06.650]  filter in the attic. The filter is going to hold a lot of heat just as it's pulling it out of the
[29:06.650 --> 29:13.210]  air. That air processes through all of that carbon powder. It's going to suck out the smell and it's
[29:13.210 --> 29:17.450]  going to retain some of that heat, not like a fire source or anything like that. But it's going to-
[29:18.170 --> 29:19.530]  It'll slow it down and cool it off.
[29:19.850 --> 29:23.290]  It'll cool the air a little bit. Surface matter will heat. The carbon will absorb the heat.
[29:23.290 --> 29:27.050]  But that heat's going to maintain. If you're adding a little heat to your attic, it's not
[29:27.050 --> 29:33.290]  that big a deal. But if you're pushing warm pot smell filled air into your basement,
[29:33.290 --> 29:37.610]  that's just going to rise right back up into your floor and back into your living space.
[29:37.610 --> 29:42.570]  Depending on the season and your location, you may want to direct that heat right down
[29:42.570 --> 29:47.690]  into your bedroom or something. But- I mean, on top of the other benefits to running it
[29:47.690 --> 29:54.330]  into the attic for people who are never up there, the landlord's never going to want to get up there,
[29:54.330 --> 30:01.690]  none of that shit. There's usually an air vent or two to let heat out of the attic already in place
[30:01.690 --> 30:06.570]  for you to piggyback on. And it looks natural to have heat coming out of the roof of your house
[30:06.570 --> 30:11.850]  and not out of the back basement window. That'll get noticeable. If you've got a grow at the back
[30:11.850 --> 30:15.690]  of your house and you've got some ducting coming out of the window, have you ever gone out there
[30:15.690 --> 30:20.730]  the day that it snows and you look and see that there's that big 12-inch fucking arc where there's
[30:20.730 --> 30:24.730]  no snow by your window because your hot blower is going there? That is something that people
[30:24.730 --> 30:28.330]  should think about. That's a side rant. But let's get back on track here to our friend with the
[30:28.330 --> 30:33.530]  carbon filter question. Another thing you're going to want to keep in mind, you're new at this,
[30:34.650 --> 30:40.330]  something that you haven't thought about, when you harvest these plants, it is going to stink
[30:40.330 --> 30:46.250]  twice as badly as it did while they were growing. It is going to be odoriferous. It's going to be
[30:46.250 --> 30:51.930]  tremendous. As soon as you start cutting into them, you unlock all of the smell. That's when
[30:51.930 --> 30:57.450]  it's really going to stink. So if you think it stinks during the grow, it's going to double
[30:57.450 --> 31:02.010]  during harvest time. Be prepared for that. That's when you'll really find out if you needed that
[31:02.010 --> 31:05.450]  second filter. Where are you going to harvest? Most people need more filtration.
[31:05.450 --> 31:10.090]  Yeah. Where are you going to harvest? Are you going to harvest upstairs where the tent is?
[31:10.090 --> 31:13.130]  Are you going to hang these plants in the tent so they can dry and cure there?
[31:13.850 --> 31:17.450]  Think about that. You've got a lot of time. You've got an entire veg phase. You probably
[31:17.450 --> 31:21.450]  got four to six weeks of veg. You got at least eight or nine weeks of flower. You've got time
[31:21.450 --> 31:26.090]  to think about it, but start thinking about it because it is going to stink.
[31:26.090 --> 31:32.490]  Another thing you can think about is things to distract people's noses. What other options do
[31:32.490 --> 31:37.930]  you have? Can you put some roses outside? Can you put lilacs outside? Things like that will distract
[31:37.930 --> 31:43.210]  your nose. Can you put things indoors that will change your mind? Can you maybe have one of those
[31:43.210 --> 31:47.610]  little spritzers that shoots out the fucking air freshener every 30 seconds right by the front door?
[31:47.610 --> 31:53.210]  Have that near every door. So it goes, and it may smell like pink baby powder. I don't know what that
[31:53.210 --> 31:58.090]  weird smell is, but it's better than somebody realizing that your whole neighborhood smells
[31:58.090 --> 32:03.850]  like ganja because of you. Right. Depending on where you live, smell could be your Achilles
[32:03.850 --> 32:10.970]  heel for sure. Yep. Smell complaints are one of the top three. I've said number one, but stats may
[32:10.970 --> 32:15.050]  have changed from things I've seen recently. Stupidity is the number one cause lately.
[32:15.770 --> 32:21.930]  Odor complaints are one of the top three causes of people being in trouble for a cannabis grow
[32:21.930 --> 32:25.290]  in this area over the past several months from what I've paid attention to.
[32:26.250 --> 32:31.930]  Our local sheriff, when a group was trying to ban legal cannabis businesses,
[32:32.490 --> 32:36.970]  he got together with the local anti-pot group and a couple of parents groups
[32:37.530 --> 32:42.490]  and just had them all walk around and just be aware when they're out in neighborhoods
[32:42.490 --> 32:50.570]  sniffing. And if they smell marijuana to note the address, and then he coincided going and
[32:50.570 --> 32:54.890]  checking on all those addresses with the announcement of a ballot effort to shut the industry down.
[32:56.010 --> 33:01.290]  And that's literally where they got the list of addresses to go fuck with was just neighborhood
[33:01.370 --> 33:07.690]  watch and PTA people walking around and walking their dogs at night going, there's a strong smell
[33:07.690 --> 33:12.330]  at the corner of first and Johnson. And I think it's coming from the house on the corner of first
[33:12.330 --> 33:16.490]  street. So I'm going to write that address out of my little book and turn it in at the next
[33:17.610 --> 33:21.690]  neighborhood watch meeting. And then honestly, there was just a skunk in the yard at first and
[33:21.690 --> 33:26.970]  Johnson, and now they're getting harassed. It was actually a third and Johnson, they just got a
[33:26.970 --> 33:31.530]  shitty nose. Well, then the cops go when the cops get that call, they go to the door and knock.
[33:32.570 --> 33:37.290]  And like, if the cop smells weed in the front yard and you freak out and say, fuck off,
[33:37.290 --> 33:40.490]  get a warrant and slam the door in their face. They go, okay. They come back with a warrant and
[33:40.490 --> 33:45.690]  they send you to jail. Honestly, what's happening now a lot with these bus, this is kind of random,
[33:45.690 --> 33:49.130]  but the people don't know the law here and they just go, it's legal. Come check it out.
[33:49.690 --> 33:54.170]  And the cops like, sweet. Yeah. I love gardens. Let me see yours. And they go in the back. The
[33:54.170 --> 33:58.250]  cop counts to 12 and goes, hi, that could keep counting. If I wanted you're under arrest.
[33:59.690 --> 34:03.850]  I have heard them have a little bit of grace. And if you've got like two or three extra,
[34:03.850 --> 34:07.290]  they've allowed you to pick your favorites. If you don't rely on that,
[34:07.290 --> 34:12.330]  if you've got one or two or three or four or five over, I think I would stop at three.
[34:13.050 --> 34:20.650]  I wouldn't go. I'd stick with the hard number of 12 if I were you, but they just did a bust
[34:20.650 --> 34:26.250]  here locally where the press was happy to report the homeboy had 26. And it's like,
[34:27.690 --> 34:32.650]  it's not that many plants. But they also inflate the numbers. We've done the cop math episode where
[34:32.650 --> 34:39.690]  that's $374,000 worth of product. That was probably fucking enough for seven fucking
[34:39.690 --> 34:44.410]  middle schools to overdose on. The news fucking beefed that up. I was laying into one of the
[34:44.410 --> 34:49.210]  news agencies the other day on social media. There was just a big other drug bust up North of here.
[34:49.930 --> 34:54.890]  And the article reporting it listed like 70 pounds of this and 20 pounds of that.
[34:54.890 --> 34:58.810]  And it's fucking, they're talking about the heroin and shit. But there's no like dumb
[34:58.810 --> 35:04.650]  piggy estimate in the top where the reporter interviews some idiot guarding the yellow tape
[35:04.650 --> 35:09.610]  and they go, this is worth blank millions of dollars. There was none of that. And it's like,
[35:10.570 --> 35:16.170]  why is that always in the headline for the pop bust? It's an advertisement for broke people
[35:16.170 --> 35:22.010]  in Florida. They're like, wait a second. All we have to do is get to Colorado and secure a rental
[35:22.010 --> 35:28.250]  home and we could be running a multimillion dollar business from home. Let's do that instead of being
[35:28.250 --> 35:34.730]  Florida. Every time they do one of these fucking reports, it drives me bananas. And they always
[35:34.730 --> 35:38.410]  lie about the fucking numbers. Yeah. Weed's not worth shit here anymore.
[35:38.410 --> 35:40.650]  But here the cops find real drugs. I guess it is there.
[35:40.650 --> 35:44.650]  And there's no, that part of the report doesn't exist anymore all of a sudden.
[35:44.650 --> 35:49.610]  They just forgot to ask that follow-up question or the cop forgot to brag about that this time.
[35:50.490 --> 35:54.250]  Or more likely it's just the cop has no idea what other drugs are worth.
[35:55.130 --> 35:58.490]  And it's not like they know how much weed's worth, but they've got a lie they're comfortable
[35:58.490 --> 36:01.850]  telling when it comes to weed. They figured out some sort of fake algorithm.
[36:02.730 --> 36:05.930]  So stay within your plan count. I think that was the moral of that story. I'm not sure where the
[36:05.930 --> 36:09.770]  fuck we went with that one. Mike, where were we? Buy another carbon filter, dude. That's what we're
[36:09.770 --> 36:14.330]  trying to say. There you go. The main question is, will the smell be noticeable? Yes.
[36:14.970 --> 36:18.730]  The smell, the heat, the weird humidity, all of that stuff. You're going to be like,
[36:18.730 --> 36:22.970]  what is that? It's different in here. A good test if you're a grower and you
[36:22.970 --> 36:29.130]  want to know if your growth stinks, go away for 24 hours or as long as you can be away.
[36:29.130 --> 36:34.250]  Go rent a shitty hotel room just long enough to take a good shower. If you've only got an hour,
[36:34.970 --> 36:39.130]  go somewhere else, shower, get the smell out of your head, go eat spicy food.
[36:39.130 --> 36:42.970]  If you're going to go somewhere weird and take a shower, make sure to take your significant other
[36:42.970 --> 36:47.530]  with you or give them some sort of clear heads up what's going on. This could be weird. Where'd
[36:47.530 --> 36:51.450]  you go? I went to a hotel and took a shower. Oh yeah, I bet you did, motherfucker. Where you been?
[36:52.570 --> 36:57.050]  But you got to get out for all... I remember working a trim job at one point and we all
[36:57.050 --> 37:02.650]  just got up to go to lunch. Didn't think nothing of it. And we're sitting down at the table,
[37:02.650 --> 37:08.410]  we've all got our menus, a couple of minutes go by, come by and get our drink orders. And that
[37:08.410 --> 37:12.890]  went a little weird. It wasn't just like iced tea for me. I had a conversation. There was a little
[37:12.890 --> 37:17.770]  more awkwardness. And before our drink showed up, the manager showed up and was like, get the fuck
[37:17.770 --> 37:25.530]  out. You guys cannot be here. You stink so bad. This wasn't recent. This wasn't us wearing badges.
[37:27.690 --> 37:34.490]  And we definitely shouldn't have been there. It's dumb luck law enforcement didn't happen past us,
[37:34.570 --> 37:40.490]  or somebody who knew what we were up to followed us back to where we were to help themselves to
[37:40.490 --> 37:44.570]  whatever later after we all headed home for the night. It was just dumb luck. We were just
[37:44.570 --> 37:51.530]  exhausted after a long week at work and needed a fucking sandwich. But the smell was so strong,
[37:51.530 --> 37:55.290]  it was freaking out a whole restaurant of people, but none of us could smell it. We'd all gotten
[37:55.290 --> 38:01.050]  completely nosed deaf. You got to leave and be gone for a minute, get your head clean,
[38:01.050 --> 38:04.570]  get some food in you and then come back to it. And you'll be able to smell it a lot better.
[38:05.130 --> 38:09.290]  I've driven up to friends' houses and gotten to their driveway and been like, oh,
[38:09.290 --> 38:14.250]  fuck. Time to have a conversation with my buddy. Yeah. You walk in and you're like, hey, bro,
[38:15.290 --> 38:20.650]  I can smell you from the driveway. I don't know why I turned into Dave Attell when I said-
[38:20.650 --> 38:25.130]  Your mailman knows what's up. The drive, I can smell you from the driveway.
[38:25.130 --> 38:29.610]  You and me were headed somewhere one day. It was for a harvester in the summer.
[38:31.050 --> 38:34.970]  We were just stopping by while they were getting ready to start harvesting. And we got to the
[38:34.970 --> 38:39.130]  corner of the block. And this person was three or four houses deep in the block.
[38:40.090 --> 38:44.330]  And I know what you're talking about. And you hit the brakes and started giggling.
[38:44.330 --> 38:47.930]  And I looked over and then the smell hit me and we both just started laughing.
[38:47.930 --> 38:53.850]  And it's like, yeah, that's where we're headed. Yep. I used to pull up to one of our friends'
[38:53.850 --> 38:59.770]  houses and you could smell for a half a block away that he was blasting BHO. There's a very
[38:59.770 --> 39:06.250]  distinct aroma when people are making BHO concentrates. And I could smell that for at
[39:06.250 --> 39:12.810]  least two blocks. It was amazingly intense. So you will need a carbon filter. And I don't
[39:12.810 --> 39:17.610]  recommend blowing that into your main area, your living quarters or anything like that, because
[39:17.610 --> 39:22.410]  that is going to bleed into your living quarters. The humidity is going to come along with that
[39:22.410 --> 39:26.010]  heat. It's not just going to be smell. You're blowing out heat, you're blowing out humidity,
[39:26.010 --> 39:30.810]  you're blowing out aroma. It's going to be windy. It's just going to change things. I would not
[39:30.810 --> 39:34.330]  recommend blowing that. And I don't know, you said downstairs. I don't know if that's going into your
[39:34.330 --> 39:38.650]  basement, into your bedroom, into the fish tank room. I don't know what you got going on there.
[39:39.770 --> 39:44.090]  If you're too near where your furnace is, I know people that have fucked up how their
[39:44.090 --> 39:49.850]  furnace works. I've done that. Because of too much air pressure coming out or not enough.
[39:49.850 --> 39:54.170]  I have sucked out the pilot light by having too strong of a blower too near the furnace. So I
[39:54.250 --> 39:59.930]  kept sucking out the pilot light. I have had back drafts where my ducting was blowing air up into a
[39:59.930 --> 40:03.770]  vent and disrupting everything. And it was triggering it, making it think I was getting a CO2
[40:04.490 --> 40:08.730]  backflow. So it was shutting off a furnace in one place. I've seen a lot of weird things.
[40:09.610 --> 40:13.530]  Don't try to tie in your ducting to existing ducting either. That will create those,
[40:13.530 --> 40:17.690]  that ducting that was ran professionally, they only accounted for that. So don't add yours.
[40:18.410 --> 40:24.570]  A lot of people vent out into like an air dump space. And I've seen some spaces that have been
[40:24.570 --> 40:29.930]  neglected for repeat growth cycles where no one's bothered to enter that space.
[40:30.810 --> 40:36.730]  It's just the ducting goes to the wall and the thought for three years, five years.
[40:38.650 --> 40:45.530]  And I've seen some horrendous, horrendous things in those spaces. So take some time and really
[40:45.530 --> 40:51.770]  think out your whole air system from start to finish before you really go to town and always
[40:51.770 --> 40:55.770]  add an extra carbon filter. If you think you got enough, add one more. I think we've covered this
[40:55.770 --> 41:01.690]  part, but you just put me off on a random thought. When you're going to put up ducting, if it goes
[41:01.690 --> 41:08.490]  outside at all, put some sort of a cover on the end of it. I have seen snakes and shit, dude.
[41:08.490 --> 41:12.490]  You knew exactly where I was going. I've seen snakes climb into the ducting, into people's
[41:12.490 --> 41:16.570]  grow lights, wrap around a grow light while the grow light was off. It must've gone off.
[41:16.570 --> 41:19.850]  And the snake was like, oh, warm. And it was just warm enough for him to cuddle.
[41:19.850 --> 41:24.170]  The next day that fucker clicks on and that snake didn't have the speed to get out of there. And he
[41:24.170 --> 41:28.650]  was cooked and wrapped around the grow light. It was one of the most interestingly fucking
[41:28.650 --> 41:33.370]  disgusting things I've ever seen. Fried snake around a light bulb. I remember the first time
[41:33.370 --> 41:39.210]  I saw someone let ladybugs go in a sealed environment with the only out was through
[41:39.210 --> 41:44.490]  the carbon filter and through the hooded lights. I remember taking this fool's light down and
[41:44.490 --> 41:51.850]  shaking handfuls, fucking handfuls. Like I'm making snowballs with dead ladybugs.
[41:51.850 --> 41:58.970]  Dead ladybugs stink so bad. It's like a dead ladybug genocide. I felt so creepy. I've got
[41:58.970 --> 42:04.170]  this light hood and I'm fucking shaking it. And it's like a giant salt shaker with dead ladybugs
[42:04.170 --> 42:08.970]  just fucking pouring out of it. I'm not a fan of ladybugs. I don't think they're a cost
[42:09.050 --> 42:13.450]  effective in a garden. They'll fly directly into the fan.
[42:14.170 --> 42:17.210]  They're a fun way for the grow store to make money on your ass.
[42:19.210 --> 42:25.690]  But really think through your air. I see a lot of flaws with that. And a lot of people get caught
[42:25.690 --> 42:31.690]  because they didn't properly vent and scrub their air or they don't change their filters. They buy
[42:31.690 --> 42:37.530]  a carbon filter in January and two years later they're running the same carbon filter and it's
[42:37.530 --> 42:42.570]  not doing anything but slowing down their airflow. Check on that in about a year. Check on it 13,
[42:42.570 --> 42:49.450]  14 months. You get about a year. 10 months, 14 months, replace it. I always go a little bigger.
[42:49.450 --> 42:54.570]  I always buy a bigger filter and blower than I need for my space because I know. I've had people
[42:54.570 --> 42:58.010]  tell me when they're working on the backyard or something like, sir, you got a skunk back here.
[42:58.010 --> 43:03.210]  And I'm like, nope, that's the grateful dog. That's not a skunk, that is some skunk, sir.
[43:04.090 --> 43:10.890]  There's a great photo of, you made me think of it earlier. It's out of Amsterdam from the early
[43:10.890 --> 43:16.490]  thousands. I'm sure it's been memed since where you see a hundred roofs and two of them don't
[43:16.490 --> 43:23.850]  have any snow. It's like, yeah, got to think it all the way through. We know where to raid today.
[43:25.210 --> 43:27.450]  That sounds like a terrible spot to end the podcast, but I-
[43:27.450 --> 43:31.130]  Let's do the next email because that one took a weird trip. We're going to stay on track for
[43:31.130 --> 43:34.410]  the last one. I don't know if I have a short one, Mike. I think all of the next emails are
[43:34.410 --> 43:38.010]  going to get us onto a long path that are going to have us talking more than I want to be doing
[43:38.010 --> 43:42.250]  right now. Cut it into two shows. Well, here, let's go on this one. This is great. This one
[43:42.250 --> 43:46.810]  says, he says, we'll make it two shows. We're just going to keep going, bro. Mike's on a roll,
[43:46.810 --> 43:51.930]  so we're going to keep podcasting. This one says, and I'll keep going forever. It says Rasta Jeff.
[43:51.930 --> 43:55.610]  It doesn't really say it like that. There's only one R in the Rasta. I think I put a lot of Rs in
[43:55.610 --> 44:00.650]  there. I just wanted to drop you a line from my couch in Florida. What's up, bro? If you're
[44:00.650 --> 44:04.650]  having a good time on your couch in Florida, sorry, we bashed Florida folks a little bit ago.
[44:04.650 --> 44:10.810]  You're from there. You know exactly what we meant. It goes on to say, I ran a single plant of lemon
[44:10.810 --> 44:18.090]  Jeffrey in my tiny closet tent. I let it go for, you ready for this, Mike? A little over 11 weeks.
[44:18.810 --> 44:23.850]  Yeah. What happened? We're going to get down to that. He said, I was watching those trichomes.
[44:23.850 --> 44:28.170]  I'm down to the last jar and it has been curing for two months.
[44:28.170 --> 44:28.810]  Nice.
[44:28.810 --> 44:34.730]  Flowered for 11 weeks and cured for two months. He said, it's such a different smoke now.
[44:35.530 --> 44:42.810]  The lemon candy got melted into some sort of marmalade syrup flavor. You guys, I wish you
[44:42.810 --> 44:47.770]  could see the look on Mike's face. Mike rarely gets excited about cannabis aromas and flavors.
[44:47.770 --> 44:51.210]  He looks like he wants to lick the microphone like it's a fucking ice cream cone right now.
[44:51.210 --> 44:54.250]  There's never enough of it for me to have it around for two months. I'm jelly.
[44:54.250 --> 44:56.170]  Yeah. The lemon Jeffrey does go quite quickly.
[44:57.290 --> 44:58.410]  Especially in my house.
[44:58.410 --> 45:01.850]  Yeah. Well, we got to get you a, yeah, we got to get things set up for you so you can have that
[45:01.850 --> 45:04.090]  around. That's what we got to do. Anybody want my nephew?
[45:06.010 --> 45:11.130]  Do I edit that or do I leave that? That's a judgment call. So we've got a marmalade syrup
[45:11.130 --> 45:12.810]  flavor. Comes with furniture.
[45:16.490 --> 45:18.330]  Marmalade syrup for a flavor.
[45:18.330 --> 45:23.850]  I got to leave that in now. There's no smooth edit point. It had started out so bright.
[45:23.850 --> 45:26.890]  The transfer, and I know what he means by bright because I see bright green,
[45:26.890 --> 45:31.930]  bright yellow flavors in my mouth. I see them in my mouth. I do. I've got a magical tongue.
[45:33.530 --> 45:39.450]  Sounds fucking so weird when I say it like that, but maybe it's my nose. The transformation has
[45:39.450 --> 45:45.850]  been a pleasure to witness. This mature lemon Jeffrey still gets the mind going fast. I love
[45:45.850 --> 45:51.290]  that. That's one of my favorite things about it, but it's dreamier and perfectly suited for a
[45:51.290 --> 45:57.530]  Sunday afternoon. Dreamier. That's what I like about the lemon stuff. It gives you that fog.
[45:57.530 --> 46:01.450]  You're just like, huh, I don't know what's going on around me. What's in front of me is perfectly
[46:01.450 --> 46:05.930]  cool. To the left and right, I don't give a shit. That's part of what I like about that.
[46:05.930 --> 46:09.930]  So he wraps it up. He says, I look forward to the next run. Hey, me too, bro. I'm curious if you
[46:09.930 --> 46:15.050]  have a clone or if you're running a brand new seed. That's one of the two things that really
[46:15.050 --> 46:18.890]  struck me about the start of this was how did you end up with one? Did you-
[46:19.450 --> 46:21.370]  Well, he bought a six pack and only ran the one.
[46:21.370 --> 46:26.570]  Yeah. Did you buy a six pack and pop one? Did your friend buy a six pack and give you one?
[46:26.570 --> 46:30.490]  A tiny closet tent. So he probably bought a sixer or got a freebie or something. We have
[46:30.490 --> 46:33.530]  no idea who this guy is. We've got his name here, but we're not going to say it out loud. Oh,
[46:33.530 --> 46:36.890]  it says no names. It actually says that in the message. So you can't say his name. Yeah,
[46:36.890 --> 46:37.530]  what's up, brother? It's good to-
[46:37.530 --> 46:42.090]  The other thing I really liked about this, and it hasn't happened to me pretty much since
[46:42.090 --> 46:49.210]  legalization, but I haven't had a bunch of one strain as my primary smoke source
[46:49.930 --> 46:57.290]  for a long period of time. I did my own sort of half-assed outdoor home grow at one point and
[46:57.290 --> 47:04.570]  ended up with a fuck ton of blueberry was the last time I did this. And when I got to the fourth QP
[47:04.570 --> 47:09.690]  bag that I harvested, it was light years different than the first one I smoked.
[47:09.690 --> 47:10.890]  Oh yeah. Yeah.
[47:10.890 --> 47:17.130]  But that was the last time I got to really enjoy how a strain matures as I worked through a bunch
[47:17.130 --> 47:22.810]  of it personally. And that was fun and I miss it. And I hadn't realized how much until you were
[47:22.810 --> 47:26.810]  reading that. Right. Now we just go to the store and we get an eighth of this, an eighth of that,
[47:26.810 --> 47:32.410]  an eighth of this, a quarter of that. I always get three or four eighths or quarters. And then
[47:32.410 --> 47:37.770]  I get home and I immediately grab the smallest two nugs out of each and jam them into my grinder
[47:38.490 --> 47:44.330]  and make a little, a combo bowl. And I even try sometimes I do and go with a, B and C
[47:44.330 --> 47:49.130]  independently, but it's when there's two nugs, a, B and C left. And then I'm like,
[47:49.130 --> 47:52.490]  oh fuck. I haven't done that with these yet. And then I get to it.
[47:53.290 --> 47:57.530]  I like to dab my concentrates individually, but occasionally I'll find like, sometimes I want to
[47:57.530 --> 48:03.210]  take a big, like I get the crystals. So I'll have crystals and I make little combos, but I prefer,
[48:03.210 --> 48:07.370]  I like to see the, I'm going to take three dabs anyway. So I could take a dab of this,
[48:07.370 --> 48:10.890]  a dab of that. With concentrates, I usually keep them separate at home, but with herb,
[48:11.450 --> 48:17.130]  it's all a mixed green. That salad, that's how you get full cannabinoids, full turps, all of it.
[48:17.130 --> 48:21.370]  Yep. All right. I just like that flavor. I'm a, I'm a picky bitch for the flavor.
[48:21.370 --> 48:26.490]  So this dude grew lemon Jeffrey for 11 weeks, bro. I think I've gone. That's intense. And I
[48:26.490 --> 48:30.730]  love that they were watching the trichomes. This is why they did it. I think I've gone like 72 or
[48:30.730 --> 48:36.890]  74 days. I don't think I've ever gone 77. That's 11 weeks at 77 days. I don't think I've done that.
[48:36.890 --> 48:42.730]  Uh, that's pretty awesome. Um, and thank you. Uh, I want to know, excuse all the throat clearing.
[48:42.730 --> 48:47.130]  Are you going to grow another seed? Do you have a clone of this one? And yeah, what's next, bro?
[48:47.130 --> 48:49.610]  What's next is he's going to send pictures of the next grow.
[48:50.570 --> 48:54.410]  If, uh, if they're already two months into this one, Karen, the next one ought to be just about
[48:54.410 --> 48:58.890]  done. I like the way you think Mike, Hey, our friend who doesn't want their name right on the
[48:58.890 --> 49:02.490]  show. I want to thank you for the great email. Thank you for growing the lemon Jeffrey. Um,
[49:03.610 --> 49:07.050]  yeah, come smoke a joint with me, bro. I want to know what that tastes like. All right. Before Mike
[49:07.050 --> 49:11.450]  tries to get us into reading another email, I'm going to the show. No, no, no. Put down the
[49:11.450 --> 49:15.930]  caffeine. We got to wrap it up next week. Yeah. We'll get Mike back. He's enthusiastic and excited.
[49:15.930 --> 49:19.770]  So that means we'll get him here on the show again. I've got, uh, I had somebody hit me up
[49:19.770 --> 49:25.530]  on social media and ask specifically if I would cover a piece of national press, um, in detail
[49:25.610 --> 49:30.730]  on the show. Um, that was the back of my shoe on the support bar for the chair.
[49:30.730 --> 49:33.130]  Sound like puppies screeching or something that was so weird.
[49:33.130 --> 49:36.890]  All right. It was a nice little unexpected. So we've got a specific request.
[49:36.890 --> 49:43.530]  And there's, uh, there's been some federal, some federal interestings in, uh, a couple of state
[49:43.530 --> 49:47.610]  statewide initiative interestings that, uh, I would like to share with the listeners.
[49:47.610 --> 49:53.850]  So you better get some Google documents. We'll do a more info heavy Mike and Jeff show here
[49:53.850 --> 49:57.450]  in the near future. You heard it from the horse. I think I said that last time. So
[49:57.450 --> 50:01.530]  I didn't mean to call it just now, but I've been called worse today. I'm sure.
[50:02.570 --> 50:05.770]  All right. Hey, dude, thanks for coming and hanging out. This is a really cool episode.
[50:05.770 --> 50:08.330]  We just recorded a solid hour. People are going to enjoy that.
[50:09.050 --> 50:15.770]  I, uh, thanks for listening to everybody. It, uh, it means a lot to us that you're still listening.
[50:15.770 --> 50:19.370]  Hit us up on social media. Let us know what you thought. That's what I was just about to say.
[50:19.370 --> 50:27.530]  Where can they harass you? Um, in public say it to his face at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter. Um,
[50:27.530 --> 50:33.370]  and, uh, Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook, Nemo punk 15 on the Twitter and Pueblo
[50:33.370 --> 50:37.530]  for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook. You had more to say, keep going. You can hit me up on
[50:37.530 --> 50:43.130]  either of those. Um, I've been getting a lot of Instagram follows, especially after the DGC
[50:43.130 --> 50:48.330]  seven 10 cup. Um, I appreciate all the Instagram love, but you're not going to get anything out
[50:48.330 --> 50:52.170]  of following me there. Yeah. He doesn't push it to Instagram. But every now and then I take
[50:52.170 --> 50:58.010]  a picture of the table that we're recording at and that's pretty much it. It's an exciting table.
[50:58.010 --> 51:02.010]  It's one of the more bad-ass kitchen tables I've ever been at. All right, Mike, thanks for
[51:02.010 --> 51:06.410]  hanging out, bro. Oh yeah, man. Thank you for listening. Thanks for having me, Jeff. Anytime,
[51:06.410 --> 51:09.450]  dude. You're always welcome. That door is always, well, I was going to say it's always unlocked,
[51:09.450 --> 51:12.410]  but that's not true. I locked that shit, but you know, when you call, I open it.
[51:13.530 --> 51:17.370]  That's appreciated. You ready for the outro? Let's do it. I'll turn on your mics. You could
