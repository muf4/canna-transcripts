[00:00.320 --> 00:18.680]  All right, here we go.
[00:18.680 --> 00:20.360]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:20.360 --> 00:21.360]  I'm your host.

[00:23.120 --> 00:28.160]  This is episode 709 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:28.160 --> 00:31.840]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about the evolution of dabbing.
[00:31.840 --> 00:35.400]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great

[01:20.560 --> 01:26.920]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:26.920 --> 01:29.640]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:29.640 --> 01:33.840]  You know I do include that link in the show notes and the video description to make it
[01:33.840 --> 01:37.520]  nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:37.520 --> 01:39.520]  We made it through the intro part.
[01:39.520 --> 01:42.640]  The next episode, you guys, will be the 710 episode.
[01:42.640 --> 01:47.640]  We're going to talk about live rosin, about making rosin, about pressing rosin at home,
[01:47.640 --> 01:49.560]  about growing specifically for rosin.
[01:49.560 --> 01:55.280]  I do have our friends Pedro from Pedro's Grow Room, Mr. Rosin's Neighborhood.
[01:55.280 --> 01:57.760]  Everyone is legal fuckers.
[01:57.760 --> 02:00.460]  Also we've got another amazing concentrate maker.
[02:00.460 --> 02:03.040]  Our buddy Rosin Ryan will be on the next episode.
[02:03.040 --> 02:08.120]  I thought since the next episode is the 710 show, this should be kind of the warm up for
[02:08.120 --> 02:09.560]  the 710 episode.
[02:09.560 --> 02:12.800]  I focused mainly on making concentrates on the next show.
[02:12.800 --> 02:16.840]  This one will be about how we got to this point in the concentrate world.
[02:16.840 --> 02:18.320]  I'm in Colorado here.
[02:18.320 --> 02:19.920]  I guess I'm going to evolve right into it.
[02:19.920 --> 02:21.520]  I'm in Colorado here.
[02:21.520 --> 02:27.680]  I feel like I was on the forefront, excuse me, I was on the forefront, in the scene,
[02:27.680 --> 02:29.920]  if you will, of the evolution of concentrates.
[02:29.920 --> 02:35.320]  I was there when some of the very first concentrates were put out, first things were made.
[02:35.320 --> 02:41.000]  I got to try some of the very first new products that people had never seen before.
[02:41.000 --> 02:42.560]  My friends were making live resin.
[02:42.560 --> 02:47.440]  They were the innovators of the official inception of live resin.
[02:47.760 --> 02:53.160]  They were pulling the live resin out of the Obedose machine and smoking it before it was
[02:53.160 --> 02:55.200]  even purged or completely processed.
[02:55.200 --> 02:56.200]  They had a special name for that.
[02:56.200 --> 03:00.880]  I was smoking that stuff, but I started by smoking some Funky Brown Goop.
[03:00.880 --> 03:06.440]  I feel like I've been around since a part of the evolution of concentrates here in Colorado,
[03:06.440 --> 03:07.440]  this new dab evolution.
[03:07.440 --> 03:12.600]  Of course, there is that old bubble hash, the old stuff that the older, the pressed
[03:12.600 --> 03:15.960]  hash, the funky hash, the older guys like, the old clientele that come to the dispensary
[03:15.960 --> 03:18.640]  always ask for old bubble hash.
[03:18.640 --> 03:22.480]  There's always been bubble hash around, but since the evolution, since legalization and
[03:22.480 --> 03:26.000]  medical cannabis concentrates and dabs have really evolved.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.520]  Now let me step in and correct myself.
[03:28.520 --> 03:32.600]  I need to talk about proper terminology here.
[03:32.600 --> 03:35.800]  Before we get too far, I keep saying dabs.
[03:35.800 --> 03:38.400]  A dab is actually a verb.
[03:38.400 --> 03:39.400]  Dabbing is a verb.
[03:39.400 --> 03:42.080]  A dab is kind of a unit of measurement.
[03:42.080 --> 03:47.040]  The phrase dab came from, I would get my dabber, the little tool in which I would scoop
[03:47.040 --> 03:52.880]  up my concentrate onto my dabber so I could put it onto my nail to consume it.
[03:52.880 --> 03:58.360]  The amount of concentrate that it would take to get me properly medicated was a dab.
[03:58.360 --> 04:03.240]  When the phrase dab came into this whole game, it was basically a unit of measurement.
[04:03.240 --> 04:06.400]  Now the term, the word has been used very broadly.
[04:06.400 --> 04:11.360]  It's like a Coke, any kind of a soda, a carbonated beverage in a can is now called a Coke.
[04:11.400 --> 04:15.240]  That's kind of how dab has been bastardized into the community, into the industry.
[04:15.240 --> 04:18.920]  It's okay, but I just want to clear up some things here so that we're all on the same page.
[04:18.920 --> 04:21.280]  We all know what I'm talking about.
[04:21.280 --> 04:22.280]  What is a dab?
[04:22.280 --> 04:27.400]  A dab is basically a unit of measurement or an amount of concentrate to be smoked.
[04:27.400 --> 04:29.080]  I want to take a dab.
[04:29.080 --> 04:30.400]  Hey, do you have any dabs?
[04:30.400 --> 04:32.240]  I haven't taken any dabs today.
[04:32.240 --> 04:33.240]  That's how we would say that.
[04:33.240 --> 04:34.720]  I could use a dab.
[04:34.720 --> 04:36.600]  I like to take dabs.
[04:36.600 --> 04:39.000]  That is kind of the way it should be said.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.600]  People say, can I buy any dab from you?
[04:41.600 --> 04:43.080]  That's not really the way that would go.
[04:43.080 --> 04:44.480]  Do you have any dab?
[04:44.480 --> 04:45.680]  That's not the way that would work.
[04:45.680 --> 04:47.240]  A dab is kind of a unit of measurement.
[04:47.240 --> 04:49.400]  Multiple doses would be some dabs.
[04:49.400 --> 04:51.160]  I think you get what I'm saying.
[04:51.160 --> 04:57.040]  What we should really be saying is dabs are concentrates or basically hash.
[04:57.040 --> 05:00.600]  A lot of the older audience will be more familiar with the word hash.
[05:00.600 --> 05:03.000]  That is hash is a cannabis concentrate.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.680]  We have taken the valuable, the useful, the medicinal part of that plant, and we have
[05:06.680 --> 05:08.680]  stripped it from the green leafy vegetable.
[05:08.680 --> 05:12.000]  The green part, the flower part, that is a carrier.
[05:12.000 --> 05:13.960]  That is what grew the trichomes.
[05:13.960 --> 05:16.320]  The trichomes is where the potency is hidden.
[05:16.320 --> 05:18.200]  The trichomes are where the potency is hidden.
[05:18.200 --> 05:19.680]  Maybe I should have said it that way.
[05:19.680 --> 05:20.960]  The trichomes are what we want.
[05:20.960 --> 05:24.960]  We have discovered methods and ways to remove those trichomes from the plant.
[05:24.960 --> 05:30.480]  And now we are concentrating those trichomes, that potency, that the terpenes, the other
[05:30.480 --> 05:32.760]  things are esters, palates, a lot of other things happening.
[05:32.760 --> 05:37.360]  But mainly we're going for the potency, the trichomes, the cannabinoids, and the terpenes
[05:37.360 --> 05:38.840]  is what we're mainly after in there.
[05:38.840 --> 05:43.040]  We are concentrating that into a smaller form and removing the leafy material that we do
[05:43.040 --> 05:44.320]  not need to consume.
[05:44.320 --> 05:48.200]  We're not horses, we're not rabbits, we don't need the green leafy matter like that.
[05:48.200 --> 05:52.780]  We want to smoke trichomes, resin glands, cannabinoids, terpenes.
[05:52.780 --> 05:53.780]  That is what we are after.
[05:53.780 --> 05:55.720]  So we've discovered how to remove that.
[05:55.720 --> 05:56.720]  There are many ways to do it.
[05:56.720 --> 06:01.880]  A lot of people do it through, you can do it through just, what is it, agitation.
[06:01.880 --> 06:05.560]  You can, now when the crystals, those crystals, the trichomes, when the crystals fall off
[06:05.560 --> 06:09.880]  the weed in your grinder, you are making dry sift hash basically.
[06:09.880 --> 06:10.960]  Not really, but kind of.
[06:10.960 --> 06:11.960]  That is trichomes.
[06:11.960 --> 06:12.960]  Those are trichomes.
[06:12.960 --> 06:13.960]  That is a concentrate.
[06:13.960 --> 06:15.380]  That is concentrated trichomes.
[06:15.380 --> 06:20.080]  If you press that into a puck or roll it into a ball or simply scoop it on top of your bowl,
[06:20.080 --> 06:24.160]  that'll get you extra buzz because that is a little concentrated trichome, a little concentrated
[06:24.160 --> 06:25.480]  THC on those trichomes.
[06:25.480 --> 06:27.120]  It's going to get you extra buzzed.
[06:27.120 --> 06:29.680]  There are also fancier ways of making dry sift hash.
[06:29.680 --> 06:31.520]  I've seen people use bags.
[06:31.520 --> 06:34.840]  We put a bunch of trim or a bunch of weed in a sieve bag with a certain size micron
[06:34.840 --> 06:37.040]  screen, beat the shit out of it for hours.
[06:37.040 --> 06:38.640]  All the trichomes fall off.
[06:38.640 --> 06:41.320]  The green leafy matter is left in the bag.
[06:41.320 --> 06:45.000]  Also another very popular method to do this is by using water.
[06:45.000 --> 06:46.460]  We've all been educated.
[06:46.460 --> 06:50.800]  We will be educated in the next episode on using ice and water to remove trichomes from
[06:50.800 --> 06:52.300]  the green leafy matter.
[06:52.300 --> 06:56.480]  In that case, water is not being used as a solvent, is being used as an agitator, as
[06:56.480 --> 06:59.460]  a mechanical separator, not as a solvent.
[06:59.460 --> 07:01.120]  So that's a different, when they say solventless.
[07:01.720 --> 07:03.360]  Yes, that is still solventless concentrate.
[07:03.360 --> 07:07.000]  A lot of people have discovered how to do it simply by squishing a bud.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.640]  You can squish a bud and you can make concentrates out of that.
[07:09.640 --> 07:13.680]  A lot of people will make bubble hash out of the bubble bags, take that and then squish
[07:13.680 --> 07:15.960]  that and that makes really nice rosin.
[07:15.960 --> 07:18.020]  We'll talk about that in the next episode.
[07:18.020 --> 07:21.800]  Then another very popular way, another thing that has evolved rapidly.
[07:21.800 --> 07:23.540]  Let me touch on CO2 oil.
[07:23.540 --> 07:30.320]  Also we can make concentrates with hexane, propane, CO2, all kinds of other gases.
[07:30.320 --> 07:34.080]  I don't know the technical term for what I'm trying to say here, but it's possible
[07:34.080 --> 07:36.760]  to make concentrates with many other gases.
[07:36.760 --> 07:40.760]  The one I am most familiar with, what I think is most commonly used is butane.
[07:40.760 --> 07:43.640]  I will not teach you how to make butane concentrates.
[07:43.640 --> 07:47.640]  We will not talk too much about that because it is dangerous and probably illegal where
[07:47.640 --> 07:48.640]  you are.
[07:48.640 --> 07:50.680]  I do not need to lead you down that rabbit hole.
[07:50.680 --> 07:55.200]  There are plenty of avenues for you to learn how to do that if that is your preferred method
[07:55.200 --> 07:56.200]  of making concentrates.
[07:56.200 --> 07:58.520]  So let's talk about, I'm way off on my notes.
[07:58.520 --> 08:01.480]  I don't know where I am, but we are going to talk about, I was talking about the actual
[08:01.480 --> 08:03.120]  terms here, wasn't I?
[08:03.120 --> 08:04.120]  Shit.
[08:04.120 --> 08:06.440]  The most popular is butane concentrates.
[08:06.440 --> 08:12.240]  Now in my opinion, the most popular here in Colorado is probably the butane extracted
[08:12.240 --> 08:13.240]  concentrates.
[08:13.240 --> 08:17.000]  If you get shatter, if you get batter, if you get diamonds, if you get sauce, most of
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.920]  the time those were extracted with butane.
[08:19.920 --> 08:24.400]  The other most popular is the fresh frozen, the live rosin.
[08:24.400 --> 08:25.480]  People really love that.
[08:25.480 --> 08:28.640]  The price differences in butane, hash, and rosin are astronomical.
[08:28.640 --> 08:31.080]  We'll talk about that in the next episode.
[08:31.080 --> 08:34.200]  I was trying to cover the terminology here.
[08:34.200 --> 08:40.520]  So a dab is a dose, a hit of a concentrate, of some hash.
[08:40.520 --> 08:45.120]  When we take those trichomes and we pull it off of the plant and we use either water,
[08:45.120 --> 08:51.360]  agitation, butane, heat, however we achieve that process, we have now made hash or a concentrate
[08:51.360 --> 08:52.680]  is basically what we've made.
[08:52.680 --> 08:57.440]  We've concentrated that potency into one smaller amount and now you need less of that
[08:57.440 --> 09:01.880]  to achieve the recreational or medical dose which you now desire.
[09:01.880 --> 09:06.640]  So that is basically a dab and what a dab is and what a concentrate is.
[09:06.640 --> 09:09.600]  Now the act of taking a dab is known as dabbing.
[09:09.600 --> 09:14.960]  If you called and I had a dab on the dabber and I was putting that on the nail into the
[09:14.960 --> 09:16.200]  rig, I know that's a lot of terms.
[09:16.200 --> 09:17.240]  We'll talk about that.
[09:17.240 --> 09:18.960]  If you called me right now and you said, what are you doing?
[09:18.960 --> 09:24.040]  I'd say, I am dabbing or if I had some people over and we're just sitting on the couch watching
[09:24.040 --> 09:27.640]  videos and taking dabs in a group and you called me or texted me and said, what are
[09:27.640 --> 09:28.640]  you guys doing?
[09:28.640 --> 09:29.640]  We are dabbing.
[09:29.640 --> 09:31.680]  So I think we've got the terminology down.
[09:31.680 --> 09:35.440]  Pedro will touch on that also in the next episode, but I wanted to make sure to cover
[09:35.440 --> 09:36.440]  that.
[09:36.440 --> 09:37.440]  So we know where we are.
[09:37.440 --> 09:38.440]  We're all on this podcast together.
[09:38.440 --> 09:43.580]  We're going to talk about concentrates, dabbing, dabs, and the evolution of such.
[09:43.580 --> 09:44.580]  So here we go.
[09:44.580 --> 09:46.320]  Let's talk more about that.
[09:46.360 --> 09:52.000]  I think I should start off kind of by talking about how I got into real concentrates, real
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.280]  BHO concentrates.
[09:54.280 --> 09:56.120]  My first dab, maybe.
[09:56.120 --> 10:00.400]  I'm going to talk about my first pre-dab and my first real dab, and then I'll talk about
[10:00.400 --> 10:02.560]  my first group dab.
[10:02.560 --> 10:04.600]  I got to change my notes because I just got an idea.
[10:04.600 --> 10:05.600]  Not even going to edit that.
[10:05.600 --> 10:06.640]  I will edit the change.
[10:06.640 --> 10:07.640]  Give me one second.
[10:07.640 --> 10:08.640]  All right.
[10:08.640 --> 10:09.640]  My notes have been annotated.
[10:09.640 --> 10:13.120]  I will not forget one of the stories I wanted to tell, one detail I wanted to put in this
[10:13.120 --> 10:16.560]  show, one more avenue of rambles I needed to add to the notes.
[10:16.560 --> 10:17.560]  Here we go.
[10:17.560 --> 10:20.760]  Let's talk about one of the first times I got real dabs.
[10:20.760 --> 10:24.260]  Of course, I was smoking concentrates with friends before then.
[10:24.260 --> 10:29.000]  We all would get random shit that we thought was hash or bubble hash or whatever people
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.480]  would sell us or give us when we were younger.
[10:31.480 --> 10:38.740]  Until this time period, I had never been stoned or high or DTFO.
[10:38.740 --> 10:40.760]  That stands for dabbed the fuck out.
[10:40.760 --> 10:44.960]  I have never been DTFO like I was on this occasion.
[10:44.960 --> 10:51.360]  Let's talk about my first experience acquiring some BHO, some butane honey oil, some butane
[10:51.360 --> 10:54.340]  extracted concentrate, and my experience.
[10:54.340 --> 10:58.360]  Right around the time that medical marijuana was becoming super popular in my area, this
[10:58.360 --> 11:02.360]  had to be 2007, 2008, maybe 2006.
[11:02.360 --> 11:03.480]  I've got a brain injury.
[11:03.480 --> 11:04.480]  Timelines are weird.
[11:04.480 --> 11:05.480]  I'm getting old.
[11:05.480 --> 11:06.480]  Shit's all blurry now.
[11:06.960 --> 11:11.900]  Around that time frame, I was doing business.
[11:11.900 --> 11:12.900]  This happened a long time ago.
[11:12.900 --> 11:14.200]  I was doing business with a friend.
[11:14.200 --> 11:17.600]  He had the most amazing sour diesel that money could buy.
[11:17.600 --> 11:18.600]  That shit was so good.
[11:18.600 --> 11:22.240]  You'd get in the car with it and everyone would be like, damn, and you'd light it up
[11:22.240 --> 11:23.840]  and your eyes would itch and shit.
[11:23.840 --> 11:26.440]  This dude, I was getting some sour diesel from him.
[11:26.440 --> 11:27.440]  This was like a weekly visit.
[11:27.440 --> 11:30.360]  I'd go get an ounce of sour D from this guy and try to make it last a week.
[11:30.360 --> 11:31.960]  It would never fucking work.
[11:31.960 --> 11:36.240]  One day I get some sour D from my buddy and he passes me just a little folded piece of
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  parchment paper.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.480]  It looked like a half a dollar sized piece of parchment paper folded in half.
[11:41.480 --> 11:46.240]  Inside of that parchment paper was some goopy golden stuff and he gave it to me and he goes,
[11:46.240 --> 11:48.680]  hit that when you get home and let me know what you think.
[11:48.680 --> 11:50.520]  So I got home and I had time to look at what I got.
[11:50.520 --> 11:54.600]  I unfolded it and I realized this is that BHO stuff I've been hearing about.
[11:54.600 --> 11:58.840]  This is that butane honey oil that I've been hearing about like in magazines and hearing
[11:58.840 --> 12:00.520]  other people in Denver and shit talk about it.
[12:00.520 --> 12:03.400]  I heard somebody talk about this recently and they said they got so high they couldn't
[12:03.400 --> 12:04.400]  handle themselves.
[12:04.400 --> 12:05.760]  I'm really curious about this.
[12:05.760 --> 12:07.800]  It was just a little teeny tiny bit.
[12:07.800 --> 12:09.200]  It wasn't very much.
[12:09.200 --> 12:12.760]  Now it would have been maybe a fat dab.
[12:12.760 --> 12:16.800]  Back then it was several dabs but now that would have been maybe one fat dab for me.
[12:16.800 --> 12:18.720]  I take pretty monstrous dabs.
[12:18.720 --> 12:22.040]  That wouldn't have been much now but back in the day that was a lot.
[12:22.040 --> 12:25.740]  So I took, I got a little scraper tool like a pipe cleaner tool, just something to scrape
[12:25.740 --> 12:29.680]  it up with and I gathered some of it off the parchment and I didn't have a proper way to
[12:29.680 --> 12:30.680]  smoke it.
[12:30.680 --> 12:32.640]  I didn't really have, I didn't have a dab tool.
[12:32.640 --> 12:35.760]  I didn't even know I was going to be dabbing so there was no dab equipment.
[12:35.760 --> 12:37.640]  So I got a little tiny pipe that was brand new.
[12:37.640 --> 12:39.040]  It was a gift from a dispensary.
[12:39.040 --> 12:40.400]  I spent some money at a dispensary.
[12:40.400 --> 12:41.400]  They were nice.
[12:41.400 --> 12:42.760]  They threw me a glass pipe as a gift.
[12:42.760 --> 12:46.480]  I put a little tiny chunk of weed in the bottom of the bowl just to cover the hole like a
[12:46.480 --> 12:47.480]  screen.
[12:47.480 --> 12:50.080]  If you ever get a new pipe that new hole is too fresh in there.
[12:50.080 --> 12:54.800]  I just took a chunk of weed, maybe one calyx, maybe it was one bract.
[12:54.800 --> 12:57.440]  I stuffed that in the hole to work as a screen.
[12:57.440 --> 13:01.720]  Then I took half of that little glob of, it wasn't even a glob, it was half of a big dab
[13:01.800 --> 13:05.480]  of the BHO concentrate and just smeared it on top of there.
[13:05.480 --> 13:08.080]  And then I sat at my desk and I was supposed to go somewhere.
[13:08.080 --> 13:09.920]  I had that new sour diesel in my pocket.
[13:09.920 --> 13:12.880]  I was going to go smoke with friends and go do some shit.
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.040]  But instead I took a lighter and I hit that BHO just a little bit.
[13:18.040 --> 13:22.200]  Just I just took one good hit to where I got like a nice lung full.
[13:22.200 --> 13:28.320]  And as soon as it hit my lungs, my brain went, Oh, Oh, Oh, we're going to get high, high.
[13:28.320 --> 13:31.000]  I thought we're getting high, we're going to get high, high.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.880]  As soon as my lungs went, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, and I blew it out and a cloud came out
[13:33.880 --> 13:35.440]  and I changed colors.
[13:35.440 --> 13:42.360]  And I went from my desk chair, zombie mode to my bed, face down, just and my body turned
[13:42.360 --> 13:43.360]  off.
[13:43.360 --> 13:44.840]  I remember having the most vivid dreams.
[13:44.840 --> 13:45.960]  I was super high.
[13:45.960 --> 13:50.160]  I woke up, my eyes were still bloody red and I was hungry as shit.
[13:50.160 --> 13:51.160]  I had to text my buddy.
[13:51.160 --> 13:54.600]  I was like, bro, was that BHO or did you give me drugs?
[13:54.600 --> 13:56.240]  And he's like, bro, that's BHO.
[13:56.240 --> 13:57.240]  And I made that.
[13:57.680 --> 14:01.400]  I was like, how much more do you have?
[14:01.400 --> 14:02.400]  Because I was so high.
[14:02.400 --> 14:03.560]  I had to share that with some friends.
[14:03.560 --> 14:05.480]  I had to share that experience.
[14:05.480 --> 14:08.480]  So for a little while there, we were smoking BHO on bowls.
[14:08.480 --> 14:09.840]  We're doing it all wrong.
[14:09.840 --> 14:10.840]  It was working.
[14:10.840 --> 14:14.400]  I got, I got high as shit, but we were not doing it right.
[14:14.400 --> 14:16.440]  We needed to find the proper equipment.
[14:16.440 --> 14:18.760]  So that leads me to my second dab.
[14:18.760 --> 14:20.680]  I'll tell you that after I adjust this camera.
[14:20.680 --> 14:21.680]  All right.
[14:21.680 --> 14:22.680]  The camera has been corrected.
[14:22.680 --> 14:25.320]  Hopefully through the magic of editing, you don't even notice.
[14:25.320 --> 14:26.920]  You only notice because I just told you.
[14:27.600 --> 14:29.000]  Let's talk about my second dab.
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.240]  I was at the Cannabis Cup.
[14:30.240 --> 14:32.520]  Again, I cannot recall which year this was.
[14:32.520 --> 14:37.360]  This was the first year of the Cannabis Cup in Denver, in Colorado at the, the little
[14:37.360 --> 14:38.360]  tiny place.
[14:38.360 --> 14:39.360]  What was it called?
[14:39.360 --> 14:40.360]  Exdo?
[14:40.360 --> 14:41.360]  Little tiny, tiny place.
[14:41.360 --> 14:42.360]  It was tiny.
[14:42.360 --> 14:43.360]  It was so crowded in there.
[14:43.360 --> 14:44.360]  Not the first time.
[14:44.360 --> 14:45.360]  It was pretty open the first time.
[14:45.360 --> 14:47.520]  Then several years later, it got super crowded.
[14:47.520 --> 14:49.400]  This time it was perfectly packed.
[14:49.400 --> 14:50.760]  We had to park down the block a little bit.
[14:50.760 --> 14:53.600]  It was pretty hyped up because it was a Cannabis Cup, a high times event.
[14:53.600 --> 14:56.080]  They're always huge.
[14:56.240 --> 14:57.240]  We walked around that event.
[14:57.240 --> 14:58.440]  We smoked weed with everybody.
[14:58.440 --> 15:01.360]  People are offering dabs.
[15:01.360 --> 15:02.360]  We saw it.
[15:02.360 --> 15:06.080]  I had a person with me and I was like, you want to go and hit a dab?
[15:06.080 --> 15:07.480]  She was like, sure, let's try that.
[15:07.480 --> 15:10.480]  We got in line for the booth at Broadway Wellness.
[15:10.480 --> 15:16.600]  Big shout out to my buddy, Big D, Daniel Desai, The Secret Cup, Top Shelf Extracts, Broadway
[15:16.600 --> 15:17.960]  Wellness.
[15:17.960 --> 15:20.960]  Big D was pivotal.
[15:20.960 --> 15:21.960]  That's a controversial statement.
[15:21.960 --> 15:22.960]  D, I love you.
[15:22.960 --> 15:24.160]  I got nothing but love and respect for you.
[15:24.160 --> 15:25.160]  D was pivotal.
[15:25.240 --> 15:26.240]  Pivotal, that's a good word.
[15:26.240 --> 15:27.240]  Say it a couple times.
[15:27.240 --> 15:29.280]  It becomes the new ROADS.
[15:29.280 --> 15:35.440]  D was a huge part in the evolution, the pioneering of concentrates in Colorado, especially the
[15:35.440 --> 15:37.080]  Denver area.
[15:37.080 --> 15:42.680]  He revolutionized, pioneered concentrate making, selling, dispensary operating, the way shit
[15:42.680 --> 15:43.680]  was done.
[15:43.680 --> 15:46.520]  He had a lot of influence on the industry, in my opinion.
[15:46.520 --> 15:48.080]  If you don't agree with that, that's fine.
[15:48.080 --> 15:49.080]  Send me an email.
[15:49.080 --> 15:50.080]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotMail.com.
[15:50.080 --> 15:55.080]  D's a controversial dude and I got nothing but love for the big guy.
[15:55.120 --> 15:57.160]  Keep taking care of yourself, brother.
[15:57.160 --> 16:01.000]  We're at this Cannabis Cup event and we're walking around and we decide that it's time
[16:01.000 --> 16:02.440]  to take a dab.
[16:02.440 --> 16:06.440]  We get in line for a dab at the Broadway Wellness booth.
[16:06.440 --> 16:09.120]  At that booth, a guy known as Big D was working there.
[16:09.120 --> 16:13.340]  I've seen him several times in magazines, on social media.
[16:13.340 --> 16:15.840]  Social media was banging for the weed scene at this time.
[16:15.840 --> 16:18.720]  This was before they took down all of the weed content.
[16:18.720 --> 16:21.320]  We used to do dab wars on social media.
[16:21.320 --> 16:27.480]  We would hashtag it dab wars, attack of the dabs and shit like that.
[16:27.480 --> 16:31.400]  A few of us were taking gigantic dabs and being silly on there.
[16:31.400 --> 16:33.520]  I digress and I kind of lost where I was.
[16:33.520 --> 16:34.600]  Where the fuck was I?
[16:34.600 --> 16:35.760]  Big D at Broadway Wellness.
[16:35.760 --> 16:36.920]  I knew we'd get back on track.
[16:36.920 --> 16:37.920]  We get in line, right?
[16:37.920 --> 16:41.440]  I know who Big D is and he's like, do you want a big dab or a little dab?
[16:41.440 --> 16:44.120]  I was like, no, I didn't even hit it first.
[16:44.120 --> 16:47.760]  The girl that was with me, she got in front and he's like, big dab or little dab?
[16:47.760 --> 16:49.060]  She's like, little dab.
[16:49.060 --> 16:51.040]  She takes a little tiny dab.
[16:51.040 --> 16:54.360]  He heats up what is known as a swing arm skillet at this time.
[16:54.360 --> 17:00.160]  He's got a little piece of titanium that swings up and you heat that and then it swings down
[17:00.160 --> 17:04.960]  and it attaches to a piece of glass that looks like it goes into the bong and comes out like
[17:04.960 --> 17:09.980]  a bong stem would, but then it comes down, it curves downward and has a bell that would
[17:09.980 --> 17:11.360]  flare out.
[17:11.360 --> 17:15.720]  It's shaped like an umbrella or a bell and a swing arm swings underneath the opening
[17:15.720 --> 17:19.640]  of the bell to absorb the smoke so that you could inhale through the smoke, the smoke
[17:19.800 --> 17:22.320]  through the bong, which this piece is attached to.
[17:22.320 --> 17:23.320]  That makes sense.
[17:23.320 --> 17:27.480]  He had a little, like a 10 inch tiny bong with not a big thick stem on it.
[17:27.480 --> 17:29.080]  So you didn't get too much smoke in there at once.
[17:29.080 --> 17:30.720]  It just went straight to your head.
[17:30.720 --> 17:32.920]  So he heats it up.
[17:32.920 --> 17:33.920]  Way too hot back in the day.
[17:33.920 --> 17:34.920]  We didn't know yet.
[17:34.920 --> 17:36.880]  Heated it up way too hot.
[17:36.880 --> 17:37.940]  Put the dab on there.
[17:37.940 --> 17:41.920]  The girl that was with me hit it and she went wobbly numb for a couple of seconds.
[17:41.920 --> 17:45.280]  I had to reach underneath her arms and support her, kind of reach underneath her and hold
[17:45.280 --> 17:47.560]  her up for a minute because she went wobbly.
[17:47.560 --> 17:49.680]  She went kind of frog leg, kind of fishing a little bit.
[17:49.680 --> 17:50.720]  She blew out this cloud.
[17:50.720 --> 17:51.720]  She looked back at me.
[17:51.720 --> 17:53.240]  She goes, I need to go sit down.
[17:53.240 --> 17:55.120]  And I was like, well, let me, let me get.
[17:55.120 --> 17:58.320]  She's like, yeah, yeah, you get one of those, but I'm going over there.
[17:58.320 --> 17:59.760]  So she kind of bust out of the crowd.
[17:59.760 --> 18:02.960]  She had to go sit down and get her shit together, take a drink, catch her breath.
[18:02.960 --> 18:05.400]  And I'm like, wow, this looks like a good fucking time.
[18:05.400 --> 18:06.400]  So I line up, it's my turn.
[18:06.400 --> 18:08.040]  I got the rig right in front of me.
[18:08.040 --> 18:10.440]  Big D drops a fat dab on there because I'm a white guy with dreads.
[18:10.440 --> 18:11.960]  I look like I know what I'm doing.
[18:11.960 --> 18:15.040]  And I got skyrocket high from that dab.
[18:15.040 --> 18:20.320]  When I blew out that smoke, my brain, it felt like fireworks went out one side, a rocket
[18:20.320 --> 18:21.400]  ship flew out the other.
[18:21.400 --> 18:24.360]  But then it also felt like I shit my pants at the same time.
[18:24.360 --> 18:25.560]  A lot of things were happening.
[18:25.560 --> 18:27.720]  I was in, it was heaven and hell at the same time.
[18:27.720 --> 18:31.720]  Cause I was so high that I was like, am I, am I having a stroke?
[18:31.720 --> 18:32.720]  Am I coming?
[18:32.720 --> 18:33.720]  Am I dying?
[18:33.720 --> 18:34.720]  Is this living?
[18:34.720 --> 18:37.680]  Like I wasn't sure what the fuck was really happening from that dab.
[18:37.680 --> 18:42.080]  But I know that I loved it because before we left that event, I went back and bought
[18:42.360 --> 18:45.000]  one of the exact rigs that I hit.
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.600]  And I bought one of the exact torches he used to heat that bitch up.
[18:48.600 --> 18:52.000]  And I bought a bunch of concentrates from everywhere I could find at that event.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.480]  So from then we started dabbing heavy.
[18:55.480 --> 18:58.080]  Now that will lead me into another great story.
[18:58.080 --> 18:59.460]  Part of my evolution of dabbing.
[18:59.460 --> 19:00.460]  This is how it all began.
[19:00.460 --> 19:02.800]  You guys, this is one of my favorite stories to tell.
[19:02.800 --> 19:05.680]  This may be a short podcast actually, cause this camera is telling me that the battery's
[19:05.680 --> 19:09.020]  low and it was at a hundred percent when I started 22 minutes ago.
[19:09.020 --> 19:11.120]  You guys don't care about the tech issues.
[19:11.160 --> 19:14.440]  Road dab story on the 709 episode.
[19:14.440 --> 19:15.440]  Here we go.
[19:15.440 --> 19:16.440]  Rasta Jeff telling stories today.
[19:16.440 --> 19:17.440]  Gather around you guys.
[19:17.440 --> 19:18.440]  It's story time with Rasta Jeff.
[19:18.440 --> 19:19.440]  All right.
[19:19.440 --> 19:20.440]  Who was in this story?
[19:20.440 --> 19:22.640]  This story starts off with Pops.
[19:22.640 --> 19:23.920]  Big shout out to our friend Pops.
[19:23.920 --> 19:24.920]  Rest in peace, brother.
[19:24.920 --> 19:25.920]  Miss you.
[19:25.920 --> 19:26.920]  Love you.
[19:26.920 --> 19:28.680]  Also, Kevin was there.
[19:28.680 --> 19:29.680]  Big up to Kevin.
[19:29.680 --> 19:30.680]  I haven't seen Kevin in a minute.
[19:30.680 --> 19:31.680]  Hope you were well, brother.
[19:31.680 --> 19:32.680]  Mike may have been there.
[19:32.680 --> 19:33.680]  I'm pretty sure Mike was there.
[19:33.680 --> 19:34.680]  I'm not sure.
[19:34.680 --> 19:35.680]  Wade may have been there.
[19:35.680 --> 19:38.960]  There were probably six or seven people in my basement.
[19:38.960 --> 19:40.240]  I called a bunch of people over.
[19:40.360 --> 19:42.560]  I was like, hey guys, I got a new rig.
[19:42.560 --> 19:43.560]  I got a torch.
[19:43.560 --> 19:44.720]  I've got some dabs.
[19:44.720 --> 19:50.000]  I want to show off and I want to get everybody skyrocket high like I did at this event.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.520]  So the whole crew came over.
[19:51.520 --> 19:54.360]  I think my girlfriend at the time might have been there also.
[19:54.360 --> 19:56.400]  And I got a bunch of concentrates on the table.
[19:56.400 --> 19:57.880]  I lined up dabs for everybody.
[19:57.880 --> 19:59.400]  We all took a dab.
[19:59.400 --> 20:04.440]  We all leaned back in our chair for about 10 minutes.
[20:04.440 --> 20:07.760]  Everybody kind of one at a time decided I got to go home.
[20:07.760 --> 20:09.080]  Our friend Tony was there also.
[20:09.080 --> 20:10.080]  Big up to Tony.
[20:10.920 --> 20:12.720]  Everybody decided, man, I got to go.
[20:12.720 --> 20:13.720]  And they all just got up.
[20:13.720 --> 20:14.720]  They just left quietly.
[20:14.720 --> 20:15.920]  People are like, I got to go take a nap.
[20:15.920 --> 20:17.520]  I got to go get food.
[20:17.520 --> 20:19.160]  People just disappeared off the couches.
[20:19.160 --> 20:20.840]  I honestly laid the fuck down.
[20:20.840 --> 20:22.960]  It took about a six hour nap.
[20:22.960 --> 20:26.040]  When I woke up, everybody started texting about the same time.
[20:26.040 --> 20:27.280]  Like bro, did you fall asleep?
[20:27.280 --> 20:29.160]  Bro, did you eat all of the food?
[20:29.160 --> 20:30.160]  Like I woke up.
[20:30.160 --> 20:31.640]  So we wrecked everybody that day.
[20:31.640 --> 20:34.640]  And that was the first time we got the whole group over here.
[20:34.640 --> 20:35.760]  Super super baked.
[20:35.760 --> 20:38.320]  The whole IRI crew, the original IRI Genetics,
[20:38.320 --> 20:40.680]  IRI Army crew got lit.
[20:40.680 --> 20:41.720]  So big up to that day.
[20:41.720 --> 20:43.000]  I'll never forget that day.
[20:43.000 --> 20:44.000]  Pops, I'll miss you forever.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.840]  You're always going to be in that story.
[20:46.840 --> 20:50.360]  But that was when I killed the entire crew.
[20:50.360 --> 20:52.400]  All right, so that gets us into my first,
[20:52.400 --> 20:53.800]  second, third dab story.
[20:53.800 --> 20:55.520]  Three good stories is enough for this one.
[20:55.520 --> 20:56.880]  Let's talk a little bit more
[20:56.880 --> 20:59.920]  about the actual evolution of dabbing.
[20:59.920 --> 21:03.280]  When we started this, the BHO Concentrates,
[21:03.320 --> 21:07.560]  we were open blasting in enclosed places with PVC tubes.
[21:07.560 --> 21:10.440]  If you're a concentrate maker or a concentrate consumer,
[21:10.440 --> 21:13.000]  all of those things are completely absurd.
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.240]  You should not be open blasting,
[21:15.240 --> 21:17.280]  which is if you don't know what that is, that's fine.
[21:17.280 --> 21:20.600]  If you do, you're going, oh man, I remember those days.
[21:20.600 --> 21:22.480]  That's just blasting cans of butane
[21:22.480 --> 21:27.080]  haphazardly through a PVC tube stuffed with concentrates
[21:27.080 --> 21:29.320]  to make, or stuffed with weed to make concentrates out of it.
[21:29.320 --> 21:30.840]  Don't do that.
[21:30.840 --> 21:32.040]  Don't do that.
[21:32.040 --> 21:33.200]  That is terrible.
[21:34.000 --> 21:35.800]  The PVC leeches, you get gases and shit
[21:35.800 --> 21:37.720]  from the PVC in your concentrate.
[21:37.720 --> 21:38.960]  You shouldn't be open blasting.
[21:38.960 --> 21:41.320]  And I said in enclosed spaces.
[21:41.320 --> 21:42.960]  That's how shit blows up.
[21:42.960 --> 21:45.920]  I know several people that are scarred from head to toe,
[21:45.920 --> 21:47.120]  don't have any hair on their body,
[21:47.120 --> 21:48.760]  don't have any eyebrows and eyelashes
[21:48.760 --> 21:52.600]  because they were making butane concentrates incorrectly.
[21:52.600 --> 21:53.960]  So we've gone a long way.
[21:53.960 --> 21:55.980]  We went from doing that in the backyard
[21:55.980 --> 21:57.260]  with shitty equipment
[21:57.260 --> 22:00.800]  into having professional, amazing labs.
[22:00.800 --> 22:02.760]  But let's not overlook a bunch of the steps
[22:03.280 --> 22:04.120]  that it took to get there.
[22:04.120 --> 22:06.640]  We went from, like I said, open blasting inside.
[22:06.640 --> 22:08.160]  We finally went outdoors.
[22:08.160 --> 22:09.600]  We learned how to get better equipment,
[22:09.600 --> 22:12.000]  safer, more sterile equipment.
[22:12.000 --> 22:13.600]  People started learning about science
[22:13.600 --> 22:16.680]  and reading science and chemistry papers.
[22:16.680 --> 22:18.080]  We started getting vac ovens.
[22:18.080 --> 22:19.800]  When we started getting vacuum ovens
[22:19.800 --> 22:23.040]  and learning how to properly purge the BHO concentrates,
[22:23.040 --> 22:24.660]  the game changed forever.
[22:24.660 --> 22:27.380]  People can make better concentrates more quickly.
[22:27.380 --> 22:29.160]  Batches could be larger.
[22:29.160 --> 22:30.300]  Production stepped up.
[22:30.300 --> 22:32.520]  Quality stepped up quite a bit.
[22:33.280 --> 22:34.120]  Then it became an art.
[22:34.120 --> 22:36.560]  The term extract artist became super popular.
[22:36.560 --> 22:39.640]  Everybody in Colorado, everybody in California,
[22:39.640 --> 22:42.400]  you were either a grower, a breeder, or an extract artist.
[22:42.400 --> 22:44.620]  Some people were all of the fucking above.
[22:45.880 --> 22:48.200]  Making extracts and concentrates was huge
[22:48.200 --> 22:49.040]  for a little while there
[22:49.040 --> 22:51.800]  when those vacuum ovens became popular.
[22:51.800 --> 22:54.920]  Then, does anybody remember mystery oils?
[22:54.920 --> 22:56.400]  I've got mystery oils written down.
[22:56.400 --> 22:57.400]  I have to go fast here
[22:57.400 --> 23:00.200]  because that camera is losing battery rapidly.
[23:00.200 --> 23:01.280]  We need to get another camera
[23:01.280 --> 23:03.480]  and figure out some shit here.
[23:03.480 --> 23:04.800]  Remember mystery oil, you guys?
[23:04.800 --> 23:06.360]  If you're around for mystery oil,
[23:06.360 --> 23:07.200]  we started making butane.
[23:07.200 --> 23:09.360]  When we started purging properly,
[23:09.360 --> 23:11.960]  we started discovering a weird layer of oils
[23:11.960 --> 23:13.140]  on top of our concentrates.
[23:13.140 --> 23:16.140]  We didn't know if it was coming from the plants itself,
[23:16.140 --> 23:18.160]  pesticides or something applied to the plant,
[23:18.160 --> 23:20.320]  or the big question was,
[23:20.320 --> 23:22.960]  is it coming from the butane cans which we were buying?
[23:22.960 --> 23:25.040]  Then later we discovered, guess what?
[23:25.040 --> 23:27.480]  It was coming from the cans of butane which we were buying.
[23:27.480 --> 23:28.360]  Nobody knew what it was.
[23:28.360 --> 23:30.060]  It was never identified.
[23:30.060 --> 23:31.200]  People were curious about it.
[23:31.920 --> 23:33.200]  A lot of us probably smoked a lot of that shit,
[23:33.200 --> 23:34.800]  didn't know it, didn't realize it.
[23:34.800 --> 23:36.160]  Still have no idea what it was.
[23:36.160 --> 23:38.480]  Maybe that's why I twitch when I wake up in the mornings.
[23:38.480 --> 23:40.200]  You never know.
[23:40.200 --> 23:41.080]  So we got much better.
[23:41.080 --> 23:41.920]  We learned to purge.
[23:41.920 --> 23:43.600]  We got vac ovens.
[23:43.600 --> 23:45.040]  We discovered mystery oils.
[23:45.040 --> 23:46.440]  Mystery oil was a good time.
[23:46.440 --> 23:49.380]  Our concentrates went from black poop soup.
[23:49.380 --> 23:53.040]  I used to call things poop soup and tain soup, butane soup.
[23:53.040 --> 23:55.000]  You'd get dabs, you'd get concentrate,
[23:55.000 --> 23:55.920]  you'd take a dab of it
[23:55.920 --> 23:58.000]  and you'd put it on somebody's nail or your nail
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.640]  and it would sparkle and it would make a stain.
[24:00.640 --> 24:03.480]  Now concentrates, they burn smooth and they vaporize
[24:03.480 --> 24:05.000]  and they disappear cleanly.
[24:05.000 --> 24:06.640]  Here's a quick trick.
[24:06.640 --> 24:08.440]  Random side notes from Ross to Jeff.
[24:08.440 --> 24:11.440]  If anybody ever offers you a dab, a puff of a concentrate
[24:11.440 --> 24:13.640]  or even some flowers that you don't want to smoke,
[24:13.640 --> 24:15.720]  my way of diverting that conversation
[24:15.720 --> 24:17.920]  and politely avoiding that is I go,
[24:17.920 --> 24:19.040]  oh man, that looks pretty good.
[24:19.040 --> 24:20.480]  You want to try some of what I got?
[24:20.480 --> 24:22.080]  And then I bust out mine
[24:22.080 --> 24:24.000]  and it always diverts the conversation.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.040]  You don't have to smoke their dabs or their flowers
[24:26.040 --> 24:27.340]  if it looks questionable.
[24:27.340 --> 24:28.180]  I understand.
[24:28.180 --> 24:31.180]  Sometimes I don't want to smoke certain concentrates
[24:31.180 --> 24:33.100]  that I see that certain people bring around.
[24:33.100 --> 24:35.460]  No offense to anybody, but some of your concentrate
[24:35.460 --> 24:37.460]  looks like complete shit and I'm not going to smoke it.
[24:37.460 --> 24:41.740]  I'm not going to put my lungs, my health, my body at risk.
[24:41.740 --> 24:44.180]  Also, ew, I just don't want to smoke it.
[24:44.180 --> 24:47.620]  So you can avoid smoking other people's nasty poop soup,
[24:47.620 --> 24:50.860]  their tain crap, their butane batter,
[24:50.860 --> 24:52.460]  just by saying, oh, check this out, bro,
[24:52.460 --> 24:53.300]  and show it to them.
[24:53.300 --> 24:54.140]  And you both take a dab of that
[24:54.140 --> 24:55.220]  and then you still have a friend.
[24:55.220 --> 24:57.020]  And then if they're really insistent, you can be like,
[24:57.020 --> 24:58.820]  oh man, I'm high after the dab I took.
[24:58.820 --> 25:00.760]  And you can just keep making excuses all day,
[25:00.760 --> 25:02.640]  but you can politely tactfully dodge it.
[25:02.640 --> 25:04.220]  Got a couple of excuses for you.
[25:04.220 --> 25:06.340]  Let me get my high rambly ass back on track now.
[25:06.340 --> 25:09.340]  We went from poop soup to the stuff that we have now.
[25:09.340 --> 25:12.240]  You guys, we had stuff would come out,
[25:12.240 --> 25:14.060]  liquidy and goopy and the wrong color.
[25:14.060 --> 25:15.380]  And then it started to shatter.
[25:15.380 --> 25:16.860]  We had concentrates called shatter.
[25:16.860 --> 25:19.640]  They used to say, if it don't shatter, it don't matter.
[25:19.640 --> 25:22.420]  And then we realized a lot of the shatter was lipids
[25:22.420 --> 25:24.340]  and things that we don't really want to smoke.
[25:24.340 --> 25:26.020]  And then we started learning that you could whip it
[25:26.020 --> 25:27.540]  and turn it into a batter.
[25:27.540 --> 25:30.940]  I really like a nice batter, especially a live batter.
[25:30.940 --> 25:33.340]  That's when you fresh freeze it, then extract it,
[25:33.340 --> 25:34.740]  then make a batter out of it.
[25:34.740 --> 25:35.580]  But I like a batter.
[25:35.580 --> 25:38.580]  I feel like it's very terpy, has a lot of terpenes,
[25:38.580 --> 25:39.860]  a lot of flavor.
[25:39.860 --> 25:43.460]  And I really think that the feeling in the lungs is great.
[25:43.460 --> 25:48.020]  So we had goop and then we had shatter, then we had batter.
[25:48.020 --> 25:48.860]  Then we had wax.
[25:48.860 --> 25:51.000]  People learned how to make it into a waxy texture.
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.420]  Sometimes I really liked the wax.
[25:52.420 --> 25:55.140]  You'd get a big old glob of wax and heat up the dab nail
[25:55.140 --> 25:57.180]  and just press the wax right into the dab nail
[25:57.180 --> 25:59.220]  and smoke as much as you want, all in one big rip.
[25:59.220 --> 26:00.540]  That was pretty fun to do.
[26:01.540 --> 26:03.380]  We had crumble, stuff that would just fall apart
[26:03.380 --> 26:04.220]  and crumble.
[26:04.220 --> 26:06.020]  There are so many different textures of concentrates
[26:06.020 --> 26:07.660]  and so many different names.
[26:07.660 --> 26:10.260]  I got, regionally, it got known as a lot of different shit.
[26:10.260 --> 26:13.060]  Also, you could go from Pueblo to Denver, up to Boulder,
[26:13.060 --> 26:14.780]  and the same shit would be called something different.
[26:14.780 --> 26:16.500]  You'd find earwax in different places.
[26:16.500 --> 26:18.980]  It'd be called crumble in a different place.
[26:18.980 --> 26:20.620]  You can tell why it's called earwax.
[26:20.620 --> 26:23.060]  Pull out a chunk of goopy earwax and look at it.
[26:23.060 --> 26:24.840]  There was a concentrate that looked like that.
[26:25.560 --> 26:26.920]  Whatever color that shit is that came out of your ear,
[26:26.920 --> 26:29.800]  there was a concentrate that looked like that somewhere.
[26:29.800 --> 26:33.760]  So now, we've gotten better and cleaner concentrates.
[26:33.760 --> 26:36.000]  Now we've got diamonds and sauce
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.160]  and live rosins and live batter.
[26:38.160 --> 26:41.080]  Now we can basically, I'm not a Scientologist.
[26:41.080 --> 26:42.360]  I'm not a concentrate maker.
[26:42.360 --> 26:44.920]  I'm not an extraction nearest in any way,
[26:44.920 --> 26:47.720]  but now I understand that we can basically extract
[26:47.720 --> 26:51.200]  and divide any of the components of the plant,
[26:51.200 --> 26:52.760]  which we so desire.
[26:52.760 --> 26:55.360]  We can pull out the terpenes in one container.
[26:55.360 --> 26:57.800]  We can pull out the cannabinoids in another container.
[26:57.800 --> 26:59.980]  We can pull out the pesticides in another container
[26:59.980 --> 27:03.160]  and isolate all of those components of the cannabis plant
[27:03.160 --> 27:04.760]  is where this evolution has gotten.
[27:04.760 --> 27:09.640]  Now we are making big diamonds out of straight THCA.
[27:09.640 --> 27:12.080]  It's 99.9% THCA,
[27:12.080 --> 27:14.480]  and that 1% is just atmospheric allowances.
[27:14.480 --> 27:16.120]  There's gotta be oxygen and some moisture
[27:16.120 --> 27:17.480]  and shit in there.
[27:17.480 --> 27:18.800]  Now we can also make the same thing
[27:18.800 --> 27:20.560]  with CBD crystals and isolates.
[27:20.560 --> 27:22.080]  It's amazing to me.
[27:22.400 --> 27:25.640]  You can buy 99% cannabis derived terpenes
[27:25.640 --> 27:27.040]  and you can mix your own crystals
[27:27.040 --> 27:28.560]  and your own terpenes together
[27:28.560 --> 27:31.520]  and make your own ratios to the amount that you like.
[27:31.520 --> 27:33.420]  I don't, I used to really love the diamonds,
[27:33.420 --> 27:36.040]  but I feel like they're, I like the buzz,
[27:36.040 --> 27:37.560]  but I feel like when I smoke those diamonds
[27:37.560 --> 27:38.440]  without enough terps,
[27:38.440 --> 27:41.040]  the THC just makes me go real high for a minute
[27:41.040 --> 27:42.960]  and there's no fun to the buzz.
[27:42.960 --> 27:45.760]  It's like, I'm really high, but no, I'm not.
[27:45.760 --> 27:46.600]  It's just weird.
[27:46.600 --> 27:49.040]  I feel like the terps really give a color to the buzz.
[27:49.040 --> 27:51.040]  If my buzz was a firework,
[27:51.040 --> 27:52.900]  the THC makes me fly up in the air
[27:52.900 --> 27:55.440]  and then the terpenes are the color of my buzz.
[27:55.440 --> 27:57.680]  And those crystals don't have any color to them
[27:57.680 --> 27:58.520]  in the buzz, bro.
[27:58.520 --> 28:00.680]  They get you real high, make your chest feel weird,
[28:00.680 --> 28:01.520]  get your heart racing,
[28:01.520 --> 28:03.000]  make your blood sugar do weird shit,
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.040]  but I'm not a big fan of the high
[28:05.040 --> 28:07.200]  without some sort of backup into there.
[28:08.560 --> 28:11.360]  I feel like, I feel like this is my prediction.
[28:11.360 --> 28:13.120]  I don't know if I've ever said this on a podcast.
[28:13.120 --> 28:16.120]  I know I've said this in previous Instagram live videos
[28:16.120 --> 28:18.240]  and other weird rambles where I have appeared,
[28:18.240 --> 28:21.920]  but here is a prediction that I do see coming in the future
[28:21.920 --> 28:24.000]  if it doesn't already exist and they're,
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.340]  Babylon is just keeping it from us.
[28:25.340 --> 28:26.240]  It's a big conspiracy,
[28:26.240 --> 28:28.360]  but really this is what I do see coming.
[28:28.360 --> 28:32.940]  In the future, ideally, I think that each patient, consumer,
[28:32.940 --> 28:34.880]  either recreational or medically,
[28:34.880 --> 28:38.200]  will be able to walk into maybe a dispensary.
[28:38.200 --> 28:40.280]  It might just be your normal store.
[28:40.280 --> 28:41.120]  Who knows?
[28:41.120 --> 28:43.000]  You may be able to do this at Starbucks,
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.400]  but I would like to be able to walk into a place
[28:46.360 --> 28:48.200]  and I can hand them my card
[28:49.040 --> 28:51.240]  and my card has my preferred mix.
[28:51.240 --> 28:52.080]  Now hear me out.
[28:52.080 --> 28:53.620]  This sounds crazy, but when we get there together,
[28:53.620 --> 28:55.520]  you're gonna go, I want this card.
[28:55.520 --> 28:57.540]  Imagine when you go, when we were a kid
[28:57.540 --> 29:01.760]  and we would go to Roundtable Pizza is where I went, bro.
[29:01.760 --> 29:03.160]  I just had a crazy flashback.
[29:03.160 --> 29:05.120]  Did you see it happen in my face?
[29:05.120 --> 29:07.400]  Roundtable Pizza was the pizza place near me
[29:07.400 --> 29:10.120]  and they had all of the soda machines in a row.
[29:10.120 --> 29:12.520]  You could get Coke, Diet Coke, Cherry Coke,
[29:13.400 --> 29:18.180]  fucking Vanilla Coke, Pepsi, tea, SunKiss.
[29:18.180 --> 29:19.460]  What's the fucking other one?
[29:19.460 --> 29:22.060]  Maybe some Fanta, some Dr. Pepper,
[29:22.060 --> 29:24.500]  maybe even some lemonade.
[29:24.500 --> 29:26.460]  Who knows what the fuck else they had on that row
[29:26.460 --> 29:28.540]  of fucking sugary, diabetes drinks,
[29:28.540 --> 29:32.460]  but you could go make your, we call it a suicide, right?
[29:32.460 --> 29:34.980]  You could put, if you put Sprite in the suicide,
[29:34.980 --> 29:35.800]  you're fucking it all up.
[29:35.800 --> 29:36.640]  Why would you do that?
[29:36.640 --> 29:37.900]  You wanna put all the darkest colors,
[29:37.900 --> 29:39.620]  the cherry, the Dr. Pepper.
[29:39.620 --> 29:41.420]  I'd make the most disgusting concoctions
[29:41.420 --> 29:43.660]  of sugar and syrup you could out of that thing.
[29:43.660 --> 29:46.500]  What if you could walk into a dispensary,
[29:46.500 --> 29:49.380]  a Terp Bucks, a Dab Bucks,
[29:49.380 --> 29:51.100]  whatever you wanna call this place,
[29:51.100 --> 29:52.420]  and you could hand them your card.
[29:52.420 --> 29:55.740]  And that card said, my preferred slurry is this.
[29:55.740 --> 29:56.580]  And you drop that card.
[29:56.580 --> 29:57.400]  Maybe you just swipe it in.
[29:57.400 --> 29:58.440]  There's no people.
[29:58.440 --> 30:00.620]  You put it into a machine and the machine says,
[30:00.620 --> 30:02.260]  oh, Rasta Jeff is here.
[30:02.260 --> 30:04.840]  He wants to concentrate that is this.
[30:04.840 --> 30:09.840]  Let's say 50% THCA because I like to get real high.
[30:09.860 --> 30:12.660]  Then let's put, and I'm just making up numbers.
[30:12.660 --> 30:13.980]  I don't know the numbers here.
[30:13.980 --> 30:15.940]  This is, I'm creating this as we go.
[30:15.940 --> 30:17.180]  This is my dream.
[30:17.180 --> 30:18.720]  Come live it with me.
[30:18.720 --> 30:22.620]  My card says that I want 50% THCA in my slurry,
[30:22.620 --> 30:24.900]  zero CBD, because I don't fuck with CBD.
[30:24.900 --> 30:26.380]  That ruins my buzz.
[30:26.380 --> 30:27.580]  I want some limonene.
[30:27.580 --> 30:29.000]  I want some linalool.
[30:29.000 --> 30:30.860]  I want a little bit of pinene in there
[30:30.860 --> 30:33.260]  and let's put some mercine in there just to kick it off.
[30:33.260 --> 30:35.140]  And then I don't know what other cannabinoids,
[30:35.140 --> 30:37.520]  paleo, it's in esters we could add to that yet.
[30:37.520 --> 30:38.940]  But in the future, science will know
[30:38.940 --> 30:40.500]  what things we can add to that.
[30:40.500 --> 30:42.580]  Maybe we're just gonna put some carofeline
[30:43.420 --> 30:44.260]  in there.
[30:44.260 --> 30:45.460]  Maybe we'll just add weird components of other shit
[30:45.460 --> 30:47.340]  in there that are organic compounds.
[30:47.340 --> 30:49.980]  It will help that buzz affect me the way that I need to
[30:49.980 --> 30:53.900]  for my medical or recreational desire.
[30:53.900 --> 30:57.580]  Maybe I've got two or three recipes on a card
[30:57.580 --> 30:59.340]  that I can just swipe this card.
[30:59.340 --> 31:01.500]  Maybe I can set my settings on my phone and say,
[31:01.500 --> 31:04.720]  I want to get high as fuck to where when I smoke
[31:04.720 --> 31:07.040]  this concentrate, fireworks go off in my brain
[31:07.040 --> 31:08.140]  and I can levitate.
[31:08.140 --> 31:09.860]  And then maybe I've got another one that I can go
[31:09.860 --> 31:11.900]  to my phone and say, I need to take a fucking nap.
[31:11.940 --> 31:13.940]  Knock me out, put me down.
[31:13.940 --> 31:15.380]  I can make two different concentrates,
[31:15.380 --> 31:17.420]  swipe my card, it spits both of them out,
[31:17.420 --> 31:18.380]  puts a label on them.
[31:18.380 --> 31:20.940]  This one is 50% THC, a bunch of limonene,
[31:20.940 --> 31:22.940]  some linalool, you're gonna get high as fuck.
[31:22.940 --> 31:25.060]  This one over here is all sleepy time components.
[31:25.060 --> 31:26.520]  I don't know what that would be for my body,
[31:26.520 --> 31:27.820]  but that's in this one.
[31:27.820 --> 31:30.220]  It spits them out, charges my card, sends me home.
[31:30.220 --> 31:32.900]  I get to go take dabs of Rosted Jeff's
[31:32.900 --> 31:35.380]  custom slurry concentrate.
[31:35.380 --> 31:37.860]  Just imagine walking around with your own vape pen
[31:37.860 --> 31:40.340]  with your custom slurry or your own dab rig
[31:40.340 --> 31:42.100]  and hitting your own custom slurry
[31:42.100 --> 31:44.060]  and then your friends got their own.
[31:44.060 --> 31:46.420]  It's like mixing jelly bellies and finding your flavors
[31:46.420 --> 31:48.180]  or mixing up fucking sodas all day.
[31:48.180 --> 31:49.780]  I really think that's the way of the future.
[31:49.780 --> 31:51.540]  That's what I wanna see in cannabis,
[31:51.540 --> 31:54.500]  in concentrate development improvement.
[31:54.500 --> 31:57.420]  Because right now I love the textures,
[31:57.420 --> 32:00.140]  the batters, the butters, the sauces, all of that.
[32:00.140 --> 32:01.480]  I love it.
[32:01.480 --> 32:03.700]  The terpenes cannot be beat.
[32:03.700 --> 32:07.900]  Cannabis concentrates, the flavors are at an all time peak.
[32:08.060 --> 32:09.820]  I've got some GMO concentrates
[32:09.820 --> 32:11.420]  and some garlic banger concentrates
[32:11.420 --> 32:14.660]  that when you open the jar, it is almost disgusting.
[32:14.660 --> 32:15.740]  It's almost vile.
[32:15.740 --> 32:17.300]  It almost makes you go, ugh.
[32:17.300 --> 32:19.460]  And then you take a dab of it and you blow it out
[32:19.460 --> 32:21.740]  and your mouth has this like burnt rubber,
[32:21.740 --> 32:24.540]  rotten eggs, gas and skunk thing on it.
[32:24.540 --> 32:27.940]  And you go, that's disgustingly delicious.
[32:27.940 --> 32:29.660]  Can I have another dab of that?
[32:29.660 --> 32:31.180]  Terpenes have never been stronger.
[32:31.180 --> 32:33.420]  We're learning how to preserve the terps and the grow
[32:33.420 --> 32:35.620]  and the dry and cure or the harvest process,
[32:35.620 --> 32:37.060]  even if there's no dry and cure.
[32:37.100 --> 32:39.620]  And then also in the concentrate production
[32:39.620 --> 32:42.060]  and then in the preservation of those concentrates,
[32:42.060 --> 32:45.580]  the transport, those jars have to get from one facility
[32:45.580 --> 32:46.900]  to another and stay fresh.
[32:46.900 --> 32:48.860]  And then you have to buy it and get it home.
[32:48.860 --> 32:51.420]  Like we're learning a lot about preservation of terpenes
[32:51.420 --> 32:52.840]  and these concentrates.
[32:53.680 --> 32:55.300]  All right, we got enough battery to keep talking.
[32:55.300 --> 32:57.420]  We can make a podcast out of this.
[32:57.420 --> 32:59.660]  The evolution of the gear and the actual dab.
[32:59.660 --> 33:02.620]  I mentioned before that we had this swing arm skillet.
[33:02.620 --> 33:05.500]  Before we were just stuffing concentrates on top of weed
[33:05.500 --> 33:06.380]  and smoking it like that,
[33:06.700 --> 33:09.380]  we didn't have a real dab pen or a real concentrate device.
[33:09.380 --> 33:11.140]  Then we got the swing arm skillet.
[33:11.140 --> 33:12.540]  That was pretty cool,
[33:12.540 --> 33:14.780]  except sometimes the dabs would roll off the skillet
[33:14.780 --> 33:16.660]  onto your fucking leg or onto the table
[33:16.660 --> 33:18.100]  or you got hot oil on you.
[33:18.100 --> 33:19.100]  Like that shit sucked.
[33:19.100 --> 33:21.780]  That time period, everything was sticky and shit sucked.
[33:21.780 --> 33:24.300]  Torches have come a long way.
[33:24.300 --> 33:25.340]  You got to torch the nail.
[33:25.340 --> 33:26.780]  You got to torch the skillet.
[33:26.780 --> 33:29.000]  Torch companies and torches have come a long way.
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.660]  Big up to all the torch companies that tortured us
[33:31.660 --> 33:33.780]  and helped improve us along the way.
[33:33.820 --> 33:36.460]  Nails, dab nails have come a long way.
[33:36.460 --> 33:39.620]  Back in the day, we used a big ass metal nail,
[33:39.620 --> 33:40.460]  some crap metal.
[33:40.460 --> 33:41.740]  Then it was titanium.
[33:41.740 --> 33:43.620]  Big shout out to our friends, TaskRocket,
[33:43.620 --> 33:45.340]  highly educated titanium.
[33:45.340 --> 33:46.940]  Task changed the game.
[33:46.940 --> 33:48.340]  Then we went from titanium.
[33:48.340 --> 33:50.680]  Everybody switched over to quartz bangers.
[33:50.680 --> 33:51.860]  Then from the banger,
[33:51.860 --> 33:54.460]  everybody switched over to the new Terp Slurper.
[33:54.460 --> 33:57.060]  Things have really changed quickly there.
[33:57.060 --> 33:59.260]  Also, there are e-nails.
[33:59.260 --> 34:01.220]  Oh, let's talk about the torch and the temperature,
[34:01.220 --> 34:02.340]  you guys.
[34:02.340 --> 34:03.620]  Do I have that written down?
[34:04.460 --> 34:05.300]  That's coming up.
[34:05.300 --> 34:06.120]  Yeah, we'll talk about that next.
[34:06.120 --> 34:07.300]  Then we got e-nails.
[34:07.300 --> 34:09.140]  Instead of heating up the nail all the time,
[34:09.140 --> 34:11.240]  we found an e-nail we could set at the right temperature
[34:11.240 --> 34:14.220]  and hit that shit all day long.
[34:14.220 --> 34:15.300]  Then we got a puff co.
[34:15.300 --> 34:17.060]  We started getting electronic devices,
[34:17.060 --> 34:19.660]  the puff cos, dab pins.
[34:19.660 --> 34:20.980]  Then things went crazy from there.
[34:20.980 --> 34:23.520]  Now the options for smoking are fucking endless.
[34:24.680 --> 34:28.920]  One thing I forget to talk about is the Atmos Raw Vape.
[34:28.920 --> 34:30.020]  There was this little device
[34:30.020 --> 34:33.180]  that I watched ruin people's lives.
[34:33.700 --> 34:36.500]  You would put concentrates in a one dram
[34:36.500 --> 34:39.180]  or a half dram glass vial.
[34:39.180 --> 34:40.340]  It sounds like drugs already.
[34:40.340 --> 34:41.860]  It looked like fucking drugs.
[34:41.860 --> 34:43.660]  You'd screw it into this little metal pipe.
[34:43.660 --> 34:45.100]  It was an aluminum apparatus
[34:45.100 --> 34:47.900]  that basically was big enough for your hand to hold.
[34:47.900 --> 34:50.380]  And then you would slowly heat that glass vial
[34:50.380 --> 34:52.420]  that had the concentrates in there with a small torch
[34:52.420 --> 34:53.980]  and you would inhale.
[34:53.980 --> 34:56.580]  It looked and felt a lot like you were doing drugs
[34:56.580 --> 34:59.020]  you really don't want to get caught doing,
[34:59.020 --> 35:01.360]  but the dabs or the dry dabs,
[35:01.360 --> 35:03.400]  it wasn't a dab because it was just a straight
[35:03.400 --> 35:06.160]  dry vapor rip from hot, hot concentrates
[35:06.160 --> 35:08.500]  through a metal pipe and a glass vial.
[35:08.500 --> 35:11.840]  The rips you would get from that could ruin your weekend.
[35:11.840 --> 35:13.160]  You would cough so hard,
[35:13.160 --> 35:15.200]  your lung would come out of one side
[35:15.200 --> 35:16.860]  and your esophagus would pop out,
[35:16.860 --> 35:18.240]  snot would come out of your eye
[35:18.240 --> 35:19.960]  and tears would come out of your nose.
[35:19.960 --> 35:22.040]  It was a fucked up delicious experience.
[35:22.040 --> 35:23.780]  I watched people throw up from that thing.
[35:23.780 --> 35:25.640]  I watched people pass out from it.
[35:25.640 --> 35:27.800]  I got so high, it was beautifully uncomfortable.
[35:27.800 --> 35:29.620]  That thing would ruin people.
[35:29.620 --> 35:31.420]  So the Atmos, I think it was called the Atmos.
[35:31.420 --> 35:33.140]  No, that was a different device.
[35:33.140 --> 35:35.060]  That was not the Atmos Raw, you guys.
[35:35.060 --> 35:36.100]  I was wrong when I said that.
[35:36.100 --> 35:37.420]  What was that fucking thing called?
[35:37.420 --> 35:38.500]  It was metal.
[35:38.500 --> 35:40.580]  I've got one somewhere.
[35:40.580 --> 35:41.540]  I don't know what it's called.
[35:41.540 --> 35:43.700]  That thing would just fucking ruin people's days.
[35:43.700 --> 35:45.460]  It was metal.
[35:45.460 --> 35:47.060]  Might've been the Cloud V.
[35:47.060 --> 35:48.220]  It wasn't that either.
[35:48.220 --> 35:50.780]  There were so many apparatus and devices.
[35:50.780 --> 35:52.660]  We went through, I did say devices on purpose.
[35:52.660 --> 35:54.100]  I was trying to be Bobby Lee.
[35:54.980 --> 35:56.980]  If you think of what that metal fucking thing is called,
[35:56.980 --> 35:59.380]  that a vial screwed into and you heat up the vial
[36:00.140 --> 36:01.060]  and smoke concentrates through that.
[36:01.060 --> 36:02.120]  I'll try to find mine.
[36:02.120 --> 36:03.380]  It's in a box somewhere.
[36:03.380 --> 36:05.940]  I'll post a picture of it if I can find it.
[36:05.940 --> 36:07.300]  That thing used to fuck me up.
[36:07.300 --> 36:08.380]  How are we doing on battery?
[36:08.380 --> 36:09.780]  All right, we're doing good.
[36:09.780 --> 36:10.680]  We are well.
[36:11.620 --> 36:15.700]  Eventually we learned not to heat the dab nail
[36:15.700 --> 36:17.460]  into oblivion like we were trying
[36:17.460 --> 36:19.020]  to reshape the fucking thing.
[36:19.020 --> 36:21.980]  For a long time there, we thought the hotter the dab nail,
[36:21.980 --> 36:23.640]  the better the dab.
[36:23.640 --> 36:25.940]  Then we learned, the term was,
[36:25.940 --> 36:28.000]  you gotta waste it to taste it.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.800]  We developed a thing called a carb cap.
[36:29.800 --> 36:30.760]  We did not.
[36:30.760 --> 36:33.120]  Shout out to my buddy TaskRock.
[36:33.120 --> 36:36.320]  TaskRock is who I know for pioneering the carb cap.
[36:36.320 --> 36:39.000]  It was a device that would go over your dab nail
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.880]  that would trap the heat and oxygen
[36:40.880 --> 36:42.760]  inside the dab nail and limit.
[36:42.760 --> 36:44.200]  Oh man, we used to have domes too.
[36:44.200 --> 36:45.900]  We didn't even talk about domes on the dab rig.
[36:45.900 --> 36:46.740]  We skipped that.
[36:46.740 --> 36:48.280]  How old school are you?
[36:48.280 --> 36:50.420]  If she doesn't know what a dome on a dab nail is,
[36:50.420 --> 36:52.160]  she's not old enough for you, bro.
[36:52.160 --> 36:54.320]  Anyway, we're going to skip right over the domes.
[36:54.320 --> 36:55.200]  You guys know what those were.
[36:55.200 --> 36:56.540]  It was a dome to go over the dab nail
[36:56.540 --> 36:59.660]  so that the smoke didn't get away or trap the air.
[36:59.660 --> 37:01.620]  Eventually, we went to a domeless nail.
[37:01.620 --> 37:03.660]  Then we went to a carb cap.
[37:03.660 --> 37:05.560]  When we started putting the carb cap on,
[37:05.560 --> 37:07.500]  it would trap the heat inside the nail
[37:07.500 --> 37:09.700]  and it would minimize the flow of oxygen,
[37:09.700 --> 37:12.260]  which would create a vacuum on the surface of the nail
[37:12.260 --> 37:15.940]  and give you a much larger, smoother burning dab,
[37:15.940 --> 37:18.900]  a better concentrate, a better vaporization, if you will,
[37:18.900 --> 37:20.680]  without as much heat,
[37:20.680 --> 37:22.300]  which gave you a bigger, better dab
[37:22.300 --> 37:26.320]  without roasting your lungs, which got me higher.
[37:27.100 --> 37:30.240]  It got me less lung pain and it tasted so much better.
[37:30.240 --> 37:34.000]  So we learned the term was taste it to waste it
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.240]  because the cooler dabs, low temp dabs,
[37:36.240 --> 37:37.640]  tend to taste a little bit better
[37:37.640 --> 37:39.720]  because you're not burning off those turps.
[37:39.720 --> 37:41.960]  So over time, we learned to adjust and control
[37:41.960 --> 37:43.880]  our temperatures a little bit better.
[37:43.880 --> 37:45.160]  I still go a little hot.
[37:45.160 --> 37:46.320]  I kind of like a little bit hot,
[37:46.320 --> 37:47.840]  but we have learned quite a bit.
[37:47.840 --> 37:49.400]  The word used to be glowys.
[37:50.320 --> 37:53.520]  We used to do red hot dabs and call them glowys.
[37:53.520 --> 37:56.480]  It'd be glowys for Harambe, glowys for Jesus,
[37:56.480 --> 37:57.700]  whoever it was for that day,
[37:57.700 --> 37:59.960]  but we would do glowys back in the day
[37:59.960 --> 38:01.200]  and they would fucking hurt.
[38:01.200 --> 38:02.560]  My lungs are probably still burned up
[38:02.560 --> 38:04.400]  from a couple of hot, hot glowys.
[38:04.400 --> 38:06.600]  Then I forgot about ninja dabs, bro.
[38:06.600 --> 38:10.140]  Ninja dabs are not on the notes, but a ninja dab.
[38:10.140 --> 38:12.520]  If I'm taking a dab, right, nice and peacefully, right?
[38:12.520 --> 38:14.440]  We're going to act like this is my dab tool.
[38:14.440 --> 38:15.920]  I'm going to take a dab on the microphone here.
[38:15.920 --> 38:17.600]  I'll look into this camera as I do it.
[38:17.600 --> 38:18.760]  But I got my dab.
[38:18.760 --> 38:20.800]  I'm nice and ready, right?
[38:20.800 --> 38:22.840]  As soon as I get my dab to the device,
[38:22.840 --> 38:25.720]  one of my asshole friends reaches in with, guess what?
[38:25.720 --> 38:28.220]  Another dab and doubles up my fucking dab.
[38:28.220 --> 38:29.760]  Now I'm doing two dabs.
[38:29.760 --> 38:31.500]  Didn't expect to do two dabs.
[38:31.500 --> 38:32.600]  That's called the ninja dab.
[38:32.600 --> 38:33.560]  Now I'm going to be double high.
[38:33.560 --> 38:35.520]  I'm going to cough twice as hard.
[38:35.520 --> 38:38.760]  It's kind of a dick move, but also thanks for the dab, bro.
[38:38.760 --> 38:41.820]  Another thing that I used to do, I used to set time bombs.
[38:41.820 --> 38:43.200]  What the fuck is a time bomb?
[38:43.200 --> 38:45.840]  I would put another dab underneath the carb cap
[38:45.840 --> 38:47.640]  so that I wouldn't even have to ninja dab you.
[38:47.640 --> 38:49.880]  You would ninja dab yourself.
[38:49.880 --> 38:52.280]  You would take a dab and then you'd grab the carb cap
[38:52.280 --> 38:53.640]  and you'd set the carb cap on the nail.
[38:53.640 --> 38:54.960]  This is my nail right here for now,
[38:54.960 --> 38:57.240]  for the sake of movie magic here.
[38:57.240 --> 38:58.800]  You'd be doing your dab.
[38:58.800 --> 39:00.680]  Then you'd set your carb cap on there
[39:00.680 --> 39:02.760]  and you'd get more dabs and you'd be like,
[39:02.760 --> 39:04.600]  why is it smokier than ever?
[39:04.600 --> 39:07.600]  And now you got to do two dabs and you only expected one.
[39:07.600 --> 39:10.320]  You just got time bombed or booby trapped.
[39:10.320 --> 39:11.900]  What's wrong with the dab booby trap?
[39:11.900 --> 39:13.700]  Who doesn't want an extra dab?
[39:13.700 --> 39:15.560]  Maybe sometimes you don't want an extra dab,
[39:15.560 --> 39:18.240]  but sorry, dude, you were at Rasta Jeff's house.
[39:18.240 --> 39:19.080]  You got another dab.
[39:19.080 --> 39:19.920]  You're going to be okay.
[39:19.920 --> 39:21.120]  We got cookies and cable.
[39:21.120 --> 39:22.240]  Everything will be all right.
[39:23.080 --> 39:23.920]  All right, let me get my high ass back on track.
[39:23.920 --> 39:26.360]  I do have some notes and we're running out of time.
[39:26.360 --> 39:28.480]  The battery is descending quickly.
[39:30.160 --> 39:32.400]  Bro, we went from smoking goop and crap
[39:32.400 --> 39:34.200]  and questionable shit, shit that I was like,
[39:34.200 --> 39:36.640]  oh, I paid money for this at a fucking dispensary.
[39:36.640 --> 39:39.760]  I bought this dark brown shit that smells like burnt sulfur
[39:39.760 --> 39:41.600]  and it tastes like fish guts when I smoke it.
[39:41.600 --> 39:45.080]  To now we're smoking live rosin, live batters,
[39:45.080 --> 39:46.920]  the best concentrates on the planet
[39:46.920 --> 39:49.280]  through high end quartz at the correct temperature
[39:49.280 --> 39:51.640]  with the fucking thermometer in the dab nail
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.440]  telling me it's just the right temperature.
[39:53.440 --> 39:54.260]  We are spoiled.
[39:54.260 --> 39:56.920]  Now things have come a long way.
[39:56.920 --> 39:58.440]  I've got to say how grateful I am.
[39:58.440 --> 40:00.220]  How, that's the word, dude.
[40:00.220 --> 40:01.120]  I am so grateful.
[40:01.120 --> 40:01.960]  I am spoiled.
[40:01.960 --> 40:04.320]  I love, I really enjoy taking dabs.
[40:04.320 --> 40:07.040]  The act of dabbing is something that really
[40:07.040 --> 40:09.440]  seems to keep me calm and fulfill the day.
[40:09.440 --> 40:10.600]  So I really enjoy dabbing.
[40:10.600 --> 40:12.700]  I'm really great that we have evolved so far.
[40:12.700 --> 40:13.920]  I hope wherever you are,
[40:13.920 --> 40:16.280]  you are evolving as much as we are.
[40:16.280 --> 40:17.980]  If you've got any questions, corrections, comments,
[40:17.980 --> 40:20.280]  or concerns about dabbing, about concentrates,
[40:20.280 --> 40:23.400]  about any of the above, the Cannabis Concentrate community,
[40:23.400 --> 40:26.800]  the scene, whatever, equipment, use, how to do it.
[40:26.800 --> 40:28.040]  I'm not going to teach you how to make it,
[40:28.040 --> 40:29.320]  but let's talk about it.
[40:29.320 --> 40:32.280]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[40:32.280 --> 40:33.120]  Don't be shy.
[40:33.120 --> 40:34.440]  Please do reach out.
[40:34.440 --> 40:37.100]  A lot of this knowledge and science has come along
[40:37.100 --> 40:39.380]  because of the legalization of cannabis.
[40:39.380 --> 40:42.560]  So fight to make cannabis legal where you are.
[40:42.560 --> 40:45.720]  If recreational cannabis is what you need, make that happen.
[40:45.720 --> 40:48.240]  If legal cannabis is the only way to make it happen,
[40:48.240 --> 40:49.180]  make that happen.
[40:49.180 --> 40:51.660]  But let's get cannabis legal nationwide
[40:51.660 --> 40:54.380]  so we can all understand cannabis,
[40:54.380 --> 40:55.840]  the growth of the plant,
[40:55.840 --> 40:57.700]  the process to make the concentrates,
[40:57.700 --> 41:00.620]  and then the enjoyment of dabbing with our friends.
[41:00.620 --> 41:02.100]  Let's all do it together, you guys.
[41:02.100 --> 41:03.400]  Let's legalize cannabis together.
[41:03.400 --> 41:04.560]  Let's take some dabs together.
[41:04.560 --> 41:07.060]  This was episode 709.
[41:07.060 --> 41:09.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes,
[41:09.080 --> 41:12.020]  friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
[41:12.020 --> 41:14.060]  pollen chuckers, flower smokers,
[41:14.060 --> 41:16.180]  and you dab heads out there.
[41:16.180 --> 41:17.580]  I want to thank each and every one of you
[41:17.580 --> 41:18.820]  for listening to another episode
[41:18.820 --> 41:20.660]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[41:20.660 --> 41:21.860]  This was a great show.
[41:21.860 --> 41:22.940]  I had a good time making it.
[41:22.940 --> 41:24.580]  I hope you had as much fun listening.
[41:24.580 --> 41:26.380]  If you feel like the episode was educational,
[41:26.380 --> 41:27.780]  informative, entertaining,
[41:27.780 --> 41:29.820]  maybe you'd just like to throw me a buck for my time,
[41:29.820 --> 41:33.900]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[41:33.900 --> 41:35.220]  forward slash growfromyourheart.

[41:36.540 --> 41:37.960]  is right there on the screen.
[41:37.960 --> 41:39.380]  If I said that too fast,

[41:42.500 --> 41:45.780]  simply visit iRegenetics.com.
[41:45.780 --> 41:46.860]  There's a lot of info there.

[41:48.460 --> 41:50.940]  a link to merchandise, a link to the Discord,
[41:50.940 --> 41:54.460]  and of course, a link to the Patreon,
[41:54.460 --> 41:55.980]  what is it, a Patreon page,
[41:55.980 --> 41:59.140]  a Patreon campaign is what I think we call it.
[41:59.140 --> 42:00.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's all I've got for this episode.
[42:00.980 --> 42:02.980]  I feel like I'm rambling to drag this out.
[42:02.980 --> 42:05.120]  Let's wrap this up before the battery dies.
[42:05.120 --> 42:07.420]  All I can do is ruin a great show from here.
[42:07.420 --> 42:08.540]  See, it's already happening.
[42:08.540 --> 42:09.460]  I knew it was coming.
[42:09.460 --> 42:11.340]  Let's get out of here while we're still winning.
[42:11.340 --> 42:13.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be back in a couple of days
[42:13.020 --> 42:15.060]  with fresh new content.
[42:15.060 --> 42:15.940]  What is wrong with me?
[42:15.940 --> 42:17.300]  Here it goes already.
[42:17.300 --> 42:18.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be back in a couple of days
[42:18.920 --> 42:20.380]  with fresh new content.
[42:20.380 --> 42:22.460]  I wanna give a big shout out to my buddy, Danny Potts,
[42:22.460 --> 42:23.580]  and until next time,
[42:23.580 --> 42:26.400]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
