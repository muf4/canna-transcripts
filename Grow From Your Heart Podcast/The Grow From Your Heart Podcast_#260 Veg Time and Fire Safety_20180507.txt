[00:15.480 --> 00:17.760]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:17.760 --> 00:19.480]  It's time for episode number 260
[00:19.480 --> 00:21.360]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.360 --> 00:24.960]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:24.960 --> 00:26.080]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:26.080 --> 00:27.200]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.200 --> 00:29.640]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.640 --> 00:31.600]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:31.600 --> 00:34.240]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.240 --> 00:37.300]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.300 --> 00:39.160]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.160 --> 00:41.120]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.120 --> 00:43.280]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.280 --> 00:44.920]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:44.920 --> 00:47.320]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.320 --> 00:49.160]  Big shout out to Kat, Coop,
[00:49.160 --> 00:51.760]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.160 --> 00:55.520]  Also, I wanna give a huge shout out
[00:55.520 --> 00:58.400]  to all my friends on my Instagram live feed.
[00:58.400 --> 01:00.200]  I just did a nice little Instagram live feed.
[01:00.200 --> 01:03.440]  I took a couple of dabs, I said some silly shit.
[01:03.440 --> 01:05.080]  Give a shout out to some friends.
[01:06.040 --> 01:07.380]  Thanks for joining me on Instagram live.
[01:07.380 --> 01:09.320]  You guys, if you're not following me on Instagram,
[01:09.320 --> 01:11.280]  it's irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[01:11.280 --> 01:13.880]  You can jump in and follow the Instagram live feeds.
[01:15.160 --> 01:17.280]  The other day, our good friend Subcool the Weed Nerd
[01:17.280 --> 01:18.120]  jumped in there.
[01:18.120 --> 01:19.640]  Big shout out to the Weed Nerd for jumping in.
[01:19.640 --> 01:21.080]  Make sure you guys follow the Weed Nerd.
[01:21.080 --> 01:21.960]  I was honored.
[01:21.960 --> 01:24.200]  Subcool is one of the guys that taught me how to grow,
[01:24.200 --> 01:26.400]  not personally, but through his Weed Nerd videos,
[01:26.400 --> 01:28.520]  through his internet ramblings, through all his posts,
[01:28.520 --> 01:30.480]  through all his blogs, through all of his books,
[01:30.480 --> 01:32.040]  through his photography.
[01:32.040 --> 01:33.380]  Subcool inspired me heavily.
[01:33.380 --> 01:35.600]  So for Subcool to drop into my Instagram live feed
[01:35.600 --> 01:38.480]  and say what's up, that really meant a lot to me.
[01:38.480 --> 01:40.520]  So shout out to all my friends on Instagram live.
[01:40.520 --> 01:44.520]  An extra huge shout out to the man, Subcool the Weed Nerd.
[01:44.560 --> 01:46.020]  All right, let's see.
[01:46.020 --> 01:48.280]  Let me open up this thing so that I don't say this wrong.
[01:48.280 --> 01:49.440]  I've got an email.
[01:49.440 --> 01:51.760]  I was talking to my friends at thedankseed.co
[01:51.760 --> 01:54.920]  at the Hella Dank Seed Bank, and we have decided,
[01:54.920 --> 01:56.560]  oh, I've got it right, where did it go?
[01:56.560 --> 01:58.320]  It's an email and it's right over here.
[01:58.320 --> 02:00.840]  I had it up on my screen, but I have a lot going on.
[02:00.840 --> 02:02.080]  Here's a special announcement, you guys.
[02:02.080 --> 02:03.720]  I am going to turn down this music
[02:03.720 --> 02:06.040]  and I am going to do a very special announcement.
[02:06.040 --> 02:08.000]  You guys on the podcast will hear it second.
[02:08.000 --> 02:09.760]  My friends on Instagram live heard it first,
[02:09.760 --> 02:11.680]  but you're gonna get some extra details here.
[02:11.680 --> 02:13.360]  Here's my special announcement.
[02:13.360 --> 02:16.120]  I'm announcing the Hella Dank Green Friday sale.
[02:16.120 --> 02:18.640]  That's right, on Black Friday, Friday the 24th
[02:18.640 --> 02:21.120]  through Sunday the 26th.
[02:21.120 --> 02:24.460]  All iRegenetic seeds will be $30 a five pack,
[02:24.460 --> 02:26.160]  and if you buy three packs,
[02:26.160 --> 02:29.660]  you get a free pack of Capleton Cross to Arise
[02:29.660 --> 02:32.240]  at the Hella Dank Seed Co.
[02:32.240 --> 02:35.160]  Google them or go to dankseed.co.
[02:35.160 --> 02:37.480]  All the info you need will be right there.
[02:37.480 --> 02:38.720]  Once again, I'll repeat that.
[02:38.720 --> 02:42.160]  All iRegenetics five packs, $30 a five pack.
[02:42.160 --> 02:45.200]  Buy three five packs, get one free five pack
[02:45.200 --> 02:48.320]  of Capleton Cross to Arise
[02:48.320 --> 02:50.920]  until this batch of Capleton to Arise runs out.
[02:50.920 --> 02:51.940]  It doesn't have a name.
[02:51.940 --> 02:54.400]  It may have a fresh new name by the time you get it,
[02:54.400 --> 02:57.240]  but so far, Capleton to Arise doesn't have a name.
[02:57.240 --> 03:01.120]  It's the new freebie over at Dank Seed Co.,
[03:01.120 --> 03:03.320]  the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[03:03.320 --> 03:04.640]  So make sure you guys check them out.
[03:04.640 --> 03:07.200]  Black Friday, that starts the day after Thanksgiving.
[03:07.200 --> 03:08.120]  You don't have to go anywhere.
[03:08.120 --> 03:09.160]  You don't have to go wait in line.
[03:09.160 --> 03:10.160]  You don't have to go fight the snow.
[03:10.160 --> 03:11.560]  You don't have to go fight the people.
[03:11.960 --> 03:13.440]  You don't have to go to Walmart.
[03:13.440 --> 03:15.440]  You can just shop right in the comfort of your own home,
[03:15.440 --> 03:18.160]  in your underwear, taking a dab on the internet
[03:18.160 --> 03:19.880]  while you're listening to this podcast.
[03:19.880 --> 03:22.880]  All right, the Hella Dank Green Friday Sale.
[03:22.880 --> 03:24.000]  Make sure you check them out.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.480]  All right, I think that's all the advertising I'm gonna do.
[03:26.480 --> 03:28.320]  Let's see what's next.
[03:28.320 --> 03:30.680]  Yes, usually I let you guys know what I'm smoking on.
[03:30.680 --> 03:33.760]  Tonight I am smoking on, I've got several packages
[03:33.760 --> 03:34.960]  of fresh new concentrates here.
[03:34.960 --> 03:36.480]  What is this one?
[03:36.480 --> 03:38.560]  This is the Chocolope Shatter
[03:38.560 --> 03:40.320]  from our friends at The Craft.
[03:40.320 --> 03:42.160]  This is the Panacea line.
[03:42.160 --> 03:44.000]  I was really digging the Chocolope.
[03:44.000 --> 03:44.840]  It's a nice sativa.
[03:44.840 --> 03:47.360]  It gets me nice and chattery, obviously.
[03:47.360 --> 03:48.560]  And then of course, I was dabbing,
[03:48.560 --> 03:50.880]  from The Craft, I was dabbing the Stardog OG.
[03:50.880 --> 03:52.800]  I just finished the last of that.
[03:52.800 --> 03:53.920]  Super delicious.
[03:53.920 --> 03:55.400]  I wish I had more.
[03:55.400 --> 03:57.720]  So super huge shout out to our friends at The Craft.
[03:57.720 --> 03:59.680]  The Panacea line is delicious.
[03:59.680 --> 04:01.240]  I really love the Stardog.
[04:01.240 --> 04:02.680]  I gotta quit telling you guys what I like
[04:02.680 --> 04:04.840]  because it's harder to find some stuff now.
[04:04.840 --> 04:06.360]  I go places to get the Stardog.
[04:06.360 --> 04:07.800]  I go places to get certain batters,
[04:07.800 --> 04:09.520]  and it's all sold out because I told my friends
[04:09.520 --> 04:11.120]  about it on the podcast, and they all go there
[04:11.120 --> 04:12.960]  and they buy it before I can get to it.
[04:12.960 --> 04:13.800]  It's all good.
[04:13.800 --> 04:14.640]  You guys go enjoy.
[04:14.640 --> 04:15.560]  I just gotta find more sources
[04:15.560 --> 04:17.600]  and we gotta spread the love a little bit further.
[04:17.600 --> 04:19.200]  Send me a tweet or a Facebook message
[04:19.200 --> 04:20.400]  or an email or something to let me know
[04:20.400 --> 04:21.720]  where you're shopping and where you're getting
[04:21.720 --> 04:23.360]  super turpy hash and what kind of prices
[04:23.360 --> 04:26.700]  you're paying in Colorado, medical or recreational.
[04:26.700 --> 04:27.540]  Tweet me.
[04:27.540 --> 04:29.440]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[04:29.440 --> 04:31.240]  You can, of course, you can find me on Instagram,
[04:31.240 --> 04:34.560]  ireee underscore genetics on Facebook.
[04:34.560 --> 04:36.240]  Go for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[04:36.240 --> 04:37.080]  If you know me personally,
[04:37.080 --> 04:39.080]  send me a message however you want.
[04:39.640 --> 04:41.280]  You can email me, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[04:41.280 --> 04:42.240]  Let me know, what are you dabbing?
[04:42.240 --> 04:43.440]  Where are you getting it?
[04:43.440 --> 04:45.480]  I wanna know what's available that I'm missing.
[04:45.480 --> 04:47.440]  All right, let's move forward a little bit.
[04:47.440 --> 04:48.760]  I have got an email from a listener.
[04:48.760 --> 04:49.880]  I'm reaching for the iPad here.
[04:49.880 --> 04:51.680]  I've got it up on the iPad screen.
[04:52.800 --> 04:54.480]  This email takes a little different approach.
[04:54.480 --> 04:56.640]  It's not what we always think about and talk about
[04:56.640 --> 04:57.520]  when it comes to growing,
[04:57.520 --> 04:59.840]  but it's something that should always be
[04:59.840 --> 05:00.720]  in the back of your mind.
[05:00.720 --> 05:02.080]  It's something you should always think about
[05:02.080 --> 05:03.380]  when you're constructing, designing,
[05:03.380 --> 05:04.880]  or building a grow room.
[05:04.880 --> 05:07.480]  And of course, what I'm talking about is fire safety.
[05:07.520 --> 05:10.000]  So I'm gonna open and read this email.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.960]  Let me see, whose name do I use?
[05:13.960 --> 05:14.880]  I'm gonna have to press pause
[05:14.880 --> 05:16.280]  and see whose name I'm supposed to use on this.
[05:16.280 --> 05:18.080]  We did have a brief conversation,
[05:18.080 --> 05:19.160]  but I'm going to read the email.
[05:19.160 --> 05:19.980]  It goes like this.
[05:19.980 --> 05:21.920]  Dear Rasta Jeff, how are you doing today, brother?
[05:21.920 --> 05:23.640]  I hope your gardens are looking good.
[05:23.640 --> 05:24.920]  And then he says his full name,
[05:24.920 --> 05:26.040]  and he said I can read it on the show.
[05:26.040 --> 05:27.360]  So I'm gonna go ahead and say it.
[05:27.360 --> 05:28.560]  My name is Alex Robles,
[05:28.560 --> 05:30.680]  and I discovered the podcast about six weeks ago,
[05:30.680 --> 05:32.400]  and I really enjoy listening to you
[05:32.400 --> 05:34.200]  hang out and talk about cannabis.
[05:34.200 --> 05:35.380]  I completely appreciate that, man.
[05:35.380 --> 05:36.220]  Thanks for listening.
[05:37.100 --> 05:38.820]  How many episodes have you listened to in six weeks?
[05:38.820 --> 05:39.900]  I hope you're catching up.
[05:39.900 --> 05:41.300]  He also says I'm having a great time
[05:41.300 --> 05:42.740]  catching up with the past episodes
[05:42.740 --> 05:44.700]  and appreciating the block of older ones.
[05:44.700 --> 05:47.420]  They help me get through the mind numbing parts of the day.
[05:47.420 --> 05:50.500]  And so many people tell me that my long episodes
[05:50.500 --> 05:52.020]  help them get through a long shitty day.
[05:52.020 --> 05:53.280]  So I'm glad I'm helping you guys out.
[05:53.280 --> 05:54.900]  Thank you, that means a lot to me.
[05:54.900 --> 05:56.780]  When I started doing those long episodes,
[05:56.780 --> 05:58.860]  I wasn't sure how that was gonna land on my audience,
[05:58.860 --> 06:00.140]  and it seems like you guys enjoy it.
[06:00.140 --> 06:01.140]  So thanks for the compliments,
[06:01.140 --> 06:02.900]  and I'm glad I'm helping you out.
[06:02.900 --> 06:04.500]  The email continues to say,
[06:04.500 --> 06:05.980]  I do fire suppression system,
[06:05.980 --> 06:08.820]  like fire sprinklers and such in California for a living.
[06:08.820 --> 06:11.620]  If I can ever help you in this realm, please let me know.
[06:11.620 --> 06:13.960]  I heard you talk about fire safety in an indoor grow,
[06:13.960 --> 06:15.060]  and I wanted to share with you
[06:15.060 --> 06:18.660]  what I wrote about a product I used in my closet.
[06:18.660 --> 06:19.700]  And then he sends me a link,
[06:19.700 --> 06:21.580]  and he also says you can find me on Instagram,
[06:21.580 --> 06:23.460]  and he gives his Instagram handle.
[06:23.460 --> 06:25.880]  I'm not sure if he wants me to give that out or not,
[06:25.880 --> 06:27.220]  so I'm not going to.
[06:27.220 --> 06:28.420]  If you want me to, bro,
[06:28.420 --> 06:30.060]  send me another message and I'll put it out there.
[06:30.060 --> 06:31.500]  I just don't wanna flood your stuff out.
[06:31.500 --> 06:33.160]  I already said your real name.
[06:33.160 --> 06:35.000]  You said I can read it on the show.
[06:35.000 --> 06:35.880]  It goes on to say,
[06:35.880 --> 06:38.880]  I wanna thank you again for all the great content.
[06:38.880 --> 06:41.420]  And then he calls himself Grow, Learn, Teach.
[06:42.400 --> 06:44.240]  You guys will probably be able to find him on Instagram
[06:44.240 --> 06:46.920]  if you search for Grow, Learn, Teach.
[06:46.920 --> 06:48.000]  Now I'm gonna click the link,
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.920]  and it takes me to an article that our friend Alex wrote.
[06:50.920 --> 06:53.000]  And I'm gonna read you this article.
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.440]  This will be very beneficial for you.
[06:54.440 --> 06:55.800]  He does talk about a product.
[06:55.800 --> 06:57.440]  I'm not paid to pitch a product or anything.
[06:57.440 --> 06:59.120]  I just agree with what's written here,
[06:59.120 --> 07:00.480]  and he happens to pitch this product
[07:00.480 --> 07:02.960]  that is very useful to almost any grower.
[07:03.600 --> 07:04.480]  And I think this may be helpful to a lot of people
[07:04.480 --> 07:05.720]  in a lot of situations.
[07:05.720 --> 07:09.240]  So I'm going to read this piece that he wrote.
[07:09.240 --> 07:10.440]  It goes like this.
[07:10.440 --> 07:12.760]  It's never good when a fire breaks out in an indoor grow,
[07:12.760 --> 07:15.780]  but it's even more tragic when that grow room is in our home.
[07:15.780 --> 07:18.240]  I wanna take this moment to say something about fire safety
[07:18.240 --> 07:19.840]  in an indoor home grow.
[07:19.840 --> 07:21.780]  We've all heard the horror stories of bad wiring,
[07:21.780 --> 07:24.520]  catching fire, or the plant canopy getting too close
[07:24.520 --> 07:26.820]  to a hot light and bursting into flames.
[07:26.820 --> 07:28.320]  We try not to think about it too much
[07:28.320 --> 07:30.600]  because aside from having a clean, safe grow area
[07:30.600 --> 07:32.340]  and a fire extinguisher handy,
[07:32.340 --> 07:35.380]  there is very little we can do when we do have a fire.
[07:35.380 --> 07:37.500]  I work on fire suppression systems for a living,
[07:37.500 --> 07:40.140]  which means I spend eight hours a day talking about,
[07:40.140 --> 07:43.240]  learning about, installing, and maintaining fire systems.
[07:43.240 --> 07:45.580]  I know that a commercial grower has options.
[07:45.580 --> 07:47.460]  However, for our community of home growers,
[07:47.460 --> 07:50.700]  options are limited because our realities are different.
[07:50.700 --> 07:53.180]  We need simplicity because by definition,
[07:53.180 --> 07:57.180]  we're a hands-on group that will do it ourselves if we can.
[07:57.180 --> 07:58.540]  Mobility is a must.
[07:58.540 --> 08:02.660]  When some of us grow in an extra room, closet, or cabinet
[08:02.660 --> 08:05.220]  that sometimes has to be moved.
[08:05.220 --> 08:06.660]  There's also the need for stealth
[08:06.660 --> 08:09.900]  if we're growing our medicine in a prohibition state.
[08:09.900 --> 08:12.380]  For an indoor home grow, there are basically two choices
[08:12.380 --> 08:13.740]  from what I've seen out there.
[08:13.740 --> 08:16.160]  We either have to get an overhead fire sprinkler system
[08:16.160 --> 08:20.380]  or an automatic fire extinguisher, also known as an AFE.
[08:20.380 --> 08:22.620]  And then there's a picture here of an AFE,
[08:22.620 --> 08:24.060]  and it says an AFE.
[08:24.060 --> 08:26.820]  This AFE has been in service since 1993
[08:26.860 --> 08:30.660]  and is designated to cover 60 cubic feet.
[08:30.660 --> 08:33.140]  This little device, it looks basically
[08:33.140 --> 08:35.260]  like a really small fire extinguisher.
[08:35.260 --> 08:36.980]  And they took that fire extinguisher handle
[08:36.980 --> 08:40.060]  with the sprayer off, and it's got a little pressure valve.
[08:40.060 --> 08:44.220]  And it looks like a ceiling sprinkler in an office building,
[08:44.220 --> 08:46.520]  like the fire sprinklers in an office building.
[08:46.520 --> 08:47.900]  And it looks like you would probably hang
[08:47.900 --> 08:49.420]  this thing horizontally.
[08:49.420 --> 08:50.660]  I'm not sure how it would be mounted,
[08:50.660 --> 08:52.220]  how it would be used in the room,
[08:52.220 --> 08:53.640]  but it would go up high, I would assume.
[08:53.640 --> 08:55.460]  And then it would probably rupture
[08:55.460 --> 08:57.300]  when it hit a certain temperature in there.
[08:57.300 --> 08:59.420]  And then whatever's in here will put out your fire,
[08:59.420 --> 09:01.140]  is what I'm assuming from the looks of it.
[09:01.140 --> 09:03.820]  But it just looks like a canister,
[09:03.820 --> 09:06.820]  like a fire extinguisher with a different type of head on it.
[09:06.820 --> 09:08.580]  So I'm gonna continue.
[09:08.580 --> 09:11.080]  It says, growing with fire sprinklers in the room.
[09:11.080 --> 09:13.740]  Some homes come with fire sprinkler systems,
[09:13.740 --> 09:15.700]  which is a great thing if you have a fire.
[09:15.700 --> 09:18.300]  Not so good for the grower in us, and here's why.
[09:18.300 --> 09:20.820]  The pros, they do an excellent job at controlling
[09:20.820 --> 09:23.140]  and knocking down a fire that could burn your house down.
[09:23.140 --> 09:26.140]  The cons, there's going to be a lot of water to clean up
[09:26.140 --> 09:27.600]  when the fire sprinkler goes off.
[09:27.600 --> 09:29.740]  And unless you're using waterproof equipment,
[09:29.740 --> 09:32.200]  you may be looking at a total loss.
[09:32.200 --> 09:33.820]  So if you've got a fire in your grow room
[09:33.820 --> 09:35.500]  and your fire sprinklers go off,
[09:35.500 --> 09:38.260]  your lights, your air conditioning, your dehumidifier,
[09:38.260 --> 09:40.420]  and your crop will be destroyed.
[09:40.420 --> 09:42.220]  It goes on to say, the water that rains down
[09:42.220 --> 09:43.980]  will have some form of bacteria in it
[09:43.980 --> 09:46.620]  because it's been stagnant for so long.
[09:46.620 --> 09:48.300]  Yeah, that water's been sitting in those pipes,
[09:48.300 --> 09:50.700]  it's getting funky, it hasn't been filtered.
[09:50.700 --> 09:52.220]  That's gonna be nasty-ass water.
[09:52.220 --> 09:54.420]  That may get you sick, it's gonna ruin your plants.
[09:54.420 --> 09:56.780]  If the plants are flowering, all that stagnant water
[09:56.780 --> 09:59.300]  will cause mold, that is very true.
[09:59.300 --> 10:00.660]  And who wants to smoke plants that had
[10:00.660 --> 10:02.500]  bacteria-laden sprinkler water on them?
[10:02.500 --> 10:04.620]  That sounds fucking disgusting.
[10:04.620 --> 10:06.700]  The article goes on to say, when the system goes off,
[10:06.700 --> 10:08.900]  bells and alarms will ring, and first responders,
[10:08.900 --> 10:10.620]  such as the fire department and police,
[10:10.620 --> 10:12.900]  will usually show up.
[10:12.900 --> 10:14.300]  You don't need that shit in your grow,
[10:14.300 --> 10:16.780]  especially if you're in an illegal state,
[10:16.780 --> 10:18.060]  and you don't need that anyway.
[10:18.060 --> 10:20.140]  So, I'm gonna keep reading the article.
[10:20.140 --> 10:22.020]  Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[10:22.860 --> 10:23.700]  I'm gonna blame it on the dabs.
[10:23.700 --> 10:25.140]  It goes like this, nothing in this chain of events
[10:25.140 --> 10:27.260]  sounds like a good time, but it could happen
[10:27.260 --> 10:30.140]  when you're growing with a fire sprinkler in the room.
[10:30.140 --> 10:32.860]  Then he says, my AFE lets me sleep better.
[10:32.860 --> 10:34.980]  The thing I found that gives me peace of mind about this
[10:34.980 --> 10:36.980]  is an automatic fire extinguisher.
[10:36.980 --> 10:38.300]  These beautiful pieces of equipment
[10:38.300 --> 10:40.300]  were originally designed to put out fires
[10:40.300 --> 10:41.900]  in boat engine rooms.
[10:41.900 --> 10:43.340]  They've been repurposed over the years
[10:43.340 --> 10:46.220]  to be used in everything from flammable liquid cabinets
[10:46.220 --> 10:48.580]  to server rooms and other enclosed areas
[10:48.580 --> 10:51.180]  where water isn't a good idea.
[10:51.180 --> 10:53.780]  The ones I use are called fire boys
[10:53.780 --> 10:55.660]  and are designed to go off automatically
[10:55.660 --> 10:57.580]  when the grow space or grow room
[10:57.580 --> 11:02.280]  gets to 165 degrees Fahrenheit or 74 degrees Celsius.
[11:02.280 --> 11:03.940]  I have to get the cubic feet,
[11:03.940 --> 11:05.300]  which is the length times the width
[11:05.300 --> 11:07.680]  times the height of the grow room or space
[11:07.680 --> 11:09.740]  to make sure I get the right size unit.
[11:09.740 --> 11:11.300]  Each one will have enough agent in them
[11:11.300 --> 11:13.980]  to easily put out a fire in the size room
[11:13.980 --> 11:15.500]  that it's designed for.
[11:15.500 --> 11:17.700]  I also have to think about ventilation,
[11:17.700 --> 11:18.980]  about the ventilation system
[11:18.980 --> 11:21.300]  when I'm talking about this type of extinguisher.
[11:21.300 --> 11:23.060]  With an active or passive air exchange,
[11:23.060 --> 11:26.220]  a high temp shutoff, excuse me,
[11:26.220 --> 11:29.380]  a high temp shutoff should be put on the fans.
[11:29.380 --> 11:32.260]  These extinguishers work by flooding the room
[11:32.260 --> 11:33.420]  with the agent when they go off.
[11:33.420 --> 11:35.580]  Plus it stays active in the air for a bit
[11:35.580 --> 11:37.920]  to keep things from reigniting.
[11:37.920 --> 11:40.280]  The intake fan could feed oxygen to the fire,
[11:40.280 --> 11:44.700]  which could allow the fire to stay lit or reignite easier.
[11:44.700 --> 11:47.020]  The exhaust fan could suck out the agent from the room
[11:47.020 --> 11:48.860]  before it's done its job.
[11:49.580 --> 11:52.700]  If you do install an automatic fire extinguisher,
[11:52.700 --> 11:57.020]  it would be a good idea to put your blowers on a turnoff.
[11:57.020 --> 11:59.280]  If the heat gets to a, now this sounds weird,
[11:59.280 --> 12:03.820]  but if it gets to 135 degrees and there's a fire in there
[12:03.820 --> 12:05.020]  and you need to turn off the blower
[12:05.020 --> 12:06.340]  to quit feeding oxygen in there,
[12:06.340 --> 12:08.280]  you need to turn off the extraction fan
[12:08.280 --> 12:10.620]  to quit sucking out the fire extinguisher,
[12:10.620 --> 12:12.680]  you should have those on a heat shutoff.
[12:12.680 --> 12:15.540]  It's also a good idea to have your lights on a heat shutoff.
[12:15.540 --> 12:18.460]  If the room gets over 99 degrees
[12:19.100 --> 12:19.940]  and it hits 100 degrees,
[12:19.940 --> 12:21.380]  the light should turn off until it gets back down
[12:21.380 --> 12:23.580]  to 85 degrees and then come back on.
[12:23.580 --> 12:24.500]  That would be ideal.
[12:24.500 --> 12:25.940]  You should have something like that in the grow
[12:25.940 --> 12:28.660]  just to prevent overheating and to prevent fires.
[12:28.660 --> 12:30.300]  So those are some things you should think about.
[12:30.300 --> 12:33.660]  Along with one of these automatic fire extinguishers,
[12:33.660 --> 12:36.380]  you need some heat detection devices
[12:36.380 --> 12:39.380]  that will turn off and on the proper equipment.
[12:39.380 --> 12:40.640]  So I'm gonna keep going.
[12:40.640 --> 12:42.740]  It says, growers note, when you have a fire system,
[12:42.740 --> 12:44.540]  it doesn't mean you're not going to have damage
[12:44.540 --> 12:45.820]  when you have a fire.
[12:45.860 --> 12:48.500]  The system is only there to mitigate loss
[12:48.500 --> 12:49.620]  if there is a fire.
[12:49.620 --> 12:51.920]  You will have smoke, fire, or water damage,
[12:51.920 --> 12:55.100]  and there is no escaping that.
[12:55.100 --> 12:56.540]  Then they show a picture of a whole bunch
[12:56.540 --> 12:58.740]  of these fire suppression devices.
[12:58.740 --> 13:01.660]  It says, current models have a more environmentally safe
[13:01.660 --> 13:06.660]  suppression agent than what was used in 1993.
[13:06.940 --> 13:08.140]  And they keep going with the article.
[13:08.140 --> 13:09.680]  It says, no system is perfect,
[13:09.680 --> 13:11.860]  and there's a good and bad to everything.
[13:11.860 --> 13:13.140]  Fireboys are no different,
[13:13.180 --> 13:17.500]  but they are a lot better than any other AFE on the market.
[13:17.500 --> 13:19.060]  And here is why.
[13:19.060 --> 13:21.380]  The pros, they're rated for class A,
[13:21.380 --> 13:22.680]  which is trash, wood, and paper,
[13:22.680 --> 13:24.160]  and class B, which is liquids,
[13:24.160 --> 13:27.260]  and class C, which is electrical equipment.
[13:27.260 --> 13:29.340]  So you can get the one for the electrical equipment
[13:29.340 --> 13:30.180]  for your grow room.
[13:30.180 --> 13:31.540]  That may be the one you need.
[13:31.540 --> 13:32.860]  There's a lot of electrical shit in there.
[13:32.860 --> 13:35.140]  That's probably what's gonna go wrong.
[13:35.140 --> 13:38.580]  The next pro is, the suppression agent is life-sustaining,
[13:38.580 --> 13:41.140]  which means if it goes off and you're in your grow room,
[13:41.140 --> 13:43.500]  you more than likely won't drop dead where you stand.
[13:43.500 --> 13:46.840]  The air will get a little acidic, but you'll be alive.
[13:46.840 --> 13:49.060]  So some of these agents could probably make you super sick,
[13:49.060 --> 13:51.180]  probably fuck up your lungs, possibly kill you.
[13:51.180 --> 13:53.460]  Sounds like this one's not gonna be so bad if you're there,
[13:53.460 --> 13:54.680]  and it does go off.
[13:56.340 --> 13:58.100]  It goes on to say, the suppressing agent
[13:58.100 --> 13:59.820]  is considered a clean agent,
[13:59.820 --> 14:02.740]  and comes out in a fine mist that won't leave a residue
[14:02.740 --> 14:04.380]  on any equipment surfaces.
[14:04.380 --> 14:07.340]  So there's no powdery film that has to be cleaned off,
[14:07.340 --> 14:10.020]  like with other automatic fire extinguishers.
[14:10.020 --> 14:11.340]  So it sounds like they designed this stuff
[14:11.340 --> 14:13.580]  mostly for like computer rooms and server rooms
[14:13.580 --> 14:16.220]  and shit like that, to where if you do have a fire
[14:16.220 --> 14:17.740]  and these things go off, you could just go in
[14:17.740 --> 14:19.900]  and basically wipe down everything
[14:19.900 --> 14:22.860]  instead of having to get water out of a room.
[14:22.860 --> 14:24.100]  That sounds way easier to me.
[14:24.100 --> 14:25.360]  It already sounds like a good idea.
[14:25.360 --> 14:27.240]  And nobody has paid me to read this or say this.
[14:27.240 --> 14:28.820]  I just found this very useful.
[14:28.820 --> 14:30.740]  I like keeping my friends and my growers safe,
[14:30.740 --> 14:32.820]  and my listeners, I want everybody to be safe.
[14:32.820 --> 14:35.020]  A lot of you may have overlooked the importance
[14:35.020 --> 14:37.600]  of fire control, fire extinguishing.
[14:37.600 --> 14:38.780]  That's why we're doing this.
[14:38.780 --> 14:40.100]  So I'm gonna keep on going.
[14:40.100 --> 14:41.860]  It says, they come in different sizes
[14:41.860 --> 14:42.980]  to cover different size rooms,
[14:42.980 --> 14:46.700]  from 25 cubic feet to over a thousand cubic feet.
[14:46.700 --> 14:49.740]  It also says no bells or alarms will sound
[14:49.740 --> 14:53.100]  when these go off, unless you set it up to do so,
[14:53.100 --> 14:54.460]  which is a great thing.
[14:54.460 --> 14:55.660]  Like we talked about earlier,
[14:55.660 --> 14:57.420]  if you have a fire and some alarms go off,
[14:57.420 --> 14:59.380]  some bells and whistles start going off,
[14:59.380 --> 15:00.200]  guess who's coming?
[15:00.200 --> 15:02.260]  The police and the fire department.
[15:02.260 --> 15:04.020]  And then maybe if you're in the wrong place,
[15:04.020 --> 15:05.360]  the DE fucking A.
[15:05.360 --> 15:06.740]  You don't wanna get yourself in trouble
[15:06.740 --> 15:09.260]  because you had a fire trying to produce medicine.
[15:09.260 --> 15:10.900]  So these may help you out.
[15:10.900 --> 15:13.300]  It also says they will ship to almost anywhere
[15:13.300 --> 15:15.780]  in the world, which is always a plus.
[15:15.780 --> 15:18.380]  Here are the cons of using this product here.
[15:18.380 --> 15:20.420]  It says the clean agent has not been tested
[15:20.420 --> 15:22.900]  on fruits or vegetables, much less cannabis.
[15:22.900 --> 15:25.860]  If it goes off in a room with flowering plants in it,
[15:25.860 --> 15:27.500]  that bud is a loss in my opinion,
[15:27.500 --> 15:29.900]  because I just don't know if it's safe.
[15:29.900 --> 15:31.100]  I would agree with that.
[15:31.100 --> 15:32.380]  If you do have a fire in there
[15:32.380 --> 15:33.780]  and this little extinguisher goes off
[15:33.780 --> 15:35.980]  and it releases its agent, which is a secret.
[15:35.980 --> 15:37.300]  So I wanna call it the secret agent.
[15:37.300 --> 15:38.740]  They haven't told me what's in there yet.
[15:38.740 --> 15:39.980]  But when the secret agent pops out
[15:39.980 --> 15:41.220]  and gets all over your buds,
[15:41.220 --> 15:42.680]  you do not wanna smoke that stuff.
[15:42.680 --> 15:44.220]  I have smoked the shit, or not smoked,
[15:44.220 --> 15:45.860]  I've smelled the shit that comes out
[15:45.860 --> 15:47.780]  of a fire extinguisher before.
[15:47.780 --> 15:48.620]  There was a fire somewhere,
[15:48.620 --> 15:50.140]  I had to spray the fire extinguisher.
[15:50.140 --> 15:51.020]  That stuff stinks.
[15:51.020 --> 15:52.460]  If it smells anything like that,
[15:52.460 --> 15:53.900]  I don't want it near the buds.
[15:53.900 --> 15:56.300]  If it does get on the buds, don't make hash out of them.
[15:56.300 --> 15:58.760]  Don't smoke them, dispose of them properly.
[15:58.760 --> 16:00.220]  Be glad that you didn't burn to death.
[16:00.220 --> 16:02.180]  Be glad that you didn't have a big fire.
[16:02.180 --> 16:04.100]  Live to grow another crop.
[16:04.100 --> 16:05.700]  All right, we're gonna continue.
[16:06.700 --> 16:08.100]  It says, where was I?
[16:08.100 --> 16:08.940]  Here I am.
[16:08.940 --> 16:11.620]  You can't pull a unit out of one room
[16:11.620 --> 16:14.140]  and put it in a bigger room and expect it to work the same.
[16:14.140 --> 16:15.980]  It won't have enough agent to put out a fire
[16:15.980 --> 16:16.820]  in the bigger room.
[16:16.820 --> 16:19.900]  You can, however, pull one out of a small room
[16:19.900 --> 16:22.420]  or out of a larger room and put it into a smaller room.
[16:22.420 --> 16:23.620]  No problem.
[16:23.620 --> 16:26.100]  It also says you can only get them through a distributor.
[16:26.100 --> 16:28.620]  You can't find them at a hardware store.
[16:28.620 --> 16:30.820]  So you may have to Google them, find them online.
[16:30.820 --> 16:33.700]  It also says, I hope this information encourages everyone,
[16:33.700 --> 16:35.820]  every one of you, to think about fire safety
[16:36.660 --> 16:38.140]  differently, especially if you and your family
[16:38.140 --> 16:39.900]  live in the house in which you grow.
[16:39.900 --> 16:42.380]  If you want more information about different fire systems
[16:42.380 --> 16:44.780]  or how to size and order a Fireboy,
[16:44.780 --> 16:49.060]  get ahold of me and as always, grow, learn, teach.
[16:49.060 --> 16:53.020]  And I found this at inmygrow.com is where the link took me.
[16:53.020 --> 16:54.780]  And he has got a lot of stuff up here.
[16:54.780 --> 16:56.620]  Getting started from seed is a link.
[16:56.620 --> 16:57.820]  Nutrient guide is a link.
[16:57.820 --> 16:59.580]  I'm gonna click on this getting started from seed link
[16:59.580 --> 17:01.460]  and just see what it says and what it does.
[17:01.460 --> 17:03.680]  Can this plant in the vegetative state part three?
[17:03.680 --> 17:04.520]  Oh, look, he's gone.
[17:04.520 --> 17:06.480]  He's made a lot of stuff, you guys.
[17:06.480 --> 17:10.120]  Hey, go check out this guy's website, inmygrow.com.
[17:10.120 --> 17:11.760]  He's done a lot of work.
[17:11.760 --> 17:13.400]  He has put in a lot of articles
[17:13.400 --> 17:15.080]  and it looks like he's been at it for a long time
[17:15.080 --> 17:19.360]  because some of these are from the middle of 2016.
[17:19.360 --> 17:22.040]  So you guys go check out inmygrow.com.
[17:22.040 --> 17:25.960]  Hey, Alex, thank you for printing such cool articles
[17:25.960 --> 17:27.880]  and being such a great cannabis warrior.
[17:27.880 --> 17:31.360]  I am marking your site in my iPad here
[17:31.360 --> 17:33.320]  so that I can go back and visit more frequently
[17:33.320 --> 17:34.880]  and see what else you've got going on.
[17:34.880 --> 17:36.400]  Hey man, thanks for the great email.
[17:36.400 --> 17:40.200]  Thanks for helping me keep the growers and listeners safe.
[17:40.200 --> 17:43.620]  A lot of people may not think about fire safety.
[17:43.620 --> 17:45.120]  You gotta be cool about fire safety
[17:45.120 --> 17:46.800]  is what I think the commercial says, you guys.
[17:46.800 --> 17:47.620]  So thanks a lot.
[17:47.620 --> 17:48.720]  I do appreciate the email.
[17:48.720 --> 17:52.060]  I do appreciate listener generated content.
[17:52.060 --> 17:53.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you've got an email
[17:53.360 --> 17:54.640]  you'd like to send to me,
[17:54.640 --> 17:56.060]  if you've got an article you'd like me to read,
[17:56.060 --> 17:56.960]  it's gotta be your article.
[17:56.960 --> 17:58.640]  You can't just send me some shit that somebody else wrote
[17:58.640 --> 17:59.680]  and expect me to read it.
[17:59.680 --> 18:01.440]  This guy gave me permission to read his article.
[18:01.440 --> 18:02.760]  I do appreciate it.
[18:03.120 --> 18:03.960]  But if you've written some stuff
[18:03.960 --> 18:04.960]  and you'd like me to review it
[18:04.960 --> 18:06.560]  and possibly read it on the show,
[18:06.560 --> 18:07.480]  send it to me in an email.
[18:07.480 --> 18:10.120]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[18:10.120 --> 18:11.600]  Obviously my throat's doing this thing.
[18:11.600 --> 18:13.960]  I don't wanna sit here and clear my throat for 30 seconds.
[18:13.960 --> 18:15.080]  I'm gonna press pause real quick,
[18:15.080 --> 18:16.880]  take a dab, take a drink,
[18:16.880 --> 18:18.600]  and then hopefully I'll be right back.
[18:18.600 --> 18:20.200]  Thanks for listening, you guys.
[18:20.200 --> 18:23.200]  All right, podcast world, welcome back.
[18:23.200 --> 18:24.640]  Thanks for hanging on for a second there
[18:24.640 --> 18:26.180]  while I fixed my voice.
[18:26.180 --> 18:27.960]  Before we get back into this,
[18:27.960 --> 18:31.200]  I owe an apology to some friends of mine up there
[18:31.200 --> 18:33.520]  in the frozen fucking state of Maine.
[18:33.520 --> 18:37.040]  On the last episode, Mike and I were talking about Maine
[18:37.040 --> 18:38.920]  and Mike kinda said some things about Maine
[18:38.920 --> 18:40.840]  and I kinda said some things about Maine.
[18:40.840 --> 18:43.280]  And Maine, I owe you an apology.
[18:43.280 --> 18:45.040]  I got called out on Facebook.
[18:45.040 --> 18:46.520]  So big shout out to my friends, Nick.
[18:46.520 --> 18:48.120]  Shout out to Amber.
[18:48.120 --> 18:49.320]  Maine's not that bad, you guys.
[18:49.320 --> 18:50.640]  There are some cool people up there.
[18:50.640 --> 18:53.000]  I'm sure of it because when we talk trash about them,
[18:53.000 --> 18:54.640]  all six of the cool people up there
[18:54.640 --> 18:56.780]  sent me a message on Facebook.
[18:56.780 --> 18:58.440]  Shout out to my friends in Maine.
[18:59.280 --> 19:01.200]  All right, let's move forward a little bit.
[19:01.200 --> 19:03.240]  I've been asked a couple of questions recently
[19:03.240 --> 19:06.060]  about veg times and what type of veg times I prefer,
[19:06.060 --> 19:08.680]  recommend, and what type of veg times I use.
[19:08.680 --> 19:10.400]  So when your plants are in the vegetative state,
[19:10.400 --> 19:12.040]  you've got a lot of options.
[19:12.040 --> 19:14.000]  The main goal is to keep them vegging
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.480]  until they're big enough, healthy enough, hearty enough,
[19:16.480 --> 19:19.160]  the shape you need them, the size you need them.
[19:19.160 --> 19:20.760]  Make sure everything's topped and trained
[19:20.760 --> 19:21.800]  and set up the way you want it
[19:21.800 --> 19:24.060]  before you put it into the flowering state.
[19:24.060 --> 19:26.480]  Now, the way to keep a plant in the vegetative state
[19:26.480 --> 19:28.220]  is by controlling the light.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.100]  Cannabis is a photo period sensitive plant,
[19:31.100 --> 19:33.040]  which means if you give it enough light,
[19:33.040 --> 19:34.340]  it will stay in a veg state.
[19:34.340 --> 19:35.800]  But when the light starts reducing
[19:35.800 --> 19:37.080]  and you get a certain amount
[19:37.080 --> 19:38.700]  of uninterrupted hours of darkness,
[19:38.700 --> 19:41.580]  that plant will go into its bloom stage.
[19:41.580 --> 19:43.100]  Cannabis' whole goal in life,
[19:43.100 --> 19:45.260]  like a lot of us, is to reproduce.
[19:45.260 --> 19:49.420]  All cannabis wants to do is drop pollen or get pollinated.
[19:49.420 --> 19:50.380]  That's its main goal.
[19:50.380 --> 19:52.460]  It wants to reproduce, make seeds,
[19:52.460 --> 19:55.020]  so that it can grow the next generation next year.
[19:55.020 --> 19:57.880]  So you can keep it into a vegetative state
[19:58.560 --> 19:59.480]  by controlling the light.
[19:59.480 --> 20:01.280]  If the plant gets enough light,
[20:01.280 --> 20:03.360]  it will not go into a bloom stage.
[20:03.360 --> 20:05.360]  As soon as that plant gets a long enough
[20:05.360 --> 20:08.260]  uninterrupted dark period, it will start flowering.
[20:08.260 --> 20:10.320]  It will go into a bloom stage.
[20:10.320 --> 20:11.680]  So we control the lights,
[20:11.680 --> 20:13.880]  we control the amount of time that the lights are on
[20:13.880 --> 20:15.200]  and that the lights are off.
[20:15.200 --> 20:17.440]  So some plants are very sensitive.
[20:17.440 --> 20:20.320]  They have what's called a very sensitive critical period.
[20:20.320 --> 20:22.640]  If they get just a few hours of darkness,
[20:22.640 --> 20:23.920]  they will start to flower.
[20:23.920 --> 20:25.920]  Some of them, you have to go kind of hard,
[20:25.920 --> 20:27.960]  which is why we do the 12-12.
[20:27.960 --> 20:30.540]  That almost all plants will flip at 12-12.
[20:30.540 --> 20:33.560]  You could probably get them to flip at 14 and 16,
[20:33.560 --> 20:36.600]  but 12-12 seems to be the universal combination
[20:36.600 --> 20:38.160]  to get every plant to flip.
[20:38.160 --> 20:41.600]  11-13 is also common, but 12-12 is your best bet.
[20:41.600 --> 20:42.960]  You'll get the best harvest.
[20:42.960 --> 20:44.760]  You'll see the best production.
[20:44.760 --> 20:46.200]  Now I'm really gonna get off topic here
[20:46.200 --> 20:47.120]  and get off on a side ramp,
[20:47.120 --> 20:48.200]  but you'll notice outside,
[20:48.200 --> 20:49.840]  when you flower your plants outside,
[20:49.840 --> 20:52.180]  they do start to flower before you have
[20:52.180 --> 20:54.600]  12 hours of darkness outside.
[20:54.600 --> 20:57.160]  That's because not all of the plants need 12-12.
[20:57.160 --> 20:58.480]  That's just what we do indoors
[20:58.480 --> 21:01.200]  because the light isn't as strong.
[21:01.200 --> 21:02.200]  It's just better.
[21:02.200 --> 21:04.080]  It's better for commercial production.
[21:04.080 --> 21:06.000]  Also, here's something that I will add.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.840]  When the sun sets, the sun puts off a specific spectrum
[21:09.840 --> 21:12.400]  that tells the plant, hey, it's time to go to sleep.
[21:12.400 --> 21:14.200]  So it kind of triggers the plant to go to sleep.
[21:14.200 --> 21:17.680]  That's why things like sometimes light streetlights
[21:17.680 --> 21:19.600]  and things don't disrupt plants outside.
[21:19.600 --> 21:20.520]  Sometimes they will.
[21:20.520 --> 21:21.920]  This depends on the plant.
[21:21.920 --> 21:23.640]  This always depends on the plant.
[21:23.640 --> 21:26.000]  But sometimes some small lights outdoors
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.080]  will not disrupt your flowering period
[21:28.080 --> 21:30.440]  because the sun was so intense all day.
[21:30.440 --> 21:32.040]  It was like, you're awake, bitch.
[21:32.040 --> 21:33.480]  And it was just beaming down on that plant.
[21:33.480 --> 21:36.320]  And as it sat, as the sun sat,
[21:36.320 --> 21:38.600]  I believe in a globe that we got around earth.
[21:38.600 --> 21:40.720]  As the sun set, the curvature of the earth
[21:40.720 --> 21:41.960]  creates a certain spectrum.
[21:41.960 --> 21:43.640]  And I don't understand exactly how this happens,
[21:43.640 --> 21:45.720]  but the curvature of the earth and the sun setting
[21:45.720 --> 21:47.560]  creates a spectrum of red.
[21:47.560 --> 21:49.260]  And that red spectrum, I could go into that,
[21:49.260 --> 21:51.200]  but I didn't read, so I don't want to be wrong.
[21:51.200 --> 21:53.540]  Sometimes I need a little reading to do a refresher,
[21:53.540 --> 21:55.820]  but the near red and far red and phytochrome red words
[21:55.820 --> 21:57.300]  all come into play right here.
[21:57.300 --> 21:58.780]  As the sun sets, it tells the plant,
[21:58.780 --> 21:59.860]  hey, it's time to go to sleep.
[21:59.860 --> 22:02.140]  And so that plant actually goes to sleep.
[22:02.140 --> 22:03.700]  And when the sun puts it to sleep like that,
[22:03.700 --> 22:06.780]  it's way harder to disrupt that nighttime period.
[22:06.780 --> 22:09.900]  So outdoors, yes, sometimes people say the moon
[22:09.900 --> 22:12.000]  and the stars won't disrupt my outdoor plants,
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.200]  but that's not exactly how it works.
[22:14.200 --> 22:16.500]  They've been out there getting beat up by the sun all day.
[22:16.500 --> 22:19.300]  They haven't been indoors under a thousand watt Govita.
[22:19.300 --> 22:21.220]  It's a big difference.
[22:21.220 --> 22:24.140]  So let me get back to what I was talking about.
[22:24.140 --> 22:25.860]  I really like to get off on a rant sometimes
[22:25.860 --> 22:27.220]  on these podcasts, don't I?
[22:27.220 --> 22:28.980]  Sometimes that's what I think you're listening for.
[22:28.980 --> 22:30.300]  Sometimes that's my favorite part.
[22:30.300 --> 22:31.780]  It's when I learn the most.
[22:31.780 --> 22:34.220]  Let's see, so we've talked about what makes them flower.
[22:34.220 --> 22:35.040]  What makes them flowers?
[22:35.040 --> 22:36.820]  You put them under 12, 12, you guys.
[22:36.820 --> 22:39.200]  Outdoors, the sun will tell them it's time to go to sleep,
[22:39.200 --> 22:40.420]  bitches, it's time to flower.
[22:40.420 --> 22:42.040]  Indoors, you got to put them under the 12, 12,
[22:42.040 --> 22:43.340]  they start going to sleep.
[22:43.340 --> 22:46.040]  Veg times, you've got a couple of options here.
[22:46.880 --> 22:51.360]  The options that you have for veg time is 24 hours on.
[22:51.360 --> 22:53.920]  Your plants will live if you put them on
[22:53.920 --> 22:55.920]  with 24 hours of light.
[22:55.920 --> 22:58.040]  If your lights are not very strong,
[22:58.040 --> 23:01.080]  if you're using T5s to keep some big mother plants alive,
[23:01.080 --> 23:03.640]  24 hours may be the way to go.
[23:03.640 --> 23:05.700]  If the plants don't get enough light,
[23:05.700 --> 23:07.980]  yes, they may have a long light period,
[23:07.980 --> 23:10.000]  but also if the light is weak,
[23:10.000 --> 23:11.800]  they may decide to flower on you.
[23:11.800 --> 23:13.460]  I've seen people have big mother plants
[23:13.460 --> 23:15.460]  where the insides get real bushy and leafy
[23:15.900 --> 23:17.220]  and the inside will start flowering.
[23:17.220 --> 23:19.700]  You got to get in there and cut all that inside shit out.
[23:19.700 --> 23:21.980]  If you have more light, that won't happen.
[23:21.980 --> 23:23.400]  So if you don't have enough light,
[23:23.400 --> 23:26.260]  instead of running an 18 hour veg period,
[23:26.260 --> 23:28.540]  put it on 24 hours, that may help you out.
[23:28.540 --> 23:30.360]  You still need to get in there and take care of the plants,
[23:30.360 --> 23:32.780]  but a 24 hour veg time is possible.
[23:32.780 --> 23:34.820]  It's not my favorite.
[23:34.820 --> 23:36.260]  Myself and a lot of other growers
[23:36.260 --> 23:38.580]  believe that everything wants to sleep.
[23:38.580 --> 23:40.500]  My clones are on for 24 hours a day.
[23:40.500 --> 23:42.220]  When I cut my clones and they're fresh,
[23:42.220 --> 23:43.680]  I keep them on for 24 hours.
[23:43.680 --> 23:45.220]  The clones don't get any sleeping period.
[23:45.980 --> 23:48.540]  Once they go into a veg cup or a veg pot,
[23:48.540 --> 23:50.820]  those get a sleeping period.
[23:50.820 --> 23:53.460]  And depending on where I am and what I'm doing,
[23:53.460 --> 23:54.980]  the veg period changes.
[23:54.980 --> 23:57.360]  So let's talk about a couple of different options.
[23:57.360 --> 24:01.260]  There's 20 on and four off, or 19 on and five off,
[24:01.260 --> 24:02.900]  which are very similar.
[24:02.900 --> 24:05.180]  This is very common in a mother room,
[24:05.180 --> 24:07.840]  either 19 and five or 20 and four.
[24:07.840 --> 24:09.660]  Very common in a mother room.
[24:09.660 --> 24:11.940]  That's long enough to keep the plants
[24:11.940 --> 24:13.540]  in a constant veg stage,
[24:13.540 --> 24:15.500]  so that anything that gets root bound
[24:15.500 --> 24:19.640]  or likes to auto flower if it doesn't get enough light,
[24:19.640 --> 24:21.580]  those things will not auto flower on you
[24:21.580 --> 24:24.380]  under a 19 or 20 hour light cycle.
[24:24.380 --> 24:27.100]  But then you get that four hours of sleep.
[24:27.100 --> 24:28.380]  I feel like indoors it takes them
[24:28.380 --> 24:29.940]  like an hour to fall asleep.
[24:29.940 --> 24:32.600]  If you're not giving it the light cycle from outside,
[24:32.600 --> 24:34.140]  if it's not getting the sun to tell it to sleep,
[24:34.140 --> 24:36.520]  I think when the lights just go off and they're blank,
[24:36.520 --> 24:37.700]  it's like, what?
[24:37.700 --> 24:38.680]  And it takes them a few minutes,
[24:38.680 --> 24:40.240]  probably like a full hour to get to sleep.
[24:40.240 --> 24:41.780]  So if you give them four hours,
[24:41.780 --> 24:43.460]  and they're gonna get three full hours of sleep,
[24:43.460 --> 24:46.300]  technically, and that helps.
[24:46.300 --> 24:48.420]  I think everything that's alive wants some sleeping time.
[24:48.420 --> 24:50.660]  You'll see them grow a little bit when they come back on.
[24:50.660 --> 24:52.060]  Even if you just give them the four hours
[24:52.060 --> 24:53.140]  or five hours of darkness,
[24:53.140 --> 24:55.540]  you'll see growth when they come back on.
[24:55.540 --> 24:56.940]  That works very well.
[24:56.940 --> 25:00.340]  Let's talk about the pros and cons of the 24 hour time.
[25:00.340 --> 25:01.940]  24 hour lights on.
[25:01.940 --> 25:04.540]  The pros of that, lots of growth,
[25:04.540 --> 25:06.140]  things will not auto flower.
[25:06.140 --> 25:07.760]  If you've got something that did flower,
[25:07.760 --> 25:10.780]  you can bring it back to veg with 24 hours of time.
[25:10.780 --> 25:12.940]  The con of 24 hour time.
[25:12.940 --> 25:13.820]  It's always on, man.
[25:13.820 --> 25:15.200]  You're always running your electricity,
[25:15.200 --> 25:16.460]  always running your gear,
[25:16.460 --> 25:17.900]  your plants don't get to sleep.
[25:17.900 --> 25:19.740]  They start to look a little frazzled.
[25:19.740 --> 25:21.740]  The 24 and 19.5.
[25:21.740 --> 25:23.380]  The 20 on and four off,
[25:23.380 --> 25:25.340]  or the 19 on five off cycle,
[25:25.340 --> 25:26.180]  pros and cons here.
[25:26.180 --> 25:29.380]  The pros to this, vigorous growth.
[25:29.380 --> 25:31.080]  They get a little bit of sleeping time as a con.
[25:31.080 --> 25:32.320]  You save some electricity,
[25:32.320 --> 25:33.420]  you save some cooling time,
[25:33.420 --> 25:34.980]  you save time on your bulbs.
[25:34.980 --> 25:35.820]  It makes stuff,
[25:35.820 --> 25:37.860]  all your equipment will last four hours longer now.
[25:37.860 --> 25:40.100]  Every day you get four more hours out of your gear.
[25:40.100 --> 25:42.140]  So that adds up to a few more days.
[25:42.140 --> 25:43.540]  The downside to that,
[25:43.540 --> 25:45.380]  I think a little more sleep time is better.
[25:45.380 --> 25:47.740]  You don't get enough rest time on your plants.
[25:47.740 --> 25:48.860]  They're just not as happy.
[25:48.860 --> 25:50.620]  You can see that they're a little bit stressed.
[25:50.620 --> 25:52.500]  From other plants, this is cool.
[25:52.500 --> 25:56.700]  But I think a little less light time is better.
[25:56.700 --> 25:58.380]  One thing that I do notice,
[25:58.380 --> 26:01.660]  the people that use longer veg times,
[26:01.660 --> 26:03.280]  when you go into flower,
[26:03.280 --> 26:05.900]  your plants do flip a little more quickly
[26:05.900 --> 26:07.620]  than people that use a shorter veg time.
[26:07.620 --> 26:08.820]  Because the plants notice.
[26:08.820 --> 26:11.420]  They're like, wait, it just went from summer to fall.
[26:11.420 --> 26:12.340]  I need to flower.
[26:12.340 --> 26:14.380]  They just jump in more quickly.
[26:14.380 --> 26:16.460]  And we're gonna talk more about
[26:16.460 --> 26:18.900]  changing flowering from veg to flower.
[26:18.900 --> 26:20.180]  Do you want that dark period or not?
[26:20.180 --> 26:22.580]  We're gonna talk about that in a future episode.
[26:22.580 --> 26:24.200]  So we've done the 24,
[26:24.200 --> 26:27.740]  we've done the 19 and five or 20 slash four periods.
[26:27.740 --> 26:29.300]  The pros and cons of those.
[26:29.300 --> 26:30.700]  Then here are my two favorites.
[26:30.700 --> 26:33.060]  The 18 on and six hours off.
[26:33.060 --> 26:35.760]  That is a very good veg phase.
[26:35.880 --> 26:40.200]  18 hours on is plenty of time for those plants to grow
[26:40.200 --> 26:41.720]  and suck up their favorite nutrient,
[26:41.720 --> 26:43.560]  their favorite feeder, which is light.
[26:43.560 --> 26:45.800]  The plants want light more than anything.
[26:45.800 --> 26:47.560]  So that's 18 hours to absorb light.
[26:47.560 --> 26:49.160]  That lets them get a lot of vigorous growth.
[26:49.160 --> 26:52.420]  Then six hours, it lets all of your equipment cool down.
[26:52.420 --> 26:54.200]  You're not running so much equipment.
[26:54.200 --> 26:56.080]  The electricity is not being pulled.
[26:56.080 --> 26:57.120]  The plants get to rest.
[26:57.120 --> 26:58.240]  Your bulbs get to rest.
[26:58.240 --> 26:59.720]  You get some dark time.
[26:59.720 --> 27:00.800]  That's always a good thing.
[27:00.800 --> 27:01.800]  The plants get to sleep.
[27:01.800 --> 27:02.680]  They grow.
[27:02.680 --> 27:06.020]  There's also 16 on and eight hours off.
[27:06.020 --> 27:08.040]  That's probably the last one I would recommend.
[27:08.040 --> 27:10.660]  I wouldn't go less than 16 because indoors,
[27:10.660 --> 27:12.120]  you're probably gonna start flowering
[27:12.120 --> 27:15.780]  if you go less than 16 hours of light on 18 hours off.
[27:16.680 --> 27:20.160]  So the pros and cons of the 18 and six,
[27:20.160 --> 27:21.520]  you get some off time.
[27:21.520 --> 27:22.680]  During that sleeping time,
[27:22.680 --> 27:24.320]  you can see the plants grow.
[27:24.320 --> 27:25.840]  They get more vigorous.
[27:25.840 --> 27:27.780]  Although you are gonna produce more humidity
[27:27.780 --> 27:28.620]  in those nighttimes,
[27:28.620 --> 27:29.440]  you're gonna have to find a way
[27:29.440 --> 27:30.800]  to get the humidity out of there.
[27:30.800 --> 27:34.080]  That may get really humid in those long night periods.
[27:34.080 --> 27:36.200]  So those are veg times that I would recommend.
[27:36.200 --> 27:37.760]  The pros and cons,
[27:37.760 --> 27:39.880]  it's kind of up to you how you wanna do it,
[27:39.880 --> 27:41.720]  where you are, how much electricity costs,
[27:41.720 --> 27:42.840]  what your schedule is,
[27:42.840 --> 27:44.180]  what your rooms are set up like,
[27:44.180 --> 27:45.720]  what your lifestyle's like,
[27:45.720 --> 27:48.280]  just how your growth fits into your current scheduling.
[27:48.280 --> 27:49.620]  One thing I can recommend,
[27:49.620 --> 27:52.560]  maybe run your lights at night if that's possible
[27:52.560 --> 27:55.320]  because electricity is cheaper at night.
[27:55.320 --> 27:57.520]  It's easier to keep them cool at night
[27:57.520 --> 27:59.540]  because you're not competing with the sun.
[27:59.540 --> 28:01.740]  And then when the lights go off during the day
[28:01.740 --> 28:02.620]  and the sun comes up,
[28:02.620 --> 28:04.300]  you don't have to try to fight with the grow light
[28:04.300 --> 28:06.580]  and the sun keeping that grow room cool.
[28:06.580 --> 28:08.080]  You can run the air conditioning anyway
[28:08.080 --> 28:10.460]  just to keep the room a little bit cooler during the day.
[28:10.460 --> 28:12.300]  And hopefully nobody thinks anything's going on
[28:12.300 --> 28:14.460]  because it's normal to run an air conditioner.
[28:14.460 --> 28:16.260]  Right now it's winter time.
[28:16.260 --> 28:17.460]  If you've got to grow,
[28:17.460 --> 28:20.020]  you should probably be using that grow now
[28:20.020 --> 28:21.620]  because you don't have to pay for cooling.
[28:21.620 --> 28:24.100]  It really helps out in the winter.
[28:24.100 --> 28:25.840]  But I'm off topic a little bit.
[28:25.840 --> 28:26.680]  Veg times.
[28:26.680 --> 28:28.000]  I told you about a bunch of veg times
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.720]  and I told you different applications of them.
[28:30.720 --> 28:33.120]  At the large commercial facility,
[28:33.120 --> 28:35.600]  I keep the veg room on,
[28:35.600 --> 28:37.920]  it's on 20 on and four off.
[28:37.920 --> 28:40.100]  Sometimes we do 20 on and five off.
[28:40.100 --> 28:41.720]  We're experimenting.
[28:41.720 --> 28:44.480]  When you're running a lot of lights in a large facility,
[28:44.480 --> 28:46.800]  every couple of hours helps.
[28:46.800 --> 28:49.160]  When you have to replace as many bulbs as we do,
[28:49.160 --> 28:50.680]  every couple of hours helps.
[28:50.680 --> 28:52.880]  When you have to keep everything cool
[28:52.880 --> 28:54.560]  with as much as cooling as we're using,
[28:54.560 --> 28:58.040]  every hour on the bulbs and ballast helps
[28:58.040 --> 28:58.880]  is what I'm saying.
[28:58.880 --> 28:59.980]  So we experiment.
[28:59.980 --> 29:01.340]  Sometimes it's four hours of darkness.
[29:01.340 --> 29:02.220]  Sometimes it's five.
[29:02.220 --> 29:04.200]  We're just seeing what works best for us.
[29:04.200 --> 29:06.160]  In my personal grows,
[29:06.160 --> 29:09.760]  I do like to use the 18-6.
[29:09.760 --> 29:12.000]  For mother plants, for my personal mother plants,
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.880]  I do use the 20 hour on and four hour off cycle.
[29:15.880 --> 29:17.280]  And for all of my clones,
[29:17.280 --> 29:18.880]  the clones go 24 hours on.
[29:18.880 --> 29:20.840]  So that's my personal setup there.
[29:20.840 --> 29:21.920]  One thing I've noticed,
[29:21.920 --> 29:22.760]  and I might've mentioned this,
[29:22.760 --> 29:24.920]  I teased on this just a little bit ago.
[29:24.920 --> 29:26.660]  If you have a long veg time,
[29:26.660 --> 29:28.980]  the people that go 24 hours of veg,
[29:28.980 --> 29:30.740]  and they never turn the lights off,
[29:30.740 --> 29:32.740]  when you put the plants into flower,
[29:32.740 --> 29:36.200]  those plants flower just a little bit more quickly.
[29:36.200 --> 29:37.160]  Most of the time,
[29:37.160 --> 29:40.200]  it'll take 10 to 14 days to see flowers turning.
[29:40.200 --> 29:42.080]  If you just went from 24,
[29:42.080 --> 29:43.920]  and then you went to 12, 12,
[29:43.920 --> 29:46.240]  you might see that change happen in seven to 10 days
[29:46.240 --> 29:47.600]  instead of 10 to 14.
[29:47.600 --> 29:49.360]  That's one thing I have noticed.
[29:49.360 --> 29:51.760]  I wouldn't do the 24 in veg
[29:51.760 --> 29:54.280]  or the 20 on and four off in veg,
[29:54.280 --> 29:55.760]  unless you were only gonna veg
[29:55.760 --> 29:57.720]  little plants for a little while.
[29:57.720 --> 29:59.600]  If they're gonna get bigger and start branching out,
[29:59.600 --> 30:00.840]  you wanna give them some nighttime,
[30:00.840 --> 30:02.160]  let those hormones move around,
[30:02.160 --> 30:03.360]  let the plants get some rest,
[30:03.360 --> 30:05.080]  let your equipment get some rest.
[30:05.080 --> 30:06.960]  Just think about how long you wanna veg them.
[30:06.960 --> 30:07.920]  If they're gonna be little,
[30:07.920 --> 30:09.420]  you can do 24 on.
[30:09.420 --> 30:10.440]  And then when you flip them,
[30:10.440 --> 30:12.920]  they will really blast off.
[30:12.920 --> 30:13.840]  All right, podcast world,
[30:13.840 --> 30:15.920]  I hope I taught you a little bit about veg times.
[30:15.920 --> 30:17.240]  I hope I helped you choose
[30:17.240 --> 30:19.360]  how long you wanna put your lights on.
[30:19.360 --> 30:21.480]  If you're trying to get something to come out of flower
[30:22.200 --> 30:23.040]  and go back to veg,
[30:23.040 --> 30:25.760]  it's gotta be on for 24 hours or it's not gonna go back.
[30:25.760 --> 30:27.560]  I did a whole episode about re-vegging plants.
[30:27.560 --> 30:28.880]  So if that's what you're trying to do,
[30:28.880 --> 30:30.640]  go search for that one.
[30:30.640 --> 30:33.560]  Let's see, what else did I want to mention?
[30:33.560 --> 30:35.800]  Oh, here's something I wanted to talk about.
[30:35.800 --> 30:38.720]  I wanna know if you tip your bud tenders.
[30:38.720 --> 30:41.180]  If you shop at a medical marijuana dispensary,
[30:41.180 --> 30:44.120]  if you shop at a recreational cannabis dispensary,
[30:44.120 --> 30:46.000]  I wanna know if you tip your bud tenders.
[30:46.000 --> 30:48.100]  How do you feel about tipping a bud tender?
[30:48.100 --> 30:50.040]  I'm curious, send me an email,
[30:50.040 --> 30:51.880]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com.

[31:01.240 --> 31:03.040]  I'd love to get you on a podcast
[31:03.040 --> 31:05.440]  and we can talk about if you should and should not
[31:05.440 --> 31:07.760]  and how you should and should not tip a bud tender.
[31:07.760 --> 31:09.160]  And maybe we can also talk about
[31:09.160 --> 31:11.220]  some dispensary etiquette while you're here.
