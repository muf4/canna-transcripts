[00:01.470 --> 00:24.460]  It's time for episode number 156 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:24.460 --> 00:28.860]  news, education, and conversation. That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a
[00:28.860 --> 00:32.740]  professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:32.740 --> 00:36.900]  activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis, this,
[00:36.900 --> 00:41.980]  my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want
[00:41.980 --> 00:45.660]  to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout
[00:45.660 --> 00:49.820]  out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my show.
[00:49.820 --> 00:55.500]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, I had to
[00:55.500 --> 00:59.980]  pull myself away from Narcos season two to come record a podcast. Shout out to my friend
[00:59.980 --> 01:05.860]  that threw down the Netflix password for me. Now I got me a fresh Netflix account there,
[01:05.860 --> 01:10.980]  catching up on some Narcos. Can't get enough. Shout out to good old Pablo Escobar. Ladies
[01:10.980 --> 01:14.940]  and gentlemen, in this episode, I am going to talk about a recent, a cease and desist
[01:14.940 --> 01:20.700]  letter that was sent to all of the cannabis social lounges in Colorado Springs. But before
[01:20.700 --> 01:25.060]  we get to that, I want to answer some emails that were sent to us by some friends. Let's
[01:25.060 --> 01:29.900]  just get right to that part. This one came to the Grow From Your Heart Facebook page.
[01:29.900 --> 01:33.380]  And this one, I don't know if she wants me to say her name on the air, but I am going
[01:33.380 --> 01:37.540]  to read her message. It goes like this. Do you have any opinion on trimming machines?
[01:37.540 --> 01:41.420]  We are home growers, so we are looking for something small like the Triminator Mini Dry
[01:41.420 --> 01:46.420]  Trimmer or the smaller Trim Pal. But lots of folks are against trimming machines, so
[01:46.420 --> 01:51.940]  I just thought I would ask your expert opinion. Thanks for all the info you share. I love
[01:51.940 --> 01:55.380]  your show. Hey, thanks for listening to the podcast. I appreciate it when people send
[01:55.380 --> 01:58.940]  me messages, and I love it when people tell me that they love the show. It makes it all
[01:58.940 --> 02:06.540]  worth it. Big shout out. I appreciate that. So let's talk about trim machines. You're
[02:06.540 --> 02:10.620]  not going to like my answer, but there is not a trim machine that I like. I really,
[02:10.620 --> 02:15.340]  I'm a fan of hand trimmed cannabis. I think connoisseur grade cannabis should be trimmed
[02:15.340 --> 02:20.380]  by hand. If you're growing a whole bunch, if you've got a large outdoor, I might see
[02:20.380 --> 02:25.340]  you using a trim machine. But honestly, I can tell the difference between hand trimmed
[02:25.340 --> 02:30.620]  and machine trimmed cannabis. And there's nothing like hand trimmed cannabis. Why? This
[02:30.620 --> 02:34.860]  is my opinion. Why grow your plants? You're going to have them for what, nine weeks in
[02:34.860 --> 02:39.380]  flower and then probably four to six weeks, maybe eight weeks in veg, maybe longer depending
[02:39.380 --> 02:44.220]  on how you do things. So that's a lot of weeks. That's 13 weeks, 14, 15, 16 weeks. You've
[02:44.220 --> 02:48.420]  got these plants, right? Then you're going to cut them down. Why not take the time to
[02:48.420 --> 02:52.740]  trim them by hand and love them? And I know it's tedious and it kind of sucks sometimes,
[02:52.740 --> 02:59.480]  but it's so worth it in my opinion. And then my big thing is when you use a machine to
[02:59.480 --> 03:05.360]  trim your cannabis, it turns that trim into like a mulch and it just makes it, it cuts
[03:05.360 --> 03:09.600]  it at too many different angles, too many different times. And it makes it, it's basically
[03:09.600 --> 03:13.400]  a mulch. Like when you mow the lawn and you've got that bag of clippings and it stinks real
[03:13.400 --> 03:17.840]  funky, you have kind of mulched up all of your cannabis leaves and they're releasing
[03:17.840 --> 03:22.480]  too much moisture. And it's starting to, there's a reaction that's happening in there because
[03:22.480 --> 03:26.140]  it's cut so many times and it's stacked inside of there. And you know how the grass stinks
[03:26.140 --> 03:30.300]  real bad? Well, your trim will start to do that also. A lot of times when you're getting
[03:30.300 --> 03:35.840]  shitty hash from the dispensary, it was possibly made, I can't guarantee it, but it was possibly
[03:35.840 --> 03:42.160]  made by material that came from the trim machine. When I helped my buddy Kevin get started making
[03:42.160 --> 03:47.160]  his little hash company, I was a grower, he was an extract guy. I was giving him material.
[03:47.160 --> 03:51.260]  I used a trim machine. I used the kind that looks like a giant salad bowl and it's got
[03:51.260 --> 03:55.480]  the grill in the middle of it and you put the top on it and you spin it. That worked.
[03:55.480 --> 04:00.000]  It trimmed the shit out of some of my buds. Some of my buds had just mangled. I grew some
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.020]  cush that was like rocks. It trimmed that okay. I had some lemon skunk that had some
[04:04.020 --> 04:08.900]  fingery buds. It just cut the shit out of those. They didn't like that at all. So, where
[04:08.900 --> 04:14.200]  I'm getting is I gave the trim from that to my buddy Kev bro and he ran and made hash
[04:14.200 --> 04:18.640]  out of it and the hash was terrible and we couldn't figure out why. And we took it to
[04:18.640 --> 04:21.880]  Denver with us one time on a trip and we showed a friend and my buddy's like, dude, did you
[04:21.880 --> 04:26.480]  use a trim machine to make this hash? And he called us out right away. He knew. And
[04:26.480 --> 04:32.360]  so it made green shitty hash. So that's one major reason why I don't like a trim machine.
[04:32.360 --> 04:35.200]  I think it should be trimmed by hand. You can trim it by hand and then you can use all
[04:35.200 --> 04:39.880]  of your fine trim to actually make some product out of. You can make concentrates, you can
[04:39.880 --> 04:43.480]  make edibles, you can do whatever you want with it. But if you use a machine, it's pretty
[04:43.480 --> 04:47.920]  much wasted. And like I said before, if you're going to put that much time into growing it
[04:47.920 --> 04:51.560]  and to drying it and curing it, why not sit around the table with whoever's going to smoke
[04:51.560 --> 04:56.520]  it with you? You said we are growers. I'm assuming there's you and probably a spouse
[04:56.520 --> 05:00.720]  or a partner or whatever you call it these days. And maybe a couple of friends, maybe
[05:00.720 --> 05:04.320]  a roommate or something. You guys should all sit around the table and trim it up, talk,
[05:04.320 --> 05:07.200]  have a good time, experience that shit. You probably have, but I'm saying that's what
[05:07.200 --> 05:11.960]  should happen in my opinion. I understand it gets overwhelming. There are a lot of great
[05:11.960 --> 05:15.400]  trim machines, but there's not one that I can recommend because I stay away from them
[05:15.400 --> 05:21.000]  and I hire humans to trim. So honestly, that's my a hundred percent honest guidance on trim
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.740]  machines. If anybody out there has a trim machine that they think trims to the quality
[05:25.740 --> 05:31.360]  of a hand trimmer of a person, send me a message, send me a video. I am very open. I want to
[05:31.360 --> 05:34.720]  know about these things. There's shit that I don't know. Enlighten me. I'd like to be
[05:34.720 --> 05:38.120]  on the knowledge team. So let me know. And then I can share that information with the
[05:38.120 --> 05:41.120]  listeners. Let me know what you think about trim machines. If you've got one that can
[05:41.120 --> 05:45.440]  compete with my quality trim, uh, grow from your heart at hotmail.com. All right. That's
[05:45.440 --> 05:52.840]  the first email. Let's get to another email. This guy sent me like a multiple multi-choice
[05:52.840 --> 05:58.720]  email and it won't open, but I'll make it open, but it won't do it. Hello email. All
[05:58.720 --> 06:03.800]  right, it's broken. All right, here we go. This one just says podcast topic, the freedom
[06:03.800 --> 06:09.040]  of strains. How do you feel about trading? Is it legal to ship cuttings to legal States
[06:09.040 --> 06:15.000]  due to low THC content? Uh, so how do I feel about trading strains? Uh, so like if you've
[06:15.000 --> 06:20.720]  got a clone and I've got a clone and I want what you've gotten vice versa, like baseball
[06:20.720 --> 06:25.720]  cards. Yes. I love trading strains. Uh, I've, I've gotten some of my best strains by trading
[06:25.720 --> 06:29.760]  stuff before. Uh, it's like having a good baseball card. You know what I mean? That
[06:29.760 --> 06:33.920]  right. That specific cut could be like that. Uh, I'm not a baseball guy, but I listened
[06:33.920 --> 06:37.120]  to enough Greg proofs to know that like a Mickey Mantle card would be worth some shit,
[06:37.120 --> 06:41.080]  you know, or if I had a central page baseball card, I could probably trade that for a bunch
[06:41.080 --> 06:44.280]  of other cards. So if I've got that one good cut, like back in the day, if you had girl
[06:44.280 --> 06:49.060]  scout cookies around here, I could trade my girl scout cookies forum cut for almost any
[06:49.060 --> 06:54.760]  cut that anybody had. Uh, the gorilla glue is very similar. My grateful dog. I will not
[06:54.760 --> 06:59.040]  let that out to people. People have offered me ridiculous trades for my mother plant of
[06:59.040 --> 07:03.920]  my grateful dog. I won't let it go. However. Uh, so yeah, I totally love the freedom of
[07:03.920 --> 07:09.160]  trading strains. Um, you should give strains away. Also, there's nothing wrong with that.
[07:09.160 --> 07:12.800]  I give people clones. I had a friend started grow recently. I gave them shit tons of clones
[07:12.800 --> 07:17.520]  just to get them started. Uh, that's, you should give away and trade clones and seeds.
[07:17.520 --> 07:21.560]  Uh, that should happen if you've got a pack of seeds, if you've got 20 seeds and you only
[07:21.560 --> 07:25.560]  want to run 10 and your buddy's got 10 seeds of something else, trade, do it, get it on.
[07:25.560 --> 07:30.020]  I think that's awesome. So then he also said, is it legal to ship cuttings to legal States
[07:30.020 --> 07:35.700]  due to low THC content? You know what? I cannot speak on shipping. I do not know anything
[07:35.700 --> 07:39.180]  about shipping. I don't know the legalities of that. I honestly avoid shipping. I don't
[07:39.180 --> 07:44.540]  like to put anything in the mail. Uh, I'm kind of a paranoid old hippie on that part.
[07:44.540 --> 07:49.460]  So I don't really put anything in the mail unless it's absolutely necessary. So I can't
[07:49.460 --> 07:54.740]  speak too much on that. Uh, low THC content, I guess if you're shipping hemp plants from
[07:54.740 --> 07:59.860]  one legal state to another, that's probably okay. But isn't the shipping system, isn't
[07:59.860 --> 08:03.340]  that owned by the government? Isn't that federal? So you're probably fucking up somehow.
[08:03.340 --> 08:08.900]  I would avoid that. Then your question continues with, uh, people slash clubs, buying and renaming
[08:08.900 --> 08:13.940]  genetics, selling breeding rights, et cetera. So let me touch on that one. People and clubs
[08:13.940 --> 08:19.620]  buying and renaming genetics. That sucks. Uh, I really hate it when I give somebody
[08:19.620 --> 08:23.540]  a clone and they grow that clone. And then I know that they harvested. And then like
[08:23.540 --> 08:27.520]  a little while later, they've got a bag of something that smells exactly like the clone
[08:27.520 --> 08:30.920]  that I gave them. Tastes just like it looks just like it. And they're calling it some
[08:30.920 --> 08:34.320]  different shit because they want to take some credit for it or they want to make some extra
[08:34.320 --> 08:40.240]  money off of it by calling it something different. That is frustrating shit right there. Uh,
[08:40.240 --> 08:45.580]  call it what it is or the clubs will do it. Also the clubs, the somebody else will name
[08:45.580 --> 08:50.820]  something and then we have medical marijuana here in Colorado and some people really like
[08:50.820 --> 08:57.360]  specific strains. Some people really dislike other strains. And if you know that I'm going
[08:57.400 --> 09:01.760]  to say sour diesel, if sour diesel works well for you medicinally, you want to go get
[09:01.760 --> 09:05.840]  sour diesel. And if somebody just named some shit on the shelf, sour diesel, and you go
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.360]  spend your money on it and you get home and you smoke it and say, you've got Parkinson's
[09:10.360 --> 09:15.020]  and maybe sign, this is just hypothetical. You've got Parkinson's disease and sour diesel
[09:15.020 --> 09:19.960]  makes you quit trembling. So you just spent your hard earned money on this eighth or this
[09:19.960 --> 09:23.880]  quarter of medicine and you went home and you probably took all day to get that bowl
[09:23.880 --> 09:27.120]  packed and you finally smoked that fucker and you thought you were going to quit shaking.
[09:27.160 --> 09:30.360]  But guess what? Some asshole just mislabeled some weed because it would sell if it were
[09:30.360 --> 09:34.680]  called sour diesel and it's not going to do what you need properly for your medicinal
[09:34.680 --> 09:38.200]  effect. Then you just kind of wasted your money. Now you're disappointed. You probably
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.440]  wasted an Uber ride or a drive over to the dispensary. That shit sucks when people in
[09:43.440 --> 09:48.320]  clubs buy and rename genetics. That's not really cool. I think that everything needs
[09:48.320 --> 09:53.240]  to be left the proper name. I've seen it done. I try to speak out against it. I really dislike
[09:53.240 --> 09:58.960]  when extract companies take two different strains. Like right now I'm not going to call
[09:58.960 --> 10:02.960]  out the brand, but I'm going to talk about what I've got. I've got some curious George
[10:02.960 --> 10:08.320]  live resin in my hand. There's, I don't know of a stream called curious George, but there's
[10:08.320 --> 10:12.040]  some bananas and probably some gorilla glue or something. You know what I mean? So they
[10:12.040 --> 10:15.880]  just blended those two strains together and called it curious George, which I mean that's
[10:15.880 --> 10:19.640]  creative but they didn't breed that. They don't get to name, I guess they get to name
[10:19.640 --> 10:23.280]  that hash blend, but I think it would be better if they put like what turpex did on
[10:23.280 --> 10:30.040]  this container. Turpex printed taffy plus cascade nug run shatter. They didn't put an
[10:30.040 --> 10:36.180]  X to make you think it's crossed because if you put taffy times cascade, it makes it look
[10:36.180 --> 10:40.360]  like it's a hybrid of that because that's how a breeder would do it. So turpex does
[10:40.360 --> 10:45.580]  it taffy plus cascade. So I know straight up what two strains are in this hash blend.
[10:45.580 --> 10:50.020]  So maybe I've got a friend who, if she smokes too heavy of a sativa, she will have a panic
[10:50.020 --> 10:54.620]  attack right in front of you. She might piss her pants. She'll cry. She'll have to leave.
[10:54.620 --> 10:59.060]  It gets ridiculous if she smokes too much sativa that cascade in there, that would be
[10:59.060 --> 11:03.380]  too much for her head. So she knows straight up not to buy that. This other one, it doesn't
[11:03.380 --> 11:06.900]  say what's in there. So she doesn't know if she can even smoke that. So she probably wouldn't
[11:06.900 --> 11:12.420]  even waste her time buying it to tell you the truth. So yeah, it sucks when people rename
[11:12.420 --> 11:17.620]  stuff. I think that we need to keep the names true. I think that Budtenders or somebody
[11:17.620 --> 11:23.140]  in the dispensary, I think that the jar should say, and let's say maybe they have Lemon Jeffrey
[11:23.140 --> 11:26.820]  on the shelf. I think it should say Lemon Jeffrey, and then it should have a lab test
[11:26.820 --> 11:34.140]  of THC, CBD, maybe CBN, CBG, and THCA. Those need to be listed on there. And then underneath
[11:34.140 --> 11:38.620]  Lemon Jeffrey, it needs to tell you the genetics, Lemon Skunk and Golden Goat. It needs to let
[11:38.620 --> 11:42.900]  you know that that's the parents. I think that would be really helpful. And then it
[11:42.900 --> 11:48.820]  also should have the sativa or indica or hybrid marker, which is a whole nother conversation.
[11:48.820 --> 11:51.820]  Because everything's pretty much a hybrid these days, in my opinion, but you can have
[11:51.820 --> 11:55.900]  things that lean toward the indica and the sativa. So that's what I think about people
[11:55.900 --> 11:59.460]  renaming strains. I think it sucks. I think if I give you seeds or clones, you better
[11:59.460 --> 12:02.700]  call it that shit when you grow it just to keep it true. Because what if somebody breeds
[12:02.700 --> 12:06.500]  with it, then you're really fucking things up. You're really throwing off the family
[12:06.500 --> 12:10.620]  tree and we got to keep the cannabis family tree in line. That's part of our job. Myself
[12:10.620 --> 12:15.140]  as a breeder, that's really part of my job is to keep it true to where there's a history
[12:15.140 --> 12:18.940]  and a family tree so that we can look back when things get different. I don't know. I
[12:18.940 --> 12:22.380]  just think that's important. I like to be kind of a preservationist, I guess.
[12:22.380 --> 12:27.580]  So your email goes on to say, more casts on genetics and origins, please. I would like
[12:27.580 --> 12:32.480]  to talk a lot more about genetics and origins, but the only things I would really feel fully
[12:32.480 --> 12:36.540]  comfortable talking about would probably be strains that I bred because they're the
[12:36.540 --> 12:40.920]  only ones that I would know the true origin of. Because unfortunately, a lot of the popular
[12:40.920 --> 12:47.920]  cuts, there's a lot of lies and misinformation and bullshit based around the origins of those
[12:47.920 --> 12:52.000]  cuts. We know where Gorilla Glue came from because Josie Wales bred that and told us
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.280]  about it. We know where Golden Goat came from because Mr. Dank bred that and told us about
[12:56.280 --> 13:02.800]  it. But there are a lot of lies and rumors and untrue stories about things like Girl
[13:02.800 --> 13:07.740]  Scout Cookies and of course, the OG Kush. I mean, there are probably 20 different stories
[13:07.740 --> 13:12.120]  about OG Kush that I've heard. I don't want to talk about where I think it came from too
[13:12.120 --> 13:16.540]  much because I feel like I'm just diluting the true story since I really wasn't there
[13:16.540 --> 13:21.320]  and I don't know. So I'd love to talk more about origins. Maybe one day I'll talk about
[13:21.320 --> 13:25.760]  some of the strains that I created since I can tell you where they came from and I'm
[13:25.760 --> 13:31.720]  certain of those and I won't create any bullshit stories about it. So I made a note of that.
[13:31.720 --> 13:35.540]  I will talk about that in the future. All right, you guys, I want to thank you once
[13:35.540 --> 13:39.260]  again for sending me those messages. That message came from a dude called That Heavy
[13:39.260 --> 13:44.420]  Slim Guy on Instagram. Big shout out to That Heavy Slim Guy. I appreciate the message.

[14:16.720 --> 14:19.600]  that I'm hitting my target audience. It lets me know I'm talking about something you guys
[14:19.600 --> 14:24.200]  want to hear about. It always gives me good content. I appreciate that. Thank you guys.
[14:24.200 --> 14:29.360]  Now, at the start of the show, I did say I was going to talk about the cannabis clubs
[14:29.360 --> 14:34.160]  in Colorado Springs receiving a cease and desist letter. I'm pulling up a website now.
[14:34.160 --> 14:39.440]  I'm pulling up the Denver Post website. This article comes from the Colorado Springs Gazette.
[14:39.440 --> 14:45.440]  They do not give an author name. We will get into the article. I like to give credit, but
[14:45.440 --> 14:48.840]  there's no one to give credit here besides the Denver Post and the Springs Gazette. The
[14:48.840 --> 14:54.040]  article goes like this. Nine Colorado Springs cannabis consumption clubs received cease
[14:54.040 --> 14:59.020]  and desist letters from the city clerk's office last week in the first crackdown under a ban
[14:59.020 --> 15:05.040]  on the clubs enacted by the city council on March 22nd. The club sprang up after Amendment
[15:05.040 --> 15:11.480]  64 was passed in 2012, legalizing adult sales and use of recreational marijuana, but banning
[15:11.480 --> 15:17.280]  public consumption. The clubs gave people a place to use cannabis and socialize in private.
[15:17.280 --> 15:21.680]  Colorado Springs outlawed sales of recreational marijuana in the city, but the clubs got around
[15:21.680 --> 15:26.240]  the ban by providing pot to their patrons for a reimbursement model. They could either
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.240]  trade cannabis for membership or sign affidavits saying the club was growing the customers
[15:31.240 --> 15:36.000]  legally allowed six marijuana plants for them. All right, now let me back up and talk about
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.600]  a couple of things on here. Colorado Springs outlawed sales of recreational marijuana in
[15:40.600 --> 15:44.840]  the city of Colorado Springs. When we did pass recreational marijuana, counties were
[15:44.840 --> 15:49.400]  allowed counties and cities were allowed to decide if they wanted recreational marijuana
[15:49.400 --> 15:54.940]  dispensaries in their county or not. And a lot of places said no. Denver has a lot of
[15:54.940 --> 15:59.720]  recreational marijuana available. Pueblo has recreational cannabis available. Colorado
[15:59.720 --> 16:03.880]  Springs is right in the middle and they banned it. So the way that the city got around it
[16:03.880 --> 16:07.540]  or the way that people got around it was by opening up these cannabis clubs and working
[16:07.540 --> 16:12.320]  on what they called here the reimbursement model, which means you can sign a paper that
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.000]  says you're a member, you probably pay a cover charge, then you can walk into that
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.240]  club and if they've got some cannabis and you want to smoke it, they won't sell it to
[16:20.240 --> 16:24.360]  you. They'll give it to you, but you've got to reimburse them for the electricity that
[16:24.360 --> 16:28.360]  they spent and the time that somebody spent trimming it and whatever they feel the product
[16:28.360 --> 16:33.600]  is worth, you've got to reimburse them. The way that they made that legal was these people
[16:33.600 --> 16:38.800]  would sign over their legal plant count. So in Colorado, when you get a medical marijuana
[16:38.800 --> 16:45.040]  card, you are allowed six plants. You can pay a larger fee or you can talk to your doctor
[16:45.040 --> 16:49.200]  and he may give you what's called an elevated plant count where you can grow more plants.
[16:49.200 --> 16:55.220]  They will offer up to 99 plants in some cases, but you'll take your medical marijuana paperwork
[16:55.220 --> 17:00.200]  and there's a spot where you sign your provider and you will make whoever runs this cannabis
[17:00.200 --> 17:07.100]  club would now become your provider. And now that place is legally pseudo kind of allowed
[17:07.100 --> 17:12.180]  to grow your six plants for you. And when you go there, you walk in and you're already
[17:12.180 --> 17:15.900]  a member there, they're growing your plants. So you're able to consume products that are
[17:15.900 --> 17:20.460]  there on site. This is how it was. It's no longer like this since they came and made
[17:20.460 --> 17:24.320]  these new rules and sent this cease and desist letter, but this is how it used to work.
[17:24.320 --> 17:27.820]  So I'm going to continue with the article. It says, although the city officials view
[17:27.820 --> 17:32.820]  such actions as de facto sales, the practice has continued. The ban passed in March, however,
[17:32.820 --> 17:39.300]  says the clubs cannot sell, trade, give, distribute, or allow the transfer of marijuana.
[17:39.300 --> 17:45.180]  So they're technically not allowed to be reimbursed or sell or trade cannabis in there. They cannot
[17:45.180 --> 17:50.500]  give cannabis away, which is kind of weird because what's a cannabis social club without
[17:50.500 --> 17:55.060]  cannabis. Um, it doesn't say that we can't consume it in there right now, but that was
[17:55.060 --> 17:58.580]  part of what they, uh, part of the new rules was we couldn't consume in there. So I'll
[17:58.580 --> 18:02.700]  continue with the article. It says the band gave clubs that existed before September 23rd,
[18:02.700 --> 18:07.100]  2015, eight years to phase out their businesses and effort to help the owners protect their
[18:07.100 --> 18:11.980]  investment. But under the law, every owner had to submit a consumption club application
[18:11.980 --> 18:18.220]  and a $200 fee by April 29th to get a one year renewable license for $90 plus registration
[18:18.220 --> 18:23.900]  fees. Only five clubs applied by the deadline. One was approved to or under consideration
[18:23.900 --> 18:28.700]  and two were denied the denied clubs along with seven other identified clubs that did
[18:28.700 --> 18:33.740]  not apply for licensing have been ordered to close because they are not licensed as
[18:33.740 --> 18:38.980]  required. Now guys, I talk about this a lot. Every time I talk about cannabis consumption
[18:38.980 --> 18:42.780]  clubs, we talk about the can of Canyon or the dab lounge. I talk about this all the
[18:42.780 --> 18:48.100]  time when you are writing legislation for your area, if your state or your locality
[18:48.100 --> 18:52.340]  is inventing and writing and creating the laws for medical or recreational cannabis
[18:52.340 --> 18:57.940]  in your area or any type of cannabis use in your area, please include some type of
[18:57.940 --> 19:02.500]  safe smoking area. You need a consumption club. You need a place where adults can go
[19:02.500 --> 19:07.460]  and congregate and consume cannabis safely. Like adults. There are people that come from
[19:07.460 --> 19:12.700]  all over the world to Colorado. Anybody 21 and over can drive to Denver or Pueblo and
[19:12.700 --> 19:17.220]  they can show an ID and if they've got some money, they can buy some cannabis. Now, once
[19:17.220 --> 19:21.680]  they leave that dispensary, there's nowhere safe for them to consume that you can't smoke
[19:21.680 --> 19:26.440]  in your car because you'll get a DUI. Oh, excuse me. I'm coughing. You can't smoke at
[19:26.440 --> 19:30.280]  the park because that is illegal. You can't roll up a joint and walk down the street and
[19:30.280 --> 19:34.360]  safely smoke in Colorado. That is frowned upon. That's not what we did here. So there's
[19:34.360 --> 19:38.960]  nowhere practically or practical or safe to smoke the cannabis you just bought at the
[19:38.960 --> 19:42.760]  dispenser. You can go to your hotel and a lot of hotels make you sign a paper when you
[19:42.760 --> 19:49.240]  check in and it says that they will charge you $250 to $500 for cleaning your room. If
[19:49.240 --> 19:52.720]  you smoke cannabis in there because they think you're going to fuck that room up $250
[19:52.720 --> 19:58.120]  to $500 worth of stank. You better have some good weed if it costs $500 to get the smell
[19:58.120 --> 20:02.000]  out of that hotel room. So there's nowhere practical to smoke. We need these consumption
[20:02.000 --> 20:05.640]  places you guys. So when you're writing this legislation and writing the rules, please
[20:05.640 --> 20:08.760]  be sure to include that because that's where we screwed up here in Colorado. We would have
[20:08.760 --> 20:13.600]  it pretty well. Pretty good if we didn't, uh, if we didn't skip that part. Now, what
[20:13.600 --> 20:17.420]  really sucks you guys is, uh, I'm passionate about this because a couple of my friends
[20:17.420 --> 20:21.780]  own these businesses, but I feel for every owner, how are my friends that were promised
[20:21.780 --> 20:26.820]  eight years to continue doing business, to recoup their assets or recoup their investments?
[20:26.820 --> 20:30.500]  How, how are they expected to pay their bills now that they're not allowed to work on the
[20:30.500 --> 20:34.820]  business model that they have designed and been operating on? They're not allowed to
[20:34.820 --> 20:38.300]  reimburse for cannabis. They're not allowed to give it away. They're not allowed to trade
[20:38.300 --> 20:43.580]  it. There's no transaction involved for cannabis, which honestly was a large portion of these
[20:43.580 --> 20:47.280]  people's revenue. Now, how are they going to pay the rent? As I'm recording, the first
[20:47.280 --> 20:51.420]  is creeping up on us and I know hopefully these businesses have more than one month
[20:51.420 --> 20:55.860]  of finances put aside, but you never know. This is the cannabis industry. They have to
[20:55.860 --> 21:00.300]  buy products. They have to pay vendors. They have to keep the lights on. Apparently some
[21:00.300 --> 21:03.980]  of them are growing products somewhere, which costs money. You have to pay to grow. You
[21:03.980 --> 21:08.220]  have to pay trimmers. You have to pay electricity. Soil costs money. Everything costs money when
[21:08.220 --> 21:13.660]  you're doing business. Making money costs a shit ton of money. Money is expensive. How
[21:13.660 --> 21:18.720]  are these folks? How are my friends? How is our community going to pay their rent now
[21:18.720 --> 21:22.500]  that they are not allowed to function under their business plan? I do not find it fair.
[21:22.500 --> 21:26.660]  I hope that we can do something about this. There wasn't, I would rally you guys for a
[21:26.660 --> 21:30.140]  city council meeting, but it's already happened. If you were in Colorado Springs, please go
[21:30.140 --> 21:33.700]  to the city council meetings and show support for the cannabis clubs. There's something
[21:33.700 --> 21:37.580]  that we really need. We're allowed to have bars on every other corner where people can
[21:37.580 --> 21:41.980]  go and drink whiskey and beer all day and get shitted and cause problems, but we're
[21:41.980 --> 21:46.460]  not allowed to have a place where people can go consume some cannabis peacefully. I don't
[21:46.460 --> 21:51.720]  find it to be fair. The Colorado model says let's regulate cannabis like alcohol. So let's
[21:51.720 --> 21:56.060]  do that. Shit. If we're going to do that, how about when we're at a baseball game or
[21:56.060 --> 22:00.100]  a football game or a basketball game? Why don't we have a medical marijuana smoking
[22:00.100 --> 22:05.060]  section or a recreational marijuana smoking section right next to the smoking section?
[22:05.060 --> 22:10.140]  If we're going to regulate like alcohol, let's step up and do it correctly. All right, you
[22:10.140 --> 22:14.940]  guys, I've been renting for a long time. I really hope that you show some support for
[22:14.940 --> 22:18.300]  these cannabis clubs. And I want to give a huge shout out to all of the cannabis club
[22:18.300 --> 22:23.140]  owners and proprietors and everybody who works with the clubs to make them happen. I appreciate
[22:23.140 --> 22:28.060]  you and I respect you and shout out. I hope that you are able to continue doing business
[22:28.060 --> 22:31.860]  and I hope you guys all survive. I know most of you are probably, you have family, so you
[22:31.860 --> 22:35.980]  got at least got a damn dog and a house to take care of. That shit's expensive. I hope
[22:35.980 --> 22:40.460]  you find a means to do it. I hope it all works out for you. Okay, I want to wrap up the podcast
[22:40.460 --> 22:45.060]  with another message. This one comes from year of the gorilla on Instagram. Year of
[22:45.060 --> 22:49.420]  the gorilla was the winner of the hashtag mullet challenge. I don't know if anybody
[22:49.420 --> 22:52.980]  listened to that episode, but I did the mullet challenge. You had to find somebody in their
[22:52.980 --> 22:57.620]  pajamas at a Walmart with a mullet and snap a picture and send it to me. This dude followed
[22:57.620 --> 23:01.260]  all of the instructions. He meets the criteria. Shout out to year of the gorilla. You've
[23:01.260 --> 23:04.220]  got some stickers coming your way. By the time this episode comes out, the stickers
[23:04.220 --> 23:08.540]  will be in the mail, the checks in the mail, buddy. So he also sent me a message. It says,
[23:08.540 --> 23:12.820]  Hey Rasta Jeff, I was wondering if you have any favorite pest management routines like
[23:12.820 --> 23:17.260]  products you use and applications and how often I know having a clean grow and proper
[23:17.260 --> 23:22.980]  environmental control play a key role in keeping things healthy and happy. Also, maybe what
[23:22.980 --> 23:28.420]  would you do if an outbreak occurs and how to stay positive and overcome challenges in
[23:28.420 --> 23:34.180]  the grow? Now, the first part of that talking about pest management routines and the products
[23:34.180 --> 23:38.940]  that I use, that'll be another episode. I am writing an episode. I've got notes for
[23:38.940 --> 23:41.940]  it. I've got a notebook filled with notes. You guys, a lot of people probably wouldn't
[23:41.940 --> 23:45.700]  believe how many notes I've got and how many half shows I've got. I've got a lot of stuff
[23:45.700 --> 23:51.660]  prepared, but I'm doing an episode on how to identify problems and how to treat for
[23:51.660 --> 23:56.780]  problems and how to prevent problems on the list of things that we're going to talk about.
[23:56.780 --> 24:01.220]  I've got spider mites, white flies, fungus gnats, thrips. So that's just the top of the
[24:01.220 --> 24:05.500]  list. We're going to talk about how to identify those on your plants. We'll talk about all
[24:05.500 --> 24:10.900]  the pest management stuff, but what I want to get to this part of this message is how
[24:10.900 --> 24:16.980]  do you also maybe what to do if an outbreak occurs and how to stay positive and overcome
[24:16.980 --> 24:20.980]  challenges in your grow because that is super important. I see a lot of people have a problem
[24:21.020 --> 24:25.380]  at the beginning of the grow, just not too far in and they get completely frustrated
[24:25.380 --> 24:29.100]  and they feel defeated from the very beginning and it feels like they're fighting an uphill
[24:29.100 --> 24:34.580]  battle. Cannabis is a plant that wants to survive. Cannabis is hard to kill. You have
[24:34.580 --> 24:40.500]  to almost try to kill cannabis. So if you get a problem, you have to first identify
[24:40.500 --> 24:45.540]  the problem, right? That's what you have to do. Then you have to figure out how to solve
[24:45.540 --> 24:50.860]  that problem. Then you have to put that plan into action and solve your problem. And then
[24:50.860 --> 24:55.500]  your problem will be solved. And then if you do it right, you have a stronger sense
[24:55.500 --> 25:01.140]  of pride because you overcame something. Anybody can put some plants in some soil, pour some
[25:01.140 --> 25:04.620]  nutrients and some water on them, put them under some lights and let them grow for nine
[25:04.620 --> 25:10.700]  or 12 weeks and produce some cannabis. It's when you have a problem that you had to overcome
[25:10.700 --> 25:14.860]  is when it's really, it makes it more fun for a guy like myself, I guess. Maybe that's
[25:14.860 --> 25:19.960]  how I stay positive. I enjoy a challenge. I don't like the mundane, boring life at all.
[25:20.060 --> 25:25.560]  That's why I do what I do. That's why I live the way that I live. I honestly think that
[25:25.560 --> 25:30.840]  causing some problems and screwing up makes you a better grower. You have to, I mean,
[25:30.840 --> 25:35.540]  you didn't learn how to walk until you fell down a few times. And then you didn't learn
[25:35.540 --> 25:39.280]  how to run until you were good at walking. And then you fucked up running a few times
[25:39.280 --> 25:44.200]  and scraped up your knees. So you have to kind of make some mistakes and overcome them.
[25:44.200 --> 25:47.260]  That's how I stay positive. I know that I'm learning something. I know that there's something
[25:47.260 --> 25:52.340]  going to come out of that mistake that I made. So that's how I stay positive. And also
[25:52.340 --> 25:57.340]  man, you're growing cannabis. You can't get too upset about what you did because you're
[25:57.340 --> 26:02.980]  growing cannabis. If you've got a problem, so maybe you got spider mites, that happens.
[26:02.980 --> 26:07.540]  First you have to accept it because shit happens and you made a mistake somewhere. Maybe there's
[26:07.540 --> 26:10.580]  a crack in the wall that spider mites climbed through. It might not even really be something
[26:10.580 --> 26:15.180]  you could have thought about or could have done anything about. You got mites. Okay.
[26:15.180 --> 26:20.060]  Accept it. Get on the internet. Text Ross to Jeff. Do whatever you got to do. Listen
[26:20.060 --> 26:23.900]  to a podcast to figure out how to get rid of those spider mites. If you're in whatever
[26:23.900 --> 26:28.940]  week, don't panic. Whatever week you're in, don't panic. There's a solution. At worst
[26:28.940 --> 26:32.900]  case scenario, harvest. Flush your plants and harvest them. Just flush them out more
[26:32.900 --> 26:36.300]  quickly than those bugs can eat them. Harvest it and get what you can out of the crop. You're
[26:36.300 --> 26:41.780]  going to get something even if it's just experience. You're going to get something. So find what
[26:41.780 --> 26:46.540]  you've got, identify it, then take the steps to get rid of it and then clean up the grow
[26:46.540 --> 26:52.520]  room and go back at it harder than ever before. And next time when you see the very warning
[26:52.520 --> 26:56.020]  of spider mites in that room, you're going to know exactly what to do. You're going to
[26:56.020 --> 27:00.060]  identify it more quickly. You're just going to be better at it. I know that part of me
[27:00.060 --> 27:04.560]  will always know that I'm bigger than every bug and I can find some sort of thing to destroy
[27:04.560 --> 27:08.460]  any insect that gets into my room. And I've got books that can show me how to get rid
[27:08.460 --> 27:13.420]  of any sort of mold or anything. So I'm just confident that I can take down any problem
[27:13.420 --> 27:16.860]  that I'm given in a grow room. I've had some crazy shit happen in grow rooms before. I've
[27:16.860 --> 27:22.920]  had fans fall and chop up plants and lights have come undone and I've ran commercial grows.
[27:22.920 --> 27:28.080]  There's a lot of stuff that can go wrong. I've had PVC pipes with, oh, I forgot how
[27:28.080 --> 27:31.300]  many gallons per minute this pump used to push, but way too many gallons of water. This
[27:31.300 --> 27:35.620]  PVC pipe exploded, water went everywhere. So I've had a lot of crazy shit happen in
[27:35.620 --> 27:39.460]  a grow room. You just got to smile. You got to put some reggae music on, got to turn up
[27:39.460 --> 27:42.980]  the headphones. You got to laugh, maybe go take a couple dabs and just get in there and
[27:42.980 --> 27:46.100]  solve the problem. It's just like anything else in life, anything else in life. Shit's
[27:46.100 --> 27:51.340]  going to happen all the time. Every day. Life would be way too easy if shit went right all
[27:51.340 --> 27:56.440]  the time. So I expect problems in a grow room. Actually, when I ran the big grow and I was
[27:56.440 --> 27:59.940]  training new people, they would always say, so what's the first thing you got to do when
[27:59.940 --> 28:03.380]  you get here? And I would always say, find the surprise. They'd be like, what do you
[28:03.380 --> 28:06.500]  mean? I'd be like, well, that's a big ass girl. We've got a hundred and something lights.
[28:06.500 --> 28:11.780]  We've got like 50 fans. There's a bunch of pumps. There's a bunch of PVC. So we get to
[28:11.780 --> 28:15.660]  find what fucked up overnight while we were gone. Cause it's been like 12 hours since
[28:15.660 --> 28:19.380]  we've been here. And so everybody just laughed at first and they'd really realize like, oh
[28:19.380 --> 28:23.060]  yeah, every day when we get in here, there's some weird shit that we have to find and we
[28:23.060 --> 28:28.060]  have to repair or handle before we can even go about normal business. So it's up to you.
[28:28.060 --> 28:33.060]  You can either, uh, you can either laugh it off and just have a good time and clean
[28:33.060 --> 28:37.100]  it up, move on, do whatever you got to do, or you can have a stroke about it and be pissed
[28:37.100 --> 28:41.340]  off all day. That's up to you. But I choose to just have a good time. Remember that growing
[28:41.340 --> 28:46.380]  cannabis, there's no need to really get too mad about too much. All right. So thanks for
[28:46.380 --> 28:50.660]  that message. I appreciate that. Um, that really, I hope I was a little bit inspiring
[28:50.660 --> 28:54.380]  and I hope I answered at least half of your questions. So a shout out to my boy year of

[29:01.860 --> 29:09.220]  dog. He's chewing on a deer antler and uh, yeah, it's the, here he comes. What's up boy.
[29:09.220 --> 29:12.500]  All right. Mick the dog is going to find a camping spot right here by my feet. I'm going
