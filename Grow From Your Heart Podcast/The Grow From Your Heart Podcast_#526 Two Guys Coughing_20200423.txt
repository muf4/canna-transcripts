[00:00.000 --> 00:01.280]  All right. What's up podcast world.
[00:01.280 --> 00:05.120]  Welcome to episode 526 of the grow from your heart podcast. Today,
[00:05.120 --> 00:09.040]  we are doing something new today. Joining me on zoom. We have got white Mike,
[00:09.060 --> 00:11.920]  welcome to the show, bro. What's up, man? Dude.
[00:11.920 --> 00:16.080]  Thanks for joining me in these weird COVID times from the bunker,
[00:16.240 --> 00:17.800]  from the bunkers out. You're going to call it.
[00:17.800 --> 00:20.400]  You got an official name for your recording spot. It is now the bunker,
[00:20.560 --> 00:24.240]  but I just threw that out. That's going to stick for the, that's how it goes.
[00:24.480 --> 00:27.440]  Yeah. This is going to be fun, man. We got Mike, some recording gear.
[00:27.440 --> 00:30.640]  He's finally found some time. He's got the, did you sedate those kids, bro?
[00:30.640 --> 00:31.480]  Or is that natural?
[00:32.160 --> 00:35.160]  I do. We didn't nap today and I ran them hard this evening.
[00:35.160 --> 00:38.280]  Just let them run around in the backyard and go ape shit right until bedtime.
[00:38.280 --> 00:39.320]  So they're out.
[00:39.840 --> 00:43.240]  Good. Good. Hopefully we can do this once a week or so and get you dialed in.
[00:43.880 --> 00:46.400]  I've got at least three hours of them sleeping,
[00:46.420 --> 00:49.120]  but they will be going hard at 7. So,
[00:49.480 --> 00:52.720]  so does that mean three hours show from the bunker? Is that what you just said?
[00:53.320 --> 00:54.160]  Maybe.
[00:55.080 --> 00:57.800]  I like this. We're going to learn how to do this so far.
[00:57.800 --> 01:00.560]  I feel like we're comfortable. You may be a little bit louder. Actually,
[01:00.560 --> 01:03.520]  I'll just turn myself down a bit, but then I think we'll fucking even out.
[01:04.120 --> 01:06.120]  This would be a good time, dude. So welcome to the show.
[01:06.120 --> 01:09.440]  Mike thanks for the audio folks. We're we're trying something new.
[01:09.880 --> 01:13.040]  Yeah, we are. I'm sure most of the people listening we got to keep in mind.
[01:13.040 --> 01:14.640]  It's a podcast. This will live forever.
[01:14.640 --> 01:18.800]  Most of the people listening currently are aware that we are under stay at home
[01:18.840 --> 01:22.320]  orders from our government. There is a virus. Yeah. Please stay home.
[01:22.320 --> 01:22.840]  Help us out.
[01:22.840 --> 01:27.240]  There's a virus spreading and it is causing hysteria and illness and death.
[01:27.600 --> 01:29.000]  And so we've been asked to stay home.
[01:29.480 --> 01:33.360]  Mike lives across town and he's also got two young children and a family.
[01:33.360 --> 01:36.920]  So Mike doesn't need to get me sick. I don't need to get Mike and his kids sick.
[01:36.920 --> 01:39.280]  We're trying to be good citizens and we're going to stay at home.
[01:39.280 --> 01:40.800]  So we're going to do some shows from zoom.
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.720]  I'm sure most of the people are doing, yeah, we're going to get creative here.
[01:43.960 --> 01:45.560]  I'm sure most of the people are doing shit from home.
[01:45.560 --> 01:48.840]  They're going to be excited just to have content while they're on the home stay.
[01:48.880 --> 01:52.240]  So if like Mike said, if we do get any weird audio glitches,
[01:52.520 --> 01:54.560]  we'll get it figured out. This is our first time trying this.
[01:54.720 --> 01:56.240]  Forgive us our trespasses.
[01:56.760 --> 01:58.680]  Yeah, I think I'm pretty good at tech gear and editing.
[01:58.680 --> 01:59.920]  So we'll make this sound. All right.
[02:00.240 --> 02:02.720]  It sounds great. My headphones. I don't know about yours.
[02:02.800 --> 02:05.240]  That sounds good in my head, but who knows what it's doing in the recording gear.
[02:05.240 --> 02:07.560]  Maybe we should look at that and see that that's happening. Dude,
[02:07.560 --> 02:10.000]  that looks good too. I think we're doing it. We're recording a podcast, Mike.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.280]  Congrats. Before we get too far.

[02:58.960 --> 03:01.320]  what are you smoking on over there, bro? I saw you take a big fat dab.
[03:01.320 --> 03:02.160]  What you got?
[03:02.440 --> 03:04.280]  I've got all sorts of goodies right now.
[03:04.280 --> 03:08.360]  I just went on a resupply run to apothecary.
[03:08.560 --> 03:12.440]  I've got the last one was some Blackberry banana cush.
[03:13.760 --> 03:14.760]  That sounds delicious.
[03:15.480 --> 03:18.720]  I went specifically for more of the sour diesel Ambrosia.
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.680]  I've gone through a couple of grams of that in quarantine and had to go re-up
[03:23.840 --> 03:26.880]  and ended up coming home with a lot more hash than I intended to buy,
[03:26.880 --> 03:27.720]  which happens.
[03:27.920 --> 03:30.960]  I wasn't going to bring up that you went in today when you shopped, bro,
[03:30.960 --> 03:34.200]  you went uncharacteristic. That was a hard word for my face to say.
[03:34.760 --> 03:37.520]  It was unlike you, how hard you went in your shopping spree today.
[03:38.120 --> 03:42.480]  I, uh, I kind of chuckled and like, I've been good for quarantine. I've, uh,
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.400]  I've really only left the house once or twice since the end of March. Um,
[03:48.240 --> 03:49.080]  and uh,
[03:49.200 --> 03:50.520]  one of them was a donut run.
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.200]  Yeah. On my birthday I had to have, I wanted a donut for breakfast.
[03:54.200 --> 03:57.320]  So I said, fuck it. And when made a donut run as safe as I could.
[03:57.520 --> 04:00.760]  A lot of podcast listeners just told you happy birthday. So happy birthday,
[04:00.800 --> 04:02.320]  way late, but happy birthday, Mike.
[04:02.760 --> 04:03.600]  Yeah. Thanks y'all.
[04:04.760 --> 04:07.360]  So you went shopping. Let's I'm going to segue right into that. Uh,
[04:07.440 --> 04:08.920]  actually I'm gonna tell everybody what I'm smoking.
[04:08.920 --> 04:11.960]  I also am smoking a apothecary farms concentrates.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.760]  I just hit Malibu pure Kush Ambrosia. Uh,
[04:14.760 --> 04:19.720]  the package says 72.9% THC, 84.7% total cannabinoids.
[04:20.240 --> 04:22.800]  Uh, the Malibu put pure Kush tastes like Kush.
[04:22.840 --> 04:26.520]  I know that sounds like a stupid ass description if you're not a Kush smoker,
[04:26.520 --> 04:31.480]  but it is exactly what I expect from a good Kush. It's got that earthy, funky,
[04:32.040 --> 04:36.200]  uh, nastiness and the Malibu has a little sweetness to it. So that's the Kush.
[04:36.480 --> 04:38.560]  I was going to ask about your shopping experience.
[04:38.600 --> 04:41.440]  You said you went to the dispensary today. How well was that?
[04:41.440 --> 04:43.960]  How did that happen? And how different is it from normal?
[04:46.160 --> 04:49.120]  I got, I'm shopping meds. So, uh,
[04:49.160 --> 04:52.960]  meds still allowed in the store is basically a normal shopping run. Only.
[04:52.960 --> 04:56.200]  I was in a mask, which was odd. Um,
[04:56.320 --> 05:00.360]  I was the compliance guy for a long time for a couple of different outfits.
[05:00.360 --> 05:05.120]  And so the different rules we play by here in Colorado are kind of always in my
[05:05.120 --> 05:08.080]  head and having my face covered the whole time.
[05:08.080 --> 05:12.320]  It was just alarm bells going off in my head. Like, Oh, do rule seven rule seven.
[05:12.680 --> 05:15.440]  It's really weird. It's not a real thing, but like, no,
[05:15.560 --> 05:18.280]  but anybody who's deals with the med knows what I'm talking about.
[05:18.720 --> 05:21.520]  They want your ID checked two or three times in the dispensary.
[05:21.520 --> 05:24.800]  When you check in the guy at the door or the gal at the door or the non-binary
[05:24.800 --> 05:27.560]  gendered person at the door checks in your ID and they go, Oh, that's you.
[05:27.560 --> 05:30.760]  It looks like you, the eye color, the height, the fucking hair color,
[05:30.840 --> 05:32.600]  but the hair color doesn't even matter. Now we've all got,
[05:32.600 --> 05:33.920]  everyone's got fucking rainbow hair,
[05:34.160 --> 05:36.480]  but the eyes and the fucking height look kind of like you.
[05:36.480 --> 05:38.120]  The picture looks like you, it says you're old enough.
[05:38.120 --> 05:40.760]  You can shop in our store. Then when you go back to shop,
[05:40.760 --> 05:43.800]  they pass your ID to the person who is serving you.
[05:43.920 --> 05:46.400]  We call them a bud tender and they verify you again,
[05:46.600 --> 05:50.440]  just because if they sell to you and you're not old enough or you're not a
[05:50.440 --> 05:54.040]  medical marijuana patient, they can, they're being charged with a crime.
[05:54.040 --> 05:56.320]  They just illegally sold a controlled substance to you.
[05:56.320 --> 05:57.680]  So they double check that ID.
[05:58.200 --> 06:00.000]  It can be a hundred grand to the shop.
[06:00.200 --> 06:01.360]  Shit. It can be people in jail.
[06:01.400 --> 06:04.400]  We've got friends who have ended up in jail because of weird stings.
[06:04.440 --> 06:08.840]  Um, and because of the, the increased penalties,
[06:08.840 --> 06:13.760]  the compliance rate is over 90% for comparison with
[06:13.760 --> 06:17.600]  tobacco. It's usually in the high eighties or mid to high eighties.
[06:17.680 --> 06:20.440]  And so we're several points up with, uh,
[06:21.000 --> 06:24.280]  with the increase for the cannabis sales because the rules are harsher.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.960]  So you're in the dispensary, you've got gloves, you've got a mask.
[06:28.280 --> 06:32.160]  I didn't glove up. I was however, carrying a disinfecting wipe.
[06:32.160 --> 06:33.800]  That's yeah. I remember the wipe in your store.
[06:35.360 --> 06:39.000]  Um, but yeah, it was, uh, other than the mask,
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.320]  it was a pretty normal shopping trip. And it's, uh,
[06:42.840 --> 06:46.320]  four 19 is we're recording this. So four 20 Eve,
[06:46.360 --> 06:50.000]  bro in six minutes, it's going to be four 20. I just looked at the clock.
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.800]  We were recording it. It's going to be Zachary five minutes away till four 20.
[06:53.800 --> 06:55.520]  Now. Hell yeah. Cheers brother.
[06:55.880 --> 07:00.280]  So that in this being the first time I've left the house and like
[07:00.880 --> 07:06.160]  fuck 18 days, 19 days. Um, I kind of went a little nutty. It was like,
[07:06.160 --> 07:09.200]  you know what? I came for those two. Give me one of them, one of them,
[07:09.200 --> 07:12.600]  one of them, one of them. Um, I was good on flour,
[07:12.600 --> 07:16.000]  but I've got more flour coming. Yes, you do.
[07:16.360 --> 07:19.440]  Today was just a hash run. I've already seen your flower. Ha ha.
[07:19.440 --> 07:21.280]  I got to see it first and it smells really good.
[07:21.280 --> 07:23.000]  Shout out to the grower that got your flower going.
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.840]  He knows who he is and it smells really delicious.
[07:25.560 --> 07:28.440]  We had a friend help me out with some flowers today and Mike's going to get
[07:28.480 --> 07:30.920]  some of the help and he's going to love it. It smells really great.
[07:31.960 --> 07:36.000]  The dispensaries are different. I've been to, uh, if you watch the recreational,
[07:36.000 --> 07:36.840]  so you were there.
[07:36.840 --> 07:41.560]  I was glad I was shopping med because there was no line. Um,
[07:41.600 --> 07:45.200]  the rec line was substantial. Um,
[07:45.920 --> 07:48.240]  everybody in their cars, I didn't count the cars,
[07:48.240 --> 07:49.440]  but there were more than a few.
[07:49.840 --> 07:52.520]  So you said in their cars, they're not allowed to go inside the store now,
[07:52.520 --> 07:53.120]  right?
[07:53.120 --> 07:57.200]  Yep. It's all, uh, they're doing all drive up at the store I was at.
[07:57.440 --> 08:00.200]  Yeah. So you've got to, I had a friend who went to the phone in your order,
[08:00.520 --> 08:03.640]  got to call it in, tell that you go to weed maps, weed maps shows the current
[08:03.640 --> 08:06.600]  menu. It's got good pictures of the product. You go to weed maps,
[08:06.600 --> 08:08.880]  see what you want. You write down a little list. You give them a call.
[08:08.880 --> 08:11.720]  You say, Hey, I want this. And they tell you, come in 15 to 30 minutes.
[08:12.160 --> 08:12.800]  And then when you go,
[08:12.800 --> 08:15.680]  they ask you your name and they've got it bagged up with a receipt stapled to
[08:15.680 --> 08:18.600]  the bag. You give them cash. Uh, they run inside.
[08:18.840 --> 08:21.600]  They would come out with your change. Uh, honestly, you just tell them,
[08:21.640 --> 08:24.320]  keep the change. You try to math it out, right? It's like in a hundred bucks.
[08:24.320 --> 08:25.760]  You give them a one 20 or one 10.
[08:25.760 --> 08:28.120]  You tell them have a good day and you send them on their way. Uh,
[08:28.160 --> 08:31.040]  then they bring out your bag and you don't even have to get out of the car
[08:31.040 --> 08:35.680]  right now, dude, I wish I kind of wish they could keep it like that forever
[08:35.680 --> 08:36.720]  because that would just make it.
[08:38.240 --> 08:41.520]  When we legalized cannabis in Colorado,
[08:41.520 --> 08:46.200]  we agreed to a lot of rules just to placate the
[08:46.200 --> 08:50.760]  people who were against us. We agreed to a lot of over and above.
[08:51.640 --> 08:52.480]  Um,
[08:53.040 --> 08:56.400]  and I think a lot of that is going to get dialed back during this.
[08:56.400 --> 09:00.200]  I think that's going to be one of the little fucked up silver lining lockdown.
[09:00.680 --> 09:04.400]  Okay. We're good. Um, I think we're going to slowly, you know,
[09:04.400 --> 09:08.240]  as we come out of this, some of the rules we changed to deal with this,
[09:08.240 --> 09:12.560]  they're going to have to justify going back to the way it was like curbside
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.080]  pickup at dispensaries is wonderfully convenient. Um, as a parent,
[09:17.080 --> 09:20.480]  it's kind of a pain in the ass because I've, if I'm out of the house,
[09:20.520 --> 09:24.080]  there's an 80% chance I've got the kids in the back of the car. Um,
[09:24.160 --> 09:26.120]  and I can't take kids into a dispensary.
[09:26.120 --> 09:28.800]  They physically can't enter the building. Right. Um,
[09:28.840 --> 09:31.120]  and it's not like there's consumption happening there.
[09:31.360 --> 09:36.200]  Cause nobody's got a tasting room permit yet, but, uh, it's,
[09:36.240 --> 09:39.720]  it's always been sort of an over and above rule we've dealt with in the curbside
[09:39.720 --> 09:41.640]  pickup gets around that so well.
[09:43.720 --> 09:47.040]  So your kids are the age now to where you can take them to the dispensary.
[09:47.040 --> 09:48.640]  How long until you think that runs out?
[09:49.680 --> 09:52.240]  It depends on the communication between you and your kids as things evolve.
[09:52.240 --> 09:52.680]  Right.
[09:52.680 --> 09:57.680]  Well, I'm not really like they know about the world and cannabis is in the world.
[09:58.280 --> 10:01.040]  And so like, as they grow up, it's just going to be like,
[10:01.040 --> 10:03.600]  that's the thing that adults do. Like I'm not worried about.
[10:03.600 --> 10:05.400]  That's a, that's a, I never thought of,
[10:05.400 --> 10:09.320]  I haven't put my brain in that perspective, but the kids after my daughter,
[10:09.320 --> 10:10.400]  my daughter's 16,
[10:10.680 --> 10:13.480]  the kids after that are going to grow up with normalized cannabis.
[10:13.480 --> 10:15.320]  It's going to be just like when, uh,
[10:15.640 --> 10:19.080]  whoever used to stop on the way to the beach or on the way to wherever and grab
[10:19.080 --> 10:19.920]  a six pack of beer.
[10:20.160 --> 10:23.280]  Now you stop and grab a couple of pre-roll pre-rolls or an eighth or whatever.
[10:23.280 --> 10:25.280]  It's just part of life now. That's kind of great. Thanks, Mike.
[10:25.280 --> 10:26.480]  I'm glad you opened my brain to that.
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.960]  My belief on the subject is kind of based on my interpretation of when I first
[10:32.600 --> 10:34.960]  found out about pot. And I was like, wait, what do you mean?
[10:35.320 --> 10:37.880]  You kept it secret until now? That's weird.
[10:38.440 --> 10:41.720]  Like there's all kinds of dangerous shit you don't want me doing in the world.
[10:41.720 --> 10:45.120]  But like this one was a secret till now. Why?
[10:45.760 --> 10:49.120]  I've got to get my hands on some of this shit. Um,
[10:50.040 --> 10:53.560]  and I want to see what happens to society when that goes away.
[10:54.120 --> 10:57.520]  When it's just like, Oh, what are those guys doing? Oh,
[10:57.520 --> 11:02.000]  there's a thing in the world called cannabis. And if you smoke it, it's fun.
[11:02.760 --> 11:07.760]  And adults do it just like beer or just like bungee jumping or whatever else.
[11:08.640 --> 11:13.560]  Like there's all kinds of shit that adults do that kids shouldn't like,
[11:15.000 --> 11:15.840]  yeah.
[11:15.840 --> 11:19.480]  Take all the weirdness away. Maybe that's part of why, um,
[11:20.080 --> 11:22.720]  I wasn't super, I was never afraid of cannabis. I grew up,
[11:22.760 --> 11:25.240]  you guys have heard about my uncles on the podcast several times.
[11:25.240 --> 11:27.240]  They just used to smoke like it was nothing.
[11:27.600 --> 11:30.080]  And so I just grew up like it was, that's just what you do.
[11:30.080 --> 11:32.920]  Like before you go to the baseball game, you're fucking burn one down in the car.
[11:33.440 --> 11:35.640]  Um, it's so fun.
[11:35.640 --> 11:40.640]  We've come so far since we were kids and like things we can get away with doing
[11:41.120 --> 11:42.040]  around each other.
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.560]  Like there's a great picture that goes around on Facebook of like an eight year
[11:46.560 --> 11:48.360]  old blowing out the candles on their cake.
[11:48.720 --> 11:52.680]  And there's like six beers and an ashtray and a cigar and like three cigarettes
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.320]  in the frame while right around on top of this kid, you couldn't do any of that
[11:57.320 --> 12:00.760]  now. But when we were kids, it was common. Like, Oh yeah.
[12:01.080 --> 12:01.600]  No,
[12:01.600 --> 12:04.800]  I've had a number of stories that involve me getting accidentally burned by a
[12:04.800 --> 12:08.800]  cigarette just because smokers were everywhere around kids and being a kid,
[12:09.120 --> 12:11.400]  you'd sometimes wander into a lit cigarette.
[12:11.520 --> 12:14.760]  Yeah. Used to smoke in the mall and the store and the restaurant.
[12:14.760 --> 12:17.480]  They used to have a smoking section in the restaurant. Yeah.
[12:17.520 --> 12:20.720]  It used to be ridiculous. Mike, we're telling everybody how old we are right now.
[12:20.720 --> 12:24.880]  This is fucking weird sounding like two old crazy fucking old stoners.
[12:24.960 --> 12:28.240]  Also congrats. How long are you on cigarette freeness?
[12:29.080 --> 12:31.880]  Do you sense January 22nd? So like.
[12:32.360 --> 12:34.840]  All three months, bro. Congrats. That's awesome.
[12:34.880 --> 12:37.120]  It's like close to 90 days. That's fucking rad.
[12:37.120 --> 12:38.560]  I switched to Tootsie pops.
[12:38.560 --> 12:40.320]  So a veg thing on this.
[12:40.520 --> 12:43.480]  That's why I said it because I saw you pull the Tootsie pop out and set it down
[12:43.480 --> 12:46.440]  and what should be the ashtray, but it's now the Tootsie roll pop holder.
[12:47.080 --> 12:50.000]  It do things got hairy for a minute. The shipment was late.
[12:51.280 --> 12:54.720]  My Tootsie pops almost didn't come in and I was like, fuck, I'm not going to do
[12:54.760 --> 12:57.320]  scratching your neck over there. Y'all got some of them Tootsie pops.
[12:57.320 --> 12:59.200]  That's fucking funny, bro. That is funny.
[12:59.200 --> 13:02.160]  I'm going to interrupt the show because we normally do some shout outs to our
[13:02.160 --> 13:04.400]  friends who support the show on Patreon at the top of the show.
[13:04.400 --> 13:05.320]  And I did not do that,
[13:05.840 --> 13:08.800]  but I love them and you're taking a drink and it's a really good time to do that.
[13:09.280 --> 13:12.160]  Usually I do something silly. We roll up fat digital blunts.
[13:12.160 --> 13:14.560]  We pack up digital bong grips and we pass them to our friends.
[13:14.800 --> 13:16.120]  So how about we do it like this?
[13:16.160 --> 13:18.960]  All of my friends in this episode are going to get a big digital dab.
[13:18.960 --> 13:21.600]  So let's start off with the big shout out to my buddy, Callie canopy.
[13:21.880 --> 13:24.400]  Let's follow that up with a big shout out to my friend freak fish.
[13:24.720 --> 13:26.560]  I want to send some love to our friend Meredith.
[13:26.800 --> 13:29.840]  How about a big high five and a fist bump to Mark Moscow?
[13:30.120 --> 13:32.520]  How about a big high five to Gregory Segura?
[13:32.600 --> 13:34.200]  Maybe I shouldn't be saying everybody's full names.
[13:34.200 --> 13:37.040]  I don't know why I wrote down full names today. That was fucking awkward.
[13:37.120 --> 13:40.040]  How about a big shout out to Eric Ross? Let's send to some. Yeah.
[13:40.520 --> 13:43.000]  Hope your wife knows you're fucking contributing to Patreon.
[13:43.280 --> 13:47.360]  How about some love to Nora Cal Irie? Let's send a big shout out to Ryan S.
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.040]  I want to send some love to Spruce Hill farm and last but not least,
[13:51.040 --> 13:54.200]  how about a big shout out to all of, how about a shout out to Tanner M. Sorry,
[13:54.240 --> 13:57.080]  I'm high and stumbling and got fucking laughing at the fact that I read
[13:57.080 --> 13:59.240]  everybody's full name out there. Um,
[13:59.280 --> 14:01.920]  big shout out to all of our friends who do support the show on Patreon.
[14:02.120 --> 14:05.320]  We do appreciate the support. That is how Mike got recording gear.
[14:05.320 --> 14:08.920]  You guys on Patreon funded Mike's recording equipment. So I say thank you.
[14:09.040 --> 14:12.640]  Mike is unmuting his gear to say thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[14:12.920 --> 14:14.080]  Yeah, for sure. He's been having fun.
[14:14.080 --> 14:16.720]  We took a couple of zoom sessions and chatted to get used to this.
[14:16.960 --> 14:19.680]  I think we're getting good at it. You guys, if you are not yet, Oh,
[14:20.240 --> 14:23.040]  Mike you're fucking good at this, where you're like a fucking a pro already.
[14:23.240 --> 14:26.080]  If you're not already subscribed to my Patreon campaign and you would like to
[14:26.080 --> 14:27.120]  learn how to support the show,
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.680]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[14:32.080 --> 14:35.320]  I did include a link in the show notes because I like to make it easy for my
[14:35.320 --> 14:38.360]  stone friends. Click the link, help us out on Patreon.
[14:38.640 --> 14:41.360]  And also we're going to set Mike up a Patreon campaign.
[14:41.520 --> 14:43.560]  So we'll get that going hopefully in the next episode.
[14:43.720 --> 14:46.560]  We should probably just press pause and do it, but we'll keep moving right now.
[14:46.600 --> 14:48.560]  We'll make it real easy for you to find. Um,
[14:48.600 --> 14:51.280]  it'll probably just search for white Mike on Patreon.
[14:51.680 --> 14:53.640]  Something like that'll come up. We'll get you going. Mike,
[14:53.640 --> 14:55.480]  we're going to make you some, some Patreon funding,
[14:56.200 --> 15:00.880]  grow from your heart podcast slash Mike, maybe something like that. Yeah.
[15:00.920 --> 15:04.440]  We'll get it going. But, um, Mike wasn't confident in doing the Patreon,
[15:04.440 --> 15:07.640]  but since I've said it on the show, now it's going to happen. So big shout out.
[15:08.160 --> 15:11.560]  Yeah. Big shout out to all of our friends on Patreon for keeping us accountable.
[15:11.880 --> 15:13.840]  Um, I try to talk about cannabis on the show.
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.760]  I also try to talk about events that are current, man.
[15:17.760 --> 15:20.640]  I saw something in the news and Mike saw something in the news today and I
[15:20.640 --> 15:24.320]  didn't want to talk too much about it cause I avoid all this COVID stuff.
[15:24.320 --> 15:27.440]  And I wasn't sure how big of a deal it was. It annoyed me. It frustrated me.
[15:27.800 --> 15:29.720]  Mike called me earlier. And the first thing he said was,
[15:29.720 --> 15:30.880]  you see these fucking idiots?
[15:33.320 --> 15:35.160]  Yeah. Don't be a COVID protester.
[15:35.680 --> 15:35.960]  Yeah.
[15:35.960 --> 15:40.600]  There are people in Denver surrounding the Denver Capitol building protesting
[15:40.600 --> 15:44.760]  the stay at home orders for the COVID-19, uh, protective orders,
[15:44.760 --> 15:48.800]  protective measures. That's kind of silly. Yeah. Don't do that.
[15:49.280 --> 15:53.440]  Like my whole, my whole take is like, what if you're wrong? Like,
[15:54.600 --> 15:55.760]  like that's just been one of the,
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.720]  like if you're going to advocate for major shit like that, like,
[15:58.720 --> 16:02.480]  what if you're wrong? Like I get that it sucks. I fucking hate it too.
[16:02.520 --> 16:03.560]  But what if you're wrong?
[16:04.120 --> 16:04.360]  Yeah.
[16:04.360 --> 16:08.080]  What if you were fucking wrong and you're out there getting everybody out there
[16:08.080 --> 16:08.920]  sick?
[16:09.040 --> 16:12.600]  Like I know if like a lot of people that have businesses want to get their shit
[16:12.600 --> 16:13.960]  open right away, but like,
[16:14.400 --> 16:18.320]  have you taken a minute to imagine what that it would feel like to read the
[16:18.320 --> 16:22.520]  headline? Like my business infects 50 people,
[16:22.520 --> 16:26.040]  kills three people. Yeah. Like, have you considered that?
[16:26.040 --> 16:29.920]  Like I get that it sucks that your business can't be open right now or that you
[16:29.920 --> 16:34.680]  can't do your thing or can't go enjoy whatever activity you're taking vacation
[16:34.680 --> 16:39.120]  or, but like just stay home fucking let's get through that shit so we can be
[16:39.120 --> 16:41.200]  done with this and be able to have it all be over.
[16:41.560 --> 16:45.080]  Yeah. Yeah. If we don't stay home and stop volleying the virus,
[16:45.080 --> 16:48.320]  the virus will keep bouncing and they will keep extending the stay at home
[16:48.320 --> 16:52.440]  orders. I don't know how real this is, but my fear is that, uh,
[16:52.880 --> 16:57.200]  if we don't voluntarily just start staying at home, they will eventually,
[16:57.320 --> 17:00.280]  whoever they are. I know I'm still like one of those Eddie Bravo conspiracy
[17:00.280 --> 17:00.640]  theorists,
[17:00.640 --> 17:03.880]  but there will be some measures taken to force us to stay at home and limit our
[17:03.880 --> 17:07.120]  movement right now. They are requesting. And if we comply with requests,
[17:07.480 --> 17:08.760]  that's cool. But if we don't,
[17:08.760 --> 17:11.280]  I think they may up their game a little bit in the future.
[17:12.520 --> 17:13.760]  Maybe, but I'm,
[17:13.840 --> 17:16.480]  I'm way more worried about the stupid people that I am about.
[17:16.480 --> 17:18.760]  Like the government trying to insist we stay home.
[17:19.280 --> 17:23.280]  Like I agree with that. Are they almost out there Darwin-ing themselves?
[17:23.280 --> 17:24.120]  Are they kind of,
[17:24.200 --> 17:27.880]  Oh for sure. Like it's been really hard for me not to be super mean on social
[17:27.880 --> 17:32.880]  media. Um, like if we'll know for sure in two weeks,
[17:32.880 --> 17:37.440]  sure in two weeks. But like if two weeks from April 19th,
[17:37.760 --> 17:41.040]  cause it was all this weekend, if in about two weeks, the,
[17:41.080 --> 17:45.040]  the hospital numbers spike, this is why it's the protests.
[17:46.720 --> 17:51.360]  And it's like, it's, it sucks, but it's so easy to stay home right now.
[17:52.080 --> 17:55.280]  Like it really sucks, but it's super easy to stay home right now.
[17:55.480 --> 17:58.400]  It's really boring, but I mean, it's free. You could chill out at home.
[17:58.400 --> 17:59.240]  It's not free.
[17:59.560 --> 18:00.880]  Anything delivered. You can get,
[18:01.040 --> 18:04.080]  I've had the weirdest shit delivered the last month.
[18:04.760 --> 18:07.240]  Weirdest thing you've had delivered. What's the weirdest thing?
[18:07.800 --> 18:12.800]  Booze, ammo, hand cream. Like we literally made our own hand sanitizer.
[18:15.480 --> 18:20.480]  We had isopropyl alcohol delivered and aloe vera delivered and my wife fucking
[18:22.200 --> 18:25.000]  magic that shit in a hand, hand sanitizer.
[18:25.520 --> 18:27.800]  And so like we made homemade hand sanitizer.
[18:27.960 --> 18:31.440]  You had all this stuff for delivered fun for the whole family.
[18:32.960 --> 18:36.000]  I've had a fucking truckload of Tootsie pops delivered.
[18:36.280 --> 18:39.280]  That's funny. I heard your story about string cheese.
[18:40.880 --> 18:41.720]  Yeah. The,
[18:42.040 --> 18:47.040]  my wife's clicked the wrong size of string cheese and we got like an encyclopedia,
[18:48.600 --> 18:52.160]  an encyclopedia Britannica set size thing is strange.
[18:52.920 --> 18:53.760]  Um,
[18:55.120 --> 18:58.360]  the kids are happy as shit with it cause there's a lifetime supply of string
[18:58.380 --> 19:01.960]  cheese in the fridge. Yeah. And less diapers to change. I bet after all that.
[19:02.160 --> 19:03.000]  Yup.
[19:05.400 --> 19:09.240]  But yeah, like you can watch anything. I've got Disney plus.
[19:09.680 --> 19:14.240]  So we just watched all of rescue Rangers like three times through.
[19:15.040 --> 19:19.640]  Random. All of the GI Joe episodes are up on Hasbro's YouTube channel.
[19:19.640 --> 19:21.280]  You can watch all the old GI Joe.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.680]  We're working our way through the old duck tales now. Duck tales.
[19:28.080 --> 19:31.520]  Yeah. I'm loving it. Like just enjoying a little flash from my childhood.
[19:31.760 --> 19:34.440]  I want quarantine to be over so I can watch cartoons with you and your kids.
[19:34.960 --> 19:36.520]  You're kind of living the dream over there, bro.
[19:37.400 --> 19:38.320]  It's really kind of,
[19:38.360 --> 19:41.800]  it's really not that bad once you get used to just being at home all the time.
[19:42.280 --> 19:46.280]  I'm a grower and kinda, I like social, don't get me wrong, but you know me,
[19:46.320 --> 19:50.760]  if you say stay home for seven days, I'm like, sure. Okay. It's not a problem.
[19:50.800 --> 19:55.320]  Donors and gamers are way more equipped to handle these stay at home requests.
[19:55.480 --> 20:00.360]  They absolutely. I caught a Bert Kreischer's new comedy special.
[20:00.400 --> 20:05.200]  It was hot fire. I saw Tom Segura's new comedy special, hotter fire.
[20:05.440 --> 20:09.320]  I saw Chris D'Elia's new special. It was pretty good and fiery. But yeah,
[20:09.320 --> 20:11.240]  there's new comedy specials out to watch.
[20:11.480 --> 20:16.200]  We've got Netflix and Amazon prime and Hulu and dude,
[20:16.200 --> 20:18.040]  so many people have been doing cool live feeds.
[20:18.040 --> 20:21.560]  I've been doing more live feeds with my friends. Adam L is on live all the time.
[20:21.560 --> 20:22.920]  A bunch of good lives lately.
[20:23.360 --> 20:27.200]  Granny kind of lives on live right now. Live is just boom.
[20:27.200 --> 20:30.680]  And live is the place Instagram live. You guys, that's what I'm talking about.
[20:30.680 --> 20:35.240]  Everyone's on Instagram live and zoom doing zoom shows. I've done a couple,
[20:35.240 --> 20:37.920]  I did a show with Scotty. I did the cannabis for 20 zoom.
[20:38.280 --> 20:39.920]  So we've been trying to put out extra content.
[20:40.480 --> 20:42.200]  So we're talking about that stay at home protests.
[20:42.200 --> 20:45.320]  There are people that we should give some respect to. Um,
[20:45.320 --> 20:47.640]  there were medical, what do you call them?
[20:47.720 --> 20:50.600]  Cause there weren't all nurses that are medical professionals. There we go.
[20:50.600 --> 20:55.480]  There are medical professionals in their scrubs and with masks. Yeah.
[20:55.520 --> 20:57.920]  They were. So when, uh, how are they doing it, Michael?
[20:57.920 --> 20:59.640]  It should use you were the one that pointed out to me.
[21:00.320 --> 21:02.600]  The article I read in the first, uh,
[21:02.640 --> 21:05.320]  the first pictures I saw on social media was two of them.
[21:05.320 --> 21:08.920]  They were just when the red light hit, they were just staying in the crosswalk.
[21:08.960 --> 21:12.680]  That was appropriate for people to be in during that red light.
[21:12.720 --> 21:17.520]  And then when the crosswalk said, stop, get out the way they got out the way.
[21:18.000 --> 21:18.440]  Okay.
[21:18.440 --> 21:21.160]  They basically crossed the street back and forth and that was their March back
[21:21.160 --> 21:22.640]  and forth. Yeah. Crosswalk.
[21:23.280 --> 21:26.800]  They just kind of, when it was instead of crossing, they just stood there.
[21:27.440 --> 21:29.880]  And then when it said, all right, stop crossing now,
[21:29.920 --> 21:31.880]  there's a little countdown and then they got out the way.
[21:31.920 --> 21:33.440]  I think everybody knows how crosswalks work.
[21:33.560 --> 21:35.600]  Yeah. And they were just telling everybody go home.
[21:35.600 --> 21:38.760]  Cause this is fucking silly and that people are really sick in my hospital and
[21:38.760 --> 21:42.560]  I'm trying not to make you a patient also. One of my favorite things,
[21:42.680 --> 21:45.960]  you're there extra insulted. Like they're not, Oh yeah.
[21:46.240 --> 21:51.240]  Like they're putting their safety at risk to treat patient after patient after
[21:51.680 --> 21:56.680]  patient and dealing with all sorts of fucked up nest on top of it.
[21:57.160 --> 22:01.000]  Like people dying alone and having to be there with that and having to be the
[22:01.000 --> 22:02.600]  conduit of family on the phone.
[22:02.600 --> 22:06.880]  And like on a totally non COVID related situation,
[22:07.240 --> 22:12.240]  I have a family member dying in the hospital right now and having,
[22:12.920 --> 22:17.800]  people visit and not visit and can visit and can't visit.
[22:17.840 --> 22:19.640]  It's a fucking nightmare.
[22:19.760 --> 22:23.400]  Yeah. And my uncle passed by himself stuck in the middle.
[22:23.800 --> 22:27.120]  My uncle had to pass by himself a few weeks ago. So yeah, I'm sorry.
[22:27.120 --> 22:28.120]  You've got that going on, bro.
[22:28.480 --> 22:29.720]  Yeah.
[22:29.720 --> 22:34.720]  Their daughter can't leave the hospital because she can't come back.
[22:35.240 --> 22:38.440]  Yeah. And she's the last visitor on the list.
[22:38.440 --> 22:42.320]  So she's literally stuck there until this is over one way or the other.
[22:42.360 --> 22:45.600]  So I don't recall what I was doing the other day.
[22:46.520 --> 22:49.680]  I was doing something that I was doing something I could have gotten hurt the
[22:49.680 --> 22:51.960]  other day. And I was like, Nope, this isn't the time. Like,
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.520]  even if I just cut my, I forgot what I was like, I could put oops.
[22:54.520 --> 22:55.640]  And I was like, no, no, I'm not.
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.360]  I don't even need three stitches right now would be fucking way more traumatic
[22:59.360 --> 23:02.920]  than it needs to be. Cause I got to go to the hospital and yeah. Yeah.
[23:02.960 --> 23:05.440]  I was, I've been doing a lot of stuff that involves power tools.
[23:06.880 --> 23:07.960]  There's been a lot of the,
[23:07.960 --> 23:12.240]  like let's take an extra second for safety just because we really fucking don't
[23:12.280 --> 23:14.800]  want to go to the hospital today. Yep. Anything that happens right now,
[23:14.800 --> 23:18.520]  if it's not 13 stitches, if it's 12 stitches, it's happening at home. Yep.
[23:19.080 --> 23:22.680]  I got duct tape and crazy glue. Uh, Mike, this has been a fun podcast.
[23:22.680 --> 23:23.520]  I'm glad we did this.
[23:25.160 --> 23:27.400]  That sucks. Duct tape, crazy glue and Vaseline.
[23:28.440 --> 23:32.320]  Episode seems to be running smoothly. Yeah. Um, I noticed the recording comes out.
[23:32.400 --> 23:35.600]  I've noticed a technical glitch, but I can fix it and I know what I did wrong.
[23:35.600 --> 23:37.920]  So as long as I learned what I did wrong, uh,
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.320]  I can definitely solve that problem.
[23:39.840 --> 23:43.960]  I'm not in my usual spot. And so my microphone discipline is shit.
[23:44.440 --> 23:47.760]  I've noticed myself repeatedly leaning way back in my chair.
[23:48.240 --> 23:50.440]  For the most part, I think we're picking you up. Yeah.
[23:50.440 --> 23:54.200]  The sound seems good. My ear headphones anyway. Yeah. Yeah. That's why we got them.
[23:54.600 --> 23:57.600]  Um, let's see how long we've been going. Sorry guys. If you're listening to this,
[23:57.600 --> 23:59.560]  we are just meandering today and kind of learning this.
[23:59.960 --> 24:01.640]  We've been going for 24 and a half minutes,
[24:01.640 --> 24:03.640]  a little less than that because there will be some editing at the beginning
[24:03.640 --> 24:05.840]  there that will cut up and go for a little over 20 minutes.
[24:06.440 --> 24:09.280]  You got anything else on the cannabis hot seat that you want to bring up today?
[24:09.280 --> 24:12.800]  Mike, or should I kind of work into another topic for the show here?
[24:13.280 --> 24:15.840]  Let's jump to the next topic. Fuck those protesters.
[24:16.040 --> 24:18.960]  Yeah, that's just dumb shit, dude. That is just ridiculous.
[24:18.960 --> 24:20.360]  Putting other people at risk and you guys,
[24:20.360 --> 24:23.080]  we're going to stop talking about the COVID madness pretty soon here.
[24:23.080 --> 24:25.080]  It's just, you got to admit it is the hot topic.
[24:25.080 --> 24:28.080]  It's what's on all of our minds and it's what's got Mike and I doing this today.
[24:28.920 --> 24:33.760]  I feel like con I was listening to one of your older
[24:33.760 --> 24:37.800]  shows and you did a piece on like content producers having kind of a
[24:37.800 --> 24:40.640]  responsibility right now to help keep people entertained.
[24:41.360 --> 24:46.200]  And I thought that was a super legit thing to sort of kind of realize and
[24:46.200 --> 24:48.280]  embrace, but also like,
[24:50.280 --> 24:53.480]  it's important that we're here and we should use our,
[24:53.880 --> 24:56.400]  our space here to encourage people to stay home.
[24:56.400 --> 25:00.360]  Like I know how much it sucks. Like I'm fucking miserable too.
[25:00.360 --> 25:04.360]  Like I fully fantasized about like chucking one of my kids over the fence the
[25:04.360 --> 25:06.040]  other day just because.
[25:06.400 --> 25:09.520]  Remember, I'm not, I'm not able to edit this. This is not getting edited.
[25:11.120 --> 25:15.280]  It's tough. Like it's, it's really tough. Like I, I a hundred percent get it.
[25:17.280 --> 25:21.760]  But just do your best to stay the fuck home so we can get past this shit.
[25:21.960 --> 25:22.640]  If you think about it,
[25:22.640 --> 25:25.160]  you can stay home now or you can stay in the hospital later.
[25:25.320 --> 25:26.160]  That's kind of your option.
[25:26.520 --> 25:29.280]  That's, that's the thing that I'm so worried about today.
[25:29.280 --> 25:30.600]  Like there were a lot of people out,
[25:30.600 --> 25:34.360]  not as many are there normally out celebrating around the Capitol this weekend.
[25:35.080 --> 25:40.080]  But there were a shitload of people out and like carloads of people were packed
[25:40.080 --> 25:44.320]  in together for hours, driving in circles around the Capitol,
[25:45.720 --> 25:49.880]  packed like in heavy traffic with other cars, packed full of people,
[25:50.240 --> 25:54.280]  people walking around on the sidewalks, waving signs and shit in the parks.
[25:54.960 --> 25:59.040]  And like, I get how stir crazy everyone is,
[25:59.040 --> 26:02.880]  but like if the smart people are right,
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  a lot of people just got infected.
[26:06.560 --> 26:10.440]  All went home tonight and shared it with their family. Like,
[26:10.480 --> 26:12.000]  and that sucks.
[26:12.720 --> 26:15.680]  And if the smart people are right on this one in two weeks, it's going to be
[26:15.680 --> 26:16.320]  ugly.
[26:16.320 --> 26:18.520]  Yeah. Yep. If those people have two people,
[26:18.520 --> 26:21.560]  if half of the people got sick today, if a quarter of them got sick, I'm not,
[26:21.680 --> 26:23.960]  I'm not an epidemiologist. I'm not going to play that game.
[26:24.280 --> 26:28.360]  I have described it and compared it to the virus is almost,
[26:28.360 --> 26:32.840]  and this is just for my simple mind to grasp it. And, and for youngsters,
[26:32.840 --> 26:36.160]  I was talking to somebody much younger. Uh, it's like a volleyball.
[26:36.640 --> 26:39.720]  Somebody threw a volleyball up in the air and when it landed,
[26:39.720 --> 26:41.480]  somebody hit it and it broke into two.
[26:42.320 --> 26:43.880]  And then when that volleyball came back down,
[26:43.880 --> 26:46.880]  somebody hit those two and they turned in each one of them turned into two more.
[26:46.880 --> 26:49.400]  Every time the volleyball gets volleyed, it multiplies,
[26:49.400 --> 26:52.840]  it becomes two more volleyballs. And so we're out there in society,
[26:52.960 --> 26:55.120]  just volley in these volleyballs. Everyone's going to like,
[26:55.120 --> 26:57.160]  it's like at a fucking concert and the beach ball comes by.
[26:57.320 --> 26:59.280]  Everyone wants to hit it. No beach ball.
[26:59.640 --> 27:00.960]  And you hit it up in the air and it goes flying.
[27:00.960 --> 27:02.920]  And you don't think anything about it. Now you're infected.
[27:03.240 --> 27:05.160]  That ball's bouncing around just infecting everybody.
[27:05.480 --> 27:08.360]  If we would quit bouncing the fucking beach ball around,
[27:08.600 --> 27:11.240]  they would land on the ground and they would deflate and they would fucking die.
[27:11.280 --> 27:13.160]  And then we could go out there and not have to worry about beach balls.
[27:13.240 --> 27:14.520]  That's kind of the way I think about it.
[27:15.080 --> 27:17.920]  It's literally if everybody would just stay the fuck home,
[27:18.280 --> 27:20.200]  like as much as they possibly could.
[27:20.200 --> 27:21.680]  And keep your balls to yourself.
[27:22.440 --> 27:23.880]  Yeah. It's just super quick.
[27:24.280 --> 27:26.640]  Hey Mike, it's four 20. You want to take a dab, bro?
[27:26.680 --> 27:29.280]  I just realized we've been talking. It's 15 minutes into four 20.
[27:29.280 --> 27:30.480]  15 minutes into four 20.
[27:30.720 --> 27:32.160]  Yeah. I've got a dab loaded.
[27:33.200 --> 27:37.040]  Let's uh, yeah, let's end the plea to stay home.
[27:37.040 --> 27:39.840]  And uh, like if you need better weed, like
[27:41.480 --> 27:42.320]  that's a good segue.
[27:42.720 --> 27:44.280]  We can help you stay home people.
[27:44.520 --> 27:46.520]  Also, this is a good time to learn how to grow.
[27:46.920 --> 27:48.840]  So many people are buying seeds.
[27:48.880 --> 27:52.680]  I see so many people on Facebook groups and Instagram groups about how do I grow?
[27:52.680 --> 27:54.480]  How do I do this now is a good time.
[27:54.840 --> 27:57.560]  Delve into some books and podcasts and YouTube channels.
[27:57.560 --> 28:00.440]  You're not getting into cannabis. Do you get out and clean up your yard,
[28:00.440 --> 28:03.120]  clean up your house, clean up your shit. Like I'm lucky.
[28:03.120 --> 28:05.600]  We moved houses right before this shit.
[28:06.200 --> 28:10.720]  Like in the middle of February we moved and our move was kind of chaotic.
[28:10.720 --> 28:13.640]  So it didn't really end until the first week of March.
[28:14.120 --> 28:17.440]  So when they were like, all right, everybody tried to stay home. I was like,
[28:17.480 --> 28:20.120]  all right, finally a reason to unpack boxes.
[28:21.080 --> 28:21.920]  In peace.
[28:22.200 --> 28:23.040]  Um,
[28:23.320 --> 28:27.520]  the downside of that is I've got a vehicle that is like bursting with
[28:27.520 --> 28:30.960]  cardboard right now because I was getting ready to go take it to the recycle
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.240]  place. And the day I went to load it up and go,
[28:34.240 --> 28:38.480]  I see a notice that says they're not taking shit right now.
[28:38.960 --> 28:41.400]  Cause wherever they send it is closed due to the virus.
[28:41.920 --> 28:44.840]  And so literally I finished loading up the car and then I checked to make sure
[28:44.840 --> 28:47.720]  they were open that day. And I was like, aw,
[28:49.720 --> 28:50.960]  got a bunch of cardboard now.
[28:51.680 --> 28:52.520]  Yep.
[28:53.040 --> 28:55.360]  Yeah. That's one of the fun things I've been stockpiling.
[28:55.360 --> 28:57.560]  If anybody needs any boxes, fucking let me know.
[28:57.760 --> 29:01.160]  You trying to build a fork? I know you got shit to do.
[29:03.760 --> 29:07.160]  My boxes. These boxes were sent to me by fucking Jeff Bezos.
[29:07.560 --> 29:11.080]  That's fucking awesome. I got a bunch of Bezos boxes. Damn dude.
[29:11.560 --> 29:14.600]  This is my fucking forerunner is full to bursting with cardboard, dude.
[29:15.320 --> 29:18.560]  I catch myself ordering things online, shopping. They come here and I'm like,
[29:18.600 --> 29:19.840]  Oh cool. You bought new shoes.
[29:20.280 --> 29:22.640]  Go put those in the fucking closet cause you can't go anywhere.
[29:23.200 --> 29:25.360]  Like, oops, I had to stop myself doing that.
[29:25.360 --> 29:27.920]  You can play snare drums during the quarantine though.
[29:27.920 --> 29:29.960]  I've noticed that all of the drum equipment I buy,
[29:29.960 --> 29:33.360]  you can play the shit out of that during quarantine. It works really well.
[29:33.640 --> 29:36.440]  And I'm sure the neighbors have learned a lot of Led Zeppelin songs the past
[29:36.440 --> 29:37.280]  couple of weeks.
[29:38.960 --> 29:42.920]  One of my neighbors, they're two, they've got a couple of girls,
[29:42.920 --> 29:47.520]  maybe two or three of them. I that are maybe like six,
[29:47.520 --> 29:51.040]  eight and 12 ish. And every night at like seven 30,
[29:51.040 --> 29:53.520]  I think it's right after they do dinner, they go out back and scream.
[29:53.880 --> 29:56.760]  Like I can't see them. I'm just guessing from the, the sounds.
[29:56.760 --> 29:59.840]  That's a local thing, bro. It's called how for Pueblo every night.
[30:00.120 --> 30:03.080]  They're not howling. It's right after dinner. It's not at eight o'clock.
[30:03.080 --> 30:07.240]  It's like, they're just venting like that. We've been stuck inside all day.
[30:08.520 --> 30:10.680]  Okay. So they go out back and shout.
[30:10.880 --> 30:13.680]  A lot of cities are doing weird things to show solidarity.
[30:13.920 --> 30:16.160]  Some cities are howling and some cities are screaming.
[30:16.160 --> 30:18.040]  Some people are shining flashlights into the air.
[30:18.400 --> 30:22.440]  Me and the fam fully did the Pueblo shines thing. That was awesome. Nice.
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.880]  Like we had fun doing that every night. My kids really got into it.
[30:26.840 --> 30:28.320]  I see you loading up a dab. What you got?
[30:29.840 --> 30:33.720]  I'm going with the great Cola and I'm going to get myself in trouble.
[30:34.000 --> 30:35.960]  That's a big dad for you. I'm kind of impressed.
[30:36.200 --> 30:38.640]  That's a ginormous dad for me.
[30:39.280 --> 30:39.560]  All right.
[30:39.560 --> 30:42.760]  So there may be a moment of this podcast where there's just two guys coughing.
[30:42.800 --> 30:45.000]  Dude, that's our spinoff two guys.
[30:45.440 --> 30:49.680]  It's coughing. Someone's going to fucking steal it. No, it's ours. We're taking it.
[30:50.920 --> 30:54.080]  Copyright fucking. Yeah. Yeah. Two guys coughing.
[30:55.440 --> 30:57.160]  I'm going to heat up my dad. Now you guys,
[30:57.160 --> 31:00.600]  thanks for hanging out and joining us for a zoom video.
[31:00.600 --> 31:02.600]  I know you're not going to watch the video. You're not going to see the video.
[31:02.600 --> 31:04.720]  I agreed with Mike that we wouldn't do video this time.
[31:05.000 --> 31:06.480]  We're breaking Mike in slowly,
[31:06.640 --> 31:09.320]  but I want to thank you for joining us for this awkward episode of the growth
[31:09.320 --> 31:10.240]  from your heart podcast.
[31:10.240 --> 31:13.160]  The main point of life is to have fun and enjoy yourself and spend time with
[31:13.160 --> 31:15.880]  your friends. And I'm fucking doing that right now. Not just with Mike,
[31:15.880 --> 31:19.240]  but all my gang here listening in Mike's nodding his head as he's away from his
[31:19.240 --> 31:21.760]  Michael, he eats his nail, but he agrees. Thanks for hanging out.
[31:21.800 --> 31:23.960]  Thanks for being the army. I re army gang, gang,
[31:24.160 --> 31:27.480]  just getting this nail hot. And my setup is not heat.
[31:27.480 --> 31:30.080]  The nail talk on the microphone friendly. Sorry.
[31:30.720 --> 31:33.480]  That is the inaugural episode. We're working out some kinks.
[31:34.480 --> 31:37.960]  It's a skill to work the microphone and the torch and the gear.
[31:38.280 --> 31:41.480]  I remember an episode and Mike has spoken of the time that he tried to hit the
[31:41.520 --> 31:42.120]  microphone.
[31:42.120 --> 31:45.200]  He put his mouth on the mic and then put the dab on the dab nail and wondered
[31:45.200 --> 31:47.560]  why the smoke didn't flow. So yeah, there's,
[31:47.600 --> 31:51.800]  there's some tricks to this madness sometimes I'm going to talk until my nail is
[31:51.800 --> 31:52.640]  ready.
[31:52.840 --> 31:55.160]  This nail is not quite ready, but it's getting there.
[31:55.520 --> 31:58.240]  I overheated mine. I was just rambling, not paying attention.
[31:58.240 --> 32:01.360]  So I made mine into lava. We could reshape the glass if we needed to.
[32:03.720 --> 32:07.000]  I am going to hit more of the operations. Send Mike a clean banger.
[32:07.600 --> 32:10.480]  There we go. I know where there's a place that could be open for that banger.
[32:10.480 --> 32:12.320]  So we may have to send you there tomorrow.
[32:12.760 --> 32:15.720]  I'm going to hit the Malibu pure cush because it's what I've got on the table.
[32:16.640 --> 32:19.640]  It's cushy and it tastes delicious and it's obviously working for me.
[32:19.640 --> 32:21.080]  It's good podcast concentrate.
[32:21.680 --> 32:25.360]  I'm going with some great cola batter. Your batter looked really good, dude.
[32:25.520 --> 32:27.480]  I'm a big fan of the batter. I just went to the fridge.
[32:27.480 --> 32:30.000]  It looks fucking delicious and it smells so good.
[32:30.360 --> 32:33.000]  Yeah. I just went to the fridge.
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.800]  I keep my concentrates in the crisper drawer and I reached in and grabbed a jar
[32:35.800 --> 32:40.240]  and what came out was Malibu pure cush. So that's the dab for the day. All right.
[32:40.400 --> 32:43.560]  Happy 420 Mike happy 420 everybody. I'm going to hit a dab real quick.
[32:43.560 --> 32:46.120]  It'll be a moment of silence, but you guys smoke with us and it'll be just fine.
[32:46.120 --> 32:46.960]  Here we go.
[33:02.980 --> 33:07.100]  It's your bubbler bubbles and exhales. Good podcasting. Cheers everybody.
[33:07.100 --> 33:11.180]  It is 420. We're celebrating properly. Yeah. Mike just wrecked himself.
[33:11.180 --> 33:12.700]  We're going to let him cough for a couple of minutes.
[33:12.700 --> 33:13.940]  I'll talk over here for a moment.
[33:15.740 --> 33:18.460]  I'm going to take me places and it was delicious.
[33:19.180 --> 33:21.700]  You're kind of different colors right now on the video. That's kind of cool.
[33:21.740 --> 33:24.900]  Is that how red are you? When I dab like that? You've seen it. Yeah. Yeah.
[33:24.900 --> 33:29.060]  Now you've seen the, he's watching himself on the video guys. It's fucking funny.
[33:29.500 --> 33:31.980]  You ever watch one of your friends stare at himself in a video and forget that
[33:31.980 --> 33:33.180]  he's on video. That's pretty good.
[33:35.340 --> 33:40.340]  Longtime listeners may remark that that coughing fit was pretty shallow for my
[33:40.820 --> 33:41.660]  normals.
[33:41.700 --> 33:43.860]  That was pretty good, especially for the size dab you took.
[33:43.860 --> 33:46.580]  We could tell that the no smoking is working for you, bro.
[33:47.260 --> 33:51.140]  Yeah. I've been able to hit all of my cannabis products quite a bit harder
[33:51.140 --> 33:51.860]  lately.
[33:51.900 --> 33:54.500]  Good. Are you getting more stone from it?
[33:56.180 --> 34:00.340]  When I choose to hit them harder, I hurt myself with my dad pen.
[34:01.940 --> 34:04.420]  No, like the second day or second, third day of quarantine,
[34:04.420 --> 34:05.460]  I was just puffing on it.
[34:05.460 --> 34:08.900]  Like it's kind of wanting a cigarette and puffing on it too much.
[34:08.900 --> 34:11.940]  And I got up and I went to get something in the whole house,
[34:11.940 --> 34:14.980]  kind of tilted like it was a boat. Yeah. Oh fuck.
[34:16.180 --> 34:17.300]  It's good. Got the wobbles.
[34:17.900 --> 34:21.260]  Those pins can be dangerous. You're just sipping on it and sipping on it.
[34:21.260 --> 34:22.460]  And then suddenly you're like, Oh,
[34:22.460 --> 34:25.220]  I have been sipping on it and it's gone and I'm wrecked.
[34:26.060 --> 34:28.980]  And I think your lungs kind of get used to the pen you're hitting too.
[34:29.740 --> 34:31.620]  They get used to the turf set up.
[34:32.660 --> 34:33.500]  That makes sense.
[34:34.820 --> 34:38.220]  I mean, when I first started hitting it, I could hit it kind of,
[34:38.220 --> 34:40.380]  but I'd cough a little if I hit it harder.
[34:40.820 --> 34:42.660]  And by the time I was ready to kill it,
[34:42.660 --> 34:46.300]  I could sit there and rip on it till the light flashed at me and then tap the
[34:46.300 --> 34:49.020]  light a couple of times or button a couple of times and hit it harder.
[34:49.060 --> 34:50.060]  Get that second pool.
[34:52.260 --> 34:54.260]  Yeah. The pins come in handy. They're not my favorite,
[34:54.260 --> 34:55.660]  but they do come in really handy.
[34:56.460 --> 34:58.820]  Grape Cola was tasty. It's got me all chattery.
[34:59.140 --> 35:01.140]  You're almost sweaty. I could see you sweating from the dab.
[35:01.140 --> 35:02.820]  I saw you pull off the hat and it's fucking awesome.
[35:03.180 --> 35:04.340]  Yeah. It got warmer in here.
[35:04.660 --> 35:07.900]  I've noticed that since my, uh, and I don't try to be that guy.
[35:07.900 --> 35:10.020]  That's like, I've changed my diet. I'm amazingly healthy.
[35:10.180 --> 35:12.060]  You guys eat what you want, fucking enjoy life.
[35:12.060 --> 35:14.940]  But I have chosen to minimize my diet. I had a birthday recently.
[35:14.940 --> 35:17.660]  I had a lot of things, uh, encouraged me to change my diet.
[35:18.020 --> 35:20.260]  I'm healthy and everything's cool. I just wanted to be healthier.
[35:20.700 --> 35:22.820]  I haven't had, I haven't, if you know me, you know,
[35:22.820 --> 35:24.380]  that I was a Dr. Pepper fanatic.
[35:24.380 --> 35:28.540]  I haven't had a Dr. Pepper since Valentine's day and it is now four 20.
[35:29.020 --> 35:32.100]  So yeah, it was two days before Valentine's day. It was my last Dr. Pepper,
[35:32.660 --> 35:37.260]  but dude, I get so lit sometimes now because I'm not doing the,
[35:37.460 --> 35:41.380]  I'm not doing the caffeine up and dabs back down and caffeine up and dabs back
[35:41.380 --> 35:45.420]  down. Now it's normal day, normal day jobs. Holy shit.
[35:45.740 --> 35:49.620]  And he was like, Oh, whoa, thank you. Dabs. Like they really get me.
[35:49.780 --> 35:53.820]  So I've noticed. And, uh, since I've cut out all the sugary stuff,
[35:53.820 --> 35:58.740]  I'm not eating cookies and no donuts and shit like that. Food tastes so good.
[35:59.140 --> 36:02.340]  Food tastes better. And I can taste my concentrates better too. Like I'm not,
[36:02.500 --> 36:05.980]  I'm not having syrup tongue or whatever I was getting from the Dr. Pepper and all
[36:05.980 --> 36:06.820]  the sugary crap.
[36:07.220 --> 36:09.620]  Yeah. I have to relearn food now that I don't smoke.
[36:10.020 --> 36:11.140]  Everything fucking tastes weird.
[36:11.300 --> 36:15.500]  I bet that dude, it doesn't all taste like muted cigarettes.
[36:15.980 --> 36:16.820]  Yeah.
[36:17.260 --> 36:20.140]  I do miss hanging out on the porch with you when you would smoke a cigarette
[36:20.140 --> 36:20.980]  though. That's kind of weird.
[36:21.780 --> 36:23.340]  I kind of miss my outside time too.
[36:23.500 --> 36:25.620]  And there's no reason to just go out on the porch and be weird now.
[36:26.300 --> 36:29.180]  Yep. I, uh, I stand out back with my bong every now and again.
[36:29.860 --> 36:33.980]  See, I'm not comfortable in my neighborhood with my new neighbors and I'm not
[36:33.980 --> 36:36.660]  comfortable dabbing on the porch. I'll sit out there and smoke a joint,
[36:36.700 --> 36:39.940]  but I'm not down with the dab rig and the torch on the porch.
[36:39.980 --> 36:41.780]  Torch on the porch is our other band name.
[36:42.220 --> 36:43.060]  Uh,
[36:44.300 --> 36:48.340]  two guys coughing and torch on a porch is our first record. Yeah,
[36:48.340 --> 36:49.100]  I'm not comfortable.
[36:49.100 --> 36:52.100]  Of ours used to have a house like,
[36:53.660 --> 36:56.540]  it's going to sound like a weird way to say it,
[36:56.540 --> 37:00.100]  but it's like a major side street. Um,
[37:00.220 --> 37:02.820]  it's not meant to be a main artery through our town, but it,
[37:03.340 --> 37:07.980]  it's the main way people get from one side of town to the other. And, uh,
[37:08.820 --> 37:12.380]  I mean, steady traffic, it's, it's only one lane each way.
[37:12.380 --> 37:16.020]  But if you sat out there all day, you'd always have a car in front of you.
[37:16.020 --> 37:19.420]  Maybe get to two or three minute gap with no traffic,
[37:19.420 --> 37:23.020]  but usually it's a steady stream just out there fucking dabbing,
[37:23.020 --> 37:25.460]  using a propane torch to hit the fucking nail.
[37:28.380 --> 37:29.700]  Yeah. That makes you look different.
[37:29.940 --> 37:31.260]  So crack heady, but yeah.
[37:32.140 --> 37:33.420]  You guys get it. Go get a torch,
[37:33.460 --> 37:36.420]  go get a vector torch or a special blue double dragon torch.
[37:37.220 --> 37:38.940]  Get yourself a non crackhead torch.
[37:39.260 --> 37:43.980]  I got a, like a $35 torch from bed, bath and beyond. Bitch works great.
[37:44.060 --> 37:45.380]  Yeah. It's a little Kimberley torch.
[37:45.500 --> 37:47.460]  They last about a year and a half, two years.
[37:47.460 --> 37:50.060]  Then all of a sudden that goes to shit on you. You just go get another one.
[37:50.260 --> 37:51.780]  Yeah. One day it just doesn't work anymore.
[37:51.780 --> 37:54.380]  Of COVID you order another one from the internet.
[37:54.780 --> 37:58.780]  Yeah. Yeah. Good shout out to Amazon for keeping us safe.
[37:59.420 --> 38:00.260]  Yup.
[38:02.780 --> 38:04.540]  Oh, what a time to be alive, homie.
[38:04.700 --> 38:06.060]  The perfect time, dude. Well, it was,
[38:06.380 --> 38:09.820]  it's almost suspicious how perfectly everything was set up for delivery.
[38:09.820 --> 38:11.260]  And then we were all told to stay home,
[38:11.260 --> 38:14.260]  but I am not going to be Eddie Bravo and I'm not going to go that route.
[38:14.620 --> 38:18.860]  I've rem, well, like shit like this happened before.
[38:18.860 --> 38:23.060]  It's just society was substantially less able to, to cope with it. Like,
[38:24.060 --> 38:27.660]  um, but we're so lucky right now.
[38:27.660 --> 38:32.100]  Can you imagine trying to do this in the nineties where there's,
[38:32.140 --> 38:35.660]  you can get food delivery, but it's pizza or Chinese. That's the fucking,
[38:35.700 --> 38:36.540]  that's it.
[38:36.820 --> 38:39.220]  Or some subway submarine sandwich kind of place.
[38:41.020 --> 38:44.380]  Maybe if you're lucky a place that, um,
[38:44.980 --> 38:47.540]  that does like sandwiches or pastas would deliver,
[38:47.540 --> 38:50.820]  but only if you're lucky or live in a major city.
[38:50.820 --> 38:53.820]  Yeah. I was from, I'm from kind of right outside of long beach in California,
[38:53.820 --> 38:56.300]  so we could get some good shit delivered, but not much. You're right.
[38:56.820 --> 38:59.700]  And who knows what it would have been, you know, it could have been really
[39:00.260 --> 39:04.220]  essential. Oh my God. Going there, touch all those videos.
[39:04.660 --> 39:09.100]  You got HBO Showtime, Cinemax and other basic cable channels.
[39:09.100 --> 39:10.620]  If you're lucky enough to have cable.
[39:11.100 --> 39:12.060]  My, my day back then,
[39:12.060 --> 39:16.500]  my TV never really left MTV at Beavis and butt head and fucking headbangers ball
[39:16.500 --> 39:20.060]  and everything you needed was on MTV. Yep. Maybe late at night,
[39:20.220 --> 39:25.140]  put on USA up all night, but try to catch Emanuel on Cinemax, you know,
[39:26.140 --> 39:29.300]  Oh my God. Remember, remember watching the blurry channels.
[39:29.780 --> 39:32.620]  Remember trying to peek through the blurry channel and catch a blue occasionally.
[39:33.780 --> 39:37.860]  Oh man. I had the blurry channels back in the day. Like if you go up past like 50,
[39:38.060 --> 39:39.900]  mom had good cable. Oh dude.
[39:39.900 --> 39:42.740]  I thought it was funny cause the cartoon channel was 50 and then the, uh,
[39:42.780 --> 39:45.660]  the adult channels were 51 up and I was like, well,
[39:45.900 --> 39:47.980]  just go to cartoons and then scroll up one.
[39:47.980 --> 39:50.700]  And I can maybe catch a green boob on the side or something.
[39:51.180 --> 39:53.900]  People that are our age know we're talking about trying to watch unscrambled
[39:53.940 --> 39:57.860]  porn or scrambled porn. That's fucking funny. Weird podcast episode.
[39:57.860 --> 40:00.260]  This is the weirdest, one of the weirdest podcasts we'll ever do. I hope.
[40:00.860 --> 40:02.220]  Happy for 20 listeners.
[40:02.460 --> 40:06.300]  Happy for 20 bro. I got lit off that dab feeling nice and heavily medicated.
[40:08.220 --> 40:10.220]  Yeah. That's a good time to be alive.
[40:10.580 --> 40:13.180]  It is like, can you imagine doing this without dabs?
[40:14.140 --> 40:15.580]  Oh, dude. Black marketer.
[40:16.420 --> 40:20.780]  Oh God. No picking seeds out of it and shit. We'll fucking set it up. No, no.
[40:21.140 --> 40:24.500]  Back in the day used to have, I would need so much equipment.
[40:24.980 --> 40:29.100]  What would we say? 95 I would need a camera, probably the size,
[40:29.100 --> 40:31.660]  at least the size of a shoe box to record this.
[40:31.980 --> 40:36.300]  Then I would need a server probably the size of another shoe box and then 72,000
[40:36.300 --> 40:38.500]  fucking cables to make those two things work. And then
[40:38.740 --> 40:42.580]  listeners, if you want to laugh, go look up a movie called pump up the volume.
[40:43.900 --> 40:46.500]  Yeah, dude. Wow. I love that movie. The fucking seven minutes.
[40:47.100 --> 40:51.020]  First pond, first podcast concept.
[40:51.660 --> 40:55.340]  Yeah. I think it was just like baby podcasting pirate radio.
[40:55.820 --> 40:58.500]  Yeah. Pirate radio. Dude, we should, I should go watch that again.
[40:58.540 --> 41:01.020]  You guys watch that. It's a great movie. It's yeah, it's a really good one.
[41:01.260 --> 41:03.940]  You may or may not be able to pull it up for free on YouTube.
[41:05.620 --> 41:07.380]  There's a cool thing you can do if you know how to do it.
[41:07.380 --> 41:11.780]  If you type in Google docs slash pump up the volume or Google doc slash movies,
[41:11.780 --> 41:14.100]  pump up the volume, you'll find it in somebody's Google drive,
[41:14.500 --> 41:17.260]  Google drives or Google docs. You can find, yeah, there's a way to,
[41:17.260 --> 41:19.180]  I can't think of how to do it right now at the top of my head,
[41:19.180 --> 41:22.300]  but our listeners that are tech savvy are going to, they'll figure it out.
[41:22.460 --> 41:25.940]  You can find other movies in people's Google drives that are open and you can
[41:25.940 --> 41:31.900]  watch it from their drive. I know the future is awesome. Mike.
[41:32.180 --> 41:36.260]  Now I was going to say is now old man. No. Yeah. Yeah, dude. Now all we need,
[41:36.380 --> 41:38.220]  I bought Mike. I'm not trying to say I bought Mike,
[41:38.220 --> 41:41.940]  but we got Mike about about 130 bucks worth of equipment. That's really well.
[41:41.940 --> 41:44.260]  You got the focus, right? That was about a hundred bucks.
[41:44.260 --> 41:47.780]  The Mike was like 40 bucks. I had the laptop, but yeah. Yeah.
[41:47.780 --> 41:49.980]  But like less than 250 bucks worth of gear.
[41:49.980 --> 41:52.580]  We got Mike going and he's on a video chat with me.
[41:52.580 --> 41:55.580]  We're looking at each other face to face like real time. There's no lag.
[41:55.580 --> 41:57.700]  This is fucking awesome. I expected a little bit of delay.
[41:57.700 --> 42:00.660]  There's zero lag happening. It makes it super nice. So yeah,
[42:00.660 --> 42:03.500]  we're in the future. You guys, we didn't get flying cars,
[42:03.500 --> 42:06.700]  but we got the viruses from the movies and we got all the phone shit from the
[42:06.700 --> 42:11.020]  movies. We did not get the flying cars. Um, yeah.
[42:11.660 --> 42:15.180]  At least we got podcasts and shit. Yeah. If I had a flying car,
[42:15.220 --> 42:17.140]  I'm afraid of flying cars in our neighborhood, bro.
[42:17.140 --> 42:19.900]  People would be falling from the sky, running out of gas on the way to work.
[42:22.300 --> 42:25.740]  Not a lot of people down here can afford a car that flies. Exactly. Yeah.
[42:25.740 --> 42:28.820]  So it'd just be the one dimensional travel. Then a few of us would just be
[42:29.980 --> 42:32.300]  zipping above looking like an asshole. It wouldn't be cool.
[42:33.180 --> 42:35.700]  Where would you find my flying car? My backyard.
[42:37.700 --> 42:38.980]  All right. Um, Mike,
[42:39.260 --> 42:41.980]  we have been going for long enough to where I think we should start wrapping
[42:41.980 --> 42:44.420]  this up cause we're getting way off topic, but it's been fun.
[42:44.420 --> 42:46.420]  I want to make sure that we've got a successful show.

[45:03.060 --> 45:03.900]  Woo.
[45:07.820 --> 45:11.060]  Sometime the things you need in life may be difficult.
[45:11.060 --> 45:13.380]  Not all the time. It's gonna be easy.
[45:13.700 --> 45:16.460]  I saw we go smoke the marijuana and get
[45:18.060 --> 45:19.820]  stay above the week kids and
[45:22.060 --> 45:24.940]  I'm feeling so very good about myself.
[45:24.940 --> 45:28.300]  Babylon ain't feeling good. Damn. That's the problem.
[45:28.300 --> 45:29.780]  I smoke the marijuana.
[45:29.980 --> 45:30.580]  Get
[45:32.580 --> 45:33.620]  the week kids and
[45:37.660 --> 45:38.500]  domestic.
[45:39.540 --> 45:40.820]  My girl, she just
[45:42.660 --> 45:43.660]  the marijuana.
[45:45.700 --> 45:47.260]  Stay. I bummed out. We kids.
[45:49.500 --> 45:52.740]  Love is the order of the day. You better find it.
[45:53.180 --> 45:57.980]  I'm a big man. I put my problems behind me. I smoke the marijuana and get
[45:57.980 --> 46:01.340]  the week kids and
[46:04.940 --> 46:06.700]  confident in myself.
[46:06.700 --> 46:09.980]  There's nothing that could get to me.
[46:09.980 --> 46:12.100]  Not even the damn system.
[46:12.100 --> 46:14.180]  So this is a problem right now.
[46:14.180 --> 46:16.940]  I'm very un-terrified living happily.
[46:17.300 --> 46:19.940]  It goes Babylonians mess with us today.
[46:19.940 --> 46:23.380]  The music I play and smoke my problems away.
[46:24.260 --> 46:27.380]  A couple of my friends were just chilling on the corner
[46:27.740 --> 46:30.900]  listening to the music from Jamaica to Bahamas.
[46:31.140 --> 46:34.060]  Yeah, we decided to go link the farm.
[46:34.060 --> 46:36.140]  I need something for the brain.
[46:36.140 --> 46:37.980]  It's the marijuana.
[46:37.980 --> 46:40.900]  I PS a lot when the good vibes stir up.
[46:41.060 --> 46:44.300]  When the chanting starts, you get very few corrupt.
[46:44.300 --> 46:48.500]  We smoke all day and still we got the herbs I rub up.
[46:48.780 --> 46:51.220]  Don't say Babylonian rub.
[46:51.220 --> 46:53.140]  We give thanks for the spirit.
[46:53.140 --> 46:55.300]  Keep the meditation.
[46:55.300 --> 46:56.940]  Music and more music.
[46:56.940 --> 46:58.620]  We burn the vagrants.
[46:58.620 --> 47:01.140]  No, if not, but no argument.
[47:01.420 --> 47:05.300]  Marijuana is my only sacrament.
[47:05.580 --> 47:07.700]  I smoke the marijuana and get
[47:09.220 --> 47:11.020]  stay above the week kids and
[47:12.740 --> 47:16.100]  smoke the marijuana and get high.
[47:16.140 --> 47:17.580]  Give thanks and praise.
[47:17.620 --> 47:22.100]  I desire all when Babylonians going down
[47:22.340 --> 47:25.580]  rest a month, still request a hundred pound
[47:25.940 --> 47:28.980]  blizzard, the sun will pass it around.
[47:29.220 --> 47:32.900]  And if I'm a by myself, I'll just smoke it alone.
[47:33.100 --> 47:34.620]  We got this phone to make it.
[47:34.620 --> 47:35.340]  Don't get me.
[47:35.340 --> 47:35.900]  You're rocking.
[47:35.900 --> 47:36.700]  Makes you bounce.
[47:36.700 --> 47:37.700]  We got the diesel.
[47:37.700 --> 47:38.380]  The diesel.
[47:38.380 --> 47:40.140]  We got enough for the people.
[47:40.140 --> 47:41.900]  We got the hydro to rise.
[47:41.900 --> 47:43.900]  Your smoke can get wiser.
[47:44.180 --> 47:46.540]  Charlie's off a blade smoking.
[47:46.540 --> 47:47.980]  Purple smoke.
[47:47.980 --> 47:49.500]  The marijuana on the.
[47:51.060 --> 47:53.620]  Stay above the week kids and fly.
[47:54.700 --> 47:57.980]  Sometimes the things I need in life may be difficult.
[47:57.980 --> 47:58.980]  Not all the time.
[47:58.980 --> 48:00.580]  It's going to be easy.
[48:00.580 --> 48:03.500]  I saw we go smoke the marijuana and get
[48:05.020 --> 48:07.420]  stay above the week kids and fly.
[48:09.060 --> 48:12.140]  I'm feeling so very good about myself.
[48:12.340 --> 48:13.780]  Big and feeling good.
[48:13.780 --> 48:15.460]  Well, that's the problem.
[48:15.460 --> 48:16.940]  I smoke the marijuana.
[48:16.940 --> 48:17.540]  I'm just
[48:18.980 --> 48:20.780]  still you're going to be kids and.
[48:22.780 --> 48:26.140]  I went to a problem at home domestically
[48:26.540 --> 48:29.460]  and my lady just wanna quarrel with me.
[48:29.460 --> 48:30.940]  I smoke the marijuana.
[48:30.940 --> 48:31.460]  I'm just
[48:32.980 --> 48:34.780]  still you're going to be kids and.
[48:37.020 --> 48:40.140]  Love is the day you gotta find it.
[48:40.460 --> 48:41.460]  I'm a big man.
[48:41.460 --> 48:42.620]  I'm a problem.
[48:42.620 --> 48:45.620]  The idea is to the marijuana and get.
