[01:28.620 --> 01:34.880]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:34.880 --> 01:38.460]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen and you know I do include a
[01:38.460 --> 01:45.060]  link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:45.060 --> 01:48.940]  I do want to start the show by saying wow I apologize for going through that intro super
[01:48.940 --> 01:49.940]  fast.
[01:49.940 --> 01:55.540]  I smoked a strain, some flowers of a strain called Jack Tripper and it's got me going
[01:55.540 --> 01:56.540]  super fast.
[01:56.540 --> 02:00.540]  Hopefully I can calm down and get this together but my brain is speeding through it.
[02:00.540 --> 02:05.740]  Jack Tripper is a cross of it is Lemon Skunk and Jack the Ripper.
[02:05.740 --> 02:11.660]  It's got a flavor of lemon candy and spiciness and some dryer sheets in it.
[02:11.660 --> 02:14.940]  My favorite part is that it has just got my brain spinning.
[02:14.940 --> 02:16.420]  I'm going super fast in here.
[02:16.420 --> 02:21.900]  Also something I noticed most of the time when I smoke flowers my mouth gets super dry.
[02:21.900 --> 02:26.080]  My mouth, my throat, my nose, my eyes, I get that dry cotton mouth feeling that just crusty
[02:26.080 --> 02:28.140]  eye feeling from smoking so much flower.
[02:28.140 --> 02:31.340]  I do not have that feeling at all from these flowers.
[02:31.340 --> 02:32.420]  It is quite the opposite.
[02:32.420 --> 02:34.380]  My mouth feels not to sound kind of gross.
[02:34.380 --> 02:36.420]  I got juicy mouth from smoking those flowers.
[02:36.420 --> 02:43.100]  It tasted so good that my mouth is like watering thinking about the lemon candy flowery spicy
[02:43.100 --> 02:44.180]  flavors that came from it.
[02:44.180 --> 02:46.140]  It's like lemon candy bubble gum dryer sheets.
[02:46.140 --> 02:48.580]  There's a lot of stuff lingering on my tongue right now.
[02:48.580 --> 02:49.820]  I really enjoy it.
[02:49.820 --> 02:54.080]  I'm going to try to keep myself together and do a good podcast for you but heads up I was
[02:54.080 --> 02:55.620]  smoking some good shit today.
[02:55.620 --> 02:56.620]  Alright let's jump right into it.
[02:56.620 --> 03:00.860]  I don't want to ramble too much because that is definitely a possibility in this episode.
[03:00.860 --> 03:05.060]  I did say at the beginning of the show that we were going to talk about pesticide drift
[03:05.060 --> 03:06.380]  in our outdoor gardens.
[03:06.380 --> 03:08.460]  We are wrapping up the outdoor season.
[03:08.460 --> 03:11.700]  Most folks in the United States have wrapped up their outdoor grow season.
[03:11.700 --> 03:15.300]  If you have not wrapped up you are a savage or a maniac good luck.
[03:15.300 --> 03:17.780]  But many people have wrapped up their outdoor grows.
[03:17.780 --> 03:22.100]  A lot of people have gotten their outdoor grows tested by a lab facility.
[03:22.100 --> 03:26.560]  We're testing for potency and we're testing for terpene content.
[03:26.560 --> 03:28.700]  Also we're testing for contamination.
[03:28.700 --> 03:32.660]  We're testing for heavy metals and the presence of pesticides.
[03:32.660 --> 03:34.500]  We're making some weird discoveries.
[03:34.500 --> 03:39.260]  I was having this conversation with some friends in a discord server and then just after that
[03:39.260 --> 03:40.680]  we had some flowers.
[03:40.680 --> 03:43.880]  Not any of my flowers but a friend another person that I associate with an outdoor grow
[03:43.880 --> 03:45.520]  I was checking out a lot.
[03:45.520 --> 03:49.700]  They discovered that some of their flowers are testing hot for pesticide exposure.
[03:49.700 --> 03:54.380]  Now how is this happening because the people I'm talking about never used any spray applications
[03:54.380 --> 03:59.040]  in their garden especially the products that they are being tested positive for.
[03:59.040 --> 04:00.500]  So they're saying how did this happen.
[04:00.500 --> 04:03.300]  There's only one solution that I could come up with.
[04:03.300 --> 04:08.260]  Somebody a neighboring garden must have been applying illegal pesticides or pesticides
[04:08.260 --> 04:11.660]  that were drifting into our friend's garden.
[04:11.660 --> 04:13.240]  Now that is really important to think about.
[04:13.240 --> 04:15.840]  Are you applying a pesticide and this only works for an outdoor garden.
[04:15.840 --> 04:18.140]  If you're applying indoors that shit's stuck indoors.
[04:18.140 --> 04:19.140]  You be very careful.
[04:19.140 --> 04:23.040]  Think about where you're exhausting to but for the most part you're just spraying indoors.
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.040]  Outdoors.
[04:24.700 --> 04:28.780]  So if you're using a three by three plot of land that is yours and the neighbors are sharing
[04:28.780 --> 04:33.180]  that land on the other side of that imaginary fence that imaginary borderline it is still
[04:33.180 --> 04:37.260]  your responsibility if you've got acres and acres that is still your responsibility to
[04:37.260 --> 04:40.420]  control the products that you apply to your garden.
[04:40.420 --> 04:45.620]  If they drift and travel outward it is our responsibility to be responsible pesticide
[04:45.620 --> 04:46.620]  applicators.
[04:46.620 --> 04:49.940]  If you've been trained by the Department of Ag if you've taken any training classes if
[04:49.940 --> 04:53.580]  you're certified you probably understand the importance of pesticide drift.
[04:54.120 --> 04:55.560]  Many people may not understand that.
[04:55.560 --> 04:58.120]  So we were talking about it and there were a lot of things that came to my mind and I
[04:58.120 --> 05:00.680]  thought we could do a good podcast about it.
[05:00.680 --> 05:03.360]  So did your neighbor contaminate your grow.
[05:03.360 --> 05:05.760]  Did you contaminate your neighbors grow.
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.240]  Were the first two questions that I wrote in my notes.
[05:09.240 --> 05:11.720]  Pesticide can drift when you are spraying stuff.
[05:11.720 --> 05:14.200]  If it is windy it can travel to the grow next door.
[05:14.200 --> 05:17.580]  It can travel every direction it can travel whichever direction the wind is going.
[05:17.580 --> 05:19.720]  So let's be careful when we're applying.
[05:19.720 --> 05:21.880]  Now this doesn't only count in cannabis crops.
[05:21.880 --> 05:25.980]  You may have neighbors that are using you may have a fruit and vegetable crop next door.
[05:25.980 --> 05:27.740]  You may have a hemp crop you may have.
[05:27.740 --> 05:30.260]  They may have a pumpkin patch coming up right next door.
[05:30.260 --> 05:32.300]  Think about what they're spraying what they're using.
[05:32.300 --> 05:34.740]  Think about what you're spraying and what you are using.
[05:34.740 --> 05:39.600]  Is it going to have detrimental effects on either side of the fence possibly four sides
[05:39.600 --> 05:40.600]  of the fence.
[05:40.600 --> 05:41.880]  Maybe you got people all around you.
[05:41.880 --> 05:45.260]  That means you got at least four people to think about other than yourself when it comes
[05:45.260 --> 05:47.340]  to pesticide applications.
[05:47.340 --> 05:48.340]  Let's be good neighbors.
[05:48.340 --> 05:50.020]  Let's be a good community.
[05:50.020 --> 05:53.640]  We're growing cannabis and a lot of people already have a little bit of a stigma for us.
[05:53.640 --> 05:58.560]  A lot of people were programmed and trained that reefer madness cannabis is the devil.
[05:58.560 --> 06:02.320]  We're going to smoke a smoke a little bit of weed and start raping ladies and committing
[06:02.320 --> 06:04.560]  crimes and doing all the worst shit you could think of.
[06:04.560 --> 06:06.140]  We're going to become the devil.
[06:06.140 --> 06:08.460]  It doesn't happen that way but they think that.
[06:08.460 --> 06:10.280]  So let's try to be good neighbors.
[06:10.280 --> 06:13.440]  We're growing cannabis right next door to people that may be afraid of us.
[06:13.440 --> 06:14.440]  Let's be good neighbors.
[06:14.440 --> 06:18.480]  Let's not destroy their crops because that is one more thing to make them hate team cannabis.
[06:18.480 --> 06:19.560]  Let's try to be their friends.
[06:19.600 --> 06:22.300]  We'll talk more about that a little bit here in the future.
[06:22.300 --> 06:24.700]  So are you spraying your neighbors?
[06:24.700 --> 06:28.620]  And another thing to think about are your neighbors spraying or treating and sending
[06:28.620 --> 06:30.900]  their pests your way?
[06:30.900 --> 06:35.500]  When you spray for a pest or treat for a pest or a problem, especially like if you got spider
[06:35.500 --> 06:37.660]  mites or something like that, I'm just going to pick spider mites.
[06:37.660 --> 06:41.420]  If you spray for spider mites outdoors, they're going that way and that way.
[06:41.420 --> 06:45.140]  And if your neighbors didn't spray for spider mites, they're going to get spider mites.
[06:45.140 --> 06:48.420]  If you don't treat for spider mites in some sort of way, maybe you sprayed, maybe you
[06:48.440 --> 06:52.240]  got predators, maybe you got some sort of electromagnetical mind control that you can
[06:52.240 --> 06:53.680]  use to control spider mites.
[06:53.680 --> 06:57.160]  When one of you treats for bugs, the bugs are going to go to the other yard.
[06:57.160 --> 06:59.840]  They're just going to say, oh, this guy sprayed for spider mites.
[06:59.840 --> 07:00.840]  Let's just climb the fence.
[07:00.840 --> 07:02.920]  There's no fence or spider mites or microscopic.
[07:02.920 --> 07:03.920]  They're just going to travel South.
[07:03.920 --> 07:06.920]  They're going to go to the next garden right over there because that person didn't treat
[07:06.920 --> 07:08.500]  for bugs, didn't treat for spider mites.
[07:08.500 --> 07:11.560]  So if one of you is treating and one of you isn't, they're just going to move around.
[07:11.560 --> 07:14.840]  And then when your treatment wears off or your spray wears off, they're going to go
[07:14.840 --> 07:15.840]  to the other garden.
[07:15.840 --> 07:16.840]  And then the other guy is going to spray.
[07:16.980 --> 07:18.380]  They're going to keep traveling around.
[07:18.380 --> 07:22.180]  A great way to prevent this would be farmer unity.
[07:22.180 --> 07:23.780]  Why not go and meet your neighbors?
[07:23.780 --> 07:28.780]  Why not go and talk to each person around you growing and see how you are handling pests?
[07:28.780 --> 07:31.700]  I'm sure that in a lot of agricultural areas, there are meetings.
[07:31.700 --> 07:33.100]  People have town meetings.
[07:33.100 --> 07:34.380]  People get together in small towns.
[07:34.380 --> 07:37.100]  They like to gather and meet maybe at church, maybe somewhere like that.
[07:37.100 --> 07:38.100]  Bring it up.
[07:38.100 --> 07:39.340]  Say, hey, are you guys treating?
[07:39.340 --> 07:41.220]  There's nothing stopping you from going and knocking on the door.
[07:41.220 --> 07:42.220]  I know maybe there is.
[07:42.220 --> 07:44.180]  I don't know your situation.
[07:44.180 --> 07:45.180]  Farmers are different.
[07:45.180 --> 07:46.180]  I don't have a lot.
[07:46.520 --> 07:48.280]  I don't have a lot of farm life experience.
[07:48.280 --> 07:49.280]  I'm a city boy.
[07:49.280 --> 07:50.280]  I'm an indoor grower.
[07:50.280 --> 07:53.200]  I actually contacted a farmer friend and I said, hey, is there a protocol for this?
[07:53.200 --> 07:54.400]  And he said, not really.
[07:54.400 --> 07:57.920]  So I guess the thing to do would be to go knock on their door or send them a letter
[07:57.920 --> 07:59.360]  or contact them some way.
[07:59.360 --> 08:00.360]  They're people.
[08:00.360 --> 08:03.160]  They're facing the same challenges as you possibly.
[08:03.160 --> 08:06.840]  If you went over there and said, hey, last year I got hit with spider mites real bad
[08:06.840 --> 08:08.200]  around this time of the year.
[08:08.200 --> 08:09.200]  Did you notice that as well?
[08:09.200 --> 08:10.600]  And they're going to go, well, holy shit, so did I.
[08:10.600 --> 08:14.600]  And you're going to go, well, this year I'm going to do this to treat the spider mites.
[08:14.600 --> 08:16.000]  What are you going to do?
[08:16.020 --> 08:17.020]  And they can say, well, that was your treatment.
[08:17.020 --> 08:18.020]  It was a good idea.
[08:18.020 --> 08:21.540]  Or maybe they'll say, you know, my grandpappy taught me that for 20 years we did this and
[08:21.540 --> 08:22.540]  it worked.
[08:22.540 --> 08:23.540]  You might learn some shit.
[08:23.540 --> 08:24.540]  You might teach some shit.
[08:24.540 --> 08:25.620]  So don't be afraid to make contact.
[08:25.620 --> 08:29.300]  Go over there, establish some friendships, build a relationship, see what you guys are
[08:29.300 --> 08:30.820]  doing and work together.
[08:30.820 --> 08:35.140]  If not, like I said, you could just be passing those problems from farm to farm to farm.
[08:35.140 --> 08:38.420]  If you've got, think about if you've got four farms meeting at a corner, you've got the
[08:38.420 --> 08:39.420]  four corners.
[08:39.420 --> 08:43.260]  They're going to go from plot A to plot B to plot C to plot D just in a circle, just
[08:43.260 --> 08:44.900]  going to rotate if you guys don't do something.
[08:44.900 --> 08:48.720]  If you guys all team up, you'll kill all the pests, all the problems work together.
[08:48.720 --> 08:50.440]  You can all have successful outcomes.
[08:50.440 --> 08:54.280]  Then if one guy's growing corn and one guy's growing soybeans and one guy's growing something
[08:54.280 --> 08:58.480]  else and you're growing weed, you're going to have free coin, free corn, free soybeans,
[08:58.480 --> 09:01.240]  free tomatoes all year because you guys teamed up and helped each other out.
[09:01.240 --> 09:03.160]  Then he got some new smoking buddies.
[09:03.160 --> 09:04.160]  Things should work.
[09:04.160 --> 09:05.160]  Unity is the way to do it.
[09:05.160 --> 09:08.800]  You guys know when it does come to treating outdoors for our pests and preventing for
[09:08.800 --> 09:14.520]  pests, my favorite and most recommended method would be the use of predator insects.
[09:14.620 --> 09:18.460]  I personally am not, I said this before, I'm not experienced and well-versed in outdoor
[09:18.460 --> 09:19.460]  growing.
[09:19.460 --> 09:20.700]  I've done a little bit of greenhouse growing.
[09:20.700 --> 09:24.600]  I've done some help in outdoor farms, but I've never been in charge of an outdoor grow.
[09:24.600 --> 09:28.340]  To the best of my knowledge, from what I've seen, I think that predator bugs would be
[09:28.340 --> 09:31.940]  the most useful avenue and mode of attack.
[09:31.940 --> 09:33.900]  I personally, maybe I'm a big old hippie.
[09:33.900 --> 09:36.720]  I don't want to go spray a bunch of stuff outside.
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.760]  Not only am I going to spray the plants I'm intending to spray, but also possibly I may
[09:40.860 --> 09:42.940]  over spray and spray the crop next door.
[09:42.940 --> 09:46.900]  That will result in my friends, my neighbors having a pesticide exposure they were not
[09:46.900 --> 09:48.040]  looking for.
[09:48.040 --> 09:52.580]  If I'm growing one product and they're growing another and I sprayed over here, maybe the
[09:52.580 --> 09:55.840]  product I'm spraying is not allowed to be sprayed on their product.
[09:55.840 --> 09:58.660]  Maybe the product they're spraying isn't allowed on my product.
[09:58.660 --> 10:01.860]  Now we're going to contaminate each other's product and it has to be destroyed and we
[10:01.860 --> 10:03.860]  lose our product for the year.
[10:03.860 --> 10:06.540]  My favorite option would be the predator bugs.
[10:06.540 --> 10:09.020]  Also when you spray stuff, what else are you destroying?
[10:09.020 --> 10:10.260]  You're not just hitting your plants.
[10:10.260 --> 10:11.660]  You're hitting the soil.
[10:11.660 --> 10:13.280]  You're hitting everything around.
[10:13.280 --> 10:17.320]  Then if any wildlife passes through, you're getting that wildlife also, which we may want
[10:17.320 --> 10:19.920]  to keep the wildlife away, but you should have built a fence or whatever for that.
[10:19.920 --> 10:23.080]  We don't need to get animals, bunnies, shit like that sick.
[10:23.080 --> 10:24.680]  Let's talk about the bunnies and the chickens.
[10:24.680 --> 10:27.320]  Let's learn to use those sorts of things to our advantage.
[10:27.320 --> 10:30.000]  The chickens are around eating all the small jumping critters.
[10:30.000 --> 10:31.320]  I don't know what the bunnies do.
[10:31.320 --> 10:36.280]  Like I said, I'm not a farm guy, but let's learn to use our natural buddies, the chickens
[10:36.280 --> 10:39.440]  and things like that to our advantage to help take care of that grow.
[10:39.620 --> 10:40.700]  Maybe let some chickens out there.
[10:40.700 --> 10:43.840]  Maybe one of your farmer friends already has a bunch of chickens next door.
[10:43.840 --> 10:46.700]  Maybe bring them chickens through your crops to eat all those grasshoppers that are trying
[10:46.700 --> 10:47.740]  to take over.
[10:47.740 --> 10:51.440]  Like I'm saying, if we use our resources and team up together, we could definitely make
[10:51.440 --> 10:52.600]  things better.
[10:52.600 --> 10:55.140]  This applies, side rant hippie talk.
[10:55.140 --> 10:56.260]  I told you I'm high.
[10:56.260 --> 10:59.180]  This applies to just about everything in life.
[10:59.180 --> 11:01.260]  If we talk to the people around us and say, what's your goal?
[11:01.260 --> 11:02.700]  What are we trying to do?
[11:02.700 --> 11:06.060]  Instead of just doing it all on our own and trying to fucking do everything, maybe the
[11:06.060 --> 11:09.420]  person next to us has a goal that lines up with ours and we can help each other out and
[11:09.420 --> 11:13.640]  we can all get there together and not leave people behind, not fucking fail because we
[11:13.640 --> 11:14.700]  didn't ask for help.
[11:14.700 --> 11:16.040]  This works with everything in life.
[11:16.040 --> 11:17.460]  Team up with the people around you.
[11:17.460 --> 11:18.980]  See who's got similar goals.
[11:18.980 --> 11:20.820]  See who has similar things in mind.
[11:20.820 --> 11:22.740]  Let's work together and get each other where we want to be.
[11:22.740 --> 11:23.740]  That way nobody struggles.
[11:23.740 --> 11:24.980]  It's all a community.
[11:24.980 --> 11:26.840]  The community can be a community again.
[11:26.840 --> 11:29.360]  All the isolation, all the quarantine, that's coming to an end.
[11:29.360 --> 11:30.360]  Let's be friends.
[11:30.360 --> 11:31.680]  Let's be community again.
[11:31.680 --> 11:34.400]  Let's get together, try to love one another and feel all right.
[11:34.400 --> 11:37.320]  You guys, I'm telling you that Jack Tripper is some good shit.
[11:37.320 --> 11:40.460]  Now let me segue into, I wrote down protect the land.
[11:40.460 --> 11:43.680]  It sounds like hippie shit, but it is all of our responsibility.
[11:43.680 --> 11:45.500]  That land is yours.
[11:45.500 --> 11:47.180]  Maybe that portion of land is your land.
[11:47.180 --> 11:48.180]  This land is my land.
[11:48.180 --> 11:49.180]  But guess what?
[11:49.180 --> 11:51.260]  For now in the future, you're going to die.
[11:51.260 --> 11:52.460]  I'm going to die.
[11:52.460 --> 11:54.500]  People are going to have to live on that land after us.
[11:54.500 --> 11:55.860]  I've got a child.
[11:55.860 --> 11:59.060]  She hopefully one day, not too far, not too fucking soon.
[11:59.060 --> 12:00.180]  Settle down kid.
[12:00.180 --> 12:02.040]  Hopefully she has children one day.
[12:02.040 --> 12:03.260]  Hopefully those children have children.
[12:03.260 --> 12:06.780]  We need safe, healthy, viable land for all of our children.
[12:07.240 --> 12:12.040]  It's our responsibility now to make sure that that land is healthy when our children's children's
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.120]  children's are there to play in that dirt, to grow their food, to grow their ganja in
[12:16.120 --> 12:17.120]  that dirt.
[12:17.120 --> 12:18.320]  Also protect the water.
[12:18.320 --> 12:21.040]  I know that's just a side rant, but protect the water.
[12:21.040 --> 12:25.440]  If you are growing a cannabis, it is your responsibility to protect the land and the
[12:25.440 --> 12:27.360]  water around your grow.
[12:27.360 --> 12:28.360]  Think about it.
[12:28.360 --> 12:30.640]  Like I said about the land, that's not ours forever.
[12:30.640 --> 12:31.720]  That water is moving.
[12:31.720 --> 12:35.680]  That water is yours and that section, but it's traveling downstream and taking all the
[12:35.940 --> 12:40.420]  destruction, the contamination, the pollution, the bad vibes that you're doing to it.
[12:40.420 --> 12:41.940]  It's traveling downstream.
[12:41.940 --> 12:43.540]  Quit doing that shit to the people downstream.
[12:43.540 --> 12:44.780]  Be a good person.
[12:44.780 --> 12:46.180]  Love the water, love the land.
[12:46.180 --> 12:47.180]  It will love you back.
[12:47.180 --> 12:49.780]  I do believe that it will take care of you if you love it back.
[12:49.780 --> 12:53.420]  Now this does work us into a little bit of a recap.
[12:53.420 --> 12:56.060]  Previously I've done an episode about bud washing.
[12:56.060 --> 13:00.820]  Somebody asked me, will bud washing help with the pesticide situation?
[13:00.820 --> 13:01.820]  Possibly maybe.
[13:01.820 --> 13:06.600]  It depends on what pesticide was applied to the flower and what stage, how strong.
[13:06.600 --> 13:09.360]  There are a lot of contributing factors here.
[13:09.360 --> 13:12.400]  Was it just a surface application is what I want to call it.
[13:12.400 --> 13:16.200]  If you applied some sort of oil, some hippie oil, that just landed on the surface of the
[13:16.200 --> 13:21.880]  leaf and made that plant undesirable for attacking pests or maybe a pathogen.
[13:21.880 --> 13:26.640]  If you applied something systemic that got inside of the plant, there is no washing that
[13:26.640 --> 13:27.640]  out.
[13:27.640 --> 13:30.560]  A product like floramite or avid, that's inside of your plant.
[13:30.560 --> 13:31.600]  You can't wash that out.
[13:32.380 --> 13:33.380]  It's moving around.
[13:33.380 --> 13:34.380]  It's in the cellular part of the plant.
[13:34.380 --> 13:35.980]  There's no getting rid of that.
[13:35.980 --> 13:38.060]  That bud is going to test positive for that.
[13:38.060 --> 13:42.500]  Whatever the main ingredient that is, it will test positive for that no matter what you
[13:42.500 --> 13:44.380]  do even with a bud wash.
[13:44.380 --> 13:47.580]  So bud washing will take off your powdery mildew, your bug poop.
[13:47.580 --> 13:52.740]  It may take off some of your lighter surface sprayed type products, but your systemic stuff
[13:52.740 --> 13:55.500]  is inside of that plant and you cannot get rid of it.
[13:55.500 --> 14:00.900]  So bud washing may help with some things, but it's not going to get rid of every pesticide
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  that you used.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.560]  Now, one more thing to talk about when it comes to protecting our outdoor grows and
[14:05.560 --> 14:08.560]  taking care of our neighbors is pollen.
[14:08.560 --> 14:13.520]  I see a lot of people growing outdoors in the city, in the country, on farmland, in
[14:13.520 --> 14:15.040]  urban areas.
[14:15.040 --> 14:17.720]  Be very careful with your male plants.
[14:17.720 --> 14:21.880]  If you've got a male plant outside and it starts to drop pollen, the wind will take
[14:21.880 --> 14:23.880]  that pollen for miles.
[14:23.880 --> 14:26.520]  It can go a long way depending on what's in the way.
[14:26.520 --> 14:29.440]  If you're in the city, if you've got a big city, I've got buildings and houses and trees
[14:29.460 --> 14:32.740]  and shit here that may block some of that pollen from getting places.
[14:32.740 --> 14:37.060]  But if you're in a flat landed area with not a lot of shit, that pollen is going to travel
[14:37.060 --> 14:39.020]  and it could go quite a ways.
[14:39.020 --> 14:40.780]  It could go very far.
[14:40.780 --> 14:42.660]  There are stories of pollen traveling miles.
[14:42.660 --> 14:46.540]  I don't know how true or real that is, but there are legends and stories of pollen moving
[14:46.540 --> 14:47.860]  for miles.
[14:47.860 --> 14:49.060]  So it can go a ways.
[14:49.060 --> 14:51.700]  It can go quite a distance, at least a quarter mile.
[14:51.700 --> 14:52.700]  So be very careful.
[14:52.700 --> 14:56.240]  If you're growing outdoors, pay very close attention to your plants.
[14:56.240 --> 14:57.240]  Look for males.
[14:57.240 --> 14:58.980]  Get rid of those males very early.
[14:59.020 --> 15:01.920]  If you're going to do any breeding outdoors, be very careful.
[15:01.920 --> 15:04.320]  Really consider how far that pollen will travel.
[15:04.320 --> 15:06.800]  Do you have neighbors that are growing hemp or cannabis?
[15:06.800 --> 15:08.640]  You may mess up their entire crop.
[15:08.640 --> 15:11.640]  Also if they're out there growing hemp or cannabis and they miss their males, they're
[15:11.640 --> 15:13.400]  going to mess up your crop too.
[15:13.400 --> 15:14.400]  So be very careful.
[15:14.400 --> 15:16.440]  Learn how to identify males.
[15:16.440 --> 15:20.840]  It is best practice in my opinion to put tested plants outdoors so we don't put boys out there.
[15:20.840 --> 15:24.600]  I understand a lot of people are just plopping thousands of seeds and hoping to find the
[15:24.600 --> 15:25.600]  boys.
[15:25.600 --> 15:26.600]  Be very careful with that.
[15:26.600 --> 15:28.740]  Be very diligent with your male search.
[15:28.740 --> 15:33.140]  Please, please don't ruin other people's crops with your stray pollen.
[15:33.140 --> 15:36.940]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[15:36.940 --> 15:41.220]  growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out
[15:41.220 --> 15:44.100]  there, I want to thank you once again for listening to another episode of the Grow From

[15:58.840 --> 15:59.840]  show.
[15:59.840 --> 16:02.480]  Of course, I did smoke some good shit today that got me talkative, but let me know what

[16:04.460 --> 16:05.720]  Maybe I'll keep doing the shorties.
[16:05.720 --> 16:07.540]  Maybe I'll start making them longer again.
[16:07.540 --> 16:08.540]  Let me know what you think.
