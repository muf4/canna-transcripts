[01:32.870 --> 01:36.630]  hits like a champ. I got the short stack here, it's the little one with the 14
[01:36.630 --> 01:41.550]  millimeter joint on it. I've got a highly educated dualitye nail on there. We've
[01:41.550 --> 01:45.830]  been pulling dabs of Lemon G from Turpex and it has been a wonderful day.

[01:53.790 --> 01:58.670]  features my friend Kabuki J Fox. He has a company known as Fox Trax. He's known for
[01:58.670 --> 02:04.790]  the hashtag RunCBD. We're going to talk a whole lot about CBD. So I think you guys
[02:04.790 --> 02:07.910]  should get out a notebook because you might learn some shit and I'm gonna let
[02:07.910 --> 02:10.710]  the music play for a couple of seconds. Oh you know what, before I get that far, I
[02:10.710 --> 02:13.750]  want to give a huge shout out to my friends at the Canna Canyon. This podcast
[02:13.750 --> 02:17.950]  was recorded live at the Canna Canyon. The Canna Canyon is a private social
[02:17.950 --> 02:21.950]  club. If you've got an ID that says you're 21 and over and you've got a few
[02:21.950 --> 02:26.150]  bucks, you can drop on into the Canna Canyon, sign up, sign a member agreement
[02:26.150 --> 02:29.750]  and you can hang out, take some dabs with us. You can smoke some flowers with us.
[02:29.750 --> 02:33.790]  It's a really chill environment. The place is classy as fuck. I will have
[02:33.790 --> 02:38.430]  Camille, the owner of the business, on the podcast here real soon. In the
[02:38.430 --> 02:43.590]  meantime, check it out you guys. It's at 1507 West Colorado Avenue in beautiful
[02:43.590 --> 02:47.390]  Colorado Springs, Colorado. There's a sign out front that says the Canna Canyon.
[02:47.390 --> 02:51.830]  It will be easy for you to find. Go check it out. Alright, I'm gonna fade out the
[02:51.830 --> 02:55.630]  music for a couple of seconds and I will be right back with our friend Kabuki J. Fox.
[02:55.630 --> 03:03.510]  Alright, welcome back ladies and gentlemen. We are here at the
[03:03.510 --> 03:07.470]  Canna Canyon in Colorado Springs. Let me find the address. We are at 1507 West
[03:07.590 --> 03:12.310]  Colorado Avenue in Colorado Springs. We are at a really cool place you guys. This
[03:12.310 --> 03:16.470]  is a place where adults 21 and over, if you've got an ID and a few bucks at the
[03:16.470 --> 03:20.230]  door, you can come in and you can hang out and you can take dabs. There are
[03:20.230 --> 03:24.510]  people from Colorado here that are kind of heads in the scene. Some of Colorado's
[03:24.510 --> 03:27.870]  finest is here. Colorado Springs' finest is here and actually we've got people
[03:27.870 --> 03:32.230]  here from Texas hanging out, taking dabs, being beautiful. There are ladies here.
[03:32.230 --> 03:37.790]  There are dudes here. There are more ladies than men here. Yeah, that is pretty
[03:37.790 --> 03:40.670]  rare for a cannabis club. So big shout out to the... Hey, take care of yourself.
[03:40.670 --> 03:43.390]  Leaving the club right now is my good buddy Jason Margulies. Have a great day
[03:43.390 --> 03:47.550]  buddy. Be safe on the road. He's out of here. So sitting to my right, I'm gonna
[03:47.550 --> 03:51.030]  introduce the man, the myth, the legend, Mr. Kabuki J. Fox. How you doing brother?
[03:51.030 --> 03:54.390]  I'm pretty good Jeff. How about yourself? Dude, I am great. I'm excited to have you here. I'm
[03:54.390 --> 03:57.830]  excited to be at a club in Springs where we could just take some dabs. I love this
[03:57.830 --> 04:01.190]  place. This place has such a great vibe to it. It's definitely one of the first
[04:01.190 --> 04:04.630]  spots I go to when I come down to the Springs now. Well, I'm actually here now,
[04:04.630 --> 04:08.470]  so you know, one of the first places I go to. We're gonna be doing shows from here a lot, I
[04:08.470 --> 04:12.270]  feel like, because this place has a great vibe. Shout out to Camille for inviting
[04:12.270 --> 04:30.710]  me here. Shout out to the whole staff. She's the sweetheart. Dude, they treat me like a VIP when I show up. I know, it's hard not to feel special when I come here. I haven't turned a doorknob here. Every time I show up, somebody opens a door for me. They carry my goodies in for me. It's a great place. It's the sweetest. Big shout out to the club. So our friend Fox here. I know you mostly as Fox. I'll probably call you Fox through most of the show.
[04:30.710 --> 04:36.550]  That's fine, man. You are who I refer to as my CBD expert. If I've got a CBD question, I usually call you up.
[04:37.270 --> 04:42.630]  So I guess what I should start with is, can you tell my listeners a little bit about what CBD is?
[04:42.630 --> 04:52.310]  Okay. CBD, just like THC, is a compound cannabinoid in cannabis that is non-psychoactive. So let's say
[04:52.310 --> 05:01.510]  THC is a psychoactive compound, which obviously gives us a great feeling. CBD is a non-psychoactive
[05:01.510 --> 05:12.710]  cannabinoid that has different qualities that THC doesn't have. It's one of 138 found in cannabis.
[05:14.070 --> 05:15.590]  138 cannabinoids?
[05:15.590 --> 05:16.230]  138.
[05:16.230 --> 05:18.870]  Oh, wow. I only know of maybe 12 or 13.
[05:18.950 --> 05:23.830]  Oh, yeah. I'm right there with you. PhD was sitting down with me and telling me all this,
[05:23.830 --> 05:25.830]  and I was just like, go on, please.
[05:25.830 --> 05:27.270]  Yeah, tell me more. Let's hear about them all.
[05:27.270 --> 05:28.310]  As the science catches up, we'll get there.
[05:28.310 --> 05:29.670]  Let's get that PhD guy on here one day.
[05:29.670 --> 05:30.230]  Oh, absolutely.
[05:30.230 --> 05:30.790]  Bring him next time.
[05:30.790 --> 05:31.510]  Definitely.
[05:31.510 --> 05:36.070]  So THC is the one that we all love. It gets us high. It gets us blazed. You said there is no
[05:36.070 --> 05:38.390]  psychoactive effects to CBD.
[05:38.390 --> 05:43.430]  No, there's more like a euphoric effect. In high doses, you can get kind of like an
[05:43.430 --> 05:50.470]  elevated euphoria, but it's nothing like a psychoactive effect where you feel high, per se.
[05:50.470 --> 05:54.950]  Right. I've smoked a lot of CBD. Being in Colorado, we're blessed to have CBD available.
[05:55.910 --> 06:00.150]  I don't smoke a lot of CBD myself. It doesn't do anything for me. I am a medical marijuana patient,
[06:00.150 --> 06:02.470]  but I don't need the CBD, so I try to save it for the patients.
[06:02.470 --> 06:03.110]  Gotcha.
[06:03.110 --> 06:04.790]  We did talk about it on one episode.
[06:06.070 --> 06:09.190]  We'll talk a little bit later about the effect that it had on myself and a friend.
[06:09.190 --> 06:10.550]  Oh, I'd love to hear it. Yeah.
[06:10.550 --> 06:15.590]  But I want to hear more about, so why are we going for the CBD? What does it really do for you? Why
[06:15.590 --> 06:19.030]  are you so enthusiastic about CBD if it's not psychoactive?
[06:19.030 --> 06:25.430]  Okay. Well, my story with CBD is a little bit, it's long, but-
[06:25.430 --> 06:26.950]  We've got plenty of time.
[06:26.950 --> 06:34.310]  Okay. So in the long terms of it, when I was young, I'd lost a child to epilepsy. And so-
[06:34.310 --> 06:35.190]  Your own child?
[06:35.190 --> 06:35.430]  Yeah.
[06:35.430 --> 06:36.630]  I'm sorry, brother. I never knew that.
[06:36.630 --> 06:41.590]  No, yeah. It's fine, brother. That's why I'm here and that's why I raise awareness. I lost
[06:41.590 --> 06:48.310]  my second child to epilepsy. I was very young when it happened. I had no idea about epilepsy at the
[06:48.310 --> 06:57.190]  time. Literally, it took me by storm. There was a good seven year period where I had one to a very
[06:58.390 --> 07:05.110]  confused place. It put strain on every relationship around me. All that I continued to focus on at the
[07:05.110 --> 07:11.190]  time was cannabis. And I had no idea that it would bring me round circle to something that I
[07:11.190 --> 07:16.550]  had dealt with and not really knew about what had gone on until I met a parent going through something
[07:16.550 --> 07:21.510]  similar with their nonverbal autistic child who was a cannabis patient in their state.
[07:21.510 --> 07:27.350]  They started telling me all about the wonders of how CBD is working for them, but they have
[07:27.350 --> 07:31.830]  problems getting it, problems obtaining it. The CBD that they were getting was tainted and making
[07:31.830 --> 07:33.830]  their child sick. So that's my question.
[07:33.830 --> 07:36.630]  Coming from another country, had random shit in it.
[07:36.630 --> 07:37.350]  Absolutely.
[07:37.350 --> 07:38.630]  Okay. Terrible.
[07:38.630 --> 07:44.070]  Yeah. So we didn't know much. Let's say, this was two years ago that I contacted other parents.
[07:44.070 --> 07:48.870]  We didn't know what we know now and what is available now definitely wasn't them.
[07:49.590 --> 07:51.350]  Yeah. I've seen you come a long way. I've seen you...
[07:51.350 --> 07:52.070]  Thank you.
[07:52.070 --> 07:54.870]  The hash that you brought today is amazing. How much of that did you make?
[07:54.870 --> 08:00.950]  Oh, absolutely. Only one of these, actually. The rest of them are from companies that I love to
[08:00.950 --> 08:01.350]  support.
[08:01.350 --> 08:03.110]  All right. You can shout them out if you feel like.
[08:04.070 --> 08:10.230]  I've got a little bit of a craft concentrate as well as a Viola Live resin and some wonderful
[08:10.230 --> 08:15.590]  full malt extractions from Natural Mystic Caregivers, some blueberry cherry CBD.
[08:17.030 --> 08:22.230]  I like to mix it up, man. Usually if I run something, it's out of my garden and it's
[08:23.110 --> 08:25.830]  first donated to the patient. So it's very limited on the...
[08:25.830 --> 08:26.790]  Right.
[08:26.790 --> 08:28.870]  Very limited small batch drops that I have.
[08:28.870 --> 08:29.830]  That's the way it should be.
[08:29.910 --> 08:35.350]  So I'd rather just... Luckily, in a great place where a lot of our friends are in the community
[08:35.350 --> 08:38.950]  and the industry and they're killing it at what they do. So I'm happy to support any of them.
[08:39.590 --> 08:43.030]  I like the way you do things. I've been watching you on... We should let people know how they can
[08:43.030 --> 08:46.550]  follow you on social media. How can they find you on Instagram and Facebook while they're listening?
[08:46.550 --> 08:53.750]  On Facebook, I am KabukiJFox. And on Instagram, I am at FoxTracks. F-O-X-T-R-A-C-T-C-S.
[08:53.750 --> 08:56.630]  Go check them out while we're talking, you guys. Go make sure you stalk them a little bit.
[08:57.110 --> 08:59.910]  Oh, excuse me. I'm coughing into the microphone. He gave me a big old fat dab of some solvent
[08:59.910 --> 09:03.030]  just a few minutes ago and I'm still sweating a little bit from it. I appreciate that.
[09:03.030 --> 09:03.750]  No problem, man.
[09:03.750 --> 09:06.470]  That was a good dab. Super flavorful. Off of... We got to give a shout out to
[09:06.470 --> 09:09.510]  Bear Mountain Glass for the gorgeous... What colors exactly are those?
[09:09.510 --> 09:14.150]  Oh, okay. So that is my Bear Mountain Studios custom one-of-one
[09:14.150 --> 09:19.350]  raindrop and purple lollipop, Kleinde. It's a Klein, but it's kind of a Klein. So
[09:19.910 --> 09:22.870]  he calls it a Kleinde. So that's what I've kind of been calling it.
[09:22.870 --> 09:23.590]  It's gorgeous.
[09:23.670 --> 09:25.030]  Thank you so much. I get a lot of compliments on it. It's a beautiful piece.
[09:25.030 --> 09:29.350]  It's sort of got almost an egg sort of a feel to it as well with the way that it's hollow there.
[09:29.350 --> 09:33.510]  Yeah, absolutely. Almost like a hollow honey jar of sorts.
[09:33.510 --> 09:33.750]  Yeah.
[09:33.750 --> 09:35.350]  And the opals really do kick it off.
[09:35.350 --> 09:39.910]  If you guys follow me on Instagram, it's irie__genetics. I will post a picture of that.
[09:39.910 --> 09:43.590]  I took a nice picture of it, you guys. And I'm sure you can find it on Fox's Instagram page.
[09:43.590 --> 09:45.510]  Absolutely. I'll be resharing all those photos.
[09:45.510 --> 09:49.030]  Yeah. We'll take a pic of that and take a pic of us together.
[09:49.990 --> 09:53.190]  Man, that's why you've got the passion. Now I understand what put passion into you.
[09:53.190 --> 09:53.350]  Yeah.
[09:53.350 --> 09:56.950]  That's why you came out of nowhere and you're winning. Also, congrats on the cannabis cup.
[09:56.950 --> 10:03.590]  Thank you so much. It's funny that Jason, who is actually here, it was my material that I grew.
[10:04.150 --> 10:09.750]  He ran it. We ran it together on a wonderful unit that he had, I think a sweet leaf or something.
[10:09.750 --> 10:10.310]  I think so.
[10:10.310 --> 10:14.790]  And then Caleb over there got the oil and he ran it.
[10:14.790 --> 10:21.590]  And then Caleb over there got the oil and cranked it out into the award-winning chocolate bar that
[10:21.590 --> 10:25.430]  it was. So it's kind of funny that you had all those people in the room at the same time.
[10:25.430 --> 10:28.230]  I'm kind of in a room full of rock stars and beautiful ladies right now.
[10:28.230 --> 10:30.470]  This could not have gone any better. Good work, you guys.
[10:30.470 --> 10:33.110]  Yeah, for sure, man. You should definitely give Caleb a little shout out. Shumit Bars,
[10:33.110 --> 10:35.110]  man. He's definitely killing it with the CBD work he's doing.
[10:35.110 --> 10:39.670]  Shout out to the Shumit Bars. There are a few left on the shelf down there at the
[10:39.670 --> 10:42.230]  Canyon Canyon. Come by. They'll tell you how you can get a hold of those.
[10:42.230 --> 10:44.150]  Definitely. And try the peanut butter. It's very yummy.
[10:44.870 --> 10:48.390]  My favorite was the banana. What was that? A banana something you gave me?
[10:49.190 --> 10:54.150]  Yes. Yeah, that was the entry, the banana cream pie.
[10:54.150 --> 11:00.310]  That was so delicious. And I walked around just slow for the rest of the day. It put a
[11:00.310 --> 11:01.910]  little slowness on my day.
[11:01.910 --> 11:11.430]  The oil that we used for it, it came back testing out at 71.3% CBD, 10.95% THC. So a
[11:11.430 --> 11:16.230]  really strong seven to one. So when we cranked out and did the math and he dosed it out, it
[11:16.230 --> 11:23.270]  came out to like 160 milligrams to that bar. And I mean, it was almost the perfect ratio for
[11:24.870 --> 11:26.470]  literally having the calmest day.
[11:26.470 --> 11:27.590]  I was calm.
[11:27.590 --> 11:32.710]  We gave some and donated some to some autistic patients that were having some rage issues,
[11:33.590 --> 11:38.390]  pediatric nonverbal. So obviously, it's hard to gate stuff like that. And the results that we
[11:38.390 --> 11:41.830]  were getting back from the parents were almost immediate saying just from a few chips of this
[11:41.830 --> 11:45.990]  chocolate bar, they were getting calming, soothing effects. And it was really helping with those
[11:46.790 --> 11:48.230]  serious anger conditions.
[11:48.230 --> 11:51.830]  Yeah. There's no way that I could be rageful or angry after eating that thing. I was just
[11:51.830 --> 11:56.230]  completely calm. I was walking around day two of the cannabis cup just in mellow mode. I got a
[11:56.230 --> 11:57.830]  bubble around me. It was beautiful.
[11:57.830 --> 11:59.350]  Yeah. I loved it.
[11:59.350 --> 12:02.710]  All right. So you said that really helped the autistic children with their rage. What other
[12:02.710 --> 12:06.230]  things does CBD help with? Just to educate my listeners a little. I'm trying to get these guys
[12:06.230 --> 12:06.710]  up to speed.
[12:06.870 --> 12:14.390]  CBD is a neuroprotectant, anti-cancer. So let me pause for a second when I say anti-cancer.
[12:14.390 --> 12:20.790]  We all know that THC kills cancer cells. CBD freezes the cancer cell in its tracks so it
[12:20.790 --> 12:26.950]  can't progress or grow any further, but it will not kill it. So anti-cancer is freezing it at
[12:26.950 --> 12:35.030]  bay its best. It basically causes cell death in the mutated cells so that the tumors can't grow
[12:35.030 --> 12:41.990]  anymore, but they remain where they're at. So if you use a conjunction of a high CBD, high THC
[12:41.990 --> 12:48.790]  regimen with cancer, you're bound to basically stop, freeze, and kill those mutated cells and
[12:48.790 --> 12:51.830]  get back to a healthier way of living.
[12:51.830 --> 12:52.870]  Yes. Hopefully.
[12:52.870 --> 12:58.630]  So CBD is a neuroprotectant. So obviously it's very popular with epilepsy and other neurological
[12:58.630 --> 13:07.430]  diseases, Asperger's, autism, children on the spectrum, Crohn's, PTSD, anxiety. It kind of goes
[13:07.430 --> 13:07.750]  on.
[13:07.750 --> 13:10.310]  So almost anything that an adult would be suffering from.
[13:10.310 --> 13:17.670]  Pretty much. I take CBD for my headaches. I don't even take any form of aspirin or any... I mean,
[13:17.670 --> 13:24.150]  I have completely separated all that with different regimens of CBD and THC and just a healthy
[13:24.150 --> 13:29.590]  cannabis regimen. Feeding that endocannabinoid system is very important. And we all as medical
[13:29.590 --> 13:35.670]  patients have our own deficiencies in those systems. CBD is one of those all around protectants. It's
[13:37.190 --> 13:40.070]  the multivitamin of the cannabis world.
[13:40.070 --> 13:44.710]  I like that. You need to make a sticker out of that. The Centrum sticker of cannabinoids.
[13:44.710 --> 13:51.030]  Absolutely. It does so much and in different variations and ratios, it can help so many
[13:51.030 --> 14:01.270]  different things. I mean, Parkinson's, cerebral palsy, nerve damage. It goes on and on. I mean,
[14:01.270 --> 14:11.030]  it literally... In CBD itself, there's other spectrum of cannabinoids, CBN, CBG, CBC,
[14:11.030 --> 14:19.670]  that all have different medical attributes that aren't psychoactive, get you high kind of things.
[14:20.630 --> 14:27.110]  One of these is an anti-inflammatory. One of these is a antibacterial. One of these is a
[14:27.110 --> 14:32.710]  bone regenerate. I make a CBG cream for a couple of patients that have this rare disease called
[14:32.710 --> 14:39.190]  Keenbox disease, which is where a bone in your wrist is basically dying. And I came up with a
[14:39.190 --> 14:46.230]  salve that literally supplies immediate relief for people that have had the surgery and have that pain.
[14:46.230 --> 14:50.390]  And I'm trying to make that more readily available. That's amazing. That's amazing.
[14:50.390 --> 14:54.390]  Now that should definitely sway some of the people. I encourage people that don't know a lot
[14:54.390 --> 14:59.030]  about cannabis to listen to my show. So that should sway them to believe a little bit more in medical
[14:59.030 --> 15:03.110]  marijuana and the uses, the practical uses. And that we're not just in this just to get as high
[15:03.110 --> 15:09.190]  as we possibly can. And I mean, a lot of us are. I love to take fat dabs and get wrecked, but there
[15:09.190 --> 15:15.350]  is definitely medicinal value in this plan. Absolutely. I actively use CBD in a part of my
[15:15.350 --> 15:22.550]  regimen all the time. I don't just advocate it or do what we do with the genetics and the breeding
[15:22.550 --> 15:30.310]  and just everything in general. I need it. I literally, I know I'm happier with it. I'm calmer.
[15:30.310 --> 15:36.790]  I'm a much more productive person. I don't have going through some of the things that I've gone
[15:36.790 --> 15:43.830]  through at a young age. It weighs on you a little bit. And so it gets hard sometimes. Literally,
[15:43.830 --> 15:51.430]  as soon as I started enriching my cannabis diet with CBD, I've noticed a wide spectrum of
[15:52.230 --> 15:58.630]  problems that I was having day to day, really kind of just have more control over. I don't really,
[15:59.830 --> 16:04.070]  I don't let it get to me anymore. And I just find myself being incredibly more productive when I
[16:04.070 --> 16:10.310]  have it in my system, you know, and I can feel the same way about THC. Yeah, exactly. See, and I'm
[16:10.310 --> 16:14.390]  glad that we can sit here and talk about that because like yourself, you know, you're obviously
[16:14.390 --> 16:20.470]  a wonderful advocate for THC. One of my friends, Team Landon, they cured- Oh yeah, shout out to
[16:20.470 --> 16:23.750]  those guys. Yeah, shout out to Sierra and Landon. Love them. Yeah, they'll be coming back soon.
[16:23.750 --> 16:27.430]  Hey Judy. Yeah, they're out. They just did their New Year's in Vegas. Yeah, I'm stalking you guys
[16:27.430 --> 16:30.070]  on Facebook. You're both beautiful. I hope you're having fun. Oh dude, we'll do a visit, man. They're
[16:30.070 --> 16:34.230]  the roomies. We'll tell you. Yeah, we'll just say hey. Nice. Yeah, they're awesome. I love them.
[16:35.030 --> 16:39.990]  But yeah, he cured his leukemia with THC strong cannabis. Though he started with the realm of
[16:39.990 --> 16:45.750]  caring, which is obviously known for Charlotte's Web and the strong CBD pot. But the CBD oil,
[16:45.750 --> 16:50.310]  which he actually wasn't even using for the most part. I mean, they used it as a supplement
[16:50.310 --> 16:55.030]  because they noticed it was stopping what the chemo was doing. But they made it very,
[16:55.030 --> 17:00.870]  they were very adamant that THC is what killed and stopped his leukemia. And you know, shoot,
[17:00.870 --> 17:05.350]  it's been, I think over six months since he's had a clean bill of health. Very nice. Yeah,
[17:05.350 --> 17:11.030]  absolutely. No forced state chemo anymore. State forced chemo, I'm sorry. No more. All the tests
[17:11.030 --> 17:16.950]  have come back completely negative. There's no signs. He still maintains a healthy regimen.
[17:16.950 --> 17:23.590]  Sierra maintains as his caregiver and we oversee all of that. And I've seen what both sides of it
[17:23.590 --> 17:27.110]  does. So at the end of the day, though we advocate for our different compounds, our different
[17:27.110 --> 17:31.910]  cannabinoids, whole plant cannabis is what I think is best all around the board. Oh yeah.
[17:31.910 --> 17:35.830]  The full spectrum. Yeah, absolutely. The synergistic effect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So
[17:35.830 --> 17:38.870]  shout out to team Landon. It's good to hear that he's doing well. Oh yeah. He's doing awesome,
[17:38.870 --> 17:42.870]  man. Hey, play this episode for me guys. I hope, put them up by the iPhone and let
[17:42.870 --> 17:45.510]  them hear this Judy. I want them to hear this. Oh yeah, he'll love this. Shout out little guy.
[17:45.510 --> 17:49.590]  I hope you're doing well. Awesome. If you ever need anything, let me know. I've got your back.
[17:49.590 --> 17:55.430]  Awesome. Yeah. Colorado Springs is so neat. We were talking a minute ago about how the
[17:55.430 --> 17:59.910]  medical community here has United because we don't have recreational. So we don't have the,
[17:59.910 --> 18:04.710]  there's not as greedy of a vibe in cannabis here. No, yeah, absolutely. It's beautiful. Yeah. I
[18:04.710 --> 18:07.670]  really like it. I'm looking up at the counter and there are a bunch of people just hanging out in
[18:07.670 --> 18:10.470]  line, just waiting to get a dab and it's all peaceful and no one's got a problem. We've got
[18:10.470 --> 18:14.550]  people up there whipping up dabs for them. They're pressing up Rosin and everyone's just hanging out.
[18:14.550 --> 18:18.070]  It's so peaceful. It's great. I love it. You guys come on down to the Canyon Canyon, get a dab with
[18:18.070 --> 18:23.270]  us one of these nights. Definitely come by. We'll give you CBD dab. So earlier you told me,
[18:23.270 --> 18:25.910]  we talked a little bit before we hit record, you guys, we hung out and got comfortable,
[18:25.910 --> 18:29.830]  took a bunch of dabs together, but you were telling me that you made extracts before you
[18:29.830 --> 18:36.230]  even grew. Yes. That whole thing started as me just being a process process. I hate saying that.
[18:36.230 --> 18:41.590]  I mean, I just made oil, you know, kind of devalues what you're doing, but I understand the term
[18:41.590 --> 18:48.950]  where we were, whatever the case was. It started one way and it started becoming clear that we
[18:49.910 --> 18:54.790]  you can only control so much of what you make because it's all in your starting material.
[18:54.790 --> 19:00.950]  Absolutely. And I wanted to start controlling the type of medicine that I was making instead of
[19:00.950 --> 19:06.470]  just processing other people's material. I mean, because it's hit or miss, you have some
[19:06.470 --> 19:10.710]  people that put their love and their everything into their material and it shows when you end
[19:10.710 --> 19:15.910]  up pulling it out and sometimes not the case. You got guys that put their flora mite and
[19:15.990 --> 19:20.790]  everything else into the oil. Absolutely. Exactly what you mean. That's the most wonderfully nice
[19:20.790 --> 19:28.310]  way I can put it to start off this new year. But yeah, so, you know, started processing the oil,
[19:29.590 --> 19:34.630]  found out that I kind of really love doing it. It caught back to my roots in chemistry and just
[19:35.510 --> 19:39.750]  little things like that. And seeing what people were doing with distillation, even a few years
[19:39.750 --> 19:44.790]  ago and things like that. Yeah. And seeing how we're coming along. I mean, we're still a budding
[19:45.510 --> 19:53.430]  baby industry in the chemistry world. Oh yeah, I agree with that. Yeah. So it's amazing to see
[19:53.430 --> 19:58.710]  what we're doing now with technology that's been around for a long time. And now we have
[19:58.710 --> 20:02.870]  these wonderful new ways and freedoms to apply these new applications. So it's great to see what
[20:02.870 --> 20:07.430]  these guys are doing. And people are coming out with new extraction techniques, whether it's in
[20:07.430 --> 20:13.270]  the solventless world or whether we're using nonpolar solvents or whatever the case is. And
[20:13.510 --> 20:18.550]  it's exciting to see across the board. What are some of the things you make? I've seen you make
[20:18.550 --> 20:22.790]  a bunch of different types of CBD products. Run us through the list of what you can do.
[20:24.150 --> 20:30.230]  So we've made suppositories for some patients. We've made dog CBD biscuits. We've also made
[20:30.230 --> 20:38.310]  one-to-one treats for the cancer. Some of our old canine friends have fatty tumors or whatnot.
[20:38.310 --> 20:42.470]  Aw, poor dog. Absolutely. So we do what we can and started coming up with some
[20:43.030 --> 20:49.270]  solutions to try to help those patients. Those people, those parts of our family that we love.
[20:49.270 --> 20:58.710]  Absolutely. I have a few myself. So from there, salves, balms, different ratios of capsules for
[20:58.710 --> 21:08.390]  a wide variety of ailments from everyday cannabis regimens for a normal medical patient to an
[21:08.390 --> 21:15.830]  extended hospice patient where what we do at that point is make them as comfortable as we can.
[21:17.670 --> 21:21.670]  These patients are in the excess of taking anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 milligrams of
[21:21.670 --> 21:25.750]  cannabis a day to make them comfortable because that's what you can do.
[21:27.030 --> 21:30.150]  And you're able to produce that reliably for these people?
[21:30.150 --> 21:31.430]  Absolutely. That's commendable. That's amazing.
[21:31.430 --> 21:37.270]  Everything that we do, we make per patient. It's specifically per. So there's nothing
[21:38.070 --> 21:42.710]  minus the salve that I've talked about, the CBG salve, and then any collaborations that we've
[21:42.710 --> 21:47.830]  done with friends like Caleb or anything like that are things that are even close to being
[21:47.830 --> 21:52.070]  mass produced. Everything is small batch. Everything is individually made per patient.
[21:52.070 --> 21:52.870]  Very nice.
[21:52.870 --> 21:59.430]  We've done cannabis saline infusions as well for those children that have to feed through G-tubes.
[22:00.310 --> 22:01.110]  Oh, wow.
[22:01.110 --> 22:01.590]  We've done...
[22:02.710 --> 22:03.910]  You have to think of everything.
[22:03.910 --> 22:07.670]  Yeah. We've done some medicated lubricants as well. We've done...
[22:08.310 --> 22:09.030]  Those work.
[22:09.030 --> 22:17.270]  Yeah, absolutely. Shoot. Obviously, different concentrates, water extracted, butane extracted.
[22:19.990 --> 22:21.830]  What's the white CBD stuff I've seen?
[22:21.830 --> 22:23.030]  Oh, okay. So the Isolute.
[22:25.030 --> 22:29.670]  I, my friend's team, Landon, have a company called Landon's Health Hut, and they
[22:30.390 --> 22:38.550]  work with the lab here in the States that produces this hemp-derived 99.57% CBD Isolate.
[22:38.550 --> 22:39.110]  Wow.
[22:39.110 --> 22:43.030]  And at first she started telling me about it, and I was very skeptical, and I wanted more
[22:43.030 --> 22:46.710]  information. And then when we got in touch with the lab and I found out that they were using
[22:47.350 --> 22:50.950]  American source hemp, and they kind of walked us through the process of
[22:51.670 --> 22:58.870]  distillating and then crystallizing. And basically, I know I just made it sound like
[22:58.870 --> 23:02.870]  it's a simplified process, but it kind of is. It's just a matter of getting the right material.
[23:02.870 --> 23:07.910]  But you said you've got a chem background, so for you it probably is just basics.
[23:07.910 --> 23:12.790]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I skim the pond with the rocks at times,
[23:12.790 --> 23:17.350]  but what catches really catches. And through a lot of trial and error, you will learn.
[23:18.230 --> 23:19.590]  That's what this industry is all about.
[23:19.590 --> 23:25.030]  Absolutely. Trial and error is your friend. And I mean, that's how I do everything. And I really...
[23:25.110 --> 23:31.030]  We try to focus and don't get anything out until it's right. And in the series of things,
[23:31.030 --> 23:34.470]  I can really only think of one little thing that we've ever gone through. And
[23:35.670 --> 23:39.830]  through making edibles for someone, I learned my mistakes in putting flaxseed in there,
[23:39.830 --> 23:45.030]  because some people are very susceptible to that allergy. But other than that, I can't think of...
[23:45.990 --> 23:50.630]  What we make has really helped a lot of people across the board for all the different ailments.
[23:51.030 --> 23:58.950]  We stay away from alcohol extractions as far as RSO, any alcohol-infused tinctures,
[23:58.950 --> 24:03.830]  or anything like that, just because we mostly started with pediatric epileptic patients.
[24:03.830 --> 24:04.070]  They don't need alcohol.
[24:04.070 --> 24:07.590]  Any trace amounts of alcohol could... The medications that they have to take,
[24:07.590 --> 24:14.310]  for the most part, even trace amounts of that could affect and totally just give them a huge
[24:14.310 --> 24:21.190]  variety of complications with their medication. And I've seen it... It's also... It's very hard on
[24:21.190 --> 24:26.390]  their digestive systems. And children that are going through chemo, children that have autism,
[24:26.390 --> 24:30.870]  children that have epilepsy, all have compromised immune systems and compromised
[24:30.870 --> 24:36.230]  digestive systems in their own way. So one of the problems that I've seen with pediatric
[24:36.230 --> 24:42.310]  patients using RSO is that they have problems holding down that medicine. So I started going
[24:42.310 --> 24:51.590]  around and promoting different carrier oils, different ways of taking this non-solvent or
[24:51.590 --> 24:57.510]  solvent extract and decarboxylating and putting it into a healthier carrier oil for these children.
[24:57.510 --> 24:59.030]  What's an example? Maybe coconut oil?
[24:59.030 --> 25:04.470]  Avocado oil, coconut oil. If someone is diabetic and they want to try a healthier route,
[25:04.470 --> 25:09.910]  there's always hemp seed oil, which is the healthiest. I mean, it's protein juice. It's
[25:09.910 --> 25:15.190]  absolutely wonderful for you. So I'll always say hemp seed oil first, if not avocado oil.
[25:16.070 --> 25:20.470]  Grape seed oil is another wonderful example of something you can use other than coconut oil.
[25:20.470 --> 25:24.950]  But a lot of people are very happy with coconut oil if it works and it works for them.
[25:24.950 --> 25:27.750]  Yeah. A lot of people are on the coconut oil kick. It seems to be real popular lately.
[25:27.750 --> 25:31.750]  Definitely. My first questions with that is if they're a Crohn's patient or a diabetic,
[25:31.750 --> 25:35.990]  I ask them right away. And we just... Transparency is everything.
[25:35.990 --> 25:36.710]  True.
[25:37.430 --> 25:41.670]  This knowledge is all open source. So the more you can be open with the patient and explain it
[25:41.670 --> 25:45.430]  to them, the more they leave knowing at the end of the day, the better it is in the long run.
[25:46.230 --> 25:50.310]  Have you thought about going to dispensaries and maybe to medical shops and teaching the
[25:50.310 --> 25:52.150]  bud tenders this sort of stuff? Or do you think they...
[25:53.110 --> 25:56.550]  I absolutely think there's a really important part in people,
[25:57.830 --> 26:03.110]  bud tenders specifically, getting some form of education because a lot of them...
[26:03.670 --> 26:06.870]  I'll be very blunt when I say this. A lot of them look at it as just a job.
[26:07.510 --> 26:12.070]  A lot of them come in looking at it as the retail job. And there's a lot of retail aspects to what
[26:12.070 --> 26:16.310]  it is because it is a PO, a point of sale system. But at the end of the day, you're dealing with
[26:16.310 --> 26:21.830]  medical patients and what you're providing, what you're helping sell is a medical product based on
[26:21.830 --> 26:23.110]  the recommendation of the state.
[26:23.110 --> 26:25.990]  We want to be taken seriously like a medical industry, like we're trying to.
[26:25.990 --> 26:26.230]  Absolutely.
[26:26.230 --> 26:29.350]  We should take the time with the medical patient is required.
[26:30.150 --> 26:33.750]  I don't think anyone ever got too mad at a bud tender for knowing too much
[26:33.750 --> 26:35.510]  proper information about their meds.
[26:35.510 --> 26:39.270]  I've been a bud tender and I've annoyed a few people with my weed nerd skills.
[26:39.270 --> 26:40.630]  So people just don't care.
[26:40.630 --> 26:45.350]  Yeah. But you tend to feel them out and people that are just there for what they want are there
[26:45.350 --> 26:49.590]  for just what they want. But those curious patients that come in and they have genuine,
[26:51.030 --> 26:56.150]  real questions about things that they don't know, it's always wonderful to have somebody there that
[26:56.150 --> 27:00.310]  knows what they're talking about and just make them feel more welcome. And more often than not,
[27:00.310 --> 27:05.190]  you build wonderful business relationships with your patients and they feel comfortable coming
[27:05.190 --> 27:11.030]  back and getting their medicine from people that actually know and care about what they're providing.
[27:11.030 --> 27:14.070]  I'd rather go eat at the restaurant where the guy remembers me and remember,
[27:14.070 --> 27:16.870]  oh, you liked this last time. You know what I mean? You just want to go back where you
[27:16.870 --> 27:20.150]  build a relationship and aren't treated like customer number seven for today.
[27:20.150 --> 27:21.190]  No, absolutely. Absolutely.
[27:21.190 --> 27:25.590]  Yeah. So you said you don't make a Rick Simpson oil type of product.
[27:25.750 --> 27:26.710]  Do you have an alternative?
[27:28.390 --> 27:37.270]  I do. I literally will infuse, I mean, the oils that we make in comparison are either infused with
[27:37.270 --> 27:49.350]  hemp seed oil, the tincture per se, or we crank the ratios out with raw, veganic hemp seed or
[27:49.350 --> 27:54.150]  grapeseed oil or coconut oil, and we'll use that as the carrier. And we've seen, I can get the
[27:54.150 --> 27:58.390]  dosage almost down to as similar to what it would be.
[27:58.390 --> 28:01.030]  And your body's going to love that way more than all the chemicals used anyway.
[28:01.030 --> 28:05.830]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that black tar, that black sludge is super hard for our body to digest.
[28:05.830 --> 28:08.310]  Oh yeah. I've seen people get nauseous and change colors from it.
[28:08.310 --> 28:13.350]  Some people still eat that stuff raw and I don't understand how they can do it. So we're just
[28:13.350 --> 28:18.470]  trying to find better ways of easier ways for this to get into our system in healthier ways. And
[28:18.470 --> 28:23.350]  that's all it is. Rick Simpson was an innovator for what he did, but now knowing what we know
[28:23.350 --> 28:30.470]  about NAFTA and the process, and I mean, we're at a different place now medically, so we know
[28:30.470 --> 28:33.430]  better and we should provide that to our patients.
[28:33.430 --> 28:35.510]  Right. And I like your integrity on that aspect.
[28:35.510 --> 28:38.390]  Absolutely. I have nothing to knock about. I have nothing but respect for the man.
[28:38.390 --> 28:42.950]  We kind of got sidetracked. We were talking about you started making hash before you started
[28:42.950 --> 28:47.190]  growing. So how did you end up, because you weren't satisfied with the material that was
[28:47.190 --> 28:47.990]  around, right?
[28:47.990 --> 28:53.270]  Pretty much. And Cali and the Bay was kind of, people were on that cookies trip a few years ago.
[28:53.350 --> 28:59.750]  It was all about the cookies. And I was like, all right. A lot of the CBD flower that was
[28:59.750 --> 29:04.870]  coming out was looking like grass clippings or it was really bad. I'm not trying to be mean.
[29:04.870 --> 29:09.350]  Plants are hard to grow. The CBD heavy plants are not as easy to grow as some of the more THC
[29:09.350 --> 29:11.190]  or sativa or indica dominant plants.
[29:11.190 --> 29:11.990]  Thank you for recognizing that.
[29:11.990 --> 29:16.630]  Yeah. As a breeder and a grower, I recognize that heavily. I don't like CBD dominant plants.
[29:16.630 --> 29:21.990]  So here's the thing. As a grower that started out just growing CBD dominant plants,
[29:21.990 --> 29:25.430]  the first time I popped some seeds that were THC dominant, I was like,
[29:26.550 --> 29:27.590]  this is really easy.
[29:29.190 --> 29:32.790]  Well, right. You'd have the curve now and you just took off the training wheels and were
[29:32.790 --> 29:33.750]  learning to fly.
[29:33.750 --> 29:38.790]  The curves that I had to deal with for CBD, for growing the CBD were not what I was dealing with
[29:38.790 --> 29:45.190]  at growing some very wonderful THC genetics that I had been gifted. And I was just like,
[29:45.910 --> 29:48.310]  oh my God, this is great. This is a little bit less bad.
[29:48.310 --> 29:51.510]  Those CBD plants will harm on you. They don't grow very well.
[29:51.510 --> 29:59.830]  They have to be happy all the time. Your ratios will be affected severely if there's any sort of
[29:59.830 --> 30:06.470]  stress during the vegetative state whatsoever, because that CBD is already there in the
[30:06.470 --> 30:09.670]  vegetative state before it's been flipped or anything.
[30:09.670 --> 30:15.190]  So glad you said that. People often completely overlook their veg state. I've watched people
[30:15.190 --> 30:20.470]  build $10,000 flower rooms and spend six or 800 bucks just fixing up a shitty old bedroom to make
[30:20.470 --> 30:24.630]  a veg space. And I'm like, come on, do that. Because that's like you said, that's where the
[30:24.630 --> 30:25.190]  plant starts.
[30:25.190 --> 30:29.030]  Starting stage of life. If you're growing from seed, you obviously want to flex your
[30:29.030 --> 30:31.510]  tapper. You want to make your plants as sturdy as possible.
[30:31.510 --> 30:34.070]  Good, strong adolescence before you put them in that adult room.
[30:34.070 --> 30:40.390]  Yeah. I learned that with CBD plants the very hard way. And every time something happened,
[30:40.390 --> 30:43.350]  I would call one of my friends and be like, look, this is what I'm going through, please.
[30:43.350 --> 30:48.790]  You know, and I want to think, I just want to say this now, and if it's okay if I shot them out.
[30:48.790 --> 30:49.670]  Always.
[30:49.670 --> 30:53.350]  Afrochronic Genez, my friend Clancy has been one of the most standup guys that I know.
[30:53.350 --> 30:58.630]  I actually have free CBD seeds in my book bag from him right now that I'm just remembering.
[30:58.630 --> 31:02.310]  So I will gladly donate free CBD seeds to anyone that wants them right now.
[31:02.310 --> 31:03.510]  I hope people in this room heard that.
[31:03.510 --> 31:10.950]  Oh no, legit. Yeah. I'll gladly say it again. But yeah, he's been a wonderful, wonderful friend.
[31:10.950 --> 31:14.470]  And Josh from La Plata Labs.
[31:14.470 --> 31:15.510]  Yeah, good dude.
[31:15.750 --> 31:19.910]  Yeah. Every breeder, every person that I've talked about what I'm trying to do with CBD
[31:19.910 --> 31:24.070]  has been completely open source with me and helpful. And any little thing that I,
[31:24.070 --> 31:30.070]  it's literally fast tracked me so much that it's a blessing. I'm completely grateful for
[31:30.070 --> 31:35.590]  the knowledge that's been dropped on me because it took me from trying to provide for my patients
[31:35.590 --> 31:41.990]  and struggling to knowing things that I just would have never grasped before. Like I said,
[31:42.630 --> 31:45.990]  I'm truly grateful for it. But yeah, I started as an extractor.
[31:47.830 --> 31:51.510]  It just took one of my friends getting screwed over basically for me to say,
[31:51.510 --> 31:53.190]  you know what, dude, I'll grow for you.
[31:53.190 --> 31:54.310]  Yeah, there you go. Step up.
[31:54.310 --> 31:58.150]  Yeah. I became very public about it. And when I first started growing,
[31:58.150 --> 32:01.910]  my problem was people hoard these or they were hoarding these strains.
[32:01.910 --> 32:02.470]  Right.
[32:02.470 --> 32:06.790]  So it was like, well, let's share them. Let's pull cuts and give them out. And
[32:07.590 --> 32:11.590]  you can only help as many people as you can get this cut out to, which is something I'll
[32:11.590 --> 32:18.790]  touch into later. But my main source was, you know, okay, well, let's make this happen.
[32:18.790 --> 32:25.030]  So my time in Cali, people were on this crazy cookies craze. I was going from NorCal to SoCal
[32:25.030 --> 32:30.790]  and really in Southern California, no hits at all. No progress whatsoever. Northern California
[32:30.790 --> 32:35.910]  is where I fell in love with a wonderful plant called sour tsunami. And I met an amazing group
[32:35.990 --> 32:44.070]  of breeders in the Emerald Triangle that changed my life. They were already caregivers for some of
[32:44.070 --> 32:50.710]  the children in the state going through cancer. These men showed me what real compassion was
[32:50.710 --> 32:56.790]  at the very starting point when I was in this industry and blessed me with some genetics and
[32:56.790 --> 33:00.710]  knowledge and pointing me in the right directions of things for what I wanted to do.
[33:00.710 --> 33:03.590]  They have a name to shout out, like a crew name or something?
[33:03.590 --> 33:05.750]  Ringo, you know, he's no longer with us, man.
[33:05.750 --> 33:06.150]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[33:06.150 --> 33:06.390]  But you know...
[33:07.590 --> 33:08.550]  The spirit lives on, obviously.
[33:08.550 --> 33:14.310]  Absolutely. Yeah, man. There's a lot of them, you know. If they hear this, they know who they are.
[33:14.310 --> 33:14.550]  Word.
[33:14.550 --> 33:19.990]  They're the kindhearted people who don't do this for the name. They just do this for the
[33:19.990 --> 33:23.670]  sake of continuing to push cannabis forward, you know, for the sake of the plant.
[33:23.670 --> 33:25.030]  Very nice. But they've got my respect.
[33:25.030 --> 33:25.590]  Absolutely.
[33:26.470 --> 33:30.870]  All right. So these people at NorCal, you find this crew at NorCal and you fall in love with
[33:30.870 --> 33:33.990]  them. You find Sour Tsunami. You start growing that one?
[33:34.630 --> 33:40.230]  Yeah. Started asking questions, started doing runs with the plant specifically.
[33:40.870 --> 33:46.230]  Then people started talking about this plant, this... Because at the time, even in California,
[33:46.230 --> 33:50.550]  there was such a hype about Colorado and Charlotte's Web and what it really was.
[33:50.550 --> 33:54.790]  And all these guys in California had no clue. So when you had these streams popping up like
[33:54.790 --> 33:59.510]  Sour Tsunami and they're like, oh, well, it's just like Sour Tsunami. And you're like, no.
[33:59.510 --> 34:05.830]  And then you had Harlequin popping up in Carburside down by Oakland. And that was one of
[34:05.830 --> 34:09.430]  the stronger three to one, two to ones. They're like, no, it's nothing like Charlotte's Web.
[34:09.430 --> 34:14.710]  And then this ACDC plant started to come around, you know, and people just started comparing them
[34:14.710 --> 34:17.350]  because no one knew as all these new strains are coming out.
[34:17.350 --> 34:20.550]  Is that from Colorado? Is that a Colorado strain, the ACDC?
[34:20.550 --> 34:20.950]  No, it isn't.
[34:20.950 --> 34:22.950]  Okay. All right. Just wanted to know where that came from.
[34:22.950 --> 34:25.350]  It started in Spain, from what I believe.
[34:25.350 --> 34:26.470]  Okay. I believe that.
[34:27.350 --> 34:31.990]  From what I understand, it started in Spain and somehow made its way to California. And then
[34:32.870 --> 34:35.270]  that's just from what I understand, from what I've been told.
[34:36.390 --> 34:43.270]  You know, as far as our Colorado CBD strains, you know, R4, R5, the RU5.
[34:43.270 --> 34:45.190]  The Torobora is well known around here.
[34:45.190 --> 34:49.510]  The Torobora, the Torosu, you know, the work that natural domestic caregivers down here in
[34:49.510 --> 34:50.070]  the Springs have done.
[34:50.070 --> 34:52.710]  The Blueberrysu, the Harlesu, the Blueberryox.
[34:52.710 --> 34:55.430]  The Kanesu. Yeah, all those are absolutely wonderful.
[34:55.590 --> 34:58.790]  Great strain. Shout out to Natural Mystic for, they're one of the only shops that really
[34:58.790 --> 35:00.630]  focuses heavily on CBD.
[35:00.630 --> 35:06.790]  Absolutely. You can find three or four different kinds of top shelf flour that are CBD dominant.
[35:06.790 --> 35:10.230]  It's actually one of my favorite places in the Springs to go to for CBD flour because, you know,
[35:10.230 --> 35:14.150]  I support any place that will put good CBD products on their shelf.
[35:14.150 --> 35:16.310]  And I know the growers there. I know Joey pretty well.
[35:16.310 --> 35:17.750]  Yeah, Joey's a cool dude, man.
[35:17.750 --> 35:19.110]  Shout out, Joey. Hope you're listening, bro.
[35:19.910 --> 35:21.670]  What else was I going to ask you? I got so many questions.
[35:21.670 --> 35:24.630]  You were talking about labs, getting your stuff tested.
[35:24.630 --> 35:25.670]  Do you have a lab that you prefer?
[35:26.550 --> 35:31.350]  Well, there was a friend of ours that has an independent lab and he really does help a lot
[35:31.350 --> 35:35.190]  of people with low cost testing and does his part to help.
[35:35.190 --> 35:40.950]  You know, Colorado law has made it a little hard for caregivers, patients, parents to have their
[35:42.710 --> 35:48.390]  meds tested because obviously most labs are forced to deal with people that have MIPS
[35:48.950 --> 35:50.950]  licenses, whatever the case is.
[35:50.950 --> 35:55.110]  So there are those few independent people who have taken it upon themselves with their own dollar
[35:55.110 --> 35:58.630]  to provide a place where patients can have their meds tested.
[35:58.630 --> 36:01.830]  And there's actually a place like that down here in the Springs.
[36:01.830 --> 36:05.350]  I don't have all the information, so I don't want to shout out the wrong version.
[36:05.350 --> 36:06.150]  Yeah, that's all right.
[36:06.150 --> 36:08.790]  Yeah. Nate knows who he is and he's definitely killing it down here.
[36:08.790 --> 36:13.830]  So once I get more information, I'll gladly pass along your way and we can share it.
[36:13.830 --> 36:15.670]  You know, sounds great. Yeah, we'll get it out to the people.
[36:15.670 --> 36:19.270]  He's the one who did the testing for the Cannabis Cup entry that Caleb and I did.
[36:19.830 --> 36:22.390]  He's done some other testing for the oil that I've done before.
[36:22.390 --> 36:27.030]  And the numbers have always come spot on to the point where if I go somewhere else and I feel
[36:27.030 --> 36:30.470]  like my numbers aren't right, I go to Nate because my numbers are always right.
[36:30.470 --> 36:30.950]  Sweet.
[36:30.950 --> 36:32.950]  So, you know, I can count on that.
[36:32.950 --> 36:33.270]  All right.
[36:33.990 --> 36:35.990]  So the Cannabis Cup is coming up. It's January.
[36:35.990 --> 36:39.350]  You guys were recording in 2016 and it sounds so weird to say that.
[36:40.230 --> 36:42.630]  Are you going to do anything for the Cup this year?
[36:42.630 --> 36:45.030]  So there are some few plans for the Cup.
[36:45.030 --> 36:47.990]  I'm keeping myself open right now.
[36:47.990 --> 36:51.270]  The way that they split up SoCal for the two weekends was a little confusing.
[36:51.270 --> 36:55.750]  So honestly, that is why we kind of backed out of doing anything so quickly.
[36:55.750 --> 36:57.030]  But we had some things going.
[36:57.670 --> 37:00.950]  Obviously, you know, with whatever happens in Denver, we'll have a showing out.
[37:00.950 --> 37:06.390]  And there is something in California that is calling my attention that, you know,
[37:06.390 --> 37:09.830]  a few people reach out, you never know what collabs you might see.
[37:10.390 --> 37:12.950]  Shout out to Queen Bee Extracts, by the way.
[37:12.950 --> 37:16.390]  She was the CBD winner for Chalice, I believe.
[37:16.390 --> 37:16.870]  OK.
[37:16.870 --> 37:19.430]  And she's doing great things out there in California.
[37:19.430 --> 37:21.510]  Make sure you support the Chalice Festival, you guys.
[37:21.510 --> 37:23.510]  Hitman Glass Duggie is a sponsor of the podcast.
[37:24.790 --> 37:29.590]  So I'm like definitely looking forward to seeing what will come to fruition between now and
[37:30.150 --> 37:32.630]  Cup season, as we all know what that refers to.
[37:32.630 --> 37:33.110]  Yeah.
[37:33.110 --> 37:33.830]  Yeah.
[37:33.830 --> 37:35.270]  Five days this year.
[37:35.270 --> 37:38.470]  It's going to be Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
[37:38.470 --> 37:39.510]  I mean, there's one more day.
[37:39.510 --> 37:42.070]  It's either the Friday before or the Wednesday at the end there.
[37:42.070 --> 37:46.550]  Because for Denver, because 420 is on...
[37:46.790 --> 37:47.750]  Wednesday, I think.
[37:47.750 --> 37:48.150]  Yeah.
[37:48.150 --> 37:48.470]  Yeah.
[37:48.470 --> 37:49.030]  Something like that.
[37:49.030 --> 37:50.150]  It's either Tuesday or Wednesday.
[37:50.150 --> 37:51.430]  So they're just stretching it out.
[37:51.430 --> 37:55.830]  Well, I'm incredibly excited for whatever they want to do for Colorado.
[37:55.830 --> 37:56.630]  It'll be great.
[37:56.630 --> 37:57.670]  I'll have a good time.
[37:57.670 --> 38:02.950]  So you know that the MED has their feelings about how cannabis events should be and what
[38:02.950 --> 38:03.750]  they are in Colorado.
[38:03.750 --> 38:10.470]  And they have a huge opposition to a lot of the way that these events are run.
[38:10.470 --> 38:16.470]  What's your two cents, if I can ask personally, on how that goes here for people like us?
[38:16.870 --> 38:21.750]  That obviously have companies and promote within, as well as the people who enjoy these
[38:21.750 --> 38:22.070]  events.
[38:23.990 --> 38:28.070]  What it does for me is I work for a MED regulated dispensary.
[38:28.070 --> 38:32.870]  So I can't take my seed company and set up a booth because I'm affiliated with that dispensary
[38:32.870 --> 38:34.950]  so closely that I'll be fined.
[38:34.950 --> 38:39.430]  My dispensary will be fined if I'm there selling products or giving products out.
[38:39.430 --> 38:39.670]  Yeah.
[38:39.670 --> 38:40.230]  Yeah.
[38:40.230 --> 38:41.110]  Which I understand that.
[38:41.750 --> 38:44.150]  When you get your MED badge, that's part of what you sign.
[38:44.150 --> 38:49.110]  But I feel that dispensaries, this is Colorado, we're allowed to smoke.
[38:49.110 --> 38:50.470]  Everyone there is 21 and over.
[38:51.670 --> 38:53.030]  It's in an enclosed area.
[38:54.230 --> 38:58.950]  We should be able to, the dispensary should be able to go and set up a booth and show
[38:58.950 --> 39:00.870]  our wares just like any other industry.
[39:00.870 --> 39:05.270]  We have beer festivals where, I'm not going to name any beer brands, but whatever brand
[39:05.270 --> 39:08.550]  A, B, and C bring their beer truck, they set up beer, they serve it to people all day.
[39:08.550 --> 39:10.070]  They shut down whole blocks, you know.
[39:10.070 --> 39:10.390]  Yeah.
[39:10.390 --> 39:11.910]  Whole blocks of downtown Denver.
[39:11.910 --> 39:15.510]  We're doing this at a private event area at the, I forget the name of the place, the
[39:15.510 --> 39:17.430]  X, no, it's not Denver Mart.
[39:17.430 --> 39:17.590]  Yeah.
[39:17.590 --> 39:18.870]  It's there, we're renting a place.
[39:18.870 --> 39:20.870]  We're not even doing it on the city blocks.
[39:20.870 --> 39:25.030]  I think that the dispensary should be able to come, set up a booth and bring smoke and
[39:25.030 --> 39:27.190]  smoke you and I out and everybody out.
[39:27.190 --> 39:28.950]  They should say, this is our flagship strain.
[39:28.950 --> 39:29.750]  This is what we grow.
[39:29.750 --> 39:30.870]  Come check us out.
[39:30.870 --> 39:32.310]  I think it should be fully allowed.
[39:32.310 --> 39:32.470]  Yeah.
[39:32.470 --> 39:32.950]  Absolutely.
[39:32.950 --> 39:33.110]  Yeah.
[39:33.110 --> 39:34.230]  It's kind of crap that it's not.
[39:34.230 --> 39:34.470]  Great.
[39:34.470 --> 39:38.550]  I'm glad to get your two cents on that because, you know, being an independent caregiver on
[39:38.550 --> 39:43.670]  the other side of it, I don't necessarily have to answer to them, but at some point,
[39:43.670 --> 39:45.990]  you know, we cross paths and things are mentioned.
[39:45.990 --> 39:51.910]  So it's interesting for people that are running within that model in Colorado and how that
[39:51.910 --> 39:56.470]  affects us for trying to actively promote an event like this, you know, without being
[39:57.030 --> 40:01.030]  threatened with fines or whatever the case may be, you know.
[40:01.030 --> 40:02.390]  Fines and your business closed.
[40:02.390 --> 40:02.550]  Yeah.
[40:02.550 --> 40:03.270]  Which, you know.
[40:03.270 --> 40:03.590]  Absolutely.
[40:03.590 --> 40:08.150]  A big enough fine, Green and Healthy is a small business, just a few of us, and a large
[40:08.310 --> 40:09.110]  fine would end us.
[40:09.670 --> 40:10.470]  That would be the end.
[40:10.470 --> 40:11.910]  So we have to be pretty careful on that.
[40:11.910 --> 40:13.110]  No, we can't even risk it.
[40:13.110 --> 40:14.150]  And I wish you guys all the best.
[40:14.150 --> 40:14.470]  I'm excited.
[40:14.470 --> 40:15.110]  Oh, thank you, bro.
[40:15.110 --> 40:16.070]  I'll be down there.
[40:16.070 --> 40:17.910]  Are you guys open this whole week for the soft rubber?
[40:17.910 --> 40:18.630]  How's that work?
[40:18.630 --> 40:19.830]  We're officially open.
[40:19.830 --> 40:20.870]  Oh, it is open.
[40:20.870 --> 40:21.030]  Yeah.
[40:21.030 --> 40:21.910]  This will come out.
[40:21.910 --> 40:24.070]  We're open today, but this will come out in like two weeks.
[40:24.070 --> 40:24.950]  So we'll be full on.
[40:24.950 --> 40:27.350]  Oh, by the time you guys hear this, I will have checked them out.
[40:27.350 --> 40:27.830]  Yeah, he will.
[40:27.830 --> 40:30.470]  He'll be back to give you guys a review on what he thinks of the Turpex.
[40:30.470 --> 40:31.030]  Yeah, man.
[40:31.030 --> 40:31.350]  Yeah.
[40:31.350 --> 40:32.310]  Come check out the shop.
[40:32.310 --> 40:34.870]  There's a couple of cool rigs there and some stuff you'd want to see.
[40:34.870 --> 40:35.270]  Awesome.
[40:35.270 --> 40:36.790]  I took some notes, but I think I've gone through them.
[40:37.830 --> 40:39.590]  Man, I love how cool Colorado Springs is.
[40:39.590 --> 40:41.270]  We don't have one of these in Pueblo.
[40:41.270 --> 40:42.790]  So this is kind of chill to be able to come.
[40:42.790 --> 40:46.790]  Yeah, there may be one, but it's real low key and I haven't gone there yet.
[40:46.790 --> 40:48.230]  I don't think it's open yet.
[40:48.230 --> 40:50.070]  So as soon as it opens, I'll go check it out.
[40:50.070 --> 40:50.630]  This is chill.
[40:50.630 --> 40:51.110]  I like it.
[40:51.110 --> 40:53.670]  Everyone's just hanging out, having a good conversation, taking dabs.
[40:53.670 --> 40:54.950]  It's cloudy as shit in here.
[40:54.950 --> 40:56.630]  Yeah, it's an incredibly cool vibe.
[40:56.630 --> 40:58.550]  Then just let us come hang out and do a podcast.
[40:58.550 --> 41:00.470]  Maybe I can get Camille's attention to come say hi.
[41:00.470 --> 41:01.430]  Yeah, definitely.
[41:01.430 --> 41:02.150]  She didn't hear me at school.
[41:02.150 --> 41:02.790]  I'm not going to bug her.
[41:03.430 --> 41:04.230]  She's being social.
[41:04.230 --> 41:05.190]  She's a great host here.
[41:05.190 --> 41:05.590]  I love it.
[41:06.390 --> 41:08.710]  Everyone here is super gracious.
[41:08.710 --> 41:09.990]  I love coming here.
[41:09.990 --> 41:11.430]  Yeah, I'll be here a lot more often.
[41:11.430 --> 41:13.110]  All right, bro, we've been going for like 40 minutes.
[41:13.110 --> 41:16.390]  You got anything else that you want to throw out to the world about CBD while you're on a microphone?
[41:17.030 --> 41:18.070]  You will be back on the show.
[41:18.070 --> 41:20.310]  So if you forgot anything, you'll have another opportunity.
[41:20.950 --> 41:21.750]  So I'll say this.
[41:22.950 --> 41:25.270]  I started this company because obviously something happened to me.
[41:27.110 --> 41:28.950]  To somebody that I couldn't help.
[41:29.590 --> 41:32.390]  My goal is to help as many people as I can.
[41:32.390 --> 41:36.790]  Because if you know that feeling of not being able to help someone,
[41:36.790 --> 41:41.350]  but then are put in a position where you can, why not?
[41:42.550 --> 41:46.710]  And so every day I encourage people to learn something new about cannabis.
[41:46.710 --> 41:49.910]  I encourage people to take up a cause that's close to them.
[41:49.910 --> 41:51.110]  It doesn't matter what it is.
[41:51.110 --> 41:51.910]  No matter what it is.
[41:51.910 --> 41:53.830]  For me, it's epilepsy awareness.
[41:53.830 --> 41:56.950]  And I will talk about it until my face turns blue.
[41:57.030 --> 42:00.870]  And you know more about epilepsy than you did before we started talking.
[42:00.870 --> 42:01.990]  I learned a lot today.
[42:01.990 --> 42:02.950]  I'm really glad.
[42:02.950 --> 42:07.190]  So that being said, that's just my main focus with everything that I do.
[42:07.190 --> 42:08.950]  Jeff, thank you so much for having me.
[42:08.950 --> 42:09.830]  Oh, thanks for coming, man.
[42:09.830 --> 42:13.430]  And you know that anything in the iReed Genetics lineup is always available to you.
[42:13.430 --> 42:14.550]  I don't do a lot of CBD.
[42:14.550 --> 42:15.590]  That's just not my thing.
[42:16.310 --> 42:17.990]  I feel like there are a lot of people out there doing it.
[42:17.990 --> 42:19.350]  But if you do need my help, you let me know.
[42:19.350 --> 42:20.230]  Thank you so much, brother.
[42:20.230 --> 42:21.670]  I appreciate that from the bottom of my heart.
[42:21.670 --> 42:22.310]  Thank you.
[42:22.310 --> 42:23.190]  Back at you, man.
[42:23.190 --> 42:24.870]  It sounds like a great way to wrap up the show.
[42:24.870 --> 42:25.350]  Right?
[42:25.350 --> 42:26.950]  One more big shout out to the Cana Canyon.
[42:26.950 --> 42:28.070]  Shout out to everybody here.
[42:28.070 --> 42:30.790]  Shout out to all the people to my left that listen to this ridiculous podcast.
[42:30.790 --> 42:31.350]  Thank you, guys.
[42:31.350 --> 42:31.590]  All right.
[42:31.590 --> 42:32.310]  Hope you enjoyed that.
[42:32.310 --> 42:33.030]  Everyone's been super awesome.
[42:33.830 --> 42:34.870]  They're over there half listening.
[42:35.750 --> 42:36.470]  I'm going to wrap it up.
[42:36.470 --> 42:37.990]  I will be back to close the show, bro.
[42:37.990 --> 42:38.950]  Thanks again for coming.
[42:38.950 --> 42:39.750]  Anytime.
[42:39.750 --> 42:40.870]  We're going to take some dabs now, you guys.
[42:40.870 --> 42:41.830]  I'm going to hit stop recording.
[42:41.830 --> 42:42.310]  Here we go.
[42:43.110 --> 42:43.430]  All right.
[42:43.430 --> 42:44.710]  That was episode number 114.
[42:44.710 --> 42:46.070]  I want to thank you guys for listening.
[42:46.070 --> 42:50.150]  I want to thank Kabuki J Fox once again for coming down and doing a podcast with me.
[42:50.150 --> 42:54.230]  I also need to send a huge thank you to everybody at the Cana Canyon for the hospitality.
[42:54.230 --> 42:55.830]  Thanks for letting me do a show there.
[42:55.830 --> 42:57.590]  Make sure you guys check out the Cana Canyon.
[42:57.590 --> 42:58.790]  I'm pulling up the address right now.
[42:58.790 --> 43:03.270]  It is at 1507 West Colorado Avenue in Colorado Springs.
[43:03.270 --> 43:03.750]  Check them out.
[43:03.750 --> 43:07.350]  If you're 21 and over and you have an ID with you, you do not need to be a medical patient.
[43:07.910 --> 43:09.190]  Drop in, say hi.
[43:09.190 --> 43:12.950]  Let them know that Rasta Jeff from the Grow From Your Heart podcast sent you.
[43:12.950 --> 43:15.510]  Also, make sure you support our sponsor, Hitman Glass.
[43:15.510 --> 43:19.190]  Make sure you check out www.hitmanglass.com.
[43:19.190 --> 43:21.110]  Also follow my buddy Dougie on Instagram.
[43:21.110 --> 43:23.750]  It's at Hitman Glass Dougie.
[43:23.750 --> 43:26.230]  You guys, I'll be back in seven days with another podcast.
[43:26.230 --> 43:28.470]  I'm going to wrap up this show with some fortunate youth.
[43:28.470 --> 43:30.070]  The song is for a friend of mine.
[43:30.070 --> 43:31.910]  I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[43:31.910 --> 43:35.430]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
