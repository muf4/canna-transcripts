[00:14.780 --> 00:17.340]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:17.340 --> 00:19.180]  It's time for episode number 243
[00:19.180 --> 00:21.100]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:21.100 --> 00:25.140]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.140 --> 00:26.220]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:26.220 --> 00:27.420]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.420 --> 00:29.980]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.980 --> 00:31.940]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:31.940 --> 00:34.620]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.620 --> 00:37.380]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.380 --> 00:39.220]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.220 --> 00:41.180]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.180 --> 00:43.300]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.300 --> 00:44.860]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:44.860 --> 00:47.260]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.260 --> 00:51.300]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.020 --> 00:54.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, this podcast is brought to you

[01:12.340 --> 01:16.340]  I highly recommend thedankteam.com.
[01:17.980 --> 01:20.620]  All right, before we get too far, let me make an apology.
[01:20.620 --> 01:22.500]  I put up a Throwback Thursday episode,
[01:22.500 --> 01:24.580]  and for some reason, Stitcher did not grab it,
[01:24.580 --> 01:26.140]  so I had to repost it.
[01:26.140 --> 01:27.420]  I know a lot of you folks look forward
[01:27.420 --> 01:29.300]  to the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[01:29.300 --> 01:30.740]  A lot of people tell me that they get them
[01:30.740 --> 01:32.500]  through their long workday.
[01:32.500 --> 01:34.460]  I apologize that Stitcher failed to grab that.
[01:34.460 --> 01:37.140]  I did repost it as soon as I was notified.
[01:37.140 --> 01:38.580]  Shout out to my friend that let me know
[01:38.580 --> 01:39.540]  that the episode failed.
[01:39.540 --> 01:41.900]  I'm not sure if he wants me to say his name on the podcast.
[01:41.900 --> 01:42.860]  You know what, I've said his name before.
[01:42.860 --> 01:44.940]  Shout out, Kelvin, thank you for helping me out,
[01:44.940 --> 01:46.060]  for letting me know that Stitcher
[01:46.060 --> 01:48.260]  did not pick up the episode.
[01:48.260 --> 01:50.940]  What happens, you guys, I put the episode up to my website,
[01:50.940 --> 01:53.700]  and then Stitcher and iTunes and all the other services
[01:53.700 --> 01:54.700]  grab it and they post it.
[01:54.700 --> 01:57.100]  For some reason, Stitcher has been missing
[01:57.100 --> 01:57.980]  all of my episodes.
[01:57.980 --> 01:59.100]  They don't grab it appropriately.
[01:59.100 --> 02:02.380]  I have to go back and repost it specifically for Stitcher.
[02:02.380 --> 02:03.260]  I'm not sure what's going on.
[02:03.260 --> 02:04.660]  I've emailed them a couple of times.
[02:04.660 --> 02:06.500]  They take forever to respond.
[02:06.500 --> 02:07.540]  By the time they respond,
[02:07.540 --> 02:09.700]  I've already corrected the issue myself.
[02:09.700 --> 02:10.980]  I will keep an eye on it,
[02:10.980 --> 02:13.540]  and I will keep the episodes coming
[02:13.540 --> 02:15.780]  and keep it issue-free on Stitcher for you guys.
[02:15.780 --> 02:17.900]  Thank you for everybody that listens on Stitcher.
[02:17.900 --> 02:20.020]  I do appreciate it.
[02:20.020 --> 02:22.020]  One thing that sucks about Stitcher,
[02:22.020 --> 02:24.740]  there's not a lot of good ways for you to leave comments.
[02:24.740 --> 02:25.860]  You can leave them on the episode,
[02:25.860 --> 02:26.700]  you can leave them on the page,
[02:26.700 --> 02:27.820]  but it's hard for me to find it.
[02:27.820 --> 02:29.780]  I have to go search each episode.
[02:29.780 --> 02:32.980]  Nothing notifies me that I've got a review
[02:32.980 --> 02:35.180]  or a comment there on Stitcher,
[02:35.180 --> 02:36.020]  so it's hard to find them,
[02:36.020 --> 02:37.580]  but I appreciate your comments and reviews.
[02:37.580 --> 02:38.420]  Leave them.
[02:38.420 --> 02:39.240]  I look forward to it.
[02:39.240 --> 02:40.780]  Speaking of comments and reviews,
[02:40.780 --> 02:43.020]  I wanna start the podcast by reading
[02:43.020 --> 02:45.380]  the most recent iTunes reviews.
[02:45.380 --> 02:48.020]  Let me turn down the music and get right to it.
[02:48.020 --> 02:50.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you wanna leave a review,
[02:50.860 --> 02:52.940]  a rating and a review on iTunes,
[02:52.940 --> 02:54.060]  simply go to iTunes.
[02:54.060 --> 02:55.380]  Go to the iTunes store.
[02:55.380 --> 02:57.660]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:57.660 --> 02:59.660]  Halfway down the middle, there's a little icon,
[02:59.660 --> 03:01.380]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:01.380 --> 03:03.340]  It's a red, gold, and green flag with my face on it.
[03:03.340 --> 03:04.780]  Click on that.
[03:04.780 --> 03:06.180]  Then somewhere toward the middle of the page,
[03:06.180 --> 03:08.260]  there's a spot that says Ratings and Reviews.
[03:08.260 --> 03:09.280]  Click on there.
[03:09.280 --> 03:13.180]  So far, so far, you guys, I have gotten 65 ratings,
[03:13.180 --> 03:15.820]  and they are all five-star ratings.
[03:15.820 --> 03:18.920]  It looks like 55 people have left customer reviews.
[03:18.920 --> 03:21.680]  So far, they have all been satisfied listeners.
[03:21.680 --> 03:23.340]  I would appreciate it if you go and leave
[03:23.340 --> 03:24.800]  a rating and a review,
[03:24.800 --> 03:28.780]  and I will read your review on a future episode.
[03:29.780 --> 03:31.700]  All right, let's get into the first review,
[03:31.700 --> 03:34.360]  and it goes a little bit like this.
[03:34.960 --> 03:36.640]  This one says, let's see,
[03:36.640 --> 03:41.640]  this one is from a person that calls himself Spanky12345687,
[03:41.840 --> 03:43.960]  and they left this review on August 31st,
[03:43.960 --> 03:47.600]  and it says, fucking gnarly show, man, stay black.
[03:50.280 --> 03:53.760]  Okay, I'm white as fuck, but I'll stay black.
[03:53.760 --> 03:55.840]  I know what you mean, I gotcha, I'll stay black.
[03:55.840 --> 03:57.800]  I'm in, and fucking gnarly show,
[03:57.800 --> 04:00.920]  I'm glad you appreciate my fucking gnarly show.
[04:00.920 --> 04:02.720]  We would get along, I can tell,
[04:02.720 --> 04:04.500]  just because you left such a cool comment.
[04:04.500 --> 04:06.400]  So thanks for listening, Spanky.
[04:06.400 --> 04:08.600]  I'm glad you appreciate the fucking gnarly show, man,
[04:08.600 --> 04:11.880]  and I will do my best to stay black.
[04:11.880 --> 04:13.840]  Next review was left on September 12th.
[04:13.840 --> 04:16.120]  Wow, I'm reading this just in time, this was yesterday.
[04:16.120 --> 04:19.640]  September 12th, a person by the name of Mangled Remains,
[04:19.640 --> 04:21.680]  hey, thanks for putting your mangled remains together,
[04:21.680 --> 04:23.920]  enough to listen to the podcast and leave a review.
[04:23.920 --> 04:26.520]  The review goes like this.
[04:26.520 --> 04:28.760]  Thank you for doing a more grow-oriented show.
[04:28.760 --> 04:30.920]  Heard your show called Out of the,
[04:30.920 --> 04:33.680]  heard your show called Out of the Dude Grows podcast today
[04:33.680 --> 04:35.360]  and absolutely enjoy it.
[04:35.360 --> 04:37.800]  First episode I listened to was about scrogging
[04:37.800 --> 04:39.520]  and found it very informative.
[04:39.520 --> 04:42.480]  You, sir, have gained yourself another listener.
[04:42.480 --> 04:44.280]  Hey, Mangled Remains, thanks for listening,
[04:44.280 --> 04:46.440]  thanks for subscribing, and super huge thanks
[04:46.440 --> 04:49.800]  for the five-star review and the good rating.
[04:49.800 --> 04:50.960]  I appreciate it.
[04:50.960 --> 04:52.800]  Man, also, while we're at it,
[04:52.800 --> 04:55.240]  big shout out to my friends at the Dude Grows podcast.
[04:55.240 --> 04:57.340]  There's another podcast about growing cannabis
[04:57.340 --> 04:59.160]  called the Dude Grows Show.
[04:59.160 --> 05:01.120]  It's Scotty and the dude, and they hang out
[05:01.120 --> 05:02.840]  and they talk about recharge a whole bunch
[05:02.840 --> 05:04.720]  and they talk about growing cannabis.
[05:04.720 --> 05:05.840]  I'm not able to listen to that show
[05:05.840 --> 05:06.720]  as much as I would like to,
[05:06.720 --> 05:08.640]  but I do catch a few episodes here and there,
[05:08.640 --> 05:10.600]  and it's a great podcast.
[05:10.600 --> 05:11.440]  If you're all caught up on
[05:11.440 --> 05:13.380]  Grow From Your Heart podcast episodes
[05:13.380 --> 05:15.200]  and you're all caught up on the Spliff podcast,
[05:15.200 --> 05:17.520]  I recommend you check out the Dude Grows Show.
[05:17.520 --> 05:19.520]  It's a really good cannabis-related podcast.
[05:19.520 --> 05:21.080]  They are friends of mine.
[05:21.080 --> 05:22.040]  We are buddies.
[05:22.040 --> 05:24.640]  I hang out at the Dude Grows Cup every year with those guys.
[05:24.640 --> 05:26.000]  We will do a little partying together.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.040]  We may do an episode together in the future.
[05:28.040 --> 05:30.180]  Great podcast, I highly recommend it.
[05:30.180 --> 05:31.640]  But let's get back on track here.
[05:31.640 --> 05:33.040]  Hey, Mangled Remains and Spanky,
[05:33.040 --> 05:35.240]  one, two, three, four, five, six, eight, seven,
[05:35.240 --> 05:37.320]  I appreciate your iTunes reviews.
[05:37.320 --> 05:39.580]  I appreciate the five-star ratings.
[05:39.580 --> 05:42.000]  And if anybody else wants to leave a review,
[05:42.000 --> 05:42.960]  I would appreciate it.
[05:42.960 --> 05:44.160]  Big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band
[05:44.160 --> 05:46.320]  for letting me play all of their music on the podcast.
[05:46.320 --> 05:49.280]  They've given me consent-written permission
[05:49.280 --> 05:50.740]  and I appreciate it.
[05:50.740 --> 05:53.040]  All right, those are the two most recent iTunes comments.
[05:53.040 --> 05:54.840]  I appreciate you guys for leaving them.
[05:54.840 --> 05:57.780]  Let's move forward with the podcast.
[05:58.360 --> 06:01.120]  Last week, I teased that I would be reading emails
[06:01.120 --> 06:03.520]  from a couple of listeners from down south.
[06:03.520 --> 06:05.320]  So I've got those emails in front of me.
[06:05.320 --> 06:07.800]  I'm just picking randomly which one goes first.
[06:07.800 --> 06:09.040]  This one's on top.
[06:09.040 --> 06:12.040]  This email, I'm looking to see if they use a name.
[06:12.040 --> 06:13.020]  Nope, they don't use a name.
[06:13.020 --> 06:14.240]  So it goes like this.
[06:14.240 --> 06:15.720]  Hi, my new friend, I live in Georgia.
[06:15.720 --> 06:18.360]  My wife and I are planning to move to a greener state
[06:18.360 --> 06:21.480]  next May or June, most likely Colorado.
[06:21.480 --> 06:23.200]  I have some family in the Springs
[06:23.200 --> 06:24.760]  and I have lived there before.
[06:24.760 --> 06:28.120]  Colorado Springs is about 45 minutes north of me.
[06:28.120 --> 06:30.240]  It is a military town.
[06:30.240 --> 06:31.280]  It's not a bad place.
[06:31.280 --> 06:34.500]  They are one of the few towns or cities
[06:34.500 --> 06:36.460]  with actual smoke clubs.
[06:36.460 --> 06:39.660]  That's where the Cana Canyon is.
[06:39.660 --> 06:41.320]  That's where the Dab Lounge is.
[06:41.320 --> 06:44.120]  It's where a lot of these smoke places are.
[06:44.120 --> 06:46.440]  So Colorado Springs is not a bad place.
[06:46.440 --> 06:47.740]  This person goes on to say,
[06:47.740 --> 06:51.260]  I want to get into the industry, growing eventually.
[06:51.260 --> 06:53.520]  I currently have little to no experience.
[06:53.520 --> 06:56.520]  I have kids, so an illegal grow is not an option.
[06:56.520 --> 07:00.020]  I have inspected and consulted a few local growers
[07:00.020 --> 07:01.320]  with basic problems.
[07:01.320 --> 07:02.520]  What I lack in experience,
[07:02.520 --> 07:05.600]  I make up for in knowledge and research skills.
[07:05.600 --> 07:07.440]  I'm trying to be as proactive as possible
[07:07.440 --> 07:09.120]  without getting any charges.
[07:09.120 --> 07:10.400]  That's very smart of you,
[07:10.400 --> 07:12.200]  especially since you said you've got children in here.
[07:12.200 --> 07:13.680]  So that's a cool way to do it.
[07:13.680 --> 07:15.960]  You're going to other folks' gardens and learning in there,
[07:15.960 --> 07:18.080]  then you can leave and not be part of anything
[07:18.080 --> 07:20.200]  that goes wrong should anything go wrong.
[07:20.200 --> 07:22.040]  Pretty smooth move.
[07:22.040 --> 07:25.480]  Then you go on to say, I read, listen, learn.
[07:25.480 --> 07:27.660]  I have no college, but I feel like all information
[07:27.660 --> 07:29.800]  is locked up in books, not buildings.
[07:29.800 --> 07:32.720]  My question is, what advice would you give
[07:32.720 --> 07:34.820]  an uneducated family man with nothing more
[07:34.820 --> 07:36.480]  than a deep passion for marijuana
[07:36.480 --> 07:38.080]  and a lot of determination
[07:38.080 --> 07:41.220]  that wants to get into the industry?
[07:41.220 --> 07:42.520]  Then you ask a couple more questions,
[07:42.520 --> 07:44.960]  but we're off to a great start.
[07:44.960 --> 07:48.200]  The first thing that you're going to have to think about,
[07:48.200 --> 07:50.400]  can you get your badge?
[07:50.400 --> 07:52.280]  Everybody that works in the state of Colorado
[07:52.280 --> 07:54.520]  marijuana industry, the regulated industry,
[07:54.520 --> 07:58.480]  it's a marijuana enforcement regulated industry.
[07:58.480 --> 08:00.640]  Everybody that works there has to undergo
[08:00.640 --> 08:02.680]  a thorough background check.
[08:02.680 --> 08:05.560]  If you want to, there are three levels of badges.
[08:05.560 --> 08:08.380]  There are support badges, there's a key badge,
[08:08.380 --> 08:09.520]  and there is an owner badge.
[08:09.520 --> 08:11.120]  Each badge costs more money.
[08:11.120 --> 08:12.000]  To get an owner badge,
[08:12.000 --> 08:13.800]  you actually have to be a license holder.
[08:13.800 --> 08:16.360]  You have to own the license of the business.
[08:16.360 --> 08:19.060]  To get a key badge, a key badge is for somebody,
[08:19.060 --> 08:20.060]  I've got a key badge.
[08:20.060 --> 08:22.540]  A key is for somebody who has got keys,
[08:22.540 --> 08:24.340]  somebody who would make decisions.
[08:24.340 --> 08:28.860]  There has to be a key badge person on premises
[08:28.860 --> 08:31.780]  at all times if there are other people in the building.
[08:31.780 --> 08:33.780]  If you've got somebody with a support badge,
[08:33.780 --> 08:36.060]  there has to be a key badge in the building
[08:36.060 --> 08:38.100]  around them at all times.
[08:38.100 --> 08:41.220]  So a key badge is ideal if you're going to move
[08:41.220 --> 08:44.300]  into the industry and plan on having any sort of
[08:45.780 --> 08:48.020]  management position or any sort of authority
[08:48.020 --> 08:51.100]  within the grow, you're going to want to get the key badge.
[08:51.100 --> 08:53.840]  The support badge is how you get your foot in the door.
[08:53.840 --> 08:56.420]  The trimmers are only required to have a support badge.
[08:56.420 --> 08:59.480]  Blood tenders are only required to have a support badge.
[08:59.480 --> 09:02.380]  But you are limited on tasks and duties
[09:02.380 --> 09:03.620]  and jobs you can perform,
[09:03.620 --> 09:07.300]  which means you are limited on income you can receive.
[09:07.300 --> 09:09.740]  Of course, as you move up in the cannabis industry,
[09:09.740 --> 09:12.140]  your pay increases drastically.
[09:12.140 --> 09:16.260]  From a trimmer to a grow tech to the lead cultivator
[09:16.260 --> 09:19.220]  to the consultants to whoever else you've got
[09:19.220 --> 09:20.740]  in the building, there are a lot of people that you guys,
[09:20.740 --> 09:22.420]  there are lawyers, there are consultants, there are
[09:22.420 --> 09:25.420]  packagers, there are advertising people,
[09:25.420 --> 09:27.160]  there are accountants, there's payroll.
[09:27.160 --> 09:28.960]  There are a lot of people in different departments.
[09:28.960 --> 09:31.540]  But as you move up, you certainly do make more money.
[09:31.540 --> 09:33.420]  So the support badge is a good start.
[09:33.420 --> 09:35.600]  The key badge is where you want to be.
[09:35.600 --> 09:38.100]  So the first thing you need to do,
[09:38.100 --> 09:41.280]  Google, how do I get my Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
[09:41.280 --> 09:43.740]  Division support badge or key badge?
[09:43.740 --> 09:44.580]  Google it.
[09:44.580 --> 09:46.700]  It will take you to, I think it's the
[09:46.700 --> 09:49.160]  Marijuana Enforcement Division website.
[09:49.160 --> 09:52.740]  There will be a page in there with about 10 questions.
[09:52.740 --> 09:55.700]  And it says, if you say yes to any of these questions,
[09:55.700 --> 09:57.500]  you are not able to get a badge.
[09:57.500 --> 10:01.260]  I do not remember the technical parts off the top of my head.
[10:01.260 --> 10:04.920]  If you've got drug felonies within like five or 10 years,
[10:04.920 --> 10:06.980]  I think that excludes you.
[10:06.980 --> 10:10.180]  If you've got felonies within the last five years
[10:10.180 --> 10:11.940]  of some sort, that excludes you.
[10:11.940 --> 10:14.340]  There are just certain things that will exclude you.
[10:14.340 --> 10:16.320]  You need to have your student loans.
[10:16.320 --> 10:17.740]  They don't need to be paid off.
[10:17.740 --> 10:20.680]  You need to be showing progress that you're paying them.
[10:20.680 --> 10:22.040]  I pay child support.
[10:22.040 --> 10:24.260]  I had to show that my child support is current
[10:24.260 --> 10:26.500]  and that I'm not fucking up my child support.
[10:26.500 --> 10:28.140]  And once I provided a copy of that,
[10:28.140 --> 10:29.460]  they're like, oh yeah, all your stuff's current.
[10:29.460 --> 10:30.660]  Here you go, here's your badge.
[10:30.660 --> 10:32.860]  I got my badge because my appointment
[10:32.860 --> 10:34.140]  was at 10 in the morning.
[10:34.140 --> 10:36.620]  And I had my badge by five o'clock that day.
[10:36.620 --> 10:37.560]  It was finished.
[10:37.560 --> 10:39.260]  If I wanted to stay in Colorado Springs,
[10:39.260 --> 10:40.100]  I could have picked it up.
[10:40.100 --> 10:41.460]  I had them mail it to me because I didn't want
[10:41.980 --> 10:42.820]  to stick around in Springs.
[10:42.820 --> 10:43.640]  I didn't have anything to do.
[10:43.640 --> 10:45.180]  I drove home and just had them mail it.
[10:45.180 --> 10:46.700]  But I got it.
[10:46.700 --> 10:47.780]  My appointment was at 10.
[10:47.780 --> 10:50.480]  It was done by five and ready for me to pick up.
[10:50.480 --> 10:53.020]  So that's how long it took for me to get my badge.
[10:53.020 --> 10:54.300]  It's not that hard.
[10:54.300 --> 10:56.520]  If you've got stuff on your record,
[10:56.520 --> 10:58.180]  you may have to bring paperwork.
[10:58.180 --> 11:00.080]  You may have to show that all of your court records,
[11:00.080 --> 11:02.920]  that all of your obligations for court have been completed.
[11:02.920 --> 11:05.140]  If you were required to do classes or pay fines
[11:05.140 --> 11:08.580]  or do whatever, you need to show that that's been done.
[11:08.580 --> 11:10.140]  If you've got any sort of court cases,
[11:10.140 --> 11:11.500]  all of it needs to be tied up
[11:11.500 --> 11:13.700]  or shown that you're handling it responsibly.
[11:13.700 --> 11:15.780]  So first thing I would do before,
[11:15.780 --> 11:16.940]  the next line in the email is,
[11:16.940 --> 11:18.920]  what can I do until we move?
[11:18.920 --> 11:21.340]  The first thing, look and see if you were even eligible
[11:21.340 --> 11:22.380]  to get a badge.
[11:22.380 --> 11:24.680]  If you've never been in trouble before, you're just fine.
[11:24.680 --> 11:26.100]  If you don't have any outstanding debts,
[11:26.100 --> 11:27.660]  any student loans, anything like that,
[11:27.660 --> 11:30.320]  child support, bad taxes, you'll be just fine.
[11:30.320 --> 11:33.340]  If you've got some fuck ups in your past,
[11:33.340 --> 11:35.660]  you may need to check out what you need to do
[11:35.660 --> 11:38.300]  to correct that so that you can get the badge.
[11:38.300 --> 11:40.460]  The next thing you can do until you move,
[11:40.460 --> 11:43.180]  it seems to be like you're on the right path.
[11:43.180 --> 11:45.660]  Read, read a lot of books about growing cannabis.
[11:45.660 --> 11:48.980]  Read the most up to date books about growing cannabis.
[11:48.980 --> 11:51.340]  Whenever a new book comes out about growing cannabis,
[11:51.340 --> 11:52.180]  read it.
[11:52.180 --> 11:53.660]  Go back and read all of the old books
[11:53.660 --> 11:55.040]  about growing cannabis.
[11:55.040 --> 11:57.860]  Read all of Jorge Cervantes' Grow Bibles.
[11:57.860 --> 11:59.540]  Read all of the Ed Rosenthal books.
[11:59.540 --> 12:01.860]  Read all of the Greg Green books.
[12:01.860 --> 12:03.320]  There are so many authors in my head
[12:03.320 --> 12:04.380]  that won't come out right now
[12:04.380 --> 12:06.180]  because I'm trying to say them.
[12:06.180 --> 12:07.580]  As soon as I quit thinking about authors,
[12:07.580 --> 12:09.260]  they'll all come to my head.
[12:09.260 --> 12:11.940]  I would for sure recommend DJ Short's new book.
[12:11.940 --> 12:14.500]  DJ Short just recently put out another book.
[12:14.500 --> 12:15.460]  One thing I would recommend,
[12:15.460 --> 12:17.540]  I said Greg Green a moment ago.
[12:17.540 --> 12:19.780]  I would recommend, I'm pretty sure Greg Green
[12:19.780 --> 12:21.540]  wrote the Cannabis Grow Bible.
[12:21.540 --> 12:23.840]  He also wrote the Cannabis Breeders Bible.
[12:23.840 --> 12:26.260]  I would heavily recommend those books.
[12:26.260 --> 12:30.060]  Also, I would recommend podcasts, not just mine.
[12:30.060 --> 12:32.460]  I would recommend a lot of cannabis podcasts.
[12:32.460 --> 12:34.540]  There was a show called Free Weed.
[12:34.540 --> 12:37.360]  Free Weed is part of what inspired this podcast.
[12:38.140 --> 12:39.520]  Free Weed was a pretty good show.
[12:39.520 --> 12:42.080]  There was some great info to come out of that podcast.
[12:42.080 --> 12:44.400]  The thing I didn't like was if you asked a grow question,
[12:44.400 --> 12:46.340]  if you said, hey, I've got spider mites,
[12:46.340 --> 12:48.480]  the host of the show wouldn't teach you about mites.
[12:48.480 --> 12:49.520]  He wouldn't do much about it.
[12:49.520 --> 12:52.440]  He would say, well, go buy this product and spray it.
[12:52.440 --> 12:53.280]  Which, yeah, that's cool,
[12:53.280 --> 12:55.220]  but all that does is make money for that company.
[12:55.220 --> 12:56.880]  And then later on in the show, he would say,
[12:56.880 --> 12:59.200]  also, this podcast is sponsored by the company
[12:59.200 --> 13:01.280]  I told you to buy the product of earlier.
[13:01.280 --> 13:02.940]  And I felt it was a little shifty.
[13:02.940 --> 13:05.040]  Nobody pays me to tell you to use a product.
[13:05.040 --> 13:07.760]  I don't use a product because somebody pays for it.
[13:07.760 --> 13:09.640]  I use a product because it works.
[13:09.640 --> 13:11.740]  And then I like to teach you guys
[13:11.740 --> 13:14.800]  about why you're getting that problem.
[13:14.800 --> 13:15.680]  If you've got spider mites,
[13:15.680 --> 13:17.580]  I try to tell you where they came from, how to fix it,
[13:17.580 --> 13:19.200]  what the problem is, what to look for.
[13:19.200 --> 13:21.120]  I don't just say, go buy some shit and spray it.
[13:21.120 --> 13:24.760]  I kind of try to teach you a long-term prevention.
[13:24.760 --> 13:26.780]  That other podcast was just like, go buy some shit
[13:26.780 --> 13:28.120]  because I'll get a kickback for it.
[13:28.120 --> 13:29.060]  And I didn't think that was cool.
[13:29.060 --> 13:31.360]  But listen to that podcast, Free Weed.
[13:31.360 --> 13:32.920]  There will be some nuggets in there.
[13:32.920 --> 13:36.720]  They have some grow panels from the High Times Cannabis Cups
[13:36.720 --> 13:39.120]  that feature great growers and great breeders.
[13:39.120 --> 13:41.040]  And those shows will be the most informative
[13:41.040 --> 13:43.960]  that will give you the most usable knowledge.
[13:43.960 --> 13:47.080]  Other than Free Weed, I would recommend The Spliff,
[13:47.080 --> 13:50.040]  S-P-L-I-F-F, The Spliff Podcast,
[13:50.040 --> 13:52.480]  hosted by Miss Bo Nellis.
[13:52.480 --> 13:53.780]  She's taking a little break right now,
[13:53.780 --> 13:54.880]  which gives you plenty of time
[13:54.880 --> 13:57.360]  to catch up on all of her episodes.
[13:57.360 --> 13:59.400]  She will teach you a lot of things
[13:59.400 --> 14:02.080]  that you may not even think about wanting to learn.
[14:02.080 --> 14:04.440]  She opens up my eyes to new ideas on cannabis
[14:04.440 --> 14:07.120]  and cannabis usage all of the time.
[14:07.120 --> 14:08.960]  You don't only wanna learn about growing,
[14:08.960 --> 14:10.260]  you wanna learn about the other end,
[14:10.260 --> 14:13.440]  about the use, the medical effects.
[14:13.440 --> 14:14.500]  You wanna learn about terps,
[14:14.500 --> 14:15.640]  learn about all of that stuff.
[14:15.640 --> 14:17.080]  Bo will teach you that.
[14:17.080 --> 14:20.160]  The Dude Grows Podcast is a great podcast.
[14:20.160 --> 14:23.680]  Also, there's a podcast called The Adam Dunn Show.
[14:23.680 --> 14:26.800]  If you are looking for really long podcasts,
[14:26.800 --> 14:29.680]  The Adam Dunn Show can be three hours long
[14:29.680 --> 14:31.280]  without any trouble.
[14:31.280 --> 14:33.320]  I personally haven't listened to The Adam Dunn Show
[14:33.320 --> 14:35.040]  in quite a while because it's such a long show
[14:35.040 --> 14:37.160]  and I've got so many podcasts to listen to.
[14:37.160 --> 14:40.200]  And I notice if I listen to too many weed podcasts,
[14:40.200 --> 14:42.400]  it affects my show and it affects my voice
[14:42.400 --> 14:43.720]  and my podcasting style.
[14:43.720 --> 14:46.600]  And I don't want to rip off anybody's show,
[14:46.600 --> 14:49.060]  so I kinda put up blinders and ignore their shows.
[14:49.060 --> 14:51.240]  I listen to Bo Nellis because we're on a totally different
[14:51.240 --> 14:53.360]  path of podcast ideas.
[14:53.360 --> 14:56.960]  She talks more about the consumption and that part of it,
[14:56.960 --> 14:58.760]  and I talk more about the production.
[14:58.760 --> 15:00.160]  So I don't feel that her show
[15:00.160 --> 15:02.040]  contaminates my mind very much,
[15:02.040 --> 15:05.860]  but I feel like Free Weed and The Dude Grows Show
[15:05.860 --> 15:08.320]  and The Adam Dunn Show can kinda contaminate me.
[15:08.320 --> 15:09.400]  It's like if I were a comedian,
[15:09.400 --> 15:11.800]  I wouldn't listen to a lot of other comedians too often
[15:11.800 --> 15:14.080]  because I wouldn't wanna start sounding like them.
[15:14.080 --> 15:15.240]  Like if I did comedy right now,
[15:15.240 --> 15:16.980]  I would just sound like Joey Diaz
[15:16.980 --> 15:19.000]  and fucking all those people.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.200]  It's like music, you just start saying,
[15:20.200 --> 15:21.360]  I don't wanna do that to my podcast.
[15:21.360 --> 15:22.240]  Anyway, let me get back on track
[15:22.240 --> 15:23.880]  with what the fuck I was saying.
[15:23.880 --> 15:26.720]  The Adam Dunn Show, I think it's hosted by Adam Dunn
[15:26.720 --> 15:28.120]  from TH Seeds, of course.
[15:28.120 --> 15:32.080]  I think the co-host when I last listened was Mitch Shonassa,
[15:32.080 --> 15:35.760]  who has worked with a lot of big names in the industry.
[15:35.760 --> 15:37.700]  He's a very well-respected guy.
[15:37.700 --> 15:39.840]  I respect him, I appreciate his work.
[15:39.840 --> 15:42.600]  Mitch brings a lot to the table for podcasting.
[15:42.600 --> 15:45.560]  He writes great papers, he speaks well,
[15:45.560 --> 15:47.360]  he's got great presentation.
[15:47.360 --> 15:49.040]  He stays on top of the cannabis industry,
[15:49.040 --> 15:52.000]  so he's well-informed of what's going on in the industry
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.840]  and socially and culturally within cannabis.
[15:54.840 --> 15:56.680]  And he's also just a great dude.
[15:56.680 --> 15:58.760]  So it's good to have Mitch on a podcast.
[15:58.760 --> 16:01.720]  And also sometimes Mr. Michael Holley,
[16:01.720 --> 16:03.900]  also known as Bike, is on the podcast.
[16:03.900 --> 16:06.120]  And then they have some amazing guests.
[16:06.120 --> 16:09.500]  Being up there in Denver, right in the heart of Denver,
[16:09.500 --> 16:10.800]  when events come through,
[16:10.800 --> 16:13.020]  everybody goes and stops at the Adam Dunn Show.
[16:13.020 --> 16:14.280]  They've had Chemdog on there,
[16:14.280 --> 16:16.520]  that was one of my favorite episodes.
[16:16.520 --> 16:18.840]  The dudes from Dark Horse have been on there.
[16:18.840 --> 16:20.920]  A lot of, Mila has been on there,
[16:20.920 --> 16:22.520]  if you know anything about Mila Jensen.
[16:22.520 --> 16:24.780]  DJ Nick Atia's been on there.
[16:24.780 --> 16:26.700]  Tim Martin drops in occasionally.
[16:26.700 --> 16:28.920]  So the Adam Dunn Show is a great podcast.
[16:28.920 --> 16:32.260]  I would say listen to all these cannabis podcasts.
[16:32.260 --> 16:36.440]  Also, I would say scour the internet forums for information,
[16:36.440 --> 16:40.340]  but be very careful what you believe.
[16:40.340 --> 16:41.860]  There will be a lot of bullshit on there.
[16:41.860 --> 16:44.400]  Let the forums spark your mind,
[16:44.400 --> 16:47.460]  and then search whatever you read.
[16:47.460 --> 16:50.660]  Do the research and see what you can learn from that.
[16:50.660 --> 16:52.900]  Because I will see shit in a forum and I'll say,
[16:52.980 --> 16:55.500]  this is such a cool idea, and then I'll go, wait,
[16:55.500 --> 16:57.340]  some dude on the internet wrote this.
[16:57.340 --> 16:58.360]  Who knows who wrote this?
[16:58.360 --> 16:59.780]  It could be a nine year old little kid,
[16:59.780 --> 17:03.020]  it could be a 50 year old guy, it could be anybody.
[17:03.020 --> 17:05.060]  It could be all made up, you never know.
[17:05.060 --> 17:06.460]  So every time I read something,
[17:06.460 --> 17:08.820]  I wanna go Google what they're saying
[17:08.820 --> 17:11.060]  from seven other directions and see how this works,
[17:11.060 --> 17:14.020]  why it works, if it works, what could go wrong.
[17:14.020 --> 17:16.740]  Just go scour the forums, get some ideas,
[17:16.740 --> 17:18.380]  and then just start reading on your own
[17:18.380 --> 17:20.380]  and figuring it out from there.
[17:20.380 --> 17:22.980]  Also, what can you do before you move?
[17:22.980 --> 17:24.380]  Keep doing those consultations.
[17:24.380 --> 17:26.500]  If somebody else around you is growing,
[17:26.500 --> 17:27.720]  go check out those grows.
[17:27.720 --> 17:30.160]  Just be around as many grows as you can.
[17:30.160 --> 17:32.980]  Also, be around plants.
[17:32.980 --> 17:34.520]  They don't have to be cannabis plants.
[17:34.520 --> 17:35.620]  If you're working with plants,
[17:35.620 --> 17:37.020]  you're learning about transplanting,
[17:37.020 --> 17:38.620]  you're learning about watering.
[17:38.620 --> 17:41.220]  You can tell how much water a plant will need.
[17:41.220 --> 17:42.340]  Be in a greenhouse.
[17:42.340 --> 17:44.340]  If you can be in a greenhouse or wherever,
[17:44.340 --> 17:48.060]  be around plants, working with plants.
[17:48.060 --> 17:50.920]  Most of what we do in a marijuana grow
[17:50.920 --> 17:54.420]  in a cannabis cultivation facility is basic horticulture,
[17:54.420 --> 17:55.460]  things that would happen
[17:55.460 --> 17:57.920]  in other plant production facilities.
[17:57.920 --> 18:00.460]  If you're producing tomato plants or tulips or whatever,
[18:00.460 --> 18:02.220]  a lot of it is the same shit.
[18:02.220 --> 18:03.580]  Something else you could do,
[18:03.580 --> 18:06.700]  learn about insects and insect control.
[18:06.700 --> 18:08.520]  A lot of people don't know enough
[18:08.520 --> 18:10.540]  about how to take care of insects.
[18:10.540 --> 18:13.500]  One thing you can do, go to the Colorado,
[18:13.500 --> 18:17.420]  just Google allowable pesticides in Colorado marijuana,
[18:17.420 --> 18:19.100]  and it will be the Department of Ag
[18:19.100 --> 18:20.740]  is the website you wanna find.
[18:20.740 --> 18:22.340]  Department of Ag will have a list.
[18:22.340 --> 18:24.020]  The Colorado Department of Agriculture
[18:24.020 --> 18:26.940]  will have a list of products you're allowed to use
[18:26.940 --> 18:30.980]  in marijuana enforcement division regulated grows.
[18:30.980 --> 18:32.220]  Learn those products.
[18:33.220 --> 18:36.180]  Think about which insects are going to infest the crops
[18:36.180 --> 18:37.340]  that you plan on working in.
[18:37.340 --> 18:40.540]  Those are spider mites, thrips, whiteflies, fungus gnats.
[18:40.540 --> 18:42.680]  Powdery mildew is always an issue.
[18:42.680 --> 18:45.140]  Those are basically the things you're gonna run into.
[18:45.140 --> 18:46.440]  Think about all the basic bugs
[18:46.440 --> 18:48.080]  you're gonna get in a grow indoors.
[18:48.080 --> 18:51.320]  Then learn how to combat those pests
[18:51.320 --> 18:53.760]  with the things that are allowed on that list
[18:53.760 --> 18:55.260]  and get good strategies
[18:55.260 --> 18:58.000]  because not enough people have strategies for that.
[18:58.000 --> 18:58.840]  So if you come in and you're like,
[18:58.840 --> 19:00.360]  dude, I know how to take care of these bugs
[19:00.360 --> 19:02.000]  with the products you're allowed to use,
[19:02.000 --> 19:02.960]  it's impressive.
[19:02.960 --> 19:04.840]  People may like that on your resume.
[19:04.840 --> 19:06.960]  So that's something you could learn.
[19:06.960 --> 19:08.680]  Once you move, your next question is
[19:08.680 --> 19:10.500]  what to do once we move.
[19:10.500 --> 19:12.880]  Once you move here, get set up.
[19:12.880 --> 19:15.080]  Before you move, move to an area
[19:15.080 --> 19:17.480]  with an abundance of facilities.
[19:17.480 --> 19:21.240]  If you wanna be a grower, find an area with a lot of grows.
[19:21.240 --> 19:22.440]  Move to that area.
[19:22.440 --> 19:23.720]  Denver has a ton of grows.
[19:23.720 --> 19:24.980]  Pueblo has a ton of grows.
[19:24.980 --> 19:27.080]  Colorado Springs has a ton of grows.
[19:27.080 --> 19:28.840]  Those are all the three major cities.
[19:28.840 --> 19:30.160]  Fort Collins, not so much.
[19:30.160 --> 19:31.460]  Boulder, not so much.
[19:31.460 --> 19:33.280]  They have some but not as many.
[19:33.280 --> 19:35.920]  Those are the three major cities that have a lot of grows.
[19:35.920 --> 19:36.960]  Get to one of those cities.
[19:36.960 --> 19:39.340]  Apply and be aggressive.
[19:39.340 --> 19:42.800]  Have an impressive resume prepared.
[19:43.620 --> 19:44.460]  Look professional on your resume.
[19:44.460 --> 19:45.760]  Yes, it is a weed job.
[19:45.760 --> 19:47.080]  You're trying to be a grower,
[19:47.080 --> 19:49.800]  but still, we need responsible people.
[19:49.800 --> 19:52.620]  We need people with a good resume.
[19:52.620 --> 19:54.800]  Now, one thing I want to say.
[19:55.640 --> 19:57.880]  This may sound like a no-brainer,
[19:57.880 --> 19:59.940]  but I've seen people post things on social media
[19:59.940 --> 20:02.100]  that let me know that I need to correct this.
[20:02.100 --> 20:06.100]  Do not go to a job interview with cannabis.
[20:06.100 --> 20:08.680]  If you show up to a marijuana enforcement division
[20:08.680 --> 20:11.900]  regulated facility with your own personal product,
[20:11.900 --> 20:15.140]  you are breaking marijuana enforcement division rule.
[20:15.140 --> 20:16.780]  You are breaking laws.
[20:16.780 --> 20:18.440]  You are putting that facility at risk.
[20:18.440 --> 20:20.340]  You cannot bring product,
[20:20.340 --> 20:22.780]  your own personal product into a facility
[20:22.780 --> 20:23.860]  that is highly illegal.
[20:23.860 --> 20:25.100]  Do not do that.
[20:25.100 --> 20:28.220]  Also, as the lead cultivator of a facility,
[20:28.220 --> 20:30.900]  if I'm hiring you as a grow tech to be my backup guy,
[20:30.900 --> 20:32.920]  I don't want to see the product you grow.
[20:32.920 --> 20:34.420]  That's not gonna matter too much.
[20:34.420 --> 20:35.660]  I've got that part under control.
[20:35.660 --> 20:38.100]  What I want is somebody that can show up on time,
[20:38.100 --> 20:39.500]  somebody with a solid work ethic,
[20:39.500 --> 20:42.180]  somebody that is willing to learn.
[20:42.180 --> 20:44.680]  One thing, if you know too much about growing
[20:44.680 --> 20:47.420]  and you're trying to work at the facility that I run,
[20:47.420 --> 20:50.260]  chances are I may not hire you because I'm concerned
[20:50.260 --> 20:52.700]  that you're going to come in and try to reinvent my wheel.
[20:52.700 --> 20:55.380]  We've got a very good system at Three Rivers.
[20:55.380 --> 20:57.340]  Myself and a couple other people have devised
[20:57.340 --> 20:59.500]  a really good system from clone to harvest.
[20:59.500 --> 21:01.520]  It works very well.
[21:01.520 --> 21:04.180]  There's a lot of money invested in the rooms
[21:04.180 --> 21:05.980]  and the systems and the procedure.
[21:05.980 --> 21:08.180]  We can't change that because the new guy
[21:08.180 --> 21:10.080]  thinks he knows how to grow weed better than me
[21:10.080 --> 21:11.620]  and all the people that have been there
[21:11.620 --> 21:13.940]  and designed the whole pattern.
[21:13.940 --> 21:16.260]  So we need people that are moldable,
[21:16.260 --> 21:17.620]  people that are willing to learn,
[21:17.620 --> 21:18.940]  people that are willing to listen,
[21:18.940 --> 21:21.080]  people that are willing to take command
[21:21.080 --> 21:23.220]  from somebody who may be younger than them.
[21:23.220 --> 21:25.140]  I see that to be a problem in some facilities.
[21:25.140 --> 21:27.140]  I had a boss who was younger than me
[21:27.140 --> 21:28.920]  and he had a hard time telling me what to do
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.340]  and I'd be like, bro, you're the boss.
[21:30.340 --> 21:31.760]  Tell me what needs to be done.
[21:31.760 --> 21:32.600]  I can do it.
[21:32.600 --> 21:35.180]  Some people don't like taking orders, essentially,
[21:35.180 --> 21:36.780]  from someone younger than them.
[21:37.420 --> 21:39.700]  Just be receptive, be open,
[21:39.700 --> 21:41.540]  and be willing to start as a trimmer.
[21:41.540 --> 21:43.140]  You wanna be a lead grower.
[21:43.980 --> 21:45.860]  90% of the people that start off
[21:45.860 --> 21:47.860]  in the Colorado marijuana industry
[21:47.860 --> 21:50.400]  start off as either a bud tender or a trimmer.
[21:50.400 --> 21:51.360]  That's your way in the door.
[21:51.360 --> 21:52.420]  Show us that you can be there.
[21:52.420 --> 21:54.220]  We've got stacks of applications.
[21:54.220 --> 21:56.780]  On my desk in the office, there's a stack of applications
[21:56.780 --> 21:58.500]  taller than my water bottle.
[21:58.500 --> 22:01.060]  And I just go through them and I throw half of them away.
[22:01.060 --> 22:01.940]  Nope, not qualified.
[22:01.940 --> 22:03.820]  Nope, they wrote something stupid in their application.
[22:03.820 --> 22:04.780]  Nope.
[22:05.660 --> 22:07.060]  Show me that you can be on time.
[22:07.060 --> 22:09.140]  Show us that you can be a hard worker.
[22:09.140 --> 22:10.380]  Show us that you can listen.
[22:10.380 --> 22:11.540]  Show us that you're trainable.
[22:11.540 --> 22:13.060]  Show that you've got initiative
[22:13.060 --> 22:15.100]  and that's how you move up in the industry.
[22:15.100 --> 22:18.500]  So once you get here, apply, be aggressive,
[22:18.500 --> 22:21.660]  have a good resume, and then if you have any special skills,
[22:21.660 --> 22:24.420]  like if you understand pesticides, put that on there.
[22:24.420 --> 22:28.160]  If you can take any sort of basic horticulture classes,
[22:28.160 --> 22:29.900]  put that on your resume.
[22:29.900 --> 22:32.720]  This person asks, is there any online certificate programs
[22:32.720 --> 22:34.580]  that may benefit my cause?
[22:35.340 --> 22:36.180]  Not that I'm aware of.
[22:36.180 --> 22:37.660]  There is a bud tending school here in Colorado.
[22:37.660 --> 22:40.700]  I don't think most employers care too much about it.
[22:40.700 --> 22:44.620]  You'll have to understand a system called metric, M-E-T-R-C.
[22:44.620 --> 22:46.580]  I don't remember what it means.
[22:46.580 --> 22:50.540]  Marijuana, something, something, tracking, something.
[22:50.540 --> 22:51.940]  You'll have to learn that.
[22:51.940 --> 22:53.380]  So be able to use computers.
[22:53.380 --> 22:56.700]  Put on your resume that you understand how to use computers.
[22:56.700 --> 22:59.320]  A lot of that stuff will come into play.
[22:59.320 --> 23:01.300]  We need organized people.
[23:01.300 --> 23:03.400]  You've heard me talk about this on the podcast.
[23:03.400 --> 23:05.820]  If I cut clones, I have to get a sheet
[23:05.820 --> 23:07.660]  that is a clone created sheet.
[23:07.660 --> 23:09.700]  When I cut clones, I write down the,
[23:09.700 --> 23:12.060]  okay, so let's say I cut five Durban poison clones.
[23:12.060 --> 23:14.460]  I write down Durban poison, five clones
[23:14.460 --> 23:17.420]  from mother plant number 5942,
[23:17.420 --> 23:18.780]  and I'm just making up numbers,
[23:18.780 --> 23:20.980]  which shows that I took those clones
[23:20.980 --> 23:25.200]  from plant number 5942, and then I've gotta write that down.
[23:25.200 --> 23:26.820]  Then when those clones go into dirt,
[23:26.820 --> 23:28.420]  I've gotta write down on another sheet,
[23:28.420 --> 23:30.700]  five Durban poison clones into pots
[23:30.720 --> 23:34.240]  from mother plant 5942 on August 13th,
[23:34.240 --> 23:36.200]  and I've gotta write all that shit down.
[23:36.200 --> 23:38.720]  And then, so be organized, be an organized person.
[23:38.720 --> 23:40.680]  Put that in your resume if you're organized.
[23:40.680 --> 23:43.220]  Try to be an organized person.
[23:43.220 --> 23:45.720]  So once you get here, just apply and be aggressive.
[23:45.720 --> 23:48.120]  Don't drop off your application and forget.
[23:48.120 --> 23:49.600]  Drop off your application,
[23:49.600 --> 23:51.560]  ask for the person that does the hiring.
[23:51.560 --> 23:53.600]  Hey, can I speak to a manager?
[23:53.600 --> 23:54.560]  That always helps.
[23:54.560 --> 23:57.040]  The manager walks out and sees your face.
[23:57.040 --> 23:58.840]  Have your badge attached to your shirt
[23:58.840 --> 24:00.240]  so that your name is right there.
[24:00.740 --> 24:02.140]  Now we see your face with your name.
[24:02.140 --> 24:03.980]  Now we've got a resume in our hand.
[24:03.980 --> 24:05.940]  We say, hey, you didn't sign your email,
[24:05.940 --> 24:07.940]  or I would use it right now.
[24:07.940 --> 24:10.820]  We'll just say, hey, my new friend from Georgia
[24:10.820 --> 24:12.020]  that says that on your application,
[24:12.020 --> 24:13.800]  says it on your badge, and I see your face.
[24:13.800 --> 24:15.180]  I've got three things to connect you.
[24:15.180 --> 24:17.380]  Now I know all this information goes to this name,
[24:17.380 --> 24:18.720]  this face, and this body.
[24:18.720 --> 24:19.560]  It helps out.
[24:19.560 --> 24:21.460]  So go in there, ask for the manager.
[24:21.460 --> 24:22.780]  Manager will come out, or they'll tell you
[24:22.780 --> 24:24.100]  the manager doesn't give a shit.
[24:24.100 --> 24:25.820]  Give it to a bud tender.
[24:25.820 --> 24:27.940]  Either way, be polite, drop off your resume
[24:27.940 --> 24:29.100]  and or application.
[24:30.080 --> 24:32.520]  Call, call back and bother them
[24:32.520 --> 24:34.640]  and see if they've seen your application or resume.
[24:34.640 --> 24:37.120]  Or drop in, go in there and check.
[24:37.120 --> 24:38.680]  When you go in, here's advice.
[24:38.680 --> 24:40.440]  When you go in to check on your application,
[24:40.440 --> 24:41.600]  don't shop also.
[24:41.600 --> 24:43.460]  Make it a separate visit.
[24:43.460 --> 24:45.480]  Go in there and buy product,
[24:45.480 --> 24:47.280]  or go in there and check on your application.
[24:47.280 --> 24:49.000]  Don't do both, because then it looks like
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.080]  you just dropped in to buy weed
[24:50.080 --> 24:51.880]  and you thought while you're here you would check.
[24:51.880 --> 24:54.540]  Do those on separate trips.
[24:54.540 --> 24:57.000]  All right, so go in there and be aggressive.
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.960]  Call back, let them know you want the job,
[24:59.780 --> 25:00.700]  because we've got so many applications
[25:00.700 --> 25:02.100]  that you might want to remind us
[25:02.100 --> 25:03.380]  that yours is in the pile.
[25:03.380 --> 25:05.660]  So just call back, bother them, let them know.
[25:05.660 --> 25:09.140]  Just like any other job, be aggressive and get the job.
[25:09.140 --> 25:10.500]  What kind of skillset are employers
[25:10.500 --> 25:11.800]  looking for in new hires?
[25:11.800 --> 25:14.060]  I think I touched on this for a little bit.
[25:14.060 --> 25:16.160]  Someone that can be on time, someone that is honest,
[25:16.160 --> 25:17.380]  someone that can take direction,
[25:17.380 --> 25:19.980]  someone that is willing to grow with the company.
[25:19.980 --> 25:22.500]  The cannabis industry is in its infancy right now
[25:22.500 --> 25:24.220]  and we are growing rapidly.
[25:24.220 --> 25:26.300]  The people that are here right now are pioneers.
[25:26.300 --> 25:29.320]  If you stick around, you'll be something huge
[25:29.320 --> 25:31.720]  in the industry if you are inclined to move up.
[25:31.720 --> 25:34.260]  If you get in now or in the next couple of years,
[25:34.260 --> 25:37.680]  you will be a leader in the future if you are so inclined.
[25:37.680 --> 25:40.640]  So we're looking for hard workers who are dedicated
[25:40.640 --> 25:43.600]  and who want to learn and who want to grow with the company
[25:43.600 --> 25:46.660]  and be part of the team for years to come.
[25:46.660 --> 25:48.540]  And also we need people that are willing to follow rules.
[25:48.540 --> 25:51.480]  You guys, we've got millions of dollars in licensing.
[25:51.480 --> 25:53.280]  We can't fuck around, we can't lose licensing
[25:53.280 --> 25:55.100]  just because people want to play games.
[25:55.120 --> 25:57.460]  That's one of the most important things.
[25:57.460 --> 25:58.560]  All right, I want to thank you for that email.
[25:58.560 --> 25:59.480]  You didn't sign your name.
[25:59.480 --> 26:00.980]  I do have your name at the top of the email,
[26:00.980 --> 26:02.380]  but I'm not sure if you want me to say that.
[26:02.380 --> 26:04.840]  So thank you for the email, I appreciate it.
[26:04.840 --> 26:06.800]  He ends the email with, thank you for all you do.
[26:06.800 --> 26:07.640]  You're very welcome.
[26:07.640 --> 26:09.000]  Thank you for the long email that helped me
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.640]  get a lot of great material.
[26:10.640 --> 26:12.200]  And then they end the message with,
[26:12.200 --> 26:16.400]  P.S. I'm a big fan of the podcast, so go hug your mom.
[26:16.400 --> 26:18.040]  My mom's not around right now.
[26:18.040 --> 26:20.840]  Next time I see her, I'll give her a big hug for you.
[26:20.840 --> 26:22.900]  And you know I'm going to take a fat dab.
[26:22.920 --> 26:25.400]  All right, let's move into the next email.
[26:25.400 --> 26:30.400]  This one is from a person who calls themself Silver Gooch.
[26:30.640 --> 26:32.920]  Not sure if I want to, kind of curious
[26:32.920 --> 26:33.920]  what Silver Gooch means.
[26:33.920 --> 26:36.960]  I kind of don't want to know what Silver Gooch means.
[26:36.960 --> 26:38.000]  Let's read this email.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.440]  It says, hey Rasta Jeff, I found the podcast
[26:40.440 --> 26:41.840]  a few months ago and have been listening
[26:41.840 --> 26:43.400]  to the episodes constantly.
[26:43.400 --> 26:44.700]  Love the show.
[26:44.700 --> 26:46.900]  Your podcast is one of the best I've found so far
[26:46.900 --> 26:49.020]  with a ton of simple to understand knowledge
[26:49.020 --> 26:51.920]  for both hobbyists and professional growers.
[26:51.940 --> 26:53.940]  Keep up the amazing work.
[26:53.940 --> 26:56.460]  Dude, that's exactly what I'm aiming for.
[26:56.460 --> 26:59.000]  I'm trying to give you easy to understand,
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.960]  easy to comprehend information for new growers
[27:01.960 --> 27:03.020]  and professional growers.
[27:03.020 --> 27:04.860]  So I'm glad I'm hitting the nail right on the head there.
[27:04.860 --> 27:06.400]  Thanks for the huge compliment to start off.
[27:06.400 --> 27:08.200]  That's always a good start.
[27:08.200 --> 27:10.620]  He goes on to say, I'm a recent college graduate
[27:10.620 --> 27:11.460]  living in Florida.
[27:11.460 --> 27:13.020]  Well, congratulations.
[27:13.020 --> 27:15.500]  And also, you guys down south, I hope you're okay.
[27:15.500 --> 27:17.060]  I hope you're able to listen to this.
[27:17.060 --> 27:18.960]  Maybe I'm fucking up by putting out this episode right now.
[27:18.960 --> 27:20.580]  Maybe you're not going to get to listen to this.
[27:20.600 --> 27:23.600]  I hope you guys are okay down there in Florida and Georgia.
[27:23.600 --> 27:25.000]  Then he goes on to say with a degree,
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.520]  I was a graduate living in Florida
[27:26.520 --> 27:27.920]  with a degree in accounting
[27:27.920 --> 27:30.400]  and have been a greenhouse manager for a hydroponic farm
[27:30.400 --> 27:32.340]  for nearly three years.
[27:32.340 --> 27:34.720]  I have been meticulously watching any and all attempts
[27:34.720 --> 27:37.140]  at legalizing both medical
[27:37.140 --> 27:39.160]  as well as recreational cannabis in our state.
[27:39.160 --> 27:43.200]  However, I'm not optimistic the way things have been going.
[27:43.200 --> 27:44.880]  Yeah, it doesn't look well for Florida right now,
[27:44.880 --> 27:47.560]  but eventually every state will be legal.
[27:47.560 --> 27:49.320]  That's my hope.
[27:49.340 --> 27:51.180]  He goes on to say, after losing my father
[27:51.180 --> 27:52.980]  a few months ago to cancer,
[27:52.980 --> 27:54.380]  let me stop and honestly say,
[27:54.380 --> 27:55.980]  I'm sorry, that's fucking terrible.
[27:55.980 --> 27:57.060]  Losing anybody sucks.
[27:57.060 --> 27:59.420]  A father has to be the worst.
[27:59.420 --> 28:01.500]  Watching somebody go to cancer must be miserable.
[28:01.500 --> 28:04.100]  So I do send some love to you for that.
[28:04.100 --> 28:06.600]  He goes on to say, it's completely changed my outlook
[28:06.600 --> 28:09.700]  on the way that cannabis is handled today in our society.
[28:09.700 --> 28:11.200]  After everything that has happened,
[28:11.200 --> 28:13.540]  it has only strengthened my resolve to become a breeder
[28:13.540 --> 28:15.760]  in order to help others get the specialized medicine
[28:15.760 --> 28:18.620]  that they so desperately need.
[28:18.880 --> 28:20.720]  It's terrible that it took something like that
[28:20.720 --> 28:22.040]  to make you change your outlook,
[28:22.040 --> 28:24.600]  but I'm glad you're on Team Cannabis now.
[28:24.600 --> 28:26.340]  And I'm proud of you for wanting to be a breeder
[28:26.340 --> 28:28.100]  for such a good reason.
[28:28.100 --> 28:30.720]  There's a lot of people breeding for the wrong reasons
[28:30.720 --> 28:33.160]  and for selfish and personal reasons.
[28:33.160 --> 28:36.160]  And it's good to see more people growing from their heart,
[28:36.160 --> 28:38.360]  breeding with love, even if you're not there yet,
[28:38.360 --> 28:39.760]  you've got the right thing in your heart
[28:39.760 --> 28:41.240]  and that's what we all need.
[28:41.240 --> 28:43.280]  So you're going the right direction.
[28:43.280 --> 28:45.120]  He goes on to say, with that being said,
[28:45.120 --> 28:46.780]  my question is this,
[28:46.800 --> 28:49.120]  how would you recommend getting into the industry
[28:49.120 --> 28:51.460]  in new emerging states or established ones,
[28:51.460 --> 28:56.460]  especially with former agriculture and secondary education?
[28:56.840 --> 28:58.720]  Now, in the last email I read,
[28:58.720 --> 29:00.200]  I talked about getting a badge.
[29:00.200 --> 29:02.680]  If you're not able to get a badge, you can still be,
[29:02.680 --> 29:05.000]  I think you can still be the accountant
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.200]  because you would be an outside contractor.
[29:07.200 --> 29:09.560]  You would not actually work for the dispensary.
[29:09.560 --> 29:12.800]  You would be Silver Gooch personal accounting
[29:12.800 --> 29:15.520]  or Silver Gooch business accounting, whatever you called it.
[29:15.520 --> 29:17.780]  And then you would be hired, you would just be a service.
[29:17.780 --> 29:18.840]  It'd be like going to Walmart.
[29:18.840 --> 29:19.940]  Walmart doesn't need a badge
[29:19.940 --> 29:21.660]  and I can go there and buy supplies.
[29:21.660 --> 29:24.100]  I think, I'm not certain that that's how it works,
[29:24.100 --> 29:25.540]  but that may be the loophole,
[29:25.540 --> 29:27.260]  perhaps if you're not able to get a badge.
[29:27.260 --> 29:28.420]  I don't know anything about you,
[29:28.420 --> 29:29.820]  but I'm just saying since you've got
[29:29.820 --> 29:31.500]  that college experience there,
[29:31.500 --> 29:33.900]  that may be another way in for you.
[29:33.900 --> 29:35.580]  Your question is how do you get in?
[29:35.580 --> 29:38.460]  The same way that I recommended in the other email.
[29:38.460 --> 29:40.680]  Take the steps, see if you can get a badge,
[29:40.680 --> 29:43.740]  then move to an area that's got grows in your area,
[29:43.760 --> 29:46.400]  then apply heavily and then go
[29:46.400 --> 29:49.240]  and make sure those people have seen your application.
[29:49.240 --> 29:50.920]  With all of that greenhouse experience,
[29:50.920 --> 29:52.500]  I'm sure you've applied pesticides.
[29:52.500 --> 29:53.940]  I'm sure you know how to water plants.
[29:53.940 --> 29:55.760]  You probably know how to take clones.
[29:55.760 --> 29:57.740]  Make sure you put that on your resume
[29:57.740 --> 30:00.680]  and list everything you've ever done,
[30:00.680 --> 30:03.920]  especially stuff like if you're a pesticide application
[30:03.920 --> 30:06.440]  certified in your state, write that down.
[30:06.440 --> 30:10.080]  If you've got any certifications, any trainings,
[30:10.080 --> 30:11.560]  even if it's like an OSHA training,
[30:11.560 --> 30:13.960]  everybody in micro is worker protection safety trained,
[30:13.960 --> 30:15.440]  which is a pesticide training
[30:15.440 --> 30:18.140]  that looks really good on a resume.
[30:18.140 --> 30:20.820]  I know how to program a Govita master controller.
[30:20.820 --> 30:23.800]  That is just one sentence that adds to my resume.
[30:23.800 --> 30:26.980]  I am well versed in the Iponics,
[30:26.980 --> 30:28.540]  the Link 4 system controllers.
[30:28.540 --> 30:30.080]  That looks good on a resume.
[30:30.080 --> 30:32.420]  Any of the program or any of the equipment
[30:32.420 --> 30:33.920]  or training programs that you have taken,
[30:33.920 --> 30:35.660]  make sure you include that on your resume
[30:35.660 --> 30:39.000]  and that will help you get into the industry.
[30:39.860 --> 30:41.740]  So he goes on to say, more importantly,
[30:41.740 --> 30:45.020]  is it unreasonable to set my sights on becoming a grower
[30:45.020 --> 30:48.120]  slash head grower slash breeder and living on that pay?
[30:48.120 --> 30:51.220]  Any knowledge or contacts would be greatly appreciated.
[30:52.300 --> 30:56.900]  So yes, you can live decently being a grower.
[30:56.900 --> 31:00.420]  I should not reveal what we pay at Three Rivers.
[31:00.420 --> 31:02.560]  That just doesn't seem appropriate,
[31:02.560 --> 31:05.940]  but the growers do make a livable wage.
[31:05.940 --> 31:08.220]  My friend, one of my coworkers,
[31:08.240 --> 31:09.420]  all of my coworkers are my friends.
[31:09.420 --> 31:11.920]  One of my friends, he's got a decent truck.
[31:11.920 --> 31:12.760]  He lives on his own.
[31:12.760 --> 31:14.620]  He's got his own place and he does all right.
[31:14.620 --> 31:16.600]  He eats well, he smokes heavily,
[31:16.600 --> 31:19.840]  and he lives off of being a Grotec wage,
[31:19.840 --> 31:23.520]  which is the, I think it goes Tremor and then Grotec.
[31:23.520 --> 31:25.600]  And then in our facility, it's Tremor, Grotec,
[31:25.600 --> 31:27.040]  and then there's like a couple
[31:27.040 --> 31:28.440]  of management positions after that.
[31:28.440 --> 31:31.540]  So he's just in the second position and he's doing all right.
[31:32.800 --> 31:35.460]  I am the head grower and I obviously do okay.
[31:35.460 --> 31:36.760]  I've got a decent car.
[31:36.760 --> 31:38.120]  I've got a pretty big house.
[31:38.980 --> 31:40.980]  You can live off of those wages.
[31:40.980 --> 31:44.380]  I don't know how lavish of a lifestyle you've got.
[31:44.380 --> 31:45.980]  You may not be rolling in the Mercedes.
[31:45.980 --> 31:48.060]  You're not hitting the strip club every night.
[31:48.060 --> 31:50.940]  You're not popping bottles, but if you live a modest life,
[31:50.940 --> 31:54.620]  you can live off of a grower, head grower salary
[31:54.620 --> 31:56.720]  very comfortably, very easily.
[31:56.720 --> 31:57.560]  A breeder.
[31:58.660 --> 32:02.860]  Unless you are an established breeder with a reputation,
[32:02.860 --> 32:05.020]  there's not a lot of need for a breeder
[32:05.020 --> 32:06.180]  in a commercial facility.
[32:06.180 --> 32:08.160]  Nobody is making seeds right now
[32:08.160 --> 32:10.820]  other than a couple of specialized facilities.
[32:10.820 --> 32:13.640]  And it's basically the owner is the breeder
[32:13.640 --> 32:14.480]  and that happens.
[32:14.480 --> 32:16.600]  I'm a well-known breeder in Colorado.
[32:16.600 --> 32:19.680]  I've got, I read genetics as my breeding company,
[32:19.680 --> 32:20.520]  my seed company.
[32:20.520 --> 32:23.160]  It's available at thedankteam.com if you're interested.
[32:24.060 --> 32:28.300]  And I don't make any seeds in a commercial facility.
[32:28.300 --> 32:29.960]  That just doesn't make sense right now.
[32:29.960 --> 32:32.000]  Eventually, there are talks at Three Rivers
[32:32.000 --> 32:33.880]  and I will build a breeding facility together
[32:33.880 --> 32:35.120]  and I will breed seeds in there
[32:35.140 --> 32:38.140]  and those will be available exclusively at Three Rivers.
[32:38.140 --> 32:39.900]  But like I said, that's just in talks.
[32:39.900 --> 32:43.580]  So don't look to make too much money being a breeder.
[32:44.860 --> 32:48.020]  Being a breeder would be something that you would do more
[32:48.020 --> 32:50.260]  in your personal grow, in your private time,
[32:50.260 --> 32:52.260]  and then you would grow those seeds out
[32:52.260 --> 32:53.720]  and then you would wanna get those.
[32:53.720 --> 32:55.460]  If you wanna make any money being a breeder,
[32:55.460 --> 32:57.640]  you've gotta get those seeds out, get them known.
[32:57.640 --> 32:59.380]  It takes a long time to get established.
[32:59.380 --> 33:02.780]  And then honestly right now, everybody is a breeder
[33:02.800 --> 33:06.160]  and people either wanna buy from Rare Dankness,
[33:06.160 --> 33:09.000]  DNA Genetics, all those guys that are winning,
[33:09.000 --> 33:13.840]  Swamp Boys, stuff like that, or they want free seeds.
[33:13.840 --> 33:15.240]  So it's hard to be a breeder
[33:15.240 --> 33:16.840]  and make any money off of it right now.
[33:16.840 --> 33:19.200]  I do okay with the iReed Genetics line,
[33:19.200 --> 33:20.360]  but I'm not rolling in money
[33:20.360 --> 33:22.600]  for my breeding projects at all.
[33:22.600 --> 33:24.540]  Your best bet is to start as a trimmer,
[33:24.540 --> 33:27.460]  work your way up as a grow assistant, become a grow tech,
[33:27.460 --> 33:30.100]  then prove yourself as a lead grower,
[33:30.100 --> 33:32.060]  which sounds like you've got the potential.
[33:32.080 --> 33:34.600]  If you've got three years in a greenhouse,
[33:34.600 --> 33:37.420]  you've got a lot more experience than a lot of people.
[33:37.420 --> 33:40.520]  So make sure you can get a badge, get out to Colorado,
[33:40.520 --> 33:43.600]  apply at as many places as humanly possible.
[33:43.600 --> 33:45.480]  Do whatever you have to do to apply at places,
[33:45.480 --> 33:47.500]  get interviews, you get interviews
[33:47.500 --> 33:48.720]  just like you do with any other job.
[33:48.720 --> 33:50.440]  You bug the management, you go there,
[33:50.440 --> 33:52.800]  you do what you need to do, you call, you call, you call.
[33:52.800 --> 33:54.040]  I recommend you don't shop
[33:54.040 --> 33:55.880]  and check on your application at the same time.
[33:55.880 --> 33:58.360]  Once you do get an interview, dress sharp.
[33:58.360 --> 34:01.760]  Yeah, it's the weed industry, but we need clean people.
[34:02.460 --> 34:03.300]  We've got a clean facility.
[34:03.300 --> 34:05.020]  Yeah, I do have dreadlocks, but I keep them clean.
[34:05.020 --> 34:06.120]  I wear clean clothes to work.
[34:06.120 --> 34:07.340]  We don't look like a bunch of bums.
[34:07.340 --> 34:09.820]  I didn't go to my interview looking like a bum.
[34:09.820 --> 34:12.900]  Look decent, don't look like a NorCal Humboldt trimmer,
[34:12.900 --> 34:14.220]  look like a presentable person.
[34:14.220 --> 34:17.080]  This is a real business with a million dollar license.
[34:17.080 --> 34:18.740]  Show up, dress for success,
[34:18.740 --> 34:21.180]  be there to win with the rest of us and we'll hire you.
[34:21.180 --> 34:23.380]  So come to the interview looking like a champ.
[34:23.380 --> 34:25.700]  Be prepared, be ready to learn.
[34:25.700 --> 34:27.580]  Don't act like you're the best grower on the planet
[34:27.580 --> 34:29.100]  because everybody says they're the best grower
[34:29.100 --> 34:29.940]  on the planet.
[34:29.940 --> 34:31.040]  We're gonna hire you to trim.
[34:31.060 --> 34:33.380]  If we hire you, you're gonna start off as a trimmer.
[34:33.380 --> 34:34.300]  Don't lie.
[34:34.300 --> 34:37.620]  Say, I can trim real slow or I can trim real fast.
[34:37.620 --> 34:39.260]  Maybe now's the time for you to start trimming
[34:39.260 --> 34:40.140]  other people's crops.
[34:40.140 --> 34:42.940]  If you've got friends that need help, go trim that weed.
[34:42.940 --> 34:44.420]  Even if they're not gonna pay you,
[34:44.420 --> 34:46.000]  it may pay off in the end.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.220]  If I've got two applicants that are both applying
[34:48.220 --> 34:50.140]  to be trimmers and you've trimmed five plants
[34:50.140 --> 34:51.380]  and the other person has trimmed zero,
[34:51.380 --> 34:52.700]  you've already got an advantage
[34:52.700 --> 34:54.780]  because I don't have to teach you from ground zero.
[34:54.780 --> 34:56.420]  I can say, let's see how you do this
[34:56.420 --> 34:58.100]  and we'll adjust your trim to our trim
[34:58.100 --> 34:59.240]  and then we'll get you up to speed.
[34:59.260 --> 35:01.620]  We expect for trimmers, once they're there
[35:01.620 --> 35:03.640]  for three, four, maybe five weeks,
[35:03.640 --> 35:06.380]  we need at least a pound a day per trimmer out of you.
[35:06.380 --> 35:08.640]  I've got a guy that can do two and a half pounds.
[35:08.640 --> 35:10.780]  There's a guy at another facility we're associated with
[35:10.780 --> 35:12.500]  that does nearly four pounds a day.
[35:12.500 --> 35:13.860]  It's not the tightest trim in the world
[35:13.860 --> 35:18.420]  but he does a trim of nearly four pounds a day, you guys.
[35:18.420 --> 35:20.300]  And that's, the plants are dry.
[35:20.300 --> 35:21.740]  They've been hanging up, they've been de-leafed,
[35:21.740 --> 35:23.260]  they're dry, then we're trimming them
[35:23.260 --> 35:24.420]  and that's what counts is that day
[35:24.420 --> 35:26.660]  when you open up that bucket with the whole plant,
[35:26.660 --> 35:28.260]  then you start going.
[35:28.280 --> 35:30.200]  These guys are pulling one, two,
[35:30.200 --> 35:32.880]  and four pounds per person per day.
[35:32.880 --> 35:36.200]  So start trimming, don't lie on your application.
[35:36.200 --> 35:38.120]  If you can drive a forklift, a scissor lift,
[35:38.120 --> 35:39.440]  any type of stuff like that.
[35:39.440 --> 35:41.680]  If you've got any electrical or HVAC training,
[35:41.680 --> 35:43.240]  all of that type of stuff is helpful.
[35:43.240 --> 35:45.400]  Also, list all of that on your resume,
[35:45.400 --> 35:47.240]  all of that on your application.
[35:47.240 --> 35:49.000]  All of that stuff will help you out.
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.660]  Any computer skills, any sort of technical
[35:51.660 --> 35:54.440]  or mechanical training you've got, plumbing,
[35:54.440 --> 35:55.280]  all of that stuff.
[35:55.280 --> 35:57.280]  We use a lot of plumbing.
[35:57.620 --> 35:59.140]  We have a plumber that's there frequently.
[35:59.140 --> 36:00.660]  We've got an electrician there frequently.
[36:00.660 --> 36:02.220]  Our HVAC guy is there frequently.
[36:02.220 --> 36:04.940]  If you've got any of those skills, that's useful.
[36:04.940 --> 36:06.780]  If you've ever used a CO2 machine
[36:06.780 --> 36:10.580]  and know how to run CO2 and set CO2 alarms, list that.
[36:10.580 --> 36:14.060]  If you've got rescue skills, list that.
[36:14.060 --> 36:16.060]  If you know how to wear a respirator,
[36:16.060 --> 36:17.900]  if you've got a respirator fit test
[36:17.900 --> 36:20.140]  and a respirator training from OSHA,
[36:20.140 --> 36:23.200]  and if you've passed the physical to wear a respirator,
[36:23.200 --> 36:25.020]  list all that because that saves us money.
[36:25.040 --> 36:26.720]  We don't have to pay 150 bucks
[36:26.720 --> 36:28.720]  to get you respirator certified.
[36:28.720 --> 36:29.960]  If you, yeah, stuff like that.
[36:29.960 --> 36:31.960]  List all of that sort of stuff on your application.
[36:31.960 --> 36:34.960]  Anything you can think of that makes you more sellable
[36:34.960 --> 36:38.200]  to an employee still works in the cannabis industry.
[36:38.200 --> 36:40.360]  So list all of that stuff.
[36:40.360 --> 36:42.120]  All right, I think I covered most of the basics
[36:42.120 --> 36:43.920]  on how to get a job in the cannabis industry.
[36:43.920 --> 36:45.680]  It's just like any other job, you guys.
[36:45.680 --> 36:48.800]  You need to get your marijuana enforcement division badge.
[36:48.800 --> 36:49.760]  That's your first step.
[36:49.760 --> 36:52.440]  Make sure you can do that before you even start thinking
[36:52.440 --> 36:53.600]  about coming to Colorado.
[36:53.600 --> 36:55.420]  Make sure you can get your badge.
[36:55.420 --> 36:57.100]  If you come here and you can't get your badge,
[36:57.100 --> 36:58.820]  you're fucked, you can't work in the industry,
[36:58.820 --> 36:59.900]  then you gotta figure out what to do.
[36:59.900 --> 37:01.400]  Your family's here, you're here,
[37:01.400 --> 37:02.820]  and you ain't got shit going on.
[37:02.820 --> 37:04.340]  There's a lot of people that did that,
[37:04.340 --> 37:07.140]  and it makes us kind of look bad to tell you the truth.
[37:07.140 --> 37:08.600]  Make sure you can get your badge,
[37:08.600 --> 37:11.100]  then apply your ass off, and then go get a job.
[37:11.100 --> 37:13.580]  You're gonna have to start as a trimmer or a bud tender.
[37:13.580 --> 37:15.620]  Don't be afraid to start at the bottom and work your way up.
[37:15.620 --> 37:17.360]  People move up quickly.
[37:17.360 --> 37:20.840]  People jump from facility to facility in this industry a lot.
[37:20.840 --> 37:23.100]  There's a lot of weirdness, and it's a new industry,
[37:23.600 --> 37:25.720]  and people are stoners, and people don't take it seriously,
[37:25.720 --> 37:27.120]  so people get jobs, and they're like,
[37:27.120 --> 37:29.080]  cool, I'm the new grower, and then they fuck it off
[37:29.080 --> 37:30.760]  because they don't take it seriously.
[37:30.760 --> 37:33.920]  We fire them, and then we move up a trimmer to a grow tech.
[37:35.120 --> 37:38.120]  I got my job, honestly, because the manager
[37:38.120 --> 37:40.680]  that was in my facility was removed
[37:40.680 --> 37:43.120]  from the management position, and I was the next in line
[37:43.120 --> 37:45.960]  that was most experienced and had leadership skills.
[37:45.960 --> 37:48.480]  I showed leadership skills from day one,
[37:48.480 --> 37:51.000]  and when our gold manager left, they're like,
[37:51.700 --> 37:52.860]  people turned to me, and they said,
[37:52.860 --> 37:54.740]  hey, boss man, what do we do when the manager
[37:54.740 --> 37:56.420]  didn't show up for work the next day?
[37:56.420 --> 37:57.540]  Everybody turned to me.
[37:58.740 --> 38:00.780]  Start off at the bottom just like I did,
[38:00.780 --> 38:03.460]  and you can move to the top just like I did, you guys.
[38:03.460 --> 38:05.340]  All right, let's wrap up this email.
[38:05.340 --> 38:06.500]  There's one more short paragraph.
[38:06.500 --> 38:08.900]  It says, again, thank you for taking the time to read this.
[38:08.900 --> 38:11.940]  Your podcast has taught me a lot about not only cannabis
[38:11.940 --> 38:14.340]  as a plant, but also how much we can help each other
[38:14.340 --> 38:17.660]  with just a little bit of kindness.
[38:17.660 --> 38:19.540]  Man, what a great email.
[38:19.600 --> 38:21.720]  I'm sorry that you had to lose your pops to cancer.
[38:21.720 --> 38:24.080]  That's gotta be miserable, but I'm glad
[38:24.080 --> 38:26.000]  you're on Team Cannabis, and I'm glad you're doing
[38:26.000 --> 38:27.840]  what you can to help other people,
[38:27.840 --> 38:30.280]  and when you guys come to Colorado, both of you,
[38:30.280 --> 38:32.240]  I hope I get another email saying that you're around
[38:32.240 --> 38:34.040]  so that we can take some dabs together,
[38:34.040 --> 38:35.320]  or we can smoke flowers.
[38:35.320 --> 38:37.240]  I know you guys may not have dabs as much
[38:37.240 --> 38:38.240]  as we do here in Colorado.
[38:38.240 --> 38:39.240]  I don't know, fuck you up.
[38:39.240 --> 38:40.620]  If you can take some dabs, let's do it.
[38:40.620 --> 38:42.400]  If not, I'll roll a fat joint.
[38:42.400 --> 38:44.500]  We'll get stoned and hang out and talk about podcasting
[38:44.500 --> 38:46.680]  and talk about getting you guys jobs
[38:46.680 --> 38:48.760]  in the Colorado cannabis industry.
[38:48.820 --> 38:51.100]  Also, I really like the part about where you say,
[38:51.100 --> 38:54.460]  my podcast has taught you not only about cannabis,
[38:54.460 --> 38:56.060]  but how much we can help each other
[38:56.060 --> 38:58.340]  with just a little bit of kindness.
[38:58.340 --> 38:59.660]  That is fucking awesome to hear that people
[38:59.660 --> 39:01.360]  are catching on to that and picking that up
[39:01.360 --> 39:03.460]  just from my little podcast about cannabis.
[39:03.460 --> 39:05.940]  Little bit of subliminal messages never hurt.
[39:05.940 --> 39:08.100]  Take care of one another, be kind to each other,
[39:08.100 --> 39:10.660]  have each other's back, especially you folks down south,
[39:10.660 --> 39:12.600]  especially you folks in Texas.
[39:12.600 --> 39:14.300]  Everything's going fucking haywire right now.
[39:14.300 --> 39:16.760]  Everything's on fire, everything's underwater.
[39:16.780 --> 39:19.540]  I certainly hope everybody is okay.
[39:19.540 --> 39:20.660]  You guys, whatever you believe in,
[39:20.660 --> 39:22.520]  whoever you follow, whatever you love,
[39:22.520 --> 39:24.540]  if you're into Jesus, if you're into Buddha,
[39:24.540 --> 39:26.860]  if you're into Rastafari, whatever it is,
[39:26.860 --> 39:28.740]  I'm not picky, you do your thing,
[39:28.740 --> 39:30.580]  but please send some love to the people
[39:30.580 --> 39:31.520]  that need it right now.
[39:31.520 --> 39:32.940]  The world is going fucking crazy.
[39:32.940 --> 39:34.640]  There are a lot of people in turmoil.
[39:34.640 --> 39:36.020]  Send some love and light out there.
[39:36.020 --> 39:37.900]  Again, I don't care who you pray to.
[39:37.900 --> 39:38.940]  It doesn't matter to me.
[39:38.940 --> 39:41.220]  As long as you do it and as long as you mean it,
[39:41.220 --> 39:42.340]  send some positivity out there.
[39:42.340 --> 39:44.260]  As long as you're praying for good shit,
[39:44.260 --> 39:46.040]  as long as you're not trying to do terrible shit,
[39:46.060 --> 39:46.900]  I'm cool with you.
[39:46.900 --> 39:48.260]  I don't care what you call your guy.
[39:48.260 --> 39:50.020]  I don't care what color your skin is.
[39:50.020 --> 39:50.860]  It doesn't matter.
[39:50.860 --> 39:53.220]  Just send some love to the people that need it
[39:53.220 --> 39:54.420]  in the shitty times right now.
[39:54.420 --> 39:56.860]  All right, this email wraps up by saying,
[39:56.860 --> 40:00.460]  stay wide-eyed, smiley, and live life ivory growers love.
[40:00.460 --> 40:05.460]  You know I will stay smiley and always ivory forever.
[40:05.660 --> 40:07.060]  I want to thank you guys for those emails.
[40:07.060 --> 40:07.880]  That was great.
[40:07.880 --> 40:08.720]  Thanks for the great content.
[40:08.720 --> 40:11.720]  Thanks for helping me get people into the cannabis industry.
[40:12.620 --> 40:14.180]  Now here's where I'm gonna kind of sound like a dick.
[40:14.180 --> 40:15.700]  Colorado's getting full, you guys.
[40:16.360 --> 40:17.840]  All you people that are thinking about moving here,
[40:17.840 --> 40:19.340]  the traffic is getting horrendous.
[40:19.340 --> 40:20.740]  Rent is getting high.
[40:20.740 --> 40:23.640]  Everything is getting fucking crowded.
[40:23.640 --> 40:25.920]  Everything is getting more expensive.
[40:25.920 --> 40:27.760]  I would love for you to come here and participate
[40:27.760 --> 40:29.240]  and join us in Legal Cannabis
[40:29.240 --> 40:31.480]  and the beauty that these mountains have to offer
[40:31.480 --> 40:34.560]  and all of the fucking seasons you get to see here.
[40:34.560 --> 40:35.840]  I'm from California.
[40:35.840 --> 40:38.280]  We had spring and summer.
[40:38.280 --> 40:41.720]  In Colorado, we get every season highlighted really well.
[40:41.720 --> 40:43.240]  We get a huge winter.
[40:43.240 --> 40:44.080]  We get a summer.
[40:44.080 --> 40:44.900]  We get a fall.
[40:45.680 --> 40:46.760]  We get all the seasons.
[40:46.760 --> 40:49.280]  Come enjoy them if that's what you want to do.
[40:49.280 --> 40:52.320]  But I would recommend that you work
[40:52.320 --> 40:54.680]  on legalization where you are.
[40:54.680 --> 40:56.040]  If you can't come here,
[40:56.040 --> 40:59.060]  do what you can to legalize where you are.
[40:59.060 --> 41:01.720]  My hope is that eventually every state
[41:01.720 --> 41:03.420]  will be a cannabis legal state.
[41:03.420 --> 41:06.520]  Hopefully one day there won't be legalized states.
[41:06.520 --> 41:08.520]  It'll just be legalized cannabis
[41:08.520 --> 41:10.600]  in the United States of America statewide.
[41:10.600 --> 41:13.800]  You'll be able to travel from California to New York
[41:13.820 --> 41:15.940]  with your bong in the car, with your weed in the car,
[41:15.940 --> 41:17.540]  and nobody will give a fuck,
[41:17.540 --> 41:18.580]  unless you're hitting it, of course.
[41:18.580 --> 41:20.100]  That's not cool, but you can have it.
[41:20.100 --> 41:21.540]  You can have it in the car, and that's what matters.
[41:21.540 --> 41:23.860]  I need to be able to drive from here to California
[41:23.860 --> 41:26.460]  with my hash and my rig in a container
[41:26.460 --> 41:27.380]  that is locked and sealed
[41:27.380 --> 41:29.660]  so that I'm not consuming on the road and have it safe
[41:29.660 --> 41:31.140]  and not have to worry about going to jail
[41:31.140 --> 41:33.020]  just because I'm carrying my medicine with me
[41:33.020 --> 41:34.120]  to keep my head right.
[41:35.140 --> 41:36.180]  That's what I think.
[41:36.180 --> 41:37.660]  I'm not trying to say don't come.
[41:37.660 --> 41:39.100]  I'm just saying if you can't,
[41:39.100 --> 41:40.700]  do what you can to get it legal where you are.
[41:40.700 --> 41:42.120]  Because if everybody keeps coming here,
[41:42.120 --> 41:43.660]  we're going to have a bunch of states that aren't legal.
[41:44.500 --> 41:46.400]  Everyone that wants cannabis is just going to the places
[41:46.400 --> 41:47.520]  where it's legal.
[41:47.520 --> 41:49.200]  You got to fight for your own place.
[41:49.200 --> 41:50.400]  Some of you need to fight for your own place.
[41:50.400 --> 41:52.000]  Stick around, get it going there.
[41:52.000 --> 41:52.840]  I invite you here.
[41:52.840 --> 41:53.800]  If you want to come here, come on.
[41:53.800 --> 41:54.640]  It's fucking rad here.
[41:54.640 --> 41:55.680]  We're having fun.
[41:55.680 --> 41:58.120]  But you could also stay where you are,
[41:58.120 --> 41:59.280]  fight for your own place.
[41:59.280 --> 42:00.580]  Just an idea.
[42:00.580 --> 42:01.420]  But you know what?
[42:01.420 --> 42:02.240]  As long as you're on Team Green,
[42:02.240 --> 42:03.440]  as long as you're fighting for cannabis,
[42:03.440 --> 42:04.520]  I don't care where you do it.
[42:04.520 --> 42:06.040]  Let's just legalize it everywhere.
[42:06.040 --> 42:07.360]  Do it here, do it there.
[42:07.360 --> 42:09.400]  Just be on the same team as me, and I'm cool with you.
[42:09.400 --> 42:11.120]  I'm not picky about how or where you do it.
[42:11.120 --> 42:12.520]  Don't be a dickhead about it, though.
[42:12.940 --> 42:15.500]  Don't be a black eye or an eyesore on our community.
[42:15.500 --> 42:17.020]  Kind of try to be responsible.
[42:17.020 --> 42:19.980]  Be an adult about cannabis wherever you do it.
[42:19.980 --> 42:21.620]  All right, you guys, I am fucking rambling.
[42:21.620 --> 42:23.260]  I want to thank you guys for listening to this podcast.
[42:23.260 --> 42:25.340]  Thanks for listening to episode number 243
[42:25.340 --> 42:27.060]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[42:27.060 --> 42:28.340]  Before I wrap up the podcast,
[42:28.340 --> 42:30.360]  I owe a huge thank you to everybody
[42:30.360 --> 42:31.940]  who's been contributing to Patreon.
[42:31.940 --> 42:34.220]  I've got some great Patreon contributors.
[42:34.220 --> 42:35.860]  They've been at it for several months now.
[42:35.860 --> 42:38.220]  I appreciate each and every one of you.
[42:38.220 --> 42:39.900]  If you don't know what Patreon is,
[42:39.920 --> 42:42.240]  Patreon is a way that you as a listener
[42:42.240 --> 42:44.680]  can financially contribute to the podcast.
[42:44.680 --> 42:46.520]  I'm not trying to get rich off of podcasting,
[42:46.520 --> 42:48.880]  although it would be nice, that's not my goal.
[42:48.880 --> 42:50.600]  I want to help you guys grow better cannabis.
[42:50.600 --> 42:53.000]  I want to help you legalize cannabis nationwide.
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.960]  I want to be a good spokesperson for cannabis.
[42:54.960 --> 42:56.560]  That's my job here.
[42:56.560 --> 42:58.040]  What I'm asking for funding for
[42:58.040 --> 42:59.440]  is to help pay for my website,
[42:59.440 --> 43:02.180]  to help pay for these little fuzzy things over my microphone.
[43:02.180 --> 43:04.000]  Just simple stuff like that.
[43:04.000 --> 43:05.520]  The water bottles that I buy for the guests
[43:05.520 --> 43:06.640]  when the guests come over.
[43:06.640 --> 43:08.300]  Just I want to help offset those costs.
[43:08.300 --> 43:09.180]  If you don't want to help,
[43:09.200 --> 43:10.520]  I'll gladly do it out of my pocket
[43:10.520 --> 43:12.400]  because I love podcasting, I love cannabis,
[43:12.400 --> 43:13.400]  and I love you guys,
[43:13.400 --> 43:14.760]  and I want you to grow better cannabis,
[43:14.760 --> 43:16.120]  and I want to give you free help.
[43:16.120 --> 43:17.400]  There are a few people out there
[43:17.400 --> 43:18.720]  that do want to contribute.
[43:18.720 --> 43:21.200]  They can do so by going to patreon.com
[43:21.200 --> 43:22.640]  slash grow from your heart.
[43:22.640 --> 43:24.480]  All of the information you need to contribute
[43:24.480 --> 43:25.640]  will be right there,
[43:25.640 --> 43:27.840]  and I appreciate your contributions.
[43:27.840 --> 43:29.520]  And once again, I'll use those contributions
[43:29.520 --> 43:32.040]  to pay for the website, which is where I host the show,
[43:32.040 --> 43:34.840]  which is how you're able to listen for free.
[43:34.840 --> 43:36.040]  So once again, big thanks to everybody
[43:36.040 --> 43:37.800]  who has contributed to Patreon.

[44:21.680 --> 44:24.440]  Storm shadow is white widow crossed to the arise.
