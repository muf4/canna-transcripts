[00:05.950 --> 00:25.900]  Hi, Leho Podcast World.
[00:25.900 --> 00:28.580]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:28.580 --> 00:33.540]  This is episode 728 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:33.540 --> 00:36.740]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on more listener emails.
[00:36.740 --> 00:40.260]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:40.260 --> 00:44.560]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:44.560 --> 00:48.560]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to our friend

[01:11.280 --> 01:15.480]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out
[01:15.480 --> 01:17.440]  to TheDadHays.
[01:17.440 --> 01:22.160]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:51.840 --> 01:56.160]  I'm going to try to blow out the merch store, clean out a bunch of stuff so that I can upgrade,
[01:56.160 --> 01:58.320]  update, and replace a lot of things.
[01:58.320 --> 02:03.440]  So if you are a patron, pay attention for the month of April, you will get a great coupon
[02:03.440 --> 02:04.840]  code.
[02:04.840 --> 02:08.360]  I want to do a big shout out to everybody who showed up for the Groovy Gravy Secret
[02:08.360 --> 02:09.840]  Stash event.
[02:09.840 --> 02:11.080]  I'm sure it was a great event.
[02:11.080 --> 02:12.960]  Of course I am recording ahead of time.
[02:12.960 --> 02:16.200]  So in anticipation, I'm sure it was a great event.
[02:16.200 --> 02:18.080]  Thanks to everybody that showed up.
[02:18.080 --> 02:24.200]  Look forward in the future for a full review of the Groovy Gravy Secret Stash event.
[02:24.200 --> 02:27.640]  I am recording ahead of time, but that will happen before this comes out.
[02:27.640 --> 02:32.480]  So there will be a time vortex and then we will talk about it in what will be the future.
[02:32.800 --> 02:34.440]  All right, let's get back on track.
[02:34.440 --> 02:37.040]  In the real world, I may have mentioned this in a previous episode.
[02:37.040 --> 02:42.800]  I did ask our friend Pedro to record a video about cleaning our rig and our banger.
[02:42.800 --> 02:46.880]  So hopefully in the near future here, when Pedro has some time this weekend, which already
[02:46.880 --> 02:51.200]  happened when this video comes out, see how weird production time can be.
[02:51.200 --> 02:55.240]  Pedro will make a video to teach us how to clean our glass, how to keep our rigs, our
[02:55.240 --> 02:56.240]  banger clean.
[02:56.240 --> 02:57.720]  He's given me some great advice.
[02:57.720 --> 02:59.280]  I just told him, make a video for me, bro.
[02:59.280 --> 03:00.640]  We'll show this to everybody.
[03:00.640 --> 03:01.640]  He will get that going.
[03:01.640 --> 03:03.720]  I will get that out to you as soon as possible.
[03:03.720 --> 03:05.720]  So do look forward to that.
[03:05.720 --> 03:08.440]  Also look forward to feminized seeds.
[03:08.440 --> 03:09.440]  That's right.
[03:09.440 --> 03:11.480]  I've got a lot of fem seeds out there in testing.
[03:11.480 --> 03:12.680]  There's new stuff being tested.
[03:12.680 --> 03:17.720]  I am also making restocks of a lot of the things that are in demand.
[03:17.720 --> 03:19.640]  The Lemon Jeffrey will be restocked.
[03:19.640 --> 03:21.480]  Golden Goat will be restocked.
[03:21.480 --> 03:23.560]  Orange Gasm will be restocked.
[03:23.560 --> 03:26.440]  Red and Blue Pills will be officially released.
[03:26.440 --> 03:29.520]  And there is more stuff in the room to be pollinated that I will not mention at this
[03:29.520 --> 03:30.520]  time.
[03:30.520 --> 03:32.240]  The reversal is working.
[03:32.240 --> 03:33.640]  The project is underway.
[03:33.640 --> 03:35.200]  Things look good.
[03:35.200 --> 03:38.240]  The reversed plant is showing me that it is reversing.
[03:38.240 --> 03:39.360]  It is showing that it's working.
[03:39.360 --> 03:43.480]  There are male parts or pollen parts popping up on this female plant.
[03:43.480 --> 03:44.480]  It looks successful.
[03:44.480 --> 03:46.920]  I have dragged the female plants into the room.
[03:46.920 --> 03:48.720]  The pollen receivers are in there.
[03:48.720 --> 03:52.800]  I am debating if they will get their final spray, one more spray.
[03:52.800 --> 03:54.560]  They've gotten sprayed up to day 21.
[03:54.560 --> 03:57.240]  I'm not sure if they're going to get sprayed on day 24 or not.
[03:57.240 --> 03:59.440]  It looks like it's working.
[03:59.440 --> 04:01.960]  That's a game time decision to be made right there.
[04:01.960 --> 04:02.960]  Maybe hit one of them.
[04:02.960 --> 04:03.960]  Don't hit the other two.
[04:03.960 --> 04:04.960]  That's something we'll think about.
[04:04.960 --> 04:07.320]  Document, mark down, take good notes of.
[04:07.320 --> 04:09.820]  But the FEM project is working.
[04:09.820 --> 04:14.080]  That means that there will be feminized seeds in a little bit of time.
[04:14.080 --> 04:17.440]  The plants do need to get mature enough to accept the pollen.
[04:17.440 --> 04:19.480]  The pollen donors need to make the pollen.
[04:19.480 --> 04:21.920]  There needs to be a little bit of action happening there.
[04:21.920 --> 04:24.720]  Then, of course, we've got six to eight weeks for seeds to be made.
[04:24.720 --> 04:26.160]  Then we've got harvest time, dry time.
[04:26.160 --> 04:27.400]  I said harvest time.
[04:27.400 --> 04:29.640]  I apologize if you heard that grossness.
[04:29.640 --> 04:33.680]  We do have dry and cure time, packaging time, all that good stuff to keep in mind also.
[04:33.680 --> 04:34.800]  But it's happening.
[04:34.800 --> 04:35.800]  They are coming.
[04:35.800 --> 04:39.680]  A lot of people ask me about the Lemon Jeffrey, Golden Goat, Orange Chasm FEMs.
[04:39.680 --> 04:40.680]  They're hot.
[04:40.680 --> 04:41.680]  They're sought after.
[04:41.680 --> 04:42.680]  I get a lot of emails.
[04:42.680 --> 04:43.680]  People on the show ask.
[04:43.680 --> 04:44.680]  People that listen ask.
[04:44.680 --> 04:45.680]  So stay tuned.
[04:45.680 --> 04:46.680]  They are coming.
[04:46.680 --> 04:47.680]  I am making them.
[04:47.680 --> 04:49.920]  Also, there is more stuff to be released.
[04:49.920 --> 04:51.120]  Do I want to say it here on the show?
[04:51.120 --> 04:52.120]  Why not?
[04:52.120 --> 04:53.480]  This is one of the best platforms to release stuff.
[04:53.480 --> 04:56.640]  I made Afterglow feminized seeds.
[04:56.880 --> 04:57.880]  That's right.
[04:57.880 --> 04:58.880]  I made the Afterglow.
[04:58.880 --> 05:03.800]  That is the, it is a, let's say, Clementine female pollinated by the Arise male.
[05:03.800 --> 05:08.040]  It's Clementine to Arise, Clementine to King Solomon, made Afterglow.
[05:08.040 --> 05:10.400]  Shout out to Mike for coining the name Afterglow.
[05:10.400 --> 05:13.240]  He said that in a conversation one day and I said, you shut up with that word.
[05:13.240 --> 05:14.960]  I'm going to use that as a strain name.
[05:14.960 --> 05:17.480]  It became the Afterglow.
[05:17.480 --> 05:19.320]  I made a bunch of Afterglow seeds.
[05:19.320 --> 05:23.400]  Somehow magically, I got a bunch of those seeds to our friend, the Painted Lady.
[05:23.400 --> 05:26.080]  The Painted Lady grew the shit out of the Afterglow.
[05:26.080 --> 05:29.400]  She found a keeper in there that was amazing.
[05:29.400 --> 05:32.480]  Somehow magically, I acquired that keeper from her.
[05:32.480 --> 05:36.860]  I took that keeper of the Afterglow and I reversed it and I made Afterglow S1s and I
[05:36.860 --> 05:41.040]  also outcrossed it to a bunch of magical stuff.
[05:41.040 --> 05:42.040]  So stay tuned.
[05:42.040 --> 05:43.180]  Some of those will be released.
[05:43.180 --> 05:45.440]  Some of those, some of them have already been tested.
[05:45.440 --> 05:47.280]  They're out there as testers getting ran now.
[05:47.280 --> 05:50.080]  Some are just getting sent out, but stay tuned.
[05:50.080 --> 05:52.320]  A lot of that stuff, the Afterglow will be released.
[05:52.320 --> 05:54.720]  The outcrosses are being tested now.
[05:54.720 --> 05:55.720]  Lots of great fems coming.
[05:56.360 --> 05:59.240]  So you guys that are asking, guys and gals that are asking for feminized seeds, you will
[05:59.240 --> 06:02.680]  have a nice menu very, very soon.
[06:02.680 --> 06:03.680]  Where do we go from here?
[06:03.680 --> 06:05.560]  I've got a lot of stuff to talk about.
[06:05.560 --> 06:07.800]  Let's jump into the email portion of this podcast.
[06:07.800 --> 06:10.560]  I do have a good message right here in front of me.
[06:10.560 --> 06:12.280]  This one may be more of a compliment.
[06:12.280 --> 06:14.960]  This one came from our friend, Ask Kickerson.
[06:14.960 --> 06:16.540]  Big up to my buddy, Ask Kickerson.
[06:16.540 --> 06:19.400]  You keep kicking Ask Kickerson arse out there.
[06:19.400 --> 06:21.080]  However you want to do it, you keep doing it.
[06:21.080 --> 06:23.200]  The message goes a lot like this.
[06:23.200 --> 06:26.240]  It says, you can use my name, but I don't need this on the podcast.
[06:26.240 --> 06:30.080]  Well, it's going to be on the podcast because I want to read one of these compliments that's
[06:30.080 --> 06:32.680]  in here just because a lot of people think I'm crazy.
[06:32.680 --> 06:35.480]  And this does kind of back up one of my statements.
[06:35.480 --> 06:38.000]  It says, first and foremost, I have to say thank you.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.520]  I've been growing for years now.
[06:40.520 --> 06:41.520]  Then he mentions where he is.
[06:41.520 --> 06:42.520]  We're not going to talk about that.
[06:42.520 --> 06:43.840]  I'm going to skip some of this.
[06:43.840 --> 06:47.640]  Then it says, I'm working my way back through the catalog in reverse order.
[06:47.640 --> 06:49.800]  So I'm around 520 now.
[06:49.800 --> 06:54.360]  The point is I've heard you mention switching to 18-6 at the end of flower for a week or
[06:54.360 --> 06:55.360]  more.
[06:55.360 --> 06:56.360]  Yes.
[06:56.360 --> 07:00.520]  In one episode, I do mention turning your timer back to 18-6 during the flush phase.
[07:00.520 --> 07:05.680]  When you begin flushing your plants, turn your light timer to 18 hours on and six hours
[07:05.680 --> 07:07.440]  off.
[07:07.440 --> 07:09.040]  I do get a lot of feedback.
[07:09.040 --> 07:10.440]  A lot of people think I'm crazy.
[07:10.440 --> 07:14.440]  A lot of people talk a lot of trash to me for this method, but all of the people that
[07:14.440 --> 07:18.420]  talk shit about this method, about this advice, refuse to try it.
[07:18.540 --> 07:20.580]  You can't talk shit until you try something.
[07:20.580 --> 07:24.300]  At least put one or two plants in there and prove me wrong before you talk shit to me.
[07:24.300 --> 07:25.300]  That is my theory.
[07:25.300 --> 07:26.980]  I've done it and it works for me.
[07:26.980 --> 07:31.740]  So if you're just talking and you haven't done it, that is not really, don't even bother
[07:31.740 --> 07:32.900]  messaging me with that.
[07:32.900 --> 07:37.900]  Anyway, our friend here says, I have grown out the same cut four times and I've never
[07:37.900 --> 07:40.700]  had the buds swell at the end like this.
[07:40.700 --> 07:43.420]  If this mic wasn't on a stand, I would fucking drop it.
[07:43.420 --> 07:45.620]  It would just be never had the buds swell like this.
[07:45.620 --> 07:47.300]  Mic drop, it'd be over right there.
[07:47.300 --> 07:51.420]  I'd hear the thud and then some dope ass music would play and I would walk off.
[07:51.420 --> 07:52.420]  We have a supporter here.
[07:52.420 --> 07:57.220]  Our friend backs up my statement that changing the timer to 18 hours on and six hours off
[07:57.220 --> 08:02.220]  for the last 10 to 14 days of flower will bulk up and increase your buds.
[08:02.220 --> 08:06.740]  So this guy says, I have never had buds swell at the end like this.
[08:06.740 --> 08:08.100]  I'm getting rambly here, bro.
[08:08.100 --> 08:09.580]  Welcome to the party.
[08:09.580 --> 08:13.740]  But these days, while I do grow for head stash and a couple of the homies, I also have two
[08:13.740 --> 08:16.100]  cancer patients in my life that I grow for.
[08:16.660 --> 08:20.860]  Big up, congratulations and thank you for putting in the effort, the time, the energy,
[08:20.860 --> 08:24.380]  the compassion, the dedication to grow for other people.
[08:24.380 --> 08:26.660]  Growing for ourselves, growing for money, growing for profit.
[08:26.660 --> 08:27.660]  That's really easy.
[08:27.660 --> 08:31.860]  Growing a product, you're putting in time, energy, effort, electricity, money, possibly
[08:31.860 --> 08:32.980]  a risk.
[08:32.980 --> 08:37.620]  You're dedicating your space, your plant count, your numbers to another person, to two other
[08:37.620 --> 08:38.860]  sick people.
[08:38.860 --> 08:40.100]  That's commendable.
[08:40.100 --> 08:41.100]  That's respectable.
[08:41.100 --> 08:42.660]  So big up, shout out for doing that.
[08:42.660 --> 08:45.060]  You could have gotten stingy and use that space for profit.
[08:45.060 --> 08:47.140]  That plant, that space is profitable.
[08:47.140 --> 08:50.420]  You're doing it to give that product to a sick person because they have cancer.
[08:50.420 --> 08:51.420]  That is great.
[08:51.420 --> 08:52.420]  That's good karma.
[08:52.420 --> 08:53.420]  That's what it's all about.
[08:53.420 --> 08:54.460]  That is growing from your heart, my friend.
[08:54.460 --> 08:55.460]  So big up for that.
[08:55.460 --> 08:57.060]  I apologize if I seem distracted.
[08:57.060 --> 09:00.540]  I'm expecting a delivery and they will not leave it if I don't sign for it.
[09:00.540 --> 09:01.540]  Let's keep moving.
[09:01.540 --> 09:04.340]  It does say, I also have two cancer patients.
[09:04.340 --> 09:07.340]  Being able to help them just a little bit more brings tears to my eyes.
[09:07.340 --> 09:11.600]  Honestly, as soon as I noticed it working, I promptly joined the Patreon and ordered
[09:11.600 --> 09:12.600]  some iRegenetics.
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.920]  Bro, I can support the statement of knowing what it's like to grow for somebody.
[09:17.920 --> 09:22.600]  I was lucky enough, fortunate enough, blessed enough to be involved in the very first dispensary
[09:22.600 --> 09:23.600]  here in this city.
[09:23.600 --> 09:27.520]  There were some folks that had the right idea, but they didn't have the right, they had the
[09:27.520 --> 09:28.520]  right idea.
[09:28.520 --> 09:29.520]  They just needed some pushes.
[09:29.520 --> 09:32.800]  I'm kind of younger, hipper, had more energy, more experience.
[09:32.800 --> 09:33.800]  I'd been to more dispensaries.
[09:33.800 --> 09:35.480]  They had the funding and the idea.
[09:35.480 --> 09:37.520]  They didn't know how to really set up a dispensary.
[09:37.520 --> 09:40.240]  They kind of handed me the keys and let me do it.
[09:40.240 --> 09:45.560]  I got the privilege to meet every medical marijuana patient in my city, it felt like.
[09:45.560 --> 09:48.800]  Some of them were 70-year-old old ladies.
[09:48.800 --> 09:51.640]  I don't mean to call you old ladies, but that describes what they were.
[09:51.640 --> 09:54.240]  Lovely, gracious 70-year-old senior ladies.
[09:54.240 --> 09:55.600]  Is that the more polite way to say it?
[09:55.600 --> 09:56.600]  Sorry, ladies.
[09:56.600 --> 10:03.960]  There were also 70-year-old veterans, 70-year-old firefighters, 70-year-old ex-gangsters, 70-year-old
[10:03.960 --> 10:04.960]  city council members.
[10:04.960 --> 10:05.960]  What?
[10:05.960 --> 10:06.960]  City council members came?
[10:06.960 --> 10:08.040]  I'm not supposed to say that, but they may have popped in.
[10:08.040 --> 10:11.200]  You don't know who they are or which one they was.
[10:11.200 --> 10:12.960]  There were a lot of people popped in.
[10:12.960 --> 10:15.280]  Also, I got 35-year-old construction workers.
[10:15.280 --> 10:19.620]  I got people that I think may have been a cop sometimes, came and bought cannabis legally
[10:19.620 --> 10:21.500]  with a medical marijuana card.
[10:21.500 --> 10:25.580]  There were 21-year-old dudes that would jog up and buy weed and jog right on out.
[10:25.580 --> 10:26.680]  I got to meet everybody.
[10:26.680 --> 10:28.420]  I got to see the entire community.
[10:28.420 --> 10:32.080]  Every type of condition you could imagine, I got to see that come into my dispensary.
[10:32.080 --> 10:34.240]  I got to interact with them and talk with them.
[10:34.240 --> 10:38.960]  I got to develop actual relationships with a lot of these people.
[10:38.960 --> 10:42.560]  The older people that slow down and take their time and talk to you and they're not in a
[10:42.560 --> 10:45.960]  rush to get out and get back on Twitter and Instagram or whatever the new fucking thing
[10:45.960 --> 10:49.280]  we're scrolling on, get in the car and play the new track and drive fast.
[10:49.280 --> 10:51.880]  The older people, we really had time to connect.
[10:51.880 --> 10:56.360]  They would tell me, I smoked this one and it didn't help much, but I smoked this one
[10:56.360 --> 10:58.520]  and I feel a lot better.
[10:58.520 --> 11:00.420]  Sometimes people would come with their significant other.
[11:00.420 --> 11:03.840]  Older people that are sick would come with their wife or their husband or their caretaker
[11:03.840 --> 11:07.480]  and they would say, since you gave us this strain, since you've been smoking this lemon,
[11:07.480 --> 11:11.960]  Jeffrey, my dad, my husband, my wife has been a lot better of a person, a lot easier to
[11:11.960 --> 11:13.280]  get along with.
[11:13.280 --> 11:17.840]  We would see medicine that we would grow and recommend improve the quality of people's
[11:17.840 --> 11:19.920]  lives and that is what it's all about.
[11:19.920 --> 11:22.160]  I almost said that's what it was all about.
[11:22.160 --> 11:26.320]  That's what it is all about when it comes to recreational and medical cannabis is improving
[11:26.320 --> 11:27.760]  the quality of people's lives.
[11:27.760 --> 11:31.920]  Whether it's a healthy person like myself who's got some bodily pain, I smoke to relieve
[11:31.920 --> 11:32.920]  pain.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.680]  Whether it's people that are just smoking because they've got some other issues, whatever
[11:35.680 --> 11:40.740]  we're smoking for, people have cancer, AIDS, cachexia, a lot of other crazy shit.
[11:40.740 --> 11:43.720]  Whatever you're smoking for, as long as it improves the quality of your life, that is
[11:43.720 --> 11:44.720]  the goal here.
[11:44.720 --> 11:49.940]  So big up for taking energy, time, effort out of your day and having some compassion
[11:49.940 --> 11:51.420]  to take care of these other people, bro.
[11:51.420 --> 11:54.660]  That means a lot to me and I get to see exactly what you're talking about.
[11:54.660 --> 12:00.720]  People would come in and the first visit, they would be intimidated, scared, confused.
[12:00.720 --> 12:03.240]  They wouldn't know what they were talking about, what they were buying.
[12:03.240 --> 12:06.500]  They would know they feel like shit and they're down to try medical marijuana, maybe that
[12:06.500 --> 12:07.500]  will help.
[12:07.500 --> 12:10.960]  By the fifth or sixth time they came in to see me, they would high five me, they would
[12:10.960 --> 12:13.000]  skip in, be like, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.000]  Good to see you, bro.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.480]  I need to get an eighth of the Lemon Jeffrey and an eighth of this OG Kush and I'll see
[12:17.480 --> 12:20.960]  you in a couple days and they do fucking cartwheels and skip out and I'd be like, that's a completely
[12:20.960 --> 12:22.280]  different person.
[12:22.280 --> 12:27.060]  The person that came in here before seemed almost defeated almost.
[12:27.060 --> 12:30.620]  Their illness, their ailment was winning and now that we've got them on cannabis, their
[12:30.620 --> 12:33.940]  body is better, their spirit is better, their relationships are better.
[12:33.940 --> 12:36.060]  So I got to see that firsthand.
[12:36.060 --> 12:37.780]  You said you were rambling, bro.
[12:37.780 --> 12:39.100]  Talk about a ramble fest.
[12:39.100 --> 12:40.100]  Thank you.
[12:40.100 --> 12:44.260]  I really, I love thinking and talking about those old days of when the medical market
[12:44.260 --> 12:49.940]  started developing because I really do enjoy, did enjoy developing those relationships with
[12:49.940 --> 12:50.940]  people.
[12:50.940 --> 12:53.660]  Now I'm recommending seeds and things like that, but when people ask me about cannabis
[12:53.660 --> 12:57.060]  and get me going about this, I really do like it.
[12:57.060 --> 13:01.060]  I walked into somewhere the other day, I'd been on the road for like three hours and
[13:01.060 --> 13:03.060]  I walked in and I was like, Hey, I'm here.
[13:03.060 --> 13:06.940]  And I didn't get my bag set down and my shoes kicked off before somebody was like, Hey,
[13:06.940 --> 13:07.940]  you're the weed guy.
[13:07.940 --> 13:08.940]  I want to know about this.
[13:08.940 --> 13:10.060]  And I, it didn't even phase me.
[13:10.060 --> 13:11.980]  I just clicked into like from traffic mode.
[13:11.980 --> 13:13.580]  I was in fuck this traffic mode.
[13:13.580 --> 13:17.260]  You ever been in traffic where you just want to throw bricks at the cars just because they're
[13:17.260 --> 13:18.260]  cars?
[13:18.260 --> 13:19.260]  You're like, why do you have wheels and doors?
[13:19.260 --> 13:20.260]  You're so stupid.
[13:20.500 --> 13:22.180]  That's how I felt about the traffic that day.
[13:22.180 --> 13:23.180]  But I digress.
[13:23.180 --> 13:25.540]  Uh, when I got into the place, somebody was like, you're the weed guy.
[13:25.540 --> 13:26.540]  I have weed questions.
[13:26.540 --> 13:28.100]  Here's questions one through seven.
[13:28.100 --> 13:29.100]  I didn't flinch.
[13:29.100 --> 13:30.100]  I didn't hesitate.
[13:30.100 --> 13:31.100]  I kindly kicked off my shoes.
[13:31.100 --> 13:32.260]  I set my bag down.
[13:32.260 --> 13:35.900]  I sat down and I looked them in the face and I explained everything I fucking knew about
[13:35.900 --> 13:36.900]  their questions.
[13:36.900 --> 13:37.900]  I just love talking about it.
[13:37.900 --> 13:39.420]  They were kind of new at cannabis.
[13:39.420 --> 13:40.420]  They needed guidance.
[13:40.420 --> 13:44.060]  I definitely had the answers and I just could not shut up about it and it was perfect.
[13:44.060 --> 13:45.380]  I really enjoyed that.
[13:45.380 --> 13:47.420]  So a bro, thank you for the great reminder.
[13:47.420 --> 13:49.660]  My friend at ours, kicker sin.
[13:49.660 --> 13:54.540]  Thank you for the reminder of how much I enjoy the connection of recommending strains and
[13:54.540 --> 13:55.540]  then seeing a person.
[13:55.540 --> 13:58.780]  I would give you two or three strains and give them to you on a discount price and send
[13:58.780 --> 14:00.700]  you home and let you smoke them.
[14:00.700 --> 14:03.820]  Sometimes back in the day, bro, we could smoke those strains in the dispensary and see what
[14:03.820 --> 14:07.300]  you liked, but then you'd come back and have reports and then we'd improve the quality
[14:07.300 --> 14:08.420]  of your life.
[14:08.420 --> 14:09.420]  That's what it's all about.
[14:09.420 --> 14:14.860]  So thank you for reminding me that sometimes it did bring tears to my eyes to see the improvements
[14:14.860 --> 14:17.140]  that we could give to people's quality of life.
[14:17.860 --> 14:22.100]  And then also bro, thank you for supporting the fact that 18 six at the end of flower
[14:22.100 --> 14:23.260]  is a great idea.
[14:23.260 --> 14:26.820]  You guys, if you haven't seen that episode, I will link it to this show at the end of
[14:26.820 --> 14:27.820]  the episode.
[14:27.820 --> 14:31.860]  It does give me the opportunity to put the subscribe and then the next video up here.
[14:31.860 --> 14:35.260]  I'll do my best to put the correct video right up here.
[14:35.260 --> 14:36.660]  I'm not sure which side it will go on.
[14:36.660 --> 14:39.740]  I haven't figured that out yet because it reverses and then what the hell is going to
[14:39.740 --> 14:43.300]  happen, but I'll put the 18 six on the screen at the end of the video.
[14:43.300 --> 14:44.700]  So you can just click that.
[14:44.700 --> 14:45.700]  Also make sure you subscribe.
[14:45.700 --> 14:46.700]  All right.
[14:47.260 --> 14:48.260]  I'm going to get this email here in front of me.
[14:48.260 --> 14:51.940]  Let's get to it because I am talking today.
[14:51.940 --> 14:53.220]  Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[14:53.220 --> 14:59.580]  Also, I've been smoking a whole bunch of lemon Jeffrey live Rosin out of a brand new rig.
[14:59.580 --> 15:02.100]  The past couple of days have been a little fuzzy.
[15:02.100 --> 15:05.940]  I bought a new rig and got a bunch of lemon Jeffrey concentrates on the same day.
[15:05.940 --> 15:07.700]  Yeah, I'm a spoiled brat.
[15:07.700 --> 15:12.820]  But since then I feel like I'm not sure if I'm time traveling or if I'm frozen in time
[15:12.820 --> 15:16.620]  or somewhere in between, but time isn't doing what it normally to my clock.
[15:17.540 --> 15:20.740]  It's more kind of like it's moving up and down in the spin motion.
[15:20.740 --> 15:22.900]  It is not consistent in any way.
[15:22.900 --> 15:23.940]  You guys don't care.
[15:23.940 --> 15:24.940]  Let me get to the point.
[15:24.940 --> 15:27.660]  This one says, hi, my name is Fred.
[15:27.660 --> 15:28.660]  What up, Fred?
[15:28.660 --> 15:29.660]  Good to meet you, bro.
[15:29.660 --> 15:30.660]  Thank you for listening to my podcast.
[15:30.660 --> 15:33.480]  Thank you for contributing with the great message.
[15:33.480 --> 15:34.480]  It does go on.
[15:34.480 --> 15:39.820]  It says, I am planning on working with a variety of cultivars soon, including scarlet begonias.
[15:39.820 --> 15:40.820]  What a great choice.
[15:40.820 --> 15:42.260]  I hope that works well for you.
[15:42.260 --> 15:46.820]  It says, my question, which insects would you make sure were present before beginning
[15:46.820 --> 15:49.580]  an outdoor plot or soon thereafter?
[15:49.580 --> 15:52.220]  I understand more research will be necessary.
[15:52.220 --> 15:55.700]  That is one of the keys I'm going to get to is research will be necessary is I've never
[15:55.700 --> 15:57.460]  worked with organic methods.
[15:57.460 --> 16:02.980]  However, is there a handful or a list of insect species that you or other commercial growers
[16:02.980 --> 16:05.540]  prefer to ensure a healthier garden?
[16:05.540 --> 16:09.620]  Perhaps I could foster a healthier yard in general as some of these species are already
[16:09.620 --> 16:11.540]  present in this environment.
[16:11.820 --> 16:15.300]  He says, I've got wasps and ladybugs and the list goes on.
[16:15.300 --> 16:19.620]  The thing is, you've seen the wasps and you have seen the ladybugs.
[16:19.620 --> 16:22.380]  You're already watching for waspis, which is what you should be doing.
[16:22.380 --> 16:24.000]  You know the ladybugs are there.
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.220]  They're basically harmless, but you can't see most of the harmful insects.
[16:29.220 --> 16:33.460]  The bugs that are really going to cause you problems are microscopic, the spider mites,
[16:33.460 --> 16:39.140]  the I don't even want to say the russet mites, the fungus gnats, the thrips, the what are
[16:39.140 --> 16:40.460]  the things you're going to run into?
[16:40.460 --> 16:41.460]  The mites, the rips, aphids.
[16:41.460 --> 16:43.340]  Aphids are very common outside.
[16:43.340 --> 16:45.300]  In Colorado, we get caterpillars.
[16:45.300 --> 16:49.260]  The caterpillars leave these little orange melon, they're melon caterpillars.
[16:49.260 --> 16:50.500]  They leave a melon worm in there.
[16:50.500 --> 16:51.500]  They turn orange.
[16:51.500 --> 16:52.820]  They eat the inside of your buds.
[16:52.820 --> 16:56.720]  I'm not exactly sure what those are, but we get a lot of those kinds of bugs here.
[16:56.720 --> 16:58.340]  Those are bugs that I would prepare to battle.
[16:58.340 --> 16:59.380]  I'm not sure where you are.
[16:59.380 --> 17:03.640]  You didn't tell me where you are, but then it says also as well, which host plants are
[17:03.640 --> 17:04.640]  your go-to?
[17:04.640 --> 17:06.420]  Thank you for the podcast and cheers.
[17:06.420 --> 17:07.420]  All right.
[17:07.420 --> 17:09.420]  Big disclaimer before I even delve too deeply into this.
[17:09.420 --> 17:11.900]  I am not an outdoor organic grower.
[17:11.900 --> 17:16.820]  I grow indoors with bottled nutrients and most of my pesticide prevention is honestly
[17:16.820 --> 17:21.300]  straight up sprayed pesticide applications until I move into flower.
[17:21.300 --> 17:27.980]  That's when we do play with the predator bugs, but I don't do this outdoors and I don't know
[17:27.980 --> 17:28.980]  where you are.
[17:28.980 --> 17:35.900]  One of the first things I'm going to recommend is find an insectiary near you.
[17:35.900 --> 17:43.220]  There is an insectiary near you that distributes bugs to greenhouses and farms for this purpose.
[17:43.220 --> 17:46.680]  I'm not sure if they're going to offer you the small order that you need, but you can
[17:46.680 --> 17:50.620]  get the information that you need from them and then find a retail provider from there.
[17:50.620 --> 17:56.440]  I can make other recommendations, but call an insectiary near you or call other farmers
[17:56.440 --> 18:00.060]  near you or perhaps get on the internet and do some research.
[18:00.060 --> 18:01.620]  What pests are coming to you?
[18:01.620 --> 18:02.620]  Be prepared.
[18:02.620 --> 18:05.500]  I already mentioned we're going to get mites, thrips, aphids, caterpillars.
[18:06.100 --> 18:07.100]  I don't know where you are.
[18:07.100 --> 18:09.820]  I don't know if there's a specific bug that comes where you are.
[18:09.820 --> 18:13.820]  Every region is going to have an extra attacker that the farmers there know about.
[18:13.820 --> 18:17.380]  I know about the caterpillars here because I hear people bitch about it every year here.
[18:17.380 --> 18:19.580]  I know that that's a thing.
[18:19.580 --> 18:22.820]  Do some research and be prepared for what bugs are going to come your way.
[18:22.820 --> 18:27.020]  Also keep in mind, we also get grasshoppers.
[18:27.020 --> 18:29.380]  I couldn't think of what fucking grasshoppers were.
[18:29.380 --> 18:31.380]  We get a lot of grasshoppers here in Pueblo.
[18:31.380 --> 18:34.780]  Midsummer there'll just be a gang of grasshoppers appear out of nowhere.
[18:34.780 --> 18:36.500]  We also get deer in this area.
[18:36.500 --> 18:37.900]  We also get bear in this area.
[18:37.900 --> 18:38.900]  It sounds crazy.
[18:38.900 --> 18:41.980]  I live in the city, but a few miles that way, you'll see bear and they'll get into your
[18:41.980 --> 18:42.980]  grow.
[18:42.980 --> 18:43.980]  That shit smells good.
[18:43.980 --> 18:44.980]  They want to see what it is.
[18:44.980 --> 18:47.740]  If you're feeding it organics, it smells real good and the bears really want to know what
[18:47.740 --> 18:48.740]  it is.
[18:48.740 --> 18:52.980]  If you used a fish product and you live by the river and you're in Colorado, expect a
[18:52.980 --> 18:54.320]  bear to come up to that shit.
[18:54.320 --> 18:56.660]  That's very likely, very possible.
[18:56.660 --> 19:02.780]  We get deer, bear, rabbits, grasshoppers, then all kinds of small rodents and ground
[19:02.780 --> 19:06.740]  dwelling animals, just low fucking low, small stuff, skunks and shit like that.
[19:06.740 --> 19:07.740]  We'll eat your weed plants.
[19:07.740 --> 19:10.180]  Cats, cats will eat the fucking weed plants.
[19:10.180 --> 19:12.980]  I've seen plenty of cats and weed grows.
[19:12.980 --> 19:17.780]  So my first piece of advice is to see what bugs, what pests, what problems may be present,
[19:17.780 --> 19:19.340]  who may show up.
[19:19.340 --> 19:21.620]  You can Google that probably through the internet.
[19:21.620 --> 19:23.260]  There may be a growers group in your area.
[19:23.260 --> 19:25.660]  I don't know if it's legal or illegal and I don't know where you are.
[19:25.660 --> 19:29.740]  So half of my recommendations are going to be vague, but find what bugs are coming.
[19:29.740 --> 19:31.840]  Find what problems are coming.
[19:32.440 --> 19:38.920]  Then also do some research with that insectiary, other grows, forums, websites to find out
[19:38.920 --> 19:43.440]  what bugs, predator bugs will do well in your neighborhood.
[19:43.440 --> 19:45.960]  We could release all of the predator bugs on the planet.
[19:45.960 --> 19:50.240]  We could spend a million bucks, but doorbell, I'll be right back.
[19:50.240 --> 19:51.240]  All right.
[19:51.240 --> 19:52.240]  I apologize for that.
[19:52.240 --> 19:53.240]  The doorbell did ring.
[19:53.240 --> 19:54.240]  I was expecting a delivery.
[19:54.240 --> 19:55.240]  It is here.
[19:55.240 --> 19:56.240]  Now I can focus more on the show.
[19:56.240 --> 19:57.600]  I got the package I needed.
[19:57.600 --> 19:58.600]  I'm excited.
[19:58.600 --> 20:01.200]  I may show you that in a future episode.
[20:01.560 --> 20:02.560]  Let's get back where I was.
[20:02.560 --> 20:03.560]  What was I saying?
[20:03.560 --> 20:07.720]  I said you can order a million dollars worth of predator insects to try to guard your garden,
[20:07.720 --> 20:08.920]  your outdoor plot.
[20:08.920 --> 20:13.960]  But if they are not the appropriate insects for your environment, they may die.
[20:13.960 --> 20:15.120]  They may fly away.
[20:15.120 --> 20:16.600]  They may just crawl away.
[20:16.600 --> 20:17.760]  They may not even stick around.
[20:17.760 --> 20:19.960]  They may get eaten by other bugs.
[20:19.960 --> 20:23.600]  They may battle each other if you get the wrong combination of things.
[20:23.600 --> 20:27.900]  So I would do a little bit of research on what predator bugs will work well in your
[20:27.900 --> 20:28.900]  area.
[20:28.900 --> 20:32.140]  I know that sounds crazy, but an insectiary would give you good advice.
[20:32.140 --> 20:36.700]  They would say, hey, these bugs work well in your heat, your humidity, in your environment.
[20:36.700 --> 20:39.100]  Because if you buy, I'm just going to give you an example.
[20:39.100 --> 20:43.300]  Maybe you spend a thousand dollars on hypoaspis miles and you put those out there.
[20:43.300 --> 20:44.900]  And I don't know the range that the hypos like.
[20:44.900 --> 20:46.620]  I know that they do like my indoor grow.
[20:46.620 --> 20:48.260]  That's what I buy for the indoor cultivation.
[20:48.260 --> 20:52.660]  If you put the hypoaspis miles out there and it's too hot or too cold, they'll either
[20:52.660 --> 20:54.180]  die or they'll leave.
[20:54.180 --> 20:58.020]  They'll just simply fucking crawl away and go find a more desirable environment.
[20:58.140 --> 20:59.140]  They're just like us.
[20:59.140 --> 21:01.100]  If they don't like what's going on, they're going to go somewhere else.
[21:01.100 --> 21:05.060]  So you've got to get the bugs that are appropriate for your environment.
[21:05.060 --> 21:08.700]  A website that will help you do that, of course, is Arbico Organics.
[21:08.700 --> 21:12.900]  It's A-R-B-I-C-O-organics.com.
[21:12.900 --> 21:18.980]  I cannot give them any positive or negative endorsements on their products nor their customer
[21:18.980 --> 21:19.980]  service.
[21:19.980 --> 21:25.060]  I've seen plenty of positive reviews and I've also seen plenty of negative reviews.
[21:25.100 --> 21:28.460]  I'm right in the middle with the reviews I've read.
[21:28.460 --> 21:30.140]  I would do my own research.
[21:30.140 --> 21:34.460]  When you order bugs, there's got to be a closer insectiary to you to order the bugs from.
[21:34.460 --> 21:37.860]  The advantage of Arbico is they'll sell you very small batches.
[21:37.860 --> 21:41.300]  A lot of other places don't sell small batches of bugs.
[21:41.300 --> 21:43.660]  Arbico will deliver a small batch to you.
[21:43.660 --> 21:47.220]  Again, I can't support or say they're good or bad.
[21:47.220 --> 21:49.460]  I know that they do offer the products we need.
[21:49.460 --> 21:50.980]  I know their catalog is awesome.
[21:50.980 --> 21:52.700]  I know their website is awesome.
[21:52.700 --> 21:54.860]  But I've seen people say that they get dead bugs from them.
[21:54.860 --> 21:58.660]  I've also seen people say that they get amazing bugs from them.
[21:58.660 --> 21:59.700]  Be careful with that.
[21:59.700 --> 22:01.860]  That is going to be your decision to make there.
[22:01.860 --> 22:06.380]  Although their website and their magazines and catalogs are awesome for research, for
[22:06.380 --> 22:08.580]  information, for educational purposes.
[22:08.580 --> 22:11.780]  Even if you don't purchase from them, you can use their website to get you a lot of
[22:11.780 --> 22:15.800]  information, get you a lot of education, get yourself a nice foundation and background.
[22:15.800 --> 22:17.620]  You can read a lot from their website.
[22:17.620 --> 22:23.020]  Again, it's Arbico, A-R-B-I-C-O-organics.com.
[22:23.020 --> 22:26.820]  I believe to the best of my recollection, did not write that down.
[22:26.820 --> 22:31.420]  But one thing that I read is they don't breed any bugs.
[22:31.420 --> 22:35.180]  They buy their bugs from an insectiary and then mail them to you.
[22:35.180 --> 22:36.500]  They're kind of like a third party.
[22:36.500 --> 22:38.660]  They're like the Amazon of bugs.
[22:38.660 --> 22:43.460]  So it may be easier if you can find a local insectiary near you to get the appropriate
[22:43.460 --> 22:44.460]  bugs.
[22:44.460 --> 22:45.860]  That's the way to do it and use Arbico for your research.
[22:45.860 --> 22:49.860]  Again, if you can't find a supplier, that website is always there for you.
[22:49.860 --> 22:51.020]  Do your own research.
[22:51.020 --> 22:53.060]  I'm trying to be really diplomatic about this.
[22:53.060 --> 22:54.620]  I've read good and bad reviews, you guys.
[22:54.620 --> 22:56.460]  I don't know which way I sway.
[22:56.460 --> 23:00.580]  If it's my only option, I may risk it, risk a few bucks to save the garden.
[23:00.580 --> 23:01.580]  Where was I?
[23:01.580 --> 23:02.580]  Do some research.
[23:02.580 --> 23:06.420]  Then once you've established which bugs will live in your area and which bugs are going
[23:06.420 --> 23:10.100]  to battle your area, order the appropriate bugs.
[23:10.100 --> 23:11.860]  I like to set up the subscription service.
[23:11.860 --> 23:17.100]  You can order them, order them to ... You can schedule them to come on specific intervals.
[23:17.100 --> 23:21.340]  When I run a commercial grow, I usually have them show up either every week or every two
[23:21.340 --> 23:24.100]  weeks depending on the threat that is present.
[23:24.100 --> 23:25.420]  If I see bugs, we double up.
[23:25.420 --> 23:30.660]  If I don't see bugs, we go once a week with the sachets and with the releasing of pests.
[23:30.660 --> 23:34.580]  So let me give you a quick list of the predators that I did write down.
[23:34.580 --> 23:37.580]  I don't think I wrote down all of them because I just thought of kookamarus and it's not
[23:37.580 --> 23:38.900]  on the list.
[23:38.900 --> 23:41.360]  The kookamarus, the californicus.
[23:41.360 --> 23:42.540]  Some of these, they changed their names.
[23:42.540 --> 23:45.220]  I may repeat things because they've got double names.
[23:45.340 --> 23:51.940]  The californicus, the kookamarus, the swarsky, hypoaspis miles, lacewings.
[23:51.940 --> 23:52.940]  That's a good start.
[23:52.940 --> 23:57.060]  I think those will work in a lot of environments and they are very aggressive predators.
[23:57.060 --> 23:59.940]  A lot of people like ladybugs.
[23:59.940 --> 24:02.060]  Ladybugs are lazy in my opinion.
[24:02.060 --> 24:03.300]  That is my honest opinion.
[24:03.300 --> 24:05.580]  You can buy a lot of ladybugs and they're not going to do a lot.
[24:05.580 --> 24:11.060]  The ladybug larvae will eat a lot, but the green lacewing in my opinion will eat three
[24:11.060 --> 24:12.060]  times.
[24:12.060 --> 24:13.060]  I don't know the science behind this.
[24:13.060 --> 24:14.060]  I don't know.
[24:14.260 --> 24:19.180]  When I use ladybugs, they end up in the whites and the ducting on the floor, just over there
[24:19.180 --> 24:20.180]  humping each other.
[24:20.180 --> 24:21.260]  You see them fucking all the time.
[24:21.260 --> 24:24.420]  They make really cool pictures, but they don't eat the fucking bugs.
[24:24.420 --> 24:27.540]  When I release green lacewing eggs, I don't see any more bugs.
[24:27.540 --> 24:29.980]  I don't see any lacewings anywhere.
[24:29.980 --> 24:30.980]  They're not over there chilling out.
[24:30.980 --> 24:32.420]  I'm not taking pictures of them.
[24:32.420 --> 24:36.860]  They're being fucking warriors and they're eating all of the bugs I want them to eat.
[24:36.860 --> 24:38.300]  They're really, really fun to watch.
[24:38.300 --> 24:39.300]  They're so ugly.
[24:39.300 --> 24:43.060]  They start off as little crocodiles and they start getting little wings and they just go
[24:43.060 --> 24:45.580]  through this weird metamorphosis.
[24:45.580 --> 24:47.340]  Those are the lacewings.
[24:47.340 --> 24:49.140]  So I am not a bug expert.
[24:49.140 --> 24:53.780]  I'm not an outdoor growing expert, but I do recommend that you research the bugs that
[24:53.780 --> 24:55.900]  will be coming to your area.
[24:55.900 --> 25:00.940]  It's going to be spider mites, thrips, aphids, caterpillars, fungus gnats.
[25:00.940 --> 25:03.420]  Whatever bugs come in your area, I don't know where you are.
[25:03.420 --> 25:04.780]  See, it's hard for me to anticipate.
[25:04.780 --> 25:06.980]  You got to find what's coming to your area.
[25:06.980 --> 25:09.820]  Then think about a cucamorous californis.
[25:09.820 --> 25:11.460]  Is it californicus?
[25:11.460 --> 25:13.900]  You'll figure it out when you search predator.
[25:13.900 --> 25:16.140]  Arbico Organics will have it all right there for you.
[25:16.140 --> 25:17.380]  I don't even need to repeat this.
[25:17.380 --> 25:20.260]  Once you get to Arbico, you're going to see more than what I'm saying.
[25:20.260 --> 25:21.540]  Rove beetles are fucking great.
[25:21.540 --> 25:22.540]  There's a lot of great things.
[25:22.540 --> 25:24.620]  What are the assassin beetles?
[25:24.620 --> 25:27.660]  There are a lot that you can release, but if they're not right for your area, they're
[25:27.660 --> 25:28.900]  not going to have a good time.
[25:28.900 --> 25:29.900]  They're going to leave.
[25:29.900 --> 25:32.820]  Like if you took me to a fish concert, I'm sticking around all day.
[25:32.820 --> 25:36.300]  If you take me to, I would stay to most concerts because I like music.
[25:36.300 --> 25:41.940]  If you took me to a Keith Urban concert, I'd probably leave.
[25:41.940 --> 25:43.620]  Sorry, it's not into the country music.
[25:43.620 --> 25:44.940]  You guys, I'm going to just leave.
[25:44.940 --> 25:48.660]  So that somebody who is a Keith Urban fan can have the ticket and enjoy the show.
[25:48.660 --> 25:50.740]  That's the way it should be.
[25:50.740 --> 25:51.780]  I'm rambling.
[25:51.780 --> 25:53.060]  There's no need to go on with this message.
[25:53.060 --> 25:54.780]  I have answered your question.
[25:54.780 --> 25:57.300]  As for host plants, dude, I don't know.
[25:57.300 --> 25:58.860]  That's my straight up answer for host plants.
[25:58.860 --> 26:01.420]  We would have to contact my buddy Jesse Grows.
[26:01.420 --> 26:02.920]  He is the outdoor grower.
[26:02.920 --> 26:07.800]  If anybody out there has any recommendations for host plants, we can plant outdoors to
[26:07.800 --> 26:09.400]  help mitigate pests.
[26:09.400 --> 26:11.840]  Send your info to growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[26:11.840 --> 26:14.720]  I will read that on a future episode.
[26:14.720 --> 26:18.800]  Also, make sure you follow the bug lady, Susan Wainwright-Evans.
[26:18.800 --> 26:20.120]  Is it Suzanne or Susan?
[26:20.120 --> 26:21.400]  Suzanne Wainwright-Evans.
[26:21.400 --> 26:22.580]  That sounds right.
[26:22.580 --> 26:25.080]  Follow the bug lady on Instagram.
[26:25.080 --> 26:26.920]  She is a pest expert.
[26:26.920 --> 26:28.280]  She's a pesticide expert.
[26:28.280 --> 26:33.440]  I am trained by the Colorado Department of Agriculture, the Colorado State University,
[26:33.440 --> 26:37.680]  also trained by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment in pesticide
[26:37.680 --> 26:39.960]  application, pesticide handling.
[26:39.960 --> 26:41.920]  I am train the trainer certified.
[26:41.920 --> 26:44.640]  I do know quite a bit about pesticides and pesticide application.
[26:44.640 --> 26:48.400]  However, what you're asking is very regionally specific.
[26:48.400 --> 26:53.120]  I would focus in on your region, on the pests attacking your area, the pests, the prevention
[26:53.120 --> 26:55.880]  that would work in your area, and then go a little bit from there.
[26:55.880 --> 26:57.960]  I hope I put you off on the right foot.
[26:57.960 --> 27:00.520]  Got you onto the right start.
[27:00.520 --> 27:02.160]  Leaned you toward the right website.
[27:02.160 --> 27:03.720]  Hope I got you going in the right direction.
[27:03.720 --> 27:07.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[27:07.840 --> 27:12.520]  cutters, pollen chuckers, organic growers, salt spillers, I want to thank each and every
[27:12.520 --> 27:16.040]  one of you for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[27:16.040 --> 27:17.080]  My voice is burning out.
[27:17.080 --> 27:19.360]  I think I've covered enough ground on this episode.
[27:19.360 --> 27:22.200]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[27:22.200 --> 27:25.240]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, I'd love to hear from you.

[27:28.520 --> 27:32.360]  If you feel like the episode was educational, informative, entertaining, maybe you just
[27:32.360 --> 27:35.240]  want to throw me a couple of bucks because you like what I'm doing, all you have to do
[27:35.240 --> 27:38.920]  is visit patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.

[27:58.840 --> 28:00.840]  Everything else, check out the website, iRegenetics.com.
[28:00.840 --> 28:03.000]  That's all I've got for you.
[28:03.000 --> 28:04.280]  My throat is done.
[28:04.280 --> 28:05.440]  I'll be back.
[28:05.440 --> 28:09.000]  One of the upcoming episodes, probably not the next one, but maybe the one right after
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.600]  that, I do intend to do a groovy gravy recap episode.
[28:12.600 --> 28:15.520]  I'll let you guys know how that event went, so stay tuned.
[28:15.520 --> 28:17.240]  That is all I've got for you for this episode.
[28:17.240 --> 28:19.520]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[28:19.520 --> 28:23.160]  Let's give a big shout out to my friend Tree Starmeadow.
[28:23.160 --> 28:27.760]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
