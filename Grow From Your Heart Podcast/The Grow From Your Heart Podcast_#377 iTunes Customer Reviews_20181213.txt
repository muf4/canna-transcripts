[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[00:01.720 --> 00:05.380]  It's time for episode 377 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.380 --> 00:08.260]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:08.260 --> 00:13.160]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:13.160 --> 00:17.280]  you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:17.280 --> 00:21.040]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm dabbing on today.
[00:21.040 --> 00:25.160]  I've got a nice little buffet of Viola Labs concentrates in front of me.
[00:25.160 --> 00:28.560]  Let's start off with this SFV OG Chem de la Chem.
[00:28.560 --> 00:33.600]  I really like this because of the diesel-y, dirty, funky, fuel-y smell.
[00:33.600 --> 00:35.480]  I'm giving it a smell right now.
[00:35.480 --> 00:40.080]  It's got a hint of diesel fuel to it, and then that SFV OG in there gives it that kind
[00:40.080 --> 00:44.800]  of fuel-y, feed-y kind of thing, and I really like that aroma a lot.
[00:44.800 --> 00:47.380]  The next on the list is the TKLA.
[00:47.380 --> 00:48.480]  This one smells great.
[00:48.480 --> 00:50.840]  I'm cracking it open right now to give it a smell.
[00:50.840 --> 00:52.140]  It's got that earthiness to it.
[00:52.140 --> 00:54.040]  It's got a little bit of a gassiness to it.
[00:54.040 --> 00:59.240]  Not as extreme on the diesel terp as the SFV, but it certainly does have a fuel-y,
[00:59.240 --> 01:03.440]  earthy sort of aroma to it, and the TKLA packs quite a punch.
[01:03.440 --> 01:07.240]  This one kind of put me to sleep last night, so I'm loving the TKLA.
[01:07.240 --> 01:11.080]  And then if we're going to go by flavor, this next one would be my favorite in terms of
[01:11.080 --> 01:12.080]  flavor.
[01:12.080 --> 01:13.920]  This is the Tropicana Cookies.
[01:13.920 --> 01:20.720]  This one, as soon as you crack it open, I get a hint of grapefruits, followed by a little
[01:20.720 --> 01:24.880]  bit of maybe bubbly champagne, or maybe a hint of pineapples, now that I'm smelling
[01:24.880 --> 01:26.560]  it up real close.
[01:26.560 --> 01:29.040]  There's a hint of pineapples and grapefruits in here.
[01:29.040 --> 01:33.940]  And as it lingers on my nose, I smell sort of a sweet candy, maybe a sweet tart sort
[01:33.940 --> 01:34.940]  of a thing.
[01:34.940 --> 01:39.500]  So I've got a nice variety of concentrates from our friends at Viola Labs today.
[01:39.500 --> 01:41.440]  It's hard to pick a favorite out of all three of these.
[01:41.440 --> 01:48.040]  I like that SFV, OG, Chemdela, Chem blend because of that gassy, diesel-y sort of aroma,
[01:48.040 --> 01:49.920]  and that aftertaste that it leaves.
[01:50.120 --> 01:54.280]  I really love the Tropicana Cookies because of that sweet grapefruit pineapple kind of
[01:54.280 --> 01:57.440]  flavor, and then it just leaves a candy-coated layer on your tongue.
[01:57.440 --> 02:02.400]  But that TKLA, it lacked in flavor, but it really punched me with the potency.
[02:02.400 --> 02:04.000]  So they are all three winners in my book.
[02:04.000 --> 02:05.000]  Big shout out to Viola Labs.
[02:05.000 --> 02:06.920]  They've been doing a great job lately.
[02:06.920 --> 02:09.960]  And I'm staring at this package on my table, and I just realized that no matter which way
[02:09.960 --> 02:14.120]  I turn this, this says Viola upside down or right side up.
[02:14.120 --> 02:15.960]  So great job with the creative logo there.
[02:15.960 --> 02:18.440]  I'm honestly not sure if it's Viola or Viola.
[02:18.440 --> 02:23.400]  I was recently told that it was named after one of the people's grandmother.
[02:23.400 --> 02:28.280]  I would like to get your name correctly, but everywhere I go, if I say Viola in a dispensary,
[02:28.280 --> 02:29.900]  they correct me and say it's Viola.
[02:29.900 --> 02:33.040]  If I start by saying Viola, they correct me and say it's Viola.
[02:33.040 --> 02:34.680]  So I'm always wrong.
[02:34.680 --> 02:36.040]  So I don't know the proper way to say it.
[02:36.040 --> 02:37.040]  But big shout out to your company.
[02:37.040 --> 02:38.800]  You're doing a great job with the concentrates.
[02:38.800 --> 02:39.800]  I do approve.
[02:39.800 --> 02:40.800]  I will be back for more.
[02:40.800 --> 02:43.960]  While I'm talking about this great concentrate, I should mention where I picked it up.
[02:43.960 --> 02:48.520]  I grabbed this at the Colorado Cannabis Exchange at the south end of Pueblo.
[02:48.520 --> 02:52.160]  Big shout out to my friends at the Colorado Cannabis Exchange for always taking super
[02:52.160 --> 02:53.160]  good care of me.
[02:53.160 --> 02:54.560]  You guys, they do not pay me to say that.
[02:54.560 --> 02:55.560]  They do not sponsor me.
[02:55.560 --> 02:56.840]  They do not endorse me.
[02:56.840 --> 02:58.060]  They're just super great to me.
[02:58.060 --> 03:00.000]  Every time I go in there, they treat me with kindness.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.720]  They're super patient, and they always know what to recommend for me.
[03:02.720 --> 03:04.080]  So I appreciate that.
[03:04.080 --> 03:05.080]  Thank you guys.
[03:05.080 --> 03:07.220]  Big shout out and a big fist bump to the whole crew.
[03:07.220 --> 03:10.520]  And the one that got me super talkative out of that mess was the Tropicana cookies.
[03:10.520 --> 03:13.140]  The other two were kind of more on the mellow side.
[03:13.140 --> 03:16.600]  That Tropicana cookies lifted my head up and made me super talkative again.
[03:16.600 --> 03:18.840]  So let's get into a podcast, you guys.
[03:18.840 --> 03:20.380]  This will not be a long episode.
[03:20.380 --> 03:22.600]  This is going to be a Thursday episode.
[03:22.600 --> 03:25.240]  I have been spoiling you guys with two episodes every week.
[03:25.240 --> 03:28.760]  I don't want to cut back on episodes, but I'm going to do a couple of short Thursday
[03:28.760 --> 03:31.600]  episodes for a couple of weeks while I get a few things handled.
[03:31.600 --> 03:32.600]  I am just busy.
[03:32.600 --> 03:33.600]  I'm overwhelmed.
[03:33.600 --> 03:37.740]  I don't want to stop doing podcasting at all, but the Thursday shows may get a little shorter.
[03:37.740 --> 03:40.120]  The Monday shows will stay long and tense.
[03:40.720 --> 03:43.760]  There'll be in-depth grow lessons, but for Thursdays, we may goof off for a couple of
[03:43.760 --> 03:44.760]  weeks.
[03:44.760 --> 03:46.280]  Let's have some fun in this episode.
[03:46.280 --> 03:50.240]  Let's read some current iTunes customer ratings and reviews.
[03:50.240 --> 03:54.600]  If you'd like to leave an iTunes customer review, I would appreciate your review and
[03:54.600 --> 03:57.040]  I will read it on a future episode.
[03:57.040 --> 03:58.480]  To leave a review, it's really easy.
[03:58.480 --> 04:02.640]  If you're listening on your iPhone, go to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[04:02.640 --> 04:05.560]  Go to the most current episodes and scroll up.
[04:05.560 --> 04:09.000]  As you scroll up, the opportunity to write a review will pop up.
[04:09.160 --> 04:10.840]  Click on there, write a review.
[04:10.840 --> 04:14.000]  When you click on write a review, the first thing it does is give you the opportunity
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.440]  to click an amount of stars.
[04:16.440 --> 04:18.800]  Click on the amount of stars you feel I deserve.
[04:18.800 --> 04:19.800]  Be honest.
[04:19.800 --> 04:22.400]  So far, most folks have left five star reviews.
[04:22.400 --> 04:24.000]  I've gotten one one-star review.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.800]  We read that on the show earlier, and today we've got a three-star review.
[04:27.800 --> 04:29.520]  We will get into that one.
[04:29.520 --> 04:33.560]  But please leave the amount of stars you feel I deserve and type in an honest review and
[04:33.560 --> 04:36.740]  I will read your review on a future episode.
[04:36.740 --> 04:40.820]  If you're listening to the podcast on a computer and you're using iTunes and you'd like to
[04:40.820 --> 04:44.580]  leave a customer review, go to the podcast tab in iTunes.
[04:44.580 --> 04:48.160]  It says music and movies and TV shows and podcasts.
[04:48.160 --> 04:50.000]  Click on where it says podcasts.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.900]  Then once you get to the podcast screen, you need to click on the store.
[04:52.900 --> 04:55.180]  That's where you search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[04:55.180 --> 04:57.060]  The search bar is on the right.
[04:57.060 --> 04:59.420]  Then you click on the podcast tab.
[04:59.420 --> 05:03.940]  Once you are on the podcast page, the ratings and reviews tab will be very easy to find.
[05:03.940 --> 05:05.820]  It is right next to the show logo.
[05:05.820 --> 05:06.900]  Click right there.
[05:06.900 --> 05:08.460]  Ratings and reviews will pop up.
[05:08.460 --> 05:11.780]  That's where you are able to leave the amount of stars you feel are appropriate and you
[05:11.780 --> 05:14.220]  will be able to type in your review.
[05:14.220 --> 05:19.820]  Now let's get into some of the most recent iTunes customer reviews.
[05:19.820 --> 05:25.580]  Our first iTunes customer review is left by people that call themselves Stone Blue.
[05:25.580 --> 05:27.580]  The headline says informative and fun.
[05:27.580 --> 05:29.760]  They left us a five-star rating.
[05:29.760 --> 05:33.420]  It says, thank you, Rasta Jeff, for your informative and fun podcast.
[05:33.420 --> 05:37.920]  My wife and I have made it sort of a ritual to listen to your podcast while we're tending
[05:37.920 --> 05:39.440]  our garden.
[05:39.440 --> 05:43.100]  Time in the garden together has strengthened our relationship and we're happy to have you
[05:43.100 --> 05:44.720]  as a part of it.
[05:44.720 --> 05:49.500]  She usually doesn't like to listen to podcasts, but after a few episodes, she warmed up to
[05:49.500 --> 05:51.020]  it quickly.
[05:51.020 --> 05:55.540]  As growers ourselves, we encourage our friends to start their own garden and we recently
[05:55.540 --> 05:57.780]  turned them on to your grow lessons.
[05:57.780 --> 06:02.060]  A few have taken our suggestion and it's easier than going to their house and walking them
[06:02.220 --> 06:03.220]  through everything.
[06:03.220 --> 06:07.420]  So thank you, Timothy Green Thumbs and Dreadhead Martha.
[06:07.420 --> 06:12.620]  Hey, Timothy Green Thumbs and Dreadhead Martha, it is an honor to be in your grow with you.
[06:12.620 --> 06:17.620]  It's an honor to be contributing to your relationship and helping you to build a bond together while
[06:17.620 --> 06:19.420]  building a bond with your plants.
[06:19.420 --> 06:21.140]  That's an awesome iTunes review.
[06:21.140 --> 06:22.780]  I truly appreciate that.
[06:22.780 --> 06:25.720]  I also appreciate that you were sharing the show with other people.
[06:25.720 --> 06:26.720]  That means a lot to me.
[06:26.720 --> 06:28.620]  A great way for the show to grow is by word of mouth.
[06:28.620 --> 06:30.460]  So you were doing a great job.
[06:30.460 --> 06:31.460]  Thank you.
[06:31.460 --> 06:32.460]  I appreciate the review.
[06:32.460 --> 06:35.140]  Thanks for the great support and thank you for sharing the show.
[06:35.140 --> 06:38.300]  And it's kind of funny that you say it's easier than going to their house because that's part
[06:38.300 --> 06:40.180]  of what started me recording a show.
[06:40.180 --> 06:43.980]  I got tired of telling the same speech over and over on how to do stuff.
[06:43.980 --> 06:45.980]  So I just started recording it and posting it.
[06:45.980 --> 06:49.500]  And when people ask me the same question, I can say, hey, just go listen to episode
[06:49.500 --> 06:51.540]  315 and you can learn about mother plants.
[06:51.540 --> 06:55.380]  So I'm glad that you got the same idea and you were sharing the show so that people can
[06:55.380 --> 06:56.380]  learn.
[06:56.380 --> 07:00.700]  Hey, Timothy Green Thumbs and Dreadhead Martha, I look forward to catching you at a show this
[07:00.700 --> 07:01.700]  summer.
[07:01.700 --> 07:05.260]  Thanks again for the great iTunes customer review.
[07:05.260 --> 07:08.620]  Our next customer review comes from somebody we have heard from before.
[07:08.620 --> 07:11.000]  This person calls themselves Yolo Grower.
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.300]  They left us a three star review.
[07:13.300 --> 07:18.620]  The title of their review is White Mike and their iTunes customer review goes like this.
[07:18.620 --> 07:22.640]  I think 99% of your listeners are here for grow information.
[07:22.640 --> 07:26.260]  It would be great if you stop bringing white Mike on the show so we don't have to listen
[07:26.260 --> 07:27.940]  to politics.
[07:27.940 --> 07:30.540]  Cannabis related or not, it's still politics.
[07:30.580 --> 07:34.140]  I don't think you have to convince your listeners to be pro cannabis.
[07:34.140 --> 07:37.420]  We obviously all are pro cannabis.
[07:37.420 --> 07:40.820]  Well first off, let me thank you for the customer review and thank you for listening.
[07:40.820 --> 07:44.580]  You're obviously listening to quite a few episodes if you were catching the Mike episodes.
[07:44.580 --> 07:45.820]  So I'm grateful that you're here.
[07:45.820 --> 07:47.460]  I'm grateful that you're a part of the crew.
[07:47.460 --> 07:50.780]  I'm grateful that you are enjoying most of the show.
[07:50.780 --> 07:55.460]  As for not liking the episodes with Mike, the podcast is free and you can always skip
[07:55.460 --> 07:56.540]  the episode.
[07:56.540 --> 08:01.300]  I can recommend the Dude Grow Show, the Adam Dunn Show, or you can always try to listen
[08:01.300 --> 08:06.740]  to Cannabis Cultivation and Science with Tad Hussey if you need more grow knowledge while
[08:06.740 --> 08:08.860]  I'm not doing a grow lesson.
[08:08.860 --> 08:14.100]  Also let me point out that the point of the show is cannabis news, education and conversation.
[08:14.100 --> 08:17.800]  And just because we're not talking about growing cannabis doesn't mean that you're not going
[08:17.800 --> 08:20.600]  to learn something, that there's not something valuable.
[08:20.600 --> 08:24.820]  Also just because there's not something valuable for you in that lesson doesn't mean that a
[08:24.820 --> 08:26.820]  lot of people are enjoying it.
[08:26.820 --> 08:30.860]  So however much I do appreciate your review, I'm not going to change anything.
[08:30.860 --> 08:32.300]  Mike is one of my best friends.
[08:32.300 --> 08:33.780]  Mike is a valuable resource.
[08:33.780 --> 08:38.000]  And to be quite honest with you, several people request more episodes with Mike.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.340]  So look forward to hearing from Mike on the show.
[08:40.340 --> 08:41.540]  This is an out loud invitation.
[08:41.540 --> 08:45.460]  Hey Mike, whenever you want to come on my show brother, you are always fucking welcome.
[08:45.460 --> 08:47.740]  That seat across from me, that is yours bro.
[08:47.740 --> 08:48.820]  Come be on the podcast.
[08:48.820 --> 08:52.360]  Mike number two is for you whenever you are free.
[08:52.360 --> 08:55.780]  So Yolo grower, unfortunately this isn't going to work out for you.
[08:55.780 --> 08:57.760]  I'm going to have Mike on the podcast more.
[08:57.760 --> 08:59.480]  I feel like he is a valuable resource.
[08:59.480 --> 09:03.360]  I feel like educating and informing our community is an important thing.
[09:03.360 --> 09:07.660]  I feel like I've got a large audience and part of my responsibility is to educate and
[09:07.660 --> 09:08.720]  invoke people.
[09:08.720 --> 09:09.840]  I want people to vote.
[09:09.840 --> 09:11.640]  I want people to support cannabis.
[09:11.640 --> 09:14.120]  You say that obviously all of us are pro cannabis.
[09:14.120 --> 09:15.120]  Maybe not.
[09:15.120 --> 09:19.760]  I encourage people to listen to my show with people who are not cannabis friendly so that
[09:19.760 --> 09:23.480]  we can possibly sway them to be cannabis friendly.
[09:23.480 --> 09:24.720]  So I'm sorry you don't like, you know what?
[09:24.720 --> 09:25.720]  I'm not even sorry.
[09:25.720 --> 09:27.360]  It's too bad you don't like some of the episodes.
[09:27.360 --> 09:30.620]  I wish you would have more of an open mind and you would learn to enjoy those episodes
[09:30.620 --> 09:34.460]  with Mike because honestly there is some gold hidden in those episodes.
[09:34.460 --> 09:36.960]  If you are skipping them, you're missing some good shit.
[09:36.960 --> 09:39.400]  Sorry you couldn't hang out with us for the good times.
[09:39.400 --> 09:41.280]  Yolo grower, I hope everything goes well for you.
[09:41.280 --> 09:43.920]  I hope you still listen to the episodes without Mike.
[09:43.920 --> 09:45.400]  I look forward to your next review.
[09:45.400 --> 09:47.880]  I'm sure I'm going to hear from you sometime soon.
[09:47.880 --> 09:49.000]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[09:49.000 --> 09:50.520]  You will never slow me down.
[09:50.520 --> 09:54.560]  All right, let's move on to the next iTunes customer review.
[09:54.560 --> 09:58.120]  This next review comes from somebody who calls themselves Supashah.
[09:58.120 --> 10:00.560]  They left us a five star rating.
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.940]  The headline says, this podcast is for you and the review goes a lot like this.
[10:05.940 --> 10:10.180]  If you are anything like myself and have a desire to learn how to grow, this show is
[10:10.180 --> 10:12.760]  one of the best ways, period.
[10:12.760 --> 10:17.200]  From the basics all the way to his latest grow lessons, Jeff's knowledge and passion
[10:17.240 --> 10:19.680]  resonate through the podcast.
[10:19.680 --> 10:22.840]  Hey Supashah, thank you for the great review.
[10:22.840 --> 10:26.160]  I'm glad you're listening to the grow lessons and I'm glad that they're helping you out
[10:26.160 --> 10:27.660]  and I'm glad that you see my passion.
[10:27.660 --> 10:29.520]  I've got a lot of love for the cannabis plant.
[10:29.520 --> 10:34.160]  I've got a lot of love for people and I want people to grow the best cannabis they possibly
[10:34.160 --> 10:35.160]  can.
[10:35.160 --> 10:39.000]  I think a podcast is one of the best ways to effectively teach people how to grow because
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.840]  knowledge changes every day in the cannabis world.
[10:41.840 --> 10:43.000]  So I can do updates.
[10:43.000 --> 10:44.280]  I can teach you what I've learned.
[10:44.280 --> 10:46.880]  I can share my knowledge without having to write a book.
[10:46.920 --> 10:50.440]  I feel like by the time you finish writing a book, you run it through all the processes,
[10:50.440 --> 10:51.960]  the publishers, the editors.
[10:51.960 --> 10:55.240]  By the time that book comes out, it's pretty much outdated and all of your knowledge needs
[10:55.240 --> 10:56.440]  to be rewritten.
[10:56.440 --> 10:59.560]  With a podcast, I can record an episode the day I learn something.
[10:59.560 --> 11:02.760]  I can get it out and get all that fresh content right to you.
[11:02.760 --> 11:06.320]  So thank you for enjoying the podcast and thank you for learning with me.
[11:06.320 --> 11:09.700]  I never enjoyed school, but I always enjoyed learning new things.
[11:09.700 --> 11:13.680]  So having a different way of learning things was always great to me and finding podcasts
[11:13.680 --> 11:17.520]  and different avenues of absorbing knowledge without sitting in a classroom and listening
[11:17.520 --> 11:20.360]  to some teacher drone on about crap I didn't care about.
[11:20.360 --> 11:23.960]  I feel like learning through podcasts and things like that were a great option and an
[11:23.960 --> 11:28.400]  opportunity for a person with a brain like mine who is always inquisitive, but doesn't
[11:28.400 --> 11:33.360]  have any desire to sit in a classroom and be still and listen to a lecture.
[11:33.360 --> 11:37.480]  And I think that also makes me understand how to teach people in a different way.
[11:37.480 --> 11:40.640]  I don't teach in a traditional way because I don't learn in a traditional way.
[11:40.640 --> 11:45.780]  So since I've got some weird ADD or boredom or whatever, I feel like I can keep people's
[11:45.780 --> 11:49.000]  attention who also suffer from the ADD or the boredom.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.720]  I can get you learning, I can suck you in and you don't get bored listening to the grow
[11:52.720 --> 11:55.160]  lessons and then you're able to absorb the knowledge.
[11:55.160 --> 11:58.440]  You'll laugh a few times and at the end it doesn't feel like you were just beat up by
[11:58.440 --> 12:00.280]  some lecturer.
[12:00.280 --> 12:05.920]  So SuperShaw, after a long ramble, thank you for a great iTunes review and also thank you
[12:05.920 --> 12:10.560]  for noticing my passion for cannabis and also my passion for teaching.
[12:10.600 --> 12:13.440]  I feel like it's partly my duty to teach people about cannabis.
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.160]  I was blessed to absorb a lot of knowledge about the cannabis plant very quickly at a
[12:18.160 --> 12:19.200]  young age.
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.360]  I was also very blessed to be involved in the cannabis industry as it bloomed around
[12:23.360 --> 12:24.360]  me.
[12:24.360 --> 12:29.320]  I feel like it is my job and part of my karma to go and teach as much as I can about this
[12:29.320 --> 12:33.760]  plant and to shine as much positive light on this plant as I can.
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.440]  So it does mean a lot to me when people notice my passion and my desire to teach and my drive
[12:38.440 --> 12:39.440]  behind this plant.
[12:39.960 --> 12:41.600]  So extra thanks for noticing that, dude.
[12:41.600 --> 12:42.600]  That means a lot to me.
[12:42.600 --> 12:49.000]  All right, let's move on to our final iTunes customer review for this episode.
[12:49.000 --> 13:00.600]  This last review comes from a person who calls themselves 789-454-879823123.
[13:00.600 --> 13:02.160]  That's a very specific name.
[13:02.160 --> 13:04.360]  They left this review on December 10th.
[13:04.360 --> 13:10.520]  They left me a five-star review and the title of their review is Full Melt Six Star Podcast.
[13:10.520 --> 13:15.200]  That is a hash joke and I do approve their saying that this podcast is full melt.
[13:15.200 --> 13:19.280]  We will leave no funky residuals on the nail and everything will burn clear and it will
[13:19.280 --> 13:20.440]  taste great.
[13:20.440 --> 13:24.520]  This is six star full melt podcasting right here, dude.
[13:24.520 --> 13:25.520]  That's a great review.
[13:25.520 --> 13:26.600]  I appreciate that.
[13:26.600 --> 13:27.600]  That's just the headline.
[13:27.600 --> 13:30.700]  The review goes on to say, I love dabs.
[13:30.700 --> 13:34.980]  Very irrelevant to the show, but since you said full melt six star podcast, I can't be
[13:34.980 --> 13:36.300]  mad at you about anything.
[13:36.300 --> 13:38.660]  I love dabs and you approve of the show.
[13:38.660 --> 13:39.660]  We are friends.
[13:39.660 --> 13:50.380]  Big shout out and thanks for the five star customer review from our new friend 789-454-879823123.
[13:50.380 --> 13:52.420]  Bro how did you come up with that name?
[13:52.420 --> 13:53.420]  That's creative.
[13:53.420 --> 13:54.420]  Thank you for the great review.
[13:54.420 --> 13:57.540]  Everybody, thank you for the great iTunes customer reviews.
[13:57.540 --> 14:00.460]  I do appreciate all of the support, all of the ratings.

[14:04.180 --> 14:05.660]  you do listen.
[14:05.660 --> 14:09.860]  And once again, I would appreciate it if you leave a customer review on iTunes.
[14:09.860 --> 14:13.180]  All right, podcast world, I told you at the top of the show that this was going to be
[14:13.180 --> 14:14.180]  a short episode.
[14:14.180 --> 14:16.380]  It is time for me to start wrapping up the podcast.
[14:16.380 --> 14:18.860]  I want to give a couple of quick Patreon shout outs.
[14:18.860 --> 14:22.980]  I need to give a huge shout out to Keith K and also a big giant shout out to Basilis
[14:22.980 --> 14:25.460]  G. Thank you for all the Patreon support.
