[01:29.640 --> 01:31.360]  Thank you guys for watching
[01:31.360 --> 01:37.560]  Let's start off with the great update a couple of episodes back. I shared a photo of our friend Xavier's plant
[01:38.000 --> 01:43.660]  Xavier's plants were struggling. They needed some help. We gave them some advice on the show and guess what?
[01:43.660 --> 01:46.740]  I've gotten an update and the plants look beautiful
[01:46.740 --> 01:51.260]  I'll drop in a picture probably right about here and I'll show you what the plants look like now
[01:51.380 --> 01:55.300]  Good job to my friend Xavier you pulled through you fixed them. You didn't panic
[01:55.300 --> 02:01.980]  He followed instructions and the plants look beautiful. Shout out my dude. Good job. Where are we gonna go from there?
[02:01.980 --> 02:07.300]  Oh that reminds me on the I read genetics website. There is a grow help tab
[02:07.300 --> 02:12.500]  That's what I'm trying to say a grow help tab on the I read genetics website. Go to I read genetics calm
[02:12.500 --> 02:15.940]  You will find a tab that says grow help if you click on that tab
[02:15.940 --> 02:21.860]  We ask you about 16 basic questions. We ask what you're growing. What strain are you indoors or outdoors?
[02:21.980 --> 02:23.900]  What type of lighting are you using?
[02:23.900 --> 02:27.980]  Just a few basic questions to give me an idea of how to better answer your question
[02:27.980 --> 02:31.020]  Then we allow you to ask a detailed question
[02:31.220 --> 02:38.340]  We have recently added a photo section to that grow help tab big shout out to my web guy. Thank you, bro
[02:38.340 --> 02:42.320]  I do appreciate that. I asked for it on the podcast. I got an email earlier today
[02:42.560 --> 02:46.160]  Said hey, check this out. There was a photo in a grow question
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.640]  I do appreciate that that will help you guys that will help me that will help me help you
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.660]  So big shout out and thanks to my web guy for all the support dude. You are faster impressive
[02:55.660 --> 02:56.840]  I owe you a big one
[02:56.840 --> 03:03.000]  Also you guys now when you go to the grow help tab you can attach your grow photos that will help me diagnose your problems
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.280]  Quite a bit and be forewarned. There's a good chance. I'll display your photo right about here on the podcast
[03:09.280 --> 03:12.960]  Where do we go from that part of the show? I've got a lot of great emails
[03:12.960 --> 03:16.840]  I don't know if I need to waste too much time rambling about a bunch of stuff today
[03:17.200 --> 03:21.840]  Let's jump right into these grow questions here. I feel like I covered the notes in the business part of the show
[03:21.840 --> 03:27.000]  I've got a question that came from patreon. This one comes from our friend Papa Z
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.720]  It says what up Rasta Jeff Papa Z here several weeks ago
[03:30.720 --> 03:35.360]  I sent an email for a seed tester application as did a lot of people
[03:35.720 --> 03:40.760]  Asking for people who wanted to be testers of my seeds and my new creations of my genetics
[03:40.760 --> 03:43.540]  I got a lot of tester applications
[03:43.680 --> 03:50.200]  This says I never heard anything back. But my question is this before I even get to the question. I got an
[03:50.760 --> 03:55.400]  Overwhelming amount of tester applications. I'm still finding them. I'm still going through them
[03:55.400 --> 04:00.600]  They are now moved to a folder that says tester applications. I've sent out quite a few tester seeds
[04:00.600 --> 04:04.360]  I'm still going through them if you haven't gotten testers if you haven't gotten a response
[04:05.040 --> 04:09.960]  Don't take it personally don't take it as a rejection. I'm always going to be making new things
[04:09.960 --> 04:14.680]  I'm always going to need testers at different levels for different projects. So don't be shy
[04:15.120 --> 04:19.280]  Don't feel like you've gotten turned down. You still may get selected out of that tester pool
[04:19.480 --> 04:23.920]  We're always hiring is kind of the attitude here. Anyway, let me jump into the question
[04:23.920 --> 04:25.640]  It says what could I do to?
[04:25.640 --> 04:30.680]  What could I do differently to make me a better candidate for you to choose me to test for you?
[04:30.680 --> 04:36.440]  I believe in always growing with the intent of each run being better than the last so I would like to know what areas I'm
[04:36.440 --> 04:42.040]  Lacking in is I want to be the best grower possible and I love your gear much love and once again
[04:42.040 --> 04:46.040]  Thanks for everything you do for all of us growers trying to become better
[04:46.680 --> 04:48.040]  I
[04:48.040 --> 04:52.780]  Can't say anything specifically that you can do to be a better candidate as a tester
[04:52.780 --> 04:58.180]  I need all different kinds of testers. I need I need testers of all skill levels
[04:58.180 --> 05:01.460]  I need some people that are better as photographers than growers
[05:01.460 --> 05:06.360]  I need some people that are real analytical and send me over detailed reports on what they fed them
[05:06.380 --> 05:09.960]  Some people just send me a picture every week and that's basically what I get
[05:10.020 --> 05:15.260]  Some people send me a report on what they fed it what they did to it. I get a lot of varying reports
[05:15.260 --> 05:18.780]  I expect a few different things, but I know that humans are going to do things their way
[05:19.180 --> 05:22.700]  So by giving my seeds out to a bunch of people who do things their way
[05:22.700 --> 05:25.340]  I get a lot of great feedback people find their niche
[05:25.660 --> 05:30.220]  Their way their spot how to be a tester for me and they just do what they do the best
[05:30.220 --> 05:35.820]  So to be a good tester, I would say do what you do the best. I need someone that can communicate
[05:35.820 --> 05:40.100]  That's one of the things I really look forward to I send out a lot of seeds and I've said it before
[05:40.660 --> 05:47.780]  About three out of every ten back packs of tester seeds. I said the testers just lose communication
[05:48.260 --> 05:53.180]  Eventually, maybe they get the seeds. They don't even reply once they've got them. Maybe they say hey, thanks for the seeds
[05:53.180 --> 05:56.900]  And that's all I get from them or they send me a couple of weeks of reports and then they fade off
[05:56.900 --> 05:58.900]  But my point is
[05:59.020 --> 06:03.820]  Sometimes I send out testers. I don't even get communication. So be able to communicate with me take some photos
[06:03.820 --> 06:08.500]  Let me know what's going on. That's basically what I asked for for my testers for you specifically
[06:08.500 --> 06:11.660]  I don't have anything that I could tell you to make you a better tester
[06:11.660 --> 06:17.500]  However, I did respond to you and I did let you know that being a patreon contributor shows me that you've been around for a while
[06:18.260 --> 06:21.380]  Having longevity having been around the group definitely helps you out
[06:21.380 --> 06:24.100]  There may be a little bit of favoritism being played in that sort of thing
[06:24.100 --> 06:26.500]  But if I've seen your name a lot, I've seen your photos
[06:26.500 --> 06:32.140]  I know your long-term IRI army that does help but new people are welcome. Don't think I'm just sticking to the old folks
[06:32.140 --> 06:37.960]  I find some great testers and these new random friends were making however, I don't have any specific advice for you
[06:37.960 --> 06:40.700]  But do message me back. I did send you a message on patreon
[06:40.780 --> 06:43.740]  We'll talk more about getting you some test seeds since you have been a longtime
[06:44.420 --> 06:47.780]  Patreon supporter again you guys if I have not read your
[06:48.100 --> 06:53.060]  Tester application if I haven't not agreed to send you seeds still don't be discouraged. Don't be shy
[06:53.580 --> 06:57.420]  Listen to that tester episode if you haven't listened to it and you're still interested in being a tester
[06:57.580 --> 07:00.300]  Still keep sending in the tester apps. I will get to them
[07:00.580 --> 07:04.140]  I'm just going through looking at pictures choosing what I need for now
[07:04.140 --> 07:06.260]  I don't always need the exact same thing
[07:06.260 --> 07:11.500]  Like I said, sometimes I need the guys with the super detailed and gals with the super detailed
[07:12.140 --> 07:17.180]  Dirt notes I get a lot of notes from one person about what's in their soil. They're running organic living soil
[07:17.180 --> 07:22.400]  I get to know everything about that. I haven't gotten any details on the plants, but I know what's in the dirt every week
[07:22.400 --> 07:23.940]  Some people tell me
[07:23.940 --> 07:27.540]  Every micro mole of light that is happening to the plants
[07:27.540 --> 07:31.060]  I get just a lot of varying different things and that gives me a lot of data
[07:31.060 --> 07:36.820]  So every scientist is going to do their own experiment that kind of still falls in my guidelines my expectations
[07:36.820 --> 07:38.380]  And it works out for me very well
[07:38.380 --> 07:42.940]  So be the best grower you could be be able to have repeatable processes
[07:42.940 --> 07:48.060]  That's the sort of stuff I look for if you're not just doing crazy random experiments with every batch
[07:48.060 --> 07:53.140]  I'd like to see some sort of continuity some sort of process a standard operating procedure would be ideal
[07:53.860 --> 07:57.940]  And the ability to communicate and speak well and talk to me. Well is great
[07:57.940 --> 08:02.060]  So you seem to have those skills so we will be in touch big shout out to my friend Papa Z
[08:02.060 --> 08:06.160]  You guys don't feel like you're getting blown off if I have not answered your tester
[08:06.600 --> 08:11.000]  Application email there were a lot of them. I get a lot of emails. There's only one of me
[08:11.080 --> 08:16.640]  Please do remember there are a lot of you. I've got close to 6,000 subscribers here on YouTube. I've got
[08:18.360 --> 08:20.360]  53,000 followers on cannabis
[08:20.600 --> 08:23.240]  30 something thousand on Instagram I
[08:24.160 --> 08:29.160]  Stay busy plus the seed companies and everybody else. I interact with I have a lot of emails. I'm not making excuses
[08:29.160 --> 08:35.580]  I love it. Don't ever stop. I think I work best when I've got some pressure on me. No diamonds. No pressure
[08:35.580 --> 08:40.820]  No diamonds, is that what they say if I have time to chill I fucking chill. That's no good. All right
[08:40.820 --> 08:41.820]  I'm gonna get refocused
[08:41.820 --> 08:48.980]  We're gonna keep reading messages here on the podcast because this is a great a message this one comes from our friend Alabama, man
[08:48.980 --> 08:53.540]  What's up, dude? I see your name on the patreon quite a bit. Thank you for the continued patreon support
[08:53.540 --> 08:58.420]  I sure do appreciate it big love big respect big fist bump. Let's get right into this one
[08:58.420 --> 09:00.820]  It says here's a couple of questions for future shows
[09:01.340 --> 09:03.220]  Concerning IRI genetics
[09:03.220 --> 09:05.740]  Just in case you don't know some people may not even be aware
[09:05.740 --> 09:09.780]  Not only am I a podcaster here to help you learn how to grow. I'm also a seed breeder
[09:09.780 --> 09:15.020]  I'm the sole proprietor sole breeder for IRI genetics premium seeds. That's right. I make seeds
[09:15.540 --> 09:17.340]  regular feminized seeds
[09:17.340 --> 09:19.340]  We're well known for the arise
[09:19.540 --> 09:23.720]  Lemon Jeffrey orange chasm a lot of great stuff comes from I say our it's me
[09:23.720 --> 09:27.780]  But say our you say our does make company sound professional and it's ours
[09:27.780 --> 09:31.300]  There's a lot of people out there that do help me behind the scenes and stuff shout out to the packaging crew
[09:31.500 --> 09:37.980]  They know who they are, but I read genetics premium seeds is all me. I'm the breeder sole proprietor founder
[09:37.980 --> 09:42.620]  I am I read genetics premium seeds. That's me. Check us out at I read genetics comm now
[09:42.620 --> 09:46.580]  We can talk about what this person is more asking about they say concerning I read genetics
[09:46.580 --> 09:53.220]  They're gonna focus on my seed brand here. It says what factors influence a decision to retire a strain
[09:53.460 --> 09:58.260]  So you'll notice that on some of the vending websites some on some spots on my website
[09:58.260 --> 10:01.660]  It says that this train strain has been discontinued or retired
[10:02.100 --> 10:07.740]  What influences my decision to discontinue or retire a strain? There are a lot of things that go into that
[10:08.340 --> 10:10.340]  a lot of it is
[10:11.180 --> 10:17.260]  Honestly does it sell sometimes I will make a strain it will be hot fire. I'll think it's gonna sell like crazy
[10:17.260 --> 10:18.980]  I'll have thousands of seeds of it
[10:18.980 --> 10:21.220]  I'll market it the way that I normally do
[10:21.420 --> 10:26.060]  Advertise the way I do do my strategy give it out to a bunch of great growers that take great photos
[10:26.180 --> 10:32.540]  Spread it around the world go to sell it and there's no steam that strain just doesn't go anywhere
[10:32.540 --> 10:35.800]  So I've got bags of that seed sitting around when it comes time to make more seeds
[10:35.800 --> 10:43.720]  Guess what? I don't make more of that shit. It's just a lot of it is what sells unfortunately. That's what it's a business
[10:43.720 --> 10:47.660]  It's a seed company. So that's what drives a lot of decisions is business what sells
[10:48.300 --> 10:50.860]  Something is not selling and I've got bags of it sitting around
[10:51.380 --> 10:56.180]  It's I'm not gonna make any more of it. There's no need so that's the bottom line, honestly
[10:56.820 --> 10:58.780]  We talked about grow from your heart and everything
[10:58.780 --> 11:02.020]  But as a seed breeder, I breed with love grow from my heart
[11:02.020 --> 11:08.140]  But when it comes to keeping inventory and deciding what to remake the bottom line is what sells and what seeds are gonna sit there
[11:08.140 --> 11:10.900]  I don't want to have a bunch of useless seeds that nobody wants. So
[11:11.380 --> 11:16.460]  Bottom line is what sells another thing is the mother plant makes a big decision
[11:16.460 --> 11:22.420]  Let's talk about a strain a couple of strains. I have recently retired or discontinued. Let's talk about the Rocksteady
[11:22.940 --> 11:28.300]  Rocksteady was part of the TMNT line Rocksteady came from the Durban poison female
[11:29.020 --> 11:31.020]  also, what came from that the
[11:31.220 --> 11:33.260]  the dragon punch came from the
[11:33.940 --> 11:37.920]  The Durban poison female plant both of those strains have been retired
[11:38.340 --> 11:43.220]  Because that mother plant was a pain in the ass to keep in the garden that Durban poison plant
[11:43.380 --> 11:50.300]  Did not she just didn't fit the program the other plants liked a certain light cycle a certain feeding regimen a certain VPD and
[11:50.780 --> 11:57.940]  That Durban poison plant did not want to participate that little bitch wanted its own VPD its own feeding regimen its own
[11:58.060 --> 12:03.020]  details and I can't have a prima donna in my garden like that if I'm trying to run a schedule and a
[12:03.260 --> 12:05.700]  Just the way I'm trying to do it. It didn't work
[12:05.700 --> 12:12.380]  So that led to all of the subsequent breeding projects from that plant being abandoned and discontinued
[12:12.380 --> 12:14.180]  So the Rocksteady is gone
[12:14.180 --> 12:18.860]  The double dragon is gone and that's because I did not like working with that mother plant
[12:19.060 --> 12:24.660]  Another thing that determines on if I keep it in the breeding stable or not is how many seeds does it make?
[12:25.060 --> 12:29.460]  A lot of plants give me a generous amount of seeds the Mac
[12:29.900 --> 12:33.900]  Sucks at giving me seeds if I put and this these are just hypothetical numbers
[12:33.900 --> 12:36.140]  I'm gonna make up some numbers here if I put a
[12:36.500 --> 12:43.780]  Strawberry starburst plant right here and a Mac one plant right here and I pollinate them both equally with a King Solomon plant if this
[12:44.020 --> 12:46.500]  Strawberry starburst plant were to make a thousand seeds
[12:46.500 --> 12:53.680]  I'm just making up a number this Mac one plant may give me five maybe twenty seeds if I'm absolutely lucky
[12:55.060 --> 13:00.700]  Excuse me for that. I've tried to pollinate the Mac at different times. I've tried to pollinate the Mac at different intervals
[13:00.700 --> 13:04.580]  I've tried different tricks to pollinate the Mac plant and it's just stingy
[13:04.580 --> 13:08.140]  It doesn't want to give me enough seeds to make it worth my production time
[13:08.140 --> 13:09.580]  So when I'm breeding
[13:09.580 --> 13:13.960]  I just put one little small plant of the Mac of the room in the room and let it get hit with pollen and if it
[13:13.960 --> 13:17.700]  Makes seeds it does and I'm excited and if not, that's what we fucking expected
[13:17.700 --> 13:22.540]  We just smoked the Mac buds the way they are. So a lot of it is how many seeds does a plant produce?
[13:23.200 --> 13:29.260]  Also does the mother plant just basically fit in the program? I talked about that Durban poison if it doesn't fit the program
[13:29.260 --> 13:31.820]  It's got to go. I've got a certain way
[13:32.380 --> 13:37.060]  I run my grow a certain schedule a certain style. It's like I'm just gonna pick a brand
[13:37.060 --> 13:41.620]  This is a Volkswagen shop. And if you bring in Ferrari parts, they got to go do you know, right?
[13:41.620 --> 13:46.240]  They're great parts, but they just don't fit on my Volkswagen. Maybe they do. I'm not the engineer here
[13:46.240 --> 13:48.240]  But you guys get what I'm saying, right?
[13:48.500 --> 13:50.920]  Yeah, so if it doesn't fit the program is just got to go
[13:50.920 --> 13:55.960]  So it's all about that mother plant may get it tossed out sales if you guys aren't into it
[13:55.960 --> 13:59.740]  If you guys aren't buying those seeds, there's no need for me to keep it going. I will retire it
[14:00.580 --> 14:02.580]  Production and then a big thing is
[14:03.100 --> 14:10.260]  The market I'm trying to I get bored of things. Honestly, I've got ADD you could tell by watching this podcast
[14:10.260 --> 14:12.120]  I've got a little bit of the ADD there
[14:12.120 --> 14:18.000]  I get bored of growing smoking breeding playing working with all the same shit forever and also
[14:18.800 --> 14:23.280]  Added to that we are limited by the amount of plants. We are allowed to have here in Colorado
[14:23.280 --> 14:26.860]  I can have six because of my recreational rights here in Colorado
[14:26.860 --> 14:33.060]  I'm allowed six extra because my medical cannabis rights here in Colorado that limits me to 12 plants in my grow
[14:33.680 --> 14:40.460]  So imagine trying to breed having 12 plants you select your very favorite keepers and then you've got a few that you can pollinate
[14:40.460 --> 14:46.540]  I'm only allowed to have so many so that means that the only the best of the best are able to stick around
[14:46.540 --> 14:51.900]  I've got to get rid of some stuff and anytime I want to bring in something new that means that something else has to go
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.740]  So hopefully I've got a friend around here with the grow that's got some empty space and they can run a few things
[14:56.860 --> 14:58.100]  And help me select stuff
[14:58.100 --> 15:02.620]  Then we run a pack of seeds find the keeper out of that and their legal six plant grow
[15:02.700 --> 15:06.540]  Then I decide which one of my babies I got a call and get rid of that is a challenge
[15:06.780 --> 15:10.980]  Cut that bitch down bring the keeper from the other grow add that right to the numbers
[15:10.980 --> 15:16.020]  We're still still staying at the legal amounts. Everybody's in their legal numbers. That's how things have to go
[15:16.020 --> 15:21.540]  So sometimes it's just all about how many plants were allowed to have also, it's all about moving forward
[15:22.020 --> 15:26.980]  Once so the irie army the people who buy irie genetic seeds, there's a very nice
[15:27.740 --> 15:30.560]  Occult if you will of people who if I put out a pack of seeds
[15:30.560 --> 15:32.260]  I'm sure I can sell this many
[15:32.260 --> 15:39.100]  Then there are other people who find me through websites and new customers and whatever you want to call them new clients that develop over
[15:39.100 --> 15:44.480]  Time, but I've got a nice little core of people who will buy so many then there's a fringe and then there's the new customers
[15:44.940 --> 15:48.020]  Once the core has got them. They kind of stop selling
[15:48.020 --> 15:52.220]  It's like a baseball card once the all the collectors have the baseball cards, they don't sell anymore
[15:52.220 --> 15:58.140]  So then it's time for me to make new baseball cards find the new hit player and that is part of being a seed company
[15:58.140 --> 16:01.520]  I'm always making new things finding new stuff keeping cannabis evolving
[16:01.520 --> 16:02.900]  I like to breed
[16:02.900 --> 16:08.340]  Brand new things and then go back and find that brand new shit and breed that back to some of my older school stuff just
[16:08.340 --> 16:15.740]  to revive that and keep new stuff coming as a seed breeder a business person a cannabis connoisseur a
[16:16.740 --> 16:19.280]  Passionate botanist I guess you might want to call me
[16:19.280 --> 16:23.220]  I am a person with fucking adult attention disorder or whatever you want to call that
[16:23.220 --> 16:27.860]  I just have to have new things new breeding projects new plants can't sit still
[16:27.860 --> 16:31.540]  I think when I sit still that's said it earlier when I sit still that's when I get bored
[16:31.540 --> 16:34.580]  I cause problems for not necessarily problems, but you know
[16:34.580 --> 16:38.020]  That's when you end up fucking in a fucking battle on Facebook or something wasting your time
[16:38.780 --> 16:40.580]  the
[16:40.580 --> 16:44.140]  Idle hands or the devil's playground is what I think I'm trying to say. So I keep myself busy
[16:44.740 --> 16:49.580]  Focused on the business focused on breeding focused on plants. That's how my brain works
[16:49.580 --> 16:55.820]  So that is a big factor on what decides to retire a strain sales are the bottom line
[16:55.820 --> 17:01.540]  How do you guys react to it? Also if I discover that somebody else has the same strain name as me
[17:01.540 --> 17:05.300]  I will just stop making that strain. I don't want to compete with anybody
[17:05.300 --> 17:09.660]  I don't want to piss anybody off if that person that man that woman used that name
[17:09.660 --> 17:11.020]  They deserve the right to that name
[17:11.020 --> 17:15.660]  I don't want to step on their toes if I made a faux pas a cannabis mistake a breeder mistake
[17:15.660 --> 17:22.580]  And I didn't do my due diligence and researching that name. I will simply retire my cross just to show that I
[17:23.340 --> 17:28.600]  Respect the other person they're breeding their selections their names their game cannabis in general
[17:28.600 --> 17:32.060]  So that's another reason why shit gets retired sometimes simply because of the name
[17:32.400 --> 17:35.900]  The mother plant has a lot to do with it the female plant
[17:36.060 --> 17:40.260]  The production from that female plant has a lot to do with it. I feel like I'm repeating myself
[17:40.580 --> 17:42.580]  sometimes I realized that
[17:43.660 --> 17:47.860]  Feminized crosses it's a pain in the ass to make a lot of feminized crosses
[17:47.860 --> 17:51.860]  Sometimes I realized I got myself in over my head and I just simply don't want to make that anymore
[17:52.420 --> 17:54.420]  Because the plant doesn't make enough
[17:54.580 --> 17:57.440]  Also, sometimes and you guys will know what I'm talking about here
[17:57.440 --> 18:03.500]  Sometimes I name strains after a bunch of famous cartoon characters and they get way more popular than I anticipated
[18:03.500 --> 18:07.340]  It would ever get and then I fear that I'm going to get a cease and desist letter and they're going to sue me
[18:07.620 --> 18:11.140]  That may be why a few strains got retired here
[18:11.140 --> 18:13.660]  You guys probably know which ones I'm talking about if you followed along
[18:13.660 --> 18:16.540]  But that is why some things get discontinued and retired
[18:16.540 --> 18:22.980]  There are several reasons a lot of it is just basic business what sells and what doesn't sometimes the names are used
[18:23.100 --> 18:27.660]  Sometimes I fear that cease and desist letter. All right, there is a second part to this question
[18:27.660 --> 18:30.980]  I hope I can cover this one as well as I did the first part. It says
[18:31.540 --> 18:34.360]  Concerning pheno hunting. This will be good. I love pheno hunting
[18:34.360 --> 18:40.960]  Let's say what a pheno hunt is a pheno hunt is when you've got a package of seeds a number of seeds a population
[18:40.960 --> 18:47.600]  And you were growing them to select the phenotype from that batch of seeds that performs best for your needs
[18:47.600 --> 18:52.640]  It could be your medical needs your recreational needs your hustling market needs
[18:52.640 --> 18:55.280]  I don't know if you're selling it smoking it trading it pressing it
[18:55.280 --> 18:58.460]  But the one that fits your needs your grow your desires the best
[18:58.540 --> 19:04.020]  You were trying to find the phenotype out of a package of seeds because when you're growing from seed there will be
[19:04.540 --> 19:10.100]  Variation you'll find different phenotypes. That's what we call the variants different phenos different expressions
[19:10.100 --> 19:12.420]  So you want to find the one that works best for you?
[19:12.420 --> 19:15.420]  That is a pheno hunt we do that by growing them out take a clone
[19:15.900 --> 19:21.820]  Finish the plants smoke grow them smoke them find which one you like the best then you got a clone of each one kept back
[19:21.820 --> 19:25.980]  You can do it all over again. Now. That's a pheno hunt in the quick way
[19:26.260 --> 19:31.420]  When growing out a pack of 10 seeds by what week from germination
[19:31.420 --> 19:36.020]  Have you made your decision to call a pair for breeding?
[19:36.020 --> 19:41.540]  So the question is basically if I've got a 10 pack of seeds that I plan to breed with how far into?
[19:41.820 --> 19:48.500]  The how far from germination do I select breeders and do I start removing things from the gene pool?
[19:49.140 --> 19:51.140]  That's a very good question
[19:51.140 --> 19:53.940]  And it's got there's no solid answer
[19:53.940 --> 20:01.540]  There's a lot of variation to that sometimes I'll see early on that that plant right there is really slow and shitty and
[20:01.700 --> 20:03.340]  Just doesn't do
[20:03.340 --> 20:07.380]  So the main part of breeding I guess let me back up the main part of breeding is having a goal
[20:07.380 --> 20:09.380]  What are you what are you trying to do?
[20:09.500 --> 20:13.020]  If you're trying to make pizza you need pizza ingredients if you're trying to make
[20:13.460 --> 20:17.980]  What's something if you're trying to make a fucking pumpkin pie you need vastly different ingredients?
[20:17.980 --> 20:21.660]  So if I'm growing a plant trying to make pizza and it's showing me pumpkin pie traits
[20:21.700 --> 20:23.860]  Why keep it around that one goes early
[20:23.860 --> 20:26.580]  But if I'm seeing hints of pizza over here on these traits
[20:26.660 --> 20:29.660]  Then I'll keep those pizza plants because I'm trying to make me some pizza
[20:29.660 --> 20:32.600]  So that is a big part of it find what my goal is
[20:33.120 --> 20:35.520]  Then just get rid of the plants that don't reach the goal
[20:35.660 --> 20:42.660]  Basically, then we'll look for the mutants the weirdos the oddities just things that are obviously not what I want
[20:42.660 --> 20:47.740]  Maybe that one like I said earlier grows too slow. Maybe it's too finicky. Maybe it doesn't want enough water
[20:47.740 --> 20:50.380]  Maybe it's super thirsty and it wants a whole bunch of water
[20:51.020 --> 20:53.300]  That plant those plants will slowly get cold
[20:54.300 --> 20:55.460]  sometimes
[20:55.460 --> 20:57.460]  Sometimes it's really early really really early
[20:57.660 --> 21:03.800]  Sometimes it's the middle of the veg phase a lot of times I can spot the boys from the girls because the boys get real
[21:03.800 --> 21:09.540]  Tall if I'm not looking for boys, sometimes I'll just take the liberty to toss that super tall plant. Also, it's too tall
[21:10.460 --> 21:14.780]  Probably didn't fit the fucking breeding program. I start watching the structure of the plan
[21:14.780 --> 21:18.660]  You can tell that early in veg three four, maybe five weeks into veg
[21:18.660 --> 21:21.060]  You can tell what you're working with by the shape the structure
[21:21.460 --> 21:27.020]  Start giving it some stem rubs. See what it can handle if it can't handle my rooms my regimen my way of growing
[21:27.660 --> 21:32.300]  It's got to go so that can happen all the way through veg sometimes up into flower
[21:32.460 --> 21:36.060]  Sometimes I don't even decide that they've got to go and tell flower
[21:36.140 --> 21:40.200]  Sometimes you don't see I look for bud set doesn't start making big chunky buzz
[21:40.200 --> 21:45.500]  Does it make small spindly buds? Does it take a long time to kick into flower? Does it stretch a whole bunch?
[21:45.780 --> 21:50.420]  Does it do the dreaded intersex trait if it does that it goes immediately?
[21:50.420 --> 21:56.580]  I can find an intersex trait a week to a flower or week nine a flower and we're just gonna chop that bitch down and
[21:56.580 --> 21:58.020]  Get rid of it and not do it again
[21:58.020 --> 22:04.460]  So I got all the way up till sometimes we don't decide that we're gonna call something for a breeding project or make a final
[22:04.460 --> 22:08.200]  Decision until we actually smoke the finished product. You got to grow them
[22:08.780 --> 22:14.300]  Finish them dry them cure them smoke them then make your final decision a lot of times
[22:14.540 --> 22:19.460]  I'll grow in larger batches of ten. I had some commercial facilities going where we could grow larger numbers
[22:19.460 --> 22:21.980]  You'd grow quite a few you'd narrow it down to the top
[22:22.500 --> 22:29.620]  Two three, maybe the top five and grow those again because the first time we just did a sample run didn't do anything fancy
[22:29.620 --> 22:32.620]  We just did a phenol hunt everything got the same treatment
[22:32.620 --> 22:36.700]  Now we know that that one plant could have used more cow mag that one likes more nitrogen
[22:36.700 --> 22:40.980]  So we'll run the top three or five again and see which one stands out from that
[22:41.380 --> 22:44.420]  Dry them cure them smoke them do it all over again
[22:44.420 --> 22:50.120]  So sometimes I can call them early if they're funky if they're ugly not doing what I want. They got to go early
[22:50.700 --> 22:58.340]  Sometimes middle of veg sometimes early flower sometimes late in flower. It just kind of depends a lot of times
[22:58.340 --> 23:03.540]  I will make it's more more common for me to make decisions on what I really want to keep
[23:04.020 --> 23:08.300]  Kind of late in veg. I can see it. I just oh, I like the structure of that little girl right there
[23:08.300 --> 23:12.700]  That plants gonna be a boy. I'm gonna put them in a room together. Those are gonna be beautiful
[23:12.980 --> 23:17.340]  Sometimes I can just see it. I just get a hint. I just get a vibe. I get a feeling from these plants
[23:17.900 --> 23:23.980]  Sometimes however, we've got to smoke them and sit in a room and go man number three tastes really good
[23:23.980 --> 23:28.780]  But number four gives me a really good buzz, but number five really produced a lot more
[23:28.780 --> 23:31.060]  So you got things to think about as a commercial grower?
[23:31.300 --> 23:36.380]  So sometimes we don't know until the end then then let me go even a step further
[23:36.580 --> 23:41.540]  Sometimes we don't know until we have extracted it. What's the purpose of this plant? I'm a dabber
[23:41.540 --> 23:43.540]  I like to smoke batters and concentrates
[23:43.820 --> 23:48.260]  Why not do some extraction and then decide which one makes the best extracts?
[23:48.260 --> 23:53.620]  Maybe that flavor and that potency maybe they switch places once you run it through the extraction equipment
[23:53.620 --> 23:56.120]  Maybe the one that tasted better is now more potent
[23:56.120 --> 24:01.340]  Maybe the one that was more potent now tastes better after you run it through the extraction equipment. Maybe one phenotype
[24:02.020 --> 24:07.660]  Really dumps out the trichomes and puts out a lot of concentrates when you press it squish it wash it run it whatever you're gonna
[24:07.660 --> 24:12.460]  Do then if that's our goal, that will be our phenotypical selection there. So
[24:13.860 --> 24:16.320]  That I know that's a really open-ended answer
[24:16.840 --> 24:21.220]  But also let me add even more onto that long-winded open-ended answers sometimes
[24:22.660 --> 24:24.660]  So you said for a breeding program?
[24:24.700 --> 24:28.900]  We are simply selecting plants that are going to be bred with we're looking for the boy
[24:29.380 --> 24:36.180]  I have a really tight criteria. I'm looking for boys. I've talked about I can eliminate boys quickly if they don't fit my criteria
[24:36.180 --> 24:40.780]  I know more what doesn't fit for boys. I could just be like now that's not gonna work. That's not gonna work
[24:40.940 --> 24:47.300]  So we've got our boys in one room now. That's a different conversation. We've got our girls. We smoke and finish the girls
[24:47.660 --> 24:52.080]  Now we've got three females that we were considering pollinating with our selected male
[24:52.320 --> 24:59.340]  Now we've got to pollinate and grow them and then see which of those phenotypes produce the best
[24:59.760 --> 25:05.560]  Offspring that's where we are now with the Jack the Ripper f2. I pollinated multiple females with one male
[25:05.560 --> 25:09.440]  I've sent it out that sent out the testers with clear indicators
[25:09.440 --> 25:14.820]  There's numbers two four and five and possibly number three. I don't know if number three has been sent out for testing yet
[25:14.820 --> 25:19.240]  I just didn't look like one of the keepers. I did not keep that one for continued generations
[25:19.360 --> 25:25.840]  But we sent out two four and five for testing and now we will find out if the Jack the Ripper from this male
[25:26.000 --> 25:32.400]  One male pollinated multiple females. We'll find out which of the females performs better and we'll put those to market
[25:32.400 --> 25:34.400]  Maybe I'll put both of them out. We'll call it
[25:34.440 --> 25:39.480]  JTR f2 number four and JTR f2 number two, and we'll simply market both of them
[25:39.880 --> 25:43.720]  Maybe we'll do some inbreeding like we talked about on a previous episode
[25:43.720 --> 25:46.640]  I am going to correct some of those terms we spoke of also
[25:47.160 --> 25:54.080]  But sometimes I don't make my final selections until I see what the seeds do that come from that
[25:54.080 --> 25:59.480]  So right now I've got the Jack the Ripper number two and number four female on deck in a grow space somewhere
[25:59.680 --> 26:07.240]  Once we determine which progeny is better. I'll call one of those and I'll keep the one that makes the best offspring. So
[26:08.040 --> 26:10.680]  That has gone really far. The plants have been
[26:11.240 --> 26:13.240]  dried cured smoked then
[26:13.400 --> 26:15.400]  regrown pollinated
[26:16.360 --> 26:18.360]  Tested and they are still in testing
[26:18.520 --> 26:22.040]  Once the testing batch is some of the first rounds of the blueberry
[26:22.040 --> 26:27.640]  Cookies to Jack the Ripper and Jack the Ripper f2s are coming down this week and being tested. I'm super excited for that
[26:27.640 --> 26:29.640]  They're coming down and getting smoked really soon
[26:29.680 --> 26:32.320]  Once they get smoked and we decide which one was better
[26:32.600 --> 26:36.600]  Then I can eliminate the parent of the one I don't like the most so there were
[26:36.880 --> 26:42.000]  Multiple cycles gone through while I kept both of those parents around just to see which worked best
[26:42.040 --> 26:45.120]  You guys that's why seeds are not super cheap sometimes
[26:45.120 --> 26:50.800]  It looks like we're just making two plants fuck, but there's a lot of selection going when it's done properly
[26:50.800 --> 26:56.680]  There's a lot of care selection preparation into it. Then there's time to make the seeds after the seeds are made
[26:56.680 --> 27:02.480]  They got to be separated sorted sorted package sent out tested thoroughly thoroughly tested. I
[27:03.520 --> 27:06.200]  Pay for every package I sent out to test out of my pocket
[27:06.200 --> 27:10.340]  That's eight bucks worth of shipping every time a package goes out. I sent out a lot of those
[27:11.180 --> 27:15.940]  They got to be tested then we've got to market them then you got to repackage them up for sales
[27:15.940 --> 27:17.620]  You got to send them out to the vendors
[27:17.620 --> 27:21.860]  Then you got to make more seeds because once they're tested people see the pictures from the testers they get hot
[27:21.940 --> 27:25.920]  That's why seeds are not cheap because there's a lot of work that goes on in the background
[27:25.920 --> 27:29.220]  We don't just get two plants and make them fuck and put out seeds if we're doing it correctly
[27:29.380 --> 27:35.580]  There's a lot of forethought a lot of testing a lot of R&D goes into it. Let's see. Where are we on this?
[27:35.580 --> 27:40.220]  I think I answered most of this one. Sometimes I call them early sometimes in veg
[27:40.540 --> 27:44.060]  Sometimes in flower. Sometimes you got to smoke them. Sometimes you got to dab them
[27:44.300 --> 27:49.460]  Sometimes you got to breed with them see which one works the best then keep the keeper get rid of the non
[27:49.740 --> 27:53.720]  Keeper, sometimes I'll do that with a male also when I was looking for Solomon
[27:53.720 --> 27:57.780]  I went through a lot of seeds to find Solomon. I was really picky
[27:57.780 --> 28:00.220]  I didn't see what I wanted exactly in a male plant
[28:00.460 --> 28:04.060]  finally, I found it and I feel like I made the right selection you guys because
[28:04.500 --> 28:06.900]  Solomon is a bad mo fro
