[00:00.000 --> 00:04.960]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World. It's time for episode 369 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:04.960 --> 00:09.680]  Podcast. This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you need new
[00:09.680 --> 00:14.600]  seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can find
[00:14.600 --> 00:21.640]  them at www.dankseed.store. You guys know I like to start the show off by letting you
[00:21.640 --> 00:26.680]  know what I'm smoking. Today, I'm taking dabs of something called Fluffernutter Sauce from
[00:26.680 --> 00:31.460]  Contraband Concentrates. I picked this up at a cut above in Colorado Springs. This stuff
[00:31.460 --> 00:35.280]  has a very unique aroma and flavor to it. I'm going to bust the container open again
[00:35.280 --> 00:40.920]  just to get a fresh smell to try to explain this to you. It's got that dryer sheet sort
[00:40.920 --> 00:45.320]  of smell that I really enjoy. A lot of the concentrates from Contraband have that dryer
[00:45.320 --> 00:50.280]  sheet terp. I'm not sure which terp that is. It really smells great. My body really likes
[00:50.280 --> 00:55.800]  it. It's kind of sweet. It's kind of sharp. It's got almost a citrus thing to it. And
[00:55.800 --> 00:58.440]  if you let it sit on the nose for a minute and you just give it a nice smell and let
[00:58.440 --> 01:03.160]  it rest, it has a really warm aroma to it, something warm in the background. That may
[01:03.160 --> 01:07.760]  sound crazy. A lot of people tell me that my strain descriptions are completely crazy.
[01:07.760 --> 01:10.720]  But if you bought a gram of this and you cracked it open and gave it a smell, you would say
[01:10.720 --> 01:14.700]  that is sweet with a hint of citrus with a little warmth at the end, and you would probably
[01:14.700 --> 01:18.880]  agree with me. You guys, I always love the high of the products I buy from Contraband
[01:18.880 --> 01:24.800]  Concentrates. It's always got that nice head buzz. I feel like maybe that sharp dryer sheet
[01:24.800 --> 01:29.000]  sort of aroma has something to do with the head buzz that I get from this concentrate.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.840]  Anyway, they always do a good job. Big shout out to the Fluffernutter Sauce from Contraband
[01:32.840 --> 01:38.520]  Concentrates. It's obviously got me nice and rambly. This will be a great podcast.
[01:38.520 --> 01:41.960]  I do have a lot of great information written down for you in this episode, but before we
[01:41.960 --> 01:46.360]  get to it, I would like to give a few people some shout outs. Let's start off with Brett
[01:46.360 --> 01:50.000]  Gorman. How about a big, giant shout out to Brett Gorman? Thanks for all the support,
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.920]  dude. Also, a big shout out to Aldridge once again. I totally appreciate that support.
[01:54.040 --> 01:59.520]  Also, a shout out to Sam and Steve F. Thank you for all of the support on Patreon. I truly
[01:59.520 --> 02:04.200]  do appreciate that. If you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going

[02:09.520 --> 02:12.680]  Once again, thanks for all the support, everybody. It does mean a lot to me.
[02:12.680 --> 02:17.160]  All right, podcast world. In this episode, I am going to do another grow lesson. If you
[02:17.160 --> 02:21.800]  have been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons. In that
[02:21.800 --> 02:26.600]  series, we set a goal for our grow. We found a safe place for our grow. We've selected
[02:26.600 --> 02:30.880]  the appropriate equipment for our grow. We've also selected the appropriate nutrients and
[02:30.880 --> 02:35.840]  pest management system for that grow. Now, we have either sprouted seeds or potted some
[02:35.840 --> 02:41.040]  clones. Now, in this point of our grow, we have got clones or seedlings in small pots.
[02:41.040 --> 02:45.080]  They're probably six to 10 inches tall at this point, and they're developing nice fat
[02:45.080 --> 02:49.680]  roots. That's where we are in these grow lessons. In this lesson, I plan to talk a little bit
[02:49.680 --> 02:54.240]  more about small veg. We're going to continue that conversation since time has progressed,
[02:54.240 --> 02:58.240]  since we put our plants into the small pots. Then, I want to work my way into talking about
[02:58.240 --> 03:02.800]  microbe products and root development and the importance of healthy roots and the benefits
[03:02.800 --> 03:06.400]  of using a quality microbe product.
[03:06.400 --> 03:09.960]  Some of this episode may feel like a recap. Some of it will be a recap, but we will work
[03:09.960 --> 03:14.080]  our way right into our current state, so be patient. Sometimes I feel like it's good to
[03:14.080 --> 03:19.300]  remind people. Not everybody listens to every episode, so I like to get people up to speed.
[03:19.420 --> 03:24.380]  Before I move forward, I do need to correct myself. I made a mistake on the last episode.
[03:24.380 --> 03:28.500]  In the last episode, I was talking about ideal lighting for our small plants, and I feel
[03:28.500 --> 03:33.780]  like I completely overlooked ceramic metal halide lighting. Ceramic metal halide lighting
[03:33.780 --> 03:38.420]  is a very viable and useful option for your small plants. If you feel like I left you
[03:38.420 --> 03:43.100]  out by not mentioning the CMH lighting, I apologize. Those are quality lights, and I
[03:43.100 --> 03:47.540]  recommend new growers to use those lights for small plants if that is an option. They
[03:47.540 --> 03:51.500]  are affordable, they don't put out a lot of light, and they don't use a lot of electricity.
[03:51.500 --> 03:56.420]  So a ceramic metal halide light is a very viable option for a small grow, for a new
[03:56.420 --> 04:01.660]  grower, for small plants. Also, if you want to step up, move up from the 315s to the 630s,
[04:01.660 --> 04:06.700]  I've seen great results with those in a flowering room as well. So don't let me forget the ceramic
[04:06.700 --> 04:11.180]  metal halide lighting anymore. That is always a viable option in a cannabis grow.
[04:11.180 --> 04:16.740]  Now let's get back on track and talk more about continuing our small veg phase. Again,
[04:16.740 --> 04:22.540]  what I consider small veg are small plants. Anything basically from a cloner or a seedling
[04:22.540 --> 04:26.420]  that is in a small pot, maybe like a 4 inch pot, maybe a 6 inch net pot, maybe all the
[04:26.420 --> 04:31.020]  way up to an 8 inch pot. But our smaller plants that don't have a super strong healthy developed
[04:31.020 --> 04:35.940]  root system are plants that are probably only 8 to 10 inches tall. Those are what I am considering
[04:35.940 --> 04:38.260]  my small veg plants.
[04:38.260 --> 04:43.140]  Now up to this point, we've mainly been focusing on healthy, pest and pathogen free plants.
[04:43.140 --> 04:48.140]  I suggest you check every day for the presence of pests or pathogens. Even as the plants
[04:48.140 --> 04:53.120]  are small, we still need to pay close attention. Flip a leaf over, see if you see any weirdness
[04:53.120 --> 04:56.740]  on the bottom of the leaves. Pay attention to the tops of the leaves. Do you see any
[04:56.740 --> 05:00.540]  stippling? That's a sign of spider mites. Do you see any gooey stuff? That's a sign
[05:00.540 --> 05:04.820]  of thrips. Just pay attention. Flick some of the plants, flick some of the containers.
[05:04.820 --> 05:09.340]  Do you see anything fly out? That is a sign of either fungus gnats or white flies. If
[05:09.340 --> 05:12.780]  they're white, they're white flies. If they're black, they're probably fungus gnats. Just
[05:12.780 --> 05:16.860]  pay attention for pests in our small plants. It's really easy to take care of them if we
[05:16.860 --> 05:21.920]  do get them, but we need to identify our problems early so that we can conquer them before they
[05:21.920 --> 05:23.420]  get out of control.
[05:23.420 --> 05:28.180]  So go in and check for pests every day. Check for powdery mildew. You should be able to
[05:28.180 --> 05:32.820]  spot it on these little plants very easily. It will start in the center of a leaf. It
[05:32.820 --> 05:36.580]  will usually start at the widest point of one of your biggest leaves and it will look
[05:36.580 --> 05:40.700]  like somebody just took a little drop of donut powdered sugar and just dropped it right
[05:40.700 --> 05:45.220]  on your leaf. It'll look like some sort of white powdery water that dried up and just
[05:45.220 --> 05:49.820]  left a little stain right there. That is the first indicator of powdery mildew. It will
[05:49.820 --> 05:54.180]  probably happen in a low light area. We are not getting a lot of light, but there is a
[05:54.180 --> 05:58.820]  lot of moisture. Oftentimes it'll happen where that little bit of water just hangs on that
[05:58.820 --> 06:02.740]  one leaf in that one spot and it never quite goes away. That's where you're going to get
[06:02.740 --> 06:08.180]  the PM. So pay attention for bugs, pay attention for powdery mildew. Our main goal right now
[06:08.180 --> 06:13.060]  is to keep these plants pest and pathogen free and keep them developing strong, healthy
[06:13.060 --> 06:17.780]  root systems so that we have strong, healthy plants when it's time to transplant them and
[06:17.780 --> 06:20.060]  then later move them into flower.
[06:20.060 --> 06:23.020]  Now that your plants are starting to grow and you've spent some time with them, you've
[06:23.020 --> 06:27.180]  probably seen what happens when you over and underwater them a little bit. You've probably
[06:27.180 --> 06:31.960]  done one or the other, which has probably caused a little bit of funky leaves. I encourage
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.720]  you to pull off all of the ugly leaves. If you've got yellowing, crispy leaves, take
[06:36.720 --> 06:42.640]  those off. Those yellow leaves are an invitation for spider mites. That's why we use yellow
[06:42.640 --> 06:46.560]  sticky cards in the garden to help the pests go to those cards. We see them on the cards
[06:46.560 --> 06:50.280]  and we can tell that they're there, but the pests love to go to that yellow. They think
[06:50.280 --> 06:55.080]  that is a weak leaf. Imagine you're a hungry spider mite and you see a big, healthy, robust
[06:55.080 --> 06:59.240]  leaf that's got a really thick layer of healthy vegetation to chew through before you can
[06:59.240 --> 07:03.000]  get some nutrients out of it. Or imagine just a little lower on the plant, you've
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.040]  got a weak leaf that's yellow on the outside. It's got a real thin layer and you can just
[07:07.040 --> 07:10.320]  poke right through it and suck all the juice you want right out of it like a hungry little
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.760]  vampire bug you are. You're going to go right to those weak, yellow leaves. It's not as
[07:14.760 --> 07:18.440]  much work for food. You can get right in there and get what you need. The spider mites are
[07:18.440 --> 07:22.720]  going right for that yellow, weak part. So pull off all those weak parts. Pull off all
[07:22.720 --> 07:25.880]  the yellow leaves. That's where the problems are going to start anyway. That's where the
[07:25.880 --> 07:28.840]  plant is the weakest. Get that out of there.
[07:28.840 --> 07:32.440]  Now while you're pulling off leaves, you may notice that the couple of branches at
[07:32.440 --> 07:36.240]  the very bottom of your plant are just weak and shitty and kind of in the way. If you've
[07:36.240 --> 07:39.920]  got a couple of leaves that are hanging down into the dirt, pick that stuff right off.
[07:39.920 --> 07:44.720]  We don't need that very bottom crap on the plant. By the time it makes it to flower,
[07:44.720 --> 07:48.520]  we're going to clean up the bottom 8 to 10 inches of that stalk anyway. Those bottom
[07:48.520 --> 07:52.960]  branches will not even be there. I feel like if you take some of those little sucker branches
[07:52.960 --> 07:57.040]  off the bottom now, it will encourage growth up to the top of the plant. We don't need
[07:57.040 --> 08:00.200]  that stuff on the bottom. The light's not going to get to it. That's where the problems
[08:00.200 --> 08:04.560]  are going to happen. Why not cut that stuff right off? If you're happy with the way your
[08:04.560 --> 08:09.320]  plants look without pruning anything off the bottom, you don't have to do it. But if you've
[08:09.320 --> 08:13.000]  got two or three branches on the bottom that just aren't growing to reach the rest of the
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.040]  branches, if they look weak, why not take them off? We don't need that weak shit down
[08:17.040 --> 08:21.640]  there at the bottom of the plant, wasting energy, wasting nutrients, and wasting water.
[08:21.640 --> 08:25.200]  Let's just cut it right off and send that energy right up to the top of the plant. Now
[08:25.200 --> 08:29.000]  as the plants get bigger, you'll notice they're starting to branch out a little bit. On the
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.720]  bottoms of some of the branches, you may start developing shoots. If those little shoots
[08:33.720 --> 08:38.720]  are weak, you can pinch those off as well. You don't have to take off the entire branch.
[08:38.720 --> 08:42.160]  You can just take off the shitty shoots at the bottom, and you can still leave the ends
[08:42.160 --> 08:46.660]  of those branches, and you can still have more bud sites and more branches. Don't take
[08:46.660 --> 08:51.700]  off too much now. You can always take off more in the future. You cannot glue branches
[08:51.700 --> 08:56.060]  back onto the plant. And keep in mind, the plant grows out of the top, so the shit you
[08:56.060 --> 09:00.100]  take off the bottom will not replace itself. You're cleaning up the bottom, that is gone.
[09:00.100 --> 09:03.220]  It's going to grow out of the top. Keep that in mind.
[09:03.220 --> 09:06.540]  Now let's talk a little bit about nutrients. I always recommend starting off with light
[09:06.540 --> 09:10.540]  nutrients. If your plants are showing any yellow, or if they're not growing as quickly
[09:10.540 --> 09:15.300]  as you would like them to, you may need to increase the overall amount of nutrients we
[09:15.300 --> 09:20.140]  are giving the plants. I always recommend starting low and increasing as time goes on.
[09:20.140 --> 09:23.740]  If your plants are a little bit pale or yellowish, if they're not as green as we would hope they
[09:23.740 --> 09:28.540]  would be at this point, it is probably time to increase our nutrients. Also, it may be
[09:28.540 --> 09:33.100]  time to add some cow mag to the mix. If your plants are growing properly, if they're nice
[09:33.100 --> 09:37.300]  and robust, if they've got a nice root system in this small pot, I would recommend adding
[09:37.300 --> 09:41.880]  a small dose of cow mag once a week to your feeding regimen.
[09:41.880 --> 09:45.320]  If you feel like you're feeding your plants properly, you're giving them a proper amount
[09:45.320 --> 09:49.060]  of nitrogen, you're giving them the proper amount of cow mag, you're also giving them
[09:49.060 --> 09:53.060]  some beneficials for the roots, and you're not seeing the growth you would like to see,
[09:53.060 --> 09:58.300]  I would suspect that it's probably a pH issue. Check the pH of the solution you are feeding
[09:58.300 --> 10:03.020]  your plants. If your pH is off, your plants won't be able to uptake nutrients, which means
[10:03.020 --> 10:08.180]  they will not grow. So once you have mixed up your nutrients, put your pH pin in there
[10:08.180 --> 10:13.900]  and see what the pH of that solution is before you feed it to your plants. If it's not in
[10:13.900 --> 10:19.420]  the appropriate range, adjust it. This is such an overlooked step. Most of the time
[10:19.420 --> 10:23.780]  when people send me pictures of their plants, they say, what is wrong with my plant? I ask
[10:23.780 --> 10:28.500]  them, what was the pH of your last feeding solution? You know what most of their answers
[10:28.500 --> 10:33.020]  are? I don't know. So I usually tell them, check the pH and get back to me, because I
[10:33.020 --> 10:37.180]  would assume if you're not checking the pH, that is probably the issue. You didn't even
[10:37.180 --> 10:41.460]  bother to check. How do I know if you've got another nutritional problem? How do I know
[10:41.540 --> 10:46.420]  if you're overfeeding or underfeeding a specific nutrient if I don't know what the pH of your
[10:46.420 --> 10:51.820]  solution is? You have got to dial in the pH. I've done an entire episode on the importance
[10:51.820 --> 10:57.460]  of pH. For these small plants, I really think they would be happiest with a pH right around
[10:57.460 --> 11:03.340]  6.1 or 6.2. You can go 5.8 to 6.3 if you really want to have a wide range, but I think 6.1
[11:03.340 --> 11:09.660]  or 6.2 in cocoa or soilless mix is going to be ideal for these small plants. We may increase
[11:09.660 --> 11:13.460]  that pH as we go along the growth process, as we pay attention to the plants and see
[11:13.460 --> 11:18.500]  how they react to certain things, but for now, I think this 6.2 is right about where
[11:18.500 --> 11:19.500]  we need to be.
[11:19.500 --> 11:22.700]  All right, so we've got clean, healthy plants. We don't have any bugs. We don't have any
[11:22.700 --> 11:27.060]  powdery mildew. We have increased our nutrients to increase our vigor and increase growth
[11:27.060 --> 11:32.220]  speed. It is probably time to spread your plants out. If they are too pressed together,
[11:32.220 --> 11:35.820]  if they're too crowded, they're not going to branch out properly. So if you've got them
[11:35.820 --> 11:39.940]  crushed in there real tight, it's time to spread them out. If it looks like your plants
[11:39.940 --> 11:44.420]  are getting too tall and too skinny and too stretchy, it's one of two things. They either
[11:44.420 --> 11:49.640]  want more light or they are too close together, which probably just means they want more light.
[11:49.640 --> 11:53.360]  If you've got branches pressed together, if you've got leaves pressed together, if you've
[11:53.360 --> 11:57.740]  got plants overlapping each other, if you've got one plant pressed up against the wall,
[11:57.740 --> 12:01.740]  they know they're too tight together and instead of branching out, they're going to go straight
[12:01.740 --> 12:05.840]  up and try to get some light. They are all competing for light space. And you're probably
[12:05.840 --> 12:10.460]  running your small veg under smaller lights, which means they're really competing for that
[12:10.460 --> 12:14.580]  space if we crowd them in. Spread them out. Let them get some light.
[12:14.580 --> 12:19.760]  Light is the number one desired nutrient and source of energy for our plants over their
[12:19.760 --> 12:25.700]  entire life cycles. They want light more than anything. Light is the key. These plants think
[12:25.700 --> 12:30.060]  they're going to get the sun and we brought them indoors and wired up little T5 bulbs
[12:30.380 --> 12:34.020]  and we're trying to make them grow with that. So spoil them and give them as much of that
[12:34.020 --> 12:38.420]  T5 lighting as they can get. Give them as much space as they can handle so that you
[12:38.420 --> 12:42.060]  can get maximum performance from our small plants.
[12:42.060 --> 12:46.500]  So now I feel like we have got healthy plants that are pest free. They're probably about
[12:46.500 --> 12:50.220]  eight to 10 inches tall. We're starting to get nice branching on the bottom. We've cleaned
[12:50.220 --> 12:54.020]  up those crappy branches on the bottom. We've pulled off any funky leaves. We've spread
[12:54.020 --> 12:58.220]  them out so that they're not too crowded. We are probably going to transplant these
[12:58.220 --> 13:03.100]  plants into their forever homes within the next week or two. That's going to be the next
[13:03.100 --> 13:07.820]  grow lesson that I provide. We'll be transplanting into our forever homes.
[13:07.820 --> 13:13.540]  I think one thing we should really focus on until we transplant is fat root development.
[13:13.540 --> 13:18.560]  I like my plants to be nearly root bound in these small pots before I transplant them.
[13:18.560 --> 13:22.840]  I like to have to kind of break that root ball up at transplant to make it explode.
[13:22.840 --> 13:27.260]  It sounds crazy, but if you get that root ball kind of tight in a small pot, when we
[13:27.300 --> 13:32.620]  transplant it into the next pot, it will really take off. We will really see explosive growth.
[13:32.620 --> 13:37.780]  We will have a really robust and healthy plant from the very beginning with a solid foundation.
[13:37.780 --> 13:42.260]  So let's let these plants grow and get kind of tight in their pots. You may see some roots
[13:42.260 --> 13:45.700]  coming out of the bottom of your container. That is a good thing. If those roots are nice
[13:45.700 --> 13:49.340]  and white, that means you were feeding those roots very well, that your plants are very
[13:49.340 --> 13:53.020]  happy, that they're getting a nice amount of moisture, that they're getting a nice amount
[13:53.020 --> 13:57.580]  of dry time, that everything is going well inside your rhizosphere.
[13:57.580 --> 14:00.720]  Now if you want to take a look at your roots and see what kind of root development you're
[14:00.720 --> 14:07.680]  working with, don't be afraid to grab a cup or a pot with a plant in it and put your finger
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.300]  over the pot and kind of make a Spock hand where you're spreading your ring finger and
[14:11.300 --> 14:15.320]  your middle finger apart. Put the stalk of the plant right between those two fingers
[14:15.320 --> 14:19.020]  and then just flip that pot upside down and give it a little bit of a shake. If you're
[14:19.020 --> 14:24.500]  confident, you can pull that pot off and you can look directly at the root development.
[14:24.500 --> 14:27.800]  If you start lifting that pot off and the dirt starts falling out like crazy and it's
[14:27.800 --> 14:31.900]  not compact and pressed together, push it back in there and just leave it alone. The
[14:31.900 --> 14:35.540]  roots are not developed enough to try this experiment. If you start lifting that pot
[14:35.540 --> 14:40.060]  off and all the dirt stays in one piece and you can see those roots, you can just lift
[14:40.060 --> 14:43.660]  that pot right off and you can take a look at the root development. If you can see those
[14:43.660 --> 14:46.940]  roots wrapped around inside of there and all the dirt and all the roots are tight into
[14:46.940 --> 14:51.380]  one piece, that is what we're aiming for. You are almost ready for transplant. I like
[14:51.380 --> 14:55.800]  to let those get almost root bound to where the plant is almost filling that container
[14:55.800 --> 15:00.740]  with roots to where it is almost panicking time to put that into a new pot. I feel like
[15:00.740 --> 15:05.700]  if we wait that long to put it into our next pot, we get explosive root growth when we
[15:05.700 --> 15:10.340]  transplant it into the next container. I also feel like we get less transplant shock and
[15:10.340 --> 15:14.960]  I feel like the plant is more developed and more prepared to go into its larger container.
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.800]  If you are experienced or confident, grab a plant, flip it upside down and knock the
[15:19.800 --> 15:23.960]  container off of it and see what comes out. If all the dirt goes flying and the roots
[15:23.960 --> 15:27.920]  come unraveling and hanging out, just plant that back in there really carefully and it
[15:27.920 --> 15:31.960]  will be okay if you're careful about it. Do your best not to break any of the roots. Don't
[15:31.960 --> 15:35.800]  disturb the roots. You can get them back in there. While you've got it out, sprinkle a
[15:35.800 --> 15:39.680]  little bit of root inoculant powder on there. Sprinkle some Plus Life or some Great White
[15:39.680 --> 15:44.140]  right onto the roots and put it back in there. That inoculant will encourage those roots
[15:44.140 --> 15:47.060]  to grow even more quickly than they already were.
[15:47.060 --> 15:51.100]  All right, Podcast World. I'm going to press pause for a moment. I need to take a drink.
[15:51.100 --> 15:55.020]  I'll probably take a couple of dabs while I'm at it. When I get back, we will talk more
[15:55.020 --> 15:59.440]  about developing healthy roots and we will also talk about mycorrhizal fungus. So take
[15:59.440 --> 16:01.380]  a dab with me and I will be right back.
[16:01.380 --> 16:06.020]  All right, Podcast World. I am back. I am well medicated. I am well hydrated. Let's
[16:06.020 --> 16:11.780]  talk more about healthy roots and mycorrhizal fungus. Before we transfer our small plants
[16:11.820 --> 16:16.660]  into their forever homes, we want to develop thick, healthy, white roots. We want a big,
[16:16.660 --> 16:22.460]  fat root system so that we've got a well-established plant to go into a larger pot. A good microbe
[16:22.460 --> 16:25.780]  product will encourage explosive root growth.
[16:25.780 --> 16:30.680]  Let's talk about some of the other advantages of our mycorrhizal fungus. The first obvious
[16:30.680 --> 16:35.020]  advantage is more roots. More roots means our plants can eat more, which means our plants
[16:35.020 --> 16:39.600]  can drink more, which means our plants will grow more quickly, which means we will produce
[16:39.600 --> 16:43.960]  more branching, which means we will produce more buds, which is our main goal. So the
[16:43.960 --> 16:49.720]  first benefit, more roots, which means more productivity overall from our plants.
[16:49.720 --> 16:54.560]  Another great function of our beneficial fungus is they work as a protective layer or a security
[16:54.560 --> 17:00.680]  guard for our root zone. They protect against pathogen problems and illness in our plants.
[17:00.680 --> 17:04.480]  There's already a colony of beneficial fungus gathered around the roots. If anything else
[17:04.480 --> 17:08.720]  tries to get near it, those colonies say, hey, this is our turf, bro, and they fight
[17:08.720 --> 17:13.120]  off any potential pathogens that want to get to your root zone.
[17:13.120 --> 17:17.620]  Some of our beneficial bacteria work in a similar function as an enzyme. It will break
[17:17.620 --> 17:22.080]  down decaying matter, it will break down nutrients, and it will make it more bioavailable to our
[17:22.080 --> 17:26.520]  plants so our plants can take that waste and actually turn it into food and consume it
[17:26.520 --> 17:31.280]  and use it to its benefit. Now, if you are using a microbe product, I don't recommend
[17:31.280 --> 17:35.880]  that you stop using your enzymes. I recommend you use them together. Let them team up and
[17:35.880 --> 17:41.080]  create a beautiful environment in your rhizosphere that will also create a lot of diversity.
[17:41.080 --> 17:44.680]  You will have multiple things in there breaking down the decaying matter that should really
[17:44.680 --> 17:48.020]  encourage a clean, healthy rhizosphere.
[17:48.020 --> 17:52.720]  Another function of some of our beneficial bacterias is they aid in the processes that
[17:52.720 --> 17:58.440]  encourage branching and bud set. So by introducing these beneficial bacteria, you may see more
[17:58.440 --> 18:03.160]  branching and you may see more bud sites in your plants. Now, another great thing that
[18:03.160 --> 18:08.840]  these beneficial bacterias do is they work to increase essential oil production. Now,
[18:08.840 --> 18:14.440]  what are essential oils? Essential oils are our terpenes and cannabinoids. You can increase
[18:14.440 --> 18:19.240]  the overall production of your plants. You can increase the overall flavor, aroma, and
[18:19.240 --> 18:24.240]  potency of your plants by using the correct mycorrhizal fungus.
[18:24.240 --> 18:29.960]  Now I try to avoid recommending brand names. There are several great mycorrhizal products
[18:29.960 --> 18:34.720]  available at your local growth store. There are tons available online. I will list a few
[18:34.720 --> 18:39.560]  products that I have had great experience with. Of course, I have to recommend Recharge.
[18:39.560 --> 18:44.720]  I really like Recharge. Recharge made my plants go crazy. One of the good things about Recharge
[18:44.720 --> 18:49.720]  is it contains dried molasses, which is constantly feeding the microbes. The microbes do need
[18:49.720 --> 18:54.160]  some sort of fuel. It's already got fuel in that container.
[18:54.160 --> 18:58.680]  Another acceptable myco product is called Extreme Mycos and they spell mycos with a
[18:58.680 --> 19:04.440]  K. It's a great product. It is very affordable. You don't have to buy a very expensive micro
[19:04.440 --> 19:08.880]  product. If you want something that's affordable, if you're just going to try it out, Extreme
[19:08.880 --> 19:14.400]  Mycos is probably one of the most affordable micro products on the market. If you want
[19:14.400 --> 19:19.120]  a liquid micro product, you can get HydroGard from Botanicare.
[19:19.120 --> 19:23.660]  I really like Great White. Great White is a powdered micro product. I like the powders
[19:23.660 --> 19:26.880]  because you can sprinkle them directly onto the roots. We're going to talk more about
[19:26.880 --> 19:31.120]  that when we get to the transplanting episode. But during transplant, I like to sprinkle
[19:31.120 --> 19:35.840]  the powders directly onto the roots and into the hole where I'm transplanting my plant.
[19:35.840 --> 19:40.440]  I also sprinkle some right around the outside where it's going to grow. These beneficial
[19:40.440 --> 19:45.440]  fungus do not work unless they actually touch the roots of the plant. They have to touch
[19:45.440 --> 19:51.080]  the plant. That triggers them to germinate and become alive. They have to come in contact.
[19:51.080 --> 19:53.800]  Sprinkle those powders right onto the roots. I really like that.
[19:53.800 --> 19:56.640]  If you want to stick with liquid and use something similar to the Great White, they
[19:56.640 --> 20:01.940]  make a product called Orca. Orca is very similar to the Great White. They took out two specific
[20:01.940 --> 20:06.400]  beneficial funguses, but I don't think you'll ever notice they're missing. It's just easier
[20:06.400 --> 20:10.600]  to keep them in a liquid solution without that fungus in there.
[20:10.600 --> 20:14.880]  Great White also makes a product called MycoCharm. I spoke earlier that I like Recharge because
[20:14.880 --> 20:19.520]  it's got a product that feeds their beneficials that comes in one package. The folks that
[20:19.520 --> 20:24.680]  make Great White and Orca have put out a product called MycoCharm. That product will
[20:24.680 --> 20:29.100]  feed your beneficials. It also contains other things that will encourage root growth and
[20:29.100 --> 20:34.760]  healthy plants. The folks that make Great White and Orca and MycoCharm also make a time
[20:34.760 --> 20:39.740]  release granule. If I'm working in a large container, I like to start that pot with some
[20:39.740 --> 20:44.320]  of the time release granules already in the soil. I'll mix up a large batch of soil with
[20:44.320 --> 20:48.900]  my amendments, with my perlite, with my persolite, and then I will just pour a big bag of the
[20:48.980 --> 20:53.880]  dried granules from Great White right across the top of that, mix it right in, put that
[20:53.880 --> 20:58.260]  into the pot and plant right into that. The plants go crazy. I feel like giving them plenty
[20:58.260 --> 21:03.160]  of that beneficial bacteria really reduces transplant shock and it really encourages
[21:03.160 --> 21:05.700]  explosive root growth.
[21:05.700 --> 21:12.000]  Another powdered root inoculant I can recommend is the Plus Life from our friends at VegBloom.
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.540]  Many of the commercial grows in Colorado are running VegBloom, so I would encourage them
[21:16.720 --> 21:22.720]  just to add the Plus Life product right along the VegBloom base mix. I have had great success
[21:22.720 --> 21:28.180]  using the VegBloom product line and adding the Plus Life root inoculant powder along
[21:28.180 --> 21:32.700]  with that mix, and I've used that in grows of all different sizes. I've used it in four
[21:32.700 --> 21:37.680]  light grows and I've used it in 400 light grows, and I like the way it works in all
[21:37.680 --> 21:38.680]  conditions.
[21:38.680 --> 21:44.260]  All right, I've got one more product to talk about. Another great liquid microbe product
[21:44.300 --> 21:49.420]  is Mammoth Pea. Mammoth Pea is a great product. One of the great things about Mammoth Pea
[21:49.420 --> 21:54.020]  is it is highly concentrated. Another great thing is you do not have to add anything to
[21:54.020 --> 21:59.140]  feed the microbes. Mammoth Pea uses microbes that can sustain themselves off of the carbon
[21:59.140 --> 22:02.220]  and the breakdown happening within the rhizosphere.
[22:02.220 --> 22:07.380]  So that is a list of great microbe products I would recommend. They vary in application
[22:07.380 --> 22:13.300]  rates, they vary in amount of microbes per container, and they are going to vary widely
[22:13.340 --> 22:19.060]  in prices. Find what works best for you and your garden. Some of you are going to enjoy
[22:19.060 --> 22:23.660]  the dried powdered forms more. Some of you are going to like the liquid forms more. Some
[22:23.660 --> 22:29.620]  of you simply cannot get the overpriced expensive products. Some of you will only buy the overpriced
[22:29.620 --> 22:33.540]  expensive products. I get it. Everybody's got their style. That's why I recommended
[22:33.540 --> 22:38.000]  several products. I have used each of those products. I've had great experience with those
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.260]  products and I feel like I can recommend those products to you with confidence that they
[22:42.260 --> 22:47.100]  are going to work in your garden under just about any type of conditions or any type of
[22:47.100 --> 22:48.100]  environment.
[22:48.100 --> 22:52.100]  Now keep in mind that you may need to feed your microbes. I mentioned earlier that some
[22:52.100 --> 22:56.880]  of the microbes do contain other additives that will feed themselves. I will still encourage
[22:56.880 --> 23:03.380]  you to feed the microbes. The microbes want to eat carbs. The plants want to eat carbs.
[23:03.380 --> 23:08.020]  Add a little bit of carbohydrates. The carbohydrates will give your plants energy and the carbohydrates
[23:08.020 --> 23:13.140]  will feed your microbes. It's a win-win situation. Don't overdose the carbs trying to feed them
[23:13.140 --> 23:17.780]  both. I generally suggest starting off with half of the recommended dose. If you buy a
[23:17.780 --> 23:23.340]  bottle of a carbohydrate product and it says feed 40, I recommend you start off with 20.
[23:23.340 --> 23:27.540]  Pay attention. If the plants seem happy, you don't need to increase the dosage. If you
[23:27.540 --> 23:31.620]  want to, you can increase the dosage until you see the plants react poorly. That's what
[23:31.620 --> 23:35.340]  a lot of growers like to do. Push it as hard as we can and then back off. That's how you
[23:35.340 --> 23:36.980]  learn the limits of a plant.
[23:36.980 --> 23:40.480]  But if you're a newer grower, if you're not super experienced, just feed it half of that
[23:40.480 --> 23:44.860]  recommended dosage and the plants will be receiving that nutrition even if you don't
[23:44.860 --> 23:50.100]  see anything happening. Be careful overdoing it with the carbohydrate product late in flower
[23:50.100 --> 23:54.620]  because it will make your buds burn like a rock. They'll just turn into a charcoal briquette
[23:54.620 --> 23:59.900]  and they won't burn very well if you overdo it with the molasses or a carbohydrate product
[23:59.900 --> 24:00.900]  late in bloom.
[24:00.900 --> 24:05.880]  Now, earlier I mentioned MycoCharm. If you want a quality product to feed your microbes
[24:05.880 --> 24:10.080]  and encourage micro growth and encourage root growth and overall plant health, check
[24:10.080 --> 24:14.760]  out MycoCharm from the same folks that make the Great White product line. Now, when it
[24:14.760 --> 24:20.980]  comes to feeding your microbes, I recommend more frequent, smaller doses. Now, the first
[24:20.980 --> 24:25.840]  time I introduce microbes to my feeding regimen, I usually give it what the bottle says. If
[24:25.840 --> 24:31.760]  the container says one gram or 25 milliliters, I will add that to my nutrient solution and
[24:31.760 --> 24:37.240]  I will water that right in. My goal is to get a good start of a colonization of microbes.
[24:37.240 --> 24:40.840]  I just want to give it a good head start. Just put them in there and get them going.
[24:40.840 --> 24:47.000]  Then my subsequent waterings, I will probably give it half of the recommended dosage, but
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.200]  those products usually say to water it in once a week. Instead of doing it once a week,
[24:52.200 --> 24:57.880]  I'll reduce the dosage to half and water it every time I water for a couple of weeks to
[24:57.880 --> 25:04.240]  build a nice, solid colony of beneficial fungus in my rhizosphere. Now, after I transplant
[25:04.240 --> 25:07.920]  into my three gallon pots and I get the root zone cranking and I've got a nice fat root
[25:07.920 --> 25:14.520]  ball in that pot, I will start reducing my frequency of inoculant feedings. In a commercial
[25:14.520 --> 25:19.660]  grow, when I'm in flower, I generally feed Plus Life once a week and that's enough through
[25:19.660 --> 25:23.640]  the flowering cycle. Once I've got the roots nice and healthy and everything has developed,
[25:23.640 --> 25:28.000]  I will generally use the Plus Life to keep problems away. It keeps the root zone nice
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.960]  and clean, a nice enzymatic product, and a nice mycorrhizal product again will work to
[25:32.960 --> 25:36.640]  keep the roots clean and healthy and happy and pathogen free.
[25:36.640 --> 25:42.280]  So I'll just continue the once a week feeding just to keep everybody clean and happy. It's
[25:42.280 --> 25:46.860]  sort of like plant probiotics. It's like giving probiotics to a plant. If you take probiotics
[25:46.860 --> 25:51.440]  for your gut health, it just has a good, you've got a good gut biome. We're making a good
[25:51.440 --> 25:57.200]  gut biome for our plants by feeding them probiotics, which are actually mycorrhizal
[25:57.200 --> 25:59.200]  fungus when it comes to the plant world.
[25:59.200 --> 26:02.680]  All right, podcast world, I've got one more thing to talk about and then we're going to
[26:02.680 --> 26:08.480]  start wrapping up this episode. When you were listening or reading or learning about mycorrhizal
[26:08.480 --> 26:14.800]  fungus, you will hear three words quite frequently that basically mean the same thing. You will
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.400]  hear the word inoculated, you will hear the word vaccinated, and you will also hear the
[26:19.400 --> 26:25.320]  word infected. These words all basically mean that the root zone shows the presence
[26:25.320 --> 26:31.840]  of a mycorrhizal fungus. We inoculate our root zone with a fungus by adding it ourselves.
[26:31.840 --> 26:36.960]  We have now inoculated it. Once that takes hold, it is basically vaccinated. Once it
[26:36.960 --> 26:41.920]  travels across the root zone, it is infected. That is a positive thing. I know they sound
[26:41.920 --> 26:47.360]  like scary words, but in this situation, all three of those words are positive things that
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.800]  we want happening within our rhizosphere. When you hear the word inoculated, vaccinated,
[26:52.800 --> 26:58.320]  or infected, keep in mind, it just means basically the presence of mycorrhizal fungus within
[26:58.320 --> 26:59.320]  our root zone.
[26:59.320 --> 27:04.000]  All right, podcast world, that is my talk about continuing small, healthy veg plants.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.040]  That is also my lesson on mycorrhizal fungus. I want to thank you guys for listening to
[27:08.040 --> 27:13.080]  this episode. If you are interested in learning a lot more about mycorrhizal fungi, I highly
[27:13.080 --> 27:18.680]  recommend a podcast called Cannabis Cultivation and Sciences by Tad Hussey. Tad recently had
[27:18.680 --> 27:25.000]  Jim Egan on the show, and they do a deep dive into mycorrhizal fungus. I highly recommend
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.160]  the episode. It was great timing. I had already planned this episode to come out this week.
[27:29.160 --> 27:34.000]  I was writing this episode, and then Monday, this episode popped up. It was beautifully
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.600]  timed. You've got a nice introduction from me, and then Tad takes it really deep.
[27:38.600 --> 27:43.160]  If you're going to listen to Tad's podcast, I highly recommend a notebook and a pen. You
[27:43.160 --> 27:48.440]  are going to learn a lot about cultivation. You will learn a lot about organic cultivation.
[27:48.440 --> 27:52.740]  You'll learn about sustainability. You will learn about permaculture, and you will certainly
[27:52.740 --> 27:58.360]  learn about mycorrhizal fungi. Again, the podcast is called Cannabis Cultivation and
[27:58.360 --> 28:04.040]  Sciences, and I highly recommend it if you want to expand your cultivation knowledge.
[28:04.040 --> 28:06.940]  Podcast world, that's all I've got for you for this episode. I want to thank you again
[28:06.940 --> 28:12.180]  for listening. Again, if you feel like this episode was educational, informative, or entertaining,

[29:47.140 --> 29:51.700]  transplanting our small plants into their forever homes. I look forward to that episode.
[29:51.700 --> 29:56.740]  I can't wait to join you there. I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Hot Saucerman.
[29:56.740 --> 29:59.700]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
