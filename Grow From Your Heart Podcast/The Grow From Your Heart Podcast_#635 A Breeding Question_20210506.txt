[00:00.000 --> 00:06.880]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[00:06.880 --> 00:12.740]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 635 of the Grow From Your
[00:12.740 --> 00:13.740]  Heart podcast.
[00:13.740 --> 00:17.340]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on Patreon messages.
[00:17.340 --> 00:21.580]  Before we get there, let's do a few shoutouts to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:21.580 --> 00:26.500]  Of course, the 710 Club are the friends who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:26.500 --> 00:27.780]  level or higher.
[00:27.780 --> 00:31.040]  So with no further ado, let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast
[00:31.040 --> 00:33.960]  thank you shout out to my friend Urban Farmer.
[00:33.960 --> 00:37.660]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Paul Forster and Ivan Munoz.
[00:37.660 --> 00:41.520]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Roll This Nug and Justin Klosser.
[00:41.520 --> 00:44.560]  Let's send a big thank you to Jordan Perks and Stone Trout Bum.
[00:44.560 --> 00:47.200]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Dayron T and Grant Mulkey.
[00:47.200 --> 00:52.000]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to Blackbird 76 and Kanna Organic.
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.580]  Let's follow it up with a shout out to Nicholas A. And then let's wrap it all up with the
[00:55.580 --> 01:01.300]  big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to my friend DZ from Detroit.

[01:30.740 --> 01:34.020]  Alright, I don't have a lot of stuff to ramble about here at the start of the show.
[01:34.020 --> 01:37.280]  I do have one important thing to remind you about.
[01:37.280 --> 01:43.580]  Don't forget about the Groovy Gravy Secret Stash Seed Exchange event happening in Denver
[01:43.580 --> 01:46.920]  May 22nd at an undisclosed secret location.
[01:46.920 --> 01:51.100]  That's right you will be given the exact address and location when the time is appropriate.
[01:51.100 --> 01:53.860]  We're trying to keep that on the down low until the right time.
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.040]  Anyway, make sure you follow the link in the video description.
[01:57.040 --> 02:00.900]  There's a link in the video, the show description that will get you right to the place to get
[02:00.900 --> 02:01.900]  tickets.
[02:01.900 --> 02:06.680]  When you get there to get tickets, use coupon code RASTAJEFF and that will save you 20%
[02:06.680 --> 02:08.080]  on ticket pricing.
[02:08.080 --> 02:10.640]  The VIP tickets are all sold out at this time.
[02:10.640 --> 02:14.240]  A couple of people have messaged me and they said, bro, I want to get in on the event.
[02:14.240 --> 02:15.960]  I want to get VIP tickets.
[02:15.960 --> 02:17.080]  I am just a vendor.
[02:17.080 --> 02:18.080]  I don't run the event.
[02:18.080 --> 02:20.120]  I'm not part of the event staff.
[02:20.120 --> 02:21.120]  I signed up.
[02:21.120 --> 02:22.120]  I paid to be a vendor.
[02:22.120 --> 02:24.220]  I'm basically a guest just like you.
[02:24.220 --> 02:27.400]  So if you want to participate in the event, if you want to buy a ticket, you've got to
[02:27.400 --> 02:30.600]  go through the proper channels, contact Groovy Gravy.
[02:30.600 --> 02:32.380]  You can find them on social media.
[02:32.380 --> 02:33.380]  Look for my post.
[02:33.380 --> 02:34.380]  You can find them.
[02:34.380 --> 02:36.380]  If the tickets are sold out, the tickets are sold out.
[02:36.380 --> 02:37.540]  I can't help you.
[02:37.540 --> 02:38.780]  The VIP tickets are gone.
[02:38.780 --> 02:40.580]  I can't get you VIP tickets.
[02:40.580 --> 02:44.660]  By the time this airs, the regular tickets will be very, very low.
[02:44.660 --> 02:46.280]  So get yourself a ticket now.
[02:46.280 --> 02:47.280]  Come join us in Denver.
[02:47.280 --> 02:48.280]  Hang out.
[02:48.280 --> 02:49.280]  Can't wait to meet you.
[02:49.280 --> 02:50.280]  Get you some sweet seeds.
[02:50.280 --> 02:51.280]  Give you some fresh deals.
[02:51.440 --> 02:57.560]  I look forward to seeing you May 22nd at the Groovy Gravy Secret Stash Seed Exchange event
[02:57.560 --> 03:01.280]  at an undisclosed location in Denver, Colorado.
[03:01.280 --> 03:02.600]  All right.
[03:02.600 --> 03:03.600]  That is enough news.
[03:03.600 --> 03:04.600]  That's enough updates.
[03:04.600 --> 03:06.800]  It's enough bill paying, enough advertising.
[03:06.800 --> 03:09.120]  Let's get into the main portion of this podcast.
[03:09.120 --> 03:12.960]  I do have an email right here in front of me and it comes from a person named Brett
[03:12.960 --> 03:15.760]  E and it goes just like this.
[03:15.760 --> 03:19.600]  It says, Hey, Rasta Jeff, I just signed up for Patreon and I saw your post about the
[03:19.600 --> 03:24.280]  shout outs and that's great, but you can use my IG moniker instead of my real name.
[03:24.280 --> 03:25.280]  That would be great.
[03:25.280 --> 03:29.080]  My IG moniker is no till Luma naughty.
[03:29.080 --> 03:30.160]  So big shout out to our friend.
[03:30.160 --> 03:31.160]  No till Luma naughty.
[03:31.160 --> 03:36.280]  I mentioned it in a previous episode that when you sign up on Patreon, I will give you
[03:36.280 --> 03:39.160]  a shout out under the name you signed up under on Patreon.
[03:39.160 --> 03:40.160]  It's the name I've got.
[03:40.160 --> 03:41.160]  It's what I read on the screen.
[03:41.160 --> 03:42.560]  It's the easiest for me.
[03:42.560 --> 03:45.560]  However, I've realized that some people don't want me to say that name, that they've got
[03:45.560 --> 03:47.800]  another name they'd rather get a shout out through.
[03:47.800 --> 03:50.320]  If you've got that name you want me to say, send it to me.
[03:50.320 --> 03:51.800]  I'll do my best to find that message.
[03:51.800 --> 03:52.800]  I'll flag it.
[03:52.800 --> 03:53.800]  I'll print it out.
[03:53.800 --> 03:54.800]  I'll try to remember.
[03:54.800 --> 03:57.320]  I'll try to correlate that name that I see on the screen to the name that you've sent
[03:57.320 --> 03:58.320]  me.
[03:58.320 --> 03:59.320]  Honestly, it takes a couple of tries.
[03:59.320 --> 04:00.320]  I've got the ADD.
[04:00.320 --> 04:01.320]  I got the brain thing.
[04:01.320 --> 04:04.880]  I also have high as giraffe pussy half the time, so I will do my best to correlate the
[04:04.880 --> 04:07.120]  appropriate name to the appropriate shout out.
[04:07.120 --> 04:09.320]  This person right here had the right approach.
[04:09.320 --> 04:10.520]  Big shout out to our friend.
[04:10.520 --> 04:12.760]  No till Luma naughty.
[04:12.760 --> 04:13.920]  That is their Instagram handle.
[04:13.920 --> 04:17.560]  Give them a follow at no till Luma naughty on the Instagram.
[04:17.600 --> 04:19.640]  Once again, shout out to them and thank you for the support, bro.
[04:19.640 --> 04:21.480]  I want to keep moving.
[04:21.480 --> 04:25.280]  The next message says this one actually came from my website.
[04:25.280 --> 04:28.440]  If you visit my website, I read genetics.com.
[04:28.440 --> 04:31.280]  There's a grow help tab on that website.
[04:31.280 --> 04:32.640]  You can click on grow help.
[04:32.640 --> 04:34.200]  You can send me a message.
[04:34.200 --> 04:39.080]  It does ask you a couple of questions before you get there, but this person basically said,
[04:39.080 --> 04:43.080]  what would you, what cultivar would you recommend for concentrates?
[04:43.080 --> 04:44.080]  That's a very good question.
[04:44.080 --> 04:45.800]  Uh, let me back up.
[04:45.800 --> 04:46.880]  I am a podcaster.
[04:47.200 --> 04:48.960]  Of course, you know me as the grow from your heart podcast.
[04:48.960 --> 04:52.360]  I'm also the sole proprietor, sole breeder.
[04:52.360 --> 04:56.480]  I'm the guy from I read genetics premium seed, so I also make a lot of seeds.
[04:56.480 --> 04:58.120]  That's what this question comes from.
[04:58.120 --> 05:01.200]  Just because not everybody knows that all the stuff that I do.
[05:01.200 --> 05:04.880]  So they're asking about some of the strains that I breed from I read genetics.
[05:04.880 --> 05:07.280]  What cultivar would you recommend for concentrates?
[05:07.280 --> 05:08.640]  That is a very good question.
[05:08.640 --> 05:12.240]  I really like talking about my concentrates, about my strains, about my cultivars, about
[05:12.240 --> 05:13.240]  my breeding.
[05:13.240 --> 05:14.320]  So this will get me going.
[05:14.320 --> 05:15.760]  I really like this one.
[05:15.800 --> 05:17.400]  I've got a lot of answers for this question.
[05:17.400 --> 05:20.320]  It kind of depends on what kind of concentrates you want to make.
[05:20.320 --> 05:21.960]  Do you want to make a bubble hash?
[05:21.960 --> 05:23.600]  Do you want to make BHO?
[05:23.600 --> 05:24.680]  Are you squishing stuff?
[05:24.680 --> 05:25.680]  How are you doing it?
[05:25.680 --> 05:27.440]  That's going to kind of make a difference here.
[05:27.440 --> 05:33.040]  What I've noticed is the strawberry starburst always makes super tasty, delicious, high
[05:33.040 --> 05:34.840]  potency concentrates.
[05:34.840 --> 05:39.720]  No matter how you run it, how you press it, squish it, wash it, extract it, blast it,
[05:39.720 --> 05:41.640]  process it, whatever you want to call it.
[05:41.640 --> 05:44.880]  Strawberry starburst will make amazing concentrates.
[05:44.920 --> 05:46.560]  I am not a big fan of rosin.
[05:46.560 --> 05:47.920]  I don't like to smoke rosin.
[05:47.920 --> 05:51.360]  Most of the time, and I'm not a hater, this is my honest opinion.
[05:51.360 --> 05:53.040]  I love a lot of things.
[05:53.040 --> 05:54.040]  Rosin is not for me.
[05:54.040 --> 05:58.400]  It tastes like burnt popcorn and popsicle sticks, and that's not the terp for me.
[05:58.400 --> 06:00.240]  So a lot of people love rosin.
[06:00.240 --> 06:01.840]  A lot of people love BHO.
[06:01.840 --> 06:04.920]  A lot of people love different types of stuff.
[06:04.920 --> 06:06.560]  If you are making...
[06:06.560 --> 06:07.560]  So where was I?
[06:07.560 --> 06:08.960]  I remember what I was saying now.
[06:08.960 --> 06:10.240]  I'm not a big fan of rosin.
[06:10.240 --> 06:12.160]  I got myself back on track.
[06:12.200 --> 06:17.640]  My friend Pedro made some rosin from some strawberry starburst, and that rosin was some
[06:17.640 --> 06:22.200]  of the most delicious and potent concentrate I have ever inhaled and exhaled.
[06:22.200 --> 06:27.200]  On the inhale, it tastes like sweet candy, like almost those watermelon candies or strawberry
[06:27.200 --> 06:30.600]  candies that grandma used to have in a candy dish on the table that got dusty and shit,
[06:30.600 --> 06:31.920]  but they still tasted good.
[06:31.920 --> 06:34.120]  It tasted like that on the inhale.
[06:34.120 --> 06:38.840]  Then on the exhale, it was like sweet bubble gum and kush, and it just stayed on my tongue,
[06:38.840 --> 06:39.840]  and I was high as shit.
[06:39.840 --> 06:40.840]  My eyes got heavy.
[06:40.840 --> 06:42.200]  My lungs felt heavy from it.
[06:42.200 --> 06:45.320]  So that was a Pedro dab of strawberry starburst rosin.
[06:45.320 --> 06:47.300]  I bred the strawberry starburst.
[06:47.300 --> 06:52.040]  Our buddy Kelvin Medina actually grew the flowers, and then Pedro from Pedro's Grow
[06:52.040 --> 06:55.960]  Room did the extraction, and it was delicious.
[06:55.960 --> 07:00.680]  So the strawberry starburst is one of the best for any kind of concentrates, in my opinion.
[07:00.680 --> 07:04.800]  Then I also feel the same way about the blue raspberry truffle.
[07:04.800 --> 07:08.360]  The blue raspberry truffle makes amazing BHO concentrates.
[07:08.360 --> 07:12.960]  If you're making anything using a solvent extract or a solvent extraction, that blue
[07:12.960 --> 07:17.000]  raspberry truffle will dump resin, and it tastes so crazy.
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.700]  The concentrates and the turps are just ridiculous.
[07:19.700 --> 07:28.800]  It's like blue raspberry candy, blue raspberry suckers, tropical Skittles, sour flavors.
[07:28.800 --> 07:30.220]  There's just tart flavors in there.
[07:30.220 --> 07:31.220]  There's cherry.
[07:31.220 --> 07:32.220]  There's blueberry.
[07:32.220 --> 07:33.640]  There's all kinds of funky shit in there.
[07:33.640 --> 07:35.640]  It's got some just razzy stuff going on.
[07:35.640 --> 07:36.640]  It's really delicious.
[07:37.200 --> 07:41.440]  Then there's another one I talk about all the time when it comes to concentrates.
[07:41.440 --> 07:45.320]  One of my favorites for concentrates is the cream.
[07:45.320 --> 07:47.760]  The cream makes really great bubble hash.
[07:47.760 --> 07:50.080]  The cream makes really good press hash.
[07:50.080 --> 07:53.440]  If you make bubble and then press it, it is tremendous.
[07:53.440 --> 07:55.840]  It comes out white and beach sandy.
[07:55.840 --> 07:57.680]  There's something about ... I'm not a concentrate maker.
[07:57.680 --> 07:58.840]  I've said this before.
[07:58.840 --> 08:00.120]  I enjoy concentrates.
[08:00.120 --> 08:02.920]  I have experimented and attempted to make concentrates.
[08:02.920 --> 08:05.920]  I'm better at fucking up a concentrate than I am at making them.
[08:05.920 --> 08:09.440]  I'm much better at smoking a concentrate than I am at making them.
[08:09.440 --> 08:11.280]  I let the concentrate makers do that.
[08:11.280 --> 08:14.560]  I focus on breeding, podcasting, growing, other things.
[08:14.560 --> 08:16.520]  I feel like I've got my niche.
[08:16.520 --> 08:21.800]  I don't know a lot about the science of extracting, but I know there are different size and shape
[08:21.800 --> 08:24.480]  trichomes on plants.
[08:24.480 --> 08:29.360]  I know that the strawberry starburst and blue raspberry truffle make tall trichomes with
[08:29.360 --> 08:30.880]  a big fat head.
[08:30.880 --> 08:33.920]  That is something I've seen, something I've seen under a microscope, something people
[08:33.920 --> 08:35.840]  have noticed and shown to me.
[08:35.840 --> 08:38.320]  The opposite of that happens with the cream.
[08:38.320 --> 08:44.520]  Those are short and bulky, almost like stocky, fat boy kind of bowling pin shaped trichomes.
[08:44.520 --> 08:48.360]  They're shorter and closer to the plant, and they're wider and more bulbous on the top,
[08:48.360 --> 08:49.940]  and they have a fatter head.
[08:49.940 --> 08:53.440]  For some reason, that seems to make a better bubble hash product.
[08:53.440 --> 08:54.440]  I don't know.
[08:54.440 --> 08:55.960]  Again, I'm not the concentrate maker.
[08:55.960 --> 09:00.600]  I don't know your end of the job, but I can tell the two trichome size differences, shape
[09:00.600 --> 09:01.640]  differences.
[09:01.640 --> 09:06.120]  The two strains I mentioned at the first have the longer, skinnier, taller trichomes, and
[09:06.120 --> 09:09.680]  the short have shorter, fatter trichomes, and they make completely different kinds of
[09:09.680 --> 09:10.680]  concentrates.
[09:10.680 --> 09:14.440]  You'll get an oily texture out of some and a sandy texture out of others.
[09:14.440 --> 09:20.120]  I think that the cream makes a beach sand, a gritty baby powder sort of a texture when
[09:20.120 --> 09:23.640]  it comes to making concentrates, and it's so beautiful.
[09:23.640 --> 09:26.960]  My top three that I would recommend would be the blue raspberry truffle, the strawberry
[09:26.960 --> 09:29.440]  starburst, and the cream.
[09:29.440 --> 09:34.080]  With that being said, the blueberry butcher that I just put out, I said blueberry butcher.
[09:34.080 --> 09:39.720]  The blueberry butcher that I just put out also dumps and makes all kinds of amazing
[09:39.720 --> 09:40.720]  concentrates.
[09:40.720 --> 09:46.200]  I breed for that high THC stuff because I like to get so high that I almost can't function.
[09:46.200 --> 09:48.700]  I try to give myself a panic attack.
[09:48.700 --> 09:52.920]  If I walk into the mall and I'm okay, I didn't get high enough.
[09:52.920 --> 09:55.640]  I got to walk into the mall and be like, fuck, I can't be here.
[09:55.640 --> 09:57.280]  That's the way my dabs should make me feel.
[09:57.280 --> 10:03.040]  I breed for that high intensity panic attack, fucking head buzz, head ringing, fucking crazy
[10:03.040 --> 10:06.560]  high that you've got your eyes dart around the room and your heart beats out of your
[10:06.560 --> 10:07.560]  chest.
[10:07.560 --> 10:08.560]  I love that.
[10:08.560 --> 10:10.520]  But I'm also breeding for intense flavor.
[10:10.520 --> 10:12.400]  I love good tasting weed.
[10:12.400 --> 10:13.880]  Weed should taste good.
[10:13.880 --> 10:15.560]  Concentrates should taste even better.
[10:15.560 --> 10:19.760]  So I'm breeding basically for perfect concentrate plants.
[10:19.760 --> 10:21.040]  I love to smoke concentrates.
[10:21.040 --> 10:23.440]  I grow my plants and they're extracted immediately.
[10:23.440 --> 10:28.200]  In fact, today I got to smoke some concentrate made from a plant that I bred and that a friend
[10:28.200 --> 10:29.800]  grew who'd rather remain anonymous.
[10:29.800 --> 10:33.600]  But bro, you know who you are and those concentrates were fucking delicious.
[10:33.600 --> 10:34.600]  Thank you, bro.
[10:34.600 --> 10:37.800]  So yeah, I grow my stuff with concentrate production in mind.
[10:37.800 --> 10:41.360]  I breed with concentrate production in mind because that's what I prefer.
[10:41.360 --> 10:44.960]  I like to smoke flower, but dabbing is where it's at for me.
[10:44.960 --> 10:46.360]  I'm a busy guy.
[10:46.360 --> 10:49.560]  Also been smoking for fucking 25 years at least now.
[10:49.560 --> 10:51.360]  So my tolerance is off the charts.
[10:51.360 --> 10:53.480]  I got to smoke a pound of weed to get a nice buzz.
[10:53.480 --> 10:56.120]  I could take six dabs and be fucking wrecked if I do it right.
[10:56.120 --> 10:57.960]  So I really like dabbing.
[10:57.960 --> 11:00.080]  I got myself way far off track here.
[11:00.080 --> 11:01.520]  What would I recommend for concentrates?
[11:01.520 --> 11:05.280]  Again, the cream, strawberry starburst, blue raspberry truffle.
[11:05.280 --> 11:08.400]  And if you can get your hands on it, that blueberry butcher is a great one.
[11:08.400 --> 11:10.520]  You can find the blueberry butcher at seedsherenow.com.
[11:10.520 --> 11:13.120]  Make sure that you use coupon code GFYH10.
[11:13.120 --> 11:16.160]  That'll save you 10% on your full order.
[11:16.160 --> 11:17.800]  Sneaky commercial right in there.
[11:17.800 --> 11:19.720]  All right, I'm going to move on.
[11:19.720 --> 11:20.920]  This one does come from Patreon.
[11:21.120 --> 11:23.560]  Hey, thank you for the question about the cultivar also.
[11:23.560 --> 11:24.560]  That's a great question.
[11:24.560 --> 11:27.160]  And when you do get seeds, I want to know how it runs for you.
[11:27.160 --> 11:29.200]  And I want to know how the concentrates come out.
[11:29.200 --> 11:30.760]  Let me know what strain you choose.
[11:30.760 --> 11:32.280]  Let me know how you extracted it.
[11:32.280 --> 11:35.280]  Let me know if you were satisfied with my recommendations.
[11:35.280 --> 11:36.600]  And then I'll get you my address.
[11:36.600 --> 11:38.440]  You can fill me up with some concentrates.
[11:38.440 --> 11:39.520]  All right, let's keep moving.
[11:39.520 --> 11:40.800]  This one does come from Patreon.
[11:40.800 --> 11:42.360]  It says, what up, Ross to Jeff.
[11:42.360 --> 11:46.560]  I've been listening to your podcast for over two years since I started my grow journey.
[11:46.560 --> 11:49.040]  I wanted to say thank you for the motivation
[11:49.040 --> 11:52.040]  and the knowledge you gave me to continue to give countless,
[11:52.040 --> 11:56.120]  oh, that you gave me and you continue to give countless new growers.
[11:56.120 --> 11:58.320]  That's a great way to start a message.
[11:58.320 --> 11:59.480]  You've been listening for two years,
[11:59.480 --> 12:01.760]  which thank you for following along for so long.
[12:01.760 --> 12:04.320]  I'm glad I didn't annoy you and run you off.
[12:04.320 --> 12:05.560]  Thanks for the motivation, bro.
[12:05.560 --> 12:07.000]  Thank you for the motivation.
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.480]  This is a two-way street.
[12:08.480 --> 12:09.640]  I put out content.
[12:09.640 --> 12:10.400]  You listen to it.
[12:10.400 --> 12:12.320]  You say thank you and motivate me.
[12:12.320 --> 12:13.920]  I know your garden's getting better.
[12:13.920 --> 12:14.840]  It is a two-way street.
[12:14.880 --> 12:17.080]  So thank you for the motivation.
[12:17.080 --> 12:19.280]  This is a good relationship.
[12:19.280 --> 12:20.440]  And knowledge.
[12:20.440 --> 12:21.280]  I've said it before.
[12:21.280 --> 12:23.200]  I've got this knowledge in my head.
[12:23.200 --> 12:24.880]  I was blessed by what created me.
[12:24.880 --> 12:26.440]  You guys know I believe in Rastafari.
[12:26.440 --> 12:28.160]  So Jah gave me this knowledge.
[12:28.160 --> 12:29.680]  And if I didn't share it,
[12:29.680 --> 12:33.560]  I would be disrespectful to myself, to Jah, and to you.
[12:33.560 --> 12:34.600]  Like I was given a gift.
[12:34.600 --> 12:35.840]  I've got this gift of gab.
[12:35.840 --> 12:38.320]  I've got this gift of learning, of teaching,
[12:38.320 --> 12:39.920]  this obvious gift of a green thumb.
[12:39.920 --> 12:42.160]  And I enjoy cannabis with a passion.
[12:42.160 --> 12:44.800]  If I didn't put this back out, something would go wrong.
[12:45.560 --> 12:46.560]  I would spontaneously combust.
[12:46.560 --> 12:48.480]  Jah would say, you're being selfish with your gifts
[12:48.480 --> 12:50.480]  and strike me down in some way.
[12:50.480 --> 12:52.360]  Thunder, lightning, brimstone, all that good stuff.
[12:52.360 --> 12:54.920]  So I just try to share the gift I was given.
[12:54.920 --> 12:57.440]  It's in me and it would be selfish
[12:57.440 --> 12:58.480]  not to put it back out there.
[12:58.480 --> 12:59.320]  And it feels good.
[12:59.320 --> 13:01.480]  It's very rewarding.
[13:01.480 --> 13:03.040]  I get to teach you how to grow.
[13:03.040 --> 13:04.200]  And then you say thank you.
[13:04.200 --> 13:06.240]  And then you guys send me money on Patreon.
[13:06.240 --> 13:07.720]  Like it's fucking tremendous.
[13:07.720 --> 13:08.560]  I love it.
[13:08.560 --> 13:09.600]  It's a really good relationship.
[13:09.600 --> 13:11.600]  It's a really good, I'm grateful for it.
[13:11.600 --> 13:12.440]  It feels good.
[13:12.440 --> 13:13.480]  It doesn't feel dirty.
[13:13.480 --> 13:14.320]  I've had jobs.
[13:14.840 --> 13:15.760]  I've done things where I've walked away
[13:15.760 --> 13:16.600]  and been like, yeah, I got paid,
[13:16.600 --> 13:19.120]  but kind of feel like a piece of shit inside for that.
[13:19.120 --> 13:20.640]  I don't feel like a piece of shit when I do this.
[13:20.640 --> 13:21.520]  This feels good.
[13:21.520 --> 13:22.480]  This feels right.
[13:22.480 --> 13:24.080]  I know this is where I'm supposed to be.
[13:24.080 --> 13:26.600]  So big up, big thanks for noticing Rastafari.
[13:26.600 --> 13:28.600]  Let's get myself back on track.
[13:28.600 --> 13:31.080]  Oh, and that I can, countless new growers.
[13:31.080 --> 13:33.880]  I love knowing that I'm helping countless new growers.
[13:33.880 --> 13:35.200]  Every fucking couple of months,
[13:35.200 --> 13:36.840]  we get a new state legalized
[13:36.840 --> 13:38.840]  and that's a full state population
[13:38.840 --> 13:40.200]  of new potential growers.
[13:40.200 --> 13:41.720]  And I'm down to help every one of them.
[13:41.720 --> 13:43.080]  And I love it.
[13:43.080 --> 13:47.040]  So now it says, where were we?
[13:47.040 --> 13:49.160]  You're genuinely helping people.
[13:49.160 --> 13:50.600]  And I fully support that.
[13:50.600 --> 13:51.720]  If it wouldn't be too much,
[13:51.720 --> 13:54.560]  it would be cool if you could shout out my YouTube channel,
[13:54.560 --> 13:55.840]  Rasta Green Thumb,
[13:55.840 --> 13:58.640]  as I basically make videos off of your teachings
[13:58.640 --> 14:00.520]  started last year due to the pandemic.
[14:00.520 --> 14:03.080]  My new life mission is to get this valuable knowledge
[14:03.080 --> 14:04.680]  to as many people as I can,
[14:04.680 --> 14:07.280]  and particularly the minority community
[14:07.280 --> 14:10.520]  who's been oppressed heavily from bullshit cannabis laws.
[14:10.520 --> 14:11.960]  I respect that.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.680]  I love being a white Rastafarian.
[14:13.680 --> 14:15.560]  I've got a lot of friends of different colors
[14:15.560 --> 14:16.840]  from different places.
[14:16.840 --> 14:17.840]  Just being an American person,
[14:17.840 --> 14:19.880]  being a Rasta man has nothing to do with that, I guess.
[14:19.880 --> 14:22.520]  I love people from all different colors, cultures.
[14:22.520 --> 14:23.480]  I love accents.
[14:23.480 --> 14:25.920]  I love fucking vibes from everywhere.
[14:25.920 --> 14:28.160]  Man, if we didn't have people from other places,
[14:28.160 --> 14:29.760]  this country would be boring as fuck.
[14:29.760 --> 14:32.680]  If it was just all one color people or one type of people,
[14:32.680 --> 14:33.520]  this shit would suck.
[14:33.520 --> 14:36.680]  So I appreciate what you're doing for minorities
[14:36.680 --> 14:37.760]  and trying to help people out
[14:37.760 --> 14:41.040]  and get to them who've been oppressed heavily
[14:41.040 --> 14:42.200]  from bullshit cannabis laws.
[14:42.200 --> 14:43.680]  I agree with that.
[14:43.680 --> 14:45.560]  And so thank you for doing what you can for that.
[14:45.560 --> 14:48.240]  And he said, you're kind of just spreading my teachings.
[14:48.240 --> 14:49.160]  Give me some shout outs, bro.
[14:49.160 --> 14:50.080]  Let them know where you learned it
[14:50.080 --> 14:51.000]  and that everything is cool.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.520]  As long as you acknowledge your source,
[14:53.520 --> 14:54.600]  give your teachers some credit,
[14:54.600 --> 14:56.640]  you can share my knowledge all you would like.
[14:56.640 --> 14:58.760]  Let them know to listen to my show as well as yours.
[14:58.760 --> 14:59.640]  I'll give you a shout out.
[14:59.640 --> 15:00.500]  You give me a shout out.
[15:00.500 --> 15:02.160]  You've been following for a long time.
[15:02.160 --> 15:03.640]  Shout out to my buddy Rasta Green Thumb.
[15:03.640 --> 15:05.560]  Check him out on the YouTube channel.
[15:05.560 --> 15:08.580]  It does follow up with, I've got an actual question.
[15:08.580 --> 15:10.520]  It says, when it comes to breeding,
[15:10.520 --> 15:13.240]  if you were to breed with the strains you've already made,
[15:13.240 --> 15:15.720]  which ones do you think would make something amazing
[15:15.720 --> 15:19.600]  if combined, such as Raphael and Orangegasm
[15:19.600 --> 15:21.800]  making a strawberry orange kind of terp?
[15:21.800 --> 15:23.680]  And then it says, I plan to breed seeds in the future
[15:23.680 --> 15:26.320]  and I want to use your high standards of testing them
[15:26.320 --> 15:28.000]  as well as picking good parents.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.080]  Also, would you be opposed to me making S1s
[15:31.080 --> 15:33.480]  of some of your strains and giving them to people
[15:33.480 --> 15:36.560]  in my personal discord that need help getting seeds?
[15:37.680 --> 15:39.780]  I want to touch on the making S1s of my stuff
[15:39.780 --> 15:41.500]  before we talk about your breeding.
[15:41.500 --> 15:43.900]  And then I'll remember to dust this microphone off
[15:43.900 --> 15:44.860]  before I record another show.
[15:44.860 --> 15:45.860]  That thing's dirty and embarrassing.
[15:45.860 --> 15:46.700]  I'm sorry.
[15:47.980 --> 15:50.100]  It is cool with me if you make S1s
[15:50.100 --> 15:52.300]  to give to your friends in need
[15:52.300 --> 15:57.300]  that can't like afford seeds, acquire seeds and get seeds.
[15:57.420 --> 16:00.260]  When you become, when it becomes a bad idea
[16:00.260 --> 16:03.700]  is when you're stepping on my toes, stealing customers,
[16:03.700 --> 16:05.140]  just kind of fucking with me.
[16:05.140 --> 16:06.840]  So if you're going to make these seeds
[16:06.840 --> 16:08.600]  and give them to people who are in need,
[16:08.600 --> 16:10.200]  that is respectable.
[16:10.200 --> 16:13.240]  You've got my permission and my respect for that.
[16:13.240 --> 16:15.840]  Don't cross the line and sell those seeds
[16:15.840 --> 16:19.000]  and make S1s of something that I am putting out
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.160]  and then try to piggyback off of that shit
[16:21.160 --> 16:22.300]  and make a dollar off of it.
[16:22.300 --> 16:23.440]  That's a dick move.
[16:23.440 --> 16:25.160]  It sounds like what you're trying to do is totally cool.
[16:25.160 --> 16:26.080]  You're trying to help people.
[16:26.080 --> 16:27.480]  I want you to help people.
[16:27.480 --> 16:30.080]  If my strains become S1s and help people,
[16:30.080 --> 16:32.480]  that is improving people's quality of life,
[16:32.480 --> 16:35.680]  making people's lives better, letting you help people,
[16:35.680 --> 16:36.640]  you do that.
[16:36.680 --> 16:38.800]  But don't be a dick move and put them on the market
[16:38.800 --> 16:41.840]  and sell them as Lemon Jeffrey S1s or something.
[16:41.840 --> 16:43.100]  That's just being a dick move
[16:43.100 --> 16:44.640]  and it's not gonna work for you anyway,
[16:44.640 --> 16:48.140]  but still in the community and the seed breeding realm,
[16:48.140 --> 16:49.840]  that's where the borderline is.
[16:49.840 --> 16:51.360]  If you're gonna give them away, I'm cool with that.
[16:51.360 --> 16:54.320]  Give them away, but don't go making money
[16:54.320 --> 16:56.640]  off of my creations, which I know that sounds weird
[16:56.640 --> 16:58.060]  because you're like, bro, you just make seeds
[16:58.060 --> 16:59.160]  off of other people's strains.
[16:59.160 --> 17:01.880]  Yes, I do some work with it, but I've done my own research.
[17:01.880 --> 17:02.800]  I've developed my strains.
[17:02.800 --> 17:03.620]  I found parents.
[17:03.620 --> 17:04.460]  I made them.
[17:04.460 --> 17:05.360]  You're just making photocopies.
[17:05.360 --> 17:07.000]  There's already somebody out there doing that.
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.040]  Don't be that guy.
[17:08.040 --> 17:09.400]  All right, I know you're not gonna do that.
[17:09.400 --> 17:10.540]  I just had to make that disclaimer.
[17:10.540 --> 17:11.380]  I love you, bro.
[17:11.380 --> 17:12.840]  No worries on that.
[17:12.840 --> 17:14.120]  So if you're gonna make S1s
[17:14.120 --> 17:15.940]  and give them away to people in need, that is cool.
[17:15.940 --> 17:18.960]  Don't make S1s and then profit off of my work
[17:18.960 --> 17:20.560]  that you're just piggybacking on.
[17:20.560 --> 17:21.480]  That's a dickhead move.
[17:21.480 --> 17:23.480]  I know you're not gonna do that because you say,
[17:23.480 --> 17:24.320]  take care, brother.
[17:24.320 --> 17:27.000]  May Jop provide you with many more blessings and bless up.
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.880]  That shows me your respectful Rasta man.
[17:28.880 --> 17:29.820]  You're not gonna do that to me.
[17:29.820 --> 17:32.440]  Now let's talk about the main part of your question here.
[17:32.440 --> 17:33.680]  When it comes to breeding,
[17:33.680 --> 17:35.720]  if I were to breed with strains I've already made,
[17:35.720 --> 17:39.280]  which strains do you think would make something amazing?
[17:39.280 --> 17:41.960]  And then you ask about Raphael and Orangegasm
[17:41.960 --> 17:44.960]  making orange strawberry kind of turps.
[17:44.960 --> 17:46.960]  That sounds great, but honestly,
[17:46.960 --> 17:49.800]  it sounds like it's so many sweet and tropical things
[17:49.800 --> 17:51.780]  are gonna cancel each other out and it's gonna be weird.
[17:51.780 --> 17:54.040]  And there's already a lot of stuff already like that.
[17:54.040 --> 17:55.920]  Honestly, that's already been done.
[17:55.920 --> 17:57.180]  That's tangy.
[17:57.180 --> 17:59.480]  That's all the tangy crosses.
[17:59.480 --> 18:00.560]  That's tangy, banangy.
[18:00.560 --> 18:02.960]  That's strawberry, banana, tangy.
[18:02.960 --> 18:04.700]  That's already been done.
[18:04.700 --> 18:05.880]  The tangy.
[18:05.880 --> 18:06.920]  So let's talk about that.
[18:06.920 --> 18:08.400]  We could go back in time here.
[18:08.400 --> 18:11.160]  So you've gotta be careful not to bottleneck yourself
[18:11.160 --> 18:12.000]  when you are breeding.
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.960]  And if I know the family history,
[18:13.960 --> 18:16.480]  the family trees of these two strains,
[18:16.480 --> 18:20.700]  Raphael is a blueberry cookies to strawberry fields.
[18:20.700 --> 18:22.600]  Strawberry fields comes from Crockett.
[18:23.480 --> 18:26.740]  Orangegasm is golden goat to platinum tangy.
[18:26.740 --> 18:30.320]  Platinum tangy is platinum cookies to tangy.
[18:30.320 --> 18:33.040]  Tangy is back over here in Crockett's camp.
[18:33.040 --> 18:36.040]  I would have to carefully research the strawberry fields
[18:36.040 --> 18:38.760]  and the tangy and see if they have similar parents
[18:38.760 --> 18:41.560]  because if so, it's already been done.
[18:41.560 --> 18:43.480]  That cross is kinda, do you see what I'm saying?
[18:43.480 --> 18:45.860]  Like they already, if Crockett owns both those parents,
[18:45.860 --> 18:47.520]  he's probably already done that cross.
[18:47.520 --> 18:49.280]  There's no need for me to do it.
[18:49.280 --> 18:52.960]  Also, if I'm gonna breed, so if I use that strawberry,
[18:52.960 --> 18:57.020]  there's a strawberry fields in there and the tangy in there,
[18:57.020 --> 18:58.720]  they probably already have a parent in there.
[18:58.720 --> 18:59.920]  I don't wanna breed with something
[18:59.920 --> 19:01.420]  that's got a similar parent.
[19:01.420 --> 19:02.500]  That's not gonna do me any good.
[19:02.500 --> 19:04.480]  That's going backwards.
[19:04.480 --> 19:06.160]  So just with a little bit of quick thinking
[19:06.160 --> 19:08.280]  about my family tree,
[19:08.280 --> 19:10.200]  Raphael to Orangegasm would just basically
[19:10.200 --> 19:12.280]  be remaking some Crockett shit.
[19:12.280 --> 19:15.560]  And I need to stay further away from that to be original.
[19:15.560 --> 19:17.360]  I don't wanna rewrite Stairway to Heaven.
[19:17.360 --> 19:19.000]  Fucking Zeppelin already did that.
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.720]  So I need to use the same chords and play it differently
[19:21.720 --> 19:23.720]  or fucking not play those chords at all.
[19:23.720 --> 19:26.440]  Like I just don't wanna recreate something that Crockett did
[19:26.440 --> 19:28.280]  or something so close to Crockett's camp.
[19:28.840 --> 19:30.480]  And I know you probably didn't even realize
[19:30.480 --> 19:32.280]  that there was strawberry fields in there
[19:32.280 --> 19:34.000]  that's from Crockett and there's tangy in there
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.160]  that's from Crockett.
[19:35.160 --> 19:36.900]  And now we're just playing with two of Crockett's things
[19:36.900 --> 19:38.080]  all over again.
[19:38.080 --> 19:40.840]  And as a respectable breeder, that's Crockett stuff.
[19:40.840 --> 19:42.680]  If anyone's gonna cross those two, it should be Crockett.
[19:42.680 --> 19:44.080]  I don't need to go backwards.
[19:44.080 --> 19:46.860]  So that is why I wouldn't cross those.
[19:46.860 --> 19:48.980]  And you gotta be careful about bottlenecking yourself.
[19:48.980 --> 19:50.880]  If there's a similar parent, which I'm sure there is,
[19:50.880 --> 19:52.280]  I didn't research that,
[19:52.280 --> 19:53.600]  but I'm sure there's a similar parent
[19:53.600 --> 19:55.640]  between the tangy and the strawberry fields,
[19:55.640 --> 19:58.480]  probably a tangy something, probably that orange.
[19:58.480 --> 20:01.440]  Calio is probably in there somewhere on both of them.
[20:01.440 --> 20:02.480]  So I wouldn't wanna do that
[20:02.480 --> 20:04.560]  because then I'm just breeding back to that same parent.
[20:04.560 --> 20:07.080]  That Calio that is common in those two
[20:07.080 --> 20:08.800]  is gonna come out again.
[20:08.800 --> 20:10.480]  It's just not something that would interest me.
[20:10.480 --> 20:13.540]  So then that's something as a breeder,
[20:13.540 --> 20:15.000]  I have to be careful about.
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.420]  Everything is pollinated by King Solomon.
[20:17.420 --> 20:20.120]  So if I wanna breed strawberry starburst to anything,
[20:20.120 --> 20:20.960]  it can't be blue.
[20:20.960 --> 20:22.440]  It could be, but it's not a good idea.
[20:22.440 --> 20:23.360]  I'm going backwards.
[20:23.360 --> 20:26.080]  Again, I'm kind of inbreeding, cousin fucking.
[20:26.080 --> 20:27.560]  That's never a good idea.
[20:27.560 --> 20:30.920]  So I would do strawberry starburst.
[20:30.920 --> 20:32.000]  I'm trying to keep my brain straight here.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.440]  Strawberry starburst to blue raspberry truffle
[20:34.440 --> 20:35.920]  would have two arise parents in there.
[20:35.920 --> 20:38.200]  We're gonna get a lot of arise traits.
[20:38.200 --> 20:40.200]  Strawberry starburst to sunkiss.
[20:40.200 --> 20:41.840]  We got arise traits in there.
[20:41.840 --> 20:43.760]  So I've gotta be careful not to breed that back
[20:43.760 --> 20:45.880]  to anything that's been done to arise.
[20:45.880 --> 20:48.980]  So then I would look to my blueberry cookies line
[20:48.980 --> 20:50.780]  or my grateful dog line
[20:50.780 --> 20:53.040]  and breed it to something else that I have bred.
[20:53.720 --> 20:55.200]  Here's a good example of some strains I've crossed together
[20:55.200 --> 20:56.800]  that have been strains I've created
[20:56.800 --> 20:58.480]  that I've crossed together.
[20:58.480 --> 21:01.600]  The grateful dog is an inbred feminized project.
[21:01.600 --> 21:03.320]  I'm not gonna talk too much about the history of that.
[21:03.320 --> 21:04.940]  You guys know about that already.
[21:04.940 --> 21:05.960]  I've got the grateful dog.
[21:05.960 --> 21:06.780]  That is my plant.
[21:06.780 --> 21:08.320]  Femme seed, female only.
[21:08.320 --> 21:11.200]  I've got the keeper, the prize, the winner of that.
[21:11.200 --> 21:12.700]  Then I also made the arise,
[21:12.700 --> 21:15.480]  which is golden goat crossed to daybreaker.
[21:15.480 --> 21:17.400]  Then I took the golden goat and daybreaker,
[21:17.400 --> 21:18.480]  found a male out of that.
[21:18.480 --> 21:19.760]  That's King Solomon.
[21:19.760 --> 21:21.740]  I pollinated that grateful dog
[21:21.740 --> 21:23.260]  and that makes my morning dew.
[21:23.260 --> 21:27.100]  So that is my child, my child, and my grandchildren
[21:27.100 --> 21:29.620]  basically crossing there making stuff.
[21:29.620 --> 21:31.420]  So that's when I'm able to cross stuff
[21:31.420 --> 21:33.060]  is when I open it up and do things
[21:33.060 --> 21:34.300]  that aren't all King Solomon
[21:34.300 --> 21:35.540]  or all the Jack the Ripper male
[21:35.540 --> 21:37.180]  or all the grateful dog male.
[21:37.180 --> 21:41.180]  Now you wanna know what would be something amazing,
[21:41.180 --> 21:42.740]  something else you think I would be,
[21:42.740 --> 21:45.400]  something else you think I could make that would be amazing.
[21:45.400 --> 21:48.340]  The Jack the Ripper crosses I just made are amazing.
[21:48.340 --> 21:51.380]  I do plan on finding some males in that line
[21:52.020 --> 21:53.180]  to go back to some of my females.
[21:53.180 --> 21:55.700]  So there will be some Jack the Ripper crosses
[21:55.700 --> 21:57.140]  to arise crosses,
[21:57.140 --> 21:59.880]  Jack the Ripper crosses to blueberry cookies crosses.
[21:59.880 --> 22:01.700]  Some of those things will go back.
[22:03.200 --> 22:04.980]  Some of the feminized only stuff
[22:04.980 --> 22:07.980]  to more feminized only stuff will be fun also.
[22:07.980 --> 22:08.860]  So when it comes to breeding,
[22:08.860 --> 22:11.020]  if I were to breed with the strains I've already made,
[22:11.020 --> 22:13.800]  which ones do I think would make something amazing?
[22:13.800 --> 22:16.320]  Grateful dog to arise, that made morning dew.
[22:17.460 --> 22:18.340]  What else could we talk about?
[22:18.980 --> 22:22.300]  Lemon Jeffrey to the arise made lemon sunrise.
[22:22.300 --> 22:23.180]  I made both of those.
[22:23.180 --> 22:24.820]  Those are pretty awesome.
[22:24.820 --> 22:26.140]  There are a couple other things that I've made
[22:26.140 --> 22:28.620]  that I haven't even released that are pretty awesome
[22:28.620 --> 22:29.700]  that I'm not even gonna talk about.
[22:29.700 --> 22:32.500]  The King Kem Grape Stomper OG crosses
[22:32.500 --> 22:34.580]  bred to some other stuff were pretty rad.
[22:34.580 --> 22:37.260]  But the reason I can't breed everything to everything,
[22:37.260 --> 22:38.100]  I wanna go back to that
[22:38.100 --> 22:39.660]  is because I will bottleneck myself.
[22:39.660 --> 22:40.740]  I'll work everything,
[22:40.740 --> 22:43.260]  we'll all be Jack the Ripper cross to arise
[22:43.260 --> 22:44.360]  cross to the same shit.
[22:44.360 --> 22:47.580]  So that's why you see me looking for new males occasionally.
[22:47.620 --> 22:49.620]  That's why every year or two years
[22:49.620 --> 22:51.380]  I bust out a new feminized project
[22:51.380 --> 22:53.420]  because I just need a different male plant
[22:53.420 --> 22:55.060]  to open up my breeding.
[22:55.060 --> 22:56.460]  I'm limited by plant counts.
[22:56.460 --> 22:58.500]  I'm very, very limited by the amount of plants
[22:58.500 --> 23:00.780]  which I can have here in the state of Colorado.
[23:00.780 --> 23:02.580]  And in the position which I have put myself in
[23:02.580 --> 23:05.740]  in the community, on YouTube, everywhere,
[23:05.740 --> 23:08.020]  my face, if you think about cannabis,
[23:08.020 --> 23:10.820]  you probably a lot of times my name is associated with that.
[23:10.820 --> 23:13.780]  So they, whoever they are, Babylon knows who I am.
[23:13.780 --> 23:15.900]  So I've got to follow the rules, be really careful.
[23:15.900 --> 23:17.260]  I don't have an extra leaf.
[23:17.940 --> 23:20.300]  If I'm allowed 600 leaves, I got 599 leaves.
[23:20.300 --> 23:21.140]  You know what I'm saying?
[23:21.140 --> 23:21.960]  I'm following the rules.
[23:21.960 --> 23:23.900]  So very limited by the amount of plants
[23:23.900 --> 23:25.820]  which I can have now because all these regulations
[23:25.820 --> 23:27.900]  and how fucking known I've made myself.
[23:27.900 --> 23:30.500]  That's my fault, but that was my choice as well, I guess.
[23:30.500 --> 23:31.340]  But I'm well known.
[23:31.340 --> 23:32.460]  So I gotta be careful.
[23:32.460 --> 23:34.480]  I'm kind of like fucking poster boy now.
[23:34.480 --> 23:36.500]  So I gotta be very careful on my plant count.
[23:36.500 --> 23:38.140]  So I've got the legal amount of plants.
[23:38.140 --> 23:40.620]  So I can't, I don't wanna get rid of something
[23:40.620 --> 23:42.060]  because if I get rid of it,
[23:42.060 --> 23:43.380]  then I can't make more seeds of that.
[23:43.380 --> 23:44.220]  I can't breed it.
[23:44.220 --> 23:46.040]  And the things I've got, I've fallen in love with.
[23:46.040 --> 23:49.160]  So to find another male, I just reverse a female.
[23:49.160 --> 23:52.120]  It seems like a great way to open up my opportunities.
[23:52.120 --> 23:54.180]  Then all of my female plants also can work
[23:54.180 --> 23:56.620]  as male plants and it just gives me
[23:56.620 --> 23:58.960]  that many more options to play with.
[23:58.960 --> 24:00.540]  All right, I know I kind of danced around the question
[24:00.540 --> 24:02.800]  about what else would make amazing stuff.
[24:03.640 --> 24:05.360]  Anything with a different male,
[24:05.360 --> 24:06.900]  cross to anything with a different male
[24:06.900 --> 24:08.800]  from my line would be cool, I think.
[24:08.800 --> 24:10.080]  It would all work very well
[24:10.080 --> 24:12.980]  because my selections have been very, very good.
[24:12.980 --> 24:15.520]  The true Kush, the truth, cross to everything.
[24:15.960 --> 24:17.080]  If I could get my indica dominance, true Kush to arise,
[24:17.080 --> 24:18.960]  the truth would make some really super stinky
[24:18.960 --> 24:21.400]  indica dominant stuff that I wanted to do.
[24:21.400 --> 24:23.680]  That chemdale a chem cross is gonna be great.
[24:23.680 --> 24:26.160]  But yeah, I'm kind of rambling about that
[24:26.160 --> 24:27.760]  because I wanted to dance around that.
[24:27.760 --> 24:29.800]  I do approve if you wanna make those S1 seeds
[24:29.800 --> 24:31.200]  and pass them out to your friends.
[24:31.200 --> 24:32.200]  I have no problem with that.
[24:32.200 --> 24:33.680]  Don't make money off of them.
[24:34.600 --> 24:35.820]  And then just think about what you're doing
[24:35.820 --> 24:36.700]  when it comes to breeding.
[24:36.700 --> 24:38.440]  Make sure you don't bottleneck yourself.
[24:38.440 --> 24:39.760]  Make sure you don't inbreed too much
[24:39.760 --> 24:41.600]  unless that's what you mean to do.
[24:41.600 --> 24:43.760]  That's when you start pulling out those traits
[24:43.760 --> 24:46.480]  from the plants that you have a lot of the mix in.
[24:46.480 --> 24:47.520]  It's like chefing.
[24:47.520 --> 24:49.520]  If you put two ingredients and two ingredients
[24:49.520 --> 24:50.640]  that are the same on both sides,
[24:50.640 --> 24:52.540]  when you mix those two bowls together,
[24:52.540 --> 24:54.640]  those two ingredients are gonna dominate the mix.
[24:54.640 --> 24:55.760]  You're not gonna be able to wash those
[24:55.760 --> 24:57.080]  out of the flavor at all.
[24:57.080 --> 24:59.960]  All right, there are more questions for this show.
[24:59.960 --> 25:01.520]  I don't wanna ramble on for too long.
[25:01.520 --> 25:03.520]  I got too stoned and rambled a lot in this episode.
[25:03.520 --> 25:04.600]  There are a couple of edit points
[25:04.600 --> 25:06.040]  I need to make sure to catch.
[25:06.960 --> 25:08.160]  Let's see, where do we go?
[25:08.160 --> 25:10.160]  This one came from our friend, Sinsi11.
[25:10.160 --> 25:12.600]  Shout out to Sinsi11 on Patreon.
[25:12.880 --> 25:14.480]  It goes like this, it says,
[25:14.480 --> 25:16.280]  pollination back to 18-6.
[25:16.280 --> 25:18.000]  My head grower and I pussed out
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.840]  on flipping the cross tent back to 18-6.
[25:20.840 --> 25:23.840]  We both said wouldn't this cause problems
[25:23.840 --> 25:25.040]  after I brought it up?
[25:25.040 --> 25:26.800]  If it doesn't cause problems, why?
[25:26.800 --> 25:29.880]  And how many days after pollination is cool to do it?
[25:29.880 --> 25:32.120]  All right, so what they're talking about
[25:32.120 --> 25:34.960]  is when I pollinate plants, when I'm breeding,
[25:34.960 --> 25:37.520]  when my plants are only intended for seed,
[25:37.520 --> 25:40.040]  after pollination, I wait a couple of days,
[25:40.040 --> 25:41.800]  maybe three, five, maybe seven days,
[25:41.800 --> 25:43.720]  depending on how the plants react.
[25:43.720 --> 25:47.760]  Then I will turn my lights back to an 18-6 cycle.
[25:47.760 --> 25:49.400]  And you're gonna say, why would you do that?
[25:49.400 --> 25:51.480]  Because I'm not growing buds, I'm growing seeds.
[25:51.480 --> 25:53.200]  I don't care what the buds look like.
[25:53.200 --> 25:56.000]  I'm not worried about trichomes, buds, flowers.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.960]  I'm 100% focused on making quality seed
[25:58.960 --> 26:00.920]  for the consumer, which is you.
[26:00.920 --> 26:03.800]  So I turn my light timer back to 18-6.
[26:03.800 --> 26:04.640]  Why?
[26:04.640 --> 26:07.640]  Because light is the main source of energy for our plant.
[26:07.640 --> 26:09.840]  That's the main nutrient that our plant wants.
[26:09.840 --> 26:12.480]  Also, the main nutrient, the main source of energy
[26:12.480 --> 26:15.240]  to make those seeds get big, fat, beefy, healthy,
[26:15.240 --> 26:19.160]  and harden up faster, quicker, and earlier than ever before.
[26:19.160 --> 26:21.040]  So I'm giving them more light.
[26:21.040 --> 26:24.760]  They're using, so they're getting six hours more,
[26:24.760 --> 26:26.880]  they're getting half a day more light every day
[26:26.880 --> 26:28.480]  than they would if they were on flower.
[26:28.480 --> 26:31.120]  So that cuts down my flowering time by a couple of weeks
[26:31.120 --> 26:33.680]  because they're getting the light they need for growth
[26:33.680 --> 26:35.600]  during the day hours that they're on.
[26:35.600 --> 26:38.280]  My flowers turn to shit.
[26:38.280 --> 26:41.000]  My flowers look like a fucking mess.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.880]  My flowers start to revege.
[26:42.880 --> 26:44.200]  They start throwing out shoots
[26:44.200 --> 26:45.880]  and making weird-shaped leaves,
[26:45.880 --> 26:47.600]  and they do all kinds of crazy, funky shit.
[26:47.600 --> 26:49.080]  But you know what?
[26:49.080 --> 26:50.320]  I don't care.
[26:50.320 --> 26:51.800]  I'm not growing for buds.
[26:51.800 --> 26:53.200]  I'm not growing for buds at all.
[26:53.200 --> 26:54.640]  I throw the buds away.
[26:54.640 --> 26:57.240]  I cut the plants down, I let them dry to a crisp.
[26:57.240 --> 26:59.140]  I put on rubber gloves and I go like this.
[26:59.140 --> 27:01.020]  I'll do it over the mic so the audio listeners can hear.
[27:01.020 --> 27:04.260]  I go like this with the buds between my hands,
[27:04.260 --> 27:06.820]  and they crumble up into dust and all the seeds fall out.
[27:06.820 --> 27:08.660]  I run that whole pile of stuff,
[27:08.660 --> 27:11.140]  the dust, the sticks, and everything through a seed sorter,
[27:11.140 --> 27:13.060]  and it pulls the seeds out for me.
[27:13.060 --> 27:16.100]  The leftover shit that's not seeds is all trash.
[27:16.100 --> 27:17.560]  It all goes in a compost bin.
[27:17.560 --> 27:19.140]  I don't do anything with that.
[27:19.980 --> 27:21.540]  It's been so beat up.
[27:21.540 --> 27:23.360]  It's been so finger-banged and destroyed
[27:23.360 --> 27:26.000]  through the extraction process of getting the seeds out.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.220]  It is absolutely useless to me.
[27:28.220 --> 27:29.380]  We've made edibles out of it.
[27:29.380 --> 27:30.700]  We've made concentrates out of it.
[27:30.700 --> 27:32.100]  It's not worth it.
[27:32.100 --> 27:34.140]  It's green, it's funky, it tastes terrible.
[27:34.140 --> 27:35.300]  It's just been abused.
[27:35.300 --> 27:37.220]  So all that is trash.
[27:37.220 --> 27:38.900]  So it will fuck up your plants.
[27:38.900 --> 27:40.060]  Your plants will look like shit.
[27:40.060 --> 27:41.300]  They'll go back into veg.
[27:41.300 --> 27:42.900]  They'll start shooting out shoots.
[27:42.900 --> 27:45.580]  They're gonna make all kind of crazy mutated leaves
[27:45.580 --> 27:48.020]  and weird shapes, but I don't care.
[27:48.020 --> 27:49.920]  I'm not growing for buds at this point.
[27:49.920 --> 27:52.580]  What I'm talking about is purely a seeded crop.
[27:52.580 --> 27:54.420]  I'm only looking for seeds.
[27:54.420 --> 27:56.540]  Once you cut those down and pull the seeds out,
[27:56.540 --> 27:58.140]  show me what the buds look like.
[27:59.100 --> 28:00.640]  Show me, tell me what the buds look like
[28:00.640 --> 28:02.060]  when you have those seeds in your hand.
[28:02.060 --> 28:03.580]  No one's ever gonna know that those plants
[28:03.580 --> 28:04.740]  looked like fucking aliens.
[28:05.180 --> 28:06.020]  They looked sad.
[28:06.020 --> 28:08.540]  They looked like they're in fucking some hostage situation,
[28:08.540 --> 28:11.740]  but the seeds are amazing because they got more light.
[28:11.740 --> 28:13.780]  They were able to photosynthesize faster.
[28:13.780 --> 28:15.980]  They came down maybe three weeks sooner
[28:15.980 --> 28:18.940]  than the plants that I did not put on the 18-6 cycle.
[28:18.940 --> 28:21.220]  So don't puss out.
[28:21.220 --> 28:22.180]  Don't be afraid.
[28:22.180 --> 28:23.260]  It does cause problems.
[28:23.260 --> 28:25.580]  It makes the plants go fucking completely bonkers,
[28:25.580 --> 28:28.020]  but aren't you growing for seeds and not buds?
[28:28.020 --> 28:30.180]  Gotta focus on the goal here.
[28:30.180 --> 28:31.460]  Worry about the outcome,
[28:31.460 --> 28:33.260]  not the process getting to the outcome.
[28:33.260 --> 28:35.340]  Think about what's going on.
[28:35.340 --> 28:37.340]  I wanna read the question in my head one more time.
[28:37.340 --> 28:39.340]  Make sure I covered all this stuff here.
[28:39.340 --> 28:41.260]  I had grower pussed out.
[28:41.260 --> 28:42.300]  Said it would cause problems.
[28:42.300 --> 28:44.220]  Yeah, what kind of problems, bro?
[28:44.220 --> 28:45.060]  No problems, dude.
[28:45.060 --> 28:46.220]  It's just gonna make your seeds better.
[28:46.220 --> 28:48.460]  And if you're growing for a flower, don't do this.
[28:48.460 --> 28:49.460]  If you're growing for a flower,
[28:49.460 --> 28:52.380]  wait until the last 10 to 14 days to flip it back.
[28:52.380 --> 28:53.580]  Then that is cool.
[28:53.580 --> 28:54.980]  But if you're growing with seeds,
[28:54.980 --> 28:56.380]  do it about three, five,
[28:56.380 --> 28:58.620]  maybe seven to 10 days after pollination.
[28:58.620 --> 28:59.900]  So shortly after pollination,
[28:59.900 --> 29:02.340]  it is safe to turn those lights back to 18-6.
[29:02.540 --> 29:05.380]  Once you see that they're all curled up
[29:05.380 --> 29:06.420]  and they look like they're pollinated,
[29:06.420 --> 29:08.100]  you can see the little seeds forming in there.
[29:08.100 --> 29:10.100]  Put it back on 18-6.
[29:10.100 --> 29:11.460]  There's no problem with that.
[29:11.460 --> 29:12.500]  They're gonna eat more.
[29:12.500 --> 29:13.580]  They're gonna grow more.
[29:13.580 --> 29:14.660]  They're gonna finish sooner.
[29:14.660 --> 29:17.100]  The seeds will be bigger, harder, and fatter.
[29:17.100 --> 29:19.940]  This last crop of Jack the Ripper seeds that I made
[29:19.940 --> 29:22.180]  was finished under 18-6 under LEDs,
[29:22.180 --> 29:24.900]  and they're the biggest, fattest seeds I've ever bred
[29:24.900 --> 29:28.340]  with the highest germination rate I've ever accomplished.
[29:28.340 --> 29:30.020]  So don't puss out.
[29:30.020 --> 29:31.140]  Have confidence in yourself.
[29:31.140 --> 29:32.740]  Have faith in what I'm teaching you.
[29:32.740 --> 29:33.780]  And if it goes wrong,
[29:33.780 --> 29:35.260]  send me a bunch of fucking hate mail.
[29:35.260 --> 29:36.100]  Tell me I'm an idiot.
[29:36.100 --> 29:38.020]  Blast me all over the internet.
[29:38.020 --> 29:38.860]  I'm not wrong.
[29:38.860 --> 29:39.680]  All right.
[29:39.680 --> 29:41.460]  I think that is all I've got for this episode, you guys.
[29:41.460 --> 29:42.660]  We've gone for quite a long time.
[29:42.660 --> 29:43.780]  I'm quite rambly.
[29:43.780 --> 29:46.700]  Also, my throat's getting dry and my ADD is kicking in.
[29:46.700 --> 29:48.700]  So I think it is time to wrap up this episode.
[29:48.700 --> 29:50.060]  I wanna thank everybody for hanging out
