[00:35.080 --> 00:39.960]  this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host,
[00:39.960 --> 00:42.560]  my friends call me Ross DeGeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.880 --> 00:44.400]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you.
[00:44.400 --> 00:47.200]  Shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music
[00:47.200 --> 00:52.120]  on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.160 --> 00:55.480]  I hope everybody's having a great week. Ladies and gentlemen,

[00:58.120 --> 00:59.840]  Make sure you follow White Mike's Facebook page,
[00:59.880 --> 01:01.480]  Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[01:01.480 --> 01:04.840]  Make sure you support all the sensible cannabis laws. You guys,
[01:04.840 --> 01:07.240]  I don't want to do too long of an intro. I'm just going to let the music play.
[01:07.320 --> 01:09.440]  I'm going to get right back. I'll be joined by our good friend,
[01:09.440 --> 01:10.280]  White Mike. Hang out.
[01:21.680 --> 01:24.720]  I think that's how the podcast is going to start is with a big fat fuck blue
[01:24.720 --> 01:28.320]  dream. Uh, so, uh, you guys, we are back. We're here.
[01:28.920 --> 01:31.760]  It's going to say at the studio. Is this, can this officially be a studio?
[01:31.840 --> 01:34.760]  I think when all the gears out, we can call it a studio. I think that's fair.
[01:35.200 --> 01:38.560]  So today we've got the pocket studio. We're recording on the, we are recording.
[01:38.560 --> 01:41.640]  My mouth is fucking high. My brain's not as high as my mouth. I think.
[01:42.040 --> 01:44.560]  Uh, we're recording on the zoom H six handy recorder. You guys,
[01:44.560 --> 01:45.640]  I'm doing a little test run.
[01:45.640 --> 01:48.360]  I want to make sure that I've got this figured out because I'm going to go
[01:48.360 --> 01:49.680]  record with dab and granny again.
[01:49.680 --> 01:53.240]  So here on the podcast with me in the, uh, the makeshift pocket studio is our
[01:53.240 --> 01:54.720]  buddy. White Mike. Welcome back, bro.
[01:54.920 --> 01:57.960]  Thanks man. Uh, let's do this part that I always like to do.
[01:57.960 --> 01:59.720]  Tell everybody that's listening, uh,
[01:59.760 --> 02:02.480]  where they can stalk you on social media so that they can check you out while
[02:02.480 --> 02:03.320]  they're listening.
[02:03.520 --> 02:07.320]  A Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook and, uh,
[02:07.360 --> 02:09.320]  at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[02:09.600 --> 02:11.760]  Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[02:11.760 --> 02:14.040]  What kind of stuff are we going to see if we go to the Pueblo for sensible
[02:14.040 --> 02:15.280]  cannabis laws, Facebook page?
[02:15.320 --> 02:19.280]  Um, pretty much any marijuana news related event I can find that's,
[02:19.400 --> 02:22.600]  even remotely relevant to the U S gets linked up there.
[02:22.760 --> 02:25.120]  I appreciate what you do for the cannabis industry and for the cannabis
[02:25.120 --> 02:25.960]  community.
[02:26.120 --> 02:26.720]  Thank you, man.
[02:26.720 --> 02:29.800]  Uh, I'm not, I'm a working man and I'm always at a grow.
[02:29.800 --> 02:32.640]  Anybody that listens to the podcast regularly knows that, uh,
[02:32.640 --> 02:37.280]  I am the lead cultivator of a hundred light facility. So that keeps me busy.
[02:37.280 --> 02:41.480]  I've got a day job. Most of the politics happens during the day.
[02:42.040 --> 02:45.040]  So when there's politicking to be done, when there's a,
[02:45.400 --> 02:48.560]  people have to go to city council meetings and speak and show support when that
[02:48.560 --> 02:49.640]  stuff is to be done.
[02:49.680 --> 02:53.520]  Mike is the guy that goes and does that in my my place because I am stuck at the
[02:53.520 --> 02:55.920]  grow. So thanks for doing that kind of stuff.
[02:55.920 --> 02:58.320]  Thanks for having a Facebook page to keep our community together.
[02:58.320 --> 03:00.600]  Thanks to all the people that help with Mike, uh,
[03:00.640 --> 03:03.600]  Mike's organizations and all the people that join up with Mike to go to all
[03:03.600 --> 03:06.720]  these rallies, to go protest things. Big shout out to all those people.
[03:06.920 --> 03:10.840]  If there are a couple of pro, uh, uh, what's the word activists in town?
[03:10.840 --> 03:11.680]  I couldn't think of the word act.
[03:11.680 --> 03:15.760]  There are several now it's kind of nice that I'm not totally alone anymore.
[03:15.800 --> 03:18.000]  Do you want to give two or three of them some shout outs?
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.080]  Anybody that may deserve a big fat thumbs up?
[03:20.480 --> 03:23.840]  Um, juicy Jay is, uh,
[03:23.880 --> 03:28.760]  been doing a lot of stuff on social media that I love. Um,
[03:28.920 --> 03:30.400]  there's a guy named Brooks.
[03:30.400 --> 03:34.760]  That's been doing a ton of stuff on social media right now. Lots of great, uh,
[03:35.240 --> 03:39.720]  infographic memes, uh, for our side and our fight down here. Uh,
[03:39.760 --> 03:43.000]  he's been doing some amazing work and, uh, I really appreciate it.
[03:43.400 --> 03:47.320]  Some of his work shared to my page has gotten record views and shares and stuff
[03:47.360 --> 03:50.480]  like that. So nice. J and Brooks. Yep.
[03:51.720 --> 03:53.480]  Thanks for supporting the cannabis community. You guys,
[03:53.480 --> 03:57.760]  we need people like you on the team. Uh, Mike dude. Awesome.
[03:57.760 --> 04:00.400]  You showed up with this, uh, orange flavor,
[04:00.400 --> 04:03.640]  re citrusy grapefruit hash. Tell me a little more about that.
[04:03.680 --> 04:08.280]  Lemon thyme, sugar wax, um, from a rock and extracts.
[04:08.280 --> 04:13.160]  It's a new Pueblo company. Um, I really like it. I took it to, uh,
[04:13.280 --> 04:16.640]  just as something fun to take along with me to a meeting of several, uh,
[04:17.280 --> 04:20.960]  dab kids is the wrong term, but it's the closest one we got, I guess. But, uh,
[04:21.400 --> 04:24.480]  several folks getting together, dabbing and it ended up being the talk of the
[04:24.480 --> 04:28.960]  table. Um, which I thought was funny cause we were dabbing raw turps,
[04:29.040 --> 04:31.320]  um, on distillate that night too.
[04:31.840 --> 04:34.400]  Is this a, sorry about the fucked up throw. You guys,
[04:34.400 --> 04:37.600]  we've been taking dabs like we're talking about. Is this a live resin or is this
[04:37.600 --> 04:40.240]  a, a fresh frozen product? How much do you know about that?
[04:40.320 --> 04:44.440]  Um, I'm actually not sure on that particular step. Um,
[04:44.440 --> 04:49.440]  the big part of the big pitch of this company is it's a proprietary mixed gas
[04:51.160 --> 04:54.720]  extraction. That explains a lot to me. Uh, somebody that knows a lot,
[04:54.720 --> 04:58.080]  not a lot, but that smokes a lot of different types of concentrates.
[04:58.280 --> 05:00.800]  I can tell that this, that's why I asked if it was live resin,
[05:01.760 --> 05:05.120]  the texture, the color and texture, the color and texture are not, uh,
[05:05.280 --> 05:08.480]  what I'm used to seeing from a butane extraction unless it's live resin.
[05:08.720 --> 05:11.360]  But that is very, very close to what I see.
[05:11.360 --> 05:16.080]  What do you call that color? Um, man, I don't know what color.
[05:17.040 --> 05:19.480]  And it's a butterscotch color. That's a really good description of it.
[05:19.480 --> 05:20.960]  It's not orange. It's not yellow.
[05:21.520 --> 05:25.720]  And when it was fresh, it had a little more orange yellowish,
[05:27.040 --> 05:32.040]  um, pop to it. Okay. But, uh, it's a propane butane mix.
[05:32.440 --> 05:33.280]  I can see the propane.
[05:34.360 --> 05:38.280]  This is legitimately the first propane hash I've ever dabbed. I've seen it made.
[05:38.280 --> 05:42.520]  There's a great vice media documentary where they go and interview a guy
[05:42.520 --> 05:45.520]  building a propane extraction rig in the,
[05:45.520 --> 05:49.040]  the hash that comes out of that is like frighteningly orange, like cheese at
[05:49.040 --> 05:50.480]  orange. Okay. Wow. What I've, uh,
[05:50.520 --> 05:54.400]  I've smoked a bunch of propane hash oil from our friends at altitude organic
[05:54.400 --> 05:56.840]  medicine. Excuse me for that. You guys,
[05:57.560 --> 06:00.560]  I've smoked a bunch of propane hash from altitude and it's always white,
[06:00.880 --> 06:03.000]  like completely white and it's real, uh,
[06:03.040 --> 06:05.560]  it's kind of mushy and it always tastes really good.
[06:05.800 --> 06:09.400]  What I don't like about it is it kind of makes my lungs feel sort of heavy.
[06:09.720 --> 06:11.480]  It gives me a butter long sort of feeling.
[06:11.760 --> 06:16.120]  Um, I over dabbed myself with some of this one night. I, uh,
[06:16.120 --> 06:20.480]  I way overheated my banger and took, um, an insanely hot dab,
[06:20.480 --> 06:24.320]  just not paying attention. The last one I'd taken a little cool.
[06:24.320 --> 06:26.000]  So I was a little, you know, Johnny,
[06:28.120 --> 06:31.920]  and uh, uh, while I was coughing, the cough seemed to go on quite a while.
[06:31.920 --> 06:35.280]  And for a minute I considered, is it the mixed gas?
[06:35.680 --> 06:39.240]  But, uh, um, from everything I've seen, all the lab testing, it's, uh,
[06:39.280 --> 06:40.320]  it's totally clean.
[06:40.600 --> 06:41.440]  Okay. Well,
[06:41.480 --> 06:45.080]  we talked about lipids and plant fats and all that kind of stuff on an episode
[06:45.080 --> 06:45.520]  previous.
[06:45.520 --> 06:49.240]  So I wonder if there are plant paraffins and lipids and stuff like that left
[06:49.240 --> 06:53.280]  behind in there that they're not taken out either way. It's marvelous.
[06:53.280 --> 06:57.320]  Hash is what I wanted to get to the flavors. Oh my goodness. Yeah. It's like, uh,
[06:57.640 --> 07:00.880]  at first it was like orangey and then I waited a few minutes and as my mouth
[07:00.880 --> 07:04.080]  dried up, it turned to grapefruits, just straight up grapefruits on my tongue.
[07:04.080 --> 07:06.240]  It was really delicious. I didn't want to take a drink for a while,
[07:06.240 --> 07:09.560]  but I had to cause I was still got the grapefruit coating. Now it's really nice.
[07:09.560 --> 07:11.440]  Nice. Uh, good job on bringing the good hash.
[07:11.440 --> 07:15.520]  Big shout out to rock and extracts. You said they're a Pueblo company. Yeah.
[07:15.520 --> 07:18.440]  They're a, they're right at the street from my, or from the shop.
[07:18.480 --> 07:22.600]  That's pretty cool. Uh, yeah. They, uh, good guys.
[07:22.600 --> 07:24.280]  They make several different products.
[07:24.800 --> 07:27.560]  Their deliveries better always be on time. Yeah. They're never,
[07:27.800 --> 07:31.600]  they walk them over. It's cute. Um, but yeah, they're, uh,
[07:31.800 --> 07:35.200]  can you do that legally with the manifest? Can you walk over a product? Yep.
[07:35.440 --> 07:37.120]  All right. Um, they, uh,
[07:38.120 --> 07:40.560]  they make it a couple of different products that I'm enjoying right now.
[07:40.560 --> 07:42.720]  They've also got the first vape pen cartridge.
[07:42.720 --> 07:46.600]  I've actually not felt bad about spending money on. Nice. Yep.
[07:46.800 --> 07:49.360]  Does it come in flavors or is it just one flavor? Uh,
[07:49.360 --> 07:53.160]  right now it's just a single extract run. Uh, so it's a mixed batch,
[07:53.160 --> 07:57.920]  no strain specific sativa or Indica, a hybrid blend. Of course.
[07:57.960 --> 08:01.160]  Um, they just threw a bunch of shit together. Yeah. It was, well,
[08:01.520 --> 08:04.960]  I have a feeling it's half Clementine half blue dream, um,
[08:04.960 --> 08:09.600]  is honestly what I think it is. Fuck blue dream. Um, but yeah,
[08:09.600 --> 08:12.640]  I've been enjoying the hell out of the sugar wax. Super tasty hash,
[08:12.640 --> 08:13.880]  high quality. So I'm high as shit.
[08:13.880 --> 08:16.080]  When you guys go into your local weed store,
[08:16.080 --> 08:18.160]  if that's the thing where you are asking what, uh,
[08:18.160 --> 08:20.680]  what new stuff is in and check out new stuff. Don't, uh,
[08:20.680 --> 08:23.600]  don't get set in a total routine. There's a lot of new cool stuff coming out.
[08:23.600 --> 08:25.000]  You should check out what's new. You know,
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.040]  I kind of stepped out of my little box. I was,
[08:27.440 --> 08:29.200]  I was really familiar with Turpex. I mean,
[08:29.200 --> 08:31.760]  I grow the product at green and healthy. We take it to Turpex.
[08:31.760 --> 08:34.760]  They turn it into concentrates for us. Why wouldn't I buy that?
[08:34.760 --> 08:38.920]  You know what I mean? But lately I've been buying, uh, the craft extracts. Uh,
[08:38.920 --> 08:42.680]  the craft makes really good products. I've been getting extracts ink. Uh,
[08:42.680 --> 08:44.240]  I think that's what they're called extracts. Yeah.
[08:44.240 --> 08:47.800]  They make really good products. Uh, I had some Darth cookies the other day.
[08:47.800 --> 08:51.080]  It was really tasty stuff. Like I've been stepping out of my normal seven,
[08:51.080 --> 08:53.400]  10 labs. Really good shit. Viola. You know,
[08:53.400 --> 08:56.480]  if you get the right batch of Viola, it'll taste really good. Uh, yeah.
[08:56.640 --> 08:59.160]  Check out new shit. Don't be, don't be afraid to try new stuff.
[08:59.160 --> 09:01.760]  You're going to get a quality product. I'd been, uh,
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.560]  I'd spent a lot of time going through the edible section,
[09:04.560 --> 09:06.720]  making sure I tried kind of one of everything.
[09:07.160 --> 09:09.800]  And I'm doing the same thing with the hash lately. And it's, uh,
[09:09.840 --> 09:12.320]  it's a lot of fun. It's fun watching you step up your hash game.
[09:12.640 --> 09:14.920]  It's so expensive piece by piece.
[09:16.640 --> 09:20.320]  You started off basic. I think I gave you your first stab probably. Yep.
[09:20.480 --> 09:23.760]  I would assume. Yeah. Yeah. It was a downstairs on the swing arm skillet.
[09:23.880 --> 09:26.760]  Oh gosh. The hot oil days. Yeah.
[09:26.800 --> 09:31.760]  The syringe of black CO2 oil on the dabber on the dental pick dabber
[09:31.760 --> 09:35.400]  days. Oh, those days when they were selling us dental pick dabbers at the events
[09:35.400 --> 09:38.440]  for like the price of dab tools and they were just old dental dabbers from
[09:38.440 --> 09:42.520]  Pakistan. Yep. Yeah. Oh man. So, but it's good to see you've stepped up.
[09:42.520 --> 09:45.640]  You went from taking little tiny dabs of just boo boo to now you take pretty
[09:45.640 --> 09:49.760]  good size dabs of some Clementine sugar wax, bro. Right. It's nice.
[09:49.960 --> 09:52.680]  I got you a decent size dab of some pineapple Jack set up there.
[09:52.680 --> 09:55.400]  That's going to make you cough pretty good. The last pineapple Jack,
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.280]  which company made this was a Terp. Yeah, this is from the Turpex. Uh, the,
[10:00.280 --> 10:04.520]  the S the shop got in a shipment of that a long time ago and I ended up with
[10:04.520 --> 10:08.560]  like eight of them at home. By the time we sold out, I had a backstash.
[10:08.600 --> 10:12.520]  I probably grew that. It was delicious. Yeah. That's a really great strain.
[10:12.520 --> 10:15.680]  It grows very well. Very, very well. It's a,
[10:15.720 --> 10:18.280]  it's actually New York pineapple diesel is what it would be.
[10:18.280 --> 10:21.040]  It's a pineapple diesel cross on accident, I think,
[10:21.080 --> 10:23.800]  but there were a bunch of seeds and that's what came out as that phenotype and
[10:23.800 --> 10:28.440]  it grows like a fucking savage. Super sweet. It's a great, it's a great plant.
[10:28.600 --> 10:29.960]  So we've been talking for quite a while here.
[10:29.960 --> 10:32.120]  I don't think we've gotten in the any sort of topic out.
[10:32.120 --> 10:35.800]  Well I'd say just dab. You let the listeners know what the topics. Yeah, yeah.
[10:35.800 --> 10:39.080]  Well the first time I'm going to read a couple of a email, uh, maybe,
[10:39.120 --> 10:41.800]  maybe two depends on how long we go. I'm going to read one email.
[10:41.920 --> 10:44.920]  We'll talk about that. I should find my phone because it's on there. Uh,
[10:44.920 --> 10:48.920]  I wanted to remind everybody that I did promise everybody a podcast about the
[10:49.120 --> 10:51.560]  dabbing granny or featuring the dabbing granny.
[10:51.560 --> 10:55.400]  I recorded that podcast at the Cana Canyon and unfortunately I got home and my
[10:55.400 --> 10:58.480]  memory card would not let me pull the files.
[10:58.520 --> 11:01.200]  It would let me drag the files from the memory card to my desktop,
[11:01.200 --> 11:03.800]  but they will not play. They won't play from the memory card.
[11:03.800 --> 11:05.320]  They won't play from the desktop.
[11:05.720 --> 11:09.920]  I even took the zoom H six and ran the USB cable to the computer and tried to
[11:09.920 --> 11:13.040]  open the files that way and use it as a file reader. It will not do it.
[11:13.640 --> 11:16.600]  So far with my tech skills that that shows lost.
[11:16.600 --> 11:20.240]  So what I've done is I set up another show. Um,
[11:20.440 --> 11:22.760]  I'm not going to tell you when cause you might show up. That's creepy.
[11:22.920 --> 11:25.520]  But in the future, dabbing granny, myself, Brett,
[11:25.560 --> 11:28.680]  Lindsay and maybe a couple of the folks are going to congregate at the Cana
[11:28.680 --> 11:31.880]  Canyon. Mike is going to cough his face off. Hang out, bro.
[11:31.880 --> 11:33.960]  You don't have to run and do it. We'll leave your mic on and everything.
[11:35.160 --> 11:39.360]  He's purple. You guys used to him. He's tomato red, turn a purple again. Uh,
[11:39.400 --> 11:43.080]  but we're going to rerecord the dabbing granny podcast. So stick around.
[11:43.080 --> 11:46.480]  That'll be coming up in the, in the very near future. Uh,
[11:46.480 --> 11:49.560]  we're going to read that email. I said that the one thing I wanted to talk
[11:49.560 --> 11:50.640]  about with Mike, the main thing,
[11:50.640 --> 11:54.120]  cause Mike is our smart friend that comes over with smart shit. Uh,
[11:54.520 --> 11:58.800]  ladies and gentlemen, the DEA has failed to reschedule cannabis.
[11:59.080 --> 12:03.560]  Cannabis is still considered a schedule one drug, which, uh, let me,
[12:03.600 --> 12:04.480]  let me tell you what that means.
[12:04.480 --> 12:08.000]  Schedule one drugs are the most dangerous drugs with the most potential for
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.480]  abuse and psychological dependence.
[12:10.720 --> 12:15.080]  So now cannabis still is in the same category as LSD,
[12:15.200 --> 12:19.240]  as heroin and ecstasy. There is no medicinal value.
[12:20.480 --> 12:21.640]  Mike, how do you feel about that?
[12:23.240 --> 12:26.600]  I saw it coming a mile away, but I'm still a little disappointed.
[12:27.440 --> 12:28.520]  It's 2016.
[12:28.680 --> 12:30.080]  So about 90 days ago,
[12:30.400 --> 12:33.720]  the DEA said that they were considering rescheduling cannabis.
[12:33.920 --> 12:35.520]  They taunted everybody. They teased us.
[12:35.520 --> 12:38.800]  They made us all think that there may be a change. And then in 90 days,
[12:38.880 --> 12:41.240]  they just said, Oh, nevermind. Sorry. We're not going to do that.
[12:41.400 --> 12:44.280]  Well, there was a change and it is big.
[12:44.840 --> 12:48.920]  It's just not as big as the media made it sound. Uh,
[12:48.920 --> 12:53.240]  they didn't reschedule cannabis, but they did open up, um,
[12:53.280 --> 12:58.240]  more research, uh, growths production sites for cannabis, um,
[12:58.280 --> 13:01.640]  for pretty much everybody listening his whole lifetime.
[13:02.120 --> 13:05.680]  The feds have been growing marijuana for research purposes at the university of
[13:05.700 --> 13:10.640]  Mississippi. Sorry, I'm still dabbed out, but, um,
[13:11.880 --> 13:13.480]  uh, that's the only farm that grew it.
[13:13.480 --> 13:16.680]  And if you've been watching Sanjay Gupta's weed one,
[13:16.700 --> 13:20.000]  two and three specials on CNN, they covered the,
[13:20.280 --> 13:24.440]  the research restriction topic pretty well. Basically, uh,
[13:24.480 --> 13:29.360]  there's only one farm growing research marijuana in the U S which means there's
[13:29.360 --> 13:34.160]  almost no variety of cannabis to research in the U S they've only got
[13:34.160 --> 13:37.880]  four strains or some really restricted numbers. Sorry.
[13:37.880 --> 13:39.240]  My lungs are still going a little nuts.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.400]  We can hear it, but you're good. You're saying you're making enough sense to make
[13:42.400 --> 13:45.640]  it matter. Yeah. I hope you guys are following along.
[13:45.640 --> 13:48.840]  I'm trying really hard not to cough up right into the mic.
[13:48.840 --> 13:50.960]  He's doing really well too. You should see the look on his face.
[13:51.160 --> 13:53.840]  So I'll jump in for a second. This makes you dumb. It's nonsense.
[13:53.840 --> 13:56.680]  You're just stoned. You guys that, uh, that cannabis,
[13:57.040 --> 14:00.960]  I've seen the cannabis that they grow at that facility there in Mississippi and
[14:00.960 --> 14:03.280]  it's garbage. They don't have a proper growth facility.
[14:03.280 --> 14:06.080]  They don't have proper technique. I don't think they have good genetics.
[14:06.200 --> 14:09.440]  I've seen what they're doing and it isn't, it's an embarrassing growth.
[14:09.440 --> 14:11.680]  My girl looked like that. I would put matches to it.
[14:11.880 --> 14:15.040]  They should be ashamed of what they were producing when I saw the last footage in
[14:15.040 --> 14:15.680]  there.
[14:15.680 --> 14:18.560]  There's you can pull up some footage on YouTube,
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.480]  what a lot of it looks like. And when you listen to the researchers talk,
[14:22.480 --> 14:26.080]  they tell you, well, we can produce anything that's requested.
[14:26.080 --> 14:31.080]  We can mix a batch of 19% THC or 10% or 4% or 12% whatever you want.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.440]  And when you look at what he's talking about, he's basically like, well,
[14:34.440 --> 14:39.440]  we just grind up enough leaf and stem in there to bring the 21 down to 12 or the
[14:40.080 --> 14:44.400]  grind enough bud over the 4% until it's a 9% and it's, yeah,
[14:44.400 --> 14:45.240]  it's not pretty.
[14:45.320 --> 14:48.000]  I've seen their facility and I don't think they ever passed 15%.
[14:48.000 --> 14:48.680]  Um,
[14:48.680 --> 14:53.680]  the feds have run a medical marijuana program since 82 where patients get mailed
[14:55.560 --> 14:59.080]  11 ounces each of pre-rolled joints every month.
[14:59.600 --> 15:00.520]  And like a coffee can,
[15:00.520 --> 15:05.520]  a really cool coffee tin that's actually a bizarre collectible on the U S now
[15:05.520 --> 15:09.000]  because you can find them on eBay from time to time. Um,
[15:09.200 --> 15:11.800]  and one of the federal patients that does a lot of public speaking,
[15:11.800 --> 15:15.600]  we'll give them away for a charity events like silent auctions and stuff.
[15:15.600 --> 15:16.440]  But, uh,
[15:17.120 --> 15:17.560]  um,
[15:17.560 --> 15:22.560]  the marijuana that those patients get is from this farm and some of the video
[15:23.560 --> 15:23.880]  of it,
[15:23.880 --> 15:27.920]  especially that was taken at like conferences in the late nineties and early
[15:28.040 --> 15:28.880]  thousands.
[15:29.080 --> 15:31.000]  The quality is just atrocious.
[15:31.680 --> 15:34.040]  Like they have to unroll the pre-rolled joints,
[15:34.400 --> 15:36.160]  rehydrated in the fridge,
[15:36.200 --> 15:40.960]  like old hippie style with a piece of lettuce or a piece of bread to bring the
[15:40.960 --> 15:43.360]  moisture content up real quick and then reroll it.
[15:44.040 --> 15:46.080]  It's like Mexican brick weed from America.
[15:46.320 --> 15:47.160]  Yep.
[15:48.160 --> 15:49.000]  Why don't they,
[15:49.000 --> 15:49.400]  yeah,
[15:49.400 --> 15:50.480]  they need to hire somebody that,
[15:50.480 --> 15:51.480]  Hey guys in Mississippi,
[15:51.480 --> 15:51.960]  hire me.
[15:51.960 --> 15:52.800]  I know how to grow cannabis.
[15:52.800 --> 15:53.440]  Let's do this.
[15:53.440 --> 15:54.280]  I'll help you out.
[15:54.280 --> 15:57.320]  It's gotten a lot better since a lot of that footage was taken.
[15:57.320 --> 15:58.640]  A lot of that footage was shot.
[15:58.680 --> 15:59.520]  I hope so.
[15:59.760 --> 15:59.800]  Um,
[15:59.800 --> 16:01.520]  did you see the CNN footage?
[16:01.520 --> 16:03.640]  Do you know it well enough to discuss quality from that?
[16:03.720 --> 16:05.400]  I think that's the footage that I saw.
[16:05.400 --> 16:06.440]  They walk into the room with like,
[16:06.440 --> 16:09.360]  it looks like a shitty led and they've got like a small hydro table and the
[16:09.360 --> 16:10.560]  plants just look sad.
[16:11.120 --> 16:11.440]  Um,
[16:11.440 --> 16:13.120]  the plants totally look sad.
[16:13.120 --> 16:13.840]  Yeah.
[16:13.840 --> 16:14.280]  Um,
[16:14.280 --> 16:18.240]  it's definitely not like a Colorado commercial production quality.
[16:18.600 --> 16:20.400]  It's definitely not home grow quality.
[16:20.640 --> 16:21.480]  Yeah.
[16:21.560 --> 16:21.840]  Yeah.
[16:21.840 --> 16:24.440]  Remember the guy we went to his house and he had those super stretchy plants with
[16:24.440 --> 16:25.440]  the UFO light above them.
[16:25.480 --> 16:26.480]  That's what it made me think of.
[16:26.480 --> 16:27.760]  You know who I'm talking about right away.
[16:27.760 --> 16:28.280]  Yeah.
[16:28.280 --> 16:29.560]  It reminded me of that dude's grow.
[16:29.560 --> 16:29.880]  I was like,
[16:29.880 --> 16:30.160]  Oh,
[16:30.160 --> 16:31.160]  that guy's growing over there.
[16:31.160 --> 16:31.880]  Shit.
[16:31.880 --> 16:32.040]  Yeah.
[16:32.040 --> 16:33.080]  Some struggle buds.
[16:33.360 --> 16:33.520]  Yeah.
[16:33.520 --> 16:35.120]  So they can't be very struggle,
[16:35.120 --> 16:35.960]  but it can't be very,
[16:36.120 --> 16:37.720]  very good quality by the looks of it.
[16:38.000 --> 16:38.480]  So there,
[16:38.480 --> 16:41.480]  the DEA claims that cannabis does not have a,
[16:41.520 --> 16:46.000]  a currently accepted medical use in the U S and there is a lack of accepted
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.720]  safety for its use under medical supervision and it has a high potential for
[16:50.720 --> 16:51.560]  abuse.
[16:51.760 --> 16:53.040]  All of that is bullshit.
[16:53.040 --> 16:53.440]  You guys,
[16:53.440 --> 16:53.640]  what,
[16:53.640 --> 16:54.280]  what,
[16:54.280 --> 16:54.800]  why aren't,
[16:54.800 --> 16:55.360]  why?
[16:55.360 --> 16:55.640]  Mike,
[16:55.640 --> 16:58.520]  why isn't the DEA smart enough to see that all of that is bullshit?
[16:59.360 --> 16:59.520]  Oh,
[16:59.520 --> 17:00.440]  they totally do.
[17:00.800 --> 17:01.400]  So what's their,
[17:01.400 --> 17:01.840]  what's their,
[17:01.840 --> 17:02.680]  it's not,
[17:02.720 --> 17:07.720]  it doesn't have anything to do with marijuana itself and everything to do with
[17:09.160 --> 17:10.280]  succeeding power.
[17:10.360 --> 17:11.200]  In my opinion,
[17:11.880 --> 17:15.960]  the marijuana being illegal is an amazingly powerful tool.
[17:16.040 --> 17:19.800]  It does several things that they want to keep happening.
[17:20.800 --> 17:22.000]  If they lose that stick,
[17:22.000 --> 17:22.880]  they lose a lot.
[17:23.640 --> 17:24.480]  Um,
[17:25.080 --> 17:27.320]  there are a lot of things that are built on that pyramid.
[17:27.320 --> 17:28.360]  They crumble after,
[17:29.280 --> 17:30.640]  is it the pharmaceutical industry?
[17:31.280 --> 17:31.800]  Um,
[17:31.800 --> 17:33.600]  there are definitely financial interests.
[17:33.600 --> 17:34.200]  Is it the prison?
[17:34.200 --> 17:35.320]  Is it the prison industry?
[17:35.360 --> 17:36.080]  Um,
[17:36.080 --> 17:38.200]  there's been some good reporting lately.
[17:38.200 --> 17:38.720]  Um,
[17:38.720 --> 17:41.280]  Washington or I don't remember which paper,
[17:41.280 --> 17:42.120]  but uh,
[17:42.360 --> 17:46.600]  looking at the major lobbying efforts recently against marijuana rescheduling
[17:46.600 --> 17:48.320]  against marijuana legalization.
[17:48.720 --> 17:51.240]  And a lot of that's coming from alcohol and pharmaceuticals,
[17:51.520 --> 17:52.200]  alcohol,
[17:52.200 --> 17:53.920]  pharmaceutical prisons.
[17:53.920 --> 17:54.320]  Okay.
[17:54.640 --> 17:54.800]  Well,
[17:54.800 --> 17:58.600]  there's a big report out recently that legal marijuana States and medical
[17:58.600 --> 18:02.680]  marijuana States saw huge reductions in Medicare and Medicaid prescription
[18:02.680 --> 18:03.280]  billing.
[18:03.280 --> 18:04.120]  Oh wow.
[18:04.160 --> 18:05.000]  Um,
[18:05.120 --> 18:10.120]  and it was in enough States and over the same timelines to draw causation
[18:11.280 --> 18:12.120]  conclusions.
[18:12.520 --> 18:12.920]  Um,
[18:12.920 --> 18:15.080]  not a one to one like mathematical,
[18:15.320 --> 18:16.000]  um,
[18:16.000 --> 18:16.800]  conclusion,
[18:16.800 --> 18:21.800]  but enough to infer that where people have easy free legal access to cannabis,
[18:22.800 --> 18:23.440]  um,
[18:23.440 --> 18:25.160]  they can just swing by a store and get it.
[18:25.160 --> 18:30.160]  Basically they consume significantly less prescription drugs and that's a huge
[18:30.480 --> 18:32.200]  loss to a major industry.
[18:32.560 --> 18:33.880]  Same thing with alcohol.
[18:33.960 --> 18:34.800]  Um,
[18:35.120 --> 18:39.880]  when 20 something males have a marijuana that they can go buy at a store,
[18:40.400 --> 18:40.840]  um,
[18:40.840 --> 18:43.200]  they consume significantly less alcohol.
[18:43.320 --> 18:44.160]  Honestly,
[18:44.280 --> 18:44.680]  um,
[18:44.680 --> 18:45.720]  my mic sounded really hot.
[18:45.720 --> 18:46.200]  Sorry.
[18:46.200 --> 18:46.760]  Honestly,
[18:46.760 --> 18:47.040]  when,
[18:47.040 --> 18:47.400]  uh,
[18:47.400 --> 18:49.480]  I got my first medical marijuana card,
[18:49.480 --> 18:51.880]  I told myself and my friends and my family,
[18:51.880 --> 18:52.120]  I was like,
[18:52.120 --> 18:52.520]  you know what?
[18:52.520 --> 18:54.160]  I can smoke all the cannabis I want.
[18:54.280 --> 18:55.440]  I'm going to quit drinking.
[18:55.880 --> 18:56.960]  And they're like bullshit.
[18:57.240 --> 18:59.120]  And here it is probably six,
[18:59.120 --> 18:59.680]  seven,
[18:59.680 --> 19:00.160]  eight years.
[19:00.160 --> 19:00.880]  Maybe later.
[19:00.880 --> 19:04.040]  I haven't drank since I started using medical cannabis since I was able to go
[19:04.040 --> 19:06.560]  to the dispensary and point at that jar and say,
[19:06.560 --> 19:10.720]  let me get an ounce of that tastiness right there and go home and roll up and
[19:10.720 --> 19:12.760]  puff down as hard as I want without any worries.
[19:12.960 --> 19:15.400]  Cause back in the day I didn't know where I was going to buy my next weed.
[19:15.400 --> 19:18.480]  You have to preserve that ounce cause you paid way too much and you don't know
[19:18.480 --> 19:19.920]  if that dude's going to have good weed or not.
[19:19.920 --> 19:20.760]  Next time.
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.400]  Now you can medicate as needed.
[19:22.440 --> 19:23.920]  I don't need to drink any alcohol.
[19:23.960 --> 19:25.160]  I don't like being drunk.
[19:25.160 --> 19:25.720]  I'm no good.
[19:25.720 --> 19:27.880]  I don't know if I'm really good at it or really bad at it.
[19:27.880 --> 19:28.720]  I'm not sure.
[19:28.840 --> 19:30.080]  I'm not sure what the case is,
[19:30.080 --> 19:31.680]  but I know that it's not my friend.
[19:32.080 --> 19:35.720]  I don't wake up hungover and regretful when I smoke cannabis.
[19:37.040 --> 19:38.600]  I've got a very similar story.
[19:38.600 --> 19:39.420]  It's not,
[19:39.840 --> 19:42.400]  I quit drinking before I had a medical marijuana card,
[19:42.400 --> 19:45.120]  but essentially the same thing is I got really good at drinking.
[19:46.520 --> 19:47.160]  Um,
[19:47.160 --> 19:49.680]  and I decided that I didn't like some of those character traits.
[19:49.680 --> 19:51.320]  So I was going to take a couple of days off,
[19:51.960 --> 19:53.320]  a couple of days became a week.
[19:53.320 --> 19:55.120]  And now it's been like eight years.
[19:55.680 --> 20:00.680]  Like I went to Mardi Gras two years ago and had three beers,
[20:01.760 --> 20:06.320]  like just like with dinners just because I was there and I was at sea level and
[20:06.320 --> 20:08.400]  I wouldn't feel the repercussions of it the next day.
[20:08.400 --> 20:09.160]  Like I would have had,
[20:09.160 --> 20:10.560]  I had three beers here.
[20:10.800 --> 20:11.720]  Is that where Davey happened,
[20:11.720 --> 20:12.160]  bro?
[20:12.160 --> 20:12.560]  No,
[20:12.560 --> 20:13.360]  we found out,
[20:13.360 --> 20:16.440]  we found out about Davey the day after we got to new Orleans.
[20:16.480 --> 20:16.760]  Oh,
[20:16.760 --> 20:19.080]  so the wife couldn't have any alcohol the whole time on the trip.
[20:19.080 --> 20:20.440]  That's sort of how we found out.
[20:20.520 --> 20:21.360]  Um,
[20:21.920 --> 20:22.360]  the,
[20:22.360 --> 20:23.400]  the day we got there,
[20:23.400 --> 20:23.720]  she,
[20:23.720 --> 20:27.080]  she took a sip out her first drink and got queasy and was like,
[20:27.080 --> 20:27.920]  man.
[20:28.160 --> 20:29.320]  And then the second day,
[20:29.360 --> 20:30.160]  same thing.
[20:30.160 --> 20:31.960]  And after the second day she was like,
[20:31.960 --> 20:32.800]  go to Walgreens.
[20:32.880 --> 20:33.560]  Oh,
[20:33.560 --> 20:34.280]  um,
[20:34.280 --> 20:34.960]  and yep.
[20:34.960 --> 20:37.600]  And so we were in new Orleans for 10 days and we found out we were,
[20:37.640 --> 20:38.920]  we were pregnant on the second day.
[20:38.960 --> 20:40.320]  You get to celebrate while you're there.
[20:40.440 --> 20:40.920]  Kind of.
[20:40.920 --> 20:41.360]  We did.
[20:41.360 --> 20:42.000]  It was a,
[20:42.000 --> 20:42.600]  it was great.
[20:42.600 --> 20:43.600]  We celebrated the whole time.
[20:43.600 --> 20:44.720]  We had a truckload of good food.
[20:44.720 --> 20:46.440]  Neither of us are real heavy drinkers anyway,
[20:46.440 --> 20:48.720]  so it's not like we're missing out on anything.
[20:48.720 --> 20:49.120]  Right.
[20:49.120 --> 20:49.640]  Yeah.
[20:49.640 --> 20:50.200]  Um,
[20:50.200 --> 20:50.640]  but yeah,
[20:50.640 --> 20:53.200]  I had a great time and I had a lot to celebrate,
[20:54.200 --> 20:54.760]  but yeah,
[20:54.760 --> 20:56.080]  I don't really drink.
[20:56.080 --> 20:57.320]  And a lot of it has to do with,
[20:57.320 --> 20:59.280]  I can relax and unwind with cannabis.
[21:00.000 --> 21:01.520]  And it's a much better unwind.
[21:02.000 --> 21:02.840]  There's no,
[21:03.080 --> 21:04.640]  there's no penalty the next day.
[21:05.520 --> 21:10.160]  And that's what I hated about drinking is the incredibly bad decisions I would
[21:10.160 --> 21:13.320]  make while drinking and then waking up the next day,
[21:13.360 --> 21:14.960]  getting home while you're drunk.
[21:15.440 --> 21:15.800]  Right.
[21:15.800 --> 21:17.440]  Just figuring out how to get home dry.
[21:17.440 --> 21:18.240]  Am I going to drive?
[21:18.240 --> 21:19.240]  Am I going to take a taxi?
[21:19.280 --> 21:21.440]  Am I going to jump in one of my drunk friends' cars?
[21:21.840 --> 21:22.600]  Uh,
[21:22.640 --> 21:23.560]  so many nights I,
[21:23.720 --> 21:24.240]  so many,
[21:24.240 --> 21:25.640]  so many mornings I've woken up saying,
[21:25.640 --> 21:28.480]  I am so thankful that I made it home last night.
[21:28.520 --> 21:30.400]  I talked to someone today who's like,
[21:30.400 --> 21:32.280]  I quit drinking this morning and it's like,
[21:34.520 --> 21:36.160]  I hear it a lot when you get to six months,
[21:36.160 --> 21:36.880]  holler.
[21:36.880 --> 21:37.720]  Yeah.
[21:37.880 --> 21:41.800]  So the point we're at here is people are consuming less cannabis or consuming
[21:41.840 --> 21:42.360]  less alcohol.
[21:42.360 --> 21:47.080]  They're consuming less pills because we are able to access cannabis safely.
[21:47.960 --> 21:48.800]  It's a,
[21:49.520 --> 21:50.160]  it's,
[21:50.160 --> 21:52.200]  there's a lot of people who don't want that to happen.
[21:52.240 --> 21:57.080]  And there's a lot of people who don't want to lose that lever of control on
[21:57.080 --> 21:57.920]  people.
[21:58.120 --> 21:58.560]  Um,
[21:58.560 --> 22:01.880]  it's an immediate excuse to get to further a car stop.
[22:02.600 --> 22:02.880]  Um,
[22:02.880 --> 22:03.920]  I smell marijuana.
[22:04.520 --> 22:04.880]  There's,
[22:04.880 --> 22:07.440]  there's not one video on YouTube where the cop goes,
[22:07.680 --> 22:08.600]  I smell heroin.
[22:08.640 --> 22:09.720]  I want to search your vehicle.
[22:10.160 --> 22:11.280]  I want to smoke cocaine.
[22:11.520 --> 22:12.440]  Or I smell cocaine.
[22:12.440 --> 22:13.400]  I want to search your vehicle.
[22:13.480 --> 22:13.880]  Right?
[22:13.880 --> 22:14.480]  Um,
[22:14.480 --> 22:15.840]  that video doesn't exist.
[22:15.840 --> 22:17.160]  It never gets said.
[22:17.160 --> 22:17.360]  I,
[22:17.360 --> 22:17.640]  I,
[22:17.640 --> 22:18.800]  I think I smell a gun.
[22:18.800 --> 22:19.920]  I want to search your vehicle.
[22:20.600 --> 22:21.080]  Um,
[22:21.080 --> 22:23.720]  I think I smell someone you're smuggling in your trunk.
[22:23.800 --> 22:24.720]  I want to search your vehicle.
[22:24.760 --> 22:25.280]  The,
[22:25.280 --> 22:26.520]  that video doesn't exist.
[22:26.680 --> 22:27.800]  Every single video is,
[22:27.800 --> 22:32.040]  I think I smell marijuana when that takes steps away.
[22:32.040 --> 22:34.360]  Everything for law enforcement gets a little bit harder.
[22:34.400 --> 22:36.800]  That is so true because I recently got pulled over.
[22:36.800 --> 22:37.920]  I talked about it on the show.
[22:38.080 --> 22:39.720]  And the first thing that cop said was,
[22:39.720 --> 22:41.360]  do you have any marijuana in the vehicle?
[22:42.160 --> 22:45.080]  And I had to reprogram my brain real quickly because first I was like,
[22:45.080 --> 22:45.240]  no,
[22:45.240 --> 22:45.440]  sir,
[22:45.440 --> 22:46.120]  there's no weed in here.
[22:46.120 --> 22:46.560]  But then I was like,
[22:46.560 --> 22:47.040]  wait a minute.
[22:47.040 --> 22:48.560]  That's 2016 bro.
[22:48.600 --> 22:49.720]  You've got your badge on,
[22:49.720 --> 22:51.160]  you've got your purple card in your pocket.
[22:51.160 --> 22:52.480]  And I looked him straight in the face and I go,
[22:52.840 --> 22:54.600]  it may be because I wasn't certain,
[22:54.800 --> 22:55.680]  but there may be,
[22:55.680 --> 22:56.560]  there could be weed in here.
[22:57.040 --> 22:57.360]  And he's like,
[22:57.360 --> 22:58.440]  it smells really strong.
[22:58.440 --> 22:58.760]  And I was like,
[22:58.760 --> 22:58.920]  Oh,
[22:58.920 --> 23:02.360]  I work at a grow and just being honest with them that changed everything.
[23:02.360 --> 23:03.640]  He had no problem to mess with me now.
[23:03.640 --> 23:04.040]  So you're right.
[23:04.040 --> 23:05.840]  That does take all the stress.
[23:05.840 --> 23:07.160]  I'm not a criminal anymore.
[23:07.320 --> 23:07.600]  Yep.
[23:07.640 --> 23:10.360]  The only thing I used to do wrong was have a bunch of weed in the car.
[23:10.400 --> 23:13.360]  Those first couple of law enforcement interactions are bizarre.
[23:14.080 --> 23:14.920]  Um,
[23:15.480 --> 23:15.720]  it,
[23:15.720 --> 23:16.160]  you,
[23:16.160 --> 23:20.000]  it's almost a genetic response with this community at this point.
[23:20.000 --> 23:20.440]  Right.
[23:20.520 --> 23:21.360]  Um,
[23:21.480 --> 23:25.760]  because if we admit to being part of the cannabis community or having cannabis or
[23:25.760 --> 23:27.040]  supporting it in any way,
[23:27.480 --> 23:30.120]  we subject ourselves to all sorts of horrible things.
[23:30.600 --> 23:31.160]  Um,
[23:31.160 --> 23:32.040]  and in Colorado,
[23:32.040 --> 23:33.120]  that's not true anymore.
[23:33.120 --> 23:35.360]  And as those realization sets in,
[23:35.360 --> 23:36.080]  it's awesome.
[23:36.360 --> 23:41.000]  Have you been to an event or a place where you have consumed cannabis near law
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.960]  enforcement and they've watched you many times before it was legal?
[23:45.120 --> 23:45.680]  Um,
[23:45.680 --> 23:46.080]  I,
[23:46.080 --> 23:46.600]  uh,
[23:46.600 --> 23:51.600]  I was up in Denver and Boulder during the heydays of the Boulder smoke out on
[23:51.720 --> 23:54.040]  four 20 in the civic center,
[23:54.080 --> 23:54.440]  um,
[23:54.440 --> 23:56.080]  gatherings on four 20 where,
[23:56.560 --> 23:56.920]  um,
[23:56.920 --> 23:59.880]  tens or hundreds of thousands of people get together all at once.
[23:59.920 --> 24:01.760]  Everybody lights up at the same time,
[24:02.120 --> 24:03.200]  sort of as a dare,
[24:03.520 --> 24:04.360]  go ahead.
[24:04.720 --> 24:07.320]  There's 10,000 of us arrest 11 of us.
[24:07.320 --> 24:08.080]  See what happens.
[24:08.120 --> 24:08.640]  Right.
[24:08.640 --> 24:09.120]  Um,
[24:09.120 --> 24:13.000]  like we're going to peacefully sit here and smoke pot and play bad music and
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.720]  then cheer at four 20 and all smoke pot together.
[24:15.720 --> 24:16.960]  And there'll be a big cloud.
[24:17.400 --> 24:19.520]  And by five o'clock we'll all be gone.
[24:20.360 --> 24:21.200]  Um,
[24:21.240 --> 24:23.680]  the shops in the area that sell food,
[24:23.680 --> 24:25.320]  we'll all make an extra five grand,
[24:25.320 --> 24:26.480]  10 grand that day.
[24:26.920 --> 24:27.880]  Everybody's happy.
[24:28.440 --> 24:28.800]  Um,
[24:28.800 --> 24:32.440]  everybody except people that have to take public transportation or commute during
[24:32.440 --> 24:33.280]  those hours.
[24:33.760 --> 24:34.600]  Anyway,
[24:34.880 --> 24:35.200]  but,
[24:35.200 --> 24:35.840]  uh,
[24:35.840 --> 24:37.600]  Uber drivers are making mad thing,
[24:37.600 --> 24:38.760]  downtown Denver.
[24:38.840 --> 24:39.240]  Um,
[24:39.240 --> 24:41.840]  a hundred thousand people just convene at civic center.
[24:42.400 --> 24:43.240]  Um,
[24:43.240 --> 24:43.560]  the,
[24:43.560 --> 24:45.720]  the cops stand by and they always had,
[24:46.200 --> 24:46.480]  um,
[24:46.480 --> 24:49.960]  and just kind of made sure everything was calm and collected and nobody got out
[24:49.960 --> 24:51.200]  of control and it was fine.
[24:52.160 --> 24:52.720]  Um,
[24:52.720 --> 24:53.040]  but,
[24:53.040 --> 24:53.440]  uh,
[24:53.440 --> 24:54.880]  at post legalization,
[24:54.880 --> 24:55.720]  only a few.
[24:55.840 --> 24:56.480]  Okay.
[24:56.480 --> 24:57.000]  It's just,
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.040]  I've been too busy.
[24:58.040 --> 24:59.760]  I always end up working those days.
[24:59.760 --> 25:01.320]  You're not the guy that goes to all the events.
[25:01.320 --> 25:02.200]  You're not that dude.
[25:02.440 --> 25:02.800]  There.
[25:02.800 --> 25:05.560]  I desperately want to go to like the next secret sesh.
[25:05.600 --> 25:08.000]  I need to get out and enjoy a few events now.
[25:08.360 --> 25:09.240]  August 27th.
[25:09.240 --> 25:11.240]  Now that Davy's a little bit older,
[25:11.240 --> 25:13.360]  I can start doing that a little bit easier.
[25:13.480 --> 25:14.320]  Yeah.
[25:14.680 --> 25:16.080]  He's going to be so much fun pretty soon.
[25:16.240 --> 25:20.560]  So I remember the first time we used to go to smoke nights at the cloud nine
[25:20.560 --> 25:21.720]  hookah bar here in Pueblo.
[25:21.720 --> 25:24.360]  I've talked about them on the podcast way back in the early episodes,
[25:24.360 --> 25:25.200]  cause that was back in the,
[25:25.240 --> 25:26.080]  in the day here.
[25:26.680 --> 25:26.920]  Uh,
[25:26.920 --> 25:29.520]  since then they've shut them down and we can't do that here in Pueblo anymore,
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.400]  but we were at the cloud nine hookah bar and I was sitting,
[25:32.920 --> 25:33.840]  I was at the bar,
[25:33.840 --> 25:34.240]  which is,
[25:34.240 --> 25:34.920]  it's an old bar,
[25:34.920 --> 25:36.120]  but it's now turned into a hookah bar,
[25:36.120 --> 25:37.120]  but they didn't change much.
[25:37.120 --> 25:37.280]  You know,
[25:37.280 --> 25:38.360]  it's still got the bar seating.
[25:38.360 --> 25:39.320]  They just put hookahs out.
[25:39.640 --> 25:43.000]  I was sitting at the bar and there was one person and then me.
[25:43.160 --> 25:45.440]  And in front of me is my little oil slick pad,
[25:45.440 --> 25:46.000]  my rig,
[25:46.000 --> 25:46.840]  my torch,
[25:46.960 --> 25:48.320]  my little variety of hash.
[25:48.320 --> 25:49.720]  I was hitting a bull or at a bull.
[25:49.720 --> 25:50.520]  I was in a bowl that night.
[25:50.520 --> 25:51.680]  I had a bowl of some flowers in it.
[25:51.680 --> 25:53.080]  I had a bag of weed next to me.
[25:53.680 --> 25:53.800]  Uh,
[25:53.800 --> 25:54.640]  and I was just chilling,
[25:54.640 --> 25:57.440]  just sitting on the bar stool and the cops walked in three of them together.
[25:57.760 --> 25:58.600]  And I heard the radio.
[25:58.600 --> 25:59.440]  You always hear the,
[26:00.120 --> 26:01.360]  and then they walk in and I was like,
[26:01.400 --> 26:01.720]  ah,
[26:01.720 --> 26:02.560]  what do I do?
[26:03.040 --> 26:03.880]  And I thought,
[26:04.280 --> 26:05.040]  fucking sit here,
[26:05.040 --> 26:05.280]  dude,
[26:05.280 --> 26:06.440]  you're a 21 year old.
[26:06.480 --> 26:07.480]  You're over 21.
[26:07.920 --> 26:09.720]  You've got a red card in your pocket or purple card.
[26:09.720 --> 26:10.560]  Now,
[26:10.640 --> 26:11.600]  cannabis is legal.
[26:11.840 --> 26:14.520]  The owner of this place is who's going to have to fucking deal with anything.
[26:14.520 --> 26:14.840]  Yep.
[26:14.840 --> 26:17.680]  Those cops walked right past me and they went and talked to the owner,
[26:17.680 --> 26:19.440]  the owner nodded and smiled a couple of times.
[26:19.440 --> 26:20.320]  They all shook hands.
[26:20.560 --> 26:22.600]  The cops walked past me and they kind of looked at my,
[26:22.600 --> 26:22.920]  uh,
[26:22.920 --> 26:24.200]  what I had sitting on the table.
[26:24.480 --> 26:26.400]  Like they looked at it more curiously.
[26:26.440 --> 26:26.800]  They were like,
[26:26.800 --> 26:27.160]  huh?
[26:27.160 --> 26:27.480]  Okay.
[26:27.480 --> 26:29.320]  That's what smoking hash supplies look like.
[26:29.600 --> 26:31.080]  And they walked past it and they nodded at me.
[26:31.080 --> 26:32.080]  And they kind of smiled like,
[26:32.080 --> 26:32.200]  Hey,
[26:32.200 --> 26:33.000]  what's up stoner.
[26:33.240 --> 26:35.080]  Like one of them kind of condescendingly smile.
[26:35.080 --> 26:35.560]  Like what's up?
[26:35.560 --> 26:36.760]  You weed head your highest fuck.
[26:36.760 --> 26:38.560]  And the other two just kind of nodded politely.
[26:38.920 --> 26:39.760]  They walked out.
[26:40.360 --> 26:41.760]  One of the kids that was there was younger,
[26:41.760 --> 26:42.600]  dude.
[26:42.600 --> 26:42.800]  Uh,
[26:42.800 --> 26:43.440]  just,
[26:43.440 --> 26:44.800]  just being a typical dude.
[26:44.800 --> 26:47.280]  I probably would have said the same thing fucking 15 years ago,
[26:47.280 --> 26:48.320]  but as soon as they got outside,
[26:48.320 --> 26:48.480]  he goes,
[26:48.480 --> 26:48.720]  man,
[26:48.720 --> 26:49.800]  fuck the police.
[26:50.280 --> 26:51.200]  And I looked at him and I was like,
[26:51.200 --> 26:51.800]  bro,
[26:51.800 --> 26:52.880]  unfuck those police.
[26:52.880 --> 26:54.920]  They didn't take my hash and we didn't go to jail.
[26:54.920 --> 26:57.480]  Cause you were the first motherfucker they saw when they walked in here.
[26:57.760 --> 26:59.040]  Like they didn't do anything.
[26:59.040 --> 26:59.520]  So yeah,
[26:59.520 --> 27:00.360]  it was like,
[27:00.360 --> 27:02.320]  I had to remind him like we didn't go to jail for that.
[27:02.320 --> 27:03.600]  It was like two years ago.
[27:03.640 --> 27:04.880]  They would have threw me on the floor.
[27:05.160 --> 27:06.680]  Like just for having that shit.
[27:07.280 --> 27:07.800]  And there are,
[27:07.800 --> 27:10.640]  there are a lot of people who don't want to give that out.
[27:11.040 --> 27:15.080]  And that's why you see things like the DEA make decisions like this.
[27:16.040 --> 27:16.680]  It's it's,
[27:16.680 --> 27:17.880]  it's just silly.
[27:18.440 --> 27:19.040]  It is silly.
[27:19.040 --> 27:19.880]  If they,
[27:19.880 --> 27:23.240]  if they would have rescheduled cannabis to a schedule two substance,
[27:23.240 --> 27:24.120]  what that would have mean,
[27:24.280 --> 27:28.120]  what that would have meant is it would have now been allowable for prescriptions by
[27:28.120 --> 27:29.800]  all medical doctors.
[27:29.800 --> 27:32.440]  So they'd be able to write you a prescription for cannabis basically.
[27:32.800 --> 27:33.040]  Well,
[27:33.040 --> 27:33.840]  and they'd also,
[27:33.840 --> 27:36.800]  it makes research significantly easier.
[27:37.400 --> 27:38.240]  Um,
[27:38.880 --> 27:39.400]  I mean,
[27:39.400 --> 27:43.520]  I hate to keep going back to CNN specials cause CNN is usually obnoxious as all
[27:43.520 --> 27:43.800]  hell,
[27:43.800 --> 27:46.720]  but their marijuana reporting that they've done has been spectacular.
[27:47.400 --> 27:48.240]  Um,
[27:48.760 --> 27:53.280]  it's easy to research cocaine in the U S because it's a schedule two drug.
[27:53.760 --> 27:54.600]  It's easy to,
[27:54.760 --> 27:57.520]  it's easy to research schedule two drugs because,
[27:57.560 --> 27:58.400]  um,
[27:58.600 --> 27:59.520]  they're scheduled to,
[27:59.520 --> 28:02.520]  if they're scheduled one significantly more red tape,
[28:02.600 --> 28:03.440]  right?
[28:03.440 --> 28:03.480]  Um,
[28:03.480 --> 28:03.760]  much,
[28:03.760 --> 28:05.280]  much harder to research.
[28:05.840 --> 28:06.400]  And it,
[28:06.400 --> 28:06.720]  I mean,
[28:06.720 --> 28:11.640]  it takes years of going through approval meetings and submitting paperwork years
[28:12.080 --> 28:14.040]  to just begin your study.
[28:14.600 --> 28:15.040]  Um,
[28:15.040 --> 28:17.200]  and then in studies take years to complete.
[28:17.200 --> 28:18.720]  They take more years to,
[28:18.760 --> 28:20.760]  to write the conclusions,
[28:20.760 --> 28:21.680]  examine the data,
[28:21.680 --> 28:22.520]  all of that,
[28:22.840 --> 28:24.640]  and then more years to publish.
[28:25.240 --> 28:29.480]  And when you add another decade of red tape at the beginning of all of that,
[28:29.560 --> 28:33.040]  marijuana research is something that's not going to happen until we're all men.
[28:33.760 --> 28:34.600]  And,
[28:35.240 --> 28:38.440]  that's because it's a schedule one drug and,
[28:38.520 --> 28:39.120]  uh,
[28:39.120 --> 28:41.040]  moving it to schedule two changes on that.
[28:41.720 --> 28:42.040]  Um,
[28:42.040 --> 28:45.080]  any competent researcher can submit the paperwork and,
[28:45.120 --> 28:47.520]  and within a relatively reasonable amount of time,
[28:47.520 --> 28:48.480]  begin researching.
[28:48.920 --> 28:50.600]  And none of those changes were made.
[28:51.080 --> 28:55.520]  And so even though they created more places to grow it in the selection of
[28:55.520 --> 28:56.840]  research grade cannabis,
[28:56.840 --> 28:58.680]  that's available to be researched,
[28:58.680 --> 29:00.000]  will be expanding,
[29:00.560 --> 29:01.040]  uh,
[29:01.040 --> 29:03.120]  access to that material won't be.
[29:03.720 --> 29:04.920]  And that's really unfortunate.
[29:05.720 --> 29:07.120]  And this is why I,
[29:07.120 --> 29:07.440]  I,
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.440]  I ran and tell people to vote because none of this shit changes until a,
[29:13.080 --> 29:15.920]  most of the people involved in this have gotten old and died.
[29:16.400 --> 29:20.480]  Like we just have to wait until the generation that's so tied to this,
[29:20.920 --> 29:21.360]  um,
[29:21.360 --> 29:23.520]  has seceded power to our generation.
[29:23.520 --> 29:25.360]  And it's just gonna take another couple of decades.
[29:26.040 --> 29:26.480]  Um,
[29:26.480 --> 29:27.560]  and in the meantime,
[29:27.600 --> 29:29.640]  we need more people in our generation,
[29:29.640 --> 29:30.680]  politically active.
[29:31.240 --> 29:36.200]  So many members of our community tuned out because if we spoke up about what we
[29:36.200 --> 29:36.800]  believed in,
[29:36.800 --> 29:37.600]  we went to jail.
[29:37.640 --> 29:38.400]  I was scared,
[29:38.400 --> 29:38.600]  dude.
[29:38.600 --> 29:39.160]  Back in the day,
[29:39.160 --> 29:39.640]  you would be like,
[29:39.640 --> 29:41.600]  come to these little city council meetings with me.
[29:41.600 --> 29:41.960]  And I was like,
[29:41.960 --> 29:42.800]  no,
[29:42.800 --> 29:43.080]  I'm,
[29:43.080 --> 29:43.880]  I grow.
[29:43.880 --> 29:44.480]  And that,
[29:44.480 --> 29:45.320]  that I'm scared.
[29:45.520 --> 29:45.760]  Well,
[29:45.760 --> 29:49.800]  and that's part of the reason I became the politically active one down here is
[29:49.800 --> 29:52.280]  because I didn't physically have the space to grow,
[29:52.880 --> 29:53.360]  um,
[29:53.360 --> 29:55.520]  or the money for the startup equipment.
[29:56.120 --> 29:57.280]  And so I didn't,
[29:57.520 --> 29:57.760]  like,
[29:57.760 --> 29:59.840]  go ahead and shove my ass of a warrant.
[30:00.760 --> 30:02.240]  You could search all 12 square feet.
[30:03.240 --> 30:04.960]  Start with the dirty laundry prick.
[30:05.400 --> 30:07.440]  Like I didn't care.
[30:07.440 --> 30:08.080]  I like,
[30:08.080 --> 30:09.440]  I could have cops show up.
[30:09.440 --> 30:13.120]  I could have cops pull me over and demand to search my car and I'd be okay.
[30:13.720 --> 30:14.560]  Um,
[30:14.720 --> 30:15.880]  most of the time.
[30:17.400 --> 30:17.800]  But,
[30:17.800 --> 30:18.400]  uh,
[30:18.400 --> 30:21.960]  I w I was able to risk it where a lot of other people in the community simply
[30:21.960 --> 30:23.680]  weren't in a position to do that.
[30:24.240 --> 30:24.840]  Um,
[30:24.840 --> 30:25.560]  but one of the,
[30:25.560 --> 30:30.560]  one of the really interesting things that I noticed when I spoke out is that
[30:30.760 --> 30:32.200]  it gives you a shield.
[30:33.240 --> 30:34.080]  Um,
[30:34.280 --> 30:37.960]  when you go to city council meeting reporters for the local paper there,
[30:37.960 --> 30:41.600]  if you live in a major city reporters for a major papers are there.
[30:42.200 --> 30:43.040]  Um,
[30:43.400 --> 30:48.280]  when the guy that comes down to city council or the County commissioner
[30:48.280 --> 30:51.840]  meetings and makes really coherent articulate arguments,
[30:52.320 --> 30:52.840]  um,
[30:52.840 --> 30:54.920]  in the appropriate manner and setting,
[30:55.240 --> 30:57.680]  form marijuana gets his house raided.
[30:58.000 --> 30:59.440]  They break a bunch of furniture,
[30:59.440 --> 31:00.120]  rough him up,
[31:00.120 --> 31:04.000]  shoot his dog and don't find anything that shit makes the front page of the
[31:04.000 --> 31:05.920]  Washington post every day for a week.
[31:06.880 --> 31:08.080]  And they know this.
[31:08.080 --> 31:09.120]  And so it doesn't happen.
[31:10.160 --> 31:11.000]  Um,
[31:11.080 --> 31:12.760]  and that's not universally true.
[31:12.760 --> 31:15.160]  It's not being granted immunity by a judge,
[31:15.480 --> 31:19.560]  but it does provide you a significant layer of protection because by becoming
[31:19.560 --> 31:20.600]  mildly public,
[31:21.080 --> 31:21.680]  um,
[31:21.680 --> 31:22.200]  you,
[31:22.200 --> 31:24.080]  you're granted some of that protection.
[31:24.240 --> 31:24.560]  Yep.
[31:24.680 --> 31:25.000]  All right.
[31:25.000 --> 31:26.280]  So the DEA failed you guys.
[31:26.320 --> 31:26.600]  That was,
[31:26.600 --> 31:27.720]  that was my point of that topic.
[31:28.040 --> 31:29.440]  I want to move on to another topic here,
[31:29.440 --> 31:29.640]  Mike,
[31:29.640 --> 31:32.600]  thanks for having a whole lot of info on that one for supporting me on that.
[31:32.600 --> 31:33.600]  Y'all just learned a lot.
[31:34.080 --> 31:35.240]  I rambled a lot,
[31:35.240 --> 31:35.920]  but you like it.
[31:35.920 --> 31:36.360]  Both,
[31:36.360 --> 31:37.180]  both happened.
[31:37.180 --> 31:38.020]  Uh,
[31:39.400 --> 31:40.240]  it is now Wednesday,
[31:40.240 --> 31:42.720]  August 17th as we were recording this at just past midnight.
[31:43.080 --> 31:43.440]  Uh,
[31:43.440 --> 31:45.040]  right now it is August 17th.
[31:45.040 --> 31:45.840]  Happy birthday,
[31:45.840 --> 31:46.280]  Gibbs,
[31:46.280 --> 31:46.520]  Gibbs.
[31:46.520 --> 31:47.680]  I don't know if you listen to this podcast,
[31:47.680 --> 31:47.800]  bro.
[31:47.800 --> 31:48.360]  I love you.
[31:48.360 --> 31:49.160]  It's great being your friend.
[31:49.160 --> 31:49.560]  I miss you.
[31:49.560 --> 31:50.480]  I wish we'd hang out more.
[31:50.600 --> 31:51.880]  I hope everything is going well for you.
[31:52.040 --> 31:53.400]  Happy fucking birthday.
[31:53.400 --> 31:54.240]  Giblet.
[31:54.560 --> 32:00.120]  Also today marks the anniversary of the first time that my friend Amanda and myself took dabs together.
[32:00.360 --> 32:02.440]  Amanda has been in Colorado for one year now.
[32:02.480 --> 32:02.840]  Amanda,
[32:02.840 --> 32:04.720]  I don't know what Colorado would be like without you.
[32:04.720 --> 32:05.840]  I'm so glad you showed up.
[32:06.360 --> 32:07.180]  Uh,
[32:07.280 --> 32:07.480]  yeah,
[32:07.480 --> 32:08.640]  fucking friends forever there,
[32:08.640 --> 32:08.960]  dude.
[32:08.960 --> 32:10.360]  Not to get all sappy on everybody,
[32:10.360 --> 32:11.160]  but some,
[32:11.160 --> 32:11.280]  uh,
[32:11.280 --> 32:12.200]  some landmarks to,
[32:12.200 --> 32:12.760]  to note.
[32:12.760 --> 32:14.280]  So shout out to Gibbs and Amanda.
[32:14.320 --> 32:14.880]  Love you guys.
[32:15.120 --> 32:16.200]  Glad you're on my roster.
[32:16.880 --> 32:17.160]  Um,
[32:17.160 --> 32:20.360]  I said I was going to bring an email to the table to read.
[32:20.520 --> 32:23.480]  I took a screenshot of it cause it's much easier than going and searching through shit.
[32:24.120 --> 32:25.720]  Let me read this message to you.
[32:25.720 --> 32:26.760]  I've got two of them.
[32:27.600 --> 32:29.160]  This one says,
[32:29.520 --> 32:29.680]  uh,
[32:29.680 --> 32:30.080]  first of all,
[32:30.080 --> 32:32.600]  he said sucks that a sucks about the granny podcast.
[32:32.600 --> 32:34.760]  He said you killed it with the emails though,
[32:34.760 --> 32:37.440]  and we love your updates on your genetics.
[32:37.440 --> 32:40.000]  I should give you guys a quick update on that cause I said I would do that.
[32:40.280 --> 32:40.720]  Uh,
[32:40.720 --> 32:41.480]  the male plant,
[32:41.480 --> 32:42.280]  we are now,
[32:42.480 --> 32:44.040]  the date is now the 17th.
[32:44.040 --> 32:45.680]  So we are now 14 days in you guys.
[32:45.680 --> 32:49.160]  The male plant just started sprinkling a little bit of pollen,
[32:49.600 --> 32:52.000]  little itty bitty bitty bits of pollen are coming out of them.
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.120]  The girls are just starting to go into full flower.
[32:54.120 --> 32:57.160]  You can see their Calix pistols are just going nuts right now.
[32:57.480 --> 32:59.840]  The stretch phase is in full fledge.
[33:00.160 --> 33:00.360]  Uh,
[33:00.360 --> 33:01.920]  they'll quit stretching in about a week.
[33:02.400 --> 33:05.480]  I'll let them get pollen in about seven to 10 days.
[33:05.480 --> 33:07.000]  I'll start getting a lot of pollen on them.
[33:07.080 --> 33:09.480]  I've got pollen in a jar for backup.
[33:09.520 --> 33:11.160]  I've also got that male thrown pollen.
[33:11.200 --> 33:12.760]  They're going to get pollinated.
[33:13.200 --> 33:14.160]  So they're looking great.
[33:14.160 --> 33:16.480]  Everything is going beautifully on the breeding project.
[33:16.480 --> 33:17.800]  Everything is on schedule.
[33:17.920 --> 33:19.920]  Not a whole lot to report other than the male.
[33:20.160 --> 33:23.080]  His balls are big and he's just barely starting to dump pollen.
[33:23.880 --> 33:24.920]  So this message says,
[33:24.920 --> 33:27.240]  I was wondering what you know about Fox tailing.
[33:27.240 --> 33:30.440]  I don't really understand what is happening and whether it's a good or bad
[33:30.440 --> 33:31.280]  thing.
[33:31.440 --> 33:31.480]  Uh,
[33:31.480 --> 33:32.160]  when it happens,
[33:32.160 --> 33:33.480]  maybe a good show topic.
[33:34.200 --> 33:35.680]  And I replied with great topic.
[33:35.920 --> 33:38.920]  So that was a message that actually came from a friend on Instagram.
[33:39.160 --> 33:40.480]  The email has been killer lately,
[33:40.560 --> 33:40.840]  right?
[33:40.840 --> 33:41.800]  I get a lot of topics,
[33:41.800 --> 33:43.880]  a lot of content from the people that are sending me emails.
[33:43.880 --> 33:44.880]  I really appreciate that.
[33:44.880 --> 33:45.920]  Send me your emails guys.
[33:45.920 --> 33:48.920]  Send them to me at grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[33:48.920 --> 33:52.360]  That's the easiest way to reach me grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[33:52.640 --> 33:52.840]  Uh,
[33:52.840 --> 33:55.400]  it's easier if I filter all the questions through that one channel,
[33:55.560 --> 33:57.120]  I'll read your questions wherever they come from,
[33:57.120 --> 33:57.480]  honestly,
[33:57.480 --> 33:58.320]  cause I know you're not,
[33:58.560 --> 33:58.680]  uh,
[33:58.680 --> 33:59.960]  some of us are friends on Instagram,
[33:59.960 --> 34:00.520]  on Twitter,
[34:00.520 --> 34:01.520]  on whatever,
[34:01.840 --> 34:02.080]  uh,
[34:02.080 --> 34:02.800]  wherever we're friends,
[34:02.800 --> 34:03.200]  I'll read it,
[34:03.200 --> 34:04.040]  but it's easier.
[34:04.040 --> 34:07.400]  You got more of a chance if you hit me at grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[34:07.440 --> 34:08.080]  Right?
[34:08.080 --> 34:10.040]  So this guy wants to know about Fox tailing.
[34:10.040 --> 34:11.760]  Fox tailing is when you're growing a bug,
[34:11.880 --> 34:15.560]  some buds and they start popping off like little Fox tails,
[34:15.560 --> 34:16.280]  a little fingers.
[34:16.280 --> 34:16.800]  They just get,
[34:16.800 --> 34:18.200]  they start spreading out a little bit.
[34:18.240 --> 34:20.720]  I call them Cheeto fingers to Cheeto fingers.
[34:20.720 --> 34:21.160]  Yeah.
[34:21.160 --> 34:21.520]  But yeah,
[34:21.520 --> 34:23.480]  Fox tails is the appropriate term.
[34:23.600 --> 34:25.320]  Some strains it's genetic.
[34:25.480 --> 34:25.880]  Uh,
[34:25.880 --> 34:27.520]  if the bud stays compact,
[34:27.640 --> 34:31.080]  if it's tight and it's doing what looks like a Fox tail,
[34:31.120 --> 34:33.760]  more like a crown that's genetic.
[34:34.120 --> 34:34.560]  If it's,
[34:34.560 --> 34:37.240]  if the bud is airy and you're getting Fox taily,
[34:37.520 --> 34:39.760]  that is most likely from too much heat.
[34:40.400 --> 34:41.600]  That's usually what that's from.
[34:41.600 --> 34:43.240]  Your plants are probably too hot.
[34:43.240 --> 34:45.400]  They're probably a little bit too close to the light.
[34:45.840 --> 34:47.680]  Also coming with that Fox tailing,
[34:47.680 --> 34:49.560]  you may see a little bit of taco leaf.
[34:50.040 --> 34:50.200]  Uh,
[34:50.200 --> 34:51.360]  your leaf will look healthy.
[34:51.360 --> 34:52.200]  It'll look cool.
[34:52.440 --> 34:53.640]  Except on the edges,
[34:53.760 --> 34:55.480]  it'll be folding up like a taco shell.
[34:55.480 --> 34:57.800]  Like you could just make a little taco out of your leaf right there.
[34:58.040 --> 35:00.120]  Both of those are visual descriptors.
[35:00.200 --> 35:00.520]  Yeah.
[35:00.520 --> 35:02.080]  And so if you're seeing both of those,
[35:02.080 --> 35:03.880]  it certainly is too hot in there.
[35:04.120 --> 35:04.440]  Um,
[35:04.440 --> 35:08.720]  I've seen it most often when we call it kissing the sky where the plants grow up
[35:08.720 --> 35:10.280]  into the light while they're in bloom.
[35:10.360 --> 35:10.800]  Yeah.
[35:10.920 --> 35:11.160]  That,
[35:11.160 --> 35:11.480]  that's,
[35:11.480 --> 35:13.800]  that's probably what's happening to this guy's poor plants.
[35:13.840 --> 35:14.360]  Yep.
[35:14.520 --> 35:14.800]  Um,
[35:14.800 --> 35:15.880]  if that's not the case,
[35:15.880 --> 35:17.720]  Fox tailing could be from too much humidity.
[35:17.720 --> 35:18.800]  They're trying to spread out.
[35:19.040 --> 35:21.360]  This is the grossest description I could give you,
[35:21.480 --> 35:22.720]  but it's completely accurate.
[35:22.720 --> 35:24.120]  Mike knows where I'm going with this.
[35:24.560 --> 35:24.800]  Uh,
[35:24.800 --> 35:26.800]  imagine you're in Las Vegas in the summer.
[35:26.800 --> 35:28.840]  It's like 114 degrees outside.
[35:29.360 --> 35:29.680]  Uh,
[35:30.160 --> 35:32.560]  your man junk tries to just move away from your body.
[35:33.280 --> 35:34.680]  These plants are doing the same thing.
[35:34.680 --> 35:35.320]  It's too hot.
[35:35.320 --> 35:36.360]  Your balls want to get away.
[35:36.360 --> 35:37.400]  These plants are too hot.
[35:37.400 --> 35:38.520]  They want to get away from each other.
[35:38.520 --> 35:39.360]  They're starting to sweat.
[35:39.360 --> 35:40.160]  They're getting funky.
[35:40.200 --> 35:41.600]  They're just trying to peel off of each other.
[35:41.600 --> 35:44.480]  So they're not getting sweaty and funky and compacted in there.
[35:44.640 --> 35:44.840]  Yep.
[35:45.080 --> 35:47.640]  The plant's just trying to make some air room for itself.
[35:47.640 --> 35:48.640]  So it's trying to get spongy.
[35:48.640 --> 35:49.920]  It's Fox tailing out a little bit.
[35:49.920 --> 35:50.920]  It's going to get fluffy.
[35:51.400 --> 35:51.560]  Uh,
[35:51.560 --> 35:52.000]  it's going to get,
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.280]  it's getting heat stressed is probably what's happening.
[35:54.440 --> 35:56.200]  Or you could be overfeeding it.
[35:56.280 --> 35:57.120]  That also could,
[35:57.280 --> 35:58.720]  could make Fox tailing happen.
[35:58.960 --> 35:59.160]  Yep.
[35:59.160 --> 36:00.360]  One of those three it's,
[36:00.400 --> 36:01.840]  it's nine times out of 10,
[36:01.840 --> 36:03.120]  your plant hit the light.
[36:03.360 --> 36:03.640]  Yeah.
[36:03.640 --> 36:04.080]  Um,
[36:04.080 --> 36:09.400]  some Jilly bean phenotypes like to make a crown shape Fox tail strawberry banana
[36:09.400 --> 36:12.960]  tangy likes to make some crown shape Fox tails tangy.
[36:13.280 --> 36:13.520]  Uh,
[36:13.520 --> 36:15.040]  I guess it's a lot of things crossed to that.
[36:15.040 --> 36:15.720]  Callio.
[36:16.080 --> 36:17.560]  It works with the lemon haze.
[36:17.560 --> 36:18.360]  Fino that did it.
[36:18.360 --> 36:20.120]  If it got within eight inches of the light,
[36:20.120 --> 36:20.800]  it was a bitch.
[36:20.840 --> 36:21.200]  Okay.
[36:21.520 --> 36:21.960]  All right.
[36:21.960 --> 36:22.720]  But it was,
[36:22.760 --> 36:23.640]  the plant would drip.
[36:24.440 --> 36:24.800]  Um,
[36:24.800 --> 36:27.760]  and so the grower wouldn't get rid of it because it would just literally when
[36:27.760 --> 36:28.440]  you were harvesting,
[36:28.440 --> 36:30.120]  it would just drip THC.
[36:30.160 --> 36:30.800]  It was insane.
[36:30.840 --> 36:31.440]  That's awesome.
[36:31.760 --> 36:32.920]  I think I know that plant.
[36:32.960 --> 36:33.760]  I know what you're talking about.
[36:33.800 --> 36:34.520]  The closer,
[36:34.520 --> 36:36.480]  if it got within 10 inches of the light,
[36:36.480 --> 36:37.920]  it would Fox tail like mad.
[36:38.040 --> 36:39.080]  So chances are bro,
[36:39.120 --> 36:41.000]  your plant is getting too close to the light.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.560]  It's a little bit too hot.
[36:42.880 --> 36:43.080]  Uh,
[36:43.080 --> 36:43.440]  if that,
[36:43.440 --> 36:44.800]  if that's not the case,
[36:44.880 --> 36:47.720]  send me a follow up message and we'll figure out what's going on.
[36:47.720 --> 36:49.360]  We'll talk about it on a future episode.
[36:49.600 --> 36:51.480]  I truly do appreciate the interaction with my listeners.
[36:51.480 --> 36:53.440]  Send me more questions,
[36:53.440 --> 36:54.160]  more messages.
[36:54.160 --> 36:54.560]  I love it.
[36:54.560 --> 36:54.920]  You guys,
[36:54.920 --> 36:56.440]  I like it a lot.
[36:56.640 --> 36:56.800]  All right.
[36:56.800 --> 36:58.080]  I want to read one more email.
[36:58.160 --> 36:59.440]  This one's going to be quick.
[36:59.520 --> 37:00.640]  I'm finding it on my phone here.
[37:00.640 --> 37:01.920]  I did take another screenshot.
[37:02.320 --> 37:02.960]  This one says,
[37:02.960 --> 37:03.120]  Hey,
[37:03.120 --> 37:06.600]  I was listening to the podcast today and I heard you answer my questions on the
[37:06.600 --> 37:06.840]  air.
[37:06.840 --> 37:08.600]  This one's from Mazda 420 by the way.
[37:08.920 --> 37:09.960]  And he said it was a trip.
[37:10.000 --> 37:10.520]  And then he said,
[37:10.520 --> 37:11.120]  thanks for that,
[37:11.120 --> 37:11.440]  bro.
[37:11.800 --> 37:13.120]  When I say I work with robots,
[37:13.120 --> 37:14.680]  I just meant they act like robots.
[37:14.680 --> 37:15.520]  Cause remember I asked,
[37:15.640 --> 37:16.040]  I asked,
[37:16.040 --> 37:16.280]  I was like,
[37:16.280 --> 37:17.000]  are they real robots?
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.120]  Or there's people that act like robots.
[37:18.400 --> 37:18.880]  And then he said,
[37:18.880 --> 37:20.280]  I kind of like office space,
[37:20.280 --> 37:20.840]  but different.
[37:20.840 --> 37:21.080]  He said,
[37:21.080 --> 37:22.360]  I got another question for the show.
[37:22.360 --> 37:24.560]  I was hoping you could shine some light on.
[37:25.120 --> 37:26.240]  Then it says show questions.
[37:26.240 --> 37:26.720]  Number one,
[37:26.720 --> 37:28.720]  what are your thoughts on monster cropping?
[37:28.720 --> 37:29.200]  And then he said,
[37:29.200 --> 37:30.160]  I read that.
[37:30.160 --> 37:32.080]  It's great to use for Scrogg.
[37:32.120 --> 37:32.480]  Honest.
[37:32.480 --> 37:34.120]  I don't know a lot about monster cropping.
[37:34.360 --> 37:37.200]  All you got to do is send me another message and tell me what monster cropping
[37:37.280 --> 37:38.120]  is.
[37:38.360 --> 37:39.640]  And I'll tell you my opinions on it.
[37:39.760 --> 37:40.520]  I'll learn about it.
[37:40.560 --> 37:41.760]  Just tell me what's going on there.
[37:42.080 --> 37:43.560]  I don't know what you mean by monster cropping.
[37:43.560 --> 37:46.080]  There's a couple of things that could mean you can be by like snapping the
[37:46.080 --> 37:47.120]  stems and bending them.
[37:47.600 --> 37:47.800]  Uh,
[37:47.800 --> 37:48.640]  if that's what you mean,
[37:48.880 --> 37:49.320]  that's cool,
[37:49.320 --> 37:51.400]  but it takes too long for my type of growth.
[37:52.040 --> 37:52.400]  Uh,
[37:52.400 --> 37:53.320]  number two question.
[37:53.320 --> 37:53.880]  He said,
[37:53.880 --> 37:56.440]  I was curious to hear your thoughts on leds,
[37:56.440 --> 37:57.920]  any experience using one.
[37:58.360 --> 38:00.560]  I don't have any personal experience with leds,
[38:00.560 --> 38:01.800]  so I don't have a lot to tell you.
[38:01.800 --> 38:02.120]  I tell you,
[38:02.120 --> 38:05.800]  I can tell you that it changes the way your plants function.
[38:05.840 --> 38:06.640]  They've used,
[38:06.840 --> 38:07.440]  they do everything.
[38:07.440 --> 38:09.160]  They use their nutrients differently.
[38:09.240 --> 38:10.400]  They drink differently.
[38:10.840 --> 38:11.040]  Uh,
[38:11.040 --> 38:16.240]  I've seen friends run side by sides with leds and HPS lights and the led
[38:16.240 --> 38:20.040]  plants and the HPS lights looked completely different being fed the same thing.
[38:20.280 --> 38:21.880]  They photosynthesize differently.
[38:21.880 --> 38:23.360]  They want different nutrients.
[38:23.600 --> 38:25.200]  It's a whole new thing to learn.
[38:25.200 --> 38:27.000]  I don't have any experience with it personally.
[38:27.200 --> 38:29.440]  I can't guide you on any lights to use.
[38:29.640 --> 38:30.640]  I don't know enough.
[38:30.960 --> 38:31.320]  Uh,
[38:31.320 --> 38:36.040]  spend a lot of time researching light spectrums and their effects on
[38:36.040 --> 38:36.680]  plants.
[38:36.720 --> 38:37.720]  And yeah,
[38:37.720 --> 38:38.600]  that'll answer some of that.
[38:38.600 --> 38:43.120]  I've only seen them really successfully regularly used as auxiliary color
[38:43.120 --> 38:43.960]  augmentation.
[38:44.560 --> 38:45.040]  Um,
[38:45.040 --> 38:46.760]  when they're a primary light source,
[38:46.800 --> 38:47.320]  the,
[38:47.320 --> 38:49.760]  every harvest I've seen has been minuscule.
[38:49.840 --> 38:50.840]  I'll give a shout out to my friend,
[38:50.840 --> 38:51.600]  Nancy Budwell.
[38:51.600 --> 38:55.920]  She grows with a very specific brand of led lights and she kills it.
[38:55.920 --> 38:57.520]  Her plants are gorgeous.
[38:57.600 --> 38:58.160]  Um,
[38:58.160 --> 38:58.360]  yeah,
[38:58.360 --> 39:01.640]  but I've only ever seen the cheaper ones in action.
[39:01.840 --> 39:02.120]  Um,
[39:02.120 --> 39:04.840]  I've never seen like the $1,800 version.
[39:04.840 --> 39:07.360]  The lights that the Nancy are using,
[39:07.360 --> 39:08.560]  those lights are quite expensive.
[39:08.560 --> 39:10.320]  They're thousand to $1,400 lights.
[39:10.520 --> 39:10.760]  Um,
[39:10.760 --> 39:13.360]  but leds can be extremely expensive,
[39:13.360 --> 39:16.680]  but allegedly you pay for it in the first year and electrical savings,
[39:16.680 --> 39:17.000]  right?
[39:17.000 --> 39:17.920]  What you're going to save.
[39:17.920 --> 39:18.120]  Yeah.
[39:18.120 --> 39:20.600]  You got to throw it down on the table to walk out with that light,
[39:20.600 --> 39:22.880]  but you're not going to have to pay the electric bill every month.
[39:22.880 --> 39:26.440]  Like I do with my HPS lights and you don't have to run as much electricity on
[39:26.440 --> 39:27.800]  an air conditioner to cool it off.
[39:27.800 --> 39:28.240]  Also.
[39:28.240 --> 39:28.520]  Yep.
[39:28.520 --> 39:29.000]  There's a,
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.880]  there are advantages saving there.
[39:30.880 --> 39:31.400]  It's just,
[39:31.400 --> 39:34.240]  I've never seen them effectively used alone.
[39:34.640 --> 39:37.640]  Check out a Nancy Budwell on Facebook or Instagram.
[39:37.760 --> 39:42.360]  And she is a representative for a specific lighting company and she has great
[39:42.360 --> 39:45.480]  pictures and she will guide you through your purchase of an led light.
[39:45.480 --> 39:47.200]  If it's something that you're really interested in.
[39:47.760 --> 39:47.880]  Uh,
[39:47.880 --> 39:49.320]  he's got a third part to this question.
[39:49.760 --> 39:49.920]  Uh,
[39:49.920 --> 39:53.200]  it says also wondering what are your thoughts on hempy buckets and deep water
[39:53.200 --> 39:53.720]  culture?
[39:53.720 --> 39:56.400]  What are the pros and cons and your likes and dislikes?
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.080]  I am not super experienced in deep water culture.
[40:00.280 --> 40:01.760]  Do you remember our friend from Hawaii?
[40:02.240 --> 40:05.880]  That dude grew some deep water culture buckets and did some great work.
[40:06.040 --> 40:08.080]  The problem was if something goes wrong,
[40:08.080 --> 40:09.160]  everything goes wrong.
[40:09.160 --> 40:12.880]  If your pump goes out on that deep water culture pump and you don't spray for
[40:12.880 --> 40:13.680]  three or four hours,
[40:13.680 --> 40:14.520]  if it quits brand,
[40:15.080 --> 40:15.240]  uh,
[40:15.240 --> 40:15.760]  all your,
[40:15.760 --> 40:16.640]  your plants are going to die.
[40:16.880 --> 40:19.120]  That's the major dislike to it.
[40:19.640 --> 40:20.360]  Uh,
[40:20.360 --> 40:21.360]  I thought it was awesome.
[40:21.360 --> 40:24.720]  Our buddy had five gallon deep water culture buckets and his plants were taller
[40:24.720 --> 40:27.520]  than me and I'm six foot five and they were putting on weight.
[40:27.720 --> 40:28.760]  They were packing it up.
[40:29.240 --> 40:29.360]  Uh,
[40:29.360 --> 40:32.440]  the only problem is he had a lot of fungus gnats all the damn time.
[40:32.440 --> 40:34.400]  He could not get rid of the fungus gnats.
[40:34.800 --> 40:36.040]  I've never done it myself,
[40:36.040 --> 40:37.280]  so I don't have a lot of experience,
[40:37.280 --> 40:39.840]  but that's what our Hawaiian friend was experiencing from what I saw.
[40:40.120 --> 40:45.120]  I spent a lot of time researching different growth methods and this one scares
[40:45.200 --> 40:46.880]  me because of its complexity.
[40:46.880 --> 40:48.320]  It's the same thing with hydro.
[40:48.320 --> 40:49.960]  The more complicated it gets,
[40:50.480 --> 40:55.480]  the more random things might fail and cause your crop to suicide when you were
[40:55.760 --> 40:56.920]  only gone for six hours.
[40:56.920 --> 40:58.040]  That's why I'm a soil grower.
[40:58.240 --> 40:58.440]  Yep.
[40:58.440 --> 40:59.120]  And honestly,
[40:59.120 --> 41:04.120]  soil is insanely forgiving and part of the reasons for that are what make me
[41:04.440 --> 41:05.280]  favorite.
[41:05.280 --> 41:07.560]  So let's talk about deep water culture a little bit because there might be
[41:07.560 --> 41:08.400]  people out there going,
[41:08.400 --> 41:09.680]  what the hell's deep water culture?
[41:10.160 --> 41:13.760]  Basically deep water culture is a five gallon bucket and this is just a one.
[41:13.760 --> 41:16.880]  You can do multiple site deep water culture buckets and you can have a main
[41:16.880 --> 41:19.720]  bucket that feeds or a main reservoir that feeds multiple buckets.
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.160]  But for a one plant deep water culture bucket,
[41:23.160 --> 41:26.760]  you've got a five gallon bucket and then there's a lid type device that goes on
[41:26.760 --> 41:27.400]  top of the bucket,
[41:27.400 --> 41:30.920]  but it's got a little mesh basket cut out of the center of it and you fill that
[41:30.920 --> 41:33.760]  area with rockwool cubes and you put a,
[41:33.760 --> 41:34.320]  not rockwool,
[41:34.320 --> 41:36.600]  the a hydrotone clay balls and clay balls.
[41:36.600 --> 41:37.320]  Then you put your rock,
[41:37.320 --> 41:38.320]  your clone that's in a rock.
[41:38.320 --> 41:41.640]  Will you just set it in there and then it'll root and the roots will hang down
[41:41.640 --> 41:43.880]  inside of that five gallon bucket.
[41:43.920 --> 41:45.480]  Inside that five gallon bucket,
[41:46.040 --> 41:47.160]  you put a sprayer.
[41:47.440 --> 41:49.360]  There are a lot of different types of sprayers available.
[41:49.360 --> 41:50.760]  There are so many different ways to do it.
[41:50.920 --> 41:52.120]  They sell a circular,
[41:52.120 --> 41:55.680]  it's a circle sprayer that's got spray jets that shoot straight up and it's
[41:55.680 --> 41:56.440]  kind of a Mr.
[41:56.440 --> 41:57.280]  Type thing.
[41:57.440 --> 41:58.680]  So you're misting the bottom.
[41:59.680 --> 42:02.320]  A long growth version of the auto cloner.
[42:02.320 --> 42:02.480]  Yeah.
[42:02.600 --> 42:05.160]  It's a real big easy cloner is basically what it is.
[42:05.160 --> 42:09.160]  You want to miss those roots from the bottom real heavily and you put nutrients
[42:09.160 --> 42:11.280]  in the water and a lot of oxygen,
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.680]  heavily oxygenated and nutriented water spraying from the bottom so that those
[42:15.680 --> 42:18.680]  roots hang down into that and grow into that spring water.
[42:18.680 --> 42:20.280]  Cause gravity makes the roots want to go down.
[42:20.280 --> 42:21.080]  I think gravity does.
[42:21.080 --> 42:22.840]  I don't know if they just want to go down or if it's gravity,
[42:23.360 --> 42:24.720]  they may just want to do it naturally.
[42:25.040 --> 42:27.160]  But so the water spraying up onto there and it's growing.
[42:27.480 --> 42:30.720]  And then I put her on a timer so that it stops every once in a while.
[42:30.720 --> 42:34.320]  So the roots can kind of dry so that they don't rot and then you just keep it
[42:34.320 --> 42:34.760]  cycling.
[42:34.760 --> 42:35.920]  So every like 15 minutes,
[42:35.920 --> 42:39.400]  every 45 minutes it shuts off for 15 that lets your water cool down so that the
[42:39.400 --> 42:40.800]  pump doesn't overheat your water.
[42:41.200 --> 42:41.560]  Uh,
[42:41.560 --> 42:44.600]  cause the oxygen pump and the fucking moving it pump is going to make that water
[42:44.600 --> 42:44.800]  hot.
[42:44.800 --> 42:47.200]  A lot of people throw a chiller in there to keep that water cool.
[42:47.800 --> 42:48.480]  Uh,
[42:48.480 --> 42:49.320]  it's a lot of work.
[42:49.320 --> 42:52.200]  It's a lot of technology and if one piece of all that tech goes wrong,
[42:52.200 --> 42:53.600]  your whole thing could die.
[42:53.600 --> 42:53.920]  Yep.
[42:54.120 --> 42:54.400]  Um,
[42:54.400 --> 42:55.800]  the production is amazing.
[42:56.040 --> 42:56.600]  It's a,
[42:56.600 --> 42:59.520]  the plant seems to really love it when everything's humming.
[42:59.520 --> 43:01.120]  But it's one of those things where,
[43:01.640 --> 43:02.080]  um,
[43:02.080 --> 43:03.600]  if you're setting it up the one,
[43:03.640 --> 43:05.560]  the one bucket version on the cheap,
[43:06.160 --> 43:08.040]  like that's the quality of the parts.
[43:08.040 --> 43:10.520]  You just require constant attention.
[43:11.080 --> 43:11.400]  Um,
[43:11.400 --> 43:14.880]  and you have to understand that you like your plants got a gun to its head and
[43:14.880 --> 43:15.720]  the hammer's cocked.
[43:16.760 --> 43:21.200]  One piece fails and that trigger gets pulled and you start over period.
[43:21.440 --> 43:21.920]  Um,
[43:21.920 --> 43:22.880]  and that's why I,
[43:22.880 --> 43:24.720]  I read that far in the book.
[43:24.720 --> 43:25.280]  It was like,
[43:25.280 --> 43:27.960]  I know enough next chapter.
[43:28.840 --> 43:29.480]  So Mazar,
[43:29.480 --> 43:31.000]  I know I couldn't answer a lot of your questions,
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.280]  but at least I kind of gave you the answers that I had.
[43:33.440 --> 43:35.320]  I don't know a lot about monster cropping.
[43:35.320 --> 43:36.160]  Tell me what your,
[43:36.160 --> 43:37.840]  you think monster cropping means.
[43:37.840 --> 43:38.640]  Cause if you Google it,
[43:38.640 --> 43:40.840]  there are several different takes just cause it's a,
[43:41.080 --> 43:42.120]  that's a very common word.
[43:42.120 --> 43:43.120]  So let me know what you're thinking.
[43:43.440 --> 43:44.600]  I'll talk more about that.
[43:44.760 --> 43:45.600]  LEDs,
[43:45.600 --> 43:46.280]  no experience,
[43:46.280 --> 43:46.440]  dude.
[43:46.440 --> 43:47.800]  I told you what I saw from my friends,
[43:47.800 --> 43:48.640]  deepwater culture.
[43:48.920 --> 43:50.960]  We ranted on what I saw from my buddy,
[43:50.960 --> 43:52.480]  a golden pineapple express.
[43:52.480 --> 43:53.320]  Cause he's from Hawaii.
[43:53.640 --> 43:54.680]  That's what I used to come all the time.
[43:54.680 --> 43:55.160]  But,
[43:55.160 --> 43:55.360]  uh,
[43:55.360 --> 43:56.160]  Mazar four 20.
[43:56.160 --> 43:56.880]  Thanks for the email.
[43:56.880 --> 43:58.200]  Please send me more emails.
[43:58.360 --> 44:01.960]  We will talk more about this stuff on a future episode.
[44:03.640 --> 44:03.960]  Yeah,
[44:03.960 --> 44:04.800]  we will.
[44:04.960 --> 44:06.360]  I looked up at Mike and he was just blank.
[44:06.360 --> 44:07.400]  He was staring into the mic.
[44:07.400 --> 44:07.640]  No,
[44:07.640 --> 44:08.800]  the rigs looking at me.
[44:08.920 --> 44:09.680]  Do you need a dab?
[44:09.680 --> 44:10.960]  You want to take some dabs on the show?
[44:11.000 --> 44:11.400]  I,
[44:11.400 --> 44:11.600]  uh,
[44:11.600 --> 44:12.760]  I did already.
[44:12.760 --> 44:14.800]  And I think I'm probably still good.
[44:14.840 --> 44:17.920]  I'm going to dab the rest of what is on this parchment paper.
[44:17.920 --> 44:22.560]  This is some pineapple Jack from our friends at Turpex by last quarter gram.
[44:22.640 --> 44:22.800]  Yeah,
[44:22.800 --> 44:24.640]  it's probably quarter gram,
[44:24.640 --> 44:25.720]  but I'm going to take this.
[44:25.720 --> 44:26.360]  And then I think,
[44:26.360 --> 44:27.200]  uh,
[44:27.520 --> 44:29.080]  they want to wrap up the show after that.
[44:29.080 --> 44:29.920]  Mike got anything,
[44:29.960 --> 44:30.120]  uh,
[44:30.120 --> 44:31.080]  poignant to say,
[44:31.840 --> 44:32.320]  um,
[44:32.320 --> 44:32.840]  just,
[44:32.840 --> 44:33.080]  uh,
[44:33.080 --> 44:34.400]  we're gearing up for November.
[44:34.400 --> 44:35.160]  Make sure,
[44:35.160 --> 44:35.440]  uh,
[44:35.440 --> 44:36.480]  you can do it online.
[44:36.480 --> 44:38.600]  Most places make sure you're registered to vote.
[44:39.160 --> 44:39.440]  Uh,
[44:39.440 --> 44:42.880]  make sure you know what election issues are coming up in your area.
[44:43.320 --> 44:46.000]  Take a minute to actually research them.
[44:46.400 --> 44:48.000]  It's going to be a hell of election.
[44:48.040 --> 44:51.800]  All the news is focused on the circus that is the presidential race.
[44:52.400 --> 44:53.000]  Um,
[44:53.000 --> 44:53.840]  and honestly,
[44:53.840 --> 44:54.960]  it's the local stuff.
[44:54.960 --> 44:55.520]  That really,
[44:55.520 --> 44:55.880]  really,
[44:55.880 --> 44:56.680]  really matters.
[44:56.680 --> 44:59.560]  That's the stuff that's really going to impact your day to day.
[45:00.160 --> 45:00.720]  Um,
[45:00.720 --> 45:02.440]  and that's the place you say today.
[45:02.560 --> 45:03.400]  I did.
[45:03.560 --> 45:04.400]  And that's,
[45:04.800 --> 45:07.000]  that's the local issue stuff or the,
[45:07.040 --> 45:10.360]  the things that tend to really matter to most people.
[45:10.800 --> 45:11.160]  Um,
[45:11.160 --> 45:13.080]  take a minute to figure out what those are.
[45:13.560 --> 45:14.160]  Um,
[45:14.160 --> 45:16.160]  the local issues are now set.
[45:17.400 --> 45:21.040]  County voters will be voting on one marijuana question,
[45:21.040 --> 45:22.960]  whether or not they want to ban the industry.
[45:23.320 --> 45:26.600]  City voters will be voting on three marijuana questions.
[45:27.000 --> 45:27.880]  The first one,
[45:27.880 --> 45:29.560]  do you want to ban the rec industry?
[45:29.560 --> 45:30.400]  Yes or no.
[45:30.760 --> 45:32.000]  The second question,
[45:32.280 --> 45:34.440]  do you want to allow recreational stores?
[45:34.440 --> 45:35.280]  Yes or no.
[45:35.680 --> 45:36.840]  And the third question,
[45:36.840 --> 45:40.240]  do you want to tax those stores that like four and a half percent?
[45:40.880 --> 45:41.720]  Um,
[45:42.960 --> 45:44.680]  kind of a confusing set of questions.
[45:44.720 --> 45:45.040]  Um,
[45:45.040 --> 45:46.360]  and there's reasons for that.
[45:46.360 --> 45:50.800]  Like a lot of complicated reasons for all of those three questions appearing
[45:50.800 --> 45:52.200]  in front of public city voters.
[45:52.200 --> 45:52.520]  But,
[45:52.520 --> 45:53.360]  uh,
[45:53.400 --> 45:53.800]  um,
[45:53.800 --> 45:55.200]  you need to know which questions,
[45:55.200 --> 45:56.760]  which you need to know the wording,
[45:57.280 --> 45:57.600]  um,
[45:57.600 --> 46:00.160]  so that you don't accidentally vote the wrong way.
[46:01.160 --> 46:02.000]  Um,
[46:02.160 --> 46:05.760]  and it's important that you know that stuff regardless of whether you live near
[46:05.760 --> 46:06.600]  me or not.
[46:06.800 --> 46:06.840]  Um,
[46:06.840 --> 46:08.960]  because whatever the issues are in your area,
[46:08.960 --> 46:10.680]  they will impact you personally.
[46:11.360 --> 46:13.400]  Make sure you know what's up and make sure you vote.
[46:13.560 --> 46:15.080]  Have you gone to your Facebook page,
[46:15.080 --> 46:16.760]  your Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws,
[46:16.760 --> 46:21.240]  Facebook page and kind of typed in guidance on which way to vote since it is
[46:21.240 --> 46:22.200]  worded awkwardly.
[46:22.560 --> 46:22.960]  Uh,
[46:22.960 --> 46:26.240]  there's a already a beautiful infographic that helps with that,
[46:26.240 --> 46:26.440]  that,
[46:26.440 --> 46:26.600]  uh,
[46:26.600 --> 46:27.760]  the Pueblo Pope did,
[46:27.800 --> 46:29.680]  they've been doing some amazing cannabis.
[46:30.040 --> 46:31.000]  John Rodriguez,
[46:31.560 --> 46:32.400]  um,
[46:32.400 --> 46:33.240]  Lisa Wheeler.
[46:33.240 --> 46:35.760]  And I don't know the other reporters name.
[46:35.800 --> 46:36.640]  Okay.
[46:36.920 --> 46:40.160]  I've been doing Lisa Wheeler and your colleague who are helping us out in the
[46:40.160 --> 46:41.000]  cannabis fight.
[46:41.600 --> 46:42.440]  Um,
[46:42.560 --> 46:44.760]  not so much that as just doing solid,
[46:44.760 --> 46:45.680]  honest reporting.
[46:45.680 --> 46:46.840]  And when that's done,
[46:46.880 --> 46:51.880]  it leans far to the pro cannabis side because that's just the reality.
[46:51.880 --> 46:55.640]  You can't be a good reporter and not end up reporting that truth.
[46:56.240 --> 46:56.720]  Um,
[46:56.720 --> 46:57.080]  but,
[46:57.080 --> 46:57.920]  uh,
[46:57.920 --> 46:58.280]  uh,
[46:58.280 --> 46:58.600]  no,
[46:58.600 --> 46:59.800]  the issues in your area,
[46:59.800 --> 47:01.400]  it's not that difficult.
[47:01.400 --> 47:04.800]  It doesn't take that much time and it's incredibly important folks get out and
[47:04.800 --> 47:05.640]  do it.
[47:05.760 --> 47:06.840]  Mike always knows what's up.
[47:06.880 --> 47:08.120]  He's always got the right thing to say.
[47:08.160 --> 47:10.240]  If you're listening and you're in the industry,
[47:10.600 --> 47:13.360]  you should think about some sort of a show up with your,
[47:13.360 --> 47:14.400]  I voted sticker,
[47:14.400 --> 47:15.240]  get a dadadadada.
[47:15.680 --> 47:18.160]  You hear that?
[47:18.160 --> 47:18.880]  Think about it.
[47:18.920 --> 47:19.320]  Awesome.
[47:19.320 --> 47:20.480]  Promotion owners,
[47:20.520 --> 47:21.560]  store managers,
[47:21.760 --> 47:22.560]  people that voted,
[47:22.560 --> 47:22.960]  get a,
[47:22.960 --> 47:25.200]  a something like a percentage off today,
[47:25.200 --> 47:25.960]  a free pre-roll.
[47:25.960 --> 47:26.840]  If you spend something,
[47:27.280 --> 47:28.100]  I don't know.
[47:28.160 --> 47:28.600]  Go vote,
[47:28.600 --> 47:29.040]  go to the,
[47:29.040 --> 47:31.080]  go to the dispensary and celebrate your freedoms.
[47:31.280 --> 47:31.600]  All right,
[47:31.600 --> 47:32.000]  you guys.
[47:32.000 --> 47:32.320]  Hey Mike,
[47:32.320 --> 47:33.200]  thanks for coming and hanging out.
[47:33.200 --> 47:34.280]  I know you got that little guy at home.
[47:34.280 --> 47:35.440]  I know you want to go hang out with him.
[47:35.600 --> 47:35.840]  Yeah,
[47:35.840 --> 47:36.160]  man.
[47:36.160 --> 47:36.480]  It,
[47:36.480 --> 47:37.280]  uh,
[47:37.280 --> 47:38.360]  it'll be good to get home,
[47:38.360 --> 47:38.640]  but,
[47:38.640 --> 47:39.000]  uh,
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.200]  I love the podcast.
[47:40.200 --> 47:40.400]  I,
[47:40.400 --> 47:40.560]  uh,
[47:40.560 --> 47:42.520]  I'm happy to get over here and I love doing it.
[47:42.680 --> 47:43.360]  Thanks for coming on,
[47:43.360 --> 47:43.480]  bro.
[47:43.480 --> 47:44.320]  I love having you on the show.
[47:44.320 --> 47:45.440]  You're always a good material.
[47:45.440 --> 47:46.640]  The people love it when you ramble.
[47:47.000 --> 47:47.240]  Yeah.
[47:47.240 --> 47:48.840]  That you always bring good content.
[47:48.840 --> 47:49.160]  You guys,
[47:49.160 --> 47:50.520]  the next episode I have planned.
[47:50.920 --> 47:51.760]  Um,
[47:52.000 --> 47:52.360]  well,
[47:52.360 --> 47:53.880]  I don't even know if I should talk about Jesse coming.
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.520]  Jesse says he's going to come over tomorrow.
[47:55.560 --> 47:57.560]  Mike might go pick him up and make sure he shows up.
[47:57.600 --> 47:58.920]  We want to make sure that happens.
[47:58.920 --> 48:03.960]  So the next podcast will either be myself and Mike or Jesse and myself or myself,
[48:03.960 --> 48:04.760]  Mike and Jesse.
[48:04.760 --> 48:06.280]  You never know how it's going to go in these parts.
[48:07.600 --> 48:09.720]  There may or may not be a podcast recorded tomorrow.
[48:09.720 --> 48:10.960]  It may or may not be epic.
[48:11.040 --> 48:11.920]  It's outdoor season.
[48:11.920 --> 48:13.480]  So you never know what could go on right now,
[48:13.480 --> 48:14.720]  but I hope to have Jesse on tomorrow.
[48:14.720 --> 48:14.960]  Mike,
[48:14.960 --> 48:15.160]  you know,
[48:15.160 --> 48:16.000]  you're invited back.
[48:16.480 --> 48:17.080]  Then after that,
[48:17.080 --> 48:17.560]  you guys,
[48:17.560 --> 48:19.920]  I will be recording once again with the dabbing granny.
[48:19.920 --> 48:21.520]  I can't wait to have her back on the show.
[48:21.680 --> 48:23.040]  It's tentatively scheduled.
[48:23.040 --> 48:23.800]  That's a,
[48:23.840 --> 48:25.320]  the intro about the gear.
[48:25.320 --> 48:28.440]  We're test running everything to make sure that this goes smooth this time.
[48:28.440 --> 48:32.520]  Folks 48 minutes in of this part of the recording and everything's looking like it works.
[48:32.920 --> 48:33.840]  Things look good.
[48:33.880 --> 48:34.200]  Yes.
[48:34.200 --> 48:35.280]  It looks good so far.
[48:35.280 --> 48:35.760]  So far.
[48:35.760 --> 48:36.280]  So good.
[48:36.480 --> 48:36.720]  All right,
[48:36.720 --> 48:37.720]  let's quit while we're ahead.
[48:37.720 --> 48:37.920]  Mike,
[48:37.920 --> 48:38.560]  thanks for coming.
[48:38.680 --> 48:38.880]  Yeah,
[48:38.880 --> 48:39.320]  guys,
[48:39.360 --> 48:41.840]  I'm going to wrap up this part of the show and I'll be back in just a,
[48:41.840 --> 48:44.920]  a jingle and I will put a bow on this bitch.
[48:46.160 --> 48:46.400]  All right,

[51:00.640 --> 51:01.840]  down to sleep.

[51:40.400 --> 51:43.880]  It's destruction for the children.
[51:44.160 --> 51:47.200]  Love is all we need for the children.
