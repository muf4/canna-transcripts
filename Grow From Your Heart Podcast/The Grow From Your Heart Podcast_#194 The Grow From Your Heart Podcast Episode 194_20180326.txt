[00:17.150 --> 00:21.790]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 194 of the
[00:21.790 --> 00:25.470]  Grow From Your Heart podcast. You're a source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:25.470 --> 00:28.910]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:28.910 --> 00:32.230]  grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:32.230 --> 00:34.950]  activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of
[00:34.950 --> 00:40.590]  cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends call
[00:40.590 --> 00:43.950]  me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I need to
[00:43.950 --> 00:46.750]  send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for
[00:46.750 --> 00:50.790]  letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the
[00:50.790 --> 00:55.270]  entire Mystic Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a super special
[00:55.270 --> 00:58.750]  announcement to make. Our friends in the Mystic Roots band, Kat and Coot, had a
[00:58.750 --> 01:03.390]  beautiful baby. Congratulations, you guys. That baby is gorgeous. That is a future
[01:03.390 --> 01:07.070]  rock star. I cannot wait to see the style that kid has because those are some cool
[01:07.070 --> 01:10.790]  ass parents. Ganja star. Ganja star. Ladies and gentlemen, across the table
[01:10.790 --> 01:13.670]  from me on the microphone is our friend Jesse. Welcome back to the show, bro. Hey,
[01:13.870 --> 01:19.510]  thank you. What's up, everyone? Are you still doing your podcast? Kind of. It's
[01:19.510 --> 01:22.830]  on hiatus. It's on hiatus. Ladies and gentlemen, go listen to old episodes of
[01:22.870 --> 01:27.710]  the Colorado podcast featuring our friend Jesse Grose and also 44 and
[01:27.710 --> 01:31.910]  Despicable D. I hear there's a dude named Fetus that joins you sometimes. He was on
[01:31.910 --> 01:36.110]  one or two shows. Yeah. All right. We had a cousin Tater over there. Cousin Tater
[01:36.110 --> 01:38.910]  was around. I didn't see Tater. I wish I would have seen him. What up, cousin
[01:38.910 --> 01:41.830]  Tater? Shout out. I don't know if you listen to the show. He's still in town.
[01:41.910 --> 01:46.430]  I thought I heard he left. No, but oh, shit. He's back. He's a traveling salesman.
[01:46.430 --> 01:50.230]  My cousin Tater. I made you a promise and I will still honor that promise. We
[01:50.230 --> 01:52.510]  talked about something. I told you I would do something and I promised you
[01:52.510 --> 01:56.350]  something. I didn't forget, bro. I still owe you that. Let's get together. I'll
[01:56.350 --> 02:00.110]  make sure. Right. I found it. You found it. You found the article you're looking
[02:00.110 --> 02:05.070]  for. The attachment I've been looking for. Oh, that's been a while. While you
[02:05.070 --> 02:08.670]  were doing the whole opening thing. Yeah. Yes, I was searching for it through
[02:08.670 --> 02:12.590]  emails. Using your time wisely. I appreciate that. Big shout out to Kat
[02:12.590 --> 02:15.750]  and Coot and their new one. I do not know what they named the child. We don't
[02:15.750 --> 02:17.710]  need to talk about the child too much on there. We'll give the kids some
[02:17.710 --> 02:21.070]  privacy. A big shout out to my friends. I'm super proud of you guys. I'm excited
[02:21.070 --> 02:24.390]  for you. Jesse's back. Also, one more announcement before we get into the
[02:24.390 --> 02:27.430]  email that Jesse just dug up. Ladies and gentlemen, Mike was talking about
[02:27.430 --> 02:31.270]  going to Mexico on the last podcast. He made it. They're in Mexico. They're
[02:31.270 --> 02:34.590]  safe. They got there. They're all in one piece. The jacket, the shoes all
[02:34.590 --> 02:38.910]  made it. Everyone's happy. Baby's cool. They did it. I've spent a good amount of
[02:38.910 --> 02:44.910]  time in a place in Mexico about 150 miles from where they're at. How was it?
[02:45.350 --> 02:49.350]  It was fucking awesome. Fucking awesome. It was one of the best nine months of my
[02:49.350 --> 02:55.350]  life. Wow. Yeah. Well, it was two different sessions. Okay. It was some of
[02:55.350 --> 03:01.150]  the best times of my life. And it really, it was when I was in my very early 20s.
[03:01.390 --> 03:04.110]  So where you didn't give a shit that there were cartels down the street that
[03:04.110 --> 03:06.990]  may remove your head if you walked down the wrong street. I never even saw him.
[03:07.070 --> 03:13.710]  Nice. It doesn't exist, at least where I was at. And you know, this was fuck 16
[03:13.750 --> 03:17.110]  years. Oh, yeah, it was different. So it was different. Well, everybody says that
[03:17.110 --> 03:21.190]  this town is shitty, but I don't see it because I don't go to where that shit is.
[03:21.190 --> 03:26.470]  I'm not involved in that. So I don't see that. It's got its spots. I mean, I was
[03:27.430 --> 03:31.590]  getting coffee at the 711 on East fourth street the other day and saw a dude
[03:31.590 --> 03:37.230]  shooting up like right on the corner. Didn't give a fuck. Like, that's
[03:37.270 --> 03:40.670]  unfortunately, that was actually the first time in my life I've ever seen that.
[03:41.390 --> 03:45.230]  He could have been taking care of his diabetes, bro. Yeah, I don't. There were
[03:45.230 --> 03:49.750]  three other guys standing around him. Yeah, they all use the same needle. Come
[03:49.750 --> 03:54.030]  on, Pueblo get it together. Diabetics. If you guys are on drugs, if you're using
[03:54.030 --> 03:57.710]  drugs, and you need some help, just hit one of us up because we want to have you
[03:57.710 --> 04:02.270]  not do drugs. Heroin's bad. Okay, crack is whack. Get your shit together. Wow.
[04:02.430 --> 04:05.710]  Kill your local heroin dealer. That's right. Don't do stupid drugs. You guys.
[04:06.110 --> 04:09.790]  Meth is meth is dumb. Heroin. Stupid. Crack is whack. Smoke some weed.
[04:10.710 --> 04:13.790]  Mushrooms are all right. I'm not your parents. But I think mushrooms are cool.
[04:13.790 --> 04:17.230]  And I feel like a blast of DMT every once in a while is all right. Never tried
[04:17.230 --> 04:20.350]  it. But acids. Awesome. Your acid acid is good for your brain. I was telling
[04:20.350 --> 04:23.430]  somebody today that I feel like acid is therapeutic and it's good for you. And I
[04:23.430 --> 04:27.670]  love some shrooms. Yes, we let's get back on cannabis so that we don't sway
[04:27.670 --> 04:32.590]  too far from our stuff. I've covered all of the main notes. We're going to do sort
[04:32.590 --> 04:36.430]  of an outdoor episode. This is gonna be part two of the outdoor season. Part 1.5
[04:36.470 --> 04:41.190]  Yes, because we're going to focus mostly on amending native soils. Jesse seemed
[04:41.190 --> 04:44.070]  very excited to talk about it is near and dear to his heart and fresh in his
[04:44.070 --> 04:49.390]  mind. So where do you want to get started in talking about amending native soils
[04:49.390 --> 04:52.190]  before we get there? Let's tell people how they can stalk you on social media
[04:52.190 --> 04:57.510]  first. Jesse grows on Instagram. stalk him. Yeah, that's pretty much it. All
[04:57.510 --> 05:00.150]  right. Look for him on Jesse grows on Instagram. That way you can put a face to
[05:00.150 --> 05:05.150]  this sexy voice. You can figure out who I am on Facebook. Like I might say
[05:05.150 --> 05:11.070]  what's up, but we'll see. We'll keep that vague. So I don't think it's very
[05:11.070 --> 05:22.070]  hard. Damn, the music quit. Song ended. Sorry. Alright, so native soils back in
[05:22.070 --> 05:27.190]  the last episode, we were talking about different if you should grow in a pot,
[05:27.270 --> 05:31.430]  or if you know a big smart pot, you know, whatever works best for your
[05:31.430 --> 05:37.070]  location. So if you're one of the people that falls into the let's go ahead and
[05:37.070 --> 05:41.790]  amend my local soil this episode, it's going to be very interesting. All right.
[05:42.790 --> 05:43.630]  So
[05:45.990 --> 05:52.630]  soil in America soil on earth is either sandy or clay or loamy.
[05:54.390 --> 05:58.030]  Now I understand Sandy, that's obvious clay. That's like when it's muddy and
[05:58.030 --> 06:05.070]  clay and moisture in southern Colorado. Well, say it varies where you're at. You
[06:05.070 --> 06:09.230]  know, if you're close to a river, okay, if you're up on a plateau, if you're on
[06:09.230 --> 06:14.070]  the side of a mountain, you can also have what is called shallow soil and
[06:14.070 --> 06:18.910]  that really sucks. And that means that you live on bedrock basically, which is
[06:18.910 --> 06:22.990]  great for building a house but shitty for growing plants. All right. So tell me
[06:22.990 --> 06:25.990]  about the loamy texture. I'm not familiar with that too much. loamy is
[06:25.990 --> 06:31.550]  going to be really similar to what bagged organic soil looks like. Okay, so
[06:31.550 --> 06:32.150]  um,
[06:33.390 --> 06:39.670]  think of like fertilum. Okay, remember that? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Imagine mixing that
[06:39.670 --> 06:44.630]  like half and half with some sand, and then half and half with some root 707.
[06:44.710 --> 06:47.990]  Okay, I can feel that texture in my hand. It stays cold for some reason.
[06:48.030 --> 06:52.510]  That's some real fluffy, you know, all right, earthy soil. And that's good
[06:52.510 --> 06:55.630]  because you'll get a lot of aeration and you won't get it won't squish the roots
[06:55.630 --> 06:59.190]  and the airs can get oxygen in there. Yeah, or co2 I guess it'll happen in the
[06:59.190 --> 07:04.990]  earth. decomposition from below. Yeah, yeah, that most definitely will happen.
[07:05.350 --> 07:13.030]  Water in the earth water carries oxygen, oxygen down. So okay. Yeah. So either
[07:13.030 --> 07:20.830]  sandy or loamy, or I mean, clay, sandy or clay soil. But the most people aren't
[07:20.830 --> 07:26.750]  going to have a loamy soil. It's either going to be sandy or clay. But the easy
[07:26.750 --> 07:32.990]  way to fix that is you add compost, and you either add sand or clay depending on
[07:32.990 --> 07:38.270]  what it is compost form castings, and peat moss, and you can come up with this
[07:38.270 --> 07:39.030]  loamy soil.
[07:41.510 --> 07:45.430]  And that is what you want to shoot for when you're growing pot
[07:46.790 --> 07:47.550]  in the ground.
[07:48.750 --> 07:53.270]  Give a nice, nice aeration. Nice. Not enough for the roots to grab onto so it's
[07:53.270 --> 07:56.150]  not going to be too fluffy, and a dark black soil.
[07:57.510 --> 07:59.990]  You're going to want to check the pH on it.
[08:01.110 --> 08:04.230]  What's the proper way to check the pH once that soils mixed just with one of
[08:04.230 --> 08:07.950]  those soil test kits? Like, yeah, yeah, just like one of the ones where you
[08:08.030 --> 08:12.830]  dissolve a little soil into it with some water. And then you like open up a
[08:12.830 --> 08:18.070]  capsule and drop the the powder that's inside the capsule. And it'll change the
[08:18.070 --> 08:22.030]  color and show you which side you're on. Yeah. How do you adjust soil pH if you
[08:22.030 --> 08:26.430]  find that it's too high or too low? I've never had that. Okay.
[08:27.190 --> 08:32.910]  I know potash will take the soil pH up if it's too acidic. Okay, that's probably
[08:32.910 --> 08:36.470]  not going to be a problem though. Most people are going to want to bring the
[08:36.510 --> 08:41.790]  soil pH down. So you're gonna want to use something that is acidic.
[08:44.030 --> 08:48.470]  Where I'm working at, we've been using Bokashi tea. Oh, okay. Bokashi
[08:48.470 --> 08:55.110]  tea. We've been doing a process where we add apple cider vinegar at the initial
[08:55.110 --> 09:01.870]  stage of the fermentation. And it creates a product that is pretty fucking
[09:01.870 --> 09:02.510]  corrosive.
[09:03.670 --> 09:08.950]  But I bet it smells amazing. Oh, it's we we got smells hashtag we got smells.
[09:13.190 --> 09:14.630]  I'm gonna steal that. Yeah.
[09:14.630 --> 09:21.870]  Yeah. So that's what we've been using primarily at my work. That's what I have
[09:21.870 --> 09:26.150]  experience with right now to bring the pH of the soil down. Other things that
[09:26.150 --> 09:28.870]  can bring soil pH down is
[09:30.510 --> 09:38.310]  Neem Neem Mill, I believe brings it down. A big easy thing that's readily
[09:38.310 --> 09:43.270]  accessible that can bring the soil pH down those compost. Any good thermal
[09:43.270 --> 09:47.310]  compost is going to have an acidic base. Okay, so just throw your compost in
[09:47.310 --> 09:50.430]  there. Just add more because you should be putting some in there anyway. Yeah,
[09:50.430 --> 09:55.150]  yeah. All right. Neem. As far as like dry amendments, so back on that part,
[09:55.590 --> 09:57.550]  Neem cake, I believe is acidic.
[09:59.030 --> 10:05.470]  Kelp mill will bring soil pH down. Oyster shell mill definitely brings pH
[10:05.470 --> 10:10.030]  soil down. But that's only after it's broken down. So well, some dolomite lime
[10:10.070 --> 10:13.990]  help me balance out my pH. I believe that's the go to. That's the one I was
[10:13.990 --> 10:17.310]  skipping all around. All right. I didn't want to be too obvious. I thought you
[10:17.310 --> 10:22.790]  were, you know, I was trying to be creative. Dolomite lime is that I avoid
[10:22.790 --> 10:28.990]  using it personally. So is there a reason? It's not completely natural. Okay.
[10:30.230 --> 10:32.990]  Speaking of natural, can we talk about the natural product that you showed up
[10:32.990 --> 10:37.030]  with? Yeah, for sure. That is also a product that will bring soil pH. This
[10:37.030 --> 10:40.350]  sandwich baggie. This is a normal size sandwich baggie that you'd probably put
[10:40.350 --> 10:44.430]  an ounce of weed in. Yeah, it's an ounce of weed baggie. This bag weighs, I'm
[10:44.430 --> 10:48.150]  going to drop it on the table. Yeah, you guys, you heard that through the mics.
[10:48.150 --> 10:52.790]  That's a bag of it looks like really fine sand, but it is so heavy. This has
[10:52.790 --> 10:53.750]  got to be six pounds.
[10:55.270 --> 10:57.830]  Let's see. Oh, Jesse's gonna weigh it with his hand.
[10:59.670 --> 11:04.070]  I'd say three, four pounds. Okay. Yeah. All right. I don't know. Maybe, maybe
[11:04.670 --> 11:07.710]  yeah, it's amazing how dense that is in that package.
[11:09.990 --> 11:15.710]  I'm now comparing it to a loaf of bread. Because that weighs a pound. Oh, I never
[11:15.710 --> 11:19.390]  knew that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What? So how many loads?
[11:21.750 --> 11:25.270]  sack full of fuck. Are we doing Ezekiel bread? Are we doing that shitty wonder
[11:25.270 --> 11:29.310]  bread? Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's that's what you know, regular sandwich. All right.
[11:29.790 --> 11:33.550]  All right. That's like, that's a jug of milk. That's a couple jug. That's two
[11:33.830 --> 11:38.070]  milk. He's like 3.75 pounds. Yeah, it's a jug of milk. All right. So what what is
[11:38.070 --> 11:41.470]  in this magical dust that you have gifted us? Okay, so
[11:42.470 --> 11:43.870]  I know you can't say too much. I'm not gonna
[11:43.870 --> 11:47.590]  can't say too much because it's still in product development we're doing but but
[11:47.670 --> 11:54.870]  it is accessible to the public and we'll I'll give you links to get the guy that
[11:54.870 --> 11:58.110]  can you can buy it from here in Colorado.
[11:58.230 --> 11:59.070]  Um,
[12:01.870 --> 12:03.070]  can we say where it came from?
[12:04.670 --> 12:09.790]  It comes from the Four Corners region of America. Okay. Oh, fuck. It's the wrong
[12:09.790 --> 12:12.790]  email. So I'm not trying to ask too many questions. But I'm trying to keep you
[12:12.790 --> 12:14.750]  moving while you're searching. But I don't want to get you in any trouble.
[12:14.750 --> 12:17.910]  Because I know that you have agreed to not talk too much about it. I signed and
[12:17.950 --> 12:23.790]  signed an NDA. Okay, so volcanic rock dust. It comes from a volcano somewhere
[12:23.790 --> 12:32.430]  here in the southwest United States. It can replace your oyster shell, it can
[12:32.430 --> 12:38.350]  replace your bus. Let's say you got a you're running no till. So you're using
[12:38.350 --> 12:42.710]  like the standard kutz mix. It replaces all of those minerals in there. It also
[12:42.710 --> 12:48.590]  replaces any need for agasil or for add any kind of silica. Okay, well, it's got
[12:48.590 --> 12:53.350]  my silicates in there. Okay. You said as a mite also? Yeah, as a moisture shell,
[12:53.470 --> 12:57.110]  it can replace the dolomite lime if I'm using that. What else can it replace for
[12:57.110 --> 13:02.590]  us? It in certain ways, it can replace crustacean meal, it doesn't have the
[13:02.630 --> 13:08.910]  cationic stage that crustacean meal has, obviously. And then crustacean meal also
[13:09.430 --> 13:16.910]  really helps add in soil breakdown in its own special way. And why this product
[13:16.910 --> 13:22.550]  does that to, you know, it can reduce the amount of crustacean meal you have to
[13:22.550 --> 13:25.910]  use. So let's put it that way. Does this have a product name yet? Or is this just
[13:25.910 --> 13:32.910]  highly nutritious, minimal volcano dust? We're calling it volcanic rock ash at the
[13:32.910 --> 13:35.470]  moment. Okay, that's what it looks like now that you say that.
[13:37.190 --> 13:41.670]  It's been screened. It's also water soluble. You can dump that in a bucket of
[13:41.670 --> 13:46.310]  water and use it to fully feed your plants. Wow. Yeah, I bet they're gonna go
[13:46.310 --> 13:50.390]  crazy. Yeah, I wouldn't use it in hydroponics because it will settle. It'll
[13:50.390 --> 13:54.910]  clog up the system. Yeah, a little bit. And there are some heavier aspects of it
[13:54.910 --> 14:01.630]  that will drop out. Only parts of it are water soluble. Okay. I should put it that
[14:01.630 --> 14:04.990]  way. But it's a foliar. That's gonna be awesome. I've been using it for a month
[14:04.990 --> 14:11.070]  at my work. That means we've been using it in four cycles. So I've got plants
[14:11.070 --> 14:17.310]  that are five weeks in at the moment. And then we've been using it as foliar
[14:17.310 --> 14:22.390]  spraying the badge and everything. And it's pretty fucking amazing. Nice. Yeah,
[14:22.430 --> 14:25.030]  nice. I'm excited to use it. Thank you. I'll let everybody on the show know how
[14:25.030 --> 14:26.150]  it goes. And then
[14:26.990 --> 14:33.510]  it's other places that have used it have reported to like 10 15% more yield. And
[14:33.510 --> 14:38.470]  I'm easily looking at the stage of development I can see now I see more
[14:38.470 --> 14:41.950]  yield. Nice. That's always helpful. More yield is always better. It's also
[14:41.950 --> 14:45.430]  cheaper. You're putting this powder in there all that that way that way to this
[14:45.430 --> 14:49.030]  bag is going to translate to the weight in your buds. It's kind of how I feel
[14:49.030 --> 14:54.350]  about that much every heavy metal mineral you need. That's awesome. All
[14:54.350 --> 14:57.150]  right, let's get back on track. We're talking about I distracted us. I'm high.
[14:57.150 --> 15:00.830]  I took a couple dabs of cactus cooler. kind of made my head spin. I needed that.
[15:01.190 --> 15:04.750]  We were talking about amending native soils. We were talking about how to
[15:04.750 --> 15:07.790]  adjust the pH you taught me a whole bunch of stuff that I never knew about
[15:07.790 --> 15:13.430]  that. So we've got sandy or clay soil. We've added p and compost on we've
[15:13.430 --> 15:17.070]  talked about adjusting the pH. Now what's the next step? Let me go back to
[15:17.070 --> 15:25.430]  pH. Okay. Okay. I've never worried about pH in my life. Just of the soil, right?
[15:25.430 --> 15:30.030]  You pH pH of the soil. Well, since I've gotten no till I don't worry about.
[15:30.070 --> 15:34.950]  Yeah, that's rad. And I still pretty much don't I just make sure it's acidic.
[15:34.970 --> 15:41.110]  So you do want to avoid feeding anything into your soil. I've learned this
[15:41.110 --> 15:48.230]  through. I mean, I've grown like 15,000 plants in the last six months. So I've
[15:48.230 --> 15:54.150]  learned a thing or two. Never feed your plants anything that is basic. Always
[15:54.270 --> 16:02.990]  figure out. There's always some organic way or conventional way to make your
[16:02.990 --> 16:07.670]  solution acidic. So there's always make sure it's okay. That's good. Good
[16:07.790 --> 16:11.630]  recommendation. And same with your soil. And most of the time when you're buying a
[16:11.630 --> 16:16.230]  pre bag soil from a store and you're only using it once or twice, you don't
[16:16.270 --> 16:20.310]  have to worry about it. There's no need to test it. Don't freak out. It's acidic.
[16:20.350 --> 16:25.630]  So it's that's one of the reasons it works. And that's why that company is
[16:25.630 --> 16:31.190]  able to have repeat customers. It's when you start using soil over and over and
[16:31.190 --> 16:39.070]  over again, is that the the acidity starts to disappear and it gets more basic
[16:39.070 --> 16:43.510]  and the pH rises and you start to run into all kinds of fucked up problems.
[16:44.390 --> 16:48.950]  Diminished yields, slow growth, macro deficiencies really easily.
[16:49.670 --> 16:54.950]  Pest. Less resistance to pests.
[16:54.950 --> 16:57.910]  Okay, less resistance to everything. Yeah, yeah. So okay.
[16:58.310 --> 17:04.750]  So when you're in, this is important if you're setting up a native soil because
[17:05.350 --> 17:09.390]  say you're here in Colorado, all of our soil here on the ground is really fucking
[17:09.390 --> 17:15.470]  out alkaline, especially like the San Luis Valley, anywhere in the front range.
[17:15.470 --> 17:20.270]  When you get up into the mountains, you may find like forest humus based soils
[17:20.270 --> 17:25.270]  where it's going to naturally be more acidic. But in the front range area, it's
[17:25.310 --> 17:27.630]  going to be alkaline as fuck.
[17:28.750 --> 17:32.990]  So when you're setting up a long term soil, you need to check it every year and
[17:32.990 --> 17:36.710]  make sure you're staying, you know, at least below.
[17:37.910 --> 17:44.030]  Six point two, you know, six point two, six point five is kind of that's what we've
[17:44.030 --> 17:48.070]  been shooting for at work. That's that's what they say to go for for tomatoes.
[17:48.190 --> 17:51.870]  Okay. And what works for tomatoes and hops really works for cannabis for the most
[17:51.910 --> 17:52.410]  part.
[17:52.590 --> 17:57.430]  Oh, fucking hops actually kind of like alkaline soil. Oh, okay. Doing some
[17:57.430 --> 18:01.870]  schooling me into, uh, growing some other cash crops. All right. You're going to
[18:01.870 --> 18:06.070]  grow some hops for a course. I heard an acre of hops growing the right way is
[18:06.070 --> 18:12.110]  worth like $40,000. Wow. And there's no licensing, no regulations, legal money.
[18:12.270 --> 18:17.990]  Yeah. Legal money is good. You're a farm boy. Get it going. We'll see. Research,
[18:17.990 --> 18:21.310]  research, research. So in like 10 years, is there going to be the, uh,
[18:22.030 --> 18:28.510]  the Jesse beer company? No, no, no. Yeah. Too much licensing. True. Yeah.
[18:28.710 --> 18:31.590]  And there's so many beer companies. I'll grow the shit for him though. All right.
[18:31.990 --> 18:36.550]  And then just get some kickbacks. Pay me in beer. No, pay me in cash. Yes.
[18:37.510 --> 18:40.830]  Pay me in cash. I will buy all the other things I need with it. Right. Yeah.
[18:41.630 --> 18:48.070]  Um, yeah. So make sure your soil is, you know, down in the acidity range. Um,
[18:48.150 --> 18:53.190]  I'm really excited because I've been grown in, in ground in the same six holes
[18:53.190 --> 18:57.630]  for a long fucking time and I've never checked the soil pH.
[18:58.230 --> 18:59.990]  So shit might get retarded.
[19:01.750 --> 19:05.190]  You might want to go check it, bro. It's a, it's, it's early still.
[19:05.190 --> 19:08.190]  You got plenty of time. I was going to say it's March, but it's about to be April.
[19:08.910 --> 19:13.030]  Changing your acidity and your natural soil does not happen overnight.
[19:13.430 --> 19:15.470]  And Jeff just brought up a very good point.
[19:15.470 --> 19:20.470]  You need to be checking the shit right now. Um, you know, that this,
[19:20.910 --> 19:25.910]  this is the time to do it because the things you use to bring down the soil pH
[19:27.270 --> 19:32.270]  are, they have to, you know, dissolve and break down to actually affect their
[19:33.510 --> 19:35.870]  change. So they have to get in there and work and mesh.
[19:36.030 --> 19:39.470]  They have to become bioavailable. Yeah. And, and don't be alarmed when you,
[19:39.710 --> 19:42.710]  you know, after you do a bunch of stuff, um,
[19:42.710 --> 19:46.310]  and then you recheck your soil pH, you know, give it some time. Don't,
[19:46.350 --> 19:50.910]  don't be alarmed if you check it and nothing's changed it or if it's only went
[19:50.950 --> 19:54.070]  out a little bit. Yeah. It's gotta work. It's gotta, it's gotta cook.
[19:54.190 --> 19:57.350]  That's the big secret on growing with the native soils. Um,
[19:57.550 --> 20:01.950]  the other Bokashi pulp is another great way to bring down soil pH. Okay.
[20:01.990 --> 20:04.910]  So that stink juice that comes out of the Bokashi bucket. No, no.
[20:05.630 --> 20:09.310]  The stuff that, Oh, the pulp. Yeah. The pulp part. Okay. Yeah. All right.
[20:09.470 --> 20:14.470]  And it breaks down and if it's wet enough and you're treating it right,
[20:14.990 --> 20:18.670]  it'll break down in just a couple of weeks and turn into black compost.
[20:18.710 --> 20:22.310]  I haven't emptied that Bokashi bucket completely in a year.
[20:23.270 --> 20:26.590]  So whatever is at the very bottom has been in there for a year and it never
[20:26.590 --> 20:29.110]  fills up and eats itself so much.
[20:29.230 --> 20:34.230]  I did that once for a while. And uh, when I finally did open it,
[20:34.550 --> 20:38.070]  it was already black compost at the bottom. Right. Yeah. It's fucking,
[20:38.110 --> 20:41.310]  and it just keeps eating. When I put more scraps in there, it never gets full.
[20:41.310 --> 20:44.670]  Like that black compost can eat, it'll eat a whole banana in three days.
[20:44.750 --> 20:48.150]  Like it'll destroy that banana. You'll never see it. Yeah. Yeah.
[20:48.150 --> 20:52.390]  And the juice that comes out smells like the bar trash can that somebody threw up
[20:52.390 --> 20:56.470]  in and buried and dug up and ate and re-vomited. Oh, it stinks so bad.
[20:57.110 --> 21:00.510]  They love it. You can, when I use that in the mix, they stand straight up.
[21:01.030 --> 21:05.910]  I had always like fed it to my plants, like one mil per gallon.
[21:05.950 --> 21:10.870]  You know, that was like a heavy dose. They could totally take, I mean,
[21:11.030 --> 21:14.710]  I wouldn't do it repeatedly, but they can take up to like an ounce per gallon.
[21:15.150 --> 21:17.430]  They can take a lot of it. It's all organic, you know, and it's,
[21:17.790 --> 21:20.910]  don't fully or spray it more than five mils per gallon though.
[21:21.030 --> 21:24.070]  Yeah. I wouldn't, I don't think I would fully or spray it myself.
[21:24.110 --> 21:27.990]  There are a couple of things that I would be afraid of in my situation,
[21:28.070 --> 21:31.190]  which is, you know, primarily greenhouse. Yeah. Um,
[21:31.710 --> 21:35.270]  super high ventilation. Right. Uh, they, they love it.
[21:35.310 --> 21:38.030]  So you know what I'm thinking about too? The same problem that indoors,
[21:38.030 --> 21:40.070]  that may not be good, but in a greenhouse environment,
[21:40.070 --> 21:41.670]  go for it because you're going to have enough airflow,
[21:41.670 --> 21:43.670]  enough nature to make things all right. Indoors,
[21:43.670 --> 21:47.270]  you may cause yourself some problems for sure. Uh, that, that's an amazing bucket.
[21:47.470 --> 21:49.470]  Bokashi has never paid me, uh,
[21:49.510 --> 21:53.310]  but Bokashi and the stuff that goes in the Bokashi bucket and that process,
[21:53.310 --> 21:54.830]  that is an amazing process.
[21:54.950 --> 21:59.950]  So here's a way you can make it at home without having to pay 35 bucks for the
[22:00.270 --> 22:02.870]  bucket. You get two five gallon buckets.
[22:03.310 --> 22:08.310]  You drill a whole bunch of holes in one of them and you go to Lowe's and get
[22:10.030 --> 22:13.710]  just a, I can't remember what it's called.
[22:13.710 --> 22:17.910]  It costs like three and a half bucks and it looks pretty much just like the
[22:17.910 --> 22:20.670]  little spigot, the little spigot. Yeah. Yeah. So you,
[22:20.870 --> 22:24.430]  and you don't even actually have to put the spigot on there, but this is,
[22:24.430 --> 22:28.390]  if you want to collect the, the, the juice, the chelate, um,
[22:28.430 --> 22:31.110]  you put that in the bucket that you don't drill the holes in.
[22:31.270 --> 22:34.790]  So you got one bucket with the little spout on it and then you have another
[22:34.790 --> 22:37.710]  bucket with holes in it and you put the whole bucket into the bucket with the
[22:37.710 --> 22:40.430]  spout and put your shit in there and cover it.
[22:40.630 --> 22:45.630]  And then you get you an airtight like paint lid that you can also get at Lowe's.
[22:45.910 --> 22:49.470]  Yep. Boom. Bokashi bucket for like 15 bucks. Yeah.
[22:49.470 --> 22:52.270]  Those buckets are like $4 a piece and that spouts three and a half to take you
[22:52.270 --> 22:55.510]  a few minutes to make it seal it real well because if that stuff leaks out,
[22:55.510 --> 22:58.070]  Oh my God, it's the worst smelling stuff ever. Yeah.
[22:58.070 --> 23:01.510]  You'll want to like run some, you know, like some silicone. Yeah.
[23:01.550 --> 23:04.310]  Cause there'll never be any reason to take them apart. Right.
[23:04.390 --> 23:06.390]  Once it's together, it's good. Yeah. Or some,
[23:06.430 --> 23:09.350]  at least some duct tape or some shit like that. Um,
[23:09.430 --> 23:11.590]  and then there's also making,
[23:11.990 --> 23:16.110]  if you're in a part of the world where you can't get, um,
[23:16.670 --> 23:21.190]  Bokashi grain, it is also super easy to make. Look it up on YouTube.
[23:21.470 --> 23:22.870]  Do you, could you teach us how to do that?
[23:22.870 --> 23:25.950]  Or is that something we got to YouTube? Cause we, we would have to plan it.
[23:25.990 --> 23:28.950]  Okay. I can totally. Yeah. On one of the next episodes, let's do that.
[23:29.030 --> 23:32.630]  What I've only done like half the steps.
[23:32.790 --> 23:35.270]  I've never completely taken it to the grain.
[23:35.390 --> 23:39.910]  I haven't added any Bokashi to that bucket in nine months,
[23:39.910 --> 23:42.430]  honestly. And it's still just doing its thing. Um,
[23:43.310 --> 23:46.990]  you can actually use the serum that comes out. Let's call it that. Okay.
[23:47.270 --> 23:50.710]  Too late. I think it's leachate is what Sean was calling it. I think. Yeah.
[23:50.710 --> 23:53.750]  You were, we were both close. Yeah. That's serum. Yeah. Serum.
[23:53.750 --> 23:56.150]  The serum that comes out, um,
[23:56.190 --> 23:58.990]  you can actually use that as a mother culture to keep it all going.
[23:58.990 --> 24:01.430]  Just like a sourdough bread. That's awesome. Yeah.
[24:01.590 --> 24:04.870]  What if I poured it back in and like, okay. Yeah. Okay. So
[24:06.350 --> 24:09.830]  I haven't done this, but I'm like 90% sure it'll work.
[24:10.030 --> 24:11.510]  If you take that serum out,
[24:11.630 --> 24:16.510]  you dilute it one part to one part with molasses and then you soak,
[24:16.510 --> 24:18.030]  say like some wheat bran,
[24:18.630 --> 24:22.070]  some par cooked wheat bran and you let it,
[24:22.590 --> 24:27.230]  let it soak for like a week and then lay it out and let it air dry.
[24:27.430 --> 24:32.030]  I'm pretty fucking sure you got Bokashi grain at the end of that. I think so.
[24:32.230 --> 24:35.070]  Yeah. Yeah. This is fermented rice holes or fermented grains.
[24:35.190 --> 24:39.190]  You could use rice holes. Yeah. Any kind of par boiled you.
[24:39.870 --> 24:43.990]  I pretty sure you want to take the starch off, but don't quote me on that part,
[24:44.910 --> 24:49.150]  but par boiling it will, we'll take the starch off. Okay. Yeah.
[24:49.190 --> 24:52.630]  It'll take, it'll be on the top, right? Okay. Yeah. So nice.
[24:53.230 --> 24:55.310]  A lot of farm boy tricks coming into weed growing.
[24:55.590 --> 24:59.430]  I can't wait for it to go back to being a farm product. Like it's really,
[25:00.070 --> 25:02.230]  we're on the one, a weird realm right now.
[25:02.230 --> 25:05.110]  I went to a department of ag training and they're showing us all this greenhouse
[25:05.110 --> 25:07.870]  stuff. And I was like, Oh, we're so close to that. Like we'll get,
[25:07.870 --> 25:11.230]  I feel we'll go back to that. We're indoors right now and all that,
[25:11.230 --> 25:13.350]  but we're going to head, we're going to be out of the crop soon.
[25:13.910 --> 25:17.310]  As the demand is more States come online.
[25:18.030 --> 25:22.990]  Um, and the demand goes down, the price goes down.
[25:23.630 --> 25:26.150]  You're going to have to reduce the price of production.
[25:26.430 --> 25:30.790]  And that means growing it outdoors and in greenhouses. Sunshine. Yeah. Yeah.
[25:31.310 --> 25:34.430]  Every one of those Gavitas costs about a hundred dollars a day to run.
[25:34.470 --> 25:37.510]  If you're on a 12, 12 cycle, it's about a hundred dollars a day to run a Gavita.
[25:37.910 --> 25:41.390]  And most facilities have a minimum of a hundred lights in a flower room.
[25:41.670 --> 25:44.030]  Most in Colorado, you're looking at 400 lights.
[25:44.070 --> 25:47.950]  I've seriously seen $25,000 electric bills. Yeah. Oh yeah.
[25:47.950 --> 25:50.950]  That's not uncommon in the industry. Just one month. I pulled the, uh,
[25:50.990 --> 25:52.110]  the electric bill,
[25:52.110 --> 25:55.230]  the black Hills bill comes in the mailbox at the grow and I pull it out and it
[25:55.230 --> 25:58.310]  is thick. Like it's, it's like a notepad thick. You're like,
[25:58.310 --> 26:01.510]  how many folds do they fold on this thing? Yeah. Like how many trees?
[26:01.790 --> 26:05.310]  And that's just the electric bill. The water bill has got to be expensive. Um,
[26:05.350 --> 26:07.790]  think about this, you guys in a commercial grow, uh,
[26:07.790 --> 26:10.390]  if you're watering pots or if you're running hydro,
[26:10.390 --> 26:14.550]  all of that water that you use when it's done running through your pots or
[26:14.550 --> 26:15.510]  through your hydro system,
[26:15.510 --> 26:19.510]  it is now considered hazardous waste and it cannot go down your municipal water
[26:19.510 --> 26:22.750]  supply drains. It has to be handled for, yeah,
[26:22.750 --> 26:25.310]  it has to be accounted for and handled as hazardous waste.
[26:25.310 --> 26:26.750]  That water is now contaminated.
[26:27.030 --> 26:31.310]  You can either filter it yourself and try to reuse it or you have to deal with
[26:31.310 --> 26:34.190]  it properly in a legal way. Uh,
[26:34.230 --> 26:37.390]  that's approved by the department of agriculture, the department of health,
[26:37.430 --> 26:41.310]  the MED. Uh, yeah. Think about all those expenses.
[26:41.350 --> 26:45.990]  My buddy that owns a mechanic shop here in town that listens to the show every
[26:45.990 --> 26:48.030]  now and then is laughing his ass.
[26:48.070 --> 26:50.750]  Right. Cause he's had to get rid of oil and transmission fluid.
[26:50.790 --> 26:53.670]  He's like, ah, welcome to the real world fuckers. Yeah.
[26:53.870 --> 26:56.790]  So think about when you water a plant, all that water that runs out of the plant,
[26:56.790 --> 27:00.830]  the drain off every ounce of that has to be accounted for and has to go somewhere.
[27:00.830 --> 27:02.710]  You guys were not just throwing that down the drain.
[27:02.990 --> 27:05.150]  Cause that goes back into what Jesse and I drink.
[27:05.190 --> 27:07.870]  Yeah. It might work at waters that come pre filled.
[27:08.630 --> 27:10.630]  That's beautiful. See, yeah, but we're,
[27:10.630 --> 27:14.470]  I'm in an indoor building and it's a big square and it's, yeah, it's fun.
[27:14.710 --> 27:15.870]  All right. We got way off track.
[27:15.910 --> 27:20.150]  We're using the Bokashi juice to make our own Bokashi. We're using compost.
[27:21.150 --> 27:25.590]  There you go. Earthworms. Well, earthworms living or they're just the castings.
[27:26.550 --> 27:29.790]  Um, both red wigglers. Yeah. Yeah. I would actually,
[27:31.590 --> 27:33.990]  in most places, um,
[27:34.630 --> 27:39.510]  I would recommend worms are more important than castings are as long as you have
[27:39.510 --> 27:44.190]  a good compost. Okay. Now if you're in Colorado, California, Washington, Oregon,
[27:44.350 --> 27:47.910]  you know, one of those places get both.
[27:50.150 --> 27:54.310]  But yeah, worms are more important than anything else. All right. Um,
[27:54.350 --> 27:55.190]  after that,
[27:56.310 --> 28:00.830]  so once you have this loamy soil pH balanced,
[28:01.350 --> 28:06.350]  um, at this point, then you can add nutrients to it.
[28:06.470 --> 28:10.590]  Honestly, it's not even completely necessary. Um,
[28:10.710 --> 28:14.830]  but as far as nutrients, you know what I mean? Like alfalfa, kelp mill,
[28:16.190 --> 28:20.870]  um, comfrey, comfrey, um, man,
[28:21.230 --> 28:24.750]  crustacean mill, uh, this volcanic,
[28:24.750 --> 28:28.430]  uh, rock dust. Um,
[28:29.070 --> 28:31.310]  I mean, before I forget about that, yeah.
[28:31.310 --> 28:34.510]  Read that to us. Jesse's high. You guys, I got Jesse too high at the start of the
[28:34.510 --> 28:37.230]  show. So that's why I take a break and remember his notes.
[28:37.310 --> 28:39.150]  I had a couple of beers before I came here.
[28:39.270 --> 28:41.750]  I think the couple of beers made you more talkative and loosened you up.
[28:41.830 --> 28:42.670]  Oh, most definitely.
[28:42.670 --> 28:45.190]  It may have made you forget what the hell you were saying,
[28:45.230 --> 28:46.470]  but it did loosen you up a little.
[28:46.510 --> 28:48.430]  Yeah. Um, all right.
[28:48.430 --> 28:53.110]  So you want to call my buddy Victor at innovative organics.
[28:53.110 --> 28:56.830]  He's the owner, um, Denver, Colorado.
[28:57.430 --> 29:01.870]  You can look them up on Facebook and they also have an Instagram and they got
[29:01.870 --> 29:06.830]  the phone number at 1-800-508-1856.
[29:07.550 --> 29:11.990]  They can supply these little buckets of this volcanic
[29:12.390 --> 29:16.790]  rock dust. Uh, they come in 10 pound little pills. It's like a,
[29:17.870 --> 29:21.510]  like a half gallon paint pill. Okay. It weighs 10 pounds. Oh yeah.
[29:21.510 --> 29:24.670]  So there's a clue on how to show this. Um,
[29:25.510 --> 29:29.550]  they are, fuck, I can't even quote the price, but trust me,
[29:29.550 --> 29:33.990]  it's really cheap, especially considering it replaces all these other things.
[29:34.550 --> 29:38.950]  Like it lowers your price of growing significantly. Um,
[29:39.430 --> 29:43.470]  you know, at a place where I'm going 6,000 plants, you know,
[29:43.510 --> 29:48.390]  every basically we grow 6,000 plants every nine
[29:48.390 --> 29:52.230]  weeks out there. People can't even fathom that. Yeah. How, how,
[29:52.230 --> 29:57.190]  what size of pot are those plants in seven gallons? Okay. That's amazing.
[29:57.470 --> 30:01.870]  They go from a, uh, from a clone to four inch container. Um,
[30:01.990 --> 30:04.750]  it's like a nursery flat. Um, it's,
[30:04.750 --> 30:09.910]  it's roughly the size of like a big kid cup. Okay. Um, uh,
[30:10.110 --> 30:12.550]  and then it goes to two gallon poly form pot,
[30:13.230 --> 30:16.390]  also a nursery pot that fits in a tray and everything.
[30:16.550 --> 30:19.630]  All right. Both those containers fit in trace. Um,
[30:19.710 --> 30:22.310]  and then they go into a seven gallon smart pot. Nice.
[30:22.350 --> 30:26.470]  Oh those smart pots will make them grow like beasts. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Um,
[30:27.350 --> 30:28.310]  but uh, we,
[30:28.310 --> 30:33.310]  we literally cut out like fucking eight ingredients by using this
[30:33.310 --> 30:34.150]  shit. Nice.
[30:34.470 --> 30:38.150]  And that saves time in mixing when you're mixing for 6,000 plants. Yeah. Yeah.
[30:38.190 --> 30:40.590]  People don't realize how much water and how much mixing time that is.
[30:40.630 --> 30:45.310]  Saves time and paperwork saves time and ordering. But you know,
[30:45.310 --> 30:50.230]  it's not just that it actually is doing its job and it works better.
[30:50.350 --> 30:53.350]  Well, I liked the way I thought about it is this much weight is going to end up
[30:53.350 --> 30:55.630]  in my crop now. Yeah. Instead of just in that baggy,
[30:55.630 --> 30:57.190]  it's going to transfer right onto the buds.
[30:57.310 --> 31:00.430]  I actually heard an equation the other day cause we were trying to figure out
[31:00.450 --> 31:02.310]  how often we need to reamend it.
[31:02.830 --> 31:07.470]  So only about 3% of that is going to end up in each crop. Okay. Yeah.
[31:07.910 --> 31:12.710]  All right. That, I mean, you're not going to need to reamend it. Honestly,
[31:12.710 --> 31:17.110]  for if you're doing an outdoor, you know, possibly ever.
[31:17.310 --> 31:20.590]  Nice. Nice. One application in your set. Yeah. All right.
[31:20.590 --> 31:23.550]  What else are we going to put in this? Uh, native soil.
[31:24.990 --> 31:27.990]  I'll keep going. I almost cut you off. Keep going. No, you keep going. Sorry.
[31:27.990 --> 31:31.950]  I cut you off. Oh, we've got the, uh, we've got Pete and compost to get it soft.
[31:32.230 --> 31:35.670]  Uh, we started with clay or sand and we added the other one and some Pete and
[31:35.670 --> 31:40.230]  compost. We've got, let's say we've got neem cakes in there. Uh,
[31:40.230 --> 31:45.110]  we've got, we've got the volcanic rock dust or we've got oyster shell
[31:46.310 --> 31:47.790]  and or oyster shells.
[31:47.790 --> 31:51.510]  One of the ones that has properties that this can't completely replace. Okay.
[31:51.630 --> 31:53.910]  All right. One of the few things you will need, uh,
[31:53.910 --> 31:58.830]  is this basically going to be similar to a super soil? Yeah. Hell yeah. Okay.
[31:58.950 --> 32:03.550]  All right. Yeah. All right. Um, you can add kelp, alfalfa, crustacean mill,
[32:04.230 --> 32:08.550]  uh, good compost chicken, come, you know, chicken manure, seabird, guano,
[32:09.070 --> 32:11.470]  um, seabird guano would be cool. You know,
[32:14.070 --> 32:16.550]  we'll go into that another time. Okay. Yeah. I mean,
[32:16.590 --> 32:21.190]  if that's what's available to you, use it up. Um, I mean, soybean,
[32:21.270 --> 32:25.750]  soybean meal, feather meal, it's just, you want to balance out, you know,
[32:26.310 --> 32:31.310]  look at what you're adding in. You, you want basically shoot for a pretty good
[32:31.790 --> 32:35.590]  balance. You want to, you want a high calcium input. Um,
[32:36.470 --> 32:41.230]  the, this volcanic rocket ash would, you know, replace your need for,
[32:41.430 --> 32:45.790]  you know, if you don't use it, your need for azomite basalt, um,
[32:47.470 --> 32:48.310]  just shit.
[32:49.710 --> 32:54.230]  Tons of shit. Yeah. All of that stuff. Yeah. Um, but, uh,
[32:55.070 --> 32:58.150]  if you were using this, um, you know, you,
[32:58.150 --> 33:02.590]  you want pretty balanced nitrogens, um, you're, you know,
[33:02.590 --> 33:07.390]  along your MPK. So say blood meal, bone meal, uh,
[33:07.430 --> 33:10.870]  kelp mill off alpha male would be one possible combination, you know,
[33:10.870 --> 33:14.270]  it's just, and you'd want them in all even parts basically. Yeah. Okay.
[33:14.470 --> 33:15.590]  Think about what you're using.
[33:15.590 --> 33:18.550]  Follow the directions that are in the back of the bag. Uh,
[33:18.590 --> 33:23.030]  take the time to figure out how much soil you're actually working with. Um,
[33:23.790 --> 33:26.710]  no, if this is our first time working with the native soil and we've got our
[33:26.710 --> 33:30.310]  first pot plant in there and we know how to grow and we're watching it outside,
[33:30.310 --> 33:34.510]  what should we look for for signs of trouble that we fucked up that soil so we
[33:34.510 --> 33:35.990]  can try to fix our issues?
[33:39.870 --> 33:44.310]  I mean, if soil disappears or if water disappears through it really quick,
[33:44.950 --> 33:48.030]  it's still too sandy. Um, you know,
[33:48.030 --> 33:50.550]  if it appears that it's really low me at first,
[33:50.550 --> 33:53.750]  but after your water a few times, you know,
[33:54.070 --> 33:58.110]  if you're working with a really, really sandy soil, um,
[33:58.950 --> 34:02.750]  you're really going to want to add a lot, a lot of peat moss. Okay.
[34:02.950 --> 34:07.950]  Probably like one part native soil with three parts of peat moss. Okay. Yeah.
[34:08.030 --> 34:12.830]  All right. So, you know, a lot, uh, you can't really overdo Pete. Can you?
[34:14.310 --> 34:18.430]  No, not really. You're just going to be chopping out amendments. Yeah. Um,
[34:18.470 --> 34:21.750]  and especially if you know, you mulch it up really good. Uh,
[34:21.790 --> 34:26.630]  that's the big worry about mean about Pete Jesus, um,
[34:26.750 --> 34:30.590]  is that it's going to dry out really quick if it's not mulched up well.
[34:31.750 --> 34:36.870]  So that's another thing. Mulch is really important with native soils. Um,
[34:37.030 --> 34:39.030]  it helps keep the micro life going there.
[34:39.030 --> 34:43.510]  It helps with watering issues and everything. Okay.
[34:44.710 --> 34:47.590]  I've got a really random question. I feel like we've covered the native soil.
[34:47.710 --> 34:52.550]  We know how to do that. I hope so. You said, I apologize for any confusion.
[34:52.590 --> 34:55.390]  If not, let us know and we'll get together next week and we'll figure it all
[34:55.430 --> 34:57.790]  out. We may spark a bunch of questions. Yeah. Um,
[34:57.830 --> 35:02.830]  you said something about the worms are the best and it made me think of bees.
[35:03.430 --> 35:04.350]  But then I thought about,
[35:04.350 --> 35:06.990]  we grow cannabis and we don't want bees in our cannabis because bees are
[35:06.990 --> 35:10.230]  pollinators. No, that's not true. No. Okay. Yeah.
[35:10.270 --> 35:12.550]  Are bees cool to be around your cannabis plants? They're not gonna,
[35:12.630 --> 35:14.430]  they're not gonna pollinate. Um,
[35:15.150 --> 35:20.070]  a couple of places I grow at have multiple beehives and it's,
[35:20.790 --> 35:23.870]  um, female plants don't produce any pollen. Right.
[35:23.870 --> 35:26.830]  But some asshole around here has got a male outside is always my fear.
[35:28.630 --> 35:33.510]  Really unlikely. All right. Because if someone has a male, I mean,
[35:34.670 --> 35:37.430]  it's gotta be good enough to, for a beta,
[35:38.350 --> 35:40.470]  for its attention to be attracted. Okay.
[35:40.550 --> 35:45.030]  Bees only go after really healthy plants. All right. I mean, you know, they're,
[35:45.070 --> 35:47.350]  they're looking for the good premium stuff.
[35:47.390 --> 35:52.710]  They don't want some busted ass fucking Hermes plant. Like, man,
[35:52.710 --> 35:57.670]  I've never had a problem with it. I have seen a bee land on a bud,
[35:58.390 --> 36:01.950]  but it just kind of checked it out and flew away. It's like, eh, stinks.
[36:01.950 --> 36:05.350]  I'm out. All right. All right. I just, I, I know that people,
[36:05.830 --> 36:08.910]  some people aren't completely experienced growers and I know some people are
[36:08.910 --> 36:11.790]  going to throw some plants outdoors and I know one of them mills or one of them
[36:11.790 --> 36:15.310]  seeds will be a male and I hope they get it on time. And I just always wonder.
[36:15.590 --> 36:19.670]  All right. Well, there's a lot of misconceptions about pot.
[36:19.910 --> 36:22.510]  There's also a lot of misconceptions about bees.
[36:22.630 --> 36:27.270]  So you put them together and that's one huge double misconception. Yeah.
[36:27.950 --> 36:31.550]  Can we both agree that the bees making THC honey is total bullshit.
[36:31.630 --> 36:34.070]  Total bullshit. Total bullshit. Right. Yeah. Yeah. All right.
[36:35.150 --> 36:36.830]  What he was doing is a,
[36:38.550 --> 36:43.310]  commercial bee farmers feed their bees corn syrup in the winter because they
[36:43.310 --> 36:46.630]  stole all their honey from them, which is the bees natural food.
[36:47.630 --> 36:51.110]  Good holistic honey farmers don't do this.
[36:51.510 --> 36:56.150]  They only take a smaller yield instead of taking it all.
[36:56.590 --> 37:00.190]  The commercial farmers are like, well, we'll just feed them fucking corn syrup.
[37:00.590 --> 37:05.990]  Nasty. Okay. So this is actually part of what can to contributed to the,
[37:06.230 --> 37:08.390]  uh, colony collapse and everything.
[37:08.510 --> 37:13.510]  B die off is because their corn syrup is full of fucking roundup because you're
[37:14.030 --> 37:17.270]  getting the cheap fucking GMO fucking corn syrup.
[37:17.590 --> 37:21.950]  And it's not even food grade. It's the stuff that like, ah, ah,
[37:21.990 --> 37:25.190]  fuck the if it's our back, like give it a double dose. Like,
[37:25.790 --> 37:28.470]  cause it's, it's livestock grade. So it,
[37:28.550 --> 37:30.830]  it doesn't even have to be tested for that stuff.
[37:31.110 --> 37:35.190]  So the bees are eating roundup and of course it's fucking killing them off.
[37:36.430 --> 37:38.190]  Um, okay. So that dude in France,
[37:38.230 --> 37:42.830]  what he did is he took corn syrup and sprayed it on that fucking plant.
[37:43.790 --> 37:46.830]  There you go. The bees were trained to go to the fucking corn syrup.
[37:47.310 --> 37:49.150]  Like I have no scientific proof.
[37:49.190 --> 37:53.110]  I just kind of grew up on a like really big ass beef farm.
[37:54.430 --> 37:55.270]  Um,
[37:55.310 --> 38:00.070]  and I know how all that works and I watched that video and I know that bud looks
[38:00.070 --> 38:04.470]  really sticky and this is just my own conclusion,
[38:04.470 --> 38:05.950]  but I'm pretty sure that's what he did.
[38:06.110 --> 38:10.750]  That makes sense to me. Well, it's called THC. A the A stands for acid. Uh,
[38:10.790 --> 38:12.270]  have you ever been trimming and rubbed your eye?
[38:12.910 --> 38:15.310]  That's the worst fucking thing ever. It doesn't go away.
[38:15.310 --> 38:18.350]  It burns and it stings for like an hour and your eyes kind of stuck shut.
[38:18.550 --> 38:20.790]  Imagine a little tiny bee landed on there and tasting that.
[38:20.790 --> 38:24.270]  He's going to go fuck this and he's going to fly off. Yeah, that's,
[38:24.270 --> 38:25.110]  that was my first,
[38:25.510 --> 38:28.430]  the pH of that trichome is going to disrupt that bees whole life.
[38:30.390 --> 38:33.030]  Yeah. That was what I thought.
[38:33.230 --> 38:37.590]  I need to check what pH of a like most pollinators. Yeah. Yeah.
[38:37.670 --> 38:40.790]  That could actually be a really strong argument. Well, thank you.
[38:40.830 --> 38:44.790]  Thanks for supporting my statement. Honor. All right, dude.
[38:44.790 --> 38:47.470]  You said he wanted to do a 30 minute podcast cause you had something to handle.
[38:47.470 --> 38:49.550]  That was nearly 40 minutes ago. Nice.
[38:50.110 --> 38:53.470]  Do you have anything that you want to add to this before we wrap it up so that
[38:53.470 --> 38:54.870]  we can get you out of here to handle your business?
[38:54.990 --> 38:59.950]  Fuck. Um, I don't apologize for being a little buzz cause I like beer.
[39:00.470 --> 39:01.870]  Oh dude, you were a wonderful podcast.
[39:03.110 --> 39:05.590]  I told me you drink a couple of beers. I would've never known. Yeah, for sure.
[39:05.630 --> 39:09.750]  Well, this actually had some really good ones. So what kind of beers you drink?
[39:10.190 --> 39:14.430]  Um, Adele's pillow, which anyone that knows me knows that's my go to. Okay.
[39:14.550 --> 39:17.270]  But then I had a Odell's
[39:18.830 --> 39:21.670]  fuck. It's some kind of seasonal IPA. I can't remember what it was called.
[39:21.670 --> 39:25.430]  Was it the citrus one? No, no. Okay. New Belgium.
[39:26.190 --> 39:31.190]  All right. So I haven't drank in probably real men don't have fruit in their beer.
[39:31.470 --> 39:33.150]  That's I think that might be true. Yeah.
[39:33.190 --> 39:37.550]  I haven't drank any alcohol in eight ish years, eight to 10 ish years.
[39:37.870 --> 39:38.470]  Yeah. Yeah.
[39:38.470 --> 39:42.270]  And I only drank one time because I was with a boss at a job and he bought beers
[39:42.290 --> 39:44.070]  and he's like, have a beer with me. And I was like, I don't drink.
[39:44.070 --> 39:45.030]  And he's like, you do today.
[39:45.110 --> 39:48.470]  I remember when I didn't drink, I used to hate that situation.
[39:48.550 --> 39:51.870]  And you just get wasted from a beer. But I miss,
[39:52.030 --> 39:56.070]  I wish I could drink a Sammy Smith's oatmeal stout, not a Sam Adams,
[39:56.090 --> 39:59.550]  but Sammy Smith's the from England. They come in an Imperial pint. Oh,
[39:59.550 --> 40:01.710]  they've got the gold. Yeah.
[40:01.830 --> 40:03.230]  I've seen if you don't get the gold off,
[40:03.230 --> 40:05.030]  you drink it and you shit little gold in the morning.
[40:05.470 --> 40:08.590]  But they make an oatmeal stout and a Teddy Porter, bro.
[40:08.590 --> 40:12.230]  Those were the beers to go to when I would drink. I can't stand that IPA light.
[40:12.230 --> 40:13.430]  Shit. It tastes like pissed to me.
[40:13.430 --> 40:16.590]  I want a beer that's like maple syrup coming out of the fucking can.
[40:16.990 --> 40:21.110]  You got to hold that bottle upside down for a few minutes. Yeah. Yeah.
[40:21.150 --> 40:23.110]  Take a dab and then go try to take it, take a drink.
[40:23.110 --> 40:25.110]  And it might've poured out by now. That's what I like.
[40:25.190 --> 40:28.350]  I'm super into, I don't know. Um,
[40:28.990 --> 40:33.390]  I appreciate all beer except for like that beer,
[40:33.430 --> 40:37.350]  beer truck beers, what I call it. Yeah. That flat piss, hot water beer,
[40:37.470 --> 40:42.470]  anything imported from Mexico or is in a green bottle.
[40:42.950 --> 40:46.350]  You know, you don't want to drink it to Cate. No, dude, that shit's horrible.
[40:46.670 --> 40:49.750]  That shit's poison. You get diarrhea just from the beer, not the hangover.
[40:49.830 --> 40:55.150]  I totally, I can say 100%. I only support, um,
[40:55.590 --> 41:00.430]  local American breweries. Nice. Like real small, you know,
[41:00.790 --> 41:05.230]  cause even new Belgium compared to Budweiser is a small business in new
[41:05.230 --> 41:10.470]  Belgium. Sierra, Nevada. Oh, the blue label. Oh dude.
[41:10.470 --> 41:15.270]  Yeah. I used to drink a shit ton of that. Yeah. That and a steak baked potato.
[41:15.950 --> 41:19.630]  Yeah. Jesse's drooling. You guys, he's got a big man beard.
[41:19.630 --> 41:22.710]  Now it's coated in drool. It looks like a savage wolf. Uh,
[41:22.710 --> 41:24.830]  thanks for tolerating, tolerating a beer talk. You guys,
[41:24.830 --> 41:28.070]  I haven't talked about beer in a long time. Uh, drink if you'd like,
[41:28.110 --> 41:30.470]  I just can't do that. I cannot drink responsibly.
[41:30.790 --> 41:34.310]  That's how we make gross stones. Like they say on the Adam Dunn show, you know,
[41:34.470 --> 41:36.830]  when you're emptying beer bottles, you're making gross stones.
[41:36.870 --> 41:40.390]  There you go. Yeah. That's fucking funny. Uh, no, no.
[41:40.430 --> 41:43.510]  Alcohol and I do not get along. We're not friends, but if you can do that,
[41:43.550 --> 41:46.590]  you do that. Yeah. I can probably dab more than most people out there.
[41:47.270 --> 41:50.630]  Yeah. To each their own. Yes, absolutely. Um, but yeah,
[41:50.630 --> 41:52.190]  if I did leave anything out,
[41:52.350 --> 41:56.790]  leave anyone guessing or if you just want to ask some more questions, man,
[41:57.150 --> 41:58.950]  feel free to hit me or Jeff up.
[41:59.150 --> 42:02.670]  The best way is probably a grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[42:02.750 --> 42:06.590]  That comes right to my phone, my iPad, my computer pretty much rings in my head.
[42:06.910 --> 42:09.430]  I will see your message. You guys, a lot of people send me messages.
[42:09.430 --> 42:12.910]  I am getting to them. I don't always reply to your message directly.
[42:12.910 --> 42:14.910]  Sometimes they just reply on the show because I'm like, Hey,
[42:14.910 --> 42:16.830]  they're going to love that. Uh, so listen,
[42:17.190 --> 42:20.870]  and I've got a lot of emails in my phone that I haven't gotten to put podcasts
[42:20.870 --> 42:22.510]  together for yet, but it's going to happen.
[42:22.530 --> 42:24.810]  So even if you sent me a message like six months ago,
[42:24.810 --> 42:27.250]  it may pop up as a, as a podcast here in the future.
[42:27.650 --> 42:32.530]  For sure. Um, if you want, even if you're not social media type,
[42:32.810 --> 42:36.890]  you can hit me up on green chill genetics at
[42:36.890 --> 42:41.850]  gmail.com. All one word. That's old school. Yeah. The green chill.
[42:42.010 --> 42:44.970]  Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's wrap it up on the green chill. Ladies and gentlemen,
[42:44.970 --> 42:48.530]  I appreciate you guys for listening to a podcast about how to amend your native
[42:48.530 --> 42:50.410]  soil, wherever you are, whatever you're growing in,
[42:50.810 --> 42:54.730]  we can adjust it now to make it work for your cannabis crop. Uh, Jesse,
[42:54.730 --> 42:58.170]  thanks for coming and hanging out, dude. Hell yeah. Thanks for having me. Oh man.
[42:58.330 --> 43:01.370]  Can't look. Can't wait to see you. Uh, and I think I got drunk from you.
[43:01.570 --> 43:04.570]  I look forward and can't wait to seeing you in two weeks.
[43:04.570 --> 43:06.730]  That was harder to say than it should have been. Yeah.
[43:06.730 --> 43:10.810]  We'll be back here in two weeks. I want to give a huge shout out to Jesse's pops.
[43:11.530 --> 43:13.210]  Yeah. Yeah. Big shout out to that guy.
[43:13.490 --> 43:15.250]  I think that's all we've got for this week. Ladies and gentlemen,
[43:15.330 --> 43:16.970]  thank you again for listening until next time.
[43:16.970 --> 43:19.370]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[44:14.700 --> 44:15.900]  No sunglasses.
[44:15.900 --> 44:17.980]  As I step into the sun.
[44:18.980 --> 44:22.660]  There's no recollection of the evil things I've done.
[44:23.540 --> 44:26.140]  It feels like I must have had some fun.
[44:43.470 --> 44:45.630]  I remember I was chilling,
[44:47.540 --> 44:51.300]  pinching girlies asses. I was drinking recklessly.
[44:52.180 --> 44:54.500]  I don't know. I did something.
[44:54.500 --> 44:56.900]  Lord, what could it be?
[44:56.900 --> 44:59.500]  Welcome to the morning and all my friends say me.
[45:16.200 --> 45:36.730]  You got my face.
[45:36.730 --> 45:39.370]  My God, what is that awful smell?
[45:39.490 --> 45:41.890]  She may be an angel.
[45:41.890 --> 45:43.330]  She may be a queen.
[45:43.330 --> 45:47.010]  She might be black, white, American, Indian or Japanese.
[45:47.010 --> 45:54.040]  What happened?
[46:26.380 --> 46:27.380]  What happened?
