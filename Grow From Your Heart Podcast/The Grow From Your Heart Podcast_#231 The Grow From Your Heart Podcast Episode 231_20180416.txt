[00:00.000 --> 00:02.300]  Hey, everyone, this is Dab and Granny,
[00:02.300 --> 00:05.300]  and you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:20.940 --> 00:22.680]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:22.680 --> 00:24.400]  It's time for episode number 231
[00:24.400 --> 00:26.140]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:26.140 --> 00:29.280]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:30.200 --> 00:31.320]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:31.320 --> 00:32.560]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:32.560 --> 00:35.040]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:35.040 --> 00:36.440]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:36.440 --> 00:38.000]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:38.000 --> 00:39.960]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:39.960 --> 00:42.200]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:43.020 --> 00:45.180]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:45.180 --> 00:46.980]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:46.980 --> 00:49.260]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:49.260 --> 00:50.900]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:50.900 --> 00:53.420]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:53.420 --> 00:55.340]  Big shout out to Kat, Ku,
[00:55.340 --> 00:57.500]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:59.260 --> 01:02.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm dabbed out this evening.
[01:02.180 --> 01:03.140]  I'm having a great day.
[01:03.140 --> 01:05.540]  I hope you guys are having a good day also.
[01:05.540 --> 01:07.420]  Thank you for joining me.
[01:07.420 --> 01:09.260]  Let's talk about what I'm dabbing on.
[01:09.260 --> 01:11.420]  I just took a giant dab of some Lemon Jeffery
[01:11.440 --> 01:13.440]  high cannabinoid full spectrum extract
[01:13.440 --> 01:15.920]  with a little bit of high terp full spectrum extract
[01:15.920 --> 01:17.800]  poured into the banger.
[01:17.800 --> 01:19.720]  And it kinda changed my day.
[01:19.720 --> 01:21.880]  I wish you guys were here to dab with me.
[01:21.880 --> 01:23.320]  One of these days maybe, right?
[01:23.320 --> 01:25.080]  I wanna talk about a new toy I got you guys.
[01:25.080 --> 01:27.000]  I picked up a thing called a Thermal Banger.
[01:27.000 --> 01:28.720]  I've talked about a banger on the show before.
[01:28.720 --> 01:31.160]  A banger is basically, it attaches to a rig,
[01:31.160 --> 01:33.400]  which is basically a small bubbler or a pipe
[01:33.400 --> 01:34.280]  or maybe even a bong.
[01:34.280 --> 01:36.000]  I prefer a smaller bubbler,
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.720]  like a handheld sidecar size sort of bubbler thing.
[01:39.740 --> 01:42.940]  Google a Hitman Hammerhead sidecar.
[01:42.940 --> 01:44.780]  Those are some of my favorite rigs.
[01:44.780 --> 01:46.380]  They're affordable and I like the style
[01:46.380 --> 01:47.700]  and the function and the size and shape.
[01:47.700 --> 01:48.520]  It's perfect.
[01:48.520 --> 01:51.540]  But anyway, I got the 14 mil male attachment
[01:51.540 --> 01:53.340]  coming out here, the joint coming out.
[01:53.340 --> 01:54.460]  Then the banger attaches to that.
[01:54.460 --> 01:56.740]  It's got a 14 millimeter female.
[01:56.740 --> 01:59.020]  Then it comes up and it's got a 90 degree turn on it.
[01:59.020 --> 02:00.500]  Then on that it's got like a,
[02:00.500 --> 02:01.940]  it looks like maybe an upside down thimble.
[02:01.940 --> 02:03.900]  It's made out of glass, it's all glass.
[02:03.900 --> 02:04.860]  It looks like a thimble.
[02:04.860 --> 02:05.900]  And then on the inside of that
[02:05.900 --> 02:07.580]  is a smaller thimble on the inside.
[02:07.600 --> 02:09.000]  So it's maybe like a big,
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.040]  like a soda bottle lid or a water bottle lid.
[02:11.040 --> 02:12.480]  It's about that diameter.
[02:12.480 --> 02:13.600]  Then a little bit taller than that,
[02:13.600 --> 02:15.000]  maybe one and a half of those tall.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.840]  Then on the inside is another one,
[02:16.840 --> 02:18.800]  another cylinder, I guess you could say.
[02:18.800 --> 02:20.920]  It looks like a cup with a cup inside of it.
[02:20.920 --> 02:22.160]  A bowl with a cup inside of it.
[02:22.160 --> 02:23.600]  And you heat the outside
[02:23.600 --> 02:24.920]  and you put the dab on the inside one.
[02:24.920 --> 02:26.920]  And then you put, so when I bought it,
[02:26.920 --> 02:28.320]  they didn't have these caps available.
[02:28.320 --> 02:32.000]  I bought it over at Elevate Glass on 517 South Bay Hone.
[02:32.000 --> 02:33.840]  When I bought the Thermal Banger is what it's called,
[02:33.840 --> 02:35.000]  they didn't have these bubble caps.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  So I bought it and I took it home
[02:36.020 --> 02:37.660]  and I tried to take a dab with a normal carb cap
[02:37.660 --> 02:38.780]  and it just wasn't doing it for me.
[02:38.780 --> 02:40.780]  I set it aside like that kind of sucks.
[02:40.780 --> 02:41.700]  The next time I went to
[02:41.700 --> 02:43.560]  Higher Elevation's Masterpiece Productions,
[02:43.560 --> 02:46.740]  which is Elevate's sister store just across town,
[02:46.740 --> 02:48.140]  they're like, hey, how'd you like your Thermal Banger?
[02:48.140 --> 02:48.980]  I was like, it sucks.
[02:48.980 --> 02:50.300]  And they're like, do you have a bubble cap for it?
[02:50.300 --> 02:52.220]  And I was like, no sir, I do not.
[02:52.220 --> 02:53.780]  And they're like, let's get you a bubble cap for it.
[02:53.780 --> 02:55.860]  So now I've got a bubble cap.
[02:55.860 --> 02:57.180]  And let me tell you,
[02:57.180 --> 02:58.540]  the bubble cap and the Thermal Banger
[02:58.540 --> 03:00.100]  make an amazing fucking dab.
[03:00.100 --> 03:02.220]  I've been getting extra high lately.
[03:02.220 --> 03:04.340]  It makes the dabs, I already take gigantic dabs
[03:04.340 --> 03:05.540]  and it just makes the gigantic dab.
[03:06.080 --> 03:07.920]  I take seem even gigantic-er,
[03:07.920 --> 03:09.040]  which I know isn't even a word,
[03:09.040 --> 03:11.680]  but it is now when you dab with me.
[03:11.680 --> 03:13.440]  Take gigantic-er dabs.
[03:13.440 --> 03:14.880]  That should be a bumper sticker.
[03:14.880 --> 03:16.360]  Take gigantic-er dabs.
[03:16.360 --> 03:17.640]  It's good for you.
[03:17.640 --> 03:18.460]  Dabs are good for you.
[03:18.460 --> 03:19.800]  Anyway, let's talk about what I'm smoking on
[03:19.800 --> 03:20.840]  that's put me in this condition.
[03:20.840 --> 03:23.000]  I talked about the Lemon Jeffrey High Cannabinoid
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.760]  and High Terp Full Spectrum Extracts.
[03:24.760 --> 03:28.400]  I've also got some of the Stardog Ambrosia.
[03:28.400 --> 03:29.680]  I just held it up to the microphone
[03:29.680 --> 03:30.840]  like you guys would be able to smell it.
[03:30.840 --> 03:32.560]  That's how high that shit made me.
[03:32.560 --> 03:34.560]  Anyway, I've also got some Screamin' Tangerines,
[03:34.580 --> 03:36.860]  which smells, it just screams tangerines.
[03:36.860 --> 03:38.140]  When you dab that, the whole room
[03:38.140 --> 03:40.340]  smells like a tangerine for a little bit.
[03:40.340 --> 03:42.180]  I've also got the Gorilla Glue we talked about
[03:42.180 --> 03:43.540]  on a previous episode.
[03:43.540 --> 03:44.900]  I went back and bought more
[03:44.900 --> 03:46.380]  because I like what it does to my face.
[03:46.380 --> 03:47.260]  It makes me nice and high.
[03:47.260 --> 03:52.260]  That's my, the lemony stuff is the medical cannabis for me.
[03:52.620 --> 03:54.740]  Let me turn this music down so I can think a little better.
[03:54.740 --> 03:55.860]  I think that when I'm dabbing stuff
[03:55.860 --> 03:57.680]  that has citrus and lemons,
[03:57.680 --> 03:58.980]  that's kind of more medical for me.
[03:58.980 --> 04:01.540]  When I smoke this gassy-flavored stuff, that's recreational.
[04:01.540 --> 04:03.700]  That gives me a recreational high.
[04:03.720 --> 04:06.320]  Trust me, I think if I take enough dabs of any strain,
[04:06.320 --> 04:07.760]  it becomes recreational.
[04:07.760 --> 04:09.760]  But still, recreational use is medical use
[04:09.760 --> 04:11.760]  because if it makes you feel better,
[04:11.760 --> 04:13.080]  it makes you feel better.
[04:13.080 --> 04:15.320]  It's mental health, it's physical health, it's all related.
[04:15.320 --> 04:17.900]  Anyway, the Gorilla Glue gets me really high.
[04:17.900 --> 04:21.280]  They had some, oh, I've got some Stardog Batter also.
[04:21.280 --> 04:22.280]  What else do we have sitting here?
[04:22.280 --> 04:23.100]  Some Clementine.
[04:23.100 --> 04:23.940]  I like this Clementine.
[04:23.940 --> 04:26.000]  It's more flavor than it gets me high,
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.880]  but maybe that's because it's fixing something
[04:27.880 --> 04:28.920]  that I'm not noticing.
[04:28.920 --> 04:31.920]  But I really do enjoy the flavor of the Clementine.
[04:31.920 --> 04:33.460]  And also, what did I get?
[04:34.080 --> 04:38.120]  The Sour Amnesia, it smelled really good in the jar,
[04:38.120 --> 04:39.400]  and it smells pretty good in the jar.
[04:39.400 --> 04:41.540]  I've stirred it up and I've dabbed out of it a lot.
[04:41.540 --> 04:44.040]  But the flavor, I'm smelling it again.
[04:44.040 --> 04:46.080]  The flavor just doesn't come through in a dab.
[04:46.080 --> 04:48.600]  It doesn't, that flavor, I was hoping a different,
[04:48.600 --> 04:49.820]  there would be more flavor to it.
[04:49.820 --> 04:51.720]  The high is okay, it's acceptable.
[04:51.720 --> 04:53.920]  But that flavor just didn't come through,
[04:53.920 --> 04:55.120]  and that was what I bought it for.
[04:55.120 --> 04:56.920]  Anyway, I've got a whole bunch of Tasty Hasher.
[04:56.920 --> 04:59.460]  I've been dabbing a whole smorgasbord of it today.
[04:59.460 --> 05:01.880]  I've also got some Lemon Jeffrey Terps,
[05:01.880 --> 05:03.520]  and I've got some of the Clementine Terps.
[05:03.520 --> 05:06.580]  So I dunked a little bit of the Clementine batter
[05:06.580 --> 05:09.820]  into the Clementine Terps and took a little dab of that.
[05:09.820 --> 05:11.600]  That citrus flavor is always nice.
[05:11.600 --> 05:14.300]  I've learned that if I overheat the Clementine,
[05:14.300 --> 05:16.820]  if a Clementine dab gets too hot, in my opinion,
[05:16.820 --> 05:19.420]  it tastes a little bit like orange chicken
[05:19.420 --> 05:22.380]  or some sort of orange-flavored Chinese food,
[05:22.380 --> 05:24.580]  which I know sounds weird because I don't even eat chicken,
[05:24.580 --> 05:27.380]  but it tastes like some kind of Chinese food
[05:27.380 --> 05:28.340]  is what it reminds me of.
[05:28.340 --> 05:31.300]  That orange syrupy thing, that sticky orange syrup
[05:31.320 --> 05:33.960]  that comes on Chinese food, maybe I'm crazy.
[05:33.960 --> 05:37.640]  No, I certainly am crazy, but maybe that opinion is crazy
[05:37.640 --> 05:38.540]  because I'm gonna take a quick drink.
[05:38.540 --> 05:39.840]  I'm not even gonna press pause.
[05:39.840 --> 05:41.200]  Just gonna take a drink, moisten up the throat,
[05:41.200 --> 05:42.600]  and we'll keep talking here.
[05:47.810 --> 05:49.170]  All right, hopefully that keeps me going
[05:49.170 --> 05:51.010]  for a couple of minutes.
[05:51.010 --> 05:53.590]  So let's update you guys on a breeding project.
[05:53.590 --> 05:55.010]  I've been talking about a breeding project
[05:55.010 --> 05:57.210]  quite frequently on the podcast,
[05:57.210 --> 05:58.890]  and I am proud to say that those seeds
[05:58.890 --> 06:00.810]  have been successfully harvested.
[06:00.810 --> 06:03.290]  There are quite a few great new crosses.
[06:03.290 --> 06:04.450]  Some of them were just testers
[06:04.470 --> 06:06.510]  that'll probably be kept privately for myself.
[06:06.510 --> 06:07.950]  The Platinum Tangy to Arise,
[06:07.950 --> 06:10.590]  I don't know how much that'll get spread out.
[06:10.590 --> 06:12.430]  That'll probably stay right here in my vault.
[06:12.430 --> 06:13.910]  I'll grow those out, find the great ones,
[06:13.910 --> 06:16.150]  and then maybe breed with or to that.
[06:16.150 --> 06:17.850]  The Chem4 to Arise won't go too far,
[06:17.850 --> 06:21.150]  but things I do plan on making for a production run,
[06:21.150 --> 06:21.990]  I have to test them, you guys.
[06:21.990 --> 06:23.150]  I have to see if they're worth a shit,
[06:23.150 --> 06:24.310]  but something, I know they'll be good
[06:24.310 --> 06:26.910]  just because I'm a good breeder, I have a good intuition.
[06:26.910 --> 06:28.630]  I grow from my heart, breed with love.
[06:28.630 --> 06:29.790]  I know these are gonna be well.
[06:29.790 --> 06:33.150]  The Capleton to Arise, the Kalonji to Arise,
[06:33.150 --> 06:35.570]  Flow to Arise, those things are gonna be bred.
[06:35.570 --> 06:37.030]  I'm sure that those will get released
[06:37.030 --> 06:39.290]  because I like to make a lot of those.
[06:39.290 --> 06:40.570]  The Platinum Tangy was just kind of
[06:40.570 --> 06:42.650]  a personal project for myself.
[06:42.650 --> 06:44.570]  The Platinum Tangy, the Chem4,
[06:44.570 --> 06:45.770]  a couple of those won't go anywhere,
[06:45.770 --> 06:49.630]  but Capleton, Flow, Kalonji Kush,
[06:49.630 --> 06:52.010]  maybe even the Red-Headed Stranger to Arise.
[06:52.010 --> 06:53.370]  But like I said, I gotta test them all,
[06:53.370 --> 06:54.210]  see if they're worth a shit
[06:54.210 --> 06:55.970]  before I let anybody even touch them.
[06:55.970 --> 06:56.930]  Once I've tested a few,
[06:56.930 --> 06:58.930]  I'll give them out to other people to test.
[06:58.930 --> 07:00.530]  So they'll go through two or three rounds of testing
[07:00.550 --> 07:03.310]  before they will ever even be given out as freebies
[07:03.310 --> 07:04.850]  or for sale anywhere.
[07:04.850 --> 07:05.950]  So that'll be a while.
[07:06.830 --> 07:08.910]  But there's a lot of whole new great shit.
[07:08.910 --> 07:12.430]  There's Jeff's OG to Arise, Hell's OG to Arise,
[07:12.430 --> 07:17.230]  Kalonji Kush, Cannadential, Chem4, Critical Mass,
[07:17.230 --> 07:20.070]  Platinum Tangy, did a whole bunch of cool stuff to Arise.
[07:21.650 --> 07:24.190]  So the way I did it this time, I cut down the plant,
[07:24.190 --> 07:25.630]  I defoliated it heavily.
[07:25.630 --> 07:27.750]  I took almost all of the leaves off of the plant.
[07:27.750 --> 07:29.950]  Then I bucked the buds off of the sticks,
[07:30.370 --> 07:32.570]  and then I just put all of the buds into Tupperware dishes
[07:32.570 --> 07:35.370]  and they're carefully labeled with what plant they are.
[07:35.370 --> 07:37.150]  And they're all sitting in a little area.
[07:37.150 --> 07:38.250]  They're just drying out now.
[07:38.250 --> 07:40.970]  And when they dry, I will go and just crumble them up
[07:40.970 --> 07:42.410]  into the little Tupperware dish they're in.
[07:42.410 --> 07:43.930]  Then you just basically tip it to the side
[07:43.930 --> 07:44.770]  and all the seeds roll out
[07:44.770 --> 07:46.330]  and all the bud stays up at the top.
[07:46.330 --> 07:48.010]  You just gather up all the seeds, put them in a jar,
[07:48.010 --> 07:50.050]  label it, and then I go through in the future
[07:50.050 --> 07:51.650]  and sort out all the bad looking seeds.
[07:51.650 --> 07:54.890]  And those go to, they actually end up as bird feed,
[07:54.890 --> 07:55.810]  or I just throw them away,
[07:55.810 --> 07:57.450]  or they end up as chicken feed mainly.
[07:57.450 --> 07:58.810]  They go into the mix with the chicken feed
[07:58.830 --> 08:00.070]  just to make you go a little bit further.
[08:00.070 --> 08:00.910]  There's not a lot of them,
[08:00.910 --> 08:01.950]  but something's gotta happen with them.
[08:01.950 --> 08:03.310]  So they just get thrown in with the chicken feed
[08:03.310 --> 08:04.310]  or with the bird feed.
[08:04.310 --> 08:05.470]  Not my chickens or my birds.
[08:05.470 --> 08:07.230]  They get taken somewhere else for that.
[08:07.230 --> 08:10.790]  What else was I gonna say about the breeding project?
[08:10.790 --> 08:12.790]  Oh, here we go.
[08:12.790 --> 08:14.750]  If you're breeding with multiple females
[08:14.750 --> 08:17.670]  and one male in a room, timing is a bitch.
[08:17.670 --> 08:19.070]  The lemon skunk that I bred with,
[08:19.070 --> 08:20.430]  yes, I did breed two lemon skunk
[08:20.430 --> 08:21.590]  to make more firefly seeds.
[08:21.590 --> 08:23.910]  And I also made more morning dew seeds.
[08:23.910 --> 08:26.310]  The grateful dog to a rise, there's more of that.
[08:26.330 --> 08:29.050]  The lemon skunk to a rise, there's plenty more of that.
[08:29.050 --> 08:29.890]  But what I was gonna say,
[08:29.890 --> 08:31.610]  the lemon skunk is a really strong sativa.
[08:31.610 --> 08:34.130]  It takes longer than almost everything else
[08:34.130 --> 08:35.810]  in that room to flower.
[08:35.810 --> 08:38.130]  And it really showed me that when I tried to breed with it.
[08:38.130 --> 08:40.590]  I should have put that plant into flower
[08:40.590 --> 08:43.090]  a week to 10 days before everything else,
[08:43.090 --> 08:44.250]  and it would have made more seeds.
[08:44.250 --> 08:46.410]  It made a very minimal amount of seeds
[08:46.410 --> 08:48.050]  because I tried to time it with everything else.
[08:48.050 --> 08:50.290]  So my advice to you is if you're going to breed,
[08:50.290 --> 08:52.250]  in the future I do have an email about breeding
[08:52.250 --> 08:53.090]  and I'm going to get to it.
[08:53.090 --> 08:54.530]  I'm just overwhelmed with emails.
[08:54.530 --> 08:56.130]  I'm working my way through them.
[08:56.790 --> 08:58.150]  When you do breed,
[08:58.150 --> 09:00.670]  think more about plants that time up better
[09:00.670 --> 09:05.510]  because I put a 72 day plant in with 56 and 60 day plants
[09:05.510 --> 09:08.790]  and tried to breed and it kind of fucked up.
[09:08.790 --> 09:10.190]  It didn't do anything wrong.
[09:10.190 --> 09:12.150]  Everything probably made like a thousand seeds
[09:12.150 --> 09:13.810]  and this one made like 500.
[09:13.810 --> 09:14.990]  That's what went wrong.
[09:14.990 --> 09:16.230]  And the ones that are running...
[09:16.230 --> 09:18.270]  So did I tell you guys that I was breeding in cups?
[09:18.270 --> 09:19.910]  Most of my plants in the breeding project
[09:19.910 --> 09:21.590]  were in larger pots,
[09:21.590 --> 09:23.790]  but I had some that I just wanted to make a few for myself.
[09:23.790 --> 09:24.710]  Like we talked about earlier,
[09:24.710 --> 09:26.570]  the platinum tangy, the chem four,
[09:26.570 --> 09:28.290]  those plants were in beer cups, you guys.
[09:28.290 --> 09:30.230]  I had them on a table in a beer cup
[09:30.230 --> 09:32.370]  and I flowered them all the way out in the beer cup.
[09:32.370 --> 09:34.290]  I bred to them in a beer cup.
[09:34.290 --> 09:37.010]  They made about 50 seeds each plant.
[09:37.010 --> 09:37.850]  And as a breeder,
[09:37.850 --> 09:40.130]  that's all I need for myself to do plenty of stuff.
[09:40.130 --> 09:41.530]  So if you're looking to breed,
[09:41.530 --> 09:42.450]  don't be intimidated.
[09:42.450 --> 09:43.270]  Don't be afraid.
[09:43.270 --> 09:44.530]  You can do it in very small pots
[09:44.530 --> 09:47.850]  and make 50 to a hundred seeds for yourself with no problem.
[09:47.850 --> 09:50.210]  So that's really easy to do.
[09:50.210 --> 09:52.330]  I wouldn't breed under anything smaller
[09:52.330 --> 09:53.410]  than a 600 watt light.
[09:53.430 --> 09:54.590]  I tried to breed with the 400
[09:54.590 --> 09:56.710]  and it didn't make shit for seeds.
[09:56.710 --> 09:57.870]  The 600 did okay.
[09:57.870 --> 09:59.350]  Honestly, a thousand is where it's at
[09:59.350 --> 10:02.750]  if you're trying to breed and make healthy, solid seeds.
[10:02.750 --> 10:04.030]  So you can do small pots.
[10:04.030 --> 10:06.570]  If you just want to do like a five by five space of cups
[10:06.570 --> 10:07.670]  or three gallon pots,
[10:07.670 --> 10:09.830]  or I like six inch net pots,
[10:09.830 --> 10:10.670]  however you want to do it.
[10:10.670 --> 10:12.510]  You don't have to go big to do a breeding project.
[10:12.510 --> 10:14.070]  The timing is the crucial part
[10:14.070 --> 10:15.710]  is what I think I was trying to say
[10:15.710 --> 10:17.710]  when I got off on a rant.
[10:17.710 --> 10:20.910]  Anyway, the seed project has been harvested.
[10:20.910 --> 10:22.750]  What's my next order of business?
[10:22.770 --> 10:24.570]  I owe a shout out to a couple
[10:24.570 --> 10:26.570]  of really kind and generous people.
[10:26.570 --> 10:27.410]  I wanna give a shout out.
[10:27.410 --> 10:29.450]  I'm not sure if either of these guys
[10:29.450 --> 10:30.430]  want me to say their names
[10:30.430 --> 10:32.610]  because they have contributed on Patreon
[10:32.610 --> 10:33.930]  and I try to keep it kind of private
[10:33.930 --> 10:35.690]  and not blast everybody's name.
[10:35.690 --> 10:38.970]  But big shout out to John B and Steven P,
[10:38.970 --> 10:40.410]  Patreon contributors.
[10:40.410 --> 10:43.530]  They have made very generous Patreon contributions
[10:43.530 --> 10:44.930]  for a couple of months now.
[10:44.930 --> 10:46.410]  It does not go unnoticed.
[10:46.410 --> 10:48.870]  If you guys ever have questions or anything like that,
[10:48.870 --> 10:49.930]  make sure you email them to me
[10:49.930 --> 10:51.290]  and let me know who you are.
[10:51.290 --> 10:53.930]  Remind me that you're John B and Steven P from Patreon
[10:53.930 --> 10:55.270]  and I'll definitely get your questions
[10:55.270 --> 10:57.470]  to the top of the list and try to help you guys out.
[10:57.470 --> 11:01.150]  I completely appreciate your generosity and support.
[11:01.150 --> 11:02.910]  That shows me that you guys trust me
[11:02.910 --> 11:04.390]  and that you believe in me
[11:04.390 --> 11:05.870]  and that I'm helping you out in some sort of way
[11:05.870 --> 11:06.950]  and that means a lot to me.
[11:06.950 --> 11:07.790]  That means more to me.
[11:07.790 --> 11:08.990]  I appreciate the contribution,
[11:08.990 --> 11:10.710]  but if you're gonna throw that at me,
[11:10.710 --> 11:12.190]  that means that you trust me and you believe in me.
[11:12.190 --> 11:13.010]  So thank you.
[11:13.010 --> 11:13.850]  That means a lot to me.
[11:13.850 --> 11:15.670]  To a guy putting out a podcast every week,
[11:15.670 --> 11:17.630]  that makes it well worth it.
[11:17.630 --> 11:19.070]  All right, let me tell you about Patreon
[11:19.090 --> 11:22.170]  since I'm thanking dudes for contributing to Patreon.
[11:22.170 --> 11:23.250]  Patreon is a website.
[11:23.250 --> 11:25.850]  Patreon is also a service that allows you as a listener
[11:25.850 --> 11:27.970]  to financially contribute to the podcast.
[11:27.970 --> 11:28.790]  That's right.
[11:28.790 --> 11:29.630]  I'm not trying to beg for money,
[11:29.630 --> 11:32.490]  but if you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks,
[11:32.490 --> 11:34.450]  if you feel like my time, my effort, my energy,
[11:34.450 --> 11:36.770]  my guidance, my support, my knowledge, my help,
[11:36.770 --> 11:38.530]  my consultations were worth a couple of bucks,
[11:38.530 --> 11:41.730]  you can go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart
[11:41.730 --> 11:43.670]  and all the information that you need will be right there.
[11:43.670 --> 11:46.450]  You can sign up to become a Patreon contributor
[11:46.630 --> 11:49.390]  and that will allow you to contribute to the show.
[11:49.390 --> 11:50.590]  What that would do for me,
[11:50.590 --> 11:51.930]  honestly, I will use those funds
[11:51.930 --> 11:53.430]  to pay for the cost of my website.
[11:53.430 --> 11:55.630]  I have a website which is where I host this podcast.
[11:55.630 --> 11:58.110]  It does cost me a few bucks every year to keep that up.
[11:58.110 --> 12:01.110]  I post a lot of content, so there's a lot of bandwidth.
[12:01.110 --> 12:03.350]  There's a lot of storage that I pay for.
[12:03.350 --> 12:05.710]  There are 230 episodes of the podcast.
[12:05.710 --> 12:07.090]  That means that there are,
[12:07.090 --> 12:08.950]  the hundred of them are available in the feed.
[12:08.950 --> 12:11.430]  If I can learn how to make my website show more,
[12:11.430 --> 12:12.270]  I'll put them all up there.
[12:12.270 --> 12:13.690]  I just cannot learn how to do that.
[12:13.690 --> 12:15.270]  My web guide doesn't know how to do it.
[12:15.290 --> 12:17.610]  If we can figure out how to get all 231 available,
[12:17.610 --> 12:19.070]  they would be there on the website for you.
[12:19.070 --> 12:20.410]  I just don't know how to make that.
[12:20.410 --> 12:22.250]  Can't find that damn button to click yet.
[12:22.250 --> 12:23.370]  Anyway, it's gotta be there somewhere.
[12:23.370 --> 12:24.690]  But what I'll do with your funds
[12:24.690 --> 12:26.690]  is maybe I'll pay somebody who's better at web hosting.
[12:26.690 --> 12:27.730]  I'm just kidding, my guy is good.
[12:27.730 --> 12:28.570]  He's just busy.
[12:29.370 --> 12:30.690]  But I will pay for the website
[12:30.690 --> 12:31.950]  with the funds that you send my way.
[12:31.950 --> 12:33.650]  I also, these little microphone covers,
[12:33.650 --> 12:34.730]  I'm rubbing this one right here.
[12:34.730 --> 12:36.050]  I have guests on the show quite often.
[12:36.050 --> 12:37.950]  I try to replace these when Mike comes over.
[12:37.950 --> 12:40.610]  I try not to make Mike use the same microphone cover
[12:40.610 --> 12:42.450]  that maybe Granny or Lindsey or Chris,
[12:42.450 --> 12:44.570]  whoever else has been on the show in the past.
[12:44.590 --> 12:45.550]  I try not to make them share.
[12:45.550 --> 12:47.070]  I think that kind of gets a little funky
[12:47.070 --> 12:48.550]  if you have them on there for too long.
[12:48.550 --> 12:50.390]  I can smell my own if I use it for too long.
[12:50.390 --> 12:51.310]  And if I can smell my own,
[12:51.310 --> 12:53.710]  that means other people can smell other people's even sooner.
[12:53.710 --> 12:54.870]  And that's just gross to do that to them.
[12:54.870 --> 12:57.530]  So I swap out these microphone covers.
[12:57.530 --> 12:59.430]  I also have to buy new memory cards
[12:59.430 --> 13:00.950]  from my Zoom H6 occasionally
[13:00.950 --> 13:03.110]  because it eats them for some reason.
[13:03.110 --> 13:04.530]  Just basic stuff like that.
[13:04.530 --> 13:06.630]  I'm not begging, but if you feel like you wanna contribute,
[13:06.630 --> 13:07.630]  that's what it would help me with
[13:07.630 --> 13:09.110]  and I would appreciate it.
[13:09.110 --> 13:10.270]  Also, there's little things on there too
[13:10.270 --> 13:12.590]  where if you donate, if you contribute a certain amount,
[13:12.590 --> 13:15.610]  it puts you in line to get your questions answered first.
[13:15.610 --> 13:16.970]  Email me or something when you do that
[13:16.970 --> 13:17.890]  and let me know that you did that
[13:17.890 --> 13:20.570]  because Patreon isn't good at notifying me of that stuff.
[13:20.570 --> 13:22.130]  I have to go check every month.
[13:22.130 --> 13:22.970]  So send me an email and say,
[13:22.970 --> 13:25.890]  hey dude, I just contributed this much on Patreon
[13:25.890 --> 13:27.730]  and I would like my question answered and I will get it.
[13:27.730 --> 13:28.930]  I'll put you right at the top of the list.
[13:28.930 --> 13:30.250]  I'll print your email out
[13:30.250 --> 13:32.170]  and then I will write on it, Patreon.
[13:32.170 --> 13:33.530]  Then I'll make sure to give you a shout out
[13:33.530 --> 13:35.170]  and I will also read your email sooner.
[13:35.170 --> 13:37.330]  So patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[13:37.330 --> 13:38.590]  That would allow you as a listener
[13:38.590 --> 13:40.370]  to financially contribute to the podcast.
[13:40.370 --> 13:41.310]  Now I will quit begging
[13:41.310 --> 13:44.030]  and we'll move forward with the podcast.
[13:44.030 --> 13:46.350]  What else has been going on in the world of Rasta Jeff
[13:46.350 --> 13:49.590]  and iRegenetics and the Grow From Your Heart podcast?
[13:49.590 --> 13:51.250]  For those of you who do not know,
[13:51.250 --> 13:54.390]  I am the lead cultivator for Three Rivers.
[13:54.390 --> 13:56.730]  There's a dispensary in Pueblo called Three Rivers.
[13:56.730 --> 13:59.430]  We have a medical side and a recreational side.
[13:59.430 --> 14:00.430]  If you live in Colorado
[14:00.430 --> 14:01.950]  and you're a medical marijuana patient,
[14:01.950 --> 14:03.330]  you can shop on the medical side.
[14:03.330 --> 14:05.470]  If you do not have your medical marijuana recommendation
[14:05.470 --> 14:07.550]  from a doctor, if you're coming from out of state
[14:07.550 --> 14:08.830]  and you're 21 and over,
[14:08.830 --> 14:11.690]  you are allowed to shop on the recreational side.
[14:11.690 --> 14:12.530]  I think I said that right,
[14:12.530 --> 14:14.650]  the medical side and the recreational side.
[14:14.650 --> 14:16.970]  But I am currently running the grow for the medical side.
[14:16.970 --> 14:18.890]  We are building a very large facility
[14:18.890 --> 14:21.430]  that will host more medical and our recreational grow
[14:21.430 --> 14:23.890]  and I will be running that grow as well.
[14:24.950 --> 14:27.890]  Recently, we had a volunteer inspection,
[14:27.890 --> 14:31.510]  a compliance inspection from the Department of Agriculture.
[14:31.510 --> 14:34.230]  If you run or work in a large grow in Colorado,
[14:34.230 --> 14:36.010]  any type of grow, if you're growing tomatoes,
[14:36.010 --> 14:37.970]  if you're growing lettuce, if you're growing,
[14:38.150 --> 14:40.870]  what do they have down there, cantaloupes or peaches?
[14:40.870 --> 14:42.490]  But cannabis right now is where they're focused.
[14:42.490 --> 14:43.430]  But if you're growing anything,
[14:43.430 --> 14:45.830]  if you have a farm that's licensed,
[14:45.830 --> 14:47.430]  you will be visited and inspected
[14:47.430 --> 14:49.810]  by the Colorado Department of Agriculture.
[14:49.810 --> 14:52.030]  Their goal and their main mission is to make sure
[14:52.030 --> 14:55.630]  that you are not putting any humans or animals in danger.
[14:55.630 --> 14:57.290]  They don't want you to kill animals,
[14:57.290 --> 14:58.470]  they don't want you to kill people
[14:58.470 --> 15:00.150]  and they don't want you to kill the environment.
[15:00.150 --> 15:01.630]  That is their main goal.
[15:01.630 --> 15:03.110]  It was a little nerve wracking when I was told,
[15:03.110 --> 15:04.570]  hey, the Department of Agriculture
[15:04.570 --> 15:06.070]  is coming to inspect your facility.
[15:06.090 --> 15:08.450]  To tell you the truth, I got like, oh, what is that like?
[15:08.450 --> 15:09.730]  But I have a compliance officer
[15:09.730 --> 15:11.770]  that guides me through things at the grow.
[15:11.770 --> 15:13.970]  And we got together and they make a checklist.
[15:13.970 --> 15:16.650]  The Department of Ag makes it very easy.
[15:16.650 --> 15:18.290]  They make a checklist that you can go through
[15:18.290 --> 15:20.550]  and make sure that everything is in order.
[15:20.550 --> 15:22.130]  They tell you what you are allowed
[15:22.130 --> 15:23.810]  and are not allowed to have on premises.
[15:23.810 --> 15:25.970]  They tell you what you are and are not allowed to do.
[15:25.970 --> 15:28.490]  And as long as you're following basic safety rules,
[15:28.490 --> 15:30.410]  you're already doing these things.
[15:30.410 --> 15:32.370]  I have been trained in worker protection safety
[15:32.370 --> 15:34.170]  by the Department of Agriculture.
[15:34.170 --> 15:36.010]  So I already knew what I needed to look for
[15:36.830 --> 15:38.590]  and prepare for and what I needed to train my guys on.
[15:38.590 --> 15:40.590]  So these guys, if you have a grow,
[15:40.590 --> 15:43.230]  they will be at your, if you're running a cannabis grow,
[15:43.230 --> 15:45.770]  they will be at your cannabis grow eventually.
[15:45.770 --> 15:49.050]  If they have not been there, I recommend that you call
[15:49.050 --> 15:52.710]  and you schedule a voluntary compliance check.
[15:52.710 --> 15:55.230]  If they come for a voluntary compliance check,
[15:55.230 --> 15:57.350]  unless they see, I think the guy said he's looking
[15:57.350 --> 15:59.770]  for anything that would cause immediate threat
[15:59.770 --> 16:01.790]  to human or animal safety.
[16:01.790 --> 16:04.270]  Unless they see anything that's a blatant fuck up,
[16:04.290 --> 16:06.210]  unless you're doing something stupid,
[16:06.210 --> 16:09.110]  if you call for a voluntary compliance check,
[16:09.110 --> 16:12.090]  they are not going to write you up or fine you for anything.
[16:12.090 --> 16:13.630]  We didn't have anything to be written up for,
[16:13.630 --> 16:15.030]  but they were very happy with us.
[16:15.030 --> 16:17.570]  And they said, hey, we want you guys to call
[16:17.570 --> 16:19.990]  so that we can come out here and tell you what to do
[16:19.990 --> 16:22.230]  because you don't know what you're doing wrong
[16:22.230 --> 16:23.750]  until you're corrected.
[16:23.750 --> 16:25.430]  So if you've got a facility,
[16:25.430 --> 16:26.530]  I would recommend you call
[16:26.530 --> 16:28.230]  the Colorado Department of Agriculture
[16:28.230 --> 16:30.050]  and schedule a compliance check,
[16:30.050 --> 16:31.930]  a voluntary compliance check.
[16:31.930 --> 16:34.390]  This could prevent the things like we spoke about
[16:34.390 --> 16:37.150]  in a previous episode where people were not applying
[16:37.150 --> 16:39.730]  the proper pesticides or not applying them properly.
[16:39.730 --> 16:40.810]  If somebody would have came out there
[16:40.810 --> 16:42.170]  and spoke with those folks,
[16:42.170 --> 16:43.290]  they could have gotten it correct
[16:43.290 --> 16:46.010]  and they would not have had as large of a problem.
[16:46.010 --> 16:47.750]  If you schedule them to come out there,
[16:47.750 --> 16:49.010]  they'll come out there and look at your grow.
[16:49.010 --> 16:51.010]  All they did, they looked at our pesticide logs.
[16:51.010 --> 16:52.530]  I'm not sure how much I'm supposed to talk about.
[16:52.530 --> 16:54.170]  They looked at our pesticide logs.
[16:54.170 --> 16:56.890]  They looked for our MSDS logs,
[16:56.890 --> 16:58.850]  which is the material safety data sheets.
[16:58.850 --> 17:00.730]  You have to have every pesticide and product
[17:00.730 --> 17:01.730]  that's in the grow.
[17:02.530 --> 17:04.970]  You have to have a material safety data sheet available
[17:04.970 --> 17:06.070]  in a central location.
[17:06.070 --> 17:08.130]  They made sure we had eye wash stations.
[17:08.130 --> 17:10.130]  They honestly didn't even check for fire extinguishers.
[17:10.130 --> 17:12.510]  We had fire extinguishers in all the proper places.
[17:12.510 --> 17:13.970]  They did not even check for those.
[17:13.970 --> 17:15.570]  They asked us a lot of questions
[17:15.570 --> 17:18.370]  about our pesticide application procedures.
[17:18.370 --> 17:19.210]  How do you do it?
[17:19.210 --> 17:20.030]  Where do you do it?
[17:20.030 --> 17:21.730]  What do you wear when you do it?
[17:21.730 --> 17:23.170]  They just basically wanted to make sure
[17:23.170 --> 17:25.610]  that we were doing everything safely and correctly.
[17:25.610 --> 17:26.730]  There were a couple of things he's like,
[17:26.730 --> 17:27.570]  hey, you do that right,
[17:27.570 --> 17:29.090]  but have you ever thought about this?
[17:29.090 --> 17:30.670]  And then he would encourage thought in my mind
[17:30.670 --> 17:32.670]  and he would make me think of a better, safer,
[17:32.670 --> 17:34.390]  more practical way to do some things
[17:34.390 --> 17:35.690]  because I'm a smart dude,
[17:35.690 --> 17:37.290]  but honestly, I'm gonna miss some shit.
[17:37.290 --> 17:38.830]  We're all going to miss a few things
[17:38.830 --> 17:40.910]  and a little bit of guidance should be appreciated.
[17:40.910 --> 17:42.710]  A little bit of education should be appreciated.
[17:42.710 --> 17:44.190]  So I was grateful that this dude
[17:44.190 --> 17:45.270]  pointed a couple of things out.
[17:45.270 --> 17:46.990]  There was no violation or anything,
[17:46.990 --> 17:48.270]  but he's like, did you ever think of this?
[17:48.270 --> 17:49.590]  Did you ever think of this?
[17:49.590 --> 17:50.830]  And he just gave us a few ideas
[17:50.830 --> 17:52.910]  on ways we could improve safety.
[17:52.910 --> 17:55.070]  There was really no reason for me to be nervous
[17:55.070 --> 17:58.310]  or intimidated by a Department of Agriculture inspection.
[17:58.310 --> 17:59.230]  The guy was really cool.
[17:59.230 --> 18:00.670]  He was very knowledgeable
[18:00.670 --> 18:02.790]  and he did not want to write anybody up for anything.
[18:02.790 --> 18:04.830]  He wanted to make sure we were doing things correctly.
[18:04.830 --> 18:07.350]  He wanted to leave us a list of things we could improve.
[18:07.350 --> 18:08.950]  And then as we were talking,
[18:08.950 --> 18:10.430]  the dude was just very knowledgeable
[18:10.430 --> 18:13.270]  and he seemed to know a lot about pesticide application.
[18:13.270 --> 18:15.030]  He knew a lot about agriculture.
[18:15.030 --> 18:16.330]  He was just a very knowledgeable guy.
[18:16.330 --> 18:19.230]  So as we spoke, he taught me a lot of great things.
[18:19.230 --> 18:20.910]  He taught me a lot about respirators,
[18:20.910 --> 18:22.130]  a lot about respirator use,
[18:22.130 --> 18:25.150]  because we're required to have respirator training.
[18:25.150 --> 18:26.150]  And I was unaware of that.
[18:26.150 --> 18:28.030]  It's not in some of the paperwork that I've got,
[18:28.030 --> 18:29.710]  but it's in the updated paperwork.
[18:29.710 --> 18:31.550]  And he was like, hey, that's new shit.
[18:31.550 --> 18:33.430]  You have this many days to get that taken care of.
[18:33.430 --> 18:36.170]  So he'll be back in 60 to 90 days to check on me.
[18:36.170 --> 18:37.170]  And to tell you the truth,
[18:37.170 --> 18:39.650]  we've already scheduled all of the respirator training.
[18:39.650 --> 18:41.630]  Everything will have been handled very soon.
[18:41.630 --> 18:43.210]  You guys, if you're using a respirator,
[18:43.210 --> 18:45.090]  make sure you're using the right cartridges
[18:45.090 --> 18:47.690]  on the respirator, and maybe even go to a doctor
[18:47.690 --> 18:50.590]  and make sure your lungs are properly equipped
[18:50.590 --> 18:51.730]  to wear that respirator.
[18:51.730 --> 18:53.170]  And then maybe even get a fit test
[18:53.170 --> 18:55.430]  and make sure you're wearing the respirator correctly.
[18:55.430 --> 18:57.730]  Because there are, if you're not wearing it properly,
[18:58.430 --> 18:59.270]  there are leaks and you're just breathing
[18:59.270 --> 19:01.230]  in the pesticide anyway.
[19:01.230 --> 19:04.230]  And you make little air holes that actually bring in more
[19:04.230 --> 19:06.070]  than you would if you just opened it freely,
[19:06.070 --> 19:07.510]  because you create a little suction.
[19:07.510 --> 19:10.270]  Anyway, the Department of Agriculture was great.
[19:10.270 --> 19:11.630]  I had no reason to be intimidated.
[19:11.630 --> 19:12.930]  And if you have a facility,
[19:12.930 --> 19:16.190]  I recommend that you call and volunteer
[19:16.190 --> 19:17.850]  for a voluntary compliance check.
[19:17.850 --> 19:19.070]  I learned a lot of things.
[19:19.070 --> 19:20.870]  And that way, if you are screwing up,
[19:20.870 --> 19:22.230]  they'll come tell you, hey, you're screwing up.
[19:22.230 --> 19:23.870]  They don't show up surprisingly and be like,
[19:23.870 --> 19:24.710]  hey, look, you fucked up.
[19:24.710 --> 19:26.130]  You got this and this together.
[19:26.130 --> 19:27.990]  Basically, you have to keep your pesticides away
[19:27.990 --> 19:29.910]  from all your nutrients.
[19:29.910 --> 19:31.710]  And you have to have all your equipment accessible.
[19:31.710 --> 19:34.150]  You have to have your safety equipment accessible.
[19:34.150 --> 19:36.070]  And you have to have all of your paperwork,
[19:36.070 --> 19:38.270]  your spray logs, your MSDS sheets,
[19:38.270 --> 19:40.550]  and all of your Department of Agriculture posters,
[19:40.550 --> 19:42.990]  that racist poster, you have to have that accessible.
[19:42.990 --> 19:44.830]  And also you need eyewash stations.
[19:44.830 --> 19:47.110]  And they're going to ask you a lot of questions
[19:47.110 --> 19:50.190]  about what happens if your worker sprays pesticides
[19:50.190 --> 19:51.030]  in his eyes.
[19:51.030 --> 19:51.850]  What are you going to do?
[19:51.850 --> 19:52.990]  How's this gonna happen?
[19:52.990 --> 19:54.510]  Who's going to drive him to the hospital?
[19:54.510 --> 19:55.470]  Where is the hospital?
[19:55.490 --> 19:57.330]  Who does he notify if something happens?
[19:57.330 --> 19:59.570]  Be prepared for those types of questions.
[19:59.570 --> 20:02.050]  Fortunately, I'm a smart dude and we're kind of prepared
[20:02.050 --> 20:03.730]  and I have a great compliance officer.
[20:03.730 --> 20:05.890]  So I answered all of those questions correctly.
[20:05.890 --> 20:08.030]  Then they pull aside all of the growers,
[20:08.030 --> 20:10.610]  anybody that applies pesticides or any sort of sprays
[20:10.610 --> 20:13.450]  using the pesticide application device.
[20:13.450 --> 20:15.570]  They ask them a lot of questions also.
[20:15.570 --> 20:18.370]  Then they also inspected all of the pesticide applicators.
[20:18.370 --> 20:19.290]  We've got a paint sprayer
[20:19.290 --> 20:21.250]  and then we've got some smaller things that we use.
[20:21.250 --> 20:22.350]  They inspected all of those.
[20:22.350 --> 20:24.570]  They ask us how we clean them, how often we clean them.
[20:24.590 --> 20:25.630]  There were a lot of questions.
[20:25.630 --> 20:27.670]  Basically, make sure you're doing shit right
[20:27.670 --> 20:28.630]  and everything will be okay.
[20:28.630 --> 20:33.190]  But if you don't schedule the voluntary inspection,
[20:33.190 --> 20:34.390]  they can just show up and inspect.
[20:34.390 --> 20:36.530]  And then if you fuck up, they can fine you.
[20:36.530 --> 20:37.450]  They can do whatever they want.
[20:37.450 --> 20:39.110]  But basically, they're making sure you're not causing
[20:39.110 --> 20:41.790]  any immediate threat to human health or safety
[20:41.790 --> 20:42.850]  is what their main goal.
[20:42.850 --> 20:43.830]  So shout out to my new friend
[20:43.830 --> 20:45.390]  at the Department of Agriculture.
[20:45.390 --> 20:47.110]  It was great learning a lot from you.
[20:47.110 --> 20:49.470]  I doubt you listen to the podcast, but if you do,
[20:49.470 --> 20:50.310]  big thumbs up.
[20:50.310 --> 20:51.790]  I had a great day with you.
[20:51.790 --> 20:53.070]  All right, you guys, I need to press pause.
[20:53.090 --> 20:54.690]  I'm talking really fast.
[20:54.690 --> 20:56.050]  So you know what, let's not even press pause.
[20:56.050 --> 20:57.670]  Let's just take a dab together.
[20:57.670 --> 20:59.850]  And then we're gonna get into some emails.
[20:59.850 --> 21:01.050]  I hope that this works out
[21:01.050 --> 21:02.650]  because I gotta get my shit in a pile.
[21:02.650 --> 21:03.810]  I got this email right here.
[21:03.810 --> 21:06.250]  I'm trying to set myself up for success, y'all.
[21:07.130 --> 21:08.490]  Let's dab some of this.
[21:08.490 --> 21:09.310]  What do we wanna get into?
[21:09.310 --> 21:10.290]  Let's get into some Clementine.
[21:10.290 --> 21:11.130]  It's not real heavy.
[21:11.130 --> 21:11.950]  It doesn't fuck me up too bad.
[21:11.950 --> 21:13.570]  It makes me functional.
[21:13.570 --> 21:15.010]  Let's dab out of the one I've already opened.
[21:15.010 --> 21:17.210]  That's a freshie right there.
[21:17.210 --> 21:19.810]  Got the Clementine.
[21:19.810 --> 21:20.630]  There we go.
[21:20.630 --> 21:21.810]  That's one I've been dipping into.
[21:21.810 --> 21:22.650]  It gets me nice and high.
[21:23.170 --> 21:24.010]  It gives me a good buzz,
[21:24.010 --> 21:24.830]  but it doesn't fuck me up to where I can't function
[21:24.830 --> 21:27.310]  and can't think about a podcast where I get all weird.
[21:27.310 --> 21:28.790]  Sometimes I get quiet when I take dabs.
[21:28.790 --> 21:30.110]  Sometimes I ramble when I take dabs.
[21:30.110 --> 21:32.030]  It kinda depends on when I'm smoking.
[21:32.030 --> 21:33.550]  Apparently right now I'm rambling.
[21:33.550 --> 21:34.590]  So we're getting a dab together.
[21:34.590 --> 21:37.270]  I got a decent sized dab of some Clementine batter
[21:37.270 --> 21:39.870]  on my pencil dabber here.
[21:39.870 --> 21:43.750]  I've got my Hitman Hammerhead sidecar
[21:43.750 --> 21:45.230]  with the yellow label on it.
[21:45.230 --> 21:46.670]  I like the Hammerhead perk on the inside.
[21:46.670 --> 21:47.550]  Honestly, that's why I use it.
[21:47.550 --> 21:48.750]  It makes the, it just hits well.
[21:48.750 --> 21:50.590]  And I like the flared out mouthpiece.
[21:50.610 --> 21:52.990]  A lot of people are haters on Hitman Glass,
[21:52.990 --> 21:54.970]  but it hits well, so I don't even care.
[21:54.970 --> 21:56.490]  It hits, man.
[21:56.490 --> 21:57.550]  And then of course I have got
[21:57.550 --> 22:00.530]  the dual layered thermal banger here.
[22:00.530 --> 22:01.550]  I'm heating the shit out of that.
[22:01.550 --> 22:04.130]  And I've also got my bubble cap within reach.
[22:04.130 --> 22:05.810]  So you guys, if you were at home,
[22:05.810 --> 22:06.650]  if you were wherever you are,
[22:06.650 --> 22:09.130]  if you're at a place where you could take a dab,
[22:09.130 --> 22:10.290]  take a fat dab with me.
[22:10.290 --> 22:13.250]  And then if your mom's around, certainly give her a hug.
[22:13.250 --> 22:14.090]  All right, I'm heating this up.
[22:14.090 --> 22:15.050]  It's gonna take a couple of seconds
[22:15.050 --> 22:16.930]  because it's a thermal banger.
[22:16.930 --> 22:18.650]  I'm gonna try to go kind of low temp on this dab,
[22:18.650 --> 22:19.730]  not take too long.
[22:20.610 --> 22:22.690]  Thanks for joining me for a dab, you guys.
[22:22.690 --> 22:23.730]  Tweet me, send me a tweet.
[22:23.730 --> 22:25.050]  Let me know what you're dabbing
[22:25.050 --> 22:27.330]  while you're dabbing with me.
[22:27.330 --> 22:29.210]  All right, that's plenty hot.
[22:29.210 --> 22:31.690]  I got my coil condenser decorated torch here.
[22:31.690 --> 22:33.090]  Shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass
[22:33.090 --> 22:34.290]  for keeping me laced up.
[22:35.250 --> 22:37.370]  This torch was a gift from the beautiful Miss Jenny B.
[22:37.370 --> 22:38.730]  So shout out for the gift.
[22:39.770 --> 22:40.890]  All right, I'm letting this nail cool.
[22:40.890 --> 22:42.690]  That's the thing about a dab or a banger.
[22:42.690 --> 22:43.530]  You gotta heat it up,
[22:43.530 --> 22:46.530]  then you gotta let it cool and get it just right.
[22:46.530 --> 22:47.370]  It's getting there.
[22:47.370 --> 22:49.970]  And I just gotta talk my way through it.
[22:49.990 --> 22:50.810]  I gotta let it get cool
[22:50.810 --> 22:52.610]  because if I hit it too hot, it'll make me cough.
[22:52.610 --> 22:53.450]  So here we go.
[22:53.450 --> 22:54.270]  I think this is just about right.
[22:54.270 --> 22:55.110]  Here we go.
[22:55.110 --> 22:55.930]  Take a dab with me, you guys.
[22:55.930 --> 22:57.570]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[23:04.080 --> 23:05.480]  I might've let it cool just a little too much,
[23:05.480 --> 23:07.120]  but it tastes so good.
[23:07.120 --> 23:08.160]  Put the cap on.
[23:13.210 --> 23:14.110]  That's a good dab.
[23:19.400 --> 23:22.200]  Yup, that thermal banger and the bubble cap.
[23:22.200 --> 23:23.880]  That makes everything.
[23:23.880 --> 23:24.720]  All right.
[23:24.720 --> 23:26.960]  I got hash oil all over the email paper here.
[23:27.880 --> 23:29.400]  I got hash oil on my finger.
[23:29.400 --> 23:31.280]  I'm gonna go ahead and get back to work.
[23:31.280 --> 23:32.640]  All right, let's get back into a podcast,
[23:32.640 --> 23:33.460]  ladies and gentlemen.
[23:33.460 --> 23:34.300]  Thank you for joining me.
[23:34.300 --> 23:35.380]  Thanks for tolerating a dab with me.
[23:35.380 --> 23:36.840]  I hope you took a fat dab of something.
[23:36.840 --> 23:37.920]  I hope you're talking funny too.
[23:37.920 --> 23:39.380]  I hope your head is vibrating.
[23:40.480 --> 23:42.100]  Let's get into some emails.
[23:43.320 --> 23:44.160]  I feel like I'm gonna cough,
[23:44.160 --> 23:47.160]  but I'm not gonna let myself because I'm a Jedi.
[23:47.160 --> 23:49.120]  This email comes from one of my favorite emailers,
[23:49.120 --> 23:50.040]  one of my favorite listeners.
[23:50.040 --> 23:52.040]  This guy communicates with me quite a bit.
[23:52.040 --> 23:53.480]  This guy is Mr. St. Skinny.
[23:54.500 --> 23:56.120]  This is a long email, but it's wonderful.
[23:56.120 --> 23:59.040]  It goes a lot like this.
[23:59.040 --> 24:00.960]  Hey Jeff, sorry it's taken me so long to respond.
[24:00.960 --> 24:02.320]  I've been having a rough time keeping up
[24:02.320 --> 24:05.680]  with every day lately, but things are settling down for now.
[24:05.680 --> 24:07.840]  We got the call the other day from one of the nurses
[24:07.840 --> 24:09.060]  and they have good news.
[24:09.060 --> 24:12.120]  Mama Saint's new immune system is 100% engrafted.
[24:12.120 --> 24:13.520]  She's doing great.
[24:13.520 --> 24:15.000]  Although going a little crazy
[24:15.000 --> 24:16.880]  being stuck in the house all the time,
[24:16.880 --> 24:19.560]  but overall things are good.
[24:21.600 --> 24:23.160]  There's that cough I said I wasn't gonna do.
[24:23.160 --> 24:24.520]  Sorry, I didn't mean to lie to you.
[24:24.520 --> 24:26.000]  Big shout out to St. Skinny's mom.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.360]  I'm glad you're doing great.
[24:27.360 --> 24:28.240]  You'll be fine in the house.
[24:28.240 --> 24:29.160]  Just take care of yourself.
[24:29.160 --> 24:31.000]  Get well, listen to a lot of podcasts,
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.440]  get yourself some Netflix, you'll be okay.
[24:33.440 --> 24:34.400]  I'm gonna keep going with the email.
[24:34.400 --> 24:36.000]  It goes, I wanna thank you for the shout out
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.320]  and love sent to Mama Saint and myself.
[24:38.320 --> 24:40.240]  We were actually on the way home from the cancer center,
[24:40.240 --> 24:42.080]  which happens to be in the same hospital
[24:42.080 --> 24:44.200]  that we were coming home from when you did the first shout
[24:44.200 --> 24:47.080]  out and it was definitely needed that day.
[24:47.080 --> 24:49.240]  The process has been rough on both of us,
[24:49.240 --> 24:51.240]  but especially Mama Saint.
[24:51.240 --> 24:52.640]  Dude, I'm glad I could give you a shout out
[24:52.640 --> 24:53.480]  at just the right time.
[24:53.480 --> 24:55.040]  It seems like a lot of life happens
[24:55.040 --> 24:57.360]  just as it's supposed to that way.
[24:57.360 --> 24:59.040]  To continue with the email, it says,
[24:59.040 --> 25:02.400]  you asked me about the name St. Skinny and how I got it.
[25:02.400 --> 25:03.760]  Here's the answer, you guys.
[25:03.760 --> 25:05.320]  I've been slender since I started high school
[25:05.320 --> 25:07.280]  and high school was a point that I basically
[25:07.280 --> 25:09.840]  only owned black shirts and black or blue jeans.
[25:09.840 --> 25:11.200]  One day we were playing hacky sack
[25:11.200 --> 25:13.000]  and my buddy Midget decided to give me the name
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.280]  Skinny Black, which I didn't know was a character
[25:15.280 --> 25:16.680]  in Hustle and Flow.
[25:16.680 --> 25:18.120]  I was given the name because he's skinny
[25:18.120 --> 25:19.400]  and I always wore black.
[25:19.400 --> 25:22.280]  And almost immediately it changed to just skinny.
[25:22.280 --> 25:24.320]  A couple years later, I was listening to a song
[25:24.320 --> 25:27.440]  called St. Jimmy and I would replace Jimmy with Skinny
[25:27.440 --> 25:28.920]  whenever it came up in the song.
[25:28.920 --> 25:31.280]  I put St. Skinny as my middle name in Facebook
[25:31.280 --> 25:34.440]  as a joke and it just stuck.
[25:34.440 --> 25:35.680]  I hope all is well with you and yours.
[25:35.680 --> 25:37.080]  Keep doing what you do.
[25:37.080 --> 25:38.760]  You're a great asset to the community
[25:38.760 --> 25:42.520]  and doing a great job breaking the stoner stereotype.
[25:42.520 --> 25:44.160]  St. Skinny, it's good to know more about my friends.
[25:44.160 --> 25:45.680]  I'm glad I know about that.
[25:45.680 --> 25:47.240]  I'm glad I know that about you.
[25:47.240 --> 25:50.160]  Sorry, that dab is fucking my brain up right now.
[25:50.160 --> 25:51.800]  And also, man, thanks for noticing
[25:51.800 --> 25:54.080]  that I have broken the stoner stereotype,
[25:54.840 --> 25:55.680]  which is not accurate right now
[25:55.680 --> 25:57.040]  because I'm high as shit and I can't even talk right.
[25:57.040 --> 26:00.000]  But most of the time I do break that stoner stereotype.
[26:00.000 --> 26:00.840]  I get some shit done.
[26:00.840 --> 26:01.800]  I speak well.
[26:01.800 --> 26:03.160]  Try to be on time for stuff.
[26:03.160 --> 26:04.320]  Thanks for noticing that.
[26:04.320 --> 26:06.800]  And man, thanks for noticing I'm an asset.
[26:06.800 --> 26:08.240]  That's great for you to say.
[26:08.240 --> 26:09.400]  I appreciate that.
[26:09.400 --> 26:10.760]  It makes it all worth the work
[26:10.760 --> 26:12.000]  that I put into this podcast.
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.080]  I try to do a lot.
[26:13.080 --> 26:14.160]  He ends the email with,
[26:14.160 --> 26:16.120]  "'Keep it irey, growers love,' from Saint."
[26:16.120 --> 26:16.960]  Then he goes on and says,
[26:16.960 --> 26:19.160]  "'P.S., whether you knew it or not,
[26:19.160 --> 26:20.920]  "'that episode in which you read my email
[26:20.960 --> 26:24.280]  "'was pretty much a Dude Grows Crew special.
[26:24.280 --> 26:27.120]  "'Three of the emails you read were from people
[26:27.120 --> 26:30.160]  "'that are part of the Dude Grows Crew, including myself.
[26:30.160 --> 26:33.680]  "'Anyway, I'm gonna go do a fat dab at Mama Saint.
[26:33.680 --> 26:35.080]  "'Oh, and hug Mama Saint.
[26:35.080 --> 26:37.280]  "'Take it easy, bro.'"
[26:37.280 --> 26:38.560]  Saint Skinny, that's a great email, man.
[26:38.560 --> 26:40.360]  It's good to hear that Mama's doing well.
[26:40.360 --> 26:41.400]  Too bad she's stuck in the house,
[26:41.400 --> 26:44.520]  but hey, that's fucking awesome that she's doing well.
[26:44.520 --> 26:46.240]  Her immune system will boost back up.
[26:46.240 --> 26:47.600]  She'll be doing good again.
[26:47.600 --> 26:49.240]  And man, thanks for all the info about yourself.
[26:49.240 --> 26:51.160]  I like knowing stuff about my friends.
[26:51.160 --> 26:52.240]  That's pretty rad.
[26:52.240 --> 26:53.360]  Why do they call me Rasta Jeff?
[26:53.360 --> 26:54.720]  I guess would be fair.
[26:54.720 --> 26:56.320]  Because I've got dreadlocks down to my ass,
[26:56.320 --> 26:57.720]  and I listen to reggae, and I'm a Rasta man,
[26:57.720 --> 26:59.320]  and my name's Jeff, so Rasta Jeff
[26:59.320 --> 27:01.560]  was just an easy nickname for me to acquire.
[27:01.560 --> 27:03.880]  A lot of my friends call me Wookie,
[27:03.880 --> 27:05.920]  because I'm 6'5", and I have dreadlocks,
[27:05.920 --> 27:08.200]  and kind of a Chewbacca.
[27:08.200 --> 27:10.120]  I prefer not to wear shoes too often,
[27:10.120 --> 27:12.200]  and sometimes I could use a shower.
[27:12.200 --> 27:13.360]  So that's why they call me Wookie.
[27:13.360 --> 27:16.000]  And then back in the day, my friends used to call me Hippie,
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.960]  because I was just a great big hippie.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.480]  I worked at a place, and one of the old guys
[27:20.480 --> 27:22.320]  asked my best friend, why do you call him Hippie?
[27:22.320 --> 27:23.880]  And my buddy's response was,
[27:23.880 --> 27:25.560]  because it's better than calling him a pussy
[27:25.560 --> 27:26.600]  in front of everybody.
[27:26.600 --> 27:27.800]  And I laughed pretty good at that.
[27:27.800 --> 27:29.680]  So shout out to my buddy Rob the Dude.
[27:29.680 --> 27:31.080]  Rob the Dude, he's a good dude.
[27:31.080 --> 27:33.240]  I miss that guy, one of my best friends.
[27:33.240 --> 27:36.000]  Anyway, Skinny, thanks for the email, dude.
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.200]  I appreciate it.
[27:37.200 --> 27:38.320]  If you ever have any more questions
[27:38.320 --> 27:41.200]  or anything else to say, I hope you contact me.
[27:41.200 --> 27:42.200]  Let's see, what else did I miss?
[27:42.200 --> 27:43.040]  Anything in here?
[27:43.040 --> 27:43.880]  The Dude Grows Cup.
[27:43.880 --> 27:45.440]  Man, shout out to all my friends at the Dude Grows Cup.
[27:45.480 --> 27:48.960]  If you don't know what the Dude Grows crew is,
[27:48.960 --> 27:50.960]  Dude Grows is another podcast about cannabis.
[27:50.960 --> 27:52.520]  It's a different style than my show.
[27:52.520 --> 27:53.960]  Scotty Real and the Dude sit around
[27:53.960 --> 27:56.560]  and talk about recharge all day.
[27:56.560 --> 27:57.400]  So give them a listen.
[27:57.400 --> 27:58.560]  You guys might enjoy the podcast.
[27:58.560 --> 27:59.400]  I listen when I can.
[27:59.400 --> 28:00.560]  I can't listen constantly.
[28:00.560 --> 28:01.760]  I listen to so many podcasts,
[28:01.760 --> 28:03.720]  but I do listen to the Dude Grows Show.
[28:03.720 --> 28:06.480]  And I definitely will be at the Dude Grows Cup.
[28:06.480 --> 28:08.720]  If they throw another event, I will go.
[28:08.720 --> 28:11.000]  I may even compete, because last time,
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.480]  one of my strains won second place,
[28:12.480 --> 28:13.840]  and I didn't even grow it.
[28:13.840 --> 28:14.800]  It was at second or third.
[28:14.800 --> 28:17.040]  It was a tie for, it became, I don't remember.
[28:17.040 --> 28:18.080]  It was either second or third place,
[28:18.080 --> 28:21.080]  but one of my strains, Lemon Jeffrey, won an award,
[28:21.080 --> 28:21.920]  and I didn't even grow it.
[28:21.920 --> 28:23.880]  So I imagine that if I grew it and I entered it,
[28:23.880 --> 28:24.960]  it would fucking win, right?
[28:24.960 --> 28:26.000]  That just makes sense.
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.920]  All right, Skinny, thanks for the messages, dude.
[28:27.920 --> 28:28.760]  I hope mom is well.
[28:28.760 --> 28:30.040]  I hope you are well.
[28:30.040 --> 28:33.000]  Take a fat dab right now and give Mama Saint,
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.960]  or Mama Skinny, a hug for me.
[28:35.960 --> 28:37.480]  Make sure she hears this, dude.
[28:37.480 --> 28:38.440]  Make sure she hears this.
[28:38.440 --> 28:39.720]  Hope you're doing well, Mama.
[28:39.720 --> 28:41.480]  All right, we got another email.
[28:42.560 --> 28:44.320]  This one starts off and specifically says,
[28:44.360 --> 28:45.840]  please don't use my name.
[28:45.840 --> 28:47.440]  You can call me Parliament.
[28:47.440 --> 28:48.680]  Thanks, and with that being said,
[28:48.680 --> 28:51.280]  let's get down to the brass tacks, man.
[28:51.280 --> 28:54.400]  If I'm not mistaken, biochar is carbon-based material
[28:54.400 --> 28:56.080]  that is burned without air.
[28:56.080 --> 28:58.440]  I was looking at the wood chips, the wood,
[28:58.440 --> 29:00.640]  oh, and wood pellets from my electric smoker,
[29:00.640 --> 29:03.120]  and noticed that they were burned, but not ash.
[29:03.120 --> 29:04.600]  Is that biochar?
[29:04.600 --> 29:07.400]  Is it good to use as an amendment to cocoa?
[29:07.400 --> 29:08.800]  Can it be used in a tea?
[29:08.800 --> 29:11.480]  I would imagine that it would be great for compost.
[29:11.480 --> 29:13.720]  I know that wood ash contains a lot of potassium,
[29:13.760 --> 29:16.560]  but goodies can be gained from this by-product,
[29:16.560 --> 29:18.880]  or but can goodies be gained from this by-product
[29:18.880 --> 29:20.480]  of carnivorous indulgence?
[29:20.480 --> 29:22.880]  Business out of the way, onto the pleasantries.
[29:22.880 --> 29:25.440]  I would like to say that I was made aware of your podcast
[29:25.440 --> 29:26.840]  from the Dude Gross Show.
[29:26.840 --> 29:28.720]  Your show has become one of my favorite podcasts,
[29:28.720 --> 29:30.360]  and I never miss an episode.
[29:30.360 --> 29:32.000]  I love the Throwback Thursday episodes,
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.800]  and the fact that they are super long.
[29:33.800 --> 29:35.640]  Don't be afraid to put out long episodes,
[29:35.640 --> 29:37.320]  like two or three hours.
[29:37.320 --> 29:39.200]  Fans will listen.
[29:39.200 --> 29:40.760]  Then again, what the fuck do I know?
[29:40.760 --> 29:42.080]  Dude, it sounds like you know a lot so far.
[29:42.080 --> 29:42.920]  I'm happy with this email.
[29:42.920 --> 29:44.360]  You've asked a great question,
[29:44.360 --> 29:45.760]  so you've sparked some thought in my mind
[29:45.760 --> 29:47.600]  and other people's minds.
[29:47.600 --> 29:49.320]  You've given me a compliment,
[29:49.320 --> 29:50.920]  and you've mentioned the Dude Gross Show
[29:50.920 --> 29:52.520]  and told me where you came from.
[29:52.520 --> 29:53.360]  I'm in.
[29:53.360 --> 29:55.040]  So far, it sounds like you know a fucking lot.
[29:55.040 --> 29:57.960]  I agree with everything you've said so far.
[29:57.960 --> 30:00.320]  We're gonna talk about the biochar part
[30:00.320 --> 30:01.360]  here in just a minute.
[30:01.360 --> 30:02.280]  And dude, thanks for mentioning
[30:02.280 --> 30:03.320]  the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[30:03.320 --> 30:04.420]  I'll keep putting those out.
[30:04.420 --> 30:05.720]  I'm gonna get caught up eventually,
[30:05.720 --> 30:06.560]  and that's gonna be weird.
[30:06.560 --> 30:08.480]  Then what the hell am I gonna do on Thursdays?
[30:08.480 --> 30:10.020]  But I'm gonna keep going with the email.
[30:10.020 --> 30:11.120]  He says, thanks for the knowledge.
[30:11.120 --> 30:12.980]  Thanks for the consistency with your episodes.
[30:12.980 --> 30:15.760]  Dude, that is the most challenging part, the consistency.
[30:15.760 --> 30:17.840]  I promise to put out an episode every Monday,
[30:17.840 --> 30:19.240]  and I've been trying to do every Thursday,
[30:19.240 --> 30:21.500]  and I haven't missed one for like six months now.
[30:21.500 --> 30:23.220]  I've never missed a Monday show.
[30:23.220 --> 30:25.280]  So you're welcome for the consistency.
[30:25.280 --> 30:27.680]  That's the challenge of a podcaster.
[30:27.680 --> 30:29.640]  He goes on, and he says, I really look forward to them.
[30:29.640 --> 30:31.280]  Thanks for being cool as fuck,
[30:31.280 --> 30:33.600]  and since I know you're already gonna take a fat dab,
[30:33.600 --> 30:35.740]  go ahead and give your mom a hug for me.
[30:35.740 --> 30:36.880]  I will do that.
[30:36.880 --> 30:38.640]  And then I like the ending to this email.
[30:38.640 --> 30:40.320]  He says, in the words of Joey Diaz,
[30:40.320 --> 30:42.080]  stay black, cocksucker.
[30:42.080 --> 30:44.640]  Man, that's the best fucking ending to an email ever.
[30:44.640 --> 30:47.000]  Sincerely, and then he says his name,
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.160]  and then he ends it with, I'm just gonna say Parliament,
[30:50.160 --> 30:51.280]  because that's what he said to call him.
[30:51.280 --> 30:53.760]  So Parliament, thanks for the email, bro.
[30:53.760 --> 30:56.120]  I love the good question, because Biochar,
[30:56.120 --> 30:57.800]  I never thought too much about Biochar.
[30:57.800 --> 31:01.040]  I've heard of them using Biochar a lot at the worm factory,
[31:01.040 --> 31:02.620]  but I have not thought about too much of it
[31:02.620 --> 31:03.680]  as an Okoko amendment
[31:03.680 --> 31:05.480]  until you sparked that thought in my head.
[31:05.480 --> 31:08.880]  So let's talk about Biochar for just a second.
[31:08.880 --> 31:10.760]  One thing that you said is that Biochar's,
[31:10.760 --> 31:13.080]  one of the main things was that it was made without oxygen,
[31:13.080 --> 31:15.280]  and you were doing that, it sounds like.
[31:15.280 --> 31:17.120]  But how are you removing the oxygen?
[31:17.120 --> 31:18.120]  Is there a vacuum there?
[31:18.120 --> 31:19.360]  Is there an absence of oxygen?
[31:19.360 --> 31:21.480]  Or is there just free-flowing oxygen?
[31:21.480 --> 31:23.540]  Is there passive oxygen?
[31:23.540 --> 31:25.180]  I'm not doubting you or your idea
[31:25.180 --> 31:26.140]  that there is an oxygen there.
[31:26.140 --> 31:28.800]  I'm just wondering, is there oxygen flowing through there?
[31:28.800 --> 31:30.160]  Is there some oxygen?
[31:30.160 --> 31:33.340]  But anyway, also, one of the things that identifies it
[31:33.340 --> 31:35.960]  as Biochar is the specific temperature.
[31:35.960 --> 31:38.180]  It says temperatures of four to 500 degrees
[31:38.180 --> 31:39.020]  produce more char,
[31:39.020 --> 31:41.260]  while temperatures above 700
[31:41.260 --> 31:43.740]  favor the yield of liquid and gas components.
[31:43.740 --> 31:45.940]  So you'll be pulling out more liquids and gases
[31:45.940 --> 31:47.140]  at higher temperatures.
[31:47.140 --> 31:49.820]  So it kind of depends on what temperature
[31:49.820 --> 31:51.660]  you're getting it to and how much char is happening.
[31:51.660 --> 31:53.820]  And also, Biochar is really fine.
[31:53.820 --> 31:56.620]  So if you're gonna make the Biochar out of that stuff,
[31:56.620 --> 31:58.660]  I would almost start the char once
[31:58.660 --> 32:02.180]  and then shred it up real fine or break it up even smaller,
[32:02.180 --> 32:04.940]  make the pellets even smaller, and then rechar them,
[32:04.940 --> 32:06.160]  maybe if you can crush them up
[32:06.160 --> 32:07.720]  or break them in half or something,
[32:08.240 --> 32:09.520]  because the Biochar, the smaller it is,
[32:09.520 --> 32:11.640]  the more surface can get charred.
[32:11.640 --> 32:13.840]  So you have more surface area that is burned
[32:13.840 --> 32:15.080]  and it's got the carbon available.
[32:15.080 --> 32:16.200]  You're making the carbon available.
[32:16.200 --> 32:17.520]  It's that dusty part,
[32:17.520 --> 32:19.060]  the part that kind of sticks to your fingers
[32:19.060 --> 32:20.160]  and makes your fingers all black
[32:20.160 --> 32:22.080]  and you end up looking like a coal miner.
[32:22.080 --> 32:24.400]  That's the part that you're kind of looking for, I think.
[32:24.400 --> 32:26.720]  And you wanna make as much surface area as you can
[32:26.720 --> 32:28.000]  to char as much as you can.
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.640]  And then it will work better as an amendment
[32:30.640 --> 32:32.760]  if it is smaller and more available.
[32:32.760 --> 32:34.840]  One thing I think about the Biochar
[32:34.840 --> 32:37.400]  is they feed it to worms and the worms pass it
[32:38.080 --> 32:39.640]  and it makes it smaller and more bioavailable
[32:39.640 --> 32:41.240]  and the worms also love it.
[32:41.240 --> 32:44.360]  So I think make it smaller, burn it again,
[32:44.360 --> 32:45.960]  and then feed it to earthworms,
[32:45.960 --> 32:47.800]  red wigglers and stuff like that.
[32:47.800 --> 32:49.720]  And then I think you're basically making Biochar,
[32:49.720 --> 32:50.680]  but you're close already.
[32:50.680 --> 32:52.420]  I think you're mostly correct.
[32:52.420 --> 32:54.800]  And I'm just getting my information from the internet
[32:54.800 --> 32:56.400]  and you're really close.
[32:56.400 --> 32:58.760]  You are making low budget Biochar.
[32:58.760 --> 32:59.840]  You're off to a good start,
[32:59.840 --> 33:00.880]  but there are a couple more things
[33:00.880 --> 33:03.080]  that sounds like you could probably do.
[33:03.080 --> 33:05.000]  Good, I hope that answered your question.
[33:05.000 --> 33:07.000]  My advice would be, like I said,
[33:07.000 --> 33:08.680]  char it, crush it again, char it again
[33:08.680 --> 33:09.800]  to where all of it is charred.
[33:09.800 --> 33:11.280]  Make sure that every, and I'm not,
[33:11.280 --> 33:12.720]  I haven't used your pellet stove,
[33:12.720 --> 33:14.360]  so I don't know how burned it's getting
[33:14.360 --> 33:16.680]  on the inside or on the outside of the pellets,
[33:16.680 --> 33:17.720]  but make sure it's all charred.
[33:17.720 --> 33:20.120]  Make sure it's really fine and then use some of it.
[33:20.120 --> 33:22.320]  And then maybe if you have the availability,
[33:22.320 --> 33:24.600]  feed some of that to some red wiggler worms
[33:24.600 --> 33:25.760]  and then use that.
[33:25.760 --> 33:27.000]  And then see if you see a difference
[33:27.000 --> 33:29.120]  in the one, the plant without the Biochar,
[33:29.120 --> 33:30.720]  the plant with the homemade Biochar,
[33:30.720 --> 33:32.860]  and then the plant with the Biochar fed to worms.
[33:32.860 --> 33:34.800]  And if you see differences, take notes.
[33:35.800 --> 33:37.160]  That's the way that you really would know
[33:37.160 --> 33:39.080]  if you did it correctly and if it's Biochar.
[33:39.080 --> 33:40.600]  It sounds very similar.
[33:40.600 --> 33:42.120]  It really does sound like you're close.
[33:42.120 --> 33:43.640]  And it's probably going to do the same thing.
[33:43.640 --> 33:44.920]  It's going to add that carbon to it
[33:44.920 --> 33:46.640]  and it's gonna help, it's gonna help.
[33:46.640 --> 33:48.880]  So I think you're onto the right track.
[33:48.880 --> 33:50.960]  Dude, thanks for the email.
[33:50.960 --> 33:51.960]  Thanks for the compliment about the
[33:51.960 --> 33:53.120]  Throwback Thursday episodes.
[33:53.120 --> 33:54.920]  And thanks for the Joey Diaz quote.
[33:54.920 --> 33:55.740]  That means a lot to me.
[33:55.740 --> 33:59.020]  That lets me know that you really have learned who I am.
[33:59.020 --> 34:00.080]  So thanks for the email, bro.
[34:00.080 --> 34:01.280]  Hey, if anybody else out there would like
[34:01.280 --> 34:02.920]  to send me an email, it's growfromyourheart
[34:02.920 --> 34:03.840]  at hotmail.com.
[34:03.840 --> 34:05.760]  I would love to answer your questions on the show.
[34:05.760 --> 34:08.400]  I love answering listener generated content.
[34:08.400 --> 34:10.040]  It lets me know that I'm hitting my target.
[34:10.040 --> 34:11.580]  It lets me know that I'm getting to my audience
[34:11.580 --> 34:12.840]  in a way that's helping.
[34:12.840 --> 34:14.000]  I appreciate it.
[34:14.000 --> 34:14.840]  I would love to hear from you.
[34:14.840 --> 34:16.600]  Also, I would love it if you stalked me
[34:16.600 --> 34:17.760]  on all of the social media.
[34:17.760 --> 34:19.080]  You can find me on Facebook.
[34:19.080 --> 34:20.620]  It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[34:20.620 --> 34:23.040]  You can find me on Twitter at GFYH podcast.
[34:23.040 --> 34:25.800]  And of course, you can send me an email.
[34:25.800 --> 34:28.560]  It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[34:28.560 --> 34:30.440]  Also, if you're into Instagram,
[34:30.440 --> 34:31.560]  you can find me on Instagram.
[34:31.560 --> 34:33.240]  It's irie underscore genetics.
[34:33.680 --> 34:36.320]  I just hit 14,000 followers on Instagram.
[34:36.320 --> 34:38.800]  I just posted a post that got over 1,000 likes.
[34:38.800 --> 34:40.680]  I've never hit 1,000 likes before.
[34:40.680 --> 34:43.160]  So I'm at 14,000 followers,
[34:43.160 --> 34:45.700]  and I posted a 1,000 like photo.
[34:45.700 --> 34:46.720]  So you might wanna check me out.
[34:46.720 --> 34:49.900]  Irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[34:49.900 --> 34:50.940]  That is my seed company.
[34:50.940 --> 34:52.040]  That's my breeding project.
[34:52.040 --> 34:53.880]  I post a lot of photos from the commercial grow.
[34:53.880 --> 34:56.040]  I post a lot of pictures from my breeding stuff.
[34:56.040 --> 34:58.760]  I post a lot of personal pictures from my personal grows.
[34:58.760 --> 35:00.320]  I think you might enjoy it.
[35:00.320 --> 35:01.640]  Also, don't forget about Patreon.
[35:01.640 --> 35:04.840]  Patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[35:04.840 --> 35:07.640]  Also, I've been posting videos to YouTube.
[35:07.640 --> 35:08.560]  By the time you hear this,
[35:08.560 --> 35:12.320]  I think about 70 to 75 videos will be posted to YouTube.
[35:12.320 --> 35:14.040]  If you don't wanna listen to the long episodes
[35:14.040 --> 35:15.320]  or if you're not able to listen to those,
[35:15.320 --> 35:16.480]  you can go to YouTube,
[35:16.480 --> 35:18.360]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[35:18.360 --> 35:21.640]  The first 20 episodes are on the old iGrow Culture feed.
[35:21.640 --> 35:22.840]  If you don't know about iGrow Culture,
[35:22.840 --> 35:25.120]  the show was originally called iGrow Culture.
[35:25.120 --> 35:26.320]  I was kind of forced to change it.
[35:26.320 --> 35:28.720]  That was already somebody else's business name.
[35:28.720 --> 35:29.760]  They work with colleges,
[35:29.760 --> 35:32.520]  and they make college-level horticultural materials.
[35:32.520 --> 35:33.880]  I didn't wanna step on anybody's name,
[35:33.880 --> 35:36.000]  so I changed my name to the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[35:36.000 --> 35:37.280]  which is much more appropriate
[35:37.280 --> 35:38.240]  because I grow from my heart.
[35:38.240 --> 35:39.920]  I want you to grow from your heart.
[35:39.920 --> 35:41.640]  So all of this stuff is on YouTube.
[35:41.640 --> 35:42.640]  Episode one through 20
[35:42.640 --> 35:44.600]  is on the iGrow Culture YouTube channel.
[35:44.600 --> 35:48.760]  21 through 70 to 75 by now is available
[35:48.760 --> 35:51.040]  on the Grow From Your Heart podcast YouTube channel.
[35:51.040 --> 35:52.080]  I've got more videos made.
[35:52.080 --> 35:53.240]  I've just gotta post them.
[35:53.240 --> 35:54.560]  I've gotta get them up there.
[35:54.560 --> 35:55.400]  They are coming.
[35:55.400 --> 35:56.640]  I will get all of them up there.
[35:56.640 --> 35:58.920]  So far, I'm recording episode 231.
[35:58.920 --> 36:01.760]  I plan to get 231 videos up onto the YouTube channel.
[36:01.760 --> 36:04.440]  They will all be there for everyone to watch and enjoy.
[36:04.440 --> 36:06.160]  Basically, it's just a picture of myself
[36:06.160 --> 36:07.560]  scrolling across the screen the whole time,
[36:07.560 --> 36:09.880]  but it's for people that can't listen through YouTube
[36:09.880 --> 36:11.080]  or through iTunes or Stitcher
[36:11.080 --> 36:13.040]  or however else you listen to a podcast.
[36:13.040 --> 36:16.240]  It's just another option for people to check out the show.
[36:16.240 --> 36:18.720]  All right, I've been rambling for about 36 minutes.
[36:18.720 --> 36:20.280]  You guys, I'm going to wrap up the podcast.
[36:20.280 --> 36:22.440]  My throat's doing that thing where it starts cutting out.
[36:22.440 --> 36:24.800]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friend, Bo Nellis.
[36:24.800 --> 36:26.360]  She was in a conversation with a doctor
[36:26.360 --> 36:27.960]  who said that strains don't matter
[36:27.960 --> 36:29.200]  when it came to medical cannabis.
[36:29.200 --> 36:32.560]  And she definitely did her job of standing up
[36:32.560 --> 36:35.520]  for specific strains and strain names.
[36:35.520 --> 36:37.720]  And she stood up for breeders and she made me proud.
[36:37.720 --> 36:39.320]  And she actually mentioned me.
[36:39.320 --> 36:40.400]  So I owe you a big shout out.
[36:40.400 --> 36:41.940]  Thanks for standing up for the breeders,
[36:41.940 --> 36:44.040]  standing up for strains and silly strain names,
[36:44.040 --> 36:46.360]  and specifically for standing up for me
[36:46.360 --> 36:48.080]  and for cannabis in general, Bo.
[36:48.080 --> 36:49.000]  You're a soldier.
[36:49.000 --> 36:49.920]  It's good to have you on the team.
[36:49.920 --> 36:51.320]  So shout out to Bo Nellis.
