[02:12.430 --> 02:15.870]  let's get really high for this episode. And nobody in the room argued that.
[02:15.870 --> 02:19.350]  Everyone was like, I like this idea. Everybody jumped right on that.
[02:19.350 --> 02:20.670]  I got a little roasted. Uh,
[02:20.670 --> 02:22.790]  I noticed that as soon as I hit play on the opening track,
[02:22.810 --> 02:25.350]  I wanted to cop real hard. So getting through that intro was awesome.
[02:25.350 --> 02:29.070]  I was proud of myself. Um, speaking of dabbing, uh,
[02:29.070 --> 02:30.790]  this episode is going to be a lot about dabbing you guys,
[02:30.790 --> 02:33.110]  but coming up in a future episode, it has been confirmed.
[02:33.110 --> 02:37.550]  We're going to have the wonderful, the miss Debbie granny on the podcast.
[02:37.550 --> 02:40.190]  So if you know about the Devin granny, stay tuned for future episodes,
[02:40.190 --> 02:42.230]  she will be joining us. I'm not sure if I'm going to her,
[02:42.270 --> 02:44.310]  if she's coming to me, uh, Lindsay,
[02:44.310 --> 02:48.230]  can you tell us a little bit about your friend, the Devin granny? Um, yeah.
[02:48.230 --> 02:51.910]  So, uh, Gail, um,
[02:52.030 --> 02:56.030]  Oh, drop in the real name, name dropping. Like you're the homie. Now you just,
[02:56.030 --> 02:56.870]  kick it with Gail.
[02:56.870 --> 02:57.710]  Not
[03:01.750 --> 03:04.270]  all right. I guess that's how this is going to go.
[03:04.750 --> 03:08.630]  Anyways, Devin granny. Cause I just feel so whatever.
[03:09.230 --> 03:14.230]  Deb and granny and I, uh, met in Colorado Springs. Um,
[03:14.270 --> 03:17.830]  we actually have hung out at Canada Canyon a couple of times and, uh,
[03:17.870 --> 03:22.430]  gotten to take some dabs and, um, we got to hang out with Brett.
[03:22.430 --> 03:24.710]  Mary's motivation. I actually, um,
[03:25.030 --> 03:28.510]  left work for lunch for 30 minutes and got to go over to Canada Canyon and hang
[03:28.510 --> 03:33.750]  out with her. Um, Brett, uh, THC, Sam THC magazine,
[03:33.750 --> 03:38.710]  Sam, um, and a couple other people Chandler and a couple other people. Yeah.
[03:38.710 --> 03:42.110]  It was super fun. Um, but yeah, uh,
[03:42.150 --> 03:47.150]  she's just big on social media because everybody wants to follow a
[03:47.190 --> 03:48.390]  dabbing granny.
[03:48.550 --> 03:52.190]  So yeah, a shout out to Devin granny. Also, she listens to the podcast.
[03:52.190 --> 03:54.350]  When you told me that she listens to the podcast,
[03:54.350 --> 03:55.870]  it put the biggest smile on my face.
[03:56.150 --> 04:01.150]  So actually you have Brett to thank for that. And, uh, well, I mean,
[04:01.150 --> 04:05.750]  like I was just sitting there, but, um, uh, we were,
[04:06.190 --> 04:10.710]  Brett and I were talking about the podcast at Canada Canyon that day. And,
[04:10.830 --> 04:15.510]  um, granny was like, what podcast is this? And, uh, Brett said,
[04:15.510 --> 04:16.350]  give me your phone.
[04:17.030 --> 04:20.430]  He took the phone from her and he subscribed her to the podcast and he goes,
[04:20.430 --> 04:24.270]  here you go. And so, and so she turns to me and she said, you're on this.
[04:24.270 --> 04:26.070]  And I said, I said, I'm very fortunate.
[04:26.070 --> 04:29.230]  I said Jeff has me on the podcast way more than I should be.
[04:29.230 --> 04:32.230]  I'm fortunate to have you. So it's a mutual, mutual thing.
[04:32.630 --> 04:35.270]  So she started listening to them. And so like,
[04:35.590 --> 04:38.750]  I guess one of the first couple of ones that I don't know what the first couple
[04:38.750 --> 04:40.030]  of ones she listens to actually were,
[04:40.030 --> 04:43.230]  but she listened to the dispensary talk one with the three of us.
[04:43.710 --> 04:46.870]  And she commented on my, uh, something and she was like, Oh,
[04:47.270 --> 04:50.390]  was it me that you were talking about flirting with you in the dispensary?
[04:51.150 --> 04:53.710]  Of course it was. That's what I said. So nobody,
[04:53.790 --> 04:55.630]  a lot of people might know who we're talking about. You guys,
[04:55.630 --> 04:59.190]  check out the dabbing granny on Instagram. She's on Facebook. Uh,
[04:59.550 --> 05:04.190]  when I discovered her, she took a giant dab, like a big dab. You guys,
[05:04.230 --> 05:07.270]  she took like a hundred of my dabs. And when I,
[05:07.270 --> 05:08.550]  the first time I saw the video,
[05:08.550 --> 05:12.190]  I felt so bad about the size of my dad for like the rest of the day.
[05:12.350 --> 05:15.110]  She's a little young to be my granny, but she could be Lindsey's granny.
[05:15.430 --> 05:17.910]  She could definitely be your granny. So she's a granny. She's for sure.
[05:17.910 --> 05:19.430]  We're not being derogatory calling her granny.
[05:20.430 --> 05:24.150]  Her Instagram handle is dabbing underscore granny. I don't think it's,
[05:24.430 --> 05:27.990]  and I'm pretty sure it's the dabbing or you have the dabbing granny on YouTube.
[05:28.190 --> 05:29.750]  There you go. I didn't know about her YouTube.
[05:29.830 --> 05:33.110]  Oh, I think that's where she shouted out your thing.
[05:33.150 --> 05:35.110]  I think so. The shout out, dabbing granny, granny,
[05:35.910 --> 05:37.910]  whatever I'm supposed to call you. Granny. We're just going to go with granny.
[05:37.910 --> 05:38.730]  I like that one.
[05:38.730 --> 05:42.950]  So she takes a giant dab off of a rig and then she chugs a beer,
[05:43.070 --> 05:44.430]  like a whole pint glass.
[05:44.470 --> 05:48.670]  And then she takes a shot and then she blows out her dab and takes another dab
[05:48.690 --> 05:52.150]  from the nectar collector and smiles into the camera. Like that's how you do it,
[05:52.150 --> 05:53.950]  bitches. And then ends the video.
[05:54.750 --> 05:58.510]  So that's actually like one of her staple things.
[05:58.510 --> 06:00.830]  She kind of like changes it around a little bit,
[06:01.230 --> 06:06.110]  but like I'm pretty sure she did that on Facebook live today or some version of
[06:06.110 --> 06:10.830]  that, you know, like a dab, a beer and then like a shot and then something,
[06:10.870 --> 06:14.310]  you know what I mean? Like a bong rip or something. I don't know. But yeah,
[06:14.310 --> 06:16.950]  so I think she does some sort of variation and that's her, like,
[06:16.990 --> 06:21.230]  I think she calls it her party trick. Okay. I, I, I could be wrong.
[06:21.470 --> 06:23.910]  I really could be wrong on that. But yeah, that's,
[06:23.910 --> 06:26.590]  I think that's where she really, it's her version of the strikeout.
[06:27.590 --> 06:31.830]  Yeah. It's impressive is all how the first time I watched the video,
[06:33.070 --> 06:37.310]  it caught my eye because it was someone who could be my grandmother with a dab
[06:37.330 --> 06:40.350]  lined up. That was like, I mean, it was,
[06:40.350 --> 06:43.230]  YouTube dab worthy size. It was massive.
[06:43.510 --> 06:47.150]  I linked to my pink, maybe half a gram,
[06:47.150 --> 06:51.350]  three quarters of a gram. Um, and then she takes this dab like a champ.
[06:51.350 --> 06:53.030]  And as I'm sitting there like, wow,
[06:53.750 --> 06:58.750]  she like throws down a pint and then does a bong rip and then exhales the bong
[06:59.310 --> 07:02.950]  rip and the dab. And I'm looking at this video in my mind,
[07:02.950 --> 07:06.470]  just shocked at what I'm seeing. I was instantly a fan.
[07:06.630 --> 07:09.830]  So I bet a lot of people, her YouTube, her Facebook or Instagram,
[07:09.830 --> 07:12.470]  it's just exploding as people listen to this. You guys go support dabbing.
[07:12.470 --> 07:15.390]  Granny. Uh, granny, we're going to get you on the podcast really soon.
[07:16.110 --> 07:18.270]  Look forward to that in a future episode. You guys, she's a patient,
[07:18.270 --> 07:21.150]  she's a cannabis advocate. She's a smoker, but she's a savage.
[07:21.150 --> 07:24.590]  It's my favorite part about her. She seems to be super sweet from everything.
[07:24.590 --> 07:28.310]  I've seen. All right, granny. Can't wait to have you on the show. Lindsay,
[07:28.310 --> 07:31.270]  thanks for arranging that. That's your fault. You said blame Brett. Brett,
[07:31.290 --> 07:33.670]  thanks for arranging that. That's your fault. You guys got granny.
[07:33.690 --> 07:35.870]  I didn't reach out to her. You guys did that. You got her listening.
[07:35.870 --> 07:37.990]  You brought her here. That's, that's your guys' fault. Thank you.
[07:38.110 --> 07:41.910]  That's what I love about the, the idea of places like Canyon Canyon.
[07:41.910 --> 07:44.950]  It's the community doesn't have any good place to meet up.
[07:44.990 --> 07:48.230]  And as soon as we started getting them really cool connections started being
[07:48.230 --> 07:49.070]  made.
[07:50.830 --> 07:51.790]  Go ahead. You got some to say.
[07:52.870 --> 07:55.230]  I thought you like, I thought you were meaning it in a negative way.
[07:55.230 --> 07:57.430]  And you're like, Lindsay, that's your fault. And I was like, Oh no,
[07:57.430 --> 08:00.550]  no, I was picking on you. And something else. Lindsay said that I really liked,
[08:00.870 --> 08:04.510]  uh, Brett right on for his grabbing someone's phone and subscribing them to my
[08:04.510 --> 08:05.350]  podcast.
[08:06.070 --> 08:08.950]  Just do that shit more frequently. He's going to get my phone and be like,
[08:08.950 --> 08:11.310]  here, you're subscribed to Ross to Jeff's podcast. Now.
[08:11.630 --> 08:16.350]  Have you seen his Instagram lives? Like his snap?
[08:16.390 --> 08:21.030]  What the new Instagram, Snapchat thing? Oh no, no. I have been in tears.
[08:21.310 --> 08:25.390]  The first one he ever put up was like by Snapchat and it was like,
[08:25.670 --> 08:29.830]  he's done. And then the next one was just something like, Oh my God,
[08:29.830 --> 08:33.350]  I'm so excited about this. I can answer all your questions now. Like, yes.
[08:33.390 --> 08:35.830]  And he goes like down and then he comes back up and he's like,
[08:35.870 --> 08:39.670]  I am in my underwear right now. And like, that was it. It just cuts off.
[08:39.670 --> 08:42.950]  And I was just like, yes, these are going to be so amazing.
[08:43.190 --> 08:45.630]  I cannot wait. That dude's a really cool dude. Shout out to Brett.
[08:45.630 --> 08:47.950]  Thanks for all the support. Thanks for the Terp love. For sure.
[08:48.470 --> 08:50.990]  You guys want to talk about that new stupid Instagram feature?
[08:51.950 --> 08:54.230]  I want to just give it a second. There's a new feature on Instagram.
[08:54.230 --> 08:56.150]  I don't know if I care or not. I don't know if I like it.
[08:56.510 --> 08:57.350]  It's kind of Snapchat.
[08:57.790 --> 09:02.150]  I don't give out my Instagram is because I don't even use it. All right.
[09:02.190 --> 09:05.870]  Like I've, I only open it when it says I have a bunch of notifications and then
[09:05.870 --> 09:09.310]  I only open it to clear the notifications. It just feels like it never ends.
[09:09.390 --> 09:12.350]  There's just so many pictures that scroll by. I'm like, I don't even care.
[09:12.350 --> 09:14.430]  I forgot. I forgot that I don't care. That's right.
[09:14.990 --> 09:19.870]  I think what you have to remember is that Instagram was originally
[09:19.870 --> 09:20.830]  just pictures.
[09:22.310 --> 09:27.030]  Look at how far Instagram has actually evolved and what it
[09:27.070 --> 09:28.790]  actually started from.
[09:29.070 --> 09:32.150]  Can you really hate them for doing a live feature?
[09:33.590 --> 09:37.830]  Not even. Um, I don't know.
[09:37.910 --> 09:42.790]  I don't really like, I have pros and cons about it, so I just don't really.
[09:43.710 --> 09:45.870]  I just feel like they're trying to suck up too much of my attention.
[09:46.110 --> 09:49.550]  Now I can scroll up and down and left and right. And it just fucks me all up.
[09:49.590 --> 09:53.270]  There's no end and there's no end to it now. Cause there's so there's,
[09:53.310 --> 09:56.070]  I'm just like, Oh, that's enough. I have to stop. All right.
[09:56.190 --> 09:58.910]  Since we're talking about social media, this is a good segue. Uh,
[09:58.950 --> 09:59.830]  Twitter people,
[09:59.830 --> 10:03.870]  I've got three names of folks that I have got envelopes with your name written
[10:03.870 --> 10:05.230]  on it. There's a stamp on there.
[10:05.230 --> 10:08.470]  There's a return address label on there that someone claimed it was mediocre,
[10:08.470 --> 10:10.870]  but I think it's just fun. It's going to work just fine.
[10:10.870 --> 10:12.790]  There's a return address label on there. If that gets lost,
[10:12.790 --> 10:14.470]  it will get back to me. I'll get it back to you.
[10:14.710 --> 10:16.670]  Those of you that receive these,
[10:16.950 --> 10:19.710]  feel free to comment about the quality of the labels and Twitter.
[10:19.750 --> 10:21.630]  Please do. We'd love to hear your comments. Uh,
[10:21.630 --> 10:23.390]  there will be stickers in there for you. Uh,
[10:23.470 --> 10:27.550]  those are to say thank you for participating in Twitter challenges or just for
[10:27.550 --> 10:30.310]  being a friend. If you guys want some stickers, contact me, hit me up on Facebook,
[10:30.310 --> 10:32.990]  hit me up on Instagram, hit me up on the Twitter, or you can email me.
[10:32.990 --> 10:34.590]  It's a girl from your heart at hotmail.com.
[10:34.750 --> 10:38.590]  The real trick is to listen to the whole episode when it's a longer one.
[10:38.990 --> 10:41.950]  Yes, that does help out. That pays off. Uh,
[10:42.910 --> 10:45.870]  but seriously, if you follow me on Twitter or Instagram or something,
[10:45.870 --> 10:49.870]  send me a message. Instagram is IRI, I R I E underscore genetics,
[10:49.870 --> 10:53.990]  IRI genetics. Uh, if you used to be following me, you might not now,
[10:53.990 --> 10:56.710]  because a long time ago they crushed my account and I've started a new account.
[10:57.110 --> 11:00.990]  I had like almost 20,000 followers. I'm only around six or 7,000 now.
[11:01.230 --> 11:04.550]  So come follow me again, please. That would be cool. Uh, on Twitter,
[11:04.550 --> 11:08.350]  it's at GFYH podcast on Facebook. It's grow from your heart podcast.
[11:08.350 --> 11:12.030]  And of course there's the email that I like to say that it's grown from your
[11:12.030 --> 11:15.350]  heart at hotmail.com. Go search for me there. Find me, email me, contact me.
[11:15.470 --> 11:17.470]  I'd love to hear from you. He gives you some stickers. Uh,
[11:17.550 --> 11:19.790]  so these friends of mine are going to get some stickers,
[11:19.790 --> 11:22.630]  big shout out to James Howlett. You're going to get some stickers in the mail.
[11:22.830 --> 11:26.430]  Jason Hawkins, you got stickers coming in the mail and Sammy, bro.
[11:26.430 --> 11:29.470]  You got some stickers coming in the mail, bro. My painted chef friend.
[11:29.910 --> 11:34.070]  Also that segues right into the next part. How you guys like that? Double segue.
[11:34.070 --> 11:36.430]  We're doing a grateful dead style one right into the other.
[11:36.430 --> 11:40.590]  We're not going to stop. Keep on jamming. Uh, Sammy asked about easy cloners.
[11:41.430 --> 11:43.790]  His basic question was, uh, do you recommend an easy cloner?
[11:43.790 --> 11:47.270]  Do you like an easy cloner? Uh, yes. I love an easy cloner.
[11:47.990 --> 11:51.630]  What I really like about an easy cloner is you can cut large clones. Uh,
[11:51.670 --> 11:55.870]  if you take big clones, they'll root quickly. And those big clones,
[11:55.870 --> 11:58.990]  I think they take off much more quickly than clones and rock wool cubes.
[11:59.190 --> 12:02.270]  Mike remembers my old school days of trying to cut clones and rock wool cubes.
[12:02.990 --> 12:06.590]  I took so many clones and put them in a rock wool cubes.
[12:06.610 --> 12:09.310]  I did that for a lot of years with a lot of different growers. Yeah.
[12:09.310 --> 12:12.350]  Mike used to be like a grow hand for everybody around here. And honestly,
[12:12.590 --> 12:16.670]  the easy cloner is a huge step up. It's a, in my mind,
[12:16.670 --> 12:21.630]  if you're growing, uh, and cloning regularly, it's worth the investment.
[12:22.230 --> 12:25.270]  Uh, just make sure you get a good one. Do you remember your first easy cloner,
[12:25.270 --> 12:27.270]  bro? Yeah. Let's not talk too much about that. No,
[12:27.270 --> 12:29.950]  but two seconds after you would plug it in your,
[12:29.990 --> 12:32.670]  your advice would have been don't buy one that crap. Yeah.
[12:32.670 --> 12:35.950]  Those old ones sucked. The new models are awesome. Yeah. They,
[12:35.950 --> 12:37.430]  they worked out all the kinks.
[12:37.470 --> 12:41.830]  It doesn't explode and turn your grow room into a water park anymore.
[12:42.190 --> 12:45.910]  That's the best description. There are new models. The new easy cloners,
[12:45.910 --> 12:49.030]  the low, uh, what do they call them? The low rise, the low profile models.
[12:49.030 --> 12:52.230]  They're white. Now I really dig them. They require less water,
[12:52.990 --> 12:55.390]  which is really helpful because that also means less nutrients.
[12:55.870 --> 12:59.110]  I'm only familiar with the big black beast, but it gets the double thumbs.
[12:59.110 --> 13:02.350]  It's the same thing, but just a new design. They, they used to leak.
[13:02.350 --> 13:04.830]  Remember how the old black ones used to spray out of the sides.
[13:04.830 --> 13:07.510]  Cause they had the drip a little. They don't leak or drip anymore.
[13:07.510 --> 13:09.870]  The new design is way better. They're easier to clean.
[13:10.070 --> 13:12.350]  I really like the new easy cloner. So Sammy, if you're,
[13:12.510 --> 13:15.150]  if you're looking to up your clone game, get yourself an easy cloner.
[13:15.390 --> 13:18.110]  It is super easy to use that thing. You need a healthy mother. Okay.
[13:18.110 --> 13:21.310]  Get your cloner set up by that. I mean, get the cloner fucking built,
[13:21.510 --> 13:24.190]  get the neoprenes in there, get the little manifold in there, get it,
[13:24.190 --> 13:27.870]  spray and get it running, fill it up with water just below those red sprayers.
[13:28.350 --> 13:30.550]  Uh, remember how much water you put in it, figure that out,
[13:30.910 --> 13:33.190]  put nutrients in there. I would use a little bit of bloom,
[13:33.470 --> 13:37.710]  like your base blue nutrient, a little bit of micro and just dip them in some,
[13:37.710 --> 13:41.550]  uh, I like to use the, uh, the easy cloner gel, the, what that,
[13:41.550 --> 13:43.110]  what's that one called? Should I can't think of the name?
[13:43.110 --> 13:45.390]  Clonex it's the purple Clonex gel. I can use that shit.
[13:45.830 --> 13:48.350]  Dip it in there, put it in the little neoprene collar,
[13:48.430 --> 13:51.750]  cut it to where there's like two or three nodes underneath that collar.
[13:51.990 --> 13:56.110]  Put that shit in the cloner, put the cloner on for 45 minutes on 15 minutes off,
[13:56.110 --> 13:59.670]  because that water will heat up because of that pump. Uh, put a T five light,
[13:59.670 --> 14:03.510]  about a foot above that. And just let the T five light run 24 hours a day.
[14:03.830 --> 14:05.270]  And no shit in like seven or eight days,
[14:05.270 --> 14:07.350]  you'll start seeing little warts pop out of the plant.
[14:07.350 --> 14:09.750]  And that's where the roots are going to grow. Like 10 to 14 days,
[14:09.750 --> 14:12.190]  you'll have savage roots and 17 to 21 days.
[14:12.430 --> 14:13.550]  Those roots are going to be so big.
[14:13.550 --> 14:15.550]  You'll have to go to a three gallon pot and skip a cup.
[14:16.190 --> 14:20.430]  Um, a huge step up in technology from the old school clone domes.
[14:20.470 --> 14:23.710]  Huge step up. So I highly, highly recommend those. We use those at the grow.
[14:23.710 --> 14:26.750]  I run a big commercial girl and I've got one, two, three,
[14:26.990 --> 14:30.270]  there are six easy cloners filled with clones right now at the grow.
[14:30.670 --> 14:31.510]  And that's how we keep it.
[14:31.710 --> 14:34.110]  We could go on like this about the cloner for a while.
[14:34.110 --> 14:35.390]  It's really an awesome product.
[14:35.510 --> 14:37.910]  So easy corner. If you'd like to send me some easy cloners, hit me up.
[14:37.910 --> 14:39.110]  It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[14:39.710 --> 14:42.350]  I could just use like one 60 side or one 90 site, you know,
[14:42.350 --> 14:45.030]  just my personal setup. I don't need anything for the, for the store.
[14:45.350 --> 14:49.190]  Just send me one. I'd appreciate that. Um, yeah. All right. So Sammy,
[14:49.190 --> 14:51.030]  I hope I answered your question, bro. I hope it's not too late.
[14:51.030 --> 14:53.430]  I know that took me a while to get to that message. I apologize.
[14:53.750 --> 14:55.350]  I do one episode a week. I need to fix that.
[14:55.710 --> 14:57.990]  If I did two a week I could probably get more questions answered.
[14:57.990 --> 15:00.590]  That's what I think. Lindsay, you all right over there. Headphones. All right.
[15:00.670 --> 15:04.750]  No, my ear. You get that. You get headphone ear. No, it's, I have a,
[15:04.910 --> 15:06.310]  you have a ear. I have, yeah.
[15:06.310 --> 15:11.190]  Never hear it's not even worth it tonight.
[15:11.190 --> 15:13.190]  I don't feel like it's kind of late at night. Lindsay's real high.
[15:13.190 --> 15:17.510]  So picking on her is way too sad. We got good and fried to start. Yes. All right.
[15:17.510 --> 15:21.030]  Mike just segued us right in again. He's jamming us right into the next topic.
[15:21.310 --> 15:23.630]  On the last episode, we talked a lot about dabbing and stuff.
[15:23.630 --> 15:26.750]  And I wanted to talk about email temperature and getting your email set to the
[15:26.750 --> 15:29.230]  temperature that is perfect for you.
[15:29.230 --> 15:32.630]  Because I like my email a little bit hot. If Spence was here,
[15:32.990 --> 15:34.790]  Spencer from Gardner Whedon shout out to my brother, Spencer.
[15:35.030 --> 15:36.670]  It would crack me up every time he did this.
[15:36.670 --> 15:39.550]  Spence would reach right over and just turn my email down. Like motherfucker.
[15:39.550 --> 15:41.470]  That's too hot. And he was just like, Oh,
[15:41.470 --> 15:45.750]  that lightly scold you for leaving having it too hot. Yeah. But you know,
[15:45.750 --> 15:49.630]  it's my email and I like them hot. Well, it was just a beautiful thing to watch.
[15:49.630 --> 15:52.910]  It was pretty funny. It was pretty funny, but I just let Spence do his thing.
[15:52.910 --> 15:55.550]  He's a hash maker and he would bring over slabs and dab me out with them.
[15:55.550 --> 15:56.870]  And you could make it whatever temp you want.
[15:56.870 --> 15:58.910]  If you're going to drop that much hash on there, do your thing player.
[15:59.350 --> 16:02.390]  But most people keep their emails a little lower than I do.
[16:02.390 --> 16:04.230]  I like mine a little hot. Somebody was asking me,
[16:04.230 --> 16:06.590]  how do I get my email to the perfect temperature?
[16:07.110 --> 16:09.990]  The temperature is all kind of subjective. It's all about,
[16:10.190 --> 16:13.430]  do you want it hot and hurdy? Do you want it low temp, all taste?
[16:13.990 --> 16:17.270]  That some of the new trend is to heat a nail. And this is not the email.
[16:17.270 --> 16:20.070]  This is if you're using like a banger, the new trend is to heat the nail,
[16:20.630 --> 16:25.350]  let it get way too hot and then let it cool way down and then put your dab on
[16:25.350 --> 16:29.070]  there and waste half the fucking dab and then act like it tasted real good.
[16:29.270 --> 16:30.790]  And then get a Q-tip and clean it off.
[16:31.030 --> 16:32.430]  That's what all the trendy kids are doing now.
[16:32.430 --> 16:34.950]  That's what you see at all the events. That is not my style.
[16:35.270 --> 16:38.790]  I like to heat it and when it's hot enough to cook the dab,
[16:39.070 --> 16:41.390]  I drop a real big dab on it and make sure it all cooks.
[16:41.390 --> 16:44.950]  And I get a big thick fat milky hit that makes my eyes water and makes my lungs
[16:44.950 --> 16:47.870]  kind of Twitter a little bit. And I put a carb cap on it, make it even fatter.
[16:48.230 --> 16:49.350]  And I like to get a fat dad.
[16:49.670 --> 16:52.670]  So setting the email to the perfect temp is kind of subjective for you.
[16:53.190 --> 16:57.230]  The way I would say to do it and use a carb cap, uh, definitely use a carb cap.
[16:57.590 --> 17:00.270]  Or actually went and Googled apart about a carb cap.
[17:00.270 --> 17:02.110]  Let's talk about a carb cap for a second here.
[17:02.350 --> 17:05.550]  This actually comes from high times magazine and it was written.
[17:05.550 --> 17:09.510]  I wrote it down. It's written by Sean black. It says like this,
[17:09.510 --> 17:12.670]  the carb cap is exactly what it sounds like. The carburetor for your rig.
[17:12.710 --> 17:16.110]  It restricts restricts. What the fuck does that word mean?
[17:16.110 --> 17:18.710]  It restricts the amount of airflow to your nail,
[17:18.990 --> 17:23.990]  allowing you to collect the last bits of your oil to punctuate the end of your
[17:24.430 --> 17:27.030]  hit by cat. And this is the part that's important by capping the nail.
[17:27.030 --> 17:31.030]  You restrict the airflow into the rig through the small contact area between
[17:31.030 --> 17:33.790]  the cap and the edge of the nail. While inhaling strongly,
[17:33.790 --> 17:37.350]  the reduced airflow places the entire rig under low pressure,
[17:37.350 --> 17:41.670]  including the oil that pulled on the nail without vaporizing under low pressure.
[17:41.670 --> 17:46.070]  Every component of the hash oil suddenly has a lower boiling temperature. Uh,
[17:46.070 --> 17:48.470]  what once boiled, it should say, which,
[17:48.670 --> 17:52.190]  which once boiled at high temperatures can now do so at much lower temperatures,
[17:52.550 --> 17:55.630]  giving you a bloom of thicker, better tasting smoke.
[17:55.910 --> 17:59.670]  The carb cap lets you actually finish the dab instead of wasting it in a thick
[17:59.710 --> 18:02.070]  sputtering puddle. The trend now, you guys,
[18:02.070 --> 18:05.470]  is that thick sputtering puddle because everyone wants to taste the turps.
[18:05.470 --> 18:07.510]  Turps is the new word. Turps is the new thing.
[18:08.390 --> 18:10.910]  I like that carb cap description there. So you get your email,
[18:11.350 --> 18:14.990]  you guys set it too hot, set it too low. Just go one direction.
[18:15.070 --> 18:18.390]  I recommend just slowly climb up. Um,
[18:18.430 --> 18:22.710]  you're you're looking for the sweet spot in between wasting a lot of your product
[18:22.750 --> 18:26.150]  and burning the living fuck out of your throat. Like I did to myself last night.
[18:26.190 --> 18:30.310]  How far away right now is my finger from the top of that nail inch and a half.
[18:30.630 --> 18:31.550]  Perfect. That's what I thought.
[18:32.030 --> 18:35.950]  So put your fingers an inch to two inches above the nail and it should be able
[18:35.950 --> 18:39.550]  to sit there comfortably for like one or two seconds before like, Ooh,
[18:39.550 --> 18:42.110]  that's hot. It should feel like your fingers getting pinched.
[18:42.110 --> 18:43.990]  Like someone just pinching your finger a little bit.
[18:44.310 --> 18:46.550]  That's about the right temperature where I like it. You agree?
[18:46.910 --> 18:48.790]  Kind of feels like you're getting pinched after a couple seconds.
[18:49.150 --> 18:52.790]  So the toy that I should have now that I don't is a laser town.
[18:53.190 --> 18:55.750]  Oh, I've got one of those. I have one at home too.
[18:55.790 --> 18:57.110]  It's literally,
[18:57.110 --> 19:00.590]  I've left the house with money in my pocket to go buy one a couple of times and
[19:00.590 --> 19:03.950]  something happens and I ended up at home without one. Um,
[19:03.990 --> 19:07.070]  it's just not in the cards cause it's not necessary. It's,
[19:07.110 --> 19:08.190]  it's just something I want.
[19:08.230 --> 19:12.790]  I might have to remind me of this conversation in a much sober
[19:12.870 --> 19:14.270]  right. It just happened here.
[19:15.750 --> 19:17.390]  It depends on what kind of hash you're smoking. Also,
[19:17.390 --> 19:19.870]  if you're smoking shatter like this shatter, you can put it on there.
[19:19.870 --> 19:23.590]  Kind of hot. I've had some wax. I'd probably go hotter if I smoke in libraries,
[19:23.590 --> 19:26.110]  I might turn it down just a bit to get more of that taste.
[19:26.430 --> 19:29.950]  So it depends on the concentrate you've got. You guys get the concentrate that
[19:29.950 --> 19:32.590]  you've got, get the nail set a little bit low, put the dab on there.
[19:32.590 --> 19:35.110]  If it doesn't put the carb cap on, start smoking.
[19:35.110 --> 19:36.550]  If that dad doesn't melt enough,
[19:36.590 --> 19:40.350]  obviously turn that shit up and just go five or 10 degrees higher every time
[19:40.350 --> 19:41.830]  until you get the dab you want.
[19:42.190 --> 19:44.310]  I can't recommend the carb cap enough.
[19:44.550 --> 19:48.790]  The first time you use one, when you throw it on top of the nail,
[19:49.070 --> 19:53.310]  the first thing that goes through your head is where'd all that come from is you
[19:53.310 --> 19:57.790]  watch the vapor going through your rig quadruple and thicken. Um,
[19:57.830 --> 19:59.910]  because that wasn't on your nail a second ago,
[19:59.910 --> 20:01.710]  had you taken a breath and hit it,
[20:01.750 --> 20:03.430]  you wouldn't have gotten any of that.
[20:03.430 --> 20:06.830]  And suddenly you've got a huge milked out rig going for you again.
[20:07.110 --> 20:10.430]  It's so sweet. I love just when you cap it and you just see it and you just
[20:10.430 --> 20:12.110]  start pulling like, ah, there you go.
[20:12.230 --> 20:14.230]  Yup. That's part of the reason I've been so baked.
[20:14.230 --> 20:18.110]  The last couple of shows I've done is cause I didn't have one at home for the
[20:18.110 --> 20:22.950]  last several months and was not getting nearly as stoned at home because I
[20:22.950 --> 20:24.270]  didn't have all the tools with me.
[20:24.430 --> 20:26.790]  So when you drop the carb cap on there, you guys, you're pulling your hit,
[20:26.790 --> 20:28.910]  you're taking your hit and then you get enough smoke to fill your lungs.
[20:28.910 --> 20:31.070]  You want to blow out so that you could pull the rest of that.
[20:31.430 --> 20:35.470]  Don't take the carb cap off because at that time you're letting all that vapor
[20:35.470 --> 20:38.070]  and that pressure and that vacuum that you've created,
[20:38.070 --> 20:40.030]  you've just ruined that by letting the carb cap off,
[20:40.030 --> 20:42.870]  leave that carb cap on there almost until you're done dabbing.
[20:42.870 --> 20:44.990]  Sometimes it's a good idea to lift it cause that fucker gets hot,
[20:45.390 --> 20:48.510]  but just put it on there. Inhale, blow your head out, leave the cap on,
[20:48.510 --> 20:52.110]  inhale the rest and then take it off as soon as you're done. Uh, don't,
[20:52.150 --> 20:53.790]  don't take it off until you're done dabbing.
[20:53.790 --> 20:57.150]  Cause a lot of folks lose part of their dab that I've seen people feather them
[20:57.150 --> 21:00.190]  and try to get fancy with it and just set it on there and let her go.
[21:00.510 --> 21:02.830]  One thing I do, I honestly do turn it a little bit.
[21:02.830 --> 21:05.350]  There's one hole in there and the top of that carb cap.
[21:05.350 --> 21:07.830]  And I like to turn it just because I think that I move my,
[21:08.230 --> 21:09.550]  I take a larger dab than most folks.
[21:09.550 --> 21:10.670]  I agree with you and that's one of the things.
[21:10.670 --> 21:13.870]  So I need to spread it across the top of the nail just a little bit more than
[21:13.870 --> 21:17.110]  some, and I'm not trying to be an elitist, I just take big fucking dabs.
[21:17.150 --> 21:18.470]  When we're talking temperature,
[21:18.510 --> 21:23.510]  I can get away with a much lower temp and not waste anything because I'm putting
[21:23.910 --> 21:27.190]  a much smaller dab to the nail each time.
[21:29.190 --> 21:33.510]  You can't do a low temp half gram or a gram dab.
[21:34.430 --> 21:38.910]  You end up doing a 0.2 dab and the rest of it puddles and then you feel like a
[21:38.910 --> 21:41.790]  dick for wasting a bunch of your hat.
[21:41.790 --> 21:43.830]  So that I want, I want to mention one more thing.
[21:43.830 --> 21:46.670]  And then you just kind of segued me into another part I want to talk about.
[21:47.070 --> 21:50.590]  You guys, when you're taking a dab with a carb cap and you're using an email,
[21:51.030 --> 21:54.630]  um, this happened at the Cana Canyon and it happens here occasionally.
[21:54.830 --> 21:57.670]  I just wanted to bring this up for the folks that are learning to dab and even
[21:57.670 --> 22:00.830]  the experienced dabbers brah, when you're done dabbing,
[22:01.510 --> 22:06.110]  take the carb cap off the email because that email is turned on and it's hot and
[22:06.110 --> 22:08.990]  you leave that carb cap on there and it heats up the carb cap.
[22:09.310 --> 22:12.350]  And then whoever, whoever sees it wants to take a dab.
[22:12.350 --> 22:13.910]  They're not thinking about that as hot.
[22:13.950 --> 22:17.190]  They're thinking I want to dab and they reach for the carb cap and they burn the
[22:17.190 --> 22:21.270]  shit out of themselves. So be careful. Please take that. Yeah.
[22:21.270 --> 22:25.310]  Please take that carb cap off of the email. Just set it on an oil slick pad.
[22:25.670 --> 22:27.910]  I see so many people, there's an oil slick pad on my table.
[22:27.910 --> 22:31.630]  This pad is designed to catch hash. It will not stick to here.
[22:31.750 --> 22:34.910]  My table right here, this wood part, the hash will stick to this all fucking day.
[22:35.350 --> 22:39.190]  Uh, put, just put the, put the carb cap down on the oil slick pad. If you see one,
[22:39.230 --> 22:42.190]  that's what that's for. Utilize that. All right.
[22:42.430 --> 22:46.350]  Now I said that would segue me into another part that I wanted to talk about.
[22:47.670 --> 22:52.670]  When we're giving dabs to somebody, is it up to me to heat that?
[22:53.230 --> 22:55.590]  I feel like if I give you a dab and I'm like,
[22:55.590 --> 22:56.910]  this will be another question I'm going to ask.
[22:57.070 --> 22:59.630]  One of us pulls a dab off the parchment paper for you.
[22:59.870 --> 23:03.070]  I'll heat the rig to be nice just because we're dabbing at my spot or in my car
[23:03.070 --> 23:06.270]  or wherever we happen to be. I'm going to heat this. I know Mike, I know.
[23:06.270 --> 23:08.790]  I'm sorry. I'm going to heat the nail to the appropriate temperature.
[23:09.070 --> 23:09.510]  And then I'm going to,
[23:09.510 --> 23:12.230]  maybe we're camping and I'm going to heat and I'm going to heat the nail to the
[23:12.230 --> 23:14.310]  appropriate temperature and I'm going to hand it to you.
[23:14.550 --> 23:18.270]  Do I hang onto that fucker until it's the right temp or do I give it to you and
[23:18.270 --> 23:20.990]  let you decide when to dab that thing?
[23:21.350 --> 23:22.190]  Yeah.
[23:23.150 --> 23:26.950]  That so much just depends on who you're talking about handing it to and that
[23:26.950 --> 23:28.310]  level of experience.
[23:28.350 --> 23:30.230]  So that that's what I was just going to say.
[23:30.230 --> 23:35.310]  If it's someone new and new to dabbing, I would just be like, okay,
[23:35.510 --> 23:38.430]  like I would just probably hold on to it until it was ready and then give it to
[23:38.450 --> 23:42.910]  him. But if it's somebody, you know, dabs a lot,
[23:43.470 --> 23:44.750]  let them make that choice.
[23:44.750 --> 23:47.350]  Heat it up, hand it to them, let them do the hand over the nail,
[23:47.350 --> 23:48.270]  like a wizard trick.
[23:48.670 --> 23:51.590]  Because do you remember a couple of weeks ago when we were having a
[23:51.590 --> 23:55.030]  conversation about how somebody heated up a torch for like a,
[23:55.710 --> 23:57.750]  this is all about. Yeah, that's where this came from.
[23:58.390 --> 24:01.430]  Somebody tried to be nice and give me a big fat dab and they heated the nail
[24:01.430 --> 24:03.310]  nice and hot. And when I went to pick up the rig,
[24:03.510 --> 24:07.590]  they put their hand on it and said, it's too hot. And I try, I'm polite.
[24:07.590 --> 24:09.590]  I'm like, cool, you're giving me a dab. I'll let you do your thing.
[24:09.990 --> 24:13.510]  But in my mind I thought it's going to cool down way too much in this big dab is
[24:13.510 --> 24:15.230]  just going to end up as a puddle on your nail.
[24:15.710 --> 24:18.870]  And these guys are like proud of how much they clean out of their rig with the
[24:18.870 --> 24:23.470]  Q-tip. And I want to smoke that bro. Put that in my lungs. We paid for it.
[24:23.950 --> 24:27.230]  The dispensary wasn't like, Oh, you're going to Q-tip it. Here's 30% off.
[24:27.510 --> 24:30.430]  I don't understand how people can waste that amount of hat.
[24:30.470 --> 24:35.550]  It's like when you're paying 20, 30, 60, 80, a hundred a gram
[24:36.030 --> 24:36.910]  for hash,
[24:36.990 --> 24:41.150]  how do you waste half of it on the just letting it puddle and then Q-tipping it
[24:41.150 --> 24:42.110]  into the trash?
[24:42.950 --> 24:46.270]  That's like taking two sips off your beer and putting the whole bottle,
[24:46.270 --> 24:48.990]  the rest of the bottle of the trash and ordering another beer and driving that
[24:48.990 --> 24:50.430]  way all night. Like, what are you doing?
[24:50.430 --> 24:54.550]  So if it's an experienced dabber, if you're an, if it's an experienced ever,
[24:54.550 --> 24:56.550]  let that dude choose how hot he wants it. If I want to,
[24:56.830 --> 25:00.070]  if I want to burn my lungs, if I want to roast my esophagus, let me,
[25:00.150 --> 25:00.990]  let me do it please.
[25:01.150 --> 25:05.070]  But when you're bringing new people in, be gentle. Um,
[25:05.110 --> 25:07.430]  a lot of us have a good story about the,
[25:07.470 --> 25:10.550]  the introducing someone to hash where they were like, no,
[25:10.830 --> 25:15.430]  I want to take the hit you took and we give it one or two. No,
[25:15.430 --> 25:19.310]  you don't bro. Like just a bit of advice, go slow,
[25:19.750 --> 25:22.510]  very strong and they resist a little bit.
[25:22.510 --> 25:26.550]  So we say fuck it and let them jump off the cliff. That's not necessarily.
[25:26.590 --> 25:28.830]  I've told this story of the dude, uh, a guy,
[25:28.830 --> 25:32.270]  I was at a cannabis company that's taking dabs and a guy walked up and he's
[25:32.270 --> 25:34.350]  like, what are you doing there, bro? And I was like smoking dabs.
[25:34.350 --> 25:36.590]  And he's like, I ain't never seen dabs before. Can I get a dad?
[25:36.590 --> 25:37.150]  And I was like, sure.
[25:37.150 --> 25:40.310]  And I gave him what I thought would be a normal first dad for a guy.
[25:40.590 --> 25:43.710]  And he got offended. He's like, that's a little, little, I saw what you smoke.
[25:43.710 --> 25:46.150]  Give me what you smoked. And I was like, I've been doing this, bro.
[25:46.150 --> 25:48.830]  That's going to fuck you up. Cause I don't care. I'm I'm, I can smoke.
[25:49.350 --> 25:52.790]  And so I did what he asked for. And I gave him a Jeff size dab, heated up,
[25:52.790 --> 25:53.630]  hooked him up.
[25:53.710 --> 25:57.710]  That dude took that hit and pulled in the smoke and blew it out and vanished.
[25:57.830 --> 26:00.870]  He walked into the crowd like, bye, I gotta go. He was so high.
[26:00.870 --> 26:03.390]  He didn't know what to do with himself. He couldn't look me in the eye anymore.
[26:03.590 --> 26:06.390]  He was done, but I thought it was kind of funny,
[26:06.630 --> 26:11.190]  but I smashed like a good chunk of my day explaining to people who aren't
[26:11.190 --> 26:15.950]  familiar with hash and edibles to, to please go slow. Um,
[26:16.310 --> 26:20.790]  I talk to people all the time that have, uh, I, I took the way too big a dab.
[26:21.190 --> 26:25.350]  And it was like the longest 12 hours of my life while I waited to come down.
[26:26.110 --> 26:29.190]  Um, and I feel bad for those people and it's unnecessary.
[26:29.190 --> 26:31.190]  Like we used to be a little gentler with it.
[26:31.750 --> 26:36.030]  And there used to be an initiation process before these products were available.
[26:36.630 --> 26:40.430]  Um, and it negated the necessity to do, to,
[26:40.430 --> 26:41.870]  to say that a lot of this stuff,
[26:41.870 --> 26:45.110]  there are people out there whose first experience with cannabis was a dab.
[26:45.670 --> 26:47.150]  Yeah. That's unfair.
[26:47.670 --> 26:52.310]  That's like the first time you drank when you were in middle school or a teenager
[26:52.310 --> 26:56.350]  or whatever, you had moonshine and you guys were fucking beer funneling it.
[26:56.790 --> 26:59.670]  It's, it's so unnecessary.
[27:00.510 --> 27:01.350]  Oh God.
[27:02.070 --> 27:03.910]  That they're boof and shine for your first time.
[27:04.350 --> 27:07.390]  Like it's like, why would you do that? And it's the same thing when I hear,
[27:07.390 --> 27:12.390]  like my first, my first intro to marijuana was, uh,
[27:12.830 --> 27:16.830]  a giant dab alive resident. And it's like in, in what happened next,
[27:16.870 --> 27:20.430]  you spent seven hours in your hotel room wondering if you were dead or not.
[27:20.910 --> 27:24.990]  And it's just, you were too big to handle it. And it never should have happened.
[27:24.990 --> 27:27.630]  Like you didn't need to be in that end of the pool. Go slow.
[27:27.870 --> 27:31.190]  Do I need to put a disclaimer on my dad videos? Do not try this at home.
[27:31.350 --> 27:32.190]  Probably.
[27:32.190 --> 27:33.350]  That might be a good idea, huh?
[27:34.430 --> 27:38.430]  So I think what that going back to your original question here, Jeff,
[27:38.510 --> 27:43.310]  I think it's about knowing your audience and about knowing like who's in your
[27:43.310 --> 27:48.430]  car. Like if it's a, you know, experienced dabber, let them do it.
[27:48.430 --> 27:51.790]  But if not, then, uh, whatever. Screw you guys.
[27:52.790 --> 27:53.870]  That's the worst night.
[27:55.270 --> 27:58.550]  I'm sitting here mostly looking at my, no, no, we're, we're,
[27:58.550 --> 28:00.830]  we're mad at ourselves because we're setting a bad example.
[28:00.830 --> 28:02.870]  We're talking about dabbing in the car, which shouldn't happen.
[28:02.870 --> 28:07.430]  We're hypocrites. We're, uh, I didn't even mean in the car. I just meant in general.
[28:07.870 --> 28:08.830]  Did I say in the car?
[28:08.830 --> 28:13.470]  We've all I, you and I each have slipped about dabbing in the car. Yeah.
[28:13.670 --> 28:16.390]  Like we're outdoorsy. It's Colorado. We spent a lot of time.
[28:19.030 --> 28:23.270]  I actually do take, I do smoke a lot more in nature.
[28:23.390 --> 28:26.230]  I think it's fucking fun to dab in the carwash when you're getting the carwash.
[28:26.670 --> 28:27.510]  I've never done that before.
[28:28.790 --> 28:30.750]  No one can see you. You're just blasting dabs.
[28:30.750 --> 28:33.510]  I don't dab in the car. I don't, none of my shit's portable.
[28:33.550 --> 28:36.470]  Like that's not something I do. It's all portable to me, bro. Yeah.
[28:36.470 --> 28:41.430]  I've had the, yeah, no, I know. I know they make an adapter for the Eno.
[28:41.430 --> 28:43.270]  It's a beautiful thing. Yes they do. All right. Let's get,
[28:43.270 --> 28:46.990]  let's get out of the incrimination zone here. Um, so dab size,
[28:47.110 --> 28:50.590]  I like the temp thing. If it's somebody new, yeah. If it, yeah.
[28:51.750 --> 28:55.550]  Just bring them along. Maybe decide the temp for your girlfriend's dab for her,
[28:55.550 --> 28:59.590]  but it's such a wonderful, we can decide our own, our own temp of our own dabs.
[28:59.590 --> 29:00.870]  We can handle that. If, if,
[29:01.310 --> 29:05.150]  if I'm wearing my logo on my shirt and I'm at every fucking secret session,
[29:05.150 --> 29:08.150]  you see me at, let me choose my temp on my dad. I want to go hot and hurty.
[29:09.270 --> 29:13.630]  Red means go. You guys don't do glowy's that, that, that we call those glowy's.
[29:13.630 --> 29:16.710]  Don't do those. Those hurt your lungs. Those are, don't do that. Yeah.
[29:16.990 --> 29:21.150]  So let's talk about dab size. Uh, we're, we're all friends here.
[29:21.150 --> 29:23.350]  So when we have dabs, we come to the table, we just,
[29:23.350 --> 29:25.870]  there's some of my hash on the table. Lindsay's got some hash on the table.
[29:25.870 --> 29:27.630]  Mike didn't bring any today, but I'm not calling him out.
[29:27.630 --> 29:30.270]  Last time he brought some hash that tasted fucking tremendous.
[29:30.830 --> 29:33.590]  I racked myself with that shit was so flavorful.
[29:33.590 --> 29:37.750]  You're excused this time cause it was so good last time. But we all,
[29:37.790 --> 29:42.390]  if somebody wants a dab, this is my, what is this? This is, uh, this way I do.
[29:42.550 --> 29:46.990]  This is, um, Trez star shatter. Uh, and Mike wants a debit.
[29:46.990 --> 29:48.150]  I'm just going to pass him the parchment.
[29:48.150 --> 29:50.830]  He's going to pull off a dab for himself. Cause that's my homie over there.
[29:51.790 --> 29:55.350]  Is that how are you supposed to, am I supposed to pull him off a dab?
[29:55.350 --> 29:56.950]  Or is that his job? Or
[29:58.710 --> 30:01.990]  I think Lindsay said it perfectly a second ago. It's about knowing your audience.
[30:01.990 --> 30:05.750]  Depends on who's who. Huh? Yeah. I guess that's true. Like,
[30:06.110 --> 30:09.870]  you know, you always get that one kid. Uh, you know, exactly.
[30:09.870 --> 30:13.270]  So say we're hanging out at the secret satch and we're all a bunch of friends.
[30:13.270 --> 30:14.510]  We're a bunch of heads. We're a bunch of family.
[30:14.510 --> 30:16.270]  And there's always one guy in every fucking group.
[30:16.270 --> 30:18.470]  And you know who I'm thinking about right now, that guy,
[30:18.470 --> 30:19.590]  if you hand him your shatter,
[30:19.590 --> 30:21.470]  he's going to try to smoke all of this in one dab,
[30:21.750 --> 30:24.830]  just because he wants to smoke as much as he can while he's there and get as
[30:24.830 --> 30:29.190]  high as he can. Everybody, every group has that one guy, that one friend.
[30:29.790 --> 30:32.790]  Uh, I think it's funny when people ask me for a dab and they try to do that
[30:32.790 --> 30:36.430]  because then I get to watch them cough and turn red and turn purple and blow
[30:36.430 --> 30:38.790]  snot out of their face. It's worth it to me.
[30:41.110 --> 30:45.390]  Now the best part for me is watching them function after that or fail to
[30:45.390 --> 30:48.270]  function. Yeah, exactly. Because you know what, Jeff,
[30:48.270 --> 30:53.270]  the thing about it is is they watch people like you take huge dabs and you know,
[30:54.310 --> 30:57.830]  be able to just take 0.5, you know,
[30:58.070 --> 31:01.030]  or bigger dabs and they sit here and go, well,
[31:01.030 --> 31:05.470]  I can go on this level with this guy and they take this one,
[31:06.030 --> 31:10.110]  they die and then they can't function. And do you know what you do?
[31:10.790 --> 31:15.790]  You continue to take 0.5 or bigger dabs and you keep going through the night and
[31:16.350 --> 31:20.390]  they're just like, what is this guy doing? I've been training bro.
[31:20.950 --> 31:23.470]  Been training. This is your triathlon. I've been going deep.
[31:23.670 --> 31:24.870]  This is your Olympics.
[31:25.430 --> 31:26.790]  It just for comparison,
[31:26.790 --> 31:31.790]  there's more residue on the dabber I just used than the dab I just took.
[31:34.230 --> 31:38.910]  Mike, you're the segue champion because I want to talk about Ninja dabs right
[31:38.950 --> 31:41.310]  now. Oh, I love Ninja dabs.
[31:43.110 --> 31:44.430]  So a lot of people, we've,
[31:44.430 --> 31:47.430]  we take for granted that a lot of folks listening to this podcast are not
[31:47.430 --> 31:50.310]  Colorado based people. I can tell by looking at the stats,
[31:50.310 --> 31:53.230]  I try to ignore them because I don't want it to influence my performance.
[31:53.670 --> 31:56.630]  But I could tell by looking at the stats that a large portion of our audience is
[31:56.650 --> 31:57.350]  in Colorado,
[31:57.350 --> 32:02.350]  but more than 50% is not Colorado based and a large portion is not even in
[32:02.350 --> 32:05.550]  America. Those people don't get to dab. They don't know what dabs are.
[32:06.270 --> 32:08.230]  Somebody put me back on track. Ninja dabs.
[32:08.230 --> 32:10.750]  I'm just saying what the fuck Ninja dabs are. Ninja dabs.
[32:11.390 --> 32:14.470]  So if Lindsay was to get herself a dab and she was to start dabbing,
[32:14.790 --> 32:17.870]  I would sneakily, I've got my Mac book here open. Uh, I would,
[32:17.870 --> 32:19.670]  while she can't see me by behind the computer,
[32:19.670 --> 32:21.470]  I'd put another dab on another dabber.
[32:21.470 --> 32:24.430]  And as soon as Lindsay starts inhaling that dab right before she puts the carb
[32:24.430 --> 32:24.830]  cap on,
[32:24.830 --> 32:29.110]  I would reach over and put a sizable amount of hash on the nail for her and
[32:29.110 --> 32:31.430]  Ninja dabber. Uh, just get that,
[32:31.470 --> 32:34.530]  just add a little to her and make her cough and get her a little extra fucked
[32:34.530 --> 32:35.670]  up more than she expected.
[32:36.350 --> 32:38.310]  I've also seen it, uh,
[32:38.350 --> 32:41.390]  refer to putting a dab underneath the carb cap.
[32:42.150 --> 32:44.430]  So you like the carb cap is just a,
[32:44.430 --> 32:47.670]  it's a hunk of metal with a hole in it that you set on top of the hot nail.
[32:47.990 --> 32:52.430]  So if you take some hash and surreptitiously place it underneath the carb cap
[32:52.910 --> 32:56.750]  while that car or the, while they, their carb caps on their cap and their dab,
[32:56.750 --> 33:00.710]  it's going to heat up enough to drop that on the nail. So yeah, a good three,
[33:00.710 --> 33:04.630]  four, five, 10 seconds into their hit, their hit quadruples all of a sudden.
[33:04.750 --> 33:06.030]  And they don't even know where it came from.
[33:06.390 --> 33:08.070]  That's happened to me more than once.
[33:08.070 --> 33:10.390]  It has led to some less than productive afternoons.
[33:10.430 --> 33:14.710]  I've called those time bombs or, uh, uh, landmines,
[33:14.710 --> 33:17.790]  but I've also heard them called sniper dabs from other folks.
[33:17.950 --> 33:21.310]  I've got multiple landmines and Ninja dabs where it was always what I heard.
[33:21.310 --> 33:21.870]  Those calls,
[33:21.870 --> 33:24.670]  we've got multiple carb caps and I'll just set them out on the table and
[33:24.670 --> 33:26.750]  occasionally one will have a little snake underneath it.
[33:27.390 --> 33:30.150]  Someone will take a dab and it just keeps going and they turn red and they blow
[33:30.150 --> 33:32.030]  snot out of their face and they choke for a few minutes.
[33:32.030 --> 33:33.710]  And it's really funny to me. I laugh a lot.
[33:34.270 --> 33:37.310]  Cause I always know which one it is. It's the blue one. If it ever happens,
[33:37.310 --> 33:40.230]  it's the blue one. I've got one blue one and the rest are silver.
[33:40.270 --> 33:43.670]  So that makes it easy for me to know. Don't use that fucking blue one.
[33:43.670 --> 33:47.990]  If you come over here or do do some people like, yeah, right. Yeah.
[33:48.310 --> 33:52.430]  Um, so let's see, we're talking about dad stuff. I've got notes. Sorry. Uh,
[33:52.470 --> 33:55.310]  let's, let's give some dab hints. It's uh,
[33:55.630 --> 33:59.830]  it's summertime and it's hot as shit here in Colorado and your dads are going to
[33:59.830 --> 34:03.310]  be stuck to the parchment paper and hard to find. Okay. First of all,
[34:03.590 --> 34:08.590]  I saw a dispensary on Instagram today selling their hash in little plastic
[34:08.630 --> 34:12.950]  disks. Uh, fuck that. Step up your game, use parchment paper. It's cheap. Uh,
[34:12.970 --> 34:13.790]  get some parchment paper,
[34:13.830 --> 34:17.190]  put your dabs in parchment paper or one of those like silicone containers.
[34:17.190 --> 34:19.950]  Let's get away from the plastic things where all your dabs stick to it and you
[34:19.950 --> 34:21.310]  got to scrape it for fucking days.
[34:21.310 --> 34:23.390]  You're wasting like a quarter gram of hash in the packaging.
[34:23.390 --> 34:26.750]  No one wants to scrape out of that little plastic dish. Yeah.
[34:26.790 --> 34:28.950]  That's the first time you go to scrape out of it.
[34:28.950 --> 34:33.150]  You realize that it's plastic and half the divers out here aren't gentle enough
[34:33.150 --> 34:37.750]  to, I mean it's, it quickly becomes a question of,
[34:37.910 --> 34:40.230]  am I willing to dab little strips of plastic?
[34:41.110 --> 34:45.910]  Uh, scrape that off my nail or do I just have to kiss the rest of this hash?
[34:45.910 --> 34:50.350]  Go just let it go. Um, yeah. Honestly, step your packaging up a little bit.
[34:50.350 --> 34:53.110]  I'm sensitive to this. I never mind.
[34:53.510 --> 34:55.830]  No, do it. Do it. You're a blood tender. Let us have it.
[34:56.110 --> 34:59.150]  Well, the, like the packaging matters and a lot of people don't think it through
[34:59.150 --> 35:02.830]  to the end stage. They come up with the dope product. I mean,
[35:02.830 --> 35:06.350]  it's like putting a Lamborghini engine in a fucking pinto. Sometimes it's
[35:06.350 --> 35:10.430]  ridiculous. Um, and it's that it's gotta move.
[35:10.670 --> 35:12.830]  It doesn't matter how good your product is.
[35:12.830 --> 35:15.750]  If the packaging is hideous and it's not displayable,
[35:15.990 --> 35:18.750]  it's going to annoy the people that sell it just a little.
[35:19.230 --> 35:20.830]  Even if they're annoyed just a little,
[35:21.070 --> 35:23.910]  they're going to reference the product that isn't annoying more.
[35:24.390 --> 35:26.230]  That's going to move 10 times faster.
[35:26.230 --> 35:28.590]  You're going to make a lot less money all because you didn't think your
[35:28.590 --> 35:32.030]  packaging through to the end. Um, and I mean,
[35:32.030 --> 35:34.550]  we're watching it change in waves in Colorado right now.
[35:34.590 --> 35:38.550]  Every hash company had their cool, unique shaped logo package.
[35:39.070 --> 35:43.070]  And all of those are transitioning to almost identical envelopes now.
[35:43.670 --> 35:46.790]  And you guys are seeing it just as fast as I am up in the Springs. I'm sure.
[35:48.390 --> 35:51.710]  Yeah. It's all folks. Sorry to go on a little tangent,
[35:51.750 --> 35:53.350]  but like the packaging matters.
[35:53.350 --> 35:57.150]  And while the original point of this was it's summer,
[35:57.190 --> 36:00.510]  the shatters a little tacky right now. Um,
[36:00.950 --> 36:04.190]  that's a problem when it's a plastic container. Yeah. Use parchment.
[36:04.190 --> 36:07.190]  But where I was headed with that is, uh, air conditioner tech.
[36:07.190 --> 36:11.030]  You guys, when your shatter is getting all funky, go just set that shatter, uh,
[36:11.070 --> 36:12.110]  put it in a baggie. Well,
[36:12.110 --> 36:14.110]  if you're not going to be in there for more than four or five minutes,
[36:14.110 --> 36:16.830]  you don't have to put it in a baggie. Just set that parchment in the freezer,
[36:16.870 --> 36:19.590]  close the door, make sure you set it on a dry area, close the door,
[36:19.830 --> 36:22.190]  let that shit get nice and cold for a few minutes and pull it out.
[36:22.190 --> 36:23.710]  And now you can function with that shatter.
[36:23.710 --> 36:25.350]  It's going to be a whole lot easier to deal with.
[36:25.350 --> 36:29.670]  It's going to be real snappy, real crunchy. Uh, if you may be, you know,
[36:29.710 --> 36:33.470]  there's an air conditioner in places you can turn on that vent and turn that
[36:33.470 --> 36:36.590]  fucker up, cool down your carb cap, cool down your dabber.
[36:36.990 --> 36:38.670]  And then you can cool down your shatter also,
[36:39.350 --> 36:41.190]  but make it a whole lot easier for you guys to function.
[36:41.270 --> 36:42.110]  That's just honestly,
[36:42.110 --> 36:44.830]  I don't buy a lot of shatter during the summer for this exact reason.
[36:44.830 --> 36:49.150]  I just don't want to bother. Like if I go with a butter or a wax or a live resin,
[36:49.150 --> 36:52.190]  it's already a little tacky or soupy.
[36:52.630 --> 36:54.390]  The room temperature is not going to mess with it much.
[36:54.430 --> 36:56.550]  Ain't no season going to stop me from dabbing.
[36:57.710 --> 37:01.070]  I just got different. This ain't seasonal.
[37:01.150 --> 37:04.990]  This is something I do all day, every day. I'm not no fair weather fan. Right?
[37:05.030 --> 37:08.590]  I just throw that extra money on hash and go live resin all summer.
[37:08.590 --> 37:09.430]  It's not a bad thing.
[37:09.510 --> 37:12.830]  Have you ever been in the cold that were so cold or torch wouldn't light? Yeah,
[37:12.910 --> 37:15.910]  no. It just goes click, click, click. And then one like smoker.
[37:15.910 --> 37:17.950]  I can make fire anywhere, sir.
[37:18.270 --> 37:21.830]  I believe you. I've seen your dedication to your cigarettes.
[37:21.990 --> 37:24.470]  I can make fire anywhere. Guaranteed. Yeah.
[37:24.590 --> 37:26.270]  I wish you had been on my hike yesterday.
[37:26.670 --> 37:30.590]  Yeah. Well me and the hike don't happen in the same sense a lot,
[37:30.630 --> 37:32.990]  but like I could teach you some things.
[37:32.990 --> 37:35.550]  Lindsay seems to be really good at forgetting us fire source.
[37:36.270 --> 37:39.790]  Let's see. That's what us like tumor ridden fucks are for.
[37:40.430 --> 37:42.590]  Like we've always got seven BICs.
[37:43.110 --> 37:46.310]  Like we can find a way to get that nail hot. Give us a minute.
[37:46.390 --> 37:47.150]  So you should always have,
[37:47.150 --> 37:49.270]  you're going to be dabbing and you're on the go and you're going somewhere to
[37:49.270 --> 37:51.310]  dab. Somebody take a can of butane. You have no money,
[37:51.550 --> 37:55.430]  no idea how many times everybody's had everything we've needed to take dabs and
[37:55.430 --> 37:58.750]  nobody had any butane. So I'm the guy with the can of butane in my backpack.
[37:58.750 --> 38:01.030]  So I'm like, I'll treat you guys a fat dab for this butane.
[38:01.030 --> 38:03.670]  And I get the next dab that comes out of that. As soon as that torch is filled,
[38:03.670 --> 38:05.870]  guess who gets a dab? That would be me. Cause I had the butane.
[38:05.870 --> 38:06.710]  I saved the day.
[38:06.750 --> 38:09.990]  I don't know if it's the boy scout in me or the smoker or the stoner,
[38:09.990 --> 38:13.870]  but I've always got a couple of lighters. Like if I'm going to go dab somewhere,
[38:13.870 --> 38:17.470]  I like a can of butane, two torches, two nails,
[38:17.470 --> 38:21.390]  two rigs because rigs get dropped, nails get lost.
[38:22.110 --> 38:26.030]  Like all sorts of weird shit happens and it ruins the session. If, Oh dude,
[38:26.030 --> 38:29.510]  we could all be high right now, but we forgot a part in our weeds fancies.
[38:29.510 --> 38:30.350]  So now we're sober.
[38:30.430 --> 38:33.670]  Lindsay texted me one night. She's like, dude, uh, I'm somewhere.
[38:34.270 --> 38:37.350]  I don't have a rig. I want to smoke some hash. Did you ever rig a no torch?
[38:37.390 --> 38:38.390]  Is that, was that the story?
[38:38.750 --> 38:40.990]  I, yeah, I had a rig and I had no torch.
[38:41.030 --> 38:44.870]  So we say rig and it sounds terrible. By rig we mean a small water pipe.
[38:44.870 --> 38:46.870]  I prefer a smaller, I went over this on another episode,
[38:46.870 --> 38:50.710]  a small pipe with a dab nail on it. Uh, we go domeless nowadays.
[38:50.710 --> 38:54.310]  A lot of us use a, what's called a banger. It's a quartz hash nail. Uh,
[38:54.350 --> 38:57.190]  it looks like a little quartz hash bucket. It's like a bucket. Yeah.
[38:57.190 --> 39:00.550]  It's fucking marvelous. But Lindsay had the pipe and the nail part,
[39:00.550 --> 39:03.790]  but she didn't have a way to make the nail part hot to where she could melt hash
[39:03.790 --> 39:05.310]  on it. Do you remember my advice,
[39:05.590 --> 39:08.150]  the way that I really thought would work for you? Uh,
[39:08.190 --> 39:12.390]  what you gave me too that I thought were actually quite,
[39:13.590 --> 39:17.710]  so you gave me the gas stove, which you know, had electric stove.
[39:18.070 --> 39:21.350]  Oh, sorry. Either way it would have worked. The stove use the damn stove. Right.
[39:21.790 --> 39:25.790]  And then, um, I just take the nail out and heat the nail on the stove for sure.
[39:25.830 --> 39:30.030]  And then the other one was the car, um,
[39:30.070 --> 39:31.270]  the car cigarette lighter.
[39:31.670 --> 39:35.030]  I told her to use the car cigarette lighter as a carb cap on the banger.
[39:35.430 --> 39:38.830]  Like if you just heat that fucker up till it glows and then you drop your dab in
[39:38.830 --> 39:42.470]  the banger and then put the cigarette lighter over it and draw the heat would
[39:42.470 --> 39:44.070]  work just like how the carb cap works.
[39:44.630 --> 39:47.590]  And she didn't try it because she didn't have the fucking cigarette lighter.
[39:47.830 --> 39:50.950]  Mine doesn't work in my car. But yeah, so if you're,
[39:51.190 --> 39:53.030]  if you're screwed and you got a banger,
[39:53.070 --> 39:56.630]  you could probably take a dab by using that cigarette lighter. I've also,
[39:56.870 --> 39:57.710]  I know a little bit.
[39:57.950 --> 40:02.950]  What the nail in the rig is for is it replaces hot knife hits in the world of
[40:03.110 --> 40:06.390]  hash and hot knife hits is exactly what it sounds like.
[40:06.390 --> 40:07.750]  You take two butter knives,
[40:07.750 --> 40:12.430]  you stick them in an electric stove until the tips glow and then mash a piece of
[40:12.430 --> 40:13.070]  hash in the middle.
[40:13.070 --> 40:17.070]  That's how like everyone in Europe got stoned from like 71 to 75.
[40:17.110 --> 40:20.670]  Just to smoke hash like that. My buddy, Sam's fucking kitchen years ago,
[40:20.790 --> 40:22.710]  years and years ago, shot at the Sammy. What's up bro?
[40:22.910 --> 40:23.750]  When, uh,
[40:24.070 --> 40:27.550]  people my parents' age come into the shop and ask for hash,
[40:27.590 --> 40:32.150]  what they're thinking about is hot knife hits or the little pin under the beer
[40:32.190 --> 40:34.630]  mug. They don't even believe that what we have now is hash.
[40:34.630 --> 40:35.710]  Like what is that shit?
[40:35.990 --> 40:39.270]  I literally explained it as this is the new fancy hash.
[40:39.270 --> 40:41.830]  Like that's my intro sentence for them.
[40:42.590 --> 40:46.110]  It's the easiest way to bring them up to speed. But uh, yeah,
[40:46.110 --> 40:48.150]  hot knife hits work on the fancy hash too.
[40:48.150 --> 40:51.270]  It's just a little closer to crack smoke and then most of us likes to get.
[40:51.590 --> 40:56.070]  One time I saw our buddy Kevin took his car cigarette lighter and took a dab and
[40:56.070 --> 40:59.510]  just threw the dab on the car cigarette lighter and inhaled what came off of it.
[41:00.510 --> 41:04.150]  It's, it's portable and functional. I mean,
[41:04.230 --> 41:05.150]  fucking worked for him.
[41:05.230 --> 41:07.630]  And it's easily hidden. You just
[41:10.510 --> 41:12.910]  probably never worked again. I didn't get that far.
[41:13.350 --> 41:14.190]  One time we're at a,
[41:14.350 --> 41:17.990]  we're at a party late one night and we're smoking a bowl and we had shatter and
[41:17.990 --> 41:20.350]  this was before like, like Kevin and I were kind of,
[41:20.350 --> 41:22.070]  we were some of the first dab kids around here.
[41:22.070 --> 41:26.190]  Everyone was smoking weed at the time. Uh, I was, Kevin was made, I,
[41:26.470 --> 41:28.190]  Kevin was making shatter out of the material.
[41:28.190 --> 41:29.950]  I was growing and we're kind of ahead of the curve.
[41:30.270 --> 41:32.990]  So we'd go places and people would have a rig and I didn't,
[41:32.990 --> 41:35.990]  I didn't use to drive around with a rig on me. I wouldn't take glass with me.
[41:35.990 --> 41:39.030]  I wouldn't do any of that stuff. I didn't like taking a rig with me anywhere.
[41:39.710 --> 41:42.070]  But we would get a bowl burning real hot,
[41:42.110 --> 41:46.430]  just get it super ridiculous chariot and then just drop globs of hash onto it and
[41:46.430 --> 41:49.030]  then try to smoke as much of that as we could. Uh,
[41:49.030 --> 41:52.310]  it would make us choke so hard, but we would get high as shit.
[41:52.790 --> 41:53.710]  It was so much fun.
[41:54.710 --> 41:57.670]  We did so much bizarre shit back in the day.
[41:58.910 --> 42:02.390]  Um, the swing arm skillets where we'd have them glowing like the sun and then
[42:02.390 --> 42:06.070]  throw a quarter gram dab down because we didn't know anything about what we were
[42:06.070 --> 42:07.070]  doing back in the day.
[42:07.070 --> 42:11.230]  And that oil would just fly out onto your legs and shit while you were hitting it
[42:11.470 --> 42:12.950]  boiling temp. Oh my God.
[42:14.430 --> 42:15.870]  Shout out to my buddy, Jordan Segoto.
[42:15.870 --> 42:18.870]  One day we were dabbing and he heated the banger and I don't know what he was
[42:18.870 --> 42:19.150]  thinking.
[42:19.150 --> 42:23.470]  He grabbed a fat dab and like just heats the banger sets the torch down and just
[42:23.470 --> 42:26.110]  puts the dab on the nail. Usually you got to wait a few,
[42:26.350 --> 42:29.510]  at least a few seconds. A lot of these new kids are setting a fucking timer.
[42:29.830 --> 42:33.230]  They got a little fucking hourglass. Come on, come on. You can wait.
[42:33.230 --> 42:36.150]  You know how to figure it out. But anyway, Jordan just goes right in.
[42:36.150 --> 42:36.990]  He just goes in.
[42:37.030 --> 42:40.710]  And I was probably 15 feet away from him sitting in another chair and I could
[42:40.710 --> 42:43.230]  hear the dab scream. The dab went
[42:46.070 --> 42:47.630]  and we could all hear it from across the room.
[42:47.630 --> 42:50.830]  And that dude turned to purple and red and tons of different colors and cough
[42:50.830 --> 42:54.190]  forever. That poor dude took the hottest dab ever. And I'll never forget it.
[42:54.230 --> 42:57.350]  She was terrible. Glowy, glowy.
[42:58.230 --> 43:02.310]  The first generation of dab kits have some of the best little burn and brand
[43:02.310 --> 43:03.150]  marks.
[43:03.750 --> 43:05.750]  Where's your, where's your a dab wound?
[43:05.990 --> 43:11.030]  I've got two drip wounds on one of my legs from the skillet days that you can't
[43:11.050 --> 43:12.150]  really tell what they're like.
[43:12.150 --> 43:16.190]  They're dad related unless you get explained and then the stripe makes sense.
[43:17.310 --> 43:21.270]  Um, but I remember seeing kids like when domeless nails first started being
[43:21.270 --> 43:25.350]  notched a little bit, sort of like castle towers. Yeah. Um,
[43:25.390 --> 43:29.030]  I was in, um, like Walmart or some shit.
[43:29.030 --> 43:33.270]  And a kid reached out with some money and I saw on his forearm that he had that
[43:33.270 --> 43:38.230]  brand mark on his wrist and I was just a fucking busted up laughing. Um,
[43:38.310 --> 43:42.710]  I saw a whole bunch of the circular domeless nail burns. Yeah. Um,
[43:42.750 --> 43:46.190]  back in the dome days, people had all sorts of crazy drip burns.
[43:46.190 --> 43:49.470]  You guys don't let your friends try to carb the dab rig.
[43:49.670 --> 43:52.830]  Just don't pull that hot nail. It's hot. You just heated it with the torch.
[43:53.110 --> 43:56.150]  Don't carve it. Just smoke. It's not a, it's not a bong. You're not smoking pot.
[43:56.150 --> 43:58.830]  It's not going to burn and you're not going to carve it. If you just smoke,
[43:58.870 --> 44:01.310]  it'll quit smoking when it's done. Just do it. You'll be cool.
[44:01.670 --> 44:05.590]  A friend of mine, he was being handed a rig and the person almost dropped it and
[44:05.590 --> 44:10.150]  he reached out reflexively and grabbed it in the heat sinks in the top of the
[44:10.150 --> 44:12.910]  nail lined up in between his thumb and forefinger.
[44:13.390 --> 44:17.470]  And the brand right there looks like half space alien. He,
[44:18.030 --> 44:20.150]  um, just because of the,
[44:20.150 --> 44:23.870]  the way that the bowl pressed into his hand and then the heat sinks below it,
[44:23.910 --> 44:27.630]  the little metal stripes. Sounds terrible. No, it was hideous,
[44:27.630 --> 44:29.030]  but now the brand looks cool.
[44:31.710 --> 44:34.750]  Ouch. There's the plus side. Yeah. All right. Let's, let's,
[44:34.830 --> 44:38.710]  let's go back to a positive note. You guys, man, this place is going everywhere.
[44:38.710 --> 44:41.950]  This is what dads do to the show. Yeah. Shout out to dabs. Uh,
[44:41.990 --> 44:45.430]  the new thing is to take some good shatter or some good hash of any kind and
[44:45.470 --> 44:49.630]  then dunk it into fresh terpenes, either from a brute blue,
[44:50.430 --> 44:52.350]  words are hard at the end of the show, blue river,
[44:52.830 --> 44:55.510]  or of course our friends at Evo labs. That is the thing.
[44:55.550 --> 44:59.030]  I think Duncan the dabs and turps kind of pushes it to a whole new level. Uh,
[44:59.070 --> 45:03.750]  the ghost train, Hayes dabs make my eyes vibrate. Lemon G dabs, uh,
[45:03.790 --> 45:06.710]  make my head spin a little bit. And the OG cush dabs just make me want to lay
[45:06.710 --> 45:09.350]  down and chill the fuck out of the turps, the turps.
[45:09.350 --> 45:11.770]  So these new turps are definitely the next level. You guys,
[45:11.770 --> 45:13.870]  if you have the opportunity, come to Colorado,
[45:14.070 --> 45:17.110]  find a store that sells turps recreationally, get some shatter,
[45:17.110 --> 45:19.870]  get some turps, put a dab, a shatter on a dabber,
[45:19.870 --> 45:21.550]  and dunk it into the container of turps.
[45:21.550 --> 45:25.430]  Put that onto a properly temperatured nail, carb cap it, enjoy the flavor.
[45:25.430 --> 45:27.590]  That shit's amazing. That's what I recommend. Come to Colorado.
[45:27.590 --> 45:29.510]  Say what's up. Come see us. It'd be awesome to see you.
[45:29.870 --> 45:33.150]  We'll take a hike with you. We'll take a dab with you. We're volunteering.
[45:33.510 --> 45:35.630]  Yeah. All right. You guys, we've been going for 45 minutes.
[45:35.630 --> 45:36.830]  A lot of people are getting ADD.
[45:36.830 --> 45:38.790]  The people at the table are super high and they're getting really quiet.
[45:39.030 --> 45:41.910]  So it feels like it's time to wrap up this show. Mike, you look good and high.
[45:41.910 --> 45:44.270]  What were you going to say? I said, I'm thinking about turps now.
[45:44.270 --> 45:47.990]  I was just distracted and now I remember those are over there.
[45:48.070 --> 45:51.430]  It's time for a dunking dab. It's time for a dunking dab nuts.
[45:51.510 --> 45:54.070]  That sounds way worse than it's going to be. Mike,
[45:54.070 --> 45:57.390]  shout out your Twitter handle so that folks can follow you and also remind them
[45:57.390 --> 45:58.350]  of your Facebook page.
[45:58.390 --> 46:03.390]  It's at Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter and Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on
[46:03.670 --> 46:06.590]  Facebook. Lindsey, that's a killer stretch. That's inspiring.
[46:06.590 --> 46:08.470]  You're making me want to stretch and get an inch taller.
[46:09.470 --> 46:10.310]  Yeah.
[46:12.790 --> 46:14.710]  So good. I couldn't even talk after it.
[46:14.710 --> 46:17.110]  I can see it. It was like I had like a stroke almost.
[46:17.350 --> 46:19.630]  Remind everybody how they can follow you on all the social media.
[46:20.550 --> 46:25.110]  I am the traveling stoner on Instagram and Periscope.
[46:25.990 --> 46:30.990]  My Snapchat is traveling stoner without the G and my Twitter is the travel
[46:32.430 --> 46:36.950]  stoner. Oh, and Facebook is the traveling stoner too, I guess.
[46:36.990 --> 46:40.550]  You tell them about your website. Uh, no, cause it's not,
[46:41.110 --> 46:44.470]  don't go there yet. Nah, it's not up and ready yet. So chill out on that.
[46:44.470 --> 46:46.870]  You guys want to be ready? Yeah. I just put her on the spot.
[46:46.870 --> 46:47.830]  Now she's got to make it happen.
[46:48.670 --> 46:50.190]  I want to thank you guys for coming and hanging out on the show.
[46:50.190 --> 46:52.790]  I know it's fucking midnight now. I know everybody has to work in the morning.
[46:52.830 --> 46:55.150]  So shout out to all the people that are out there busting their ass.
[46:55.150 --> 46:57.870]  All the growers, all the bud tenders, everybody that's making this new industry
[46:57.870 --> 47:00.990]  move. Uh, there's no room for some lazy fucks in this one.
[47:00.990 --> 47:03.070]  All the people that are on it now are grinding a hundred percent.
[47:03.070 --> 47:05.950]  So it's time to step up and get it going. Yeah.
[47:07.030 --> 47:09.950]  Everyone just gave me that. Yeah. Look, I,
[47:10.390 --> 47:14.510]  I laugh at the lazy stoner stereotype. Like when you see this industry work,
[47:16.910 --> 47:19.350]  it's such a, yeah, yeah, bro. We, we put it in.
[47:19.390 --> 47:22.070]  Shout out to the people that have been trimming all week at the, at the grow.

[48:31.590 --> 48:34.310]  So I want to thank my friends for joining me once again, until next time,
[48:34.310 --> 48:36.950]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[48:38.750 --> 48:42.350]  About noon. Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon.
[48:42.590 --> 48:47.030]  I got to get drunk before the day begins. Before my mother starts bitching about
[48:47.030 --> 48:47.870]  my friends,
[48:48.110 --> 49:14.740]  about to go and damn near went blind young shit buying W and then I played my
[49:18.580 --> 49:22.860]  old shit. It went something like this cruising down the street in my six,
[49:22.860 --> 49:24.740]  four jockeying the bitches,
[49:24.940 --> 49:29.940]  slapping the hose went to the park to get the school knuckleheads out there.
[49:30.180 --> 49:34.060]  Cold shooting some who can it be?
[49:34.540 --> 49:36.740]  A fresh El Camino rolling kilo G.
[49:38.420 --> 49:42.460]  And he started to say, it's all about making that GTA.
[49:42.500 --> 49:47.220]  Cause the boys in the hood are always hard to come talking that trash will pull
[49:47.220 --> 49:50.460]  your car. No, nothing in life, but to be legit.
[49:50.700 --> 49:53.140]  Don't fool me boy. Cause I ain't said shit.
[49:55.740 --> 50:25.840]  I'm trying to steal a out
[50:27.840 --> 50:28.680]  to call a truce.
[50:29.160 --> 50:31.680]  The silly motherfucker pulls out a deuce deuce.
[50:32.720 --> 50:37.160]  No, I had a loaded 12 gauge one sucker dead LA times front page.
[50:37.160 --> 50:41.920]  Cause the boys in the hood are always hard to come talking that trash will pull
[50:41.920 --> 50:45.120]  your car. No, nothing in life, but to be legit.
[50:45.360 --> 50:47.800]  Don't fool me boy. Cause I ain't said shit.
[51:11.310 --> 51:15.310]  And I want to get ill. So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill.
[51:15.670 --> 51:20.070]  The fellas out there making that dollar. I pulled up in my six,
[51:20.070 --> 51:24.910]  four and I start drinking and from the eight ball,
[51:24.910 --> 51:26.390]  my breath starts sticking.
[51:26.670 --> 51:30.390]  Let me get my girl to rock that body before I left.
[51:30.390 --> 51:34.350]  I hit the book party, went to a house to get her out of the pad.
[51:34.510 --> 51:37.070]  Dumb hole says something that made me mad.
[51:37.430 --> 51:39.830]  She said something that I couldn't believe.
[51:39.870 --> 51:42.310]  So I grabbed a stupid bitch by nappy ass.
[51:42.990 --> 51:46.750]  Started talking shit. Wouldn't you know, reach back like a pimp,
[51:46.830 --> 51:47.830]  slap the hole.
[51:48.390 --> 51:50.790]  My father jumped up and he started to shout.
[51:50.830 --> 51:53.430]  So I threw a white frost and knocked his old ass out.
[51:53.670 --> 51:58.390]  Cause the boys in the hood are always hard to come talking that trash will pull
[51:58.430 --> 52:01.630]  your car. No, I'm nothing in life, but to be legit.
[52:01.830 --> 52:04.310]  Don't fool me boy. Cause I ain't said shit.
[52:36.260 --> 52:40.420]  And go by and I'll see the G right now.
[52:40.460 --> 52:43.460]  Cat is driving kilo on the side as a bus.
[52:43.460 --> 52:47.960]  And a couple of cop in a dark green.
[52:48.680 --> 52:50.840]  Cat got beat for resisting arrest.
[52:50.960 --> 52:53.600]  He sucked a pig in the head for ripping his guests.
[52:53.720 --> 52:57.840]  Now G is cocked for doing the crime for the fence on the boy.
[52:57.840 --> 53:01.600]  He'll do some time. Cause the boys in the hood are always hard.
[53:01.880 --> 53:04.480]  You come talking that trash will pull your car.
[53:04.720 --> 53:07.240]  No, I'm nothing in life, but to be legit.
[53:07.480 --> 53:09.920]  Don't fool me boy. Cause I ain't said shit.
[53:10.520 --> 53:11.040]  Yeah.
[53:36.190 --> 53:38.870]  In the county jail, two days later,
[53:38.870 --> 53:41.670]  in municipal court, he will be on trial.
[53:41.670 --> 53:47.100]  Cold cut off on the six year sentence.
[53:47.100 --> 53:48.540]  My man didn't budge.
[53:48.780 --> 53:50.940]  Better came over to turn him in.
[53:51.180 --> 53:56.740]  He will then can sue me.
[53:56.820 --> 53:59.020]  The bitch came in with a submachine.
[53:59.580 --> 54:01.860]  Only shot the bitch, but didn't hurt her.
[54:02.420 --> 54:04.820]  Both stayed for attempted murder.
[54:04.860 --> 54:07.220]  Cause the boys in the hood are always hard.
[54:07.500 --> 54:10.140]  You come talking that trash will pull your car.
[54:10.300 --> 54:12.860]  No, I'm nothing in life, but to be legit.
[54:13.060 --> 54:15.620]  Don't fool me boy. Cause I ain't said shit.
[54:19.780 --> 54:20.060]  Yeah.
[54:25.060 --> 54:25.380]  Busy.
