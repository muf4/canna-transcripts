[00:51.660 --> 00:56.060]  It has become a tradition that I start this podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:56.060 --> 01:01.000]  I just took a dab of Copper Chem Full Spectrum Extract that made me go sit down on the couch
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.680]  for 5 or 10 minutes and try to get my life together before I could do a podcast.
[01:05.680 --> 01:10.700]  The Copper Chem Full Spectrum Extract is a blend of Chem 4 and Stardog, two of my favorite
[01:10.700 --> 01:12.220]  strains individually.
[01:12.220 --> 01:15.140]  They were bred together to make a beautiful strain.
[01:15.140 --> 01:16.520]  This stuff tastes delicious.
[01:16.520 --> 01:20.600]  On the package, the flavor is described as guava juice and watermelon.
[01:20.600 --> 01:22.280]  I think I will agree with that.
[01:22.280 --> 01:24.800]  Plus, a little bit of foot-fuel-y funk.
[01:24.800 --> 01:27.680]  There is something funky in there that I really enjoy.
[01:27.680 --> 01:32.820]  Big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Copper Chem Full Spectrum
[01:32.820 --> 01:33.820]  Extract.
[01:33.820 --> 01:35.720]  All right, podcast world.
[01:35.720 --> 01:38.780]  This is going to be a listener email episode.
[01:38.780 --> 01:44.240]  Before I get to the email, let's do a few shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[01:44.240 --> 01:47.600]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out thank you to my friend

[03:19.300 --> 03:22.780]  The email I've got in my hand goes just like this.
[03:22.780 --> 03:25.700]  It starts off with feel free to use my name.
[03:25.700 --> 03:27.580]  This one comes from my new friend, David.
[03:27.580 --> 03:28.580]  What's up, David?
[03:28.580 --> 03:29.780]  Thank you for the wonderful email.
[03:29.780 --> 03:31.740]  The message goes like this.
[03:31.740 --> 03:37.220]  I have recently received a six by six tent with two 600 watt closed hood lights with
[03:37.220 --> 03:40.460]  dimmable metal halide HPS ballasts.
[03:40.460 --> 03:41.740]  So far, we're off to a good start.
[03:41.740 --> 03:44.500]  We got 1200 watts and a six by six.
[03:44.500 --> 03:46.520]  It's going to be a little bit more than enough.
[03:46.740 --> 03:48.040]  So I think this will work well.
[03:48.040 --> 03:53.640]  The tent is six by six and has two six inch fans to clip on the poles and two six inch
[03:53.640 --> 03:56.200]  inline fans and a carbon filter.
[03:56.200 --> 03:57.240]  That is a great setup.
[03:57.240 --> 03:59.320]  I know exactly what to do with this.
[03:59.320 --> 04:00.320]  I can get you going.
[04:00.320 --> 04:05.440]  It says, it has been a while since I've ran HPS as I flower with LEDs now, and I only
[04:05.440 --> 04:08.520]  veg under metal halides and HPS.
[04:08.520 --> 04:11.320]  I would like to use this new setup as a second flower room.
[04:11.320 --> 04:12.480]  All right, that makes sense.
[04:12.480 --> 04:14.120]  There's a few things we can skip here in this.
[04:14.120 --> 04:15.920]  We don't need to read all of this.
[04:15.920 --> 04:17.160]  Here's the part we need to focus on.
[04:17.160 --> 04:22.000]  It says, however, I was wondering mostly how to set everything up inside the tent as to
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.040]  not have it collapse under the weight of the equipment.
[04:25.040 --> 04:29.000]  And if the ballast should be outside of the tent for heat issues.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.480]  Also best practices for venting the filter through hoods, then out of the room.
[04:33.480 --> 04:38.320]  If I should have the fan outside of the tent or inside, because again, weight issues are
[04:38.320 --> 04:39.320]  real.
[04:39.320 --> 04:42.480]  I do appreciate all of the love, good vibes and knowledge you spread.
[04:42.480 --> 04:43.480]  Then they signed it.
[04:43.480 --> 04:45.760]  Respect Rasta from David.
[04:45.760 --> 04:47.600]  Hey David, this is a great email.
[04:47.600 --> 04:50.520]  I started off my grow career in tents.
[04:50.520 --> 04:53.840]  Well, when I got serious about growing, I started buying tents.
[04:53.840 --> 04:56.960]  Before we all had those little rooms that you just kind of hung up a light and wished
[04:56.960 --> 04:57.960]  for the best.
[04:57.960 --> 05:02.520]  When I really thought I'm going to make this happen, one of my first investments was a
[05:02.520 --> 05:03.520]  tent.
[05:03.520 --> 05:08.560]  And then I got really good at growing in tents and I set up a bunch of tents for myself and
[05:08.560 --> 05:10.520]  friends all over this town.
[05:10.520 --> 05:14.520]  We were all growing in nice five by five and four by eight tents all over.
[05:14.520 --> 05:16.560]  I've got a lot of experience in this.
[05:16.560 --> 05:18.960]  Let's talk a little bit about setting up your tent.
[05:18.960 --> 05:22.720]  I like that you included the equipment list that makes it very easy for me.
[05:22.720 --> 05:24.960]  I know that I'm working with a six by six tent.
[05:24.960 --> 05:27.200]  I know that I've got two 600 watt lights.
[05:27.200 --> 05:29.040]  I know we've got two blowers.
[05:29.040 --> 05:30.400]  We've probably got some ducting.
[05:30.400 --> 05:33.560]  We've got a couple of fans, which are just small accessories to deal with.
[05:33.560 --> 05:35.440]  It sounds like we've got a nice setup.
[05:35.440 --> 05:41.240]  The main thing I would start thinking about is can the room in which you intend to set
[05:41.240 --> 05:48.480]  this tent up provide enough electricity to run two 600 watt lights and all of the accessories
[05:48.480 --> 05:49.480]  safely?
[05:49.480 --> 05:51.920]  I don't know what kind of ballast you're using.
[05:51.920 --> 05:53.080]  I don't know if they're magnetic.
[05:53.080 --> 05:54.360]  I don't know if they're digital.
[05:54.360 --> 05:56.080]  I don't know what else is in the room.
[05:56.080 --> 05:57.600]  I don't know if this is in a house.
[05:57.600 --> 05:59.400]  I don't know if this is in a warehouse.
[05:59.400 --> 06:02.800]  I don't know if this is in a really old house or a modern house.
[06:02.800 --> 06:06.920]  I would start by doing a safety inspection on my electricity.
[06:06.920 --> 06:11.560]  I would make sure that the plug-ins in the wall are up to today's modern standards.
[06:11.560 --> 06:15.600]  I would make sure that all of the wiring is up to today's modern standards.
[06:15.600 --> 06:19.840]  I would make sure that the breaker box and all of the breakers are up to code and up
[06:19.840 --> 06:22.680]  to today's modern standards.
[06:22.680 --> 06:28.640]  Many old houses will have old sockets, old plug-ins, old wiring, and old breakers.
[06:28.640 --> 06:33.160]  Those old houses will probably handle a 600 with no problem.
[06:33.160 --> 06:39.720]  Those old houses may not be able to run two 600-watt lights in one room from the same
[06:39.720 --> 06:40.720]  breaker.
[06:40.720 --> 06:44.600]  You may need to do some electrical modification or some electrical adjustments.
[06:44.600 --> 06:48.520]  If you do that, make sure it is done by somebody who is qualified.
[06:48.520 --> 06:52.320]  Please don't burn down your house in the name of growing ganja.
[06:52.320 --> 06:54.280]  Please don't do that to the movement.
[06:54.280 --> 06:57.720]  Please don't do that to the whole cannabis legalization scene.
[06:57.720 --> 07:01.880]  Now, I know sometimes I get excessive when it comes to talking about safety and things,
[07:01.880 --> 07:04.880]  but I really don't want you to burn down your house.
[07:04.880 --> 07:06.160]  I don't want you to burn down the house.
[07:06.160 --> 07:07.320]  I don't want you to hurt yourself.
[07:07.320 --> 07:09.140]  I don't want you to hurt anybody else.
[07:09.140 --> 07:11.520]  We have to be responsible cannabis growers.
[07:11.520 --> 07:13.160]  We have to be responsible people.
[07:13.160 --> 07:16.280]  I have to be a responsible educator and podcaster.
[07:16.280 --> 07:20.580]  So my first piece of advice is to make sure that the place in which you intend to plug
[07:20.580 --> 07:25.720]  in these two 600-watt ballasts can handle that much electricity safely.
[07:25.720 --> 07:29.600]  600 watts of light in that six-by-six tent will be sufficient.
[07:29.600 --> 07:32.000]  1200 would be really cool.
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.080]  600 will get you by and your plants will be happy.
[07:35.080 --> 07:40.480]  I would much rather see you run one 600-watt light and not burn down the house than try
[07:40.480 --> 07:44.160]  to push two 600s and possibly burn down an old house.
[07:44.160 --> 07:47.680]  All right, I will move forward and I'll quit talking about the safety part because you've
[07:47.680 --> 07:48.680]  heard it.
[07:48.680 --> 07:51.900]  You're going to either heed my advice or you're going to do your own thing and you've got
[07:51.900 --> 07:55.240]  freedom to do whatever you want because America and you're an adult.
[07:55.240 --> 07:56.640]  So let's move forward.
[07:56.640 --> 07:59.480]  You do raise a really good question with this email.
[07:59.520 --> 08:04.960]  When they sell us those tents and they recommend where to install everything, it is a real
[08:04.960 --> 08:10.120]  prayer hoping that everything stays where you put it without that flimsy aluminum tubing
[08:10.120 --> 08:11.920]  just collapsing on you.
[08:11.920 --> 08:15.680]  It's even more stressful once you've got plants that are growing in there.
[08:15.680 --> 08:16.840]  Every day it just gets more stressful.
[08:16.840 --> 08:21.560]  You're like, oh, if this thing falls over now, I've crushed 10 weeks worth of work.
[08:21.560 --> 08:22.800]  So it does become stressful.
[08:22.800 --> 08:23.920]  I understand.
[08:23.920 --> 08:28.120]  I don't like to hang too many things from the tent.
[08:28.120 --> 08:31.520]  They give you those two or four poles that go across the ceiling that you're supposed
[08:31.520 --> 08:33.200]  to be able to mount your shit to.
[08:33.200 --> 08:35.620]  I don't trust that very much.
[08:35.620 --> 08:39.680]  So I do agree with you that it can be very stressful trying to mount everything in a
[08:39.680 --> 08:42.040]  tent sufficiently and efficiently.
[08:42.040 --> 08:43.880]  So let's talk about a few options.
[08:43.880 --> 08:46.020]  You've got two vented hoods.
[08:46.020 --> 08:51.920]  You have also got two six inch inline blowers, but you have only got one carbon filter.
[08:51.920 --> 08:56.540]  So I do have a very good setup idea for this tent.
[08:56.540 --> 09:01.320]  This will work if you choose to run one or two of those vented hoods.
[09:01.320 --> 09:05.760]  Now I have completely agreed with you that it is sketchy hanging a lot of items, a lot
[09:05.760 --> 09:08.100]  of equipment from the top of that grow tent.
[09:08.100 --> 09:12.620]  So in this setup, we are only going to hang the one or two grow lights, whichever you
[09:12.620 --> 09:13.620]  choose to do.
[09:13.620 --> 09:16.780]  And if you're listening out there and you're setting up a tent, this will work beautifully
[09:16.780 --> 09:19.340]  for you with one or two grow lights.
[09:19.340 --> 09:23.140]  I'm going to kind of focus the lesson on one light, and then I'll just briefly talk about
[09:23.140 --> 09:24.420]  where to add the second light.
[09:24.420 --> 09:27.420]  It's basically just a piece of ducting and you continue the chain.
[09:27.420 --> 09:31.820]  But this is exactly how I set up my tents in a small room.
[09:31.820 --> 09:35.980]  If I have got a couple of blowers and a carbon filter and ducted lights.
[09:35.980 --> 09:40.540]  If you've only got one blower, we will talk about a different option for that a little
[09:40.540 --> 09:41.840]  further in the lesson.
[09:41.840 --> 09:46.680]  This setup is going to focus on two six inch blowers, a vented light.
[09:46.680 --> 09:49.420]  And when I say a vented light, let me talk about that for a moment.
[09:49.420 --> 09:54.280]  I'm talking about a grow light that's got an input for a duct on one side and an output
[09:54.340 --> 09:55.760]  for a duct on the other.
[09:55.760 --> 09:58.960]  And then underneath where the bulb goes, there's a piece of glass in there.
[09:58.960 --> 10:03.440]  So your bulb is basically kept inside of a box, which is sealed with that piece of glass
[10:03.440 --> 10:06.300]  that allows the light to illuminate down.
[10:06.300 --> 10:10.980]  But then the heat is moved away from that light, away from the grow area by using the
[10:10.980 --> 10:15.240]  blowers, which we were talking about, the six inch inline fans that hooks up to ducting.
[10:15.240 --> 10:17.520]  You turn that blower on, it blows air through there.
[10:17.520 --> 10:21.380]  Then the heat from that light bulb gets removed from your grow environment.
[10:21.380 --> 10:23.880]  It is much easier to cool the room.
[10:23.880 --> 10:29.000]  The downside to that is you lose a small percentage of your light power because of
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.640]  that glass between the bulb and the canopy.
[10:31.640 --> 10:35.120]  And you've also got to make sure to keep that glass clean.
[10:35.120 --> 10:38.680]  But in some environments, this is an ideal setup in a tent.
[10:38.680 --> 10:40.160]  It will work beautifully.
[10:40.160 --> 10:41.800]  That's exactly what I do.
[10:41.800 --> 10:45.960]  But we've got the two blowers, we've got the two vented lights, we've got the carbon filter,
[10:45.960 --> 10:47.680]  we've got the two clip on fans.
[10:47.680 --> 10:52.040]  And I was agreeing that I don't want to hang too many items, too many heavy units from
[10:52.200 --> 10:54.440]  that top bar of the tent.
[10:54.440 --> 10:55.440]  It is sketchy.
[10:55.440 --> 11:00.400]  So in a perfect world, we would mount that carbon filter and blower at the very top dead
[11:00.400 --> 11:01.780]  center of the tent.
[11:01.780 --> 11:05.220]  But we don't have that option because I don't trust the tents.
[11:05.220 --> 11:09.480]  In a tent environment, I'm going to recommend that we set the carbon filter in one of the
[11:09.480 --> 11:14.560]  back corners off of the floor on either a cinder block or some sort of a crate or something
[11:14.560 --> 11:17.480]  like that, just to lift it up off the ground just a little bit.
[11:17.480 --> 11:21.000]  Now I know you're already thinking that's going to take up some of the real estate in
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.800]  your tent, but it is worth every inch of space that it takes up.
[11:25.800 --> 11:30.360]  We need to make sure the air leaving our grow environment does not get us in trouble.
[11:30.360 --> 11:31.900]  So I think it's worth it.
[11:31.900 --> 11:34.640]  And a carbon filter really doesn't take up that much space.
[11:34.640 --> 11:36.000]  Just push it into the corner.
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.400]  You've got it crammed into the corner.
[11:37.400 --> 11:38.580]  It's doing its job.
[11:38.580 --> 11:42.480]  It's sucking all the humidity, all the stale air right out of that tent, blowing it out
[11:42.480 --> 11:45.360]  of the room, and it's not snitching on you while it does it.
[11:45.360 --> 11:47.040]  So just put it in the corner.
[11:47.040 --> 11:49.640]  I like to set it on a cinder block or on a crate.
[11:49.640 --> 11:51.920]  I just like to get it up off the ground.
[11:51.920 --> 11:55.880]  If you can make some sort of a stand or something for it and get it higher and higher up off
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.000]  the ground, that is better, but I don't like to hang it.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.920]  You're absolutely correct in the idea of not wanting to hang that heavy carbon filter and
[12:03.920 --> 12:05.800]  blower from the ceiling of that grow.
[12:05.800 --> 12:11.320]  So get a cinder block, maybe two cinder blocks, set them in the back left corner of the grow,
[12:11.320 --> 12:12.840]  maybe the back right corner of the grow.
[12:12.840 --> 12:15.360]  I'm not sure where the exit duct is on the top of your tent.
[12:15.360 --> 12:19.520]  I don't know which brand you bought, but put that carbon filter right in the very back
[12:19.520 --> 12:20.520]  corner.
[12:20.520 --> 12:24.000]  Then set the blower directly on top of the carbon filter.
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.900]  Now you're off to a really good start.
[12:25.900 --> 12:29.280]  Now we are almost done with setting up the carbon filter and that blower.
[12:29.280 --> 12:33.600]  The next step is to run ducting from the blower out of the tent.
[12:33.600 --> 12:35.720]  Just go through that exit hole at the very top.
[12:35.720 --> 12:38.400]  Most of them have a six inch hole right at the ceiling.
[12:38.400 --> 12:40.220]  Go right out of that hole.
[12:40.220 --> 12:44.660]  Then continue that ducting and run it wherever you need to, to efficiently get that air away
[12:44.660 --> 12:46.240]  from your grow tent.
[12:46.240 --> 12:49.640]  Keep in mind that heat rises, so keep that duct up high.
[12:49.640 --> 12:52.880]  You'll be dispersing the hot air up high wherever it goes.
[12:52.880 --> 12:54.720]  You may be able to keep it in the same room.
[12:54.720 --> 12:59.440]  You'll keep that hot air up high and the tent will bring in the fresh air through the passive
[12:59.440 --> 13:02.880]  vents at the bottom and you'll get that fresh cool air on the bottom.
[13:02.880 --> 13:08.120]  If I set up a tent in my spare bedroom in my house, my normal air in my house will keep
[13:08.120 --> 13:10.760]  that tent cool if I vent it properly.
[13:10.760 --> 13:15.000]  If I point the end of that ducting right out of that room and it's blowing that heat into
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.880]  the rest of the house to where it could just be dispersed into the house and circulate
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.520]  and cycle and become part of the regular atmosphere of the house, the central air will cool that
[13:23.520 --> 13:28.240]  air and the central air also blows fresh air into that bedroom where I've got that grow
[13:28.240 --> 13:29.240]  tent.
[13:29.240 --> 13:33.200]  With a little bit of thinking and proper circulation, I can keep the house and the grow room very
[13:33.200 --> 13:38.820]  comfortable without any extra strain on my HVAC system or without any weird adjustments
[13:38.820 --> 13:41.320]  to my daily life in my house.
[13:41.320 --> 13:45.840]  If you've got two blowers and a carbon filter, it is really easy to put the carbon filter
[13:45.840 --> 13:47.160]  on some sort of a shelf.
[13:47.160 --> 13:50.320]  Just get it up off the ground, put it in the back corner of the tent.
[13:50.320 --> 13:54.160]  Then you've got carbon filter, put the blower on there, put a piece of duct tape between
[13:54.160 --> 13:59.000]  them so you make a nice seal, put ducting on there, put plenty of duct tape on there,
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.120]  a nice seal on that so you don't get any air leakage, then run that ducting wherever you
[14:03.120 --> 14:06.480]  need it to get it away from that tent or away from that room.
[14:06.480 --> 14:10.680]  Now at this point, all of the air leaving your grow tent should be passing through that
[14:10.680 --> 14:14.480]  carbon filter and should be odor free and you should be safe.
[14:14.480 --> 14:17.400]  Now let's talk about how to set up the grow lights.
[14:17.400 --> 14:21.440]  Our main option for hanging the grow lights is to use those provided bars and hang them
[14:21.440 --> 14:23.840]  from the ceiling just like recommended.
[14:23.840 --> 14:25.080]  I would do that.
[14:25.080 --> 14:30.160]  I don't like to hang much more than a grow light from that top bar, but let's go ahead
[14:30.160 --> 14:32.840]  and hang the grow lights from the top as recommended.
[14:32.840 --> 14:38.760]  I like to use some sort of height adjustable light hanger, something like a yo-yo or whatever
[14:38.760 --> 14:42.840]  is available at your local grow store because I like to be able to adjust that light very
[14:42.840 --> 14:48.400]  easily without any stress on my body and without risking causing any problems in the grow.
[14:48.400 --> 14:52.480]  So I recommend one of those ratchet style light mover hangers.
[14:52.480 --> 14:54.820]  Those will make your life much easier.
[14:54.820 --> 14:59.800]  So hang the light, install the bulb, don't leave any fingerprints or hand marks on the
[14:59.800 --> 15:00.800]  bulb.
[15:00.800 --> 15:05.320]  When you are screwing the bulb into your reflector, I recommend wearing a rubber glove or even
[15:05.320 --> 15:08.960]  one of those felty gloves so that you don't leave any marks on the bulb.
[15:08.960 --> 15:13.760]  Then when you are done, I also recommend wiping that bulb off with a paper towel or something.
[15:13.760 --> 15:15.600]  Please don't leave any fingerprints on it.
[15:15.600 --> 15:18.280]  That's not good for your bulb and it's very easy to prevent.
[15:18.280 --> 15:20.000]  So let's clean off the bulb.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.760]  You are potentially going to hang two lights in this grow, so let's hang both of them up
[15:24.760 --> 15:26.600]  if that is what you choose to do.
[15:26.600 --> 15:28.800]  So now we've got two lights hanging.
[15:28.800 --> 15:31.520]  We don't have any ducting on there, but we've got the bulbs in.
[15:31.520 --> 15:35.300]  Now it is time to install that ducting.
[15:35.300 --> 15:39.400]  Now is the time to think about which direction you need to move the air.
[15:39.400 --> 15:40.840]  Where does that air need to go?
[15:40.840 --> 15:42.500]  How are you getting it out of that room?
[15:42.500 --> 15:44.520]  Where does it go once it leaves the tent?
[15:44.520 --> 15:49.200]  I would run that duct to where your goal destination for that air is.
[15:49.200 --> 15:52.600]  Are you going to dump it right by the doorway so that it can cycle out of that room into
[15:52.600 --> 15:53.660]  the other room?
[15:53.660 --> 15:57.160]  Are you going to run it just to the opposite side of the room, far away from the tent and
[15:57.160 --> 15:58.240]  hope that it works that way?
[15:58.240 --> 16:01.540]  It possibly will, but now is the time to think about that.
[16:01.540 --> 16:04.720]  Put that ducting there, then run it to your tent.
[16:04.720 --> 16:08.660]  And at the tops of the tents, there is an in and an out on each side.
[16:08.660 --> 16:09.820]  They don't come from the ceiling.
[16:09.820 --> 16:12.300]  They're toward the top of the tent on the sides.
[16:12.300 --> 16:16.420]  Most tents have these ducts in and out for this exact purpose.
[16:16.420 --> 16:21.220]  We're going to run a length of ducting in one side of the tent, and we will attach that
[16:21.220 --> 16:23.020]  to one of your grow lights.
[16:23.020 --> 16:27.960]  I recommend a piece of duct tape, and I also recommend a hose clamp around that.
[16:27.960 --> 16:33.580]  Then we're going to run another piece of ducting from the other side of that light to the other
[16:33.580 --> 16:34.580]  light.
[16:34.640 --> 16:35.920]  Make a nice little bend.
[16:35.920 --> 16:37.840]  Don't make a nice sharp angle.
[16:37.840 --> 16:38.840]  Make kind of a curve.
[16:38.840 --> 16:40.600]  The more of a curve you can make, the better.
[16:40.600 --> 16:46.120]  You don't want a super sharp angle that lessens the efficiency of your blower.
[16:46.120 --> 16:51.040]  We want a nice curve, and we need to attach that ducting securely to our second light.
[16:51.040 --> 16:56.720]  You've got ducting running from essentially your exit point into the tent, attached to
[16:56.720 --> 16:58.000]  the first light.
[16:58.000 --> 17:02.320]  Then off of the other side of that light, you've got ducting attaching that to the next
[17:02.320 --> 17:03.320]  light.
[17:03.320 --> 17:08.420]  The obvious next step in this chain is to run ducting off of light number two and out
[17:08.420 --> 17:10.860]  of that vent on the other side of the tent.
[17:10.860 --> 17:15.940]  Whichever side you went in, there was another exit port on the other side of the tent.
[17:15.940 --> 17:17.440]  Run it right through there.
[17:17.440 --> 17:22.700]  We have now created a tunnel that goes in one side of the tent, over light number one,
[17:22.700 --> 17:25.880]  over light number two, and out of the tent.
[17:25.880 --> 17:31.220]  Essentially the air that travels through that tunnel never makes it into your grow environment.
[17:31.320 --> 17:34.240]  Now how do we move that heat and that air away from the lights?
[17:34.240 --> 17:38.280]  We use that second six inch blower that we spoke of earlier.
[17:38.280 --> 17:43.880]  You can attach your second six inch inline fan to that ducting outside of the tent, and
[17:43.880 --> 17:48.960]  you can either hang that six inch inline fan from the ceiling, or you can set it on a cinder
[17:48.960 --> 17:50.400]  block on the floor.
[17:50.400 --> 17:55.640]  The main point of that fan is to blow air through the ducting, over the lights, and
[17:55.640 --> 17:57.240]  out of the other side.
[17:57.240 --> 18:02.700]  All you were doing is moving that heat away from the grow tent and away from the lights.
[18:02.700 --> 18:07.460]  You don't have to worry about that air being filtered because that air never comes in contact
[18:07.460 --> 18:08.700]  with your grow space.
[18:08.700 --> 18:12.760]  It's just simply blowing through a tube that goes right through the room.
[18:12.760 --> 18:16.500]  It's kind of a little subway tunnel that just runs right through the city of your grow.
[18:16.500 --> 18:18.780]  It doesn't interact with the grow in any way.
[18:18.780 --> 18:20.600]  It's its own little air chain.
[18:20.600 --> 18:25.100]  Now you will need to run that end ducting to your exit point, wherever you need to get
[18:25.200 --> 18:27.700]  rid of that heat, wherever you're running that other duct.
[18:27.700 --> 18:32.360]  I would recommend running them right to the same point and get that stale, stagnant air
[18:32.360 --> 18:36.560]  and that grow light heat right away from your grow tent as far as you can.
[18:36.560 --> 18:40.360]  So that sounded too simple in my mind when I said it, so I'm going to recap to make sure
[18:40.360 --> 18:41.800]  we got it correct.
[18:41.800 --> 18:47.080]  The first blower and carbon filter will simply set on the floor or on a shelf in the back
[18:47.080 --> 18:48.760]  corner of the grow tent.
[18:48.760 --> 18:52.240]  You've got the carbon filter, you've got the blower on top of that pointing to where it
[18:52.240 --> 18:56.100]  is sucking the air through the filter and up to the ducting.
[18:56.100 --> 19:00.580]  You run that ducting out of the ceiling of the grow tent and now your filtered air, your
[19:00.580 --> 19:05.540]  stale humid air is leaving that grow tent and now you run that ducting wherever that
[19:05.540 --> 19:07.180]  needs to go.
[19:07.180 --> 19:11.820]  That carbon filter and that blower creating that suction will result in fresh air coming
[19:11.820 --> 19:15.140]  in through the passive vents in the bottom of your grow tent.
[19:15.140 --> 19:19.980]  So now we are getting rid of stale air, we're getting rid of humidity and we're also replacing
[19:20.000 --> 19:26.480]  that with fresh air and the aroma of cannabis is not escaping the tent if we zip it up appropriately.
[19:26.480 --> 19:29.600]  Now we have installed the two lights, they're hanging in the middle of the tent.
[19:29.600 --> 19:34.520]  We've run ducting into the tent to the first light, out of the end of the second light
[19:34.520 --> 19:39.740]  into the end of light number two, then out of light number two we have ran ducting going
[19:39.740 --> 19:45.520]  all the way out of the tent, all the way to our second six inch inline fan.
[19:45.520 --> 19:50.440]  You can set that six inch inline fan to push or pull that air over the lights, whichever
[19:50.440 --> 19:51.440]  way you prefer.
[19:51.440 --> 19:57.160]  I do not have any science to back it up, but in my experience, I think that those blowers,
[19:57.160 --> 20:02.480]  those inline fans are more efficient at pulling air than they are pushing air.
[20:02.480 --> 20:06.340]  They've got more suction power than blowing power in my opinion.
[20:06.340 --> 20:10.200]  So simply run that ducting through the tent, through the lights and right back out of the
[20:10.200 --> 20:11.200]  tent.
[20:11.200 --> 20:14.200]  Make sure that it is sealed at every opportunity for air to leak.
[20:14.200 --> 20:15.720]  You need to seal that up.
[20:15.720 --> 20:17.680]  Make sure you seal everything.
[20:17.680 --> 20:23.200]  If you have got your blower pulling air across those lights and it is sucking air this way,
[20:23.200 --> 20:27.920]  you have got the opportunity to suck aroma up through the lights and then out of that
[20:27.920 --> 20:31.120]  ducting if it is not sealed appropriately.
[20:31.120 --> 20:33.360]  So make sure you seal everything.
[20:33.360 --> 20:37.600]  And even though it's more efficient to suck the air, you may want to push it because that
[20:37.600 --> 20:42.320]  way you're pushing air and if you have any leaks, the leaky air will leak into your grow
[20:42.440 --> 20:46.440]  tent and you won't be pushing odoriferous air out of the environment.
[20:46.440 --> 20:48.560]  So that may be a safety factor.
[20:48.560 --> 20:51.240]  If you don't seal it up all the way, push the air.
[20:51.240 --> 20:55.120]  That way the aroma gets left into the tent and it doesn't sneak out.
[20:55.120 --> 20:56.320]  I hope that makes sense.
[20:56.320 --> 20:57.320]  Think of it this way.
[20:57.320 --> 21:01.700]  If you've got a blower and then you've got some other things with gaps in there and you
[21:01.700 --> 21:04.000]  are sucking, you can pull air through the gaps.
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.960]  And since we're not putting a filter on this blower, we can't pull any air through our
[21:07.960 --> 21:11.840]  gaps because that air will have cannabis aroma through it.
[21:11.860 --> 21:17.040]  So if we're sucking, we've got the opportunity to pull unfiltered air from the grow tent
[21:17.040 --> 21:18.940]  and expel that into the environment.
[21:18.940 --> 21:23.880]  If we are pushing any leaks, you'll actually be pushing the fresh air from outside of the
[21:23.880 --> 21:28.080]  grow into your grow tent and you may get some of that heat from the grow light, but you
[21:28.080 --> 21:33.240]  won't be blasting cannabis scented air out for everybody in the neighborhood to smell.
[21:33.240 --> 21:37.960]  So think about the chain of airflow and make sure that everything is sealed so that you
[21:37.960 --> 21:39.880]  don't get any aroma leaks.
[21:39.880 --> 21:42.400]  You can't see it, so you can't see if it's happening.
[21:42.400 --> 21:46.160]  And you've been around those plants so often that you probably don't smell it.
[21:46.160 --> 21:51.000]  So be very careful and seal it up so that nobody else gets the opportunity to smell
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.000]  that grow.
[21:52.000 --> 21:57.000]  I say it a lot, and this is a good opportunity to remember to set yourself up for success.
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.840]  Now let's talk about the same setup, but with just one blower.
[22:01.840 --> 22:03.280]  Maybe you don't have two blowers.
[22:03.280 --> 22:04.500]  Maybe it doesn't fit the budget.
[22:04.500 --> 22:07.020]  Maybe you didn't score two blowers in your deal.
[22:07.340 --> 22:11.780]  Let's do the same setup, but with only one six inch inline fan.
[22:11.780 --> 22:15.900]  We're going to start off with the very same theory with the carbon filter.
[22:15.900 --> 22:18.740]  We don't want to hang that heavy filter from the ceiling.
[22:18.740 --> 22:19.820]  We don't want to break our plants.
[22:19.820 --> 22:21.100]  We don't want to break the tent.
[22:21.100 --> 22:25.260]  So let's put the carbon filter on a couple of cinder blocks or on a couple of milk crates
[22:25.260 --> 22:27.220]  on the floor in the grow tent.
[22:27.220 --> 22:31.080]  It does take up a little bit of space, but not enough to make me complain.
[22:31.080 --> 22:33.900]  It is very well worth the space in my opinion.
[22:33.900 --> 22:37.140]  Now we've got the carbon filter set on our makeshift shelf.
[22:37.140 --> 22:39.020]  I don't know if you're using a cinder block.
[22:39.020 --> 22:40.860]  I don't know if you've built an actual shelf.
[22:40.860 --> 22:42.340]  Maybe you went and bought a fancy table.
[22:42.340 --> 22:45.060]  I don't know what you're doing, but we've got the carbon filter.
[22:45.060 --> 22:48.380]  Now we've got the blower sitting on top of the carbon filter.
[22:48.380 --> 22:50.940]  Put a ring of tape around that to seal that.
[22:50.940 --> 22:56.300]  Make sure you have got the blower pointed the right direction so the air is being sucked
[22:56.300 --> 22:58.940]  through the carbon filter, then out of the blower.
[22:58.940 --> 23:02.400]  Then we are going to attach ducting to that blower.
[23:02.400 --> 23:06.320]  That ducting is going to run directly to our lights.
[23:06.320 --> 23:09.080]  If you've got two lights, it should be fairly obvious.
[23:09.080 --> 23:13.960]  You go carbon filter, blower, ducting into light number one.
[23:13.960 --> 23:17.420]  You will come out of light number one into light number two.
[23:17.420 --> 23:19.740]  You will come out of light number two.
[23:19.740 --> 23:23.760]  Then you will take ducting and you can either run it out of the top like the chimney or
[23:23.760 --> 23:27.280]  you can run it out of one of those top side vents.
[23:27.280 --> 23:28.280]  That is up to you.
[23:28.280 --> 23:31.960]  Whatever works best for your setup, whatever makes you comfortable, whatever looks best,
[23:32.520 --> 23:35.040]  whatever is most aesthetically pleasing, go ahead and do that.
[23:35.040 --> 23:39.600]  As long as that ducting is running out of your grow tent and it extends away from the
[23:39.600 --> 23:44.720]  tent to get that light heat and also the humidity and stale air away from your tent, it will
[23:44.720 --> 23:45.720]  work beautifully.
[23:45.720 --> 23:50.020]  I run that ducting right to the edge of that room, right to the door and point it right
[23:50.020 --> 23:51.020]  at the door.
[23:51.020 --> 23:54.180]  As you walk in, you get a little blast of warm air on your forehead, but then it goes
[23:54.180 --> 23:55.560]  away immediately.
[23:55.560 --> 23:59.200]  Once you're in the room, you don't notice that there is heat or humidity in there because
[23:59.200 --> 24:02.800]  I've removed it with that six inch inline fan.
[24:02.800 --> 24:09.040]  So that is a very affordable and very efficient way to duct and cool your grow tent all in
[24:09.040 --> 24:10.400]  one move.
[24:10.400 --> 24:11.440]  And I'll repeat it for you.
[24:11.440 --> 24:14.560]  I'm doing carbon filter, then the blower.
[24:14.560 --> 24:19.160]  The blower is sucking the air through the filter and pushing it through the duct.
[24:19.160 --> 24:22.440]  Then that air goes through light number one.
[24:22.440 --> 24:25.240]  If you've got light number two, it goes through light number two.
[24:25.240 --> 24:27.360]  If you don't have light number two, skip it.
[24:27.360 --> 24:28.480]  It's that easy.
[24:28.480 --> 24:32.120]  Just don't add the second light and the second piece of ducting.
[24:32.120 --> 24:34.020]  That should be really obvious for you.
[24:34.020 --> 24:36.040]  Then we come out of light number two.
[24:36.040 --> 24:40.280]  All we've got to do now is run ducting to wherever we want that air to end up.
[24:40.280 --> 24:42.360]  Where's the final destination of that air?
[24:42.360 --> 24:43.360]  Where do we want to dump it?
[24:43.360 --> 24:45.840]  Do you want to run it to the top corner of that bedroom?
[24:45.840 --> 24:47.560]  Do you want to run it out of the bedroom?
[24:47.560 --> 24:50.540]  Are you able to cut a hole in the wall and run it right into the attic?
[24:50.540 --> 24:55.040]  It is safe to dump that air wherever you need because it will not smell like cannabis because
[24:55.040 --> 24:57.360]  it has gone through your carbon filter.
[24:57.760 --> 24:59.160]  Again, be careful.
[24:59.160 --> 25:01.280]  Make sure that you seal up all of the steps.
[25:01.280 --> 25:05.320]  Make sure you seal up every duct joint between the lights and the filter.
[25:05.320 --> 25:09.320]  Every opportunity for a leak, please put some duct tape on there.
[25:09.320 --> 25:13.380]  Do keep in mind that this air may be warm.
[25:13.380 --> 25:15.040]  You're going to run it over the grow light.
[25:15.040 --> 25:16.080]  You may have a 600.
[25:16.080 --> 25:17.840]  You may have two 600s.
[25:17.840 --> 25:21.320]  You may have multiple thousand watt lights if you're doing multiple tents or if you've
[25:21.320 --> 25:23.080]  done this in a large room.
[25:23.080 --> 25:25.800]  Keep in mind that the air is going to be warm.
[25:25.800 --> 25:29.960]  If you're going to run this air outside, think about that air being warm.
[25:29.960 --> 25:35.140]  People may realize you've got some inappropriately weird air coming out of your house at a weird
[25:35.140 --> 25:37.820]  random spot all year long.
[25:37.820 --> 25:42.420]  Maybe it snows and maybe the back of your house has just one little three by three section
[25:42.420 --> 25:45.880]  where there is no snow and you're telling everybody there's some weird shit happening
[25:45.880 --> 25:47.440]  here in my backyard.
[25:47.440 --> 25:48.840]  Be aware of that sort of stuff.
[25:48.840 --> 25:51.960]  It doesn't stink, but that air will be warm.
[25:51.960 --> 25:52.960]  All right.
[25:53.120 --> 25:56.960]  I feel like I went over both of those setups quite quickly, so I'm going to reiterate the
[25:56.960 --> 25:58.480]  one blower style.
[25:58.480 --> 26:04.380]  It is basically carbon filter, blower, ducting, light out of the tent, run the ducting where
[26:04.380 --> 26:05.520]  you need it.
[26:05.520 --> 26:08.960]  Keep it simple, stoner, and you will succeed.
[26:08.960 --> 26:12.880]  I think a lot of the time we are really trying to overcomplicate growing.
[26:12.880 --> 26:18.820]  Now let's talk about some of the other accessories that you have got to go with your grow tent.
[26:18.820 --> 26:20.600]  Those two small clip on fans.
[26:20.600 --> 26:25.000]  If they're small clip on fans, I think the tent will do just fine supporting those fans.
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.920]  Clip those wherever you feel comfortable.
[26:26.920 --> 26:30.360]  I usually like one about canopy high right at the top of the plants.
[26:30.360 --> 26:34.080]  And then sometimes I'll put one about the light height just to move the heat away from
[26:34.080 --> 26:35.080]  the light.
[26:35.080 --> 26:39.840]  If you've got two, you can experiment, move them as you feel necessary.
[26:39.840 --> 26:40.980]  Make your plants happy.
[26:40.980 --> 26:41.980]  Have fun with it.
[26:41.980 --> 26:46.720]  Maybe put some sort of a monitor in there and check out the VPD and get the fans moving
[26:46.720 --> 26:49.200]  to keep that VPD in line.
[26:49.400 --> 26:52.840]  One of your major questions was, where do I put the ballasts?
[26:52.840 --> 26:58.440]  I would absolutely recommend those ballasts do not go inside of the tent.
[26:58.440 --> 26:59.860]  Keep them out of the tent.
[26:59.860 --> 27:02.240]  Those ballasts are going to create a lot of heat.
[27:02.240 --> 27:04.760]  You don't want to fight that heat inside of the tent.
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.880]  So set yourself up for success by putting them outside of the tent.
[27:08.880 --> 27:13.360]  Don't add more heat in that environment than you've already got from the grow lights.
[27:13.360 --> 27:18.160]  All right, I've got one more detail we should talk about when it comes to setting up a grow tent.
[27:18.160 --> 27:23.520]  When we run all of this ducting over our vented lights, we create a great opportunity
[27:23.520 --> 27:25.400]  for a light leak.
[27:25.400 --> 27:27.680]  Many people will say, these tents are sealed up.
[27:27.680 --> 27:29.400]  I shouldn't get any light leaks in here.
[27:29.400 --> 27:30.800]  You really shouldn't.
[27:30.800 --> 27:34.480]  But we are using ducting that is reflective on the inside.
[27:34.480 --> 27:39.720]  I don't know why the companies that make the ducting for hydroponic use insist on making
[27:39.720 --> 27:41.840]  it reflective on the inside.
[27:41.840 --> 27:46.300]  It would be much better if it were flat black and did not reflect light.
[27:46.300 --> 27:47.300]  What will happen?
[27:47.440 --> 27:52.260]  One of the most common situations is light will get up into the ducting and reflect all
[27:52.260 --> 27:56.860]  the way through that ducting and shine through your light hoods just like you've got a light
[27:56.860 --> 27:58.660]  on in your grow tent.
[27:58.660 --> 28:03.860]  So make sure you check that the light is not reflecting down your ducting through your
[28:03.860 --> 28:08.020]  lights and into your plants when you think the lights are off.
[28:08.020 --> 28:11.540]  If your plants are getting light when you think they're dark, they might not go into
[28:11.540 --> 28:12.540]  flower.
[28:12.540 --> 28:16.140]  You may think they've been in 1212, but since you've got that light on in your bedroom all
[28:16.140 --> 28:18.020]  day, they've never gone into flower.
[28:18.020 --> 28:21.740]  They've been getting 24 hours of light and you're way off schedule now.
[28:21.740 --> 28:25.620]  Or you may be going in there just occasionally and flipping on the light while you're playing
[28:25.620 --> 28:28.140]  video games for a couple hours and then you turn it off and leave.
[28:28.140 --> 28:29.980]  Or maybe you go in there and read a book.
[28:29.980 --> 28:32.940]  Maybe just go and hang out and fucking smoke a bowl in there and then you turn off the
[28:32.940 --> 28:36.940]  lights and leave and the light cycle in your grow tent just got interrupted because it
[28:36.940 --> 28:39.100]  was supposed to be on the dark cycle.
[28:39.100 --> 28:43.740]  So I recommend that you go in that tent before you put plants in there.
[28:43.740 --> 28:48.900]  Turn on the lights in the room in which the tent is in, then go in the tent with no lights
[28:48.900 --> 28:51.540]  and hang out and see if you can see any light.
[28:51.540 --> 28:56.420]  If you can see your hand in front of your face at all in the dark, it is not dark.
[28:56.420 --> 29:01.220]  You've got to make it completely dark in that grow tent when it is dark.
[29:01.220 --> 29:04.940]  So make sure no light is coming through your ducting.
[29:04.940 --> 29:09.540]  Another spot where people often get light leaks is from the passive intake vents on
[29:09.540 --> 29:11.400]  the bottom of the tents.
[29:11.400 --> 29:16.120]  On most of the tents, there is basically a small mesh window at the bottom with a little
[29:16.120 --> 29:19.360]  flap that you can Velcro and roll it up or let it down.
[29:19.360 --> 29:21.440]  Kind of just works like a little shade.
[29:21.440 --> 29:25.560]  Many people like to roll that up or lift that up and let some air flow into the bottom of
[29:25.560 --> 29:26.920]  that tent.
[29:26.920 --> 29:29.400]  I do not lift those things all the way up.
[29:29.400 --> 29:36.120]  I leave them about 50% Velcroed to where they can't flap up, but some air can flow through there.
[29:36.120 --> 29:41.380]  You've got a six inch inline fan sucking air out of that tent.
[29:41.380 --> 29:45.780]  If you close the zipper and close most of those passive vents, you will notice that
[29:45.780 --> 29:47.740]  your tent wants to cave in a little bit.
[29:47.740 --> 29:49.480]  It's sucking in on itself.
[29:49.480 --> 29:53.340]  That inline fan will create enough pressure that you will get air coming in through the
[29:53.340 --> 29:57.940]  gaps in the fabric, through the gaps in your zipper, through all of the little tiny holes
[29:57.940 --> 29:59.100]  in that material.
[29:59.100 --> 30:02.420]  You will replace all of the air that goes out of that blower.
[30:02.420 --> 30:05.900]  So you don't have to lift up those passive flaps all the way.
[30:05.900 --> 30:08.020]  They will suck enough air through there.
[30:08.020 --> 30:12.980]  Air travels through the path of least resistance and physics dictates that all of the air that
[30:12.980 --> 30:14.980]  comes in has to go out.
[30:14.980 --> 30:17.220]  All of the air that goes out has to come back in.
[30:17.220 --> 30:18.620]  It's called displacement.
[30:18.620 --> 30:24.700]  So power that blower up and roll those vents down and just let the walls of that tent suck
[30:24.700 --> 30:25.820]  in a little bit.
[30:25.820 --> 30:30.420]  I don't think you'll get any light leaks and I do think you will get plenty of air exchange
[30:30.420 --> 30:34.940]  if you are running that six inch inline fan like my new friend, David.
[30:34.940 --> 30:39.500]  Another thing I've seen people do is simply make a little bit of a shade cloth on the
[30:39.500 --> 30:41.460]  outside of those tents.
[30:41.460 --> 30:46.340]  I've seen guys buy those strips of HEPA filters and just duct tape that over those bottom
[30:46.340 --> 30:47.340]  vents.
[30:47.340 --> 30:52.060]  That helps to keep out extra light and it also works as an extra layer of filtration.
[30:52.060 --> 30:55.820]  You'll notice that those vents down there at the bottom, they'll get kind of, you'll
[30:55.820 --> 31:00.140]  get a bunch of dog hair if you've got a dog, you'll get a bunch of hippie hair if you've
[31:00.140 --> 31:04.260]  got a hippie, you get a bunch of dust bunnies and crap built up along the bottom of there.
[31:04.580 --> 31:07.220]  So make sure you dust that off and clean it up more than occasionally.
[31:07.220 --> 31:10.220]  Get to that about once a week or it'll really start to build up.
[31:10.220 --> 31:14.220]  But if you've got light leaks, I recommend just roll those flaps down and only do half
[31:14.220 --> 31:15.420]  the Velcro.
[31:15.420 --> 31:18.900]  That way they'll be able to lift up halfway, they'll let air in, but they won't let any
[31:18.900 --> 31:19.900]  light in.
[31:19.900 --> 31:23.900]  And if you don't feel comfortable with that, put something over the outside, just a black
[31:23.900 --> 31:29.060]  sheet, a black cloth, or I've seen guys use those long strips of HEPA filters and you
[31:29.060 --> 31:33.100]  just put some duct tape on the outside of it and tape it right to the outside of your
[31:33.100 --> 31:34.100]  tent.
[31:34.140 --> 31:37.180]  You can probably do it on the inside, but since we get that natural suction, when you
[31:37.180 --> 31:41.300]  do it on the outside, it just sucks itself right to the tent, tape it in place, it'll
[31:41.300 --> 31:42.500]  stay right there for you.
[31:42.500 --> 31:46.620]  All right, David, I feel like I really talked for a long time about setting up a grow tent.
[31:46.620 --> 31:48.100]  I really hope I helped you out.
[31:48.100 --> 31:53.140]  I'm sure I have sparked more questions, so I do look forward to a follow-up email.
