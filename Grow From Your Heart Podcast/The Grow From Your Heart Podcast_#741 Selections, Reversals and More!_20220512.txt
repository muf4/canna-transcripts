[00:14.780 --> 00:25.940]  All right, here we go.
[00:25.940 --> 00:27.500]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:27.500 --> 00:28.500]  I'm your host.
[00:28.500 --> 00:29.720]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:29.720 --> 00:35.200]  This is episode 741 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:35.200 --> 00:38.080]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of grow questions.
[00:38.080 --> 00:41.880]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks
[00:41.880 --> 00:45.300]  who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:45.300 --> 00:48.740]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to
[00:48.740 --> 00:50.380]  my friend William Downs.
[00:50.380 --> 00:54.020]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to 716 Vibes and Uncle GG.
[00:54.020 --> 00:57.980]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to my buddy Chicago Dabber and Papa Z.
[00:57.980 --> 01:01.700]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to a longtime friend, my buddy Jesse Grows.
[01:01.700 --> 01:05.020]  I want to send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to a great tester, my friend Levity
[01:05.020 --> 01:06.160]  Love Day.
[01:06.160 --> 01:08.300]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Elders Garden.
[01:08.300 --> 01:12.740]  I want to send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Terry P and EZ057.
[01:12.740 --> 01:15.300]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to my buddy B. Bala.
[01:15.300 --> 01:19.340]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out
[01:19.340 --> 01:21.380]  to Doc Grows.
[01:21.380 --> 01:26.080]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:26.080 --> 01:29.620]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:29.620 --> 01:36.060]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:36.060 --> 01:38.700]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:38.700 --> 01:43.540]  And you know I do include a link to the Patreon in the show notes and in the video description
[01:43.540 --> 01:48.820]  to make it super easy for all of my friends to support the show.
[01:48.820 --> 01:53.700]  Speaking of Patreon, the new Patreon episode will be available by the time this podcast
[01:53.700 --> 01:54.700]  comes out.
[01:54.700 --> 01:56.780]  That Patreon episode will be loaded up.
[01:56.780 --> 02:01.100]  There is a Patreon only, a Patreon exclusive episode that will be posted for the month
[02:01.100 --> 02:02.100]  of May.
[02:02.100 --> 02:06.500]  That episode does include myself and White Mike and we each ate a hundred milligrams
[02:06.500 --> 02:07.500]  of edibles.
[02:07.500 --> 02:08.940]  We rambled on.
[02:08.940 --> 02:10.540]  The show is two hours long.
[02:10.540 --> 02:14.380]  There is not any Grow information in that show to be completely open and honest.
[02:14.380 --> 02:19.300]  I did not put Grow information on the Patreon show because I want to give you guys all of
[02:19.300 --> 02:21.340]  the Grow information, education.
[02:21.340 --> 02:22.340]  I want that to be free.
[02:22.340 --> 02:23.820]  I want people to be able to get that.
[02:23.820 --> 02:26.740]  The Patreon episode is honestly just a hangout with Mike and I.
[02:26.740 --> 02:27.740]  We got lit.
[02:27.740 --> 02:28.740]  We talked shit.
[02:28.740 --> 02:29.740]  It's a good time.
[02:29.740 --> 02:33.300]  So please if you're on the Patreon look for that video with White Mike and myself.
[02:33.300 --> 02:37.020]  By the time this episode comes out that video should have loaded by now.
[02:37.540 --> 02:38.540]  It's a two hour video.
[02:38.540 --> 02:39.540]  It is 4K.
[02:39.540 --> 02:41.020]  It has taken all day to load.
[02:41.020 --> 02:42.020]  You guys don't care.
[02:42.020 --> 02:43.820]  Look for that episode on Patreon.
[02:43.820 --> 02:48.340]  Once again, big thanks to the Iry Army for supporting the show on Patreon.
[02:48.340 --> 02:50.060]  Where do we go from there?
[02:50.060 --> 02:55.180]  Also big thanks for all of the shout outs and support and positive feedback on the Mother's
[02:55.180 --> 02:56.860]  Day episode.
[02:56.860 --> 02:58.940]  Usually I put out shows on Monday morning.
[02:58.940 --> 03:03.180]  I thought it would be nice to put out a show on Mother's Day about mother plants.
[03:03.180 --> 03:07.060]  A lot of people caught the irony there or my gag or my trick or my joke.
[03:07.060 --> 03:08.060]  Whatever it was there.
[03:08.060 --> 03:09.060]  I was trying to be cute.
[03:09.060 --> 03:11.620]  I put out a Mother's Day episode about mother plants.
[03:11.620 --> 03:12.980]  A lot of people saw that.
[03:12.980 --> 03:14.020]  A lot of people commented.
[03:14.020 --> 03:15.240]  They enjoyed the show.
[03:15.240 --> 03:17.740]  They also enjoyed that it was a Mother's Day special.
[03:17.740 --> 03:19.780]  Big thank you for checking out that episode.
[03:19.780 --> 03:21.180]  Big thanks for all the comments.
[03:21.180 --> 03:23.100]  I hope everybody out there had a great Mother's Day.
[03:23.100 --> 03:25.220]  I hope you spent some time with your mom, your family.
[03:25.220 --> 03:27.980]  If your mom's not with us anymore, big hug to mama.
[03:27.980 --> 03:28.980]  Big love to all the moms.
[03:28.980 --> 03:31.100]  Without the moms, none of us would be here.
[03:31.100 --> 03:32.100]  Let's move forward you guys.
[03:32.100 --> 03:34.100]  I do have some topics to talk about.
[03:34.100 --> 03:35.780]  Not just a bunch of rambles on today's episode.
[03:35.780 --> 03:38.620]  I've got a few great emails here in front of me.
[03:38.620 --> 03:40.060]  This one, we're going to jump right into it.
[03:40.060 --> 03:42.560]  This one I titled the selection question.
[03:42.560 --> 03:46.820]  This one comes from our friend that calls themselves JH and it goes a little bit like
[03:46.820 --> 03:47.820]  this.
[03:47.820 --> 03:52.380]  It says, in every 10 to 20 seeds, there is one plant that just looks happy the entire
[03:52.380 --> 03:53.380]  time.
[03:53.380 --> 03:54.540]  So that does make sense.
[03:54.540 --> 03:58.860]  I've noticed sometimes that when you run a pack of seeds, you'll run 10 or 20 seeds and
[03:58.860 --> 04:01.900]  there's always going to be one that just shines.
[04:02.700 --> 04:04.420]  That's the way I describe dating.
[04:04.420 --> 04:07.620]  That's the way I describe finding the phenotype that you like.
[04:07.620 --> 04:09.340]  That one is going to shine.
[04:09.340 --> 04:15.860]  It says, in your opinion, how important is that plant in the selection process?
[04:15.860 --> 04:18.560]  The fact that it just shines says a lot.
[04:18.560 --> 04:22.340]  Is it shining because ... Now there are a couple of things to think about.
[04:22.340 --> 04:26.460]  Is it shining because it's the only one getting the right shit or is it shining because it
[04:26.460 --> 04:27.460]  is thriving?
[04:27.460 --> 04:29.740]  We've got a couple of things to think about.
[04:29.780 --> 04:32.460]  When we run plants for the first time, we don't know what they expect.
[04:32.460 --> 04:39.340]  We just give them ... In most cases, we give them the general 84, 80-ish degrees, 70% humidity.
[04:39.340 --> 04:42.980]  We give them all the basics and we run them the first time and see what they do.
[04:42.980 --> 04:44.280]  Some plants are going to be happy in that.
[04:44.280 --> 04:46.180]  Some are not going to be happy in that.
[04:46.180 --> 04:52.000]  It looks like you're always finding ... That's a good ... The odds of that one plant shining
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.140]  are always really good because we've designed, we've bred these plants to work in the grow
[04:56.140 --> 04:57.260]  rooms which we've designed.
[04:57.260 --> 05:00.380]  The plants have been bred to work in the rooms and the rooms have been designed to
[05:00.380 --> 05:02.660]  work with the plants the way that we bred them.
[05:02.660 --> 05:05.940]  If you've got a 10-pack or a 20-pack in a decent grow room, you're always going to find
[05:05.940 --> 05:08.300]  at least one that super shines.
[05:08.300 --> 05:13.020]  Now, is that one shining because the other nine are not happy or 19 are not happy or
[05:13.020 --> 05:15.460]  is that one shining because it is super happy?
[05:15.460 --> 05:19.100]  Now, also is it shining because that's the one that isn't real picky, doesn't require
[05:19.100 --> 05:20.180]  a lot of stuff?
[05:20.180 --> 05:21.220]  That is a very common thing.
[05:21.220 --> 05:24.180]  What you're running into is just phenotypical expression.
[05:24.180 --> 05:27.380]  One of them is happier than the others and it is shining.
[05:27.380 --> 05:30.700]  How important is that in the selection process?
[05:30.700 --> 05:34.420]  That is half of what we're ... That's a small portion of what we're looking for.
[05:34.420 --> 05:38.380]  Less than half of what we're looking for is the performance of the plants in that one
[05:38.380 --> 05:39.580]  condition.
[05:39.580 --> 05:41.060]  It performed well.
[05:41.060 --> 05:43.880]  That's a good indication that it works well in your environment.
[05:43.880 --> 05:47.460]  That is one really good thing, but how does it smoke?
[05:47.460 --> 05:49.540]  Does it give you a good harvest weight?
[05:49.540 --> 05:51.140]  Does it give you good potency?
[05:51.140 --> 05:53.940]  Does the smoke give you a desirable effect?
[05:53.980 --> 05:54.980]  What is the flavor there?
[05:54.980 --> 05:56.940]  Because flavor matters a lot to me.
[05:56.940 --> 05:58.500]  Flavor and aroma.
[05:58.500 --> 06:00.780]  Does it give you the weight that you need?
[06:00.780 --> 06:05.300]  Those are also very important factors to think about during a selection process.
[06:05.300 --> 06:06.300]  Growing it is great.
[06:06.300 --> 06:10.100]  If it grows well, that's really cool, but once you cut it down, the consumer has no
[06:10.100 --> 06:12.180]  idea how it grew and they don't care.
[06:12.180 --> 06:16.220]  A lot of times, the best plants to smoke are the plants that grew like shit in the garden.
[06:16.220 --> 06:20.940]  The one that the grower had to struggle with is the one that the smokers really enjoy quite
[06:20.940 --> 06:22.620]  often.
[06:22.620 --> 06:25.140]  It's like a chessboard.
[06:25.140 --> 06:26.140]  We call it memetics.
[06:26.140 --> 06:30.020]  You got 64 squares on a chessboard, right?
[06:30.020 --> 06:34.020]  This one looking good in the grow room during the grow is one square of the chessboard.
[06:34.020 --> 06:35.020]  We need potency.
[06:35.020 --> 06:36.060]  We need bug resistance.
[06:36.060 --> 06:38.020]  We need turps.
[06:38.020 --> 06:41.500]  We need all kinds of other things to make this a winner, not just one square on the
[06:41.500 --> 06:42.500]  chessboard.
[06:42.500 --> 06:44.880]  You got to cover the whole board if you want to win.
[06:44.880 --> 06:45.880]  There is more to this.
[06:45.880 --> 06:46.880]  It goes on.
[06:46.880 --> 06:49.640]  It says, I'm bad at describing things, but I'm sure you know this plant.
[06:49.640 --> 06:54.160]  It always has the perfect leaf angle, perfect color, no visible signs of stress, and it
[06:54.160 --> 06:56.640]  looks like she just wants to give you a high five.
[06:56.640 --> 07:00.560]  Yes, I do know that plant very well.
[07:00.560 --> 07:04.440]  Once you grow a lot more and you get more experienced, you'll be able to get every plant
[07:04.440 --> 07:06.240]  in the room to look that way.
[07:06.240 --> 07:07.240]  You'll know that.
[07:07.240 --> 07:10.680]  This one, I need to move it away from the light because it doesn't like the extra heat,
[07:10.680 --> 07:12.480]  but if I put it in the corner, it kind of enjoys that.
[07:12.480 --> 07:16.160]  The other one, it needs to go right under the light because it wants all the extra light.
[07:16.160 --> 07:17.680]  This one, I shouldn't water it so much.
[07:17.720 --> 07:20.600]  This one, I can practically overwater it and it loves it.
[07:20.600 --> 07:25.640]  You'll start learning those individual plants, but in selection, something I say a lot of
[07:25.640 --> 07:28.440]  times is don't select the plant for the internet.
[07:28.440 --> 07:30.480]  We're not selecting for internet purposes.
[07:30.480 --> 07:36.280]  We are selecting for potency, vigor, resistance to bugs, turps.
[07:36.280 --> 07:38.600]  There are a lot of other things that we're selecting for.
[07:38.600 --> 07:41.600]  If you're selecting for Instagram, for photos, that is the great phenotype.
[07:41.600 --> 07:42.600]  We've got to smoke it.
[07:42.600 --> 07:46.320]  We've got to grow it all the way out, dry it, cure it, finish it, and then see if it
[07:46.320 --> 07:47.320]  is desirable.
[07:47.440 --> 07:51.080]  That's the only way to tell is to dry it, cure it, smoke it, and see what you've got.
[07:51.080 --> 07:52.080]  It goes on.
[07:52.080 --> 07:55.920]  It says, that being said, I haven't had the happiest plant and the best smelling plant
[07:55.920 --> 07:59.900]  line up ever in 18 years of sprouting 10 seeds at a time.
[07:59.900 --> 08:02.400]  Is that just bad luck or am I doing something wrong?
[08:02.400 --> 08:07.120]  No, that is the way that the weed gods like to mess with us.
[08:07.120 --> 08:08.120]  We've learned how to grow.
[08:08.120 --> 08:09.360]  You've been growing, it says 18 years.
[08:09.360 --> 08:13.200]  You've been growing cannabis, producing cannabis for 18 years, which means you're pretty good
[08:13.200 --> 08:14.200]  at it by now.
[08:14.200 --> 08:15.400]  I hope you're pretty good at it by now.
[08:15.400 --> 08:16.400]  You've got a flow.
[08:16.480 --> 08:17.480]  You've got a rhythm.
[08:17.480 --> 08:18.480]  You're comfortable.
[08:18.480 --> 08:20.080]  You've got a lot of skills.
[08:20.080 --> 08:22.000]  The world goes, oh, you got some skills, you think?
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.040]  How about instead of giving you this perfect plant, we're going to give you two to choose
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.040]  from.
[08:26.040 --> 08:29.520]  I often make the joke that when you run a 10-pack, one is going to be best for the consumer
[08:29.520 --> 08:31.680]  and one is going to be best for the grower.
[08:31.680 --> 08:32.680]  It's kind of what you're saying here.
[08:32.680 --> 08:36.240]  The happiest plant and best smelling plant don't seem to line up.
[08:36.240 --> 08:39.520]  The one that the consumers want, they never saw how much of a pain in the ass that plant
[08:39.520 --> 08:40.520]  was to grow.
[08:40.520 --> 08:42.440]  They go, I want an ounce of this.
[08:42.440 --> 08:47.000]  That one that grew super simply for you and put out all the weight, it wasn't the desirable.
[08:47.000 --> 08:48.800]  It's never the desirable one for the consumer.
[08:48.800 --> 08:52.080]  That is kind of a joke that I say the weed gods play on us.
[08:52.080 --> 08:53.560]  That is very common.
[08:53.560 --> 08:54.800]  You're not doing anything wrong.
[08:54.800 --> 08:58.640]  That is just how phenotypes work.
[08:58.640 --> 09:01.880]  I always find at least one keeper in a 10-pack of my stuff.
[09:01.880 --> 09:05.040]  The hard part is deciding which of the three I usually want to keep.
[09:05.040 --> 09:09.280]  There's one that usually tastes real good, one that's usually super potent, and then
[09:09.280 --> 09:11.800]  that one that just super fucking performs.
[09:11.840 --> 09:15.680]  The goal there is to breed that line further and get the things that you want out of that.
[09:15.680 --> 09:18.000]  But no, you're not doing anything wrong.
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.560]  You are doing it just right.
[09:19.560 --> 09:24.680]  In my opinion, that is just a funny joke that the cannabis gods, the ganja gods play on us.
[09:24.680 --> 09:28.720]  The best smelling one and the best performing plant are not the same.
[09:28.720 --> 09:32.680]  The consumer and the grower are always going to have different opinions in that aspect.
[09:32.680 --> 09:36.000]  All right, my friend JH, I feel like I rambled on quite a bit about that question.
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.000]  I hope I helped you out.
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.000]  I hope I answered your question.
[09:38.240 --> 09:41.880]  If you've got any follow-ups, I would love to hear your follow-up question.
[09:41.880 --> 09:44.680]  If anybody else out there has any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns on this
[09:44.680 --> 09:49.080]  question, my email address, of course, is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[09:49.080 --> 09:50.080]  Don't be shy.
[09:50.080 --> 09:51.080]  Reach on out.
[09:51.080 --> 09:52.080]  I will answer your questions.
[09:52.080 --> 09:54.120]  I do have another message right here in front of me.
[09:54.120 --> 09:56.000]  This one came from Patreon.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.560]  Big shout-out to all the Patreon supporters.
[09:58.560 --> 10:01.100]  This one came from Guido's Grow Room.
[10:01.100 --> 10:04.160]  Big shout-out to my buddy Guido at Guido's Grow Room.
[10:04.160 --> 10:05.760]  You say that three times fast.
[10:05.760 --> 10:07.360]  One time was hard enough.
[10:07.360 --> 10:12.000]  It goes on and it says, hey, Mr. RJ, got a quick question for you.
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.560]  I'm getting ready to flip some plants via STS.
[10:14.560 --> 10:19.040]  So he's going to reverse some plants using a silver thiosulfate solution.
[10:19.040 --> 10:21.420]  I've talked a lot about that on other episodes.
[10:21.420 --> 10:26.080]  If you want to learn a lot more about reversing plants with silver thiosulfate, I've done
[10:26.080 --> 10:27.080]  a full podcast.
[10:27.080 --> 10:31.000]  Simply Google Grow From Your Heart Podcast STS mix or MySTS.
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  It will come up.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.300]  It says, so he said, I'm getting ready to reverse some plants via silver thiosulfate.
[10:38.240 --> 10:43.340]  I am wondering if you have ever done it under an 11-13 DJ Short style light cycle.
[10:43.340 --> 10:44.620]  That's a very good question.
[10:44.620 --> 10:46.340]  Let me explain what that means.
[10:46.340 --> 10:52.540]  Most of the time, we put our plants on 12 hours on and 12 hours off to trigger the flowering
[10:52.540 --> 10:53.600]  phase.
[10:53.600 --> 10:59.220]  Our friend DJ Short a long time ago taught us that 11 hours on and 13 hours off will
[10:59.220 --> 11:01.420]  give us different results.
[11:01.420 --> 11:03.700]  In some cases, they are improved results.
[11:03.700 --> 11:05.920]  In some cases, they are diminished results.
[11:05.920 --> 11:07.640]  It depends on your goal.
[11:07.640 --> 11:13.280]  I think that the extended dark period gives the plants an opportunity to show their expression
[11:13.280 --> 11:14.400]  a little bit more.
[11:14.400 --> 11:20.080]  We see more phenotypical variation, more phenotypical expression is what it is that I believe I'm
[11:20.080 --> 11:22.840]  seeing with this extended dark period.
[11:22.840 --> 11:24.280]  This is not common practice for me.
[11:24.280 --> 11:25.280]  I've stopped doing this.
[11:25.280 --> 11:28.440]  I do something way different, which I've talked about in other episodes.
[11:28.440 --> 11:32.080]  But DJ Short has been doing the 11-13 for a long time.
[11:32.080 --> 11:33.220]  It's got a lot of advantages.
[11:33.220 --> 11:39.180]  If you think about it, if you're flowering for 63 days, that is 63 hours of electricity
[11:39.180 --> 11:40.780]  that you don't have to run.
[11:40.780 --> 11:45.180]  That's 63 hours of power that didn't go through your light bulb, your air conditioner, your
[11:45.180 --> 11:46.940]  blower, all your fans.
[11:46.940 --> 11:51.780]  Everything got to chill out and cool down for 63 extra hours, which economically, that
[11:51.780 --> 11:52.780]  is great.
[11:52.780 --> 11:56.940]  But in my opinion, photons are the number one source of energy for that plant.
[11:56.940 --> 11:59.460]  So I want to give them all the light that they can get.
[11:59.460 --> 12:01.620]  That's a whole other debate, a whole other conversation.
[12:01.620 --> 12:06.860]  Right now, we're talking about putting these plants under 11-13 after they have been treated
[12:06.860 --> 12:12.120]  with the silver thiosulfate solution in an attempt to make feminized seeds.
[12:12.120 --> 12:13.120]  It goes on.
[12:13.120 --> 12:17.740]  It says, I've got four ladies in the room flowering now, and we'll be adding the two
[12:17.740 --> 12:20.820]  reversal candidates into the spot tomorrow.
[12:20.820 --> 12:23.980]  Shouldn't be any issues, right?
[12:23.980 --> 12:25.700]  I do see an issue, my dude.
[12:25.700 --> 12:30.780]  If the four ladies are in the flowering room now, and you're just adding the two reversal
[12:30.940 --> 12:34.660]  candidates, you may have mistimed this.
[12:34.660 --> 12:40.420]  My general practice, my standard operating procedure is to begin the reversal, get the
[12:40.420 --> 12:41.820]  plants being sprayed.
[12:41.820 --> 12:44.700]  I spray them 10 to 14 days.
[12:44.700 --> 12:49.380]  The first plant to get reversed gets sprayed 10 to 14 days before it goes into flower.
[12:49.380 --> 12:54.700]  Then that one will get sprayed again on day one of flower, then day three, six, nine,
[12:54.700 --> 12:58.660]  12, 15, 18, 21, and possibly day 24.
[12:58.660 --> 13:05.180]  I do not put the pollen receiving plants into that room until I see those reversed
[13:05.180 --> 13:10.000]  plants begin to show me definite signs of male flowers.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.180]  When I start seeing those pollen sacs pop up, that is when I move the female plants
[13:14.180 --> 13:15.180]  into the room.
[13:15.180 --> 13:16.180]  That is how I time it.
[13:16.180 --> 13:21.780]  I really think that timing works out because it's gonna be a few days now, several days,
[13:21.780 --> 13:25.300]  26 to 32 days before that male plant starts producing pollen.
[13:25.300 --> 13:29.620]  If your girls are already in there, how long have they been in there?
[13:29.620 --> 13:30.620]  Flowering now, I'll be adding two reversal.
[13:30.620 --> 13:33.360]  So you don't say how long they've been in there, but they're ahead.
[13:33.360 --> 13:35.780]  They're too far ahead of the male plants.
[13:35.780 --> 13:41.780]  They're gonna be past their peak ovulation point of receiving pollen to create seeds
[13:41.780 --> 13:44.420]  if you don't get those males dumping pollen a little bit sooner.
[13:44.420 --> 13:45.420]  It will work.
[13:45.420 --> 13:46.420]  Don't panic.
[13:46.420 --> 13:47.420]  Don't freak out.
[13:47.420 --> 13:48.420]  It will work.
[13:48.420 --> 13:52.980]  But if you had timed it a little bit differently, you would make a lot more seed, many, probably
[13:52.980 --> 13:54.620]  double the amount of seeds, honestly.
[13:54.940 --> 13:56.100]  It's all about timing.
[13:56.100 --> 13:59.900]  You want those plants, the female plants, the pollen receivers, to have the most...I
[13:59.900 --> 14:01.200]  call it dandelions.
[14:01.200 --> 14:03.300]  People understand what I mean when I say the dandelions.
[14:03.300 --> 14:05.180]  When it starts making...you guys call it hairs.
[14:05.180 --> 14:06.600]  Those are pistils.
[14:06.600 --> 14:08.900]  When it starts making, all the hairs start popping up.
[14:08.900 --> 14:11.220]  Those hairs are what are gonna catch the pollen.
[14:11.220 --> 14:12.220]  That's what catches the pollen.
[14:12.220 --> 14:16.300]  It draws the pollen down that into the ovule, into the bracton, into the calyx, starts forming
[14:16.300 --> 14:17.740]  a seed within that area.
[14:17.740 --> 14:21.100]  But all those hairs are what are going to make the seed.
[14:21.100 --> 14:25.620]  Those hairs have to be at the prime peak point for pollination to get the most seeds.
[14:25.620 --> 14:29.860]  When they're real thick and real strong-looking, right after that is when they want the most
[14:29.860 --> 14:30.860]  pollen.
[14:30.860 --> 14:34.060]  Then they start fading, they start wrinkling, start crinkling up, start getting brown.
[14:34.060 --> 14:37.460]  Once they get withered up and small, they can no longer receive pollen.
[14:37.460 --> 14:39.740]  They've passed their peak point of pollination.
[14:39.740 --> 14:44.500]  They've gone into...I guess they've gone into menopause, if you wanna compare them to people.
[14:44.500 --> 14:48.540]  So I think you are doing okay, but the timing could have been better.
[14:48.540 --> 14:49.540]  But don't panic.
[14:49.540 --> 14:50.540]  Don't tear it down.
[14:50.540 --> 14:51.540]  Do what you're doing.
[14:51.540 --> 14:54.180]  You're gonna get seeds out of this.
[14:54.180 --> 14:55.180]  Shouldn't be any issues.
[14:55.180 --> 14:56.180]  Right.
[14:56.180 --> 14:58.620]  I think the 11-13 cycle should work.
[14:58.620 --> 15:02.340]  Honestly, I have not done that, so I don't have a testimony.
[15:02.340 --> 15:07.580]  But with the info I've got, the knowledge, experience, I think it will work.
[15:07.580 --> 15:09.860]  I think it will do what needs done.
[15:09.860 --> 15:15.020]  It may help you out because your male, your reversal plants may actually flip more quickly
[15:15.020 --> 15:16.740]  because they're sleeping longer.
[15:16.740 --> 15:18.140]  I'm not sure how that will work.
[15:18.140 --> 15:21.340]  It may be beneficial to correct your timing issue.
[15:21.340 --> 15:22.340]  It goes on.
[15:22.340 --> 15:26.020]  It says, and of course, once they start to show boy parts, they'll go into the breeding
[15:26.020 --> 15:27.020]  tent.
[15:27.020 --> 15:31.900]  Just need a week to finish trim jail as I dry in the other tent too.
[15:31.900 --> 15:35.540]  I hope you have an awesome day, my man, and thank you for your time.
[15:35.540 --> 15:38.300]  My buddy Guido, thank you for the great question.
[15:38.300 --> 15:41.460]  It sounds like you've got the right idea, but I think the timing may have been off just
[15:41.460 --> 15:42.460]  a little bit.
[15:42.460 --> 15:43.500]  But I understand why.
[15:43.500 --> 15:45.260]  We're limited on space.
[15:45.260 --> 15:49.340]  You're stuck in trim jail, which should I ramble on that or should I just let it go?
[15:49.340 --> 15:52.980]  Trim jail is a weird thing to me because I actually have friends in jail and if I said
[15:52.980 --> 15:56.300]  trim jail to them, they'd be like, motherfucker, do you see where I am?
[15:56.300 --> 15:59.980]  And they'd find it really disrespectful for me to say that sitting here, sitting at the
[15:59.980 --> 16:04.220]  table, listening to Sublime, eating Doritos, talking to my friends and cutting up weed
[16:04.220 --> 16:07.300]  under the air conditioner to put the word jail in there.
[16:07.300 --> 16:11.620]  My friends in real jail would be fucking offended.
[16:11.620 --> 16:12.820]  They'd find it disrespectful.
[16:12.820 --> 16:13.940]  That's my quick rant on that.
[16:13.940 --> 16:14.940]  Nobody cares about that.
[16:15.620 --> 16:17.820]  That's a silly fucking word to say.
[16:17.820 --> 16:20.780]  There's real people in real jail.
[16:20.780 --> 16:21.780]  But I get it, dude.
[16:21.780 --> 16:22.780]  I get what you've got to do.
[16:22.780 --> 16:23.780]  You had to time it that way.
[16:23.780 --> 16:26.740]  I think it's going to work and I think your light cycle will work.
[16:26.740 --> 16:30.460]  I think everything will turn out just the way that you want it to.
[16:30.460 --> 16:32.180]  My request is send me an update.
[16:32.180 --> 16:33.180]  Send me feedback.
[16:33.180 --> 16:34.180]  Send me details.
[16:34.180 --> 16:35.180]  How does this work?
[16:35.180 --> 16:37.700]  How many seeds do you pull from the plants that you put in there?
[16:37.700 --> 16:39.780]  Are you satisfied with the outcome?
[16:39.780 --> 16:41.740]  And did you get pollen on time?
[16:41.740 --> 16:43.420]  That is going to be my main question.
[16:43.460 --> 16:45.260]  So Guido, send me a follow up.
[16:45.260 --> 16:46.260]  Send me some info, bro.
[16:46.260 --> 16:48.500]  I can't wait for the follow up.
[16:48.500 --> 16:49.620]  This came on May 9th.
[16:49.620 --> 16:51.980]  So it should be a couple of weeks here before I get more info.
[16:51.980 --> 16:56.060]  I'll give you until about June 1st and I'll expect an update from you, my dude.
[16:56.060 --> 16:58.380]  All right, Guido, thank you for the great message.
[16:58.380 --> 16:59.940]  Let's see how long we've been rambling.
[16:59.940 --> 17:02.460]  We've got plenty of time for one more message.
[17:02.460 --> 17:04.680]  I got a great question here in front of me.
[17:04.680 --> 17:12.620]  This one came on the growfromyourheartathotmail.com email address and it goes a lot like this.
[17:12.620 --> 17:14.380]  It says, hey Ross to Jeff.
[17:14.380 --> 17:15.820]  My actual name is Jack.
[17:15.820 --> 17:16.820]  What's up, Jack?
[17:16.820 --> 17:17.820]  Good to meet you, my dude.
[17:17.820 --> 17:22.140]  It says, when you used a thousand watt HPS, which is a high pressure sodium lamp, what
[17:22.140 --> 17:27.580]  reflector type and what distance to the canopy do you find to be optimal?
[17:27.580 --> 17:30.300]  That is a very good question.
[17:30.300 --> 17:36.780]  When I was running a thousand watt high pressure sodium light, let's talk about my personal
[17:36.780 --> 17:40.500]  small home grow because I'm pretty sure this person isn't running a commercial grow with
[17:40.580 --> 17:43.260]  Govitas, which is what I do in a commercial environment.
[17:43.260 --> 17:47.140]  Let's talk about a small home grow or a small personal private setup.
[17:47.140 --> 17:52.660]  If I had a thousand watt HPS, what reflector type and what distance do I find to be optimal?
[17:52.660 --> 17:53.980]  We've got a few options.
[17:53.980 --> 17:57.240]  I really like the vented and ducted hoods.
[17:57.240 --> 17:58.940]  That sounds weird to a lot of people.
[17:58.940 --> 18:02.620]  Let me try to explain what I'm talking about because some people may not know.
[18:02.620 --> 18:07.280]  We basically, so all lights, not all, but the basic design of a grow light is that you've
[18:07.280 --> 18:10.400]  got your bulb and the bulb hangs horizontally.
[18:10.400 --> 18:13.960]  It's going this way, it screws into the socket and it goes this way.
[18:13.960 --> 18:18.000]  Then when it shines, the light goes all out of that bulb every direction.
[18:18.000 --> 18:21.880]  We've put it inside of what we call a reflector or a hood.
[18:21.880 --> 18:24.040]  It does just like what it sounds like it's supposed to do.
[18:24.040 --> 18:26.080]  It reflects the light down.
[18:26.080 --> 18:29.760]  All that light that goes up from the top of the bulb hits that reflector and gets spread
[18:29.760 --> 18:32.080]  down onto our plants, down onto our canopy.
[18:32.080 --> 18:33.480]  We're paying for all that light.
[18:33.480 --> 18:37.840]  We want to move that light down where we want it, get those photons to the plants.
[18:37.840 --> 18:41.600]  The light bulb is inside of this, basically an umbrella.
[18:41.600 --> 18:45.920]  Think of it as an umbrella that is directing the light back down onto your plants.
[18:45.920 --> 18:50.640]  Now think about, there's going to be a lot of heat generated by that bulb.
[18:50.640 --> 18:52.260]  That heat is going to come down.
[18:52.260 --> 18:56.360]  Heat does rise, but that heat will come down into the plant area, into the canopy.
[18:56.360 --> 19:02.360]  It will also raise, rise up out of that environment, that hood there, that duct, the shield, the
[19:02.360 --> 19:06.560]  reflector, it'll rise up out of there and start heating up the grow room very rapidly.
[19:06.560 --> 19:10.440]  A thousand watt light puts off a lot of BTUs of heat.
[19:10.440 --> 19:14.000]  One thing that I like to do is buy what is known as a ducted hood.
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.920]  It's got glass underneath there.
[19:15.920 --> 19:21.120]  The light goes inside the hood or in the reflector and glass goes underneath that.
[19:21.120 --> 19:26.040]  The heat cannot escape from that enclosure and it stays inside of there, but they've
[19:26.040 --> 19:30.760]  added six or eight inch flanges on either end of it to where you can run ducting in
[19:30.760 --> 19:35.960]  and ducting out and put a blower at one end and extract that heat from that light and
[19:35.960 --> 19:38.040]  get it away from the grow environment.
[19:38.040 --> 19:43.480]  I run a carbon filter, then ducting, then the light, then more ducting, and that goes
[19:43.480 --> 19:44.880]  right out of the enclosure.
[19:44.880 --> 19:49.040]  If it's a house, if it's a warehouse, if it's into another room, if it's a garage, I run
[19:49.040 --> 19:53.720]  that right out to another place just to exhaust that heat, get rid of it immediately and never
[19:53.720 --> 19:56.000]  even makes it into the grow environment.
[19:56.000 --> 20:01.240]  In the winter, I'll actually dump that into either a veg room or a bed room just to use
[20:01.240 --> 20:02.480]  that heat, utilize the heat.
[20:02.480 --> 20:04.560]  I'm spending the money on the electricity.
[20:04.560 --> 20:08.540]  Let's utilize that heat that I heated up, get something out of it.
[20:08.540 --> 20:12.960]  My favorite light setup in a thousand watt environment for a home grow or a personal
[20:12.960 --> 20:19.360]  project grow is a reflector with glass at the bottom and the flanges at the end that
[20:19.360 --> 20:20.360]  is ducted.
[20:20.360 --> 20:24.120]  We call that a vented hood so that I can just move that heat right away from that grow light
[20:24.240 --> 20:26.440]  and get it right out of the grow environment.
[20:26.440 --> 20:27.520]  That is kind of old school.
[20:27.520 --> 20:32.840]  That is kind of archaic, but honestly, when I'm trying something new in my grow space,
[20:32.840 --> 20:38.560]  if I'm trying a new nutrient, a new grow style, a new product or anything new, I run those
[20:38.560 --> 20:41.440]  HPS lights because I've had the best results with those.
[20:41.440 --> 20:43.560]  I've got the most experience with those.
[20:43.560 --> 20:45.280]  I know how to operate those very well.
[20:45.280 --> 20:46.280]  That's old school.
[20:46.280 --> 20:49.360]  It's kind of archaic, but it works really well for me.
[20:49.360 --> 20:51.320]  I have got a lot of LED lights.
[20:51.320 --> 20:53.720]  I've been gifted LED lights.
[20:53.720 --> 20:58.960]  People offer me LED lighting and sometimes I just go right back to those HPS lights just
[20:58.960 --> 21:01.480]  because they're reliable and I love the way that they work.
[21:01.480 --> 21:07.480]  In a commercial grow, I always prefer double-ended Gevita HPS lighting for my flowering rooms.
[21:07.480 --> 21:08.480]  That's always what I prefer.
[21:08.480 --> 21:15.400]  Now, the next part of the question was distance from the canopy to be optimal.
[21:15.400 --> 21:18.360]  I talked about a vented light, a vented hood.
[21:18.360 --> 21:23.460]  If your light is not vented, this answer is going to vary greatly.
[21:24.200 --> 21:27.060]  If the hood is vented and I'm moving a lot of air through there and getting that heat
[21:27.060 --> 21:32.100]  from that bulb away from that reflector, I can get those bulbs, that reflector down super
[21:32.100 --> 21:33.780]  close to the plants.
[21:33.780 --> 21:40.020]  Depending on the age and size of the plant, I can get somewhere between 6 and 24 inches
[21:40.020 --> 21:41.020]  from the canopy.
[21:41.020 --> 21:45.740]  That may sound crazy, but you've got a thousand watt light on a bunch of clones that are 8
[21:45.740 --> 21:46.820]  inches tall.
[21:46.820 --> 21:51.780]  Drop that bitch down to about 24, 18 inches above those and then as they grow up, raise
[21:52.500 --> 21:56.300]  the light and when the light can't go anymore, I just let those plants grow right up to it.
[21:56.300 --> 22:01.020]  By the time they're done, they may be 6 or 8 inches from that light, but it is ducted,
[22:01.020 --> 22:04.820]  it is vented, so they're not getting any heat stress, they're not getting any problems,
[22:04.820 --> 22:07.260]  they're not getting bleached from the light because they grew into it.
[22:07.260 --> 22:09.260]  I didn't just drop that light right on there.
[22:09.260 --> 22:10.660]  I let them grow up into it.
[22:10.660 --> 22:11.820]  They knew what they were getting into.
[22:11.820 --> 22:14.340]  They adjusted, they adapted slowly.
[22:14.340 --> 22:20.580]  It all depends on the plant size and the plant health and how hot you are getting that environment.
[22:20.580 --> 22:24.180]  If you can keep it cool, if you can move that light, get it low, get it on there.
[22:24.180 --> 22:28.460]  If you drop that light right on there, you'll notice real stacked, tight, dense buds, real
[22:28.460 --> 22:31.780]  tight internodal spacing, that close of the light.
[22:31.780 --> 22:33.620]  Learn about the law of the inverse square.
[22:33.620 --> 22:38.420]  The further we get that light away, we definitely start diminishing the value of that light.
[22:38.420 --> 22:41.580]  We get a bigger footprint, but we don't get the intense.
[22:41.580 --> 22:43.700]  It's the law of inverse square.
[22:43.700 --> 22:44.980]  Read about that with lighting.
[22:44.980 --> 22:45.980]  You'll learn a lot there.
[22:45.980 --> 22:47.420]  I cannot even delve into that.
[22:47.860 --> 22:52.060]  When it comes to lighting, lighting definitely is not my specialty.
[22:52.060 --> 22:53.060]  I know about it.
[22:53.060 --> 22:57.380]  I can talk about this really easily, but when it comes to spectrums and numbers and Kelvins,
[22:57.380 --> 23:00.500]  my brain does not absorb that info.
[23:00.500 --> 23:04.460]  I'm lighting ignorant, to be mostly honest with you.
[23:04.460 --> 23:06.980]  For this thousand watt reflector, I would drop it real low.
[23:06.980 --> 23:12.340]  If you're not using a vented reflector, stay at least 18 inches above those plants or they're
[23:12.340 --> 23:13.740]  going to get roasted.
[23:13.740 --> 23:16.820]  Stay at least 18 inches above or they will get too hot.
[23:17.220 --> 23:19.340]  Have a fan going, move that heat around.
[23:19.340 --> 23:21.980]  I get as close as I can and I start paying attention.
[23:21.980 --> 23:23.300]  Do I see the leaves curling up?
[23:23.300 --> 23:25.660]  Do they start giving me signs that they're pissed off?
[23:25.660 --> 23:28.220]  If so, then I just raise that light up just a little bit.
[23:28.220 --> 23:29.740]  I really like to push things.
[23:29.740 --> 23:32.300]  That comes with experience.
[23:32.300 --> 23:34.100]  You've really got to just do it to learn it.
[23:34.100 --> 23:36.020]  I say get in there and experience some shit.
[23:36.020 --> 23:38.780]  If you cook some plants, you'll learn what the cook limit is.
[23:38.780 --> 23:40.260]  It's how you burn a pizza.
[23:40.260 --> 23:43.620]  That pizza oven, the fucking box says leave it in for 12 minutes.
[23:43.620 --> 23:44.620]  You try it for nine.
[23:44.620 --> 23:45.620]  You check on it.
[23:45.620 --> 23:46.620]  It looks good.
[23:47.420 --> 23:48.420]  It looks cool.
[23:48.420 --> 23:49.420]  If you leave it in there for 13, that thing's fucking toast.
[23:49.420 --> 23:50.420]  You just got to learn it.
[23:50.420 --> 23:52.020]  You got to figure it out.
[23:52.020 --> 23:55.900]  As long as the thing is cooled, you can get it really, really low.
[23:55.900 --> 23:59.140]  Now, let me talk about more of what you've got printed here.
[23:59.140 --> 24:03.340]  It says my room is a four and a half by four and a half room and my ceiling is six and
[24:03.340 --> 24:05.860]  a half feet high.
[24:05.860 --> 24:08.580]  I would definitely get a ducted and vented hood if you could.
[24:08.580 --> 24:10.380]  That would definitely be ideal for that room.
[24:10.380 --> 24:11.380]  Then it goes on.
[24:11.380 --> 24:16.700]  It says I have a 600 and a 400 watt HPS system I can use, but I'm thinking about buying a
[24:16.700 --> 24:20.580]  thousand watt HPS system to fix my stretching problem.
[24:20.580 --> 24:25.300]  Do you think the two lights are equal or lesser than a single 1000?
[24:25.300 --> 24:26.420]  That is a really good question.
[24:26.420 --> 24:28.460]  I want to touch on something before I go too far.
[24:28.460 --> 24:29.500]  Your stretch problem.
[24:29.500 --> 24:35.300]  Let's talk about other ways that could help with the stretch because the light is a good
[24:35.300 --> 24:36.300]  idea.
[24:36.300 --> 24:40.180]  The light is one great step to mitigate the stretch, but is your temperature and humidity
[24:40.180 --> 24:41.180]  dialed in?
[24:41.980 --> 24:43.060]  If it's too hot, the plants are going to start stretching.
[24:43.060 --> 24:47.140]  If it's too dry or too wet, the plants are going to start stretching.
[24:47.140 --> 24:50.460]  What is your nighttime temperature and humidity like?
[24:50.460 --> 24:53.180]  How drastic are your diurnal swings?
[24:53.180 --> 24:57.080]  Is your daytime and nighttime temperature and humidity within five or 10 degrees?
[24:57.080 --> 25:01.160]  If you can keep those super close within five degrees, that will drastically reduce the
[25:01.160 --> 25:03.400]  amount of stretch you get from those plants.
[25:03.400 --> 25:06.240]  Other things I've talked about is popping the knuckles on the plants, doing a little
[25:06.240 --> 25:09.860]  bit of LST, a little bit of super cropping where you grab the plant and just twist it
[25:09.940 --> 25:14.340]  and give it a little pop sound there.
[25:14.340 --> 25:15.780]  That will slow down the stretch.
[25:15.780 --> 25:17.420]  Those are things that could help.
[25:17.420 --> 25:20.900]  If we're going to do it with lighting, one thing I would think about, you've got two
[25:20.900 --> 25:22.260]  fixtures here.
[25:22.260 --> 25:26.900]  I wonder if that 400 watt system will run a metal halide.
[25:26.900 --> 25:27.900]  Hear me out.
[25:27.900 --> 25:29.100]  This is what I would do.
[25:29.100 --> 25:30.700]  Tell me if you think I'm fucking crazy.
[25:30.700 --> 25:33.300]  Send me an email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[25:33.300 --> 25:38.780]  If you were going to do this, I would run the 600 watt high pressure sodium and the
[25:38.780 --> 25:42.060]  400 watt metal halide together as close as you can.
[25:42.060 --> 25:45.180]  Not as close as you can get them, but fairly close together in the dead center of that
[25:45.180 --> 25:46.180]  room.
[25:46.180 --> 25:48.540]  You've got a four by five room.
[25:48.540 --> 25:50.500]  That's not very big, a four by five square.
[25:50.500 --> 25:51.900]  That's not very big.
[25:51.900 --> 25:56.060]  That 400 will get enough light down into there, especially with such a low ceiling.
[25:56.060 --> 25:57.980]  The 600 will get enough light down in there.
[25:57.980 --> 26:02.740]  I'd put those right at the center of the room and run both of them, the metal halide and
[26:02.740 --> 26:04.300]  the high pressure sodium.
[26:04.300 --> 26:06.180]  You'll get a lot of great effects from that.
[26:06.180 --> 26:10.740]  The metal halide, the blue spectrum from the metal halide will help you keep that light
[26:10.740 --> 26:12.580]  or that plant short and squat.
[26:12.580 --> 26:15.620]  Here's a quick detail that I have forgot to talk about.
[26:15.620 --> 26:17.420]  This is something I used to say a long time ago.
[26:17.420 --> 26:19.980]  This detail just came to my mind as I was rambling.
[26:19.980 --> 26:24.180]  If you guys are experiencing too much stretch during the beginning of flower, another thing
[26:24.180 --> 26:29.540]  we can do to mitigate that stretch is don't change your bulb until 14 to 21 days into
[26:29.540 --> 26:30.540]  flower.
[26:30.540 --> 26:33.260]  After the stretch phase is over, then switch to that red bulb.
[26:33.260 --> 26:37.580]  If you're running metal halides and HPSs, the blue from the metal halide will keep those
[26:37.580 --> 26:40.460]  plants shorter and squattier and more stacked.
[26:40.460 --> 26:44.540]  Once you see that stretch stop, then switch over to your flower bulb.
[26:44.540 --> 26:46.420]  Let me get back on track to what I was saying.
[26:46.420 --> 26:48.380]  I would use the 600 and 400.
[26:48.380 --> 26:50.660]  I would do the 600 watt high pressure sodium.
[26:50.660 --> 26:54.260]  I would do a 400 watt metal halide and I would run them together.
[26:54.260 --> 26:57.740]  I would do them on a 12-12 cycle.
[26:57.740 --> 27:02.900]  Honestly, I had run a crop in a 5x5 tent.
[27:02.900 --> 27:07.020]  They used to make a reflector called the Grozilla and it would hold two bulbs.
[27:07.020 --> 27:12.860]  I put a 600 and a 400 in there and I ran those just like a 1000 watt light.
[27:12.860 --> 27:19.500]  That was some of the tastiest, most photogenic, densest, best, most dense.
[27:19.500 --> 27:24.020]  Some of the best weed I ever grew came from that 5x5 with those two bulbs running side
[27:24.020 --> 27:25.260]  by side.
[27:25.260 --> 27:29.980]  In your situation and in your environment, I do believe that the 400 and the 600 would
[27:29.980 --> 27:35.980]  be better because it's such a small environment that you don't need the super penetration
[27:35.980 --> 27:37.340]  from the 1000 watt.
[27:37.340 --> 27:39.020]  You want the spread from the two bulbs.
[27:39.020 --> 27:42.780]  Imagine if you've got one light source, you get more shadows.
[27:42.780 --> 27:48.060]  If you've got two bulbs, you have two light sources and less shadows and more light spread.
[27:48.060 --> 27:51.420]  One section is getting a bunch of HPS, one section is getting a bunch of metal halide,
[27:51.420 --> 27:53.060]  but you'll get more light spread.
[27:53.060 --> 27:56.780]  We're not going super deep because your ceiling is only 6.5 feet tall.
[27:56.780 --> 27:59.860]  You've only got very little penetration to try to get there.
[27:59.860 --> 28:02.340]  I would do the 600 and the 400.
[28:02.340 --> 28:05.100]  Honestly, that is what I would do in that situation.
[28:05.100 --> 28:09.500]  If you can make the 400 a metal halide, that would be totally ideal for you.
[28:09.500 --> 28:12.340]  That halide will definitely reduce the amount of stretch.
[28:12.340 --> 28:14.920]  That may help you with your stretch situation.
[28:14.920 --> 28:20.260]  If you can switch both of those bulbs to metal halides until 21 days into flower, then switch
[28:20.340 --> 28:23.620]  the big one out to the red bulb, the high pressure sodium.
[28:23.620 --> 28:25.260]  That should make it bang for you, bro.
[28:25.260 --> 28:28.060]  That should definitely give you some progress.
[28:28.060 --> 28:29.060]  It goes on.
[28:29.060 --> 28:33.700]  It says, I know you have an insane amount of inside information on this specific topic,
[28:33.700 --> 28:37.520]  but I do understand that you get thousands of questions per day and may not have time
[28:37.520 --> 28:38.520]  for this question.
[28:38.520 --> 28:41.660]  You guys, I do get a lot of emails and a lot of questions.
[28:41.660 --> 28:47.900]  I really do try to get anything that I feel like is useful for the show that a lot of
[28:47.900 --> 28:49.100]  people can gain knowledge from.
[28:49.100 --> 28:51.740]  I try to get those on the show as soon as possible.
[28:51.740 --> 28:55.820]  Don't ever feel discouraged if I don't answer your questions right away.
[28:55.820 --> 28:57.500]  This person said I get thousands of messages.
[28:57.500 --> 29:00.300]  I've got 4,000 unread emails.
[29:00.300 --> 29:02.740]  I'll try to read a lot of them over the next couple of days.
[29:02.740 --> 29:03.740]  Guess what?
[29:03.740 --> 29:06.500]  When I reply, I'll get 4,000 replies.
[29:06.500 --> 29:07.500]  I'm trying.
[29:07.500 --> 29:08.660]  I'm doing my best.
[29:08.660 --> 29:10.340]  It's just me.
[29:10.340 --> 29:15.540]  The show is written, produced, hosted, edited, burped into the microphone, all just by me.
[29:15.540 --> 29:16.940]  Excuse me for the kombucha burp there.
[29:16.940 --> 29:18.220]  I do apologize for that.
[29:18.340 --> 29:19.340]  It's all just me.
[29:19.340 --> 29:23.020]  I'm doing my best to get all the questions answered, all the material covered.
[29:23.020 --> 29:24.020]  Don't feel discouraged.
[29:24.020 --> 29:27.300]  Don't get upset if you've sent me a question and I have not answered it.
[29:27.300 --> 29:30.020]  Maybe I'm compiling your question for the appropriate episode.
[29:30.020 --> 29:32.900]  Maybe two or three other people had a similar question.
[29:32.900 --> 29:35.200]  I'm going to knock them out all at once.
[29:35.200 --> 29:38.620]  Maybe it's just not time for that question or maybe it just didn't fit the format of
[29:38.620 --> 29:39.620]  the show.
[29:39.620 --> 29:40.620]  I do apologize.
[29:40.620 --> 29:41.620]  I do my best, you guys.
[29:41.620 --> 29:42.940]  I'm going to quit rambling about that.
[29:42.940 --> 29:45.860]  That's enough excuse time with Rasta Jeff.
[29:45.860 --> 29:47.660]  Thank you for sending me the great question, my dude, JH.
[29:48.100 --> 29:49.220]  I had a good time rambling about this one.
[29:49.220 --> 29:50.700]  I hope people learned some stuff out there.
[29:50.700 --> 29:54.260]  I hope we help people mitigate the stretch.
[29:54.260 --> 29:56.660]  Also pay attention when you're buying seeds.
[29:56.660 --> 29:57.660]  That's a very important part.
[29:57.660 --> 30:00.900]  A lot of the breeders, at least myself, I try to warn you that you're going to get double
[30:00.900 --> 30:03.460]  or triple the stretch in a pack of seeds.
[30:03.460 --> 30:05.960]  Try to read that when you're shopping and buying stuff.
[30:05.960 --> 30:08.340]  That may give you a big advantage.
[30:08.340 --> 30:11.620]  Then it says, why not LED for me, which is a great question.
[30:11.620 --> 30:15.820]  It says money and, and then it goes on to say, in my research, there aren't many options
[30:15.900 --> 30:21.180]  for LED that truly outperform HBS and anything larger than a four by four configuration.
[30:21.180 --> 30:28.380]  There are a couple, but they are super expensive and they run 650 to 800 watts anyway.
[30:28.380 --> 30:29.380]  I kind of agree with you.
[30:29.380 --> 30:34.220]  It seems like all the LEDs are designed for little tiny spaces and you got to buy a lot
[30:34.220 --> 30:38.140]  of them and they are super expensive to buy those lights at the beginning.
[30:38.140 --> 30:39.980]  The upfront cost is expensive.
[30:39.980 --> 30:44.620]  Of course, you save money on air conditioning, electricity bill, but that initial investment
[30:44.620 --> 30:46.740]  does set you back a little bit.
[30:46.740 --> 30:52.540]  My opinion is that if HBS lights are working for you, metal halides are working for you
[30:52.540 --> 30:58.000]  and you're not, you don't find the LED that works for you, do your thing.
[30:58.000 --> 31:02.100]  The beauty of running your own grow, the beauty of growing cannabis in your own environment
[31:02.100 --> 31:03.500]  is that it is yours.
[31:03.500 --> 31:05.480]  You can do what makes you happy.
[31:05.480 --> 31:09.860]  As long as you are satisfied with the outcome of your product, nobody should tell you otherwise.
[31:09.860 --> 31:14.540]  As long as you're not hurting anybody, contaminating anything, poisoning anybody, or putting anybody
[31:14.660 --> 31:17.780]  in clear and present danger, do your thing, bro.
[31:17.780 --> 31:19.100]  Grow the way that you want to.
[31:19.100 --> 31:22.020]  Grow from your heart, breed with love, and don't let the haters sway you.
[31:22.020 --> 31:25.420]  If somebody's telling you something that you're doing is wrong and you're happy with the way
[31:25.420 --> 31:27.560]  you're doing it, keep doing it.
[31:27.560 --> 31:32.300]  Let yourself be open to suggestions and have room for improvement, but don't let the internet
[31:32.300 --> 31:35.260]  haters mess up your game, your strategy.
[31:35.260 --> 31:37.980]  Everybody on the internet wants to say, you're doing this wrong, you got to do this, but
[31:37.980 --> 31:39.180]  they don't even know what you're doing.
[31:39.180 --> 31:41.900]  They don't know the rest of your project, so don't let them fuck you up.
[31:41.900 --> 31:44.660]  Do your thing, grow with the lights that work best for you.
[31:44.660 --> 31:49.540]  I found that in the winter, my LED lights do not keep my grow room warm.
[31:49.540 --> 31:53.220]  I found that in the summer, those LED lights are awesome because I can take down those
[31:53.220 --> 31:56.540]  HBS lights and not have to run half the amount of air conditioning.
[31:56.540 --> 31:59.220]  It's all about the environment, the space, the time.
[31:59.220 --> 32:01.260]  Most importantly, what works for you.
[32:01.260 --> 32:03.440]  People always ask, what is the best?
[32:03.440 --> 32:06.180]  The best is what works the best for you.
[32:06.180 --> 32:10.380]  I think that ... I don't even have the best because I have to change things.
[32:10.380 --> 32:14.580]  I think that LEDs are the best in the summer, and I think that HBSs are the best in the
[32:14.580 --> 32:15.580]  winter.
[32:15.580 --> 32:19.780]  You may think something totally different because your grow room is totally different.
[32:19.780 --> 32:23.580]  Do your thing, find what works best for you, adjust and adapt.
[32:23.580 --> 32:28.100]  I like that my friend here said he's done a lot of research.
[32:28.100 --> 32:29.900]  In my research, there aren't many options.
[32:29.900 --> 32:33.960]  I love it because not enough people do enough research out there.
[32:33.960 --> 32:37.160]  My friend JH, I want to thank you once again for a great question.

[32:52.800 --> 32:55.000]  help a lot of other people out there.
