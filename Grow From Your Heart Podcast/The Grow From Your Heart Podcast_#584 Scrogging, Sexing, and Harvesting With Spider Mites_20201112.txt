[01:02.160 --> 01:06.160]  You know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:06.160 --> 01:10.160]  Today, I've been taking dabs of TKD No. 10 Live Batter.
[01:10.160 --> 01:13.160]  This is a blend of KEMD and Triangle Kush.
[01:13.160 --> 01:17.160]  On the package, the flavor is described as sour, petrol, and lemon.
[01:17.160 --> 01:21.160]  I think I agree with that, but I also would add a hint of mothballs.
[01:21.160 --> 01:28.160]  That doesn't sound pleasant, but the Kush and mothballs flavor is very delicious to a Kush consumer, a Kush connoisseur.
[01:28.160 --> 01:30.160]  I think it is delicious.
[01:30.160 --> 01:34.160]  Big shout out to the TKD No. 10 Live Batter.
[01:34.160 --> 01:37.160]  In this episode, I'm going to read a few Patreon questions.
[01:37.160 --> 01:41.160]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[01:41.160 --> 01:47.160]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month level or higher.
[01:47.160 --> 01:51.160]  So with no further ado, let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:51.160 --> 01:53.160]  Thank you. Shout out to my friend, Terp Burglar.
[01:53.160 --> 01:56.160]  Let's follow that out with a shout out to Girls Grow Too.
[01:56.160 --> 01:59.160]  I want to send a Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to Tyler Filth.
[01:59.160 --> 02:01.160]  What up, Tyler? Hope you're well, brother.
[02:01.160 --> 02:06.160]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to our friend, DTom420.
[02:06.160 --> 02:09.160]  I want to send a special thank you to Captain Mojo.
[02:09.160 --> 02:12.160]  I've always got a big shout out to A Friend With Weed.
[02:12.160 --> 02:14.160]  That's right. A Friend With Weed is a friend indeed.
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.160]  So big shout out to you, my friend.
[02:16.160 --> 02:20.160]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to another DGC member.
[02:20.160 --> 02:22.160]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Stoned Troutbum.
[02:22.160 --> 02:25.160]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to Dayron T.
[02:26.160 --> 02:32.160]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to a brand new contributor
[02:32.160 --> 02:34.160]  who is one of our overseas contributors.
[02:34.160 --> 02:37.160]  Their Patreon contribution came to me in British pounds.
[02:37.160 --> 02:38.160]  So thank you for that.
[02:38.160 --> 02:41.160]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Tartan Mike.
[02:41.160 --> 02:45.160]  Big thank you to each and every one of you for all of the Patreon support.

[02:56.160 --> 02:59.160]  All of the information you need will be right there on Patreon.
[02:59.160 --> 03:06.160]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my busy friends.
[03:06.160 --> 03:10.160]  All right. I think that covers the business portion of the podcast.
[03:10.160 --> 03:14.160]  Let's work our way into the chatter and fun part of the show.
[03:14.160 --> 03:16.160]  This is where I say thank you.
[03:16.160 --> 03:21.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, I put out an episode of a podcast with brand new equipment, brand new audio, brand new video equipment.
[03:21.160 --> 03:26.160]  I debuted debuted a bunch of new toys, showed a bunch of stuff that I've been working on.
[03:26.160 --> 03:30.160]  And my inbox was overloaded with words of encouragement.
[03:30.160 --> 03:34.160]  The YouTube comments were impressive and amazing.
[03:34.160 --> 03:36.160]  Thank you guys for all of the great feedback.
[03:36.160 --> 03:38.160]  I am overwhelmed and elated.
[03:38.160 --> 03:40.160]  See, I've been using new words on the show every day.
[03:40.160 --> 03:41.160]  Thank you, you guys.
[03:41.160 --> 03:42.160]  I do appreciate it.
[03:42.160 --> 03:44.160]  That feedback, all the words of encouragement.
[03:44.160 --> 03:46.160]  I made all the hard work worth it.
[03:46.160 --> 03:49.160]  I'm glad you guys appreciate the new sound quality, the new video quality.
[03:49.160 --> 03:51.160]  I will continue to make improvements.
[03:51.160 --> 03:55.160]  I'm also going to make improvements on the quality of the content of the show.
[03:55.160 --> 03:59.160]  So thank you for all of the feedback and the words of encouragement.
[03:59.160 --> 04:00.160]  Thank you.
[04:00.160 --> 04:01.160]  That's what I've got for that part.
[04:01.160 --> 04:03.160]  Now, I want to work into another part.
[04:03.160 --> 04:12.160]  Also, I would encourage you and invite you to please check out my new and updated and still under construction website at ireegenetics.com.
[04:12.160 --> 04:13.160]  That's right.
[04:13.160 --> 04:17.160]  All things Rasta Jeff are located at ireegenetics.com.
[04:17.160 --> 04:26.160]  If you're looking for genetics, for seeds, if you're looking for shirts, if you're looking for strain info, anything Iree Genetics, Grow From Your Heart, Rasta Jeff,
[04:26.160 --> 04:31.160]  it is all based right there at ireegenetics.com.
[04:31.160 --> 04:38.160]  Also, while I'm on that subject, we are still updating the strain pages, the genetics info, the genetics descriptions.
[04:39.160 --> 04:46.160]  There is a lot of stuff to build when it comes to updating and building a website, especially when you're a breeder that has made many, many strains, countless strains.
[04:46.160 --> 04:48.160]  I'm sure they're countable, but I haven't bothered to count them.
[04:48.160 --> 04:55.160]  There are so many that I have lost track, lost count of how many strains I have invented and created and crossed and named and whatever you want to call it.
[04:55.160 --> 04:59.160]  We are doing our best to get all of those descriptions and photos on the website.
[04:59.160 --> 05:03.160]  Here is my call to action for the folks listening to the show.
[05:04.160 --> 05:11.160]  If you have grown or are growing any Iree Genetics strains, I would appreciate your high-quality photography.
[05:11.160 --> 05:18.160]  If you've got a nice DSLR camera, I love your phone photos, but those aren't going to work for what we're trying to do.
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.160]  We need a nice quality camera, and we need some good set photos.
[05:22.160 --> 05:31.160]  If you've got any high-quality photos, please send them to me at either ireegenetics at hotmail.com or growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[05:31.160 --> 05:35.160]  You do have the opportunity to get your photos featured on my new website.
[05:35.160 --> 05:38.160]  I would love to post and feature your amazing photos.
[05:38.160 --> 05:44.160]  Even if I don't feature them on the website, I may still post them to social media, so send me all of your info.
[05:44.160 --> 05:48.160]  If you want social media credit, if you don't want credit, let me know. We'll give you some credit.
[05:48.160 --> 05:52.160]  Also, you may receive gifts and prizes in return.
[05:52.160 --> 05:58.160]  If I'm impressed with your photos and I use them, of course, you will get something in return for me using your photos.
[05:58.160 --> 06:02.160]  You may get something even if I don't use it just because I'm impressed and we didn't have a spot for your photo.
[06:02.160 --> 06:10.160]  So send those photos to me, you guys, ireegenetics at hotmail.com or growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[06:10.160 --> 06:15.160]  I will use them on my social media and my website, and you will be well rewarded.
[06:15.160 --> 06:18.160]  All right, that covers all of the business portion of the show.
[06:18.160 --> 06:22.160]  Let's get to the Patreon question part of the podcast.
[06:22.160 --> 06:26.160]  This one comes from our friend. It says, can we use their name?
[06:26.160 --> 06:30.160]  Yes, it comes from Riley, and the message goes just like this.
[06:30.160 --> 06:36.160]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, my name is Riley. I'm in Illinois, so feel free to use my name.
[06:36.160 --> 06:39.160]  That makes it nice and easy. What's up, Riley? Good to meet you. I hope you're doing well.
[06:39.160 --> 06:46.160]  It goes on to say, I have a crop which I'm about to harvest, and I have spider mites in the garden.
[06:46.160 --> 06:50.160]  That's a bummer, but there is a way to beat this. There is a way to solve this problem.
[06:50.160 --> 06:55.160]  Actually, what you really need to do is cure the problem and then solve the problem so you don't have mites in the future.
[06:55.160 --> 06:59.160]  That's a whole other rant, but let's talk about the current crop because that's what you're focused on.
[06:59.160 --> 07:04.160]  It says, I've been able to keep them at bay using Dr. Zimes, so they have not webbed.
[07:04.160 --> 07:06.160]  Man, you've really got them if you're worried about them webbing.
[07:06.160 --> 07:11.160]  Usually, you just see a little bit of pistilling and marking. They're in there thick if you're concerned with webs.
[07:11.160 --> 07:15.160]  It goes on to say, but I'm curious if you have any advice as to how I can save my buds
[07:15.160 --> 07:19.160]  and get them in the best shape during and after harvest.
[07:19.160 --> 07:23.160]  I'm not sure how long the mites will continue to live off of the plant once it is chopped,
[07:23.160 --> 07:28.160]  but I really don't want these buds to be covered in webs and become useless.
[07:28.160 --> 07:31.160]  Yes, that is a very reasonable hope or reasonable want.
[07:31.160 --> 07:34.160]  You spent a long time growing them. It is almost harvest time.
[07:34.160 --> 07:38.160]  You've got at least 12 or 13 weeks. It's time to chop. You don't want them to become useless.
[07:38.160 --> 07:43.160]  It wraps up with, I love the show and I appreciate all that you do. Thanks from Riley.
[07:43.160 --> 07:47.160]  Thanks for listening, Riley. I appreciate your message and I appreciate you for watching and listening.
[07:47.160 --> 07:53.160]  Now, let's talk a little bit about harvesting a crop that is infested with spider mites.
[07:53.160 --> 07:56.160]  It sounds like a nightmare. It sounds like everything should be over.
[07:56.160 --> 07:58.160]  A lot of people are going to say, kill it with fire.
[07:58.160 --> 08:03.160]  I come from a commercial cultivation environment where kill it with fire means that you just burnt down your job.
[08:03.160 --> 08:06.160]  So there's got to be a resolution. There's got to be a solution.
[08:06.160 --> 08:10.160]  Here is the best solution I can come up with for you.
[08:10.160 --> 08:14.160]  Earlier in the episode, not in this episode, let me say that better.
[08:14.160 --> 08:19.160]  In a previous episode, I talked about some products called Xerotol and hydrogen peroxide.
[08:19.160 --> 08:22.160]  I do not like to spray things on my plants while they are in flower.
[08:22.160 --> 08:26.160]  But if you want to rinse off those spider mites, if you want to rinse off those webs,
[08:26.160 --> 08:36.160]  if you want to rinse off the spider mite poop, you can use hydrogen peroxide or Xerotol at somewhere between 50 and 30 milliliters per gallon of water
[08:36.160 --> 08:40.160]  and just hose those plants right off. It'll knock the mites off. It'll knock the eggs right off.
[08:40.160 --> 08:44.160]  It'll dissolve any eggs that are left on there. It will kind of mitigate your problem.
[08:44.160 --> 08:46.160]  It'll definitely get rid of the webbing.
[08:46.160 --> 08:51.160]  You can also spray just plain water. Just get in there and hit them with clean water.
[08:51.160 --> 08:53.160]  People are going to say, don't get your big chunky buds wet.
[08:53.160 --> 08:56.160]  We're not going to hose them down. We're not spraying them super heavily.
[08:56.160 --> 08:59.160]  We're just going to mist them and knock off those bugs.
[08:59.160 --> 09:01.160]  You just want to kind of hose them down a little bit.
[09:01.160 --> 09:03.160]  Don't drench them. Don't saturate the buds. They're kind of spongy.
[09:03.160 --> 09:05.160]  Don't get in there and do that. Spray them.
[09:05.160 --> 09:09.160]  The bubbles are going to knock off the water in the bubbles and the impact are going to knock off the bugs.
[09:09.160 --> 09:12.160]  Then you can let them dry and they will be just fine.
[09:12.160 --> 09:16.160]  Do not saturate them. Okay. Don't saturate them. Don't over spray them.
[09:16.160 --> 09:20.160]  So knock off the bugs. You can use a Xerotol or hydrogen peroxide spray,
[09:20.160 --> 09:23.160]  or you can hit it with just straight water. Spray them off.
[09:23.160 --> 09:27.160]  Then defoliate. Get rid of all those big leaves before you even harvest.
[09:27.160 --> 09:29.160]  Cut all those big leaves off. Get them out of the room.
[09:29.160 --> 09:34.160]  You are minimizing the presence of spider mites, webs, and eggs at this time.
[09:34.160 --> 09:39.160]  So we have hosed them down. Don't go soaking them until they are super saturated.
[09:39.160 --> 09:43.160]  You guys, and they get rained on. Okay. They're going to be okay because they get rained on outside.
[09:43.160 --> 09:46.160]  It's naturally how it would happen. Make sure you've got some airflow.
[09:46.160 --> 09:49.160]  Be preventative. Use your brain. Don't get too much humidity in there.
[09:49.160 --> 09:52.160]  Don't create a big humidity spike and cause a problem right at the end.
[09:52.160 --> 09:56.160]  You can spray them lightly. You can hose them down. Put it on a high pressure.
[09:56.160 --> 09:58.160]  Don't use a lot of water. This will work.
[09:58.160 --> 10:00.160]  Then what we're going to do, we're going to defoliate.
[10:00.160 --> 10:02.160]  We're going to clean them up the best we can.
[10:02.160 --> 10:06.160]  Before you go into any other grow space, change clothes, clean yourself up, sanitize.
[10:06.160 --> 10:08.160]  But let's stay focused on this part.
[10:08.160 --> 10:11.160]  We want to clean up these plants. Then let's cut them down.
[10:11.160 --> 10:15.160]  When you cut them down, I would recommend cutting the whole plant down in one big move.
[10:15.160 --> 10:17.160]  Right where the plant is coming out of the dirt.
[10:17.160 --> 10:20.160]  Say my MacBook here is the dirt right where the stalk is coming out.
[10:20.160 --> 10:22.160]  You want to cut it right at the dirt.
[10:22.160 --> 10:26.160]  Now we've just got that long branch. Then hang it upside down.
[10:26.160 --> 10:31.160]  That branch that is sticking up is going to expose a nice moist wound.
[10:31.160 --> 10:35.160]  It's like you just took it. You literally just took scissors and cut that plant open.
[10:35.160 --> 10:39.160]  Those spider mites are after the juices inside of your leaves.
[10:39.160 --> 10:42.160]  That's what they're eating. They're biting. They're penetrating the leaf.
[10:42.160 --> 10:45.160]  They're getting the juices and they're draining your plant of its life juice.
[10:45.160 --> 10:50.160]  Guess what we just did? We just opened up the life juice buffet at the end of that stick.
[10:50.160 --> 10:54.160]  It is open. It's flowing. It's basically plant blood oozing out of there.
[10:54.160 --> 10:58.160]  If that was a human that it happened to, they need major medical attention.
[10:58.160 --> 11:01.160]  We're going to hang the plant upside down as soon as we cut it.
[11:01.160 --> 11:03.160]  Now here's what's going to happen.
[11:03.160 --> 11:08.160]  Most of those spider mites that are present are going to scramble right up to the top of those buds.
[11:08.160 --> 11:10.160]  They're just going to go, hey, I want to go to the top of those plants.
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.160]  They're going to go upward. Spider mites have a natural instinct to go upward.
[11:14.160 --> 11:18.160]  They want to get to the top of the bud so that the wind will catch them.
[11:18.160 --> 11:20.160]  They can start making a web on this bud.
[11:20.160 --> 11:23.160]  The wind will blow them over to this bud and that's how they start making their webs.
[11:23.160 --> 11:25.160]  Then the wind will come again and blow them over here.
[11:25.160 --> 11:27.160]  Now they've got a little trapeze of webs going on.
[11:27.160 --> 11:29.160]  They make the little webbing area. That is their goal.
[11:29.160 --> 11:31.160]  They want to go up to the top.
[11:31.160 --> 11:35.160]  Also, they smell that yummy fresh cut, that plant blood.
[11:35.160 --> 11:36.160]  They're like fucking sharks in the water.
[11:36.160 --> 11:37.160]  They're like, I smell it.
[11:37.160 --> 11:39.160]  They start running up to the tip of that stick.
[11:39.160 --> 11:42.160]  They all will congregate right there at the end of that stick.
[11:42.160 --> 11:44.160]  They're all going to gather right at the top.
[11:44.160 --> 11:48.160]  You've got a couple of options and these are going to sound like crazy options.
[11:48.160 --> 11:50.160]  Your first option, leave some of that stick.
[11:50.160 --> 11:53.160]  When you cut them down, the reason I told you to make that stick long,
[11:53.160 --> 11:54.160]  now we can just cut some of it off.
[11:54.160 --> 11:57.160]  Cut two or three inches of that stick off and throw it away.
[11:57.160 --> 11:59.160]  Burn it with fire. Get it away.
[11:59.160 --> 12:00.160]  That's where all the spider mites have congregated.
[12:00.160 --> 12:03.160]  You just made a motel up there. Cut the hotel off. Remove it.
[12:03.160 --> 12:08.160]  Repeat that process a couple of times and you'll get most of the mites up there to the top.
[12:08.160 --> 12:10.160]  When you cut it, you made a fresh new cut.
[12:10.160 --> 12:12.160]  More plant juices are exposed.
[12:12.160 --> 12:14.160]  Those bugs are going to keep running on up there.
[12:14.160 --> 12:16.160]  Here is another crazy idea.
[12:16.160 --> 12:18.160]  I've done it. Mike has done it.
[12:18.160 --> 12:19.160]  We've seen it in action.
[12:19.160 --> 12:21.160]  Shout out to Ernie. Ernie still does it.
[12:21.160 --> 12:24.160]  Here is a way to get rid of those spider mites that have climbed to the top.
[12:24.160 --> 12:27.160]  Take the dab torch to work and just fucking hit them with the dab torch.
[12:27.160 --> 12:29.160]  Be careful. Don't burn down the building.
[12:29.160 --> 12:30.160]  They're in your personal grow.
[12:30.160 --> 12:32.160]  They're not in the commercial grow.
[12:32.160 --> 12:33.160]  I said take it to work.
[12:33.160 --> 12:35.160]  Take it in there in your personal grow, wherever they're hanging.
[12:35.160 --> 12:38.160]  Put the dab torch on and just fucking poot, poot.
[12:38.160 --> 12:40.160]  Those fucking, excuse me for that,
[12:40.160 --> 12:44.160]  those fucking spider mites and spider mite eggs will be gone in no time.
[12:44.160 --> 12:46.160]  It's going to stink like shit in there,
[12:46.160 --> 12:49.160]  but it's better than having spider mites in your fresh cut buds.
[12:49.160 --> 12:54.160]  So defoliate, spray, defoliate, chop them down, hang them upside down,
[12:54.160 --> 12:56.160]  and watch those spider mites run up to the top.
[12:56.160 --> 12:58.160]  As they run up to the top, get rid of them.
[12:58.160 --> 13:01.160]  Either, I think that's the word I'm going for,
[13:01.160 --> 13:06.160]  either with fire or by cutting that tip off of there and removing that from the grow.
[13:06.160 --> 13:08.160]  Now there is one more thing we can think about.
[13:08.160 --> 13:10.160]  If your buds are covered in spider mites,
[13:10.160 --> 13:13.160]  if your buds have got mite eggs and mite shit on them,
[13:13.160 --> 13:16.160]  and it is visible, if you can see the spider mites running around,
[13:16.160 --> 13:18.160]  you may consider a drench.
[13:18.160 --> 13:22.160]  I mentioned spraying the plants with hydrogen peroxide or Xerotol.
[13:22.160 --> 13:26.160]  What is stopping you from cutting those plants into smaller pieces
[13:26.160 --> 13:29.160]  and dunking them before we hang them up?
[13:29.160 --> 13:32.160]  So we can cut them down, cut them into a little bit smaller pieces,
[13:32.160 --> 13:36.160]  dunk them in a hydrogen peroxide or Xerotol solution,
[13:36.160 --> 13:40.160]  and that will wash off all those bugs, all the mites, all the spider mite shit,
[13:40.160 --> 13:42.160]  and then you can hang them up and they will dry.
[13:42.160 --> 13:45.160]  And if there are any bugs left, those bugs will still run up to the top
[13:45.160 --> 13:49.160]  and you still get to burn them with the torch because that does sound like a lot of fun.
[13:49.160 --> 13:54.160]  So one of your options is to defoliate, spray them, cut them down.
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.160]  Right after you cut them down, while they are still juicy and wet,
[13:58.160 --> 14:00.160]  get a 5-gallon bucket, fill it with water,
[14:00.160 --> 14:07.160]  and put 15 to 30 milliliters of 30% hydrogen peroxide or Xerotol in there
[14:07.160 --> 14:10.160]  and just put them in there and swirl the shit out of it,
[14:10.160 --> 14:13.160]  then take it out and hang them up in an area that is well ventilated.
[14:13.160 --> 14:15.160]  You don't want to fan right on the buds.
[14:15.160 --> 14:19.160]  You want them to drip dry and dry slowly, normally like they would.
[14:19.160 --> 14:24.160]  But that is an option to help you get rid of your spider mites and your spider mite eggs
[14:24.160 --> 14:27.160]  and possibly spider mite webbing that are in your plants.
[14:27.160 --> 14:30.160]  Don't be afraid to just drench them, shake them in there, dunk them,
[14:30.160 --> 14:34.160]  shake them around in there, pull them out, let them dry, let them hang dry naturally.
[14:34.160 --> 14:36.160]  Don't keep it too wet or too moist in that room.
[14:36.160 --> 14:39.160]  Get that room about 40 to 60% relative humidity.
[14:40.160 --> 14:43.160]  About 60, 65 degrees in temperature would be good.
[14:43.160 --> 14:47.160]  That will help your plants dry up fairly quickly without drying them too quickly.
[14:47.160 --> 14:49.160]  We'll get rid of that excess water.
[14:49.160 --> 14:51.160]  You will prevent any mold issues.
[14:51.160 --> 14:55.160]  All right, so your options, I think your options are to spray them,
[14:55.160 --> 14:57.160]  start getting rid of the bugs, defoliate.
[14:57.160 --> 14:59.160]  That will get a lot of the bugs gone.
[14:59.160 --> 15:00.160]  Chop them down.
[15:00.160 --> 15:03.160]  Consider if you want to cut them into smaller pieces and dunk them,
[15:03.160 --> 15:06.160]  then hang them, or if you want to hang the whole plant,
[15:06.160 --> 15:09.160]  then watch the bugs move to the tips, get rid of the tips,
[15:09.160 --> 15:12.160]  burn it with fire or cut the tips off.
[15:12.160 --> 15:14.160]  Those are probably your best options.
[15:14.160 --> 15:16.160]  All right, Riley, I hope I helped you out.
[15:16.160 --> 15:19.160]  If you've got any follow-up questions, I would love to hear from you.
[15:19.160 --> 15:20.160]  You know how to reach me.
[15:20.160 --> 15:23.160]  GrowFromYourHeart at Hotmail.com.
[15:23.160 --> 15:26.160]  All right, let's keep the show moving and get right into the next episode.
[15:26.160 --> 15:31.160]  This one comes from a person who calls themself, their name is Casey,
[15:31.160 --> 15:34.160]  and their message goes a lot like this.
[15:34.160 --> 15:38.160]  It says, hi, Jeff, I learned about your podcast via the Growcast.
[15:38.160 --> 15:41.160]  Big shout-out to Jordan and the whole Growcast family.
[15:41.160 --> 15:42.160]  Big respect.
[15:42.160 --> 15:43.160]  I hope everybody's doing well.
[15:43.160 --> 15:47.160]  It goes on to say, I've been really enjoying your grow advice and other content.
[15:47.160 --> 15:48.160]  Thank you.
[15:48.160 --> 15:50.160]  I'm glad my grow advice is working for you,
[15:50.160 --> 15:53.160]  and I'm glad you're following my other content.
[15:53.160 --> 15:56.160]  I wonder if that is the Instagram live or what else you're watching,
[15:56.160 --> 15:57.160]  but thank you.
[15:57.160 --> 15:58.160]  I hope it is working for you.
[15:58.160 --> 16:01.160]  It goes on to say, you said, feel free to email you with a question,
[16:01.160 --> 16:02.160]  so here it goes.
[16:02.160 --> 16:04.160]  I've purchased regular seeds for the first time,
[16:04.160 --> 16:09.160]  and I'm trying to figure out how and when to cull my males.
[16:09.160 --> 16:11.160]  All right, so a lot of people go with feminized seeds,
[16:11.160 --> 16:14.160]  and then they're afraid to get regular seeds because they know they've got to
[16:14.160 --> 16:15.160]  get rid of those males.
[16:15.160 --> 16:18.160]  It sounds like our friend Casey here has taken the plunge,
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.160]  and now they're concerned as to when to pull the males out and how to identify
[16:23.160 --> 16:24.160]  them.
[16:24.160 --> 16:26.160]  So it goes on to say, I'm growing in a single 4x4 tent,
[16:26.160 --> 16:30.160]  which I use for both veg and flour, so that limits our options.
[16:30.160 --> 16:33.160]  Then it says, I prefer the scrog method for plant training.
[16:33.160 --> 16:36.160]  However, I already see where the problem is going to arise here.
[16:36.160 --> 16:37.160]  However,
[16:37.160 --> 16:41.160]  I typically begin scrogging during the mid veg stage,
[16:41.160 --> 16:45.160]  and I'm assuming I won't be able to identify the sex until very late in veg
[16:45.160 --> 16:46.160]  or early flour.
[16:46.160 --> 16:50.160]  I obviously don't want to scrog all of my plants and then try to untangle and
[16:50.160 --> 16:54.160]  remove a bunch of males after they have grown into the scrog netting.
[16:54.160 --> 16:58.160]  Any advice you can provide on how to best resolve this issue would be greatly
[16:58.160 --> 16:59.160]  appreciated.
[16:59.160 --> 17:02.160]  Thanks for the great work you do from Casey.
[17:02.160 --> 17:04.160]  All right, Casey, I've got some advice for you,
[17:04.160 --> 17:07.160]  but first let's talk a little bit about scrogging to make sure everybody
[17:07.160 --> 17:09.160]  following along is keeping up.
[17:09.160 --> 17:14.160]  So when we scrog a plant, that means screen of green.
[17:14.160 --> 17:17.160]  S-C-R-O-G is short for screen of green.
[17:17.160 --> 17:20.160]  We're going to put a screen above the canopy of the plants.
[17:20.160 --> 17:25.160]  As the plants grow into that screen, instead of letting them grow up into the
[17:25.160 --> 17:27.160]  light, we bend them toward they go horizontal.
[17:27.160 --> 17:29.160]  Now, instead of my arm going straight up,
[17:29.160 --> 17:32.160]  we put some netting here and we've just manipulated the branch under the
[17:32.160 --> 17:35.160]  netting to where it turns at a 90 degree or a shorter angle.
[17:35.160 --> 17:37.160]  And then instead of going straight up into the light,
[17:37.160 --> 17:42.160]  we can fill this horizontal space with bud space with branching and then let
[17:42.160 --> 17:43.160]  it grow from there.
[17:43.160 --> 17:44.160]  It'll grow up.
[17:44.160 --> 17:47.160]  So you make the branches bend and the shoots start growing up out of it.
[17:47.160 --> 17:49.160]  You can get a lot more space.
[17:49.160 --> 17:51.160]  You can get a lot more buds per space.
[17:51.160 --> 17:54.160]  You don't need to use a bunch of sticks to support everything.
[17:54.160 --> 17:57.160]  So that is scrogging and what the purpose of scrogging is,
[17:57.160 --> 17:59.160]  but it's got to be done before flower.
[17:59.160 --> 18:00.160]  It's got to be done.
[18:00.160 --> 18:03.160]  Generally it should be done mid veg, late veg, depending on your goal.
[18:03.160 --> 18:06.160]  But by the time you're in flower, it is too late to scrog.
[18:06.160 --> 18:08.160]  You don't want to be bending and manipulating the plants at that point.
[18:08.160 --> 18:10.160]  You're letting them focus on flowering.
[18:10.160 --> 18:14.160]  So our friend here has got some regular seeds and they want to put them in
[18:14.160 --> 18:15.160]  their tent,
[18:15.160 --> 18:18.160]  but they obviously don't want to work them into a scrog net because once they
[18:18.160 --> 18:21.160]  identify the males in flower, they've got to cut them out.
[18:22.160 --> 18:24.160]  And the point of the scrog is to fill that grow space.
[18:24.160 --> 18:25.160]  And if you're cutting shit out,
[18:25.160 --> 18:28.160]  you've just defeated the entire purpose of the scrog.
[18:28.160 --> 18:31.160]  So our friend Casey is on the exact right path.
[18:31.160 --> 18:32.160]  What do I do?
[18:32.160 --> 18:38.160]  How do I identify the male plants in my grow before I put this scrog net up?
[18:38.160 --> 18:39.160]  That is a great question.
[18:39.160 --> 18:42.160]  You've got a few options for sexing your plants.
[18:42.160 --> 18:43.160]  Unfortunately,
[18:43.160 --> 18:47.160]  you have only got one space, which highly minimizes our options.
[18:47.160 --> 18:49.160]  If you've only got one space,
[18:49.160 --> 18:51.160]  here is what I think I would do.
[18:51.160 --> 18:54.160]  I would start all of the seeds you wish to grow.
[18:54.160 --> 19:00.160]  Keep in mind that about 40 to 60% of them will be males and will be removed.
[19:00.160 --> 19:03.160]  So if you want to grow five plants, plant 10 or 12,
[19:03.160 --> 19:07.160]  if you want to grow 10, plant 20 or 24 ish.
[19:07.160 --> 19:10.160]  And then when it comes time to get down to the number that fit in there,
[19:10.160 --> 19:11.160]  pick your favorites.
[19:11.160 --> 19:13.160]  Hopefully you didn't lose too many males,
[19:13.160 --> 19:15.160]  but if you've got one or two extras, that's fine.
[19:15.160 --> 19:17.160]  Call them and just use your favorite plants.
[19:17.160 --> 19:18.160]  You don't have to use all of them.
[19:18.160 --> 19:20.160]  Pick your favorite plants out of there.
[19:20.160 --> 19:24.160]  So pick the appropriate amount of seeds, which you choose to germinate,
[19:24.160 --> 19:27.160]  germinate those seeds, get them growing, get them in.
[19:27.160 --> 19:30.160]  Tell there about, I don't know, six, seven inches tall.
[19:30.160 --> 19:32.160]  I guess that's about six or seven inches tall.
[19:32.160 --> 19:34.160]  You want just a couple of sets of leaves on there.
[19:34.160 --> 19:36.160]  Maybe a couple of nodes growing out.
[19:36.160 --> 19:38.160]  You don't want a whole lot of growth on these plants.
[19:38.160 --> 19:42.160]  Then since they're a little tiny plants and you've only got one space,
[19:42.160 --> 19:44.160]  what we're going to do is put them into flower.
[19:44.160 --> 19:46.160]  What I know we're going to put them into flower for a while.
[19:46.160 --> 19:51.160]  We're going to put them into flower for about 10 to 12 days, about nine, 10,
[19:51.160 --> 19:53.160]  11 or 12 days into this flowering process.
[19:53.160 --> 19:55.160]  These plants are going to show you their sex.
[19:55.160 --> 19:57.160]  They'll show you if they're male or female.
[19:57.160 --> 20:01.160]  They're going to show you just little, little, little hairs growing out of there.
[20:01.160 --> 20:03.160]  We don't want to call them hairs, but that's what you're going to see.
[20:03.160 --> 20:06.160]  Just little hairs giving you a peace sign, or you're going to see little nubs.
[20:06.160 --> 20:10.160]  Those little nubs will start to become balls, which will show you it's a male plant.
[20:10.160 --> 20:13.160]  So about nine, 10, usually by day 14,
[20:13.160 --> 20:16.160]  we can certainly tell if we've got male or female plants.
[20:16.160 --> 20:20.160]  As soon as we identified the males and females, guess what we got to do next?
[20:20.160 --> 20:25.160]  Pull all the males out of there and then put the plants back on an 18,
[20:25.160 --> 20:27.160]  six or 24 hour light cycle.
[20:27.160 --> 20:30.160]  This will put the plants back into veg.
[20:30.160 --> 20:34.160]  They will go back into a vegetative stage and they will continue growing and
[20:34.160 --> 20:38.160]  getting bigger and ready for the flowering cycle while they're doing this.
[20:38.160 --> 20:42.160]  If you don't go too far into flower, it is very easy to revert them.
[20:42.160 --> 20:47.160]  Just put your light back on 18, six or 24 hours and they will revert.
[20:47.160 --> 20:50.160]  If you waited too long, it'll take longer. If you identify sex early,
[20:50.160 --> 20:52.160]  it won't take as long.
[20:52.160 --> 20:55.160]  So just wait until you've identified sex on every plant.
[20:55.160 --> 20:57.160]  As soon as you've pulled out all the boys,
[20:57.160 --> 21:01.160]  put it back on 18, six or 24 hours and they will begin vegging again.
[21:01.160 --> 21:05.160]  Then pot them into their next big pots, veg them up, get them in the scrog,
[21:05.160 --> 21:08.160]  run them business as usual. You've got all the boys out of there.
[21:08.160 --> 21:10.160]  Now you're just running females.
[21:10.160 --> 21:15.160]  There are other ways to do this, but since you've only got one space,
[21:15.160 --> 21:18.160]  you're very, very limited on your options.
[21:18.160 --> 21:23.160]  Something I would think about is getting either a cloning space or another very
[21:23.160 --> 21:26.160]  small vegging space. Because what if in this pack of seeds,
[21:26.160 --> 21:29.160]  you find the most amazing plant you have ever grown?
[21:29.160 --> 21:32.160]  What if you find the plant that cures whatever ails you,
[21:32.160 --> 21:38.160]  if you've got ADD or COPD or HIV or OPP or whatever you've got,
[21:38.160 --> 21:41.160]  what if this cures it and you've only got one good run with it because you
[21:41.160 --> 21:45.160]  don't take clones? It's going to be great medicine. It'll be enjoyable,
[21:45.160 --> 21:46.160]  but you're always going to say, man,
[21:46.160 --> 21:49.160]  I really wish I had a clone of that one strain that got away from me because I
[21:49.160 --> 21:51.160]  never kept a clone of it.
[21:51.160 --> 21:54.160]  So I think the first run with the pack of seeds is kind of an audition.
[21:54.160 --> 21:56.160]  It's we do a pheno hunt.
[21:56.160 --> 22:00.160]  Every seed is going to show a little bit of variation depending on the
[22:00.160 --> 22:04.160]  breeding, uh, how far in filial generations that seed line is.
[22:04.160 --> 22:07.160]  We're likely going to see generation from seed to seed to seed.
[22:07.160 --> 22:10.160]  If you plant 10 seeds, you get five males, you pull those,
[22:10.160 --> 22:11.160]  you got five females.
[22:11.160 --> 22:14.160]  You're going to see a female that looks like the mom plant.
[22:14.160 --> 22:16.160]  You're going to see a female that looks like the dad plant.
[22:16.160 --> 22:20.160]  You're going to see a plant that is 50, 50, both genetics in the middle.
[22:20.160 --> 22:21.160]  Then you're going to see some outliers,
[22:21.160 --> 22:26.160]  some weirdos that are the rest of your genetics. So it is really,
[22:26.160 --> 22:29.160]  you're going to really wish that you had a clone because that first run is just
[22:29.160 --> 22:32.160]  an auditioning run. Do you want the one that looks like mommy?
[22:32.160 --> 22:35.160]  Do you want the one that looks like daddy? Do you want that 50, 50,
[22:35.160 --> 22:37.160]  or did you find a weirdo that is fucking perfect for you,
[22:37.160 --> 22:39.160]  but I would have thrown it away.
[22:39.160 --> 22:43.160]  So I would really consider getting a veg space or a secondary space so that
[22:43.160 --> 22:46.160]  you can find that plant that works the best for you and continue to run it
[22:46.160 --> 22:48.160]  over and over again.
[22:48.160 --> 22:52.160]  Then what will happen is you'll have medicine that works very well for you.
[22:52.160 --> 22:55.160]  And you'll develop a relationship with that one cultivar.
[22:55.160 --> 22:58.160]  We can kick ass with our first grow with the plant.
[22:58.160 --> 23:01.160]  I've got a good idea how to grow any plant pretty decently,
[23:01.160 --> 23:05.160]  but after the second, third or fourth time I grow a plant,
[23:05.160 --> 23:08.160]  you can definitely tell the quality of the finished product.
[23:08.160 --> 23:10.160]  I know that around week six,
[23:10.160 --> 23:12.160]  that plant's going to start yellowing up because I didn't give it enough
[23:12.160 --> 23:16.160]  nitrogen. Or I know that around week five, it's going to want a lot more cow mag.
[23:16.160 --> 23:20.160]  I know that I shouldn't have let it get that cold. You start learning things.
[23:20.160 --> 23:22.160]  It's like dating the plant on that first date.
[23:22.160 --> 23:24.160]  You have no idea what to expect.
[23:24.160 --> 23:26.160]  And that's kind of what you're doing when you're growing from seed.
[23:26.160 --> 23:29.160]  You get to find out, is it even a female? That's,
[23:29.160 --> 23:31.160]  that's how the first date goes. Then that second and third date,
[23:31.160 --> 23:33.160]  that's when you actually start making progress.
[23:33.160 --> 23:37.160]  So I would recommend you get yourself a clone space or a veg space and start
[23:37.160 --> 23:39.160]  keeping clones and doing a pheno hunt that way.
[23:39.160 --> 23:44.160]  I understand that that may not be possible or feasible or viable for you.
[23:44.160 --> 23:47.160]  Everybody's got their own conditions and environments and situations,
[23:47.160 --> 23:51.160]  but what if you grow the most amazing cannabis you've ever grown and you don't
[23:51.160 --> 23:54.160]  have a clone of it? If you had another space,
[23:54.160 --> 23:58.160]  what I would recommend is that you grow the plants out on till they're big
[23:58.160 --> 24:01.160]  enough to get one good clone from. I take the top right out of the plant,
[24:01.160 --> 24:02.160]  make a clone of that.
[24:02.160 --> 24:07.160]  Then I put those clones in either a clone dome or a machine and immediately put
[24:07.160 --> 24:10.160]  them under 1212. They will root while they're under 1212.
[24:10.160 --> 24:13.160]  They're rooting and telling you if they're a male or a female at the same time.
[24:13.160 --> 24:14.160]  Again,
[24:14.160 --> 24:18.160]  these clones are going to tell you in nine to 14 days if they are males or
[24:18.160 --> 24:22.160]  females, then we can call the male plant and we can call the male clone.
[24:22.160 --> 24:25.160]  Now we've only got females to work with. We can run the females.
[24:25.160 --> 24:30.160]  Now also we've got a female backup so that if we do find that magic plant in
[24:30.160 --> 24:32.160]  the mix there, I've got another copy of it.
[24:32.160 --> 24:35.160]  We don't have to throw it away and talk about that one plant that got away.
[24:35.160 --> 24:37.160]  We sit around and go, Hey, do you have any more of that one?
[24:37.160 --> 24:39.160]  Kush that was amazing. No, I don't.
[24:39.160 --> 24:42.160]  Cause I didn't take any fucking clones of it and everybody will be upset with
[24:42.160 --> 24:43.160]  you, even yourself.
[24:43.160 --> 24:47.160]  So I recommend another space and some clones that way you can do a proper
[24:47.160 --> 24:49.160]  pheno hunt. That way you can dial in the medicine.
[24:49.160 --> 24:52.160]  You can find the cultivar that works the best for yourself, your condition,
[24:53.160 --> 24:56.160]  your grow, maybe your customers. I'm not sure what you're doing.
[24:56.160 --> 24:59.160]  Then you can have a clone and provide that all the time.
[24:59.160 --> 25:02.160]  Then you can really dial it in, keep growing it, learn it, perfect it,
[25:02.160 --> 25:06.160]  make it the strain you are known for. Set yourself apart from the market.
[25:06.160 --> 25:11.160]  If it's a profitable grow or make yourself the best medicine you could possibly
[25:11.160 --> 25:14.160]  consume. I want to make sure I didn't skip any notes here because when I
[25:14.160 --> 25:16.160]  realized you only had one space,
[25:16.160 --> 25:21.160]  I did have to change my idea on how to help you out because with one space you
[25:21.160 --> 25:22.160]  can't do a lot of things.
[25:22.160 --> 25:26.160]  There is lab testing to tell you if your plants are males or females.
[25:26.160 --> 25:28.160]  You can grow them up to the way they've,
[25:28.160 --> 25:30.160]  to where they've got two or three sets of leaves.
[25:30.160 --> 25:34.160]  You can rub some tissue sample onto a little card and mail that to a
[25:34.160 --> 25:38.160]  laboratory and they will tell you which plants are males and females.
[25:38.160 --> 25:41.160]  As long as you mark plant a and plant a on the card and on the plant and plant
[25:41.160 --> 25:43.160]  B and plant B and on the card and on the plant,
[25:44.160 --> 25:47.160]  they will reliably tell you if you've got male or female plants.
[25:48.160 --> 25:52.160]  That's very helpful because I understand you don't want to scrug these plants.
[25:52.160 --> 25:55.160]  You definitely, I would not put them in the scrug. Don't do that.
[25:55.160 --> 25:57.160]  Find out if they're males or females first.
[25:57.160 --> 26:00.160]  If you guys are out there wondering if you've got male or female plants,
[26:00.160 --> 26:04.160]  there are lab tests available that will tell you way early.
[26:04.160 --> 26:07.160]  You don't have to waste all the time, space, energy, money, nutrients,
[26:07.160 --> 26:09.160]  all of the things that come with the grow.
[26:09.160 --> 26:13.160]  Let me make sure I've got everything else covered. Don't scrug them.
[26:13.160 --> 26:16.160]  You've only got one space. So your option is probably again,
[26:16.160 --> 26:20.160]  that option is probably to grow them, put them into flower for nine to 14 days,
[26:20.160 --> 26:24.160]  pull out the males. As soon as you have identified the males,
[26:24.160 --> 26:27.160]  put them back into veg, then business as usual.
[26:27.160 --> 26:29.160]  It'll take them a little bit to get back to their veg state,
[26:29.160 --> 26:32.160]  but they'll just start growing. They'll get big, they'll get robust,
[26:32.160 --> 26:34.160]  they'll get beefy. Then you scrug them out.
[26:34.160 --> 26:37.160]  Then you flower just like you did all of your other crops.
[26:37.160 --> 26:39.160]  But again, I'm going to repeat myself.
[26:39.160 --> 26:43.160]  I really encourage you to get that second space because what if you find,
[26:43.160 --> 26:46.160]  what if you find chem dog in there? What if you find golden goat in there?
[26:46.160 --> 26:51.160]  Golden goat was an accident. Chem dog came from a bag seed.
[26:51.160 --> 26:52.160]  Who knows what you've got in there.
[26:52.160 --> 26:56.160]  You may find the next gem that could be the hottest shit on the planet and you
[26:56.160 --> 26:58.160]  don't have an opportunity to take a clone of it.
[26:58.160 --> 27:01.160]  That's when we'll be learning how to re-veg and you'll be listening to the
[27:01.160 --> 27:04.160]  re-veg episode again. All right. I want to thank you for the great message.
