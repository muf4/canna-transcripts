[00:17.600 --> 00:20.240]  Happy New Year, Cannabis community.
[00:20.240 --> 00:22.100]  It's time for episode number 274
[00:22.100 --> 00:23.840]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.840 --> 00:27.480]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.480 --> 00:28.640]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.640 --> 00:29.840]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.840 --> 00:32.280]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:32.280 --> 00:33.600]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:33.600 --> 00:35.080]  or even someone who is just curious
[00:35.080 --> 00:36.900]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.900 --> 00:39.740]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.740 --> 00:41.720]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.720 --> 00:43.640]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.640 --> 00:45.760]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.760 --> 00:47.360]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:48.120 --> 00:49.760]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.760 --> 00:51.480]  Big shout out to Kat, Koo,
[00:51.480 --> 00:53.760]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.960 --> 00:57.300]  Once again, Happy New Year, everybody.
[00:57.300 --> 00:58.240]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:58.240 --> 01:01.240]  This will be the first episode I put out in 2018.
[01:02.360 --> 01:04.360]  I hope everybody had a great 2017.
[01:04.360 --> 01:05.880]  I hope your holiday season was perfect,
[01:05.880 --> 01:08.480]  and I hope you had a safe Happy New Year.
[01:08.480 --> 01:12.540]  Also, I hope 2018 brings you everything you were hoping for.
[01:14.340 --> 01:15.760]  All right, you guys, I usually like to start off
[01:15.800 --> 01:18.360]  the podcast by talking about what I've been smoking on,
[01:18.360 --> 01:21.040]  and today I've got some shit worth talking about.
[01:21.040 --> 01:23.680]  I have been dabbing on some Lemon Jeffrey Sauce,
[01:23.680 --> 01:24.720]  and it is tremendous.
[01:24.720 --> 01:25.800]  Let's talk a little bit about this.
[01:25.800 --> 01:27.480]  I'm grabbing the package to tell you about it.
[01:27.480 --> 01:29.920]  I have got some Lemon Jeffrey Sauce
[01:29.920 --> 01:32.920]  grown by our friends at Elevations in Colorado Springs,
[01:32.920 --> 01:35.760]  extracted by our friends at Mana Extracts.
[01:35.760 --> 01:38.160]  A friend of mine on Instagram actually contacted me
[01:38.160 --> 01:40.080]  and said, hey dude, you need to have some of this.
[01:40.080 --> 01:42.320]  So we made sure that he got a few grams in my hands.
[01:42.320 --> 01:44.520]  I don't know if he wants to be mentioned on the show or not.
[01:44.520 --> 01:45.520]  He knows who he is.
[01:45.520 --> 01:46.640]  Super huge shout out, bro.
[01:46.640 --> 01:47.840]  I appreciate it.
[01:47.840 --> 01:50.920]  Also, huge shout out to Elevations and Mana Extracts.
[01:50.920 --> 01:54.000]  They did a hell of a good job with this Lemon Jeffrey Sauce.
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.120]  Let's open up the jar and look at it for a second here.
[01:58.040 --> 01:59.840]  The only problem is these jars kind of suck.
[01:59.840 --> 02:00.840]  These jars get stuck.
[02:00.840 --> 02:02.480]  These childproof lids, they suck.
[02:02.480 --> 02:03.760]  It's the only thing I would complain about,
[02:03.760 --> 02:05.200]  upgrade these fucking jar lids.
[02:05.200 --> 02:07.280]  But I've got it open, let's look at it.
[02:07.280 --> 02:10.240]  The consistency is kind of like a moist cake batter
[02:10.240 --> 02:12.720]  or maybe a moist cheesecake batter.
[02:12.720 --> 02:13.720]  The color is beautiful.
[02:13.720 --> 02:15.880]  It is beautifully golden yellow.
[02:15.880 --> 02:16.720]  It is perfect.
[02:16.720 --> 02:20.400]  It's what you would think lemon candy would be the color of.
[02:20.400 --> 02:24.160]  And this jar is eight to 10 inches away from my face,
[02:24.160 --> 02:26.640]  you guys, and all I can smell is lemon candy.
[02:26.640 --> 02:29.840]  It just smells like lemon heads or lemon meringue
[02:29.840 --> 02:32.800]  or some sort of really soft lemon scented candy.
[02:32.800 --> 02:33.720]  And I really enjoy it.
[02:33.720 --> 02:35.480]  And I said soft, yeah, I know that's weird.
[02:35.480 --> 02:36.600]  I think some things have like,
[02:36.600 --> 02:39.200]  lemon pledge has a hard lemon smell.
[02:39.200 --> 02:41.160]  Lemon pledge, that smell punches you in the face
[02:41.160 --> 02:42.320]  and is pungent.
[02:42.320 --> 02:44.800]  I think lemon Jeffrey has a soft lemon smell.
[02:44.800 --> 02:47.440]  It's got like a, I don't know, it's not real abrasive.
[02:47.440 --> 02:48.840]  It coats your tongue and it's pleasing.
[02:48.840 --> 02:51.360]  It makes you go, ooh, that's soft and yummy.
[02:51.360 --> 02:54.240]  Maybe I'm crazy, but I think it's a soft lemon scent
[02:54.240 --> 02:55.080]  and I really enjoy it.
[02:55.080 --> 02:56.680]  So shout out to everybody involved in there.
[02:56.680 --> 02:57.960]  This hash is amazing.
[02:57.960 --> 02:59.280]  I've talked about the consistency.
[02:59.280 --> 03:00.120]  I talked about the color.
[03:00.120 --> 03:01.200]  I talked about the smell.
[03:01.200 --> 03:02.920]  The taste is amazing.
[03:02.920 --> 03:05.120]  It tastes like you just put,
[03:05.120 --> 03:07.280]  not the lemon head candy itself,
[03:07.280 --> 03:08.320]  because those are a little stronger
[03:08.320 --> 03:09.240]  than what this tastes like,
[03:09.240 --> 03:10.560]  but the smell of the lemon candy,
[03:10.560 --> 03:12.320]  it's like you took a bite out of that.
[03:12.320 --> 03:14.940]  Like how the lemon head box smells when you smell it.
[03:14.940 --> 03:17.960]  It smells like you dabbed that flavor and it is delicious.
[03:17.960 --> 03:20.920]  The high, obviously, is tremendous.
[03:20.920 --> 03:22.520]  It's very sativa dominant
[03:22.520 --> 03:24.200]  and I think it's got me rambling a little bit.
[03:24.200 --> 03:25.960]  So this should be a fun podcast.
[03:25.960 --> 03:27.400]  Once again, shout out to everybody involved
[03:27.400 --> 03:29.440]  in this delicious lemon Jeffrey sauce.
[03:29.440 --> 03:32.800]  Of course, the lemon Jeffrey is the lemon skunk
[03:32.800 --> 03:34.480]  pollinated by a reversed golden goat.
[03:34.480 --> 03:36.580]  Of course, I made that strain several years ago.
[03:36.580 --> 03:38.720]  It's making its way through Colorado again
[03:38.720 --> 03:40.120]  and getting very popular.
[03:41.160 --> 03:43.000]  A lot of people have been asking for more seeds
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.160]  of the lemon Jeffrey and I think that in 2018,
[03:47.160 --> 03:48.380]  that will be one of my goals.
[03:48.380 --> 03:51.000]  I think I'm going to make, no, not I think, I am.
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.440]  I am going to make more lemon Jeffrey seeds in 2018.
[03:54.440 --> 03:55.820]  So everybody that's been asking,
[03:55.820 --> 03:57.000]  there's the official announcement.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.580]  I talked about it on an Instagram live video the other day,
[03:59.580 --> 04:00.920]  but this is the official announcement.
[04:00.920 --> 04:05.120]  I will be making more lemon Jeffrey feminized seeds in 2018.
[04:05.120 --> 04:06.280]  It may not be till the summer
[04:06.280 --> 04:08.200]  because I've got other things lined up
[04:08.720 --> 04:10.640]  and I've got schedules and shit like that to go with,
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.560]  but there will be more lemon Jeffrey seeds in the future.
[04:14.560 --> 04:15.920]  And speaking of seeds in the future,
[04:15.920 --> 04:17.920]  let's talk about my breeding project.
[04:17.920 --> 04:19.060]  I like to keep you guys updated
[04:19.060 --> 04:21.360]  on a breeding project I'm working on.
[04:21.360 --> 04:23.960]  I keep telling you guys that I have got a star dog
[04:23.960 --> 04:25.960]  and a Durban poison in the breeding room
[04:25.960 --> 04:28.120]  that will get pollinated by a rise.
[04:28.120 --> 04:29.920]  There's also a platinum tangy in there.
[04:29.920 --> 04:31.520]  There's ecto cooler in there.
[04:31.520 --> 04:33.040]  There are several great females in there
[04:33.040 --> 04:34.160]  that are going to get pollinated
[04:34.160 --> 04:36.160]  or actually at this point in time,
[04:36.160 --> 04:38.420]  have been pollinated by King Solomon.
[04:38.420 --> 04:39.260]  They look great.
[04:39.260 --> 04:40.280]  The pistols have curled up.
[04:40.280 --> 04:42.480]  I can see the seeds developing.
[04:42.480 --> 04:44.140]  They're starting to get thick already.
[04:44.140 --> 04:46.360]  There's about 30 days to go in that grow
[04:46.360 --> 04:47.540]  before those seeds will be ready,
[04:47.540 --> 04:50.160]  but I can see that the pollination went well.
[04:50.160 --> 04:51.780]  I can see that the seeds are developing.
[04:51.780 --> 04:53.360]  I can see that the plants are healthy
[04:53.360 --> 04:55.080]  and I can see that this is going to be
[04:55.080 --> 04:57.680]  a successful pollen chucking run.
[04:57.680 --> 05:00.280]  So here in about 30 days from now,
[05:00.280 --> 05:02.680]  I will have new stuff that needs to be tested.
[05:02.680 --> 05:04.920]  I will have replenishings of old stuff
[05:04.920 --> 05:07.880]  so that the Helladank seed bank can get some restocks.
[05:07.880 --> 05:09.540]  They'll also get some of the new stuff.
[05:09.540 --> 05:10.480]  So stay tuned.
[05:10.480 --> 05:11.440]  New stuff is coming.
[05:11.440 --> 05:13.080]  You guys, I am really excited
[05:13.080 --> 05:14.960]  about this Stardog cross to a rise
[05:14.960 --> 05:18.400]  and I'm really excited about Durban poison cross to a rise.
[05:18.400 --> 05:19.980]  I think that those are going to have great potential.
[05:19.980 --> 05:21.620]  Those are two of my favorite strains.
[05:21.620 --> 05:24.280]  So crossing them to the arise has me really excited
[05:24.280 --> 05:25.240]  and I kind of can't wait.
[05:25.240 --> 05:26.360]  So I'll keep you guys updated.
[05:26.360 --> 05:28.680]  I'll probably talk about it on every episode
[05:28.680 --> 05:30.500]  from now until the time they come down
[05:30.500 --> 05:32.000]  and then I'll start talking about them again
[05:32.000 --> 05:33.720]  when I grow them because I really can't wait.
[05:33.720 --> 05:36.120]  So get used to hearing about those two crosses
[05:36.120 --> 05:38.240]  because I'll talk about them a lot.
[05:38.240 --> 05:39.280]  I'm also super excited
[05:39.280 --> 05:41.940]  about the platinum tangy cross to a rise.
[05:41.940 --> 05:43.280]  Just something about that,
[05:43.280 --> 05:45.080]  that orange smell when I walk in the garden,
[05:45.080 --> 05:48.320]  I can smell that platinum tangy over everything else.
[05:48.320 --> 05:50.200]  It's the platinum tangy and the cactus cooler.
[05:50.200 --> 05:53.640]  The aromas of those things just overpower everything.
[05:53.640 --> 05:57.520]  Also, there's a Leroy in there that's going to get pollinated
[05:57.520 --> 05:59.200]  and I'm making a strain for a friend
[05:59.200 --> 06:02.880]  and the Leroy to a rise will be called the Cletus
[06:02.880 --> 06:03.920]  and that's being made for a friend.
[06:03.920 --> 06:07.080]  So I don't have any plans to release the seeds
[06:07.080 --> 06:07.920]  of the Cletus.
[06:07.920 --> 06:08.880]  It's not going to go anywhere.
[06:08.880 --> 06:09.780]  It'll be in my garden.
[06:09.780 --> 06:11.520]  It'll be in my friend Cletus's garden.
[06:11.520 --> 06:13.440]  It may be in a couple other small gardens,
[06:13.440 --> 06:15.600]  but I'm really, I'm not going to make a lot of seeds.
[06:15.600 --> 06:18.280]  I expect maybe 20 to 50 seeds out of the small plant
[06:18.280 --> 06:20.440]  that I made, but the Cletus will be coming
[06:20.440 --> 06:21.600]  and it's something I'm excited about
[06:21.600 --> 06:25.300]  because it's a breeding project for a friend who moved away.
[06:25.300 --> 06:26.280]  He's not around here anymore.
[06:26.280 --> 06:28.380]  We don't get to hang out, but we still talk.
[06:28.380 --> 06:30.400]  I think it'll be fun to grow the Cletus
[06:30.400 --> 06:31.920]  for my friend Cletus.
[06:31.920 --> 06:32.760]  Shout out Cletus.
[06:32.760 --> 06:34.200]  I hope you hear this brother.
[06:34.200 --> 06:36.060]  Oh, and since we're talking about naming strains
[06:36.060 --> 06:39.520]  and new cannabis strains, the Zach Hays cross to a rise
[06:39.520 --> 06:40.880]  has an official name.
[06:40.880 --> 06:43.640]  It is now officially called Pure Love.
[06:43.640 --> 06:44.920]  The reason it's called Pure Love is
[06:44.920 --> 06:46.420]  because I was trying to come up with a name of it.
[06:46.420 --> 06:48.720]  I was sitting there thinking about my buddy Zach.
[06:48.720 --> 06:50.800]  If you don't know, Zach Hays is a cross
[06:50.800 --> 06:52.760]  that was made for my friend Zach from New Mexico
[06:52.760 --> 06:55.160]  who passed away from cystic fibrosis.
[06:55.160 --> 06:57.900]  His real name was Zach Hays.
[06:57.900 --> 07:00.720]  Some friends of ours made a strain for him called Zach Hays.
[07:00.720 --> 07:02.680]  I was gifted a Zach Hays clone.
[07:02.680 --> 07:04.040]  I did what I'm supposed to do.
[07:04.040 --> 07:06.960]  And I pollinated that Zach Hays clone with the Arise.
[07:07.920 --> 07:10.160]  I then took those seeds and I gave them back
[07:10.160 --> 07:11.680]  to our friends at Organica.
[07:11.680 --> 07:13.900]  They got almost half of all the seeds
[07:13.900 --> 07:16.160]  of the Zach Hays to Arise I produced.
[07:16.160 --> 07:18.100]  I was sitting there thinking of a name for it.
[07:18.100 --> 07:19.680]  I was looking at Zach's Facebook page
[07:19.680 --> 07:20.520]  because it's still up.
[07:20.520 --> 07:22.100]  I was looking at Zach's Instagram.
[07:22.100 --> 07:24.000]  I was trying to find a way to name this strain
[07:24.000 --> 07:25.300]  and honor Zach.
[07:25.300 --> 07:27.720]  And I was like, when I'm trying to name a strain,
[07:27.720 --> 07:29.580]  I think, why did you do this?
[07:29.580 --> 07:32.060]  And in my head I said, I did it out of pure love.
[07:32.060 --> 07:33.860]  And I said, well, fuck, that's the name of the strain.
[07:33.860 --> 07:34.820]  Pure love.
[07:34.820 --> 07:37.620]  Zach Hays to Arise is called pure love.
[07:37.620 --> 07:40.280]  I do not know if I will release the pure love strain
[07:40.280 --> 07:41.860]  in seed form to the public
[07:41.860 --> 07:43.260]  because it has not been tested yet.
[07:43.260 --> 07:45.740]  Organica has got the first batch of seeds.
[07:45.740 --> 07:46.940]  They get to grow it first.
[07:46.940 --> 07:48.420]  They're gonna test it for me.
[07:48.420 --> 07:51.460]  If they like it, if it shows that there are no harms,
[07:51.460 --> 07:53.340]  that there are no problems, that it's a quality strain,
[07:53.340 --> 07:55.420]  that it puts out good THC, that it's worth growing
[07:55.420 --> 07:56.860]  and it's worth sharing with people,
[07:56.860 --> 07:59.540]  I will consider putting it out as a public release
[08:00.380 --> 08:01.220]  for other people to grow.
[08:01.220 --> 08:02.780]  But until Organica finds their clone,
[08:02.780 --> 08:05.700]  until Organica gets done with it, it's not going anywhere.
[08:05.700 --> 08:07.580]  Myself and Organica are gonna keep it private
[08:07.580 --> 08:09.820]  because that was something made for a friend
[08:09.820 --> 08:11.580]  and then it was made even further for a friend.
[08:11.580 --> 08:12.700]  It's kind of a personal project.
[08:12.700 --> 08:15.860]  We're gonna keep it close until we've had our run with it.
[08:15.860 --> 08:18.780]  But pure love, Zach Hays to Arise.
[08:18.780 --> 08:20.060]  Big shout out to my buddy Zach.
[08:20.060 --> 08:21.380]  Miss you and I love you every day, bro.
[08:21.380 --> 08:24.300]  Also big shout out to all of our friends at Organica.
[08:24.300 --> 08:26.280]  You guys are doing a great job down there.
[08:26.280 --> 08:28.140]  If you guys keep killing it and crushing it like you are,
[08:28.140 --> 08:29.620]  I'm gonna have to come down there and pay you a visit
[08:29.620 --> 08:30.460]  and come check out the garden
[08:30.460 --> 08:32.460]  and come high five everybody and shake your hands,
[08:32.460 --> 08:34.220]  bring you some more seeds.
[08:34.220 --> 08:36.580]  All right, big shout out to everybody down at Organica.
[08:36.580 --> 08:39.260]  Big shout out to Tim, huge shout out to Zach.
[08:39.260 --> 08:41.380]  And I even wanna send a shout out to Deez Romero,
[08:41.380 --> 08:42.900]  even though you were too high to get out of the car
[08:42.900 --> 08:44.100]  and had to take a nap the last time
[08:44.100 --> 08:45.500]  you guys drove to my house.
[08:45.500 --> 08:46.340]  Big shout out, bro.
[08:46.340 --> 08:48.340]  I look forward to seeing you next time.
[08:48.340 --> 08:50.980]  I look forward to taking some big old globs with you.
[08:50.980 --> 08:52.060]  Can't wait, all right.
[08:52.060 --> 08:54.260]  Let's move forward with the podcast a little bit.
[08:54.260 --> 08:55.800]  It is the first of the year,
[08:55.800 --> 08:57.540]  so I thought it would be a good idea
[08:57.940 --> 09:00.460]  to talk about some attainable garden goals
[09:00.460 --> 09:03.760]  and ways that you can improve your garden in 2018.
[09:03.760 --> 09:05.400]  If you're not thinking of ways to improve,
[09:05.400 --> 09:07.380]  you're standing still and moving backwards.
[09:07.380 --> 09:09.820]  So let's talk about ways that we can improve our garden
[09:09.820 --> 09:13.860]  in 2018 and realistic goals that you can set for yourself
[09:13.860 --> 09:15.660]  that you would actually be able to reach
[09:15.660 --> 09:17.700]  for your garden in 2018.
[09:17.700 --> 09:20.040]  A lot of people may say, hey, I wanna grow better.
[09:20.040 --> 09:22.620]  I wanna do something better next year with my garden,
[09:22.620 --> 09:23.760]  with my life, with myself,
[09:23.760 --> 09:26.240]  but they don't know what they want to do.
[09:26.240 --> 09:29.000]  So I've thought of some goals that you can actually reach,
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.840]  some goals that are attainable.
[09:30.840 --> 09:33.460]  These are goals that any grower can reach for
[09:33.460 --> 09:35.040]  because if you're an excellent grower,
[09:35.040 --> 09:37.420]  if you're a mediocre grower, if you're a shitty grower,
[09:37.420 --> 09:39.800]  if you're an old school grower, if you're a pro grower,
[09:39.800 --> 09:41.180]  there's always room for improvement.
[09:41.180 --> 09:42.720]  And the things I'm gonna mention,
[09:42.720 --> 09:45.040]  everybody can improve on a little bit.
[09:45.040 --> 09:48.480]  So let's talk about goals you can reach
[09:48.480 --> 09:51.520]  to improve your garden in 2018.
[09:51.520 --> 09:52.960]  The first thing you can do,
[09:52.960 --> 09:54.000]  and it kind of sounds redundant
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.080]  because I've already said this.
[09:55.080 --> 09:57.680]  The first thing you can do is set some goals.
[09:57.680 --> 10:00.440]  Get out some paper, get out a dry erase board,
[10:00.440 --> 10:02.680]  get out your phone, open up a notepad,
[10:02.680 --> 10:04.600]  and actually write something down
[10:04.600 --> 10:07.640]  that will actually be a goal for 2018.
[10:07.640 --> 10:09.360]  If you don't write it down, if you just say,
[10:09.360 --> 10:12.540]  in 2018, I want to do this.
[10:12.540 --> 10:14.680]  Sure, you set it, it's out there.
[10:14.680 --> 10:16.840]  There were no witnesses, there's nothing holding you to it,
[10:16.840 --> 10:18.780]  there's nothing to remind you of that every day.
[10:18.780 --> 10:20.680]  If you've got a piece of paper sitting on your desk,
[10:20.680 --> 10:22.640]  if you've got a note on the refrigerator,
[10:22.640 --> 10:23.800]  if you've got a note in your phone
[10:23.800 --> 10:25.480]  and you see it occasionally and it says,
[10:25.480 --> 10:27.840]  in 2018, I'm going to improve this,
[10:27.840 --> 10:30.200]  it's a reminder, there's some accountability there.
[10:30.200 --> 10:32.800]  You see it, and if you stop doing it,
[10:32.800 --> 10:34.360]  you kind of feel shitty for yourself
[10:34.360 --> 10:36.680]  and bad about yourself because you have failed yourself.
[10:36.680 --> 10:38.720]  So write it down, put it on paper.
[10:38.720 --> 10:40.880]  Just say, hey, I'm going to do this.
[10:40.880 --> 10:42.520]  Even if it's just a little thing,
[10:42.520 --> 10:44.860]  and a small improvement, a small goal,
[10:44.860 --> 10:46.840]  write it down and accomplish it.
[10:46.840 --> 10:48.880]  I think I talked about this on the last episode.
[10:48.880 --> 10:51.160]  If you write down a goal, you'll accomplish it.
[10:51.160 --> 10:52.440]  And then when you accomplish that goal,
[10:52.440 --> 10:54.640]  you'll say, well shit, I've got to write down another goal.
[10:54.640 --> 10:56.360]  And then you'll write down two goals.
[10:56.360 --> 10:57.640]  And then you'll accomplish both of those
[10:57.640 --> 10:59.560]  and you'll go, shit, I can do a lot of things.
[10:59.560 --> 11:01.920]  And your goals will get bigger, your life will get better,
[11:01.920 --> 11:04.420]  and you'll start improving in so many different ways.
[11:04.420 --> 11:05.720]  You'll gain more confidence,
[11:05.720 --> 11:07.080]  you'll get a better personality,
[11:07.080 --> 11:08.080]  you'll get a better life,
[11:08.080 --> 11:09.260]  things will just start coming together.
[11:09.260 --> 11:11.120]  So write down a goal, that's all you have to do.
[11:11.120 --> 11:13.360]  One goal, accomplish that one goal.
[11:13.360 --> 11:14.820]  That'll turn into two goals,
[11:14.820 --> 11:16.900]  that'll turn into you just crushing fucking life.
[11:16.900 --> 11:19.080]  So write down a goal.
[11:19.080 --> 11:20.780]  This podcast is about cannabis,
[11:20.780 --> 11:23.900]  so we're gonna write down a cannabis-related goal.
[11:23.900 --> 11:26.700]  Here's something I think we should all be striving for.
[11:26.700 --> 11:28.380]  We all want better yield, right?
[11:28.380 --> 11:30.320]  You want to pull more weight.
[11:30.320 --> 11:32.300]  You want more grams per watt.
[11:32.300 --> 11:34.340]  Whatever grow room you've been growing in,
[11:35.340 --> 11:37.600]  however much you've been pulling consistently,
[11:37.600 --> 11:39.660]  let's strive for a little bit more.
[11:39.660 --> 11:42.620]  Let's strive for a better yield in 2018.
[11:42.620 --> 11:44.540]  That's an attainable goal.
[11:44.540 --> 11:45.860]  The only way to reach that goal
[11:45.860 --> 11:48.260]  is to find ways to improve your garden.
[11:48.300 --> 11:50.820]  Now what are a few ways that you can improve your garden
[11:50.820 --> 11:52.780]  to reach your better yield goal?
[11:52.780 --> 11:54.180]  Things like scrogging.
[11:54.180 --> 11:57.500]  If you are not doing any scrogging or any canopy control,
[11:57.500 --> 11:59.820]  you need to get some canopy control going on in the garden.
[11:59.820 --> 12:00.800]  A scrog is real easy.
[12:00.800 --> 12:02.860]  I've done a full episode on scrogging.
[12:02.860 --> 12:05.940]  Scrogging is when you put a net up above the canopy
[12:05.940 --> 12:07.860]  and you bend all the plants down into that net
[12:07.860 --> 12:10.300]  so they can't grow too high, but they're growing out now.
[12:10.300 --> 12:12.380]  Now you are filling your horizontal space
[12:12.380 --> 12:13.500]  instead of the vertical space.
[12:13.500 --> 12:15.100]  You're not growing up into the lights,
[12:15.100 --> 12:16.460]  but you're spreading the plant
[12:16.460 --> 12:17.680]  and you're using up all the space.
[12:18.120 --> 12:21.200]  So scrogging would be a great way to increase your yield.
[12:21.200 --> 12:23.880]  Popping and twisting and super cropping the plants
[12:23.880 --> 12:27.560]  would be a wonderful way to help you increase your yields.
[12:27.560 --> 12:29.720]  When the plants are in veg and they're getting big,
[12:29.720 --> 12:32.520]  walk over and pop the stems.
[12:32.520 --> 12:34.560]  Let me kind of explain this a little bit different.
[12:34.560 --> 12:38.840]  I start about two inches above where the stem
[12:38.840 --> 12:39.680]  comes out of the dirt.
[12:39.680 --> 12:41.640]  So you got some dirt with a little stick sticking out.
[12:41.640 --> 12:44.500]  I just put my finger there and grab the base of that stalk.
[12:44.500 --> 12:46.720]  Then I reach up about an inch above that
[12:46.720 --> 12:48.760]  and I just twist my fingers opposite directions
[12:48.760 --> 12:50.700]  and it sounds like this.
[12:50.700 --> 12:52.060]  It sounds just like you popped your knuckle.
[12:52.060 --> 12:53.160]  That's what I just did.
[12:53.160 --> 12:54.920]  And the plant goes pop and you're just breaking
[12:54.920 --> 12:56.680]  the cellulose right there on the plant.
[12:56.680 --> 12:59.260]  Then I move up about four inches and do it again
[12:59.260 --> 13:01.280]  and move up four inches and do it again.
[13:01.280 --> 13:03.420]  And then I repeat this on all of the larger branches
[13:03.420 --> 13:04.260]  of the plant.
[13:04.260 --> 13:06.500]  You'll start to see knuckles form on all the spots
[13:06.500 --> 13:07.520]  where you've done this.
[13:07.520 --> 13:09.640]  You are now allowing more nutrient
[13:09.640 --> 13:10.560]  to pass through the plant.
[13:10.560 --> 13:13.640]  You are now making that stalk thicker and stronger.
[13:13.640 --> 13:16.400]  You're making bigger, more robust, more active,
[13:16.960 --> 13:17.840]  more productive plants.
[13:17.840 --> 13:19.160]  So get in there and pop them.
[13:19.160 --> 13:20.000]  Just pop them.
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.600]  Just give them a little pop.
[13:21.600 --> 13:22.640]  Just twist it.
[13:22.640 --> 13:24.660]  Try it on a couple branches.
[13:24.660 --> 13:27.260]  Maybe if it's your first try, don't do it at the base.
[13:27.260 --> 13:29.080]  Maybe go to the top of the plant and give it a twist
[13:29.080 --> 13:30.740]  and see what happens when you give it just a little turn.
[13:30.740 --> 13:31.660]  It'll go pop.
[13:31.660 --> 13:33.140]  You're gonna hear a crunch.
[13:33.140 --> 13:33.980]  Perfect.
[13:33.980 --> 13:34.800]  Don't bend it over.
[13:34.800 --> 13:35.720]  Don't break it.
[13:35.720 --> 13:36.760]  Just give it a little pop and a little bit
[13:36.760 --> 13:37.880]  of a twist right there.
[13:37.880 --> 13:40.780]  That's gonna help that plant become stronger, healthier.
[13:40.780 --> 13:42.220]  It's gonna be more active.
[13:42.220 --> 13:43.840]  It's gonna work out a little stronger.
[13:43.840 --> 13:44.800]  So that will help you.
[13:44.800 --> 13:47.360]  Also, defoliation.
[13:47.360 --> 13:48.680]  Oh, and also the popping and twisting.
[13:48.680 --> 13:49.840]  I do that.
[13:49.840 --> 13:51.720]  I start when the plants get kinda big and veg,
[13:51.720 --> 13:54.200]  and I will do that all the way up to week three, four,
[13:54.200 --> 13:56.440]  maybe week five of some plants.
[13:56.440 --> 13:58.520]  Depends on the strain and depends on how robust they are
[13:58.520 --> 13:59.600]  and how they're growing.
[13:59.600 --> 14:02.320]  But week four into flower is not odd
[14:02.320 --> 14:04.120]  to see me walk up and just pop a branch.
[14:04.120 --> 14:04.960]  Pop.
[14:04.960 --> 14:06.360]  And you'll watch it recover within a day
[14:06.360 --> 14:08.240]  and start growing even faster.
[14:08.240 --> 14:10.500]  So you can scrog, you can pop and twist,
[14:10.500 --> 14:12.560]  and then you can defoliate.
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.800]  Get in there and remove leaves that are not necessary.
[14:15.800 --> 14:17.080]  Leaves that are in the way of light
[14:17.080 --> 14:18.380]  getting into your canopy.
[14:18.380 --> 14:19.460]  Take those leaves out of there.
[14:19.460 --> 14:20.560]  You're not trying to grow leaves,
[14:20.560 --> 14:21.900]  you're trying to grow buds.
[14:21.900 --> 14:24.800]  So leaves that are too big, go ahead and take them off.
[14:24.800 --> 14:27.120]  If you're not sure how much defoliating you wanna do
[14:27.120 --> 14:29.520]  and you're kinda new at it and you're a little bit afraid,
[14:29.520 --> 14:31.360]  the first day of flowering, go in there
[14:31.360 --> 14:33.780]  and take off any leaf that's got a purple stem.
[14:33.780 --> 14:35.560]  If you got a big leaf with a purple stem,
[14:35.560 --> 14:36.760]  just take it off.
[14:36.760 --> 14:37.840]  If the plants are healthy,
[14:37.840 --> 14:39.800]  that purple stem will probably just snap right off.
[14:39.800 --> 14:41.000]  You don't need scissors or anything.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.480]  Just grab it, pop it right off of there.
[14:43.480 --> 14:45.680]  If you feel like you're afraid to take too much off,
[14:45.680 --> 14:46.520]  just go lightly.
[14:46.520 --> 14:47.880]  You can always go harder.
[14:47.880 --> 14:50.320]  So on week one, I like to strip the plants.
[14:50.320 --> 14:52.760]  On week two, I like to go in and kinda bottom them.
[14:52.760 --> 14:54.120]  Take out that shit on the bottom.
[14:54.120 --> 14:55.120]  Lollipop a little bit.
[14:55.120 --> 14:57.820]  That's another way to improve your yield.
[14:57.820 --> 15:00.120]  Lollipop, take off all the shit on the bottom.
[15:00.120 --> 15:01.720]  So you'll have big branches that come up.
[15:01.720 --> 15:02.840]  If they don't come up high enough
[15:02.840 --> 15:04.340]  to where you think they're gonna make bud
[15:04.340 --> 15:06.840]  and reach the light, get rid of them.
[15:06.840 --> 15:09.280]  If you've got branches that do come up to the light
[15:09.280 --> 15:11.200]  but there's a bunch of bullshit on the bottom,
[15:11.200 --> 15:13.080]  like little tiny sucker branches coming off,
[15:13.080 --> 15:14.960]  you can clean those all the way off.
[15:14.960 --> 15:16.920]  It's not rare for me to have,
[15:16.920 --> 15:18.720]  if I've got a four foot tall plant,
[15:18.720 --> 15:21.360]  I'll clean up the whole foot off the bottom.
[15:21.360 --> 15:22.600]  There will be just a stalk
[15:22.600 --> 15:24.240]  for the whole 12 inches of the bottom,
[15:24.240 --> 15:25.520]  no branches coming off.
[15:25.520 --> 15:27.080]  Then those first branches that come off,
[15:27.080 --> 15:29.960]  it would not be rare for them to have two feet of nothing
[15:29.960 --> 15:34.100]  and nothing, no bud for the last like foot to 10 inches,
[15:34.100 --> 15:35.300]  maybe eight inches.
[15:35.300 --> 15:36.140]  There's no bud there.
[15:36.140 --> 15:37.020]  I just cleaned it all off
[15:37.020 --> 15:38.740]  because all that bottom shit's not gonna grow.
[15:39.180 --> 15:40.020]  It's not getting light.
[15:40.020 --> 15:41.220]  It's not getting any energy.
[15:41.220 --> 15:43.660]  It's just gonna be crappy stuff that you don't wanna trim.
[15:43.660 --> 15:44.840]  And if you clean it off the bottom,
[15:44.840 --> 15:46.740]  you can move that energy up to the top buds
[15:46.740 --> 15:48.180]  and get the energy up to the top
[15:48.180 --> 15:50.980]  where the shit's easier to trim and you get more production.
[15:50.980 --> 15:53.220]  So week one, do some stripping.
[15:53.220 --> 15:54.740]  Week two, get in there and lollipop.
[15:54.740 --> 15:57.300]  Week three, do more stripping, take more leaves out,
[15:57.300 --> 15:58.740]  clean it up, make more space,
[15:58.740 --> 16:01.060]  spread them out a little bit so the light can get in there.
[16:01.060 --> 16:03.220]  And then on week four, do your final bottoming.
[16:03.220 --> 16:04.460]  Get in there and clean out the bottoms,
[16:04.460 --> 16:06.340]  take off all those little sucker branches,
[16:06.340 --> 16:08.400]  all those little shitty popcorn buds.
[16:09.160 --> 16:12.240]  So it's leaf, bottom, leaf, final bottom.
[16:12.240 --> 16:13.440]  And then you can keep defoliating
[16:13.440 --> 16:15.760]  through the flower cycle if you wish to.
[16:15.760 --> 16:16.880]  That's up to you.
[16:16.880 --> 16:18.440]  If you go too hard on defoliating,
[16:18.440 --> 16:20.160]  you can kinda slow down the growth.
[16:20.160 --> 16:22.880]  You'll slow down bud production if you go too hard.
[16:22.880 --> 16:24.440]  So you'll have to find a happy medium.
[16:24.440 --> 16:26.120]  It's very strain specific.
[16:26.120 --> 16:29.740]  But if you week one, strip, week two, lollipop,
[16:29.740 --> 16:31.380]  week three, strip a little bit more,
[16:31.380 --> 16:34.520]  then week four, go clean up the bottoms for the final part.
[16:34.520 --> 16:37.640]  That will really help you increase your yields.
[16:38.440 --> 16:40.120]  All right, so everybody wants bigger yields.
[16:40.120 --> 16:41.800]  The next thing everybody wants to do,
[16:41.800 --> 16:43.440]  and a goal that you can set for yourself,
[16:43.440 --> 16:45.200]  and a goal that would definitely be attainable
[16:45.200 --> 16:48.440]  if you work at it, is increasing the potency
[16:48.440 --> 16:50.960]  of your finished product.
[16:50.960 --> 16:52.880]  Now, how can we do that?
[16:52.880 --> 16:55.060]  Potency is kind of limited by genetics.
[16:55.060 --> 16:58.280]  If you've got genetics that do not put out high THC,
[16:58.280 --> 17:00.740]  then you may not be able to increase that THC
[17:00.740 --> 17:01.960]  much more than what it already is.
[17:01.960 --> 17:03.560]  You may be reaching its potential.
[17:03.560 --> 17:06.480]  But if you've got some plants that you know can get better,
[17:06.480 --> 17:08.200]  if one of your friends has the same clone,
[17:09.040 --> 17:09.880]  or if you've grown it better before,
[17:09.880 --> 17:12.280]  there are a few things that you can do to dial that in.
[17:12.280 --> 17:14.120]  Consistency is the key.
[17:14.120 --> 17:17.520]  If that plant has the potential of getting 32% THC
[17:17.520 --> 17:19.200]  and you're only getting 28,
[17:19.200 --> 17:22.120]  a few things you can do are dial in
[17:22.120 --> 17:24.080]  the temperature and humidity.
[17:24.080 --> 17:27.180]  Plants like consistency, plants like reliability.
[17:27.180 --> 17:29.000]  Maybe your plant likes it a little hotter.
[17:29.000 --> 17:30.900]  Maybe your plant likes it a little cooler.
[17:30.900 --> 17:33.860]  You're gonna have to dial in the temps and the humidity,
[17:33.860 --> 17:36.320]  and it's going to be plant specific.
[17:36.320 --> 17:38.640]  Growing cannabis is like having a girlfriend.
[17:38.640 --> 17:41.880]  You need to figure out how to cater to that plant
[17:41.880 --> 17:43.680]  to keep it happy.
[17:43.680 --> 17:45.760]  You can't have three girlfriends
[17:45.760 --> 17:47.760]  because you can't keep all three of them happy.
[17:47.760 --> 17:50.120]  One's gonna want to eat at the spaghetti factory.
[17:50.120 --> 17:52.040]  One's gonna want to eat at the cheesecake factory,
[17:52.040 --> 17:54.560]  and one's not gonna fucking have any idea what she wants,
[17:54.560 --> 17:56.040]  and she's gonna leave it up to you.
[17:56.040 --> 17:58.120]  Cannabis plants are the same fucking way.
[17:58.120 --> 18:00.940]  It's hard to have multiple cannabis plants in the same room
[18:00.940 --> 18:03.040]  and dial them all in perfectly.
[18:03.040 --> 18:05.240]  So if you want to improve your potency,
[18:05.240 --> 18:07.680]  select a strain and work with it
[18:07.680 --> 18:09.800]  and figure out what temperature it likes.
[18:09.800 --> 18:11.320]  Figure out what humidity it likes.
[18:11.320 --> 18:14.360]  You'll be able to tell by looking most of the time.
[18:14.360 --> 18:16.760]  You're gonna have to run a strain several times
[18:16.760 --> 18:18.560]  to dial it in perfectly.
[18:18.560 --> 18:20.160]  So get your temps dialed in.
[18:20.160 --> 18:22.000]  Get your humidity dialed in.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.520]  Get your feed dialed in for that specific plant.
[18:24.520 --> 18:26.480]  Does that plant want more nutrients?
[18:26.480 --> 18:28.200]  Does that plant want less nutrients?
[18:28.200 --> 18:30.440]  A lot of people forget that some of the cushes
[18:30.440 --> 18:33.080]  and OG plants, they want a little more cow mag.
[18:33.080 --> 18:34.760]  People forget that some of the plants
[18:34.760 --> 18:36.480]  may want a little more amino acids.
[18:36.480 --> 18:38.320]  They don't pay attention to stuff like that.
[18:38.320 --> 18:41.840]  So for better potency, dial in your crop.
[18:41.840 --> 18:44.120]  Start paying attention to temps and humidity.
[18:44.120 --> 18:45.320]  Be more consistent.
[18:45.320 --> 18:46.920]  Get your pH on point.
[18:46.920 --> 18:48.560]  Get your feeds on point.
[18:48.560 --> 18:51.300]  I wish I could tell you that the plant wants this temperature
[18:51.300 --> 18:53.360]  and this humidity and this much feed,
[18:53.360 --> 18:56.720]  but when you're trying to improve at this level,
[18:56.720 --> 18:58.320]  it's going to be plant-specific.
[18:58.320 --> 19:02.560]  Yes, ideally somewhere between 75 and 78 degrees
[19:02.560 --> 19:03.560]  would be really nice,
[19:03.560 --> 19:06.200]  but maybe your plant is from another region.
[19:06.200 --> 19:08.160]  Maybe your plant is a specific phenotype
[19:08.160 --> 19:09.840]  that wants it really hot and likes it,
[19:09.840 --> 19:11.680]  or maybe it likes it really cold.
[19:11.680 --> 19:13.860]  You're going to have to dial in your plant,
[19:13.860 --> 19:16.760]  which is going to take attention and a relationship.
[19:16.760 --> 19:19.440]  You're going to have to build a relationship with this plant
[19:19.440 --> 19:20.740]  so that you know what it likes.
[19:20.740 --> 19:23.040]  You have to be in there every day looking at it.
[19:23.040 --> 19:25.200]  Take notes, write shit down.
[19:25.200 --> 19:28.580]  You're trying to get this plant perfect.
[19:28.580 --> 19:30.640]  I run a very large commercial grow.
[19:30.640 --> 19:34.120]  We have got approximately 40 different strains in there.
[19:34.120 --> 19:36.740]  I have got notes on a board for all the grow staff
[19:36.740 --> 19:37.800]  just to remind them,
[19:37.800 --> 19:41.520]  hey, the blueberry cookies does not like being overwatered.
[19:41.520 --> 19:43.840]  Do not overwater blueberry cookies.
[19:43.840 --> 19:45.880]  There's another one that gets really pissed off
[19:45.880 --> 19:47.660]  if you defoliate it too hard.
[19:47.660 --> 19:49.720]  There's another one that we have to not pack them
[19:49.720 --> 19:52.080]  too close together because they don't do shit together
[19:52.080 --> 19:53.760]  when you press them too close together.
[19:53.760 --> 19:54.880]  It's learning each plant.
[19:54.880 --> 19:56.540]  It's learning your plant and dialing it in.
[19:56.540 --> 19:58.400]  So if you want to increase your potency,
[19:58.400 --> 20:00.280]  you're going to have to learn that plant.
[20:00.960 --> 20:02.440]  You're going to have to get your room perfect.
[20:02.440 --> 20:04.520]  You're going to have to get everything dialed in.
[20:04.520 --> 20:06.800]  You're going to have to grow that plant a couple of cycles
[20:06.800 --> 20:09.000]  and figure out what it does and does not like.
[20:09.000 --> 20:10.800]  So that's a reachable goal.
[20:10.800 --> 20:14.840]  Better potency is an attainable goal for 2018.
[20:14.840 --> 20:16.760]  Now, a lot of you don't live in legal states.
[20:16.760 --> 20:18.240]  A lot of you that are growing may live somewhere
[20:18.240 --> 20:19.980]  you don't have access to testing.
[20:19.980 --> 20:22.640]  So this may not be a goal that you can verify,
[20:22.640 --> 20:23.960]  but you'll be able to tell.
[20:23.960 --> 20:26.160]  You will be able to see the extra work you put in.
[20:26.160 --> 20:28.640]  You'll be able to tell the extra details
[20:28.640 --> 20:29.680]  that you worked on.
[20:30.080 --> 20:31.920]  You'll be able to see it in the finished product.
[20:31.920 --> 20:33.680]  And I bet you won't even need a lab
[20:33.680 --> 20:36.060]  to show that you were getting better potency.
[20:37.480 --> 20:39.120]  All right, we covered the two obvious things
[20:39.120 --> 20:41.800]  that people want to improve and goals that people can set,
[20:41.800 --> 20:43.800]  which are better yields and better potency.
[20:43.800 --> 20:45.320]  Now, something people don't think about
[20:45.320 --> 20:47.680]  is better scheduling and planning.
[20:47.680 --> 20:49.600]  Let's work on scheduling our gardens
[20:49.600 --> 20:51.620]  and harvests a little bit better.
[20:51.620 --> 20:56.040]  How many harvests do you want to pull in 2018?
[20:56.040 --> 20:59.320]  Can you pull six harvests in 2018 out of your grow room?
[20:59.320 --> 21:02.840]  Can you pull five harvests out of your grow room in 2018?
[21:02.840 --> 21:04.360]  Maybe you've got multiple lights
[21:04.360 --> 21:06.300]  and you're running a perpetual grow in there.
[21:06.300 --> 21:08.440]  Are you gonna try and pull 52 harvests
[21:08.440 --> 21:09.880]  out of a grow room this year?
[21:09.880 --> 21:12.520]  Have a goal, have some schedules going.
[21:12.520 --> 21:16.040]  You should know how long it takes for your plants to flower.
[21:16.040 --> 21:18.160]  Most of us are running nine week plants.
[21:18.160 --> 21:20.000]  If you've got nine week plants,
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.840]  you need to have veg plants ready to replace them
[21:22.840 --> 21:24.880]  when they harvest at the end of week nine.
[21:24.880 --> 21:27.400]  So you need to decide how long you're going to veg.
[21:27.400 --> 21:30.360]  You need to decide how long it takes you to clone.
[21:30.360 --> 21:33.120]  Most of us can get clones rooted in about two weeks.
[21:33.120 --> 21:34.720]  So if you've got a nine week cycle,
[21:34.720 --> 21:37.280]  you need to allow yourself two weeks to cut clones,
[21:37.280 --> 21:39.520]  then however many weeks of veg you want,
[21:39.520 --> 21:42.280]  probably about four weeks of veg for most of us.
[21:42.280 --> 21:43.640]  So that's six weeks.
[21:43.640 --> 21:46.060]  That means if you're running a nine week flower cycle,
[21:46.060 --> 21:49.960]  at week three of flower, you need to cut new clones
[21:49.960 --> 21:52.220]  so that they can root in 14 days
[21:52.220 --> 21:54.240]  and they can veg for four weeks.
[21:54.240 --> 21:56.640]  And then as soon as you cut down that flower room,
[21:56.640 --> 21:58.600]  you can move those veg plants in there
[21:58.600 --> 22:00.840]  and not have any downtime.
[22:00.840 --> 22:02.160]  I'm not sure of your schedule,
[22:02.160 --> 22:05.280]  but that's a good example of what you need to start doing
[22:05.280 --> 22:08.000]  if you want to make the best of your grow room.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.600]  A very easy and attainable goal
[22:10.600 --> 22:13.520]  is to set more scheduling for your grow.
[22:13.520 --> 22:14.740]  The hardest part about that
[22:14.740 --> 22:17.620]  is staying on top of the schedule once you set it.
[22:17.620 --> 22:19.660]  Like I talked about at the start of the show,
[22:19.660 --> 22:21.520]  I wanna make more Lemon Jeffrey seeds.
[22:21.520 --> 22:22.960]  I can't do it until the summer
[22:22.960 --> 22:25.080]  because I have scheduled my rooms out
[22:25.080 --> 22:27.880]  for at least the next six months.
[22:27.880 --> 22:29.180]  And I know that sounds like a long time,
[22:29.180 --> 22:30.020]  but if you think about it,
[22:30.020 --> 22:31.960]  that's only three crops in one room.
[22:31.960 --> 22:35.120]  If you're flowering in one room, six months, three crops.
[22:35.120 --> 22:37.840]  That's actually 2.75 crops
[22:37.840 --> 22:40.240]  because there's a few extra days there at the end
[22:40.240 --> 22:42.600]  because we do the nine week cycles and not four.
[22:42.600 --> 22:46.120]  So that's gonna be like 2.75 crops.
[22:46.120 --> 22:47.900]  But my point is that I've got it scheduled,
[22:47.900 --> 22:49.840]  I've got a plan, I know what I'm gonna do,
[22:49.840 --> 22:52.840]  and then I'm going to do my best to stay on that schedule
[22:52.840 --> 22:54.300]  and not mess myself up.
[22:54.300 --> 22:57.100]  If I do it right, I know how many cycles
[22:57.100 --> 22:59.380]  I'll be able to get this year out of that room.
[22:59.380 --> 23:01.300]  I have a good estimation of how many seeds
[23:01.300 --> 23:04.020]  I'll be able to produce out of that room this year.
[23:04.020 --> 23:07.000]  It just helps you plan, it helps you stay on top of things,
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.720]  and it helps you set goals.
[23:08.720 --> 23:10.100]  So set some goals, you guys.
[23:10.100 --> 23:12.160]  So far we've set goals to get better yields,
[23:12.160 --> 23:14.300]  better potency, and better scheduling.
[23:14.300 --> 23:15.980]  Now let's talk about random things
[23:15.980 --> 23:18.140]  that you guys may be able to set a goal
[23:18.140 --> 23:20.700]  to get better at in your grow.
[23:20.700 --> 23:23.020]  Something a lot of us could get better at in our grow
[23:23.020 --> 23:23.980]  is cloning.
[23:24.660 --> 23:25.780]  How is your clone tech?
[23:25.780 --> 23:27.980]  Are 70% of your clones living?
[23:27.980 --> 23:30.380]  Are 80% of your clones living?
[23:30.380 --> 23:32.100]  How many of your clones live now?
[23:32.100 --> 23:33.580]  If you were to cut 100 clones,
[23:33.580 --> 23:36.580]  how many do you think would be surviving
[23:36.580 --> 23:39.040]  and usable in about 15 days?
[23:39.040 --> 23:41.520]  If I said, hey dude, let's cut 100 clones together,
[23:41.520 --> 23:44.640]  right now, you and me, and I'll be back in 14 days,
[23:44.640 --> 23:46.620]  how many of them would you be proud to show me,
[23:46.620 --> 23:49.220]  and how many of them would you be embarrassed to show me?
[23:49.220 --> 23:51.760]  So if you said 50 of them would have died,
[23:51.760 --> 23:55.400]  let's increase your clone success rate to 70% this year.
[23:55.400 --> 23:58.020]  If you said 70%, let's get you up to 90.
[23:58.020 --> 23:59.800]  If you're in the 80 or 90%,
[23:59.800 --> 24:01.880]  let's get you 100% success in your clones.
[24:01.880 --> 24:04.360]  I'd like to see everybody have 100% success
[24:04.360 --> 24:05.940]  with their clones,
[24:05.940 --> 24:07.860]  but I understand there's some learning to be done.
[24:07.860 --> 24:09.720]  We're not all spending all day in a garden.
[24:09.720 --> 24:11.280]  We're not all spending all of our time
[24:11.280 --> 24:13.000]  learning about cannabis.
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.420]  But a goal that is attainable is improvement.
[24:16.420 --> 24:18.240]  So if you're at 50%, let's get you to 70.
[24:18.240 --> 24:20.420]  If you're at 70, let's get you to 85 or 90.
[24:20.420 --> 24:22.560]  Let's just improve your clone technique.
[24:22.560 --> 24:24.140]  Everybody can get better at cloning.
[24:24.140 --> 24:25.780]  All you have to do is pay more attention.
[24:25.780 --> 24:27.380]  Maybe leave the clones alone.
[24:27.380 --> 24:29.480]  I see a lot of people fuck with clones too much,
[24:29.480 --> 24:30.660]  and that's where they ruin them.
[24:30.660 --> 24:33.680]  So let's get you better at your clone technique.
[24:33.680 --> 24:36.040]  And then another thing that people can definitely improve on
[24:36.040 --> 24:38.380]  at the totally opposite end of the grow from cloning
[24:38.380 --> 24:41.100]  is the drying and curing process.
[24:41.100 --> 24:43.740]  I see a lot of people grow amazing cannabis.
[24:43.740 --> 24:45.680]  They grow it, they take great pictures,
[24:45.680 --> 24:48.140]  they cut it down, they trim it like a fucking champ,
[24:48.140 --> 24:49.220]  they take more pictures,
[24:49.220 --> 24:52.220]  and then they ruin it by not drying and curing it properly.
[24:52.220 --> 24:54.620]  I have put out a couple of episodes about drying and curing.
[24:54.620 --> 24:56.540]  I will answer your questions about drying and curing
[24:56.540 --> 24:57.380]  if you email me.
[24:57.380 --> 24:58.560]  I will help you out.
[24:58.560 --> 25:01.180]  So all of the crops that you're going to produce
[25:01.180 --> 25:03.660]  this year in 2018 that you have got scheduled
[25:03.660 --> 25:05.180]  and planned for your goals,
[25:05.180 --> 25:07.700]  you're going to have to learn to dry and cure them better.
[25:07.700 --> 25:10.100]  Let's make that one of your goals for 2018.
[25:10.100 --> 25:12.540]  Even if you're already an amazing grower,
[25:12.540 --> 25:14.800]  if you're a pro grower, if you know how to cure weed,
[25:14.800 --> 25:17.820]  you can do it better, especially if you're in Colorado.
[25:17.820 --> 25:21.500]  So let's work on learning to dry and cure a little better.
[25:21.500 --> 25:23.380]  That is a goal that you can achieve.
[25:23.380 --> 25:25.140]  And if we say just a little better,
[25:25.140 --> 25:27.500]  you just have to do better than last year.
[25:27.500 --> 25:29.020]  And if you grow five or six crops,
[25:29.020 --> 25:31.040]  you're going to get five or six good chances
[25:31.040 --> 25:33.100]  at getting better this year.
[25:33.100 --> 25:35.980]  So drying and curing is something we can all work on.
[25:35.980 --> 25:37.540]  And if you need more guidance on that,
[25:37.540 --> 25:40.180]  email me, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[25:40.180 --> 25:42.200]  I will talk you through drying and curing.
[25:42.200 --> 25:43.580]  I will write out an SOP,
[25:43.580 --> 25:46.900]  and we will get your cannabis dried properly.
[25:46.900 --> 25:50.540]  All right, and one more thing that you can work on in 2018
[25:50.540 --> 25:52.860]  that you can improve on, a goal that you can set,
[25:52.860 --> 25:56.180]  would be to become more cost efficient.
[25:56.180 --> 25:59.020]  If you are a new grower, if you're a pro grower,
[25:59.020 --> 26:01.100]  if you're an expert, if you're growing in a closet,
[26:01.100 --> 26:03.280]  if you're running a large commercial facility,
[26:03.280 --> 26:06.980]  there are ways that you can become more cost effective.
[26:06.980 --> 26:08.660]  Are you wasting electricity somewhere?
[26:08.660 --> 26:10.140]  Are you wasting nutrients somewhere?
[26:10.140 --> 26:11.580]  Are you wasting products somewhere?
[26:11.580 --> 26:14.060]  Are you wasting time somewhere?
[26:14.060 --> 26:16.900]  Let's look at our process in the garden
[26:16.900 --> 26:19.540]  and streamline the time that we spend in there
[26:19.540 --> 26:22.220]  and streamline the money that we spend in there.
[26:22.220 --> 26:24.900]  Maybe we're wasting water somewhere, let's figure that out.
[26:24.900 --> 26:26.620]  Maybe we're wasting electricity somewhere,
[26:26.620 --> 26:27.820]  let's figure that out.
[26:27.820 --> 26:30.180]  Do you have a fan, an air conditioner,
[26:30.180 --> 26:31.580]  and a blower on at the same time
[26:31.580 --> 26:33.740]  that maybe you only need two of those?
[26:33.740 --> 26:36.100]  If you're growing for profit, if you're growing for medicine,
[26:36.100 --> 26:37.860]  every penny counts either way
[26:37.860 --> 26:39.460]  because somebody's gotta pay for it.
[26:39.460 --> 26:41.900]  And if you're drawing electricity, if you're wasting water,
[26:41.900 --> 26:43.860]  it's just going down the drain basically.
[26:44.540 --> 26:46.580]  And who can afford to put anything down the drain these days
[26:46.580 --> 26:49.140]  and also think about the environmental factors.
[26:49.140 --> 26:51.700]  If you're wasting electricity and wasting water,
[26:51.700 --> 26:54.340]  you're destroying the environment for no reason.
[26:54.340 --> 26:56.420]  We're running out of resources and wasting money.
[26:56.420 --> 26:58.180]  So try to become more cost effective
[26:58.180 --> 26:59.300]  and at the same time,
[26:59.300 --> 27:01.700]  try to become more environmentally conscious.
[27:01.700 --> 27:03.620]  That's something that all of us can do.
[27:03.620 --> 27:05.180]  We're all buying bottled nutrients
[27:05.180 --> 27:07.020]  that have to be shipped across the country.
[27:07.020 --> 27:10.100]  We use the nutrients, we throw the plastic bottles away.
[27:10.100 --> 27:13.260]  Let's try to be more environmentally conscious.
[27:13.260 --> 27:14.460]  Let's be more sustainable.
[27:14.460 --> 27:15.580]  Let's be more responsible.
[27:15.580 --> 27:17.860]  That's an easy goal that we can all set
[27:17.860 --> 27:21.260]  and try to reach in 2018.
[27:21.260 --> 27:23.540]  All right, I hope I have inspired you guys to set some goals.
[27:23.540 --> 27:26.140]  I hope I have inspired you guys to improve your garden.
[27:26.140 --> 27:28.040]  I hope you got a notebook and a pen
[27:28.040 --> 27:29.420]  or maybe something in your phone
[27:29.420 --> 27:31.580]  and took a note and actually wrote some goals.
[27:31.580 --> 27:33.260]  Maybe take a minute and think about some goals
[27:33.260 --> 27:34.100]  for your garden.
[27:34.100 --> 27:37.120]  Also think about some goals for your life in 2018.
[27:37.120 --> 27:39.660]  Your garden shouldn't be the only thing you're worried about.
[27:39.660 --> 27:41.820]  Challenge yourself, set some goals for yourself,
[27:41.820 --> 27:43.940]  write it down, set some expectations,
[27:43.940 --> 27:46.300]  reach those goals, move your life forward.
[27:46.300 --> 27:48.260]  Get yourself out of the hole you're stuck in.
[27:48.260 --> 27:49.460]  Make your own life better.
[27:49.460 --> 27:51.620]  All right, I wanna thank everybody for listening to me.
[27:51.620 --> 27:53.580]  Ramble on for about 30 minutes.

[28:41.220 --> 28:42.420]  I would love to hear from you.
[28:42.420 --> 28:43.900]  You guys, this is the part of the podcast
[28:43.900 --> 28:45.740]  where I remind you about Patreon.
[28:45.740 --> 28:47.540]  This podcast will always be free,
[28:47.540 --> 28:48.860]  but if you feel like this podcast
[28:48.860 --> 28:50.140]  was worth a couple of bucks,
[28:50.140 --> 28:52.720]  I would appreciate it if you go to patreon.com
[28:52.720 --> 28:54.820]  slash growfromyourheart and sign up
[28:54.820 --> 28:56.580]  to contribute to the podcast.
[28:56.580 --> 28:57.980]  What I will do with your contributions
[28:57.980 --> 28:59.620]  is I will pay for my website.
[28:59.620 --> 29:02.980]  IreeGeneticsColorado.com is where I host the podcast.
[29:02.980 --> 29:04.300]  The podcast is free for you,
[29:04.300 --> 29:07.460]  but it does cost me a few bucks to host that website.
[29:07.460 --> 29:08.660]  When you contribute to Patreon,
[29:08.660 --> 29:11.020]  I will use those funds to cover the cost of my website
[29:11.020 --> 29:13.800]  to keep this podcast coming to you guys for free.
[29:13.800 --> 29:16.300]  I also use those funds to buy microphone covers
[29:16.300 --> 29:17.500]  and water bottles,
[29:17.500 --> 29:19.060]  and if any of my equipment happens to break,
[29:19.060 --> 29:21.560]  I will use the Patreon funding to cover that sort of stuff,
[29:21.560 --> 29:23.020]  but that's what Patreon is for.
[29:23.020 --> 29:23.860]  I'm not trying to beg.
[29:23.860 --> 29:25.140]  I just know that there are a few people out there
[29:25.140 --> 29:28.100]  who have offered to make contributions to the show,
[29:28.100 --> 29:30.480]  and so I made sure that there was an option.
[29:30.480 --> 29:31.640]  And big shout out to everybody
[29:31.640 --> 29:34.340]  who has contributed to the Patreon campaign.
[29:34.340 --> 29:36.440]  I was actually able to cover the cost
[29:36.440 --> 29:37.740]  of the website this year
[29:37.740 --> 29:39.060]  without reaching into my pocket.
[29:39.060 --> 29:41.140]  Patreon covered that all for me this year,
[29:41.140 --> 29:43.900]  so huge shout out to everybody that contributed to Patreon.
[29:43.900 --> 29:45.840]  I truly appreciate it.
[29:45.840 --> 29:46.940]  Thank you.
[29:46.940 --> 29:48.940]  All right, podcast world, I'm gonna wrap up this episode.
[29:48.940 --> 29:50.460]  I wanna wish everybody a happy new year.
[29:50.460 --> 29:53.240]  I hope 2018 brings you everything you deserve.
[29:53.240 --> 29:55.860]  I'll be back Thursday with a Throwback Thursday episode.
[29:55.860 --> 29:57.140]  Of course, I'll be back Monday
[29:57.140 --> 29:58.980]  with a brand new Grow episode.
[29:58.980 --> 30:01.360]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friend, Hot Saucerman,
[30:01.360 --> 30:03.700]  and until next time, take a fat dab
[30:03.700 --> 30:41.540]  and give your mom a hug for me.
