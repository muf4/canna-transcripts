[00:16.380 --> 00:19.060]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.060 --> 00:20.900]  It's time for episode number 297
[00:20.900 --> 00:22.620]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:22.620 --> 00:26.540]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:26.540 --> 00:27.700]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:27.700 --> 00:28.900]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:28.900 --> 00:31.380]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.380 --> 00:32.700]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:32.700 --> 00:34.180]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.180 --> 00:36.060]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.060 --> 00:39.020]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.020 --> 00:41.140]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.140 --> 00:43.220]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.220 --> 00:45.420]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.420 --> 00:46.980]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.980 --> 00:49.460]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.460 --> 00:51.140]  Big shout out to Kat, Ku,
[00:51.140 --> 00:53.460]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.500 --> 00:57.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the podcast
[00:57.340 --> 00:58.300]  is brought to you by my friends
[00:58.300 --> 01:00.300]  at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:00.300 --> 01:01.900]  If you need new genetics for your garden,
[01:01.900 --> 01:04.340]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:04.340 --> 01:07.580]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:09.460 --> 01:10.840]  All right, I like to start these episodes off
[01:10.840 --> 01:12.100]  by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[01:12.100 --> 01:15.500]  Today I've been taking dabs of Skywalker Live Batter
[01:15.500 --> 01:17.620]  from our friends at the Garden of Whedon.
[01:17.620 --> 01:18.460]  I've been talking about this
[01:18.460 --> 01:19.540]  in the past couple of episodes.
[01:19.540 --> 01:22.340]  This has got a great Skywalker aroma.
[01:22.340 --> 01:25.300]  It's earthy, it's got some gas to it,
[01:25.300 --> 01:27.020]  it's got a little bit of a funk to it,
[01:27.020 --> 01:30.220]  and it definitely gives me a super nice head high.
[01:30.220 --> 01:31.620]  I really like it, it's nice and relaxing,
[01:31.620 --> 01:32.860]  it makes my eyes nice and mellow,
[01:32.860 --> 01:34.860]  it makes me nice and chilled out.
[01:34.860 --> 01:37.740]  But also, I've been smoking on some flowers today, you guys.
[01:37.740 --> 01:39.660]  I had some friends stop by.
[01:39.660 --> 01:40.900]  Shout out to my friends who dropped in,
[01:40.900 --> 01:41.740]  they know who they are,
[01:42.380 --> 01:43.580]  and they brought me some amazing gifts.
[01:43.580 --> 01:46.140]  That's right, I was gifted, it looks like about an eighth,
[01:46.140 --> 01:49.380]  of Lemon Sunrise flowers from our friends at Organtica.
[01:49.380 --> 01:51.860]  That's right, Lemon Sunrise, it's Lemon Jeffery,
[01:51.860 --> 01:53.940]  which is a strain I bred, crossed to the Arise,
[01:53.940 --> 01:55.180]  which is another strain I bred,
[01:55.180 --> 01:56.220]  and then I crossed them together
[01:56.220 --> 01:58.500]  and I made the Lemon Sunrise.
[01:58.500 --> 01:59.940]  When I crack this container open,
[01:59.940 --> 02:03.140]  I can smell the Lemon Jeffery just come jumping out.
[02:03.140 --> 02:05.420]  It is bright green, it is covered in trichomes.
[02:05.420 --> 02:06.780]  Great work, you guys.
[02:06.780 --> 02:07.980]  Great work with the Lemon Sunrise.
[02:07.980 --> 02:09.220]  I'm smelling it right now.
[02:10.220 --> 02:12.980]  It smells like lemons and funk, and it is beautiful.
[02:12.980 --> 02:14.660]  Great work, thank you for the gift.
[02:14.660 --> 02:17.140]  But also, this is the one that really got my attention.
[02:17.140 --> 02:19.100]  This is the Cream.
[02:19.100 --> 02:21.340]  I bred this one, our friends at Organtica grew it,
[02:21.340 --> 02:22.540]  and they did a marvelous job.
[02:22.540 --> 02:25.580]  The Cream is Cookies and Cream number 13
[02:25.580 --> 02:29.500]  from Exotic Genetics, crossed to my Arise.
[02:29.500 --> 02:30.620]  And I'm gonna open up the container here
[02:30.620 --> 02:32.500]  and give this a little bit of a smell.
[02:34.140 --> 02:37.660]  It's got a, oh, there's so many different things going on.
[02:37.740 --> 02:41.820]  There's a hint of a pepperiness,
[02:41.820 --> 02:43.740]  a hint of the Girl Scout cookie strain,
[02:43.740 --> 02:47.220]  but also, more dominating that,
[02:47.220 --> 02:51.180]  it smells like the foam of an A&W cream soda,
[02:51.180 --> 02:53.540]  or if you go to a nice Italian restaurant
[02:53.540 --> 02:57.280]  and you get an Italian, a vanilla Italian cream soda,
[02:57.280 --> 02:59.660]  it smells like the foam on top of that.
[02:59.660 --> 03:02.300]  It's got a really soft yet funky smell.
[03:03.140 --> 03:04.420]  I just keep smelling it over and over,
[03:04.420 --> 03:07.260]  hoping that it will come through the microphone.
[03:07.260 --> 03:08.700]  It's not working.
[03:08.700 --> 03:10.860]  Anyway, I'm glad that these guys brought me
[03:10.860 --> 03:13.580]  some of the Cream, because a lot of my listeners
[03:13.580 --> 03:15.460]  have been asking for another episode
[03:15.460 --> 03:18.260]  where I highlight a strain that I have bred.
[03:18.260 --> 03:21.940]  So this episode, of course, is going to be about the Cream.
[03:21.940 --> 03:24.660]  Let's talk a little bit about the Cream.
[03:24.660 --> 03:26.140]  The sample I've got in front of me today
[03:26.140 --> 03:28.460]  was grown by our friends at Organtica.
[03:28.460 --> 03:30.620]  Organtica is in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
[03:30.620 --> 03:31.860]  if I have failed to mention that.
[03:31.860 --> 03:34.660]  So thanks to my friends for driving from Albuquerque
[03:34.660 --> 03:36.140]  to come hang out with me today.
[03:36.140 --> 03:41.140]  The sample that they brought me tested at 27.4% THCA.
[03:41.200 --> 03:43.220]  So this will be the sample that I'm talking about
[03:43.220 --> 03:44.460]  in the episode.
[03:44.460 --> 03:46.280]  This will be my reminder,
[03:46.280 --> 03:49.020]  my visual and odoriferous representation,
[03:49.020 --> 03:50.460]  although I have grown this a bunch of times,
[03:50.460 --> 03:53.020]  so I've got a lot of ideas of what this strain does
[03:53.020 --> 03:54.220]  and what to expect from it.
[03:54.220 --> 03:56.100]  So let's talk about the Cream a little bit.
[03:56.100 --> 03:57.940]  I've been rambling long enough to set it up.
[03:57.940 --> 03:58.980]  Let's get right down to it.
[03:58.980 --> 04:00.460]  The Cream.
[04:00.460 --> 04:03.660]  The Cream from iRegenetics is cookies and cream number 13
[04:03.660 --> 04:04.780]  from Exotic Genetics.
[04:04.780 --> 04:06.780]  That's the cut that is known for winning
[04:06.780 --> 04:09.260]  a bunch of Concentrate Awards.
[04:09.260 --> 04:11.340]  It is Girl Scout cookies.
[04:11.340 --> 04:15.180]  They say it's an unknown phenotype of Girl Scout cookies.
[04:15.180 --> 04:17.660]  It's either the Thin Mint, the Platinum Cookies,
[04:17.660 --> 04:19.220]  or the Forum Cookies.
[04:19.220 --> 04:22.300]  Judging by the aromas, I would say it is the Forum Cookies
[04:22.300 --> 04:24.040]  that I am very familiar with.
[04:24.040 --> 04:26.580]  It's the Forum Cookies cross to Starfighter.
[04:26.580 --> 04:27.500]  What is Starfighter?
[04:27.500 --> 04:31.740]  Starfighter is Alien Tahoe OG and Lemon Alien Dog.
[04:31.740 --> 04:34.340]  So you got some Tahoe OG funk in there,
[04:34.900 --> 04:38.020]  and you got some Dog funk plus Lemon in there.
[04:38.020 --> 04:40.620]  When they crossed the Girl Scout cookies to the Starfighter,
[04:40.620 --> 04:42.740]  it made cookies and cream.
[04:42.740 --> 04:45.540]  The clone that I got makes a lot of trichomes.
[04:45.540 --> 04:49.540]  It makes very frosty, light-colored buds.
[04:49.540 --> 04:52.860]  The problem with it is it didn't grow very well for me.
[04:52.860 --> 04:53.900]  It didn't produce enough.
[04:53.900 --> 04:55.420]  I was using it in a commercial grow,
[04:55.420 --> 04:57.320]  and it was going to get me fired
[04:57.320 --> 05:00.460]  if I kept growing that strain in a commercial grow.
[05:00.460 --> 05:02.940]  So I bred it to the Arise.
[05:02.940 --> 05:06.380]  Arise is Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[05:06.380 --> 05:09.820]  Golden Goat is Island Sweetskunk, Hawaiian Sativa,
[05:09.820 --> 05:11.180]  and Romulan.
[05:11.180 --> 05:15.380]  Daybreaker is Chemdog D to Joseph OG.
[05:15.380 --> 05:16.660]  Let's talk about the Daybreaker
[05:16.660 --> 05:18.620]  because that's where a lot of things start.
[05:18.620 --> 05:22.340]  The Daybreaker, Chemdog D, Chemdog.
[05:22.340 --> 05:27.340]  It's got a rubber, a burnt rubber sort of a smell,
[05:27.380 --> 05:30.660]  but a funky gas sort of a thing,
[05:30.660 --> 05:32.420]  and a fuel sort of a smell,
[05:32.420 --> 05:34.620]  and a dirty feet thing happening.
[05:34.620 --> 05:38.940]  So they took the Chemd and crossed that to Joseph OG.
[05:38.940 --> 05:41.560]  Joseph OG is an OG Kush phenotype
[05:41.560 --> 05:46.180]  that smells like earth and fuel and funk,
[05:46.180 --> 05:51.020]  and it's got this just pungent nose-wrinkling thing to it.
[05:51.020 --> 05:54.340]  So the Daybreaker came out as a funky,
[05:54.340 --> 05:58.140]  foot-smelling OG Kush that grew like Chemd
[05:58.140 --> 05:59.140]  and had some feel to it.
[05:59.980 --> 06:01.740]  When you dry it and cure it properly,
[06:01.740 --> 06:04.220]  it smells like a package of fresh tennis balls
[06:04.220 --> 06:06.900]  or car tires, but in a good way.
[06:06.900 --> 06:08.420]  So that was the Daybreaker.
[06:08.420 --> 06:11.020]  It was crossed to the Golden Goat.
[06:11.020 --> 06:14.060]  Golden Goat has all of those tropical things going on.
[06:14.060 --> 06:16.460]  It's got the Island Sweetskunk and the Sativa,
[06:16.460 --> 06:17.580]  or the Hawaiian Sativa.
[06:17.580 --> 06:22.460]  That gives it a tropical, jungle-y sort of bubblegum-y,
[06:22.460 --> 06:24.580]  juicy fruit sort of a flavor.
[06:24.580 --> 06:26.340]  Then it's got the Romulan in there
[06:26.340 --> 06:30.140]  to give it a better structure and a better flowering time.
[06:30.140 --> 06:33.100]  I crossed the Golden Goat to the Daybreaker
[06:33.100 --> 06:34.600]  to create the Arise.
[06:36.460 --> 06:38.880]  The male that I use is known as King Solomon.
[06:40.180 --> 06:44.140]  The Golden Goat brings out a really tropical flavor,
[06:44.140 --> 06:48.100]  and the Daybreaker gives it a really great structure
[06:48.100 --> 06:50.740]  and dense buds and big plants.
[06:50.740 --> 06:54.000]  So King Solomon, to Cookies and Cream number 13
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.180]  from Exotic Genetics, makes the Cream.
[06:57.020 --> 06:59.780]  I call it the Cream because the cream rises to the top,
[07:01.220 --> 07:02.580]  and it also smells like the cream.
[07:02.580 --> 07:05.240]  It smells like the cream from an Italian cream soda,
[07:05.240 --> 07:07.500]  or maybe some really fancy coffee creamer.
[07:07.500 --> 07:09.620]  It smells delightful.
[07:09.620 --> 07:12.460]  But let's talk more about the strain and how it grows.
[07:12.460 --> 07:15.260]  I mentioned earlier that the Cookies and Cream number 13
[07:16.660 --> 07:19.400]  was kind of a slow grower and a shitty yielder.
[07:19.400 --> 07:23.220]  However, she made some of the best water hash
[07:23.220 --> 07:24.260]  I have ever experienced.
[07:24.260 --> 07:27.360]  Ice hash, water hash, rosin.
[07:27.360 --> 07:30.180]  The Cookies and Cream 13 made some of the best
[07:30.180 --> 07:32.700]  non-solvent concentrates ever.
[07:33.940 --> 07:35.420]  But it just didn't yield a lot.
[07:35.420 --> 07:38.780]  But it did have an amazing flavor and a great high.
[07:38.780 --> 07:41.240]  When I pollinated it with the Arise,
[07:41.240 --> 07:44.700]  it increased the vigor, it increased the yields,
[07:44.700 --> 07:46.900]  it kept the trichome production,
[07:46.900 --> 07:50.860]  and it gave several new flavors to the palate.
[07:51.820 --> 07:54.300]  So let's talk about growing a little bit.
[07:54.300 --> 07:57.260]  The cream likes to go about 60 days,
[07:57.260 --> 07:58.660]  maybe a little longer.
[07:58.660 --> 08:00.580]  70 is usually enough.
[08:00.580 --> 08:01.500]  I like it.
[08:01.500 --> 08:03.700]  The flavor is there when you cut it a little bit earlier.
[08:03.700 --> 08:07.220]  If you let it go a little longer, that soft,
[08:07.220 --> 08:09.740]  the vanilla cream flavor starts to disappear
[08:09.740 --> 08:11.180]  if you let it go too long.
[08:11.180 --> 08:15.220]  So maybe 65 days, 70 is usually more than enough.
[08:15.220 --> 08:19.140]  It likes to get fairly tall.
[08:19.140 --> 08:20.500]  There are some Finos.
[08:21.140 --> 08:21.980]  We'll talk about that in a minute.
[08:21.980 --> 08:23.220]  It likes to get fairly tall.
[08:23.220 --> 08:25.780]  You're gonna get tall, long, skinny buds.
[08:25.780 --> 08:27.700]  They're going to need supports.
[08:27.700 --> 08:31.100]  You're gonna either need stakes, tomato cages,
[08:31.100 --> 08:31.940]  or a trellis.
[08:31.940 --> 08:34.140]  If you do trellis, you're gonna need two,
[08:34.140 --> 08:35.820]  maybe three layers of trellis,
[08:35.820 --> 08:37.780]  depending on how tall your plants are.
[08:38.620 --> 08:40.760]  These plants like to end up kind of a white,
[08:40.760 --> 08:43.460]  silvery, golden color at the end.
[08:43.460 --> 08:45.640]  I really like the color.
[08:45.640 --> 08:46.700]  I'm gonna look at some of these buds
[08:46.700 --> 08:48.340]  that we've got from our friends here at Organica.
[08:48.340 --> 08:50.980]  These are really light green,
[08:50.980 --> 08:52.540]  but they are coated in trichomes.
[08:52.540 --> 08:54.600]  And something I should mention is they are rock hard.
[08:54.600 --> 08:56.500]  I'm gonna turn the microphone toward the computer
[08:56.500 --> 08:59.260]  and I'm gonna just drop this onto my MacBook
[08:59.260 --> 09:00.840]  so you can hear how dense this bud is.
[09:00.840 --> 09:02.440]  You should be able to hear this.
[09:03.300 --> 09:04.980]  I heard that.
[09:04.980 --> 09:06.740]  That's a bud hitting my MacBook, you guys.
[09:06.740 --> 09:08.420]  That's how dense these nuggets are.
[09:08.420 --> 09:10.100]  Great grow on this, you guys.
[09:10.100 --> 09:11.900]  The folks that grew this did a hell of a good job.
[09:11.900 --> 09:12.740]  Good job, boys.
[09:13.860 --> 09:18.120]  But you're gonna get super dense buds, super dense.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.560]  This is not a strain to grow
[09:21.560 --> 09:24.360]  if you're looking for a big donkey dick giant cola.
[09:24.360 --> 09:26.560]  If you want a glory cola, this isn't the one.
[09:26.560 --> 09:29.520]  I would say get yourself a pack of Arise or Lemon Sunrise
[09:29.520 --> 09:31.220]  if you want that giant cola.
[09:31.220 --> 09:33.240]  This is gonna make smaller buds,
[09:33.240 --> 09:35.160]  but they are coated in trichomes.
[09:35.160 --> 09:38.320]  And the aroma and the high are amazing.
[09:38.320 --> 09:40.080]  So it's gonna get kind of tall on you.
[09:40.080 --> 09:41.660]  Have some supports ready.
[09:41.660 --> 09:43.720]  Multiple layers of trellis.
[09:43.720 --> 09:46.320]  She likes to be defoliated, but don't go too crazy
[09:46.320 --> 09:48.960]  because you'll piss her off if you defoliate it too much.
[09:48.960 --> 09:51.760]  It doesn't like to be over watered.
[09:51.760 --> 09:53.680]  The cream does not like over watering.
[09:53.680 --> 09:57.080]  I think she does better with medium amounts of water.
[09:57.080 --> 09:59.120]  She would rather have a little bit of dry time
[09:59.120 --> 10:00.240]  instead of getting soaked.
[10:00.240 --> 10:02.180]  So let her dry up a little bit and she will do okay.
[10:02.180 --> 10:03.400]  Pay attention to her.
[10:03.400 --> 10:05.440]  You gotta pay attention to let her get crunchy dry,
[10:05.440 --> 10:08.480]  but let your medium get a little more dry
[10:08.480 --> 10:11.200]  than you normally would with most of your other strains.
[10:11.200 --> 10:15.520]  So she's gonna have a bunch of great unique smells.
[10:15.520 --> 10:18.600]  Smells like vanilla and kush.
[10:18.600 --> 10:20.040]  And I think that Girl Scout Cookies
[10:20.040 --> 10:24.280]  has a Durban Poison plus black pepper sort of a smell.
[10:24.280 --> 10:26.820]  And you'll get that out of some of the phenotypes.
[10:26.820 --> 10:28.740]  The black pepper isn't as dominant.
[10:28.740 --> 10:31.820]  I think all the alien crosses, the lemon alien
[10:31.820 --> 10:34.840]  and the alien Tahoe kind of crossed out the pepper terp.
[10:34.840 --> 10:36.400]  I think that got removed.
[10:36.400 --> 10:37.980]  But you're gonna find vanilla.
[10:37.980 --> 10:39.280]  You're gonna find kush.
[10:39.280 --> 10:41.460]  You're gonna find that cream soda terp.
[10:41.460 --> 10:46.460]  This one's got like an anise and cream soda
[10:46.780 --> 10:47.740]  sort of a thing going on.
[10:47.740 --> 10:50.180]  And I really, really enjoy it.
[10:50.180 --> 10:52.820]  These flowers that I've got look very close
[10:52.820 --> 10:54.340]  to what the cookies and cream flowers
[10:54.340 --> 10:55.420]  that I used to grow look like.
[10:55.420 --> 10:57.140]  So this looks very similar to Mommy,
[10:57.140 --> 10:58.980]  but it's got a better smell.
[10:58.980 --> 11:02.140]  And it seems to have a tighter bud structure.
[11:02.140 --> 11:03.360]  But I can tell by looking at this
[11:03.360 --> 11:08.300]  that this would make amazing rosin or amazing bubble hash.
[11:08.300 --> 11:09.980]  We used to have bubble hash made
[11:09.980 --> 11:12.340]  and then we would press the bubble hash into rosin.
[11:12.340 --> 11:14.260]  And that was some of the best concentrates we smoked.
[11:14.260 --> 11:16.100]  If you ever shopped at Green and Healthy Wellness
[11:16.100 --> 11:17.860]  back in the day and got the cream rosin,
[11:17.860 --> 11:19.100]  that's what I'm talking about.
[11:19.100 --> 11:20.420]  That stuff was great.
[11:20.420 --> 11:23.180]  So let's talk more about this.
[11:23.180 --> 11:24.420]  I've talked about the smells.
[11:24.420 --> 11:26.700]  I've talked about the grow time.
[11:26.700 --> 11:31.100]  pH, this one, this plant likes to play some tricks on you.
[11:31.100 --> 11:32.820]  It will look like it's got a problem,
[11:32.820 --> 11:35.260]  but that's just the colors that the leaves make.
[11:35.260 --> 11:36.760]  Having Girl Scout cookies in it
[11:36.760 --> 11:39.620]  means that you're gonna get some dark leaf coloration.
[11:40.500 --> 11:43.340]  It's gonna look like you've got pH problems.
[11:43.340 --> 11:48.340]  Keep it around 6.3 to 6.5 and she should be happy with you.
[11:48.800 --> 11:51.700]  Also, one thing I noticed that will correct her
[11:51.700 --> 11:54.660]  is she likes a little amino acids.
[11:54.660 --> 11:57.700]  I was feeding her the Amino from Photosynthesis Plus
[11:57.700 --> 11:59.580]  and it really seemed to make her happy.
[11:59.580 --> 12:02.620]  It made all those weird leaf colors kind of minimize
[12:02.620 --> 12:03.780]  and it worked a little better.
[12:03.780 --> 12:06.260]  Also, too much cow mag will piss her off.
[12:06.260 --> 12:08.920]  Too much cow mag will piss off the cream.
[12:08.960 --> 12:11.280]  I don't know why, but it does not seem to like
[12:11.280 --> 12:12.480]  a whole lot of cow mag.
[12:12.480 --> 12:15.320]  Most of those OG Kush strains love the cow mag.
[12:15.320 --> 12:19.400]  I can overdose the cream really, really easily.
[12:19.400 --> 12:22.400]  So there's a couple of different phenotypes.
[12:23.560 --> 12:25.720]  There's a small phenotype.
[12:25.720 --> 12:30.720]  It is kind of shitty, but if you were running a small grow,
[12:30.720 --> 12:33.760]  the smaller phenotype that doesn't branch out a lot,
[12:33.760 --> 12:35.520]  it grows straight up and it makes
[12:35.520 --> 12:37.620]  very minimal side branching.
[12:37.620 --> 12:40.300]  That thing would be amazing for a small,
[12:40.300 --> 12:43.220]  sea of green, single cola type of grow.
[12:43.220 --> 12:45.820]  If you find that one and you're running a small hut,
[12:45.820 --> 12:48.860]  I would do a four by four or a five by five table
[12:48.860 --> 12:51.600]  with like four rows of four or five rows of five,
[12:51.600 --> 12:54.000]  do 16 or 20 small plants.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.420]  That cream phenotype that grows straight up
[12:56.420 --> 12:58.060]  would be perfect for that.
[12:58.060 --> 13:01.620]  It's just gonna grow one long spear of resin.
[13:01.620 --> 13:02.940]  It's not gonna branch out at all.
[13:02.940 --> 13:05.100]  You're not gonna have any side branching on that one.
[13:05.100 --> 13:06.540]  I don't know where that came from.
[13:06.540 --> 13:08.540]  I don't know where in the genetic line that happened.
[13:08.540 --> 13:10.940]  That's not supposed to happen with this cross,
[13:10.940 --> 13:13.260]  but that's a phenotype that will pop up.
[13:13.260 --> 13:14.900]  If you like that, it is amazing.
[13:14.900 --> 13:16.040]  If you're not into that cola,
[13:16.040 --> 13:17.500]  you'll be able to notice it
[13:17.500 --> 13:19.100]  fairly early into the grow process.
[13:19.100 --> 13:20.440]  It's the one that just goes straight up.
[13:20.440 --> 13:22.940]  All of the others are having side branching happening.
[13:22.940 --> 13:23.860]  That one just goes straight up.
[13:23.860 --> 13:25.220]  It'll be taller than everybody.
[13:25.220 --> 13:26.480]  You may think it's a male.
[13:26.480 --> 13:27.380]  It may not be a male.
[13:27.380 --> 13:30.300]  It may just be the phenotype that goes straight up.
[13:30.300 --> 13:31.500]  It's a little slower growing,
[13:31.500 --> 13:33.000]  so you should be able to find it,
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.640]  but cull that one unless you want
[13:34.640 --> 13:37.480]  that one single cola type plant.
[13:37.480 --> 13:40.720]  The other ones, they're phenotypes that get quite branchy.
[13:40.720 --> 13:43.200]  I recommend that you top this plant.
[13:43.200 --> 13:44.440]  Top it aggressively.
[13:44.440 --> 13:46.360]  Go low because it's gonna stretch out.
[13:46.360 --> 13:47.960]  It's going to fill in the space.
[13:48.880 --> 13:52.120]  It will probably double in height when you flower it.
[13:52.120 --> 13:54.160]  If you've got a plant that's a foot and a half tall,
[13:54.160 --> 13:55.720]  you're gonna have a three foot tall plant
[13:55.720 --> 13:56.560]  by the end of flower,
[13:56.560 --> 13:59.160]  so give yourself plenty of head space
[13:59.160 --> 14:01.300]  if you are working with the cream.
[14:02.140 --> 14:06.660]  Almost every phenotype produces heavy, heavy resin.
[14:06.660 --> 14:08.060]  Mad resin.
[14:08.060 --> 14:11.500]  Just as a hint, there is one phenotype that is super leafy.
[14:11.500 --> 14:12.940]  That is not my favorite.
[14:12.940 --> 14:14.780]  The one with the minimal leaves
[14:14.780 --> 14:16.680]  that shoot out the purple petioles
[14:16.680 --> 14:18.100]  and the crazy looking leaves,
[14:18.100 --> 14:20.860]  that is the keeper on the cream in my opinion.
[14:20.860 --> 14:23.580]  That's the one that has this beautiful
[14:23.580 --> 14:25.780]  root beer cream soda sort of flavor,
[14:25.780 --> 14:27.260]  so maybe that'll help you out.
[14:27.260 --> 14:28.660]  There's the tall, skinny one.
[14:28.660 --> 14:30.560]  If you're growing a screen of green type of thing
[14:30.560 --> 14:32.760]  or a sea of green, there's that tall, skinny one.
[14:32.760 --> 14:34.240]  If you want the single cola,
[14:34.240 --> 14:36.000]  then there's the one that branches out
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.160]  and it's got long petioles and crazy leaves.
[14:39.160 --> 14:41.840]  They'll start curling up a little bit.
[14:41.840 --> 14:42.920]  That's a great sign.
[14:42.920 --> 14:45.240]  That's the phenotype that I like.
[14:45.240 --> 14:47.160]  The phenotype that puts out a lot of leaf,
[14:47.160 --> 14:48.760]  she does harvest a little better,
[14:48.760 --> 14:50.600]  however she doesn't have that aroma
[14:50.600 --> 14:53.120]  that I really, really enjoy from the cream.
[14:53.120 --> 14:54.200]  Hopefully you can find the one
[14:54.200 --> 14:56.680]  that puts out a ton of resin,
[14:56.680 --> 14:59.800]  the one that's got that cream soda flavor,
[14:59.800 --> 15:01.480]  and the one that puts out good weight
[15:01.480 --> 15:04.480]  and also the one that flowers right at 63 days.
[15:04.480 --> 15:06.400]  That's the great one right there.
[15:06.400 --> 15:10.220]  The longer the petiole, the more resin I feel like happens
[15:10.220 --> 15:11.920]  with this particular strain,
[15:11.920 --> 15:14.320]  and those more jagged leaves seem to be
[15:14.320 --> 15:16.240]  a sign of the more desirable phenotype.
[15:16.240 --> 15:18.960]  The wider the leaf, the less desirable phenotype,
[15:18.960 --> 15:21.080]  in my opinion, when it comes to the cream.
[15:21.080 --> 15:23.440]  You want the one that looks like it's gonna cut ya.
[15:23.440 --> 15:26.220]  It's got very skinny, very serrated leaves,
[15:26.220 --> 15:28.520]  and they're hanging off of a very long petiole,
[15:28.520 --> 15:32.200]  and then the bud makes long, skinny spears
[15:32.200 --> 15:33.320]  that are coated in resin,
[15:33.320 --> 15:35.000]  so that's the one you're looking for.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.440]  Something else I should be sure to mention,
[15:36.440 --> 15:39.520]  I keep talking about this cream soda flavor.
[15:39.520 --> 15:40.840]  That doesn't really come out
[15:40.840 --> 15:42.920]  until it's dried and cured and harvested.
[15:42.920 --> 15:46.160]  It's got a green smell to it as it's growing.
[15:46.160 --> 15:48.800]  Don't worry if it doesn't smell like cookies and cream
[15:48.800 --> 15:51.920]  and cream and cream soda and vanilla until the end.
[15:51.920 --> 15:56.360]  It'll have a danker, cushier plant sort of a smell,
[15:56.360 --> 15:57.480]  but as you dry it and cure it
[15:57.480 --> 15:58.720]  and it loses that chlorophyll,
[15:58.720 --> 16:01.840]  that's when that vanilla aroma really starts to come out,
[16:01.840 --> 16:04.120]  and the longer you keep it cured,
[16:04.120 --> 16:06.720]  it feels like the drier it gets, the softer the buds become,
[16:06.720 --> 16:09.680]  the more that aroma just comes out,
[16:09.680 --> 16:11.600]  and it gets more vanilla-y as time goes on.
[16:11.600 --> 16:14.040]  It gets richer, but also softer.
[16:14.040 --> 16:18.000]  I don't know how to describe a soft vanilla smell.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.400]  If somebody asked me for an iReed genetic strain
[16:20.400 --> 16:22.780]  that I would recommend for making concentrates
[16:22.780 --> 16:25.320]  that are not BHO concentrates,
[16:25.320 --> 16:28.880]  like water hash, ice hash, sift, rosin,
[16:28.880 --> 16:30.600]  anything in that realm,
[16:30.600 --> 16:33.400]  the cream would be my first recommendation
[16:33.400 --> 16:36.080]  because it puts off a lot of trichomes
[16:36.080 --> 16:38.040]  and the flavor is so delicious,
[16:38.040 --> 16:42.680]  and that flavor transfers very well with water extraction.
[16:42.680 --> 16:45.720]  So if you're using a rosin press
[16:45.720 --> 16:47.040]  or if you're making ice hash,
[16:47.040 --> 16:49.960]  the cream is the strain for you, in my opinion.
[16:49.960 --> 16:51.920]  All right, so a couple of quick grow tips
[16:51.920 --> 16:54.400]  before I wrap up my breakdown of the cream.
[16:54.400 --> 16:55.800]  The cream is going to grow tall.
[16:55.800 --> 16:57.000]  I've mentioned that a couple of times.
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.640]  It likes to skyrocket in early flower.
[16:59.640 --> 17:01.560]  You get that 21-day stretch.
[17:01.560 --> 17:04.700]  Something you can do to help prevent that,
[17:04.700 --> 17:06.000]  right before you go to flower,
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.280]  maybe a week before a flower,
[17:07.280 --> 17:09.360]  go in and pop the stems.
[17:09.360 --> 17:10.960]  I've talked about this before.
[17:10.960 --> 17:12.560]  We call it super cropping.
[17:12.560 --> 17:15.360]  You can grab the plant with one hand
[17:15.360 --> 17:17.200]  and then grab it two or three inches above that
[17:17.200 --> 17:18.840]  with the other hand and give it a little twist.
[17:18.840 --> 17:20.240]  Turn your hands opposite directions.
[17:20.240 --> 17:22.800]  You wanna break the cellulose structure of the plant.
[17:22.800 --> 17:24.840]  You want it to sound like this.
[17:24.840 --> 17:27.620]  Just give it a little twist and make it pop.
[17:27.620 --> 17:29.320]  You're gonna do a little damage.
[17:29.320 --> 17:30.240]  That's good for the plant.
[17:30.240 --> 17:31.960]  It's gonna get stronger right there.
[17:31.960 --> 17:34.320]  It's also gonna slow it down from stretching
[17:34.320 --> 17:36.720]  so that it doesn't get so darn tall
[17:36.720 --> 17:38.720]  because the cream likes to get tall on you.
[17:38.720 --> 17:40.400]  So that's a good way to slow it down
[17:40.400 --> 17:41.920]  from getting out of control.
[17:41.920 --> 17:44.220]  I also recommend having some stakes
[17:44.220 --> 17:46.720]  or some trellis or a tomato cage
[17:46.720 --> 17:48.420]  because when it starts getting tall,
[17:48.420 --> 17:51.080]  those top buds, they're gonna start swaying around
[17:51.080 --> 17:53.280]  and you're gonna wish you had supports on them.
[17:53.280 --> 17:55.440]  Also, if she starts making weird colors
[17:55.440 --> 17:57.520]  and it looks like she's got a pH issue,
[17:57.520 --> 17:58.840]  she probably doesn't.
[17:58.840 --> 18:00.740]  That's just something this plant does.
[18:00.740 --> 18:01.940]  It's one of her traits.
[18:01.940 --> 18:05.680]  She makes dark colored leaves on some phenotypes.
[18:05.680 --> 18:08.240]  She can also be very sensitive to cow mag.
[18:08.240 --> 18:10.920]  So don't overdose her on the cow mag.
[18:10.920 --> 18:12.480]  I also think she tastes better
[18:12.480 --> 18:15.080]  if you don't feed her too much nutrients.
[18:15.080 --> 18:16.920]  Most cannabis plants are that way.
[18:16.920 --> 18:19.280]  This one works well with minimal nutrients.
[18:19.280 --> 18:20.280]  You're gonna wanna beef her up.
[18:20.280 --> 18:22.540]  You're gonna wanna feed her stuff to make her go harder.
[18:22.540 --> 18:25.120]  This plant's not gonna grow gigantic colas.
[18:25.120 --> 18:26.740]  It'll grow long, skinny, tall colas,
[18:26.740 --> 18:29.200]  but it's not gonna make big, beefy colas.
[18:29.200 --> 18:30.800]  This is a connoisseur plant.
[18:30.800 --> 18:33.760]  You're gonna get more quality over quantity.
[18:33.760 --> 18:35.920]  You will get good yields.
[18:35.920 --> 18:39.120]  I can pull two pounds of light with almost every strain.
[18:39.120 --> 18:40.600]  With the cream, I can do it.
[18:40.600 --> 18:42.300]  It just takes a little bit of extra work.
[18:42.300 --> 18:44.160]  You have to do a little bit of super cropping.
[18:44.160 --> 18:45.200]  You have to do some popping.
[18:45.200 --> 18:46.400]  You have to do trellising.
[18:46.400 --> 18:47.440]  You have to work the trellis
[18:47.440 --> 18:49.400]  and work the cannabial a little bit better.
[18:49.400 --> 18:51.600]  You have to pay attention to every detail of the plant.
[18:51.600 --> 18:53.000]  You have to dial it in.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.700]  Also, if you get a little bit cold,
[18:55.700 --> 18:57.880]  this plant will slow down a little bit on you
[18:57.880 --> 18:58.800]  and it'll stop working.
[18:58.800 --> 19:00.400]  So don't get too cold at night
[19:00.400 --> 19:02.840]  or she will start stalling on you.
[19:02.840 --> 19:04.800]  All right, that is a quick breakdown
[19:04.800 --> 19:06.720]  of the cream from Iry Genetics.
[19:06.720 --> 19:08.660]  Of course, the cream is available
[19:08.660 --> 19:12.520]  at the Hella Dank Seed Company at dankseed.store.
[19:12.520 --> 19:14.520]  Don't forget about the 420 sale
[19:14.520 --> 19:18.800]  where you can buy four packs of Iry Genetic seeds for $120.
[19:18.800 --> 19:21.200]  Plus you get a free five pack.
[19:21.200 --> 19:22.760]  I will announce it here first.
[19:22.760 --> 19:25.360]  This is probably the first time you will hear this.
[19:25.360 --> 19:27.200]  You will get a free five pack
[19:27.200 --> 19:30.280]  of Cactus Cooler Cross to Arise.
[19:30.280 --> 19:32.240]  It's never been released before.
[19:32.240 --> 19:34.760]  The Hella Dank Seed Bank is the only place you can get it.
[19:34.760 --> 19:37.800]  So make sure you check them out at dankseed.store.
[19:37.800 --> 19:40.040]  That'll be for their 420 sale.
[19:40.040 --> 19:41.600]  Again, you'll get four packs,
[19:41.600 --> 19:44.160]  four five packs of Iry Genetic seeds
[19:44.160 --> 19:47.480]  plus a free five pack of Cactus Cooler to Arise
[19:47.480 --> 19:50.760]  plus another five pack that will be chosen
[19:50.760 --> 19:53.840]  by the Hella Dank Seed Bank themselves.
[19:53.840 --> 19:54.720]  That one's not up to me.
[19:54.720 --> 19:56.760]  That'll be from their existing inventory.
[19:56.760 --> 19:58.220]  It'll be an Iry Genetics pack.
[19:58.220 --> 19:59.460]  That's what I do know.
[19:59.460 --> 20:03.520]  So make sure you check out the Hella Dank Seed Bank 420 sale
[20:03.520 --> 20:05.800]  and grab some cream while you're there.
[20:05.800 --> 20:07.480]  All right, I wanna do a couple of quick shout-outs
[20:07.480 --> 20:08.480]  while I'm on a roll.
[20:08.480 --> 20:10.760]  I owe a huge shout-out to Grimbold the Druid,
[20:10.760 --> 20:13.560]  Maddie E, and of course, my buddy Tyler.
[20:13.560 --> 20:15.840]  Thanks for the love and support, you guys.
[20:15.840 --> 20:18.160]  Also, I wanna give a huge thank you
[20:18.160 --> 20:21.300]  to everybody who watches my Instagram Live videos.
[20:21.300 --> 20:25.340]  I've been having a ton of fun doing videos on Instagram Live.
[20:25.340 --> 20:26.720]  Big thank you to all my friends
[20:26.720 --> 20:28.400]  that hang out on Instagram Live.
[20:28.400 --> 20:31.000]  They chat with me, they ask me cannabis questions,
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.360]  they let me rant about growing,
[20:32.360 --> 20:33.800]  they let me rant about life.
[20:33.800 --> 20:36.240]  They inspire me, they inspire the podcast.
[20:36.240 --> 20:39.540]  They give me a lot of good material to work with.
[20:39.540 --> 20:43.180]  So thank you to everybody following my Instagram Live videos.
[20:43.180 --> 20:45.760]  If you guys wanna join me, go to Instagram,
[20:46.520 --> 20:48.080]  it's Irie underscore genetics,
[20:48.080 --> 20:52.160]  I-R-I-E underscore G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S.
[20:52.160 --> 20:54.480]  Join me for the Instagram Live videos.
[20:54.480 --> 20:56.100]  I answer live cannabis questions,
[20:56.100 --> 20:59.200]  I talk about cannabis growing, I talk about my life.
[20:59.200 --> 21:01.280]  It's just a little more freestyle than this podcast.
[21:01.280 --> 21:03.520]  There's no editing, there's no main topic.
[21:03.520 --> 21:05.080]  It's just off the top of my head.
[21:05.080 --> 21:07.320]  And it is a lot of fun for myself
[21:07.320 --> 21:09.040]  and it seems like the listeners and watchers
[21:09.040 --> 21:10.160]  are having a great time too.
[21:10.160 --> 21:12.560]  So thank you to everybody who's joining me.
[21:12.560 --> 21:13.680]  And if you're not joining me,
[21:13.680 --> 21:18.080]  I encourage you to come check out the Instagram Live videos.
[21:18.080 --> 21:19.240]  All right, podcast world,
[21:19.240 --> 21:21.800]  I hope you enjoy these strain-specific episodes,
[21:21.800 --> 21:23.600]  these strain feature podcasts.
[21:23.600 --> 21:25.960]  Send me an email, tweet me, find me on Facebook,
[21:25.960 --> 21:27.920]  let me know what you think of these episodes.
[21:27.920 --> 21:29.240]  You can find me on Facebook,
[21:29.240 --> 21:30.840]  it's Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[21:30.840 --> 21:34.000]  You can find me on Twitter, it's at G-F-Y-H Podcast.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.640]  Also, I mentioned earlier, you can find me on Instagram,
[21:36.640 --> 21:38.960]  it's Irie underscore genetics.
[21:38.960 --> 21:40.260]  And if you'd like to send me an email,
[21:40.260 --> 21:43.780]  it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[21:43.780 --> 21:45.380]  If you'd like to ask me a question,
[21:45.380 --> 21:47.740]  if you'd like to tell me what you think about these episodes,
[21:47.740 --> 21:49.740]  if you've got a product you'd like me to review,
[21:49.740 --> 21:51.980]  or if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[21:51.980 --> 21:53.820]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[21:53.820 --> 21:55.940]  is the best way to contact me.
[21:55.940 --> 21:58.380]  Of course, don't forget about Patreon.
[21:58.380 --> 22:00.980]  Patreon is a service that allows you as a listener
[22:00.980 --> 22:03.620]  to financially contribute to the podcast.
[22:03.620 --> 22:06.100]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple bucks,
[22:06.100 --> 22:08.780]  go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart,
[22:08.780 --> 22:11.740]  check out my Patreon campaign, look at my goals,
[22:11.740 --> 22:13.460]  and you can clearly see what I intend to do
[22:13.460 --> 22:15.220]  with the funding that I receive
[22:15.220 --> 22:16.620]  from my Patreon contributors.
[22:16.620 --> 22:18.460]  My MacBook is taking a poop.
[22:18.460 --> 22:20.940]  I plan on using this year's Patreon contributions
[22:20.940 --> 22:22.260]  to replace this MacBook,
[22:22.260 --> 22:23.700]  so that's where the funding will go.
[22:23.700 --> 22:25.900]  This MacBook is how the podcast happens,
[22:25.900 --> 22:28.420]  so without the MacBook, there is no podcast.
[22:28.420 --> 22:30.540]  So the people that contribute to Patreon
[22:30.540 --> 22:32.840]  will be keeping the podcast alive.
[22:32.840 --> 22:36.100]  Make sure you check it out, patreon.com slash growfromyourheart
[22:36.100 --> 22:38.020]  Big up, big thanks to everybody
[22:38.020 --> 22:40.140]  who has been supporting the Patreon campaign.
[22:40.140 --> 22:41.580]  I truly appreciate it.
[22:41.580 --> 22:43.220]  Everybody else will appreciate your help
[22:43.220 --> 22:45.220]  because it will get us a new MacBook.
[22:45.220 --> 22:49.940]  It will keep the podcast coming to everybody for free.
[22:49.940 --> 22:52.420]  You guys, if you cannot contribute to the Patreon campaign,
[22:52.420 --> 22:53.260]  do not feel bad.
[22:53.260 --> 22:54.420]  Please keep listening.
[22:54.420 --> 22:55.900]  Just keep listening to the show.
[22:55.900 --> 22:57.500]  That counts, that helps me out.
[22:57.500 --> 22:59.300]  That makes you a better cannabis grower,
[22:59.300 --> 23:00.660]  a better cannabis activist,
[23:00.660 --> 23:02.280]  it makes you a better cannabis warrior.
[23:02.280 --> 23:05.060]  So keep listening, keep supporting us that way.
[23:05.060 --> 23:06.900]  I know that not everybody is in a position
[23:06.900 --> 23:08.020]  to help out a podcast,
[23:08.020 --> 23:09.620]  but I know that some of you can do it
[23:09.620 --> 23:12.060]  and I appreciate that support.
[23:12.060 --> 23:13.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[23:13.160 --> 23:15.700]  don't forget that there is a YouTube channel.
[23:15.700 --> 23:17.820]  iTunes and Stitcher generally hold
[23:17.820 --> 23:19.900]  the 100 most recent episodes.
[23:19.900 --> 23:22.940]  So I'm trying to get all of the old episodes up on YouTube.
[23:22.940 --> 23:25.820]  So you can see we're almost to episode 300.
[23:25.820 --> 23:28.300]  So I'm trying to get the first 200 up there on YouTube
[23:28.300 --> 23:30.340]  and then you'll have 100 on iTunes.
[23:30.340 --> 23:31.820]  I'm trying to get myself caught up
[23:31.820 --> 23:33.700]  to where I'm never too far behind.
[23:33.700 --> 23:36.020]  I would like to try to get ahead of myself.
[23:36.020 --> 23:38.260]  That is a challenge when you live my life.
[23:38.260 --> 23:40.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening to the podcast.
[23:40.420 --> 23:42.340]  Thanks for listening to me ramble.
[23:42.340 --> 23:43.460]  Thanks for all of the support.
[23:43.460 --> 23:44.780]  Thanks for all of the interaction.
[23:44.780 --> 23:46.580]  My social media has been going crazy.
[23:46.580 --> 23:47.900]  My email has been exploding.
[23:47.900 --> 23:50.940]  My Instagram live videos have been getting better and better.
[23:50.940 --> 23:53.220]  I've been having way more fun with the podcast
[23:53.220 --> 23:55.140]  and with the social media than ever before
[23:55.140 --> 23:56.580]  and I owe it all to you guys.
[23:56.580 --> 23:59.140]  So huge thanks to each and every one of you.
[23:59.140 --> 24:01.500]  I will be back Thursday with the quickie episode.
[24:01.500 --> 24:03.460]  I've also got another episode planned
[24:03.460 --> 24:08.460]  and then Monday I will be back with episode number 300.
[24:08.860 --> 24:11.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for listening.
[24:11.080 --> 24:14.220]  I wanna give a huge, huge shout out to my friend Juanzilla
[24:14.220 --> 24:16.420]  and until next time, take a fat dab
[24:16.420 --> 24:17.980]  and give your mom a hug for me.
