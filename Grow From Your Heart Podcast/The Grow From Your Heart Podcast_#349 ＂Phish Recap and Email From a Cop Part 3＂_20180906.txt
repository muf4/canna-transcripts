[00:00.000 --> 00:04.760]  What's up podcast world, welcome to episode 349 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:04.760 --> 00:08.360]  No fancy intro music today, sometimes it just throws off my rhythm.
[00:08.360 --> 00:13.320]  Also sometimes it gets me messed up on YouTube and gives me a copyright notification, so
[00:13.320 --> 00:16.400]  I don't want to mess with it, I'm just going to get right to the podcast today.
[00:16.400 --> 00:18.280]  I have got some fun stuff to talk about.
[00:18.280 --> 00:21.920]  You know I like to start the show by letting you know what I am smoking on.
[00:21.920 --> 00:26.600]  Today I'm taking dabs of the Coffee Nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[00:26.600 --> 00:30.880]  We've talked about this one on the show before, it's got that dark roast coffee flavor, it's
[00:30.880 --> 00:35.680]  got a delicious aftertaste, and it's got a great high that just makes me nice and mellow,
[00:35.680 --> 00:37.240]  nice and chill.
[00:37.240 --> 00:41.120]  The high feels like it's settled in right above my eyes, kind of on my eyes, putting
[00:41.120 --> 00:44.240]  pressure on my eyes, it feels like I've got some weight on my forehead.
[00:44.240 --> 00:45.720]  It's got a super mellow high to it.
[00:45.720 --> 00:47.480]  This is going to be a fun podcast.
[00:47.480 --> 00:51.480]  So I'm smoking on the Coffee Nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[00:51.480 --> 00:55.920]  I'm sure some of you have noticed that my voice sounds a little bit funky for this episode.
[00:56.240 --> 01:01.240]  That's because I had way too much fun seeing fish for three days this weekend.
[01:01.240 --> 01:04.400]  That's right, I've been hyping it up on the podcast for a few weeks now.
[01:04.400 --> 01:07.160]  Fish, my favorite band, was in town for three nights.
[01:07.160 --> 01:09.520]  They were here Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[01:09.520 --> 01:12.720]  They were actually in Denver or Commerce City to be more specific.
[01:12.720 --> 01:17.040]  That's only about 130 miles from home, so that's a super easy three-day adventure for
[01:17.040 --> 01:18.040]  myself.
[01:18.040 --> 01:22.760]  A lot of people travel across the country to go see fish, so just 100 miles is not a
[01:22.760 --> 01:24.280]  big deal to go see this band.
[01:24.360 --> 01:27.560]  I have traveled all over the place to go see fish in the past.
[01:27.560 --> 01:31.480]  I used to pack up the old Ford Contour and rob the dude and myself.
[01:31.480 --> 01:35.800]  I would get in the car and just go drive across the country and just learn about life and
[01:35.800 --> 01:38.560]  experience the world and see fish every night.
[01:38.560 --> 01:41.040]  And then camp out or get a filthy hotel somewhere.
[01:41.040 --> 01:44.600]  Then wake up the next day, drive to the next show, and do it all over again.
[01:44.600 --> 01:45.920]  We'd do it all summer.
[01:45.920 --> 01:48.120]  Sometimes we did it all fall.
[01:48.120 --> 01:51.360]  And a lot of the time, fish would just come straight through Colorado in the winter, so
[01:51.360 --> 01:53.600]  we'd just catch them on that November run.
[01:53.640 --> 01:58.480]  But summer tour, oh man, we would pack up the car and just go for a run.
[01:58.480 --> 02:02.560]  So this year, I headed up to Denver on Friday, got to see fish.
[02:02.560 --> 02:04.400]  It was super easy getting there.
[02:04.400 --> 02:05.400]  Parking was super simple.
[02:05.400 --> 02:09.160]  Got in, got to have a good time on the parking lot, got to take some dabs in the lot, got
[02:09.160 --> 02:13.200]  in, got to see the show, got to sit with some of our friends from Comedy Works for the show,
[02:13.200 --> 02:16.020]  so that's always a good time, hanging out with the Comedy Works crew.
[02:16.020 --> 02:17.360]  Got to hang out and enjoy the fish show.
[02:17.360 --> 02:18.480]  They played a bunch of great songs.
[02:18.480 --> 02:21.080]  You guys probably don't want to hear about the song titles and stuff, and if you care
[02:21.080 --> 02:23.640]  enough, you've probably already seen the set list.
[02:23.640 --> 02:26.840]  So shout out to my friends from Comedy Works for hanging out on the first night.
[02:26.840 --> 02:30.400]  The second night, I went back to that area, looking to see if I could see some friends.
[02:30.400 --> 02:31.400]  I saw some friends.
[02:31.400 --> 02:32.680]  I grabbed some seats with them.
[02:32.680 --> 02:33.680]  We hung out.
[02:33.680 --> 02:34.680]  We smoked.
[02:34.680 --> 02:35.680]  The band started.
[02:35.680 --> 02:36.840]  It got too crowded right there.
[02:36.840 --> 02:37.840]  I wanted to dance.
[02:37.840 --> 02:38.840]  I wanted to boogie.
[02:38.840 --> 02:40.640]  They were playing really good songs that night.
[02:40.640 --> 02:42.000]  They had a different sound that night.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.240]  It's not uncommon for fish to have a different sound every night.
[02:45.240 --> 02:46.240]  They kind of have a different vibe.
[02:46.240 --> 02:47.640]  They came out with different energy.
[02:47.640 --> 02:49.360]  I wanted to get down and dance.
[02:49.360 --> 02:50.360]  I kind of loosened up.
[02:50.360 --> 02:52.440]  I was enjoying my weekend.
[02:52.440 --> 02:55.840]  So I decided that I was going to abandon the pretty good seats that I had with some friends,
[02:55.840 --> 03:00.020]  and I was going to go find some space by myself to where I could stretch my long hippie arms
[03:00.020 --> 03:01.580]  out and dance a little bit.
[03:01.580 --> 03:03.760]  So I found a section where there weren't any people.
[03:03.760 --> 03:04.760]  There were just no people there.
[03:04.760 --> 03:08.360]  I kind of went there and kind of just started grooving and seeing if anybody would kick
[03:08.360 --> 03:09.360]  me out.
[03:09.360 --> 03:12.920]  Nobody said anything about me standing in this big empty aisle area just dancing like
[03:12.920 --> 03:13.920]  a hippie.
[03:13.920 --> 03:17.160]  So I'm just spinning around dancing, and next thing I know, a bunch of other hippies have
[03:17.160 --> 03:19.680]  gathered around, and we're all just having a good time right there.
[03:19.680 --> 03:23.600]  So section 104 became kind of a little dance party up at the top.
[03:23.600 --> 03:26.840]  It's fun to be down in the front where the band is real loud and all the energy is down
[03:26.840 --> 03:27.840]  there, but it's a little crowded.
[03:27.840 --> 03:30.000]  I'm kind of a big dude, and I got long-ass dreadlocks.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.680]  I'm spilling people's beer with my dreads and shit, and people are getting frustrated
[03:33.680 --> 03:35.900]  at how tall I am, and I want to dance like a wook.
[03:35.900 --> 03:38.440]  So I went to the back and had a really good time.
[03:38.440 --> 03:40.720]  I made a bunch of friends.
[03:40.720 --> 03:44.360]  So Sunday night, I decided to go back there.
[03:44.360 --> 03:45.360]  Why waste time?
[03:45.360 --> 03:47.040]  I wanted to get back to where I knew there was a party.
[03:47.040 --> 03:50.120]  I didn't have to fight for a seat because it's just standing space right there anyway,
[03:50.120 --> 03:51.440]  so you can go in late.
[03:51.440 --> 03:55.680]  You just go in right before the show starts, go grab a drink, go get comfortable right
[03:55.680 --> 03:56.680]  there.
[03:56.680 --> 03:58.840]  The lights go out, the music starts, you smoke a little bit, and have a good time.
[03:58.840 --> 04:03.940]  So I found that spot and made some new friends there and had a really good time.
[04:03.940 --> 04:08.000]  So Fish plays for about, they come out, they play for about an hour, then they take like
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.320]  a 20 or 30 minute break.
[04:09.320 --> 04:12.360]  They come out and they do like another hour and a half, and then they do an encore after
[04:12.360 --> 04:13.360]  that.
[04:13.360 --> 04:14.360]  So they came out, they did their first hour.
[04:14.360 --> 04:15.360]  They're like, oh, they're getting down.
[04:15.360 --> 04:19.680]  There are a couple other people getting down next to me and at set break, I started conversation
[04:19.680 --> 04:21.800]  with some of them.
[04:21.800 --> 04:25.680]  This young lady that I had been dancing kind of with, kind of right next to for about an
[04:25.680 --> 04:31.240]  hour now, in conversation, I found out that she was in one of my favorite movies.
[04:31.240 --> 04:35.160]  And I didn't even realize it the whole time I'd been standing next to her and for the
[04:35.160 --> 04:39.160]  whole concert so far, I didn't even realize that this was an actress in one of my favorite
[04:39.160 --> 04:40.160]  movies.
[04:40.160 --> 04:45.600]  And I found out just through casual conversation that she played a part in a movie I've seen
[04:45.600 --> 04:48.400]  a thousand times.
[04:48.400 --> 04:52.160]  So I had to act like I was not starstruck and had to keep the conversation going.
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.320]  But then the band came back out and they killed it for the second half of Sunday.
[04:56.320 --> 04:59.880]  The whole weekend was great, but Sunday was my favorite of all three shows.
[04:59.880 --> 05:02.160]  They always say never miss a Sunday show.
[05:02.160 --> 05:05.340]  The first half of Sunday, they played some great songs.
[05:05.340 --> 05:09.160]  The second half of Sunday, they played great songs and the jams were insane.
[05:09.160 --> 05:11.640]  So Sunday was a great show.
[05:11.640 --> 05:17.000]  Then we walked out of the show after the show was over and there was a marching band playing
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.400]  fish tunes.
[05:18.400 --> 05:22.140]  There's a dude with a giant bass drum beating the bass drum with malice.
[05:22.140 --> 05:23.980]  There's a guy with a marching snare.
[05:23.980 --> 05:28.360]  There were a couple other guys with percussion instruments and then a nice horn section blowing
[05:28.360 --> 05:31.320]  out fish tunes on horns, New Orleans style.
[05:31.320 --> 05:32.600]  It was super cool.
[05:32.600 --> 05:34.200]  We got down to that for a long time.
[05:34.200 --> 05:37.720]  We just stood in the parking lot and just danced to that, smoked a couple of joints,
[05:37.720 --> 05:39.720]  did a vape pin a bunch of times.
[05:39.720 --> 05:43.320]  Just watched everybody be hippies, watch everybody do nitrous and whatever else they were doing
[05:43.320 --> 05:46.400]  and run around like wooks and have a good time.
[05:46.400 --> 05:47.640]  Everybody was just grooving in that area.
[05:47.640 --> 05:49.760]  It was so much fun.
[05:49.760 --> 05:54.120]  Ate some parking lot pizza, had some parking lot burritos, had a good time there.
[05:54.120 --> 06:00.040]  Then the marching band ended and we discovered the ball pit car.
[06:00.040 --> 06:02.840]  I've known about the ball pit car since I lived in Lawrence, Kansas.
[06:02.840 --> 06:06.040]  The guys that own the ball pit car were actually friends of mine in Lawrence.
[06:06.040 --> 06:07.320]  I guess they're actually still friends of mine.
[06:07.920 --> 06:11.440]  I shouldn't say were friends of mine, but these guys have known them since Lawrence, Kansas.
[06:11.440 --> 06:12.440]  They've got a car.
[06:12.440 --> 06:14.640]  I think it's like a truck.
[06:14.640 --> 06:16.680]  It's sort of like an El Camino or a Ranchero.
[06:16.680 --> 06:18.640]  I'm not exactly sure what it is.
[06:18.640 --> 06:21.420]  It's like a small truck with a long bed.
[06:21.420 --> 06:23.080]  They put a little liner inside of there.
[06:23.080 --> 06:25.560]  They put a little net around the thing.
[06:25.560 --> 06:30.040]  You'd put a low net, like you'd put around a trampoline so nobody flies out of it.
[06:30.040 --> 06:31.600]  They put that net around there.
[06:31.600 --> 06:36.440]  Then they filled the bed of the truck type vehicle with the balls that you'd put in a
[06:36.560 --> 06:38.280]  ball pit at Chuck E. Cheese.
[06:38.280 --> 06:40.000]  So it is a ball pit car.
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.780]  You can drive it and have the ball pit active, but they park it.
[06:43.780 --> 06:46.040]  They set up a pretty dope sound system.
[06:46.040 --> 06:49.960]  They hang a disco ball up above the center of the ball pit and people dance around the
[06:49.960 --> 06:52.240]  car while the cool music plays.
[06:52.240 --> 06:55.000]  They play a lot of talking heads to tell you the honest truth.
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.360]  They dance around the car and then people dive into the ball pit and roll around in
[06:59.360 --> 07:00.360]  the ball pit.
[07:00.360 --> 07:01.360]  It's just a good time.
[07:01.360 --> 07:04.400]  It's just a fun little thing to have, kind of a sideshow attraction at the Fish Show.
[07:04.400 --> 07:06.800]  They're not involved with the show or anything.
[07:06.800 --> 07:09.320]  That's the beauty and the magic of the Fish parking lot.
[07:09.320 --> 07:11.200]  None of that is organized.
[07:11.200 --> 07:16.120]  That's just all done by Fish Kids that have been going to Fish Shows for years and years
[07:16.120 --> 07:17.120]  and years.
[07:17.120 --> 07:20.680]  We've picked up the culture from the Grateful Dead where when the band goes on tour, you
[07:20.680 --> 07:23.040]  buy your tickets before they go on tour.
[07:23.040 --> 07:25.520]  So if they're going on summer tour, you get your tickets in the spring.
[07:25.520 --> 07:27.520]  You start booking all your hotels and all your camping.
[07:27.520 --> 07:30.920]  And then when the band goes out, you've got the car packed and you just go to every show.
[07:30.920 --> 07:32.320]  You go to California.
[07:32.320 --> 07:33.320]  You go Oregon.
[07:33.320 --> 07:34.320]  Then you go down to Vegas.
[07:34.320 --> 07:35.320]  Then you come through Colorado.
[07:35.320 --> 07:36.640]  And then you go wherever they go next.
[07:36.640 --> 07:38.320]  You just travel around with them.
[07:38.320 --> 07:41.040]  So people have figured out ways how to support themselves.
[07:41.040 --> 07:42.960]  Yes, people do sell drugs.
[07:42.960 --> 07:43.960]  That's common.
[07:43.960 --> 07:44.960]  It's also very risky.
[07:44.960 --> 07:45.960]  You can also sell food.
[07:45.960 --> 07:46.960]  You can sell shirts.
[07:46.960 --> 07:52.240]  A lot of people are selling hats, fish hats, grassroots hats, other random hats.
[07:52.240 --> 07:53.240]  There are people selling crystals.
[07:53.240 --> 07:54.840]  There are people selling paintings.
[07:54.840 --> 07:56.840]  There's a lot of artwork on the lot.
[07:56.840 --> 07:59.100]  A lot of just people selling alcohol.
[07:59.100 --> 08:00.100]  They set up a table.
[08:00.100 --> 08:04.580]  So you can, and a lot of places won't allow us to do this.
[08:04.580 --> 08:07.380]  When we've gone to other states and other cities, we've been in trouble for doing this
[08:07.380 --> 08:08.380]  and they shut us down.
[08:08.380 --> 08:11.340]  But the city of commerce city was very kind to us this time.
[08:11.340 --> 08:12.580]  I guess I should give them a shout out.
[08:12.580 --> 08:16.260]  They'll never hear this, but I think it's fucking cool that they allowed us to do this.
[08:16.260 --> 08:22.340]  On the premises at Dick's in the parking lot, there's a big dirt parking lot area.
[08:22.340 --> 08:28.300]  They let a bunch of people set up tables and basically little pop-up tents, little pop-ups
[08:28.300 --> 08:31.660]  like you'd have at any other, like a chili cook-off festival or whatever kind of festival
[08:31.660 --> 08:34.980]  you have downtown in your city when everybody just, or the cannabis cup, we all just bring
[08:34.980 --> 08:35.980]  a pop-up, right?
[08:35.980 --> 08:37.180]  And you set up under that.
[08:37.180 --> 08:39.940]  People bring that, they set up their grill and they sell grilled cheese sandwiches.
[08:39.940 --> 08:40.940]  You could get pizza.
[08:40.940 --> 08:42.220]  You could get fajitas.
[08:42.220 --> 08:43.220]  You could eat out there.
[08:43.220 --> 08:45.260]  You could live out there on that parking lot.
[08:45.260 --> 08:46.780]  There's alcohol for days.
[08:46.780 --> 08:50.620]  You could get any kind of drink concoction you wanted out there.
[08:50.620 --> 08:52.040]  You could get fresh margaritas.
[08:52.040 --> 08:53.120]  You could get PBR.
[08:53.120 --> 08:54.900]  You could get anything in between there.
[08:54.900 --> 08:56.240]  You can get a dank dark beer.
[08:56.240 --> 09:00.780]  You could get a dollar beer, a shitty beer for a dollar, good beer for three bucks or
[09:00.780 --> 09:01.780]  two for five.
[09:01.780 --> 09:02.840]  Just depends on what you want to spend.
[09:02.840 --> 09:06.600]  You could eat like a king or you could eat like a fucking dirty hippie out there.
[09:06.600 --> 09:07.600]  It's all there.
[09:07.600 --> 09:11.960]  And it's all brought by kids who have been going to a lot of shows and have learned that
[09:11.960 --> 09:15.280]  they want to fund their way in sort of a productive way.
[09:15.280 --> 09:16.280]  They're providing a service.
[09:16.280 --> 09:19.440]  I got to eat because that dude was selling pizza and he got to go to the next show because
[09:19.440 --> 09:21.880]  I spent six or seven bucks at his booth.
[09:21.880 --> 09:22.880]  So it kind of works out.
[09:22.880 --> 09:26.240]  We set up a little community there and Commerce City let us do it.
[09:26.240 --> 09:29.840]  They let us set up our booths and vend and they let us just march around and be hippies
[09:29.840 --> 09:32.600]  for three full days and they didn't bug us at all.
[09:32.600 --> 09:34.120]  So that was super cool.
[09:34.120 --> 09:37.280]  If you guys watched any of my Instagram live feed, you may have seen some of the footage
[09:37.280 --> 09:39.560]  from the fish parking lot party.
[09:39.560 --> 09:43.680]  I was walking around and then I showed a little bit of the ball pit car party, but I was having
[09:43.680 --> 09:46.760]  conversation with some new friends and I just wanted to end the live feed and get back to
[09:46.760 --> 09:47.920]  the conversation.
[09:47.920 --> 09:49.720]  So there wasn't much footage there.
[09:49.720 --> 09:51.420]  You guys put your phone away and just enjoy the moment.
[09:51.420 --> 09:52.560]  It's way more fun.
[09:53.440 --> 09:57.000]  I appreciate the moments that I've got in my head more than the shit that I've got on
[09:57.000 --> 09:58.000]  my phone.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.520]  The shit on my phone, I just recorded that and I wasn't even in the moment.
[10:00.520 --> 10:02.360]  The stuff that I enjoyed, I enjoyed it.
[10:02.360 --> 10:03.360]  It's all in here.
[10:03.360 --> 10:04.360]  So put your phone away, you guys.
[10:04.360 --> 10:08.720]  All right, I've only got a couple more things I'm going to talk about about the fish weekend
[10:08.720 --> 10:10.000]  before I move forward.
[10:10.000 --> 10:11.920]  I've got parking lot fun written down.
[10:11.920 --> 10:13.860]  The parking lot's awesome, you guys.
[10:13.860 --> 10:16.520]  You can buy food, you can buy drinks, you can buy drugs, you can get hugs, you can meet
[10:16.520 --> 10:20.840]  up with your friends, you can get some high fives, you can make new friends, you can see
[10:20.840 --> 10:22.400]  old friends.
[10:23.240 --> 10:25.720]  One cool thing about the parking lot is I was walking around doing laps, just seeing
[10:25.720 --> 10:28.880]  people, listening to all the music that people are playing, seeing what all the hippies are
[10:28.880 --> 10:30.440]  selling, seeing what's available.
[10:30.440 --> 10:35.400]  I walked past the concert venue where the band was going to play, and on Sunday, I got
[10:35.400 --> 10:38.240]  there really early, and they were doing sound check.
[10:38.240 --> 10:42.680]  The band was checking the sound and playing with their instruments and playing with their
[10:42.680 --> 10:46.240]  gear on stage, getting warmed up for the show that night just to make sure all the equipment
[10:46.240 --> 10:47.240]  sounds good.
[10:47.240 --> 10:49.800]  Sometimes you want to go out on stage and jam a couple new songs.
[10:49.800 --> 10:52.160]  I got to hear a really old song.
[10:52.200 --> 10:53.400]  They don't play very often.
[10:53.400 --> 10:57.880]  You guys don't care what it was, but it was really cool to hear a song that they don't
[10:57.880 --> 10:58.880]  play very often.
[10:58.880 --> 11:01.640]  They played a jam out of it, and then they ended that, and then they kind of tinkered
[11:01.640 --> 11:04.840]  with their instruments, and they just kept playing, just like little short jams.
[11:04.840 --> 11:08.880]  I think the keyboard player was trying to dial in a new sound on his keyboard, so they
[11:08.880 --> 11:11.880]  would play for a few seconds, and he would do his little keyboard part, and then they'd
[11:11.880 --> 11:15.600]  stop, and then you'd hear him, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, and kind of tweak the
[11:15.600 --> 11:18.280]  sound a little bit, and then they'd go back to playing it again.
[11:18.280 --> 11:20.920]  It was super cool hearing them do sound check.
[11:20.920 --> 11:24.920]  They played a really old song that they don't play on stage.
[11:24.920 --> 11:28.520]  I've never heard Phish do it live in the hundreds of years I've been listening to Phish.
[11:28.520 --> 11:29.520]  I've been listening to tapes.
[11:29.520 --> 11:31.040]  I've been paying attention to live stuff.
[11:31.040 --> 11:36.520]  They've never done it that I've paid attention to, and they played part of it in a jam during
[11:36.520 --> 11:41.600]  sound check, and we all applauded at the end of it, and Trey, the singer, laughed, and
[11:41.600 --> 11:45.640]  he goes, ha ha, this is a little song called Catapult, and it's just really awesome that
[11:45.640 --> 11:49.360]  they played that one, and then he acknowledged us for laughing or for applauding about it,
[11:49.360 --> 11:50.360]  so that was super cool.
[11:50.360 --> 11:52.960]  Then, what else do I have written down?
[11:52.960 --> 11:56.640]  I met some cool people, and I ran into some familiar people, so I want to give a couple
[11:56.640 --> 11:58.080]  of people some shout-outs.
[11:58.080 --> 11:59.720]  I owe Cindy Sue a shout-out.
[11:59.720 --> 12:02.520]  I bumped into somebody who calls himself Cindy Sue.
[12:02.520 --> 12:07.120]  Super shy, but seemed like a very great person, so big shout-out to Cindy Sue.
[12:07.120 --> 12:08.880]  Next time, stick around a little longer.
[12:08.880 --> 12:10.640]  Also, a big shout-out to Chris Chiari.
[12:10.640 --> 12:12.200]  I hope I'm saying that right, dude.
[12:12.200 --> 12:13.200]  Haven't seen you in a long time.
[12:13.200 --> 12:15.160]  It was great to bump into you at a Phish show.
[12:15.160 --> 12:17.720]  I should have known I would see you there.
[12:17.720 --> 12:21.320]  Also, big shout-out to my friends from Comedy Works, Jesse and Baker.
[12:21.320 --> 12:23.040]  I love you guys all the time.
[12:23.040 --> 12:25.520]  Thanks for always taking good care of me.
[12:25.520 --> 12:31.320]  One night, I had the honor of meeting a couple who run a hemp company called Vita Mia Hemp.
[12:31.320 --> 12:36.000]  They were great to talk to, very enthusiastic cannabis farmers.
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.520]  They're hemp farmers.
[12:37.520 --> 12:39.460]  She is a podcast listener.
[12:39.460 --> 12:41.960]  She is a very passionate farmer.
[12:41.960 --> 12:46.000]  People say that I light up when I talk about cannabis, and I saw that same light in this
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  young lady's eyes.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.560]  When she would talk about cannabis, her eyes would twinkle like it was the best thing ever.
[12:50.560 --> 12:56.040]  It was fun having a conversation with somebody who loves cannabis as much as I do.
[12:56.040 --> 12:59.640]  I got to take a great picture with her, so that was a great time.
[12:59.640 --> 13:00.640]  Thanks for introducing yourself.
[13:00.640 --> 13:03.680]  Thanks for stopping and saying hi, and thanks for the great conversation.
[13:03.680 --> 13:09.400]  I look forward to visiting the Vita Mia Hemp farm one of these days soon.
[13:09.400 --> 13:12.280]  You guys, somebody else sent me a message, and they said, hey, I saw you at Phish, but
[13:12.280 --> 13:15.040]  I didn't want to interrupt you because you were talking to somebody.
[13:15.080 --> 13:18.320]  I was probably talking to Vita Mia Hemp because I spent a lot of time with them, and it was
[13:18.320 --> 13:22.080]  awesome, but if we're at a Phish show, and you walk by, and you want to introduce yourself
[13:22.080 --> 13:25.760]  and say hi to me, if we know each other, if we've never met, if we're longtime friends,
[13:25.760 --> 13:28.360]  if you want to be new friends, it's a Phish show.
[13:28.360 --> 13:32.240]  As long as the band is not playing, stop and say hello.
[13:32.240 --> 13:33.480]  It's a social event.
[13:33.480 --> 13:34.480]  Be social.
[13:34.480 --> 13:35.480]  We're there to hang out.
[13:35.480 --> 13:38.000]  We're there to make friends and have friends and be a good time.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.880]  Introduce yourself, or even if the person that said they saw me and didn't want to interrupt,
[13:41.880 --> 13:43.600]  they're an old friend, and I haven't seen them in a long time.
[13:43.600 --> 13:46.280]  It would have been pretty cool to see and get a hug.
[13:46.280 --> 13:48.160]  Just stop and say what's up at a Phish show.
[13:48.160 --> 13:50.320]  I'm not that shy, and it's a Phish show.
[13:50.320 --> 13:53.860]  I do wear a shirt that says, don't talk to me while Phish is playing.
[13:53.860 --> 13:57.780]  While the band is playing, you should be dancing and letting all your problems escape your
[13:57.780 --> 14:01.480]  mind and set your soul free and cleanse your shit and have a good time, and I'm going to
[14:01.480 --> 14:04.360]  do the same thing, but as soon as they're done, let's smoke a joint and talk about all
[14:04.360 --> 14:05.360]  the stuff that's on your mind.
[14:05.360 --> 14:06.800]  I'm down with that.
[14:06.800 --> 14:08.300]  Introduce yourself and say hi.
[14:08.300 --> 14:09.360]  Don't be shy.
[14:09.360 --> 14:10.440]  Introduce yourself at a Phish show.
[14:10.440 --> 14:11.440]  Don't be that person.
[14:11.440 --> 14:13.040]  I want to meet each and every one of you.
[14:13.040 --> 14:14.040]  Let's hang out.
[14:14.040 --> 14:18.520]  I'll probably smoke a joint with you if I've got one left, and that's a good segue to talk
[14:18.520 --> 14:22.480]  about the last part of my Phish talk for this podcast.
[14:22.480 --> 14:24.800]  It's Colorado, right?
[14:24.800 --> 14:25.800]  Cannabis is legal here.
[14:25.800 --> 14:26.800]  We can all consume cannabis.
[14:26.800 --> 14:28.800]  If we're 21 and over, we can possess, consume.
[14:28.800 --> 14:30.320]  We can enjoy our cannabis.
[14:30.320 --> 14:34.480]  However, you cannot take your cannabis into the concert venue.
[14:34.480 --> 14:39.680]  Dick's Sporting Goods Stadium, whatever it's called, Dick's Sporting Goods Field.
[14:39.680 --> 14:40.680]  That sounds better.
[14:40.680 --> 14:41.680]  Dick's Sporting Goods Field.
[14:41.680 --> 14:42.880]  It's a giant soccer field.
[14:43.720 --> 14:48.480]  They do not invite you or encourage you or allow you to bring in your cannabis or cannabis
[14:48.480 --> 14:49.480]  products.
[14:49.480 --> 14:52.840]  They were doing a very light search on the way into the show.
[14:52.840 --> 14:57.480]  They had a metal detector, and you've got to take out all of your metal, your phone,
[14:57.480 --> 15:01.000]  your lighter, your car keys, and put that in a little basket, and they slide that through
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.200]  a little thing that goes past the metal detector so it doesn't trigger it.
[15:04.200 --> 15:07.840]  Then you walk through, and if it doesn't beep, you're good to go.
[15:07.840 --> 15:13.560]  If you've got a joint or a bunch of joints or a baggie of weed in your pocket, you're
[15:13.560 --> 15:14.880]  going to sneak right through that thing.
[15:14.880 --> 15:16.120]  It didn't care about that at all.
[15:16.120 --> 15:18.800]  I took several joints every night into the show.
[15:18.800 --> 15:23.640]  However, if you had a backpack or some sort of a purse, they'd make you open your purse
[15:23.640 --> 15:27.280]  and unzip all the pouches in the purse, and they'd go through that shit.
[15:27.280 --> 15:28.920]  The line was long, and there were a lot of people.
[15:28.920 --> 15:31.440]  I watched a lot of people get a lot of shit taken from them.
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.440]  Ah, they would open up your purse, and they would find a lot of vape pens.
[15:35.440 --> 15:39.280]  You couldn't take in a nicotine or a cannabis vape pen.
[15:39.280 --> 15:40.760]  They didn't want those in there.
[15:40.760 --> 15:44.720]  If they found that, they'd give you the option to walk back to your car and put it away,
[15:44.720 --> 15:49.000]  or they wanted you to throw it in a trash bag that was right there on the ground, and
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.440]  that bag was full.
[15:50.440 --> 15:52.320]  A couple of people were smart.
[15:52.320 --> 15:55.400]  When they found their vape pens, and they didn't want to walk back to their car, they're
[15:55.400 --> 15:56.560]  like, well, you can't throw it away.
[15:56.560 --> 16:00.880]  They would take a big-ass ripoff of it and then pass it to the person in line behind
[16:00.880 --> 16:03.840]  them, and that person would hit it and then just pass it back.
[16:03.840 --> 16:07.160]  That vape pen would get consumed instead of being thrown away, which I thought was
[16:07.160 --> 16:08.160]  very smart.
[16:08.160 --> 16:11.960]  I actually got to hit one of the vape pens that was discovered by security, and before
[16:11.960 --> 16:15.920]  that person threw it into the trash bag, they passed it into the people in line, and I was
[16:15.920 --> 16:19.040]  like the second or third person in line, so it went to one person, and then it came to
[16:19.040 --> 16:22.960]  me, and I took a big, fat ripoff of it, and then I just passed that vape pen down the
[16:22.960 --> 16:23.960]  line.
[16:23.960 --> 16:24.960]  It got smoked.
[16:24.960 --> 16:25.960]  It didn't go in the trash.
[16:25.960 --> 16:29.960]  It didn't make it into the show, however, but all you had to do was put it in your pocket.
[16:29.960 --> 16:33.320]  You could load your pockets up with stuff, and you could take it right into the show.
[16:33.320 --> 16:34.320]  There were plenty of vape pens.
[16:34.320 --> 16:35.480]  There was plenty of whatever in there.
[16:35.480 --> 16:37.200]  I smelled people smoking DMT in there.
[16:37.200 --> 16:39.720]  I smelled people smoking plenty of weed in there.
[16:39.720 --> 16:45.480]  I could see the looks on people's faces that plenty of shit made it past security, but
[16:45.480 --> 16:52.360]  the lady in line in front of me on Sunday did not get her mountain of fucking edibles
[16:52.360 --> 16:53.360]  through security.
[16:53.360 --> 16:54.360]  I don't know what she was thinking.
[16:54.360 --> 16:58.960]  She had a little purse, and when he opened it up, they sell edibles in Colorado, and
[16:58.960 --> 17:00.320]  it's like a giant film canister.
[17:00.320 --> 17:02.720]  It's a childproof container, semi-childproof.
[17:02.720 --> 17:08.720]  She squeezed it, and the lid pops open, but they sell you edibles in these types of containers,
[17:08.720 --> 17:10.560]  and this lady had like six of them in her purse.
[17:10.560 --> 17:14.360]  The guy opens the purse, and he just grabs them, and he goes, these aren't going in,
[17:14.360 --> 17:17.920]  and her husband or boyfriend or whatever had already made it through security, so he's
[17:17.920 --> 17:18.920]  already in the show.
[17:18.920 --> 17:23.000]  The security guard's like, you got to take these back to the car or throw them away right
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.920]  here in front of me, and she just grabs them and stuffs them in her purse, and she's pissed
[17:25.920 --> 17:30.080]  off because she's got to go figure this out, and her husband's in the show now, but that
[17:30.080 --> 17:32.360]  security was not letting her through with those.
[17:32.360 --> 17:35.720]  I don't know what happened with the edibles, but they would not let you through with edibles.
[17:35.720 --> 17:38.840]  If they discovered them, they would not let you through with them.
[17:38.840 --> 17:43.080]  I had two water bottles in my pocket, and security didn't even notice that, so if you
[17:43.080 --> 17:47.840]  were discreet, you could probably get through there with whatever you wanted if it wasn't metal.
[17:47.840 --> 17:50.640]  I don't know how the vape pens weren't setting off the metal detectors.
[17:50.640 --> 17:56.280]  I saw a bunch of the Green Dot vape pens in the show, so they were making it through security.
[17:56.280 --> 17:59.000]  I also ran into one of the Green Dot reps.
[17:59.000 --> 18:00.000]  What's up, bro?
[18:00.000 --> 18:01.000]  I hope you're listening to the podcast.
[18:01.000 --> 18:02.720]  I'm good talking with you about Green Dot products.
[18:02.720 --> 18:05.080]  All right, you guys, that's enough talking about fish.
[18:05.080 --> 18:09.560]  I probably just bored the shit out of everybody for like 15 minutes, but it's a Thursday episode.
[18:09.560 --> 18:11.400]  You knew this was coming.
[18:11.400 --> 18:14.800]  You guys knew I just went and saw fish all weekend, so you knew I had to talk about it.
[18:14.800 --> 18:18.040]  I promise you that I've got a whole bunch of great grow lessons coming up.
[18:18.040 --> 18:21.680]  I keep saying that, but this fish vacation was what I was waiting for.
[18:21.680 --> 18:23.520]  I wanted to get this out of the way.
[18:23.520 --> 18:26.960]  This was my big release and my recharge, so I'm refreshed.
[18:26.960 --> 18:27.960]  I'm ready to go.
[18:27.960 --> 18:30.280]  I've got a bunch of great episodes written.
[18:30.280 --> 18:34.880]  You are going to get overloaded with grow information coming up very soon.
[18:34.880 --> 18:36.280]  I promise you that.
[18:36.280 --> 18:38.520]  The next episode is number 350.
[18:38.520 --> 18:40.200]  I'm not sure what I'm going to do.
[18:40.200 --> 18:42.560]  I've been trying to get Mike over to do some recording.
[18:42.560 --> 18:43.760]  I'm not blaming Mike.
[18:43.760 --> 18:45.040]  I'm not calling Mike out.
[18:45.040 --> 18:47.200]  I'm just saying he's a new father.
[18:47.200 --> 18:48.360]  It's hard to ... Not a new father.
[18:48.360 --> 18:49.880]  He's a new father again.
[18:49.880 --> 18:55.320]  He's double timing it up, so he can't come over as frequently as I'd like him to to record.
[18:55.320 --> 18:58.440]  If I can get him here, Mike and I will record episode 350 together.
[18:58.600 --> 19:00.800]  If not, of course, it's just going to be me by myself.
[19:00.800 --> 19:05.320]  Then after that, you guys, it is going to be grow school time.
[19:05.320 --> 19:08.120]  You'll have to get out your notebook and do some learning with me.
[19:08.120 --> 19:10.880]  Take you guys to Rasta Jeff's Cannabis School.
[19:10.880 --> 19:12.480]  Get back to the education part of the show.
[19:12.480 --> 19:14.200]  Anyway, you guys, I'm fucking rambling today.
[19:14.200 --> 19:16.680]  I feel like those coffee nectar dabs are starting to wear off.
[19:16.680 --> 19:19.040]  I may have to do another dab here pretty soon.
[19:19.040 --> 19:22.600]  But before we do that, let's get to the tweeter part of the show.
[19:22.600 --> 19:28.160]  A few episodes back, I asked you if you could smoke a joint with anybody, who would it be?
[19:28.160 --> 19:31.880]  I got a lot of great twitter replies.
[19:31.880 --> 19:38.320]  A lot of people said they would like to smoke with their father who has passed away.
[19:38.320 --> 19:42.840]  I kind of honestly expected that answer from a lot of folk, because that just seems like
[19:42.840 --> 19:46.920]  something that a lot of people would have wanted to do, like an opportunity maybe a
[19:46.920 --> 19:49.360]  lot of young men were looking for that they never got.
[19:49.360 --> 19:51.680]  That would have been a really an opening opportunity.
[19:51.680 --> 19:55.800]  It would have been a good icebreaker for maybe a couple of men who didn't get along.
[19:55.800 --> 19:59.000]  You could consume some cannabis together and loosen up, and then you don't have to
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.520]  be macho with each other.
[20:00.520 --> 20:04.320]  That may have helped out with a lot of male relationships.
[20:04.320 --> 20:10.040]  Big respect to everybody who reached out and said that their choice of who they would smoke
[20:10.040 --> 20:14.140]  with dead or alive was their father who has passed, because that probably took some courage
[20:14.140 --> 20:15.360]  to reach out and say that.
[20:15.360 --> 20:16.960]  That's probably a sensitive moment.
[20:16.960 --> 20:18.280]  Thank you for sharing that with me.
[20:18.280 --> 20:24.260]  I'm going to try to dig in here and find a few more of those replies.
[20:24.260 --> 20:27.460]  Before I read the replies, I'll actually read the tweet that I tweeted.
[20:27.460 --> 20:30.900]  On Twitter, I said, if you could smoke a joint with any person living or dead, who would
[20:30.900 --> 20:32.100]  you choose?
[20:32.100 --> 20:37.260]  If the person you chose has passed, which era of that person's life would you reanimate
[20:37.260 --> 20:38.260]  them from?
[20:38.260 --> 20:45.420]  As an example, I said Jerry Garcia circa 1977, because if you think about it, if I said,
[20:45.420 --> 20:48.900]  I want to smoke a joint with Jerry Garcia, right now if you dug Jerry Garcia up and let
[20:48.900 --> 20:51.940]  me smoke a joint with him, he had so many years of his life.
[20:51.940 --> 20:52.940]  I think he lived 53 years.
[20:53.620 --> 20:54.620]  He got a lot of opportunity.
[20:54.620 --> 20:57.020]  Do you want to smoke with him as a little kid when he didn't know shit about the guitar?
[20:57.020 --> 20:59.260]  Do you want to smoke with him at the height of his career?
[20:59.260 --> 21:02.540]  Do you want to smoke with him at the end, right before he died when he had all of the
[21:02.540 --> 21:03.540]  knowledge?
[21:03.540 --> 21:04.540]  Which option?
[21:04.540 --> 21:07.460]  I said circa 1977.
[21:07.460 --> 21:11.420]  At one point in Jerry's life, I think it was around the mid 80s, about 84, Jerry slipped
[21:11.420 --> 21:12.900]  into a diabetic coma.
[21:12.900 --> 21:14.700]  He changed.
[21:14.700 --> 21:17.140]  I would like to talk to Jerry before that coma.
[21:17.140 --> 21:21.620]  Also, if I was going to smoke with Jerry, I'd want to do it when he's young and hip
[21:21.780 --> 21:23.660]  and fucking kind of my age I am now.
[21:23.660 --> 21:26.860]  I think that was around 77.
[21:26.860 --> 21:33.700]  Jerry Garcia around 77 or my other example was my gramps in 1995-ish, that era.
[21:33.700 --> 21:35.300]  That's when my gramps and I were really clicking.
[21:35.300 --> 21:40.060]  I was adult enough, I think, to have a good conversation with the old man.
[21:40.060 --> 21:44.300]  He was still healthy enough to have a good conversation with the young man.
[21:44.300 --> 21:46.500]  We were getting along really well at that point.
[21:46.820 --> 21:51.940]  So if I could smoke a joint with any person, living or dead, it'd be a tough choice between
[21:51.940 --> 21:57.580]  Jerry in 77 and my gramps in 95.
[21:57.580 --> 22:01.220]  Then I thought about it, and if I wanted to get realistic and smoke with somebody who
[22:01.220 --> 22:06.740]  is alive, and this was an actual opportunity for myself, my reply was I've smoked with
[22:06.740 --> 22:11.500]  most of my bucket list of stoners, but I'd love to smoke with Joe Rogan before my time
[22:11.500 --> 22:12.500]  is up.
[22:12.500 --> 22:13.500]  I've never smoked with Joe Rogan.
[22:13.500 --> 22:14.780]  I've seen him do comedy.
[22:14.860 --> 22:17.300]  I've been in the same room as him a couple of times.
[22:17.300 --> 22:21.420]  Never consumed cannabis with Joe Rogan, so that's something I would like to do.
[22:21.420 --> 22:25.420]  Joe Rogan is probably my number one option.
[22:25.420 --> 22:29.140]  Snoop Dogg is up on that list, and there are a few other musicians and comedians I'd like
[22:29.140 --> 22:34.340]  to smoke with, but I think Joe Rogan is my number one decision there of a living person
[22:34.340 --> 22:37.100]  I'd like to smoke with.
[22:37.100 --> 22:40.540]  Then let's read some of the Twitter replies now that I've set this up so well.
[22:40.540 --> 22:41.940]  My friend Clint Stewart, what's up Clint?
[22:41.940 --> 22:42.940]  I hope you listen to this.
[22:42.940 --> 22:44.660]  He's at Tall Clint on Twitter.
[22:44.660 --> 22:49.140]  Clint said Trump today to try and figure out what his game plan is.
[22:49.140 --> 22:54.340]  So Clint wants to smoke a joint with the POTUS, with President Trump, and see what the fuck
[22:54.340 --> 22:55.780]  his game plan is.
[22:55.780 --> 22:59.340]  I'm not sure how that's going to go for either one of them.
[22:59.340 --> 23:00.620]  It may be awkward.
[23:00.620 --> 23:01.620]  Clint's a big dude.
[23:01.620 --> 23:05.440]  You might want to have a bunch of Secret Service dudes around.
[23:05.440 --> 23:06.940]  Let's see what else we got.
[23:06.940 --> 23:11.500]  Aldridge said, my pops, whenever, wherever, I never got the chance.
[23:12.500 --> 23:14.860]  Thanks for letting me share that, Aldridge.
[23:14.860 --> 23:20.620]  Then our friend at CouchGlow said, Terrence McKenna in 1990.
[23:20.620 --> 23:23.460]  I really like that reply.
[23:23.460 --> 23:25.020]  Terrence didn't smoke a lot of cannabis.
[23:25.020 --> 23:28.180]  Terrence McKenna was heavily into psychedelics.
[23:28.180 --> 23:33.220]  He was an ethno-pharmacologist, is what I think he called himself, and he did a lot
[23:33.220 --> 23:38.380]  of hallucinogenic drugs, a lot of spiritual drugs, but he wasn't a cannabis consumer.
[23:38.380 --> 23:43.660]  He said that the best way to consume cannabis was to go for long periods of time without
[23:43.660 --> 23:49.100]  consuming cannabis, and then when you do, smoke as much as you can possibly handle,
[23:49.100 --> 23:51.300]  was his theory on cannabis consumption.
[23:51.300 --> 23:53.460]  He said that's the way it worked the best for him.
[23:53.460 --> 23:59.380]  So smoking with Terrence would probably lead to some really crazy conversations.
[23:59.380 --> 24:03.420]  Just to hear some of his stories of going to other countries and consuming some of the
[24:03.420 --> 24:08.340]  drugs that they've offered him there, some of the adventures with his brother Dennis,
[24:08.340 --> 24:13.060]  some of the adventures with Terrence, Dennis, and the other scientists they used to travel
[24:13.060 --> 24:18.740]  with, doing drugs and experiencing other cultures, and doing drugs on small islands with the
[24:18.740 --> 24:19.740]  indigenous people.
[24:19.740 --> 24:21.460]  I'd love to hear those stories with Terrence.
[24:21.460 --> 24:23.660]  So that is a fucking really good reply.
[24:23.660 --> 24:25.060]  Thanks for that one.
[24:25.060 --> 24:28.860]  Then this guy says, he calls himself free market capitalist.
[24:28.860 --> 24:32.140]  It's not spelled the natural way, but it's spelled Twitter way.
[24:32.180 --> 24:35.900]  He says, Ernest Hemingway in Paris in the twenties.
[24:35.900 --> 24:37.700]  That is quite an elegant answer.
[24:37.700 --> 24:42.180]  I want to know more about you because that tells me you're a bright person, that you've
[24:42.180 --> 24:46.860]  got good taste, and that you've got to have good conversational skills for that one.
[24:46.860 --> 24:47.860]  I'm impressed.
[24:47.860 --> 24:50.000]  You guys, thanks for the great replies.
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.580]  It's never too late to send in a reply to a Twitter question or a podcast question.
[24:54.580 --> 24:59.140]  I ask you once again, if you could smoke a joint with any person, living or dead, who
[24:59.140 --> 25:00.420]  would you choose?
[25:00.420 --> 25:05.940]  And if that person you choose has passed away, which era of that life would you reanimate
[25:05.940 --> 25:07.140]  that person from?
[25:07.140 --> 25:10.580]  And I've also got a backup question for this.
[25:10.580 --> 25:16.740]  If you do get to smoke a joint with this one person, what strain would you choose to smoke
[25:16.740 --> 25:17.740]  with your pick?
[25:17.740 --> 25:19.100]  Send me a tweet.
[25:19.100 --> 25:21.460]  It's at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[25:21.460 --> 25:23.900]  I would love to hear your reply.
[25:23.900 --> 25:28.500]  All right, you guys, this podcast is getting long and we haven't really talked much about
[25:28.580 --> 25:30.620]  cannabis news, education, or conversation.
[25:30.620 --> 25:34.100]  We have talked about Twitter stuff and we have talked about a Phish concert.
[25:34.100 --> 25:37.220]  I've got a little bonus nugget here at the end of the show for everybody that has stuck
[25:37.220 --> 25:38.540]  around this long.
[25:38.540 --> 25:42.740]  If you've listened to the show for a while, you know that a while back I did an episode
[25:42.740 --> 25:47.340]  called Email From A Cop, which was followed by Email From A Cop Part 2.
[25:47.340 --> 25:52.580]  I got an email from a law enforcement officer who wanted to give us some cannabis tips and
[25:52.580 --> 25:53.580]  hints.
[25:53.580 --> 25:55.180]  I read his email.
[25:55.180 --> 26:00.300]  People replied with more questions than he replied with answers to those questions.
[26:00.300 --> 26:06.540]  Now, in a recent episode, somebody asked about keeping your cannabis in your glove box.
[26:06.540 --> 26:10.820]  Is law enforcement allowed to search your glove box when you get pulled over?
[26:10.820 --> 26:15.380]  I did not have a solid answer, but I knew my law enforcement friend would be listening
[26:15.380 --> 26:18.220]  and that he would chime in with feedback.
[26:18.220 --> 26:20.100]  So we've got an answer.
[26:20.100 --> 26:21.100]  So here it is.
[26:21.100 --> 26:23.300]  Email From A Cop Part 3, you guys.
[26:23.300 --> 26:26.580]  He said, Hey Rasta Jeff, heard the question about the glove box.
[26:26.580 --> 26:28.180]  You were pretty much spot on.
[26:28.180 --> 26:30.780]  And what I said was, they can get that shit open.
[26:30.780 --> 26:33.000]  If they want to open it, they'll open it.
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.660]  Even if it's not legal, they will use their badge and their bullshit to find a way to
[26:37.660 --> 26:41.460]  get into that glove box and blame it on you, is basically what I said.
[26:41.460 --> 26:43.260]  So he said, you're pretty much spot on.
[26:43.260 --> 26:47.500]  If there is probable cause, there is very little hesitation on the cop's end to break
[26:47.500 --> 26:49.060]  open a glove box.
[26:49.060 --> 26:53.900]  In fact, with probable cause, refusing to open the glove box could be stretched into
[26:53.900 --> 26:56.300]  delaying or obstructing.
[26:56.300 --> 26:58.700]  You were also right about the fake smell.
[26:58.700 --> 27:01.020]  If cops want in, they are getting in.
[27:01.020 --> 27:04.700]  So what he's saying about the fake smell is, I said, if the cops really want in your glove
[27:04.700 --> 27:07.260]  box, they look at each other and they go, I smell marijuana.
[27:07.260 --> 27:08.740]  Now we've got probable cause.
[27:08.740 --> 27:10.420]  So that's the games that the cops play.
[27:10.420 --> 27:13.900]  And our law enforcement friend says that we are accurate with that.
[27:13.900 --> 27:17.820]  So you guys don't keep your cannabis in the glove box and think that you're safe.
[27:17.820 --> 27:21.780]  You don't keep anything illegal in the glove box and think that you're safe from law enforcement.
[27:21.780 --> 27:25.020]  If they think that you've got something and they want in that glove box, they will ask
[27:25.020 --> 27:26.020]  you to open it.
[27:26.020 --> 27:33.020]  If you do not open it, you may be delaying their investigation or obstructing their investigation.
[27:33.020 --> 27:36.140]  Depending on where you are, the wording will be different, but you're going to be charged
[27:36.140 --> 27:37.580]  with basically the same shit.
[27:37.580 --> 27:38.780]  You're not complying.
[27:38.780 --> 27:41.620]  You're making their investigation harder on them.
[27:41.620 --> 27:44.900]  And then if you don't want to do that, and they don't want to mess with you for delaying
[27:44.900 --> 27:47.820]  or obstructing, they just say probable cause.
[27:47.820 --> 27:49.700]  It smells like marijuana in the car.
[27:49.700 --> 27:53.340]  You want to open the glove box and for being a dick, I'm going to get a crowbar and I'm
[27:53.340 --> 27:55.940]  going to pull this fucker apart and destroy your car.
[27:55.940 --> 27:57.700]  So don't keep your stuff in the glove box.
[27:57.700 --> 27:59.420]  Don't put anything illegal in there.
[27:59.420 --> 28:01.800]  You honestly shouldn't have anything illegal in the car.
[28:01.800 --> 28:05.580]  If you've got something, the first rule, let's, let's rewind here.
[28:05.580 --> 28:08.700]  Let's think about rule number one, only break one rule at a time.
[28:08.700 --> 28:13.380]  If you've got something in the car that you're worried about law enforcement finding drive,
[28:13.380 --> 28:18.620]  like you were taking a driving test the entire time you've got something illegal in the car.
[28:18.620 --> 28:21.440]  Drive like you've got something illegal in the car.
[28:21.440 --> 28:23.660]  Don't do dumb shit to get yourself pulled over.
[28:23.660 --> 28:25.760]  Play the music at an acceptable volume.
[28:25.760 --> 28:28.220]  Come to a complete stop at stop signs.
[28:28.220 --> 28:30.100]  Don't drive too fast.
[28:30.100 --> 28:31.300]  Don't cut anybody off.
[28:31.300 --> 28:32.860]  Use your fucking blinkers.
[28:32.860 --> 28:34.460]  Use common sense.
[28:34.460 --> 28:39.480]  White Mike would teach us only break one rule at a time.
[28:39.480 --> 28:40.820]  Always remember that you guys.
[28:40.820 --> 28:45.500]  So if the rule that you have chosen to break is to have something illegal in your vehicle,
[28:45.500 --> 28:48.420]  don't break any other rules so that that thing gets discovered.
[28:48.420 --> 28:52.780]  Now if you insist on having something illegal in the vehicle, and I can't advise that you
[28:52.780 --> 28:55.980]  do that, I have to say, don't put anything illegal in your car.
[28:55.980 --> 29:00.100]  If you do though, don't put it in the glove box because you're going to reach in there
[29:00.100 --> 29:02.540]  to get your license, registration, proof of insurance.
[29:02.540 --> 29:05.540]  You're going to open up the glove box and you go, Oh, registrate.
[29:05.540 --> 29:07.060]  Your license is probably in your wallet.
[29:07.060 --> 29:09.900]  You're going to go on registration, proof of insurance in my bag of weed.
[29:09.980 --> 29:11.860]  Here you go officer and you're going to be fucked.
[29:11.860 --> 29:15.180]  And if you lock it and they went in there, they're going to bust it open and get it out
[29:15.180 --> 29:16.620]  and charge you with obstruction.
[29:16.620 --> 29:17.940]  Now this email goes on.
[29:17.940 --> 29:25.100]  He says the only thing about the use of a dog is it cannot prolong a traffic stop longer
[29:25.100 --> 29:28.420]  than a reasonable time to write a ticket.
[29:28.420 --> 29:34.060]  For example, if you get stopped and the reason is a taillight out and the cop calls a dog
[29:34.060 --> 29:37.660]  over and 45 minutes later, the dog arrives in alerts.
[29:37.660 --> 29:42.460]  Well, then you have been unlawfully D laid.
[29:42.460 --> 29:50.140]  So the cops can only hold you there for a reasonable amount of time to write a ticket.
[29:50.140 --> 29:55.180]  So if you are pulled over for having a taillight out or because you were speeding, that cop
[29:55.180 --> 29:58.780]  can only keep you there long enough to write you that ticket.
[29:58.780 --> 30:00.620]  And then he is supposed to let you go.
[30:00.620 --> 30:04.660]  He can't hold you there forever if it takes a long time for that dog to get there.
[30:04.660 --> 30:07.360]  Now there are a bunch of stupid catches to this.
[30:07.360 --> 30:11.500]  Maybe he's writing your ticket and it's taking a really long time for dispatch to run your
[30:11.500 --> 30:12.500]  ID.
[30:12.500 --> 30:13.500]  That happens all the time.
[30:13.500 --> 30:17.100]  If you ever notice, if you get pulled over and you're late for work and you're speeding,
[30:17.100 --> 30:19.420]  the cop says, I'm just going to run your stuff.
[30:19.420 --> 30:22.140]  It takes for fucking ever to run your stuff.
[30:22.140 --> 30:27.260]  If it's late at night and they're looking for somebody and you get pulled over and they
[30:27.260 --> 30:30.540]  run your stuff, it only takes a couple of minutes because they want to run your shit
[30:30.540 --> 30:33.820]  and get back on the case and find the guy that did the shit late at night.
[30:33.820 --> 30:36.980]  If you don't match that description, if you're not guilty or whatever, they want to run your
[30:36.980 --> 30:37.980]  shit.
[30:37.980 --> 30:38.980]  Sorry to bug you, sir.
[30:38.980 --> 30:41.620]  Get back in your car, get out of my way so I can go find the actual perp I'm looking
[30:41.620 --> 30:42.620]  for.
[30:42.620 --> 30:45.700]  If it's a traffic stop during the day and you say, Oh, I was speeding because I was
[30:45.700 --> 30:46.700]  late.
[30:46.700 --> 30:47.700]  They go, yeah, fuck you, pal.
[30:47.700 --> 30:49.340]  You're going to be late as fuck now.
[30:49.340 --> 30:52.020]  And it takes them all day to run your license.
[30:52.020 --> 30:53.020]  It's all day.
[30:53.020 --> 30:56.140]  You just sit there and you're just later and later for work and they're doing it on purpose.
[30:56.140 --> 31:00.860]  So they'll do that same shit to delay you to get that dog time to get there.
[31:00.860 --> 31:04.100]  Now another thing that could happen, maybe the dog's not far away.
[31:04.100 --> 31:05.460]  Maybe they got him right down the block.
[31:05.460 --> 31:07.220]  Maybe that cop dog is just driving around.
[31:07.220 --> 31:09.820]  Maybe he just came from training class and he's out driving, looking for some shit to
[31:09.820 --> 31:12.220]  do and they're like, Hey, is the canine unit available?
[31:12.220 --> 31:13.860]  They're like, fuck yeah, bill rule right here.
[31:13.860 --> 31:14.860]  Three blocks away.
[31:14.860 --> 31:15.860]  We're on our way.
[31:15.860 --> 31:16.860]  We'll come get you.
[31:16.860 --> 31:18.580]  And that cop's going to come smell your car and that dog's going to alert that you've
[31:18.580 --> 31:21.380]  got something in the glove box and they're going to put you in cuffs and put you in the
[31:21.380 --> 31:24.300]  back of the car and they're not going to let you open the glove box to get your herb out
[31:24.300 --> 31:27.500]  to give it to him because you already had that chance and he done fucked up.
[31:27.500 --> 31:29.140]  They're going to break that shit open.
[31:29.140 --> 31:31.900]  They've got your keys because they're in the ignition of the car.
[31:31.900 --> 31:33.060]  They're not going to use them.
[31:33.060 --> 31:36.620]  They're going to pry that shit open because you lied and wasted their time and now they
[31:36.620 --> 31:38.440]  want to fuck your life up.
[31:38.440 --> 31:40.780]  So they're supposed to play by certain rules, but so are we.
[31:40.780 --> 31:44.700]  And we all know how to bend the rules to make things work for what we need to do.
[31:44.700 --> 31:48.340]  Our law enforcement friend ends his email with the best piece of advice.
[31:48.340 --> 31:51.180]  He says, best rule of thumb for prohibition land.
[31:51.180 --> 31:53.340]  Don't be writing dirty.
[31:53.340 --> 31:56.200]  So the best rule of thumb is don't be writing dirty.
[31:56.200 --> 32:01.220]  And if you insist on writing dirty, only break one rule at a time.
[32:01.220 --> 32:06.060]  He ends the email by saying, peace and love all be safe out there.
[32:06.060 --> 32:09.660]  And then he sends me a little personal note that I'm not going to include here, but dude,
[32:09.660 --> 32:11.260]  that's a great ending to that email.
[32:11.260 --> 32:12.260]  I appreciate that.
[32:12.260 --> 32:13.740]  Hey man, thanks for the great email.
[32:13.740 --> 32:15.100]  I want to add to this.
[32:15.100 --> 32:18.820]  You guys obviously not all law enforcement are terrible people.
[32:18.820 --> 32:24.540]  This guy is law enforcement and he's giving us advice on how to not get in trouble.
[32:24.540 --> 32:27.660]  So I think the first thing you should do if you get pulled over is try to play the nice
[32:27.660 --> 32:29.100]  guy role with the cop.
[32:29.100 --> 32:33.440]  Try to be respectful, try to be polite, and maybe you will do the same thing.
[32:33.440 --> 32:38.500]  If not, then you can adjust your conversation as needed, but start the conversation off
[32:38.500 --> 32:39.680]  polite and friendly.
[32:39.680 --> 32:43.740]  Take off your sunglasses, look them in the face, hand them your license, registration,
[32:43.740 --> 32:46.880]  proof of insurance, be an adult about it.
[32:46.880 --> 32:50.440]  If the first thing I said to you when we met was, what the fuck do you want?
[32:50.440 --> 32:53.500]  We're not going to have a good conversation no matter what I had in mind.
[32:53.500 --> 32:57.800]  If the first thing I say to you when we meet is, good afternoon sir, how can I help you?
[32:57.800 --> 32:59.680]  Our conversation may go a little bit better.
[32:59.680 --> 33:02.240]  You get to determine a lot of the interaction.
[33:02.240 --> 33:04.880]  So try to be polite, try to be friendly.
[33:04.880 --> 33:10.360]  The only things you really need to be saying to law enforcement are, yes sir, and no sir.
[33:10.360 --> 33:13.320]  Other than that, you're just digging yourself a hole.
[33:13.320 --> 33:14.320]  I'm a big dude.
[33:14.320 --> 33:16.760]  I'm six foot five and nearly 200 pounds.
[33:16.760 --> 33:19.440]  I'm getting skinny lately, but I'm still a big dude.
[33:19.440 --> 33:21.880]  I can be intimidating to law enforcement.
[33:21.880 --> 33:26.640]  If you're a big dude, keep that type of stuff in mind, especially if it's a little cop.
[33:26.640 --> 33:30.440]  Big guys make little cops nervous and they've got something to prove, so they get shaky
[33:30.440 --> 33:34.160]  around us and they got to keep an eye on you and they get squirrely.
[33:34.160 --> 33:37.520]  So keep that kind of stuff in mind when you're dealing with law enforcement, but keep in
[33:37.520 --> 33:42.360]  mind you get to dictate a lot of the way the interaction goes.
[33:42.360 --> 33:47.400]  There are some cops out there that are going to fuck your day up no matter how you act,
[33:47.400 --> 33:49.880]  but not all of them want to ruin your day or life.
[33:49.880 --> 33:53.440]  We've obviously got one friend here who's helping us out.
[33:53.440 --> 33:57.720]  So the first thing to keep in mind is don't ride dirty if at all possible.
[33:57.720 --> 34:02.440]  The backup plan, if you're going to ride dirty, only break one rule at a time and you've chosen
[34:02.440 --> 34:03.440]  to ride dirty.
[34:03.440 --> 34:04.720]  That's the rule we're going to break today.
[34:04.720 --> 34:08.360]  Now we got to do the speed limit, got to come to a complete stop at every stop.
[34:08.360 --> 34:10.320]  We got to use the turn signals.
[34:10.320 --> 34:14.240]  Drive like your mama's in the car and she's going to smack the shit out of you if you get crazy.
[34:14.240 --> 34:19.920]  Now if you do get pulled over, be respectful and polite to law enforcement.
[34:19.920 --> 34:21.640]  Don't make any jittery moves.
[34:21.640 --> 34:23.040]  Don't reach for shit.
[34:23.040 --> 34:26.840]  Try to have your license, registration and proof of insurance ready for law enforcement
[34:26.840 --> 34:28.000]  when they approach the vehicle.
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.480]  Have the windows down, have your hands visible, have your paperwork in your hands.
[34:32.480 --> 34:35.680]  When he says license, registration, proof of insurance, be able to hand it to him with
[34:35.680 --> 34:36.680]  a smile.
[34:36.680 --> 34:39.120]  If you're wearing sunglasses, take them off and look him in the eye.
[34:39.120 --> 34:41.120]  Be like, look, I ain't got shit to hide.
[34:41.120 --> 34:42.120]  Here's my paperwork.
[34:42.120 --> 34:43.120]  Here's my face.
[34:43.120 --> 34:44.560]  Here's who I am.
[34:44.560 --> 34:45.720]  Comply with them.
[34:45.720 --> 34:48.720]  Don't give him any reason to tase, mace or shoot your ass.
[34:48.720 --> 34:50.320]  You don't need any of that.
[34:50.320 --> 34:55.320]  Say yes sir and no sir and don't consent to anything you're not comfortable with.
[34:55.320 --> 35:00.020]  Try to remember that every question they ask you is a trap and that two or three questions
[35:00.020 --> 35:03.800]  after that question is going to be the same question worded differently to try to get
[35:03.800 --> 35:05.400]  you to fuck up.
[35:05.400 --> 35:06.400]  So just don't talk.
[35:06.400 --> 35:09.600]  Yes sir and no sir is plenty of information for law enforcement.
[35:09.600 --> 35:10.640]  They don't need to know much else.
[35:10.640 --> 35:12.860]  You don't have to tell them anything else.
[35:12.860 --> 35:16.400]  Only tell them what you're comfortable with and if you decide at any time you've said
[35:16.400 --> 35:18.560]  enough, you can stop talking.
[35:18.560 --> 35:21.260]  You have the right to remain silent.
[35:21.260 --> 35:22.260]  You know why?
[35:22.260 --> 35:27.560]  Because anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
[35:27.560 --> 35:28.560]  So keep your mouth shut.
[35:28.560 --> 35:32.160]  Yes sir and no sir is enough information.
[35:32.160 --> 35:34.720]  Because I feel like I need to make a disclaimer that I am not a lawyer.
[35:34.720 --> 35:36.800]  I've never been to law school.
[35:36.800 --> 35:42.520]  If you are looking for real legal advice in a situation like this, I highly recommend
[35:42.520 --> 35:46.440]  you speak with a qualified attorney.
[35:46.440 --> 35:52.200]  Please don't try to go to court with any Rasta Jeff legal advice that could go horribly wrong
[35:52.200 --> 35:53.200]  for you.
[35:53.200 --> 35:56.600]  All right, you guys, I want to give a huge shout out to our law enforcement friend.
[35:56.600 --> 35:58.800]  Dude, thanks again for the email.
[35:58.800 --> 36:00.960]  If I've got more questions, I will reach out.
[36:00.960 --> 36:04.800]  If you've got more guidance you'd like to share, please send me another email.

[37:30.880 --> 37:33.800]  I'll be back Monday with episode 350.
[37:33.800 --> 37:36.360]  I can't believe I've done 350 episodes.
[37:36.360 --> 37:37.800]  Oh my God, it just set in.
[37:37.800 --> 37:41.120]  I just felt the pride and anxiety and whatever else that is.
[37:41.120 --> 37:42.120]  I'm feeling it.
