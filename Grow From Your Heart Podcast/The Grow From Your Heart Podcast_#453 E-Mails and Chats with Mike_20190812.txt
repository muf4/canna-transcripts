[00:00.000 --> 00:02.040]  Welcome back podcast world.
[00:02.040 --> 00:05.880]  It is time for episode 453 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.040 --> 00:09.160]  Sitting across the table from me is White Mike. Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:09.320 --> 00:10.880]  Thanks man. What's up everybody.
[00:11.240 --> 00:14.240]  What's up everybody. Hope everybody's having a wonderful evening, daytime,
[00:14.240 --> 00:17.640]  nighttime, afternoon, whatever time it is, wherever the fuck you are.
[00:17.640 --> 00:20.040]  Hope you're having a great one. Hope you're smoking something delicious.
[00:20.040 --> 00:21.520]  Hope you're hanging out with somebody beautiful.
[00:21.720 --> 00:24.480]  Hope you got a nice buzz on if you're in your cubicle and you can't smoke,
[00:24.480 --> 00:26.560]  if you're at work and you can't smoke, don't worry.
[00:26.680 --> 00:29.920]  Mike and I have got you covered. We are plenty medicated here today.
[00:29.960 --> 00:33.320]  Did a dab for you, bro. Did a dab for you, bro.
[00:33.320 --> 00:36.440]  As always this podcast is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:36.440 --> 00:39.640]  If you need new regular feminized or auto flower seeds,
[00:39.640 --> 00:42.160]  auto was the one I almost forgot. They even got auto flowers, bro.
[00:42.560 --> 00:44.040]  If you need new seeds in your garden,
[00:44.200 --> 00:49.200]  I highly recommend seeds here now and you can find them at seedsherenow.com.
[00:52.880 --> 00:56.280]  We do like to start the podcast off by talking about what we are smoking,
[00:56.520 --> 00:59.880]  Mike and I said we took a dab for you just in case you're curious.
[00:59.880 --> 01:04.880]  That dab was banana Rama Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:05.240 --> 01:09.240]  The potency label says 70.1% THC,
[01:09.400 --> 01:11.640]  which is not a high number, but I got lit from smoking it.
[01:11.800 --> 01:16.800]  It says total cannabinoids, 81% total cannabinoids.
[01:16.840 --> 01:21.480]  So there's gotta be some CBD or some THC V or some something different in there.
[01:21.800 --> 01:24.520]  Something, something. Yeah, I lost the thread.
[01:24.760 --> 01:28.520]  Mike lost his train of thought. It's working. That's what's up. Uh,
[01:28.560 --> 01:32.160]  banana Rama. It's got a really interesting aroma. It does have the banana.
[01:32.480 --> 01:35.920]  It's got the more you're you're jumping right on it. It's got a,
[01:35.920 --> 01:38.960]  I said it tastes like Jello shots and I haven't had a Jello shot in a hundred
[01:38.960 --> 01:43.640]  years, but it's got that, uh, the green Jello, not the band, but the snack.
[01:43.880 --> 01:47.840]  It's got the green Jello sort of a flavor to it. Aroma a little bit.
[01:48.120 --> 01:50.440]  I think so. That lemon lime Jello sort of a thing.
[01:50.680 --> 01:55.680]  Big shout out to our friends at apothecary farms for the banana Rama Ambrosia.
[01:56.600 --> 01:57.600]  All right. Podcast world.
[01:57.600 --> 02:02.520]  I recently discovered a new website that provides a lot of information for me.
[02:02.520 --> 02:03.760]  I'm not going to tell you the name of the website.
[02:03.760 --> 02:06.280]  Mike looked at me as if I may do my advertising voice.
[02:06.280 --> 02:09.120]  We were joking about it earlier. Not going to happen. Not going to do it.
[02:09.440 --> 02:13.440]  I did find a website where I can find a lot of podcast reviews,
[02:13.480 --> 02:17.280]  a lot of statistics. Uh, they want me to give them money for some more stuff,
[02:17.640 --> 02:20.400]  but the free stuff is very useful. There are a lot of useful stats on there.
[02:20.400 --> 02:25.280]  I can see my rankings on stitcher and iTunes. I can see my favorite part.
[02:25.280 --> 02:28.720]  What I'm getting at is all of the iTunes customer reviews,
[02:28.720 --> 02:32.240]  all of the stitcher reviews, they are all compiled into one place.
[02:32.480 --> 02:36.080]  One hopeful place. I did not realize, I think I knew it,
[02:36.080 --> 02:37.640]  but I don't think I ever thought about it.
[02:38.160 --> 02:42.680]  That iTunes is broken down by country and there are folks in other countries
[02:42.680 --> 02:44.760]  that have been leaving reviews on the podcast,
[02:44.760 --> 02:47.320]  which we are not able to discover through.
[02:47.360 --> 02:50.240]  We don't see through the platform we access. Exactly.
[02:50.240 --> 02:52.360]  Because they've got a different library and a different,
[02:52.360 --> 02:54.960]  I don't just a different algorithm and they're probably different things.
[02:55.400 --> 02:57.040]  Yeah. Different, different stuff.
[02:57.320 --> 02:59.280]  I don't need to worry about what all the technical stuff is.
[02:59.280 --> 03:02.920]  But my point is there are other reviews which we have been missing.
[03:04.640 --> 03:06.080]  When you do that, it's really creepy by the way.
[03:07.640 --> 03:10.360]  Your mic is so low that it comes weird. Yeah, that is creepy.
[03:12.080 --> 03:16.000]  So there are more reviews and I think that we need to take a minute and read
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.880]  some of the reviews from some of our friends from other places.
[03:19.960 --> 03:22.960]  I think we should. It may be discriminatory if we didn't do so.
[03:24.040 --> 03:26.320]  I'm going to leave out, speaking of discriminatory,
[03:26.320 --> 03:30.480]  I'm going to leave out the US iTunes customer reviews because they're easily
[03:30.480 --> 03:32.880]  accessible on the iTunes, which I normally find.
[03:33.440 --> 03:37.360]  We're going to focus on our foreign friends for these next couple of reviews.
[03:37.360 --> 03:39.920]  International. And then after we do a couple of reviews,
[03:39.920 --> 03:44.280]  we are going to jump into some listener emails. A couple of them.
[03:44.560 --> 03:46.840]  All right, let's jump right into it. All right.
[03:46.880 --> 03:51.760]  This review was left on May 9th and it goes a lot like
[03:51.800 --> 03:54.840]  this. They gave us a five star rating. It says it is the best.
[03:54.840 --> 03:59.800]  I should mention that this one was left by Big Baz on Apple Podcasts
[03:59.880 --> 04:03.080]  from Great Britain. So the comment goes,
[04:03.280 --> 04:05.680]  I would highly recommend listening to this podcast,
[04:05.720 --> 04:09.160]  even if you are just remotely interested about cannabis.
[04:09.600 --> 04:13.920]  It is the best source of comication. And then he said comedy and education.
[04:14.120 --> 04:17.720]  This is my review. I can write like that if I want. And I appreciate that.
[04:17.720 --> 04:21.080]  I like your creative writing. He goes on to say for cannabis,
[04:21.240 --> 04:24.440]  I could easily sit and listen to Rasta Jeff and the, and of course,
[04:24.440 --> 04:27.280]  White Mike for hours, which I have done.
[04:27.640 --> 04:30.040]  They should be proud of what they've achieved. You hear that, Mike?
[04:30.040 --> 04:31.760]  We should be a proud of what we have achieved.
[04:32.080 --> 04:35.160]  And if this listener could only help with the progression of cannabis,
[04:35.160 --> 04:39.360]  as much as we have, he would be a happy man. Hey, that's cool, man. Thank you.
[04:39.360 --> 04:41.520]  I appreciate hearing that. Then it says,
[04:41.520 --> 04:45.160]  I think you need to take a tour to the UK and spread your love around here.
[04:45.520 --> 04:49.440]  Thank for all of your help from Just Baz. What up Just Baz.
[04:49.440 --> 04:52.440]  Thanks for all the love and support. Uh, they help us out on Patreon also.
[04:52.440 --> 04:56.720]  I appreciate that. So that is a great review from our friends in Great Britain.
[04:56.880 --> 04:59.960]  Appreciate it. Yeah. So far so good, dude. All right.
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.880]  This next one I believe comes from our friends in Canada.
[05:02.880 --> 05:06.240]  Big shout out to our friends up North. They gave us five out of five.
[05:06.440 --> 05:11.000]  This one is from Presley, Presley Boo from Apple Podcasts in Canada.
[05:11.280 --> 05:13.480]  This was left on August 6th. It says,
[05:13.720 --> 05:18.720]  one of my favorite podcasts top tier sound quality and information.
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.360]  That is a great review. I could stop there. Uh,
[05:21.360 --> 05:25.400]  they like the top tier sound quality and they like the information.
[05:25.640 --> 05:28.320]  They go on to say they've been listening to all the grow lessons and they're
[05:28.340 --> 05:33.040]  extremely helpful. So I appreciate that. They wrap it up with Irie gang,
[05:33.040 --> 05:37.240]  gang, gang, gang, gang, buzz, buzz. Thanks for the great review.
[05:37.440 --> 05:38.240]  I appreciate it.
[05:38.240 --> 05:41.560]  The people appreciate the top tier sound quality because I put a little effort
[05:41.560 --> 05:45.760]  into that. Uh, I was an audio kind of a guy before I really got into the podcast
[05:45.760 --> 05:49.320]  thing. So I'm glad people notice. I'm glad they liked the top tier information.
[05:49.680 --> 05:51.720]  And those grow lessons took a lot of work.
[05:51.720 --> 05:55.520]  So I'm glad they found those helpful and big shout out for the gang gang. Uh,
[05:56.040 --> 05:58.720]  it's good to know my friends are listening to the same podcast that I'm
[05:58.720 --> 06:02.400]  listening to. All right. This next review comes from our friends up North,
[06:02.400 --> 06:06.560]  big shout out to our friends in Canada. This one says Rasta, Jeff, my dude,
[06:06.560 --> 06:08.760]  they gave us five stars and it says Rasta.
[06:08.760 --> 06:13.200]  Jeff is the most effective cannabis cultivation
[06:13.280 --> 06:17.440]  educator around these parts. That's a huge compliment, dude.
[06:17.880 --> 06:20.440]  The most effective, uh, that means a lot.
[06:20.460 --> 06:24.120]  Like that means the effort we're putting in is doing the most work.
[06:24.160 --> 06:28.520]  Is that a comment on you or a comment on those parts around those? Well,
[06:28.600 --> 06:31.800]  there you go. Maybe, maybe I'm the only, if I'm the only one.
[06:31.800 --> 06:35.320]  Well, Jesse, you go to just go out of control folks every now and then we've got
[06:35.320 --> 06:36.720]  to give it a little poke. That's the truth.
[06:36.720 --> 06:40.080]  Maybe I'm the only one around those parts, which still damn means I'm the best.
[06:40.080 --> 06:43.360]  Damn it. Then they said the Willie Nelson Snoop dog over here.
[06:43.360 --> 06:45.720]  So I guess that's another huge compliment. Uh,
[06:45.720 --> 06:49.680]  I started this podcast on a two to three hour commute to a job.
[06:49.680 --> 06:53.840]  I hated the podcast inspired me to become a novice homegrower.
[06:53.840 --> 06:58.960]  So we got them growing. That's the goal. Then it says I have perfected my craft.
[06:59.080 --> 07:03.240]  I've entered the Canadian cannabis industry and worked my way from the trimmer
[07:03.280 --> 07:07.800]  room into the room to a grow lead manager.
[07:07.840 --> 07:11.400]  How many of those coworkers did you introduce to the podcast? Yeah.
[07:11.480 --> 07:13.680]  Well congrats bro. No, I'm proud of you for,
[07:14.120 --> 07:17.520]  went from listening to the show, being inspired thinking, Hey,
[07:17.520 --> 07:21.920]  I want to grow a little bit and then became a home grower. Perfected the craft.
[07:22.120 --> 07:24.960]  Got good. The craft got good enough. Yeah. Right.
[07:24.960 --> 07:27.720]  Get out of the rat race and into something we'd like to do.
[07:27.920 --> 07:30.520]  Entered the industry about away from the trim room.
[07:30.520 --> 07:34.000]  I always talk about the first step is go trim. You got to trim the trim room.
[07:34.160 --> 07:38.400]  Yep. Went from the trim room. Now they are lead grow lead manager.
[07:38.400 --> 07:41.720]  And then they say much respect my dude. And then it says, when these,
[07:41.760 --> 07:44.560]  I don't know if there's more to this review that this application cut off,
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.320]  but uh, dude, that is a great review. Even without the, when these,
[07:48.320 --> 07:51.520]  if that's how it ends, then when these bro, uh, when these,
[07:52.400 --> 07:54.840]  much respect my dude. So big respect back at you.
[07:54.840 --> 07:58.960]  That's from our friend loud music, two zero one four at Apple podcasts in Canada.
[07:59.160 --> 08:01.920]  So big shout out to our friends from Canada, our big friends up North.
[08:02.160 --> 08:04.120]  I hope you guys are having a great grow season up there.
[08:04.120 --> 08:08.720]  Hope everything's going well for you. Hope you're staying. I re all right,
[08:08.720 --> 08:11.560]  Mike, I'm going to scroll down. We've got a couple of more reviews.
[08:11.840 --> 08:15.200]  This website keeps refreshing itself because there's an ad.
[08:15.200 --> 08:18.600]  So it's hard for me to keep track of my place on this page,
[08:19.120 --> 08:22.520]  but we're going to get through it together. Technology shall not defeat me.
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.880]  You look like you doubt me, bro. No, you just looked at me like, I don't know.
[08:27.920 --> 08:28.720]  I might get you dude.
[08:28.720 --> 08:31.680]  It just also looks like you're playing tic-tac-toe with yourself on your list.
[08:32.040 --> 08:34.600]  I'm just making sure to cross out the ones we do so that I don't read them all
[08:34.600 --> 08:37.200]  over again because nobody wants to hear these twice. In fact,
[08:37.200 --> 08:41.280]  we'll get to another review in a minute. Uh, this one comes from our friend. Uh,
[08:41.320 --> 08:44.360]  he says Wales, UK and they gave us five stars.
[08:44.360 --> 08:48.640]  They are called Zootopian and they're listening on Apple podcasts from great
[08:48.640 --> 08:51.680]  Britain. Apparently they're from Wales, UK. They say,
[08:51.720 --> 08:56.200]  let's hear about outdoor gorilla grow auto flower tips.
[08:56.960 --> 09:00.200]  Um, that's not my wheelhouse. I would fail at that.
[09:00.520 --> 09:05.040]  I did a decent outdoor grow lesson. It was a little bit, uh,
[09:05.040 --> 09:06.920]  but auto flower is not my wheelhouse.
[09:06.920 --> 09:09.520]  I don't know much about auto flowers and anything I did,
[09:09.520 --> 09:10.920]  I would have to just fake it for you.
[09:10.920 --> 09:14.040]  So that wouldn't be a quality podcast in my opinion.
[09:14.120 --> 09:16.520]  We could do a little, uh,
[09:16.560 --> 09:20.120]  a show on like a really growing general tips or, uh,
[09:21.120 --> 09:23.960]  how shit used to be back here in the struggle blood days.
[09:24.960 --> 09:26.800]  Struggle. But I haven't heard that word in a minute.
[09:26.840 --> 09:29.400]  When I first heard of auto flowers, that was the first,
[09:29.400 --> 09:31.280]  the first place my brain went was like,
[09:31.280 --> 09:34.800]  those would be perfect for a struggle, but crowd. Yeah. Um,
[09:34.880 --> 09:38.120]  struggle bud was a term for, uh, planting seeds.
[09:38.120 --> 09:43.000]  It kind of in the wilderness in a location that was likely to
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.160]  produce some sort of growth without any intervention from you,
[09:47.640 --> 09:49.440]  from the, uh, the state.
[09:49.560 --> 09:54.080]  Like when you put the seed in the ground until you come back six months later
[09:54.080 --> 09:56.440]  and rip it out of the ground and run away real quick in the dark,
[09:57.920 --> 09:59.760]  that was struggle, but growing shit.
[09:59.760 --> 10:02.800]  Half of the people I knew with home grows outside had some struggle,
[10:02.800 --> 10:06.600]  but going on and fucking looked like, right. Yeah. Uh, where were we, Mike?
[10:06.600 --> 10:08.640]  Did we start reading this review yet? No, no,
[10:08.640 --> 10:12.160]  knocked out the auto flower review. And now we're on to,
[10:12.440 --> 10:16.520]  you saw me cross that one off the list and go for the next one here. All right.
[10:16.520 --> 10:18.920]  This one is going to be the last one for this episode.
[10:18.920 --> 10:21.040]  Then Mike and I are going to press pause and take a dab.
[10:21.280 --> 10:24.800]  And then we're going to read a couple of emails. This one is a good one.
[10:24.800 --> 10:28.640]  They say 50 50, they call themselves long time listener.
[10:28.840 --> 10:31.800]  They're listening on Apple podcasts from Canada. Once again,
[10:31.800 --> 10:33.320]  big shout out to all of our friends up North.
[10:33.320 --> 10:37.080]  It looks like we have a nice Canadian listenership that makes me happy. Yeah.
[10:37.080 --> 10:40.480]  I enjoy it. I appreciate it. They've got a nice Canadian grow industry up there,
[10:40.720 --> 10:44.040]  a nice cannabis industry. So big shout out to all of our friends. Oh man,
[10:44.400 --> 10:47.400]  I'm going to keep moving forward. The review goes like this.
[10:48.200 --> 10:52.440]  Please stop wasting episodes by reading iTunes reviews.
[10:52.720 --> 10:55.800]  If I wanted to hear reviews, I'd read them aloud to myself.
[10:56.480 --> 10:59.280]  Do more episodes with your strain info, answering emails,
[10:59.320 --> 11:03.800]  grow tips and white Mike with other potential guests. I love the show.
[11:03.800 --> 11:05.760]  I look forward to each and every episode,
[11:06.040 --> 11:10.480]  but the ones when you read reviews feel like a waste of my time and yours.
[11:10.800 --> 11:14.360]  I appreciate the fact that you read the reviews and please take this as a
[11:14.360 --> 11:19.320]  constructive critique and not a dig five out of five stars for most
[11:19.320 --> 11:21.560]  episodes, zero out of five for the ones.
[11:21.800 --> 11:26.800]  When you use most of the episode up by reading reviews, keep up the work.
[11:28.160 --> 11:30.640]  I appreciate the review. I appreciate the feedback.
[11:32.760 --> 11:35.200]  My voice did a weird thing there. I kind of would like to edit that.
[11:35.200 --> 11:36.040]  Going to keep moving.
[11:37.400 --> 11:42.400]  What really helps a podcast to get exposure is when somebody leaves a review that
[11:43.160 --> 11:47.200]  helps us get noticed on the front page of iTunes that makes you more popular in
[11:47.200 --> 11:50.240]  their algorithm. So I request the algorithm. That's the truth.
[11:50.240 --> 11:53.360]  I request reviews. I'm asking people to do that as a favor,
[11:53.840 --> 11:57.480]  as a return to that favor. I read their reviews on the podcast.
[11:57.800 --> 12:01.360]  I know I'm not, maybe not your favorite grow person.
[12:01.360 --> 12:03.920]  Maybe I'm not any sort of important person to you.
[12:04.200 --> 12:07.680]  I know that every time Joey Diaz says my name on the podcast,
[12:07.880 --> 12:11.080]  I know that every time the dude grows, Cruz says my name on the podcast.
[12:11.280 --> 12:14.920]  I still feel a little smile inside. I get a little goofy in my heart.
[12:14.920 --> 12:17.560]  I'm like, ah, they're talking about me on my favorite podcast right now.
[12:17.880 --> 12:21.320]  So when I read people's reviews and I'm reading their shit,
[12:21.360 --> 12:24.120]  they feel like they're connected. I've done them a favor.
[12:24.120 --> 12:26.480]  They've done me a favor. It's a communal effort.
[12:26.600 --> 12:27.880]  So that's why I read the reviews.
[12:27.880 --> 12:31.160]  I say I will read your review on a future episode.
[12:31.160 --> 12:33.000]  And so people leave a review, they want to hear it.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.840]  They want to hear me say it. I think it's a great thing to do.
[12:35.840 --> 12:38.600]  It's an exchange that we both get something out of it.
[12:38.600 --> 12:41.160]  So I appreciate that you find it to be a waste of time.
[12:42.320 --> 12:45.200]  There's a little skip button on your iPad, on your iPhone.
[12:45.200 --> 12:48.400]  It's 15 or 30 seconds forward. Just mash on that a couple of times.
[12:48.400 --> 12:51.000]  You'll probably get through them. We do make some,
[12:52.800 --> 12:55.000]  this we're we're brought to you by Onyx, not really.
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.560]  Manscaped.com don't cut. Anyway, don't cut your dick off.
[13:00.560 --> 13:04.440]  Fuck. Oh, but yeah, just use that 15 second skip forward button.
[13:04.440 --> 13:05.880]  You'll get right through the reviews. You'll be all right.
[13:06.040 --> 13:07.840]  I still want you to listen. I still want to be your friend.
[13:07.840 --> 13:11.040]  I do appreciate your constructive criticism. I don't take it as a dig.
[13:11.520 --> 13:14.720]  You're not going to hurt my feelings. Somebody has to not like,
[13:14.760 --> 13:17.440]  my voice keeps doing weird shit. I'd like to edit, but we're not going to do it.
[13:18.720 --> 13:21.880]  Somebody has to not like you. You're not going to make everybody happy.
[13:21.880 --> 13:25.200]  So, and he said 50 50, he likes the grow episode. So he'll be cool.
[13:25.400 --> 13:27.480]  He probably has already checked out of this and doesn't know.
[13:27.480 --> 13:30.920]  We even read his review. That's funny. If you got this far, send me an update,
[13:30.960 --> 13:34.720]  send me an email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com and be like, I listened, bro.
[13:34.760 --> 13:36.600]  I just want to know if you made it through this. All right.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.280]  I think that is a good spot to stop with the listener reviews.
[13:40.280 --> 13:42.200]  I want to thank everybody for the listener reviews.
[13:42.360 --> 13:45.520]  We really, really appreciate every single review.
[13:45.520 --> 13:50.200]  Even the ones that are negative or focused on something that, that they'd, uh,
[13:50.440 --> 13:51.960]  the reviewer would like us to do different.
[13:51.960 --> 13:54.400]  Every review is helpful and appreciated. Thank you.
[13:55.080 --> 13:59.440]  I may take some of the constructive criticism and I may use it. Um,
[13:59.480 --> 14:02.960]  I'm pretty set at the way that this show goes. I'm comfortable. I,
[14:03.560 --> 14:07.440]  look how many notes we've got. I feel like four notes here for this whole show.
[14:07.720 --> 14:10.120]  It's all I need. We can just turn on a mic and we could start talking.
[14:10.440 --> 14:11.760]  I'm not going to change a lot,
[14:11.760 --> 14:14.960]  but if something really pisses somebody off or something, we would consider it.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.520]  And I'm, I will listen to opinions, but this is the way the show is going to go,
[14:18.520 --> 14:19.640]  bro. We're good at this by now.
[14:20.640 --> 14:22.120]  Yeah. We've got a nice little rhythm down.
[14:22.160 --> 14:25.360]  I think we're both real comfortable with it and enjoy doing it.
[14:25.400 --> 14:29.840]  And I think we've found a fan base that enjoys listening to us do it so far.
[14:30.200 --> 14:34.200]  Like, and if you, you don't agree with that, please hit me up on Twitter.
[14:34.200 --> 14:38.320]  It's at new 15 or public for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[14:38.480 --> 14:42.280]  Hit up Mike. I was going to say, when you're in a room and like one person says,
[14:42.280 --> 14:45.920]  Hey, you're an asshole. That one person may have had a bad experience with you.
[14:45.960 --> 14:49.560]  Two people go, you're an asshole. That could be that other person's friend.
[14:50.040 --> 14:52.200]  But if three or four people start going, you're an asshole,
[14:52.440 --> 14:54.200]  you're probably the asshole so far.
[14:54.760 --> 14:57.560]  Like one out of every 50 reviews say we suck.
[14:57.920 --> 15:01.240]  So we're doing okay. In my opinion, we're not an asshole yet.
[15:01.760 --> 15:03.280]  You're not succeeding unless somebody is hating.
[15:03.480 --> 15:07.320]  That's right. Uh, Michael Franti said, uh, if I don't have any enemies,
[15:07.320 --> 15:10.960]  I'm not doing my job. Life might throw me a curve,
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.280]  but I'll never be throwing a lob. Shout out to Mike Franti. All right. Uh,
[15:15.320 --> 15:19.160]  I said, we're going to take a dab and then we're going to read some emails.
[15:19.360 --> 15:22.960]  So I'm not going to do that Pavlov shit and make you drool over there.
[15:23.160 --> 15:26.520]  Let's press pause for a moment and let's take a dab because they don't want to
[15:26.520 --> 15:29.040]  listen to you choke while we dab. So we're going to press pause.
[15:29.040 --> 15:30.960]  We're going to take a couple of quick dabs. I need a drink.
[15:30.960 --> 15:32.560]  Obviously my voice sounds like shit.
[15:32.840 --> 15:35.200]  We'll be back in just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing.
[15:35.400 --> 15:39.200]  We'll be back right now. Watch. Here we go. All right. We are back.
[15:39.200 --> 15:42.800]  We are well medicated. We are well hydrated. I should speak for myself.
[15:43.200 --> 15:46.080]  Medicated. At least we're working on the second one. Yeah. Yeah. We're,
[15:46.080 --> 15:48.560]  we're doing well over here. Uh, we took some dabs,
[15:48.880 --> 15:51.040]  we smoked some GG foreign Ambrosia.
[15:51.280 --> 15:55.640]  The label says 59 point something percent THC.
[15:55.640 --> 16:00.040]  It's smeared cause I got concentrates on it. Uh, 66.4% total cannabinoids.
[16:00.040 --> 16:04.000]  I feel like I got stoned her than 66%. Yeah, me too.
[16:04.120 --> 16:07.600]  A stoner a word. Cause I just said it like a fucking is now. All right.
[16:07.600 --> 16:09.640]  Podcast world. Before we took a little dab break,
[16:09.640 --> 16:13.760]  we said that we were going to read some emails. Let's read some emails.
[16:13.760 --> 16:16.720]  If you'd like to send me a grow question or something like that,
[16:16.760 --> 16:19.480]  my email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[16:19.480 --> 16:22.480]  You know that I'd like to hear from you. Here is a great email.
[16:22.640 --> 16:25.480]  It goes like this. What up Rasta Jeff? What's up, bro? How you doing?
[16:25.880 --> 16:29.360]  I says good day from down under. Hey, thanks for the good email mate.
[16:29.680 --> 16:31.880]  Then he goes on to say, I'll try to keep it short and sweet.
[16:32.560 --> 16:35.440]  Then he said, that's what she said. Is that what she said?
[16:35.480 --> 16:38.360]  But uh, that's not what she said. I don't think that's what she said, bro.
[16:38.760 --> 16:39.600]  He goes on to say,
[16:39.640 --> 16:43.560]  I came across your podcast about a month or so ago by the way of episode one 38
[16:43.600 --> 16:45.000]  breeding and harvesting seeds.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.720]  I was hooked after hearing how informative and in depth you were in explaining
[16:48.720 --> 16:50.640]  genetics and feminization.
[16:51.560 --> 16:54.080]  Freebies get them hooked. Yeah. Awesome, man. Thank you for listening. Yeah.
[16:54.760 --> 16:57.520]  I'm glad you're listening to the breeding episodes. Uh,
[16:57.560 --> 17:00.120]  then he says I started listening to all of your grow lessons,
[17:00.120 --> 17:03.520]  which have really brought together everything else that I have read through my
[17:03.520 --> 17:07.240]  research about growing and made it simple and easy to understand.
[17:07.800 --> 17:09.880]  That means a lot to me because that is kind of my goal.
[17:09.880 --> 17:13.400]  I want it simple for everybody to understand.
[17:13.960 --> 17:17.320]  People learn with different brain types. People learn by looking, by hearing,
[17:17.320 --> 17:19.520]  by doing. So people are just hands on learners.
[17:19.880 --> 17:22.560]  I try to make it easy for everybody. Even those hands on people.
[17:22.880 --> 17:25.040]  I'm thinking about it. Like Mike sees me right now.
[17:25.040 --> 17:28.360]  I'm like looking telepathically up into the sky and I'm putting my hands in
[17:28.360 --> 17:31.280]  shapes so that I can do those things while I'm thinking about it.
[17:31.280 --> 17:33.960]  So I can explain it to you as thoroughly as possible.
[17:34.240 --> 17:36.960]  So I'm glad that somebody is learning. I'm glad you're appreciating that.
[17:37.720 --> 17:41.720]  This has been a great message. There is still more. He goes on to say,
[17:41.920 --> 17:44.520]  I have some bubble gum, some AK 47,
[17:44.720 --> 17:49.440]  some purple Hayes and white widow seeds and was wondering what your opinions are
[17:49.440 --> 17:53.880]  on these varieties and if any of them would make good or decent
[17:54.160 --> 17:56.880]  hybrids, they sign it with thanks from big T.
[17:57.480 --> 18:01.640]  Then they say you and white Mike should come to Australia as consultants to our
[18:01.640 --> 18:03.840]  government on legalization.
[18:05.120 --> 18:05.960]  I'd love to.
[18:06.240 --> 18:08.960]  I'm not sure I want to go there because everything there is trying to fucking
[18:08.960 --> 18:09.800]  kill me.
[18:10.040 --> 18:10.800]  Not in the city.
[18:10.840 --> 18:13.120]  Not in the city. All right, we'll be cool. Yeah. Take good care of us.
[18:13.760 --> 18:14.960]  Just 90% of the stuff.
[18:14.960 --> 18:17.200]  90% of the rest of the city stuff.
[18:17.480 --> 18:19.040]  So if we go out of that little line,
[18:19.280 --> 18:21.680]  we're going to get murdered by some crazy animal and I'm just playing.
[18:21.920 --> 18:25.280]  Australia's got a reputation for having some crazy fucking wildlife out there.
[18:25.720 --> 18:29.920]  Uh, I'm interested. Let's go. Let's go grow some Australian cannabis.
[18:31.080 --> 18:35.480]  Let's do it. Ooh, that may be a thing. Um, so, um, let's see, where do we start?
[18:35.760 --> 18:39.680]  He wants to know if he's got bubble gum, AK 47,
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.880]  purple Hayes and white widow seeds.
[18:42.200 --> 18:46.360]  And he's wondering my opinions on these varieties and if any of them would make
[18:46.640 --> 18:49.000]  good or decent hybrids.
[18:50.760 --> 18:52.120]  I can't see your plants.
[18:52.520 --> 18:55.520]  I can see your list of strains, which you have got.
[18:55.880 --> 18:59.800]  And I can hope that those are truly the genetics that that seed package claims
[18:59.800 --> 19:02.520]  they are. I don't know where the bubble gum came from.
[19:02.520 --> 19:04.520]  I don't know where the AK 47 came from.
[19:04.520 --> 19:07.160]  I don't know where the purple Hayes or the white widow seeds came from.
[19:07.640 --> 19:09.160]  I knew who originally bred those.
[19:09.320 --> 19:09.560]  Yeah.
[19:09.560 --> 19:14.360]  What makes me nervous about those that strain list is it sounds oddly
[19:15.080 --> 19:17.560]  familiar from our kind of distant past.
[19:18.560 --> 19:22.160]  You know, I was, I thought the same, but also they're in Australia,
[19:22.280 --> 19:26.480]  so they may culture takes a little time to travel. Maybe that's where they are.
[19:26.480 --> 19:30.320]  Maybe they're still in their time capsule is still there with those genetics.
[19:30.320 --> 19:33.880]  So I was going to let that slide and not judge too harshly on that. But yes,
[19:33.880 --> 19:34.720]  that is like,
[19:34.880 --> 19:37.880]  that's like having a bunch of Mickey Mantle rookie cards back in the day.
[19:37.880 --> 19:40.120]  You've got some pretty good stuff there. If that's real,
[19:40.400 --> 19:41.520]  you've got some great shit.
[19:41.840 --> 19:45.240]  I don't want to question or doubt the legitimacy of these seeds.
[19:45.480 --> 19:47.200]  I know who bred most of those things.
[19:47.240 --> 19:50.280]  I know who I would like to see on the packaging for most of those,
[19:50.280 --> 19:53.480]  but I don't know what you've got. So without seeing the packaging,
[19:53.480 --> 19:56.880]  without seeing the seeds, I don't know if what those are.
[19:58.040 --> 20:02.400]  Also, I can't see the plants. I don't see your phenotypes.
[20:02.440 --> 20:03.920]  I don't know what you've got to work with.
[20:04.320 --> 20:08.440]  That is kind of how on paper I could look at the genetics.
[20:08.440 --> 20:10.200]  And I know that white widow is great to breed with.
[20:10.200 --> 20:12.000]  I know that I would like to breed with the white widow.
[20:12.000 --> 20:14.400]  I've grown bubble gum and AK.
[20:14.680 --> 20:17.920]  I could probably think of some creative ways to breed around there.
[20:17.920 --> 20:20.320]  Some cubes, some triangles, some open pollinations.
[20:20.320 --> 20:23.840]  I could think of great things to do, but without seeing the plants,
[20:24.480 --> 20:28.320]  I don't know what would work best. I need to see each plant.
[20:28.880 --> 20:33.720]  That is, I think as a breeder, I'm kind of like a plant matchmaker.
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.440]  I've got to find two plants that I've got to look at them and grow them and
[20:37.440 --> 20:39.440]  touch them and smell them and experience them.
[20:39.440 --> 20:42.920]  Picking from a list like this is sort of like trying to pick two people who are
[20:42.920 --> 20:44.960]  going to hit it off from names in a phone book.
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.760]  I was going to make that analogy pretty soon. I was going to be like,
[20:47.760 --> 20:50.560]  so do you think Bill and Karen will get along?
[20:51.600 --> 20:54.120]  I have no idea. We don't know anything about Bill or Karen.
[20:54.800 --> 20:58.600]  Just two white people, probably Bill and Karen. Like we have no input on them.
[20:58.600 --> 21:02.680]  So I don't know how these are going to breed. I wish that I had more input.
[21:03.160 --> 21:04.560]  So if you do choose to breed with them,
[21:04.560 --> 21:07.520]  I would pick one or two packs of seeds and I would get those started.
[21:07.760 --> 21:09.160]  I would select a couple of males,
[21:09.160 --> 21:12.480]  a couple of females that really stand out for whatever reasons you believe.
[21:12.480 --> 21:14.880]  You're the breeder now, you get to make those decisions.
[21:15.360 --> 21:20.360]  And then I would work projects as desired from there. As Mike said a second ago,
[21:20.360 --> 21:23.960]  it sounds like you've got four different packs of seeds to choose from.
[21:23.960 --> 21:27.200]  So you've definitely got enough stuff to start a breeding project.
[21:27.560 --> 21:31.520]  The thing is that you have to do it by looking at the plants. You can't just do it.
[21:31.720 --> 21:33.320]  These all look good on paper.
[21:33.600 --> 21:36.080]  Yeah. Until you see them in front of you, it's hard to tell.
[21:36.280 --> 21:37.880]  Yeah. You've got, they all look good on paper,
[21:37.880 --> 21:40.320]  but you don't know which males are going to look good,
[21:40.340 --> 21:41.600]  which females are going to look good.
[21:42.160 --> 21:44.720]  You'll have something to do some sort of a breeding project.
[21:44.720 --> 21:47.560]  If you pop two packs of seeds, if you pop three packs of seeds,
[21:47.560 --> 21:48.320]  you'll find something,
[21:48.320 --> 21:51.880]  find a solid male out of there that looks like it'll work perfectly for you.
[21:52.200 --> 21:56.760]  And then find a girl from all three packs of seeds so that you've got maybe a
[21:56.760 --> 22:01.560]  bubblegum female and AK 47 female and a white widow female,
[22:01.640 --> 22:04.880]  and then perhaps a white widow male and pollinate all three of the girls with
[22:04.920 --> 22:06.960]  the one male you can make white widow F twos,
[22:07.280 --> 22:11.960]  and then you can make a white bubble gum and you can make AK bubble gum 47.
[22:12.120 --> 22:15.600]  I'll take a quarter of each of that or AK white widow 47.
[22:16.080 --> 22:18.360]  And it's just that way you can do a little bit of breeding and then you get to
[22:18.360 --> 22:20.760]  grow all those seeds. You'll have a lot of seeds to play with,
[22:21.040 --> 22:23.720]  but that's probably the way that I would do it. I would grow them.
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.640]  You got to grow them. You got to be,
[22:25.640 --> 22:28.320]  I can't be a matchmaker without knowing some personalities.
[22:28.600 --> 22:32.480]  It doesn't work out that way. And if you want to make some feminized stuff,
[22:32.480 --> 22:35.960]  then you just got to find a solid female and then reverse it and then pollinate
[22:35.960 --> 22:39.520]  the same cultivar, a different clone of the same cultivar,
[22:39.960 --> 22:43.840]  and you can make your feminized seeds. I wish I had better input for you,
[22:43.840 --> 22:47.080]  my friend, uh, without seeing the plants, I really don't know what to tell you.
[22:47.160 --> 22:49.360]  I on paper, I know what would look good. Of course,
[22:49.360 --> 22:51.360]  I like the white widow as a, as a male,
[22:51.360 --> 22:53.720]  just because there are a lot of traits I would stay personally.
[22:53.720 --> 22:55.000]  I wouldn't breed with the purple Hayes.
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.400]  That's going to put a lot of extended time flowering time into everything.
[22:59.680 --> 23:01.560]  And it's just not one of my favorites, but
[23:02.280 --> 23:04.880]  that pretty sure Australia's got a long summer growth season.
[23:05.160 --> 23:06.000]  Well, this could also,
[23:06.040 --> 23:09.360]  the purple Hayes could also be this person's favorite fucking strain and it's
[23:09.600 --> 23:10.880]  doesn't get my attention at all.
[23:10.880 --> 23:15.160]  I'm a fan of a lot of Hayes's and watching them sort of slowly disappear because
[23:15.160 --> 23:19.240]  they take more than nine weeks has been hard for me to deal with. So.
[23:19.560 --> 23:22.360]  Yeah. The market has definitely changed. Well,
[23:22.360 --> 23:23.960]  this one comes from our friend big T.
[23:23.960 --> 23:26.840]  So thanks to big T for sending us a great message.
[23:27.840 --> 23:31.480]  And they also say, PS, white Mike should come down and be consultants for,
[23:31.600 --> 23:34.640]  and they don't want us to go consult on the grow or anything.
[23:35.040 --> 23:39.000]  Want us to fix the gov. They want us to go help them legalize cannabis.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.240]  I think what we got to go do is go down there and set up the podcast setup.
[23:42.240 --> 23:45.320]  Just like we've got this, we've got to take a rig. We got to take some flowers.
[23:45.360 --> 23:46.400]  I'll be your ambassador.
[23:46.880 --> 23:49.320]  And then we got to go smoke down. And while we're smoking,
[23:49.320 --> 23:52.240]  we need to be interviewed by people so that they can see that we can medicate
[23:52.260 --> 23:55.600]  properly and we can still produce and act like, and act like,
[23:55.680 --> 23:59.000]  what was it called? Responsible, productive citizens. What do you want to call us?
[23:59.560 --> 24:03.680]  Responsible, productive citizens is pretty much exactly what I like to be called.
[24:03.880 --> 24:06.320]  Pretty much exactly. You sound like one of my old bosses.
[24:06.720 --> 24:08.600]  And throw a handsome in there and I'm happy.
[24:09.280 --> 24:10.160]  Don't make me edit this.
[24:11.480 --> 24:14.320]  All right, Mike, let's keep moving with this. I've got another email.
[24:14.760 --> 24:16.960]  If you've been listening to the show regularly,
[24:17.080 --> 24:18.760]  that was harder to say than it should have been. Well,
[24:18.920 --> 24:20.800]  if you have been listening regularly,
[24:21.040 --> 24:22.880]  you may remember that in a recent episode,
[24:22.880 --> 24:27.640]  we read an email from a friend of ours who grew and smoked some lemon Jeffrey
[24:27.640 --> 24:32.520]  that he flowered for 11 weeks. If I remember correctly, it blew his mind.
[24:32.520 --> 24:37.080]  I asked for more information. He was listening. We've got more information.
[24:37.080 --> 24:38.560]  Magic of the internet, baby.
[24:38.840 --> 24:43.840]  The magic. It says it was a trip to hear you and Mike read and react to my email.
[24:44.840 --> 24:46.920]  Um, I'm glad you liked that. That's why I read the reviews.
[24:46.920 --> 24:49.080]  It's a trip to read your reaction to our words, bro.
[24:49.120 --> 24:52.080]  It's a trip to read your reaction to our reaction, man.
[24:52.600 --> 24:56.520]  Uh, it goes on to say, I bought the pack of lemon Jeffrey from dank seed.
[24:56.520 --> 25:01.520]  I think I only popped one seed because it was all I had room for at the time.
[25:01.760 --> 25:04.560]  So an old vendor that we don't work with. Uh, yeah,
[25:04.560 --> 25:06.720]  I was going to say an old vendor that we're no longer working with,
[25:06.720 --> 25:09.200]  but there are plenty of other good opportunities.
[25:09.600 --> 25:12.800]  Check out seeds here now or the hell a dank seed company.
[25:13.600 --> 25:17.000]  I'm pretty sure he means the old dank seed. So that is not hell a dank seed.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.280]  Company. We do still do business with them, support them.
[25:19.600 --> 25:21.520]  Let's keep moving before it gets confusing. He says,
[25:21.520 --> 25:26.120]  I wanted to make sure I had room to trellis. So he only had one, one plant.
[25:26.120 --> 25:26.960]  He wanted room.
[25:27.160 --> 25:32.160]  The plant filled up about a two by three foot canopy and he let a lot of smaller
[25:32.880 --> 25:37.240]  nugs go full term to avoid getting any really thick buds.
[25:37.240 --> 25:41.880]  He said, airflow is never good enough for a closet tent in our state.
[25:41.880 --> 25:46.000]  I'll leave his state out of there. We don't need to narrow down his location.
[25:46.440 --> 25:50.280]  So he got one lemon Jeffrey seed. He grew it in a two by three area,
[25:50.720 --> 25:54.040]  a lot of smaller nugs. He says, even at 11 weeks,
[25:54.040 --> 25:57.720]  I wasn't seeing much Amber except at the very top of the plant.
[25:58.120 --> 26:02.200]  I was thinking I'd probably stalled or slowed them along the way with a
[26:02.200 --> 26:03.040]  misstep.
[26:03.400 --> 26:07.360]  I wish there were more details on there because I would assume that that is what
[26:07.360 --> 26:09.800]  messed them up, a misstep, something slowed them down.
[26:09.800 --> 26:13.560]  I don't see that plant taking 11 weeks. So there, yeah,
[26:13.560 --> 26:17.760]  I wish I knew more about what your supposed or possible misstep was.
[26:17.760 --> 26:19.600]  Cause I assume that's going to be what slowed them down.
[26:19.640 --> 26:23.040]  But man, whatever you did, it sounds like you made some amazing mistakes.
[26:23.480 --> 26:24.400]  Uh, it goes on to say,
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.280]  I pressed Rosin pretty early after harvest and it had a slightly darker to look
[26:29.560 --> 26:32.880]  leading me to believe that the trikes were mature.
[26:32.920 --> 26:36.080]  So maybe he wasn't looking, didn't see that they were actually Amber,
[26:36.440 --> 26:38.000]  but the Rosin did come out.
[26:39.880 --> 26:42.560]  Yeah. What kind of loop are you looking with? How, how good your scope,
[26:42.600 --> 26:46.160]  do you need to clean your lens? He keeps going. I didn't push her much at all.
[26:46.160 --> 26:48.360]  Meaning he didn't feed her a lot is what I'm going to assume.
[26:48.360 --> 26:51.480]  That means at a nice organic amended soil.
[26:51.480 --> 26:55.120]  And I supplemented with one quarter strength, organic bottled nudes,
[26:55.440 --> 27:00.400]  and some top dressing and microbes that that makes it taste really
[27:00.400 --> 27:04.360]  good. If you don't overfeed the lemon, Jeffrey, she comes out nice and sweet.
[27:04.840 --> 27:05.440]  That goes on to say,
[27:05.440 --> 27:09.400]  I did not keep a clone of this one as I had to break off the grow for a couple
[27:09.400 --> 27:13.920]  of months. That's understandable. It says I'm back on it now. Yeah.
[27:14.320 --> 27:16.960]  Welcome back, bro. I bet it feels great to be back growing again.
[27:16.960 --> 27:18.880]  It always sucks to have to tear down the growth for a minute.
[27:19.440 --> 27:23.120]  We don't know where you are. I do know where you are. Sometimes shit goes on,
[27:23.120 --> 27:25.760]  especially there. So be careful. Where are we?
[27:25.760 --> 27:29.600]  It says my wife and I polished off our last lemon Jeffrey this morning,
[27:29.840 --> 27:34.040]  and we will be on dispensary for a while, man. I'm sorry about that.
[27:34.040 --> 27:35.960]  He says it's heartbreaking and expensive.
[27:36.560 --> 27:40.400]  I hope you can find some quality dispensary buds around there. Yeah. It's,
[27:40.440 --> 27:43.000]  it's rough to go from your personal back to the store shelf.
[27:43.920 --> 27:47.560]  Why'd you give me that look, Mike? It's just, that's, that's just life, man.
[27:47.680 --> 27:51.000]  I get it. I get it. Uh, there is more to this great message.
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.040]  It says the next run of lemon Jeffrey will be at least two plants.
[27:55.320 --> 27:59.840]  So I can harvest one a little earlier and taster as intended by the breeder and
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.560]  another. So I can revisit this late harvest again and compare.
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.320]  Now I'm curious if that misstep will show in this next trial, right?
[28:09.320 --> 28:14.120]  Stumble at the same spot again in the same way or don't and see if that 11 week
[28:14.120 --> 28:18.720]  flower is really what that plant needs. If it works twice, then it's not an accident.
[28:18.720 --> 28:20.320]  There's something cool about that. Right.
[28:20.520 --> 28:22.320]  But maybe it might've been that misstep.
[28:22.320 --> 28:24.480]  We don't know unless we try again and don't do that.
[28:24.800 --> 28:26.880]  And then we have to keep trying under different conditions.
[28:27.280 --> 28:29.640]  I like running experiments. They can go forever.
[28:31.200 --> 28:35.920]  There is more. It says, uh, thanks again, Mike. And thanks again, Rasta, Jeff.
[28:35.960 --> 28:40.280]  You guys are the shiz and then they signed it with no
[28:40.480 --> 28:44.320]  name. Excellent way to sign it. Yeah. Especially from the state.
[28:44.320 --> 28:48.320]  They revealed that they are from, Hey, thank you. No names for the great email.
[28:48.440 --> 28:50.320]  Thanks for the update on the lemon Jeffrey.
[28:50.600 --> 28:55.400]  I look forward to hearing how the next grow goes and I really look forward to
[28:55.400 --> 28:59.680]  photos of the next girl. I know you're down there in a dangerous location,
[29:00.040 --> 29:03.520]  but if you can sneak a few shots in, you don't have to post them to social media.
[29:03.520 --> 29:07.040]  I do have an email account. You can easily shoot them to the email.
[29:07.680 --> 29:09.880]  Mike's given me that sour face. What's that mean, buddy?
[29:10.040 --> 29:13.480]  I just three bad jokes went through my head instead of making them.
[29:13.480 --> 29:17.440]  I just cringed. I appreciate that. So send me an email. Uh,
[29:17.600 --> 29:21.280]  I really want, we want to follow this little grow where we dig it. Yeah.
[29:21.280 --> 29:22.960]  I like the small steps. They're fun to see,
[29:23.040 --> 29:25.440]  see what you're producing out of there to go big, to,
[29:25.440 --> 29:30.400]  to have a blast growing at home. One plant, two plants popping one seed at a time.
[29:30.880 --> 29:33.240]  That's there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
[29:33.240 --> 29:34.800]  Grow your heart out one seed at a time.
[29:35.240 --> 29:38.760]  Somebody made a joke today and another podcast I participate in.
[29:38.760 --> 29:43.480]  I'm also on the embracing organics live podcast on YouTube every Thursday at
[29:43.480 --> 29:48.120]  seven Mountain time. Um, but I was on there and somebody said something about,
[29:48.120 --> 29:52.000]  I know I'm just a basement grower, so excuse me, Jeff. And I was like, Oh bro,
[29:52.920 --> 29:56.880]  uh, not to interrupt you, but I was like, I, I am a basement grower. Yes.
[29:56.880 --> 29:59.120]  I have a lot of commercial experience. Yes.
[29:59.120 --> 30:02.080]  I have been a lot of places through and for growing,
[30:02.440 --> 30:04.800]  but like almost all of us,
[30:04.800 --> 30:09.080]  I started with a light in the basement and I still remember those days.
[30:09.080 --> 30:13.560]  I still honor those days. I still appreciate and respect those days.
[30:13.840 --> 30:18.440]  I've got as much love and respect for a basement grower as I do a guy with 20
[30:18.440 --> 30:23.400]  lights as I do for a guy with 50 to a hundred to 500 lights. We're all growers.
[30:23.400 --> 30:25.400]  We're all doing the same shit. It's all a passion.
[30:25.720 --> 30:28.760]  We're all in it because we love growing. We love cannabis.
[30:28.760 --> 30:31.520]  We love the effects of cannabis. Uh, so don't,
[30:32.040 --> 30:34.840]  don't think that I think I'm hot shit because I'm a commercial grower.
[30:35.080 --> 30:38.680]  I got nothing but love for the basement grower. That's where I started.
[30:38.680 --> 30:41.720]  That's where I came from. Uh, never forget your roots.
[30:41.720 --> 30:43.440]  I'm a basement grower kind of guy.
[30:43.440 --> 30:45.600]  I know I talk about get out of the basement mentality,
[30:45.880 --> 30:49.480]  get in the commercial grow mindset. If that's where you are, if, dude,
[30:49.480 --> 30:50.920]  I still got a drum set in the basement.
[30:51.120 --> 30:55.960]  I've played huge fucking places and I have just as much fun and just as much
[30:56.000 --> 30:59.160]  passion to when I'm playing in the basement on Thursday night before I have to
[30:59.160 --> 31:02.560]  do a podcast after dinner, just killing an hour, I have the greatest time.
[31:02.560 --> 31:05.600]  So whatever you're doing, if you do it with your heart and you enjoy it,
[31:05.760 --> 31:06.960]  I got mad respect for it.
[31:06.960 --> 31:10.640]  So don't ever think that just cause I've gotten real far that I got any sort of,
[31:10.640 --> 31:13.200]  I'm not belittling any basement grower at all.
[31:13.240 --> 31:14.640]  You don't got to go big to be awesome.
[31:15.040 --> 31:19.600]  You know, they have more of a struggle than us. I can call,
[31:20.000 --> 31:21.800]  I'm not going to say the name of our vendors or anybody.
[31:22.120 --> 31:25.840]  I can call people in another state or in another County, a couple miles North,
[31:26.040 --> 31:28.240]  and go, Hey, I need a pallet of this, two pallets of this,
[31:28.240 --> 31:31.280]  five bottles of this and this. They put it on a company credit card.
[31:31.280 --> 31:32.440]  They show up with a semi,
[31:32.760 --> 31:37.280]  we get a forklift and pull a fucking pallet of stuff out into a warehouse,
[31:37.520 --> 31:40.720]  high five the driver and sign for it. You can't do that at your home.
[31:40.720 --> 31:42.920]  Grow. You got to go in some places.
[31:43.040 --> 31:46.280]  To do a throwback earlier when they're asking about gorilla growing,
[31:46.400 --> 31:48.000]  a lot of those tips are the same for,
[31:48.040 --> 31:50.760]  for home growing somewhere where you ain't supposed to be homegrown or where
[31:50.760 --> 31:54.680]  it's brand new. Um, if I was on an East coast,
[31:54.680 --> 31:57.480]  if I was in an East coast state, right, as they were going legal,
[31:58.120 --> 32:02.360]  I'd still be just as nervous as I was here when we were just going legal with
[32:02.520 --> 32:05.920]  growing a home and stuff, because it's still worth several thousand a pound.
[32:06.440 --> 32:08.920]  And that's still your ass. If the wrong people hear about it.
[32:09.000 --> 32:12.840]  Yep. Yep. See, and yet you have to be careful not because of just the thieves,
[32:12.840 --> 32:17.720]  but because of the law and you have to leave the law, the hassle, the headache.
[32:18.000 --> 32:19.800]  You got to drive one car to the growth store,
[32:19.800 --> 32:21.880]  drive it to your friend's house, park in the garage,
[32:21.880 --> 32:23.920]  get all the shit out of that car, put it in your car,
[32:23.920 --> 32:26.840]  drive your car to your house, to the garage unload.
[32:27.040 --> 32:30.640]  For a while, my hustle was buying supplies for growers.
[32:30.760 --> 32:34.600]  Like that was the thing I did for side money was I would call up my
[32:35.600 --> 32:38.440]  growers. I knew get my shopping list for the day,
[32:38.920 --> 32:42.280]  go fill their shopping lists, go home, repackage it.
[32:42.800 --> 32:46.000]  And then later that, that day or the next day go deliver it all.
[32:46.560 --> 32:50.200]  Like that was a major side hustle for a minute when things were just started to
[32:50.200 --> 32:51.040]  turn the corner.
[32:51.680 --> 32:55.880]  Things are so different now. So yeah, my, my point is no disrespect to,
[32:55.920 --> 32:58.040]  however big your grow is. If you're trying,
[32:58.040 --> 33:01.640]  you are on team cannabis and I am on your team. I want to support you.
[33:01.840 --> 33:04.880]  You're one of us. That was what I'm trying to say. Hey Mike,
[33:04.880 --> 33:08.040]  we've been going for 30 something minutes. You ready to wrap up this podcast?
[33:08.160 --> 33:10.080]  We should. All right. Let's uh,
