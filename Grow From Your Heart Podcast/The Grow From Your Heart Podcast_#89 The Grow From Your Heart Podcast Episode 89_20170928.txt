[00:17.080 --> 00:21.480]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 89 of the
[00:21.480 --> 00:25.640]  Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:25.640 --> 00:29.140]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:29.140 --> 00:32.380]  grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:32.380 --> 00:35.000]  activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.420]  cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, they call me
[00:39.420 --> 00:43.320]  Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining me. As always, I need to send a huge thank you
[00:43.320 --> 00:46.280]  shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting me use their music on the show.
[00:46.280 --> 00:50.960]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew. What's up, you guys?
[00:50.960 --> 00:55.080]  I hope everybody's having a great day. I'm coming to you on a scorching hot
[00:55.080 --> 00:58.960]  Thursday. It is stupid hot today, but we're gonna deal with it. We're gonna
[00:58.960 --> 01:01.920]  drink a lot of water, we're gonna water up the plants, and then we're gonna talk
[01:01.920 --> 01:05.880]  a little bit about some heat issues that some friends of mine have been having in
[01:05.880 --> 01:09.520]  their gardens, and we'll talk about ways to cure a little bit of heat problems,
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.000]  and then I've got some ranting to do, but before we get that far, this podcast is
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.560]  brought to you by my friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Hygro Indoor
[01:17.560 --> 01:21.520]  Growing Supplies has two locations to serve Colorado. Visit the Denver store at
[01:21.520 --> 01:26.440]  6271 Beach Street or check out the Pueblo location on 618 East 4th Street
[01:26.440 --> 01:30.480]  in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado. Check out Hygro for competitive pricing and a
[01:30.480 --> 01:33.800]  great selection of indoor growth supplies. You guys, when you're checking
[01:33.800 --> 01:36.880]  out at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies, make sure you let them know you listen
[01:36.880 --> 01:40.440]  to the Grow From Your Heart podcast, and they will give you commercial pricing on
[01:40.520 --> 01:44.280]  your entire purchase. That's right, you'll pay what I pay, it'll put some money back
[01:44.280 --> 01:49.520]  in your pocket. You guys, we all know that money is expensive these days. All right,
[01:49.520 --> 01:52.520]  we're gonna get on with the show here. I want to let you guys know that I am
[01:52.520 --> 01:57.520]  recording with a new device. Today I'm using the new Zoom H6 Handy Recorder. I
[01:57.520 --> 02:01.720]  got the Zoom H6 so that I'll be able to take this podcast on the road a little
[02:01.720 --> 02:05.680]  bit. It's a much smaller unit than what I've been using. This thing will fit in
[02:05.680 --> 02:10.280]  my back pocket, and I can carry it around, and I can do shows from events such as
[02:10.280 --> 02:14.560]  the Secret Cup, the Cannabis Cup, or wherever we may be. So you guys, look
[02:14.560 --> 02:18.520]  forward to episodes with special guests coming up, because now I can take the
[02:18.520 --> 02:22.480]  show to them instead of trying to get people to come to me. I live in kind of a
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.680]  shitty part of Colorado where nobody wants to go, so it's hard to get like
[02:26.680 --> 02:30.720]  Damsel and Hunt and people like that to come here. But if I go to them, they're
[02:30.720 --> 02:34.680]  happy to be on the show. So spend a few bucks, I got the Zoom H6, we will take
[02:34.680 --> 02:38.360]  this show on the road. You guys, I'm gonna ask you to do me a favor. Since you're
[02:38.360 --> 02:40.960]  listening to the show, let me know what you think of the sound quality. Let me
[02:40.960 --> 02:44.720]  know if this quality is acceptable. Let me know if I've changed anything that
[02:44.720 --> 02:48.600]  you've noticed, because if this isn't acceptable, I'll go back to using the
[02:48.600 --> 02:52.480]  main studio setup. I just wanted to pull this out, give it a try, see what it was
[02:52.480 --> 02:56.840]  like before I try to take it on the road and record with other people. So yeah, big
[02:56.840 --> 02:59.640]  shout out to the Zoom H6. Let me know what you think of it, you guys.
[02:59.640 --> 03:05.520]  Alright, so let's get into the show. I told you that I saw some ducting issues.
[03:05.720 --> 03:08.840]  I did a consultation for a friend of mine. I didn't even charge him for it the
[03:08.840 --> 03:11.520]  other day, but he's been saying, dude, my room is getting way too hot this summer.
[03:11.520 --> 03:15.480]  What can I do? And I was like, you know what? That's a good start of a podcast. So
[03:15.480 --> 03:20.960]  I walked in there and the first thing I see is messy ass ducting. This dude's
[03:20.960 --> 03:23.800]  got a decent grow room, he's got enough air conditioning, his plants look good,
[03:23.800 --> 03:28.360]  but his ducting was a complete mess, you guys. And I've seen a lot of messy
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.400]  ducting lately on my visits and consultations. So one thing I want to
[03:32.400 --> 03:36.480]  tell you is keep in mind that every single twist and bend in your ducting
[03:36.480 --> 03:40.640]  reduces your airflow and adds to the workload of your blower. Whatever kind of
[03:40.640 --> 03:45.760]  inline fan you're using, every bend puts more strain and more pressure on that
[03:45.760 --> 03:50.560]  inline fan and slows down the amount of air you're moving. So ideally, ducting
[03:50.560 --> 03:54.480]  would be in a straight line with zero curves or bends or twists or anything
[03:54.480 --> 03:57.200]  like that. But I know that's not rational because of course we're
[03:57.200 --> 04:00.960]  growing in houses and things like that and you have to move the air around in
[04:00.960 --> 04:04.800]  not a straight line sometimes. But try to get it as straight as you can. That'll
[04:04.800 --> 04:08.000]  save you a lot of money on heating costs. It'll save you money because you don't
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.680]  have to run the blower as hard. It'll save you money because you're more
[04:10.680 --> 04:15.320]  efficiently cooling. So straighten out. Oh I just noticed something. When you put
[04:15.320 --> 04:18.440]  the cell phone too close to the h6 you get a little bit of interference. So
[04:18.440 --> 04:20.560]  that's good to know. Sorry about that guys. I hope you didn't hear that too
[04:20.560 --> 04:24.120]  much. I'm reading notes off of my cell phone here which is why I did that. Anyway
[04:24.120 --> 04:27.560]  try to keep your ducting in a straight line. Another great way to save some
[04:27.560 --> 04:32.200]  money on cooling you guys would be to run your lights at night.
[04:32.200 --> 04:37.480]  Kilowatts from the electric company are actually cheaper at night. So if you're
[04:37.480 --> 04:41.680]  not running your electricity at peak hours it'll save you a few bucks. So what
[04:41.680 --> 04:44.520]  I would recommend if you can do it and this will only work for some people on
[04:44.520 --> 04:49.000]  your lifestyle, your schedule. If you can have your plants come on right around
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.520]  here it gets dark about nine o'clock eight or nine o'clock ish right now. It
[04:52.520 --> 04:57.680]  would be ideal to have your lights come on at 9 p.m. That way it's cool outside
[04:57.680 --> 05:02.680]  the sun has gone down the lights kick on and that way you're not fighting the sun
[05:02.680 --> 05:06.280]  all day. You're not adding sun and grow lights to that grow room to try to cool
[05:06.280 --> 05:12.440]  down. So turn on your lights at night if you can. That'll help you out. Alright so
[05:12.440 --> 05:14.720]  you guys straighten out your ducting. Run your light cycle at night and you'll
[05:14.720 --> 05:17.880]  save a few bucks on cooling costs. Getting your plants too hot is gonna
[05:17.880 --> 05:21.360]  cause them to become fluffy and it's gonna decrease your harvest weight. So
[05:21.360 --> 05:24.840]  when you've got electricity bills to cover every gram counts. So you got to do
[05:24.840 --> 05:28.840]  your best to pull every gram you can out of the room since you've got to pay for
[05:28.840 --> 05:32.400]  every kilowatt that you've used. So figure out how to get the ducting
[05:32.400 --> 05:36.200]  straight. Start running your lights at night and that will help you out quite a
[05:36.200 --> 05:38.920]  bit. Something else you guys could keep in mind during these hot summer months
[05:38.920 --> 05:43.440]  is humidity. As the temperatures rise the humidity outside is rising also. So be
[05:43.440 --> 05:47.560]  aware of how humid your rooms are. This is the first year that I have personally
[05:47.560 --> 05:51.640]  needed to go buy a dehumidifier for my main flowering room. Fans and air
[05:51.640 --> 05:55.040]  conditioning are not enough sometimes you guys. You need to remove the stagnant
[05:55.040 --> 05:59.080]  humid air from your rooms and replace it with fresh co2 rich air for your plants.
[05:59.080 --> 06:02.920]  So you guys make sure you're pulling that air out. That hot air needs to be
[06:02.920 --> 06:07.600]  sucked out. Alright one more thing I can think of to help you keep your rooms
[06:07.600 --> 06:11.400]  cool is to pay attention to the filters in your air conditioners guys. Those
[06:11.400 --> 06:16.080]  filters are designed to last for a year without being replaced. But keep in mind
[06:16.080 --> 06:19.560]  you guys are running them in a grow room where there may be a lot of extra
[06:19.560 --> 06:23.520]  dirt, a lot of humidity, and there's a lot of extra work on that unit. They don't
[06:23.520 --> 06:26.840]  expect that unit to be competing with four or five or six whatever you got
[06:26.840 --> 06:30.400]  that many thousand watt lights. They don't expect that thing to come on when
[06:30.400 --> 06:34.120]  you buy it and never shut off like a lot of us do with an air conditioner. So if
[06:34.120 --> 06:37.040]  you've got an air conditioner that has filters, replace those. Once they get
[06:37.040 --> 06:41.440]  clogged up, the air doesn't flow through, you don't get as much cooling,
[06:41.440 --> 06:44.840]  you're wasting electricity. That electricity is not turning into a gram
[06:44.840 --> 06:48.640]  of weed so you're flushing money down the toilet basically. Your air
[06:48.640 --> 06:51.600]  conditioner may require a little extra maintenance since we're working it so
[06:51.600 --> 06:54.160]  hard you guys. And also keep in mind where you're putting your air
[06:54.160 --> 06:57.680]  conditioner. It may suck up a little bit more dirt and shit like that just
[06:57.680 --> 07:01.920]  depending on where you have put it. Alright so that was a good little rant.
[07:01.920 --> 07:04.720]  Since we're talking about replacing things and things that you need to
[07:04.720 --> 07:07.880]  upgrade in your grow room, I figured I'd make a little kind of a checklist of
[07:07.880 --> 07:11.720]  things that would be a good idea to replace and check on. One thing that you
[07:11.720 --> 07:16.680]  guys need to replace is your bulbs in your grow rooms. The HID bulbs don't last
[07:16.680 --> 07:20.760]  forever. If you're using good bulbs, you can switch those out about once every
[07:20.760 --> 07:25.240]  six months or if you've got the budget, you can toss them every two crops which
[07:25.240 --> 07:29.040]  would be about every four months. That's only if you're using them only as a
[07:29.040 --> 07:32.440]  flowering cycle. If you're buying those cheap Plant Max bulbs you guys or
[07:32.440 --> 07:35.480]  whatever generic brand you're buying at your grow shop, I would recommend
[07:35.480 --> 07:39.680]  replacing those every single flowering cycle. Those aren't high-quality bulbs
[07:39.680 --> 07:43.360]  and they burn out a little bit quickly. Alright if you're using those cheap
[07:43.360 --> 07:46.400]  bulbs guys, what I would recommend is harvest the room, empty the room, clean
[07:46.400 --> 07:50.040]  it out and replace those bulbs before you put new plants in there again. If
[07:50.040 --> 07:53.960]  you're using good bulbs, you can go probably two cycles, maybe three. I
[07:53.960 --> 07:58.080]  definitely wouldn't go past four flowering cycles with the same bulb. I
[07:58.080 --> 08:02.560]  would replace that. The bulb will stop putting out as much light but it will
[08:02.560 --> 08:06.240]  still be sucking up as much electricity. It will still be making as much heat and
[08:06.600 --> 08:10.800]  again you're not turning those kilowatts into grams of weed which is your goal.
[08:10.800 --> 08:14.280]  You don't want to pay for electricity that is just causing heat which is
[08:14.280 --> 08:18.680]  making your air conditioner run stronger which is pulling more electricity. You
[08:18.680 --> 08:22.320]  see the cycle here. Alright so don't forget that your bulbs in your veg area
[08:22.320 --> 08:24.880]  are just as important as in your flowering room you guys. You got to swap
[08:24.880 --> 08:29.600]  those bulbs out occasionally also. I like those new 315 bulbs. I'll reason those at
[08:29.600 --> 08:34.160]  the shop. They seem to put out quite a bit of light and they're affordable so
[08:34.160 --> 08:37.800]  if you guys can afford the 315s I would definitely recommend those. If you want
[08:37.800 --> 08:42.000]  to go with your metal halide bulbs I would recommend those again every every
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.920]  two months, every four months, every six months at the very longest. You guys I
[08:45.920 --> 08:48.940]  wouldn't run longer than six months on the same bulb no matter what you're
[08:48.940 --> 08:52.680]  doing with it. If you've got those T5 bulbs you're gonna need to replace those
[08:52.680 --> 08:56.480]  quite frequently. Those things just crap out and what I've noticed about the T5s
[08:56.480 --> 09:00.720]  if you buy a fixture with like eight T5s in it just pretty much plan on replacing
[09:00.720 --> 09:04.960]  all eight T5 bulbs all at the same time because they're all just gonna start
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.760]  shitting out. When one goes out just go buy the whole set. Alright you guys we've
[09:09.760 --> 09:12.800]  talked about replacing your bulbs now what about the ballasts? If you're using
[09:12.800 --> 09:17.120]  modern digital ballasts they'll last a while. Most of them come
[09:17.120 --> 09:20.920]  with a nice warranty so you didn't hear this from me but anything that comes
[09:20.920 --> 09:24.800]  with a warranty that will be replaced because of the warranty I make sure to
[09:24.800 --> 09:28.560]  break that thing about a month or two before the warranty is up. Sometimes a
[09:28.560 --> 09:32.360]  few months before the warranty is up just break it just fucking break it and
[09:32.360 --> 09:35.000]  then go get another one on the warranty because these companies are charging you
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.320]  enough for shit anyway. It should last a while break it and go get a new one
[09:38.320 --> 09:40.760]  they're gonna refurbish the one that you've got they're gonna resell it as a
[09:40.760 --> 09:44.280]  refurbished unit. Don't worry about them they make plenty of money just break the
[09:44.280 --> 09:48.200]  fucking thing right before the warranty is up and get yourself a new one. If
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.840]  you're using those old magnetic ballasts those things will go forever. You won't
[09:52.840 --> 09:56.720]  see any drop in light power from a ballast from what I've noticed they'll
[09:56.720 --> 10:01.880]  just die one day it won't even warn you so when your ballast warranty is about
[10:01.880 --> 10:05.280]  to be up go get another one you guys. Alright that should be enough ranting
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.000]  for now about fixing your rooms. One thing I should remind you of that I have
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.920]  mentioned in a previous episode since we're talking about replacing things
[10:11.920 --> 10:18.640]  calibrate your pH meters you guys your TDS pins your pH pins whatever else you
[10:18.640 --> 10:22.600]  want to call it your EC meter if you're in England or Britain you guys calibrate
[10:22.600 --> 10:26.040]  those things quite frequently because when that messes up you don't even
[10:26.120 --> 10:29.160]  notice and you're just in there trying to adjust pH and you're doing it wrong
[10:29.160 --> 10:32.680]  and you don't know so you're gonna start causing problems. Alright you guys I've
[10:32.680 --> 10:36.960]  been going for just over 10 minutes here I need a quick dab so uh you know let's
[10:36.960 --> 10:41.920]  do a dab on the air together I was recently gifted some blueberry headband
[10:41.920 --> 10:47.080]  shatter from the spot it's actually the shatter is from our boys at Turpex I got
[10:47.080 --> 10:50.160]  it at the spot out in Pueblo West I'm gonna take a quick drink of this
[10:50.160 --> 10:52.920]  bubbly carbonated beverage I got here and then we're gonna put together a dab
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  and we're gonna take a dab together so here we go
[10:55.000 --> 11:04.400]  alright I needed a carbonated drink there that was much deserved I'm gonna
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.640]  get a dab together real quick you guys big shout out to something called the
[11:09.640 --> 11:14.280]  perfect jar I was gifted a jar called the perfect jar by my buddy Hunt of the
[11:14.280 --> 11:17.800]  Grimy Gatsby and they might be right this might be the perfect jar man this
[11:17.800 --> 11:21.760]  thing is nice it's uh I don't even know what kind of plastic this is it's real
[11:21.760 --> 11:25.320]  sturdy plastic it's got a nice screw on lid it's airtight it's nicely it's got
[11:25.320 --> 11:29.520]  dividers inside I'm able to carry my herb in one container I got a dabber in
[11:29.520 --> 11:32.400]  one container and then like four or five different kinds of shatter and the other
[11:32.400 --> 11:36.320]  little containers there nice container bro thanks I appreciate you kicking that
[11:36.320 --> 11:41.080]  down so today we are going to dab the what did I call it's blueberry headband
[11:41.080 --> 11:45.400]  from our friends at Turpex and I'm putting a dab of it on the dabber right
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.920]  now as we speak you guys we're dabbing out of the Eric Ross 4.0 custom prototype
[11:50.920 --> 11:53.800]  that's autographed by Eric Ross on the back it's got his little signature
[11:53.920 --> 11:59.000]  etched in the back to that it's got the highly educated D nail big shout out to
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.720]  highly educated and task rock and that D nail attachment is attached to what is
[12:03.720 --> 12:08.080]  called the g-nail coil by our friends at emotech shout out to giddy up and emo
[12:08.080 --> 12:11.400]  tech I'm burping from that drink excuse me so I've got the dab together you guys
[12:11.400 --> 12:16.500]  let's take a dab blueberry headband shatter from Turpex available at the spot
[12:16.500 --> 12:19.800]  dispensary you know by the time you hear this they'll have a totally different
[12:19.800 --> 12:22.840]  brand of shatter in or a totally different flavor but let's review this
[12:22.840 --> 12:39.670]  anyway here we go it's definitely smooth nice and smooth no choke oh I
[12:39.670 --> 12:44.870]  like that um so let me back up a step here by looking at it it's nice and
[12:44.870 --> 12:49.310]  glossy it's got a nice shine to it it's nice and clear it's got a nice clear
[12:49.310 --> 12:54.970]  amber yellow color so it looks great on the inhale well let me talk about the
[12:54.970 --> 12:57.510]  smell it just smells like hash let's smell it again let's put it up to the
[12:57.510 --> 13:01.790]  nose yeah just like shatter mostly smells the same it's got that shattery
[13:01.790 --> 13:06.910]  like almost a honey kind of a sweet smell to it but anyway it looks good it
[13:06.910 --> 13:10.710]  smells good when I taste it on the inhale I definitely tasted the blueberry
[13:10.710 --> 13:17.830]  on the exhale it had a hint of cushy chemi type of stuff an earthy flavor on
[13:17.830 --> 13:21.550]  the out so the N is blueberries and there's a hint of blueberry on the tongue
[13:21.550 --> 13:26.510]  still but you know what the feeling is straight headband it feels like I just
[13:26.510 --> 13:30.310]  put a headband on my head it feels like I just slowed down to tell you the truth
[13:30.310 --> 13:35.030]  it feels like it just slowed down a whole bunch so let's get back into doing
[13:35.030 --> 13:38.390]  a podcast I certainly approve of the blueberry headband it tastes like
[13:38.390 --> 13:42.750]  blueberry it feels like headband it's smooth I don't know how I fuck from it
[13:42.750 --> 13:46.830]  to tell you the truth guys excuse the cough all right now that I'm I a shit I
[13:46.830 --> 13:49.750]  want to answer some questions that people have sent to me these questions
[13:49.750 --> 13:53.190]  have come from periscope they've come from Twitter I've gotten them in emails
[13:53.190 --> 13:55.990]  and I have gotten them on Facebook you guys if you're not checking it out on
[13:55.990 --> 14:00.750]  periscope every occasionally I jump onto periscope and just I take a couple
[14:00.750 --> 14:04.230]  of dabs and I rant and I hang out with my friends I talk about a few things
[14:04.230 --> 14:07.350]  that are on my mind and then I just sign out and say goodbye and I usually delete
[14:07.350 --> 14:11.790]  the videos pretty quickly but if you ever check out the periscope app make
[14:11.790 --> 14:14.510]  sure you follow me and you can check out some of the videos in the future I'll do
[14:14.510 --> 14:18.750]  a full podcast on periscope and you'll be able to jump in and ask me questions
[14:18.750 --> 14:22.270]  and I'll be able to answer them live for you the only problem with that right now
[14:22.270 --> 14:25.830]  is you guys I'm taking over as the lead grower at the spot dispensary and there's
[14:25.830 --> 14:29.670]  been a lot of work and some days we work until noon other days we work until
[14:29.670 --> 14:33.310]  six it's hard to guess so right now scheduling things is a little bit of a
[14:33.310 --> 14:36.270]  pain in the ass but I promise you I'm gonna do this periscope episode I just
[14:36.270 --> 14:39.270]  promised you so that means I've got to do it I've never promised you something
[14:39.270 --> 14:42.790]  and not done it on this show all right so let me get to the point here
[14:42.790 --> 14:46.990]  questions and answers with Rasta Jeff our first question is about a product
[14:46.990 --> 14:52.790]  called OGT quite a while ago I mentioned that I use a product called OGT
[14:52.790 --> 14:56.470]  veganic secret sauce is what I think it's called and somebody asked me to
[14:56.470 --> 15:01.710]  talk a little bit about it I like that product a whole bunch I like it it's
[15:01.710 --> 15:03.990]  what it is I don't have any of the product with me I've used all of what I
[15:03.990 --> 15:07.590]  have and I kind of kind of haven't been using it since I ran out I replaced it
[15:07.590 --> 15:13.230]  with something else but what it is is an organic tea that is able to be mixed
[15:13.230 --> 15:16.390]  almost instantly and then fed to your plants a lot of teas that we're using
[15:16.390 --> 15:20.550]  need to be mixed up and they need to brew for 24 to 48 hours this stuff you
[15:20.550 --> 15:24.390]  can pour the powder into some water give it a nice stir and feed it directly
[15:24.390 --> 15:28.590]  to your plants one thing that I did notice that it promoted ridiculously
[15:28.590 --> 15:32.630]  healthy roots my roots were growing quickly my roots were growing out of the
[15:32.630 --> 15:35.790]  holes in the bottoms of my pots the drainage holes my roots were coming out
[15:35.790 --> 15:40.310]  of there looking for somewhere else to go hide I have a friend who breaks down
[15:40.310 --> 15:43.550]  the soil from my harvested plants he gets paid to help me out a little bit
[15:43.550 --> 15:47.470]  and when Mike was breaking down those root balls he asked me dude what have
[15:47.470 --> 15:51.110]  you been doing differently lately because these things are amazing a lot
[15:51.110 --> 15:56.910]  of that I will attribute to the secret sauce the OGT I think it was doing a lot
[15:56.910 --> 16:02.030]  of it it was really great for the early lifecycle of the plants and for veg now
[16:02.030 --> 16:05.630]  when in when I went into flower here's something that I didn't realize was
[16:05.630 --> 16:09.270]  happening I noticed there was something weird and somebody else pointed it out
[16:09.270 --> 16:14.310]  to me when I was in flower and I was feeding OGT I would feed it every other
[16:14.430 --> 16:19.510]  week and on those weeks I would notice that my plants would progress more into
[16:19.510 --> 16:23.830]  what looks like a nutrient deficiency on some strains I had strains that I I was
[16:23.830 --> 16:27.110]  feeding it just like I have before and it looked like it was becoming nitrogen
[16:27.110 --> 16:30.150]  deficient the plant couldn't keep up with itself and it was just burning out
[16:30.150 --> 16:35.310]  really early and I mentioned that to our friend Shawn and I mentioned that the
[16:35.310 --> 16:39.870]  only thing I was using differently was the OGT and Shawn said that the rock
[16:39.990 --> 16:45.190]  phosphates that they are using to produce the OGT speed up the nutritive
[16:45.190 --> 16:49.870]  cycle of your plant so if you're going to use this stuff I would only use it
[16:49.870 --> 16:54.350]  during the veg cycle and use it very sparingly during the flowering cycle
[16:54.350 --> 16:58.990]  because when I used the recommended dosage it sped my plants up almost too
[16:58.990 --> 17:03.670]  much and they weren't burned but they were almost not able to they were
[17:03.670 --> 17:07.590]  growing so quickly and using nutrients so quickly that they were eating all of
[17:07.790 --> 17:10.990]  their food for the week within the first couple of the days and then starving
[17:10.990 --> 17:14.630]  themselves is what it looked like was happening so that is my little rant on
[17:14.630 --> 17:18.550]  OGT it's a good product but if you're going to use it be prepared and you're
[17:18.550 --> 17:21.510]  gonna have to adjust your feeding and you're gonna have to pay attention but I
[17:21.510 --> 17:24.230]  hope you're doing that every time you put a new product into your garden
[17:24.230 --> 17:30.990]  anyway alright so our next question I want to move on where did I put it here
[17:30.990 --> 17:33.870]  we go our next question comes from Periscope and somebody asked me and this
[17:33.910 --> 17:38.510]  is gonna take me a little bit to describe here but somebody said what is
[17:38.510 --> 17:42.590]  solventless because I was talking about solventless on Periscope and they did
[17:42.590 --> 17:48.230]  not have it in context so let me try to describe to you what solventless is
[17:48.230 --> 17:57.190]  first off let me say that solventless is a marketing term solventless is owned by
[17:57.190 --> 18:01.470]  Nikita of the essential extracts I don't know if it's owned by him but it is the
[18:01.590 --> 18:08.390]  marketing term that he has put on what he calls solventless now that being said
[18:08.390 --> 18:14.830]  not all solventless hash has to come from Nikita anything any hash that is
[18:14.830 --> 18:20.230]  made without a solvent can will be considered solventless in most cases in
[18:20.230 --> 18:23.550]  99% of the cases in the cannabis industry you know I've never seen
[18:23.550 --> 18:27.670]  anything else called non-solvent maybe dry sift but that's totally different
[18:27.670 --> 18:32.510]  water hash or bubble hash is solventless it's made with ice and water
[18:32.510 --> 18:39.750]  it's not the solvents that we are using is BHO pH oh there are a couple other
[18:39.750 --> 18:43.870]  gases that people are using to extract hash with lately but the propane and the
[18:43.870 --> 18:47.710]  butane are the solvents and I know a lot of people are gonna say but water is a
[18:47.710 --> 18:53.070]  solvent as well right in this case and I'm going to paraphrase what Nikita says
[18:53.070 --> 18:56.830]  all of the time a big shout out to DJ Nikita when we're talking about
[18:56.830 --> 19:00.670]  solventless hash water is not being used as a solvent it's being used as a
[19:00.670 --> 19:04.270]  mechanical separator we're not trying to dissolve the trichomes we're not trying
[19:04.270 --> 19:08.430]  to dissolve the plant matter we're just simply using it as a way to wash the
[19:08.430 --> 19:13.150]  trichomes off of the leaves so solventless hash is basically hash made
[19:13.150 --> 19:19.630]  by using ice or water solventless made by DJ Nikita is kept at a certain
[19:19.630 --> 19:23.870]  temperature at all times and it never gets warm it never gets dry it never
[19:23.990 --> 19:28.150]  hardens up and it's always got a nice greasy texture to it it's always real
[19:28.150 --> 19:31.830]  tasty that's solventless alright so since we're talking about solventless
[19:31.830 --> 19:35.110]  let me describe a couple of other types of hash just to kind of put that in
[19:35.110 --> 19:38.870]  perspective a little bit other types of hash that are super popular right now
[19:38.870 --> 19:44.870]  that everybody talks about our BHO which is butane honey oil or butane hash or
[19:44.870 --> 19:49.870]  dabs or shatter or wax that's pretty much the most popular right now and then
[19:49.870 --> 19:56.790]  of course there is live resin live resin is basically it is BHO that is
[19:56.790 --> 20:00.870]  made from fresh frozen plants and then it is blasted through an obidos machine
[20:00.870 --> 20:05.110]  by emotech the only way that you can make live resin is through an emotech
[20:05.110 --> 20:09.630]  machine and I know that sounds crazy but like I said earlier Nikita has made the
[20:09.630 --> 20:14.270]  marketing term solventless the boys at emotech have come up with the term live
[20:14.270 --> 20:19.110]  resin so unless you're running it emotech style in an emotech machine
[20:19.110 --> 20:22.750]  you're not making live resin a lot of people are gonna hate on me for that but
[20:22.750 --> 20:26.790]  that is my theory and I'm sticking to it alright you guys I've got time for one
[20:26.790 --> 20:29.710]  more question this question comes from Facebook and it's from our friend Bobby
[20:29.710 --> 20:34.910]  Bobby is starting his first grow and he's asking if it is okay to use miracle
[20:34.910 --> 20:40.590]  grow plant food or miracle grow soil for his cannabis plants and you guys I
[20:40.590 --> 20:44.830]  definitely have to say I strongly recommend not using any miracle girl
[20:44.830 --> 20:51.750]  products in your garden the miracle grow soil has time-released fertilizers
[20:51.750 --> 20:56.550]  in it which will last for up to six months and you don't want nitrogen being
[20:56.550 --> 21:00.710]  released into your plants for six months so I would recommend not using that soil
[21:00.710 --> 21:05.710]  use something like a Fox Farms product or a roots organics product use
[21:05.710 --> 21:08.310]  something like that if you're a new grower it gives you a solid start
[21:08.310 --> 21:12.590]  there's not nutrients in it that are gonna screw you up it'll have things in
[21:12.590 --> 21:17.430]  it that will help you out from the very beginning as for the nutrients if you
[21:17.430 --> 21:21.030]  are trying to use miracle grow nutrients I would throw those away right away get
[21:21.030 --> 21:24.070]  rid of the plant food head of your hydro shop head to hydro indoor growing
[21:24.070 --> 21:28.430]  supplies and get yourself a basic two or three part nutrient solution there will
[21:28.430 --> 21:32.950]  be a bottle a a bottle B of a brand that sounds good to you the guys at the
[21:32.950 --> 21:35.390]  hydro shop can definitely talk you through what you need they'll help you
[21:35.390 --> 21:39.590]  pick a brand they're mainly if you're just starting out they're mainly the
[21:39.590 --> 21:43.630]  same thing I would say go with something like botanic hair biobiz
[21:43.630 --> 21:48.670]  something simple just something with an A and a B the general organics or
[21:48.670 --> 21:52.670]  general hydroponics flora nova stuff that's all fine any of that stuff you
[21:52.670 --> 21:55.630]  want to go for it's pretty much all the same thing if you're starting out get
[21:55.630 --> 21:59.630]  yourself an A and a B maybe a bloom booster and then maybe like some sugary
[21:59.630 --> 22:03.070]  or something to sweeten it up but definitely get away from that miracle
[22:03.070 --> 22:07.230]  grow stuff go to the hydro shop get something designed more toward cannabis
[22:07.230 --> 22:11.830]  something that you can control for each cycle of your plants because you're not
[22:11.830 --> 22:15.430]  gonna want the same nutrients from beginning to end you want a little bit
[22:15.430 --> 22:18.830]  of grow in the beginning and you're gonna taper the grow off as you get into
[22:18.830 --> 22:22.750]  flower and you'll start using the bloom solution so go get something that's more
[22:22.750 --> 22:27.310]  designed for the plants that you are growing Bobby I hope that helps you out
[22:27.310 --> 22:30.350]  you guys that are thinking about miracle grow soil I hope I got you away from
[22:30.350 --> 22:34.790]  that also here's something to think about you guys miracle grow products are
[22:35.350 --> 22:40.390]  from Scotts and Scotts is a Monsanto brand and we do not want to support
[22:40.390 --> 22:44.710]  Monsanto because Monsanto does not support the world so that's something to
[22:44.710 --> 22:47.750]  think about think about where the products you're buying are made and who
[22:47.750 --> 22:52.830]  they affect and the impact that you will have on the world all right you guys I
[22:52.830 --> 22:55.390]  think that was enough questions for one episode I really want to thank everybody
[22:55.390 --> 22:59.190]  who sent me questions if you want to send questions to me via email if you
