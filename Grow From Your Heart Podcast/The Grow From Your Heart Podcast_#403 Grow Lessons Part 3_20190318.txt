[00:03.900 --> 00:31.030]  Welcome back, Podcast World!
[00:31.030 --> 00:36.110]  It's time for Episode 403 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:36.110 --> 00:39.150]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:39.150 --> 00:43.630]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can find
[00:43.630 --> 00:49.070]  them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:49.070 --> 00:52.310]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:52.310 --> 00:57.190]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Pineapple Fanta Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:57.190 --> 01:01.110]  This is a combination of golden pineapple and Jet Fuel Gelato.
[01:01.110 --> 01:05.510]  On the label, it is described as tasting like citrus cleaner, haze, and fruit chews.
[01:05.510 --> 01:10.030]  I would agree with that, but I would also say it tastes just like a pineapple Fanta.
[01:10.030 --> 01:14.950]  It's got that sweet pineapple citrus flavor, and it even has a fizzy flavor to it.
[01:14.950 --> 01:17.950]  It may sound crazy, but when you dab it, you will agree with me.
[01:17.950 --> 01:23.870]  So, big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Pineapple Fanta.
[01:23.870 --> 01:27.910]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode is going to be another compilation of reposted grow
[01:27.910 --> 01:29.070]  lessons.
[01:29.070 --> 01:39.870]  In this episode, I'm going to repost episodes 368, 369, 370, 372, 374, and 376.
[01:39.870 --> 01:44.670]  Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's jump right in to episode 403 of the
[01:44.670 --> 01:53.660]  Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:53.660 --> 01:54.820]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[01:54.820 --> 01:58.620]  It's time for episode 368 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:58.620 --> 02:01.740]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:01.740 --> 02:06.220]  If you need fresh genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[02:06.220 --> 02:11.940]  and you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[02:11.940 --> 02:15.260]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I am smoking on.
[02:15.260 --> 02:20.260]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Screamin' Watermelon from our friends at Viola Extracts.
[02:20.260 --> 02:21.900]  This stuff has a really nice flavor.
[02:21.900 --> 02:25.340]  If you dab it too hot, you totally kill that sweet watermelon flavor.
[02:25.340 --> 02:29.900]  If you go in nice and cool, it has a sweet watermelon Jolly Rancher sort of flavor, and
[02:29.900 --> 02:31.220]  I really like it.
[02:31.220 --> 02:42.620]  The label here says it is 94.5% THC-A and 0% CBD or CBG for a total of 82.88% THC.
[02:42.620 --> 02:45.820]  That's a pretty impressive lab test for something with so much flavor.
[02:45.820 --> 02:49.780]  Big shout out to the Screamin' Watermelon from Viola Extracts, and also big shout out
[02:49.780 --> 02:54.100]  to my friends at the Colorado Cannabis Exchange for taking good care of me.
[02:54.100 --> 02:57.980]  All right, before I take us into the grow lesson, I want to give you guys an update
[02:57.980 --> 02:59.100]  on my web store.
[02:59.100 --> 03:01.740]  I have added some new merchandise to my website.
[03:01.740 --> 03:06.140]  There are new IRE Army t-shirts, there are IRE Genetics t-shirts, there are Grow From
[03:06.140 --> 03:10.380]  Your Heart podcast t-shirts, there are IRE Genetics hoodies, and there are Grow From
[03:10.380 --> 03:16.900]  Your Heart podcast hoodies all available on the website, plus a plethora of great stickers.
[03:16.900 --> 03:20.500]  Make sure you check out the website, IREGeneticsColorado.com.
[03:20.500 --> 03:24.180]  Grab yourself some shirts, grab yourself some stickers, get a hoodie for the winter, get
[03:24.180 --> 03:27.700]  yourself all styled out with the fresh new IRE Genetics gear.
[03:27.940 --> 03:29.980]  All right, you guys, let's work on a podcast.
[03:29.980 --> 03:32.620]  This is going to be another grow lesson.
[03:32.620 --> 03:36.180]  I hope you have been following along with my long series of grow lessons.
[03:36.180 --> 03:38.860]  We started off by selecting a goal for our grow.
[03:38.860 --> 03:40.740]  We worked on selecting a proper space.
[03:40.740 --> 03:42.260]  We built a good grow room.
[03:42.260 --> 03:44.940]  We decided if we wanted to grow from seeds or clones.
[03:44.940 --> 03:46.720]  We acquired seeds and clones.
[03:46.720 --> 03:48.300]  We have got them sprouted.
[03:48.300 --> 03:50.820]  Now they are potted into their little pots.
[03:50.820 --> 03:55.380]  I think by this time, all of our seeds and clones should be about the same size.
[03:55.380 --> 03:59.140]  We have got stuff in either a four-inch pot or a six-inch net pot.
[03:59.140 --> 04:02.220]  We should have clones or seedlings with just a few sets of leaves.
[04:02.220 --> 04:05.300]  They're probably four, maybe six inches tall by now.
[04:05.300 --> 04:08.020]  That is what I call small veg.
[04:08.020 --> 04:13.800]  Let's do a podcast about the small vegetative phase of growing your cannabis garden.
[04:13.800 --> 04:19.140]  In my opinion, the vegetative phase of growing cannabis is often the most overlooked phase
[04:19.140 --> 04:20.260]  of growing.
[04:20.260 --> 04:24.960]  People think they need to invest all of their time, energy, and money on the flowering process.
[04:25.540 --> 04:26.540]  That is very important.
[04:26.540 --> 04:31.600]  But I like to believe that you can't build a strong building without a solid foundation.
[04:31.600 --> 04:35.320]  That foundation starts in the veg phase.
[04:35.320 --> 04:39.080]  By the time we get these plants to the flowering room, we need them to be healthy.
[04:39.080 --> 04:40.500]  We need them to be robust.
[04:40.500 --> 04:41.980]  We need them the shape we want them.
[04:41.980 --> 04:43.940]  We need them the structure we want them.
[04:43.940 --> 04:46.560]  We need them pest and pathogen-free.
[04:46.560 --> 04:52.020]  My main focus during the small vegetative stage is to develop a strong root system for
[04:52.020 --> 04:53.020]  these plants.
[04:53.020 --> 04:56.980]  I want to get those roots thick and busting out of that pot before I transplant them into
[04:56.980 --> 04:58.580]  their forever homes.
[04:58.580 --> 05:02.940]  My second goal is to keep these plants pest and pathogen-free.
[05:02.940 --> 05:08.580]  If I'm working from seeds, I'm also paying attention for issues, mutations, problems,
[05:08.580 --> 05:09.900]  whatever a seedling may show you.
[05:09.900 --> 05:14.100]  A seedling has a ton of options that can occur through the entire growth cycle.
[05:14.100 --> 05:16.540]  You need to pay special attention to your seedlings.
[05:16.540 --> 05:20.140]  If you're growing from clones, you should know what to expect.
[05:20.140 --> 05:25.160]  My main focus during the small vegetative phase is developing a strong root system.
[05:25.160 --> 05:28.500]  My second priority is maintaining clean, healthy plants.
[05:28.500 --> 05:31.180]  I don't want any bugs and I don't need any pathogens.
[05:31.180 --> 05:35.540]  Then my third priority, if I'm growing from seeds, I want to pay close attention to those
[05:35.540 --> 05:40.500]  seedlings and I want to keep my eye out for any weird mutations or weird problems.
[05:40.500 --> 05:44.860]  Now if things go right, we are only going to spend two to four weeks in these small
[05:44.860 --> 05:47.020]  pots in our small veg phase.
[05:47.100 --> 05:52.260]  In my opinion, this phase is equally as important as the flowering process.
[05:52.260 --> 05:56.940]  We need to treat every step of the grow process as an important process.
[05:56.940 --> 05:59.280]  We all want to focus on that flowering phase.
[05:59.280 --> 06:01.420]  We all get excited around week four.
[06:01.420 --> 06:03.380]  We get super pumped up at week five.
[06:03.380 --> 06:05.540]  By week six, you're just ecstatic.
[06:05.540 --> 06:07.900]  Week seven and eight, you can't wait to cut it down.
[06:07.900 --> 06:11.420]  By week nine, you're in there every single day taking pictures, looking at the plants,
[06:11.420 --> 06:14.900]  hoping you can cut them down today or tomorrow, just trying to be patient.
[06:14.900 --> 06:18.540]  Why don't we put that much energy into the starting phase of our plants?
[06:18.540 --> 06:19.860]  I know they're not as pretty.
[06:19.860 --> 06:22.860]  There's nothing to show for it, but it is just as important.
[06:22.860 --> 06:26.780]  Now let's get a little deeper into this small veg phase.
[06:26.780 --> 06:28.260]  What makes this small veg?
[06:28.260 --> 06:30.580]  What makes it small veg is my plants are small.
[06:30.580 --> 06:31.820]  They are in small pots.
[06:31.820 --> 06:33.420]  Now what makes it veg?
[06:33.420 --> 06:36.020]  Veg is the light cycle.
[06:36.020 --> 06:38.580]  Cannabis plants are triggered by the light cycle.
[06:38.580 --> 06:40.780]  If they have enough light, they will not flower.
[06:40.780 --> 06:45.020]  Once we reduce the light to approximately 12 hours on and 12 hours off every day, that
[06:45.020 --> 06:46.700]  triggers our plants to flower.
[06:46.700 --> 06:48.140]  They think that the fall is coming.
[06:48.140 --> 06:49.740]  They think it's the end of the season.
[06:49.740 --> 06:53.580]  They start doing their end of season business, which is producing flowers.
[06:53.580 --> 06:56.260]  The parts that we call buds are the cannabis flowers.
[06:56.260 --> 06:59.300]  They are dried flower tops from a cannabis plant.
[06:59.300 --> 07:02.540]  That is induced by changing the light cycle.
[07:02.540 --> 07:06.100]  Until we manipulate that light cycle, we are in veg.
[07:06.100 --> 07:10.980]  Since we are using small pots and have small plants, once again, we are back to small.
[07:10.980 --> 07:13.500]  Now let's talk a little bit about these light cycles.
[07:13.500 --> 07:18.660]  We've got plenty of options for light cycles in our veg phase.
[07:18.660 --> 07:24.860]  From what I have experienced, the most common and most popular veg light schedule is 18
[07:24.860 --> 07:29.640]  hours on and 16 hours off in a daily 24-hour cycle.
[07:29.640 --> 07:31.020]  There are other options.
[07:31.020 --> 07:34.780]  You can go 24 hours on and zero hours off.
[07:34.780 --> 07:37.740]  I have seen great success with two hours of darkness.
[07:37.740 --> 07:41.020]  So that's 22 hours on and two hours off every day.
[07:41.020 --> 07:45.780]  In a commercial facility, in a mother room, and in a veg room, I am known to do 20 hours
[07:45.780 --> 07:48.340]  on and four hours off.
[07:48.340 --> 07:50.020]  Now I mentioned the 18-6.
[07:50.020 --> 07:51.380]  That is kind of a classic.
[07:51.380 --> 07:53.340]  That's really close to what nature does.
[07:53.340 --> 07:56.980]  Also, there is the 16 on and eight hours off.
[07:56.980 --> 07:58.660]  All of these have their advantages.
[07:58.660 --> 08:01.740]  Also, they all have their disadvantage.
[08:01.740 --> 08:05.260]  What is the advantage of 24 hours and zero hours of darkness?
[08:05.260 --> 08:10.420]  24 hours of light means your plants are getting 24 hours of light energy.
[08:10.420 --> 08:17.860]  I usually recommend a 24-hour on cycle only for clones and tiny plants or if you're revegging.
[08:17.860 --> 08:20.940]  Sometimes we have mother plants that if they get root bound or if they don't get enough
[08:20.940 --> 08:25.740]  light or if they don't get the proper energy, they will decide to auto flower on you over
[08:25.740 --> 08:26.740]  time.
[08:26.740 --> 08:29.180]  I like to keep those plants under 24 hours of light.
[08:29.180 --> 08:33.060]  That does prevent them from flipping themselves into flower because of another environmental
[08:33.060 --> 08:34.660]  factor.
[08:34.660 --> 08:38.380]  Most of the time, I would not recommend a 24-hour light cycle unless you are cutting
[08:38.380 --> 08:43.040]  clones or you're trying to reveg or perhaps you've got a mother plant that gets temperamental
[08:43.040 --> 08:45.620]  and wants to try to auto flower on you.
[08:45.620 --> 08:49.620]  I like the 20 on and four off for a commercial environment.
[08:49.620 --> 08:51.100]  I like a little bit of dark cycle.
[08:51.100 --> 08:54.700]  I think every living thing likes a little bit of dark cycle.
[08:54.700 --> 08:56.540]  I think roots develop in the dark.
[08:56.540 --> 08:58.420]  I think the plants like a little rest.
[08:58.660 --> 09:03.100]  Also, that is four hours of electricity not being sucked up.
[09:03.100 --> 09:05.620]  If you've got one light, you're saving a little bit of money.
[09:05.620 --> 09:08.900]  If you've got 50 lights, you are saving a lot of money.
[09:08.900 --> 09:11.900]  That is 200 light hours that you are not running right there.
[09:11.900 --> 09:16.900]  That's 200,000 watt light hours that you don't have to pay for if you've got a larger facility.
[09:16.900 --> 09:21.420]  20 hours on, four hours off is always great for a commercial facility.
[09:21.420 --> 09:23.120]  You can keep your mother plants in that room.
[09:23.120 --> 09:24.680]  You can keep your small veg in that room.
[09:24.680 --> 09:27.060]  You can keep your large veg in that room.
[09:27.060 --> 09:31.220]  Usually I put the clones in that same room underneath the T5 light in the corner.
[09:31.220 --> 09:32.500]  There's just a little bit of light in the room.
[09:32.500 --> 09:34.260]  It doesn't really bother the rest of the plants.
[09:34.260 --> 09:35.260]  They're able to do their thing.
[09:35.260 --> 09:38.100]  That T5 doesn't do much in a giant veg room in a commercial facility.
[09:38.100 --> 09:42.260]  Now, I always like to mention the downside of what I'm talking about.
[09:42.260 --> 09:46.660]  There's not much of a downside to a 20 on and four off cycle.
[09:46.660 --> 09:49.820]  I guess really the only downside is that you are always running lights.
[09:49.820 --> 09:55.420]  You only get four hours of darkness compared to my next method, which is an 18 on and six
[09:55.420 --> 09:57.700]  hour off everyday cycle.
[09:57.700 --> 10:02.740]  A lot of growers prefer this because it is closer to the natural cycles of life.
[10:02.740 --> 10:05.540]  It is closer to the natural rhythms of the sun outside.
[10:05.540 --> 10:09.440]  It's a little closer to the natural circadian rhythm that our plants would be subject to
[10:09.440 --> 10:11.140]  in their normal environment.
[10:11.140 --> 10:13.980]  It just feels a little more natural in general.
[10:13.980 --> 10:19.620]  The pros to an 18 six cycle is it feels pretty natural to you and the plants.
[10:19.620 --> 10:23.700]  It also saves you quite a bit of electricity having a six hour night cycle.
[10:23.700 --> 10:26.220]  That is six hours that you don't have your lights on.
[10:26.220 --> 10:29.780]  That's six hours you don't have to cool the room as much.
[10:29.780 --> 10:34.020]  Multiply that by however many lights you've got and you start saving more and more money.
[10:34.020 --> 10:37.780]  I also think the plants really enjoy a nice six hour nap.
[10:37.780 --> 10:41.820]  You can see a lot of productivity from that six hour nap that the plants get.
[10:41.820 --> 10:48.940]  Now, our next option is a 16 and eight cycle that is very similar to the 18 six, but some
[10:48.940 --> 10:51.900]  plants will show you some differences.
[10:51.900 --> 10:56.820]  Some plants may try to flower under that 16 eight cycle if they get root bound, if
[10:56.820 --> 11:01.900]  they become nutrient deficient, if there are any environmental factors that stress those
[11:01.900 --> 11:07.540]  plants, they may decide to flower on you underneath that 16 and eight light cycle.
[11:07.540 --> 11:11.900]  Depending on what part of the globe your plants originate from, they may have a different
[11:11.900 --> 11:12.900]  critical period.
[11:12.900 --> 11:15.220]  Let me explain the critical period.
[11:15.220 --> 11:21.060]  The critical period is the amount of dark hours a plant needs to induce its flowering
[11:21.220 --> 11:22.220]  cycle.
[11:22.220 --> 11:26.340]  Some plants will flower with a 14 hour dark cycle.
[11:26.340 --> 11:29.180]  Some plants will flower with a 10 hour dark cycle.
[11:29.180 --> 11:32.960]  The reason we go for that 12 on 12 off is it's right in the middle and it seems to work
[11:32.960 --> 11:36.940]  well with most of the plants that we have bred for our indoor environment.
[11:36.940 --> 11:41.380]  Now, since some plants come from north of the equator and some plants come from south
[11:41.380 --> 11:44.580]  of the equator, we do have different flowering times.
[11:44.580 --> 11:48.280]  In tropical areas, those plants can flower for much longer because they're not going
[11:48.280 --> 11:49.780]  to get snowed on.
[11:49.780 --> 11:53.980]  So in those areas, we don't get as drastic of a day and night cycle change.
[11:53.980 --> 11:58.780]  There may be as much as one hour difference between your summer and your winter day period.
[11:58.780 --> 12:05.200]  In other areas, we get winter, we get snow, we get dumped on, and we get long dark periods.
[12:05.200 --> 12:09.900]  So our plants have evolved and adapted and climatized themselves to those regions.
[12:09.900 --> 12:14.140]  Then we have bred with those plants and we've created hybrids and brought them indoors.
[12:14.140 --> 12:18.220]  Indoors, some of our plants will flower with a 10 hour dark period.
[12:18.220 --> 12:22.180]  Indoors, some of our plants will flower with a 12 hour dark period.
[12:22.180 --> 12:26.340]  We have established that 12 on and 12 off seems to work really well for most of the
[12:26.340 --> 12:27.740]  plants that we have bred.
[12:27.740 --> 12:32.460]  Now, to prevent them from flowering early, we like to use an extended light cycle.
[12:32.460 --> 12:35.200]  That's where we put them on 16 hours on at a minimum.
[12:35.200 --> 12:37.260]  That way we know they're not going to flower.
[12:37.260 --> 12:42.380]  I like to go that 18 hours because why not give them two more full hours of energy every
[12:42.380 --> 12:43.380]  day?
[12:43.380 --> 12:46.140]  Light is the number one desired nutrient from our plants.
[12:46.140 --> 12:49.660]  Light is the number one desired factor for growth from our plants.
[12:49.660 --> 12:51.700]  So why not give it that extra two hours?
[12:51.700 --> 12:56.240]  Now in my mind, I say, why not give it that full 20 hours every day so that we can get
[12:56.240 --> 12:59.840]  maximum growth and give our plants a four hour nap every day?
[12:59.840 --> 13:01.740]  I think it works really well.
[13:01.740 --> 13:07.700]  Now another reason I like the 20 on and four off is I find that when I move my plants into
[13:07.700 --> 13:13.380]  the flowering room and I take them from a 20 hour day to a 12 hour day, they induce
[13:13.380 --> 13:15.860]  flowering very quickly.
[13:15.860 --> 13:19.580]  In other facilities where I'm running shorter veg periods, I noticed they take a little
[13:19.580 --> 13:22.580]  longer for the plants to start popping up bud set.
[13:22.580 --> 13:27.100]  The little pre-flowers, the little pistils don't start popping up as early as if I were
[13:27.100 --> 13:31.900]  to run those plants on a long day cycle and then kick that 12, 12 right away.
[13:31.900 --> 13:34.660]  I feel like the plants go, oh shit, it is time to flower.
[13:34.660 --> 13:37.160]  We have really had a reduction in daylight.
[13:37.160 --> 13:38.180]  They know it.
[13:38.180 --> 13:43.140]  So that's why I do 20 on and four off in my veg and mom area.
[13:43.140 --> 13:49.300]  Of course, I'm running, sometimes I've got 50 or 75 different cultivars in a mom room.
[13:49.300 --> 13:51.340]  So I've really got to keep things happy.
[13:51.340 --> 13:55.580]  I found that the 20 on and four off prevents anything from auto flowering.
[13:55.580 --> 14:00.640]  And again, it really triggers that flowering when I put them into the 12, 12 room.
[14:00.640 --> 14:03.940]  So those are the basic veg schedules I would recommend.
[14:03.940 --> 14:07.700]  24, 20 and four, 18 and six, or 16 and eight.
[14:07.700 --> 14:09.380]  I wouldn't go much lower than that.
[14:09.380 --> 14:11.040]  You may notice problems.
[14:11.040 --> 14:14.200]  You won't have the desired robust vegetative growth that you need.
[14:14.200 --> 14:17.880]  And also you may get plants that decide to flower before you're ready.
[14:17.880 --> 14:18.880]  All right.
[14:18.880 --> 14:21.000]  I feel like we know how long to leave the light on.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.280]  Now let's talk about what kind of light to put these plants under.
[14:25.280 --> 14:28.680]  We don't have to throw these small plants under the Gavita lights right away.
[14:28.680 --> 14:29.720]  We may crisp them up.
[14:29.720 --> 14:30.720]  We may roast them.
[14:30.720 --> 14:32.140]  They may not be prepared for that.
[14:32.140 --> 14:36.160]  So I like to start my small plants under smaller lights.
[14:36.160 --> 14:40.320]  In most situations, I think a T5 would work for most people.
[14:40.360 --> 14:44.840]  In most commercial environments, I use the three foot long T5 fixtures.
[14:44.840 --> 14:45.840]  They're three feet long.
[14:45.840 --> 14:46.880]  They have eight bulbs.
[14:46.880 --> 14:50.880]  I feel like you can fit quite a few small veg plants under those.
[14:50.880 --> 14:55.320]  In a commercial environment, I like to set up a two tiered veg system.
[14:55.320 --> 14:56.680]  I get a Uline rack.
[14:56.680 --> 14:59.640]  I put plants on the bottom shelf of that Uline rack.
[14:59.640 --> 15:03.720]  I hang a light underneath the top shelf to light those plants.
[15:03.720 --> 15:05.360]  Now I've got that top shelf freed up.
[15:05.360 --> 15:08.560]  I put plants up there and I hang a light from the ceiling.
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.880]  Now I've got two layers of plants and I'm maximizing my space by using a two tiered
[15:13.880 --> 15:15.740]  veg system.
[15:15.740 --> 15:19.000]  I like to use a T5 fixture for the plants on the bottom shelf.
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.520]  And then for the plants on the top shelf, I either use a Gavita or a metal halide, either
[15:23.520 --> 15:27.440]  somewhere between a four and a thousand watt, depending on my space, depending on my environment,
[15:27.440 --> 15:29.840]  depending on how far from those plants I am.
[15:29.840 --> 15:33.960]  But those small veg plants start off on the bottom shelf under the T5s.
[15:33.960 --> 15:37.120]  Then as I transplant, I move them up to the top shelf and they go underneath the metal
[15:37.120 --> 15:38.120]  halides.
[15:38.120 --> 15:39.480]  Sometimes those are Gavitas.
[15:39.480 --> 15:41.880]  It just depends again on my environment.
[15:41.880 --> 15:44.240]  Now I really find the T5s to be cost effective.
[15:44.240 --> 15:47.120]  I think they're efficient and I think they do a great job.
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.400]  If you want to invest a little more money on a better light, I have seen great success
[15:52.400 --> 15:55.480]  vegging underneath LED lighting.
[15:55.480 --> 15:58.380]  Small plants really love LED lights.
[15:58.380 --> 16:02.940]  And also those LEDs don't produce much heat and they don't use a lot of electricity.
[16:02.940 --> 16:07.620]  They are a little pricey upfront, but I think they are worth the money if you get a quality
[16:08.120 --> 16:09.120]  LED.
[16:09.120 --> 16:14.140]  I personally don't have much experience with LED lighting, but I have seen great things
[16:14.140 --> 16:18.940]  from LED lights in small veg, in large veg, and through flower.
[16:18.940 --> 16:22.540]  The most important thing about an LED in veg is the spectrum.
[16:22.540 --> 16:24.740]  And that's also important when it comes to T5s.
[16:24.740 --> 16:27.940]  Let me back up because I overlooked that part when I was talking about T5s.
[16:27.940 --> 16:29.400]  I do not have any notes on this.
[16:29.400 --> 16:31.540]  This is all coming out of the top of my head today.
[16:31.540 --> 16:33.940]  So let me catch myself before I go too fast.
[16:33.940 --> 16:37.300]  T5 lights are commonly available in two spectrums.
[16:37.300 --> 16:42.060]  Most of the time you will find them in a 3000 Kelvin and a 6400 Kelvin.
[16:42.060 --> 16:45.820]  For your veg phase, I recommend the 6400 Kelvin.
[16:45.820 --> 16:50.140]  They will put off a more blue light, which is what we want for the veg.
[16:50.140 --> 16:53.340]  Later on when we move to flower, we want more of that orange spectrum.
[16:53.340 --> 16:58.580]  So that's when you would switch to the 3000 Kelvin T5 bulbs if you were going to flower
[16:58.580 --> 17:01.660]  under them, which I do not recommend, but they are great for veg.
[17:02.380 --> 17:05.020]  Spectrum is very important and I almost overlooked that.
[17:05.020 --> 17:11.620]  When you were selecting your T5 bulbs, make sure that you get the 6400 Kelvin bulbs.
[17:11.620 --> 17:14.460]  Those are what I would recommend for your veg phase.
[17:14.460 --> 17:19.060]  I also recommend the bluer or whiter spectrum lights when it comes to LEDs.
[17:19.060 --> 17:23.620]  A lot of the new LEDs give you the option to turn on certain boards and turn off certain
[17:23.620 --> 17:24.620]  boards.
[17:24.620 --> 17:27.500]  When you are vegging, you want more of the blue and whiter spectrums.
[17:27.740 --> 17:32.420]  Again, once we turn to flower, that's when we want those orange and red spectrums.
[17:32.420 --> 17:36.940]  So while we're in veg, whatever kind of light you're using, focus more on the white or blue
[17:36.940 --> 17:38.700]  spectrums.
[17:38.700 --> 17:42.660]  So I've got another option for lighting that I can recommend, but I would only suggest
[17:42.660 --> 17:47.180]  this for a very small scale grow environment.
[17:47.180 --> 17:51.380]  Maybe for one or two very small plants, maybe for a cabinet grow or something, this would
[17:51.380 --> 17:54.460]  be an effective grow light in a pinch.
[17:54.460 --> 17:59.660]  I have seen a lot of folks build a small grow cabinet with a compact fluorescent light.
[17:59.660 --> 18:05.060]  Those CFLs, they put off barely any heat and they use barely any electricity.
[18:05.060 --> 18:08.260]  So if you can get enough of them around your plant to feel like you're giving it enough
[18:08.260 --> 18:10.180]  light, the plant will grow.
[18:10.180 --> 18:14.820]  Don't expect huge growth, don't expect robust plants, don't expect a large harvest, but
[18:14.820 --> 18:18.980]  you can make a plant grow with a compact fluorescent light.
[18:18.980 --> 18:23.500]  Of course, the more light, the better, but some people are very limited in space and
[18:23.500 --> 18:27.820]  power and some people only want a small grow for a small personal experiment.
[18:27.820 --> 18:30.840]  So a compact fluorescent light may work for you.
[18:30.840 --> 18:34.180]  That would always be my very last option.
[18:34.180 --> 18:36.260]  Now let's talk about a big boy light.
[18:36.260 --> 18:41.060]  A lot of people are familiar with growing under high intensity discharge lighting.
[18:41.060 --> 18:44.780]  A lot of people are going to flower under an HID light.
[18:44.780 --> 18:50.020]  If we are careful to not roast the plants, a metal halide light will be perfect for your
[18:50.020 --> 18:51.780]  small veg plants.
[18:51.780 --> 18:57.300]  Maybe a 400, maybe a 600, a thousand may be overkill unless you keep it a little distance
[18:57.300 --> 18:58.300]  away.
[18:58.300 --> 19:03.260]  You can get a 400 watt light fairly close to your small plants if you keep it cool.
[19:03.260 --> 19:06.660]  If you've got a ducted hood and you're keeping air moving over that light to where none of
[19:06.660 --> 19:11.540]  that heat is making it to your canopy, you can get that 400 watt light fairly close to
[19:11.540 --> 19:12.540]  your plants.
[19:12.540 --> 19:16.060]  Just don't let that heat roast your plants and dehydrate your soil.
[19:16.060 --> 19:20.980]  I would say maybe keep a 400 watt light 18 to 24 inches away from your small plants.
[19:20.980 --> 19:25.260]  The T5s, you can get those T5s six to eight inches away from the plants.
[19:25.260 --> 19:28.540]  The bigger the light, we need to go a little further because it's going to be hotter and
[19:28.540 --> 19:32.980]  more intense and you don't want to have super hot, intense light right in your face all
[19:32.980 --> 19:33.980]  day.
[19:33.980 --> 19:36.660]  You survive from the sun and you're happy with it being real far away.
[19:36.660 --> 19:40.540]  Think about the plants and the light and the sun and yourself having a similar kind of
[19:40.540 --> 19:41.540]  a relationship.
[19:41.540 --> 19:42.620]  You need plenty of it.
[19:42.620 --> 19:46.300]  You don't want anything in the way, but also you don't want to get barbecued.
[19:46.300 --> 19:52.660]  You can put a 400 watt light 18, 24 inches away, a 600, I would probably go 20, 30 inches
[19:52.660 --> 19:54.460]  away, a thousand watt light.
[19:54.460 --> 19:56.980]  You're going to want to be a few feet away from those small plants.
[19:56.980 --> 19:57.980]  It's going to get hot.
[19:57.980 --> 20:00.020]  It's going to be very intense.
[20:00.020 --> 20:04.780]  If you've got a 400 watt light and it's ducted, which means it's got a duct coming off of
[20:04.780 --> 20:08.340]  each end and you're sucking air through it to move that heat away from that bulb and
[20:08.340 --> 20:12.540]  you've got glass between the bulb and the canopy, you should be able to run a 400 watt
[20:12.540 --> 20:17.740]  light with very minimal problems if you pay attention to heat and the distance from those
[20:17.740 --> 20:18.740]  plants.
[20:18.740 --> 20:23.980]  All right, I think that pretty much covers our lighting options for our small veg plants.
[20:23.980 --> 20:26.100]  Let's talk a little bit about the environment.
[20:26.100 --> 20:30.240]  Let's talk about the temperature and humidity for these small plants.
[20:30.240 --> 20:35.260]  In my experience, my small plants appear to be happiest when they are somewhere between
[20:35.260 --> 20:37.660]  70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
[20:37.980 --> 20:44.460]  I really think they like it about 75 degrees to 77 degrees is right about the prime spot
[20:44.460 --> 20:45.860]  for small veg plants.
[20:45.860 --> 20:47.460]  That's when I see the most growth.
[20:47.460 --> 20:49.140]  That's when I see the most production.
[20:49.140 --> 20:51.100]  That's when I see the most root development.
[20:51.100 --> 20:54.020]  That's when I see the happiest plants.
[20:54.020 --> 20:59.660]  Somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees, or if you can dial it in perfectly, 75 to 77 is
[20:59.660 --> 21:00.660]  that sweet spot.
[21:00.660 --> 21:02.580]  They really seem to like it right there.
[21:02.580 --> 21:07.100]  Now, for that temperature to work perfectly, you need to dial in your humidity.
[21:07.540 --> 21:08.820]  Temperature and humidity work together.
[21:08.820 --> 21:09.820]  There is a math equation.
[21:09.820 --> 21:11.540]  I've done a full episode on it.
[21:11.540 --> 21:14.620]  This creates what is called a vapor pressure deficit.
[21:14.620 --> 21:19.540]  I encourage you to listen to episode 314 and learn about vapor pressure deficit.
[21:19.540 --> 21:21.620]  But now let's talk about humidity.
[21:21.620 --> 21:26.260]  These small plants would like to be in an environment with the humidity somewhere between
[21:26.260 --> 21:29.060]  50 and 70%.
[21:29.060 --> 21:33.620]  I have noticed that when the humidity is too low, the plants do not produce.
[21:33.620 --> 21:37.500]  There is no production for the whole day when the humidity is too low.
[21:37.500 --> 21:38.860]  The leaves start to droop.
[21:38.860 --> 21:40.540]  The plants don't make any progress.
[21:40.540 --> 21:42.500]  They don't look as robust as they should.
[21:42.500 --> 21:43.860]  The roots are not growing.
[21:43.860 --> 21:45.940]  There's no productivity in that plant.
[21:45.940 --> 21:50.060]  They also start to develop a woody texture on the outside of the stems.
[21:50.060 --> 21:52.300]  So I encourage proper humidity.
[21:52.300 --> 21:55.660]  Too much humidity, on the other hand, can cause similar problems.
[21:55.660 --> 21:56.860]  It can cause slow growth.
[21:56.860 --> 21:57.860]  It can cause rot.
[21:57.860 --> 21:59.700]  It can encourage powdery mildew.
[21:59.700 --> 22:03.060]  Try to keep the plants happy by giving them the proper conditions.
[22:03.060 --> 22:06.780]  How much better do you perform when you are happy with your conditions?
[22:06.780 --> 22:09.380]  If I made you go do your job, some of you are going to laugh at me because you have
[22:09.380 --> 22:10.380]  to do this.
[22:10.380 --> 22:14.740]  If I made you go do your job outside in 30 degree weather and shorts and a t-shirt, how
[22:14.740 --> 22:15.980]  happy are you going to be?
[22:15.980 --> 22:17.740]  You're not going to get shit done.
[22:17.740 --> 22:22.520]  If I put you in shorts and a t-shirt and put you in a 77 degree room and I dial that humidity
[22:22.520 --> 22:26.660]  back to about 50%, you're going to be completely comfortable in that room and you're going
[22:26.660 --> 22:28.040]  to get a lot done.
[22:28.040 --> 22:30.380]  The plants feel the same about life.
[22:30.380 --> 22:34.440]  If we keep them comfortable and we keep them happy, they're going to produce for us and
[22:34.440 --> 22:35.800]  give us what we want.
[22:35.800 --> 22:39.540]  If we don't keep them happy, if we don't treat them properly, they're not going to give us
[22:39.540 --> 22:40.540]  shit.
[22:40.540 --> 22:42.380]  It's going to be a struggle the entire grow.
[22:42.380 --> 22:46.080]  So again, for temperature, I want somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees.
[22:46.080 --> 22:50.420]  Right around 75 to 77 is that sweet spot from what I have experienced.
[22:50.420 --> 22:54.620]  And then again, with humidity, I like to stay between 50 and 70%.
[22:54.620 --> 22:56.620]  Too low, you start slowing down growth.
[22:56.620 --> 22:58.900]  Too high, you start slowing down growth.
[22:58.900 --> 23:00.820]  So that is the temperature and humidity.
[23:00.820 --> 23:05.980]  Again, I highly recommend you go listen to episode 314 and learn all about vapor pressure
[23:05.980 --> 23:06.980]  deficit.
[23:06.980 --> 23:09.060]  All right, you guys, we have talked about lighting.
[23:09.060 --> 23:10.700]  We have talked about environment.
[23:10.700 --> 23:13.220]  I feel like this is going to turn into a long podcast.
[23:13.220 --> 23:14.580]  I'm 20 minutes in.
[23:14.580 --> 23:16.140]  I am going to press pause for a moment.
[23:16.140 --> 23:17.260]  I need to take a drink.
[23:17.260 --> 23:18.940]  Of course, I'm going to take a couple of dabs.
[23:18.940 --> 23:20.980]  I encourage you to dab with me.
[23:20.980 --> 23:26.580]  I will be right back and we will talk about nutrients and feeding our new small veg plants.
[23:27.100 --> 23:31.060]  Hey guys, while I'm taking a couple of dabs, I thought it would be a good opportunity to
[23:31.060 --> 23:34.420]  give thanks to people who have supported the show on Patreon.
[23:34.420 --> 23:36.460]  I want to give a huge thanks to my friend Sam.
[23:36.460 --> 23:41.700]  How about a giant thanks to Aldridge, a big giant shout out to Tanner Martinovic, and
[23:41.700 --> 23:44.780]  also a big shout out to Todd Keller.
[23:44.780 --> 23:47.060]  Thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[23:47.060 --> 23:49.980]  If you would like to learn how to support the show on Patreon, all you have to do is
[23:49.980 --> 23:56.380]  go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart and all of the information will be right there.
[23:56.380 --> 23:58.860]  Thanks again for all of the Patreon support.
[23:58.860 --> 24:00.580]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[24:00.580 --> 24:01.660]  I am well hydrated.
[24:01.660 --> 24:07.420]  I am very well medicated and I am ready to talk more about our small veg plants.
[24:07.420 --> 24:09.500]  I said we were going to jump into nutrients.
[24:09.500 --> 24:13.860]  I've got one more thing I want to add to our grow environment before we talk about what
[24:13.860 --> 24:15.660]  we are feeding.
[24:15.660 --> 24:18.980]  Let's add a small fan to our grow environment.
[24:18.980 --> 24:22.820]  I want to ruffle each leaf of our small plants as they grow.
[24:22.820 --> 24:25.860]  I don't need the fan blasting the plants constantly.
[24:25.860 --> 24:28.780]  I don't need the fan making the plants bend over.
[24:28.780 --> 24:30.940]  I don't need a whole lot of fan activity.
[24:30.940 --> 24:33.420]  If you've got an oscillating fan, that's perfect.
[24:33.420 --> 24:37.140]  Put it on low and just let it breeze across the canopy of those plants.
[24:37.140 --> 24:40.540]  It's going to make the plants more robust and it's going to make them develop stronger
[24:40.540 --> 24:44.780]  roots and I think the plants do better when we give them a little bit of wind.
[24:44.780 --> 24:45.780]  There's wind outside.
[24:45.780 --> 24:47.620]  They would get blown around a little bit.
[24:47.620 --> 24:51.540]  I think that what happens when I push you, if I shove you a little bit, not super hard,
[24:51.540 --> 24:54.260]  but if I just give you a little nudge, what do you do?
[24:54.260 --> 24:57.740]  Your instinct is to spread your feet further apart to have better balance.
[24:57.740 --> 25:01.260]  I kind of feel like if we blow on a plant, make it wobble around a little bit, maybe
[25:01.260 --> 25:04.820]  it's going to spread its roots a little bit wider to get better balance, which will also
[25:04.820 --> 25:09.580]  result in a more robust stalk, which will result in an overall more productive plant
[25:09.580 --> 25:12.460]  when we move that plant into the flowering phase.
[25:12.460 --> 25:13.940]  Let's give the plants a little bit of wind.
[25:13.940 --> 25:15.420]  They would get wind outside.
[25:15.420 --> 25:18.620]  Let's introduce a little bit of that to our indoor environment.
[25:18.620 --> 25:21.740]  Again, don't blast the plants.
[25:21.740 --> 25:27.820]  If some of the leaves closest to that fan start getting dry or leathery or crinkly,
[25:27.820 --> 25:32.460]  or they start looking like a potato chip, they're getting blasted too hard by the fan.
[25:32.460 --> 25:36.300]  Reduce either the fan speed or the frequency that they're getting hit by the fan.
[25:36.300 --> 25:40.660]  They're getting too much air movement and you're disrupting the vapor pressure deficit
[25:40.660 --> 25:41.660]  in that area.
[25:41.660 --> 25:43.500]  Pay attention to the leaves.
[25:43.500 --> 25:46.340]  They will let you know if they're getting too much wind, but give them a little bit
[25:46.340 --> 25:49.660]  of airflow and your plants will really be happy for it.
[25:49.660 --> 25:51.220]  You like a nice little breeze, don't you?
[25:51.220 --> 25:53.500]  Nice warm day, nice sunshine on your face.
[25:53.500 --> 25:54.820]  What's the next best thing that could come along?
[25:54.820 --> 25:56.420]  It's just a nice little breeze.
[25:56.420 --> 25:58.540]  I think the plants kind of feel the same way.
[25:58.540 --> 26:01.060]  So give them a nice little breeze and I think they will appreciate it.
[26:01.060 --> 26:02.140]  You'll make them stronger.
[26:02.140 --> 26:06.540]  You'll make them more robust and you'll give them just some fresh air more frequently.
[26:06.540 --> 26:11.120]  Now let's talk a little bit about nutrients for our small veg plants.
[26:11.120 --> 26:14.960]  We don't need a supercharged nutrient regimen for these little plants.
[26:14.960 --> 26:16.260]  We don't want to burn them.
[26:16.260 --> 26:17.540]  We don't want to shock them.
[26:17.540 --> 26:20.020]  We don't want to stunt them while they're babies.
[26:20.020 --> 26:24.860]  We want to focus on a balanced diet and I like to focus, like I keep saying, on root
[26:24.860 --> 26:27.060]  development for these small plants.
[26:27.060 --> 26:29.380]  So I like a light vegetative nutrient.
[26:29.380 --> 26:33.980]  If you're working with bottled nutrients, here are a few things to think about.
[26:33.980 --> 26:39.820]  If you are working in cocoa or soil or soilless mix or hydro, you need to pay attention to
[26:39.820 --> 26:46.260]  whatever product line you decide to buy and see if they offer a soil, a cocoa, or a hydro
[26:46.260 --> 26:47.260]  variety.
[26:47.260 --> 26:51.540]  The nutrients will be chelated differently and they will be in different ratios because
[26:51.540 --> 26:56.260]  your plants will uptake things differently in different mediums.
[26:56.260 --> 27:01.120]  Many of the companies that make nutrients offer a soil or a hydro option when it comes
[27:01.120 --> 27:02.800]  to buying their products.
[27:02.800 --> 27:08.260]  If you are growing in cocoa, I recommend you get the hydroponic version of the product
[27:08.260 --> 27:09.580]  you are buying.
[27:09.580 --> 27:13.920]  Cocoa is more like hydro than it is like soil or a soilless mix.
[27:13.920 --> 27:18.620]  So if you're shopping for nutrients and you're in cocoa, I would recommend that you buy the
[27:18.620 --> 27:21.840]  bottle that is recommended for hydro.
[27:21.840 --> 27:25.480]  Now when you're looking at bottled nutrients, you're going to find three numbers displayed
[27:25.480 --> 27:26.480]  on the bottle.
[27:26.480 --> 27:30.060]  That is the NPK value of that nutrient.
[27:30.060 --> 27:31.860]  The first number is nitrogen.
[27:31.860 --> 27:35.560]  That tells us the ratio of nitrogen in that product.
[27:35.560 --> 27:38.520]  The next number will be the amount of phosphorus.
[27:38.520 --> 27:41.640]  Then the next number will be the amount of potassium.
[27:41.640 --> 27:46.840]  When it comes to veg nutrients, we are looking for a product with a high N ratio and lower
[27:46.840 --> 27:48.000]  P and K numbers.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.320]  We don't need a lot of phosphorus and potassium.
[27:50.320 --> 27:55.620]  We want to focus on that nitrogen for building strong, robust plants with a lot of energy.
[27:55.620 --> 27:59.200]  So we need a good, solid, grow, base nutrient.
[27:59.200 --> 28:02.400]  Let's talk a little bit about base nutrients.
[28:02.400 --> 28:07.760]  Whatever company you choose to work with, they probably offer a two or three part base
[28:07.760 --> 28:08.820]  nutrient system.
[28:08.820 --> 28:12.040]  A lot of them will have a grow and a bloom.
[28:12.040 --> 28:13.460]  That makes it pretty obvious.
[28:13.460 --> 28:18.400]  You use the grow for your vegetative stage and you use the bloom for your flowering stage.
[28:18.400 --> 28:23.540]  A lot of companies offer a two part product, which will be an A and a B grow.
[28:23.540 --> 28:26.360]  They also offer an A and a B bloom, but we don't need those.
[28:26.360 --> 28:28.220]  So let's talk about those later.
[28:28.220 --> 28:33.920]  You will take your grow A and grow B and you will mix those into your water to create your
[28:33.920 --> 28:36.700]  vegetative nutrient base solution.
[28:36.700 --> 28:41.000]  The reason they sell an A and a B is because there are things in bottle A and things in
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.540]  bottle B that will bind together chemically if they are mixed together without being diluted
[28:46.540 --> 28:47.920]  in our water.
[28:47.920 --> 28:49.080]  So you would fill your container.
[28:49.080 --> 28:51.540]  I generally use a five gallon bucket in a home grow.
[28:51.540 --> 28:53.560]  You'd fill your five gallon bucket with water.
[28:53.560 --> 28:58.020]  You would apply the correct amount, the appropriate amount of veg A. Then you would apply the
[28:58.020 --> 29:00.700]  appropriate amount of veg B. Then you would mix it up.
[29:00.700 --> 29:03.900]  Then you would continue to add the rest of the required nutrients.
[29:03.900 --> 29:07.380]  That is a two part vegetative nutrient solution.
[29:07.380 --> 29:10.440]  Other companies will offer their products in a different format.
[29:10.440 --> 29:14.860]  They will offer what is called a base and then they will give you a grow and a bloom
[29:14.860 --> 29:16.820]  to add on top of that.
[29:16.820 --> 29:21.100]  With that type of nutrient regimen, you will use that base product through the entire cycle,
[29:21.100 --> 29:23.300]  through veg and through flower.
[29:23.300 --> 29:25.820]  Then you'll use that grow additive during the growth phase.
[29:25.820 --> 29:29.500]  And when you switch to flower, you'll switch to that flowering additive and they've just
[29:29.500 --> 29:33.880]  put the appropriate additives in those bottles to keep everything running smoothly with that
[29:33.880 --> 29:35.840]  base nutrient in there.
[29:35.840 --> 29:40.640]  Now whatever brand you choose, be sure you get the appropriate veg nutrient setup.
[29:40.640 --> 29:44.200]  If it's a two part, make sure you get the A and B. If it's the kind where you have to
[29:44.200 --> 29:48.240]  have a base and a grow nutrient, make sure you get the base and the grow.
[29:48.240 --> 29:51.840]  If you get something simple where there's just a bottle that says veg, there you go.
[29:51.840 --> 29:52.840]  You're ready to go.
[29:52.840 --> 29:54.400]  You've got that one strong veg nutrient.
[29:54.400 --> 29:55.400]  All right.
[29:55.400 --> 29:57.800]  I feel like we have a good handle on base nutrients.
[29:57.800 --> 30:02.200]  We need a good base nutrient with a strong nitrogen value.
[30:02.200 --> 30:06.800]  Now I would recommend you feed those plants maybe a quarter of the recommended strength
[30:06.800 --> 30:10.120]  for the first couple of times you feed your plants new nutrients.
[30:10.120 --> 30:13.080]  Give them a light feeding and pay close attention.
[30:13.080 --> 30:15.840]  Write it down so that you know exactly what you did.
[30:15.840 --> 30:20.120]  Also write down the pH, write down the EC if that is an option for you.
[30:20.120 --> 30:25.280]  The more notes you take, the more you can do research to dial in where you went wrong.
[30:25.280 --> 30:27.920]  A lot of us consume a lot of cannabis.
[30:27.920 --> 30:31.200]  Some of us consume cannabis while we're working in the gardens.
[30:31.200 --> 30:34.360]  Sometimes you say, I wonder what I put in there and you have no idea where you went
[30:34.360 --> 30:35.360]  wrong.
[30:35.360 --> 30:37.520]  That won't happen if you take notes and write things down.
[30:37.520 --> 30:42.320]  I've done an entire episode on journaling and I suggest you listen to that one as well.
[30:42.320 --> 30:43.960]  We've got a reliable base nutrient.
[30:43.960 --> 30:45.720]  We've decided how much to use it.
[30:45.720 --> 30:49.560]  Started a quarter strength, maybe work your way up to a third, maybe a half.
[30:49.560 --> 30:53.060]  You're definitely not going to need full strength nutrients for small plants.
[30:53.060 --> 30:56.220]  A lot of your nutrient companies will offer a feeding schedule.
[30:56.220 --> 31:00.520]  A lot of those feeding schedules will have a small plant recommendation.
[31:00.520 --> 31:06.000]  I still recommend you reduce that a little bit until you see how the plants will react.
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.200]  We've got a base nutrient.
[31:08.200 --> 31:13.960]  With small plants, I always recommend some sort of myco products, some sort of root inoculant
[31:13.960 --> 31:16.600]  products, something to make those roots go kapow.
[31:16.600 --> 31:19.280]  I try to avoid recommending specific products.
[31:19.280 --> 31:24.040]  Here is a long list of reliable products that will work great for your roots.
[31:24.040 --> 31:26.040]  I like Mammoth Pea.
[31:26.040 --> 31:28.240]  I like Plus Life from Veg Bloom.
[31:28.240 --> 31:30.880]  I like Recharge from Scotty Real.
[31:30.880 --> 31:33.800]  I like Great White Shark and Orca and MycoChum.
[31:33.800 --> 31:35.880]  I think that is a great combination.
[31:35.880 --> 31:38.320]  Some of those products are a little expensive.
[31:38.320 --> 31:39.600]  Some are more affordable.
[31:39.600 --> 31:42.040]  I can also recommend a product called Mycoz.
[31:42.040 --> 31:45.480]  It is a very affordable bag of mycob products.
[31:45.480 --> 31:51.040]  As long as you are using some sort of mycob product, I think you will see very increased
[31:51.040 --> 31:54.280]  root production compared to if you did not use it.
[31:54.280 --> 31:58.040]  Of course, I like the higher end, fancier, more expensive products, but if you can't
[31:58.040 --> 32:00.400]  afford that, get what you can afford.
[32:00.400 --> 32:06.360]  I highly recommend a microbe or a myco or a root inoculant product for your small plants.
[32:06.360 --> 32:08.480]  It will really speed up your production.
[32:08.480 --> 32:12.240]  I think the plants will really show a huge difference and you will notice it and it will
[32:12.240 --> 32:14.280]  make you a happier grower.
[32:14.280 --> 32:18.120]  We've got a reliable vegetative nutrient with enough nitrogen in it.
[32:18.120 --> 32:20.740]  We have decided on a microbe product.
[32:20.740 --> 32:25.100]  That would be enough for our small veg plants for two to four weeks.
[32:25.100 --> 32:28.360]  You may want to add some fulvic acid to your mix.
[32:28.360 --> 32:29.680]  I like adding some fulvic.
[32:29.680 --> 32:33.880]  I think it makes the plants uptake the nutrients more quickly and I think it's really worth
[32:33.880 --> 32:34.880]  the investment.
[32:34.880 --> 32:39.700]  Just a small bottle of fulvic acid will really improve your nutrient uptake in your plants.
[32:39.700 --> 32:43.940]  Now, if you've got a good solid base nutrient and you're feeding your roots, your plants
[32:43.940 --> 32:48.300]  are really happy, you've added a little fulvic acid that's increasing the uptake.
[32:48.300 --> 32:53.240]  As the plants get a little bit bigger, you may need to introduce some CalMag.
[32:53.240 --> 32:57.620]  Be careful not to overdose small plants on CalMag.
[32:57.620 --> 33:02.300]  Sometimes the young plants really don't react well to too much CalMag, so be careful.
[33:02.300 --> 33:06.840]  Now basically we've got a veg nutrient, we've got some mycos, we've got a little bit of
[33:06.840 --> 33:13.060]  fulvic acid and maybe around week three, we're going to add a dose of CalMag.
[33:13.060 --> 33:15.840]  This feed should keep our plants super happy.
[33:15.840 --> 33:20.640]  One important thing we need to think about is the pH of our feeding solution.
[33:20.640 --> 33:26.040]  For plants this size, I generally recommend we adjust the pH somewhere between 5.9 and
[33:26.040 --> 33:27.040]  6.2.
[33:27.040 --> 33:31.640]  Again, we adjust the pH after all of the nutrients have been mixed in.
[33:31.640 --> 33:36.240]  You've got your bucket of water, you add in the appropriate recommended amount of each
[33:36.240 --> 33:40.720]  bottle of nutrients, then you give it a good stir, make sure it's nice and mixed, then
[33:40.720 --> 33:44.240]  we check the pH, then we adjust accordingly.
[33:44.240 --> 33:49.640]  We've got a solid veg mix, we've got it pH adjusted, now it is time to water our plants.
[33:49.640 --> 33:54.000]  I recommend when you water, you saturate your medium thoroughly.
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.080]  Don't drown the plants, but make sure that all of the soil or cocoa or whatever medium
[33:58.080 --> 34:00.540]  you are watering, make sure it is saturated.
[34:00.540 --> 34:02.600]  We don't want any dry pockets.
[34:02.600 --> 34:07.720]  Your roots will not grow into dry spots, so moisten all of your medium.
[34:07.720 --> 34:13.400]  Now is probably a good time to remind you guys of episode 337, where I do a lesson on
[34:13.560 --> 34:16.080]  what is called 1-5 Water Tech.
[34:16.080 --> 34:20.920]  If you're a new grower and you haven't heard the 1-5 Water Tech discussion, I highly recommend
[34:20.920 --> 34:23.160]  you listen to that episode right after this.
[34:23.160 --> 34:28.560]  It is episode 337 and it will teach you a lot about watering your plants correctly.
[34:28.560 --> 34:32.400]  So we have appropriately watered our small plants with nutrients.
[34:32.400 --> 34:35.320]  When do we need to give our plants nutrients again?
[34:35.320 --> 34:37.240]  That is a really good question.
[34:37.240 --> 34:42.640]  In cocoa, I like to feed nutrients to my plants at every single watering.
[34:42.640 --> 34:46.320]  Every single day, I will feed my plants a solid base mix.
[34:46.320 --> 34:50.960]  Then I will add a booster every day and I will rotate those boosters depending on what
[34:50.960 --> 34:52.560]  the plants may need.
[34:52.560 --> 34:55.920]  In this small veg case, my booster would be the CalMag.
[34:55.920 --> 34:57.320]  I would water the nutrients.
[34:57.320 --> 35:01.920]  I would put the base nutrient, I would put the fulvic acid, and I would put the mycos
[35:01.920 --> 35:04.480]  in my nutrient solution every single day.
[35:04.480 --> 35:07.000]  Then once a week, I would put that CalMag in there.
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.980]  That would be my booster for these small plants.
[35:09.980 --> 35:14.380]  Now if you're working in soil or soilless mix, you don't need to feed nutrients as often
[35:14.380 --> 35:16.900]  because they stick around in the dirt a little better.
[35:16.900 --> 35:21.700]  I would recommend you feed with nutrients one feed, then water the next feed.
[35:21.700 --> 35:26.300]  When you're feeding with just clean water, please adjust the pH just like you do when
[35:26.300 --> 35:27.900]  you're mixing nutrients.
[35:27.900 --> 35:32.220]  Fill your container with water, stick your pH meter in there, see what it says, adjust
[35:32.220 --> 35:34.340]  it up or down accordingly.
[35:34.340 --> 35:37.300]  You need to adjust the pH at every feeding.
[35:37.300 --> 35:42.700]  I would recommend you do one feeding of nutrients, one watering of pH adjusted water, then I
[35:42.700 --> 35:47.140]  would go back to that basic nutrient regimen for the next watering.
[35:47.140 --> 35:50.220]  These small veg plants will need frequent watering.
[35:50.220 --> 35:51.340]  Pay attention to them.
[35:51.340 --> 35:52.820]  Don't let them get too dry.
[35:52.820 --> 35:54.100]  Don't let them be over watered.
[35:54.100 --> 35:57.420]  Once again, check out the one through five watering tech.
[35:57.420 --> 36:00.780]  Another thing we need to pay attention to is over-nutrienting.
[36:00.780 --> 36:02.460]  Are we over-fertilizing these plants?
[36:02.460 --> 36:03.620]  Are we burning them?
[36:03.620 --> 36:05.660]  Pay attention to the leaf tips.
[36:05.660 --> 36:10.100]  If the very tips of the leaves start to look brown or the wrong color, or if they start
[36:10.100 --> 36:12.300]  to curl, we are feeding too much.
[36:12.300 --> 36:16.560]  If your leaves look pale and yellow, we are not feeding enough.
[36:16.560 --> 36:20.780]  If you have a mixture of those two symptoms, your pH is probably off.
[36:20.780 --> 36:24.980]  One of the very first things I recommended in these grow lessons was that you buy a book
[36:24.980 --> 36:26.780]  and you read it.
[36:26.780 --> 36:28.600]  Hopefully you've already done some reading.
[36:28.600 --> 36:32.320]  Hopefully you have looked at some leaf charts and you know what deficiencies look like so
[36:32.320 --> 36:33.860]  you know what to pay attention to.
[36:33.860 --> 36:37.980]  You know what a healthy leaf looks like and you know what an unhealthy leaf looks like.
[36:37.980 --> 36:39.500]  It's going to pop out in your head.
[36:39.500 --> 36:42.340]  When you see those leaves doing something weird, you're going to say, that's not what
[36:42.340 --> 36:44.940]  the book said this should look like.
[36:44.940 --> 36:46.360]  Hopefully you've gotten the book.
[36:46.360 --> 36:48.220]  Hopefully you have read the book.
[36:48.220 --> 36:49.340]  Pay attention to your plants.
[36:49.340 --> 36:53.820]  If they are showing you that they need more nutrients, increase your nutrients.
[36:53.820 --> 36:56.000]  Give it a little more base nutrients.
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.200]  You probably don't need to increase the amount of fulvic.
[36:59.200 --> 37:05.280]  When it comes to mycos, I have learned that it is better to feed small amounts more frequently
[37:05.280 --> 37:08.320]  than to try to feed a whole bunch at one time.
[37:08.320 --> 37:11.280]  You're not going to do any good by pouring the whole bottle in there at one time.
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.520]  It would be more effective to pour the bottle in there slowly over a course of time.
[37:16.520 --> 37:20.120]  Maybe if you see a deficiency, just increase that base nutrient.
[37:20.120 --> 37:23.640]  What you're going to run into a deficiency with in small plants is either going to be
[37:23.640 --> 37:25.800]  nitrogen or cow mag.
[37:25.800 --> 37:28.280]  That is going to be your most common deficiency.
[37:28.360 --> 37:33.160]  Pay attention to those two things and learn what that looks like.
[37:33.160 --> 37:36.320]  The next common thing you're going to find is nutrient burn.
[37:36.320 --> 37:39.240]  People are going to try to feed too much to these plants.
[37:39.240 --> 37:41.920]  I heard somebody say the term moron.
[37:41.920 --> 37:45.400]  I just want to put more on it to make it grow faster.
[37:45.400 --> 37:47.280]  I thought it was hilarious when I heard that.
[37:47.280 --> 37:49.200]  I know a lot of people like that.
[37:49.200 --> 37:50.720]  Don't be that guy.
[37:50.720 --> 37:55.480]  Now, if you're running a hydroponic system, if you're in Rockwell Cubes and you're doing
[37:55.480 --> 38:00.280]  a top feed, or if you're in some type of ebb and flow system, your small veg phase
[38:00.280 --> 38:04.840]  will not be nearly as long as us growing in cocoa or a soilless mix.
[38:04.840 --> 38:07.520]  Your small veg phase zips right by.
[38:07.520 --> 38:10.860]  I think the hydro grows go much more quickly in veg.
[38:10.860 --> 38:13.940]  Your small veg phase may be only about a week long.
[38:13.940 --> 38:20.720]  You're going to need to introduce more nutrients at a higher rate sooner in a hydroponic setup.
[38:20.720 --> 38:22.360]  But pay attention to the plants.
[38:22.360 --> 38:25.760]  That is very plant-specific and very strain-specific.
[38:25.760 --> 38:31.440]  But since the plants grow a little more quickly, you are going to need more nutrients sooner.
[38:31.440 --> 38:36.280]  One thing I'm going to remind you of in your hydroponics is to stay on top of your pH and
[38:36.280 --> 38:38.400]  your EC or your PPMs.
[38:38.400 --> 38:42.720]  Check it every single day and adjust as needed.
[38:42.720 --> 38:47.880]  Water is going to evaporate from your hydroponic setup, but the nutrients will not evaporate.
[38:47.880 --> 38:52.320]  So your pH and your PPMs are going to fluctuate during that evaporation.
[38:52.320 --> 38:55.360]  Also, the plants are going to consume some of the water.
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.280]  So the water is going to disappear throughout the day, which is going to cause changes in
[38:59.280 --> 39:00.800]  your reservoir.
[39:00.800 --> 39:05.160]  As a hydroponic grower, you need to be on top of that every single day.
[39:05.160 --> 39:10.600]  Also, I'm going to recommend you take extra notes as a hydro grower.
[39:10.600 --> 39:13.680]  Reactions happen a little more quickly and the plants are a little more sensitive when
[39:13.680 --> 39:18.840]  you're running hydro because you don't have that big soil life system to work as a buffer.
[39:18.840 --> 39:23.240]  All right, boys and girls, I feel like that is a good talk on small veg.
[39:23.240 --> 39:27.120]  We're going to leave these plants in these pots for two to four weeks, depending on how
[39:27.120 --> 39:28.580]  quickly they grow.
[39:28.580 --> 39:29.840]  That's very strain-dependent.
[39:29.840 --> 39:32.080]  That's very environment-dependent.
[39:32.080 --> 39:36.000]  One thing I want to remind you to do is spread your small veg plants out.
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.080]  We do have them crushed together now because they're small plants, but as they get larger,
[39:40.080 --> 39:41.360]  make sure you spread them out.
[39:41.360 --> 39:42.360]  Give them more space.
[39:42.360 --> 39:43.360]  They want to grow.
[39:44.040 --> 39:45.040]  They want to branch out.
[39:45.040 --> 39:47.960]  If you've got them all crushed together, they're going to grow straight up and get really,
[39:47.960 --> 39:48.960]  really tall.
[39:48.960 --> 39:51.800]  If you give them space to branch out, they will do so.
[39:51.800 --> 39:54.680]  Then when you top them, you've got nice bushes.
[39:54.680 --> 39:56.400]  That's coming up in the future.
[39:56.400 --> 39:58.440]  You guys, I know I didn't talk about soil.
[39:58.440 --> 40:00.600]  I didn't talk about containers in this episode.
[40:00.600 --> 40:04.560]  I feel like I covered that in the previous episode, so we were up to speed there.
[40:04.560 --> 40:07.680]  We're going to leave these plants in these containers for two to four weeks.
[40:07.680 --> 40:13.100]  Then we will pot them into three gallon or five gallon or perhaps seven gallon containers.
[40:13.840 --> 40:16.740]  Maybe some of you out there are going to go huge and go into a 20 or an even larger container,
[40:16.740 --> 40:19.420]  but we're going to work on that on the next episode.
[40:19.420 --> 40:21.980]  We've got a little time to let these plants grow.
[40:21.980 --> 40:26.800]  Your job now is to keep them healthy, keep them happy, keep them pest and pathogen free.
[40:26.800 --> 40:28.540]  Keep working on those roots.
[40:28.540 --> 40:32.580]  If you see any yellow or funky leaves, make sure you pull that stuff off.
[40:32.580 --> 40:34.520]  Just take good care of your new sweet little babies.
[40:34.520 --> 40:38.100]  Make sure they don't have any problems so that when we transplant them into their bigger
[40:38.100 --> 40:39.580]  pots, they're ready to go.
[40:39.580 --> 40:43.860]  We've got a fat root system and they don't go into any shock from a transplant.
[40:43.860 --> 40:48.140]  I just realized that I did not cover any pest management for our small plants.
[40:48.140 --> 40:50.420]  Let's talk about that really quickly.
[40:50.420 --> 40:55.340]  Hopefully you have decided on an integrated pest management system for your garden before
[40:55.340 --> 40:56.340]  this point.
[40:56.340 --> 40:59.060]  Hopefully that was part of your planning phase.
[40:59.060 --> 41:02.640]  Hopefully we don't have any pests or problems on our small plants.
[41:02.640 --> 41:06.780]  Some folks will choose to apply a pesticide as a preventative.
[41:06.780 --> 41:12.140]  Some folks will wait until they see a problem to use a pesticide on a plant this small.
[41:12.140 --> 41:16.660]  I would like to wait until I transplant these into their three gallon pots before I put
[41:16.660 --> 41:18.340]  any pesticides on them.
[41:18.340 --> 41:23.100]  However, in some environments, I don't trust the place and I need to put a pesticide on
[41:23.100 --> 41:24.100]  it.
[41:24.100 --> 41:29.340]  I would use something like evergreen and I would probably use it around 15 mils per gallon.
[41:29.340 --> 41:33.140]  I would make sure to apply it while the lights were off and I would be sure that the plants
[41:33.140 --> 41:36.900]  were completely dry before I turned the lights back on.
[41:36.900 --> 41:42.700]  I would probably do this approximately every five to seven days while the plants are little
[41:42.700 --> 41:48.180]  if I were in a place that had a reputation for getting a pest infestation.
[41:48.180 --> 41:52.260]  I feel like that should keep us pest free for the first four weeks and then we can really
[41:52.260 --> 41:58.060]  start implementing our integrated pest management once we transplant into those three gallon
[41:58.060 --> 41:59.060]  pots.
[41:59.060 --> 42:00.180]  All right, podcast world.
[42:00.180 --> 42:03.620]  I feel like that is a solid show about small veg.
[42:03.620 --> 42:07.700]  If you feel like this episode was educational, informative, or entertaining and you would
[42:07.700 --> 42:11.980]  like to make a financial contribution to the show, I encourage you to do so.
[42:11.980 --> 42:17.700]  You can do that by going to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[42:17.700 --> 42:21.340]  All of the information you need to become a patron will be right there on the screen
[42:21.340 --> 42:23.340]  and I do appreciate all of the support.
[42:23.340 --> 42:27.500]  Now, while I'm talking about Patreon, let me bring up something I keep forgetting to
[42:27.500 --> 42:29.340]  mention on the podcast.
[42:29.500 --> 42:35.140]  Recently, Patreon changed the way that contributors cards are billed.
[42:35.140 --> 42:40.700]  During that process, many contributors were removed from content creators pages.
[42:40.700 --> 42:45.420]  If you feel like you are contributing to a Patreon campaign, I encourage you to log into
[42:45.420 --> 42:50.300]  your Patreon account and check the status of all your content creators.
[42:50.300 --> 42:53.980]  Please make sure you are still signed up and contributing to all of the people in which
[42:53.980 --> 42:55.900]  you have been supporting.
[42:55.900 --> 43:00.540]  Grow from our community means a lot to content creators and it would really break our hearts
[43:00.540 --> 43:03.620]  to lose contributions because of a technical glitch.
[43:03.620 --> 43:06.340]  Again, please check on your Patreon campaigns.
[43:06.340 --> 43:09.860]  Make sure you are contributing to all of the creators which you believe you are creating
[43:09.860 --> 43:13.060]  and keep the vibe alive and keep showing them love and support.
[43:13.060 --> 43:15.860]  All right, you guys, that's all I've got for you for this week.
[43:15.860 --> 43:19.500]  I would appreciate it if you find me on the social media, on Facebook.
[43:19.500 --> 43:21.900]  Simply search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast on Twitter.
[43:21.900 --> 43:24.060]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[43:24.060 --> 43:26.260]  Of course, I do have an Instagram feed.
[43:26.260 --> 43:28.400]  It's irie underscore genetics.
[43:28.400 --> 43:29.400]  Find me on Instagram.
[43:29.400 --> 43:31.300]  Jump into my Instagram live videos.
[43:31.300 --> 43:34.860]  You can hang out, take dabs, chat, ask me some questions.
[43:34.860 --> 43:37.700]  Maybe I will answer your questions there on the live feed.
[43:37.700 --> 43:39.620]  I encourage you to join.
[43:39.620 --> 43:42.420]  Don't forget that I added some new merchandise to my web store.
[43:42.420 --> 43:47.380]  Go to iriegeneticscolorado.com slash irie-store.
[43:47.380 --> 43:50.000]  There are Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirts.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.200]  There are Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodies.
[43:52.200 --> 43:57.680]  There are Irie Genetics t-shirts and hoodies, and there are new Irie Army t-shirts.
[43:57.680 --> 44:01.940]  I think they would all look great on you, so support the web store.

[44:04.880 --> 44:07.760]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[44:07.760 --> 44:10.400]  I do love all of the interaction.
[44:10.400 --> 44:12.600]  Make sure you support our sponsor, the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[44:12.600 --> 44:15.240]  Of course, they are at dankseed.store.
[44:15.240 --> 44:19.280]  You guys, my voice is burning out just in time, so thanks for listening to this episode.
[44:19.280 --> 44:21.680]  I'll be back in a couple of days with another grow lesson.
[44:21.680 --> 44:25.480]  I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy, Stabby McStabberson.
[44:25.480 --> 44:29.200]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[44:29.200 --> 44:30.800]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[44:30.800 --> 44:34.560]  It's time for episode 369 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[44:34.560 --> 44:37.680]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[44:37.680 --> 44:42.640]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[44:42.640 --> 44:48.320]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[44:48.360 --> 44:51.560]  You guys know I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[44:51.560 --> 44:56.840]  Today, I'm taking dabs of something called Fluffernutter Sauce from Contraband Concentrates.
[44:56.840 --> 44:59.720]  I picked this up at a cut above in Colorado Springs.
[44:59.720 --> 45:02.560]  This stuff has a very unique aroma and flavor to it.
[45:02.560 --> 45:05.720]  I'm going to bust the container open again just to get a fresh smell to try to explain
[45:05.720 --> 45:07.920]  this to you.
[45:07.920 --> 45:10.960]  It's got that dryer sheet sort of smell that I really enjoy.
[45:10.960 --> 45:14.400]  A lot of the concentrates from Contraband have that dryer sheet terp.
[45:14.400 --> 45:16.600]  I'm not sure which terp that is.
[45:16.600 --> 45:17.640]  It really smells great.
[45:17.640 --> 45:19.200]  My body really likes it.
[45:19.200 --> 45:20.400]  It's kind of sweet.
[45:20.400 --> 45:21.720]  It's kind of sharp.
[45:21.720 --> 45:24.280]  It's got almost a citrus thing to it.
[45:24.280 --> 45:26.880]  If you let it sit on the nose for a minute and you just give it a nice smell and let
[45:26.880 --> 45:31.520]  it rest, it has a really warm aroma to it, something warm in the background.
[45:31.520 --> 45:32.720]  That may sound crazy.
[45:32.720 --> 45:36.600]  A lot of people tell me that my strain descriptions are completely crazy, but if you bought a
[45:36.600 --> 45:39.960]  gram of this and you cracked it open and gave it a smell, you would say that is sweet with
[45:39.960 --> 45:44.400]  a hint of citrus with a little warmth at the end, and you would probably agree with me.
[45:44.400 --> 45:48.880]  You guys, I always love the high of the products I buy from Contraband Concentrates.
[45:48.880 --> 45:50.280]  It's always got that nice head buzz.
[45:50.280 --> 45:55.640]  I feel like maybe that sharp dryer sheet sort of aroma has something to do with the head
[45:55.640 --> 45:57.520]  buzz that I get from this concentrate.
[45:57.520 --> 45:59.080]  Anyway, they always do a good job.
[45:59.080 --> 46:02.320]  Big shout out to the Fluffernutter Sauce from Contraband Concentrates.
[46:02.320 --> 46:04.680]  It's obviously got me nice and rambly.
[46:04.680 --> 46:06.960]  This will be a great podcast.
[46:06.960 --> 46:10.400]  I do have a lot of great information written down for you in this episode, but before we
[46:10.400 --> 46:13.760]  get to it, I would like to give a few people some shout outs.
[46:14.120 --> 46:15.440]  Let's start off with Brett Gorman.
[46:15.440 --> 46:17.440]  How about a big giant shout out to Brett Gorman?
[46:17.440 --> 46:18.840]  Thanks for all the support, dude.
[46:18.840 --> 46:20.160]  Also a big shout out to Aldridge.
[46:20.160 --> 46:22.360]  Once again, I totally appreciate that support.
[46:22.360 --> 46:27.560]  And also a shout out to Sam and Steve F. Thank you for all of the support on Patreon.
[46:27.560 --> 46:30.240]  I truly do appreciate that.

[46:37.840 --> 46:39.880]  And once again, thanks for all the support, everybody.
[46:39.880 --> 46:41.080]  It does mean a lot to me.
[46:41.080 --> 46:42.640]  All right, podcast world.
[46:42.640 --> 46:45.500]  In this episode, I am going to do another grow lesson.
[46:45.500 --> 46:49.960]  If you have been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[46:49.960 --> 46:52.560]  In that series, we set a goal for our grow.
[46:52.560 --> 46:54.640]  We found a safe place for our grow.
[46:54.640 --> 46:57.360]  We've selected the appropriate equipment for our grow.
[46:57.360 --> 47:01.680]  We've also selected the appropriate nutrients and pest management system for that grow.
[47:01.680 --> 47:04.800]  Now we have either sprouted seeds or potted some clones.
[47:04.800 --> 47:09.520]  Now in this point of our grow, we have got clones or seedlings in small pots.
[47:09.520 --> 47:13.520]  They're probably six to 10 inches tall at this point, and they're developing nice fat
[47:13.520 --> 47:14.520]  roots.
[47:14.520 --> 47:16.240]  That's where we are in these grow lessons.
[47:16.240 --> 47:19.680]  In this lesson, I plan to talk a little bit more about small veg.
[47:19.680 --> 47:23.120]  We're going to continue that conversation since time has progressed, since we put our
[47:23.120 --> 47:25.040]  plants into the small pots.
[47:25.040 --> 47:29.080]  Then I want to work my way into talking about microbe products and root development and
[47:29.080 --> 47:34.880]  the importance of healthy roots and the benefits of using a quality microbe product.
[47:34.880 --> 47:36.760]  Some of this episode may feel like a recap.
[47:36.760 --> 47:40.760]  Some of it will be a recap, but we will work our way right into our current state, so be
[47:40.760 --> 47:41.760]  patient.
[47:41.760 --> 47:43.680]  Sometimes I feel like it's good to remind people.
[47:43.680 --> 47:47.760]  Not everybody listens to every episode, so I like to get people up to speed.
[47:47.760 --> 47:50.440]  Before I move forward, I do need to correct myself.
[47:50.440 --> 47:52.840]  I made a mistake on the last episode.
[47:52.840 --> 47:56.960]  In the last episode, I was talking about ideal lighting for our small plants, and I feel
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.160]  like I completely overlooked ceramic metal halide lighting.
[48:01.160 --> 48:05.960]  Ceramic metal halide lighting is a very viable and useful option for your small plants.
[48:05.960 --> 48:10.320]  If you feel like I left you out by not mentioning the CMH lighting, I apologize.
[48:10.320 --> 48:14.640]  Those are quality lights, and I recommend new growers to use those lights for small
[48:14.640 --> 48:15.640]  plants if that is an option.
[48:15.640 --> 48:19.000]  They are affordable, they don't put out a lot of light, and they don't use a lot of
[48:19.000 --> 48:25.280]  electricity, so a ceramic metal halide light is a very viable option for a new grower for
[48:25.280 --> 48:26.280]  small plants.
[48:26.280 --> 48:31.120]  Also, if you want to step up, move up from the 315s to the 630s, I've seen great results
[48:31.120 --> 48:34.280]  with those in a flowering room as well.
[48:34.280 --> 48:36.560]  Don't let me forget the ceramic metal halide lighting anymore.
[48:36.560 --> 48:39.640]  That is always a viable option in a cannabis grow.
[48:39.640 --> 48:44.440]  Now let's get back on track and talk more about continuing our small veg phase.
[48:44.440 --> 48:50.200]  Again, what I consider small veg are small plants, anything basically from a cloner or
[48:50.200 --> 48:54.560]  a seedling that is in a small pot, maybe like a four-inch pot, maybe a six-inch net pot,
[48:54.560 --> 48:56.600]  maybe all the way up to an eight-inch pot.
[48:56.600 --> 49:00.480]  But our smaller plants that don't have a super strong, healthy developed root system are
[49:00.480 --> 49:03.320]  plants that are probably only eight to 10 inches tall.
[49:03.360 --> 49:06.720]  Those are what I am considering my small veg plants.
[49:06.720 --> 49:11.600]  Now up to this point, we've mainly been focusing on healthy, pest and pathogen-free plants.
[49:11.600 --> 49:16.020]  I suggest you check every day for the presence of pests or pathogens.
[49:16.020 --> 49:19.640]  Even as the plants are small, we still need to pay close attention.
[49:19.640 --> 49:23.040]  Flip a leaf over, see if you see any weirdness on the bottom of the leaves.
[49:23.040 --> 49:24.640]  Pay attention to the tops of the leaves.
[49:24.640 --> 49:25.800]  Do you see any stippling?
[49:25.800 --> 49:27.000]  That's a sign of spider mites.
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.680]  Do you see any gooey stuff?
[49:28.680 --> 49:30.020]  That's a sign of thrips.
[49:30.020 --> 49:31.480]  Just pay attention.
[49:31.480 --> 49:32.480]  Flick some of the plants.
[49:32.480 --> 49:33.480]  Flick some of the containers.
[49:33.480 --> 49:35.000]  Do you see anything fly out?
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.800]  That is a sign of either fungus gnats or white flies.
[49:37.800 --> 49:38.960]  If they're white, they're white flies.
[49:38.960 --> 49:41.240]  If they're black, they're probably fungus gnats.
[49:41.240 --> 49:43.880]  Just pay attention for pests in our small plants.
[49:43.880 --> 49:48.320]  It's really easy to take care of them if we do get them, but we need to identify our problems
[49:48.320 --> 49:51.920]  early so that we can conquer them before they get out of control.
[49:51.920 --> 49:54.720]  Go in and check for pests every day.
[49:54.720 --> 49:56.180]  Check for powdery mildew.
[49:56.180 --> 49:59.160]  You should be able to spot it on these little plants very easily.
[49:59.160 --> 50:01.280]  It will start in the center of a leaf.
[50:01.280 --> 50:04.680]  It will usually start at the whitest point of one of your biggest leaves.
[50:04.680 --> 50:08.800]  It will look like somebody just took a little drop of donut powdered sugar and just dropped
[50:08.800 --> 50:09.800]  it right on your leaf.
[50:09.800 --> 50:14.120]  It will look like some sort of white powdery water that dried up and just left a little
[50:14.120 --> 50:15.420]  stain right there.
[50:15.420 --> 50:18.160]  That is the first indicator of powdery mildew.
[50:18.160 --> 50:20.960]  It will probably happen in a low light area.
[50:20.960 --> 50:24.200]  We are not getting a lot of light, but there is a lot of moisture.
[50:24.200 --> 50:27.900]  Oftentimes it will happen where that little bit of water just hangs on that one leaf in
[50:27.900 --> 50:30.360]  that one spot and it never quite goes away.
[50:30.440 --> 50:32.440]  That is where you are going to get the PM.
[50:32.440 --> 50:33.640]  Pay attention for bugs.
[50:33.640 --> 50:35.380]  Pay attention for powdery mildew.
[50:35.380 --> 50:40.640]  Our main goal right now is to keep these plants pest and pathogen free and keep them developing
[50:40.640 --> 50:45.760]  strong healthy root systems so that we have strong healthy plants when it is time to transplant
[50:45.760 --> 50:48.520]  them and then later move them into flower.
[50:48.520 --> 50:51.440]  Now that your plants are starting to grow and you have spent some time with them, you
[50:51.440 --> 50:55.120]  have probably seen what happens when you over and underwater them a little bit.
[50:55.120 --> 50:59.360]  You have probably done one or the other, which has probably caused a little bit of funky
[50:59.360 --> 51:02.920]  I encourage you to pull off all of the ugly leaves.
[51:02.920 --> 51:06.280]  If you have got yellowing, crispy leaves, take those off.
[51:06.280 --> 51:10.240]  Those yellow leaves are an invitation for spider mites.
[51:10.240 --> 51:14.080]  That is why we use yellow sticky cards in the garden to help the pests go to those cards.
[51:14.080 --> 51:17.760]  We see them on the cards and we can tell that they are there, but the pests love to go to
[51:17.760 --> 51:18.760]  that yellow.
[51:18.760 --> 51:20.240]  They think that is a weak leaf.
[51:20.240 --> 51:24.200]  Imagine you are a hungry spider mite and you see a big healthy robust leaf that has got
[51:24.200 --> 51:28.440]  a really thick layer of healthy vegetation to chew through before you can get some nutrients
[51:28.520 --> 51:29.520]  out of it.
[51:29.520 --> 51:33.040]  Or imagine just a little lower on the plant, you have got a weak leaf that is yellow on
[51:33.040 --> 51:34.040]  the outside.
[51:34.040 --> 51:36.960]  It has got a real thin layer and you can just poke right through it and suck all the juice
[51:36.960 --> 51:40.280]  you want right out of it like a hungry little vampire bug you are.
[51:40.280 --> 51:42.960]  You are going to go right to those weak yellow leaves.
[51:42.960 --> 51:44.520]  It is not as much work for food.
[51:44.520 --> 51:46.280]  You can get right in there and get what you need.
[51:46.280 --> 51:49.360]  The spider mites are going right for that yellow weak part.
[51:49.360 --> 51:50.840]  Pull off all those weak parts.
[51:50.840 --> 51:52.320]  Pull off all the yellow leaves.
[51:52.320 --> 51:54.120]  That is where the problems are going to start anyway.
[51:54.120 --> 51:55.800]  That is where the plant is the weakest.
[51:55.800 --> 51:57.320]  Get that out of there.
[51:57.320 --> 52:00.880]  Now while you are pulling off leaves, you may notice that the couple of branches at
[52:00.880 --> 52:04.560]  the very bottom of your plant are just weak and shitty and kind of in the way.
[52:04.560 --> 52:07.760]  If you have got a couple of leaves that are hanging down into the dirt, pick that stuff
[52:07.760 --> 52:08.760]  right off.
[52:08.760 --> 52:10.600]  We do not need that very bottom crap on the plant.
[52:10.600 --> 52:15.360]  By the time it makes it to flower, we are going to clean up the bottom 8 to 10 inches
[52:15.360 --> 52:16.640]  of that stalk anyway.
[52:16.640 --> 52:19.120]  Those bottom branches will not even be there.
[52:19.120 --> 52:22.800]  I feel like if you take some of those little sucker branches off the bottom now, it will
[52:22.800 --> 52:25.240]  encourage growth up to the top of the plant.
[52:25.240 --> 52:26.520]  We do not need that stuff on the bottom.
[52:26.720 --> 52:28.040]  The light is not going to get to it.
[52:28.040 --> 52:29.680]  That is where the problems are going to happen.
[52:29.680 --> 52:31.840]  Why not cut that stuff right off?
[52:31.840 --> 52:35.480]  If you are happy with the way your plants look without pruning anything off the bottom,
[52:35.480 --> 52:37.120]  you do not have to do it.
[52:37.120 --> 52:40.600]  But if you have got two or three branches on the bottom that just are not growing to
[52:40.600 --> 52:44.300]  reach the rest of the branches, if they look weak, why not take them off?
[52:44.300 --> 52:48.000]  We do not need that weak shit down there at the bottom of the plant, wasting energy, wasting
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.080]  nutrients and wasting water.
[52:50.080 --> 52:53.640]  Let us just cut it right off and send that energy right up to the top of the plant.
[52:53.760 --> 52:57.320]  As the plants get bigger, you will notice they are starting to branch out a little bit.
[52:57.320 --> 53:01.200]  On the bottoms of some of the branches, you may start developing shoots.
[53:01.200 --> 53:04.920]  If those little shoots are weak, you can pinch those off as well.
[53:04.920 --> 53:07.160]  You do not have to take off the entire branch.
[53:07.160 --> 53:10.600]  You can just take off the shitty shoots at the bottom and you can still leave the ends
[53:10.600 --> 53:14.920]  of those branches and you can still have more bud sites and more branches.
[53:14.920 --> 53:16.560]  Do not take off too much now.
[53:16.560 --> 53:18.820]  You can always take off more in the future.
[53:18.820 --> 53:21.840]  You cannot glue branches back onto the plant.
[53:21.840 --> 53:25.760]  Keep in mind the plant grows out of the top, so the shit you take off the bottom will not
[53:25.760 --> 53:26.760]  replace itself.
[53:26.760 --> 53:28.560]  You're cleaning up the bottom, that is gone.
[53:28.560 --> 53:30.320]  It's going to grow out of the top.
[53:30.320 --> 53:31.320]  Keep that in mind.
[53:31.320 --> 53:33.320]  Now, let's talk a little bit about nutrients.
[53:33.320 --> 53:36.020]  I always recommend starting off with light nutrients.
[53:36.020 --> 53:39.360]  If your plants are showing any yellow or if they're not growing as quickly as you would
[53:39.360 --> 53:44.120]  like them to, you may need to increase the overall amount of nutrients we are giving
[53:44.120 --> 53:45.120]  the plants.
[53:45.120 --> 53:48.600]  I always recommend starting low and increasing as time goes on.
[53:48.600 --> 53:52.200]  If your plants are a little bit pale or yellowish, if they're not as green as we would hope they
[53:52.200 --> 53:56.000]  would be at this point, it is probably time to increase our nutrients.
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.560]  Also, it may be time to add some cow mag to the mix.
[53:59.560 --> 54:03.200]  If your plants are growing properly, if they're nice and robust, if they've got a nice root
[54:03.200 --> 54:08.360]  system in this small pot, I would recommend adding a small dose of cow mag once a week
[54:08.360 --> 54:10.360]  to your feeding regimen.
[54:10.360 --> 54:13.800]  If you feel like you're feeding your plants properly, you're giving them a proper amount
[54:13.800 --> 54:17.520]  of nitrogen, you're giving them the proper amount of cow mag, you're also giving them
[54:17.520 --> 54:21.520]  some beneficials for the roots, and you're not seeing the growth you would like to see,
[54:21.520 --> 54:24.800]  I would suspect that it's probably a pH issue.
[54:24.800 --> 54:28.000]  Check the pH of the solution you are feeding your plants.
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.840]  If your pH is off, your plants won't be able to uptake nutrients, which means they will
[54:31.840 --> 54:33.200]  not grow.
[54:33.200 --> 54:37.640]  So once you have mixed up your nutrients, put your pH pin in there and see what the
[54:37.640 --> 54:41.840]  pH of that solution is before you feed it to your plants.
[54:41.840 --> 54:44.800]  If it's not in the appropriate range, adjust it.
[54:44.800 --> 54:47.420]  This is such an overlooked step.
[54:47.420 --> 54:51.060]  Most of the time when people send me pictures of their plants, they say, what is wrong with
[54:51.060 --> 54:52.060]  my plant?
[54:52.060 --> 54:55.860]  I ask them, what was the pH of your last feeding solution?
[54:55.860 --> 54:57.380]  You know what most of their answers are?
[54:57.380 --> 54:58.540]  I don't know.
[54:58.540 --> 55:02.300]  So I usually tell them, check the pH and get back to me, because I would assume if you're
[55:02.300 --> 55:05.220]  not checking the pH, that is probably the issue.
[55:05.220 --> 55:07.020]  You didn't even bother to check.
[55:07.020 --> 55:09.580]  How do I know if you've got another nutritional problem?
[55:09.580 --> 55:14.140]  How do I know if you're overfeeding or underfeeding a specific nutrient if I don't know what the
[55:14.140 --> 55:15.980]  pH of your solution is?
[55:15.980 --> 55:17.900]  You have got to dial in the pH.
[55:17.900 --> 55:21.820]  I've done an entire episode on the importance of pH.
[55:21.820 --> 55:26.500]  For these small plants, I really think they would be happiest with a pH right around 6.1
[55:26.500 --> 55:27.500]  or 6.2.
[55:27.500 --> 55:32.540]  You can go 5.8 to 6.3 if you really want to have a wide range, but I think 6.1 or 6.2
[55:32.540 --> 55:37.420]  in cocoa or soilless mix is going to be ideal for these small plants.
[55:37.420 --> 55:41.740]  We may increase that pH as we go along the grow process, as we pay attention to the plants
[55:41.740 --> 55:43.780]  and see how they react to certain things.
[55:43.860 --> 55:48.740]  For now, I think this 6.2 is right about where we need to be.
[55:48.740 --> 55:49.980]  We've got clean, healthy plants.
[55:49.980 --> 55:50.980]  We don't have any bugs.
[55:50.980 --> 55:52.420]  We don't have any powdery mildew.
[55:52.420 --> 55:56.420]  We have increased our nutrients to increase our vigor and increase growth speed.
[55:56.420 --> 55:59.360]  It is probably time to spread your plants out.
[55:59.360 --> 56:03.300]  If they're too pressed together, if they're too crowded, they're not going to branch out
[56:03.300 --> 56:04.300]  properly.
[56:04.300 --> 56:07.400]  If you've got them crushed in there real tight, it's time to spread them out.
[56:07.400 --> 56:11.380]  If it looks like your plants are getting too tall and too skinny and too stretchy, it's
[56:11.380 --> 56:12.380]  one of two things.
[56:12.620 --> 56:16.540]  They either want more light or they are too close together, which probably just means
[56:16.540 --> 56:18.100]  they want more light.
[56:18.100 --> 56:21.820]  If you've got branches pressed together, if you've got leaves pressed together, if you've
[56:21.820 --> 56:26.200]  got plants overlapping each other, if you've got one plant pressed up against the wall,
[56:26.200 --> 56:28.300]  they know they're too tight together.
[56:28.300 --> 56:31.740]  Instead of branching out, they're going to go straight up and try to get some light.
[56:31.740 --> 56:33.860]  They're all competing for light space.
[56:33.860 --> 56:38.200]  You're probably running your small veg under smaller lights, which means they're really
[56:38.200 --> 56:40.700]  competing for that space if we crowd them in.
[56:40.700 --> 56:41.700]  Spread them out.
[56:42.020 --> 56:43.020]  Let them get some light.
[56:43.020 --> 56:48.200]  Light is the number one desired nutrient and source of energy for our plants over their
[56:48.200 --> 56:49.740]  entire life cycles.
[56:49.740 --> 56:51.960]  They want light more than anything.
[56:51.960 --> 56:53.240]  Light is the key.
[56:53.240 --> 56:55.620]  These plants think they're going to get the sun.
[56:55.620 --> 56:59.740]  We brought them indoors and wired up little T5 bulbs, and we're trying to make them grow
[56:59.740 --> 57:00.740]  with that.
[57:00.740 --> 57:04.560]  So spoil them and give them as much of that T5 lighting as they can get.
[57:04.560 --> 57:08.880]  Give them as much space as they can handle so that you can get maximum performance from
[57:08.880 --> 57:10.520]  our small plants.
[57:10.540 --> 57:13.660]  Now I feel like we've got healthy plants that are pest free.
[57:13.660 --> 57:16.120]  They're probably about eight to 10 inches tall.
[57:16.120 --> 57:18.400]  We're starting to get nice branching on the bottom.
[57:18.400 --> 57:20.400]  We've cleaned up those crappy branches on the bottom.
[57:20.400 --> 57:22.160]  We've pulled off any funky leaves.
[57:22.160 --> 57:24.580]  We've spread them out so that they're not too crowded.
[57:24.580 --> 57:28.920]  We are probably going to transplant these plants into their forever homes within the
[57:28.920 --> 57:30.600]  next week or two.
[57:30.600 --> 57:33.440]  That's going to be the next grow lesson that I provide.
[57:33.440 --> 57:36.300]  We'll be transplanting into our forever homes.
[57:36.300 --> 57:42.020]  I think one thing we should really focus on until we transplant is fat root development.
[57:42.020 --> 57:47.020]  I like my plants to be nearly root bound in these small pots before I transplant them.
[57:47.020 --> 57:51.300]  I like to have to kind of break that root ball up at transplant to make it explode.
[57:51.300 --> 57:55.700]  It sounds crazy, but if you get that root ball kind of tight in a small pot, when we
[57:55.700 --> 57:58.880]  transplant it into the next pot, it will really take off.
[57:58.880 --> 58:01.060]  We will really see explosive growth.
[58:01.060 --> 58:06.240]  We will have a really robust and healthy plant from the very beginning with a solid foundation.
[58:06.380 --> 58:09.780]  Let's let these plants grow and get kind of tight in their pots.
[58:09.780 --> 58:12.680]  You may see some roots coming out of the bottom of your container.
[58:12.680 --> 58:13.680]  That is a good thing.
[58:13.680 --> 58:17.160]  If those roots are nice and white, that means you were feeding those roots very well, that
[58:17.160 --> 58:20.880]  your plants are very happy, that they're getting a nice amount of moisture, that they're getting
[58:20.880 --> 58:25.280]  a nice amount of dry time, that everything is going well inside your rhizosphere.
[58:25.280 --> 58:29.160]  Now, if you want to take a look at your roots and see what kind of root development you're
[58:29.160 --> 58:36.120]  working with, don't be afraid to grab a cup or a pot with a plant in it and put your finger
[58:36.120 --> 58:39.760]  over the pot and kind of make a Spock hand where you're spreading your ring finger and
[58:39.760 --> 58:41.200]  your middle finger apart.
[58:41.200 --> 58:45.140]  Put the stock of the plant right between those two fingers and then just flip that pot upside
[58:45.140 --> 58:47.320]  down and give it a little bit of a shake.
[58:47.320 --> 58:51.800]  If you're confident, you can pull that pot off and you can look directly at the root
[58:51.800 --> 58:52.960]  development.
[58:52.960 --> 58:56.240]  If you start lifting that pot off and the dirt starts falling out like crazy and it's
[58:56.240 --> 59:00.120]  not compact and pressed together, push it back in there and just leave it alone.
[59:00.120 --> 59:02.800]  The roots are not developed enough to try this experiment.
[59:02.800 --> 59:06.920]  If you start lifting that pot off and all the dirt stays in one piece and you can see
[59:06.920 --> 59:11.500]  those roots, you can just lift that pot right off and you can take a look at the root development.
[59:11.500 --> 59:14.560]  If you can see those roots wrapped around inside of there and all the dirt and all the
[59:14.560 --> 59:17.600]  roots are tight into one piece, that is what we're aiming for.
[59:17.600 --> 59:19.600]  You are almost ready for transplant.
[59:19.600 --> 59:23.840]  I like to let those get almost root bound to where the plant is almost filling that
[59:23.840 --> 59:28.800]  container with roots to where it is almost panicking time to put that into a new pot.
[59:28.800 --> 59:33.880]  I feel like if we wait that long to put it into our next pot, we get explosive root growth
[59:33.880 --> 59:36.200]  when we transplant it into the next container.
[59:36.200 --> 59:40.320]  I also feel like we get less transplant shock and I feel like the plant is more developed
[59:40.320 --> 59:43.480]  and more prepared to go into its larger container.
[59:43.480 --> 59:48.280]  If you are experienced or confident, grab a plant, flip it upside down and knock the
[59:48.280 --> 59:50.800]  container off of it and see what comes out.
[59:50.800 --> 59:54.600]  If all the dirt goes flying and the roots come unraveling and hanging out, just plant
[59:54.600 --> 59:58.560]  that back in there really carefully and it will be okay if you're careful about it.
[59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.440]  Do your best not to break any of the roots.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.560]  Don't disturb the roots.
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.000]  You can get them back in there.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.320]  While you've got it out, sprinkle a little bit of root inoculant powder on there.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.400]  Sprinkle some Plus Life or some Great White right onto the roots and put it back in there
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:15.080]  and that inoculant will encourage those roots to grow even more quickly than they already
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.080]  were.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.560]  All right, podcast world, I'm going to press pause for a moment.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560]  I need to take a drink.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.300]  I'll probably take a couple of dabs while I'm at it.
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:26.080]  When I get back, we will talk more about developing healthy roots and we will also talk about
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.840]  mycorrhizal fungus.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.800]  Take a dab with me and I will be right back.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.720]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.800]  I am well medicated.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.440]  I am well hydrated.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:38.760]  Let's talk more about healthy roots and mycorrhizal fungus.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:43.680]  Before we transfer our small plants into their forever homes, we want to develop thick, healthy
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680]  white roots.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.720]  We want a big fat root system so that we've got a well-established plant to go into a
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.120]  larger pot.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.240]  A good microbe product will encourage explosive root growth.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.480]  Let's talk about some of the other advantages of our mycorrhizal fungus.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.080]  The first obvious advantage is more roots.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.280]  More roots means our plants can eat more, which means our plants can drink more, which
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:09.040]  means our plants will grow more quickly, which means we will produce more branching, which
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.400]  means we will produce more buds, which is our main goal.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.180]  The first benefit, more roots, which means more productivity overall from our plants.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:23.000]  Another great function of our beneficial fungus is they work as a protective layer or a security
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.860]  guard for our root zone.
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:29.120]  They protect against pathogen problems and illness in our plants.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.440]  There's already a colony of beneficial fungus gathered around the roots.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.760]  If anything else tries to get near it, those colonies say, hey, this is our turf, bro,
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:41.580]  and they fight off any potential pathogens that want to get to your root zone.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:45.680]  Some of our beneficial bacteria work in a similar function as an enzyme.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.400]  It will break down decaying matter.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.280]  It will break down nutrients, and it will make it more bioavailable to our plants so
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.400]  our plants can take that waste and actually turn it into food and consume it and use it
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.400]  to its benefit.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.440]  Now, if you are using a microbe product, I don't recommend that you stop using your enzymes.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.440]  I recommend you use them together.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.600]  Let them team up and create a beautiful environment in your rhizosphere.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.520]  That will also create a lot of diversity.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.740]  You will have multiple things in there breaking down the decaying matter.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.480]  That should really encourage a clean, healthy rhizosphere.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:21.160]  Another function of some of our beneficial bacteria is they aid in the processes that
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.080]  encourage branching and bud set.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.120]  By introducing these beneficial bacteria, you may see more branching and you may see
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.000]  more bud sites in your plants.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.320]  Another great thing that these beneficial bacteria do is they work to increase essential
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.280]  oil production.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.040]  What are essential oils?
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.340]  Essential oils are our terpenes and cannabinoids.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.080]  You can increase the overall production of your plants.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:50.680]  You can increase the overall flavor, aroma, and potency of your plants by using the correct
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.160]  mycorrhizal fungus.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.320]  Now, I try to avoid recommending brand names.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.600]  There are several great mycorrhizal products available at your local growth store.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.400]  There are tons available online.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.960]  I will list a few products that I have had great experience with.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.040]  Of course, I have to recommend Recharge.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.360]  I really like Recharge.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.660]  Recharge made my plants go crazy.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:16.100]  One of the good things about Recharge is it contains dried molasses, which is constantly
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.340]  feeding the microbes.
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.500]  The microbes do need some sort of fuel.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.620]  It's already got fuel in that container.
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:27.140]  Another acceptable myco product is called Xtreme Mycos, and they spell mycos with a
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.140]  K.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.140]  It's a great product.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.400]  It is very affordable.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.880]  You don't have to buy a very expensive myco product.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.900]  If you want something that's affordable, if you're just going to try it out, Xtreme Mycos
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:42.480]  is probably one of the most affordable micro products on the market.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.580]  If you want a liquid micro product, you can get HydroGard from Botanicare.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.460]  I really like Great White.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.420]  Great White is a powdered micro product.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.580]  I like the powders because you can sprinkle them directly onto the roots.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:58.780]  We're going to talk more about that when we get to the transplanting episode, but during
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:02.540]  transplant, I like to sprinkle the powders directly onto the roots and into the hole
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.300]  where I'm transplanting my plant.
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:08.320]  I also sprinkle some right around the outside where it's going to grow.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.420]  These beneficial fungus do not work unless they actually touch the roots of the plant.
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:14.520]  They have to touch the plant.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.520]  That triggers them to germinate and become alive, so they have to come in contact.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.980]  Sprinkle those powders right onto the roots.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.240]  I really like that.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.800]  If you want to stick with liquid and use something similar to the Great White, they make a product
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800]  called Orca.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.820]  Orca is very similar to the Great White.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:33.420]  They took out two specific beneficial funguses, but I don't think you'll ever notice they're
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.540]  missing.
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:39.060]  It's just easier to keep them in a liquid solution without that fungus in there.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:41.540]  Great White also makes a product called MycoChum.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:45.660]  I spoke earlier that I like Recharge because it's got a product that feeds their beneficials
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.540]  that comes in one package.
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:52.460]  The folks that make Great White and Orca have put out a product called MycoChum.
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.540]  That product will feed your beneficials.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:59.260]  It also contains other things that will encourage root growth and healthy plants.
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:04.780]  The folks that make Great White and Orca and MycoChum also make a time-release granule.
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:08.980]  If I'm working in a large container, I like to start that pot with some of the time-release
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.180]  granules already in the soil.
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:15.500]  I'll mix up a large batch of soil with my amendments, with my perlite, with my persolite,
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:20.360]  and then I will just pour a big bag of the dried granules from Great White right across
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.340]  the top of that, mix it right in, put that into the pot and plant right into that.
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.580]  The plants go crazy.
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:30.420]  I feel like giving them plenty of that beneficial bacteria really reduces transplant shock and
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:34.160]  it really encourages explosive root growth.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:40.460]  Another powdered root inoculant I can recommend is the Plus Life from our friends at VegBloom.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:45.020]  Many of the commercial grows in Colorado are running VegBloom, so I would encourage them
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:49.860]  just to add the Plus Life product right along the VegBloom base mix.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:55.100]  I have had great success using the VegBloom product line and adding the Plus Life root
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:06:00.340]  inoculant powder along with that mix, and I've used that in grows of all different sizes.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:05.020]  I've used it in four light grows and I've used it in 400 light grows and I like the
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.820]  way it works in all conditions.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:10.120]  All right, I've got one more product to talk about.
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:13.860]  Another great liquid microbe product is Mammoth Pea.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:16.180]  Mammoth Pea is a great product.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:20.000]  One of the great things about Mammoth Pea is it is highly concentrated.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.060]  Another great thing is you do not have to add anything to feed the microbes.
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:28.440]  Mammoth Pea uses microbes that can sustain themselves off of the carbon in the breakdown
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.860]  happening within the rhizosphere.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:33.940]  That is a list of great microbe products I would recommend.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:40.180]  They vary in application rates, they vary in amount of microbes per container, and they
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:43.420]  are going to vary widely in prices.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.420]  Choose what works best for you and your garden.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.620]  Some of you are going to enjoy the dried powdered forms more.
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:52.100]  Some of you are going to like the liquid forms more.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:55.940]  Some of you simply cannot get the overpriced expensive products.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:59.060]  Some of you will only buy the overpriced expensive products.
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:00.060]  I get it.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.220]  Everybody's got their style.
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.700]  That's why I recommended several products.
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.260]  I have used each of those products.
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:09.080]  I've had great experience with those products and I feel like I can recommend those products
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:13.800]  to you with confidence that they are going to work in your garden under just about any
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.640]  type of conditions or any type of environment.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.560]  Now keep in mind that you may need to feed your microbes.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.440]  I mentioned earlier that some of the microbes do contain other additives that will feed
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.440]  themselves.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:27.360]  I will still encourage you to feed the microbes.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.580]  The microbes want to eat carbs.
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:31.820]  The plants want to eat carbs.
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.480]  Add a little bit of carbohydrates.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:38.000]  The carbohydrates will give your plants energy and the carbohydrates will feed your microbes.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.800]  It's a win-win situation.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.200]  Don't overdose the carbs trying to feed them both.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.880]  I generally suggest starting off with half of the recommended dose.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:50.460]  If you buy a bottle of a carbohydrate product and it says feed 40, I recommend you start
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.800]  off with 20.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.800]  Pay attention.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:55.840]  If the plants seem happy, you don't need to increase the dosage.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.960]  If you want to, you can increase the dosage until you see the plants react poorly.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.560]  That's what a lot of growers like to do.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.600]  Push it as hard as we can and then back off.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.440]  That's how you learn the limits of a plant.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.940]  But if you're a newer grower, if you're not super experienced, just feed it half of that
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:13.320]  recommended dosage and the plants will be receiving that nutrition even if you don't
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.880]  see anything happening.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.400]  Be careful overdoing it with a carbohydrate product late in flower because it will make
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.560]  your buds burn like a rock.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.440]  They'll just turn into a charcoal briquette and they won't burn very well if you overdo
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:29.720]  it with the molasses or a carbohydrate product late in bloom.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.720]  Now earlier I mentioned MycoCharm.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.880]  If you want a quality product to feed your microbes and encourage microbe growth and
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.720]  encourage root growth and overall plant health, check out MycoCharm from the same folks that
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.040]  make the Great White product line.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:49.000]  Now when it comes to feeding your microbes, I recommend more frequent, smaller doses.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.920]  Now the first time I introduce microbes to my feeding regimen, I usually give it what
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.240]  the bottle says.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:09:00.240]  If the container says one gram or 25 milliliters, I will add that to my nutrient solution and
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.800]  I will water that right in.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.680]  My goal is to get a good start of a colonization of microbes.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.400]  I just want to give it a good head start.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.320]  Just put them in there and get them going.
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:15.560]  Then my subsequent waterings, I will probably give it half of the recommended dosage, but
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.080]  those products usually say to water it in once a week.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:24.160]  Instead of doing it once a week, I'll reduce the dosage to half and water it every time
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:30.160]  I water for a couple of weeks to build a nice solid colony of beneficial fungus in
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.160]  my rhizosphere.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:35.320]  Now, after I transplant into my three gallon pots and I get the root zone cranking and
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:41.360]  I've got a nice fat root ball in that pot, I will start reducing my frequency of inoculant
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.360]  feedings.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:47.280]  In a commercial grow, when I'm in flower, I generally feed Plus Life once a week and
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.360]  that's enough through the flowering cycle.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.760]  Once I've got the roots nice and healthy and everything is developed, I will generally
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.480]  use the Plus Life to keep problems away.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:00.600]  It keeps the root zone nice and clean, a nice enzymatic product and a nice mycorrhizal product.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:05.080]  Again, we'll work to keep the roots clean and healthy and happy and pathogen free.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:10.720]  So I'll just continue the once a week feeding just to keep everybody clean and happy.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.400]  It's sort of like plant probiotics.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.400]  It's like giving probiotics to a plant.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:18.120]  If you take probiotics for your gut health, it just has a good, you've got a good gut
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.120]  biome.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:25.000]  We're making a good gut biome for our plants by feeding them probiotics, which are actually
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.640]  mycorrhizal fungus when it comes to the plant world.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.120]  All right, podcast world, I've got one more thing to talk about and then we're going to
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.380]  start wrapping up this episode.
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:38.660]  When you were listening or reading or learning about mycorrhizal fungus, you will hear three
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:43.120]  words quite frequently that basically mean the same thing.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.560]  You will hear the word inoculated, you will hear the word vaccinated, and you will also
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.720]  hear the word infected.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:56.400]  These words all basically mean that the root zone shows the presence of a mycorrhizal fungus.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.280]  We inoculate our root zone with a fungus by adding it ourselves.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.160]  We have now inoculated it.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.220]  Once that takes hold, it is basically vaccinated.
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:08.600]  Once it travels across the root zone, it is infected.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.800]  That is a positive thing.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.400]  I know they sound like scary words, but in this situation, all three of those words are
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.760]  positive things that we want happening within our rhizosphere.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:24.400]  When you hear the word inoculated, vaccinated, or infected, keep in mind, it just means basically
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.800]  the presence of mycorrhizal fungus within our root zone.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.500]  All right, podcast world, that is my talk about continuing small, healthy veg plants.
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.560]  That is also my lesson on mycorrhizal fungus.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.740]  I want to thank you guys for listening to this episode.
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:42.040]  If you are interested in learning a lot more about mycorrhizal fungi, I highly recommend
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:46.520]  a podcast called Cannabis Cultivation and Sciences by Tad Hussey.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:52.400]  Tad recently had Jim Egan on the show, and they do a deep dive into mycorrhizal fungus,
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.520]  and I highly recommend the episode.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.520]  It was great timing.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.640]  I had already planned this episode to come out this week.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.560]  I was writing this episode, and then Monday, this episode popped up.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.560]  It was beautifully timed.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:07.080]  You've got a nice introduction from me, and then Tad takes it really deep.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:11.600]  If you're going to listen to Tad's podcast, I highly recommend a notebook and a pen.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.800]  You are going to learn a lot about cultivation.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.880]  You will learn a lot about organic cultivation.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.560]  You'll learn about sustainability.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.920]  You will learn about permaculture, and you will certainly learn about mycorrhizal fungi.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:28.920]  Again, the podcast is called Cannabis Cultivation and Sciences, and I highly recommend it if
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.480]  you want to expand your cultivation knowledge.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.600]  Podcast world, that's all I've got for you for this episode.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.280]  I want to thank you again for listening.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.800]  Again, if you feel like this episode was educational, informative, or entertaining, and you would

[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:12.500]  All right, podcast world.
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.980]  I will be back Monday with a fresh new episode.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:18.460]  We will talk about transplanting our small plants into their forever homes.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:20.140]  I look forward to that episode.
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:21.900]  I can't wait to join you there.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:25.180]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Hot Saucerman.
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:28.740]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.340]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.940]  It's time for episode 370 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:37.100]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:41.940]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:48.060]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.740]  You know I like to start the show off by letting you know what I've been smoking.
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:55.940]  Today I've been taking dabs of strawberry diesel ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.100]  Farms.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:01.620]  This stuff smells like skunky strawberries and just funky fruit.
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:05.740]  If you dab it at a nice low temperature, it tastes like strawberries and cream with
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.620]  a hint of skunky gassiness in the background.
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:09.740]  It is very delicious.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:13.260]  It's almost like eating some strawberry shortcake at the gas station.
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.040]  That's what it kind of smells like to me.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:23.020]  The lab test on the front here says 72.3% THC with a total cannabinoid content of 83.9%.
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:24.460]  I really like this concentrate.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:25.700]  It tastes delicious.
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:29.300]  The high is great and the texture and consistency are beautiful.
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:33.140]  There's just enough terp sauce in here and it's got some nice chunky crystals.
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:35.260]  I am really happy with that purchase.
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.980]  Great concentrate from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:41.620]  All right, my next order of business is to give a couple of people some shout outs.
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.620]  I want to give a huge shout out to Brett Gorman.
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:48.460]  How about a giant shout out to Riley Hansen, a big shout out to Mike O'Panther, a big thank
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:52.940]  you shout out to Sam, and also a giant fist bump and a shout out to Aldridge.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.460]  Thank you guys for the continued Patreon support.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.980]  All right, podcast world.
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.860]  This is going to be another grow lesson.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:03.300]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.000]  That series starts at episode 351.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.720]  In this series of lessons, we started by setting a goal for our grow.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.860]  Then we decided a good place for our grow.
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:15.180]  Then we acquired the appropriate equipment and set it up.
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:19.060]  Then we either acquired seeds or clones and we got those growing.
[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:23.940]  At this point in my grow lessons, we should have small plants that are approximately 8
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:26.660]  to 12 inches tall and they are in small pots.
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.940]  They are probably in either beer cups or four inch pots or maybe six or eight inch net pots.
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.300]  We've got small plants.
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.980]  They should be nice and healthy at this point.
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:37.380]  They should have nice branching coming out of them.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.660]  They should not have any bugs or any powdery mildew.
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:45.500]  Hopefully at this point, we don't have any burned leaves or any signs of deficiencies.
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:50.260]  Hopefully we have got a nice, developed, thriving root system to work with.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.660]  Now, if most of those things are accurate, we've got a nice healthy plant.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:56.420]  It is growing, it's branching, it looks healthy, it's thriving.
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:59.460]  It's not struggling and we've got a nice healthy root system.
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:04.180]  It is time to transplant our small plants into our larger pot, our finishing pot, and
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:06.060]  start the large veg phase.
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:09.620]  Now these plants will probably finish out in these pots unless you want to transplant
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.940]  one more time into an even larger pot.
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:15.180]  I like to go from the small pot into my finishing pot.
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:20.820]  I'm generally going to go into a three gallon or a five gallon or a seven gallon in an indoor garden.
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.620]  You guys may choose to go larger.
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:27.140]  You may want to go from the small six inch net pot maybe to a one gallon, then maybe
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:30.980]  into your 20 or 30 gallon if you're going to do something like that.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:35.340]  I talked in a previous episode about why it's a good idea to use a smaller container for
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:36.540]  smaller plants.
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:41.020]  We don't need to water this giant area when we've got a tiny plant right in the middle.
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:44.900]  So if you're going to go to like a 20 or 30 gallon pot, you may want to go from the cup
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:49.300]  to maybe a one gallon, maybe a three gallon, then later on transplant that into your 20
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.300]  or 30.
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.860]  It gets challenging when you go to transplant larger plants.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.180]  If you're not experienced with it, you can cause damage.
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:57.420]  You need to lay that larger plant on its side.
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:58.420]  You need to remove that pot.
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.880]  Then you need to pot a much larger plant.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.940]  It does get difficult, but I have faith in you that you can do it.
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.780]  If you choose to transplant twice, just be careful.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:09.620]  In this lesson, we're going to focus on transplanting one time.
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:13.380]  We're going to go from this small beer cup or our four inch or our six inch net pot,
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:18.300]  or maybe an eight inch pot, and we're going to pot into a three or a five or a seven gallon
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.300]  pot for my example.
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.860]  All right, let's talk a little bit about pots and soil.
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:28.060]  I did a long episode about choosing pots and soil, but let's do a brief recap.
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:31.840]  I like to use the plastic nursery pots in a home grow.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.860]  In a commercial facility, I like to use a root pot, one of the fabric pots.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:40.500]  In most applications, I am using a three gallon pot.
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:44.740]  You can use whatever kind of pots make you happy, as long as it's going to get you to
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.180]  your goal.
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:50.900]  The thing I find most important is to make sure that whatever container you use, that
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.720]  it has plenty of holes for drainage.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.140]  Make sure that when you water this plant, the excess water has some way to escape from
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.020]  the bottom of that pot.
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.720]  The nursery pots have plenty of holes in them already.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:06.160]  The fabric pots will drain naturally just because they're mesh.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.440]  Those work perfectly.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.520]  If you're going to use a Home Depot bucket or something like that, make sure you drill
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.560]  plenty of drainage holes in your container.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:17.780]  Now let's talk briefly about soil or a soilless mix.
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:20.780]  You don't have to buy a really expensive soil.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:26.880]  If you're going to feed your plants with bottled nutrients, you can buy an inert medium.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:32.680]  You don't need a soil or a soilless mix with a lot of nutrients and a lot of stuff in there.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:36.620]  You're going to be on top of fertilizing these plants with your bottled nutrients, so we
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:40.740]  don't need to pay extra money for a soil or a soilless mix that's got a bunch of stuff
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:41.740]  in there.
[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:44.680]  If you're going to give us the opportunity to burn our plants because we're going to
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:48.960]  add them to a soil that's got nutrients in it, then we're going to add bottled nutrients
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.200]  on top of that.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.320]  We do run the risk of over fertilizing the plants in that situation.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.760]  We don't really need an over fertilized soil or soilless mix.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:01.840]  We need something more inert, maybe something with some mycos or some beneficial fungus
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:02.840]  in there.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.840]  That would be advantageous, but we don't really need a lot of nutrients.
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:11.180]  Whatever medium you choose to purchase, I recommend you get something with a lot of
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:15.220]  aeration in it, either a lot of perlite or a lot of persolite.
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:20.540]  If it doesn't come with plenty of aeration product already in it, buy a bag of perlite
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.420]  and amend it yourself.
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:26.580]  The amount of perlite or persolite you're going to need to add to your soil or soilless
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:32.220]  mix will depend on the fluffiness and the amount of aeration in that medium when you
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.220]  purchase it.
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.800]  I'm not sure what you're going to purchase, so I'm not sure what to recommend as a ratio
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.200]  of how much perlite.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.840]  I like it fluffy.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:46.720]  When I'm working with cocoa, I mix three bags of cocoa and one five-gallon bucket of perlite
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:49.920]  and one five-gallon bucket of persolite.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.860]  That gives me about 25 to 30 three-gallon pots worth of material to work with.
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:58.440]  You guys can reduce that recipe as needed for your garden.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.600]  If I were working with soil or a soilless mix, I might not use as much perlite.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:05.300]  I may reduce that perlite by about half.
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:10.700]  You don't need, in my opinion, I don't need as much aeration in soil and soilless mix
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.220]  as I do in the cocoa.
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:17.420]  I feel like the cocoa holds a lot more water, so it also pushes out a lot more air and it
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:19.060]  kind of crushes the plants a little more.
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:21.620]  It gets heavier because it's got so much water in there.
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:25.940]  The soil and soilless mix doesn't hold as much water, so it doesn't get as heavy and
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:28.060]  it doesn't crush the roots as much.
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:29.580]  You don't need as much perlite.
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.060]  Maybe go half as much.
[01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:35.700]  Maybe if you're doing three bags of soil, do half of a five-gallon bucket of persolite
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:38.200]  and half of a five-gallon bucket of perlite.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.480]  If you guys aren't going to buy the persolite, I understand it's more expensive.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.640]  It's another product to buy.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.940]  You will get by with just using perlite.
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:46.840]  Perlite is just fine for this situation.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:49.880]  If you only want to buy the one product, that will be fine.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:54.200]  Three bags of soil and maybe one bag of perlite for this application.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.320]  I know I work in larger batches than a lot of people.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.480]  If you want to reduce this recipe for a smaller garden, I think they sell the bags of soil
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:05.820]  in 1.75 cubic yards is what I think most of those bags of dirt are, or at least the bags
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:09.500]  of cocoa I was buying are 1.77 cubic yards.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:17.340]  If you buy 1.77 cubic yards of dirt, mix that with a third of a five-gallon bucket of perlite.
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:21.060]  Just fill the bucket up about a third, maybe halfway if you want to go hard.
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:25.340]  Then mix that in really well with your soil so that it's nicely evenly mixed in there
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:28.940]  with everything else so that you just see the little white spots everywhere.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:32.800]  Then you know you've got plenty of aeration throughout your entire root zone.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:38.760]  Now while we're mixing up perlite into our soil, why not mix in some sort of root inoculant powder?
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:43.100]  In a previous episode, I talked all about mycorrhizal fungi.
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:49.340]  Let's add a mycorrhizal product to our mix right now and get it distributed all throughout the soil.
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.300]  Something like the Great White Granulars would work perfectly.
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.460]  You can use Great White Shark on its own.
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:55.900]  Just sprinkle it in there right now.
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:58.500]  You can use Plus Life right now.
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:03.060]  Any sort of powdered mycoproduct would work wonderfully right now.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:05.660]  Sprinkle it right into the dirt as you're mixing it up.
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:11.420]  So I feel like that's a great way to segue into actually starting to do the transplanting process.
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:12.540]  We've got healthy plants.
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:13.860]  We've got a container.
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:16.240]  We've got a good soil or soilless mix.
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.500]  It's well aerated.
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.660]  We've put a mycoproduct in there.
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.740]  Now let's actually get to work.
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:26.100]  Step number one, you guys, is always find the Bluetooth speaker and put on the Grow
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:27.740]  From Your Heart podcast.
[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.780]  It helps you grow.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:33.180]  It makes the plants happy, and it puts you in a good mood to create a positive garden
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.180]  environment.
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:37.420]  So step number one, find the Bluetooth speaker or find your earbuds.
[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:38.780]  Get your earbuds in.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.100]  Get hooked up with the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:45.360]  That is going to make your garden grow so much more rapidly.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.020]  It's going to make you grow more rapidly.
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.260]  It's going to make everything go better.
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:51.580]  So step number one, find the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:54.200]  Get it at an acceptable volume and get that going in the growth.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.660]  Step number two, get some rubber gloves.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.780]  I often overlook this step.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.760]  We should always be wearing gloves.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.700]  If we're coming in contact with the mycos, if we're coming in contact with the roots,
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:08.380]  if we're coming in contact with bottled nutrients, we should be wearing gloves.
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:13.180]  Also, if you're going to be sprinkling those mycoproducts over your topsoil just all willy-nilly,
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:15.620]  maybe you might want to consider some sort of a mask.
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:18.920]  We don't really want to breathe in microbe products.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.300]  So we've got the podcast on.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:21.300]  We're gloved up.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:22.300]  We've got a face mask on.
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.820]  You got your dreadlocks tied up.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:27.460]  Hopefully you're nicely medicated if that's appropriate wherever you work or wherever
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:28.460]  you're growing.
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:30.500]  Now let's actually get to business here.
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:34.040]  We need to fill our container, whatever size container we chose.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:36.960]  We need to fill it with our well-mixed medium.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.020]  We've got our soilless mix.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.580]  We've got our cocoa.
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.620]  Hopefully we've got a bunch of perlite in there.
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:43.580]  Hopefully we added a mycoproduct to there.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:44.580]  We've got it all mixed up.
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.820]  Now it's ready to go into a container.
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:51.420]  I like to fill my containers by using a smaller container just to scoop dirt out of the bag
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:55.660]  or whatever container it's in and just dump it right into the pot that it's going into.
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:56.780]  Just fill it up.
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.400]  Fill it up most of the way.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.820]  If you're filling up a three gallon, five gallon, or seven gallon pot, fill it up most
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:07.420]  of the way, but leave yourself about an inch and a half or maybe two inches at the top
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:10.980]  where you don't fill it all the way up, all the way to the brim.
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:14.980]  Leave yourself about inch and a half, two inches so that when we water, we've got some
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:16.980]  room to put water in the pot.
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:20.200]  You don't want to pour water on the pot and watch it run right off the top.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.320]  You don't want to have to stand there and pour water really slowly to where you can
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.960]  get that whole quarter or half or gallon of water into the pot so you can water it appropriately.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.620]  I like to be able to just splash a gallon of water on top of a seven gallon pot and
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:33.840]  just watch it saturate that whole top area.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.540]  Then you can just walk away and do the next pot.
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:39.960]  If you fill it up too far, you got to just stand there and pour it slowly to where the
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.680]  water saturates into the medium and drains down a little bit.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.900]  Then you can pour a little more.
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:45.900]  Leave yourself some space.
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:49.580]  Also, in the future, we may choose to top dress these plants.
[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:51.400]  You may want to add some worm castings.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.260]  You may want to add some bat guano.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:58.080]  You may just add some fresh soil with some charged up nutrients in it to the top layer.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.920]  Leave yourself some room so that you've got options and you've got watering space.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:06.740]  As you are filling your container, pack your medium in there slightly tight.
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:10.280]  You don't want it packed real snug, but you don't want it fluffy and loose.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:14.780]  We want to make the roots work to dig down into the dirt and have some more to grow and
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:18.720]  kind of do a little exercise to get in there, but we also don't want to suffocate them and
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:22.360]  make it so hard that the roots simply can't grow into the medium.
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.520]  You have to pack it a little bit, but don't crush it so tight to where the roots can't
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.520]  even grow.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:31.700]  Now, if you packed it too loosely, you will notice on the first couple of waterings, you'll
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.380]  just get a giant hole in the center.
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:34.380]  All the dirt will just cave in.
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:37.380]  You'll create a hole in the middle and then you'll have to repack it, put more dirt in
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:38.860]  there, then rewater it.
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:39.860]  That's okay.
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:40.860]  You didn't mess up.
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:43.040]  You just should have gone a little harder in the first place.
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.040]  You will learn.
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.520]  If you go too hard, the roots just aren't going to grow.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:49.980]  If you go too soft, the water's just going to fall right through and you will definitely
[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:50.980]  get indicators.
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:53.980]  Fill your container, pack it slightly tight.
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.860]  I usually just use the palm of my hand and I give it just a few pats.
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:00.380]  I throw in just a few scoops of dirt just to give myself a few inches of dirt and then
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.220]  I just pat it in and then I throw in some more dirt and then I just pat it in.
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:04.660]  You can hear me just tapping on the table here.
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:05.660]  It's not that hard.
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.700]  I'm just patting it down, just getting the dirt nice and even in there.
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:11.140]  Then I just pour more dirt on top of it and just pat it down.
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:14.700]  I'd rather pour some in and then pack it down and then pour some in and pack it down instead
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:16.640]  of fill it up and then try to pack all that down.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:21.520]  I feel like that's not really as productive as packing each little layer.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.240]  Pour some dirt in there, pack it down, pour some dirt, pack it down.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:27.680]  Get yourself up to about an inch and a half or two inches to the top.
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:29.600]  Now here's where it gets fun.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.560]  We have got our three, our five or seven gallon pot filled with our appropriate mix and it
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.720]  is leveled off and we've got about an inch and a half or two inches of space so that
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.720]  we can add water or top dress later in the future.
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:47.240]  Now in the very center of that pot, we need to create a space for our transplanted plant.
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:51.840]  We need to create a little hole in which to place our small root ball.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.180]  The way I like to do it is find the middle of that topsoil and just dig out about a fist
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:57.640]  size worth of dirt.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:58.640]  Just take out about just a fist.
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.640]  I've got a pretty big fist.
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.620]  So just take out about a fist size worth of dirt right in the center of that topsoil.
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:09.060]  Then whatever size pot my plant is already in, say I'm in a beer cup or maybe I'm in
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:14.860]  a six inch net pot, I will take a beer cup or a six inch net pot and I will dig a hole
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:19.520]  in my new pot soil right at the top, right in the center and I will actually plant the
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.660]  cup in that hole.
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:24.180]  I will dig a hole perfectly to where that cup will fit.
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:28.520]  Then I will backfill dirt around that cup, kind of snug.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:32.860]  Then I will pull the cup or the six inch net pot out of that made hole.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:38.260]  Now I have got a perfect template that is the exact shape of the incoming root ball
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:40.100]  from my small veg plant.
[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:42.160]  So I basically leveled off the dirt.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.260]  I dug out a hole.
[01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:45.660]  I put the previous pot in that hole.
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:46.840]  I backfilled it.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.580]  Then I just pulled that pot right out.
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:53.780]  So I made an impression, a template, just a little gap for the next plant to fit perfectly
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:54.780]  into.
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:58.060]  So you've got a top layer of soil with this little round hole perfectly waiting, just
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:59.980]  chilling, waiting for a pot to go in it.
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:05.320]  Now our next step is to pot our small veg plant into that hole.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.860]  But before we do that, you know what I'm going to recommend?
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:11.180]  Let's sprinkle a little mycopowder right into that hole.
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:14.060]  Our fresh exposed roots are going to go right there.
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:16.240]  Let's just sprinkle some mycopowder right there.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.300]  Let's just give it some love, give it a boost, give it a headstart.
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:21.660]  That's just like laying out some cookies for Santa.
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:22.660]  Just get it nice and ready.
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:24.520]  Put some mycopowder right in the hole.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:30.580]  Now our next challenge will be to get the small plant out of that small pot.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:35.160]  Hopefully it has grown really tight into your beer cup or really tight into your six inch
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.160]  net pot.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.420]  It is nicely root bound.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:41.100]  There's a lot of root mass in that container, so it's going to take a little effort to get
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.580]  it out.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:46.140]  The way I do it is I make a Spock hand.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:48.780]  I've got my first finger and my middle finger together.
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:51.420]  I've got my ring finger and my pinky finger together.
[01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:57.220]  I place the stick of the plant between my middle finger and my ring finger, sticking
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:59.060]  up.
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:01.840]  The root ball, the soil is in my palm.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.300]  Then I flip it upside down.
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:08.660]  The plant is hanging upside down and I'm holding on to the root ball with my Spock hand.
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:11.100]  I do that in my left hand because I don't need as much coordination.
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:12.220]  It can just stay there.
[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:18.660]  Then I take my right hand and I just squeeze the beer cup or the six inch net pot.
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:20.260]  Just squeeze it all around.
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:21.860]  Just squeeze it.
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:24.780]  If you've ever rolled a joint too tight and you're trying to loosen the joint, it's the
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:25.780]  same idea.
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:28.140]  We're just trying to loosen the dirt out of that cup.
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:29.820]  Just squeeze all around it.
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:30.820]  Just squeeze it.
[01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:31.820]  That's all you really got to do.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:32.820]  You'll feel it loosening up.
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:35.540]  You can squeeze it and work it to the left and right just a little bit.
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:38.340]  You'll feel how to loosen the dirt inside of that pot once you start doing it.
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:41.140]  All you're trying to do is loosen the dirt so that it will fall out.
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:42.820]  Give it a little shake and it's going to fall out.
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:46.500]  You're going to have an exposed root zone in your hand now.
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:47.980]  It's okay.
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.980]  Hopefully when it came out, it all stayed together in one big chunk.
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:52.060]  Hopefully you've taken good care of it.
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:53.460]  You've properly watered it.
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:57.060]  You've given it proper dry time and the roots have developed nice and fat in there.
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:58.540]  It's all just one chunk.
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:00.540]  If it came out as a mess, that's okay.
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:03.780]  We're just going to pot that whole mess into that hole that we already made and it will
[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:06.020]  be just fine.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:11.820]  Once you get the root ball out of the container, you already know what I'm going to say.
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:13.420]  Sprinkle a little mycos on it.
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:14.420]  Why not?
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:15.580]  We've got exposed roots.
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:16.960]  Those roots love mycos.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.580]  Those mycos are activated by touching roots.
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:20.620]  Sprinkle them on there.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:24.100]  Give it as much myco powder as you can afford to sprinkle on there at this time.
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:25.300]  Just give it a nice little coating.
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:27.740]  Just infect it with root inoculant powder.
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:33.300]  Then we want to, if it came out in a mess, you need to gently place it in that hole.
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:36.460]  Get as much of that original dirt as you can in there.
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:37.460]  Set the root ball down.
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:42.660]  Put some, so maybe put the, if they're dangling long roots, set the dangly roots in there.
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:44.220]  Put a little dirt on top of it.
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:45.500]  Lower the plant in a little more.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.660]  Put some dirt on top of it.
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:49.620]  Lower it in a little bit more so that you don't bind those roots up.
[01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:51.180]  We're trying to give those roots space.
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:55.020]  We don't want to just drop them right in there and smother them with fresh dirt.
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:58.700]  So if they came apart, keep them apart when you're putting them in there.
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:01.180]  Then backfill it with all the dirt from that container.
[01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:03.860]  You should have enough dirt there to level everything off.
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:08.200]  If you lost some dirt during the movement, just grab some more dirt out of your mix and
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:10.540]  just top it to where you have a nice even layer.
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:11.540]  Kind of pack it in.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:12.540]  Not super tight.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:15.860]  Just tight enough to keep that plant staying straight upright.
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:20.260]  Now if it came out nice and smooth, now we've got another option.
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:25.060]  If it came out nice and smooth and you feel like those roots are perfect and they aren't
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:29.500]  super bound, but they're growing well, you can just set still, sprinkle some micos on
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:30.500]  it.
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:33.820]  Then you can set that perfect root ball right into that perfect hole.
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:37.680]  Maybe sprinkle a little bit of dirt on top of it and pat it in and you've got a beautifully
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:42.740]  transplanted plant that didn't get any shock or any stress whatsoever during the transplanting
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:43.980]  process.
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:48.400]  Our other option, when you take it out of the small container, if it is really bound
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:53.200]  up in there, if you see a lot of white roots and it is growing in a circle and it's getting
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:58.200]  spiraled, you do have the option to kind of break those roots up just a little bit.
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:02.320]  The way I do it is I hold it with my left hand and I take my middle finger and my ring
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:06.560]  finger on my right hand and I come straight up from the bottom of that root ball and I
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:09.680]  just plow my fingers through it and just pull it apart.
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.160]  Just spread it right in half.
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:12.340]  You're going to tear some roots up.
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:13.920]  You're going to mess some stuff up.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:18.320]  If you've got a nice, healthy root system, that is only going to encourage growth.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.240]  You're spreading it out a little bit.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:23.560]  Then when you set it in that template hole that you've got, the roots will spread out
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:27.240]  a little bit and instead of growing in a perfect spiral, they're going to take off a little
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.720]  bit for you and fill that pot.
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:34.420]  Either way, sprinkle mycos on the roots on that root ball that you pull out of the pot.
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:35.960]  Sprinkle mycos on there.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:38.320]  Always sprinkle some mycos into the hole.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:42.920]  Then gently place that small root ball into that fresh hole and just cover it with dirt
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:43.920]  gently.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:47.640]  Again, don't pack it down too tightly, but pack it down tight enough to where you know
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:51.400]  it's not going to cave in when we water it and that it's tight enough to give that plant
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.560]  enough support to stay upright.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.720]  You will know on the first watering if you did not do it tightly enough.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:01.900]  If you didn't do it tight enough, you're just going to need to add more medium.
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:03.800]  Now that plant is basically transplanted.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:08.300]  I recommend you label that plant at this time before you forget.
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:11.920]  The next step is to move that plant under the appropriate light.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.720]  I should also mention you may need a saucer or some sort of a catch tray underneath your
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:17.800]  plants.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:19.800]  When we water these plants, we expect to have some runoff.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:23.680]  Now is a good time to consider placing your plant on a saucer or some sort of a catch
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680]  tray.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.080]  We've got the trays down.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.400]  Let's talk about the lighting in which we're going to place these plants under.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.200]  You can use T5s for your fresh transplants.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.720]  You can get the T5s really close.
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:40.160]  You can get those T5 lights three, maybe four inches away from your canopy.
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:44.160]  Just make sure that you adjust them every day because the plants are going to grow rapidly
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.960]  and they will grow into those lights if you don't pay attention.
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:51.600]  You can also use ceramic metal halide for your fresh transplants.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.200]  I like the 315s or the 630s.
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:58.280]  You need to keep those a little bit further away than the T5s, probably about a foot,
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:00.240]  maybe 18 inches away.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:04.920]  LEDs are very brand and power specific.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:09.600]  I would follow the recommendation from the manufacturer on your LED.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:14.140]  I don't have enough experience with your LED to know what it's going to do to the plants.
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:18.420]  There are so many vendors, so many different makes and models that it is hard to give
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:20.500]  advice for LED lighting.
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:25.700]  But you certainly can use LEDs through the entire cycle and you can absolutely use them
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:28.380]  right now for your fresh transplants.
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:33.620]  You can also use metal halide or high pressure sodium, also known as high intensity discharge
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:34.980]  lighting.
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:39.500]  If you are going to use high intensity discharge lighting, pay close attention to how the plants
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.780]  are reacting.
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:46.860]  If you're using a 400, you can probably get 12 to 18 inches away and not have any problems.
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:52.040]  If you were using a 600, you could probably get 18 inches away and not have any problems.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:56.080]  If you're using a thousand watt light, you may want to start off about two feet away
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:01.940]  from the canopy, maybe even more as you start introducing these plants to that larger light.
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:03.860]  As time goes on, you can get closer.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:05.700]  They will grow closer to the light.
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:10.340]  But when you are introducing young plants to large lights, pay attention to how they
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:11.340]  react.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:12.340]  We don't want to burn these lights.
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:13.500]  We don't want to stress them.
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:14.500]  I said lights.
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:15.500]  We don't want to burn the plants.
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.500]  We don't want to stress the plants.
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:19.620]  We don't want to put them into any kind of shock right as we transplant them.
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:20.620]  This is a critical time.
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:22.980]  We are trying to put them into turbo mode right now.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:24.460]  We don't want to slow them down.
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.560]  We don't want to punish them and put them on timeout.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.380]  We want to give them encouragement to take off right now.
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:31.660]  So we have our plants under the appropriate light.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:35.220]  We've got our light the appropriate distance away from our canopy.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:40.020]  Let's talk about the amount of light hours we are going to give these plants.
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.580]  I've talked earlier about lighting schedules.
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:45.740]  And apparently in a previous episode, I did make a mistake.
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:50.220]  At some point I said something about 18 on and 16 off or something like that.
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:53.940]  Somebody said, your light cycle will always add up to 24 hours.
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:58.980]  If my light cycle I said didn't add up to 24 hours, I was too high to be doing a podcast
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:00.540]  and I do apologize.
[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:04.380]  Honestly, when you talk as much as I do, I think you're going to make a few mistakes
[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:08.980]  and I encourage you guys to let me know when I make a mistake so that I can correct it.
[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:10.300]  And I do apologize.
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:13.020]  Somebody said I did make a light cycle mistake.
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:14.420]  I apologize for that.
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:16.980]  Allow me to correct myself in this part.
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:21.820]  There are several cycles that work very well for our veg plants.
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:25.700]  One common cycle is 24 hours on and zero hours off.
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:31.060]  I mainly recommend this if you have mother plants that tend to auto flower on you or
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.780]  when you were cutting clones.
[01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:36.500]  Our next option is 20 hours on and four hours off.
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:39.020]  I like to give the plants a few hours to sleep.
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:42.060]  This also gives my equipment four hours to rest.
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:47.340]  When you're running a bedroom with 25 lights, that is a hundred hours of lights that you
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.340]  don't have to run.
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:50.260]  That's a lot of electricity that you save.
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:53.500]  You're also not paying for as much cooling and humidity control.
[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.060]  It makes a big difference.
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:58.220]  So the 20 on and four off is good for your equipment.
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.180]  Also, the plants get to take a nap.
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:02.340]  Who doesn't want to take a nap?
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:05.740]  I feel like the roots do a lot of activity in the dark cycle.
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:08.820]  I feel like the plants grow a lot in the dark cycle.
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.940]  Sugars are processed in the dark cycle.
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:13.340]  So 20 on, four off is great.
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:18.500]  That will make any plants that may want to auto flower in a lesser cycle, that will prevent
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:22.900]  them from auto flowering and it will also give you maximum growth and it will keep your
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:25.220]  mother plants really happy.
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:29.620]  Another very common veg cycle is 18 on and six off.
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:35.700]  This is very common because it very closely mimics the outdoor cycle of the natural light.
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:39.500]  Another option is 16 on and eight off.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.700]  This is very similar to outdoors as well.
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:47.380]  The reason people will adjust between the 16 and eight and the 18 and six is because
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:53.860]  some plants will try to flower on their own with the 16 hours of daylight once they get
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:56.140]  large enough and once they get root bound.
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:59.600]  Also, I feel like more light is more energy.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.840]  Light is the number one desired source of energy and nutrient for our plants.
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:07.680]  So why not maximize the light input?
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:11.720]  Of course, some plants will only take so much light per day and they'll just shut themselves
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:16.760]  down but I don't think you're going to overload them with light in a small grow room with
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:17.760]  a grow light.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.680]  So again, our options are 24 hours on and zero hours off.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:24.960]  I wouldn't really recommend that for these large veg plants.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:28.480]  The next option is 20 hours on and four hours off.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:31.440]  In a commercial environment, that is what I would do.
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:35.240]  In another environment, you can go 18 on and six off.
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:37.020]  That is very acceptable.
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:39.800]  Another option is 16 on and eight off.
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:41.460]  That is very acceptable.
[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:47.080]  Another thing I found advantageous of the 20 on and four off is when I do induce that
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:53.040]  12, 12 flowering cycle, those plants really notice a change in photo period and they really
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.400]  go into flower really quickly.
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:58.080]  So that's something that I found has helped quite a bit.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:01.360]  Any of those light cycles will work for your veg plants.
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.680]  Find what works best for you.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:09.360]  You will find pros and cons to each of those options based on your environment, your location,
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:11.600]  your setup, and your overall grow.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:15.800]  You're going to have to find things through trial and error when it comes to growing.
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.960]  Try some things out.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.360]  See what works best for you and your plants.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:23.360]  Ultimately, it's going to come down to what works best for your plants.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:24.360]  They are the boss.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:28.440]  All right, at this point, our small veg plants have been up-potted.
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.560]  They are now large veg plants.
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:32.360]  We've got them in their forever pots.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.080]  We've got them underneath a good light.
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.280]  We have got that light on a solid schedule.
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.260]  We have got our pots sitting on a saucer or some sort of a catch tray.
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:44.520]  It is now time to water our new transplants.
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:48.880]  I recommend feeding these transplants with a strong vegetative nutrient.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.560]  If you've got a bottle that says veg, that's the one you need right now.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.140]  You need something with a good NPK ratio.
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:41:00.320]  You need more N than you do P and K. You need a high N ratio for this time.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.960]  Also, I would recommend a myco product.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.240]  If you haven't put plenty of powdered mycos in there, I recommend a mycorrhizal fungal
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:11.600]  product that is in liquid form that you can feed right in your nutrient solution right
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:12.600]  now.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:13.600]  Mix that in.
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.760]  Also, a small dash of carbs.
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:18.560]  A little bit of carbohydrates will help feed those mycos.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:21.960]  Also, it will give the plants a little bit of energy.
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:24.640]  I also recommend a little bit of cow mag at this time.
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:28.400]  The plants are big enough to take cow mag, give them a little bit of a boost.
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:31.760]  I would also recommend a little bit of enzymes at this time.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:32.920]  That will speed everything up.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:35.200]  It will help keep the root zone nice and clean.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.700]  The myco products and the enzymes will work together.
[01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:39.480]  They will make a happy rhizosphere.
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:40.980]  Your plants will thrive.
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:46.760]  You may also want to add a little bit of potassium silicates at this time.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:51.140]  Potassium silicates make for robust plants, and it will also help with any stress.
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:55.460]  If you have any environmental stressors, that potassium silicate will make the plants just
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:59.580]  a little more resilient and a little tougher for the mistakes that you may make.
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:05.300]  Now, I recommend you adjust the pH of your feed solution to somewhere between 6.2 and
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:06.460]  6.4.
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:11.460]  If we were in cocoa in a commercial facility, I would tell the guys to adjust the pH to
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:12.460]  6.3.
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:18.980]  If we were in a soilless mix in a commercial facility, I would tell them to go 6.3 to 6.4.
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:20.540]  Mix up your nutrient solution.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.060]  Put your pH meter in there.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:25.580]  See what the value is, and adjust up or down as necessary.
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:26.580]  Write that down.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:29.540]  Then, water the plants with that solution.
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:33.220]  Since we're talking about watering plants, I highly recommend you go back and take a
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:38.620]  listen to episode 337, which is titled 1-5 Watering Tech.
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.940]  1-5 Watering Tech will help all growers.
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:46.260]  If you're a new grower, if you're an experienced grower, if you're a professional grower, you
[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:50.220]  will learn something from the 1-5 Water Tech episode.
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:54.860]  If you are an experienced grower and you're trying to teach a new grower how to water
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:43:00.020]  your garden, 1-5 Water Tech is a great training exercise.
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:06.780]  I recommend everybody listen to episode 337 and learn about 1-5 Watering Tech.
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:09.460]  Now, before you water your plants, we talked about the pH.
[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:13.100]  I did not talk about the temperature of the water.
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:15.940]  It's wintertime in Colorado, and it is really cold.
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:19.740]  If you're pulling water right out of the tap, it's coming out of the tap way too cold to
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:21.460]  apply to the plants.
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:26.460]  We need the water that we feed our plants to be right around 70 degrees.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:31.020]  Maybe 65 would be acceptable, but I wouldn't go much lower than 65.
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:35.420]  Imagine sticking your feet in some 65 degree water first thing in the morning.
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.060]  That's what it's like when you water the plants with 65 degree water.
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:40.620]  I wouldn't go any lower than 65.
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:45.620]  I would stay closer to 70, maybe up in the 75, not much warmer than that.
[01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:49.620]  Right around 70 degrees is just about ideal for watering the plants.
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:53.620]  In a home grow, you can always just turn the hot water on as you're filling up your container.
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:57.180]  In some environments, we don't have the option for hot water.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:01.340]  If your water is coming out too cold, you can either get a bucket heater from your local
[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:03.380]  tractor or farm supply store.
[01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:04.580]  They just sell bucket heaters.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:08.220]  They also sell them at the farm supply store for troughs so that you can warm up the pig
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:11.740]  and horse water so they don't have to drink ice water in the morning.
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:15.700]  Or if a bucket heater is not an option for you, you can always fill up containers of
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:16.700]  water.
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:20.020]  You can always just go into the flowering rooms or the bedrooms the day before and let
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:23.540]  that light and that grow room environment warm up the water for you.
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:27.580]  Of course, that's only if you remember to do that the day before.
[01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:30.620]  My point is, don't feed the plants water that is really cold.
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:34.460]  We want that water to be right around 70 degrees.
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:38.180]  Now in this first watering, make sure you really saturate the medium.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:41.420]  Make sure you have plenty of water coming out of those drainage holes.
[01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:45.260]  We want to make sure to soak every spot of the container.
[01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:49.700]  We don't want a dry spot because roots will not grow into dry areas.
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:51.820]  Nutrients aren't getting into those dry areas.
[01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:54.020]  So make sure you fully saturate the pot.
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:59.180]  I like to soak it every time I water, but it's mostly important this very first time.
[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:02.620]  Water it till you get a lot of water coming out of those holes.
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:06.540]  Also don't leave the plant ever standing in stagnant water.
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:10.540]  If that water in the bottom of your tray there doesn't evaporate or get sucked up by that
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:15.140]  plant within a few hours, get a shop vac and suck that out of there.
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:17.980]  All right, so now our plants are all successfully transplanted.
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:20.420]  They have now been fed their big kid nutrients.
[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:23.500]  Let's talk a little bit about the environment in which to keep these plants.
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:24.580]  We know where to keep the lights.
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:26.900]  We know what cycle to have the lights on.
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:29.140]  Let's talk about the temperature.
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:33.860]  During the day, I try to keep the temperature between 70 and 80 degrees.
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:37.500]  Then I try to keep the night around 65 to 75.
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:44.420]  I really try to have no more than a 10 degree swing in my temperature between day and night.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:49.460]  I'm not saying if it's 70 during the day, I want it no lower than 60 during the night.
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:52.700]  I honestly try to keep about five to seven degrees in that swing.
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.740]  I know it's difficult in a home grow.
[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:58.620]  Sometimes we don't have the appropriate equipment to monitor and or adjust things all the time,
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:03.540]  but do your best to keep it within a 10 degree differential between night and day.
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:08.300]  Now at this point in the large veg phase, I try to keep the humidity between 40 and
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:09.580]  60%.
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:11.300]  Right around 50 is ideal.
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:14.980]  If you want to understand more about why I keep the humidity and the temperature the
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:20.940]  way I do, I recommend you check out episode 314 and it's called Vapor Pressure Deficit.
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:25.620]  You can learn about VPD and why it's important to keep the temperature and humidity in the
[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:28.500]  appropriate range for our plants.
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:31.540]  Another thing I like to add to our large veg is a fan.
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:35.940]  I like to have wall fans or those fans on stands, depending on your setup.
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:39.420]  I like to have a fan just oscillating in the room, circulating the air.
[01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:40.940]  The idea is to circulate the air.
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:44.980]  I want to move the stale air around and move that fresh air around so the plants have fresh
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:46.340]  air constantly.
[01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:48.500]  You don't need to beat the shit out of the plants with the fan.
[01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:52.460]  I go in some grows and they're just terrorizing plants with fans and just beating them to
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:55.300]  death and wondering why the plants look like shit.
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:56.700]  We just want to rustle the leaves.
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:58.660]  We just want to move the air around.
[01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:03.060]  I like to put a fan, about one fan every one or two lights, depending on the size of the
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:08.220]  room and the environment, but make sure that every area is getting fresh air in that room.
[01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:13.780]  At this point, I feel like we have officially entered the large veg phase.
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:17.940]  Our main goals and focus now are to keep the plants pest and pathogen free.
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:21.220]  We need to avoid nutrient and pH mistakes.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:24.420]  Make sure not to overfeed our plants at this time.
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:29.020]  Also, pay very close attention to the pH of your feeding solutions.
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:30.980]  We need to keep these plants healthy and vigorous.
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:32.820]  We need to work on the top part of the plants now.
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:35.300]  We focused on the bottom for the first half.
[01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:37.860]  Now we're going to focus more on the top half.
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:43.020]  In the upcoming episodes, we're going to work on shaping and structuring these plants.
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:45.500]  We're also going to talk about popping and twisting.
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:50.020]  Then we'll talk about bottoming and topping and lollipopping our plants, but that is all
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:52.100]  in upcoming episodes.
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:55.340]  I've got two quick things to cover before we start wrapping up this episode and then
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:57.740]  we are out of here for this week.
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:00.820]  One thing I should talk about is pest management.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:01.980]  Now is a good time.
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:09.940]  If you are going to apply pesticide sprays, today is a good day to start that IPM program.
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:11.780]  Those plants are moving into the bedroom.
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:12.980]  They're in their big pots.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:16.540]  Let's go ahead and hit them with a light pesticide spray.
[01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:20.740]  Turn off the lights, douse the plants, give them a couple hours to dry off, turn the lights
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:24.780]  back on to the regularly scheduled program and pay attention to those plants.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:25.780]  See how they react.
[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:29.180]  Hopefully, you wrote down exactly what you sprayed on those plants.
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:32.940]  You wrote down the product and you wrote how much per gallon you applied.
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:36.480]  You wrote down what time you applied it and now you have a good frame of reference so
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.780]  you can go in and look.
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:39.580]  You can see how the plants reacted.
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:43.120]  If they look angry, you need to reduce the application next time.
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.460]  If they look happy about it, you can do the same thing or consider increasing the application
[01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:49.460]  rate if necessary.
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:53.900]  I generally start my heavy pest management application right when I move them into the
[01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:55.680]  large pots.
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:58.900]  Another thing that will be important to think about is flip time.
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:02.420]  How long are these plants going to veg in this environment?
[01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:04.500]  How much space do you have?
[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:09.060]  Depending on your genetics, depending on your lighting, depending on your overall environment,
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.880]  these plants could double in size.
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:16.780]  If you were working within a rise cross, there is a good likelihood that by the time you
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:22.660]  finish that plant, it will be twice the size it was when you started the flowering process.
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:27.540]  If that plant is 24 inches tall when you induce flowering, there's a good chance that plant
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:31.100]  will end up 48 inches tall before it is done.
[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:33.300]  So as a grower, you need to plan ahead.
[01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:37.580]  You need to make sure that plant does not grow up into your lights and burn itself.
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:40.940]  You need to save, depending on the type of light you're using, you need to save some
[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:44.080]  space between the bulb and your top cola.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:45.580]  So plan ahead.
[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:48.780]  Now is the time to start thinking about how long we're going to veg.
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:51.300]  If you veg too long, the plants will get too tall.
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.820]  You'll have problems.
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:56.660]  We're also going to do things like topping and bottoming and lollipopping and twisting
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:00.100]  and cracking and trellising and manipulating these plants.
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:03.340]  So we're going to need to give them a little bit of time to recover from some of these
[01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:06.740]  techniques before we initiate the flowering process.
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:13.500]  So if we plan ahead and know how long we anticipate to veg, we can predict when to do these steps
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:18.340]  to increase production and flower at the ideal time and fill our grow space perfectly.
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:22.420]  We can end up with our canopy right about eight inches below that light and it'll be
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:24.000]  nice and even and it'll look beautiful.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.420]  You won't have any wasted space in there.
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:30.460]  Once you're an experienced grower, your goal will be to fill your grow space.
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:35.100]  If you've got a five by five grow tent, you want a five by five canopy or at least a four
[01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:39.060]  and a half by four and a half canopy because when the air flows, it sucks in a little bit,
[01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:41.420]  but you want to fill most of that space.
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:46.060]  A very experienced grower, an older guy, he said one day, if you had a cooler and you
[01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:49.240]  could fill it with beer, would you fill it most of the way to the top with beer or would
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:51.300]  you fill that cooler all the way with beer?
[01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:53.620]  I'm not even a beer drinker and that makes sense to me.
[01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:55.700]  I want as many beers fit in that cooler.
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:56.700]  That's just the way you do it.
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:00.580]  Do you want your grow room to be halfway filled with buds or do you want to fill that fucker
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:01.660]  up with buds?
[01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:05.480]  The goal will be to maximize that canopy space.
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:08.920]  In future episodes, we will talk about trellising, lollipopping.
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:11.260]  We'll talk about sticks and cages and cracking stems.
[01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:15.820]  We will go in depth in a lot of techniques like that on ways to fill up your cooler for
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:16.820]  maximum production.
[01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:20.100]  All right, podcast world, that is a podcast for this week.

[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:53.960]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:57.680]  It's time for episode 372 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:00.600]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:05.040]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:10.680]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:14.200]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:19.480]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Banana OG Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:27.440]  On the label, it says it is 83.2% THC and a total of 97% total cannabinoids.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.040]  I really enjoyed the Banana OG.
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:32.600]  It is kind of a change from what I usually buy.
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:36.920]  I usually like a concentrate that makes my head spin, makes my eyes vibrate, makes it
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:38.200]  hard to think.
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:40.600]  The Banana OG is kind of more of a mellow thing.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:41.920]  It's got me kind of chilled out.
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:42.920]  It's kind of slow motion.
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:44.200]  It's got my eyes nice and heavy.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:48.880]  It's got my shoulders nice and chilled out, and I really dig the flavor of the Banana
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:49.880]  OG.
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.560]  So, that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:53.880]  I hope you guys are taking dabs of something delicious.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:57.120]  I'm not sure if you can tell, but I still have a little bit of that head cold hanging
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:58.120]  around.
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:53:59.120]  I'm trying to get rid of that.
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:00.360]  I'm not going to let it slow me down.
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:03.640]  I am going to deliver a quality podcast.
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:06.560]  In this episode, I plan to bring you another grow lesson.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:10.200]  Before we get to the grow lesson, I've got a couple of quick things to cover.
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:12.020]  I am working on the website.
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:14.020]  Of course, I am iRegenetics Colorado.
[01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:17.340]  My website is iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:19.380]  We are currently doing some updates.
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:23.680]  During the process of updating the website, something went completely freaking wrong,
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:27.220]  and the podcast does not work from the website anymore.
[01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:30.660]  All of the episodes that were up before the update are still accessible.
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:34.460]  None of the new things I add to the website are posting to the RSS feed.
[01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:36.300]  My web guy is working on it.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:39.820]  It is the holiday weekend, so he has taken a few days off, but I'm sure he will get back
[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:41.960]  on it as soon as the weekend is over.
[01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:46.480]  My point is, I know the website is messed up, and I apologize for not having the episodes
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:49.840]  out on iTunes and Stitcher as regularly scheduled.
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:54.640]  I was just recently bragging about not missing a Monday in five years, and now here I am.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:56.080]  I've missed at least one Monday.
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:58.960]  It looks like I may potentially miss two Mondays in a row.
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:00.280]  I do apologize.
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:04.840]  However, the episodes are recorded and the shows are posted on YouTube, so I have not
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:05.840]  stopped recording.
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:07.720]  I haven't stopped doing the shows.
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:12.960]  I'm just unable to post them to iTunes and Stitcher because of a glitch with my website.
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:15.840]  Please be patient with me, and please keep listening to the show.
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:19.440]  Please find the show on YouTube if that is your only option of listening for the next
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:20.440]  couple of weeks.
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:24.040]  Also, real quick, I want to give a shout out to the guy who works on the website for me.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:29.080]  I don't know if he listens to the show regularly or at all, but hey, if you're listening, man,
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:31.380]  big thanks for keeping the website updated.
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:35.360]  Big thanks for all the updates lately, and also big thanks for getting it fixed when
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:37.760]  you do get the RSS feed back in action.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:42.200]  All right, since I'm giving shout outs, let's give some shout outs to a few of our Patreon
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:43.200]  supporters.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.880]  I owe a big shout out to Jade.
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:49.880]  How about a big Patreon shout out to Grimble the Druid, and also a Patreon shout out to
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:54.200]  Tanner Martinowic, and of course, another shout out to my friend Mel.
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:55.880]  Thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:57.760]  I truly do appreciate it.
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:04.560]  If you want to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to www.patreon.com.
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:09.720]  That's P-A-T-R-E-O-N.com slash grow from your heart.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:12.360]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:15.080]  And again, thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:20.400]  All right, podcast world, I said earlier this was going to be another grow lesson.
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:25.960]  So far in my series of grow lessons, we should have plants that are probably 12 to 14, maybe
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:27.960]  16 or 18 inches tall.
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:31.640]  They are probably in three or five or maybe seven gallon pots.
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:33.640]  Hopefully, they are nice and healthy.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.760]  Hopefully, they've got a fat root system.
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:37.880]  Hopefully, they're pest free at this time.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:40.600]  Hopefully you haven't over or under fertilized them.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:44.620]  We've talked a lot about the proper environment and conditions and feeding for these plants.
[01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:47.160]  So I think we know how to take care of them by now.
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:52.840]  Let's talk about a few ways to improve our productivity and the vigor of our large veg
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:53.840]  plants.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:56.480]  Now, none of this stuff is required.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:58.480]  None of this stuff is mandatory.
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:03.720]  Those are the little tips and tricks and bonus things that I do to boost productivity and
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:09.040]  boost vigor to turbocharge the overall performance of my garden.
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:14.240]  One really easy thing I like to do to all of my plants to increase performance is just
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:17.160]  clean off the crap on the bottoms of the plants.
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:20.680]  You've got a stock coming out of the dirt, and then you've got a few crappy branches
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:21.680]  coming off the bottom.
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:24.720]  And then the next couple of branches will be more substantial, and then you'll have
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:26.440]  some solid branches.
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:30.840]  If those very bottom branches are crappy, don't be afraid to remove them.
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:34.960]  If you feel like they are a waste of growth on the plant, feel free to take them off.
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:38.480]  We are going to lollipop heavily once we go into flower.
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:42.120]  So don't be afraid to move some of the crappy bottom branches.
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:46.720]  If it's a long, healthy branch that has the potential to reach the canopy level, you can
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:47.720]  leave it.
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:51.520]  But if it's ugly, if it's droopy, if it's sucking up energy and not going to produce
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:54.720]  anything that would be worthwhile, feel free to take it off.
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:58.920]  Then that plant can focus its energy moving up toward the top of the plant where we want
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.660]  to build that lush canopy.
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:03.280]  So feel free to take crap off of the bottom.
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:07.360]  So now we've removed the crappy bottom branches that are kind of a waste of energy.
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:11.900]  Here is another thing we can do to the bottom section of our plant to improve the performance
[01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:14.240]  and move the energy up toward the top.
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:17.920]  We've still got bottom branches because we left some of those bottom branches on the
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:18.920]  plant.
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:22.920]  The inside bottom branching is not going to receive much light.
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:28.180]  So what I like to do is find that branch and just follow it up and remove any shoots
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:30.360]  that I feel like are a waste of space.
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:33.760]  So you'll have a thick arm coming off and then off of that, you'll have like a little
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:35.360]  tiny sub arm coming off.
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.680]  Those are the shoots.
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:38.360]  Those are on the bottom of the plant.
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:39.920]  Those are a waste of space.
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:42.860]  Those are going to turn into buds we do not want to trim.
[01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:46.360]  That is going to be fluffy, larfy, useless, little crap.
[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:47.700]  It is a trimmer's nightmare.
[01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:51.880]  By removing that crap from the bottom, we direct the energy up toward the top.
[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:54.000]  We can make bigger top chunky buds.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.320]  Those are better for trimmers.
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:56.720]  Those are better for the market.
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.240]  Those are better for the consumer.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:00.240]  Everybody wants those big fat buds.
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:02.420]  So let's clean off that crap off the bottom.
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:04.040]  So you've got the main stock coming out.
[01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:07.300]  Then you've got your bottom two, your bottom four branches.
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:11.280]  Follow those branches up and where you don't see any light touching those little shoots,
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:13.880]  feel free to just pinch them or cut them right off.
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:18.560]  While you're cutting or pinching or cleaning stuff off of plants, always keep this in mind.
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:23.920]  You can go back later and take more off, but you cannot glue the leaves and the shoots
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:25.260]  back onto the plant.
[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:27.440]  So pay attention to what you're doing.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:30.880]  But on that bottom section, just pull that crap in the inside right off of there.
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:34.200]  I go fairly hard on the bottom parts of the plants.
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:37.680]  I plan on lollipopping heavily early in flower anyway.
[01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:42.040]  So why not pull off a lot of that crap now and send the energy up toward the top of the
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:43.040]  plant?
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:46.680]  Now, while you're cleaning the bottoms of the plants, keep in mind that it may be wise
[01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:50.440]  to take some clones before we put these plants into flower.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:52.800]  What are you going to grow next?
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:55.600]  Are you growing from seed that you spent a lot of money on?
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:59.960]  If you paid a lot of money for those seeds, I definitely recommend you take a clone off
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:02.000]  of each seedling and mark it.
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.240]  We're going to talk about this in depth in a future episode.
[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:09.200]  But if you've got a plant from seed, I recommend you take a clone from it.
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:15.120]  Mark that plant, plant A. Mark your clone, clone A. Go on down the line with every seedling
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:16.680]  plant that you've got.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:17.680]  Then grow them out.
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:20.320]  Either grow out the clone or grow out the original plant.
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:24.720]  And if you've got something amazing, now you have got a keeper clone of that to keep around.
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:26.120]  We're going to talk about pheno hunting.
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:27.840]  We'll talk about mother plants.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:30.240]  We're going to talk about that sort of stuff in a future episode.
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.880]  But this is something to think about while we are cleaning the bottoms of our plants.
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:36.220]  Do you want to use those two bottom branches?
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:38.160]  May make excellent clones.
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:41.520]  Some of those shoots may have grown big enough to turn into a clone.
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:45.160]  Keep that in mind while you're cleaning up the bottoms of your plants.
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:49.680]  Now let's talk about another way to improve the productivity of our plant and also a great
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.600]  way to score a great clone from a healthy plant.
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:55.880]  And of course I'm talking about topping.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:01:00.840]  Topping our plant can greatly improve the performance of our plant if it is done at
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:05.400]  the appropriate time and at the appropriate place in the plant.
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:10.040]  Now when I say appropriate time, we can do this at just about any point in veg.
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:13.280]  Once the plant is large enough, the plants we are talking about are certainly large enough
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:16.720]  if we are in large veg, this is prime time for topping.
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:23.680]  We have to top approximately 10 to 14 days before we enter the flowering phase.
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:30.640]  When we top a cannabis plant, our mission is to remove that top node out of the plant,
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:33.980]  that giant one that's sticking out of the top, making it look like a Christmas tree.
[02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:35.680]  We want to remove that.
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:40.720]  And our goal is to make the next set of branches become two tops.
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:45.040]  And that will create competition within the branches of the plant that will make all of
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:48.920]  the branches try to reach up and become the next top.
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:54.080]  Basically, somebody killed the king and now all of those next soldiers are trying to be
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:55.480]  the next king.
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:02:00.280]  The hormones in the plant will indicate we're missing a top, somebody needs to take over.
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:04.080]  Cannabis has a trait that is called apical dominance.
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:06.880]  It really wants one dominant top.
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:11.280]  When you remove that dominant top, the rest of the tops know there's an opportunity for
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:13.120]  them to become that main top.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:18.080]  So you can top the plants at various ages and at various stages.
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:19.520]  Let's talk about the process of doing it.
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:21.520]  Let me back up and talk about doing it.
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:24.960]  Find that top branch where it's too tall, trace it down.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:28.280]  The way I like to do it, I kind of find a spot where I'm thinking about cutting it and
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:31.900]  I bend it over and I look at the plant and I say, what would the plant look like without
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:33.080]  that section?
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:34.520]  Is that too much to cut off?
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:36.460]  Is that going to be beneficial?
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:38.560]  What is my goal in topping right now?
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:43.920]  Mainly, my goal, instead of having one giant top, I want to create sort of a bush so that
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:48.080]  I can grow space and not have one giant bud hitting the light.
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:52.160]  But instead I can have a four by four section of a bunch of buds growing into the light
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:53.680]  instead of just one.
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:58.040]  By taking out that main top, you create that whole section into a bush.
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:02.820]  So see which one is going to cut out and make the others look like a nice even canopy.
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:03.820]  You will see it.
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:04.820]  You'll get good at it.
[02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:06.580]  It'll take a little bit of trial and error.
[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:08.100]  It'll take some confidence.
[02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:11.540]  It is also very strain specific.
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:14.540]  Topping an OG Kush or something like that can be a real bitch because the nodes are
[02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:18.180]  so far apart that you just make it look like a Charlie Brown Christmas tree.
[02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:21.900]  But once it grows out of that, it is going to be amazing.
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:27.320]  The more sativa dominant stuff, if you top Scarlet Begonias, if you top Storm Shadow,
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:30.260]  it makes a beautiful bush and they go crazy.
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:34.460]  So kind of grab the top and work your way down with your hand and just kind of look
[02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:36.980]  and see what it would look like if I took this off.
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:41.100]  And you'll come to a point, you'll take off one and you'll see two branches that stick
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:45.460]  up evenly toward the top and the two branches underneath that almost come right up to that
[02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:46.980]  top section as well.
[02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:50.780]  You'll have four nice new tops and you'll say, that's what Rasta Jeff is talking about.
[02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:53.240]  I want to make these four tops the tops.
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:56.700]  Then just cut that one out and you'll see exactly what I've got.
[02:03:56.700 --> 02:03:59.500]  You're probably going to screw up a couple of plants.
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:00.620]  That's how you learn stuff.
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:02.940]  Musicians have to fuck up songs to learn.
[02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:05.260]  BMX racers have to fall on their face to learn.
[02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:07.820]  Skateboarders get stitches and break bones to learn.
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:09.860]  Luckily, we mess up plants.
[02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:11.040]  We can grow more plants.
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:14.700]  It doesn't hurt us that bad when we cut up a plant the wrong way.
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:17.460]  Hopefully you've got a couple more and you're going to learn.
[02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:21.420]  The cost of cutting that one plant from what you learn from it is invaluable.
[02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:25.020]  So get in there and just play around with the scissors, top some of them, bottom some
[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:27.860]  of them up, see what they do, finish them.
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.900]  That way you have some data.
[02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:33.540]  Keep in mind that data is very strain specific.
[02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:37.100]  Like I said earlier, if you're topping an OG Kush plant, you're going to have totally
[02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:41.700]  different results than if you're topping something like a Hayes or a more sativa dominant, like
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:43.300]  a golden goat kind of a thing.
[02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:47.380]  The growth structure is just naturally different in those plants.
[02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:51.540]  Now when you're topping your plant, do it at the intersection where it's going to encourage
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:54.800]  that plant the most expansive growth.
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:58.280]  So if you've got two branches, you've got the main stock coming up, you've got a branch
[02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:02.760]  coming out and then maybe an inch up, you've got a branch coming out, cut right above that
[02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:03.760]  top branch.
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:06.880]  You don't need to leave anything hanging off or anything extra.
[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:10.920]  Cut it right at the intersection where you want to encourage the spread.
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:14.920]  You basically want to take an upside down peace sign and you want to turn it into a
[02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:20.000]  Y and those new tops of the Y are going to be the new two tops of the plant.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.080]  And then the next two branches, hopefully they'll catch up.
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:24.640]  Now that puts me back to why I said,
[02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:29.920]  we want to do this at least 10 to 14 days before we go into flower or much sooner than
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:32.280]  that if it's an opportunity.
[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:34.600]  When we make that cut, we've just cut out the king.
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:39.280]  Like I said earlier, we need time for those hormones to move around into the plant and
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:43.480]  that helps us when we go into flower, we get much larger bud sets.
[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:47.900]  If you flower too soon after topping, your plants just create little popcorn buds.
[02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:49.680]  The hormones haven't moved around.
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:51.520]  They're not exactly sure what to do.
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:53.320]  They're not sure where the top should go.
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:55.640]  You just get a bunch of little popcorns.
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:59.800]  Give the plant plenty of time to recover, plenty of time to move the hormones and plenty
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:04.760]  of time for it to decide where the tops are going to be after topping and before moving
[02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:07.120]  your plants into flower.
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:10.840]  Earlier I mentioned that this would be a good opportunity for a clone.
[02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:15.840]  That top you just cut off should be the most robust, hardiest part of your plant.
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:19.080]  That will make a great candidate for a clone.
[02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:21.080]  So why not snag that up?
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:25.040]  Now you've got a big, fat, healthy clone for the next crop while you're increasing the
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:27.400]  productivity of the current crop.
[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:32.280]  All right, so we've covered two great ways to increase the vigor and productivity of
[02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:33.280]  our plants.
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:37.780]  We figured out how to properly move the energy to the part of the plant we want to grow.
[02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:40.480]  You can move it up to the top by taking stuff off the bottom.
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:43.440]  You can spread it out by completely eliminating the top.
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:48.440]  In that process, we've also created the opportunity to create clones.
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:52.000]  Now let's talk about another great technique that I use in a personal garden.
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.600]  I use this in a breeding program.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:55.680]  I use this in a large commercial grow.
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:59.360]  This is something I implement in almost any grow I get to play in.
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:01.920]  I call it the pop and twist technique.
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.880]  You may also know it as super cropping.
[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:05.800]  It has got a lot of names.
[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:08.280]  It is the same thing no matter what we call it.
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:10.560]  I like to pop the stems of the plant.
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:12.880]  I like to kind of pop their knuckles.
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:14.320]  I don't know if you can hear that on the microphone.
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:15.720]  I tried to get it in there.
[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:18.400]  That's basically the sound I'm looking for.
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:23.000]  Once the plants are a little bit thicker than a pen or a pencil, maybe a Sharpie, I like
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.480]  to grab them right where they come out of the dirt.
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:28.320]  I grab the stalk kind of firmly with one hand.
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:32.000]  Then I grab it with another hand right above it and I twist my top hand.
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.040]  I don't twist that hand that's coming out of the dirt.
[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:35.160]  I don't want to twist that dirt.
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:41.280]  I twist the top hand to where I break the cellulose of the plant, break that outer structure
[02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:42.640]  to where you hear it pop a little bit.
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:45.400]  It'll go crunch just like my knuckle did.
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:47.800]  It'll make a little pop sound and you'll feel it.
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:49.800]  You'll be freaked out the first time.
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:50.800]  It's okay.
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:51.800]  Don't freak out.
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:54.080]  You're doing exactly what I recommend.
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:57.840]  This will increase vigor and productivity in a couple of ways.
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:00.160]  This will be beneficial in a couple of ways.
[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:03.160]  Let's talk about that real quick and we'll talk more about how to do this throughout
[02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:04.800]  the entire plant.
[02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:07.920]  The first thing you'll notice when you're popping the knuckles on these plants is they
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:10.960]  will start to make little knuckles on the branches.
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:16.440]  I feel like these make the plants more stout, more robust so that when they start to grow
[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:20.320]  buds, those branches can hold up bigger buds.
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:21.840]  Bigger branches, bigger buds.
[02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:22.840]  That makes sense.
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:24.080]  You want more support.
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:26.200]  Bigger legs, you can lift more.
[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:27.200]  You're stronger.
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:28.200]  I don't know if that matts out.
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:31.440]  I'm not a weightlifter guy, but if you've got more, you can lift more.
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:33.840]  You want something able to support bigger buds.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:38.560]  Also, those bigger stems can probably feed those bigger flowers better.
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:40.200]  You've got more movement.
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:45.000]  Another way this is beneficial is it will slow down the vertical growth of the plants.
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.240]  They won't get so tall so quickly because they will be spending a little bit of their
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:52.280]  energy on getting fatter and more robust.
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:57.600]  They'll be short and stocky, which is way beneficial to almost any grower.
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:08:59.160]  Most of us are limited by height.
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:03.680]  In a home grow, in a commercial grow, in a giant warehouse grow, most of us are still
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:05.360]  limited by height.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:09.840]  Having this one tip to control the height of our plants just a little bit can be very
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:11.400]  advantageous.
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:13.080]  Later on, we're going to talk about trellising.
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:16.920]  If you can use cracking and trellising together, you can really control the height of your
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:20.080]  plants and you can really maximize productivity.
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:22.520]  Those are a few reasons why I like to crack the stems.
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:26.320]  Now, let's talk a little bit more about actually doing it now that I've given you a good reason
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:28.000]  why to do this.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:32.600]  Like I said, I grab the stick with one hand, I grab the stick with another, and I just
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:34.800]  twist opposite directions.
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:35.800]  You'll hear it.
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:38.360]  It will go pop and crunch, then just move up.
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:44.840]  I start with the main stock of the plant and I work my way almost 90% up the way of
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:45.840]  the plant.
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:49.080]  As long as I can feel it still crunching, as long as I'm not feeling like I'm about
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:53.400]  to rip the top off the plant when I give it a twist, I'll work my way right up.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:57.180]  Then I go to the bottom branch and work my way right up the bottom branch.
[02:09:57.180 --> 02:09:59.440]  Then the next branch and give it a crack.
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:00.620]  I'll give it a crack.
[02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:03.560]  I'm looking at the microphone stand here trying to think about the distance of cracks.
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:09.440]  I go one and then it's only four to six inches apart depending on the size of the plant.
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:12.920]  I will crack it maybe if it's a tiny plant, if they're short and squat, I would go every
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:15.720]  three inches if I feel like that plant could take it.
[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:19.680]  Most of them will take it about every four to six inches without any problems.
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:24.000]  Give it a little crack, move up, give it a little crack, move up, give it a little crack.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.200]  Just do that to every plant in the garden.
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:27.520]  It will slow down their growth.
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:29.160]  It'll make them more robust.
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:30.900]  They'll be more vigorous.
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:35.340]  You can continue to do this all the way into about week three of flower.
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:39.300]  If you start it early in veg, you can get a good cracking in there.
[02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:43.540]  Give them about seven, maybe 10 days to heal up, go back, give them another good crack,
[02:10:43.540 --> 02:10:44.820]  throw them into flower.
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:48.540]  As they get bigger, they will recover more quickly from being busted on.
[02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:51.100]  Go in there and give them a good crack on day one of flower.
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:54.980]  At the start of the flowering cycle, slow down that stretch a little bit.
[02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:56.260]  Think about it this way.
[02:10:56.260 --> 02:11:01.200]  If you crack spot one and then spot two, there's a spot in the middle of that that
[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:02.620]  you can crack next time.
[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:04.380]  You can go back in a week.
[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:07.540]  Even if they haven't healed up from all of their cracking, you can crack those middle
[02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:13.120]  spots and make even another little knurled spot on your plants.
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:16.700]  Don't be afraid to get in there and do some work on them and bust them up a little bit.
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:21.220]  They will recover and they will really show progress from this.
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:24.380]  I know I probably sound like I'm crazy because for the past 10 minutes, I've been telling
[02:11:24.380 --> 02:11:28.540]  you to cut stuff off of your plants and break them and bend them, and that's going to increase
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:29.540]  productivity.
[02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:31.820]  But how do you get stronger?
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:34.260]  Through stress, through proper training.
[02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:35.660]  And that's what we're going to do to these plants.
[02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:38.340]  We're going to tell them what we want from them and we're going to show them what we
[02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:42.260]  expect and they're going to give it to us with the proper guidance.
[02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:46.580]  Speaking of guidance, let's work our way into talking about canopy control.
[02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:51.820]  Earlier, I mentioned that our plants are apical dominant, meaning they want to grow straight
[02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:52.820]  up.
[02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:56.940]  Unfortunately for us as growers, it does not benefit us for the plants to grow straight
[02:11:56.940 --> 02:11:57.940]  up.
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:11:59.700]  We need to fill horizontal space.
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:01.700]  We need to spread them out a little bit.
[02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:05.500]  We have several options for encouraging our plants to spread out.
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:10.420]  Our earlier work of topping them was a great start, but we can go much further than that.
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:15.840]  A very easy, affordable, and effective way to spread out our plants a little bit is by
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:17.060]  using sticks.
[02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:20.820]  You can get bamboo sticks at the local growth store for very cheap.
[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:25.980]  I like to put about four sticks per pot and I like to put them toward the outer edge of
[02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:26.980]  the pot.
[02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:29.580]  Don't go too far in because you've got a lot of root development there.
[02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:32.740]  You don't want to go shoving a bamboo stick right through a bunch of roots.
[02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:35.940]  So go out toward the edge of the pot, put the stick in there.
[02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:39.580]  If your plants are going to grow six feet tall, get a six foot stick.
[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:43.200]  If your plants are only going to grow three feet tall, get a three foot stick.
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:46.660]  You don't want a stick too big to where you can't lower the light close enough to the
[02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:47.660]  canopy.
[02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:49.540]  So get the appropriate size stick.
[02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:53.020]  Get three or four, five or six of them in the pot, depending on how many giant floppy
[02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:55.060]  branches you've got.
[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:58.980]  Then you can just pull those big branches down just a little bit and attach them to
[02:12:58.980 --> 02:12:59.980]  the sticks.
[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:03.300]  Now, instead of just having them going straight up, you've kind of pulled them down a little
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:04.300]  bit.
[02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:07.780]  Now, they're probably one or two, maybe three inches shorter, depending on how far you pull
[02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:08.780]  them down.
[02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:10.580]  Pull them down and affix them to those sticks.
[02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:12.220]  Now, you're doing a couple of things.
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:16.700]  You're making the plant overall shorter and you're also widening the plant up to let some
[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:19.980]  light get into that inner part of the plant, so where you don't have to clean off as much
[02:13:19.980 --> 02:13:23.500]  of that crap in the inside, more of the light can penetrate in there and you will get more
[02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:26.420]  production from the inside part of the plant.
[02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:29.020]  Now, these sticks will also work for another purpose.
[02:13:29.020 --> 02:13:33.660]  When those buds start to develop and get fat and big, those sticks will support your buds.
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:37.200]  You're going to need something to hold up the big buds, so now is the time to think
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:38.200]  about it.
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:42.460]  Let's work that into our canopy control and also our plan for supporting our buds.
[02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:45.340]  So sticks is the easiest, most affordable option.
[02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:49.180]  If you've got a small grow, if you've got a home grow, sticks are probably the most
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:50.340]  economical.
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:55.020]  If you've got several plants, a bunch of sticks can become a pain in the ass.
[02:13:55.020 --> 02:13:58.180]  In a commercial environment, I wouldn't even mess with sticks.
[02:13:58.180 --> 02:14:02.060]  In a commercial environment, you may want to start working with tomato cages.
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:06.180]  You need to get the tomato cages on the plants before they get too big.
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:10.020]  I usually like a tomato cage with about a 16-inch top.
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:14.420]  Sometimes I will cut the very bottom ring off of the tomato cage, flip it upside down,
[02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:16.380]  whatever that bottom ring is, cut it off.
[02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:19.480]  You've just made it a little bit shorter, but it's also a little bit wider.
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:22.860]  You can customize them for your situation.
[02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:25.220]  So slide the tomato cage over the plant.
[02:14:25.220 --> 02:14:26.900]  Spread the plant out nice and wide.
[02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:29.100]  Let it spread as wide as it will go.
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:30.460]  Encourage it to spread out.
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:34.660]  If you need to pull some of the branches out of the cage, pull it out of the cage, and
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:38.900]  as it grows, it'll work itself up, and when it gets real tall, put the branch back into
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:39.900]  the cage.
[02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:44.980]  Or use those runners up the side, the side supports, and you can always affix the branches
[02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:50.900]  to those side supports by using a bread tie or a twisty tie or some sort of garden supply
[02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:51.900]  twist tie.
[02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:53.140]  There are thousands of options for that.
[02:14:53.140 --> 02:14:54.140]  Get creative.
[02:14:54.140 --> 02:14:55.460]  I've used a bunch of different things.
[02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:56.500]  We don't need to be too specific.
[02:14:56.500 --> 02:14:59.260]  I use zip ties in most cases, but don't go too tight.
[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:03.340]  So if you've got your tomato cage on your plant, the branches are falling out and gaining
[02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:06.580]  support from the outer perimeter of the tomato cage.
[02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:09.740]  Maybe you've worked some of the branches up the side of that tomato cage.
[02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:14.220]  Maybe you've pulled some of the branches down and spread them out by using those outer rings
[02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:15.540]  of the tomato cage.
[02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:20.020]  The tomato cage gives us a lot of creative options for controlling the canopy of our
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:26.460]  plant while at the same time providing support for our tall, heavy buds.
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:30.480]  Now if you're using a tomato cage and you did not top your plant, which is just fine.
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:31.480]  That is always an option.
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:32.940]  You do not have to top the plant.
[02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:36.020]  A lot of people like that one big glory bud at the top.
[02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:40.740]  If you're going for that glory bud and you were using a tomato cage, you still may need
[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:45.420]  a stick to support that giant bud if you grow a big fat top.
[02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:47.780]  So don't be afraid to make them work together.
[02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:51.740]  You can have a tomato cage with a stick holding up that giant bud in the middle.
[02:15:51.740 --> 02:15:55.800]  Again, if you're going to put a stick in a giant pot, I would kind of recommend putting
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:59.220]  it toward the outer edge and then angling it toward the center if you need support in
[02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:00.220]  the center.
[02:16:00.220 --> 02:16:03.540]  I don't like to ram a bamboo stake right into the root zone.
[02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:04.900]  That just feels rude to me.
[02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:07.960]  If you want it to be right in the middle because you've got some kind of OCD or that's
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:11.900]  where you need to do it, you can do it, but just you'll feel it when you go through those
[02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:14.060]  roots and it won't feel right.
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:19.000]  So those are two very effective methods of controlling your canopy and also supporting
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.500]  the large branches and being prepared for having large buds.
[02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:25.020]  I know I kind of glazed over those two methods.
[02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:27.940]  Those are things you're going to have to perfect and work on.
[02:16:27.940 --> 02:16:31.020]  It's going to be things you have to put your hands on to learn how to do it.
[02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:32.020]  It's kind of an art.
[02:16:32.020 --> 02:16:35.180]  There'll be things that you learn when you're doing it that will work perfectly for your
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:38.100]  situation that would not work for the next guy.
[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:41.620]  The sticks are really easy because you can just stick as many sticks into a pot as you
[02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:42.620]  need.
[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:44.540]  I mean, I've seen people go completely excessive.
[02:16:44.540 --> 02:16:48.300]  Try not to be too crazy, but you can stick as many sticks into a pot of soil as you need
[02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:51.380]  to support as many branches as you need.
[02:16:51.380 --> 02:16:55.980]  And you can use fuzzy sticks or bread ties or zip ties, whatever you need to affix those
[02:16:55.980 --> 02:16:59.220]  branches to those sticks however you need.
[02:16:59.220 --> 02:17:02.900]  It's a little harder to lower the canopy that way, but you can get big branch support
[02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:04.340]  that way really easily.
[02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:09.380]  The tomato cages, you can use the zip ties or the twisty ties and you have got round
[02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:10.540]  circles to work with.
[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:12.640]  You can use those to keep the plants down.
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:17.980]  You can bend the branches underneath the rings of the tomato cage, or you can use those to
[02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:19.300]  support the big buds.
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:22.220]  You've got a lot of options there to work with, but you're going to have to play with
[02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:23.220]  it to figure it out.
[02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:27.620]  I can walk you so far through it, but it's going to be strain dependent, situational
[02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:31.500]  dependent, but those are very versatile tools to work with and I'm sure you'll find some
[02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.500]  use.
[02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:36.980]  Now, let me quit rambling and talk about one of my favorite methods of canopy control,
[02:17:36.980 --> 02:17:42.060]  which is using trellis netting, also known as scrog netting.
[02:17:42.060 --> 02:17:45.540]  And of course, scrog, S-C-R-O-G, just means screen of green.
[02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:49.500]  We're using a screen to create a nice green canopy.
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:52.860]  Let's talk about creating a screen of green.
[02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:57.620]  The number one most common mistake I see people make when they are setting up their
[02:17:57.620 --> 02:18:02.940]  screen or their trellis netting for their screen of green or for their canopy control
[02:18:02.940 --> 02:18:06.540]  is they put the netting way too loose.
[02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:08.020]  It needs to be tighter.
[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:09.800]  You want that stuff really tight.
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:11.180]  You want it almost scary tight.
[02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:12.420]  You want a lot of tension on there.
[02:18:12.420 --> 02:18:16.060]  You don't want those squares, you don't want the net to move at all.
[02:18:16.060 --> 02:18:20.440]  You want those squares to stay right in place because that is what is going to control the
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:21.700]  shape of your plant.
[02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:23.740]  If those things move, the plant moves.
[02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:27.700]  I like them tight, nice and firm like a guitar string.
[02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:31.660]  So let's talk more about the netting now that I've already pointed out the number one mistake.
[02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:34.620]  Let's say we're setting up a net in a five by five tent.
[02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:36.140]  It's really easy to set them up in a tent.
[02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:37.500]  They've already got the poles.
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:41.340]  If you don't have poles or something to affix it to, you're going to need to design some
[02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:42.340]  sort of system.
[02:18:42.340 --> 02:18:43.780]  You can attach it to the wall.
[02:18:43.780 --> 02:18:48.060]  A lot of people will get a five gallon bucket from Lowe's or Home Depot.
[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:52.700]  They will fill it up with quickrete and then they will stick a six foot tall PVC pole into
[02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:54.360]  there sticking straight up.
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:58.660]  Now you've got a nice vertical pole that you can work with to attach your net to and that
[02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:00.020]  will hold a lot of weight.
[02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:03.500]  You can probably get it tight enough with that five gallon bucket filled with cement.
[02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:07.100]  That'll be enough weight to be able to pull those screens super tight.
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:11.000]  So get yourself four buckets, fill them up with the quickrete, put a six foot pole in
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  each one.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:13.240]  Now you make a little square.
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:17.740]  Now you can make just about any type of length or width of shape you need to put your trellis
[02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:18.740]  netting.
[02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:22.420]  I think they sell it in five by five squares, five by 10 squares.
[02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:27.580]  If you want to go commercial grade, you can get it in much larger segments, sections,
[02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:30.460]  whatever the word you want to use right there, you can get it.
[02:19:30.460 --> 02:19:36.100]  In a commercial environment, I recommend the six foot wide commercial greenhouse tables.
[02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:42.460]  I have found a six foot wide roll of plastic trellis netting that works beautifully for
[02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:43.460]  that application.
[02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:49.700]  It is six feet wide and it is I think 75 or 120 feet long and it is one roll.
[02:19:49.700 --> 02:19:52.100]  So you just put it up on top of the trellis.
[02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:55.140]  You got one guy on one side, one guy on the other, and it's on a roll.
[02:19:55.140 --> 02:19:59.500]  So you just walk and you zip tie one end of it down, one end of it down and you walk the
[02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:02.780]  length you need to be and you zip tie the other end, zip tie the other end and you cut
[02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:04.820]  it off and now the trellis net is up.
[02:20:04.820 --> 02:20:08.620]  Of course you got to go back through and tighten it by using more zip ties, but that's almost
[02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:11.120]  kind of fun once you've got it put up that easily.
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:13.560]  So the long rolls are amazing.
[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:17.600]  They get a little bit heavy, but if you've got two big dudes, I'm six five, my buddy
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:19.400]  Brian, he was six foot something.
[02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:23.960]  We just grab it, lift it just above plant height, walk right down the rows, stretch
[02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:28.120]  out a long enough piece to cover that whole row, zip tie it at the end and cut our section
[02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:29.120]  off.
[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:31.400]  We'd have another guy following behind us and he would put zip ties in place to keep
[02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:34.840]  it real tight and it would take us just a few minutes to get each row done.
[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:37.800]  So you've got to start by spreading out your trellis netting.
[02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:38.800]  That's always fun.
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:42.960]  Once it's folded up in that little baggie, it is such a bitch to get that undone.
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:43.960]  Good luck.
[02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:45.480]  You look like Spider-Man attacked you and fucking won.
[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:48.080]  You're going to be there for a few minutes getting that unfolded.
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:50.200]  The bigger the net, the longer it takes.
[02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:51.200]  Don't get frustrated.
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:52.760]  Go smoke a dab and then you know what?
[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:56.600]  Don't smoke a dab because when you get all stoned and you're trying to look at that netting,
[02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:58.160]  that shit doesn't work for your face.
[02:20:58.160 --> 02:20:59.720]  So just unfold that.
[02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:01.560]  Then once we get it put up, we'll go take some dabs.
[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:03.420]  So unfold the trellis netting the best you can.
[02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:04.860]  It's going to take you a few minutes.
[02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:06.880]  Get it put up on whatever poles you've got available.
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:09.200]  I said we're going to work in a five by five tent.
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:12.400]  Hopefully you bought a five by five section of netting.
[02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:13.580]  It may be too big.
[02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:15.460]  You may need to go in a square.
[02:21:15.460 --> 02:21:17.360]  You may not need to use that outer square.
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:22.240]  You may need to go one or two squares into that grid to make it fit tight enough.
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:25.360]  You don't have to necessarily use every square of that netting.
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:28.720]  We want it tight more than we want the amount of squares.
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:30.060]  So get that net up there tight.
[02:21:30.060 --> 02:21:31.200]  Use a bunch of zip ties.
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:32.600]  Go excessive if you need it to.
[02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:34.680]  We want that thing fairly tight.
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:37.480]  Then lower it down onto the plant canopy.
[02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:39.420]  You'll watch the plants kind of bend.
[02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:40.420]  You want to just keep going.
[02:21:40.420 --> 02:21:42.400]  Just kind of bend them down just a little bit.
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:43.400]  Not too far.
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:44.400]  Maybe like three or four inches.
[02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:45.400]  They'll bend.
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:46.400]  They'll be okay.
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:48.680]  If you see something that's about to crack, of course, grab it and give it a hand.
[02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:51.640]  The idea here is to actually lower the height of all of the plants.
[02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:55.400]  And we're going to use that net to control the height of the plants.
[02:21:55.400 --> 02:21:59.200]  Don't worry because we're going to go back and manually adjust each branch by hand and
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:01.300]  work it into this net correctly.
[02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:05.740]  Right now we just kind of want to lower it down and watch that canopy just become even.
[02:22:05.740 --> 02:22:08.180]  Now you can see how this works.
[02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:12.980]  We have instead of one giant bud here, one long branch here, one giant bud on a long
[02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:13.980]  branch over here.
[02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:16.180]  Now we've got a nice even space to work with.
[02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:21.900]  We want to fill all that five by five net with a bunch of small bud sites that will
[02:22:21.900 --> 02:22:27.540]  actually turn into more productivity than one giant bud here, one giant bud here that
[02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:28.740]  are trying to touch the light.
[02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:31.860]  We're fighting those from getting too hot, getting burnt, getting crispy.
[02:22:31.860 --> 02:22:34.780]  And then we've got a bunch of buds down here that aren't getting enough light.
[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:40.000]  Instead we've got a nice five by five screen of green of just beautiful even buds.
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:45.460]  So let's talk about how to work these branches into this net to create this desired canopy.
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:50.860]  Working a section of plants into a trellis net is a bit of an art and it will take some
[02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:53.140]  experience to perfect it.
[02:22:53.140 --> 02:22:54.640]  Think of it sort of like weaving.
[02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:57.860]  We want to weave these plants that want to go vertical.
[02:22:57.980 --> 02:23:03.060]  We want to weave them into the net to encourage them to go horizontally.
[02:23:03.060 --> 02:23:06.860]  Now almost no matter what we do to these plants other than kill them, they're going to try
[02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:12.380]  to grow up because earlier we spoke of that hormone that gives them apical dominance.
[02:23:12.380 --> 02:23:17.560]  So we are going to need to stay on top of canopy control in this trellis system.
[02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:23.100]  The idea is to fill each square of that trellis net with a branch that will develop into a
[02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:24.900]  substantial bud site.
[02:23:24.900 --> 02:23:30.080]  The way to start that process is to train these plants to spread wide instead of tall.
[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:34.980]  So we use this first layer of netting to actually spread the plants out.
[02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:39.140]  Now what we have to do as the plants grow is they will try to pop up out of the net.
[02:23:39.140 --> 02:23:43.020]  We need to go in there every day and grab those branches that tried to get away and
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:45.900]  just push them back under that next piece of net.
[02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:50.180]  So as soon as they're long enough to go underneath the next section, just weave them right underneath
[02:23:50.180 --> 02:23:51.180]  there.
[02:23:51.180 --> 02:23:55.500]  What will happen is you will develop long arms that fill up the entire space and when
[02:23:55.500 --> 02:24:00.220]  we flip it to flower, all of those branches will develop bud sites that will fill up each
[02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:02.780]  square of that trellis netting.
[02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:06.580]  Now instead of having plants that just grow big giant buds and grow up into the light
[02:24:06.580 --> 02:24:11.420]  and are really good for pictures, we are actually producing a large crop by utilizing the entire
[02:24:11.420 --> 02:24:14.340]  five by five canopy space.
[02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:17.900]  Now this will take some practice to figure out exactly what I'm saying.
[02:24:17.900 --> 02:24:21.580]  Some of you are going to try to force those plants down too much.
[02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:26.820]  Somebody that taught me a lot of tips on trellis work will tell you, give it a fucking chance.
[02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:29.260]  You've got to give it some more to grow up and win.
[02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:33.980]  The tips of the branches like to go up, give them a chance to win, but don't be scared
[02:24:33.980 --> 02:24:35.780]  to get in there and bend them down.
[02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:41.260]  Now something that is hard to convey through just audio without any sort of visual is you
[02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:46.020]  may think that to get this branch, the tip of this branch under this net, that you may
[02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:47.900]  need to bend it at wrist height.
[02:24:47.900 --> 02:24:51.500]  I'm showing myself, I'm comparing the microphone stand to my wrist.
[02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:52.860]  The microphone stand is horizontal.
[02:24:52.860 --> 02:24:54.820]  My wrist is growing up like a plant.
[02:24:54.820 --> 02:24:59.500]  I want to tuck this, my wrist underneath this piece of trellising.
[02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:03.100]  Instead of grabbing at my wrist and bending there and tucking that part under, I would
[02:25:03.100 --> 02:25:08.540]  actually go down to elbow height to my elbow joint and pop it down there and bend it underneath
[02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:10.100]  the trellis at that height.
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:13.920]  That gives me a lot more room for when that plant starts growing vertically, it's going
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:17.600]  to grow out horizontally because of gravity for a little while, the tip will start growing
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:21.960]  up and it's going to take it a little bit longer to grow up out of that net again.
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:26.800]  Don't be afraid to crack it lower than you think you need to is what I'm trying to say.
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:31.040]  Hopefully that gave you enough different explanations to try to catch on to what I'm saying, but
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:35.080]  if you think you need to crack it here to get it underneath the net that's right here,
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:39.640]  go a little lower so you've got more bending room to work with and you've also got more
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:41.800]  room for future growth.
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:47.480]  Trellising and canopy work is an art, but when you get good at it, it will drastically
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:51.800]  improve productivity and will also make the garden much easier to work in because it's
[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:56.280]  much more organized and you don't have that one giant bud that's trying to grow into the
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:26:00.560]  light, which is so photogenic and it's so beautiful to have, but it's also such a pain
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:06.040]  in the ass because that's the one bud you are working your whole garden setup around.
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:08.620]  You will learn how to weave your plants into this net perfectly.
[02:26:08.620 --> 02:26:10.520]  You will adapt your own style.
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:13.920]  I'm sure you're going to the internet to look at pictures of how to do it already.
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:15.800]  You'll see a lot of great stuff on there.
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:20.660]  You will also see a lot of trellis nets that were not filled sufficiently before the plants
[02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:22.180]  were flipped into flower.
[02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:23.240]  Fill that shit out.
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:24.400]  It takes a little bit of time.
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:30.760]  It takes more work, but it is much more rewarding than just growing that one glory bud.
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:34.800]  So if you're going to use the screen to spread them out, make sure you fill up that canopy
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:36.160]  before you flip.
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:40.160]  Now, I also recommend a second layer of trellis netting.
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:43.920]  I probably would put that one, depending on the power of your light, depending on your
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:49.400]  genetics, I would probably put my second net somewhere between six and 12 inches above
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:50.840]  that first net.
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:53.120]  Now the bottom net will fill up.
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:55.080]  You'll weave it all in and it will get full.
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:59.380]  Now you want to let those branches start growing up into that second net.
[02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:03.720]  You want to fill it up to where you've got one branch coming out of each of those bottom
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:06.840]  squares, and those will grow up into the top squares.
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:09.600]  As soon as they hit the top squares, you want to flower.
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:15.920]  Now you've got a nice six to 12 inch section of just rows of buds, just rows of branches
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:17.480]  sticking straight up.
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:24.400]  I would almost lollipop and bottom and defoliate almost everything underneath that first net.
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:25.560]  That all gets cleaned off.
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:29.400]  All that larvae stuff, the canopy is, the light's not going to penetrate the canopy
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:31.160]  far enough to make that worth anything.
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:33.320]  I generally clean all that off.
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:36.600]  So that bottom net is there to spread them out and give them control.
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:40.640]  You want to spread the plant that would be growing five feet tall straight up.
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:44.800]  We've got it three feet tall, but it's also spread five by five feet wide.
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:46.960]  So we're trying to fill in all that net space.
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:50.700]  Then we're going to let it grow a little bit vertically out of that until it kind of gets
[02:27:50.700 --> 02:27:52.360]  close to that next net.
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:53.680]  Then we're going to flower.
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:57.720]  All those branches that are sticking straight up are going to turn into big fat buds that
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:27:59.720]  will grow into that second net.
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:03.120]  That second net at that point is going to work as a support.
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:07.920]  It's only going to be there to hold up all of your giant buds.
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:12.200]  Quite often in a commercial environment, I've had to use a triple trellis and sometimes
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:14.600]  we have considered a fourth.
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:17.800]  That's all going to depend on your genetics and what kind of lights you're using.
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:21.960]  Of course, we're using things like a rise underneath Gavita lighting in a commercial
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:22.960]  environment.
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:24.720]  We were getting serious growth.
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:28.520]  If you're in a tent, you're only going to need the spread net and then the one net up
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:30.200]  top for support.
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:33.480]  If you want to use the trellis netting and you don't want to work it into the net as
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:38.400]  far, if you just want to use it more for a spread and not create the scrog, you can do
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:39.400]  that.
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:41.000]  You don't have to work them as far.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.480]  You can just put the net on and spread them out.
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:45.840]  Try to get one stick per branch if you can.
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:47.680]  Try not to overcrowd anything.
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:49.500]  The idea is just to spread it out.
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:52.300]  You want to spread them, make them shorter than they were tall.
[02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:55.720]  You want to use more of that vertical space.
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:59.440]  Somebody taught us a long time ago, if you've got a cooler, do you just want to put one
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:03.960]  layer of beer in that cooler or do you want to fill that whole cooler up with beer?
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:05.760]  That's kind of what we're trying to do with our canopy.
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:07.840]  We don't just want a couple of beers touching the light.
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:09.540]  We don't want to make a beer tower.
[02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:13.140]  We want to knock all those beers down and put them in one nice case just like they were
[02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:15.400]  sold in because that's how they stack the best.
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:16.400]  That's how you can fill it the best.
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:20.360]  I'm not even a beer drinker and I still want to fit as many beers as we can in a cooler.
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:25.400]  Also, I should recommend an article I read a long time ago by an author named Eric Bixa.
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:29.920]  The article was called Growing on the Grid and it was exactly on this subject.
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:35.480]  It talked about maximizing your growth potential by utilizing the horizontal space, not just
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:38.640]  the vertical space that our plants try to create.
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:41.800]  One thing I should mention is that you will not be able to move these plants once you
[02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:43.880]  put the trellis net on.
[02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:47.680]  You've got to do this in whatever room these plants will be flowering in.
[02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:51.120]  I started the example by using a five by five grow tent.
[02:29:51.120 --> 02:29:55.440]  In most cases, we would veg in that five by five, put up the scrog, and then flower
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:56.560]  it in that five by five.
[02:29:56.560 --> 02:29:57.600]  Not a big deal.
[02:29:57.600 --> 02:30:02.460]  If you are vegging and flowering in a different environment, you will have to veg them, drag
[02:30:02.460 --> 02:30:07.120]  them to the flowering room, try to put that trellis up on day one, spread them out nice
[02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:08.120]  and wide.
[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:11.360]  You're not going to be able to work them in too much, but you can bend and manipulate
[02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:14.880]  the plants a little bit without causing any problems.
[02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:17.760]  Use the cracking technique I talked about earlier.
[02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:21.360]  Grab the branch, give it a little bit of a twist, and bend it over just a little bit.
[02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:23.520]  You'll be able to create a little knuckle there.
[02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:24.880]  Also create a nice smooth bend.
[02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:25.880]  You can control the plant.
[02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:28.000]  Aim it any direction you want.
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.240]  Move it over to the section of the trellis you need it.
[02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:32.120]  Just be very gentle with them.
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:36.000]  Give them several days to recover before you go back in and crack them again.
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:39.080]  This is pretty much how we're forced to do it in a commercial environment because we
[02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:41.380]  don't veg and flower in the same room.
[02:30:41.380 --> 02:30:45.880]  We usually have one large veg area and multiple flowering rooms so that we can keep perpetual
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:47.200]  cycles going.
[02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:51.880]  In a commercial environment, one of my major goals is to harvest and refill a room in the
[02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:52.880]  same day.
[02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:58.400]  I know that doesn't sound like a big challenge, but imagine if you've got 300 plants in one
[02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:00.480]  room, you've got a bunch of trellis netting.
[02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:02.840]  It takes half of the day to get it cut down.
[02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:06.320]  Then you got to clean the room spotless, then try to refill it.
[02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:07.320]  That's always fun.
[02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:08.880]  Then we throw the net on.
[02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:12.880]  Then we spend the rest of the day just spreading those plants out and adjusting that net to
[02:31:12.880 --> 02:31:15.800]  where those plants aren't too angry with us.
[02:31:15.800 --> 02:31:21.480]  That is my long sidetrack rambly talk on sticks, cages, and trellis netting and canopy
[02:31:21.480 --> 02:31:22.480]  control.
[02:31:22.480 --> 02:31:27.040]  I've got a couple more quick things to cover on this list of ways to improve our productivity
[02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:28.680]  while in veg.
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:33.480]  The next thing on my list is integrated pest management and scouting.
[02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:39.280]  We should probably be applying a preventative pesticide regimen to our plants at this time.
[02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:43.180]  If you're going to use a spray application, now is the time to get started.
[02:31:43.180 --> 02:31:47.300]  If you're going to use predator bugs, now is the time to order them and get them prepared
[02:31:47.300 --> 02:31:51.840]  so that we have a nice colony before we go into flower.
[02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:57.380]  One thing a lot of growers overlook at this stage of the game is manually scouting for
[02:31:57.380 --> 02:31:58.380]  pests.
[02:31:58.380 --> 02:32:02.540]  One of your best tools in finding bugs in your grow is your own eyes.
[02:32:02.540 --> 02:32:08.540]  Spend a little time walking through the garden and just looking for pests or signs of pests.
[02:32:08.540 --> 02:32:12.740]  Nature really likes to give us hints that there are problems in our garden.
[02:32:12.800 --> 02:32:16.460]  Every pest that comes in gives us some kind of a warning.
[02:32:16.460 --> 02:32:20.100]  If you were on top of your game, you've got some yellow sticky traps hanging up and you
[02:32:20.100 --> 02:32:22.860]  are checking those on a daily basis.
[02:32:22.860 --> 02:32:26.820]  They will give you a fair warning that you've got bugs coming in.
[02:32:26.820 --> 02:32:27.960]  You know how they'll tell you?
[02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:30.300]  There will be bugs stuck to the yellow card.
[02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:32.220]  How much more obvious can it get?
[02:32:32.220 --> 02:32:34.620]  So check the yellow sticky traps.
[02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:37.120]  Then walk every row.
[02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:40.100]  Every few feet, reach into the canopy and grab a leaf.
[02:32:40.100 --> 02:32:41.100]  Pull it right off.
[02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:42.400]  Flip it upside down.
[02:32:43.060 --> 02:32:45.960]  Do you see any bugs on the underside of the leaf?
[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:49.000]  Do you see any eggs on the underside of the leaf?
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.640]  Look at the top side of the leaf.
[02:32:50.640 --> 02:32:52.120]  Do you see any stippling?
[02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:53.380]  That is spider mite damage.
[02:32:53.380 --> 02:32:54.640]  Do you see any honeydew?
[02:32:54.640 --> 02:32:55.640]  That is thrip damage.
[02:32:55.640 --> 02:32:58.520]  Do you see anything that just doesn't look right?
[02:32:58.520 --> 02:33:02.360]  That could be a sign of overfeeding, underfeeding, or pH problems.
[02:33:02.360 --> 02:33:06.180]  Pay attention to the plants and they will tell you when something is starting to go
[02:33:06.180 --> 02:33:08.320]  wrong and you won't need to panic.
[02:33:08.320 --> 02:33:10.920]  So scout on a daily basis.
[02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:12.240]  Walk through the grow.
[02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:13.380]  Look at the plants.
[02:33:13.380 --> 02:33:14.780]  Look for mite damage.
[02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:16.120]  Look for thrip damage.
[02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:17.500]  Go smack the pots.
[02:33:17.500 --> 02:33:19.280]  Just give a couple pots a good smack.
[02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:20.600]  Does anything fly out?
[02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:22.720]  If so, you've got fungus gnats.
[02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:26.320]  Those are really easy to treat if you find them early.
[02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:27.680]  Scout for bugs.
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:30.400]  Teach all of your helpers to scout for bugs.
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:32.080]  Look for spider mite webbing.
[02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:34.680]  Also, look for powdery mildew.
[02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:36.920]  Look for anything that just doesn't look right.
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:42.640]  If you are a crew leader, teach people how to properly report the things that they see
[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:44.280]  so they know when to come to you.
[02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:46.760]  Some people say, ah, it doesn't look like a big deal.
[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:50.400]  Teach them what is a big deal and what is not a big deal.
[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:52.320]  So always be on the lookout for bugs.
[02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:54.440]  Always be scouting and know what you're looking for.
[02:33:54.440 --> 02:33:58.440]  You're looking for mites and mite damage, which is webbing, stippling.
[02:33:58.440 --> 02:33:59.800]  You're looking for thrip shit.
[02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:03.080]  You're looking for thrip honeydew, that glazy stuff on the lower leaves.
[02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:04.360]  That's from your thrips.
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:08.560]  When you tap the pots, those little black things that fly up, those are fungus gnats.
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:12.520]  When you shake the leaves, those little white bugs that fly out, those are white flies.
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:16.640]  Be aware of what you're looking for and constantly be looking for them.
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:20.840]  Healthy plants will be much more vigorous and much more productive than plants that
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:22.760]  are fighting off insects.
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:24.760]  Also, scouting is free.
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:28.080]  It doesn't cost you anything to walk through your grow and look for bugs.
[02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:29.320]  You should enjoy it.
[02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:30.440]  Put on a podcast.
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:31.960]  Put on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:33.320]  Throw on the Dude Grows.
[02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:37.840]  Put on some Joe Rogan and just stroll through the garden and go see what you can find today.
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:38.840]  Go find the problem.
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:40.960]  Chances are, there's something wrong.
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:42.120]  You just need to go find it.
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:44.040]  All right, I'll quit ranting about IPM.
[02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:46.940]  Hopefully I have inspired you to go look for bugs in your garden.
[02:34:46.940 --> 02:34:50.720]  You know what else is free that will really improve the quality of your garden overall
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:51.960]  is note-taking.
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:54.120]  Write down everything you do.
[02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:57.560]  That way when something goes wrong, you know what to blame it on and you know what not
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:34:58.640]  to do next time.
[02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:00.620]  I've done an entire episode on journaling.
[02:35:00.620 --> 02:35:02.680]  I'm not going to rant too much on that right now.
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:05.960]  I've got one more thing to talk about and then we're going to wrap up this podcast because
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:08.600]  my throat is starting to burn out.
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:13.360]  Another way we can increase productivity and vigor of our veg plants is to augment the
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:16.440]  CO2 levels in our grow room.
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:21.560]  The ambient CO2 level in your environment is probably hovering somewhere between 300
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:23.640]  and 400 particles per million.
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:25.560]  That is just about the standard on earth.
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:30.200]  My last research depends on where you are, your elevation, what kind of city you're in,
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:34.840]  but it's somewhere between 300 and 400 particles per million.
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:39.520]  Our plants would prefer somewhere around a thousand particles per million.
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:42.920]  They can take up to 1200, maybe 1500.
[02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:47.720]  I've even seen people push them closer to 2000 particles per million of CO2 and the
[02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:50.880]  plants just explode with vigorous growth.
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:54.960]  Now, there are several ways that you can increase the CO2 in your room.
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:59.280]  One thing I need to mention, once you start increasing the amount of CO2 in your grow
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:06.400]  room environment, it is very unhealthy for the plants to let the CO2 levels decline past
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:08.360]  what you have now increased it to.
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:13.160]  If you start boosting it to a thousand, you either need to keep it at a thousand or increase
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:14.540]  through flour.
[02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:18.000]  Your plant is expecting this CO2 as a new food source.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:21.440]  It is now feeding itself like it's got another food source.
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:25.080]  You have now put your plant into another level of high performance.
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:27.400]  It's expecting to get that high performance fuel.
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:33.680]  Once it's adjusted its diet accordingly, if you cut off that extra CO2, it will not
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:35.280]  be feeding itself properly.
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:38.040]  You will start seeing nutrient burn.
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:41.400]  Make sure you keep up on your CO2 habit if you start that habit.
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:45.760]  Also, if you run out and the plants start acting a little funny, that is probably what
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:46.760]  is causing it.
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:48.520]  They're still craving that CO2.
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:52.480]  They're still trying to readjust their metabolism because they're still on that high performance
[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:54.720]  mode and they're not sure what to do yet.
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:37:01.040]  That was my last tip for increasing performance and productivity and vigor of our veg plants.
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:04.840]  I shared a lot of my dirty secrets, a lot of the things that I use in my personal grows,
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:07.000]  a lot of things that I use in the commercial grows.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.040]  I hope you learned something from my talk today.
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:11.720]  I want to thank you guys again for listening.

[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:09.240]  I'll be back in just a few days with a fresh new episode.
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:10.520]  I want to thank you guys again for listening.
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:13.760]  I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy, Jesse James.
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:17.440]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:19.040]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:22.800]  It's time for episode 374 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:26.080]  This episode of the show is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:30.440]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:36.360]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:39.720]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:43.520]  I just took a gigantic dab of Sour Clem Ambrosia.
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:50.240]  The label says it has 71.1% THC and a total of 85.7% cannabinoids.
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:53.120]  It does not have much more information on the label here.
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:56.400]  This came from our friends at Apothecary Farms in Pueblo.
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:38:59.880]  That's right, Apothecary has recently opened a Pueblo location, so make sure you check
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:00.880]  that out.
[02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:03.680]  But today, I picked up the Sour Clem Ambrosia.
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:06.280]  I think it is sour diesel and clementine.
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:14.000]  It's got a really sweet, delicious, orangey, citrusy, clementine aroma, followed by a funky,
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:17.360]  sour diesel-y, just nasty aroma in the background.
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:19.520]  And I say nasty, but I mean it in the best way.
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:20.520]  It is delicious.
[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:21.520]  It is pungent.
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:23.160]  So it's a little sweet, it's a little sour.
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:25.640]  And then when you dab it, it goes straight to the brain.
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:27.120]  It makes your eyes open wide up.
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:28.120]  It makes you talk a lot.
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:29.180]  It makes you real rambly.
[02:39:29.180 --> 02:39:32.600]  So I think this will be great podcast dabs.
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:36.840]  Shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms and an extra big shout out to the Pueblo crew.
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:39.040]  I'm really digging this batch of Sour Clem Ambrosia.
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:41.840]  All right, you guys, let's jump into a podcast.
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:43.960]  I want to do another grow lesson.
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:46.200]  I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:50.720]  If you're a new listener, I suggest you go back to at least episode 351 and start on
[02:39:50.720 --> 02:39:52.380]  the grow lesson series.
[02:39:52.380 --> 02:39:55.160]  If you feel like you're caught up, welcome to the grow lessons.
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:59.380]  Today, we are going to do a before flower checkup.
[02:39:59.380 --> 02:40:03.180]  So far in my grow lessons, we should have healthy, happy veg plants that are in their
[02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:04.860]  final finishing pots.
[02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:07.260]  I suggested three, five or seven gallon pots.
[02:40:07.260 --> 02:40:09.260]  If you want to go larger, you do it your way.
[02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:10.980]  It is your grow.
[02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:12.140]  Hopefully you've topped these plants.
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:13.660]  You've got a nice canopy going.
[02:40:13.660 --> 02:40:16.380]  Hopefully you've got a big fat, healthy root system going.
[02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:19.460]  We're aiming for healthy, happy plants that are thriving.
[02:40:19.460 --> 02:40:21.220]  Hopefully we don't have any bugs.
[02:40:21.220 --> 02:40:23.020]  Hopefully you haven't over fertilized.
[02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:25.580]  Hopefully you haven't had any pH issues.
[02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:29.020]  Hopefully we haven't had any environmental problems that we didn't expect.
[02:40:29.020 --> 02:40:33.140]  Hopefully everything's going well and you've got big, fat, healthy plants that are almost
[02:40:33.140 --> 02:40:34.140]  ready to flower.
[02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:37.820]  They're probably about knee high at this point, maybe a little bit taller depending on what
[02:40:37.820 --> 02:40:41.580]  kind of lights you're using, what kind of genetics you're working with, how often you've
[02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:44.800]  been feeding them, what kind of treatment you've been giving them.
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:49.060]  Our plants are probably getting large enough to consider putting them into flower very
[02:40:49.060 --> 02:40:50.060]  soon.
[02:40:50.060 --> 02:40:53.980]  Before we go into flower, I feel like there are a few important points we should cover.
[02:40:53.980 --> 02:40:57.760]  So let's go over my before flower checkup.
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:03.380]  As it gets close to flower time, one of the first things I think about is, do I have clones?
[02:41:03.380 --> 02:41:04.840]  Do you have clones for the next run?
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:05.880]  Do you want to be self-sufficient?
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:12.720]  If so, you need to create clones for your next run before you put your plants into flower.
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:15.800]  I don't recommend taking clones from flowering plants.
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:16.800]  Some people will do it.
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:18.160]  Some people will teach you how to do it.
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:19.360]  That is not my style.
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:23.400]  I highly recommend that you get your clones from your vegging plants.
[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:26.720]  So before you put your plants into flower, do you have clones?
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:29.640]  Do you have a way to supply plants for your next cycle?
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:33.600]  If you plan on growing from seed again, or if you plan on purchasing new clones from
[02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:37.400]  a friend or a dispensary or however you get your clones, that's cool.
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:41.600]  If you're trying to be self-sufficient, now is the time to think about making clones from
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:43.520]  your current plants.
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:47.520]  Now if you decide that you want to be self-sufficient, you've got a couple of options.
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:51.360]  You may want to designate one of your clones as a mother plant.
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:53.360]  Here's the idea behind a mother plant.
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:59.120]  A mother plant is a clone of a plant that we have grown and tested and we know is reliable.
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:00.800]  We know that that plant is a female.
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:02.600]  We know that it puts off a good harvest weight.
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:03.600]  We know that it is potent.
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:04.960]  We know that it tastes good.
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:08.800]  And we hopefully have learned that it is pathogen and pest resistant.
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:12.440]  So we've got a reliable strain that we want to keep around in the garden.
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:16.520]  And the way we do that is just by keeping it in a vegetative stage perpetually.
[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:18.960]  And then we can take clones from it as needed.
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:23.880]  The way you keep that mother plant in a vegetative stage is by leaving it under at least 18 hours
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:26.180]  of light every day for mother plants.
[02:42:26.180 --> 02:42:28.640]  Sometimes I would recommend 20 on and 4 off.
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:32.820]  Maybe for stubborn mother plants, I may even go all the way up to 24 hours on.
[02:42:32.820 --> 02:42:35.960]  We've talked a little bit about that in previous episodes.
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:38.560]  I've also done a full episode about mother plants.
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:44.200]  I suggest you check out episode 315 for a full breakdown of mother plants.
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:47.860]  Now if you don't have room and space for an extra plant, maybe you just can't have that
[02:42:47.860 --> 02:42:51.220]  extra plant because of your plant count, because of state laws.
[02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:55.540]  Another option is to clone off of your veg plants perpetually.
[02:42:55.540 --> 02:42:59.660]  A lot of people will say that will create something we used to call genetic drift.
[02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:00.860]  I do not believe in that.
[02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:04.620]  If the plants are healthy, I've done a full episode on that as well.
[02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:05.620]  Let's get back on track.
[02:43:05.620 --> 02:43:09.340]  The idea of taking clones from your veg plants is very simple.
[02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:10.540]  You've got veg plants.
[02:43:10.540 --> 02:43:12.220]  They're about to go into flower.
[02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:15.860]  Right before you take them into the flower room, take a couple of clones off of each
[02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:17.420]  of your veg plants.
[02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:21.580]  If you have faith in your clone taking skills and you don't have room for an extra mother
[02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:23.900]  plant, this is an ideal way to do things.
[02:43:23.900 --> 02:43:27.900]  Again, some people may claim that this will result in genetic drift.
[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:30.060]  I do not believe in genetic drift.
[02:43:30.060 --> 02:43:34.580]  I don't believe in it so much that I have changed my vocabulary to where I call what
[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:38.060]  is known as genetic drift to regenerative mutation.
[02:43:38.060 --> 02:43:40.380]  I've done a full episode on genetic drift.
[02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:43.840]  If you'd like to learn more about it, I recommend you listen to the episode.
[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:47.380]  And that's episode number 343 and it's actually titled genetic drift.
[02:43:47.380 --> 02:43:53.020]  I suggest you give it a listen and understand why we now call it regenerative mutation.
[02:43:53.020 --> 02:43:57.300]  So the point of that rant is to make sure that you have got clones for your next run.
[02:43:57.300 --> 02:44:01.540]  If you don't have a supplier, a provider, or a source for your next batch of clones,
[02:44:01.540 --> 02:44:05.780]  it may be really advantageous to take a few clones, start vegging them out so that way
[02:44:05.780 --> 02:44:09.860]  you've got another crop lined up before you even have this one finished.
[02:44:09.860 --> 02:44:13.420]  If you really want to max productivity of your grow, you'll start running what is known
[02:44:13.420 --> 02:44:15.940]  as a perpetual grow where you use two spaces.
[02:44:15.940 --> 02:44:16.940]  You've got a veg space.
[02:44:16.940 --> 02:44:18.420]  You've got a flowering space.
[02:44:18.420 --> 02:44:22.940]  As soon as that flowering crop is done, you cut it down, you clean the room, you reset
[02:44:22.940 --> 02:44:27.940]  the room and you drag a set of flowering plants right back in there and you never miss a beat.
[02:44:27.940 --> 02:44:29.340]  That room never gets a break.
[02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:32.860]  So you're always on top of production, which means you always have to have a supply of
[02:44:32.860 --> 02:44:33.860]  clones.
[02:44:33.860 --> 02:44:36.780]  So you'll have veg plants, you'll cut a few clones off of them.
[02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:38.540]  You'll cut down your flowering plants.
[02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:42.060]  You'll clean up that room, drag those veg plants right into there, and then you'll start
[02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:44.260]  growing those little clones up into the next batch.
[02:44:44.260 --> 02:44:45.860]  They'll be your veg plants.
[02:44:45.860 --> 02:44:46.860]  You have to top them.
[02:44:46.860 --> 02:44:47.860]  You have to train them.
[02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:51.740]  You've got a full nine weeks to get them as big as you need them and get them prepared
[02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:53.020]  for the next run.
[02:44:53.020 --> 02:44:56.580]  So when that flowering crop gets done that you've got in the flowering room, you cut
[02:44:56.580 --> 02:45:00.100]  it down, clean it up, drag those veg plants right in there.
[02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:04.140]  But before you do that, you take a few clones so that you can keep the cycle going.
[02:45:04.140 --> 02:45:08.660]  The idea is to create a perpetual cycle for yourself so you're always self-sufficient.
[02:45:08.660 --> 02:45:11.220]  You never have to bring anything in from outside.
[02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:12.900]  That way you can keep the grow clean.
[02:45:12.900 --> 02:45:15.500]  That way you know if you get any bugs or any pests, it's your fault.
[02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:17.340]  You can't blame anybody else.
[02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:20.300]  But it really limits the opportunities to bring in problems.
[02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:23.580]  And it also helps you develop a relationship with one strain.
[02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:27.780]  If you run a perpetual grow with just one, maybe two strains max, you can really dial
[02:45:27.780 --> 02:45:28.780]  those strains in.
[02:45:28.780 --> 02:45:32.020]  You can build a relationship with them, and then you can get them to reach their full
[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:33.020]  potential.
[02:45:33.020 --> 02:45:35.860]  There are several ways to do perpetual grows.
[02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:37.900]  You can do it by swapping the whole room.
[02:45:37.900 --> 02:45:40.940]  You can do it by having part of the room harvest every couple of weeks.
[02:45:40.940 --> 02:45:43.020]  I've done a full episode on that.
[02:45:43.020 --> 02:45:47.620]  But I do plan to redo it in the future for a six-plant count because Colorado is now
[02:45:47.620 --> 02:45:51.300]  limited to six plants for recreational or medical patients.
[02:45:51.300 --> 02:45:56.780]  So I will do a revised perpetual grow episode based on a six-plant count.
[02:45:56.780 --> 02:46:01.700]  If you're interested in listening to the current or maybe the old scheduling a perpetual grow
[02:46:01.700 --> 02:46:04.020]  episode, that is episode number 73.
[02:46:04.020 --> 02:46:05.300]  I think it is a great episode.
[02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:09.180]  I put a lot of time and effort into creating that episode.
[02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:12.540]  So episode 73, all about creating a perpetual grow.
[02:46:12.540 --> 02:46:14.700]  All right, let me get myself back on track.
[02:46:14.700 --> 02:46:19.260]  My point is to make sure you have got either a source for clones or clones for your next
[02:46:19.260 --> 02:46:20.260]  run.
[02:46:20.260 --> 02:46:24.220]  And also, it is always a good idea to think about becoming more self-sufficient, and you
[02:46:24.220 --> 02:46:28.220]  can do so by creating a perpetual grow.
[02:46:28.220 --> 02:46:32.240]  Now the next thing on my checklist that I would think about in this brand new grow room
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:36.380]  that we just recently built is, do we have any light leaks?
[02:46:36.380 --> 02:46:39.460]  Do we have grow lights leaking out into the outside?
[02:46:39.460 --> 02:46:42.540]  And do we have outside lights leaking into the inside?
[02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:46.740]  This is very important to find out before we go into the flower phase.
[02:46:46.740 --> 02:46:52.020]  We need to go in that grow room and turn off the grow lights and sit in there for 15 or
[02:46:52.020 --> 02:46:57.980]  20 minutes and let your eyes adjust to the total darkness and see if you see any light
[02:46:57.980 --> 02:47:00.660]  at all in your flowering room.
[02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:03.360]  If you can see any light, that is too much.
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:06.440]  You should not be able to see your hand in front of your own face.
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:08.160]  It needs to be completely dark.
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:10.160]  I've done an episode called Total Darkness.
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:12.080]  Check that one out also.
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:15.720]  Any light leaks in the flowering phase are going to cause your plants problems.
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:20.160]  You're either going to get no flowering at all, you're going to get slow flowering, or
[02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:21.600]  you're going to get hermaphrodites.
[02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:24.920]  You'll get plants that'll start to flower and they'll never finish, or you just may
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:28.880]  get crazy weird mutated plants because of an odd light leak.
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:33.160]  So go in the grow room, turn off all the grow lights, and just sit there for a few minutes.
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:34.320]  Put your phone away.
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:36.800]  Don't have any light making your eyes do weird things.
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:38.360]  Just let there be total darkness.
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:39.360]  Let your eyes adjust.
[02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:42.000]  And if you see any light, you need to correct it.
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:45.360]  You need some of that silver foil tape, or maybe you need to fill the gaps with some
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:47.640]  caulk and cover it up with some duct tape.
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:50.000]  Just seal up all of those light leaks.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:56.360]  Now if your grow room is on an exterior wall, meaning that wall is next to the outside,
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:01.400]  or if there is a lot of activity on the opposite side of the wall of which you are growing,
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:06.960]  I suggest you go in your grow room and turn off the grow lights during either the sunshine
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:12.240]  hours or the busy hours of that room, and see if any of the light from either the sun
[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:17.160]  or that adjacent room are leaking into your grow room during their busy hours.
[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:20.760]  If your grow room has a window and the sun is shining on that window and the curtains
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:24.480]  aren't thick enough to block out that sun, or whatever you've put over that window is
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:28.680]  not thick enough to block out that sunlight, we need to know that before we go into the
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:30.600]  flowering phase.
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:34.080]  The sun may come up an hour before your grow lights come on.
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:38.800]  They may start getting a full hour of sunlight coming through that window that you're unaware
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:42.020]  of and that's going to disrupt their flowering cycle.
[02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:46.940]  So go in there and check at all hours and see if you are getting total darkness, especially
[02:48:46.940 --> 02:48:50.640]  the hours you plan on putting your plants in their night cycle.
[02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:55.120]  Make sure that room is actually dark, and if it's not, correct it.
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:57.560]  Now the next thing we need to do is the opposite.
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:01.560]  We need to go outside and make sure that none of our grow room lights are leaking to
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:06.320]  the outside, especially if you're running your grow lights during the outside night
[02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:07.320]  cycle.
[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:10.060]  You are lighting up the outside neighborhood with your grow lights.
[02:49:10.060 --> 02:49:12.280]  Those grow lights are going to bring unwanted attention.
[02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:14.520]  You will bring thieves and law enforcement.
[02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:18.600]  So make sure you're not leaking any light out of your grow room.
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:22.600]  Now is also a good time to start thinking about, when am I going to run my flowering
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:23.600]  cycle?
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:26.680]  Do you want the lights on when it's dark outside?
[02:49:26.680 --> 02:49:29.960]  Do you want the lights on when it's light outside?
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:34.080]  Electricity is cheaper during off-peak hours, which means when all the business is closed
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:37.160]  and everybody goes home, electricity gets cheaper.
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:41.880]  You can look on your bill and find out when peak and off-peak hours are.
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:46.580]  Since electricity is more affordable at off-peak hours, many growers will choose to run their
[02:49:46.580 --> 02:49:48.600]  lights during those hours.
[02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:53.480]  Also, when the sun is not up, we don't have to try to keep the room cool with the grow
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:56.220]  lights and the sun competing against us.
[02:49:56.260 --> 02:49:59.900]  When the sun goes down, it automatically gets a little bit cooler outside.
[02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:03.940]  You can fire up your grow lights and you don't have as much heat to deal with.
[02:50:03.940 --> 02:50:07.500]  If you're in a place that gets really cold, you can run those grow lights at night and
[02:50:07.500 --> 02:50:11.380]  it will really help keep your house warm if you've got a small house and you run the ducting
[02:50:11.380 --> 02:50:13.500]  right and you plan properly.
[02:50:13.500 --> 02:50:17.340]  I know several East Coast growers that used to keep their apartments warm by setting up
[02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:20.100]  a four or 600 watt light in the winter.
[02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:24.900]  It would kick out a small winter crop of super potent cannabis out of their very small apartment
[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:28.060]  and they would also use that same light to keep themselves warm.
[02:50:28.060 --> 02:50:31.360]  So it's a very efficient way to do things back in the day.
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:34.900]  So now is a good time to start thinking about when you're going to run your lights in your
[02:50:34.900 --> 02:50:36.100]  flowering room.
[02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:38.140]  You probably have to go to work part of the day.
[02:50:38.140 --> 02:50:41.500]  Do you want those lights to come on right when you get home from work?
[02:50:41.500 --> 02:50:45.180]  Do you want those lights to come on so you can work on the plants before you go to work?
[02:50:45.180 --> 02:50:47.580]  You've got a lot of things to plan and think about now.
[02:50:47.580 --> 02:50:51.460]  I suggest you work on the plants after work because you don't want to go to work smelling
[02:50:51.460 --> 02:50:52.840]  like dank.
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:57.200]  Most people work a day job nowadays, so you're going to go to work and then you'll get off
[02:50:57.200 --> 02:51:00.040]  hopefully in the evening, come home, work on the plants.
[02:51:00.040 --> 02:51:04.000]  That works out really well because you are now on off peak electricity hours and it is
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.120]  nighttime so you're not fighting that heat.
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:08.060]  You don't have to run as much electricity.
[02:51:08.060 --> 02:51:12.080]  So you get off work, come home, work on the plants, then you can take a nice shower.
[02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:15.320]  Then you don't stink for work next day and nobody knows that you're growing cannabis.
[02:51:15.320 --> 02:51:17.680]  If you were in a place, you need to keep it on the down low.
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:18.680]  All right.
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:22.360]  So once I'm talking about being careful and keeping it on the down low, do you have a
[02:51:22.360 --> 02:51:24.000]  carbon filter set up?
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:25.520]  Is your filtration in place?
[02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:28.720]  Are you ready for a stinky crop of flowers?
[02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:32.800]  In just a few weeks, these plants are going to start stinking very heavily.
[02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:37.620]  You may get a nice aroma around 20 days in, depending on your genetics and what you're
[02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:40.760]  using for nutrients and the airflow in your room.
[02:51:40.760 --> 02:51:44.060]  Now is the time to order a carbon filter if you haven't already.
[02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:45.200]  You need to get that set up.
[02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:48.960]  You need to get it in place and you need to start controlling the aroma leaving your
[02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:50.640]  grow space.
[02:51:50.640 --> 02:51:54.160]  Now I need to back up and cover one thing that I overlooked when I was talking about
[02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:55.640]  light leaks.
[02:51:55.640 --> 02:52:01.240]  When you are using vented lights, which means you have got a light with glass between the
[02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:06.040]  bulb and the plant canopy and that's all sealed up in there and it's got a duct coming off
[02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:09.920]  of one end and off of the other and you're blowing a blower over it to get that heat
[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:12.280]  from the light out of the grow space.
[02:52:12.280 --> 02:52:15.760]  A lot of people will run that ducting to the outside of the house.
[02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:20.080]  They'll run it out of a window just to make it go outside of the house somehow.
[02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:25.760]  A lot of times the sunshine will reflect right down that ducting and come into your light
[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:28.760]  reflector and work just like a light.
[02:52:28.760 --> 02:52:32.960]  You are channeling that light down that ducting right into your grow space.
[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:37.500]  If you are not doing that while the lights are on, you are lighting up the plants and
[02:52:37.500 --> 02:52:39.640]  disrupting your night cycle.
[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:45.060]  If you were using ducted hoods and you were running that to the outside of the house,
[02:52:45.060 --> 02:52:51.400]  you may need to adjust the duct to where the light does not make it into your grow room.
[02:52:51.400 --> 02:52:56.720]  Unfortunately, the inside of that ducting is quite often made with a very reflective
[02:52:56.720 --> 02:52:57.920]  material.
[02:52:57.920 --> 02:53:02.860]  You're probably going to have to give it a lot of bends or you'll have to create a baffle
[02:53:02.860 --> 02:53:08.400]  at the end of it to where the light is not allowed to even enter down that ducting.
[02:53:08.400 --> 02:53:15.040]  Another option is to get a can of flat black spray paint and spray paint the inside as
[02:53:15.040 --> 02:53:17.240]  far as you can make that spray paint go.
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:21.120]  Just put a nice little black layer in there and take that reflective layer off and that
[02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:24.240]  will prevent the light from getting in there as much.
[02:53:24.240 --> 02:53:26.020]  You still may need to make a bend.
[02:53:26.020 --> 02:53:31.920]  You may need to put some sort of light baffle over it, but please check and see if the light
[02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:36.400]  is coming through your ducted hoods and disrupting your night cycle.
[02:53:36.400 --> 02:53:42.240]  The sunshine will make it so far down that ducting, you will be amazed.
[02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:47.240]  Just one little speckle of sunlight will completely disrupt your flowering cycle.
[02:53:47.240 --> 02:53:50.840]  If you think the plants are in the dark and they're getting that one little pinprick of
[02:53:50.840 --> 02:53:52.920]  sunlight, they're not in the dark.
[02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:56.080]  Also, take a quick look at all of the equipment in your grow room.
[02:53:56.080 --> 02:53:58.760]  Does your air conditioner have blue and red lights on it?
[02:53:58.760 --> 02:54:02.040]  Is there something in the grow room that's illuminating a blue display?
[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:05.840]  If you have any lights in there, you need to put some tape or some sort of a flap over
[02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:09.360]  it so that light does not disrupt your flowering cycle.
[02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:14.680]  The only color of light that is acceptable during the night cycle is a green light.
[02:54:14.680 --> 02:54:19.280]  And there are still situations where I have seen those green lights cause problems with
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:24.120]  people's plants by running that green light too much during a dark cycle.
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:27.760]  I would prefer it be completely dark in your grow room.
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:28.760]  There's nobody in there.
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:30.120]  The plants are sleeping.
[02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:31.720]  We don't want any light.
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:33.420]  Make it as dark as you can get it.
[02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:36.740]  You want it scary dark and then a little bit darker.
[02:54:36.740 --> 02:54:39.960]  You don't want to be able to see your hand in front of your face when you're touching
[02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:41.060]  your nose.
[02:54:41.060 --> 02:54:42.220]  That's how dark we need it.
[02:54:42.220 --> 02:54:44.860]  Again, I've done an episode called Total Darkness.
[02:54:44.860 --> 02:54:49.060]  So give that one a listen if you don't understand why total darkness is so important in our
[02:54:49.060 --> 02:54:50.260]  indoor grow environment.
[02:54:50.260 --> 02:54:51.260]  All right.
[02:54:51.260 --> 02:54:58.060]  The next thing on my pre-flower checklist is can you correctly identify females, males,
[02:54:58.060 --> 02:54:59.780]  and hermaphrodites?
[02:54:59.780 --> 02:55:06.020]  If you are running from seed especially, you have got the option to run into females, males,
[02:55:06.020 --> 02:55:07.900]  or hermaphrodites.
[02:55:07.900 --> 02:55:11.540]  You need to be able to identify these very early.
[02:55:11.540 --> 02:55:16.780]  If you find a male in the garden, it needs to be cold immediately.
[02:55:16.780 --> 02:55:20.900]  If you come across a hermaphroditic plant early in flower, you need to know what that
[02:55:20.900 --> 02:55:26.020]  looks like so you can get it out of the grow room before it causes you problems.
[02:55:26.020 --> 02:55:31.180]  Your plants are going to start showing sex somewhere around 10 days into flower.
[02:55:31.180 --> 02:55:36.720]  By day 12 or 14, it will be really obvious if you've got male or female plants.
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:42.820]  By day 12 or 14, your female plants will be able to receive pollen from the male plants.
[02:55:42.820 --> 02:55:48.540]  If you're not paying attention, sometimes by day 10 or 12, a male plant can open up
[02:55:48.540 --> 02:55:50.220]  and start dropping pollen.
[02:55:50.220 --> 02:55:52.260]  Now your whole crop is pollinated.
[02:55:52.260 --> 02:55:55.560]  Everything is going to have seeds in it and you didn't even know because you weren't paying
[02:55:56.100 --> 02:55:57.100]  attention.
[02:55:57.100 --> 02:56:02.560]  So before we get to this risky phase, open up some books, do some Google searches, and
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:05.680]  learn to identify a female cannabis plant.
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:11.120]  Learn to confidently identify a male cannabis plant and learn how to identify a plant that
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:14.500]  shows both sexes in the same plant.
[02:56:14.500 --> 02:56:18.400]  In the next episode, I plan to talk about phenohunting and selecting a mother plant
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:19.840]  from that phenohunt.
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:24.240]  In that episode, I will also include a talk about sexing our cannabis plants.
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:27.400]  It is very important at this phase and this stage of the game.
[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:31.760]  So we need to know how to confidently identify males and females.
[02:56:31.760 --> 02:56:37.360]  I will be able to provide you detailed descriptions, but I recommend you look online for pictures
[02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:40.080]  of males and females of cannabis plants.
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:41.800]  They are very easy to spot.
[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:44.520]  Once you look a few times, it will become very obvious.
[02:56:44.520 --> 02:56:46.960]  You just need to develop the confidence.
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:51.480]  So I will include a talk about it on the next episode, but you will still need to go look
[02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:56.560]  in a book or look online and get a good visual understanding of what you are looking for
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:57:00.960]  so you can spot it right away if something should pop up in your garden.
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:04.800]  Now another thing you should think about before you put your plants into flower is, are they
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:05.800]  healthy?
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:07.360]  Have you burned them with nutrients?
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:08.840]  Are they nutrient deficient?
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:12.160]  We may want to get them a little healthier before you put them into flower.
[02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:15.840]  We want these plants as healthy as we can get them before they go into the flowering
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:16.920]  phase.
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:22.360]  Another important thing to think about is, do you have any pest infestations?
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:26.840]  We aren't able to spray the plants with as many products once we get bud set, so we want
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:32.940]  to eradicate any pest problems before we go into the flowering phase.
[02:57:32.940 --> 02:57:37.160]  If you do have a pest problem at this time, it is time to step up the frequency of the
[02:57:37.160 --> 02:57:42.560]  sprays and quite possibly increase the potency of your sprays, if not start introducing new
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:44.040]  products.
[02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:47.520]  We do not want to enter the flowering phase with a known pest problem.
[02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:53.440]  It is much easier to combat a pest problem while in veg, so let's focus on getting rid
[02:57:53.440 --> 02:57:58.120]  of any problems now and then we can move to flower a week late if that's what we need
[02:57:58.120 --> 02:58:03.640]  to do or we can adjust our plans accordingly, but let's make sure to get rid of every bug
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:05.540]  before we move to flower.
[02:58:05.540 --> 02:58:08.620]  So at this point we should have some backup clones for the next run.
[02:58:08.620 --> 02:58:12.440]  We know that the room is dark, we know there are no light leaks, there's no light getting
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:14.020]  in, there's no light getting out.
[02:58:14.020 --> 02:58:18.380]  We've got our aroma control, there's no stinky air getting out of the grow room.
[02:58:18.380 --> 02:58:22.540]  You guys, the number one way people get in trouble is by having stinky air coming out
[02:58:22.540 --> 02:58:23.540]  of the house.
[02:58:23.540 --> 02:58:26.140]  Control that aroma, make sure you take care of that.
[02:58:26.140 --> 02:58:28.620]  We're allowed to grow cannabis in Colorado.
[02:58:28.620 --> 02:58:32.960]  You were just fine until somebody complains and says they can smell your garden.
[02:58:32.960 --> 02:58:36.920]  At that point, they send out an investigator and they come knock on your door and ask to
[02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:39.260]  look and see how many plants you've got.
[02:58:39.260 --> 02:58:41.900]  If you've got too many plants, you do get in trouble.
[02:58:41.900 --> 02:58:46.660]  So no matter how many plants you've got, I recommend you've got some sort of odor control
[02:58:46.660 --> 02:58:50.460]  so none of your neighbors get mad, nobody snitches on you, nobody comes knocking on
[02:58:50.460 --> 02:58:51.460]  your door.
[02:58:51.460 --> 02:58:55.620]  Even if you are within your legal amount of plants, it is still nerve wracking and stressful
[02:58:55.620 --> 02:58:58.780]  to have to deal with law enforcement because of your cannabis.
[02:58:58.780 --> 02:59:01.460]  So simply control the odor.
[02:59:01.460 --> 02:59:03.620]  So again, we've got clones for the next round.
[02:59:03.620 --> 02:59:05.020]  We've got a nice dark room.
[02:59:05.020 --> 02:59:07.900]  We're controlling the odor that is leaving our room.
[02:59:07.900 --> 02:59:11.260]  We know how to identify males, females, and hermaphrodites.
[02:59:11.260 --> 02:59:14.460]  We know what to cull so that we don't cause any problems in the grow so that we don't
[02:59:14.460 --> 02:59:16.380]  seed up our whole grow.
[02:59:16.380 --> 02:59:17.740]  We know there are no pests.
[02:59:17.740 --> 02:59:19.780]  We know we haven't overfed the plants.
[02:59:19.780 --> 02:59:22.020]  We are almost ready to flower.
[02:59:22.020 --> 02:59:24.700]  Now how do we know when to flower these plants?
[02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:28.740]  There are a couple of things that will help us determine when to initiate the flowering
[02:59:28.740 --> 02:59:30.940]  phase for our plants.
[02:59:30.940 --> 02:59:33.540]  One of the main factors will be the height.
[02:59:33.540 --> 02:59:36.700]  How much ceiling space do you have in your grow?
[02:59:36.700 --> 02:59:38.860]  Most of us are in a residential area.
[02:59:38.860 --> 02:59:42.860]  A lot of us are going to be modifying a bedroom or something similar.
[02:59:42.860 --> 02:59:45.580]  A lot of us may be using grow tents.
[02:59:45.580 --> 02:59:48.940]  You're going to have to flower your plants at a height to where they have plenty of room
[02:59:48.940 --> 02:59:53.740]  to grow to where they don't work themselves into the lights and you run out of space.
[02:59:53.740 --> 02:59:57.780]  You need to plan to leave, depending on what type of light you're using, you need to plan
[02:59:57.780 --> 03:00:02.420]  to leave an appropriate gap between the top of your plants and your light source.
[03:00:02.420 --> 03:00:05.340]  If you're using LEDs, you can get much closer.
[03:00:05.340 --> 03:00:08.580]  If you're using the ceramic metal halides, you can get kind of close.
[03:00:08.580 --> 03:00:12.660]  If you're using a high pressure sodium light, you need to stay kind of a distance away.
[03:00:12.660 --> 03:00:16.340]  If you're using a double ended Govita, you need to stay even further away.
[03:00:16.340 --> 03:00:20.500]  So plan for that when you're planning your flowering time.
[03:00:20.500 --> 03:00:23.900]  Now a good thing to think of when you were new at growing and you haven't grown a lot
[03:00:23.900 --> 03:00:28.660]  of crops and you want to prepare for flowering time and have enough space is prepare for
[03:00:28.660 --> 03:00:31.420]  your plants to double in height.
[03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:36.540]  If you were growing a sativa strain or something, a sativa hybrid with a lot of sativa genetics
[03:00:36.540 --> 03:00:41.100]  in there, it could double in height throughout the flowering phase.
[03:00:41.100 --> 03:00:45.220]  So if you vege your plant and the plant is three feet tall, you initiate flower.
[03:00:45.220 --> 03:00:50.580]  By the time it is done, you can expect a six foot tall plant if you're not doing anything
[03:00:50.580 --> 03:00:53.140]  to control that vertical growth.
[03:00:53.140 --> 03:00:56.020]  So in that case, I would plan to flower that plant.
[03:00:56.020 --> 03:00:59.580]  If you have got, if your light is six feet tall, we're going to say if your light is
[03:00:59.580 --> 03:01:02.500]  seven feet tall because we need some space.
[03:01:02.500 --> 03:01:06.380]  If your light is seven feet off the ground, I would veg those plants the first time I
[03:01:06.380 --> 03:01:07.380]  grow them.
[03:01:07.380 --> 03:01:09.940]  I would veg them until they are three feet tall.
[03:01:09.940 --> 03:01:12.860]  Once they are three feet tall, initiate the flower phase.
[03:01:12.860 --> 03:01:14.060]  They're going to double in height.
[03:01:14.060 --> 03:01:15.580]  They'll end about six feet tall.
[03:01:15.580 --> 03:01:19.380]  You'll still have that one foot of space between the light and the canopy.
[03:01:19.380 --> 03:01:20.880]  Now this is not a rule.
[03:01:20.880 --> 03:01:22.520]  This is just a guide.
[03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:25.760]  If you have not grown your strain before, if you don't know what these genetics are
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:29.860]  going to do, allow yourself room for these plants to double.
[03:01:29.860 --> 03:01:33.940]  Of course, if you've got plants with big, obvious fat white indica leaves, you may not
[03:01:33.940 --> 03:01:35.540]  get that doubled growth.
[03:01:35.540 --> 03:01:37.300]  You may only get a little bit of growth.
[03:01:37.300 --> 03:01:41.300]  You're going to get stretch for about three weeks and then they'll slow down on the stretching
[03:01:41.300 --> 03:01:43.820]  and the bud sets will really set in.
[03:01:43.820 --> 03:01:47.820]  But try to plan ahead for too much headspace.
[03:01:47.820 --> 03:01:53.100]  There's nothing worse than having a big, giant, beautiful top cola that is just beefy and
[03:01:53.100 --> 03:01:58.180]  covered in trichomes and then it starts murdering itself by growing directly into your lights.
[03:01:58.180 --> 03:01:59.340]  It starts touching the light.
[03:01:59.340 --> 03:02:00.460]  It starts burning itself.
[03:02:00.460 --> 03:02:01.700]  It starts getting ugly colors.
[03:02:01.700 --> 03:02:04.060]  You have to think about, do I want to bend that bud over?
[03:02:04.060 --> 03:02:05.860]  Do I actually want to cut part of that off?
[03:02:05.860 --> 03:02:07.540]  What do I do at this point?
[03:02:07.540 --> 03:02:08.780]  That is really heartbreaking.
[03:02:08.780 --> 03:02:12.820]  So plan ahead and try to give yourself plenty of headspace.
[03:02:12.820 --> 03:02:14.620]  Also keep in mind spacing.
[03:02:14.620 --> 03:02:17.480]  You don't want the plants touching each other too much.
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:21.060]  Just think about if you and I and another couple of dudes were hanging out in a room,
[03:02:21.060 --> 03:02:24.500]  if we all just started spreading our arms around, just touching each other all weird,
[03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:25.500]  you're going to get kind of weirded out.
[03:02:25.500 --> 03:02:27.060]  You're like, bro, why are you touching me?
[03:02:27.060 --> 03:02:28.940]  And you're going to want your own space.
[03:02:28.940 --> 03:02:30.820]  The plants are very similar.
[03:02:30.820 --> 03:02:34.540]  When one plant feels another plant touch it, it indicates to itself, I probably shouldn't
[03:02:34.540 --> 03:02:37.660]  grow much further that way because I'm already touching a limit.
[03:02:37.660 --> 03:02:39.180]  And the other plant says the same thing.
[03:02:39.180 --> 03:02:42.100]  So now you've got two plants that have just stopped out branching and they're going to
[03:02:42.100 --> 03:02:43.400]  start growing up.
[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:46.300]  So allow your plants plenty of space.
[03:02:46.300 --> 03:02:47.460]  Spread them out a little bit.
[03:02:47.460 --> 03:02:50.180]  Yes, we do want to maximize canopy space.
[03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:54.780]  We do want to maximize the space of our grow, but we don't want to crush them in so much
[03:02:54.780 --> 03:02:56.280]  we can't get airflow.
[03:02:56.280 --> 03:02:59.160]  We don't want to crush them in so much that they're uncomfortable.
[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:02.960]  We need a little bit of airflow and we don't want leaves stacking on top of each other
[03:03:02.960 --> 03:03:05.260]  because that's where you start causing problems.
[03:03:05.260 --> 03:03:09.120]  So give them some space, space your plants out, give them some breathing room, give them
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:10.620]  some growing room.
[03:03:10.620 --> 03:03:14.640]  And keep in mind that when you put your plants into the flowering phase, they are only halfway
[03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:15.840]  through their life cycle.
[03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:17.560]  They still need to bush out a little bit.
[03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:18.840]  They're going to grow much taller.
[03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:20.560]  You're only halfway there.
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:23.800]  So allow that extra space for flowering.
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:27.680]  Now if you're running a screen of green or a trellis system, I suggest you veg until
[03:03:27.680 --> 03:03:30.480]  you kind of fill out most of that screen system.
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:34.800]  The idea is to try to get one little branch coming through each of those squares in your
[03:03:34.800 --> 03:03:35.800]  trellis system.
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:40.160]  If you can maximize that, that's when you really start cranking out as much bud as you
[03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:42.340]  can produce in your space.
[03:03:42.340 --> 03:03:47.680]  So I suggest you fill that canopy up and fill that screen up before you flower because you're
[03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:49.040]  spreading it out nice and wide.
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:51.720]  It's not going straight up like the guys without the screen.
[03:03:51.720 --> 03:03:55.400]  If you're spreading it out, you've still got all that vertical growth left for you.
[03:03:55.400 --> 03:03:58.760]  So you can spread it out, then put it into flower and it's going to grow vertically for
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:03:59.760]  you.
[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:02.960]  So I recommend you use all of that screen space to the best of your ability.
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:07.000]  All right, I feel like that is a good explanation of when to flower the plants.
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.800]  You want to give yourself about double the space.
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:13.200]  You want to allow some space between the lights and the plants.
[03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:17.000]  You also want to give the plants some space so they can breathe and so they can stretch
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:18.000]  out.
[03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:22.880]  If you haven't done any topping, I would definitely recommend 10 to 14 days of recovery time before
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:24.640]  you move the plants into flower.
[03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:29.600]  So plan ahead, do all of your topping plenty of time in advance so the plants can heal,
[03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:31.600]  so they can redistribute the hormones.
[03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:34.700]  That way the plant can produce big fat chunky top buds.
[03:04:34.700 --> 03:04:38.720]  If you top a plant and move it into flower too soon, you'll notice those top buds don't
[03:04:38.720 --> 03:04:41.320]  really produce the colas that we're expecting.
[03:04:41.320 --> 03:04:45.120]  So give your plant time to recover from topping, let those hormones move around and it will
[03:04:45.240 --> 03:04:48.520]  make a huge difference in the productivity of your plant.
[03:04:48.520 --> 03:04:52.160]  So I feel like that is a pretty good before flower checklist.
[03:04:52.160 --> 03:04:53.600]  Make sure the plants are healthy.
[03:04:53.600 --> 03:04:57.180]  Make sure you understand how to find males, females, and hermaphrodites.
[03:04:57.180 --> 03:05:01.960]  Make sure you're pest free and make sure you've got a good idea of when to flower those plants.
[03:05:01.960 --> 03:05:06.600]  Try to set a schedule, try to stick to it as long as you are pest free.
[03:05:06.600 --> 03:05:10.440]  I would suggest that you keep twisting and popping the stems, making those stalks nice
[03:05:10.440 --> 03:05:12.900]  and robust until it's time to flower.
[03:05:12.900 --> 03:05:15.260]  Keep pulling off any yellow or funky leaves.
[03:05:15.260 --> 03:05:17.060]  Keep the plants looking nice and healthy.
[03:05:17.060 --> 03:05:18.060]  Keep them thriving.
[03:05:18.060 --> 03:05:22.940]  And when it's time to flower, flip that timer to 12-12, make a note of what day you did
[03:05:22.940 --> 03:05:26.260]  it and now you are in the flowering phase.
[03:05:26.260 --> 03:05:29.160]  Several people have asked me when flowering starts.
[03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:33.400]  Does flowering start the day you change the timer to 12-12 or does flowering start the
[03:05:33.400 --> 03:05:35.400]  day you start seeing buds set?
[03:05:35.400 --> 03:05:39.900]  If you are looking at a package of seeds and it says these seeds will take 8-10 weeks to
[03:05:39.900 --> 03:05:46.260]  flower, that 8-10 weeks starts the day you change your timer to 12-12.
[03:05:46.260 --> 03:05:49.860]  The day you do the flip is the beginning of your flowering phase.
[03:05:49.860 --> 03:05:55.540]  That's when that new schedule, that new calendar, the new countdown, that is when that begins.
[03:05:55.540 --> 03:06:01.580]  So if you were running 24 hours or 20 on and 4 off or 18 and 6 in veg, you just go in and
[03:06:01.580 --> 03:06:07.060]  you change that timer to 12 hours on and 12 hours off and that is day one of your flowering
[03:06:07.060 --> 03:06:08.060]  phase.
[03:06:08.380 --> 03:06:12.620]  In about 10-12 days, you'll start seeing pre-flower, the plants will start showing you sex, you
[03:06:12.620 --> 03:06:16.140]  need to go through and start pulling out all of the boys by this point.
[03:06:16.140 --> 03:06:21.260]  By day 14, the boys will be very obvious, they will be getting ready to pollinate if
[03:06:21.260 --> 03:06:23.620]  they have not already dropped pollen.
[03:06:23.620 --> 03:06:26.800]  Pay close attention to the boys and get them out of there.
[03:06:26.800 --> 03:06:31.500]  For the first 2 or 3 weeks of flowering, you're going to focus heavily on looking for male
[03:06:31.500 --> 03:06:37.200]  plants and plants with hermaphrodite traits and removing them from the garden safely.
[03:06:37.200 --> 03:06:41.700]  So again, I suggest that you start now doing some research on understanding what a male
[03:06:41.700 --> 03:06:46.240]  and a female and a hermaphrodite cannabis plant look like so that when you are 8, 10,
[03:06:46.240 --> 03:06:51.120]  12 or 14 days into flower, you are certain what you see and you are confident so that
[03:06:51.120 --> 03:06:54.720]  you can make the correct decision to keep your garden in top shape.
[03:06:54.720 --> 03:06:58.560]  All right, I feel like that is a great place to stop because my next lesson is going to
[03:06:58.560 --> 03:07:03.280]  be about phenohunting and sexing the plants and selecting a mother plant from that phenohunt
[03:07:03.280 --> 03:07:04.280]  process.
[03:07:04.480 --> 03:07:08.880]  Then we're going to work our way into the flowering stage of the grow lesson.
[03:07:08.880 --> 03:07:12.960]  That's right, it is almost time to flower the hypothetical plants in the grow lesson.
[03:07:12.960 --> 03:07:15.360]  So that is coming up very soon.
[03:07:15.360 --> 03:07:20.480]  I will talk in depth about probably 3 week chunks of the flowering phase.
[03:07:20.480 --> 03:07:25.760]  We'll probably do week 1 through 3 and then we'll do 4 through 6 and then we'll do 7 through
[03:07:25.760 --> 03:07:26.760]  9.
[03:07:26.760 --> 03:07:28.460]  That was hard for my brain to process that quickly.
[03:07:28.460 --> 03:07:30.640]  But that is my idea for the flowering phase.
[03:07:30.640 --> 03:07:34.440]  I'm going to break it down into 3, 3 week chunks and then we'll talk about finishing
[03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:35.480]  the plants up.
[03:07:35.480 --> 03:07:36.860]  So that is coming up very soon.
[03:07:36.860 --> 03:07:39.680]  So I feel like this is a great place to wrap up this episode.
[03:07:39.680 --> 03:07:41.360]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[03:07:41.360 --> 03:07:42.400]  Thank you for all of the support.

[03:08:38.960 --> 03:08:41.720]  I post a lot of great cannabis photography there.
[03:08:41.720 --> 03:08:43.640]  I think you would enjoy it.
[03:08:43.640 --> 03:08:46.800]  If you'd like to reach out to me and you are not into the social media, you can send me
[03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:47.800]  an email.

[03:08:52.120 --> 03:08:55.800]  Maybe I will answer your questions on a future episode.
[03:08:55.800 --> 03:08:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers, I want to thank you again for
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.880]  listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:09:01.880 --> 03:09:04.760]  I'll be back in just a few days with another fun episode.
[03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:08.320]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Ashley in New Mexico.
[03:09:08.320 --> 03:09:11.480]  Everybody better step up their game because there's a young girl grower in New Mexico
[03:09:11.480 --> 03:09:14.120]  coming to take all the cannabis cups.
[03:09:14.120 --> 03:09:18.320]  Big shout out to Ashley and until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
[03:09:18.320 --> 03:09:19.320]  me.
[03:09:19.320 --> 03:09:20.660]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[03:09:20.660 --> 03:09:24.440]  It's time for episode 376 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:09:24.440 --> 03:09:27.340]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[03:09:27.340 --> 03:09:31.840]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[03:09:31.840 --> 03:09:38.240]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:41.680]  It has become a tradition that I start the podcast off by letting you know what I am
[03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:42.680]  smoking.
[03:09:42.680 --> 03:09:46.960]  I just took a dab of some strawberry diesel batter from Apothecary Farms.
[03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:53.600]  The label says it is 61.9% THC with a total of 73.7% cannabinoids.
[03:09:53.760 --> 03:09:56.960]  This stuff has a really funky, sort of a sour strawberry smell to it.
[03:09:56.960 --> 03:10:00.840]  It's definitely got the strawberries with a hint of diesel coming through the background.
[03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:04.360]  It tasted like strawberry incense and I really liked the flavor.
[03:10:04.360 --> 03:10:06.040]  The flavor is just hanging out on my tongue.
[03:10:06.040 --> 03:10:10.080]  I could use a drink, but I don't want to drink anything to wipe that strawberry flavor off
[03:10:10.080 --> 03:10:11.080]  of my tongue.
[03:10:11.080 --> 03:10:12.720]  I want to let that linger as long as it can.
[03:10:12.720 --> 03:10:15.080]  So I'm really digging the flavor and the high is nice.
[03:10:15.080 --> 03:10:16.520]  It goes straight to the brain.
[03:10:16.520 --> 03:10:18.400]  It's a nice high energy sort of a buzz.
[03:10:18.400 --> 03:10:22.200]  I really like the strawberry diesel batter from Apothecary Farms.
[03:10:22.920 --> 03:10:24.560]  All right, let's get right into the podcast.
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:26.960]  You guys, this is going to be another grow lesson.
[03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:31.000]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.960]  This episode is going to be about pheno hunting.
[03:10:33.960 --> 03:10:37.960]  So far in my series of grow lessons, we have talked about setting a goal for our grow.
[03:10:37.960 --> 03:10:39.640]  We have chosen a wise spot for the grow.
[03:10:39.640 --> 03:10:42.120]  We have selected and purchased the proper equipment.
[03:10:42.120 --> 03:10:43.120]  We have set it up.
[03:10:43.120 --> 03:10:44.120]  We've tested it.
[03:10:44.120 --> 03:10:45.360]  We have actually sprouted seeds.
[03:10:45.360 --> 03:10:46.700]  We've acquired clones.
[03:10:46.700 --> 03:10:48.120]  We've got little baby plants going.
[03:10:48.120 --> 03:10:51.320]  We potted those into our three or five, maybe seven gallon pots.
[03:10:51.440 --> 03:10:54.120]  We are currently in the veg phase in my grow lessons.
[03:10:54.120 --> 03:10:55.240]  We have topped our plants.
[03:10:55.240 --> 03:10:56.480]  We've been doing lollipopping.
[03:10:56.480 --> 03:10:57.840]  We've been doing popping and twisting.
[03:10:57.840 --> 03:11:00.440]  We've got some canopy control techniques happening.
[03:11:00.440 --> 03:11:03.680]  We're almost ready to flower in my grow lessons.
[03:11:03.680 --> 03:11:07.960]  Before we get to the flowering phase, I feel like there are a few things we should understand.
[03:11:07.960 --> 03:11:10.240]  We need to know how to sex our plants.
[03:11:10.240 --> 03:11:13.760]  If you are growing from seed, you've got the opportunity to find males.
[03:11:13.760 --> 03:11:17.080]  Those plants won't reveal their sex until we are early in flower.
[03:11:17.080 --> 03:11:21.000]  We need to be able to identify the male plants so that we can remove them from the garden
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:23.520]  before they pollinate our females.
[03:11:23.520 --> 03:11:26.080]  Another thing we're going to talk about is selecting mother plants.
[03:11:26.080 --> 03:11:28.720]  We're going to do that through a phenohunt.
[03:11:28.720 --> 03:11:33.740]  Let's jump right in to talking about a phenohunt and what a phenohunt is and what is the purpose
[03:11:33.740 --> 03:11:35.680]  of phenohunting.
[03:11:35.680 --> 03:11:37.880]  Now what do I mean by a phenohunt?
[03:11:37.880 --> 03:11:43.760]  When I say a phenohunt, I am referring to finding a desired phenotype from a package
[03:11:43.760 --> 03:11:44.920]  of seeds.
[03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:49.240]  Now let's say you acquired a package of seeds from the Helladank Seed Company.
[03:11:49.280 --> 03:11:51.640]  I would recommend 10 seeds for a phenohunt.
[03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:53.120]  I do sell packs of five.
[03:11:53.120 --> 03:11:56.720]  I sell packs of five to make them attainable so that everybody can afford them.
[03:11:56.720 --> 03:11:59.280]  I understand not everybody can buy a 10-pack of seeds.
[03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:01.800]  I would recommend 10 seeds for a phenohunt.
[03:12:01.800 --> 03:12:04.440]  In this situation, we're going to run 10 seeds.
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:06.760]  You just got a fresh 10-pack of a rise.
[03:12:06.760 --> 03:12:07.980]  You don't know what's in there.
[03:12:07.980 --> 03:12:13.080]  We need to find that phenotype that works best for you and your garden.
[03:12:13.080 --> 03:12:15.840]  Sifting through those seeds is a phenohunt.
[03:12:15.840 --> 03:12:19.400]  You're going to grow them out and you're going to find the phenotype that works best
[03:12:19.400 --> 03:12:23.160]  for you, the phenotype that works best for your patients or your customers.
[03:12:23.160 --> 03:12:26.680]  Also, you need the phenotype that works best for your garden.
[03:12:26.680 --> 03:12:31.480]  The goal here is to find a custom tailored phenotype out of this pack of seeds.
[03:12:31.480 --> 03:12:34.000]  Let's talk about a little bit how to do that.
[03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:37.760]  Doing a phenohunt is one of my favorite things to do in a grow environment.
[03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:39.400]  I get to do a lot of observation.
[03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:40.880]  I get to find surprises.
[03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:42.520]  I may find the next best thing.
[03:12:42.520 --> 03:12:44.240]  I may find that next chem dog.
[03:12:44.240 --> 03:12:45.720]  I may find the next golden goat.
[03:12:45.800 --> 03:12:47.240]  I may find the next gorilla glue.
[03:12:47.240 --> 03:12:49.880]  I may find the next Girl Scout cookies.
[03:12:49.880 --> 03:12:52.600]  You never know what you could come up with in a phenohunt.
[03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:54.320]  That is one of my favorite parts.
[03:12:54.320 --> 03:12:55.720]  It's like opening Christmas presents.
[03:12:55.720 --> 03:12:58.040]  You never know what is in that box.
[03:12:58.040 --> 03:13:02.160]  Suddenly, I want to make a Forrest Gump reference because you never know what you're going to
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:03.160]  get.
[03:13:03.160 --> 03:13:04.760]  So this is how I would do a phenohunt.
[03:13:04.760 --> 03:13:06.840]  I would get a 10-pack of seeds.
[03:13:06.840 --> 03:13:09.040]  I would germinate those 10 seeds.
[03:13:09.040 --> 03:13:14.280]  I would carefully make sure that every one of those plants is treated the exact same.
[03:13:14.280 --> 03:13:17.080]  I would put them all in the same medium, the same pot.
[03:13:17.080 --> 03:13:18.440]  I would feed them the same thing.
[03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:22.160]  They would go under the same light, and they would be all in the same environment because
[03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:24.400]  I don't want any variation.
[03:13:24.400 --> 03:13:29.160]  I want all of these seedlings to get the same opportunity to show me the same potential.
[03:13:29.160 --> 03:13:30.760]  So I germinate these seeds.
[03:13:30.760 --> 03:13:31.880]  I get them into pots.
[03:13:31.880 --> 03:13:33.040]  I get them going.
[03:13:33.040 --> 03:13:34.160]  I veg them.
[03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:36.880]  I start taking notes on these plants very early.
[03:13:36.880 --> 03:13:38.860]  I label them 1 through 10.
[03:13:38.860 --> 03:13:40.200]  So I've got whatever the strain is.
[03:13:40.200 --> 03:13:43.880]  We're going to say a rise 1, a rise 2, all the way up to number 10.
[03:13:44.480 --> 03:13:47.360]  I'm going to pay attention to these plants and take a lot of notes.
[03:13:47.360 --> 03:13:50.320]  If I see anything weird, I'm going to document that.
[03:13:50.320 --> 03:13:54.280]  If I get a plant that's just growing like shit, it's not keeping up, it's having problems,
[03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:55.400]  it gets pulled out of there.
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:13:58.120]  I don't want to keep a shitty plant around.
[03:13:58.120 --> 03:14:02.480]  There's no reason to have a shitty plant when you can phenohunt seeds and find a keeper.
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:04.600]  So I'll pay close attention to my plants as they grow.
[03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:06.760]  I'll take a lot of notes and veg.
[03:14:06.760 --> 03:14:11.880]  If I top the plants, if I lollipop the plants, I make sure to do it equally across the board.
[03:14:11.880 --> 03:14:14.880]  I want all 10 of these seedlings to get the same treatment.
[03:14:14.880 --> 03:14:17.640]  Again, we want them all to have the same potential.
[03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:21.920]  We're trying to audition these to find the best one for our situation.
[03:14:21.920 --> 03:14:24.960]  So if you give them different treatment, they're going to come out differently.
[03:14:24.960 --> 03:14:26.760]  How do you know what the best one is?
[03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:29.960]  They all need to be treated equally, in my opinion.
[03:14:29.960 --> 03:14:31.840]  So I grow these plants out.
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:34.160]  As soon as they're big enough, I take a clone.
[03:14:34.160 --> 03:14:36.520]  I am confident in my cloning skills.
[03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:39.640]  99.9% of my clones will survive.
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:44.280]  If you are not confident in your clone skills, I suggest you take two, maybe three, maybe
[03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:46.440]  five clones from each plant.
[03:14:46.440 --> 03:14:49.960]  So let them get large enough to provide the amount of clones you need.
[03:14:49.960 --> 03:14:52.040]  Get a clone from each plant.
[03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:53.280]  Carefully label your clones.
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:56.200]  You will have a rise number one, a rise number two.
[03:14:56.200 --> 03:15:00.880]  You should have clone, a rise one, clone, a rise two.
[03:15:00.880 --> 03:15:01.880]  Carefully label them.
[03:15:01.880 --> 03:15:03.680]  This will be very important in the future.
[03:15:03.680 --> 03:15:05.380]  This is your reserve.
[03:15:05.380 --> 03:15:08.080]  This is how you are going to keep your plants around.
[03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:10.560]  This is going to segue into selecting a mother plant.
[03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:14.200]  This is how we're going to have a mother plant to keep these genetics around forever so you
[03:15:14.200 --> 03:15:18.800]  can continue to produce this select phenotype until the end of time.
[03:15:18.800 --> 03:15:22.240]  That clone that we labeled is going to become your future mother plant.
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:24.480]  So make sure it is labeled accurately.
[03:15:24.480 --> 03:15:28.880]  So again, we label them a rise one, a rise two, all the way up to a rise number 10.
[03:15:28.880 --> 03:15:33.180]  Then we also label the clones, A1, A2, A all the way up to number 10.
[03:15:33.180 --> 03:15:36.520]  So we've got the clone donor and the corresponding clones properly labeled.
[03:15:36.520 --> 03:15:38.060]  There's no confusion there.
[03:15:38.060 --> 03:15:40.760]  You guys have done a complete episode on cutting clones.
[03:15:40.760 --> 03:15:45.900]  So if you need help cutting your clones, I recommend episode number 346 for an in-depth
[03:15:45.900 --> 03:15:47.780]  lesson on cutting clones.
[03:15:47.780 --> 03:15:52.340]  And if you want a really in-depth talk about mother plants, check out episode 315.
[03:15:52.340 --> 03:15:55.940]  That one will teach you all about healthy and happy mother plants.
[03:15:55.940 --> 03:16:00.540]  The goal here is to get a clone off of each of these seedlings before we put them into
[03:16:00.540 --> 03:16:01.540]  flower.
[03:16:01.540 --> 03:16:06.060]  That way, when we find the champion out of this batch, we've got a clone of that so that
[03:16:06.060 --> 03:16:08.820]  we can continue to grow that clone forever.
[03:16:08.820 --> 03:16:10.980]  You keep that one clone alive as a mother plant.
[03:16:10.980 --> 03:16:15.220]  You never flower it out and you can cut clones from that as long as you keep it healthy.
[03:16:15.220 --> 03:16:17.060]  So it's always there to give you clones.
[03:16:17.060 --> 03:16:20.220]  You have now got a mother plant from your pheno hunt.
[03:16:20.220 --> 03:16:24.160]  That is your custom phenotype that is for you.
[03:16:24.160 --> 03:16:26.820]  Maybe you like the more sativa dominant phenotype.
[03:16:26.820 --> 03:16:29.840]  Maybe you like the phenotype that smells more like golden goat.
[03:16:29.840 --> 03:16:32.800]  Maybe you like the phenotype that smells more like dirty feet.
[03:16:32.800 --> 03:16:34.660]  Maybe you need the one that finishes quicker.
[03:16:35.060 --> 03:16:38.740]  You're the kind of person that likes to let them flower for a really long time.
[03:16:38.740 --> 03:16:39.740]  That's up to you.
[03:16:39.740 --> 03:16:43.660]  You get to find that one that works best for you in your grow.
[03:16:43.660 --> 03:16:47.620]  If you get a clone, you've got a clone that all of your other friends have.
[03:16:47.620 --> 03:16:48.620]  Everybody's grown it.
[03:16:48.620 --> 03:16:49.980]  Everybody in the neighborhood has it.
[03:16:49.980 --> 03:16:50.980]  Everybody has smoked it.
[03:16:50.980 --> 03:16:55.220]  There's nothing setting you apart from the competition if you were growing for a retail
[03:16:55.220 --> 03:16:56.460]  market purpose.
[03:16:56.460 --> 03:16:59.260]  So growing from seed, you could find gold.
[03:16:59.260 --> 03:17:03.220]  Growing from seed, you can also find that custom phenotype that works for you, that
[03:17:03.220 --> 03:17:06.380]  works for your garden, and that works for the market.
[03:17:06.380 --> 03:17:10.100]  And honestly, when you're growing from seed, I always recommend taking a clone because
[03:17:10.100 --> 03:17:11.720]  who knows what you've got.
[03:17:11.720 --> 03:17:15.940]  What if you grow from seed and you find the most amazing product you've ever found and
[03:17:15.940 --> 03:17:17.060]  you don't have a clone?
[03:17:17.060 --> 03:17:18.060]  You're going to be heartbroken.
[03:17:18.060 --> 03:17:21.140]  You're going to try to revege it, which is a whole another podcast.
[03:17:21.140 --> 03:17:22.540]  That's a pain in the ass.
[03:17:22.540 --> 03:17:25.660]  But if you have got a clone, it's already ready to go.
[03:17:25.660 --> 03:17:30.220]  If you cut a clone before you put your plants into flower, that clone is going to go into
[03:17:30.220 --> 03:17:32.420]  a pot about two weeks later.
[03:17:32.420 --> 03:17:35.540]  And it'll be ready to go into another pot a couple of weeks later.
[03:17:35.540 --> 03:17:40.140]  You can cut a bunch more clones off of that and have that ready to go by the time that
[03:17:40.140 --> 03:17:41.860]  first crop is finished.
[03:17:41.860 --> 03:17:45.820]  So you will have decided which one is the keeper probably around week seven or eight,
[03:17:45.820 --> 03:17:50.500]  and you can take a bunch of clones and have them ready almost on time to fill that room
[03:17:50.500 --> 03:17:52.100]  when you cut down from the pheno hunt.
[03:17:52.100 --> 03:17:53.980]  And you don't have to skip any time.
[03:17:53.980 --> 03:17:56.180]  It helps you move along quite quickly.
[03:17:56.180 --> 03:17:58.860]  So now our original plants have grown out nice and large.
[03:17:58.860 --> 03:18:00.580]  We have got clones from everything.
[03:18:00.580 --> 03:18:01.980]  They are properly labeled.
[03:18:01.980 --> 03:18:07.100]  We are confident that at least one of those clones from each phenotype is going to root.
[03:18:07.100 --> 03:18:10.100]  Then it is time to flower my pheno hunt.
[03:18:10.100 --> 03:18:12.100]  That's when the fun begins.
[03:18:12.100 --> 03:18:15.180]  We can tell a lot about our plants during the veg cycle.
[03:18:15.180 --> 03:18:19.100]  We can tell if you like the growth structure, if you like the node spacing, if you like
[03:18:19.100 --> 03:18:20.220]  the leaf size.
[03:18:20.220 --> 03:18:22.340]  That's going to indicate a lot of things.
[03:18:22.340 --> 03:18:26.580]  The real things we want to see will not reveal themselves until they are in flower.
[03:18:26.580 --> 03:18:31.500]  So early in flower, the first things we need to pay attention to, we need to look for males.
[03:18:31.500 --> 03:18:35.540]  If you are growing from seed, you have got the opportunity to have males pop up in your
[03:18:35.540 --> 03:18:39.460]  garden, even if you are running feminized seeds.
[03:18:39.460 --> 03:18:43.120]  Not all feminized seed makers make seeds the same way.
[03:18:43.120 --> 03:18:46.420]  Some feminized seeds were made with poor practices.
[03:18:46.420 --> 03:18:50.920]  Some feminized seeds were made without auditioning the parrot plants properly before breeding
[03:18:50.920 --> 03:18:51.920]  with them.
[03:18:51.920 --> 03:18:57.620]  You still may find males or intersex traits in feminized seeds.
[03:18:57.620 --> 03:19:01.660]  Just because the package says feminized, doesn't mean you can get lazy and stop paying
[03:19:01.660 --> 03:19:02.660]  attention.
[03:19:02.660 --> 03:19:08.420]  So, we need to look for males or hermaphrodites in our garden early in flower.
[03:19:08.420 --> 03:19:11.700]  I would start looking day three, day four, day five.
[03:19:11.700 --> 03:19:14.900]  You're going to start seeing signs of male pre-flower.
[03:19:14.900 --> 03:19:19.460]  As soon as you are certain that that plant is a male, it needs to come out of the garden.
[03:19:19.460 --> 03:19:21.420]  We do not want boys in there.
[03:19:21.420 --> 03:19:23.660]  The girls are going to start developing pistils.
[03:19:23.660 --> 03:19:25.180]  They'll be able to receive pollen.
[03:19:25.180 --> 03:19:27.720]  When those males drop pollen, they're going to seed your plant.
[03:19:27.720 --> 03:19:31.220]  We need to get the boys out as soon as possible.
[03:19:31.220 --> 03:19:35.120]  I do plan to talk more in depth about sexing our plants in a future episode when we get
[03:19:35.120 --> 03:19:40.000]  into the flowering phase, but quickly, let's talk about identifying a male and a female
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:42.540]  cannabis plant early in flower.
[03:19:42.540 --> 03:19:46.300]  When I am trying to identify the sex of a cannabis plant, there are two spots I like
[03:19:46.300 --> 03:19:49.420]  to look and I find those spots very reliable.
[03:19:49.420 --> 03:19:54.320]  The very tip top bud will be the first spot to show you sex when you throw those plants
[03:19:54.360 --> 03:19:55.360]  into flower.
[03:19:55.360 --> 03:19:59.880]  Also, lower on the plant where you've got an intersection, you've got the little peace
[03:19:59.880 --> 03:20:00.880]  sign.
[03:20:00.880 --> 03:20:03.680]  You've got two branches coming off and you've got the main stalk coming up right there at
[03:20:03.680 --> 03:20:04.880]  that intersection.
[03:20:04.880 --> 03:20:07.560]  It loves to tell you if it is a boy or a girl.
[03:20:07.560 --> 03:20:12.720]  A few days into flower, our plants will start giving us signs of male or female sex.
[03:20:12.720 --> 03:20:16.440]  If you grab a branch and look closely, there will be the main branch coming up.
[03:20:16.440 --> 03:20:19.360]  Then there will be a little shoot coming off of that.
[03:20:19.360 --> 03:20:24.440]  Where that shoot splits off, there will be signs of sex right at that intersection.
[03:20:24.440 --> 03:20:27.640]  Right inside of that little V, there will be signs of sex.
[03:20:27.640 --> 03:20:32.440]  If you see a wart-like thing popping up right there, if you see a little tiny acorn popping
[03:20:32.440 --> 03:20:37.680]  up right there, if it's got a ball coming out of there, that is probably a male plant.
[03:20:37.680 --> 03:20:42.180]  If it looks like it's got a hair coming out, just one little pistol, maybe two little pistol
[03:20:42.180 --> 03:20:45.640]  hairs doing a peace sign, that is a female.
[03:20:45.640 --> 03:20:50.320]  At the intersections, at the nodes, you will see either little hairs coming out or you
[03:20:50.320 --> 03:20:52.120]  may see what looks like balls.
[03:20:52.120 --> 03:20:56.680]  Now, be careful in early flower because sometimes those little balls are actually calyxes and
[03:20:56.680 --> 03:20:58.480]  it can be confusing.
[03:20:58.480 --> 03:21:03.440]  If you have identified something that you think may be a male flower, mark that plant.
[03:21:03.440 --> 03:21:08.360]  Say, arise number seven, looks like it could be a boy, write that down somewhere.
[03:21:08.360 --> 03:21:12.160]  Then every day when you go in that garden, head right over to number seven and look at
[03:21:12.160 --> 03:21:13.800]  the progress.
[03:21:13.960 --> 03:21:18.080]  If those balls that are on the plant start drooping and hanging down, that is definitely
[03:21:18.080 --> 03:21:19.080]  a male.
[03:21:19.080 --> 03:21:20.120]  It's growing a set of balls.
[03:21:20.120 --> 03:21:22.040]  You need to get that boy out of there.
[03:21:22.040 --> 03:21:28.200]  If that ball starts putting out a long hair, that is a calyx and you've got a female plant.
[03:21:28.200 --> 03:21:31.460]  Up toward the top of the plant, we should see a little bit of production.
[03:21:31.460 --> 03:21:34.440]  You will either see buds that look like dandelions.
[03:21:34.440 --> 03:21:35.440]  Those are your girls.
[03:21:35.440 --> 03:21:39.440]  If they're getting hairs, the white furry pistols are popping out, those are females.
[03:21:39.440 --> 03:21:40.520]  That's what you want.
[03:21:40.520 --> 03:21:44.920]  If it looks like you're making little sets of bananas up at the top, those are your boy
[03:21:44.920 --> 03:21:45.920]  plants.
[03:21:45.920 --> 03:21:46.920]  We need to get rid of those.
[03:21:46.920 --> 03:21:50.680]  It may look like you've got a little bud that is already loaded up with seeds.
[03:21:50.680 --> 03:21:52.040]  Those are not seeds.
[03:21:52.040 --> 03:21:53.640]  Those are pollen sacks.
[03:21:53.640 --> 03:21:57.160]  We need to get that boy out of the room immediately.
[03:21:57.160 --> 03:22:02.120]  I can only describe males and females so much through words with a podcast.
[03:22:02.120 --> 03:22:07.320]  It is your responsibility as a ganja farmer to Google what a male and female cannabis
[03:22:07.320 --> 03:22:08.320]  plant look like.
[03:22:08.320 --> 03:22:09.720]  You need some images.
[03:22:09.920 --> 03:22:10.920]  Get ahead of yourself.
[03:22:10.920 --> 03:22:14.020]  Go look before you put your plants into flower.
[03:22:14.020 --> 03:22:18.360]  Do not make the mistake of thinking, I can identify a male plant and then let that male
[03:22:18.360 --> 03:22:19.560]  go.
[03:22:19.560 --> 03:22:24.760]  By day 10, day 14, he's going to be dropping pollen and you're going to have a pollinated
[03:22:24.760 --> 03:22:25.760]  crop.
[03:22:25.760 --> 03:22:27.920]  If you're a new grower, that is very discouraging.
[03:22:27.920 --> 03:22:29.080]  Everything just went to shit.
[03:22:29.080 --> 03:22:31.680]  Your main goal is to produce a crop with no seeds.
[03:22:31.680 --> 03:22:33.160]  You just reduced potency.
[03:22:33.160 --> 03:22:34.720]  You just reduced harvest weight.
[03:22:34.720 --> 03:22:37.160]  You definitely reduced retail value.
[03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:40.000]  Gardening is not how you want it if you've got seeds in there.
[03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:44.800]  Be very careful to get the boys out very, very early.
[03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:49.280]  If you were observing your plants and your plants show ball sacks and they show hairs,
[03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:51.120]  they need to go immediately.
[03:22:51.120 --> 03:22:52.720]  Those are hermaphrodite plants.
[03:22:52.720 --> 03:22:55.600]  I know it's 2018 and we're supposed to be acceptable.
[03:22:55.600 --> 03:22:59.080]  I do not accept hermaphroditic plants in my garden for any reason.
[03:22:59.080 --> 03:23:00.320]  They must go.
[03:23:00.320 --> 03:23:04.560]  We're trying to produce high-grade seedless cannabis and a hermaphrodite plant is going
[03:23:04.560 --> 03:23:07.520]  to ruin our whole goal of a seedless garden.
[03:23:07.520 --> 03:23:10.040]  Get rid of the males and get rid of the hermaphrodites.
[03:23:10.040 --> 03:23:14.200]  If you are not sure if that plant is a male or a hermaphrodite, pay very close attention
[03:23:14.200 --> 03:23:15.200]  to it.
[03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:17.820]  Keep an eye on that part you think may be a male part.
[03:23:17.820 --> 03:23:19.080]  It will start to open up.
[03:23:19.080 --> 03:23:20.360]  It will start to hang.
[03:23:20.360 --> 03:23:23.520]  It will give you plenty of warning that it wants to release pollen.
[03:23:23.520 --> 03:23:25.280]  Pay close attention.
[03:23:25.280 --> 03:23:28.600]  Once you've culled your boys and you think you are past the part of the plants revealing
[03:23:28.600 --> 03:23:33.880]  sex, if you were growing from seed, you still need to pay attention for hermaphrodites.
[03:23:33.880 --> 03:23:39.640]  It is not uncommon for things to reveal intersex traits late in flower, sometime around week
[03:23:39.640 --> 03:23:42.800]  seven or week eight or especially week nine.
[03:23:42.800 --> 03:23:46.500]  And if you push them real hard, it's way likely to see them toward week 10.
[03:23:46.500 --> 03:23:50.960]  So pay attention to the hermaphrodite traits in your plants.
[03:23:50.960 --> 03:23:55.560]  If a plant shows herm late in flower, you've got some considerations to make.
[03:23:55.560 --> 03:23:58.940]  If it didn't pop up until week nine, that may be okay.
[03:23:58.940 --> 03:24:03.360]  If that weed is fire, if you just produced some amazing product and that plant herms
[03:24:03.360 --> 03:24:06.000]  late in the bloom cycle, that may be okay.
[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:09.760]  We're going to cut the plants down before that hermaphrodite is able to cause us any
[03:24:09.760 --> 03:24:10.760]  problems.
[03:24:10.760 --> 03:24:16.640]  Also, a lot of the hermaphrodite plants that show intersex traits late in flower produce
[03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:17.920]  sterile male flowers.
[03:24:17.920 --> 03:24:20.440]  They won't even produce pollen that can pollinate a room.
[03:24:20.440 --> 03:24:23.160]  It'll pop out a couple of nanners and they'll dry up immediately.
[03:24:23.160 --> 03:24:24.980]  They won't ever produce pollen.
[03:24:24.980 --> 03:24:25.980]  So that is up to you.
[03:24:25.980 --> 03:24:29.560]  If you get a plant that does hermaphrodite late in flower, if it's not going to cause
[03:24:29.560 --> 03:24:33.800]  problems and it produces amazing product, it may be worth keeping around.
[03:24:33.800 --> 03:24:35.480]  That is something for you to consider.
[03:24:35.480 --> 03:24:40.240]  Also, if you ever share that clone with people, maybe let them know, hey bro, at the end of
[03:24:40.240 --> 03:24:43.580]  week nine, this one might throw a couple of nanners on you.
[03:24:43.580 --> 03:24:46.420]  As an experienced grower, that's something I'm familiar with.
[03:24:46.420 --> 03:24:47.880]  That's something I'm comfortable with.
[03:24:47.880 --> 03:24:49.840]  That's something I can deal with.
[03:24:49.840 --> 03:24:55.040]  Very many of the chem dog derived strains will herm on you if you let them go past nine
[03:24:55.040 --> 03:24:56.040]  weeks.
[03:24:56.040 --> 03:24:57.040]  That is not rare.
[03:24:57.040 --> 03:25:01.040]  If it doesn't go too long, it'll throw out a couple of nanners, but those nanners don't
[03:25:01.040 --> 03:25:02.120]  contain any pollen.
[03:25:02.120 --> 03:25:03.360]  They will not pollinate anything.
[03:25:03.360 --> 03:25:06.160]  They'll just pop up a couple of male bananas right at the end.
[03:25:06.160 --> 03:25:09.280]  So the way to solve that, either cut it down right before that happens, because I know
[03:25:09.280 --> 03:25:11.840]  when it happens, it happens at day 70.
[03:25:11.840 --> 03:25:13.560]  So cut them down about day 68.
[03:25:13.560 --> 03:25:14.800]  Everything should be cool.
[03:25:14.800 --> 03:25:19.120]  And I've also grown that plant enough to know that those male flowers don't produce any
[03:25:19.120 --> 03:25:20.120]  pollen.
[03:25:20.120 --> 03:25:23.380]  So even if I do let it finish, if I let it go 70, 72 days, it's still not going to cause
[03:25:23.380 --> 03:25:24.380]  a problem.
[03:25:24.380 --> 03:25:27.540]  So even if they did spit out pollen, I'm 72 days in the flower.
[03:25:27.540 --> 03:25:28.820]  There's no time for anything to happen.
[03:25:28.820 --> 03:25:31.220]  All of my pistols have been shriveled up by then.
[03:25:31.220 --> 03:25:32.980]  There's nowhere for that pollen to be received.
[03:25:32.980 --> 03:25:37.540]  So you have things to consider if your plants are hermaphroditing late in flower.
[03:25:37.540 --> 03:25:40.180]  If it's early in flower, cull them, get rid of them.
[03:25:40.180 --> 03:25:42.500]  If it's an obvious hermaphrodite, toss it.
[03:25:42.500 --> 03:25:45.860]  If you've just got one flower late in, I would think about it.
[03:25:45.860 --> 03:25:49.780]  Now if you've got one hermaphrodite flower late in, and that plant is only a six on a
[03:25:49.780 --> 03:25:51.800]  scale of 10, you still cull it.
[03:25:51.800 --> 03:25:55.440]  If you've got a nine or a 10 and a hermaphrodite flower, that's when you kind of consider,
[03:25:55.440 --> 03:25:57.580]  you're like, is it worth that one herm or not?
[03:25:57.580 --> 03:25:59.860]  But that is a grower's decision to make.
[03:25:59.860 --> 03:26:02.040]  So that is a quick rant on sexing your plants.
[03:26:02.040 --> 03:26:05.240]  I do plan on going into more depth on that in a future episode.
[03:26:05.240 --> 03:26:08.280]  You were looking for the little hairs or the balls.
[03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:10.120]  If it's got balls, it's got to go.
[03:26:10.120 --> 03:26:13.800]  If it's got hairs and balls, it definitely has to go.
[03:26:13.800 --> 03:26:18.400]  Now once we cull the males and the potential hermaphrodites, you have probably got 40 to
[03:26:18.400 --> 03:26:20.960]  60% of your remaining stock.
[03:26:21.120 --> 03:26:24.240]  These plants average about 50% male and 50% female.
[03:26:24.240 --> 03:26:29.000]  So by day 14, you have probably eliminated 40 to 60% of the room.
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:32.420]  If you started with 10 seeds, you were probably down to about five.
[03:26:32.420 --> 03:26:34.120]  You may have six, you may have four.
[03:26:34.120 --> 03:26:37.300]  I'm going to go with five for the rest of this lesson.
[03:26:37.300 --> 03:26:38.440]  So we've got five plants.
[03:26:38.440 --> 03:26:39.440]  They're in their finishing pots.
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:41.240]  They're about two weeks into flower.
[03:26:41.240 --> 03:26:42.320]  We've pulled out all the males.
[03:26:42.320 --> 03:26:43.680]  We've pulled out all the hermaphrodites.
[03:26:43.680 --> 03:26:46.640]  We are still paying attention for intersex traits.
[03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:49.680]  We're also keeping a lot of notes.
[03:26:49.680 --> 03:26:51.520]  Write down everything you feed these plants.
[03:26:51.520 --> 03:26:53.840]  Write down everything you spray on these plants.
[03:26:53.840 --> 03:26:57.320]  Write down the reactions of the plants to those procedures.
[03:26:57.320 --> 03:27:01.380]  If you see one plant do something different than all of the others as a reaction to something
[03:27:01.380 --> 03:27:03.440]  you did, document that.
[03:27:03.440 --> 03:27:05.680]  That may mean a lot to you in the future.
[03:27:05.680 --> 03:27:10.080]  Let's say that plant one and plant five become the two best keepers out of this phenol hunt
[03:27:10.080 --> 03:27:12.280]  and you need to narrow it down to one.
[03:27:12.280 --> 03:27:16.500]  Maybe that weird note you wrote about plant number one will be the reason you cull that
[03:27:16.500 --> 03:27:18.600]  one and the reason you keep number five.
[03:27:18.600 --> 03:27:20.800]  So keep a lot of notes.
[03:27:20.800 --> 03:27:24.560]  So I do plan to do in-depth lessons on each week of the bloom cycle.
[03:27:24.560 --> 03:27:26.560]  I'm going to break it down into trimesters.
[03:27:26.560 --> 03:27:30.720]  We'll do weeks one through three, four through six, and seven through nine.
[03:27:30.720 --> 03:27:32.400]  We'll talk about that in depth.
[03:27:32.400 --> 03:27:36.960]  We're going to fast forward a little bit through the grow cycle here in the phenotype talk,
[03:27:36.960 --> 03:27:39.560]  and we're going to get toward the end of the harvest.
[03:27:39.560 --> 03:27:43.600]  During the grow phase, during the bloom phase, our plants got the same exact treatment.
[03:27:43.600 --> 03:27:44.720]  We've only got five of them.
[03:27:44.720 --> 03:27:47.360]  It should have been fairly easy to treat them all the same.
[03:27:47.360 --> 03:27:48.880]  They got the same amount of light.
[03:27:48.880 --> 03:27:52.480]  They got the same amount of lollipopping, the same type of pruning, the same type of
[03:27:52.480 --> 03:27:57.200]  topping, the exact same feedings, the exact same pest management, the exact same foliar
[03:27:57.200 --> 03:27:58.200]  feedings.
[03:27:58.200 --> 03:27:59.200]  You get my point.
[03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:03.840]  We treated them all the same so that we can see reliable outcomes from each seedling.
[03:28:03.840 --> 03:28:09.400]  Now just like any crop, make sure you flush for 10 to 14 days before harvest.
[03:28:09.400 --> 03:28:10.520]  Then harvest.
[03:28:10.520 --> 03:28:16.000]  I have done a long and in-depth episode on harvesting and drying and curing our plants.
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:20.040]  If you need tips on drying and curing your freshly harvested cannabis plants, I recommend
[03:28:20.040 --> 03:28:24.440]  you listen to episode 326 titled Drying and Curing.
[03:28:24.440 --> 03:28:30.000]  I will give you a detailed step-by-step lesson on drying and curing your freshly harvested
[03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:31.000]  cannabis.
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:32.000]  You've got to grow it.
[03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:33.000]  You've got to flower it.
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:34.000]  Then you've got to flush it.
[03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:35.000]  Then harvest it.
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:36.720]  Then dry it and cure it and trim it.
[03:28:36.720 --> 03:28:38.440]  Guess what you get to do next?
[03:28:38.440 --> 03:28:40.960]  You get to have a smoke party.
[03:28:40.960 --> 03:28:43.680]  Depending on how much you grew, depending on how many people you trust and how many
[03:28:43.680 --> 03:28:49.400]  friends you've got, you get to have a few people come over and test your phenohunt.
[03:28:49.400 --> 03:28:52.960]  This is one of the most fun and rewarding parts of growing cannabis.
[03:28:52.960 --> 03:28:58.040]  You started with 10 seeds about 120 days ago, and now you've got a small group of close
[03:28:58.040 --> 03:29:02.600]  friends at your house helping you narrow it down to decide what plant is going to be part
[03:29:02.600 --> 03:29:04.480]  of your future grow.
[03:29:04.480 --> 03:29:08.400]  Now when you and your friends are narrowing down which phenotype to select, you get to
[03:29:08.400 --> 03:29:09.720]  make the final decision.
[03:29:09.720 --> 03:29:13.440]  Don't let anybody sway you on the final decision because you are the grower.
[03:29:14.200 --> 03:29:15.200]  You are the one doing the work.
[03:29:15.200 --> 03:29:16.320]  This is your art.
[03:29:16.320 --> 03:29:18.160]  You get to decide.
[03:29:18.160 --> 03:29:22.320]  What I like to do is after everything is dried and cured and we're ready to smoke it, I get
[03:29:22.320 --> 03:29:23.320]  Mike over.
[03:29:23.320 --> 03:29:24.320]  I get Kevin over.
[03:29:24.320 --> 03:29:27.720]  I bring a couple other folks over, and I give them five little buds.
[03:29:27.720 --> 03:29:30.160]  If we've got time to do it, we'll smoke them all right here.
[03:29:30.160 --> 03:29:33.400]  We'll just take a couple bong rips of each or whatever and see what it all tastes like,
[03:29:33.400 --> 03:29:36.720]  see what it smells like, and look for what you're looking for.
[03:29:36.720 --> 03:29:37.880]  Are you looking for flavor?
[03:29:37.880 --> 03:29:39.640]  Are you looking for a specific aroma?
[03:29:39.640 --> 03:29:41.800]  Are you looking for a specific effect?
[03:29:41.800 --> 03:29:43.200]  Are you looking for bag appeal?
[03:29:44.160 --> 03:29:48.400]  Like I said earlier, if you are a retail market grower, you're probably going for some bag
[03:29:48.400 --> 03:29:49.400]  appeal.
[03:29:49.400 --> 03:29:51.320]  You're going to need the buds that look the best.
[03:29:51.320 --> 03:29:53.800]  Also, you may want something that is unique.
[03:29:53.800 --> 03:29:58.240]  If you've got something that smells like oranges or strawberries or blueberries, we've all
[03:29:58.240 --> 03:29:59.240]  got that.
[03:29:59.240 --> 03:30:03.600]  If you've got something that smells like oranges and gas and cherries and dirty feet and gets
[03:30:03.600 --> 03:30:08.240]  you high as fuck and finishes in 60 days, you just found gold, that is probably the
[03:30:08.240 --> 03:30:10.240]  one you want to keep.
[03:30:10.240 --> 03:30:11.840]  Find the one that works best for you.
[03:30:11.840 --> 03:30:15.120]  Let your friends do a little tasting and let them vote on it.
[03:30:15.120 --> 03:30:17.240]  They may agree, they may not.
[03:30:17.240 --> 03:30:18.760]  Decide what works best for you.
[03:30:18.760 --> 03:30:22.680]  It's just great to have input from your friends and it's always a good time to have a little
[03:30:22.680 --> 03:30:25.600]  pheno hunt party with the crew.
[03:30:25.600 --> 03:30:27.800]  Here's a quick breakdown of a pheno hunt.
[03:30:27.800 --> 03:30:32.680]  The main point is to find the outlier in a population of seeds.
[03:30:32.680 --> 03:30:36.000]  We do so by germinating a batch of seeds.
[03:30:36.000 --> 03:30:40.480]  In that process, we remove the problematic plants, which may be males, hermaphrodites,
[03:30:40.480 --> 03:30:41.480]  or mutants.
[03:30:42.120 --> 03:30:44.280]  Then we take clones before we flower our plants.
[03:30:44.280 --> 03:30:47.040]  We carefully label those plants to match the clones.
[03:30:47.040 --> 03:30:50.280]  We've got plant one and clone one, plant two and clone two.
[03:30:50.280 --> 03:30:52.400]  That way, when we're done, we've got mother plants.
[03:30:52.400 --> 03:30:55.360]  We're going to talk about that a little more in just a second.
[03:30:55.360 --> 03:30:58.400]  We've popped seeds, we've removed the problems, we've got clones.
[03:30:58.400 --> 03:31:00.480]  Now we flower out our plants.
[03:31:00.480 --> 03:31:04.600]  In that process, take a lot of notes so you know what you did.
[03:31:04.600 --> 03:31:06.520]  We are cannabis consumers.
[03:31:06.520 --> 03:31:08.200]  We may have fuzzy memories.
[03:31:08.200 --> 03:31:10.840]  I like to smoke before I work in the garden.
[03:31:10.880 --> 03:31:12.720]  Sometimes I may forget some details.
[03:31:12.720 --> 03:31:15.160]  That's why I write down everything.
[03:31:15.160 --> 03:31:17.240]  That notepad isn't going to forget anything.
[03:31:17.240 --> 03:31:19.560]  That Google document won't forget anything.
[03:31:19.560 --> 03:31:22.720]  My high ass will probably forget a couple of details.
[03:31:22.720 --> 03:31:24.400]  Write your shit down.
[03:31:24.400 --> 03:31:25.720]  So finish the crop.
[03:31:25.720 --> 03:31:27.080]  Get it all the way to the end.
[03:31:27.080 --> 03:31:28.080]  Flush it.
[03:31:28.080 --> 03:31:29.080]  Harvest.
[03:31:29.080 --> 03:31:30.080]  Dry and cure.
[03:31:30.080 --> 03:31:31.400]  Do a little smoke test with your friends.
[03:31:31.400 --> 03:31:33.600]  Decide which one you like the best.
[03:31:33.600 --> 03:31:34.760]  What works for your garden?
[03:31:34.760 --> 03:31:35.760]  What works for you?
[03:31:35.760 --> 03:31:37.200]  What works for your clientele?
[03:31:37.200 --> 03:31:38.960]  Are you growing for a medical patient?
[03:31:38.960 --> 03:31:40.880]  What works best for them?
[03:31:40.880 --> 03:31:45.480]  When I get the opportunity, I like to send my finished products to a lab for testing.
[03:31:45.480 --> 03:31:49.960]  You would be surprised at how many plants we select as the keeper that are not the highest
[03:31:49.960 --> 03:31:51.720]  tester in the batch.
[03:31:51.720 --> 03:31:54.800]  Sometimes the highest tester isn't the one with the best flavor.
[03:31:54.800 --> 03:31:59.360]  Sometimes the one with the highest test does not bring the best high when you smoke it.
[03:31:59.360 --> 03:32:03.920]  Sometimes those lab results are impressive, but we did not choose the one that gave us
[03:32:03.920 --> 03:32:07.360]  the best results based on our smoke test.
[03:32:07.360 --> 03:32:10.760]  Sometimes we did choose the one that matches up with the test, but not always.
[03:32:10.760 --> 03:32:15.520]  And it's more common that we don't agree with the lab test is which one is our keeper.
[03:32:15.520 --> 03:32:18.760]  Another thing you're going to find when you do a pheno hunt, you will find two that you
[03:32:18.760 --> 03:32:20.280]  really, really want to keep.
[03:32:20.280 --> 03:32:24.560]  There'll be one that smells real well and smokes real well and gets you super high.
[03:32:24.560 --> 03:32:28.320]  And there'll be one that does all of that pretty well, but it harvests way better.
[03:32:28.320 --> 03:32:30.240]  Being a grower, that's always hard to decide.
[03:32:30.240 --> 03:32:32.200]  I always keep the one that smokes better.
[03:32:32.200 --> 03:32:33.980]  We can just grow more next month.
[03:32:33.980 --> 03:32:35.640]  Try not to select because it's pretty.
[03:32:35.640 --> 03:32:37.920]  Try not to select because it harvests the most.
[03:32:37.920 --> 03:32:45.360]  Try to select based on effect, based on potency, based on desirability, based on marketability.
[03:32:45.360 --> 03:32:49.060]  There's enough bullshit out there that looks really good on Instagram and doesn't smoke
[03:32:49.060 --> 03:32:50.060]  worth a shit.
[03:32:50.060 --> 03:32:54.920]  So even if your plants aren't super photogenic, if they do what you need when you smoke them,
[03:32:54.920 --> 03:32:58.400]  when you and your market consume them, that's exactly what you're aiming for.
[03:32:58.400 --> 03:33:00.540]  So that is the phenotype you want to find.
[03:33:00.540 --> 03:33:02.660]  Find the one that works best for you.
[03:33:02.660 --> 03:33:07.300]  That is a custom phenotype for you, your clientele, and your garden.
[03:33:07.300 --> 03:33:09.260]  Now earlier I mentioned mother plants.
[03:33:09.260 --> 03:33:11.960]  We took clones off of these plants before we flowered them.
[03:33:11.960 --> 03:33:15.380]  So in a grow room somewhere, we've got five plants just hanging out.
[03:33:15.380 --> 03:33:16.460]  They're in veg.
[03:33:16.460 --> 03:33:17.620]  Maybe you were proactive.
[03:33:17.620 --> 03:33:21.260]  Maybe you decided around week seven that you really liked Arise No. 3.
[03:33:21.260 --> 03:33:25.120]  So you went in there and you found that Arise Mother Plant No. 3 and you took 10 clones.
[03:33:25.120 --> 03:33:26.120]  They're already vegging.
[03:33:26.120 --> 03:33:29.140]  They're getting big so that as soon as you harvest, you can throw those plants in there
[03:33:29.140 --> 03:33:31.820]  and you can run Arise No. 3 again.
[03:33:31.980 --> 03:33:35.980]  Maybe you were waiting for this smoke test to find out which one to run again.
[03:33:35.980 --> 03:33:38.880]  Either way, you have got that number that you decide.
[03:33:38.880 --> 03:33:40.640]  That plant is hanging out in the veg room.
[03:33:40.640 --> 03:33:41.640]  It's in there.
[03:33:41.640 --> 03:33:45.100]  You just got to go get it and take a bunch of clones off of it and run it again.
[03:33:45.100 --> 03:33:49.340]  If you narrowed it down to two that you like, cut a few clones off of each one, run them
[03:33:49.340 --> 03:33:50.460]  again side by side.
[03:33:50.460 --> 03:33:53.520]  That way you've got a larger batch of each one to decide from.
[03:33:53.520 --> 03:33:57.360]  You can run it again, maybe change the nutrients, maybe change something in the room and see
[03:33:57.360 --> 03:34:01.020]  if the two phenotypes do something different with different environments.
[03:34:01.020 --> 03:34:03.460]  Maybe that will help you decide on which one to keep.
[03:34:03.460 --> 03:34:06.660]  Either way you choose to do it, after your tasting party with your friends, you have
[03:34:06.660 --> 03:34:08.820]  got that backup plant in the veg room.
[03:34:08.820 --> 03:34:12.700]  You've got Arise No. 3 just over there waiting to take a bunch of clones so you can grow
[03:34:12.700 --> 03:34:13.700]  it again forever.
[03:34:13.700 --> 03:34:16.460]  Now the thing is, keep that plant alive.
[03:34:16.460 --> 03:34:18.540]  Listen to that episode about mother plants.
[03:34:18.540 --> 03:34:20.760]  Then you can keep that Arise No. 3 around forever.
[03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:24.660]  You can have reliable, consistent medicine that works for you, that works for your garden,
[03:34:24.660 --> 03:34:28.540]  and your people will learn to rely on you for that product.
[03:34:28.540 --> 03:34:31.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is my quick talk on pheno hunting.
[03:34:31.180 --> 03:34:33.220]  I hope I made that nice and clear for you.
[03:34:33.220 --> 03:34:35.660]  Pheno hunting is one of my favorite things to do in a grow.
[03:34:35.660 --> 03:34:36.980]  That's always a great time.
[03:34:36.980 --> 03:34:40.700]  You get some seeds, you get to find out what's in there, you narrow it down to one, and then
[03:34:40.700 --> 03:34:44.300]  a guy like me, as soon as you're down to that one, you start another pheno hunt.
[03:34:44.300 --> 03:34:47.500]  And then I'm always adding a new one and pulling an old one out of the garden.
[03:34:47.500 --> 03:34:50.580]  There's always something coming in and something going out so that I've always got some fresh
[03:34:50.580 --> 03:34:51.580]  stuff in my grows.
[03:34:51.580 --> 03:34:54.500]  I want to thank everybody for listening to this podcast.
