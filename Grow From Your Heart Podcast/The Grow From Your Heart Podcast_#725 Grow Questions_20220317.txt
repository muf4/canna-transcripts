[02:12.400 --> 02:14.480]  Let's talk about this voice.
[02:14.480 --> 02:16.840]  It sounds like I've got a head cold or something, but I do not.
[02:16.840 --> 02:20.680]  I was doing some work and I got a bunch of just a bunch of junk in my nose, a bunch of
[02:20.680 --> 02:24.800]  dust, a bunch of dirt, been cleaning up some stuff and it made me sound like total shit.
[02:24.800 --> 02:27.960]  If that's coming through on the microphone and your headphones and your equipment, I
[02:27.960 --> 02:29.200]  do apologize.
[02:29.200 --> 02:30.920]  It won't sound like this in the next episode.
[02:30.920 --> 02:33.680]  I've been trying to blow this junk out of my nose, out of my head.
[02:33.720 --> 02:35.480]  I'm just going to sound like shit for a few minutes.
[02:35.480 --> 02:36.960]  That's how life is going to be.
[02:36.960 --> 02:37.960]  We'll accept it.
[02:37.960 --> 02:39.480]  We'll have a great podcast together.
[02:39.480 --> 02:41.080]  You may not even notice it as much as I do.
[02:41.080 --> 02:44.440]  I didn't notice until I put on these headphones how strong it was, but I do notice there's
[02:44.440 --> 02:47.600]  some crap in the nose from all the dirty work I was doing today.
[02:47.600 --> 02:48.840]  Nobody cares about that.
[02:48.840 --> 02:49.840]  What else did I do today?
[02:49.840 --> 02:51.680]  I went to the weed doctor.
[02:51.680 --> 02:52.680]  That's right.
[02:52.680 --> 02:54.120]  I live here in Southern Colorado.
[02:54.120 --> 02:56.240]  In Colorado, we do have the, what is it?
[02:56.240 --> 02:58.560]  The right, the privilege of medical cannabis.
[02:58.560 --> 03:00.020]  We are offered medical marijuana here.
[03:00.020 --> 03:02.680]  We do have recreational cannabis here.
[03:02.680 --> 03:06.200]  So many people may say, why do you have your medical marijuana recommendation, your medical
[03:06.200 --> 03:07.640]  marijuana card from a doctor?
[03:07.640 --> 03:08.640]  That's a really good question.
[03:08.640 --> 03:10.280]  There are a couple of reasons for that.
[03:10.280 --> 03:12.200]  First off is it's another layer of safety.
[03:12.200 --> 03:14.200]  It's just, I do grow.
[03:14.200 --> 03:18.280]  We can grow legally here, but also having that medical card gives you another layer
[03:18.280 --> 03:19.920]  of protection for growing.
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.200]  Also it increases your purchasing power at dispensaries.
[03:23.200 --> 03:27.720]  You're limited certain amounts of milligrams at recreational dispensaries.
[03:27.720 --> 03:33.120]  At a medical cannabis dispensary, the edible dosage is much higher that is available.
[03:33.120 --> 03:34.960]  So you can get different products at different places.
[03:34.960 --> 03:35.960]  You can buy more.
[03:35.960 --> 03:39.080]  I can buy more at a medical shop than I can at a rec shop.
[03:39.080 --> 03:42.000]  There are a few advantages of it, advantages to it.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.800]  Mostly I do it to keep my garden safe.
[03:43.800 --> 03:44.880]  It does allow me.
[03:44.880 --> 03:48.760]  So one of the things I was going to talk about, we are allowed recreational and medical cannabis.
[03:48.760 --> 03:50.920]  We can have six plants here recreationally.
[03:50.920 --> 03:54.280]  You're allowed to grow six cannabis plants in your residence.
[03:54.280 --> 03:57.480]  If you're an adult and you've, if you want to grow it, that's, or you're legal right
[03:58.240 --> 03:59.240]  here.
[03:59.240 --> 04:00.240]  You can have six plants.
[04:00.240 --> 04:03.360]  Plus if you have your medical marijuana recommendation, you are allowed six more.
[04:03.360 --> 04:06.120]  So I do have the medical marijuana card for the six extra plants.
[04:06.120 --> 04:07.120]  That does help me out.
[04:07.120 --> 04:11.520]  It gives me a total of 12, not a lot of plants to play with, but twice as many as six.
[04:11.520 --> 04:12.520]  I'm grateful for that.
[04:12.520 --> 04:13.520]  It helps me out.
[04:13.520 --> 04:17.000]  It lets me do what I need to do, supply my medicine, my product that I do need.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.840]  So I did go to the weed doctor today because every year we do have to renew our medical
[04:21.840 --> 04:23.920]  marijuana cards here in Colorado.
[04:23.920 --> 04:25.720]  We do have the recreational cannabis.
[04:25.720 --> 04:27.640]  Anyone who's going to be 21 and up is allowed to have cannabis.
[04:27.640 --> 04:29.320]  They can shop in the store.
[04:29.320 --> 04:32.960]  If you've got a medical cannabis card, you can be 18.
[04:32.960 --> 04:34.360]  Most of the patients are 21 and up.
[04:34.360 --> 04:39.040]  It does require a special paperwork, more doctor visits, extra steps if you're a 18.
[04:39.040 --> 04:41.880]  But if you're a 21, then you can get that medical cannabis card.
[04:41.880 --> 04:45.400]  Then you can go to the medical dispensaries and you can have the extra plants.
[04:45.400 --> 04:48.360]  I go get the medical marijuana card once every year.
[04:48.360 --> 04:50.880]  You have to have a qualifying condition.
[04:50.880 --> 04:53.160]  Mine is that I was in a car wreck in 2003.
[04:53.160 --> 04:54.160]  My knees hit the dash.
[04:54.160 --> 04:55.160]  I was in a car wreck.
[04:55.160 --> 04:56.160]  I make a lot of terrible noises.
[04:56.160 --> 04:57.960]  My shoulder came out of the socket from the seatbelt.
[04:57.960 --> 05:01.560]  You guys don't care about medical stuff, but that is how, that's my, they call it your
[05:01.560 --> 05:04.360]  claim to fame for your medical marijuana recommendation.
[05:04.360 --> 05:06.920]  So today I had to go to the weed doctor is what I'm getting at.
[05:06.920 --> 05:09.640]  And when I used to go to the weed doctor, you would schedule an appointment.
[05:09.640 --> 05:14.160]  And if you're not watching the video, I did air quotes on the word appointment because
[05:14.160 --> 05:17.880]  back in the day when you would make an appointment to the weed doctor, you'd schedule for, it
[05:17.880 --> 05:22.000]  seemed like everybody scheduled for 10 or 11 AM.
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.680]  Sometimes you wouldn't get to see that weed doctor until five, six, maybe 7 PM.
[05:25.680 --> 05:27.800]  And you'd have to just hang out all day.
[05:27.800 --> 05:28.800]  Wait your turn.
[05:28.800 --> 05:29.960]  Wait for your name to be called.
[05:29.960 --> 05:33.080]  People would sneak off and go smoke bowls in the car or sometimes just wherever we could
[05:33.080 --> 05:35.080]  find a spot to go smoke.
[05:35.080 --> 05:38.800]  But the weed doctors were rare and they would just see a lot of patients in one day they'd
[05:38.800 --> 05:39.800]  show up.
[05:39.800 --> 05:43.520]  So this is totally illegal now and you'll understand why once I talk about it, the weed
[05:43.520 --> 05:47.520]  doctor used to come to the dispensary and set up shop in the dispensary.
[05:47.520 --> 05:50.840]  So we'd just have the weed doctor all day sign and weed cards.
[05:50.840 --> 05:52.120]  He would charge you so much.
[05:52.120 --> 05:55.300]  The dispensary would make a cut off of every card that he sold.
[05:55.300 --> 05:59.840]  So if he sold 250 weed cards today at a hundred dollars each is what I think they used to
[05:59.840 --> 06:00.840]  be.
[06:00.840 --> 06:01.840]  We would make 10 bucks.
[06:01.840 --> 06:05.920]  So we just make 10, 10% of his whole day right there just for letting them be at our dispensary.
[06:05.920 --> 06:09.560]  Then as soon as he signs that paperwork and gives you the stamp from the, what's it called?
[06:09.560 --> 06:10.560]  A notary.
[06:10.560 --> 06:12.720]  Now you're allowed to shop at the dispensary.
[06:12.720 --> 06:13.720]  You're already there.
[06:13.720 --> 06:14.720]  Why not?
[06:14.720 --> 06:15.720]  Let's spend some more money at the dispensary.
[06:15.720 --> 06:20.880]  So they quickly, once they made some rules, they quickly banned doctors being on site,
[06:20.880 --> 06:22.640]  being present at the actual dispensary.
[06:22.640 --> 06:24.320]  They had to do it at an offsite location.
[06:24.320 --> 06:25.680]  They couldn't be attached to the store.
[06:25.680 --> 06:28.960]  It was making a little bit too easy.
[06:28.960 --> 06:32.760]  But you have to go sit there all day and then you'd have to bring a file of paperwork with
[06:32.760 --> 06:37.160]  you and explain what was wrong and why you thought cannabis would help you out.
[06:37.160 --> 06:40.800]  And back in the day, the list of qualifying conditions was a little bit vague.
[06:40.800 --> 06:41.960]  It is still a little bit vague.
[06:41.960 --> 06:45.040]  I think we kind of, they kind of did that on purpose.
[06:45.040 --> 06:46.840]  I like the fact that chronic pain is on there.
[06:46.840 --> 06:48.360]  How can you prove that I don't hurt?
[06:48.360 --> 06:52.320]  If I say this hurts, can you look at my hand right now and tell me if it does or does not
[06:52.320 --> 06:53.320]  hurt?
[06:53.320 --> 06:54.360]  Look, I'll pull it up to the camera right there.
[06:54.360 --> 06:55.360]  That hurts.
[06:55.360 --> 06:56.780]  Am I full of shit or not?
[06:56.780 --> 06:59.760]  As a doctor, you've got to take my word for it that it hurts.
[06:59.760 --> 07:01.880]  So now you're going to give me my medical cannabis card, right?
[07:01.880 --> 07:03.480]  I'm going to say this hurts all the time.
[07:03.480 --> 07:04.480]  I don't know why.
[07:04.480 --> 07:05.480]  It just does.
[07:05.480 --> 07:06.480]  And you're going to say, do you do anything about it?
[07:06.480 --> 07:07.480]  No, I smoke weed and it feels better.
[07:07.480 --> 07:09.400]  And you'll go, oh, and the doctor just writes your card.
[07:09.400 --> 07:10.760]  So that's pretty much how easy it was.
[07:10.760 --> 07:12.040]  Today, I went in there.
[07:12.040 --> 07:15.320]  I had an appointment, an actual appointment for 11 o'clock.
[07:15.320 --> 07:16.320]  I'm that guy.
[07:16.320 --> 07:17.320]  I showed up 10 minutes early.
[07:17.320 --> 07:18.800]  I was like, hey, I'm here for my appointment.
[07:18.800 --> 07:19.800]  They said, oh, great.
[07:19.800 --> 07:20.800]  We've got your paperwork ready to go.
[07:20.800 --> 07:22.560]  Sign a few things, scribble your name, date some shit.
[07:22.560 --> 07:24.440]  You know how the doctor goes when you check in.
[07:24.440 --> 07:28.720]  It took me maybe five minutes to fill out some paperwork just because I know all the
[07:28.720 --> 07:29.720]  info.
[07:29.720 --> 07:30.720]  I don't have to go digging through shit.
[07:30.720 --> 07:32.400]  I know my info, my social security number, how old I am.
[07:32.400 --> 07:33.400]  I know all that shit.
[07:33.400 --> 07:34.400]  You got to write that down.
[07:34.400 --> 07:35.400]  I turned in the paper.
[07:35.400 --> 07:37.440]  They said the doctor will be right with you.
[07:37.440 --> 07:40.040]  The doctor came out with the previous patient and said, have a great day.
[07:40.040 --> 07:41.040]  It was great helping you out.
[07:41.040 --> 07:43.560]  Then she called me back and she said, you look familiar.
[07:43.560 --> 07:44.560]  It seems like I've seen you before.
[07:44.560 --> 07:49.320]  I said, I've been getting my medical cannabis card from this office since 2008.
[07:49.320 --> 07:51.560]  She basically said, okay, here you go and just started writing.
[07:51.560 --> 07:53.240]  She asked me, of course, what hurts?
[07:53.240 --> 07:54.240]  How do you use it?
[07:54.240 --> 07:58.280]  I said, oh, my knees hurt and my shoulder hurts and I take a lot of dabs.
[07:58.280 --> 08:04.040]  She said, the state wants me to type in how much you dab and how you use your product.
[08:04.040 --> 08:08.280]  I said, I'd probably dab some more between, depending on the day, some more between one
[08:08.280 --> 08:10.520]  and two grams of concentrates per day.
[08:10.520 --> 08:11.800]  She said, that's an acceptable answer.
[08:11.800 --> 08:13.680]  I look forward to seeing you next year.
[08:13.680 --> 08:18.840]  My whole appointment probably took me maybe 20, maybe 30 minutes total with like checking
[08:18.840 --> 08:19.840]  out and paying.
[08:19.840 --> 08:24.560]  There is a process where once you've seen the doctor, you do have to go onto the Colorado
[08:24.560 --> 08:26.000]  Medical Marijuana.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.160]  There's a bunch of fucking letters.
[08:27.160 --> 08:31.000]  It's the Department of Public Health and Environment, some random bullshit website where you have
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.800]  to go there and fill out your recommendation from the doctor and put in some info after
[08:35.800 --> 08:37.680]  the doctor does their part.
[08:37.680 --> 08:38.760]  Once you do that, you're good to go.
[08:38.760 --> 08:45.160]  The whole thing from parking to back in the car, the entire appointment was maybe a 30
[08:45.160 --> 08:46.160]  minute process today.
[08:46.160 --> 08:51.480]  It cost me 80 bucks to the doctor and $30 to the state of Colorado, somewhere around
[08:51.480 --> 08:52.480]  that.
[08:52.480 --> 08:57.320]  It was 80 bucks, 85 maybe to the doctor and I think it was 30 or 32 to the state of Colorado.
[08:57.320 --> 08:59.800]  We've come a long way to register with the state.
[08:59.800 --> 09:00.800]  It used to be a lot more.
[09:00.800 --> 09:05.400]  To see the doctor used to be, depending on where you went, it could be a lot, a lot more.
[09:05.400 --> 09:07.320]  Now it's really, it was quicker.
[09:07.320 --> 09:09.440]  My stuff was ready within an hour.
[09:09.440 --> 09:12.600]  Once I filed that paper with the state of Colorado, I pushed the go button.
[09:12.600 --> 09:14.680]  I got an email an hour later saying, you're approved.
[09:14.680 --> 09:15.680]  Here's your new shit.
[09:15.680 --> 09:17.600]  I used to have to wait in the mail.
[09:17.600 --> 09:18.600]  That was the hardest part.
[09:18.600 --> 09:21.480]  For a while there, they quit allowing us to have temporary cards.
[09:21.480 --> 09:24.600]  When the doctor would sign your shit, that used to mean you're good to go.
[09:24.600 --> 09:28.280]  Then you have to mail it to the state and wait for your card to come back.
[09:28.280 --> 09:31.320]  At one point they said, the paperwork, the temp paperwork is no good.
[09:31.320 --> 09:32.820]  You have to have the actual card.
[09:32.820 --> 09:36.400]  People would see the weed doctor and you have to mail your shit to the state and everybody
[09:36.480 --> 09:39.600]  got a weed card at the same time.
[09:39.600 --> 09:43.520]  Nobody was getting their actual card returned to them for six or eight weeks.
[09:43.520 --> 09:44.720]  It was supposed to take three weeks.
[09:44.720 --> 09:48.320]  It'll be 21 days, but everybody sent in their weed card.
[09:48.320 --> 09:51.000]  It felt like everybody saw the weed doctor at one day.
[09:51.000 --> 09:52.420]  They all sent in their paper.
[09:52.420 --> 09:54.120]  It took so long for people to get their card.
[09:54.120 --> 09:55.360]  Everyone's like, I did it.
[09:55.360 --> 09:56.360]  I paid the money.
[09:56.360 --> 09:57.360]  I sent my shit to the state.
[09:57.360 --> 09:58.360]  I want my weed card.
[09:58.360 --> 10:00.640]  It just took them so long to get their shit back.
[10:00.640 --> 10:02.240]  That was frustrating for a little while there.
[10:02.240 --> 10:05.520]  I was amongst that group at one point where I was like, my card should show up any day
[10:05.640 --> 10:06.640]  now.
[10:06.640 --> 10:07.640]  I'd love to go buy some weed.
[10:07.640 --> 10:11.400]  Luckily, luckily, dude, I got the hookups.
[10:11.400 --> 10:12.400]  Anyway, I'm rambling.
[10:12.400 --> 10:15.080]  The weed, the weed card went super well, super easy today.
[10:15.080 --> 10:17.680]  The doctor was really cool.
[10:17.680 --> 10:22.280]  This was every time I feel like the doctors are evolving and it's been two or three, three
[10:22.280 --> 10:25.400]  or four different doctors for most of my medical cannabis run.
[10:25.400 --> 10:28.400]  There was a guy, an old guy, an older doctor, Dr. Reimers.
[10:28.400 --> 10:29.920]  He had a couple of dogs.
[10:29.920 --> 10:30.920]  He was super cool.
[10:30.920 --> 10:31.920]  We developed a great relationship.
[10:31.920 --> 10:34.520]  I saw him probably 10 or 12 years in a row.
[10:34.520 --> 10:38.240]  He passed me off to another doctor who is now passed me off to this other doctor who
[10:38.240 --> 10:40.120]  I believe I've seen two or three times.
[10:40.120 --> 10:47.320]  The doctors are getting more savvy, more educated, more hip to cannabis, to cannabis usage, to
[10:47.320 --> 10:50.820]  cannabis verbiage, terminology, dosage.
[10:50.820 --> 10:54.140]  The doctor I saw today actually knew what she was talking about.
[10:54.140 --> 10:58.320]  She hinted and implied that she smokes medical cannabis as well.
[10:58.320 --> 11:02.400]  So it's kind of nice to see the doctor actually knowing what they're talking about.
[11:02.800 --> 11:06.320]  Before I would go and I would actually end up educating the doctor and the people in
[11:06.320 --> 11:09.240]  the room and this time she was on our level.
[11:09.240 --> 11:10.480]  So that was kind of cool.
[11:10.480 --> 11:14.120]  The process was much easier is the big note that I've got written down.
[11:14.120 --> 11:15.600]  They do not pay me to say this, you guys.
[11:15.600 --> 11:18.040]  They did not give me, they don't even know I've got a show.
[11:18.040 --> 11:22.520]  They probably don't even, they have no idea who I am, but I'm going to give medical alternatives
[11:22.520 --> 11:23.520]  a shout out.
[11:23.520 --> 11:27.320]  They're the medical cannabis doctor that I saw in Colorado Springs today.
[11:27.320 --> 11:30.400]  The process was painless and streamlined.
[11:30.400 --> 11:31.400]  The visit was great.
[11:31.400 --> 11:32.400]  The doctor was great.
[11:32.400 --> 11:33.400]  The parking was easy.
[11:33.400 --> 11:35.280]  The location was cool to get to.
[11:35.280 --> 11:39.360]  So if you've got the opportunity or the need, I would recommend medical alternatives in
[11:39.360 --> 11:40.920]  Colorado Springs.
[11:40.920 --> 11:41.920]  Just Google them.
[11:41.920 --> 11:42.960]  It will pop up.
[11:42.960 --> 11:45.140]  It does cost a few bucks.
[11:45.140 --> 11:48.160]  If you are a new patient, you may need some medical records.
[11:48.160 --> 11:53.240]  You may need to bring some, some proof that you are sick or injured and or have a qualifying
[11:53.240 --> 11:55.760]  condition that will qualify you for medical cannabis.
[11:55.760 --> 11:59.120]  Keep in mind those rules are quite flexible.
[11:59.120 --> 12:00.680]  Some paperwork will help you out though.
[12:00.680 --> 12:02.480]  Something else I want to talk about.
[12:02.480 --> 12:08.640]  They do offer what is called an extended plant count.
[12:08.640 --> 12:13.280]  In many counties in Colorado, you are not allowed to even honor the extended plant count
[12:13.280 --> 12:14.280]  if you pay for that.
[12:14.280 --> 12:15.280]  What's an extended plant count?
[12:15.280 --> 12:16.320]  Let me talk about that.
[12:16.320 --> 12:17.320]  Extended plant count.
[12:17.320 --> 12:18.960]  It sounds just like what, what it is.
[12:18.960 --> 12:22.520]  Earlier, I said I'm allowed to grow six plants for my recreational rights.
[12:22.520 --> 12:25.400]  I can just grow six just because we're in Colorado.
[12:25.400 --> 12:28.320]  I also said I can grow six more because of my medical rights.
[12:28.320 --> 12:30.160]  That gives me six more.
[12:30.160 --> 12:34.900]  My doctor could, if I of course pay them more money, that's the whole thing here.
[12:34.900 --> 12:40.840]  If I give the doctor more money and it's tiered, if I want to grow, I'm given six.
[12:40.840 --> 12:44.520]  If I want to go like, and I'm just hypothetical with the numbers because I don't remember.
[12:44.520 --> 12:47.520]  If I want to add another 10 to 12 plants, it's like another hundred bucks.
[12:47.520 --> 12:50.840]  If I want to add 20 to 30 more plants, it's like 250 more bucks.
[12:50.840 --> 12:53.280]  If I want to go up more and more plants, it just tiers it.
[12:53.280 --> 12:58.080]  It's like 350, 500, a thousand bucks depending on how many more plants you want to grow,
[12:58.080 --> 12:59.560]  which back in the day, that was awesome.
[13:00.400 --> 13:03.440]  I used to rock the shit out of those extended plant counts.
[13:03.440 --> 13:05.400]  Those used to be my best friends.
[13:05.400 --> 13:08.320]  We built dispensaries and businesses off of extended plant counts.
[13:08.320 --> 13:12.920]  I'd basically say, we'll give you a fat discount at our dispensary if you let us have your
[13:12.920 --> 13:15.560]  plant count because you could assign your plants to our dispensary.
[13:15.560 --> 13:20.240]  It was just paperwork that we used to jump around through and play with back in the day.
[13:20.240 --> 13:23.760]  The extended plant counts used to be awesome in my opinion.
[13:23.760 --> 13:29.200]  Now unfortunately, in Pueblo County where I do live, they don't care about an extended
[13:29.360 --> 13:30.360]  plant count.
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.240]  Counties have been allowed to make their own caps on plant limits.
[13:34.240 --> 13:39.120]  They can cap plant counts, they can cap grow size, they can make, the county can decide,
[13:39.120 --> 13:43.520]  they can override, they can supersede any rules that your state has made regarding your
[13:43.520 --> 13:44.520]  cannabis.
[13:44.520 --> 13:47.680]  Pueblo here, we're allowed to have 12 plants.
[13:47.680 --> 13:50.480]  Most of the counties in Pueblo are limited to 12 total.
[13:50.480 --> 13:54.520]  If you're paying for that extended plant count and you're growing that extended plant count,
[13:54.520 --> 14:00.240]  I would do a lot of research on your location and see if your location does honor or if
[14:00.240 --> 14:02.520]  it bars that extended plant count.
[14:02.520 --> 14:07.020]  Some places are limited to six, some are limited to 12, some give you 24.
[14:07.020 --> 14:10.200]  If you're in one of those properly zoned areas, they don't give a shit how many plants you
[14:10.200 --> 14:16.680]  grow as long as you're following your card limit, which could be up to 99 in some cases.
[14:16.680 --> 14:21.080]  Once you cross that 100 plant threshold, then you're in that federal zone.
[14:21.080 --> 14:25.040]  Once you have so many plants, I'm sure of it because you have to send in special paperwork
[14:25.040 --> 14:26.040]  and shit.
[14:26.040 --> 14:30.480]  You're in a computer system that says fucking, Rasta Jeff has 12 plants.
[14:30.480 --> 14:32.880]  Grower down the street, it's got 99.
[14:32.880 --> 14:35.680]  Who do you think they're going to come looking for when some shit goes wrong?
[14:35.680 --> 14:37.640]  Who's on the radar first?
[14:37.640 --> 14:38.760]  That's just my opinion.
[14:38.760 --> 14:43.440]  I'm going to grow 12, mind my own fucking business, just fly by the, what's it called?
[14:43.440 --> 14:44.840]  Fly under the radar, that's what I'm trying to say.
[14:44.840 --> 14:46.280]  All right, I'm high and rambly.
[14:46.280 --> 14:49.240]  I feel like the shit out of my nose is starting to work itself out now that I've been talking
[14:49.240 --> 14:50.240]  a little bit.
[14:50.240 --> 14:52.120]  I'm getting a little bit of water in my head.
[14:52.120 --> 14:54.600]  So the weed card went super smooth today.
[14:54.600 --> 14:56.040]  Basically what hurts?
[14:56.040 --> 14:58.360]  And I said my wallet and she said, yep, it's going to hurt more.
[14:58.360 --> 14:59.360]  Give me some money.
[14:59.360 --> 15:00.360]  And I said, here you go.
[15:00.360 --> 15:01.360]  So let's move forward.
[15:01.360 --> 15:03.840]  I did get a reply from a previous episode.
[15:03.840 --> 15:06.160]  I did an episode talking about growing seeds.
[15:06.160 --> 15:10.240]  And I said that if you leave the seeds in the plants too long, they can get too hard
[15:10.240 --> 15:12.280]  and they will not germinate properly.
[15:12.280 --> 15:13.720]  I do have a screenshot on my phone.
[15:13.720 --> 15:14.880]  The battery is almost dead.
[15:14.880 --> 15:17.080]  So let's see if we could pull this up super quickly here.
[15:17.080 --> 15:19.840]  It does say seeds don't overripe.
[15:19.840 --> 15:20.840]  It's not a fruit.
[15:20.840 --> 15:21.840]  It's a seed.
[15:21.840 --> 15:22.880]  I've never heard of them getting too hard.
[15:22.880 --> 15:24.200]  Can you explain that?
[15:24.200 --> 15:27.000]  Yeah, really quickly, nice and easily.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.040]  They get too hard.
[15:28.040 --> 15:32.640]  If you leave them in the plant for too long and you let them grow for too long, that shell,
[15:32.640 --> 15:37.960]  that outer husk, the whole, the fucking shell, dude, the seed, the bean becomes too hard
[15:37.960 --> 15:40.240]  and they simply have a hard time germinating.
[15:40.240 --> 15:41.780]  You can soak them in water.
[15:41.780 --> 15:43.800]  You can scarify them.
[15:43.800 --> 15:45.320]  You can rub them on a matchbox.
[15:45.320 --> 15:49.760]  You can do all kinds of shit to them and they don't germinate very easily.
[15:49.800 --> 15:52.880]  Sometimes you got to put them in a seed cracker, which I really don't like to do.
[15:52.880 --> 15:56.960]  But if you let the seeds go for too long, they do have the opportunity just simply to
[15:56.960 --> 15:58.640]  get too hard.
[15:58.640 --> 16:00.600]  There's not a lot of explaining to do.
[16:00.600 --> 16:04.780]  They get so hard they don't germinate and it's from letting them grow for too long.
[16:04.780 --> 16:10.080]  This is most commonly done with outdoor seeds because I'm learning to grow outdoors now
[16:10.080 --> 16:12.640]  and the outdoor seeds, excuse me for the burp, I'm going to talk right over that.
[16:12.640 --> 16:13.640]  Excuse me.
[16:13.640 --> 16:17.920]  The outdoor seeds seem to go from like, that's almost ready, almost ready, almost ready to
[16:17.920 --> 16:18.920]  fuck.
[16:18.920 --> 16:19.920]  I should have cut that down yesterday.
[16:19.920 --> 16:22.080]  Like, that's how I feel like the outdoor seeds went.
[16:22.080 --> 16:25.800]  So some of them did get really hard, really big, really fat.
[16:25.800 --> 16:27.900]  Some of them did not germinate on a couple of the plants.
[16:27.900 --> 16:28.900]  Those never went to anywhere.
[16:28.900 --> 16:29.900]  I tested those.
[16:29.900 --> 16:30.900]  I'm not happy with that.
[16:30.900 --> 16:32.920]  So those seeds will just end up on the back burner.
[16:32.920 --> 16:34.360]  You never know what those will end up doing.
[16:34.360 --> 16:37.360]  But yeah, some of the seeds simply got too hard.
[16:37.360 --> 16:39.400]  That's the best description I can give you.
[16:39.400 --> 16:40.400]  They got too hard.
[16:40.400 --> 16:41.640]  They won't germinate.
[16:41.640 --> 16:44.840]  And those are the seeds that you got to soak in water overnight or you got to put them
[16:44.840 --> 16:48.200]  in a matchbox and shake them up to where they get the shell gets a little scratched,
[16:48.200 --> 16:49.480]  a little scarified on the outside.
[16:49.480 --> 16:51.680]  Or I've seen people put them in a seed cracker.
[16:51.680 --> 16:55.240]  So that's what I mean by the seeds getting too hard.
[16:55.240 --> 16:58.280]  Another thing that can happen that we've seen happen in outdoor grows, if you leave the
[16:58.280 --> 17:02.600]  seeds in those plants too long or leave the plants out there growing too long, the humidity
[17:02.600 --> 17:07.420]  and the moisture from the outside environment or just that moisture inside the buds can
[17:07.420 --> 17:11.440]  trigger those seeds to germinate inside of the plants.
[17:11.440 --> 17:12.920]  It's really an interesting sight to see.
[17:12.920 --> 17:17.520]  It's also terrible because I know how many seeds are being wasted, but they're just sprouting
[17:17.520 --> 17:18.880]  right there inside of the buds.
[17:18.880 --> 17:20.600]  You got a bud that looks like this microphone, right?
[17:20.600 --> 17:22.800]  And just little germination tails coming out of it.
[17:22.800 --> 17:26.160]  It looks like worms climbing, little caterpillars or worms climbing out of your plant.
[17:26.160 --> 17:29.720]  So that is what happens if you leave them in there too long.
[17:29.720 --> 17:31.080]  That is also a sign.
[17:31.080 --> 17:33.960]  We're going to keep rambling here because we're on a thought process here.
[17:33.960 --> 17:38.240]  That is also a sign to me that the seeds do not need to be wintered.
[17:38.240 --> 17:41.680]  A lot of people talk about when the seeds come out of plants, they need to be cold or
[17:41.680 --> 17:44.440]  they need to be preserved for a period of time before they can grow.
[17:44.440 --> 17:46.440]  Nah, bro, they're ready right now.
[17:46.440 --> 17:47.440]  They are ready.
[17:47.440 --> 17:52.080]  They would just normally fall into a cold environment with some snow or non-ideal conditions.
[17:52.080 --> 17:54.960]  They need to wait a little while to get proper environment, then they'd sprout up.
[17:54.960 --> 17:57.600]  But no, they are ready to go when they're in that plant.
[17:57.600 --> 18:01.960]  We've seen them sprout inside the buds and ruin the entire fucking project.
[18:01.960 --> 18:04.360]  So yeah, the seeds can go too long.
[18:04.360 --> 18:05.360]  They'll get too hard.
[18:05.360 --> 18:08.080]  And if you leave them in there way too long, they will germinate.
[18:08.080 --> 18:10.520]  All right, let's keep this school bus moving.
[18:10.520 --> 18:13.680]  The next thing I want to talk about is flowering time.
[18:13.680 --> 18:17.440]  I do want to send a big shout out to my friend who reminded me to talk about this on the
[18:17.440 --> 18:18.440]  show.
[18:18.440 --> 18:21.440]  I was talking with a bro today and he's like, you know what, this, and I was like, I should
[18:21.440 --> 18:22.440]  say that on the show.
[18:22.440 --> 18:26.120]  So big shout out to my friend for reminding me to say this on the show.
[18:26.120 --> 18:27.120]  You know who you are.
[18:27.120 --> 18:29.160]  I wouldn't be where I am without you, bro.
[18:29.160 --> 18:31.160]  So something I should talk about.
[18:31.160 --> 18:32.160]  I am a seed breeder.
[18:32.160 --> 18:33.320]  I do make seeds.
[18:33.320 --> 18:38.040]  On the back of my seed packaging, I do list a recommended flowering time.
[18:38.040 --> 18:40.600]  A lot of those times are generally nine to 10 weeks.
[18:40.600 --> 18:43.040]  What I breed generally takes nine to 10 weeks.
[18:43.040 --> 18:48.300]  I know that's a general timeframe, but most of my plants will be done within that timeframe.
[18:48.300 --> 18:54.980]  When I say nine to 10 weeks, I don't mean cut it down at the beginning of week nine.
[18:54.980 --> 18:59.460]  When I say nine weeks, I recommend you finish that ninth week.
[18:59.460 --> 19:03.000]  Don't shortchange yourself by cutting down your plants way too early.
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.800]  I am recommending nine to 10 weeks and I see people cutting their plants down at the
[19:07.800 --> 19:10.280]  beginning of week nine.
[19:10.280 --> 19:16.240]  You're ripping yourself off by potentially 14, maybe 21 days of potential growth and
[19:16.240 --> 19:19.440]  improvement you could have gotten from that crop.
[19:19.440 --> 19:24.400]  Imagine how much more weight you could have gotten from 20, 14 to 21 more days of growth
[19:24.400 --> 19:26.400]  out of that plant.
[19:26.400 --> 19:30.680]  Imagine how much potency, imagine how much flavor if that plant had that much more time
[19:30.680 --> 19:31.680]  to go.
[19:31.720 --> 19:35.640]  Hypothetically, if you're cutting it down at the start of week nine, what is that?
[19:35.640 --> 19:38.160]  That's 59 days, right?
[19:38.160 --> 19:40.520]  56, 57 days.
[19:40.520 --> 19:44.920]  You should be cutting down at least day 63 is the end of week nine.
[19:44.920 --> 19:45.920]  That's the end.
[19:45.920 --> 19:48.200]  Yeah, 56 is eight weeks, 63 is nine weeks.
[19:48.200 --> 19:49.200]  Let it go.
[19:49.200 --> 19:52.440]  Technically, you've only gone eight weeks on day one of week nine.
[19:52.440 --> 19:54.160]  You've got to finish that week.
[19:54.160 --> 19:58.720]  What I'm trying to say, what I'm trying to get into your head is when I say nine weeks,
[19:58.720 --> 20:00.560]  finish the ninth week.
[20:00.560 --> 20:04.000]  If I say you've got to go to this class for nine weeks, you don't go to the class for
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.520]  eight weeks and don't go to the ninth week, then you don't graduate, you fail.
[20:07.520 --> 20:09.360]  That is the same way with growing ganja.
[20:09.360 --> 20:11.960]  You've got to finish the ninth week.
[20:11.960 --> 20:14.560]  Sometimes you've got to finish the 10th week.
[20:14.560 --> 20:19.080]  Sometimes even though I wrote nine to 10 weeks on your package, sometimes you may need to
[20:19.080 --> 20:21.880]  let that bad dog go 11 weeks.
[20:21.880 --> 20:25.160]  There are anomalies, there are outliers.
[20:25.160 --> 20:29.840]  Sometimes those longer flowering plants are the most potent, the most heavy hitting, the
[20:29.840 --> 20:33.160]  most delicious, the most impressive plants in the grow.
[20:33.160 --> 20:38.520]  When I'm saying nine to 10 weeks, I definitely mean 63 days or more.
[20:38.520 --> 20:42.480]  If you're running the first run with that plant, definitely go 70 days.
[20:42.480 --> 20:46.120]  I always recommend going longer on your first run.
[20:46.120 --> 20:47.400]  It's the inaugural run.
[20:47.400 --> 20:49.760]  We want to see the potential of that plant.
[20:49.760 --> 20:51.160]  How do you know that?
[20:51.160 --> 20:56.240]  A lot of times, plants will do special shit on the last 10 to 14 days of their flowering
[20:56.240 --> 20:57.240]  cycle.
[20:57.240 --> 21:00.360]  They'll change colors, they'll change terpenes, they'll change everything.
[21:00.360 --> 21:02.800]  It'll just go totally different right at the end there.
[21:02.800 --> 21:03.800]  That's how you know it's done.
[21:03.800 --> 21:07.440]  It goes into senescence and it expresses the end of the plant.
[21:07.440 --> 21:08.560]  Sometimes we never see that.
[21:08.560 --> 21:11.800]  How do you know that maybe at the end it just doubles in size?
[21:11.800 --> 21:13.420]  Maybe at the end it doubles in potency.
[21:13.420 --> 21:17.200]  Maybe at the end it puts off this crazy gassy terp you never noticed.
[21:17.200 --> 21:20.320]  So again, I highly recommend that you let the plants finish.
[21:20.320 --> 21:24.800]  When I say nine weeks, that means 63 days.
[21:24.920 --> 21:28.480]  When I say nine weeks, that means 70 days in breeder talk.
[21:28.480 --> 21:31.160]  I do talk in ranges and in terms.
[21:31.160 --> 21:33.520]  Keep in mind, there are anomalies in these plants.
[21:33.520 --> 21:34.940]  I said it a moment ago.
[21:34.940 --> 21:36.040]  You're going to get outliers.
[21:36.040 --> 21:37.960]  There will be phenotypical differences.
[21:37.960 --> 21:39.600]  Your grow room is different.
[21:39.600 --> 21:44.240]  Your lights, your environment, your feed, your temperature, your humidity, your VPD,
[21:44.240 --> 21:48.080]  your CO2, your abuse, your love, your care.
[21:48.080 --> 21:49.360]  Did you cuss the plants out?
[21:49.360 --> 21:50.600]  Did you give them hugs?
[21:50.600 --> 21:54.800]  All of that stuff is going to make a difference in the flowering time of these plants.
[21:54.800 --> 21:57.720]  So I highly recommend once again that you let them finish.
[21:57.720 --> 22:01.840]  When I say nine weeks, again, that is finish week nine.
[22:01.840 --> 22:04.440]  When I say 10 weeks, finish week 10.
[22:04.440 --> 22:05.520]  Don't get too excited.
[22:05.520 --> 22:07.000]  Don't get overzealous.
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.560]  Don't get eager and ruin everything.
[22:08.560 --> 22:10.180]  You vegged for how many days?
[22:10.180 --> 22:12.720]  Probably 30, 45 days, something like that.
[22:12.720 --> 22:17.000]  Then you flower for seven weeks when you should have gone for nine.
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.520]  Don't sell yourself short.
[22:18.520 --> 22:20.120]  Don't cut yourself off short.
[22:20.120 --> 22:21.640]  Don't rip yourself off.
[22:21.640 --> 22:27.200]  Set yourself up for success and reach your potential by letting these plants finish.
[22:27.200 --> 22:28.200]  Let them finish.
[22:28.200 --> 22:30.520]  Everybody's happier when you let them finish.
[22:30.520 --> 22:32.240]  All right, where do we go from there?
[22:32.240 --> 22:35.280]  I've got one more question we're going to cover on this episode.
[22:35.280 --> 22:40.680]  Somebody asked me if it would be possible to reverse one branch of a plant and pollinate
[22:40.680 --> 22:43.000]  another branch of the same plant.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.840]  And I said, yes, that would absolutely be possible.
[22:46.840 --> 22:48.760]  You can do that.
[22:48.760 --> 22:52.240]  Another thing I should mention is do not smoke reversed plants.
[22:52.240 --> 22:54.080]  I don't know if that needs to be said.
[22:54.080 --> 22:58.040]  I'm not sure if that is something that needed to be pointed out or talked about, but do
[22:58.040 --> 23:01.720]  not smoke the plants that have been treated with silver.
[23:01.720 --> 23:03.000]  Let's not do that.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.680]  It's now, it is technically a pollen donor plant.
[23:05.680 --> 23:06.840]  There are not buds on there.
[23:06.840 --> 23:07.960]  That's not smokable bud.
[23:07.960 --> 23:10.320]  You want to smoke female buds anyway.
[23:10.320 --> 23:13.520]  But many people have said that that is a problem.
[23:13.520 --> 23:16.320]  It's dangerous to smoke weed that has been sprayed with silver.
[23:16.320 --> 23:18.560]  Bro, it's, you're not, don't smoke that.
[23:18.560 --> 23:21.480]  If you're thinking about it correctly, you're not going to smoke that.
[23:21.480 --> 23:22.480]  Don't do that.
[23:22.480 --> 23:23.520]  That's my disclaimer.
[23:23.520 --> 23:25.920]  Never smoke weed that has been sprayed with silver.
[23:25.920 --> 23:26.920]  What's the next thing?
[23:26.920 --> 23:28.480]  Oh, is it possible to reverse that one branch?
[23:28.480 --> 23:29.480]  Yes.
[23:29.480 --> 23:33.560]  If you've got one plant, you can grow it and create two tops on it or two branches, however
[23:33.560 --> 23:34.680]  you want to do it.
[23:34.680 --> 23:39.200]  You can isolate one branch and treat that one branch with a silver solution at the proper
[23:39.200 --> 23:42.880]  timing, dilution, uh, schedule all the right shit.
[23:42.880 --> 23:43.880]  Treat that one branch.
[23:43.880 --> 23:45.080]  It will make pollen.
[23:45.080 --> 23:47.480]  You can let that pollen fly wherever you want.
[23:47.480 --> 23:51.040]  It's likely going to go in the whole room, but you can hit specific branches if you try
[23:51.040 --> 23:55.080]  hard enough and you can pollinate the opposite branch on that plant.
[23:55.080 --> 23:59.200]  I've done one plant where I topped it low, let it grow two big tall tops.
[23:59.200 --> 24:00.200]  I reversed one side.
[24:00.200 --> 24:04.080]  I kept the other side pure female and I just let those two dance around together and it
[24:04.080 --> 24:06.000]  made fem seeds out of one plant.
[24:06.000 --> 24:07.780]  That is definitely possible.
[24:07.780 --> 24:08.820]  You can do that.
[24:08.820 --> 24:09.820]  Have done it.
[24:09.820 --> 24:10.820]  Do that.
[24:10.820 --> 24:11.820]  Make some seeds, have some fun.
[24:11.820 --> 24:12.820]  All right.
[24:12.820 --> 24:14.920]  I think that is all the time I've got for this episode.
[24:14.920 --> 24:16.720]  There's some editing to be done here.
[24:16.960 --> 24:20.800]  I got to do some processing to make this voice sound magical.
[24:20.800 --> 24:24.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[24:24.560 --> 24:27.600]  cutters, pollen chuckers, comb heads and dread heads.
[24:27.600 --> 24:30.760]  I want to thank each and every one of you for listening to another episode of the Grow
[24:30.760 --> 24:31.760]  From Your Heart podcast.
