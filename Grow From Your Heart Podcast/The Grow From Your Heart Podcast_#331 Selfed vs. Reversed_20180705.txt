[00:01.660 --> 00:04.660]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:04.660 --> 00:07.580]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:07.580 --> 00:10.980]  your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[00:11.300 --> 00:13.820]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:13.980 --> 00:17.580]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist
[00:17.580 --> 00:20.540]  or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:20.860 --> 00:23.100]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:23.620 --> 00:25.620]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.620 --> 00:27.380]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:28.460 --> 00:29.820]  This episode of the podcast
[00:29.820 --> 00:32.300]  is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:32.460 --> 00:36.220]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[00:36.220 --> 00:39.820]  Company. You can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:40.180 --> 00:43.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong
[00:43.660 --> 00:46.780]  or start heating up that dab rig, because it's time for another episode
[00:46.780 --> 00:48.460]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:52.160 --> 00:53.240]  Yo, what's up, Internet world?
[00:53.240 --> 00:56.320]  It's time for episode 331 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:56.320 --> 00:57.760]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:57.760 --> 01:00.160]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends
[01:00.160 --> 01:01.560]  at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:01.560 --> 01:04.120]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden,
[01:04.120 --> 01:06.480]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[01:06.640 --> 01:09.960]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:10.640 --> 01:13.000]  You guys know I like to start these episodes off by letting you know
[01:13.000 --> 01:14.400]  what I'm smoking on today.
[01:14.400 --> 01:18.280]  I've been taking dabs of this soul cleanser, full spectrum extract
[01:18.480 --> 01:19.960]  from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[01:19.960 --> 01:22.240]  It is Kush Cleaner and Chem 4 together,
[01:22.680 --> 01:25.960]  and they describe it as a lemon lime sport drink, Wendex,
[01:25.960 --> 01:28.120]  and chem dog gas flavors.
[01:28.160 --> 01:32.600]  You know, the lemon lime sport drink was very, very dominant in the flavor.
[01:32.800 --> 01:35.120]  Then when you exhale, there's a hint of that Wendex,
[01:35.120 --> 01:39.280]  and I know that sounds crazy, but it tasted and had a little aroma of Wendex.
[01:39.280 --> 01:42.800]  And then the after flavor is definitely that chem dog gas
[01:42.800 --> 01:46.520]  with a little bit of the lemon lime sport drink just chilling there.
[01:46.720 --> 01:48.280]  So very well described.
[01:48.280 --> 01:51.080]  That's the soul cleanser from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.600]  Also, after that, I took a big dab of some cherry diesel live resin,
[01:55.960 --> 01:58.920]  and that seemed to put me in a really rambly, talkative mood.
[01:58.920 --> 02:02.440]  That cherry diesel was super smooth and had a candy flavor to it
[02:02.600 --> 02:03.800]  and really made my head spin.
[02:03.800 --> 02:06.200]  So the combo has got me nice and talkative.
[02:06.400 --> 02:08.360]  This should be a great podcast.
[02:08.360 --> 02:08.640]  All right.
[02:08.640 --> 02:11.280]  Before we move forward into the main topic of the podcast,
[02:11.280 --> 02:13.320]  I would like to read a couple of emails.
[02:13.320 --> 02:17.120]  This first email comes from a listener who calls himself Marco Esquendolos.
[02:17.560 --> 02:18.840]  And the email goes like this.
[02:18.840 --> 02:19.680]  Hi, Ross to Jeff.
[02:19.680 --> 02:21.440]  Thank you for your great show.
[02:21.440 --> 02:25.240]  It pains me to hear you recommend Hobby Lobby as a place to buy supplies.
[02:25.600 --> 02:28.720]  Hobby Lobby is a politically active right wing organization
[02:28.720 --> 02:31.280]  lobbying for the continuation of the war on drugs.
[02:31.600 --> 02:34.480]  You're giving your money to a corporation who would like to see you,
[02:34.480 --> 02:38.040]  your friends and your family rotting in jail for the rest of your lives.
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.040]  Now, what this email is referring to is in the trimming episode,
[02:42.040 --> 02:44.600]  I mentioned picking up your scissors at Hobby Lobby.
[02:45.720 --> 02:46.560]  This guy is correct.
[02:46.560 --> 02:48.160]  We should not be shopping at Hobby Lobby.
[02:48.160 --> 02:49.360]  Thanks for waking me up to that.
[02:49.360 --> 02:52.920]  The reason I said Hobby Lobby is because not everybody has access
[02:52.920 --> 02:54.040]  to a growth store.
[02:54.040 --> 02:57.200]  Not everybody can just drive right up to grow generation
[02:57.400 --> 03:01.720]  or one love garden supply or grow warehouse or way to grow.
[03:01.840 --> 03:03.800]  Not everybody can just zip right over there
[03:03.800 --> 03:05.960]  and shop around and get the best deal on scissors.
[03:06.520 --> 03:09.360]  I blurted out Hobby Lobby because that was my backup plan.
[03:09.360 --> 03:12.640]  When I didn't have a growth store around here, most places have a hobby lobby.
[03:13.320 --> 03:15.960]  Also, some people aren't comfortable going to the growth store.
[03:16.000 --> 03:17.880]  They can't be seen at the hydroponic store.
[03:17.880 --> 03:19.800]  They can't be seen parked out front there.
[03:19.800 --> 03:21.400]  They can't be seen in there.
[03:21.400 --> 03:22.880]  They just have to be a little more careful.
[03:22.880 --> 03:24.280]  They can go to Hobby Lobby.
[03:24.280 --> 03:26.120]  They might be going to Hobby Lobby already.
[03:26.120 --> 03:28.320]  They can just cruise over and pick up a pair of those scissors.
[03:28.320 --> 03:29.480]  But you are correct.
[03:29.480 --> 03:33.000]  We should not be shopping at Hobby Lobby if they are continuing
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.360]  to participate and support the war on drugs.
[03:35.440 --> 03:36.680]  We don't want anything to do with that.
[03:36.680 --> 03:38.760]  So let's stop giving them our money.
[03:38.760 --> 03:40.000]  Here's what I like about this email.
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.320]  Our friend, Marco Escondolas offers suggestions and other opportunities.
[03:44.320 --> 03:47.720]  He presents a problem, offers a suggestion on how to solve that problem.
[03:47.720 --> 03:50.640]  He says, instead, I suggest sending your listeners to either
[03:50.640 --> 03:54.720]  their local growth shop or a shop that supports our community like Build A Soil.
[03:55.080 --> 03:58.800]  Then he adds, I just got titanium bladed scissors for eight dollars
[03:58.800 --> 04:01.160]  and 40 cents on sale at Build A Soil.
[04:01.440 --> 04:03.440]  So you guys, that is a great option.
[04:03.440 --> 04:05.240]  Let's try to skip Hobby Lobby if we can.
[04:05.240 --> 04:06.160]  I should not have said that.
[04:06.160 --> 04:07.680]  I should not have recommended that.
[04:07.680 --> 04:08.880]  Let's skip the Hobby Lobby.
[04:08.880 --> 04:11.280]  Let's try to go somewhere that supports our community better.
[04:12.240 --> 04:15.640]  First off, let's try to shop at a local growth store that supports our community.
[04:15.680 --> 04:20.120]  If you cannot do that, then maybe find a craft store that is locally owned.
[04:20.120 --> 04:23.400]  Maybe you got a craft store owned by a little old lady and her daughter runs it.
[04:23.520 --> 04:26.920]  Maybe give them your money, but try to put your money back into your community
[04:26.920 --> 04:29.800]  and not somewhere that is going to support the war on drugs.
[04:29.920 --> 04:32.640]  If all else fails, that's when you go to Amazon.
[04:32.640 --> 04:35.200]  Our friends sent us another email saying that it's probably cheaper
[04:35.360 --> 04:38.560]  to shop at the growth store, which, yes, that is probably true.
[04:38.680 --> 04:42.160]  But not everybody has a growth store and not everybody can go to the growth store.
[04:42.560 --> 04:44.480]  So some folks are going to need a backup plan.
[04:44.480 --> 04:47.080]  Some folks are going to need a way to get their supplies discreetly.
[04:47.520 --> 04:49.280]  If you can't go to your local growth shop
[04:49.280 --> 04:52.240]  and you can't find a store that supports your community locally,
[04:52.400 --> 04:54.440]  that's when you turn to Amazon.
[04:54.440 --> 04:58.200]  But if the products are available locally and they're competitively priced
[04:58.200 --> 05:01.600]  and you don't put yourself in any jeopardy by going to a growth store,
[05:01.800 --> 05:05.080]  please shop at your local growth store that supports our community.
[05:05.320 --> 05:07.920]  If you've got a chain store or you've got a mom and pop store,
[05:08.040 --> 05:09.680]  try to support that mom and pop store.
[05:09.680 --> 05:11.560]  Let's try to spend our money wisely.
[05:11.560 --> 05:13.840]  Let's try to support people instead of businesses.
[05:14.600 --> 05:17.120]  So I owe a huge shout out to my friend Marco Esquimandolas, dude.
[05:17.120 --> 05:18.560]  Thank you for listening to the show.
[05:18.560 --> 05:20.320]  Thank you for waking me up.
[05:20.320 --> 05:23.600]  Thank you for reminding us that Hobby Lobby is not on our team.
[05:23.760 --> 05:25.160]  And thanks for the great email, dude.
[05:25.160 --> 05:26.920]  I do appreciate it.
[05:26.920 --> 05:28.960]  Rye, Rye, Rocco.
[05:28.960 --> 05:30.400]  All right, you guys have got one more email
[05:30.400 --> 05:33.160]  and then we're going to get to the main part of the podcast.
[05:33.160 --> 05:34.520]  This email goes like this.
[05:34.520 --> 05:36.960]  It says Rasta Jeff, thank you for your podcast.
[05:36.960 --> 05:38.280]  I am new to the industry.
[05:38.280 --> 05:41.120]  I've worked for the Department of Defense for 14 years now.
[05:41.400 --> 05:44.200]  I was against all things cannabis until recently.
[05:44.480 --> 05:46.320]  I really just want to say thank you.
[05:46.320 --> 05:49.480]  I listen to your podcast and the DGC podcast,
[05:49.680 --> 05:52.320]  and you all have turned me onto cannabis as medicine.
[05:52.480 --> 05:54.840]  And I wholeheartedly believe in it.
[05:55.320 --> 05:58.240]  Wow. Here's the part where I wish I had some sort of audience
[05:58.240 --> 06:01.240]  applause sound effects to insert, because that is great.
[06:01.240 --> 06:04.280]  This person worked for the Department of Defense for 14 years
[06:04.280 --> 06:06.800]  and they were against all things cannabis.
[06:07.200 --> 06:09.520]  But with the help of the Dude Grows crew and myself,
[06:09.520 --> 06:13.200]  we were able to convince this person that cannabis is medicine.
[06:13.320 --> 06:17.280]  And now they wholeheartedly believe in cannabis as medicine.
[06:17.280 --> 06:18.800]  So we have flipped this person.
[06:18.800 --> 06:20.920]  They agree with us now. Let's continue with the email.
[06:20.920 --> 06:24.120]  It says I am currently looking to get away from the enemy.
[06:24.120 --> 06:28.720]  And they say the government, Babylon and into the medical cannabis industry.
[06:29.520 --> 06:33.160]  Now that it's legal in Oklahoma, I hope to make a life of helping people
[06:33.160 --> 06:35.880]  heal and feel better about life and themselves.
[06:35.880 --> 06:40.400]  I use and have used for about a year now as my health is not what it once was.
[06:40.600 --> 06:44.240]  I've seen my dad pass away from cancer due to Agent Orange,
[06:44.240 --> 06:46.520]  and I wish he had access to cannabis.
[06:46.720 --> 06:49.880]  My mother is currently battling breast cancer and has used cannabis
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.080]  to keep her weight up, as well as myself,
[06:52.080 --> 06:55.920]  battling melanoma and currently using for anxiety and stress relief.
[06:56.680 --> 06:59.440]  Thank you for giving me good material to listen and learn from,
[06:59.440 --> 07:01.960]  as well as just making my morning commute better.
[07:02.120 --> 07:04.120]  I fully believe in cannabis.
[07:04.240 --> 07:07.880]  And now that I have been born again to the great things it can do,
[07:07.880 --> 07:10.040]  I will never turn my back on it.
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.440]  I will advocate for it and just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[07:14.800 --> 07:15.640]  Thank you.
[07:17.480 --> 07:21.240]  You guys, these messages like this are overwhelming to me.
[07:21.240 --> 07:23.400]  This is why I do the show.
[07:23.720 --> 07:26.480]  I'm not sure if I want to dance around.
[07:27.200 --> 07:29.680]  I'm not sure if I want to cry a little bit.
[07:29.680 --> 07:32.320]  I've got a huge smile and I feel a little bit numb.
[07:32.680 --> 07:35.400]  These messages make all of this effort worth it.
[07:36.160 --> 07:39.840]  These messages make every frustrating minute behind this microphone.
[07:40.320 --> 07:43.200]  These messages make every second of writing this podcast.
[07:43.720 --> 07:47.320]  These messages make the couple of hours that I miss doing other things with my
[07:47.320 --> 07:49.760]  friends. Sometimes I got to skip out on shit because I have to record,
[07:49.760 --> 07:51.560]  Hey bro, you want to go down and do this? Nah, man,
[07:51.560 --> 07:54.240]  I'm gonna record a podcast and all my friends go have fun. I'm here recording.
[07:54.960 --> 07:58.200]  These messages make everything I've missed worth it.
[07:58.240 --> 08:02.960]  These messages make every night I've stayed up late to edit a show worth it.
[08:03.480 --> 08:06.080]  Messages like this are why I have a podcast.
[08:06.080 --> 08:08.320]  Messages like this are what we are here for.
[08:08.360 --> 08:10.600]  This is why we have a cannabis community.
[08:10.880 --> 08:15.040]  We found a friend who was part of the department of defense and was against
[08:15.040 --> 08:16.120]  cannabis. Okay?
[08:16.480 --> 08:21.480]  Now they are dedicating their lives to helping other people learn
[08:21.560 --> 08:26.200]  how to use cannabis to better their lives, to improve their wellbeing,
[08:26.360 --> 08:27.800]  to enjoy their life better.
[08:27.800 --> 08:31.040]  This person has done a one 80 they were on the other team.
[08:31.200 --> 08:33.160]  Now they are fully supporting our team.
[08:33.160 --> 08:34.960]  So that's what our podcasts are doing. You guys,
[08:35.000 --> 08:36.560]  that's what our advocating is doing.
[08:37.000 --> 08:40.440]  This is what standing up and speaking up for ourselves and speaking out for
[08:40.440 --> 08:43.160]  ourselves has done. We are able to help more people.
[08:43.160 --> 08:45.560]  We are convincing more people that this is a medicine.
[08:45.880 --> 08:49.600]  So this person wrote this email to say thank you. And I appreciate the thanks,
[08:49.800 --> 08:53.880]  but thank you because this is the best compliment that I could have received.
[08:53.880 --> 08:57.000]  This is the best email I could have gotten all week. This made my day.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.280]  This made my week. So thank you. I truly appreciate this.
[09:01.200 --> 09:04.880]  Now I also want to say, I'm sorry that you lost your dad to cancer from agent.
[09:04.880 --> 09:06.040]  Orange. That is terrible,
[09:06.040 --> 09:10.080]  but I am proud of you for being able to help your mom with her breast cancer.
[09:10.080 --> 09:11.760]  I hope that helps her keep her weight up.
[09:12.040 --> 09:15.840]  And also I hope you say that you're using cannabis to fight your melanoma and
[09:15.840 --> 09:18.960]  using it for anxiety and stress relief. Perfect uses.
[09:19.080 --> 09:20.880]  I hope that continues to work for you.
[09:21.400 --> 09:25.560]  People often forget that our mental health is just as important as our physical
[09:25.640 --> 09:26.160]  health.
[09:26.160 --> 09:30.560]  And sometimes that little mind escape that cannabis brings you can be a healthy
[09:30.560 --> 09:32.440]  thing. You forget that you're sick.
[09:32.480 --> 09:36.200]  You forget that you're in pain and you're able to relax and enjoy your life for a
[09:36.200 --> 09:38.760]  little bit. And that's what it's all about. Enjoying life,
[09:38.760 --> 09:42.520]  improving the quality of life. So this is a great email. Thank you.
[09:42.680 --> 09:46.840]  I'm proud of you. Thanks for joining our team. And thank you for thanking me.
[09:46.840 --> 09:50.040]  I think this feeling is mutual. We agree. So thanks a lot.
[09:50.040 --> 09:53.520]  You have made my day. If you guys have any more questions,
[09:53.520 --> 09:57.080]  or if there's anything that I or my audience can do to help your mom or yourself
[09:57.080 --> 10:01.680]  out, please let me know. Just reach out to me. We would love to be there for you.
[10:01.920 --> 10:06.760]  Also take a fat dab and hug your mom for me. Hey, thank you for the great email.
[10:06.760 --> 10:10.560]  I do appreciate that. I get a lot of praise and a lot of thanks for the podcast,
[10:10.800 --> 10:14.520]  but messages like this always touch me, you guys. So don't ever stop, please.
[10:14.880 --> 10:17.080]  And if anybody else out there would like to send me an email,
[10:17.080 --> 10:19.160]  letting me know about their change of heart,
[10:19.480 --> 10:23.000]  or maybe how you've convinced another family member that cannabis would be
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.400]  useful, or maybe how you've turned somebody else from the dark side to the green
[10:26.400 --> 10:29.480]  side, I would love to hear your story. I would love to hear your input.
[10:30.040 --> 10:31.480]  If you'd like to share your story with me,
[10:31.520 --> 10:36.200]  my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I look forward to it.
[10:36.960 --> 10:39.480]  All right, you guys, I've been going for just over 10 minutes now.
[10:39.480 --> 10:41.560]  I haven't taken a drink. I haven't taken a dab.
[10:41.800 --> 10:45.440]  I'm going to press pause for a quick second, probably play some music for you.
[10:45.640 --> 10:48.960]  I'm going to take a couple of dabs while that music plays. And when we come back,
[10:49.120 --> 10:54.120]  we're going to talk about the difference between R1 and S1 labeling on seed
[10:55.000 --> 11:53.560]  packages. All right, podcast world, I am back.
[11:53.560 --> 11:57.400]  Remember those dabs I was telling you about? They worked, they are working.
[11:57.800 --> 12:00.480]  I'm feeling great. I'm well hydrated. I'm well medicated.
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.120]  And I am back to talk about podcasting. Before we get into the main topic,
[12:04.600 --> 12:06.440]  I've got one more thing I'd like to remind you about.
[12:06.440 --> 12:10.600]  And that one thing is Patreon. If you feel like this podcast was educational,
[12:10.600 --> 12:11.920]  entertaining, or informative,
[12:12.080 --> 12:13.960]  and you'd like to contribute financially to the show,
[12:13.960 --> 12:18.640]  you can do so by going to www.patreon.com
[12:18.640 --> 12:19.840]  slash growfromyourheart.
[12:19.880 --> 12:23.520]  All of the information that you need will be right there. You guys,
[12:23.520 --> 12:27.360]  I offer several different gifts or rewards for my Patreon contributors.
[12:27.840 --> 12:30.880]  That's the quickest way to get your email right on a show or the quickest way to
[12:30.880 --> 12:31.960]  get a shout out from me.
[12:32.120 --> 12:36.640]  But I also offer things like a 30 minute one-on-one consultation through
[12:36.640 --> 12:39.480]  FaceTime or Skype. We can look at your grow room.
[12:39.680 --> 12:41.480]  You can bring your plant right up to the camera.
[12:41.640 --> 12:44.480]  You can show me what's going on with your plants and we can diagnose a problem.
[12:44.480 --> 12:47.240]  If you've got a problem, or we can walk through your grow room.
[12:47.240 --> 12:49.760]  If you've got your phone and we can just look at your grow and figure out what's
[12:49.760 --> 12:51.920]  going on, we can figure out how to improve your grow.
[12:52.320 --> 12:55.160]  Or if you've got any weird growing questions that you don't feel like you can,
[12:55.320 --> 12:58.560]  we can answer through emails or whatever. You can get personal consultations.
[12:58.960 --> 13:01.040]  The way to do that is through the Patreon campaign.
[13:01.640 --> 13:06.640]  And the way to find the Patreon page is www.patreon.com
[13:06.800 --> 13:10.280]  slash grow from your heart. All right, enough of that.
[13:10.320 --> 13:14.800]  Let's talk about feminized seeds and feminized seed
[13:15.040 --> 13:17.480]  labeling. If you guys pay attention to the show,
[13:17.680 --> 13:19.520]  or if you pay attention to iReed genetics,
[13:19.720 --> 13:24.080]  you know that I am making golden goat feminized seeds and more lemon Jeffrey
[13:24.120 --> 13:28.080]  feminized seeds. The golden goat will be straight golden goat.
[13:28.120 --> 13:31.480]  I took a golden goat female and turned it into a male.
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.920]  I use that male golden goat pollen and put that to a golden goat female,
[13:37.760 --> 13:38.880]  which will make seeds.
[13:39.160 --> 13:43.080]  They will only have female chromosomes because there was no male involved.
[13:43.080 --> 13:46.000]  I reversed a female. It will only have female chromosomes,
[13:46.040 --> 13:48.200]  and it will only have golden goat genetics.
[13:49.080 --> 13:51.960]  So those seeds will be golden goat S1s.
[13:52.800 --> 13:55.960]  Now in the same project, I am making lemon Jeffrey.
[13:56.280 --> 14:01.280]  Lemon Jeffrey is a lemon skunk female pollinated by that reversed golden goat
[14:02.080 --> 14:02.920]  male.
[14:03.840 --> 14:08.840]  So that's golden goat pollen with no male chromosomes applied to a lemon skunk
[14:10.840 --> 14:15.840]  female that will produce feminized lemon Jeffrey R1 seeds.
[14:16.880 --> 14:18.800]  Now, before I get into the R1 and S1,
[14:18.800 --> 14:23.200]  let's quickly talk about regular non-feminized seed breeding labels.
[14:23.400 --> 14:26.720]  If I were to breed something non-feminized, we'll use a rise as an example,
[14:27.120 --> 14:30.160]  a rise is a golden goat female to a daybreaker male.
[14:30.400 --> 14:35.240]  You would put in parentheses, golden goat X daybreaker in parentheses.
[14:35.240 --> 14:38.480]  That's golden goat to daybreaker. That would make a rise F1.
[14:39.080 --> 14:42.320]  F1 indicates first filial generation,
[14:42.320 --> 14:44.920]  which means it's the first time that strain has been crossed.
[14:45.200 --> 14:49.360]  If I take that strain and find a male and a female and breed them together,
[14:49.560 --> 14:52.560]  what comes out of that will be the F2 and so forth.
[14:52.680 --> 14:55.520]  So that's where the F comes in and regular seed breeding.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.680]  When you're breeding with feminized seeds,
[14:57.880 --> 15:01.000]  that's when the F is replaced with R's or S's.
[15:01.040 --> 15:05.080]  Now let's talk about the R's and S's. Let's start with S first.
[15:05.600 --> 15:09.360]  If you see a seed package and it is labeled golden goat S1,
[15:09.800 --> 15:14.800]  that indicates that those seeds came from a reversed golden goat female that was
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.720]  turned into a male that pollen was used on another golden goat plant.
[15:18.920 --> 15:20.120]  And it is itself.
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.600]  The letter S indicates that it is itself and no other genetics were introduced
[15:24.600 --> 15:25.600]  into that cross.
[15:25.840 --> 15:29.280]  Now a good reason for doing that is to preserve genetics.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.200]  Let's say that I get tired of growing golden goat or something goes wrong and I
[15:33.200 --> 15:34.640]  can't have golden goat anymore.
[15:34.800 --> 15:38.960]  Or let's say maybe there's a fire or a flood and my golden goat plant gets
[15:38.960 --> 15:39.800]  destroyed.
[15:39.880 --> 15:44.760]  I have got S1 seeds of golden goat to keep it in preservation.
[15:45.360 --> 15:50.360]  The seeds that I release for golden goat are S1 seeds because it is a female
[15:50.600 --> 15:52.720]  plant. I do not have a male.
[15:52.760 --> 15:55.680]  There is no known male of golden goat floating around.
[15:55.920 --> 16:00.920]  So the only way you could make more seeds of golden goat would be to reverse it
[16:01.440 --> 16:04.400]  and make self seeds out of it, make S1s.
[16:04.400 --> 16:06.200]  And that is good for self preservation.
[16:06.560 --> 16:09.680]  It's also good to get those genetics out to people in other places that don't
[16:09.680 --> 16:12.240]  have access to the clones. You can get the seeds out to people.
[16:12.400 --> 16:15.680]  That way everybody's got the opportunity to grow something similar,
[16:15.840 --> 16:17.600]  very similar to golden goat.
[16:18.200 --> 16:21.760]  So S stands for self and that is selfing a plant.
[16:21.960 --> 16:25.080]  That is for self preservation and preserving genes.
[16:25.080 --> 16:28.120]  It doesn't adulterate those genes with anything else.
[16:28.560 --> 16:31.680]  If you were to cross the golden goat to something else,
[16:31.800 --> 16:34.200]  you've created a new cross, say the daybreaker,
[16:34.440 --> 16:38.760]  then you could find a male that looks like that golden goat and do that to the
[16:38.760 --> 16:41.760]  original golden goat female. And now you've created a back cross,
[16:41.760 --> 16:42.440]  which is different.
[16:42.440 --> 16:45.200]  That's non-feminized and you're going to have a lot of variation.
[16:45.440 --> 16:49.080]  You're going to have to work that. But the feminized route, the self route,
[16:49.280 --> 16:52.840]  there is no adulteration, no introduction of new genes.
[16:52.960 --> 16:56.560]  So it's really easy to get exactly the golden goat you're looking for.
[16:56.720 --> 16:58.120]  So that is selfing.
[16:58.240 --> 17:03.320]  Selfing is taking a plant and making seeds of itself without adulterating
[17:03.320 --> 17:06.600]  its genetic makeup. Now that we understand selfing,
[17:06.600 --> 17:10.360]  let's talk about R. R stands for reversal.
[17:10.360 --> 17:13.160]  And R1 is a first generation of a reversal.
[17:13.480 --> 17:16.720]  If I were to take that feminized golden goat pollen that we were talking about
[17:16.760 --> 17:20.600]  earlier and put that on a different plant that is not golden goat.
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.080]  Now we have created what's called a reversal and that will be feminized and it
[17:25.080 --> 17:28.320]  will be a new cross. Lemon Jeffrey is an R1.
[17:28.560 --> 17:32.800]  That is feminized golden goat pollen on a lemon skunk female.
[17:33.000 --> 17:36.880]  And that makes a brand new cross. So that's a reversal one.
[17:36.880 --> 17:41.000]  It's an R1 is what you would label that. That would be your Lemon Jeffrey R1.
[17:42.440 --> 17:45.600]  Let's talk more about an R1. What is the purpose of an R1?
[17:45.600 --> 17:50.080]  The purpose of an R1 is to create new and unique feminized crosses.
[17:50.200 --> 17:52.080]  I know a lot of people are haters on fem seeds,
[17:52.520 --> 17:56.440]  but they are very useful for people with limited plant counts and for people
[17:56.440 --> 17:59.760]  that can't risk wasting time and space on having a male plant.
[17:59.760 --> 18:03.240]  So there is an application for them. I do not hate them. I support them.
[18:03.320 --> 18:06.920]  I make them myself. So the short version of this story would be,
[18:07.000 --> 18:11.080]  if you reversed a plant and put the pollen on itself, that is a self.
[18:11.440 --> 18:14.920]  If you reverse a plant and put that pollen on any other cultivar,
[18:15.280 --> 18:17.640]  you have just created a new reversal.
[18:18.120 --> 18:21.160]  Both of those the R1 and the S1 are both feminized.
[18:21.400 --> 18:25.280]  Now let's talk about phenotype expectations from the two of those.
[18:25.800 --> 18:27.640]  Obviously, if you're doing an S1,
[18:27.960 --> 18:32.440]  you hope to find really close representations of your original
[18:32.600 --> 18:33.440]  female plant.
[18:34.080 --> 18:37.440]  You're going to see some traits of the parents of that plant,
[18:37.680 --> 18:41.320]  but it's going to be very close representations of the original plant.
[18:41.320 --> 18:44.400]  You start with some will lean towards the mom, some will lean toward the dad,
[18:44.640 --> 18:48.520]  but most of those phenotypes that come from those fem seeds are going to look a
[18:48.520 --> 18:51.640]  lot like the original plant you started with.
[18:52.400 --> 18:55.400]  Now let's talk about the phenotypes from reversals.
[18:55.600 --> 18:58.920]  Reversals show phenotypes a lot like regular breeding.
[18:58.920 --> 19:02.840]  You're going to see a perfect 50-50 blend of the two parents you start with.
[19:03.240 --> 19:05.880]  You'll see some that look a lot like the female you started with.
[19:05.880 --> 19:08.480]  You'll see some that look a lot like the dad you started with.
[19:08.720 --> 19:11.560]  You may get little indicators of the grandparents.
[19:12.480 --> 19:16.720]  Reversals are going to show you different phenotypes a lot like normal breeding,
[19:16.880 --> 19:20.720]  but I think a little bit of variation is to be desired when you're working with
[19:20.720 --> 19:22.680]  seeds. That's why I like to grow from seed.
[19:22.880 --> 19:26.720]  If I wanted everything to look exactly the same, I would grow from clones.
[19:27.240 --> 19:30.600]  So expect to see a little bit of phenotypical variation if you're running
[19:30.600 --> 19:33.680]  reversals. If you're running selves out of a six pack,
[19:33.680 --> 19:38.200]  you will definitely find the one that looks just like the one on the package or
[19:38.200 --> 19:41.120]  just like the one you saw on the website or just like the one that you smoked
[19:41.120 --> 19:44.720]  somewhere that got you super excited about it. Now you've got that cross.
[19:44.720 --> 19:48.360]  Now you've got that specific phenotype and you can grow it for yourself all the
[19:48.360 --> 19:51.640]  time. Make sure you take a clone. Oh, please make sure you take a clone.
[19:52.400 --> 19:52.880]  All right, you guys,
[19:52.880 --> 19:56.280]  I feel like I broke down the difference between reversals and self seeds.
[19:56.280 --> 19:57.320]  Both are feminized.
[19:57.560 --> 20:00.840]  The main difference again is if I took that pollen from one plant and applied it
[20:00.840 --> 20:05.640]  to itself or applied that pollen to different plants, self is S1.
[20:05.680 --> 20:09.680]  Anything else becomes a reversal. That's an R1. Keep that in mind.
[20:10.160 --> 20:13.320]  Always keep in mind when you're labeling genetic crosses that you list the female
[20:13.320 --> 20:16.080]  first. Ladies first all the time. So when you're listing genetics,
[20:16.080 --> 20:19.160]  it should go female X male. That's how you list your crosses.
[20:19.160 --> 20:20.680]  Then you put the name right up above that.
[20:20.680 --> 20:22.760]  So ladies first all the time when you're listing genetics.
[20:23.120 --> 20:26.240]  I see a lot of people cross that one up on the internet and why does it matter?
[20:26.240 --> 20:27.280]  Because it's a different cross.
[20:27.760 --> 20:30.960]  A golden goat to daybreaker and daybreaker to golden goat are two different
[20:30.960 --> 20:35.520]  crosses. So that does matter. You should list it correctly. All right, you guys,
[20:35.520 --> 20:37.360]  I want to give a couple of really quick shout outs.
[20:37.360 --> 20:39.000]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Tyler,
[20:39.160 --> 20:43.560]  a shout out to Miles Porter and a huge shout out to Maddie E. All right,
[20:43.560 --> 20:44.960]  you guys, before I start wrapping up this show,
[20:44.960 --> 20:46.720]  I've got one more thing I'd like to talk about.
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.680]  I get a lot of messages from people asking, how do I get into this industry?
[20:52.320 --> 20:56.000]  How do I get a big grow started? How do I move to Colorado?
[20:56.200 --> 21:00.040]  How do I get a facility? How do I get licensed? How do I get plants?
[21:00.240 --> 21:03.760]  How do I set it up? Can you teach me to grow? Can you help me do this?
[21:04.720 --> 21:08.240]  The first step to that you guys is to learn to grow some cannabis.
[21:08.440 --> 21:13.040]  Don't buy a big facility. Don't get a big ass license. Get a light,
[21:13.520 --> 21:16.560]  get some seeds, learn how to germinate a 10 pack of seeds.
[21:16.840 --> 21:21.720]  Learn how to run a crop from seed to harvest. Learn how to identify males.
[21:21.960 --> 21:26.000]  Learn how to grow the product before you even think about a big facility.
[21:26.600 --> 21:28.120]  Master a small facility.
[21:28.560 --> 21:30.760]  I see so many people that don't know how to grow.
[21:31.200 --> 21:34.480]  Think they're just going to jump into it and master this. You guys,
[21:34.480 --> 21:38.440]  I've been at this for a long time and I still experienced crop problems.
[21:38.680 --> 21:42.280]  I still get spider mites occasionally. I still see powdery mildew.
[21:42.480 --> 21:47.280]  The thing is I've experienced it in small enough grows to where I know how to
[21:47.280 --> 21:50.440]  deal with it. And I've learned how to adjust that to larger grows.
[21:51.040 --> 21:55.840]  When you walk into your multimillion dollar facility with 250 lights and you see
[21:55.840 --> 21:56.720]  spider mites in there,
[21:56.720 --> 21:59.720]  you're going to shit your pants because you've never dealt with it.
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.840]  If you've dealt with it on a small scale,
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.280]  if you've had one pound of cannabis at risk,
[22:04.640 --> 22:08.240]  if that was going to be your loss from those spider mites, that's okay.
[22:08.480 --> 22:11.320]  That's your one pound of extra money that you were going to make.
[22:11.320 --> 22:14.160]  You may not get to have as much fun this summer. That's cool.
[22:14.800 --> 22:19.800]  When you walk into that facility and you see 500 pounds at risk from spider
[22:20.000 --> 22:21.680]  mites, you're going to get anxious.
[22:22.160 --> 22:25.600]  You're going to sweat in places you didn't know you had sweat glands.
[22:25.800 --> 22:27.600]  It's going to make you sick to your fucking stomach.
[22:27.640 --> 22:29.080]  You're not going to be ready for it.
[22:29.400 --> 22:30.240]  You're going to panic.
[22:30.360 --> 22:33.600]  You're going to do more shit wrong to cause more problems.
[22:34.320 --> 22:36.280]  Before you think about building a warehouse,
[22:36.400 --> 22:40.400]  before you think about a 10 lighter, before you think about six or four lights,
[22:40.880 --> 22:44.760]  hang up a light, learn how to grow, build a relationship with the plant,
[22:45.120 --> 22:49.040]  understand the cycles of the plant, understand what that plant needs,
[22:49.560 --> 22:53.680]  understand your goal with the plant, understand why you're doing it.
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.080]  Before you go build yourself a giant facility and invest all of your money and
[22:58.080 --> 23:01.360]  risk losing everything, figure out if you can do this.
[23:02.320 --> 23:05.520]  And also don't become one of those owners that's just money hungry.
[23:05.680 --> 23:09.880]  If you stop and you build yourself a small grow and you grow a few plants,
[23:10.200 --> 23:15.280]  you'll build a relationship with the plant, not just a financial relationship.
[23:15.520 --> 23:18.600]  You'll actually have a connection. It feels really good to grow cannabis.
[23:18.800 --> 23:20.000]  You fall in love with your garden.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.400]  You fall in love with your plants and they make you feel good.
[23:23.040 --> 23:24.440]  Before you even smoke them,
[23:24.560 --> 23:27.440]  you get to feel rewarded because you watch them grow.
[23:27.840 --> 23:29.920]  So you won't be one of these money hungry owners.
[23:30.080 --> 23:32.000]  You'll actually understand what's going on.
[23:32.320 --> 23:35.960]  You'll understand that when I tell you this is going to be 14 weeks until I
[23:35.960 --> 23:39.760]  harvest this, I've got veg, I've got flour. Then we cut it down.
[23:39.960 --> 23:42.920]  A lot of owners will say 14 weeks, huh? I'll be back in 12 weeks.
[23:42.920 --> 23:45.440]  We'll cut it down. And you say, dude, I said 14 and they go, yeah,
[23:45.440 --> 23:48.080]  11 weeks sounds great. And you're like, wait a minute. I thought I,
[23:48.080 --> 23:50.200]  I thought you said 12 last time. And the accountant goes, yeah,
[23:50.200 --> 23:53.240]  10 weeks will be perfect. Like that's how that shit works.
[23:53.480 --> 23:56.880]  So don't be that guy. Build a relationship with the plant,
[23:57.160 --> 23:58.320]  understand the cycles,
[23:58.360 --> 24:03.040]  understand why the growers are being so meticulous with what they're doing.
[24:03.080 --> 24:05.200]  Understand why the growers need your patience.
[24:05.800 --> 24:08.800]  I really think that starting small with one, two,
[24:08.800 --> 24:11.680]  maybe three lights at the most is the way to go.
[24:11.840 --> 24:14.640]  I would recommend you start off with a thousand watt light for flowering and a
[24:14.640 --> 24:18.400]  thousand watt light for vegging and be able to run a perpetual cycle.
[24:18.840 --> 24:21.720]  Never have an interruption. Every time you cut down a crop,
[24:21.920 --> 24:24.640]  move more veg plants in. Every time you cut down a crop,
[24:24.760 --> 24:27.920]  move more veg plants in, you should always have a cycle going before you can
[24:27.920 --> 24:32.040]  master that. Don't even think about running a large facility. So you guys,
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.720]  my point here is start small and then go big because I see a lot of people try
[24:36.720 --> 24:39.200]  to start these big facilities. They run into problems.
[24:39.200 --> 24:43.000]  They were never prepared for they've got zero experience and it turns into
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.120]  absolute catastrophic failure and it's expensive and it's embarrassing.
[24:47.120 --> 24:51.640]  So you guys start off small, learn small, fail, small,
[24:51.680 --> 24:53.960]  learn how to correct your failures on a smaller level.
[24:54.200 --> 24:55.560]  And then once you get good at that shit,
[24:55.880 --> 24:59.200]  then expand and then you're going to fuck up that too and learn how to rescue a
[24:59.200 --> 25:00.040]  bigger crop.
[25:00.360 --> 25:04.480]  And if your main goal is to grow for a commercial production facility or run
[25:04.500 --> 25:06.320]  your own commercial production facility,
[25:06.640 --> 25:10.720]  start learning commercial horticulture practices.
[25:10.720 --> 25:14.240]  Now don't become a home grower. Don't become a basement grower.
[25:14.240 --> 25:17.880]  Don't become a garage grower, become a commercial cultivator. Yes,
[25:17.880 --> 25:21.160]  you may be doing it at home, but you can still have the mindset.
[25:21.400 --> 25:24.840]  Start thinking what products am I allowed and not allowed to use?
[25:25.080 --> 25:27.800]  What is sustainable? What is non-sustainable?
[25:27.800 --> 25:31.040]  Start thinking about man hours. Start thinking about electricity.
[25:31.240 --> 25:33.800]  Run your personal grow as if it were a business.
[25:33.820 --> 25:38.440]  If your plan is to have a business with your grow. All right, you guys,
[25:38.440 --> 25:41.320]  I feel like I ranted on that way longer than I had intended.
[25:41.320 --> 25:44.760]  So thanks for listening to that. Let's start wrapping up this podcast.
