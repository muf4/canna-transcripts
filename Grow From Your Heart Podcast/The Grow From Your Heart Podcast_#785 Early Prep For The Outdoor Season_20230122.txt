[02:44.260 --> 02:46.780]  All right, where do we go from there in this episode?
[02:46.780 --> 02:49.560]  I am going to give away a pack of seeds the seed giveaway
[02:49.560 --> 02:52.780]  Of course is sponsored by our friends at seeds here now calm
[02:52.820 --> 02:59.100]  Make sure you check out seeds here now calm and also follow them on all of these social media applications
[02:59.100 --> 03:03.860]  Of course, we will give away those seeds here toward the end of this episode before we get to that part
[03:03.860 --> 03:06.540]  Let's talk about the main topic of today's episode
[03:06.540 --> 03:12.220]  It is January right now as we record this episode the middle of January spring is approaching
[03:12.220 --> 03:17.240]  It is almost time for the outdoor season. It doesn't seem like it's time to start thinking about that yet
[03:17.240 --> 03:21.940]  We've got five maybe six months before plants are going outside, but let's get prepared
[03:21.940 --> 03:26.700]  It's never too early to start preparing our ganja grow if we're going to put plants outside
[03:26.700 --> 03:31.580]  I always recommend putting out something that we have tested at least something that we have sex
[03:31.660 --> 03:35.280]  Tested a lot of growers that grow on the coast that are able to grow bigger crops
[03:35.280 --> 03:41.420]  They are already sprouting their seeds already cutting their clones getting their plants ready for June and July and August
[03:41.660 --> 03:46.220]  Which is six seven eight months away. But by the time it comes time to put those plants outside
[03:46.220 --> 03:48.680]  They're going to have big beefy
[03:49.020 --> 03:54.440]  Monstrous plants so if you don't have clones if you don't have something ready now that you already know is a female that has been
[03:54.440 --> 03:58.960]  Tried and true now is the time to start prepping and planning for your outdoor grow
[03:59.400 --> 04:03.980]  The first thing to think about is do you have a reliable source for seeds or clones?
[04:03.980 --> 04:10.520]  Of course, you can get seeds at seeds here now calm or I read direct comm do some shopping find what works best for you
[04:10.560 --> 04:16.280]  But now is the time to start getting those seeds if you don't already have them start shopping start doing research
[04:16.280 --> 04:18.440]  We're going to talk about what research needs to be done
[04:18.480 --> 04:23.600]  But now is the time to start getting those seeds then as soon as you get those seeds
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.760]  I recommend germinating them and start vegging them. Yes. It is very early
[04:27.760 --> 04:30.680]  We've got a lot of time to go before the outdoor season comes
[04:30.680 --> 04:33.240]  But do you want to put some random untested?
[04:33.240 --> 04:39.780]  Unvetted seeds outdoors or would you like to maybe give them an audition run run them one time before you put them outside that way
[04:39.780 --> 04:43.840]  You can do a quick phenol hunt find the plant that you like best then put that one outdoors
[04:44.040 --> 04:49.900]  And make several clones of it and fill the outdoor garden with that. I understand not everybody has an indoor garden
[04:49.900 --> 04:54.720]  This isn't an option for everybody, but this will help you out in the long run if you are able to do this
[04:54.720 --> 05:00.860]  I recommend getting a pack of seeds start vegging them now. I highly recommend sexing those plants
[05:00.860 --> 05:05.520]  There are many ways to do that. You can grow them up to big enough to get a clone from them
[05:05.520 --> 05:06.780]  That's up to you to determine
[05:06.780 --> 05:11.820]  Get a clone then you can either put the original plant into flower or you can put that clone into flower
[05:12.100 --> 05:15.900]  Within 10 to 14 days you will know if you've got male or female plants
[05:15.900 --> 05:20.280]  You can throw away all of the males and all the male plants and corresponding clones and keep the females
[05:20.400 --> 05:27.260]  Run those and do that phenol hunt to find the desirable phenotype for your area for your needs another way we can do it
[05:27.700 --> 05:33.700]  We can put these plants under 1212 lighting put them into flower for 10 to 14 days and soon enough
[05:33.700 --> 05:35.580]  They will begin to show you their sex
[05:35.580 --> 05:40.100]  It won't take long for those plants to start showing you their sex as soon as you identify males
[05:40.380 --> 05:45.020]  Remove them let them flower until you've positively identified the sex of all of those plants
[05:45.020 --> 05:47.980]  Then simply put the timer back to a vegetative state
[05:47.980 --> 05:52.140]  You can go to 24 on and 0 off or 18 6 will also work for you
[05:52.140 --> 05:55.540]  I do my mother plants at 19 5 I like them to sleep a little bit
[05:55.540 --> 05:58.940]  But I also need to give them extra light because I've got some tropical
[05:59.060 --> 06:02.600]  Varietals that will try to flower on me if they don't get enough light time
[06:02.700 --> 06:06.220]  So those are two easy ways that you can quickly sex your plants
[06:06.220 --> 06:08.780]  You can cut a clone as soon as it is time to cut a clone
[06:08.780 --> 06:13.420]  You can either put that clone dome in the flower room or you can put the original plants in the flower room
[06:13.740 --> 06:15.220]  Within 10 to 14 days
[06:15.220 --> 06:21.500]  You will have identified the males and females or you can simply flower out your original plants and then revege them
[06:21.500 --> 06:23.540]  It won't take long to revert them back to veg
[06:23.540 --> 06:26.780]  If you're only in flower for 10 14, maybe 17 days
[06:26.780 --> 06:31.660]  It won't take that long to turn them around and they'll also grow quite large while they're in that early phase of flower
[06:31.660 --> 06:32.940]  They'll really take off for you
[06:32.940 --> 06:36.180]  So you can identify sex that way and then as soon as you find the males
[06:36.460 --> 06:38.220]  Remove them from the garden now
[06:38.220 --> 06:42.940]  We are only working with female plants be very careful that you do not put male plants
[06:42.940 --> 06:48.100]  Outdoors in the grow and the outdoor grow this season. We don't want to pollinate other people's grows
[06:48.140 --> 06:53.100]  We don't need stray pollen around I recommend to you do not put a male plant outdoors
[06:53.100 --> 06:57.700]  The way to do that is to sex it early identify that before they ever make it outdoors
[06:57.700 --> 07:00.340]  Those male plants should not ever go outdoors
[07:00.340 --> 07:01.020]  imagine
[07:01.020 --> 07:03.100]  Vegging a plant for two three
[07:03.100 --> 07:09.860]  Even four months getting that plant the size of a Volkswagen and then flowering it outdoors and 10 or 12 days into the flowering season
[07:09.860 --> 07:17.060]  You realize that big-ass plant that you dedicated all that time that energy that space the love the care the nutrients the water
[07:17.380 --> 07:18.980]  the real estate
[07:18.980 --> 07:24.460]  Possibly the felony you dedicated all of that to a plant that you don't even get to finish because it's a boy and you've got
[07:24.460 --> 07:26.460]  to cut it down as soon as
[07:26.700 --> 07:29.740]  Possible. So let's sex these plants before we put them outside
[07:29.740 --> 07:34.700]  That's why I'm telling you to order seeds now and grow them indoors one time if you can
[07:34.700 --> 07:36.700]  I understand not everybody's got that luxury
[07:36.740 --> 07:42.100]  But ideally let's run them one time indoors find out which plant in that batch is your favorite
[07:42.100 --> 07:43.180]  You've taken a clone of it
[07:43.180 --> 07:46.900]  So now you've got a mother plant of all of the plants in there when you find your favorite
[07:46.900 --> 07:52.460]  You can remove the rest keep your favorite make it bigger make multiple clones of that then put all of those clones outdoors
[07:52.460 --> 07:57.340]  So you've got your ideal phenotype loading up your outdoor garden now, like I've said before
[07:57.340 --> 08:02.580]  I understand that not everybody has got an indoor grow space. This is not optional for everybody
[08:02.580 --> 08:08.380]  This is just situational availability. If you can do this do this. If not, I do have other options for you
[08:08.380 --> 08:12.940]  I highly recommend if you can't sex your plants before you put them outside. I recommend
[08:13.380 --> 08:17.100]  Feminized seeds. That's right. Those plants will be all female seeds
[08:17.220 --> 08:21.580]  There's no difference in those fem seeds and reg seeds other than they will all be
[08:21.620 --> 08:26.820]  Females a lot of people have a lot of stigma a lot of myth a lot of problems with feminized seeds
[08:26.820 --> 08:32.900]  I'm here to tell you there's no difference in fem seeds than there are regular seeds other than the fact that we have learned how
[08:32.900 --> 08:37.100]  To remove all of the male pollen from the equation. It'll be all girl plants
[08:37.100 --> 08:43.760]  They will perform just as well as your male plant or your regular plants. They will you can clone them. You can breed with them
[08:43.760 --> 08:45.020]  They are just as good
[08:45.020 --> 08:51.420]  They are the exact same as the regular plants except we've learned how to not get the male pollen in that equation
[08:51.420 --> 08:55.900]  So they will all be female. So I recommend you run female plants outdoors
[08:55.900 --> 09:02.620]  I currently have lemon Jeffrey and golden goat fem seeds and very soon. I will restock the orange chasm fem seeds
[09:02.620 --> 09:05.060]  So if you're looking for quality fems in your garden
[09:05.060 --> 09:08.140]  Make sure you do look for lemon Jeffrey look for the golden goat
[09:08.140 --> 09:13.100]  And if you are kind of patient look out very soon for those orange chasm seeds, that's right
[09:13.100 --> 09:17.760]  We said it here first on the podcast. The orange chasm restock is coming very soon
[09:17.780 --> 09:18.420]  All right
[09:18.420 --> 09:22.020]  Where were we run fem seeds if you can if you can't sex your plants
[09:22.220 --> 09:24.980]  Indoors and do a pre sex test before you put them outside
[09:25.420 --> 09:29.900]  Then I would recommend running feminized seeds. All of those seeds will be girls
[09:29.900 --> 09:35.880]  You won't have to worry about pulling the males set yourself up for success. Now. Here is a crazy idea something
[09:35.880 --> 09:41.840]  I don't talk about too often, but if you want to be creative you can definitely run some auto flowers outdoors
[09:42.100 --> 09:48.560]  We have friends who have been on the podcast who run multiple crops of auto flowers outdoors. They will start a crop early
[09:48.560 --> 09:53.200]  They'll put it outside. They'll wait two or three weeks use the rest of the grown put that outside
[09:53.200 --> 09:54.800]  And that way they've got two crops
[09:54.800 --> 10:00.080]  Maybe even three crops of auto flowers coming down in the season that we get to grow one crop
[10:00.120 --> 10:03.560]  This works out very well for them because then they've got staggered harvest
[10:03.560 --> 10:04.880]  That means it in two weeks
[10:04.880 --> 10:09.000]  They get to cut down this little plot and then they get to process all that chop it down
[10:09.400 --> 10:14.040]  Trim it do whatever needs to be done processing is the word get it out of the way then in two weeks
[10:14.040 --> 10:20.080]  We've got another crop coming then in two weeks another crop that helps out because then you don't have one giant crop to cut down
[10:20.080 --> 10:23.360]  All at once it'll buy you some time space out your harvest
[10:23.360 --> 10:28.520]  Also, I've seen people run one auto flower crop outside and one photo period crop outside
[10:28.520 --> 10:33.620]  You get to cut down those autos a little bit early then right after that your photo period crop is done
[10:33.620 --> 10:39.320]  I've seen that so think about what is going to work best for you in your environment in your situation
[10:39.320 --> 10:40.560]  Do you want regular seeds?
[10:40.600 --> 10:45.280]  Do you need fem seeds or are you the type of person that is going to run auto flowers now?
[10:45.280 --> 10:47.240]  There's also the other option of getting clones
[10:47.240 --> 10:52.120]  Are you going to get clones from a friend from a dispensary somewhere online a clone vendor?
[10:52.120 --> 10:53.560]  Maybe they fall out of the sky
[10:53.560 --> 10:55.500]  I don't know allegedly how you get your clones
[10:55.500 --> 10:58.400]  But here are things to think about when you get those clones
[10:58.520 --> 11:02.840]  Make sure you treat them for every bug and pathogen and pest and mold
[11:03.360 --> 11:10.160]  Possible think that those bug those plants have got every plant disease you could imagine and treat them for it isolate them
[11:10.160 --> 11:13.440]  Don't put them near the rest of your plants clean them up
[11:13.440 --> 11:18.240]  And then the thing to think about is when you get clones is that clone first of all?
[11:18.240 --> 11:20.080]  Is it really what you think it is?
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.640]  Is it legitimately properly labeled then the second thing to think about is somebody else?
[11:24.920 --> 11:28.160]  Pheno hunted that clone for you now that may be great for you
[11:28.160 --> 11:34.720]  But I like different things than you like and Mike likes different things than I like and Clint likes different things than Mike likes
[11:34.720 --> 11:39.200]  And but we all like similar things, but I don't want to rely on another person to pheno hunt
[11:39.280 --> 11:42.720]  My outdoor product for me. That's something that I would like to do myself
[11:42.720 --> 11:45.960]  So unless you really trust the person that did that selection for you
[11:45.960 --> 11:51.600]  You may not get the ideal phenotype that you're hoping for it may be great for them in their region in their environment
[11:51.720 --> 11:54.400]  and their state and their climate and their garden in their
[11:55.040 --> 11:59.880]  Situation everything will be different just a few miles away things are going to be drastically different
[11:59.880 --> 12:05.160]  So maybe that phenotype was perfect for them, but it's not going to be perfect for you. That is something to think about
[12:05.280 --> 12:09.920]  All right, let's move forward a little bit I've been talking about the right plant for you
[12:10.440 --> 12:15.200]  Think about selecting the right plants for your region things to think about as well
[12:15.200 --> 12:18.800]  It finish on time. Is it too hot or too cold in your environment?
[12:18.800 --> 12:21.560]  Is it too dry or too humid in your environment?
[12:21.640 --> 12:26.280]  Does your environment have does it commonly get powdery mildew in your environment?
[12:26.280 --> 12:31.440]  Have you grown outdoors the last couple of years? Do you know people who have grown outdoors in your region in the last few years?
[12:31.760 --> 12:37.960]  What did they experience what problems past past the pathogens did they experience do they get powdery mildew?
[12:37.960 --> 12:43.200]  Did they get a certain kind of bug at a certain time of the year if you talk to the farmers in your area?
[12:43.200 --> 12:45.640]  They will already know what you need to prepare for
[12:45.880 --> 12:51.960]  So maybe find the other ganja farmers in your area join the groups join the community and find out what is coming
[12:52.040 --> 12:58.520]  Also talk to the other farmers the people that are just growing normal conventional crops the lettuce farmers the carrot farmers
[12:58.520 --> 13:03.120]  I don't know what they're growing in your neighborhood, but talk to them and see what should I expect this year?
[13:03.120 --> 13:06.880]  They will let you know now is the time to start researching and selecting plants
[13:06.880 --> 13:11.040]  They're going to handle those conditions those problems and that environment properly
[13:11.040 --> 13:15.560]  You will see on some breeders websites that they do say these plants handle powdery mildew
[13:15.560 --> 13:18.740]  These plants are great in this region. These plants are great in this region
[13:18.740 --> 13:22.480]  You will see things like that on my website and many other breeders websites
[13:22.520 --> 13:27.520]  So start doing your research also go see what other growers in your area are growing
[13:27.520 --> 13:28.720]  Maybe you need the same strains
[13:28.720 --> 13:34.000]  Maybe there's a reason why everybody in that area chooses that same clone because it does very well there
[13:34.040 --> 13:40.680]  There's probably a breeder in your area that is producing seeds that has been producing seeds for generations after generation
[13:40.960 --> 13:44.600]  In that area to make the perfect strain for that area
[13:44.600 --> 13:48.520]  So maybe you need to find the breeder in your area that's got the crop for you
[13:48.520 --> 13:53.040]  I know that the things I breed here work very well here. Of course, they're being bred here
[13:53.040 --> 13:55.920]  So if I spread them out to my friends grows here, we have great success
[13:55.920 --> 14:03.440]  There's probably somebody like that in your area now. Here's something I always want to talk about when it comes to planning outdoors
[14:04.040 --> 14:08.200]  First of all, I should say follow the rules follow the laws if you're gonna plan outdoors
[14:08.560 --> 14:10.640]  Know how many plants you can put out there?
[14:10.640 --> 14:15.760]  Know if they've got to be under lock and key behind a fence if they've got to be hidden that is up to you
[14:15.760 --> 14:19.980]  I'm not your legal counsel. I am the guy teaching you how to produce high quality cannabis
[14:19.980 --> 14:25.900]  Do not get yourself or me in trouble while you were doing that now that being said follow your plan
[14:25.920 --> 14:29.240]  Count follow all the rules, but always plant extra
[14:29.720 --> 14:35.200]  You're gonna lose some you're definitely most likely probably going to lose some of your outdoor crop
[14:35.200 --> 14:39.920]  You're going to lose some to weather you're going to lose some to bugs. You're going to lose some to animals
[14:40.320 --> 14:47.200]  There are also thieves and then maybe even law enforcement and then hopefully after all of that at the bottom of the list
[14:47.200 --> 14:52.880]  Maybe you're on the list and you'll get some cannabis at the end of this for yourself, but make sure you plant extra
[14:53.440 --> 14:54.520]  because
[14:54.800 --> 14:57.360]  Here where we are we always lose a couple of plants
[14:57.360 --> 15:00.000]  I had a friend who had a big outdoor grow in his backyard and
[15:00.120 --> 15:04.040]  Every year the plant right there at the corner and that plant right there at the back corner
[15:04.040 --> 15:08.040]  Those would be the first two to disappear and when those started getting cut down by the thieves
[15:08.040 --> 15:12.160]  We knew that was when it was time for us to get out there and actually start harvesting our crop
[15:12.160 --> 15:17.200]  So I've had plants stolen from my backyards before that's why I don't even bother to grow outdoor cannabis here
[15:17.480 --> 15:21.920]  My neighbors are 20 feet that way and 20 feet that way and probably 40 feet that way
[15:22.120 --> 15:26.200]  They can all see it the fences are real low it's gonna disappear around here
[15:26.200 --> 15:28.160]  So there's no point in growing outdoor cannabis here
[15:28.160 --> 15:35.440]  The thieves are gonna come get it but make sure that you plant extra because like I said bugs animals weather thieves
[15:35.760 --> 15:37.000]  cops
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.940]  Who knows what else could go wrong? There could be a great flood. I don't even want to wish
[15:41.940 --> 15:46.880]  I don't want to jinx you and send other shit your way but plant extra and plan ahead
[15:47.360 --> 15:50.960]  Outdoor can be as simple or as elaborate as you want to make it
[15:50.960 --> 15:56.080]  It could be as easy as putting some pots outdoors or you could really prep the soil build a bunch of structure
[15:56.080 --> 15:58.280]  Build a watering system. It is up to you
[15:58.280 --> 16:02.680]  The beauty of it is that Sun is so amazing that Sun is free and it is out there
[16:02.680 --> 16:07.960]  So you should take advantage of that if you've got the space and the legal means to do so
[16:08.160 --> 16:10.560]  It's all about how much effort you want to spend into it
[16:10.560 --> 16:14.880]  But the first things I would think about definitely are good genetics
[16:14.880 --> 16:18.960]  If you don't have good genetics for outdoors or not go you may not even make it all the way to harvest or
[16:19.560 --> 16:22.440]  Harvest time may come and your plants might not even be finished. It may be
[16:22.960 --> 16:27.920]  Snowing on you maybe Halloween here in Colorado. It snows almost every year on Halloween
[16:27.920 --> 16:32.600]  The joke is that you've got to base your Halloween costume around your jacket and around the snow
[16:32.600 --> 16:36.320]  So I rock the Chewbacca costume. It's always nice and warm, but it's going to snow
[16:36.320 --> 16:41.680]  Maybe your plants won't even be done by then if you have not selected the appropriate genetics
[16:41.680 --> 16:43.680]  So choose the right genetics
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.040]  Then the next thing I would think about is probably amending the soil
[16:47.360 --> 16:52.080]  The soil is where the plants are going to get their energy their life their food their nutrients
[16:52.080 --> 16:55.680]  That's coming from the soil unless you plan on feeding your outdoor crop bottled nutrients
[16:55.680 --> 17:01.680]  I would really invest in amending the soil good soil. I've done several podcasts with Jesse
[17:01.680 --> 17:07.040]  I've done a lot of other outdoor episodes and also follow build a soil if you really want to know about building a good outdoor
[17:07.040 --> 17:12.320]  And getting your products affordably and getting them shipped right to your door build a soil does not pay me anything for that
[17:12.320 --> 17:15.280]  I just know it's a great company and they've got all the shit that you're gonna need
[17:15.680 --> 17:18.880]  So build a good soil get that outdoor soil going then something else
[17:18.880 --> 17:25.600]  I would definitely consider is something to cover your outdoor plants from storms here in Colorado
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.480]  We get a hailstorm right in the middle of the summer
[17:28.720 --> 17:30.160]  It's gonna be a super nice day
[17:30.160 --> 17:32.960]  And then you're gonna look up and it's gonna be dark as shit up in the sky
[17:32.960 --> 17:36.160]  The clouds are gonna be all rolling around and look crazy and you're gonna see lightning
[17:36.400 --> 17:40.480]  In about 40 seconds after that there's gonna be hail the size of golf balls and grapefruits
[17:40.720 --> 17:44.800]  Get the fuck indoors cover your car get your car in the garage bring the dog inside
[17:44.800 --> 17:49.040]  But now what about the ganja plants now is the time before we put those plants outdoors?
[17:49.200 --> 17:54.640]  To start thinking about that hailstorm the rainstorm the crazy winds we're going to get I don't know what comes your way
[17:54.640 --> 17:56.320]  I don't know where you are
[17:56.320 --> 17:58.320]  But you're gonna get some bullshit weather
[17:58.400 --> 18:02.800]  It's their plants are gonna be out there June July August September maybe October
[18:03.360 --> 18:06.480]  Maybe even into later than that if you depending on what you're gonna do
[18:06.640 --> 18:08.720]  They're gonna be out there for five six months
[18:08.720 --> 18:14.960]  You're going to get at least one two, maybe five or six terrible fucking nights of weather be prepared for that
[18:14.960 --> 18:20.400]  Let's build something to cover these plants from the hail. Let's build something to protect them from the rain
[18:20.560 --> 18:22.880]  Let's build a way to protect them from the crazy winds
[18:22.880 --> 18:25.200]  Let's build a way to protect them from the crazy winds
[18:25.200 --> 18:30.960]  Let's build a way to protect them from the crazy winds that do come up be prepared and expect that don't act surprised
[18:30.960 --> 18:34.720]  When it fucking hails on you it is going to happen. That's what nature does
[18:35.280 --> 18:39.360]  Especially when we all put a bunch of ganja plants outside nature goes you think so motherfucker
[18:40.080 --> 18:42.960]  And it just drops all the ice trays right on your head and laughs at you
[18:42.960 --> 18:48.640]  That's the way nature works. So be prepared plan ahead. Like I said before set yourself up for success
[18:48.640 --> 18:53.040]  We all know the storm is coming. We know that the animals are coming. We know the bugs are coming
[18:53.280 --> 18:56.000]  We know the bugs are coming. We know the weather is coming
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.080]  We know that a thief is going to think about it be prepared for all of this shit you guys
[19:00.160 --> 19:03.440]  So I would focus on getting good genetics then I would amend that soil
[19:03.600 --> 19:09.600]  Then I would definitely work on something to cover and protect those plants. It happens every year. It ruins people's crops
[19:09.680 --> 19:14.480]  I've seen people lose entire summers worth of work in one night due to a hailstorm
[19:14.560 --> 19:21.860]  So be prepared for that another thing that you should definitely think about in your outdoor garden and planning your outdoor garden early is integrated
[19:22.340 --> 19:26.500]  Pest management. What are you going to do to keep bugs away from your garden?
[19:26.740 --> 19:32.500]  What is going to show up in your area? We all run the risk of uh spider mites white flies fungus gnats
[19:32.740 --> 19:37.940]  Uh here in colorado in my region. We get a lot of caterpillars that turn into beetles or they turn into uh,
[19:38.560 --> 19:41.940]  Caterpillars, they turn into these little moths they turn and they lay these uh weird
[19:42.260 --> 19:45.860]  Uh cocoons inside of the buds and then they break open and they have these little orange
[19:46.020 --> 19:48.100]  Uh that are melon worms or something
[19:48.100 --> 19:52.260]  They turn into these orange fucking worms and they eat your weed and then if you smoke those orange worms
[19:52.260 --> 19:55.060]  You get high as giraffe pussy, but I haven't done that since like high school
[19:55.060 --> 20:00.020]  So don't do that shit anymore. But think about your integrated pest management strategy. Not only insects
[20:00.260 --> 20:05.620]  Are you going to get rabbits? Are you going to get deer? Is there a possibility of bear? Maybe there's dogs
[20:05.700 --> 20:11.300]  Maybe there's cats think about all of that shit and how to humanely keep them away from the grow
[20:11.620 --> 20:12.580]  Let's not hurt
[20:12.580 --> 20:15.700]  Uh any of the animals the bugs the natural life that was there
[20:16.180 --> 20:21.060]  That land that was there was there before you it is yours now to grow on but in the future
[20:21.140 --> 20:25.860]  I don't know whose it will be. So please take good care of that land for the future generations
[20:25.940 --> 20:31.140]  Maybe you've got kids. Maybe you don't somebody's gonna have to deal with that land in the future. Please don't fuck it up
[20:31.460 --> 20:35.720]  Also something else I should mention when we're using our pesticides or integrated pest management
[20:36.100 --> 20:41.940]  Uh, keep your neighbors in mind. Let's not destroy or damage or ruin their side of the fence. Keep that shit in mind
[20:42.260 --> 20:45.700]  Let's not destroy any of the nature around us. Let's uh, let's improve it
[20:45.780 --> 20:47.860]  I know we have to get rid of some bugs. We have to be safe
[20:47.860 --> 20:52.580]  We have to protect our crop but be respectful to the environment that is around you
[20:52.820 --> 21:00.660]  So with that being said find an ideal humane way to keep rabbits chickens dogs cats goats deer bear
[21:00.900 --> 21:06.260]  I don't know what is in your neighborhood. Maybe there's a crazy possum. Maybe you got spider monkeys. I don't know what is there but
[21:06.980 --> 21:12.340]  Figure out a way to safely and humanely keep them away from your plants also think about thieves
[21:12.740 --> 21:14.740]  We need to keep thieves away from our plants
[21:14.900 --> 21:17.620]  I would never recommend hurting anybody for your ganja plants
[21:17.620 --> 21:21.460]  You will go to jail if you hurt somebody protecting your ganja plants depending on what state you're in
[21:22.020 --> 21:26.340]  You could very well go to jail for defending your criminal enterprise, which is your ganja plant
[21:26.580 --> 21:31.300]  So think about what you're going to do if somebody comes into that yard one night to take your plants also keep in mind
[21:31.780 --> 21:37.140]  You've got bait out there you were never entering a criminal enterprise or this sort of realm before but now you've got a very
[21:37.680 --> 21:43.780]  Profitable a cash crop a very valuable commodity in your backyard and people may want that think about that before you enter
[21:44.260 --> 21:49.300]  This endeavor here before you even put those plants out there. Also i've said this before
[21:49.940 --> 21:55.540]  It is my responsibility as just a good friend and as a podcaster to remind you think about law enforcement
[21:55.540 --> 21:57.540]  Is it legal to grow where you're growing?
[21:57.860 --> 22:03.220]  If it's not legal to grow where you're growing are you ready to face those consequences which whatever may happen
[22:03.460 --> 22:06.020]  Whatever may come from it now, you're gonna say no one's gonna know
[22:06.500 --> 22:08.740]  How are they gonna know shit happens, dude?
[22:08.740 --> 22:15.300]  Maybe uh recently my basement flooded and I had to have plumbers and fucking people down in my basement near where my grow space is
[22:15.380 --> 22:18.580]  Luckily, it's legal here in colorado. I've only got a few fucking plants
[22:19.060 --> 22:22.580]  I just straight up showed them because it was easier to be like hey, here's this in here
[22:22.660 --> 22:26.340]  Please don't go in this room and they all looked and they said oh there's plants and it was out of the way
[22:26.340 --> 22:28.340]  I just showed them, you know, I mean here just lift up my dress
[22:28.580 --> 22:33.140]  Let me let you take a peek that way they weren't curious, but i've got my legal amount of plants down there
[22:33.140 --> 22:37.620]  It's nothing crazy. They went. Oh, they were bored with it, but maybe it's not legal where you are
[22:37.620 --> 22:43.060]  So maybe one day the gas guy comes to check the gas meter or the water meter or the electrical meter
[22:43.220 --> 22:47.220]  Or maybe there's a fucking cop helicopter just happens to randomly fly over your backyard
[22:47.540 --> 22:52.180]  Maybe your neighbors get in a fight and then the cops go to the neighbor's house and they're in the backyard just talking
[22:52.340 --> 22:53.540]  And they go what's that over the fence?
[22:53.540 --> 22:56.820]  So it's a big-ass weed plant think about all of the shit that could go wrong
[22:57.060 --> 22:58.580]  I don't want anything to go wrong for you
[22:58.580 --> 23:01.540]  But I want you to be prepared for it because shit has gone wrong for me
[23:01.860 --> 23:06.820]  And I wish that somebody would have warned me the bullshit that I could have gotten myself into so i'm just being a bro
[23:06.980 --> 23:10.100]  Trying to help you out think about it if it's not completely legal where you are
[23:10.660 --> 23:14.100]  Weigh your options, uh legally probably I should say don't fucking do it
[23:14.180 --> 23:18.020]  But you're a grown-ass adult and I recommend that every grown adult does what the fuck they want
[23:18.100 --> 23:21.460]  Don't be governed by rasta jeff or the government if that's how you feel
[23:21.700 --> 23:22.500]  All right
[23:22.500 --> 23:29.460]  Let me get myself back on track here, uh integrated pest management plan for every bug imaginable plan for every pest animal
[23:29.700 --> 23:35.060]  Uh problem pathogen imaginable then also prepare for thieves and prepare for law enforcement
[23:35.300 --> 23:37.060]  However, you want to deal with them is up to you
[23:37.060 --> 23:39.700]  I should also say that booby traps are highly illegal
[23:39.940 --> 23:45.220]  If you set up some sort of booby traps in your grow in your yard in your space and somebody else gets hurt
[23:45.380 --> 23:49.220]  Especially a law enforcement officer you are in deep shit. You're going to get sued
[23:49.220 --> 23:52.420]  You're going to go to jail if you own the property you're in extra trouble
[23:52.500 --> 23:56.340]  If you're just a renter the homeowner may also be in some trouble with you
[23:56.420 --> 23:56.740]  All right
[23:56.740 --> 23:57.060]  All right
[23:57.060 --> 24:03.060]  I feel like i've rambled enough about your early outdoor grow preparations if you have any questions corrections comments or concerns

[26:23.340 --> 26:30.380]  I will read those questions here on the podcast. I love answering the listener questions and creating listener generated content
[26:30.460 --> 26:35.900]  So, please do send in those grow questions. All right, I feel like my voice is burning out. My throat's getting dry
[26:36.060 --> 26:40.380]  It's time to go get a drink and take some dabs. I'll be back in a week with fresh new content
[26:40.540 --> 26:45.340]  I want to give a big shout out to my friends at custom dank and until next time take a fat dab
[26:45.820 --> 26:47.820]  And give your mom a hug for me
