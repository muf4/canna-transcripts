[00:56.520 --> 01:00.520]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:00.520 --> 01:03.520]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Honeysuckle Live Batter.
[01:03.520 --> 01:06.520]  This is a blend of lemon essence and Han Solo Burger.
[01:06.520 --> 01:11.520]  On the package, the flavor is described as honey, sweet lemons, and floral.
[01:11.520 --> 01:17.520]  I took a dab of it before I read the package, and I described the flavor as sweet and tropical.
[01:17.520 --> 01:22.520]  I said it was almost like somebody took a lei from Hawaii and put it in the dabber, and I really enjoyed it.
[01:22.520 --> 01:29.520]  I found the flavor delightful. I found the buzz to be perfect, and I really like the Honeysuckle Live Batter.
[01:29.520 --> 01:36.520]  On the back of the package, it says it contains 67.22% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[01:36.520 --> 01:40.520]  Big shout-out to the Honeysuckle Live Batter.
[01:40.520 --> 01:46.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers and grovers, clone cutters and pollen chuckers.
[01:46.520 --> 01:51.520]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of emails. I'm also going to read a couple of Patreon messages.
[01:51.520 --> 02:00.520]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout-outs to a few of the folks who support the show on the Patreon at the $7.10 a month level or higher.
[02:00.520 --> 02:04.520]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast. Thank you. Shout-out to Karen Crawford.
[02:04.520 --> 02:09.520]  Let's follow that up with a big thank you shout-out to Terp Burglar. I love the name, bro.
[02:09.520 --> 02:12.520]  Let's follow that one up with a big fist bump and a thank you shout-out to The BAFSTA.
[02:12.520 --> 02:16.520]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout-out to Fat Rabbit.
[02:16.520 --> 02:20.520]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Lefty. Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Homie D.
[02:20.520 --> 02:25.520]  I've got a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout-out and a high-five to our friend Mike M.
[02:25.520 --> 02:28.520]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart thank you shout-out to Grow Man Stan.
[02:28.520 --> 02:30.520]  I want to say thank you to Grant M.
[02:30.520 --> 02:38.520]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout-out to my friend Kurt Z.
[02:38.520 --> 02:42.520]  Big thank you and big shout-out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[02:42.520 --> 02:45.520]  If you're not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[02:45.520 --> 02:52.520]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[02:52.520 --> 02:55.520]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:55.520 --> 03:02.520]  And of course, I did include the link in the show notes and the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[03:02.520 --> 03:07.520]  All right, the next part on the list is I owe a big thank you to a few other people.
[03:07.520 --> 03:13.520]  In the previous episode, I read a message from a disabled veteran who was asking about advice for a grow light.
[03:13.520 --> 03:16.520]  I didn't think that their budget was going to get them a quality light.
[03:16.520 --> 03:20.520]  So I asked my audience for a little bit of guidance and possibly some help.
[03:20.520 --> 03:24.520]  And the response was overwhelming. Thank you.
[03:24.520 --> 03:27.520]  This listener that asked for help is going to get a grow light.
[03:27.520 --> 03:33.520]  And a few more of my listeners are going to get grow lights because we had some very generous people reach out to me.
[03:33.520 --> 03:39.520]  By the time this episode comes out, I will be in the works of putting people in touch to get grow lights shipped to the appropriate people
[03:39.520 --> 03:45.520]  so we can get some disabled veterans and some people in need growing quality medicine.
[03:45.520 --> 03:48.520]  I don't think the people that helped me and contributed wanted a shout out.
[03:48.520 --> 03:51.520]  That's not why they did it. They did it because they're kind people.
[03:51.520 --> 03:54.520]  I'm not going to say any names. You know who you are.
[03:54.520 --> 03:57.520]  If you would like a shout out on my show, send me a message. I will highlight you.
[03:57.520 --> 04:00.520]  I will say thank you, but thank you. I appreciate it.
[04:00.520 --> 04:04.520]  Our friends who are going to get grow lights, they appreciate the help. Thank you.
[04:04.520 --> 04:06.520]  You've got a great heart. It means a lot to me.
[04:06.520 --> 04:10.520]  It was really overwhelming to see what my little show here could do.
[04:10.520 --> 04:14.520]  I said, hey, ladies and gentlemen, there's a disabled veteran in need.
[04:14.520 --> 04:16.520]  Can I have some advice or possibly a grow light?
[04:16.520 --> 04:19.520]  And people just reached out. They're like, here's advice and here's grow lights.
[04:19.520 --> 04:21.520]  Just take them and put them where you need them.
[04:21.520 --> 04:25.520]  That means a lot to me. That also means a lot to the people who are getting the grow lights.
[04:25.520 --> 04:29.520]  So thank you. Shout out. Fist bump. I appreciate you. I really do.
[04:29.520 --> 04:31.520]  Thanks a lot. All right. Let's keep moving.
[04:31.520 --> 04:34.520]  I do have a couple of messages I'd really like to get to on the show.
[04:34.520 --> 04:40.520]  With no further ado, the first message on today's episode goes just like this.
[04:40.520 --> 04:42.520]  What's up, Rasta Jeff? My name is, I'm going to skip the name.
[04:42.520 --> 04:46.520]  It says, I go by Grizzly Grower. You can use my name if you would like to.
[04:46.520 --> 04:49.520]  What up, Kent? This one comes from Kent, the Grizzly Grower.
[04:49.520 --> 04:55.520]  It says, I just wanted to let you know I am super stoked to be a contributing member of the Irie Army.
[04:55.520 --> 04:58.520]  I've been a weed nerd and I followed Subcool for quite some time.
[04:58.520 --> 05:05.520]  But with his passing, I was left lost. I am always going to consider myself a weed nerd.
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.520]  That means we are in the same club. We are both big followers and supporters of Subcool.
[05:09.520 --> 05:12.520]  We are both in the Irie Army. I may be the leader.
[05:12.520 --> 05:18.520]  I think I may have designated Lemur Priest as the leader of the Irie Army, the captain and commander.
[05:18.520 --> 05:21.520]  But we are Irie Army together. Gang, gang.
[05:21.520 --> 05:27.520]  When Subcool passed, I did feel sort of an absence, a gap in the cannabis community.
[05:27.520 --> 05:29.520]  I'm going to keep reading the message before I get rambling.
[05:29.520 --> 05:35.520]  It says, with Subcool's passing, I felt lost. But I found you and I'm so glad I did, bro.
[05:35.520 --> 05:37.520]  I'm so glad you found me as well.
[05:37.520 --> 05:42.520]  It says, I'm so appreciative of your knowledge, of your willingness to teach and spread love.
[05:42.520 --> 05:47.520]  I really dig your style and your techniques and your breeding style is on point, bro.
[05:47.520 --> 05:51.520]  This message does go on. There's more, but I think more of it is for me to read.
[05:51.520 --> 05:56.520]  It's more private to myself. The part I wanted to touch on is the Subcool part.
[05:56.520 --> 05:59.520]  Thank you, first of all, for the compliments. I'm glad you found me.
[05:59.520 --> 06:05.520]  When Subcool passed, I did feel a void. There was an opening. There was something that had to be done.
[06:05.520 --> 06:11.520]  Subcool, love him or hate him, Subcool was a great teacher. He was a speaker. He was outspoken.
[06:11.520 --> 06:15.520]  He liked to interact with his people, his followers, whatever you call them.
[06:15.520 --> 06:20.520]  The TGA, Team Green Avengers, he interacted with the weed nerds quite a bit.
[06:20.520 --> 06:25.520]  I enjoyed that. I learned a lot from him. Without Subcool, I wouldn't be where I am today.
[06:25.520 --> 06:31.520]  If you love Sub, if you hate Sub, I am partly his fault. He's partly my fault. No, I think I'm his fault.
[06:31.520 --> 06:34.520]  He created this monster. He is part of what created this monster.
[06:34.520 --> 06:38.520]  Without Subby, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have a seed company. I wouldn't have a podcast.
[06:38.520 --> 06:43.520]  Things would be much different for both of us without Subcool. Big shout out to Subcool.
[06:43.520 --> 06:49.520]  I think what I'm getting at is when Subcool passed, I knew there was a void.
[06:49.520 --> 06:56.520]  I knew there was a gap that needed to be filled. I think I slowly, accidentally took it upon myself to fill that Subcool gap.
[06:56.520 --> 07:02.520]  Somebody's got to be teaching people. Somebody's got to be reading emails and giving solutions and helping shit out.
[07:02.520 --> 07:06.520]  I thought that would be me. I've stepped up my game a little bit since Subcool is gone.
[07:06.520 --> 07:12.520]  I do more shows. I try to do more live shows. I go on more things. I answer more emails.
[07:12.520 --> 07:15.520]  I try. I've tried to step up and fill the space that Subcool left.
[07:16.520 --> 07:20.520]  I feel like in a way, the torch has been passed. I was the generation after Subcool.
[07:20.520 --> 07:24.520]  Subcool didn't physically reach down and go, Rasta Jeff, it's your turn.
[07:24.520 --> 07:32.520]  But in many ways, that torch was passed to me. I know that it's my responsibility to carry on that Subcool thing that he was doing.
[07:32.520 --> 07:40.520]  In several ways, I'm doing it here on social media, here on YouTube, here on Apple Podcasts, through podcasting, through social media.
[07:40.520 --> 07:44.520]  I'm getting the Subcool vibe and things carrying on through me.
[07:44.520 --> 07:47.520]  It's my own thing, but a lot of it is for and from Sub.
[07:47.520 --> 07:53.520]  Another thing I'm doing, have done, is I crossed a bunch of my stuff to a Subcool Jack the Ripper male.
[07:53.520 --> 07:56.520]  I've got a Jack the Ripper male that is just a fucking stud.
[07:56.520 --> 08:00.520]  I've pollinated several of my Irie Genetics Elite cuts with that plant.
[08:00.520 --> 08:04.520]  So I've crossed the Irie Genetics with the Subcool seeds.
[08:04.520 --> 08:08.520]  That's one thing I can do to honor Subcool. I made Jack the Ripper F2s.
[08:08.520 --> 08:11.520]  That'll keep Subcool's memory and honor alive.
[08:11.520 --> 08:16.520]  I've been growing in people's gardens long after we're both gone, so that's going to be something I can do for Sub.
[08:16.520 --> 08:19.520]  Man, I got just rambly a lot here.
[08:19.520 --> 08:24.520]  Also, I owe a shout out to somebody. Recently, I acquired a Chernobyl clone, a plant.
[08:24.520 --> 08:27.520]  It's not even a clone. It's a fucking small plant, and it is gorgeous.
[08:27.520 --> 08:31.520]  If you contributed that Chernobyl to the garden, thank you. That will be put to great use.
[08:31.520 --> 08:35.520]  It will be bred, too. There's already a strain name in mind. I already know what I'm going to create with that.
[08:35.520 --> 08:37.520]  You guys are going to love it.
[08:38.520 --> 08:41.520]  Thank you for mentioning Subcool. Subcool has been coming up a lot lately.
[08:41.520 --> 08:45.520]  It was recently Subcool's birthday. His passing has been on my mind for some reason lately.
[08:45.520 --> 08:48.520]  It was great to read this message about Subcool. Thank you.
[08:48.520 --> 08:52.520]  Thank you for the compliments, and thank you for—you didn't compare me to Subby,
[08:52.520 --> 08:55.520]  but you kind of put me right up there with Sub, who was one of my many heroes.
[08:55.520 --> 08:59.520]  So thank you. Long live Subcool. Rest in peace, Subcool.
[08:59.520 --> 09:03.520]  I'm doing what I can with the torch I've been passed. Thanks for letting me ramble about it.
[09:03.520 --> 09:07.520]  Big shout-out to our friend Kent, the Grizzly Grower 13.
[09:07.520 --> 09:11.520]  All right. I'm going to keep moving because I do have a few messages I want to get through.
[09:11.520 --> 09:15.520]  This one comes from our friend Kojax. This one came from Patreon.
[09:15.520 --> 09:18.520]  Once again, patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[09:18.520 --> 09:24.520]  It goes, hey, Rasta Jeff. I don't know if you wrote it like that, but I read it like that.
[09:24.520 --> 09:26.520]  It goes, thank you for everything you were doing.
[09:26.520 --> 09:31.520]  You've helped me a ton, and keep helping me every time you drop a new episode.
[09:31.520 --> 09:33.520]  Thank you. I appreciate that. You helped me out as well.
[09:33.520 --> 09:36.520]  It says, I wanted to pay my respects with a little cash.
[09:36.520 --> 09:40.520]  You've definitely saved me more than $10 a month. I love hearing that.
[09:40.520 --> 09:44.520]  I put out these episodes for free. It's supposed to be free to reach everybody.
[09:44.520 --> 09:49.520]  If somebody saves a couple of bucks in their garden, if you make a couple of extra bucks on my advice,
[09:49.520 --> 09:52.520]  feel free to hit me up on Patreon like our friend did here.
[09:52.520 --> 09:54.520]  I don't expect it. It is not required.
[09:54.520 --> 09:58.520]  But these types of things, like a little tip, like a little boost, like a little high five,
[09:58.520 --> 10:01.520]  that's like recharge for my soul. So thank you.
[10:01.520 --> 10:04.520]  Thank you, Kojax. I appreciate the 10 bucks.
[10:04.520 --> 10:08.520]  I know that is a lot of money for some people to pull out of their wallet every month.
[10:08.520 --> 10:12.520]  If you've got a family, if you don't have the best job on the planet, 10 bucks can fucking ruin your week.
[10:12.520 --> 10:15.520]  So thank you for helping me out. I do appreciate it.
[10:15.520 --> 10:19.520]  It goes on. There is more. It says, here is my situation.
[10:19.520 --> 10:27.520]  My mom had two types of cancer a few years back and lost a lot of feeling in her hands and her feet from the chemo.
[10:27.520 --> 10:30.520]  I hope she beat the cancer. It sounds like she may be over the cancer now.
[10:30.520 --> 10:34.520]  I hope that is going well. Keep fighting, mama. Stay strong.
[10:34.520 --> 10:37.520]  Let's all send some good vibes out to Kojax mama here.
[10:37.520 --> 10:40.520]  Bro, take a fat dab and really give your mom a hug for me.
[10:40.520 --> 10:48.520]  It goes on, though. It says, she loves CBD and tinctures, but they are insanely expensive in California.
[10:48.520 --> 10:51.520]  Yes, CBD, good quality CBD is expensive right now.
[10:51.520 --> 10:55.520]  Don't get that gas station shit. Don't get that China stuff.
[10:55.520 --> 10:58.520]  Get quality CBD products that you can rely on.
[10:58.520 --> 11:03.520]  It says, $50 for 15 milliliters is not uncommon.
[11:03.520 --> 11:07.520]  I want to try my hand at growing some CBD hybrids.
[11:07.520 --> 11:09.520]  Do you have any experience with CBD strains?
[11:09.520 --> 11:18.520]  If so, are there any differences between normal high THC plants when it comes to feeding, watering, training to really bring out more CBD?
[11:18.520 --> 11:22.520]  Any additional information would be greatly appreciated.
[11:22.520 --> 11:25.520]  Then there's a little note that's left here for myself. I'm going to make sure not to read that.
[11:25.520 --> 11:27.520]  This is a great question, Kojax. Thank you.
[11:27.520 --> 11:31.520]  I will be in touch about the private message part.
[11:31.520 --> 11:39.520]  The main question here is, our friend is attempting, wants to grow CBD-rich plants to help mama with her numbness in her hands and feet.
[11:39.520 --> 11:43.520]  Shout out to mom once again.
[11:43.520 --> 11:47.520]  Also, shout out to you for being a really good son and trying to take care of your mama. That's commendable.
[11:48.520 --> 11:55.520]  The main question is, are there any differences in growing CBD-rich plants compared to growing THC-rich plants?
[11:55.520 --> 11:57.520]  It's a really good question.
[11:57.520 --> 12:06.520]  In my experience, I did not notice much difference, if any difference at all, when growing CBD-dominant rich plants.
[12:06.520 --> 12:08.520]  I was working in a large commercial grow.
[12:08.520 --> 12:11.520]  We had nearly 1,000 plants in the flowering room.
[12:11.520 --> 12:14.520]  Most of those plants, we were aiming for that high THC stuff.
[12:14.520 --> 12:16.520]  We had Golden Goat, we had Lemon Jeffrey.
[12:16.520 --> 12:18.520]  What else was in there?
[12:18.520 --> 12:21.520]  The pineapple, the cactus cooler was in there.
[12:21.520 --> 12:24.520]  Just a bunch of stuff like that that would really hit the pineapple.
[12:24.520 --> 12:25.520]  Something was in there.
[12:25.520 --> 12:27.520]  A bunch of sativa stuff that would really pay.
[12:27.520 --> 12:29.520]  The Lemon G was in there all day.
[12:29.520 --> 12:30.520]  Stuff that would pay the bills.
[12:30.520 --> 12:32.520]  Sativa-dominant stuff that hit real hard.
[12:32.520 --> 12:36.520]  Also, we knew that we needed medicine in there for the CBD-desired people.
[12:36.520 --> 12:39.520]  We had some CBD crosses in there.
[12:39.520 --> 12:43.520]  If I remember correctly, in that grow, we had Harlequin in there.
[12:43.520 --> 12:45.520]  Also, we had ACDC in there.
[12:45.520 --> 12:48.520]  We also had a plant called Tora Bora in there.
[12:48.520 --> 12:50.520]  I'll talk a little bit about each of these plants now.
[12:51.520 --> 12:57.520]  Harlequin was a CBD-rich plant that grew like a sativa.
[12:57.520 --> 13:00.520]  It grew tall, it grew skinny, it had longer, slender leaves.
[13:00.520 --> 13:04.520]  It didn't have the big, fat, white leaves you would expect an indica plant to have.
[13:04.520 --> 13:06.520]  It had more of a skinny sativa structure.
[13:06.520 --> 13:10.520]  That plant was very, very CBD-rich.
[13:11.520 --> 13:15.520]  That one grew exactly like all of the other THC plants in the garden.
[13:15.520 --> 13:19.520]  It got tall, it got branchy, it looked just like them, it smelled just like them.
[13:19.520 --> 13:22.520]  When we cut it down and tested it, it was mostly ...
[13:22.520 --> 13:24.520]  I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head,
[13:24.520 --> 13:28.520]  but I know that that one was around for the CBD, and it was very CBD-rich.
[13:28.520 --> 13:32.520]  I wasn't doing anything in the grow special to bring out the CBD.
[13:32.520 --> 13:34.520]  It was just happening from that plant.
[13:34.520 --> 13:36.520]  It was that plant's trait.
[13:36.520 --> 13:38.520]  The Harlequin grew tall and skinny.
[13:39.520 --> 13:44.520]  It looked a lot like the other THC-dominant sativa-style plants in the room.
[13:44.520 --> 13:47.520]  The other one we were growing is ACDC.
[13:47.520 --> 13:49.520]  The ACDC was similar to the Harlequin.
[13:49.520 --> 13:52.520]  It was a tall plant, it was branchy, it had those skinnier leaves,
[13:52.520 --> 13:56.520]  it branched out quite a bit, had more of a sativa look.
[13:56.520 --> 13:57.520]  I just keep saying sativa.
[13:57.520 --> 14:01.520]  It had that branchier sativa look, not the short, squatty indica thing
[14:01.520 --> 14:04.520]  that we think of sometimes when we may think of CBD plants.
[14:04.520 --> 14:08.520]  These two looked like our normal THC plants.
[14:08.520 --> 14:10.520]  They grew just like them.
[14:10.520 --> 14:12.520]  They got the longer, skinnier leaves.
[14:12.520 --> 14:13.520]  It didn't do anything different.
[14:13.520 --> 14:18.520]  It didn't smell, look, taste, or grow any differently than the rest of the grow.
[14:18.520 --> 14:21.520]  Those were rich, rich in CBD.
[14:21.520 --> 14:22.520]  We didn't do anything.
[14:22.520 --> 14:25.520]  I didn't do anything to either one of those plants to make them different.
[14:25.520 --> 14:31.520]  There was, however, a plant that I did grow that was known to be rich in CBD
[14:31.520 --> 14:36.520]  that was a, honestly, it was a picky, finicky little bitch.
[14:36.520 --> 14:38.520]  That plant didn't like anybody or anything.
[14:38.520 --> 14:41.520]  Everybody I gave that plant to was like, yeah, I got rid of it.
[14:41.520 --> 14:42.520]  Fuck that plant.
[14:42.520 --> 14:44.520]  That plant was called Tora Bora.
[14:44.520 --> 14:46.520]  That plant was a gift from a friend.
[14:46.520 --> 14:48.520]  They won CBD awards with this plant.
[14:48.520 --> 14:51.520]  This plant produced really great CBD numbers.
[14:51.520 --> 14:55.520]  It was like a 2.5 to 1 CBD to THC.
[14:55.520 --> 15:00.520]  That meant for every THC nanogram or milliliter in the percentage that was there,
[15:01.520 --> 15:05.520]  there were 2.5 times that of CBD.
[15:05.520 --> 15:11.520]  If there's one THC, there was 2.5, whatever your measurement in increments was, of CBD.
[15:11.520 --> 15:14.520]  That was unheard of and amazing at that time.
[15:14.520 --> 15:18.520]  That plant went around the medical marijuana community here in Southern Colorado for quite a while.
[15:18.520 --> 15:19.520]  I got it.
[15:19.520 --> 15:22.520]  I'm not sure I was supposed to spread it out, but since it's medicine like that,
[15:22.520 --> 15:23.520]  I fucking spread it out.
[15:23.520 --> 15:25.520]  I gave that cut to a lot of people.
[15:25.520 --> 15:27.520]  Also, I bred to it.
[15:27.520 --> 15:30.520]  None of the breeding projects that came out of that were worth the shit either.
[15:30.520 --> 15:32.520]  All the offspring were a little bit funky.
[15:32.520 --> 15:33.520]  They were finicky.
[15:33.520 --> 15:34.520]  They were picky.
[15:34.520 --> 15:36.520]  It was not the best breeding ever.
[15:36.520 --> 15:38.520]  Let's talk briefly about the Tora Bora.
[15:38.520 --> 15:42.520]  It looked like a purple, squatty indica plant.
[15:42.520 --> 15:45.520]  No matter what you did to it, it would look angry and frustrated.
[15:45.520 --> 15:47.520]  The leaves would curl up at the tips.
[15:47.520 --> 15:50.520]  It would turn purple and dark by the end of flower.
[15:50.520 --> 15:52.520]  It was an OG Kush dominant plant.
[15:52.520 --> 15:54.520]  I can't remember the cross off the top of my head.
[15:54.520 --> 15:56.520]  It was OG 18 and something else.
[15:56.520 --> 15:59.520]  Maybe LA Confidential, but they called it Tora Bora.
[15:59.520 --> 16:01.520]  It was from DNA Genetics.
[16:01.520 --> 16:02.520]  I'm not bashing their strain.
[16:02.520 --> 16:04.520]  I'm bashing the cut that we had.
[16:04.520 --> 16:09.520]  It put out amazing medicine, but it was a bitch to grow.
[16:09.520 --> 16:12.520]  It was the worst to grow in the garden.
[16:12.520 --> 16:13.520]  It was squatty.
[16:13.520 --> 16:14.520]  It was short.
[16:14.520 --> 16:15.520]  It was stout.
[16:15.520 --> 16:16.520]  It didn't like water.
[16:16.520 --> 16:17.520]  It didn't like being dry.
[16:17.520 --> 16:18.520]  It didn't like warm.
[16:18.520 --> 16:22.520]  It liked being cold and fucking just leave it alone and let it grow.
[16:22.520 --> 16:23.520]  If you topped it, it would slow down.
[16:23.520 --> 16:25.520]  If you popped and twisted, it would get angry on you.
[16:25.520 --> 16:28.520]  That plant sucked to grow.
[16:28.520 --> 16:34.520]  The things I can say is in my experience, there wasn't anything we—but that plant,
[16:34.520 --> 16:38.520]  that Tora Bora plant that sucked put out high numbers no matter what we did.
[16:38.520 --> 16:40.520]  I think it's plant specific.
[16:40.520 --> 16:44.520]  If you grow the plant like you're growing the THC plants, it should put out the high CBD
[16:44.520 --> 16:46.520]  if that is what the plant does.
[16:46.520 --> 16:49.520]  I haven't tried to bring out the CBD, honestly.
[16:49.520 --> 16:53.520]  I grow—when you're running a 300 fucking light area and you've got thousands of plants
[16:53.520 --> 16:55.520]  in there, they all get fed the same thing.
[16:55.520 --> 16:57.520]  They all get treated basically the same way.
[16:57.520 --> 17:01.520]  There may be rows that get treated a certain way, but I don't—we didn't do anything
[17:01.520 --> 17:04.520]  special to bring out the CBD and the CBD-rich plants.
[17:04.520 --> 17:11.520]  I can talk about things that I know they do on commercial CBD farms, hemp farms that do
[17:11.520 --> 17:15.520]  bring out the CBD, but also this is done in Colorado.
[17:15.520 --> 17:16.520]  This is my setup to this.
[17:17.520 --> 17:20.520]  In Colorado, we have to test our CBD.
[17:20.520 --> 17:24.520]  Our hemp crops have to be tested for THC and CBD.
[17:24.520 --> 17:29.520]  If there is the higher amount of THC than allowed in there, that crop cannot be sold
[17:29.520 --> 17:30.520]  as hemp.
[17:30.520 --> 17:33.520]  That is now a cannabis crop, and if you're a hemp grower, that's now illegal.
[17:33.520 --> 17:34.520]  It's got to be thrown away.
[17:34.520 --> 17:35.520]  It's trash.
[17:35.520 --> 17:42.520]  One thing that the hemp growers do to prevent their test from getting too high in THC,
[17:43.520 --> 17:45.520]  oftentimes they will cut the plants down early.
[17:45.520 --> 17:50.520]  You don't have—I'm not going to assume you've got the ability to test your plants
[17:50.520 --> 17:56.520]  on like a daily basis, but in some cases, these guys on the farms with big CBD farms
[17:56.520 --> 18:02.520]  will cut a bud off of the branch, off the plant every three, every five days, every
[18:02.520 --> 18:03.520]  week.
[18:03.520 --> 18:08.520]  Starting around week six, they'll start—maybe week five, start taking buds off and mailing
[18:08.520 --> 18:11.520]  it into the lab or getting it to the lab so they can test it.
[18:11.520 --> 18:17.520]  The minute we see the THC starting to rise higher than acceptable, if we start seeing
[18:17.520 --> 18:21.520]  THC in there, we've got to cut down the plants because now they're going to start—the
[18:21.520 --> 18:22.520]  cannabinoids are going to start converting.
[18:22.520 --> 18:25.520]  The CBD will now become THC.
[18:25.520 --> 18:28.520]  That is their way around a lot of failing lab tests.
[18:28.520 --> 18:33.520]  Just cut it early before it can become THC, before it can convert.
[18:33.520 --> 18:35.520]  Also, that may be a thing you can do.
[18:36.520 --> 18:39.520]  If you want higher CBD and less THC, you may cut it down earlier.
[18:39.520 --> 18:42.520]  I'm not saying that's a way to do it, but that is something I've seen done in Colorado.
[18:42.520 --> 18:45.520]  If you want to get it before it gets to THC, you can do that.
[18:45.520 --> 18:49.520]  If you're making topicals or something and it's not smokable, that may be a viable
[18:49.520 --> 18:50.520]  option for you.
[18:50.520 --> 18:55.520]  Another thing I do think helps is colder temperatures seems to bring out that CBD.
[18:55.520 --> 18:56.520]  I can't promise that.
[18:56.520 --> 18:59.520]  That is something I've heard the CBD growers mention.
[18:59.520 --> 19:01.520]  So, grow it just like normal.
[19:01.520 --> 19:02.520]  Dial it in.
[19:03.520 --> 19:06.520]  I always say, grow that cultivar, grow that plant a few times.
[19:06.520 --> 19:11.520]  If you've got something that you know presents CBD, grow it the best you can and see how
[19:11.520 --> 19:13.520]  much CBD you are getting out of it.
[19:13.520 --> 19:16.520]  One thing I can recommend is cut it down at different intervals.
[19:16.520 --> 19:19.520]  Maybe cut one at week seven, one at week eight, and one at week nine.
[19:19.520 --> 19:22.520]  Maybe cut a branch at week seven, eight, and nine and see which one is better for you.
[19:22.520 --> 19:26.520]  But to the best of my memory, the best of my knowledge, the best of my ability, we just
[19:26.520 --> 19:31.520]  grow the CBD-rich plants exactly like we do the THC, and we just let them produce the
[19:32.520 --> 19:35.520]  cannabinoids they naturally create for us.
[19:35.520 --> 19:39.520]  Dial in the room, dial in the plants, build a relationship with it, and hopefully you
[19:39.520 --> 19:41.520]  can get those numbers up right where you need them.
[19:41.520 --> 19:42.520]  Good luck to mom.
[19:42.520 --> 19:43.520]  I hope she is cancer-free.
[19:43.520 --> 19:44.520]  I hope she's feeling better.
[19:44.520 --> 19:45.520]  I hope you're able to help her out.
[19:45.520 --> 19:47.520]  Give her a hug for us.
[19:47.520 --> 19:49.520]  And thank you for the great message, Kojaks.
[19:49.520 --> 19:52.520]  And of course, thank you for the Patreon contribution.
[19:52.520 --> 19:55.520]  I'm going to hit this bottle of water here, and we're going to keep moving.
[19:55.520 --> 19:59.520]  You guys take a hit off a bowl or a rip off a bong while I take a rip off this bottle
[19:59.520 --> 20:02.520]  of water, or maybe hydrate yourself as well.
[20:02.520 --> 20:03.520]  Here we go.
[20:07.320 --> 20:08.320]  Yeah.
[20:09.320 --> 20:10.320]  Keep that voice fresh, right?
[20:11.320 --> 20:12.320]  All right.
[20:12.320 --> 20:13.320]  I'm not even going to edit that part out of the show.
[20:13.320 --> 20:14.320]  Thank you for joining me.
[20:14.320 --> 20:16.320]  I've got another message.
[20:16.320 --> 20:17.320]  This one comes from the email box.
[20:17.320 --> 20:19.320]  It comes from Mo Roots.
[20:19.320 --> 20:20.320]  Big roots, big respect.
[20:20.320 --> 20:21.320]  Thank you for the message.
[20:21.320 --> 20:24.320]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff, I have another question for you.
[20:25.320 --> 20:28.320]  The question is to flush or not to flush?
[20:28.320 --> 20:30.320]  That is a great, very controversial question.
[20:30.320 --> 20:36.320]  It says, the guys on the Dude Grows show have talked about whether it's beneficial or not.
[20:36.320 --> 20:38.320]  Is this something new?
[20:38.320 --> 20:40.320]  Flushing has been a hot topic for quite a while.
[20:40.320 --> 20:42.320]  I've talked about it a couple of times.
[20:42.320 --> 20:44.320]  It always comes up in the cannabis community.
[20:44.320 --> 20:45.320]  It's a great question.
[20:45.320 --> 20:46.320]  It says, have you tried this before?
[20:46.320 --> 20:48.320]  Is there new information about flushing?
[20:48.320 --> 20:50.320]  Thanks again for your help, and have a great day.
[20:50.320 --> 20:51.320]  You can say my name.
[20:51.320 --> 20:52.320]  It is Ryan.
[20:52.320 --> 20:53.320]  What's up, Ryan?
[20:53.320 --> 20:54.320]  Thank you for the great message.
[20:55.320 --> 20:56.320]  So let's get into this.
[20:56.320 --> 20:58.320]  We're going to stir up controversy on this episode.
[20:58.320 --> 20:59.320]  I look forward to your feedback.
[20:59.320 --> 21:03.320]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[21:03.320 --> 21:07.320]  Make sure you put the word flushing in the subject line when you respond about this.
[21:07.320 --> 21:08.320]  Flushing.
[21:08.320 --> 21:13.320]  There are a lot of ways to look at flushing, a lot of ideas behind flushing, a lot of purposes to flushing.
[21:15.320 --> 21:19.320]  And I see two different or three or maybe four different approaches to flushing.
[21:19.320 --> 21:25.320]  If you're growing in a super soil, if you have taken a natural organic product, a bunch of,
[21:26.320 --> 21:32.320]  I don't even know what's going to go in our super soil, alfalfa meal, we would hear bone meal, fish meal, blood meal.
[21:32.320 --> 21:34.320]  I wouldn't put that stuff, but that type of stuff goes in.
[21:34.320 --> 21:39.320]  If you've got an organic living soil, if you're building a soil and it is cooking,
[21:39.320 --> 21:47.320]  and you're not using chelated, bottled, buffered nutrients, there may not be a need for flushing
[21:47.320 --> 21:51.320]  because your plant is not going to uptake things that it doesn't need.
[21:51.320 --> 21:52.320]  We're not force feeding the plant.
[21:52.320 --> 21:58.320]  When you make an organic soil that is just naturally bioavailable to the plant, the roots go down,
[21:58.320 --> 22:02.320]  and this is just the very simple version of this, don't get on me too critically.
[22:02.320 --> 22:08.320]  The roots start growing and they're growing and they say, the plant goes, hey roots, we need some nitrogen.
[22:08.320 --> 22:10.320]  And the plants go, oh, there's nitrogen over here.
[22:10.320 --> 22:13.320]  And it just grows down and gets it and it eats up nitrogen and then exudates in the plant,
[22:13.320 --> 22:19.320]  communicate with enzymes that communicate with the rhizosphere that says, hey bro, we got enough nitrogen.
[22:19.320 --> 22:23.320]  You think you can send up some molybdenum and the roots go, molybdenum, we got you bro.
[22:23.320 --> 22:26.320]  Turn off the nitrogen suckers, start shooting molybdenum around.
[22:26.320 --> 22:30.320]  Now it's like basically you had enough of your main course, whatever your main course was,
[22:30.320 --> 22:32.320]  maybe now could you send me some mashed potatoes down?
[22:32.320 --> 22:34.320]  Sure, bro, we got mashed potatoes for you.
[22:34.320 --> 22:36.320]  So now you're just getting different things.
[22:36.320 --> 22:40.320]  The plant signals that it needs different things through exudates to the root zone.
[22:40.320 --> 22:41.320]  The root zone goes, oh, you need this?
[22:41.320 --> 22:42.320]  We'll go find it.
[22:42.320 --> 22:43.320]  And it goes and finds those things.
[22:43.320 --> 22:46.320]  The plant basically eats what it needs when it needs it.
[22:46.320 --> 22:50.320]  It's there bioavailable in your plant, in the rhizosphere, in the root zone,
[22:50.320 --> 22:54.320]  because you've whipped up and cooked an organic soil or a living soil
[22:54.320 --> 22:57.320]  that has got all of your necessities in that soil.
[22:57.320 --> 23:00.320]  So the plant, it's not going to overfeed itself.
[23:00.320 --> 23:01.320]  It's not going to stuff itself.
[23:01.320 --> 23:02.320]  It's not a fat glutton.
[23:02.320 --> 23:06.320]  It's not going to get a big old pot belly.
[23:06.320 --> 23:07.320]  Jeez, that was hard to say.
[23:07.320 --> 23:10.320]  It's not going to get a big old pot belly and just sit around and become lazy
[23:10.320 --> 23:12.320]  because it's got to work for its food.
[23:12.320 --> 23:15.320]  It's got triggers that tell it, I'm full, I should stop eating.
[23:15.320 --> 23:20.320]  The difference when we're feeding bottled, chelated nutrients is that there are
[23:20.320 --> 23:23.320]  things in those nutrients that tell the plant, fucking eat this.
[23:23.320 --> 23:27.320]  And you're basically just injecting the plant with more nutrients all day long.
[23:27.320 --> 23:30.320]  The signals to tell it to stop don't work because it's not eating the right,
[23:30.320 --> 23:31.320]  the same kind of food.
[23:31.320 --> 23:32.320]  I just said right food.
[23:32.320 --> 23:34.320]  Maybe that organic way is the way to go.
[23:34.320 --> 23:36.320]  It's not eating the things that would tell that plant, yeah,
[23:36.320 --> 23:37.320]  I've had enough nitrogen.
[23:37.320 --> 23:39.320]  Let's work on that molybdenum.
[23:39.320 --> 23:42.320]  There are things in those chelated, buffered nutrients that go,
[23:42.320 --> 23:43.320]  oh, nitrogen, take more.
[23:43.320 --> 23:44.320]  Oh, nitrogen, take more.
[23:44.320 --> 23:46.320]  And it's almost like drugs for your plants.
[23:46.320 --> 23:49.320]  The plants will easily, easily overdo it.
[23:49.320 --> 23:52.320]  So with those two things in mind, with the salts and the bottled,
[23:52.320 --> 23:57.320]  chelated nutrients, let's talk about why to flush one and why one may not be necessary.
[23:57.320 --> 24:00.320]  I'm sure you could see it with the bottled, chelated nutrients.
[24:00.320 --> 24:05.320]  We've got a soil that is filled with salts, bottled nutrients, chelations,
[24:05.320 --> 24:08.320]  weird ionic exchanges that I'm not even sure what's happening in there.
[24:08.320 --> 24:11.320]  That plant's being force-fed shit all day long.
[24:11.320 --> 24:15.320]  So that plant may need to be flushed because it's got a lot of excess stuff running
[24:15.320 --> 24:17.320]  through that plant, through its vascular system.
[24:17.320 --> 24:20.320]  It's got things moving around, mobile elements that we may not,
[24:20.320 --> 24:23.320]  that may not be, we're going to talk about this part in a moment,
[24:23.320 --> 24:26.320]  that may not be desirable when it comes to smoking time.
[24:26.320 --> 24:29.320]  It may not make our plants burn and taste the best that it could.
[24:29.320 --> 24:34.320]  So in my opinion, it is absolutely desirable and best to flush,
[24:34.320 --> 24:38.320]  if you're using bottled nutrients, absolutely flush for 7, 10,
[24:38.320 --> 24:43.320]  maybe 14 days, depending on how much you fed, what you fed and what's in your pot.
[24:43.320 --> 24:45.320]  Are you using cocoa? Are you using soilless mix?
[24:45.320 --> 24:49.320]  If you're in hydro, you can definitely go like 10 days and you should be clean
[24:49.320 --> 24:50.320]  if you didn't overfeed.
[24:50.320 --> 24:54.320]  If you're using a soilless mix, you might want to flush for like 14 days,
[24:54.320 --> 24:57.320]  clean out that rhizosphere, clean everything out, get the plants to quit eating,
[24:57.320 --> 24:59.320]  let them cannibalize themselves.
[24:59.320 --> 25:03.320]  Now, if you're using organics and you didn't put anything that was buffered,
[25:03.320 --> 25:07.320]  chelated in there, it may not be necessary to flush.
[25:07.320 --> 25:11.320]  I cannot tell you you don't need to flush because I don't want to fuck up your grow.
[25:11.320 --> 25:14.320]  But the plants aren't eating anything unnecessary.
[25:14.320 --> 25:18.320]  If the plants are done and they know it is time, if they're in senescence,
[25:18.320 --> 25:20.320]  they've stopped eating anyway, they're just going to quit eating,
[25:20.320 --> 25:23.320]  they're going to cannibalize themselves and they're going to fade off like it is fall.
[25:23.320 --> 25:25.320]  They're only supposed to be around for a year.
[25:25.320 --> 25:27.320]  They don't expect to live any longer.
[25:27.320 --> 25:29.320]  So you may not need to flush.
[25:29.320 --> 25:32.320]  Also, our friend Subcool, shout out to Subcool,
[25:32.320 --> 25:34.320]  he used to whip up super soil mixes and he would say,
[25:34.320 --> 25:36.320]  I've been flushing the whole time.
[25:36.320 --> 25:41.320]  He would make a batch of soil that in his experience would be strong enough,
[25:41.320 --> 25:46.320]  lively enough, potent enough, nutrient rich enough to last the duration of the grow.
[25:46.320 --> 25:49.320]  He would start in a veg pot, then right before a flower,
[25:49.320 --> 25:52.320]  he would up that pot into a larger pot with fresh soil in it.
[25:52.320 --> 25:56.320]  Those roots would grow into that and eat all the nutrients in that soil
[25:56.320 --> 25:58.320]  and feed the plant through its whole life.
[25:58.320 --> 26:00.320]  All he has to do is feed it water.
[26:00.320 --> 26:02.320]  All I've been doing is flushing the whole time is what he would say.
[26:02.320 --> 26:06.320]  So in that situation, like we're saying, he's been flushing the entire time
[26:06.320 --> 26:08.320]  and the plant is not being force fed.
[26:08.320 --> 26:12.320]  It may not be necessary to actually flush in that type of environment.
[26:12.320 --> 26:14.320]  I am open to feedback.
[26:14.320 --> 26:15.320]  I'm open to opinions.
[26:15.320 --> 26:16.320]  I'm open to education.
[26:16.320 --> 26:19.320]  I am not the definitive answer of cannabis.
[26:19.320 --> 26:23.320]  I'm still learning just like you, but these are my opinions and my experience.
[26:23.320 --> 26:27.320]  I think if you're using bottled nutrients, absolutely do flush.
[26:27.320 --> 26:29.320]  If you're not using buffered, chelated nutrients,
[26:29.320 --> 26:32.320]  if you've got a super soil, maybe it's not necessary to flush.
[26:32.320 --> 26:34.320]  I'm not going to tell you not to flush.
[26:34.320 --> 26:36.320]  I don't know for sure.
[26:36.320 --> 26:40.320]  Now let's talk about something that I honestly,
[26:40.320 --> 26:45.320]  I don't have the real scientific, botanical, biological education
[26:45.320 --> 26:50.320]  to open this can of worms, but here is how my brain thinks about it.
[26:50.320 --> 26:56.320]  The things we have fed the plant aren't in that plant as nitrogen, potassium,
[26:56.320 --> 26:59.320]  phosphorus, calmag, molybdenum.
[26:59.320 --> 27:03.320]  That stuff has been converted into plant material, plant matter,
[27:03.320 --> 27:05.320]  biomass if you will.
[27:05.320 --> 27:09.320]  It has been photosynthesized and processed into stuff.
[27:09.320 --> 27:15.320]  If I went and I ate 7,000 fucking Snickers bars today,
[27:15.320 --> 27:20.320]  if you eat me, if you smoke me, it's not burning Snickers bars.
[27:20.320 --> 27:22.320]  Snickers bars are not me.
[27:22.320 --> 27:23.320]  I'm not Snickers bars.
[27:23.320 --> 27:24.320]  I am Rasta Jeff.
[27:24.320 --> 27:25.320]  I am Jeff.
[27:25.320 --> 27:29.320]  I have converted all of those Snickers bars into biomass.
[27:29.320 --> 27:31.320]  It's either fat, it's fat.
[27:31.320 --> 27:33.320]  It's fucking fat and diabetes is what it's going to be,
[27:33.320 --> 27:35.320]  and the rest of it was a poop.
[27:35.320 --> 27:38.320]  I've converted into a turd and biomass.
[27:38.320 --> 27:43.320]  You're not going to find Snickers bars in me for maybe like an hour after I eat it.
[27:43.320 --> 27:45.320]  You might find pieces of Snickers bars.
[27:45.320 --> 27:47.320]  You'll identify peanuts for a real long time,
[27:47.320 --> 27:49.320]  but I think the plants aren't going to have,
[27:49.320 --> 27:50.320]  if you feed the plant Snickers bars,
[27:50.320 --> 27:53.320]  they're not going to fucking have Snickers bars hanging off the branches.
[27:53.320 --> 27:54.320]  It's going to break down Snickers bars.
[27:54.320 --> 27:57.320]  It's going to kill your plant, but follow me what I'm saying here.
[27:57.320 --> 27:59.320]  It's not going to be Snickers bars in the plant.
[27:59.320 --> 28:02.320]  It's going to metabolize and turn into biomass and plant matter,
[28:02.320 --> 28:07.320]  leaves, stalks, buds, trichomes, shoots, terpenes.
[28:07.320 --> 28:08.320]  It's going to turn into esters, paleo.
[28:08.320 --> 28:11.320]  It's going to turn into all kinds of shit, sugars.
[28:11.320 --> 28:14.320]  So I don't know that what are we flushing out?
[28:14.320 --> 28:16.320]  What are you trying to do?
[28:16.320 --> 28:18.320]  You can only, like if I tried to flush me,
[28:18.320 --> 28:21.320]  I can only pee and poop so much and only so much is going to come out.
[28:21.320 --> 28:24.320]  After that, I'm just going to piss and shit pure water.
[28:24.320 --> 28:27.320]  You can't then, am I going to smoke better?
[28:27.320 --> 28:28.320]  Am I going to burn better? I don't know.
[28:28.320 --> 28:30.320]  So I don't know what you're trying to get out.
[28:30.320 --> 28:33.320]  You're trying to flush out nutrients, but they're in the leaves.
[28:33.320 --> 28:34.320]  They're in the stalks.
[28:34.320 --> 28:36.320]  The buds have become buds.
[28:36.320 --> 28:41.320]  It has turned all of your building blocks of life into a plant.
[28:41.320 --> 28:43.320]  So flushing is controversial,
[28:43.320 --> 28:47.320]  and I wish I had some science to back up the part I'm talking about now.
[28:47.320 --> 28:50.320]  There are people that have much better education than me on that,
[28:50.320 --> 28:51.320]  and I'm willing to admit, you guys,
[28:51.320 --> 28:55.320]  I'm not the most book and school educator when it comes to cannabis,
[28:55.320 --> 28:56.320]  but I've fucking done it.
[28:56.320 --> 28:57.320]  I put my hands on the plants.
[28:57.320 --> 28:58.320]  I've done a lot of things.
[28:58.320 --> 28:59.320]  That's why I feel that I'm credible.
[28:59.320 --> 29:01.320]  Not to discredit the school guys.
[29:01.320 --> 29:03.320]  I need one of the school guys to back me up on this question,
[29:03.320 --> 29:08.320]  but in my opinion, definitely flush with salt, nutrients, hydro,
[29:08.320 --> 29:09.320]  something like that.
[29:09.320 --> 29:12.320]  Maybe you don't need to flush if you're running organics.
[29:12.320 --> 29:15.320]  My question to you is what are you trying to flush out?
[29:15.320 --> 29:16.320]  What are we trying to do?
[29:16.320 --> 29:18.320]  We want to clean rhizosphere
[29:18.320 --> 29:21.320]  so that the plants don't have a bunch of stuff in them when we smoke it.
[29:21.320 --> 29:24.320]  If you don't overfeed it, if you didn't overfertilize,
[29:24.320 --> 29:26.320]  it should burn cleanly at the end.
[29:26.320 --> 29:27.320]  Maybe do an experiment.
[29:27.320 --> 29:29.320]  Maybe grow one plant and don't flush it,
[29:29.320 --> 29:33.320]  and grow one plant and flush for 14 days, dry and cure exactly the same.
[29:33.320 --> 29:35.320]  Let's smoke them at the end and see.
[29:35.320 --> 29:37.320]  Let's see if we really can tell.
[29:37.320 --> 29:39.320]  Let's see if that shit we're blaming that crunchy ash on
[29:39.320 --> 29:42.320]  is something else other than just a basic flush.
[29:42.320 --> 29:44.320]  That's my two cents on that part.
[29:44.320 --> 29:47.320]  I do have some feedback on one other avenue of this question.
[29:48.320 --> 29:54.320]  I do know that we had a commercial grow that had an incident.
[29:54.320 --> 29:55.320]  I can't get into their business.
[29:55.320 --> 29:58.320]  We had to harvest a room a little bit early,
[29:58.320 --> 30:00.320]  and the plants in one section did not get to get flushed.
[30:00.320 --> 30:02.320]  We thought we had more time.
[30:02.320 --> 30:04.320]  Things went wrong.
[30:04.320 --> 30:05.320]  Had to cut down.
[30:05.320 --> 30:08.320]  We decided instead of trying to sell these unflushed flowers
[30:08.320 --> 30:11.320]  that we would freeze it and turn it into fresh frozen live resin.
[30:12.320 --> 30:14.320]  That shit came out amazing.
[30:14.320 --> 30:17.320]  We could not tell that those plants had not been flushed.
[30:17.320 --> 30:20.320]  The live resin that came from just not even flushed,
[30:20.320 --> 30:22.320]  those plants probably got fed that day,
[30:22.320 --> 30:24.320]  and they got cut down, they got froze,
[30:24.320 --> 30:26.320]  they got turned into concentrates,
[30:26.320 --> 30:28.320]  and it tasted fucking beautiful.
[30:28.320 --> 30:33.320]  We did not notice anything in the fresh frozen live resin
[30:33.320 --> 30:34.320]  from plants that were not flushed.
[30:34.320 --> 30:37.320]  That's the only thing I can testify to in that department.
[30:38.320 --> 30:40.320]  I wish I had a more definitive answer to you,
[30:40.320 --> 30:42.320]  but I hope I sparked your mind.
[30:42.320 --> 30:44.320]  I gave you a little bit of guidance.
[30:44.320 --> 30:46.320]  I want to know what do we think we're flushing out.
[30:46.320 --> 30:50.320]  Like I keep saying, all the stuff we fed the plant became the plant.
[30:50.320 --> 30:53.320]  It didn't become like little bags of phosphorus and potassium
[30:53.320 --> 30:54.320]  hanging off the plant.
[30:54.320 --> 30:56.320]  It's not moving around as that still.
[30:56.320 --> 30:58.320]  It's a plant now.
[30:58.320 --> 30:59.320]  There's a lot to think about there.
[30:59.320 --> 31:00.320]  I will continue to read.
[31:00.320 --> 31:03.320]  I will always continue to educate myself on cannabis.
[31:03.320 --> 31:06.320]  When I do have a real solid definitive answer on this,
[31:06.320 --> 31:08.320]  I will be here on the show to talk about it.
[31:08.320 --> 31:10.320]  Maybe I'll bring somebody on the show that can explain it to me.
[31:10.320 --> 31:13.320]  If you can explain that science, I'd love to have you on the show.

[32:54.320 --> 32:55.320]  Reach on out.
[32:55.320 --> 32:56.320]  Send me some info.
[32:56.320 --> 32:58.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's all I've got for you for this episode.
[32:58.320 --> 32:59.320]  Thanks again for joining me.
[32:59.320 --> 33:02.320]  I'll be back in just a couple of days with fresh new content.
[33:02.320 --> 33:04.320]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy, Buzzbro.
[33:04.320 --> 33:08.320]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
