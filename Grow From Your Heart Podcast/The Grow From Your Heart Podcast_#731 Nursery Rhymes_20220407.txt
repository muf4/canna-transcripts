[00:00.190 --> 00:34.410]  All right, here we go.
[00:34.410 --> 00:36.090]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:36.090 --> 00:37.090]  I'm your host.
[00:37.090 --> 00:38.690]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:38.690 --> 00:44.090]  This is episode 731 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:44.090 --> 00:48.270]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on a couple of listener emails before I get to that part
[00:48.270 --> 00:49.270]  of the show.
[00:49.270 --> 00:53.730]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who continue to support the show
[00:53.730 --> 00:55.410]  on Patreon.
[00:55.410 --> 00:58.050]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:58.050 --> 00:59.050]  Thank you.
[00:59.050 --> 01:00.570]  Shout out to my buddy, Grow Bandit.

[01:26.910 --> 01:30.150]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:30.150 --> 01:31.150]  Thank you.
[01:31.150 --> 01:33.390]  Shout out to the new old guy.

[02:36.190 --> 02:38.550]  Truly you guys, thank you for all of that support.
[02:38.550 --> 02:39.550]  All right.
[02:39.870 --> 02:41.770]  I don't have a lot to ramble about here at the beginning.
[02:41.770 --> 02:44.150]  I can make this show super long at the start.
[02:44.150 --> 02:48.430]  Let's jump right into it and get into a message that came from our Patreon page.
[02:48.430 --> 02:50.110]  This one came from my buddy Tonto.
[02:50.110 --> 02:52.310]  Big up to my buddy Tonto out there in Canada.
[02:52.310 --> 02:53.310]  Hope you're well, bro.
[02:53.310 --> 02:54.310]  I hope the family is well.
[02:54.310 --> 02:57.470]  My message from my buddy Tonto goes a lot like this.
[02:57.470 --> 02:58.710]  It says, Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[02:58.710 --> 03:02.310]  I have a couple of questions that I think might be good for the show.
[03:02.310 --> 03:03.470]  Let's start with this one.
[03:03.470 --> 03:04.630]  This is a great spot to start.
[03:04.630 --> 03:07.150]  It says, I have a bunch of medical conditions.
[03:07.150 --> 03:10.910]  They make gardening a struggle during certain parts of the year.
[03:10.910 --> 03:16.270]  My PTSD, depression, and back issues make a lovely cocktail of reasons not to get my
[03:16.270 --> 03:18.310]  gardening work done.
[03:18.310 --> 03:22.270]  I understand that with a lot of PTSD, depression, back issues.
[03:22.270 --> 03:26.150]  That's three solid excuses to not get out of bed, not get off the couch, not get shit
[03:26.150 --> 03:27.150]  done all day.
[03:27.150 --> 03:28.510]  We're going to talk more about that.
[03:28.510 --> 03:34.150]  It says those conditions are the main reasons I've pulled enough or been pulled into organic
[03:34.150 --> 03:35.150]  growing.
[03:35.150 --> 03:38.870]  Are there ways to make the workload easier or less growing with this style?
[03:38.870 --> 03:43.110]  I'm assuming that there are many others out there like me who struggle to keep the garden
[03:43.110 --> 03:44.930]  in tip top shape.
[03:44.930 --> 03:48.750]  What would you advise someone with medical conditions as the minimum things you would
[03:48.750 --> 03:53.110]  need to do both in veg and flour to keep everything going?
[03:53.110 --> 03:54.350]  So that is the first question.
[03:54.350 --> 03:56.150]  That's a very good question.
[03:56.150 --> 04:01.470]  Man, I'm not sure exactly where to start for everybody, but I can give you tips and advice
[04:01.470 --> 04:04.750]  for your needs and for possibly my needs.
[04:04.750 --> 04:09.910]  But if you've got different limiting factors, then I'm not sure what I would recommend.
[04:09.910 --> 04:14.830]  So you ask what are the minimum things you would need to do both in veg and garden?
[04:14.830 --> 04:16.430]  So what advice would you give somebody?
[04:16.430 --> 04:19.290]  The minimum things, the plants need to be watered.
[04:19.290 --> 04:23.910]  That's the most important thing as a cannabis grower who likes to go places, likes to get
[04:23.910 --> 04:24.910]  away.
[04:24.910 --> 04:27.950]  One of the things I think about is are these plants going to get water?
[04:27.950 --> 04:30.650]  So set the plants up in a way that you can water them.
[04:30.650 --> 04:33.030]  Is the water itself accessible?
[04:33.030 --> 04:34.030]  Where does it come from?
[04:34.310 --> 04:35.310]  Does it come from a faucet?
[04:35.310 --> 04:38.030]  Does it come from a sink, a shower, some sort of a tap, a well?
[04:38.030 --> 04:40.590]  Do you have to fucking pull the water out of the lake?
[04:40.590 --> 04:41.790]  Where does the water come from?
[04:41.790 --> 04:44.950]  Make the water easily accessible, easily portable to your grow.
[04:44.950 --> 04:46.390]  That's going to be the first step.
[04:46.390 --> 04:49.750]  We have to water these plants at least twice, maybe three or four times a week, depending
[04:49.750 --> 04:51.130]  on the size.
[04:51.130 --> 04:54.070]  So maybe set it up to where it's easy to water it.
[04:54.070 --> 04:56.270]  If it's easier to water it, you'll do it more.
[04:56.270 --> 04:59.810]  Make sure that you're, let's even back up a whole another step.
[04:59.810 --> 05:04.770]  Is your entire grow space clean, tidy, and organized and inviting?
[05:04.770 --> 05:08.690]  I've noticed that when my workspace, if it's my office, if it's my garage workspace, if
[05:08.690 --> 05:14.310]  it's my grow workspace, if it's the podcast area, when that space gets cluttered and it's
[05:14.310 --> 05:20.290]  not inviting and presentable, my mind is cluttered when I'm there and I can't perform to the
[05:20.290 --> 05:21.410]  best of my ability.
[05:21.410 --> 05:24.570]  So I make sure to keep my grow space as clean as I can.
[05:24.570 --> 05:30.210]  My nutrient mixing station, my nutrient storage area, all of that stuff is, it looks like
[05:30.210 --> 05:34.490]  military grade cleaning happened in there and that invites me to want to go in there.
[05:34.490 --> 05:36.570]  I don't go in there and go, I got to move this shit out of the way.
[05:36.570 --> 05:37.570]  I got to look for this.
[05:37.570 --> 05:41.690]  I go, I can go in this place where it is organized and streamlined and ready for me to go.
[05:41.690 --> 05:46.230]  So from the very beginning, have everything clean, organized, streamlined, ready to go
[05:46.230 --> 05:51.050]  so that you can set yourself up for success and be invited in there by yourself.
[05:51.050 --> 05:52.490]  Then maybe put some music in there.
[05:52.490 --> 05:54.570]  I love listening to podcasts and music.
[05:54.570 --> 05:59.130]  If there is a Bluetooth speaker and a bottle of kombucha, I could be pretty happy just
[05:59.130 --> 06:00.130]  about anywhere.
[06:00.130 --> 06:02.570]  If you give me a dab first, things are really iry.
[06:02.570 --> 06:03.950]  So I like to put on a good podcast.
[06:03.950 --> 06:05.570]  A lot of people listen to me in the grow.
[06:05.570 --> 06:06.570]  What's up?
[06:06.570 --> 06:07.570]  I hope you're having a good day in the grow.
[06:07.570 --> 06:08.570]  Hope I'm getting you through work.
[06:08.570 --> 06:10.070]  Hope things aren't too hard.
[06:10.070 --> 06:11.070]  You're kicking ass today.
[06:11.070 --> 06:12.090]  You're doing your job pretty well.
[06:12.090 --> 06:13.730]  Keep killing it, bro.
[06:13.730 --> 06:17.510]  Also go take that work poop and get paid for it while the boss is not looking.
[06:17.510 --> 06:20.930]  But a lot of people put on a podcast during the workday, but listen to some music, put
[06:20.930 --> 06:24.970]  a Bluetooth speaker in there, get some AirPods, some earbuds, something in there that encourages
[06:24.970 --> 06:25.970]  you to go.
[06:25.970 --> 06:27.090]  I put out two shows a week.
[06:27.090 --> 06:28.990]  You probably got a water at least twice a week.
[06:28.990 --> 06:32.690]  There's two episodes of me to listen to two days of growing covered right there.
[06:32.690 --> 06:34.090]  There's some entertainment.
[06:34.090 --> 06:35.090]  You're from Canada.
[06:35.090 --> 06:36.090]  Maybe you want to listen to some rush.
[06:36.090 --> 06:38.850]  Go put on some Neil Peart and jam out to some Russian there.
[06:38.850 --> 06:41.430]  I'm just picking on you because you're Canadian, but I still love you.
[06:41.430 --> 06:45.050]  But encourage and inspire yourself to go in there before we even start thinking about
[06:45.050 --> 06:46.050]  the gear.
[06:46.050 --> 06:48.650]  The room is everything organized, clean, inviting.
[06:48.650 --> 06:49.650]  Does it smell good?
[06:49.650 --> 06:50.650]  Does it look good?
[06:51.050 --> 06:53.610]  If it's not organized and inviting, I won't want to go in there.
[06:53.610 --> 06:56.410]  And if it's a mess and I do go in there, I'm still not going to work to the best of my
[06:56.410 --> 06:59.850]  potential, my ability, and I'm not going to enjoy it.
[06:59.850 --> 07:00.970]  So let's make it inviting.
[07:00.970 --> 07:05.130]  Get some music going, make it an environment in which you want to be.
[07:05.130 --> 07:08.970]  Now the things that are required of the grower is of course the watering.
[07:08.970 --> 07:11.130]  That's the first thing you're going to need to get done.
[07:11.130 --> 07:14.770]  Can you get the water to the grow without breaking your back or your neck?
[07:14.770 --> 07:19.010]  Can you get that water from a big vessel into the mixing container without breaking your
[07:19.010 --> 07:20.010]  neck or your back?
[07:20.010 --> 07:21.010]  Do you have a good mixing container?
[07:21.010 --> 07:22.250]  Do you have a good pH pen?
[07:22.250 --> 07:23.570]  Do you have a good EC pen?
[07:23.570 --> 07:26.250]  Do you have good mixing containers and devices?
[07:26.250 --> 07:28.170]  Make it fun.
[07:28.170 --> 07:32.010]  Maybe if you have a couple of extra bucks, spend a few bucks on devices to make the growing
[07:32.010 --> 07:34.770]  more simplistic, more streamlined, and more fun.
[07:34.770 --> 07:36.970]  More toys makes it better for a lot of people.
[07:36.970 --> 07:40.730]  If you get that brand new piece of gear, it just may inspire you to regrow again.
[07:40.730 --> 07:42.810]  So maybe a new toy every once in a while.
[07:42.810 --> 07:46.250]  Reward yourself with a new piece of gear, but mainly keep it clean and get it set up.
[07:47.050 --> 07:50.250]  We've got to get an amount of water from one container into these plants.
[07:50.250 --> 07:51.410]  Can you physically do it?
[07:51.410 --> 07:55.090]  If not, let's think about setting up a watering system.
[07:55.090 --> 07:57.530]  You can build a watering system with any sort of reservoir.
[07:57.530 --> 08:01.650]  I like to use a trash can, a 35 or 55 gallon trash can on wheels.
[08:01.650 --> 08:05.650]  You can move it to the water, fill it, move it where it needs to be, drop a submersible
[08:05.650 --> 08:10.610]  pump in there, run some flex line that runs out of that reservoir down to the ground,
[08:10.610 --> 08:12.090]  down across the floor.
[08:12.090 --> 08:15.330]  And then I will put spaghetti tubing that comes out of that with emitters that go to
[08:15.410 --> 08:16.410]  each plant.
[08:16.410 --> 08:18.250]  Then I just set that up with a timer.
[08:18.250 --> 08:23.090]  And then I know that depending on the amount of emitters and the amount of emitters and
[08:23.090 --> 08:26.850]  the amount of plants that I've got and how much water I want, I can set up a timer to
[08:26.850 --> 08:30.250]  where I know that if I turn on the water for, or if I turn on the timer for two minutes,
[08:30.250 --> 08:32.970]  that pump runs for two minutes, my plants will get enough water.
[08:32.970 --> 08:34.770]  It's really easy to figure that out.
[08:34.770 --> 08:37.850]  The first time you do it, you guys, if you want to learn that, get your plants to where
[08:37.850 --> 08:42.930]  they need water, get your auto watering system set up, set a timer, hit go, plug in your
[08:42.930 --> 08:44.010]  pump, let the plants get wet.
[08:44.010 --> 08:47.370]  When they're watered enough, hit stop on the timer, unplug the thing.
[08:47.370 --> 08:50.370]  That's how long you need your plants to come on your timer to come on to water your plants
[08:50.370 --> 08:54.850]  every time, a minute and 40 seconds that will get the plant saturated every time.
[08:54.850 --> 08:57.450]  How long between waterings, maybe every three days.
[08:57.450 --> 09:00.530]  So every third day you need a minute and 40 seconds worth of watering.
[09:00.530 --> 09:02.610]  It's really not that hard to set up once you get figured out.
[09:02.610 --> 09:06.610]  So one of the things you'll have to do is auto watering or some sort of watering that
[09:06.610 --> 09:07.650]  is required.
[09:07.650 --> 09:09.050]  You can't get through without that.
[09:09.050 --> 09:13.410]  Then the plants are likely going to need some sort of supports as they grow.
[09:13.410 --> 09:15.570]  They're going to need up pots, they're going to need transplanting.
[09:15.570 --> 09:17.410]  So that's things you're going to need to think about.
[09:17.410 --> 09:19.450]  I go from a seedling into a cup.
[09:19.450 --> 09:24.810]  Then my cup goes into a three gallon, maybe a one depending on my time space needs, but
[09:24.810 --> 09:29.430]  I'll go from a cup to a maybe a one gallon, maybe right to the three and then from a three,
[09:29.430 --> 09:31.730]  maybe to a five or a seven.
[09:31.730 --> 09:33.810]  But think about your pot sizing.
[09:33.810 --> 09:35.390]  Think about the up pots that you're going to have to do.
[09:35.390 --> 09:36.390]  That's going to have to happen.
[09:36.390 --> 09:37.450]  Then supports.
[09:37.450 --> 09:39.010]  The plants are going to get taller and bigger.
[09:39.010 --> 09:40.210]  They're going to need more supports.
[09:40.210 --> 09:41.890]  Are you going to put a trellis net?
[09:41.890 --> 09:43.610]  Are you going to put sticks in there?
[09:43.610 --> 09:45.130]  That's things that will be required.
[09:45.130 --> 09:50.890]  So some watering, some up potting, some supporting, and then a little bit of defoliation.
[09:50.890 --> 09:54.570]  It's not required, but it will definitely help you and make things easier.
[09:54.570 --> 09:57.570]  So I'm trying to think of things that we have to do.
[09:57.570 --> 09:59.810]  Watering is the main thing you have to do.
[09:59.810 --> 10:06.150]  Supports, lollipopping, twisting, things like that are all bonuses, but they should be done.
[10:06.150 --> 10:09.810]  So I'm just thinking of the minimum things as watering and keeping the light cycle going
[10:09.890 --> 10:12.210]  and just keeping the plants supported and happy.
[10:12.210 --> 10:15.850]  Now with that being said, I want to inspire you to get in there.
[10:15.850 --> 10:16.850]  Remember that.
[10:16.850 --> 10:20.570]  Keep in mind that every day that you don't get up and get in there and do your best in
[10:20.570 --> 10:23.010]  the garden, the harvest will show you.
[10:23.010 --> 10:26.330]  Today you can be as depressed, as down as you want.
[10:26.330 --> 10:29.790]  You could push it off, or you can go in there and kick ass.
[10:29.790 --> 10:33.850]  It's not going to show you until the back end, until you go to cut down at harvest time.
[10:33.850 --> 10:37.310]  You're going to say, man, if I would have gone in there that one day when I was having
[10:37.310 --> 10:40.670]  that problem and I just didn't feel like it, if I would have gone in there and spent
[10:40.670 --> 10:44.950]  one hour in there and just handled this issue, this harvest weight would be better.
[10:44.950 --> 10:47.790]  This harvest quality would be better.
[10:47.790 --> 10:52.390]  This harvest experience overall would be more rewarding and would be more better.
[10:52.390 --> 10:53.390]  More better?
[10:53.390 --> 10:54.390]  Sure, we're going to go with that.
[10:54.390 --> 10:59.890]  And it would be more rewarding for you spiritually and mentally and financially as well.
[10:59.890 --> 11:01.470]  So think about that.
[11:01.470 --> 11:05.210]  That's what I use as inspiration and motivation when I don't want to do any work.
[11:05.210 --> 11:08.690]  If I just go do it, when it's done, I'm going to feel better.
[11:08.690 --> 11:09.970]  That's a reward within itself.
[11:09.970 --> 11:14.990]  And then every little job that you do is a small reward that leads up to the big full
[11:14.990 --> 11:18.730]  accomplishment of the big picture of the goal, which feels very rewarding.
[11:18.730 --> 11:19.730]  I know Tonto.
[11:19.730 --> 11:21.930]  I know that Tonto was a former military person.
[11:21.930 --> 11:23.930]  So I know you know that feeling of accomplishment.
[11:23.930 --> 11:26.090]  I know that you know that feeling of pride.
[11:26.090 --> 11:28.650]  Dig inside and feel that feeling.
[11:28.650 --> 11:30.650]  Compare the feelings inside when you're laying there.
[11:31.210 --> 11:36.810]  Man, I could either lay here and let this depression crush me today or I could get up
[11:36.810 --> 11:40.710]  and crush the depression and go spend time with my plants, which I love, which are like
[11:40.710 --> 11:44.930]  my little children, which put off good vibes, which feed me good energy, which in a few
[11:44.930 --> 11:48.890]  months also is going to give me quality medicine and a big reward.
[11:48.890 --> 11:53.170]  So I should just get up and not let this depression, not let this win today.
[11:53.170 --> 11:54.170]  I understand, dude.
[11:54.170 --> 11:57.930]  I had a traumatic brain injury where for several months I thought about doing terrible shit
[11:57.930 --> 11:58.930]  to myself.
[11:58.930 --> 11:59.930]  I'm cool now, guys.
[12:00.210 --> 12:01.210]  I'm cool.
[12:01.210 --> 12:02.210]  I'm past that, but that was years ago.
[12:02.210 --> 12:03.210]  I do have a traumatic brain injury.
[12:03.210 --> 12:06.050]  When it first happened, I questioned if I would make it to tomorrow.
[12:06.050 --> 12:11.270]  And I understand the lack of desire, the lack of passion, the lack of anything to get up
[12:11.270 --> 12:12.270]  and do anything.
[12:12.270 --> 12:13.430]  I didn't care if I got up and ate.
[12:13.430 --> 12:14.570]  I didn't care if I got up to pee.
[12:14.570 --> 12:18.490]  I thought I was just pissing right there because I was so depressed and so dark that who cares?
[12:18.490 --> 12:19.490]  I just piss on myself anyway.
[12:19.490 --> 12:20.490]  It wouldn't matter.
[12:20.490 --> 12:21.490]  I've been there.
[12:21.490 --> 12:22.970]  You just got to dig deep, man.
[12:22.970 --> 12:26.890]  You got to dig deep inside of yourself and think that your mind is playing tricks on
[12:26.890 --> 12:29.170]  you and that you are the winner of that game.
[12:29.410 --> 12:30.410]  You're going to win every time.
[12:30.410 --> 12:31.410]  Don't let that shit beat you.
[12:31.410 --> 12:37.450]  So the bare minimum is watering, transplanting, supporting, and then after that, everything
[12:37.450 --> 12:38.450]  else is bonus.
[12:38.450 --> 12:41.330]  You got to feed them and you got to change the life cycle, but they will grow.
[12:41.330 --> 12:44.830]  I have friends that leave town for several months at a time because they've got an auto
[12:44.830 --> 12:47.930]  watering system and it just keeps their growth going for them.
[12:47.930 --> 12:51.590]  It will happen, but the more you do to it, the better it will become.
[12:51.590 --> 12:54.370]  And that's what I'm going to say would be the motivating factor.
[12:54.370 --> 12:58.810]  The thing that would get you in there is just knowing like I can grow some C-grade weed.
[12:58.810 --> 13:02.490]  I could do that in my fucking sleep, but if I want to grow A-grade weed, I got to get
[13:02.490 --> 13:03.490]  in there.
[13:03.490 --> 13:04.490]  I got to touch the plants.
[13:04.490 --> 13:05.490]  I got to do the work.
[13:05.490 --> 13:06.490]  That's the difference.
[13:06.490 --> 13:07.610]  I mentioned that in an episode before.
[13:07.610 --> 13:11.210]  That's the difference between A-grade and C-grade weed is just doing the work.
[13:11.210 --> 13:16.170]  Now another thing I should really mention is that I invite you to join my Discord server.
[13:16.170 --> 13:17.170]  This sounds like advertising.
[13:17.170 --> 13:22.410]  This sounds cheesy, but honestly, bro, during these weird times where we were isolated through
[13:22.410 --> 13:26.930]  a pandemic and we had to sit at home and we weren't allowed to go places, Discord is where
[13:27.050 --> 13:32.290]  I spent a lot of time hanging out with some of my best and favorite friends.
[13:32.290 --> 13:35.330]  In my Discord server, we have amazing deep conversations.
[13:35.330 --> 13:36.330]  We are very supportive.
[13:36.330 --> 13:37.650]  We're all grown adults.
[13:37.650 --> 13:38.650]  We're all grown people.
[13:38.650 --> 13:40.210]  There are men and women.
[13:40.210 --> 13:41.210]  There's transgender.
[13:41.210 --> 13:44.610]  There are gay, straight, color, black, white, purple people in there.
[13:44.610 --> 13:49.290]  There's people of all ethnicities, races, genders, orientations.
[13:49.290 --> 13:52.710]  I invite everybody and we have a really good time hanging out in there.
[13:52.710 --> 13:55.490]  If you're feeling down, if you're feeling depressed, if you're feeling alone, if you
[13:55.490 --> 13:59.530]  need some encouragement, if you need a grow buddy just to pep talk you or just someone
[13:59.530 --> 14:04.170]  to be around to get the dark shit out of your brain, come hang out on the Discord server.
[14:04.170 --> 14:08.170]  That's where I go when I'm lonely, bored, need some friends.
[14:08.170 --> 14:11.930]  If my girlfriend's working or if she's asleep because she goes to bed way earlier than me,
[14:11.930 --> 14:15.570]  or if I just need someone to talk me through some shit because I'm a business owner.
[14:15.570 --> 14:16.570]  Sometimes I have challenges.
[14:16.570 --> 14:17.970]  I need to talk to people.
[14:17.970 --> 14:20.210]  Discord is where I go to talk to some of my best friends.
[14:20.210 --> 14:21.210]  Mike's got kids.
[14:21.210 --> 14:22.210]  He's busy.
[14:22.210 --> 14:23.210]  He only goes to bed early.
[14:23.210 --> 14:25.070]  Sometimes the Discord crew is who I turn to.
[14:25.650 --> 14:26.650]  I invite you to do the same thing.
[14:26.650 --> 14:28.310]  A lot of my favorite people are there.
[14:28.310 --> 14:32.850]  So if you're feeling dark, feeling weird, need that encouragement, need some grow bros,
[14:32.850 --> 14:34.250]  come join us on the Discord.
[14:34.250 --> 14:37.770]  That's where I am a lot of the time and I'll be there more.
[14:37.770 --> 14:42.030]  I've made a pledge to kind of be there more often because it got weird and we're fixing
[14:42.030 --> 14:43.390]  it and making the vibe strong.
[14:43.390 --> 14:44.750]  I will be there.
[14:44.750 --> 14:46.390]  No shit heads allowed on Discord.
[14:46.390 --> 14:47.390]  I'm rambling.
[14:47.390 --> 14:50.070]  Tonto, I know that may not be the answer you're looking for, bro.
[14:50.070 --> 14:53.110]  The minimum shit that has to happen is they have to be watered.
[14:53.110 --> 14:54.910]  Other than that, they'll pretty much grow.
[14:54.910 --> 14:57.270]  Feed them, water them, make sure they don't fall over.
[14:57.270 --> 14:58.270]  They're going to do it.
[14:58.270 --> 15:02.190]  But you've got to dig deep and get the motivation and the inspiration to get in there and make
[15:02.190 --> 15:03.790]  those plants champions.
[15:03.790 --> 15:06.950]  I know you don't want to smoke C grade or B grade weed.
[15:06.950 --> 15:10.310]  Remember that when you're feeling down, all you got to do is get in there and do the work
[15:10.310 --> 15:12.590]  and you can make that A grade weed.
[15:12.590 --> 15:14.150]  Just use that as your inspiration.
[15:14.150 --> 15:15.990]  Then reach out, bro.
[15:15.990 --> 15:20.670]  Message me, message the army, join the Discord, get involved with some people, get some brain
[15:20.670 --> 15:23.230]  juices moving, get yourself out of that dark mode.
[15:23.230 --> 15:24.230]  We'll get you in the grow.
[15:24.230 --> 15:25.230]  We'll get you going.
[15:25.230 --> 15:26.230]  All right.
[15:26.230 --> 15:27.230]  There is more to this.
[15:27.230 --> 15:28.230]  It does say second question.
[15:28.230 --> 15:34.270]  I do have hopes and dreams of opening a cannabis nursery within Canada sometime in the next
[15:34.270 --> 15:36.190]  five to 10 years.
[15:36.190 --> 15:42.470]  Nurseries can have up to 50 meters squared or 5,000 or 538 square foot of canopy space.
[15:42.470 --> 15:47.390]  I hope to be selling clones and seeds in the legal market here in Canada.
[15:47.390 --> 15:49.750]  I do have two questions based on this.
[15:49.750 --> 15:53.630]  Are nurseries viable businesses in the States in your opinion?
[15:54.030 --> 15:55.990]  If you have that allotted space, how would you run it?
[15:55.990 --> 15:58.710]  Any advice to someone who may jump into that market?
[15:58.710 --> 16:02.910]  I know that's a very general and broad question.
[16:02.910 --> 16:04.310]  Then there's more.
[16:04.310 --> 16:06.510]  Let's talk about this clone nursery.
[16:06.510 --> 16:11.430]  That is not something that we see completely dedicated to clones here in Colorado.
[16:11.430 --> 16:15.630]  There's not enough of a market in my opinion to just sell clones.
[16:15.630 --> 16:18.810]  There's one company that I know of that focuses on just clones.
[16:18.810 --> 16:23.230]  They seem to do okay, but there's only one company I know of that really does that.
[16:23.230 --> 16:26.690]  There are two different ways that clones kind of work here in Colorado.
[16:26.690 --> 16:31.110]  You can make clones and provide clones for the commercial market, which means you've
[16:31.110 --> 16:33.410]  got a big ... It kind of sounds like what you would try to do.
[16:33.410 --> 16:37.590]  You'd take your big warehouse and you would cut hundreds of clones, maybe thousands of
[16:37.590 --> 16:40.310]  clones, probably hundreds of thousands of clones possibly.
[16:40.310 --> 16:44.910]  Then you would offer those clones to other commercial facilities and they would buy those
[16:44.910 --> 16:47.630]  and then they would just run your cuts in there grow.
[16:47.630 --> 16:51.110]  Many commercial facilities do rely on somebody to provide those clones.
[16:51.110 --> 16:52.910]  They buy them every time.
[16:52.910 --> 16:56.830]  The problem is a lot of facilities will buy clones from you one time.
[16:56.830 --> 16:57.830]  They run all your stuff.
[16:57.830 --> 17:01.110]  They find their favorites and they cut a clone of that and then they never have to buy clones
[17:01.110 --> 17:02.110]  from you again.
[17:02.110 --> 17:05.510]  That's one of the downsides to making clones for the commercial market.
[17:05.510 --> 17:08.630]  Once everybody has their stuff, they just start making their own clones.
[17:08.630 --> 17:10.190]  They don't have to call you anymore.
[17:10.190 --> 17:11.950]  That's kind of how the clone game works.
[17:11.950 --> 17:16.870]  The other option is making clones for the consumer end of the market, which is a great
[17:16.870 --> 17:19.850]  idea, but also there are only so many consumers.
[17:19.850 --> 17:21.590]  People only grow so much weed.
[17:21.630 --> 17:23.670]  I think there are so many rules in Colorado.
[17:23.670 --> 17:26.510]  I'm not even sure if you can sell a clone to somebody from out of state.
[17:26.510 --> 17:29.950]  You may have to have a Colorado ID to even be able to purchase a clone in a store.
[17:29.950 --> 17:34.630]  I don't know that because I've got the ID, so I don't know the steps and skips and caveats
[17:34.630 --> 17:35.630]  to that.
[17:35.630 --> 17:40.790]  But for a while, my dream, and I don't think I'm going to do this anymore so I could talk
[17:40.790 --> 17:45.050]  about it, but there were goals and plans, but I kind of shifted my focus here just because
[17:45.050 --> 17:47.110]  of life and paperwork and things.
[17:47.190 --> 17:52.350]  One of my goals was to open a giant commercial cultivation facility.
[17:52.350 --> 17:57.590]  One of my dreams was to make seeds for the recreational market in Colorado.
[17:57.590 --> 18:01.590]  I wanted to be able to put iRegenetics beans on the shelf here in Colorado.
[18:01.590 --> 18:02.590]  That was one of the goals.
[18:02.590 --> 18:05.950]  That would be great to walk into a store and seed the seeds, but there's so much red tape
[18:05.950 --> 18:08.790]  that it's basically not worth it.
[18:08.790 --> 18:12.830]  I wanted to put seeds on the store shelf, which would have required me to produce those
[18:12.830 --> 18:17.430]  seeds in a commercially licensed grow, which then would have given me the advantage and
[18:17.430 --> 18:21.030]  the ability to sell those clones to commercial grows.
[18:21.030 --> 18:27.310]  So I wanted to sell clones to commercial grows, sell seeds to recreational stores, and at
[18:27.310 --> 18:32.830]  the same time also possibly offer those clones to the recreational stores.
[18:32.830 --> 18:34.470]  That was kind of the goal.
[18:34.470 --> 18:35.910]  Mike and I did a lot of numbers.
[18:35.910 --> 18:36.990]  We did a lot of crunching.
[18:36.990 --> 18:38.990]  It would have barely made any profit.
[18:38.990 --> 18:42.510]  The only way that we think this would have been profitable is if we did a crop where
[18:42.510 --> 18:47.370]  we produced seeds and then sold all the seeds and then did a crop of producing seedless
[18:47.370 --> 18:51.150]  flour and sold the flour to supplement the income.
[18:51.150 --> 18:55.430]  In the meantime, the flour would be building hype for the seeds and be building hype for
[18:55.430 --> 18:56.430]  the clones.
[18:56.430 --> 18:59.390]  Then the clones would be in demand, the seeds would be in demand, and we'd sell more flour
[18:59.390 --> 19:00.390]  and clones.
[19:00.390 --> 19:02.430]  It was kind of hoping to make a cycle out of that.
[19:02.430 --> 19:08.350]  But honestly, it got, with all the licensing fees, the licensing fees basically, and the
[19:08.350 --> 19:11.110]  rules and regulations and all that, it got a little bit ridiculous.
[19:11.110 --> 19:13.870]  We kind of just, I guess we sort of abandoned ship on that idea.
[19:13.870 --> 19:16.350]  I guess things were working the way that they are.
[19:16.350 --> 19:18.030]  Mike had two kids.
[19:18.030 --> 19:21.830]  I retook off the way that it took off and we kind of abandoned ship that way.
[19:21.830 --> 19:29.270]  But just clones, in my opinion, does not look, smell, feel, or seem like a viable option
[19:29.270 --> 19:35.950]  unless you could develop contracts with commercial cultivation facilities that will be relying
[19:35.950 --> 19:40.950]  on you to supply those cuts every, however frequently you need, they need them and you
[19:40.950 --> 19:47.790]  can supply them probably every 90, 75, maybe every 21 days, depending on how they set up
[19:47.790 --> 19:48.790]  their cycles.
[19:48.790 --> 19:49.790]  I ran a big grow.
[19:49.790 --> 19:51.270]  We had three flour rooms.
[19:51.270 --> 19:54.910]  Every 21 days we were cutting clones, putting stuff into flour.
[19:54.910 --> 19:59.130]  It was 21 day flip turnarounds there because we had the rooms divided to where 21 days
[19:59.170 --> 20:01.090]  was the gap in between them.
[20:01.090 --> 20:05.450]  Anyway, if you've got somewhere for those clones to go, it may be a viable business,
[20:05.450 --> 20:10.450]  but without a predetermined customer for that many clones, I don't know you could get that
[20:10.450 --> 20:11.450]  many cuts out.
[20:11.450 --> 20:16.210]  However, I could be wrong because in the great nation of Canada, you guys can mail shit to
[20:16.210 --> 20:17.210]  each other.
[20:17.210 --> 20:18.210]  We can't do that here.
[20:18.210 --> 20:19.650]  We don't have national legalization.
[20:19.650 --> 20:23.550]  We've got state by state legalization and things cannot leave each state.
[20:23.550 --> 20:24.890]  That's highly illegal.
[20:24.890 --> 20:28.770]  So with the advantage in Canada, you can mail things from one end of Canada to the
[20:28.770 --> 20:31.130]  other or in the middle or all over.
[20:31.130 --> 20:36.570]  That may be advantageous to you, but I don't honestly know the clone market in Canada.
[20:36.570 --> 20:42.050]  Again, unless you've got that commercial account or you've got some sort of a commercial availability
[20:42.050 --> 20:45.050]  where you can advertise and say, we'll ship clones everywhere.
[20:45.050 --> 20:48.250]  Then I don't know if it would work with that catch, with that bonus.
[20:48.250 --> 20:51.050]  It may work for you, but I don't want to lead you the wrong direction.
[20:51.050 --> 20:52.050]  All right.
[20:52.050 --> 20:54.870]  I think I rambled on enough about that part of the question.
[20:54.870 --> 20:55.950]  There is more.
[20:55.950 --> 20:57.630]  It says, where was I?
[20:57.630 --> 20:59.250]  I was here.
[20:59.250 --> 21:03.510]  Any other possible events you will be at this year other than the groovy gravy event?
[21:03.510 --> 21:05.550]  Unfortunately, I could not make that one.
[21:05.550 --> 21:06.750]  Yes, I understand.
[21:06.750 --> 21:08.030]  You my friend are Canadian.
[21:08.030 --> 21:12.070]  I understand you could not make the groovy gravy secret stash event in Denver.
[21:12.070 --> 21:17.710]  However, I do not know of any upcoming events in Colorado at this time.
[21:17.710 --> 21:19.710]  There are a few events coming up in other states.
[21:19.710 --> 21:21.550]  I know there's something in Oklahoma.
[21:21.550 --> 21:25.110]  I know there's stuff on the East Coast coming up, but I don't know of anything coming up
[21:25.110 --> 21:26.830]  in Colorado right now.
[21:26.830 --> 21:31.950]  Unfortunately, with a lot of the rule changes, we cannot smoke at any of the events in Colorado.
[21:31.950 --> 21:35.910]  It's basically illegal to consume inside of a public building like that where people are
[21:35.910 --> 21:38.230]  gathering so we can't really smoke.
[21:38.230 --> 21:41.830]  We're either allowed to do business or consume and you don't really get to do both.
[21:41.830 --> 21:42.890]  It's kind of weird.
[21:42.890 --> 21:46.390]  People are opening up consumption places and things like that are changing, but it's taking
[21:46.390 --> 21:47.710]  a little bit of time.
[21:47.710 --> 21:50.810]  However, I do not know of any events coming up in Colorado.
[21:50.810 --> 21:55.990]  If I do, I will let you know, especially of events which I am attending and vending
[21:55.990 --> 21:58.330]  because I like to let the people know where I will be.
[21:58.330 --> 22:02.790]  I love it when people come and meet me, shake my hand, give me a fist bump, say hello, tell
[22:02.790 --> 22:05.970]  me how long they've been listening to the show, show me pictures of their grow.
[22:05.970 --> 22:07.370]  Let me smell the weed they grew.
[22:07.370 --> 22:08.370]  That shit is awesome.
[22:08.370 --> 22:09.370]  I love it.
[22:09.370 --> 22:15.130]  I will definitely let everybody know when there are more events coming up to celebrate
[22:15.130 --> 22:17.570]  and congregate for.
[22:17.570 --> 22:19.450]  Let's see, what else do I have on this message?
[22:19.490 --> 22:23.570]  This one says, I hope all is well from your friend Tonto.
[22:23.570 --> 22:25.530]  Big shout out to my buddy Tonto up there in Canada.
[22:25.530 --> 22:26.890]  Tonto, thank you for the great message.
[22:26.890 --> 22:28.170]  I do appreciate it.
[22:28.170 --> 22:31.930]  If you have any more questions about your clone nursery ideas, I would love to talk
[22:31.930 --> 22:32.930]  to you about that.
[22:32.930 --> 22:34.410]  Send me more Patreon messages.
[22:34.410 --> 22:35.410]  Send me an email.
[22:35.410 --> 22:36.410]  We will be in touch.
[22:36.410 --> 22:38.530]  We will get that dialed in for you if you've got more questions.
[22:38.530 --> 22:41.490]  Again, I don't know the details about the rules up there in Canada.
[22:41.490 --> 22:44.090]  I'm very limited in my clone sales here in Colorado.
[22:44.090 --> 22:50.850]  I could only sell to the Colorado residents and also Colorado commercial production facilities.
[22:50.850 --> 22:53.690]  And then once they've got them, they clone them and they don't buy them very much.
[22:53.690 --> 22:56.130]  So only new grows will be buying clones.
[22:56.130 --> 22:58.610]  You're in Canada where you can ship nationwide.
[22:58.610 --> 23:02.970]  That opens you up to every single Canadian is able to buy clones.
[23:02.970 --> 23:06.130]  I could be completely wrong in my idea that it would not work.
[23:06.130 --> 23:08.730]  You've got a different business plan than I had available.
[23:08.730 --> 23:09.730]  All right.
[23:09.730 --> 23:11.410]  I think that is all I've got for this episode.
[23:11.410 --> 23:12.410]  My voice is burning out.
[23:12.410 --> 23:13.770]  I seem to be quite stuttery.
[23:14.450 --> 23:15.650]  I'm not going to drag this episode out too long.
[23:15.650 --> 23:16.650]  We'll make it a short one.
[23:16.650 --> 23:17.650]  We'll make it a sweet one.
[23:17.650 --> 23:21.730]  That way I can come back and do a better episode in the next show.
[23:21.730 --> 23:25.890]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[23:25.890 --> 23:29.330]  cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there, I want to
[23:29.330 --> 23:32.410]  thank you again for listening to another short episode of the podcast.
[23:32.410 --> 23:33.890]  I do apologize for this being short.
[23:33.890 --> 23:34.890]  I'm stuttery.
[23:34.890 --> 23:37.250]  My voice sounds like shit in my headphones.
[23:37.250 --> 23:38.250]  It's not a good show.
[23:38.250 --> 23:39.250]  I'm going to make it quick.
[23:39.250 --> 23:41.010]  So the next one will be better.
[23:41.010 --> 23:43.170]  Thank you for all the encouragement that will flow in from that.
[23:43.170 --> 23:45.090]  You guys are great people, beautiful community.
[23:45.090 --> 23:46.090]  I thank you.
[23:46.090 --> 23:48.250]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[23:48.250 --> 23:52.410]  If you do feel like this episode was educational, informative, entertaining, maybe you'd like
[23:52.410 --> 23:55.650]  to just send a couple of bucks to encourage me to do a better show next time.

[24:10.170 --> 24:12.570]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy trike man.
[24:12.570 --> 24:16.850]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
