[00:57.400 --> 01:01.360]  with us sitting in front of me is a regular guest, a frequent guest. How many episodes
[01:01.360 --> 01:05.040]  you've been on lately, bro? A bunch in a row, a bunch in a row. Well, thanks for coming
[01:05.040 --> 01:08.160]  back. We got our buddy white Mike over there. What's up everybody? Looking good on Mike
[01:08.160 --> 01:12.440]  too. And sitting to my left is a good friend of mine. I'm actually Doug's medical marijuana
[01:12.440 --> 01:16.400]  caregiver. Uh, welcome to the show. My good buddy, Doug. Thank you very much. I wish we
[01:16.400 --> 01:22.800]  had some crowd noise for that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, thanks for coming Doug. My pleasure.
[01:22.800 --> 01:27.440]  Doug's a good friend of mine. I am his a caregiver and our topic for the show is going to be
[01:27.440 --> 01:33.680]  a, the way that different ways of consuming your cannabinoids, the way of using your cannabis,
[01:33.680 --> 01:37.840]  the way taking your medicine differently affects your mind and your body and maybe even your
[01:37.840 --> 01:42.000]  spirit a little bit differently. Uh, but before we get there, I'm going to brag a little
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.600]  bit. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I know we've been talking about the spot dispensary a whole bunch on
[01:47.600 --> 01:55.600]  this podcast because it's awesome. Mike and I spend 132 hours per week there ish, ish.
[01:55.600 --> 01:59.040]  And it's, it's a great spot to be. It's a great place to be. I think that's what I meant
[01:59.040 --> 02:04.520]  to say. Whatever. It's a great spot to be in. Uh, but anyway, yesterday we were wrapping
[02:04.520 --> 02:08.440]  up work, uh, and the boss walked up to me and he said, mandatory meeting today, five
[02:08.440 --> 02:12.360]  o'clock at the Pueblo convention center. And I smiled and I said, really? And he goes,
[02:12.360 --> 02:16.120]  yeah, I put on your Sundays cause we're in the top three. So we get there and it was
[02:16.120 --> 02:23.040]  the best of Pueblo convention. Um, and our spot won the best dispensary in Pueblo. We
[02:23.040 --> 02:28.160]  took first place. We got the gold. Yep. Anybody can vote. It's a local competition for, I
[02:28.160 --> 02:33.800]  think there were 180 categories this year ranging from like best teacher to best cop
[02:33.880 --> 02:39.880]  to best lawyer, best lawyer, best hairdresser. And we were at one best dispensary. Yep. Best
[02:39.880 --> 02:44.760]  dispensary. So we've got a little gold plaque in the office and we are going to be well advertised.
[02:44.760 --> 02:48.920]  And now we've got something to brag about. And our pictures in the paper today for our picture.
[02:48.920 --> 02:52.520]  Yeah. We have a really cool picture. We took a picture in front of the Bob Marley mural. Nice
[02:52.520 --> 02:57.080]  big team picture. Got everybody out there. That's a colorful shot. Eight in the morning,
[02:57.080 --> 03:00.600]  taking a picture, a bunch of people that work at a dispensary. And for those that weren't aware
[03:00.600 --> 03:04.760]  that you were the best. Now they know, now they know. And we've got a year to brag about that.
[03:04.760 --> 03:09.640]  Yep. One whole year. All right. Well, let's get into the, where I'm done bragging a big shout out
[03:09.640 --> 03:13.000]  to Rob at the spot. Big shout out to the whole team at the spot. Everybody that does everything
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.520]  they do. Uh, the grow team that a bud team, the trimming team, the bud tenting crew, all the
[03:18.520 --> 03:22.120]  managers, everybody that signs a paycheck. It's big shout out to everybody that's involved at the
[03:22.120 --> 03:26.440]  spot. Uh, I like working there. You guys are kick-ass and let's keep kicking ass. You guys.
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.440]  Well done everybody. Yeah. No, let's get off the toot and horn and advertising our work all the
[03:30.440 --> 03:35.640]  time on the show. Not a way we're really here today. Yeah. So these two guys I've been responsible
[03:35.640 --> 03:42.360]  for their medical marijuana for over five years that I can say for sure without a doubt. Yeah.
[03:42.360 --> 03:46.040]  Probably closer. Five or six years. Okay. I was going to say closer to eight or 10, maybe even
[03:47.160 --> 03:50.440]  it's getting there. It's getting there. Okay. Yeah. I don't have a good sense of time.
[03:50.440 --> 03:55.720]  Uh, I honestly do not do that. Honestly. I used to remember time periods by what fish shows I went to.
[03:56.120 --> 04:01.080]  Yeah. I've been to a lot of fish shows. You guys, I used to document, uh, yeah. How much time I was
[04:01.080 --> 04:04.600]  spending places. All right. So I've been responsible for these guys as medical marijuana.
[04:04.600 --> 04:09.320]  And I've noticed that, uh, when Mike wants to get high, he wants to smoke some sativa,
[04:09.320 --> 04:14.120]  like some Jilly bean that we just took dabs of or some golden goat. But when Mike needs medicine,
[04:14.120 --> 04:17.800]  he reaches for the heavy CBD. I got this jar over here. If either one of you would like a
[04:17.800 --> 04:23.880]  dab of this big, crystal clear oil, that's almost pure CBD that was given to me. We're both
[04:23.880 --> 04:30.200]  staring at bars. Yeah. When these guys, excuse me for the cough. When these guys are hurting,
[04:30.200 --> 04:32.680]  uh, when they feel pain, they hit me up and they're like, do you have something
[04:32.680 --> 04:38.600]  extra CBD for me right now? Cause Mike's got sore hands. Uh, Mike's are, Doug was an old railroad
[04:38.600 --> 04:41.880]  worker over here. You got to picture this guy. He's in jeans and a flannel shirt with a big ass
[04:41.880 --> 04:46.200]  knife on his belt. This man looks like he's got a lot of money. He's got a lot of money. He's got
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.960]  this man looks like he is ready to do some work, whatever you need done. I'm sure and confident
[04:51.960 --> 04:56.600]  Doug can handle that work. I would certainly give it a shot. Yeah. I'm sure you'd get it
[04:56.600 --> 05:02.360]  done a little better than myself. Well, you know, maybe depending on what it was. That's true. That
[05:02.360 --> 05:06.360]  is true. There are some things that I bet I could do, but, uh, Doug's a confident man. He can work,
[05:06.360 --> 05:09.880]  but he's an old railroad guy. And so he's pretty much broken all over the place,
[05:09.880 --> 05:15.000]  broken all over the place. Yeah. Back knees, all the joints, all the joints are in bad shape.
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.920]  And so that AGE has got a little bit to do with it. You know? Yeah. Well, yeah,
[05:18.920 --> 05:21.560]  you're getting a little bit up there. Do you mind if I ask you how old you are on the show,
[05:21.560 --> 05:26.680]  my friend? Not at all. I'm 61 years old. So my friend Doug is 61 and medical cannabis is
[05:26.680 --> 05:32.200]  keeping this dude moving, but he hurts. We give him some CBD. Um, do you have a family? We're
[05:32.200 --> 05:37.000]  just going to kind of jump into this part. Do you have a favorite way to consume your CBD medicine?
[05:37.960 --> 05:45.800]  Um, my, my favorite way to consume is with my little electric pin. Okay. Uh, my old lady calls
[05:45.800 --> 05:50.280]  it the pacifier because it's always around my neck. It's hanging on your neck on a lanyard.
[05:50.280 --> 05:54.040]  You never know when you're going to need it. And it's one of the most resin coated
[05:55.720 --> 06:00.040]  you can tell that that thing has been around the block. Well, you know, it had to have a little,
[06:00.040 --> 06:06.040]  uh, extra work done to it because those glass tops just don't work for me. Oh yeah. I know how
[06:06.040 --> 06:11.000]  you get been a little modified there. That's pretty it's custom, but it, but it works really
[06:11.000 --> 06:18.760]  good. It's a, they're at a moment's notice. Okay. And, uh, it's the way I, that seems to,
[06:19.320 --> 06:23.480]  well, anytime you smoke it, we all know that, that that's the quickest way to get it. Yes.
[06:24.200 --> 06:31.240]  And when you're in pain and you want relief now, I find that's the quickest way. So what's going
[06:31.240 --> 06:34.440]  to hurt most frequently if we're hanging out, what are you going to say? Shit, this hurts.
[06:34.440 --> 06:39.080]  What are you going to grab first? My hip, your hip, my hip, my lower back. Okay. So then you're
[06:39.080 --> 06:42.680]  probably going to say shit that hurts. Second thought is going to be where's my vape pen,
[06:42.680 --> 06:47.720]  right? Exactly. How long from inhaling off? Okay. First of all, how many rips off that pen does it
[06:47.720 --> 06:53.000]  take to kind of give you a little relief to notice some e easing of the pain to notice easing of the
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.160]  pain? I felt like a doctor as I asked probably within two or three, two or three rips off the
[06:57.160 --> 07:02.680]  vape. Tell you the truth. I'd like the truth holding. You're not under oath or anything.
[07:02.680 --> 07:07.560]  Holding the damn thing in my hand and knowing that I'm about to take a hit off of it starts
[07:07.560 --> 07:15.640]  the process right there because I know relief is on its way, is on its way. And I think I've told
[07:15.640 --> 07:24.680]  you this before your definition of what a painkiller is. We know that CBDs help control pain,
[07:24.680 --> 07:35.480]  but marijuana in general changes your outlook on pain. Okay. So I agree completely. I think it's,
[07:36.920 --> 07:42.280]  and what is pain relief? I mean, that's what, that's what painkillers do is they, well,
[07:43.160 --> 07:47.640]  we know that there there's chemicals that go in and shut down certain receptors.
[07:48.760 --> 07:52.920]  Maybe, uh, maybe the THC part is making you forget that you hurt and helping your mind go to a
[07:52.920 --> 07:57.800]  better place instead of being focused on that hip and that lower back going out on you and hurting.
[07:57.800 --> 08:02.840]  Okay. Right. Okay. So two or three rips and you start feeling that forgetting about the pain and
[08:02.840 --> 08:10.200]  a little bit of pain going away. Yes. How long does that take? You can try it if you want, if you want
[08:10.200 --> 08:14.840]  to take two or three rips. It's in my mouth. And once it gets into the hand, it's sort of, yeah,
[08:14.840 --> 08:19.800]  once it's in the hand, okay. So it starts right then immediately within about two or three rips,
[08:19.800 --> 08:25.000]  which only takes, you know, 30 seconds. Yeah. Okay. So, but so within a minute, you're in a
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.400]  minute able to go back to doing whatever you needed to do. Take care of the kid, water the dog,
[08:29.400 --> 08:33.480]  yeah. Walk the dog. Like I see you walk, he's got a dog that needs a lot of walking. So I see you
[08:33.480 --> 08:39.480]  walking with buddy quite frequently. Shout out to buddy, the dog. Yeah, good boy. That's a good guy.
[08:39.480 --> 08:44.040]  Yeah. So within 30 seconds now, if you were to take, and I won't even ask any about, about any
[08:44.040 --> 08:48.200]  pharmaceuticals that I know you take, but if you were to take a pharmaceutical to treat that pain,
[08:48.200 --> 08:52.840]  Oh no, 20 minutes, 20 minutes. You know, if you're lucky and then what are the side effects?
[08:52.840 --> 08:58.280]  Oh, well, he just leaned back into his chair. Like, well, you got all day and we do. So
[08:58.840 --> 09:07.000]  take your time. Opioids, right. Which is the major ones. Okay. Um, anywhere from the dry mouth
[09:07.560 --> 09:13.800]  to a listless feeling to constipation. Okay. And then they have to give you another medicine for
[09:13.800 --> 09:18.760]  that. Don't they? Exactly. Well, that's their, that's the way they do medicine anymore at all.
[09:18.760 --> 09:23.240]  Absolutely. Okay. You know, they barely want to touch you anymore. It's just prescribe another
[09:23.240 --> 09:30.920]  medication and see how that works. You want Skype? And then I'm serious. No, I know that I've done
[09:30.920 --> 09:36.520]  that before. I will never do that again. Uh, Skyping with your doctor is not a good thing.
[09:36.520 --> 09:39.880]  No, I want my doctor to touch me. Yeah. Well, you, you know, you'd like to be able to look
[09:39.880 --> 09:45.880]  around the room and see the diplomas. I could be sitting there with just a shirt on because that's,
[09:45.880 --> 09:49.800]  you know, that's all you see. It's not like you can look around and you're like, you know,
[09:49.800 --> 09:54.920]  there's interaction between humans that doesn't happen on Skype. Absolutely. Right. Absolutely.
[09:54.920 --> 10:00.440]  Especially someone from your generation. Skype is probably fucking fangled technology for you. Yeah.
[10:00.440 --> 10:06.600]  Yeah. I try to keep current, but Skype, we don't expect you to be that current. I was periscoping
[10:06.600 --> 10:09.960]  earlier. You guys, and Doug had no idea what was happening for the first 30 seconds of that
[10:09.960 --> 10:15.160]  periscope video. No, no. I was looking around the room like, what's he talking to? I actually said,
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.640]  I'm going to periscope for a minute. Yeah. Right. All right. So we'll get back on topic here. So
[10:19.640 --> 10:23.720]  within 30 seconds to a minute, you're feeling relief from the CBD, your pain and your hip
[10:23.720 --> 10:27.320]  isn't hurting, but 20 minutes, if you take some medicine and dude also thanks a lot for getting,
[10:27.320 --> 10:30.600]  let me get so personal, ask about your medicine and tell me about your side effects and shit.
[10:30.600 --> 10:36.840]  That's kind of deep compared to taking pills. And I don't see why we can't grow our own. Why
[10:36.840 --> 10:40.280]  they don't want us to grow our own medicine when this dude can feel better in 20 minutes
[10:40.280 --> 10:44.840]  from taking a rip off of a vape pen. Well, it's money, but it works so well. Like I like what you
[10:44.840 --> 10:50.200]  say. It is money. If cannabis didn't do half of what it does, like it would be legal. Like if we
[10:50.200 --> 10:54.200]  discovered it right now, it would be celebrated everywhere. Someone should print that on a shirt.
[10:54.200 --> 10:59.400]  If cannabis didn't do half of what it does, it wouldn't, it would be illegal. Yeah. Yeah. That's
[10:59.800 --> 11:05.880]  if it, if it just worked as medicine, if we could just replace, you know, cotton with it, like all
[11:05.880 --> 11:10.920]  the pharmaceuticals, we could just do one replaced by it. Yep. I don't know about all like there's
[11:10.920 --> 11:15.400]  still use for plenty of what pharma has to offer. It's just cannabis replaces a lot of what we're
[11:15.400 --> 11:23.000]  using it at a pharma inappropriately for now. You bet. Look, uh, anyone that's taking Vicodin
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.800]  realizes that we Colorado just upped the uptake from, I think, uh, uh, grade two or grade three
[11:29.800 --> 11:35.880]  to a grade two narcotic. So there's no refills. You have to go to your doctor. You have to get a
[11:35.880 --> 11:43.400]  hard script from them and walk it to your pharmacy. It has to be filled out on a certain day. It's,
[11:44.440 --> 11:49.160]  it's incredible. And then, and the reason is because of the incredible losses that we've had
[11:49.160 --> 11:54.520]  of life due to overdosing. Right. And it's on the streets everywhere. It's easier sometimes to find
[11:54.520 --> 11:59.080]  stupid drugs and pills than it is to find weed. And before we had dispensaries, we've got dispensaries,
[11:59.080 --> 12:03.880]  we could find the weed, but back in the day it you'd run into other drugs and can't find the
[12:03.880 --> 12:09.640]  weed. Right. Yeah. And it's not that hard. It's actually, it would be easier for me to get some
[12:09.640 --> 12:14.360]  of this medication on the street than it is from the doctor anymore. And then that's what unfortunately
[12:14.360 --> 12:18.040]  results to in heroin use when you can't get those pills anymore from your insurance company,
[12:18.760 --> 12:21.960]  your doctor being unavailable, then you're going to have to go and not, I know you wouldn't do it.
[12:21.960 --> 12:25.080]  You're an older dude. You've got a strong mind and we'll keep you medicated with good weed.
[12:25.080 --> 12:29.000]  But other folks that don't have good weed and a good caregiver and a good family like yourself,
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.720]  they would have to go to the street and get something because their body hurts. They're
[12:31.720 --> 12:36.520]  sick from not having their pills. That's how it happens. All 50 States are facing an increase in
[12:36.520 --> 12:42.760]  heroin use right now. And that's exactly why is regular folk get hurt. They go to the doctor,
[12:42.760 --> 12:47.480]  the doctor throws opiates at them. They take the pill until their bone's not broken anymore. And
[12:47.480 --> 12:52.120]  by the time they're healed, they're now addicted to whatever painkiller they were on. Right.
[12:52.840 --> 12:57.400]  So now they got to go find it. Eventually they get cut off or it becomes too expensive and they
[12:57.400 --> 13:01.400]  turn to heroin. Get some help. If you need help, you guys, that's what I'm saying.
[13:02.520 --> 13:06.280]  And feel free to tell the doctor, no, you don't need pain pills. Like sometimes you need pain
[13:06.280 --> 13:10.840]  pills. I'm not saying people don't cause I've used them many, many times, but I mean like when
[13:10.840 --> 13:15.400]  I broke my finger, I had to refuse pain meds six different times. I kept asking if the pain was
[13:15.400 --> 13:21.640]  going to get any worse. And they kept looking at me like I was insane. What the hell is that noise?
[13:22.200 --> 13:26.280]  Oh, it's a phone on the table. That was so weird. It's Doug's phone. Oh, it's all right.
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.640]  It vibrates stupid loud. Serious vibrate. I thought it was the music in the show. I was like,
[13:31.640 --> 13:35.560]  what is happening? I just couldn't figure it out. No problem. No worries at all. Um, all right. So
[13:35.560 --> 13:38.840]  Mike, I would ask you the same question kind of that I was asking Doug, since we, uh, we're got
[13:38.840 --> 13:43.640]  off track here and I need to find a good launching spot. Um, can I ask what your medical condition is
[13:43.640 --> 13:46.200]  that you smoke for? And you don't have to go too into detail if you don't feel like it.
[13:46.200 --> 13:52.760]  Uh, the short version version is I damaged my neck and, uh, never had cartilage in my knees.
[13:52.760 --> 13:57.080]  And so I need something that helps with inflammation and nerve generated pain
[13:57.880 --> 14:03.160]  and cannabis works wonderfully where most of the drugs available on the pharmaceutical market
[14:03.160 --> 14:08.440]  don't do anything for nerve generated pain. No. So how long, if you took a, what's your
[14:08.440 --> 14:15.080]  preferred method of smoking? Um, right now, uh, dabbing. Yeah. We've currently upgraded.
[14:15.080 --> 14:19.720]  We've currently upgraded Mike smoking status until about a month or two ago. It was flowers.
[14:19.720 --> 14:26.440]  He was a heavy flower smoker in a pipe, right? Yep. Piping flowers or bong and, uh,
[14:26.440 --> 14:31.000]  bong and flowers. If I had a bong handy, but I broke my beautiful bong a while ago,
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.560]  rest in peace, bong. Yep. And have just been piping it for a long time. Um,
[14:36.440 --> 14:39.640]  and then recently upgraded to an oil rig and a nice nail and a torch. And
[14:40.280 --> 14:43.960]  I've been doing a lot of dabs lately, but flowers are still sort of my first love.
[14:43.960 --> 14:48.280]  Mike showed up with some delicious Jilly bean hash today. A big shout out for that right on.
[14:48.280 --> 14:53.560]  Thank you. That's delicious. Yeah. That tastes fucking hella good and I'm high as
[14:54.600 --> 15:01.080]  but honestly, the most common way I consume these days is with tincture. Really? Um, I do,
[15:02.040 --> 15:10.040]  uh, three milliliters of synergy, which is a half THC, half CBD, um, tincture compound. That's
[15:10.920 --> 15:15.960]  really, really low dose. Um, and I take it sort of as a preventative morning and evening
[15:15.960 --> 15:22.600]  to help keep the inflammation down before it gets bad. Um, and that seems to work wonders for my
[15:22.680 --> 15:31.560]  knees and for my back. What did those costs for a customer? Uh, 40, uh, 40 bucks before tax for
[15:31.560 --> 15:37.880]  a hundred milligrams total. So for me, that's a week's worth of meds. Okay. Wow. Okay. 40 bucks
[15:37.880 --> 15:42.840]  for a week worth of meds. Yep. You get 30 doses per bottle and I'm taking six a day. So it's not
[15:42.840 --> 15:48.600]  even a seven day week for me. It's a five day week for me. All right. Dang. Okay. So it's worth
[15:48.600 --> 15:54.280]  it for 40 bucks. Uh, I was paying more when I was just taking pills. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Pills are
[15:54.280 --> 15:58.520]  expensive. Yep. Yeah. Even if you've just got a copay or something, pills, I was just doing a
[15:58.520 --> 16:03.000]  copay and it was still 90 bucks a week. I got some Vicodin's when I got some wisdom teeth pulled
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.920]  and going to get those was like 14 bucks for like seven pills. And that was the generic shit. And
[16:06.920 --> 16:10.120]  I was like, well, I don't even really need them. Why do I want to throw down a bunch of money for
[16:10.120 --> 16:16.120]  pills? I don't need. When I stopped taking pills, I was on two different pain medications. Um,
[16:16.120 --> 16:21.320]  neither of them were opiates, uh, but neither of them worked for shit either. And then I was
[16:21.320 --> 16:25.960]  on a third med to help cope with some of the side effects from the first two. Of course. And when I
[16:25.960 --> 16:33.720]  started smoking regularly, um, and first got access to CBD flower, um, I, I didn't have a need for the
[16:33.720 --> 16:37.800]  pills at all the next day. So I just didn't take them one day and then I didn't take them the next
[16:37.800 --> 16:43.240]  day either. Nice. So now you're drug free. Well, except for cannabis, you're drug free, bro. I
[16:43.240 --> 16:47.720]  don't think cannabis is like a drug. That's a plant, man. That's a plant, man. Totally a drug.
[16:50.360 --> 16:53.880]  It's just a very good one. Yep. Very healthy. You don't do any hard drugs.
[16:54.680 --> 16:58.360]  All right. So how long, how long does those go ahead? Don't get something to say on here.
[16:58.360 --> 17:01.640]  Well, no, I was just interested in what he was saying, but I was thinking
[17:01.640 --> 17:07.320]  while he was saying that, that, um, since I'm primarily using concentrates now,
[17:07.880 --> 17:16.350]  uh, gotten completely off of two narcotic medications that I was getting through my doctor.
[17:16.350 --> 17:22.270]  Wow. Uh, from smoking concentrates on a daily basis, smoking concentrates on a daily basis.
[17:22.270 --> 17:24.270]  How long, uh, how often do you smoke?
[17:25.710 --> 17:36.840]  Um, probably starting within an hour after I wake. Okay. Well just, yeah. Cause you got to keep the
[17:36.840 --> 17:39.960]  pain away before it sets in. Right. Yeah. So you get a headstart on the pain and then
[17:40.680 --> 17:46.200]  throughout the day, it's not like a sit down smoke fest for me. It's, it's just,
[17:46.760 --> 17:49.800]  you've got the pacifier hanging on your neck. So you got it right around my neck.
[17:49.800 --> 17:53.720]  You can just grab it and take a couple of rips. And as I'm going on my merry way,
[17:53.720 --> 17:59.080]  it happens to be, that's one of the things I really like about my pen. Um, I find myself
[17:59.080 --> 18:03.800]  using it when I get home between like walking in the door from work and then like getting the
[18:03.800 --> 18:07.480]  dogs taken care of, getting the kid taken care of, getting dinner around, getting the,
[18:07.480 --> 18:11.640]  you know, checking in with the other family members and seeing how their day went. Like,
[18:11.640 --> 18:15.160]  I've got shit to do. I don't have time to sit down and take a dab and put my feet up.
[18:15.160 --> 18:19.000]  And the single life is pretty great, isn't it? Yeah. The single life's fucking beautiful.
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.120]  I've got the email on and shit. It's ready to go. There's like four rigs on the table to hit. Okay.
[18:24.120 --> 18:28.600]  I can't have this kitchen set up. I had four 14 year olds walk into my house at three 30 today,
[18:28.600 --> 18:33.080]  like looking for a place to spend an hour and a half. I know that feeling.
[18:34.040 --> 18:38.600]  And then if you let them, you know, it becomes a permanent roosting place. Oh yeah.
[18:38.600 --> 18:43.720]  For a half hour every day. All right. Um, so how much, how much hash,
[18:43.720 --> 18:46.520]  uh, how long does a grandma hash last you? That's what I think I want to ask. Okay.
[18:46.520 --> 18:48.520]  Grandma hash last me.
[18:51.880 --> 18:57.080]  Three, maybe four days tops. Okay. So you're getting down on about a quarter
[18:57.960 --> 19:01.560]  gram of good quality. You guys, this is the same hash that I smoke. This is Doug gets the hash
[19:01.560 --> 19:05.720]  that I smoke. When I get a slab, uh, I break some off and it goes to Doug's direction. Every time I
[19:05.720 --> 19:10.280]  know when Doug needs hash, I've got him kind of on a good schedule. And yeah, so I tried to get
[19:10.280 --> 19:14.200]  mine around the same time and we all, I get, he gets the same shit that I get. He smokes what I
[19:14.200 --> 19:18.680]  smoke. You guys. So he's smoking top quality shatter. Uh, sometimes it's wax. If others good
[19:18.680 --> 19:22.200]  wax around, but it's usually top quality snapping, but it's usually top quality snapping.
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.320]  Sometimes it's wax. If others good wax around, but it's usually top quality snap and general
[19:27.320 --> 19:32.920]  type shatter. Yeah. Shatter garden of Weeden shatter 90% of the time or the turpex boys
[19:32.920 --> 19:37.000]  or the turpex boys, which is also very good. There we go. So he's smoking the same stuff as
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  me about a quarter gram a day through a vape pen to keep himself medicated. And you guys,
[19:41.000 --> 19:47.160]  you can get that, uh, at a medical dispensary. It's going to be 30, 35 bucks at a rec shop. Mike,
[19:47.160 --> 19:52.440]  how much is a gram of turpex Ashland to cost us? 50 plus tax comes to 58 change at the door.
[19:52.440 --> 19:58.840]  Yeah. Like about, yeah. 55, 58 bucks. I think 58 bucks. And if you don't think that scares
[19:58.840 --> 20:04.840]  all of us that are on medical marijuana, that C dispensary is changing from just medical to
[20:04.840 --> 20:11.480]  medical and recreational and then possibly to just recreational, uh, you're wrong. It does.
[20:11.480 --> 20:15.080]  Oh, I see it. Yeah. I'm going to do my best to keep taking care of you. That's why you guys are
[20:16.040 --> 20:20.840]  here. I'm actually going to take Doug to renew his medical marijuana card on Wednesday. We keep
[20:20.840 --> 20:27.800]  up on that kind of shit. You can find rec cash in a range of prices between like 25 and 30 gram up to
[20:28.680 --> 20:36.680]  90 a gram here locally. Um, but it's not always quality. No, there's still a lot of real mediocre
[20:36.680 --> 20:41.560]  amateur product on the market right now. Cause we're, our, even our legal market doesn't have
[20:41.560 --> 20:46.920]  all of the things in place that it should. Quality standards are still a little lax.
[20:46.920 --> 20:51.800]  Oh yeah. We're a little off topic, but did you buy any of the live wax from the spot? The TR
[20:51.800 --> 20:56.680]  concentrates? I have not purchased any, but I have consumed some. I would like a review of that.
[20:56.680 --> 21:02.440]  Stupendous. Stupendous. That's all I needed. Stupendous. One word that works for me. Um,
[21:03.240 --> 21:07.000]  just the word. I got some of the star dog. We've got half a dozen flavors on the shelf now,
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.440]  but I got some of the star dog and it was incredible. Guys. I may be investigating,
[21:10.440 --> 21:15.400]  investing in some of this shit. I just, the night I dropped my rig, um, I got to try it.
[21:15.400 --> 21:19.800]  And so that was the consolation. 10 minutes later while I was mourning the loss of my original rig,
[21:20.520 --> 21:25.480]  um, I got to hit some, what was 98 gram is now 75 a gram hash.
[21:26.600 --> 21:31.080]  Very cool. Yep. Very cool. I may step in there after, after I work tomorrow and grab some of
[21:31.080 --> 21:37.240]  that and then a couple other things. All right. Call me if you do. Hell yeah. Um, all right. So
[21:37.240 --> 21:42.120]  I asked Doug how quickly it works, how he consumes it and how much of it he uses. Now I want to jump
[21:42.120 --> 21:45.560]  to Mike. We've talked about how he's using tinctures. I want to ask about when you've
[21:45.560 --> 21:48.760]  been dabbing lately, how many dabs does it take for you to feel relief?
[21:51.320 --> 21:59.160]  One to feel relief to, to kind of push the pain down to where it's sort of like your
[21:59.160 --> 22:03.480]  toe itches. It's no longer something of, um, it's something you're aware of, but it's not
[22:03.480 --> 22:06.920]  something of importance. Right. And that's how I feel after work is right there. That feeling,
[22:06.920 --> 22:11.880]  that's where I started out with pain. Usually about three of what I think of as Mike size
[22:11.880 --> 22:17.960]  dabs, which are fairly small dabs. Okay. Um, he does about a, after a third day, yeah,
[22:17.960 --> 22:23.320]  I was going to say maybe 0.1 a dab, maybe even a little less than that sometimes.
[22:23.960 --> 22:30.120]  Uh, but after about three, like there's some intoxication and like a lot more fun going on
[22:30.120 --> 22:35.880]  than, than just medical effect. But that first dabs all just turning the pain down from a five
[22:36.600 --> 22:41.160]  down into the one or a two range. All right. So two and a half dabs would be cool, but you take
[22:41.160 --> 22:44.600]  that number three, cause you can't take a half dab. Right. And then, uh, then there's some,
[22:45.720 --> 22:50.920]  then there's some intoxication going on. All right. Um, but, but you can handle six or eight
[22:50.920 --> 22:55.880]  dabs. Yeah. I can sit here and take eight or 10 and still be coherent. I'll just be
[22:56.920 --> 23:01.640]  stoned. Yeah. Just stoned and a little giddy. All right. So let's get to the, uh, the synergy
[23:01.640 --> 23:07.160]  drops that you've been taken. Um, you said you take three milliliters, how often?
[23:08.200 --> 23:13.640]  Three milliliters in the morning and the three at night. And the dosing is 1.7 milligrams
[23:14.280 --> 23:22.760]  of THC and CBD per milliliter. So if I remember this, I'm taking about 5.8 milligrams of each
[23:22.760 --> 23:27.400]  in the morning. And then in the evening, now I could drink the whole a hundred milligram bottle.
[23:27.400 --> 23:33.160]  So 50 milligrams of both it just drink it down like a shot or a chug like a beer and not get
[23:33.160 --> 23:38.040]  much intoxication from it. But if I take it in small doses in the morning and the evening,
[23:38.040 --> 23:42.920]  it feels like my knees never get to the point where they're really swollen and stiff and achy.
[23:42.920 --> 23:48.600]  Okay. And my neck never gets to the point where it's just a solid bar of muscle cramped up trying
[23:48.600 --> 23:52.920]  to protect those vertebrae that are squeezing nervous nerve stems going down that arm.
[23:52.920 --> 23:58.200]  All right. And you guys, I feel like my mic is really hot. I'm sorry. Um, part of what,
[23:58.200 --> 24:04.600]  why they're doing the THC CBD combo is I believe that you need both cannabinoids to get into your
[24:04.600 --> 24:08.680]  bloodstream to work together, to hit the mind a little bit, to take your mind off of things,
[24:08.680 --> 24:14.840]  to work on the, the THC hits the nerve pain. I think, uh, the CBD goes for the, like the swollen
[24:14.840 --> 24:21.000]  stuff. Uh, I think together you don't get super high from it. You don't feel much high from the
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.680]  CBD, THC 50, 50 combo because the CBD really feels like it calms down the high.
[24:26.680 --> 24:33.160]  It does. It's a, there's research into that CBD keeps the THC high from being quite a psychoactive.
[24:33.800 --> 24:39.720]  So the CBD helps kind of tone it down. There's, I've heard people carry CBD pills from time to
[24:39.720 --> 24:44.200]  time when there's going to be extreme consumption going on, just in case anybody goes a little
[24:44.200 --> 24:48.520]  overboard, they've got sort of a comedown lever that they can pull. So if your girlfriend takes
[24:48.520 --> 24:53.240]  a big dab and can't handle her shit, you just give her a CBD dab and she'll relax a little
[24:53.240 --> 24:59.400]  in theory. In theory, I hope so. Let's try it. Or somebody doesn't read the label and eats the
[24:59.400 --> 25:03.720]  whole candy bar. Oh man. Never did it before. Man. No, then you just want to leave them alone
[25:03.720 --> 25:09.000]  and not give them any more cannabinoids. Just give them some cartoons and some good food.
[25:09.000 --> 25:16.840]  Make them a sandwich. A sandwich. Yeah. All right. So, uh, how much does the synergy cost?
[25:17.400 --> 25:21.320]  40 a bottle. Well, I already asked you that. Yeah. Okay. And it lasts you a week?
[25:21.320 --> 25:26.120]  Uh, five days. Five days. All right. And Doug's plant pan. If you go to a dispensary,
[25:26.120 --> 25:33.480]  it's going to be 40, 45, 30, maybe 25. If you can hunt and find like member pricing and you get that
[25:33.480 --> 25:41.320]  first time shopper. There's a couple that I I've seen advertise it on certain days at certain times,
[25:41.320 --> 25:45.400]  right. I'll have a special or something. Yeah. Wax Wednesday or some shit. Something like that.
[25:46.280 --> 25:52.680]  But I've never been able to find a constant quality like you deliver.
[25:52.680 --> 25:58.200]  Right. Well, that's the garden of Whedon. So, um, I, the difference between a good caregiver
[25:58.200 --> 26:04.440]  and a bad caregiver is being sort of hammered out on this show. I wish that I did not have to
[26:04.440 --> 26:09.160]  charge Doug anything for the, uh, the hash that he consumes, but it doesn't always come from me.
[26:09.160 --> 26:13.160]  So I have to go get it. So I have to just relay it. And I don't make a penny off of my, my
[26:13.160 --> 26:17.480]  caregiverness for people like people that I am their caregiver. I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[26:17.480 --> 26:21.400]  I don't make any money off of those people. I do not do that. Doug stays pretty well medicated.
[26:21.400 --> 26:26.280]  Yes, I do. Yes, he does. He's got some flow right now. Yes, I do. Got some nice flow. Yeah.
[26:26.280 --> 26:29.720]  Very tasty. I'll have some white widow in a couple of few days. So will Mike,
[26:29.720 --> 26:36.760]  Mike just looked at me like, huh? You know, I have that ever so often craving for the flower.
[26:36.760 --> 26:41.480]  Just, uh, you know, I, I'm a dad. Okay. Well, it's a, I fucking going to jump into this one.
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.320]  I take fat dabs. You guys, uh, my knees hurt. My knees fucking hurt. If you guys were ever near me
[26:45.320 --> 26:48.840]  and hear me bend over or just crouch down, my knees sound like shotgun. You can't be as tall
[26:48.840 --> 26:52.920]  as we are and not have any issues. Yeah, I think so. I think that's true. Cause my knees get wobbly
[26:52.920 --> 26:57.720]  sometimes when I'm tired, like they just get like shaky and my hips hurt. And then, uh, I've got
[26:57.720 --> 27:01.640]  some stomach issues, you guys, and not a lot of, but my stomach sucks. I've got some stomach problems,
[27:01.640 --> 27:07.880]  but so I take fat, fat dabs. You guys, I take, um, some more between 0.3 and 0.5. I like to smoke
[27:07.880 --> 27:13.240]  about a gram and a half a hash a day. Um, I do that in about three sessions throughout the day.
[27:13.240 --> 27:17.240]  I'll take about one dab in the morning, right? When like, not right. When I get up and get
[27:17.240 --> 27:21.320]  myself, I like get up, get the morning shower and get dressed right before I leave. I'll take one
[27:21.320 --> 27:26.360]  dab just so that I'm kind of crispy when I'm getting where I'm going at lunchtime. Uh, I may
[27:26.360 --> 27:31.560]  get a little dab, like about a 0.3 and then do it, bro. Take some of that CBD oil. And then after work,
[27:31.560 --> 27:36.520]  I'll come home and take like a 0.5. And then, uh, before the show I did about a 0.5. And then later
[27:36.520 --> 27:41.160]  on in the evening before bed, I'll just drop like another 0.5 instead of taking 30 dabs throughout
[27:41.160 --> 27:45.800]  the day. I take like six or seven of them, I guess, maybe three to six fat dabs throughout the day.
[27:46.360 --> 27:52.440]  And that keeps me well medicated. Uh, it's expensive, but since I'm the, I, I produce it
[27:52.440 --> 27:57.240]  myself mostly like that part, or I get it from Spence, garden of Whedon kind of guys. I don't
[27:57.240 --> 28:00.520]  know if I should be saying that much on the show, but, uh, since the garden of Whedon can supply us
[28:00.520 --> 28:04.760]  with quality hash and dispensaries, I work at a shop that can supply me with quality hash.
[28:04.760 --> 28:08.040]  And then I go to a medical shop and buy a bunch of shit all the time, but,
[28:08.040 --> 28:12.920]  uh, I smoke a lot and I stay well medicated. I like to eat edibles, but they hit me hard,
[28:12.920 --> 28:18.120]  hard had edibles hit you. Yeah. They hit me hard too, but it's because you're consuming
[28:18.120 --> 28:23.960]  a hundred percent of it is staying within your body. You're not blowing out 35% of what you just
[28:23.960 --> 28:30.200]  took in. Right. Okay. So it takes a little longer. Uh, the rush is a little different the way that
[28:30.200 --> 28:36.440]  it feels when it starts to get into your bloodstream. I feel like it comes on slower,
[28:36.440 --> 28:43.000]  but hits a lot harder. Yeah, I do too. I can more of a body feeling. How did you do that? Did you
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.040]  take some CBD oil and some of the Jilly bean? Yeah, I use the CBD oil to keep the Jilly bean
[28:48.040 --> 28:54.680]  wax stuck to the dabber. Prepare to hear me cough like a sissy girl. Yeah, that's going to work
[28:54.680 --> 28:58.680]  oddly, but I trust you with it. Please don't burn self or microphone.
[29:01.320 --> 29:04.680]  Mike's playing with the email cord and the dab rig and the microphone on his face.
[29:05.480 --> 29:10.600]  It looks like the pothead Olympics. Yeah. Some kind of stoner obstacle course management,
[29:10.600 --> 29:16.040]  bitches, cord management. Yeah. On the other side. All right. Cause I want to ask him when
[29:16.040 --> 29:20.120]  he gets done coughing, I'm going to ask him about how he likes edibles and how they work for him.
[29:20.120 --> 29:25.640]  But Doug, you were talking earlier about how medicine just totally helps your like
[29:25.640 --> 29:32.280]  psychological whole thing. Do you need a sativa or does a CBD medicine get to your head a little
[29:32.280 --> 29:36.840]  bit as well? When you smoke the Tora Bora, the Tora Bora is really high in CBD, so we can use
[29:36.840 --> 29:42.760]  that as a specific plan. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And I really liked the Tora Bora. Shout out to DNA
[29:42.760 --> 29:48.920]  genetics for breeding it and a shout out to the person. They got me a cut. There we go. Yeah. It,
[29:50.920 --> 29:57.880]  it, you can tell between different strains, even with some that say they are the same strain,
[29:59.000 --> 30:06.520]  different ways that it affects you as you're, as you're ingesting it, you know, some more mentally
[30:06.520 --> 30:11.880]  than physically. So you kind of forget about the pain before the relief of the pain. And sometimes
[30:11.880 --> 30:17.080]  just the opposite. All right. The Tora Bora is more of relief of the pain and then the mental
[30:17.080 --> 30:22.360]  aspect. So it comes in, knocks out the pain and then later on it gets you high. Yeah. All right.
[30:22.360 --> 30:26.280]  Okay. So I don't smoke a lot of the CBD stuff. You guys, it doesn't do much for me. So these
[30:26.280 --> 30:30.440]  guys get all the CBD products that I get. I was gifted that hash. If Doug wants a dab of that
[30:30.440 --> 30:34.280]  one, give him a dab of that one too, Mike. Make sure Doug gets some CBD. I'll give a shot of that.
[30:34.280 --> 30:40.680]  Yeah. Don't give it too big. It's hard to get big dabs of the CBD oil because it's super viscous.
[30:40.680 --> 30:43.880]  This, this dabber has got a flat tip on it and it may work a little bit better for you.
[30:44.840 --> 30:49.880]  Yeah. It was so cold. It felt like it was burning for a second. Isn't that weird how your body can
[30:49.880 --> 30:54.200]  do that? Yeah. You guys, winter is here in Colorado. I don't know about winter, but fall
[30:54.200 --> 30:58.280]  is certainly here in Colorado. Yep. You need a long sleeve shirt when you drive to work in the
[30:58.280 --> 31:02.840]  morning. Season done changed. You know, and speaking medically, I know we're talking about
[31:02.840 --> 31:08.760]  pain. Yeah. I'd love to hear what you have to say, Doug, but, uh, I'm disabled with post-traumatic
[31:08.840 --> 31:15.400]  stress disorder. Okay. And, uh, I know there's been a lot of studies looked at. I think that
[31:15.400 --> 31:21.720]  it's probably the best medicine for it. Uh, I've tried and had been prescribed many other things,
[31:21.720 --> 31:27.400]  but I believe that cannabis is probably the best thing that I've ever had that helps me control,
[31:28.040 --> 31:33.640]  uh, what goes on with that. You know, uh, I don't want to, yeah, I probably got a similar
[31:33.640 --> 31:36.440]  thing. I don't want to compare myself, but I probably got something and I'll agree with you.
[31:36.440 --> 31:39.880]  And if I start thinking about shit that I don't even want to think about, I can make those things
[31:39.880 --> 31:43.960]  not happen in my mind. It's just by coming and just taking a couple of dabs and it may be part
[31:43.960 --> 31:47.640]  of the ritual. Like you were saying earlier, I've just done, I'm going to grab a dab, get into the
[31:47.640 --> 31:51.720]  internet, play around for a minute. My brain will change. Yeah. Like, yeah. It's also, you know,
[31:51.720 --> 31:57.000]  for me, it's real hard for, uh, used to love to go over anywhere. There was lots of people.
[31:57.000 --> 32:02.920]  It's not that way anymore. I really have to get prepared to go to the grocery store. Not because
[32:02.920 --> 32:08.840]  I don't know what I'm going to get, because I get the same thing every time, but just to deal with,
[32:08.840 --> 32:15.640]  with people in close quarters, it just makes me uncomfortable. I would rather not deal with,
[32:15.640 --> 32:20.920]  I'd come up in the parking lot. It's completely full or you look over in the baskets are almost
[32:20.920 --> 32:30.040]  all gone. I just go back home, you know, which even if I really need the food, I'll just go back
[32:30.040 --> 32:35.400]  all chill for a little bit and wait for the crowds to die down. Bread and cheese. Yeah. Not
[32:35.400 --> 32:41.000]  that bad. But you know, sometimes you can't do that. I, you know, you got other people depending
[32:41.000 --> 32:48.760]  on you. Uh, then you suck it up and you do it. And sometimes based with those types of situations,
[32:48.760 --> 32:53.480]  cannabis definitely helps me deal with them. Okay. It helps. It's a little bit of anxiety,
[32:53.800 --> 33:00.040]  PTSD, a little bit of social anxiety. Okay. All right. So if anybody's listening that doesn't
[33:00.040 --> 33:04.600]  think that this shit is good for PTSD, because in Colorado we cannot get it validated as a,
[33:05.240 --> 33:10.280]  a qualifying condition for medical treatment or for medical use. If you guys think that that's not
[33:11.320 --> 33:15.480]  a reason to use it, listen to this dude, this is an honest guy. This dude has never lied to me.
[33:15.480 --> 33:19.000]  I believe every single word that Doug has ever said. Yeah. He's got no reason to lie to me. He's
[33:19.000 --> 33:24.360]  a 60 year old dude. He's done his thing. Yeah. You're lying. Yeah. You don't need to lie.
[33:24.360 --> 33:29.080]  And days are done. There's nobody to impress anymore. God damn it. I'm gonna take some dabs
[33:29.080 --> 33:35.400]  with these kids and be on the podcast. And it works. Oh yeah, dude. I love that. Well,
[33:35.400 --> 33:40.760]  I enjoy being with you and I'm going to enjoy this. Yeah. Salute. There we go. All right. So
[33:40.760 --> 33:45.720]  my good friend Doug has taken a really quite wonderful. Well, a shout out to the person that
[33:45.720 --> 33:49.240]  gave it to me. I don't know if they want to be mentioned on the show or not. They do nice work.
[33:49.240 --> 33:55.400]  The pain is melting as we speak. Yes. Yeah. That cherry flavor. Yep. Yeah. I don't smoke a lot of
[33:55.400 --> 33:59.240]  the CBD. I saved all that for you guys. That's why I'm kind of over here. Just kind of tucked away
[33:59.240 --> 34:05.560]  until you guys showed up. That's delicious. Cherries. It is. It's like a mouthful of
[34:05.560 --> 34:10.360]  cherries out of the hit man rig with the elevate dropdown on the email. Cause we're champs over
[34:10.360 --> 34:14.760]  here. Oh, that was marvelous. Right on for helping him out. Mike. Mike with the, uh,
[34:15.720 --> 34:19.960]  which the alley you climbed up there. Oh yeah. This carb cap needs to be cleaned a little bit.
[34:19.960 --> 34:24.520]  They get quite filthy around here. If anybody needs to add, there's a little wax in here,
[34:24.520 --> 34:28.680]  but I think you guys would be cool for a minute. All right. So Doug was talking about, uh,
[34:28.680 --> 34:32.120]  oh, you were talking about how bad it helps with the PTSD. Yeah. You know, and we,
[34:32.120 --> 34:34.880]  you know, the military was looking into it. Um,
[34:34.960 --> 34:39.840]  they found out that they didn't want to do it right now, but I, uh, I think that if you were
[34:39.840 --> 34:45.760]  to talk some people that were suffering from it, um, I think we see a lot of them around town now.
[34:46.480 --> 34:51.360]  Yeah, absolutely. Because this is where the help is. Yeah. Yeah. Oh man. So many people are coming
[34:51.360 --> 34:54.880]  here and you guys, unfortunately what I've discovered through some conversations lately,
[34:54.880 --> 35:00.320]  there are a lot of children moving here for CBD treatment and those people are falling into traps
[35:00.880 --> 35:06.000]  with people that advertise that they can give them CBD medicine and they're not providing the CBD
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.720]  medicine. Unfortunately, if you're looking for qualified, legitimate CBD medicine in Colorado,
[35:10.720 --> 35:15.280]  somebody that can take on a new person and provide that it's going to be a three month wait,
[35:15.280 --> 35:20.240]  maybe six months. Yeah. The caregivers are strapped. And with the new,
[35:20.240 --> 35:26.800]  the new regulations taking effect in January, I doubt, um, many more people will be becoming
[35:27.280 --> 35:34.480]  caregivers. I expect a number of caregivers in business now to end up not being caregivers
[35:35.280 --> 35:40.000]  sometime by the middle of next year. Um, the state's really looking to clamp down
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.920]  and kind of stamp out that whole section of our industry, which sucks for people like me and
[35:43.920 --> 35:48.400]  Doug. Absolutely. That's, that's depressing. Right. And myself. Yep. There's a lot of new
[35:48.400 --> 35:53.120]  rules coming down the pipe that are going to make it incredibly difficult for people to produce the
[35:53.120 --> 35:57.440]  amount of meds they need for their patients. And yeah, and that's, and that's by design.
[35:57.440 --> 36:03.600]  Absolutely. They want everybody buying from the stores and we're going to see Walmart type stores
[36:03.600 --> 36:08.160]  in the future. Right? Yep. Well, like we talked about earlier, I'm already having to source other
[36:08.160 --> 36:11.680]  shatter to get you guys supplied in your shatter because everybody stepped up. I don't know if it
[36:11.680 --> 36:15.920]  was a good idea for me to step everybody up to shatter, but I got you guys all smoking good hash
[36:15.920 --> 36:19.360]  now. So now I can't even supply enough of it because you guys smoke so much of it. I'm not
[36:19.360 --> 36:22.880]  complaining, but between the three of us, we clean out the garden that I grow. Yeah.
[36:22.880 --> 36:28.480]  Well, and other people that I know are, everybody's looking towards concentrates,
[36:28.480 --> 36:33.360]  right? Because it's so much more convenient and it works better all the way around. It's
[36:33.360 --> 36:38.320]  just a better product. Right. For me, it's the time saver is what I've been enjoying lately.
[36:38.320 --> 36:43.760]  Yeah. Like my day is full. My hours are very, very well allocated. I don't have extra time to
[36:44.400 --> 36:49.760]  grind up some bud, pack a bowl, sit there and puff on it for a little while. I just don't have
[36:49.760 --> 36:55.040]  that kind of time anymore. Right. Yep. And a quick dab gets me where I need to be and I can get back
[36:55.040 --> 37:00.560]  to doing whatever I need to be doing. Take a fat dunk and keep on moving. Yeah. Take a dab,
[37:00.560 --> 37:05.600]  cough for a minute, chug a soda and get back to whatever I was doing. Oh, the other half of the
[37:05.600 --> 37:08.960]  yard. I'm going to make fun of Mike for a minute, but this is all in good fun. Cause he's one of my
[37:08.960 --> 37:12.800]  favorite people to hang out with. Mike's my bro and he knows it. If you're ever with Mike and you
[37:12.880 --> 37:17.120]  are thirsty, just tap him on the shoulder and say, just set him up. Cause he, Mike has a Mountain
[37:17.120 --> 37:22.640]  Dew with him. Mike probably has six to 12 Mountain Dews. I got sick of having cotton mouth and not
[37:22.640 --> 37:26.960]  having anything to drink. So I did some about it. Yeah. Some people carry like their cigarettes and
[37:26.960 --> 37:31.120]  like a safe spot. Mike's got Mountain Dews up his sleeve. He can fling them out of his arm.
[37:31.120 --> 37:39.040]  Like he's Spider-Man or some shit. Yep. I've always got at least one at reach. Yes, he does.
[37:39.120 --> 37:42.800]  All right. So I appreciate you guys kind of let me talk a little bit about your conditions and
[37:42.800 --> 37:45.280]  shit. Do you have any, I want to change the subject in just a second, but before I do,
[37:45.280 --> 37:48.560]  I want to give you guys the opportunity. Do you have anything to add to this part before I kind
[37:48.560 --> 37:52.000]  of move on to a totally random question that I want to ask you guys about? Just cause I'm curious.
[37:53.600 --> 37:58.160]  You guys both look at me in silence. I'm looking forward to more, a bigger selection of CBD
[37:58.160 --> 38:02.880]  edibles. That would be nice. That would be very nice. Wouldn't it be nice to just get up and eat
[38:02.880 --> 38:07.120]  like a muffin or a bagel or a cookie or whatever that just had your dose in it?
[38:07.600 --> 38:11.120]  Unfortunately, the way that the way that this industry is working, you guys aren't going to
[38:11.120 --> 38:14.720]  be able to eat muffins and cookies for much longer. They're going to regulate the shit out
[38:14.720 --> 38:20.160]  of it so much that a muffin will not be allowed. If they can airbrush that dumb ass yellow triangle
[38:20.160 --> 38:25.040]  on it, they're good. You can airbrush my poppy seed muffin people get on it. The regulations
[38:25.040 --> 38:29.520]  on edibles are becoming ridiculous. Really ridiculous. And it sucks. Some of my favorite
[38:29.520 --> 38:36.000]  products are going to be leaving store shelves and coming back in 10 milligram maximum containers,
[38:36.080 --> 38:42.560]  which sucks. I like the drinks. The kick in time is a lot quicker. Yeah. Oh yeah. You bet you do.
[38:42.560 --> 38:46.240]  Especially on an empty stomach. I forget how spoiled I am being a medical patient,
[38:46.240 --> 38:50.960]  being able to walk into a shop and get a drink with a hundred milligrams of THC and that sucker.
[38:50.960 --> 38:54.000]  But on the rec side, you guys have to put 10 milligrams in them and drink 10 of them.
[38:54.960 --> 38:58.960]  That's coming. You can get a hundred milligram drink right now, but they're taking that away.
[38:58.960 --> 39:02.400]  If you can't carry the stamp, it's gotta be in a 10 milligram package period.
[39:03.280 --> 39:09.120]  Um, so if you can't stamp your shit no more, I mean, you can't stamp liquids period. So liquids,
[39:09.120 --> 39:13.280]  popcorns, granolas, that kind of thing's got to come in a 10 milligram. So they're actually going
[39:13.280 --> 39:19.840]  to put a stamp on everything. That's the plan. So like a cookie, a stamp, yellow triangle,
[39:19.840 --> 39:28.560]  yellow triangle so that the teacher can see it from across the room. Well, or like I've got a
[39:28.560 --> 39:33.280]  triangle on my cookie. Why is it society? Everybody? Why shouldn't it be parenting?
[39:33.280 --> 39:37.600]  Shouldn't we focus on parenting instead of labeling? The fucked up analogy that I came up
[39:37.600 --> 39:45.920]  with is we, we put a special symbol on the fake guns, not the real ones, but we got, we got to
[39:45.920 --> 39:51.600]  put a special symbol on right now. All, all your toy guns got to come with a little orange nub on
[39:51.600 --> 39:56.640]  the fucking front of it. Right? But no real gun doesn't need nothing on it. That's like, just so
[39:56.640 --> 40:02.000]  you know, this is a gun gun and not like a lookalike gun or a squirt gun. I wish somebody
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.680]  could have seen me pressing my forehead against this microphone in retardation, but now all the
[40:07.680 --> 40:13.520]  pot cookies have to carry a special fucking warning symbol because people that have never
[40:13.520 --> 40:19.440]  been in a marijuana shop are convinced that they look just like chips away and that they're going
[40:19.440 --> 40:24.800]  to be at a party one day. And one of us is going to change out the real chips away for the medicated
[40:24.800 --> 40:29.600]  chips away. No way. And then they're going to kill everybody at their church because it's just
[40:29.600 --> 40:33.200]  nuts. I'm going to share the cookies with you guys, my friends, and I'm going to tell you,
[40:34.240 --> 40:39.680]  there's weed in these, eat them with me. They ended up so much fear last Halloween that
[40:39.680 --> 40:42.560]  we're definitely going to pass. I was going to head that way. That was part of what I was going
[40:42.560 --> 40:46.960]  to ask here. And then a minute, I had two questions for you in the Halloween scare was one of them.
[40:46.960 --> 40:50.160]  Cause we were putting up Halloween decorations at the spot. And I was like, do you guys really
[40:50.160 --> 40:54.560]  think that somebody is going to give out some weed candy this year? And Mike kind of beat me to it.
[40:54.560 --> 41:00.320]  So last year the, they're going to eat it themselves. Yeah. The two big anti-pot groups
[41:00.320 --> 41:06.800]  in the state, like took out billboards with edibles out of their packaging next to candy or
[41:06.800 --> 41:10.880]  edible treats that they look similar to. It was like, if you can't tell the difference,
[41:10.880 --> 41:16.720]  how were your kids? And a whole bunch of people in the state were convinced that the day after
[41:16.720 --> 41:22.960]  Halloween, like the ERS would just be full of kids that were just high as shit. It didn't happen. And
[41:22.960 --> 41:26.800]  it didn't happen for a lot of reasons, mostly because it's the dumbest crime ever. Right?
[41:26.800 --> 41:34.240]  Like there are so many better ways to get a felony. You can't hand out dirty candy on Halloween and
[41:34.240 --> 41:38.880]  have like, that leads right back to you. And there's no payoff for the criminal. Right. You
[41:38.880 --> 41:43.680]  got about three hours worth of the sick fuck that likes to hurt kids. Like doesn't like to
[41:43.680 --> 41:50.160]  hurt kids in theory. And it was expensive, right? Like 25 bucks a fucking piece. Like who's got
[41:50.160 --> 41:55.120]  that kind of money to get local kids stoned, right? I'm going to eat them all. Right. If you
[41:55.120 --> 42:00.400]  guys think that you have candy that your kids got on Halloween and you suspect that it is medicated
[42:00.400 --> 42:04.400]  with cannabis, you can send that shit to the show. You can send it right to me. My name is
[42:04.400 --> 42:07.840]  Rasta Jeff. I've got a PO box. You can send it. No, I shouldn't do that. We'll pick it up in
[42:07.840 --> 42:10.960]  person. We'll come pick it up in person. Let's fuck all this mail. I don't want to get myself
[42:10.960 --> 42:17.360]  in trouble. We'll come pick it up. Call me. I will eat all of it or half of it, whatever you choose.
[42:17.440 --> 42:20.880]  And in a little bit, I'll tell you if that shit has a medicated cannabis in it.
[42:21.520 --> 42:24.560]  We'll see. We'll see if that's, if it's medicated with, with THC.
[42:24.560 --> 42:30.080]  It's always, it's always the scare tactic about the children. You know, when I was a child and
[42:30.080 --> 42:36.000]  went trick or treating people gave out popcorn balls and fruit. And then one year there was a
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.760]  massive scare that someone was putting razor blades in those fruits and other things in your
[42:41.760 --> 42:46.960]  cookies. And all of a sudden you couldn't take grandma's treats anymore. They had to go buy them
[42:46.960 --> 42:51.760]  from the store and they had to be packaged and Mars company loved it.
[42:51.760 --> 42:56.800]  Oh yeah. Who do you think did it? Yeah, exactly. Do you think, and there was never,
[42:56.800 --> 43:02.240]  it was the best marketing campaign Mars could have ever come up with. That's almost too smart
[43:02.240 --> 43:06.960]  to spur a corporation. They paid one of their kids. Let me feed you this snicker or let me
[43:06.960 --> 43:10.960]  feed you this random X brand candy. It's almost never happened. We'll put you on the news and
[43:10.960 --> 43:15.680]  we'll make you rich. I'm the type of asshole who spent four hours on the internet looking for
[43:15.680 --> 43:22.640]  cases of there's no, it's happened like three times. Two of them were family members that were
[43:22.640 --> 43:29.680]  like, fuck my dumb nephew. And I mean, it's not funny, but it's really funny because when you
[43:29.680 --> 43:34.960]  think that the links we've gone to as a nation to like every nice old lady that's ever tried to
[43:34.960 --> 43:39.920]  make sugar cookies for all the kids that come by and then like three hours into Halloween,
[43:39.920 --> 43:44.160]  they realized that their fucking sidewalks covered with sugar cookies and all the parents think
[43:44.160 --> 43:50.080]  they're insane because they just happened to miss that part of their, our mass education against
[43:50.080 --> 43:54.560]  taking delicious treats from people on Halloween. I need a cookie from an old lady. She ain't got
[43:54.560 --> 44:01.360]  no reason to hate me. Right? I'm pretty scared of who I take candy from as an adult. I've been
[44:01.360 --> 44:04.720]  to grateful dead shows, man. You don't take candy from strangers. They got fucked up your whole
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.840]  weekend. Hey, and as a responsible parent, you look through that candy before you give your child
[44:09.840 --> 44:12.960]  just to make sure they're not just, you got to take out all the reasons.
[44:14.880 --> 44:19.840]  Exactly. Yeah. My parents love that rule. I never got back the number of snickers. I know I fucking
[44:19.840 --> 44:26.400]  collect it. That's the truth. For holidays. Those are no good for you, son. Those are the special
[44:26.400 --> 44:30.400]  pile over here. These might've been open or something wrong with them. Maybe. Yeah. These
[44:30.400 --> 44:33.760]  are mine. Uh, we used to go to the fancy neighborhoods and find out where they were
[44:33.760 --> 44:38.240]  giving out the best candy. And then I would take two or three masks in my car because we, yeah,
[44:38.320 --> 44:49.200]  yeah. I still took a trip to El Camino and university park. Hey, at least I wasn't stealing
[44:49.200 --> 44:53.200]  the bags. Some of my friends were out just taking bags of candy from other kids. I was actually
[44:53.200 --> 44:57.280]  trick or treating go Pueblo. I pled my case to some lady. She's like, you're too old. And I go,
[44:57.280 --> 45:00.000]  I could have just been out stealing candy from kids. And she's like, here, take two.
[45:01.360 --> 45:07.360]  Thank you. That's that's what I get. All right. So, um, let's shift gears. Happy Halloween. All
[45:07.360 --> 45:11.520]  you guys, this will be coming out a little bit before the Halloween show. No, it's hollow. Well,
[45:11.520 --> 45:15.920]  since number 100 is going to be celebration, the one after 101 will probably be the Halloween show,
[45:15.920 --> 45:20.400]  but whatever it's October. This is the fall celebration show. It's the harvest party. The
[45:20.400 --> 45:24.560]  boo preview harvest party. I like that. It's almost harvest time. We should get Jesse on here.
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.400]  He's talking about a lot of people harvesting chop, chop, chop. Or if they got to keep it,
[45:28.400 --> 45:34.320]  it was also right. And just if you got to keep it, all right, dude, Evan number 100 is next. Holy
[45:34.480 --> 45:37.920]  shit. That's so awesome. That's crazy. Great. You know what you're doing yet? Um, yeah,
[45:37.920 --> 45:40.880]  we're going to have a bunch of people on the podcast and we're going to talk about stuff.
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.680]  Cool. You know, those shows, when I set up like six microphones and it gets chaotic,
[45:45.680 --> 45:48.320]  that's what we're going to do. Those are fun. Yeah. We're going to take dabs and it's going
[45:48.320 --> 45:53.120]  to be loud and Spence will hit Maddie in the face with the microphone a lot. It'll be funny.
[45:53.120 --> 45:57.200]  Hopefully I can get Maddie and Spence over another episode. 50 dude. I fucking love it. Yeah. 50
[45:57.200 --> 46:02.400]  times too. It'll be twice as great. Cool. If you guys want to, uh, if you're listening to the
[46:02.400 --> 46:06.160]  podcast this far, I'd love you for listening to our random banter. Well done everybody.
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.080]  But if there's something you remember from the first hundred episodes that you'd like me to
[46:12.080 --> 46:15.680]  reminisce about, uh, send me your favorite moments of the show. Let me know what you're
[46:15.680 --> 46:18.800]  thinking about. What makes you laugh? Your favorite memories, something that sticks out
[46:18.800 --> 46:22.960]  to you on the show. Let me know what you think of like, remember that one time you said this,
[46:22.960 --> 46:26.320]  uh, you can send a couple of them. You don't, you're not limited to just one, but tweet it to
[46:26.320 --> 46:31.440]  me. Uh, it's at GFYH podcast, email it to me. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com or find it on
[46:31.440 --> 46:36.160]  Facebook. It's the growth from your heart podcast on Facebook message me, let me know. And we'll
[46:36.160 --> 46:40.080]  kind of reminisce about it and go talk back about it on the show. If you let me know what episode
[46:40.080 --> 46:43.440]  be like on episode this, you said this or just whatever, you know, let me know what you remember.
[46:43.440 --> 46:47.040]  And we'll laugh about it again and be like, I did say that because sometimes I say some goofy shit.
[46:47.040 --> 46:50.560]  Sometimes I say some great shit. Remind me what stood out to you. I'd like to hear it.
[46:51.120 --> 46:54.240]  Yeah. Same goes for me. If you like something I said on the show, you guys have been getting a
[46:54.240 --> 46:59.520]  lot of me lately. You like it. Tweet me. You guys follow Mike on Twitter. What's your Twitter handle?
[46:59.600 --> 47:02.800]  Nemo punk 15. Uh, yeah. At Twitter.
[47:04.800 --> 47:09.440]  That's at Nemo punk 15. Yeah. Yeah. Follow him. Cause he wants some more followers. And when
[47:09.440 --> 47:11.920]  you follow him, let him know that you found him on the grow from your heart podcast.
[47:11.920 --> 47:15.280]  Yeah. Let me know you're tweeting or you're following me from the podcast.
[47:15.280 --> 47:18.960]  Just hit hashtag grow from your heart. Cause it's hashtag GFYH podcast.
[47:18.960 --> 47:22.880]  So you saw me fucking with prohibitionists and thought it was funny and wanted more of it.
[47:22.880 --> 47:26.720]  Yeah. And if you find me, uh, you're too stoned. I'm not there.
[47:26.720 --> 47:31.200]  Yeah. Doug doesn't really do much social media. We'll keep him on the down low.
[47:31.200 --> 47:35.360]  Uh, so lately you guys, the hot topic has been, uh, and we're just going to go on this one for
[47:35.360 --> 47:38.240]  a couple of seconds. Cause I wrote it down and I just want to be able to cross it off
[47:38.240 --> 47:42.720]  because I'm a completionist. Uh, how do you guys feel about professional athletes being
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.600]  able to use marijuana first in their on season and also in their off season? Cause that's two
[47:47.600 --> 47:50.720]  different subjects. You're on the clock and not off the clock. I think when you're with a team,
[47:50.720 --> 47:54.160]  they kind of own you. So we have to make two separate, separate subjects that I say that
[47:54.160 --> 47:57.200]  wrong. Is that not good to say? You don't look like that. No, I don't mean it like that, bro.
[47:59.840 --> 48:04.880]  It really depends on your take on it. Just you always be careful with that particular verbiage.
[48:04.880 --> 48:13.360]  Yeah. But in this case, you're not totally in the wrong. I suppose. Um, they live under some
[48:13.360 --> 48:20.000]  pretty insane fucking regiment. Yeah. You're on their clock. Well, it's, it doesn't, they're worth
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.600]  millions and millions of dollars. Right. Yeah. Um, their house just keeps getting worse. Yeah.
[48:26.480 --> 48:30.640]  So, all right. So you're on the clock basically during the on season, the whole season from the
[48:30.640 --> 48:34.480]  time season starts from whatever preseason training time, spring, whatever spring training,
[48:34.480 --> 48:38.400]  when it starts, you're on the clock until that super bowl or whenever your team is fucking
[48:38.400 --> 48:44.400]  finished, whatever you fail or when you're on the clock. So should you be able to use cannabis to
[48:44.400 --> 48:50.400]  alleviate your pains? Uh, or for whatever reason, fuck it. It's a, it's a recreational state.
[48:50.400 --> 48:57.760]  The neuro protectant research coming out. That's really promising. Like it might really help, uh,
[48:57.760 --> 49:03.280]  deal with concussions, brain injuries, that kind of thing. So it might be really, yeah,
[49:03.280 --> 49:08.800]  it might be insanely fucking helpful for people to get bashed in the face for a living rugby players,
[49:08.800 --> 49:14.080]  people on boxers, soccer players, just taking place right now. So you feel that, uh, on their
[49:14.320 --> 49:17.680]  off season is what I'm asking about now. You feel that those guys should be allowed to consume
[49:17.680 --> 49:22.480]  cannabis medical or recreational. Oh, for sure. Yeah. On there during the off season,
[49:22.480 --> 49:26.320]  as much as they'd run as much as they'd like, right. They can, they can drink alcohol.
[49:26.320 --> 49:30.560]  All it takes and call it okay. In any state, they're adults in all 50 States.
[49:31.200 --> 49:34.400]  If I was king of the world, it would have been legal for everybody a long time ago. Okay. I
[49:34.400 --> 49:40.160]  agree with that. Yeah. Rastafari, no Babylon. Let's let everybody. So, okay. So then I'm sure
[49:40.160 --> 49:44.560]  you're going to say that yes to this one also, do you think that these guys, um, and I'll ask
[49:44.560 --> 49:48.000]  about specific sports after I generalize, we'll just, we'll kind of narrow it down. Do you think
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.720]  that professional athletes should be able to consume cannabis on during the on season? Like
[49:52.720 --> 49:57.760]  the night after a game, maybe the day before a game, maybe what if you're a better, what if,
[49:57.760 --> 50:01.520]  what if you're a better player when you smoke a fat joint, should they be able to play? Should
[50:01.520 --> 50:05.680]  they be able to smoke right before the game? Okay. That would be a performance enhancing drug,
[50:06.400 --> 50:10.400]  but how many other performance enhancing drugs are those other football players using?
[50:10.400 --> 50:14.560]  Well, see, and that cannabis is so not a performance. Yeah, it isn't. I just said
[50:14.560 --> 50:19.280]  that jokingly. What kind of is, um, we'll know they're, they're legitimately testing people as
[50:19.280 --> 50:25.120]  though it's steroids, right? And that when they're looking for steroids, they, they also look for pot
[50:25.120 --> 50:31.120]  as though they're the same and that's nuts. Like at best, it's helping you focus or keeping you
[50:31.120 --> 50:35.680]  from being in pain while you, you know what I mean? It's not making you stronger or faster.
[50:35.680 --> 50:40.480]  Not building your muscles up. It's not increasing your adrenaline. It's,
[50:40.480 --> 50:46.000]  but I have absolutely no issues with people using blamed. Right. Yeah. Okay. I have absolutely no
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.640]  issues with people consuming cannabis when they're not at work. Okay. Like there are a lot
[50:50.640 --> 50:54.080]  of people who do shit. That's kind of, well, that's why I'm thinking about sports. Like football
[50:54.080 --> 50:58.800]  players crashing to other people at high speeds. Yeah. And there's a lot of power there. Like that
[50:58.800 --> 51:03.440]  needs to be precisely controlled or somebody is going to die. And like, I'm down for us to go
[51:03.440 --> 51:07.360]  watch people kill each other, but we need to give them like swords and just call it gladiatorial
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.840]  we're going to go that route. Like getting football players intoxicated and letting them
[51:11.840 --> 51:15.520]  rush each other is not how we get there. That's going to be one of the things people tweet about
[51:15.520 --> 51:21.200]  on episode 100. Probably bring back gladiators. We like Mike's point. And me saying that people
[51:21.200 --> 51:26.000]  own people. It'll be the thing that I hear about. I bet. I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. I
[51:26.000 --> 51:32.080]  made a faux pas and I apologize. Now I realize what I said. It's not what I meant at all.
[51:32.080 --> 51:38.640]  Now sometimes we step in the trap. Words are hard these days. Yes. I'm politically erect. Well,
[51:38.640 --> 51:44.240]  everything means 11 things. Yes, exactly. All right. So we all think that sports athletes,
[51:44.240 --> 51:47.280]  the professional athletes should be able to consume cannabis. They're allowed to drink alcohol
[51:47.280 --> 51:52.080]  if they so choose. And in Colorado, we have pretty much put the same rules on booze or on the same
[51:52.080 --> 51:58.240]  rules on cannabis. That's exactly what they mirrored. Yeah, they can. Most of us can go out
[51:58.240 --> 52:02.560]  after a hard day of whatever we do. And we know how many how many other people slam into other
[52:02.560 --> 52:07.280]  people all day for a damn living. Like, why can't these people go smoke a little bit of reefer if
[52:07.280 --> 52:12.640]  their buddies can smoke, can drink some beers? I can't I can't drink beer. Beer is no good for me.
[52:12.640 --> 52:16.880]  Beer does nothing good for me. But smoking cannabis, I have plenty of medicinal value
[52:16.880 --> 52:21.040]  and plenty of benefits. So I don't go drink beer after work like several people do. And I'm not
[52:21.040 --> 52:24.240]  judging. I'm just saying that doesn't work for me. Yeah, I come home and smoke some weed, smoke
[52:24.240 --> 52:29.040]  some dabs and it works wonderfully. We should have an alternative. I agree. Yeah, completely.
[52:29.920 --> 52:35.840]  Excellent. So it shouldn't have to be confined. Two places where.
[52:38.640 --> 52:42.640]  You can't be seen. Absolutely. Where you where you have to hide.
[52:42.640 --> 52:49.040]  Adults like to gather and enjoy intoxicants with other adults. It's always been. I mean,
[52:49.040 --> 52:54.160]  it's literally this way. It's always been. You're taxing us for us for it. Give us some more to
[52:54.160 --> 52:59.280]  consume it. The first humans around the first fire got there like they gathered to get fucked up
[52:59.280 --> 53:04.960]  around it. Like that's just how humans work throughout history. There's always been a tavern
[53:04.960 --> 53:11.120]  or I mean, in different parts of the country, it's the street corner or in many cultures.
[53:11.760 --> 53:16.960]  This is where people get together and enjoy intoxicants. And yeah, having a place where
[53:16.960 --> 53:22.880]  people can go and consume pot together. Those are necessary. We need to get on it. Yeah. Yes,
[53:22.880 --> 53:27.200]  we sure do. That would be great. The whole country needs places. One or two or three or four in every
[53:27.200 --> 53:32.480]  state where we can all just meet and have little puff sessions. Yep. Yep. E-mails, dab rigs.
[53:32.480 --> 53:36.320]  Be awesome and not be harassed. Not be harassed by the police. That's all we want. You guys just
[53:36.320 --> 53:41.440]  to be able to smoke cannabis peacefully and hang out and socialize. There won't be as many problems
[53:41.440 --> 53:48.320]  as you have with alcohol consumption facilities. Stone people don't want to fight. No, no, no,
[53:48.960 --> 53:53.680]  no. We can all get pretty heated in this room. We have some arguing beliefs between us. I'm sure
[53:53.680 --> 53:58.720]  we can find something. We just want a big flaw in this room is going to swing at anybody. But
[53:58.720 --> 54:02.480]  there was beer in dazed and confused, right? They were drinking at the time too. He wanted to fight
[54:02.480 --> 54:06.240]  because he was at a beer. I've watched that movie with a number of people for the first time.
[54:06.240 --> 54:10.160]  And typically that's the one comment that gets made through the whole film is like,
[54:10.160 --> 54:13.280]  why is he aggressive? He was just smoking weed. Was his weed bad?
[54:14.560 --> 54:18.320]  Now that dude was drinking. He came there to drink beer and kick ass or something like that.
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.960]  Right. They were all out of beer. All right. So we're going to, we're going to start wrapping
[54:22.960 --> 54:25.680]  up the show, man. I really appreciate you guys for coming. Doug, you got anything else you want
[54:25.680 --> 54:33.760]  to add to us? Um, yeah, keep medicated, keep healthy. There you go. Fuck. I should, I just,
[54:33.760 --> 54:41.440]  we should just hit stop and drop the mic. Yeah, dude. Damn. That was perfect points. Um, I feel
[54:41.440 --> 54:46.000]  like we didn't give enough credit to edibles. There's a lot of really wonderful edible products
[54:46.000 --> 54:51.760]  on the market right now that you should definitely check out if you can. What would you recommend to
[54:51.760 --> 54:57.600]  somebody? People that choose just fucking went recreational and I'm excited about that. I'm so
[54:57.600 --> 55:01.040]  sick of telling people, no, they're not recreational yet. They're recreational now.
[55:01.600 --> 55:05.360]  Um, you can look for them on store shelves at your rec shops in Colorado. So if you guys are
[55:05.360 --> 55:09.600]  out of state, if you're in, if you're anywhere in the world and you're 21 and up, you can come
[55:09.600 --> 55:15.840]  to Colorado, um, fly to either Colorado Springs or Denver, Denver, Denver and drive. Fuck the
[55:15.840 --> 55:19.280]  Colorado Springs airport. Denver airport. It's going to take you two and a half to three hours
[55:19.280 --> 55:25.040]  to get to our, our dispensary. Come on down. Uh, tell everybody that you heard about the spot
[55:25.040 --> 55:30.800]  dispensary on the grow from your heart podcast, grab yourself some Chiva chews and grab yourself
[55:31.040 --> 55:35.680]  some quality flour. Uh, and then what else should they grab while they're at the shop?
[55:35.680 --> 55:40.080]  If they're coming, whatever they want, that's the beauty of legalization is you have a huge
[55:40.080 --> 55:44.240]  selection. Something will catch your eye in there. Oh my gosh. There's so much stuff in there,
[55:44.240 --> 55:48.400]  but come check out a Chiba. You guys come get, if you want to get like kind of high and be like
[55:48.400 --> 55:53.360]  trippy dippy, get like a sativa, a Chiba chew. They're one of the first edible companies to
[55:53.360 --> 56:00.080]  really nail the sativa Indica hybrid. Yes. And they've got a CBD chew now that I'm just waiting
[56:00.080 --> 56:05.440]  to test. I've just been trying that because I saw them get delivered just a few days ago.
[56:05.440 --> 56:09.200]  The Chiba chew guy was there. Yes. So if you want to get kind of trippy, get the sativa.
[56:09.200 --> 56:13.760]  If you want to mellow out and giggle, get the Indica, the Indica are intense. That's what I eat.
[56:13.760 --> 56:17.200]  If you want to kind of a balanced high, get those hybrids, go to the movies,
[56:17.200 --> 56:20.960]  take a hybrid and go to the movies. Uh, if you're just looking for straight pain relief and you
[56:20.960 --> 56:24.320]  don't want to feel high, if you don't want anybody to know that you're consuming cannabis for pain
[56:24.320 --> 56:28.560]  relief, get the CBD CBD. Yeah. They don't make your head. They don't make you head high. They
[56:28.560 --> 56:32.160]  don't make you giggly. They just make you feel better. So you've got an option. So come to
[56:32.160 --> 56:36.240]  Colorado, come get some Chiba chews, check it out, see what they do for you. Maybe don't take them
[56:36.240 --> 56:44.000]  home. Keep them here. I heard a little cocoa there. Some Joey Diaz. Yeah. Oh, some Chiba
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.160]  chews dog. When you said she would choose the second time you couldn't help it. Oh,
[56:48.160 --> 56:52.160]  subconsciously Joey Coco Diaz is one of my heroes. And I guess subconsciously Joey Diaz
[56:52.160 --> 56:56.880]  just slipped out of me. All right, dog. So go get some Chiba chews dog. All right, dog. I got
[56:56.880 --> 57:01.120]  these stars of death dog. Yeah. Joey's my hero. Shout out to Joey Diaz. Come back to Colorado,
[57:01.120 --> 57:04.640]  man. If you're listening to this, Joey Diaz, come back to Colorado, please. I'd love to come see you
[57:04.640 --> 57:10.480]  again. I miss you, bro. Yeah. Joey Diaz. Check him out. Joey Coco Diaz hilarious as a motherfucker.
[57:10.480 --> 57:14.000]  All right. I don't think we have a lot else to say. We didn't give edibles enough credit. Edibles
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.160]  are awesome. They're very medicinal. Uh, they take a little bit longer to work, but when they do,
[57:18.160 --> 57:22.640]  boy, they really, really, you have to plan a little better with edibles. Yeah. It's smoking
[57:22.720 --> 57:28.000]  so much simpler because you can titrate your dose really, really well. You know how hard what you,
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.280]  what you just took is going to hit you immediately. If you want a little more,
[57:31.280 --> 57:35.520]  you can take a little more. If you're good, you're good. You know that with edibles,
[57:35.520 --> 57:40.000]  it takes an hour and a half to kick in and you can't eat drugs. Yeah. Which is a bonus. If you
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.560]  can't sleep, eat yourself some edibles and then get stoned and then try to go to bed. And then
[57:44.560 --> 57:48.240]  hopefully you're sleeping and those edibles will kick in while you're sleeping and keep you asleep
[57:48.240 --> 57:53.120]  through the night. That's what I've been doing with edibles all summer long. I'll get a hundred
[57:53.120 --> 58:00.960]  milligram package and eat like 10 milligrams at eight, 10 milligrams at nine, 20 at 10 and 20 at
[58:00.960 --> 58:06.000]  11. And then when I go to bed, they're kicking in for the first few hours of my sleep. Sweet. Yeah.
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.560]  Get that metabolism moving. There you go. And then have a full night's rest. Yeah. Wake up
[58:10.560 --> 58:16.000]  eight hours later feeling great. So let's quickly, we've talked about, uh, dabs and smoking dabs and
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.600]  flowers. Uh, we've talked about edibles. We talked about tinctures. Um, we talked about your vape pen.
[58:21.600 --> 58:26.160]  We've kind of left out like rubs and creams is all I think that's left. And I've got one other
[58:26.160 --> 58:30.160]  product that we can talk about if we have a couple seconds, but you've looked like you got something
[58:30.160 --> 58:35.840]  to say that. No, when you said rubs and creams, I've talked to some people in my age bracket that
[58:35.840 --> 58:41.600]  are using some of the creams for arthritis and, uh, and swear by, I think it's, it's, it's the
[58:41.600 --> 58:46.720]  best thing since sliced bread. I did not take them seriously. And then a friend of mine gave
[58:46.720 --> 58:51.440]  me a bottle as a sample and I gave somebody a massage, uh, just from the shoulders to the
[58:51.440 --> 58:58.160]  mid back is all she let me do. But by then my fingers felt fluffy. Like I felt like I was
[58:58.160 --> 59:02.640]  wearing balloon gloves. So now I take it seriously. And she was like, wow, that was like a huge
[59:02.640 --> 59:06.560]  massage. And I was like, it's that apothecary. It was apothecary pain cream is what I used.
[59:06.640 --> 59:11.520]  And it, I definitely give the pains and saps credit. Now I did not before, but after that,
[59:11.520 --> 59:16.320]  I believe I'm a believer. Yeah. Yeah. I had one of the, it was one of the first generation
[59:16.320 --> 59:21.040]  topical lotions in Colorado. Just, just random lotion in a bottle with like a company sticker on
[59:21.040 --> 59:25.920]  it. I don't remember what the brand was, but I use it for after trimming to help absorb the rest of
[59:25.920 --> 59:30.240]  the trichomes off my skin that I couldn't get washed off. And it worked wonderful for that,
[59:30.240 --> 59:35.360]  but it would also help ease the pain from trimming. I mean, cause you spend seven, eight hours
[59:35.360 --> 59:40.720]  scissoring like a madman, your fingers cramp up one hands, holding a little stem all night,
[59:40.720 --> 59:44.880]  all day. And the other one's working a pair of scissors for that whole shift. It hurts. Yeah.
[59:44.880 --> 59:49.280]  And that pain cream, I mean, an hour after I used it, I felt like I hadn't been at work all day.
[59:49.280 --> 59:53.360]  It was great. Shout out to the ladies that trimmed my weed for me the other night.
[59:53.360 --> 59:58.800]  Well done. Yeah. Good job. Good job. So we've covered, uh, it seems like we've covered 90%
[59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.880]  of the consumption methods. Have either of you guys tried Mike's had some teas,
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:08.080]  did those work? Did it have any medicinal value? Uh, the teas that I was really into,
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:14.480]  um, most of that, I mean, the dose was so low and the quality was so sketchy back then that
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:19.840]  it was probably just a good flavor tea that I liked paying $5 a bag for. Okay. Um, but the,
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:24.080]  there's a couple of teas on the market that people swear by. I haven't tried them yet.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:29.040]  Um, I'm still working my way down the edible case. Nice. How about a transdermal patch? Have
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.800]  you tried one of those yet? I have a friend who did, um, in an effort to treat fibromyalgia with
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:41.600]  a CBD patch and she said it worked, but not as well as smoking. Okay. And she really likes, uh,
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:47.520]  she, she's got a CBD oil cartridge for her vape pen that she really, really likes.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.360]  Um, so far from fibromyalgia myself used to be on, uh, Lyrica. Okay.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.080]  Yeah. About 9,000 side effects on the commercial. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.600]  You know, when they're all smiling and talking about anal drainage and stuff. Yeah.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:10.160]  But, uh, then again, this is one of the drugs that I got rid of. Excellent. Once it started
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.520]  using the concentrates on a regular basis from medicine that myself and the garden of
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:19.680]  Whedon produce. There we go. Damn. That feels good. Yes, sir. Well, thank you, sir. That makes
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.240]  me proud. Thank you, sir. Lyrica has gone out of your diet because of things that Spence and I do.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:31.200]  I hope you hear that Spencer. I hope you hear that bro. Lyrica methadone. So Holy shit. All
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:36.560]  out of the out. No more. You know, uh, this may be too much, but a while back when I'd go visit
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.240]  you sometimes you'd be fucking out of it, dude. Yeah. I'm sure I was out of it. And lately you've
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.720]  been sharp. You've been Douglas again, which is cool. Yeah. And it is cool to be yourself again.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:51.040]  And not under a haze of medication. Yeah. Yeah. You can find the remote now you can find your
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.520]  phone now and you don't want the remote as much now because you want to go out and do something
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.480]  because you've got energy again. There you go. You know, you've got mobility again.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.520]  I wish you guys could see the look on Doug's face. He's sincere as fuck, dude. He's not
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:11.440]  bullshit at all. Oh no. And a motherfucker just dials back every other part of your life.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.960]  I've got a tiny, tiny boo-boo on my finger and it's been fucking up my whole week. It's just a
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.480]  tiny boo-boo. I could imagine. I mean, I've got some pain, but I can imagine having like hip pain
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.560]  at your age, like, God damn, I'm going to feel like I'm falling apart. And it's, it's not just
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:28.320]  like when my knees really start throbbing, it's not just the knee is the muscles on either side
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.040]  of it, tense up trying to protect it. And then you walk a little funny, trying to protect it.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:41.200]  Everything below your nipples is sore because it's trying to keep your knee from being really sore.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.720]  Right. And then living like that for weeks and months on end, you just become exhausted.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:53.600]  And after years you start walking different, you start living different. It affects you greatly.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:59.360]  And when you can't think of anything else except pain, when it's like a high note right between
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:04.800]  your ears and that's all that you can do is hear that scream that your mind is giving,
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:12.320]  Hey, we're hurting. Yeah. You know, do something. Uh, sometimes it changes it up. Not enough. You
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:18.400]  can do at that point, right? Sometimes it's just, you gotta live with that curl up and, and, and,
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:23.680]  and bite the bullet until something you can do to give some relief. You know, sometimes
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:29.600]  heat, sometimes cold, sometimes pharmaceutical medicine. So many people go to alcohol for that.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:37.840]  That's, you know, what we've seen since the beginning of alcohol, right? Yeah. People have
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.480]  always, I remember my grandparents would, would talk about, they'd take their shot and go, that's
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:49.120]  our medicine for the night. Uh, at the end of their lives, however, they wish that they, at least
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.840]  that's what they told me was that they wish they had quit that earlier in their life. Yeah. And
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.680]  that's one of the reasons I stopped earlier in my life. I'm glad you did. Cause I like the way you
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.680]  are. I'm not sure we'd get along if you drink. No, no, you wouldn't like me. I'm nobody would
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.920]  like me if I drank. We're so much alike, Doug. We're so much like, that's why we're such good
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:10.880]  bros. I'm sure that I was a lot like you were when I drank. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we're a lot
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:16.640]  like each other that we don't. Yes, absolutely. Fist bump bro. Got it. Every day. So, uh, there's
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.080]  one more way of consumption that I can think of that we have not talked about that I have tried.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:27.280]  Mike's looking at me like, uh, the lube, bro, the lube. So I work at a, I work at a dispensary and,
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:32.800]  uh, I got some lube dude. It, uh, it's called Evos. I believe there's a couple of different
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:38.560]  companies that make it Arias the main one. And then we carry Evo. Okay. Then it's Evos. Cause
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:44.880]  I got it from the spot dispensary. Um, sample day. I didn't get high at all from it, but yeah,
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.960]  Doug's looking at me like that kind of lube. Yeah, dude. That kind of lube. That's the nice
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.320]  thing about topicals is there's not an intoxication with them. Right. It's just a medical effect. So
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:00.160]  the instruction said like spray three to four sprays on her. So I went with like eight because,
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:06.320]  you know, double up. Yeah. And it wasn't spraying that much. So I was like spraying it on there.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:12.800]  And then it totally had sex with this chick and it felt warm and tingly and like, uh, hot. It was
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:18.640]  like hotter than normal. Like the temperature was higher and, um, it took a little more effort to
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.840]  finish up to tell you the truth. Like I had to like wrap it up. I was like, okay, let me,
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.920]  let me try a little harder. I think you did a big review of this on a previous show. Yeah,
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.920]  we kind of did, but we also did a review of what happens when I smoke too much CBD and I can't
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:35.520]  finish up at all. We talked about that as well. What's the base substance of the spray? Coconut
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.160]  oil. Yeah. Coconut oil. And then they infuse it with THC. They just, I pretty much think they put
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:44.000]  coconut oil in a Crock-Pot and throw a bunch of bud in there and then strain out the bud.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.400]  What I really think they do. Would not be surprised to find that that's the recipe.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.840]  But I did. I sprayed some in my hand and tasted it. I was like, this is just coconut oil with
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.480]  weed in it. The ingredients are coconut oil and cannabis. Two products Jeff is highly familiar
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.080]  with. Yeah, I know. Yeah. I'm a hippie. Oh, look. I know all about the coconut oil.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:04.640]  Looks live on coconut oil. It's good for everything, dude. If your hands are all sticky
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.680]  and you can't get the resin off your hands from trimming a little bit of coconut oil,
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.760]  I'll take that shit right off real quick. Yep. A million and one uses. And that's the first one
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:15.600]  I'll tell you about some of the other ones you don't even want to know. Nope. All right. So we're
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.040]  going to start wrapping up this show. I tried to do it earlier, but we've got so much shit to say.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.720]  I think we've covered all ways that I am familiar with consuming cannabis.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:29.040]  We did touch on, on children about people coming here and we kind of talked about that a little
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.960]  bit. Yeah. You know, I would just like to make a quick point because I, I know someone who has a
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:40.720]  special needs child, uh, seizures multiple times throughout the day. Uh, finally was able to get,
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:49.360]  uh, medication. Great. And has changed their life. Yeah. 180 degrees around. I mean, if you don't
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:54.640]  believe in this stuff, you need to come and see what it does. If you're worried about the children,
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:07:01.760]  worry about the ones that need this medication and can't get it because it's made this, not just
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:09.520]  this child's life, much happier, enjoyable, productive. But if you've ever been a caregiver
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:16.320]  of someone who suffers from something, you realize that that ripple expands out there far and when
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:22.800]  you give relief to the one that everyone cares so much about that ripple expands and gives relief
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:29.520]  to everyone that cares about them. Absolutely. Yep. No, if, uh, if you're a family moving here
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:34.720]  with a kid looking for CBD oil, or if you're just moving here looking for CBD oil, take your time to
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:41.200]  hunt down legit product. Yes. Um, there are a lot of places we, or Jeff talked about a news article
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:48.000]  recently that there's, um, hemp extract oil being sent from China. Um, if you can buy it online and
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.800]  have it shipped to you, it's not the real thing. Um, if you can get it outside of a dispensary,
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:59.600]  you have to be standing in, in Colorado. There's a 50, 50 chance. It's not the real thing. That's
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.800]  the truth. Um, if you're lucky and you live in another state that has a really solid medical
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:12.320]  marijuana program and lab testing for cannabinoids is required, you should be able to get the lab
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:16.800]  test right there with your product. You can check and see what you're buying right there in the
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:22.080]  store. If you can't be a little sketched out that you're buying stuff from a store that doesn't come
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:27.840]  with that, that should be a standard now with legalization in Colorado. If they don't have a
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:34.160]  lab test, they're full of shit. Um, it's, it's just that simple. Yeah, he's right. He's telling
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.960]  the truth. Um, if it's legal product in Colorado, you have to have it lab tested. If the store clerk
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.400]  tells you they don't have the lab test, they're lying. Yeah. They just don't want you to see
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:48.480]  something or they don't want to, they don't want you to see the 13% THC or whatever. Right. Um,
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.280]  or they're being lazy and don't want to grab it. But yeah, it's, it's standard information. Now we,
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:09:01.760]  you should be able to find CBD meds in a range of ratios with THC, um, anywhere from like a
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:10.000]  hundred to one CBD to THC to a one to one and two to one THC to CBD. Um, there should be a good
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.480]  selection available to you. You just have to take the time to find it from a legitimate dealer.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:19.440]  I hate seeing people come in here looking for what we've got and finding stuff that's fake.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.560]  Legitimate dealer. You mean a dispensary? Yep. The word dealer in there made that a funny ass
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.480]  sentence in my mind. I looked at Doug like, did you catch that at all? He said legitimate dealer.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:33.440]  Yep. We don't have dealers anymore. Retailer. Yeah. Legitimate retailer storefront.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:39.680]  Your legitimate MMC. Yep. Yeah. MIPS number. MIPS. All right. Yeah. Just look for all that
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:43.920]  shit. Make sure it's got a MIPS number and an MM and OPC number. It should have a lot of shit
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.280]  written on the container. Yeah. Way more than you're going to want to read, but read it all.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.320]  Read those labels once in a while. Check out, see what's going into the cannabis that you're
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.760]  buying from the dispensary. There's so much interesting shit on the labels. Yeah. Take
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.880]  your time. Grab some of the pamphlets from the front too sometimes when they got those
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.320]  like informative brochures that tell you about what certain cannabinoids do. Read that shit.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.320]  Inform yourself. Stay informed. Yeah. That's how people like, you know, so much about weed. I just
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.440]  read some shit. Right. I've got Google. I didn't go to a magic weed school. No, I kind of did.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.080]  Well, wait a minute. Yeah. It was called life. Yeah. All right. So this time I think we're
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:19.120]  serious. Anybody got any other methods of consumption? No, everybody went blank. Any
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:24.240]  shout outs or anything you want to give? All right. We're all good. Well, all right. Then
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.440]  make sure you guys follow Mike on Twitter. It's a at Nemo punk 15 support the legalization of
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.760]  cannabis and listen to Mike. He'll give you advice on how to do it on Twitter. Mike is getting pretty
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:40.640]  popular there on the weed Twitter. Oh, we bet. Yeah. You guys next week dude is episode 100.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.480]  That's awesome. We're going to party it up. I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen. I'm
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.560]  going to invite six or eight people. We're going to put about five microphones out on the table.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.360]  We're going to get down and have a good ass time. We're going to take dabs. We're going to play
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:55.920]  music. We're going to dance around. We're going to be joyous stoners. That's what we're going to do.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.440]  It's going to be a good ass time. I love it. I think that's the way to be. That's the way to be.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.640]  Yeah. So I hope you guys join us for episode number 100. I appreciate you for joining us
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.320]  for episode number 99. This was a good time. I hope you like this guys. You guys, thanks for
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.920]  coming out, dude. This was a great, great episode. This was fun. We need to get Doug on the show more
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.520]  often. You've got so many things in your head that we need to get out. It's just finding that
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:20.560]  trap door that leads to that story. Sometimes it's like, hell yeah. All right. If you guys are ever
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.920]  interested in sponsoring the podcast or if you have a product you'd like me to review on the show,
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:28.080]  send me an email. Mike and I would love to sit here and review some products. You send us some
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.040]  stuff. We will unbox it on the show. We will set it up. We will try it out. Whatever it is, we'll
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.440]  take a dab out of it. We'll ride it around. We'll fly on it. We'll film something with it. Whatever
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.120]  you want to send us, some sort of cannabis related product. If you want us to check it out,
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:45.600]  a grinder, a storage container, whatever you got. There's so many great products out there. We will
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:51.200]  review it. We'll shout it out. This show gets over 5,000 downloads every single episode and the
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.160]  episodes stay up forever. If I talk about your product, if I advertise your product on episode
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:00.880]  number 101, it will be there forever. It doesn't go away. It's on the internet all the time. People
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.800]  can listen to it. Every time I get a new listener, they go back and start at episode one. They'll
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.040]  hear your shit. Yeah, for the most part. Yeah, they do. There's a good percentage of listeners.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.200]  If they hear the show at episode 80, whatever, they discover me then. It's definitely worth going
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.760]  back through. There's a lot of good info. Sometimes it's embarrassing thinking that people are going
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.600]  back and hearing number one when I'm like, hi, welcome to my show. I'm all nervous.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.120]  It's great. I love it. If you guys want to find a good, if you're new to the podcast,
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.320]  make sure you listen to episode number 55. I think that'll really introduce you to who I am
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.400]  and what I'm about and what my company is about. 55 is a great one. I talk about iRegenetics,
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.880]  my seed company. I'm going to introduce myself pretty good at that point. We are rambling and
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:43.360]  high. We must've been smoking other jelly bean. It is good sativa. Dabs. Dabs, dabs, dabs, more
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.920]  dabs. All right, guys. Now that the show's over, I would appreciate it if you went to the iTunes

[01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:09.630]  Never fight the neighbor because of ego, discrimination, and folly.
[01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:15.550]  Time and vexation and distance becomes a reality.
[01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:27.710]  For the one who can disagree with you, in them a true friend is found.
