[01:46.040 --> 01:49.720]  That's right there is a discord channel where all of the iRegenetics crew hangs
[01:49.720 --> 01:54.440]  out. I pop in the chat sometimes, join the live chat, join the crew, we hang out, take
[01:54.440 --> 01:58.560]  some dabs, talk about life, talk about growing, talk about whatever may be going
[01:58.560 --> 02:02.200]  on. A couple of nights ago I had some friends help me make some decisions on
[02:02.200 --> 02:06.200]  some merchandise. So there's a lot of cool stuff happening on the discord
[02:06.200 --> 02:10.600]  channel. Sometimes I do exclusive drops. I let people know that things are coming
[02:10.600 --> 02:14.800]  up on the discord channel. So that is another avenue to find some exclusive
[02:14.800 --> 02:19.440]  drops, exclusive information. So make sure you do check out the discord. The link
[02:19.440 --> 02:22.600]  will be in the show notes and in the video description and I will try to
[02:22.680 --> 02:26.760]  remember to put the link right here on the screen when I am editing. So check us
[02:26.760 --> 02:33.320]  out on discord. I was at a greenhouse today and those plants are taking off. I
[02:33.320 --> 02:39.200]  am recording on August 27th and today the plants are going crazy. Most of the
[02:39.200 --> 02:42.800]  plants are kicking into the flowering phase. They're starting to make big fuzzy
[02:42.800 --> 02:47.480]  pistols look like they got dandelions on them. Beautiful plants. Most of them are
[02:47.480 --> 02:50.800]  kicking off. There were a couple of strains however that are lagging a little
[02:50.800 --> 02:54.440]  bit. They're just stretching like crazy right now. I'm sure they'll catch up but
[02:54.440 --> 02:58.880]  it is an exciting time for the greenhouse grow. It was fun to be out
[02:58.880 --> 03:03.040]  there getting my shoes dirty, getting a sunburn. Great time. Loving the greenhouse
[03:03.040 --> 03:08.620]  life. That was a lot of fun. Let's keep moving. Some people were asking me to do
[03:08.620 --> 03:12.360]  some episodes about things that I have already done. The outdoor season is
[03:12.360 --> 03:16.080]  happening. Every outdoor season I get asked for a couple of outdoor episodes
[03:16.080 --> 03:19.480]  and then toward the end of the season I get asked for a couple of very specific
[03:19.920 --> 03:24.520]  episodes. I've already done those episodes that I have in my mind. A couple
[03:24.520 --> 03:27.840]  of them I've only done in audio form. I haven't done them in the new video
[03:27.840 --> 03:32.960]  format but a lot of old episodes are available on the YouTube channel and in
[03:32.960 --> 03:37.480]  the server wherever you're listening or watching this podcast from. To however
[03:37.480 --> 03:40.760]  you do that, listen to, watch it. You know what I meant to say. However you're
[03:40.760 --> 03:45.680]  enjoying this podcast there are a lot of old episodes that may include some of
[03:45.680 --> 03:48.840]  the grow advice and grow lessons and answers to questions which you are
[03:48.840 --> 03:52.480]  looking for. Don't forget about the old episodes is what I'm trying to say. We're
[03:52.480 --> 03:58.360]  at 668 right now. That means there are 667 other episodes that may have some
[03:58.360 --> 04:02.920]  answers that you haven't heard yet. Even though I have done a lot of episodes
[04:02.920 --> 04:08.000]  that I haven't converted to video format yet or redone in the video format, I will
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.560]  get to those. I was trying not to repeat myself too much but it is time. I've got
[04:11.560 --> 04:15.240]  to kind of reloop around and do some of those old episodes over again. I've
[04:15.240 --> 04:20.640]  learned a lot. Technology has changed. The growing has evolved. So it may be
[04:20.640 --> 04:23.960]  time to update some of those older episodes but don't forget to check the
[04:23.960 --> 04:28.440]  feed. Do a quick Google search. You may find an episode about the question
[04:28.440 --> 04:32.760]  you've got in mind. So don't forget about that old stuff. Let's move forward. I do
[04:32.760 --> 04:36.440]  have a screenshot on my phone. Somebody sent me a question. I just took a quick
[04:36.440 --> 04:40.480]  screenshot. It was the most efficient way to do it. This question came from our
[04:40.480 --> 04:43.360]  friend. I don't know if they want their name said. We're gonna skip that. The
[04:43.360 --> 04:47.680]  question says, what's up Rastajef? I've got a quick question. In your opinion is
[04:47.680 --> 04:53.000]  the Hella Dank Seed Company a legit seed bank? Do they carry legit iRegenetics?
[04:53.000 --> 04:59.000]  The answer to that is yes. The Hella Dank Seed Company is a legitimate vendor for
[04:59.000 --> 05:02.920]  iRegenetics. That is a great seed vendor, a great seed bank, a great seed company.
[05:02.920 --> 05:06.520]  They get stuff out to you quite quickly. They've got a good selection, a good
[05:06.520 --> 05:11.360]  variety and good fair pricing. I do support them, endorse them, promote them.
[05:11.360 --> 05:16.880]  They are part of the team. Most of the time you can verify a vendor by checking
[05:16.880 --> 05:22.520]  my website. I usually have most of the vendors updated on the website. Sometimes
[05:22.520 --> 05:28.320]  I'm still auditioning a vendor so I may not add them right away. But once they do
[05:28.320 --> 05:31.520]  sell a few packs and make a couple of orders and they show me that
[05:31.520 --> 05:34.480]  they have good quality customer service and they don't embarrass me in any way
[05:34.480 --> 05:39.920]  or frustrate my customers, then I do add them to the website. There are probably
[05:40.160 --> 05:45.320]  one or two, maybe three that need to be added to the website right now. I just
[05:45.320 --> 05:49.240]  haven't sent them to the web guy to do it. As soon as I send him an email he'll
[05:49.240 --> 05:53.200]  probably get them up there. We've got to get the Canadian link up there and a
[05:53.200 --> 05:57.000]  couple of others really soon. I've just got to make that happen. There is an
[05:57.000 --> 06:01.960]  official Canadian distributor. There are probably seven official vendors on the
[06:01.960 --> 06:06.520]  website now. What I'm getting at is if you ever want to know if a vendor is an
[06:06.520 --> 06:10.160]  official vendor of iRegenetics, all you've got to do is hit my website and
[06:10.160 --> 06:14.160]  on the website there is a list of vendors. Most of them are listed there.
[06:14.160 --> 06:18.280]  The company you asked about is listed there and the top three. They're one of
[06:18.280 --> 06:22.160]  the top three or top five vendors of my seed. They are a legitimate seed
[06:22.160 --> 06:26.480]  vendor. They are official. Check the website and most of the brands, the
[06:26.480 --> 06:30.200]  vendors will be updated pretty quickly. I'll send the email to get them all on
[06:30.200 --> 06:34.400]  there because they do approve and we're gonna add them. The Canada link will have
[06:34.400 --> 06:38.400]  a lot of people excited. All right so Hella Dank Seed Company is official. Yes.
[06:38.400 --> 06:42.960]  Don't forget to check out seedsherenow.com. Check out the Golden Ticket
[06:42.960 --> 06:48.600]  Seed Company, Heritage Seed Bank, El Fuego Seeds, Chi-Town Seeds. I know I'm
[06:48.600 --> 06:51.840]  skipping one and I apologize. I can't think of it right now. I just did that
[06:51.840 --> 06:57.120]  off the top of my head. If I missed your seed brand I'm sorry. Big shout out.
[06:57.120 --> 07:00.320]  Where are we going from there? I have got some Patreon messages. That's what I said
[07:00.320 --> 07:04.000]  we were gonna do. I've got a couple of great messages here in front of me. Let's
[07:04.080 --> 07:07.440]  jump right into that part. That's what you guys showed up for the question
[07:07.440 --> 07:12.720]  portion. This one came from my friend Kyle. This one came from Patreon. It says
[07:12.720 --> 07:16.440]  hey Rasta Jeff. What's up Kyle? Good to meet you bro. Says I can't thank you
[07:16.440 --> 07:19.760]  enough for all of the knowledge. You are very welcome brother. Keep listening and
[07:19.760 --> 07:23.560]  keep supporting on Patreon. I'll keep it coming. It says I heard about you from
[07:23.560 --> 07:28.560]  the DGC and I've really enjoyed your podcast. Big shout out to the DGC. Make
[07:28.560 --> 07:33.760]  sure you make sure you support the Dude Grows Show. Big shout out to the dude. Big
[07:33.800 --> 07:38.080]  shout out to Scotty Real. Big up to Guru and then a big special fist bump to
[07:38.080 --> 07:42.920]  everybody behind the scenes. You guys get forgotten. I'm a producer. I'm an editor. I
[07:42.920 --> 07:46.520]  know it how it is. I know how it goes. Big fist bump to everybody. I'm doing all
[07:46.520 --> 07:51.240]  that stuff by myself so awesome for making it easy for those guys. Let's keep
[07:51.240 --> 07:54.880]  going because obviously I'm stoned and rambling. It says I listen to the podcast
[07:54.880 --> 07:59.280]  in a loop throughout the day and soak in the info even when I already know it.
[07:59.280 --> 08:02.960]  That's a great thing. Sometimes you may catch a weird detail or something you
[08:02.960 --> 08:06.320]  didn't hear the first time and I enjoy the clicks. You're making my numbers go
[08:06.320 --> 08:10.400]  up, making my stats climb so I appreciate that and you're just filling your head
[08:10.400 --> 08:13.880]  with great knowledge so that's a good thing. It says I'm 42 years old and I'm
[08:13.880 --> 08:17.920]  growing my own plants here in VA. Do I want to say that out loud because I
[08:17.920 --> 08:21.240]  think they are illegal now. Yeah so he's growing his plants in Virginia. He's 42
[08:21.240 --> 08:25.320]  years old. He says it's hard to believe that I can legally grow and just three
[08:25.320 --> 08:30.680]  years ago not far from me this door was kicked in and I was taken to jail. Isn't
[08:30.680 --> 08:35.120]  it weird how just like just one rule or one scribble of a paper or one click of
[08:35.120 --> 08:39.320]  approval can change everything? Yeah I know what it feels like to have a chain
[08:39.320 --> 08:42.640]  put on the door and the door just flies off and a bunch of noise and commotions
[08:42.640 --> 08:46.200]  happen. You have no idea what's going on and the dogs running down the street.
[08:46.200 --> 08:48.800]  There's no front door on the house and suddenly you're on the fucking floor in
[08:48.800 --> 08:51.160]  handcuffs and all your friends are looking at you like what the fuck just
[08:51.160 --> 08:55.680]  happened but then like a week later they signed papers that say we won't do that
[08:55.680 --> 08:58.680]  anymore. You guys can smoke and grow all the weeds you want. It's fucking weird how
[08:58.760 --> 09:03.600]  paperwork's. I love it. Let's keep going. Obviously I'm stoned. It says anyway I
[09:03.600 --> 09:08.240]  have fallen in love with the plant, the plant culture and how to grow it. Dude
[09:08.240 --> 09:13.440]  welcome to my world. I am passionate about cannabis. It keeps me smiling. It
[09:13.440 --> 09:17.600]  keeps me medicated. It keeps me feeling good. It builds a good community. I've
[09:17.600 --> 09:20.920]  built a business and a lifestyle around it so I completely know how you feel
[09:20.920 --> 09:26.400]  brother. Welcome to the club. Thanks for joining us. It says it is therapeutic for
[09:26.400 --> 09:30.480]  me. It is the most therapeutic. Growing it is more therapeutic than smoking
[09:30.480 --> 09:34.160]  cannabis in my opinion. It says my question is a little different and I
[09:34.160 --> 09:39.960]  like different questions. It says how do you manage the personal aspect of this
[09:39.960 --> 09:44.640]  process? I mean socially when you meet somebody new how do you introduce this
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.400]  into the conversation? It is legal for me and I have ten of your strains and I'm
[09:49.400 --> 09:53.960]  debating which one to pop in my next run. That's a ramble but if it's a
[09:53.960 --> 09:57.920]  commitment to grow this plant properly and I don't want but it is a commitment
[09:57.920 --> 10:01.680]  to grow the plant properly and I don't want to have to constantly come up with
[10:01.680 --> 10:08.040]  excuses. I'm just curious what your thoughts may be. Well there's a couple of
[10:08.040 --> 10:11.880]  ways to go about that. It seems like the question is how do you bring up cannabis
[10:11.880 --> 10:15.720]  in your conversations in your social circle and then also how do you bring up
[10:15.720 --> 10:21.600]  that you grow cannabis in your social circle? Right now the best bet is to just
[10:21.600 --> 10:25.560]  not talk about it. Keep your mouth shut. Feel things out. Check the
[10:25.560 --> 10:30.640]  temperature. See how people are. See what the climate's like where you are. Maybe
[10:30.640 --> 10:35.040]  ask some baited questions. Don't be too obvious. Don't get yourself set up for
[10:35.040 --> 10:38.200]  anything but maybe when you're in your social circle when you're in your group
[10:38.200 --> 10:41.760]  be like you see they legalized weed and you're gonna get answers from people.
[10:41.760 --> 10:45.920]  That's all you have to do is bring it up or just be some more and let them bring
[10:45.920 --> 10:48.840]  it up. If you don't want to spark that conversation that's funny spark that
[10:48.960 --> 10:52.000]  conversation that was not on purpose. If you don't want to spark that
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.080]  conversation let them bring it up. They'll talk about it. Potheads love to
[10:56.080 --> 11:00.040]  talk about pot. You love to talk about pot so much you're emailing me to talk
[11:00.040 --> 11:04.040]  about pot to ask about how to talk about pot. So someone's gonna bring it up dude
[11:04.040 --> 11:07.600]  don't worry somebody will bring it up. Maybe you don't want to be that guy
[11:07.600 --> 11:12.920]  you're growing you're producing you've got some stuff to lose. Don't tell people
[11:12.920 --> 11:16.880]  that you don't know trust and probably love. Don't even tell people that you're
[11:16.880 --> 11:20.680]  growing. There's no need for people to know that you're growing even if it is
[11:20.680 --> 11:25.040]  legal it's still a profitable commodity. It's still a lot of work.
[11:25.040 --> 11:29.080]  People may want to steal it from you. People may want to just fuck with you
[11:29.080 --> 11:32.840]  just because maybe they don't like you from high school still and now they know
[11:32.840 --> 11:35.720]  you grow weed they want to make shit go wrong because they don't like you and
[11:35.720 --> 11:40.200]  they don't like weed now you're a target. Be careful. Don't tell anybody that you
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.800]  don't need to tell. If they don't know it's there they don't know it's there.
[11:43.800 --> 11:47.120]  Yeah if that's the bottom line if they don't know it's there they don't know
[11:47.120 --> 11:49.920]  it's there. If they don't know it's there they can't do anything about it. So
[11:49.920 --> 11:52.800]  there's gonna be two different boundaries here. Who are you going to
[11:52.800 --> 11:56.560]  talk about? There may be three different boundaries. Who do we talk about cannabis
[11:56.560 --> 12:00.360]  with? Who do we get political and have fun conversations and make them part of
[12:00.360 --> 12:03.880]  the team and be like hey I want to talk about weed and weed politics. Find some
[12:03.880 --> 12:06.400]  of those people. Then we're gonna have another layer of people. Who do we
[12:06.400 --> 12:10.720]  actually smoke with? Like because that's gonna come up once they start saying hey
[12:10.720 --> 12:13.720]  do you see there's legal weed? One person in that group is gonna go fuck yeah I'm
[12:13.720 --> 12:16.440]  so glad it's legal I've been wanting to smoke and that conversation is gonna
[12:16.440 --> 12:20.800]  happen. Don't don't say around everybody like we'll go smoke later bro. Save that.
[12:20.800 --> 12:24.000]  Wait until you break off into your own little groups or something and those
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.960]  people that don't smoke or they were not with the right ideas with you when they
[12:26.960 --> 12:30.200]  walk away and stick around and be like hey bro let's let's burn one tomorrow
[12:30.200 --> 12:33.720]  after work or whatever. You guys will figure it out. Weed heads unite. That's
[12:33.720 --> 12:37.600]  why you're here. You've already found us. So don't tell anybody that doesn't need
[12:37.600 --> 12:40.520]  to know. Now you're gonna find your social circle to talk about it. You're
[12:40.520 --> 12:44.280]  gonna find your smoking circle. Then who are you gonna share the grow with?
[12:44.280 --> 12:49.320]  Everybody knows I grow because of who I am and where I am and how what I've been
[12:49.320 --> 12:52.480]  for this community. That sounded really egotistical what I've been for this
[12:52.480 --> 12:57.200]  community. How outspoken I have been for this community. I had I was involved in
[12:57.200 --> 13:00.720]  the first dispensary in my city. I've been on the news smoking weed. News
[13:00.720 --> 13:04.760]  cameras have been at the fucking house where we smoked and shit. People know who
[13:04.760 --> 13:07.840]  I am and what I do. That's why I've got to follow the damn rules so closely now.
[13:08.560 --> 13:12.880]  But I kind of wish I wasn't under the spotlight so much sometimes under the
[13:12.880 --> 13:17.000]  magnifying glass because I will be a very good example if I need to be. So
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.160]  I've got to follow the rules very carefully. So don't make it known that
[13:21.160 --> 13:24.680]  you're growing unless you need to. Don't tell I don't know if you're married,
[13:24.680 --> 13:29.960]  single, got kids, if you got a dog. My advice right now is just tell the dog.
[13:29.960 --> 13:33.000]  The dog is the only one that needs to know. You and the dog. That's that's such
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.880]  the greatest secret that you've got. Maybe you're gonna make friends with
[13:35.880 --> 13:38.920]  somebody who's really super cool and one day you'll feel like it's time to
[13:38.920 --> 13:44.440]  share that garden. But let that be like your secret Zen thing that you've got.
[13:44.440 --> 13:48.840]  That's your new your new secret. Just your new little zone in there. When I
[13:48.840 --> 13:52.800]  was growing illegally before growing was fully legal, it was kind of like my
[13:52.800 --> 13:56.640]  little thing. Like I was like, yeah, I'm in here doing this and nobody can know
[13:56.640 --> 13:59.560]  about it. It's kind of fun to have a little private project, a little secret
[13:59.560 --> 14:07.200]  thing. If you have to make excuses, who are you making excuses to? Are you
[14:07.200 --> 14:11.240]  making excuses to go burn one? Are you making excuses because you've got to go
[14:11.240 --> 14:15.520]  water? That's one of the struggles of being a grower is having to sneak away.
[14:15.520 --> 14:19.080]  Like I got to go check on my fucking plants. Like here in Colorado, we look at
[14:19.080 --> 14:22.160]  our phone and we say, oh, my pulse monitor went off. Excuse me. I've got to
[14:22.160 --> 14:25.480]  go take care of my plants. That's my way out of a conversation or out of a boring
[14:25.480 --> 14:29.440]  situation. You're gonna have to find the opposite. You're like, oh shit, my plants
[14:29.440 --> 14:32.320]  have an issue. I got to figure out how to get out of here. You're like, my dog
[14:32.320 --> 14:36.960]  just called me. I got to go take care of my dog. Excuses are going to be harder to
[14:36.960 --> 14:41.080]  find, but be creative. Try to take care of the plants early in the morning before
[14:41.080 --> 14:44.840]  everybody else is up, before work, so you can get in there, take care of those
[14:44.840 --> 14:48.120]  plants. Nobody will interrupt you. Nobody's trying to get your attention.
[14:48.120 --> 14:51.840]  You're not cutting out of other time when people think you should be somewhere
[14:51.840 --> 14:55.360]  else. But if you got to do too much sneaky shit, that's when you got to kind
[14:55.520 --> 15:00.560]  of think about what you're doing also. So coming up with excuses, mainly just keep
[15:00.560 --> 15:03.720]  your mouth shut, bro. There's no need to tell everybody about it. Not even your
[15:03.720 --> 15:07.440]  girlfriend, not your best friends. What happens if you and that girl break up
[15:07.440 --> 15:11.560]  and she knows that girl was there? She may cause some problems for you. That
[15:11.560 --> 15:15.320]  could be a big deal. What if you tell your bro and one day he decides he's not
[15:15.320 --> 15:21.200]  your bro anymore? Like shit goes wrong, man. So be careful. You're my age. You got
[15:21.200 --> 15:25.400]  some years on you. I'm 42 as well. So maybe hopefully you got some wisdom by
[15:25.400 --> 15:29.920]  now. Hopefully you got a good group of friends, maybe a trusty friend circle, but
[15:29.920 --> 15:34.720]  still these types of things change circles. And it's a new market where you
[15:34.720 --> 15:40.360]  are there, so be very, very careful. Be very careful. Man, you maybe
[15:40.360 --> 15:43.360]  want to get in on the ground floor of these new businesses. You sound like a
[15:43.360 --> 15:47.120]  smart person and you're growing and you need people to talk to. I just got the
[15:47.120 --> 15:51.080]  idea. Open up a social smoking club or a dispensary. That's for you, brother. That's
[15:51.080 --> 15:54.640]  where you meet all kinds of people to talk to and that's also how you make a
[15:54.640 --> 15:58.120]  business out of something you love and then it gets legal and then you don't
[15:58.120 --> 16:00.720]  even have to explain it to people. They'll go, that's the guy with the
[16:00.720 --> 16:04.360]  dispensary downtown and he'll be providing a service that makes you feel
[16:04.360 --> 16:07.520]  good that you're passionate about and that's what life is all about. That came
[16:07.520 --> 16:10.000]  to me at the end of that message. I'm glad I let that one come through me.
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.720]  Alright, bro, thank you for the great message. I hope I answered that question.
[16:13.720 --> 16:19.240]  How do I handle the social aspect of this? Let it evolve naturally and mostly
[16:19.240 --> 16:23.520]  keep your mouth shut. Don't tell too many people because it's fun to smoke
[16:23.520 --> 16:26.480]  with other people but sounds like you've been smoking by yourself for a long time
[16:26.480 --> 16:29.640]  and that you can keep doing that bro until somebody until somebody else
[16:29.640 --> 16:33.960]  admits that they're a smoker then bring them in. Kyle, thank you brother. That's a
[16:33.960 --> 16:38.400]  great message. I look forward to taking a fat dab with you someday. Alright, man.
[16:38.400 --> 16:42.600]  Let's move on to the next message. This one came from a friend who is calling
[16:42.600 --> 16:46.960]  themselves trike man. I don't know that if I've ever met trike man before.
[16:46.960 --> 16:51.840]  Sounds like a super cool superhero name. Big shout out to trike man. I'm trying to
[16:51.840 --> 16:56.600]  picture your superhero costume. It's definitely sticky. It gets amber as you
[16:56.600 --> 17:00.680]  get fucking angry or super powered. Starts off clear and your power builds
[17:00.680 --> 17:04.560]  up and starts getting amber. That's what trike man would do in my mind. I told
[17:04.560 --> 17:08.440]  you. I took some dabs and I'm high. Alright, let's read this message. It says,
[17:08.440 --> 17:12.000]  I hope all is well, buddy. Obviously things are well, bro. It's a little bit
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.360]  warm. Other than that, things are ivory. It says, big ups to the ivory army. It's
[17:16.440 --> 17:20.440]  trike man here and I got a little question about stabilizing genetics with
[17:20.440 --> 17:25.000]  reversing females. That is a great topic. Sounds like a big mouthful but it's
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.720]  really not that much to think about. Stabilizing genetics. Basically the goal,
[17:29.720 --> 17:33.720]  I think, when you are talking about stabilizing is growing a population of
[17:33.720 --> 17:38.240]  seeds and hoping that they come out uniform. They look the same. That's what I
[17:38.240 --> 17:41.240]  think you're saying when you say stabilizing genetics. And then with
[17:41.240 --> 17:46.040]  reversing females. So that is taking a female plant and using silver thiosulfate
[17:46.600 --> 17:51.080]  or colloidal silver to induce that plant to create pollen sacs and then
[17:51.080 --> 17:54.840]  pollinating female plants with that. Which I do like the idea. That is a very
[17:54.840 --> 18:01.000]  good way to stabilize and lock in traits without opening up Pandora's box. It
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.960]  says, so here's a little example of what I am curious about. Say I start by
[18:05.960 --> 18:10.360]  making my cross with a male and a female. Alright, we've got a plant. Next,
[18:10.360 --> 18:14.680]  I search for what my goal in that breeding project was. Alright, so we've
[18:14.680 --> 18:18.440]  got the phenotype that was our goal. That's beautiful. Then from there, I
[18:18.440 --> 18:24.120]  want to reverse that female that I selected and breed that to itself. So
[18:24.120 --> 18:28.440]  now we've made a plant that is beautiful. This is a very common thing. We made
[18:28.440 --> 18:32.440]  some seeds. We found a plant that's beautiful. Now our friend wants to take
[18:32.440 --> 18:35.800]  two clones of this plant. So we're basically going to cut a branch here and
[18:35.800 --> 18:39.800]  a branch here and we got two cuts of the same plant. We're going to reverse one
[18:39.800 --> 18:43.400]  using the reversal method that I've talked about in previous episodes. Either
[18:43.400 --> 18:47.560]  silver thiosulfate or colloidal silver. Then we're going to put the pollen that
[18:47.560 --> 18:51.560]  comes from that plant onto the other plant. So we've just reversed one,
[18:51.560 --> 18:58.040]  pollinated one. We have now made an S1 or maybe a feminized F1. Some people may
[18:58.040 --> 19:01.480]  say we're going to talk about that in depth in the future here. Maybe get some
[19:01.480 --> 19:08.120]  other folks on the show, but I digress. So I'm going to catch up in the message.
[19:08.120 --> 19:12.120]  Search for what my goal was. From there, I want to reverse that female and breed
[19:12.120 --> 19:17.080]  it to itself. Makes perfect sense so far. My question is, do I breed the next
[19:17.080 --> 19:23.800]  generation to the first generation I reversed the first time or do I reverse
[19:23.800 --> 19:30.040]  the next generation and cross it to a clone of itself again and keep doing that
[19:30.040 --> 19:35.240]  or keep breeding the next generation to the first female I selected and reversed?
[19:35.960 --> 19:39.480]  Thank you for everything you do, buddy. I hope you feel iry about the rest of
[19:39.480 --> 19:44.360]  your days. Respect from trike man. Big respect, bro. This is a great question.
[19:44.360 --> 19:51.480]  I've got a couple of good answers. My first answer is yes. Do all that shit.
[19:51.480 --> 19:55.880]  Do all of it. That's how you're going to find what works the best is do all of
[19:55.880 --> 19:58.760]  that. Now I do have some more in-depth answers to this because I know you want
[19:58.760 --> 20:06.200]  more details. You want to continue breeding with this. Now, excuse all the
[20:06.200 --> 20:08.600]  throat clearing. I've been talking about those dabs. Now we're at the phase where
[20:08.600 --> 20:13.960]  they fuck up my throat. So what you've got is a feminized F1 or it's an S1
[20:13.960 --> 20:19.400]  because it's been selfed. That is going to be fairly uniform or fairly stable.
[20:19.400 --> 20:23.960]  In my experience, if you've selected good plants or a good plant is what this
[20:23.960 --> 20:29.560]  would be, you're probably going to get approximately 50 to 70% of your plants
[20:29.560 --> 20:36.120]  that look like your starter plant. And then probably 50 is a possibility, but
[20:36.120 --> 20:40.600]  50 to 30% of those plants are going to look a little bit like the mother that
[20:40.600 --> 20:44.200]  was used to make that plant and the father that was used to make that plant.
[20:44.200 --> 20:47.960]  So you're going to have a pretty good lock in already on your first cross. When
[20:47.960 --> 20:53.800]  we start doing the next cross is when we kind of unlock weird shit. Sometimes we
[20:53.800 --> 20:59.320]  get F2 variation is when you start seeing weird things when you do breeding.
[20:59.320 --> 21:04.280]  So you do the F1, you get that hybrid vigor. You do the F2. Sometimes you'll
[21:04.280 --> 21:09.640]  find plants that outperform the original cross. You find good parent stock from
[21:09.640 --> 21:14.920]  F2 and make the F3 and that's when you really start locking in those, the
[21:14.920 --> 21:18.440]  stability, those traits that you're looking for. The uniformity is what the
[21:18.440 --> 21:23.320]  word I think I was looking for. So you may open up Pandora's box and make shit
[21:23.320 --> 21:29.880]  go weird by doing more breeding to this reversed F1 or this S1 that you've got.
[21:29.880 --> 21:33.960]  So you do have two very useful, very viable options that you could have great
[21:33.960 --> 21:40.760]  success with. You could either take two of those S1s or it's a F1, yeah, it's a
[21:40.760 --> 21:45.240]  selfed F1. We're still debating on the names of and the lettering and labeling
[21:45.240 --> 21:48.840]  of all this. So you could take a batch of those seeds and grow them and find a
[21:48.840 --> 21:52.760]  male and a female or I guess find an ideal female in there or you could find
[21:52.760 --> 21:56.600]  an ideal two females and you can cross that however you'd like. You could find
[21:56.600 --> 22:01.080]  one and reself it or you can find two and cross those together and make the
[22:01.080 --> 22:05.960]  next generation however you'd like or you can do that back cross. You can take
[22:05.960 --> 22:10.440]  something from the second generation and put it back to that first generation you
[22:10.440 --> 22:14.440]  made or back to one of those parents. Now here is something that I don't talk
[22:14.440 --> 22:19.480]  about a lot but here's something I discovered on accident. I took a plant
[22:19.480 --> 22:22.360]  and it was a beautiful plant. It was amazing. I loved it. It was everything I
[22:22.360 --> 22:29.240]  was looking for in a plant. I reversed it. I made feminized F1s or S1s out of that
[22:29.320 --> 22:33.640]  plant. So I've got my feminized seed stock and I did sort of what you're
[22:33.640 --> 22:37.400]  thinking about doing. I found the winner out of that. Number nine was the keeper.
[22:38.200 --> 22:43.560]  I took number nine and then I took the original pollen from the first making of
[22:43.560 --> 22:48.600]  that seed and I pollinated number nine with the pollen from its mom. So that
[22:48.600 --> 22:53.800]  reversed pollen went on number nine. It was basically the mom went on to the
[22:53.800 --> 22:58.120]  daughter essentially and the offspring that came from that were labeled number
[22:58.120 --> 23:03.000]  77. The good one, my favorite one that came out of that was labeled number 77.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.160]  I was calling the whole batch the 77s. That was related to some other stuff is
[23:07.160 --> 23:12.760]  why I got that number and if you know why, big shout out. Hey now. So number
[23:12.760 --> 23:18.120]  77 would not reverse. So depending on what your goal is, if you want to keep
[23:18.120 --> 23:23.160]  moving forward, you may be stuck because I can't breed. I couldn't breed with
[23:23.160 --> 23:26.920]  77 for a long time because it wouldn't turn around. I could not reverse it to
[23:26.920 --> 23:31.000]  make pollen from it. So I feel like I trapped myself. I cut off my breeding
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.280]  project right there. The way that I did that, I'll repeat that process because
[23:34.280 --> 23:39.960]  I probably got your attention more now. I made the feminized cross just like
[23:39.960 --> 23:45.160]  you did. I took a plant, took two clones, pollen and pollen receiver that made
[23:45.160 --> 23:49.560]  seeds. I took a seed from that batch and I found a stellar keeper that looked a
[23:49.560 --> 23:53.960]  lot like the original plant I started with. I took the pollen from the original
[23:53.960 --> 23:58.840]  mom and put that onto the daughter plant and the offspring, the granddaughters
[23:58.840 --> 24:02.600]  that came out, that'd be mommy, daughter, granddaughter at that point, right? The
[24:02.600 --> 24:06.520]  granddaughters don't reverse. I can't flip them. They don't. If I spray them
[24:06.520 --> 24:10.600]  with silver thiosulfate, they don't react the way that most plants react. I feel
[24:10.600 --> 24:15.240]  like I really locked in the feminized side of that plant to where I can't even
[24:15.240 --> 24:19.560]  get it to reverse now. That's how stubbornly feminized that plant is. So be
[24:19.560 --> 24:23.400]  careful. You may trap yourself. You may end your breeding right there. You'll
[24:23.400 --> 24:26.520]  have to go backwards. You'll say, well, I can't reverse this thing. It won't
[24:26.520 --> 24:31.160]  flip. You can do all of these ways that you want to do it. It depends on the
[24:31.160 --> 24:35.080]  traits that you're searching for. Are the traits that you're looking for, so
[24:35.080 --> 24:40.280]  you've made the S1 or the feminized F1, are the traits you're looking for
[24:40.280 --> 24:43.880]  showing very commonly? Are they prominent? Are they dominant? Are they
[24:43.880 --> 24:48.120]  popping up a lot? So deciding the next move is all about where are the traits
[24:48.120 --> 24:52.200]  that you're looking for? Do you see the trait you're looking for in a lot of the
[24:52.200 --> 24:56.280]  seeds you've got? Do you see the traits you're looking for in the mother plant
[24:56.280 --> 24:59.640]  that you started with? Do you see the traits you're looking for maybe in the
[24:59.640 --> 25:03.640]  father plant that was the original pollen donor in the original non-feminized
[25:03.640 --> 25:08.680]  cross? Where is the trait? What are you looking for? Get that trait, get that
[25:08.680 --> 25:12.200]  ingredient, and then breed that direction. I wish I had a better, more
[25:12.200 --> 25:16.680]  solid answer, but I don't know which plants look the best and which plants
[25:16.680 --> 25:22.280]  have your goal, but that is the plant you need. You are on the right track.
[25:22.280 --> 25:26.120]  You've got a lot of good ideas, and I know I said it earlier, the answer is yes,
[25:26.120 --> 25:30.120]  and the answer is to do all of this. It's really hard to decide what to do
[25:30.120 --> 25:32.520]  sometimes. I'm going to read it again and see if I can give you a better
[25:32.520 --> 25:36.760]  definitive answer, but without looking at the plants and without saying,
[25:36.760 --> 25:40.440]  this one's got that strawberry terp that I'm after, or this one's got that purple
[25:40.440 --> 25:45.000]  color that I'm after, it's hard to pick for you, but go for the plants that have
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.960]  the traits which you were looking for, and then keep locking in that trait, and
[25:49.960 --> 25:53.720]  then deciding. So yeah, if you want to move forward with the feminized
[25:53.720 --> 25:58.280]  generations or go back to another plant, where are the ingredients that you need?
[25:58.280 --> 26:02.360]  Are they forward? Are they back there somewhere? Do the seeds show you what you
[26:02.360 --> 26:06.040]  want, or do you need to put another ingredient in there? The only way to
[26:06.040 --> 26:09.720]  figure it out, really honestly, is to breed it and grow them. I'm going to scan
[26:09.720 --> 26:12.680]  over the message real quick and make sure that I got the answer to this.
[26:12.680 --> 26:16.280]  All right, I think I more than covered the answer to this question. It's all
[26:16.280 --> 26:20.680]  about finding where the traits are that you want to lock in, and then use those
[26:20.680 --> 26:25.320]  plants to create the results that you want. I think you'd find great results in
[26:25.320 --> 26:30.600]  the S2 generation. I also think you'd find great results in the, it would be a
[26:30.600 --> 26:34.600]  reversed backcross. I think you'd find great results in both of those. It's all
[26:34.600 --> 26:39.320]  about your goal. Play with both of them if you can. Honestly, you're going to
[26:39.320 --> 26:43.720]  have great results with that very first feminized cross. That's when you're
[26:43.720 --> 26:47.720]  going to see great results. It's not going to be wonky or problematic or
[26:47.720 --> 26:51.720]  anything like that. You're not going to find a bunch of mutants unless, unless
[26:51.720 --> 26:56.280]  your starting plants were wonky and mutants. But I think, you sound like a
[26:56.280 --> 27:00.440]  smart guy. It sounds like you probably did good selection. It sounds like you're
[27:00.440 --> 27:04.120]  thinking ahead, which is very great, because a lot of breeders don't do that.
[27:04.120 --> 27:09.400]  But I think you're on the right path, and I think it's just the plants are
[27:09.400 --> 27:12.920]  going to tell you, man. I wish I had a better answer. I wish I could tell you do
[27:12.920 --> 27:16.120]  three shakes of this ingredient, three shakes of this, and it'll work. But it's
[27:16.120 --> 27:20.040]  all about seeing those plants. Which way do you need to go? What are the plants
[27:20.040 --> 27:23.960]  showing you? What are the parents showing you? Grow it all out. See what you've
[27:23.960 --> 27:27.400]  got. Get very familiar with all of the plants, and then you'll know what they're
[27:27.400 --> 27:31.560]  going to do. You'll just be able to tell. Like if you grow this, this female plant
[27:31.560 --> 27:34.840]  so many times, and this female plant so many times, and you cross this one to
[27:34.840 --> 27:37.960]  this one, and this one to this one, and that one to that one, you'll start
[27:37.960 --> 27:41.960]  knowing what this plant contributes to crosses, and you'll start being able to
[27:41.960 --> 27:46.760]  predict it. It's almost, it almost becomes predictable once you've bred with a
[27:46.760 --> 27:51.320]  bunch of plants so many times. All right. My friend Trike Man, thank you for the
[27:51.320 --> 27:54.760]  great question, bro. I do look forward to the response from this. If you've got
[27:54.760 --> 27:57.960]  any more follow-up questions, please do ask. I feel like I got kind of carried
[27:57.960 --> 28:03.560]  away and rambly, so I hope I was clear. Again, I do look forward to the reply.
[28:03.560 --> 28:08.280]  The email address, of course, you know it, is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[28:08.280 --> 28:12.520]  Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[28:12.520 --> 28:16.360]  clone cutters, and pollen chuckers, it is time for me to wrap up this episode. I
[28:16.360 --> 28:21.160]  want to thank everybody once again for listening to episode 668 of the Grow
[28:21.160 --> 28:25.560]  From Your Heart podcast. It blows my mind every time I write down a number like
[28:25.640 --> 28:30.760]  668. It's crazy to me that we've gotten this far. Thank you for all of the
[28:30.760 --> 28:33.720]  support. Once again, if you have any questions, corrections, comments, or
[28:33.720 --> 28:36.760]  concerns, you know I would love to hear from you. The email address is
[28:36.760 --> 28:41.400]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com. Don't be shy. I've been enjoying the listener
[28:41.400 --> 28:45.720]  interaction. It has been a great time. Speaking of interaction, join us on
[28:45.720 --> 28:49.640]  Discord. When I get done recording here, I've got to wait for this camera and
[28:49.640 --> 28:53.640]  that camera to load up to the computer. It takes a little while for them to load
[28:53.640 --> 28:57.320]  into the computer before I can even begin to edit. While they load up, I'm
[28:57.320 --> 29:01.000]  going to go hang out in Discord, take a couple of dabs, check in with the crew,
[29:01.640 --> 29:04.600]  show them some new merch designs that I've got going. So they're going to see
[29:04.600 --> 29:08.120]  the merch while I'm on the live feed hanging out. They'll get to approve,
[29:08.680 --> 29:12.280]  disapprove some things, give me some feedback. So that's where I will be.
[29:12.280 --> 29:16.200]  Join me on the Discord. I may be there right now when you're watching this.
[29:16.200 --> 29:19.640]  Check it out. I might be hanging out. Also, make sure you check out the Patreon
[29:20.360 --> 29:26.280]  at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart. I think that is all I've got for you.
[29:26.280 --> 29:29.880]  Make sure you click like. Make sure you subscribe. Click on that little notification
[29:29.880 --> 29:34.680]  bell. That way, every time I put out an episode, you do get a notification. The episodes do come
[29:34.680 --> 29:43.000]  out at midnight Monday and at midnight Thursday. That's 1201 Monday and 1201 Thursday. So check
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.600]  us out. We will be on YouTube doing premieres. I do hang out in the chat on YouTube. Sometimes
[29:48.600 --> 29:53.000]  I'm in the chat on YouTube chatting with the friends, watching the video happen.
[29:53.000 --> 29:58.600]  And I'm also in Discord taking dabs with those guys. I'm also in another chat hanging out. So
[29:58.600 --> 30:04.840]  I try to be as interactive as I can when I'm available. Summer has had me busy, not complaining.
[30:04.840 --> 30:10.520]  I love it. Comedy and concerts are back. Look at my smile. All right. I'm getting rambly once again.
[30:10.520 --> 30:14.680]  Big shout out to Dabs. That is all I've got for this episode. You know I'll be back in a couple
[30:14.680 --> 30:19.320]  of days with fresh new content. I want to give a big shout out to my friend Girls Grow Too.
[30:19.320 --> 30:38.760]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
