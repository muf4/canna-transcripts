[00:00.120 --> 00:15.120]  Oh shit, lost a Jeff in the house.
[00:15.120 --> 00:34.960]  Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[00:34.960 --> 00:38.440]  It's Thursday and that means it's time for another throwback Thursday episode of the
[00:38.440 --> 00:40.680]  Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:40.680 --> 00:43.640]  Before we get to the old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:43.640 --> 00:48.080]  If I mention any advertising, any giveaways, any promotions or any contests, all of that
[00:48.080 --> 00:49.400]  stuff has expired.
[00:49.400 --> 00:54.640]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:54.640 --> 00:58.680]  I want to thank you guys for listening and with no further ado, here's a block of old
[00:58.680 --> 01:01.040]  episodes of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:01.040 --> 01:16.670]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[01:16.670 --> 01:21.350]  It's time for episode number 129 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:21.350 --> 01:22.350]  news, education and conversation.
[01:22.350 --> 01:27.150]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a
[01:27.150 --> 01:31.430]  new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's
[01:31.430 --> 01:36.230]  just curious about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:36.230 --> 01:38.230]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:38.230 --> 01:40.430]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:40.430 --> 01:43.750]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[01:43.750 --> 01:46.710]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:46.710 --> 01:52.590]  Big shout out to Kat, Koon and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:52.590 --> 01:54.390]  This episode is going to be coming out on April 18th.
[01:54.390 --> 01:59.590]  I hope everybody is in the middle of a happy, amazing celebration for the 420 weekend.
[01:59.590 --> 02:03.590]  With 420 being on a Wednesday, I'm sure a lot of people started celebrating Friday evening,
[02:03.590 --> 02:05.750]  Friday at 420 when they got off work.
[02:05.750 --> 02:09.950]  So if you're having a great 420 weekend, wherever you are, whatever you're doing, I hope you
[02:09.950 --> 02:10.950]  got a fat blunt roll.
[02:10.950 --> 02:11.950]  I hope you're taking a fat dab.
[02:11.950 --> 02:12.950]  Hope you've eaten some edibles.
[02:12.950 --> 02:15.390]  Maybe you're taking a fat bong rip.
[02:15.390 --> 02:18.590]  However you like to consume your cannabis, I hope you are doing it.
[02:18.590 --> 02:21.750]  It's kind of weird without the Cannabis Cup here in Denver this year.
[02:21.750 --> 02:22.750]  Everybody's spread out.
[02:22.750 --> 02:23.750]  I don't know where the party is.
[02:23.750 --> 02:26.430]  I don't know where everybody's going to be, but I know where I am going to be.
[02:26.430 --> 02:27.430]  That's right.
[02:27.430 --> 02:28.430]  I will be at the Secret Sesh.
[02:28.430 --> 02:32.310]  If you want to learn more about the Secret Sesh hosted by my friend Adam Ill, I also
[02:32.310 --> 02:35.390]  heard a rumor DJ Juggie would be DJing the event.
[02:35.390 --> 02:38.230]  Make sure you check out Secret Sesh Colorado on Instagram.
[02:38.230 --> 02:40.710]  I cannot do anything to get you tickets.
[02:40.710 --> 02:44.870]  I was lucky enough to get myself one ticket because of course I am family.
[02:44.870 --> 02:45.870]  I've got one for myself.
[02:45.870 --> 02:46.870]  That's all I've got.
[02:46.870 --> 02:47.870]  I apologize.
[02:47.870 --> 02:49.270]  I cannot help you get in.
[02:49.270 --> 02:51.390]  I can't do anything for you.
[02:51.390 --> 02:55.270]  Figure out how to find their Instagram and then there are instructions on their Instagram
[02:55.270 --> 02:58.270]  on how to try to get yourself into the event.
[02:58.270 --> 03:00.070]  By the time this airs, it may be full.
[03:00.070 --> 03:01.070]  So good luck.
[03:01.070 --> 03:02.070]  I hope to see you there.
[03:02.070 --> 03:06.310]  I want to talk about something that I saw on the cannabis just recently.
[03:06.310 --> 03:10.590]  This is a little bit related to the Cannabis Cup not being here in Denver.
[03:10.590 --> 03:14.630]  It looks like a lot of people kind of backed out on coming to Colorado without the giant
[03:14.630 --> 03:18.910]  Cannabis Cup, but I'm going to read an article from the Cannabis and the headline goes like
[03:18.910 --> 03:24.630]  this Cypress Hills Cannabis Cup concert just moved to a much smaller venue.
[03:24.630 --> 03:29.150]  The sub headline says, I think that's called the byline that says fewer people will be
[03:29.150 --> 03:32.590]  getting insane in the brain for 420 this week.
[03:32.590 --> 03:36.950]  Then this article is by Ricardo Baca, of course from the Cannabis and it says, and the hits
[03:36.950 --> 03:39.310]  to the Cannabis Cup in Colorado keep coming.
[03:39.310 --> 03:43.050]  First the US Cannabis Cup got booted from its Denver adjacent home and it's planned
[03:43.050 --> 03:45.570]  to stage a cup in Southern Colorado fell apart.
[03:45.570 --> 03:49.550]  Then High Times Magazine's largest event moved from Colorado for a greener, more lenient
[03:49.550 --> 03:52.050]  home in Southern California.
[03:52.050 --> 03:56.610]  And now the cups alone, Colorado event, High Times sponsored concert with Cypress Hill,
[03:56.610 --> 04:01.430]  George Clinton and others with a Cannabis Cup award show tagged on is moving to a much
[04:01.430 --> 04:04.530]  smaller venue less than a week before showtime.
[04:04.530 --> 04:07.710]  And even with, excuse me, let me try that sentence again.
[04:07.710 --> 04:12.210]  And even with the move to the smaller venue, tickets are still available.
[04:12.210 --> 04:17.010]  Instead of playing the 6,500 capacity first bank center in Broomfield, the Cypress Hill
[04:17.010 --> 04:23.090]  concert and High Times award show is moving to the 1,700 capacity Ogden theater in Denver.
[04:23.090 --> 04:27.130]  According to promoter AEG live, all tickets for the first bank center are good for the
[04:27.130 --> 04:30.890]  Ogden and a limited number of tickets remain and are on sale.
[04:30.890 --> 04:35.130]  Now, according to a media release, the tickets are $65.
[04:35.130 --> 04:39.490]  The bills, other acts or George Clinton and parliament, Funkadelic action, Bronson and
[04:39.490 --> 04:40.490]  the Chronics.
[04:40.490 --> 04:42.610]  You guys, you've heard Chronics on this podcast.
[04:42.610 --> 04:44.850]  I might write it down to end of the show with Chronics.
[04:44.850 --> 04:46.450]  I'm going to put a little note on myself.
[04:46.450 --> 04:47.450]  There we go.
[04:47.450 --> 04:48.450]  I'll probably end the podcast with Chronics.
[04:48.450 --> 04:50.970]  It's one of my favorite reggae artists.
[04:50.970 --> 04:53.010]  Chronics with two X's at the end.
[04:53.010 --> 04:55.090]  Make sure you check that out.
[04:55.090 --> 04:56.210]  Great artist.
[04:56.210 --> 04:59.410]  I wasn't going to go to this show you guys, because it was at the first bank center.
[04:59.410 --> 05:00.490]  It's kind of a big event.
[05:00.490 --> 05:01.490]  It's kind of a big venue.
[05:01.490 --> 05:05.090]  Unless you're up in the front and those big venues, it's just a party and you don't even
[05:05.090 --> 05:06.690]  really get to see the concert.
[05:06.690 --> 05:10.850]  The artist I want to see is the least known artist on the bill.
[05:10.850 --> 05:11.850]  He's going to play first.
[05:11.850 --> 05:17.010]  He'll probably get like 30 minutes to play, but in a small venue like that, it might be
[05:17.010 --> 05:18.010]  worth it for me to go.
[05:18.010 --> 05:21.810]  When you're six, five and you got dreadlocks down to your ass and a reggae band starts
[05:21.810 --> 05:24.610]  playing and you know all the words and you walk toward the front, people move the fuck
[05:24.610 --> 05:25.610]  out of your way.
[05:25.610 --> 05:27.410]  I would just go right up front and check out Chronics.
[05:27.410 --> 05:29.370]  Then I'd be gone by the time.
[05:29.370 --> 05:31.490]  I might check out action, Bronson and parliament, Funkadelic.
[05:31.490 --> 05:32.490]  That'd be fun.
[05:32.490 --> 05:35.330]  Yeah, I'd stick around and see the rest of it if I paid 65 for a ticket.
[05:35.330 --> 05:36.330]  I just want to go see Chronics.
[05:36.970 --> 05:38.610]  I'd be a great time in that little tiny club.
[05:38.610 --> 05:41.250]  I'm going to continue with this article here.
[05:41.250 --> 05:43.610]  It says, so why didn't the event sell?
[05:43.610 --> 05:46.970]  Surely the lack of a company in Cannabis Cup Expo didn't help ticket sales.
[05:46.970 --> 05:51.090]  And with Snoop Dogg playing Fiddler's Green, Wiz Khalifa and Lil Wayne playing the 420
[05:51.090 --> 05:56.150]  rally and Method Man and Redman playing Red Rocks all in the same week, competition is
[05:56.150 --> 05:58.090]  no doubt fierce.
[05:58.090 --> 06:01.890]  Is this venue downsizing indicative of the 420 to come?
[06:01.890 --> 06:07.370]  It's too early to say, but Colorado will surely see fewer cannabis tourists this 420
[06:07.370 --> 06:10.010]  because of the cups move west.
[06:10.010 --> 06:11.010]  That is absolutely true.
[06:11.010 --> 06:14.890]  A lot of my friends that normally would come out to Colorado for the 420 weekend from California,
[06:14.890 --> 06:20.050]  from Oregon, from Washington, from Michigan, from all over the damn place, from North Carolina,
[06:20.050 --> 06:22.610]  they're not coming out because there's no Cannabis Cup this year.
[06:22.610 --> 06:27.210]  There are a lot of vendors that I'd like to hang out with that probably I will not see
[06:27.210 --> 06:31.530]  this year because we usually bump into each other either at the Cannabis Cup or Age.
[06:32.170 --> 06:34.890]  So unless they're at Age in the winter or the fall time, I will not see them.
[06:34.890 --> 06:40.650]  A shout out to the Oil Slick crew, Handmade crew, the Hitman Glass crew, Task and Highly
[06:40.650 --> 06:43.050]  Educated, everybody that shows up at all the events.
[06:43.050 --> 06:46.170]  There's one group in my head that I'm thinking of that I cannot think of, Johnny B and the
[06:46.170 --> 06:47.170]  No Goo crew.
[06:47.170 --> 06:49.010]  How did I forget about those guys?
[06:49.010 --> 06:51.370]  See all those guys, I'm going to miss seeing them at the cup this year.
[06:51.370 --> 06:54.130]  Johnny B, I hear you'll be on the road with the Goo Mobile.
[06:54.130 --> 06:55.570]  I hope to see you.
[06:55.570 --> 06:59.530]  Hap Cant, Jules, all kinds of folks that I'm not going to get to see because there's no
[06:59.530 --> 07:00.530]  Cannabis Cup.
[07:00.530 --> 07:01.530]  That sucks.
[07:01.530 --> 07:05.130]  I feel like I'm just ranting and screaming about not getting a Cannabis Cup.
[07:05.130 --> 07:06.130]  I feel like a little bitch suddenly.
[07:06.130 --> 07:08.050]  I'll quit whining about that.
[07:08.050 --> 07:09.610]  This concert, you guys, it sounds like a lot of fun.
[07:09.610 --> 07:13.210]  They've moved it to the small venue, but they did put out a press release and it says you
[07:13.210 --> 07:15.370]  cannot medicate in this facility.
[07:15.370 --> 07:17.810]  So there will be no ganja smoking.
[07:17.810 --> 07:18.810]  That's what they say.
[07:18.810 --> 07:21.130]  They always say that kind of shit at these events.
[07:21.130 --> 07:23.810]  But this venue is tiny and they can see you from all angles.
[07:23.810 --> 07:25.890]  So I don't know what they're going to do.
[07:25.890 --> 07:29.650]  If one person starts puffing and then two people start and then the whole place is smoking,
[07:29.770 --> 07:31.530]  they can't kick everybody out.
[07:31.530 --> 07:34.050]  But at the same time, you never know what they're going to try to do.
[07:34.050 --> 07:35.050]  They're going to say no smoking.
[07:35.050 --> 07:37.050]  They'll probably just let you do it in there anyway.
[07:37.050 --> 07:38.050]  Oh, sorry.
[07:38.050 --> 07:39.410]  I'm burping while I'm recording a podcast.
[07:39.410 --> 07:40.770]  Shout out to Dr. Pepper.
[07:40.770 --> 07:41.770]  23 flavors.
[07:41.770 --> 07:42.770]  Love it.
[07:42.770 --> 07:43.770]  Got to have it.
[07:43.770 --> 07:45.930]  All right, you guys, that was my my news article.
[07:45.930 --> 07:47.570]  I'm not going to read any more news in this episode.
[07:47.570 --> 07:52.650]  I'll go ahead and close that web browser and we will go ahead and focus on some emails.
[07:52.650 --> 07:59.010]  I did an episode about listener emails and that spawned more emails.
[07:59.370 --> 08:01.130]  They sent me a message about a probiotic.
[08:01.130 --> 08:02.890]  I mentioned that I like to consume probiotics.
[08:02.890 --> 08:05.210]  I like kombuchas and fermented products.
[08:05.210 --> 08:06.890]  I think they're good for digestion.
[08:06.890 --> 08:10.610]  I have some stomach problems, which is part of why I have a medical marijuana recommendation.
[08:10.610 --> 08:12.730]  It'll talk a lot about that.
[08:12.730 --> 08:16.290]  I don't think anybody really wants to hear about my medical conditions, but my stomach
[08:16.290 --> 08:17.290]  is messed up.
[08:17.290 --> 08:18.290]  It's wrecked.
[08:18.290 --> 08:19.290]  I like to take probiotics.
[08:19.290 --> 08:20.290]  It makes me feel like my food digests better.
[08:20.290 --> 08:21.370]  It makes me feel like my body's better.
[08:21.370 --> 08:25.610]  I think your gut health has a lot to do with your mental health and your physical health.
[08:25.610 --> 08:26.690]  So it all starts in the gut.
[08:26.690 --> 08:28.770]  So probiotics and good food.
[08:29.530 --> 08:32.690]  One of our listeners sent me an email asking about a specific probiotic.
[08:32.690 --> 08:34.450]  And to tell you the truth, I lost the message.
[08:34.450 --> 08:36.890]  I cannot find where that message came in.
[08:36.890 --> 08:40.770]  I can't find it on the Facebook pages, the Instagram.
[08:40.770 --> 08:43.410]  I can't find it in any of my emails.
[08:43.410 --> 08:46.690]  You asked if I had heard about a product or if I am familiar with the product.
[08:46.690 --> 08:48.610]  Honestly, I've never heard of that product.
[08:48.610 --> 08:52.490]  I intended to save the message you sent and go and research that product and tell you
[08:52.490 --> 08:53.490]  what I thought about it.
[08:53.490 --> 08:55.650]  But honestly, I don't know what happened to the damn message.
[08:55.650 --> 08:58.890]  So if you sent me that message, let's do this easier.
[08:58.890 --> 09:02.890]  Send me it again on an email at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[09:02.890 --> 09:04.930]  That way I'll find it.
[09:04.930 --> 09:07.970]  And I will read your email again and I will research that product.
[09:07.970 --> 09:10.210]  And I do apologize for losing the damn email.
[09:10.210 --> 09:11.410]  It drove me crazy.
[09:11.410 --> 09:13.690]  I spent about two hours just searching for that email.
[09:13.690 --> 09:16.850]  Seriously, not all at one time, but I put about two hours into looking for that thing
[09:16.850 --> 09:18.370]  probably and I can't find the message.
[09:18.370 --> 09:19.370]  So I apologize.
[09:19.370 --> 09:20.370]  Send it again.
[09:20.370 --> 09:21.370]  I will answer.
[09:21.370 --> 09:22.370]  All right.
[09:22.370 --> 09:23.370]  All right.
[09:23.370 --> 09:25.930]  So the next email comes from, I'm opening the message right now.
[09:25.930 --> 09:28.050]  This message came from a friend of ours.
[09:28.050 --> 09:32.330]  I'm not sure if he wants me to say his name, so I'm not going to, but it says, I'm a new
[09:32.330 --> 09:34.450]  listener to the show and I got to say I'm a huge fan.
[09:34.450 --> 09:38.210]  I'm very thankful for the wealth of information you provide and all the knowledgeable guests
[09:38.210 --> 09:39.210]  you bring on.
[09:39.210 --> 09:42.450]  I am listening from another state at the moment, but have plans on moving to Colorado soon
[09:42.450 --> 09:45.610]  to get involved in the industry any way I can.
[09:45.610 --> 09:49.570]  I listened to the episode about the MED badges and I just had a few more questions.
[09:49.570 --> 09:53.610]  If you have your MED badge, does that mean you can go into a medical dispensary as a
[09:53.610 --> 09:55.930]  customer to buy products as well?
[09:55.930 --> 09:57.090]  Or is that a different card?
[09:57.090 --> 09:59.050]  I hope that makes sense, but think again.
[09:59.050 --> 10:00.450]  Thanks again for everything.
[10:00.450 --> 10:02.690]  And I look forward to meeting you one day.
[10:02.690 --> 10:05.690]  Well, I look forward to meeting you too.
[10:05.690 --> 10:07.130]  I hope we get to take some fat dabs.
[10:07.130 --> 10:08.930]  Hopefully smoke some flowers together.
[10:08.930 --> 10:12.890]  I would like to see what kind of flowers you are getting in your location and I'll show
[10:12.890 --> 10:16.330]  you what kind of flowers we've got here and we can smoke down together.
[10:16.330 --> 10:17.330]  You're a new listener.
[10:17.370 --> 10:20.610]  I encourage you to go back and listen to a few of the older episodes if you're a new
[10:20.610 --> 10:21.610]  listener.
[10:21.610 --> 10:24.530]  Listen to, I think it's 50, 55.
[10:24.530 --> 10:28.890]  Then there's an episode about scheduling your grow, scheduling a perpetual grow.
[10:28.890 --> 10:30.850]  There's episodes about building your garden.
[10:30.850 --> 10:34.650]  I strongly recommend listening to some of those more educational, in-depth, informative
[10:34.650 --> 10:36.810]  episodes.
[10:36.810 --> 10:37.810]  What else did you say here?
[10:37.810 --> 10:38.810]  You're very thankful.
[10:38.810 --> 10:39.810]  Well, you're very welcome.
[10:39.810 --> 10:40.810]  Definitely very welcome.
[10:40.810 --> 10:45.810]  Your main question is the MED badge.
[10:45.810 --> 10:50.050]  Does it work like a Colorado red card or a medical marijuana recommendation?
[10:50.050 --> 10:52.650]  The red cards are now purple, which is a drastic change.
[10:52.650 --> 10:55.250]  Anyway, no, the main answer is no.
[10:55.250 --> 11:00.850]  The Colorado MED badge does not work the same as your Colorado medical marijuana recommendation.
[11:00.850 --> 11:05.170]  You cannot shop in a medical marijuana facility just because your badge.
[11:05.170 --> 11:07.050]  It does not work like that.
[11:07.050 --> 11:12.050]  Your badge will get you some discounts at other dispensaries if you shop at a dispensary.
[11:12.050 --> 11:15.250]  It also gets you into some of the smoke lounges for free.
[11:15.250 --> 11:19.010]  I know that if I wear my badge to the Canna Canyon, Camille does not charge me to get
[11:19.010 --> 11:20.010]  in.
[11:20.010 --> 11:21.010]  Camille has never charged me.
[11:21.010 --> 11:23.450]  No one's ever charged me to get into the Canna Canyon because I do advertising and
[11:23.450 --> 11:25.090]  I show love to the community.
[11:25.090 --> 11:29.450]  But if you have an MED badge, they will not charge you to get into the Canna Canyon is
[11:29.450 --> 11:32.050]  where most people would pay $5 at the door.
[11:32.050 --> 11:35.450]  There are some perks of having the badge, just some industry perks and friendly things
[11:35.450 --> 11:36.770]  that come.
[11:36.770 --> 11:41.090]  It does not work as a medical marijuana recommendation.
[11:41.090 --> 11:44.370]  To get a medical marijuana recommendation to get into a medical marijuana facility,
[11:44.370 --> 11:45.650]  you do need to see a doctor.
[11:45.650 --> 11:50.370]  There's no doctor involved in the MED paperwork and questionnaire.
[11:50.370 --> 11:52.370]  So I hope that answers your question.
[11:52.370 --> 11:56.290]  One thing I will mention, if you do have a Colorado medical marijuana card, you can use
[11:56.290 --> 12:00.010]  that card in Las Vegas in the state of Nevada.
[12:00.010 --> 12:04.310]  Nevada has medical marijuana and they do a reciprocal program where other states cards
[12:04.310 --> 12:05.310]  work there.
[12:05.310 --> 12:09.150]  So if you're a tourist and you are in Las Vegas or if you're in the state of Nevada,
[12:09.150 --> 12:12.590]  before you go to the bunny ranch, you can stop and grab yourself some ganja.
[12:12.590 --> 12:17.310]  So big up to Nevada for being a reciprocating state on the medical marijuana recommendation
[12:17.310 --> 12:18.310]  cards.
[12:18.310 --> 12:19.310]  That is super cool.
[12:19.310 --> 12:20.950]  So I hope that answered your question.
[12:20.950 --> 12:22.190]  I appreciate the email.
[12:22.190 --> 12:23.310]  Please send me more questions.
[12:23.310 --> 12:26.030]  I do appreciate the listener interaction.
[12:26.030 --> 12:28.990]  All right, I got another email.
[12:28.990 --> 12:34.250]  This is a Facebook message from a friend of ours and he asked me basically, what stops
[12:34.250 --> 12:39.210]  people or is it possible for somebody to buy a package of seeds and grow some plants
[12:39.210 --> 12:44.330]  out of it and then call those plants something else and then enter cannabis cups or other
[12:44.330 --> 12:48.410]  competitions with something that they claim is something they bred, but is actually something
[12:48.410 --> 12:53.050]  that they have purchased from a seed bank or they got a clone from somebody?
[12:53.050 --> 12:57.450]  The answer to that is nothing is stopping that other than our community and people's
[12:57.450 --> 12:58.450]  morals.
[12:58.450 --> 13:03.850]  But honestly, if I sold you seeds of any strain that I bred, you could take them home, you
[13:03.850 --> 13:07.330]  could grow them, you could find the keeper, you could wait three or four months until
[13:07.330 --> 13:08.970]  everybody forgot that you had that.
[13:08.970 --> 13:10.610]  And you could say, hey, look what I created.
[13:10.610 --> 13:12.530]  You could name it your whatever.
[13:12.530 --> 13:14.570]  I've got arrowhead water bottles in front of me.
[13:14.570 --> 13:18.010]  So I'm going to see, you could say you bred your arrowhead and you can call it this arrowhead
[13:18.010 --> 13:22.410]  and you could enter it into cannabis cups and you're going to fool a lot of people,
[13:22.410 --> 13:27.490]  but you won't fool the people that are really into the industry that know what strain is,
[13:27.490 --> 13:28.490]  what strain.
[13:28.490 --> 13:32.330]  There are guys when we go to cannabis cups, you can smoke a flower, somebody will pass
[13:32.330 --> 13:36.010]  you a joint and a lot of these guys will say, oh, is that Aaron's OG Kush that he grew
[13:36.010 --> 13:37.610]  over there at the clinic?
[13:37.610 --> 13:42.090]  And people know what these flowers taste like, look like, smell like, where catching on all
[13:42.090 --> 13:43.290]  the stuff that stands out.
[13:43.290 --> 13:48.290]  There are very few things that stand out enough to be cup winners.
[13:48.290 --> 13:50.170]  And so when we smoke these things, we notice them.
[13:50.170 --> 13:54.730]  We remember the flavor, remember the high, and then when we smoke it again, it's familiar.
[13:54.730 --> 13:58.890]  So if you try to pass it off as something else, somebody in the circle is going to notice.
[13:58.890 --> 14:02.570]  But honestly, 90% of the people in the world would be fooled.
[14:02.570 --> 14:03.570]  They will believe you.
[14:03.570 --> 14:07.930]  But the only thing stopping you from doing it is having some morals and not being a cannabis
[14:07.930 --> 14:08.930]  dick.
[14:08.930 --> 14:13.810]  I don't remember the year exactly, but I do remember that several years back, there was
[14:13.810 --> 14:17.010]  a person who bought a bunch of cannabis.
[14:17.010 --> 14:18.490]  I don't remember where he purchased the cannabis.
[14:18.490 --> 14:23.290]  I think he bought it from a coffee shop in Amsterdam or from a grower in Amsterdam, in
[14:23.290 --> 14:28.930]  Holland, and he entered it into the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, the original Cannabis Cup.
[14:28.930 --> 14:34.410]  And he walked around and persuaded people at the cup to vote for him as the best.
[14:34.410 --> 14:35.890]  They kind of bought votes from people.
[14:35.890 --> 14:39.930]  It wasn't a legitimately won Cannabis Cup, but these guys won a cup.
[14:39.930 --> 14:45.090]  They kind of stole a cup from DNA Genetics by buying another professional grower's flowers
[14:45.090 --> 14:49.450]  and putting their name on it and marketing it as their name to create their new seed
[14:49.450 --> 14:52.570]  company to make hype on their seed company.
[14:52.570 --> 14:55.850]  A lot of the people, most of the folks in Amsterdam knew what it was.
[14:55.850 --> 14:59.690]  The people that were voting for them were mostly tourists and people that were not really
[14:59.690 --> 15:01.690]  familiar with the weed game.
[15:01.690 --> 15:05.970]  So all the local Amsterdam had smoked it and they were like, hey, this is whatever's haze.
[15:05.970 --> 15:07.210]  They knew whose haze it was.
[15:07.210 --> 15:08.210]  They knew exactly.
[15:08.210 --> 15:12.290]  But these guys called it Ookie Kabookie and they fucking won a Cannabis Cup by stealing
[15:12.290 --> 15:16.050]  a strain, renaming it, and entering it into the cup.
[15:16.050 --> 15:19.330]  And then persuading other people to vote for it by kind of buying votes, by giving them
[15:19.330 --> 15:22.890]  weed, by talking to them, by kissing their asses.
[15:22.890 --> 15:26.210]  There's actually kind of a documentary on it if you want to Google it and look for it.
[15:26.210 --> 15:27.690]  Hold on, I'll go find the name for you.
[15:27.690 --> 15:30.730]  All right, you guys, I did a little bit of research.
[15:30.730 --> 15:32.650]  All I can find is some stuff on ICMag.
[15:32.650 --> 15:34.330]  Make sure you check out icmag.com.
[15:34.330 --> 15:35.570]  Join the forum.
[15:35.570 --> 15:40.250]  It says in 2007, Hager produced a reality TV show based around the High Times offices
[15:40.250 --> 15:41.970]  titled High Times Office.
[15:41.970 --> 15:46.170]  The show's 12th episode culminated in the 20th Cannabis Cup where Big Apple Seeds from
[15:46.170 --> 15:50.690]  Brooklyn, New York won a blind taste test against DNA seeds that was judged by Robert
[15:50.690 --> 15:51.810]  Connell Clark.
[15:51.810 --> 15:55.890]  It was later revealed in High Times that Doc and Dom, the owners of Big Apple Seeds, were
[15:55.890 --> 16:00.930]  actors and their entry, Ookie Kabookie, was actually Neville's Haze purchased in Amsterdam
[16:00.930 --> 16:05.530]  from a potbroker with a good nose for good weed.
[16:05.530 --> 16:10.690]  So that was posted up on ICMag from a poster, calls himself Saluki.
[16:10.690 --> 16:12.930]  He looks like he's well known on this place here.
[16:12.930 --> 16:14.370]  So shout out.
[16:14.370 --> 16:15.370]  Just read part of your post.
[16:15.370 --> 16:16.370]  I don't even know who I am.
[16:16.370 --> 16:18.410]  I don't know who you are, but you just got a shout out.
[16:18.410 --> 16:20.690]  So that is the legend of Ookie Kabookie and how that went.
[16:20.690 --> 16:22.610]  There were a lot of rumors on how that went down.
[16:22.610 --> 16:23.850]  That's just what I found on this one forum.
[16:23.850 --> 16:25.690]  It kind of brings back a lot of memories.
[16:25.690 --> 16:29.210]  So the original question was, can somebody steal a strain and rename it?
[16:29.210 --> 16:31.010]  Yes, they absolutely can.
[16:31.010 --> 16:33.010]  In this example, these people didn't even grow it.
[16:33.010 --> 16:36.330]  They bought it and then entered it into the Cannabis Cup and it was Neville's Haze, which
[16:36.330 --> 16:37.330]  is always going to win.
[16:37.330 --> 16:39.330]  That's one of the best strains on the planet when grown properly.
[16:39.330 --> 16:41.570]  You guys have to take a quick drink.
[16:41.570 --> 16:42.570]  I'm going to press pause.
[16:42.570 --> 16:43.570]  I'll be right back with you.
[16:44.570 --> 16:46.810]  All right, I am back.
[16:46.810 --> 16:50.570]  Before we get too far, I want to give a huge shout out to our friends at Nugs in Denver.
[16:50.570 --> 16:52.650]  Nugs 303, Denver's newest dispensary.
[16:52.650 --> 16:56.810]  Make sure you check them out at 3899 Quentin Street in Denver, Colorado.
[16:56.810 --> 17:00.690]  They're open Monday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
[17:00.690 --> 17:03.970]  They are currently only a medical cannabis facility.
[17:03.970 --> 17:07.690]  In the future, they will have a recreational side of the building.
[17:07.690 --> 17:13.250]  So we will be able to serve iRegenetics products to the entire recreational market.
[17:13.930 --> 17:14.930]  Stay tuned for that.
[17:14.930 --> 17:17.050]  So big shout out to our friends at Nugs in Denver.
[17:17.050 --> 17:18.690]  Make sure you follow their Instagram.
[17:18.690 --> 17:21.330]  It is Nugs.303.
[17:21.330 --> 17:22.730]  Shout out to the Grimy Gatsby.
[17:22.730 --> 17:25.050]  All right, let's get on with the show.
[17:25.050 --> 17:27.570]  I've got another email from a listener.
[17:27.570 --> 17:32.170]  This one is a question about seed pack labeling and flowering times.
[17:32.170 --> 17:37.450]  And when you're looking at seed packs online, you look at a package and it will say flowering
[17:37.450 --> 17:41.530]  time, usually 56 to 63 days is what most packages will say.
[17:41.530 --> 17:44.130]  Some will say 60 to 70 days.
[17:44.130 --> 17:46.090]  Hopefully they're writing the truth on there.
[17:46.090 --> 17:50.330]  But usually it's eight to nine weeks and they'll indicate that by the number of days.
[17:50.330 --> 17:55.450]  Now what that number is, is the flowering time, unless you've got auto flowering plants.
[17:55.450 --> 17:58.410]  If you've got auto flower plants, this does not apply.
[17:58.410 --> 18:04.130]  But if you've got regular photo period plants, this is what that number means.
[18:04.130 --> 18:09.050]  When a breeder labels his package of seeds and it says that this plant takes whatever
[18:09.050 --> 18:14.530]  eight to nine weeks or 56 to 63 days to finish, that is the flowering time.
[18:14.530 --> 18:19.610]  That's how long that plant is going to take to reach full maturity from the time you initiate
[18:19.610 --> 18:21.450]  the flowering period.
[18:21.450 --> 18:26.370]  And that is when from the very first day you turn that timer to 12-12.
[18:26.370 --> 18:33.110]  When the lights go from 12 hours on to 12 hours off, that is now day one of that phase.
[18:33.110 --> 18:37.450]  That nine week period that's written on the package has nothing to do with your veg cycle.
[18:37.450 --> 18:41.610]  You can veg those plants, you can sprout them as seedlings, you can get them like two
[18:41.610 --> 18:44.650]  inches tall and then you can flower them if you want to.
[18:44.650 --> 18:50.090]  So that could be 20 days or you can sprout them, you can veg them for 12 weeks and take
[18:50.090 --> 18:51.770]  a million clones and then flower.
[18:51.770 --> 18:53.370]  I don't know what you're going to do with the plants.
[18:53.370 --> 18:55.090]  The breeder doesn't know either.
[18:55.090 --> 18:56.930]  You're the only one that knows what you're going to do with that.
[18:56.930 --> 19:00.370]  So the veg time is as long as you want it to be.
[19:00.370 --> 19:05.050]  The flowering time is what is indicated on the package and it begins the day you turn
[19:05.050 --> 19:07.190]  those lights to 12-12.
[19:07.190 --> 19:11.930]  So if that breeder pack says that your plants are going to take 56 to 63 days, I usually
[19:11.930 --> 19:16.770]  recommend going the full 63 days unless it's completely obvious that that plant is going
[19:16.770 --> 19:17.770]  to be done earlier.
[19:17.770 --> 19:21.250]  Because of course, some phenotypes are going to finish sooner, some are going to finish
[19:21.250 --> 19:22.250]  a little bit later.
[19:22.250 --> 19:23.730]  I like to push them.
[19:23.730 --> 19:25.430]  I like to see what they're going to do.
[19:25.430 --> 19:28.850]  Sometimes a plant won't start putting on its bulk until the last couple of weeks.
[19:28.850 --> 19:30.810]  You might be cutting yourself out of some weight.
[19:30.810 --> 19:33.230]  You might be cutting yourself out of potency.
[19:33.230 --> 19:36.250]  Sometimes those plants will just throw on a whole nother layer of trichomes right at
[19:36.310 --> 19:37.310]  the end.
[19:37.310 --> 19:39.590]  You never know what you might be missing if you cut down too early.
[19:39.590 --> 19:43.630]  So if the package says that it could go nine weeks, let it go nine full weeks on the first
[19:43.630 --> 19:46.590]  run and then hopefully you've got clones.
[19:46.590 --> 19:49.430]  So now you get to pick your favorite phenotype out of that seed pack.
[19:49.430 --> 19:53.790]  You get to run it again and then you get to dial in exactly how many days to flower that
[19:53.790 --> 19:55.350]  plant for.
[19:55.350 --> 19:57.630]  Sometimes your first run with the plant is just an experiment.
[19:57.630 --> 19:59.550]  You got to see what it's going to do.
[19:59.550 --> 20:01.030]  So that's my take on that.
[20:01.030 --> 20:04.430]  The time indicated on the pack is how long the plant will flower.
[20:04.430 --> 20:07.170]  So keep that in mind when you're purchasing your seeds.
[20:07.170 --> 20:12.610]  If you're looking for a reputable seed vendor in the United States, I would recommend thedankteam.com.
[20:12.610 --> 20:15.690]  The D-A-N-K-T-E-A-M.com.
[20:15.690 --> 20:16.690]  Thedankteam.com.
[20:16.690 --> 20:19.170]  Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[20:19.170 --> 20:23.810]  They've got things from Gage Green Genetics, Sour Seeds, Mile High, Canaventure.
[20:23.810 --> 20:25.690]  They got a lot of great stuff on there.
[20:25.690 --> 20:28.010]  They may even have some Irie Genetics.
[20:28.010 --> 20:29.850]  I'm not sure what's available.
[20:29.850 --> 20:32.210]  You'll have to go and take a look for yourself.
[20:32.990 --> 20:36.670]  Let's move on to another question.
[20:36.670 --> 20:38.750]  This question actually came from a friend of mine.
[20:38.750 --> 20:39.750]  Shout out to Los.
[20:39.750 --> 20:41.790]  I hope you're listening to this.
[20:41.790 --> 20:46.230]  There is a cultivar, there's a clone, there's a varietal, there's a stream, there's a plant
[20:46.230 --> 20:52.030]  that goes around our region that is a sour diesel clone.
[20:52.030 --> 20:57.470]  When it is grown properly, you cannot keep it in a baggie, in a jar.
[20:57.470 --> 21:00.470]  You can't put it in a baggie inside of a jar.
[21:00.470 --> 21:02.810]  You can't hide this weed from anybody.
[21:02.810 --> 21:07.890]  If you put it in a baggie, in a jar, and in your car, you can smell this sour diesel outside
[21:07.890 --> 21:08.890]  of the car.
[21:08.890 --> 21:10.370]  This shit is potent.
[21:10.370 --> 21:12.950]  This is some super loud weed.
[21:12.950 --> 21:14.570]  This shit is crazy.
[21:14.570 --> 21:18.370]  But when I give it to a lot of my friends, they cannot grow it.
[21:18.370 --> 21:21.490]  I myself cannot grow this stream worth a shit.
[21:21.490 --> 21:25.330]  I know three or four people that grow this stream fucking amazingly.
[21:25.330 --> 21:26.330]  It comes out beautifully.
[21:26.330 --> 21:27.570]  The calyxes swell up.
[21:27.570 --> 21:28.570]  It's covered in resin.
[21:28.670 --> 21:31.710]  It's that gassy fuel funk smell to it.
[21:31.710 --> 21:37.070]  So me being the inquisitive guy that I am, I know a few guys that grow it.
[21:37.070 --> 21:40.750]  So I asked them, I was like, hey, how do you grow that sour diesel?
[21:40.750 --> 21:45.950]  And all three of the people that grow it successfully have told me that it grows in some type of
[21:45.950 --> 21:48.130]  a hydroponic system.
[21:48.130 --> 21:53.430]  So what that leads me to think, these guys, myself included, that are trying to grow this
[21:53.430 --> 22:00.850]  cultivar, this clone, this varietal, this plant, this strain in a soil or soilless mix,
[22:00.850 --> 22:05.250]  we're not going to have much success because this plant was probably phenohunted from a
[22:05.250 --> 22:09.090]  pack of seeds by somebody that grows in hydro.
[22:09.090 --> 22:12.530]  This plant was selected for a hydroponic system.
[22:12.530 --> 22:16.130]  I don't think anybody growing it, and this could be wrong, but I don't think most of
[22:16.130 --> 22:21.450]  the people growing it in soil are ever going to bring out that flavor and aroma that my
[22:21.470 --> 22:26.950]  friends in the hydroponic system are getting because I feel like some plants like hydro
[22:26.950 --> 22:28.550]  and some plants like soil.
[22:28.550 --> 22:33.950]  And this is a perfect example of phenotypical expression.
[22:33.950 --> 22:36.750]  The grower that found this plant probably grows hydro.
[22:36.750 --> 22:39.350]  So he thought, look at this amazing plant that I've got.
[22:39.350 --> 22:42.790]  And then he gave it to all of us soil growers and we're just frustrated.
[22:42.790 --> 22:44.110]  We're so angry.
[22:44.110 --> 22:45.830]  So that is my opinion.
[22:45.830 --> 22:50.270]  I think that some strains, and I keep saying all these different words, and they're known
[22:50.290 --> 22:51.850]  as different things in different circles.
[22:51.850 --> 22:54.770]  People will call them varietals and you'll hear a cultivar also.
[22:54.770 --> 22:56.810]  I'll say strains or clones.
[22:56.810 --> 23:01.250]  Some strains or clones or plants are just not simply going to work.
[23:01.250 --> 23:06.050]  And I'm sure that if you took one of my soil plants and you tried to grow that in a hydroponic
[23:06.050 --> 23:10.530]  system, you may not have as stellar results as you would have in soil.
[23:10.530 --> 23:12.370]  It's just some plants are going to like some things.
[23:12.370 --> 23:13.370]  So that's my opinion.
[23:13.370 --> 23:15.250]  That's what I think is going on with that plant.
[23:15.250 --> 23:17.250]  So shout out to Los for asking me that.
[23:17.250 --> 23:20.070]  I kind of told him the same thing and he scratched his head and looked at me like I
[23:20.070 --> 23:21.070]  was a genius.
[23:21.070 --> 23:23.390]  I thought I would share that with you guys.
[23:23.390 --> 23:24.390]  All right.
[23:24.390 --> 23:26.950]  I feel like that's enough emails for this episode.
[23:26.950 --> 23:29.790]  I've got a couple more emails that I will read on a future episode.
[23:29.790 --> 23:34.190]  I feel like if I get into one of them today, it will be way too long of a show.
[23:34.190 --> 23:38.070]  Oh wait, there is one email I can definitely reply to right now.
[23:38.070 --> 23:41.030]  Somebody sent me an email asking about cannabis and sex.
[23:41.030 --> 23:44.390]  They said, can you talk about cannabis and sex?
[23:44.410 --> 23:48.110]  Where is my take on cannabis and sex?
[23:48.110 --> 23:49.110]  Do that shit.
[23:49.110 --> 23:50.110]  All right.
[23:50.110 --> 23:53.950]  Somebody else also sent me an email about cannabis and pregnancy.
[23:53.950 --> 23:58.230]  They wanted to know about the pros and cons and the advantages and disadvantages of cannabis
[23:58.230 --> 23:59.510]  used during pregnancy.
[23:59.510 --> 24:02.470]  Honestly, I am not well educated in that subject.
[24:02.470 --> 24:06.470]  So I am going to do some research and I will try to get you an episode that features a
[24:06.470 --> 24:08.950]  little bit about cannabis and pregnancy.
[24:08.950 --> 24:10.510]  I'll get that out to you in the future.
[24:11.510 --> 24:14.750]  I'm trying to do it soon because it sounds like somebody might be pregnant right now.
[24:14.750 --> 24:15.750]  Congratulations.
[24:15.750 --> 24:16.750]  I hope that goes well.
[24:16.750 --> 24:17.750]  I hope mama is happy.
[24:17.750 --> 24:20.110]  Hope the baby's healthy and I hope daddy is doing well.
[24:20.110 --> 24:21.110]  All right.
[24:21.110 --> 24:22.270]  That pretty much wraps up this episode.
[24:22.270 --> 24:25.190]  You guys, if you see me at the secret sesh, please introduce yourself.
[24:25.190 --> 24:26.190]  Shake my hand.
[24:26.190 --> 24:27.190]  Say hello.

[24:28.190 --> 24:29.190]  I'd love to meet you.
[24:29.190 --> 24:30.390]  Tell me what you think of the podcast.
[24:30.390 --> 24:34.330]  I may have a microphone and a recording device with me, so we may be able to do some recording
[24:34.330 --> 24:35.510]  if you're interested.
[24:35.510 --> 24:36.510]  I would love to meet you.
[24:36.510 --> 24:38.190]  I hope everybody has a great 420.
[24:38.750 --> 24:40.790]  I hope you've had a great 420 weekend so far.

[27:45.120 --> 27:48.120]  Bring the fire inna ground, Jah Jah send me fi purge
[27:48.120 --> 28:02.920]  But I can't do it alone, by truth

[29:06.490 --> 29:15.240]  Here comes trouble, here comes the danger
[30:12.650 --> 30:14.650]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff
[30:14.650 --> 30:16.650]  I want to thank you once again for joining me
[30:16.650 --> 30:18.650]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shoutout
[30:18.650 --> 30:20.650]  To my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[30:20.650 --> 30:22.650]  For letting me use their music on my podcast
[30:22.650 --> 30:26.650]  Big shoutout to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew
[30:28.650 --> 30:31.650]  I hope everybody had a safe 420, I hope everybody got super red-eyed
[30:31.650 --> 30:36.650]  I was checking out my stash, I think I smoked about 14 grams of hash
[30:36.650 --> 30:41.650]  And ate about 2500 milligrams of edibles over the 420 celebration
[30:42.650 --> 30:45.650]  My eyes were a little bit red, I ate 1000 milligrams on 420
[30:45.650 --> 30:49.650]  And I woke up on 421 having to peel my eyes open, I was a little crispy
[30:49.650 --> 30:51.650]  I hope you guys got super high
[30:51.650 --> 30:54.650]  Hey guys, this is a great episode, I am joined by my good buddy Kabuki J. Fox
[30:54.650 --> 30:56.650]  And we talk a little bit about CBD
[30:56.650 --> 30:59.650]  Also White Mike was on the show, but he had to run halfway through the show
[30:59.650 --> 31:02.650]  This is a really long podcast, I'm not going to ramble on too long
[31:02.650 --> 31:04.650]  So I'm going to let the music play for a second
[31:04.650 --> 31:09.650]  And when we get back, we will be joined by White Mike and Kabuki J. Fox
[31:09.650 --> 31:11.650]  So take a fat dab, sit tight, we'll be right back
[31:17.610 --> 31:18.610]  I'm fucking terrible at rolling
[31:18.610 --> 31:20.610]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are back
[31:20.610 --> 31:22.610]  I'm sitting at the table with our good buddy White Mike, how you doing bro?
[31:22.610 --> 31:23.610]  Doing well man, how are you?
[31:23.610 --> 31:27.610]  I am great, also sitting across from me, welcome to my house bro
[31:27.610 --> 31:32.610]  Sitting across from me at the table is Kabuki J. Fox from RunCBD slash Foxtracks
[31:32.610 --> 31:33.610]  Welcome to the humble abode bro
[31:33.610 --> 31:35.610]  Thank you, nice to finally be here neighbor
[31:35.610 --> 31:38.610]  Oh it's great to have you here man, welcome to Pueblo, you live in Pueblo now
[31:38.610 --> 31:39.610]  How does that feel?
[31:39.610 --> 31:40.610]  I do, I love it here man, great place
[31:40.610 --> 31:42.610]  Welcome, it's good to have you here
[31:42.610 --> 31:45.610]  It's great to have both of you guys here on the podcast at the same time, this is going to be a great show
[31:45.610 --> 31:47.610]  Yeah, nice to meet you White Mike
[31:47.610 --> 31:48.610]  Yeah, thanks man
[31:48.610 --> 31:49.610]  He calls you White Mike, I fucking love it
[31:49.610 --> 31:51.610]  He's never going to be White Mike forever
[31:51.610 --> 31:54.610]  I could tell, like who knows me strictly from the podcast
[31:54.610 --> 31:57.610]  Because that's where that name exists for the most part
[31:57.610 --> 31:59.610]  Yeah, he just came out as White Mike on the show one day
[31:59.610 --> 32:00.610]  Oh really?
[32:00.610 --> 32:01.610]  Yeah, that's my buddy White Mike
[32:01.610 --> 32:02.610]  White Mike for life for you bro
[32:02.610 --> 32:04.610]  White Mike for, hashtag White Mike for life
[32:05.610 --> 32:07.610]  I'm getting some echo, what's that echo from?
[32:07.610 --> 32:08.610]  Alright, I got it under control, sorry
[32:08.610 --> 32:11.610]  You guys are not sound guys, I don't know why I asked anybody else what the echo was from
[32:11.610 --> 32:12.610]  Jeff is an amazing sound guy
[32:12.610 --> 32:14.610]  Bum bum bum, it's because we turned up the bass on Mike
[32:14.610 --> 32:16.610]  Because Mike's got a head cold, hope you get well bro
[32:16.610 --> 32:17.610]  But you didn't notice
[32:17.610 --> 32:18.610]  Working on it
[32:19.610 --> 32:20.610]  Fancy didn't say you didn't hear
[32:20.610 --> 32:24.610]  So Kabuki's over here rolling a blunt and Mike was quite impressed by your rolling skills
[32:24.610 --> 32:25.610]  Yep, way better than I am
[32:25.610 --> 32:30.610]  Yeah, I got a bunch of dry sip frozen on my fingers, I'm like tearing the leaves apart, usually I'll do a better job
[32:30.610 --> 32:37.610]  Alright, so welcome to the show you guys, this is the episode after 420, we're going to do a little bit of a 420 recap
[32:37.610 --> 32:39.610]  We'll talk about where everybody was, what they all did on 420
[32:39.610 --> 32:43.610]  And we're going to talk about some bullshit that happened on 420
[32:43.610 --> 32:44.610]  Ah yeah, there's a lot of that
[32:44.610 --> 32:46.610]  Yeah, Mike what did you do on 420 my friend?
[32:46.610 --> 32:52.610]  Um, I had a really low key 420, I had the day off but I also didn't have childcare that day
[32:52.610 --> 32:54.610]  So I hung out with the kid until about 6
[32:54.610 --> 32:59.610]  Um, I ran around town and picked up a whole bunch of marijuana products that don't get you high
[32:59.610 --> 33:01.610]  And ran those up to a friend in Denver
[33:01.610 --> 33:04.610]  Shout out to your friend in Denver, I hope we are able to take good care of him
[33:04.610 --> 33:05.610]  Working on it
[33:05.610 --> 33:08.610]  Yes, shout out to CBD, hashtag fuck cancer
[33:08.610 --> 33:09.610]  Always
[33:09.610 --> 33:16.610]  So your CBD, your 420 was spent, you guys, you may have to excuse us, there will be some stutters and some stumbles
[33:16.610 --> 33:19.610]  And some randomness in this podcast, I promise you
[33:19.610 --> 33:21.610]  Many giant dabs have been taken
[33:21.610 --> 33:24.610]  Many giant dabs have happened, there are two emails
[33:24.610 --> 33:25.610]  A relatively small amount of time
[33:25.610 --> 33:28.610]  Yes, a short amount of time, lots of dabs, there are two emails on the table
[33:28.610 --> 33:31.610]  We've got a beautiful rig from our friends at Bear Mountain Studios
[33:31.610 --> 33:33.610]  Shout out to Evan and Cass
[33:33.610 --> 33:37.610]  Shout out to those kids, great kids, I met them at the Cannabis Cup a couple years ago
[33:37.610 --> 33:38.610]  Great kids
[33:38.610 --> 33:42.610]  So Mike hung out with the kid on 420, I was going to ask Kabuki what he did
[33:42.610 --> 33:45.610]  But he has taken a glob over here of some rosin
[33:45.610 --> 33:46.610]  So we're going to have to give him a minute
[33:46.610 --> 33:49.610]  That was like a week's worth of Mike dabs right there
[33:49.610 --> 33:50.610]  That was a fact, there we go
[33:50.610 --> 33:52.610]  We're going to change that tonight
[33:54.610 --> 33:55.610]  There we go
[33:55.610 --> 33:58.610]  We're going to clear this household up and give a variety of dabs
[33:58.610 --> 34:01.610]  We've seen what happens when we give Mike too big of a dab
[34:01.610 --> 34:04.610]  He turns different colors, has to run to the bathroom and hide for a minute
[34:04.610 --> 34:05.610]  Yeah, it's nice in there
[34:05.610 --> 34:07.610]  Feel free, I will grab one, thank you bro
[34:07.610 --> 34:09.610]  So my friend Kabuki, what did you do on 420 bro?
[34:09.610 --> 34:12.610]  My 420 was pretty low key-ish
[34:12.610 --> 34:17.610]  You know, my girl's mom was in town so we just kind of kicked it
[34:17.610 --> 34:20.610]  Is your girl's mom a smoker?
[34:20.610 --> 34:22.610]  Yeah, she's totally pro-cannabis
[34:22.610 --> 34:25.610]  She's super awesome, her name's Pam
[34:25.610 --> 34:27.610]  Shout out to moms, she's great
[34:27.610 --> 34:30.610]  Yeah, definitely, shout out to moms that support cannabis even if they don't do
[34:31.610 --> 34:35.610]  Yeah, and then I sponsored the 5280 Glass Showcase
[34:35.610 --> 34:36.610]  Which was really cool
[34:36.610 --> 34:41.610]  From what I heard, it went on pretty long from like 4 to midnight
[34:41.610 --> 34:44.610]  And I caught it towards the end of it, I showed up at 8
[34:44.610 --> 34:46.610]  Where was that happening?
[34:46.610 --> 34:49.610]  At Native Hotel in downtown Denver
[34:49.610 --> 34:50.610]  N-A-T-I-V
[34:50.610 --> 34:52.610]  Yes, and it was cool how they handled that
[34:52.610 --> 34:58.610]  Because they had two buses outside where any dabbing or smoking or any consumption was done
[34:58.610 --> 35:02.610]  So, though obviously we couldn't do anything in the hotel
[35:02.610 --> 35:05.610]  They had made space and a counter for people that were getting medicated
[35:05.610 --> 35:07.610]  And they weren't fucked with at all all night
[35:07.610 --> 35:10.610]  I want to give a shout out to Adam Dunn and his crew
[35:10.610 --> 35:14.610]  They were the first people I ever saw use rented buses
[35:14.610 --> 35:18.610]  They had tour buses for bands and we parked them outside of the Fox or the Oriental Theater one night
[35:18.610 --> 35:22.610]  And they're like, you can't medicate in here but this is a VIP bus, wink wink
[35:22.610 --> 35:25.610]  And we were able to dab in there because it's private property
[35:25.610 --> 35:26.610]  Exactly, so that's pretty rad
[35:26.610 --> 35:27.610]  That's how that worked out
[35:27.610 --> 35:31.610]  And yeah, it was a cool event, just approaching a local glass artist
[35:31.610 --> 35:34.610]  A lot of people showed up, a lot of friendly faces
[35:34.610 --> 35:38.610]  It was super fun, after that I went to see some good friends of mine downtown
[35:38.610 --> 35:42.610]  One ate some pizza, some mac and cheese pizza from...
[35:42.610 --> 35:44.610]  Fuck, I can't remember the name of this place
[35:44.610 --> 35:45.610]  Mac and cheese pizza
[35:45.610 --> 35:46.610]  It was awesome
[35:46.610 --> 35:47.610]  That sounds familiar
[35:47.610 --> 35:50.610]  Fucking like, you know, because it's white cheese sauce from the Mac
[35:50.610 --> 35:52.610]  And New York style bread on the...
[35:52.610 --> 35:54.610]  Ugh, it was awesome
[35:55.610 --> 35:57.610]  Why did you do that at the start of the show?
[35:57.610 --> 35:59.610]  Dude, I wonder how much pizza was sold in 420
[35:59.610 --> 36:00.610]  That's so bad right now
[36:00.610 --> 36:03.610]  Oh shit, I don't know, I mean, I don't know
[36:03.610 --> 36:06.610]  Maybe, I want to say a million dollars worth of pizza, at least, easy
[36:06.610 --> 36:10.610]  I don't know how much pizza is sold in Denver on a daily basis, but...
[36:10.610 --> 36:13.610]  I actually know a guy that works at a pizza place
[36:13.610 --> 36:17.610]  Who said that the owner of his pizza place almost had to close the business
[36:17.610 --> 36:19.610]  Because they weren't surviving here in Pueblo
[36:19.610 --> 36:20.610]  What?
[36:20.610 --> 36:21.610]  And then cannabis was legalized
[36:22.610 --> 36:25.610]  And now their business is thriving and they're opening more locations
[36:25.610 --> 36:27.610]  So, shout out to cannabis and pizza
[36:27.610 --> 36:30.610]  Shout out to Pueblo for smoking more weed
[36:30.610 --> 36:31.610]  Yeah, more weed than...
[36:31.610 --> 36:33.610]  So, you've been all over the place, Fox
[36:33.610 --> 36:35.610]  We do have stuff to talk about on this podcast
[36:35.610 --> 36:37.610]  But we're going to get ADD today and it's going to be a lot of fun
[36:37.610 --> 36:40.610]  I think a lot of good shit comes out of these random conversations
[36:40.610 --> 36:41.610]  You've been all over the place
[36:41.610 --> 36:44.610]  Where do you find smokes the most herb?
[36:44.610 --> 36:47.610]  Are we talking Colorado only or are we talking in general?
[36:47.610 --> 36:48.610]  Anywhere you've been, yeah
[36:49.610 --> 36:51.610]  Okay, so I'll say this
[36:51.610 --> 36:55.610]  California is interesting because I was in the Bay and Northern Cali
[36:55.610 --> 36:58.610]  And it's very cannabis friendly up there as far as the cities go
[36:58.610 --> 37:01.610]  Lifestyle, culture, it's very cannabis integrated
[37:03.610 --> 37:09.610]  But as of lately, Colorado within the last year I feel has really stepped their shit up
[37:11.610 --> 37:15.610]  So, yeah, and I want to say...
[37:16.610 --> 37:21.610]  There's so many fucking people that blow it down heavy down here
[37:21.610 --> 37:25.610]  Yeah, between Denver and Pueblo, there's a lot of heavy heads
[37:25.610 --> 37:27.610]  And let me reiterate that
[37:27.610 --> 37:31.610]  From the mountains up north to Pueblo, there's a lot of really heavy heads
[37:31.610 --> 37:35.610]  So, I still think that people in Colorado really throw it down, you know
[37:35.610 --> 37:39.610]  And it's time for the city and our culture to catch up with it, you know
[37:39.610 --> 37:41.610]  Right, yeah, so shout out to Colorado
[37:41.610 --> 37:43.610]  Apparently, we smoke a lot of herb
[37:43.610 --> 37:45.610]  Yeah, you guys do, you know
[37:45.610 --> 37:49.610]  I mean, hey, from Miami to California to New York to Oregon to Washington
[37:49.610 --> 37:52.610]  I mean, all these places are different and stuff
[37:52.610 --> 37:55.610]  But Colorado is still the bedrock, you know
[37:55.610 --> 37:59.610]  People always look to us regardless of whether we want to admit it or not
[37:59.610 --> 38:03.610]  So, it's just about, you know, you can accept that it's not about wearing a badge or anything
[38:03.610 --> 38:05.610]  But, you know, it's the truth, you know
[38:05.610 --> 38:07.610]  So, embrace it, smoke it up
[38:07.610 --> 38:08.610]  There you go
[38:08.610 --> 38:10.610]  Alright, so, did you have a good 420, bro?
[38:10.610 --> 38:12.610]  Yes, it was super nice
[38:12.610 --> 38:17.610]  It was super nice, minus the drive from Pueblo to Denver to Pueblo on the same night
[38:17.610 --> 38:19.610]  Yeah, those are... I did the same thing on 420
[38:19.610 --> 38:23.610]  It was not... It wasn't a bad drive that night, but there was a lot of enforcement
[38:23.610 --> 38:28.610]  Absolutely, which luckily, I didn't hear about any of our friends or anyone, you know
[38:28.610 --> 38:32.610]  In close relation of our circles being fucked with in that sense, but...
[38:32.610 --> 38:37.610]  I know a couple of folks who got pulled over, but they didn't get cited for anything
[38:37.610 --> 38:39.610]  They just got pulled over and sent on their way
[38:39.610 --> 38:41.610]  Yeah, well, that's nice, you know
[38:41.610 --> 38:42.610]  Yep
[38:42.610 --> 38:44.610]  At least no one got fucked with
[38:44.610 --> 38:46.610]  Right, sorry, I was taking a hit off this blunt
[38:46.610 --> 38:47.610]  Sorry for the stink
[38:47.610 --> 38:50.610]  It looks delicious and I'd love to hit it, but not with the cold, you guys
[38:50.610 --> 38:53.610]  What was your favorite piece of glass you saw at this glass showcase, bro?
[38:53.610 --> 38:57.610]  Ooh, okay, so... Shit, put me on the spot
[38:57.610 --> 39:06.610]  So, Calm, at Combo on Instagram, Calvin, does the birds and stuff like that
[39:06.610 --> 39:09.610]  Yeah, that's one of Weezy's favorite glass artists also
[39:09.610 --> 39:14.610]  He's my favorite sculpture artist, always has been, I love his birds, they're fucking awesome
[39:14.610 --> 39:18.610]  But him and Alex Tuba, who does those warlock pendies, they just went to Japan
[39:18.610 --> 39:24.610]  And the fucking collabs that they did with Team Japan, the Aquarius, the dudes that do all the dot work and all that
[39:24.610 --> 39:28.610]  It just blew my mind, like literally, like...
[39:29.610 --> 39:34.610]  There was one bird with like a Mandela dot work on the stomach and it was just like...
[39:34.610 --> 39:37.610]  The detail is insane, you could have gotten lost in it, you know
[39:37.610 --> 39:41.610]  It's one of those pieces that I probably wouldn't even use, I mean I would, but you know
[39:41.610 --> 39:43.610]  Do you know what the price tag was on that piece?
[39:43.610 --> 39:49.610]  15k on it, yeah, it was definitely... Yeah, I mean you talk Team Japan and anything Calm
[39:49.610 --> 39:53.610]  You know, it's gonna be pricey, but holy shit
[39:53.610 --> 39:55.610]  Beautiful artwork
[39:55.610 --> 39:58.610]  Oh, absolutely, and there was a lot of other great artists there too
[39:59.610 --> 40:04.610]  Oh, shit, John Taylor made like this with...
[40:05.610 --> 40:07.610]  Shit
[40:07.610 --> 40:08.610]  That guy's coming up quick
[40:08.610 --> 40:10.610]  Yeah, he made the AK replicas
[40:10.610 --> 40:11.610]  Oh, okay, wow
[40:11.610 --> 40:17.610]  So yeah, like very... I know he's kind of a... you know, he's very adamant about gun stuff and stuff
[40:17.610 --> 40:21.610]  And you can see it in his glass work, because the detail to the piece is incredible
[40:21.610 --> 40:22.610]  Nice
[40:22.610 --> 40:26.610]  He did it with Pogo Glass, who... he's a great friend too
[40:26.610 --> 40:28.610]  And that guy kills it in his own regard
[40:28.610 --> 40:33.610]  There was, yeah, Lunchbox Mechanic, Matt Pinner, he was there doing his thing
[40:34.610 --> 40:36.610]  Yeah, there was a lot of shit there
[40:36.610 --> 40:39.610]  I got there pretty late, and it was mostly about just seeing people
[40:39.610 --> 40:45.610]  You know, because I hadn't gone into Denver almost, you know, two, three months on any event like that
[40:45.610 --> 40:48.610]  So it was nice just catching up with all friendly faces from up north
[40:48.610 --> 40:50.610]  Yeah, that's the fun part of these events
[40:50.610 --> 40:51.610]  Oh, of course, absolutely
[40:51.610 --> 40:54.610]  And the art was just, you know, a bonus
[40:54.610 --> 40:56.610]  It was weird not having a cannabis cup
[40:56.610 --> 40:58.610]  Usually the cup is where I see everybody
[40:58.610 --> 41:01.610]  I want to say as much shit as people talk about the cup or whatever they...
[41:01.610 --> 41:05.610]  You know, whatever gripes they have against, you know, the competition side of it or whatever it is
[41:05.610 --> 41:10.610]  You can definitely feel the missed presence of that event
[41:10.610 --> 41:11.610]  Absolutely
[41:11.610 --> 41:14.610]  It made... people had their opinions about it, and whatever you thought of it
[41:14.610 --> 41:17.610]  It was just a great place to meet up with everybody
[41:17.610 --> 41:23.610]  I would see everybody from Addison DeMora to Kabuki J. Fox to just my random local friends there
[41:23.610 --> 41:25.610]  And we would all get along and hang out
[41:25.610 --> 41:26.610]  I would dab with Danny Danko
[41:27.610 --> 41:28.610]  Everybody, we'd just hang out
[41:28.610 --> 41:29.610]  It would be such a good time
[41:29.610 --> 41:32.610]  And there's nowhere else you can go and see that many people
[41:32.610 --> 41:34.610]  No, not at the same place
[41:34.610 --> 41:39.610]  And though it's cool because now we, you know, I unfortunately missed Secret Sessions this year
[41:39.610 --> 41:42.610]  So I'm glad that I've been told that they're going to be planning it for the next one
[41:42.610 --> 41:43.610]  Because we'll be out there hard
[41:43.610 --> 41:47.610]  But a lot of, you know, a lot of events were planned
[41:47.610 --> 41:50.610]  And I feel like of the fucking...
[41:50.610 --> 41:54.610]  Of the seven... the five to seven events that I heard of
[41:54.610 --> 41:57.610]  Three to four of them, all but two
[41:57.610 --> 41:59.610]  And the showcase got raided
[41:59.610 --> 42:03.610]  Yes, the cops did shut down almost all consumption events
[42:03.610 --> 42:05.610]  Yeah, the law enforcement was not amused
[42:05.610 --> 42:09.610]  My laughter was because I tried to pick up a water bottle off of an oil slick pad
[42:09.610 --> 42:13.610]  And there was so much oil on the oil slick pad that the water bottle just stuck to it
[42:13.610 --> 42:15.610]  And it was pretty damn funny if you heard my goofy laughter
[42:15.610 --> 42:16.610]  Oh, that's what that was
[42:16.610 --> 42:17.610]  That was what that was all about
[42:17.610 --> 42:18.610]  I thought you were doing a magic trick
[42:18.610 --> 42:21.610]  Yeah, well, I accidentally am a magician now
[42:21.610 --> 42:23.610]  So you mentioned Secret Sessions
[42:23.610 --> 42:26.610]  That's obviously where I was for 421
[42:26.610 --> 42:29.610]  I'm laughing at you guys complaining about your driving
[42:29.610 --> 42:30.610]  I work in Colorado Springs
[42:30.610 --> 42:33.610]  For 420, I woke up, I live in Pueblo
[42:33.610 --> 42:35.610]  I woke up, got stoned as shit
[42:35.610 --> 42:37.610]  Drove up to Colorado Springs to work
[42:37.610 --> 42:39.610]  Worked in Colorado Springs
[42:39.610 --> 42:41.610]  The boss called me at 220
[42:41.610 --> 42:43.610]  Or called me at 2 o'clock and he said, be ready for 220 dabs
[42:43.610 --> 42:44.610]  I'm going to pick you up
[42:44.610 --> 42:46.610]  So we went to lunch
[42:46.610 --> 42:48.610]  We came back
[42:48.610 --> 42:49.610]  I went to work for a little bit
[42:49.610 --> 42:51.610]  My alarm went off, said hey, it's 4 o'clock
[42:51.610 --> 42:52.610]  I went and took another break
[42:52.610 --> 42:55.610]  Celebrated 420, took about a half gram dab
[42:55.610 --> 42:57.610]  Went back to work, came home
[42:57.610 --> 42:58.610]  The next day I went to Secret Sesh
[42:58.610 --> 43:01.610]  So I went, Pueblo, Springs, Pueblo
[43:01.610 --> 43:03.610]  Woke up, drove to Pueblo
[43:03.610 --> 43:05.610]  Or drove to Springs on 421
[43:05.610 --> 43:07.610]  Handled the garden, the stuff that needed to be done
[43:07.610 --> 43:09.610]  Drove to Secret Sesh in Denver
[43:09.610 --> 43:12.610]  Rage Secret Sesh from about 4 in the afternoon
[43:12.610 --> 43:13.610]  Until about 1 in the morning
[43:13.610 --> 43:15.610]  Dabbing with all kinds of people
[43:15.610 --> 43:18.610]  I smoked, I took 11 grams with me
[43:18.610 --> 43:21.610]  And I think I smoked 7 of them at the Secret Sesh
[43:22.610 --> 43:24.610]  Plus whatever other people were dabbing me on with
[43:24.610 --> 43:26.610]  Shout out, if you gave me a dab at Secret Sesh
[43:26.610 --> 43:27.610]  Shout out, thank you
[43:27.610 --> 43:29.610]  It looked like a lot of fun, a lot of friends were there
[43:29.610 --> 43:30.610]  It was a huge good time
[43:30.610 --> 43:32.610]  I've got a huge list of people I want to give shout outs to from that
[43:32.610 --> 43:34.610]  But I wanted to talk about a couple of other things first
[43:34.610 --> 43:35.610]  I don't remember what I was saying
[43:35.610 --> 43:39.610]  But I drove back from the Secret Sesh to work
[43:39.610 --> 43:40.610]  To check on the plants again
[43:40.610 --> 43:43.610]  Because I didn't get everything done in the first half of the day
[43:43.610 --> 43:45.610]  And I knew the plants weren't ready for more water
[43:45.610 --> 43:46.610]  So I gave them some time to chill
[43:46.610 --> 43:48.610]  And went back and took care of them again later
[43:48.610 --> 43:50.610]  So I showed up to the garden at like 3 in the morning
[43:50.610 --> 43:51.610]  Took care of the plants
[43:51.610 --> 43:54.610]  Hey, shout outs to you getting your shit done
[43:54.610 --> 43:56.610]  Regardless of our holiday
[43:56.610 --> 43:59.610]  Which regardless of, you know, it's great for the patients
[43:59.610 --> 44:03.610]  But when you're in the industry or you have work to tend to
[44:03.610 --> 44:05.610]  You have to balance the both, you know
[44:05.610 --> 44:06.610]  I appreciate that
[44:06.610 --> 44:08.610]  And I'm going to extend that shout out beyond myself
[44:08.610 --> 44:11.610]  To everybody, all the Canada Soldiers that have a garden
[44:11.610 --> 44:13.610]  You can see who it is
[44:13.610 --> 44:14.610]  We'll be having a good ass time
[44:14.610 --> 44:16.610]  And 6 or 8 people will look at their watches
[44:16.610 --> 44:17.610]  And you see them go, oh shit
[44:17.610 --> 44:18.610]  Gotta go
[44:18.610 --> 44:19.610]  Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go
[44:19.610 --> 44:20.610]  We all have something at the garden
[44:20.610 --> 44:22.610]  We all just take off, go to our separate grows
[44:22.610 --> 44:24.610]  That blunt is sticky, bro
[44:24.610 --> 44:25.610]  Nice work
[44:25.610 --> 44:27.610]  Thank you, yeah, there's a bunch of bras inside too
[44:27.610 --> 44:29.610]  So that's the whole reason for the sticky
[44:29.610 --> 44:31.610]  So I of course went to the secret sesh
[44:31.610 --> 44:33.610]  Shout out to everybody at the secret sesh
[44:33.610 --> 44:35.610]  I've got a long list of people here that I want to give shout outs to
[44:35.610 --> 44:37.610]  Of course I want to give a huge shout out to my boy
[44:37.610 --> 44:40.610]  Jon Hunt, the grimy motherfucking Gatsby
[44:40.610 --> 44:41.610]  Hashtag I know Hunt
[44:41.610 --> 44:44.610]  Yeah, everybody was trying to hit me up, hit up Hunt
[44:44.610 --> 44:46.610]  Everybody was hitting up Adam Mill trying to get into the event
[44:46.610 --> 44:48.610]  You guys, there's one way to get into the secret sesh
[44:48.610 --> 44:50.610]  You have to go to the Instagram, you have to follow the rules
[44:50.610 --> 44:52.610]  And either you get in or you don't
[44:52.610 --> 44:53.610]  Yeah, pretty simple
[44:53.610 --> 44:55.610]  You guys were very apparent about the rules
[44:55.610 --> 44:57.610]  I can't help you
[44:57.610 --> 44:59.610]  They were quick to respond
[44:59.610 --> 45:01.610]  Hunt can't help you, Adam Mill can't help you
[45:01.610 --> 45:05.610]  Unless you're already in our crew and on the list of promoters or vendors or sponsors
[45:05.610 --> 45:08.610]  You gotta pay and you gotta try to get in like everybody else
[45:08.610 --> 45:09.610]  But uh
[45:09.610 --> 45:11.610]  No fancy treatment here
[45:11.610 --> 45:12.610]  Yeah, yeah
[45:12.610 --> 45:13.610]  I was even there
[45:13.610 --> 45:16.610]  Big shout out to Adam Mill, of course, for hosting the event
[45:16.610 --> 45:17.610]  Yeah man
[45:17.610 --> 45:19.610]  Whaaaaat?
[45:19.610 --> 45:20.610]  Sad that I missed him, man
[45:20.610 --> 45:21.610]  He's a good dude
[45:21.610 --> 45:22.610]  He's a Christian
[45:22.610 --> 45:24.610]  Chris Stoner, Adam Macintoshes, that's my buddy
[45:24.610 --> 45:26.610]  Make sure you guys follow Adam Blunts on Facebook
[45:26.610 --> 45:27.610]  He's a cool dude
[45:27.610 --> 45:28.610]  Really cool dude
[45:28.610 --> 45:30.610]  Dabber, Dab-o-ficionado, look chic
[45:30.610 --> 45:32.610]  Also, huge shout out to my buddy DJ Juggie
[45:32.610 --> 45:36.610]  Juggie is the DJ that's on some of Task Rock's material
[45:36.610 --> 45:37.610]  Oh cool
[45:37.610 --> 45:41.610]  And I think I've met Juggie one other time but it was more crowded
[45:41.610 --> 45:43.610]  I actually was blessed enough to be hanging out in the green room
[45:43.610 --> 45:45.610]  I had a little green room pass this time
[45:45.610 --> 45:47.610]  We were all hanging out in the green room
[45:47.610 --> 45:49.610]  And Juggie's just a cool ass, level-headed dude
[45:49.610 --> 45:51.610]  He's mellow, he's calm, he's a fucking classy adult
[45:51.610 --> 45:52.610]  So shout out to that dude
[45:52.610 --> 45:54.610]  Huge shout out to Nick Mailman
[45:54.610 --> 45:56.610]  I'd never met Nick Mailman until Secret Sash
[45:56.610 --> 45:57.610]  Nick's the homie
[45:57.610 --> 45:58.610]  Dude, that guy's cool as fuck
[45:58.610 --> 46:00.610]  Why haven't I met that guy before?
[46:00.610 --> 46:01.610]  We need to be friends
[46:01.610 --> 46:02.610]  Nick, let's dab bro, let's hang out
[46:02.610 --> 46:04.610]  Also to, I'm not sure if that's your girlfriend or your wife
[46:04.610 --> 46:05.610]  His wife
[46:05.610 --> 46:06.610]  His wife, she's cool too, very friendly
[46:06.610 --> 46:07.610]  Very sweet lady
[46:07.610 --> 46:08.610]  Yeah, very nice
[46:08.610 --> 46:11.610]  Also, huge shout out to my bald-headed friend John Anthony Moses
[46:11.610 --> 46:13.610]  And his lovely wife
[46:13.610 --> 46:16.610]  John follows the show quite religiously
[46:16.610 --> 46:18.610]  And he's, John you're a fanboy bro
[46:18.610 --> 46:20.610]  I like you being a fanboy
[46:20.610 --> 46:21.610]  I like that, yeah, I just called you a fanboy
[46:21.610 --> 46:22.610]  I appreciate it dude
[46:22.610 --> 46:24.610]  That is cool, thanks for supporting the show, for following me
[46:24.610 --> 46:27.610]  For all the love that you showed me at the Secret Sash
[46:27.610 --> 46:29.610]  Also, shout out to Cooper Watts
[46:29.610 --> 46:31.610]  I'd never met the dude in person until Secret Sash
[46:31.610 --> 46:34.610]  He actually works at the Green and Healthy Wellness
[46:34.610 --> 46:36.610]  That's known as Nuggz in Denver
[46:36.610 --> 46:38.610]  Cool ass dude, it was cool to finally meet him
[46:38.610 --> 46:41.610]  Also, shout out to Tony from LA who works the camera
[46:41.610 --> 46:43.610]  I feel like a dick smoking this in front of a white mic
[46:43.610 --> 46:46.610]  He's not big on the blunts anyway, so you're not hurting his feelings too much
[46:46.610 --> 46:47.610]  Good
[46:47.610 --> 46:50.610]  I enjoy them, but yeah, don't feel bad about leaving me out
[46:50.610 --> 46:53.610]  I feel bad about risking getting you guys sick at all
[46:53.610 --> 46:56.610]  I don't want to join the blunt, that's just too much
[46:56.610 --> 46:57.610]  You can have that back my friend
[46:57.610 --> 46:58.610]  I will
[46:58.610 --> 47:00.610]  I'm gonna give a shout out to Official Tim also
[47:00.610 --> 47:02.610]  Did I do Official Tim? I might have skipped him
[47:02.610 --> 47:04.610]  Shout out to Official Tim
[47:04.610 --> 47:05.610]  Secret Sash Tim

[47:17.610 --> 47:20.610]  Huge shout out to all of the seed companies
[47:20.610 --> 47:21.610]  Oh my gosh
[47:21.610 --> 47:22.610]  Is there a bunch of them?
[47:22.610 --> 47:26.610]  This is a bag of seeds that was gifted to me from one seed breeder
[47:26.610 --> 47:28.610]  Yeah, one breeder gave me this bag
[47:28.610 --> 47:30.610]  So just imagine what my backpack looks like
[47:30.610 --> 47:31.610]  That's awesome
[47:31.610 --> 47:33.610]  I was gifted seeds from, this is from
[47:34.610 --> 47:35.610]  I want to make sure I get it right
[47:35.610 --> 47:36.610]  Concentrated Genetics
[47:36.610 --> 47:39.610]  Cool, shout out to them because they hook you the fuck up
[47:39.610 --> 47:40.610]  You guys aren't in the room to see it
[47:40.610 --> 47:42.610]  But homie pulled out a big bag
[47:42.610 --> 47:44.610]  I call that a quarter pound bag
[47:44.610 --> 47:45.610]  Yeah, easy
[47:45.610 --> 47:46.610]  That's a quarter pound bag filled with seeds
[47:46.610 --> 47:49.610]  And then also shout out to La Plata Labs
[47:49.610 --> 47:50.610]  Josh is the shit

[47:54.610 --> 47:55.610]  Some Thai food, I'm down to hang out
[47:55.610 --> 47:56.610]  That sounds like a plan
[47:56.610 --> 47:57.610]  Yeah, there we go
[47:57.610 --> 47:58.610]  All of us, we're gonna go get Thai food
[47:58.610 --> 48:00.610]  We'll invite more potheads, we'll go have a good time
[48:00.610 --> 48:02.610]  I think that's all the shout outs I need to give
[48:02.610 --> 48:04.610]  If I skipped you, I fucking apologize
[48:04.610 --> 48:08.610]  Like I said, I smoked like 6 or 7 grams of Shatter at the Secret Sash
[48:08.610 --> 48:10.610]  I appreciate everybody that hung out
[48:10.610 --> 48:11.610]  I made some new friends
[48:11.610 --> 48:14.610]  I know David from Rare was there too
[48:14.610 --> 48:15.610]  Mary...
[48:15.610 --> 48:18.610]  Oh dude, I know your name and I can't think of it right now
[48:18.610 --> 48:19.610]  Mary's Motivation, I think
[48:19.610 --> 48:20.610]  Oh, Brett
[48:20.610 --> 48:21.610]  Brett's the homie
[48:21.610 --> 48:22.610]  Yeah, that guy's cool as fuck
[48:22.610 --> 48:23.610]  Absolutely
[48:23.610 --> 48:24.610]  He wore a Brett CBD hoodie
[48:24.610 --> 48:25.610]  Oh, that's what's up
[48:25.610 --> 48:26.610]  I'm glad he was repping for sure
[48:26.610 --> 48:28.610]  Yeah, dude, he's a great dude
[48:28.610 --> 48:29.610]  Yeah, good ass dude
[48:29.610 --> 48:30.610]  Yeah, man
[48:30.610 --> 48:31.610]  It was really cool to meet all those people
[48:31.610 --> 48:33.610]  I'm sorry if I didn't give you a shout out
[48:33.610 --> 48:35.610]  Because like I said, we got dabbed the fuck out
[48:35.610 --> 48:37.610]  I had to run to the green room and get snacks one time
[48:37.610 --> 48:40.610]  I was like, I'm so high, I gotta go to the green room and get snacks
[48:40.610 --> 48:41.610]  I abused the shit out of that green room
[48:41.610 --> 48:42.610]  It was really nice
[48:44.610 --> 48:46.610]  You have a booth and stuff at the Cup
[48:46.610 --> 48:48.610]  Do you ever get to where you just need a fucking break?
[48:48.610 --> 48:50.610]  You're like, I love everybody and this is fun
[48:50.610 --> 48:54.610]  But I just wanna go not talk to people and just not be here for a minute
[48:54.610 --> 48:56.610]  Yeah, you don't get that on a year that you win a Cup
[48:56.610 --> 48:57.610]  Right
[48:57.610 --> 48:59.610]  But the green room was an amazing place to have
[48:59.610 --> 49:00.610]  I've never had that before
[49:00.610 --> 49:01.610]  That's awesome
[49:01.610 --> 49:02.610]  Yeah, that sounds amazing
[49:02.610 --> 49:04.610]  Like snacks and a chill place
[49:04.610 --> 49:06.610]  No, but you're totally... yes
[49:06.610 --> 49:07.610]  Couches and shit
[49:07.610 --> 49:09.610]  At a Cup, that's like a unicorn
[49:09.610 --> 49:13.610]  I got to sit down for like 20 minutes and not like do anything
[49:13.610 --> 49:14.610]  While I take dabs
[49:14.610 --> 49:17.610]  And then I had my girlfriend at the time helping
[49:17.610 --> 49:19.610]  And a friend from Miami
[49:19.610 --> 49:21.610]  And yeah
[49:22.610 --> 49:24.610]  I was so tired after day three
[49:24.610 --> 49:27.610]  That cannabis Cup was the first time you and I ever shook hands and met face to face
[49:27.610 --> 49:28.610]  Very true
[49:28.610 --> 49:30.610]  And you gave me one of those banana bars
[49:30.610 --> 49:33.610]  Yes, and then I ended up getting some Arise
[49:34.610 --> 49:35.610]  Yeah, yep
[49:35.610 --> 49:36.610]  Some Arise seeds
[49:36.610 --> 49:38.610]  I think maybe something else, I'm not sure
[49:38.610 --> 49:40.610]  But yes, oh, the black cherry cams
[49:40.610 --> 49:42.610]  Oh yeah, because that's what you asked for specifically
[49:42.610 --> 49:43.610]  Yes, absolutely
[49:43.610 --> 49:44.610]  I was like, yes, your black cherry cam
[49:44.610 --> 49:46.610]  That was the whole reason I've been following you for a while
[49:46.610 --> 49:48.610]  I have to mention this while we're on this topic
[49:48.610 --> 49:50.610]  You guys, I love the support
[49:50.610 --> 49:51.610]  I love the cravings for my seeds
[49:51.610 --> 49:52.610]  But I cannot ship you seeds
[49:52.610 --> 49:54.610]  I apologize, that is illegal
[49:54.610 --> 49:55.610]  I can't do it
[49:55.610 --> 49:56.610]  So all you guys that are emailing me
[49:56.610 --> 49:57.610]  That are hitting me up through the podcast
[49:57.610 --> 49:59.610]  I'd love to get you some seeds
[49:59.610 --> 50:01.610]  The way that you might be able to get seeds
[50:01.610 --> 50:03.610]  Is to go to thedankteam.com
[50:03.610 --> 50:05.610]  And see what's available
[50:05.610 --> 50:07.610]  They may have iReed genetics, they may not
[50:07.610 --> 50:10.610]  I can recommend to you Mile High, La Plata, Sin City
[50:10.610 --> 50:12.610]  I can highly recommend Rare Dankness
[50:12.610 --> 50:15.610]  Kali Connection has a lot of cool shit
[50:15.610 --> 50:17.610]  But I cannot send you seeds, you guys
[50:17.610 --> 50:19.610]  I apologize, I'm not trying to be an asshole
[50:19.610 --> 50:21.610]  That's just how it is in my life
[50:21.610 --> 50:22.610]  I cannot send you seeds
[50:22.610 --> 50:23.610]  Gotta be careful
[50:23.610 --> 50:24.610]  Ditto
[50:24.610 --> 50:26.610]  You can come here and I can give you some seeds
[50:26.610 --> 50:28.610]  Well, I sent out a bunch of free CBD seeds
[50:28.610 --> 50:29.610]  But, you know
[50:30.610 --> 50:31.610]  They're all like
[50:31.610 --> 50:33.610]  It's all pretty much verified hemp
[50:33.610 --> 50:35.610]  And I did it for a very short amount of time
[50:35.610 --> 50:38.610]  Where I was like, yeah, I'm sending out 32 to 1's
[50:38.610 --> 50:39.610]  There you go
[50:39.610 --> 50:41.610]  And then I had to do it again
[50:41.610 --> 50:42.610]  For that same reason
[50:42.610 --> 50:43.610]  If you need CBD seeds
[50:43.610 --> 50:44.610]  Come to Colorado and Fox and I will hook you up
[50:44.610 --> 50:46.610]  With handfuls of free CBD seeds
[50:46.610 --> 50:47.610]  But yeah, but there's
[50:47.610 --> 50:49.610]  Like you said, Rare Dankness, La Plata Labs
[50:49.610 --> 50:52.610]  Mile High, Can Adventure, Sour Seed Company
[50:52.610 --> 50:53.610]  Absolutely
[50:53.610 --> 50:54.610]  They're all good friends of ours
[50:54.610 --> 50:55.610]  Yeah, Mr. Nice
[50:55.610 --> 50:57.610]  Mr. Nice, from old school, back in the day
[50:57.610 --> 50:58.610]  Yes, absolutely
[50:58.610 --> 51:02.610]  I'm actually grabbing a big chunk of mango hay seeds
[51:02.610 --> 51:04.610]  Because it just came known to me
[51:04.610 --> 51:06.610]  That that was the strain that I grew up on
[51:06.610 --> 51:08.610]  I think we have a similar friend
[51:08.610 --> 51:09.610]  Oh, no way
[51:09.610 --> 51:11.610]  Yeah, somebody's just trying to give me mango hay seeds
[51:11.610 --> 51:12.610]  Nice
[51:12.610 --> 51:13.610]  Shout out to that person
[51:13.610 --> 51:14.610]  They know who they are
[51:14.610 --> 51:15.610]  They don't want to be public
[51:15.610 --> 51:16.610]  No, well, yeah
[51:16.610 --> 51:17.610]  I can't wait to get my hands on these
[51:17.610 --> 51:18.610]  And, you know, get back to that
[51:18.610 --> 51:19.610]  Find that
[51:19.610 --> 51:21.610]  What I grew up on, you know
[51:21.610 --> 51:22.610]  Yeah
[51:22.610 --> 51:25.610]  Alright, so we talked about the events that we did attend
[51:25.610 --> 51:27.610]  And then you kind of hinted at events getting busted
[51:27.610 --> 51:29.610]  Yes, quite a few
[51:29.610 --> 51:32.610]  The Colorado Cup, shout out to Steve DeFino
[51:32.610 --> 51:33.610]  Yeah, we'll get into that too
[51:33.610 --> 51:35.610]  Because he's a good friend
[51:35.610 --> 51:37.610]  Yeah, we should get him on here to talk about this
[51:37.610 --> 51:40.610]  But the Colorado Cup was raided
[51:40.610 --> 51:42.610]  And I've actually got a copy of the search warrant on my phone
[51:42.610 --> 51:43.610]  If we wanted to read it
[51:43.610 --> 51:44.610]  But I don't even know
[51:44.610 --> 51:45.610]  I don't know if we should delve into that
[51:45.610 --> 51:47.610]  Well, that might be interesting, actually
[51:47.610 --> 51:49.610]  They claim to have found some drugs, actually
[51:49.610 --> 51:50.610]  Oh, really?
[51:50.610 --> 51:51.610]  Yeah, in the DJ booth
[51:51.610 --> 51:52.610]  They claim there was some drugs in the DJ booth
[51:52.610 --> 51:53.610]  No shit
[51:53.610 --> 51:56.610]  But also, the DJ booth was the only room without a camera
[51:57.610 --> 51:58.610]  So, who knows
[51:58.610 --> 51:59.610]  Yeah
[51:59.610 --> 52:01.610]  You know, it's hard to say what happened there
[52:01.610 --> 52:02.610]  Definitely
[52:02.610 --> 52:04.610]  So, there was an event at a place called Riggs R Us
[52:04.610 --> 52:05.610]  And it was the Colorado Cup
[52:05.610 --> 52:07.610]  And it was an event similar to a Cannabis Cup
[52:07.610 --> 52:10.610]  Where people enter their strains of cannabis, extracts, edibles
[52:10.610 --> 52:11.610]  And cannabis wares and whatnots
[52:11.610 --> 52:12.610]  And people judge them
[52:12.610 --> 52:14.610]  And they decided a winner
[52:14.610 --> 52:16.610]  On 420 at 3pm
[52:16.610 --> 52:18.610]  The Denver City Police came in
[52:18.610 --> 52:21.610]  With bandanas on their faces and shotguns in their hands
[52:21.610 --> 52:23.610]  Kicked in the front doors and started yelling
[52:23.610 --> 52:24.610]  Get out, get out, get out
[52:24.610 --> 52:26.610]  And half of the people that were in there
[52:26.610 --> 52:27.610]  Thought the place was getting robbed
[52:27.610 --> 52:29.610]  Because they did not announce that they were police
[52:29.610 --> 52:31.610]  Until everybody left and everybody was on the ground
[52:31.610 --> 52:34.610]  Then a uniformed officer walked in and delivered a search warrant
[52:34.610 --> 52:35.610]  Huh
[52:35.610 --> 52:36.610]  Yeah, after everything was all
[52:36.610 --> 52:38.610]  Yeah, so everybody thought the place was getting fucking robbed
[52:38.610 --> 52:39.610]  I had a friend who was there
[52:39.610 --> 52:41.610]  She sent me a bunch of stuff
[52:41.610 --> 52:42.610]  Wow
[52:42.610 --> 52:43.610]  Yeah, she sent me a video from the place
[52:43.610 --> 52:45.610]  The cops that first went in
[52:45.610 --> 52:49.610]  Just looked like thugs in dickies and combat boots and bandanas
[52:49.610 --> 52:51.610]  And they were followed by armed cops
[52:51.610 --> 52:53.610]  Who were then followed by, like, riot cops
[52:54.610 --> 52:56.610]  Just to come shut down an illegal smoke
[52:56.610 --> 52:59.610]  A bunch of peaceful fucking stoners
[52:59.610 --> 53:00.610]  Yeah, exactly
[53:00.610 --> 53:02.610]  They needed riot gear
[53:02.610 --> 53:03.610]  How much of our tax money was that?
[53:03.610 --> 53:04.610]  A lot
[53:04.610 --> 53:05.610]  And actually
[53:05.610 --> 53:07.610]  Sounds like 60 grand from what you just said
[53:07.610 --> 53:11.610]  There were several Macbooks being used for data entry
[53:11.610 --> 53:12.610]  For the cup that was happening
[53:12.610 --> 53:15.610]  And these cops poured bottled water all over the Macbooks
[53:15.610 --> 53:16.610]  Are you fucking serious?
[53:16.610 --> 53:17.610]  Just dumped bottles of water over the Macbooks
[53:17.610 --> 53:18.610]  Wow
[53:18.610 --> 53:19.610]  Yeah, for no reason
[53:19.610 --> 53:20.610]  Destruction of property
[53:20.610 --> 53:21.610]  Allegedly, I was not there
[53:21.610 --> 53:23.610]  No, yeah, yeah, but I mean, you know
[53:23.610 --> 53:25.610]  Those are some serious claims, you know
[53:25.610 --> 53:26.610]  Shout out to my source on the street
[53:26.610 --> 53:30.610]  Yeah, and the Denver PD doesn't have the cleanest record
[53:30.610 --> 53:34.610]  For how they deal with public affairs
[53:34.610 --> 53:35.610]  Do we want to read any of the
[53:35.610 --> 53:36.610]  I can read you
[53:36.610 --> 53:37.610]  Absolutely
[53:37.610 --> 53:39.610]  There was 38 charges filed against these folks
[53:39.610 --> 53:40.610]  I can go find the message
[53:40.610 --> 53:41.610]  Okay, so while you find the message
[53:41.610 --> 53:44.610]  I'll delve into AJ Hashman a little bit
[53:44.610 --> 53:45.610]  What's up, AJ?
[53:45.610 --> 53:47.610]  So, here's the thing with AJ
[53:47.610 --> 53:50.610]  And I'm not one to talk shit or say anything ill of anyone
[53:50.610 --> 53:53.610]  But I'll tell you my first experience with him
[53:53.610 --> 53:57.610]  Back last year, do you remember the Gypsy Jane fest?
[53:57.610 --> 53:58.610]  A little bit
[53:58.610 --> 54:00.610]  I did attend it, but I remember seeing the posts
[54:00.610 --> 54:01.610]  It was a huge joke
[54:01.610 --> 54:03.610]  I mean, they got Snoop to come in
[54:03.610 --> 54:06.610]  To do whatever he did for a few minutes
[54:06.610 --> 54:09.610]  Half the artists didn't show up
[54:09.610 --> 54:12.610]  The company running it lied about ticket sales
[54:12.610 --> 54:14.610]  A lot of vendors got fucked
[54:14.610 --> 54:17.610]  Some people bought $40,000 booths and recouped nothing
[54:18.610 --> 54:21.610]  On top of that, it was like a three-day event
[54:21.610 --> 54:23.610]  And on the second day, a lot of these people's stuff
[54:23.610 --> 54:24.610]  Got broken into
[54:24.610 --> 54:27.610]  And the guys that came in to promote the event
[54:27.610 --> 54:29.610]  And help build it, it all left
[54:29.610 --> 54:31.610]  And left everything high and dry
[54:31.610 --> 54:33.610]  So, AJ's role in this was
[54:33.610 --> 54:37.610]  They had seeked him out to do the
[54:37.610 --> 54:43.610]  Judging portion of the edible competition
[54:43.610 --> 54:46.610]  And concentrate competition
[54:46.610 --> 54:47.610]  And what ended up happening was
[54:47.610 --> 54:50.610]  He took like 17 grams or 14
[54:50.610 --> 54:52.610]  I can't remember, it was over half an ounce
[54:52.610 --> 54:54.610]  Of concentrate from us
[54:54.610 --> 54:57.610]  And told us that no dispensaries would be entering
[54:57.610 --> 55:00.610]  And that it would just be an independent thing
[55:00.610 --> 55:01.610]  And I said, sure, why not?
[55:01.610 --> 55:02.610]  I mean, my roommate at the time got some flour
[55:02.610 --> 55:05.610]  We ran it, whatever the case was
[55:05.610 --> 55:07.610]  And, you know, it was okay
[55:07.610 --> 55:10.610]  But, fuck, I can't remember the name of them
[55:10.610 --> 55:13.610]  The clinic or someone who had just gone wreck
[55:13.610 --> 55:16.610]  Came in and bought fucking ounces of this shit
[55:16.610 --> 55:19.610]  And turned in category, entry for every category
[55:19.610 --> 55:22.610]  And just kind of voided everything he said
[55:22.610 --> 55:25.610]  So, on top of that, we found out that
[55:25.610 --> 55:27.610]  My entry was never judged
[55:27.610 --> 55:28.610]  And this was a year ago
[55:28.610 --> 55:30.610]  So let's flash forward to Colorado Cup
[55:30.610 --> 55:34.610]  Steve DeFino and his flour entry
[55:34.610 --> 55:35.610]  He had two entries
[55:35.610 --> 55:37.610]  His Cheesequake, which I can personally say
[55:37.610 --> 55:39.610]  As an extractor, as a grower, as a breeder
[55:39.610 --> 55:41.610]  You know, dude, he does great fucking work
[55:41.610 --> 55:42.610]  I'd love to extract it
[55:42.610 --> 55:44.610]  I'd love to squish it
[55:44.610 --> 55:46.610]  It's super terpy material, I love it
[55:48.610 --> 55:51.610]  He also entered your Heart of Gold
[55:51.610 --> 55:52.610]  Heart of Gold, yes
[55:52.610 --> 55:53.610]  Which is a Golden Goat cross
[55:53.610 --> 55:54.610]  Golden Goat, Grateful Dog
[55:54.610 --> 55:58.610]  Yeah, so very sativa dominant cross, you would say
[55:58.610 --> 55:59.610]  Oh, yeah
[55:59.610 --> 56:00.610]  Okay, so
[56:02.610 --> 56:04.610]  In the whole scheme of things, you know
[56:04.610 --> 56:07.610]  Like you just said, it got raided
[56:07.610 --> 56:10.610]  Steve almost lost his, you know, possessions
[56:10.610 --> 56:11.610]  Or whatever the case was
[56:11.610 --> 56:12.610]  Because of that whole thing
[56:12.610 --> 56:13.610]  He ended up getting in
[56:13.610 --> 56:14.610]  And they were giving him shit
[56:14.610 --> 56:15.610]  Or whatever the case was
[56:15.610 --> 56:17.610]  But he didn't find out until a few days later
[56:17.610 --> 56:19.610]  After they announced the winnings
[56:19.610 --> 56:22.610]  That his entries weren't even judged
[56:22.610 --> 56:25.610]  Which, you know, is typical of something that AJ would do
[56:25.610 --> 56:28.610]  Now let's rewind a little bit again
[56:28.610 --> 56:29.610]  He would do these things
[56:29.610 --> 56:31.610]  And promote these events called Can-a-Raves
[56:31.610 --> 56:33.610]  And whatever the case was
[56:33.610 --> 56:34.610]  I wasn't really around for them
[56:34.610 --> 56:35.610]  I've just only heard
[56:35.610 --> 56:37.610]  And it's the same similar thing
[56:37.610 --> 56:38.610]  He wouldn't get permits for anything
[56:38.610 --> 56:40.610]  The cops would constantly come to the events
[56:40.610 --> 56:42.610]  The vendors would get fucked
[56:42.610 --> 56:43.610]  Because he would collect money
[56:43.610 --> 56:47.610]  He was charging more money for what he was like
[56:47.610 --> 56:50.610]  Oh, if you want your entry tested, $40
[56:50.610 --> 56:52.610]  What that actually cost was $25
[56:52.610 --> 56:57.610]  So he was actually skimming off the top of every entry
[56:57.610 --> 57:00.610]  That, you know, that was made on top of what he was getting
[57:00.610 --> 57:03.610]  So it's kind of like, you know
[57:03.610 --> 57:06.610]  I can understand why someone would be upset
[57:06.610 --> 57:08.610]  Steve, our good friend Steve
[57:08.610 --> 57:11.610]  Was not too happy when he heard that, you know
[57:11.610 --> 57:13.610]  And it was verified
[57:13.610 --> 57:16.610]  And I just feel like
[57:16.610 --> 57:19.610]  One, people with that kind of track record
[57:19.610 --> 57:20.610]  Should just not do events
[57:20.610 --> 57:22.610]  I have nothing ill to say about AJ, dude
[57:22.610 --> 57:24.610]  Fucking hell, smoke with you, whatever
[57:24.610 --> 57:26.610]  But I can't say the same for Steve
[57:26.610 --> 57:27.610]  Or some of the other competitors
[57:27.610 --> 57:29.610]  That you kind of fucked over
[57:29.610 --> 57:30.610]  So that being said
[57:30.610 --> 57:33.610]  Me and Steve have been talking about
[57:33.610 --> 57:35.610]  Authenticity and competition
[57:35.610 --> 57:37.610]  And trying to do something more towards that
[57:37.610 --> 57:40.610]  But that was a huge bust on their part
[57:40.610 --> 57:42.610]  Of the competition
[57:42.610 --> 57:45.610]  And, you know, yeah
[57:45.610 --> 57:47.610]  I wish it hadn't gone that way
[57:47.610 --> 57:49.610]  When people told me about the Colorado Cup
[57:49.610 --> 57:51.610]  I asked who was throwing it
[57:51.610 --> 57:52.610]  And when I heard who it was
[57:52.610 --> 57:54.610]  I kind of had to pull from it
[57:54.610 --> 57:57.610]  Knowing that, one, the cops really had to get involved
[57:57.610 --> 57:59.610]  Or two, my entry is going to be taken
[57:59.610 --> 58:01.610]  And, you know, it could just go to Patience
[58:01.610 --> 58:02.610]  If that's the case, you know
[58:02.610 --> 58:03.610]  Like, why bother?
[58:04.610 --> 58:06.610]  So that reminds me that I did not do a shout-out
[58:06.610 --> 58:08.610]  To the venue where we held the secret sesh
[58:08.610 --> 58:11.610]  I don't know that I want to say the name of the venue
[58:11.610 --> 58:12.610]  Because we're going to do it again
[58:12.610 --> 58:13.610]  No, because it's a secret, dog
[58:13.610 --> 58:14.610]  And it's a secret
[58:14.610 --> 58:15.610]  So big shout-out to the venue
[58:15.610 --> 58:16.610]  You know who you are
[58:16.610 --> 58:17.610]  It's cool as fuck
[58:17.610 --> 58:20.610]  That place is rad, dude, yeah
[58:20.610 --> 58:21.610]  Word on the street is
[58:21.610 --> 58:23.610]  We're doing secret sesh again in May
[58:23.610 --> 58:26.610]  And there's a good chance that Rasta Jeff
[58:26.610 --> 58:27.610]  Will be the co-host
[58:27.610 --> 58:29.610]  Because in June and July
[58:29.610 --> 58:31.610]  I will be the host of the secret sesh
[58:31.610 --> 58:32.610]  If things go our way
[58:32.610 --> 58:33.610]  Cool
[58:33.610 --> 58:34.610]  I might not be supposed to say that
[58:34.610 --> 58:35.610]  So only listeners can know that shit
[58:35.610 --> 58:36.610]  Don't tell anybody, you guys
[58:36.610 --> 58:37.610]  Yeah, don't tell
[58:37.610 --> 58:38.610]  It's all a secret, yeah
[58:38.610 --> 58:40.610]  Yeah, Adamil and I are going to get together
[58:40.610 --> 58:41.610]  And talk a little bit about it
[58:41.610 --> 58:42.610]  I'll probably be hosting
[58:42.610 --> 58:43.610]  What?
[58:43.610 --> 58:44.610]  Yeah
[58:44.610 --> 58:45.610]  What?
[58:45.610 --> 58:46.610]  Yeah
[58:46.610 --> 58:47.610]  What?
[58:47.610 --> 58:49.610]  It's going to get ridiculous up there
[58:49.610 --> 58:51.610]  So I found a list of
[58:51.610 --> 58:53.610]  This is the inventory that was confiscated
[58:53.610 --> 58:54.610]  By the Denver Police
[58:54.610 --> 58:55.610]  Oh, interesting
[58:55.610 --> 58:57.610]  And there are 20 articles
[58:57.610 --> 58:59.610]  20 items listed on the front page
[58:59.610 --> 59:01.610]  And it says, number one
[59:01.610 --> 59:02.610]  Marijuana concentrate
[59:02.610 --> 59:03.610]  In the basement storage area
[59:03.610 --> 59:04.610]  Number two
[59:04.610 --> 59:06.610]  Marijuana in the basement office
[59:06.610 --> 59:07.610]  Number three
[59:07.610 --> 59:08.610]  Marijuana concentrate
[59:08.610 --> 59:09.610]  In the basement storage
[59:09.610 --> 59:10.610]  They list marijuana concentrate
[59:10.610 --> 59:11.610]  Marijuana concentrate
[59:11.610 --> 59:12.610]  Marijuana basement
[59:13.610 --> 59:14.610]  Suspected meth basement
[59:15.610 --> 59:17.610]  Marijuana concentrate basement
[59:17.610 --> 59:19.610]  Marijuana dab room
[59:19.610 --> 59:21.610]  Marijuana concentrate basement bar
[59:21.610 --> 59:23.110]  Marijuana basement bar
[59:23.110 --> 59:25.610]  Marijuana cookies
[59:25.610 --> 59:27.610]  On the back patio
[59:27.610 --> 59:28.610]  Meth in DJ room
[59:28.610 --> 59:29.610]  Those might have been
[59:29.610 --> 59:30.610]  Someone's on there
[59:30.610 --> 59:33.170]  Unknown oil in the DJ room.
[59:33.170 --> 59:34.330]  Well, that's probably just Earl.
[59:34.330 --> 59:35.170]  That's probably some.
[59:35.170 --> 59:36.570]  That's probably reclaim and they're like,
[59:36.570 --> 59:39.330]  we're gonna charge them for this too.
[59:39.330 --> 59:41.090]  Suspected ecstasy in the DJ room.
[59:41.090 --> 59:42.770]  Suspected cocaine in the DJ room.
[59:42.770 --> 59:44.410]  Unknown oil in the DJ room.
[59:44.410 --> 59:46.730]  Marijuana near press outside.
[59:46.730 --> 59:51.730]  Yeah, that's, that's charges.
[59:52.610 --> 59:54.090]  It's very funny.
[59:54.090 --> 59:55.490]  Let's see marijuana.
[59:55.490 --> 59:57.890]  Just Jim's crystal collection.
[59:57.890 --> 01:00:00.090]  Wallet with ID in the DJ room.
[01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:01.810]  Scale in the DJ room.
[01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.810]  So this piece of paper right here leads me to believe
[01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:05.370]  that the DJ is fucked.
[01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:09.970]  Unless it's AJ's ID in the DJ room.
[01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:10.890]  Oh man.
[01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.330]  I just, the legal disclaimer,
[01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:15.850]  Ross and Jeff and the Girl From Your Heart podcast
[01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:18.370]  has no evidence against AJ Hashman in any wrongdoing.
[01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:21.170]  These are all the opinions of Kabuki J Fox.
[01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:22.730]  This is all allegedly.
[01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:24.490]  Whatever other legal ground we have to cover there.
[01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:25.330]  Who knows?
[01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.530]  The same goes, this is all the,
[01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:28.810]  I'm telling you my personal experience with him.
[01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:31.250]  I'm in no way trying to.
[01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:32.650]  Mike just got a phone call and says he has to go.
[01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:34.290]  We're going to press pause and I'm going to check on my friend
[01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:35.130]  make things are good.
[01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:36.170]  And we'll be right back with the podcast.
[01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:37.010]  Yes folks.
[01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:37.850]  Sorry.
[01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:38.690]  I got her bused.
[01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:40.730]  All right, you guys, we are back.
[01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:41.570]  Mike had to take off.
[01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:43.090]  I apologize for having to cut off the show.
[01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:43.930]  Everything is cool.
[01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:46.050]  Mike just had to give somebody an unexpected ride.
[01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:46.890]  Not an emergency.
[01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:48.010]  Shout out to Mike.
[01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:49.770]  Shout out to the little guy.
[01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:51.610]  I hope the prom went well, my friend.
[01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:53.410]  All right.
[01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:54.250]  So where were we?
[01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.370]  We were kind of in the middle of slandering AJ Hashman.
[01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:57.210]  Yeah.
[01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:58.050]  Well, not really.
[01:00:58.090 --> 01:00:58.930]  I'm expressing my views,
[01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:00.770]  which had nothing to do with you, by the way.
[01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:02.170]  Thank you for letting me express them.
[01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:04.970]  But I am expressing them on the behalf of my friend, Steve,
[01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:07.930]  who really feels like he got shafted.
[01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.610]  And it's just unfortunate, you know,
[01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:12.490]  cause I tried to warn him and him being a good person,
[01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:13.890]  tried to give him the benefit of the doubt.
[01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:15.490]  And hey, it's like,
[01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:19.210]  it's like chlamydia.
[01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:21.890]  You learn your lesson once with that shit.
[01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:24.530]  And AJ is just kind of like dealing with him
[01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:27.010]  in a business sense is never a wonderful thing.
[01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.850]  You're not looking to go back and get burned twice.
[01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:30.490]  No, absolutely.
[01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:32.490]  So you learn your lesson and that's it.
[01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:33.330]  That is what it is.
[01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:35.530]  I'm gonna give a shout out to Steve DeFino.
[01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:37.250]  Steve DeFino, if you'd like to come on the podcast,
[01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.850]  once again, we can meet up at the Canyon.
[01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:39.690]  You can come to my house.
[01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:40.690]  I know you're in Colorado Springs.
[01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:42.250]  So it may be easier for me to come to you.
[01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:44.090]  You should come down to Pueblo, Steve.
[01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:46.370]  Well, either way, there's a third chair now since Mike left.
[01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.130]  So Steve, you're invited.
[01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:49.690]  Anyway, Steve, I'd love to have you on the show.
[01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:51.330]  If you've got anything you'd ever like to say,
[01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:52.810]  if you'd like to talk about the VFA,
[01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.610]  if you'd like to talk about events,
[01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:56.450]  bro, this is partly your show as well.
[01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:58.170]  You've always got a welcome seat on the show.
[01:01:58.170 --> 01:01:59.050]  I appreciate what you do.
[01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:00.410]  I respect what you do.
[01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:01.930]  I've actually got an email from somebody
[01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:03.070]  who is trying to get in touch
[01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:04.330]  with the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:06.150]  So I do need to put you in touch with them.
[01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:07.130]  Steve, we appreciate you.
[01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.970]  That's what we're trying to say.
[01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:09.410]  You're part of the team, bro.
[01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:10.250]  We've got your back.
[01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.210]  We want to support you.
[01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:15.130]  So let's move on from the AJ Hashman,
[01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:16.450]  the Bashman session here.
[01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:19.410]  That was good.
[01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:21.610]  I'm gonna use that as a hashtag.
[01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:22.450]  Bashman.
[01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:23.930]  Hashman, Bashman.
[01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:26.450]  We're 30 minutes into this podcast.
[01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:29.370]  Let's talk about some CBD stuff.
[01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:31.690]  I've got a thing on my phone.
[01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:32.510]  Let me find it.
[01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:34.130]  I just took a screenshot of a message somebody sent me.
[01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:36.010]  I know everything is in our damn phones these days.
[01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:36.850]  Yeah, I know.
[01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:40.490]  It's crazy stupid how much these things are like lifelines.
[01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:43.490]  This guy says, I'm gonna summarize a little bit.
[01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:45.570]  He says his mother-in-law has Parkinson's
[01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:47.730]  and is really against pharmaceuticals.
[01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:49.690]  It's to the point where she's really getting bad.
[01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:52.030]  After listening to countless hours of my show,
[01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:54.110]  this listener figured that I may have an idea
[01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:56.830]  as far as strains and whatnot.
[01:02:56.830 --> 01:03:00.470]  She's onto the idea of medical marijuana,
[01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:04.130]  but has it in her mind that the CBD available in Texas
[01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:08.150]  will not help, and this person is sure that they won't.
[01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:09.510]  If we could please lay some knowledge
[01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:11.990]  on this listener about this,
[01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:14.830]  there's a whole family that would appreciate it.
[01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:17.070]  First of all, I'm gonna be a grammar Nazi.
[01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:19.710]  Let's correct the world here with CBDs.
[01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.510]  Let's just start saying CBD.
[01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:24.430]  CBDs is not pluralized.
[01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:27.310]  The same way that we don't pluralize THCs.
[01:03:27.310 --> 01:03:28.150]  Right.
[01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:30.230]  It's just, we don't do it.
[01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:31.310]  Or water.
[01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:32.550]  Yeah, water.
[01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:34.510]  Yeah, you don't say, I wanna get some waters.
[01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:36.350]  I wanna get all the waters out of this glass.
[01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:37.830]  It's, yeah, it's CBD.
[01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:40.230]  This is for everybody.
[01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:41.070]  Yeah.
[01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:42.870]  And also since I'm on this, it's not strands,
[01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:43.710]  it is strains.
[01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.630]  Strands are hair, strains are cannabis.
[01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:46.630]  If you wanna get specific,
[01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:48.590]  you could say cultivar or varietal,
[01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:51.150]  but let's just not say fucking strands.
[01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:52.950]  I haven't heard the strands in a while.
[01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:53.790]  Yeah, I heard it the other day.
[01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:54.630]  Sorry for my ego.
[01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:55.470]  I heard it the other day.
[01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:56.950]  It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.
[01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:59.550]  I was like, you're so pretty and you just said strands?
[01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:00.990]  I'm leaving.
[01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.830]  Yeah, bro.
[01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:04.150]  So this guy, and also since we are,
[01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:05.790]  we're making jokes about this,
[01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:09.630]  but I'm sorry, your mother-in-law has Parkinson's.
[01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:11.190]  That is terrible to hear about.
[01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:13.830]  And Fox is the guy here that is great at helping
[01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:14.990]  with this type of stuff.
[01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:18.350]  So first he wants to know if we can recommend a strain
[01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:19.950]  that would help with Parkinson's.
[01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:22.390]  Okay, so there's a few options.
[01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:25.870]  If she's okay with the cannabis,
[01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:28.110]  then there's a few one-to-one options that we can go with
[01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:29.590]  that would be wonderful.
[01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:32.870]  Tora Bora being one of them,
[01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:36.470]  Tora Sue, Harlequin,
[01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:39.470]  which I think comes in at a three to one or two to one,
[01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:43.530]  and certain cases seven to one, another great strain.
[01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:47.550]  If she's coming around or slowly coming around
[01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.230]  to the idea of medical cannabis,
[01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:53.070]  I would say start off with the higher CBD strains
[01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.230]  to higher ratio of CBD to THC.
[01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:57.990]  Auto from Centennial Seeds.
[01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:59.510]  Oh, that's a great example.
[01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:01.710]  So obviously you're in Texas,
[01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:03.310]  so your options are very limited,
[01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:07.950]  and unless you can get a specific cut of this,
[01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:11.070]  of what I'm talking about on the ACDC side at least,
[01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:13.470]  you're gonna have to go with something like the auto,
[01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:15.870]  but from what I understand, it's like 120 to one.
[01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:17.370]  And it's-
[01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:18.510]  So when he keeps saying, I'm gonna interrupt you,
[01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:21.270]  I'm sorry, he keeps saying 120 to one or two to one,
[01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:24.350]  we're talking about THC to CBD ratios,
[01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:27.190]  and we're trying to find the higher CBD ratio for you
[01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:28.010]  is what we need.
[01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.850]  Yes.
[01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:30.950]  So that she's not gonna get the killer head buzz,
[01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:32.670]  she's not gonna be high and giggly,
[01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:34.870]  she's actually gonna get the medicinal benefits
[01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:38.870]  from the cannabis because it's higher in CBD than THC.
[01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:39.710]  I just wanted to clear that up.
[01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:41.870]  You keep, I don't know how many people understand
[01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:42.710]  the ratio aspect of this.
[01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:43.550]  No, absolutely not.
[01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:45.510]  Thank you for-
[01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:47.070]  I try not to go past people too.
[01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:48.590]  No, you're fine, that's great.
[01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:50.750]  Because I forget to elaborate on that sometimes,
[01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:52.150]  I'm not the best at that.
[01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:54.870]  So yeah, that being said, and like you said,
[01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:57.830]  Centennial Seeds, auto would be great.
[01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:02.830]  I think CBD Crew is another seed company
[01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:04.230]  that would be able to help.
[01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:08.750]  Booms Farm also has some strains that are,
[01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:12.590]  like I said, you can tell them what your situation
[01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:16.150]  is where you are and they'll be able to help you
[01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:18.070]  with their strain list and give you something
[01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:21.670]  that will keep you in the legal boundaries
[01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:22.510]  of what you need.
[01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:24.870]  But to just, let's say with the auto.
[01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:26.430]  The autos are great to start off with
[01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:28.390]  and let's just say why.
[01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:31.350]  So CBD is a neuroprotectant.
[01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:35.470]  There's been a few cases done on the effects of CBD
[01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:39.910]  on Parkinson's and it absolutely helps
[01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:43.670]  with the confusion, it helps with the tremors,
[01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:48.110]  it helps with a lot of the symptoms that you see
[01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:50.870]  usually with that disease or anything
[01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:52.630]  and related to that condition.
[01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.950]  So yes, obviously it's a huge help.
[01:06:56.870 --> 01:07:00.350]  Tintures, sublingual dosing,
[01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:03.110]  and depending on what the case is,
[01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:05.110]  is usually, would be the quickest.
[01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:11.110]  There are CBD ready products that can also,
[01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:15.230]  that you can get, I'm sorry that the company's
[01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:16.830]  alluding me at this point,
[01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:19.910]  because I don't, I just can't think of it to mind,
[01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:21.710]  but there are those products available
[01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:24.830]  if you need something quicker than just growing,
[01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:26.150]  what will help her?
[01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:29.150]  Part of his question was that he does not believe
[01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:31.950]  that the CBD products available in Texas
[01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:33.430]  will be of much use.
[01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:34.830]  And I asked him more questions about this.
[01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:36.630]  We had a little short conversation
[01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:39.390]  on the Instagram messenger here.
[01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:40.790]  I asked him, he said he doesn't feel like
[01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:43.070]  the CBD available there in Texas will help.
[01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.430]  And he's sure that they won't.
[01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:46.750]  And then he asked me how I felt about that.
[01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:47.990]  And I asked why he doesn't feel like
[01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.070]  the CBD there will help.
[01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:50.030]  I have the same question.
[01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:53.470]  He said that he doesn't believe it's going to be CBD oil,
[01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:54.510]  which we've seen a lot.
[01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:56.310]  People say they sell CBD oil and it ends up
[01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:58.870]  just being 100% cod oil and they're just messing up.
[01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:01.070]  So then I'm gonna be more specific then.
[01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:05.270]  I'll start off by giving out my email,
[01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:07.750]  and this can go out and I don't mind,
[01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:10.670]  foxstrackcbd at gmail.com.
[01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:13.270]  Even if it's not directly through me,
[01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:16.350]  I will happily direct you through
[01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:21.350]  a verified hemp oil sale, growers, farmers, extractors.
[01:08:23.230 --> 01:08:25.030]  I also know a few slew of companies
[01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:27.790]  that already make 50 state ready CBD products
[01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:28.790]  that are legitimate.
[01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:30.910]  They're backed up by testing.
[01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:33.790]  We'll have testing for everything from potency,
[01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:37.190]  pesticides to mildew and heavy metals
[01:08:37.190 --> 01:08:39.150]  and an infused product.
[01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:44.150]  So yeah, I'm so sorry that it's living on the products,
[01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:48.830]  but you can always get at me and I will happily,
[01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:51.550]  I've got them all on my phone, which is right next to me.
[01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:53.310]  I will go ahead and take a look in your phone.
[01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:54.150]  Yeah, let me see.
[01:08:54.150 --> 01:08:55.950]  I'll do my best to get the links also.
[01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:57.590]  I'll get Fox's email address again
[01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:59.430]  so that you guys don't have to rewind the show.
[01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:01.870]  I'll put all this stuff in the show notes
[01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:03.750]  so that you guys can easily go and find that.
[01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:06.590]  I'll leave some links there in the show notes for you.
[01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:09.390]  That would be probably the most helpful thing that I can do.
[01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:11.710]  Is this CBD legal in Texas,
[01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:13.390]  the CBD product you're talking about?
[01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:14.390]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:15.550]  Okay.
[01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:18.590]  You know, I was working with Halo Labs for a while,
[01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:21.310]  which, and they were doing an isolate that was,
[01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:25.430]  we were getting back 99.5% versus 5, 7%.
[01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:29.550]  And I infused a lot of 50 state legal products
[01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:31.550]  with a lot of those hard candies and lollipops
[01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:33.030]  that I made were 50 state legal.
[01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:36.590]  And I sent those out for free to a lot of people
[01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:38.550]  because they were skeptical about that.
[01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.430]  And just to get an idea, some people,
[01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:43.470]  obviously we support whole plant cannabis.
[01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:45.790]  I mean, both is best.
[01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:46.910]  The whole plant is best.
[01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:49.550]  But if you're in a situation or have a condition
[01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:52.270]  where it's more neurologically tied,
[01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:55.630]  then higher concentrations of CBD is where you want to be.
[01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:57.870]  And so, you know, everything has its place.
[01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:59.830]  I don't knock one thing or another when it comes to,
[01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:02.910]  you know, anything cannabis related.
[01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:07.910]  So there is a company called CBD underscore Pure Med Slab.
[01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:17.430]  And they are some of the biggest wholesalers out here.
[01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:19.910]  And that's on Instagram.
[01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:24.950]  And I'll repeat that at CBD underscore Pure Med Slab.
[01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:28.590]  Sorry, I said it wrong the first time.
[01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:30.630]  I think you did it right, because I wrote it down properly.
[01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:31.470]  Okay, cool.
[01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:33.310]  Pure Med Slab.
[01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:34.150]  Okay, cool.
[01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:36.190]  Or it could be Pure Med Slab, whichever.
[01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:38.830]  Either way, I interpreted slabs, but you know, hey.
[01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:39.670]  Yeah, slabs.
[01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:40.710]  Either way.
[01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:41.910]  Yeah, they have everything.
[01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:43.630]  They're coming out with, you know,
[01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:47.310]  everything from CBD coffee to thousand milligram tinctures.
[01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:49.710]  So, you know, you can get a wide variety
[01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:51.350]  of what you might need.
[01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:52.750]  And you know, like I said, dude,
[01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:54.790]  I'm not in it to just sit there and tell you
[01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:56.750]  that my product's gonna be the best or whatever.
[01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:59.310]  I don't actively put out products like that,
[01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:03.470]  but I can tell you there are a slew of companies
[01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:06.230]  that are legitimate, you know, that do.
[01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:07.750]  CBD International is another one.
[01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:10.030]  I personally do not, you know,
[01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:11.310]  I have nothing against them or anything.
[01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:14.110]  I just, you know, I know they're legitimate.
[01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:16.390]  They're out of California as well.
[01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:19.190]  Cannabinoids Heal is their Instagram handle.
[01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:22.670]  CBD Health Solutions is another one.
[01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:25.550]  They are a wholesaler, which also deal in
[01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:29.790]  can of drop tinctures and you know, whatnot.
[01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:32.550]  And yeah, like we can go on and on.
[01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:35.070]  I shop at a health food store in Colorado Springs
[01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:36.870]  and in their window, they have a sign
[01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:38.910]  that they sell CBD drops, of course,
[01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:40.150]  from the Stanley Brothers.
[01:11:40.150 --> 01:11:41.790]  Unfortunately, yeah.
[01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:43.870]  Is that product worth a shit in your opinion?
[01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:44.950]  Absolutely not.
[01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:48.230]  You know, actually I'll tell you what,
[01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:49.830]  I'm gonna go and pick some up
[01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:51.990]  and then I'm gonna have it tested through my friend Nate
[01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:53.710]  and then we should do another podcast.
[01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:54.630]  I'm all about that.
[01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:57.470]  If you want me to help you pay for the cost of that bottle
[01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:58.750]  to do it on the podcast.
[01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:59.590]  Oh, no, yeah, for sure.
[01:11:59.590 --> 01:12:00.630]  The cost of the testing.
[01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:01.470]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:04.030]  I'm sure Nate would love to do it for me.
[01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:05.430]  We'll definitely give him a shout out on the show.
[01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:06.270]  Oh, of course.
[01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:07.150]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:11.230]  But yeah, I think that they're the biggest charlatans of all.
[01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:13.510]  So you definitely have to be careful.
[01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:17.030]  Just, you know, a little bit of research goes a long way.
[01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:20.670]  You can also look into Halo Labs out of Arizona.
[01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:23.270]  They are big wholesalers as well.
[01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:25.630]  And they, you know, work with other companies
[01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:27.110]  to completely reban products
[01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:29.350]  under what they do at their lab in Arizona.
[01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:34.070]  So yeah, and like I said, I'm completely an open source.
[01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:35.630]  You know, Jeff can, you know,
[01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:38.030]  provide all that information for this show.
[01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:40.670]  And you know, all this stuff will be in the show links,
[01:12:40.670 --> 01:12:42.230]  show notes so that you guys can have links to it
[01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:43.150]  on the Instagram.
[01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:45.190]  First, oh, go ahead.
[01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:47.470]  No, yeah, and it's good for you to be cautious, you know,
[01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:49.270]  and I'm sorry that you have to feel that way,
[01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:51.190]  but I promise you there are companies out there
[01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:54.670]  that are, you know, legitimately, you know,
[01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:57.750]  pursuing the hemp products for what they truly are
[01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:00.870]  and not just trying to make a quick buck on, you know,
[01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:05.150]  you know, the unfortunate situation of our loved ones.
[01:13:05.150 --> 01:13:07.590]  Also check out King Cola on Instagram
[01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:10.150]  and Sansol CBD in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:11.110]  Yes.
[01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:13.750]  I definitely support their CBD project.
[01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:15.470]  They may be able to give you information.
[01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:17.870]  You may be able to acquire a product from them.
[01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:19.030]  I can't tell you what they can do.
[01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:20.070]  I'm just recommending them.
[01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.910]  I know they're-
[01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:21.750]  They're very knowledgeable.
[01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:22.750]  Good hearted folks.
[01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:23.590]  Absolutely.
[01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:25.030]  Great folks.
[01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:26.230]  Something I should mention,
[01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:29.670]  if you're going to consume cannabis for your Parkinson's,
[01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:32.430]  don't only focus on the CBD for the healing.
[01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:34.710]  I would recommend something, a light sativa,
[01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:37.030]  like a jelly bean or a tangy,
[01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:39.750]  because you need, I think the sativa,
[01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:42.590]  the THC and the sativa is good to help treatment.
[01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:43.710]  But at the same time,
[01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:46.350]  that's going to put you, the patient, in a better mood.
[01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:48.430]  It's going to uplift your spirits a little bit.
[01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:49.750]  It's going to make you a little more social.
[01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:51.510]  It's going to put a smile on your face.
[01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:53.070]  And that's a huge part of healing people,
[01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:55.390]  is keeping them happy and keeping a smile on their face.
[01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:56.230]  Absolutely.
[01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:57.390]  Your mood is everything,
[01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:59.870]  especially in recovery or in healing.
[01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:03.670]  So strains that have, you know,
[01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:07.030]  known properties of uplifting, you know, mood and,
[01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:10.110]  you know, anti-anxiety.
[01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:10.950]  Jelly bean.
[01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:13.750]  Space queen for me, dairy queen.
[01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.550]  A lot of the queens kind of do that.
[01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:16.990]  I don't find them as racy.
[01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:19.710]  I find them as smooth, creamy, relaxing.
[01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:20.550]  All right.
[01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:21.870]  Vortex on the other hand.
[01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:23.350]  Oh no, yeah, that's a-
[01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:24.750]  Vortex used to fuck me up.
[01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:26.070]  Yeah, that's like a-
[01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.910]  Same breeder though.
[01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:27.950]  It's all TGA subculture.
[01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:28.870]  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:31.310]  And they have a wide variety of things
[01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:32.750]  in that line of stuff.
[01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:34.590]  So I think that's awesome that things like that
[01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:35.430]  are available.
[01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:36.270]  And you're right, you know,
[01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:38.670]  not to just focus on the CBD only side of things.
[01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:39.510]  Flow.
[01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:42.710]  Colorado flow is a very uplifting smiling morning bud.
[01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:44.110]  Absolutely.
[01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:45.190]  DJ Short's blueberry.
[01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:48.390]  I mean, it's not the most knock you down strain,
[01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:50.550]  but the smoke is incredibly enjoyable.
[01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:51.990]  Very medicinal as well.
[01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:53.630]  It'll have, it could have good CBD
[01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:55.670]  and a very good head aroma or a head high to it
[01:14:55.670 --> 01:14:57.030]  and a nice blueberry aroma.
[01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.870]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:58.710]  Yeah.
[01:14:58.710 --> 01:14:59.550]  Shout out to DJ Short.
[01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:00.870]  He's been breeding for longer than most of us
[01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:02.470]  have even been thinking about cannabis.
[01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:03.310]  Yes.
[01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:05.510]  Or had any inclination of wanting to work with it.
[01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:06.350]  True breeder.
[01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:07.190]  True, true breeder.
[01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:08.030]  Definitely.
[01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.870]  All right.
[01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:10.590]  You mentioned tincture.
[01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:11.910]  Yeah.
[01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:13.790]  We were talking about tincture and dosage
[01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:15.030]  on another episode.
[01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:19.830]  What do you recommend for dosage on a tincture?
[01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:24.830]  Say somebody has cancer or maybe I don't even want to
[01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:27.350]  diagnose anybody with another condition,
[01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:29.150]  but a sick person.
[01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:29.990]  We'll just go with cancer.
[01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.830]  It sounds decent.
[01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:31.670]  Yeah, let's go with cancer.
[01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:33.270]  Because it would be different, you know,
[01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:36.030]  if it's more focused on a neurological condition
[01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:37.790]  and it's a higher dose of CBD.
[01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:40.550]  And if it's THC only or whether they're getting Delta-9
[01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:43.590]  or all factors in how it's going to go.
[01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:46.030]  So cancer, we're going to go the other way around.
[01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:52.390]  Obviously, treatment that with guidelines that we followed
[01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:53.870]  is through, you know, Rick Simpson,
[01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:57.550]  though I don't use his extraction methods of, you know,
[01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:59.430]  gram a day for 90 days.
[01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:06.830]  And doing that, you know, when I say that THC high oil,
[01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:09.870]  and when I say a gram a day,
[01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:12.190]  it's really more like a thousand milligrams a day.
[01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:17.190]  And obviously, you know, a gram isn't a thousand milligrams.
[01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:20.710]  So that's something that we, you know,
[01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:22.070]  not enough gets focused on.
[01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:24.270]  So in the short of it, let's not say a gram a day,
[01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:26.830]  let's say a thousand milligrams a day for 90 days.
[01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:30.550]  That's going to make people feel like shit also.
[01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:31.390]  Yeah.
[01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:36.510]  They usually, you know, the way you would start, you know,
[01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:38.350]  because people have been consuming this oil raw
[01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:41.590]  for so long, they would start with like little pea-sized
[01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:44.030]  bits and that would fuck them up.
[01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:47.790]  And they'd kind of work their way up, you know,
[01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:51.950]  trying to work with different extraction methods
[01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:55.230]  and non-solvent techniques and trying to, you know,
[01:16:55.230 --> 01:16:58.630]  gain the same uptake, you know, in the amount,
[01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:03.470]  but not feeling so sluggish or more importantly,
[01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:07.590]  some of our bodies can't process that oil
[01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:09.670]  the way that we should, unfortunately.
[01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:12.470]  And it's better left as a topical for melanoma.
[01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:15.750]  So at that point, if our bodies can't process it,
[01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:18.990]  or if, you know, if we have compromised digestive problems,
[01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:21.070]  you know, whether it be Crohn's, colitis,
[01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:23.150]  whatever the case is, throw that shit out the door.
[01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:26.630]  You need something that isn't going to harm your gut,
[01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:31.630]  you know, because of how the extraction method
[01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:34.950]  leaves it a little, it's a little harsh, you know?
[01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:35.790]  Right, yeah.
[01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:36.630]  It's a little sludgy.
[01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:37.450]  Yeah, it's sludgy.
[01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:38.830]  There's a little burn to it,
[01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:40.470]  regardless of how clean it is.
[01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:42.830]  A lot of people aren't using grape ethanol.
[01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:44.430]  Most people are using Everclear
[01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:46.310]  because that's what's available to them.
[01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:48.230]  So there's a lot of those things that come into account,
[01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:52.590]  you know, so we try not to deal with that at all.
[01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:54.230]  You know, you've seen me,
[01:17:54.230 --> 01:17:56.590]  I'm focusing more on the non-solvent part of that
[01:17:56.590 --> 01:18:00.070]  and trying to focus and, you know, de-winterize rosin
[01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:01.710]  and start doing things of that sort
[01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:06.630]  and seeing what we can do without having to use alcohol
[01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:08.310]  or butane or solvents.
[01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:11.030]  Yeah, you know, and keep it organic.
[01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:15.590]  A friend of ours is starting a vineyard, you know,
[01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:19.590]  with some grapes and we're going to be doing a little,
[01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:21.110]  you know, a little project.
[01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:23.990]  We'll be making our own grape ethanol.
[01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:28.070]  Yeah, so, you know, we're trying to make this all in,
[01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:30.030]  you know, Pueblo nonetheless.
[01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:34.350]  So it's all Colorado organic at the end of the day.
[01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:36.310]  So the people that talk crap about Pueblo,
[01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:37.510]  we're doing some things here, you guys.
[01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:38.550]  Oh yeah. We're killing it here.
[01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:40.990]  Oh yeah, I'm super happy to come down and be part of,
[01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:42.710]  you know, there's already a lot of great people,
[01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:45.910]  good caregivers, good breeders doing their things.
[01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:48.350]  So yeah, definitely, Pueblo's killing it.
[01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:51.910]  So for cancer, you'd basically recommend 1,000 milligrams
[01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:55.390]  of THC per day to try to fight the cancer
[01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:57.430]  and you do that for at least 90 days?
[01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:59.710]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I know that sounds intense.
[01:18:59.710 --> 01:19:02.390]  And so I'll say this, you know,
[01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:04.630]  if it's for our loved ones or whatever the case is,
[01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:09.630]  taking it via suppository will bypass that feeling
[01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:13.310]  of you eating, you know, a gram plus a day.
[01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:16.030]  Our bodies will still take it and absorb it
[01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:20.350]  and we'll get all the cancer killing qualities of the THC
[01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:24.390]  without that effect of it going through our digestive system
[01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:26.150]  and then into our bloodstream, you know?
[01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:27.550]  You'll probably get more of it.
[01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:30.950]  Yeah, and you would get it absorbed quicker, you know,
[01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:34.070]  without, it's pretty amazing how that works, you know?
[01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:36.030]  And we're not talking about just putting some hash
[01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:37.670]  or buds in your butt, you guys.
[01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:38.790]  No, absolutely not.
[01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:41.150]  It's gotta be activated, it's probably some hash oil
[01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:43.110]  with some coconut oil inside of a pill.
[01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:45.830]  Yeah, a special pill and then you have to obviously know
[01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:48.870]  where you're placing it so that it goes into your tract
[01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:52.110]  and so on and so forth and I don't wanna get too specific,
[01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:54.790]  but you know, if you guys are curious about that,
[01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:57.030]  again, you know, ask me.
[01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:58.630]  I'm more than happy to go into that.
[01:19:58.630 --> 01:20:02.590]  If you wanna do an episode on gastrointestinal,
[01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:05.350]  you know, side effects and things with CBD,
[01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:06.870]  we can totally do that, but.
[01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:10.310]  This guy lives like 15 minutes away from me now, you guys,
[01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:11.910]  so he will be on the show a lot.
[01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:13.790]  Send me all of your CBD questions.
[01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:14.710]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:18.150]  I'm more than happy to, you know, help in any way I can.
[01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:21.230]  But yeah, at least a thousand milligrams a day.
[01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:24.150]  Obviously, a lot of people don't have that advantage
[01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:27.710]  of knowing someone who can make the suppositories.
[01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:29.670]  Maybe that's something I can work on in the future
[01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:32.670]  and try to just, you know, create, you know,
[01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:34.470]  put something out there as a little, you know,
[01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:36.590]  formula for people to follow.
[01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:40.670]  But in the meanwhile, if you can find,
[01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:42.950]  on the same level, there are people who make
[01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:45.590]  10,000 milligram tinctures where every dropper
[01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:48.390]  is like 400 milligrams, you know?
[01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:50.630]  If you happen to be in Colorado or a medical state,
[01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:52.270]  it's gonna be much easier to find these.
[01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:57.270]  If not, again, you know, trying to find the material
[01:20:57.990 --> 01:21:02.990]  and create that, you know, that medicine is essential.
[01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:06.670]  You know, you're gonna have to basically
[01:21:06.670 --> 01:21:09.270]  get your math right and it's just so difficult.
[01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:11.510]  It breaks my heart just speaking, you know,
[01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:14.030]  about that to other people, knowing that they're in states
[01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:16.070]  where they can't get their oil tested,
[01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:19.510]  so they can't get the math right on what the dosage
[01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:20.350]  really is.
[01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:23.870]  And so there's a guessing game of if they're lucky enough
[01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:26.270]  to have the material to make the oil the way that they need
[01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:28.230]  to, how the fuck are they gonna dose it?
[01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:30.910]  Or how the fuck are they gonna accurately, like,
[01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:35.190]  it just upsets me, you know, for them as patients.
[01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:39.750]  But nevertheless, you know, where there's the will,
[01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:40.830]  there's a way, you know?
[01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:43.510]  And lives are more important than laws, in my opinion.
[01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:46.190]  Hashtag lives over laws.
[01:21:46.190 --> 01:21:47.190]  Yep.
[01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:50.750]  So people, you know, people listening that are, you know,
[01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:55.030]  curious about that, you know, I don't support anything
[01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:58.430]  that would ever jeopardize your freedom,
[01:21:58.430 --> 01:22:02.310]  but if you're trying to help someone you love,
[01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:05.190]  then I will happily share whatever information I can,
[01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:06.030]  you know?
[01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:06.870]  Fox is here to teach.
[01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:09.070]  He will sit down with each and every one of you
[01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:11.830]  and teach you what he knows, if that's what's needed.
[01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:12.670]  Pretty much.
[01:22:12.670 --> 01:22:15.230]  So we talked about somebody with cancer.
[01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:16.910]  What about if you've just got, like,
[01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:18.430]  I've got some knee inflammation.
[01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:19.270]  I work hard.
[01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:20.110]  My body, you know, I'm a puss.
[01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.950]  I got some knee pain.
[01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:22.190]  You're kind of a tall dude, you know?
[01:22:22.190 --> 01:22:23.750]  You put it on your joints.
[01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:25.390]  I get the lower back pain and the knee pain
[01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:26.670]  going on at this age.
[01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:28.910]  What would you recommend, tincture-wise,
[01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:30.470]  for a guy in my condition?
[01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:34.870]  Honestly, like, one-to-ones are the way to get,
[01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:36.870]  like, one-to-ones for when you get off of work
[01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:40.830]  and some high CBD, low THC, you know,
[01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:42.870]  if you need to take it throughout the day, you know?
[01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:46.390]  It'll prevent any inflammation
[01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:47.710]  if it's towards the end of the day.
[01:22:47.710 --> 01:22:50.230]  It'll help bring any down that you have.
[01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:53.950]  It'll help relax your muscles.
[01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:55.230]  So if you're stiff, you know,
[01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:58.590]  you won't have that stiffness.
[01:22:58.590 --> 01:23:01.150]  I think CBD is a great way to start it in the morning,
[01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:02.510]  especially.
[01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:04.990]  Do you juice or do you, you know, are you-
[01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:07.510]  I eat like crap lately, to be honest, Cruz.
[01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:09.070]  I'm a vegetarian that eats like crap.
[01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:10.190]  No, it's okay.
[01:23:10.190 --> 01:23:11.030]  It's all right.
[01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:13.070]  You're my favorite vegetarian.
[01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:15.070]  I'm not sure what that means, but okay.
[01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:17.430]  I'm not vegan, dude.
[01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:18.270]  I'm not that guy.
[01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:19.110]  Exactly.
[01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.950]  I'm not the vegan guy.
[01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:21.590]  That's, yeah, see, that's good.
[01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.910]  But yeah.
[01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:28.230]  Shoot, I totally forgot what I was gonna say.
[01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:29.070]  That's all right.
[01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.230]  I can reroute us.
[01:23:30.230 --> 01:23:33.270]  Do you recommend utilizing Reclaim
[01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:34.990]  in tincture or edible form?
[01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:36.910]  Okay, so yeah, let's be honest.
[01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:40.070]  You know, if you, I would suggest if you're, you know,
[01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:41.790]  medicating or whatever,
[01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:44.030]  dropdowns are essential for collecting Reclaim
[01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:47.070]  because you don't want to collect some Reclaim
[01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:49.150]  that's had water through it and have to,
[01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:50.550]  and it's just a whole process.
[01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:51.510]  You don't want that humidity.
[01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:53.790]  But anyways, yes.
[01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:55.070]  It's been proven that, you know,
[01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:58.950]  I've seen Reclaim tests high as 63%, you know, THC.
[01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:00.590]  So, and that's activated oil.
[01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:02.630]  So, I mean, it's not fully activated,
[01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:05.190]  but at that point, it pretty, you know,
[01:24:05.190 --> 01:24:08.190]  recollecting it and putting into a container
[01:24:08.190 --> 01:24:11.470]  and then, you know, activating it for a bit longer
[01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:13.590]  will really, I mean, it creates, it's great food grade,
[01:24:14.150 --> 01:24:15.790]  you know, clean it up properly,
[01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:18.550]  make sure all the moisture's out of it, you know,
[01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:22.430]  add your oil carrier, you know, your fat carrier,
[01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:23.790]  whatever you want to call it.
[01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:26.390]  And you're good to go on your edibles, you know,
[01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:27.950]  or your capsules for that matter.
[01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:29.350]  You keep talking about activating.
[01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:32.590]  Can you teach us about decarboxylation and activation?
[01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:35.670]  Okay, so decarboxylation, decarbing your oil.
[01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:40.350]  So, depending on whether you're going for CBD,
[01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:41.510]  damn man, it's going to be a piss.
[01:24:41.670 --> 01:24:43.710]  I just had this convo with her like a month ago.
[01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:44.550]  All right.
[01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:50.070]  So, when you're decarbing for certain oils,
[01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:52.830]  you can decarb for a more sedative oil, you know,
[01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:57.550]  like you can convert CBD or THC oil into CBN.
[01:24:57.550 --> 01:25:00.230]  And it's just like, it's beyond sedative.
[01:25:00.230 --> 01:25:02.350]  I mean, it's beyond Indica Plus, you know?
[01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:04.230]  So, it's like sleepy time for sure.
[01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:05.070]  Okay.
[01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:09.510]  Like sleepy time, T times two, you know, which is great.
[01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:12.710]  Or, you know, you can do shorter decarb times
[01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:16.750]  at different temperatures to stay within that,
[01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:18.670]  not break that acid barrier.
[01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:21.470]  So, when you decarboxylate something,
[01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:25.350]  there's an oil decarboxylic acid,
[01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:28.070]  which accounts for a certain percentage.
[01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:30.630]  So, when you do that, you're going to obtain a loss.
[01:25:30.630 --> 01:25:33.030]  It's like minuscule, you're not going to notice it,
[01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:34.470]  but you need to know, like, you know,
[01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:38.150]  when you see the bubbles coming up out of your oil and stuff,
[01:25:38.150 --> 01:25:42.390]  that's decarboxylic acid, you know, coming up and, you know,
[01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:45.950]  leaving, you know, the oil so that you, you know,
[01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:50.950]  a lot of people assume that it's a solvent or something,
[01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:52.150]  you know, whatever it is.
[01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:54.430]  But if you're starting with a clean oil, that's not the case.
[01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:56.190]  If you've already dabbed it, there's no solvent left.
[01:25:56.190 --> 01:25:57.150]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:57.150 --> 01:26:00.470]  Or, you know, depending on the situation.
[01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:03.830]  And then I'm actually going to start decarboxylating
[01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:05.030]  all the solventless stuff.
[01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:06.950]  So, I've never really done a lot of that
[01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:10.150]  because I've, you know, focused on butane extractions mostly
[01:26:10.150 --> 01:26:11.550]  or isolate concentrates.
[01:26:11.550 --> 01:26:13.950]  So, it'll be interesting to see.
[01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:17.550]  I don't think it should be too different with the rosin, but yeah.
[01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:21.030]  Wouldn't you think the rosin is kind of already activated a little
[01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:22.550]  since it's been through so much heat?
[01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:23.390]  See, that's the thing.
[01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:27.790]  I'm taking, you know, half grams from all these different presses
[01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:29.470]  and I want to get them tested for that reason.
[01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:32.750]  But from what I've seen, even from like soil grown stuff
[01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:37.070]  and other people, I haven't seen, it's not fully activated.
[01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:41.270]  Even the chips come in at like, like that, the Reclaim,
[01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:44.830]  the rosin chips are coming in at like 30 to 50%.
[01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:48.830]  You know, you can do an iso soak or even better.
[01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:51.390]  What I would do personally, if you guys do the rosin,
[01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:55.190]  you guys are big collectors, is do canna butter with your rosin chips.
[01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:55.510]  Wow.
[01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:58.590]  You know, because that's, you're going to, you can break it all down
[01:26:58.590 --> 01:27:02.630]  almost like a mulch and just, you know, double up on your cheesecloth
[01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:05.910]  when you're filtering, you know, if you're OCD like me
[01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:09.510]  and it'll make some great butter for edibles, like hands down,
[01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:12.030]  you know, some real good body high.
[01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:12.910]  Use it all.
[01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:13.710]  No, absolutely.
[01:27:13.710 --> 01:27:20.270]  I'm a total fan of, and advocate of using the whole plant.
[01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:23.550]  That's why we're actually growing some of them with just water,
[01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:27.830]  straight water, no needs, so that we can juice those,
[01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:30.270]  those couple of plants, you know, and then we can say like,
[01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:31.670]  no animal byproduct, nothing.
[01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:31.950]  Yeah.
[01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:32.910]  Don't spray them with anything.
[01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:33.230]  Nothing.
[01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:34.350]  Just straight RO bro.
[01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.670]  Yeah.
[01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:37.270]  Now, so, um, we're excited about that.
[01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:43.870]  Um, I'm going to pull something up so that we can get a little
[01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:45.870]  specific with the decarboxylation.
[01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:46.430]  I like it.
[01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:48.510]  We're going to learn a whole bunch of stuff here, guys.
[01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:49.550]  Be patient while he searches.
[01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:51.870]  He's got a little bit of information to pull up for us.
[01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:53.590]  So you guys can use your reclaim.
[01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:54.990]  And he mentioned using a dropdown.
[01:27:55.390 --> 01:27:58.630]  Um, we often forget that some of our friends are not dabbers and they
[01:27:58.630 --> 01:28:01.150]  don't dab daily and they might be in other States where the toilets flush
[01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:02.790]  the wrong way and the weed grows upside down.
[01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:05.190]  Um, yeah.
[01:28:05.190 --> 01:28:07.870]  Our Australian friends, I might've said States too, and he's in another country.
[01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:08.630]  That's not a state.
[01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:10.950]  Um, I found out Australia had States.
[01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:14.310]  Like I stupidly thought it was just Australia and all of Australia.
[01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:17.510]  And there's like no parts of Sydney and Melbourne.
[01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:19.470]  That's just the dumb of other places.
[01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:19.950]  No.
[01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:23.870]  So, um, a dropdown, you guys, a dropdown will go on your, normally
[01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:25.150]  where the nail would go.
[01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:26.510]  You put a dropdown in there.
[01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:30.230]  It's a piece of glass that, uh, comes out where the nail would go.
[01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:33.910]  And it angles down and then it angles back up to where your
[01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:35.550]  nail or your email could go on it.
[01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:38.310]  And it just puts the nail a couple of inches away from your face.
[01:28:38.710 --> 01:28:41.830]  And it also makes a nice place to catch the reclaim oil so that it
[01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:43.430]  doesn't end up in your rig water.
[01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:46.390]  So that's what a dropdown is when he was talking about a dropdown earlier.
[01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:49.110]  Um, shout out to my friend, Rasta seven, Australia.
[01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:50.430]  Uh, thanks for the support.
[01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:52.750]  It was good seeing you on Facebook live.
[01:28:53.710 --> 01:28:56.190]  Fox is diligently searching for this information here.
[01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.590]  Okay.
[01:28:57.590 --> 01:29:02.230]  So we're going to talk, uh, TAT first.
[01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:09.590]  So boiling point for TAT would be 315 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:11.390]  And that's what that, that would start to boil off.
[01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:11.870]  Okay.
[01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:14.470]  So that's when it starts to convert.
[01:29:14.670 --> 01:29:15.310]  Yes.
[01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:21.230]  And that will convert it to if there's any CBD to convert to,
[01:29:21.230 --> 01:29:22.310]  that's what it would convert.
[01:29:22.670 --> 01:29:24.190]  But let's go back to the TAT.
[01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:30.550]  So you would want to be between 290 and 310 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.070]  Two 90 and three 10.
[01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:33.590]  Yeah.
[01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:37.990]  Because that's between the CBC a and THC barrier.
[01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:43.870]  Um, CBC is another, uh, compound we can, that's a whole
[01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:46.190]  another three hour conversation, but we can get into that.
[01:29:46.190 --> 01:29:47.070]  So we'll have that one.
[01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:47.830]  Yeah, no, totally.
[01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:48.590]  That's fun.
[01:29:48.710 --> 01:29:51.790]  Let's let's just talk, talk for me, but anyways, getting back to that.
[01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:56.950]  So that will activate your Delta nine, which is obviously your body.
[01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:57.310]  We'll do it.
[01:29:57.390 --> 01:30:01.310]  It's also an anti-inflammatory appetite, stimulant, anti-emetic,
[01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:05.830]  anti-proliferate and antioxidant on top of, you know, all the wonderful
[01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:07.790]  things that it does with, uh, cancer.
[01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:17.670]  Um, that being said, um, depending on how long you go on the D carb, you can over,
[01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:19.630]  you know, you can burn your oil.
[01:30:19.630 --> 01:30:21.550]  So you have to be careful of that.
[01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:27.910]  Uh, you know, going for the longer D carbs, but, um, I have decarbed oils for,
[01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:32.230]  you know, three hours, six hours, uh, eight hours, just to see, just to get
[01:30:32.230 --> 01:30:37.430]  to see where the set of effect comes out, where the burnout, you know, where
[01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:39.470]  do I, where am I burning things out?
[01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:40.070]  You know?
[01:30:40.150 --> 01:30:46.750]  Um, and I, you know, you can decarb the oil for, let's say 90 minutes, you know?
[01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:51.350]  And, but honestly, I would say 180 minutes is, you know, a good starting point.
[01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:57.110]  I really like to look at it every, every, uh, shit, every 45 to 60
[01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:58.470]  minutes to see how it's doing.
[01:30:58.510 --> 01:31:01.750]  You know, cause every oil that you start with is different.
[01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:03.390]  It's not going to be my oil you're using.
[01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:04.670]  I'm not going to be using your oil.
[01:31:04.670 --> 01:31:10.150]  So I'll tell you these, you know, times and mindsets, but just keep in mind
[01:31:10.150 --> 01:31:11.350]  and keep an eye on everything.
[01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:16.310]  And once all the decarboxylic acid, I hope I'm saying that right.
[01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.590]  Sorry.
[01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:21.710]  From that little medicated, um, you know, uh, comes out of the oil and what
[01:31:21.710 --> 01:31:27.630]  you're left with, uh, is, you know, this decarbed goodness that is fully
[01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:31.230]  activated, you know, and depending on what temperature points that you're
[01:31:31.230 --> 01:31:36.190]  hitting, you're either activating for CBD, you're activating for terpene
[01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:41.150]  rich activated oil, um, it all depends.
[01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:43.950]  You know, it's like, you can just play around with your temperatures and have
[01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:46.350]  a completely different product depending on what you do.
[01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:47.470]  How is one?
[01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:51.150]  So if I had some reclaim, if I had my dropdown, I had some reclaim and I
[01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:52.510]  collected a substantial amount.
[01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:55.310]  Now I want to activate it to decarbonate.
[01:31:55.870 --> 01:31:57.430]  Uh, and I want to get it to this temperature.
[01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:58.150]  How do I do that?
[01:31:58.150 --> 01:32:01.590]  Do I just put it in a Pyrex dish and maybe throw it in the oven?
[01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:04.510]  Is there a tech to this or is it something you want to share?
[01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:05.270]  Uh, okay.
[01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:06.470]  To make it really easy.
[01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:09.910]  Uh, and just like, you can call it low tech or whatever.
[01:32:10.190 --> 01:32:14.910]  So get yourself to target or Walmart or whatever you're, you know, I don't
[01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:19.390]  care who you go to, but any place that sells Pyrex and try to find the small,
[01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:24.910]  like shit, I don't even know what kind of little bowl it is like a little.
[01:32:26.230 --> 01:32:30.270]  Pyrex, um, like a little salsa bowl.
[01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.750]  Yeah.
[01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:31.110]  Yeah.
[01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:32.790]  Like, like, like a little peppered chef.
[01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:33.710]  A little, yeah, exactly.
[01:32:33.710 --> 01:32:36.150]  You know, they'll, they'll sell them in a few different sizes.
[01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:39.390]  Try to get a small one if you can, cause you know, it's just make it easier.
[01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:46.670]  And then you can take your drop down when it's full or gunked up and take a torch to
[01:32:46.670 --> 01:32:46.870]  it.
[01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:52.070]  And when I mean that very, you know, gently just torch it a little bit until
[01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:53.270]  you can see the oil moving.
[01:32:54.630 --> 01:32:55.070]  Excuse me.
[01:32:55.230 --> 01:33:00.630]  And then, uh, you, you can pour all the oil into the little ramekin cup or
[01:33:00.630 --> 01:33:01.110]  whatever you want.
[01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:02.670]  So that's the word we were looking for.
[01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:03.190]  I think so.
[01:33:03.190 --> 01:33:03.390]  Yeah.
[01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:04.990]  The rent, the, the Pyrex ramekin.
[01:33:05.630 --> 01:33:10.790]  And, uh, yeah, after that, you know, after you've got that all poured in, you know, be
[01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:15.670]  very careful not to, you know, crack your drop down, you know, um, there's easier ways
[01:33:15.670 --> 01:33:15.990]  to do it.
[01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:21.910]  You can put the job down in the oven and, uh, let it get, you know, warm and poured
[01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:23.950]  out or whatever, but it's still try this at home.
[01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.430]  Yeah.
[01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:24.710]  Yeah.
[01:33:24.710 --> 01:33:28.350]  This, this way just kind of works a little bit easier, you know, just taking a light
[01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:30.550]  little flame to it, watching the oil move.
[01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:31.070]  It'll all.
[01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:34.470]  Dump out and then you can start getting to work on that.
[01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:40.270]  Um, yeah, after you decarbed it, you can, you know, add your carrot oil.
[01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:44.670]  I always like to, so once we've got it into the Petri or the, uh, the, the ramekin.
[01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:45.030]  Yeah.
[01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:45.990]  Now what do we do with it?
[01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:47.030]  Um, okay.
[01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:48.110]  Now you've got it in there.
[01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:51.510]  You set your temperature depending on what you need.
[01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:55.910]  You can actually, if you guys want to learn something, you can Google, uh,
[01:33:55.950 --> 01:34:01.510]  cannabis activation chart and, uh, you'll see a bunch of different pictures and
[01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:06.150]  graphs, and it'll kind of give you an idea of, you know, where you want to go.
[01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:08.870]  Most people, like I said, are just activating, you know, for the THC and
[01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:09.390]  that's great.
[01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:16.030]  So, uh, you know, like I said, so let's say an even 300, 180 minutes, you know,
[01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.830]  just pop it in the oven.
[01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:17.390]  Yeah.
[01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:18.230]  Pop it in the oven.
[01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:20.590]  Uh, let's do its thing.
[01:34:20.630 --> 01:34:24.790]  Um, some people like to add the carrier oil before they decarb it.
[01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:30.270]  Um, I like to decarb the oil completely and then add my carrier oil to it.
[01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:34.150]  You know, whether it's going to be avocado, coconut, grapeseed, uh,
[01:34:34.190 --> 01:34:35.390]  blanch, you know, whatever.
[01:34:36.190 --> 01:34:38.310]  Grapeseed oil, sunflower seed oil, whatever.
[01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:42.550]  There's a bunch like each depending on the patient, whatever the hell they're
[01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:45.230]  allergic to, you'd be like, all right, there's, there's something thankfully
[01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:48.150]  guaranteed a fat that your body can take.
[01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:48.630]  Yeah.
[01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:53.590]  So needless to say, you know, there's ways around whatever, but yeah.
[01:34:53.630 --> 01:34:58.430]  Um, so you put it in the oven, you know, you set your time, you check on it.
[01:34:58.510 --> 01:35:05.230]  Uh, once it's ready, you know, you, uh, add, oh, and let's back up a little bit
[01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:10.950]  before you put it in the oven, weigh it out, know how much that you're working
[01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:12.590]  with that makes it super easy.
[01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:16.830]  So you're working with seven grams or three grams or whatever.
[01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:19.110]  You know how much coconut oil you're going to put in.
[01:35:19.110 --> 01:35:20.310]  You want to weigh that out too.
[01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:21.990]  That will make it a lot easier.
[01:35:22.230 --> 01:35:22.630]  Okay.
[01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:25.710]  Have a weight specific ratio that you can work with.
[01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:30.630]  Um, sometimes I go really low, you know, like one gram to seven grams, you know,
[01:35:30.630 --> 01:35:36.990]  and, or, or less, you know, just to kind of get it to this wonderful, you know,
[01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:42.590]  all for consistency, depending on what we're doing, you know, um, that being
[01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:47.950]  said, uh, once that's added, once, once you have your numbers and everything's
[01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:52.470]  weighed, do everything we talked about, set it, set it in your Petri dish or your
[01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:59.390]  ramekin cup, put it in the oven, do carbon for X amount of time, add your oil, make
[01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:04.070]  sure that, you know, it's, it's bonded that the side separated, you can put it
[01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:05.550]  back in the oven for just a little while.
[01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:10.830]  Um, and then, you know, follow the recipe of what to whatever you're trying to do.
[01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:11.750]  Capsules.
[01:36:12.150 --> 01:36:15.590]  Uh, if you're trying to, you know, keep the oil, you can pull it in a syringe,
[01:36:15.630 --> 01:36:19.910]  you know, and, and keep it, you know, keep it ready for until you need it or,
[01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:20.870]  you know, whatever you're trying to do.
[01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.390]  Nice.
[01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:23.950]  Those syringes are sketchy looking.
[01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:24.630]  Yeah.
[01:36:24.630 --> 01:36:24.870]  Yeah.
[01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:26.030]  I'm not, I'm not a fan of them.
[01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.310]  Yeah.
[01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.590]  Yeah.
[01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:29.350]  But sometimes that's the best way that you can apply it to whatever you're doing.
[01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.750]  Yeah.
[01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:33.590]  Or, you know, the best way to collect it in, excuse me, in large amounts.
[01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:36.190]  You are a wealth of CBD knowledge, my friend.
[01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.990]  Yeah.
[01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:39.350]  People don't, I guess.
[01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:41.150]  So I love it.
[01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:43.430]  I love that somebody I'm a weed nerd.
[01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:44.510]  I love growing cannabis.
[01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:47.470]  I love knowing about breeding and strains and strain selection.
[01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:48.470]  I love that stuff.
[01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:52.390]  I love that somebody is focused in on the cannabinoids and the making specific
[01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:53.230]  products for people.
[01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:54.230]  That's really rad.
[01:36:54.230 --> 01:36:55.030]  I commend you for that.
[01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:56.510]  Uh, that's a fat dab.
[01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:57.790]  I'm kind of jealous right now.
[01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:59.430]  So we've been going for just about an hour.
[01:36:59.430 --> 01:37:00.670]  I'm going to ask you one more question.
[01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:02.910]  Uh, and then we're going to have to wrap up this show for the night.
[01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:04.510]  It's almost midnight here in Colorado.
[01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:05.030]  Uh, no doubt.
[01:37:05.630 --> 01:37:06.870]  Uh, Fox will be back.
[01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:07.710]  You guys, he lives close.
[01:37:07.710 --> 01:37:11.150]  Like I said, we get along real well and he shows up with Terps.
[01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:14.150]  So, uh, he'll be back and he brings this really cool rig.
[01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:16.430]  Uh, so somebody sent me an email.
[01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:17.830]  They, uh, they're pregnant.
[01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:21.390]  They're going to have a baby and they wanted to know how I feel and what
[01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:23.790]  information I had on cannabis and pregnancy.
[01:37:24.110 --> 01:37:28.150]  And honestly, uh, as a stoner dude, I really haven't thought too
[01:37:28.150 --> 01:37:29.430]  much about cannabis and pregnancy.
[01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:31.830]  I don't feel that, uh, that's a lot of my business.
[01:37:32.190 --> 01:37:35.390]  I shouldn't be preaching anything about that, but do you have an opinion on it?
[01:37:35.670 --> 01:37:36.950]  Yeah, I do.
[01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:41.110]  And, uh, first of all, let me start by saying, uh, you know, a woman's
[01:37:41.110 --> 01:37:42.550]  body is her own fucking business.
[01:37:44.710 --> 01:37:45.830]  I'm not one to say shit.
[01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:48.390]  Um, but I'll tell you my experience with it.
[01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:54.030]  So my ex-wife, uh, the mother, my child, um, had a horrible morning sickness.
[01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:57.030]  Like, holy shit, dude, just, she wasn't able to work.
[01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:58.470]  She wasn't able to work at her job.
[01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:59.910]  You know, she was a banker at the time.
[01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:02.630]  Um, it was, it was really affecting her.
[01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:06.030]  What helped, you know, was some cannabis in the morning.
[01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:12.430]  You know, this is, we weren't, this is, this is back way back, uh, eight, nine
[01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:14.430]  years ago, you know, almost 10 years ago.
[01:38:14.710 --> 01:38:19.830]  So people weren't up on the clean oil game the way that we are for the most part, you
[01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:21.270]  know, Miami, whatever the case is.
[01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:23.990]  So you're lucky to get good flour, whatever the case is.
[01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:25.390]  And that's what it was.
[01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:31.470]  So at first it kind of made me interesting to think, you know, how it would affect
[01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:36.830]  our, our child, but seeing, you know, my partner in pain and not being able to
[01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:40.230]  work or literally not being able to stand up straight, cause she would have to run
[01:38:40.230 --> 01:38:44.150]  to the bathroom and throw up cannabis is what helped, you know, like literally just
[01:38:44.150 --> 01:38:47.630]  a single puff or two would hold her over for six to eight hours.
[01:38:47.630 --> 01:38:48.710]  You know, it was awesome.
[01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:51.550]  It was not like a heavy, you know, doses.
[01:38:51.550 --> 01:38:57.470]  The, it was really, even back then it helped me see the medical attributes that
[01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:59.790]  we weren't seeing, you know, beyond getting high.
[01:39:00.190 --> 01:39:07.550]  Um, so my opinion on it is ladies, uh, I, when it comes to the dabbing, you know,
[01:39:07.630 --> 01:39:15.830]  um, I can't say that I approve of anything made with solvents because we've yet to
[01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:19.750]  see these effects on infants.
[01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:23.750]  And I mean, as adults, you know, we, we, we do them and, you know, regardless of
[01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:26.230]  whether it's clean to the state standards.
[01:39:26.230 --> 01:39:28.390]  And I mean, you know, you've seen the live resume.
[01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:32.350]  I mean, we'd love, you know, I love live resin and, you know,
[01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:34.990]  a hundred pound body versus that few ounce fetus.
[01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.390]  Yeah.
[01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:36.710]  It's affected completely differently.
[01:39:37.230 --> 01:39:38.110]  Residual solvent.
[01:39:38.150 --> 01:39:38.870]  Absolutely.
[01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:42.510]  So when it comes to that, you, we can talk dry sift bubble.
[01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:46.710]  And at the same time, you know, unless that bubble hash or the full melts has
[01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:54.270]  been microbially tested or anything like, you know, you have to be beyond anal about
[01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:59.350]  your meds, you know, and I can't stress that enough, you know, so if, if we had
[01:39:59.550 --> 01:40:03.630]  some clean Rostagef grown medicine that, you know, it was clean, it wasn't sprayed
[01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:07.150]  with anything funky, it was grown with love, with organic nutrients, and then I
[01:40:07.150 --> 01:40:11.670]  harvested it and I passed it off to Fox and Fox made some clean, but we'll just
[01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:12.390]  stick with the flower.
[01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.710]  Yeah.
[01:40:12.710 --> 01:40:16.910]  Would then at that point, would you approve of pregnant mom smoking a little
[01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:17.270]  flower?
[01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.830]  Yeah.
[01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:18.750]  Yeah, of course.
[01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:25.190]  And you know, my ex-girlfriend got pregnant and this is after we got
[01:40:25.190 --> 01:40:29.910]  separated and it, it would tear me up because she was a hardcore dabber and I'm
[01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:35.230]  like, but at the same time, she's a medical patient in her own regard to
[01:40:35.230 --> 01:40:38.630]  cancer survivor and she's here again, having her second child.
[01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:39.830]  Who am I to say?
[01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:44.870]  Because I'm not sure, you know, that's the other thing that that, with my
[01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:45.390]  opinion.
[01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:50.990]  So, and she ended up having a beautiful little girl, like just the picture
[01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:54.310]  perfect, you know, picture of a little beautiful child.
[01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:56.710]  And I can't say shit.
[01:40:56.710 --> 01:40:57.830]  So same with my daughter.
[01:40:58.150 --> 01:41:02.870]  I ended up with a gorgeous little girl and I'm super grateful and like nothing.
[01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.510]  Yeah.
[01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:05.150]  My little kid's brightest shit.
[01:41:05.150 --> 01:41:09.590]  You know, I'm, I'm, I'm super blessed to have a little smart ass knucklehead on
[01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:10.070]  my hands.
[01:41:10.110 --> 01:41:12.430]  I've got a smart ass 12 year old daughter as well.
[01:41:12.430 --> 01:41:12.630]  Yeah.
[01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:18.430]  Her mom didn't consume much cannabis during pregnancy because her claim was
[01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:22.550]  that when she inhaled smoke, she's depriving the fetus of oxygen.
[01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:25.710]  So that was why she didn't want to smoke, but she did have a little bit of an
[01:41:25.710 --> 01:41:27.230]  edible if I remember one time.
[01:41:27.390 --> 01:41:29.950]  Well, you know, there's been like posts and stuff I've been seeing.
[01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:33.510]  I follow some of these mom groups and stuff because of the CBD stuff, obviously.
[01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:37.670]  And there's obviously a lot of posts about the pregnancy and smoking and
[01:41:37.670 --> 01:41:43.430]  fetuses don't, they're in the womb, you know, they, their lungs are developing.
[01:41:43.470 --> 01:41:48.990]  They're not taking in oxygen from the, from the air outside.
[01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:53.430]  They're taking in what mom, because they would drown in amniotic fluid, right?
[01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.630]  Yeah.
[01:41:53.630 --> 01:41:55.670]  Something I'm not a doctor, but yeah, exactly.
[01:41:55.670 --> 01:41:57.510]  So that's, that's been proven.
[01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:59.790]  So there goes that to the debate.
[01:41:59.910 --> 01:42:04.590]  And I just think with everything that we've been lied to about cannabis as well,
[01:42:04.590 --> 01:42:07.990]  you know, like there was a part of time, Philip Morris said it was okay for you to
[01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:10.150]  have a smoke, you know, if you're pregnant.
[01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:10.590]  Yeah.
[01:42:10.590 --> 01:42:14.470]  So, so to that regard, I'd love for there to be some research done on it.
[01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:19.190]  You know, I would never, in my opinion, would I ever turn away a patient that was
[01:42:19.190 --> 01:42:22.510]  pregnant because you're from me because of my opinion?
[01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:26.910]  No, I would totally do everything I can to offer them the cleanest meds to dab or
[01:42:26.910 --> 01:42:32.430]  smoke or, you know, preferably vaporize, you know, just me personally, I would just
[01:42:33.670 --> 01:42:39.670]  go out of the way to suggest the cleanest forms of medication, edibles, tinctures,
[01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:42.590]  vaporization, you know, that you can provide.
[01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.870]  I like your approach.
[01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:47.710]  Uh, let the women do what women feel like they should do because we are
[01:42:47.710 --> 01:42:48.870]  not women nor doctors.
[01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:49.190]  Yeah.
[01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:55.550]  Uh, so, uh, to my listener who asked what we feel about it, I'm trying to, uh, find
[01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:56.870]  some information on it.
[01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:58.870]  There's not, all the information is conflicting.
[01:42:58.870 --> 01:43:00.150]  There's no real studies.
[01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:04.870]  There are hearsay studies, I think, but I don't think there's any like actual, this
[01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:08.550]  lady smoked all nine months of her pregnancy and this lady didn't hear his baby A and
[01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:09.150]  baby B.
[01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:10.390]  I haven't seen that yet.
[01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:15.790]  Well, there's been a study done about testing breast milk and they took the
[01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:19.670]  breast milk of women who never fucking smoke cannabis in their damn lives, let
[01:43:19.670 --> 01:43:21.550]  alone in the generation where you're headed.
[01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:22.110]  Yes.
[01:43:22.150 --> 01:43:24.910]  And they found natural cannabinoids in breast milk.
[01:43:25.150 --> 01:43:32.470]  So here's my theory, you know, um, there's people that don't need to smoke
[01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:34.910]  cannabis or don't have a big involvement with it.
[01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:39.390]  And then I look at them like health wise and they seem to have a healthy
[01:43:39.390 --> 01:43:41.710]  endocannabinoid system that's self-regulating.
[01:43:41.710 --> 01:43:44.750]  There's no problem, you know, whatever the case is.
[01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:49.630]  That's obviously not the case with some of us, you know, as we need to regulate
[01:43:50.190 --> 01:43:53.630]  whatever, whether we need to work, whether we need to relax, whether we need to
[01:43:53.630 --> 01:43:58.750]  calm down and we do it with this beautiful plant because our body's inability and
[01:43:59.390 --> 01:44:04.670]  deficiency of natural reoccurring cannabinoids, um, that can evolve well
[01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:05.710]  under whether we were breast milk.
[01:44:05.710 --> 01:44:08.790]  That's a whole nother fucking conversation, but back to my point.
[01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:11.270]  Um, so there's natural cannabinoids in breast milk.
[01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:17.830]  It can't hurt to when you're doing, having clean medicine to enrich and
[01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:22.630]  nourish your natural, you know, milk to give your offspring, if it's only
[01:44:22.630 --> 01:44:27.670]  building and helping them have better antibodies and helping them build better,
[01:44:27.670 --> 01:44:29.470]  you know, immune systems and whatnot.
[01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:35.230]  Um, and also giving them a better chance of not having deficiencies in those senses.
[01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:40.870]  Uh, so yeah, again, I'm, I'm all for more study of that, you know,
[01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:43.110]  the big point of life is to survive.
[01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:46.070]  So I think once that child's born, it will consume that breast milk.
[01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:47.790]  That breast milk has cannabinoids in it.
[01:44:48.150 --> 01:44:50.710]  What happens when you consume a lot of cannabinoids, you get hungrier, right?
[01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:51.070]  Yeah.
[01:44:51.110 --> 01:44:51.910]  So what are you going to want to do?
[01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:53.350]  You're going to want to consume more breast milk.
[01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:54.310]  What's that baby going to do?
[01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:56.110]  Grow stronger, get stronger.
[01:44:56.110 --> 01:44:56.990]  And then what's it going to want?
[01:44:57.150 --> 01:44:57.870]  More breast milk.
[01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:58.310]  Yeah.
[01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:58.710]  Yeah.
[01:44:58.750 --> 01:45:02.030]  So hopefully it's shitty on titty, but Hey, great for the baby.
[01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.590]  Hey, yeah.
[01:45:02.590 --> 01:45:04.750]  Well, so there's my two cents on that.
[01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:11.230]  I'm sorry if it's like a little awkward about it, but you know, I'd love to see
[01:45:11.230 --> 01:45:11.910]  research done.
[01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:13.750]  I'd love to see, here's what I'd love to see.
[01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:20.750]  I'd love to see more moms justifying the science of it and being more, uh,
[01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:28.350]  explaining, explaining the situation better, uh, as opposed to just like
[01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:32.550]  taking a picture of their tit out in their kid's mouth and like saying that
[01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:34.710]  they're, you know, opposing something like, dude, no one cares.
[01:45:34.710 --> 01:45:35.350]  We're beyond that.
[01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:38.630]  Let's get to, you know, and I'm talking about cannabis moms, not just moms in
[01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:43.030]  general, you know, like I get it and don't care, like free the titty, whatever.
[01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:46.070]  Like anyways, who's afraid of titties?
[01:45:46.110 --> 01:45:46.430]  Yeah.
[01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:51.870]  That's obviously a lot of people are horrible people that are afraid of
[01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:52.390]  cannabis.
[01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:53.110]  Exactly.
[01:45:53.110 --> 01:45:57.270]  So yeah, dude, you know, all for women doing that with cannabis, you know?
[01:45:57.310 --> 01:46:01.510]  Uh, and like I said, there's stuff to tinctures, fucking transdermals.
[01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:05.470]  Um, I know of a mom that used like natural hemp products to not get any
[01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:09.630]  fucking stretch marks and she blew up like a damn whale and didn't stretch her
[01:46:09.630 --> 01:46:10.750]  fucking skin out once.
[01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:11.910]  And sorry to be blunt about it.
[01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:15.270]  I will not use her name, but shout out to cannabis.
[01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:16.390]  Yeah.
[01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:20.190]  And, but just saying, you know, like even on a hemp, on a hemp CBD scale, it can
[01:46:20.190 --> 01:46:21.230]  just help your skin.
[01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:23.750]  It can, it can help you have a more comfortable pregnancy.
[01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:24.430]  So why not?
[01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:27.950]  You want to be comfortable, you know, you want, you don't want to be
[01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:29.030]  stressed at all at that time.
[01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:34.270]  So if cannabis, uh, the CBD products, you know, can help you do that and they can,
[01:46:34.670 --> 01:46:38.230]  you know, I think that's a lot better than, I don't really know the science of
[01:46:38.230 --> 01:46:42.030]  prenatal drugs, but they make me a little curious.
[01:46:42.230 --> 01:46:42.590]  Yeah.
[01:46:42.670 --> 01:46:43.030]  Yeah.
[01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:46.750]  With all the vaccinations and all the crazy shit that we have going on with
[01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:50.230]  autism and other things like that, it just makes me curious and nervous.
[01:46:50.230 --> 01:46:52.030]  So, you know, go cannabis.
[01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:53.030]  Go cannabis.
[01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:55.270]  That is a great way to end this podcast, bro.
[01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:56.430]  I want to thank you for coming in and hanging out.
[01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:57.590]  You've been here for like three hours.
[01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:58.750]  I truly appreciate it.
[01:46:58.750 --> 01:47:01.750]  We've probably smoked like a quarter ounce of hash over the time.
[01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.830]  Big shout out to Mike.
[01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:03.070]  Sorry.
[01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.790]  I had to leave early.
[01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:05.990]  Make sure you guys follow white Mike on Twitter.
[01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:07.630]  It's at Nemo punk 15.

[01:47:09.630 --> 01:47:13.470]  It's really be white Mike Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:13.710]  Yeah.
[01:47:13.710 --> 01:47:15.590]  I didn't write that down or anything and I remembered it.
[01:47:15.670 --> 01:47:16.310]  So shout out Mike.
[01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:17.350]  Thanks for coming on the show, bro.
[01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:19.070]  Uh, we're not mad that you had to leave early.
[01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:20.590]  We took plenty of dabs for you.
[01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:21.190]  Yes.
[01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:23.550]  How can my listeners follow you on social media, bro?
[01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:27.230]  Oh, um, so I am a Fox track CBD on Twitter.
[01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:31.190]  I am O X T R a C T S you guys just to clear that up.
[01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:32.310]  Fox tracks.
[01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.910]  Yes.
[01:47:33.150 --> 01:47:34.070]  Help my listeners out there.
[01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.350]  Hi.
[01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:35.470]  I appreciate that.
[01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:38.470]  Um, Foxtrot CBD spelled the same way.
[01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:44.230]  Um, I'm sorry, just Foxtrot on Instagram and run CBD genetics on Instagram as well.
[01:47:44.230 --> 01:47:50.190]  And then also, um, I'm going to just on a really quick note, um, I'm going to be in
[01:47:50.190 --> 01:47:54.310]  house working with a new company called Athena green.
[01:47:54.790 --> 01:48:01.110]  Uh, and it's another breeder that's focused on, um, medical strains, focusing
[01:48:01.150 --> 01:48:03.990]  on clusters and migraine headaches, Crohn's.
[01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:07.830]  And then I'm working together with the stuff I'm doing with my CBD in similar
[01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:15.590]  regards to help create a better medicinal attributed strains with.
[01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.990]  Good trips.
[01:48:17.150 --> 01:48:19.910]  They're very simple and just very, very simple goal, you know?
[01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:23.110]  So it's hard to get that good medicine and good tasting
[01:48:23.110 --> 01:48:24.990]  medicine and the same regard.
[01:48:24.990 --> 01:48:26.790]  So that's our goal for the years.
[01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:29.310]  And I'll obviously be talking with you about that sooner.
[01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:31.510]  We will, we will collab on some of that.
[01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.750]  I'm sure.
[01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:32.790]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:33.310]  So yeah.
[01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:38.270]  Uh, you'll see everything posted on my Instagram, Fox jacks or on the run CBD
[01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:41.070]  page or on Twitter when I'm born.
[01:48:41.150 --> 01:48:43.230]  Cause I'm dumb and I forgot how to use it.
[01:48:44.630 --> 01:48:45.870]  A lot of people forget about the Twitter.
[01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:46.390]  Yes.
[01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:47.430]  I'm all over Twitter.
[01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:48.150]  A lot of people use it.
[01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.590]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:49.870]  It's it's, it's going down.
[01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:50.750]  It's slowed down a little bit.
[01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.350]  All right.
[01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:52.830]  You guys want to thank you guys for listening.

[01:49:12.150 --> 01:49:12.950]  I don't have any sponsors.

[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:23.080]  Right.

[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.400]  I got some stuff I want to talk about.
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:05.040]  Guess what?
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:06.800]  Uh, finally happened yesterday.
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:07.920]  I got fucking pulled over.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:10.520]  I was going a little bit too fast on the interstate.
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.240]  Um, I saw him get behind me.
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:14.760]  I said, ah, shit, here they come.
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:15.960]  And here he was right away.
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:17.680]  Those red and blue lights got right up on my ass.
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:18.560]  He got it behind me.
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:21.560]  Uh, I pulled over quickly cause I saw that he was there.
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.960]  Uh, I happen to be wearing my brand new.
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.320]  I'm higher than you t-shirt.
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:26.400]  Shout out to my buddy, Adam ill.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:28.400]  He threw me an I'm higher than you t-shirt.
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:29.880]  So I've got this shirt on this is straight up.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:30.680]  I'm higher than you.
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:32.160]  And I get pulled over by the state patrol.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.840]  Uh, state trooper was actually pretty damn cool.
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:36.920]  He walked up to me and he said, sir, I pulled you over.
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:38.280]  Cause you were going a little too fast.
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:39.640]  And my only answer was yes, sir.
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:41.200]  Cause I knew I was going too fucking fast.
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:41.960]  So I told him, yes, sir.
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:44.880]  And he said, uh, can I see your license registration, proof of insurance?
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:45.880]  And I already had it in my hand.
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:47.000]  Cause I'm quick and organized.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  I was like, here you go, sir.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:51.880]  And he said, uh, do you have any marijuana in the vehicle?
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:54.720]  And I hesitated for a minute and I wasn't going to lie to him.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:58.040]  I was thinking, uh, I looked at my backpack and then I looked at my center
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:01.240]  console in my car, and then I looked toward the back seat to see where all my
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:02.760]  bags were and see what I had with me.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:05.480]  And I looked him straight in the face and I said, there might be some weed in here,
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:05.760]  sir.
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:07.360]  And he kind of looked at me weird.
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:10.360]  And I said, but I've got a medical marijuana card and I assure you I'm
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:12.240]  not intoxicated by any means.
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:13.440]  And it was early in the morning.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:14.280]  I was on my way to work.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:17.280]  And so, uh, he goes, well, it really smells in there.
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:21.560]  And I said, oh, and I had my, uh, when you work in a, in a legal facility
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:24.320]  here in Colorado, you've got to wear a badge and it happened to have it on me.
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:25.920]  So I just showed him my badge real quick.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:27.360]  I said, sir, I work in a grow.
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:28.400]  So I always stink.
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.920]  And this cop, you guys, this is why I'm telling you this story.
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.400]  This cop looked at me and he said, oh, I understand my daughter
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:35.680]  works in a grow as well.
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:36.440]  Hang tight.
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:37.440]  I'm going to go run your plate.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.280]  So this cop, his daughter, this guy's a state trooper and his daughter
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:44.480]  works in a grow here in Colorado.
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:46.720]  So he goes and he runs my plates and runs my license.
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:47.720]  I'm not wanted or anything.
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:48.160]  I'm legit.
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:49.160]  So I just sat there and waited.
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:50.360]  I actually took a Snapchat.
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:54.600]  So if you want to see up on my Instagram and on Snapchat and on Facebook, there's
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:56.120]  a picture of me being pulled over by this cop.
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:58.080]  So he goes and he runs my license.
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:58.960]  He does what he's got to do.
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:00.120]  He's actually pretty quick about it.
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:03.160]  A couple of times I've been pulled over and they make you just fucking sit there
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:04.480]  all day and make sure you're late for work.
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:05.480]  But this guy was pretty quick.
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:07.520]  Uh, he went and he wrote me a warning.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:09.200]  He did not write me a speeding ticket.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:13.040]  He wrote me a, an official warning and he told me to set it on the
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:14.880]  dash to remind me to quit speeding.
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:15.480]  So I did that.
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:17.160]  I've got the warning sitting up on the dash.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:20.360]  So that every time I start to get in the left lane to pass somebody, it reminds
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:22.680]  me of, Hey, you're going to get a ticket next time because that cop
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:23.960]  was really cool to you last time.
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:26.080]  So I've got a warning sitting up there.
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:27.680]  I want to give a huge shout out to this state trooper.
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:28.640]  I'm not going to say his name.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.400]  Uh, but shout out to the state trooper.
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:34.000]  He did not harass me when I completely reeked of cannabis.
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:37.480]  He did not write me a ticket when I was obviously blatantly speeding.
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:40.000]  So a big shout out to the Colorado state patrol.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:40.840]  I appreciate it.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:42.240]  You did not fuck my day up.
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:43.320]  You did not fuck my life up.
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:46.320]  Things could have gone very differently as we've learned with my friend, John
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:47.080]  Randall's jr.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:49.080]  So a big shout out to the state patrol.
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:50.080]  Big shout out to Jara.
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:51.880]  Staffari for keeping an eye straight through that.
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:53.000]  Um, yeah.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.160]  So you guys, it's all about how you handle the police.
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:57.520]  If you're in Colorado and you get pulled over and they ask if
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.760]  you've got cannabis in the car.
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:02.120]  Just admit it because lying to the cops is illegal.
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:04.920]  Having cannabis in Colorado is not illegal.
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:07.760]  If you're going to lie to him about having weed, he's not going to trust you.
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:09.320]  He's going to think you're hiding some shit.
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:11.320]  You don't need to hide your weed in Colorado.
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:12.280]  This is Colorado.
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:14.680]  So long as you don't have pounds, if you've got your legal limit,
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:15.560]  you should be legit.
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:16.160]  Don't even lie.
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:18.960]  And if you are doing something illegal and you got more than you
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:20.160]  should, don't fucking speed.
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.280]  I think we went over that in a previous episode.
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:23.720]  Only break one rule at a time.
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:24.120]  You guys.
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:24.840]  All right.
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:26.400]  I'll quit talking about a traffic stop.
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:29.080]  Uh, since we're talking about the police, here's one more
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:30.240]  thing I do need to mention.
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:34.040]  I am a, I don't know if everybody that listens realizes that I am the
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:36.360]  owner, founder, proprietor, head breeder.
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:38.520]  Uh, I am I read genetics, Colorado.
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:42.200]  We are, I am the seed company that makes a feminized, irregular cannabis seeds.
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:46.000]  Uh, I receive a lot of messages on Instagram, Facebook.
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:49.840]  Um, emails, any, any forum you could think of.
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:53.840]  I get an email or a message via that service asking me to ship seeds
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:55.680]  to people in various locations.
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:58:59.240]  Uh, you guys, I might've said this on another episode, but I have to remind
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:01.320]  you, I cannot ship seeds to anybody.
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.240]  I am trying to be fully legal.
[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:04.400]  I'm trying to be fully legit.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.600]  I'm trying not to break any rules here in Colorado.
[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:07.640]  They're letting us grow.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:10.960]  I've got a wonderful job at green and healthy wellness is the lead grower.
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:14.640]  Um, there's no need for me to screw that up in my life by sending people
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:16.160]  seeds to make a few extra bucks.
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:17.600]  I'm doing just fine financially.
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:21.320]  Um, I'm doing fucking great financially not to brag, but I mean, there's no,
[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:22.640]  I don't even need to send you seeds.
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:23.360]  I'm doing okay.
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:24.520]  There is a website.
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:27.400]  However, they are called the dank team.com.
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:29.840]  Sometimes they have my seeds available.
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:31.800]  They are currently sold out is what I'm told.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:34.280]  They will get a package in the future.
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:37.040]  I can't promise you when, I don't know when they'll put them on sale.
[01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:39.000]  I don't know if they'll even make it to the website.
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.120]  They may have people lined up on a waiting list already.
[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:41.920]  I don't know.
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:45.760]  What I do know is soon as, as soon as they get those seeds, they sell out quickly.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:49.120]  So you'll have to pay attention to the dank team.com.
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:52.600]  If you're trying to get seeds, if they don't have iri genetic seeds,
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:56.120]  check out sin city, check out mile high, check out can adventure.
[01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:58.080]  A rare dankness is always good.
[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:00.800]  I'm not sure if the sour seed company is on there, but I highly
[02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:02.320]  recommend the sour seed company.
[02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:05.400]  You can never go wrong with the Cali connection and you can never
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:07.080]  go wrong with DJ short seeds.
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:08.760]  So find yourself some good seeds.
[02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:12.800]  Even if they aren't I received, you can get them at the dank team.com.
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:14.040]  I apologize that I can't ship you.
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:17.520]  See the guys trying to be safe, trying to be careful, try not to break any rules.
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:20.440]  If you're here in Colorado and you're 21 and over.
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:22.760]  Find me, let's get together.
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:24.240]  We can put some seeds in your garden.
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:25.400]  All right.
[02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:26.280]  I just wanted to be fair.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.320]  Want to be polite about that.
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.720]  I can't ship you anything.
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:30.680]  What's next.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:30.880]  All right.
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:31.680]  I got an email.
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:33.040]  Actually, this was a Facebook message.
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:34.920]  I'm going to go ahead and open up the Facebook page.
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:37.240]  I've got it.
[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:38.720]  It's taking my phone a second.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.320]  I might edit part of this out.
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:44.120]  Where's the damn message.
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:45.480]  Okay.
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:47.000]  All right.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.600]  So this message comes from a friend on the grow from your heart podcast, Facebook page.
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:53.040]  This is from our friend Elizabeth.
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:54.440]  And she says, quick question.
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:56.800]  I'm growing a few, a few plants from seed.
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:06.680]  And I was wondering if when I take a cutting to flower for determining sex, if I should flower the clone or the rooted seedling, I could swear that I heard you say it was better to flower the rooted seedling.
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.240]  Did I remember that correctly?
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.600]  There is not a, a rule to this.
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:15.240]  This is kind of personal preference.
[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:30.120]  If so, what, let me back up and tell you basically what this person's asking, just to be more clear in case you guys aren't caught up to what this, the question here is when you grow a plant from seed, you don't know if that plant is a male or a female, unless of course it came from feminized seeds.
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:34.160]  So if you grow a regular seed, it's got a 50, 50 chance of being a male or a female.
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:41.280]  You don't want to waste a lot of time, space, energy, nutrients, and water on a plant that you don't need.
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:44.400]  So unless you're breeding, you need to eliminate your male plants.
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:50.800]  So once your seed plant gets large enough, I recommend taking a clone from it.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.160]  Let that clone establish healthy roots.
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:02:01.440]  Now you need to flower either the original plant from seed or that clone to determine if that plant is a male or a female.
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:03.120]  It's really up to you.
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:11.600]  If you want to flower out the plant that came from seed, or if you want to flower the clone, there are advantages and disadvantages to both sides.
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:30.800]  If you've got that plant that came from seed and it's big enough to take a clone, once that clone is rooted and you know you've got a copy of it, you're safe to flower out that seed plant, the original plant from seed, because now you've got a backup in the clone room, in the mom room, whatever, in the bedroom, you've got a backup of that plant over there.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  And you've already got a plant that's established and that's large and that's healthy and is ready to flower and ready to throw out some buds for you.
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:39.560]  So you can always flower out that seed plant.
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:42.280]  The advantage to that is it's already there.
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:43.240]  It's ready to go.
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:44.840]  You've got it a big, healthy plant.
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:50.280]  Some people really like to keep that original seeded plant from seed around as their mother.
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:56.080]  They like to keep that one because it was the original and they feel like it's got more vigor and it's got more strength to it.
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:08.000]  But I feel like if you take a clone and you do it properly and that clone is cared for and the mother plant, the donor plant was healthy when the clone was taken, I feel like the clone and that seed plant are going to be the same thing.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:10.120]  So you can take your clone.
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:11.280]  You can let your clone root.
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.240]  You can get your clone into soil.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:15.840]  You can get it into a good pot, get some roots established.
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:16.760]  You can do it in a cup.
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:17.840]  I've done this in cups.
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.160]  I've ran pheno hunts from cups before.
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:24.840]  I've done plenty of plant sexting while plant, while clones were just in little tiny cups.
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:32.280]  So you can take your clone and you can either pot it into a larger pot if you want, or you can leave it in the cup and put it in the flower room and put it into flower.
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:34.040]  Change the lights to 1212.
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:38.360]  And of course, within seven to 10 days, you're going to see if that plant is a male or a female.
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:51.560]  Now, one of the main advantages to keeping your clones in cups and using the cup method to do a sexing round is that it takes way less space to run a whole bunch of cups than it would run a bunch of potted plants.
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:04:02.440]  So if you're doing a large pheno hunt of like maybe 25 to 50 plants, it's much easier to have 25 to 50 cups underneath the light with little tiny clones in there, just waiting to show you sex.
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:05.000]  And that way you didn't waste time growing large plants.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  And then you grew out a male that was a waste of time.
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:08.840]  So that's the advantage to do in the cups.
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:10.040]  It's one of the advantages.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:14.640]  Um, it's up to you, whichever you want to do, really, if you want to take it, always take a clone.
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:17.720]  So grow that plant from seed, take a clone, get the clone rooted.
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:18.920]  And then it's up to you.
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:23.280]  If you want to run that clone as your flowering plant to determine sex, go for it.
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:27.080]  If you want to run that seed as your flowering plant to determine sex, go for it.
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:30.640]  As long as you keep one of them back to have in the future.
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:35.280]  If you run that clone, you've already got a big mother plant waiting to give you more clones.
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:39.600]  If you run the mother plant that came from seed, you've already got a big bushy plant.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:40.560]  There are advantages.
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:42.560]  In a production facility.
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:44.440]  What I do is I plant the seed.
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:45.320]  I let the seed grow.
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:46.400]  I take the clone.
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:55.240]  Uh, as soon as that clone shows me roots, I throw that clone into a pot and then I actually flower out the original plant from seed because it's already big enough.
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:56.160]  It's ready to go.
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:05:00.040]  And honestly, in a commercial production facility, I don't have a lot of time and space.
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:07.600]  Uh, for extra plants sitting around and I don't want to waste my plant count because we are based on a plant count because we are a medical facility.
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.040]  We're allowed to have so many plants.
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:15.440]  So since I've already got a plant that's large enough to flower, I go ahead and flower that plant out to find out what I've got.
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:18.720]  If I find out that I've got a male, uh, usually I go throw that.
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:20.960]  I cut that male down, take it out of the computer system.
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:25.240]  And then I go and take down every clone also that I have made of that male plant.
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:29.360]  And we eliminate those as well so that we don't have any males sitting around.
[02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:34.680]  And that is how, mainly how we, uh, work on sexing our plants.
[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:35.800]  There is another method.
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:40.240]  This kind of helps me segue into something else I wanted to talk about, which is re-vegging.
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:42.120]  Another thing that you can do.
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:44.200]  I do not use this method.
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:45.440]  I know plenty of people that do.
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:48.000]  Uh, for me, this seems a little bit harsh to my plants.
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.080]  What some people do.
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:55.800]  You can take a plant and put it into your flowering room for seven to 10 days, just long enough to show you sex.
[02:05:56.160 --> 02:06:01.320]  Usually I think I can spot a male more early than I can a female because I've been doing it for so long.
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:04.080]  I think the males try to show you sex a little bit sooner.
[02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:08.520]  So take your plants, put them in the flowering room, let them start showing you sex.
[02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:16.080]  As soon as you are sure of the sex, take them out of the flowering room, put them back in the bedroom under, uh, under 24 hours of light.
[02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:18.160]  And they will go back into veg for you.
[02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:21.440]  It may take them a couple of weeks, but they will go back into veg.
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:22.920]  So what some people do.
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:24.520]  They plant a seed.
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:27.400]  They let the seed grow until it's, you know, decent size.
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:32.720]  Uh, right when you put that seed into your three gallon pot, let it get rooted and then move it to the flower room.
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:34.760]  And then they just leave it there for a few days.
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:37.240]  And now they've got a little plant that's starting to show sex.
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:40.120]  And then as soon as it shows sex, they put it back in the bedroom.
[02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:44.960]  If it's a female, they put it back into the bedroom and grow it up to the bigger size that they want.
[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:47.880]  Then take a clone from it and then flower that plant out.
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:50.840]  Now this sounds harsh, but it does have its advantages.
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:57.480]  The main advantage here is that you don't need to take any clones and you don't waste a lot of time and space growing anything.
[02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:59.760]  So you take your plants and you put them into flower.
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.960]  And as soon as you see boys, you throw them away.
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:07.440]  And then now you can just move your plants right back into the bedroom and just grow those females up to their full size.
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:10.760]  So you establish sex without taking any clones.
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:13.560]  And now you know what you've got and you've eliminated your boys.
[02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:16.200]  So when it comes flower time, you know, you're working with all girls.
[02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:19.520]  I highly recommend taking a clone from everything.
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:25.200]  So before you flower those plants, please take a clone because you might grow the most amazing cannabis you've ever had.
[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:28.960]  And if you don't have a clone from it, you're going to kick yourself in the ass.
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:32.480]  Re-vegging is also used after harvest.
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:34.680]  And I've seen people finish a plant.
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:38.080]  You take a plant that takes nine weeks to flower.
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:39.800]  You flower it out for nine weeks.
[02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:49.360]  You harvest most of it, but you just leave one or two branches on that plant and then put that plant with one or two harvested plant with one or two branches
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:51.560]  on it under 24 hours of light.
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:58.080]  And it's going to take probably two months, honestly, before that plant starts to grow back as a normal vegging plant.
[02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:02.720]  And if you didn't take a clone, this is your only way to rescue your strain.
[02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:09.000]  You take this sad looking, mostly harvested plant and you torture it by putting it under a light for about two months.
[02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:10.600]  You want it under 24 hours of light.
[02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.720]  You want to feed it kind of a heavy nitrogen diet.
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:15.240]  That'll bring it back around to the veg stage.
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:18.720]  The leaves are going to start curling and looking like arthritis hands.
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:19.920]  They're going to be spirally.
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:22.600]  The plant is going to be pissed off for quite a while.
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:28.040]  But as soon as you see those normal leaves start coming out, your plant is going back into its normal stage.
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:31.120]  The hormones have started reconverting back into the veg stage.
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:33.080]  It's starting to know what's going on with life again.
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:43.080]  What I would recommend at that point, as soon as you have a couple of healthy shoots that look normal, clone those and take those clones and use those clones as your plants.
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:45.320]  And now you've got that strain around again.
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:47.920]  Keep one clone and flower out the other clones.
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:49.520]  And now you've got that strain forever.
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:09:04.080]  I don't recommend that, but if you do make the mistake of not taking a clone and you realize that this plant that you're growing is going to be one of the most amazing things you've ever seen, revegging is probably the only way to rescue this strain other than a tissue culture.
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:07.880]  And I am not prepared to teach you how to do a tissue culture through a podcast.
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:10.640]  So Elizabeth, I hope I answered your question.
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:12.600]  I know I did not give a definitive answer.
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:17.960]  I know I said that it's kind of up to you and your environment and the way that you want to do things, but I hope I helped you out.
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:24.440]  And thanks for giving me the opportunity to talk about how to sex your plants and revegging.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:25.840]  All right.
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:31.520]  My next topic comes from at the barefoot grower on Instagram, also known as Will on Facebook.
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:33.760]  Uh, Will had no idea I was going to talk about this.
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:39.720]  Will posted a Facebook post today that simply said, stop smoking blunts in your grow room.
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:41.760]  And that is such a good post.
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:49.560]  He had no idea I was going to talk about this on, on the podcast today, but I see people posting pictures of themselves on Facebook, on Instagram and on Snapchat.
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:53.920]  And they are smoking blunts, smoking bowls and smoking dabs in the grow room.
[02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:55.960]  And I think it's a really bad idea.
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:10:04.120]  I think smoking a blunt in a grow room is going to impart that blunt taste on your growing buds before those buds are even done.
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:06.760]  They're already going to taste like a dirty blunt wrap.
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:09.040]  I'm sorry, you guys, I don't prefer the flavor of a blunt.
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:12.280]  We grow some of the best cannabis we can possibly grow on this planet.
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.720]  And then you wrap it up in a shitty ass tobacco leaf with some fake flavoring in it.
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:16.880]  I don't dig it.
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:19.320]  I smoked a backwood with my buddy the other day.
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:20.520]  Not my thing.
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:27.560]  I'm not into the blunts, but I feel that blowing this blunt smoke on your plants around your plants is going to make your plants taste like a dirty ass blunt.
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:30.720]  But also here's what Will had to say about this.
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:36.760]  Uh, Will said tobacco smoke is very thick and actually can suffocate your plants, stopping the photosynthesis process.
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.800]  Because the plant will be too busy breathing and filtering the smoke to take in CO2.
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:48.920]  Uh, and then he also goes on to say also blunts and most over the counter tobacco products have a ton of chemicals in them that are bad for your plants.
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:54.200]  Cigarettes are the main concern, but blunts will begin to show harmful results if done regularly and frequently.
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:56.720]  Really, you shouldn't smoke anything in your grow room.
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:57.720]  I agree with that.
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:00.320]  And then he says, but if you're going to, it should be a bowl.
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:05.320]  The less carcinogens in the air, the healthier your plants will be.
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:06.920]  Uh, I think I agree with that.
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:07.960]  Will good post.
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:08.840]  Great post.
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:10.560]  You guys quit smoking in your grow rooms.
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:13.240]  You don't want to be in the grow room, giving your plants smoke.
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:16.000]  You want to be in the grow room, giving your plants love and CO2.
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:17.320]  Don't blow smoke in there.
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:19.240]  Just keep the plants clean.
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:20.320]  You're going to ruin the terpenes.
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:21.600]  It's all about the turps nowadays.
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:24.960]  And nobody wants tobacco turps in their cannabis.
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:25.480]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:33.960]  Maybe somebody wants tobacco turps in their cannabis, but 99% of the world doesn't want tobacco turps in their cannabis and nobody wants tobacco turps in their concentrates.
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:35.960]  So stop smoking blunts in your grow room.
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:38.360]  Stop smoking anything in your grow room.
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:44.320]  Go outside, go smoke outside, go to the candy canyon, go smoke at the candy canyon, go smoke at the dab table.
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:45.480]  Just don't smoke in the grow room.
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:48.800]  It's not good for your plants and quit smoking cigarettes and tobacco.
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:50.480]  Anyway, let's just get down on cannabis.
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:53.280]  You guys organic cannabis.
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:53.860]  All right.
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:12:01.000]  I've been talking for nearly 19 minutes, so I think it's time for me to press pause, take a drink, take a fat dab, and I will be right back.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:01.500]  Hang tight.
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:03.560]  All right, you guys.
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:04.060]  I am back.
[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:06.280]  I took a couple of fat dabs and I got a nice drink.
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:14.640]  While I was taking a drink, I was drinking some kombucha, some GT's kombucha organic and raw original with enzymes and probiotics.
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:18.680]  And it reminded me that a listener recently asked me a question about probiotics.
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:20.880]  He asked me if I could recommend a brand.
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:22.400]  He asked about a specific brand.
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:26.840]  Honestly, what I like is the brand Raw Probiotics.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:32.240]  You can buy specific blends for men or women or for older folks or for children.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:35.680]  So I'm pretty sure that the person that emailed me was a dude.
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:38.800]  So I would recommend the Raw Probiotics for men.
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:40.720]  They're available at most health food stores.
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:43.320]  Those are the probiotics I would support.
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:46.600]  Now let's talk more about cannabis related stuff.
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:51.800]  Somebody recently sent me a message asking me if I think holding in your smoke gets you higher.
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:59.560]  If you take a dab, if you take a bong rip, if you smoke a joint, do you feel like holding your hit, holding your smoke in your lungs gives you a better buzz?
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:02.200]  In my opinion, I'm going to say I'm not a doctor.
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:03.440]  Let me put that out there straight up.
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:04.280]  I'm not a doctor.
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:05.840]  This is my stoner opinion.
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:16.000]  I feel like when I take a dab, I feel like most of what I'm going to get goes into my lungs pretty quickly within probably three seconds at the most, maybe five seconds.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.960]  I have absorbed everything that that dab is going to give me.
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:20.400]  So I get it in.
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:22.800]  I let it sit for about a half a second, maybe a second.
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:26.560]  I pull in the dab and then I blow it back out.
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:29.200]  It's only in me for just a brief second, just so that I could feel it in there.
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:30.280]  Then I push it back out.
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:34.560]  I feel like when you keep the smoke in your lungs is when it's going to cause problems.
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:38.320]  I feel like my lungs absorb everything they're going to get really quickly.
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:43.080]  If I keep that smoke in there, I'm going to start absorbing the TARS and the soot and the extra crap.
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:45.600]  The smoke is going to stick to my lungs and I don't want that.
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:46.840]  I want to get the cannabinoids.
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:47.920]  I want the THC.
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:49.640]  I want the CBD, the CBG.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.040]  I want the good medical benefits, not the bad part of the smoke.
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:58.800]  So I think taking a big fat dab and holding it in, you might not get higher.
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:04.880]  I think you're just getting a head rush from lack of oxygen and you're just feeling a rush because you're not giving yourself any air.
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:12.120]  And also I feel like that pressure, having your lungs inflated like that is probably very strenuous on your lungs.
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:13.920]  You could probably hurt yourself by doing that.
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:22.120]  And then those people that take in a big hit and they cough and they try not to cough and hold in the big hit, you make this noise, you start doing that shit.
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:24.800]  I really feel like that's going to blow something up in your body.
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:25.960]  You're going to rupture the lung.
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:27.840]  You're going to fucking blow a blood vessel in your brain.
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:30.040]  I think you need to get the smoke in and out.
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:32.040]  I don't think smoke needs to sit around in your lungs.
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:33.440]  That is my opinion.
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:34.760]  I don't think you get higher from it.
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:36.600]  I don't think you're going to absorb more from it.
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:38.880]  I think that's going to happen almost instantly.
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:45.800]  I think you're just putting yourself at risk for COPD or other lung problems in the future.
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:48.520]  I want to elaborate on this a little bit.
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:54.360]  One thing that I think happens, I take ginormous dabs sometimes.
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:56.200]  I like to take a big fat dab.
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:57.840]  The other day I took a two gram dab.
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:14:58.800]  I didn't cough.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:00.040]  Let me be clear.
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:11.040]  I'm not able to put two grams on the nail and pull it all into my lungs in one draw because I would have to put the nail really hot to get it to burn or vaporize that quickly.
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:14.600]  So I am taking multiple inhalations, but I'm not taking a break.
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:18.760]  I'm dropping two grams, one and a half to two grams of dabs on the nail.
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:20.120]  Just drop it right on there.
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:27.440]  You got to kind of slowly stir it into the nail and let it melt into there and then carb cap it and just start sucking on that rig.
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:29.480]  Pull in a big fat hit, blow it out.
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:30.920]  Pull in another rip, blow it out.
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:38.880]  Sometimes it'll take me three or four full inhalations, a full lung expand in and out of my lungs, but I'll smoke two grams in one dab.
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:39.760]  I call that one dab.
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:40.560]  That is one dab.
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:42.920]  I didn't take a break or anything, but it wasn't all one rip.
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:52.680]  I feel like I can feel the hash coat my lungs and I feel like I'm kind of giving myself a time release medicine.
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:16:03.560]  I'm smoking so much hash in one quick time period that I'm coating my lungs with enough oil to where my body can absorb it all at once, but there's nowhere for it to go.
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:05.680]  So all this oil kind of hangs out.
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:08.360]  All this hash is just hanging out, stuck to my lung.
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:11.800]  And as my body can absorb it, that hash is right there.
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:19.040]  So my lungs are just sucking up that hash oil the whole time and I'm just absorbing those cannabinoids and absorbing those medicinal qualities.
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:23.520]  So I'm giving myself a time release medication by taking these ginormous dabs.
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:24.840]  That's something I think is happening.
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:28.280]  I have no science to that, but I feel like I stay high.
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:29.440]  I stay getting high.
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:32.240]  I just keep getting higher and higher and higher as it goes.
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:41.480]  And I haven't, sometimes I won't have smoked for a full hour and I'll still be fully medicated because I think that a layer of dab that is coated in my lungs.
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:44.960]  It's just being absorbed by my body slowly and getting into my bloodstream.
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:47.160]  So that's my elaboration.
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:48.480]  I hope I answered your question.
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:50.640]  My opinion, holding smoke is a bad idea.
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:51.760]  You don't need to hold it in.
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:52.520]  Don't be cheap.
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:54.800]  Take another dab, breathe it in, blow it out.
[02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:55.840]  Take another damn dab.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.040]  I got another dab for you.
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:01.280]  I think your lungs only get so much use before they wear out.
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:05.760]  I think you get so many inhales and exhales of your lungs before they're just going to tire out.
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:08.640]  So don't wear your lungs out by holding in smoke.
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:09.360]  Just blow it out.
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:09.880]  Get it out of there.
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:10.640]  That's my opinion.
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:11.800]  Let's see.
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:15.200]  I got a couple of more things I want to talk about and then we're going to wrap up this podcast.
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:16.640]  Here's something random.
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:19.320]  You guys wear some protective eyewear in your garden.
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:21.160]  The lights are bright.
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:28.320]  If you're running more than four, maybe five or six lights in there, you need to get yourself some Method 7 glasses and protect your eyes from the lights.
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:29.680]  Also protect your skin.
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:37.200]  If you're in a room with 10 or more lights and you're in there for more than a few hours a day, it's a good idea to wear some sort of long sleeves.
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:38.320]  Keep your head covered.
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:39.360]  Keep your eyes covered.
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:43.560]  Uh, it's just, I believe that those lights are not good for your skin.
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:44.840]  The sun gives us cancer.
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:47.800]  Why won't these artificial lights give us some sort of skin problems?
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:51.440]  You guys, I highly recommend covering up your skin and your eyes.
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:55.280]  If you're in a grow room all day long, I wear my Method 7 glasses.
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:59.600]  Uh, from the minute I walk into the grow room to the minute I walk out, I've got the Method 7s on.
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:01.840]  I like to wear a long sleeve shirt in the grow room.
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:04.640]  It gets kind of hot, but it's still worth wearing a long sleeve shirt.
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.640]  Also, here's something really random.
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:13.720]  When you're in the grow room, if you've got a bunch of sticks, if you're using sticks in there to support your plants, watch your eyes around those sticks.
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:16.200]  I saw somebody bend over the other day to take care of a plant.
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:19.600]  And if he wasn't paying attention, that stick would have gone way far into his eye.
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:20.640]  It kind of poked his eye.
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:21.320]  It didn't hurt him.
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:22.800]  Uh, cause he saw it coming.
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:25.080]  He saw it cause it literally went into his eye.
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:27.720]  He was kneeling down, put the stick right into his eye.
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:28.840]  Didn't fuck him up.
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:29.360]  He survived.
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:30.040]  He'll be just fine.
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:33.440]  But I don't want that to happen to any of my listeners or any of my friends.
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:36.240]  So be very aware of those sticks in your grow room.
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:39.960]  I don't use the sticks I use, uh, in my personal grow, I like a tomato cage.
[02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:43.800]  Um, and the commercial grow, we like to use the big trellis nets.
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.760]  Of course I have used the sticks before and I'll probably use them again, but.
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:49.800]  Um, that's not my preferred method at this time.
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:54.240]  And if you were using them, I do recommend that you watch your eyes.
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:58.000]  And since I'm talking about grow room safety, here's another thing you should think about.
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:06.160]  You should have a smoke detector inside of each grow room, and you should also have a fire extinguisher on the exterior of each grow room.
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:15.560]  Don't put your fire extinguisher inside the grow room because if there is a problem in there, you don't want to have to kick down the door, go in there and get your fire extinguisher and try to put the fire out.
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:22.840]  You want that fire extinguisher on the outside by the door so that if something's wrong, you can kick the door down and spray the fuck out of that fire, solve the problem.
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:28.160]  So smoke detectors and fire extinguishers are a big advantage for your grow.
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:29.440]  Put that shit in there.
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:30.920]  Keep yourself safe.
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:33.600]  All right, you guys, I think that's all I've got for this podcast.
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:36.920]  Pretty soon I've got Jesse coming back for another outdoor grow lesson.
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:38.800]  Jesse, if you're listening, it is time.
[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:39.560]  You can bring the boys.
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:40.680]  We can do a swap cast.
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:42.480]  If you don't know what a swap cast is, I'm going to tell you.
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:49.160]  Uh, Jesse and 44 and dirty D they have a podcast called the Colorado podcast.
[02:19:49.200 --> 02:19:50.640]  I want to have them come on here.
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:55.080]  All three of them will record one podcast and we will both put it out on our feeds.
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:58.680]  So we'll do a Colorado dope grow from your heart podcast combination.
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:00.240]  We'll talk about growing dope.
[02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:01.720]  We'll talk about Colorado life.
[02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:05.160]  And then we'll both put it up on our feeds and I'll expose my audience
[02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:06.640]  to the Colorado podcast.
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:09.880]  The Colorado podcast will expose their audience to myself and
[02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:11.080]  the grow from your heart podcast.
[02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:12.240]  It'll be good for everybody.
[02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:14.120]  So in the future, we'll get Jesse and the crew on here.
[02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:16.640]  If you guys are listening, this is the invitation.
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:17.600]  I want to get you here.
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000]  Also, it is time to get Mike and Lindsay back.
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:21.800]  So we can talk a little bit more about politics.
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:25.160]  If you two are listening, start doing your homework, get an episode prepared.
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:28.360]  We'll get you back on here because that's all I have got for you.
[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:31.200]  What I would appreciate is if you go to iTunes, find the iTunes store,
[02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:33.600]  search for the grow from your heart podcast, give me a
[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:35.120]  rating that you feel I deserve.
[02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:36.480]  I'm not even asking for five stars.
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:38.440]  I want you to go and click what you feel I deserve.
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:41.160]  After that type in a comment, let me know what you think of the show.
[02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:44.360]  And I will read your comments on a future episode.
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:46.920]  If you've got a product you'd like me to review, or if you would
[02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:49.760]  like to sponsor the podcast, all you've got to do is send me an email.
[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:51.240]  It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:54.080]  I'll get you all of the information that you do need.
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:56.480]  I would love it if you'd follow me on all of the social media.
[02:20:56.880 --> 02:20:57.960]  I am on Facebook.
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:21:00.880]  You can find me at the grow from your heart podcast on Facebook, on Twitter.
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:03.800]  It's at GFYH podcast on Instagram.
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:06.160]  I am using the seed company name.
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:08.280]  It's IRI underscore genetics.
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:12.800]  I recently signed up for a new app known as green door.
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:15.960]  It is a cannabis based app where we post cannabis articles,
[02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:17.920]  photography, cannabis news.
[02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:19.800]  Make sure you check out the green door app.
[02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:22.760]  When you sign up, make sure you use my name as a referral code.
[02:21:22.760 --> 02:21:24.720]  It's IRI underscore genetics.
[02:21:25.120 --> 02:21:28.400]  And I will get some bonus points on the green door app.
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:29.560]  Make sure you sign up, check it out.
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:33.160]  Shout out to my friend Emily for getting me involved in the green door app.
[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:34.200]  I appreciate it.
[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:37.880]  I think that's all I have got for you this week.
[02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:39.640]  I want to give a big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:40.880]  Thanks again for listening.
[02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:44.600]  And until next time, take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:23:43.070 --> 02:23:48.260]  I'm in my room.
[02:23:48.260 --> 02:23:49.500]  In my room.
[02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:50.500]  In my room.
[02:23:50.500 --> 02:23:51.500]  In my room.
[02:23:51.500 --> 02:23:52.500]  Boom, boom.
[02:23:52.500 --> 02:24:20.500]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:21.660]  It's time for episode number one.
[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:23.740]  Thirty two of the grow from your heart podcast.
[02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:27.180]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:27.980]  That's right.
[02:24:27.980 --> 02:24:29.820]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:33.620]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist
[02:24:33.620 --> 02:24:36.380]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:38.860]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:41.380]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rost and Jeff.
[02:24:41.380 --> 02:24:43.220]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[02:24:43.220 --> 02:24:45.100]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you.
[02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:47.500]  Shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use
[02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:49.300]  their music on my podcast.
[02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:52.740]  Big thanks to Kat and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:57.060]  You guys, Mystic Roots is on tour this spring.
[02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:58.740]  They're touring around with Catchafaya.
[02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:01.020]  They're doing five or six shows in Colorado.
[02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:04.500]  I will be at the Colorado Spring Show at the Black Sheep for sure.
[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:06.540]  There's a good chance I'll be at some of the Denver shows.
[02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:09.060]  I cannot commit to any of that right now, but I will definitely be at the show
[02:25:09.060 --> 02:25:10.260]  with the Black Sheep.
[02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:11.260]  Look forward to seeing you there.
[02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:13.420]  I look forward to seeing the Mystic Roots band there.
[02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:15.460]  Everybody stay positive and get down.
[02:25:16.100 --> 02:25:17.420]  All right. Are you guys having a great week?
[02:25:17.420 --> 02:25:18.740]  I am having a wonderful week.
[02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:20.860]  It was hot as shit here today in Colorado.
[02:25:20.860 --> 02:25:22.900]  Today's the hottest day of the year that we've had so far.
[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:25.300]  It hit 80 degrees in Colorado Springs.
[02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:27.700]  It was over 80 degrees today in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:29.420]  That was the first day I got sweaty.
[02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:31.980]  It was the first day I actually got a little bit hot in the large grow.
[02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:33.860]  And I thought, hold the shit, it's warm in here.
[02:25:33.860 --> 02:25:35.140]  So we're off to a good start.
[02:25:35.140 --> 02:25:37.980]  It's time to start making those summer adjustments in your grow rooms.
[02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:40.140]  Start thinking about air conditioning and stuff like that.
[02:25:40.140 --> 02:25:43.580]  You guys, maybe we need to do an episode on doing the season switch.
[02:25:44.420 --> 02:25:47.100]  All right. Let's do let's do some important announcements.
[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:50.540]  You guys, the secret session is coming back to Denver on May 19th.
[02:25:50.540 --> 02:25:52.740]  The secret sesh brought to you by Gatsby Gardens.
[02:25:52.940 --> 02:25:56.260]  If you want more information on the secret session, Denver, Colorado, on May 19th,
[02:25:56.260 --> 02:26:00.060]  all you have to do is follow at Secret Sesh Colorado on Instagram.
[02:26:00.060 --> 02:26:02.220]  That's right. Secret Sesh CEO on the Instagram.
[02:26:02.460 --> 02:26:03.940]  You guys, I cannot get you tickets.
[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:06.220]  I cannot get you passes. I can't get you on the list.
[02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:07.780]  I cannot do anything to help you out.
[02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:10.580]  I am simply blessed to be at the event myself.
[02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:12.020]  I can't help you out.
[02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:14.780]  So all the people that asked me for help, all the people that sent me text messages,
[02:26:14.780 --> 02:26:18.500]  I apologize. I'm telling you right now, I can't do shit to get you into that event.
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:20.220]  So do what you got to do. Get on the list.
[02:26:20.220 --> 02:26:22.060]  Make your reservations. Pay your dues.
[02:26:22.060 --> 02:26:24.060]  I'll see you there. I'll take some fat dabs with you.
[02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:26.140]  Shout out to the Grimy Gatsby for throwing this event.
[02:26:26.140 --> 02:26:28.780]  Also, a huge shout out to Adam Ill for coming from California
[02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:30.900]  to host this event for us.
[02:26:30.900 --> 02:26:32.380]  Much love, much respect to Adam Ill.
[02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:34.620]  Without Adam Ill, this podcast may not have happened.
[02:26:34.620 --> 02:26:37.140]  You guys, Adam Ill kind of inspired me to do a show.
[02:26:38.060 --> 02:26:39.220]  He quit doing a podcast.
[02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:40.060]  I felt an absence.
[02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:42.580]  There were a couple of other podcasts that inspired, but Adam Ill had a huge part.
[02:26:42.580 --> 02:26:44.100]  So big, big respect.
[02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:46.060]  Much love to Adam Ill.
[02:26:46.060 --> 02:26:47.660]  All right, you guys, I'm going to turn down this music here
[02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:50.380]  and we're going to talk a little bit about let's see.
[02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:52.100]  I've been growing in cocoa lately.
[02:26:52.100 --> 02:26:53.060]  I've made the switch.
[02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:56.100]  I ran a few pots at the big grow with nothing but cocoa in there.
[02:26:56.540 --> 02:26:58.940]  And I am really liking it, you guys.
[02:26:58.940 --> 02:27:01.220]  It seems like I'm watering a little bit more frequently.
[02:27:01.220 --> 02:27:04.500]  But one thing I've noticed is that I cannot overwater the plants
[02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:06.220]  that are in the cocoa.
[02:27:06.220 --> 02:27:07.580]  I've been doing a couple of experiments.
[02:27:07.580 --> 02:27:10.180]  I've got one pot set aside from all the other pots.
[02:27:10.180 --> 02:27:14.220]  And when I water, I give this one pot double or triple what every other plant gets.
[02:27:14.420 --> 02:27:17.580]  And it does not ever show signs of stress from being overwatered.
[02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:19.260]  So that's something I like.
[02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:21.620]  There are some times when I know I'm not going to get back to the grow
[02:27:21.620 --> 02:27:22.860]  first thing in the morning.
[02:27:22.860 --> 02:27:25.420]  So I will just heavily, heavily water those plants.
[02:27:26.060 --> 02:27:29.700]  And I felt like when I was running soil, sometimes I would flood those plants
[02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:33.140]  so much that I could see them getting droopy and being angry from being overwatered.
[02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:34.940]  That never happens with the cocoa.
[02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:39.260]  So I'm able to flood these plants and they don't get pissed off from being overwatered.
[02:27:39.260 --> 02:27:42.060]  But it does feel like my regular watering schedule,
[02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:44.100]  I need to hit them a little bit more frequently.
[02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:46.180]  I've had to increase the amount of water that I give them
[02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:48.540]  because they are drying out a little bit more quickly.
[02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:52.220]  One thing I've noticed with cocoa, one thing I should mention with cocoa,
[02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:54.300]  there are no nutrients in cocoa.
[02:27:54.300 --> 02:27:57.180]  If you're just using straight cocoa, there's nothing there to keep your plant going.
[02:27:57.180 --> 02:28:00.260]  So you're going to need to feed it nutrients almost every watering.
[02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:03.100]  I've been giving it lots of nutrients.
[02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:06.700]  So I water the plants twice a day.
[02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:09.820]  I'll do nutrients, nutrients.
[02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:11.740]  That's two waters in one day, nutrients, nutrients.
[02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:14.180]  The next day I'll go nutrients, nutrients, and then I'll go nutrients.
[02:28:14.460 --> 02:28:16.380]  And then the watering before I leave on the third day,
[02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:18.260]  I usually just hit them with clean water.
[02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:19.700]  So they're getting a lot of nutrients.
[02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:21.900]  They don't look, I don't see any deficiencies.
[02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:23.980]  I don't see any overnutrients.
[02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:25.900]  They don't look mad from being overwatered.
[02:28:26.100 --> 02:28:27.740]  I'm really liking the cocoa, you guys.
[02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:29.820]  One thing I should mention, don't let your cocoa dry out.
[02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:32.060]  Once you see the top layer of cocoa drying out,
[02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:35.060]  that's when you're in danger of your plants getting a little bit too dry.
[02:28:35.060 --> 02:28:37.060]  It happens very quickly in cocoa.
[02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:40.700]  The time frame when you walk in to a soil grow and you see your plants drooping,
[02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:42.460]  they're kind of starting to get pissed off.
[02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:44.500]  If they're drooping in cocoa, they're fucking angry.
[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:45.420]  That's one thing I've noticed.
[02:28:45.420 --> 02:28:46.700]  I've been doing some experiments
[02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:48.940]  and I'm learning so that you guys don't have to kill plants to learn.
[02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:50.940]  I've got more access. I've got more space.
[02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:53.660]  So we're learning with cocoa. I really do like it.
[02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:56.740]  This kind of segues into something else I want to talk about.
[02:28:58.660 --> 02:29:01.980]  Overwatering, I see a lot of people and a lot of grows overwatering
[02:29:01.980 --> 02:29:05.380]  their plants and they're wondering why the growth of their plant is stunted.
[02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:09.900]  There's something that happens when the soil starts to dry out a little bit
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:12.180]  or when your medium starts to dry out a bit.
[02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:16.780]  The moisture to oxygen ratio in there really makes your roots want to grow.
[02:29:17.020 --> 02:29:18.620]  It really makes your roots want to eat.
[02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:20.100]  So they start searching for nutrients.
[02:29:20.100 --> 02:29:21.180]  They start growing a little bit.
[02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:23.260]  This really makes your plants get active.
[02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:28.820]  I have noticed that when I used to run clones in root cubes or rock wool,
[02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:31.580]  I would notice that my clones would actually root the best
[02:29:31.620 --> 02:29:35.900]  when I would forget about them and the rock wool cube would dry up a little bit.
[02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:39.300]  I really think that that dryness is what the plants are looking for.
[02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:41.220]  A little bit more than the wetness.
[02:29:41.260 --> 02:29:43.460]  They don't want to be soggy all the time.
[02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:47.940]  So it's kind of a good idea to give your plants a short dry out period.
[02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:51.340]  You don't want them getting wilty and crispy, but keep an eye on your plant.
[02:29:51.340 --> 02:29:54.300]  Water your plants thoroughly and then keep an eye on them and watch.
[02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:56.540]  You'll see right when they start to droop a little bit,
[02:29:56.580 --> 02:29:57.900]  that's when you need to give them water.
[02:29:57.900 --> 02:30:01.340]  So start learning right before that happens and then start feeding them
[02:30:01.700 --> 02:30:03.660]  right before that, right before they start to droop.
[02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:05.420]  That's when you should be giving them water every time
[02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:07.140]  so that you allow that dry out phase.
[02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:10.140]  Something that happens in that dry out phase that we've talked about
[02:30:10.140 --> 02:30:12.180]  on this podcast several episodes back,
[02:30:12.940 --> 02:30:15.660]  as the moisture level in your root zone changes,
[02:30:15.780 --> 02:30:18.620]  as the water level in your soil ball in your cocoa area,
[02:30:18.620 --> 02:30:21.820]  as that moisture level changes, so will the pH.
[02:30:22.140 --> 02:30:27.300]  So if you're feeding your plants a nutrient solution that's real high in pH,
[02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:28.100]  you pour it in there,
[02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:31.620]  only certain nutrients are going to be available at that pH level.
[02:30:32.020 --> 02:30:36.540]  But as the moisture level and temperature change inside of that soil ball,
[02:30:36.540 --> 02:30:39.780]  inside that rhizosphere, inside your pot and your container there,
[02:30:40.380 --> 02:30:44.980]  the pH will change and different nutrients will become bioavailable to your plants.
[02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:48.740]  So there are several advantages to letting your plants dry out just a little bit.
[02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:50.100]  I don't want you to let them get crispy,
[02:30:50.700 --> 02:30:52.940]  but it is good for your plants to dry out just a little bit.
[02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:54.380]  You'll see much more production.
[02:30:55.100 --> 02:31:00.100]  This is why I like to put my mother plants in root pots or air pots or earth pots,
[02:31:00.700 --> 02:31:02.980]  any type of fabric pot that they can breathe a whole bunch,
[02:31:03.620 --> 02:31:05.980]  or they make those plastic pots that have a bunch of holes in them that have
[02:31:05.980 --> 02:31:07.420]  like the dimple shapes on them.
[02:31:08.380 --> 02:31:12.380]  I really like that because I feel like your roots get a lot of oxygen.
[02:31:12.780 --> 02:31:14.420]  And then if you're using that in cocoa,
[02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:17.820]  your roots are going to be surrounded by oxygen and they're going to grow
[02:31:17.820 --> 02:31:19.740]  rapidly and your plants will love it.
[02:31:19.780 --> 02:31:24.340]  So that is my take on cocoa and kind of a segue into letting your plants dry out
[02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:27.060]  a little bit. I love cocoa. You got to use more nutrients.
[02:31:27.740 --> 02:31:31.580]  You definitely need more cow and more mag with cocoa, more cow mag,
[02:31:32.140 --> 02:31:33.220]  heavily with cocoa.
[02:31:33.700 --> 02:31:37.060]  And then if you're using soil or cocoa or a soil,
[02:31:37.060 --> 02:31:40.820]  this makes us a good idea to kind of let your plants dry up just a little bit.
[02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:41.020]  All right.
[02:31:41.020 --> 02:31:45.020]  That was a quick talk quick ramble about how I feel about cocoa and what I've
[02:31:45.020 --> 02:31:47.260]  learned about letting the plants dry a little bit.
[02:31:47.780 --> 02:31:51.380]  So let's move into the next part. I want to talk about collecting pollen.
[02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:53.580]  You guys, yesterday I spent a couple of hours,
[02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:56.820]  working with a male plant. If you've been following my social media,
[02:31:56.820 --> 02:32:00.500]  you know that I've got an Arise male from Arise F1 seed.
[02:32:00.500 --> 02:32:03.300]  He is a male plant that looks like a true stud. He plans,
[02:32:03.620 --> 02:32:05.620]  I plan on using him as my breeding stud.
[02:32:06.380 --> 02:32:10.340]  I took him to about eight weeks of flower in a flowering room to see what he
[02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:13.700]  would do. And yesterday I cut him down. But before I did, I collected the pollen.
[02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:18.140]  Now here is how I collected the pollen. There are several methods to doing this.
[02:32:18.140 --> 02:32:20.940]  I actually used a couple of different techniques to see what I liked better,
[02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:23.140]  just because I wanted to talk about it on the show.
[02:32:23.780 --> 02:32:24.860]  The way I started, you guys,
[02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:28.500]  I was holding a Mason jar and I was just going to the bottom buds and I grabbed
[02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:29.780]  a drumstick because I'm a drummer.
[02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:34.020]  I grabbed a drumstick and I was just tapping the male buds over the jar and
[02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:37.500]  pollen was falling into the jar and I liked it. It was working,
[02:32:37.500 --> 02:32:40.340]  but I felt that a bunch of the pollen was missing the jars.
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:43.660]  I was tapping the bud. Pollen was falling down the side of the jar.
[02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:45.020]  Pollen was falling on my hand.
[02:32:45.580 --> 02:32:47.620]  The side of the bud that didn't have a jar near it,
[02:32:47.620 --> 02:32:49.300]  there was just pollen falling onto the floor.
[02:32:49.860 --> 02:32:52.460]  There was plenty of pollen collected, but I felt like I was wasting a lot.
[02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:55.460]  I had this jar and I'm just tapping buds and I'm tapping the buds,
[02:32:55.460 --> 02:32:56.940]  the pollen into the jar. I got a lot.
[02:32:57.900 --> 02:33:02.540]  The next method that I tried was I cut the buds off of the plant and I just laid
[02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:03.820]  the male flowers,
[02:33:03.820 --> 02:33:08.020]  the buds with the male flowers onto a glass tray.
[02:33:08.540 --> 02:33:10.420]  Then I was just tapping them with my finger.
[02:33:11.100 --> 02:33:14.380]  What I was noticing was a bunch more pollen was falling off and landing
[02:33:14.380 --> 02:33:16.620]  directly onto the tray and I wasn't losing as much.
[02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:20.700]  The only problem there was I was gathering a whole bunch of male flowers.
[02:33:21.140 --> 02:33:25.620]  What I had to do was sift out the male flowers from the pollen because you don't
[02:33:25.620 --> 02:33:26.900]  want to leave those male flowers in there.
[02:33:26.900 --> 02:33:28.700]  If you store it with those male flowers in there,
[02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:32.700]  there is a chance that those male flowers have moisture in them and they will
[02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:36.820]  mildew up inside of your jar. Moisture is one of your biggest enemies to pollen.
[02:33:36.820 --> 02:33:38.420]  We're going to talk about that here in just a minute.
[02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:42.980]  What I found to be the most successful was chopping the tops.
[02:33:43.100 --> 02:33:46.300]  I just chopped the top right off the male plant and I set it on a glass tray and
[02:33:46.300 --> 02:33:48.740]  just tapped it. I just tapped it for a couple of good minutes.
[02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:52.380]  I was tapping it kind of hard and then I could just see the pollen falling out of
[02:33:52.380 --> 02:33:54.580]  the buds. Then I turned it over and did it again.
[02:33:55.020 --> 02:33:57.740]  Then I picked it up and kind of tapped it with my finger to knock off any pollen
[02:33:57.740 --> 02:34:01.820]  that's stuck. Then I just threw that big old pollen. What did I do?
[02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:05.180]  Just pollen removed bud, just threw that part right into the trash.
[02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:09.660]  I felt that setting it on the tray and tapping it was my best method for
[02:34:09.660 --> 02:34:13.140]  collecting pollen. However, I did get all those male plants. I just used,
[02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:14.620]  I felt kind of sketchy,
[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:19.620]  but I just used an old ID on a plate and just separated the male flowers from
[02:34:19.620 --> 02:34:20.460]  the pollen.
[02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:23.580]  It kind of felt like a cross between when you used to pick seeds out of
[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:26.860]  shwagweed and also when you used to use a credit card to do bad drugs.
[02:34:26.860 --> 02:34:30.460]  It's kind of what it felt like. I was a weird feeling, but it was definitely,
[02:34:30.900 --> 02:34:32.300]  it worked. It worked very well.
[02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:37.020]  I've got a mason jar with a nice two inch layer of a rise pollen in the bottom
[02:34:37.020 --> 02:34:39.580]  of it. I do plan on making some crosses with the rise.
[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:43.180]  I also plan on making a rise F2 in the future here.
[02:34:43.220 --> 02:34:46.820]  So look out for some seeds coming up from iRegenetics in the very near future.
[02:34:46.820 --> 02:34:47.740]  I'll need some testers.
[02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:50.100]  I need you guys to run those for me and tell me what they do.
[02:34:51.540 --> 02:34:53.660]  I'm going to get a bunch of messages from people that want to be testers.
[02:34:53.780 --> 02:34:56.500]  That's cool. I can deal with that. I'm very selective on testers, you guys.
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:34:57.860]  So when it comes time to test seeds,
[02:34:57.980 --> 02:35:00.940]  you need to have an impressive resume if you want to be a tester for me,
[02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:02.980]  because I need to know what's truly going on with these plants.
[02:35:02.980 --> 02:35:06.980]  I need reliable testers. When the time comes, I will talk about that on the show.
[02:35:06.980 --> 02:35:09.100]  It's not time for testers yet. All right.
[02:35:09.100 --> 02:35:11.820]  Another method that I was using to try to collect the pollen that I didn't find
[02:35:11.820 --> 02:35:14.900]  to be very successful was I was cutting the branch off that had the male flowers
[02:35:14.900 --> 02:35:18.460]  on it and just cutting it into six or eight inch sections and holding,
[02:35:18.820 --> 02:35:22.100]  actually kind of dipping that into a Mason jar and then tapping it at the base
[02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:23.780]  of the stalk. And it was working,
[02:35:23.780 --> 02:35:26.780]  but I was not able to knock off enough pollen to make it worth my time.
[02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:30.020]  And it was also knocking off a bunch of male flowers into the Mason jar,
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:33.060]  which meant that I had to pour that back out onto the plate anyway to sift it.
[02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:36.340]  So it wasn't really, I didn't find it to be effective.
[02:35:36.340 --> 02:35:39.220]  So I think the best method was to put,
[02:35:39.380 --> 02:35:42.860]  if you've got a giant mirror or if you're a drummer and you've got an old kick
[02:35:42.860 --> 02:35:44.580]  drum head, just drop a nug,
[02:35:44.860 --> 02:35:47.700]  the male plant right down onto the giant mirror and just tap on it.
[02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:51.140]  And then all the pollen will fall off and then use a credit card or an old ID
[02:35:51.140 --> 02:35:53.580]  just to scrape it up. It's easy to collect pollen.
[02:35:53.580 --> 02:35:56.820]  So once you've got your pollen, you're going to need to store your pollen.
[02:35:56.940 --> 02:35:58.620]  I recommend putting it in a Mason jar.
[02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:02.140]  And then I like to put that Mason jar in a brown paper bag to keep it dark.
[02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:04.860]  And then I put all of that inside of the refrigerator.
[02:36:05.460 --> 02:36:08.820]  Carefully label your jars of pollen. You guys, that's really important.
[02:36:08.820 --> 02:36:12.940]  My jar says a rise F one pollen collected five, five,
[02:36:12.940 --> 02:36:16.220]  16. That's easy enough. I know that that's a rise pollen.
[02:36:16.260 --> 02:36:18.100]  And I know when it was collected. Uh,
[02:36:18.140 --> 02:36:20.460]  I've never really tried to store pollen for too long.
[02:36:20.460 --> 02:36:21.940]  I always use it kind of soon.
[02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:26.860]  I could imagine it would last a few months maybe, but I'm honestly not sure.
[02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:31.220]  If it's properly stored six months, maybe a year. I don't want to lie to you.
[02:36:31.620 --> 02:36:33.140]  Uh, if you've got information on how long,
[02:36:33.140 --> 02:36:37.140]  if you've had pollen stored for a long time and you used it and it worked, uh,
[02:36:37.140 --> 02:36:39.380]  send me an email, grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[02:36:39.420 --> 02:36:43.700]  I want to hear your pollen methods on how long and how you apply pollen.
[02:36:43.700 --> 02:36:46.900]  I want to know how long you keep it before you apply it and what the oldest
[02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:50.380]  viable pollen you ever had was. That's what I want to know. All right.
[02:36:50.380 --> 02:36:52.940]  So you've collected a bunch of pollen. You've got it in a Mason jar.
[02:36:53.180 --> 02:36:55.620]  It's well-labeled. It's been stored in the fridge for a little bit.
[02:36:55.620 --> 02:36:56.900]  Here's something I must mention.
[02:36:57.460 --> 02:37:00.420]  Do not get your pollen wet in any way, shape or form.
[02:37:00.860 --> 02:37:05.060]  Moisture is pollen's worst enemy. A lot of people ask me, they're like, bro,
[02:37:05.100 --> 02:37:08.340]  you breed and you grow seedless flowers in the same facility.
[02:37:08.780 --> 02:37:12.740]  Aren't you scared having that male flower around or that male plant around that's
[02:37:12.740 --> 02:37:15.860]  just spitting pollen? Aren't you worried about seeding up all of your females?
[02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:18.940]  Um, sometimes shit happens.
[02:37:19.900 --> 02:37:22.860]  Sometimes I've grown crops that were meant to be seedless and I've accidentally
[02:37:22.860 --> 02:37:25.700]  discovered a whole bunch of seeds in there and it was because it had a male
[02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:28.380]  plant in the same area and it just got cross pollinated.
[02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:32.700]  But the secret is water deactivates pollen, you guys.
[02:37:33.180 --> 02:37:38.020]  So I've got two separate areas. One's got a male plant, one's got female plants.
[02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:41.580]  The female plants are in flower and completely able to accept pollen.
[02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:44.380]  They're still in their ovulation phase. They can accept pollen.
[02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:47.420]  They can make seeds. They can become seeded. They can,
[02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:50.140]  they're going to grow long enough to make viable seed.
[02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:53.340]  The way that I prevent them from being seeded when I mess with my male plant.
[02:37:53.340 --> 02:37:57.740]  So yesterday I was playing with a male plant about 30 feet away from those
[02:37:57.740 --> 02:38:00.820]  female plants. What I did was I took a, uh,
[02:38:00.860 --> 02:38:04.060]  like my backpack sprayer that I would apply pesticides or foliar feed in there.
[02:38:04.140 --> 02:38:06.540]  I just mixed up some water in there. Just straight clean water.
[02:38:06.580 --> 02:38:10.740]  I pH it at 6.5 and I sprayed that all over my female plants.
[02:38:11.140 --> 02:38:13.740]  And then I went and I played with my male plant in a separate area.
[02:38:14.100 --> 02:38:16.780]  I collected all the pollen from him. Then I cleaned up,
[02:38:17.140 --> 02:38:20.340]  I threw away all the trash and threw away the pot. I threw away, not the pot,
[02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:23.780]  but like the container. I threw away the container. I threw away all the dirt.
[02:38:23.780 --> 02:38:26.780]  I cleaned up, I swept up that room. I cleaned up the room where the male was.
[02:38:27.460 --> 02:38:30.540]  Then I took the clothes that I was wearing and I walked straight to a washing
[02:38:30.580 --> 02:38:33.900]  machine. I took the clothes off and threw them into a washing machine.
[02:38:34.420 --> 02:38:38.260]  Then I walked myself directly to a shower and I hosed myself down,
[02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:40.060]  including you guys.
[02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:44.300]  I am six foot five and I have got dreadlocks almost to my knees. My,
[02:38:44.340 --> 02:38:48.620]  my dreadlocks are mid thigh region and I had to run to a shower and just rinse my
[02:38:48.620 --> 02:38:51.460]  whole self down. So I had to go wash the dreads. I had to go wash the beard.
[02:38:51.780 --> 02:38:52.900]  Just went and scrub myself.
[02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:58.660]  I feel that the water I applied to those female plants made them unable.
[02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:01.780]  It was a little bit of birth control. It made them unable to collect pollen.
[02:39:02.020 --> 02:39:05.780]  The pollen was not allowed to land on the pistol and move into the ovule because
[02:39:05.780 --> 02:39:06.900]  the water was in the way.
[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:11.060]  I also feel that any water or any pollen that was on myself or my clothes was
[02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:12.700]  destroyed as soon as it hit the water.
[02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:15.060]  I carried those clothes up to the washing machine.
[02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:16.980]  I threw them in the washing machine, turn on the water.
[02:39:17.740 --> 02:39:20.340]  Even the hat that I was wearing got thrown into that washing machine.
[02:39:20.380 --> 02:39:22.620]  So all the clothes got washed and the hat got washed.
[02:39:22.860 --> 02:39:25.060]  Then the dreadlocks got washed. I got washed.
[02:39:25.580 --> 02:39:29.620]  Uh, and then before I went back into the grow room with the females,
[02:39:29.620 --> 02:39:33.580]  I went and grabbed my sprayer again and I sprayed it in front of me as I walked
[02:39:33.580 --> 02:39:34.300]  into that room.
[02:39:34.300 --> 02:39:38.060]  So there was water landing on those plants before I got into there is kind of
[02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:42.300]  what I was aiming for. I'm pretty sure that these plants will not be seeded.
[02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:45.180]  The female plants that I was messing with. And yesterday,
[02:39:45.180 --> 02:39:47.860]  after I played with my male plant, I went and took pictures of the girls.
[02:39:48.180 --> 02:39:52.780]  I am 99% sure that I did not seed them. It's all about water. You guys,
[02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:57.660]  uh, I have seen people set up a screen, like a screen door.
[02:39:57.660 --> 02:40:00.500]  So you open up your grow room door and then there's a screen door and they've
[02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:02.620]  got water running down that screen door.
[02:40:02.940 --> 02:40:06.140]  There's a little Mr. Spring water right at the top and it collects on the screen
[02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:08.540]  and runs down. That is their pollen catch.
[02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:12.660]  They also sell a UV light that will kill pollen that goes in your ducting.
[02:40:12.660 --> 02:40:16.220]  So if pollen comes in, it goes through this UV light,
[02:40:16.220 --> 02:40:18.300]  that goes through your ducting and then it is just killed right there.
[02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:19.140]  It's neutralized.
[02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:23.020]  So pollen isn't as scary as a lot of people like to think water will destroy
[02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:25.700]  pollen. If you're afraid of pollinating your plants,
[02:40:25.700 --> 02:40:29.180]  just apply a little bit of water and you should be safe. All right.
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:32.420]  If you guys are playing with pollen and female plants and male plants in a,
[02:40:32.740 --> 02:40:36.260]  in a small area, in a house, in a home grow the first couple of times,
[02:40:36.340 --> 02:40:37.780]  expect to get some seeds.
[02:40:38.140 --> 02:40:42.060]  It takes one little tiny speck of pollen to make a seed and pollen is so tiny.
[02:40:42.060 --> 02:40:45.100]  You can't get it all off of you unless you kind of have some experience and you
[02:40:45.100 --> 02:40:45.860]  know what you're doing.
[02:40:45.860 --> 02:40:49.380]  So don't be surprised if you pollinate your crop on accident,
[02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:52.500]  you guys have been going for 17 minutes now and you can hear the dryness in my
[02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:55.820]  throat. So I'm gonna take a quick drink and a couple of dabs and I will be right
[02:40:55.820 --> 02:40:59.580]  back. All right, I am back.
[02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:01.700]  I'm well hydrated and well medicated.
[02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:04.020]  I need to give a huge shout out to my friends at Turpex.
[02:41:04.180 --> 02:41:05.980]  Big shout out to the whole Turpex crew right now.
[02:41:05.980 --> 02:41:08.580]  I am dabbing some cactus cookies cream.
[02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:11.860]  A shatter made by the friends at Turpex and this stuff tastes delicious.
[02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:15.540]  Great work you guys. Also props to the grower, whoever grew this, it was not me.
[02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:18.940]  I'm not bragging. Whoever did the growing here, they did a really nice job.
[02:41:18.940 --> 02:41:22.220]  So great work, great concentrates. You can always pick up your Turpex shatter,
[02:41:22.420 --> 02:41:25.900]  your Turpex live resin, your Turpex waxes, your Turpex butters.
[02:41:25.900 --> 02:41:29.380]  You can get your Turpex products at Green and Healthy Wellness at 430 West
[02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:32.300]  Colorado and Colorado Springs. Make sure you check that out.
[02:41:32.340 --> 02:41:33.580]  It is a medical only facility.
[02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:37.940]  So you do need your medical marijuana recommendation to shop there. All right.
[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:40.540]  Many of you may know that I am a consultant. I do consulting.
[02:41:40.540 --> 02:41:44.180]  I help people build grow rooms. I help them get their grow rooms going. Uh,
[02:41:44.180 --> 02:41:47.220]  if you have a problem in your grow, you can contact me, pay me a small fee.
[02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:50.460]  I will come to your garden and check out your grow and tell you what's going on
[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:53.380]  and tell you what's wrong and help you correct and improve your grow.
[02:41:53.860 --> 02:41:57.780]  So recently I was called to a place where this guy had powdery mildew and he
[02:41:57.780 --> 02:42:00.940]  could not figure out what was causing the powdery mildew. Uh,
[02:42:00.940 --> 02:42:04.740]  the problem was that he was not getting rid of his old stale air.
[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:06.060]  I talk about this a lot.
[02:42:06.060 --> 02:42:08.980]  You need to remove the stagnant air from your grow room.
[02:42:08.980 --> 02:42:10.540]  You need to get rid of that extra humidity.
[02:42:10.540 --> 02:42:11.900]  You need to get rid of that old moisture.
[02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:14.060]  You need to get it out of the room and get some fresh air in there.
[02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:18.140]  This guy is failing to do that in his area and he is getting powdery mildew.
[02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:21.140]  We've tried a few things to get rid of the powdery mildew.
[02:42:21.780 --> 02:42:24.260]  We've applied a couple of products that seem to be working,
[02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:28.220]  but unfortunately he had to harvest a little bit early because the PM was
[02:42:28.220 --> 02:42:30.020]  overtaking a couple of plants.
[02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:33.700]  So let me tell you a little bit about what we tried to get rid of this powdery
[02:42:33.700 --> 02:42:36.900]  mildew. A while back when I first discovered the powdery mildew in this guy's
[02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:41.580]  garden, I started applying a product called stylet oil. It's JMS stylet oil.
[02:42:41.900 --> 02:42:45.780]  It seemed to be working very well. It was knocking the PM off of the leaves.
[02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:48.740]  We couldn't see any on there. It wouldn't come back for quite some time,
[02:42:49.060 --> 02:42:52.220]  but we had to keep spraying it about once a week to keep the PM away.
[02:42:52.700 --> 02:42:55.660]  And I really didn't want to spray this stuff on heavy,
[02:42:55.660 --> 02:42:58.660]  chunky buds because I could tell it was leaving a little bit of an oil on the
[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:01.980]  plants, which was actually the main ingredient that was stopping the PM.
[02:43:02.300 --> 02:43:05.500]  I just didn't want to put this oil all over his buds. So I didn't like spraying it.
[02:43:06.060 --> 02:43:10.420]  I researched another product and I was recommended big time exterminator.
[02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:15.620]  A big time exterminator is 90 or is mostly a citric acid or citric oil.
[02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:17.420]  I don't remember which one it is. I think it's citric acid.
[02:43:17.940 --> 02:43:20.940]  And it works very well at keeping insects away.
[02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:22.540]  It makes the plants look really good.
[02:43:22.820 --> 02:43:25.300]  And it also took the powdery mildew off of the plants.
[02:43:25.700 --> 02:43:26.340]  Unfortunately,
[02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:29.740]  this product only works to keep the powdery mildew at bay for about three to
[02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:32.820]  five days at a time before we would start seeing little speckles pop up.
[02:43:33.700 --> 02:43:37.420]  It was getting closer to harvest and I wanted to try something a little bit more
[02:43:38.220 --> 02:43:41.500]  extreme. We were ready to go extreme. We did not want to use Eagle 20.
[02:43:41.980 --> 02:43:46.300]  I am trying to only use products that are allowed by the MED in my personal grow
[02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:50.060]  and in my caregiver grows and in my consultant grows just because it's easier to
[02:43:50.060 --> 02:43:53.220]  have one playing field. So we will not use Eagle 20 in this garden.
[02:43:54.180 --> 02:43:59.180]  What I did use was I got 30% hydrogen peroxide and I filled up a four gallon
[02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:04.660]  pump sprayer and I put a 20 milliliters per gallon of 30% hydrogen peroxide in
[02:44:05.660 --> 02:44:10.060]  this water and I adjusted the pH and I soaked all of the plants with this
[02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:15.020]  hydrogen peroxide solution and it took off most of the powdery mildew and it did
[02:44:15.020 --> 02:44:15.860]  not come back.
[02:44:16.180 --> 02:44:19.540]  Unfortunately there was one plant in the back corner where the powdery mildew had
[02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:22.220]  kind of taken over and I didn't see it was so bad back there.
[02:44:22.220 --> 02:44:26.060]  I didn't spray enough. It did not take off the powdery mildew on one plant.
[02:44:26.540 --> 02:44:30.620]  So my friend harvested most of his plants didn't show signs of powdery mildew.
[02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:34.820]  This one plant that did have powdery mildew, I found a solution online.
[02:44:34.820 --> 02:44:37.060]  My friend Jorge Cervantes taught us about this.
[02:44:37.420 --> 02:44:41.940]  I took a five gallon bucket and I put 50 milliliters of the 30% hydrogen
[02:44:41.940 --> 02:44:44.660]  peroxide in the bucket. You guys, whenever you're at, let me,
[02:44:44.700 --> 02:44:45.860]  let me back up a little bit.
[02:44:45.860 --> 02:44:48.060]  Whenever you were messing with this hydrogen peroxide,
[02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:52.060]  be sure to wear rubber gloves. You need some latex gloves.
[02:44:52.060 --> 02:44:54.340]  You don't want to get this stuff on your fingers. It'll burn your fingers.
[02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:57.940]  Depending on what kind of skin you've got, it could mess up your fingers.
[02:44:57.940 --> 02:45:00.620]  I'm a white guy. I dribbled some on my fingers.
[02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:02.500]  It made my fingers look bleached white.
[02:45:03.020 --> 02:45:05.740]  I imagine if you don't have working hands,
[02:45:05.740 --> 02:45:07.460]  if you've got some softer, more gentle hands,
[02:45:07.500 --> 02:45:09.460]  it probably could burn your skin pretty well.
[02:45:09.460 --> 02:45:12.540]  So make sure you wear gloves when you're using the hydrogen peroxide.
[02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:16.180]  So mix your 50 mils of hydrogen peroxide into five,
[02:45:16.260 --> 02:45:19.580]  a five gallon bucket of water. And you guys, this may sound crazy,
[02:45:19.740 --> 02:45:23.540]  but I chopped the buds off of this plant and I was dunking them directly into
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:26.900]  the water and swishing them around for about five to seven seconds.
[02:45:26.900 --> 02:45:30.180]  Just swishing it under the water with the peroxide in there. Let me back up.
[02:45:30.500 --> 02:45:33.660]  I would cut off most of the leaf, you guys, most of the larger leaf.
[02:45:33.660 --> 02:45:36.700]  I'd give it a little pre-trim and then I would dunk the bud into the hydrogen
[02:45:36.700 --> 02:45:40.020]  peroxide. And then I was hanging it on a line with a flat fan,
[02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:44.100]  an oscillating fan blowing near it constantly to dry these buds out as quickly,
[02:45:44.420 --> 02:45:47.220]  not dry them, but to get them water out of them as quickly as possible.
[02:45:47.540 --> 02:45:49.340]  I left the fan on there for two to three hours.
[02:45:49.980 --> 02:45:50.940]  And then toward the end of the day,
[02:45:50.980 --> 02:45:53.540]  I just turned the fan to where it wasn't blowing directly on them.
[02:45:53.580 --> 02:45:55.060]  And I gave all the buds a squeeze.
[02:45:55.380 --> 02:45:59.220]  I cannot tell the difference between the buds that I dunked in the solution and
[02:45:59.220 --> 02:46:02.820]  the buds that were not dunked. The best part is the buds I dunked,
[02:46:02.980 --> 02:46:05.260]  shows zero signs of powdery mildew.
[02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:08.100]  I don't know if this is something you want to try at home.
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:11.540]  This is not something I would do in my garden, but I saw it work, you guys.
[02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:14.580]  And when I smoke this product, it's not ready to smoke yet.
[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:15.780]  It'll be ready in a couple of days.
[02:46:16.180 --> 02:46:20.860]  I am 90% sure that I'm not going to notice any of the peroxide solution in these
[02:46:20.860 --> 02:46:24.060]  flowers. So it may sound completely crazy,
[02:46:24.620 --> 02:46:27.140]  but if you've got a plant that's got to be harvested and it's got a little bit
[02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:30.780]  of powdery mildew on it, the best solution is to get a five gallon bucket,
[02:46:31.060 --> 02:46:34.260]  some water and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide and go ahead and dunk those
[02:46:34.260 --> 02:46:37.420]  buds in there. Leave them in there for five or six seconds, pull them out,
[02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:41.100]  hang them up, put a fan on them and try to start getting them dry safely.
[02:46:41.380 --> 02:46:44.580]  And then from once they get dried out from that water, you just put in there,
[02:46:44.660 --> 02:46:46.220]  you're just drying them just like normal.
[02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:49.620]  You would dry and cure them just like any other flowers that you've cut down.
[02:46:49.620 --> 02:46:52.660]  So I hope that helps save your crop. The most important part, you guys,
[02:46:52.660 --> 02:46:55.860]  if you're getting powdery mildew, you need to correct the issue in your grow room.
[02:46:55.860 --> 02:46:57.940]  Something is causing that powdery mildew to happen.
[02:46:58.460 --> 02:47:00.340]  You are not getting enough airflow in there.
[02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:04.580]  I highly recommend heavily defoliating your plants. Take off all the extra leaf.
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:08.340]  That will prevent PM. There will be less surface area for the PM to build up on.
[02:47:08.700 --> 02:47:11.020]  If you've got two leaves that are on top of each other,
[02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:12.580]  one leaf lays on top of another,
[02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:16.220]  and you get that little water layer underneath there that will eventually turn
[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:19.420]  into powdery mildew. Uh, your plants are sweating on top of each other.
[02:47:19.660 --> 02:47:22.980]  And that sweaty space is the perfect environment to create some PM.
[02:47:23.820 --> 02:47:25.900]  Also another thing that we are experimenting with,
[02:47:25.940 --> 02:47:27.700]  I need to get with my friend that's got this product,
[02:47:27.700 --> 02:47:30.660]  but he recently bought the clean light. What the clean light is.
[02:47:30.660 --> 02:47:35.180]  It is a UV light that is designed for the strawberry industry and the pumpkin
[02:47:35.180 --> 02:47:39.420]  industry because strawberries and pumpkins apparently get powdery mildew very
[02:47:39.420 --> 02:47:39.820]  heavily.
[02:47:39.820 --> 02:47:43.380]  So they take this light and they hold it three to four inches above the plants
[02:47:43.380 --> 02:47:45.460]  and they just move this ultraviolet light around.
[02:47:45.460 --> 02:47:48.340]  And this light supposedly kills powdery mildew.
[02:47:48.660 --> 02:47:50.820]  My friend just got it. He's only used it a few times.
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:53.980]  They say it takes about a week of constant use of consistent use to get rid of
[02:47:53.980 --> 02:47:54.820]  the PM.
[02:47:55.020 --> 02:47:58.460]  But I will check with him in a few days and we will see if this has cured his
[02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:02.380]  powdery mildew problem. Hey guys, since I'm talking about PM, uh,
[02:48:02.380 --> 02:48:03.340]  I have a theory.
[02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:08.300]  I feel like CBD rich plants seem to be more susceptible to powdery mildew.
[02:48:09.100 --> 02:48:12.260]  I think there's something in the THC that gives it resistance to PM.
[02:48:12.740 --> 02:48:15.180]  And I do plan on talking to Fox a little bit more about this.
[02:48:15.180 --> 02:48:19.340]  So the next time I have Fox on that will definitely be one of my topics.
[02:48:19.860 --> 02:48:21.580]  So Fox, we got to get you on the show soon, bro.
[02:48:21.580 --> 02:48:25.180]  Also the guys from the Colorado podcast, this is the second time I told you,
[02:48:25.180 --> 02:48:26.020]  we got to get you on the show.
[02:48:26.540 --> 02:48:30.020]  We got to get Jesse and his crew back in here to do another outdoor grow lesson
