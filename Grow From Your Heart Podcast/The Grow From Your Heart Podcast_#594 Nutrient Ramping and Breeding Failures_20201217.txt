[00:00.320 --> 00:02.440]  All right, here we go.
[00:02.440 --> 00:04.040]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:04.040 --> 00:05.040]  I'm your host.
[00:05.040 --> 00:10.520]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 594 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:10.520 --> 00:13.560]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about failed breeding projects.
[00:13.560 --> 00:17.320]  I'm also going to talk about nutrient spiking toward the end of flower.
[00:17.320 --> 00:20.360]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the folks who support the
[00:20.360 --> 00:22.520]  show on Patreon.
[00:22.520 --> 00:24.640]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:24.640 --> 00:25.640]  Thank you.
[00:25.640 --> 00:26.640]  Shout out to my friend, Gramps Memel.
[00:26.640 --> 00:28.200]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Blackbird76.
[00:29.200 --> 00:32.160]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Pac Northwest Dan.
[00:32.160 --> 00:34.160]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Ned Denver.
[00:34.160 --> 00:36.560]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to Matt H.
[00:36.560 --> 00:40.360]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to Tartan Mike.
[00:40.360 --> 00:42.720]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Captain Mojo.
[00:42.720 --> 00:45.520]  I've always got a thank you shout out for my friend, Green Tongue.
[00:45.520 --> 00:48.080]  Let's send a thank you shout out to DTom420.
[00:48.080 --> 00:52.880]  And last, but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you
[00:52.880 --> 00:56.080]  shout out to my friend, Ziggy's Garden.
[00:56.120 --> 00:59.880]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[00:59.880 --> 01:03.160]  If you are not already supporting the show and you'd like to learn how to do so, all
[01:03.160 --> 01:09.160]  you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:09.160 --> 01:11.440]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:11.440 --> 01:15.640]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes and the video description to make
[01:15.640 --> 01:19.160]  it super easy for all of my friends.
[01:19.160 --> 01:23.760]  Speaking of Patreon, Patreon was broken for a couple of days, and it kept telling me that
[01:23.760 --> 01:26.480]  I had 99 unread messages.
[01:26.480 --> 01:30.240]  I think I have caught up and answered all of my Patreon messages at the time of this
[01:30.240 --> 01:31.240]  recording.
[01:31.240 --> 01:35.440]  If you feel like I have not read your message or answered your question, please resend your
[01:35.440 --> 01:36.440]  question.
[01:36.440 --> 01:37.440]  Give me a little reminder.
[01:37.440 --> 01:38.440]  Give me a little nudge.
[01:38.440 --> 01:39.760]  I will get your question on the show.
[01:39.760 --> 01:41.360]  I will answer your message.
[01:41.360 --> 01:43.160]  I do apologize.
[01:43.160 --> 01:47.080]  Patreon was tripping for a couple of days, and I'm trying to catch up and correct all
[01:47.080 --> 01:48.080]  of that.
[01:48.080 --> 01:52.440]  If I missed you, please just reach out again, and I promise you I will get back to you.
[01:52.560 --> 01:54.560]  Alright, also, one more correction.
[01:54.560 --> 01:59.520]  I was listening to the Dude Grows show with Scotty Real, the dude, and of course Guru
[01:59.520 --> 02:04.840]  holding it down, and Scotty Real did mention that I got a lung infection from mixing soil
[02:04.840 --> 02:06.440]  with guano in it.
[02:06.440 --> 02:08.760]  However, that was not me that that happened to.
[02:08.760 --> 02:13.600]  I was commenting on somebody else's post in a Facebook group, which Scotty and I are both
[02:13.600 --> 02:17.280]  members of, and somebody in that group had a lung infection.
[02:17.280 --> 02:21.760]  I commented, Scotty read it, saw my name, I think he attached it to me, and he said
[02:21.760 --> 02:24.360]  on the show that I had a lung infection.
[02:24.360 --> 02:25.360]  That wasn't me.
[02:25.360 --> 02:30.680]  So anybody who sent me the well wishes and the words of encouragement for my lung infection,
[02:30.680 --> 02:32.640]  thank you, but that was not me.
[02:32.640 --> 02:36.760]  I went ahead and I mentally forwarded that off to the person who needed the love and
[02:36.760 --> 02:40.880]  care because they do deserve some support while they are sick, but it wasn't me.
[02:40.880 --> 02:45.920]  So thank you to the community who sent me messages, and shout out to Scotty.
[02:45.920 --> 02:47.720]  That wasn't me, bro.
[02:47.720 --> 02:49.760]  Anyway, let's move forward with the show.
[02:49.760 --> 02:52.000]  I did say that I wanted to talk about some plant stuff.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  I do have one more important topic to talk about.
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.400]  It is winter time here in Colorado.
[02:57.400 --> 03:01.640]  It is cold as, well, you know what I'm going to say, it's cold as fuck out here in Colorado.
[03:01.640 --> 03:04.000]  I was going to not even say it, but I'm just going to say it.
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  It's cold as fuck, dude.
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.600]  It is so cold today.
[03:06.600 --> 03:10.960]  I was walking across the kitchen and my feet were freezing on the tile, had to get some
[03:10.960 --> 03:13.640]  socks and it made me think of something.
[03:13.640 --> 03:17.120]  I need to tell you guys to get your plants off of the floor.
[03:17.120 --> 03:21.120]  In the winter time, it is never a good idea to have your plants on the cold ground, on
[03:21.120 --> 03:22.400]  the cold floor.
[03:22.400 --> 03:23.440]  That ground is super cold.
[03:23.440 --> 03:25.760]  My toes, my feet were cold and purple.
[03:25.760 --> 03:26.760]  I didn't like it.
[03:26.760 --> 03:31.000]  I'm sure if you've got plants on the floor during the winter time, they are not happy
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  with you.
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.240]  They're not going to drink as much as they should.
[03:33.240 --> 03:35.240]  They're not going to eat as much as they should.
[03:35.240 --> 03:36.800]  They won't cycle the way that they should.
[03:36.800 --> 03:39.200]  Their metabolism won't function the way that they should.
[03:39.200 --> 03:40.440]  You will see funky coloring.
[03:40.440 --> 03:42.160]  You will see nutrient issues.
[03:42.160 --> 03:44.320]  It will look like you've got a pH problem.
[03:44.320 --> 03:47.800]  You'll start getting purple stems, purple and goldish colored leaves.
[03:47.800 --> 03:51.640]  That is because your plants are simply too damn cold.
[03:51.640 --> 03:53.320]  It may feel like the room is great.
[03:53.320 --> 03:55.760]  The relative humidity, the temperature may be just fine.
[03:55.760 --> 04:00.200]  Your VPD may be dialed in, but feel the temperature of that floor.
[04:00.200 --> 04:01.520]  Put your bare hand on the floor.
[04:01.520 --> 04:03.020]  Put your bare foot on the floor.
[04:03.020 --> 04:04.840]  If you say, shit, that's cold.
[04:04.840 --> 04:08.160]  Your plants have been sitting there all day and haven't had a chance to move.
[04:08.160 --> 04:10.720]  It was only colder during the dark cycle.
[04:10.720 --> 04:15.180]  If it's cold during your daytime cycle, it is absolutely colder during the night cycle.
[04:15.180 --> 04:16.880]  That light's not getting down there.
[04:16.880 --> 04:20.160]  It's not penetrating the canopy enough to warm up the ground.
[04:20.160 --> 04:24.920]  It is always a good idea to get your plants up off of that cold floor.
[04:24.920 --> 04:26.080]  There are several ways to do it.
[04:26.080 --> 04:28.360]  A very common way is to just buy extra pots.
[04:28.360 --> 04:31.280]  If you're using a three gallon pot, get another three gallon pot.
[04:31.280 --> 04:32.440]  Flip it upside down.
[04:32.440 --> 04:34.100]  Set your plant right on top of there.
[04:34.100 --> 04:38.160]  You did just eat up about 10 to 12 inches of your floor space of your ceiling height,
[04:38.160 --> 04:39.840]  but the plants are now off of the floor.
[04:39.960 --> 04:41.240]  They're not going to freeze.
[04:41.240 --> 04:45.600]  Another common way to correct this, to remedy this, is to just get a tray.
[04:45.600 --> 04:50.160]  A lot of people will buy the four by four botanic care tray or the three by six tray.
[04:50.160 --> 04:51.600]  Build a little cinder block table.
[04:51.600 --> 04:52.920]  Lift that up off the ground.
[04:52.920 --> 04:56.200]  Put a five gallon bucket underneath it so you could drain all your water into there.
[04:56.200 --> 04:57.200]  Pull the bucket out.
[04:57.200 --> 04:58.200]  Dump that somehow.
[04:58.200 --> 05:00.520]  That is a great way to get the plants up off the floor.
[05:00.520 --> 05:05.080]  In a commercial environment, I definitely recommend long sliding greenhouse tables.
[05:05.080 --> 05:06.520]  Those are the way to go.
[05:06.520 --> 05:07.940]  Do what fits your budget.
[05:08.040 --> 05:09.860]  Some people simply use a pallet.
[05:09.860 --> 05:13.140]  Some people will take a cinder block and put the plants on a cinder block.
[05:13.140 --> 05:16.800]  Whatever works for you will be great that fits your budget.
[05:16.800 --> 05:18.260]  Maybe it's not aesthetically pleasing.
[05:18.260 --> 05:21.620]  Maybe you've got to go a little more pricey just to keep the garden up for appearances
[05:21.620 --> 05:23.460]  if that's what you're into.
[05:23.460 --> 05:26.700]  My point is, get those plants up off the ground.
[05:26.700 --> 05:28.000]  You're pouring water into them.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.420]  They're sitting on the cold concrete.
[05:29.420 --> 05:31.100]  That water gets super cold.
[05:31.100 --> 05:32.560]  Your plants are getting pissed off.
[05:32.560 --> 05:35.860]  If you wouldn't want to put your hand, your feet, or maybe even your balls in that water
[05:36.020 --> 05:38.700]  or on that floor, don't do it to your plants.
[05:38.700 --> 05:40.660]  The plants can't go put on some socks.
[05:40.660 --> 05:42.440]  The plants can't grab a pair of shoes.
[05:42.440 --> 05:44.140]  The plants can't crank up the heat.
[05:44.140 --> 05:45.140]  They're fucked.
[05:45.140 --> 05:46.380]  They've got to deal with what you give them.
[05:46.380 --> 05:47.840]  They're your responsibility.
[05:47.840 --> 05:49.860]  Keep your baby's feet warm.
[05:49.860 --> 05:51.540]  Where do we go from there?
[05:51.540 --> 05:53.940]  Let's talk about a failed breeding project.
[05:53.940 --> 05:55.900]  I've got a great email here in front of me.
[05:55.900 --> 06:00.640]  This one came from our friend Marco Esquandolos Ryryraco.
[06:00.640 --> 06:05.140]  The message says, hey, Rasta Jeff, I never miss a podcast and I really appreciate it.
[06:05.420 --> 06:08.940]  Hey, I really appreciate you listening to every podcast episode.
[06:08.940 --> 06:10.300]  That does mean a lot to me.
[06:10.300 --> 06:14.320]  It says, I hope you do more strain specific episodes.
[06:14.320 --> 06:16.980]  If you've been listening to the show for a while, you know that I do like to highlight
[06:16.980 --> 06:18.580]  some of the strains that I have bred.
[06:18.580 --> 06:23.460]  I've kind of taken a break from that because I've got so many Patreon messages and so much
[06:23.460 --> 06:28.740]  listener generated content that it is more responsible of me to answer your questions
[06:28.740 --> 06:31.380]  than to simply advertise my brand and my products.
[06:31.380 --> 06:35.220]  I feel it was more important for me to help you than advertise my stuff.
[06:35.220 --> 06:38.980]  If you've got a question about a specific strain, I will do a strain report on it, but
[06:38.980 --> 06:40.180]  I've held off on those for a minute.
[06:40.180 --> 06:41.340]  I've got a couple written.
[06:41.340 --> 06:42.540]  I just need to throw them out.
[06:42.540 --> 06:44.300]  Let me stay focused.
[06:44.300 --> 06:48.560]  This one says, it would also be really cool to hear about one of your breeding experiments
[06:48.560 --> 06:50.980]  that did not work very well.
[06:50.980 --> 06:55.140]  For instance, I reversed a Leonardo and I crossed a bunch of your strains, but the resulting
[06:55.140 --> 06:57.880]  crosses were no better than the parents.
[06:57.880 --> 06:59.460]  So that's not successful.
[06:59.460 --> 07:01.020]  That is a very good point.
[07:01.020 --> 07:02.680]  When you are breeding, you do need to have a goal.
[07:02.680 --> 07:04.200]  You need to have some standards.
[07:04.200 --> 07:06.740]  The idea is to improve upon cannabis.
[07:06.740 --> 07:09.580]  When we were breeding, we don't want to just make seeds just to make seeds.
[07:09.580 --> 07:11.420]  We don't want to make more reproduction shit.
[07:11.420 --> 07:12.580]  We want to make winners.
[07:12.580 --> 07:15.700]  If you got two sixes, you better make a seven or an eight out of that.
[07:15.700 --> 07:18.380]  If you got two sixes, I hope you can make a 12.
[07:18.380 --> 07:20.100]  Just not how things work all the time.
[07:20.100 --> 07:21.260]  Let me stay focused.
[07:21.260 --> 07:26.500]  It goes on to say the orange chasm to Leo was strong, stable, and frosty.
[07:26.500 --> 07:29.180]  So a great gift for first time growers.
[07:29.180 --> 07:33.660]  But once the growers get serious, we will get them more Irie originals.
[07:33.660 --> 07:35.260]  Be well and best wishes.
[07:35.260 --> 07:37.540]  Feel free to use my, and then he says my name.
[07:37.540 --> 07:40.780]  I'm just going to call you Marco Esquandolos because I like that.
[07:40.780 --> 07:43.740]  Shout out to my buddy Marco Esquandolos.
[07:43.740 --> 07:45.700]  Run like an antelope, my friend.
[07:45.700 --> 07:49.380]  Let's talk about some failed breeding projects.
[07:49.380 --> 07:53.580]  I've been breeding for a long time and I've put out, there are probably 50 strains on
[07:53.580 --> 07:54.660]  my website right now.
[07:54.660 --> 07:58.260]  There's probably closer to 75 or a hundred strains that you can read about that I've
[07:58.260 --> 08:00.060]  created that I've released.
[08:00.060 --> 08:01.220]  They're on my website.
[08:01.220 --> 08:03.100]  I've done a lot of work.
[08:03.100 --> 08:09.300]  That being said, if there are 75 on the website, there are probably another 25 to 50 that I
[08:09.300 --> 08:11.380]  never even released.
[08:11.380 --> 08:17.860]  There are probably 10 or 15 that I threw large batches of seeds away because, oh, excuse
[08:17.860 --> 08:18.860]  me.
[08:18.860 --> 08:20.020]  I'm going to, do I edit that or not?
[08:20.020 --> 08:21.020]  Probably not.
[08:21.020 --> 08:22.020]  Let's take a drink and keep moving.
[08:22.020 --> 08:26.300]  There are large batches of seeds that I threw away because I did not feel like those plants,
[08:26.300 --> 08:30.660]  those seeds, that breeding project lived up to my expectations and it did not improve
[08:30.660 --> 08:31.660]  upon cannabis.
[08:31.660 --> 08:33.440]  It didn't move cannabis forward.
[08:33.440 --> 08:36.540]  If that was a genetic dice roll, I went backwards three steps.
[08:36.540 --> 08:38.340]  I wasn't happy with the outcome.
[08:38.340 --> 08:42.380]  I took plant A and plant B and like I said before, maybe they were both sevens or eights.
[08:42.380 --> 08:44.300]  I wanted to make nines and tens.
[08:44.300 --> 08:47.180]  I came out with more sixes and sevens and that's not acceptable.
[08:47.180 --> 08:49.140]  So I have thrown shit away.
[08:49.140 --> 08:51.060]  Let's talk about some of those projects.
[08:51.100 --> 08:55.180]  I have talked about the Lemon OG project that I worked with.
[08:55.180 --> 08:56.380]  Let me take a sip of this water.
[08:56.380 --> 09:00.860]  All right, we'll keep going now.
[09:00.860 --> 09:05.300]  I got a clone of a Lemon OG plant and I loved that plant.
[09:05.300 --> 09:06.580]  It tasted amazing.
[09:06.580 --> 09:08.980]  It had a really nice balanced buzz to it.
[09:08.980 --> 09:09.980]  It grew very well.
[09:09.980 --> 09:11.780]  I never had a problem with it in the garden.
[09:11.780 --> 09:12.780]  I never got mites.
[09:12.780 --> 09:13.900]  It never got mildew.
[09:13.900 --> 09:15.580]  It would clone very easily.
[09:15.580 --> 09:17.460]  You could top it and it would make a bunch of branches.
[09:17.460 --> 09:20.460]  You could leave it un-topped and grow a big old giant glory bud.
[09:20.460 --> 09:22.340]  That was a great fucking plant.
[09:22.380 --> 09:24.900]  I thought it would be amazing to breed to it.
[09:24.900 --> 09:25.900]  So I had a male.
[09:25.900 --> 09:28.060]  I don't remember which male I used at that time.
[09:28.060 --> 09:29.060]  I reversed it.
[09:29.060 --> 09:30.940]  I reversed the Lemon Kush.
[09:30.940 --> 09:35.020]  The Lemon OG Kush got reversed is what I did and I pollinated a bunch of shit with that
[09:35.020 --> 09:39.620]  Lemon Kush and everything that came from there was complete garbage.
[09:39.620 --> 09:41.580]  It was not good at all.
[09:41.580 --> 09:43.820]  Some of the plants would grow with great vigor.
[09:43.820 --> 09:48.260]  They would put on a bunch of weight, big fat buds, but then when you smoke it, there was
[09:48.260 --> 09:54.020]  zero, absolute zero buzz came from any of the offspring from that Lemon OG breeding
[09:54.020 --> 09:55.020]  project.
[09:55.020 --> 09:57.580]  I think I pollinated two or three different plants.
[09:57.580 --> 09:58.660]  We grew them out.
[09:58.660 --> 10:02.460]  We smoked them and everybody went, that tastes good and it smells good, but I'm not high
[10:02.460 --> 10:03.660]  at all.
[10:03.660 --> 10:06.740]  So in my opinion, that was a failed breeding project.
[10:06.740 --> 10:08.500]  Of course, we didn't take it to a lab.
[10:08.500 --> 10:09.820]  There could have been CBD in there.
[10:09.820 --> 10:13.260]  There could have been CBTHCV, CBG.
[10:13.260 --> 10:15.180]  There could have been a lot of other cannabinoids.
[10:15.180 --> 10:17.940]  It wasn't giving us the head buzz that we were looking for.
[10:18.620 --> 10:20.420]  It wasn't giving us the familiar stone feeling you get when you smoke weed.
[10:20.420 --> 10:22.060]  We weren't getting any of that.
[10:22.060 --> 10:25.060]  It was kind of like making you wish you would have gotten stoned because it was like smoking
[10:25.060 --> 10:26.060]  weed light.
[10:26.060 --> 10:29.100]  You'd smoke it and just go, well, my lungs burned and I coughed and there's a roach and
[10:29.100 --> 10:31.820]  there's smoke in the air, but I don't feel shit from that.
[10:31.820 --> 10:34.800]  So that was a failed breeding project in my opinion.
[10:34.800 --> 10:36.300]  We aren't machines.
[10:36.300 --> 10:39.860]  Nobody was looking for CBD, CBG, THCV.
[10:39.860 --> 10:41.140]  We wanted to get high.
[10:41.140 --> 10:44.500]  So in my opinion, that was a failed breeding experiment.
[10:44.500 --> 10:47.980]  It didn't make cannabis go forward.
[10:47.980 --> 10:51.900]  I think, and a lot of people are going to have a varying opinion, I think Night Nurse
[10:51.900 --> 10:52.900]  kind of sucked.
[10:52.900 --> 10:54.480]  I released Night Nurse.
[10:54.480 --> 10:55.480]  We ran it.
[10:55.480 --> 10:56.480]  We tested it.
[10:56.480 --> 10:58.580]  It did a great job in testing.
[10:58.580 --> 11:02.780]  Then I saw later on down the line that it wasn't, I was seeing other phenotypes and
[11:02.780 --> 11:05.980]  other plant structures that I didn't see in testing.
[11:05.980 --> 11:07.380]  I guess we didn't test enough.
[11:07.380 --> 11:10.500]  Maybe new environments gave us new things.
[11:10.500 --> 11:13.460]  But that's when I really started testing a little bit harder was when I saw that Night
[11:13.460 --> 11:15.820]  Nurse wasn't what I thought it was.
[11:15.820 --> 11:17.020]  She was cool for me.
[11:17.020 --> 11:18.740]  She was cool in a couple of local grows.
[11:18.740 --> 11:20.060]  She kicked ass in a commercial grow.
[11:20.060 --> 11:24.540]  When I saw her go to other smaller grows, it was when she went under LEDs and ceramic
[11:24.540 --> 11:27.800]  metal halides, the Night Nurse just, it wasn't a good plant.
[11:27.800 --> 11:29.820]  In my opinion, I should not have put that one out.
[11:29.820 --> 11:30.820]  I have discontinued.
[11:30.820 --> 11:32.220]  I'll never make more of that.
[11:32.220 --> 11:36.300]  I think I gave the last bit of seeds away just to have them gone and people know what
[11:36.300 --> 11:37.300]  they've got.
[11:37.300 --> 11:39.020]  Like I told them, that plant's kind of problematic.
[11:39.020 --> 11:40.020]  It's not the best.
[11:40.020 --> 11:41.020]  And they said, I want that.
[11:41.020 --> 11:42.280]  It's got my attention.
[11:42.280 --> 11:43.320]  So they've got it.
[11:43.340 --> 11:46.120]  In my opinion, that was not one of the best.
[11:46.120 --> 11:52.540]  I made King Chem Grape Stomper F2s and they were fucking wild.
[11:52.540 --> 11:54.920]  There was no uniformity in there.
[11:54.920 --> 11:59.060]  If you grew 10 seeds, you got 10 different plants out of that batch of seeds.
[11:59.060 --> 12:01.360]  So that was a failed experiment in my opinion.
[12:01.360 --> 12:06.800]  I wanted to lock in certain traits of the King Chem Grape Stomper OG and I did not.
[12:06.800 --> 12:09.040]  I unleashed the beast.
[12:09.040 --> 12:14.420]  I fucking unlocked something to where every single phenotype was wildly, vastly different.
[12:14.420 --> 12:15.900]  There were tall, skinny plants in there.
[12:15.900 --> 12:17.280]  There were tall, fat plants in there.
[12:17.280 --> 12:18.400]  There were short, skinny plants.
[12:18.400 --> 12:20.300]  There were short, fat plants.
[12:20.300 --> 12:23.440]  There were sativa, crazy sativa looking plants in that mix.
[12:23.440 --> 12:25.640]  There were heavy, heavy indica plants in that mix.
[12:25.640 --> 12:26.840]  I don't know what I did.
[12:26.840 --> 12:28.820]  It wasn't what I wanted.
[12:28.820 --> 12:30.080]  Sometimes you expect that in an F2.
[12:30.080 --> 12:33.220]  You will expect variety, wild variation.
[12:33.220 --> 12:38.320]  You'll also see in an F2, you will see where they strongly outperformed the parents.
[12:38.320 --> 12:41.880]  You get a lot of improved traits from those, but they don't have the vigor.
[12:41.880 --> 12:42.880]  They may have the potency.
[12:42.880 --> 12:45.900]  You may see different phenotypes, but they start losing that vigor.
[12:45.900 --> 12:49.000]  So F2 showed a lot of wild traits that I was not prepared for.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.440]  I abandoned that project.
[12:50.440 --> 12:52.120]  I did not move forward with it.
[12:52.120 --> 12:54.000]  I thought that was a fucking mess.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.840]  I gave that up.
[12:56.840 --> 12:58.400]  Where else are we going to talk about?
[12:58.400 --> 12:59.400]  Testing.
[12:59.400 --> 13:00.880]  Oh, Platinum OG.
[13:00.880 --> 13:04.600]  I bred the Grapeful Dog to Platinum OG.
[13:04.600 --> 13:06.000]  The seeds were big and fat.
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.200]  They were stout.
[13:07.200 --> 13:08.200]  Everything looked healthy.
[13:09.080 --> 13:10.080]  Everything was fine.
[13:10.080 --> 13:11.080]  None of the seeds would germinate.
[13:11.080 --> 13:13.240]  So that was a failure in my opinion.
[13:13.240 --> 13:17.360]  Other seeds that came from that same round of breeding all germinated just fine.
[13:17.360 --> 13:19.120]  They all grew with great vigor.
[13:19.120 --> 13:20.300]  They harvested well.
[13:20.300 --> 13:21.300]  They went to market.
[13:21.300 --> 13:23.640]  They went on the website and got advertised and sold.
[13:23.640 --> 13:28.280]  But the Platinum OG to Grapeful Dog was terrible.
[13:28.280 --> 13:29.280]  They'd never germinated.
[13:29.280 --> 13:32.840]  I did not get one sprout out of the entire batch of seeds.
[13:32.840 --> 13:35.480]  So in my opinion, that was a major failure.
[13:35.480 --> 13:40.360]  That whole plant worth of seeds, fucking nothing happened.
[13:40.360 --> 13:46.880]  Breeding to the Mac sometimes can be not 100% failure, but not a great success.
[13:46.880 --> 13:50.600]  When I pollinate the Mac, I've pollinated the Mac with a couple of different things.
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.400]  I get very, very minimal, minimal seeds from the Mac pollination.
[13:55.400 --> 13:59.240]  If I hit it with an Arise male, if I hit it with King Solomon at just the right time,
[13:59.240 --> 14:00.880]  I can get some seeds out of her.
[14:00.880 --> 14:03.320]  I've gotten 25 seeds in one harvest.
[14:03.320 --> 14:04.680]  That's the best I've done.
[14:04.680 --> 14:07.520]  The first time I tried, I got six.
[14:07.520 --> 14:11.440]  Not 60, not 600, not 6,000, but six.
[14:11.440 --> 14:14.200]  The plant next to it gave me about 2,000 seeds.
[14:14.200 --> 14:16.680]  The Mac plant, I got six.
[14:16.680 --> 14:22.740]  So in my opinion, breeding with the Mac sometimes is not the best success kind of a failure,
[14:22.740 --> 14:25.840]  but the offspring that come from those good seeds are amazing.
[14:25.840 --> 14:29.400]  So I don't know that that is a complete failure.
[14:29.400 --> 14:35.800]  A long time ago, I reversed Golden Goat and pollinated a headband cut with the reversed
[14:35.800 --> 14:37.280]  Golden Goat pollen.
[14:37.280 --> 14:39.080]  I don't know what happened.
[14:39.080 --> 14:43.740]  That headband plant that received the pollen shriveled and died within two days.
[14:43.740 --> 14:46.900]  Other plants in the room were successful.
[14:46.900 --> 14:48.200]  Those seeds made it to fruition.
[14:48.200 --> 14:49.200]  I've grown the seeds.
[14:49.200 --> 14:50.280]  I've sold the seeds.
[14:50.280 --> 14:54.840]  For some reason, that headband plant was like, fuck you, I'm not taking your pollen.
[14:54.840 --> 14:56.320]  It just shriveled up and it died.
[14:56.320 --> 14:57.320]  I've never seen it.
[14:57.320 --> 14:58.920]  I've never had that happen before.
[14:58.940 --> 14:59.940]  And I didn't try it again.
[14:59.940 --> 15:03.520]  I figured that that was a one-time thing, and if it did that to me, I wasn't going to
[15:03.520 --> 15:08.040]  waste my opportunity or my time or my plants or my money or my space trying that project
[15:08.040 --> 15:09.040]  again.
[15:09.040 --> 15:10.040]  I let that one go.
[15:10.040 --> 15:11.040]  I do have more notes.
[15:11.040 --> 15:13.000]  Let me keep myself on track here.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.520]  Some reversals completely suck.
[15:15.520 --> 15:18.200]  Sometimes trying to reverse plants is a pain in the ass.
[15:18.200 --> 15:20.400]  Some plants don't reverse well.
[15:20.400 --> 15:21.560]  I've talked about reversing.
[15:21.560 --> 15:25.600]  That is when I treat a female plant with a product that I make myself.
[15:25.600 --> 15:27.320]  I make my own silver thiosulfate.
[15:27.320 --> 15:32.720]  I apply that to a plant in very specific intervals, durations, and dilutions.
[15:32.720 --> 15:34.880]  I think those are the words I'm looking for.
[15:34.880 --> 15:41.480]  And most of the time, I can create a female plant that will produce pollen sacks.
[15:41.480 --> 15:45.360]  And those pollen sacks are feminized, and I can use that to make female seeds.
[15:45.360 --> 15:50.440]  However, sometimes those reversals don't make much pollen, if any pollen at all.
[15:50.440 --> 15:52.720]  You've got to learn the female plant.
[15:52.720 --> 15:55.880]  When you start spraying a female plant, it'll react in different ways.
[15:55.880 --> 15:59.400]  So I will get multiple clones of the same plant and treat them with different sprays
[15:59.400 --> 16:01.640]  and find out what works the best.
[16:01.640 --> 16:04.800]  But sometimes I can't get those plants to reverse properly.
[16:04.800 --> 16:06.920]  Some plants just don't want to reverse.
[16:06.920 --> 16:07.920]  Sometimes they're stubborn.
[16:07.920 --> 16:08.920]  They don't give you a lot of...
[16:08.920 --> 16:09.920]  They're real stingy.
[16:09.920 --> 16:10.960]  They don't give you a lot of pollen.
[16:10.960 --> 16:15.000]  So sometimes the reversals are a pain in the ass.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.520]  Testing is really where I try to find all of those issues.
[16:18.520 --> 16:19.520]  I try to...
[16:19.520 --> 16:21.320]  I grow them myself most of the time.
[16:21.320 --> 16:22.560]  I'm being honest with you right now.
[16:22.560 --> 16:26.680]  The Jack the Ripper's, the Jack the Ripper blueberry cookies, I'm letting Tenacity get
[16:26.680 --> 16:28.480]  the very first testers out of those.
[16:28.480 --> 16:29.480]  I don't have room.
[16:29.480 --> 16:30.480]  I don't have time.
[16:30.480 --> 16:31.480]  I don't have space.
[16:31.480 --> 16:32.480]  I want to get them out.
[16:32.480 --> 16:33.480]  You guys are testing those for me.
[16:33.480 --> 16:35.120]  I've got great faith in those.
[16:35.120 --> 16:38.500]  They went to close friends and family before they went out.
[16:38.500 --> 16:40.120]  So they got one round of testing.
[16:40.120 --> 16:41.520]  They've passed that round of testing.
[16:41.520 --> 16:44.000]  They're going out to the public testers now.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.200]  Once I know that the public is good with those, then I will put them out.
[16:47.200 --> 16:54.280]  But the testing is what really reveals the success or failure rate in a breeding project.
[16:54.280 --> 16:56.280]  So if I can grow it, that's cool.
[16:56.280 --> 16:58.480]  Like I said, the night nurse, I knew the male plant.
[16:58.480 --> 16:59.640]  I knew the female plant.
[16:59.640 --> 17:01.720]  I knew what to expect from that plant.
[17:01.720 --> 17:03.640]  The close group, they could grow it really well.
[17:03.640 --> 17:07.240]  When it got out to other lighting and other environments, that wasn't as stellar as I
[17:07.240 --> 17:08.240]  expected.
[17:08.240 --> 17:11.640]  So the testing would have revealed that if we had done more testing on it, which has
[17:11.640 --> 17:14.000]  in turn caused me to step up my testing.
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.760]  I test much more thoroughly now.
[17:15.840 --> 17:18.760]  I've evolved a lot as a grower, as a breeder, as a business person.
[17:18.760 --> 17:23.560]  So that is my brief rant on failed breeding projects.
[17:23.560 --> 17:27.960]  I have had a lot of success, but for every successful breeding project, there was some
[17:27.960 --> 17:32.320]  sort of failure behind it that inspired me to do better, taught me how to do things more
[17:32.320 --> 17:34.120]  correctly, just moved me forward.
[17:34.120 --> 17:35.120]  So learn from your mistakes.
[17:35.120 --> 17:38.000]  There are always going to be failures in breeding.
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.680]  Breeding is kind of like a, it's a crapshoot.
[17:39.680 --> 17:40.840]  It's a dice roll.
[17:40.840 --> 17:44.080]  You're putting a bunch of pieces together and hoping that they land together.
[17:44.080 --> 17:45.080]  You've got the ingredients here.
[17:45.400 --> 17:49.120]  You've got the ingredients here, but you don't get to pick exactly how much of each ingredient
[17:49.120 --> 17:50.120]  goes into the mix.
[17:50.120 --> 17:51.120]  So you've got to hope for the best.
[17:51.120 --> 17:55.880]  And sometimes we create a big bag of bullshit and then it's our responsibility as a breeder
[17:55.880 --> 18:00.760]  to throw that bullshit away, flush it down the toilet, feed it to the birds, maybe sprout
[18:00.760 --> 18:03.460]  the sprouts and eat the sprouts if you're into that sort of thing.
[18:03.460 --> 18:07.040]  But they are not meant to be put in anybody's cannabis garden.
[18:07.040 --> 18:08.040]  Get rid of those.
[18:08.040 --> 18:10.760]  Set yourself and your fellow growers up for success.
[18:10.760 --> 18:13.080]  All right, Marco Esquandolos.
[18:13.080 --> 18:14.440]  I feel like I answered that question.
[18:14.800 --> 18:15.800]  That was a fun one.
[18:15.800 --> 18:16.920]  Thank you for getting me ranting on that.
[18:16.920 --> 18:18.920]  I do enjoy breeding and talking about breeding.
[18:18.920 --> 18:20.200]  So that was a lot of fun.
[18:20.200 --> 18:21.960]  I've got one more message here.
[18:21.960 --> 18:23.040]  Let's not waste a lot of time.
[18:23.040 --> 18:24.320]  Let's jump right into this one.
[18:24.320 --> 18:29.640]  This one comes from Jason Jay in Northern California and it goes like this.
[18:29.640 --> 18:34.680]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, I've been growing for years and have great success now with cocoa.
[18:34.680 --> 18:39.080]  I auto water five times a day in arrow pots from a 30 gallon res.
[18:39.080 --> 18:42.760]  I do not flush weekly and this new system cranks.
[18:42.760 --> 18:47.400]  So that is a reference to another episode when we were talking about weekly flushing.
[18:47.400 --> 18:53.240]  This listener does not flush on a weekly basis in cocoa and let's see, did they say it cranks?
[18:53.240 --> 18:55.280]  Yes, their system cranks.
[18:55.280 --> 18:58.520]  It says, like you said, if you flush, they miss a feed.
[18:58.520 --> 19:01.520]  And when you're in cocoa, they want every feeding that you give them.
[19:01.520 --> 19:03.760]  So you don't want to flush and miss a feed.
[19:03.760 --> 19:08.200]  It says, if you do flush, just flush the pot by hand.
[19:08.200 --> 19:10.800]  Don't drain the res and do all that mess.
[19:10.840 --> 19:14.240]  I can flush a plant and not even interrupt its feeding schedule.
[19:14.240 --> 19:19.560]  I'm confused why people have trouble with flushing or even do it at all mid grow.
[19:19.560 --> 19:21.640]  I don't know why people flush mid grow.
[19:21.640 --> 19:26.200]  I see people on social media say, I'm about to switch from veg to flour.
[19:26.200 --> 19:27.680]  How hard should I flush?
[19:27.680 --> 19:31.400]  Or it's the end of my normal feeding week, I'm going to flush.
[19:31.400 --> 19:32.720]  That's unnecessary.
[19:32.720 --> 19:36.120]  You are stopping the plants from eating one solid meal.
[19:36.120 --> 19:38.120]  You only get so many feedings for these plants.
[19:38.120 --> 19:41.120]  If you go, if there are nine weeks, that's 63 days.
[19:41.120 --> 19:43.840]  If you feed them every day, that is 63 feedings.
[19:43.840 --> 19:47.760]  If you flush them once a week, that is nine feedings they did not get.
[19:47.760 --> 19:48.760]  That's a percentage.
[19:48.760 --> 19:50.160]  I don't do the math there for me.
[19:50.160 --> 19:51.560]  I'm not focused on that.
[19:51.560 --> 19:53.640]  That's a percentage of feedings that you did not get.
[19:53.640 --> 19:55.920]  That is performance lost from your plants.
[19:55.920 --> 19:58.000]  So don't flush unnecessarily.
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.340]  Don't flush excessively.
[19:59.340 --> 20:02.040]  If you didn't fuck anything up, there's nothing to flush out.
[20:02.040 --> 20:06.680]  Now it says, my question is, I'm learning more about PK spiking and calcium ramping
[20:06.680 --> 20:07.800]  in flour.
[20:07.840 --> 20:11.480]  I'm confident enough to know to try these techniques, but I could use a little guidance
[20:11.480 --> 20:14.320]  on when to spike PK and so on.
[20:14.320 --> 20:17.480]  When should I start spiking my PK if I choose to do so?
[20:17.480 --> 20:20.800]  And you guys, PK is phosphorus and potassium.
[20:20.800 --> 20:23.080]  I will say NPK a lot in the future.
[20:23.080 --> 20:25.280]  I mean, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
[20:25.280 --> 20:27.760]  So PK is phosphorus and potassium.
[20:27.760 --> 20:29.080]  Or is it potassium and phosphorus?
[20:29.080 --> 20:30.280]  I think I was right the first time.
[20:30.280 --> 20:31.840]  Never second guess yourself.
[20:31.840 --> 20:36.840]  It says, I've heard this talked about much on any, I have not heard this talked about
[20:36.960 --> 20:38.200]  on any podcast.
[20:38.200 --> 20:39.400]  So I hope you can help me.
[20:39.400 --> 20:43.280]  I also want to try some soluble homemade calcium inputs.
[20:43.280 --> 20:46.960]  Char some eggshells to their carbon form, dissolve in vinegar, and eventually you have
[20:46.960 --> 20:48.840]  calcium phosphate.
[20:48.840 --> 20:50.000]  Basically there's a little more to it.
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.000]  Now I'm rambling.
[20:51.000 --> 20:52.080]  Yes, you are my friend.
[20:52.080 --> 20:56.960]  But it says, I love what you do, brother, and keep it up from Jason Jay in Northern
[20:56.960 --> 20:57.960]  Colorado.
[20:57.960 --> 20:59.040]  Did I say California the first time?
[20:59.040 --> 21:01.960]  I think I misread that and said California.
[21:01.960 --> 21:03.680]  Our buddy Jay is in Northern Colorado.
[21:03.680 --> 21:04.840]  Shout out to my buddies up North.
[21:04.840 --> 21:07.720]  I hope you are warm because it's freaking cold and snowy today.
[21:07.720 --> 21:09.640]  You're probably getting beat up up there.
[21:09.640 --> 21:14.800]  So the question here is about ramping up and increasing phosphorus and potassium later
[21:14.800 --> 21:16.560]  in flour.
[21:16.560 --> 21:18.660]  And why would somebody want to do that?
[21:18.660 --> 21:21.880]  As the flowering cycle goes on, our plants don't want as much nitrogen.
[21:21.880 --> 21:24.800]  Too much nitrogen and flour will make your plants grow stretchy.
[21:24.800 --> 21:27.220]  They won't get the bud set you're hoping for.
[21:27.220 --> 21:29.200]  So we want to taper off the nitrogen.
[21:29.200 --> 21:32.400]  In turn, we want to increase phosphorus and potassium.
[21:32.400 --> 21:34.000]  That is what builds fat buds.
[21:34.160 --> 21:36.360]  That's what gives us big, strong plants.
[21:36.360 --> 21:41.000]  So our listener, our friend Jason, is asking, when do I do this increase?
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  When do I start this?
[21:43.000 --> 21:44.780]  Don't do anything too extreme.
[21:44.780 --> 21:46.340]  Always kind of ramp up slowly.
[21:46.340 --> 21:52.160]  Don't go from like so many PPMs or EC of phosphorus and potassium.
[21:52.160 --> 21:53.200]  Don't double it the next day.
[21:53.200 --> 21:54.560]  Just taper your way up.
[21:54.560 --> 21:55.860]  Slowly elevate.
[21:55.860 --> 21:59.720]  Work your way up until you see that the plants are showing you that they've had enough.
[21:59.720 --> 22:03.420]  The way to see that they're getting enough nutrients is to look for what I call the nails
[22:03.420 --> 22:04.460]  getting done.
[22:04.460 --> 22:07.140]  The tips of the leaves will look just like they went to the manicurist and got their
[22:07.140 --> 22:08.140]  fingernails painted.
[22:08.140 --> 22:12.940]  You see a little leaf burn, little leaf burn, little tips, little burns on the leaf tips.
[22:12.940 --> 22:16.020]  Damn, that was a lot of words my brain wouldn't put into a sentence.
[22:16.020 --> 22:20.580]  Little burns on the leaf tips that look like the fingernails got done are the first signs
[22:20.580 --> 22:24.100]  that you are pushing that plant a little bit too hard with nutrients.
[22:24.100 --> 22:27.700]  When you see that, you can either stick with the amount of nutrients you are giving the
[22:27.700 --> 22:31.540]  plant because you're not roasting it, you're not toasting it, you're pushing it right to
[22:31.620 --> 22:35.380]  the stressful point, or you can dial back just a little bit.
[22:35.380 --> 22:38.380]  I myself, I like to see just a touch of new burn.
[22:38.380 --> 22:43.220]  I want to push them right to the limit until I see that little itty bitty sign of, hey,
[22:43.220 --> 22:44.220]  that's a little bit too much.
[22:44.220 --> 22:47.620]  When they say, hey, that's a little bit too much, I say, well, you're taking it, so let's
[22:47.620 --> 22:48.940]  just keep giving it to you.
[22:48.940 --> 22:51.780]  I give it to them at that strength until the end.
[22:51.780 --> 22:55.820]  Taper up slowly, but let's talk about when to do it.
[22:55.820 --> 23:00.460]  Increase P and K slowly over weeks three through seven.
[23:00.460 --> 23:03.260]  If you're going to harvest at week nine, you want to start flushing at the end of week
[23:03.260 --> 23:06.060]  seven, so slowly ramp it up.
[23:06.060 --> 23:09.460]  Start at week three, slowly ramp up until week seven.
[23:09.460 --> 23:12.380]  Maybe max out at week six and keep going at week six.
[23:12.380 --> 23:15.820]  Maybe max out at week five, but see what those plants want.
[23:15.820 --> 23:17.460]  Have a goal, have a strategy.
[23:17.460 --> 23:20.300]  Don't just think you're going to go in there and increase things and the plants are going
[23:20.300 --> 23:21.300]  to get bigger.
[23:21.300 --> 23:25.420]  When you start increasing your phosphorus and potassium, you may also throw your CalMag
[23:25.540 --> 23:30.740]  out of whack, so you may need to gently increase the calcium and magnesium as well.
[23:30.740 --> 23:32.460]  Is it the phosphorus or the potassium?
[23:32.460 --> 23:33.860]  Let's see.
[23:33.860 --> 23:37.100]  Potassium and CalMag will mess with each other.
[23:37.100 --> 23:41.820]  If you give one too much calcium, it'll mess up your phosphorus uptake or your potassium
[23:41.820 --> 23:42.820]  uptake.
[23:42.820 --> 23:46.620]  If you give too much potassium, it will mess with your CalMag uptake, so pay attention
[23:46.620 --> 23:48.580]  to those ratios.
[23:48.580 --> 23:53.060]  Slowly increase nutrients over weeks three through seven, and then right before you flush,
[23:53.060 --> 23:55.140]  get them with that winter frost one time.
[23:55.140 --> 24:00.300]  That'll give you that last big fat dose of NPK, and that should give you a big fat harvest.
[24:00.300 --> 24:04.740]  Like I keep saying, don't boost them too hard right away because you will burn them.
[24:04.740 --> 24:06.180]  Watch the leaf tips for info.
[24:06.180 --> 24:08.840]  The leaf tips will tell you everything you need to know.
[24:08.840 --> 24:11.500]  If they start getting crispy, then they're getting burned.
[24:11.500 --> 24:15.860]  If you start seeing yellow splotches in the middle, you may be overdoing it with the calcium.
[24:15.860 --> 24:21.180]  If you see little camouflage-looking patterns up here, you may be underdoing the calcium,
[24:21.180 --> 24:22.660]  so pay attention to the leaves.
[24:22.660 --> 24:25.500]  They will give you all of the information that you need.
[24:25.500 --> 24:27.820]  Now here is something very important.
[24:27.820 --> 24:30.580]  Write down everything that you do.
[24:30.580 --> 24:34.820]  Write down either your EC or your PPMs of your feeding solution.
[24:34.820 --> 24:36.220]  You are changing things.
[24:36.220 --> 24:37.880]  This is a time to take notes.
[24:37.880 --> 24:41.540]  If this goes well, you're going to want to remember exactly what you did.
[24:41.540 --> 24:46.020]  If this goes terribly wrong, you're going to want to remember exactly what you did,
[24:46.020 --> 24:47.900]  so take a lot of notes.
[24:47.900 --> 24:55.300]  Write down at week three, day 23, I added this much NPK at this EC or this PPM.
[24:55.300 --> 24:59.260]  Write down how many milliliters of each bottle you used.
[24:59.260 --> 25:02.360]  Like I said, this could go beautifully or this could go terribly.
[25:02.360 --> 25:06.200]  You want documentation, and if it goes perfectly, you're going to want to repeat it, so if you've
[25:06.200 --> 25:10.200]  got the notes written down, you've got repeatable results, you could just follow that recipe,
[25:10.200 --> 25:11.620]  do it all over again.
[25:11.620 --> 25:13.100]  I keep saying this.
[25:13.100 --> 25:17.300]  The most important part is to watch the plants for feedback.
[25:17.300 --> 25:18.500]  Feed them, watch them.
[25:18.500 --> 25:19.500]  You're in cocoa.
[25:19.500 --> 25:21.620]  You're going to get a reaction within 48 hours.
[25:21.620 --> 25:25.740]  You will know if those plants are happy or angry with you very quickly.
[25:25.740 --> 25:28.020]  Also, test your runoff.
[25:28.020 --> 25:32.820]  If those plants are giving you real high runoff numbers or real low runoff numbers, and you
[25:32.820 --> 25:36.980]  can see if they are or are not responding to the feedings, you can adjust from there.
[25:36.980 --> 25:40.740]  If they're giving you real high runoffs, that means you've got too much nutrients in there.
[25:40.740 --> 25:44.180]  If they're giving you real low runoff numbers, you may be able to feed a little bit higher.
[25:44.180 --> 25:46.500]  All right, where are we from there?
[25:46.700 --> 25:51.500]  You talked about the ... Oh, this is going to be very strain and very plant dependent,
[25:51.500 --> 25:53.260]  so you have to watch each plant.
[25:53.260 --> 25:58.300]  I know that golden goat crosses, you can NPK the shit out of them at the end, but if you
[25:58.300 --> 26:01.220]  feed the ... I'm not even going to mention that plant.
[26:01.220 --> 26:04.020]  There was a plant at a commercial grow that if we fed it too much at the end, it would
[26:04.020 --> 26:05.020]  just go crazy.
[26:05.020 --> 26:06.020]  It wouldn't even grow.
[26:06.020 --> 26:07.020]  It would start growing in a circle.
[26:07.020 --> 26:11.340]  Instead of growing one big bud, it would just start putting little popcorn buds in a spiral
[26:11.340 --> 26:12.460]  up the stem.
[26:12.460 --> 26:14.740]  That plant sucked to grow.
[26:14.740 --> 26:15.740]  It's all about the plants.
[26:15.980 --> 26:20.820]  It is all very strain specific, but slowly start increasing your phosphorus and potassium
[26:20.820 --> 26:22.740]  around week three.
[26:22.740 --> 26:28.620]  Slowly build that up until week seven, then hit it with the winter frost, then start flushing
[26:28.620 --> 26:31.300]  from there and you should have excellent results.
[26:31.300 --> 26:32.420]  Pay attention to the plants.
[26:32.420 --> 26:33.420]  Take a lot of notes.
[26:33.420 --> 26:37.660]  Remember, the meters are great, the toys are great, but the plants are always the boss.
[26:37.660 --> 26:41.460]  Now for that organic part of your question, you said, char up some egg shells to their
[26:41.460 --> 26:46.420]  carbon form, dissolve them in vinegar, and basically you have calcium phosphate.
[26:46.420 --> 26:48.020]  That is not my area of expertise.
[26:48.020 --> 26:50.660]  I'm not going to act like I know anything about that.
[26:50.660 --> 26:53.540]  I am a bottled salt grower.
[26:53.540 --> 26:54.540]  This is not my realm.
[26:54.540 --> 26:59.460]  I invite you to join us on Embracing Organics and we can talk about making your calcium
[26:59.460 --> 27:02.620]  supplement from your vinegar and egg shells.
[27:02.620 --> 27:05.020]  That is the appropriate place for that conversation.
[27:05.020 --> 27:09.140]  Not to blow you off, but I'm going to be honest and say that's not my area, not my expertise.
[27:09.140 --> 27:11.100]  I don't want to give you bad advice.
[27:11.100 --> 27:14.260]  Join us on Embracing Organics Thursday nights on YouTube.

[27:32.140 --> 27:33.140]  All right.
[27:33.140 --> 27:35.020]  I feel like I've been rambling for quite a few minutes here.
[27:35.020 --> 27:39.100]  I have no idea how long this podcast has been going, but I feel like I've done my job for
[27:39.100 --> 27:40.100]  the day.
[27:40.100 --> 27:41.100]  I'm going to wrap up the show.

[28:17.540 --> 28:21.340]  It's amazing to me that this little show has gotten this far.
[28:21.340 --> 28:26.500]  I started off by talking into a microphone with no video, and here we are, 4K video,
[28:26.500 --> 28:28.380]  lighting, lights behind me.
[28:28.380 --> 28:29.780]  This is amazing to me.
[28:29.780 --> 28:30.780]  Thank you.
[28:30.780 --> 28:31.780]  I appreciate it.
[28:31.780 --> 28:32.780]  Couldn't have done it without you.
[28:32.780 --> 28:33.780]  Wouldn't have done it without you.
[28:33.780 --> 28:36.540]  It might be a sign of mental illness if I did this without you.
[28:36.540 --> 28:37.540]  All right.

[29:31.000 --> 29:32.080]  Maybe we'll bring you on the show.
