[00:03.000 --> 00:04.000]  7-10, a big disaster in July.
[00:04.000 --> 00:05.000]  Look out!
[00:05.000 --> 00:06.000]  Bombs are going off.
[00:06.000 --> 00:07.000]  We whip the batter till it's dry.
[00:07.000 --> 00:08.000]  Uh-huh.
[00:08.000 --> 00:09.000]  I love my butter on another matter.
[00:09.000 --> 00:10.000]  Why?
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  Because the tip, the dabber tends to chip the shatter in my eye.
[00:11.000 --> 00:12.000]  Ow!
[00:12.000 --> 00:13.000]  Mic's on set to scorch.
[00:13.000 --> 00:14.000]  Forget the dome as well.
[00:14.000 --> 00:15.000]  Because I'm a vector torch and the microphone's a nail.
[00:15.000 --> 00:16.000]  Yeah.
[00:16.000 --> 00:17.000]  I'm the truth.
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.000]  All you liars go to hell.
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  Every time I grab the mic, it's like a giant show and tell.
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.000]  Well, today I brought it.
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.000]  We've been doing this since way back.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.000]  Way back.
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.000]  I used to get it, but now I'm a mess.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.000]  I'm a mess.
[00:25.000 --> 00:26.000]  I hate it that route, so I backed out and I doubt I'll ever make it back.
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  I see the way you act.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.000]  Uh-huh.
[00:28.000 --> 00:29.000]  Cut the jealous crap.
[00:29.000 --> 00:30.000]  Something's fishy here.

[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  This is our house, but we ain't gotta tell them that.
[00:32.000 --> 00:33.000]  Let's leave them at the front door yelling at the welcome mat.
[00:33.000 --> 00:34.000]  Come on, everybody, get another dab pat.
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.000]  Same routine, slightly different from the last track.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  A million dollars, a million dollars.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.000]  I'm a mess.
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.000]  I'm a mess.
[00:38.000 --> 00:39.000]  I'm a mess.
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.000]  I'm a mess.
[00:40.000 --> 00:41.000]  I'm a mess.
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.000]  I'm a mess.
[00:42.000 --> 00:43.000]  I'm a mess.
[00:43.000 --> 00:44.000]  I'm a mess.
[00:44.000 --> 00:45.000]  I'm a mess.

[04:57.020 --> 05:03.420]  It is five hundred and fifty dollars for one tote of soil. I talked about this last week a tote of soil
[05:03.420 --> 05:08.660]  That's if you pick it up at the store. It's five hundred and fifty dollars. It comes in one bag. It's roots organic soil
[05:08.660 --> 05:10.660]  It's good shit
[05:11.140 --> 05:15.100]  How much is a tote that is approximately in my measurements
[05:15.100 --> 05:20.580]  I think that is about 28 or up is about 48 to 50 seven gallon pots
[05:20.780 --> 05:26.580]  So you can run an eight light setup pretty decently with this one package of soil if you need it delivered
[05:26.580 --> 05:29.540]  It is six hundred dollars. It comes on a FedEx truck to your house
[05:29.740 --> 05:33.340]  So it's not like the Hydro shop is showing up with a truck or anything. It's actually FedEx
[05:33.340 --> 05:35.340]  It looks like you got a package. That's fucking huge
[05:35.940 --> 05:37.300]  That's gonna be a lot of weight
[05:37.300 --> 05:42.080]  So hopefully they can haul it right into your garden area or something. You're not gonna have to deal with moving that

[07:25.460 --> 07:30.060]  They're constantly coming up with good glitter pictures just alone. I mean, yeah, and if you're dabbing
[07:30.660 --> 07:34.940]  Yeah, the reason I have them as a sponsor is because I use their stuff because it's necessity
[07:34.940 --> 07:37.500]  It's useful if you're dabbing you need some oils like products
[07:38.020 --> 07:42.180]  You need something to keep your hash in if you're smoking the live resin that we've got now
[07:42.180 --> 07:44.020]  You don't want to carry it around in parchment paper
[07:44.020 --> 07:49.980]  You want your live resin to be kept in like a nice smooth looking oil slick container my red gold and green Rasta colored oil
[07:49.980 --> 07:53.740]  Slick container on the table with my oil slick pads. It just looks class
[07:53.740 --> 07:57.300]  I got they got these things here with like the magnetic sides to where you can just put your slab
[07:57.300 --> 07:58.900]  I'm gonna have to fucking Google X
[07:58.900 --> 08:01.380]  I'm not sure if that's actually their product or if somebody's making that
[08:01.660 --> 08:05.740]  Modified version because I can't find it on their website, but hey oil slick if you're listening no no
[08:05.740 --> 08:09.260]  We're gonna have to find out because that's a good idea you guys if you have a miniature size slab
[08:09.260 --> 08:11.540]  You can take two of these oil slick
[08:12.060 --> 08:13.580]  mini pads
[08:13.580 --> 08:14.540]  slick pad minis
[08:14.540 --> 08:18.820]  And you can rubber band them together with your slab in the middle or you can find other ways to stick them together and just
[08:18.820 --> 08:20.820]  Have your slab right in the middle make it easily accessible
[08:21.100 --> 08:25.700]  They're great things. I actually use it almost as a I wipe my dabber off on it
[08:25.700 --> 08:27.700]  That's why it's all sticky on this edge near me
[08:28.060 --> 08:30.380]  So I take another dab wipe it off on there
[08:30.380 --> 08:35.380]  My next dad doesn't have residue of my last dab on there every dab is fresh and not only that but I've you know
[08:35.380 --> 08:41.460]  You have seen you use them to set pipes down on just for I usually try to have it like a coaster because the tables
[08:41.460 --> 08:46.340]  Would and I think it's just a little better than fucking dropping my glass onto the table have that little pad underneath it
[08:46.340 --> 08:50.340]  Not all the glass is heavy and thick right and my domes for my domed rigs
[08:50.340 --> 08:54.300]  I know I don't there's one dome drag on the table now that the dome sits on there because you leave
[08:54.300 --> 09:00.180]  I made an ad that said stop leaving sticky rings in your mom's table because everybody's tables got those little rings
[09:00.180 --> 09:02.340]  You could tell who's a dabber and who tries to hide it. Yeah
[09:02.900 --> 09:05.440]  So that's a huge shout out to our friends at oil slick
[09:05.980 --> 09:11.020]  Man oil slicks been a huge sponsor. I totally represent that shit all day long. So thanks guys. Thanks for sponsoring us

[11:26.120 --> 11:31.240]  It's pretty much anyone in Pueblo. This product is unlawful outside the state of Colorado

[11:48.160 --> 11:54.520]  Eggs flour baking soda salt cocoa powder. I'm reading all the whole fucking wrapper. I know but I've got a point peanut butter
[11:55.040 --> 11:57.640]  butter powdered sugar chocolate hash butter
[11:58.640 --> 12:04.680]  Point five grams cannabis weight point five grams dosage 50 milligrams, so this is supposed to be a seven dose
[12:05.680 --> 12:11.000]  Edible here is what they're they have intended. I'm gonna eat the whole damn thing. This is what I have planned right now
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  I've got a napkin. I got a drink. I think this is gonna go down. Well. What's got my attention is it lists other ingredients?
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.600]  it has P
[12:18.600 --> 12:21.680]  51 point nine percent K thirty eight point one percent and
[12:22.360 --> 12:25.360]  Eleven point sorry I should back up nitrogen phosphorus
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.440]  I didn't in the wrong order, but that's you know what I mean now
[12:28.440 --> 12:31.880]  Those are the nutrients used in the plant phosphorus potassium and nitrogen
[12:32.880 --> 12:39.400]  Calcium magnesium sulfur, I don't know what that one means I should but I'm I don't know the table of
[12:41.520 --> 12:45.360]  Yeah, you can't do it either the table of elements I had the periodic table of elements
[12:45.360 --> 12:48.480]  I couldn't say it I was reading these five sugar all texture
[12:48.480 --> 12:51.920]  So they list also what it was grown with and on the bottom here organic neem oil
[12:52.600 --> 12:56.480]  So they also list some of the stuff that was used to treat the plants
[12:57.360 --> 12:59.320]  That's pretty interesting that they list that on there
[12:59.320 --> 13:03.640]  So I know almost everything that went into this product that I'm gonna eat which is kind of kind of nice to know
[13:04.160 --> 13:08.040]  So let's get down to the fucking point. I'm gonna put this edible in my mouth
[13:08.040 --> 13:12.200]  I'm gonna turn up some task rocks. You don't have to hear me chewing it stinks like it
[13:12.800 --> 13:17.440]  I bit it open and as soon as my mouth my teeth broke the seal it smelled like
[13:17.960 --> 13:24.440]  Old school pot food it really smells like cannabis like it's in a smell proof vacuum sealed wrapper
[13:24.440 --> 13:26.200]  I can't tear this wrapper
[13:26.200 --> 13:29.880]  I'm trying to open it up a little more to slide this out easily and it fucking won't rip
[13:29.880 --> 13:32.000]  It's bulletproof you can make parachutes out of this shit
[13:32.880 --> 13:34.880]  greenhouse material
[13:34.920 --> 13:39.560]  I'm almost to the first bite. Oh, man. It's green
[13:42.680 --> 13:44.680]  Holy crap
[13:45.680 --> 13:47.680]  So
[13:49.400 --> 13:51.640]  350 it's gonna have 350
[13:53.640 --> 13:57.720]  It's delicious, yeah, it's a chocolatey and peanut buttery
[13:58.480 --> 14:01.120]  So is it is it almost like an ice cream type of bar?
[14:02.320 --> 14:06.680]  Or does it have a softer? It's like texture, you know, it's not like hard
[14:06.680 --> 14:10.400]  The top layer is straight creamy peanut butter. The bottom layer is soft
[14:11.160 --> 14:13.160]  It's like a almost a soggy brownie
[14:13.680 --> 14:19.840]  But better already, I don't know what that texture is. It's almost a fudge like a nougat. No, it's not than that
[14:19.840 --> 14:22.160]  Okay, I want to give you something. I want to know
[14:22.920 --> 14:28.880]  I want to fucking experience this as I said, I think they have these down here at the shop and speaking of shops
[14:30.680 --> 14:34.240]  It's a peanut butter bar, so whatever they make a penis nature mystic is
[14:35.400 --> 14:38.040]  dude, Publin is a step their game up because
[14:38.840 --> 14:41.160]  You know their bud down there
[14:41.680 --> 14:42.840]  I
[14:42.840 --> 14:44.240]  Feel like driving to Springs
[14:44.240 --> 14:44.760]  Yeah
[14:44.760 --> 14:49.760]  We went to natural mystic cannabis caregivers to pick up some shatter because we were low on shatter and we were just waiting for things
[14:49.760 --> 14:50.800]  to happen
[14:50.800 --> 14:56.080]  And I took Adam Adam doesn't get to go to a lot of dispensaries. I took Adam with me. He's been shopping at Pueblo shops
[14:56.720 --> 15:04.840]  So natural mystic cannabis caregivers blew your mind, huh? It's yeah their bud quality. They were big hard nuggets of
[15:05.680 --> 15:11.120]  Joy, you know like they love those plants there. It wasn't oh, let's see how quickly we can turn this out
[15:12.040 --> 15:14.680]  For number one, I think it was still only medical, right?
[15:15.160 --> 15:21.040]  Yes, that's only medical. Okay, so that's that's one of the you know, one of the reasons but then again
[15:21.040 --> 15:23.600]  There's still medical shops that don't give a damn
[15:23.640 --> 15:25.560]  This is a lot of chocolate and peanut butter
[15:25.560 --> 15:30.800]  If you're like if you're actually sick and have like cancer or something, I don't know that this I'm not knocking the product
[15:30.800 --> 15:34.960]  It's fucking delicious. I get acne from chocolate. Yeah, this would
[15:36.160 --> 15:38.560]  Like while you're eating it it's rich
[15:38.560 --> 15:40.560]  I had a bag of
[15:40.560 --> 15:46.000]  It's supposed to be seven doses and if that's supposed to be seven doses, I'm a good four doses in by now
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.840]  Yeah, yeah and see that last drink that I bought that's what I thought too. You know, I was like
[15:50.840 --> 15:53.160]  I was like I marked lines on it
[15:53.160 --> 15:58.080]  I was like and then I was down to here and I was like, oh well, you know here you're talking about the chai
[15:58.080 --> 16:02.400]  Hi, it wasn't a chai. It may have been that chai. Hi. What's that? What it was called?
[16:02.400 --> 16:05.840]  I don't you showed me the bottle in a picture. Yeah, I don't I don't remember it was so worthless
[16:06.080 --> 16:09.800]  Our little trimmer friend that was here earlier, huh who used to work at a shop
[16:09.800 --> 16:15.080]  She said she used to drink those and sometimes it would wrecker and sometimes it wouldn't do anything to her
[16:15.080 --> 16:18.040]  She said and it may have been that's what she was saying. The lady at the shops
[16:18.040 --> 16:21.960]  He said next time try a fruit flavor and that's what I wanted. I wanted it
[16:21.960 --> 16:26.880]  They had like an apple cider type. Oh, and I was yeah, I was like, yeah, that's me dude all day
[16:27.600 --> 16:29.600]  Southern boy and then they
[16:30.160 --> 16:37.320]  Went all they had was some cappuccino and I like I said, it was like watered-down you who dude there was no cannabis at all
[16:37.320 --> 16:38.880]  like I just
[16:38.880 --> 16:42.640]  When he said watered-down you who did anybody else think of the Beastie Boys song?
[16:44.040 --> 16:49.360]  Professor booty has a song. Yeah, if anybody else knows what I'm talking about tweet me about it. That'd be really cool
[16:49.360 --> 16:56.640]  Just tweet me a hashtag professor booty at agriculture. I'll send you stickers. Yeah, I'll send you an irie genetic sticker or two. Yeah
[16:57.080 --> 16:59.600]  I just like the interaction begging for attention
[17:01.560 --> 17:08.020]  This thing's delicious it reminds me of remember the little Debbie nutty bars. Oh, yeah, it tastes like we're a peanut butter bar
[17:11.280 --> 17:13.280]  Yeah
[17:13.960 --> 17:17.000]  It's better it did the hippie made this I would bet a hippie man
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.920]  This is one of those snacks up. So I was gonna buy another brand because they're delicious
[17:22.680 --> 17:24.520]  I'm
[17:24.520 --> 17:27.560]  Reluctant to say the brand I was opting to buy that I chose this over
[17:27.560 --> 17:32.320]  I was going I asked for a monkey bar because the monkey bars. I love a monkey bar, dude
[17:32.320 --> 17:36.260]  I love from Incredibles. So shout out Incredibles. The monkey bar is delicious
[17:36.260 --> 17:40.600]  I was gonna buy one of those and the girl that works at the lady that works at the dispensary is a friend of mine
[17:40.600 --> 17:46.520]  And also a patient she's a cancer survivor and she uses these products and she said I know you like the Incredibles
[17:47.520 --> 17:53.240]  They're $10 this Mountain Medicine peanut butter bar is $11 and it's got
[17:53.680 --> 17:57.160]  350 milligrams, so it's like three and a half of those for a dollar more and
[17:58.040 --> 18:01.960]  You know the businessman in me didn't take a lot of convincing to say it's three for one
[18:01.960 --> 18:05.800]  I'm gonna do that and I just handed her money and thanked her for being such a great person
[18:07.280 --> 18:10.040]  The flavor so far I am happy with my decision
[18:10.720 --> 18:13.760]  That's cool. I I know that I'm gonna be wrecked
[18:13.880 --> 18:16.480]  So we better get anything out of the way that we need to
[18:17.360 --> 18:20.440]  I'm gonna eat all right. All right be a man. That's it. Yeah, that's what I'm saying
[18:20.440 --> 18:24.000]  Well, cuz you don't know high five and everything. We don't know if it got melted and all
[18:24.520 --> 18:30.120]  350 ran to this bite and all three 50 brandy here as you're saying there's a it's it's almost like a different kind of chocolate
[18:30.120 --> 18:33.400]  I would almost kind of imagine that it you see how right there
[18:33.400 --> 18:38.800]  There's like a big splatches like that's like a chocolate chip or something inside of some peanut butter batter stuff
[18:39.120 --> 18:41.440]  It's got the works dude. It's a layer of
[18:41.440 --> 18:45.480]  Semi dark chocolate over peanut butter with this peanut butter chocolate
[18:46.320 --> 18:51.360]  It's a thick mousse a light fudge sort of a texture. It's uh, I
[18:52.160 --> 18:55.800]  Can eat it quickly and it does it's not so peanut buttery that I'm stuck while I'm trying to talk
[18:55.800 --> 19:00.600]  But it does take a little effort to clean up the face while you're grubbing it and in the summertime eat this in the air
[19:00.600 --> 19:04.880]  Conditioner don't try to take this out anywhere because she told you to kind of put it in the fridge
[19:04.880 --> 19:09.640]  Yeah for five or ten minutes beforehand or she said actually put it in the microwave or warm it up first
[19:09.640 --> 19:13.080]  Oh, yeah, she did. No, this would have been that I don't know that I'd recommend
[19:13.600 --> 19:18.240]  This would just be a puddle. She didn't say long. She said like one second two seconds, you know, but
[19:18.840 --> 19:24.720]  Yeah, take a couple more bites. I think going maybe just put in the refrigerator would be even better
[19:24.720 --> 19:29.400]  Just was there a strain at natural mystic cannabis caregivers that got your attention because they had some great-looking
[19:30.040 --> 19:31.800]  herbs, I
[19:31.800 --> 19:35.800]  Smelled a couple of them. There was only one of them that I really knew what the smell was
[19:35.800 --> 19:38.440]  So, you know, that was my only comparison
[19:39.200 --> 19:44.760]  They had Harlequin there. That was I haven't smelled that yet. And it was wow. It was really potent. What was the
[19:45.320 --> 19:47.320]  What was the other one that we got?
[19:47.880 --> 19:53.000]  Are that you got that day that they had the strain there the Tora Bora? No, no, not the Tora Bora
[19:53.000 --> 19:58.480]  The super lemon haze. No, I can't remember which one they had one. They just stunk to high hell. Yeah, great. Yeah
[19:58.480 --> 20:02.840]  Yeah, that's that's what I'm talking about the one where it's that's what we got some of the shadow of the guava
[20:02.840 --> 20:08.440]  That really impressed me dude that she opened the jar and it was like a punch in the face before she handed it to me
[20:08.440 --> 20:13.000]  Yeah, and I mean, like I said, there was no small nugs in the jar and everything was frosty
[20:13.880 --> 20:19.800]  Everything was right to that point where I feel like I could have brought it home and kept it in my jar for a couple
[20:19.800 --> 20:21.800]  Days and it would have been like, you know
[20:21.800 --> 20:27.440]  I could have judged where how dry or how you tend to like Adam tends to like his weed a little
[20:27.560 --> 20:32.800]  Crispier than most folk. Yeah, I would have been like, you know, I could have judged where how dry or how wet?
[20:32.840 --> 20:38.560]  I'm likes it a little drier. We'd like so we'll cure it perfectly and then give it to Adam to destroy for us. Yeah, exactly, but
[20:39.400 --> 20:44.920]  Still it's it's nice to have that option instead of you where I'm from. It's always dry. So
[20:45.480 --> 20:49.240]  You know you get something wet. You're like, what is this? I'm all in now
[20:49.240 --> 20:50.960]  I just put the rest of this thing in my mouth up
[20:50.960 --> 20:58.000]  I wasn't shitting about that final thing filled with butter because that last bite tastes like butter not even like chocolate or pie butter
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.520]  No, like butter. Oh just butter. Paula Dean made that huh? Yeah
[21:02.400 --> 21:05.760]  So I've never had a chance to say this on like a public platform, but fuck Paula Dean
[21:07.200 --> 21:12.800]  Hey here here. Um, no fuck her before her racism, but extra fucking for her racism
[21:13.680 --> 21:16.320]  I'm trying to get this chocolate. She was always kind of
[21:17.640 --> 21:19.320]  one time
[21:19.320 --> 21:22.880]  so I had an Italian girlfriend and we would watch Giada de Laurentiis and
[21:23.240 --> 21:27.040]  Paula Dean back-to-back and I think Alton Brown was on in the mix
[21:28.240 --> 21:31.160]  Sorry, I'm wiping my face. I got fucking chocolate peanut butter butter
[21:31.520 --> 21:35.040]  All over the place chocolate peanut butter butter. It's good. I could feel the butter on my lips
[21:35.040 --> 21:37.560]  They're like it's tastes like movie theater popcorn in that last bite
[21:38.120 --> 21:42.520]  So Paula Dean one day she's making a meal and she's like this meal got a little some for everybody
[21:42.520 --> 21:46.640]  We'll accept the vegetarians, but screw them. They can go outside and eat grass
[21:47.880 --> 21:52.320]  Fuck you Paula Dean. I'm gonna go outside and eat grass while your shows on and never watch your fucking show again
[21:52.320 --> 21:54.320]  I would go outside eat
[21:54.320 --> 21:56.320]  I'm not gonna go down that road in your podcast
[22:00.120 --> 22:03.600]  I've never really done a fuck you on the show. I feel almost a little bad now, but
[22:04.280 --> 22:06.720]  Suck you racist. You're not fucking rude to vegetarians
[22:07.400 --> 22:12.800]  So I do I would I send her a letter. I was like I will go outside neat grass until Giada de Laurentiis comes back on
[22:13.320 --> 22:15.800]  Yeah, didn't you have a correction?
[22:16.760 --> 22:21.260]  Okay, if you want to get to the point no banter, I didn't know that's cool. Whatever Adam
[22:21.260 --> 22:27.220]  You can drive the podcast today, bro. Hey, I wasn't trying to drive the podcast. I'm correction. You're right. You're totally right
[22:27.220 --> 22:31.220]  I in an edible and you're gonna have to keep me on track. You're gonna have to do that guys
[22:31.220 --> 22:35.420]  We've been smoking live resin. Yeah and unicorn hash
[22:37.020 --> 22:40.380]  And butt naked also known as bear naked depends on where you are
[22:41.220 --> 22:46.740]  If you don't know about the unicorn hash the live resin or the butt naked you don't even know brah that love resin the love
[22:46.740 --> 22:52.060]  Resin that's it. You heard all that shit here first on the agriculture podcast. Remember it you're gonna ask questions later
[22:52.140 --> 22:59.060]  Yeah, we've got answers a correction. I did an episode about veg growth at some point in the episode
[22:59.060 --> 23:04.640]  I said keep your veg plants on 1212. Don't fucking do that. I fucked up
[23:04.640 --> 23:07.940]  I said something wrong was me being a man and telling you I fucking said that wrong
[23:07.940 --> 23:10.300]  I'm correcting myself right now on the air where I have the chance
[23:10.300 --> 23:10.940]  I apologize
[23:10.940 --> 23:14.340]  I am the captain of this ship and I almost drove it into the wall
[23:14.340 --> 23:18.300]  I and see now I feel kind of like an asshole because I forgot it was about that
[23:18.300 --> 23:23.180]  I thought it was something else because I thought you corrected about that last week or the last podcast episode
[23:23.180 --> 23:26.460]  He did so I know that was correcting my now you're pointing out that I fucked up twice
[23:31.140 --> 23:35.460]  No, no awesome, no, I did I that's why I said I'm being a man about it
[23:35.460 --> 23:37.780]  I could just be all no fuck that. We'll just keep talking like that didn't happen
[23:37.780 --> 23:41.620]  No, we got to correct it because we're I'm the captain of this fucking pirate ship right here
[23:41.740 --> 23:44.700]  This is my ship that I'm driving and I got to guide you guys into the right way
[23:44.820 --> 23:47.820]  But we're all gonna fail together and I want you to win is why I'm doing a show
[23:47.820 --> 23:52.020]  I'm trying to improve your growing not fuck it up. Sorry. I'm trying to just the music test got a little loud for me
[23:52.660 --> 23:54.100]  But I want to make your growing better
[23:54.100 --> 23:59.220]  So yeah, my first mistake was I don't even know if I said it on the podcast or in a personal conversation
[23:59.220 --> 24:02.500]  But I mentioned the red light spectrum and I got it totally backwards
[24:02.500 --> 24:07.660]  And then my second mistake was saying to keep your vegging plants on 1212 do not do this
[24:08.100 --> 24:13.100]  Keep your vegging plants on at least 18 hours of at least 16 hours of light
[24:13.620 --> 24:15.620]  18 would be better 24 is what I do
[24:16.620 --> 24:19.140]  To be perfectly fair. You didn't say it like
[24:20.060 --> 24:21.620]  By the way, put your plants
[24:21.620 --> 24:27.460]  no, it was at the end of your sentence at the end of your lesson that the end of your ramble of
[24:28.860 --> 24:35.880]  How lights work so it's probably high. Yeah. Yeah, you would definitely back probably been doing it doing a show for an hour
[24:35.880 --> 24:39.800]  So, excuse me, I apologize, but I admit it I fucked up and I'm driving this
[24:39.800 --> 24:43.800]  But I'm just telling you from a listeners point of view tighten your shit up. I'll be buying more of these edibles
[24:43.800 --> 24:47.880]  All right, that's so good, dude. I've got this chocolate peanut chocolate peanut butter is a pothead Street
[24:48.400 --> 24:54.240]  I've got it in my mouth and it tastes so good. I'm a peanut butter fudge dude from Sonic this song that's popping up right now
[24:54.240 --> 24:56.240]  It's called hashtag and you can't get enough though
[24:57.080 --> 25:00.200]  Perfect because chocolate peanut butter and you can't get enough though
[25:01.080 --> 25:07.800]  Yeah, let me know because I'd like I said I would have definitely been like yo 11 bucks you'll be here over yeah
[25:07.800 --> 25:09.800]  I know you'll see what happens
[25:10.320 --> 25:12.320]  All right. So we did a correction. I
[25:13.600 --> 25:17.480]  Ate the edible goddamn. It's good. We should talk about Jesse's wedding reception
[25:17.480 --> 25:19.840]  I want to give a big shout out to Jesse and burn, of course
[25:20.560 --> 25:23.400]  Mr. Whit I got to meet Jesse's father
[25:24.040 --> 25:27.280]  That's a character there. Yeah, that guy is awesome
[25:27.920 --> 25:32.960]  He can party harder than you and me and then if we cloned each of us and set them next to us
[25:34.320 --> 25:38.960]  He would win the fuck out. He would doubt dab us he would out whiskey us and then he would look at us and be
[25:38.960 --> 25:45.160]  Like why are you guys so fucked up? Yeah. Yeah, he is a professional and he's a man to the man's man world
[25:45.160 --> 25:49.960]  He's a champ. So shout out. It was great meeting you. I think he listens to the show. So a big handshake. Mr
[25:49.960 --> 25:54.000]  Whit I know wedding reception was great. The bride looked beautiful the groom
[25:54.960 --> 26:00.440]  Well, he was pretty awesome so about halfway through the night he decided to wear a young lady's wife beater for the rest of the
[26:00.440 --> 26:01.240]  evening
[26:01.240 --> 26:05.600]  Each nipple stuck out just a little bit and he's quite a hairy man. So it looked great in the beard
[26:06.280 --> 26:08.940]  You looked great through the start of the night, bro
[26:08.940 --> 26:12.600]  And then once you've done to the wife beater I threw up in my mouth a little bit
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.200]  Shout out to the Garden of Weeden crew everybody showed up looking classy as a
[26:20.520 --> 26:24.960]  Motherfucker and I think if you say classy as fuck that describes him perfectly Spence looked sharp as shit
[26:25.160 --> 26:28.880]  Maddie has always looked beautiful. Big Mike was fucking dressed to the nines
[26:30.080 --> 26:36.440]  Joe even brought a skateboard to skate in this cool place. And then of course my my homie sloppy looked sharp as hell
[26:36.840 --> 26:40.560]  Fung we wish you were there, bro. I don't know if you listen to the podcast Fung is out of town
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.360]  We miss you Fung. That's a somber note right there. But at the wedding reception, I didn't go to the actual wedding
[26:46.160 --> 26:51.760]  The pothead crews I was calling us wasn't we chose to just go to the after there was like a wedding and then a
[26:51.760 --> 26:54.560]  Reception and then kind of an after-party that started about 830
[26:55.320 --> 26:57.320]  once the kids bailed out
[26:57.480 --> 27:02.240]  We set up a dab bar and Spence from the Garden of Weeden and myself with also the help of Maddie
[27:02.240 --> 27:05.520]  And if I missed anybody the Garden of Weeden list of people, I'm sorry. I'm trying to do a podcast
[27:05.520 --> 27:08.520]  I got like 9,000 thoughts in my head at once. I don't mean to miss anybody
[27:08.520 --> 27:12.080]  I love all you guys at the Garden of Weeden. So rockin Nana included and even honey
[27:12.600 --> 27:17.560]  So Spence and Maddie and I were pretty much giving out dabs to the entire wedding party
[27:17.560 --> 27:20.240]  that was over 21 and stuck around after the
[27:21.040 --> 27:23.040]  the old folks and the children left
[27:23.560 --> 27:26.760]  Shit, some of the old folks got down better than the youngsters, but uh
[27:27.880 --> 27:29.480]  Did we had an email?
[27:29.480 --> 27:33.320]  We had a regular rig and we couldn't keep up with the dabs that people were
[27:33.880 --> 27:36.600]  Wanting because Jesse handed me his live resin
[27:36.600 --> 27:39.520]  He gave me a nice chunk of live resin to dab out the wedding party
[27:39.560 --> 27:43.320]  So it was my job I volunteered to go there and be the dab tender
[27:43.320 --> 27:47.360]  So we set up a little dab bar. I needed help better. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah
[27:47.360 --> 27:50.960]  He's like, I know you'll fucking give out good dabs and I know you had a know how to manage dab. So
[27:51.600 --> 27:55.440]  Dishing out dabs. I'm getting buzzed. I think from that my head just swirled. That was pretty awesome
[27:55.440 --> 27:58.000]  We'll take a dab here in just a minute, too. We'll slowly watch Jeff degree
[27:58.880 --> 28:00.320]  I'll start melting here
[28:00.320 --> 28:05.520]  If anybody's got that weed if you've seen that commercial that that girl smoked and she fucking melts into the couch and becomes like play-doh
[28:05.520 --> 28:07.520]  It's like a little bit of a commercial
[28:07.520 --> 28:13.280]  Melts into the couch and becomes like play-doh if you have any of that weed and or hash hit me up at I grow culture
[28:13.280 --> 28:18.400]  I'm Twitter. They're lying to you, dude. They've been lying to you. That was photoshop. They don't have the she photoshopped that chick
[28:18.400 --> 28:23.760]  Yeah, I want some of that weed dude. That looks like some great shit. It's that pink stuff in that and that
[28:25.120 --> 28:29.820]  So I think we dished out probably seven to ten grams a live resin last night to the wedding party
[28:29.820 --> 28:31.660]  Some people kept coming back and coming back
[28:32.180 --> 28:39.180]  We probably broke the dab record for Pueblo County in one building at one time with a certain amount of people
[28:39.180 --> 28:41.180]  I don't know what the fucking
[28:42.100 --> 28:45.020]  Dude we we won I'm guessing no team
[28:45.620 --> 28:51.060]  On an average day and people are gonna shit their pants. I take 25 dabs. No problem on an average day
[28:52.060 --> 28:54.140]  Maybe 30 or 40 on a heavy dab day
[28:54.660 --> 29:01.140]  I've gone to secret cups and we've had to judge 42 samples and I've done those all in one day and was okay and went
[29:01.140 --> 29:07.020]  Back for seconds on a couple. So I'm I'm in the 25 to 50 dabs per day range, which I don't know if that's that
[29:08.300 --> 29:09.660]  and
[29:09.660 --> 29:12.440]  When you see the size of dabs he does it is a lot
[29:13.300 --> 29:17.700]  So and what's odd is all I'll wake up and I'll rock for a few hours before I take a dab
[29:17.700 --> 29:21.420]  I try to do a couple things like I try to get food and water in my body and fucking check my email
[29:21.420 --> 29:24.740]  I'm over here. I get to dab dab in a clock at night and you yeah
[29:24.740 --> 29:29.940]  I haven't taken a dab because it will if you take that if you get up a reasonable time somewhere between 8 and 10
[29:29.940 --> 29:34.060]  You know do your day get some food in you get functional get your blood moving
[29:34.060 --> 29:40.060]  It don't take a dab till 7 10 in the afternoon or in the evening you get fucking higher than you would so yeah, but
[29:40.620 --> 29:44.540]  What I was gonna say is I wait until like 6 or 7 or 4 20 lately
[29:44.540 --> 29:46.300]  It's been too hot to get dabbed out all day
[29:46.300 --> 29:51.100]  So you gotta wait until fucking 6 and the Sun starts going down and then by 9 you can get dad the fuck out
[29:51.420 --> 29:53.420]  Then I'll take fucking
[29:54.020 --> 29:59.100]  7 dabs per hour. I'll sit down and take 6 dabs in succession, you know in 20 or 30 minutes
[29:59.100 --> 30:02.420]  You're shaking your head because I ruin you doing it right. Yeah, I just I
[30:03.580 --> 30:05.580]  Feel bad for you, you know
[30:06.660 --> 30:09.420]  That's all you know, I'm sitting here shaking my head
[30:09.420 --> 30:13.660]  I imagine if I was doing bong hits a flower that and see that but that's what I'm thinking though is
[30:14.420 --> 30:19.100]  You know, I smoke flower most of time so it's not sitting there smoking, you know
[30:19.620 --> 30:23.720]  10 bong hits a flower where if I'm just sitting there smoking by myself, it's to
[30:24.340 --> 30:27.420]  Then another four or five hours later or two more, you know
[30:27.700 --> 30:33.220]  So I get what you're saying I I go slower with the dabs and I do with the flower so
[30:34.420 --> 30:39.720]  Less your lungs probably your lungs are like any anything. I think a smoker too
[30:39.720 --> 30:41.820]  So they've got a certain amount of inhales and exhales
[30:41.820 --> 30:47.340]  Your lungs are going to give you before they start to burn out just like any sort of equipment or a fucking device or moving
[30:47.340 --> 30:49.900]  country anything that moves is going to break eventually and
[30:50.620 --> 30:53.460]  If I've only got 72 billion ins and outs
[30:53.460 --> 30:57.740]  I'd rather spend half of those on a dab than three-quarters of them trying to smoke herb
[30:58.460 --> 31:02.840]  Maybe I should just get half of those on oxygen at least but you know what? I mean? I'm turning
[31:02.840 --> 31:07.920]  Hey, no, I get what you're saying and you know, it's understandable my vapor to smoke ratio
[31:07.920 --> 31:10.720]  hey tonight would have been the night that we would have done that event at the
[31:12.540 --> 31:17.500]  Bar owner give an apology to everybody that was excited about that. I myself was excited me too. There were some
[31:18.060 --> 31:22.260]  bureaucracy discrepancies and some stuff that happened and I'm no longer a member of the
[31:22.940 --> 31:27.860]  Citizens for the responsible regulation of cannabis. I don't know if that even exists anymore to tell you the truth. I've backed out of that
[31:28.820 --> 31:32.780]  Just gonna stick with being a breeder and a podcast host and doing what I know. I'm good at
[31:32.780 --> 31:38.480]  I don't like the I used to go to City Council meetings and stuff when I was with it another dispensary group
[31:38.480 --> 31:42.580]  I don't like being in that realm. That's a little uncomfortable to me. I
[31:43.100 --> 31:49.820]  Don't know. I'd rather just it's one thing going there when you have to you know, but when you know, you're just volunteering
[31:50.820 --> 31:54.740]  Voluntarily going there and it still feels like court. Yeah
[31:55.620 --> 32:01.700]  Once you've been to court going in the courtroom type building. It still feels like court. I don't you're just they're judging you
[32:01.700 --> 32:04.660]  Oh completely. Yeah, and they don't I don't feel I
[32:05.220 --> 32:10.120]  backed out of going to those meetings because I felt like I was a hindrance to the group because I'm just a cliche looking
[32:10.120 --> 32:13.260]  Pied and I didn't speak. Anyway, we had spokespeople for the group
[32:13.260 --> 32:18.380]  So I just quit go and you want to know the worst thing that I think about courtrooms is can't wear a hat
[32:19.380 --> 32:23.780]  Yeah, so, you know your long hair you can't hide it from anyone
[32:24.900 --> 32:28.780]  Yeah, you can't hide my dreadlocks. Anyway, but there's no hiding. Yeah, you know
[32:28.780 --> 32:33.860]  So yeah, I was talking about the wedding reception and we got way sidetracked, but that's cool. We're just having a fun episode this time
[32:34.860 --> 32:36.460]  sidetracked ab track
[32:36.460 --> 32:39.060]  We're just having a fun episode. We're not gonna try to do a whole bunch of stuff
[32:39.060 --> 32:41.620]  I may tell you how I dry trimmed some of this weed maybe
[32:42.940 --> 32:47.860]  Just gonna tease about that. The wedding was awesome. I saw a lot of people that I haven't seen in a long time
[32:48.460 --> 32:50.460]  Shout out to bullheaded shout out to
[32:50.940 --> 32:54.780]  Khan Khan performed without booger. I don't know why booger didn't show up, but he still killed it by himself
[32:57.300 --> 33:00.580]  Despicable dialects wrapped who else performed. I know I'm gonna miss somebody
[33:01.700 --> 33:04.860]  Jesse Whit grabbed a microphone and wrapped that was pretty entertaining
[33:06.660 --> 33:09.440]  Yeah, a lot of people did a lot of cool things and it was a great time
[33:09.500 --> 33:12.700]  I'm gonna put in the request for next growth lesson then
[33:14.180 --> 33:16.020]  Freestyle
[33:16.020 --> 33:19.700]  Though all the music's fading out get the music back. Let's get it going. Yeah
[33:21.100 --> 33:22.620]  There it is
[33:22.620 --> 33:26.140]  Yeah, the wedding was awesome. It went off without a hitch. Everything was fun. Everybody got home safely
[33:26.140 --> 33:28.220]  We made sure everybody got home safe because they got kind of silly
[33:28.340 --> 33:29.820]  Some people got a little bit goofy
[33:29.820 --> 33:33.460]  Just want to make sure to give shout outs to the Garden of Weed and crew for running the dab bar like a champ
[33:33.460 --> 33:34.860]  Shout outs to those guys for getting married
[33:34.860 --> 33:38.940]  We'll get off the topic of them getting married. I don't have a lot more left to say about it live resin
[33:38.940 --> 33:40.780]  I keep talking about live resin
[33:40.780 --> 33:47.580]  Everybody's tweeting me messaging me. What is it? WTF live resin? What's great. It tastes great, right less filling
[33:48.460 --> 33:50.460]  It's like a very light
[33:51.340 --> 33:57.700]  Light, let's take a dab love resin. It's funny. Ah, I told I texted I sent Adam a text message saying hey, bro
[33:57.700 --> 34:00.120]  I got some love resin what I actually meant to say it was live resin
[34:00.120 --> 34:02.640]  And so he's been laughing at that ever since that's what it is
[34:02.780 --> 34:06.320]  I'm gonna take and claim take a pretty chunky dab of some live resin right now
[34:06.880 --> 34:11.280]  Some friends that were kind enough to gift me a little bit of live resin super awesome I
[34:12.480 --> 34:17.560]  Hate the torch or heat the nail a little bit less heat and make sure to use the carb cap with the live resin
[34:17.560 --> 34:21.700]  I don't want to burn it up because it's a lot more turpy. It's more turpid oids, you know about turps
[34:21.700 --> 34:25.320]  That's what mostly gives you the flavor. They're flavonoids and paleo. It's that
[34:26.360 --> 34:31.840]  Contribute to that but mostly it's the turpid oids that you want to taste and it's a very clean
[34:32.840 --> 34:35.720]  Yeah, you can see the cleanliness and the clarity in the hash
[34:35.720 --> 34:38.120]  I think I might have talked about it a little on the show. Here we go doing a dab
[34:46.860 --> 34:51.660]  Yeah
[34:52.020 --> 34:58.380]  That was a dab of live resin here take that part tick torch oh
[35:01.420 --> 35:06.740]  My goodness shout out to task rock for making super awesome nails and carb caps
[35:07.220 --> 35:09.740]  Highly educated is not a sponsor of the show, but they should be
[35:10.340 --> 35:12.340]  One day they will be I just got a
[35:12.540 --> 35:14.540]  Task and I've been talking
[35:14.700 --> 35:19.140]  Shout out to highly educated. I'm sorry. I just think of me and dad. So words are complicated right now
[35:19.140 --> 35:23.380]  I'm trying to say that you can pick up highly educated products. He did a little more bro. Sorry
[35:23.380 --> 35:29.740]  I don't even have your dad ready. I'm over here rambling. You can pick up highly educated products at aqua lab technologies comm
[35:29.740 --> 35:36.980]  I recommend if you've got a rig with an 18 or 14 millimeter male joint sticking out of it. I recommend
[35:37.540 --> 35:40.580]  The duality nail that's probably the way to go
[35:41.420 --> 35:47.460]  There it's gonna fit if you've got a 10 millimeter. There is a 10 millimeter dome list that works perfectly as well
[35:48.540 --> 35:54.020]  Catching my breath and get yourself a carb cap carb caps are the new shit and they're awesome
[35:56.420 --> 35:59.820]  You don't have to heat your nail as hot you start you drop your dab in there
[35:59.820 --> 36:03.800]  You let it puddle up a little bit you cover it with the carb cap and it requires less heat
[36:03.800 --> 36:05.900]  So you choke less and your dab tastes a little bit better
[36:06.620 --> 36:10.260]  You'll need a little more heat next time bro. That wasn't too bad. You got a dad but a little more
[36:10.260 --> 36:11.900]  He'll be better for you
[36:11.900 --> 36:16.620]  Let's try not to heat it up because of what you just said. Yeah, there's that you'll find it
[36:16.620 --> 36:19.660]  I usually I counted the ten. I usually heat it for you when you're here, but
[36:20.480 --> 36:22.020]  Once your nail gets a little bit older
[36:22.020 --> 36:25.300]  You'll need to give it a little bit more heat is something that you guys will learn once it starts getting
[36:25.580 --> 36:29.140]  Too too worn out. It's time to replace it by the truth
[36:30.340 --> 36:34.680]  Shout out to task. I'm giving him a big ol ad. He doesn't even sponsor the show. He's just task is a badass
[36:34.720 --> 36:37.220]  He's a he's a pioneer for the community. It's done a lot of shit
[36:37.220 --> 36:40.600]  He's a hell of a rapper to were listening to in the background also, so
[36:41.280 --> 36:42.840]  multitasker
[36:42.840 --> 36:44.840]  multifaceted ingenious man
[36:45.640 --> 36:47.160]  live resin
[36:47.160 --> 36:49.340]  You're ready for this live resin
[36:50.400 --> 36:52.400]  pretty much
[36:52.680 --> 36:57.100]  Take a plant that is growing chop it down at harvest time. It's been flushed
[36:57.100 --> 37:00.240]  You know, I flush in here 10 or 14 days chop it down. It's harvest time
[37:01.800 --> 37:03.800]  Maybe a couple of days ago
[37:04.040 --> 37:06.120]  You went through and pulled off all the big fan leaves
[37:06.120 --> 37:06.720]  All right
[37:06.720 --> 37:10.320]  If not, hang the plant upside down to take off all the fan leaves right now
[37:10.560 --> 37:12.760]  Let it dry for like and you know
[37:12.760 --> 37:17.140]  Some guys are leaving the fan leaves on I should mention that some guys leave the fan leaves on especially frosty strain
[37:17.140 --> 37:19.140]  Let it dry up for like three to four hours
[37:19.360 --> 37:24.880]  Then chop it up into buds and other guys are this is one method I've seen and it varies a little bit
[37:24.880 --> 37:30.240]  But this is basically it chop the buds off the sticks. So you just have the bud buds and leaves
[37:30.840 --> 37:35.760]  You know, you got like a fucking five gallon bucket or so, whatever put that in a freezer
[37:35.760 --> 37:39.320]  If you need to use bags put them in bags and put them in your normal freezer. We've got a fancy freezer
[37:39.320 --> 37:45.680]  We'd be using so freeze your buds get them nice and frozen. They've been putting them in a deep freeze is what I've been seeing
[37:46.440 --> 37:49.160]  Then it's ran through a closed-loop system
[37:50.360 --> 37:55.120]  I'm not there for that part most of the time. No, I'm not a hash maker dried and cured
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.680]  No fresh you cut down the plants. Okay. Good question
[37:59.680 --> 38:01.680]  I'll emphasize that again you cut them down
[38:01.680 --> 38:06.860]  You let them hang for like three to four hours and take off the leaves and then freeze them
[38:07.400 --> 38:13.520]  Okay, that's all they hang to dry right boom frozen chop down frozen and then blasted in the
[38:14.200 --> 38:16.200]  closed-loop system
[38:16.200 --> 38:21.880]  Taken out of the closed-loop system and vacuum purge really really gently and I'm not the hash maker
[38:21.920 --> 38:27.680]  This is the process I have observed and gathered from hanging out with all of my friends that are extract artists
[38:27.680 --> 38:31.120]  all right, that's that's the basics, you know, don't don't rush out and
[38:32.840 --> 38:38.880]  You most people and I sound like an asshole most people don't have access to the machine you need to do this
[38:39.120 --> 38:43.320]  You're not gonna have the machine. There are a couple of specific machines that you need to do this
[38:43.320 --> 38:48.760]  There are only a couple brands and I don't know exactly which to everybody would recommend to fight over
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.840]  So if one of them wants to sponsor the show hit me up. We'll start talking about your machine on the show
[38:53.840 --> 38:57.160]  So maybe someone close to us maybe where would they even?
[38:57.880 --> 39:04.240]  Start to look once this this develops where would they look for a dim Denver? Yeah, Denver's the only place
[39:04.240 --> 39:08.560]  I know if you can get live resin right now. Okay, there was and it's gone now
[39:08.560 --> 39:14.000]  So I'm sorry guys, but it was there it went fucking quickly. There was tangy live resin at the clinic
[39:14.000 --> 39:21.000]  I was 250 bucks for three grams for one of our friends that bought some I think that's $85 a gram is roughly what that
[39:21.480 --> 39:23.760]  But it's you got to thank your pan for the machine
[39:24.560 --> 39:26.720]  Well, and it's kind of the hype
[39:27.560 --> 39:32.480]  That's part of I mean, how many people have you seen on Facebook or anywhere?
[39:32.620 --> 39:38.120]  Yeah, right and it's our crew pretty much the Denver crew has got it figured out the Denver crew is smoking the live resin
[39:38.320 --> 39:39.980]  I'm not sure who came up with it
[39:39.980 --> 39:45.380]  I don't have any I think I think it was giddy up is one of the first people that I ever saw smoking live resin
[39:46.480 --> 39:50.320]  but seen it online, but it didn't look I'm gonna give giddy up and
[39:51.720 --> 39:55.800]  Do I even want to say the other people so it's like giddy up Garden of Weeden
[39:56.240 --> 40:02.040]  Maybe some greener side Empire that crew I'm gonna give them credit for inventing the bare naked and the butt naked
[40:02.760 --> 40:05.340]  Right here the show pretty sure those guys invented that shit
[40:05.340 --> 40:08.760]  That was their idea giddy up was definitely one of the pioneers of that shit
[40:08.760 --> 40:11.600]  And now that I've recovered from my dab, let me tell you Wow
[40:12.600 --> 40:14.600]  Isn't that smooth?
[40:15.160 --> 40:17.800]  People are arguing that it's not cured
[40:17.800 --> 40:23.240]  So it can't be as good that the fucking weed isn't as good because it's not cured before it's blasted is the taste
[40:23.720 --> 40:25.720]  not incredible it is
[40:26.440 --> 40:28.440]  more flavorful than
[40:28.680 --> 40:30.200]  anything if
[40:30.200 --> 40:34.760]  Any any if I've had here if an apple tasted like?
[40:35.600 --> 40:38.440]  Some dank weed. This is Girl Scout cookies
[40:38.440 --> 40:43.120]  We were dabbing if you had a Girl Scout cookies flavored apples and you bit into it
[40:43.160 --> 40:47.920]  You know how apples take a second for that juice to come out of the fiber of the apple and the drip into your mouth
[40:47.920 --> 40:49.920]  Right, is that what like?
[40:50.800 --> 40:56.440]  If you had a weedle a weed apple is that what it would taste like that's what that is where compared to shatter would be
[40:56.440 --> 41:03.480]  Like buying slices from a bag. Yeah, I'm like it's already pre-cut. It's got that air on the on the okay
[41:03.480 --> 41:06.960]  It's not as we're not down great. We're not meaning to downgrade shatter. We're just upgrading
[41:07.400 --> 41:14.560]  Yeah upgrading the live resin that's all upgrade we got the upgrade that's two DS to upgrade
[41:14.960 --> 41:19.800]  Yeah, yeah for a double dose you're from the south if you got two DS and upgrade, buddy
[41:19.800 --> 41:22.760]  You've never seen that movie somebody you'll get it out there and tweet it to you
[41:22.760 --> 41:25.920]  I'm not even gonna let you know hope they do you want to shout out your Twitter address
[41:26.680 --> 41:30.740]  That's over grow the gov had over grow the gov. That's my buddy Adam over here
[41:31.540 --> 41:37.500]  He's from the south so excuse the shit that he says yeah, it should be changed to like Adam with no filter it may
[41:37.980 --> 41:41.860]  You know that's pretty good. That's Adam with no filter over there. Yeah
[41:42.740 --> 41:48.460]  Who cares or just rambling guys? I hope you're having fun on the podcast this time. I've been talking about maybe talking about
[41:49.540 --> 41:55.280]  Talking about maybe talking. I know I was waiting for you to catch. That's why I paused. Oh, dude one more thing one more thing
[41:56.280 --> 42:00.920]  Toot some horns so live resin guys. I hope we explained that enough. We're blasting fresh frozen plants
[42:00.920 --> 42:07.120]  Don't dry them blast them fresh frozen and don't sit vacuum purge it really lightly because the vacuum purge fucks up your terpenoids
[42:07.120 --> 42:09.120]  And it collapses a lot of things
[42:09.240 --> 42:16.520]  If you're doing this process you should know what I'm talking about all the vacuum purge lighter and a little longer
[42:17.040 --> 42:21.600]  Just go lighter and longer less heat don't expect to get shatter through the same process
[42:22.480 --> 42:24.480]  It's
[42:24.720 --> 42:28.720]  Some of it came out shattery some of it is what we're calling sugary, and it looks like we fucked up
[42:28.720 --> 42:34.040]  It looks like old-school hash that we fucked up, but it's almost clear it tastes. Oh my gosh, dude
[42:34.040 --> 42:40.640]  It is and that's and I'm higher from it. Yeah, it's uh it's a cleaner. I don't cough. Yeah, I don't cough from doesn't I do
[42:40.640 --> 42:44.880]  Cuz I smoke so well if I take you know I don't I don't die from it
[42:44.880 --> 42:49.080]  I don't know if I could do a half gram dab of live resin that why would you want to though because I like dropping
[42:49.080 --> 42:51.680]  Half-gram dabs of fucking regular shatter. I like that
[42:52.040 --> 42:58.080]  They're like kicking the dick kind of feeling that it gives you and I guess on my level sometimes it takes a half-gram dab
[42:58.560 --> 43:00.560]  YouTube video in the making
[43:01.200 --> 43:06.680]  How much live resin is on this little sheet right now? No you should that's not even big enough to be impressive all right yet
[43:06.680 --> 43:10.240]  Yeah, that's a lot of library. It's a fucking dude $85 a gram at the clinic. Yeah
[43:10.240 --> 43:14.880]  No, I'm gonna drop a $45 gram or $45 dab this coming from the man
[43:14.880 --> 43:17.480]  Who has burned quite a few things that I don't even want to talk about?
[43:18.480 --> 43:24.840]  I'll post that picture up. I'll post a picture somewhere. He's talking about me burning things. It was $100 bill. It was the 4th of July
[43:26.280 --> 43:28.280]  Post that picture one day somewhere
[43:29.480 --> 43:31.000]  If that's not a crime I
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.240]  Resort I was afraid to post it up because I thought that me I may get in trouble for that
[43:34.240 --> 43:39.600]  It's not it's not a crime. It's an actual form of protest. That's acceptable. It's a political protest. Yeah
[43:40.200 --> 43:44.640]  Isn't that random you guys I burned $100 bill. There's a story behind that one. There's
[43:45.200 --> 43:50.880]  Well there were $200 bill yeah, there's a story behind it so it's a really good story behind it
[43:50.880 --> 43:54.240]  It is maybe next year. I might have to edit that part out, but you never know
[43:55.640 --> 43:58.220]  And we also said somebody's last name that I may have to edit out
[43:59.160 --> 44:03.380]  I'm not gonna repeat it if you guys didn't catch it the first time then you didn't catch it
[44:03.840 --> 44:05.360]  So I'm gonna toot my own horn
[44:05.360 --> 44:12.360]  But also I'm going to recommend that you guys go and check out cannabis sativa the essential guide to the world's finest marijuana strains
[44:12.400 --> 44:18.000]  Edited by ST owner the name is stoner. This is volume 3 released by green candy press

[44:23.600 --> 44:28.040]  I'm not sure that it's even out yet, but when it comes out you got to get this fucking book dude because on page
[44:28.560 --> 44:32.220]  I think it's 45 or 54 I suffer from it's 54

[44:39.280 --> 44:41.280]  Took those pictures. Yeah, thanks a lot
[44:41.440 --> 44:43.440]  I'm just joking I
[44:43.560 --> 44:46.160]  Actually took those pictures with a an Olympus
[44:47.760 --> 44:52.360]  What's it called now I can't remember the fucking course it's a little Olympus camera. It's not even anything fancy
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.280]  It's a Panasonic Olympus, it's just a little 16
[44:58.320 --> 45:03.880]  Fucking it's got a real good zoom. It's got a 16x zoom on it is what's real nice about it and that thing took
[45:04.320 --> 45:09.040]  All the pictures in this were taken with that cheap as a $200 camera from Best Buy
[45:09.960 --> 45:13.040]  Yeah, so it's published in a book guys that should be
[45:13.960 --> 45:16.440]  So thanks. I want to give a shout out to them. Thanks for putting me in the book
[45:16.440 --> 45:19.720]  I also want you guys to look at the book support these guys. They put out great
[45:20.240 --> 45:21.800]  strain guides
[45:21.800 --> 45:23.800]  the description I
[45:25.360 --> 45:28.360]  Wrote some of it and then it was
[45:29.280 --> 45:32.040]  Given some Liberty. I think is what I'm trying to say
[45:32.040 --> 45:38.080]  I didn't write that the way that it's written there so and I also am NOT taking credit for creating golden goat
[45:38.080 --> 45:44.040]  I did not create golden goat guy named mr. Dank from Kansas created the golden goat and
[45:44.840 --> 45:48.520]  That was not me. I simply put it into seed form. It's in feminized seed
[45:49.680 --> 45:53.800]  Unfortunately right now it's sold out, but there'll be more made a wink so fast. Do you see?
[45:54.280 --> 46:01.400]  seeds I made a test batch and they went pretty quickly to all my test crew and they showed fucking huge potential and they looked
[46:01.400 --> 46:04.540]  Like golden goat mommy so then I made more and I put them online
[46:05.060 --> 46:11.620]  Banging they were gone dude. That's awesome. Yeah, shout out to nature's green remedies. Yeah, those boys know how to hustle

[46:21.380 --> 46:26.700]  The strain guides are important now that we're getting into the medical marijuana stuff and it's getting to be legal everywhere people are gonna want
[46:26.700 --> 46:28.460]  to know about these strains and
[46:28.460 --> 46:30.180]  They're gonna be growing all this crazy shit

[50:48.220 --> 50:52.580]  And make her extremely jealous. There we go. That's really give a shout out to I'll give a shout out to my wife
[50:52.580 --> 50:55.940]  That's a good idea. She's sitting at home. I'm sitting here dabbing so
[50:57.300 --> 50:59.300]  Good night
[50:59.740 --> 51:02.660]  Not you guys just as why yeah, good night Christie
[51:03.620 --> 51:06.100]  Drop the torch. I thought that was a rig dude
[51:06.940 --> 51:10.160]  That was a door my heart drop I did at the edge of the table because it was hot yeah
[51:12.460 --> 51:14.460]  It scared me though
[51:14.700 --> 51:18.340]  That fat dab of live resin after how high I was from that edible
[51:20.140 --> 51:23.820]  This is gonna be a fun end of a show section if it ends Oh
[51:24.620 --> 51:28.700]  If it ends, can we just podcast? I think definitely I think we got everything
[51:28.700 --> 51:29.820]  Yeah, we could do a live feed
[51:29.820 --> 51:35.420]  Can you ever uh Google hang out and just then release it you ever eat an LSD where you got into that bubble where you?
[51:35.420 --> 51:39.100]  Don't want to leave where you are because you're just like I'm here, and I'm safe. Yeah, absolutely
[51:39.740 --> 51:44.660]  So that's how the podcast has me right now. I'm secure. I've got my little station right here. I got some dabs
[51:44.660 --> 51:49.860]  I got a drink. I got a book to read if something goes wrong. I got the internet. I got my little station
[51:49.860 --> 51:53.460]  I'm the Internet's back. Oh the Internet is back the Internet was down here
[51:54.180 --> 51:57.220]  Comcast come on dude. You're expensive. I wasn't even gonna say the c-word
[51:58.340 --> 52:02.260]  Cast yeah, they're so expensive. They should work come on guys get it together
[52:02.340 --> 52:03.580]  It's not that they should work
[52:03.580 --> 52:10.920]  They should work past 12 o'clock to 4 o'clock because unlike them other people do things at those hours
[52:10.920 --> 52:12.920]  yeah, and it's like
[52:13.260 --> 52:19.120]  You know I'm not gonna say what people do I'm just gonna say that people need to do that yeah on the internet
[52:19.620 --> 52:21.700]  Alright guys after I finish this cough
[52:23.020 --> 52:29.540]  Here we go with a miniature grow lesson on dry trimming and bear in mind. I ate a 350 milligram edible that is highly effective
[52:30.100 --> 52:34.260]  I'll get him to slow down a little bit. It's fucking working. Yeah, Adam will help us out so
[52:34.900 --> 52:39.480]  I'll even turn down the music because it's highly distracting cuz I love these songs task rocks awesome in my opinion
[52:41.220 --> 52:43.220]  Dry trim
[52:43.460 --> 52:46.820]  Wear rubber gloves for almost all of everything that I'm talking about
[52:48.500 --> 52:55.700]  Get the the blue nitrile gloves those are those are great. They're cheap. They got a mint like Walmart and Walgreens. They're affordable
[52:56.220 --> 52:58.340]  Whoa, I'm high here. We go so
[53:00.020 --> 53:03.820]  Pull the plan out of the room I guess and just chop it down to the base and then hang it upside down
[53:03.820 --> 53:10.020]  I use that bottom branch the very bottom branch where the first fucking set of buds are I hang that over
[53:11.060 --> 53:16.180]  Sometimes you could string up a line across the room or maybe use like a coat hanger depending on how many I've going on but
[53:16.420 --> 53:20.660]  Wherever you're hanging it. That's your new little hanger that little why that first intersection, and then I'll grab like a
[53:21.300 --> 53:24.540]  Fuzzy stick pack of fuzzy sticks from Walmart. It's kind of like a pipe cleaner
[53:26.180 --> 53:27.860]  Anything like that
[53:27.860 --> 53:30.200]  Fucking the thing around your bread bag
[53:30.200 --> 53:34.860]  They got a bunch of those kind of things a little twisty tie sort of thing wrap that around this stock and just kind of
[53:34.860 --> 53:36.860]  Secure it on to whatever you're hanging it to a little bit
[53:37.180 --> 53:39.820]  Because sometimes that branch will break if you got a heavy plant
[53:40.500 --> 53:42.500]  You want to go to the second branch go for that?
[53:42.940 --> 53:46.380]  Secure it on there a little bit. I like to secure it either way just cuz I'm fucking OCD
[53:46.380 --> 53:51.680]  I don't want my plants falling on the floor after they've been growing for fucking 125 days or something
[53:52.540 --> 53:57.280]  You're gonna be alright princess. You're turning colors. Hey, don't call me princess. You'd be lucky to talk
[53:57.980 --> 54:02.100]  Yeah, yeah this this edible works if you guys want to buy an edible I
[54:03.060 --> 54:07.380]  Recommend the mountain medicine your tolerance. Yeah, dude half of it, dude
[54:07.380 --> 54:10.420]  If you don't even do that eat a quarter if you were I'm high yeah
[54:12.260 --> 54:14.540]  Working for you, I know it's gonna work for me
[54:14.540 --> 54:19.980]  I like to say I'm a professional and this is fucking me up in such a good way when I bought that
[54:20.420 --> 54:25.300]  315 milligram drink I thought that it was gonna fuck me up. I mean you literally told me I want one
[54:25.300 --> 54:29.220]  I wish we could play some Grateful Dead music without getting the show in trouble right now. That's where I am
[54:29.220 --> 54:32.380]  Hi, I want to listen to Jack straw if anybody's a deadhead out there
[54:32.380 --> 54:34.980]  You know where I am if I say I just need to hear Jack straw man
[54:35.340 --> 54:39.660]  Somebody knows where you are. Somebody knows where I am. Somebody weren't a fucking tie-dyed shirt is out there going
[54:39.660 --> 54:41.660]  Yeah, man, and they're gonna play Jack straw for me
[54:42.260 --> 54:43.380]  Alright
[54:43.380 --> 54:45.500]  So we got the plant it's hanging upside down, right?
[54:46.300 --> 54:49.300]  You need to get off the fan leaves now is a good time to do that
[54:49.380 --> 54:52.220]  Maybe you did that some growers do that a few days before harvest
[54:52.220 --> 54:56.700]  Maybe I should have recommended that maybe a few days before harvest go in there and take off all your big families
[54:57.180 --> 55:00.220]  Or you can do that right as you harvest or you can do it as it's hanging up
[55:00.220 --> 55:02.220]  Just get those big fan leaves off
[55:02.580 --> 55:04.640]  Now your plants are hanging upside down in a room
[55:05.580 --> 55:07.580]  you want that room it like
[55:08.500 --> 55:10.700]  Fuck I should have wrote this down because I'm getting really high
[55:10.900 --> 55:14.020]  You don't want a lot of humidity in there maybe like 25 to 30 percent max
[55:14.540 --> 55:17.380]  Maximum humidity and then and you want to have some air
[55:17.900 --> 55:22.540]  Moving but not like your fans blowing directly on the plants that'll crisp them up a little too quickly
[55:22.540 --> 55:24.780]  You want them to dry a little bit slowly while they're hanging upside down?
[55:25.100 --> 55:29.880]  So you got a whole plants hanging upside down minus family. It's just hanging upside down. The humidity is kind of low
[55:30.420 --> 55:32.420]  Keep your temperatures
[55:32.460 --> 55:37.880]  You don't want to go cold, but you don't want to go hot either. So like 70 75 is like right
[55:37.880 --> 55:43.460]  Well, you know right the same that's a good area like what they like. Yeah. Yeah where you are is where they're cool
[55:44.140 --> 55:47.980]  Yeah, I might hang kind of like in a work area where it's a little dark keep it dark in there
[55:48.820 --> 55:52.860]  And I could I would imagine it could go to possibly 80, you know
[55:52.860 --> 55:59.660]  Like it 80 would probably don't crisp them up a little faster than you want. But you know, yeah closet if you have to you know
[55:59.660 --> 56:02.220]  Like that type just make sure you're getting air to them
[56:02.220 --> 56:08.620]  If you are doing like a closet or something air because moving air prevents mold just remember that in every gross situation
[56:09.220 --> 56:12.180]  moving more air prevents mold that's like one of the
[56:12.980 --> 56:13.980]  Growing is humid
[56:13.980 --> 56:19.580]  You may not even realize how much water is involved in growing but every gallon you pour in is coming back out somewhere
[56:19.580 --> 56:23.460]  Mm-hmm, and you got to move that you got to get rid of it or utilize it somehow
[56:23.460 --> 56:28.620]  So you got these plants are upside down. They're in the room with the right humidity. They're in the room with the right temperature
[56:28.620 --> 56:30.620]  Hopefully it's dark, right?
[56:30.940 --> 56:32.940]  As dark as you can get it
[56:33.140 --> 56:36.420]  You got to dedicate space. You got a lot of air moving so you don't get moldy now
[56:36.420 --> 56:41.380]  Just let them dry up for shit. I've got some that have been hanging the plants we trim tonight
[56:41.380 --> 56:42.820]  We're cut down
[56:42.820 --> 56:46.300]  On a Monday, so they've almost been going for two weeks hanging up there
[56:46.300 --> 56:50.060]  And it's been a little a little humid because we've had a swamp cooler going in that area
[56:50.380 --> 56:54.260]  Not in that area, but in a room like three at a hallway down
[56:54.260 --> 56:57.540]  I guess there's a swamp cooler in there just because that's what that room came equipped with
[56:57.540 --> 56:59.180]  So we got a really closed area
[56:59.180 --> 57:04.420]  Yeah, but it's still getting it's still it still makes a little humidity in the rest of the the grow environment
[57:04.420 --> 57:06.420]  so where they're sitting there hanging for about a
[57:07.420 --> 57:10.540]  14 days is where they've been and they don't have any fan leaves on them
[57:10.540 --> 57:12.660]  You might want to check them every other day
[57:12.820 --> 57:16.060]  Every day like start checking about four days five days six days
[57:16.060 --> 57:21.380]  Give them a little squeeze and when those families are the little sugar leaves start crisping right off just by hitting them with your finger
[57:21.820 --> 57:25.580]  Grab those plants and just take like I've had these long bins
[57:25.580 --> 57:30.200]  And I just take branches off the I have the plants hanging I cut branches off and lay them into the bins and once my
[57:30.200 --> 57:33.380]  Bins are full I go to a seated area cuz you got to sit down to trim dude
[57:33.940 --> 57:37.220]  Man, it'll drive you nuts trying to stand up. I'm getting old. That's how I know I'm old
[57:37.220 --> 57:38.660]  I can't stand to trim anymore
[57:38.660 --> 57:40.300]  so you got to sit down and
[57:40.300 --> 57:43.580]  I just kind of hold I cut one butt off at a time and
[57:43.900 --> 57:46.780]  Just knock the leaves off of it with my thumbs because now that it's dry
[57:47.100 --> 57:51.420]  Those leaves are pretty much just gonna fall off and you can see what your finished product is as you're going
[57:51.420 --> 57:55.920]  So trim it to your liking at this point if you're selling it to fucking
[57:56.460 --> 58:00.760]  For stupid cheap a pound and just hustle and wait to get it out. Don't trim it worth a shit
[58:00.760 --> 58:07.320]  That's why cheap weed is cheap if you want connoisseur grade weed take your time and trim it and wear rubber gloves. Yeah. Yeah
[58:07.720 --> 58:09.720]  Yeah, please. I don't want to smoke all your
[58:10.440 --> 58:16.200]  Skin your week if your weeds that sticky then definitely wear rubber gloves and then have something to be proud of
[58:17.120 --> 58:19.120]  Adam loves the finger hash
[58:20.480 --> 58:22.480]  You can like rub you'll learn how to
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.540]  Don't scrape the fucking latex right out of that shit
[58:25.540 --> 58:30.740]  But you'll learn how to rub the the hash off of your fingers and make like a little hash ball or a little hash
[58:30.740 --> 58:32.740]  watch a watch a video on
[58:33.140 --> 58:34.700]  making
[58:34.700 --> 58:38.220]  What was it called? You know what I'm talking about? No, I don't cuz you're saying it
[58:39.220 --> 58:41.220]  Oh the hand hash
[58:43.100 --> 58:47.980]  Chorus there you watch a video on how to make chorus and it'll you'll figure out real quick
[58:47.980 --> 58:50.860]  Yeah, so the buds are pretty much dry, right?
[58:51.460 --> 58:54.920]  We've got them in the room. They hung they're crispy now. We're hand trimming them
[58:55.200 --> 58:58.640]  Cut off like you got a bunch of sticks in a band and take that fucking stick
[58:58.640 --> 59:02.040]  You cut off a little individual buds and you just knock the leaves off with your thumbs
[59:02.040 --> 59:05.880]  You can use scissors now if you want, but it's kind of pointless. I am faster. Just thumbing it
[59:05.880 --> 59:07.480]  It looks like you're playing Nintendo with the button your hand
[59:07.480 --> 59:13.060]  You're like just going up it should just take you a couple seconds to get each bud and you can see I like I said
[59:13.060 --> 59:16.240]  You can see the finished result and what's really cool is if you wet trim
[59:16.680 --> 59:22.280]  you got to trim it and you're all sticky and it fucks up your scissors and it takes so long and
[59:22.640 --> 59:28.080]  Every time you set a bud down or touch a bud it fucking sticky there and stickier and sticky here
[59:28.840 --> 59:30.840]  Dry trimming is way cleaner
[59:31.480 --> 59:35.760]  And this may sound weird, but as soon as you're done trimming you can weigh your shit like
[59:37.280 --> 59:42.960]  This is how much I have yay and it's done and leaves not pull out moisture. Anyways, I mean they're essentially
[59:43.480 --> 59:48.040]  Yeah, it's ideal to leave them, you know, like they're they're ducks to for the the place
[59:48.160 --> 59:54.000]  They're what's struggling to suck up the moisture not the the bud really I would imagine that's yeah, that's mostly right
[59:54.000 --> 59:57.920]  But also it helps slow it down because you want the water to leave more slowly
[59:58.120 --> 01:00:02.280]  Okay, because that lets the the chlorophyll evaporates with the water
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.960]  So once the water is gone, you can't take away any more chlorophyll
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:09.900]  But if you let the water come out slowly, then that chlorophyll dissolves with the water and goes away. Okay?
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:15.920]  Yeah, and it happens in the cure process. Also you start the gases start convert. We're getting into cure. That's different. Oh, yeah
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.120]  Yeah, we'll go there later, yeah, it's just I
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:24.400]  Can tell you now like most the videos that I've made it an hour and I'm high as shit on that edible
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.520]  It only took like 45 minutes to kick in. I'm a little better now
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:32.280]  I've calmed down but for a minute there I was really high your hands are still like on your chair
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:44.760]  Guys seriously, if you are not an experienced and don't try to be cool because I smoke a lot of dabs
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.920]  You'll be that lady from NBC or whatever. Yeah, dude, you'll be writing a story about freaking out. No, you'll piss your pants
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:56.840]  Yeah, don't eat 350 milligrams unless you're experienced because you will piss your pants and being a bad example on my own podcast
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:03.140]  No, I'm sorry. Like you said you were you were an experienced dude. You're in the comfortable ability of your own home
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:05.140]  You got a homie here. You're good
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.200]  Like you're you're in the perfect spot to do this to be like I'm going to this is no different than
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:18.660]  Drinking a bottle of tequila. I'm not gonna drive. I'm not gonna go anywhere. Nope. I may I may troll the internet
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.480]  Most trouble I'm gonna be tonight. Yep. Yep. You're good crap
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.140]  So did we get through trim and weed cuz I'm high? Yeah, you did. I think I always say are we done trim and weed?
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.840]  That's yeah
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.720]  You can tell how many times a grower or a
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.760]  Person in the trim circle has been around pot by how fucking eager they are to trim if you're like, are we gonna trim tonight?
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.000]  I'm so excited. It's like your second third, maybe fourth time
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.400]  Yeah, if you're like, hey, I got a fucking trim a bunch of weed tonight. You're an experienced grower
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:57.560]  You've had a couple of crops down. Yeah, I still love it. I love it and hate it
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.800]  I love it because I get to finally check out my babies
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:05.720]  I get to see like oh here we go get to fucking take those pretty flowers and I'm blasting into shatters
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.440]  No, I'm just kidding
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:11.200]  I get to take all that trim and make shatter and that's one cool thing about dry trim as soon as you're done dry trimming
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:15.820]  You can haul that trim off over to your extract artist guy and you can do his thing with it
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.380]  I've cured trim before and blasted it it was
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:27.800]  Very very unnoticeably different. Yeah, couldn't tell the difference between batches. Some people say that's not if your weeds good you
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.800]  Yeah, you know, yeah, I cut down crops really if I'm making hash out of the whole plant
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.400]  Sometimes we'll run or run Girl Scout cookies whole plants and just make dabs out of it
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:44.560]  I'll cut it down a little bit early just a little bit early. I like to take it 63 days
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:49.120]  Usually I'll cut it down to like 55 56 right at the end of eight weeks like a mocha
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:56.320]  Frappuccino, it's got that dirt coffee chocolate taste in there. So good. Mmm Girl Scout cookies hash you guys
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.840]  Man, let's put some music in the background again
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.000]  I turned it down to give that girl lesson and talk and it

[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:53.940]  Do you feel like you could
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.780]  Derail at any moment. No, no, I'm not
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.520]  You feel like you've died and nobody will tell you no

[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.680]  He's all fucking sloppy today
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.220]  Shut up sloppy
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.700]  It's been an hour dude, what else do you want to cover that?
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.540]  Fuck up the grow tip, please

[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:44.940]  I'll try to tell you the right stuff. It's not about correcting you. It's just about I want to get people not getting the wrong
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.940]  That's exactly it. That's and yeah, I want you guys to do it, right?
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.260]  Like I said, I'm the captain of this pirate ship
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.160]  With an eye hard dab shirt on making I am wearing the eye hard dab shirt
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.060]  Not yet, yeah, it takes more dabs
[01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:17.640]  I'm not you're probably you can let's take another dab
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:24.060]  There's probably just enough for two dabs of live resin on this little piece of I feel bad for we're smoking up all your life
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.060]  Resin, oh, no, that's what it's for us
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.180]  It doesn't do any good sitting on a piece of parchment paper
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:36.060]  I just want to as a somebody else sitting here at the table. I want to share the wealth and like goodness, man
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:40.960]  You contributed to a hell of a podcast your close friends definitely deserve
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.040]  So anybody out there listening that is one of you folks
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.280]  You know
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.880]  Well, let's skip this song watch
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:55.760]  It's just a little skit. We don't need to listen to a skit on the podcast. That's awkward. Oh, yeah torch furnace
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.380]  There it is. We're running out of butane. We're gonna have to switch to the email pretty soon
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:05.700]  You came prepared though. I came by got the email sitting on the table right here with the highly educated infinity nail rigged up
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.360]  ready to go
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.360]  it
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:16.120]  It's impressive to say the least yeah, it's only a second time I've seen it but um
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.960]  From the south we don't have no fancy shit like that. I had the bomb you mean electricity. Yeah
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:33.240]  To the south only Adam yeah, yeah, that's lately me. Yeah, I'm just Adam in his trailer park. I got a small town
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:38.720]  Yeah, I got it enough for everybody the railroad tracks behind his trailer park. This is the power plant. Oh, man
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.720]  Yeah, is that why you're kind of mutated?
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.760]  it's
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.920]  It's debilitating is what it is to get any government grants from any of that. No, you don't
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.600]  unfortunately, they just want to like do a bunch of studies and
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.080]  Research, you know
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:59.800]  But we know I like I said, I've had the bong for the past 10 years or so
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.560]  You know, everybody would come around to smoke my dual chamber water ice-cooled bong. It was amazing
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.160]  I've never seen it. How much did you pay for that $400?
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:10.800]  No, man
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.800]  a lot of the people that are coming here to buy the
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.880]  Rec weed or straight up from the south they drive all the way out here on a weekend this or Florida
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.880]  It's the same damn thing
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:25.320]  As you driving it from fucking Florida to Colorado. No, there's medical in other states
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.200]  Um, yeah, but you can't go there and get it as easily
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:32.240]  Yeah, you know and like you have to prove residency, you know
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.200]  That if you're in sorry, I'm totally interrupting you
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:41.840]  If you're in Pueblo, Colorado, and you're on the very south end of Pueblo at mile marker exit 91
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:48.600]  Hit that exit and then as you come off the exit you need to go north just a little bit from the exit
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.720]  And there is the greener side dispensary and there's a certain time period
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.640]  in the early evening right as the Sun sets the
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:03.800]  LED UFO lights come on in the greenhouse to keep the plants from flowering early right the bloom season
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.200]  from about a mile and a half away this fucking
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.200]  120 by 30 foot greenhouse. I think it is
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:18.760]  Illuminates this purple blue spectrum and if you don't know what it is, it is the craziest looking fucking thing ever, dude
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.600]  It was all lit up last night when I was out there. That's crazy
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:26.400]  I was just driving past but I was on I-25 and as you look over like what the fuck
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:33.560]  It looks like aliens are landing bro. That would be a cool thing to like fucking really fucking wreck her and take her out
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:40.760]  So just go to the greener side dispensary and buy yourself hey, there you go can recreational cannabis it's on there open
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:45.480]  I'm so like a lot. You can go out there around 7 7 30 and I
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  Don't recommend that but yeah
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.400]  You could probably call them and ask him what time the UFO lights come on and tell him that you want to come check out
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:57.000]  And they'll probably tell you what time those turn off because I they change there, you know, there it's a greenhouse
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.720]  So the schedule is gonna change. They're just trying to do it to keep the plants come visit into flower early fun people
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:09.720]  There's tons of fun stuff to do here. We got a Frisbee Golf Park. Look out disc golf disc golf are any good?
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.720]  No, I've never played my I miss I miss why I went out there and got really high
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:20.400]  Yeah, it's pretty much the point chase the Frisbee and fucking smokes and balls and they were like dude if you just bring a couple
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:24.120]  Joints, I'm sure and I went out there and I was like I got joints and they're like nah, dude
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.120]  We don't we don't want your weed and I'm I don't blame you
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.560]  Yeah, definitely who were these guys

[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.760]  So that's that
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.320]  Did you take a dab or did I just take one of these stingy?
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:06.600]  I don't fucking know if there's some left here. That means I didn't share it. Yeah, there's a little left here
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.080]  Oh, I didn't even see you take one. Yeah, I took it dude. That's
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.680]  You
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:16.520]  Nothing took a dab because it's the divers clean I must have
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.720]  You sure didn't just like drop off my side of your computer like a hundred and thirty seven percent sure
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:29.360]  Which is that's all right. That's a big percent. Yeah, I don't know if that exists
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:34.080]  There's some accountant out there pulling his hair out right now going. Fuck you. You can't have 137 percent
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:40.360]  Then again, they don't come to the agriculture podcast for statistics they haven't seen how many grams per watt I pull
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:49.020]  Hey listen to the podcast and you'll you might grow yourself and find out oh, oh, yeah grams per watt
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:55.560]  I heard this girl say she can pull two plus pounds of Kong per thousand watt light. She was using a 4x8
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.840]  fucking botanic hair trays on tables like elevated
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.560]  With fucking lights every 5000 watt lights every five feet and rows of five lights
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.760]  Yeah, that's a lot of details for the chicks room, but she's claiming that you pull
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.200]  I and I'm not doubting her but she's saying that she pulls fucking two plus pounds of Kong per fucking cycle
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.960]  Just to be funny a lot of details would have been like address
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:26.480]  When she's gonna be there, you know, that's a fucking that's a fat pool if she's doing that props. Yeah, hey, but then again

[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.720]  dick pics

[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:53.320]  Pretty sure that's the first she likes the penis reference on the podcast. It is surprised it wasn't from Wade
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:00.360]  It's pretty dope task rock song hip-hops it gets going is it time to end the podcast?
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.000]  We've been going at for an hour 13 minutes
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.680]  Anything cool to say or podcast you wanted to hang out and do a random episode?
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:09.440]  So I wanted to fucking kind of roll with that. I don't know if we got enough random man. It feels random
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:14.240]  I feel like I fucked up a girl lesson people count on me and I'm super high. So well ask for details
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.560]  So what do we do after we you got the leaves bucked off?
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.280]  You throw them in a bucket and let them sit there for a couple days
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.000]  Crisp up and then after that you put them in a jar and start curing
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.680]  That's from there is curing and I don't know if I want to get into curing yet. That's yeah
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.560]  I want to talk about this when I'm not wrecked
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.480]  So I'm gonna write that down and fucking in two or three episodes from now. Guess what?
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:39.240]  We'll do hearing here some weed. That's right. I mean, that's a I know we went way out of order because we're only in veg
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.300]  And that actual lessons, but I was trimming weed tonight
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:46.580]  Crispy and a lot of people don't even know you know, I'm saying I they'd literally think you dry it and that's it
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:51.440]  Now it's got to get cured a little bit from now. I mean you could I understand that you could if you're sending it out
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.780]  Of town right?
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:55.900]  But if you're gonna smoke yourself or with your homies or use it for medical purposes
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.900]  We got a cure right now. You want to be proud of it?
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:04.740]  You know, holy crap that edible is bubbling up in my stomach and made me burp all kinds and it tastes like fucking weed and
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.100]  fucking peanut butter
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:12.620]  Yeah, let's in this podcast up while we're still all sane by the way
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:17.020]  I ate 350 milligrams of cannabis edibles and I'm okay, but I don't recommend that you do that
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.740]  I can't advocate that type of use of recommend this package says 50 milligrams
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.300]  I'm gonna say start with 25 or 50 milligrams
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:27.240]  Technical I dared you to do it. So it's the dare you had to do it
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:31.180]  I know I'm fucking them but I'd done it without your daring. Sure. I like to eat a lot of edibles
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:37.000]  This thing got me high good. It comes in waves. Is it worth $11?
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.100]  To me. Yes
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:45.740]  It depends. See that's hard to say because some people like their spending habits are different
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:49.500]  Yeah, like where you choose to put your money I could understand that I'm this is a weird rant
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:54.180]  But my mom will say everything is expensive. How much is it? It's two pennies. I'm so expensive
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:57.220]  I'm like isn't that she's from back in the day when that was a quarter of a penny
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.900]  So now it's a fucking she just sees it. Oh my god
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:03.760]  So yeah, it's just so it's gonna hear but for me that was well worth 11 bucks
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.480]  Is my fucking really short answer of a lot of long words?
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.260]  I'm just saying usually things on that love
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.240]  Are a lot more if you will an edible
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:13.360]  Yeah
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:17.600]  An edible is 10 to 15 bucks maybe 20 bucks or something really potent if you're going to a concert or something and you want
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.360]  To get fucking high as fuck and not have to worry about smoking through it because that's why I like edibles
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.240]  I go to a comedy show and you can't smoke at the comedy works
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:28.200]  They will throw you the fuck out and you're highly visible in there. That place is tiny
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:32.160]  Yeah, so eat a fat edible and just sit in there and grin like a tard the whole night
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.460]  Yeah, fucking this would be beautiful for that someone likes to say pregame
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.200]  eat it about a
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.160]  fucking
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.320]  North end of Denver if you're driving up from Pueblo if I can eat that fucker stop and get gas at that one gas station
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.320]  There you go
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.680]  One big ass or whatever eat that fucker in the parking lot and then get back on the road and by the time you get to
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.360]  Comedy works, you'll have a smile on your face. Mmm
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.040]  You're going in Denver, you know, that's just my arm
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.460]  But this was yeah, it was worth 11 bucks
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:01.940]  So if you're going I was gonna go at least I want to go up there and get some weed
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:09.860]  And you know what that $11 included tax right there dispensary includes tax. So 11 bucks flat out the door. That is great
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:13.580]  If you're
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:18.700]  Like fucking vegan or something. I don't know what their option is for you because that's super chocolatey
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.780]  And if you're diabetic, you're gonna have to be careful with that
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:25.980]  But of course, you're not supposed to eat seven doses all at once like I did that's got me rambling
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:32.300]  Everything in moderation, I guess go big or go home on the agriculture podcast. That's right
