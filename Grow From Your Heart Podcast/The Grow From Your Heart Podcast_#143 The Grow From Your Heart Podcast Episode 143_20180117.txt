[00:17.600 --> 00:22.140]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community. It's time for episode number 143 of the Grow From
[00:22.140 --> 00:25.920]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:25.920 --> 00:29.840]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:29.840 --> 00:33.840]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.840 --> 00:38.840]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:38.840 --> 00:42.400]  host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As
[00:42.400 --> 00:45.920]  always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:45.920 --> 00:50.400]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Coop, and the entire
[00:50.400 --> 00:57.200]  Mystic Roots crew. I hope everybody had a great 7-10. I hope everybody enjoyed the Sunday
[00:57.200 --> 01:02.040]  episode. You guys, on this episode, I am joined by Jesse Grose from the Colorado podcast.
[01:02.040 --> 01:06.760]  We talk a whole bunch about outdoor growing. We talk a whole bunch of random stuff. The
[01:06.760 --> 01:10.960]  episode was an hour and 20 minutes long, so I'm not going to waste too much time here
[01:10.960 --> 01:13.720]  at the start of the show. I'm going to let the music play, and in just a second, I'll
[01:13.720 --> 01:22.200]  be right back with Jesse Grose. Hang out with us. Wait, say that again. Is that a real
[01:22.200 --> 01:23.200]  thing? Gunpowder turps?
[01:23.200 --> 01:24.200]  Gunpowder turps.
[01:24.200 --> 01:25.200]  What does that mean?
[01:25.200 --> 01:28.680]  Government mule smells like burnt fireworks.
[01:28.680 --> 01:33.440]  That's what you meant by that. I was confused by that statement. I was like, gunpowder turps?
[01:33.440 --> 01:37.480]  I'm missing out on some shit. What's happening now? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to
[01:37.480 --> 01:40.760]  the podcast. I said I'd be right back with our friend Jesse, and guess what? There he
[01:40.760 --> 01:42.400]  is. Welcome to the show, brother.
[01:42.400 --> 01:43.400]  Thank you.
[01:43.400 --> 01:46.680]  Let's tell everybody about your social media so that they can stalk you while they're listening.
[01:46.680 --> 01:48.680]  Where can they find you online?
[01:48.680 --> 01:53.280]  Instagram, jessegrose, at jessegrose, whatever.
[01:53.280 --> 01:54.280]  At jessegrose on Instagram.
[01:54.280 --> 01:58.560]  I post a couple pics a week there.
[01:58.560 --> 01:59.560]  Glorious cannabis photography.
[01:59.560 --> 02:04.120]  For the most part, or just crap I find interesting.
[02:04.120 --> 02:05.720]  I think those are very similar things.
[02:05.720 --> 02:06.720]  Yeah.
[02:06.720 --> 02:09.720]  Do you have a website?
[02:10.040 --> 02:18.520]  I do Colorado Podcast. We are now on Stitcher. We're also on SoundCloud. We're also on our
[02:18.520 --> 02:20.520]  own website at coloradopodcast.com.
[02:20.520 --> 02:26.520]  Make sure you guys support the Colorado Podcast and my friends Jesse on Despicable D and our
[02:26.520 --> 02:29.520]  boy 44. Shout out to all those guys.
[02:29.520 --> 02:32.520]  It's a podcast.
[02:32.520 --> 02:35.520]  It's very podcast-y.
[02:36.320 --> 02:43.320]  It's loosely cannabis-based. We get around to talking about weed every now and then.
[02:43.320 --> 02:46.320]  Wacky and wild adventures for the most part.
[02:46.320 --> 02:49.320]  Yes. It's the mullet of podcasting.
[02:49.320 --> 02:52.320]  Oh, I'm so using that.
[02:52.320 --> 02:57.320]  If your podcast had a haircut, it would certainly have a mullet. Your mic may jump out of that
[02:57.320 --> 02:58.320]  little clip if you have it like that.
[02:58.320 --> 02:59.320]  You're cool. There you go.
[02:59.320 --> 03:00.320]  That's a good adjustment.
[03:00.320 --> 03:01.320]  Cool.
[03:01.320 --> 03:02.320]  Cool.
[03:02.320 --> 03:03.320]  Welcome to the show, bro. Thanks for joining us.
[03:03.320 --> 03:04.320]  Make sure you guys support his podcast, you guys.
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.120]  Jesse is kind of an outdoor grow expert. He's been on the show several times if you've listened.
[03:09.120 --> 03:13.120]  He knows a lot about outdoor growing. I know a lot about indoor growing.
[03:13.120 --> 03:16.120]  We had some outdoor questions.
[03:16.120 --> 03:22.120]  Jesse wants to talk a little bit about the differences in small basement cultivation
[03:22.120 --> 03:26.120]  compared to large commercial grow. We'll get into that also.
[03:26.120 --> 03:29.120]  Let's talk about an email that I got.
[03:29.120 --> 03:32.120]  I got an email from a listener. I don't have the email on my phone right now.
[03:32.920 --> 03:34.920]  Shout out to the guy that sent me an email.
[03:34.920 --> 03:40.920]  He asked, when he's growing outdoors, how big of a hole does he want to dig to put his plant in?
[03:40.920 --> 03:44.920]  I told him through an email, I told him to listen to the show and I'd have Jesse on for more info.
[03:44.920 --> 03:47.920]  I told him basically, make the hole as big as you can.
[03:47.920 --> 03:50.920]  What else can you tell us about that, Jesse?
[03:50.920 --> 03:57.920]  I personally, over the years, I've noticed a plant's somewhat limited,
[03:57.920 --> 04:00.920]  especially when it's in the ground, by the size of its container.
[04:01.720 --> 04:08.720]  The ground's a huge container, but if your hole has a pre-mixed soil in it,
[04:08.720 --> 04:13.720]  the shoulders of the plant aren't going to go too far past the edge of that hole.
[04:13.720 --> 04:20.720]  I started off with 2x2 holes and worked up to 3x3 holes, and now I do 4x4 holes.
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.720]  It'll probably keep going someday, 5x5 holes.
[04:25.720 --> 04:29.720]  When you're doing these 4x4 holes, you're doing a 4x4 square, right?
[04:30.520 --> 04:33.520]  4 feet wide, 4 feet long. How deep are you going?
[04:33.520 --> 04:40.520]  18 inches. I used to go deeper. I've learned a little bit more about the root system of cannabis.
[04:40.520 --> 04:45.520]  Am I right in thinking that cannabis wants to root outward instead of downward?
[04:45.520 --> 04:50.520]  For the most part, yeah. It does like to go down, especially if you're going from seed plants,
[04:50.520 --> 04:55.520]  you get the taproot in there, which can have extraordinary links, actually.
[04:56.320 --> 05:03.320]  But for the most part, clones, they're going to reach out to the sides and steady down.
[05:03.320 --> 05:13.320]  A note on that, a 3x3x3 foot hole that's 18 inches deep is 99 gallons of dirt.
[05:13.320 --> 05:17.320]  That is a lot of damn dirt. Do you know how many cubic feet that is?
[05:17.320 --> 05:22.320]  Well, we'd have to do the math on the size of the hole that you just said.
[05:23.120 --> 05:26.120]  5 cubic feet, maybe I want to say 6.
[05:26.120 --> 05:31.120]  It's got to be more than that because one of those Fox Farm bags is 1.75 cubic feet.
[05:31.120 --> 05:33.120]  How many of those bags do you think it would take?
[05:33.120 --> 05:38.120]  I was thinking 3.8 cubic feet.
[05:38.120 --> 05:42.120]  This is how growers think in math, you guys.
[05:42.120 --> 05:47.120]  That's probably close to 10 cubic feet. I think it would take 3 chromic spells to fill it up.
[05:47.120 --> 05:49.120]  That's a lot of soil. That's a lot of root space.
[05:49.920 --> 05:53.920]  How big are these plants? In your example, how big are your plants at the end of the season?
[05:53.920 --> 06:00.920]  Four or five foot around. All the way around. Not just through one spot.
[06:02.920 --> 06:05.920]  So you can't hug your plants? You can't get your arms around them to hug them?
[06:05.920 --> 06:06.920]  No. Hell no.
[06:09.920 --> 06:12.920]  I kind of limit my plants. They can only get about 6 foot tall.
[06:13.720 --> 06:19.720]  If I was able to let them get bigger, they'd probably end up 8 or 9 foot tall.
[06:20.720 --> 06:22.720]  You limit it by privacy? Yes.
[06:22.720 --> 06:23.720]  That's such a bitch.
[06:23.720 --> 06:24.720]  Yes.
[06:24.720 --> 06:27.720]  You do such a great outdoor grow to limit you as a bitch.
[06:27.720 --> 06:32.720]  I used to fight it real hard to keep them down. I have learned a new trick. Just plant later.
[06:32.720 --> 06:34.720]  Plant later, huh? Is that the new trick?
[06:34.720 --> 06:35.720]  Yeah.
[06:35.720 --> 06:36.720]  Super high tech?
[06:36.720 --> 06:37.720]  Yeah.
[06:37.720 --> 06:40.720]  You don't have to bend them as much? You don't have to top as much? Just take them out later in the season?
[06:40.720 --> 06:41.720]  Hashtag lazy tech.
[06:42.520 --> 06:43.520]  Lazy tech. Wook tech.
[06:45.520 --> 06:49.520]  Are we in the flowering phase officially yet or do we still have a few days to go?
[06:49.520 --> 06:53.520]  I feel like we've still got a week or so to go.
[06:53.520 --> 06:58.520]  So in about a week here in Colorado, and we were doing research before the show, from coast to coast,
[06:58.520 --> 07:03.520]  there's only about a half hour in sunlight photo period, in natural photo period right now.
[07:03.520 --> 07:06.520]  We were talking about it. Jesse was doing the research.
[07:07.320 --> 07:15.320]  The difference between what I was finding, it was like New York, the sun was coming up at 539 in the morning.
[07:15.320 --> 07:19.320]  And in Los Angeles, it was coming up at like 608 or some shit.
[07:19.320 --> 07:22.320]  So that's odd.
[07:24.320 --> 07:34.320]  But yeah, so photo period, it's going to start really shrinking from here on out.
[07:35.120 --> 07:41.120]  First you're going to get your Indica varieties into flower, and then your more sativa varieties will follow along behind that.
[07:41.120 --> 07:46.120]  Yeah, your flow and blueberry, those are really going to start taking off right in the next week or so.
[07:46.120 --> 07:51.120]  Everyone in Colorado that grows flow, that bitch is going to go into flower real hard here in about a week, ten days.
[07:51.120 --> 07:56.120]  She'll be spitting out calyxes real soon for you. You'll love it. You'll see pistils in like 20 days, I bet.
[07:56.120 --> 07:57.120]  Yeah, oh yeah, easy.
[07:57.120 --> 08:01.120]  Alright, plant later. Such a ridiculous solution for easy shit.
[08:01.920 --> 08:07.920]  It's been my goal lately, it's just K-I-S-S, keep it simple.
[08:07.920 --> 08:08.920]  Keep it simple stoner.
[08:08.920 --> 08:09.920]  Yeah.
[08:09.920 --> 08:13.920]  So the size of your plant, sorry I keep clearing the throat guys, we're taking some dabs.
[08:13.920 --> 08:15.920]  Let's talk about these dabs for a brief second.
[08:15.920 --> 08:24.920]  I was dunking my dabber into 90% THC, this is 91% THC, it's a distillate from our friends at EvoLab.
[08:25.720 --> 08:34.720]  And then I take the 90% distillate that's on my dabber and I dunk that into pure terpenoids of ghost-trained haze, also made by our friends at EvoLabs.
[08:34.720 --> 08:38.720]  This is amazing you guys, this is one of the best highs you can get.
[08:38.720 --> 08:41.720]  The first couple of times I smoked this I got stupid high.
[08:41.720 --> 08:43.720]  I was just goofy.
[08:43.720 --> 08:47.720]  I tried to go back to work and I pretty much just ended up doing stuff on the computer for the next hour.
[08:47.720 --> 08:50.720]  Because, it's like yeah, metric needs to be updated somehow.
[08:50.720 --> 08:53.720]  Because I got to sit down in a chair for a minute.
[08:54.520 --> 08:58.520]  But shoutouts to the dabs, that's why my throat's a little bit clogged, I do apologize for being so congested today.
[08:58.520 --> 09:01.520]  Yeah, those OG Kush dabs were heavenly.
[09:01.520 --> 09:03.520]  Yeah, that's delicious isn't it though?
[09:03.520 --> 09:07.520]  I've got ghost-trained haze terps and OG Kush terps.
[09:07.520 --> 09:14.520]  And then a couple nights ago I took some of this 120 micron blue sherb, fresh frozen solventless hash,
[09:14.520 --> 09:19.520]  and I rolled out a little piece into a taco shell and I put some, what did I have?
[09:19.520 --> 09:22.520]  It was cactus cooler live resin on top of that.
[09:23.320 --> 09:29.320]  And then I took a piece of Durban poison shatter and rolled it into a little snake and put that in the middle like some taco meat.
[09:29.320 --> 09:36.320]  And then I put, I dunked the dabber into the 90% THC distillate and had that on the dabber.
[09:36.320 --> 09:41.320]  And then I picked up the taco with the dabber and dunked that into the ghost-trained haze terps.
[09:41.320 --> 09:45.320]  And I was blast off high.
[09:45.320 --> 09:47.320]  I was rocket high.
[09:47.320 --> 09:50.320]  Yeah, you should have put a little THC in there somewhere.
[09:51.120 --> 09:53.120]  My arm hair was wiggling.
[09:53.120 --> 09:56.120]  I was like, woo! I was making funny faces and funny noises.
[09:56.120 --> 09:58.120]  I was really high for a little while.
[09:58.120 --> 10:06.120]  My first terp dab, my arms and legs went very pleasantly numb.
[10:06.120 --> 10:08.120]  Like almost immediately.
[10:08.120 --> 10:10.120]  Yeah, there's something about smoking just raw terps.
[10:10.120 --> 10:15.120]  Yeah, I immediately, I was like, damn, this is medicine.
[10:15.920 --> 10:22.920]  For someone somewhere, for me it's great recreation, but for someone somewhere, that's something.
[10:22.920 --> 10:24.920]  I like to take just the normal shatter I've got.
[10:24.920 --> 10:29.920]  I've got this Durban poison Mob Boss shatter and I just take little chunks of that and dunk that into the OG Kush dabs.
[10:29.920 --> 10:31.920]  And it makes it taste so amazing.
[10:31.920 --> 10:33.920]  Mob Boss, that's one I haven't heard of in a while.
[10:33.920 --> 10:34.920]  Yeah, right, it's been a while.
[10:34.920 --> 10:38.920]  When this is gone, I don't know if I'm going to be able to properly get high anymore
[10:38.920 --> 10:44.920]  because I've been smoking this distillate and these terps so heavily that my tolerance game has upped itself.
[10:45.720 --> 10:47.720]  I go smoke with other people, they're just like, dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[10:47.720 --> 10:49.720]  And I'm like, don't you want more dabs?
[10:49.720 --> 10:51.720]  And they're in the corner in a coma.
[10:51.720 --> 10:53.720]  I'm like, come on, let's party.
[10:53.720 --> 10:55.720]  One more quick question on that.
[10:55.720 --> 11:00.720]  Do you think the terps, I mean, I think I already know the answer to this,
[11:00.720 --> 11:06.720]  but I'll just ask, do the terps complete, if you dip it in just like a normal shatter,
[11:06.720 --> 11:11.720]  do the terps complete something there or make it more powerful in your opinion?
[11:11.720 --> 11:14.720]  It pushes it, yeah, it pushes the high a little bit higher.
[11:15.520 --> 11:16.520]  It certainly pushes the high up.
[11:16.520 --> 11:20.520]  I think my theory, it's probably not such a theory,
[11:20.520 --> 11:28.520]  but the terpenoids work along with the cannabinoids just like the entourage effect that we talked with.
[11:28.520 --> 11:32.520]  Absolutely, because the terpenoids that we're using, guys,
[11:32.520 --> 11:35.520]  it looks like pee.
[11:35.520 --> 11:38.520]  It's just little drops of gold in a vial.
[11:39.320 --> 11:45.320]  It's got the consistency of like a really high grade, like a machine oil or something like that.
[11:45.320 --> 11:49.320]  Yeah, I was going to say really runny olive oil, a little runnier than olive oil maybe.
[11:49.320 --> 11:52.320]  And you just dunk the dab right into it is what I've been doing.
[11:52.320 --> 11:55.320]  I've been putting a dab on the dabber and just dunk it.
[11:55.320 --> 11:57.320]  And I dunked it too hard one time.
[11:57.320 --> 11:59.320]  I just dunked it in there and gave it a little swizzle.
[11:59.320 --> 12:04.320]  And when it hit the nail, I heard the terps go pfft, they like sizzled.
[12:05.120 --> 12:10.120]  I had terp face, like my mouth just tasted like ghost train haze forever.
[12:10.120 --> 12:11.120]  But it was almost unpleasant.
[12:11.120 --> 12:15.120]  It was like I OD'd my face on terps, but then I was rocket high.
[12:15.120 --> 12:16.120]  That's something else.
[12:16.120 --> 12:21.120]  It kind of, you can almost wash away the flavor with too much.
[12:21.120 --> 12:24.120]  It's so overwhelming you don't even get anything.
[12:24.120 --> 12:26.120]  You just burn, yeah, you maximum overload your mouth.
[12:26.120 --> 12:29.120]  And it's like I can't taste anything because you just ruined my palate.
[12:29.120 --> 12:34.120]  It's like when you eat something too spicy for the next hour, everything just tastes spicy.
[12:34.920 --> 12:36.920]  To our friend that sent us an email about digging holes,
[12:36.920 --> 12:38.920]  the bigger the hole, the bigger the plant.
[12:38.920 --> 12:43.920]  Jesse recommends about a 3x3, 4x4, about 18 inches deep.
[12:43.920 --> 12:45.920]  Fill it with the best soil that you can afford.
[12:45.920 --> 12:46.920]  Put some amendments in there.
[12:46.920 --> 12:49.920]  Let's give them a list of five good amendments to throw in there.
[12:49.920 --> 12:57.920]  Worm castings, oyster shell, alfalfa, kelp meal, neem seed meal, and caranja seed meal.
[12:57.920 --> 12:58.920]  That's six.
[12:58.920 --> 13:03.920]  I'm going to throw in crab shell or oyster or shrimp shell mill in there too.
[13:04.720 --> 13:05.720]  Pretty much set there.
[13:05.720 --> 13:06.720]  There we go, you guys.
[13:06.720 --> 13:07.720]  I hope you wrote that down.
[13:07.720 --> 13:10.720]  If not, hit that little 15 second back button twice and you'll get it again.
[13:10.720 --> 13:11.720]  Write it down.
[13:11.720 --> 13:13.720]  Put that stuff in that big hole with your soil.
[13:13.720 --> 13:15.720]  Maybe put some perlite in there.
[13:15.720 --> 13:17.720]  Yeah, or rice holes.
[13:21.720 --> 13:22.720]  Yeah.
[13:22.720 --> 13:23.720]  All right, that's soil.
[13:23.720 --> 13:24.720]  Pumice, there you go, pumice.
[13:24.720 --> 13:25.720]  There you go.
[13:25.720 --> 13:26.720]  Lava rock.
[13:26.720 --> 13:27.720]  Lava rock, yeah.
[13:27.720 --> 13:28.720]  Some sort of drainage.
[13:28.720 --> 13:29.720]  You want to get some oxygen in there,
[13:29.720 --> 13:32.720]  but you don't want to take up too much root space with a bunch of rock and perlite.
[13:33.520 --> 13:34.520]  So figure out your mix.
[13:34.520 --> 13:39.520]  Outdoor soil doesn't need to be as airy as indoor soil, especially in the ground.
[13:39.520 --> 13:47.520]  So you can do yourself a great disservice by putting too much perlite in there.
[13:47.520 --> 13:51.520]  It's just going to increase the frequency of happening to water.
[13:51.520 --> 13:52.520]  Okay.
[13:52.520 --> 13:55.520]  See, that's why you're the outdoor pro and I'm the indoor guy.
[13:55.520 --> 13:56.520]  All right.
[13:56.520 --> 13:58.520]  Big shout out to my friend that sent me the email.
[13:58.520 --> 13:59.520]  Keep the emails coming.
[13:59.520 --> 14:01.520]  If you have any more follow-up questions, let me know.
[14:02.320 --> 14:03.320]  We'll get them on the show for you.
[14:03.320 --> 14:04.320]  And mulch that soil up.
[14:04.320 --> 14:05.320]  Keep it mulched.
[14:05.320 --> 14:06.320]  There you go.
[14:06.320 --> 14:09.320]  It makes a huge, huge difference at the end of the season.
[14:09.320 --> 14:12.320]  It's totally, totally worth it.
[14:12.320 --> 14:14.320]  We're going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff for outdoor season.
[14:14.320 --> 14:15.320]  I've got questions this year.
[14:15.320 --> 14:16.320]  Nice, nice.
[14:16.320 --> 14:17.320]  All right.
[14:17.320 --> 14:18.320]  So our friend Fred, Fred Garvin.
[14:18.320 --> 14:19.320]  Hey, Fred.
[14:19.320 --> 14:20.320]  He keeps the messages coming.
[14:20.320 --> 14:23.320]  Fred listens to the Colorado Dope podcast.
[14:23.320 --> 14:24.320]  Nice.
[14:24.320 --> 14:25.320]  Shut up.
[14:25.320 --> 14:26.320]  That's cool.
[14:26.320 --> 14:27.320]  He listens to both of our shows.
[14:27.320 --> 14:28.320]  We're going to have to do more of the swap casts.
[14:28.320 --> 14:29.320]  Hell yeah.
[14:29.320 --> 14:30.320]  Yeah, those are fun.
[14:30.320 --> 14:31.320]  We'll duct tape Adam next time.
[14:32.120 --> 14:33.120]  I love you, bro.
[14:33.120 --> 14:34.120]  I also love picking on you.
[14:34.120 --> 14:35.120]  Hope you're doing well.
[14:35.120 --> 14:36.120]  So Fred sent us a message a while back.
[14:36.120 --> 14:38.120]  He was making seeded plants.
[14:38.120 --> 14:39.120]  He had pollen.
[14:39.120 --> 14:41.120]  He put pollen on female plants.
[14:41.120 --> 14:42.120]  Those plants have now been pollinated.
[14:42.120 --> 14:43.120]  They're forming seeds.
[14:43.120 --> 14:44.120]  He put them outdoors.
[14:44.120 --> 14:52.120]  He had many questions about putting them outdoors, about acclimating them to the outdoor area
[14:52.120 --> 14:54.120]  and how to get the timer right.
[14:54.120 --> 14:58.120]  Once I messaged Jesse about this, Jesse had a great idea.
[14:58.920 --> 15:03.920]  Jesse said that once those plants are pollinated, if you go put them outside and the light cycle
[15:03.920 --> 15:07.920]  is a little bit off, they're not going to harm because they're already pollinated.
[15:07.920 --> 15:09.920]  They've pretty much passed their...
[15:09.920 --> 15:14.920]  I guess if they were humans, now they would be in menopause if they were females.
[15:14.920 --> 15:16.920]  They're past that cycle.
[15:16.920 --> 15:18.920]  Their whole sexual reproductive thing is done.
[15:18.920 --> 15:20.920]  They've already decided they're making seeds.
[15:20.920 --> 15:23.920]  They have a manifest destiny to complete.
[15:23.920 --> 15:24.920]  Yes.
[15:24.920 --> 15:27.920]  And if a girl's pregnant, you can't already get her pregnant.
[15:28.720 --> 15:32.720]  Those plants that we told Fred to put outside should be 100% legit.
[15:32.720 --> 15:36.720]  He also mentioned in one of his emails that his outdoor plants were in full flower.
[15:36.720 --> 15:38.720]  He's totally going to be okay.
[15:38.720 --> 15:39.720]  Totally fine there.
[15:39.720 --> 15:41.720]  Shout out to Fred for sending me messages.
[15:41.720 --> 15:42.720]  Dude, I appreciate it.
[15:42.720 --> 15:45.720]  I hope you've got at least an iRegenetic sticker or something.
[15:45.720 --> 15:46.720]  Send me a message.
[15:46.720 --> 15:48.720]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com.
[15:48.720 --> 15:51.720]  Tell me that it's you because I know that that's not your real name, bro.
[15:51.720 --> 15:52.720]  Come on.
[15:52.720 --> 15:53.720]  I know better than that.
[15:53.720 --> 15:54.720]  Send me an email.
[15:54.720 --> 15:55.720]  We'll get you some more stickers or something if you want it.
[15:55.720 --> 15:57.720]  We love all of your input.
[15:58.520 --> 16:00.520]  I have a friend on Facebook.
[16:00.520 --> 16:01.520]  I'm going to have to clear that one out.
[16:01.520 --> 16:03.520]  I'm going to have to edit that throat clear out.
[16:03.520 --> 16:04.520]  That was ridiculous.
[16:04.520 --> 16:11.520]  I got a friend on Facebook that her or his name, I'm pretty sure it's a her though,
[16:11.520 --> 16:16.520]  is the last name, first and last name is the last name of a movie star.
[16:16.520 --> 16:20.520]  And I called her out on it one time in a private message.
[16:20.520 --> 16:22.520]  I was like, I know your name's fake.
[16:22.520 --> 16:23.520]  How did you figure that out?
[16:23.520 --> 16:25.520]  And I was like, well, duh.
[16:26.320 --> 16:28.320]  I was like, so and so, so and so, and so and so, so.
[16:28.320 --> 16:30.320]  Oh, wow, you're clever.
[16:30.320 --> 16:31.320]  I'm like, no, I'm not.
[16:31.320 --> 16:35.320]  You're just slipping on your secret tech.
[16:35.320 --> 16:37.320]  Nobody is who they say they are on Facebook.
[16:37.320 --> 16:38.320]  No.
[16:38.320 --> 16:39.320]  But I use my real name.
[16:39.320 --> 16:40.320]  I like it.
[16:40.320 --> 16:41.320]  I like it.
[16:41.320 --> 16:42.320]  Then you think about what you're posting.
[16:42.320 --> 16:44.320]  You can't spend time trolling people if you got your name and face up there.
[16:44.320 --> 16:45.320]  Yep.
[16:45.320 --> 16:46.320]  All right.
[16:46.320 --> 16:47.320]  So Fred put his plants outdoors.
[16:47.320 --> 16:49.320]  They're not going to hermaphrodite on him.
[16:49.320 --> 16:50.320]  I do not believe so.
[16:50.320 --> 16:53.320]  He's going to have viable seeds if he waits long enough.
[16:53.320 --> 16:54.320]  Yep.
[16:55.120 --> 16:57.120]  He actually pulled some of those seeds, I think.
[16:57.120 --> 16:58.120]  I think he's got some of those seeds.
[16:58.120 --> 17:02.120]  A lot of them were white, but plenty of them were viable in tiger stripes.
[17:02.120 --> 17:03.120]  So good work, bro.
[17:03.120 --> 17:04.120]  Do you know what the cross was?
[17:04.120 --> 17:05.120]  I can't.
[17:05.120 --> 17:06.120]  I really don't remember.
[17:06.120 --> 17:07.120]  I don't remember, honestly.
[17:07.120 --> 17:11.120]  I read so many emails and read so many crosses that a lot of that shit.
[17:11.120 --> 17:14.120]  I've got a lot of the crosses in the Green and Healthy Wellness Garden.
[17:14.120 --> 17:16.120]  I can't remember what they are off the top of my head.
[17:16.120 --> 17:17.120]  I'm the same way.
[17:17.120 --> 17:18.120]  Yeah, I learned a few.
[17:18.120 --> 17:19.120]  You know what I mean?
[17:19.120 --> 17:20.120]  As I go, I'm like, that one's this one.
[17:20.120 --> 17:21.120]  I remember that now.
[17:21.120 --> 17:23.120]  And I just absorb those slowly.
[17:23.920 --> 17:25.920]  Alright, so he's got his plants outdoors.
[17:25.920 --> 17:26.920]  They've got seeds in them.
[17:26.920 --> 17:29.920]  And since then, his shit got attacked by spider mites.
[17:29.920 --> 17:30.920]  Oh no.
[17:30.920 --> 17:33.920]  And he asked, I don't have his email in front of me, but basically he said,
[17:33.920 --> 17:36.920]  none of this plant material is going to be consumed or smoked by people
[17:36.920 --> 17:38.920]  since it's all just seeded.
[17:38.920 --> 17:42.920]  How nuclear can I go to spray the fuck out of it for these spider mites?
[17:46.920 --> 17:50.920]  My opinion would be as nuclear as he is comfortable with.
[17:50.920 --> 17:51.920]  That's what I told him.
[17:52.720 --> 17:53.720]  I don't think it will affect the seed.
[17:53.720 --> 17:56.720]  I told him keep in mind his health while he's applying pesticides
[17:56.720 --> 17:58.720]  and keep in mind the health of the rest of his garden.
[17:58.720 --> 18:00.720]  Because I know he's got other cannabis plants out there.
[18:00.720 --> 18:02.720]  And the insects in that garden.
[18:02.720 --> 18:03.720]  Absolutely.
[18:03.720 --> 18:04.720]  And the soil.
[18:04.720 --> 18:05.720]  The normal biodiversity of that area.
[18:05.720 --> 18:07.720]  Yeah, be aware of that.
[18:07.720 --> 18:08.720]  Bees.
[18:08.720 --> 18:09.720]  Oh, don't kill the bees.
[18:09.720 --> 18:10.720]  That's super important.
[18:10.720 --> 18:12.720]  If the bees go away, everything goes away.
[18:12.720 --> 18:14.720]  We don't have food if we don't have bees.
[18:14.720 --> 18:17.720]  I saw my dad's neighbor spraying Roundup in his yard the other day.
[18:17.720 --> 18:18.720]  I went and chased that fucker down.
[18:18.720 --> 18:20.720]  I was like, no.
[18:21.520 --> 18:23.520]  I was like, see those three white boxes over there?
[18:23.520 --> 18:26.520]  And instantly he was like, oh man, I'm so sorry.
[18:26.520 --> 18:29.520]  We got him set up with some Epsom salt and vinegar.
[18:29.520 --> 18:30.520]  There you go.
[18:30.520 --> 18:31.520]  Go organic.
[18:31.520 --> 18:32.520]  Yeah.
[18:32.520 --> 18:34.520]  That'll get rid of almost any insect that you don't want around.
[18:34.520 --> 18:35.520]  Yeah.
[18:35.520 --> 18:38.520]  Several tablespoons of Epsom salt per gallon.
[18:38.520 --> 18:44.520]  Can I ask you about how to get rid of fucking grasshoppers right now in a ganja garden outdoors?
[18:44.520 --> 18:47.520]  Yeah, that is a very popular question lately.
[18:47.520 --> 18:49.520]  Yeah, they're super heavy everywhere this year.
[18:50.320 --> 18:53.320]  My wife, Bernadette.
[18:53.320 --> 18:54.320]  My wife.
[18:54.320 --> 18:55.320]  My wife.
[18:55.320 --> 18:56.320]  My beautiful wife.
[18:56.320 --> 18:59.320]  She has a list of pesticides.
[18:59.320 --> 19:02.320]  I cannot require or recall any of them.
[19:02.320 --> 19:10.320]  And none of them, knowing the way they work and how grasshoppers work, I felt really were necessary.
[19:10.320 --> 19:15.320]  I didn't feel like you may kill one or two grasshoppers with it or you may discourage one or two.
[19:16.120 --> 19:21.120]  So my big thing, mow the weeds around your area.
[19:21.120 --> 19:23.120]  That's one of the biggest ones.
[19:23.120 --> 19:25.120]  Take away their food supply.
[19:25.120 --> 19:31.120]  Molasses traps, which is a mason jar that is a quarter of the way filled with water,
[19:31.120 --> 19:38.120]  a quarter of the way filled with molasses, buried to the rim around the plants.
[19:38.120 --> 19:42.120]  I know it's kind of archaic, you know, really simple here.
[19:42.120 --> 19:43.120]  It's building a moat.
[19:43.920 --> 19:45.920]  But yeah, they fall in it and they can't get out.
[19:45.920 --> 19:47.920]  Alright, that makes total sense.
[19:47.920 --> 19:51.920]  Try to attract blue jays and robins to your grow area.
[19:51.920 --> 19:54.920]  Robins, I don't know how to attract.
[19:54.920 --> 19:56.920]  Blue jays, I know really like peanuts.
[19:56.920 --> 19:57.920]  Hey, there you go.
[19:57.920 --> 20:00.920]  What else is going to show up if we throw out peanuts?
[20:00.920 --> 20:03.920]  Is that going to bring rabbits?
[20:03.920 --> 20:05.920]  I suppose so, possibly.
[20:05.920 --> 20:06.920]  Okay.
[20:06.920 --> 20:10.920]  See, my first idea, I told my friend to put a chicken in his yard to get rid of his grasshoppers.
[20:10.920 --> 20:12.920]  Is that going to bring me more problems?
[20:13.720 --> 20:16.720]  In the beginning stages, chickens love grasshoppers.
[20:16.720 --> 20:18.720]  They also love juvenile marijuana plants.
[20:18.720 --> 20:19.720]  Okay.
[20:19.720 --> 20:24.720]  Once you've got a four or five foot tall bush, the chicken is going to use it as shade.
[20:24.720 --> 20:27.720]  And it really isn't going to notice it too much.
[20:27.720 --> 20:29.720]  It might peck at the understory a little bit.
[20:29.720 --> 20:31.720]  Okay, it might clean it up for you.
[20:31.720 --> 20:33.720]  It might do some lollipopping.
[20:35.720 --> 20:37.720]  Hey, Pedro, time to go to work, buddy.
[20:37.720 --> 20:39.720]  Chickens don't have to have badges.
[20:40.520 --> 20:42.520]  Oh, shit.
[20:42.520 --> 20:43.520]  Oh, shit.
[20:43.520 --> 20:47.520]  Got a whole bunch of undocumented chickens running this fucking conju farm.
[20:47.520 --> 20:51.520]  They're fucking doing pest management and lollipopping plants for us.
[20:51.520 --> 20:52.520]  We're geniuses over here.
[20:52.520 --> 20:54.520]  Let's train some chickens, bro.
[20:54.520 --> 20:56.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:56.520 --> 20:58.520]  Four cocks, tree service.
[21:02.520 --> 21:04.520]  Sorry, guys, this got weird.
[21:04.520 --> 21:05.520]  Blame it on the Terps.
[21:05.520 --> 21:07.520]  Hashtag blame it on the Terps.
[21:07.520 --> 21:08.520]  There we go.
[21:08.520 --> 21:09.520]  There we go.
[21:09.520 --> 21:10.520]  Yeah, shout out to the Terps.
[21:10.520 --> 21:13.520]  One other comment on grasshoppers.
[21:13.520 --> 21:16.520]  I'm hippy-dippy when it comes to growing outdoors.
[21:16.520 --> 21:22.520]  As soon as I hear about a grasshopper problem, I feel like something's out of balance.
[21:22.520 --> 21:27.520]  So instead of killing the grasshopper, you might want to look at the bigger picture.
[21:27.520 --> 21:29.520]  That's always the case.
[21:29.520 --> 21:33.520]  And see if something's missing there or if you're doing something wrong.
[21:33.520 --> 21:36.520]  I'm going to say that's like 75% of the time that is the case.
[21:36.520 --> 21:37.520]  For sure.
[21:37.520 --> 21:39.520]  Really, I feel like this applies to smaller grows.
[21:39.520 --> 21:43.520]  Like those guys out on Siloam Road where they've got four acres planted in the ground.
[21:43.520 --> 21:47.520]  I mean, that's a completely different scenario.
[21:47.520 --> 21:50.520]  They're going to have those issues regardless.
[21:50.520 --> 21:52.520]  That is a lot of damn cannabis.
[21:52.520 --> 21:54.520]  Yeah, I went out and drove and looked at it today, dude.
[21:54.520 --> 21:56.520]  It's fucking huge.
[21:56.520 --> 21:58.520]  Siloam Road, near Beulah?
[21:58.520 --> 21:59.520]  Yeah.
[21:59.520 --> 22:00.520]  Okay.
[22:00.520 --> 22:01.520]  I'm going to take a drive out there.
[22:01.520 --> 22:02.520]  It's called the Green Mile for a reason.
[22:02.520 --> 22:03.520]  Oh, yeah.
[22:03.520 --> 22:04.520]  They're doing huge things.
[22:04.520 --> 22:13.520]  Everyone talks shit about Pueblo, Colorado, but everywhere around us is greenhouses and outdoor grows and just acres and acres of hemp and acres and acres of cannabis.
[22:13.520 --> 22:14.520]  It's just everywhere.
[22:14.520 --> 22:15.520]  It's so rad right now.
[22:15.520 --> 22:18.520]  Drive out there, 50 and 96.
[22:18.520 --> 22:19.520]  We need more.
[22:19.520 --> 22:20.520]  The place is huge, too.
[22:20.520 --> 22:22.520]  More.
[22:22.520 --> 22:24.520]  I don't know that there's a technical term for these restaurants.
[22:24.520 --> 22:26.520]  Fast casual, I think.
[22:26.520 --> 22:27.520]  More fast casual restaurants.
[22:27.520 --> 22:28.520]  Nice.
[22:28.520 --> 22:31.520]  Because that's what the grow industry and people like us, that's what we crave.
[22:31.520 --> 22:33.520]  We don't want the Taco Bell, the Dr. Pepper.
[22:33.520 --> 22:34.520]  I saw a lead go in here earlier.
[22:34.520 --> 22:35.520]  What you got there?
[22:35.520 --> 22:36.520]  Is that Sonic?
[22:36.520 --> 22:37.520]  Yeah.
[22:37.520 --> 22:38.520]  Yeah.
[22:38.520 --> 22:39.520]  That kind of stuff, it's deezy.
[22:39.520 --> 22:40.520]  There's nothing at Sonic for me, honestly.
[22:40.520 --> 22:41.520]  Yeah.
[22:41.520 --> 22:42.520]  There's nothing there.
[22:42.520 --> 22:43.520]  McDonald's offers nothing for me.
[22:43.520 --> 22:45.520]  You probably don't eat at many fast food places.
[22:45.520 --> 22:50.520]  No, I get sometimes Jimmy John's, if that's even, you know what I mean?
[22:50.520 --> 22:53.520]  A Qdoba and Chipotle because you can get a veggie burrito there.
[22:53.520 --> 22:54.520]  That's pretty much the options.
[22:54.520 --> 22:59.520]  The beans at both those places taste like hell, so you just got to deal with it.
[22:59.520 --> 23:03.520]  See, even vegetarians, well, of course, vegetarians know what's up with a good batch of beans.
[23:03.520 --> 23:04.520]  Oh, yeah.
[23:04.520 --> 23:06.520]  I made a Facebook post the other day about-
[23:06.520 --> 23:08.520]  Sorry, that microphone stands a little limp on you, bro.
[23:08.520 --> 23:09.520]  That sucks.
[23:09.520 --> 23:10.520]  It's cool.
[23:10.520 --> 23:11.520]  All right.
[23:11.520 --> 23:15.520]  About if you know the smell of good, or if you can tell good beans based on smell alone.
[23:15.520 --> 23:16.520]  You might be from Pueblo.
[23:16.520 --> 23:17.520]  Yeah.
[23:17.520 --> 23:18.520]  Yeah.
[23:18.520 --> 23:19.520]  They got to have that rich, earthy smell to them and not too salty.
[23:19.520 --> 23:20.520]  Yep.
[23:20.520 --> 23:21.520]  Yeah.
[23:21.520 --> 23:22.520]  Yeah.
[23:22.520 --> 23:23.520]  All right.
[23:23.520 --> 23:24.520]  But we need more like a Panera.
[23:24.520 --> 23:25.520]  Yeah, that'd be dope.
[23:25.520 --> 23:26.520]  I don't know, just more of that style.
[23:26.520 --> 23:27.520]  We don't even have a Qdoba here.
[23:27.520 --> 23:28.520]  Yeah.
[23:28.520 --> 23:29.520]  We don't have a Qdoba.
[23:29.520 --> 23:30.520]  Just something like that.
[23:30.520 --> 23:31.520]  I like little delis and shit like that.
[23:31.520 --> 23:32.520]  A witch witch?
[23:32.520 --> 23:33.520]  Yeah.
[23:33.520 --> 23:34.520]  Tokyo Joe's?
[23:34.520 --> 23:35.520]  We could go for that kind of shit.
[23:35.520 --> 23:36.520]  Witch witch.
[23:36.520 --> 23:37.520]  Witch witch is, that's the stuff.
[23:37.520 --> 23:38.520]  Yeah.
[23:38.520 --> 23:39.520]  Yeah.
[23:39.520 --> 23:41.520]  All kinds of free advertising for a bunch of shitty restaurants.
[23:41.520 --> 23:47.520]  Shout out to Tomato Joe's in Pueblo on, I think that's Main Street.
[23:47.520 --> 23:48.520]  Can I eat there?
[23:48.520 --> 23:49.520]  It sounds like a place I could eat.
[23:49.520 --> 23:50.520]  They do have a veggie-
[23:50.520 --> 23:51.520]  I'm sure.
[23:51.520 --> 23:52.520]  Sandwich for sure.
[23:52.520 --> 23:53.520]  Yeah.
[23:53.520 --> 23:54.520]  It's just a-
[23:54.520 --> 23:55.520]  Oh, your mic is totally getting away from you.
[23:55.520 --> 23:56.520]  Yeah.
[23:56.520 --> 23:57.520]  Here we go.
[23:57.520 --> 23:58.520]  I got it.
[23:58.520 --> 23:59.520]  You're just going to rock start?
[23:59.520 --> 24:00.520]  Yeah.
[24:00.520 --> 24:01.520]  Is that how you do it on the Colorado podcast?
[24:01.520 --> 24:02.520]  Yeah.
[24:02.520 --> 24:03.520]  We don't have stands.
[24:03.520 --> 24:04.520]  Okay.
[24:04.520 --> 24:05.520]  I apologize for the thing going limp on you.
[24:05.520 --> 24:06.520]  Yeah.
[24:06.520 --> 24:07.520]  They got a couple of veggie sandwiches.
[24:07.520 --> 24:08.520]  Just a little mom and pop on the wall.
[24:08.520 --> 24:09.520]  Fuck it.
[24:09.520 --> 24:10.520]  It's right by the library.
[24:10.520 --> 24:11.520]  Okay.
[24:11.520 --> 24:12.520]  I'm going to go eat there.
[24:12.520 --> 24:13.520]  Those are the best.
[24:13.520 --> 24:14.520]  All right.
[24:14.520 --> 24:15.520]  Let's put this train wreck back on some rails here.
[24:15.520 --> 24:16.520]  Let's talk about cannabis growing.
[24:16.520 --> 24:17.520]  This is not the Colorado podcast.
[24:17.520 --> 24:18.520]  We did not bring 44.
[24:18.520 --> 24:19.520]  Shout out to-
[24:19.520 --> 24:20.520]  Sandwiches.
[24:20.520 --> 24:21.520]  We couldn't bring 44.
[24:21.520 --> 24:22.520]  He's not allowed to go anywhere.
[24:22.520 --> 24:23.520]  Yeah.
[24:23.520 --> 24:24.520]  This is the exclusive.
[24:25.520 --> 24:26.520]  When is that done?
[24:26.520 --> 24:27.520]  Who knows?
[24:27.520 --> 24:28.520]  Who knows?
[24:28.520 --> 24:29.520]  Poor dude.
[24:29.520 --> 24:30.520]  We miss you, bro.
[24:30.520 --> 24:31.520]  Can't wait to see you come out and play again.
[24:31.520 --> 24:32.520]  Jesse wanted to talk about something that I find to be really important that people don't
[24:32.520 --> 24:33.520]  realize.
[24:33.520 --> 24:34.520]  People want to jump into the cannabis industry.
[24:34.520 --> 24:35.520]  People move from all over the country to Colorado, to Washington, to California, to Oregon, to
[24:35.520 --> 24:36.520]  Michigan, to all these places where cannabis growing is legal.
[24:36.520 --> 24:37.520]  They show up here and they've either grown in their basement in an illegal state for
[24:37.520 --> 24:38.520]  a couple of years and had two or three kids, and they're like, I'm going to do this.
[24:38.520 --> 24:39.520]  I'm going to do this.
[24:39.520 --> 24:40.520]  I'm going to do this.
[24:40.520 --> 24:41.520]  I'm going to do this.
[24:41.520 --> 24:42.520]  I'm going to do this.
[24:42.520 --> 24:43.520]  I'm going to do this.
[24:43.520 --> 24:44.520]  I'm going to do this.
[24:44.520 --> 24:45.520]  I'm going to do this.
[24:45.520 --> 24:55.080]  had two or three lights.
[24:55.080 --> 24:57.740]  They set up a small grow here on their garage or their basement.
[24:57.740 --> 25:00.000]  They run four or six lights.
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.040]  Then they think, I'm going to open a big ass grow.
[25:03.040 --> 25:04.760]  They're either going to do it legally or illegally.
[25:04.760 --> 25:06.800]  They're going to get permits or not.
[25:06.800 --> 25:08.440]  Or maybe they're just going to do this in an illegal place.
[25:08.440 --> 25:10.400]  They've been growing in their basement for a while.
[25:10.400 --> 25:12.860]  They're out there in the sticks in Nebraska, and then you're like, fuck it.
[25:12.860 --> 25:13.860]  We're going to buy that old meat plant.
[25:13.860 --> 25:14.960]  We're going to hang us up 100 blocks.
[25:14.960 --> 25:17.200]  And maybe they do it, you know what I mean?
[25:17.200 --> 25:20.960]  So the mistake that a lot of these people fuck up
[25:20.960 --> 25:23.480]  is they don't realize that going from the basement
[25:23.480 --> 25:25.320]  to a large grow facility,
[25:25.320 --> 25:27.980]  it's not just taking this much air conditioning
[25:27.980 --> 25:30.200]  and multiplying at times however more many lights
[25:30.200 --> 25:31.080]  you're gonna work.
[25:31.080 --> 25:32.400]  It doesn't work that way.
[25:32.400 --> 25:35.200]  You run into a whole new shitstew of problems
[25:35.200 --> 25:37.360]  when you start going to big scale growing.
[25:37.360 --> 25:40.080]  The humidity is ridiculously hard to control
[25:40.080 --> 25:41.000]  in a large room.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.560]  Retardedly, yeah, ridiculously.
[25:44.240 --> 25:46.400]  You can say that word, don't worry.
[25:46.400 --> 25:49.080]  It bugs me a little bit personally.
[25:49.080 --> 25:50.360]  Everyone's evolving.
[25:50.360 --> 25:51.520]  Well, yeah.
[25:51.520 --> 25:54.960]  All right, it's hard as shit to remove a lot of humidity
[25:54.960 --> 25:56.260]  in a very large room.
[25:56.260 --> 25:58.280]  It's also hard to regulate the temperature
[25:58.280 --> 26:00.300]  and the airflow and the CO2.
[26:00.300 --> 26:01.960]  So there's a lot of tricks to it.
[26:03.240 --> 26:05.200]  What's the biggest mistake you see people make
[26:05.200 --> 26:07.240]  when they go from, when a dude goes
[26:07.240 --> 26:08.520]  and just builds his first big,
[26:08.520 --> 26:11.280]  when new people get their OPC license
[26:11.280 --> 26:13.040]  and they can build a grow, where do they fuck up?
[26:13.040 --> 26:13.880]  Air conditioning.
[26:13.880 --> 26:14.960]  Always air conditioning, right?
[26:14.960 --> 26:15.800]  Air conditioning.
[26:15.800 --> 26:16.640]  They don't buy enough.
[26:16.640 --> 26:17.840]  And humidity never even gets considered
[26:17.840 --> 26:20.400]  because they think this is the desert.
[26:20.400 --> 26:21.600]  I mean, it is the desert,
[26:21.600 --> 26:23.120]  but they think it's not gonna be an issue
[26:23.120 --> 26:24.240]  because it's so dry here.
[26:24.240 --> 26:25.080]  Right.
[26:25.080 --> 26:25.900]  That's a bunch of BS.
[26:25.900 --> 26:27.720]  You're gonna go pumping water into those plants
[26:27.720 --> 26:28.760]  every single day.
[26:28.760 --> 26:29.920]  And they transpire.
[26:29.920 --> 26:31.480]  And there are a thousand watt lights,
[26:31.480 --> 26:33.240]  a bunch of them right above those plants
[26:33.240 --> 26:34.960]  and the water wants to come out
[26:34.960 --> 26:36.440]  and go up toward those lights.
[26:36.440 --> 26:37.960]  And then it hangs out up by the ceiling
[26:37.960 --> 26:40.620]  and then it falls back down and then it hangs out
[26:40.620 --> 26:42.000]  and it gets between two leaves
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.720]  and it festers for a couple of days.
[26:43.720 --> 26:45.560]  And then you know what it does?
[26:45.560 --> 26:47.440]  It turns into fucking powdery mildew.
[26:47.440 --> 26:48.280]  Yep.
[26:48.280 --> 26:49.100]  So.
[26:49.100 --> 26:49.940]  The spores are there.
[26:49.940 --> 26:50.960]  It just starts flowering.
[26:50.960 --> 26:51.800]  Yep.
[26:51.800 --> 26:53.920]  It's just waiting for you to give it the prime condition.
[26:53.920 --> 26:54.760]  Yeah.
[26:54.760 --> 26:56.380]  That whole grow room is the perfect condition
[26:56.380 --> 27:01.180]  for bugs and fucking funguses and problems.
[27:01.180 --> 27:02.740]  So the air conditioning and the humidity
[27:02.740 --> 27:05.360]  are always definitely the first thing that I think of.
[27:05.360 --> 27:06.200]  Yeah.
[27:06.200 --> 27:08.240]  It's a big grow room is a,
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.400]  it's a living organism that is full of lots of other
[27:11.400 --> 27:13.960]  smaller living organisms.
[27:13.960 --> 27:17.480]  It, I was explaining it to a buddy this way earlier today.
[27:17.480 --> 27:21.800]  And it itself has special care that needs done to it.
[27:21.800 --> 27:22.640]  Right.
[27:22.640 --> 27:23.640]  Not just the plants inside of it.
[27:23.640 --> 27:26.760]  It's, there's a lot to it.
[27:26.760 --> 27:30.040]  We've got 85 lights in the flower room
[27:30.040 --> 27:30.880]  at Green and Healthy.
[27:30.880 --> 27:31.720]  Damn.
[27:31.720 --> 27:35.480]  And we run 50, that's 50 tons.
[27:35.480 --> 27:37.520]  We've got a 30 in the middle and two tens
[27:37.520 --> 27:39.200]  on the opposite sides.
[27:39.200 --> 27:41.400]  50 tons of air conditioning to cool that.
[27:41.400 --> 27:43.160]  And you got three air, see that's smart.
[27:43.160 --> 27:44.200]  Three air conditioners.
[27:44.200 --> 27:45.040]  Right.
[27:45.040 --> 27:45.880]  Yeah.
[27:45.880 --> 27:46.700]  If one goes down.
[27:46.700 --> 27:47.720]  We got two backups that can kind of,
[27:47.720 --> 27:49.520]  if the 30 goes down, it gets warm.
[27:49.520 --> 27:50.360]  I bet it does.
[27:50.360 --> 27:51.920]  But luckily we're running Govitas
[27:51.920 --> 27:53.320]  with the Govita master controller.
[27:53.320 --> 27:55.520]  So you tell it that it just gets above 86 in here.
[27:55.520 --> 27:58.400]  I want you to dim the lights until it gets back down to 77.
[27:58.400 --> 28:00.400]  And then you can go back up if you need to.
[28:00.400 --> 28:01.240]  Yeah.
[28:01.240 --> 28:02.680]  That Govita master controller is awesome.
[28:02.680 --> 28:03.520]  Nice.
[28:03.520 --> 28:05.000]  We have to run two of them because we have so many lights.
[28:05.000 --> 28:05.840]  Yeah.
[28:05.840 --> 28:07.120]  But I mean, they're so easy to program
[28:07.120 --> 28:08.240]  that it doesn't even matter.
[28:08.240 --> 28:09.800]  They're 50 lights each, aren't they?
[28:09.800 --> 28:11.360]  I think they only do 40.
[28:11.360 --> 28:12.840]  Really?
[28:12.840 --> 28:15.440]  Yeah, they have to do 50 because we're on 85 lights.
[28:15.440 --> 28:16.280]  Yeah.
[28:16.280 --> 28:17.100]  So yeah.
[28:17.100 --> 28:20.120]  The Nanos do 199 each.
[28:20.120 --> 28:20.960]  Nice.
[28:20.960 --> 28:22.960]  That's, but see what sucks about that
[28:22.960 --> 28:25.800]  is you still might have to buy multiple units
[28:25.800 --> 28:27.360]  if they're in different rooms.
[28:27.360 --> 28:28.200]  Oh yeah.
[28:28.200 --> 28:29.020]  Because you can't break them into zones.
[28:29.020 --> 28:29.860]  Right, right.
[28:29.860 --> 28:30.700]  Yeah.
[28:30.700 --> 28:33.040]  Luckily our room is one 85 light, big,
[28:33.040 --> 28:36.760]  giant open room with like six rows of madness in it
[28:36.760 --> 28:37.600]  right now.
[28:37.600 --> 28:39.640]  Shout out to my friends at Veg Bloom.
[28:39.640 --> 28:42.760]  If you are growing on a small scale, a medium scale,
[28:42.760 --> 28:45.880]  or a large scale and you want nutrients to push your garden
[28:45.880 --> 28:48.040]  and you want to see what you can really do,
[28:49.280 --> 28:51.920]  fucking Veg Bloom is something I would recommend.
[28:51.920 --> 28:54.200]  It's affordable, it's easy to use.
[28:54.200 --> 28:57.520]  And so far I'm six, no, I'm seven weeks in
[28:57.520 --> 28:58.980]  and this is the best grow I've done
[28:58.980 --> 29:00.980]  at the Greener and Healthy Wellness Garden.
[29:00.980 --> 29:02.840]  And there's a run right next to it
[29:04.040 --> 29:06.000]  that was not Veg Bloom.
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.400]  And I've already,
[29:08.160 --> 29:09.760]  I've already passed the size of those buds.
[29:09.760 --> 29:11.960]  They're being harvested at week nine
[29:11.960 --> 29:13.360]  and these other buds are at week seven
[29:13.360 --> 29:15.680]  and they're already bigger than the week nine buds.
[29:15.680 --> 29:17.080]  So I support Veg Bloom.
[29:17.080 --> 29:19.400]  You're gonna do three at light this one.
[29:19.400 --> 29:20.920]  That would be awesome.
[29:20.920 --> 29:21.760]  That would, yeah.
[29:21.760 --> 29:24.100]  I mean, that's the only place you could go
[29:24.100 --> 29:25.360]  from your last performance.
[29:25.360 --> 29:26.200]  Right, yeah.
[29:26.200 --> 29:28.760]  Last time we crushed it, we did pretty damn well.
[29:28.760 --> 29:30.420]  Shout out to the boys at Greener and Healthy Wellness
[29:30.420 --> 29:32.440]  and the whole Terp Jungle for helping me out.
[29:32.440 --> 29:33.920]  I appreciate it.
[29:33.920 --> 29:36.120]  Even shout out to the new guy.
[29:36.120 --> 29:37.440]  So not enough air conditioning
[29:37.440 --> 29:40.520]  and then nobody considers getting rid of the humidity.
[29:40.520 --> 29:42.800]  There needs to be an exit for all of the moisture
[29:42.800 --> 29:44.040]  that comes into the room.
[29:44.040 --> 29:45.760]  You might be filling the room with CO2, cool,
[29:45.760 --> 29:48.240]  but where is all of that old stagnant air going
[29:48.240 --> 29:49.080]  that's in there?
[29:49.080 --> 29:50.520]  You need to get rid of that shit.
[29:50.520 --> 29:51.360]  You don't wanna be in there.
[29:51.360 --> 29:54.920]  If you walk into the grow room and it feels funky to you,
[29:54.920 --> 29:56.100]  it feels funky to the plants.
[29:56.100 --> 29:58.680]  You should be able to close your eyes and breathe
[29:58.680 --> 30:01.600]  and not notice that you've walked into a grow.
[30:01.600 --> 30:02.800]  It should just feel like normal,
[30:02.800 --> 30:04.200]  like this living room right here.
[30:04.840 --> 30:06.800]  Swamp cooler going, it's a little funky in here,
[30:06.800 --> 30:08.640]  but we got a little dampness in the shower
[30:08.640 --> 30:09.480]  from the swamp cooler,
[30:09.480 --> 30:12.380]  but it was like 90 something degrees today, man.
[30:14.760 --> 30:15.760]  Things I've noticed,
[30:15.760 --> 30:19.080]  humid like we were talking earlier, foliar spraying,
[30:19.080 --> 30:22.960]  you know, how even just watering, brewing a damn tea,
[30:22.960 --> 30:27.240]  you know, brewing 200 gallons of tea can spike the humidity.
[30:27.240 --> 30:28.080]  Oh yeah.
[30:28.080 --> 30:31.200]  You get that 200 gallons of tea too close to the lights
[30:31.200 --> 30:32.440]  and it just starts evaporating.
[30:32.440 --> 30:33.720]  It heats up the teas.
[30:34.360 --> 30:35.960]  All that moisture in the room carries heat
[30:35.960 --> 30:37.320]  and heats up the room as well.
[30:37.320 --> 30:38.200]  Yeah.
[30:38.200 --> 30:40.440]  You go through the hot and cold cycles naturally
[30:40.440 --> 30:42.440]  through the day at the building getting heated up.
[30:42.440 --> 30:46.600]  And I mean, most of these grows are in fairly thin shell,
[30:46.600 --> 30:49.880]  commercial warehouses that aren't insulated
[30:49.880 --> 30:51.320]  as well as they could be.
[30:51.320 --> 30:55.680]  And, you know, so you get the heating and cooling effect
[30:55.680 --> 30:58.400]  from, you know, just the natural outside temperature.
[30:58.400 --> 31:01.640]  We had to build a concrete wall on the outside.
[31:01.640 --> 31:03.920]  We had to defer it is I think the construction term.
[31:03.920 --> 31:06.880]  We had to defer a wall out six inches with concrete
[31:06.880 --> 31:09.160]  to kind of insulate ourselves a little bit.
[31:09.160 --> 31:11.480]  Well, I'm glad to hear that you're not the only,
[31:11.480 --> 31:14.520]  I'm not the only person that might have to do this.
[31:15.680 --> 31:20.200]  The east wall of our facility right about,
[31:20.200 --> 31:22.280]  or no, the west wall, my bad.
[31:22.280 --> 31:26.800]  The west wall of the facility, the way it all sits,
[31:26.800 --> 31:29.360]  as the sun starts going down, it just bakes it.
[31:29.360 --> 31:33.560]  And the wall goes, you know, from being in the seventies
[31:33.560 --> 31:35.920]  all the way up into it's radiating heat.
[31:35.920 --> 31:36.760]  I can feel it.
[31:36.760 --> 31:39.000]  You can see those waves coming off when you go outside.
[31:39.000 --> 31:39.840]  Yeah.
[31:39.840 --> 31:41.040]  Ours was the exact opposite.
[31:41.040 --> 31:44.120]  When the winter came, it got so cold on that wall
[31:44.120 --> 31:46.440]  that we could see moisture on the inside of the wall.
[31:46.440 --> 31:47.280]  Oh, okay.
[31:47.280 --> 31:48.120]  Yeah, cause I mean.
[31:48.120 --> 31:48.940]  Oh, fuck.
[31:48.940 --> 31:49.780]  Yeah.
[31:49.780 --> 31:51.200]  That wall's gonna do that too if we don't fix it.
[31:51.200 --> 31:52.040]  Yeah, it is.
[31:52.040 --> 31:52.920]  Your wall's gonna do the same thing.
[31:52.920 --> 31:54.880]  And then you'll get a PM issue
[31:54.880 --> 31:56.520]  because you're introducing moisture right there
[31:56.520 --> 31:58.800]  and that temperature fluctuation near that wall.
[31:59.240 --> 32:00.080]  Yep.
[32:00.080 --> 32:01.360]  Learn everything the damn hard way.
[32:01.360 --> 32:02.640]  Oh yeah, no.
[32:02.640 --> 32:03.720]  I wouldn't have it any other way.
[32:03.720 --> 32:06.800]  You should have seen the guys that did the concrete
[32:06.800 --> 32:08.720]  over the front of the building.
[32:08.720 --> 32:11.920]  There were three dudes that didn't speak much English.
[32:11.920 --> 32:14.540]  They showed up in a truck with a truck, a wheelbarrow,
[32:14.540 --> 32:18.000]  a whole bunch of cement and some janky scaffolding.
[32:18.000 --> 32:18.840]  Oh yeah.
[32:18.840 --> 32:21.120]  Two dudes carried the scaffolding to where they needed to be
[32:21.120 --> 32:23.080]  and they just pointed and grunted a couple of times,
[32:23.080 --> 32:25.440]  right here, right here, right here.
[32:25.440 --> 32:28.040]  They set up the first level and then one dude climbed that
[32:28.040 --> 32:30.080]  and they threw parts to him while he was standing
[32:30.080 --> 32:31.880]  on the scaffolding and he stuck them in place
[32:31.880 --> 32:35.200]  and then climbed up that and hung and grabbed other shit
[32:35.200 --> 32:38.120]  and built like a four-story scaffold by himself,
[32:38.120 --> 32:39.800]  climbed up and down it like a spider monkey.
[32:39.800 --> 32:41.100]  Scared the shit out of me.
[32:42.600 --> 32:44.200]  So they start the cement from the top
[32:44.200 --> 32:45.780]  and let it run down kinda.
[32:45.780 --> 32:47.680]  And he's up on the top of the scaffolding
[32:47.680 --> 32:49.040]  and he yells, uno!
[32:49.040 --> 32:51.140]  And the guy on the bottom's mixing cement in a wheelbarrow
[32:51.140 --> 32:53.100]  with those little trowel things in his hand
[32:53.100 --> 32:55.480]  and he puts a pile on the thing and throws,
[32:55.480 --> 32:57.840]  he doesn't throw the tool, but he throws the concrete.
[32:58.640 --> 33:01.200]  Just chucks it up into the air between the scaffolding
[33:01.200 --> 33:02.840]  and the dude up top puts his trowel down,
[33:02.840 --> 33:05.320]  doesn't even look, catches that fucking cement on it
[33:05.320 --> 33:07.680]  and smears it on the wall like Daniel's son.
[33:07.680 --> 33:09.120]  Left, right, left, right, left, right.
[33:09.120 --> 33:10.320]  And then he yells, dos!
[33:10.320 --> 33:11.440]  And the guy throws two of them up
[33:11.440 --> 33:13.140]  and he puts both of his little tools down
[33:13.140 --> 33:15.280]  and catches both of them and smears it on the wall
[33:15.280 --> 33:17.600]  and he's running left and right and he's yelling, uno!
[33:17.600 --> 33:18.440]  Dos!
[33:18.440 --> 33:20.400]  As he gets to the middle and the guy throws how many he needs
[33:20.400 --> 33:22.320]  and he just keeps fucking smearing it.
[33:22.320 --> 33:24.420]  And as it's coming down, he goes to the top
[33:24.420 --> 33:26.560]  and pushes it down and then jumps to the next level
[33:26.560 --> 33:28.520]  and repeats and then they got it all done
[33:28.520 --> 33:29.640]  and went back and smoothed it out.
[33:29.640 --> 33:31.960]  It took these three dudes seriously two hours
[33:31.960 --> 33:34.360]  to do the entire front of this fucking building, dude.
[33:34.360 --> 33:35.680]  It was amazing.
[33:35.680 --> 33:38.240]  Yeah, I would hire those guys for fucking anything.
[33:40.640 --> 33:41.640]  So fuck you, Trump.
[33:41.640 --> 33:42.480]  Yeah.
[33:42.480 --> 33:44.560]  A hard working motherfuckers.
[33:44.560 --> 33:45.940]  I mean, you know my background.
[33:45.940 --> 33:49.280]  I worked in the construction industry for over a decade
[33:49.280 --> 33:53.260]  and there's a reason why there's not that many white guys
[33:53.260 --> 33:55.720]  employed in the construction industry anymore.
[33:56.120 --> 33:58.120]  So yeah, take that, Trump.
[33:58.120 --> 33:59.560]  Yeah, fuck you, Trump.
[33:59.560 --> 34:01.600]  I have no problem with hiring some illegals
[34:01.600 --> 34:02.880]  to come do some construction work.
[34:02.880 --> 34:04.560]  They do the shit that white people think
[34:04.560 --> 34:05.400]  they're too good to do.
[34:05.400 --> 34:06.220]  That's the truth.
[34:06.220 --> 34:07.680]  Fuck yeah, you couldn't pay me enough
[34:07.680 --> 34:09.280]  to do some of the shit that some of those guys would do
[34:09.280 --> 34:11.600]  just to make enough money to send home to their family.
[34:11.600 --> 34:13.040]  And I have no problem with that.
[34:13.040 --> 34:13.880]  Do your thing.
[34:13.880 --> 34:14.900]  Asphalt and black tar roofing,
[34:14.900 --> 34:17.400]  I do draw the line there without a doubt.
[34:17.400 --> 34:18.240]  Yeah.
[34:18.240 --> 34:20.800]  I'm fucking white as this paper.
[34:20.800 --> 34:22.840]  You don't want me on a roof.
[34:22.840 --> 34:24.040]  No.
[34:24.040 --> 34:26.720]  Honestly, any kind of roofing I draw the line at,
[34:26.720 --> 34:28.600]  to be honest, it's horrible.
[34:28.600 --> 34:31.400]  All right, so you gotta get air conditioning and humidity.
[34:31.400 --> 34:32.240]  You gotta have an exit.
[34:32.240 --> 34:35.040]  You gotta have a vent drawing stale air out of the building
[34:35.040 --> 34:36.240]  and getting it out of the ceiling.
[34:36.240 --> 34:38.240]  That's something super important
[34:38.240 --> 34:40.120]  when you're going from a basement grow
[34:40.120 --> 34:42.280]  to a larger commercial grow.
[34:42.280 --> 34:45.360]  Do you guys have to run carbon filters?
[34:49.040 --> 34:52.520]  We should be, but we're allowed one more complaint
[34:52.520 --> 34:54.320]  before we get in trouble.
[34:54.320 --> 34:55.960]  I understand that, that's economics.
[34:55.960 --> 35:00.960]  The fine is cheaper than the filters that we need.
[35:03.840 --> 35:07.560]  We had to, here in Pueblo, that was,
[35:07.560 --> 35:09.880]  they immediately, that was like one of their big concerns
[35:09.880 --> 35:11.040]  was carbon filters.
[35:11.040 --> 35:11.880]  Yeah.
[35:11.880 --> 35:14.780]  And we've got six of those big fuckers all over ours.
[35:14.780 --> 35:17.840]  We've even got the inline ones on our air cooled lights.
[35:17.840 --> 35:20.760]  We're disgustingly lucky because across the street from us
[35:20.800 --> 35:22.800]  is Homeward Bound dog crematorium.
[35:22.800 --> 35:23.640]  Nice.
[35:23.640 --> 35:27.240]  And so every day around noon, you smell garlic bread
[35:27.240 --> 35:30.480]  and then you realize they're fucking cooking animals
[35:30.480 --> 35:31.320]  across the street.
[35:31.320 --> 35:33.560]  That's a dead animal being cremated.
[35:33.560 --> 35:35.360]  So I told the new guy, we got a new guy
[35:35.360 --> 35:36.840]  and I smelled it the other day and I was like,
[35:36.840 --> 35:38.560]  oh, I can't even let him do that.
[35:38.560 --> 35:40.040]  I walked into the other room where he was and go,
[35:40.040 --> 35:41.320]  hey bro, you smell like garlic bread?
[35:41.320 --> 35:42.240]  And he goes, yeah, who's cooking?
[35:42.240 --> 35:44.080]  I go, that's the dog crematorium next door.
[35:44.080 --> 35:45.480]  Don't enjoy it too much.
[35:45.480 --> 35:46.320]  That's Rover.
[35:46.320 --> 35:47.760]  And he just looked at me like, that's,
[35:47.760 --> 35:49.440]  he said, that's fluffy.
[35:49.440 --> 35:52.400]  I was like, yeah, they're just roasting that motherfucker.
[35:52.400 --> 35:54.800]  And it's funny because the first few days I worked there,
[35:54.800 --> 35:57.220]  I smelled something and there were two girls
[35:57.220 --> 35:59.080]  that used to work there that are no longer affiliated
[35:59.080 --> 36:00.480]  with us, but they used to work there.
[36:00.480 --> 36:02.680]  They'd be like every day at like noon or two o'clock,
[36:02.680 --> 36:04.840]  I smelled garlic bread and they were standing
[36:04.840 --> 36:06.440]  in the groom just sucking it in one day.
[36:06.440 --> 36:07.720]  Like, where is it?
[36:07.720 --> 36:09.360]  It smells so good.
[36:09.360 --> 36:11.600]  And once I realized what it was a few days later,
[36:11.600 --> 36:13.800]  I was like, those girls were loving the smell
[36:13.800 --> 36:16.720]  of burnt puppies, fried kittens.
[36:16.720 --> 36:17.720]  Oh man.
[36:17.720 --> 36:19.480]  Sorry, this podcast just got really morbid.
[36:19.480 --> 36:20.320]  That's awkward.
[36:21.360 --> 36:25.720]  The reason I brought it up is just carbon filter systems
[36:25.720 --> 36:28.760]  in a home grow versus a commercial grower,
[36:28.760 --> 36:29.720]  drastically different.
[36:29.720 --> 36:31.120]  Hugely different.
[36:31.120 --> 36:32.400]  Yeah.
[36:32.400 --> 36:34.240]  That's why I said what we need is way expensive.
[36:34.240 --> 36:37.400]  We need like HEPA filter grade shit.
[36:37.400 --> 36:39.020]  UV lighting possibly.
[36:40.200 --> 36:42.920]  We've, I've got a small UV light that I use
[36:42.920 --> 36:44.320]  on small plantlings.
[36:44.320 --> 36:45.160]  I run it over.
[36:45.160 --> 36:46.520]  I just walk through the grow room
[36:46.520 --> 36:49.120]  and just hover that light about four to six inches
[36:49.120 --> 36:50.120]  over every little plant.
[36:50.120 --> 36:52.400]  And it keeps them nice and bug free
[36:52.400 --> 36:53.960]  because the bugs want nothing to do with that.
[36:53.960 --> 36:57.800]  And the PM, there is not any.
[36:57.800 --> 36:58.640]  Nice.
[36:58.640 --> 36:59.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[36:59.460 --> 37:00.300]  So that thing is helpful.
[37:00.300 --> 37:01.140]  I was using that on another guy's garden
[37:01.140 --> 37:02.560]  that had bad PM.
[37:02.560 --> 37:03.840]  And I think it took eight days
[37:03.840 --> 37:05.800]  to just deteriorate all the PM.
[37:05.800 --> 37:07.360]  Damn, I gotta get me one of those.
[37:07.360 --> 37:10.520]  I know an old guy that has not enough fucking filtration
[37:10.520 --> 37:12.360]  and refuses to blow the air out of his house
[37:12.360 --> 37:13.520]  because he's afraid.
[37:13.520 --> 37:14.640]  And he keeps getting PM.
[37:14.920 --> 37:17.720]  I keep learning new tricks on how to get rid of it for him.
[37:17.720 --> 37:18.840]  Keeps us on our toes.
[37:18.840 --> 37:20.080]  All right, so filtration is something
[37:20.080 --> 37:21.760]  that you super definitely need.
[37:21.760 --> 37:23.800]  Get that stale, funky air out.
[37:23.800 --> 37:25.580]  You're gonna need UV lighting.
[37:25.580 --> 37:27.320]  You're gonna need HEPA filtration.
[37:27.320 --> 37:29.640]  Your air conditioners have exchanges
[37:29.640 --> 37:31.980]  and they're gonna pull the air from the grow room
[37:31.980 --> 37:33.480]  and that's gonna blow back into your grow.
[37:33.480 --> 37:35.760]  But also a large portion of that is going to escape
[37:35.760 --> 37:36.920]  into the outside atmosphere.
[37:36.920 --> 37:39.600]  So you're gonna be stinking it up that way also.
[37:39.600 --> 37:41.880]  So you need carbon scrubbers inside the grow.
[37:42.400 --> 37:44.640]  It's pretty fucking hard to keep the smell contained.
[37:44.640 --> 37:45.560]  It's so hard.
[37:45.560 --> 37:46.640]  If we didn't have a...
[37:46.640 --> 37:48.720]  And they came to us and they're like,
[37:48.720 --> 37:50.880]  hey, we can smell cannabis.
[37:50.880 --> 37:52.880]  And we're like, yeah, we try to keep the smell down.
[37:52.880 --> 37:54.280]  How do you know it's us?
[37:54.280 --> 37:55.960]  And they said, well, we've been to all the other grows
[37:55.960 --> 37:58.080]  and you guys seem to know more what you're doing.
[37:58.080 --> 37:59.920]  And they basically gave us a compliment.
[37:59.920 --> 38:02.120]  The MED in the city loves us.
[38:02.120 --> 38:03.040]  Because we're friends with them.
[38:03.040 --> 38:04.100]  I mean, we don't hide from them.
[38:04.100 --> 38:05.320]  There are some dispensary owners
[38:05.320 --> 38:06.720]  that don't get along with those people
[38:06.720 --> 38:08.160]  because they're shifty dicks.
[38:08.160 --> 38:10.920]  And they're just keeping it real.
[38:10.920 --> 38:12.040]  And we're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:12.040 --> 38:12.880]  They're keeping it real
[38:12.880 --> 38:14.680]  and we're trying to be on the legit side.
[38:14.680 --> 38:16.160]  So we're cool when they come over.
[38:16.160 --> 38:17.160]  When, hey, what's up?
[38:17.160 --> 38:18.000]  I'm actually...
[38:19.720 --> 38:21.760]  I'm looking forward to our first visit
[38:21.760 --> 38:24.040]  because the place I work at now is completely different
[38:24.040 --> 38:26.440]  than some of the other places I've worked at.
[38:26.440 --> 38:28.680]  It's nice when you can look forward to MED visits, right?
[38:28.680 --> 38:30.360]  I know they'll have some issues.
[38:30.360 --> 38:31.200]  I'm sure they will.
[38:31.200 --> 38:33.360]  They're always going to, that's their job.
[38:33.360 --> 38:35.440]  But I'm not scared of anything.
[38:35.440 --> 38:36.280]  Yeah.
[38:36.280 --> 38:38.760]  That's anything that we have messed up on,
[38:38.760 --> 38:42.280]  it's either because we didn't understand it properly or...
[38:42.280 --> 38:43.120]  Right.
[38:43.120 --> 38:43.960]  You know, just...
[38:43.960 --> 38:46.480]  Invite the Department of Agriculture in for a walkthrough.
[38:46.480 --> 38:47.600]  Like invite them.
[38:47.600 --> 38:48.840]  And then if you invite them,
[38:48.840 --> 38:51.600]  they won't give you any violations for whatever they find.
[38:51.600 --> 38:53.800]  They'll tell you to correct it since you invited them.
[38:53.800 --> 38:56.160]  And they'll be like, you've got 90 days to get it corrected.
[38:56.160 --> 38:57.600]  And when we come back,
[38:57.600 --> 38:59.960]  that's when we'll actually be able to put you
[38:59.960 --> 39:01.960]  on like a warning notice.
[39:01.960 --> 39:03.280]  Yeah, so if you invite them,
[39:03.280 --> 39:04.960]  they show up and they're like, oh, good job.
[39:04.960 --> 39:05.800]  Thank you.
[39:05.800 --> 39:06.620]  And then you can be like, I need help.
[39:06.620 --> 39:08.400]  Come show me what to correct.
[39:09.040 --> 39:09.880]  And that's kind of the way to do
[39:09.880 --> 39:10.720]  with the Department of Ag.
[39:10.720 --> 39:12.880]  The guy that's been going around is fucking cool.
[39:12.880 --> 39:14.720]  I can't think of his name right now.
[39:14.720 --> 39:16.440]  Oh, I can almost remember his name in my head,
[39:16.440 --> 39:17.440]  but he's a cool little dude.
[39:17.440 --> 39:18.280]  He's an older dude.
[39:18.280 --> 39:19.280]  He's kind of a short guy, but he's cool.
[39:19.280 --> 39:20.120]  He's fun to hang out with.
[39:20.120 --> 39:22.560]  He's very informative, very educational.
[39:22.560 --> 39:24.160]  And he'll talk to you like you're a human.
[39:24.160 --> 39:25.720]  He won't treat you like a stupid grower,
[39:25.720 --> 39:27.560]  like some of the industry people do.
[39:27.560 --> 39:29.400]  Like electricians and HVAC guys
[39:29.400 --> 39:31.200]  trying to talk to us like we're fucking retarded.
[39:31.200 --> 39:33.000]  HVAC guys, oh my God.
[39:33.000 --> 39:33.840]  Yeah.
[39:33.840 --> 39:34.680]  Yeah.
[39:34.680 --> 39:35.960]  I was dealing with one yesterday.
[39:35.960 --> 39:38.760]  I was about ready to strangle the guy.
[39:38.760 --> 39:40.400]  I just had to walk out of the office.
[39:40.400 --> 39:42.320]  I'm like, yeah, you're a fucking idiot, sorry.
[39:42.320 --> 39:44.240]  Yeah, sometimes some contractors
[39:44.240 --> 39:45.520]  are a pain in the ass to deal with.
[39:45.520 --> 39:47.800]  So that's something to look forward to.
[39:47.800 --> 39:49.000]  When you're building your big grow,
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.800]  find some contractors that you can trust.
[39:51.800 --> 39:54.640]  In Pueblo, good fucking luck if you're in Pueblo, Colorado.
[39:54.640 --> 39:56.800]  You'd be better off paying crews from Denver
[39:56.800 --> 39:58.720]  to come down and build your grow, in my opinion.
[39:58.720 --> 39:59.800]  Gagliano.
[39:59.800 --> 40:02.400]  Is that a good builder?
[40:02.400 --> 40:03.280]  He's decent.
[40:03.280 --> 40:04.120]  Okay.
[40:04.120 --> 40:06.800]  He's very connected in the city.
[40:06.800 --> 40:09.640]  He knows, he's on first name basis with everyone.
[40:09.640 --> 40:10.480]  Okay.
[40:10.480 --> 40:11.320]  So shit goes pretty smoothly.
[40:11.320 --> 40:12.160]  All right, so check this out.
[40:12.160 --> 40:14.800]  If you're trying to get a grow built in Colorado,
[40:14.800 --> 40:16.560]  in the Pueblo, Colorado region,
[40:16.560 --> 40:19.240]  find a guy who does construction by the name of Gagliano.
[40:19.240 --> 40:21.640]  Gagliano's Construction in Pueblo, Colorado.
[40:21.640 --> 40:22.840]  When you contact them, be like,
[40:22.840 --> 40:25.040]  hey, I was listening to a podcast.
[40:25.040 --> 40:26.600]  This guy named Ross DeJeff told me about you.
[40:26.600 --> 40:28.160]  So anything that we do business with,
[40:28.160 --> 40:30.200]  you owe him 2% commission.
[40:30.200 --> 40:31.040]  Yeah.
[40:31.040 --> 40:32.240]  And just make sure that he sends me 2%.
[40:32.240 --> 40:34.000]  2% is not a lot to ask for.
[40:34.840 --> 40:37.160]  It's not, it's 2%.
[40:37.160 --> 40:38.400]  Like if you got a dollar, you'd give me,
[40:38.400 --> 40:40.000]  if you had a dollar in exchange,
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.280]  that's where I'm headed with this.
[40:41.280 --> 40:42.880]  If it was in coins on the floor,
[40:42.880 --> 40:44.680]  you wouldn't care if I picked up two pennies.
[40:44.680 --> 40:45.520]  Nope, not a bit.
[40:45.520 --> 40:46.360]  Two pennies, bro.
[40:46.360 --> 40:47.760]  If you gotta break a buck, I get it.
[40:47.760 --> 40:50.000]  That's breaking the big one.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.480]  But if you got the soft 100 pennies,
[40:52.480 --> 40:53.980]  then you can take two of them.
[40:55.080 --> 40:57.280]  Find yourself a good contractor is the point of all this.
[40:57.280 --> 40:58.120]  Yes.
[40:58.120 --> 40:59.480]  Yeah, because contractors can fuck up your whole day.
[40:59.480 --> 41:01.160]  I worked at another facility
[41:01.160 --> 41:03.600]  that the blueprint was drawn by one guy.
[41:04.160 --> 41:05.480]  The HVAC system was designed by another.
[41:05.480 --> 41:06.960]  And the electrical, which we're gonna talk about
[41:06.960 --> 41:08.840]  in a minute, was designed by another guy.
[41:08.840 --> 41:12.200]  And they were all, it was like we took a Ferrari engine,
[41:12.200 --> 41:15.280]  maybe a Porsche turbo kit,
[41:15.280 --> 41:17.760]  and then maybe like a Lamborghini body,
[41:17.760 --> 41:20.000]  and then the suspension system for a Corvette.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.080]  And they're like, you got all these dope ass parts.
[41:22.080 --> 41:23.720]  Make it go fast, Ricky Bobby.
[41:23.720 --> 41:25.720]  And like fucking, we're like, eh,
[41:25.720 --> 41:27.560]  but the air conditioning doesn't work
[41:27.560 --> 41:29.000]  when you turn on all the lights.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.760]  Like there's not enough power to do all of it.
[41:31.760 --> 41:35.160]  So like, yeah, you need good contractors, good engineers,
[41:35.160 --> 41:36.680]  a fucking engineer.
[41:36.680 --> 41:40.120]  That's very key is an engineer that understands.
[41:40.120 --> 41:43.440]  Cause you're not always gonna find a contractor
[41:43.440 --> 41:45.400]  that understands indoor cultivation.
[41:45.400 --> 41:47.520]  They don't understand how much humidity is coming.
[41:47.520 --> 41:50.640]  Rarely we'll find a contractor that understands it.
[41:50.640 --> 41:54.080]  But you can find engineers that know what they're doing.
[41:54.080 --> 41:55.920]  And engineers are smart people.
[41:55.920 --> 41:57.920]  You can explain shit to them.
[41:57.920 --> 42:01.680]  So yeah, that was real key in the Uncle Bud company
[42:02.600 --> 42:03.440]  and the development.
[42:03.440 --> 42:04.280]  We had a really good engineer.
[42:04.280 --> 42:05.120]  Let's talk about that in a minute.
[42:05.120 --> 42:06.240]  Also, I'll let you give them a nice plug.
[42:06.240 --> 42:08.160]  I'm gonna write it down so that I remember.
[42:08.160 --> 42:12.480]  I was able to relay concerns I had to them.
[42:12.480 --> 42:14.080]  And I'm like, you know,
[42:14.080 --> 42:15.720]  we gotta make sure this doesn't happen.
[42:15.720 --> 42:16.640]  Like electricity.
[42:16.640 --> 42:18.680]  I was like, we just have to have plenty of electricity.
[42:18.680 --> 42:20.800]  Plenty, three phase power all day long.
[42:20.800 --> 42:23.480]  Yeah, well, not quite, but we got two meters, so.
[42:23.480 --> 42:24.320]  Okay.
[42:25.320 --> 42:27.240]  How many amps are you allowed to pull?
[42:27.240 --> 42:29.080]  We were 400 on both.
[42:29.080 --> 42:30.640]  That's on each box?
[42:30.880 --> 42:32.200]  So you get 800 total amps?
[42:32.200 --> 42:34.520]  Nowhere near drawing full capacity at the moment.
[42:34.520 --> 42:35.880]  That's a lot of amperage.
[42:35.880 --> 42:37.080]  Yeah, that's a lot.
[42:37.080 --> 42:39.600]  Did you get to flip the fucking on switch?
[42:39.600 --> 42:41.080]  We've got two inside.
[42:41.080 --> 42:41.920]  Have you ever done it?
[42:41.920 --> 42:42.760]  Yeah.
[42:42.760 --> 42:45.200]  Does it feel ridiculous when the contacts touch?
[42:45.200 --> 42:46.040]  Yep.
[42:46.040 --> 42:46.880]  All that power?
[42:46.880 --> 42:49.360]  It's not something you can do.
[42:49.360 --> 42:52.040]  Like if you're not strong enough to push it
[42:52.040 --> 42:54.360]  all the way through, you don't wanna do it.
[42:54.360 --> 42:56.600]  Because that's a lot of power.
[42:56.600 --> 42:57.440]  That's a lot of freaking electricity.
[42:57.440 --> 42:59.760]  You don't wanna take a chance to shorten something there.
[42:59.800 --> 43:01.240]  Yeah, oh yeah, you just gotta go.
[43:01.240 --> 43:02.960]  Just push it, yeah.
[43:02.960 --> 43:04.480]  And some smaller folks might not be able
[43:04.480 --> 43:05.320]  to push that thing all the way.
[43:05.320 --> 43:06.160]  Yeah, that's true.
[43:06.160 --> 43:07.000]  You're a little wiry dude.
[43:07.000 --> 43:08.600]  You can see Adam up there trying to push it
[43:08.600 --> 43:09.880]  like Mickey Mouse all day.
[43:09.880 --> 43:11.160]  Adam and 44.
[43:12.320 --> 43:13.280]  Adam and D both.
[43:13.280 --> 43:14.960]  Yeah, D on top trying to.
[43:15.840 --> 43:16.800]  D with his broken hand.
[43:16.800 --> 43:17.880]  Okay, let's stop there.
[43:17.880 --> 43:20.440]  All right, yeah, this is not the Colorado.
[43:20.440 --> 43:21.320]  They don't get any love.
[43:21.320 --> 43:22.280]  What are we talking about?
[43:22.280 --> 43:25.520]  All right, so another thing we kinda touched on this one.
[43:25.520 --> 43:27.840]  Get a fucking certified, qualified,
[43:27.840 --> 43:29.840]  reliable, professional electrician.
[43:29.840 --> 43:30.800]  Yes, very much so.
[43:30.800 --> 43:33.840]  If your contractors do fuck up, you can fire them.
[43:33.840 --> 43:34.680]  Oh yeah.
[43:34.680 --> 43:35.720]  Don't just be like, I hired this guy,
[43:35.720 --> 43:36.560]  gotta stick with him.
[43:36.560 --> 43:37.400]  No, you fucking don't.
[43:37.400 --> 43:38.240]  You're not dating.
[43:38.240 --> 43:39.240]  And you can call them on it,
[43:39.240 --> 43:41.360]  and you can make them come back and fix it,
[43:41.360 --> 43:44.200]  or take away their junk, and you're not gonna pay for it.
[43:44.200 --> 43:45.040]  There you go.
[43:45.040 --> 43:45.880]  That's.
[43:45.880 --> 43:46.720]  Take away their junk.
[43:46.720 --> 43:48.320]  Every contractor has got a pile of his shit
[43:48.320 --> 43:50.200]  in your facility while he's working there.
[43:50.200 --> 43:52.960]  Hold it hostage until you get what the fuck you need.
[43:52.960 --> 43:53.960]  Do that.
[43:53.960 --> 43:55.440]  Now that's kind of a fucked up way to go about it,
[43:55.440 --> 43:56.680]  but if you just lock the doors, and you're like,
[43:56.680 --> 43:57.800]  bro, you done fucked up.
[43:57.800 --> 43:59.240]  My walls are all crooked.
[43:59.240 --> 44:00.920]  Make my walls straight, and then I'll pay you.
[44:00.920 --> 44:03.320]  Then that's, you gotta do shit right.
[44:03.320 --> 44:04.160]  The flooring.
[44:04.160 --> 44:05.240]  Flooring's always been a bitch,
[44:05.240 --> 44:06.380]  and every facility I've been to,
[44:06.380 --> 44:07.560]  the flooring has been an issue.
[44:07.560 --> 44:08.400]  Really?
[44:08.400 --> 44:10.560]  Yeah, it's just hard to get floors right in this industry.
[44:10.560 --> 44:14.080]  I'll have, I've got a brand name of specific paint for you,
[44:14.080 --> 44:15.800]  but I don't know it off the top of my head.
[44:15.800 --> 44:16.640]  I'll let you know.
[44:16.640 --> 44:17.460]  It's been great.
[44:17.460 --> 44:22.000]  I've got one little flake out of 2,000 square feet.
[44:22.000 --> 44:22.840]  Oh shit, yeah.
[44:22.840 --> 44:23.680]  Yeah.
[44:23.680 --> 44:27.200]  It's had almost three months of work on top of it.
[44:27.200 --> 44:28.440]  And I bet you dropped something heavy
[44:28.440 --> 44:29.360]  to get that one chip.
[44:29.360 --> 44:30.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[44:30.840 --> 44:32.520]  The grin on your face is awesome.
[44:32.520 --> 44:34.280]  It was a stainless steel table.
[44:34.280 --> 44:35.120]  They knew it was a table.
[44:35.120 --> 44:37.160]  I fucking knew it was a long ass Hydra table.
[44:37.160 --> 44:38.640]  Yeah.
[44:38.640 --> 44:39.480]  Yeah, I like tables.
[44:39.480 --> 44:40.520]  Put your plants on tables, guys.
[44:40.520 --> 44:41.360]  Raise them up off the ground.
[44:41.360 --> 44:42.400]  Get them up where you can work on them.
[44:42.400 --> 44:43.240]  It's so awesome.
[44:43.240 --> 44:44.060]  I love it.
[44:44.060 --> 44:45.600]  We've got ours on the floor right now.
[44:45.600 --> 44:47.840]  That's something, cleaning,
[44:49.080 --> 44:52.000]  mopping up after six plants, 12 plants is one thing.
[44:52.040 --> 44:57.040]  Mopping up after 176 plants is a completely different story.
[44:57.240 --> 44:59.720]  I've got an assistant grower now.
[44:59.720 --> 45:02.240]  And every few days, he's like,
[45:02.240 --> 45:03.240]  what do you want me to do, bro?
[45:03.240 --> 45:04.440]  And I'm like, just clean up.
[45:04.440 --> 45:05.280]  He's like, seriously?
[45:05.280 --> 45:06.480]  I'm like, yeah, just go fucking,
[45:06.480 --> 45:08.960]  every little random thing that's fallen out of a plant,
[45:08.960 --> 45:11.680]  all the perlite that's on a table or any whatever,
[45:11.680 --> 45:13.200]  if there's a pair of scissors laying around,
[45:13.200 --> 45:14.520]  go clean all that shit.
[45:14.520 --> 45:15.560]  Measuring jars.
[45:15.560 --> 45:16.480]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[45:16.480 --> 45:18.080]  Start from the top in the flower room.
[45:18.080 --> 45:18.920]  Go all the way down.
[45:18.920 --> 45:20.760]  If there's old trellis or old pots in there
[45:20.760 --> 45:21.840]  from something that's been harvested,
[45:22.680 --> 45:23.520]  that's gotta go.
[45:23.520 --> 45:25.240]  Sweep every goddamn corner.
[45:25.240 --> 45:26.600]  Get out the shop vac.
[45:26.600 --> 45:28.720]  Suck up underneath all the weird random
[45:28.720 --> 45:30.960]  little nooks and crannies that we got in there.
[45:30.960 --> 45:33.280]  Anything that's not gonna be used
[45:33.280 --> 45:35.280]  doesn't need to be in the flower room, I don't think.
[45:35.280 --> 45:38.040]  Like scissors and boxes of material.
[45:38.040 --> 45:40.120]  That shit should go in the storage room.
[45:40.120 --> 45:41.240]  Store that.
[45:41.240 --> 45:42.840]  Or put it right outside the flower room.
[45:42.840 --> 45:45.080]  If you're fortunate enough to have a storage room.
[45:45.080 --> 45:47.160]  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:48.560 --> 45:50.280]  Put the broom and dust pan and trash can
[45:50.280 --> 45:51.120]  outside the flower room.
[45:51.280 --> 45:53.600]  You guys put that shit outside.
[45:53.600 --> 45:55.200]  Just don't have that in the flowering room
[45:55.200 --> 45:56.160]  or the bedroom.
[45:56.160 --> 45:58.960]  Simple little tasks that you don't even think
[45:58.960 --> 46:01.160]  about doing in a small grow can literally
[46:01.160 --> 46:02.960]  take days in a big grow.
[46:02.960 --> 46:03.880]  Defoliating.
[46:03.880 --> 46:04.760]  Oh my god.
[46:04.760 --> 46:05.760]  Shaving legs.
[46:05.760 --> 46:07.080]  Shaving legs and defoliating.
[46:07.080 --> 46:07.920]  Staking.
[46:07.920 --> 46:09.720]  I know you guys are all netting,
[46:09.720 --> 46:11.400]  but I'm doing a big seed run,
[46:11.400 --> 46:14.000]  so that wasn't really an option.
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.120]  I like double and triple layer trellising.
[46:16.120 --> 46:17.760]  I get crazy on it.
[46:17.760 --> 46:19.080]  I can't wait.
[46:19.080 --> 46:20.200]  Bend them down.
[46:21.440 --> 46:24.240]  Yeah, it's a lot of work.
[46:24.240 --> 46:25.080]  So much work.
[46:25.080 --> 46:25.920]  I keep saying that, but it is.
[46:25.920 --> 46:27.880]  I've got a guy that,
[46:27.880 --> 46:29.600]  a former employee that would defoliate
[46:29.600 --> 46:31.800]  the entire room for an entire shift.
[46:31.800 --> 46:35.360]  And he would do 10 five gallon buckets
[46:35.360 --> 46:38.000]  full of leaves and he would push them down.
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.760]  Like he would just chop leaves all day
[46:39.760 --> 46:41.440]  and then go back and scoop up the leaves
[46:41.440 --> 46:43.000]  out of the trays into five gallon buckets.
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.800]  And he'd probably fill 10 five gallon buckets.
[46:44.800 --> 46:46.680]  He'd fill one of those big,
[46:46.680 --> 46:48.640]  like 30 gallon trash cans halfway full
[46:48.680 --> 46:52.200]  of just leaves just from the first run of defoliating.
[46:52.200 --> 46:53.600]  Things you don't have to do in the basement.
[46:53.600 --> 46:56.520]  We have to weigh all that and we have to track it.
[46:56.520 --> 46:59.120]  That's, I hate that part of it so much.
[46:59.120 --> 47:01.320]  Document what all that shit weighed.
[47:01.320 --> 47:02.360]  Yeah.
[47:02.360 --> 47:03.440]  Manicured weight.
[47:04.560 --> 47:05.400]  I didn't even manicure it.
[47:05.400 --> 47:06.960]  I just pulled the damn leaf off.
[47:06.960 --> 47:08.120]  So we've got a,
[47:08.920 --> 47:10.240]  you know how you're supposed to like mix it
[47:10.240 --> 47:12.760]  with soil or vinegar, oil or something like that
[47:12.760 --> 47:13.880]  before you can throw it away.
[47:13.880 --> 47:14.720]  Okay, yeah.
[47:14.720 --> 47:15.960]  Let's catch the listeners up though.
[47:15.960 --> 47:17.480]  In a commercial grow,
[47:17.480 --> 47:19.720]  when you, if you have,
[47:19.720 --> 47:21.800]  say maybe a bud isn't desirable
[47:21.800 --> 47:23.760]  or they're the bottom part of the plant.
[47:23.760 --> 47:25.000]  I throw that shit away.
[47:25.000 --> 47:26.040]  When that's in the trash can,
[47:26.040 --> 47:28.280]  you have to cut it up into little tiny pieces.
[47:28.280 --> 47:30.080]  And then you have to mix it, like Jesse said,
[47:30.080 --> 47:33.880]  with soil or kitty litter is what they recommended.
[47:33.880 --> 47:34.720]  Kitty litter, yeah.
[47:34.720 --> 47:38.280]  Or gravel or vinegar or something else
[47:38.280 --> 47:39.120]  that you can put in there.
[47:39.120 --> 47:39.960]  Cooking oil.
[47:39.960 --> 47:40.780]  Cooking oil, yeah.
[47:40.780 --> 47:42.440]  Anything to make it unusable and unrecognizable.
[47:42.440 --> 47:44.680]  So it sounds like you got a good idea.
[47:44.680 --> 47:46.680]  Yeah, we've got three worm farms.
[47:46.680 --> 47:47.520]  There you go.
[47:47.520 --> 47:48.680]  Shit, yeah, feed it to the worms.
[47:48.680 --> 47:49.520]  Yeah.
[47:49.520 --> 47:50.480]  And they're loving it too.
[47:50.480 --> 47:52.440]  Oh, I'm sure they love their can of meal.
[47:52.440 --> 47:53.520]  That's the best.
[47:53.520 --> 47:55.840]  We use a shit ton of worm castings too.
[47:55.840 --> 47:58.440]  So it helps cut down costs there.
[47:58.440 --> 47:59.640]  There you go.
[47:59.640 --> 48:00.720]  Pre-cycling.
[48:00.720 --> 48:01.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[48:01.560 --> 48:02.380]  That's awesome.
[48:02.380 --> 48:04.520]  That's a good way to do it.
[48:04.520 --> 48:07.020]  Yeah, that's when we get our greenhouse built.
[48:08.280 --> 48:10.400]  We've got a whole wall in the greenhouse.
[48:10.400 --> 48:13.320]  It's gonna be a shelf system full of worm bins
[48:13.320 --> 48:14.160]  and everything.
[48:14.160 --> 48:15.680]  Worm shit and into a funnel.
[48:16.640 --> 48:17.720]  It's just a worm shit funnel.
[48:17.720 --> 48:19.080]  Just tunnel it down.
[48:19.080 --> 48:19.960]  Damn, that's pretty rad.
[48:19.960 --> 48:22.120]  We grind it up pretty small.
[48:22.120 --> 48:22.960]  We chop it up.
[48:22.960 --> 48:24.800]  I chop it up with the shears.
[48:25.680 --> 48:27.400]  Just go ham on it with the shears.
[48:27.400 --> 48:29.560]  And then we make lasagna, basically.
[48:29.560 --> 48:32.280]  We take the old pot that the plant's been harvested from
[48:32.280 --> 48:34.280]  and shake that soil into the trash can.
[48:34.280 --> 48:35.120]  We let them dry.
[48:35.120 --> 48:36.880]  They've all sat around and dried for a couple days.
[48:36.880 --> 48:38.680]  Dump all that soil into the trash can.
[48:38.680 --> 48:40.160]  Throw a bunch of the waste into there.
[48:40.160 --> 48:41.920]  Dump a couple more pots, more soil,
[48:41.920 --> 48:43.760]  couple more waste.
[48:43.760 --> 48:44.960]  Yeah, just keep it like that.
[48:45.520 --> 48:47.200]  That's a way to get rid of all of our old soil
[48:47.200 --> 48:49.800]  at the same time and have a use for it
[48:49.800 --> 48:52.080]  instead of just wasting all that good dirt.
[48:52.080 --> 48:53.720]  Because I know it's recyclable.
[48:53.720 --> 48:55.960]  I totally know I could use it.
[48:55.960 --> 48:58.080]  We use so much cocoa.
[48:58.080 --> 49:00.760]  We buy 14 big bags of cocoa at a time when we go
[49:00.760 --> 49:02.920]  because that's what fits in Hunt's car.
[49:02.920 --> 49:04.960]  Oh, you're talking like the big, tall bags of-
[49:04.960 --> 49:05.800]  Those bags that are right there,
[49:05.800 --> 49:07.800]  the 1.75 cubic feet?
[49:07.800 --> 49:09.280]  Those are bigger than your average bag.
[49:09.280 --> 49:10.120]  Yeah, okay.
[49:10.120 --> 49:11.960]  All right, that's what I use at the house now, too,
[49:11.960 --> 49:12.800]  is cocoa.
[49:12.800 --> 49:13.640]  I've upgraded.
[49:14.600 --> 49:15.440]  Shout out to Way2Grow.
[49:15.440 --> 49:17.080]  I hope nobody just heard me burp into that microphone.
[49:17.080 --> 49:17.920]  Excuse me.
[49:17.920 --> 49:19.080]  Shout out to Way2Grow.
[49:19.080 --> 49:20.600]  I was buying Cocoa Grow the other day.
[49:20.600 --> 49:22.760]  I really like the Botanic Hair Cocoa Grow.
[49:22.760 --> 49:25.480]  I don't prefer the aeration bag.
[49:25.480 --> 49:26.320]  Just get the cocoa.
[49:26.320 --> 49:27.140]  It's just fine.
[49:27.140 --> 49:27.980]  You don't need that aeration in there.
[49:27.980 --> 49:29.440]  I don't like that shit.
[49:29.440 --> 49:32.880]  But Way2Grow was nice enough to throw in a bunch of bags
[49:32.880 --> 49:35.760]  of Fox Farms Ocean Forest Soil for free.
[49:35.760 --> 49:36.880]  They carried that shit to my car.
[49:36.880 --> 49:38.120]  And they're like, you buy a lot of shit here, bro.
[49:38.120 --> 49:38.960]  Here you go.
[49:38.960 --> 49:39.800]  These are for you.
[49:39.800 --> 49:40.920]  And I was like, fuck yeah, dude.
[49:40.920 --> 49:43.040]  I know exactly where that soil's going.
[49:43.040 --> 49:44.120]  Shout out to my friends at Way2Grow.
[49:44.120 --> 49:44.960]  They know who they are.
[49:44.960 --> 49:46.560]  I don't know if they listen to the podcast.
[49:46.560 --> 49:47.720]  If you do listen to the podcast,
[49:47.720 --> 49:48.960]  contact me because I'd love to have you
[49:48.960 --> 49:50.080]  as a sponsor on the show.
[49:50.080 --> 49:50.920]  It'd be rad.
[49:50.920 --> 49:51.760]  Yeah.
[49:51.760 --> 49:52.760]  The Rasta Jeff account.
[49:52.760 --> 49:54.840]  No, they know my account name
[49:54.840 --> 49:56.600]  and they laugh every time they hear it.
[49:56.600 --> 49:57.640]  They laugh every time
[49:57.640 --> 49:58.920]  because we've got the commercial account
[49:58.920 --> 50:01.000]  and the name of the account is really funny.
[50:01.000 --> 50:01.840]  Nice, nice.
[50:01.840 --> 50:03.680]  They know the name now.
[50:03.680 --> 50:04.520]  They already know what to type in
[50:04.520 --> 50:05.840]  when I walk up to the register.
[50:05.840 --> 50:07.800]  Oh, you told me one time.
[50:07.800 --> 50:08.640]  Yeah.
[50:08.640 --> 50:09.480]  Yeah.
[50:09.480 --> 50:10.300]  It's funny.
[50:10.300 --> 50:11.140]  It's really funny.
[50:11.140 --> 50:12.000]  All right, so you need a good fucking electrician.
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.320]  You need a way to get rid of humidity.
[50:13.320 --> 50:15.320]  You need a way to get rid of heat.
[50:15.320 --> 50:17.000]  You need plenty of air conditioning.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.240]  You gotta seal up all the cracks,
[50:18.240 --> 50:19.520]  all the nooks and crannies.
[50:19.520 --> 50:21.960]  You gotta be able to clean the fuck out of this place.
[50:21.960 --> 50:23.640]  It's gotta be a semi-clean facility.
[50:23.640 --> 50:24.960]  You don't want some old car garage
[50:24.960 --> 50:26.280]  where the floor's all greasy.
[50:26.280 --> 50:27.120]  No.
[50:27.120 --> 50:28.200]  You need a floor drain.
[50:28.200 --> 50:29.040]  Yes.
[50:29.040 --> 50:30.880]  Floor drains are crucial.
[50:30.880 --> 50:31.720]  Absolutely.
[50:31.720 --> 50:32.760]  Yeah, and water.
[50:32.760 --> 50:34.080]  You need access to water.
[50:34.080 --> 50:34.920]  Yep.
[50:34.920 --> 50:37.080]  A lot of warehouses out in Pueblo by the airport,
[50:37.080 --> 50:38.360]  they don't have water ran to them
[50:38.360 --> 50:40.120]  because they didn't need water for anything.
[50:40.120 --> 50:40.960]  Yeah, yeah, no.
[50:41.120 --> 50:43.080]  Yeah, but it's the truth.
[50:43.080 --> 50:45.840]  Yeah, so if you get one of those warehouses out there,
[50:46.920 --> 50:48.760]  sorry, just had to make sure everybody was on track here.
[50:48.760 --> 50:49.600]  Yeah.
[50:49.600 --> 50:51.200]  If you get one of those warehouses out there,
[50:51.200 --> 50:52.560]  you might not have water.
[50:52.560 --> 50:54.000]  You're gonna have to be getting trucks of water.
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.560]  You're gonna have to pay to get water out there.
[50:55.560 --> 50:57.000]  Something people aren't aware of.
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.600]  If you get a large grow on private land
[51:01.600 --> 51:04.160]  out, say, in Pueblo County somewhere,
[51:04.160 --> 51:06.760]  you have to get water rights.
[51:06.760 --> 51:08.000]  Just because you have land
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.680]  doesn't mean you're granted water rights.
[51:09.680 --> 51:11.360]  Even if there's a well there,
[51:11.360 --> 51:14.080]  you have to purchase water to offset
[51:14.080 --> 51:15.280]  what you're taking out of the aquifer.
[51:15.280 --> 51:16.240]  Exactly.
[51:16.240 --> 51:20.120]  Yep, and if there are enough grows around that area
[51:20.120 --> 51:22.320]  that that jurisdiction deems the water
[51:22.320 --> 51:23.840]  is compromised by you coming,
[51:23.840 --> 51:25.680]  they can decline your water rights.
[51:25.680 --> 51:26.960]  You can't have any water.
[51:26.960 --> 51:27.800]  Absolutely.
[51:27.800 --> 51:28.840]  Yeah.
[51:28.840 --> 51:31.080]  I mean, even to the point that they don't care
[51:31.080 --> 51:32.400]  that you're going to town to buy it
[51:32.400 --> 51:34.040]  and that you have a big truck.
[51:34.040 --> 51:35.840]  It's, sorry.
[51:35.840 --> 51:38.000]  Yeah, yeah, because you can't prove that.
[51:38.000 --> 51:39.480]  I've got a inside track
[51:39.480 --> 51:43.080]  with the Department of Natural Resources now.
[51:43.080 --> 51:44.960]  If anyone has any questions or anything,
[51:44.960 --> 51:45.800]  you can hit me up.
[51:45.800 --> 51:47.960]  There you go, message our friend, Jesse.
[51:47.960 --> 51:49.080]  We're, it's fun.
[51:49.080 --> 51:50.840]  All of the great people that we meet,
[51:50.840 --> 51:52.880]  these people would never take you and I seriously.
[51:52.880 --> 51:57.040]  Jesse's got a semi ponytail, a beard, fucking tattooed up.
[51:57.040 --> 51:58.640]  He's got, is that a trout on your arm?
[51:58.640 --> 51:59.480]  Yes.
[51:59.480 --> 52:01.200]  He's got two, I knew it was a fucking trout.
[52:01.200 --> 52:02.040]  That's so rad.
[52:02.040 --> 52:02.960]  He's got a trout on his arm.
[52:02.960 --> 52:04.080]  He's got a Colorado flag.
[52:04.080 --> 52:05.600]  He's got a chili.
[52:05.600 --> 52:06.440]  That's just one arm.
[52:06.440 --> 52:10.760]  He's got a Monarch butterfly and a snowboard.
[52:10.760 --> 52:12.120]  Yeah, man, that's his one arm.
[52:12.120 --> 52:13.040]  He's tatted up.
[52:13.040 --> 52:13.920]  And I bet a lot of the,
[52:13.920 --> 52:16.760]  and I'm six five with dreadlocks and red eyes.
[52:16.760 --> 52:19.280]  Like it's pretty much a good, and a crooked hat.
[52:19.280 --> 52:20.120]  Yeah.
[52:20.120 --> 52:21.480]  And I just wear Dickies every day
[52:21.480 --> 52:22.840]  because I destroy clothes
[52:22.840 --> 52:24.000]  and it's easier just to wear Dickies
[52:24.000 --> 52:25.040]  that are indestructible.
[52:25.040 --> 52:27.240]  And these contractors and business folks
[52:27.240 --> 52:29.040]  would never have taken us seriously
[52:29.040 --> 52:30.280]  before the scantiness industry.
[52:30.280 --> 52:31.960]  And I find it so funny.
[52:31.960 --> 52:34.280]  I've noticed when I go to restaurants in Denver
[52:34.280 --> 52:36.600]  and I'm wearing like a, just a dad kid shirt,
[52:36.600 --> 52:39.040]  basically my Irish shirt and my hat crooked
[52:39.040 --> 52:41.560]  and a pendee and skate shoes and my Dickies.
[52:41.560 --> 52:43.080]  And I walk in red eyed.
[52:43.080 --> 52:45.600]  Before restaurants would kind of be a dick to me.
[52:45.600 --> 52:47.520]  They'd kind of be like, oh, this guy's here.
[52:47.520 --> 52:49.040]  Like he's fucking up our vibe.
[52:49.040 --> 52:51.040]  But now there's always some young hip waitress.
[52:51.040 --> 52:52.840]  It's like, what's up guys that work in the weed industry.
[52:52.840 --> 52:54.200]  You're going to tip the fuck out of me.
[52:54.200 --> 52:55.760]  You want some great service, honey?
[52:55.760 --> 52:57.320]  They're Wook rich.
[52:57.320 --> 52:58.440]  Yeah, completely.
[52:58.440 --> 52:59.320]  Yep.
[52:59.320 --> 53:00.880]  I don't want fancy things.
[53:00.880 --> 53:03.960]  I want a nice, some good hash and just to live comfortably.
[53:04.640 --> 53:05.720]  I want to go to a lot of good shows.
[53:05.720 --> 53:07.400]  I'm going to go see the dead whenever they come around.
[53:07.400 --> 53:09.360]  I'm going to go see fish every time they're around.
[53:09.360 --> 53:10.720]  Do you check out the dead company?
[53:10.720 --> 53:13.560]  I saw the dead and co and it was fucking rad.
[53:13.560 --> 53:14.640]  This most recent one.
[53:14.640 --> 53:15.480]  Yeah.
[53:15.480 --> 53:16.320]  This one.
[53:16.320 --> 53:17.160]  Yeah.
[53:17.160 --> 53:18.000]  Just this recent one when they're in Boulder
[53:18.000 --> 53:18.840]  at Folsom field.
[53:18.840 --> 53:19.680]  Nice.
[53:19.680 --> 53:20.760]  Super awesome.
[53:20.760 --> 53:22.760]  I got to see one of these shows.
[53:22.760 --> 53:23.600]  One of these days.
[53:23.600 --> 53:24.440]  Yeah.
[53:24.440 --> 53:25.260]  You have to.
[53:25.260 --> 53:26.100]  Yeah.
[53:26.100 --> 53:26.940]  Come with me one time.
[53:26.940 --> 53:27.760]  Yeah.
[53:27.760 --> 53:28.600]  Yeah.
[53:28.600 --> 53:29.440]  You'll have a good time.
[53:29.440 --> 53:30.280]  I used to, I used to eat a bunch of psychedelic drugs
[53:30.280 --> 53:31.120]  when I used to go to those shows and I've quit doing that.
[53:31.120 --> 53:31.960]  I had a head injury.
[53:31.960 --> 53:33.280]  I've been listening to the podcast for a long time.
[53:33.280 --> 53:34.600]  I heard about the head injury.
[53:34.600 --> 53:38.400]  It's been a year and a half and I still have effects
[53:38.400 --> 53:39.240]  from it.
[53:39.240 --> 53:41.280]  Like I hate to admit it and talk about it,
[53:41.280 --> 53:43.560]  but I still have like TBI.
[53:43.560 --> 53:45.120]  I've got post concussion syndrome
[53:45.120 --> 53:47.120]  and I've got a traumatic brain injury still.
[53:47.120 --> 53:51.320]  I had, I played high school football very competitively.
[53:51.320 --> 53:54.120]  I had major concussions in high school
[53:54.120 --> 53:56.440]  and I know I didn't let them heal up correctly.
[53:56.440 --> 53:57.280]  Right.
[53:57.280 --> 54:00.320]  And I wonder sometimes how that affects me.
[54:00.320 --> 54:01.920]  You ever, you ever doing shit and you go,
[54:02.760 --> 54:03.800]  Oh, that's from that time I hit my head.
[54:03.800 --> 54:05.960]  You ever have those moments?
[54:05.960 --> 54:08.560]  I have those moments where I wonder if that's, you know.
[54:08.560 --> 54:09.760]  I just blame it on that anyway.
[54:09.760 --> 54:13.680]  I'm like, yep, that's, that's from the time I smacked myself
[54:13.680 --> 54:15.720]  right now when I'm reaching to the left for no reason
[54:15.720 --> 54:17.480]  and my jacket's to the right.
[54:17.480 --> 54:20.480]  That is why, that's from the time I smacked my fucking head.
[54:21.560 --> 54:22.400]  All right.
[54:22.400 --> 54:23.600]  Let's try to get back on track.
[54:23.600 --> 54:24.800]  I don't even know where the fuck we were.
[54:24.800 --> 54:27.480]  Talking about concussions and building grows.
[54:27.480 --> 54:28.400]  Large facility.
[54:28.400 --> 54:29.380]  Large facilities.
[54:29.380 --> 54:30.220]  Yeah.
[54:30.220 --> 54:31.200]  Have a first aid kit.
[54:31.800 --> 54:33.320]  Talking about needing water.
[54:33.320 --> 54:34.320]  Oh, yeah.
[54:34.320 --> 54:36.120]  Water tanks, water filtration.
[54:37.480 --> 54:38.880]  Your average on the shelf,
[54:38.880 --> 54:42.040]  grow store water filter can't handle the amount of water.
[54:42.040 --> 54:43.840]  No, you need a lot of water.
[54:43.840 --> 54:48.040]  I use a thousand gallons of water every 48 hours to grow.
[54:48.040 --> 54:50.600]  And that's 105 lights total.
[54:50.600 --> 54:55.600]  I'm doing 155 to 165 right now.
[54:55.800 --> 54:58.040]  Sea burst still not even at full capacity.
[54:58.040 --> 54:59.880]  Yeah, I'm in full flower.
[54:59.880 --> 55:01.440]  I've got plants that are five feet tall
[55:01.440 --> 55:03.960]  with big fucking donkey dick buds on them.
[55:03.960 --> 55:08.480]  Either way, that's still a lot more than your basement grow.
[55:08.480 --> 55:09.400]  Oh, so much more.
[55:09.400 --> 55:10.240]  Yeah.
[55:10.240 --> 55:11.960]  If you're using, I figure you use about indoors,
[55:11.960 --> 55:14.560]  you probably use five gallons of water per light
[55:14.560 --> 55:17.260]  every 48 to 72 hours-ish.
[55:18.840 --> 55:20.440]  Yeah, for the most part.
[55:20.440 --> 55:21.280]  That's the way I used to.
[55:21.280 --> 55:22.560]  So if you guys are trying to figure out how much water
[55:22.560 --> 55:24.140]  you should be using in your indoor,
[55:24.140 --> 55:27.640]  every 1000 watt or 600 watt light, 600 to 1000 watt light,
[55:27.640 --> 55:28.920]  you should be running about five gallons
[55:28.920 --> 55:30.380]  every 24 to 48 hours.
[55:30.380 --> 55:32.080]  If your temperatures and your humidity and everything
[55:32.080 --> 55:34.960]  are dialed in and your plants are at their optimum growth,
[55:34.960 --> 55:36.160]  your plants are growing a little slow,
[55:36.160 --> 55:37.800]  you're probably overwatering them.
[55:39.400 --> 55:40.520]  I would agree.
[55:40.520 --> 55:41.720]  Yeah, that's usually the first sign
[55:41.720 --> 55:43.040]  of overwatering some plants.
[55:43.040 --> 55:47.000]  Outdoors, it's gonna be average,
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.600]  I'd say five gallons of plant.
[55:48.600 --> 55:49.440]  Per plant?
[55:49.440 --> 55:50.260]  Per day.
[55:50.260 --> 55:51.100]  Per day?
[55:52.160 --> 55:53.480]  You don't want to get super hot.
[55:53.480 --> 55:55.040]  Is it okay to just turn on the hose
[55:55.040 --> 55:56.640]  and just let the hose just fucking flood
[55:56.640 --> 55:57.880]  those outdoor plants?
[56:00.560 --> 56:02.680]  Yes, for the most part.
[56:04.360 --> 56:06.600]  I try to concentrate it more just around the plant
[56:06.600 --> 56:08.440]  because I feel like it's wasting.
[56:08.440 --> 56:09.260]  Okay, yeah.
[56:09.260 --> 56:10.100]  Just to conserve it more.
[56:10.100 --> 56:10.920]  Yeah, okay.
[56:10.920 --> 56:11.760]  But yeah, no, you could totally do
[56:11.760 --> 56:14.720]  like field flood irrigation.
[56:14.720 --> 56:18.240]  I actually know of a wholesale place here in Pueblo County
[56:18.240 --> 56:22.240]  that floods their field just like they do with cantaloupe
[56:22.240 --> 56:24.240]  or watermelon or anything.
[56:24.240 --> 56:25.080]  Wow.
[56:25.080 --> 56:25.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[56:25.940 --> 56:27.100]  So they just fill that, let it soak,
[56:27.100 --> 56:28.380]  and then let it dry and reflood it?
[56:28.380 --> 56:30.380]  They're just doing a flood and drain outdoor?
[56:30.380 --> 56:31.420]  Basically, yeah.
[56:31.420 --> 56:32.260]  Okay.
[56:33.180 --> 56:34.860]  I think they do it like two or three times a season.
[56:34.860 --> 56:37.240]  I need to go explore and visit more
[56:37.240 --> 56:39.460]  of these outdoor cannabis and hemp grows.
[56:39.460 --> 56:41.340]  I want to see how you guys are doing a lot of this shit.
[56:41.340 --> 56:42.580]  I want to learn from your tech.
[56:42.580 --> 56:44.980]  I want to see what I can implement into my indoor tech.
[56:44.980 --> 56:46.340]  I could show you a couple cool ones.
[56:46.340 --> 56:48.740]  Yeah, I'd love to see a bunch of big stuff.
[56:48.740 --> 56:51.820]  The something I think's pretty cool,
[56:51.820 --> 56:55.220]  the overwhelming majority of these places
[56:55.220 --> 56:57.580]  are no-till raised bed.
[56:57.580 --> 56:58.420]  Oh, neat.
[56:58.420 --> 56:59.260]  Yeah.
[56:59.260 --> 57:00.080]  So no-till, you guys,
[57:01.460 --> 57:05.080]  they make an amended soil with a lot of special amendments
[57:05.080 --> 57:07.260]  and then very specific amendments
[57:07.260 --> 57:08.300]  that I'm ignorant to, honestly.
[57:08.300 --> 57:09.660]  I don't know what goes into that.
[57:09.660 --> 57:12.300]  A lot of life.
[57:12.300 --> 57:13.140]  Okay.
[57:13.140 --> 57:17.140]  Yeah, it's beneficial nights, beneficial castings.
[57:17.140 --> 57:18.140]  Live worms?
[57:18.140 --> 57:18.980]  Live worms, yeah.
[57:18.980 --> 57:19.800]  Okay.
[57:19.800 --> 57:21.420]  So it's living soil, you guys.
[57:21.420 --> 57:22.260]  Yeah.
[57:22.260 --> 57:24.180]  And the plants are harvested.
[57:24.180 --> 57:25.580]  And do you pull out the big root ball
[57:25.580 --> 57:26.780]  or do you just leave that in there?
[57:26.780 --> 57:29.780]  You pull out the stem around it.
[57:29.780 --> 57:30.620]  Okay.
[57:30.620 --> 57:32.580]  You actually want to leave as much of the root ball
[57:32.580 --> 57:33.420]  in there as you can
[57:33.420 --> 57:34.540]  because the worms are going to eat it,
[57:34.540 --> 57:37.180]  turn it back into nutrients for the plant again.
[57:37.180 --> 57:38.940]  Life going in circles.
[57:38.940 --> 57:41.340]  You pull the plant out and you put a new one in
[57:41.340 --> 57:43.040]  and you send her off again.
[57:44.940 --> 57:47.460]  They use a lot of cover crops and stuff like that in them.
[57:47.460 --> 57:49.900]  Okay, so you're stacking stuff into the pot
[57:49.900 --> 57:52.860]  and then the worms will eat all of that mostly.
[57:52.860 --> 57:55.300]  That stuff will decompose and become plant.
[57:55.300 --> 57:57.100]  And then so you're going to start losing a little bit
[57:57.100 --> 57:58.520]  of depth every time, right?
[57:58.520 --> 58:00.780]  That's the depth of the soil is going to move down
[58:00.780 --> 58:02.540]  and then you can just refill it with your fresh top.
[58:02.540 --> 58:04.580]  That's how you recharge no-tills.
[58:04.580 --> 58:05.420]  That's awesome.
[58:05.420 --> 58:08.780]  You go back and top dress in all your recharged amendments.
[58:08.780 --> 58:09.660]  That's pretty awesome.
[58:09.660 --> 58:10.500]  I never thought of that.
[58:10.500 --> 58:11.320]  Recharge your cover crop.
[58:11.320 --> 58:15.180]  It's extremely economical.
[58:15.180 --> 58:17.060]  That's why most of these places are running it.
[58:17.060 --> 58:19.580]  And they're such large scale that it's just.
[58:19.580 --> 58:20.660]  Do the plants taste good?
[58:21.420 --> 58:24.380]  Being an indoor grower who uses mainly bottled nutrients
[58:24.380 --> 58:25.460]  for most of my grow career,
[58:25.460 --> 58:27.660]  I've always been taught to flush my plants.
[58:29.420 --> 58:30.300]  Are they those guys that say,
[58:30.300 --> 58:31.140]  I don't need to flush
[58:31.140 --> 58:33.100]  because I've been flushing the whole time.
[58:33.100 --> 58:34.180]  Is that those guys?
[58:34.180 --> 58:35.820]  Okay, so since they're not feeding
[58:35.820 --> 58:37.140]  a whole bunch of bottled nutrients,
[58:37.140 --> 58:38.540]  a bunch of chelated salts,
[58:38.540 --> 58:40.080]  their plants aren't backed up with stuff.
[58:40.080 --> 58:42.020]  Their plants are probably more able to,
[58:43.220 --> 58:45.460]  I can't even remember the word right now.
[58:45.460 --> 58:48.460]  Assimilate all of the nutrients that are going through.
[58:48.460 --> 58:49.660]  They can use it a little bit better.
[58:49.660 --> 58:50.660]  It comes up and goes down.
[58:50.660 --> 58:51.780]  They get rid of it a little more.
[58:51.780 --> 58:52.620]  Okay.
[58:52.620 --> 58:53.440]  Kind of buffet style.
[58:53.440 --> 58:54.280]  They get to pick and choose.
[58:54.280 --> 58:55.980]  Yeah, instead of just being force fed.
[58:55.980 --> 58:56.980]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[58:56.980 --> 58:58.760]  The plants actually finish themselves off.
[58:58.760 --> 59:02.460]  They start fading just like they would if they're flooded.
[59:02.460 --> 59:03.340]  I mean flushed.
[59:03.340 --> 59:04.180]  So they know.
[59:04.180 --> 59:06.100]  They're just like, hey, my season's done.
[59:07.980 --> 59:10.580]  Do you see a difference in specific strains?
[59:10.580 --> 59:12.700]  Does strain A versus strain B,
[59:12.700 --> 59:15.140]  do they finish differently in the no-till outdoor?
[59:15.140 --> 59:17.900]  I haven't done enough of it to say that.
[59:17.900 --> 59:20.340]  I was just curious if that was nutrients running out
[59:20.340 --> 59:22.140]  or if that was actually the plant realizing,
[59:22.140 --> 59:23.940]  hey, I'm done, I'm flushing myself.
[59:25.860 --> 59:27.620]  I know in my experience,
[59:28.580 --> 59:29.860]  the way I grow in the grounds,
[59:29.860 --> 59:31.940]  kind of no-till pretty much.
[59:31.940 --> 59:34.020]  I know Girl Scout Cookies and Flo
[59:34.020 --> 59:36.700]  will finish themselves off without a doubt.
[59:36.700 --> 59:38.260]  The Forum Cut Girl Scout Cookies.
[59:38.260 --> 59:40.220]  Flo will finish herself off, you guys.
[59:40.220 --> 59:42.220]  If you ever want me to.
[59:44.580 --> 59:45.820]  All right, we've been going for about an hour.
[59:45.820 --> 59:47.060]  Let's start wrapping it up
[59:47.100 --> 59:49.500]  because I'm actually expecting dinner to show up
[59:49.500 --> 59:50.740]  in the next 20 or 30 minutes.
[59:50.740 --> 59:53.460]  I just started thinking about that about 15 minutes ago too.
[59:53.460 --> 59:54.980]  I saw you messing with your phone.
[59:54.980 --> 59:57.060]  I was like, he's dealing with his dinner.
[59:57.060 --> 59:59.100]  That's exactly what that was.
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.180]  It was, hey, I'll be there in 15.
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.540]  And I said, give us 30.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.540]  I actually got to go foliar spray some plants
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.380]  when I'm leaving here too.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.420]  What are you going to spray?
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.460]  Essential oils.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.300]  Oh, okay.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.540]  So pesticide, pest management,
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.660]  integrated pest management with essential oils.
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:16.540]  We are to 13 days into flower.
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.060]  Nice.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:21.020]  Just about the end of that spray period right now.
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.420]  And the lights just shut off.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.940]  So I'm going to go hit them with it a few more times.
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.220]  And get in there with that green light.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.060]  Yeah.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.140]  Do you wear the forehead green light
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:30.980]  or do you have a room light?
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.380]  No, I got the forehead one.
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.140]  I don't like the full room ones.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:34.980]  Okay.
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.140]  Inevitably that light switch always gets left on.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:37.980]  Right.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.140]  And you don't notice it when all the other lights are on.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.780]  Right, so you're just running that green light
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.620]  for nothing all day.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.460]  Yeah.
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:44.900]  A little CFL.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.060]  I like the green light on my head
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.380]  because then it's looking where I'm looking.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:48.220]  Yeah.
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:49.220]  Yeah, it's actually focused where I am.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.420]  Instead of just, then you don't get shadows.
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.340]  Hey, good point.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.820]  Yeah, then I shadow myself.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:54.780]  I got dreadlocks.
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:57.100]  If the light's from behind, I don't see shit.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.500]  All right, we've talked a lot about building,
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.140]  getting your large commercial grow going.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.460]  Do you have any things that you want to add
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.540]  before we start wrapping this up
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.500]  so that I don't cut off any of your useful data
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.620]  for our listeners?
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:12.220]  Find a person that can be vouched for by many people
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:15.900]  throughout the community to work with your engineer,
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.940]  to help design your building,
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.540]  and pay him what he is worth.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.980]  It'll be a guy like me or Jeff.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.740]  And even if he's not gonna grow for you,
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.460]  pay him what it's worth.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:33.180]  And your end product will drastically improve
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:35.100]  and work better by doing that.
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.380]  In my first week at Green and Healthy Wellness,
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:43.380]  I made minor improvements that improved the financial,
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.340]  it just made sense.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.820]  I fixed their books a little bit
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.460]  just by fucking doing a couple of adjustments,
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.500]  like making the garden more profitable
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.740]  just by eliminating this and adding this.
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.620]  It just took me a week
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.900]  to make a whole bunch of small improvements,
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:58.500]  just because the person who set it up and was running it
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.380]  was not an experienced grower, was not...
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:04.540]  I don't want to bash this person,
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:05.860]  but they weren't a forward thinker.
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:08.780]  They didn't look far enough into the future.
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.300]  They didn't have foresight to realize
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:11.260]  that if I don't put glue here,
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.900]  the shit's gonna come apart eventually.
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:17.100]  Yeah, so I fixed a lot of just small details.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.460]  They didn't have any heaters in the...
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.540]  So it was winter when I started,
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.900]  there were no heaters in the reservoirs
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:23.500]  and they're feeding the plants 54 degree water
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.460]  and they couldn't get the pH
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.660]  of the fucking water to come up.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.580]  They're just pouring in pH,
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.820]  they couldn't get it to go down.
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.860]  They're just pouring in like a half a gallon of pH down
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.700]  and like it won't move.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.620]  And I was like, stuck my hand in.
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.100]  Yeah, and I stuck my hand in there
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.180]  and I was like, oh my God.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.380]  And they go, put your hand in there, bro.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.540]  I go, where does the water come from?
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:39.580]  He goes, the hose.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:40.900]  I was like, oh, so municipal water.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.100]  It's coming from the fucking line.
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.420]  It's underground and it's 30 degrees outside.
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.180]  So I stuck a thermometer in there
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.100]  and that water was 54 degrees.
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.500]  I was like, well, that's why the pH won't move
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.940]  and that's why the plants have the claw.
[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.420]  They all had the fucking downward claw,
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.640]  but the plants were purple.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.660]  Like everything was purple.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.660]  They were happy about that.
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:59.340]  But so I put aquarium heaters in there.
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.380]  I was like, let's go to the fish store
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.960]  and get the biggest aquarium heaters they have,
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:02.820]  put two in each one,
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.980]  set them at 74 degrees and let them run.
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.420]  Do you get the glass ones or like the stainless steels?
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.900]  The glass ones, they work beautifully.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:13.260]  Then I learned that they sell big R cells.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.100]  They're for heating animal like horse trough tanks.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.820]  Yeah, it's stock tank heaters.
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.380]  Those would have been more economical,
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.800]  but I didn't think of that because I'm not a farm boy.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.700]  I just never thought of that.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:23.620]  For sure.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.020]  I ordered in a couple at the store last winter.
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:26.860]  Nice.
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:28.380]  We've been selling the glass ones
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.420]  and I found the stainless steel ones
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.260]  and they sold them up very quickly.
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.060]  Yeah, I'm afraid that that glass one's gonna break
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:37.140]  and they're on accident somehow.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:37.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.740]  It's in 1,000 gallons, it's in 250 gallons of water.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:45.140]  Someday it will, but yeah, they fell safe though.
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.300]  So you're not gonna get shocked.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.980]  Right, yeah, they're not in there right now.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.580]  So it's summertime.
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.880]  So I took those mother fuckers out, but yeah.
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.700]  You guys, a lot of the shit you're gonna go spend money on
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.940]  at the hydro store, go check out the aquarium store
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:59.340]  before you do that because it's cheaper.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.020]  Or even Granger, to be totally honest.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.820]  Oh yeah, you don't always have to buy all your stuff.
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.860]  Big R has a lot of very useful shit.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:08.540]  The normal growth store, not the hydroponic store,
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:12.380]  but like the local garden supply center has a lot of shit.
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:15.380]  Home Depot and Lowe's and Target have a lot of good shit.
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:18.300]  Just do not buy nutrients, soil,
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:21.040]  anything that is going to be consumed by you or your plant,
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.540]  don't purchase that at Home Depot, Lowe's or Target.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:26.300]  Only accessories made out of plastic or whatever.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:27.240]  That kind of shit.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.340]  Lighting, that's kind of growth store specific
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.220]  still at this point.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:34.420]  Hobby Lobby sells Fisker scissors for $12.99
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:38.500]  as opposed to Home Depot and everywhere else is $19.99.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.940]  The little titanium tip Fisker's trim scissors.
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:45.460]  I think I do them cheaper than that, but I'm not sure.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.380]  Okay, oh at Hygro?
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.220]  Yeah.
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:49.580]  If they're $9.99, we'll go get them.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.820]  One Love, sorry, forget that you guys changed names.
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:54.180]  All that shit.
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.820]  I can't, I'm not as involved with the store anymore
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.700]  as I was, so.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.900]  Is that the wife now?
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.380]  Oh yeah, it's always been the wife.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:01.940]  Shout out to the wife.
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.140]  Yeah, that's her baby.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.780]  Nice, she does a good job.
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:07.660]  I'm just in Springs.
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:09.460]  If I were there, I'd shop there,
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:11.860]  but I'm right up the street from the store in Springs
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:14.660]  that has, if I needed 14 bags of soil,
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.900]  I don't know that you'd have it.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.860]  Nowadays we probably would.
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.660]  Yeah, no, I understand.
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:22.100]  Yeah, trust me.
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.420]  Commercial orders are a little,
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.780]  that's something we should mention, commercial ordering.
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.620]  Yeah, huh.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.380]  Good luck the first time you want to figure out
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:30.760]  how much fucking soil you need to fill all those pots
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.160]  because that's a math challenge.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.920]  You heard Jesse and I sit here and try to figure out
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.200]  how much soil we needed.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.200]  You're gonna have to go back to the store a couple times.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.440]  Don't expect all stores,
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.000]  you gotta be able to get commercial quantities of things
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:44.840]  when you need them.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.440]  You need to think ahead about stuff.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.280]  Yeah, you might have to start letting,
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.280]  we let the store near us know that this is,
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.040]  these are products that we use on the regular.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.100]  If you keep these stocked, we'll buy them.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.320]  If we come here and you don't have it,
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.800]  we will drive directly to another store and get it
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.640]  because we don't fuck around.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:00.480]  And we're going to your competition.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.040]  And so it took them a couple of rhythms, you know,
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.400]  it took them a couple, hey, you don't have it.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.600]  And like, it's coming Wednesday, the trucks come Wednesday.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.440]  I don't care.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.800]  And so what we kind of a job, we compromise with the,
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.680]  we can't fuck with the day the trucks run.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.600]  Like that's some shit we can't ask for.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.000]  Like, we'll get it on your next order.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.080]  It doesn't fit.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.800]  Like, you know, like bring it on the previous order.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.680]  You guys are ordering a truckload of shit.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.440]  Like it's a truck of your stuff.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.720]  It's funny, the, there's two main truckers
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.720]  that they literally move, I would say,
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.720]  60 to 70% of the gross stores or gross supplies
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.320]  sold in gross stores all across Colorado.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.160]  That's awesome.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.160]  Or all up and down the front range.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.040]  That's awesome.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.240]  Gary and James.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.840]  Because there's probably one warehouse
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.040]  that gets fucking everything.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:44.880]  There's three main warehouses in Denver.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.280]  And then it just gets distributed from there
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.480]  out to Pueblo Springs, Denver.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.040]  A company named Denver Air is one of the only
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.080]  delivery companies that will work from Denver South
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.240]  on a daily route.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.080]  Oh wow.
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.000]  They go to Way to Grow.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.280]  They go to us.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.400]  They go to Grow Generation.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.480]  They go to all of them.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:02.320]  All of them.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.160]  Yeah.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.000]  Way to Grow is my favorite.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.800]  If you're going big, if you're going big stuff.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.160]  If you're in Pueblo and you want to buy stuff
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:10.120]  for your small grow, definitely hit One Love.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.600]  And if you're big, huge, gigantic county greenhouse grow,
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.640]  we already deal with a handful,
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.040]  half a dozen clients out there.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.800]  We know what it takes to service big grills like that.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.880]  So if you're in Pueblo and you're out there in the county,
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.720]  go hit them up.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.800]  I didn't know if they were able to handle that.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.640]  Go see them.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.120]  They'll take care of you.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:29.960]  They'll get you a commercial account going.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.800]  Drop shipping.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.640]  Yeah.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.520]  You just have to semi pull up to your farm.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.360]  Beep, beep.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.680]  Just drop off loads of soil.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.040]  Oh yeah.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:38.880]  It's nice.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.720]  It's so much fun.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.840]  Watching people carry all your shit in for you.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.200]  Like Jesse said, he said to hire somebody
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.760]  that knows what the fuck they're talking about
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.400]  when it comes to working with your engineer
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.560]  to build to grow.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.120]  Something super important that just sounds egotistical
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.320]  coming from myself and Jesse,
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:55.320]  but also hire a master grower that is a master grower.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.600]  Interview people.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.960]  Look at pictures of plants they've grown.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.040]  I brought people to my home grow
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.800]  to show them that I can grow on a commercial scale.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.160]  I was like, here is what I can do.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.880]  If you put me in a big grow, I can do it.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.840]  And they trusted me and they gave me the opportunity
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.920]  by seeing the cleanliness and the organization
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.880]  of my home grow.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.200]  I did the same thing.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.040]  Yeah.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.040]  So if you can go look at their grow
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.600]  before you hire a master grower, do it.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.640]  And if you're the business guy
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.880]  and you think you're gonna grow it yourself
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.000]  and be professional, you're gonna fuck it up.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.080]  I've got faith in your skills.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.040]  I've got faith in your mind,
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.520]  but cannabis is something that takes a lot of practice
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.360]  to learn.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.480]  It's like playing an instrument.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.120]  You might have natural skill,
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.520]  but you're not gonna be Bon Jovi the first time you grow.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.880]  You're gonna have to fucking practice.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.120]  You're gonna have to tour a few times.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:37.960]  You're gonna have to do it.
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.560]  You're gonna have to have 10 cycles under your belt
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.840]  before you even think about going big.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.000]  Oh yeah, easily.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.800]  Full cycles from clone all the way to drying and curing
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.480]  all the way to moving the packs.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.880]  There's a lot to figure out.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.520]  My boss gets, or my head owner,
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.760]  he gets down and dirty in the grow room.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:03.200]  And he has this child excitement about it.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.520]  It's so fucking awesome.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.920]  I've never, well I know Hunt,
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.640]  he gets down in the grow room too.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.120]  Hunt packs lots for me.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.000]  I'll show, Hunt comes in at six in the morning
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.760]  on certain, on Tuesdays.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.080]  Hunt will be there at six in the morning
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.440]  and I'll come in a couple few hours later
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.600]  and he'll have a hundred pots filled with soil
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.080]  being like, hey, you can get all those transplants done
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.240]  today, I got you a headstart.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.080]  Nice.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.400]  And I'm like, hell yeah, bro.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.760]  And he sweeps, he sweeps the entire facility
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.080]  if I need him to.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:28.920]  So does my guy.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.240]  He takes out trash.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.200]  Like he's like, bro, you're not here to take out trash.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.080]  You're here to grow cannabis.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.160]  Go grow cannabis for me.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.240]  Yeah, it's below your pay grade.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.720]  That's what I get told a lot.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:38.800]  Yeah, it doesn't feel fair.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.360]  Like I'm not too good to clean the shitters
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.600]  and take out trash, but you're right.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.960]  I should be hands on with the plant.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.840]  It feels good though to have, to work for people
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.000]  that realize you don't wanna do that stuff.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.840]  That you would do it, but you don't want to.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.720]  And it feels good for them to tell you
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.960]  that you don't have to worry about that.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.200]  I enjoy that part of it.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.440]  A lot of the time I get the giant facility all to myself.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.840]  So I just put on headphones and yeah,
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.640]  which makes me feel like sometimes
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.520]  I gotta clean the shitters.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.560]  I gotta sweep the floors.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.560]  I don't mind doing it.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.400]  For sure.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.680]  And if I go take a shit, I clean the shitter
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.520]  when I'm done just because I don't wanna be that guy
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.360]  leaving a hot seat and some streaks for the next guy.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.280]  That's like rinsing your plate as soon as you're done eating.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.560]  Fucking some Windex right there.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.720]  Just hose that bitch down and clean it up.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:25.120]  For people that don't know much about the industry
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.880]  or don't live in Colorado, it is not common at all
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:32.360]  to find owners that are actually involved in the grow.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.320]  I think me and Jeff are both fortunate to work for people.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.480]  Unfortunately it's equally as common to find rich dudes
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.600]  that own Porsche dealerships
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.860]  that wanna double their fucking money
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.120]  by opening a dispensary and being a dickhead to everybody
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.840]  and don't know anything about cannabis.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.680]  Oh yeah, there's a few of those.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:45.720]  There's a few of those.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.880]  Yeah, very similar stories.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.720]  Yeah.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.000]  There's a bunch of guys that just wanna double up
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  because they have a little bit of money.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.040]  That's where my talk about hire a real master grower
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.040]  loops around.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.520]  A lot of people wanna hire their cousin
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.200]  because they wanna give their cousin a job
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.640]  or their nephew or their fucking brother-in-law
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.000]  because he grew weed in the 70s.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.240]  And he talks a good game.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.300]  This is your investment.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.640]  It's gonna cost you a million bucks
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.920]  to get your grow and your dispensary going.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.740]  Easily.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:16.600]  It's 600,000 to get started
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.960]  and then you need another 400 for some payroll
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.400]  and whatever pops up
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.400]  and you're gonna need a lawyer and an accountant.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.640]  It's a million bucks.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:25.720]  Basically a million dollars.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.800]  Yeah, just for a small, small facility.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.280]  Even our little facility, man.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.120]  Yeah.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.880]  So unless you trust your fucking cousin
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.240]  a million bucks worth,
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.240]  your future is on the line,
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.280]  your business is on the line,
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.520]  your grow is on the line.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.840]  Some of us growers are weird people.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.000]  We've been taught to hide this for so many years.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.320]  The guys that are good at it did it
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.800]  like when we were hiding it
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.320]  and we were kind of sketchy about it.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.180]  So sometimes some of our background history
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.960]  on the application is a little vague.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.120]  Sometimes we've got a big furry ass beard
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.800]  that could have squirrels hiding in it.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.740]  Sometimes you got dreadlocks down to your ass
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.720]  that could have the whole damn zoo hiding in it.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.320]  They don't, we don't like sharing secrets.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.320]  We don't like to share too many secrets.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.680]  We've been ripped off before.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.440]  We've been fucked over before.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.280]  So hard.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.460]  By dispensary owners, by street people,
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.720]  by friends, by family.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:13.560]  Things have gone wrong.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.120]  So we're a little protective of ourselves
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.040]  and our knowledge.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:22.600]  And it's one thing, I heard my boss say it the other day,
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.280]  growers are some of the only people in the industry
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.840]  that don't actually need a job.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.680]  Right.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.240]  They could go make their own money doing their.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.560]  I hate to say this, but I actually made more.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.760]  No, I very much need my job.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.320]  I made more money being a black market grower
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.600]  than I ever have in the legal industry.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.840]  But I don't have to look over my shoulder anymore.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.480]  I don't have to, when I hear ruffling
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.920]  outside the front door too early,
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.120]  I don't think the door's about to get kicked the fuck in
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.840]  because I spent plenty of years of my life
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.720]  just wondering is today the day they kick this fucker in?
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.160]  You can get a loan for a car.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.160]  You can get a loan for, it's hard work,
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.400]  but it can get done.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.680]  Brand new car in the driveway
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.360]  that I couldn't have done when I was a street hustler
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.400]  because now I've got paychecks and pay stubs
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.160]  and I pay taxes and yeah.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.680]  I pay child support because I've got a child
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.680]  that lives with their mom
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.200]  and just because we don't live in the same place,
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.560]  I'm required to fucking pay child support,
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.080]  which is cool with me.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.160]  Instead of just driving it over there,
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.040]  I have to go through a system,
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.920]  which documents it being paid.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.000]  They were always on my ass about my income.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:16.920]  You're paying child support,
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.480]  but we want to know where your money comes from.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.320]  And I was like, why does it matter
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.400]  if the bill gets paid?
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.520]  Yeah, I just kept telling them like,
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.960]  my mom pays it or my grandpa died, he left me money.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.720]  I just fucking told them that kind of shit.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.800]  But now I'm like, hey, look, I work at this place.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.560]  And they're like, okay, thank you.
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.520]  So having a job, not looking over my shoulder
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.440]  is well worth the difference.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.280]  And it's.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.360]  The stress reduction,
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.320]  although there's other stress that comes from it.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.160]  Right.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.120]  It's a different kind of stress, but.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.800]  But now I can be.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.360]  I am more proud of my grow now
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.920]  than I was when I was a black market grower.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.760]  For sure.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.160]  Like, it was kind of cool having that thing
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.840]  in the basement that nobody knew about.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.040]  And I would disappear for fucking 12 hours at a time.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.560]  They'd be like, where have you, what have you been doing?
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.800]  I've been trimming weed, but I can't tell you guys that.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.640]  Don't worry about it.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.040]  Yeah, I don't know, man, I didn't feel good.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.280]  I just went home and took a nap.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.400]  Yeah.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.560]  So hire yourself a master grower.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560]  We may look like weirdos.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.080]  We might be tatted up.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.160]  Get yourself somebody that's on fucking time.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.960]  Somebody that doesn't, they can drink and do some drugs.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.440]  But I've had some problems in the past
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.800]  with employees that have recently hired
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.800]  that one guy was party too hard the night before
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.520]  and was too drunk to come to work.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.440]  And then I had another guy
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.640]  that ate too many mushrooms the night before
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.120]  and tripped way too hard and had a headache
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.160]  and couldn't come to work.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.480]  Plants don't care about that.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.320]  Yeah, fuck you.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.840]  You got a job to do.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.320]  I rely on you, the plants rely on you.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.280]  If you don't show up and water those plants, they're dead.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.120]  It's a business.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.360]  Yeah, if you don't show up on time
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.280]  and get a pump diet overnight, because pumps die.
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.440]  You're fired.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.360]  The whole garden's dead.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.200]  You're fucking fired.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.520]  There goes your million dollar investment.
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.400]  So hire yourself a real master grower.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.400]  Somebody that knows what they're doing,
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.440]  not just your cousin.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.360]  We might look like weirdos.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.800]  We might be introverts,
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.400]  but if we're on time, we show initiative, we're dedicated.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.240]  You gotta be a soldier.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.920]  You gotta be dedicated to the grow.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.040]  You gotta respect the plants.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.040]  You gotta be able to build a relationship with the plants.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.920]  You need somebody you can communicate with,
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.120]  someone that can multitask,
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.480]  someone that can deal with a contractor,
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.960]  someone that's not gonna be a dick
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.440]  when the electrician shows up.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.160]  Someone that's not gonna run out the back door
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.120]  when med shows up.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.800]  Dude, you know what you do when med shows up?
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.400]  You hand them all the compliance binders
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.520]  with all your info and you tell them to have a good day.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.440]  And they get to sit there and figure out what's wrong.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.400]  And they can't come in and check
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.160]  until they tell you they need to.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.000]  Really, I didn't know that.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.600]  Yeah, yeah, just hand them those compliance binders
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.440]  and wait for them to find an issue.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:25.280]  Okay.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.120]  Yeah.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.240]  Here you go, I'm gonna go back to work.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.280]  And by the way, I'm not the owner,
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.360]  so you can't even tell me shit.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.800]  I'll call the owner.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:31.640]  Just call the owner.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.160]  Tell him, hey, med's here, I'm doing my job.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.080]  Just go back to work.
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:35.920]  Nice, nice.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.960]  All right, I feel like we've gone a long way
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.800]  in this podcast.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.640]  It's a long show, yeah.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.800]  That's cool, we're an hour and 15 minutes in,
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.880]  but there's a lot of good information.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.480]  This podcast was everything.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.120]  There was news, education, and conversation.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.680]  I'm not sure what the news was.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:51.760]  Terps.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.800]  Terps, yeah, the terps are awesome.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.640]  That's the news.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.360]  It's official, you guys, terps are awesome.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.200]  Terps on terps.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.320]  Terps all day long.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.480]  Shout out to the Terp Suite and all those kids.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.320]  I've got one more thing written down on my paper of notes
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.160]  that we need to talk about,
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.840]  and it is the Uncle Bud Company.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:07.600]  Tell me all about the Uncle Bud Company.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.600]  Uncle Bud Company is the company I'm employed by.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.600]  Is that a grow and a dispensary?
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.200]  Yes, we've got an MIP and an OPC.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.200]  That's a MIP's a license to make hash and edibles.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.800]  Medically infused products.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:21.640]  Yes.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.960]  Marijuana infused products.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:23.800]  Yeah.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.720]  We use a CO2 extraction method.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.960]  So that's primarily we make vape,
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.480]  or while we've started off,
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.760]  the companies still knew we're evolving.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:41.040]  We started off with CO2 oil,
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.040]  vape pen refills and cartridges.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:46.960]  We're bringing out a line of edibles.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.120]  We're going through testing and approval,
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.800]  which is a bit of a process right now,
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.080]  but those will be on store shelves soon.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.160]  And then we'll also be bringing,
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.640]  I don't know how I can state it.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:02.320]  We're bringing a fractional distillate product
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.440]  that's similar to a product called Clear.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.280]  Okay, all right.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.720]  To the market, and then we'll be bringing
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.640]  our version of terpenes to the rec market too.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.560]  This distillate is the new stuff.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.800]  Let me read the label on the distillate that I've got.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.240]  This is raw distillate.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.440]  This is total potential cannabinoids,
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:23.280]  94.1% THC, cannabinoids total.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.240]  And then it's broken down CBD 1.1%,
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.240]  THC 90.94% THC in this distillate.
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.920]  And it's just like that.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.520]  Yeah, it's basically the same thing.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:37.080]  You're just taking RotoVap and everything
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.200]  and pulling out the terpenoids,
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.200]  pulling out the cannabinoids
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.880]  and making them into separate products.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.240]  There's a, yeah, there's another process in there.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:46.400]  Yeah, yeah, we won't cover all of that stuff.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.680]  It involves something named after a farm animal.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.680]  All right, that was really vague.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.760]  So you said that you had edibles being tested
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:55.920]  and that would be coming out in the market.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.360]  Are those only going to be available
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:58.400]  at the Uncle Bud company,
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.840]  or are those going to be available
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.680]  at recreational and or medical shops statewide?
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.880]  We are a wholesaler.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.640]  We don't have a storefront as of yet.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.480]  I like it, I like it.
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.680]  It's so much easier that way.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:08.520]  Yes.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.720]  Our CO2 oil right now,
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:14.000]  I know here in Pueblo it's available at the spot.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.120]  It's also available at the spot in Trinidad.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.840]  Your CO2 oil that you guys made?
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.360]  Yes. Okay, cool.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.560]  So it's a recreational product.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.800]  Yes, yes, yes, sir.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.640]  Yeah.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:24.480]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.080]  The edible products we're coming up with
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.960]  at the moment, we've got a barbecue sauce
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.440]  that's going through the proving process.
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:33.280]  No shit.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.120]  And we've got-
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:34.960]  Barbecue sauce?
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.040]  Yep.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.680]  Hey, the people that own my company
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:38.920]  are from Georgia and Texas.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.360]  Some people are gonna be high as fuck.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.200]  Yeah.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.040]  This barbecue sauce is good.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.280]  Oh dude, it's so good.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.120]  It's really good.
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.440]  How many milligrams of THC per serving?
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.720]  That's part of the thing we're figuring out right now.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.560]  Okay.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.680]  But a bottle's got to be limited at 100 milligrams.
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.520]  100 mils per bottle.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:56.480]  So it's gonna be a smaller bottle.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.320]  Okay.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.400]  I think it'll be like two servings.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.160]  So 50 milligrams per serving.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.000]  All right.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:02.840]  So if you're gonna make some ribs,
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.040]  you can just squirt the whole bottle across some ribs.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.400]  Is the heat when you're cooking the ribs
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.640]  gonna fuck up my medicine?
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.360]  That's one of the things we've got to figure out.
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.200]  All right.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.800]  So yeah, there's a whole, I had no idea.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.640]  I'm a vegetarian, you guys.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:14.840]  So I'm just hypothetically talking
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.240]  about barbecue ribs over here.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:19.280]  I had no idea the proving process the state requires
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.440]  for a new style edible.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.280]  It's rigorous.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.960]  And then we're doing popcorn balls too.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.760]  Oh yeah, popcorn balls are huge.
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.400]  I had some popcorn balls that were coated in clear.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.080]  Oh, dude, that was high.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.880]  That's a part of the,
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.720]  a lot of our demand we've been getting for clear right now
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.640]  is coming from edibles manufacturers.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:38.480]  Nice.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:39.400]  Because they don't want any smell or any taste.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.800]  Right, it makes it so much easier.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.000]  And it's more viscous.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:42.920]  It's easier to work with.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.640]  It's not chunky like BHO.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.800]  It's a higher percentage.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.520]  So it's easier to work with.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.360]  Easier to redo the math and everything.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.880]  Less goes further, yeah.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.480]  I, shout out to my friends at TNT Extractions.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.280]  They gave me a 1000 milligram chocolate bar.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.920]  It was kind of like biting into,
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:19:59.760]  it tastes like,
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.960]  they told me that there's a gram and a half
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.240]  of shatter melted into that chocolate bar.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.120]  It tasted like they just took a gram and a half of shatter
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.440]  into a chocolate bar and just dropped the shatter
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.280]  directly into the chocolate bar.
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.800]  Because when I bit into it,
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.280]  it was chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, hash.
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.760]  And it was just like, oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:17.960]  And I had to chew through the hash.
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.480]  Just like, okay, chocolate again,
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.520]  chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.320]  But the hash was like, my teeth,
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.840]  you know when you take a dab and your lips get sticky?
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.960]  My teeth were like, they're making this noise
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.800]  when I pull them apart.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.000]  They'd sound like,
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.760]  when I pulled them apart, they would do that.
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.240]  I was like, damn, I'm hashy.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:37.720]  I got so high that I made a list of things to do.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:38.560]  Cause I went to work.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.760]  I ate it and went to fucking work.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.600]  Bad idea.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.720]  I made a list of shit to do.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.900]  And I would read on the list, water plants.
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:46.160]  And I'd walk to the water and turn on the hose
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:48.440]  and be like, what was I about to do?
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:49.720]  Like, was I going to water some plants?
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.240]  I'm not sure what was about to happen.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.440]  But I haven't eaten any edibles since that day.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.200]  I've been a little bit leery of edibles.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.520]  I had an incident a few weeks ago.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.280]  I heard some action at the front door.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.680]  So let's wrap up this podcast, bro.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.160]  I appreciate you for coming and doing an hour
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:02.400]  and 20 minute podcast with me.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.740]  That's awesome of you.
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.240]  Thanks to Burn for letting me borrow your husband
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.920]  for an hour and a half and taking some dabs with me.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:07.740]  That's super cool.
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:09.360]  Shout out to the Uncle Bud company.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.000]  You guys, I'm going to wrap up this podcast.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.320]  Thank you for coming, Jesse.
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.640]  Make sure you check out Jesse Grows on Instagram.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.480]  Yep.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.800]  She made it in, we don't have to go so quickly.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.000]  There's food here.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  I like that.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:20.880]  Thanks for coming, bro.
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.360]  Yeah, yeah, thanks for having me.
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.520]  You had something, one more thing to say, throw it out there.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.200]  Colorado dope podcast.com.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.040]  Make sure you check it out.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.400]  Stitcher and SoundCloud too.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.600]  We're going to get you on iTunes.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.440]  Yes.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.440]  Do you know how to do that?
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.520]  I just haven't had the time to sit down and-
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.440]  I know how to do it.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.280]  Nice, nice.
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.320]  If you need help, I will get you on there.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.160]  Sweet.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.120]  We're going to get this podcast on iTunes.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.680]  Cause iTunes is a place most people listen.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:42.280]  Stitcher is number two, iTunes is number one.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.660]  Yeah, you'll really see your like comments
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:45.500]  and shit will come in on iTunes.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.560]  At least we're not just stuck on SoundCloud now,
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.280]  which is like probably number 12 or 14.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.880]  I don't even have SoundCloud on my phone.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:56.080]  So I'd have to go through your Facebook post
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:56.920]  and then use the link.
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:58.120]  And then it was just a pain in the ass.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:58.960]  And then if I get a call,
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.000]  then I have to start the episode over and that sucked.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:01.840]  I hate that.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:02.680]  Yeah.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:05.040]  That's the only thing I use SoundCloud for
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.760]  is just to check our show.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.760]  So that's as soon as we're on stage.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.280]  Have you played with your statistics yet?
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.440]  Your metrics on Stitcher?
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.440]  No, I haven't.
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.780]  Don't get too attached to it,
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.760]  but it's fun to go look and see what your ranking is
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.080]  and shit, I love doing it.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.560]  The first night I kind of looked at it,
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.800]  but it didn't have any info.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:24.440]  Oh, you need to go at least like 60 days or something.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.280]  Yeah, word.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.560]  Well, dude, thanks for coming.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:27.600]  Yeah, thanks for having me.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.800]  Big shout out to 44 and Despicable D.
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.640]  Yes, sir.
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:32.460]  We'll get you guys on next time.
