[00:00.700 --> 00:05.180]  Hey what's up podcast world it's time for episode 362 of the grow from your
[00:05.180 --> 00:09.100]  heart podcast. This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company. If
[00:09.100 --> 00:12.900]  you need new seeds for your garden I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[00:12.900 --> 00:18.500]  Company and you can find them at dankseed.store. I like to start these
[00:18.500 --> 00:22.420]  shows off by letting you know what I'm smoking. Today I've been taking dabs of
[00:22.420 --> 00:27.620]  orange Skittles Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms. I really like this as my morning
[00:27.620 --> 00:30.660]  smoke. I'm recording earlier in the morning than I usually do and this
[00:30.660 --> 00:34.620]  orange Skittles has that orange juice orange candy sort of a taste. It's also
[00:34.620 --> 00:38.980]  got my head going pretty quickly so it's a great way to start the day. I'm smoking
[00:38.980 --> 00:43.300]  the orange Skittles Fambrosia from Apothecary Farms. The only difference
[00:43.300 --> 00:47.300]  between the Ambrosia and the Fambrosia is the Ambrosia is a one gram jar when
[00:47.300 --> 00:50.820]  they put it in the four gram jar. That's when they call it the Fambrosia. That's
[00:50.820 --> 00:55.700]  for the fam. So the orange Skittles Fambrosia the potency says 73.7%
[00:56.140 --> 01:03.460]  THC, zero CBD, total cannabinoids 84.6%. It's a great way to start the day. It's
[01:03.460 --> 01:07.260]  got an uplifting head high. It's got that amazing orange candy flavor to it and
[01:07.260 --> 01:10.660]  it's got me nice and talkative and energized so this should be a good
[01:10.660 --> 01:15.740]  podcast. This is going to be another grow lesson. In the last lesson I talked about
[01:15.740 --> 01:19.940]  clones versus seeds. Now in this episode we're going to talk about regular seeds,
[01:19.940 --> 01:24.980]  feminized seeds, and auto flower seeds. Before we get into the seed talk I want
[01:24.980 --> 01:28.500]  to give a few shout outs to a couple of our Patreon supporters. I want to give a
[01:28.500 --> 01:33.820]  huge shout out to Angel Burtis. How about a big shout out to Miles Porter. A super
[01:33.820 --> 01:39.260]  shout out to Jade and an extra Viking shout out to Grimble the Druid. Thank you
[01:39.260 --> 01:42.580]  ladies and gentlemen for all the support on Patreon. If you're not already a
[01:42.580 --> 01:46.060]  patron and you would like to learn how to become a patron you can do so by

[01:57.460 --> 02:02.220]  I will give you a shout out on the next episode. Alright podcast world this
[02:02.220 --> 02:06.980]  episode is going to be about regular seed, feminized seed, and auto flower seed
[02:06.980 --> 02:11.620]  and deciding what will be best for you and your new garden. A lot of people out
[02:11.620 --> 02:15.220]  there will have an opinion about feminized seeds. A lot of people out there
[02:15.220 --> 02:20.020]  will have an opinion about auto flower seeds. Don't let anybody stop you from
[02:20.020 --> 02:24.780]  growing what makes you happy. There's a reason why regular seeds exist. There's a
[02:24.780 --> 02:29.820]  reason why feminized seeds exist. There is a reason why auto flower seeds exist.
[02:29.820 --> 02:34.620]  There are applications for all of those types of seeds. Do what you love and
[02:34.620 --> 02:39.220]  don't let anybody out there stop you from growing from your heart. When we are
[02:39.220 --> 02:43.540]  shopping for seeds we are thrown a lot of information. Some of it is very
[02:43.540 --> 02:47.660]  useful, some of it is just fluff for advertising. Somewhere in that
[02:47.700 --> 02:51.740]  information we should be able to tell if the seeds we are shopping for are
[02:51.740 --> 02:57.420]  regular, feminized, or auto flowering. That should be clearly noted somewhere in
[02:57.420 --> 03:02.380]  the description. If I don't see any sort of notation I generally assume they are
[03:02.380 --> 03:06.300]  regular seeds. Now that's a really good place to start. What do I mean by regular
[03:06.300 --> 03:10.860]  seed? By regular seed I mean they were produced conventionally. They were made
[03:10.860 --> 03:15.300]  with a male plant and a female plant. So in that package of seeds you will find
[03:15.620 --> 03:20.940]  males and females. They are also not auto flower which means they are photo period.
[03:20.940 --> 03:26.140]  Now let's talk briefly about photo period. Photo period means that a plant
[03:26.140 --> 03:32.400]  is triggered into its flowering stage by a light cycle. In nature this light cycle
[03:32.400 --> 03:38.300]  is mostly dictated by your location in relation to the equator. Are you right on
[03:38.300 --> 03:42.540]  the equator? Are you far north or are you far south of the equator? Now as the
[03:42.540 --> 03:46.860]  seasons change, as fall rolls around, regions on the equator will start
[03:46.860 --> 03:52.260]  experiencing longer nights and shorter days. Those longer nights and shorter
[03:52.260 --> 03:56.220]  days tell our plant, hey winter is coming, you need to start producing your
[03:56.220 --> 04:00.140]  flowers so that you can reproduce before the end of the season. And that triggers
[04:00.140 --> 04:05.140]  the plant to go into flowering, that is its photo period. Indoors most cannabis
[04:05.140 --> 04:10.980]  plants require about a 12 hour dark period to induce flower. Outdoors can be
[04:10.980 --> 04:14.140]  different because the sun puts off different spectrums that trigger the
[04:14.140 --> 04:17.380]  plants to go to sleep. As the sun sets it puts off a red spectrum that tells that
[04:17.380 --> 04:20.340]  plant hey it's nighttime and then it starts going to sleep. As the sun rises
[04:20.340 --> 04:23.740]  it puts off a blue spectrum that tells the plant it's time to wake up. So you
[04:23.740 --> 04:29.340]  don't need the 12-12 outdoors. You can work closer to a 14 hour day and more of
[04:29.340 --> 04:33.340]  a 10 hour night outdoors because the sun tells the plants to go to sleep. But that
[04:33.340 --> 04:37.780]  is photo period. The plants work off the light cycle and the light cycle works
[04:37.900 --> 04:42.180]  with nature outdoors. Indoors we're controlling that with a timer. So that is
[04:42.180 --> 04:46.500]  basically photo period. If your seeds are marked regular seeds or if it says photo
[04:46.500 --> 04:51.020]  on the package, that indicates that those plants will be triggered to flower by
[04:51.020 --> 04:56.300]  reducing your light schedule to 12 hours on and 12 hours off. Now regular seeds
[04:56.300 --> 05:01.140]  also indicates that there will be males and females in that package of seeds. If
[05:01.140 --> 05:04.300]  you're trying to grow a seedless crop you will have to pay attention and keep
[05:04.300 --> 05:08.380]  the males out of the flowering room. Somewhere between 7 and 10 days those
[05:08.380 --> 05:11.180]  plants will start showing their sex. You'll have to go through and pull out
[05:11.180 --> 05:15.620]  all of the males. If you leave one male plant in there for too long it will
[05:15.620 --> 05:20.380]  pollinate and all of the plants around it will be seeded. And depending on how
[05:20.380 --> 05:24.300]  long you let that male go and how much pollen he released and how much wind flow
[05:24.300 --> 05:28.380]  and how much movement you have in that grow, you may seed the entire crop with
[05:28.380 --> 05:33.300]  just one male. So that is basically regular seed. They are regular seed. They
[05:33.300 --> 05:37.940]  were bred conventionally, traditionally with a male and a female plant. They are
[05:37.940 --> 05:41.340]  photosensitive which means they will trigger into flower by reducing the
[05:41.340 --> 05:46.180]  lights to approximately 12 hours on and 12 hours off. Some plants will work one
[05:46.180 --> 05:50.140]  hour either direction. You could go 13 hours on, you could go 13 hours off, you
[05:50.140 --> 05:55.340]  could play with that. But we recommend 12-12 as the critical period. Also you
[05:55.340 --> 06:00.060]  will find males and females in your regular seeds. If you're not looking to
[06:00.060 --> 06:03.700]  do any breeding, if you want to grow seedless cannabis, you do need to cull
[06:03.700 --> 06:09.060]  those males. So that's the only major downfall of regular seeds. When you buy a
[06:09.060 --> 06:13.180]  package of regular seeds you've got about a 50-50 chance of getting males
[06:13.180 --> 06:17.860]  and females. It's hard to dictate what you get with regular seeds. Now a lot of
[06:17.860 --> 06:21.740]  people don't want to waste the energy, the time, the space, or the money buying
[06:21.740 --> 06:25.700]  and growing seeds that could possibly be males and need to be removed from the
[06:25.700 --> 06:30.580]  garden. Now that is where feminized seeds come into play. A lot of people
[06:30.580 --> 06:34.100]  have hatred toward feminized seeds because they are misinformed. A lot of
[06:34.100 --> 06:38.780]  people have hatred or a bias against feminized seeds because there were a few
[06:38.780 --> 06:42.660]  breeders back in the day that put out a batch of feminized seeds that were total
[06:42.660 --> 06:46.220]  shit and a few people bought those and it put a bad taste in their mouth and
[06:46.220 --> 06:49.700]  those people spread that taste throughout the internet. And I understand
[06:49.700 --> 06:53.500]  when you get a terrible product you want to tell people, people believe you, I get
[06:53.540 --> 06:57.820]  that. But that was way back in the day. We have come a long way since then. We
[06:57.820 --> 07:01.780]  understand how to produce feminized seeds on a commercial scale and there
[07:01.780 --> 07:06.460]  are a lot of breeders and producers out there putting out reliable quality
[07:06.460 --> 07:11.340]  feminized seeds. When they are made properly, feminized seeds will produce
[07:11.340 --> 07:18.700]  plants that give you 99.9% females. This is nature and science together so there
[07:18.820 --> 07:23.540]  will be anomalies. You will find things that don't fall into the chart that we
[07:23.540 --> 07:29.420]  drew because that's how nature works. That's why we say 99.9%. If I do my job
[07:29.420 --> 07:36.140]  correctly when I produce feminized seeds you will get 99.9% female plants. I'll
[07:36.140 --> 07:40.620]  give you a brief explanation on how I make feminized seeds and how a lot of
[07:40.620 --> 07:46.140]  the leading feminized seed producers make their products. I create a solution
[07:46.220 --> 07:50.220]  of silver thiosulfate that is really easy to learn how to do. All the
[07:50.220 --> 07:53.340]  instructions for that are readily available on the internet. You can make a
[07:53.340 --> 07:57.300]  silver thiosulfate solution from products that are easily attainable on
[07:57.300 --> 08:02.420]  the internet for less than $30. Get these products. I use product number one and
[08:02.420 --> 08:05.860]  product number two. I mix them into water then I mix the two things of water
[08:05.860 --> 08:10.140]  together. Now I've got my silver thiosulfate concentration. I dilute that.
[08:10.140 --> 08:15.460]  Each plant that I'm using requires a different dilution and application rate.
[08:15.500 --> 08:19.580]  There's a standard that I start with. The basic dilution that I recommend to
[08:19.580 --> 08:25.380]  start with would be a one to nine ratio of silver thiosulfate to water. You've
[08:25.380 --> 08:30.060]  got nine parts water, one part of the silver thiosulfate concentrate mixed
[08:30.060 --> 08:34.340]  into there. Shake that up real well and apply that to the plant on the first day
[08:34.340 --> 08:39.100]  of flower and then apply it every three days for 21 days. You're going to give
[08:39.100 --> 08:44.020]  the plant seven full applications and spray it until it drips and get the
[08:44.020 --> 08:48.020]  stalks. Don't just get the leaves. Get in there and spray the stalks and be
[08:48.020 --> 08:51.660]  careful when you're using the silver thiosulfate spray because it may turn
[08:51.660 --> 08:55.580]  some things purple. If you've got a white wall, depending on what you're up
[08:55.580 --> 08:59.460]  against, whatever that hits it could turn it purple including your skin. So be
[08:59.460 --> 09:02.460]  careful. Wear gloves. Wear a mask when working with the silver thiosulfate
[09:02.460 --> 09:06.060]  solution. That is always my recommendation. So I take the silver
[09:06.060 --> 09:10.740]  thiosulfate solution that I have created. Then I apply it. I mix it at a dilution
[09:10.740 --> 09:15.260]  of nine to one. Nine parts distilled water, one part silver thiosulfate
[09:15.260 --> 09:19.580]  concentrate. Then I apply it to the plants every three days for 21 days. It
[09:19.580 --> 09:25.780]  gets 21 applications. Then usually around day 25 to 30, it starts putting out
[09:25.780 --> 09:29.300]  pollen. That's when I start collecting the pollen. I put something, usually a
[09:29.300 --> 09:32.140]  piece of glass, just depends on where I am and what I'm working with, I put a
[09:32.140 --> 09:35.300]  piece of glass near the plant, collect some pollen as it naturally falls out,
[09:35.300 --> 09:38.760]  pick the male flowers out of there, gather that, let it dry. Then when it
[09:38.760 --> 09:41.360]  really starts getting dumping, that's when I'll move it right over by the
[09:41.360 --> 09:44.760]  girls and give it a good shake. Now we have just made feminized seeds. I've
[09:44.760 --> 09:49.320]  still got six or seven weeks of nourishing those seeds, but if I have
[09:49.320 --> 09:52.760]  done everything carefully and done everything correctly, I have created
[09:52.760 --> 09:57.280]  feminized seeds. There should be no reason why those should be problematic
[09:57.280 --> 10:00.840]  unless I completely screw up the next six or seven weeks, which is very
[10:00.840 --> 10:04.320]  unlikely because all I've got to do is make sure the equipment functions, make
[10:04.320 --> 10:08.040]  sure everything stays on a 12-12 cycle. I've got to feed it properly. I know how
[10:08.040 --> 10:11.320]  to feed plants that are pregnant. I know how to produce quality seeds. I've got
[10:11.320 --> 10:15.440]  to defoliate properly. I've also got to make sure to keep everything pest and
[10:15.440 --> 10:19.120]  problem-free. I'm quite experienced at all of that so far, so there should be no
[10:19.120 --> 10:23.560]  problem. I also make sure to thoroughly test run every batch of seeds I make
[10:23.560 --> 10:27.600]  before they make it to market. I grow some out myself. I give a bunch out to
[10:27.600 --> 10:30.360]  my friends. I'm sure you guys see on Instagram, people have the new stuff.
[10:30.360 --> 10:33.720]  You're like, how did they get that? It's because they grew something of mine. I
[10:33.720 --> 10:36.800]  was impressed by it. I reached out to them and I said, hey, do you want to run
[10:36.800 --> 10:40.360]  my next batch? I need you to take good notes, take good photos, send it all back
[10:40.360 --> 10:43.960]  to me, and then I'll know if I want to release that line or not. So I have other
[10:43.960 --> 10:47.840]  people grow it. I grow it myself. We test it before it's put out to market. That
[10:47.840 --> 10:51.880]  way I know that you're receiving a quality product. I'm gonna go off way on
[10:51.880 --> 10:55.680]  a side rant here that's not even written down. When I make a new strain, so let's
[10:55.680 --> 10:59.760]  just say I just pulled some seeds out of a plant last night. That's a brand new
[10:59.760 --> 11:02.800]  cross. Nobody's ever seen it. I've never seen it. I don't know what it's gonna do.
[11:03.360 --> 11:07.240]  Before those seeds go anywhere, I'm going to throw a handful of them in a paper
[11:07.240 --> 11:11.440]  towel and germinate them. And then in 24 hours, I'm gonna pop it open and I'm
[11:11.440 --> 11:14.840]  gonna see how many have sprouted tails. And I'm gonna make a note and I'm gonna
[11:14.840 --> 11:19.360]  write down the ratio. However, out of 100, they sprouted tails or they did not
[11:19.360 --> 11:23.520]  sprout tails. Then I'll close it back up and I'll let the other ones keep going
[11:23.520 --> 11:27.840]  and I'll see in 36 hours how many made tails and I'll take good notes. Then I'll
[11:27.840 --> 11:30.760]  put some of those, the ones that did sprout tails and look good, I'm gonna put
[11:30.760 --> 11:33.760]  those into some cups of dirt and I'm gonna grow them and I'm gonna pay
[11:33.760 --> 11:36.880]  attention to them and I'm gonna keep a lot of notes. I'm gonna veg them. I'm
[11:36.880 --> 11:41.000]  gonna flower them. I'm gonna grow them. I'm gonna dry them, cure them, smoke them,
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.200]  make concentrates out of them, smoke the concentrates. We're at least 120 days
[11:46.200 --> 11:50.880]  from even knowing what that product tastes like. Probably closer to 150 with
[11:50.880 --> 11:55.240]  the dry and cure phase in there. Then that is my first grow with it. If I
[11:55.240 --> 11:59.360]  approve, then I'll pass some seeds on to Grim. If Grimble grows it and it looks
[11:59.360 --> 12:03.320]  good in his garden, I'll spread it out to a few more people. If they grow it
[12:03.320 --> 12:08.120]  well, that's when I'll let it go to a vendor or for retail. But I test the
[12:08.120 --> 12:11.680]  shit out of my feminized seeds and my regular seeds. So I stand behind my
[12:11.680 --> 12:16.560]  product and honestly, every feminized seed that I produce sells. I can't keep
[12:16.560 --> 12:20.880]  feminized seeds in stock and I don't get any complaints on my feminized seed
[12:20.880 --> 12:25.160]  products. So that's how Fems are made. That's how I make my Fems. The advantage
[12:25.160 --> 12:29.480]  to feminized seeds is there are no males to remove from the garden. You know
[12:29.480 --> 12:33.600]  that every seed you plant will result in a harvested crop. You won't have to grow
[12:33.600 --> 12:37.720]  it long enough to sex it. You won't be wasting any time. That's advantageous for
[12:37.720 --> 12:42.160]  people who live in medical states or anybody who is limited by a plant count.
[12:42.160 --> 12:47.160]  So your feminized seeds are all going to be females. Now you would say, why would
[12:47.160 --> 12:50.920]  people grow photo period seeds when they can grow feminized seeds and guarantee
[12:50.920 --> 12:55.360]  that everything they grow makes it to harvest? Like I said, a lot of people have
[12:55.360 --> 13:02.000]  a bias against feminized seeds. Also, a lot of people like myself like finding
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.240]  the males. Breeding with females and reversed females and alpha females is a
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.960]  great practice, but I like working with a solid male plant. I've got a passion for
[13:10.960 --> 13:15.040]  conventional breeding. I do make feminized seeds, but I have more fun with
[13:15.040 --> 13:18.560]  conventional breeding. Another thing you may notice when you're shopping for seeds
[13:18.720 --> 13:23.520]  is that feminized seeds are about twice the price of regular seeds. So yes, you do
[13:23.520 --> 13:27.920]  get viable females that you can take to harvest, but that pack of seeds cost
[13:27.920 --> 13:31.640]  exactly twice as what a regular pack of seeds cost. Although you didn't have to
[13:31.640 --> 13:35.280]  waste the time, the space, the soil, the energy, and you didn't have to have that
[13:35.280 --> 13:39.480]  extra plant count to add to your numbers in your legal garden. So if the packaging
[13:39.480 --> 13:45.080]  says feminized seeds, that means that 99.9% of the plants that come out of that
[13:45.200 --> 13:49.440]  seed package will be females. Now here's something that is kind of a side rant
[13:49.440 --> 13:52.880]  that I was talking to somebody on social media about that I want to include in a
[13:52.880 --> 13:57.000]  podcast. I'm just going to give it a couple of seconds. We talk about the flip.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.760]  When we flip to flower, feminized and regular photo period seeds, we flip them
[14:02.760 --> 14:08.040]  to flower by changing the light cycle either from 24 on and 0 off to 18 on and
[14:08.040 --> 14:11.960]  6 off or however you've got your light cycle set up. Then you switch to 12 on
[14:11.960 --> 14:15.600]  and 12 off. You are now in flower. Or if you're going to follow the DJ short
[14:15.600 --> 14:20.600]  plan, you go 11 on 13 off. That's a whole other podcast. Anyway, we flip to
[14:20.600 --> 14:26.520]  flower. That is day one of flower. Your seed package will give you an estimate
[14:26.520 --> 14:31.520]  of how long they need to flower, 9 to 10 weeks, 60 to 70 days, whatever it says.
[14:31.920 --> 14:37.320]  The day you initiated that flip is day one. Not the day you see bud set, not the
[14:37.320 --> 14:41.400]  day you smell something, not the day the butterflies flew in and did their magic
[14:41.400 --> 14:45.680]  dance. The day you change that timer is day one of flower. That's how you keep
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.120]  track of that. That's what we're talking about when we indicated that on the seed
[14:50.120 --> 14:53.880]  package. Just wanted to add that side note. I'm not sure if that was even
[14:53.880 --> 14:57.800]  relevant, but there you go. A little bonus nugget for your brain. All right,
[14:57.800 --> 15:01.320]  now let's work into auto flowering seeds. Let's talk about auto flowers.
[15:01.320 --> 15:05.480]  What do I mean by an auto flowering seed? Earlier, I was talking about your
[15:05.560 --> 15:10.480]  location in relation to the equator. Most of us live in an area where we see
[15:10.480 --> 15:14.960]  seasonal changes and we also see changes in day and nighttime. But keep in mind,
[15:15.160 --> 15:19.720]  there are parts of Russia and Alaska that will receive extreme stretches of
[15:19.720 --> 15:23.840]  daylight and nighttime without interruption. There are some points in
[15:23.840 --> 15:29.480]  Alaska when they will have full sunlight for 80 days in a row. They will not get
[15:29.480 --> 15:36.200]  a night for 80 solid days. Cannabis is an extraordinary plant and it has evolved.
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.560]  The cannabis that we're familiar with, which has evolved from these extreme
[15:40.560 --> 15:45.920]  conditions with no dark, is known as ruderalis. These ruderalis plants have
[15:45.920 --> 15:50.800]  evolved to flower without any dark period. After so many generations, they
[15:50.800 --> 15:54.760]  went, hey, it doesn't get dark. We need to do something about this. So through
[15:54.760 --> 16:00.200]  evolution, they started to flower without a dark period. A lot of those ruderalis
[16:00.200 --> 16:05.640]  plants have no desirable effect when smoked, but they have a lot of desirable
[16:05.640 --> 16:09.920]  traits when grown. Some of them stay short, they stay squat, they push out
[16:09.920 --> 16:14.000]  really nicely, and you don't have to change the light cycle to convince them
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.680]  to flower for you. So cannabis breeders got a hold of ruderalis plants and they
[16:19.680 --> 16:24.640]  bred them together. They bred our auto flowering ruderalis to our high potency
[16:24.760 --> 16:29.560]  cannabis plants and the offspring resulted in high potency auto flowering
[16:29.560 --> 16:33.600]  cannabis plants. Most of the auto flowering seeds available for most
[16:33.600 --> 16:38.080]  breeders now are feminized. So you'll get auto flowering seeds that are all
[16:38.080 --> 16:41.440]  girls, which is really advantageous. And we'll talk about that in just a minute.
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.160]  I should warn you that when you're looking at seeds and you see feminized
[16:45.160 --> 16:49.680]  seeds on there, also look to see if they say photo period or auto flower on there.
[16:49.680 --> 16:53.360]  Make sure they indicate that. If they don't, they are probably photo period.
[16:53.520 --> 16:57.080]  All of the auto flower guys like to let you know that you're working with auto
[16:57.080 --> 17:01.000]  flowers. They clearly indicate that on the package. And earlier I mentioned that
[17:01.000 --> 17:06.360]  feminized seeds cost twice as much as regular auto flowers generally cost twice
[17:06.360 --> 17:10.400]  as much as feminized. So you got your regular, then they're doubled, then
[17:10.400 --> 17:13.920]  they're even doubled again. So they will let you know if they're auto flowers.
[17:13.920 --> 17:16.760]  Just make sure you read the package when you're buying your seed. That'll either
[17:16.760 --> 17:21.440]  say regular or feminized or auto flower. Just do a little research before you buy
[17:21.440 --> 17:24.840]  your seeds. Make sure you know what you're getting. Now let's talk a little
[17:24.840 --> 17:29.840]  bit about how these auto flower seeds are useful. If you've been listening to
[17:29.840 --> 17:33.400]  the show for a while, you love my favorite example of these auto flowers
[17:33.400 --> 17:38.360]  and use several years ago, there was a very large grow discovered in a national
[17:38.360 --> 17:43.160]  forest, not too far from here. And it was discovered that that grow was ran by a
[17:43.160 --> 17:47.960]  cartel. As the reports and pictures came out, they were saying that the cartel had
[17:47.960 --> 17:52.240]  three different stages of growth happening in their illegal grow area. Now
[17:52.240 --> 17:56.040]  that really made me wonder, how are they growing different stages outdoors?
[17:56.120 --> 17:59.760]  Because the sun dictates what our plants do. If they put them outside, they all
[17:59.760 --> 18:02.960]  went into flower at the same time. Then my brain went, dude, they're using auto
[18:02.960 --> 18:08.520]  flowers. So this large cartel would set a patch of auto flower plants. Then they
[18:08.520 --> 18:11.720]  would wait a few weeks and they would set another large patch of auto flower
[18:11.720 --> 18:16.080]  plants, wait a few weeks and set another large patch of auto flower plants to
[18:16.080 --> 18:19.720]  where eventually they had a perpetual cycle going to where they had people out
[18:19.720 --> 18:24.800]  there in this national forest, camouflaged, hidden, growing a perpetual
[18:24.800 --> 18:28.360]  grow, packaging up and sending it to who knows where, I have no idea where it was
[18:28.360 --> 18:32.120]  going, but they were producing quite a bit of cannabis out there by using auto
[18:32.120 --> 18:36.040]  flowers. They had a perpetual grow under the natural sun. They didn't have to
[18:36.040 --> 18:39.160]  veg and then flower. They could just throw the seeds out there. They would
[18:39.160 --> 18:43.960]  grow and do their thing. So that's one way where auto flower seeds were highly
[18:43.960 --> 18:47.920]  effective. Now let's scale that down a little bit. Let's say you've only got one
[18:47.920 --> 18:52.640]  grow space and you want to produce a perpetual grow. You don't have a veg room.
[18:52.800 --> 18:56.680]  You don't have a flower room. You can't go buy clones from a friend. You can't
[18:56.680 --> 19:00.480]  have a friend veg for you. The way you could run a small self-sustainable
[19:00.480 --> 19:05.320]  perpetual grow is with auto flower plants in one room. Fill up a quarter or
[19:05.320 --> 19:08.960]  half of the room with auto flowers. As soon as they start flowering, plant more
[19:08.960 --> 19:12.840]  auto flowers and put them in the same room. You'll have veg plants and flowering
[19:12.840 --> 19:17.320]  plants in the same room. You can't do that with photo period plants. So if
[19:17.320 --> 19:20.720]  you're limited on space, if you've only got one room, that's a really useful
[19:20.920 --> 19:26.240]  method and a really useful application for auto flowering plants. The major
[19:26.240 --> 19:30.080]  downside that I see to auto flowering plants is you always have to buy new
[19:30.080 --> 19:34.600]  seeds. You cannot clone an auto flowering plant. If you're growing with regular or
[19:34.600 --> 19:38.640]  feminized photo period seeds, you're always able to cut a clone. You can keep
[19:38.640 --> 19:42.080]  that clone as a mother. You can keep it perpetually and then you can always clone
[19:42.080 --> 19:46.320]  off of that mother and you can keep that plant sustainable. With auto flowers,
[19:46.320 --> 19:50.440]  you're always going to be buying new seeds. And earlier I mentioned most of
[19:50.480 --> 19:53.920]  the auto flower companies are only putting out feminized, so you're not even
[19:53.920 --> 19:58.120]  able to breed your own auto flowers with males and females anymore. You're going
[19:58.120 --> 20:02.080]  to have to reverse one and I have no experience doing that. All right, you
[20:02.080 --> 20:06.800]  guys, that is my breakdown on regular seeds, feminized seeds, and auto flowering
[20:06.800 --> 20:11.400]  seeds. The regular seeds are always photo period. I like them because we find
[20:11.400 --> 20:15.080]  males and females. I like breeding with the regular seeds. That's a lot of fun
[20:15.080 --> 20:20.040]  for me. The feminized seeds can be photo period or they can be auto flower. They
[20:20.080 --> 20:23.720]  are probably well marked on the packaging. Those are always going to be
[20:23.720 --> 20:27.920]  females if they were bred properly. I've done a whole nother podcast episode
[20:27.920 --> 20:32.480]  about marking feminized seeds with S or R1 generations. I encourage you to
[20:32.480 --> 20:36.920]  listen to that one. That one is episode 331 and it's titled Selfing and
[20:36.920 --> 20:40.560]  Reversals. You'll learn a lot about why we label the packages the way we do.
[20:40.800 --> 20:45.280]  Also, I recommend you listen to an episode called Seed Pack Expectations and
[20:45.280 --> 20:49.400]  that is number 245. There's a lot of useful information in that episode for
[20:49.400 --> 20:52.960]  anyone who is considering purchasing new seeds. Then we'll keep it moving. We
[20:52.960 --> 20:56.800]  talked about auto flowering seeds. Auto flowering plants are unique to photo
[20:56.800 --> 21:01.000]  period plants because they flower based on their size or their age. We can put
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.560]  them under the veg lights. We can have them in the 18-6 room and they will
[21:04.560 --> 21:08.680]  still flower and they will still produce buds. A lot of auto flowering plants
[21:08.680 --> 21:13.440]  boast that they will be completely done around 10 weeks. That's 70 days of a
[21:13.440 --> 21:18.240]  full cycle with a photo period plant. You've got closer to 120 days if you
[21:18.240 --> 21:24.000]  want usable product. That is my lesson on regular feminized and auto flowering
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.920]  seeds. I hope I made your decision easier when it comes time to go shopping.
[21:28.080 --> 21:31.600]  Don't be afraid to try regular seeds. Don't be afraid to try feminized seeds
[21:31.760 --> 21:35.240]  and don't be afraid to try auto flower seeds. You just may fall in love with
[21:35.240 --> 21:38.800]  something you never thought you would even like. Don't forget, you can find
[21:38.800 --> 21:43.520]  your seeds at dankseed.store. We're working on a Black Friday sale, you
[21:43.520 --> 21:47.040]  guys. This should get interesting. You guys, I've only been going for about
[21:47.040 --> 21:50.280]  22 minutes, but honestly, my recording gear has been giving me a couple of
[21:50.280 --> 21:53.800]  technical issues and my throat is obviously burning out. I'm going to wrap
[21:53.800 --> 21:57.520]  this up while I've still got a quality podcast on the screen. I don't want to
[21:57.520 --> 22:01.280]  lose any of the stuff I recorded. Please do support me on Patreon at
