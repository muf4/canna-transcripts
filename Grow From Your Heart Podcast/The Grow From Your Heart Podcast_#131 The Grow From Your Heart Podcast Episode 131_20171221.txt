[00:17.660 --> 00:23.660]  Welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 131 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.660 --> 00:27.660]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.660 --> 00:31.660]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a news smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.660 --> 00:36.660]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.660 --> 00:39.660]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.660 --> 00:43.660]  I'm your host, my friends, call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.660 --> 00:49.660]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my show.
[00:49.660 --> 00:53.660]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.660 --> 00:57.660]  You guys, make sure you catch the Mystic Roots band on tour this summer with Catchafire.
[00:57.660 --> 01:02.660]  They're doing like five or six Colorado shows. I will be at probably one or two of them.
[01:02.660 --> 01:05.660]  And I do hope to see your smiling face there.
[01:05.660 --> 01:10.660]  Make sure you walk up to me, tell me that you heard about the concert through the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:10.660 --> 01:13.660]  Introduce yourself. I would love to meet you. I'd love to shake your hand.
[01:13.660 --> 01:15.660]  I'll probably smoke a dab with you after the show.
[01:15.660 --> 01:21.660]  All right. Make sure you guys support the Mystic Roots band and the Catchafire tour traveling all around the country this summer.
[01:21.660 --> 01:25.660]  Excuse me for the coughing. I just took some fat dabs, of course, right?
[01:25.660 --> 01:28.660]  We're doing a podcast. What else do I do? Take some fat dabs.
[01:28.660 --> 01:33.660]  Tonight, I'm hitting the Hitman Samson collab. I got a sweet-ass Hitman rig.
[01:33.660 --> 01:38.660]  It's got a green, kind of a teal green aquamarine mix base on it.
[01:38.660 --> 01:45.660]  It's got some green labels to it. Of course, I've got that hooked up to the G-Nail, the E-Nail from our good friends at Emotech.
[01:45.660 --> 01:51.660]  Shout out to them. And then that, of course, runs to the D-Nail adapter from our good friends at Highly Educated Titanium.
[01:51.660 --> 01:55.660]  So shout out to everybody that keeps me laced up, keeps me dabbing, keeps me dabbing my face off.
[01:55.660 --> 01:59.660]  I appreciate all the vendors. Also, while I'm at it, huge shout out to our friends at Oil Slick.
[01:59.660 --> 02:02.660]  We cannot forget Oil Slick. Much love to the entire Oil Slick crew.
[02:02.660 --> 02:06.660]  All right, guys, let's get into a podcast. I got some stuff I want to talk about.
[02:06.660 --> 02:10.660]  Guess what? It finally happened. Yesterday, I got fucking pulled over.
[02:10.660 --> 02:15.660]  I was going a little bit too fast on the interstate. I saw him get behind me. I said,
[02:15.660 --> 02:19.660]  Ah, shit, here they come. And here he was right away. Those red and blue lights got right up on my ass.
[02:19.660 --> 02:24.660]  He got up behind me. I pulled over quickly because I saw that he was there.
[02:24.660 --> 02:28.660]  I happen to be wearing my brand new I'm Higher Than You t-shirt. Shout out to my buddy Adam Mill.
[02:28.660 --> 02:32.660]  He threw me an I'm Higher Than You t-shirt. So I've got this shirt on that says straight up I'm higher than you.
[02:32.660 --> 02:36.660]  And I get pulled over by the state patrol. State Trooper was actually pretty damn cool.
[02:36.660 --> 02:40.660]  He walked up to me and he said, Sir, I pulled you over because you were going a little too fast.
[02:40.660 --> 02:44.660]  My only answer was yes, sir, because I knew I was going too fucking fast. So I told him, yes, sir.
[02:44.660 --> 02:48.660]  He said, Can I see your license, registration, proof of insurance? And I already had it in my hand because I'm quick and organized.
[02:48.660 --> 02:54.660]  I was like, Here you go, sir. And he said, Do you have any marijuana in the vehicle?
[02:54.660 --> 02:58.660]  And I hesitated for a minute and I wasn't going to lie to him. I was thinking.
[02:58.660 --> 03:04.660]  I looked at my backpack and I looked at my center console in my car and I looked for the backseat to see where all my bags were and see what I had with me.
[03:04.660 --> 03:08.660]  And I looked him straight in the face and I said, There might be some weed in here, sir.
[03:08.660 --> 03:14.660]  And he kind of looked at me weird and I said, But I've got a medical marijuana card and I assure you I'm not intoxicated by any means.
[03:14.660 --> 03:20.660]  And it was early in the morning. I was on my way to work. And so he goes, Well, it really smells in there.
[03:20.660 --> 03:26.660]  And I said, Oh, and I had my when you work in a legal facility here in Colorado, you've got to wear a badge and I happen to have it on me.
[03:26.660 --> 03:30.660]  So I just showed him my badge real quick. I said, Sir, I work in a grow, so I always stink.
[03:30.660 --> 03:35.660]  And this cop, you guys, this is why I'm telling you this story. This cop looked at me and he said, Oh, I understand.
[03:35.660 --> 03:39.660]  My daughter works in a grow as well. Hang tight. I'm going to go run your plate.
[03:39.660 --> 03:46.660]  So this cop, his daughter, this guy's a state trooper and his daughter works in a grow here in Colorado.
[03:46.660 --> 03:50.660]  So he goes and he runs my plates and runs my license. I'm not wanted or anything. I'm legit.
[03:50.660 --> 03:58.660]  So I just sat there and waited. I actually took a Snapchat. So if you want to see up on my Instagram and on Snapchat and on Facebook, there's a picture of me being pulled over by this cop.
[03:58.660 --> 04:02.660]  So he goes and he runs my license. He does what he's got to do. He's actually pretty quick about it.
[04:02.660 --> 04:06.660]  A couple of times I've been pulled over and they make you just fucking sit there all day and make sure you're late for work.
[04:06.660 --> 04:11.660]  But this guy was pretty quick. He went and he wrote me a warning. He did not write me a speeding ticket.
[04:11.660 --> 04:16.660]  He wrote me an official warning and he told me to set it on the dash to remind me to quit speeding.
[04:16.660 --> 04:25.660]  So I did that. I've got the warning sitting up on the dash so that every time I start to get in the left lane to pass somebody, it reminds me of, hey, you're going to get a ticket next time because that cop was really cool to you last time.
[04:25.660 --> 04:32.660]  So I've got a warning sitting up there. I want to give a huge shout out to the state trooper. I'm not going to say his name, but shout out to the state trooper.
[04:32.660 --> 04:39.660]  He did not harass me when I completely reeked of cannabis. He did not write me a ticket when I was obviously blatantly speeding.
[04:39.660 --> 04:45.660]  So a big shout out to the Colorado State Patrol. I appreciate it. You did not fuck my day up. You did not fuck my life up.
[04:45.660 --> 04:49.660]  Things could have gone very differently as we've learned with my friend John Randall's Jr.
[04:49.660 --> 04:54.660]  So a big shout out to the state patrol. Big shout out to Jara's to far I for keeping a straight through that.
[04:54.660 --> 05:02.660]  Yeah. So you guys, it's all about how you handle the police. If you're in Colorado and you get pulled over and they ask if you've got cannabis in the car, just admit it.
[05:02.660 --> 05:07.660]  Because lying to the cops is illegal. Having cannabis in Colorado is not illegal.
[05:07.660 --> 05:11.660]  If you're going to lie to him about having weed, he's not going to trust you. He's going to think you're hiding some shit.
[05:11.660 --> 05:17.660]  You don't need to hide your weed in Colorado. This is Colorado. As long as you don't have pounds, if you've got your legal limit, you should be legit.
[05:17.660 --> 05:22.660]  Don't even lie. And if you are doing something illegal and you got more than you should, don't fucking speed.
[05:22.660 --> 05:26.660]  I think we went over that in a previous episode. Only break one rule at a time, you guys.
[05:26.660 --> 05:32.660]  All right. I'll quit talking about a traffic stop. Since we're talking about the police, here's one more thing I do need to mention.
[05:32.660 --> 05:38.660]  I am I don't know if everybody that listens realizes that I am the owner, founder, proprietor, head breeder.
[05:38.660 --> 05:44.660]  I am I Read Genetics Colorado. I am the seed company that makes feminized irregular cannabis seeds.
[05:44.660 --> 05:51.660]  I receive a lot of messages on Instagram, Facebook, emails, any forum you could think of.
[05:51.660 --> 05:57.660]  I get an email or a message via that service asking me to ship seeds to people in various locations.
[05:57.660 --> 06:03.660]  You guys, I might have said this on another episode, but I have to remind you, I cannot ship seeds to anybody.
[06:03.660 --> 06:08.660]  I am trying to be fully legal. I'm trying to be fully legit. I'm trying not to break any rules here in Colorado.
[06:08.660 --> 06:13.660]  They're letting us grow. I've got a wonderful job at Green and Healthy Wellness is the lead grower.
[06:13.660 --> 06:17.660]  There's no need for me to screw that up in my life by sending people seeds to make a few extra bucks.
[06:17.660 --> 06:24.660]  I'm doing just fine financially. I'm doing fucking great financially. Not to brag, but I mean, there's no I don't even need to send you seeds.
[06:24.660 --> 06:29.660]  I'm doing OK. There is a website, however. They are called the dank team dot com.
[06:29.660 --> 06:33.660]  Sometimes they have my seeds available. They are currently sold out is what I'm told.
[06:33.660 --> 06:38.660]  They will get a package in the future. I can't promise you when. I don't know when they'll put them on sale.
[06:38.660 --> 06:42.660]  I don't know if they'll even make it to the website. They may have people lined up on a waiting list already.
[06:42.660 --> 06:47.660]  I don't know. What I do know is as soon as they get those seeds, they sell out quickly.
[06:47.660 --> 06:52.660]  So you'll have to pay attention to the dank team dot com if you're trying to get seeds.
[06:52.660 --> 06:57.660]  If they don't have i.re genetic seeds, check out Sin City, check out Mile High, check out Canaventure.
[06:58.660 --> 07:04.660]  Rare dankness is always good. I'm not sure if the sour seed company is on there, but I highly recommend the sour seed company.
[07:04.660 --> 07:09.660]  You can never go wrong with the Cali connection and you can never go wrong with DJ short seeds.
[07:09.660 --> 07:14.660]  So find yourself some good seeds, even if they aren't i.re seeds, you can get them at the dank team dot com.
[07:14.660 --> 07:19.660]  I apologize that I can't ship you seeds, you guys trying to be safe, trying to be careful, trying not to break any rules.
[07:19.660 --> 07:24.660]  If you're here in Colorado and you're 21 and over, find me. Let's get together.
[07:24.660 --> 07:27.660]  We can put some seeds in your garden.
[07:27.660 --> 07:31.660]  Alright, I just wanted to be fair, wanted to be polite about that. I can't ship you anything.
[07:31.660 --> 07:37.660]  What's next? Alright, I got an email. Actually, this was a Facebook message. I'm going to go ahead and open up the Facebook page.
[07:37.660 --> 07:42.660]  I've got it. It's taking my phone a second.
[07:42.660 --> 07:46.660]  I might edit part of this out. Where's the damn message?
[07:46.660 --> 07:53.660]  Okay. Alright, so this message comes from a friend on the Grow From Your Heart podcast Facebook page.
[07:53.660 --> 07:56.660]  This is from our friend Elizabeth and she says, quick question.
[07:56.660 --> 08:02.660]  I'm growing a few plants from seed and I was wondering if when I take a cutting to flower for determining sex,
[08:02.660 --> 08:05.660]  if I should flower the clone or the rooted seedling.
[08:05.660 --> 08:08.660]  I could swear that I heard you say it was better to flower the rooted seedling.
[08:08.660 --> 08:11.660]  Did I remember that correctly?
[08:11.660 --> 08:17.660]  There is not a rule to this. This is kind of personal preference.
[08:18.660 --> 08:25.660]  Let me back up and tell you basically what this person is asking just to be more clear in case you guys aren't caught up to what the question here is.
[08:25.660 --> 08:32.660]  When you grow a plant from seed, you don't know if that plant is a male or a female unless of course it came from feminized seeds.
[08:32.660 --> 08:36.660]  If you grow a regular seed, it's got a 50-50 chance of being a male or a female.
[08:36.660 --> 08:43.660]  You don't want to waste a lot of time, space, energy, nutrients, and water on a plant that you don't need.
[08:43.660 --> 08:46.660]  So unless you're breeding, you need to eliminate your male plants.
[08:46.660 --> 08:52.660]  So once your seed plant gets large enough, I recommend taking a clone from it.
[08:52.660 --> 08:55.660]  Let that clone establish healthy roots.
[08:55.660 --> 09:03.660]  Now you need to flower either the original plant from seed or that clone to determine if that plant is a male or a female.
[09:03.660 --> 09:09.660]  It's really up to you if you want to flower out the plant that came from seed or if you want to flower the clone.
[09:10.660 --> 09:13.660]  There are advantages and disadvantages to both sides.
[09:13.660 --> 09:21.660]  If you've got that plant that came from seed and it's big enough to take a clone, once that clone is rooted and you know you've got a copy of it,
[09:21.660 --> 09:30.660]  you're safe to flower out that seed plant, the original plant from seed, because now you've got a backup in the clone room, in the mom room, whatever, in the bedroom.
[09:30.660 --> 09:38.660]  You've got a backup of that plant over there and you've already got a plant that's established and that's large and that's healthy and is ready to flower and ready to throw out some buds for you.
[09:38.660 --> 09:41.660]  So you can always flower out that seed plant.
[09:41.660 --> 09:46.660]  The advantage to that is it's already there. It's ready to go. You've got a big healthy plant.
[09:46.660 --> 09:51.660]  Some people really like to keep that original seeded plant from seed around as their mother.
[09:51.660 --> 09:57.660]  They like to keep that one because it was the original and they feel like it's got more vigor and it's got more strength to it.
[09:57.660 --> 10:06.660]  But I feel like if you take a clone and you do it properly and that clone is cared for and the mother plant, the donor plant, was healthy when the clone was taken,
[10:06.660 --> 10:10.660]  I feel like the clone and that seed plant are going to be the same thing.
[10:10.660 --> 10:17.660]  So you can take your clone, you can let your clone root, you can get your clone into soil, you can get it into a good pot, get some roots established.
[10:17.660 --> 10:22.660]  You can do it in a cup. I've done this in cups. I've ran pheno hunts from cups before.
[10:22.660 --> 10:26.660]  I've done plenty of plant sexting while clones were just in little tiny cups.
[10:26.660 --> 10:34.660]  So you can take your clone and you can either pot it into a larger pot if you want, or you can leave it in the cup and put it in the flower room and put it in the flower,
[10:34.660 --> 10:40.660]  change the lights to 1212. And of course, within seven to 10 days, you're going to see if that plant is a male or a female.
[10:40.660 --> 10:53.660]  Now, one of the main advantages to keeping your clones in cups and using the cup method to do a sexting round is that it takes way less space to run a whole bunch of cups than it would run a bunch of potted plants.
[10:53.660 --> 11:02.660]  So if you're doing a large pheno hunt of like maybe 25 to 50 plants, it's much easier to have 25 to 50 cups underneath the light with little tiny clones in there,
[11:02.660 --> 11:08.660]  just waiting to show you sex. And that way you didn't waste time growing large plants. And then you grew out a male that was a waste of time.
[11:08.660 --> 11:14.660]  So that's the advantage to do in the cups. It's one of the advantages. It's up to you, whichever you want to do, really.
[11:14.660 --> 11:19.660]  If you want to take it, always take a clone. So grow that plant from seed, take a clone, get the clone rooted.
[11:19.660 --> 11:24.660]  And then it's up to you. If you want to run that clone as your flowering plant to determine sex, go for it.
[11:25.660 --> 11:32.660]  If you want to run that seed as your flowering plant to determine sex, go for it. As long as you keep one of them back to have in the future.
[11:32.660 --> 11:37.660]  If you run that clone, you've already got a big mother plant waiting to give you more clones.
[11:37.660 --> 11:42.660]  If you run the mother plant that came from seed, you've already got a big bushy plant. There are advantages.
[11:42.660 --> 11:48.660]  In a production facility, what I do is I plant the seed, I let the seed grow, I take the clone.
[11:48.660 --> 11:52.660]  As soon as that clone shows me roots, I throw that clone into a pot.
[11:52.660 --> 11:57.660]  And then I actually flower out the original plant from seed because it's already big enough, it's ready to go.
[11:57.660 --> 12:04.660]  And honestly, in a commercial production facility, I don't have a lot of time and space for extra plants sitting around.
[12:04.660 --> 12:09.660]  And I don't want to waste my plant count because we are based on a plant count because we are a medical facility.
[12:09.660 --> 12:17.660]  We're allowed to have so many plants. So since I've already got a plant that's large enough to flower, I go ahead and flower that plant out to find out what I've got.
[12:17.660 --> 12:22.660]  If I find out that I've got a male, usually I go throw that, I cut that male down, take it out of the computer system.
[12:22.660 --> 12:27.660]  And then I go and take down every clone also that I have made of that male plant.
[12:27.660 --> 12:31.660]  And we eliminate those as well so that we don't have any males sitting around.
[12:31.660 --> 12:36.660]  And that is how, mainly how we work on sexing our plants.
[12:36.660 --> 12:42.660]  There is another method. This kind of helps me segue into something else I wanted to talk about, which is revegging.
[12:42.660 --> 12:47.660]  Another thing that you can do, I do not use this method. I know plenty of people that do.
[12:47.660 --> 12:57.660]  For me, this seems a little bit harsh to my plants. What some people do, you can take a plant and put it into your flowering room for 7 to 10 days, just long enough to show you sex.
[12:57.660 --> 13:03.660]  Usually, I think I can spot a male more early than I can a female because I've been doing it for so long.
[13:03.660 --> 13:06.660]  I think the males try to show you sex a little bit sooner.
[13:06.660 --> 13:10.660]  So, take your plants, put them in the flowering room, let them start showing you sex.
[13:10.660 --> 13:20.660]  As soon as you are sure of the sex, take them out of the flowering room, put them back in the veg room under 24 hours of light, and they will go back into veg for you.
[13:20.660 --> 13:23.660]  It may take them a couple of weeks, but they will go back into veg.
[13:23.660 --> 13:29.660]  So what some people do, they plant a seed, they let the seed grow until it's a decent size.
[13:29.660 --> 13:34.660]  Right when you put that seed into your 3 gallon pot, let it get rooted, and then move it to the flowering room.
[13:34.660 --> 13:36.660]  And then they just leave it there for a few days.
[13:36.660 --> 13:39.660]  And now they've got a little plant that's starting to show sex.
[13:39.660 --> 13:42.660]  And then as soon as it shows sex, they put it back in the veg room.
[13:42.660 --> 13:46.660]  If it's a female, they put it back into the veg room and grow it up to the bigger size that they want.
[13:46.660 --> 13:49.660]  Then take a clone from it and then flower that plant out.
[13:49.660 --> 13:52.660]  Now this sounds harsh, but it does have its advantages.
[13:52.660 --> 13:59.660]  The main advantage here is that you don't need to take any clones, and you don't waste a lot of time and space growing anything.
[13:59.660 --> 14:03.660]  So you take your plants and you put them into flower, and as soon as you see boys, you throw them away.
[14:03.660 --> 14:09.660]  And then now, you can just move your plants right back into the veg room and just grow those females up to their full size.
[14:09.660 --> 14:15.660]  So you establish sex without taking any clones, and now you know what you've got, and you've eliminated your boys.
[14:15.660 --> 14:18.660]  So when it comes flower time, you know you're working with all girls.
[14:18.660 --> 14:21.660]  I highly recommend taking a clone from everything.
[14:21.660 --> 14:26.660]  So before you flower those plants, please take a clone, because you might grow the most amazing cannabis you've ever had.
[14:26.660 --> 14:30.660]  And if you don't have a clone from it, you're going to kick yourself in the ass.
[14:30.660 --> 14:34.660]  Revegging is also used after harvest.
[14:34.660 --> 14:36.660]  I've seen people finish a plant.
[14:36.660 --> 14:39.660]  You take a plant that takes nine weeks to flower.
[14:39.660 --> 14:41.660]  You flower it out for nine weeks.
[14:41.660 --> 14:46.660]  You harvest most of it, but you just leave one or two branches on that plant.
[14:46.660 --> 14:53.660]  And then put that plant with one or two harvested plant with one or two branches on it under 24 hours of light.
[14:53.660 --> 15:00.660]  And it's going to take probably two months, honestly, before that plant starts to grow back as a normal vegging plant.
[15:00.660 --> 15:04.660]  And if you didn't take a clone, this is your only way to rescue your strain.
[15:04.660 --> 15:10.660]  You take this sad-looking, mostly harvested plant, and you torture it by putting it under a light for about two months.
[15:10.660 --> 15:14.660]  You want it under 24 hours of light, and you want to feed it kind of a heavy nitrogen diet.
[15:14.660 --> 15:17.660]  That'll bring it back around to the veg stage.
[15:17.660 --> 15:20.660]  The leaves are going to start curling and looking like arthritis hands.
[15:20.660 --> 15:22.660]  They're going to be spirally.
[15:22.660 --> 15:24.660]  The plant is going to be pissed off for quite a while.
[15:24.660 --> 15:29.660]  But as soon as you see those normal leaves start coming out, your plant is going back into its normal stage.
[15:29.660 --> 15:32.660]  The hormones have started reconverting back into the veg stage.
[15:32.660 --> 15:35.660]  It's starting to know what's going on with life again.
[15:35.660 --> 15:41.660]  What I would recommend at that point, as soon as you have a couple of healthy shoots that look normal, clone those.
[15:41.660 --> 15:44.660]  And take those clones and use those clones as your plants.
[15:44.660 --> 15:47.660]  And now you've got that strain around again.
[15:47.660 --> 15:51.660]  Keep one clone and flower out the other clones, and now you've got that strain forever.
[15:51.660 --> 15:55.660]  I don't recommend that, but if you do make the mistake of not taking a clone,
[15:55.660 --> 16:00.660]  and you realize that this plant that you're growing is going to be one of the most amazing things you've ever seen,
[16:00.660 --> 16:05.660]  revegging is probably the only way to rescue this strain, other than a tissue culture.
[16:05.660 --> 16:09.660]  And I am not prepared to teach you how to do a tissue culture through a podcast.
[16:10.660 --> 16:12.660]  So, Elizabeth, I hope I answered your question.
[16:12.660 --> 16:14.660]  I know I did not give a definitive answer.
[16:14.660 --> 16:18.660]  I know I said that it's kind of up to you and your environment and the way that you want to do things.
[16:18.660 --> 16:20.660]  But I hope I helped you out.
[16:20.660 --> 16:26.660]  And thanks for giving me the opportunity to talk about how to sex your plants and revegging.
[16:27.660 --> 16:33.660]  Alright, my next topic comes from at the Barefoot Grower on Instagram, also known as Will on Facebook.
[16:33.660 --> 16:35.660]  Will had no idea I was going to talk about this.
[16:35.660 --> 16:38.660]  Will posted a Facebook post today that simply said,
[16:38.660 --> 16:41.660]  Stop smoking blunts in your grow room.
[16:41.660 --> 16:43.660]  And that is such a good post.
[16:43.660 --> 16:46.660]  He had no idea I was going to talk about this on the podcast today.
[16:46.660 --> 16:51.660]  But I see people posting pictures of themselves on Facebook, on Instagram, and on Snapchat.
[16:51.660 --> 16:55.660]  And they are smoking blunts, smoking bulls, and smoking dabs in the grow room.
[16:55.660 --> 16:57.660]  And I think it's a really bad idea.
[16:57.660 --> 17:04.660]  I think smoking a blunt in a grow room is going to impart that blunt taste on your growing buds.
[17:04.660 --> 17:08.660]  Before those buds are even done, they're already going to taste like a dirty blunt wrap.
[17:08.660 --> 17:11.660]  I'm sorry you guys, I don't prefer the flavor of a blunt.
[17:11.660 --> 17:14.660]  We grow some of the best cannabis we can possibly grow on this planet.
[17:14.660 --> 17:17.660]  And then you wrap it up in a shitty ass tobacco leaf with some fake flavoring in it.
[17:17.660 --> 17:19.660]  I don't dig it.
[17:19.660 --> 17:21.660]  I smoked a backwood with my buddy the other day.
[17:21.660 --> 17:23.660]  Not my thing. I'm not into the blunts.
[17:23.660 --> 17:29.660]  But I feel that blowing this blunt smoke on your plants, around your plants, is going to make your plants taste like a dirty ass blunt.
[17:29.660 --> 17:32.660]  But also, here's what Will had to say about this.
[17:32.660 --> 17:38.660]  Will said, tobacco smoke is very thick and actually can suffocate your plants, stopping the photosynthesis process.
[17:38.660 --> 17:42.660]  Because the plant will be too busy breathing and filtering the smoke to take in CO2.
[17:42.660 --> 17:50.660]  And then he also goes on to say, also blunts and most over-the-counter tobacco products have a ton of chemicals in them that are bad for your plants.
[17:50.660 --> 17:55.660]  Cigarettes are the main concern, but blunts will begin to show harmful results if done regularly and frequently.
[17:55.660 --> 17:58.660]  Really, you shouldn't smoke anything in your grow room.
[17:58.660 --> 17:59.660]  I agree with that.
[17:59.660 --> 18:02.660]  And then he says, but if you're going to, it should be a bowl.
[18:02.660 --> 18:07.660]  The less carcinogens in the air, the healthier your plants will be.
[18:07.660 --> 18:09.660]  I think I agree with that, Will.
[18:09.660 --> 18:11.660]  Good post, great post, you guys.
[18:11.660 --> 18:13.660]  Quit smoking in your grow rooms.
[18:13.660 --> 18:15.660]  You don't want to be in the grow room giving your plants smoke.
[18:15.660 --> 18:18.660]  You want to be in the grow room giving your plants love and CO2.
[18:18.660 --> 18:20.660]  Don't blow smoke in there.
[18:20.660 --> 18:21.660]  Just keep the plants clean.
[18:21.660 --> 18:22.660]  You're going to ruin the terpenes.
[18:22.660 --> 18:24.660]  It's all about the terps nowadays.
[18:24.660 --> 18:26.660]  And nobody wants tobacco terps in their cannabis.
[18:26.660 --> 18:27.660]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[18:27.660 --> 18:32.660]  Maybe somebody wants tobacco terps in their cannabis, but 99% of the world doesn't want tobacco terps in their cannabis,
[18:32.660 --> 18:35.660]  and nobody wants tobacco terps in their concentrates.
[18:35.660 --> 18:37.660]  So stop smoking blunts in your grow room.
[18:37.660 --> 18:40.660]  Stop smoking anything in your grow room.
[18:40.660 --> 18:41.660]  Go outside.
[18:41.660 --> 18:42.660]  Go smoke outside.
[18:42.660 --> 18:43.660]  Go to the can of Canyon.
[18:43.660 --> 18:44.660]  Go smoke at the can of Canyon.
[18:44.660 --> 18:46.660]  Go smoke at the dab table.
[18:46.660 --> 18:47.660]  Just don't smoke in the grow room.
[18:47.660 --> 18:48.660]  It's not good for your plants.
[18:48.660 --> 18:50.660]  And quit smoking cigarettes and tobacco anyway.
[18:50.660 --> 18:52.660]  Let's just get down on cannabis, you guys.
[18:52.660 --> 18:54.660]  Organic cannabis.
[18:54.660 --> 18:55.660]  All right.
[18:55.660 --> 19:02.660]  I've been talking for nearly 19 minutes, so I think it's time for me to press pause, take a drink, take a fat dab, and I will be right back.
[19:02.660 --> 19:03.660]  Hang tight.
[19:04.660 --> 19:05.660]  All right, you guys.
[19:05.660 --> 19:06.660]  I am back.
[19:06.660 --> 19:08.660]  I took a couple of fat dabs, and I got a nice drink.
[19:08.660 --> 19:16.660]  While I was taking a drink, I was drinking some kombucha, some GT's Kombucha Organic and Raw Original with enzymes and probiotics.
[19:16.660 --> 19:20.660]  And it reminded me that a listener recently asked me a question about probiotics.
[19:20.660 --> 19:22.660]  He asked me if I could recommend a brand.
[19:22.660 --> 19:24.660]  He asked about a specific brand.
[19:24.660 --> 19:28.660]  Honestly, what I like is the brand Raw Probiotics.
[19:28.660 --> 19:34.660]  You can buy specific blends for men or women or for older folks or for children.
[19:34.660 --> 19:37.660]  So I'm pretty sure that the person that emailed me was a dude.
[19:37.660 --> 19:40.660]  So I would recommend the Raw Probiotics for men.
[19:40.660 --> 19:42.660]  They're available at most health food stores.
[19:42.660 --> 19:45.660]  Those are the probiotics I would support.
[19:45.660 --> 19:48.660]  Now let's talk more about cannabis-related stuff.
[19:48.660 --> 19:53.660]  Somebody recently sent me a message asking me if I think holding in your smoke gets you higher.
[19:53.660 --> 20:01.660]  If you take a dab, if you take a bong rip, if you smoke a joint, do you feel like holding your hit, holding your smoke in your lungs gives you a better buzz?
[20:01.660 --> 20:03.660]  In my opinion, I'm going to say I'm not a doctor.
[20:03.660 --> 20:05.660]  Let me put that out there straight up.
[20:05.660 --> 20:06.660]  I'm not a doctor.
[20:06.660 --> 20:07.660]  This is my stoner opinion.
[20:07.660 --> 20:14.660]  I feel like when I take a dab, I feel like most of what I'm going to get goes into my lungs pretty quickly.
[20:14.660 --> 20:20.660]  Within probably three seconds at the most, maybe five seconds, I have absorbed everything that that dab is going to give me.
[20:21.660 --> 20:22.660]  So I get it in.
[20:22.660 --> 20:24.660]  I let it sit for about a half a second, maybe a second.
[20:24.660 --> 20:25.660]  I pull in the dab.
[20:27.660 --> 20:28.660]  And then I blow it back out.
[20:28.660 --> 20:31.660]  It's only in me for just a brief second just so that I can feel it in there.
[20:31.660 --> 20:32.660]  Then I push it back out.
[20:32.660 --> 20:36.660]  I feel like when you keep the smoke in your lungs is when it's going to cause problems.
[20:36.660 --> 20:40.660]  I feel like my lungs absorb everything they're going to get really quickly.
[20:40.660 --> 20:45.660]  If I keep that smoke in there, I'm going to start absorbing the tars and the soot and the extra crap.
[20:45.660 --> 20:47.660]  The smoke is going to stick to my lungs, and I don't want that.
[20:47.660 --> 20:48.660]  I want to get the cannabinoids.
[20:48.660 --> 20:49.660]  I want the THC.
[20:49.660 --> 20:51.660]  I want the CBD, the CBG.
[20:51.660 --> 20:55.660]  I want the good medical benefits, not the bad part of the smoke.
[20:55.660 --> 21:00.660]  So I think taking a big fat dab and holding it in, you might not get higher.
[21:00.660 --> 21:06.660]  I think you're just getting a head rush from lack of oxygen, and you're just feeling a rush because you're not giving yourself any air.
[21:06.660 --> 21:13.660]  And also, I feel like that pressure, having your lungs inflated like that, is probably very strenuous on your lungs.
[21:13.660 --> 21:15.660]  You could probably hurt yourself by doing that.
[21:16.660 --> 21:20.660]  And then those people that take in a big hit, and they cough, and they try not to cough and hold in the big hit.
[21:20.660 --> 21:24.660]  You make this noise, you start doing that shit.
[21:24.660 --> 21:26.660]  I really feel like that's going to blow something up in your body.
[21:26.660 --> 21:27.660]  You're going to rupture the lung.
[21:27.660 --> 21:29.660]  You're going to fucking blow a blood vessel in your brain.
[21:29.660 --> 21:31.660]  I think you need to get the smoke in and out.
[21:31.660 --> 21:33.660]  I don't think smoke needs to sit around in your lungs.
[21:33.660 --> 21:35.660]  That is my opinion.
[21:35.660 --> 21:36.660]  I don't think you get higher from it.
[21:36.660 --> 21:38.660]  I don't think you're going to absorb more from it.
[21:38.660 --> 21:40.660]  I think that's going to happen almost instantly.
[21:41.660 --> 21:47.660]  I think you're just putting yourself at risk for COPD or other lung problems in the future.
[21:47.660 --> 21:50.660]  I want to elaborate on this a little bit.
[21:50.660 --> 21:55.660]  One thing that I think happens, I take ginormous dabs sometimes.
[21:55.660 --> 21:57.660]  I like to take a big fat dab.
[21:57.660 --> 21:59.660]  The other day, I took a two-gram dab.
[21:59.660 --> 22:00.660]  I didn't cough.
[22:00.660 --> 22:01.660]  Let me be clear.
[22:01.660 --> 22:08.660]  I'm not able to put two grams on the nail and pull it all into my lungs in one draw because I just can't get the...
[22:08.660 --> 22:12.660]  I would have to put the nail really hot to get it to burn or vaporize that quickly.
[22:12.660 --> 22:16.660]  I am taking multiple inhalations, but I'm not taking a break.
[22:16.660 --> 22:20.660]  I'm dropping two grams, one and a half to two grams of dabs on the nail.
[22:20.660 --> 22:22.660]  Just drop it right on there.
[22:22.660 --> 22:29.660]  You got to slowly stir it into the nail and let it melt into there and then carb cap it and just start sucking on that rig.
[22:29.660 --> 22:31.660]  Pull in a big fat hit, blow it out.
[22:31.660 --> 22:32.660]  Pull in another rip, blow it out.
[22:32.660 --> 22:37.660]  Sometimes, it'll take me three or four full inhalations, a full lung expand in and out of my lungs.
[22:38.660 --> 22:40.660]  But I'll smoke two grams in one dab.
[22:40.660 --> 22:41.660]  I call that one dab.
[22:41.660 --> 22:42.660]  That is one dab.
[22:42.660 --> 22:45.660]  I didn't take a break or anything, but it wasn't all one rip.
[22:45.660 --> 22:54.660]  I feel like I can feel the hash coat my lungs, and I feel like I'm kind of giving myself a time-release medicine.
[22:54.660 --> 23:03.660]  I'm smoking so much hash in one quick time period that I am coating my lungs with enough oil to where my body can't absorb it all at once,
[23:03.660 --> 23:05.660]  but there's nowhere for it to go.
[23:05.660 --> 23:07.660]  So all this oil kind of hangs out.
[23:07.660 --> 23:13.660]  All this hash is just hanging out stuck to my lung, and as my body can absorb it, that hash is right there.
[23:13.660 --> 23:20.660]  So my lungs are just sucking up that hash oil the whole time, and I'm just absorbing those cannabinoids and absorbing those medicinal qualities.
[23:20.660 --> 23:25.660]  So I'm giving myself a time-release medication by taking these ginormous dabs.
[23:25.660 --> 23:26.660]  That's something I think is happening.
[23:26.660 --> 23:29.660]  I have no science to that, but I feel like I stay high.
[23:29.660 --> 23:31.660]  I stay getting high.
[23:31.660 --> 23:36.660]  I just keep getting higher and higher and higher as it goes, and sometimes I won't have smoked for a full hour,
[23:36.660 --> 23:47.660]  and I'll still be fully medicated because I think that layer of dab that is coated in my lungs is just being absorbed by my body slowly and getting into my bloodstream.
[23:47.660 --> 23:49.660]  So that's my elaboration.
[23:49.660 --> 23:50.660]  I hope I answered your question.
[23:50.660 --> 23:52.660]  My opinion, holding smoke is a bad idea.
[23:52.660 --> 23:53.660]  You don't need to hold it in.
[23:53.660 --> 23:54.660]  Don't be cheap.
[23:54.660 --> 23:55.660]  Take another dab.
[23:55.660 --> 23:56.660]  Breathe it in.
[23:56.660 --> 23:57.660]  Blow it out.
[23:57.660 --> 23:58.660]  Take another damn dab.
[23:58.660 --> 23:59.660]  I got another dab for you.
[23:59.660 --> 24:03.660]  I think your lungs only get so much use before they wear out.
[24:03.660 --> 24:07.660]  I think you get so many inhales and exhales of your lungs before they're just going to tire out.
[24:07.660 --> 24:10.660]  So don't wear your lungs out by holding in smoke.
[24:10.660 --> 24:11.660]  Just blow it out.
[24:11.660 --> 24:12.660]  Get it out of there.
[24:12.660 --> 24:13.660]  That's my opinion.
[24:13.660 --> 24:14.660]  Let's see.
[24:14.660 --> 24:17.660]  I got a couple more things I want to talk about, and then we're going to wrap up this podcast.
[24:17.660 --> 24:19.660]  Here's something random.
[24:19.660 --> 24:21.660]  You guys, wear some protective eyewear in your garden.
[24:21.660 --> 24:23.660]  The lights are bright.
[24:23.660 --> 24:28.660]  If you're running more than four, maybe five or six lights in there, you need to get yourself some Method 7 glasses and protect your eyes.
[24:29.660 --> 24:31.660]  Also, protect your skin.
[24:31.660 --> 24:38.660]  If you're in a room with 10 or more lights and you're in there for more than a few hours a day, it's a good idea to wear some sort of long sleeves.
[24:38.660 --> 24:39.660]  Keep your head covered.
[24:39.660 --> 24:41.660]  Keep your eyes covered.
[24:41.660 --> 24:45.660]  I believe that those lights are not good for your skin.
[24:45.660 --> 24:46.660]  The sun gives us cancer.
[24:46.660 --> 24:49.660]  Why won't these artificial lights give us some sort of skin problems?
[24:49.660 --> 24:54.660]  You guys, I highly recommend covering up your skin and your eyes if you're in a grow room all day long.
[24:55.660 --> 25:00.660]  I wear my Method 7 glasses from the minute I walk into the grow room to the minute I walk out.
[25:00.660 --> 25:01.660]  I've got the Method 7s on.
[25:01.660 --> 25:03.660]  I like to wear a long sleeve shirt in the grow room.
[25:03.660 --> 25:06.660]  It gets kind of hot, but it's still worth wearing a long sleeve shirt.
[25:06.660 --> 25:08.660]  Also, here's something really random.
[25:08.660 --> 25:15.660]  When you're in the grow room, if you've got a bunch of sticks, if you're using sticks in there to support your plants, watch your eyes around those sticks.
[25:15.660 --> 25:21.660]  I saw somebody bend over the other day to take care of a plant, and if he wasn't paying attention, that stick would have gone way far into his eye.
[25:21.660 --> 25:22.660]  It kind of poked his eye.
[25:22.660 --> 25:24.660]  It didn't hurt him because he saw it coming.
[25:24.660 --> 25:26.660]  He saw it because it literally went into his eye.
[25:26.660 --> 25:30.660]  He was kneeling down, put the stick right into his eye, didn't fuck him up.
[25:30.660 --> 25:31.660]  He survived.
[25:31.660 --> 25:35.660]  He'll be just fine, but I don't want that to happen to any of my listeners or any of my friends.
[25:35.660 --> 25:37.660]  So be very aware of those sticks in your grow room.
[25:37.660 --> 25:38.660]  I don't use the sticks.
[25:38.660 --> 25:40.660]  I use my personal grow.
[25:40.660 --> 25:42.660]  I like a tomato cage.
[25:42.660 --> 25:45.660]  In the commercial grow, we like to use the big trellis nets.
[25:45.660 --> 25:51.660]  Of course, I have used the sticks before, and I'll probably use them again, but that's not my preferred method at this time.
[25:51.660 --> 25:56.660]  And if you were using them, I do recommend that you watch your eyes.
[25:56.660 --> 26:00.660]  And since I'm talking about grow room safety, here's another thing you should think about.
[26:00.660 --> 26:08.660]  You should have a smoke detector inside of each grow room, and you should also have a fire extinguisher on the exterior of each grow room.
[26:08.660 --> 26:14.660]  Don't put your fire extinguisher inside the grow room because if there is a problem in there, you don't want to have to kick down the door.
[26:14.660 --> 26:17.660]  Go in there and get your fire extinguisher and try to put the fire out.
[26:17.660 --> 26:24.660]  You want that fire extinguisher on the outside by the door so that if something's wrong, you can kick the door down, spray the fuck out of that fire, solve the problem.
[26:24.660 --> 26:29.660]  So smoke detectors and fire extinguishers are a big advantage for your grow.
[26:29.660 --> 26:31.660]  Put that shit in there.
[26:31.660 --> 26:32.660]  Keep yourself safe.
[26:32.660 --> 26:35.660]  All right, guys, I think that's all I've got for this podcast.
[26:35.660 --> 26:38.660]  Pretty soon, I've got Jesse coming back for another outdoor grow lesson.
[26:38.660 --> 26:40.660]  Jesse, if you're listening, it is time.
[26:40.660 --> 26:41.660]  You can bring the boys.
[26:41.660 --> 26:42.660]  We could do a swap cast.
[26:42.660 --> 26:50.660]  If you don't know what a swap cast is, I'm going to tell you, Jesse and 44 and Dirty D, they have a podcast called the Colorado podcast.
[26:50.660 --> 26:52.660]  I want to have them come on here.
[26:52.660 --> 26:56.660]  All three of them will record one podcast, and we will both put it out on our feeds.
[26:56.660 --> 27:00.660]  So we'll do a Colorado grow from your heart podcast combination.
[27:00.660 --> 27:01.660]  We'll talk about growing dope.
[27:01.660 --> 27:08.660]  We'll talk about Colorado life, and then we'll both put it up on our feeds, and I'll expose my audience to the Colorado podcast.
[27:08.660 --> 27:12.660]  The Colorado podcast will expose their audience to myself and the grow from your heart podcast.
[27:12.660 --> 27:13.660]  It'll be good for everybody.
[27:13.660 --> 27:15.660]  So in the future, we'll get Jesse and the crew on here.
[27:15.660 --> 27:18.660]  If you guys are listening, this is the invitation.
[27:18.660 --> 27:19.660]  I want to get you here.
[27:19.660 --> 27:23.660]  Also, it is time to get Mike and Lindsey back so we can talk a little bit more about politics.
[27:23.660 --> 27:25.660]  If you two are listening, start doing your homework.
[27:25.660 --> 27:26.660]  Get an episode prepared.
[27:26.660 --> 27:28.660]  We'll get you back on here.
[27:28.660 --> 27:30.660]  You guys, that's all I have got for you.
[27:30.660 --> 27:34.660]  What I would appreciate is if you go to iTunes, find the iTunes store, search for the grow from your heart podcast.
[27:34.660 --> 27:36.660]  Give me a rating that you feel I deserve.
[27:36.660 --> 27:37.660]  I'm not even asking for five stars.
[27:37.660 --> 27:39.660]  I want you to go and click what you feel I deserve.
[27:39.660 --> 27:41.660]  After that, type in a comment.
[27:41.660 --> 27:45.660]  Let me know what you think of the show, and I will read your comments on a future episode.
[27:45.660 --> 27:51.660]  If you've got a product you'd like me to review or if you would like to sponsor the podcast, all you've got to do is send me an email.
[27:51.660 --> 27:52.660]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:52.660 --> 27:55.660]  I'll get you all of the information that you do need.
[27:55.660 --> 27:58.660]  I would love it if you'd follow me on all of the social media.
[27:58.660 --> 27:59.660]  I am on Facebook.
[27:59.660 --> 28:01.660]  You can find me at the grow from your heart podcast on Facebook.
[28:01.660 --> 28:04.660]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[28:04.660 --> 28:07.660]  On Instagram, I am using the seed company name.
[28:07.660 --> 28:09.660]  It's IRIE underscore genetics.
[28:09.660 --> 28:14.660]  I recently signed up for a new app known as Green Door.
[28:14.660 --> 28:19.660]  It is a cannabis-based app where we post cannabis articles, photography, cannabis news.
[28:19.660 --> 28:21.660]  Make sure you check out the Green Door app.
[28:21.660 --> 28:24.660]  When you sign up, make sure you use my name as a referral code.
[28:24.660 --> 28:30.660]  It's IRIE underscore genetics, and I will get some bonus points on the Green Door app.
[28:30.660 --> 28:31.660]  Make sure you sign up.
[28:31.660 --> 28:32.660]  Check it out.
[28:32.660 --> 28:35.660]  Shout out to my friend Emily for getting me involved in the Green Door app.
[28:35.660 --> 28:36.660]  I appreciate it.
[28:36.660 --> 28:39.660]  I think that's all I have got for you this week.
[28:39.660 --> 28:41.660]  I want to give a big shout out to my ninja spence.
[28:41.660 --> 28:42.660]  Thanks again for listening.
[28:42.660 --> 28:46.660]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[28:47.660 --> 29:17.780]  That's the way you spin.
[29:17.780 --> 29:26.010]  Hey baby, show the girl over there.
[29:26.010 --> 29:29.010]  Put the hot pants on.
[29:29.010 --> 29:32.010]  Turn the loose, Jane Brown.
[29:32.010 --> 29:35.010]  Let her turn me on.
[29:35.010 --> 29:38.010]  It's me and you, baby.
[29:38.010 --> 29:41.010]  We're hand in hand.
[29:41.010 --> 29:44.010]  I'm a man, you're the ball-legged woman.
[29:44.010 --> 30:04.410]  And I'm a knob meat man.
[30:04.410 --> 30:32.500]  In my room, make love to you.
[30:32.500 --> 30:38.180]  Make love to you.
[30:38.180 --> 30:41.180]  Make love to you.
[30:41.180 --> 30:46.180]  In my room, me and you.
[30:46.180 --> 30:52.760]  In my room, in my room.
[31:10.230 --> 31:13.230]  In my room, in my room.
