[00:00.000 --> 00:04.560]  Welcome to the show, everybody. It's time for episode 368 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:04.560 --> 00:09.440]  podcast. This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you need fresh
[00:09.440 --> 00:13.880]  genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can find
[00:13.880 --> 00:21.200]  them at www.dankseed.store. I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I
[00:21.200 --> 00:25.780]  am smoking on. Today, I've been taking dabs of Screamin' Watermelon from our friends at
[00:25.780 --> 00:30.440]  Viola Extracts. This stuff has a really nice flavor. If you dab it too hot, you totally
[00:30.440 --> 00:35.420]  kill that sweet watermelon flavor. If you go in nice and cool, it has a sweet watermelon
[00:35.420 --> 00:42.900]  Jolly Rancher sort of flavor, and I really like it. The label here says it is 94.5% THC-A
[00:42.900 --> 00:51.520]  and 0% CBD or CBG for a total of 82.88% THC. That's a pretty impressive lab test for something
[00:51.520 --> 00:56.200]  with so much flavor. So big shout out to the Screamin' Watermelon from Viola Extracts,
[00:56.200 --> 01:00.160]  and also big shout out to my friends at the Colorado Cannabis Exchange for taking good
[01:00.160 --> 01:01.160]  care of me.
[01:01.160 --> 01:05.100]  All right, before I take us into the grow lesson, I want to give you guys an update
[01:05.100 --> 01:10.960]  on my web store. I have added some new merchandise to my website. There are new Iry Army t-shirts,
[01:10.960 --> 01:15.160]  there are Iry Genetics t-shirts, there are Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirts, there
[01:15.160 --> 01:19.760]  are Iry Genetics hoodies, and there are Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodies all available
[01:19.760 --> 01:26.000]  on the website, plus a plethora of great stickers. So make sure you check out the website,
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.040]  irygeneticscolorado.com. Grab yourself some shirts, grab yourself some stickers, get a
[01:30.040 --> 01:34.800]  hoodie for the winter, get yourself all styled out with the fresh new Iry Genetics gear.
[01:34.800 --> 01:39.760]  All right, you guys, let's work on a podcast. This is going to be another grow lesson. I
[01:39.760 --> 01:43.840]  hope you have been following along with my long series of grow lessons. We started off
[01:43.840 --> 01:48.360]  by selecting a goal for our grow. We worked on selecting a proper space. We built a good
[01:48.360 --> 01:53.440]  grow room. We decided if we wanted to grow from seeds or clones. We acquired seeds and
[01:53.440 --> 01:58.240]  clones. We have got them sprouted. Now they are potted into their little pots. I think
[01:58.240 --> 02:02.960]  by this time, all of our seeds and clones should be about the same size. We've got stuff
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.920]  in either a four-inch pot or a six-inch net pot, and we should have clones or seedlings
[02:07.920 --> 02:12.440]  with just a few sets of leaves. They're probably four, maybe six inches tall by now, and that
[02:12.440 --> 02:19.080]  is what I call small veg. So let's do a podcast about the small vegetative phase of growing
[02:19.080 --> 02:24.800]  your cannabis garden. In my opinion, the vegetative phase of growing cannabis is often the most
[02:24.800 --> 02:29.760]  overlooked phase of growing. People think they need to invest all of their time, energy,
[02:29.760 --> 02:34.600]  and money on the flowering process. That is very important, but I like to believe that
[02:34.600 --> 02:40.000]  you can't build a strong building without a solid foundation, and that foundation starts
[02:40.040 --> 02:45.280]  in the veg phase. By the time we get these plants to the flowering room, we need them
[02:45.280 --> 02:49.280]  to be healthy. We need them to be robust. We need them the shape we want them. We need
[02:49.280 --> 02:54.720]  them the structure we want them, and we need them pest and pathogen-free. My main focus
[02:54.720 --> 03:00.080]  during the small vegetative stage is to develop a strong root system for these plants. I want
[03:00.080 --> 03:04.240]  to get those roots thick and busting out of that pot before I transplant them into their
[03:04.240 --> 03:10.080]  forever homes. My second goal is to keep these plants pest and pathogen-free. Now if
[03:10.080 --> 03:15.800]  I'm working from seeds, I'm also paying attention for issues, mutations, problems, whatever
[03:15.800 --> 03:20.000]  a seedling may show you. A seedling has a ton of options that can occur through the
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.040]  entire growth cycle. You need to pay special attention to your seedlings. If you're growing
[03:24.040 --> 03:29.200]  from clones, you should know what to expect. So my main focus during this small vegetative
[03:29.200 --> 03:35.520]  phase is developing a strong root system. My second priority is maintaining clean, healthy
[03:35.520 --> 03:39.440]  plants. I don't want any bugs and I don't need any pathogens. Then my third priority,
[03:39.440 --> 03:43.480]  if I'm growing from seeds, I want to pay close attention to those seedlings and I want to
[03:43.480 --> 03:48.560]  keep my eye out for any weird mutations or weird problems. Now if things go right, we
[03:48.560 --> 03:54.080]  are only going to spend two to four weeks in these small pots in our small veg phase,
[03:54.080 --> 03:59.360]  but in my opinion, this phase is equally as important as the flowering process. We
[03:59.360 --> 04:04.760]  need to treat every step of the grow process as an important process. We all want to focus
[04:04.760 --> 04:09.520]  on that flowering phase. We all get excited around week four. We get super pumped up at
[04:09.520 --> 04:14.000]  week five. By week six, you're just ecstatic. Week seven and eight, you can't wait to cut
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.400]  it down. By week nine, you're in there every single day taking pictures, looking at the
[04:18.400 --> 04:22.000]  plants, hoping you can cut them down today or tomorrow, just trying to be patient. Why
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.400]  don't we put that much energy into the starting phase of our plants? I know they're not as
[04:26.400 --> 04:30.000]  pretty. There's nothing to show for it, but it is just as important.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.400]  Now let's get a little deeper into this small veg phase. What makes this small veg? What
[04:35.400 --> 04:39.520]  makes it small veg is my plants are small. They are in small pots. Now what makes it
[04:39.520 --> 04:45.800]  veg? Veg is the light cycle. Cannabis plants are triggered by the light cycle. If they
[04:45.800 --> 04:50.040]  have enough light, they will not flower. Once we reduce the light to approximately 12 hours
[04:50.040 --> 04:54.400]  on and 12 hours off every day, that triggers our plants to flower. They think that the
[04:54.400 --> 04:57.800]  fall is coming. They think it's the end of the season. They start doing their end of
[04:57.800 --> 05:03.160]  season business, which is producing flowers. The parts that we call buds are the cannabis
[05:03.160 --> 05:08.000]  flowers. They are dried flower tops from a cannabis plant. That is induced by changing
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.760]  the light cycle. Until we manipulate that light cycle, we are in veg. Since we are using
[05:13.760 --> 05:18.120]  small pots and have small plants, once again, we are back to small.
[05:18.200 --> 05:22.240]  Now let's talk a little bit about these light cycles. We have got plenty of options for
[05:22.240 --> 05:28.440]  light cycles in our veg phase. From what I have experienced, the most common and most
[05:28.440 --> 05:36.740]  popular veg light schedule is 18 hours on and 16 hours off in a daily 24-hour cycle.
[05:36.740 --> 05:43.000]  There are other options. You can go 24 hours on and 0 hours off. I have seen great success
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.600]  with 2 hours of darkness. That's 22 hours on and 2 hours off every day. In a commercial
[05:48.600 --> 05:55.440]  facility, in a mother room, and in a veg room, I am known to do 20 hours on and 4 hours off.
[05:55.440 --> 05:59.640]  Now I mentioned the 18-6. That is kind of a classic. That's really close to what nature
[05:59.640 --> 06:06.520]  does. Also, there is the 16 on and 8 hours off. All of these have their advantages. Also,
[06:06.520 --> 06:12.360]  they all have their disadvantage. What is the advantage of 24 hours and 0 hours of darkness?
[06:12.720 --> 06:18.440]  24 hours of light means your plants are getting 24 hours of light energy. I usually recommend
[06:18.440 --> 06:24.960]  a 24-hour on cycle only for clones and tiny plants or if you are revegging. Sometimes
[06:24.960 --> 06:28.480]  we have mother plants that if they get root bound or if they don't get enough light or
[06:28.480 --> 06:33.200]  if they don't get the proper energy, they will decide to auto flower on you over time.
[06:33.200 --> 06:37.640]  I like to keep those plants under 24 hours of light. That does prevent them from flipping
[06:37.640 --> 06:41.740]  themselves into flower because of another environmental factor.
[06:41.740 --> 06:45.460]  Most of the time, I would not recommend a 24-hour light cycle unless you are cutting
[06:45.460 --> 06:50.100]  clones or you're trying to reveg or perhaps you've got a mother plant that gets temperamental
[06:50.100 --> 06:55.740]  and wants to try to auto flower on you. I like the 20 on and 4 off for a commercial
[06:55.740 --> 07:00.540]  environment. I like a little bit of dark cycle. I think every living thing likes a little
[07:00.540 --> 07:04.780]  bit of dark cycle. I think roots develop in the dark. I think the plants like a little
[07:04.780 --> 07:11.300]  rest. Also, that is 4 hours of electricity not being sucked up. If you've got one light,
[07:11.300 --> 07:15.980]  you're saving a little bit of money. If you've got 50 lights, you are saving a lot of money.
[07:15.980 --> 07:21.260]  That is 200 light hours that you are not running right there. That's 200,000 watt light hours
[07:21.260 --> 07:23.900]  that you don't have to pay for if you've got a larger facility.
[07:23.900 --> 07:29.180]  20 hours on, 4 hours off is always great for a commercial facility. You can keep your mother
[07:29.180 --> 07:32.520]  plants in that room. You can keep your small veg in that room. You can keep your large
[07:32.520 --> 07:37.180]  veg in that room. Usually, I put the clones in that same room underneath the T5 light
[07:37.180 --> 07:40.300]  in the corner so there's just a little bit of light in the room. It doesn't really bother
[07:40.300 --> 07:43.300]  the rest of the plants. They're able to do their thing. That T5 doesn't do much in a
[07:43.300 --> 07:45.220]  giant veg room in a commercial facility.
[07:45.220 --> 07:49.760]  Now, I always like to mention the downside of what I'm talking about. There's not much
[07:49.760 --> 07:55.840]  of a downside to a 20 on and 4 off cycle. I guess really the only downside is that you're
[07:55.840 --> 08:00.460]  always running lights. You only get 4 hours of darkness compared to my next method, which
[08:00.460 --> 08:06.900]  is an 18 on and 6 hour off everyday cycle. A lot of growers prefer this because it is
[08:06.900 --> 08:11.700]  closer to the natural cycles of life. It is closer to the natural rhythms of the sun
[08:11.700 --> 08:15.980]  outside. It's a little closer to the natural circadian rhythm that our plants would be
[08:15.980 --> 08:21.100]  subject to in their normal environment. It just feels a little more natural in general.
[08:21.100 --> 08:27.420]  The pros to an 18-6 cycle is it feels pretty natural to you and the plants. It also saves
[08:27.420 --> 08:31.860]  you quite a bit of electricity having a 6 hour night cycle. That is 6 hours that you
[08:31.860 --> 08:36.880]  don't have your lights on. That's 6 hours you don't have to cool the room as much. Multiply
[08:36.880 --> 08:41.440]  that by however many lights you've got and you start saving more and more money. I also
[08:41.440 --> 08:46.620]  think the plants really enjoy a nice 6 hour nap. You can see a lot of productivity from
[08:46.620 --> 08:48.880]  that 6 hour nap that the plants get.
[08:48.880 --> 08:56.620]  Now, our next option is a 16-8 cycle that is very similar to the 18-6, but some plants
[08:56.620 --> 09:02.840]  will show you some differences. Some plants may try to flower under that 16-8 cycle if
[09:02.840 --> 09:06.920]  they get root bound, if they become nutrient deficient, if there are any environmental
[09:06.920 --> 09:13.160]  factors that stress those plants, they may decide to flower on you underneath that 16-8
[09:13.160 --> 09:17.980]  light cycle. Depending on what part of the globe your plants originate from, they may
[09:17.980 --> 09:23.640]  have a different critical period. Let me explain the critical period. The critical period is
[09:23.640 --> 09:29.780]  the amount of dark hours a plant needs to induce its flowering cycle. Some plants will
[09:29.780 --> 09:36.300]  flower with a 14 hour dark cycle. Some plants will flower with a 10 hour dark cycle. The
[09:36.300 --> 09:40.820]  reason we go for that 12 on 12 off is it's right in the middle and it seems to work well
[09:40.820 --> 09:45.020]  with most of the plants that we have bred for our indoor environment. Now, since some
[09:45.020 --> 09:49.480]  plants come from north of the equator and some plants come from south of the equator,
[09:49.480 --> 09:54.500]  we do have different flowering times. In tropical areas, those plants can flower for much longer
[09:54.500 --> 09:59.140]  because they're not going to get snowed on. Also, in those areas, we don't get as drastic
[09:59.140 --> 10:03.380]  of a day and night cycle change. There may be as much as one hour difference between
[10:03.380 --> 10:09.140]  your summer and your winter day period. In other areas, we get winter, we get snow, we
[10:09.140 --> 10:14.780]  get dumped on, and we get long dark periods. So our plants have evolved and adapted and
[10:14.780 --> 10:19.020]  climatized themselves to those regions. Then we have bred with those plants and we've created
[10:19.020 --> 10:24.180]  hybrids and brought them indoors. Indoors, some of our plants will flower with a 10 hour
[10:24.180 --> 10:29.300]  dark period. Indoors, some of our plants will flower with a 12 hour dark period. We
[10:29.300 --> 10:33.820]  have established that 12 on and 12 off seems to work really well for most of the plants
[10:33.820 --> 10:38.700]  that we have bred. Now, to prevent them from flowering early, we like to use an extended
[10:38.700 --> 10:42.980]  light cycle. That's where we put them on 16 hours on at a minimum. That way we know they
[10:42.980 --> 10:47.980]  are not going to flower. I like to go that 18 hours because why not give them two more
[10:47.980 --> 10:53.260]  full hours of energy every day? Light is the number one desired nutrient from our plants.
[10:53.260 --> 10:57.340]  Light is the number one desired factor for growth from our plants. So why not give it
[10:57.340 --> 11:02.620]  that extra two hours? Now in my mind, I say, why not give it that full 20 hours every day
[11:02.620 --> 11:07.260]  so that we can get maximum growth and give our plants a four hour nap every day? I think
[11:07.260 --> 11:13.460]  it works really well. Now, another reason I like the 20 on and four off is I find that
[11:13.460 --> 11:18.740]  when I move my plants into the flowering room and I take them from a 20 hour day to a 12
[11:18.740 --> 11:24.620]  hour day, they induce flowering very quickly. In other facilities where I'm running shorter
[11:24.620 --> 11:28.620]  veg periods, I noticed they take a little longer for the plants to start popping up
[11:28.620 --> 11:33.780]  bud set. The little pre-flowers, the little pistils don't start popping up as early as
[11:33.780 --> 11:39.020]  if I were to run those plants on a long day cycle and then kick that 12, 12 right away.
[11:39.020 --> 11:43.260]  I feel like the plants go, oh shit, it is time to flower. We have really had a reduction
[11:43.260 --> 11:49.180]  in daylight. They know it. So that's why I do 20 on and four off in my veg and mom
[11:49.180 --> 11:55.980]  area. Of course, I'm running, sometimes I've got 50 or 75 different cultivars in a mom
[11:55.980 --> 12:00.900]  room. So I've really got to keep things happy. And I found that the 20 on and four off prevents
[12:00.900 --> 12:05.700]  anything from auto flowering. And again, it really triggers that flowering when I put
[12:05.700 --> 12:11.660]  them into the 12, 12 room. So those are the basic veg schedules I would recommend. 24,
[12:11.820 --> 12:16.620]  20 and four, 18 and six or 16 and eight. I wouldn't go much lower than that. You may
[12:16.620 --> 12:21.420]  notice problems. You won't have the desired robust vegetative growth that you need. And
[12:21.420 --> 12:26.020]  also you may get plants that decide to flower before you're ready. All right. I feel like
[12:26.020 --> 12:30.420]  we know how long to leave the light on. Now let's talk about what kind of light to put
[12:30.420 --> 12:35.140]  these plants under. We don't have to throw these small plants under the Govita lights
[12:35.140 --> 12:39.260]  right away. We may crisp them up. We may roast them. They may not be prepared for that. So
[12:39.260 --> 12:45.580]  I like to start my small plants under smaller lights. In most situations, I think a T5 would
[12:45.580 --> 12:51.940]  work for most people. In most commercial environments, I use the three foot long T5 fixtures. They're
[12:51.940 --> 12:56.160]  three feet long. They have eight bulbs. I feel like you can fit quite a few small veg
[12:56.160 --> 13:02.440]  plants under those. In a commercial environment, I like to set up a two tiered veg system.
[13:02.440 --> 13:08.180]  I get a Uline rack. I put plants on the bottom shelf of that Uline rack. I hang a light underneath
[13:08.180 --> 13:13.060]  the top shelf to light those plants. Now I've got that top shelf freed up. I put plants
[13:13.060 --> 13:17.540]  up there and I hang a light from the ceiling. Now I've got two layers of plants and I'm
[13:17.540 --> 13:24.500]  maximizing my space by using a two tiered veg system. I like to use a T5 fixture for
[13:24.500 --> 13:28.120]  the plants on the bottom shelf. And then for the plants on the top shelf, I either use
[13:28.120 --> 13:32.780]  a Govita or a metal halide, either somewhere between a four and a thousand watt, depending
[13:32.780 --> 13:36.960]  on my space, depending on my environment, depending on how far from those plants I am.
[13:36.960 --> 13:42.000]  But those small veg plants start off on the bottom shelf under the T5s. Then as I transplant,
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.640]  I move them up to the top shelf and they go underneath the metal halides. Sometimes those
[13:45.640 --> 13:51.360]  are Govitas. It just depends again on my environment. Now I really find the T5s to be cost effective.
[13:51.360 --> 13:55.600]  I think they're efficient and I think they do a great job. If you want to invest a little
[13:55.600 --> 14:02.600]  more money on a better light, I have seen great success vegging underneath LED lighting.
[14:02.600 --> 14:08.040]  Small plants really love LED lights and also those LEDs don't produce much heat and they
[14:08.040 --> 14:12.680]  don't use a lot of electricity. They are a little pricey up front, but I think they are
[14:12.680 --> 14:18.080]  worth the money if you get a quality LED. I personally don't have much experience with
[14:18.080 --> 14:24.280]  LED lighting, but I have seen great things from LED lights in small veg, in large veg
[14:24.280 --> 14:29.840]  and through flower. The most important thing about an LED in veg is the spectrum. And that's
[14:29.840 --> 14:33.640]  also important when it comes to T5s. Let me back up because I overlooked that part
[14:33.640 --> 14:37.160]  when I was talking about T5s. I do not have any notes on this. This is all coming out
[14:37.160 --> 14:41.880]  of the top of my head today. So let me catch myself before I go too fast. T5 lights are
[14:41.880 --> 14:47.040]  commonly available in two spectrums. Most of the time you will find them in a 3000 Kelvin
[14:47.040 --> 14:54.040]  and a 6400 Kelvin. For your veg phase, I recommend the 6400 Kelvin. They will put off a more
[14:54.040 --> 14:58.880]  blue light, which is what we want for the veg. Later on when we move to flower, we want
[14:58.880 --> 15:04.720]  more of that orange spectrum. So that's when you would switch to the 3000 Kelvin T5 bulbs
[15:04.720 --> 15:08.080]  if you were going to flower under them, which I do not recommend, but they are great for
[15:08.080 --> 15:12.960]  veg. So spectrum is very important and I almost overlooked that. When you were selecting your
[15:12.960 --> 15:19.760]  T5 bulbs, make sure that you get the 6400 Kelvin bulbs. Those are what I would recommend
[15:19.760 --> 15:25.160]  for your veg phase. I also recommend the bluer or whiter spectrum lights when it comes to
[15:25.160 --> 15:29.840]  LEDs. A lot of the new LEDs give you the option to turn on certain boards and turn
[15:29.840 --> 15:34.600]  off certain boards. When you are vegging, you want more of the blue and whiter spectrums.
[15:34.600 --> 15:39.520]  Again, once we turn to flower, that's when we want those orange and red spectrums. So
[15:39.520 --> 15:44.040]  while we're in veg, whatever kind of light you're using, focus more on the white or blue
[15:44.040 --> 15:48.960]  spectrums. So I've got another option for lighting that I can recommend, but I would
[15:48.960 --> 15:55.280]  only suggest this for a very small scale grow environment. Maybe for one or two very
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.680]  small plants, maybe for a cabinet grow or something, this would be an effective grow
[15:59.680 --> 16:05.240]  light in a pinch. I have seen a lot of folks build a small grow cabinet with a compact
[16:05.240 --> 16:12.180]  fluorescent light. Those CFLs, they put off barely any heat and they use barely any electricity.
[16:12.180 --> 16:15.400]  So if you can get enough of them around your plant to feel like you're giving it enough
[16:15.400 --> 16:20.280]  light, the plant will grow. Don't expect huge growth, don't expect robust plants, don't
[16:20.280 --> 16:26.080]  expect a large harvest, but you can make a plant grow with a compact fluorescent light.
[16:26.080 --> 16:30.600]  Of course, the more light, the better, but some people are very limited in space and
[16:30.600 --> 16:35.520]  power and some people only want a small grow for a small personal experiment. So a compact
[16:35.520 --> 16:41.720]  fluorescent light may work for you. That would always be my very last option. Now let's talk
[16:41.720 --> 16:46.760]  about a big boy light. A lot of people are familiar with growing under high intensity
[16:46.760 --> 16:52.700]  discharge lighting. A lot of people are going to flower under an HID light. If we are careful
[16:52.700 --> 16:58.880]  to not roast the plants, a metal halide light will be perfect for your small veg plants.
[16:58.880 --> 17:04.400]  Maybe a 400, maybe a 600, a thousand, maybe overkill unless you keep it a little distance
[17:04.400 --> 17:09.600]  away. You can get a 400 watt light fairly close to your small plants if you keep it
[17:09.600 --> 17:13.520]  cool. If you've got a ducted hood and you're keeping air moving over that light to where
[17:13.520 --> 17:18.520]  none of that heat is making it to your canopy, you can get that 400 watt light fairly close
[17:18.520 --> 17:23.360]  to your plants. Just don't let that heat roast your plants and dehydrate your soil. I would
[17:23.360 --> 17:28.960]  say maybe keep a 400 watt light 18 to 24 inches away from your small plants. The T5s, you
[17:28.960 --> 17:33.200]  can get those T5s six to eight inches away from the plants. The bigger the light, we
[17:33.200 --> 17:37.040]  need to go a little further because it's going to be hotter and more intense and you don't
[17:37.040 --> 17:41.040]  want to have super hot, intense light right in your face all day. You survive from the
[17:41.040 --> 17:45.160]  sun and you're happy with it being real far away. Think about the plants and the light
[17:45.160 --> 17:49.360]  and the sun and yourself having a similar kind of a relationship. You need plenty of
[17:49.360 --> 17:53.320]  it. You don't want anything in the way, but also you don't want to get barbecued.
[17:53.320 --> 17:59.760]  So you can put a 400 watt light 18, 24 inches away, a 600, I would probably go 20, 30 inches
[17:59.760 --> 18:03.480]  away, a thousand watt light. You're going to want to be a few feet away from those small
[18:03.480 --> 18:08.240]  plants. It's going to get hot. It's going to be very intense. But if you've got a 400
[18:08.240 --> 18:12.520]  watt light and it's ducted, which means it's got a duct coming off of each end and you're
[18:12.520 --> 18:16.560]  sucking air through it to move that heat away from that bulb. And you've got glass between
[18:16.560 --> 18:20.680]  the bulb and the canopy. You should be able to run a 400 watt light with very minimal
[18:20.680 --> 18:25.560]  problems if you pay attention to heat and the distance from those plants.
[18:25.560 --> 18:31.080]  All right. I think that pretty much covers our lighting options for our small veg plants.
[18:31.080 --> 18:35.480]  Let's talk a little bit about the environment. Let's talk about the temperature and humidity
[18:35.480 --> 18:41.200]  for these small plants. In my experience, my small plants appear to be happiest when
[18:41.200 --> 18:46.960]  they are somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. I really think they like it about
[18:46.960 --> 18:53.120]  75 degrees to 77 degrees is right about the prime spot for small veg plants. That's when
[18:53.120 --> 18:56.880]  I see the most growth. That's when I see the most production. That's when I see the most
[18:56.880 --> 19:00.800]  root development. That's when I see the happiest plants.
[19:00.800 --> 19:06.720]  So somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees, or if you can dial it in perfectly, 75 to 77
[19:06.720 --> 19:10.840]  is that sweet spot. They really seem to like it right there. Now for that temperature to
[19:10.840 --> 19:15.980]  work perfectly, you need to dial in your humidity. Temperature and humidity work together. There's
[19:15.980 --> 19:20.400]  a math equation. I've done a full episode on it. This creates what is called a vapor
[19:20.400 --> 19:26.280]  pressure deficit. I encourage you to listen to episode 314 and learn about vapor pressure
[19:26.280 --> 19:27.280]  deficit.
[19:27.280 --> 19:31.960]  Now let's talk about humidity. These small plants would like to be in an environment
[19:31.960 --> 19:37.800]  with the humidity somewhere between 50 and 70%. I have noticed that when the humidity
[19:37.800 --> 19:43.080]  is too low, the plants do not produce. There is no production for the whole day when the
[19:43.080 --> 19:47.840]  humidity is too low. The leaves start to droop. The plants don't make any progress. They don't
[19:47.840 --> 19:52.240]  look as robust as they should. The roots are not growing. There's no productivity in that
[19:52.240 --> 19:57.240]  plant and they also start to develop a woody texture on the outside of the stems. So I
[19:57.240 --> 20:02.760]  encourage proper humidity. Too much humidity on the other hand can cause similar problems.
[20:02.760 --> 20:07.120]  It can cause slow growth. It can cause rot. It can encourage powdery mildew. Try to keep
[20:07.120 --> 20:11.720]  the plants happy by giving them the proper conditions. How much better do you perform
[20:11.720 --> 20:15.560]  when you are happy with your conditions? If I made you go do your job, some of you are
[20:15.560 --> 20:19.280]  going to laugh at me because you have to do this. If I made you go do your job outside
[20:19.280 --> 20:23.280]  in 30 degree weather and shorts and a t-shirt, how happy are you going to be? You're not
[20:23.280 --> 20:28.640]  going to get shit done. If I put you in shorts and a t-shirt and put you in a 77 degree room
[20:28.640 --> 20:32.720]  and I dial that humidity back to about 50%, you're going to be completely comfortable
[20:32.720 --> 20:37.480]  in that room and you're going to get a lot done. The plants feel the same about life.
[20:37.480 --> 20:41.560]  If we keep them comfortable and we keep them happy, they're going to produce for us and
[20:41.560 --> 20:46.000]  give us what we want. If we don't keep them happy, if we don't treat them properly, they're
[20:46.000 --> 20:49.120]  not going to give us shit. It's going to be a struggle the entire grow.
[20:49.120 --> 20:54.840]  Again, for temperature, I want somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees. Right around 75 to 77 is
[20:54.840 --> 20:59.320]  that sweet spot from what I have experienced. Then again, with humidity, I like to stay
[20:59.320 --> 21:05.280]  between 50 and 70%. Too low, you start slowing down growth. Too high, you start slowing down
[21:05.280 --> 21:10.000]  growth. That is the temperature and humidity. Again, I highly recommend you go listen to
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.560]  episode 314 and learn all about vapor pressure deficit.
[21:14.280 --> 21:17.800]  All right, you guys, we have talked about lighting. We have talked about environment.
[21:17.800 --> 21:22.160]  I feel like this is going to turn into a long podcast. I'm 20 minutes in. I am going to
[21:22.160 --> 21:25.480]  press pause for a moment. I need to take a drink. Of course, I'm going to take a couple
[21:25.480 --> 21:29.960]  of dabs. I encourage you to dab with me. I will be right back and we will talk about
[21:29.960 --> 21:33.640]  nutrients and feeding our new small veg plants.
[21:33.640 --> 21:38.180]  Hey guys, while I'm taking a couple of dabs, I thought it would be a good opportunity to
[21:38.180 --> 21:42.480]  give thanks to people who have supported the show on Patreon. I want to give a huge thanks
[21:42.520 --> 21:47.800]  to my friend, Sam. How about a giant thanks to Aldridge? A big, giant shout out to Tanner
[21:47.800 --> 21:54.180]  Martinovic, and also a big shout out to Todd Keller. Thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[21:54.180 --> 21:57.100]  If you would like to learn how to support the show on Patreon, all you have to do is
[21:57.100 --> 22:03.520]  go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart and all of the information will be right there.
[22:03.520 --> 22:05.560]  Thanks again for all of the Patreon support.
[22:05.560 --> 22:10.760]  All right, podcast world, I am back. I am well hydrated. I am very well medicated, and
[22:10.760 --> 22:15.720]  I am ready to talk more about our small veg plants. I said we were going to jump into
[22:15.720 --> 22:20.440]  nutrients. I've got one more thing I want to add to our grow environment before we talk
[22:20.440 --> 22:26.940]  about what we are feeding. Let's add a small fan to our grow environment. I want to ruffle
[22:26.940 --> 22:33.000]  each leaf of our small plants as they grow. I don't need the fan blasting the plants constantly.
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.040]  I don't need the fan making the plants bend over. I don't need a whole lot of fan activity.
[22:38.040 --> 22:42.440]  If you've got an oscillating fan, that's perfect. Put it on low and just let it breeze
[22:42.440 --> 22:46.240]  across the canopy of those plants. It's going to make the plants more robust, and it's going
[22:46.240 --> 22:50.980]  to make them develop stronger roots. I think the plants do better when we give them a little
[22:50.980 --> 22:54.720]  bit of wind. There's wind outside. They would get blown around a little bit.
[22:54.720 --> 22:58.680]  I think that what happens when I push you? If I shove you a little bit, not super hard,
[22:58.680 --> 23:02.560]  but if I just give you a little nudge, what do you do? Natural instinct is to spread your
[23:02.560 --> 23:06.680]  feet further apart to have better balance. I feel like if we blow on a plant and make
[23:06.680 --> 23:10.440]  it wobble around a little bit, maybe it's going to spread its roots a little bit wider
[23:10.440 --> 23:14.840]  to get better balance, which will also result in a more robust stock, which will result
[23:14.840 --> 23:19.560]  in an overall more productive plant when we move that plant into the flowering phase.
[23:19.560 --> 23:22.960]  Let's give the plants a little bit of wind. They would get wind outside. Let's introduce
[23:22.960 --> 23:29.400]  a little bit of that to our indoor environment. Again, don't blast the plants. If some of
[23:29.400 --> 23:35.280]  the leaves closest to that fan start getting dry or leathery or crinkly, or they start
[23:35.280 --> 23:40.120]  looking like a potato chip, they're getting blasted too hard by the fan. Reduce either
[23:40.120 --> 23:43.860]  the fan speed or the frequency that they're getting hit by the fan. They're getting too
[23:43.860 --> 23:49.440]  much air movement and you're disrupting the vapor pressure deficit in that area.
[23:49.440 --> 23:52.700]  Pay attention to the leaves. They will let you know if they're getting too much wind,
[23:52.700 --> 23:56.800]  but give them a little bit of airflow and your plants will really be happy for it. You
[23:56.800 --> 24:00.600]  like a nice little breeze, don't you? Nice warm day, nice sunshine on your face. What's
[24:00.600 --> 24:04.080]  the next best thing that could come along? It's just a nice little breeze. I think the
[24:04.080 --> 24:08.000]  plants feel the same way. Give them a nice little breeze and I think they will appreciate
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.080]  it. You'll make them stronger. You'll make them more robust and you'll give them just
[24:11.080 --> 24:13.680]  some fresh air more frequently.
[24:13.680 --> 24:18.880]  Now let's talk a little bit about nutrients for our small veg plants. We don't need a
[24:18.880 --> 24:23.640]  supercharged nutrient regimen for these little plants. We don't want to burn them. We don't
[24:23.640 --> 24:27.800]  want to shock them. We don't want to stunt them while they're babies. We want to focus
[24:27.800 --> 24:32.880]  on a balanced diet. I like to focus, like I keep saying, on root development for these
[24:32.880 --> 24:38.400]  small plants. So I like a light vegetative nutrient. If you're working with bottled nutrients,
[24:38.400 --> 24:44.680]  here are a few things to think about. If you are working in cocoa or soil or soilless mix
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.920]  or hydro, you need to pay attention to whatever product line you decide to buy and see if
[24:49.920 --> 24:56.640]  they offer a soil, a cocoa, or a hydro variety. The nutrients will be chelated differently
[24:56.640 --> 25:00.760]  and they will be in different ratios because your plants will uptake things differently
[25:00.800 --> 25:07.360]  in different mediums. Many of the companies that make nutrients offer a soil or a hydro
[25:07.360 --> 25:12.440]  option when it comes to buying their products. If you are growing in cocoa, I recommend you
[25:12.440 --> 25:18.280]  get the hydroponic version of the product you are buying. Cocoa is more like hydro than
[25:18.280 --> 25:24.040]  it is like soil or a soilless mix. So if you're shopping for nutrients and you're in cocoa,
[25:24.040 --> 25:28.920]  I would recommend that you buy the bottle that is recommended for hydro.
[25:28.960 --> 25:32.600]  Now when you're looking at bottled nutrients, you're going to find three numbers displayed
[25:32.600 --> 25:39.000]  on the bottle. That is the NPK value of that nutrient. The first number is nitrogen. That
[25:39.000 --> 25:45.600]  tells us the ratio of nitrogen in that product. The next number will be the amount of phosphorus.
[25:45.600 --> 25:50.200]  Then the next number will be the amount of potassium. When it comes to veg nutrients,
[25:50.200 --> 25:55.360]  we are looking for a product with a high N ratio and lower P and K numbers. We don't
[25:55.360 --> 25:59.800]  need a lot of phosphorus and potassium. We want to focus on that nitrogen for building
[25:59.800 --> 26:06.320]  strong robust plants with a lot of energy. So we need a good solid grow base nutrient.
[26:06.320 --> 26:11.560]  Let's talk a little bit about base nutrients. Whatever company you choose to work with,
[26:11.560 --> 26:17.000]  they probably offer a two or three part base nutrient system. A lot of them will have a
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.000]  grow and a bloom. That makes it pretty obvious. You use the grow for your vegetative stage
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.440]  and you use the bloom for your flowering stage. A lot of companies offer a two part
[26:27.440 --> 26:32.960]  product which will be an A and a B grow. They also offer an A and a B bloom, but we don't
[26:32.960 --> 26:38.680]  need those. So let's talk about those later. You will take your grow A and grow B and you
[26:38.680 --> 26:44.140]  will mix those into your water to create your vegetative nutrient based solution. The reason
[26:44.140 --> 26:48.940]  they sell an A and a B is because there are things in bottle A and things in bottle B
[26:48.940 --> 26:53.900]  that will bind together chemically if they are mixed together without being diluted in
[26:53.900 --> 26:57.820]  our water. So you would fill your container. I generally use a five gallon bucket in a
[26:57.820 --> 27:02.660]  home grow. You'd fill your five gallon bucket with water. You would apply the correct amount,
[27:02.660 --> 27:06.420]  the appropriate amount of veg A. Then you would apply the appropriate amount of veg
[27:06.420 --> 27:11.020]  B. Then you would mix it up. Then you would continue to add the rest of the required nutrients.
[27:11.020 --> 27:16.100]  That is a two part vegetative nutrient solution. Other companies will offer their products
[27:16.100 --> 27:20.420]  in a different format. They will offer what is called a base and then they will give you
[27:20.420 --> 27:25.540]  a grow and a bloom to add on top of that. With that type of nutrient regimen, you will
[27:25.540 --> 27:30.500]  use that base product through the entire cycle, through veg and through flour. Then you'll
[27:30.500 --> 27:34.580]  use that grow additive during the growth phase. And when you switch to flour, you'll switch
[27:34.580 --> 27:38.980]  to that flowering additive and they've just put the appropriate additives in those bottles
[27:38.980 --> 27:43.620]  to keep everything running smoothly with that base nutrient in there. Now, whatever brand
[27:43.620 --> 27:48.620]  you choose, be sure you get the appropriate veg nutrient setup. If it's a two part, make
[27:48.620 --> 27:53.260]  sure you get the A and B. If it's the kind where you have to have a base and a grow nutrient,
[27:53.260 --> 27:56.780]  make sure you get the base and the grow. If you get something simple where there's just
[27:56.780 --> 28:01.620]  a bottle that says veg, there you go. You're ready to go. You've got that one strong veg
[28:01.620 --> 28:05.460]  nutrient. All right. I feel like we have a good handle on base nutrients. We need a good
[28:05.460 --> 28:11.820]  base nutrient with a strong nitrogen value. Now I would recommend you feed those plants
[28:11.820 --> 28:15.540]  maybe a quarter of the recommended strength for the first couple of times you feed your
[28:15.540 --> 28:21.020]  plants new nutrients. Give them a light feeding and pay close attention. Write it down so
[28:21.020 --> 28:25.860]  that you know exactly what you did. Also write down the pH, write down the EC if that is
[28:25.860 --> 28:31.100]  an option for you. The more notes you take, the more you can do research to dial in where
[28:31.100 --> 28:36.420]  you went wrong. A lot of us consume a lot of cannabis. Some of us consume cannabis while
[28:36.420 --> 28:40.260]  we're working in the gardens. Sometimes you say, I wonder what I put in there. And you
[28:40.260 --> 28:44.260]  have no idea where you went wrong. That won't happen if you take notes and write things
[28:44.260 --> 28:49.300]  down. I've done an entire episode on journaling and I suggest you listen to that one as well.
[28:49.300 --> 28:53.220]  So we've got a reliable base nutrient. We've decided how much to use it. Started a quarter
[28:53.220 --> 28:57.500]  strength, maybe work your way up to a third, maybe a half. You're definitely not going
[28:57.500 --> 29:01.820]  to need full strength nutrients for small plants. A lot of your nutrient companies will
[29:01.820 --> 29:07.620]  offer a feeding schedule. A lot of those feeding schedules will have a small plant recommendation.
[29:07.620 --> 29:13.060]  I still recommend you reduce that a little bit until you see how the plants will react.
[29:13.060 --> 29:19.380]  So we've got a base nutrient. With small plants, I always recommend some sort of myco products,
[29:19.380 --> 29:24.500]  some sort of root inoculant products, something to make those roots go kapow. I try to avoid
[29:24.500 --> 29:29.300]  recommending specific products. Here is a long list of reliable products that will work
[29:29.300 --> 29:36.400]  great for your roots. I like Mammoth Pea. I like Plus Life from Veg Bloom. I like Recharge
[29:36.440 --> 29:41.880]  from Scotty Real. I like Great White Shark and Orca and MycoChum. I think that is a great
[29:41.880 --> 29:46.720]  combination. Some of those products are a little expensive. Some are more affordable.
[29:46.720 --> 29:52.600]  I can also recommend a product called Mycos. It is a very affordable bag of microbe products.
[29:52.600 --> 29:58.160]  As long as you are using some sort of microbe product, I think you will see very increased
[29:58.160 --> 30:02.800]  root production compared to if you did not use it. Of course, I like the higher end,
[30:02.800 --> 30:07.520]  fancier, more expensive products, but if you can't afford that, get what you can afford.
[30:07.520 --> 30:13.440]  I highly recommend a microbe or a myco or a root inoculant product for your small plants.
[30:13.440 --> 30:17.400]  It will really speed up your production and I think the plants will really show a huge
[30:17.400 --> 30:21.240]  difference and you will notice it and it will make you a happier grower.
[30:21.240 --> 30:25.900]  So we've got a reliable vegetative nutrient with enough nitrogen in it. We have decided
[30:25.900 --> 30:32.220]  on a microbe product. That would be enough for our small veg plants for two to four weeks.
[30:32.220 --> 30:37.220]  You may want to add some fulvic acid to your mix. I like adding some fulvic. I think it
[30:37.220 --> 30:41.220]  makes the plants uptake the nutrients more quickly and I think it's really worth the
[30:41.220 --> 30:45.920]  investment. Just a small bottle of fulvic acid will really improve your nutrient uptake
[30:45.920 --> 30:46.920]  in your plants.
[30:46.920 --> 30:51.040]  Now, if you've got a good solid base nutrient and you're feeding your roots, your plants
[30:51.040 --> 30:55.520]  are really happy. You've added a little fulvic acid that's increasing the uptake. As the
[30:55.520 --> 31:01.260]  plants get a little bit bigger, you may need to introduce some CalMag. Be careful not to
[31:01.260 --> 31:06.940]  overdose small plants on CalMag. Sometimes the young plants really don't react well
[31:06.940 --> 31:09.420]  to too much CalMag, so be careful.
[31:09.420 --> 31:13.940]  Now basically we've got a veg nutrient. We've got some mycos. We've got a little bit of
[31:13.940 --> 31:20.660]  fulvic acid and maybe around week three, we're going to add a dose of CalMag. This feed should
[31:20.660 --> 31:25.820]  keep our plants super happy. One important thing we need to think about is the pH of
[31:25.820 --> 31:27.760]  our feeding solution.
[31:27.760 --> 31:33.160]  For plants this size, I generally recommend we adjust the pH somewhere between 5.9 and
[31:33.160 --> 31:39.080]  6.2. Again, we adjust the pH after all of the nutrients have been mixed in. You've got
[31:39.080 --> 31:45.000]  your bucket of water. You add in the appropriate recommended amount of each bottle of nutrients.
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.200]  Then you give it a good stir, make sure it's nice and mixed. Then we check the pH. Then
[31:49.200 --> 31:51.320]  we adjust accordingly.
[31:51.320 --> 31:56.720]  We've got a solid veg mix. We've got it pH adjusted. Now it is time to water our plants.
[31:56.720 --> 32:02.120]  I recommend when you water, you saturate your medium thoroughly. Don't drown the plants,
[32:02.120 --> 32:06.360]  but make sure that all of the soil or cocoa or whatever medium you are watering, make
[32:06.360 --> 32:11.400]  sure it is saturated. We don't want any dry pockets. Your roots will not grow into dry
[32:11.400 --> 32:14.800]  spots, so moisten all of your medium.
[32:14.800 --> 32:20.480]  Now is probably a good time to remind you guys of episode 337, where I do a lesson on
[32:20.480 --> 32:24.680]  what is called one through five water tech. If you're a new grower and you haven't heard
[32:24.720 --> 32:29.200]  the one through five water tech discussion, I highly recommend you listen to that episode
[32:29.200 --> 32:34.480]  right after this. It is episode 337 and it will teach you a lot about watering your plants
[32:34.480 --> 32:35.680]  correctly.
[32:35.680 --> 32:40.040]  So we have appropriately watered our small plants with nutrients. When do we need to
[32:40.040 --> 32:45.560]  give our plants nutrients again? That is a really good question. In cocoa, I like to
[32:45.560 --> 32:51.120]  feed nutrients to my plants at every single watering. Every single day, I will feed my
[32:51.120 --> 32:56.740]  plants a solid base mix. Then I will add a booster every day and I will rotate those
[32:56.740 --> 33:01.900]  boosters depending on what the plants may need. In this small veg case, my booster would
[33:01.900 --> 33:06.280]  be the cow mag. I would water the nutrients. I would put the base nutrient, I would put
[33:06.280 --> 33:11.600]  the fulvic acid and I would put the mycos in my nutrient solution every single day.
[33:11.600 --> 33:15.520]  Then once a week, I would put that cow mag in there. That would be my booster for these
[33:15.520 --> 33:17.120]  small plants.
[33:17.120 --> 33:21.520]  Now if you're working in soil or soilless mix, you don't need to feed nutrients as often
[33:21.520 --> 33:26.280]  because they stick around in the dirt a little better. I would recommend you feed with nutrients
[33:26.280 --> 33:31.560]  one feed, then water the next feed. When you're feeding with just clean water, please adjust
[33:31.560 --> 33:36.520]  the pH just like you do when you're mixing nutrients. Fill your container with water,
[33:36.520 --> 33:41.440]  stick your pH meter in there, see what it says, adjust it up or down accordingly. You
[33:41.440 --> 33:44.400]  need to adjust the pH at every feeding.
[33:44.400 --> 33:49.760]  So I would recommend you do one feeding of nutrients, one watering of pH adjusted water,
[33:49.760 --> 33:54.560]  then I would go back to that basic nutrient regimen for the next watering. These small
[33:54.560 --> 33:59.360]  veg plants will need frequent watering. Pay attention to them. Don't let them get too
[33:59.360 --> 34:04.540]  dry. Don't let them be over watered. Once again, check out the 1-5 watering tech.
[34:04.540 --> 34:08.920]  Another thing we need to pay attention to is over-nutrienting. Are we over-fertilizing
[34:08.920 --> 34:13.680]  these plants? Are we burning them? Pay attention to the leaf tips. If the very tips of the
[34:13.680 --> 34:18.560]  leaves start to look brown or the wrong color or if they start to curl, we are feeding too
[34:18.560 --> 34:24.640]  much. If your leaves look pale and yellow, we are not feeding enough. If you have a mixture
[34:24.640 --> 34:27.900]  of those two symptoms, your pH is probably off.
[34:27.900 --> 34:32.120]  One of the very first things I recommended in these grow lessons was that you buy a book
[34:32.120 --> 34:36.200]  and you read it. Hopefully you've already done some reading. Hopefully you have looked
[34:36.200 --> 34:40.680]  at some leaf charts and you know what deficiencies look like so you know what to pay attention
[34:40.680 --> 34:44.320]  to. You know what a healthy leaf looks like and you know what an unhealthy leaf looks
[34:44.320 --> 34:48.000]  like and it's going to pop out in your head. When you see those leaves doing something
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.080]  weird, you're going to say, that's not what the book said this should look like. Hopefully
[34:52.080 --> 34:55.320]  you've gotten the book. Hopefully you have read the book.
[34:55.320 --> 34:59.560]  Pay attention to your plants. If they are showing you that they need more nutrients,
[34:59.560 --> 35:04.080]  increase your nutrients. Give it a little more base nutrients. You probably don't need
[35:04.080 --> 35:09.400]  to increase the amount of fulvic. When it comes to mycos, I have learned that it is
[35:09.400 --> 35:15.440]  better to feed small amounts more frequently than to try to feed a whole bunch at one time.
[35:15.440 --> 35:18.600]  You're not going to do any good by pouring the whole bottle in there at one time. It
[35:18.600 --> 35:23.640]  would be more effective to pour the bottle in there slowly over a course of time. Maybe
[35:23.640 --> 35:27.240]  if you see a deficiency, just increase that base nutrient.
[35:27.240 --> 35:30.760]  What you're going to run into a deficiency with in small plants is either going to be
[35:30.760 --> 35:36.560]  nitrogen or calmag. That is going to be your most common deficiency. Pay attention to those
[35:36.600 --> 35:40.280]  two things and learn what that looks like.
[35:40.280 --> 35:44.080]  The next common thing you're going to find is nutrient burn. People are going to try
[35:44.080 --> 35:49.560]  to feed too much to these plants. I heard somebody say the term moron. I just want to
[35:49.560 --> 35:54.560]  put more on it to make it grow faster. I thought it was hilarious when I heard that. I know
[35:54.560 --> 35:57.840]  a lot of people like that. Don't be that guy.
[35:57.840 --> 36:02.600]  Now, if you're running a hydroponic system, if you're in Rockwell Cubes and you're doing
[36:02.600 --> 36:07.360]  a top feed, or if you're in some type of ebb and flow system, your small veg phase
[36:07.360 --> 36:13.200]  will not be nearly as long as us growing in cocoa or a soilless mix. Your small veg phase
[36:13.200 --> 36:18.760]  zips right by. I think the hydro grows go much more quickly in veg. Your small veg phase
[36:18.760 --> 36:21.040]  may be only about a week long.
[36:21.040 --> 36:27.800]  You're going to need to introduce more nutrients at a higher rate sooner in a hydroponic setup.
[36:28.280 --> 36:32.840]  Pay attention to the plants. That is very plant specific and very strain specific. But
[36:32.840 --> 36:38.520]  since the plants grow a little more quickly, you are going to need more nutrients sooner.
[36:38.520 --> 36:43.360]  One thing I'm going to remind you of in your hydroponics is to stay on top of your pH and
[36:43.360 --> 36:49.840]  your EC or your PPMs. Check it every single day and adjust as needed.
[36:49.840 --> 36:55.000]  Water is going to evaporate from your hydroponic setup, but the nutrients will not evaporate.
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.520]  So your pH and your PPMs are going to fluctuate during that evaporation. Also, the plants
[37:00.520 --> 37:04.400]  are going to consume some of the water. So the water is going to disappear throughout
[37:04.400 --> 37:09.160]  the day, which is going to cause changes in your reservoir. As a hydroponic grower, you
[37:09.160 --> 37:15.000]  need to be on top of that every single day. Also, I'm going to recommend you take extra
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.680]  notes as a hydro grower.
[37:17.680 --> 37:20.780]  Reactions happen a little more quickly and the plants are a little more sensitive when
[37:20.780 --> 37:26.620]  you're running hydro because you don't have that big soil life system to work as a buffer.
[37:26.620 --> 37:30.700]  All right, boys and girls, I feel like that is a good talk on small veg. We're going to
[37:30.700 --> 37:35.100]  leave these plants in these pots for two to four weeks, depending on how quickly they
[37:35.100 --> 37:39.540]  grow. That's very strain dependent. That's very environment dependent. One thing I want
[37:39.540 --> 37:44.180]  to remind you to do is spread your small veg plants out. We do have them crushed together
[37:44.180 --> 37:48.460]  now because they're small plants, but as they get larger, make sure you spread them out,
[37:48.460 --> 37:52.100]  give them more space. They want to grow. They want to branch out. If you've got them
[37:52.100 --> 37:55.940]  all crushed together, they're going to grow straight up and get really, really tall. If
[37:55.940 --> 37:59.900]  you give them space to branch out, they will do so. And then when you top them, you've
[37:59.900 --> 38:03.500]  got nice bushes. But that's coming up in the future.
[38:03.500 --> 38:07.700]  You guys, I know I didn't talk about soil. I didn't talk about containers in this episode.
[38:07.700 --> 38:11.700]  I feel like I covered that in the previous episode. So we were up to speed there. We're
[38:11.700 --> 38:15.500]  going to leave these plants in these containers for two to four weeks. Then we will up pot
[38:15.500 --> 38:20.420]  them into three gallon or five gallon or perhaps seven gallon containers. Maybe some
[38:20.420 --> 38:23.860]  of you out there are going to go huge and go into a 20 or an even larger container,
[38:23.860 --> 38:27.420]  but we're going to work on that on the next episode. So we've got a little time to let
[38:27.420 --> 38:32.540]  these plants grow. Your job now is to keep them healthy, keep them happy, keep them pest
[38:32.540 --> 38:37.700]  and pathogen free. Keep working on those roots. If you see any yellow or funky leaves, make
[38:37.700 --> 38:41.620]  sure you pull that stuff off. Just take good care of your new sweet little babies. Make
[38:41.620 --> 38:44.860]  sure they don't have any problems so that when we transplant them into their bigger
[38:44.860 --> 38:49.540]  pots, they're ready to go. They've got a fat root system and they don't go into any shock
[38:49.540 --> 38:54.260]  from a transplant. I just realized that I did not cover any pest management for our
[38:54.260 --> 38:58.820]  small plants. Let's talk about that really quickly. Hopefully you have decided on an
[38:58.820 --> 39:03.540]  integrated pest management system for your garden before this point. Hopefully that was
[39:03.540 --> 39:09.060]  part of your planning phase. Hopefully we don't have any pests or problems on our small
[39:09.060 --> 39:14.380]  plants. Some folks will choose to apply a pesticide as a preventative. Some folks will
[39:14.380 --> 39:20.220]  wait until they see a problem to use a pesticide on a plant this small. I would like to wait
[39:20.220 --> 39:24.820]  until I transplant these into their three gallon pots before I put any pesticides on
[39:24.820 --> 39:29.920]  them. However, in some environments, I don't trust the place and I need to put a pesticide
[39:29.920 --> 39:35.300]  on it. I would use something like evergreen and I would probably use it around 15 mils
[39:35.300 --> 39:39.580]  per gallon. I would make sure to apply it while the lights were off and I would be sure
[39:39.580 --> 39:44.740]  that the plants were completely dry before I turn the lights back on. I would probably
[39:44.740 --> 39:50.340]  do this approximately every five to seven days while the plants are little if I were
[39:50.340 --> 39:54.340]  in a place that had a reputation for getting a pest infestation.
[39:54.340 --> 39:58.940]  All right, I feel like that should keep us pest free for the first four weeks and then
[39:58.940 --> 40:04.500]  we can really start implementing our integrated pest management once we transplant into those
[40:04.660 --> 40:09.780]  three gallon pots. All right, Podcast World, I feel like that is a solid show about small
[40:09.780 --> 40:14.820]  veg. If you feel like this episode was educational, informative, or entertaining, and you would
[40:14.820 --> 40:19.340]  like to make a financial contribution to the show, I encourage you to do so. You can do
[40:19.340 --> 40:26.340]  that by going to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart. All of the information you need to become a
[40:26.340 --> 40:30.420]  patron will be right there on the screen and I do appreciate all of the support.
[40:30.860 --> 40:34.980]  Now while I'm talking about Patreon, let me bring up something I keep forgetting to mention
[40:34.980 --> 40:42.260]  on the podcast. Recently, Patreon changed the way that contributors' cards are billed. During
[40:42.260 --> 40:48.220]  that process, many contributors were removed from content creators' pages. If you feel
[40:48.220 --> 40:53.820]  like you are contributing to a Patreon campaign, I encourage you to log into your Patreon account
[40:53.820 --> 40:59.060]  and check the status of all your content creators. Please make sure you are still signed up and
[40:59.060 --> 41:03.260]  contributing to all of the people in which you have been supporting. Support from our
[41:03.260 --> 41:08.020]  community means a lot to content creators and it would really break our hearts to lose
[41:08.020 --> 41:13.460]  contributions because of a technical glitch. So again, please check on your Patreon campaigns,
[41:13.460 --> 41:17.100]  make sure you are contributing to all of the creators which you believe you are creating,
[41:17.100 --> 41:21.500]  and keep the vibe alive and keep showing them love and support. All right, you guys, that's
[41:21.500 --> 41:24.940]  all I've got for you for this week. I would appreciate it if you find me on the social
[41:24.940 --> 41:29.020]  media, on Facebook. Simply search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast on Twitter. It's
