[00:17.790 --> 00:22.270]  Yeah, welcome back everybody. It's time for episode number 94 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:22.270 --> 00:27.710]  podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right. If you're
[00:27.710 --> 00:31.910]  a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:31.910 --> 00:35.310]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state
[00:35.310 --> 00:40.510]  of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host. They call me Rasta
[00:40.510 --> 00:43.830]  Jeff. I want to thank you guys for joining me. As always, I need to send a huge thank
[00:43.830 --> 00:46.910]  you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band for letting me use their music
[00:46.910 --> 00:52.510]  on the show. Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew. What's up everybody?
[00:52.510 --> 00:55.270]  I'm coming to you on a beautiful Thursday afternoon. I just got done working at the
[00:55.270 --> 01:00.310]  spot dispensary for the day. It's hot as shit today. It's about 90 degrees. We were in the
[01:00.310 --> 01:04.070]  spot testing out the air conditioners. We've done a little bit of construction and some
[01:04.070 --> 01:07.270]  rebuilding. So we were testing everything out today, putting in some work, putting in
[01:07.270 --> 01:12.110]  some hours. I hope everyone's having a great day. If you are ever in Southern Colorado,
[01:12.110 --> 01:16.830]  if you're in the Pueblo, Colorado or the Pueblo West area, please stop by the spot dispensary.
[01:16.830 --> 01:19.950]  Drop in if you need some cannabis, if you need some hash, if you need some edibles,
[01:19.950 --> 01:22.910]  if you need some topicals, we would love to see you at the spot. If you listen to the
[01:22.910 --> 01:27.470]  podcast, drop in, tell them that you listen to the podcast. Ask if I'm there. If I am
[01:27.470 --> 01:32.070]  there and I'm not busy, they may call me from the back and I may come out and shake your
[01:32.070 --> 01:36.310]  hand and say hello. It'd be great to meet you. That just kind of depends on who's working
[01:36.310 --> 01:39.670]  and who's there. If they're able to do that, they'll come get me and I'll come say hi to
[01:39.670 --> 01:44.190]  you. I'd love to meet you. Anyway, I've got a bunch of great stuff to talk about today.
[01:44.190 --> 01:47.670]  You guys have got some news articles. I've got some stuff like that. But first I want
[01:47.670 --> 01:52.630]  to talk about my weekend, man. I got to see my favorite band. If you guys know me, you
[01:52.630 --> 01:56.310]  know that my favorite band is fish. I got to see two fish shows over the weekend. I
[01:56.310 --> 02:02.990]  saw Saturday and Sunday night at the Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado.
[02:02.990 --> 02:07.430]  Saturday was a pretty good show, but Sunday was a really spectacular show. They did some
[02:07.430 --> 02:12.230]  great songs. They did stuff they haven't played in several years. The band sounded great.
[02:12.230 --> 02:16.670]  The crowd was in a good mood. Everything was amazing. The only thing that kind of sucked,
[02:16.670 --> 02:20.430]  and it didn't suck really, but my favorite song from Fish, I think my favorite song is
[02:20.430 --> 02:25.230]  called Punch You in the Eye. And the middle section of Punch You in the Eye is a jam that
[02:25.230 --> 02:29.190]  has been labeled The Landlady. The Landlady was written first. Punch You in the Eye was
[02:29.190 --> 02:33.110]  written. The Landlady was dropped into the middle of Punch You in the Eye is the groove
[02:33.110 --> 02:38.790]  portion. And it's always been played as one piece since then. But on Sunday night, they
[02:38.790 --> 02:43.070]  opened with The Landlady, which is the middle section of my favorite song. So it was a little
[02:43.070 --> 02:46.870]  disappointing knowing that I wasn't going to hear my favorite song through the whole
[02:46.870 --> 02:50.950]  weekend. But it was okay, because they made up for it by playing some, like I said, some
[02:50.950 --> 02:54.390]  old songs that I haven't heard in a long time and stuff that they have not played in several
[02:54.390 --> 03:00.310]  years. If anybody here is a Fish fan, they played Harpua. That means a lot to people.
[03:00.310 --> 03:03.830]  If you're a Fish fan, they don't play Harpua very often. And when they do play Harpua,
[03:03.830 --> 03:07.310]  it's a really great thing. So that's enough rambling about the Fish concert. I had a great
[03:07.310 --> 03:10.950]  time. Big shout out to Fish. They put on a hell of a show. It was the end of the summer
[03:10.950 --> 03:15.310]  tour. They played a Day in the Life by the Beatles. They played a lot of they played
[03:15.310 --> 03:19.590]  Talking Heads cover. They played After Midnight. They played a lot of great shit. So big shout
[03:19.590 --> 03:22.750]  out to Fish. I had a wonderful time. Shout out to everybody I met on the Fish lot. I
[03:22.750 --> 03:26.830]  got to advertise the podcast to a couple of people. Big shout out to those folks if you're
[03:26.830 --> 03:30.990]  listening now. Also shout out to Danielle for being a great Fishing companion. I had
[03:30.990 --> 03:35.710]  a great time with you. Thanks for coming with me. So that's enough ranting about Fish. You
[03:36.070 --> 03:39.630]  guys, we got a new comment on iTunes. There might be two new comments. I don't remember
[03:39.630 --> 03:42.510]  if I read this one or not. So I'm going to head to iTunes right quick and we will read
[03:42.510 --> 03:46.030]  this comment. And then I think we're going to get right into some news. So let's read
[03:46.030 --> 03:51.550]  these comments. This comment comes from Eden 2013 and this was left August 27. So there's
[03:51.550 --> 03:54.670]  a good chance I've read this but I take a lot of dabs on the show. So there's a chance
[03:54.670 --> 03:59.590]  I did not read this. I don't remember. It says educated and entertained and they gave
[03:59.590 --> 04:04.350]  us five stars. It says thank you for this podcast. I appreciate how organized and articulate
[04:04.350 --> 04:08.150]  you are. I've learned so much. I also love your hippie love attitude. Great show. I'm
[04:08.150 --> 04:12.990]  looking forward to the college level grow lessons you promised for episode 100. Peace.
[04:12.990 --> 04:17.710]  I think I read that because I remember reading the college grow lessons I promised. Those
[04:17.710 --> 04:22.750]  won't be on episode 100 but they will after episode 100. I do kind of plan on kicking
[04:22.750 --> 04:27.070]  up the education level on this podcast. I've gone kind of the intro level. You know what
[04:27.070 --> 04:30.830]  I mean? You've had your introductory courses from me. If you've been listening to all 90
[04:30.830 --> 04:34.110]  something episodes, it's time for you to step up your game and we're going to start learning
[04:34.110 --> 04:39.070]  a little bit more in depth shit after episode 100. All right, so big shout out to our friend
[04:39.070 --> 04:44.910]  Eden 2013. You left a sweet comment and you gave me five stars. I appreciate that. Thanks
[04:44.910 --> 04:48.590]  a lot. You did what you were told. There's nothing fucking cooler than that. We've got
[04:48.590 --> 04:52.630]  another comment. It comes from our friend teacher from Philly and it says five stars
[04:52.630 --> 04:57.210]  from Philly. They gave me five stars. This comment was left September 2nd. It says I've
[04:57.210 --> 05:01.070]  been listening for a while now and I have some experience with your seeds. I just dropping

[05:09.750 --> 05:13.910]  from Philly. It sounds like you're a teacher. I appreciate any type of teacher. I know how
[05:13.910 --> 05:17.830]  it is to be a teacher. It's hard. It takes a lot of work and dedication. So I appreciate
[05:17.830 --> 05:22.270]  that. I also want to say thank you for noticing and thanks for the comment. That's really
[05:22.270 --> 05:26.070]  awesome. Because I would love it if you left a comment on iTunes. Just go to iTunes, go

[05:33.910 --> 05:38.110]  And I will read your comment on a future episode just like I did these. So big thanks to Eden
[05:38.110 --> 05:42.550]  2013 and teacher from Philly. I appreciate those comments, you guys. All right. I've
[05:42.550 --> 05:46.230]  got a few news articles I want to read, but a lot of you guys are out there smoking some
[05:46.230 --> 05:50.270]  cannabis right now. A lot of you are taking some dabs. A lot of you are hitting the vaporizer.
[05:50.270 --> 05:53.950]  A lot of you are maybe eating some edibles or whatever you're doing. What I want to do,
[05:53.950 --> 05:57.750]  I want to do a dab with everybody right now. And if you're not able to take a dab, if you're
[05:57.750 --> 06:02.510]  listening to this podcast in your cubicle or in the shop or in your car and you're unable
[06:02.510 --> 06:06.830]  to take a fat dab right now, then this dab that I'm about to take is for you. If you're
[06:06.830 --> 06:09.950]  somewhere where you're able to take a dab, I want you to get a dab ready and I want you
[06:09.950 --> 06:14.950]  to dab with me. So start getting it ready. I've got the email, so I'm already hot. All
[06:14.950 --> 06:17.750]  I got to do is get it ready. So right now I'm getting a dab ready. I got a nice chunky
[06:17.750 --> 06:22.650]  dab. What am I smoking here? I am smoking some candy cush, uh, some shatter. It's real
[06:22.650 --> 06:26.790]  nice and Ambery real clear. Uh, it's real, real shattery. So we're going to put some
[06:26.790 --> 06:30.350]  of this on the dabber here. I've almost got it ready. All right. Now I want you guys to
[06:30.350 --> 06:34.950]  start heating your nail. Usually it takes somewhere between 10 and 20 seconds. So if
[06:34.950 --> 06:39.390]  you need more time, I'm gonna let you have it. I'm kind of trying to hesitate, but it's
[06:39.390 --> 06:42.710]  hard to hesitate on a podcast. All right. It's about dab time. You guys, I'm getting
[06:42.710 --> 06:47.310]  the rig up to my face. All right. I want everybody listening to take a dab with me right now.
[06:47.310 --> 06:50.310]  This would be a big group dab and then we're going to read some news. And if you cannot
[06:50.310 --> 06:54.390]  take a dab, all of us that are dabbing are thinking about all of the people that are
[06:54.390 --> 06:59.910]  at work or wherever they are on the bus, uh, in a taxi. If you're in an Uber, you can
[06:59.910 --> 07:03.870]  probably smoke some weed. Most Uber drivers don't give a shit if you smoke out their Uber
[07:03.870 --> 07:06.870]  ride. So if you're in an Uber, you have no excuse. Get down on a bowl, get down on a
[07:06.870 --> 07:11.430]  dab. But here we go, guys. This is a group dab. Let's do this on the count of six, four,
[07:11.430 --> 07:29.690]  five, six. Here we go. Fat dabs. Yeah, that's what I like. That's what I like. Like about
[07:29.690 --> 07:34.530]  a half gram dab of some candy kush. And I don't cough. It's very rare when I cough from
[07:34.530 --> 07:38.530]  a dab and I've got to take like a serious dab or the water's got to be murky or something's
[07:38.530 --> 07:42.890]  got to go wrong if I'm going to cough from a dab. But that was a fat dab. I hope everybody
[07:42.890 --> 07:45.730]  got to take a dab with me. You guys, if you weren't able to take a dab, I hope you're
[07:45.730 --> 07:48.650]  feeling the dab that I just took. I hope you're feeling the love. I hope you're feeling the
[07:48.650 --> 07:53.130]  vibe. I really appreciate you guys for joining me for a dab. All right. I've been talking
[07:53.130 --> 07:56.710]  about some news articles and I've been rambling for a few minutes. So let's open up these
[07:56.710 --> 08:01.870]  news articles. And just to just for a disclaimer, I know that earlier in the future in a past
[08:01.870 --> 08:05.630]  episode I said that I was going to get more into grow lessons. I will do that. I have
[08:05.630 --> 08:10.070]  been doing that. I've got a lot of stuff coming up. I've got a CBD episode coming up. I've
[08:10.070 --> 08:13.630]  got a few episodes in the works that are partial episodes. I'm taking notes and getting shit
[08:13.630 --> 08:17.990]  ready. But there has been so much news that I feel it's my responsibility to bring this
[08:17.990 --> 08:24.230]  news to you. So here comes the first news article. I found this article on the cannabis
[08:24.230 --> 08:29.430]  and it was written by John Murray of the Denver Post. The headline says Denver social
[08:29.430 --> 08:34.430]  pot use plans are getting overhauled. The sub headline says the idea isn't dead. Backers
[08:34.430 --> 08:38.830]  of the proposal say they will join talks with city and business leaders to try to work out
[08:38.830 --> 08:44.190]  a compromise. So the article goes like this. Activists behind a proposed Denver ballot
[08:44.190 --> 08:48.270]  initiative to allow some marijuana use in bars and other businesses say they will pull
[08:48.270 --> 08:53.350]  the measure. The Denver Post has confirmed their new goal, crafting a compromise measure
[08:53.350 --> 08:57.550]  with city and business leaders. The verbal agreement with a group that includes city
[08:57.550 --> 09:01.750]  attorney Scott Martinez averts a public vote in November, one that might have allowed more
[09:01.750 --> 09:07.110]  extensive pot consumption in publicly accessible places than city officials and some business
[09:07.110 --> 09:11.870]  leaders were comfortable with. Mason Tivert of the marijuana policy project said fellow
[09:11.870 --> 09:16.190]  backers of the limited social cannabis use initiative plan to announce the withdrawal
[09:16.190 --> 09:22.550]  Thursday before Friday's expected certification of the measure for the November 3rd ballot.
[09:22.550 --> 09:25.830]  Activists now will shift to working with city officials and the state restaurant and
[09:25.830 --> 09:29.670]  lodging associations to work out an ordinance that they hope will be considered by the Denver
[09:29.670 --> 09:34.270]  Council or by the city council. Excuse me. Within the next year, the downtown Denver
[09:34.270 --> 09:39.750]  partnership, which represents business interests in that area, also plans to take part. We're
[09:39.750 --> 09:44.110]  not approaching the withdrawal of this initiative lightly, said Tivert, who also was a co author
[09:44.110 --> 09:49.350]  of Colorado's marijuana legalizing Amendment 64 in 2012. We believe that cannabis users
[09:49.350 --> 09:55.030]  derive deserve the freedom and let me try that again. We believe that cannabis users
[09:55.030 --> 09:59.590]  deserve the freedom to congregate and socialize to the same extent as alcohol users. And you
[09:59.590 --> 10:03.810]  guys, I'm going to interject here. When we set up this cannabis system that we have,
[10:03.810 --> 10:08.370]  the whole model that they modeled it after was to make it like alcohol. They wanted to
[10:08.370 --> 10:13.790]  regulate it like alcohol. And we're able to go to so many places and drink alcohol all
[10:13.790 --> 10:17.510]  night long. Why aren't there a few places for us to go and take some dabs and smoke
[10:17.510 --> 10:21.490]  some flowers and hang out with our friends. We don't always have to be at my house sitting
[10:21.490 --> 10:25.370]  at the tab table, we should be able to go somewhere else. There are so many stoners
[10:25.370 --> 10:29.650]  out there that I don't know, because they're all at their house on their couch taking dabs
[10:29.650 --> 10:32.930]  because they don't come to my house and sit on my couch and take dabs. So we're never
[10:32.930 --> 10:36.970]  going to meet if we had a social club, we'd go meet each other. So that way when somebody
[10:36.970 --> 10:40.570]  got tired of smoking, what am I smoking? If I got tired of smoking candy kush, I could
[10:40.570 --> 10:44.650]  go trade them my candy kush for some of their OG kush or whatever. And just make a nice
[10:44.650 --> 10:49.310]  little community a nice little network. I'm going to keep on with the article it says
[10:49.310 --> 10:54.950]  they found ready support in the ballot petitioning process turning in 10,700 signatures more
[10:54.950 --> 10:58.830]  than twice as many as needed. Although Denver police have shut down private cannabis clubs
[10:58.830 --> 11:03.430]  the city's marijuana policy office this year began examining as an evolving regulatory
[11:03.430 --> 11:08.050]  need the potential of allowing some social use of marijuana. The idea came up in council
[11:08.050 --> 11:12.710]  race races last spring with some successful candidates open to the idea in part because
[11:12.710 --> 11:17.250]  tourists lack places to consume their purchases legally. That's very true. You guys you can
[11:17.250 --> 11:20.770]  come to Colorado and if you're not from here, if you've got an out of state license, you
[11:20.770 --> 11:25.250]  can purchase up to seven grams of cannabis, you can purchase up to seven grams of hash,
[11:25.250 --> 11:29.410]  you can purchase seven grams total in any combination of edibles, hash, tinctures and
[11:29.410 --> 11:33.970]  topicals. But what you can't do once you've made the purchase, there's nowhere to fucking
[11:33.970 --> 11:37.490]  smoke. You can't go to the hotel and smoke because they don't allow smoking. You can't
[11:37.490 --> 11:41.850]  go to the park because that's illegal. Unless you know somebody, you just have all this
[11:41.910 --> 11:45.190]  cannabis that you can't smoke and you're not allowed to take it to your home state to smoke
[11:45.190 --> 11:49.790]  it because it's illegal to travel across state lines with it. So I think that this smoking
[11:49.790 --> 11:53.750]  lounge type of an environment is something that we really, really need. I'll continue
[11:53.750 --> 11:57.830]  with the article it says, but city efforts were in early stages when to vert and Brian
[11:57.830 --> 12:02.270]  Vicente of cannabis focus law firm Vicente Cederberg, both frustrated with what they
[12:02.270 --> 12:08.350]  saw as an action began to push for the initiative. To vert and several people involved in the
[12:08.350 --> 12:12.330]  recent talks say it's too soon to predict what will result. Options could range from
[12:12.330 --> 12:16.130]  a narrow ordinance that allows private clubs to a more extensive law that would break new
[12:16.130 --> 12:20.970]  ground in Colorado by allowing patrons of some bars to vape inside or smoke outside
[12:20.970 --> 12:26.190]  as the initiative proposed. The initiative withdrawal ensures we now have the time and
[12:26.190 --> 12:30.530]  ability to include all interested stakeholders to reach consensus on this important issue,
[12:30.530 --> 12:35.450]  said Councilman Albus Brooks, who represents most of downtown. I'm committed to working
[12:35.450 --> 12:39.790]  on a broadly acceptable solution, but finding common ground for an expansion of the current
[12:39.790 --> 12:44.330]  law, which restricts consumption mostly to private residents, might prove tricky. There's
[12:44.330 --> 12:49.310]  also the chance that a consensus proposal won't go far enough for the activists. While
[12:49.310 --> 12:54.190]  Mayor Michael Hancock's administration took no position on the proposed initiative, the
[12:54.190 --> 12:58.330]  city attorney's office questioned the legality of its scope, given state laws against public
[12:58.330 --> 13:04.070]  consumption that its lawyers viewed as conflicting. And Sonia Riggs, president and CEO of the
[13:04.070 --> 13:08.850]  Colorado Restaurant Association, expressed adamant opposition on behalf of about half
[13:08.850 --> 13:12.710]  of the state's restaurants, in part based on concerns that insurers might drop coverage
[13:12.710 --> 13:17.370]  of all restaurants because of liability concerns. This week, the Colorado Hotel and Lodging
[13:17.370 --> 13:21.870]  Association, Metro Denver Lodging Council, and Colorado Restaurant Association said in
[13:21.870 --> 13:26.650]  a statement that they appreciated the activists' withdrawal of the initiative. Our respective
[13:26.650 --> 13:31.210]  industries are committed to working with the proponents and the city to find a solution
[13:31.210 --> 13:35.650]  that reflects the interests and concerns of all stakeholders, their statement said.
[13:35.650 --> 13:39.510]  The proposed initiative divided Denver restaurant and bar owners who would have had the option
[13:39.510 --> 13:43.570]  to allow marijuana use. Riggs said Wednesday that she would approach the discussion with
[13:43.570 --> 13:47.930]  an open mind. I do understand there's a concern from their part that they need to have that
[13:47.930 --> 13:52.170]  they need to have addressed, she said of initiative backers, just as there's a concern from our
[13:52.170 --> 13:57.130]  side. For their part, city officials say they can't offer assurances. They also plan to
[13:57.130 --> 14:01.050]  gather input from neighborhood and community groups on the issue. We can't guarantee an
[14:01.090 --> 14:05.090]  outcome on it, obviously, but it's something we've been looking at, said Ashley Kilroy,
[14:05.090 --> 14:09.490]  Hancock's executive director for marijuana policy. We do believe that there's area for
[14:09.490 --> 14:13.770]  a conversation around this and that there's a lot of other considerations. Martinez said
[14:13.770 --> 14:18.530]  his office isn't drawing bright lines, allowing policymakers to consider all options first.
[14:18.530 --> 14:23.490]  I'm not going to throw down the legal hammer until we are specific proposals, he said,
[14:23.490 --> 14:28.010]  until there are specific proposals, he said. Sorry, the word proposals is out of the quotation,
[14:28.010 --> 14:32.290]  so that was confusing. Until our specific proposals, he said, adding, we're all working
[14:32.290 --> 14:36.930]  to find clarity within the law so that people can operate with certainty. If activists are
[14:36.930 --> 14:41.010]  dissatisfied with the coming decisions, though, they will have a fallback option, going back
[14:41.010 --> 14:45.770]  to the ballot on their own next year. In a presidential election that probably will have
[14:45.770 --> 14:50.810]  wider turnout than this fall, Tvert sees an even greater change for passage. But he said
[14:50.810 --> 14:55.890]  a successful compromise with city officials and other interests is more likely to result
[14:55.890 --> 15:01.050]  in a law that we know the city would be comfortable with and will not resist and will actually
[15:01.050 --> 15:06.370]  implement. So they pulled their ballot so that they can rewrite it to where they can
[15:06.370 --> 15:10.550]  actually make it a little bit more fair for the businesses and for the people who want
[15:10.550 --> 15:15.530]  to consume. So the law or the proposal is not dead, they're going to rewrite it, and
[15:15.530 --> 15:19.650]  they're going to try again. It sounds like the city of Denver wants to work with the
[15:19.650 --> 15:25.490]  cannabis consumers. It seems like they understand the revenue that is available. They understand
[15:25.490 --> 15:29.450]  the need. And they mentioned in this article that out of staters don't have anywhere to
[15:29.450 --> 15:34.130]  consume, which is the main problem here. If those out of staters had somewhere to consume,
[15:34.130 --> 15:37.130]  they would go there, they would consume, and then they're going to get hungry, they're
[15:37.130 --> 15:40.450]  going to get thirsty, and they're going to need entertainment, which is going to cause
[15:40.450 --> 15:45.690]  them or not cause them but yeah, we'll cause them to go spend more money and participate
[15:45.690 --> 15:50.330]  in our economy and be part of our state's cash flow a little better. All right, guys,
[15:50.330 --> 15:53.610]  I gotta go blow my nose. I'm catching a little bit of a head cold, but I will be right back.
[15:53.930 --> 15:57.450]  All right, guys, I am back. I apologize if my voice sounds a little bit nasally this
[15:57.450 --> 16:00.850]  week. I am catching a little bit of a head cold. I'm trying to fight it off. But like
[16:00.850 --> 16:05.350]  any other professional, the show must go on. So I'm doing the podcast and making the best
[16:05.350 --> 16:09.990]  of it for you. I appreciate you guys for tolerating my my little bit of sniffles and a little
[16:09.990 --> 16:13.710]  bit of a nasally voice. All right, I've got another news article here for you guys. This
[16:13.710 --> 16:18.970]  is grounds for celebration. This may become a holiday in Colorado if they continue to
[16:18.970 --> 16:24.410]  do this annually. The article here came from the cannabis and it was written by Kristen
[16:24.410 --> 16:30.090]  Wyatt from the Associated Press. And the headline says get ready for the one day tax holiday
[16:30.090 --> 16:34.290]  on Colorado weed. Excuse me guys, I got to take a drink here. Then we'll get the show
[16:34.290 --> 16:40.910]  on the road. All right, so the sub headline says we're thinking there will be huge crowds
[16:40.910 --> 16:46.390]  says a shop owner about the September 16 break on the hefty Colorado marijuana tax on recreational
[16:46.390 --> 16:51.510]  weed. Thanks to the Tabor law. Alright, so that sounds confusing to a lot of people.
[16:51.510 --> 16:56.350]  But taxes are ridiculously high on cannabis here in Colorado. And we're going to have
[16:56.350 --> 17:01.430]  a one day tax free cannabis day in Colorado. Let me read the article. I'll explain it to
[17:01.430 --> 17:06.430]  you. Colorado's unusual tax laws forcing the state to suspend taxes on recreational marijuana
[17:06.430 --> 17:12.070]  for one day. The sales tax breakdown, the sales tax break on September 16 will save
[17:12.070 --> 17:16.430]  $20 off the price of a mid grade ounce of pot in the Denver area where ounces this summer
[17:16.430 --> 17:22.490]  sell for about $200 before tax. It's unusual for a state that has many times rejected sales
[17:22.490 --> 17:28.070]  tax holidays on things like school supplies, clothing or any of energy efficient appliances.
[17:28.070 --> 17:33.070]  Officials say it could cost the state three to $4 million in one day you guys are going
[17:33.070 --> 17:39.310]  to lose three to $4 million in taxes in a single day. article goes on to say at first
[17:39.310 --> 17:43.590]  I was in disbelief we were doing this said Sherry Hackett who owns botanic care a dispensary
[17:43.590 --> 17:47.810]  in the Denver suburb of North Glenn. And he goes that's botanic care not botanic care the
[17:47.810 --> 17:52.470]  nutrient line. It's two separate businesses. Once our lawyers said no, we really are doing
[17:52.470 --> 17:56.910]  this we started getting ready. We're thinking there will be huge crowds packet is printing
[17:56.910 --> 18:01.590]  signs to alert customers to the holiday and is trying to boost inventory for a one day
[18:01.590 --> 18:06.350]  crush of businesses. Colorado's taxpayer Bill of Rights requires voter approval for new
[18:06.350 --> 18:12.990]  taxes. In 2013, a year after legalizing recreational pot voters approved the 25% taxes, but the
[18:12.990 --> 18:16.910]  law requires that any new taxes be waived and refunded if overall state collections
[18:16.910 --> 18:21.910]  exceed projections given to voters when they approve the new taxes. In this case, the pot
[18:21.910 --> 18:28.510]  taxes were projected to raise $70 million in 2014. They actually raised $58 million.
[18:28.510 --> 18:32.950]  But because overall tax collections that year exceeded protect projections, Colorado must
[18:32.950 --> 18:37.070]  ask voters for permission to keep the money and they comply with the requirement that
[18:37.070 --> 18:43.390]  the taxes revert to zero lawmakers settled on a short one day tax waiver. That day is
[18:43.390 --> 18:49.190]  September 16. One day after the state's books for the previous fiscal year are made final.
[18:49.190 --> 18:54.350]  Alright, so if you guys want to come to Colorado and buy a quarter of cannabis at a shop, September
[18:54.350 --> 18:59.310]  16 would be your day to do it. There will be no taxes. Marijuana won't be completely
[18:59.310 --> 19:04.630]  tax free that day. A regular 2.9% sales tax still applies as do medical marijuana taxes
[19:04.630 --> 19:10.770]  and local pot taxes. Alright, so the extra local taxes that we pay here in Pueblo will
[19:10.770 --> 19:15.590]  still be tacked on. For pot retailers, the holiday poses a bizarre supply dilemma. They'll
[19:15.590 --> 19:19.470]  want plenty of weed on hand to sell to throngs of pot shoppers. But if they stock too much
[19:19.470 --> 19:25.550]  product they'll forego their one day waiver on the 15% excise tax they pay marijuana wholesalers.
[19:25.550 --> 19:29.030]  A savvy retailer would want to have shelves full enough to supply crowds but bare enough
[19:29.030 --> 19:34.190]  to take maximum advantage of the restocking without paying excise taxes before the business
[19:34.190 --> 19:40.530]  closes September 16. Ryan Fox who owns two Denver dispensaries and also a wholesale pot
[19:40.530 --> 19:44.270]  growing company hasn't decided what sorts of deals to offer that day but he's anticipating
[19:44.270 --> 19:48.830]  a windfall. Our hopes are high and we're going to push as hard as we can to see as many customers
[19:48.830 --> 19:54.230]  as we can Fox said. Colorado voters will decide in November whether to keep the pot taxes.
[19:54.230 --> 19:58.990]  The 2013 taxing measure passed two to one and state politicians seemed confident voters
[19:58.990 --> 20:04.610]  will reauthorize the taxes. The state constitution requires refunds only in a new tax in a new
[20:04.610 --> 20:09.650]  taxes first year so voters won't be asked again. I read that a little weird so I'm going
[20:09.650 --> 20:15.550]  to read that last line again it says the state constitution requires refunds only in a new
[20:15.550 --> 20:19.990]  taxes first year so voters won't be asked again. I kind of read that funny the first
[20:19.990 --> 20:24.510]  time but this only comes up when a tax is in its first year so they won't be asking
[20:24.510 --> 20:28.390]  us this again. The one day tax break won't put too much of a dent in the state's overall
[20:28.390 --> 20:33.590]  pot revenue. Colorado's pot collections are blooming. Marijuana tax revenues jumped from
[20:33.590 --> 20:39.190]  25 million in the first five months of 2014 to 44 million in the first five months of
[20:39.190 --> 20:44.030]  this year. The increase has been attributed to additional stores opening. Colorado now
[20:44.030 --> 20:51.470]  has 380 recreational pot dispensaries and 480 licensed recreational pot growers up from
[20:51.470 --> 20:56.830]  a few dozen in the state's first months of retail recreational pot. And you guys those
[20:56.830 --> 21:03.670]  480 recreational growers are actually commercial grows that only vend to dispensaries recreational
[21:03.670 --> 21:08.050]  dispensaries that does not include private grows so there are a lot more private grows
[21:08.050 --> 21:12.670]  that are not counted. So you guys we made so much tax money that we have to give our
[21:12.670 --> 21:17.270]  state a tax break. All of the customers that come to buy cannabis on September 16th will
[21:17.270 --> 21:22.150]  not have to pay the regular cannabis tax. That's going to be awesome. So if you come
[21:22.150 --> 21:26.110]  from out of state we hope to see you at the spot dispensary on September 16th. If you
[21:26.110 --> 21:29.710]  come from out of state if you come from anywhere make sure you ask for me. I'll try to come
[21:29.710 --> 21:34.510]  out from the back and say hi shake your hand and see what's up. You know what I won't be
[21:34.510 --> 21:38.070]  at work on September 16th. That's funny. I won't be there so don't come to say hi to
[21:38.070 --> 21:42.430]  me. I'm seeing Morgan Heritage and Damian Marley and Taurus Riley on September 15th
[21:42.430 --> 21:46.710]  and there's a good chance I will not show up for work on the 16th. So enjoy your tax-free
[21:46.710 --> 21:51.470]  day without me. That sounds like fun. I've got another news article to read to you. I've
[21:51.470 --> 21:57.750]  actually got a couple more. Let's see how long we've been recording. You know what?
[21:57.750 --> 22:02.950]  Let's see we have been going 21 minutes. All right I can get two news articles in the next
[22:02.950 --> 22:07.630]  10 or 15 minutes. Let's do this. So this article I've got two articles that I'm going to read
[22:07.630 --> 22:12.510]  back to back. This one came out on September 8th and then the next article came out shortly
[22:12.510 --> 22:17.710]  after that. It came out on September 9th. So they are related articles. I'm going to
[22:17.710 --> 22:20.550]  go ahead and get into the first one. This is once again from The Cannabis written by
[22:20.550 --> 22:26.630]  David Magoya and Ricardo Baca. The headline says Denver recalls Mahatma pot extracts over
[22:26.630 --> 22:31.310]  unapproved pesticides. The order comes after an investigation by the Denver Post and lab
[22:31.310 --> 22:36.390]  testing revealed three unapproved pesticides in a pair of Mahatma concentrates products.
[22:36.390 --> 22:40.390]  The article goes on like this. State and Denver inspectors on Tuesday ordered a recall
[22:40.390 --> 22:44.350]  of marijuana extracts sold by Mahatma concentrates that the Denver Post revealed contained high
[22:44.350 --> 22:49.790]  levels of unapproved pesticides. Mahatma co-owner Brett Mauser confirmed the recall of products
[22:49.790 --> 22:54.110]  that were derived from marijuana plants grown by a supplier Treatments Unlimited. Treatments
[22:54.110 --> 22:58.150]  co-owner has acknowledged the Denver company used the unapproved pesticides. Treatments
[22:58.150 --> 23:02.950]  earlier this year had a number of its plants quarantined by city officials because of pesticides
[23:02.950 --> 23:09.470]  concerns concerns and later released. Tuesday's recall was ordered by the Denver Department
[23:09.470 --> 23:13.670]  of Environment or Environmental Health and the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division
[23:13.670 --> 23:18.150]  following a story by the post that revealed lab tests detected three unapproved pesticides
[23:18.150 --> 23:25.310]  in a pair of Mahatma products. The test commissioned by the post found levels of Oh gosh, myclobutanil
[23:25.310 --> 23:33.710]  and amid chloropid in Mahatma's black label grapefruit, black label grapefruit diesel
[23:33.710 --> 23:38.990]  wax that were six times the maximum amount allowed by federal government on any food
[23:38.990 --> 23:43.630]  product. The pesticides also were found in Mahatma's black label alpha blue shatter but
[23:43.630 --> 23:50.030]  at lower levels measurable amounts of avromectin were found in both samples. Only Mahatma products
[23:50.030 --> 23:56.790]  showing an origin number of 403-00114 on their labels are subject to the recall. It
[23:56.790 --> 24:01.470]  was unclear how many products with that origin number were sold. Mauser said he is preparing
[24:01.470 --> 24:07.050]  to handle return products. Hold placards were placed on locked storage units for when recalled
[24:07.050 --> 24:11.750]  product comes back into Mahatma, he told the post in an email. Once product reaches us
[24:11.750 --> 24:15.490]  on this recall, we will be sending it out for testing and once results are back and
[24:15.490 --> 24:19.510]  show past then the product will be released from the city of Denver's hold. If product
[24:19.510 --> 24:25.670]  does not pass, we will be quarantining and contacting the med for further instruction.
[24:25.670 --> 24:30.490]  Tuesday's actions are part of a supply chain investigation according to Dan Roland spokesman
[24:30.490 --> 24:35.770]  for Denver's office of marijuana policy adding that additional recalls are possible. Inspectors
[24:35.770 --> 24:40.050]  visited Mahatma's facilities and poured through records and products. An owner at Treatments
[24:40.050 --> 24:45.070]  which also operates Altitude the dispensary shops in Denver said he expects agency inspectors
[24:45.170 --> 24:50.670]  visit his facility on Wednesday. Pesticides typically are applied while a plant is growing,
[24:50.670 --> 24:54.930]  not after it has been harvested, dried and sold. The post investigation found Mahatma
[24:54.930 --> 24:58.750]  had inadvertently mislabeled its products to indicate the concentrate came from plants
[24:58.750 --> 25:04.150]  it had grown. The pesticides were not included in the product's labels list of ingredients.
[25:04.150 --> 25:08.510]  State law requires labels to reflect any pesticide or herbicide or contaminant that was used
[25:08.510 --> 25:14.330]  at any stage of a marijuana product's processing. Though the law also requires cannabis businesses
[25:14.330 --> 25:19.850]  to test for pesticides, that provision has not yet been enforced. Mouser previously said
[25:19.850 --> 25:24.370]  the businesses' labels are only as accurate as the information provided to them. We are
[25:24.370 --> 25:28.490]  going by what our clients give us as far as an ingredient list, he told the post. We go
[25:28.490 --> 25:33.090]  over the ingredients list and we check that list again against the approved pesticides
[25:33.090 --> 25:38.130]  list. If we find something that isn't on the list, we notify the processing client.
[25:38.130 --> 25:43.850]  The pesticides found in the post tests are among hundreds if Colorado Department of Agriculture
[25:43.850 --> 25:47.570]  has not approved for use on marijuana because product labels restrict their use to certain
[25:47.570 --> 25:53.450]  plant and crops or to specific locations such as open fields and residential gardens. Because
[25:53.450 --> 25:57.090]  marijuana is illegal under federal law, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will
[25:57.090 --> 26:02.410]  not certify any pesticide for use on cannabis nor allow any testing. As a result, there
[26:02.410 --> 26:06.790]  are no safety limits established for their use specific to cannabis or their ingestion
[26:06.790 --> 26:12.450]  by consumers. However, the products are allowed on other consumable items such as strawberries,
[26:12.450 --> 26:17.890]  tomatoes, and grapes, though the level of pesticide residues allowed on each does vary.
[26:17.890 --> 26:22.690]  The post found pesticides levels as much as six times the highest amount allowed on an
[26:22.690 --> 26:28.170]  edible food product and as high as 1,800 times the level Denver officials allowed to be on
[26:28.170 --> 26:34.450]  released plants it had quarantined earlier this year over pesticide concerns. This plant
[26:34.450 --> 26:41.370]  had 1,800 times the level that Denver allowed to be released. This plant had been sprayed
[26:41.370 --> 26:45.610]  to shit. Whatever material they used, these guys were spraying the fuck out of it all
[26:45.610 --> 26:49.690]  the time and way too concentrated. This is crazy. I don't know what kind of bugs they
[26:49.690 --> 26:53.370]  were trying to treat for, but they are not quality farmers. I'll go on with the article.
[26:53.370 --> 26:57.330]  It says, enforcement of the state's list of allowable pesticides is sporadic at best with
[26:57.330 --> 27:02.490]  most city and state officials responding to complaints rather than inspecting each facility.
[27:02.490 --> 27:06.250]  Colorado had about five years of medical marijuana cultivation and sales before the state in
[27:06.250 --> 27:12.330]  2013 began compiling a list of which pesticides could be used on the plants. Officials admit
[27:12.330 --> 27:17.930]  that reflects an imperfect system. Colorado's marijuana SAR, Andrew Friedman, said the state
[27:17.930 --> 27:23.210]  is dealing with the problem as best it can. Many growers are new to regulated pesticide
[27:23.210 --> 27:28.370]  use. Beyond that, like banking, the pesticide regulatory system is heavily built on federal
[27:28.370 --> 27:33.650]  involvement, said Friedman, director of Governor John Hickenlooper's Office of Marijuana Coordination.
[27:33.650 --> 27:37.770]  I know that's not a completely satisfying answer, and honestly, I wish we had these
[27:37.770 --> 27:43.010]  challenges solved by day one, but we're working toward an enforceable solution that also protects
[27:43.010 --> 27:48.610]  consumers from other contaminants such as molds. So you guys, they are trying to keep
[27:48.610 --> 27:52.690]  the cannabis safe. They're testing it now to find out what is in it. They're figuring
[27:52.690 --> 27:56.290]  out what pesticides we should and should not be using. They're setting levels. They're
[27:56.290 --> 28:00.370]  trying to keep the consumer safe. We have taken this out of the basement. We've put
[28:00.370 --> 28:04.690]  it into the store, and now we're putting it into laboratories. I hope this shows that
[28:04.690 --> 28:10.850]  Colorado is doing our best to make a legitimate business out of cannabis. This isn't just
[28:10.850 --> 28:15.290]  weed anymore. This is a product. This is a commercial product that's being tested. I'm
[28:15.290 --> 28:19.730]  impressed, but at the same time, I'm bummed out that there are well-known companies like
[28:19.730 --> 28:24.570]  Mahatma that are still screwing it up and mislabeling and making mistakes like this.
[28:24.570 --> 28:28.170]  Mahatma has won cannabis cups. I have done business with Mahatma, and they've always
[28:28.170 --> 28:32.430]  been super kind to me. So it's a little disappointing to see an industry leader come out and make
[28:32.430 --> 28:36.370]  a mistake like this. They will get it together. They'll get their shit together. And like
[28:36.370 --> 28:40.610]  they said, they were only going by the labels that they were given by the growers. So that
[28:40.610 --> 28:44.170]  was probably not their fault. I want to go ahead and give them the benefit of the doubt.
[28:44.170 --> 28:50.250]  Mahatma didn't do this on purpose. They were just going off of labels. So this next article
[28:50.250 --> 28:57.050]  is completely related to this. A lot of this testing and pesticide testing and safety inspections
[28:57.050 --> 29:02.530]  have all stemmed from a few small incidents, but it has sparked a lot of investigation,
[29:02.530 --> 29:07.770]  and it is going to improve our industry, in my opinion. So I'm going to read another article
[29:07.770 --> 29:12.330]  that came out the day after the last article. This one says, Colorado State Ag officials
[29:12.330 --> 29:16.830]  launch probes on pesticides. Colorado Department of Agriculture has investigations underway
[29:16.830 --> 29:22.470]  on pesticide misuse by Denver marijuana businesses, Mahatma concentrates, and Treatments Unlimited.
[29:22.470 --> 29:25.810]  So this is pretty much a follow-up of the last article I read. This is again by David
[29:25.810 --> 29:32.810]  Magoya and Ricardo Baca. And the article goes like this. Colorado agriculture officials
[29:32.810 --> 29:36.730]  have opened an investigation into a marijuana grow operation named in a report by the Denver
[29:36.730 --> 29:42.130]  Post about pesticide residues, and they confirmed a second business named in the story was already
[29:42.130 --> 29:46.850]  under scrutiny. It is unclear which of the two companies, Mahatma concentrates or Treatments
[29:46.850 --> 29:50.890]  Unlimited, both in Denver, was already under scrutiny, and officials with the Colorado
[29:50.890 --> 29:55.810]  Department of Agriculture would not elaborate. But the agency said investigations into other
[29:55.810 --> 30:02.330]  businesses' use of pesticides is the focus of its probe. The CDA has one ongoing investigation
[30:02.330 --> 30:06.250]  with one of the growers, and based on the information supplied in the article, we have
[30:06.250 --> 30:10.610]  opened a second investigation into the other named grower to determine if their pesticide
[30:10.610 --> 30:16.050]  use is in compliance with the Colorado Pesticide Applicators Act, CDA spokeswoman Kristi Lightcap
[30:16.050 --> 30:20.450]  said in an email. Penalties on the growers could range from a simple order to stop the
[30:20.450 --> 30:25.770]  prohibited conduct to fines up to $1,000 for each violation. Under the act, repeat
[30:25.770 --> 30:30.010]  offenders fines are doubled and chronic offenders face potential license sanctions, Lightcap
[30:30.010 --> 30:34.890]  said. Although laws require marijuana businesses to test for pesticide residues, that rule
[30:34.890 --> 30:39.650]  has not only has not been enforced because only one facility is certified to do that
[30:39.650 --> 30:44.250]  analysis. Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division rules show marijuana that tests positive for
[30:44.250 --> 30:49.330]  unapproved pesticides and other contaminants must be destroyed or decontaminated. Because
[30:49.330 --> 30:54.130]  I don't know how to decontaminate cannabis, you can't really wash it off, so I think your
[30:54.130 --> 30:58.730]  option is to destroy it. The Post on Tuesday reported that two of eight lab tests it commissioned
[30:58.730 --> 31:03.970]  on marijuana extracts found three unapproved pesticides and products made by Mahatma. Although
[31:03.970 --> 31:07.770]  Mahatma labels indicated the tainted marijuana used to make these extracts came from its
[31:07.770 --> 31:12.490]  own grow facility, documents showed the cannabis actually came from Treatments. A Treatments
[31:12.490 --> 31:18.050]  co-owner admitted that the company had used products that contained the unapproved pesticides.
[31:18.050 --> 31:30.050]  The City of Denver's Treatments, which operates a pair of Altitude the Dispensary shops in Denver, was one of 11 marijuana growers to have about 100,000 plants quarantined earlier this year by Denver health officials over pesticide concerns.
[31:30.050 --> 31:43.050]  The city allowed most of the plants back into commerce, including those grown by Treatments, when levels of pesticide residues dropped to the lowest amount allowed on food crops. Two other businesses destroyed the plants rather than wait for pesticide test results.
[31:43.050 --> 31:55.050]  CDA's announcement on Wednesday came a day after the Denver Department of Environmental Health issued a broad recall of Mahatma products following a visit to that shop. Inspectors were expected to be at Treatments' growing warehouse on Wednesday.
[31:55.050 --> 32:09.050]  Retailers with recalled products were instructed to remove them from store shelves and either destroy the products in compliance with MED regulations or return the products to the manufacturer, said Dan Roland, spokesman for the Denver's Office of Marijuana Policy.
[32:09.050 --> 32:20.050]  Consumers should either destroy any recalled product they have or return it to the store of purchase, Roland said. This information of potential pesticide misuse is concerning, Lightcap said in an announcing investigation.
[32:20.050 --> 32:36.050]  The CDA has identified a list of products that can be used on marijuana and it has been available to growers for well over one year. Pesticides on marijuana is a controversial topic because no science exists to say which products are safe for consumers.
[32:37.050 --> 32:48.050]  Although several pesticides are approved for use on some fruit and vegetable crops, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cannot say whether they are safe on marijuana because the plant is illegal under federal law.
[32:48.050 --> 32:59.050]  CDA has compiled a list of pesticides, some of them so non-toxic that they do not require federal registration, that can be used on marijuana based on their label restrictions, not on their safety.
[32:59.050 --> 33:10.050]  It is a violation of federal law to use any pesticide contrary to its label directions. CDA has chosen those products whose label restrictions were so broad that using them on marijuana would not be in violation.
[33:10.050 --> 33:20.050]  But CDA officials have constantly said they do not recommend using pesticides on marijuana, nor will they say those products that appear on its list of approved pesticides are safe to consumers.
[33:21.050 --> 33:30.050]  We are in a completely new business here and we're building a space shuttle that has not been done anywhere else, Colorado Agricultural Commissioner Don Brown said.
[33:30.050 --> 33:38.050]  Other states, including New Hampshire, have restricted pesticides allowed on marijuana only to those so non-toxic that federal registration is not required.
[33:39.050 --> 33:53.050]  Colorado nearly did the same, but the industry argued that non-toxic pesticides, mainly organics such as neem, cinnamon, and peppermint oils, weren't nearly strong enough to combat effectively the pests and mildews that most commonly attack their crop.
[33:54.050 --> 34:06.050]  I'm kind of torn by pesticides because I run a commercial grow and we cannot lose a million dollar harvest to bugs. So we have to do something to keep bugs off of it.
[34:06.050 --> 34:16.050]  I agree with this last statement here that organics such as neem oil, cinnamon and peppermint oils, and rosemary oil is something and cedar oil is also something commonly used.
[34:16.050 --> 34:28.050]  Those oils are great as a preventative. Those are wonderful on a small scale grow. Unfortunately, those types of oils will end up in your concentrate, just like all of these pesticides.
[34:28.050 --> 34:39.050]  I can taste neem oil in your dabs. If you spray neem oil on your plants early before flower or just before flower or early into flower, I can taste the neem oil in your extracts.
[34:40.050 --> 34:52.050]  Recently I had some dabs given to me by an artist. He wanted me to sample them and I could taste the rosemary oil in his concentrate. So using essential oils isn't always the cure and all the preventative the answer also.
[34:52.050 --> 35:03.050]  Sometimes you have to use some type of a pesticide, especially when you're getting clones from other people. That's where I find I get the bugs the most often is when I get a clone as a gift from another grower.
[35:03.050 --> 35:18.050]  It almost always has some kind of a bug on it. So when you get a new clone, that's what I treat with. I use heavy shit depending on what the clone is and what bugs I see on it. But I will use some pretty radical treatment because I cannot risk my mother plants getting spider mites.
[35:18.050 --> 35:31.050]  I cannot risk my mother plants getting broad mites. I'm a breeder. I rely on my mother plants. That is my future. That is my work. I've spent years developing those mother plants. If bugs destroyed those, I would be devastated.
[35:32.050 --> 35:47.050]  So I do understand the need for a little bit of a stronger pesticide in a commercial environment. Something that I have recently started doing, I am studying for a Department of Agriculture pesticide applicators test.
[35:48.050 --> 36:01.050]  I think anybody that is spraying pesticides in any type of a garden should have to at least examine this test. You don't have to pass it. I work in a commercial facility. I will be training new employees on pesticide safety. I'm required to take this test.
[36:02.050 --> 36:17.050]  I would encourage anybody who is going to play with pesticides to take this test. It will teach you a lot about pesticide safety to start with. How to handle a pesticide. How to apply a pesticide safely. What to wear when you're doing it. But it will also teach you what is in almost everything.
[36:18.050 --> 36:30.050]  There are very few chemicals that they're using in all these brands. They're just different brands with different labels. It's the same chemical in almost everything. And if you learn what chemicals kill which bugs, it makes your job a lot easier.
[36:31.050 --> 36:48.050]  I recommend studying up on this pesticide test. Go to your state's Department of Agriculture website and see if there is an applicator test. Anybody who does a job like an exterminator or something like that has to pass this test so it's available in your area. It will help you combat your pest problems a lot better and it will also keep you safe.
[36:49.050 --> 36:53.050]  Just something I recommend. It's something I'm doing so do it with me. It will be fun. We can do it together.
[36:54.050 --> 37:10.050]  My point with these articles is that we are not screwing around here in Colorado. We are actually testing products to make sure that things are safe. We have stepped up our game. I'm going to see a lot of businesses fall apart because of all this new regulation with pesticide testing.
[37:10.050 --> 37:26.050]  A lot of the growers that think they are master growers and pro growers are not going to know what to do once they start getting rid of some of the pesticides. We're going to have to start using an integrated pest management system with live insects. It's going to be a whole different ballgame pretty soon.
[37:26.050 --> 37:45.050]  I'm going to write that down because that sounds like a good episode idea. We could talk about integrated pest management on a whole other episode. I'm writing a note of that. IPM. We'll try to get Sean over to talk about organic integrated pest management. That will be great.
[37:45.050 --> 38:00.050]  Alright guys let's see how long I've been talking. I feel like I've been going for at least 35 minutes. Let's see 37 minutes. I think that's a long podcast. You guys like to listen to about 36 minutes worth of show before you get bored. It is time for me to wrap up this episode. I want to thank everybody for joining me. I really appreciate you guys listening to me.
[38:00.050 --> 38:23.050]  Especially today. I've got a little bit of a stuffy nose so I'm sure my voice is a little bit nasally. So I do appreciate you for sticking through this episode. Thanks for listening to all the news. I will be back on Monday with another episode for you. I'm putting together the CBD episode I've been talking about. I'm putting together three or four episodes. They're all here in this notebook. Of course now we're going to talk about integrated pest management in a future episode. So look forward to that.
[38:23.050 --> 38:52.050]  Hey guys I'm going to wrap it up. What do I say at the end of the show? Oh yeah that part about going to iTunes. Go into the iTunes store. Search for Grow From Your Heart podcast and give me a five star rating and type in a review and let me know what you think of the show. That would be really cool. The more people that give the show a rating and a good review the more people see the show. The more people see the show the more people start growing better cannabis. The more people that are growing better cannabis which means the more quality cannabis is available which means weed will get cheaper and it's just a good thing.
[38:52.050 --> 39:13.050]  Everyone will be able to smoke cheaper cannabis. We'll all have an abundance of weed. We can overgrow the government. So just share the show. Go click like on it. Give me a comment. Let me know what you think. More people will see it. More people will listen. And then maybe one day you'll be somewhere and somebody will smoke some weed with you and you'll be like where'd you learn to grow this? And they'll be like I listened to that podcast. And then you'll be like damn me too. And then everyone will have great weed because of the show. It'll be awesome.
[39:14.050 --> 39:34.050]  Alright you guys I'm rambling. I'm running out of breath. Make sure you find me on all the social media sites. I would love all that. I'm on Facebook. I'm on Twitter. I'm on Instagram. The Facebook is Grow From Your Heart. The Twitter is at GFYH Podcast. And on Instagram you have to follow I Read Genetics. That's my seed company. Please follow I Read Genetics. I post a lot of great cannabis photography.
[39:34.050 --> 39:45.050]  Alright you guys that's all I've got for today. My throat is burnt. My voice is shot. So I'm going to give a big huge shout out to my ninja spence. Thanks again for listening and until next time take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
[40:28.640 --> 40:32.640]  This world you keep for the sake of the children and future.
[40:36.640 --> 40:44.640]  Most agile we know we've all seen but leave a snap to destroy all things for the sake of the children and future.
[40:48.640 --> 40:49.640]  We hear you.
[40:52.640 --> 40:53.640]  I'm in the street.
[40:58.640 --> 40:59.640]  I'm in the street.
[41:06.640 --> 41:08.640]  The children is destruction for the children.
[41:10.640 --> 41:11.640]  We need for the children.
[41:19.640 --> 41:20.640]  We need you now more than.
[41:25.640 --> 41:26.640]  Too much.

[41:37.640 --> 41:38.640]  More love.
[41:41.640 --> 41:42.640]  Again.
[41:47.640 --> 41:48.640]  Street again.
[41:49.640 --> 41:50.640]  United.
[41:54.640 --> 41:55.640]  From the children.
[41:57.640 --> 41:58.640]  Love is all we need.
[42:07.640 --> 42:08.640]  We need you now more than.
[42:13.640 --> 42:14.640]  Too much.
[42:19.640 --> 42:20.640]  Too much.
[42:25.640 --> 42:26.640]  Let's.
[42:37.640 --> 42:38.640]  Pray for.
[42:49.640 --> 42:50.640]  We need you now more than.
[42:56.640 --> 42:57.640]  More than.
[43:01.640 --> 43:02.640]  Too much.
