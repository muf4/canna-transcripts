[00:18.880 --> 00:21.220]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:21.220 --> 00:23.020]  It's time for episode number 73
[00:23.020 --> 00:24.860]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:24.860 --> 00:28.580]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:28.580 --> 00:30.560]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.560 --> 00:32.620]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:32.620 --> 00:33.940]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:33.940 --> 00:35.140]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:35.140 --> 00:36.860]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.860 --> 00:39.540]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.540 --> 00:40.500]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.500 --> 00:41.880]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:41.880 --> 00:44.020]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.020 --> 00:44.940]  to the Mystic Roots Band
[00:44.940 --> 00:46.260]  for letting me use their music on the show.
[00:46.260 --> 00:50.300]  Huge thanks to Cat Coop and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:50.300 --> 00:51.140]  What's up, guys?
[00:51.140 --> 00:52.180]  I'm gonna turn that music down.
[00:52.180 --> 00:53.180]  Well, I'm gonna turn it down a lot.
[00:53.180 --> 00:54.020]  It's kind of loud.
[00:54.020 --> 00:55.220]  There we go.
[00:55.220 --> 00:56.900]  Trying to get the party started.
[00:56.900 --> 00:58.020]  Speaking of getting the party started,
[00:58.020 --> 01:01.180]  big shout out to my friends, Deez, Roxy.
[01:01.180 --> 01:02.140]  Let's see, who else is on there?
[01:02.140 --> 01:03.860]  I'm gonna check on something real quick.
[01:03.860 --> 01:05.460]  I'll talk more about this later, maybe.
[01:05.460 --> 01:07.360]  Shout out to Kenny, shout out to Cody,
[01:07.360 --> 01:11.020]  and shout out to Cody, another Cody, two Codys,
[01:11.020 --> 01:11.900]  and Roxy also.
[01:11.900 --> 01:13.300]  I don't know if I said that.
[01:14.580 --> 01:15.980]  Those are some of the friends of mine
[01:16.700 --> 01:18.940]  that are watching me record this show live right now
[01:18.940 --> 01:19.860]  on Bong TV.
[01:19.860 --> 01:20.700]  They can't hear the show,
[01:20.700 --> 01:24.380]  but they are watching me record it on my webcam.
[01:24.380 --> 01:26.340]  I was in the chat room getting pumped up,
[01:26.340 --> 01:27.660]  just getting a little energy before the show,
[01:27.660 --> 01:29.060]  taking a couple dabs, and I thought,
[01:29.060 --> 01:30.020]  why turn off the cam?
[01:30.020 --> 01:31.300]  Why not just let those guys watch?
[01:31.300 --> 01:32.740]  So when you guys hear this,
[01:32.740 --> 01:34.100]  this is the episode that you're watching
[01:34.100 --> 01:35.700]  that you watched past tense.
[01:35.700 --> 01:38.980]  All right, anyway, shout out to the Bong TV crew.
[01:38.980 --> 01:40.980]  There are no ads for this episode, you guys.
[01:40.980 --> 01:42.420]  We're not even gonna do any commercials.
[01:42.420 --> 01:44.780]  We're gonna get right down to business.
[01:44.780 --> 01:47.620]  I've been promising you guys a lesson
[01:47.620 --> 01:50.340]  on how to set up a perpetual grow,
[01:50.340 --> 01:51.900]  and I actually took a lot of time
[01:51.900 --> 01:53.660]  and figured out how to do that.
[01:53.660 --> 01:55.660]  I think I've got it figured out for you.
[01:57.220 --> 01:58.580]  Man, my arms are a little bit rubbery.
[01:58.580 --> 02:00.480]  I'm working through my paperwork here.
[02:00.480 --> 02:04.260]  I played my drums for about a good solid hour.
[02:04.260 --> 02:07.180]  I beat the shit out of those drums, and I needed that.
[02:07.180 --> 02:08.020]  That was kind of nice.
[02:08.020 --> 02:09.340]  I haven't played the drums in quite a while.
[02:09.340 --> 02:11.380]  I needed to make some space where the drums were
[02:11.380 --> 02:14.220]  for some grow things, of course,
[02:14.260 --> 02:15.700]  but then I had that space available.
[02:15.700 --> 02:18.180]  I set up a big, I'm just talking about the drum set
[02:18.180 --> 02:20.380]  on the podcast, you guys, I'm sorry.
[02:20.380 --> 02:21.660]  Anyway, I'm gonna tell you more about it.
[02:21.660 --> 02:24.940]  I started, I've got an eight, a 10, a 12,
[02:24.940 --> 02:29.420]  14, 16-inch toms, 22-inch kick drum, 14-inch snare drum.
[02:29.420 --> 02:31.620]  I just tore the shit out of that kit all day today.
[02:31.620 --> 02:32.460]  It was like an hour.
[02:32.460 --> 02:33.440]  It felt like all day.
[02:33.440 --> 02:34.280]  I'm gonna quit rambling.
[02:34.280 --> 02:37.360]  I'm gonna find the notes here that are in my phone,
[02:37.360 --> 02:40.380]  and we will talk about this grow lesson
[02:40.380 --> 02:41.360]  that I wrote for you.
[02:41.360 --> 02:42.380]  Let's see, all right, I found it.
[02:42.380 --> 02:43.900]  We'll get to the point here, you guys.
[02:44.580 --> 02:45.420]  I'm super dabbed out.
[02:45.420 --> 02:47.240]  I'm just trying to talk through the dabness here
[02:47.240 --> 02:50.100]  for a minute and find my way through these clouds.
[02:50.100 --> 02:51.260]  Shout out to the Mystic Roots crew.
[02:51.260 --> 02:52.340]  Here we go.
[02:52.340 --> 02:55.260]  So episode 73, scheduling a perpetual flow.
[02:55.260 --> 02:57.460]  When you're scheduling a perpetual grow,
[02:57.460 --> 02:59.100]  a few things you need to keep in mind
[02:59.100 --> 03:00.900]  are things like your plant count.
[03:00.900 --> 03:04.980]  If you're in a medical state like Colorado, where I am,
[03:04.980 --> 03:07.320]  you have a plant count, and you have to stay within that
[03:07.320 --> 03:08.700]  to be legal.
[03:08.700 --> 03:10.520]  This will be a good way to help you stay
[03:10.520 --> 03:12.920]  within your plant count and produce the amount of medicine
[03:12.920 --> 03:15.720]  or recreational cannabis you need to supply yourself.
[03:17.520 --> 03:19.040]  So that's something you need to think about.
[03:19.040 --> 03:22.200]  How much herb do you require to keep yourself supplied
[03:22.200 --> 03:23.280]  without trying to be stingy,
[03:23.280 --> 03:25.860]  without trying to make a bunch of money?
[03:25.860 --> 03:28.120]  How much do you realistically want to grow,
[03:28.120 --> 03:29.800]  and how often do you need to grow it?
[03:29.800 --> 03:31.080]  That's gonna be something we're gonna talk about
[03:31.080 --> 03:32.400]  in a minute.
[03:32.400 --> 03:35.180]  Also, we will talk about how much space it's gonna take.
[03:35.180 --> 03:37.400]  That's what will really dictate your grow.
[03:38.200 --> 03:40.120]  A lot of this stuff is covered in previous episodes,
[03:40.120 --> 03:42.080]  you guys, but we're gonna go back over a lot of it,
[03:42.160 --> 03:44.520]  and we will, by the end,
[03:44.520 --> 03:48.920]  you will have a perpetual grow going if you follow this,
[03:48.920 --> 03:50.800]  I guess it's a recipe I wrote here.
[03:50.800 --> 03:51.640]  Anyway.
[03:52.760 --> 03:55.840]  Holy shit, excuse my throat clearing there.
[03:55.840 --> 03:58.440]  This perpetual lesson is going to be based
[03:58.440 --> 04:01.780]  on one 1,000-watt flowering light.
[04:01.780 --> 04:03.040]  This covers about a four-by-four
[04:03.040 --> 04:05.940]  or a five-by-five square foot area.
[04:05.940 --> 04:07.960]  So we're trying to create a perpetual grow
[04:07.960 --> 04:09.080]  that suits your needs.
[04:09.080 --> 04:11.740]  If you're using more lights, simply multiply this method
[04:12.420 --> 04:13.780]  by however many lights you're using,
[04:13.780 --> 04:15.740]  or however you seem necessary.
[04:15.740 --> 04:16.980]  If you have questions, email me,
[04:16.980 --> 04:18.780]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
[04:18.780 --> 04:21.940]  and we'll help adjust this recipe for your grow room.
[04:21.940 --> 04:23.820]  I'll tell you about my perpetual grow.
[04:23.820 --> 04:28.820]  I run a four-light setup, and I fill the whole light area
[04:29.620 --> 04:33.280]  with a set of plants and harvest one light every two weeks.
[04:33.280 --> 04:34.680]  So here's where you need to make a decision
[04:34.680 --> 04:36.400]  on your perpetual setup.
[04:36.400 --> 04:38.660]  You need to decide if you want to start a crop
[04:38.660 --> 04:41.900]  under a light and finish the entire crop,
[04:41.900 --> 04:43.940]  and then have another set of plants ready
[04:43.940 --> 04:46.220]  as soon as that's done for you,
[04:46.220 --> 04:48.200]  so that as soon as you chop down that room,
[04:48.200 --> 04:50.340]  that light of plants, you have plants
[04:50.340 --> 04:51.580]  that were in veg in another room.
[04:51.580 --> 04:53.260]  As soon as they're done,
[04:53.260 --> 04:54.900]  do you want to refill the entire room,
[04:54.900 --> 04:57.460]  or do you want to kind of stagger it a little bit?
[04:59.620 --> 05:01.000]  I think it's a little, in my opinion,
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.940]  I like having a perpetual instead of having
[05:02.940 --> 05:05.100]  a whole bunch of herb to harvest all at one time.
[05:05.100 --> 05:07.800]  It can be a really daunting task, in my opinion,
[05:07.800 --> 05:11.880]  to try to harvest four lights worth of cannabis all at once.
[05:13.280 --> 05:14.800]  Gosh, guys, excuse my throat clearing.
[05:14.800 --> 05:18.800]  That'll go away here after a couple of minutes, I hope.
[05:18.800 --> 05:20.640]  All right, so if you're working with one strain,
[05:20.640 --> 05:21.480]  where was I?
[05:21.480 --> 05:22.320]  Let's see.
[05:22.320 --> 05:23.520]  Yeah, you need to decide if you want to start
[05:23.520 --> 05:25.160]  the whole crop and run the whole thing.
[05:25.160 --> 05:25.980]  Where was I?
[05:25.980 --> 05:27.120]  You want to stagger your crops,
[05:27.120 --> 05:29.600]  so you have a harvest every 30 days or two weeks.
[05:29.600 --> 05:32.280]  If you're working with one strain, that's a lot easier.
[05:32.280 --> 05:35.160]  If you've got multiple strains, try to get strains
[05:35.240 --> 05:38.200]  that you're going to have to time it.
[05:38.200 --> 05:41.080]  So try to get strains that are all about eight to nine weeks.
[05:41.080 --> 05:46.080]  That's your ideal setup for perpetual cycle under one light.
[05:46.800 --> 05:50.720]  So our main goal here is to have the rooms moving constantly
[05:50.720 --> 05:52.240]  with as little downtime as possible
[05:52.240 --> 05:54.200]  to keep your production at its maximum
[05:54.200 --> 05:56.240]  without any interruptions.
[05:56.240 --> 05:58.880]  That way you don't have any interruptions in your medicine.
[05:58.880 --> 06:00.280]  So I told you guys, let's see,
[06:00.280 --> 06:01.680]  I talked a little bit about my four light.
[06:01.680 --> 06:05.560]  My personal grow is a perpetual setup.
[06:05.560 --> 06:07.480]  I harvest one light every two weeks.
[06:07.480 --> 06:09.560]  Like I was saying, I'd rather trim one light worth of buds,
[06:09.560 --> 06:11.720]  which for me is a pound, than four lights,
[06:11.720 --> 06:13.640]  which would be four pounds easily.
[06:13.640 --> 06:15.100]  Sometimes it's a pound and a half.
[06:15.100 --> 06:15.940]  Sometimes it's more,
[06:15.940 --> 06:17.840]  just depends on what strains I'm running.
[06:17.840 --> 06:19.520]  So I'm harvesting every two weeks.
[06:19.520 --> 06:21.680]  It means that every two weeks I'm cutting clones.
[06:21.680 --> 06:24.200]  I'm doing transplants.
[06:24.200 --> 06:26.520]  I'm taking clones out of the cloner,
[06:26.520 --> 06:29.840]  putting them into cups, and I'm harvesting every two weeks.
[06:29.840 --> 06:33.720]  So I have four flowering lights in my flowering area.
[06:33.720 --> 06:35.200]  I have two lights in my vegging area,
[06:35.200 --> 06:38.520]  and I have a separate light for my moms and clones.
[06:38.520 --> 06:42.640]  I have about every 14 days, I cut 12 clones.
[06:42.640 --> 06:44.660]  After 14 days, those clones go into cups
[06:44.660 --> 06:48.200]  and go under a light in my mom and clone area.
[06:48.200 --> 06:50.440]  This could be like a T5 or a metal halide light,
[06:50.440 --> 06:52.280]  or even an LED if you're into that.
[06:53.520 --> 06:55.520]  Those plants that I cut will stay in the cups
[06:55.520 --> 06:57.480]  for about two weeks before they're transplanted
[06:57.480 --> 06:59.000]  into seven gallon pots.
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.600]  And you guys, I'm gonna give you a lot of detail about this.
[07:00.600 --> 07:01.800]  I know I'm going kind of fast right now.
[07:01.800 --> 07:02.880]  I'm giving you a setup on mine,
[07:02.880 --> 07:05.120]  and then I'll get into a lot of detail in a minute.
[07:05.120 --> 07:07.480]  So I can fit 12 seven gallon pots
[07:07.480 --> 07:09.080]  under my two veg lights comfortably.
[07:09.080 --> 07:11.000]  That gives them enough space.
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.800]  And keep in mind, some of these are,
[07:13.720 --> 07:16.400]  we got shit all the way from one week up to eight weeks old.
[07:16.400 --> 07:18.680]  So the ones on the far end there, they're real little.
[07:18.680 --> 07:19.880]  So we can squish those together.
[07:19.880 --> 07:21.480]  And the other ones over there on that end
[07:21.480 --> 07:23.560]  are a little larger, so they need more space.
[07:23.560 --> 07:24.720]  I can fit 12 of them.
[07:26.760 --> 07:28.240]  Once the plants are in the seven gallon pots,
[07:28.280 --> 07:30.920]  they'll hang out in the bedroom for like 30 to 45 days,
[07:30.920 --> 07:32.600]  depending on the strain.
[07:32.600 --> 07:33.960]  If you're gonna set up this perpetual,
[07:33.960 --> 07:36.720]  it'll probably work out to exactly eight weeks
[07:36.720 --> 07:38.200]  if you do this right.
[07:38.200 --> 07:40.720]  I use large pots so I can keep big plants
[07:40.720 --> 07:41.880]  and keep my plant count down.
[07:41.880 --> 07:42.880]  Like I was talking about earlier,
[07:42.880 --> 07:45.200]  Colorado is limited by plant counts.
[07:45.200 --> 07:48.200]  So getting as much from each plant is important.
[07:48.200 --> 07:50.880]  As much as you can from each plant is important.
[07:50.880 --> 07:53.360]  So I have four sets of seven gallon pots
[07:53.360 --> 07:55.240]  under my veg lights.
[07:55.240 --> 07:56.680]  And I would have plants in veg
[07:56.720 --> 07:58.360]  for two, four, six, and eight weeks.
[07:58.360 --> 08:00.280]  And the plants that have been in veg for eight weeks
[08:00.280 --> 08:02.960]  will go into the flower room on week nine.
[08:02.960 --> 08:05.360]  And more plants will be dropped into seven gallon pots.
[08:05.360 --> 08:07.840]  Everything will be slid over four spaces.
[08:07.840 --> 08:10.400]  And the empty spaces I just made will be replaced.
[08:10.400 --> 08:12.600]  And it'll be Tetrised all right over the left
[08:12.600 --> 08:15.280]  so that it's right by the door to the next room.
[08:15.280 --> 08:17.440]  So like I said, every two weeks I'm harvesting a light,
[08:17.440 --> 08:19.920]  I'm cutting more clones, I'm putting clones into cups,
[08:19.920 --> 08:22.600]  putting cups into pots, and I'm keeping the cycle moving
[08:22.600 --> 08:26.760]  while maintaining a pest management regimen.
[08:26.760 --> 08:30.140]  I'm lollipopping these plants, I'm doing pruning.
[08:30.140 --> 08:31.520]  It's a lot of work to do in there, you guys.
[08:31.520 --> 08:33.960]  You can't just slack off, but it's a lot of work
[08:33.960 --> 08:35.520]  and it pays off every two weeks.
[08:35.520 --> 08:37.760]  I've got a pound of herb harvested for myself
[08:37.760 --> 08:39.960]  every two weeks if I do this properly.
[08:39.960 --> 08:42.080]  So that's basically my setup there.
[08:42.080 --> 08:43.680]  You guys might not have four lights.
[08:43.680 --> 08:47.080]  So let's talk about getting your perpetual plant.
[08:47.080 --> 08:49.160]  I gotta reach over and plug this phone in.
[08:49.160 --> 08:52.600]  All right, so to have a perpetual grow,
[08:52.600 --> 08:53.880]  you'll need a solid mother plant
[08:53.880 --> 08:56.160]  or a source of reliable clones.
[08:56.160 --> 08:58.120]  I don't wanna rely on somebody else for clones.
[08:58.120 --> 09:01.440]  I would definitely recommend keeping a mother plant
[09:01.440 --> 09:02.480]  if you have a mother plant.
[09:02.480 --> 09:04.720]  Maybe if I haven't talked thoroughly enough
[09:04.720 --> 09:06.360]  about mother plants, I'm gonna write a note right now.
[09:06.360 --> 09:07.200]  I need a pen.
[09:09.280 --> 09:11.740]  I'll write a note to talk about mother plants in the future
[09:11.740 --> 09:14.120]  and then we can kind of talk about keeping a mom.
[09:14.120 --> 09:15.480]  That'll be a whole nother episode.
[09:15.480 --> 09:17.880]  Writing it down, mother plant episode, boom.
[09:19.360 --> 09:20.740]  I know it takes me a long time to write,
[09:20.740 --> 09:22.440]  but I'd rather be able to read it later.
[09:22.440 --> 09:24.160]  There we go, mother plants, I wrote that.
[09:24.160 --> 09:25.780]  So have a good mother plant.
[09:27.920 --> 09:29.080]  I'll talk about selecting a mom.
[09:29.080 --> 09:30.780]  I'll go way into depth on that for you if I haven't.
[09:30.780 --> 09:33.200]  So for this mother plant,
[09:33.200 --> 09:35.120]  for the mother plant, you need a light cycle
[09:35.120 --> 09:36.720]  that stays on in a vegetative cycle.
[09:36.720 --> 09:39.120]  I recommend, of course, the 18 on and six off,
[09:39.120 --> 09:42.220]  or you can try 19.5 if that works for you.
[09:43.160 --> 09:45.320]  I do that because I see the plant's growing
[09:45.320 --> 09:48.140]  and it keeps any sativas from auto flowering.
[09:48.140 --> 09:50.140]  I've had some sativas that like to auto flower
[09:50.140 --> 09:52.740]  if the light cycle changes just a little.
[09:52.740 --> 09:54.540]  And that 19.5, that extra hour,
[09:54.540 --> 09:56.040]  will keep them from doing that.
[09:57.060 --> 09:59.480]  So you can keep your mother plants and your clones
[09:59.480 --> 10:01.840]  and these cups on the same cycle.
[10:01.840 --> 10:03.660]  If you have one light, you can fit.
[10:03.660 --> 10:06.180]  If you have one good size fluorescent light,
[10:06.180 --> 10:09.520]  you can fit your cloner and a bunch of cups
[10:09.520 --> 10:11.900]  with clones in there underneath that T5.
[10:11.900 --> 10:13.900]  And you can probably fit a good size mother plant
[10:13.900 --> 10:15.940]  underneath there also if you do it right.
[10:16.820 --> 10:19.940]  I know two of those T5 fixtures would definitely do it.
[10:20.860 --> 10:25.860]  All right, so for this example, Mike and I were talking
[10:27.380 --> 10:29.460]  and of course I had to ask Mike for some help
[10:29.460 --> 10:30.340]  because I was getting stuck.
[10:30.340 --> 10:32.680]  So shout out to Mike for helping me.
[10:32.680 --> 10:37.000]  He came up with the idea to use two five by five grow tents
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.060]  because that's when he met me, I was growing in grow tents.
[10:40.060 --> 10:42.220]  He learned a lot from those grow tents.
[10:42.220 --> 10:44.580]  So we're using two of those five by five grow tents.
[10:44.580 --> 10:47.100]  If you don't have grow tents, you can use a bedroom
[10:47.100 --> 10:49.780]  or whatever and you can divide it into two spaces.
[10:49.780 --> 10:53.020]  As long as your flowering space is totally dark
[10:53.020 --> 10:55.260]  during the night cycle, you'll be okay.
[10:55.260 --> 10:57.840]  I can't stress enough how important it is
[10:57.840 --> 11:00.860]  to have a totally dark night cycle
[11:00.860 --> 11:02.520]  in your flowering room, okay?
[11:03.400 --> 11:05.420]  So we're gonna use two five by five tents, right?
[11:05.420 --> 11:08.000]  And you can use a bedroom, you can divide it out.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.780]  So one is a flowering hut.
[11:10.780 --> 11:12.100]  I said that right, one's a veg space,
[11:12.100 --> 11:13.540]  one's a flowering hut.
[11:13.580 --> 11:14.980]  All right, so we've got the one flowering space.
[11:14.980 --> 11:17.180]  It's a five by five with a thousand watt light in there.
[11:17.180 --> 11:20.420]  Our other room is a five by five room or tent.
[11:20.420 --> 11:22.540]  That'll be our veg and mom space.
[11:22.540 --> 11:25.300]  All right, so it's actually gonna take a couple of weeks
[11:25.300 --> 11:28.200]  to get your perpetual grow flowing and productive.
[11:28.200 --> 11:30.740]  But once it starts, the flow should run perfectly
[11:30.740 --> 11:33.620]  if you plan ahead and stay on top of your chores.
[11:33.620 --> 11:36.080]  Don't get lazy, don't get complacent.
[11:36.080 --> 11:38.780]  You have to stay in there and be on top of things.
[11:38.780 --> 11:42.340]  So in my example, we're gonna set up a perpetual grow
[11:42.340 --> 11:45.700]  to harvest one large plant every two weeks.
[11:45.700 --> 11:48.940]  And your goal is four ounces per plant with this method.
[11:48.940 --> 11:51.340]  So we're gonna put one seven gallon pot
[11:51.340 --> 11:52.600]  under the light every two weeks.
[11:52.600 --> 11:54.540]  We need to start with a mother plant or some clones.
[11:54.540 --> 11:56.780]  So in this case, we'll start with a healthy mom.
[11:56.780 --> 12:00.100]  You should have your mom's, your mom rooms or huts
[12:00.100 --> 12:02.180]  built and running before we even take the first clone
[12:02.180 --> 12:03.720]  for the perpetual grow.
[12:03.720 --> 12:05.500]  So you've got your rooms happy
[12:05.500 --> 12:06.980]  and your mother plant is nice and healthy.
[12:06.980 --> 12:08.900]  Now we cut clones to start our cycles.
[12:08.900 --> 12:11.020]  I don't know if you're using like rapid routers
[12:11.020 --> 12:12.620]  or if you're using rock wool cubes
[12:12.620 --> 12:13.740]  or if you're using an easy cloner,
[12:13.740 --> 12:17.420]  but either way, two weeks is your due date for these clones.
[12:17.420 --> 12:20.580]  They've gotta be rooted and ready to rock in two weeks.
[12:20.580 --> 12:24.660]  If you're not proficient in cloning,
[12:24.660 --> 12:27.180]  I would recommend cutting these clones early.
[12:27.180 --> 12:29.100]  So take some practice, get some practice
[12:29.100 --> 12:29.980]  and get some clones going.
[12:29.980 --> 12:32.120]  So we've got the five by five hut.
[12:32.120 --> 12:36.220]  That's one 1000 watt flowering light and five by five area.
[12:36.220 --> 12:38.220]  So this is what would happen on week one.
[12:38.220 --> 12:41.040]  We would cut clones and let them root.
[12:41.040 --> 12:42.740]  And if for this one light situation,
[12:42.740 --> 12:45.520]  we only need one clone out of this whole setup.
[12:45.520 --> 12:49.140]  So cut some clones and hopefully in 14 days,
[12:49.140 --> 12:50.640]  one of those clones is rooted.
[12:51.820 --> 12:54.320]  So now week two, you don't have much to do
[12:54.320 --> 12:57.020]  except make sure the clones are rooted and happy.
[12:57.020 --> 12:59.900]  So week three of the perpetual cycle,
[12:59.900 --> 13:01.640]  you're gonna take more clones.
[13:03.200 --> 13:04.420]  Okay, first you have to, I guess,
[13:04.420 --> 13:06.160]  take the clones out of the cloning area,
[13:06.160 --> 13:07.260]  put them into cups.
[13:07.260 --> 13:09.900]  And then you're also gonna cut more clones for the next run
[13:09.900 --> 13:12.360]  and you're only gonna need one keeper again.
[13:12.360 --> 13:14.020]  So those clones that you just put into cups,
[13:14.020 --> 13:16.500]  you're gonna let them go for 14 more days
[13:16.500 --> 13:18.260]  and then you'll just pick the best one.
[13:18.260 --> 13:20.540]  And the clones that you just put in the cloner in 14 days,
[13:20.540 --> 13:22.500]  you're gonna pick the best one of those.
[13:22.500 --> 13:24.780]  All right, so we only need one at a time to survive,
[13:24.780 --> 13:26.180]  but cut extras you guys,
[13:26.180 --> 13:28.980]  because it's always better to have some to choose from.
[13:30.020 --> 13:32.660]  So week four, week four is another chill week,
[13:32.660 --> 13:35.140]  but make sure the cups and the clones are happy
[13:35.140 --> 13:36.640]  and as healthy as you can make them.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.360]  And the mother plant, you need,
[13:38.360 --> 13:39.880]  so, ooh, I didn't add that in here, you guys.
[13:39.880 --> 13:41.760]  We're gonna need to make love to the mother plant
[13:41.760 --> 13:42.600]  every once in a while.
[13:42.600 --> 13:44.740]  You gotta get in there and trim that sexy bitch up.
[13:44.740 --> 13:46.640]  So I guess taking clones every two weeks,
[13:46.640 --> 13:48.240]  you'll be able to do that.
[13:48.240 --> 13:49.880]  Something I should have made a note of.
[13:49.880 --> 13:51.400]  All right, week five.
[13:51.400 --> 13:53.760]  Week five is where we start to get busy, you guys.
[13:53.760 --> 13:55.880]  We need to put the clones into cups of dirt.
[13:55.880 --> 13:57.600]  We need to cut more clones.
[13:58.680 --> 14:02.000]  We only need one keeper, like I said, every two weeks,
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  but I would take a few extras and choose from the best.
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.640]  I wrote that down a lot of times.
[14:05.640 --> 14:08.080]  The plants that we put into cups two weeks ago
[14:08.080 --> 14:10.340]  will now go into seven-gallon pots
[14:10.340 --> 14:12.720]  and go under the veg lights.
[14:12.720 --> 14:14.120]  If you're in that five-by-five hut,
[14:14.120 --> 14:16.440]  you should have plenty of room for your mother plant,
[14:16.440 --> 14:19.320]  a little bit of clones, a couple of cups,
[14:19.320 --> 14:21.040]  and four seven-gallon pots.
[14:21.040 --> 14:22.440]  It'll work, trust me.
[14:22.440 --> 14:26.860]  So in week five, we're gonna put one seven-gallon pot
[14:26.860 --> 14:28.160]  under the veg lights,
[14:28.160 --> 14:30.120]  and that's gonna sit there for eight weeks, you guys,
[14:30.120 --> 14:33.040]  but now you have your first veg plant in veg.
[14:33.040 --> 14:34.080]  You're showing some progress.
[14:34.080 --> 14:35.760]  You got that one little itty-bitty plant
[14:35.760 --> 14:38.840]  in a seven-gallon pot, and it's only taken five weeks.
[14:38.840 --> 14:41.440]  So week six is kind of another chill week,
[14:41.440 --> 14:43.800]  but you have to make sure all your plants are looking good
[14:43.800 --> 14:45.380]  because now you're really setting the pace
[14:45.380 --> 14:46.520]  for your productivity.
[14:47.560 --> 14:49.520]  Don't forget to watch for bugs.
[14:49.520 --> 14:52.080]  Start doing any pruning and training that you wanna do.
[14:52.080 --> 14:53.960]  Make sure you're getting good on your cloning game.
[14:53.960 --> 14:56.120]  You've had a lot of practice by now.
[14:56.120 --> 14:57.520]  So just start perfecting shit.
[14:57.520 --> 14:59.320]  Start really paying attention to details now.
[14:59.320 --> 15:00.600]  You have a rhythm going.
[15:00.600 --> 15:02.140]  Start paying attention to things.
[15:02.140 --> 15:04.060]  Let's move into week seven.
[15:04.900 --> 15:05.740]  I'm doing pretty good.
[15:05.740 --> 15:06.620]  I'm at about 16.
[15:06.620 --> 15:07.620]  Yeah, after a couple of edits here,
[15:07.620 --> 15:09.580]  we should be at about 15 minutes.
[15:09.580 --> 15:10.520]  So week seven.
[15:11.820 --> 15:14.180]  For week seven, we need to put the clones
[15:14.180 --> 15:16.060]  out of the cloning area into cups,
[15:16.060 --> 15:18.140]  and then we need to cut more clones.
[15:18.140 --> 15:21.160]  Remember, guys, we just need one, but cut several.
[15:21.160 --> 15:23.900]  Then we need to put another clone into a seven-gallon pot,
[15:23.900 --> 15:26.640]  and then that goes under that veg light,
[15:26.640 --> 15:29.540]  and now we have two of our first four plants
[15:29.540 --> 15:31.220]  under the veg light,
[15:31.220 --> 15:33.500]  and the first one has seven more weeks,
[15:33.500 --> 15:36.500]  or no, it's got, yeah, we're going on odd numbers, right?
[15:36.500 --> 15:38.940]  So it would have six more weeks to cook
[15:38.940 --> 15:40.460]  before it's gonna go,
[15:40.460 --> 15:42.020]  the first one's got a few more weeks to cook
[15:42.020 --> 15:44.020]  before it's gonna go into the veg room,
[15:44.020 --> 15:45.260]  and this one's now got eight,
[15:45.260 --> 15:46.340]  so the other one's got six, yeah,
[15:46.340 --> 15:49.000]  because we're gonna be harvesting every two weeks.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.260]  So week eight is another week to focus on training
[15:52.260 --> 15:53.660]  and pruning and plant health
[15:53.660 --> 15:55.300]  and keeping your mother plant happy,
[15:55.300 --> 15:56.760]  checking for bugs,
[15:56.760 --> 15:58.220]  going in there and cleaning up the bottoms
[15:58.220 --> 16:01.060]  of all the plants that are in the vegging area.
[16:01.060 --> 16:02.540]  There's stuff to do every week,
[16:02.540 --> 16:04.660]  even though we're not doing the big cycle
[16:04.660 --> 16:06.620]  on the even-numbered weeks.
[16:06.620 --> 16:09.480]  So week nine, I'm sure you're catching on by now.
[16:09.480 --> 16:11.620]  Take the clones out of the cloner,
[16:11.620 --> 16:12.780]  put them into cups,
[16:12.780 --> 16:13.940]  cut new clones,
[16:13.940 --> 16:16.500]  put a clone from a cup into a seven-gallon pot
[16:16.500 --> 16:17.480]  and into the veg area.
[16:17.480 --> 16:19.260]  So now you've got three seven-gallon pots
[16:19.260 --> 16:20.500]  under the veg light.
[16:20.500 --> 16:22.820]  One of them's getting big and bushy by now,
[16:22.820 --> 16:25.200]  and it's almost time to flower that bitch.
[16:25.200 --> 16:26.940]  If you wanna do any topping or anything
[16:26.940 --> 16:29.220]  or any pruning to it, now's a good time.
[16:30.140 --> 16:31.900]  Week 10 is another off week,
[16:31.900 --> 16:34.820]  but it's a good time to check for bugs.
[16:34.820 --> 16:36.380]  We've been going at it for 10 weeks now,
[16:36.380 --> 16:38.820]  so check all of your equipment out.
[16:38.820 --> 16:41.060]  Clean up all your fans.
[16:41.060 --> 16:42.500]  Make sure the floor is clean.
[16:42.500 --> 16:44.940]  Just get in there and clean everything up on week 10.
[16:44.940 --> 16:47.500]  Week 11, here we go again.
[16:47.500 --> 16:49.760]  We're gonna put clones into cups.
[16:49.760 --> 16:51.060]  We're gonna cut more clones.
[16:51.060 --> 16:52.980]  We're gonna put our favorite clone
[16:52.980 --> 16:55.460]  into a seven-gallon pot
[16:55.460 --> 16:56.820]  and put that into the veg area.
[16:56.820 --> 16:59.820]  So now you have got four seven-gallon pots
[16:59.820 --> 17:01.340]  and your room is full,
[17:01.340 --> 17:04.740]  and we will flower out our first plant in two weeks.
[17:04.740 --> 17:06.100]  And I know that sounds like a long time.
[17:06.100 --> 17:08.700]  It's gonna take us 13 weeks to flower our first plant
[17:08.700 --> 17:11.000]  before we even start flowering our first plant.
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.160]  But trust me, once you get this rhythm going,
[17:13.160 --> 17:14.980]  it's totally gonna be worth it.
[17:14.980 --> 17:16.700]  So week 12, this is the last week
[17:16.700 --> 17:18.180]  before you start flowering plants.
[17:18.180 --> 17:20.700]  Make sure your bloom room is ready.
[17:20.700 --> 17:24.120]  Have that five-by-five flowering room cleaned up, sparkly.
[17:24.120 --> 17:25.440]  Make sure the floor is clean.
[17:25.440 --> 17:27.080]  Make sure the ceiling is clean.
[17:28.260 --> 17:29.100]  Clean it all.
[17:29.100 --> 17:29.920]  Clean it again.
[17:29.920 --> 17:32.040]  Even if you did, go in there and clean it again.
[17:32.040 --> 17:34.160]  And then after that, clean it one more time.
[17:34.160 --> 17:36.400]  And then inspect it one more time and find what you missed,
[17:36.400 --> 17:37.680]  because there is something that you missed.
[17:37.680 --> 17:40.360]  Do you have a fire extinguisher near your grill?
[17:40.360 --> 17:43.400]  Do you have a smoke detector near your grill?
[17:43.400 --> 17:45.700]  Those are probably two things you forgot about.
[17:45.700 --> 17:47.160]  I don't wanna see your home.
[17:47.160 --> 17:48.560]  I don't even wanna say what could happen.
[17:48.560 --> 17:49.920]  You know what I'm getting at, right?
[17:49.920 --> 17:52.080]  So get a smoke detector, put it near your grill,
[17:52.080 --> 17:54.360]  get a fire extinguisher, and put it outside of the room
[17:54.360 --> 17:55.800]  so that in the worst-case scenario,
[17:55.800 --> 17:58.200]  you don't have to run in there to get the fire extinguisher
[17:58.200 --> 17:59.820]  to put the fucking fire out.
[18:00.520 --> 18:01.740]  Have it outside of the room.
[18:01.740 --> 18:03.820]  Yeah, just do that for me, please.
[18:03.820 --> 18:05.620]  So your room is ready.
[18:05.620 --> 18:06.460]  You're ready.
[18:06.460 --> 18:07.280]  The plants are ready.
[18:07.280 --> 18:09.140]  Week 13, here we go, you guys.
[18:09.140 --> 18:10.940]  This is when it gets fun.
[18:10.940 --> 18:13.420]  This is the first day we start the flowering cycle.
[18:13.420 --> 18:16.060]  Today, you get to move that largest plant
[18:16.060 --> 18:19.380]  into the flowering room and begin the bloom phase.
[18:19.380 --> 18:22.720]  And now in eight to nine weeks, hopefully 60 days,
[18:22.720 --> 18:24.660]  we'll have buds to harvest.
[18:24.660 --> 18:28.820]  And then every two weeks after that, you can harvest.
[18:28.820 --> 18:30.820]  If you keep this rhythm going properly.
[18:32.340 --> 18:34.500]  I'm serious about the scheduling of this.
[18:34.500 --> 18:37.380]  If you fuck this up, you will be way behind
[18:37.380 --> 18:40.300]  and everything will fall apart because you will miss a beat
[18:40.300 --> 18:41.880]  and you won't know where to jump back on.
[18:41.880 --> 18:43.700]  It's like playing a really fast song.
[18:43.700 --> 18:45.880]  And once you jumped off that beat,
[18:45.880 --> 18:47.840]  it's gonna take a minute to recover
[18:47.840 --> 18:49.760]  and your lungs and your smoking habits
[18:49.760 --> 18:52.220]  are definitely gonna notice.
[18:52.220 --> 18:55.060]  So check it out, week 13, move that big plant
[18:55.060 --> 18:55.900]  that you've been working on
[18:55.900 --> 18:58.180]  that's been in veg for eight weeks now.
[18:58.180 --> 18:59.900]  That plant was in veg for eight weeks,
[18:59.900 --> 19:03.540]  in a cup for two weeks and in a cloner for two other weeks,
[19:03.540 --> 19:05.000]  12 weeks of life.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.980]  And now you're just now moving that sucker
[19:06.980 --> 19:08.680]  into the flowering room.
[19:08.680 --> 19:12.100]  So after you move that into the flowering room,
[19:12.100 --> 19:14.260]  feed it it's flowering nutrients.
[19:14.260 --> 19:15.700]  You gotta feed it flowering nutrients.
[19:15.700 --> 19:18.660]  We've talked about what to feed and stuff on week one.
[19:18.660 --> 19:21.500]  So feed that plant it's flowering nudes.
[19:22.740 --> 19:24.880]  Then you have to, you guessed it,
[19:24.880 --> 19:27.880]  take a clone out of the cloner, put it into a cup,
[19:28.580 --> 19:29.840]  cut more clones, put your favorite cup
[19:29.840 --> 19:32.900]  into a seven gallon pot and replace that seven gallon pot
[19:32.900 --> 19:34.700]  that you just moved into the flowering room
[19:34.700 --> 19:37.400]  with a fresh pot and a little baby plant in it.
[19:37.400 --> 19:40.080]  So now you've got one plant in flower
[19:40.080 --> 19:42.380]  and you should have four plants in veg.
[19:42.380 --> 19:43.960]  Now our goal is to keep this moving
[19:43.960 --> 19:46.600]  and add a plant into the room every two weeks.
[19:46.600 --> 19:49.640]  You'll need to cut clones, put clones into cups,
[19:49.640 --> 19:51.540]  put a cup into a seven gallon pot,
[19:51.540 --> 19:55.060]  drag a fresh plant into the flowering room every two weeks.
[19:55.060 --> 19:59.040]  And eventually you will also be harvesting a plant
[19:59.040 --> 20:02.820]  every two weeks if you're running a 56 to 60 day strain.
[20:04.560 --> 20:07.960]  Yes, if that went right, that means that every two weeks
[20:07.960 --> 20:10.480]  you'll be pulling off about a quarter pound of herb
[20:10.480 --> 20:12.600]  for yourself if you do this properly.
[20:12.600 --> 20:15.880]  It will become a small part-time job for yourself
[20:15.880 --> 20:19.200]  to maintain this, but the more work and love you put into it
[20:19.200 --> 20:21.880]  the better your product will be, I promise you.
[20:21.880 --> 20:23.900]  Some people are like, how is your herb so good?
[20:23.920 --> 20:26.160]  And I'm like, I go in the grow room for hours every day.
[20:26.160 --> 20:28.700]  I touch every single plant with my hands.
[20:28.700 --> 20:30.100]  I look on the bottoms of the leaves.
[20:30.100 --> 20:31.440]  I walk in there in the morning and I'm like,
[20:31.440 --> 20:33.840]  which plant haven't I spent enough time with?
[20:33.840 --> 20:36.360]  And I pick one and I turn the leaves upside down
[20:36.360 --> 20:37.880]  and I look at the bottoms of the leaves
[20:37.880 --> 20:39.520]  and make sure there are no bugs.
[20:39.520 --> 20:42.240]  And I look around the room and I just stare into the room
[20:42.240 --> 20:44.440]  like an old guy staring off the porch into nothing.
[20:44.440 --> 20:46.720]  But I'm looking around the room to see if there's a problem
[20:46.720 --> 20:49.520]  that maybe I didn't miss, or maybe if there's something
[20:49.520 --> 20:51.880]  I could tweak to make the airflow a little bit better
[20:51.880 --> 20:53.580]  to control the temperature and the humidity
[20:54.240 --> 20:56.280]  just a little bit better when I'm away.
[20:56.280 --> 20:57.100]  I don't know.
[20:57.100 --> 21:00.160]  So be in there, do some work, keep on top of it.
[21:00.160 --> 21:01.600]  I don't even know what the fuck started that rant,
[21:01.600 --> 21:02.440]  I'm sorry.
[21:02.440 --> 21:04.320]  So after eight weeks, it'll be time to harvest
[21:04.320 --> 21:06.720]  that first plant that you put into your flowering room.
[21:06.720 --> 21:09.760]  It may need a few extra days for the plant to finish.
[21:09.760 --> 21:12.280]  Just squeeze that plant in there for the last few days.
[21:12.280 --> 21:15.600]  Or if you have this available, put that plant
[21:15.600 --> 21:19.560]  in its own dark room for two days before you harvest it
[21:19.560 --> 21:21.360]  and it will kind of dense up the buds
[21:21.380 --> 21:24.060]  and I think it'll kind of make it a little more resinous.
[21:24.060 --> 21:26.740]  I think it does make it kind of more dense
[21:26.740 --> 21:27.580]  is the word for it.
[21:27.580 --> 21:29.040]  It tightens up a little bit.
[21:29.040 --> 21:31.260]  That 48 hours of dark kind of shocks the plant
[21:31.260 --> 21:32.860]  and makes it kick out the last bit of resin
[21:32.860 --> 21:34.060]  that it can put out.
[21:34.060 --> 21:37.100]  It's getting freaked out, it knows it's gonna die.
[21:37.100 --> 21:39.380]  So now you should have a full perpetual setup
[21:39.380 --> 21:41.180]  that should yield three to five ounces of herb
[21:41.180 --> 21:42.460]  every two weeks.
[21:42.460 --> 21:45.220]  And if you do this right, you can keep your plant count
[21:45.220 --> 21:48.700]  down to like 10 or 15 if you only have one mother plant
[21:48.700 --> 21:50.060]  and you get good at cloning.
[21:50.080 --> 21:54.360]  Because you're gonna have four in flower
[21:54.360 --> 21:56.320]  and then you're gonna have four in your veg area.
[21:56.320 --> 21:57.240]  That's eight plants.
[21:57.240 --> 21:58.840]  Then you've got your mother plant
[21:58.840 --> 22:01.080]  and then you've got that one that's in a cup.
[22:01.080 --> 22:02.840]  That's 10 plants right there.
[22:02.840 --> 22:04.920]  If you take a couple of extra clones
[22:04.920 --> 22:06.760]  and have a couple of extra mother plants or whatever,
[22:06.760 --> 22:09.360]  you know, that's gonna put you up near 15 or 20.
[22:09.360 --> 22:12.600]  But dude, you're pulling a quarter pound of herb
[22:12.600 --> 22:14.160]  with 10 plants in your house
[22:14.160 --> 22:17.440]  and you're using two, maybe three lights doing this.
[22:17.440 --> 22:18.480]  See, that's gonna work.
[22:18.500 --> 22:20.060]  That's gonna work for you guys.
[22:20.060 --> 22:21.180]  If you have any questions, let me know.
[22:21.180 --> 22:23.580]  So your other option here would be to veg
[22:23.580 --> 22:26.340]  all four of your plants for 30 to 45 days
[22:26.340 --> 22:28.660]  and throw them all into the flowering room.
[22:28.660 --> 22:30.700]  And it's a good idea, but like I was saying,
[22:30.700 --> 22:32.500]  when it comes to harvesting all that pot,
[22:32.500 --> 22:34.460]  you're hopefully gonna pull off a pound of weed here,
[22:34.460 --> 22:36.140]  you guys, maybe a pound and a quarter.
[22:36.140 --> 22:38.340]  Oh my God, I just burped that root beer right into the mic.
[22:38.340 --> 22:39.180]  I'm sorry.
[22:39.180 --> 22:41.460]  Rude, rude, rude, rockstar.
[22:41.460 --> 22:42.880]  You're hoping to pull a pound and a quarter,
[22:42.880 --> 22:44.500]  pound and a half of herb off that.
[22:44.500 --> 22:46.300]  I would rather trim, you know,
[22:46.300 --> 22:48.720]  three to five ounces every two weeks
[22:48.720 --> 22:49.960]  and give my wrist a break,
[22:49.960 --> 22:52.200]  than be at it trimming for two weeks straight.
[22:52.200 --> 22:53.880]  Cause it gets crazy.
[22:53.880 --> 22:55.320]  You start cutting down plants
[22:55.320 --> 22:57.120]  and they're all ripe at the same time.
[22:57.120 --> 22:59.140]  And so you got shit drying all at the same time.
[22:59.140 --> 23:00.240]  You go into panic mode.
[23:00.240 --> 23:02.680]  You got to trim this whole pound of herb.
[23:02.680 --> 23:04.780]  I trim usually myself and one,
[23:04.780 --> 23:06.440]  maybe two other people at the table
[23:06.440 --> 23:08.600]  cause it just gets crowded and it gets loud.
[23:08.600 --> 23:12.040]  And I'd rather keep it peaceful and have less people here.
[23:12.040 --> 23:14.240]  Just kind of quiet for my head.
[23:14.240 --> 23:16.020]  So that's why I do the perpetual grow.
[23:16.740 --> 23:17.580]  It's a little bit better.
[23:17.580 --> 23:20.120]  And then it also makes you feel like something's happening.
[23:20.120 --> 23:24.140]  Instead of waiting 60 days for that damn crop to finish,
[23:24.140 --> 23:25.080]  you can, oh, it's cool.
[23:25.080 --> 23:26.280]  I've got one in two weeks.
[23:26.280 --> 23:27.760]  So it doesn't feel like it's so long.
[23:27.760 --> 23:29.760]  Of course the next crop is 60 days,
[23:29.760 --> 23:32.160]  but since I started one 40 days ago
[23:32.160 --> 23:34.000]  and then what's 40 minus 14,
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.060]  I fucked myself picking a weird number like that.
[23:36.060 --> 23:40.040]  But since I picked one seven weeks ago and started it,
[23:40.040 --> 23:41.560]  then I'm going to have one in two weeks.
[23:41.560 --> 23:44.200]  And then I'm going to have one in two weeks after that.
[23:44.200 --> 23:45.160]  You know, I thought I had,
[23:45.420 --> 23:47.980]  I'm rambling cause I took a lot of fat dabs and this.
[23:47.980 --> 23:48.860]  Yeah. Anyway.
[23:49.860 --> 23:52.380]  So if you choose to run them all at one time,
[23:52.380 --> 23:55.740]  you should have plants in that bedroom ready to flower
[23:55.740 --> 23:57.580]  as soon as that room is empty.
[23:57.580 --> 24:00.380]  So you're going to have to keep a mother plant
[24:00.380 --> 24:03.280]  and then four pots,
[24:03.280 --> 24:05.700]  four seven gallon pots for about eight weeks.
[24:05.700 --> 24:08.900]  So you'll need clones for two weeks, cups for two weeks.
[24:08.900 --> 24:11.620]  I need four of them, four clones, four cups,
[24:11.620 --> 24:12.640]  two weeks each.
[24:13.500 --> 24:15.420]  And then you throw those into the seven gallon pots
[24:15.420 --> 24:17.460]  and let those go for eight weeks.
[24:17.460 --> 24:20.380]  And then when you chop that other room,
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.460]  you throw those plants in there that same day.
[24:25.840 --> 24:26.900]  That's the only way to keep it going
[24:26.900 --> 24:27.880]  if you want to do it all at once,
[24:27.880 --> 24:30.980]  or you can do two plants every 30 days
[24:30.980 --> 24:31.940]  if that's easier for you.
[24:31.940 --> 24:34.180]  If you'd rather have a half a pound of herb every 30 days,
[24:34.180 --> 24:35.020]  you could do that.
[24:35.020 --> 24:36.420]  As this is completely adjustable.
[24:36.420 --> 24:38.060]  This was just the best I could come up with
[24:38.060 --> 24:40.220]  since I don't know your garden.
[24:40.220 --> 24:41.300]  I hope you find it useful.
[24:41.300 --> 24:42.820]  I hope you put it to use.
[24:42.820 --> 24:44.900]  I hope you start pulling off
[24:44.900 --> 24:47.820]  somewhere between three and five ounces for yourself
[24:47.820 --> 24:50.740]  or your patients every two weeks.
[24:50.740 --> 24:52.320]  That's a good supply of medicine for you.
[24:52.320 --> 24:53.920]  If you're smoking more than that,
[24:55.500 --> 24:56.420]  well, I can't judge.
[24:56.420 --> 24:57.740]  Smoke more than that, fuck it.
[24:57.740 --> 24:59.500]  I'm not even going to try to judge you for it.
[24:59.500 --> 25:01.120]  You might have some reason.
[25:01.120 --> 25:04.760]  You might have hardcore dab syndrome like I do.
[25:04.760 --> 25:06.740]  All right, you guys, I've been going for close to 30 minutes.
[25:06.740 --> 25:09.340]  I really appreciate you guys listening to the show.
[25:09.340 --> 25:10.820]  I've been taunting you and teasing you
[25:11.340 --> 25:12.380]  about this perpetual grow episode.
[25:12.380 --> 25:14.100]  You can see why it took me a minute.
[25:14.100 --> 25:16.940]  It took me 13 weeks to get to the flowering cycle.
[25:16.940 --> 25:18.320]  I feel like it went really quickly
[25:18.320 --> 25:19.660]  with all of the stuff that I wrote.
[25:19.660 --> 25:21.620]  If I skipped anything, please correct me.
[25:21.620 --> 25:22.460]  Let me know.
[25:23.980 --> 25:25.220]  You pay so much more attention
[25:25.220 --> 25:26.660]  when I do like a 30 minute episode.
[25:26.660 --> 25:30.640]  So I'm going to start wrapping up the show like a fat joint.
[25:30.640 --> 25:31.820]  You guys, thanks a lot for listening.
[25:31.820 --> 25:35.920]  I will be back next Monday with a fresh episode for you.
[25:35.920 --> 25:38.400]  We're getting close to 100 and I'm getting excited.
[25:38.400 --> 25:40.200]  Thanks for all your support.
[25:40.200 --> 25:41.700]  Don't forget to check out our sponsors,
[25:41.700 --> 25:42.920]  the Rocky Mountain Worm Company,

[25:44.360 --> 25:47.520]  and also check out naturesgreenremedies.com
[25:47.520 --> 25:49.700]  for all your seeds needs.
[25:49.700 --> 25:51.920]  If you guys are interested in sponsoring the podcast
[25:51.920 --> 25:54.200]  or if you've got a product that you'd like me to review,
[25:54.200 --> 25:55.600]  all you've got to do is send me an email.
[25:55.600 --> 25:57.540]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[25:57.540 --> 26:02.280]  I'll get you all of the information that you do need.
[26:02.280 --> 26:03.900]  Now that the show is over, you guys,
[26:03.900 --> 26:06.400]  if you're listening on iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[26:06.400 --> 26:09.560]  search for Grow From Your Heart, find the review section.
[26:09.560 --> 26:12.120]  Please give me a five-star rating and type in a comment
[26:12.120 --> 26:13.440]  and let me know what you think of the show
[26:13.440 --> 26:16.800]  and I will read your comments on a future episode.
[26:16.800 --> 26:18.320]  Stitcher sucks for comments right now.
[26:18.320 --> 26:20.000]  They keep changing the platform.
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.880]  So just leave a comment somewhere on there
[26:21.880 --> 26:23.360]  and I will find it hopefully.
[26:25.160 --> 26:27.000]  Yeah, the reason you want to leave a comment on iTunes
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.560]  and give me a five-star rating is because
[26:28.560 --> 26:31.120]  that moves me up in the ranks and people see the show.
[26:31.120 --> 26:33.200]  If we are noticed, then it puts us in the view
[26:33.200 --> 26:35.060]  of more folks, which will make more people
[26:35.060 --> 26:36.760]  grow better cannabis, which means you'll be able
[26:36.760 --> 26:38.640]  to smoke more better cannabis.
[26:38.640 --> 26:40.380]  I just said smoke more better cannabis.
[26:40.380 --> 26:42.020]  My grammar is getting awesome.
[26:42.960 --> 26:44.540]  Oh, we better just get to the end of this
[26:44.540 --> 26:46.420]  before my brain explodes.
[26:46.420 --> 26:47.640]  If you guys have something to say,
[26:47.640 --> 26:48.960]  find me on all the social media.
[26:48.960 --> 26:50.360]  I would appreciate it.
[26:50.360 --> 26:51.200]  I'm on Twitter.
[26:51.200 --> 26:53.220]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[26:53.220 --> 26:56.240]  I'm on Instagram under at I read genetics.
[26:56.240 --> 26:57.360]  I'm on Facebook.
[26:57.360 --> 26:58.980]  It's Grow From Your Heart.
[26:58.980 --> 27:00.640]  And also there's the email.
[27:00.640 --> 27:03.720]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:03.720 --> 27:05.400]  You guys, don't forget that the show is available
[27:05.400 --> 27:08.120]  on iTunes, Stitcher, and every single episode
[27:08.640 --> 27:12.400]  is archived on ireadgeneticscolorado.com.
[27:12.400 --> 27:14.240]  My buddy Tony added a donation button
[27:14.240 --> 27:16.360]  to the page a little while back.
[27:16.360 --> 27:18.080]  If you feel like the show is worth a couple of bucks
[27:18.080 --> 27:19.640]  and you wanna make a donation,
[27:19.640 --> 27:20.600]  you can go to my website.

[27:25.500 --> 27:27.840]  At the top right is a donation button.
[27:27.840 --> 27:30.400]  That goes directly to my PayPal account.
[27:30.400 --> 27:32.440]  I will never charge you guys for this podcast.
[27:32.440 --> 27:35.720]  This podcast is super free and it always will be.
[27:35.800 --> 27:38.360]  But if you feel like making a contribution,
[27:38.360 --> 27:40.800]  it would definitely be appreciated.
[27:40.800 --> 27:42.320]  I'm gonna go over here and make sure I'm telling you
[27:42.320 --> 27:44.400]  I'm in the right chatroom.
[27:44.400 --> 27:47.520]  This was recorded on Tripp's Pot Party.
[27:47.520 --> 27:49.480]  If you go to TinyChat, it's tinychat.com
[27:49.480 --> 27:51.160]  slash Tripp's Pot Party.
[27:51.160 --> 27:52.560]  Sometimes I'm on there.
[27:52.560 --> 27:56.140]  Sometimes I am on tinychat.com slash,
[27:56.140 --> 27:58.240]  I'm looking at it right now so that I can
[27:58.240 --> 27:59.920]  not tell you the wrong one.
[27:59.920 --> 28:00.760]  Come on, browser.
[28:00.760 --> 28:02.560]  I have so much shit going on in the computer right now
[28:02.560 --> 28:05.640]  that I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't wanna do this.
[28:06.460 --> 28:07.300]  It's lagging a little bit.
[28:07.300 --> 28:08.120]  We'll get there, y'all.
[28:08.120 --> 28:09.040]  We'll get there together.
[28:09.040 --> 28:09.880]  Here we go.
[28:09.880 --> 28:13.380]  The appropriate web address will be,
[28:14.700 --> 28:19.700]  it will be, there we go, tinychat.com slash BTVLiveMaine.
[28:20.200 --> 28:21.700]  So sometimes I'm in that chatroom.
[28:21.700 --> 28:23.840]  Sometimes I am in the other chatroom.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.520]  It's usually late at night when I am bored and can't sleep
[28:27.520 --> 28:28.520]  and I've got a lot on my mind
[28:28.520 --> 28:30.600]  and I'm trying to write a podcast and I need a dab break.
[28:30.600 --> 28:33.280]  I jump in here and chat with these folks.
[28:33.280 --> 28:34.640]  D's is shaking his head right now.
[28:34.640 --> 28:36.400]  He doesn't know I'm still watching him.
[28:36.400 --> 28:37.360]  But big shout out to D's.
[28:37.360 --> 28:38.840]  Big shout out to all my friends in the chatroom.
[28:38.840 --> 28:40.520]  You guys keep me sane late at night.
[28:40.520 --> 28:41.960]  Us growers have weird hours.
[28:41.960 --> 28:43.840]  We need friends online like you.
[28:43.840 --> 28:45.360]  Thanks to all you guys for listening to the show.
[28:45.360 --> 28:48.060]  I have been rambling on for a long time today.
[28:48.060 --> 28:49.960]  I'm going to put better shows together.
[28:49.960 --> 28:51.760]  You guys can tell that my head wound
[28:51.760 --> 28:53.380]  is definitely clearing up.
[28:53.380 --> 28:56.320]  And I also wanna give a big shout out to Alpha Brain.
[28:56.320 --> 28:59.480]  If you need a boost in your brain
[28:59.480 --> 29:02.920]  and you don't wanna do like caffeine or yerba mate
[29:02.920 --> 29:05.200]  cause it makes you too jittery or something,
[29:05.200 --> 29:09.120]  I definitely recommend Alpha Brain from onit.com.
[29:09.120 --> 29:10.720]  O-N-N-I-T.com.
[29:10.720 --> 29:12.160]  They don't pay me to say that shit, dude.
[29:12.160 --> 29:13.880]  I just sounded like I was doing a paid ad
[29:13.880 --> 29:15.160]  and they did not pay me to say that.
[29:15.160 --> 29:16.680]  It's shit that I use.
[29:16.680 --> 29:18.760]  It made my head feel a lot better after my head injury.
[29:18.760 --> 29:20.120]  It made the clouds go away.
[29:20.980 --> 29:22.840]  And it obviously made me a little rambly,
[29:22.840 --> 29:24.160]  but that's confidence.
[29:24.160 --> 29:26.480]  So yeah, I'm gonna wrap up the show.
[29:26.480 --> 29:27.800]  You guys, thanks for listening.
[29:27.800 --> 29:29.100]  I hope I did you a lot of good.
[29:29.100 --> 29:30.760]  I hope you're setting up a perpetual grow
[29:30.760 --> 29:32.720]  right now as we speak.
[29:33.480 --> 29:34.320]  Shout out to my ninja Spence.
[29:34.320 --> 29:35.840]  Until next time, you guys,
[29:35.840 --> 29:38.320]  take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
