[01:30.760 --> 01:35.880]  I was out doing some holiday shopping today and there was a a very intense vibe out there
[01:35.880 --> 01:40.600]  There's a lot of weird energy out there today. The past couple of weeks have been very intense
[01:40.600 --> 01:46.520]  I wanted to remind you to not let that shit get to you you guys if you're out there doing your holiday shopping if you're doing
[01:46.520 --> 01:49.120]  Whatever you need to do and life is getting to you shake it off
[01:49.240 --> 01:54.280]  Remember it's the holiday season. Everybody is stressed to the limit. It's been a weird year for everybody
[01:54.280 --> 01:57.440]  Don't let that little tiny bit of shit tip you at the end of the year
[01:57.440 --> 02:01.360]  We're gonna get a fresh new year here pretty soon. Hopefully we're gonna get some sort of a fucking break
[02:01.880 --> 02:03.520]  2020 is almost over
[02:03.520 --> 02:05.040]  2021 is gonna be a fresh start
[02:05.040 --> 02:09.560]  There's only a few more days left of this year then maybe we can get rid of this fucking curse or whatever happened to
[02:09.560 --> 02:13.400]  Us in 2020. My point is don't let all that bullshit get to you
[02:13.400 --> 02:15.400]  You guys keep your head up stay positive
[02:15.400 --> 02:18.720]  Give gifts from your heart love from your heart be compassionate
[02:18.720 --> 02:21.320]  Stay a good person in these times of stress and these weird times
[02:21.400 --> 02:24.400]  That is when we find out who the good people are. So don't be a dickhead
[02:24.400 --> 02:29.120]  Don't let this stress get to you. I understand it can be overwhelming. It could be a fucking lot right now
[02:29.120 --> 02:32.440]  People are weird people are rude. There are a lot of weird obstacles
[02:32.440 --> 02:37.120]  We've got to deal with all of our Christmas gifts are gonna be late because the mail is basically fucking stuck right now
[02:37.160 --> 02:41.640]  So don't let that get to you. It's gonna it's going to affect you emotionally spiritually
[02:42.160 --> 02:45.480]  Shake it off take a fat dab smoke a bowl give somebody a hug
[02:46.040 --> 02:50.000]  Hang out with me on a podcast get that shit out of your system. Let's have a good time
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.800]  All right, where are we going from there? I think it is time to give my friend easy
[02:54.480 --> 02:56.840]  057 a big thank you. Shout out
[02:57.200 --> 03:02.040]  I've been getting a lot of messages from people who have been following the show for a long time and they say hey, bro
[03:02.040 --> 03:08.200]  I really miss the Rasta flag in your podcast when I rebuilt the studio. I got a lot of brand new equipment
[03:08.200 --> 03:14.040]  We painted the walls. I didn't feel it was appropriate to hang the Rasta flag back on the wall. I love the flag
[03:14.040 --> 03:18.840]  I love the Rasta culture Rasta far I threw and through but the flag was a little bit
[03:19.440 --> 03:21.720]  Maybe a little bit juvenile for the podcast
[03:21.720 --> 03:25.240]  So I took it down and I did not rehang it it is hung somewhere else where I see it every day
[03:25.240 --> 03:27.740]  I get to see my Rasta flag, but it's not up for the show
[03:27.740 --> 03:31.280]  I felt like when I upgraded the show I wanted something a little bit classier
[03:31.280 --> 03:34.320]  I wasn't sure what was gonna go up on the wall and our friend easy
[03:34.800 --> 03:40.920]  057 took initiative and sent me a wonderful gift. I'm sure you can see behind me. We've got the I read genetics logo
[03:40.920 --> 03:44.140]  It says I read genetics premium seeds. It's got my red yellow and green colors
[03:44.180 --> 03:49.000]  That is the logo that comes on my seed packaging. I was blown away when I opened it
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.040]  It was better than I could even imagine and then when I hung it up and it fit perfectly behind me the lights hit it
[03:54.040 --> 03:57.560]  The whole room just went. Ah, so big shout out to our buddy easy
[03:58.080 --> 04:03.100]  057 for the beautiful I read genetics premium seed decoration that is hung up right behind me
[04:03.100 --> 04:05.320]  I'm gonna tip my head out of the way just for a moment
[04:05.320 --> 04:08.680]  So you can see it if you were listening to the podcast on an audio format
[04:08.680 --> 04:12.060]  This is one of the times I highly encourage you to check out the YouTube video
[04:12.180 --> 04:16.280]  Because I'm gonna move my stoned ass out of the way and let you look at this cool artwork for just a moment
[04:16.280 --> 04:18.500]  So check it out. Shout out to easy. Oh five seven
[04:20.800 --> 04:24.140]  Look how smooth that is you guys it's got the I read genetics up top
[04:24.140 --> 04:27.240]  It says premium seeds down here on the bottom. It's got the cross in the middle
[04:27.240 --> 04:32.900]  It's got my colors on it the pattern in the background stands out real bold. I think it looks great. Thank you
[04:32.900 --> 04:36.340]  Big thanks to the artist who created the logo and then big thanks to easy
[04:36.900 --> 04:43.140]  057 for printing it and having it sent to me. It's on canvas. It's really professional. It's really high quality
[04:43.140 --> 04:49.340]  I was blown the fuck away. That's the first Christmas gift. I've received this year. So thank you brother. I do appreciate it
[04:49.340 --> 04:51.340]  Where are we gonna go from there?
[04:51.380 --> 04:56.620]  New camera settings. I don't know if you notice but I notice it. I am recording with a brand new camera setting
[04:56.620 --> 05:01.980]  I'm still learning this Sony a 64 cam if you love or hate this camera setting. Let me know
[05:01.980 --> 05:06.780]  I don't know what's going to look like until I start doing color correcting what I see on my little screen
[05:06.780 --> 05:09.180]  There is always different compared to what I see on my big screen
[05:09.180 --> 05:11.720]  There will be some color correcting some editing to be done
[05:11.980 --> 05:15.980]  The bottom line is I'm using a new setting if you hate it. Let me know if you love it
[05:15.980 --> 05:17.780]  Let me know I may take your feedback
[05:17.780 --> 05:20.460]  I may just keep doing my own thing, but I'd like to know what you think
[05:20.460 --> 05:23.660]  I'd like to know if you liked it before now or just give me some feedback
[05:23.660 --> 05:28.700]  I'm still learning this equipment your input means a lot to me. You're the one watching so let me know what you think
[05:29.020 --> 05:30.300]  Where are we going from there?
[05:30.300 --> 05:34.860]  The next important thing to talk about is cannabis if you're following me on cannabis
[05:34.860 --> 05:40.180]  You know that cannabis has recently changed the way they do their direct messaging until yesterday
[05:40.180 --> 05:43.740]  You were able to direct message anybody else on the cannabis app
[05:43.740 --> 05:48.420]  I let me back up cannabis is a free application available for your Android or Apple device
[05:48.540 --> 05:51.260]  It's a cannabis friendly social media application
[05:51.260 --> 05:56.100]  You can't buy sell or trade cannabis there, but you can post your cannabis related content
[05:56.100 --> 05:57.380]  You can post your dab videos
[05:57.380 --> 06:04.580]  You can post your garden pictures post all kinds of cannabis related content and unlike many of the other popular social media platforms
[06:04.580 --> 06:05.980]  You will not be scrutinized
[06:05.980 --> 06:06.480]  however
[06:06.480 --> 06:09.340]  If you do go post in a bunch of booty pics and a bunch of porn and stuff
[06:09.340 --> 06:13.460]  They will politely ask you to stop doing that because that is not what the app is for
[06:14.060 --> 06:16.380]  Some people have taken advantage of the app
[06:16.380 --> 06:23.020]  They have found some loopholes and they begin direct messaging people and asking for money and sending porn and a bunch of spam
[06:23.020 --> 06:28.660]  So cannabis was forced to minimize the direct messaging interactions
[06:28.660 --> 06:32.540]  What they have done is now you can only message somebody if you are mutually
[06:33.220 --> 06:39.380]  Mutually following each other which means I have to follow you and you have to follow me if we want to direct message each other. I
[06:40.940 --> 06:46.860]  No offense to anybody's account. I don't want to follow all 30,000 of the people on cannabis that makes my feed a mess
[06:47.220 --> 06:52.020]  We are selective about who we follow because we want to see certain pictures. That's what social media is for
[06:52.020 --> 06:58.220]  I want to see certain things. It's not that I don't want to see your pics. It's just I'm more focused on certain people's content
[06:58.220 --> 07:02.060]  It's curated content for what I like. I don't want to be required to follow
[07:02.060 --> 07:07.600]  I think there are about 30 to 40 thousand users on cannabis. I'm not gonna follow 40,000 people
[07:07.600 --> 07:12.040]  I was following about 60 because I enjoy those accounts. It's a new app. They're still building accounts
[07:12.060 --> 07:17.020]  My point is I cannot direct message with you unless we are mutually following each other
[07:17.020 --> 07:24.820]  So it is drastically and greatly limited the amount of interactions I can have on cannabis. I'm not ignoring you. I'm not blocking you
[07:24.820 --> 07:30.280]  I'm not dodging you that is a feature that had to be turned on on cannabis to protect the cannabis community
[07:30.280 --> 07:34.980]  I will admit I was upset. I was frustrated at first. I felt like I was being cock-blocked
[07:34.980 --> 07:39.620]  I felt like a lot of my interactions were going to be limited. I felt like I kind of abandoned my community
[07:39.620 --> 07:42.780]  I've got an open-door policy if you send me a message on cannabis
[07:42.780 --> 07:46.640]  It may take me a couple of days, but I will reply to that message up until now now
[07:46.640 --> 07:51.280]  I won't even get your message, but I feel like I blocked off a large member of my community
[07:51.280 --> 07:55.160]  I was on cannabis from the beginning a lot of people really appreciated the interactions
[07:55.160 --> 08:00.520]  We were having there and now those interactions are not possible. It was necessary at first
[08:00.520 --> 08:06.920]  I was upset now. I understand it was necessary. Our community was at risk people were getting spammed people were getting scammed
[08:07.280 --> 08:13.520]  There was content happening that we did not support or promote or condone on cannabis. So corrections needed to be made
[08:13.520 --> 08:15.120]  This is only temporary
[08:15.120 --> 08:19.160]  The development team is working on new things to get us around this problem
[08:19.160 --> 08:24.780]  But until then we're going to have to minimize the way we message each other. This may not affect a lot of users
[08:24.780 --> 08:28.280]  I have a larger account than many folks on there
[08:28.280 --> 08:30.040]  So my account was affected more by this
[08:30.040 --> 08:35.580]  But it will affect everybody who was relying on me for a grow question if we were having a conversation or something
[08:35.580 --> 08:39.040]  We can't communicate now. So that is limited us. I do apologize
[08:39.040 --> 08:41.800]  There is a way around this until this is fixed
[08:41.800 --> 08:45.080]  If you've got an urgent grow question that you were going to ask me on cannabis
[08:45.080 --> 08:46.920]  All you have to do is send me an email
[08:46.920 --> 08:52.300]  My email address of course is grow from your heart at hotmail.com that will get to me
[08:52.600 --> 08:59.040]  Also, I am getting a ton of emails from the help tab on the website. I am NOT ignoring you
[08:59.040 --> 09:01.160]  It's the Christmas season. It's the holiday season
[09:01.160 --> 09:07.480]  I'm simply overwhelmed by all of those messages and Christmas shopping and life and family stuff
[09:07.480 --> 09:11.520]  I'm not ignoring anybody. I love all of you like my own children like my own pets
[09:11.520 --> 09:15.280]  I will answer all of those messages. Just be patient with me, please
[09:15.280 --> 09:17.820]  There are thousands of you and there's one of me
[09:17.820 --> 09:19.760]  I'm doing my best to get to all of you
[09:19.760 --> 09:23.560]  You all mean the world to me without each and every one of you this wouldn't be the success
[09:23.560 --> 09:27.660]  It is I wouldn't be successful. My show wouldn't be successful. My brand wouldn't be crushing it
[09:27.660 --> 09:31.600]  So I do appreciate love and respect all of you, but you've got to be patient with me, please
[09:31.600 --> 09:35.460]  I will get to you. So if you can't message me on cannabis
[09:35.780 --> 09:40.240]  Please do not abandon cannabis people are saying I'm ditching the service because of this don't do that
[09:40.240 --> 09:46.320]  This is a temporary problem that will have a real solution and things will be much better. Once that solution comes
[09:46.320 --> 09:50.460]  I know that cannabis is working on quite a few updates that are coming in the future
[09:50.460 --> 09:57.040]  The development team take some time to get stuff going it costs money to do things all of this stuff and kovat is slowing everything
[09:57.040 --> 10:03.380]  Down so once they get the messaging fixed also another feature that is coming is the live chat
[10:03.380 --> 10:07.900]  I can do a live video on cannabis and I can go talk and I can hang out but you guys cannot chat and interact
[10:07.900 --> 10:10.260]  With me in the future that will be interactive
[10:10.260 --> 10:14.440]  I'll be able to see the comments you're leaving and I can reply to them just like that other app that I use on Mondays
[10:14.480 --> 10:18.960]  So, please don't abandon cannabis. I know it's frustrating to be limited
[10:18.960 --> 10:23.980]  I know there are some weird things happening. Don't get frustrated and ditch us now now is when we need you
[10:23.980 --> 10:29.500]  Please stick around. So just simply email me at grow from your heart at hotmail.com. I will get back to you
[10:29.500 --> 10:31.500]  It's going to take me a moment because I've got
[10:31.580 --> 10:36.660]  Thousands of messages in my inbox. I will answer every single one of them individual. I don't have a secretary
[10:36.660 --> 10:41.060]  I don't have an intern. I don't have a social media person. It is me
[10:41.060 --> 10:46.100]  I read genetics is me the grow from your heart podcast is me and you guys so we've got to work together
[10:46.100 --> 10:51.560]  It's all us together. So let's work together. Be patient with me guys. I do love you and I'm going to get to your messages
[10:52.820 --> 10:56.940]  If you feel like the message was super urgent message me again get it to the top of the list
[10:57.900 --> 11:04.140]  Please don't just keep doing that though. If your garden is in fucking dire trouble message me again. We'll get you going also
[11:04.820 --> 11:05.900]  I
[11:05.900 --> 11:09.660]  Want to send a big thank you to just a far eye on the last episode
[11:09.660 --> 11:13.100]  I said that I wanted a little logo this little logo that is right here
[11:13.100 --> 11:15.600]  I don't know where it is yet because it's not in the video yet, obviously, right?
[11:15.600 --> 11:18.500]  It'll be there after editing but the little logo that's right about here
[11:18.500 --> 11:22.060]  That looks super slick on the screen right now that came from our friend just a far eye
[11:22.300 --> 11:25.100]  Thank you for the the very quick submission
[11:25.100 --> 11:30.020]  I think I pressed go on that episode and as soon as it launched to iTunes and YouTube just afar
[11:30.020 --> 11:33.900]  I was like, oh you wanted a logo. Here you go, bro. So big shout out, bro. I do appreciate you
[11:33.900 --> 11:38.840]  You do amazing work. I got a lot of submissions. I'm going to cycle through all of them
[11:39.420 --> 11:42.640]  Justify I was right on top and I loved it. So his is going up today
[11:42.640 --> 11:48.140]  I will cycle through all of the submissions I got I'll put a bunch of different logos up on the screen over time
[11:48.140 --> 11:51.860]  We'll see which one sticks the best and we will continue to use that one for the long term
[11:51.900 --> 11:53.900]  But I'm going to audition them slowly
[11:54.260 --> 11:59.080]  Thank you to everybody who sent me cool little GF y HTV logos
[11:59.080 --> 12:05.720]  Some people sent multiple options some people did edits and corrections super cool. Thank you. I appreciate it this time
[12:05.720 --> 12:11.320]  We're gonna use jaw stuff our eyes little logo right here on the screen. Thank you, bro. That means a lot to me
[12:11.620 --> 12:18.700]  All right. Um, where are we gonna go from there? I wrote mid topic. This isn't the main topic. This is the pre main topic
[12:19.300 --> 12:23.380]  Recently somebody was saying that if cannabis was going to minimize messaging
[12:23.380 --> 12:28.220]  Maybe we should do discord and then I opened up my message box and I got this message
[12:28.220 --> 12:32.180]  We're just gonna jump right into it. It goes. Oh, I got the wrong one on top of the paper here
[12:32.180 --> 12:36.140]  Let me fix that. It's alright. I'm only human. This one goes like this. It says hey Jeff
[12:36.140 --> 12:40.000]  I am a patreon contributor of the 710 Club and I'm listening to episode
[12:41.020 --> 12:47.400]  586 I am a disabled veteran with PTSD from deployments in the army. Thank you for your service my friend
[12:47.400 --> 12:53.440]  It says I am the opposite of most of your veteran emails. I am NOT looking for someone to help me out rather
[12:53.440 --> 12:59.520]  I am looking to help out other veterans in your group. This is in reference to I asked
[12:59.820 --> 13:04.980]  so a while back we asked to get help for a grow light for a veteran in need and
[13:05.880 --> 13:09.380]  Our friends at black sale market shout out to Keith from black sale market
[13:09.380 --> 13:16.540]  Keith was able to donate a light to a disabled veteran in need and that veteran got seeds and a light and a lot of
[13:16.540 --> 13:21.480]  Useful advice and they are now growing with a Canon LED light. Thanks to a very
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.200]  Generous contribution from our friend at black sale market. So this veteran wants to kind of continue that trend
[13:28.760 --> 13:35.100]  It says growing this plant the past few years has saved my life and helped me to stop drinking non-stop
[13:35.100 --> 13:40.080]  I understand that to be quite honest with you before I got my medical marijuana card
[13:40.080 --> 13:43.940]  I was a sloppy drunk when I got my medical marijuana card
[13:43.940 --> 13:48.800]  I told myself if I get this card and I can go to the weed store every day and buy as much cannabis as I
[13:48.800 --> 13:52.660]  Want there's no reason to drink and at that point I quit drinking
[13:52.820 --> 13:59.980]  So in a similar sense cannabis saved my life because if I would have kept drinking I would be dead or in jail or would
[13:59.980 --> 14:04.160]  Have hurt somebody I probably would have gotten a DUI by now. It would have gotten in a fight
[14:04.160 --> 14:06.380]  I would have done something stupid with as much as I drank
[14:06.380 --> 14:12.300]  I'm six foot five and nearly 200 pounds me and whiskey were good friends that that shit did not work out very well toward the
[14:12.300 --> 14:15.080]  End of the night. So yeah, I do agree with you that
[14:15.780 --> 14:21.420]  Quitting alcohol and switching over to cannabis full-time probably saved both of our lives. So it's good to hear that brother
[14:21.420 --> 14:24.740]  I'm glad you were alcohol free and I'm glad you're on team cannabis with us
[14:24.740 --> 14:30.120]  It says I wonder if the DGC could help get a discord group started for your podcast, too
[14:30.120 --> 14:33.620]  That's a good platform for a lot of us to chat and get help from each other
[14:33.620 --> 14:38.660]  I'm a successful home grower in prohibition land looking forward to possibly linking up with other
[14:39.060 --> 14:44.260]  Veteran growers stay lifted from our friend pro brewer home grower
[14:44.260 --> 14:48.580]  So you might be making some beer which is still cool if you're making some beers and consuming it responsibly
[14:48.580 --> 14:49.260]  That's just fine
[14:49.260 --> 14:53.620]  Do your thing there as long as you're not drinking to fucking blackout and to cause problems and get away from problems
[14:53.700 --> 15:00.220]  Then you're cool, but I really enjoy this message. I love that a veteran is reaching out to help other veterans
[15:00.220 --> 15:01.580]  I think that that is really cool
[15:01.580 --> 15:05.800]  This is where the grow from your heart podcast and the ivory army come into play
[15:06.240 --> 15:13.520]  One of our good friends was kind enough to create us a irie genetics grow from your heart irie army
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.640]  Discord page. I don't know what the correct terminology is for discord. I am learning discord
[15:18.640 --> 15:20.600]  I spent a couple hours on there today
[15:20.600 --> 15:22.360]  There's a lot going on on that app
[15:22.360 --> 15:28.400]  But there are also a lot of cool people on that app the irie genetics grow from your heart group is growing quite rapidly
[15:28.800 --> 15:33.840]  Big shout out to our friend gray beard gray beard took the initiative to create the irie genetics
[15:33.840 --> 15:39.000]  Irie army grow from your heart discord page channel, whatever it is. It was created by gray beard
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.080]  He did it all then sent me a message and said hey, I did this
[15:42.080 --> 15:44.680]  I hope you're cool with that join us and I was like, bro. I asked for that
[15:44.680 --> 15:46.640]  So, thank you big salute to gray beard
[15:46.640 --> 15:52.520]  That does mean a lot to me also shout out to lemur priest the captain and commander of the irie army for being the main
[15:52.520 --> 15:54.520]  moderator in the discord group
[15:54.880 --> 15:58.320]  So where I am headed with this is I am now part of a discord group
[15:58.320 --> 16:01.480]  There's an irie genetics irie army grow from your heart discord group
[16:01.480 --> 16:07.160]  That does exist as soon as I read this message. I sent a little message to lemur priest and it said hey, bro
[16:07.160 --> 16:11.640]  We need to get a group in the discord group that helps get gear to veterans
[16:11.680 --> 16:16.120]  So now by the time you hear this message on discord, this will be a thing
[16:16.520 --> 16:23.100]  Join us on discord make an account find the irie genetics. Irie army grow from your heart group and jump in
[16:23.100 --> 16:28.560]  I am still learning the app. I know that as you scroll you will see a spot that says grow gear for vets
[16:28.720 --> 16:34.720]  Click on that that'll take you to the feed where you can talk to people who are in need or have gear to donate to
[16:34.720 --> 16:41.960]  Veterans I also do intend to create a Facebook group for the same purpose. It doesn't have a name yet. I'm in talks
[16:41.960 --> 16:44.160]  I'm making sure I'm going to do this legally
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.240]  I'm talking to my accountant and a paralegal making sure that I don't get myself in any trouble
[16:48.840 --> 16:52.240]  Just by starting the group if something goes wrong, it could land on me
[16:52.240 --> 16:54.600]  So I'm going to find my legal boundaries there
[16:54.600 --> 16:57.920]  Then I will start the Facebook group to help get veterans gear
[16:57.920 --> 17:04.440]  It will be something about the grow from your heart gear for vets something like that will be in the Facebook group name
[17:04.440 --> 17:05.920]  I will make that
[17:05.920 --> 17:08.520]  By the time this episode comes out that will be completed
[17:08.520 --> 17:10.800]  I have a phone call tomorrow that will let me know what I need to do
[17:10.960 --> 17:16.820]  So big shout out to gray beard for starting the discord shout out to lemur priest
[17:17.040 --> 17:22.800]  For kind of moderating that big shout out to everybody who already joined the discord when I was on there today
[17:22.800 --> 17:26.480]  There was a bunch of people and then big super shout out to our friend pro brewer
[17:26.600 --> 17:32.240]  Home grower for being a veteran and wanting to reach out and help other vets. That is really super cool
[17:32.240 --> 17:36.120]  So you guys join the discord group find the Facebook group that I will make
[17:36.280 --> 17:40.840]  I've got to find the legal guidelines and see how much trouble I can and cannot get in by doing this
[17:40.840 --> 17:46.760]  But I will make the group it will happen and we will get some gear into the hands of veterans in need these people
[17:46.800 --> 17:50.180]  Served our country like I've said before I don't agree with war
[17:50.180 --> 17:52.420]  I don't think shooting people and bombing people is cool
[17:52.620 --> 17:54.260]  But if somebody's got to do it
[17:54.260 --> 17:58.040]  I have huge respect for the people that put their lives on the line
[17:58.040 --> 18:01.780]  They sign up to go do that because if you start throwing grenades at me and shooting at me
[18:01.780 --> 18:07.980]  I'm running that way these gentlemen and ladies. They're running that way into the fucking fire. That is fucking brave
[18:07.980 --> 18:12.220]  That is honorable that is commendable. They've done a lot of work. Let's get them some gear
[18:12.220 --> 18:17.940]  Let's get them growing so they can treat their anxiety depression PTSD and not drink themselves into a stupor
[18:18.220 --> 18:23.580]  Not dole themselves out with a bunch of pills. Let's help the people who keep us free free freedom
[18:23.820 --> 18:28.340]  All right. Now let's move into did I cover all of that? Oh, I'm going to need volunteers
[18:28.340 --> 18:33.140]  I'm going to need volunteers for this Facebook group. Like I've said before I'm simply overloaded
[18:33.300 --> 18:39.340]  I'm trying to interact with all of the messages. I try to be responsible for a lot of things. I am in constant go mode
[18:39.340 --> 18:44.740]  I'm not complaining. I love it. That's idle hands or the devil's playground, especially me when I get bored
[18:44.740 --> 18:48.140]  I'm good at fucking up. So I try to stay busy keep myself out of trouble
[18:48.140 --> 18:54.020]  However, I will need volunteers to help me run this Facebook group. It's going to be kind of an autonomous thing
[18:54.020 --> 18:56.160]  Well, once I create it introduce a few people
[18:56.160 --> 19:01.380]  I want to be able to step back and let the group do its thing people give gear people receive gear
[19:01.380 --> 19:04.540]  So I may need volunteers to help moderate help run that
[19:04.540 --> 19:07.860]  Let me know if you're interested send me an email at grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[19:08.100 --> 19:10.780]  Or join the group and let me know that you are interested
[19:11.460 --> 19:16.900]  We may need help verifying veterans that may be one thing that we need to do we'll need help connecting veterans
[19:16.900 --> 19:22.540]  We'll need people with gear if you've got gear that you want to give away or donate or if you're a company that is willing
[19:22.540 --> 19:25.100]  To donate equipment we could use lighting
[19:25.100 --> 19:30.340]  Of course lights are usually the most expensive things to get to growers then we can use nutrients we can use soil
[19:30.340 --> 19:33.420]  We can use everything that you can donate for a grow
[19:33.420 --> 19:38.820]  I'm sure that there is somebody out there who needs that for their setup. So help us out you guys
[19:38.820 --> 19:45.540]  Please help us out on the discord and on the grow from your heart gear for vets Facebook group
[19:45.540 --> 19:49.700]  I think that is what I've got for that part big shout out to Jesse also Jesse
[19:50.100 --> 19:55.240]  Our friend Jesse has been on the show before actually just set up another veteran with another light
[19:55.240 --> 20:02.060]  So we've already got two lights in two veterans gardens and we haven't even started the grow from your heart gear for vets program yet
[20:02.060 --> 20:05.380]  So thank you guys for all of that support. Let's move forward to the next message
[20:05.380 --> 20:09.820]  Once again big shout out to my veteran friend pro brewer home grower
[20:09.820 --> 20:15.200]  I do appreciate the support and thank you for trying to help out your fellow vets and thank you once again for your service
[20:15.620 --> 20:19.740]  Let's move to a next message. This one comes from another person who is a veteran
[20:19.740 --> 20:24.020]  I didn't do that on purpose, but I've seen photos of this young man in his uniform
[20:25.100 --> 20:30.620]  This one just comes from Tonto and it goes just like this. It says hey, my name is and I'm not gonna read your real name
[20:30.620 --> 20:32.100]  brother
[20:32.100 --> 20:35.620]  Let's see. My name is Tonto from Alberta, Alberta, Canada
[20:35.740 --> 20:40.940]  Thanks to all of the hard work and audio material you have put out there at zero cost to everyone
[20:40.940 --> 20:47.500]  Which has given me the confidence and knowledge to switch from legal companies in Canada to a home medical
[20:48.140 --> 20:51.620]  Cultivation there's a lot in that first sentence there shout out to our friend Tonto
[20:51.780 --> 20:55.120]  He gets a lot of shout outs on the show great person beautiful family
[20:55.500 --> 21:00.080]  He said thanks for all of the hard work and audio material and video material Tonto
[21:00.080 --> 21:06.040]  Please check out the video check out YouTube subscribe to the YouTube channel that helps me out a lot, but at zero cost
[21:06.040 --> 21:12.400]  Yes, I put this house absolutely free. I do ask for patreon contributions, but if you're not able to contribute I don't block you
[21:12.400 --> 21:13.240]  I don't shy you away
[21:13.240 --> 21:18.880]  I still encourage you to listen and better your grow better yourself the people that pay for the patreon contributions
[21:18.880 --> 21:23.360]  They are covering you also, so thank you to them. Let me keep going
[21:23.360 --> 21:28.920]  It says I recently received my grow license from Health Canada and I can legally grow 25 plants
[21:29.320 --> 21:35.520]  Bro, that is nice here in Colorado. We get six recreational plants, and if you're a medical marijuana patient you get six more
[21:35.520 --> 21:39.440]  So we were allowed 12 plants per household. There's no tricks you can do to get more
[21:39.440 --> 21:43.200]  We used to be able to play some tricks and run some numbers and do some bangs and get some more
[21:43.200 --> 21:47.440]  They shut us down on all that so 25 is a good number, bro. That would be awesome
[21:47.440 --> 21:53.160]  It says no words or amount of money can show my gratitude for sharing so much knowledge with the community
[21:53.560 --> 21:58.440]  Bro this right here is what does it this interaction is what pays me back you saying?
[21:58.440 --> 21:58.960]  Thank you
[21:58.960 --> 22:04.520]  You sending me pictures to grow and of the family and how happy you are with the success you're having that stuff pays me back
[22:04.520 --> 22:09.560]  So don't worry too much about trying to pay me and you do contribute to patreon so you are paying me
[22:09.560 --> 22:13.000]  But still you don't owe me anything. This is a beautiful relationship
[22:13.280 --> 22:18.320]  It says your podcast is my number one way to consume and absorb information
[22:18.320 --> 22:20.320]  So from the bottom of my bottom of my heart
[22:20.520 --> 22:25.240]  Thank you for providing a foundation of knowledge for me to build on
[22:25.560 --> 22:32.520]  Did those statements that people send me like that that is currency to me you were you're knocking off all the fucking?
[22:32.680 --> 22:34.960]  Holiday stress that I had all the shopping bullshit
[22:34.960 --> 22:40.520]  I had to deal with all the fucking standing in line all the rushing around all the you wash that all away
[22:40.600 --> 22:46.220]  With these types of compliments, so thank you that stuff is currency that is payment that recharges my soul
[22:46.220 --> 22:48.220]  That's nutrients. So thank you
[22:48.980 --> 22:50.140]  I'm gonna keep going
[22:50.140 --> 22:55.900]  It says I hope that you and yours are doing well and safe in this time of uncertainty in our world history
[22:55.900 --> 22:59.820]  It is so weird right now, bro. I am well, my daughter's well, my mom as well
[22:59.820 --> 23:03.220]  I think everybody directly around us is pretty good. I hope you're well, too
[23:03.220 --> 23:05.380]  I think we're doing all right, but thank you
[23:05.380 --> 23:10.140]  It says I know a lot of people I have been and will continue to be hit very hard by Kovat. Yes
[23:10.780 --> 23:12.780]  my town is
[23:13.020 --> 23:17.820]  Infected half the people around here. I just said that I'm well my mom as well and my daughter as well
[23:17.820 --> 23:24.380]  But we all know five or six or ten people who all have Kovat and we all know somebody who has passed from Kovat at
[23:24.380 --> 23:26.940]  This point so yes, it is getting hit very hard
[23:26.940 --> 23:31.940]  It says I am very fortunate to be in my current situation, which has left me better off than most
[23:32.500 --> 23:37.660]  Isn't it great when people realize that they are better off than most and it's such a good feeling to see you're like man
[23:37.660 --> 23:41.540]  I'm doing pretty good for myself and the to acknowledge that you're doing better off than most
[23:41.820 --> 23:45.660]  That's a compassionate thing. I'm rambling today, but we're gonna stay focused
[23:46.220 --> 23:53.060]  It says but to show my support and thanks I have increased my patreon subscription. Although small it still helps. I am sure
[23:53.740 --> 23:58.580]  Tonto you're a family man and just the fact that you are able to contribute at all and you
[23:59.060 --> 24:00.860]  Volunteered to do so that means a lot to me
[24:00.860 --> 24:07.340]  So don't ever feel like your contribution is little nobody out there feel like your contribution is little some people give a dollar some people
[24:07.340 --> 24:09.180]  give a hundred dollars I
[24:09.180 --> 24:12.860]  Love the people that give me a dollar as much as the people who give me
[24:13.580 --> 24:19.260]  $100 some of those people that give me a dollar may have two dollars and they gave me one of them some of those people
[24:19.260 --> 24:22.740]  That have a hundred dollars may have a hundred and one and they gave me a hundred of them
[24:22.740 --> 24:25.900]  That means a lot to me just one dollar and a hundred dollars
[24:25.900 --> 24:30.540]  I know it probably feels weird to the people who gave me a hundred to say that you mean as much to me if you
[24:30.540 --> 24:34.600]  Gave me one or if you gave me a hundred I appreciate love and respect you just the same
[24:34.600 --> 24:39.140]  But I do see the different contributions. I don't try to judge you for it. I appreciate it all
[24:39.500 --> 24:44.820]  That just sounds weird because now the people that gave me more feel like I don't respect them more but don't worry
[24:44.820 --> 24:49.620]  I think they get it. I'm gonna try to talk myself out of this circle. Let's jump back into the email
[24:49.620 --> 24:52.500]  That's a good way to do it. Haha. It says I do have a couple of questions
[24:52.620 --> 24:55.020]  I was hoping you can answer these for me
[24:55.020 --> 24:58.220]  I have searched the internet for answers, but the information wasn't available
[24:58.220 --> 24:58.880]  And yes
[24:58.880 --> 25:00.100]  when you do find the information
[25:00.100 --> 25:01.660]  You're gonna find one article that
[25:01.660 --> 25:07.020]  Contradicts the article that you thought was working and then another article that will really spin your mind and give you different ideas
[25:07.020 --> 25:09.860]  So the internet can be really challenging to find new information
[25:09.900 --> 25:12.700]  I'm glad you reached out to me because I can give you real advice
[25:12.820 --> 25:16.460]  It says I didn't trust the internet and there was no real source for the information
[25:16.460 --> 25:20.780]  You have mentioned in your episodes that you remove any large fan leaves with a purple stem
[25:20.780 --> 25:25.960]  I'm curious as to why because that is the first time I heard it and I've been curious since I heard it
[25:25.960 --> 25:30.420]  I've been doing a bit more defoliation every grow as I get more confident
[25:30.700 --> 25:31.200]  Okay
[25:31.200 --> 25:33.320]  So the question is in a recent episode
[25:33.320 --> 25:40.600]  I've said to when you were defoliating to defoliate any leaf with a purple stem and our friend Tonto is asking why I take
[25:40.600 --> 25:42.600]  off the leaves with the purple stems
[25:43.320 --> 25:50.440]  The main basic reason that I say remove the leaves with the purple stems is that is a very trainable task
[25:50.440 --> 25:57.140]  If I say, alright guys, we're going to our gals guys and gals grow team. We're going to defoliate this whole room today
[25:57.140 --> 26:03.260]  I want you to go in and take off every leaf with a purple petiole. That is really easy to follow
[26:03.260 --> 26:05.940]  That's a really easy guideline a really easy instruction
[26:05.940 --> 26:09.400]  You can visually see purple petiole break it off not purple
[26:09.400 --> 26:16.060]  Keep moving purple break it off and it makes it real easy real trainable for anybody to understand that now
[26:16.060 --> 26:19.660]  Why do I want those leaves gone is the next part of this question?
[26:20.220 --> 26:24.220]  Usually if the leaf has developed a purple petiole or petiole
[26:24.220 --> 26:30.820]  However, you want to pronounce it that is probably a big enough leaf that it is blocking something beneath it and that bud site below
[26:30.940 --> 26:33.700]  Should be getting the light that this big leaf is blocking
[26:33.700 --> 26:36.420]  So if you got a big leaf here, you got a bud development here
[26:36.420 --> 26:41.540]  This petiole is probably purple go ahead and pull that leaf off that light is now going to hit this bud
[26:41.540 --> 26:47.100]  This buds gonna get those the PPFD that photon energy and that bud will grow bigger and fatter
[26:47.220 --> 26:51.820]  So that is why I remove those big leaves with the purple petioles. Those are older leaves
[26:52.380 --> 26:54.380]  They are thicker they're probably
[26:55.140 --> 26:59.740]  If you're going to get a deficiency or a problem, those are the leaves that it's going to show up on first
[27:00.100 --> 27:02.860]  Those are where the spider mites the powdery mildew go first
[27:02.860 --> 27:06.580]  If we get rid of those leaves that are those are less hotels for bugs
[27:06.740 --> 27:11.860]  Less opportunities for powdery mildew and those are the oldest and biggest leaves that are blocking the light
[27:11.860 --> 27:18.420]  So there are several reasons why I'm taking those out of there mainly to stop blocking the light and also it will help with
[27:18.620 --> 27:24.340]  Humidity problems in a giant grow we get a lot of respiration and transpiration in a giant grow without that many leaves
[27:24.340 --> 27:26.540]  You're not releasing that much moisture into the air
[27:26.540 --> 27:30.380]  It will help you out and we're also mitigating bug problems at the same time
[27:30.580 --> 27:32.740]  so the reason I say purple petioles is
[27:32.900 --> 27:39.900]  Because those are the bigger leaves and those are the older leaves and those are most likely the leaves blocking my developing bud sites
[27:39.900 --> 27:44.140]  I hope I made that one clear for you because there are more parts to this question
[27:44.220 --> 27:48.500]  It says could you explain or point to me a podcast about reusing soil?
[27:48.580 --> 27:51.140]  I'd like to be more eco-friendly and save a bit
[27:51.140 --> 27:56.100]  I would like to reuse my soil if there are not too many cons to doing so
[27:56.580 --> 28:00.900]  Okay, recycling and reusing soil can be very cost-effective
[28:00.900 --> 28:06.740]  It can also be very dangerous if you had any problems in your grow if you saw one bug
[28:06.740 --> 28:09.260]  I don't care if it was a thrip a spider mite or a fungus net
[28:09.260 --> 28:12.580]  I would reconsider recycling the soil and not do that
[28:12.580 --> 28:16.980]  If you did not have any problems in your grow through the entire grow
[28:17.140 --> 28:21.140]  Then you can consider recycling the soil in part of your message
[28:21.140 --> 28:24.740]  You do tell me that you were using HP Pro mix with added perlite
[28:24.980 --> 28:29.980]  One of the first things that comes to mind is if you do recycle that soil, it's going to be dead
[28:29.980 --> 28:35.380]  There's nothing in there. It is basically just a little bag of dirt to hold your roots
[28:35.380 --> 28:40.660]  There's no living stuff in there because at the end of your last cycle you should have flushed heavily
[28:40.660 --> 28:45.580]  You removed all of the bottled nutrients all the built-up salts all the stuff that was in that soil
[28:45.580 --> 28:49.700]  You have washed it out. You've basically got a bag of dirt at this point
[28:49.700 --> 28:54.340]  There's nothing living in there. If you're using the pro mix you've washed all that stuff out
[28:54.340 --> 29:00.660]  So the very first thing I would recommend is you need to reactivate that soil with some microbes
[29:00.660 --> 29:04.500]  I would put probably some recharge in there big shout out to Scotty real
[29:04.500 --> 29:07.340]  I would put some recharge in that soil. I would honestly
[29:08.500 --> 29:13.860]  Rinse out that soil. So let me back up get your harvest your plants. You've got your soil
[29:13.860 --> 29:17.860]  You got your three or five gallon pot. Do you tell me what size pots you use? Um
[29:19.860 --> 29:24.260]  Doesn't look like it you've got your pots of soil dump those pots of soil into a big container
[29:24.940 --> 29:26.900]  Remove the big root balls
[29:26.900 --> 29:31.340]  If you can get as much of the big stuff out of there as you can get a claw type thing
[29:31.340 --> 29:32.060]  And just break it up
[29:32.060 --> 29:36.660]  I forget what the that claw looking thing use two of those with both hands and just get in there break all that soil up
[29:36.660 --> 29:38.860]  The best you can pull out all the big root balls
[29:39.140 --> 29:41.340]  Then when you re-pop the pots
[29:41.340 --> 29:48.260]  I would water them before you even put plants in there mix up a batch of water and put the recommended amount of recharge in
[29:48.260 --> 29:53.900]  That water and water that through your plants. Also, maybe put some enzymes in that same mix
[29:53.900 --> 29:56.500]  What we are doing now is we are reactivating that water
[29:56.580 --> 30:03.340]  We're gonna get some microbial life into that soil if you put some enzymes in there those enzymes will help break down all the old
[30:03.340 --> 30:06.020]  Dead decaying shit that is left behind from your old plants
[30:06.020 --> 30:10.420]  It will actually turn that stuff into usable food for your new plants that go in there
[30:10.460 --> 30:15.460]  So I would cut down the plants pull out the root balls break up the dirt put it into a container
[30:15.540 --> 30:17.540]  Stir it up real good get it all mixed
[30:17.780 --> 30:22.740]  Maybe consider adding a percentage of fresh soil to this mix
[30:22.740 --> 30:27.020]  I say that because that old soil is burnt. It's dead. There's nothing in there
[30:27.100 --> 30:30.860]  Maybe add some fresh soil add some more perlite just to give it a little bit of life
[30:30.980 --> 30:33.940]  So then once you've got that all mixed in put it into your pots
[30:33.940 --> 30:35.780]  I don't know if you're using threes fives or sevens
[30:35.780 --> 30:39.660]  But put it into the pots then water those pots with recharge and enzymes
[30:39.740 --> 30:43.180]  That is going to reactivate your soil and revitalize your soil
[30:43.260 --> 30:48.780]  Now you are back to that original pro mix because that pro mix is sold with mycorrhizal mix inside of there
[30:48.780 --> 30:51.420]  So you need to add something to get you back to ground zero?
[30:51.940 --> 30:55.260]  So we've got it all cleaned up we've got it re
[30:56.140 --> 30:58.980]  My code we've got an enzyme to start cleaning stuff out
[30:58.980 --> 31:02.600]  I think that is going to work safely for you in my opinion
[31:02.600 --> 31:05.860]  That is probably the most effective and efficient way to do it
[31:05.860 --> 31:10.380]  Make sure that you flushed heavily before you harvested make sure you get all those root balls out of there
[31:10.380 --> 31:14.780]  Put some mycos in there put some enzymes in there before you plant your plants water at once
[31:14.780 --> 31:18.940]  Maybe water it twice let it dry then do your normal transplant method
[31:19.180 --> 31:23.340]  But if you had any bugs any problems I would not do this
[31:23.500 --> 31:29.180]  This is much much easier in cocoa than it is in soil or soil is mix in
[31:29.500 --> 31:35.580]  Cocoa cocoa doesn't hold anything you can run a bunch of water through the cocoa and all the nutrients all the stuff will strip right out
[31:35.580 --> 31:40.700]  Of there then you can measure the EC or the pH or the ppms of the water that's coming out and you could tell there's nothing
[31:40.700 --> 31:45.980]  Left in there. That's not as easy in soil or dirt, but I think you will be successful
[31:46.140 --> 31:52.300]  I know you're a smart guy. So i'm sure you will know this is probably good soil to recycle or bad soil to recycle
[31:52.540 --> 31:54.860]  You can tell if you had bugs if you had problems
[31:54.940 --> 31:58.060]  That's when you're not going to want to do it if it looks healthy if it feels good in your hands
[31:58.300 --> 32:02.380]  Go ahead and do it if it doesn't feel good to your hands if it doesn't feel good in your heart avoid it
[32:02.460 --> 32:06.860]  I think you will know better. Where do we go from there? Because there are more parts to this question
[32:07.660 --> 32:07.980]  All right
[32:07.980 --> 32:13.360]  The next part of the message says during covet 19 my access to ro water from the store could be restricted
[32:13.760 --> 32:20.640]  If the situation arises that I cannot get ro would the calcium buildup do any harm in my veg tent or would it just build?
[32:20.720 --> 32:22.720]  white powder on everything
[32:22.960 --> 32:27.840]  Uh, that's a really good question. Honestly. I do not use ro water in my personal grows
[32:27.920 --> 32:33.760]  I don't use ro water in most of my commercial grows here in colorado. We've got pretty good pretty clean water
[32:34.080 --> 32:38.320]  Um at the commercial grows I use a big boy filter. That's all I use it
[32:38.320 --> 32:41.840]  It's not ro in a personal grow. I use it straight from the hose
[32:42.160 --> 32:45.840]  So I am not using ro water and I do not experience any issues
[32:46.160 --> 32:51.760]  Ro water kind of makes things a little bit more challenging because it's harder to adjust the ph there's no buffering in there
[32:52.080 --> 32:56.880]  So I think you will be just fine if you are not able to get to your ro water
[32:56.960 --> 33:04.720]  Especially if you're using the hp pro mix and the nutrients you listed, uh, there will be no problems not using the ro water
[33:05.040 --> 33:06.720]  you may need to uh
[33:06.720 --> 33:13.040]  Adjust the amount of calmag you are feeding the plants because that calmag is in the calcium is actually in the ro water
[33:13.280 --> 33:16.240]  But I don't think it will make a huge difference pay attention to that
[33:16.720 --> 33:19.680]  There is more it says I don't know if you have an answer for this
[33:19.840 --> 33:26.420]  But I remember hearing on one episode not to mix liquid add-ons with organics. I'm currently using gaia greens all-purpose
[33:26.880 --> 33:32.720]  Uh with dry dry amendments, I would would I be able to use liquid karma without doing any harm?
[33:33.040 --> 33:36.640]  Is there even is there any cons to mixing the two?
[33:37.840 --> 33:42.240]  Um, I think you will be okay mixing liquid karma in with that organic mix
[33:42.640 --> 33:47.280]  the thing to think about when you are working with organics and bottled nutrients is
[33:47.920 --> 33:51.600]  whatever is in that bottle is chelated and buffered and
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.480]  Really concentrated and who knows if I don't know if the product you are using is going to kill off your organics
[33:58.480 --> 34:03.840]  Some of the buffers some of the you're from canada. So there are chelates in canada in uh, the states
[34:03.840 --> 34:09.680]  It's uh, chelation. We say she late chelate. I don't know the words are different up there. I just confused my own brain, but uh,
[34:10.400 --> 34:12.960]  worry about the uh, the salt nutrients
[34:13.500 --> 34:16.800]  Destroying your micos if you're using a lot of organic stuff
[34:16.880 --> 34:20.260]  Those bottled salt nutrients can wreak havoc on your organics
[34:20.560 --> 34:24.320]  It all depends on what products you are using together. Some things will work together
[34:24.400 --> 34:30.480]  Some things will not it is always best though in my opinion if you're going to run organics stick with organics if you're going to
[34:30.480 --> 34:33.680]  use synthetics stick with the synthetics because there may be
[34:34.320 --> 34:38.480]  You may just be killing off one thing by adding the other I am not a chemistry expert
[34:38.640 --> 34:42.800]  Organic chemistry is not my area of expertise. I am not the organic grower
[34:42.880 --> 34:46.640]  I do the bottles and salts so I know that there's no problem in my mix
[34:46.960 --> 34:51.680]  However, liquid karma is a very gentle product. That is seabird guano. That is kelp
[34:51.920 --> 34:56.080]  Uh, there are a couple other things that I can't remember in there, but they are uh, they're basically organic
[34:56.620 --> 35:02.800]  Ingredients and I do not foresee a problem by mixing the liquid karma in with your gaia products
[35:03.200 --> 35:04.720]  Gaia products, right?
[35:04.720 --> 35:08.560]  Yes, gaia greens. Okay, so there should not be a problem with that. Um
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.040]  I feel like i've covered you do list the details of your grow
[35:13.200 --> 35:15.840]  We don't need to cover that because I think i've answered your questions
[35:16.160 --> 35:21.360]  Uh tanto wraps it up with lastly i'm very excited to tell you that i've ordered some of your genetics boy
[35:21.360 --> 35:24.400]  Am I excited to see your grow with my genetics in there?
[35:24.560 --> 35:26.480]  It says I picked up some orange gasm
[35:26.480 --> 35:27.680]  Shout out to the orange gasm
[35:27.680 --> 35:31.200]  If you're not if you're watching the video, you can see i'm wearing the orange gasm t-shirt
[35:31.200 --> 35:36.320]  You can get that on my website at ireadgenetics.com click on the I think it says i restore
[35:36.720 --> 35:42.000]  Click on that get yourself an orange gasm t-shirt. There are orange gasm shirts lemon jeffrey t-shirts
[35:42.160 --> 35:46.720]  There are golden goat shirts on the website. There's an iread genetics logo t-shirt
[35:46.960 --> 35:53.600]  There is a grow from your heart podcast t-shirt up there and maybe just maybe by the time this episode airs or a couple of
[35:53.600 --> 35:59.520]  Days shortly thereafter there will be brand new iry army t-shirts available on the website
[35:59.520 --> 36:06.800]  The new iry army t-shirts are gray. They're on the way. They're supposed to be here monday. However, uh shipping is basically
[36:07.120 --> 36:10.400]  At a standstill right now. All the tracking numbers have just stopped updating
[36:10.720 --> 36:15.600]  I am rambling now, but get yourself some iry genetics t-shirts and I will get back into tanto's message
[36:16.400 --> 36:20.560]  Tonto has got uh, orange gasm lemon jeffrey and strawberry starburst coming
[36:20.800 --> 36:23.760]  I will start posting pics most likely around the fall
[36:24.080 --> 36:29.600]  I heard you last night on instagram saying no one ever follows through and I will yes a lot of people say hey
[36:29.600 --> 36:33.440]  I'm growing this strain and I say send me pictures, bro, and I don't get pictures of it
[36:33.760 --> 36:36.000]  That's cool. A few people do send me amazing pics
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.320]  It looks like tanto is going to send me some great pictures and I cannot wait it says
[36:40.800 --> 36:44.080]  Uh, where are we? They won't be the last but I will I do have intentions
[36:44.080 --> 36:48.160]  Oh, they won't be the best but I will bro pictures are pictures. They may be amazing
[36:48.400 --> 36:54.480]  Who knows what you're gonna send me? It does say I do have intentions of starting my first breeding project sometime next year
[36:54.560 --> 36:56.560]  So once again from the bottom of my heart
[36:56.640 --> 37:00.800]  Thank you for all that you do for this community and arming us new growers with knowledge
[37:01.200 --> 37:06.960]  If you are ever up in canada, please let me know from your friend tanto
[37:06.960 --> 37:10.960]  Hey tanto, I may come visit you one day up there in canada. I've never been to canada
[37:11.120 --> 37:13.680]  I would love to go check it out. I need to go visit my friend the dude
[37:13.840 --> 37:15.840]  There are a couple of grows up there that have invited me
[37:16.080 --> 37:20.400]  So one day bro, you may need to uh clear off some couch space a lot of couch space
[37:20.480 --> 37:24.800]  I'm, like six five dude, but i'm narrow so I just need one couch space clear off some space
[37:24.800 --> 37:28.720]  Because I may need some place to crash one day get to smoke some of that great canadian herb with you
[37:29.280 --> 37:32.960]  Hey tanto. Thank you for the great message. I hope I answered all of your questions
[37:32.960 --> 37:36.960]  I feel like I was quite rambly and going quite fast, but I feel like this was a good fun podcast
[37:37.280 --> 37:40.560]  I want to wish you a happy holidays brother you and your whole family a happy holidays
[37:40.960 --> 37:43.120]  I hope everything goes well for you up there in canadia
[37:43.280 --> 37:49.440]  If you've got any more questions, please do reach out if anybody else out there has any questions corrections comments or concerns
[37:49.440 --> 37:50.560]  You can reach out as well
[37:50.560 --> 37:54.960]  My email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com and I do look forward to hearing from you
[37:55.360 --> 37:59.460]  Please do not be shy. Also make sure to check out the website at ireadgenetics.com
[38:00.480 --> 38:05.520]  All things i read genetics rasta jeff grow from your heart. It will all be right there on the website
[38:05.600 --> 38:09.360]  You can find seed vendors. You can find shirts. You can find the podcast
[38:09.600 --> 38:12.480]  You can find a contact me tab. There's a grow help tab
[38:12.880 --> 38:16.720]  A lot of people have taken advantage of that grow help tab if you've got a grow question
[38:17.040 --> 38:21.680]  There are a few questions that I ask you on that website. Like what is the temperature of your room?
[38:21.760 --> 38:24.080]  What's the humidity of your room? What are you feeding the plants?
[38:24.160 --> 38:29.360]  What was the ph of your last feed the reason I ask you those questions is because when you say hey rasta
[38:29.440 --> 38:31.360]  Jeff, my plant turned yellow. What's wrong?
[38:31.360 --> 38:34.320]  I'm going to send you another email that asks you all of those questions
[38:34.400 --> 38:36.480]  Anyway, and now i've skipped us both a step
[38:36.480 --> 38:41.200]  You've got to tell me the details of your room and of your problem before you can even send me the question
[38:41.360 --> 38:45.360]  That makes it easier for both of us. So take advantage of the grow help tab on
[38:45.980 --> 38:49.840]  Ireadgenetics.com send me your grow questions. I will answer your questions
[38:49.920 --> 38:52.960]  and if it's a really good question that I feel like other people may uh,
[38:53.520 --> 38:57.280]  Learn something from I will use it right here on the podcast. I may keep you anonymous
[38:57.360 --> 39:00.240]  There's an option to give me your name on there. Let me know what you think
