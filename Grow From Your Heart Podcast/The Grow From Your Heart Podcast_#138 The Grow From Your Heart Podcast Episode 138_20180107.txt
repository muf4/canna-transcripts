[00:17.850 --> 00:20.410]  Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.410 --> 00:22.090]  It's time for episode number 138
[00:22.090 --> 00:23.690]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.690 --> 00:27.590]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.590 --> 00:28.750]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.750 --> 00:30.070]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.070 --> 00:32.470]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:32.470 --> 00:34.490]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:34.490 --> 00:37.010]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:37.010 --> 00:39.770]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.770 --> 00:41.650]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.650 --> 00:43.570]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.570 --> 00:45.730]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.730 --> 00:47.410]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.410 --> 00:49.850]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.850 --> 00:53.450]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.330 --> 00:56.930]  Last night, the Mystic Roots band played
[00:56.930 --> 00:58.410]  at the Black Sheep in Colorado Springs
[00:58.410 --> 00:59.890]  and it was a great show.
[00:59.890 --> 01:03.210]  I had a great time, I danced my ass off, I sang my ass off.
[01:03.210 --> 01:04.410]  The Mystic Roots band came out
[01:04.410 --> 01:06.130]  and they played their first song
[01:06.130 --> 01:08.090]  and then they dedicated their second song
[01:08.090 --> 01:09.650]  to Irie Genetics and myself.
[01:09.650 --> 01:11.610]  And that song was Pass the Marijuana.
[01:11.610 --> 01:13.650]  So big shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots.
[01:13.650 --> 01:14.890]  Thanks for putting on a great show.
[01:14.890 --> 01:16.890]  Thanks for making me feel like a VIP.
[01:16.890 --> 01:17.810]  I had a great ass time.
[01:17.810 --> 01:19.890]  Also, big shout out to Catchafaya.
[01:19.890 --> 01:21.970]  And also a big thanks to everyone at the Black Sheep
[01:21.970 --> 01:23.410]  for letting us get down in there.
[01:23.410 --> 01:25.010]  There may have been some ganja smoking
[01:25.010 --> 01:26.490]  and nobody tried to stop us.
[01:26.490 --> 01:28.450]  So much love and respect to the Black Sheep
[01:28.450 --> 01:29.770]  in Colorado Springs.
[01:29.770 --> 01:30.690]  Big shout out to the bands.
[01:30.690 --> 01:31.810]  Big shout out to Catchafaya.
[01:31.810 --> 01:33.090]  They came all the way from New Zealand
[01:33.090 --> 01:34.530]  to play in the States.
[01:34.530 --> 01:35.370]  That band is pretty cool.
[01:35.370 --> 01:37.290]  I had a good time checking those guys out.
[01:37.290 --> 01:38.250]  But I really had a good time
[01:38.250 --> 01:40.010]  getting down to the Mystic Roots.
[01:40.010 --> 01:40.850]  I hope I saw you there.
[01:40.850 --> 01:42.210]  I hope we got a high five together.
[01:42.210 --> 01:43.050]  I hope we got a dab.
[01:43.050 --> 01:44.330]  I hope I got to shake your hand.
[01:44.330 --> 01:45.730]  I hope we saw each other and had a great time.
[01:45.730 --> 01:47.610]  Big shout out to Smiles and the crew.
[01:47.610 --> 01:48.970]  Big shout out to Jessica.
[01:48.970 --> 01:50.170]  All the wooks that I hung out with.
[01:50.170 --> 01:52.330]  I had a great time with you guys.
[01:52.330 --> 01:53.650]  All right, you guys, in this podcast,
[01:53.650 --> 01:56.210]  I have my friend Will, the Barefoot Grower over.
[01:56.210 --> 01:58.170]  And we also had Rob from Sour Seeds over.
[01:58.170 --> 02:00.970]  And we talked a whole bunch about breeding.
[02:00.970 --> 02:03.130]  My friend Fred Garvin sent me an email.
[02:03.130 --> 02:05.970]  And he asked about harvesting his first seed crop.
[02:05.970 --> 02:08.530]  Fred is halfway through his first breeding project.
[02:08.530 --> 02:09.890]  And he wanted a little bit of guidance
[02:09.890 --> 02:12.530]  on how to properly take down his seeded plants.
[02:12.530 --> 02:13.730]  How to get the seeds out of there.
[02:13.730 --> 02:15.690]  How to store them and how to care for them.
[02:16.530 --> 02:18.330]  So we're gonna give a long discussion
[02:18.330 --> 02:21.210]  on pulling the seeds out of your seeded plants.
[02:21.210 --> 02:22.250]  Before we get that far, you guys,
[02:22.250 --> 02:23.530]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friends
[02:23.530 --> 02:25.290]  at Elevate Glass in Colorado Springs.
[02:25.290 --> 02:28.170]  If you need a new rig, if you need a new nail,
[02:28.170 --> 02:29.170]  if you need a new dabber,
[02:29.170 --> 02:30.810]  if you're trying to buy a brand new e-nail,
[02:30.810 --> 02:32.570]  you can check out my friends at Elevate Glass.
[02:32.570 --> 02:34.810]  They're located at 517 South Cajon
[02:34.810 --> 02:37.090]  in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[02:37.090 --> 02:38.930]  Make sure you let them know Ross and Jeff sent you.
[02:38.930 --> 02:40.090]  And let them know that you're listening
[02:40.090 --> 02:41.490]  to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:41.490 --> 02:43.050]  We would both appreciate it.
[02:43.050 --> 02:44.490]  So make sure you check out Elevate Glass,
[02:44.490 --> 02:47.650]  517 South Cajon in Colorado Springs.
[02:47.650 --> 02:48.850]  You guys, I'm gonna let this music play
[02:48.850 --> 02:49.690]  for a couple of seconds.
[02:49.690 --> 02:51.410]  And when we get back, we will be joined
[02:51.410 --> 02:54.750]  by the Barefoot Grower and Rob from Sour Seeds.
[03:00.040 --> 03:02.000]  All right, podcast world, we are back.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  Joining me at the table is my good buddy, Will,
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.440]  also known as the Barefoot Grower.
[03:05.440 --> 03:06.600]  Welcome to the table, bro.
[03:06.600 --> 03:07.440]  What's going on, man?
[03:07.440 --> 03:09.120]  Hey, are you still blowing glass?
[03:09.120 --> 03:11.080]  Unfortunately, I kinda had to put that on hiatus for a while.
[03:11.080 --> 03:11.920]  Okay, I was just curious.
[03:11.920 --> 03:14.720]  I saw you change from Barefoot Blower or Glass,
[03:14.720 --> 03:15.560]  Barefoot Glass to Barefoot Grower.
[03:15.560 --> 03:16.640]  That's the Barefoot Blower.
[03:17.120 --> 03:20.720]  That's another podcast.
[03:20.720 --> 03:22.360]  That's a whole different type of podcast.
[03:22.360 --> 03:23.200]  Welcome to the show, man.
[03:23.200 --> 03:24.020]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:24.020 --> 03:24.860]  Thanks for having me, man.
[03:24.860 --> 03:26.360]  Also across the table from me is my good buddy,
[03:26.360 --> 03:27.440]  Rob from Sour Seeds.
[03:27.440 --> 03:28.280]  How you doing today, bro?
[03:28.280 --> 03:29.100]  What's going on?
[03:29.100 --> 03:29.940]  Good to be back.
[03:29.940 --> 03:30.780]  Man, we got Rob a little bit too high.
[03:30.780 --> 03:31.920]  He's got a funny look on his face,
[03:31.920 --> 03:33.280]  but I think he's gonna be all right in a minute.
[03:33.280 --> 03:35.280]  I got that Bill Cosby grin.
[03:35.280 --> 03:36.440]  Oh, shit.
[03:36.440 --> 03:38.640]  Oh, man, so you might be the Barefoot Blower.
[03:42.360 --> 03:43.640]  We're off to a good start.
[03:43.640 --> 03:44.760]  What do you say to that?
[03:44.760 --> 03:47.440]  This is not gonna turn into the Colorado podcast.
[03:48.520 --> 03:51.520]  I will get this back on the rails very quickly.
[03:51.520 --> 03:52.880]  So thanks for coming to the table, guys.
[03:52.880 --> 03:54.920]  Both these guys, we've been talking about how busy we are.
[03:54.920 --> 03:56.600]  We sat here for an hour and talked about
[03:56.600 --> 03:58.160]  how we don't have time for shit.
[04:00.480 --> 04:01.800]  Which is kind of funny if you ask me.
[04:01.800 --> 04:03.360]  So we're gonna talk about,
[04:03.360 --> 04:05.240]  our friend Fred Garvin sent me an email,
[04:05.240 --> 04:08.320]  and he is halfway through a seed breeding project.
[04:08.320 --> 04:10.960]  This is his first run trying to make seeds.
[04:10.960 --> 04:14.240]  He wants some guidance on how to harvest the seeds,
[04:14.600 --> 04:17.120]  maybe when to pull the seeds and things to look for.
[04:17.120 --> 04:20.360]  So I thought, shit, my buddy Rob breeds a lot of seeds.
[04:20.360 --> 04:21.240]  I breed a lot of seeds.
[04:21.240 --> 04:23.040]  We'll get Rob over to talk about it.
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.720]  Will was coming over to hang out and take some dabs.
[04:24.720 --> 04:25.960]  He brought a dope ass mothership.
[04:25.960 --> 04:28.320]  So I was like, hang out, we'll put you on a podcast.
[04:28.320 --> 04:31.680]  So we're gonna talk a little bit about seed breeding.
[04:31.680 --> 04:33.640]  Rob's got a bunch of notes.
[04:33.640 --> 04:35.120]  Is there anywhere you'd like to start with, bro?
[04:35.120 --> 04:37.560]  Because you were looking at that thing pretty intently.
[04:39.040 --> 04:40.520]  I think we should start from the beginning.
[04:40.520 --> 04:41.360]  Okay.
[04:41.640 --> 04:45.040]  Right, the moment, the conception basically.
[04:45.040 --> 04:47.120]  When the seed starts, when to pollinate,
[04:47.120 --> 04:50.600]  and how to pollinate the timing wise,
[04:50.600 --> 04:52.200]  Indica's versus Sativa's versus hybrid.
[04:52.200 --> 04:54.000]  So hopefully you've got yourself a solid male
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.120]  that we've talked about before.
[04:55.120 --> 04:57.200]  Actually, you came and talked about that with me.
[04:57.200 --> 04:58.440]  So hopefully you've got a solid male.
[04:58.440 --> 05:00.280]  You've got your females chosen,
[05:00.280 --> 05:03.880]  and now it is time to actually breed some plants.
[05:03.880 --> 05:07.880]  So if you're gonna pick some Indica plants,
[05:07.880 --> 05:10.920]  when should we start to pollinate our Indica plants?
[05:11.480 --> 05:12.520]  I would say between week three and four,
[05:12.520 --> 05:14.400]  when your bud sets really start to form up
[05:14.400 --> 05:15.400]  for the first time.
[05:16.400 --> 05:18.000]  I would say when they get about,
[05:18.880 --> 05:20.720]  you know, good nickel to quarter size.
[05:20.720 --> 05:21.560]  Okay.
[05:21.560 --> 05:23.280]  That way you got plenty of,
[05:23.280 --> 05:25.160]  because what it's really gonna determine down on
[05:25.160 --> 05:26.120]  is how many hairs you have,
[05:26.120 --> 05:27.840]  basically how many pistols you have.
[05:27.840 --> 05:30.720]  And they're what carry the pollen down
[05:30.720 --> 05:32.320]  to actually make the progress happen.
[05:32.320 --> 05:34.640]  So when you see the pistols nice and thick,
[05:34.640 --> 05:36.720]  it kind of looks like you got some little spiders going on.
[05:36.720 --> 05:39.320]  When those dandelions, when the hairs in the dandelions,
[05:39.360 --> 05:41.360]  I know that's such obvious terms,
[05:41.360 --> 05:43.360]  but when those pistols get thick and ready,
[05:43.360 --> 05:44.880]  that's when that plant is ovulating
[05:44.880 --> 05:46.760]  and it wants to receive that male pollen.
[05:46.760 --> 05:49.240]  So in your Indica plants, you're absolutely right.
[05:49.240 --> 05:52.360]  About three weeks-ish, about day 21 to about day 28-ish
[05:52.360 --> 05:54.120]  is usually when I try to hit an Indica plant.
[05:54.120 --> 05:55.240]  Indica-Domina hybrid,
[05:55.240 --> 05:56.960]  you can get away with maybe sometime week four,
[05:56.960 --> 05:59.360]  if it's bred out with a sative or something like that,
[05:59.360 --> 06:01.120]  has slightly longer flowering time.
[06:01.120 --> 06:03.520]  You know, you just really have to use your best judgment,
[06:03.520 --> 06:04.840]  you know, but typically week three
[06:04.840 --> 06:07.680]  is about the money for it, in my opinion.
[06:07.680 --> 06:10.400]  How about if we're working with a more sativa-dominant plant?
[06:10.400 --> 06:11.720]  Do you want to go a little bit later, you think?
[06:11.720 --> 06:14.360]  You do, you really do want to get a little bit later.
[06:14.360 --> 06:15.200]  And the reason being,
[06:15.200 --> 06:17.840]  because if you do a pollination too early,
[06:17.840 --> 06:20.100]  you're not going to get the seed stock you want.
[06:20.100 --> 06:21.800]  And then they also might be sitting in the plant
[06:21.800 --> 06:23.520]  for too long and the plant might not be ripe,
[06:23.520 --> 06:25.000]  but the seeds will be.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.280]  So the seeds will overripen,
[06:27.280 --> 06:29.720]  just like any fruit or anything else out there,
[06:29.720 --> 06:31.080]  it can overripen.
[06:31.080 --> 06:33.600]  I've seen them pop inside the bud before.
[06:33.600 --> 06:34.720]  I've seen all kinds of things.
[06:34.720 --> 06:36.340]  I've actually seen a seed germinate itself
[06:36.340 --> 06:37.180]  inside of a bud.
[06:37.660 --> 06:38.740]  That's fucking amazing.
[06:38.740 --> 06:39.580]  That is cool.
[06:39.580 --> 06:41.620]  When you guys say indica and sativa,
[06:41.620 --> 06:43.140]  you talking about the female you're using
[06:43.140 --> 06:45.140]  or the cross that you're trying to get?
[06:45.140 --> 06:46.620]  The female that we're starting with.
[06:46.620 --> 06:48.460]  Yeah, the girl that's going to receive the pollen.
[06:48.460 --> 06:49.280]  Yeah, the girl.
[06:49.280 --> 06:51.020]  That's why Will's here, to keep us on track.
[06:51.020 --> 06:51.860]  That's exactly it.
[06:51.860 --> 06:53.700]  That's a great question.
[06:53.700 --> 06:55.260]  Yeah, yeah, we're always,
[06:55.260 --> 06:56.620]  with that word, we're definitely referring
[06:56.620 --> 06:58.100]  to the female for sure.
[06:58.100 --> 06:58.940]  Okay, cool.
[07:00.060 --> 07:01.660]  Yeah, sativa-dominant plants,
[07:01.660 --> 07:03.880]  you can usually do week four, week five,
[07:03.880 --> 07:05.220]  usually typically a week or two later
[07:05.220 --> 07:06.420]  than you would an indica.
[07:06.580 --> 07:08.020]  You really have to judge the flowering period
[07:08.020 --> 07:09.900]  if it's a nine, 10 week sativa.
[07:09.900 --> 07:12.500]  You want to leave, basically what you're leaving
[07:12.500 --> 07:15.260]  and looking for is about a four to five week gap
[07:15.260 --> 07:17.580]  of just the plants going through growth,
[07:17.580 --> 07:21.620]  normal, regular, solid growth for about four to five weeks.
[07:21.620 --> 07:23.780]  That's going to make that seed go from start to finish
[07:23.780 --> 07:26.900]  and really finish out nicely from start to embryo
[07:26.900 --> 07:28.820]  to seed to harvest.
[07:28.820 --> 07:30.820]  All right, so we've got pollen.
[07:30.820 --> 07:33.700]  When should we put our males and females
[07:33.740 --> 07:35.900]  into the flowering room at the same time?
[07:37.260 --> 07:39.460]  I think it really depends on your situation.
[07:40.500 --> 07:42.140]  The easiest way to do it if somebody's worried
[07:42.140 --> 07:45.500]  about getting cross-pollination with other females
[07:45.500 --> 07:48.340]  and things like that is to bring the female out of the room
[07:48.340 --> 07:51.820]  or use a smaller room, maybe like a small two by two
[07:51.820 --> 07:53.340]  or three by three grow tent.
[07:53.340 --> 07:55.900]  I've seen people even go down and use something as cheap
[07:55.900 --> 07:58.360]  as a very large cardboard box,
[07:58.360 --> 08:00.180]  like something for a refrigerator
[08:00.180 --> 08:02.260]  or like the largest box you can get at U-Haul.
[08:02.580 --> 08:05.180]  Put a CFL in it for your males and stuff like that
[08:05.180 --> 08:07.060]  and just let them go and then throw the female in there
[08:07.060 --> 08:09.540]  just for the day or two it needs to do its thing.
[08:09.540 --> 08:11.740]  And then pull it back out.
[08:11.740 --> 08:14.540]  And then the deed is done, let it sit,
[08:14.540 --> 08:15.860]  spray it down with tap water,
[08:15.860 --> 08:17.340]  introduce it back into the flower room
[08:17.340 --> 08:19.540]  so you don't cross-pollinate.
[08:19.540 --> 08:22.620]  The way I do it, when I pollinate, I do the whole room.
[08:22.620 --> 08:23.860]  I don't even fuck around.
[08:23.860 --> 08:25.940]  I know that I'm going to do the entire room.
[08:25.940 --> 08:27.900]  So I'll get that male nice and beefy.
[08:27.900 --> 08:29.180]  And when he's full of pollen,
[08:29.180 --> 08:30.980]  and hopefully I've got him timed up to where my girls
[08:30.980 --> 08:32.100]  are about three to four weeks in,
[08:32.940 --> 08:33.940]  I just take him in there and put him in front of the fan
[08:33.940 --> 08:36.460]  and give him a good shake, smack the sticks a little bit.
[08:36.460 --> 08:39.100]  And that pollen goes everywhere, everywhere.
[08:39.100 --> 08:41.700]  But that's only if you're trying to do the whole room.
[08:41.700 --> 08:43.460]  If you're trying to time it and you don't know
[08:43.460 --> 08:45.380]  how long your male plant is going to take
[08:45.380 --> 08:47.040]  to start busting a nut,
[08:47.040 --> 08:49.260]  that's when it's time to flower him early
[08:49.260 --> 08:51.740]  and take pollen from him and collect the pollen
[08:51.740 --> 08:53.020]  into a container.
[08:53.020 --> 08:55.700]  And then you can apply pollen to the branches you want,
[08:55.700 --> 08:57.460]  or you can walk in there and hold that jar of pollen
[08:57.460 --> 08:59.340]  in front of a fan and shake it.
[08:59.340 --> 09:00.500]  You can kind of salt and pepper,
[09:00.500 --> 09:02.420]  sprinkle the plants if you'd like.
[09:02.420 --> 09:03.980]  There are several ways to apply the pollen.
[09:03.980 --> 09:05.700]  That's exactly how I do it as a breeder.
[09:05.700 --> 09:10.020]  I harvest pollen first and then choose females secondly.
[09:10.020 --> 09:10.860]  Okay.
[09:10.860 --> 09:11.700]  So I always harvest pollen.
[09:11.700 --> 09:13.020]  I keep good storage of pollen.
[09:13.020 --> 09:15.560]  A good way to store pollen is a good question.
[09:16.780 --> 09:20.020]  I get asked all the time, how do you store your pollen?
[09:20.020 --> 09:22.020]  I just use a very clean container.
[09:22.020 --> 09:25.020]  I wipe it out with alcohol first, let it dry really good,
[09:25.020 --> 09:26.140]  and then wipe it out with water
[09:26.140 --> 09:27.500]  to make sure there's no alcohol left
[09:27.500 --> 09:29.140]  that's going to kill the pollen.
[09:29.140 --> 09:30.540]  And I don't use tap water.
[09:30.540 --> 09:32.420]  I use an RO water or distilled water.
[09:32.420 --> 09:33.860]  That way there's no chlorine present,
[09:33.860 --> 09:35.460]  so it won't destroy the pollen.
[09:35.460 --> 09:36.820]  Right. Let it dry real well.
[09:36.820 --> 09:38.300]  That's it. Let it dry really well.
[09:38.300 --> 09:41.780]  You can use a dried rice is a really good thing to use.
[09:41.780 --> 09:43.260]  I've seen growers use dried rice,
[09:43.260 --> 09:45.740]  but the main thing is when you go to store pollen
[09:45.740 --> 09:47.940]  is to make sure there's no green material left over
[09:47.940 --> 09:50.220]  or any kind of bud material or leaf material
[09:50.220 --> 09:52.780]  present in the pollen whenever you're going through there
[09:52.780 --> 09:53.700]  after harvesting it.
[09:53.700 --> 09:55.220]  Because there's going to be little pieces here and there.
[09:55.220 --> 09:56.580]  And what that's going to do is it's going to create
[09:56.580 --> 09:59.100]  a moisture spot inside of that pollen.
[09:59.100 --> 10:00.340]  And it's going to start molding.
[10:00.340 --> 10:02.660]  And that's where you can, because water breeds bacteria.
[10:02.660 --> 10:04.060]  That's basically what it boils down to.
[10:04.060 --> 10:05.380]  And the bacteria is going to take over
[10:05.380 --> 10:07.460]  and it's going to render your pollen useless.
[10:07.460 --> 10:09.300]  I do a very similar method.
[10:09.300 --> 10:11.460]  I'll collect the pollen from the male
[10:11.460 --> 10:13.060]  and then I will have a clone of that male
[10:13.060 --> 10:15.380]  and I'll flower him right alongside my ladies
[10:15.380 --> 10:17.820]  so that I'm sure that right around the proper day,
[10:17.820 --> 10:19.720]  I know that each of my ladies will get dusted
[10:19.720 --> 10:21.780]  with the proper amount of pollen.
[10:21.780 --> 10:23.860]  So I'm double teaming it a little bit.
[10:23.860 --> 10:25.020]  And I'm kind of a weirdo.
[10:25.020 --> 10:26.460]  I might be a cannabis hoarder
[10:26.460 --> 10:28.740]  because I always like to keep a little bit of pollen.
[10:29.420 --> 10:30.260]  Like just in case something goes wrong,
[10:30.260 --> 10:31.660]  I've still got some of that pollen.
[10:31.660 --> 10:32.700]  That's what I love to do.
[10:32.700 --> 10:33.540]  Keep it back.
[10:33.540 --> 10:34.860]  You never know when you're going to come across something
[10:34.860 --> 10:36.180]  and say, you know,
[10:36.180 --> 10:38.220]  that one male would be really good with that female.
[10:38.220 --> 10:39.060]  Right.
[10:39.060 --> 10:40.300]  And it'd be a new cut that you just got
[10:40.300 --> 10:41.220]  and ran for the first time.
[10:41.220 --> 10:43.180]  And you realize, hey, wait a minute.
[10:43.180 --> 10:45.260]  If I would have had that male or if I had that pollen,
[10:45.260 --> 10:46.860]  I could have just made a masterpiece.
[10:46.860 --> 10:47.700]  Yeah.
[10:47.700 --> 10:48.520]  You know?
[10:48.520 --> 10:49.360]  Yeah.
[10:49.360 --> 10:50.200]  So I've got that pollen.
[10:50.200 --> 10:51.020]  Like you were saying,
[10:51.020 --> 10:51.860]  keep it in a clean jar or a container.
[10:51.860 --> 10:53.980]  I keep mine in a clean, those little tiny Mason jars,
[10:53.980 --> 10:55.900]  like a baby food size Mason jar.
[10:55.900 --> 10:57.720]  And then I keep that in a brown paper bag.
[10:57.720 --> 10:58.880]  So there's no light getting to it.
[10:58.880 --> 11:01.920]  And then I actually put that in my spare refrigerator
[11:01.920 --> 11:04.200]  right next to my silver thiosulfate solution.
[11:04.200 --> 11:05.040]  Yeah.
[11:05.040 --> 11:06.560]  That's where it's next to the STS in the fridge.
[11:06.560 --> 11:07.400]  Exactly.
[11:07.400 --> 11:09.360]  Is there a reason to keep it in the fridge
[11:09.360 --> 11:12.440]  other than just like the light and protection thing?
[11:12.440 --> 11:14.360]  I think cold is more preservative than heat.
[11:14.360 --> 11:15.200]  Exactly.
[11:15.200 --> 11:17.120]  I think things will deteriorate and degrade
[11:17.120 --> 11:19.000]  and shit goes wrong more quickly in heat.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.080]  In nature, cold slows everything down.
[11:21.080 --> 11:23.320]  So that's, you keep your food and your meats and shit.
[11:23.320 --> 11:24.840]  I don't keep any meat, but I mean,
[11:24.840 --> 11:27.080]  if you do, you keep that shit in a fridge, keep it cool.
[11:27.800 --> 11:29.680]  It'll keep your pollen viable for longer.
[11:29.680 --> 11:30.520]  Yeah.
[11:30.520 --> 11:32.400]  I also keep some seeds in a cooler
[11:32.400 --> 11:34.680]  and I haven't seen any difference in the seeds
[11:34.680 --> 11:37.220]  that I have kept not in a cooler and in a cooler.
[11:37.220 --> 11:38.440]  My other seeds go in a safe.
[11:38.440 --> 11:40.660]  I've got a big gun safe filled with seeds.
[11:40.660 --> 11:42.000]  The seeds that were in the cooler,
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.600]  I've germinated those with the same exact success rate
[11:44.600 --> 11:45.920]  as non-cooled seeds.
[11:45.920 --> 11:46.760]  Absolutely.
[11:46.760 --> 11:47.920]  Yeah.
[11:47.920 --> 11:48.760]  All right.
[11:48.760 --> 11:50.880]  So we know when to pollinate the plants.
[11:50.880 --> 11:53.520]  We know it's going to take about five to six weeks
[11:53.520 --> 11:54.360]  for those plants.
[11:54.360 --> 11:55.520]  Once the pollination happens,
[11:55.520 --> 11:57.880]  you'll see the pistils curl up.
[11:57.880 --> 11:59.700]  Right now they'll be clear looking, they're white.
[11:59.700 --> 12:02.000]  They're kind of like clear, veiny, white tips.
[12:02.000 --> 12:02.920]  Once that pollen hits,
[12:02.920 --> 12:04.560]  they're going to crinkle up like claws,
[12:04.560 --> 12:06.520]  like arthritis fingers.
[12:06.520 --> 12:08.280]  They're going to start turning brown.
[12:08.280 --> 12:09.880]  That's how you know the pollination has happened.
[12:09.880 --> 12:14.240]  Now the pollen is moving up the pistil and into the ovule
[12:14.240 --> 12:16.880]  and you're now actually making a seed.
[12:16.880 --> 12:18.880]  Let's talk a little bit about what to feed plants
[12:18.880 --> 12:21.800]  that we're putting seeds into.
[12:21.800 --> 12:23.160]  I like to give them a lot of carbs.
[12:23.160 --> 12:24.640]  I like to give them a lot of carbs and sugars.
[12:24.640 --> 12:25.480]  Lots of energy.
[12:25.480 --> 12:26.320]  And a good little bloom booster.
[12:26.320 --> 12:28.480]  That's about all I really do to them other than that.
[12:28.480 --> 12:30.320]  I do give them a little extra nitrogen or flour
[12:30.320 --> 12:32.080]  than I normally would because the plant's going to use
[12:32.080 --> 12:33.160]  a little bit of extra everything.
[12:33.160 --> 12:34.000]  Just like a mom would.
[12:34.000 --> 12:34.920]  Absolutely.
[12:34.920 --> 12:36.200]  Create a baby inside of her.
[12:36.200 --> 12:37.480]  She's going to try to, she's going to eat,
[12:37.480 --> 12:38.720]  she's got to eat too.
[12:38.720 --> 12:40.400]  So you got to take that concept
[12:40.400 --> 12:41.600]  and relay that into your plan.
[12:41.600 --> 12:43.560]  You know, you're creating thousands of seeds
[12:43.560 --> 12:44.920]  so those offspring you have,
[12:44.920 --> 12:47.720]  they need nutrients, they need food
[12:47.720 --> 12:49.680]  to be able to grow healthy and strong,
[12:49.680 --> 12:52.000]  just like a baby would or anything else would.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.720]  Completely use as much light as possible
[12:54.720 --> 12:55.560]  when you're breeding.
[12:55.560 --> 12:57.480]  Light is definitely helpful.
[12:57.480 --> 12:59.000]  You'll multiply your amounts of seeds.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.200]  If you step up from a 400 to a 600 to a 1,000,
[13:02.200 --> 13:03.660]  you'll see the amount of seeds you produce
[13:03.660 --> 13:04.840]  and the quality of the seeds.
[13:04.840 --> 13:07.240]  Those little white seeds won't happen if you use 1,000.
[13:07.240 --> 13:09.040]  You only get those with a four or a six.
[13:09.040 --> 13:09.880]  That's it.
[13:09.880 --> 13:11.720]  Yeah, I actually use sixes.
[13:11.720 --> 13:14.840]  I do a 12-12 regimen when I go into flower
[13:14.840 --> 13:15.720]  for a breeding project.
[13:15.720 --> 13:16.560]  Yeah.
[13:16.560 --> 13:17.400]  Yeah.
[13:17.400 --> 13:19.240]  But I actually, I use 600s,
[13:19.240 --> 13:20.760]  but even like you were saying,
[13:20.760 --> 13:24.040]  it will help mature faster with a brighter light source
[13:24.040 --> 13:25.280]  or a hotter light source.
[13:25.280 --> 13:28.080]  And so typically what I do like this time of year,
[13:28.080 --> 13:30.520]  I take them and put them outside for the last week to ripen,
[13:30.520 --> 13:32.240]  let the UV rays really take an over.
[13:32.240 --> 13:35.360]  And not only does it increase the THC
[13:35.360 --> 13:37.400]  and bombard the plant at all at one time,
[13:37.400 --> 13:40.000]  it really looks good on the charts after it's cut down.
[13:40.000 --> 13:40.840]  Oh, I bet.
[13:40.840 --> 13:41.680]  Yeah.
[13:41.680 --> 13:44.440]  There's something about making oil out of plants
[13:44.440 --> 13:45.800]  that were seeded.
[13:45.800 --> 13:46.640]  Once those plants,
[13:46.640 --> 13:47.820]  so we'll talk about this in a minute,
[13:47.820 --> 13:49.800]  but once the plants are finished,
[13:49.840 --> 13:50.840]  you take the seeds out
[13:50.840 --> 13:52.520]  and you've got a bunch of material left.
[13:52.520 --> 13:54.500]  I like to take that material to one of my good friends,
[13:54.500 --> 13:56.320]  like Will, that makes hash for me.
[13:56.320 --> 13:58.200]  And the concentrates that come out of that,
[13:58.200 --> 13:59.960]  you get such an amazing high.
[13:59.960 --> 14:02.160]  There's some, it's all, there's more of a,
[14:02.160 --> 14:04.200]  and you know, I don't get a psychedelic high,
[14:04.200 --> 14:06.200]  but it is more of a psychedelic feeling.
[14:06.200 --> 14:07.780]  You get more of a mind trip from it.
[14:07.780 --> 14:09.160]  You get more body high from it.
[14:09.160 --> 14:10.840]  It does something to the oil.
[14:10.840 --> 14:12.480]  It certainly does.
[14:12.480 --> 14:13.400]  All right.
[14:13.400 --> 14:15.960]  So we know what to feed the plants.
[14:15.960 --> 14:17.200]  Now we want to give them lots of carbs,
[14:17.200 --> 14:19.160]  a little more nitrogen.
[14:19.360 --> 14:20.440]  You're still going to have to flush
[14:20.440 --> 14:22.320]  just like you normally would before you cut down the plants.
[14:22.320 --> 14:23.440]  You guys keep that in mind.
[14:23.440 --> 14:24.280]  Always flush.
[14:24.280 --> 14:27.740]  I wanted to interrupt with something that I saw on Facebook.
[14:27.740 --> 14:28.700]  I won't call them out,
[14:28.700 --> 14:30.440]  but hopefully they listen to the podcast.
[14:30.440 --> 14:31.800]  They posted to Facebook,
[14:31.800 --> 14:33.560]  I found this stud male,
[14:33.560 --> 14:35.440]  time to put him outside for the season
[14:35.440 --> 14:38.820]  and see what he can do so that I can collect some pollen
[14:38.820 --> 14:40.640]  is essentially what he said.
[14:40.640 --> 14:42.480]  So many bells went off in my head.
[14:42.480 --> 14:43.560]  I saw that post.
[14:43.560 --> 14:44.400]  Yeah.
[14:44.400 --> 14:45.920]  Yeah.
[14:45.920 --> 14:48.400]  Everybody for four miles of this dude
[14:48.400 --> 14:51.480]  that is growing outdoors is going to have a hybrid
[14:51.480 --> 14:53.680]  of whatever this dude put outside.
[14:53.680 --> 14:54.600]  Yeah.
[14:54.600 --> 14:57.840]  The wind and nature are going to do their things.
[14:57.840 --> 14:59.920]  And this guy's going to pollinate
[14:59.920 --> 15:01.600]  the whole fucking neighborhood.
[15:02.480 --> 15:03.320]  Don't do that.
[15:03.320 --> 15:04.280]  You guys, if you've got a male plant,
[15:04.280 --> 15:06.080]  don't put it outside so that you can pollinate
[15:06.080 --> 15:08.640]  Rob's outdoor crops and you can fucking pollinate
[15:08.640 --> 15:10.000]  everybody's outdoor crop.
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.040]  Don't do that shit.
[15:11.040 --> 15:14.760]  Please be a thinkful thinker, a thinkful stoner.
[15:14.760 --> 15:16.440]  I don't even be a forethinking grower
[15:16.440 --> 15:18.000]  is what I need you to be.
[15:18.600 --> 15:19.440]  Don't put that shit out there.
[15:19.440 --> 15:20.280]  That's rude.
[15:20.280 --> 15:21.100]  Please don't do that.
[15:22.280 --> 15:23.120]  Wow.
[15:23.120 --> 15:24.520]  These guys are shaking their heads in silence.
[15:24.520 --> 15:25.600]  They think they just want to stand up
[15:25.600 --> 15:27.640]  and walk away from the table.
[15:27.640 --> 15:29.440]  Like fuck, I'm done.
[15:29.440 --> 15:30.280]  That's good.
[15:30.280 --> 15:31.100]  Yeah.
[15:31.100 --> 15:32.880]  You can take a cry break if you need to.
[15:32.880 --> 15:35.200]  People have taken naps on that couch over there.
[15:35.200 --> 15:37.080]  A cry break would be acceptable.
[15:37.080 --> 15:37.920]  All right.
[15:37.920 --> 15:39.760]  So plants are going to grow about six weeks
[15:39.760 --> 15:42.560]  until the seeds are ready-ish.
[15:42.560 --> 15:45.440]  What should we start looking for during that time period
[15:45.440 --> 15:46.840]  to know if the seeds are getting ready
[15:46.840 --> 15:48.040]  or if we're going to have to let them go
[15:48.040 --> 15:49.120]  a little bit longer?
[15:49.120 --> 15:51.560]  Well, usually what I'll do if there's none,
[15:51.560 --> 15:56.080]  sometimes they'll split and you'll actually start
[15:56.080 --> 15:59.160]  seeing the seeds present on the plant.
[15:59.160 --> 16:01.480]  On the undersides of the buds with the calyx as well?
[16:01.480 --> 16:02.320]  That's it.
[16:02.320 --> 16:03.160]  The calyx is a split.
[16:03.160 --> 16:04.760]  They'll actually split and the seed will actually
[16:04.760 --> 16:06.760]  protrude from it sometimes when they're ripe
[16:06.760 --> 16:08.800]  and then you'll actually see the visual seeds.
[16:08.800 --> 16:10.480]  You'll see a nice gray, dark color.
[16:10.480 --> 16:11.680]  You'll see nice tiger stripes.
[16:11.680 --> 16:12.800]  You know, the black tiger stripes
[16:12.800 --> 16:14.160]  is what you're looking for a lot of the time.
[16:14.160 --> 16:15.680]  Then you know you got a nice ripe seed.
[16:15.680 --> 16:18.960]  You basically want to look for no green and no white.
[16:18.960 --> 16:20.360]  That's pretty much the two things
[16:20.360 --> 16:21.200]  you really got to look for.
[16:21.200 --> 16:23.280]  If there's no green and no white and you got tiger stripes
[16:23.280 --> 16:25.640]  and you got nice gray seeds or dark seeds
[16:25.640 --> 16:28.200]  and typically you know you're ready.
[16:28.200 --> 16:32.160]  A cheat move that I do after about six weeks of pollination,
[16:32.160 --> 16:33.720]  five and a half, six weeks of pollination,
[16:33.720 --> 16:36.480]  I wait and then right at the base of the buds
[16:36.480 --> 16:37.920]  where the stalk and the bud meet,
[16:37.920 --> 16:40.840]  there's usually one little calyx that swells up.
[16:40.840 --> 16:42.080]  I'll just pinch that fucker off
[16:42.080 --> 16:44.560]  and roll it around in my hand and you'll know.
[16:44.600 --> 16:47.120]  It's either a seed or what would have been a seed
[16:47.120 --> 16:48.280]  had you not destroyed it.
[16:48.280 --> 16:50.240]  And you guys don't worry about crushing one or two of those
[16:50.240 --> 16:51.360]  because if you did this correctly,
[16:51.360 --> 16:54.240]  you're gonna have at least 100, closer to 500
[16:54.240 --> 16:56.320]  if you do it like Rob and I do.
[16:56.320 --> 16:59.160]  I've pulled 5,000 seeds from a plant before easily.
[16:59.160 --> 17:01.180]  I'm looking at pulling like around at least 1,000 or two
[17:01.180 --> 17:02.440]  from one plant right now.
[17:02.440 --> 17:04.280]  I was running seven gallon pots
[17:04.280 --> 17:05.440]  and hitting them with big mails.
[17:05.440 --> 17:06.280]  I'm running 10.
[17:06.280 --> 17:07.100]  Yeah.
[17:07.100 --> 17:08.760]  Pulled quite a few.
[17:08.760 --> 17:11.680]  Yeah, thousands of seeds can come from one plant.
[17:11.680 --> 17:12.920]  Where the hell were we?
[17:12.920 --> 17:13.760]  How long to let it go?
[17:13.760 --> 17:14.600]  That's what to look for.
[17:14.600 --> 17:16.160]  You can pinch that one little,
[17:16.160 --> 17:17.320]  like you guys will see what I'm talking about.
[17:17.320 --> 17:18.520]  If you've got a seeded crop,
[17:18.520 --> 17:20.160]  and a lot of times you'll see these little calyxes
[17:20.160 --> 17:21.000]  on the bottoms of buds
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.360]  and they'll make you think you've got a seed.
[17:23.360 --> 17:26.000]  I did want to touch on letting them go
[17:26.000 --> 17:26.960]  a little bit too long.
[17:26.960 --> 17:28.840]  What happens with the ramifications
[17:28.840 --> 17:30.600]  of letting your seeds go too terribly long
[17:30.600 --> 17:32.840]  and letting the plant just basically go into the point
[17:32.840 --> 17:34.880]  where A, you're gonna lose most of your THC.
[17:34.880 --> 17:38.160]  It's gonna convert over to CBD and things like that.
[17:38.160 --> 17:40.120]  And then secondly, the seed.
[17:40.120 --> 17:42.640]  Not in the progeny, in the bud that's actually growing.
[17:42.640 --> 17:44.880]  I don't know if you've ever had those seeds,
[17:44.880 --> 17:47.400]  had a batch of seeds from somebody or a breeder
[17:47.400 --> 17:50.360]  that you've gotten in and they're just hard as a rock.
[17:50.360 --> 17:51.960]  And they got really great dark,
[17:51.960 --> 17:53.040]  they're real dark, nice,
[17:53.040 --> 17:55.060]  but I mean, they're just incredibly hard as rock.
[17:55.060 --> 17:56.880]  A lot of them have to be scored germinate.
[17:56.880 --> 17:57.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:57.720 --> 17:58.540]  I know what you're talking about.
[17:58.540 --> 17:59.380]  That's what that's from.
[17:59.380 --> 18:00.200]  That's a lot of it.
[18:00.200 --> 18:01.040]  Basically what it is,
[18:01.040 --> 18:02.840]  it's because the seed is this embryo
[18:02.840 --> 18:04.520]  and it's developing a shell.
[18:04.520 --> 18:05.640]  It's developing that shell
[18:05.640 --> 18:07.640]  and that shell is gonna do nothing but like a bone.
[18:07.640 --> 18:09.820]  It's gonna get harder and harder and harder
[18:09.820 --> 18:11.080]  the more you pump that plant
[18:11.160 --> 18:13.200]  and especially it comes from not ripening the plant
[18:13.200 --> 18:15.760]  correctly also, not flushing properly,
[18:15.760 --> 18:18.160]  things like that because you got so many nutrients present,
[18:18.160 --> 18:20.600]  it's still telling it to drive, drive, drive, drive.
[18:20.600 --> 18:22.520]  So it's gonna create that and develop that.
[18:22.520 --> 18:24.720]  And that's also when you risk seed splitting.
[18:24.720 --> 18:27.160]  Seed splitting will happen because whenever you pull them out
[18:27.160 --> 18:28.520]  they're gonna be so overdeveloped
[18:28.520 --> 18:29.800]  that once they start to dry out,
[18:29.800 --> 18:31.120]  they're gonna start cracking and splitting
[18:31.120 --> 18:32.360]  because it's gonna be like,
[18:32.360 --> 18:35.400]  there's gonna be such a large embryo inside of this shell
[18:35.400 --> 18:38.360]  because it's swelled up inside of there, it's growing.
[18:38.360 --> 18:39.720]  So you're gonna have a lot of problems
[18:39.720 --> 18:40.880]  can develop from that.
[18:41.680 --> 18:42.520]  So that's a lot of the issues
[18:42.520 --> 18:43.680]  when people have these little issues with seeds
[18:43.680 --> 18:45.200]  when they get them in the mail and things like that
[18:45.200 --> 18:47.080]  from different breeders and they are cracked and stuff
[18:47.080 --> 18:49.240]  but they haven't been, the package is fine
[18:49.240 --> 18:51.920]  and they come great but you got a couple of cracked seeds
[18:51.920 --> 18:53.000]  in there and they look great and everything
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.600]  but you can tell just that shell split right down the side
[18:55.600 --> 18:57.320]  and you're like, hey, this is not gonna be good
[18:57.320 --> 18:59.460]  because the embryo is now dried out and dead.
[18:59.460 --> 19:01.840]  So that seed's toast and then you get some
[19:01.840 --> 19:04.040]  that you have to score because they just will not germinate
[19:04.040 --> 19:05.440]  unless you score them.
[19:05.440 --> 19:06.280]  And that's a lot of-
[19:06.280 --> 19:07.280]  Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[19:07.280 --> 19:09.400]  What's the best way to do, you guys, you'll know
[19:09.400 --> 19:11.480]  if the seeds are super hard, really thick shell
[19:11.480 --> 19:13.760]  you'll be able to tell by looking, they'll be extra glossy.
[19:13.760 --> 19:15.120]  They'll be a little harder than normal.
[19:15.120 --> 19:16.600]  If it's your first pack of seeds
[19:16.600 --> 19:17.760]  you don't have anything to compare it to
[19:17.760 --> 19:19.000]  so you're just gonna have to learn.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.640]  But what's the best way to score them
[19:20.640 --> 19:22.360]  to soften them up a little bit to get them to grow?
[19:22.360 --> 19:24.320]  If you've got a matchbook, that's a real good way to do it.
[19:24.320 --> 19:26.040]  If you've got a matchbook, use the side of a matchbook
[19:26.040 --> 19:28.560]  just rub them like that or really fine grit sandpaper.
[19:28.560 --> 19:29.720]  You don't wanna use a coarse grade
[19:29.720 --> 19:30.560]  because it's gonna tear it
[19:30.560 --> 19:31.840]  and it's gonna tear into it really hard.
[19:31.840 --> 19:33.560]  So you wanna use a really fine grit sandpaper
[19:33.560 --> 19:35.320]  is one of the easiest things really to use.
[19:35.320 --> 19:37.400]  I like to just soak those plants, put a little bit
[19:37.400 --> 19:39.440]  a couple drops of hygros on them and a glass of water
[19:39.440 --> 19:40.280]  or a jar of water.
[19:40.280 --> 19:42.880]  Use an enzyme, eat away at the shell a little bit.
[19:42.880 --> 19:44.640]  With those plants soak for about 24 hours
[19:44.640 --> 19:45.680]  and then put them in the paper towel
[19:45.680 --> 19:46.720]  and drink them like normal.
[19:46.720 --> 19:48.000]  Yeah, that usually works for me.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.800]  Another one I use is Dr. Willard's plant catalyst.
[19:50.800 --> 19:52.400]  Okay, that's a good shit.
[19:52.400 --> 19:53.520]  That is a really good product.
[19:53.520 --> 19:55.320]  I've never talked about that on the podcast.
[19:55.320 --> 19:56.800]  They gave me a free bottle of it.
[19:56.800 --> 19:57.960]  The guy gave me a case.
[19:57.960 --> 20:00.360]  30 to 60 mils in your reservoir, he said.
[20:00.360 --> 20:02.200]  And I go, well, how do you know how big my reservoir is?
[20:02.200 --> 20:03.280]  He goes, it doesn't matter what this.
[20:03.280 --> 20:05.400]  You put 30 to 60 mils in here
[20:05.440 --> 20:06.960]  and it'll make your plants go faster.
[20:06.960 --> 20:07.800]  And it did.
[20:07.800 --> 20:09.480]  I could see them absorbing more nutrients.
[20:09.480 --> 20:11.120]  We did a side by side with seeds.
[20:11.120 --> 20:12.080]  We took blueberry fuel.
[20:12.080 --> 20:13.520]  We took about 10 of them, germinated them
[20:13.520 --> 20:14.480]  with regular tap water.
[20:14.480 --> 20:17.880]  And then we germinated out of the same group.
[20:17.880 --> 20:20.040]  Another 10 seeds, Dr. Willard's and tap water,
[20:20.040 --> 20:21.560]  24 hour difference.
[20:21.560 --> 20:22.400]  I was amazed.
[20:22.400 --> 20:24.520]  Every one of those seeds germinated within 24 hours.
[20:24.520 --> 20:25.360]  It was like.
[20:25.360 --> 20:26.200]  It's nice.
[20:26.200 --> 20:27.040]  Crazy.
[20:27.040 --> 20:29.640]  Yeah, and then the regular tap water took about 36 to 48.
[20:29.640 --> 20:30.960]  So it was a dramatic difference.
[20:30.960 --> 20:32.560]  You could see it was like overnight,
[20:32.560 --> 20:33.880]  you know, versus the next day.
[20:33.880 --> 20:35.200]  It was like, it was pretty wild.
[20:36.000 --> 20:36.840]  It was like, that's some good stuff.
[20:36.840 --> 20:37.880]  So we use it religiously.
[20:37.880 --> 20:40.360]  So shout out to Dr. Willard's plant catalyst.
[20:40.360 --> 20:43.280]  If you want to send us stuff, get in touch.
[20:43.280 --> 20:44.920]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[20:44.920 --> 20:46.480]  We'd love to help you out.
[20:46.480 --> 20:47.320]  That'd be cool.
[20:48.400 --> 20:50.080]  All right, so if you leave them in there too long,
[20:50.080 --> 20:51.600]  you guys, your seeds will start splitting.
[20:51.600 --> 20:52.800]  So pay attention.
[20:52.800 --> 20:53.640]  Also check it out.
[20:53.640 --> 20:54.480]  I want to mention this.
[20:54.480 --> 20:55.840]  This is something that comes to mind.
[20:55.840 --> 20:58.700]  If your plants start dropping seeds,
[20:58.700 --> 21:01.000]  if you have more than one female in the room
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.940]  and seeds fall out of your plant,
[21:02.940 --> 21:04.280]  you can't just pick that seed up
[21:04.280 --> 21:06.360]  and assume that it came from this girl.
[21:06.360 --> 21:08.660]  That could have came from any of the females in the room
[21:08.660 --> 21:09.960]  and it could have rolled to that spot.
[21:09.960 --> 21:12.480]  So you can't label that one what you think it fell from.
[21:12.480 --> 21:13.640]  You can only label seeds
[21:13.640 --> 21:15.960]  what you're fucking sure it came from.
[21:15.960 --> 21:17.640]  Don't ever guess when labeling a seed.
[21:17.640 --> 21:20.440]  That is the future of the cannabis genome
[21:20.440 --> 21:21.960]  and we don't want any confusion.
[21:21.960 --> 21:24.080]  It's your job as a person breeding
[21:24.080 --> 21:26.680]  to take beautiful notes for the future.
[21:26.680 --> 21:27.520]  Please do that.
[21:27.520 --> 21:28.920]  For example, I just had a crop
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.920]  and we popped the seed out of it earlier.
[21:31.880 --> 21:33.720]  That goes in the happy accident bag.
[21:34.160 --> 21:35.240]  Yes, happy accidents are a good thing
[21:35.240 --> 21:37.880]  when you're in the seed business or the breeding game.
[21:37.880 --> 21:38.720]  Those don't ever make it out to the public.
[21:38.720 --> 21:41.200]  I have a really, really great idea where it come.
[21:41.200 --> 21:43.520]  I'm almost like 90% sure where it came from
[21:43.520 --> 21:46.840]  but I still label this so and put happy accident.
[21:46.840 --> 21:48.040]  And then I'll pop that seed
[21:48.040 --> 21:51.320]  and it'll get a whole new name and a whole new thing.
[21:51.320 --> 21:53.960]  If it stays around, it could be the next hottest clone only.
[21:53.960 --> 21:55.800]  It could be because a lot of likely
[21:55.800 --> 21:56.760]  it's going to go in the trash.
[21:56.760 --> 21:58.360]  A lot of the super popular shit
[21:58.360 --> 21:59.760]  was an accident just like that.
[21:59.760 --> 22:01.080]  Well, that's what I try to explain people.
[22:01.080 --> 22:02.720]  It's more about selection and not numbers.
[22:02.720 --> 22:03.840]  You can pop a million seeds
[22:03.840 --> 22:05.240]  if you're not good at selecting those plants.
[22:05.240 --> 22:06.960]  What does a million seeds worth?
[22:06.960 --> 22:07.920]  Yeah.
[22:07.920 --> 22:09.640]  Oh man, I found some beautiful keepers
[22:09.640 --> 22:11.000]  that most people would have named.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.800]  I can name 10 of the world's most legendary strange right now
[22:13.800 --> 22:15.760]  that all came from five seeds.
[22:15.760 --> 22:16.600]  Chem dog.
[22:16.600 --> 22:17.800]  Really blue number four.
[22:17.800 --> 22:18.960]  Yep.
[22:18.960 --> 22:20.760]  Girl Scout cookies.
[22:20.760 --> 22:22.240]  Oh, Gainesville green.
[22:22.240 --> 22:23.520]  Okay, nice.
[22:23.520 --> 22:25.600]  I don't know enough about the Florida weed.
[22:25.600 --> 22:27.960]  But yeah, a lot of the most part we had a white.
[22:27.960 --> 22:29.120]  We actually did a whole episode
[22:29.120 --> 22:31.640]  about accidents and clone only accidents.
[22:31.680 --> 22:32.840]  East Coast sour D.
[22:32.840 --> 22:33.920]  Golden goats.
[22:33.920 --> 22:35.120]  West Coast sour D.
[22:36.560 --> 22:38.960]  OG Kush, Bubba Kush.
[22:38.960 --> 22:40.720]  All right, so it's your job as a breeder, you guys.
[22:40.720 --> 22:43.520]  Please be careful to carefully mark everything.
[22:43.520 --> 22:44.720]  Make sure you label everything.
[22:44.720 --> 22:46.160]  Don't make any mistakes for the future
[22:46.160 --> 22:48.560]  because you're going to be growing these seeds
[22:48.560 --> 22:50.200]  and hopefully some of your friends are going to be growing them
[22:50.200 --> 22:52.560]  and you don't want to mislead people on what is in there.
[22:52.560 --> 22:55.120]  A lot of this stuff is going to be aimed at medical patients
[22:55.120 --> 22:56.400]  and we want the medical patients
[22:56.400 --> 22:58.480]  to know the genetics of what they're getting.
[22:58.480 --> 22:59.840]  It's really helpful.
[22:59.840 --> 23:00.680]  Absolutely.
[23:00.680 --> 23:02.960]  If you find some seeds on the floor, you can use them.
[23:02.960 --> 23:04.680]  You just can't, you just got to be careful
[23:04.680 --> 23:06.080]  and carefully think about what they are.
[23:06.080 --> 23:08.520]  Don't try to say it's this times this until you grow it.
[23:08.520 --> 23:10.440]  And if you're certain, then you could be cool with that.
[23:10.440 --> 23:11.520]  That's right.
[23:11.520 --> 23:12.360]  All right, so.
[23:12.360 --> 23:13.920]  If it's an unknown, just label it an unknown.
[23:13.920 --> 23:15.000]  That's not necessarily a bad thing.
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.480]  I've seen some of the biggest, largest breeders
[23:16.480 --> 23:19.480]  in the world label their genetics unknown crossed with this.
[23:19.480 --> 23:21.720]  Yeah, Gage has a special name for those.
[23:21.720 --> 23:23.280]  Yeah, or name it.
[23:23.280 --> 23:26.120]  Yeah, like Gage's number one male, Joseph.
[23:26.120 --> 23:29.040]  That Joseph male that they used for years and years
[23:29.040 --> 23:29.880]  and years and years.
[23:30.320 --> 23:32.360]  It's a bag seed male from somewhere
[23:32.360 --> 23:33.440]  and nobody knows what it was.
[23:33.440 --> 23:35.400]  So they just named it Joseph OG.
[23:35.400 --> 23:37.520]  And they labeled it properly as so.
[23:37.520 --> 23:39.600]  And then everybody knows that or we wouldn't know that.
[23:39.600 --> 23:42.000]  You can actually buy Gage's unlabeled seeds
[23:42.000 --> 23:42.840]  and they've got a name.
[23:42.840 --> 23:45.800]  I don't remember what they're called, but you can buy them.
[23:45.800 --> 23:47.800]  They're all the seeds that fell to the side.
[23:47.800 --> 23:50.640]  They're called good ideas is what his extra seeds are called.
[23:50.640 --> 23:52.320]  He calls them good ideas.
[23:52.320 --> 23:53.160]  Yeah, they're a good idea,
[23:53.160 --> 23:54.920]  but I don't know what it's going to be.
[23:54.920 --> 23:55.760]  Yeah. That's it.
[23:55.760 --> 23:57.880]  All right, so let's get back to our little breeding project
[23:57.880 --> 23:58.720]  here for Fred.
[23:58.720 --> 24:00.240]  We've got plants with seeds in them.
[24:00.240 --> 24:01.080]  They've been pollinated.
[24:01.080 --> 24:04.080]  They've gone five and a half, six ish weeks
[24:04.080 --> 24:05.640]  since the pollen has hit them.
[24:05.640 --> 24:07.360]  The pistils are curly and brown.
[24:07.360 --> 24:08.920]  The trichomes are starting to amber up.
[24:08.920 --> 24:10.420]  The plants are getting mature.
[24:11.520 --> 24:13.120]  Let's start flushing the plants.
[24:13.120 --> 24:15.600]  And now let's talk about pulling down the plants
[24:15.600 --> 24:17.880]  and getting the seeds out of these sons of bitches.
[24:17.880 --> 24:18.720]  Right on.
[24:18.720 --> 24:20.760]  I harvest them just like I harvest
[24:20.760 --> 24:21.760]  any other regular plant.
[24:21.760 --> 24:24.680]  I take it down, take away any water leaf, anything,
[24:24.680 --> 24:27.360]  basically do a light wet trim.
[24:27.360 --> 24:30.320]  And then I just hang them and let them dry.
[24:30.320 --> 24:33.320]  And after one, I let them dry a little bit longer
[24:33.320 --> 24:35.480]  than normal because they are seeded plants.
[24:35.480 --> 24:37.280]  They have a denser texture to them
[24:37.280 --> 24:39.120]  and they're a lot more dense than regular buds.
[24:39.120 --> 24:39.960]  Yeah.
[24:39.960 --> 24:40.780]  And they're hard as a rock.
[24:40.780 --> 24:43.080]  So you got to really let them dry out a little longer.
[24:43.080 --> 24:45.200]  And then after they're done, you know,
[24:45.200 --> 24:47.160]  you just kind of carefully roll them in your hands.
[24:47.160 --> 24:49.120]  That's what all I do is just carefully roll them in.
[24:49.120 --> 24:51.640]  I just let the seeds fall, not from a high place,
[24:51.640 --> 24:53.360]  but from a low spot.
[24:53.360 --> 24:57.000]  Six inches or lower above your table or sifting tray.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.320]  When you buy a package of ball jars or Kerr jars,
[25:00.320 --> 25:02.480]  little mason jars, it comes with that cardboard base
[25:02.480 --> 25:03.320]  to keep them in place.
[25:03.320 --> 25:05.440]  I love to use that thing or go to the liquor store
[25:05.440 --> 25:07.600]  and get something that they just put cases of beer in,
[25:07.600 --> 25:08.560]  just a little flat one.
[25:08.560 --> 25:10.400]  It's about three or four inches deep
[25:10.400 --> 25:13.280]  and the seeds won't bounce off the cardboard.
[25:13.280 --> 25:14.920]  Sorry, excuse me for clearing the throat so many times.
[25:14.920 --> 25:16.500]  We took so many dabs today.
[25:16.500 --> 25:17.860]  The seeds won't bounce off the cardboard.
[25:17.860 --> 25:20.200]  I used to try to use a cookie sheet or a Pyrex dish,
[25:20.200 --> 25:22.520]  but then you take these buds that are filled with seeds
[25:22.520 --> 25:23.800]  and they're dry and you crumble them up.
[25:23.800 --> 25:25.160]  And if you do it right, you guys,
[25:25.160 --> 25:26.880]  it's going to sound like it's raining.
[25:27.720 --> 25:29.000]  It's going to go to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to,
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.560]  and seeds are going to come raining out of these buds.
[25:31.560 --> 25:34.480]  Use cardboard because they will not bounce as badly
[25:34.480 --> 25:37.800]  as they will out of a cookie sheet or a Pyrex dish.
[25:37.800 --> 25:40.280]  So I usually just, like you said, let the buds dry.
[25:40.280 --> 25:41.520]  Then I roll them up in my hands,
[25:41.520 --> 25:43.040]  crumble them up a little bit.
[25:43.040 --> 25:45.120]  Wear a rubber glove because you're going to get sticky
[25:45.120 --> 25:47.220]  as shit or don't, if you're into that.
[25:47.220 --> 25:49.380]  Some people like to get that resin all over their hands.
[25:49.380 --> 25:51.280]  Our friend Rusty, shout out to Rusty.
[25:51.280 --> 25:52.780]  He likes to pick seeds without gloves
[25:52.780 --> 25:53.920]  and be all dark fingered.
[25:53.920 --> 25:54.760]  That's me.
[25:56.120 --> 25:57.120]  I got shit to do.
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.400]  Yeah, I got, unless I'm playing with cocoa,
[25:59.400 --> 26:00.240]  I'm wearing gloves.
[26:00.240 --> 26:02.080]  I like to play with the cocoa barehanded.
[26:02.080 --> 26:03.720]  That cocoa just cleans your hands.
[26:03.720 --> 26:04.560]  If your hands are filthy,
[26:04.560 --> 26:06.480]  just go stick them in the cocoa and mix them around.
[26:06.480 --> 26:08.080]  Your hands will be shiny again.
[26:08.080 --> 26:09.200]  Shit's rad.
[26:09.200 --> 26:11.640]  All right, so now we've got a bunch of dried bud material,
[26:11.640 --> 26:13.480]  basically, and a bunch of seeds.
[26:13.480 --> 26:15.240]  Depending on the size of your garden,
[26:15.240 --> 26:16.840]  there's a whole bunch of different ways to go
[26:16.840 --> 26:20.340]  and try to pull these seeds out of your buds.
[26:20.340 --> 26:21.520]  I should mention this while we're here
[26:21.520 --> 26:23.960]  because we're all stoned and we might fuck up.
[26:23.960 --> 26:26.520]  Keep your female plants separate at this point.
[26:26.520 --> 26:29.520]  If you're working with more than one varietal,
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.360]  more than one strain of females in this breeding project,
[26:33.360 --> 26:34.600]  keep the bitches separate
[26:34.600 --> 26:37.240]  because you don't wanna get your seeds confused.
[26:37.240 --> 26:39.700]  You wanna have carefully labeled seeds.
[26:39.700 --> 26:41.400]  That's the whole part of why you're breeding
[26:41.400 --> 26:43.340]  is so that you can know what's going on.
[26:43.340 --> 26:44.800]  So keep the girls separated.
[26:44.800 --> 26:47.000]  If you find seeds on the floor in the dry room,
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.040]  once again, those are good ideas.
[26:49.040 --> 26:52.000]  Don't label those unless you're certain of what they are.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.080]  So now we've got all this material.
[26:53.080 --> 26:54.320]  If you've got a little crop,
[26:54.320 --> 26:56.040]  if your garden is kinda small,
[26:56.040 --> 26:57.880]  you can simply do the old school method
[26:57.880 --> 27:00.620]  where you put the little container at an angle
[27:00.620 --> 27:02.160]  and slide the weed up to the top
[27:02.160 --> 27:03.360]  and the seeds will roll to the bottom
[27:03.360 --> 27:05.200]  and the dried weed material will stay at the top.
[27:05.200 --> 27:07.400]  You just get you a good tray, a good magazine,
[27:07.400 --> 27:10.000]  whatever floats your boat, 45 degree angle,
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.440]  a pack of rolling papers.
[27:11.440 --> 27:13.640]  Put on some music and just go at it.
[27:13.640 --> 27:15.560]  Put all those seeds in a jar and let it go.
[27:15.560 --> 27:18.080]  That's the cheapest, easiest way to do it.
[27:18.080 --> 27:19.880]  But if you're doing it on a level
[27:19.880 --> 27:21.640]  to where you've got a seed company,
[27:21.640 --> 27:23.480]  that's gonna get tedious really quickly.
[27:23.480 --> 27:25.800]  You and your friends can only sit around for so long
[27:25.800 --> 27:27.560]  and you're gonna have to give away so many packs of seeds
[27:27.560 --> 27:30.400]  to everyone that helps you for breaking their back.
[27:30.400 --> 27:35.320]  So they do sell, my good friends at Mile High Seed Company,
[27:35.320 --> 27:36.480]  shout out to the Mile High Seed Company,
[27:36.480 --> 27:37.360]  they showed me a device,
[27:37.360 --> 27:39.600]  it's actually a bird seed separator.
[27:39.600 --> 27:40.440]  That thing is sweet.
[27:40.440 --> 27:41.720]  You pour all your material.
[27:41.720 --> 27:43.080]  Yeah, you pour your material into the top
[27:43.080 --> 27:44.680]  and it's got a little hand crank on it
[27:44.680 --> 27:46.240]  and it just spits seeds out one side
[27:46.240 --> 27:48.020]  and all the other material falls right out of the bottom.
[27:48.960 --> 27:51.180]  You can actually buy a fully automatic one nowadays
[27:51.180 --> 27:53.260]  that actually separates everything for you and everything.
[27:53.260 --> 27:57.060]  It likes to separate your trim and everything from your seed
[27:57.060 --> 27:59.140]  so you'll have it in one pile, it has a nice column
[27:59.140 --> 28:01.460]  and then it'll have a clear container below it
[28:01.460 --> 28:02.980]  that actually sucks the seeds in too.
[28:02.980 --> 28:03.900]  You can get them on eBay,
[28:03.900 --> 28:06.020]  just look up Parrot Seed Cleaning Machine.
[28:06.860 --> 28:07.820]  How much are they?
[28:07.820 --> 28:10.540]  They run, your price point's gonna be about $159
[28:10.540 --> 28:11.700]  to like 200 bucks.
[28:11.700 --> 28:12.940]  Fred, buy one, it's worth it.
[28:12.940 --> 28:15.220]  Just the time that you, it's like trimming.
[28:15.220 --> 28:16.060]  It's instant.
[28:16.060 --> 28:18.540]  Trimming is fun the first seven times
[28:18.540 --> 28:20.460]  but after, once you've trimmed 10 times,
[28:20.460 --> 28:22.740]  you wanna put the scissors in your eye.
[28:22.740 --> 28:24.460]  Basically the concept was,
[28:24.460 --> 28:26.300]  I was actually a zoologist for two years,
[28:26.300 --> 28:28.220]  that's how I knew about them.
[28:28.220 --> 28:30.340]  Basically what it is is parrots and birds,
[28:30.340 --> 28:33.900]  whenever you rear birds in an aviary,
[28:33.900 --> 28:36.660]  they waste about 75 to 80% of the food.
[28:36.660 --> 28:38.300]  They're really picky eaters.
[28:38.300 --> 28:39.580]  So they kinda go through the food
[28:39.580 --> 28:40.980]  and sit through what they want at the time
[28:40.980 --> 28:42.860]  and throw the rest on the ground.
[28:42.860 --> 28:44.900]  So basically you take all your bird feed
[28:44.900 --> 28:47.100]  that you buy in the store that's quite expensive
[28:47.100 --> 28:48.700]  for these parrots and stuff like that
[28:48.700 --> 28:50.300]  and you run it through the machine
[28:50.300 --> 28:52.740]  and you get like 70% return back
[28:52.740 --> 28:54.420]  and you just keep recycling until it's all gone.
[28:54.420 --> 28:55.540]  Birds are dicks.
[28:55.540 --> 28:57.780]  Birds are pains in the ass.
[28:57.780 --> 28:59.200]  Dirty little bastards.
[29:00.340 --> 29:02.540]  All right, so now, oh God, excuse me guys,
[29:02.540 --> 29:04.060]  I apologize for that.
[29:04.060 --> 29:05.220]  I'm gonna blame that on this hitman
[29:05.220 --> 29:07.220]  or the mothership rig that Will brought over.
[29:07.220 --> 29:08.900]  Thanks for bringing over the mothership, that was rad.
[29:08.900 --> 29:11.780]  Oh, and shout out to this distillate.
[29:11.780 --> 29:13.340]  I'm not sure if we could talk about too much
[29:13.340 --> 29:14.740]  where this distillate came from
[29:15.580 --> 29:16.420]  but I've got a friend out there named Frosty
[29:16.420 --> 29:18.460]  who I owe a huge shout out to.
[29:18.460 --> 29:19.300]  Yeah.
[29:19.300 --> 29:21.820]  If you guys wanna link those two together, you can
[29:21.820 --> 29:24.380]  but I don't know if they're related.
[29:24.380 --> 29:25.420]  All right, we've got a bunch of seeds.
[29:25.420 --> 29:26.580]  We've got a bunch of material.
[29:26.580 --> 29:29.540]  We've pulled, we put our seeds into the little bird feeder.
[29:29.540 --> 29:30.820]  We put all our stuff into the bird feeder.
[29:30.820 --> 29:32.860]  We pulled the seeds and the material out.
[29:33.740 --> 29:35.060]  You can smoke that material
[29:35.060 --> 29:37.220]  or you can make hash out of that material
[29:37.220 --> 29:40.040]  or you can make edibles out of that material.
[29:40.040 --> 29:42.060]  There's so many uses for that material, you guys.
[29:42.060 --> 29:43.540]  It is still good quality product.
[29:43.540 --> 29:45.060]  You can roll joints out of it and smoke it.
[29:45.060 --> 29:47.300]  I like to give it to my friend Will
[29:47.300 --> 29:49.980]  and let him make BHO out of it for me.
[29:49.980 --> 29:52.220]  It works really well, yeah.
[29:52.220 --> 29:54.640]  The high from it, like I said earlier, is amazing.
[29:54.640 --> 29:57.640]  You can also make oil out of it, make edibles out of it.
[29:57.640 --> 29:58.900]  You can make butter out of it.
[29:58.900 --> 30:00.020]  You can do anything that you would do
[30:00.020 --> 30:02.340]  with any other buds out of that material.
[30:02.340 --> 30:05.860]  So seeds, there is controversy online.
[30:05.860 --> 30:07.980]  Do seeds need to cure?
[30:07.980 --> 30:11.340]  I believe they do and it also all depends on,
[30:11.340 --> 30:13.380]  that's not where I feel the controversy comes from
[30:14.220 --> 30:16.260]  but it's climate, it's climatic.
[30:16.260 --> 30:19.100]  Yeah, it's where the controversy comes from.
[30:19.100 --> 30:21.300]  Coming from the deep swamp in the Florida,
[30:21.300 --> 30:23.460]  the 100% humidity, 106 degree days
[30:23.460 --> 30:25.700]  every single day of the week is wet.
[30:25.700 --> 30:26.980]  The air is like soup.
[30:26.980 --> 30:28.900]  You have to cure seeds for like three or four weeks
[30:28.900 --> 30:29.720]  to get them to germinate.
[30:29.720 --> 30:31.180]  He said the air is like soup.
[30:31.180 --> 30:33.380]  It is like that in the South, it's bad.
[30:33.380 --> 30:35.620]  I've been to some festivals down South and it killed me.
[30:35.620 --> 30:36.460]  It does, it's terrible.
[30:36.460 --> 30:39.700]  I was walking, I was at a festival just walking
[30:39.700 --> 30:41.420]  and I was covered in sweat and I thought I was okay
[30:41.420 --> 30:42.500]  but I looked around at my friends, I was like,
[30:42.500 --> 30:44.020]  you know what, fuck it, I'm sitting down
[30:44.020 --> 30:44.940]  and I was like, you okay?
[30:44.940 --> 30:47.140]  And I was like, I'm cool but I'm too fucking hot.
[30:47.140 --> 30:48.500]  I'm going to sit down right now.
[30:48.500 --> 30:49.340]  Exactly.
[30:49.340 --> 30:51.060]  And I just needed a minute just to not be
[30:51.060 --> 30:52.620]  so damn hot for a minute.
[30:52.620 --> 30:53.940]  Yeah, that's it, that's it.
[30:53.940 --> 30:57.200]  It's real muggy and that's a lot of the humidity
[30:57.200 --> 30:58.040]  and things like that.
[30:58.040 --> 31:00.180]  The higher the humidity,
[31:00.180 --> 31:02.340]  the longer you'll have to cure your seeds.
[31:03.340 --> 31:04.780]  One of the best tricks I've learned
[31:04.780 --> 31:06.020]  since I moved over here to Colorado,
[31:06.020 --> 31:07.580]  it takes about three or four days to cure.
[31:07.580 --> 31:08.420]  Yeah.
[31:08.540 --> 31:12.660]  I back a four bulb, two foot long T5 fixture.
[31:12.660 --> 31:13.500]  Okay.
[31:13.500 --> 31:15.700]  And I back it off about two to three feet off a pan
[31:15.700 --> 31:18.420]  and I let the UVD and all the UV rays and everything
[31:18.420 --> 31:19.940]  cure the seeds in about three days
[31:19.940 --> 31:21.660]  and I swear they jump right out of the seed.
[31:21.660 --> 31:22.500]  Okay.
[31:22.500 --> 31:23.320]  Just the seeds just laid out.
[31:23.320 --> 31:24.740]  Yeah, as soon as it hits water,
[31:24.740 --> 31:26.460]  I mean, they want to fly right out
[31:26.460 --> 31:29.620]  and then all of our testers came back 100% germination.
[31:29.620 --> 31:30.460]  Very cool.
[31:30.460 --> 31:31.820]  I mean, hundreds and hundreds of seeds.
[31:31.820 --> 31:32.660]  Nice.
[31:32.660 --> 31:34.500]  I mean, it was just like, that was a good thing
[31:34.500 --> 31:36.340]  and there's also a few dry ice methods.
[31:36.340 --> 31:39.180]  Are you looking for any testers?
[31:39.180 --> 31:41.020]  Always, always looking for good testers
[31:41.020 --> 31:43.820]  as willing to put in the effort and throw back the result.
[31:43.820 --> 31:46.460]  That's what we're always looking for.
[31:48.220 --> 31:49.860]  A lot of people hit me up to be a tester.
[31:49.860 --> 31:50.940]  I'm sure people hit you up.
[31:50.940 --> 31:53.340]  Let's just give these guys an idea
[31:53.340 --> 31:55.140]  of who is a qualified tester
[31:55.140 --> 31:56.900]  so that we don't have to keep typing these emails.
[31:56.900 --> 31:57.740]  That's right.
[31:57.740 --> 31:59.780]  Well, I'm looking for at least minimum
[31:59.780 --> 32:01.480]  three to five years experience.
[32:02.540 --> 32:04.260]  I want you to pretty much have already run
[32:04.260 --> 32:05.980]  through every book there is on the planet
[32:06.620 --> 32:08.020]  so that you can get your hands on the resource material
[32:08.020 --> 32:09.340]  that's out there because you're given
[32:09.340 --> 32:11.380]  all this free resource material nowadays,
[32:11.380 --> 32:13.340]  especially with the internet and things like that,
[32:13.340 --> 32:15.940]  that there's no really excuse for you
[32:15.940 --> 32:17.780]  not to educate yourself.
[32:17.780 --> 32:19.800]  You have it right in front of your face
[32:19.800 --> 32:20.860]  to educate yourself.
[32:20.860 --> 32:23.580]  That's the first, number one thing I can tell any growers,
[32:23.580 --> 32:25.740]  educate yourself and that's going to make you a better grower.
[32:25.740 --> 32:28.020]  Everybody always, what can I do to make my plants better?
[32:28.020 --> 32:29.260]  What can I do to learn this?
[32:29.260 --> 32:30.100]  Educate yourself.
[32:30.100 --> 32:31.060]  That's the best thing you can do.
[32:31.060 --> 32:31.880]  Yeah.
[32:31.880 --> 32:33.220]  Nobody's going to do it for you.
[32:33.220 --> 32:34.260]  This is the real world.
[32:34.260 --> 32:35.420]  It's just the way it is.
[32:35.860 --> 32:37.700]  It sucks, but it'll make you better.
[32:37.700 --> 32:39.140]  And you know, that's just the way
[32:39.140 --> 32:41.220]  none of us learned the easy way.
[32:41.220 --> 32:42.740]  You know, no one held our hand through it
[32:42.740 --> 32:43.580]  or anything like that.
[32:43.580 --> 32:44.980]  Truth, not at all.
[32:44.980 --> 32:47.140]  You know, that's just the way you have to do it.
[32:47.140 --> 32:49.220]  And then from there, you know, just did,
[32:49.220 --> 32:52.060]  we're looking for, we're looking for people
[32:52.060 --> 32:53.340]  that are, you know, headstrong,
[32:53.340 --> 32:55.860]  that are internet, slightly internet savvy,
[32:55.860 --> 32:57.980]  you know, that can type a complete sentence.
[32:57.980 --> 32:58.820]  That's right.
[32:58.820 --> 32:59.980]  If you can't type a complete sentence,
[32:59.980 --> 33:01.940]  you're automatically disqualified.
[33:02.340 --> 33:06.900]  Um, you know, if you say bae, you're disqualified.
[33:06.900 --> 33:10.780]  I'll agree with that.
[33:10.780 --> 33:11.740]  Yeah.
[33:11.740 --> 33:13.980]  At least one or two lights that you can fully dedicate
[33:13.980 --> 33:15.740]  to the seeds that I'm going to send you.
[33:15.740 --> 33:18.360]  At least, at least one light for the 10 pack of seeds
[33:18.360 --> 33:19.300]  that you're going to get for free.
[33:19.300 --> 33:21.420]  I want one light of your space.
[33:21.420 --> 33:23.620]  I want you to be able to make a diary
[33:23.620 --> 33:25.500]  of what your, of what, how your grow went.
[33:25.500 --> 33:27.420]  How many of the seeds I sent you germinated?
[33:27.420 --> 33:28.680]  How many of them were females?
[33:28.680 --> 33:30.540]  How many were hermaphrodites?
[33:30.700 --> 33:33.780]  How long did it take to see sex?
[33:33.780 --> 33:36.280]  How long did it take you to find the hermaphrodite?
[33:36.280 --> 33:38.420]  How many of those plants were male and female?
[33:38.420 --> 33:40.780]  Out of those females, how many were keepers?
[33:40.780 --> 33:42.420]  How many would you run again?
[33:42.420 --> 33:44.220]  Would you run this strain again?
[33:44.220 --> 33:46.380]  Do you have the ability to get this plant tested
[33:46.380 --> 33:51.380]  for THC, CBD, THC, THCA, THCV, CBG?
[33:52.660 --> 33:54.620]  Do you have testing capabilities?
[33:54.620 --> 33:57.100]  Do you have terpene testing abilities?
[33:57.100 --> 33:58.140]  How was the flavor?
[33:58.140 --> 33:59.860]  How was the high?
[33:59.860 --> 34:01.420]  Was it worth a shit at all?
[34:01.420 --> 34:02.940]  How long did it take to flower?
[34:02.940 --> 34:04.580]  We want that kind of notes.
[34:04.580 --> 34:06.420]  And then we want you to get a camera.
[34:06.420 --> 34:07.840]  If it's your iPhone, that's rad.
[34:07.840 --> 34:08.980]  If you've got a better camera,
[34:08.980 --> 34:10.580]  we want you to get a good camera.
[34:10.580 --> 34:12.840]  And I want pictures at least once a week
[34:12.840 --> 34:15.140]  of each phenotype carefully labeled
[34:15.140 --> 34:17.700]  with the week number, the strain name,
[34:17.700 --> 34:20.300]  and the phenotype number that you have selected for that.
[34:20.300 --> 34:21.820]  But we can't stand in the industry
[34:21.820 --> 34:24.520]  as the guy that we give 20 seeds to that pops three seeds
[34:24.520 --> 34:26.140]  and it takes six months to get a report back
[34:26.140 --> 34:27.060]  on those three seeds.
[34:27.060 --> 34:28.540]  Yeah, I'm trying to, the reason-
[34:28.540 --> 34:30.740]  I cannot stand that more than anything.
[34:30.740 --> 34:32.580]  If you're that guy, you suck guy.
[34:32.580 --> 34:34.580]  I'm just gonna go ahead and say that.
[34:34.580 --> 34:37.100]  I've been that guy before because our friend,
[34:37.100 --> 34:40.340]  Gage Green Genetics sent me about 7,000 packs of seeds.
[34:40.340 --> 34:41.180]  I agree, I have.
[34:41.180 --> 34:42.260]  And so he's like, have you tested those yet?
[34:42.260 --> 34:43.940]  And I'm like, I only have so many.
[34:43.940 --> 34:45.740]  Yeah, which ones?
[34:45.740 --> 34:47.280]  I can only pull over so far.
[34:47.280 --> 34:48.460]  Yeah, shout out to Gage.
[34:48.460 --> 34:50.780]  Gage really helped myself out in the cannabis industry,
[34:50.780 --> 34:51.740]  helping me get where I am.
[34:51.740 --> 34:53.940]  So shout out to Gage Green.
[34:53.940 --> 34:56.620]  So let's tell them why it's so frustrating.
[34:56.620 --> 34:58.060]  When I send you testers,
[34:58.540 --> 35:00.740]  it's because I'm trying to release a new product line
[35:00.740 --> 35:02.620]  and I wanna get research done on that
[35:02.620 --> 35:04.640]  so that I don't put out seeds that are shit
[35:04.640 --> 35:06.840]  because I don't wanna put them available
[35:06.840 --> 35:10.340]  at thedankteam.com and then you spend money on them
[35:10.340 --> 35:11.700]  and then they totally suck.
[35:11.700 --> 35:13.720]  So I send out to my testing team,
[35:13.720 --> 35:16.540]  I send out quite a large batch of test seeds.
[35:16.540 --> 35:19.740]  I've sent out entire first runs of test batches.
[35:19.740 --> 35:21.520]  Like this first breeding project,
[35:21.520 --> 35:24.980]  I kept like 250 of them and then sent fucking 1,000 seeds
[35:24.980 --> 35:26.160]  out to other people to run.
[35:26.160 --> 35:27.660]  And then if it's worth a shit, I'll make more.
[35:28.300 --> 35:30.020]  And I always find too the easiest way
[35:30.020 --> 35:32.500]  to select the best phenotype out of 1,000 seeds
[35:32.500 --> 35:34.700]  is to have a bunch of really good testers
[35:34.700 --> 35:36.300]  and stay in contact with them
[35:36.300 --> 35:39.180]  and keep up with them and have them keep up with you.
[35:39.180 --> 35:40.900]  And then that way, whenever it comes down to it,
[35:40.900 --> 35:42.380]  and you're like, hey, well, here's something
[35:42.380 --> 35:44.620]  that you don't have for doing all that work,
[35:44.620 --> 35:45.980]  give them a little trade off or something,
[35:45.980 --> 35:47.420]  finding it for you.
[35:47.420 --> 35:48.860]  You find keepers and things like that.
[35:48.860 --> 35:50.980]  You find test results that you don't find other places.
[35:50.980 --> 35:52.260]  That's how I know personally,
[35:52.260 --> 35:54.660]  like a lot of Rust-Ease and Cannavatures cuts
[35:54.660 --> 35:55.700]  and things like that were found.
[35:55.700 --> 35:57.300]  That's how our blueberry fuel was found
[35:57.940 --> 35:58.780]  and we ended up with over 500 seeds.
[35:58.780 --> 36:01.540]  And three years later, it came out of Boston.
[36:01.540 --> 36:03.380]  It ended up out of Boston.
[36:03.380 --> 36:04.700]  It's my boy, William Boston.
[36:04.700 --> 36:07.020]  Yeah, I've got a friend who's doing a really good job
[36:07.020 --> 36:09.020]  with Capleton and I'm waiting for a cut of that.
[36:09.020 --> 36:11.100]  And then I've got a friend who can't be mentioned,
[36:11.100 --> 36:15.060]  who's got a really good cut of the blue healer,
[36:15.060 --> 36:17.420]  which has some little bit of blue dream in there.
[36:17.420 --> 36:18.860]  Hashtag fuck blue dream.
[36:18.860 --> 36:19.700]  Uh-oh.
[36:19.700 --> 36:22.660]  I tried to fix it.
[36:22.660 --> 36:23.500]  You tried to fix it.
[36:23.500 --> 36:25.340]  I was trying to fix the blue dream.
[36:25.340 --> 36:26.180]  I was just trying to fix it.
[36:26.220 --> 36:29.140]  I just added terpenes to it that wasn't presently there.
[36:29.140 --> 36:30.860]  It does really well with OG terps.
[36:30.860 --> 36:32.100]  And that's what we found
[36:32.100 --> 36:35.500]  because it's already got some myrosine present
[36:35.500 --> 36:36.860]  and some other things that you normally
[36:36.860 --> 36:38.660]  don't typically find in sativas,
[36:38.660 --> 36:40.460]  but you can't really taste it in the blue dream.
[36:40.460 --> 36:43.020]  So why not give it that extra kick
[36:43.020 --> 36:45.140]  and add terpenes that aren't normally there
[36:45.140 --> 36:46.980]  in different structures in a shorter flowering time.
[36:46.980 --> 36:49.900]  You get a tangy blue dream cross at work.
[36:49.900 --> 36:50.780]  I bet that's amazing.
[36:50.780 --> 36:51.620]  That's really good.
[36:51.620 --> 36:52.820]  I bet it's got a really nice structure to it.
[36:52.820 --> 36:54.420]  Yeah, real nice structure and heavy yields.
[36:54.420 --> 36:55.340]  That's what you need.
[36:55.460 --> 36:56.300]  That's what you need nowadays.
[36:56.300 --> 36:57.900]  It is a great parent.
[36:57.900 --> 37:00.420]  That's really where it lies at anymore.
[37:00.420 --> 37:01.700]  I don't think it has a place
[37:01.700 --> 37:04.340]  on the top shelf market anymore.
[37:04.340 --> 37:05.540]  But to us breeders,
[37:05.540 --> 37:07.260]  I still think it's still golden to these days
[37:07.260 --> 37:08.580]  because it is so stable.
[37:08.580 --> 37:09.980]  Yeah, I'll give it that.
[37:09.980 --> 37:13.700]  You know, that's why it's close to me.
[37:13.700 --> 37:14.540]  In my heart, this is
[37:14.540 --> 37:15.700]  because it's always been a great breeder.
[37:15.700 --> 37:16.660]  You can hit it with anything.
[37:16.660 --> 37:18.100]  You can hit it with raffinitic genes
[37:18.100 --> 37:20.220]  and it's going to come out great.
[37:20.220 --> 37:23.460]  I've done it and had happy accidents and great ideas.
[37:23.460 --> 37:24.780]  Don't encourage anybody.
[37:25.180 --> 37:26.700]  No, don't do that on purpose.
[37:26.700 --> 37:28.820]  Definitely don't do that on purpose.
[37:28.820 --> 37:30.860]  I'm going to back up in something we didn't talk about.
[37:30.860 --> 37:32.820]  If you're making feminized seeds,
[37:32.820 --> 37:35.740]  you need to get that male going way early,
[37:35.740 --> 37:37.700]  three weeks ahead of time.
[37:37.700 --> 37:39.860]  If you're trying to get your female plants
[37:39.860 --> 37:41.700]  ready to flower at week three,
[37:41.700 --> 37:43.100]  you want to get those males,
[37:43.100 --> 37:46.220]  if you want to start spraying them in veg,
[37:47.300 --> 37:48.460]  spray them in veg for a week
[37:48.460 --> 37:51.460]  and then flower them almost six weeks ahead
[37:51.460 --> 37:52.540]  of those girl plants.
[37:52.540 --> 37:54.940]  You want to get them a nice fat headstart.
[37:54.940 --> 37:56.700]  Reversing a plant takes a lot of time.
[37:56.700 --> 37:58.140]  It takes a lot of energy.
[37:58.140 --> 38:01.020]  You need to stifle the copper movement in the plant
[38:01.020 --> 38:03.300]  by hitting it with the silver thiosulfate.
[38:03.300 --> 38:05.260]  The plant needs to react.
[38:05.260 --> 38:07.220]  It needs to learn what to do with that reaction.
[38:07.220 --> 38:10.660]  It needs to change its hormones to create pollen.
[38:10.660 --> 38:13.700]  Then it needs to develop the sacs to create pollen.
[38:13.700 --> 38:14.940]  Then it will release pollen.
[38:14.940 --> 38:16.620]  It's going to take a long time.
[38:16.620 --> 38:18.860]  If you're making your first reversed male,
[38:18.860 --> 38:20.780]  you're going to be like, I did it wrong.
[38:20.780 --> 38:22.260]  You just got to spray it more.
[38:23.020 --> 38:24.460]  And more and more and more.
[38:24.460 --> 38:26.140]  Don't even waste time with colloidal silver.
[38:26.140 --> 38:27.740]  Make your own silver thiosulfate.
[38:27.740 --> 38:29.580]  That was really going to spray the shit out of it.
[38:29.580 --> 38:31.300]  Since all these new growers are coming on the scene,
[38:31.300 --> 38:33.340]  people are trying to create their new strains and stuff.
[38:33.340 --> 38:35.900]  The colloidal silver hype is coming back stronger than ever.
[38:35.900 --> 38:37.300]  It was around about 10 years ago
[38:37.300 --> 38:38.980]  and now it's back like bell bottoms, man.
[38:38.980 --> 38:39.820]  It's crazy.
[38:39.820 --> 38:42.460]  I'm just like, no, the colloidal silver don't do it.
[38:42.460 --> 38:44.300]  It doesn't block the gene well enough
[38:44.300 --> 38:46.740]  and for long enough and hard enough and strong enough
[38:46.740 --> 38:49.740]  to not create a high ratio of hermaphroditic problems.
[38:49.740 --> 38:50.580]  Don't do it.
[38:50.580 --> 38:51.620]  Use STS.
[38:52.260 --> 38:54.780]  You'll have an, in the long run, it's cheaper.
[38:54.780 --> 38:55.620]  It's cheaper.
[38:55.620 --> 38:56.540]  Oh, it's so much cheaper.
[38:56.540 --> 38:57.620]  I have to throw it away
[38:57.620 --> 38:59.580]  because I make too large of a batch at one time.
[38:59.580 --> 39:00.420]  That's it.
[39:00.420 --> 39:01.900]  Throw tons of it away.
[39:01.900 --> 39:02.980]  And it's dirt cheap.
[39:02.980 --> 39:04.540]  Once you buy your first batch,
[39:04.540 --> 39:06.500]  I've got some from two years ago.
[39:06.500 --> 39:07.340]  That's it.
[39:07.340 --> 39:08.180]  Oh, wow.
[39:08.180 --> 39:09.020]  That's where I'm at too.
[39:09.020 --> 39:10.180]  Yeah, you use, I think you buy a one ounce
[39:10.180 --> 39:11.100]  and a three ounce jar.
[39:11.100 --> 39:13.380]  And I think you use like three grams and two grams
[39:13.380 --> 39:14.860]  out of each jar for your first mix.
[39:14.860 --> 39:15.980]  My jar is this big.
[39:15.980 --> 39:17.060]  Yeah, exactly.
[39:17.060 --> 39:17.900]  It's huge.
[39:17.900 --> 39:18.740]  I mean, just.
[39:18.740 --> 39:20.140]  And you can store that jar for, I've got.
[39:20.140 --> 39:20.980]  It's like 40, 50 bucks.
[39:21.300 --> 39:23.060]  Like we said earlier, it's in the fridge right next door
[39:23.060 --> 39:24.540]  to the pollen that we store.
[39:24.540 --> 39:25.380]  And it's right in there.
[39:25.380 --> 39:26.580]  It doesn't degrade in there
[39:26.580 --> 39:28.260]  as long as moisture doesn't get into it.
[39:28.260 --> 39:30.260]  If you're gonna make silver thiosulfate spray,
[39:30.260 --> 39:31.740]  one way to keep it around longer,
[39:31.740 --> 39:34.780]  when you mix the two components
[39:34.780 --> 39:36.580]  into these separate containers of water,
[39:36.580 --> 39:37.460]  keep them separate.
[39:37.460 --> 39:39.460]  Don't mix them and they'll store longer.
[39:39.460 --> 39:40.300]  Right.
[39:40.300 --> 39:41.140]  Yeah.
[39:41.140 --> 39:42.780]  And I also never spray my STS under light.
[39:42.780 --> 39:43.620]  Right.
[39:43.620 --> 39:45.860]  I always take it out, spray it in darkness
[39:45.860 --> 39:47.140]  until it's just dripping off.
[39:47.140 --> 39:49.220]  I try to get the other sides of the leaves, the stalks.
[39:49.220 --> 39:50.540]  The stalks are important.
[39:51.060 --> 39:51.900]  Yeah, spray the stalks.
[39:51.900 --> 39:52.740]  Yeah.
[39:52.740 --> 39:53.940]  And then let it dry out really good.
[39:53.940 --> 39:55.380]  Maybe even with a little fan beside it,
[39:55.380 --> 39:56.300]  let it dry out real good.
[39:56.300 --> 39:57.300]  Make sure everything's dry.
[39:57.300 --> 39:59.340]  Otherwise you will get burn marks.
[39:59.340 --> 40:00.180]  And then.
[40:00.180 --> 40:01.380]  And if you put it back in a room with some girls
[40:01.380 --> 40:02.420]  that you're not trying to flip,
[40:02.420 --> 40:03.540]  you'll have some trannies in there.
[40:03.540 --> 40:04.380]  That's right.
[40:04.380 --> 40:07.420]  Yeah, you'll make some Caitlyn generoci on accident.
[40:07.420 --> 40:08.620]  That's right, because a little bit of rub here,
[40:08.620 --> 40:09.460]  a little bit of rub there,
[40:09.460 --> 40:11.220]  a little STS here, a little STS there.
[40:11.220 --> 40:12.580]  It happens.
[40:12.580 --> 40:13.580]  You learn from experience.
[40:13.580 --> 40:14.420]  You learn from doing it the wrong way.
[40:14.420 --> 40:16.780]  Some plants are gonna take a whole bunch of spray.
[40:16.780 --> 40:17.780]  Some are not.
[40:17.780 --> 40:18.620]  That's it.
[40:18.620 --> 40:19.540]  And then some are gonna burn from it.
[40:19.540 --> 40:22.140]  And it's okay if the leaves curl up and look pissed off.
[40:22.140 --> 40:23.860]  As long as you still have enough of that plant
[40:23.860 --> 40:25.780]  to create pollen, you're gonna be all right.
[40:25.780 --> 40:27.860]  It's that male plant is gonna look like shit
[40:27.860 --> 40:29.820]  after that silver thiosulfate spray.
[40:29.820 --> 40:31.260]  And that's what people really need to understand too
[40:31.260 --> 40:32.300]  about reversing plants.
[40:32.300 --> 40:34.300]  You're not, I've had somebody come into my grow
[40:34.300 --> 40:35.500]  and say, oh, you have a Hermes plant.
[40:35.500 --> 40:36.540]  And I was like, no, it's a reverse plant.
[40:36.540 --> 40:37.820]  They look at me and go, huh?
[40:37.820 --> 40:38.900]  And they just look at me, you know,
[40:38.900 --> 40:40.700]  with the most baffled look on their face
[40:40.700 --> 40:41.900]  and they don't understand what I'm talking about.
[40:41.900 --> 40:43.100]  Reverse plant is totally different
[40:43.100 --> 40:44.140]  than a hermaphroditic plant.
[40:44.140 --> 40:45.260]  Yeah, we did this on purpose.
[40:45.260 --> 40:47.420]  We did this on purpose and we're blocking genes.
[40:47.420 --> 40:49.940]  We're actually blocking genes in the genome.
[40:49.940 --> 40:53.260]  Whereas hermaphroditic is like that because of its genome.
[40:53.260 --> 40:56.700]  So the silver hits the plant and it can't move by itself.
[40:56.700 --> 40:58.620]  So the thiosulfate solution makes it mobile
[40:58.620 --> 40:59.820]  and absorbable within the plant.
[40:59.820 --> 41:02.220]  And that blocks the copper production in the plant,
[41:02.220 --> 41:04.020]  the copper movement in the plant,
[41:04.020 --> 41:05.780]  which triggers an ethylene response.
[41:05.780 --> 41:07.020]  Is it ethyl or ethylene?
[41:07.900 --> 41:10.980]  Fuck, either way, come on, help me out.
[41:10.980 --> 41:14.260]  It triggers a response of ethyl or ethylene.
[41:14.260 --> 41:15.820]  I'm gonna say ethyl because ethylene sounds
[41:15.820 --> 41:18.500]  like more of a gas, like I'm making meth, right?
[41:18.500 --> 41:19.980]  It sounds like methylamine.
[41:19.980 --> 41:21.180]  You're thinking ethanol.
[41:21.180 --> 41:24.300]  Okay, well, either way, it messes up.
[41:24.300 --> 41:25.220]  It triggers that hormone.
[41:25.220 --> 41:26.820]  And that hormone is what tells the plant
[41:26.820 --> 41:29.300]  that it wants to change sexes and start producing pollen.
[41:29.300 --> 41:30.660]  So then you make pollen that,
[41:30.660 --> 41:32.900]  since this plant has no male chromosomes,
[41:32.900 --> 41:35.080]  it will not donate any male chromosomes
[41:35.080 --> 41:36.020]  to the breeding project.
[41:36.020 --> 41:37.940]  It'll all be female chromosomes.
[41:37.940 --> 41:39.460]  So basically it's gonna take it back
[41:39.460 --> 41:41.140]  and process its traits to its mother.
[41:41.140 --> 41:41.980]  Yeah, that's it.
[41:41.980 --> 41:43.380]  That's the mother of the plant.
[41:43.380 --> 41:45.180]  That's pretty much what it is.
[41:45.180 --> 41:47.420]  If you have a 50-50 hybrid,
[41:47.420 --> 41:48.900]  that's what you can expect it to lean
[41:48.900 --> 41:50.340]  toward that mother side.
[41:50.340 --> 41:54.660]  And then it's ideal once you find the keeper,
[41:54.660 --> 41:56.620]  and I didn't realize not a lot of people
[41:56.620 --> 41:57.940]  were doing this when I started breeding.
[41:57.940 --> 42:00.420]  I was reversing a female to a male
[42:00.420 --> 42:01.940]  and hitting several females.
[42:01.940 --> 42:05.640]  So I was making nine or 10 feminized crosses at one time.
[42:05.640 --> 42:08.300]  And then I realized later that that's not industry standard
[42:08.300 --> 42:09.620]  of how that's done.
[42:09.620 --> 42:12.620]  Most of the time people will take a clone only
[42:12.620 --> 42:14.380]  or their favorite plant and reverse that
[42:14.380 --> 42:17.940]  and hit that pollen on a bunch of the same clones
[42:17.940 --> 42:19.540]  and just keep doing it.
[42:19.540 --> 42:22.260]  I've actually been reversing plants
[42:22.260 --> 42:24.540]  and true breeding with those reversed plants.
[42:24.540 --> 42:27.020]  And I didn't even realize how far out
[42:27.020 --> 42:28.740]  of the norm I was stepping.
[42:28.740 --> 42:30.460]  Most folks would find a keeper
[42:30.460 --> 42:31.860]  and then keep reversing that one
[42:31.860 --> 42:34.140]  to keep making more and more and more.
[42:34.140 --> 42:37.200]  But I've actually, I reversed a plant,
[42:37.200 --> 42:40.500]  pollinated another plant of the clone of the same strain,
[42:40.500 --> 42:42.820]  made seedlings of that, took seeds of that,
[42:42.820 --> 42:44.300]  took that original plant I reversed
[42:44.300 --> 42:45.860]  and hit the pollen on that one.
[42:45.860 --> 42:49.380]  And after a few finial generations of inbreeding,
[42:49.380 --> 42:52.500]  I was unable to reverse the plant with silver thiosulfate.
[42:52.500 --> 42:55.660]  I bred it so strong that it's so female,
[42:55.660 --> 42:57.740]  it will not reverse on me.
[42:57.740 --> 43:00.700]  It was a Grateful Dog experiment
[43:00.700 --> 43:03.800]  and I called it GD77 is the one that will not reverse.
[43:05.460 --> 43:08.420]  1977 is my favorite year of the Grateful Ted
[43:08.420 --> 43:11.020]  is why it got GD77.
[43:11.060 --> 43:13.060]  Random breeder shit right there.
[43:13.060 --> 43:14.420]  It's being the breeder.
[43:14.420 --> 43:15.660]  Yeah, right.
[43:15.660 --> 43:17.260]  I have another rant I wanna kinda go on,
[43:17.260 --> 43:18.980]  but I don't know, it might piss people off.
[43:18.980 --> 43:21.260]  It frustrates me when hashmakers
[43:21.260 --> 43:23.180]  put two different strains in a tube
[43:23.180 --> 43:25.220]  and run it together and think that they can now call it.
[43:25.220 --> 43:27.540]  They call it cross of the, yeah.
[43:27.540 --> 43:29.300]  I'm like, no, that took you seven minutes.
[43:29.300 --> 43:31.220]  Like it takes me fucking years to develop something
[43:31.220 --> 43:32.040]  that I get to name.
[43:32.040 --> 43:33.620]  You don't get to name it.
[43:33.620 --> 43:36.140]  You don't get to name something who expressed
[43:36.140 --> 43:38.940]  because you put Dr. Who and Pineapple Express
[43:38.940 --> 43:40.420]  in a fucking container together.
[43:40.420 --> 43:43.700]  I'm half serious, I'm half frustrated, half don't care.
[43:43.700 --> 43:45.900]  I think it's misleading to the industry.
[43:45.900 --> 43:48.060]  It's misleading to the medical patients.
[43:48.060 --> 43:49.300]  Because it's hard for them to know what strain.
[43:49.300 --> 43:50.140]  Yeah, now I'm like.
[43:50.140 --> 43:51.100]  You have to ask the bud tender.
[43:51.100 --> 43:51.940]  I know.
[43:51.940 --> 43:53.420]  I know that this is Dr. Who
[43:53.420 --> 43:54.900]  and probably Pineapple Express
[43:54.900 --> 43:56.000]  because I've been in this long enough,
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.460]  but it's called Who Express.
[43:58.740 --> 44:00.500]  If you're a medical patient and you're not hip
[44:00.500 --> 44:01.820]  and paying attention on Instagram,
[44:01.820 --> 44:03.340]  you don't know what the fuck that is.
[44:03.340 --> 44:04.800]  And maybe Dr. Who is your favorite,
[44:04.800 --> 44:07.220]  but maybe Pineapple Express gives you panic attacks.
[44:07.220 --> 44:12.220]  That could be OG and Tangy for all you know.
[44:12.260 --> 44:14.020]  They could name it whatever they want.
[44:14.020 --> 44:16.060]  Could be a handful of Who and the rest Express.
[44:16.060 --> 44:16.900]  And I understand.
[44:16.900 --> 44:17.980]  You don't know.
[44:17.980 --> 44:18.820]  You just don't know.
[44:18.820 --> 44:20.380]  Is it really 50-50 bland?
[44:20.380 --> 44:22.740]  Or is it why they don't even label it so?
[44:22.740 --> 44:24.420]  Right, and I'm not trying to be a hater on that.
[44:24.420 --> 44:26.060]  I just think that that's a little bit misleading.
[44:26.060 --> 44:26.900]  I understand that the-
[44:26.900 --> 44:27.860]  No, we've come to the point in technology
[44:27.860 --> 44:28.940]  in this cannabis industry
[44:28.940 --> 44:30.380]  where we're supposed to be stepping it up here
[44:30.380 --> 44:32.100]  in Colorado and everything else.
[44:32.100 --> 44:34.100]  We're the guys that are,
[44:34.100 --> 44:36.340]  these guys sitting at this table right now,
[44:36.340 --> 44:38.020]  among other growers here in Colorado
[44:38.020 --> 44:39.980]  are the ones that are sitting in the forefront
[44:39.980 --> 44:40.820]  for all the other states
[44:40.820 --> 44:42.660]  because they're all looking at this state going,
[44:42.660 --> 44:44.060]  how do we do this?
[44:44.060 --> 44:45.300]  And they're following in line.
[44:45.300 --> 44:46.820]  We're following our models.
[44:46.820 --> 44:47.640]  That's it.
[44:47.640 --> 44:48.480]  We're taking the lead.
[44:48.480 --> 44:51.020]  And it started ever since I've been in Colorado
[44:51.020 --> 44:53.380]  and we're proud to be a part of that.
[44:53.380 --> 44:57.740]  This particular company will only accept 1,000 gram runs.
[44:57.740 --> 44:59.440]  So I understand the need to mix shit
[44:59.440 --> 45:02.380]  because if you've got a pound of this and a pound of this,
[45:02.380 --> 45:04.500]  then you got a 1,000 gram run.
[45:04.500 --> 45:05.340]  A lot of shrimp.
[45:05.700 --> 45:07.220]  Yeah, a lot of shrimp, exactly.
[45:07.220 --> 45:08.980]  And they make a great product.
[45:08.980 --> 45:10.060]  I'm not gonna say their name or anything
[45:10.060 --> 45:11.020]  because I kind of just talk shit,
[45:11.020 --> 45:13.060]  but they do make a great product.
[45:13.060 --> 45:14.100]  I just find it frustrating
[45:14.100 --> 45:16.540]  and misleading almost to the market.
[45:16.540 --> 45:18.020]  Well, no, I mean, you're not really talking to,
[45:18.020 --> 45:21.540]  you're just giving them constructive criticism.
[45:21.540 --> 45:22.380]  That's all that is.
[45:22.380 --> 45:24.220]  I mean, if they can't label it,
[45:24.220 --> 45:25.660]  they should label it as so.
[45:25.660 --> 45:28.300]  I mean, then that makes them that much better.
[45:28.300 --> 45:29.140]  Exactly.
[45:30.780 --> 45:32.060]  No disrespect to the people
[45:32.060 --> 45:33.900]  that are forced to combine batches
[45:33.940 --> 45:36.260]  because metric makes you do certain shit.
[45:36.260 --> 45:41.140]  I get it, but I just wish it didn't have to be that way
[45:41.140 --> 45:42.260]  because as a breeder,
[45:42.260 --> 45:44.660]  I get to take Grateful Dog and Girl Scout cookies
[45:44.660 --> 45:47.340]  and put it together and call it doggy style.
[45:47.340 --> 45:49.820]  If two people do that to hash,
[45:49.820 --> 45:50.860]  I don't feel like, I don't know,
[45:50.860 --> 45:53.780]  they just grabbed two tubes and mixed my trim together
[45:53.780 --> 45:55.500]  and now they just made a new strain.
[45:55.500 --> 45:57.700]  And now I can't use the name that they just took
[45:57.700 --> 45:58.540]  because now everyone's back.
[45:58.540 --> 45:59.380]  Exactly what you mean.
[45:59.380 --> 46:00.660]  That's why this one right here, you see,
[46:00.660 --> 46:03.260]  I just call it the people that did it blend.
[46:03.540 --> 46:05.540]  Nice, that is really cool.
[46:05.540 --> 46:06.380]  I like that.
[46:06.380 --> 46:07.220]  I like how you labeled that.
[46:07.220 --> 46:09.100]  I wish I could say their names out loud right now.
[46:09.100 --> 46:10.980]  Probably could, but I don't know.
[46:10.980 --> 46:12.220]  Cool folks.
[46:12.220 --> 46:13.060]  Good people.
[46:13.060 --> 46:15.780]  I wish they were still sitting at this table right now.
[46:15.780 --> 46:16.980]  All right, so we've gotten to the point
[46:16.980 --> 46:19.180]  where we're pulling seeds out of the bud.
[46:19.180 --> 46:20.540]  We're curing buds, that's where we are.
[46:20.540 --> 46:21.740]  I try to keep tabs on where we are.
[46:21.740 --> 46:23.460]  I don't even have any notebook paper
[46:23.460 --> 46:24.700]  and I can still do a podcast.
[46:24.700 --> 46:26.100]  I'm kind of proud of myself.
[46:28.820 --> 46:29.820]  All right, we got to cure them.
[46:29.820 --> 46:31.300]  You say that here in Colorado,
[46:31.820 --> 46:33.340]  I only got to cure them for like three or four days.
[46:33.340 --> 46:34.180]  I agree with that.
[46:34.180 --> 46:36.540]  I didn't realize that in the swamp in the South
[46:36.540 --> 46:38.780]  that you had fucking soup for air.
[46:38.780 --> 46:40.300]  So that makes a lot more sense to me
[46:40.300 --> 46:42.940]  than to people that have argued that they need some cure time.
[46:42.940 --> 46:45.740]  My theory was that the seeds finish in the buds,
[46:45.740 --> 46:47.460]  in nature, the seeds would finish in the buds,
[46:47.460 --> 46:49.460]  the buds would kind of dry up and die
[46:49.460 --> 46:50.580]  and they would fall into the ground
[46:50.580 --> 46:52.300]  and they would sit in the ground all winter
[46:52.300 --> 46:54.500]  and that would be their natural cure time,
[46:54.500 --> 46:56.900]  which is part of why I keep my seeds in a cooler
[46:56.900 --> 46:58.780]  because I think that nature would keep them
[46:58.780 --> 47:01.540]  in the snow maybe, depending on where they are,
[47:01.540 --> 47:03.140]  maybe cold rain,
[47:03.140 --> 47:04.740]  and then that's what's also going to germinate them.
[47:04.740 --> 47:06.140]  The rains are going to come and germinate them
[47:06.140 --> 47:08.260]  in the spring and then they're going to start popping up.
[47:08.260 --> 47:11.060]  So I just figured that they would kind of be curing
[47:11.060 --> 47:12.940]  in the plant in nature.
[47:12.940 --> 47:16.620]  Yeah, they've actually been domesticated to the point now
[47:16.620 --> 47:17.580]  where there's only like,
[47:17.580 --> 47:19.900]  there's only certain regions of the world,
[47:19.900 --> 47:21.380]  there's like a handful of places in the world
[47:21.380 --> 47:23.060]  that weed actually grows just completely naturally,
[47:23.060 --> 47:24.700]  like actual weed, not hemp,
[47:25.700 --> 47:27.700]  actual cannabis that it grows naturally,
[47:28.500 --> 47:30.460]  you know, West Himalayan mountains, places like that.
[47:30.460 --> 47:32.500]  I'd love to go up there where I've seen Arjen
[47:32.500 --> 47:34.900]  and his crew go up and smoke some of that outdoor weed.
[47:34.900 --> 47:37.980]  Africa, yeah, Africa is full of a lot of old,
[47:37.980 --> 47:39.580]  like Malawi and places like that.
[47:39.580 --> 47:41.980]  They're just full of old land-raised genetics
[47:41.980 --> 47:44.260]  that are falling and dying and the same crops coming over
[47:44.260 --> 47:46.500]  and over and over again every year in the same spot.
[47:46.500 --> 47:47.740]  Those are heirloom genetics.
[47:47.740 --> 47:49.060]  We're going to keep talking about seeds,
[47:49.060 --> 47:51.860]  but I've got another random note that I want to interrupt
[47:51.860 --> 47:53.100]  because I've got some great people here
[47:53.100 --> 47:55.420]  that are great to have cannabis conversation with.
[47:55.460 --> 47:58.300]  Have you guys seen Arjen from Greenhouse Seeds?
[47:58.300 --> 48:01.220]  Arjen and Franco and Simon travel all around the world
[48:01.220 --> 48:02.500]  and they go to these places
[48:02.500 --> 48:04.500]  where they're growing land-raised genetics
[48:04.500 --> 48:06.740]  and they check it out and they ask the farmers for seeds
[48:06.740 --> 48:09.260]  and the farmers happily will give them a bag of seeds.
[48:09.260 --> 48:10.100]  Here's seeds, here you go.
[48:10.100 --> 48:11.780]  I've seen those, I've seen quite a few of them.
[48:11.780 --> 48:14.500]  Arjen then in return hands them packs
[48:14.500 --> 48:16.300]  of his colored greenhouse seeds
[48:16.300 --> 48:18.840]  because his seeds are rolled in colored coating
[48:18.840 --> 48:20.820]  because then he can tell what strain they are
[48:20.820 --> 48:22.420]  without having them in packaging.
[48:22.420 --> 48:24.360]  Yeah, they're rolled in some candy coating
[48:24.360 --> 48:26.440]  that also works as a fertilizer
[48:26.440 --> 48:28.120]  and helps your plants germinate.
[48:28.120 --> 48:32.040]  So he trades them these oftentimes feminized seeds.
[48:32.940 --> 48:36.040]  Do you guys feel that he is fucking up
[48:36.040 --> 48:37.880]  the land-raised genetics in these places
[48:37.880 --> 48:40.840]  by adulterating them with his seeds?
[48:40.840 --> 48:43.260]  I guess if they're planting them right out there
[48:43.260 --> 48:45.440]  with their land-raises and they're cross-pollinating
[48:45.440 --> 48:48.440]  and they just keep dying and regrowing
[48:48.440 --> 48:51.360]  and then eventually I guess it's going to be a different.
[48:51.360 --> 48:52.200]  Yeah, it does.
[48:52.200 --> 48:54.120]  It does fuck up the heirloom line,
[48:54.880 --> 48:56.360]  but at the same time I've seen a lot
[48:56.360 --> 48:58.120]  of those heirloom genetics and stuff like that
[48:58.120 --> 48:59.600]  and nothing to really brag home about.
[48:59.600 --> 49:00.680]  They look great on paper,
[49:00.680 --> 49:02.520]  but they look like some straight swag
[49:02.520 --> 49:04.900]  and they're finished dry and there's really nothing to them.
[49:04.900 --> 49:07.120]  So the hindsight is 50-50.
[49:07.120 --> 49:10.120]  I mean, he's going to bring a better yielding strains
[49:10.120 --> 49:13.080]  to places like Africa and places like that.
[49:13.080 --> 49:14.560]  But it was in Jamaica.
[49:14.560 --> 49:15.800]  We're actually saw him do this.
[49:15.800 --> 49:17.920]  Right, yeah, but like you're saying,
[49:19.140 --> 49:22.600]  it does, it's kind of a what cost kind of thing.
[49:22.600 --> 49:23.440]  Right.
[49:23.600 --> 49:26.280]  It's like, yeah, you're going to give them better genetics
[49:26.280 --> 49:29.320]  for their future and their kids and their kids
[49:29.320 --> 49:30.840]  and their kids are going to have better yielding,
[49:30.840 --> 49:32.000]  better plants and stuff like that,
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.640]  which is going to yield more profits for them.
[49:33.640 --> 49:34.960]  So they're going to be able to yield more food
[49:34.960 --> 49:36.680]  for their families and things like that.
[49:36.680 --> 49:39.320]  But at the same time, like you said,
[49:39.320 --> 49:40.160]  you're going to come in and you're going
[49:40.160 --> 49:42.560]  to completely disasterize those heirlooms,
[49:42.560 --> 49:45.720]  which that's thousands of generations of people
[49:45.720 --> 49:46.800]  that have been doing the same thing.
[49:46.800 --> 49:51.000]  It's history, but change is inevitable.
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.240]  All right, I like it.
[49:52.240 --> 49:53.360]  I'm torn on the subject.
[49:54.200 --> 49:56.920]  It is, you have to really kind of look 50, 50 at everything
[49:56.920 --> 49:57.960]  because life is a car better.
[49:57.960 --> 49:59.360]  It's going to have good and bad to it.
[49:59.360 --> 50:00.880]  Like Will said, someone's going to get in there
[50:00.880 --> 50:01.720]  at some point.
[50:01.720 --> 50:03.400]  Something at some point would, as I'm sure,
[50:03.400 --> 50:04.880]  over the thousands of years,
[50:04.880 --> 50:06.920]  there's been another type of cross that got in there
[50:06.920 --> 50:07.880]  on accident somehow.
[50:07.880 --> 50:08.720]  Right, true.
[50:08.720 --> 50:11.400]  It could have been somebody's Mexican weed from Florida
[50:11.400 --> 50:14.200]  or it could be greenhouse seeds, white widow.
[50:14.200 --> 50:17.200]  So I guess greenhouse seeds isn't so bad.
[50:17.200 --> 50:19.080]  You know, when he comes out.
[50:19.080 --> 50:21.560]  All right, we'll give him that much.
[50:21.600 --> 50:23.840]  All right, so now the seeds are cured.
[50:23.840 --> 50:26.440]  We've got a big ass bag or maybe a smaller portion
[50:26.440 --> 50:28.400]  of dried and cured seeds.
[50:29.360 --> 50:30.400]  How do we store them?
[50:32.080 --> 50:34.040]  Again, you can use dried rice.
[50:34.040 --> 50:35.960]  What I like to do is steal silicon packets
[50:35.960 --> 50:38.080]  out of electronics and things and things I get in the mail.
[50:38.080 --> 50:39.120]  Oh, so you keep all those?
[50:39.120 --> 50:41.600]  Yeah, those little silicon packs that you get
[50:41.600 --> 50:44.560]  like when you buy a new computer or your phone.
[50:44.560 --> 50:47.040]  Exactly, exactly.
[50:47.040 --> 50:49.440]  You take those, I collect all those.
[50:49.440 --> 50:50.280]  I save them.
[50:50.320 --> 50:51.480]  In Colorado, it's pretty dry.
[50:51.480 --> 50:53.080]  So I just grab them and throw them in the freezer
[50:53.080 --> 50:55.760]  as soon as, or freezer or refrigerator as soon as possible
[50:55.760 --> 50:57.120]  to keep moisture away from them.
[50:57.120 --> 50:57.960]  All right.
[50:57.960 --> 50:59.360]  And that way they prolong the life of them.
[50:59.360 --> 51:01.160]  You can kind of tell when they're good and when they're bad.
[51:01.160 --> 51:03.240]  And if they're nice and good and clear color, they're good.
[51:03.240 --> 51:05.120]  And if they turn like a dark or an amber color
[51:05.120 --> 51:07.520]  or a dark brown color, they're no longer useful.
[51:07.520 --> 51:09.320]  They've actually pulled moisture and bacteria
[51:09.320 --> 51:10.160]  and things out of the air,
[51:10.160 --> 51:11.640]  which gave them that color, they oxidized.
[51:11.640 --> 51:12.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:12.480 --> 51:14.280]  So they're no longer good.
[51:14.280 --> 51:15.480]  That's one good way to find out.
[51:15.480 --> 51:17.080]  When you crack it open, take a look.
[51:17.080 --> 51:19.400]  I always crack them open, put them all in a big jar
[51:19.400 --> 51:21.240]  and actually give them in my seed packages.
[51:21.240 --> 51:23.560]  Actually in our vials, we do a layer of beads
[51:23.560 --> 51:25.640]  that we do a layer and then we do a layer of cotton,
[51:25.640 --> 51:28.040]  then the seeds and the cotton, then the beads.
[51:28.040 --> 51:30.880]  That way it's like a 30 year storage vial.
[51:30.880 --> 51:31.720]  Nice.
[51:31.720 --> 51:33.320]  You can throw that in the refrigerator for 30 years
[51:33.320 --> 51:35.080]  and pull it out, pop those seeds.
[51:35.960 --> 51:36.800]  That's impressive.
[51:36.800 --> 51:37.640]  Yeah.
[51:37.640 --> 51:38.480]  It's simple.
[51:38.480 --> 51:39.320]  Now I have to up my game.
[51:39.320 --> 51:40.960]  It's simple but effective.
[51:40.960 --> 51:43.000]  Cause we got the mylar packaging,
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.960]  which in itself is a food saving package.
[51:44.960 --> 51:45.800]  Yeah.
[51:45.800 --> 51:48.200]  And then we had the vial inside and then we use those beads.
[51:48.200 --> 51:49.840]  A lot of the time girls would get them.
[51:49.840 --> 51:50.680]  If you don't get them,
[51:50.680 --> 51:53.000]  that's cause we didn't have any to get right at the moment.
[51:53.000 --> 51:54.880]  But either way you still get the cotton
[51:54.880 --> 51:56.600]  and the vial and everything else like that.
[51:56.600 --> 51:58.480]  But typically we always put beads in there with them.
[51:58.480 --> 51:59.840]  And people have asked me, what's that for?
[51:59.840 --> 52:01.920]  Testers have asked me, what are these beads for?
[52:01.920 --> 52:03.160]  You know, are the seeds in there?
[52:03.160 --> 52:04.880]  I've had one guy ask me, are the seeds in there?
[52:04.880 --> 52:06.640]  Cause he couldn't see them in the cotton.
[52:06.640 --> 52:07.640]  He couldn't see them in the cotton
[52:07.640 --> 52:09.920]  and there was just these little silicone beads in there.
[52:09.920 --> 52:12.480]  And you know, it also kind of throws them off
[52:12.480 --> 52:14.320]  if you're looking for them in the mail, things like that.
[52:14.320 --> 52:15.160]  That's helpful.
[52:15.160 --> 52:18.520]  But yeah, in a refrigerator store, not freezer.
[52:18.520 --> 52:20.160]  I would say you don't want to, you don't want a freezer.
[52:20.160 --> 52:22.960]  Cause once you get below freezing point,
[52:22.960 --> 52:25.760]  you're basically the water inside of the embryo
[52:25.760 --> 52:27.480]  is trying to expand.
[52:27.480 --> 52:28.680]  Right. You'll have more cracks.
[52:28.680 --> 52:30.000]  That's basically, you're basically creating
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.080]  a large earthquake inside of your embryo
[52:32.080 --> 52:34.600]  because it's trying to expand and crack outwards.
[52:35.560 --> 52:37.000]  And it has nowhere else to go.
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.520]  It's isolated in that shell.
[52:38.520 --> 52:40.680]  So all the water in there is going to crack and expand
[52:40.680 --> 52:43.080]  that embryo and destroy it.
[52:43.080 --> 52:45.240]  So you really want to stay anything above
[52:45.240 --> 52:46.920]  freezing temperature, 32 degrees, bro.
[52:46.920 --> 52:47.760]  All right.
[52:47.760 --> 52:48.960]  But now here's my favorite part.
[52:48.960 --> 52:50.400]  Once you've got a whole bunch of seeds,
[52:50.400 --> 52:52.320]  you've got your herbs separated.
[52:52.320 --> 52:53.420]  Do something with that herb.
[52:53.420 --> 52:54.740]  We're going to move on to talk about seeds.
[52:54.740 --> 52:57.240]  My favorite part, grow a bunch of the things.
[52:57.240 --> 52:58.080]  That's right.
[52:58.080 --> 52:59.080]  Get as many as you can.
[52:59.080 --> 52:59.920]  That's right.
[52:59.920 --> 53:01.320]  And figure out how much space you've got
[53:01.320 --> 53:04.280]  and then grow, plant more seeds than that.
[53:04.280 --> 53:05.120]  Because you're going to have-
[53:05.120 --> 53:06.680]  Even if you're not a large scale breeder
[53:06.680 --> 53:08.360]  and you have 500 seeds, you know,
[53:08.360 --> 53:10.560]  give them to your friends and do your own testing.
[53:10.560 --> 53:12.000]  You know, that's the way to do it.
[53:12.120 --> 53:13.080]  Give them to guys like me.
[53:13.080 --> 53:14.160]  Give them to guys like Will.
[53:14.160 --> 53:15.000]  That's right.
[53:15.000 --> 53:15.820]  You never take some.
[53:15.820 --> 53:16.660]  We'll grow them.
[53:16.660 --> 53:17.500]  We're not afraid.
[53:17.500 --> 53:18.320]  You might have some amazing shit.
[53:18.320 --> 53:19.160]  That's right.
[53:19.160 --> 53:20.280]  We'll grow 10 of them for you.
[53:20.280 --> 53:23.200]  I got some in from California called Silver Widow
[53:23.200 --> 53:26.120]  and it's a super silver haze white widow cross.
[53:26.120 --> 53:28.520]  That's going to take 112 days to finish.
[53:28.520 --> 53:29.920]  Yeah.
[53:29.920 --> 53:31.160]  Some of the pictures look great.
[53:31.160 --> 53:33.800]  And you know, there's some good phenotypes.
[53:33.800 --> 53:35.000]  I know that are there.
[53:35.000 --> 53:35.820]  They're there.
[53:35.820 --> 53:36.660]  You have to find them, but-
[53:36.660 --> 53:37.500]  Oh yeah.
[53:37.500 --> 53:38.320]  It's a search.
[53:38.320 --> 53:39.160]  Yeah.
[53:39.160 --> 53:40.000]  It's a search.
[53:40.000 --> 53:40.820]  You know, you just,
[53:40.820 --> 53:41.660]  and if there's nothing there,
[53:42.320 --> 53:43.160]  you know, you just go in and that's just how it works.
[53:43.160 --> 53:45.860]  Afterwards we smoke it and blast it, whatever we do.
[53:45.860 --> 53:49.260]  And you know, it goes going on to the next project.
[53:49.260 --> 53:51.180]  You know, you got to have a passion for doing what you do.
[53:51.180 --> 53:52.820]  And that's a lot of it too.
[53:52.820 --> 53:55.300]  And that's another thing we're looking for at testers.
[53:55.300 --> 53:56.700]  That's passion.
[53:56.700 --> 53:57.540]  Passion.
[53:57.540 --> 53:59.860]  That's how many people dedicated to what they do
[53:59.860 --> 54:01.340]  just because they do it anyway.
[54:01.340 --> 54:03.300]  What percentage of your breeding project
[54:03.300 --> 54:04.420]  gets totally scrapped?
[54:04.420 --> 54:05.860]  So you breed, you make seeds,
[54:05.860 --> 54:06.900]  you take a few of those seeds,
[54:06.900 --> 54:08.740]  you grow out so many of them and then you go,
[54:09.700 --> 54:11.420]  how many times have you just completely
[54:11.420 --> 54:12.940]  flushed a bag of seeds down the toilet
[54:12.940 --> 54:14.740]  because the project wasn't worth a shit?
[54:14.740 --> 54:17.300]  I'd say at least 30, 40% of the time.
[54:17.300 --> 54:18.980]  That's a good breeder right there.
[54:18.980 --> 54:19.820]  I'd say literally.
[54:19.820 --> 54:22.460]  I just actually went through my box like two weeks ago, man,
[54:22.460 --> 54:25.380]  and just threw away like handfuls and handfuls of stuff.
[54:25.380 --> 54:26.220]  Yep.
[54:26.220 --> 54:27.260]  A lot of stuff from Michigan,
[54:27.260 --> 54:28.980]  a lot of stuff I did back in Florida.
[54:28.980 --> 54:31.700]  A lot of the old stuff I had, just tossing it.
[54:31.700 --> 54:33.700]  As a breeder, it's important that you don't
[54:33.700 --> 54:35.380]  get your ego stuck on a strain.
[54:35.380 --> 54:38.180]  You might really think that this cross you've got
[54:38.180 --> 54:39.940]  and this male you've got is gonna make
[54:39.940 --> 54:41.900]  the next fucking hype.
[54:41.900 --> 54:44.220]  And if it doesn't, don't be afraid to throw it away.
[54:44.220 --> 54:45.060]  Go ahead and toss it.
[54:45.060 --> 54:47.460]  We don't want those shitty seeds out on the market.
[54:47.460 --> 54:50.420]  You can breed again, you can make something way better,
[54:50.420 --> 54:51.780]  and then you're not gonna be known as that guy
[54:51.780 --> 54:53.580]  that made that hermaphroditic weak shit.
[54:53.580 --> 54:55.820]  You might be that guy that made that next flame.
[54:55.820 --> 54:56.900]  You never know.
[54:56.900 --> 54:57.740]  And we wanna know.
[54:57.740 --> 54:59.460]  We wanna know if you got problems with the seeds.
[54:59.460 --> 55:01.220]  We wanna know if you do a great garden
[55:01.220 --> 55:03.220]  and you're automatically having hermaphroditic problems
[55:03.220 --> 55:04.060]  and things like that.
[55:04.060 --> 55:05.940]  We want to know these things.
[55:05.940 --> 55:06.780]  That's a lot of it.
[55:06.780 --> 55:07.700]  Some breeders don't wanna know,
[55:08.220 --> 55:09.660]  some breeders are too big to give a shit.
[55:09.660 --> 55:11.820]  But we're not those guys.
[55:12.780 --> 55:14.340]  I know that for a fact.
[55:14.340 --> 55:15.980]  We're always down to answer questions
[55:15.980 --> 55:17.900]  and that's why we're here right now.
[55:17.900 --> 55:19.460]  Yeah, well thanks for coming for a few, man.
[55:19.460 --> 55:20.300]  I appreciate it.
[55:20.300 --> 55:21.140]  What else do you think we should cover?
[55:21.140 --> 55:22.580]  We got all the way down to growing them,
[55:22.580 --> 55:23.420]  giving them back to your friends.
[55:23.420 --> 55:24.540]  I think we got some start to finish.
[55:24.540 --> 55:26.060]  Grow them, that's the next step.
[55:26.060 --> 55:26.900]  Take careful notes.
[55:26.900 --> 55:27.740]  The last thing you can do is grow them.
[55:27.740 --> 55:29.660]  Find the keepers, give them to your friends to grow.
[55:29.660 --> 55:30.620]  Phenohunt.
[55:30.620 --> 55:33.460]  Then make F2s because F2 is where shit gets really fun.
[55:33.460 --> 55:34.300]  Oh yeah.
[55:34.300 --> 55:37.300]  Then you get recessive segregation.
[55:37.540 --> 55:38.780]  Transgressive segregation?
[55:38.780 --> 55:39.620]  Yeah, that's it.
[55:39.620 --> 55:40.540]  Transgressive segregation.
[55:40.540 --> 55:42.820]  That's where your offspring will show better traits
[55:42.820 --> 55:44.140]  than its parents.
[55:44.140 --> 55:45.460]  It'll outperform each parent.
[55:45.460 --> 55:47.540]  So yeah, you'll see some cool shit happening there.
[55:47.540 --> 55:49.620]  Don't believe in too much hype that you hear on things.
[55:49.620 --> 55:52.020]  Either try it for yourself and make your own determination.
[55:52.020 --> 55:52.860]  True, yeah.
[55:52.860 --> 55:54.260]  Don't be afraid to get in there and grow some stuff.
[55:54.260 --> 55:56.180]  I've had F6 Lavenders from someone.
[55:56.180 --> 55:57.580]  Every one of them is Hermie.
[55:57.580 --> 55:59.620]  Ooh, wow, man.
[55:59.620 --> 56:03.460]  I mean, so you really...
[56:03.460 --> 56:04.780]  Would you attribute that to the way
[56:04.780 --> 56:06.780]  that he makes his pollen sometimes?
[56:07.580 --> 56:10.820]  He does and then he also does a lot of rottalization.
[56:10.820 --> 56:12.020]  I know that for a fact.
[56:12.020 --> 56:13.180]  He's written articles on it.
[56:13.180 --> 56:15.340]  I've read from him that he's done a lot of rottalization,
[56:15.340 --> 56:18.460]  which is basically taking a plant past its harvest point
[56:18.460 --> 56:20.660]  to the point where it's creating a female banana
[56:20.660 --> 56:22.340]  then harvesting a female banana,
[56:22.340 --> 56:24.140]  which basically is a hermaphroditic banana.
[56:24.140 --> 56:24.980]  Yep.
[56:24.980 --> 56:27.980]  And he also will light a fire
[56:27.980 --> 56:30.300]  and almost put the plant on fire.
[56:30.300 --> 56:31.540]  So it goes into a panic mode
[56:31.540 --> 56:33.460]  and that panic mode makes it do the same thing.
[56:33.460 --> 56:36.380]  It makes it spit out herb flowers, which have herb pollen.
[56:36.820 --> 56:37.660]  You can also do it light stress.
[56:37.660 --> 56:38.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[56:38.500 --> 56:41.740]  So he does a lot of old school funky shit that...
[56:41.740 --> 56:42.580]  Shout out to Soma.
[56:42.580 --> 56:43.420]  Overwatering and stuff.
[56:43.420 --> 56:44.260]  He's done a lot of great things.
[56:44.260 --> 56:45.500]  No, no, he has some of his strains
[56:45.500 --> 56:46.380]  are some of the greatest ones
[56:46.380 --> 56:47.620]  and still to this day, like lavender,
[56:47.620 --> 56:49.300]  I mentioned that's a legendary strain.
[56:49.300 --> 56:51.300]  And when you get good phenotypes out of them,
[56:51.300 --> 56:52.140]  they taste amazing.
[56:52.140 --> 56:53.140]  That's so Gouda.
[56:53.140 --> 56:55.460]  Man, some of the best concentrates
[56:55.460 --> 56:57.380]  that lavender is on point, you know.
[56:57.380 --> 56:59.460]  But there's a lot of these old school strains.
[56:59.460 --> 57:01.860]  And Soma was one of the guys, if it wasn't for him,
[57:01.860 --> 57:04.020]  the New York City diesel really wouldn't be as hot
[57:04.020 --> 57:05.140]  today as it is.
[57:05.180 --> 57:07.020]  I really liked his...
[57:07.020 --> 57:08.940]  Oh man, the G13 Hayes.
[57:08.940 --> 57:11.460]  There's a G13 Hayes that I picked up a while back
[57:11.460 --> 57:13.140]  from Soma that was amazing.
[57:13.140 --> 57:14.780]  I loved the flavor of that shit.
[57:14.780 --> 57:16.280]  Some of the stuff is still hit and miss,
[57:16.280 --> 57:18.740]  but when you find the good keepers, they're keepers.
[57:18.740 --> 57:19.580]  You know what I'm saying?
[57:19.580 --> 57:20.700]  They're keepers, but you got a lot of run,
[57:20.700 --> 57:22.260]  a lot of his gear to find those keepers.
[57:22.260 --> 57:24.540]  It reminds me of like DJ Shorts the same way.
[57:24.540 --> 57:27.100]  And that's not to get you DJ, but hey, you know.
[57:28.460 --> 57:29.700]  Quit breeding girl weed.
[57:29.700 --> 57:34.700]  But DJ breeds specifically for what he wants.
[57:34.740 --> 57:35.580]  He doesn't give a shit about the market.
[57:35.580 --> 57:36.740]  He's a sativa lover.
[57:36.740 --> 57:37.580]  That's it.
[57:37.580 --> 57:39.160]  He's a sativa lover and that's what he breeds.
[57:39.160 --> 57:40.140]  And that's his thing, you know,
[57:40.140 --> 57:41.340]  but he has to understand, you know,
[57:41.340 --> 57:44.860]  there's, he does pay for a lot of his advertising.
[57:44.860 --> 57:46.740]  He gets great advertising, let me tell you that dude.
[57:46.740 --> 57:48.540]  And he's got some bad-ass advertising guys.
[57:48.540 --> 57:49.460]  I like his book.
[57:49.460 --> 57:51.580]  His book is definitely good.
[57:51.580 --> 57:52.540]  He's a great breeder.
[57:52.540 --> 57:54.220]  He's a great grower and things like that.
[57:54.220 --> 57:55.380]  Just not my forte.
[57:55.380 --> 57:57.540]  And you know, it's the same thing with him.
[57:57.540 --> 58:00.020]  You have to run a hundred seeds to get a good phenotype.
[58:00.020 --> 58:02.580]  You know, where it's like, I can generally say,
[58:02.620 --> 58:05.900]  I know you gauge me, can't adventure.
[58:05.900 --> 58:07.220]  Quite a few others in this game.
[58:07.220 --> 58:10.740]  I've had 10 packs and found three keepers out of.
[58:10.740 --> 58:12.260]  Heat, rare dankness.
[58:12.260 --> 58:15.380]  Rare dankness does those keepers, you know.
[58:15.380 --> 58:17.900]  I've gotten some really wonky plants from rare dankness.
[58:17.900 --> 58:18.740]  I was going to say.
[58:18.740 --> 58:19.580]  In the same 10 pack.
[58:19.580 --> 58:21.100]  Some gnarly looking rug burns.
[58:21.100 --> 58:23.220]  That would make up for all of the shit
[58:23.220 --> 58:24.060]  they've ever sold me.
[58:24.060 --> 58:24.900]  Right.
[58:24.900 --> 58:26.380]  Like, oh yeah, there's one right there.
[58:26.380 --> 58:27.220]  Right.
[58:27.220 --> 58:28.060]  Yeah.
[58:28.060 --> 58:28.880]  That's how it was with us with rug burn.
[58:28.880 --> 58:30.460]  We ran up through a bunch of rug burn seeds
[58:30.460 --> 58:31.460]  and every one of them was like,
[58:31.460 --> 58:33.260]  we got an eighth piece off of them.
[58:33.260 --> 58:37.500]  I was just like, this is the lankiest wonkiest looking.
[58:37.500 --> 58:38.340]  It smelled good.
[58:38.340 --> 58:40.060]  It looked good.
[58:40.060 --> 58:41.700]  You know, but it's just like, wow.
[58:41.700 --> 58:42.540]  You know.
[58:42.540 --> 58:44.300]  We don't, I don't think gauge gets enough credit
[58:44.300 --> 58:45.620]  in the game.
[58:45.620 --> 58:47.260]  Like people, more people need to notice
[58:47.260 --> 58:48.260]  gauge green genetics.
[58:48.260 --> 58:50.920]  That's a definitely a high end breeding company
[58:50.920 --> 58:52.420]  that gets overlooked in my opinion.
[58:52.420 --> 58:53.260]  I do.
[58:53.260 --> 58:54.080]  They're great.
[58:54.080 --> 58:54.920]  They're great breeders.
[58:54.920 --> 58:55.760]  I mean, they got good material they're working with.
[58:55.760 --> 58:56.580]  That's a lot of it.
[58:56.580 --> 58:58.100]  It's just the material they have is golden.
[58:58.100 --> 59:00.340]  Joseph Ochi is amazing.
[59:00.340 --> 59:01.180]  It is.
[59:01.180 --> 59:02.020]  You can't deny it.
[59:02.020 --> 59:03.900]  I mean, you cannot deny the thing made grape stomper
[59:03.900 --> 59:05.620]  and so many other great plants.
[59:05.620 --> 59:08.820]  And the Joseph ocean beach cross was one of the,
[59:08.820 --> 59:11.820]  one of the highly sought after,
[59:11.820 --> 59:14.380]  but yeah, very quick and gone plants.
[59:14.380 --> 59:16.460]  You know, that was, that was coming gone so fast
[59:16.460 --> 59:18.780]  because it went out basically as testers and never came back.
[59:18.780 --> 59:21.380]  I may still have a pack of testers from that.
[59:21.380 --> 59:22.300]  OB Rippers.
[59:22.300 --> 59:23.140]  Yeah.
[59:23.140 --> 59:23.960]  I might have some of those.
[59:23.960 --> 59:24.800]  OB Rippers and I.
[59:24.800 --> 59:25.620]  Maybe.
[59:25.620 --> 59:27.940]  I've got, honestly, I have a small manila envelope
[59:27.940 --> 59:29.860]  filled with gauge green genetics tester bags
[59:30.380 --> 59:31.700]  because you just used to send me so much
[59:31.700 --> 59:33.020]  and you'd be like, run what you can.
[59:33.020 --> 59:33.860]  Right.
[59:33.860 --> 59:34.680]  Yeah.
[59:34.680 --> 59:35.520]  Yeah.
[59:35.520 --> 59:36.540]  We took the dominant oceans out of that one,
[59:36.540 --> 59:38.560]  out of those and I actually bred with them too.
[59:38.560 --> 59:41.380]  We got a new one coming out with that pre 98 bubble
[59:41.380 --> 59:42.640]  also the OB Ripper.
[59:42.640 --> 59:43.480]  Yeah.
[59:43.480 --> 59:44.320]  I'd like to.
[59:44.320 --> 59:45.140]  Sort of like a close.
[59:45.140 --> 59:46.880]  Joseph, Joseph is just too stringy
[59:46.880 --> 59:48.220]  and I hate the way he does that.
[59:48.220 --> 59:49.380]  So we're going to hit him with that.
[59:49.380 --> 59:50.300]  We would hit that pre 90.
[59:50.300 --> 59:52.020]  I call it babe hind.
[59:52.020 --> 59:54.380]  But my prize mail is at a rise mail,
[59:54.380 --> 59:57.220]  which was started with a daybreaker mail from gauge.
[59:57.220 --> 59:58.060]  There you go.
[59:58.060 --> 59:58.900]  Yeah.
[59:58.900 --> 59:59.720]  I'm not afraid.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:01.800]  I had to admit that I've done dabs with them.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.840]  No, those are good kids.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.680]  They are.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.500]  They are.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.340]  And you know, we talked about it
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.400]  and you go to them with a 10 pack and be like,
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.440]  Hey, I got the Holy grail.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.400]  I'd be mine if I breathe.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.800]  They're going to look at you and key player.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.040]  Mike's going to tell you, go for it.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:11.880]  They'll help you name it.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.720]  That's it.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.560]  I can tell you go for it.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.920]  You got any names?
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.320]  You got to have respect for that.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.160]  Yeah.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.560]  I kind of use anything that I breed to the daybreaker.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.880]  I try to use, I don't copy gauge,
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.120]  but I use their scheme in the names,
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.680]  like a rise and cascade.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:29.280]  Those are all crosses that came from a gauge mail.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.840]  Yeah.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.040]  And just try to honor them in the cross.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:32.880]  Yeah.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.560]  You got to give a little bit of props to where it came from.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.040]  Respect to the elders.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.080]  So we did the Bay pine, you know,
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.280]  we put it in there just to Bay pine,
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.800]  California pine trees, you know,
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:42.800]  and it's where it's from.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.240]  So it's good a little homage back to Cali.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.080]  Yeah.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.600]  Got to give love to everybody that does it.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.320]  All right, you guys, we've been going for like an hour.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.120]  We need to start wrapping up this part of the show.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.200]  Will, you were a little bit quiet,
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.600]  but we talked a lot about seed breeding.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.960]  Yeah, I was here to learn.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.160]  You guys took me to school.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.840]  I hope you learned a whole bunch.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.660]  I definitely did.
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.260]  I took a Kalonji Kush from my seeds
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.020]  and that shit looked amazing.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:05.860]  I actually still have a mother from that cut.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:08.940]  And I just actually about to take a bunch of cuts this week.
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:09.780]  Yeah.
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:10.900]  Yeah, I would definitely take one.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.660]  I think it's better than the cut that I've got.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.860]  I remember you saying that a while back.
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:14.860]  Yeah, it's better than the cut.
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.300]  We've got the cut at Green and Healthy
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.700]  and your cut looks better.
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.580]  It's like covered in trikes.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:24.540]  It often gets confused for La Plata Labs' Durango OG.
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.780]  It looks very similar.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.340]  The smell on the Kalonji was,
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.060]  I had never smelled weed like that before.
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.020]  Everyone I showed it to was like,
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.420]  what the hell, this is crazy.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.260]  Nice.
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.100]  So definitely stoked on that one.
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:35.940]  Good find.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.780]  Oh yeah.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.600]  Good phenohunt.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.440]  Oh yeah.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.280]  Cool.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.100]  Man, where can people find you on social media?
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.220]  You can find me on Instagram.
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.980]  It's the, let me see if I'm underscored.
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:43.820]  I can't remember.
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.540]  I think it's the Barefoot Grower.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.380]  I think it's Barefoot underscore Grower.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:48.820]  Yeah, the underscore Barefoot underscore Grower.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:49.660]  Okay.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:50.500]  That's me on Instagram.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.620]  It's really all I got going on.
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:52.460]  All right.
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.540]  You got pictures of the new grow at work up there?
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:55.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.900]  I work over at a Syn Cannabis company.
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.060]  You can find them on Instagram too.
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.420]  It's just at a Syn Cannabis company, A-S-E-E-N-D.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.700]  Oh man, that might be a new strain name, a Syn.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:04.540]  That's a good one.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:05.380]  I like that.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.420]  I was actually thinking about that the other day.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.260]  It's messed up.
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.080]  That is messed up.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:08.920]  You can have it, bro.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:09.760]  It's yours.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.580]  Go for it.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:12.940]  No, obviously what made me think about it was Arise.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:13.780]  That's nice.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.980]  I swear straight up, dude.
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.820]  I was like, that's a good name for a thing.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:17.980]  Cause I go in a can of sewer a lot
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.340]  and they run your Arise in there.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:20.180]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.420]  Yeah, they actually, they actually.
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.260]  Really cool.
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:23.920]  Can of sewer runs your Arise.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.760]  Really neat.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:25.920]  That's awesome.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.240]  It's one of the favorites of the bud tenders in there.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.080]  Oh shit.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.360]  Well, shout out to the can of sewer, I guess.
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.640]  I'm gonna have to stop in there and buy an eighth
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.480]  just to see what it's like.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.840]  Well, you know, the only reason why I ever go
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.600]  into that place is because they're like the only place
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.760]  in Pueblo West that doesn't just rape you.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.680]  You know, I can go in and get 125 ounces
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.000]  if I'm out between harvest.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.160]  You know, and it's, it's, the weed's crap, but you know.
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.000]  I was not gonna ask.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:47.840]  Step it up.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:48.660]  I wasn't gonna ask.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.500]  Step it up, guys.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.760]  I was just gonna let you have that one.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.580]  It's fine.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:52.420]  I'm just gonna say it.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.240]  The weed's crap.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240]  Quit using machines.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.880]  Oh man, trim machines suck.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.720]  Hire people.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.540]  Employ humans.
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.380]  That's it.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.200]  Come on, support your community.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.120]  That's what's really, stop cutting it early.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.280]  Quit doing machine work.
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.040]  That's a lot of what the problem is.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.440]  Once they do that, they got a fantastic looking grow.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.260]  It's clean.
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.100]  It's nice.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.440]  You know, it looks good.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.780]  They overfeed a little bit.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.000]  You know, when your plants look like they're tying
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.240]  your shoes, it's time to back off a little bit.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.000]  But speaking of, speaking of trimming weed,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.100]  I owe a shout out to my buddy, John Randles Jr.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.740]  That dude trims for 40 hours a week with no complaints,
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.900]  puts his head down and fucking cuts up weed.
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:25.740]  Good job, brother.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.560]  Thank you.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.860]  I appreciate having you on the team.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.700]  Keep it up.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:29.740]  Do your thing.
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.300]  Will, did we cover all of your social media?
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:34.380]  Yes, the underscore barefoot underscore grower.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:35.660]  Make sure you support my friend Will.
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:36.500]  Check out his pictures.
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.180]  He's got some cool shit up there.
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.020]  I think so too.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:39.840]  Thank you.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.680]  Yeah, for sure, man.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.520]  I appreciate your big ass grow.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.340]  Oh yeah, man.
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.420]  I love it over there.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.340]  He posts some cool shit on.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.580]  Do you want these people to follow you on Snapchat also?
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.420]  Sure, yeah.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.300]  I think, let's see what Snapchat.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.980]  This thing is illzweezy on Snapchat.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.620]  Let's see here.
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:54.780]  Yeah, Snapchat's picky.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.500]  You can find me as the barefoot grower on Snapchat
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.860]  or illzweezy on Snapchat.
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.300]  They're both my usernames.
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.140]  I guess you got two.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.500]  You can see his morning dabs.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.780]  Yeah, I stay on Snapchat during the day
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.220]  where I post a lot of what we got going on over there.
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.040]  We do a lot every day.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.740]  So if you're interested in what goes on
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:13.520]  in a huge greenhouse on the daily, definitely hit me up.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.460]  It entertains me.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.540]  So it will definitely entertain the average grower.
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:17.380]  Check it out.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.660]  Rob, how can people find you on the social media?
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.820]  Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:25.060]  That's pretty much where we're at right now.
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:26.580]  You guys, the Sour Seed Company?
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:27.420]  All right.
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.240]  Sour Seed Co.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.080]  All right.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:29.920]  That's it.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:30.740]  You have a website yet?
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:31.580]  We had one.
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:32.420]  I took it down for a little while.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.240]  I'm gonna redo everything.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.740]  I'm just gonna redo everything from scratch again.
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.340]  And no more forum.
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:37.660]  We're just gonna go all out.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.420]  The forum gets to be a pain in the ass, doesn't it?
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.540]  It does, it does.
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:42.500]  And then you have a lot of spam.
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:43.340]  That's what I have.
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.780]  And the main thing is the money.
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.940]  To get a good host that doesn't have a lot of spam
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.780]  and security and everything else, it costs you a fortune.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.140]  I've got Chinese and Russian hackers
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.340]  trying to get into my forum every single day.
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:54.300]  I wanna sell you those Ray-Bans.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:55.140]  That's right.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.940]  They join the forum and then they just go
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:59.180]  and they type in, in the forum,
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:01.620]  they figure out how to put in script in their forum post
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:03.100]  that can corrupt my website.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.420]  And then they start stealing shit out of my website.
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.900]  And then redirecting it.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.140]  And yeah, this happened twice now.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.980]  But I'm gonna walk down pretty well now.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:11.980]  I think I feel like I just taunted people.
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:14.500]  But please don't fuck up my website.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.100]  We had a great moderator, but it was a lot on him too.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.260]  You know, it was like taking a path of his day.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.420]  Just trying to get rid of stuff.
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:21.380]  Yeah, I'm the moderator.
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:22.740]  I get the email that says a hacker
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.100]  has registered to your forum.
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.180]  And I have to go delete their account, block them,
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.020]  delete all their posts.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.820]  Shout out to Vinny for doing all that work on our forum.
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:30.660]  But yeah, we shut it down.
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.660]  We're doing a website now.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.860]  And we do have a website for the hat pins.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.660]  710hatpins.com.
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:37.500]  Check those guys out.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.940]  He just brought me two dope ass hat pins.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.260]  I got the little, the zombie pin doll.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.500]  And I got the new Sour Seed Co. logo for my hat.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.340]  That's gonna look fresh.
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.340]  I know where they're gonna go.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:46.180]  Those look awesome.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.020]  Yeah, check us out.
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.340]  We do 12.99 free shipping.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.220]  We don't discriminate.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:50.340]  All of our hat pins are the same.
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.140]  If you have more than three hat pins
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:55.940]  on your hat, purse, and or backpack, you are a Wook.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.780]  That is the official rule.
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:57.620]  You look official.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.780]  Yes, three pins is the limit.
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:00.820]  Three pins.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.060]  We can all agree on three pins, right?
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.060]  Everyone looks solid.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:03.900]  Three is the limit.
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.740]  All right, more than three pins and you're a Wook.
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.300]  Three, three, three makes you a Wook.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.140]  Two pins, you're all right.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.300]  Three, you are a Wook.
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.620]  I have like 15 on my backpack right now.
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:14.980]  But I make hat pins for a living, so I have an excuse.
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.020]  You've got an excuse.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:18.020]  I got the iRegenetics pin on everything.
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.860]  I got that one in my frame.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.300]  That's in my personal collection.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.140]  Nice.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.620]  Those are most of mine are on a frame.
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:25.500]  I don't think I have any on my hats, actually.
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.260]  I just rocked the one on the hat.
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.180]  That's all I need.
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:29.820]  Good enough, but I am a Wook.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.900]  I'll take credit for that.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:31.740]  Yeah.
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:33.620]  All right, we've been going for a long time.
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.540]  Make sure you follow my friends
