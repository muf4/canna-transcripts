[01:31.670 --> 01:37.270]  Let's move into everybody's favorite portion of the show. That is the question and answer part of the podcast
[01:37.390 --> 01:42.350]  This question came from the grow help tab on the iri genetics website. That's right
[01:42.350 --> 01:45.590]  If you go to my website iri genetics calm on the top
[01:45.590 --> 01:49.430]  There's a row of tabs one will say grow questions or grow help click on that tab
[01:49.430 --> 01:51.470]  We do ask you a few preliminary questions
[01:51.470 --> 01:54.190]  And then we let you type in what the problem is in your grow
[01:54.270 --> 01:59.510]  This message came from my buddy Dave G from Ontario big shout out to my buddy Dave G from Ontario
[01:59.510 --> 02:00.230]  Hey Dave
[02:00.230 --> 02:04.990]  Please send me your address because I do owe you a free pack of seeds because I read your letter here on the show
[02:05.230 --> 02:10.990]  This one goes a little bit like this it says hey Ross to Jeff, it's Dave from Ontario. What's up, dude?
[02:10.990 --> 02:15.710]  It's been a minute since I've heard from you. I hope all is well up there. It says happy belated birthday, my friend
[02:15.710 --> 02:20.230]  Yes, the birthday was in March. I'm reading this a little bit after that. But thank you for the great birthday wishes
[02:20.230 --> 02:25.590]  I do appreciate that the birthday was wonderful. There is more it says you may remember me
[02:25.590 --> 02:29.750]  I sent a few emails about a year ago. Yeah, but I definitely remember you your name stands out
[02:29.870 --> 02:35.110]  It is a couple of which have appeared on the podcast I was growing Raphael and sun kiss at the time
[02:35.190 --> 02:41.190]  Yes, great work, but I do remember you totally recall you it says we share the same birthday. That's a great fact
[02:41.190 --> 02:45.990]  Thank you. Happy birthday, bro. It says we are both comedy nerds. Yes. I'm a huge comedy nerd
[02:46.470 --> 02:51.310]  Comedy is one of my favorite things one of my favorite ways to spend an evening is to go see a live comedy show
[02:51.630 --> 02:54.190]  It says we've both acquired brain injuries. Yes
[02:54.590 --> 02:58.370]  We may have some new viewers new listeners new followers here on the podcast in
[02:58.890 --> 03:05.170]  2015 I suffered a major traumatic brain injury. It messed me up so bad. I didn't know my name. I couldn't do math
[03:05.170 --> 03:08.970]  I missed a bunch of appointments and people were calling me saying hey, bro. Where are you?
[03:08.970 --> 03:12.730]  And I was saying I don't even know who you are. Why are you calling me? I really messed me up
[03:12.730 --> 03:18.690]  That was in 2015. There were a few months there where I was not myself. It was a long year of recovery
[03:18.690 --> 03:25.490]  There are still weird glitches tics and problems that arise from that brain injury occasionally, but I mostly recovered from that
[03:25.490 --> 03:27.810]  I'm sure it messed up my personality my memory
[03:28.610 --> 03:31.090]  Right after my brain injury. I didn't give a shit anymore
[03:31.090 --> 03:36.010]  There were things I should care about but I just stopped giving a shit about a lot of things after my brain injury
[03:36.050 --> 03:39.970]  So anyway, just to bring some old listeners up or some new listeners up to speed in
[03:40.650 --> 03:47.370]  2015 I did experience a major traumatic brain injury that uh, it caused me some big problems. I had visual problems memory problems
[03:47.370 --> 03:48.570]  I was hallucinating a lot
[03:48.570 --> 03:53.770]  I was saying weird shit and eventually the swelling in my brain healed up and I am much better now
[03:53.770 --> 03:57.370]  But sometimes you guys that's why I'm fucking weird. That's part of why I'm fucking weird
[03:57.370 --> 04:02.130]  I was already a little bit goofy before the brain injury. The brain injury just kind of amplified that weirdness
[04:02.130 --> 04:07.010]  Let me stay focused. Also the lack of focus is from the brain injury. Let me keep going
[04:07.010 --> 04:14.090]  It says we both love cannabis cannabis at a maximum level. Yes, that is absolutely true. I am completely in love and
[04:15.090 --> 04:20.730]  Infatuated and passionate about this ganja plant that we all love here. I love that. It's got so many great uses. I
[04:21.570 --> 04:23.570]  smoke it for
[04:23.570 --> 04:29.610]  Medical and recreational purposes somewhere in the middle. I say I always say my first dab. That's a medical dab that second dab
[04:29.610 --> 04:32.610]  That's that's kind of a supplementary dab that third dab
[04:32.610 --> 04:37.530]  That one's all recreational the first to cure all the problems. The third one is just to have a good time
[04:37.530 --> 04:42.730]  So I'm a recreational and a medical cannabis consumer. I not only love the relief and
[04:43.370 --> 04:47.330]  The fun that it gives me but I love seeing other people smoke cannabis and feel better
[04:47.330 --> 04:52.890]  I was part of the first dispensary in my neighborhood the first dispensary in my city and I got to see
[04:53.250 --> 04:58.410]  all walks of life come through that shop young dudes old ladies and everything in between and
[04:58.570 --> 05:00.610]  I would see people come in and they would say hey
[05:00.610 --> 05:07.330]  I'm suffering from this condition and I would develop a relationship with them and recommend cannabis products if it was smokeables edibles
[05:07.330 --> 05:12.530]  Whatever topicals we'd get them going in a few weeks when we figured out the right products for them
[05:12.530 --> 05:15.890]  They would come back and I could see an improvement in the quality of their life
[05:15.890 --> 05:19.730]  And that is amazing that this plant can do that. It can improve the quality of our lives
[05:20.010 --> 05:25.810]  Then we've got the social aspect who doesn't like to hang out and smoke with a bro or a lady or both or whatever
[05:26.250 --> 05:28.770]  Smoking with people is one of my favorite experiences
[05:28.770 --> 05:32.690]  And then I also love the creative aspect of this ganja plant when I smoke
[05:32.690 --> 05:38.250]  I'm a musician when I smoke I want to go play music music sounds better food tastes better
[05:38.250 --> 05:43.990]  Life is just a little bit better with this ganja plant and I love how multifaceted this plant is and how many great
[05:44.350 --> 05:47.110]  Positive benefits we get from the same plant
[05:47.110 --> 05:50.550]  So you are absolutely correct with the idea that we both love cannabis
[05:50.550 --> 05:53.310]  I can tell that you love cannabis as much as I do because you've been around
[05:53.550 --> 05:58.150]  For a long time you've sent a lot of messages and we have interacted a bit and it's been over a year
[05:58.150 --> 06:01.390]  So that means that you are definitely committed to this ganja plant now
[06:01.390 --> 06:04.230]  Like I said before I do have that brain injury. So I get a little bit rambly
[06:04.230 --> 06:07.010]  Let me get myself back on track. There's more to this message
[06:07.010 --> 06:12.150]  It says are you and I the same person on different planes of existence? I don't know man
[06:12.230 --> 06:16.030]  There are some interesting coincidences. Anyway, that is really funny
[06:16.030 --> 06:21.670]  I do believe in parallel universes and I do believe in weird things like that. So maybe somewhere along the line, bro
[06:21.670 --> 06:25.990]  We've got some of the same timeline programmed into us. Maybe the matrix spit us out at the same time
[06:26.310 --> 06:30.770]  Whatever human printer you believe in maybe we came from the same human printing factory
[06:30.770 --> 06:35.230]  I don't know bro, but I love that. We're such good friends and we don't even know each other. That's fucking awesome
[06:35.230 --> 06:38.030]  Did we just become best friends, bro? There's more to this
[06:38.030 --> 06:41.750]  It says cool if you remember me, no big deal. If not, bro, I remember you
[06:41.750 --> 06:43.630]  How would I not remember my best friend?
[06:43.630 --> 06:47.830]  It says I'm back and growing some fluff head which I acquired from the dudes world
[06:48.110 --> 06:53.750]  Big shout out to dudes world. Check out the dudes world if you need some iri genetics means if they're in Canada big up, dude
[06:53.750 --> 06:59.630]  I hope you're doing well, bro. Also, there's more it says I'm running three plants and noticing some differences and
[07:00.790 --> 07:06.870]  Similarities that's a good thing to observe then it says I have a question regarding powdery mildew and its resistance
[07:06.870 --> 07:09.190]  This is where this part gets fun. Now it goes on
[07:09.190 --> 07:16.590]  It says is powdery mildew resistance a phenotypical trade meaning that two plants from the same population can possibly display
[07:17.110 --> 07:19.070]  different levels of resistance
[07:19.070 --> 07:20.830]  The quick answer to that is yes
[07:20.830 --> 07:25.350]  That is a phenotypical trade just like one of those plants may smell more like one thing
[07:25.350 --> 07:27.350]  The other one may smell like another thing
[07:27.390 --> 07:32.670]  That is absolutely a phenotypical traits. You could put both of those plants on the same room
[07:32.670 --> 07:38.790]  We could introduce powdery mildew on purpose and you'll see one may decimate one plant and one may not touch the other plant
[07:38.790 --> 07:42.590]  That is absolutely a phenotypical trait. Now. He does give an example
[07:42.590 --> 07:49.550]  He said I've got fluff head could my fluff head number one and fluff head number two have the same PM resistance
[07:49.550 --> 07:55.710]  No, they're it's very likely very possible that they will be different. Those are bred from two vastly different parents
[07:55.710 --> 08:00.510]  We've got the afterglow which grows kind of tall and skinny and it's got those long thin tropical leaves
[08:00.510 --> 08:03.230]  And then we've got the chem4 which grows differently than that
[08:03.230 --> 08:07.150]  It's shorter squat of your bigger leaves totally different flavor profiles
[08:07.150 --> 08:13.470]  And since we've started with two vastly different ingredients, we can expect vastly different outcomes in some of those phenotypes
[08:13.590 --> 08:19.590]  Some of them may be completely powdery mildew resistant and some of them may be susceptible to powdery mildew resistance
[08:19.590 --> 08:25.470]  I do know that the afterglow is generally resistant to the powdery mildew but compared to other phenotypes
[08:25.470 --> 08:29.310]  You are going to see differences in that level of resistance
[08:29.310 --> 08:33.670]  The message says hopefully I worded that well for you. I'll be back with more questions
[08:33.670 --> 08:37.470]  Especially now that you're giving out seeds for the questions. That's right guys
[08:37.470 --> 08:41.630]  I'm not sure if I mentioned this but if you send me a grow question on the grow health tab at
[08:41.830 --> 08:46.790]  IREGENETICS.COM and I read that question here on the show you win a free pack of IREGENETICS seeds
[08:46.790 --> 08:52.350]  So my buddy Dave up there in Ontario has won himself a free pack of seeds Dave you worded this perfectly, bro
[08:52.350 --> 08:56.110]  I totally understand the question. You're basically one and this goes for every strain
[08:56.110 --> 09:00.070]  We highlighted fluff head here in this question because that's what my buddy is growing
[09:00.070 --> 09:06.030]  But this goes with every strain now do keep in mind that many strains are powdery mildew resistant
[09:06.030 --> 09:10.150]  If they're bred in areas where powdery mildew is common over several generations
[09:10.150 --> 09:14.510]  Those plants will build that powdery mildew resistance that just naturally will be in there
[09:14.510 --> 09:21.470]  A lot of plants do have that some plants on the other hand just are naturally susceptible to the powdery mildew now within those two categories
[09:21.550 --> 09:25.390]  We're going to see the plants that really get it and the plants that don't get it
[09:25.390 --> 09:31.350]  That's just a phenotypical trait or an expression. All right, let me make sure I wrapped all this up. Thanks for the great content
[09:31.350 --> 09:33.350]  It has helped me out on my journey, bro
[09:33.350 --> 09:39.070]  That is what the whole point of this is to get everybody on a great cannabis journey growing can be very frustrating
[09:39.070 --> 09:44.230]  There are a lot of trials and tribulations that come along with cannabis growing. There's a lot of bullshit information out there
[09:44.230 --> 09:48.550]  I'm trying to get everybody on a good path and growing the best possible cannabis
[09:48.550 --> 09:53.710]  They can grow and enjoying it while they do it because we can all grow good weed and struggle at the same time
[09:53.710 --> 10:01.310]  Let's try to make it easy for everybody. The last line is my favorite. It says you are my cannabis hero sincerely from Dave, bro
[10:01.310 --> 10:06.710]  I didn't know that I was anybody's hero, but that does mean a lot to me much respect big fist bruh, bro
[10:06.710 --> 10:12.070]  Thank you. Stay cool up there in Canada and send me more questions. Dave also send me your address
[10:12.070 --> 10:17.510]  I think I may have it already, but please do refresh my memory because we talked about that brain injury, bro
[10:17.510 --> 10:22.030]  You know what? I'm talking about. I'd love to get you a pack of seeds up there in Canada land
[10:22.270 --> 10:26.230]  All right, we've got a good flow going. There's no need to take a break now. Let's keep going
[10:26.230 --> 10:32.070]  I've got another question here in front of me. This one also came from the grow help tab on the iReed genetics website
[10:32.070 --> 10:37.070]  This one came from our buddy. Philip ong. I like that name a lot. What up Philip ong you fill a bong?
[10:37.070 --> 10:42.470]  I'll rip a bong. All right, the question goes first of all, I love your podcast. Thank you, bro
[10:42.470 --> 10:44.750]  That is a great compliment and a good way to start a message
[10:44.830 --> 10:50.430]  That says they are extremely helpful and you are a great person for sharing your knowledge I appreciate that
[10:50.990 --> 10:56.550]  I know that it's kindness and all that stuff that does it but also there's some weird thing inside of me that I feel like
[10:56.550 --> 11:00.430]  I would explode if I didn't share my knowledge and kind of help you guys in this way
[11:00.430 --> 11:02.990]  I was given the gift of being able to
[11:03.790 --> 11:09.550]  Receive information and also filter out the bullshit. That's one of my big gifts. I can receive information
[11:09.550 --> 11:14.630]  I can read I can research and I can hear a bunch of things and then I can put that into a small package
[11:14.750 --> 11:19.670]  And re-deliver it in a way that everybody can understand it that way you guys don't have to stay up till 6 in the morning
[11:19.670 --> 11:23.070]  Reading the internet. I already did that for you and I'll come put that out for you
[11:23.070 --> 11:27.230]  I feel like I'm I'm compelled by I don't know what you believe in. They call me Rasta Jeff
[11:27.230 --> 11:30.910]  I wear red gold and green colors all the time. You know what I believe in that's not important
[11:30.910 --> 11:34.870]  Whatever you believe in that compels me to share this message with you
[11:34.870 --> 11:40.570]  And that just and if I didn't share that message, it would be disrespectful to whatever gave me this gift in this energy
[11:40.570 --> 11:45.770]  So thank you for noticing. Thank you for mentioning that I share this knowledge. So it does go on
[11:45.770 --> 11:51.450]  there's actually content to the message that says I've been growing for a couple of years and a 4x4 tent and I have been searching
[11:51.570 --> 11:57.490]  For some prime females and I now have a few so far including lemon Jeffrey and an orange chasm
[11:57.490 --> 12:01.130]  That is very promising at this point. Alright, so we're growing in a 4x4
[12:01.130 --> 12:06.290]  You've been searching for some stuff and you've got a lemon Jeff and an orange chasm. I'm glad I'm glad you found those
[12:06.290 --> 12:08.410]  Those are great lines. They're gonna do very well for you
[12:08.570 --> 12:15.370]  It also says I've always wanted to create my own strains since I started smoking 28 years ago, bro, we're on the same team
[12:15.370 --> 12:21.170]  We're og veteran smokers. And also I understand that feeling of wanting to create strains something about it
[12:21.170 --> 12:25.090]  You just know you're like I could breed something and then it's in you so you're ready to do it, bro
[12:25.090 --> 12:26.010]  Let's get it on
[12:26.010 --> 12:32.010]  Anyway, it says I found a male that I've been keeping for a while and I really like and I'm going to do a pollen
[12:32.010 --> 12:36.170]  Run in the next month after I finish up this flower run sounds like a good strategy
[12:36.170 --> 12:39.970]  This male has a structure I want and the smell is exactly what I want
[12:39.970 --> 12:44.010]  I want to collect as much pollen as I can and hold on to it. That's a good strategy
[12:44.010 --> 12:46.530]  I don't collect pollen most of the time
[12:46.530 --> 12:51.850]  I honestly just do live plant pollination plant porn if you will but your collection idea will work
[12:51.930 --> 12:56.530]  It says at what point in flower should I pollinate the females for best results?
[12:56.530 --> 13:02.250]  I know it won't be the same time for every female and plant but a general idea is all I need and I can play
[13:02.250 --> 13:06.250]  With it from there. Thank you for all you do from the community. Peace from
[13:06.850 --> 13:10.010]  Philip on big shout out to my buddy Philip on this is a great question
[13:10.010 --> 13:11.770]  I don't remember if I've said this or not
[13:11.770 --> 13:17.970]  But Philip on please do send me your real name and your shipping address so that I can get you a free pack of iReed
[13:17.970 --> 13:23.290]  Genetic seeds, of course that seed giveaway is sponsored by iReed direct comm make sure you go check out
[13:23.290 --> 13:29.370]  I redirect for all the recent restocks and drops, but now let's answer this question about pollination timing
[13:29.370 --> 13:30.570]  This is a really good question
[13:30.570 --> 13:34.370]  So the parts on the plant that we like to call hairs a lot of growers call them hairs
[13:34.370 --> 13:36.410]  Those are pistols the little dandelion parts
[13:36.490 --> 13:40.650]  That is the part of your plant which will receive the pollen the pollen will hit that little
[13:40.770 --> 13:46.010]  That little hair that's sticking up the pollen will travel down that hair and inside once it gets down to the bottom there
[13:46.010 --> 13:46.930]  It'll hit the ovule
[13:46.930 --> 13:50.050]  Inside of the bract and that is where the seed will begin to form
[13:50.050 --> 13:55.190]  Now you are right with the idea that not every plant and phenotype is going to be ready for pollen at the same time
[13:55.210 --> 13:57.610]  But it is generally between days
[13:58.090 --> 14:03.210]  18 to 23 ish all the way up to about day 32 ish depending on the plant
[14:03.210 --> 14:10.250]  I often talk about my strawberry fields and my platinum tangy plants because they want pollen at very different times
[14:10.570 --> 14:13.870]  The platinum tangy plant that I breed with is ready for pollen
[14:14.330 --> 14:18.810]  Approximately seven to ten days before that strawberry fields plant
[14:18.810 --> 14:21.970]  So it's ideal for me to stagger those two plants when I put them in the room
[14:22.030 --> 14:26.850]  So I can get them at their peak pollination times at the same time. They don't go in the same time
[14:26.850 --> 14:31.330]  So I'll put that strawberry fields plant in there on one day and then I'll wait about a week or ten days
[14:31.330 --> 14:34.210]  Then I'll drag that platinum tangy plant in there now
[14:34.210 --> 14:37.930]  They're both in flower and they will both be ready for pollen at the exact same time
[14:38.050 --> 14:40.650]  Now what you are looking for my friend as a new breeder
[14:40.810 --> 14:44.210]  Those pistols will receive pollen as soon as they begin to form
[14:44.210 --> 14:48.530]  But what I recommend is watching that plant and learning that plant you should be breeding with the plant
[14:48.530 --> 14:51.210]  You have grown several times. You've got a few great cuts in this room
[14:51.330 --> 14:57.730]  You should be watching these plants get an idea when do those pistols look the biggest the fluffiest the most available
[14:57.730 --> 15:00.290]  When are there the most of them you can tell by looking?
[15:00.570 --> 15:05.330]  The pistols are gonna start off by popping out of the buds and they're gonna get longer then they're gonna get thicker
[15:05.530 --> 15:09.930]  When they are at their longest and thickest point that is peak pollination time
[15:09.930 --> 15:12.330]  Those are the plants pollen receiving parts
[15:12.330 --> 15:13.890]  That was a lot of peas in one sentence there
[15:13.890 --> 15:18.730]  But those that is peak pollination time when those pistols are nice and ripe. You'll have to look at the plant
[15:19.090 --> 15:23.090]  There is no perfect day for pollination. You've got a nice window
[15:23.090 --> 15:26.090]  There's a nice time frame of when these plants will receive pollen
[15:26.090 --> 15:31.330]  They'll receive pollen probably all the way up from about day 17 all the way up into like day
[15:31.650 --> 15:36.210]  35 or 40 maybe even later that are able to receive pollen if there are pistols available
[15:36.210 --> 15:41.330]  They can probably receive pollen eventually those pistols dry up and weather up and they can no longer take it
[15:41.330 --> 15:44.530]  But as long as you've got pistols on there, you can pollinate them
[15:44.530 --> 15:50.930]  What you've got to do is the breeder is pay attention to those female plants and see when you've got the maximum amount of pistols
[15:51.170 --> 15:56.590]  Healthy viable pistols available. Another thing I'm gonna recommend is don't touch those pistols
[15:56.590 --> 16:01.890]  If you plan on pollinating a plant don't touch those pistols if it's with your hands with your shirt with anything
[16:01.890 --> 16:05.250]  Try not to touch them. We want them healthy and viable and active
[16:05.250 --> 16:08.490]  Also, I don't like to spray plants that I'm going to pollinate
[16:08.490 --> 16:13.050]  I feel like those sprays can disrupt those pistols and I want as many as I can have now
[16:13.050 --> 16:17.750]  I know you would like a closer number a more accurate a more precise number of when to pollinate these plants
[16:17.750 --> 16:23.010]  I'm going to say sometime between day 25 and day 32 is usually the best time
[16:23.010 --> 16:28.790]  You've got about a week window there. That is usually peak pollination time. Here's what happens if you pollinate too early
[16:28.790 --> 16:31.730]  You don't get as many seeds as you could have you could have gotten more seeds
[16:31.850 --> 16:33.850]  Here's what happens if you pollinate too late
[16:33.850 --> 16:37.670]  You don't get as many seeds as you could have if you pollinate right at the right time
[16:37.670 --> 16:40.650]  You get the maximum amount of perfect beautiful ripe seeds
[16:41.010 --> 16:42.450]  If you pollinate too early
[16:42.450 --> 16:45.450]  You're just not gonna get as many if you're making these seeds for yourself
[16:45.450 --> 16:47.890]  That will not be a problem if you pollinate too late
[16:47.890 --> 16:50.610]  It will not be a problem if you're making seeds for yourself
[16:50.610 --> 16:54.530]  If it's your first run you can put the plant in there and whenever it's got enough pistols
[16:54.530 --> 16:59.450]  You can pollinate it or you can put two plants in at the same time and they will pollinate on the right time and you
[16:59.450 --> 17:01.450]  Will make plenty of seeds to play with
[17:01.490 --> 17:07.290]  It's that second third and fourth run is when you're gonna want to learn how to dial things in and time it more perfectly so
[17:07.290 --> 17:13.890]  You can get the maximum amount of seeds I breed for production people are buying my seeds. I need the maximum amount of seeds
[17:13.970 --> 17:19.110]  That's why I drag plants in at different times and I really get the timing nailed down if you can't do that
[17:19.110 --> 17:24.210]  That's fine. Put a plant in a room put another plant in a room put some pollen on those bitches and make some seeds
[17:24.210 --> 17:30.450]  It's not as technical or hyper critical as we would like it to be this happens in nature outdoors with no control nature
[17:30.450 --> 17:34.490]  Just does it and it fucking works every year on its own. So don't stress too much
[17:34.490 --> 17:39.250]  Don't be too hyper critical about the timing fall in love with the process of breeding
[17:39.530 --> 17:45.890]  Watch when those pistols are ripe watch when that male plant starts dumping his pollen make documents make notes of both of those things
[17:45.890 --> 17:52.270]  These plants look really ready for pollen about day 23 about day 27. They kind of started looking withered up
[17:52.270 --> 17:54.530]  I should probably pollinate around day 24
[17:54.770 --> 17:59.690]  Make a note of when your male plant really make a note of when he starts dropping pollen day 14
[17:59.690 --> 18:03.310]  He started putting out pollen day 23. He was dumping by day 32
[18:03.310 --> 18:07.530]  I couldn't walk by him without pollen flying everywhere then a day 45
[18:07.530 --> 18:14.130]  He quit making pollen document that shit then do the math equation in the future and you know, I need pollen at this time
[18:14.130 --> 18:16.670]  I need fucking female plants will be ready at this time
[18:16.730 --> 18:20.170]  Do the math and get them in the room at the same time and get them going but honestly
[18:20.250 --> 18:26.430]  Like I said a moment ago, it's not hyper critical if you've got pistols and you've got pollen you will get seeds my dude
[18:26.430 --> 18:31.110]  Alright my friend Philip ong. I hope I have answered your question. This was a great question here
[18:31.110 --> 18:35.070]  Once again, please do send me your shipping info so that I can get you a free pack of
[18:35.590 --> 18:38.510]  IRI genetic seeds and I know I've said this on a couple of episodes
[18:38.510 --> 18:43.330]  But it keeps happening if you have won free seeds and you would like me to send them to you
[18:43.430 --> 18:48.190]  Please include a real name. It doesn't have to be your real name, but like a logical
[18:48.870 --> 18:52.950]  Rational name for me to put on the package. I don't want to put Philip ong on your box
[18:52.950 --> 18:54.710]  No offense to Philip ong. That's a great name
[18:54.710 --> 18:59.670]  But if you want the USPS to go through your package Philip ong is a great way to get your shit
[18:59.950 --> 19:04.830]  Investigated and cause everybody in the chain a few problems. Alright, so send me your real name, please
[19:04.830 --> 19:09.630]  I'd love to get you a free pack of seeds. Alright, I've got another great question here in front of me
[19:09.710 --> 19:16.870]  This one also did come from the grow help tab on IRI genetics comm which means my friend Scott has won a free pack of seeds
[19:16.990 --> 19:18.510]  Scott, you know the drill my dude
[19:18.510 --> 19:23.670]  Please send me your real name and your address so that I can send you a free pack of IRI genetic seeds
[19:23.790 --> 19:25.830]  This one again came from our buddy Scott
[19:25.830 --> 19:32.470]  he has a general grow question and it says I run a 6 to light schedule during veg and
[19:33.270 --> 19:38.590]  1212 during flower. Okay, so these got the lights on for six hours on and two hours off
[19:38.630 --> 19:43.310]  It sounds like during veg which sounds wonky, but I understand why that works
[19:43.310 --> 19:48.910]  I already know people are gonna be triggered by that six hours on and two hour off light schedule during veg
[19:48.910 --> 19:50.910]  They're gonna say why don't the plants go into flower?
[19:51.110 --> 19:57.430]  Because that two hour dark frame is just enough to let the plants go to sleep and then he wakes them up right before they're actually
[19:57.430 --> 19:59.790]  In the sleep mode where it would trigger them to go to flower
[19:59.790 --> 20:08.230]  I understand that then 1212 like normal and flower the question here is could I do something like six to six twelve during flower?
[20:08.670 --> 20:11.410]  Six on two off six on twelve off
[20:11.930 --> 20:18.210]  I understand the question my main answer. I wrote this on the paper. It says why why would you try to do that?
[20:18.210 --> 20:21.410]  Why do you want to do that that two hour off period is?
[20:21.970 --> 20:26.330]  Basically making your plants hungry for life. That is two hours that they could have gotten photons
[20:26.930 --> 20:33.130]  Photon energy in the plant in the room and they could have done that much more work. So over 60 days
[20:33.210 --> 20:38.610]  That's a hundred and twenty hours of photons, which you are neglecting to give these plants which they could have gotten
[20:39.090 --> 20:41.530]  Think about it this way if you are a
[20:42.450 --> 20:45.770]  Gym rat, let's just say you're going to the gym and you're trying to work out
[20:45.850 --> 20:51.890]  I'm working out two more hours a day than you every single day. So at the end of this 60 day cycle
[20:51.890 --> 20:55.950]  I've got a hundred and twenty more reps or whatever you want to call them under my belt
[20:55.950 --> 21:01.290]  My plants are gonna be stronger. My plants are gonna be bigger batter more robust because they've gotten more light
[21:01.290 --> 21:03.970]  That is my opinion and my experience
[21:04.930 --> 21:10.650]  So if you're doing six to in veg and they're not going into flower six to
[21:11.690 --> 21:13.170]  six is
[21:13.170 --> 21:15.090]  Definitely not gonna work for a flower cycle
[21:15.090 --> 21:19.810]  You're doing that basically and it's I don't I don't think that that would work for a flowering cycle
[21:19.810 --> 21:23.090]  And I don't I don't get why you want to do that
[21:23.090 --> 21:27.690]  So I guess I've got a follow-up question my dude if you really want to do this, please explain to me
[21:27.810 --> 21:31.570]  Why why do you need to do this? What is the method to your madness?
[21:31.570 --> 21:35.310]  But my quick answer is why why are we reinventing the wheel in this way?
[21:35.310 --> 21:38.970]  And I do understand that I've introduced the 18 six light cycle at the end of flower
[21:39.290 --> 21:45.890]  But I can give you a very rational and well-spoken and well thought-out reason as to why I'm doing that
[21:45.890 --> 21:50.970]  I don't see a rhyme or a reason for this new technique unless maybe the room is getting too hot
[21:50.970 --> 21:54.890]  You need to save some electricity, but there are other ways to work on that strategy
[21:54.890 --> 21:59.190]  My first answer my dude is why and then I want some follow-ups
[21:59.190 --> 22:03.190]  I want to know why you're gonna do this why that's straight up it why what you thinking bro?
[22:03.190 --> 22:06.790]  Send me a follow-up. I look forward to it, but you still get a free pack of seeds
[22:06.790 --> 22:10.310]  So, please do send me like I said a real name and a shipping address
[22:10.710 --> 22:13.070]  Alright, I've got one more question here in front of me
[22:13.070 --> 22:15.350]  We're gonna bang this one out right here at the end of the episode
[22:15.350 --> 22:20.750]  This is a quick one also came from the IRI director IRI genetics website the grow help tab
[22:20.910 --> 22:26.550]  This one came from monsoon city big up to my dude monsoon city. It says quick question
[22:26.550 --> 22:33.430]  I got some rhombus freebies a while back are those fems because I only see femme rhombus on the website
[22:33.430 --> 22:37.430]  Yes, that is correct. The rhombus is a feminized line. I have not made that in regs
[22:37.430 --> 22:39.950]  I don't think I will make reg seeds of the rhombus
[22:40.470 --> 22:44.070]  It's possible, but I don't have any plans for that at this current time
[22:44.110 --> 22:48.550]  So those are feminized seeds the website is quite accurate at this time
[22:48.550 --> 22:53.270]  I think if there's something missing on the website that you would like to see if there's a detail, please let me know
[22:53.270 --> 22:54.950]  I'm working on updating the website
[22:54.950 --> 22:58.270]  It's mostly me that does I've got a web guy that does the stuff
[22:58.270 --> 23:00.670]  But I've got to create the content and then I'll send it to him
[23:00.670 --> 23:06.470]  But if something's wonky or wrong, please let me know I will correct it. But my dude monsoon city. Those are
[23:06.990 --> 23:10.670]  Feminized seeds. Thank you for asking. Thank you for verifying. I do appreciate that
[23:11.150 --> 23:18.750]  Ladies and gentlemen boys girls pimps hoes friends foes smokers growers clone cutters pollen chuckers all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there
[23:18.750 --> 23:23.130]  I do want to thank you once again for listening to another episode of the grow from your heart podcast
[23:23.130 --> 23:26.150]  Like I said before the numbers got jumbled in my recording schedule
[23:26.170 --> 23:30.990]  So if I said the wrong number at the start of this episode or the wrong number at the start of the next episode
[23:31.050 --> 23:36.290]  Please forgive me. We've been taking dabs. You know how shit goes also we talked about that brain injury
[23:36.570 --> 23:41.370]  Sometimes things get a little bit mixed up if you have any questions corrections comments or concerns
[23:41.370 --> 23:46.290]  You know that I would love to hear from you. My email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com
