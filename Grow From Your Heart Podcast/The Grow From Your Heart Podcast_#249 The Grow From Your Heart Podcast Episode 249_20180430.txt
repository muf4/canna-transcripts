[00:16.510 --> 00:19.190]  Yeah. Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.190 --> 00:22.710]  It's time for episode number two 49 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[00:23.030 --> 00:27.030]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:27.030 --> 00:28.990]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.030 --> 00:31.110]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.450 --> 00:34.590]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the
[00:34.590 --> 00:38.190]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:38.950 --> 00:40.870]  I'm your host. My friends call me Ross to Jeff.
[00:40.990 --> 00:43.510]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:43.510 --> 00:46.630]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band
[00:46.630 --> 00:49.990]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat,
[00:50.830 --> 00:52.950]  and the entire mystic roots crew.
[00:54.950 --> 00:57.470]  Ladies and gentlemen, remember last week I was complaining about it.
[00:57.470 --> 01:01.070]  Raining for a solid week. I would like to upgrade my complaint.
[01:01.550 --> 01:04.470]  It has been raining for two solid weeks here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:05.270 --> 01:07.630]  If you're an outdoor grower here in the Southern Colorado area,
[01:08.150 --> 01:10.870]  the struggle is real this year. I feel bad for you,
[01:11.870 --> 01:15.110]  but you know where there's no struggle right here at this dab table,
[01:15.150 --> 01:16.910]  right here at this recording area. That's right.
[01:17.230 --> 01:21.230]  I am smoking some flow wax from our friends at concentrate supply company,
[01:21.750 --> 01:26.110]  uh, grown at three rivers. Of course, where I am the lead cultivator. Uh,
[01:26.110 --> 01:26.750]  if you know me,
[01:26.750 --> 01:29.950]  you know that I've got sort of a love hate relationship with the flow plant.
[01:30.470 --> 01:33.030]  Uh, I've been growing flow for probably 10 years.
[01:33.030 --> 01:37.870]  My first or second legal medical marijuana grow contained flow plants.
[01:37.910 --> 01:40.590]  That's how long I've been growing flow. It was a gift from a friend.
[01:40.590 --> 01:43.870]  I took it to the garden. I took clones of it. I flowered some out.
[01:43.870 --> 01:44.750]  I kept clones.
[01:45.030 --> 01:49.910]  I took a mother plant and I've had this flow plan around for probably 10 years.
[01:50.390 --> 01:52.430]  And I say, I've got a love hate relationship with flow.
[01:52.870 --> 01:55.390]  There's nothing wrong with flow. It's got a very unique smell.
[01:55.510 --> 01:57.990]  And that's what I love. Hate is the unique smell of flow.
[01:58.030 --> 02:01.830]  Part of flow smells amazing to me. Part of flow smells terrible to me.
[02:02.270 --> 02:05.390]  It just kind of depends on how it comes out and what part of the flowering
[02:05.410 --> 02:08.470]  period you're in. Uh, one point it smells great.
[02:08.750 --> 02:11.910]  Then it turns into this thing that I do not like. Uh,
[02:11.910 --> 02:15.110]  part of it could be because I grew it for so long that I would wake up in my
[02:15.110 --> 02:17.310]  house. My entire house would smell like flow.
[02:17.630 --> 02:20.270]  I would go to bed and my entire house would smell like flow.
[02:20.590 --> 02:23.510]  I would leave and pull up into the driveway. And when I got out of the car,
[02:23.550 --> 02:26.830]  the first thing I would smell would be flow. A lot of people are like, yeah,
[02:26.830 --> 02:29.990]  big problems, dude. But sometimes that same smell forever,
[02:30.390 --> 02:32.790]  that shit gets on your nerves and you just want to not smell it.
[02:32.790 --> 02:33.950]  And I couldn't get away from it.
[02:34.390 --> 02:37.750]  So I have like a love hate relationship with flow and I would refuse to smoke it
[02:37.750 --> 02:38.350]  for a long time.
[02:38.350 --> 02:41.470]  I'll grow the shit out of some flow because I grow for a dispensary and people
[02:41.490 --> 02:43.030]  buy the flow. So we got to have the flow.
[02:43.950 --> 02:46.590]  But flow is not my favorite to grow or smoke.
[02:47.310 --> 02:50.830]  But then I was at the dispensary and I grew this material and they said, Hey,
[02:50.830 --> 02:53.670]  we turned some of the flow into wax. Do you want to smell it?
[02:54.190 --> 02:56.710]  And I put my nose in the little jar I'm doing right now.
[02:57.950 --> 02:59.990]  And my mouth just went, yeah, I'll take a gram of that.
[03:01.110 --> 03:03.230]  And I did an episode called follow your nose.
[03:04.630 --> 03:07.270]  And I was totally correct when I smelled this, I wanted some.
[03:07.270 --> 03:09.830]  And as soon as I got home and dabbed it, I said to myself,
[03:09.830 --> 03:13.630]  you should have bought more of that because it's got a really great high to it.
[03:13.630 --> 03:16.030]  It just kinda, it kinda mellowed me out.
[03:16.070 --> 03:18.710]  A lot of dabs make me super rambly and super chatty.
[03:19.150 --> 03:21.670]  I know it sounds like I'm rambling and chatty right now because I'm doing a
[03:21.670 --> 03:24.830]  podcast by myself and I'm the only one here to talk and I'm explaining how I
[03:24.830 --> 03:28.190]  feel and shit. So I do sound rambly, but my thoughts are much slower,
[03:28.230 --> 03:31.830]  much more controlled than it would be had I smoked some Jack flash or platinum
[03:31.830 --> 03:35.910]  Tangier or something. Uh, I fits a pretty damn good high off this flow.
[03:35.910 --> 03:38.150]  I'm sitting down on my chair, nice and relaxed. I enjoy this.
[03:38.150 --> 03:40.510]  I'm nice and relaxed. I'm sitting down on my chair, nice and mellow.
[03:40.790 --> 03:42.590]  I made some solid notes here. Uh,
[03:42.910 --> 03:46.430]  they kinda de-scrambled the eggs in my brain that gets scrambled sometimes when I
[03:46.430 --> 03:47.270]  take too big of a dab.
[03:47.270 --> 03:51.790]  So great job to my friends at CSC for the great work on the flow and also a big
[03:51.790 --> 03:54.670]  shout out to all of the growers at three rivers. Yes, I am the lead cultivator.
[03:54.670 --> 03:58.230]  So I am tooting my own horn a little bit, but I am just the lead cultivator.
[03:58.230 --> 04:01.670]  There are other guys there that do a lot of hard work. I do get hot and sweaty,
[04:01.670 --> 04:03.390]  but these other guys, they bust their asses.
[04:03.390 --> 04:07.430]  So big shout out to their grow team at three rivers and big shout out to our
[04:07.430 --> 04:10.630]  friends at concentrate supply company. Of course,
[04:10.630 --> 04:12.230]  the tremors are included in all of that.
[04:12.270 --> 04:15.710]  Everybody from the gross staff to the tremors to the metric folk to the
[04:15.710 --> 04:19.270]  compliance people, shout out to everybody at three rivers. And of course at CSC,
[04:19.910 --> 04:21.710]  you know, I believe it was CSC. I'm not certain,
[04:21.710 --> 04:25.790]  but one of the concentrate companies sent us an email saying that our material
[04:26.070 --> 04:30.030]  yielded the most concentrate that they have ever gotten from a batch of
[04:30.030 --> 04:32.510]  materials. So we're doing something right at three rivers.
[04:32.510 --> 04:35.350]  We're doing something right over at CSC concentrates. Good job.
[04:35.350 --> 04:37.870]  This flow is amazing. I'm also digging the Cindy Walker,
[04:37.870 --> 04:40.150]  which is Cindy 99 with white Walker in there.
[04:40.590 --> 04:44.670]  And I've also got some blueberry headband great work, but I'm loving the flow.
[04:44.710 --> 04:45.950]  The flow is, you know,
[04:45.950 --> 04:49.870]  I think this batch of flow may have restored my faith and my fascination with
[04:49.870 --> 04:51.550]  flow. I might be back on the flow train.
[04:51.550 --> 04:55.310]  I might smoke some more flow more frequently now that I've tried this.
[04:55.870 --> 04:58.070]  All right. So let's talk about something else.
[04:58.070 --> 04:59.590]  That's cool from the grow at three rivers.
[05:00.030 --> 05:02.390]  We have to lab test everything that we grow.
[05:02.750 --> 05:07.590]  Everything that we grow is tested for potency and it's also tested for molds
[05:07.590 --> 05:09.870]  and yeast. It's a microbial testing.
[05:10.390 --> 05:13.190]  So we sent everything out before it can be sold at the store.
[05:13.190 --> 05:15.350]  It all has to be sent out. Then it all has to be tested.
[05:15.350 --> 05:17.870]  The results have to come back. Then we can sell it.
[05:18.590 --> 05:21.910]  The test results for some of our strains have come back pretty impressive
[05:21.910 --> 05:22.550]  lately.
[05:22.550 --> 05:27.270]  And I want to brag about our 31% THC test result on presidential
[05:27.310 --> 05:31.350]  cush. We did not breed the presidential cush. That is not my project of breeding,
[05:31.550 --> 05:35.950]  but we did grow it and we tested at 31% THC.
[05:35.950 --> 05:38.590]  I'm pretty proud of that. Uh, that's a pretty good number.
[05:38.590 --> 05:41.430]  Most strains that you're going to find in a dispensary,
[05:41.830 --> 05:45.470]  they hover somewhere between the 22 to like 29 is high.
[05:45.470 --> 05:49.550]  27 is kind of where you're going to find a mostly 22 to 27 in that range.
[05:49.910 --> 05:53.870]  If you get over 30, that's impressive. 31 is super impressive. Uh,
[05:53.910 --> 05:56.150]  the highest that we have seen is 35.
[05:56.630 --> 05:59.870]  I don't think I've ever seen a higher test, which was of course the arise,
[06:00.190 --> 06:04.390]  the tested at 35 and a fraction that was grown at Organica that was bred by
[06:04.390 --> 06:07.190]  myself. Um, so yeah,
[06:07.190 --> 06:12.190]  I just wanted to brag on our whole crew and our genetics and the Janie tech that
[06:12.270 --> 06:13.950]  we're using over at three rivers.
[06:14.670 --> 06:18.510]  We got an official lab result at 31.6%. You know,
[06:18.510 --> 06:21.110]  back in the day we got a test from our ecto cooler strain.
[06:21.110 --> 06:23.750]  There was a little higher than that, but everybody thought that it was a fluke.
[06:23.830 --> 06:27.590]  So everybody kind of dismissed that and we're just going to celebrate the 31%.
[06:28.070 --> 06:32.430]  We're going to take this 31.6 seriously and we're going to brag about this one.
[06:32.550 --> 06:35.310]  So a big shout out to everybody at three rivers. Uh, let's see,
[06:35.310 --> 06:37.470]  what do I want to touch on next? You know what I got to do?
[06:37.470 --> 06:40.190]  I got to remind you that this podcast is brought to you by our friends at the
[06:40.190 --> 06:44.110]  dank team. That's right. If you need to add some new genetics to your lineup,
[06:44.150 --> 06:46.190]  if you need some regular or feminized seeds,
[06:46.190 --> 06:49.070]  check out my friends at the dank team.com that's right.
[06:49.070 --> 06:53.150]  The dank team.com carries brands like alpha chronic mile high sin city can
[06:53.150 --> 06:56.150]  venture, I read genetics, the Cali connection, DNA genetics,
[06:56.510 --> 06:58.390]  and many more trusted brands.
[06:58.630 --> 07:02.510]  So make sure you check out the dank team.com and let them know you're listening
[07:02.510 --> 07:07.190]  to the grow from your heart podcast. All right. Speaking of new seeds,
[07:07.390 --> 07:10.070]  let's talk about my most current breeding project.
[07:10.070 --> 07:13.350]  That's right on the first of this month. I started a new breeding project.
[07:13.350 --> 07:14.750]  I put a few plants into flower.
[07:14.990 --> 07:19.310]  I'm running one light in a very small room with a very small amount of plants.
[07:19.710 --> 07:22.550]  Let's see what's in there. I've got a chem four. There is a rise.
[07:23.110 --> 07:26.670]  There are two different phenotypes of arise, arise number E and arise number eight.
[07:26.870 --> 07:29.470]  There's an Ecto cooler in there. There's strawberry fields.
[07:29.750 --> 07:33.110]  We've got a kosher cush. There's a flow. There's a grateful dog.
[07:33.230 --> 07:37.230]  There's a Zach Hayes space bitch. And of course, hell's OG.
[07:37.230 --> 07:38.590]  They're all in the breeding room together.
[07:38.790 --> 07:41.990]  They're all going to get hit with pollen from my arise mail.
[07:42.070 --> 07:45.910]  That arise mail is known as King Solomon. Let's see the chem four.
[07:46.030 --> 07:49.830]  I've made chem four seeds before with Solomon. They don't have a name.
[07:50.150 --> 07:53.150]  I only made about 30 of those. So I never let any of those out arise.
[07:53.190 --> 07:57.670]  Ian arise eight of course will make arise F two seeds Ecto cooler.
[07:57.670 --> 08:01.310]  I have never bred the Ecto cooler to the arise before,
[08:01.510 --> 08:04.270]  but I'm thinking is going to happen is we're going to get really tall,
[08:04.470 --> 08:09.350]  really dense, really stinky, really resin covered buds with a very unique flavor.
[08:09.350 --> 08:13.670]  The Ecto cooler has a very unique flavor. The arise has its own pungent smell.
[08:13.910 --> 08:16.870]  I think when you mix the two, we're going to find some great progeny.
[08:17.430 --> 08:18.870]  The strawberry fields is in there.
[08:19.150 --> 08:22.430]  Strawberry fields has a very strawberry candy light kind of smell,
[08:22.430 --> 08:26.110]  kind of a soft hint of a strawberry incense sort of a thing.
[08:26.390 --> 08:31.110]  I think we'll create some really tall tropical flavored strawberry type sativa
[08:31.110 --> 08:35.070]  buds. The kosher kush is in there. Kosher kush from DNA genetics.
[08:35.310 --> 08:38.950]  It's a great cut of kosher kush. My goal with the kosher kush cross,
[08:39.630 --> 08:41.550]  the kosher doesn't put out a lot of weight.
[08:41.590 --> 08:43.710]  It produces a bunch of really small buds.
[08:43.990 --> 08:46.830]  I'm hoping maybe we can increase the yields on the kosher kush.
[08:47.430 --> 08:50.950]  Maybe put a little more funk into it. Kosher is already a great strain,
[08:50.950 --> 08:54.630]  but I think adding it to a rise, we're going to increase the production,
[08:54.830 --> 08:58.350]  just making an overall plant altogether. Flow is in there.
[08:58.590 --> 09:01.950]  Flow makes when you cross flow to a rise that makes a stream called prana.
[09:02.390 --> 09:05.790]  Prana is an indica sativa hybrid with a very unique aroma.
[09:06.070 --> 09:08.030]  The smells that come out of that plant are amazing.
[09:08.630 --> 09:12.710]  It produces big fat chunky colas. What's next? The grateful dog.
[09:13.590 --> 09:17.190]  When you cross grateful dog to an arise male that creates a plant called the
[09:17.210 --> 09:18.110]  morning dew.
[09:18.590 --> 09:23.190]  Morning dew is as close to grateful dog as I have released in regular seeds.
[09:23.230 --> 09:25.990]  A long time ago, I released grateful dog and feminized seeds.
[09:26.630 --> 09:28.310]  It quickly became very popular,
[09:28.390 --> 09:31.910]  but I quickly sold out because I am not making more feminized seeds for a long
[09:31.910 --> 09:34.550]  time. There's no plan in my future to make feminized seeds.
[09:34.790 --> 09:38.590]  So that morning dew was as close to the grateful dog that I have put out in a
[09:38.590 --> 09:42.030]  regular seed. What else do we have on the list here? Zach Hayes.
[09:42.310 --> 09:43.670]  Let me tell you about Zach Hayes.
[09:43.990 --> 09:47.950]  Zach Hayes is strawberry cough crossed to killer queen.
[09:48.630 --> 09:51.870]  And it was made for our friend Zach Hayes from New Mexico,
[09:51.890 --> 09:54.830]  who was part of the Organtica dispensary. Zach Hayes,
[09:54.830 --> 09:58.870]  unfortunately passed of cystic fibrosis. So he had a strain named after him.
[09:59.150 --> 10:02.590]  Long live Zach. I'm going to cross the arise to Zach Hayes.
[10:02.990 --> 10:07.030]  Hopefully I can get those available for you at Organtica in Albuquerque.
[10:07.030 --> 10:09.670]  So if you're a medical marijuana patient, or if you knew Zach,
[10:09.990 --> 10:13.150]  there will be a way for you to get your hands on the Zach Hayes seeds.
[10:13.510 --> 10:16.710]  Big up to Zach. Much love miss a little buddy. All right.
[10:16.710 --> 10:18.350]  What else do we have in the room? Space bitch.
[10:18.590 --> 10:21.950]  Space bitch is my cross of grateful dog to space queen.
[10:22.270 --> 10:26.510]  I took my favorite space queen female and I pollinated it with the grateful dog
[10:26.550 --> 10:30.790]  feminized pollen. This was made years and years ago, and I never released it.
[10:30.810 --> 10:33.110]  I kept this one to myself. Um, it,
[10:33.590 --> 10:35.870]  it basically almost every plant that I grew from there,
[10:35.890 --> 10:38.150]  it came out very similar to space queen.
[10:38.150 --> 10:40.070]  It looks like I just made a space queen cross.
[10:40.470 --> 10:42.270]  It didn't show much grateful dog in there.
[10:42.470 --> 10:46.870]  I'm hoping to kind of mix that weird mango funky flavor that space queen creates
[10:46.870 --> 10:50.550]  with that gassy, funky, tropical thing that arise has.
[10:50.790 --> 10:52.630]  And I'm really curious what that's going to do.
[10:52.870 --> 10:57.630]  The space queen stays short and squat or the space bitch stays short and squat
[10:57.630 --> 11:01.430]  and branches out a whole bunch arise likes to grow real tall and is real branchy.
[11:01.430 --> 11:06.430]  So I may have created a beefy ass plant with a bunch of stink. All right.
[11:06.430 --> 11:07.990]  What else is in there? Hell's OG.
[11:08.230 --> 11:11.990]  I've crossed hell's OG to arise before and that makes a strain called hellfire.
[11:11.990 --> 11:15.550]  OG since it starts off with an OG cush as a mother,
[11:15.790 --> 11:17.470]  that female puts that really,
[11:17.830 --> 11:21.270]  it just gets a lot of the hell's OG fuel and funk and dakeness.
[11:21.550 --> 11:25.070]  And then you put the arise in there, which is golden goat and daybreaker. Now,
[11:25.270 --> 11:26.630]  we're going to, I'm going to go back a little bit.
[11:26.630 --> 11:29.710]  Daybreaker is chem D and Joseph OG.
[11:30.030 --> 11:34.110]  So I'm putting chem D Joseph OG and golden goat to another cush plant.
[11:34.110 --> 11:38.630]  It's bringing out a lot of great cushy undertones and some have like a lemon
[11:38.630 --> 11:41.190]  cush. Some of them are real greasy.
[11:41.670 --> 11:44.150]  Some have a smell of like lemon pledge with cush on it.
[11:44.150 --> 11:45.550]  And then some have like a weird,
[11:45.790 --> 11:49.830]  it reminds me of like lava soap or some kind of soap that I can't quite put my
[11:49.870 --> 11:53.310]  nose on, but it's got a great aroma to it. Uh,
[11:53.350 --> 11:56.430]  my goal was the hell's OG does not produce very well. It's kind of a tall,
[11:56.430 --> 11:58.750]  lanky, skinny, shitty plant, like a lot of OGs.
[11:59.070 --> 12:02.550]  And the arise is just a stocky, really robust plant.
[12:02.830 --> 12:06.070]  Everything that breeds to that comes out with more production.
[12:06.070 --> 12:07.790]  So I'm trying to increase the production,
[12:07.790 --> 12:10.630]  increase the structure of the hell's OG and it is working.
[12:10.870 --> 12:13.150]  So that's, what's in the breeding project right now.
[12:13.150 --> 12:15.390]  All of those will of course be hit by the arise male.
[12:16.070 --> 12:18.230]  They are only seven or eight days into flower right now.
[12:18.390 --> 12:21.710]  They need about 21 to 25 days to get into bloom before I'll hit them with
[12:21.710 --> 12:22.910]  pollen. Then from there,
[12:22.910 --> 12:26.230]  they're going to need five to eight weeks for those seeds to harden up.
[12:26.230 --> 12:29.750]  I'll go pull seeds occasionally from certain plants and see if they look like
[12:29.750 --> 12:32.510]  they're ready. The flow finishes really quickly. Those seeds come on,
[12:32.510 --> 12:34.550]  quick for some reason, the hell's OG,
[12:34.550 --> 12:37.350]  those seeds seem to take a really long time to harden up.
[12:37.670 --> 12:40.190]  So it's all about the plant. It's all about timing things.
[12:40.790 --> 12:44.430]  It's all about having a goal and it's all about paying attention to what's going
[12:44.430 --> 12:46.430]  on. So if you're going to breed, have a goal.
[12:46.470 --> 12:49.390]  Don't just throw some plants in there. Have an idea what you're going to do.
[12:49.630 --> 12:52.430]  Know what you want to create. Anyway, that's a look into my breeding room.
[12:52.550 --> 12:56.910]  Thanks for joining me. Uh, let's see, what do we want to move on to next?
[12:57.590 --> 13:01.150]  Let's read a message from a listener. If you listened to the episode last week,
[13:01.390 --> 13:04.750]  I talked about how to talk about cannabis with your kids,
[13:04.750 --> 13:07.110]  how to address your cannabis use with your children.
[13:07.430 --> 13:11.150]  A lot of you live in places where dare is trying to set your kids up to snitch
[13:11.150 --> 13:13.910]  on you. I think that if you hide your cannabis use,
[13:13.950 --> 13:15.350]  it looks like you're up to something.
[13:15.630 --> 13:18.510]  I think if you talk to your kids about it and tell them what's going on,
[13:18.790 --> 13:22.150]  you have built an honest relationship with your family and there's no reason to
[13:22.150 --> 13:25.630]  hide shit. When you hide things, it makes you look like you're hiding something.
[13:26.190 --> 13:28.710]  You might be acting just a little bit differently because you're hiding
[13:28.710 --> 13:32.030]  something and the kids are so receptive that they're going to see you acting
[13:32.030 --> 13:34.790]  differently and they're going to know you're hiding something. So don't hide shit.
[13:34.830 --> 13:38.470]  Don't lie to the kids. When you hide things, you have to lie. When you lie,
[13:38.470 --> 13:40.750]  you have to lie again. Then you have to hide that line.
[13:40.750 --> 13:43.630]  Then you got to lie again and it's just a fucking shitty web and you don't want
[13:43.630 --> 13:46.590]  to start that with your children. Tell the children the truth. Anyway,
[13:47.390 --> 13:50.670]  a listener sent me an email and I don't know if they want their name set on the
[13:50.670 --> 13:53.870]  air, so I'm going to keep that private, but he knows who he is. And Hey bro,
[13:53.870 --> 13:55.790]  we need to sesh soon. I know you live in Colorado.
[13:55.790 --> 13:58.430]  I know you're kind of far from me, but we do need to get together and sesh.
[13:58.710 --> 14:01.790]  Also brother great work on the drum videos on Instagram.
[14:01.790 --> 14:04.510]  I see you playing the drum videos. I'm a drummer too.
[14:04.510 --> 14:07.390]  So we need to get together and sesh and play a little bit of drums.
[14:07.710 --> 14:10.990]  Are you bringing your drum kit to me or am I bringing my drum kit to you?
[14:10.990 --> 14:15.310]  That's the question. Anyway, let's get into this message. It goes like this.
[14:16.070 --> 14:18.950]  Thanks for making people aware of the wretched MED background check.
[14:18.990 --> 14:21.350]  It's kept my family struggling since we've moved here.
[14:21.430 --> 14:24.390]  I'm still trying to find a good lawyer to file suit with the MED.
[14:24.510 --> 14:26.590]  I really think the 10 years is ludicrous.
[14:26.750 --> 14:30.670]  It ruins the chance of any young felons getting a badge 10 years from the moment
[14:30.670 --> 14:35.510]  you turn 18 is 28. So anyone with any charge under 28 are out of the industry.
[14:35.870 --> 14:38.750]  Then if it's 10 years from that, it puts you at 38 years old.
[14:38.790 --> 14:43.230]  If that makes any sense. Now at one time they didn't allow felons at all.
[14:43.510 --> 14:47.310]  Someone filed a complaint and a lawsuit and they changed it to 10 years.
[14:47.550 --> 14:50.990]  I believe if they changed it to 10, I can get them to change it to five,
[14:51.190 --> 14:54.870]  allowing me and thousands of other others that are stuck on welfare in Colorado.
[14:55.190 --> 14:57.550]  I think he's saying that would allow them to get a job in the industry,
[14:57.870 --> 15:01.590]  which would be taxpaying citizens with a badge. I know I'm preaching to the choir,
[15:01.830 --> 15:05.150]  but you, if, if you have any lawyer suggestions, I would appreciate it.
[15:05.190 --> 15:08.190]  The recent parent podcast was great. Okay.
[15:08.190 --> 15:10.790]  So now I just caught up to the part about the last episode.
[15:10.910 --> 15:14.550]  So I've mentioned on an episode that you should find out if you can get a
[15:14.550 --> 15:18.110]  marijuana enforcement division badge before you move to Colorado.
[15:18.190 --> 15:21.390]  If you want to work in the legal marijuana industry in Colorado,
[15:21.630 --> 15:22.830]  you have to get a badge.
[15:22.870 --> 15:26.950]  You cannot come into a facility without a marijuana enforcement division badge.
[15:27.310 --> 15:30.150]  You can't touch product. You can't do damn near anything.
[15:30.150 --> 15:33.910]  You are a visitor without that badge. So to get that,
[15:33.910 --> 15:36.110]  you have to pass a thorough background check.
[15:36.390 --> 15:39.310]  There are a lot of things that could screw you on getting that badge.
[15:39.310 --> 15:43.070]  If you've got a felony within the last 10 years, or if you've got a drug crime,
[15:43.270 --> 15:45.030]  there are a lot of things that can really mess that up.
[15:45.030 --> 15:47.590]  I don't remember all of the specifics. I'm not going to search right now,
[15:47.870 --> 15:51.310]  but if you are planning on coming to Colorado to work in the cannabis industry,
[15:51.590 --> 15:54.750]  go to the Colorado marijuana enforcement division website and see,
[15:54.990 --> 15:58.310]  or if you are even eligible for a badge, there's a list of things.
[15:58.630 --> 16:02.270]  That's about 10 or 12 bullet points. And it says, do any of these apply to you?
[16:02.270 --> 16:03.790]  And if you say yes to any of those,
[16:04.310 --> 16:07.590]  there is a good possibility you are banned from working in the marijuana
[16:07.590 --> 16:11.670]  industry for the time being until your time period comes up or until you can get
[16:11.670 --> 16:13.790]  a lawyer to fix all of that shit for you.
[16:13.990 --> 16:16.950]  So be careful if you're coming to Colorado, that's what he's talking about.
[16:17.270 --> 16:21.270]  This guy wants to find a lawyer to help him file a suit against the MED and the
[16:21.270 --> 16:24.350]  state of Colorado to reduce the tenure period to five.
[16:24.350 --> 16:25.750]  So if anybody out there is a lawyer,
[16:25.790 --> 16:29.350]  anybody wants to lawyer up and help this guy send me a message at grow from your
[16:29.350 --> 16:32.550]  heart at hotmail.com and I will connect you guys and you can get,
[16:32.590 --> 16:36.030]  you guys can start working on this and get more people able to work in the
[16:36.030 --> 16:39.110]  industry. Now here's the part of the message where he talks about,
[16:39.150 --> 16:43.390]  we talk about children. He said, the recent parent podcast was great.
[16:43.630 --> 16:47.590]  We had social service called on us in Kentucky. Sorry,
[16:47.590 --> 16:49.110]  I'm scrolling through the message. There we go.
[16:49.110 --> 16:52.350]  We had social services called on us in Kentucky over moving here.
[16:52.710 --> 16:56.790]  They came in and evaluated me and my wife and concluded that if we did use
[16:56.790 --> 17:00.710]  cannabis, it was not affecting our children in any way. We were very lucky.
[17:00.710 --> 17:04.030]  It could have gone badly. More people need to educate the kids,
[17:04.030 --> 17:08.470]  hell educate the whole country. Cheers. Thanks for the show.
[17:09.150 --> 17:10.910]  Hey brother, you're very welcome for the podcast.
[17:10.950 --> 17:13.510]  Thank you for the great message. Thanks for reaching out to me.
[17:13.510 --> 17:16.270]  I did ask for input on the last podcast. I said, Hey,
[17:16.270 --> 17:17.790]  if you've got some input on this, let me know.
[17:17.910 --> 17:19.630]  So hearing back from you is great. Thank you.
[17:19.910 --> 17:23.430]  I'm glad I was able to remind people to check on the med badge before they come
[17:23.430 --> 17:26.710]  here. And I'm glad I've got people thinking about keeping the kids safe.
[17:26.910 --> 17:30.070]  You guys, Babylon is out there programming your kids to snitch on you.
[17:30.070 --> 17:33.790]  The dare program wants your kids to snitch on you. Be very careful. Hey,
[17:33.790 --> 17:37.070]  thanks for the message, dude. I hope we get to sesh sometime soon.
[17:37.310 --> 17:39.830]  Maybe we can meet up in the Springs or something. All right,
[17:39.830 --> 17:42.270]  I've got another message I want to read that came from Instagram.
[17:42.430 --> 17:46.390]  It goes like this Rasta Jeff. Hey buddy, no names. If you read this, anyhow,
[17:46.390 --> 17:49.150]  I can't get enough of your real grow. No BS approach.
[17:49.150 --> 17:52.190]  I've learned a lot from you and you're helping me to make some incredible
[17:52.190 --> 17:54.830]  medicine. I quit drinking alcohol almost two years ago.
[17:55.070 --> 17:59.310]  Quit taking pharmaceuticals for back pain and anxiety and quit smoking cigs
[17:59.310 --> 18:02.870]  about 10 months ago. Thanks to cannabis. Congratulations, man.
[18:02.870 --> 18:04.990]  That's fucking awesome. Alcohol is terrible.
[18:04.990 --> 18:07.190]  Pharmaceuticals are terrible and cigarettes are the devil.
[18:07.190 --> 18:09.190]  So I'm proud of you for quitting. And man,
[18:09.390 --> 18:12.670]  I'm glad I'm helping you grow good cannabis to get away from that stuff and take
[18:12.670 --> 18:16.270]  better care of yourself. The message keeps going. And it says like this,
[18:16.270 --> 18:19.590]  I don't use iTunes or I'd give you a well-written five-star review. Hey,
[18:19.590 --> 18:22.750]  thank you, man. That still means a lot to me. He says, consider this.
[18:22.750 --> 18:25.830]  I digress. I'm high on some homegrown Jack Herro right now.
[18:27.070 --> 18:29.830]  I wish Jack had a higher CBD content as it is.
[18:29.830 --> 18:32.550]  I find it to be a wonderful medicine in certain areas.
[18:32.790 --> 18:35.910]  Have you ever bred with Jack? Um, I haven't bred with Jack,
[18:35.910 --> 18:38.630]  but I've read with Jack flash. I haven't grown the seeds out yet.
[18:38.630 --> 18:40.990]  And then he goes on to say, or can you recommend a strain?
[18:40.990 --> 18:44.710]  Very similar to Jack, but with a heavier CBD medical side,
[18:44.950 --> 18:48.150]  I highly respect your opinion. That's why I'm reaching out to you directly.
[18:48.350 --> 18:50.030]  Too much conflicting info out there.
[18:50.470 --> 18:54.310]  I'll let Jesse know that his simple act of liking a few of my photos gave me a
[18:54.310 --> 18:56.910]  lot of confidence that I'm doing something right. Hey,
[18:56.910 --> 18:59.030]  that's pretty cool that Jesse likes your photos on Instagram.
[18:59.190 --> 19:03.270]  You are definitely doing something right now as for conflicting information.
[19:03.310 --> 19:06.110]  That's why I do this podcast. I wanted to write a book.
[19:06.110 --> 19:09.070]  I realized that a book would evolve almost every week in the new cannabis
[19:09.070 --> 19:09.910]  industry.
[19:10.150 --> 19:12.710]  And then I also knew that there was a bunch of bullshit out there on the forums
[19:12.710 --> 19:14.310]  that was making people ruin their grows.
[19:14.470 --> 19:17.790]  So I wanted to put out a way to teach people how to grow with,
[19:17.790 --> 19:20.190]  just like you said in the beginning, with no bullshit, with no jokes,
[19:20.190 --> 19:21.030]  with no tricks,
[19:21.110 --> 19:26.070]  with tried and true methods that actually work in a home grows and large scale
[19:26.070 --> 19:29.830]  horticulture. So, uh, thanks for the compliments there. Now let's talk about,
[19:30.070 --> 19:34.750]  uh, strains that are similar to Jack, but are a little bit higher in CBD.
[19:35.510 --> 19:39.150]  Now a strain that may surprise people that often has a lot of CBD in it is
[19:39.150 --> 19:42.590]  Alaskan Thunderfuck. Alaskan Thunderfuck is thought of as a sativa.
[19:42.670 --> 19:45.510]  It grows really tall, uh, reaching colas.
[19:45.790 --> 19:49.150]  It has like a really nice minty sandalwood sort of a flavor.
[19:49.150 --> 19:50.950]  It kind of depends on where you get it and who grew it,
[19:50.950 --> 19:52.910]  but it acts more like a sativa.
[19:52.910 --> 19:56.710]  But I have seen test results from Alaskan Thunderfuck that have tested,
[19:56.990 --> 20:01.310]  tested with impressive CBD numbers. Another strain I think you may like,
[20:01.350 --> 20:05.350]  maybe Pennywise. Uh, Pennywise is a kind of a sativa growing plant.
[20:05.350 --> 20:09.230]  It's got a nice sativa high, but it's also got plenty of CBD in there.
[20:09.950 --> 20:15.190]  Now another really popular high CBD strain is ACDC. ACDC has a lot of CBD,
[20:15.190 --> 20:17.830]  but it's also got THC. It's going to give you a nice head buzz,
[20:17.830 --> 20:21.350]  but you're also going to get that relief. You're not going to get bogged down.
[20:22.270 --> 20:26.870]  A couple of other really popular CBD crosses are Harlequin and Canna Tonic.
[20:26.870 --> 20:28.950]  You can find those quite often in Colorado.
[20:28.950 --> 20:30.990]  I'm not sure if they are available in your area.
[20:31.510 --> 20:34.270]  Many of the strains I listed are available in seed form.
[20:34.270 --> 20:37.270]  You can probably find some of them at thedankteam.com.
[20:37.270 --> 20:38.790]  I can't guarantee what they've got.
[20:39.070 --> 20:43.510]  One thing that I have noticed is in my opinion, CBD works better as an edible.
[20:43.510 --> 20:46.790]  I find it to be more effective. Smoking CBD comes on quickly,
[20:46.790 --> 20:49.230]  but it doesn't last very long in my opinion.
[20:49.990 --> 20:52.910]  Maybe something you might want to consider. Keep growing the jack,
[20:53.030 --> 20:54.110]  keep smoking the jack,
[20:54.350 --> 20:58.390]  but maybe add a little bit of CBD edible or CBD tincture to your regimen.
[20:58.670 --> 21:01.150]  And that may be the way to go to help with the relief.
[21:01.670 --> 21:05.710]  If you want to go extreme and grow a plant that is really heavy in CBD and won't
[21:05.710 --> 21:10.390]  do much on the THC side, I would recommend Tora Bora from DNA Genetics.
[21:10.790 --> 21:14.230]  It's not the best plant to grow. It does not produce very well,
[21:14.910 --> 21:19.910]  but it does put out very good CBD medicine. It'll have a nice cherry flavor.
[21:20.390 --> 21:23.990]  It'll have kind of a cushy aroma and the CBD effects are very strong.
[21:23.990 --> 21:26.910]  So that's Tora Bora from DNA Genetics. All right.
[21:27.070 --> 21:29.870]  I want to thank you for the message. You said not to say your name, but uh,
[21:29.910 --> 21:32.350]  Hey, thanks. I'm going to go follow you on Instagram right now.
[21:33.030 --> 21:35.710]  And I would like to know if you find some medicine that works a little bit
[21:35.710 --> 21:38.350]  better for you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to send me a message,
[21:38.350 --> 21:42.310]  the best way to do it is to email me at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[21:42.310 --> 21:45.990]  I'd love to hear from you. I would love to read your messages on the show.
[21:46.110 --> 21:49.550]  Let's get into one more email before we wrap up this episode.
[21:50.390 --> 21:52.430]  This email goes like this. It says, what's up?
[21:52.430 --> 21:55.110]  Just started listening to your podcast and I've learned a lot.
[21:55.310 --> 21:58.110]  Thanks for doing the podcast for us. Hey, you're very welcome.
[21:58.510 --> 21:59.430]  The email goes on to say,
[21:59.430 --> 22:02.350]  I listened to your Sea of Green episode and got some great info.
[22:02.590 --> 22:05.790]  I'm planning on using the Scrog tech since my space is very limited.
[22:06.150 --> 22:08.550]  I recall you saying that you use this method as well.
[22:08.790 --> 22:12.630]  I'd love to hear another more in-depth episode on your methods. Pot size,
[22:12.670 --> 22:15.750]  transplant before flower and plants per square foot.
[22:16.150 --> 22:19.670]  I'm planning on growing Cindy 99 using the True Living Organics method.
[22:19.910 --> 22:24.310]  The RevCell C99F4 that he says work good with this growing method.
[22:24.350 --> 22:26.190]  That should work pretty well in that method, by the way.
[22:26.670 --> 22:30.550]  Any tips for small grow spaces? Thanks and keep it up.
[22:31.230 --> 22:31.350]  Well,
[22:31.350 --> 22:35.310]  I'm not going to do a whole long episode on Scrogging again because I kind of
[22:35.330 --> 22:37.230]  covered most of it in that first episode.
[22:37.630 --> 22:40.110]  Let me get right to the point with your questions.
[22:40.110 --> 22:42.630]  You said you want to know more about pot size.
[22:42.950 --> 22:45.550]  Now since you're doing a small area, you actually included your area.
[22:45.550 --> 22:48.390]  You say that it's a two by three and a half by eight.
[22:48.630 --> 22:51.590]  So you've got two feet wide, three and a half feet deep and eight feet tall.
[22:51.750 --> 22:53.310]  That's not a lot of space to work with,
[22:53.310 --> 22:55.430]  but that's plenty of space for a small light.
[22:55.430 --> 22:57.110]  Maybe you've got a 400 watt light in there.
[22:57.110 --> 22:58.710]  Hopefully you've got some airflow in there.
[22:58.950 --> 23:02.630]  Maybe you've got a 600 watt light with a whole lot of airflow. That's up to you.
[23:02.910 --> 23:06.070]  But pot size in a space that small,
[23:06.750 --> 23:08.510]  I would probably do two or three,
[23:08.590 --> 23:13.590]  three gallon pots and just spread them out really far or maybe do one five
[23:13.630 --> 23:16.510]  gallon pot. If it even fits in there, that's going to be a tight fit.
[23:16.830 --> 23:19.990]  If you can get those square pots, one five gallon pot in there would fit,
[23:20.230 --> 23:21.350]  spread it down real,
[23:21.350 --> 23:24.270]  real low and just keep that plant as short as you can get it.
[23:24.270 --> 23:27.670]  Every time it grows up, bend it back under that trellis net and keep it low.
[23:28.150 --> 23:30.390]  Another thing you can do if you want to go smaller pots,
[23:30.390 --> 23:34.670]  you can do more plants in smaller pots and you don't have to veg as long.
[23:34.710 --> 23:38.990]  The thing with more plants is you have less veg time with less plants.
[23:39.030 --> 23:40.350]  It takes more veg time.
[23:40.350 --> 23:43.150]  You're just going to grow one plant longer to fill the space or you'll grow more
[23:43.170 --> 23:46.710]  plants for shorter to fill the space. So if you want to do rock,
[23:46.710 --> 23:48.830]  wool cubes, do like the four inch rock,
[23:48.830 --> 23:52.230]  wool cubes, maybe do one, two, three, like four,
[23:52.430 --> 23:53.790]  do maybe like 16 rock,
[23:53.790 --> 23:58.790]  wool cubes in the whole room or maybe do like 12 or nine four inch square pots
[24:01.270 --> 24:05.230]  or nine six inch net pots. It kind of depends on how often you want to water,
[24:05.430 --> 24:09.030]  how many plants you want to run, how many plants are you legally allowed to run?
[24:09.110 --> 24:12.110]  Is this an illegal grow? There are things like that to think about.
[24:12.110 --> 24:13.950]  So in your space I would say two or three,
[24:13.950 --> 24:18.350]  three gallon pots or a whole bunch of little ones, transplant before a flower.
[24:19.230 --> 24:19.750]  Like I said,
[24:19.750 --> 24:22.670]  just put them into the three gallon pots or maybe one five gallon pot.
[24:22.870 --> 24:26.710]  Use a good aerated soil. Use a quality soil mix. Use good nutrients.
[24:27.190 --> 24:30.470]  Plants per square foot that see that's kind of up to you. If you just,
[24:30.470 --> 24:33.110]  like I was saying earlier, if you want to do a whole bunch of little ones,
[24:33.150 --> 24:36.870]  you could do like 30 little tiny rock,
[24:36.870 --> 24:39.630]  wool cubes or you could do 16 bigger rock,
[24:39.630 --> 24:43.910]  wool cubes or like nine six inch net pots or three,
[24:43.950 --> 24:48.590]  three gallon pots or one five gallon pot or maybe one seven gallon pot would fit
[24:48.590 --> 24:49.430]  in there.
[24:49.750 --> 24:52.350]  What this is going to do is it's going to make a difference on how frequently
[24:52.350 --> 24:53.190]  you have to water.
[24:53.310 --> 24:56.710]  It's going to make a difference on how long you have to veg and it's going to
[24:56.710 --> 24:58.790]  make a difference on how many plants you have in there.
[24:58.910 --> 25:01.270]  Those are some of the things to consider when you're deciding this.
[25:01.470 --> 25:04.030]  So I feel like I may have kind of just told you, figure it out,
[25:04.310 --> 25:06.710]  but you kind of have to figure this part out.
[25:06.750 --> 25:09.230]  That's something you're going to have to decide. Do you want to veg longer?
[25:09.390 --> 25:11.910]  Do you want to veg shorter? Do you want one big plant?
[25:11.910 --> 25:13.190]  Do you want multiple strains?
[25:13.950 --> 25:16.910]  That's one of the fun parts about cannabis is that you have a little wiggle room.
[25:16.910 --> 25:19.750]  There are no solid rules on what you've got to do. Okay.
[25:19.750 --> 25:21.270]  What I would probably do, I'm looking at it,
[25:21.270 --> 25:22.710]  I'm trying to picture this size of space.
[25:22.950 --> 25:27.030]  I think I would do four three gallon pots and I would be sure to do all the same
[25:27.030 --> 25:31.150]  strain. I would grow them up about like until they have a few nodes,
[25:31.150 --> 25:34.030]  you know, when they start making that node where the one starts taking off at
[25:34.030 --> 25:36.390]  the top, I would top them, take that main top node out of there.
[25:36.390 --> 25:37.790]  Now you've got a nice even plant.
[25:38.150 --> 25:40.590]  I would start trellising them out then and spread them out real wide.
[25:40.590 --> 25:44.070]  Now you've got four plants that are probably like 10 inches tall.
[25:44.350 --> 25:46.310]  They're nice and bushy. Put them under the screen.
[25:46.670 --> 25:50.110]  Get that screen set up about 10 or 12 inches above the top of the pot and just
[25:50.110 --> 25:51.790]  start spreading them out as wide as you can.
[25:52.070 --> 25:55.710]  Instead of letting that plant grow up, make it grow out and then let it go up.
[25:55.710 --> 25:57.830]  From there. And then if you have another screen up,
[25:57.830 --> 26:01.190]  you can use the next screen to support all the buds that you're going to create.
[26:01.310 --> 26:02.350]  Cause they'll start falling over.
[26:02.550 --> 26:05.750]  Use the next one as like little supports for them. So when they start tipping,
[26:05.750 --> 26:09.350]  you just have this little, little rows of buds everywhere. It'll look beautiful.
[26:09.550 --> 26:12.990]  So I hope I gave you useful information. I know I just told you, figure it out,
[26:13.150 --> 26:15.390]  do what you feel best with, but I would do four,
[26:15.390 --> 26:19.030]  three gallon pots and put the net about 10 or 12 inches above the pot.
[26:19.790 --> 26:22.750]  Use four of the same strain. Let those plants grow all into that net.
[26:22.990 --> 26:26.310]  Keep bending them down, bending them down, keeping them low. Do some,
[26:26.910 --> 26:30.510]  go and pop and twist the stems. Do a little bit of super cropping in there.
[26:30.510 --> 26:32.230]  Make sure those sticks are nice and strong.
[26:32.510 --> 26:34.470]  Let them move the nutrients around real well.
[26:34.830 --> 26:36.870]  And then when you've got that screen filled in,
[26:36.910 --> 26:39.870]  let it grow straight up just a little bit and then flip it into flower.
[26:39.950 --> 26:42.830]  And I think you will be completely happy with your results.
[26:43.550 --> 26:45.590]  Again, I know I left a whole bunch of wiggle room in there.
[26:45.590 --> 26:47.710]  I didn't give any steadfast answers,
[26:47.830 --> 26:49.630]  but this is some stuff that you get to play with.
[26:49.830 --> 26:54.470]  I did say I do the four pots, three gallons, run those Cindy 99s in there. Um,
[26:54.510 --> 26:57.990]  are these seeds feminized or are they regular? If they are F4, as it says here,
[26:57.990 --> 27:01.390]  they're probably regular seeds plan on pulling out some males.
[27:01.590 --> 27:04.350]  So here's my opinion. If this is possible for you,
[27:04.870 --> 27:08.990]  however many seeds you've got grow, all of them in that space in small pots,
[27:09.150 --> 27:13.070]  put them in a six inch net pot. And if you've got a 10 pack, run all 10 of them.
[27:13.310 --> 27:14.830]  When they get big enough to take a clone,
[27:15.030 --> 27:19.470]  take a clone from every one of them and label it. Like make plant a plant,
[27:19.470 --> 27:23.550]  a plant B plant B go label all your plants and then take a clone and label that
[27:23.550 --> 27:26.910]  clone plant, a clone, a plant B clone B, and then grow them.
[27:26.910 --> 27:29.230]  You're going to find some boys, throw the boys away,
[27:29.470 --> 27:32.990]  throw the corresponding clones away. Now you've got a bunch of girls to finish,
[27:33.230 --> 27:35.750]  finish those girls, find the one you like the best.
[27:35.750 --> 27:37.790]  You've got a clone of that over there in the cloner,
[27:38.430 --> 27:40.150]  or hopefully it's in a pot by now and rooted,
[27:40.150 --> 27:41.510]  but you've got a clone of the good one.
[27:41.750 --> 27:44.430]  So now you can grow as many of that as you want next time.
[27:44.590 --> 27:46.790]  So maybe start with a whole bunch of small pots,
[27:46.870 --> 27:50.790]  find the one you want and then run four clones of that one in three gallon pots
[27:50.810 --> 27:52.590]  next time. That may be the strategy.
[27:52.790 --> 27:55.030]  I don't know if you've got room to keep clones.
[27:55.050 --> 27:58.310]  I don't know if you have room to keep that. Uh, the good one is a mother plant.
[27:58.350 --> 27:59.550]  I don't know what your options are.
[27:59.550 --> 28:01.230]  It sounds like you've got very limited space,
[28:01.830 --> 28:05.830]  but if you can dedicate another very small space to keeping a clone and one
[28:05.850 --> 28:10.550]  keeper mother plant, you would have yourself a small perpetual grow. All right.
[28:10.550 --> 28:13.070]  You didn't say if you want me to use your name or not on the episode,
[28:13.070 --> 28:15.190]  so I'm going to be respectful and not say your name, but Hey,
[28:15.210 --> 28:17.510]  thanks for the great email. Thanks for asking questions.
[28:17.750 --> 28:20.990]  If you've got more specific questions about scrogging or if you need any help,
[28:21.010 --> 28:23.430]  please feel free to send me another email. Of course,
[28:23.430 --> 28:25.310]  it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[28:25.550 --> 28:28.430]  I would love to hear from everybody who has a grow question.
[28:28.630 --> 28:31.750]  I love helping my audience out. All right, podcast world.
[28:31.750 --> 28:34.670]  My throat is starting to tell me that it is time to wrap up the podcast.
[28:34.670 --> 28:37.270]  I'm sure you can hear it in my voice. I'm getting a little raspy.
[28:37.550 --> 28:40.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, the next episode is number 250.
[28:40.550 --> 28:42.350]  I'm super proud to have made it this far.
[28:42.610 --> 28:44.750]  I do promise you that I've got more grow lessons coming.
[28:44.750 --> 28:47.350]  I know the last couple of episodes have been weird topics,
[28:47.350 --> 28:50.430]  not mainly based on growing, but I've got more gross stuff coming for you.
[28:50.830 --> 28:53.430]  Ladies and gentlemen, please keep the emails coming. Like I said a moment ago,
[28:53.450 --> 28:56.910]  it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com. Also, let me mention something.
[28:57.030 --> 29:01.550]  I had a couple of messages in a saved folder that I really wanted to read and I
[29:01.550 --> 29:02.790]  don't know what happened,
[29:02.790 --> 29:06.710]  but I updated my iPhone and I feel like my saved messages folder disappeared.
[29:06.710 --> 29:08.150]  I don't know where some messages went.
[29:08.470 --> 29:12.070]  So if you feel like you've sent me a really good email and I didn't read it on
[29:12.090 --> 29:15.110]  the show, feel free to send it to me again. I may have lost it.
[29:15.130 --> 29:17.070]  I may have missed it. I don't know what happened.
[29:17.270 --> 29:20.030]  Feel free to bombard me with your emails about the podcast,
[29:20.150 --> 29:22.630]  because I would love to get your message on the show.
[29:22.650 --> 29:25.590]  I don't want to miss anybody. I've got a lot of emails stacked up here.
[29:25.590 --> 29:28.590]  I am working my way through the pile. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[29:28.590 --> 29:31.350]  this is the part of the podcast where I remind you about Patreon.
[29:31.350 --> 29:34.190]  If you felt like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks of your time and you'd
[29:34.190 --> 29:38.270]  like to contribute, all you need to do is go to patreon.com slash grow from your
[29:38.270 --> 29:40.750]  heart. I'm not trying to get rich off of podcasting.
[29:40.950 --> 29:43.610]  What I'm asking for help in is helping paying for my website,
[29:43.610 --> 29:47.870]  where I host the show that helps me deliver this podcast to you for free.
[29:48.390 --> 29:50.870]  If you're unable to contribute, keep listening. I still love you.

[30:40.030 --> 30:41.950]  A lot of old episodes are falling out of the feed.
[30:41.950 --> 30:43.750]  I'm doing the throwback Thursday episodes.
[30:43.990 --> 30:46.590]  I've done so many that those are now falling out of the feed.
[30:47.070 --> 30:49.470]  I've put the first 100 episodes on YouTube.
[30:49.470 --> 30:52.190]  The first 20 are on the old I Grow Culture channel.
