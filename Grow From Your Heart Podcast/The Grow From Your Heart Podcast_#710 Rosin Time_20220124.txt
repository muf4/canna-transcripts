[00:06.400 --> 00:07.960]  All right, here we go.
[00:07.960 --> 00:08.960]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08.960 --> 00:13.120]  It is time for episode 710 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:13.120 --> 00:15.320]  I do have some wonderful guests with me today.
[00:15.320 --> 00:18.520]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do some shout outs to a few of those great
[00:18.520 --> 00:21.560]  folks who support the show on Patreon.
[00:21.560 --> 00:25.440]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to our friend
[00:25.440 --> 00:26.440]  Daniel.
[00:26.440 --> 00:30.080]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to David W. Let's send a fist bump to a long time friend
[00:30.080 --> 00:31.320]  Jesse Grose.
[00:31.320 --> 00:34.120]  Let's send a big fist bump to Oric and lots of trichomes.
[00:34.120 --> 00:36.280]  Let's send a thank you shout out to the Dad Hayes.
[00:36.280 --> 00:40.480]  I want to send a big fist bump to Guido7 and Double P. Let's send a big fist bump to a
[00:40.480 --> 00:45.480]  great supporter Brian P. I want to send a thank you shout out to Froggle Rock and AllMixedUp.
[00:45.480 --> 00:48.040]  Let's send a thank you shout out to the Larf Knight Rises.
[00:48.040 --> 00:52.080]  Then wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to Elders
[00:52.080 --> 00:53.360]  Garden.
[00:53.360 --> 00:57.640]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[00:57.640 --> 01:01.080]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.920]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:06.920 --> 01:10.200]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen and you know I do include
[01:10.200 --> 01:14.600]  that link in the show notes and the video description to make it super easy for all
[01:14.600 --> 01:16.000]  of my stoned friends.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.480]  All right, I got through that intro super quickly right after a dab.
[01:19.480 --> 01:20.480]  I'm trying to catch my breath.
[01:20.480 --> 01:23.520]  I am excited to get started here on the show today.
[01:23.520 --> 01:25.920]  We do have some wonderful concentrate makers.
[01:25.920 --> 01:28.560]  Let me start off by introducing my friend Pedro.
[01:28.560 --> 01:29.560]  Welcome to the show brother.
[01:29.560 --> 01:30.560]  Yo cheers brother.
[01:31.040 --> 01:32.040]  How are you?
[01:32.040 --> 01:33.040]  Thank you very very much for considering me on the show.
[01:33.040 --> 01:34.040]  I'm blown away.
[01:34.040 --> 01:35.040]  Thank you.
[01:35.040 --> 01:36.040]  Oh man, it's great to have you.
[01:36.040 --> 01:41.120]  I posted to Discord that I wanted to have concentrate makers on the show and Pedro and
[01:41.120 --> 01:43.920]  Ryan just were the top two recommendations.
[01:43.920 --> 01:46.640]  Everybody was like get Pedro, get Ryan, get Pedro, get Ryan.
[01:46.640 --> 01:48.840]  It was more than obvious that this was the show that had to happen.
[01:48.840 --> 01:49.840]  So it's great to have you brother.
[01:49.840 --> 01:50.840]  Thank you for being here.
[01:50.840 --> 01:51.840]  Again, thank you.
[01:51.840 --> 01:52.840]  Before we get too far.
[01:52.840 --> 01:54.480]  Oh yeah brother for sure.
[01:54.480 --> 01:58.080]  Before we go too far Pedro, would you like to do some plugs and let everybody know how
[01:58.080 --> 02:02.120]  they can stalk you because I do know you have a lot of avenues for people to find you.
[02:02.120 --> 02:03.640]  Yeah, I sure do.
[02:03.640 --> 02:10.320]  I guess first and foremost the main Instagram account is Mr. Rosins dot or Mr. dot Rosins
[02:10.320 --> 02:11.320]  dot neighborhood.
[02:11.320 --> 02:12.720]  Kind of a play there.
[02:12.720 --> 02:14.600]  But Mr. Rosins neighborhood.
[02:14.600 --> 02:22.120]  All of the passion Rosin pressing that I do takes place over on Rosin dot is dot legal
[02:22.120 --> 02:24.240]  dot fuckers.
[02:24.240 --> 02:25.840]  So Rosin is legal fuckers.
[02:26.320 --> 02:29.320]  That was a little kick for Instagram when they shot my first account down.
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.400]  I have my glass sales and everything is over on the heady vault.
[02:34.400 --> 02:36.520]  So there's a bunch of glass sales over there.
[02:36.520 --> 02:41.480]  We've got Pedro's grow room dot com dot dot Pedro's grow room dot com for glass sales
[02:41.480 --> 02:46.400]  for discounts for education for information to contact me.
[02:46.400 --> 02:47.600]  And there's a discord as well.
[02:47.600 --> 02:49.920]  But just contact me through those avenues and we'll get you hooked up.
[02:49.920 --> 02:52.520]  I think that's probably about the best ways.
[02:52.760 --> 02:55.640]  Hopefully that Instagram is still up by the time this episode airs.
[02:55.640 --> 02:57.720]  They're getting people rather than jinx you.
[02:57.720 --> 02:59.920]  I know there's wood around here somewhere.
[02:59.920 --> 03:00.920]  Yeah.
[03:00.920 --> 03:01.920]  Well, I knocked on some good wood, bro.
[03:01.920 --> 03:02.920]  Thank you for the great.
[03:02.920 --> 03:03.920]  That's a lot of stuff to plug.
[03:03.920 --> 03:04.920]  Also, find him on Twitch.
[03:04.920 --> 03:05.920]  I think you do some.
[03:05.920 --> 03:06.920]  I do.
[03:06.920 --> 03:09.240]  I am on Twitter to twitch dot TV for Pedro's girl.
[03:09.240 --> 03:10.240]  Thanks, man.
[03:10.240 --> 03:13.200]  Every Wednesday night, man, we're on a streak with two hundred and forty some weeks in every
[03:13.200 --> 03:14.200]  Tuesday night.
[03:14.200 --> 03:17.160]  Just kind of a little stoner session about nine thirty on Tuesday night.
[03:17.160 --> 03:19.000]  So if you're down, come get high with us.
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.000]  Yeah.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.000]  Check him out.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.780]  He concentrates through beautiful glass.
[03:22.780 --> 03:24.120]  So make sure you check that out.
[03:24.120 --> 03:25.120]  Follow him on Twitch.
[03:25.120 --> 03:26.120]  Thank you, bro.
[03:26.120 --> 03:27.120]  All right.
[03:27.120 --> 03:29.960]  Let's move on and introduce the legend, Mr. Rosen.
[03:29.960 --> 03:31.640]  Ryan, thank you for being here, bro.
[03:31.640 --> 03:32.640]  Well, thank you.
[03:32.640 --> 03:34.360]  I'm glad to be here, man.
[03:34.360 --> 03:37.160]  I don't really, I guess, have as many plugs as Pedro.
[03:37.160 --> 03:38.160]  That's for sure.
[03:38.160 --> 03:42.080]  I guess you can pretty much for the most part catch me on our army discord, man.
[03:42.080 --> 03:43.520]  I hang out there quite a bit.
[03:43.520 --> 03:47.560]  I've got a hell of a crew, a community over there that we're building.
[03:47.560 --> 03:50.520]  I'm glad that everybody kind of pushed me to be here.
[03:50.520 --> 03:51.520]  And that's about it.
[03:51.520 --> 03:52.520]  Well, thank you, bro.
[03:52.520 --> 03:53.520]  I'm glad they pushed you.
[03:53.520 --> 03:54.520]  I hope it didn't take too much.
[03:54.520 --> 03:55.520]  Not at all.
[03:55.520 --> 03:56.520]  Not at all.
[03:56.520 --> 03:57.520]  Glad to be here.
[03:57.520 --> 03:58.520]  For sure, brother.
[03:58.520 --> 03:59.520]  This is the 710 episode.
[03:59.520 --> 04:04.240]  Before I go too far into it, let's briefly talk about what 710 is and means so that people
[04:04.240 --> 04:06.840]  understand why we're doing a hash episode on 710.
[04:06.840 --> 04:09.960]  Then we'll delve deeply into making concentrates.
[04:09.960 --> 04:14.040]  What I want to focus on in this episode is I want to get the audience, the listeners
[04:14.040 --> 04:15.440]  basically self-sufficient.
[04:15.440 --> 04:19.960]  I want them to be able to grow from seed or clone, however they're growing, manage their
[04:19.960 --> 04:25.120]  grow all the way up to getting that dab onto the nail and taking a fat hit of their product.
[04:25.120 --> 04:26.120]  Pedro got excited.
[04:26.120 --> 04:27.400]  He's about to take that fat rip right now.
[04:27.400 --> 04:28.400]  Cheers, brother.
[04:28.400 --> 04:29.400]  Enjoy that.
[04:29.400 --> 04:32.280]  So let's briefly talk about what 710 is.
[04:32.280 --> 04:38.320]  A lot of people might not even know why we are celebrating 710, the 710th episode.
[04:38.320 --> 04:40.200]  So let's give them a quick update.
[04:40.200 --> 04:44.560]  Since Pedro has taken a dab, Ryan, do you have any input on what 710 means?
[04:44.680 --> 04:47.480]  I'll let you talk for a minute because I feel like I talk a lot on the show.
[04:47.480 --> 04:50.520]  Well, 710 to me is kind of a newer thing.
[04:50.520 --> 04:52.880]  I mean, it's oil backwards.
[04:52.880 --> 04:54.560]  It's for us dabbers these days.
[04:54.560 --> 04:55.560]  That's the new 420.
[04:55.560 --> 04:57.520]  That's exactly what I would have said.
[04:57.520 --> 04:58.880]  It is the new 420.
[04:58.880 --> 04:59.880]  It's upgraded 420.
[04:59.880 --> 05:01.880]  420 for big kids.
[05:01.880 --> 05:03.280]  Absolutely.
[05:03.280 --> 05:04.280]  Upgrade your tolerance.
[05:04.280 --> 05:05.280]  All right.
[05:05.280 --> 05:07.080]  So basically that is what I would have said.
[05:07.080 --> 05:08.080]  It is the new 420.
[05:08.080 --> 05:09.080]  I agree.
[05:09.080 --> 05:10.080]  I concur.
[05:10.080 --> 05:11.080]  I concur.
[05:11.080 --> 05:12.080]  All right.
[05:12.080 --> 05:13.080]  We're all agreeing.
[05:13.080 --> 05:14.080]  It is the new 420.
[05:14.600 --> 05:15.600]  It's 710.
[05:15.600 --> 05:16.600]  710.
[05:16.600 --> 05:18.960]  So when that clock strikes 710, we used to smoke a bowl at 420.
[05:18.960 --> 05:23.520]  I still smoke a bowl at 420, but now also I'm taking a dab at 710.
[05:23.520 --> 05:24.520]  So today-
[05:24.520 --> 05:25.520]  There's just another excuse.
[05:25.520 --> 05:26.520]  That's like we need an excuse, right?
[05:26.520 --> 05:27.520]  Because I think I might dab.
[05:27.520 --> 05:30.520]  I was just going to say, we actually did take one on 710.
[05:30.520 --> 05:31.520]  Yes.
[05:31.520 --> 05:32.520]  As we're recording.
[05:32.520 --> 05:33.520]  Oh, we actually were.
[05:33.520 --> 05:34.520]  We didn't even notice.
[05:34.520 --> 05:35.520]  We did.
[05:35.520 --> 05:36.520]  Beautiful.
[05:36.520 --> 05:37.520]  Seeing the life of yourself out that way.
[05:37.520 --> 05:39.480]  So 710 is dab time.
[05:39.480 --> 05:41.240]  So this is the 710th episode.
[05:41.400 --> 05:44.600]  I want to teach everybody how to make their own dabs at home.
[05:44.600 --> 05:47.200]  We're not going to talk about BHO.
[05:47.200 --> 05:52.040]  No solvent-less stuff here because I don't want to encourage anybody or teach them how
[05:52.040 --> 05:53.040]  to hurt themselves.
[05:53.040 --> 05:55.200]  There's a lot of shit that can go wrong in that.
[05:55.200 --> 05:56.840]  No offense, no hatred if you're doing that.
[05:56.840 --> 06:01.360]  Do your thing, but stay safe and don't call me when you get blown up by your own mistakes.
[06:01.360 --> 06:02.360]  So we're going to dodge that.
[06:02.360 --> 06:04.280]  I'd like to step in there if I could for a second.
[06:04.280 --> 06:05.280]  I want to hear it, brother.
[06:05.280 --> 06:06.280]  That's what you're here for.
[06:06.280 --> 06:07.280]  Good.
[06:07.280 --> 06:11.220]  Because you said something that I hear a lot of people say, and it's like sticking something
[06:11.220 --> 06:12.220]  underneath my skin.
[06:12.220 --> 06:13.380]  It just drives me nuts.
[06:13.380 --> 06:16.140]  It's like a little mosquito buzzing around your head.
[06:16.140 --> 06:17.140]  I want to show you how to make dabs.
[06:17.140 --> 06:19.480]  I want to show you how to make dabs.
[06:19.480 --> 06:20.480]  It's not dabs.
[06:20.480 --> 06:21.480]  Dabs are...
[06:21.480 --> 06:22.480]  A dab is like a...
[06:22.480 --> 06:25.880]  It's a verb, right?
[06:25.880 --> 06:27.400]  So it's not a noun.
[06:27.400 --> 06:29.760]  We're going to show you how to make hash and how to make rosin.
[06:29.760 --> 06:31.160]  That's what we're going to talk about today.
[06:31.160 --> 06:32.160]  Perfect.
[06:32.160 --> 06:33.160]  Thank you.
[06:33.160 --> 06:34.160]  I appreciate that.
[06:34.160 --> 06:35.160]  And live rosin, hopefully.
[06:35.160 --> 06:36.160]  Yeah.
[06:36.160 --> 06:37.160]  And we'll talk about the differences.
[06:37.160 --> 06:38.160]  Yeah, we'll talk about differences.
[06:38.160 --> 06:40.140]  Well, let's jump into it now that we're here.
[06:40.140 --> 06:43.260]  This is a good part to just jump off on.
[06:43.260 --> 06:44.540]  Let's talk about the process.
[06:44.540 --> 06:47.500]  I want to start with kind of like...
[06:47.500 --> 06:50.620]  I'm hoping that a lot of the people watching are growing their own product as well.
[06:50.620 --> 06:54.140]  They've got to get the product to wash, to press from somewhere.
[06:54.140 --> 06:58.280]  So let's talk about, are there any significant differences in the grow?
[06:58.280 --> 07:00.000]  If we were going to grow for flower...
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.100]  When I grow, I grow for seed.
[07:01.100 --> 07:03.160]  So my grow is way different than most people.
[07:03.160 --> 07:04.780]  Most people are growing for flower.
[07:04.780 --> 07:06.040]  You guys are growing for concentrate.
[07:06.040 --> 07:11.360]  Is there a big difference in the way you treat the grow other than most people?
[07:11.360 --> 07:12.360]  I would say minimally.
[07:12.360 --> 07:13.360]  I would say the biggest thing is strain selection.
[07:13.360 --> 07:14.360]  Yeah, I would agree.
[07:14.360 --> 07:18.800]  I would say minimally as far as technique.
[07:18.800 --> 07:23.040]  The only thing I can come up with would be scrogging excessively so that you don't get
[07:23.040 --> 07:24.280]  main big colas.
[07:24.280 --> 07:27.840]  You want a very consistent bud size.
[07:27.840 --> 07:33.080]  So a big scrog is something that I really, really strive for.
[07:33.080 --> 07:35.540]  My plants grow horizontally, not vertically.
[07:35.540 --> 07:38.660]  And that's what most people should be doing now anyway, no matter how you're growing.
[07:38.660 --> 07:40.420]  That's kind of the ideal way to do it.
[07:40.420 --> 07:43.860]  It's a good way to maximize your space, really, especially for us home growers.
[07:43.860 --> 07:44.860]  I'm a scrogger.
[07:44.860 --> 07:46.860]  I'm a four by four scroggs.
[07:46.860 --> 07:47.860]  Perfect.
[07:47.860 --> 07:48.860]  Let's step back for a second.
[07:48.860 --> 07:56.260]  Can we explain just as an overview what Hash and Rousin are and what we're trying to achieve
[07:56.260 --> 07:58.220]  and why we're doing what we're doing?
[07:58.220 --> 07:59.220]  Absolutely.
[07:59.220 --> 08:00.220]  Let's do it.
[08:00.220 --> 08:01.220]  Okay.
[08:01.220 --> 08:05.380]  So I like to explain it in a broad sense, kind of like Hash for dummies, right?
[08:06.220 --> 08:12.860]  Trichomes are the plants, a defense mechanism for UV light and for bugs and pests and whatnot.
[08:12.860 --> 08:17.100]  You have to think of them as, I think of them as millions and billions and billions of little
[08:17.100 --> 08:20.020]  beach balls on your plants, right?
[08:20.020 --> 08:22.820]  And those beach balls are on top of a stalk.
[08:22.820 --> 08:27.160]  And we don't need to get into technical terms because that's just advanced classes.
[08:27.160 --> 08:30.900]  So you've got billions of beach balls on top of a stalk.
[08:30.900 --> 08:34.660]  What we are after from a Hash standpoint is those beach balls.
[08:34.660 --> 08:39.380]  All of those little beach balls, they're a little waxy cuticle filled with oil, hopefully
[08:39.380 --> 08:41.520]  filled with oil, right?
[08:41.520 --> 08:46.660]  And that oil inside that waxy cuticle is what us Rousin heads are after.
[08:46.660 --> 08:51.780]  We leave the waxy cuticle behind in the Hash and we extract the oil, which is where the
[08:51.780 --> 08:53.960]  710, the oil comes from.
[08:53.960 --> 08:59.620]  So there is spots you can stop along the way, but that is kind of ultimately what we are
[08:59.620 --> 09:00.740]  going after.
[09:00.740 --> 09:05.140]  And everything that we're going to be talking about subsequently eases our access to those
[09:05.140 --> 09:06.140]  trichome heads.
[09:06.140 --> 09:07.140]  Okay.
[09:07.140 --> 09:08.140]  That was a perfect explanation.
[09:08.140 --> 09:09.140]  Yeah.
[09:09.140 --> 09:10.140]  Thank you.
[09:10.140 --> 09:11.140]  Yeah.
[09:11.140 --> 09:12.140]  I don't even need notes after you go.
[09:12.140 --> 09:13.140]  That was perfect.
[09:13.140 --> 09:14.140]  I don't even have anything to say after that.
[09:14.140 --> 09:15.140]  Yeah.
[09:15.140 --> 09:16.140]  Cool.
[09:16.140 --> 09:17.140]  Yeah.
[09:17.140 --> 09:18.140]  Case dismissed.
[09:18.140 --> 09:19.140]  So you said trichome heads.
[09:19.140 --> 09:20.140]  I'm going to jump back to a conversation that I interrupted before the show.
[09:20.140 --> 09:21.140]  Do trichome head sizes make a big difference in trichome shape?
[09:21.140 --> 09:22.140]  I would say yes.
[09:22.140 --> 09:23.140]  I would say yes.
[09:23.140 --> 09:24.140]  I would say yes.
[09:24.140 --> 09:25.140]  I would say yes.
[09:25.140 --> 09:26.140]  I would say yes.
[09:26.140 --> 09:27.140]  I would say yes.
[09:27.140 --> 09:28.140]  I would say yes.
[09:28.140 --> 09:29.140]  I would say yes.
[09:29.140 --> 09:30.140]  I would say yes.
[09:30.540 --> 09:31.540]  I would say yes.
[09:31.540 --> 09:32.540]  Absolutely.
[09:32.540 --> 09:33.900]  We're after those big trichome heads.
[09:33.900 --> 09:36.980]  And we want that weak neck that we can kind of break off and get those beach balls as
[09:36.980 --> 09:37.980]  Patrick just explained.
[09:37.980 --> 09:38.980]  Yep.
[09:38.980 --> 09:39.980]  Yep.
[09:39.980 --> 09:44.140]  And the size, size not so much about the shape.
[09:44.140 --> 09:48.180]  You know, if you've got heads that are stuck together, two, three, four heads, I mean,
[09:48.180 --> 09:51.180]  you can have a stock with two, three, four heads stuck together.
[09:51.180 --> 09:53.100]  They're going to collect in different bags and whatnot.
[09:53.100 --> 09:57.260]  So uniformity is also desirable as well in size.
[09:57.260 --> 10:03.000]  That being noted, as I said a couple of seconds ago, the trichomes are the plant's protection
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.860]  against UV light, right?
[10:04.860 --> 10:11.260]  So if you're not giving them UV light, they have nothing to create a protection against.
[10:11.260 --> 10:17.420]  A lot of sun-grown cannabis has big, juicy, bulbous trichome heads because of the extra
[10:17.420 --> 10:20.460]  UV light from the sun.
[10:20.460 --> 10:21.460]  I did not know that.
[10:21.460 --> 10:23.340]  So you're teaching me stuff right now.
[10:23.340 --> 10:24.340]  Ryan, I feel like you're-
[10:24.420 --> 10:28.420]  I keep that in mind when you're making your LED selections as well for your lighting.
[10:28.420 --> 10:29.420]  Absolutely.
[10:29.420 --> 10:30.420]  Beautiful.
[10:30.420 --> 10:31.420]  All right.
[10:31.420 --> 10:34.140]  So you guys, if you're going to make concentrates, let's upgrade and get some of those LEDs with
[10:34.140 --> 10:35.140]  UV lights in there.
[10:35.140 --> 10:36.260]  That may help you out.
[10:36.260 --> 10:38.540]  Bigger trichomes, the better.
[10:38.540 --> 10:41.340]  So the strain selection, that was one of the things that you mentioned, that it's all about,
[10:41.340 --> 10:43.300]  a lot about strain selection.
[10:43.300 --> 10:45.140]  Do you find a difference?
[10:45.140 --> 10:48.740]  Back in the day, Dr. Dre taught us that we want a sack of rocks.
[10:48.740 --> 10:49.860]  Everybody wants dense buds.
[10:49.860 --> 10:52.660]  If you go to the dispensary, all the buds are super dense.
[10:52.980 --> 10:54.740]  I think you know where I'm going.
[10:54.740 --> 10:58.620]  Does the bud density really make a difference for you concentrate makers?
[10:58.620 --> 11:01.020]  Are those fluffier buds going to be more ideal for you?
[11:01.020 --> 11:02.020]  Yeah.
[11:02.020 --> 11:03.020]  Yeah.
[11:03.020 --> 11:04.020]  It makes a huge difference.
[11:04.020 --> 11:05.580]  A lot easier to wash, that's for sure.
[11:05.580 --> 11:09.420]  I was actually just talking to somebody, I was reading through Discord and somebody was
[11:09.420 --> 11:11.460]  giving someone a suggestion upon lights and this and that.
[11:11.460 --> 11:14.300]  And they said, if you don't give them enough light, you're going to have airy buds.
[11:14.300 --> 11:16.420]  And they were like, oh, that's a bummer.
[11:16.420 --> 11:17.420]  I don't want airy buds.
[11:17.420 --> 11:18.420]  And I'm like, I do.
[11:18.420 --> 11:23.780]  I'd much rather have a bud that the first wash just falls apart rather than go in on
[11:23.780 --> 11:28.420]  the third wash and see dense nuggets that I still haven't broken into.
[11:28.420 --> 11:33.020]  I've always explained it as if I took my fist and moistened my fist and dunked it in powdered
[11:33.020 --> 11:36.620]  sugar, I get my fist worth of trichomes on the outside here.
[11:36.620 --> 11:41.380]  If I open up my hand and do the same process, I get my palm, all the insides of my fingers,
[11:41.380 --> 11:43.340]  I get that much more space for trichomes.
[11:43.340 --> 11:45.140]  And also, like you said, easier to wash.
[11:45.140 --> 11:46.820]  I don't have to wash inside of my fist.
[11:46.820 --> 11:47.820]  I got fingers open.
[11:48.220 --> 11:49.220]  I can wash that.
[11:49.220 --> 11:51.500]  I really, I thought that would be a thing of the future.
[11:51.500 --> 11:55.060]  Some of what I breed isn't super tight and super dense, but I know that it, uh, you press
[11:55.060 --> 11:59.820]  some strawberry starburst and, uh, Pedro and that was some of the best rosin I've ever
[11:59.820 --> 12:00.820]  smoked.
[12:00.820 --> 12:01.820]  That changed my mind on rosin, honestly.
[12:01.820 --> 12:02.820]  Oh, nice.
[12:02.820 --> 12:03.820]  Good.
[12:03.820 --> 12:04.820]  Yes, sir.
[12:04.820 --> 12:05.820]  A big shout out to our friend Kelvin who grew that.
[12:05.820 --> 12:07.820]  And then you pressed that at the dude grows cup.
[12:07.820 --> 12:10.820]  Man, that was a hell of a freaking thing.
[12:10.820 --> 12:11.820]  Wasn't that a good time?
[12:11.820 --> 12:12.820]  I missed those events.
[12:12.820 --> 12:13.820]  That put a smile on my face.
[12:13.820 --> 12:14.820]  All these times come back.
[12:14.820 --> 12:15.820]  Right?
[12:16.820 --> 12:17.820]  Hopefully all these times come back soon.
[12:17.820 --> 12:18.820]  Yeah.
[12:18.820 --> 12:19.820]  Oh yeah.
[12:19.820 --> 12:20.820]  It's coming back around.
[12:20.820 --> 12:25.820]  Now we're talking about making concentrates out of trichomes from plants that we're growing.
[12:25.820 --> 12:28.820]  One of my main questions was, do we treat them any differently?
[12:28.820 --> 12:29.820]  It seems like we just grow them like normal.
[12:29.820 --> 12:31.820]  Try not to scrug them, take good care of them.
[12:31.820 --> 12:32.820]  How do we manage pests?
[12:32.820 --> 12:35.820]  A lot of people are putting pesticides on plants.
[12:35.820 --> 12:40.820]  I don't want to smoke pesticides, especially pesticide concentrates in my concentrate.
[12:40.820 --> 12:42.820]  How do you guys manage pests in your garden?
[12:42.820 --> 12:44.820]  Wait, who's spraying pesticides?
[12:44.820 --> 12:45.820]  That's what I'm asking.
[12:45.820 --> 12:48.820]  Wait a second.
[12:48.820 --> 12:49.820]  What are you guys doing?
[12:49.820 --> 12:51.820]  Nothing gets sprayed in my flower room, period.
[12:51.820 --> 12:54.820]  Nothing, no foliar, no nothing in my flower room.
[12:54.820 --> 12:56.820]  And that's just the way it is.
[12:56.820 --> 12:58.820]  I'm just sacrilegious about it.
[12:58.820 --> 12:59.820]  It doesn't happen.
[12:59.820 --> 13:02.820]  If I have pests in my flower room, we cut, we start over.
[13:02.820 --> 13:03.820]  Wow, that's dedication.
[13:03.820 --> 13:04.820]  I'm pretty much the same way.
[13:04.820 --> 13:08.820]  So same way, no sprays or anything like that in my flower room.
[13:08.820 --> 13:11.820]  If I do have any issues for me, it's generally thrips up here.
[13:11.820 --> 13:12.820]  We get thrips quite a bit.
[13:12.820 --> 13:15.820]  I usually do green lacewing larvae.
[13:15.820 --> 13:16.820]  They work really good.
[13:16.820 --> 13:18.820]  Simple, cheap.
[13:18.820 --> 13:21.820]  One round usually takes care of pretty much right through flower.
[13:21.820 --> 13:22.820]  And that does it, man.
[13:22.820 --> 13:25.820]  Other than I'm a big Dr. Zimes person pretty much through veg.
[13:25.820 --> 13:28.820]  Dr. Zimes and green cleaner.
[13:28.820 --> 13:29.820]  Enzymatics.
[13:29.820 --> 13:31.820]  I will agree with the beneficial bugs greatly.
[13:31.820 --> 13:35.820]  I generally try to stick with them in veg, but of course they carry over into flower.
[13:35.820 --> 13:37.820]  So yeah, I agree with that.
[13:37.820 --> 13:38.820]  I concur big time.
[13:38.820 --> 13:41.820]  I was hoping that that would be the answer was the beneficial predators there.
[13:41.820 --> 13:42.820]  And I'm glad you said lacewings.
[13:42.820 --> 13:46.820]  Those have been some of my favorite in a commercial grow, especially in Colorado,
[13:46.820 --> 13:48.820]  because they tolerate all types of environments.
[13:48.820 --> 13:52.820]  They don't die off as quickly as your swarskies and hypoaspis.
[13:52.820 --> 13:54.820]  And they stick around a little bit.
[13:54.820 --> 13:56.820]  And those larvae are hungry.
[13:56.820 --> 13:58.820]  Yeah, those little crocodiles.
[13:58.820 --> 13:59.820]  They go crazy.
[13:59.820 --> 14:01.820]  They're cool as hell looking.
[14:01.820 --> 14:03.820]  They're like dinosaur crocodiles.
[14:03.820 --> 14:04.820]  You ever been bitten by one?
[14:04.820 --> 14:05.820]  They'll bite you.
[14:05.820 --> 14:06.820]  Oh, really?
[14:06.820 --> 14:07.820]  They'll bite the shit out of you.
[14:07.820 --> 14:09.820]  I'm pretty sure that's what was biting us.
[14:09.820 --> 14:10.820]  They'll bite the shit out of you.
[14:10.820 --> 14:11.820]  All right.
[14:11.820 --> 14:13.820]  So we've talked a lot about the grow process.
[14:13.820 --> 14:14.820]  Grow it.
[14:14.820 --> 14:15.820]  Don't spray it.
[14:15.820 --> 14:17.820]  Try to get the even-sized buds.
[14:17.820 --> 14:18.820]  We want bigger trichomes.
[14:18.820 --> 14:20.820]  That seems to be a thing.
[14:20.820 --> 14:24.820]  Let's get into the process of actually making the concentrates here.
[14:24.820 --> 14:30.820]  I don't know the first thing about making any sort of rosin, any live rosin.
[14:30.820 --> 14:33.820]  So let's say we are right to the day of harvest.
[14:33.820 --> 14:35.820]  What do we do if we're going to make concentrates?
[14:35.820 --> 14:37.820]  I know a lot of us are going to freeze it.
[14:37.820 --> 14:39.820]  Some of us are going to press it right away.
[14:39.820 --> 14:41.820]  What are the differences that we're going to run into?
[14:41.820 --> 14:44.820]  Can you teach me how to harvest for concentrate production?
[14:44.820 --> 14:45.820]  Yeah.
[14:45.820 --> 14:47.820]  The first thing that comes to mind is cold.
[14:47.820 --> 14:49.820]  Cold, cold, cold.
[14:49.820 --> 14:50.820]  All right.
[14:50.820 --> 14:52.820]  And then it comes down to, yeah, are we doing fresh?
[14:52.820 --> 14:53.820]  Are we doing a half dry?
[14:53.820 --> 14:54.820]  Are we doing a full dry?
[14:54.820 --> 14:58.820]  As far as I'm concerned, that's kind of the three things that we can do.
[14:58.820 --> 15:02.820]  And I'll let Rosin take the fresh because he says he likes fresh, so go live, bro.
[15:02.820 --> 15:04.820]  I really like the fresh stuff.
[15:04.820 --> 15:08.820]  Pretty much, you know, most of my top buds and stuff, for the most part,
[15:08.820 --> 15:10.820]  I pretty much generally keep for smoking.
[15:10.820 --> 15:12.820]  I generally do it all for myself.
[15:12.820 --> 15:17.820]  So all my larv, anything that doesn't have any kind of bag appeal, pretty much goes right to my hash bags.
[15:17.820 --> 15:23.820]  I fresh freeze it that night and then I pretty much try to process it as soon as I possibly can.
[15:23.820 --> 15:27.820]  If I tend to store it, I do vacuum seal it and keep it frozen that way.
[15:27.820 --> 15:29.820]  The longer the storage, obviously the worse.
[15:29.820 --> 15:33.820]  So terpene preservation is everything, obviously.
[15:33.820 --> 15:37.820]  So other than that, like Pedro said, cold, cold, cold.
[15:37.820 --> 15:39.820]  I'm a strong believer in distilled water.
[15:39.820 --> 15:41.820]  I like my water super, super cold.
[15:41.820 --> 15:44.820]  I don't like to wash unless it's wintertime generally.
[15:44.820 --> 15:47.820]  You know, garage is a perfect place for that this time of year.
[15:47.820 --> 15:49.820]  I've got the words washing weather on my notes here.
[15:49.820 --> 15:50.820]  I was going to talk about that.
[15:50.820 --> 15:52.820]  It is beautiful washing weather.
[15:52.820 --> 15:53.820]  It is.
[15:53.820 --> 15:55.820]  I don't touch anything all summer long.
[15:55.820 --> 15:57.820]  Really? You don't even mess with it in the summer?
[15:57.820 --> 15:59.820]  I don't personally, no.
[15:59.820 --> 16:03.820]  What's like the temperature threshold when you start going, oh, it's washing season?
[16:03.820 --> 16:04.820]  What gets you excited?
[16:04.820 --> 16:06.820]  As soon as I see that snowfly.
[16:06.820 --> 16:07.820]  That's all I can think about.
[16:07.820 --> 16:09.820]  Pedro's got a big silly grin.
[16:09.820 --> 16:11.820]  Yeah, I was just letting him go.
[16:11.820 --> 16:13.820]  I'm just thinking about where I can fill in here and where.
[16:13.820 --> 16:17.820]  Snowboard kids and the hash washers get excited at that first snow.
[16:17.820 --> 16:19.820]  I have a cold room.
[16:19.820 --> 16:21.820]  I built myself a cold room.
[16:21.820 --> 16:26.820]  So I can make it 32 degrees in my room when it's 100 degrees outside.
[16:26.820 --> 16:34.820]  And I always wash in 33-degree weather if I can, especially with fresh frozen.
[16:34.820 --> 16:36.820]  My God, especially with fresh frozen.
[16:36.820 --> 16:41.820]  That's one of the nuances that doesn't get talked about enough.
[16:41.820 --> 16:44.820]  Is people, you know, fresh frozen, fresh frozen.
[16:44.820 --> 16:46.820]  Have you ever touched a fucking plant?
[16:46.820 --> 16:49.820]  You ever seen how sticky a plant is?
[16:49.820 --> 16:51.820]  Now collect all those sticky balls.
[16:51.820 --> 16:52.820]  Right?
[16:52.820 --> 16:53.820]  So that's why we do it in the cold.
[16:53.820 --> 16:56.820]  The cold takes away a lot of the immediate stick.
[16:56.820 --> 16:57.820]  Right?
[16:57.820 --> 16:59.820]  And it also brittles the trichome heads.
[16:59.820 --> 17:04.820]  And if you're doing fresh frozen, that's immensely more important to get it cold
[17:04.820 --> 17:07.820]  and to have them break off and to remain cold.
[17:07.820 --> 17:13.820]  If you have fresh frozen hash that gets above, goodness, sometimes 50 degrees,
[17:13.820 --> 17:14.820]  it's already starting to congeal.
[17:14.820 --> 17:16.820]  It's already starting to melt together.
[17:16.820 --> 17:19.820]  It's already starting to lose its beach sand consistency.
[17:19.820 --> 17:22.820]  So fresh frozen is not a beginner game.
[17:22.820 --> 17:26.820]  Fresh frozen is an advanced player game.
[17:26.820 --> 17:30.820]  Cold, cold, cold is immensely important.
[17:30.820 --> 17:36.820]  Anything, again, anything above 40 degrees and you're starting to get problematic with your bag,
[17:36.820 --> 17:38.820]  your collection bag, stuff sticking to them.
[17:38.820 --> 17:43.820]  Trichome sticking to spoons, just being a nightmare.
[17:43.820 --> 17:44.820]  Absolutely.
[17:44.820 --> 17:45.820]  Kind of one of the reasons.
[17:45.820 --> 17:50.820]  Do you even keep, I was just going to say, I even like to keep a bucket of cold water right next to me as I'm washing
[17:50.820 --> 17:52.820]  so I can put my bags right in it.
[17:52.820 --> 17:55.820]  Yeah, my bag's going in, my spoon goes into a little cup.
[17:55.820 --> 17:57.820]  A little cup with ice water in it.
[17:57.820 --> 17:58.820]  Absolutely.
[17:58.820 --> 18:02.820]  Yeah, like when I say cold, I hope I'm not being underestimated.
[18:02.820 --> 18:03.820]  You said 30 degrees.
[18:03.820 --> 18:07.820]  If you're from the coast, one of the coast, 30 degrees doesn't make sense to you.
[18:07.820 --> 18:09.820]  But go in the walk-in cooler or wherever.
[18:09.820 --> 18:11.820]  If you work at a restaurant, go in there.
[18:11.820 --> 18:12.820]  That's not 30 degrees.
[18:12.820 --> 18:15.820]  It's colder than that at 30 degrees.
[18:15.820 --> 18:16.820]  Walk-in's probably not 30.
[18:16.820 --> 18:18.820]  Yeah, walk in a walk-in cooler.
[18:18.820 --> 18:19.820]  Even your starting water.
[18:19.820 --> 18:22.820]  Stand in your walk-in cooler for eight hours and tell me how you feel.
[18:22.820 --> 18:24.820]  I was going to ask if you can get dizzy in there.
[18:24.820 --> 18:25.820]  Not physically get dizzy.
[18:25.820 --> 18:26.820]  Your wife's name is Dizzy.
[18:26.820 --> 18:29.820]  Can you get dizzy to even walk in that walk-in cooler?
[18:29.820 --> 18:31.820]  Yeah, she'll walk in and bring me lunch or something.
[18:31.820 --> 18:32.820]  That's about it.
[18:32.820 --> 18:33.820]  She's gone.
[18:33.820 --> 18:34.820]  She's out.
[18:34.820 --> 18:35.820]  She's out, yeah.
[18:35.820 --> 18:38.820]  I can't keep my dab rigs in there.
[18:38.820 --> 18:39.820]  It's too cold.
[18:39.820 --> 18:40.820]  Shatter.
[18:40.820 --> 18:41.820]  Yeah, I can't dab in there.
[18:41.820 --> 18:42.820]  I can't do much of anything.
[18:42.820 --> 18:43.820]  Water would get frozen.
[18:43.820 --> 18:45.820]  That's what I was going to mention too.
[18:45.820 --> 18:47.820]  Do you keep your water ice cold too?
[18:47.820 --> 18:51.820]  Do you keep, like I use distilled water and I always keep it in a beer fridge before I generally use it.
[18:51.820 --> 18:52.820]  Keep it right at that 33 degree mark.
[18:52.820 --> 18:59.820]  I have three 44 gallon drums as my reses in my room underneath my cabinets and those get ice.
[18:59.820 --> 19:07.820]  I mean, when I wash, I'll bet I'll go through a couple hundred pounds of ice.
[19:07.820 --> 19:08.820]  Yep.
[19:08.820 --> 19:09.820]  Wow.
[19:09.820 --> 19:10.820]  It's a lot.
[19:10.820 --> 19:11.820]  Even though my room is that cold.
[19:11.820 --> 19:12.820]  Even though my room is that cold.
[19:12.820 --> 19:13.820]  Oh, sure.
[19:13.820 --> 19:15.820]  Everything is ice cold, period.
[19:15.820 --> 19:18.820]  You're using at least 25 pounds usually per five gallon wash.
[19:18.820 --> 19:19.820]  Yeah, yeah.
[19:19.820 --> 19:20.820]  Oh, yeah.
[19:20.820 --> 19:22.820]  And then four gallons of distilled cold, cold water.
[19:22.820 --> 19:24.820]  Yeah, I don't use distilled for the wash.
[19:24.820 --> 19:25.820]  I'm over that.
[19:25.820 --> 19:29.820]  I will use RO for my final rinse.
[19:29.820 --> 19:36.820]  I will say that the higher quality water that you're going to use in minimal increments are going to be higher quality concentrates for sure.
[19:36.820 --> 19:37.820]  Absolutely.
[19:37.820 --> 19:40.820]  For us, we use well water, so you don't want that trace.
[19:40.820 --> 19:41.820]  Yeah, definitely.
[19:41.820 --> 19:43.820]  That taste to kind of transfer through.
[19:43.820 --> 19:44.820]  Agreed, agreed.
[19:44.820 --> 19:45.820]  Mineral flavor.
[19:45.820 --> 19:54.820]  Let's go back real quick though to the fresh and then half and then the other dry because I think I covered it real good with the fresh, but there's other options.
[19:54.820 --> 19:59.820]  You know, if you can't achieve 32 degrees, you know, you got outside, it's got 40 is the best I can do, bro.
[19:59.820 --> 20:03.820]  Or there's a bunch of different things.
[20:03.820 --> 20:07.820]  I highly recommend a half dry like it's one of my go tos.
[20:07.820 --> 20:11.820]  I feel like I've kind of underlined that in the industry, right?
[20:11.820 --> 20:14.820]  And I say half dry anymore because people want to fucking tie you down.
[20:14.820 --> 20:17.820]  They want to be like, what is it four and a half days, bro?
[20:17.820 --> 20:19.820]  Like, you know, it's that half dry.
[20:19.820 --> 20:27.820]  It's that when the outside of the bud just starts to get crunchy, but the inner side of the bud is still hydrated.
[20:27.820 --> 20:33.820]  You know, that's about when I'll hang my flowers, you know, 50, 50, 60, 60.
[20:33.820 --> 20:41.820]  And if I brush over that 50 degrees, 50 humidity, 60 degrees, 60 humidity in that window dry for the half, right?
[20:41.820 --> 20:45.820]  You're eight days, you're seven days, you're whatever your half dry is.
[20:45.820 --> 20:46.820]  Then buck that off.
[20:46.820 --> 20:56.820]  Here's another thing that I think we don't underline when in techniques is again, millions of little tricone heads, millions of little balls filled with oil, right?
[20:56.820 --> 20:58.820]  Be careful with that shit, man.
[20:58.820 --> 21:00.820]  Don't molest it at all.
[21:00.820 --> 21:07.820]  You know, people want to use trimmers and they want to bounce their shit and they want, no, as, as easy and as careful as you can.
[21:07.820 --> 21:12.820]  Each tricone head is another little bit of oil that you're trying to, that you're trying to extract.
[21:12.820 --> 21:15.820]  And then, and then there's the full, then there's a full dry.
[21:15.820 --> 21:22.820]  And as we progress through the, from the fresh to the half to the full dry, the tricone heads get more brittle.
[21:22.820 --> 21:25.820]  They get less sticky, less terpene content.
[21:25.820 --> 21:28.820]  So they're a little bit easier to handle.
[21:28.820 --> 21:35.820]  Yes, I said less terpene content, not to the point of degradation necessarily, but to the ease of handling, you know?
[21:35.820 --> 21:42.820]  So there's definitely some tricks, you know, when you're, when you're, they're half dry, you can probably wash in 40 degree weather.
[21:42.820 --> 21:45.820]  When you're full dry, you can maybe wash in 50 degree weather.
[21:45.820 --> 21:49.820]  That brings me to the conversation of, are you a wet trimmer or dry trimmer?
[21:49.820 --> 21:55.820]  So when I harvest, I'll take off everything with, with, without trikes.
[21:55.820 --> 21:57.820]  Everything without trikes goes away.
[21:57.820 --> 21:59.820]  And it brings me to another thing to fill in one of your blanks.
[21:59.820 --> 22:02.820]  You said you keep flower. We don't.
[22:02.820 --> 22:10.820]  We, we have a couple of plants that I grow, mimosa specifically, and a couple other very few ones that we'll actually keep for flower.
[22:10.820 --> 22:13.820]  I don't personally smoke flower, like hardly at all.
[22:13.820 --> 22:16.820]  Dizzy smokes a lot more flower than I do.
[22:16.820 --> 22:18.820]  I'm just, I'm a straight hash head.
[22:18.820 --> 22:20.820]  So we're 50-50.
[22:20.820 --> 22:25.820]  So we keep a good flower and good hash in the house.
[22:25.820 --> 22:28.820]  And, and the hash just hit me in the face and I forgot where I was going with that.
[22:30.820 --> 22:32.820]  I just took a dab and stumbled over my words.
[22:34.820 --> 22:35.820]  You don't save any of it.
[22:35.820 --> 22:37.820]  What doesn't have trichomes comes off.
[22:37.820 --> 22:39.820]  You don't save any of it for flower production.
[22:39.820 --> 22:43.820]  Perfect. And then, and then it just gets bucked straight into a bag, you know, from, from fresh.
[22:43.820 --> 22:45.820]  If it's fresh, it gets bucked straight into a bag, straight into the freezer.
[22:45.820 --> 22:49.820]  If it's half dry, it gets dried halfway, get bucked straight into a bag, into the freezer.
[22:49.820 --> 22:53.820]  If it's dried, it gets dried fully, bucked into a bag, put into the freezer.
[22:56.090 --> 23:01.090]  I'm starting to understand why I see the Rosins twice the price of other concentrates on the shelf.
[23:01.090 --> 23:08.090]  I didn't understand, but now, now that I see that you're getting, you said like a few pounds of herb gave you a very tiny amount.
[23:08.090 --> 23:09.090]  I was like, that's all you get.
[23:09.090 --> 23:12.090]  So now I kind of, I understand there's a lot of work to go into it as well.
[23:12.090 --> 23:13.090]  That's funny.
[23:13.090 --> 23:17.090]  To me, that, that number's astronomical.
[23:18.090 --> 23:23.090]  What I, what he's referring to is earlier in a podcast, I said that my critical cush on average gives me,
[23:23.090 --> 23:27.090]  if I push the limits, gives me two and a half ounces of Rosin per pound of flour.
[23:28.090 --> 23:33.090]  And if you think about the market prices on the, on the recreational market price right now,
[23:33.090 --> 23:38.090]  a flour is in the wholesale prices for flowers in the $300 range, you know?
[23:38.090 --> 23:44.090]  So a wholesale pricing for Rosin is in the 15 to $30 a gram range.
[23:44.090 --> 23:46.090]  So you can do the math and you can see it quickly adds up.
[23:47.090 --> 23:48.090]  All right.
[23:48.090 --> 23:52.090]  I see good Rosin on shelves for $80, $120 a gram for the top shelf shit.
[23:52.090 --> 23:54.090]  I see that's what it's all about here too.
[23:55.090 --> 24:00.090]  Massachusetts and our surrounding States are 80 to a hundred dollars a gram for good Rosin.
[24:00.090 --> 24:01.090]  Yeah.
[24:01.090 --> 24:05.090]  And I was, I was referring to the wholesale side, the, not the purchase price.
[24:05.090 --> 24:06.090]  Absolutely.
[24:06.090 --> 24:07.090]  Yeah.
[24:07.090 --> 24:08.090]  You guys don't come here thinking you're going to get it for the price page.
[24:09.090 --> 24:10.090]  Yeah.
[24:10.090 --> 24:12.090]  That is, that's wholesale on the recreational market.
[24:12.090 --> 24:13.090]  That's why I said that.
[24:13.090 --> 24:18.090]  Cause I'm starting, I didn't, I didn't mention that in the, in the intro and cause I don't,
[24:19.090 --> 24:21.090]  we're still in kind of the infancy phases and everything.
[24:21.090 --> 24:26.090]  I'm busting my ass, putting in crazy hours, but we are entering the recreational and med market.
[24:27.090 --> 24:32.090]  We, as in Pedro, I guess I say we, and it's like looking at who the fuck's behind me.
[24:33.090 --> 24:36.090]  It's a grow, grow up.
[24:37.090 --> 24:38.090]  It's a grow up in parachute.
[24:38.090 --> 24:39.090]  It's Eden extracts.
[24:40.090 --> 24:43.090]  It's Eden supernatural gardening or supernatural gardens.
[24:44.090 --> 24:49.090]  And yeah, we're moving into, you know, people have been asking me for years if they can purchase my Rosin.
[24:49.090 --> 24:51.090]  And the answer is resoundingly, no, I'm sorry.
[24:52.090 --> 24:53.090]  You can't.
[24:53.090 --> 24:57.090]  But soon to be, you will be able to purchase Rosin that I've actually made.
[24:58.090 --> 24:59.090]  Excellent.
[24:59.090 --> 25:00.090]  The world, the world will look forward to that.
[25:01.090 --> 25:02.090]  Very cool.
[25:02.090 --> 25:03.090]  Hit the rec market with that Pedro Rosin.
[25:04.090 --> 25:05.090]  I love it.
[25:05.090 --> 25:06.090]  People can come talk about what I've been talking about.
[25:07.090 --> 25:08.090]  The stuff that changed my opinion on Rosin.
[25:09.090 --> 25:10.090]  That's, that's crazy to hear.
[25:10.090 --> 25:11.090]  That's that's crazy for me.
[25:11.090 --> 25:13.090]  I was going to say, he's going to have to send me a little bit so I can sample that possibly.
[25:14.090 --> 25:15.090]  Allegedly.
[25:15.090 --> 25:16.090]  Well, allegedly.
[25:17.090 --> 25:18.090]  Allegedly.
[25:18.090 --> 25:19.090]  We'll all meet at the Denver airport.
[25:20.090 --> 25:21.090]  Yeah, there we go.
[25:21.090 --> 25:22.090]  There we go.
[25:22.090 --> 25:23.090]  Just for the sake of recording purposes, you know.
[25:24.090 --> 25:28.090]  So we were in the middle of talking about the half dry process.
[25:29.090 --> 25:32.090]  We got to, I don't even remember where we got to because I'm not a concentrate maker.
[25:33.090 --> 25:34.090]  I don't know if you were done with that part.
[25:35.090 --> 25:36.090]  I don't think you remember either.
[25:37.090 --> 25:38.090]  No, I was pretty much done with that.
[25:38.090 --> 25:41.090]  I think it's literally just differences in climates.
[25:42.090 --> 25:46.090]  Not literally just, but it's differences in climates that I wanted to kind of underline.
[25:46.090 --> 25:52.090]  And I wanted to underline the point that people that are just starting to do this should absolutely not start with fresh frozen.
[25:53.090 --> 25:56.090]  That is just an underlined do not do it, period.
[25:57.090 --> 25:59.090]  Start with, start with dried.
[26:00.090 --> 26:05.090]  If you want to get crazy and think you're somebody, then go ahead and do it the half frozen, but pay attention to what I just said.
[26:06.090 --> 26:07.090]  Or not the half frozen, the half dry.
[26:08.090 --> 26:09.090]  But pay attention to what I just said.
[26:10.090 --> 26:14.090]  I would highly recommend anybody that's starting to wash their first wash, washes dry material.
[26:15.090 --> 26:17.090]  How dry, like cured or just dry?
[26:18.090 --> 26:19.090]  Just dry.
[26:19.090 --> 26:20.090]  Just dry.
[26:20.090 --> 26:21.090]  Just dry.
[26:21.090 --> 26:22.090]  Yeah.
[26:22.090 --> 26:30.090]  I always, when I'm processing for rosin, it's either fresh bag freezer, half dry bag freezer, or dry bag freezer.
[26:31.090 --> 26:33.090]  And that doesn't mean dry and cure bag freeze.
[26:33.090 --> 26:34.090]  It's dry, then freezer.
[26:35.090 --> 26:36.090]  Agreed.
[26:36.090 --> 26:41.090]  And that freezing process, from what I understand, that's like, and this is scary to say, just because I'm a guy with dreadlocks.
[26:41.090 --> 26:45.090]  It kind of thinks of if you get gum in your hair or something, you used to freeze the gum and it would come out of your hair.
[26:45.090 --> 26:49.090]  It's kind of the same idea I get when you talk about breaking those trichome heads off in the freeze.
[26:49.090 --> 26:50.090]  Is that correct?
[26:50.090 --> 26:51.090]  Yes.
[26:51.090 --> 26:54.090]  Which is why we underline being careful with it.
[26:54.090 --> 27:02.090]  When I take it out of the freezer, I don't throw the shit over my shoulder and fucking walk into the, you know, it's very delicate process because I want to collect those trichome heads.
[27:02.090 --> 27:03.090]  I thought a weed Santa would do that.
[27:03.090 --> 27:04.090]  Same thing when you're trimming.
[27:04.090 --> 27:06.090]  Definitely saw a weed Santa.
[27:06.090 --> 27:07.090]  And he said it right there.
[27:08.090 --> 27:20.090]  And when you're trimming, when you're handling it, when you're everything, you know, when I bring someone into my grow to harvest or to help me with the process of pre, you know, basically harvest.
[27:20.090 --> 27:26.090]  If I see a lot of resin all over your gloves and shit, we're going to have a little bit of a talk.
[27:26.090 --> 27:27.090]  Yeah.
[27:27.090 --> 27:28.090]  What are you doing to those buds?
[27:28.090 --> 27:29.090]  Yeah.
[27:29.090 --> 27:30.090]  Stop molesting my shit, bro.
[27:30.090 --> 27:31.090]  Exactly.
[27:31.090 --> 27:33.090]  At least half a gram on your fingers right there.
[27:33.090 --> 27:34.090]  Yeah.
[27:34.090 --> 27:36.090]  So if super cold is one, go ahead, Ryan.
[27:36.090 --> 27:37.090]  I don't mean to cut you off.
[27:37.090 --> 27:39.090]  I was gonna say that's what I feel like wet trimming.
[27:39.090 --> 27:43.090]  Honestly, there's you got a little bit less handling and those trichomes are a little less brittle.
[27:43.090 --> 27:49.090]  I think when they're wet, too, I feel like everything's more intact and just better overall.
[27:49.090 --> 27:50.090]  If you're doing a wet trim, if you're going to watch.
[27:50.090 --> 27:51.090]  See, that makes sense.
[27:51.090 --> 27:55.090]  For me, trimming is only a flower thing.
[27:55.090 --> 28:00.090]  If I'm going to, if I'm going to a rosin, there's trim doesn't happen.
[28:00.090 --> 28:01.090]  If that makes sense.
[28:01.090 --> 28:02.090]  There's a hardest word.
[28:02.090 --> 28:03.090]  I'm doing flower and rosin.
[28:03.090 --> 28:04.090]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[28:04.090 --> 28:05.090]  For me.
[28:05.090 --> 28:06.090]  Yeah.
[28:06.090 --> 28:08.090]  So you're trimming is just you don't, but you probably don't trim your lowers, right?
[28:08.090 --> 28:09.090]  You just throw that into the bag.
[28:09.090 --> 28:10.090]  No.
[28:10.090 --> 28:11.090]  Yeah.
[28:11.090 --> 28:14.090]  So, so for your rosin, you're not trimming.
[28:14.090 --> 28:15.090]  Correct.
[28:15.090 --> 28:16.090]  Yep.
[28:16.090 --> 28:19.090]  All my lowers, larvae, anything that has zero bag appeal, dude, right to the hatchback.
[28:19.090 --> 28:20.090]  Yeah, for sure.
[28:20.090 --> 28:24.090]  Literally my entire heart, my every bit of my harvest go right into the freezer.
[28:24.090 --> 28:25.090]  It's pretty crazy.
[28:25.090 --> 28:29.090]  I want that freeze dryer too, brother, or that cold room.
[28:29.090 --> 28:31.090]  That was going to be my next question.
[28:31.090 --> 28:32.090]  I'd love to have that stuff.
[28:32.090 --> 28:34.090]  Ryan, Ryan just segued for me.
[28:34.090 --> 28:35.090]  We're trying to keep the stuff cold.
[28:35.090 --> 28:38.090]  Is freeze drying this bud an option?
[28:38.090 --> 28:39.090]  Is that something that's useful?
[28:39.090 --> 28:42.090]  Ooh, you got excited about that.
[28:42.090 --> 28:43.090]  Yeah.
[28:43.090 --> 28:44.090]  All right.
[28:44.090 --> 28:46.090]  It's something that has been talked about a lot.
[28:46.090 --> 28:48.090]  Controversial as well.
[28:48.090 --> 28:50.090]  And maybe not enough.
[28:50.090 --> 28:52.090]  I think yes, it's true.
[28:52.090 --> 28:53.090]  Super controversial.
[28:53.090 --> 29:00.090]  I think that for smoking flower, freeze drying your buds is not applicable.
[29:01.090 --> 29:03.090]  You're locking a lot of stuff in the plant.
[29:03.090 --> 29:07.090]  You're just removing moisture, but you're locking a lot of stuff in the plant that would
[29:07.090 --> 29:11.090]  otherwise off gas and dry.
[29:11.090 --> 29:12.090]  Chlorophyll.
[29:12.090 --> 29:13.090]  Yeah.
[29:13.090 --> 29:14.090]  Chlorophyll.
[29:14.090 --> 29:16.090]  That was the one big thing I was thinking about.
[29:16.090 --> 29:17.090]  Chlorophyll.
[29:17.090 --> 29:18.090]  Exactly.
[29:18.090 --> 29:19.090]  Chlorophyll.
[29:19.090 --> 29:20.090]  It tastes like green bug.
[29:20.090 --> 29:25.090]  That being said, if we're not smoking the flower, we're just collecting the trichome
[29:25.090 --> 29:28.090]  heads, is that a viable option?
[29:28.090 --> 29:35.090]  You get very dry, dense, or not dry, dense, very dry, brittle buds and trikes.
[29:38.090 --> 29:41.090]  It's viable, but God damn, think about the price, man.
[29:41.090 --> 29:46.090]  It's 36 hours for a freeze dry session, and you can probably put a half a pound in a big
[29:46.090 --> 29:47.090]  freeze dryer.
[29:50.090 --> 29:51.090]  It's very interesting.
[29:51.090 --> 29:53.090]  You guys want to spend $300 a gram?
[29:53.090 --> 29:54.090]  Man.
[29:54.090 --> 29:55.090]  So no.
[29:55.090 --> 30:02.090]  Viable, but possible with the tools and freeze dryers and stuff that we have right now, no.
[30:02.090 --> 30:03.090]  For freeze drying flower.
[30:03.090 --> 30:10.090]  Now, freeze drying the hash, as far as I'm concerned, that's the big step up in quality.
[30:10.090 --> 30:11.090]  Absolutely.
[30:11.090 --> 30:12.090]  Definitely next level.
[30:12.090 --> 30:17.090]  That's another thing we can talk about is how you actually dry and process afterwards
[30:17.090 --> 30:18.090]  after we wash.
[30:18.090 --> 30:20.090]  For me, I'm a home grower.
[30:20.090 --> 30:21.090]  Freeze dryers are expensive.
[30:21.090 --> 30:23.090]  That's a tough thing for me.
[30:23.090 --> 30:29.090]  For me, that was a big step to learn as well, just to preserve those terpenes.
[30:29.090 --> 30:35.090]  For me, I don't even press it right out of the bag pretty much on the pressing screens.
[30:35.090 --> 30:36.090]  I keep it in a ball.
[30:36.090 --> 30:39.090]  I fresh freeze it, and I got to microplane the crap out of it.
[30:39.090 --> 30:44.090]  That's the only way I really can do it, just flash freeze it, microplane it, make it that
[30:44.090 --> 30:48.090]  sandy material pretty much scattered across a piece of parchment paper, and dry it as
[30:48.090 --> 30:52.090]  fast as you possibly can in a 24-hour period, but at a cooler temperature.
[30:52.090 --> 30:54.090]  Pizza box tech?
[30:54.090 --> 30:56.090]  Kind of.
[30:56.090 --> 31:01.090]  I microplane it, put it on a big piece of parchment paper, and I just set it on a counter
[31:01.090 --> 31:04.090]  in a garage at 40, 50 degrees, and it's pretty much dry by the next day.
[31:04.090 --> 31:09.090]  It's very low relative humidity here, so it's pretty much ready to rock by the next day.
[31:09.090 --> 31:13.090]  A lot of people will also use, they'll put that parchment inside pizza boxes.
[31:13.090 --> 31:15.090]  For the cardboard and drywall.
[31:15.090 --> 31:16.090]  That makes sense.
[31:16.090 --> 31:17.090]  Absolutely.
[31:17.090 --> 31:18.090]  It pulls more moisture out.
[31:18.090 --> 31:20.090]  The microplaning is when you turn it into dust, basically, right?
[31:20.090 --> 31:23.090]  You use the little file and turn it to sand?
[31:23.090 --> 31:24.090]  Yes.
[31:24.090 --> 31:26.090]  Like a lemon zester.
[31:26.090 --> 31:28.090]  He breezed over that.
[31:28.090 --> 31:33.090]  That is a much more arduous task than he said.
[31:33.090 --> 31:42.090]  Do you have a big frozen ball of stickiness that you're trying to microplane before it
[31:42.090 --> 31:45.090]  gets too sticky, so back to cold, right?
[31:45.090 --> 31:46.090]  Yes.
[31:47.090 --> 31:50.090]  How many times do you put that thing back in the freezer while you're microplaning?
[31:50.090 --> 31:52.090]  Five, four, five times at least.
[31:52.090 --> 31:53.090]  Exactly.
[31:53.090 --> 31:55.090]  How many minutes between those times?
[31:55.090 --> 32:00.090]  It'll take me probably an hour to microplane it, just because I have to keep refreezing it.
[32:00.090 --> 32:06.090]  And with the air drying, you have oxidation, you're losing terpene content, the whole nine yards.
[32:06.090 --> 32:07.090]  Color.
[32:07.090 --> 32:08.090]  Color, absolutely.
[32:08.090 --> 32:09.090]  Absolutely.
[32:09.090 --> 32:12.090]  But that freeze dryer, man, two grand, that's a hard buy.
[32:13.090 --> 32:16.090]  I know, it was a tough buy, but one of the best I've ever made.
[32:16.090 --> 32:19.090]  You can get by with a small one.
[32:19.090 --> 32:20.090]  You can get by with a small one.
[32:20.090 --> 32:23.090]  So don't feel like you need a big, expensive ball.
[32:23.090 --> 32:24.090]  You can get by with a small one.
[32:24.090 --> 32:26.090]  It'll change your game.
[32:26.090 --> 32:27.090]  Oh, trust me.
[32:27.090 --> 32:29.090]  That's on top of the list, buddy.
[32:29.090 --> 32:30.090]  It's awesome.
[32:30.090 --> 32:31.090]  It's really nice.
[32:31.090 --> 32:32.090]  Next Christmas.
[32:32.090 --> 32:33.090]  Yeah, right?
[32:33.090 --> 32:35.090]  Next three Christmases.
[32:38.090 --> 32:41.090]  So we've gotten through the frozen, the half dry.
[32:41.090 --> 32:49.090]  I think it's time to kind of explain the process of harvesting and turning our dry product into a smokable concentrate.
[32:49.090 --> 32:51.090]  Yeah, into a smokable rosin.
[32:51.090 --> 32:53.090]  I'm trying to use the right words now that I've been educated.
[32:53.090 --> 32:55.090]  Yeah, yeah, no worries.
[32:55.090 --> 32:57.090]  Cold, cold water.
[32:57.090 --> 32:59.090]  This is the fun part.
[32:59.090 --> 33:03.090]  We are, some people will say, oh, water is a universal solvent, so how are we solventless, right?
[33:03.090 --> 33:04.090]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[33:04.090 --> 33:08.090]  A solvent is only a solvent when it's used to dissolve.
[33:08.090 --> 33:09.090]  Let's say we're using it mechanically.
[33:10.090 --> 33:13.090]  We're not using the water to dissolve our extract.
[33:13.090 --> 33:15.090]  We're using it as a carrier, right?
[33:15.090 --> 33:18.090]  We're using it just literally as a medium.
[33:18.090 --> 33:25.090]  So we're solventless, and we're using that cold, the brittleness properties of that trichome head.
[33:25.090 --> 33:34.090]  Hopefully, at least we discussed a little bit in the pre-show regarding a stocked trichome head and a bulbous trichome head,
[33:34.090 --> 33:40.090]  where it's literally just a bulb of a trichome head on the leaf itself, where there is no stock.
[33:40.090 --> 33:43.090]  That doesn't wash well at all.
[33:43.090 --> 33:45.090]  You definitely need stocked trichome heads.
[33:45.090 --> 33:48.090]  That's what's going to give you your better yield.
[33:48.090 --> 33:56.090]  You literally dump your flour into water, agitate it, and collect the water.
[33:56.090 --> 33:58.090]  And don't over-agitate it.
[33:58.090 --> 34:00.090]  In the simplest form.
[34:00.090 --> 34:03.090]  Now, we can get into ice content in the water.
[34:03.090 --> 34:05.090]  We can get into a temperature of the water.
[34:05.090 --> 34:09.090]  We can get into agitation practices, whether it's mechanical or hand.
[34:09.090 --> 34:11.090]  We can get into time vegetation.
[34:11.090 --> 34:13.090]  We can get into collecting techniques.
[34:13.090 --> 34:14.090]  There's a lot.
[34:14.090 --> 34:16.090]  There's a lot, a lot to it.
[34:16.090 --> 34:21.090]  But for the simplest, dumbed-down explanation, it's in water.
[34:21.090 --> 34:27.090]  It's agitated, cold, and we collect the trichome heads that have collected in the water at the end.
[34:28.090 --> 34:33.090]  And those trichome heads will be in the different size bags with the different micron screens in the bottom of them.
[34:33.090 --> 34:34.090]  Okay.
[34:34.090 --> 34:36.090]  Ryan said don't over-agitate it.
[34:36.090 --> 34:38.090]  I've made bubble hash before.
[34:38.090 --> 34:40.090]  I was taught by the legendary Subcool.
[34:40.090 --> 34:42.090]  I used his bubble bag method.
[34:42.090 --> 34:45.090]  Subby taught us to agitate the shit out of it.
[34:45.090 --> 34:47.090]  Subbeat the shit out of his father's flour.
[34:47.090 --> 34:48.090]  He sure did.
[34:48.090 --> 34:51.090]  A lot of guys used to use paint mixers on drills.
[34:51.090 --> 34:52.090]  That's what I was going to hit you with.
[34:52.090 --> 34:53.090]  That makes me cringe.
[34:53.090 --> 34:56.090]  I did it once, and I was like, holy shit, what is going on?
[34:56.090 --> 34:57.090]  Me too.
[34:57.090 --> 34:59.090]  Then I looked at my bag, and everything was green.
[34:59.090 --> 35:00.090]  Okay.
[35:00.090 --> 35:01.090]  Chlorophyll.
[35:01.090 --> 35:02.090]  That's exactly what I expected.
[35:02.090 --> 35:03.090]  Chlorophyll.
[35:03.090 --> 35:04.090]  He beat that one out.
[35:04.090 --> 35:05.090]  So when we get into this.
[35:05.090 --> 35:07.090]  It's definitely a look, a feel, a touch.
[35:07.090 --> 35:13.090]  It's definitely doing it multiple times, watching that water, watching what's actually going on.
[35:13.090 --> 35:15.090]  It's not the same time every time.
[35:15.090 --> 35:17.090]  It's not the same time with every pheno.
[35:17.090 --> 35:19.090]  It's different for every strain, every pheno, exactly.
[35:19.090 --> 35:22.090]  It's definitely a look, a feel.
[35:23.090 --> 35:26.090]  It's something that you got to know just by doing it.
[35:26.090 --> 35:27.090]  Absolutely.
[35:27.090 --> 35:30.090]  Yeah, I agree 100%.
[35:30.090 --> 35:34.090]  I think I understand the process of the sieve bags, the bubble bags.
[35:34.090 --> 35:35.090]  Now, I've got bubble.
[35:35.090 --> 35:38.090]  I called it bubble hash back in the day, because we used bubble bags to make it.
[35:38.090 --> 35:40.090]  It bubbles when you make it, or when you burn it.
[35:40.090 --> 35:42.090]  It melts when you light it up.
[35:42.090 --> 35:45.090]  What do I do if I want to turn that into rosin?
[35:45.090 --> 35:48.090]  This is the part where I am lost.
[35:48.090 --> 35:51.090]  What do I do to turn my bag wash into rosin?
[35:51.090 --> 35:52.090]  How do we press this stuff?
[35:52.090 --> 35:54.090]  I have no idea how to do that part.
[35:54.090 --> 36:03.090]  After I get my hash out of the water, I put it in the best consistency I can say is a pancake-type consistency.
[36:03.090 --> 36:08.090]  When my hash comes out of the bags, let's step back a little bit more and talk about those collection bags.
[36:08.090 --> 36:09.090]  Yes.
[36:09.090 --> 36:12.090]  Yes, bubble bags, Bubble Man.
[36:12.090 --> 36:17.090]  As a matter of fact, the funny thing is I did an interview with Bubble Man himself.
[36:18.090 --> 36:28.090]  The first bags that I purchased some 20 years ago were hand-stitched by his wife, which is just freaking cool as shit.
[36:28.090 --> 36:31.090]  She was hand-stitching them in her living room at the time.
[36:31.090 --> 36:33.090]  There are bags.
[36:33.090 --> 36:34.090]  There's a 25 micron.
[36:34.090 --> 36:46.090]  Now, this varies with manufacturer, but for the most part, there's a 25, there's a 45, there's a 73, there's a 90, there's a 120, there's a 160, there's a 190.
[36:46.090 --> 36:47.090]  There's a 220.
[36:47.090 --> 36:49.090]  That's like the general.
[36:49.090 --> 36:58.090]  They'll be off on a couple micron sizes on different manufacturers, but that's about a round ball.
[36:58.090 --> 37:09.090]  As a whole, most people and most phenos will collect somewhere in the 45 to 159 range.
[37:09.090 --> 37:11.090]  That might be 73 to 159.
[37:11.090 --> 37:13.090]  It might be 90 to 159.
[37:13.090 --> 37:15.090]  It might be 90 to 120.
[37:16.090 --> 37:21.090]  Essentially, what the micron size is, is it's a whole size in the bag.
[37:21.090 --> 37:27.090]  It will let through anything smaller than 73 microns, than 93 microns.
[37:27.090 --> 37:31.090]  It will hold everything bigger than that.
[37:31.090 --> 37:33.090]  You can use all eight bags.
[37:33.090 --> 37:34.090]  You can use four bags.
[37:34.090 --> 37:36.090]  You can use really whatever you want.
[37:36.090 --> 37:41.090]  I've taught a lot of people in the past to use the 25, the 45, the 160, and the 220.
[37:41.090 --> 37:42.090]  That's it.
[37:42.090 --> 37:49.090]  You can collect your 45 through 159 and have a beautiful, I call it broad spectrum.
[37:49.090 --> 37:51.090]  I never call it full spectrum.
[37:51.090 --> 37:52.090]  That's a whole other conversation.
[37:52.090 --> 37:54.090]  Full spectrum is smoking flour.
[37:54.090 --> 37:58.090]  You can have a very broad spectrum concentrate.
[37:58.090 --> 38:05.090]  Then as you pull it down into the 90 to 120, you've got a way more isolated spectrum product.
[38:05.090 --> 38:08.090]  My 73 and my 120 are my sweet spot.
[38:08.090 --> 38:09.090]  Yeah, usually they swell up to right for me.
[38:09.090 --> 38:12.090]  Notice the 90 and 120 sell the best at the dispensary.
[38:12.090 --> 38:13.090]  Yeah.
[38:13.090 --> 38:14.090]  Now here's the other thing.
[38:14.090 --> 38:21.090]  When you start isolating heads in a 90 bag, let's say you're using all of the eight bags,
[38:21.090 --> 38:23.090]  and you're going to isolate the 90 to 120.
[38:23.090 --> 38:27.090]  You're no longer getting that two and a half ounces per pound of the 90 to 120.
[38:27.090 --> 38:32.090]  That two and a half ounces is all of your rosin.
[38:32.090 --> 38:36.090]  Now if you start taking just this little bit, now you've got what?
[38:36.090 --> 38:40.090]  Eight ounces or eight grams or whatever the numbers is, right?
[38:40.090 --> 38:42.090]  Of high quality.
[38:42.090 --> 38:45.090]  That's why the shit's costing you $150 a gram.
[38:45.090 --> 38:47.090]  You want me to burst the-
[38:47.090 --> 38:50.090]  That's why we don't sell it and we don't share.
[38:50.090 --> 38:57.090]  You want me to burst the bubble, I think the 90, the 120, the 73, the isolated bags is hype.
[38:59.090 --> 39:01.090]  Can you tell me why?
[39:01.090 --> 39:04.090]  Yeah, because everybody started this smoking flour, right?
[39:05.090 --> 39:06.090]  That's your full spectrum.
[39:06.090 --> 39:09.090]  That's getting every cannabinoid that the plant has to offer.
[39:09.090 --> 39:12.090]  Well, I don't want to say every cannabinoid, but that's getting the vast majority of the cannabinoids
[39:12.090 --> 39:14.090]  that the plant has to offer in your system.
[39:14.090 --> 39:21.090]  When you start isolating things and not even burning plant material, you've lost full spectrum.
[39:21.090 --> 39:24.090]  You've just went down to broad at best.
[39:24.090 --> 39:34.090]  Every time you take a step into a smaller size, 90 to 120, a smaller bag size, a smaller pull,
[39:34.090 --> 39:36.090]  you've isolated cannabinoids.
[39:36.090 --> 39:40.090]  You're no longer getting that full high.
[39:40.090 --> 39:41.090]  You might only get a heady high.
[39:41.090 --> 39:42.090]  You might go to sleep.
[39:42.090 --> 39:44.090]  It's going to be different for every plant.
[39:48.090 --> 39:50.090]  I started to do the 45 to 159.
[39:50.090 --> 39:56.090]  I do believe there's value in pulling the 45 out and going to the 73 to 120 or 73 to 159.
[39:56.090 --> 40:01.090]  I do believe there's some subtle nuances and benefits to doing that.
[40:01.090 --> 40:05.090]  But I think the more that we isolate the heads and we isolate the cannabinoids,
[40:05.090 --> 40:08.090]  we're stepping away from that full body high.
[40:10.090 --> 40:12.090]  I can agree with that.
[40:12.090 --> 40:13.090]  I would agree too.
[40:13.090 --> 40:17.090]  I noticed that some concentrates definitely make me super droopy-eyed and super lazy.
[40:17.090 --> 40:19.090]  And then some will definitely get me bug-eyed and moving.
[40:19.090 --> 40:26.090]  And I noticed that there's not the full experience that you get from some other delivery methods for sure.
[40:26.090 --> 40:28.090]  And some people want that.
[40:28.090 --> 40:31.090]  And that's a great thing to know and to desire.
[40:31.090 --> 40:33.090]  But just be educated.
[40:35.090 --> 40:36.090]  So we've done our press.
[40:36.090 --> 40:38.090]  Let's get back to our wash.
[40:38.090 --> 40:40.090]  How do we press this stuff?
[40:40.090 --> 40:41.090]  No, you're good.
[40:41.090 --> 40:42.090]  We're all stoned here.
[40:42.090 --> 40:43.090]  I'll get us back on track.
[40:43.090 --> 40:44.090]  That's my job.
[40:44.090 --> 40:45.090]  You ramble all day.
[40:45.090 --> 40:46.090]  I like the info.
[40:46.090 --> 40:47.090]  I'll never cut you off.
[40:47.090 --> 40:48.090]  You keep going.
[40:48.090 --> 40:50.090]  Seriously, I can listen to him all day long.
[40:50.090 --> 40:52.090]  Yeah, when I cut you off, the listeners start to watch themselves.
[40:52.090 --> 40:53.090]  From one hash maker to another.
[40:53.090 --> 40:54.090]  Absolutely.
[40:54.090 --> 40:55.090]  Appreciate it.
[40:55.090 --> 40:57.090]  So we've isolated our bags, whatever bags we have.
[40:57.090 --> 41:02.090]  We've got hash that we're ready to press, whether it's your 73, whether it's your 90, whether it's your broad spectrum.
[41:02.090 --> 41:08.090]  I'm going to say we've got beach sand quality hash sitting in front of us.
[41:08.090 --> 41:12.090]  Whether it's been micro-planed and the sand particles are a little bigger, whatever.
[41:12.090 --> 41:14.090]  We've all got beach sand in front of us.
[41:15.090 --> 41:17.090]  For me, everything I use is Rosin Evolution.
[41:17.090 --> 41:18.090]  Sorry, it's a plug.
[41:18.090 --> 41:20.090]  I use them all day long, every day.
[41:20.090 --> 41:26.090]  I'll use the two by four and a half inch bags.
[41:26.090 --> 41:31.090]  And in a two by four and a half inch bag, I will put 20 grams of hash.
[41:31.090 --> 41:35.090]  That's in a 25 micron bag.
[41:35.090 --> 41:37.090]  Boy, there's a whole other story.
[41:37.090 --> 41:38.090]  The bags have micron sizes too.
[41:38.090 --> 41:42.090]  The Rosin Filter bags have micron sizes, right?
[41:42.090 --> 41:44.090]  Do you double your bags as well?
[41:44.090 --> 41:46.090]  I triple them, actually.
[41:46.090 --> 41:48.090]  I do 37 micron doubles.
[41:48.090 --> 41:52.090]  I do 225s in a 160.
[41:52.090 --> 41:58.090]  And I just ordered and have them sitting over here right next to me 15 microns.
[41:58.090 --> 42:00.090]  So I'm going to play around with some 15 microns as well.
[42:00.090 --> 42:06.090]  I'm figuring if it's oil, why do we want a micron size anyways?
[42:06.090 --> 42:08.090]  This is true.
[42:08.090 --> 42:11.090]  Take out the lipids for the most part, right?
[42:11.090 --> 42:12.090]  That's the main.
[42:12.090 --> 42:13.090]  Yep.
[42:13.090 --> 42:19.090]  So if we're getting down to 15 microns instead of 25, we're potentially even removing it more undesirables.
[42:19.090 --> 42:20.090]  Even more, absolutely.
[42:20.090 --> 42:23.090]  So that being said, there's different micron sizes.
[42:23.090 --> 42:27.090]  Back when we used to press flour, Christ, we used to press flour in a 90 micron or a 120 micron.
[42:27.090 --> 42:30.090]  And those days are funny to think back on.
[42:30.090 --> 42:34.090]  Now we'll take 20 grams and we'll put it in a 25 micron bag.
[42:34.090 --> 42:37.090]  I'll slip that in another 25 micron bag.
[42:38.090 --> 42:41.090]  Double filtration, double blowout prevention.
[42:41.090 --> 42:43.090]  And then I will always put that in a 160.
[42:43.090 --> 42:46.090]  The 160 is extra blowout protection.
[42:46.090 --> 42:49.090]  There's no filtration with the 160 whatsoever.
[42:49.090 --> 42:56.090]  The thing that it does that people don't give enough credit to is bag slippage.
[42:56.090 --> 43:03.090]  When you put your bags into a 160 and put them on the parchment, they won't slip anymore.
[43:03.090 --> 43:07.090]  What I mean by that, anybody that's ever pressed hash has had a blowout.
[43:07.090 --> 43:13.090]  If your bag is not centered on your plates or at least within the square inches of your plates,
[43:13.090 --> 43:19.090]  if any part of that bag comes out of that press area, you will have a blowout.
[43:19.090 --> 43:24.090]  All of your hash will go to that little spot and it will literally, you will have hash shoot at your face.
[43:24.090 --> 43:26.090]  It's not a great thing.
[43:26.090 --> 43:28.090]  And it won't be the nice same color as the rest of it.
[43:28.090 --> 43:30.090]  No, it's pretty horrible.
[43:31.090 --> 43:36.090]  When I do it in the 225s, that's double blowout prevention, double filtration.
[43:36.090 --> 43:39.090]  And then the 160 is blowout prevention, but also slippage.
[43:39.090 --> 43:41.090]  The bag stays put.
[43:41.090 --> 43:46.090]  And man, I've been doing it that way religiously for a couple of years now.
[43:46.090 --> 43:48.090]  That's a good tip, man. I like that.
[43:48.090 --> 43:52.090]  And then time, temperature, pressure.
[43:52.090 --> 43:53.090]  That's what I just wrote.
[43:53.090 --> 43:54.090]  Yep.
[43:54.090 --> 43:56.090]  Time, temp, time, and weight.
[43:57.090 --> 44:02.090]  So now we're, again, depends, depends, depends, depends, depends.
[44:02.090 --> 44:05.090]  This is why we are who we are, I guess.
[44:05.090 --> 44:06.090]  Strain dependent again.
[44:06.090 --> 44:07.090]  Yep.
[44:07.090 --> 44:09.090]  So somewhere between the, some people get crazy.
[44:09.090 --> 44:11.090]  Some people go down to 150s, 160s.
[44:11.090 --> 44:14.090]  170, 180 for hash.
[44:14.090 --> 44:17.090]  That's where I'm at, 180, almost religiously 180.
[44:17.090 --> 44:18.090]  170, 180.
[44:18.090 --> 44:24.090]  Sometimes if the hash is looking weird, I'll bump to 190 just to see what the hell's going on.
[44:25.090 --> 44:29.090]  But man, I see people pressing at 210, 220.
[44:29.090 --> 44:31.090]  I'm like, whoa, bro, do you see the bubbles?
[44:31.090 --> 44:32.090]  Yeah, that's a little much.
[44:32.090 --> 44:35.090]  Do you understand what bubbling rosin means?
[44:35.090 --> 44:37.090]  Unless we're talking flour, that's a different topic.
[44:37.090 --> 44:38.090]  Yeah, right?
[44:38.090 --> 44:40.090]  That bubbling should happen after I paid for it.
[44:40.090 --> 44:42.090]  Yes, yeah. The bubbling is literally the-
[44:42.090 --> 44:43.090]  That's where it should be happening.
[44:43.090 --> 44:44.090]  The bubbling-
[44:44.090 --> 44:45.090]  It should be in the banger.
[44:45.090 --> 44:49.090]  If you're bubbling on the press, you're degrading your rosin horribly, horribly.
[44:49.090 --> 44:51.090]  If you're pressing above 190, you're degrading your rosin.
[44:51.090 --> 44:53.090]  That's where you get that burnt popcorn, bud.
[44:53.090 --> 44:56.090]  One of my notes is how to avoid the burnt popcorn flavor.
[44:56.090 --> 44:58.090]  Don't go above 190.
[44:58.090 --> 44:59.090]  Don't go above 190.
[44:59.090 --> 45:00.090]  Don't go above 180.
[45:00.090 --> 45:03.090]  Try to stay below the 180, 190 mark.
[45:03.090 --> 45:04.090]  Yeah.
[45:04.090 --> 45:06.090]  And then temperature or time.
[45:06.090 --> 45:13.090]  Time, if you really want the very specifics, this is one of the things that I've done since the beginning
[45:13.090 --> 45:15.090]  that's kind of underlined who I am.
[45:15.090 --> 45:21.090]  When you go to the rosin.is.legal.fuckers account, I tell you all this.
[45:21.090 --> 45:27.090]  I've pressed at 82 degrees Celsius for two and a half minutes at this amount of pressure at the bag.
[45:27.090 --> 45:31.090]  Man, bag pressure is another thing, too.
[45:31.090 --> 45:33.090]  I said that, and it's just like-
[45:33.090 --> 45:34.090]  And slow pressure.
[45:34.090 --> 45:37.090]  When you're pressing, Cash, that's another thing we should talk about.
[45:37.090 --> 45:38.090]  Get that slow pressure.
[45:38.090 --> 45:40.090]  Don't freaking squeeze the hell out of it.
[45:40.090 --> 45:41.090]  You're going to blow those bags out.
[45:41.090 --> 45:43.090]  That's why we're doubling, tripling them up.
[45:43.090 --> 45:44.090]  Big thing.
[45:44.090 --> 45:45.090]  And same thing with flour.
[45:45.090 --> 45:49.090]  If we're talking about flour, I press on a 37 as well for flour.
[45:50.090 --> 45:54.090]  If you're pressing wetter flour or something that's just dry, go slower.
[45:54.090 --> 45:56.090]  You're going to blow those bags out if it's fresh.
[45:57.090 --> 45:58.090]  That makes sense.
[46:02.510 --> 46:03.510]  I don't press flour.
[46:04.510 --> 46:05.510]  Don't generally.
[46:07.510 --> 46:09.510]  I don't ever either, really.
[46:12.510 --> 46:16.510]  Is that why a lot of the rosin that I smoke, and I'm not trying to be a hater here,
[46:16.510 --> 46:21.510]  is that why a lot of the rosin I smoke tastes like straight Popsicle sticks and burnt popcorn?
[46:21.510 --> 46:22.510]  Or yeah, what is it?
[46:22.510 --> 46:24.510]  A Popsicle stick or burnt popcorn or a woody-
[46:24.510 --> 46:25.510]  Are you smoking flour rosin?
[46:25.510 --> 46:26.510]  Yes.
[46:26.510 --> 46:27.510]  That's probably what I'm assuming.
[46:27.510 --> 46:28.510]  Because I don't make it.
[46:28.510 --> 46:29.510]  I don't know.
[46:29.510 --> 46:30.510]  People bring me gifts.
[46:30.510 --> 46:32.510]  I've got a lot of friends who will bring me gifts.
[46:32.510 --> 46:37.510]  And I can tell sometimes, as soon as I open it, it's got just that woody terp that I do not appreciate.
[46:37.510 --> 46:38.510]  Sorry, guys.
[46:38.510 --> 46:39.510]  I don't love it.
[46:39.510 --> 46:40.510]  But yeah, I think that's probably flour rosin.
[46:40.510 --> 46:43.510]  I would honestly say that is probably, well, not necessarily flour rosin like you just said.
[46:43.510 --> 46:44.510]  It was probably pressed.
[46:45.510 --> 46:47.510]  It could be bubble hash just pressed at a high temp.
[46:47.510 --> 46:50.510]  That's where I really get that burnt popcorn taste to me.
[46:50.510 --> 46:59.510]  And here's the other thing too is Ryan said that he'll only press the buds that don't have bag appeal.
[46:59.510 --> 47:03.510]  Well, the buds that don't have bag appeal also aren't the best buds.
[47:03.510 --> 47:06.510]  Your trim isn't the best material to run.
[47:06.510 --> 47:10.510]  Your best material to run is your smokeable- your bag appeal?
[47:10.510 --> 47:12.510]  That's your good hash.
[47:12.510 --> 47:13.510]  That's your good rosin.
[47:13.510 --> 47:14.510]  Gold in, gold out.
[47:14.510 --> 47:15.510]  Yeah, absolutely.
[47:15.510 --> 47:21.510]  So you might be getting trim run rosin, which is a polished dog turd.
[47:21.510 --> 47:26.510]  And that's not a negative thing.
[47:26.510 --> 47:29.510]  If you could polish a dog turd, fuck, you've done a great job.
[47:29.510 --> 47:31.510]  But it's a hell of a task.
[47:33.510 --> 47:36.510]  You could have done it correctly if you started off properly with the right goal in mind.
[47:36.510 --> 47:37.510]  Absolutely.
[47:37.510 --> 47:38.510]  All right.
[47:39.510 --> 47:40.510]  They don't expect gold from trash.
[47:40.510 --> 47:41.510]  Exactly.
[47:41.510 --> 47:43.510]  No, you can never expect that in the cannabis industry.
[47:43.510 --> 47:44.510]  Especially solventless.
[47:46.510 --> 47:48.510]  And I'm learning why this stuff is so pricey, you guys.
[47:48.510 --> 47:49.510]  You guys have explained it.
[47:49.510 --> 47:51.510]  Now I don't walk in and stare at it and go, why?
[47:51.510 --> 47:52.510]  Sure, sure.
[47:52.510 --> 47:54.510]  People can make funny things out of BHL.
[47:54.510 --> 47:59.510]  Yeah, I mean, all the pretty buds that you see, they don't get smoked, they don't get put in a bag.
[47:59.510 --> 48:03.510]  They're washed and thrown into my garden in the backyard.
[48:03.510 --> 48:07.510]  You know, like, yeah, the shit's- there's a lot of work that goes behind it.
[48:07.510 --> 48:11.510]  And the money, holy Christ, I bet I've got $15,000 or $20,000 in my cold room.
[48:11.510 --> 48:13.510]  Like, it's just- it's crazy.
[48:13.510 --> 48:15.510]  You know, so I mean, it's tough, man.
[48:15.510 --> 48:16.510]  It's tough.
[48:16.510 --> 48:17.510]  It's all about that dedication.
[48:17.510 --> 48:21.510]  A lot of people don't realize what somebody in your position, Ryan's position, my position,
[48:21.510 --> 48:25.510]  when you have a niche product like that, they don't understand the dedication to it,
[48:25.510 --> 48:28.510]  the commitment to just the equipment and the room and the space.
[48:28.510 --> 48:31.510]  And then there's the work after that, which we'll talk about in a minute here.
[48:31.510 --> 48:32.510]  Yeah, for sure.
[48:32.510 --> 48:34.510]  I wanted to keep on this.
[48:34.510 --> 48:35.510]  We got through temp.
[48:35.510 --> 48:36.510]  How about time?
[48:36.510 --> 48:37.510]  How long do we press this stuff?
[48:37.510 --> 48:40.510]  Once we've got it in the press, we bring down that weight.
[48:40.510 --> 48:43.510]  How long does it take for the goop and the gold to come out of there?
[48:43.510 --> 48:44.510]  Take it, Ryan.
[48:44.510 --> 48:48.510]  Well, for the goop and gold to actually start to come out, pretty much when you reach full pressure,
[48:48.510 --> 48:51.510]  I usually hit my timer button once I hit full pressure.
[48:51.510 --> 48:54.510]  For hash, a minute and a half to two minutes, generally.
[48:54.510 --> 48:55.510]  Oh, quickly.
[48:55.510 --> 48:57.510]  All right, that's fast.
[48:57.510 --> 49:00.510]  How much pressure should we put on there?
[49:00.510 --> 49:05.510]  I'm using a seven-ton press, but I don't have the actual pressure gauge where my bag is.
[49:06.510 --> 49:13.510]  So I will hit my timer when my bags hit the press, and I usually do a 30-minute warm-up.
[49:13.510 --> 49:15.510]  Or 30-minute, Jesus Christ.
[49:15.510 --> 49:16.510]  30-second warm-up.
[49:16.510 --> 49:17.510]  30-second.
[49:17.510 --> 49:25.510]  Again, so you've just put 20 grams of millions of little beach balls filled with oil into a bag, right?
[49:25.510 --> 49:31.510]  And now we're going to put that bag, and we're going to extract the oil that's in all these million little beach balls, right?
[49:32.510 --> 49:36.510]  But I don't want to extract the cuticles of the beach balls.
[49:36.510 --> 49:39.510]  I want them to melt and then to give me the oil, right?
[49:39.510 --> 49:40.510]  I don't want to.
[49:40.510 --> 49:44.510]  When I press out of the bag, I want oil to come out of the bag, not hash.
[49:44.510 --> 49:52.510]  So I allow it to melt for that 30 seconds, and I very slowly and very methodically, very systemically.
[49:52.510 --> 49:54.510]  That's not the word I want to use, but.
[49:54.510 --> 49:55.510]  Systematically.
[49:55.510 --> 49:56.510]  Systematically, thank you.
[49:56.510 --> 49:58.510]  Increase the pressure.
[49:58.510 --> 50:04.510]  And that's why, man, so I do give classes because this gets very detailed.
[50:04.510 --> 50:05.510]  Quickly tell us how we can find those.
[50:05.510 --> 50:06.510]  People want to know.
[50:06.510 --> 50:14.510]  Pedro's Grow Room at gmail.com or go to www.pedrosgrowroom.com and contact me there.
[50:14.510 --> 50:19.510]  I actually haven't been giving them in the last month, month and a half because I've been so stupid busy.
[50:19.510 --> 50:24.510]  But I just bought myself a laptop so that I can hopefully do classes and stuff on the road when I'm in the hotel at night.
[50:24.510 --> 50:25.510]  So trying to do that.
[50:25.510 --> 50:27.510]  So get a hold of me.
[50:27.510 --> 50:37.510]  There's a big difference between pressure at the gauge, pressure at the plates and pressure at the bag.
[50:37.510 --> 50:40.510]  So let's just use Ryan's here, for example, for a seven ton, right?
[50:40.510 --> 50:41.510]  Seventh ton.
[50:41.510 --> 50:47.510]  If you're pressing at full pressure, seven ton is 14,000 pounds.
[50:47.510 --> 50:48.510]  Right.
[50:48.510 --> 50:50.510]  And now 14,000 pounds.
[50:50.510 --> 50:58.510]  I think we all understand that if I come up to you and with an open palm in your chest and push, it's probably not going to do much.
[50:58.510 --> 51:00.510]  Right. It's going to push you back. Right.
[51:00.510 --> 51:08.510]  But if I walk up to you with a really sharp stick and stick it right in your chest and push with that same pressure, things are going to happen.
[51:08.510 --> 51:14.510]  Right. So there's a difference in pressure over a square over over your your your square, your square inches.
[51:14.510 --> 51:17.510]  So let's just go with that two by four and a half inch bag. Right.
[51:17.510 --> 51:23.510]  By the time I fold it over and everything is maybe two by four inches, eight square inches.
[51:23.510 --> 51:29.510]  OK, 14,000 pounds divided by eight.
[51:29.510 --> 51:31.510]  Is where we're at. Right.
[51:31.510 --> 51:34.510]  So where do you have about about 2000 pounds?
[51:34.510 --> 51:37.510]  And we'll go close enough, you know, roughly.
[51:37.510 --> 51:41.510]  That's about actually perfect at the bag. That's where right where you want to be.
[51:41.510 --> 51:43.510]  Literally right where you want to be.
[51:43.510 --> 51:53.510]  So at the end of your press, not straight into it, butter it down, let it when you see the press, I said, feel you really do go slow.
[51:53.510 --> 51:59.510]  You really do. Especially with hash. When you see the presses on my Ross and his legal fuckers, they're they're sped up in four times.
[51:59.510 --> 52:09.510]  So they're four times speed. But what that allows you to do, you can, aside from seeing me over there pumping it every time you see it.
[52:09.510 --> 52:13.510]  You just know I'm over there giving it more pressure. That's why more is coming out.
[52:13.510 --> 52:19.510]  You know, it makes more sense. I don't think I realized that it was sped up either.
[52:19.510 --> 52:21.510]  Yeah, they're all four times.
[52:21.510 --> 52:27.510]  Man, some of those presses, some of the latest ones that have been doing what I waterfall them on top of each other.
[52:27.510 --> 52:34.510]  Each press, you know, from into the plates to set up for my next press is four minutes.
[52:34.510 --> 52:41.510]  So if I've done if you see me doing 1015 presses on one piece of parchment, do the math.
[52:41.510 --> 52:45.510]  I've had that camera sitting there recording that entire time and putting that together.
[52:45.510 --> 52:53.510]  I've realized now that people are going to have to straight up ruin a few batches of presses, a few presses.
[52:53.510 --> 52:58.510]  How many how many do you think they're going to ruin before they actually get a few washes and a couple of washes?
[52:58.510 --> 53:02.510]  Okay, I didn't. Yeah, putting that into that stories on the washes.
[53:02.510 --> 53:07.510]  But isn't that how you get good at shit? That's how you guys got to be the people that are on the show, right?
[53:07.510 --> 53:08.510]  Is by fucking up a bunch of times.
[53:08.510 --> 53:10.510]  Oh, yeah, big time. Oh, definitely.
[53:10.510 --> 53:13.510]  I washed fresh frozen in my fricking bathroom one time.
[53:13.510 --> 53:18.510]  It was nightmare. Talk about wasting fucking product. Oh my God.
[53:18.510 --> 53:20.510]  Because by the end it was just a flower.
[53:20.510 --> 53:29.510]  It was horrible, horrible. Yeah, the variable there is how how soon did you stop the bleeding and call me for classes?
[53:30.510 --> 53:33.510]  Literally, because you will ruin some shit. It's just inevitable.
[53:33.510 --> 53:37.510]  Yeah, I expected that. Just like growing. Yeah, it's an art.
[53:37.510 --> 53:38.510]  You're not going to be good at it the first time.
[53:38.510 --> 53:41.510]  And if you are, then you're not going to be good at it the second and third time.
[53:41.510 --> 53:55.510]  And if you're not passionate, you know, if you're just in it for the dabs, wink, wink, then, you know, you're probably not going to want to put through the effort to sit in the fall or the cold room for eight hours and do the work that it's going to take to require to get the good razzin.
[53:56.510 --> 53:59.510]  A lot of home growers, really, let's let's face it, are really going to probably press flower.
[53:59.510 --> 54:01.510]  Yeah, probably. It's easy.
[54:01.510 --> 54:05.510]  You know, it's you can buy a press for four or five hundred bucks, a decent press, and they're going to make dabs.
[54:05.510 --> 54:10.510]  I will tell you to not don't expect to be blown away with by your flower razzin.
[54:11.510 --> 54:13.510]  Just expect to get high.
[54:14.510 --> 54:17.510]  For some people to be self-sufficient, to be able to go from there.
[54:17.510 --> 54:24.510]  I have I take great pride still at this point in the game to grow something from seed and harvest it and put it in the bong and take a rip.
[54:24.510 --> 54:26.510]  I still go. Yeah, I did that.
[54:26.510 --> 54:28.510]  You did that. It's my time of doing it.
[54:28.510 --> 54:30.510]  And I still feel like, yeah, I did that. Yep.
[54:30.510 --> 54:37.510]  Absolutely. There's got to be another feeling once you've taken that from that flower to that frozen product to that press product and then put it to the banger.
[54:37.510 --> 54:40.510]  That's got to be a whole other step of relief and pride right there.
[54:40.510 --> 54:46.510]  Absolutely. And the only reason that I say don't be that, you know, I don't want to stomp on people that are pressing flower.
[54:46.510 --> 54:51.510]  Go ahead and do it. I just don't want you to smoke flower razzin and be like, well, this is shit.
[54:51.510 --> 54:54.510]  And where Pedro's what the fuck were they after? Like, this is horrible.
[54:54.510 --> 54:59.510]  Just know that's a line batter. I just said, yeah, flower razzin is the bottom of it.
[54:59.510 --> 55:02.510]  Maybe not the bottom of the bucket, but it's towards the bottom of the bucket of razzin.
[55:03.510 --> 55:12.510]  And unfortunately, that's why for a couple of years I had a literally a bad taste for razzin in my mouth because I was being given probably flower razzin.
[55:12.510 --> 55:16.510]  That was probably too hot. And then you started coming around a little more. You live far from me.
[55:16.510 --> 55:20.510]  We're in Colorado, but we are hours and hours. It is like four and a half hours. It's crazy.
[55:20.510 --> 55:24.510]  Yes, we meet up in Denver and then you change my opinion. And then Green Dot Green Dot doesn't pay me.
[55:24.510 --> 55:29.510]  They don't even give me any discounts. Green Dot started putting out razzin that really blew my mind.
[55:29.510 --> 55:30.510]  And that's good razzin.
[55:30.510 --> 55:35.510]  Same color, same texture as yours. So I had to buy some and I approve. I'll buy more when they have it.
[55:35.510 --> 55:39.510]  But it always sells out. You razzin nerds buy. How do you know it's there already?
[55:39.510 --> 55:44.510]  The razzin nerds are like following around the delivery guy. They're like stopped.
[55:44.510 --> 55:50.510]  They pay attention. Just like I hope they pay attention when I make my razzin come to the market the first time.
[55:50.510 --> 55:51.510]  Yeah, they pay attention.
[55:51.510 --> 55:57.510]  I was just going to say, there is no good razzin here. That's why I make it. There's nothing here, man.
[55:57.510 --> 56:02.510]  It's rough up here. Our selection is very minimal. Like I said, we're a very new legal state.
[56:02.510 --> 56:09.510]  So our surrounding states, the quality is very rough. And if you find anything decent, you are paying very big money for it.
[56:09.510 --> 56:13.510]  I wasn't going to bring it up on purpose, but big shout out to New York for recently legalizing.
[56:13.510 --> 56:17.510]  I know you're up there in upstate New York. Big up for joining the team legalization.
[56:17.510 --> 56:18.510]  Sure. Absolutely.
[56:18.510 --> 56:24.510]  That can make your work a little bit easier. Going to get parts and supplies, definitely not as much of a sketch.
[56:24.510 --> 56:28.510]  Yeah, absolutely. Hopefully a career change someday, too.
[56:28.510 --> 56:32.510]  I'd love to see you run a facility doing Pedro's job pretty soon.
[56:32.510 --> 56:38.510]  Oh, it's crazy, man. I always have to remind myself that it's not even a dream come true.
[56:38.510 --> 56:44.510]  It's monumentally more than a dream come true. You almost can't put into words.
[56:45.510 --> 56:52.510]  This shit was illegal when I was growing up. And I'm now getting paid to extract, concentrate.
[56:52.510 --> 56:59.510]  It's mind boggling, dude. I never want to ever, I hope to God I never take it for granted.
[56:59.510 --> 57:00.510]  I hope to God I never take it for granted.
[57:00.510 --> 57:02.510]  Work's no longer work, man.
[57:02.510 --> 57:07.510]  I'm so dead and beyond exhausted, but I hope to God I never take it for granted.
[57:07.510 --> 57:10.510]  I'm right there with you, brother. So you remind me, I'll do my best to remind you.
[57:10.510 --> 57:12.510]  Beautiful. Will do. Will do.
[57:12.510 --> 57:14.510]  For sure. All right, guys, we've been going for close to an hour.
[57:14.510 --> 57:17.510]  I think we've covered most of the things I had written down.
[57:17.510 --> 57:20.510]  I do have one question. I think you guys can answer it quite quickly.
[57:20.510 --> 57:22.510]  I did ask for questions from the viewers.
[57:22.510 --> 57:26.510]  This person just said, what is with the foam that forms when making bubble hash?
[57:26.510 --> 57:28.510]  Why does it increase with each run?
[57:28.510 --> 57:32.510]  I find that I have to stop and change the water and material after 25 minutes.
[57:32.510 --> 57:37.510]  And then it says after my fourth run, he says I would sometimes I feel like a fifth run would be worth it.
[57:37.510 --> 57:39.510]  But with all the foam, I just say, fuck it.
[57:39.510 --> 57:43.510]  He does have a lot more to the question, but any idea why the foam, guys?
[57:43.510 --> 57:45.510]  Surfactants. Surfactants.
[57:45.510 --> 57:49.510]  Surfactants. Very potentially sprang and flower.
[57:49.510 --> 57:53.510]  Dust, dirt, dander, anything like that.
[57:53.510 --> 57:59.510]  Any oils can all be leading towards foaminess in the wash.
[57:59.510 --> 58:01.510]  Over agitation can be leading towards foaminess in the wash.
[58:01.510 --> 58:03.510]  That sounds like. That's what I was going to say.
[58:03.510 --> 58:05.510]  Beating the crap out of it.
[58:05.510 --> 58:08.510]  Sounds very possible when he's talking about fourth and fifth washes.
[58:08.510 --> 58:13.510]  I would immediately start firing questions back to him, asking how long he's agitating, what he's agitating in,
[58:13.510 --> 58:18.510]  how much volume he's putting in his if he's using mechanical washers and only filling up halfway.
[58:18.510 --> 58:20.510]  It's a way over agitation.
[58:20.510 --> 58:23.510]  Like there's a lot of missing variables here.
[58:23.510 --> 58:27.510]  But in the most instance, it's either over agitation or surfactants.
[58:27.510 --> 58:31.510]  So. I'm sure that's one of you guys gave a lot of info on that.
[58:31.510 --> 58:32.510]  I'm sure he'll he'll find an answer to that.
[58:32.510 --> 58:36.510]  And dude, if we didn't answer your question properly, send me a follow up question.
[58:36.510 --> 58:38.510]  All I've got to do is text Pedro.
[58:38.510 --> 58:40.510]  Absolutely. These guys are great. They're on my team.
[58:40.510 --> 58:42.510]  They're really close. Good resources.
[58:42.510 --> 58:45.510]  All right, gentlemen, I think we've covered a pretty good podcast.
[58:45.510 --> 58:51.510]  Do you have any things that you would like to add here at the end that I didn't ask or that you just want to put out to the universe?
[58:51.510 --> 58:53.510]  Big cheesy grin from Pedro.
[58:53.510 --> 58:57.510]  Yeah, I mean, there's.
[58:57.510 --> 59:01.510]  I hope people people find some value in the concentrates.
[59:01.510 --> 59:07.510]  I hope people see the see the passion and understand the pricing a little more like you just said that you do.
[59:07.510 --> 59:10.510]  And it's worth the work. It really is. It's worth the work.
[59:10.510 --> 59:13.510]  And, you know, if you enjoy quality concentrate, it's worth the work.
[59:13.510 --> 59:21.510]  Yeah. And me with the headiness, if you will, the new the new term, the headiness to me, it all kind of goes hand in hand.
[59:21.510 --> 59:28.510]  Right. Like I want if I'm smoking out of what I consider one of the best glass pieces, I want the best concentrate to go through it.
[59:28.510 --> 59:32.510]  So I hope there's just an appreciation and an understanding.
[59:32.510 --> 59:39.510]  And I guess another thing is, is it is achievable. It is achievable by everyone.
[59:39.510 --> 59:44.510]  It's not something that's out of the realm and it's safe to make you guys. There's no there's no boom boom.
[59:44.510 --> 59:47.510]  That's the best part. Get out there and mess up a few batches. You guys don't be afraid.
[59:47.510 --> 59:51.510]  You've got to mess up a lot to get to the level that these concentrate makers are at.
[59:51.510 --> 59:54.510]  You've got to mess up a lot to get good at anything in life.
[59:54.510 --> 59:57.510]  And if you're not doing anything and you don't make a few mistakes, you're going to get a big ego.
[59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.510]  Then you're going to find a bigger problem. So make mistakes in the beginning.
[01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:07.510]  Get humbled, get corrected. And then most importantly, reach out to Pedro for concentrate for extract for concentrate making classes.
[01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:11.510]  For sure. For sure. All right, Ryan, any final moments, any final thoughts from Ryan?
[01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:16.510]  I'm going to give you a Jerry Springer moment here. Not too much.
[01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:19.510]  Like like I said, I mean, I guess cold, cold, cold.
[01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:24.510]  Don't don't over agitate. Really pay attention to what you're making and just enjoy it.
[01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:28.510]  Guys are doing at home. It's safe. That's I think the bottom line is enjoy it.
[01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:32.510]  And it's safe. That seems to be the most important part that came from both you guys. Enjoy it.
[01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:35.510]  Enjoy what we are doing. You guys, this isn't supposed to be a headache.
[01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:38.510]  The headaches that do come from it should be learning lessons. So enjoy it.
[01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:42.510]  All right, gentlemen, I want to thank you guys once again for hanging out on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
