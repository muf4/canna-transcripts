[00:17.340 --> 00:19.740]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.740 --> 00:22.860]  It's time for episode number 93 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.100 --> 00:26.260]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.100 --> 00:27.380]  That's right.
[00:27.380 --> 00:29.620]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a
[00:29.620 --> 00:32.980]  new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even
[00:32.980 --> 00:36.100]  someone who's curious about the current state of cannabis, this, my
[00:36.100 --> 00:37.740]  friends is the podcast for you.
[00:38.380 --> 00:38.860]  I'm your host.
[00:38.860 --> 00:40.020]  My friends call me Ross DeGeff.
[00:40.060 --> 00:41.100]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:41.380 --> 00:44.180]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the
[00:44.180 --> 00:46.860]  Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my show.
[00:47.180 --> 00:50.780]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:51.580 --> 00:52.740]  I hope everybody's having a great day.
[00:52.740 --> 00:54.420]  I'm coming to you on a Thursday evening.
[00:54.620 --> 00:56.100]  It is finally cooled down a little bit.
[00:56.100 --> 00:57.020]  It's almost nine o'clock.
[00:57.020 --> 00:59.380]  It's been hot as shit all day.
[00:59.820 --> 01:01.020]  It's been hard to cool down today.
[01:01.020 --> 01:02.700]  So I'm excited for a little bit of coolness.
[01:02.700 --> 01:04.860]  I hope you're getting a little bit of sweet weather so that
[01:04.860 --> 01:06.620]  your grow room is not going crazy.
[01:06.660 --> 01:08.540]  These hot temps have everybody struggling.
[01:08.700 --> 01:09.940]  It's almost over you guys.
[01:09.940 --> 01:10.900]  The fall is coming.
[01:11.220 --> 01:12.180]  It will cool down.
[01:12.500 --> 01:13.580]  I'm looking forward to it.
[01:14.020 --> 01:16.700]  So while we don't have any sponsors this week, you guys, but we do
[01:16.740 --> 01:19.780]  have some good news, let's just jump right into it.
[01:20.180 --> 01:23.940]  I hardly ever have like news that we want to celebrate on the podcast.
[01:23.940 --> 01:26.700]  And this is definitely some news worth celebrating.
[01:26.700 --> 01:28.740]  I just have to make my computer cooperate.
[01:28.740 --> 01:29.100]  Here we go.
[01:29.380 --> 01:31.180]  I'm getting to the news article that I want to read.
[01:31.540 --> 01:33.260]  Um, this is a great headline.
[01:33.260 --> 01:34.860]  This article comes from the Cannabis.
[01:34.980 --> 01:36.820]  It is written by Summer Ballantine.
[01:37.260 --> 01:40.780]  And the headline says, Jeff Mazinski sentenced to life for
[01:41.060 --> 01:43.100]  pot freed from Missouri prison.
[01:43.100 --> 01:43.420]  That's right.
[01:43.460 --> 01:47.460]  This dude spent 20 years in prison for cannabis and he
[01:47.460 --> 01:49.060]  has been released from prison.
[01:49.420 --> 01:51.940]  Uh, this picture of him shows him with a big ass smile.
[01:52.220 --> 01:53.980]  Uh, the dude looks happy to be out of prison.
[01:53.980 --> 01:54.580]  Who wouldn't be?
[01:54.900 --> 01:56.340]  So I've got a huge article here.
[01:56.340 --> 02:00.180]  Let's just get right into it and make this podcast get down to business.
[02:00.180 --> 02:00.460]  Here we go.
[02:00.460 --> 02:02.700]  I'm looking for the article because my computer is pissing me off.
[02:02.740 --> 02:03.100]  Here we go.
[02:03.220 --> 02:03.420]  All right.
[02:03.740 --> 02:07.300]  It says Jeff Mazinski sentenced to life for pot freed from Missouri prison.
[02:07.620 --> 02:09.580]  He says, I spent a third of my life in prison.
[02:09.620 --> 02:10.260]  It's a shame.
[02:10.580 --> 02:14.740]  Uh, now a 62 after serving 20 years of a life sentence without parole for non
[02:14.740 --> 02:19.180]  violent marijuana related convict convictions, the article says from
[02:19.180 --> 02:23.060]  Jefferson city, Missouri, a man sentenced to life in prison without parole on a
[02:23.060 --> 02:27.660]  marijuana related charge was, was freed Tuesday from Missouri prison after being
[02:27.660 --> 02:31.020]  behind bars for two decades, a period in which the nation's attitudes
[02:31.020 --> 02:33.380]  toward pot have steadily softened.
[02:33.980 --> 02:37.500]  Family, friends, supporters, and reporters flocked to meet Jeff Mazinski
[02:37.500 --> 02:41.020]  as he stepped out of the Jefferson city correctional center into a sunny morning,
[02:41.420 --> 02:45.140]  uh, wearing a pair of white tennis shoes and a shirt that read I'm Jeff and I'm
[02:45.140 --> 02:45.660]  free.
[02:45.940 --> 02:47.900]  I want a shirt that says I'm Jeff and I'm free.
[02:48.020 --> 02:49.980]  I mean, I'm Jeff and I'm free.
[02:50.380 --> 02:50.660]  Shit.
[02:51.020 --> 02:51.580]  We'll keep going.
[02:51.580 --> 02:56.340]  It says, I, uh, he says I spent a third of my life in prison said Mazinski now 62,
[02:56.580 --> 02:58.700]  who was greeted by his infant great granddaughter.
[02:58.940 --> 02:59.660]  It's a shame.
[03:00.500 --> 03:03.900]  Uh, after a breakfast of steak and eggs with family, Mazinski said he planned to
[03:03.900 --> 03:07.540]  spend his post prison life seeking a job and advocating for the legalization of
[03:07.540 --> 03:08.100]  marijuana.
[03:08.540 --> 03:12.180]  He criticized sentencing for some drug related crimes is unfair and described his
[03:12.180 --> 03:13.860]  time behind bars as hell.
[03:14.500 --> 03:18.860]  Uh, his release followed years of lobbying by relatives, lawmakers, and others who
[03:18.860 --> 03:22.660]  argue that the sentence was too stiff and that marijuana should not be forbidden.
[03:23.260 --> 03:25.540]  Mazinski was sentenced in 1996.
[03:25.580 --> 03:29.100]  The same year, California became the first state to legalize marijuana for medical
[03:29.100 --> 03:29.780]  purposes.
[03:30.260 --> 03:34.540]  Medical marijuana is now legal in 23 States and recreational marijuana has been
[03:34.540 --> 03:39.420]  legalized in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington state, and Washington DC.
[03:39.980 --> 03:42.660]  The reason he's getting out is because the public clearly has changed.
[03:42.660 --> 03:44.940]  It's changed its opinion about marijuana.
[03:44.940 --> 03:49.620]  And it's just one of many ways in which that has been reflected in recent years,
[03:49.620 --> 03:51.500]  said Mazinski's attorney, Dan Vietz.
[03:52.020 --> 03:56.060]  Such extreme cases should further feel changing perceptions of nonviolent drug
[03:56.060 --> 03:59.380]  crime, said Michelle Deitch, a senior lecturer at the Lyndon B.
[03:59.380 --> 04:02.780]  Johnson school of public affairs at the university of Austin at Texas.
[04:03.420 --> 04:04.260]  That's a long title.
[04:04.300 --> 04:04.660]  Geez.
[04:04.980 --> 04:06.220]  School John Lyndon B.
[04:06.220 --> 04:09.020]  Johnson school of public affairs at the university of Austin, Texas.
[04:09.020 --> 04:11.340]  I'm glad I don't have to say that shit in my title every day.
[04:11.340 --> 04:12.620]  I say, hi, I'm Rasta Jeff.
[04:12.980 --> 04:13.580]  So much easier.
[04:14.100 --> 04:16.980]  Uh, the article says these cases really become exhibit a and the need for
[04:16.980 --> 04:19.260]  sentencing reform said, uh, Deitch.
[04:19.300 --> 04:20.300]  I think that's how you said that.
[04:20.660 --> 04:23.340]  Uh, an attorney and expert in criminal justice policy.
[04:24.180 --> 04:28.580]  Just last year, the heavily Republican Missouri legislature passed a law to
[04:28.580 --> 04:31.860]  allow certain people with epilepsy epilepsy to seek treatment with the
[04:31.860 --> 04:36.140]  marijuana extracting, uh, extract containing little of the chemical that
[04:36.140 --> 04:39.340]  causes marijuana users to feel high and larger amounts of a chemical
[04:39.340 --> 04:41.660]  called canna, cannabidiol or CBD.
[04:42.100 --> 04:43.540]  The patients can include babies.
[04:43.540 --> 04:45.580]  Vietz said, uh, nobody saw that coming.
[04:45.580 --> 04:47.260]  He said, that's a pretty radical statement.
[04:47.620 --> 04:51.660]  Police said he conspired to sell six pounds of marijuana to a dealer connected
[04:51.660 --> 04:53.180]  with the Mexican drug cartels.
[04:53.500 --> 04:57.180]  At the time, the life with no parole sentences was allowed under a Missouri
[04:57.180 --> 04:58.660]  law for repeat drug offenders.
[04:59.140 --> 05:03.340]  Mazzansky already had two drug convention convictions, one for possession and one
[05:03.340 --> 05:08.460]  for sale of marijuana in 1984 and another for possessing possession in 1991.
[05:09.020 --> 05:12.540]  He was the only Missouri inmate serving such a sentence for a nonviolent
[05:12.540 --> 05:13.820]  marijuana related offense.
[05:13.820 --> 05:17.860]  When democratic governor Jane Nixon agreed in May to commute his sentence.
[05:18.340 --> 05:22.060]  The commutation allowed Mazzansky to argue for his freedom before a parole
[05:22.060 --> 05:24.260]  board, which granted his request in August.
[05:24.700 --> 05:28.620]  Nixon Nixon's actions are a reflection of political confidence in changing
[05:28.620 --> 05:33.220]  norms around marijuana use said Cecilia Klingel, a criminal justice policy
[05:33.220 --> 05:37.460]  expert at the university of Wisconsin law school, the governor cited Mazzansky
[05:37.460 --> 05:40.980]  his nonviolent record, noting that none of his offenses involved selling drugs
[05:40.980 --> 05:44.500]  to children, the law under which he was originally sentenced has since been
[05:44.500 --> 05:45.140]  changed.
[05:46.460 --> 05:50.340]  Other States are reevaluating punishment for drug possession crimes motivated
[05:51.220 --> 05:55.780]  uh, in large part by the high cost of imprisoning low level nonviolent offenders.
[05:56.260 --> 06:00.220]  You guys imagine how much it costs to keep this dude in prison for 20 years.
[06:00.220 --> 06:03.580]  We could have sent people to, it costs more money to send people to prison for
[06:03.580 --> 06:07.180]  years than it does to send somebody to college is what I recently read.
[06:07.500 --> 06:09.340]  Uh, we probably could have sent three or four.
[06:09.460 --> 06:12.500]  He was in there for 20 years, probably could have sent five or 10, uh, people
[06:12.500 --> 06:15.860]  to college for the cost that it costs to house him and nothing came of it.
[06:16.220 --> 06:20.900]  Uh, maybe, maybe in the longterm, he will affect people being released.
[06:20.900 --> 06:21.980]  Maybe he did some good.
[06:21.980 --> 06:22.940]  I think that's called a martyr.
[06:22.940 --> 06:23.580]  Is that what he was?
[06:23.860 --> 06:24.780]  Maybe he was a martyr.
[06:24.900 --> 06:28.260]  So maybe it was worth it for the movement, but not for him and not for, you know,
[06:28.540 --> 06:30.900]  but they could have fucking educated some people for this cost.
[06:31.340 --> 06:32.740]  I'm going to keep reading my article here.
[06:32.740 --> 06:35.780]  It says in Connecticut, a new law will make possession of small amounts of hard
[06:35.780 --> 06:39.380]  drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and crack cocaine, a misdemeanor for a first
[06:39.380 --> 06:43.100]  time offense, rather than allowing for the current maximum seven year prison sentence.
[06:43.580 --> 06:46.980]  Nebraska and Alabama expect to save hundreds of millions of dollars by using
[06:46.980 --> 06:50.220]  new laws to cut down on the number of offenders locked up for possessing
[06:50.220 --> 06:52.460]  small amounts of drugs in Missouri.
[06:52.460 --> 06:56.100]  Backers of two ballot initiatives to legalize pot have permission from the
[06:56.100 --> 07:00.060]  secretary of state to begin collecting signatures to put the issue before voters.
[07:00.060 --> 07:05.180]  In 2016, another petition proposes reducing sentences for nonviolent drug
[07:05.180 --> 07:08.140]  offenders who are serving time without opportunity for parole.
[07:08.700 --> 07:11.500]  Mazzansky said he will not smoke marijuana now that he's free.
[07:11.540 --> 07:12.820]  He's on parole after all.
[07:13.100 --> 07:15.980]  But if it ever becomes legal on the state and federal level,
[07:15.980 --> 07:18.220]  Mazzansky said, definitely.
[07:18.500 --> 07:19.700]  So big congratulations.
[07:19.700 --> 07:20.380]  Welcome home.
[07:20.780 --> 07:22.100]  I think he's going to help out the movement.
[07:22.100 --> 07:25.700]  If they're releasing one guy, why aren't they going to start releasing all of the
[07:25.700 --> 07:30.180]  people who are in jail, anybody that committed any nonviolent cannabis crime?
[07:30.540 --> 07:32.420]  I think they should all just start releasing them.
[07:32.580 --> 07:34.740]  Just go unlock the cage and let those dudes out.
[07:35.340 --> 07:37.860]  And I'm a joint and a hundred bucks and send them on their way.
[07:39.060 --> 07:39.560]  All right.
[07:39.820 --> 07:41.900]  That's a, my good news.
[07:42.100 --> 07:43.300]  That is my good news.
[07:43.620 --> 07:45.100]  I do have some other good news.
[07:45.500 --> 07:46.980]  Uh, this is article number two.
[07:46.980 --> 07:48.780]  This one comes from the cannabis also.
[07:49.300 --> 07:52.580]  I have to give you a little catch up story behind this.
[07:52.940 --> 07:56.700]  Um, recently, uh, let me see if they tell you in this.
[07:57.020 --> 07:57.260]  Okay.
[07:57.260 --> 08:00.740]  There was recently a bunch of marijuana products in Colorado that were taken off
[08:00.740 --> 08:06.620]  of the shelves because they were suspected of having been produced with cannabis that
[08:06.620 --> 08:13.380]  had been sprayed with pesticides that are banned from the marijuana production.
[08:13.700 --> 08:14.540]  Uh, laws.
[08:14.540 --> 08:17.660]  We have what's called the marijuana enforcement division, and they have made
[08:17.660 --> 08:22.860]  laws in conjunction with the department of agriculture to regulate the sprays
[08:22.860 --> 08:24.140]  that can be put on these plants.
[08:24.500 --> 08:29.980]  So recently, um, on the first, a bunch of these edibles and products were taken
[08:29.980 --> 08:34.140]  off of shelves because they were suspected to have been made with contaminated cannabis.
[08:34.740 --> 08:39.580]  Um, I had that article planned to read to you when I opened up my computer today
[08:39.580 --> 08:43.020]  and went reading for news and seeing what was going on, the cannabis has posted
[08:43.020 --> 08:49.460]  this article and it says update Denver pot products, past pesticide test hold lifted.
[08:49.780 --> 08:52.780]  So I'm going to say that one more time, just to make it clear, uh, Denver pot
[08:52.780 --> 08:55.980]  products past pesticide test and the hold has been lifted.
[08:57.260 --> 09:01.100]  The sub headline says marijuana products from mountain high suckers and MMJ
[09:01.100 --> 09:05.620]  America showed no trace of an unapproved pesticide listed among their ingredients.
[09:05.940 --> 09:09.260]  The company owners said they were using old labeling.
[09:09.620 --> 09:10.220]  So here we go.
[09:11.020 --> 09:13.660]  Now this article is by David McGoya from the Denver post.
[09:13.900 --> 09:16.220]  I found it on the cannabis and it goes like this.
[09:16.620 --> 09:19.860]  Denver health officials Wednesday lifted a day old order to hold hundreds of
[09:19.860 --> 09:24.020]  marijuana infused lozenges and raw marijuana from two businesses after lab
[09:24.020 --> 09:28.620]  tests showed no trace of unapproved pesticide listed among their ingredients.
[09:28.940 --> 09:32.220]  The owners of mountain high suckers and MMJ America each said they had been
[09:32.220 --> 09:35.860]  using old labels that included among their ingredients, a pesticide that
[09:35.860 --> 09:38.060]  today is not approved for marijuana use.
[09:38.420 --> 09:42.580]  The pesticide spinosad had not been barred for use when the labels were made.
[09:42.580 --> 09:46.780]  The owner said, it looks like this was just an unfortunate labeling issue.
[09:46.940 --> 09:52.060]  Said Dan Roland, Denver spokesman for its office, uh, for its office of marijuana
[09:52.060 --> 09:53.500]  policy, sorry for my stumble there.
[09:53.820 --> 09:57.020]  A state law requires marijuana companies to list on their product labels.
[09:57.300 --> 10:01.340]  All pesticides, contaminants, and herbicides used in the production process.
[10:01.740 --> 10:05.100]  The city's enforcement action is the latest in a series of actions related
[10:05.100 --> 10:09.060]  to pesticides used on recreational and medical marijuana because the drug
[10:09.060 --> 10:10.820]  remains illegal under federal law.
[10:11.380 --> 10:14.300]  The U S environmental protection agency will not establish any
[10:14.300 --> 10:16.460]  allowable pesticide uses on marijuana.
[10:17.020 --> 10:21.180]  Technically no regulated pesticide can be legally used on marijuana, but state
[10:21.180 --> 10:25.380]  agriculture officials have said as long as it's used does not violate a pesticide
[10:25.420 --> 10:26.980]  label warnings and restrictions.
[10:26.980 --> 10:31.060]  It can be used on Monday, Denver warned businesses that products.
[10:31.540 --> 10:35.740]  Listing of unapproved pesticides should be removed from shelves and destroyed
[10:35.740 --> 10:37.300]  or returned to the manufacturer.
[10:37.940 --> 10:42.220]  Inspectors ordered tests on the product holds Tuesday after spotting spinosad
[10:42.220 --> 10:46.180]  listed among other ingredients of mountain highs, lozenges, and raw marijuana
[10:46.180 --> 10:48.380]  at MMJ America shop on Arapahoe street.
[10:49.780 --> 10:50.180]  Excuse me.
[10:50.420 --> 10:53.660]  The test did not detect spinosad city officials confirmed.
[10:54.220 --> 10:57.740]  Uh, mountain high had been using old labels from when it purchased marijuana
[10:57.740 --> 11:01.180]  trimming from a grower that had been using spinosad mountain high co-owner.
[11:01.180 --> 11:04.660]  Chad dribble said that was before the state said it could not.
[11:04.660 --> 11:06.780]  He said back then it wasn't a problem.
[11:06.780 --> 11:10.540]  Drivel said he just didn't look back on the labels.
[11:10.580 --> 11:11.460]  It was a mistake.
[11:11.460 --> 11:13.940]  It was on there, but the tests were clear undetected.
[11:13.940 --> 11:19.260]  We've never had a black Mark before now said, uh, now he said news of the city's
[11:19.260 --> 11:21.700]  action brought calls from as far as Las Vegas.
[11:22.140 --> 11:25.340]  Not only did we test negative for all pesticides, we were told by the city
[11:25.740 --> 11:28.100]  that just crossing off the name because we're already had the
[11:28.100 --> 11:29.420]  bags printed was acceptable.
[11:29.900 --> 11:31.540]  MMJ owner, Jake Salazar.
[11:31.580 --> 11:33.620]  Uh, that's what MMJ owner Jake Salazar said.
[11:34.020 --> 11:36.500]  Officials later told him he needs to reprint the labels.
[11:36.940 --> 11:40.260]  We ordered preprinted bags, 70,000 units.
[11:40.260 --> 11:43.780]  Every time last time we ordered them, this wasn't a banned substance.
[11:44.060 --> 11:47.940]  We now have to throw all of those bags away and reorder 70,000 more without
[11:47.940 --> 11:51.020]  that ingredient, which we clearly don't use Salazar said.
[11:51.540 --> 11:55.020]  The state's list of pesticides approved for use on marijuana has been in the
[11:55.020 --> 11:57.100]  drafting stage for about 18 months.
[11:57.460 --> 12:00.620]  The state will not say the pesticides are safe for use on marijuana.
[12:00.620 --> 12:03.580]  Only that their use does not violate label restrictions
[12:04.180 --> 12:05.460]  on how they should be used.
[12:06.540 --> 12:10.100]  Some pesticides are so non-toxic that the EPA does not require them to be
[12:10.100 --> 12:12.060]  registered nor restrict their use.
[12:12.340 --> 12:15.740]  Those can be used on marijuana, but the industry has complained that they
[12:15.740 --> 12:19.100]  aren't potent enough to eradicate the kinds of pests and mildews that can
[12:19.100 --> 12:21.980]  decimate a crop potentially worth millions of dollars.
[12:22.580 --> 12:28.260]  Uh, the city in the spring held more than 100,000 marijuana plants at 11 grow
[12:28.260 --> 12:32.740]  operations over concerns that unapproved pesticides had been used on them.
[12:33.060 --> 12:39.100]  So this article was from David Magoya and those products did not test for Spinosad.
[12:39.100 --> 12:40.260]  They were using old labels.
[12:40.900 --> 12:43.820]  Now this really sparks a little bit of question in my mind
[12:43.820 --> 12:46.060]  because I advocate Spinosad.
[12:46.100 --> 12:47.100]  I like Spinosad.
[12:47.100 --> 12:49.580]  I've used Spinosad recently.
[12:50.020 --> 12:53.620]  So this has me thinking I need to go in here and go to the department of
[12:53.620 --> 12:58.420]  agriculture website and figure out why or whichever website it is, it may be the MED.
[12:58.620 --> 13:02.340]  I need to go and figure out why I'm not allowed to use Spinosad because I run a
[13:02.340 --> 13:04.020]  shop, I run a grow at a shop.
[13:04.500 --> 13:07.460]  Uh, I need to find this list of pesticides.
[13:07.460 --> 13:09.700]  I'm not quite sure where I find this list of pesticides.
[13:09.700 --> 13:12.780]  I'm sure that the operations manager at the dispensary has it.
[13:12.940 --> 13:14.180]  So I asked him for that list.
[13:14.420 --> 13:15.260]  We're not at that point yet.
[13:15.260 --> 13:16.140]  So I don't need to know that.
[13:16.220 --> 13:20.460]  But I'm sure the marijuana enforcement division webpage has a list of
[13:20.500 --> 13:22.460]  approved or unapproved pesticides.
[13:22.460 --> 13:23.620]  All we got to do is go there and look.
[13:23.900 --> 13:25.900]  I really want to know why Spinosad has been banned.
[13:25.900 --> 13:28.460]  Cause I use that quite, quite often.
[13:28.820 --> 13:33.820]  Um, I will definitely figure out why, because something that will help prevent
[13:33.820 --> 13:40.940]  this, um, every dispensary will now be required to train all plant handlers
[13:41.460 --> 13:43.020]  in pesticide management.
[13:43.220 --> 13:47.500]  Everybody, every dispensary needs on staff, one person that can train every
[13:47.500 --> 13:49.860]  new employee on pesticide safety.
[13:50.220 --> 13:53.140]  And to be able to train them, you have to be certified by
[13:53.140 --> 13:54.820]  the department of agriculture.
[13:54.820 --> 13:56.780]  You have to take an applicator safety test.
[13:57.300 --> 14:00.340]  And, um, I have been required to do that since I am the lead
[14:00.340 --> 14:02.060]  grower at this spot dispensary.
[14:02.060 --> 14:05.340]  So I will be taking, I will be studying and taking that test.
[14:05.380 --> 14:08.500]  And then I will know a lot of stuff about pesticides and we will find
[14:08.500 --> 14:11.220]  out why Spinosad is unacceptable.
[14:11.660 --> 14:14.380]  Um, the department of agriculture representative actually told me the
[14:14.380 --> 14:18.860]  reason that Eagle 20 is not allowed in commercial grows drum roll, please.
[14:19.300 --> 14:22.180]  Because when it burns, it turns into cyanide.
[14:22.660 --> 14:25.380]  That's what the guy from the department of agriculture told me.
[14:25.660 --> 14:29.380]  It had nothing to do with the danger and toxicity of the chemical.
[14:29.620 --> 14:33.580]  It was actually because when it turns, if there's a fire, it turns into cyanide
[14:33.580 --> 14:35.540]  and the fire department doesn't want to deal with that.
[14:36.300 --> 14:37.780]  I found that rather interesting.
[14:38.580 --> 14:40.700]  All right, you guys, I have got one more news article.
[14:41.220 --> 14:43.900]  This one is from local news here.
[14:43.900 --> 14:46.580]  This one comes from the beautiful city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[14:47.020 --> 14:51.500]  I talked a little bit about Pueblo last time on the last episode, uh, talking
[14:51.500 --> 14:55.300]  about how Colorado and Pueblo in general was booming with cannabis and Pueblo,
[14:55.300 --> 14:58.980]  Colorado may become the, may already be the new Emerald triangle.
[14:59.300 --> 15:02.980]  So this article says funding college scholarships via pot grows
[15:03.020 --> 15:04.860]  proposed in Southern Colorado.
[15:05.860 --> 15:08.380]  So the headline says, gosh, excuse my throat.
[15:08.380 --> 15:10.180]  I'm going to take a drink before we even get into this.
[15:10.500 --> 15:12.780]  I'm going to take a drink and then I'm going to take a dab.
[15:19.840 --> 15:20.120]  All right.
[15:20.120 --> 15:20.680]  That was a good drink.
[15:20.680 --> 15:22.840]  Excuse the throat clearing on the podcast.
[15:22.840 --> 15:24.280]  I probably won't even edit that.
[15:24.280 --> 15:25.000]  So I'm sorry.
[15:25.840 --> 15:28.360]  So far, there's no editing to be done in this show and I like it.
[15:28.400 --> 15:29.360]  I'm getting a dab ready.
[15:29.680 --> 15:30.720]  You guys, I'm getting ready.
[15:30.720 --> 15:35.000]  Some amnesia Hayes from our friends at Colorado's best dabs.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.840]  I'm about to take a fat chunky dab.
[15:37.480 --> 15:38.240]  I'm getting it going.
[15:38.240 --> 15:40.280]  I hope you guys are going to take a dab with me on the podcast.
[15:40.280 --> 15:43.320]  If you're listening to the show, get a dab ready, get a bowl ready.
[15:43.720 --> 15:45.800]  If you're at work or something, sneak your vape pen out.
[15:46.400 --> 15:46.800]  Let's do it.
[15:46.800 --> 15:50.640]  You guys, let's get stoned together on the count of six, four, five, six.
[16:00.860 --> 16:01.900]  That's how we do it.
[16:03.060 --> 16:05.180]  We take dabs in the middle of the podcast.
[16:06.060 --> 16:07.860]  We used to smoke so much more hash on this show.
[16:08.180 --> 16:10.540]  I've been trying to get a little tighter and not be dad to fuck out.
[16:11.220 --> 16:12.700]  It also helps my throat last longer.
[16:13.980 --> 16:14.380]  All right.
[16:15.580 --> 16:16.820]  So, uh, yeah, that's amnesia.
[16:16.820 --> 16:19.620]  Hey, is from Colorado's best dabs and it makes my head fucking spin.
[16:19.660 --> 16:20.260]  It's so great.
[16:20.260 --> 16:21.100]  It gets me amped up.
[16:21.220 --> 16:22.140]  It makes me lively.
[16:23.220 --> 16:26.420]  Uh, hypothetically, if I were going to come home on my lunch break and smoke
[16:26.420 --> 16:29.460]  a bunch of dabs and need to go back to work, all energized and in the zone.
[16:29.700 --> 16:33.060]  Hypothetically, I would take four dabs of that and I'd be in the fucking
[16:33.060 --> 16:34.260]  zone when I went back to work.
[16:36.860 --> 16:37.140]  All right.
[16:37.300 --> 16:40.260]  Before I get onto this next news article, I am going to mention that I am
[16:40.260 --> 16:42.460]  recording this podcast live on Periscope.
[16:42.460 --> 16:43.860]  What up all my friends on Periscope.
[16:43.860 --> 16:44.700]  Thanks for watching.
[16:45.340 --> 16:49.660]  Uh, if you guys don't know what Periscope is, make sure you, uh, or don't make sure,
[16:49.660 --> 16:53.900]  but please I invite you to use your Android device or your iPhone device or
[16:53.900 --> 16:57.540]  your Apple device and download an app called Periscope and then look for me.
[16:57.540 --> 16:58.740]  I'm Rasta Jeff 420.
[16:58.820 --> 16:59.540]  Measy to find.
[17:00.340 --> 17:01.100]  Look for me on there.
[17:01.180 --> 17:01.780]  Follow me.
[17:02.180 --> 17:05.980]  And usually daily, I will do a dab on Periscope with my friends.
[17:06.260 --> 17:09.660]  You'll get a chance to ask me a question and I will rant for several minutes on
[17:09.660 --> 17:11.700]  your question if it gets my brain going.
[17:12.620 --> 17:13.660]  So check me out on Periscope.
[17:13.660 --> 17:16.820]  You guys, a big shout out to everybody that's watching on Periscope right now.
[17:17.180 --> 17:18.220]  Uh, what up Nemo punk?
[17:18.220 --> 17:19.180]  What up El Diablo?
[17:19.340 --> 17:22.020]  I can't see who else is on there unless they send a comment or something, but
[17:22.020 --> 17:23.060]  what up to everybody that's on there?
[17:23.060 --> 17:23.860]  Thanks for joining me.
[17:24.340 --> 17:27.100]  I hope you will join me on my next Periscope video.
[17:27.420 --> 17:30.060]  Sometimes I randomly decide that I want to put the podcast on
[17:30.060 --> 17:31.100]  Periscope while I'm doing it.
[17:31.340 --> 17:33.540]  And right now it's kind of cool because I feel like I'm talking to somebody.
[17:33.700 --> 17:36.140]  There's somebody, just someone to look at instead of just staring
[17:36.140 --> 17:36.980]  into the computer over here.
[17:37.420 --> 17:38.680]  I'm looking at my Periscope friends.
[17:38.680 --> 17:41.060]  I can't see them, but it feels like they're there.
[17:41.940 --> 17:42.260]  All right.
[17:42.260 --> 17:43.940]  I've got another news article up on the screen.
[17:43.940 --> 17:47.780]  I took a dab and got all fucking ADD and sidetracked, but shout out the dabs.
[17:48.740 --> 17:49.900]  Let's read this article.
[17:50.340 --> 17:51.340]  I read the headline, right?
[17:51.580 --> 17:54.380]  Uh, funding, color funding, college scholarships via pot
[17:54.380 --> 17:56.100]  grows proposed in Southern Colorado.
[17:56.540 --> 18:00.060]  Uh, the sub headline says Pueblo County commissioner Sal Pace says he hopes the
[18:00.060 --> 18:04.960]  measure that would institute a 5% excise tax on wholesale marijuana transfers
[18:04.960 --> 18:07.460]  will give Pueblo kids a boost.
[18:08.060 --> 18:09.700]  I am going to read this article.
[18:10.060 --> 18:15.980]  Um, I'm, I have mixed opinions on this right now, but it's by Jesse Paul.
[18:15.980 --> 18:16.920]  It's from the Denver post.
[18:16.920 --> 18:19.960]  I of course found it on our favorite news website, the cannabis.
[18:20.400 --> 18:21.960]  You guys, I don't bring you all of the news.
[18:21.960 --> 18:22.800]  I select a few.
[18:22.800 --> 18:24.980]  I pick and choose what I think is best for the audience.
[18:25.120 --> 18:29.120]  If you don't get enough news from me, I can definitely recommend the cannabis.
[18:29.480 --> 18:30.960]  Uh, high quality cannabis news.
[18:31.240 --> 18:34.200]  It's ran by a dude named Ricardo Baca, who is a really cool dude.
[18:34.220 --> 18:35.160]  I support that shit.
[18:35.160 --> 18:35.760]  Go check it out.
[18:35.760 --> 18:36.760]  If you don't get enough from me.
[18:37.800 --> 18:38.040]  All right.
[18:38.040 --> 18:39.200]  The article goes like this.
[18:39.980 --> 18:42.800]  If Pueblo County commissioner is proposing a ballot measure for a program
[18:42.800 --> 18:46.480]  to fund college scholarships through a marijuana excise tax commissioner,
[18:46.480 --> 18:49.740]  Sal Pace says he hopes the new measure will give Pueblo kids a
[18:49.740 --> 18:51.520]  boost and help fight college debt.
[18:51.960 --> 18:54.600]  The County commission is set to vote at their Monday meeting on whether or
[18:54.600 --> 18:57.760]  not the proposal will be placed on November ballot elections.
[18:58.240 --> 19:01.180]  The excise tax would be levied when marijuana is transferred
[19:01.180 --> 19:02.920]  from cultivation to a store.
[19:03.280 --> 19:05.280]  Pace's office said in a news release Wednesday.
[19:05.440 --> 19:05.920]  Oh yeah.
[19:05.960 --> 19:06.820]  He said that Wednesday.
[19:06.820 --> 19:07.040]  Sorry.
[19:07.040 --> 19:07.840]  I read that really weird.
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.200]  Pueblo County's perfect economic and weather conditions have created a boom
[19:13.320 --> 19:17.080]  of recreational cultivations without yet generating a tax on these grows.
[19:17.560 --> 19:21.840]  Beginning in 2017, graduating seniors from all high schools in Pueblo who
[19:21.840 --> 19:26.120]  attend a public college or university in Pueblo County will be eligible for
[19:26.120 --> 19:27.920]  scholarships from the proposed program.
[19:27.920 --> 19:31.920]  The release said every kid deserves an opportunity to succeed.
[19:32.280 --> 19:36.320]  Pace said in a statement, Pueblo County has potential new tax revenue from a
[19:36.320 --> 19:39.240]  marijuana industry that can benefit the kids of Pueblo.
[19:39.760 --> 19:43.200]  The ballot measure would propose a 5% excise tax on recreational
[19:43.200 --> 19:44.880]  marijuana grows from Pueblo County.
[19:45.280 --> 19:50.000]  It asks that on an annual basis, no less than 50% of tax revenue
[19:50.280 --> 19:52.160]  be designated for scholarships.
[19:52.960 --> 19:53.840]  50%.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  Well, if you're doing it for this, shouldn't a hundred, where's the other
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.680]  50 going, Sal, where's the other 50% going?
[20:00.080 --> 20:00.400]  Okay.
[20:00.640 --> 20:04.320]  Uh, the rest of the revenue would be used on community projects like Colorado
[20:04.440 --> 20:08.600]  state fairs, streetscape refurbishment, medical marijuana, academic research,
[20:08.600 --> 20:14.040]  and a feasibility study on the potential connection of Amtrak, uh, South Amtrak,
[20:14.040 --> 20:16.040]  Southwest chief to Pueblo.
[20:16.800 --> 20:19.040]  Now those all sound like feasible options.
[20:19.920 --> 20:21.480]  Those seem like they're worth some investment.
[20:21.840 --> 20:24.360]  The program may be expanded in future years, depending on
[20:24.360 --> 20:25.520]  revenue, the release said.
[20:25.800 --> 20:29.040]  Tyler Henson, president, president of the Colorado cannabis chamber of
[20:29.040 --> 20:32.560]  commerce said he hopes the, uh, the County commission will fully examine
[20:32.560 --> 20:36.520]  the measure before sending it to the ballot under amendment 64.
[20:36.520 --> 20:39.960]  We gave local governments the permission to make these excise taxes.
[20:39.960 --> 20:44.240]  He said, I would just caution the County commissioners to look at how this will
[20:44.240 --> 20:47.440]  affect sales in Pueblo and the surrounding areas.
[20:47.760 --> 20:48.960]  That's the first thing I think of.
[20:49.120 --> 20:50.880]  They're going to add 5% more tax.
[20:51.200 --> 20:53.400]  The tax is already really high in Pueblo.
[20:53.640 --> 20:55.560]  It's approximately 25%.
[20:55.840 --> 20:58.400]  I don't know the exact percentage to tell you the truth, guys.
[20:58.640 --> 21:02.200]  If anybody on Periscope, maybe a Nemo punk, if you want to throw up the
[21:02.200 --> 21:06.040]  actual percentage of tax, I'll say that on the air and I'll give you a shout out.
[21:06.360 --> 21:08.840]  Make sure you guys follow my friend Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[21:09.200 --> 21:13.400]  Uh, he posts a lot of great cannabis shit, 17 and a half percent.
[21:14.200 --> 21:16.960]  Plus a 10% excise tax that already exists.
[21:16.960 --> 21:18.280]  So that's 27%.
[21:18.360 --> 21:22.280]  Plus they're going to add another five, which will make it 32% excise tax.
[21:22.520 --> 21:26.000]  So this extra excise tax is just going to end up falling on the customer in
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.720]  the end, no matter how it works, which is going to make cannabis tax 32% here
[21:30.720 --> 21:36.480]  in Pueblo, which means, uh, it's going to be roughly $185 for a quarter of
[21:36.480 --> 21:40.040]  cannabis, which is ridiculous when you can go to the street and you can get
[21:40.040 --> 21:45.160]  probably, you can get an ounce for that price on the street, you can get an ounce
[21:45.160 --> 21:49.120]  for $200, you can get an ounce for $150 on the street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[21:49.120 --> 21:52.480]  So this is going to turn around and put everybody back at the black market.
[21:53.120 --> 21:53.960]  They're just going to ruin it.
[21:54.440 --> 21:57.320]  They're trying to squeeze too much blood out of one turnip.
[21:57.320 --> 22:00.080]  I think is what my grandma used to said, trying to squeeze blood out of a turnip.
[22:00.720 --> 22:03.040]  I think, I think that's what these guys are trying to do and they're going
[22:03.040 --> 22:05.080]  to crash the whole marijuana thing.
[22:05.200 --> 22:07.200]  All right, you guys, I think that's enough podcast for this week.
[22:07.200 --> 22:08.080]  I'm going to wrap this up.
[22:08.280 --> 22:09.560]  I'm going to go see fish this weekend.
[22:09.560 --> 22:12.560]  So when I come back on Monday, I will have a lot of cool shit to talk about.
