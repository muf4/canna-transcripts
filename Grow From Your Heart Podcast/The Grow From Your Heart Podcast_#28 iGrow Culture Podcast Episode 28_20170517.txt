[00:06.200 --> 00:08.320]  Now this is a little bit different.
[00:08.320 --> 00:09.560]  Let me show you how I do it.
[00:09.560 --> 00:10.560]  Hits from the nail.
[00:10.560 --> 00:14.040]  Hits from the nail.
[00:14.040 --> 00:19.480]  If you want a hit from the nail, yeah, hell yeah.
[00:19.480 --> 00:23.320]  I want another hit from the nail all day.
[00:23.320 --> 00:26.640]  Yeah, check it out.
[00:26.640 --> 00:29.280]  First you dip it, you dab it, then you fire it up.
[00:29.280 --> 00:30.600]  You may as well.
[00:30.600 --> 00:32.640]  And take that hit from the nail.
[00:32.640 --> 00:35.160]  Now put your bomb down just for a second.
[00:35.160 --> 00:37.520]  Don't get me wrong, it's not a new method.
[00:37.520 --> 00:41.040]  It's still inhale, exhale.
[00:41.040 --> 00:42.720]  I'll send you a nail in the mail.
[00:42.720 --> 00:44.480]  Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:44.480 --> 00:48.680]  Welcome to episode number 28 of the I Grow Culture podcast.
[00:48.680 --> 00:50.720]  They call me Rasta Jeff, and I'll be your captain
[00:50.720 --> 00:52.040]  for this adventure.
[00:52.040 --> 00:53.880]  In this episode, Spencer and Jesse came back,
[00:53.880 --> 00:55.340]  and they brought our friend Michael.
[00:55.340 --> 00:56.960]  And we have a talk about pheno hunting,
[00:56.960 --> 00:58.560]  but we got really dabbed out.
[00:58.560 --> 01:01.280]  So I apologize if we were too high to be useful.
[01:01.280 --> 01:02.960]  Hopefully we sparked some questions.
[01:02.960 --> 01:05.560]  So please send those questions to me via email, Twitter,
[01:05.560 --> 01:08.600]  or Facebook, and I'll answer them on an upcoming show.

[03:19.980 --> 03:21.380]  Thanks for listening, guys.
[03:22.440 --> 03:23.500]  All right, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[03:23.500 --> 03:24.340]  We are back.
[03:24.340 --> 03:26.060]  We are gathered today, it sounds like we're in court.
[03:26.580 --> 03:27.500]  I thought church.
[03:27.500 --> 03:29.060]  Man, church or something, we're gathered.
[03:29.060 --> 03:30.820]  Well, it is gonna be a sermon.
[03:30.820 --> 03:33.820]  I've got Jesse back, I've got Spence back on the mic,
[03:33.820 --> 03:34.660]  and we got a new guy.
[03:34.660 --> 03:36.260]  We got Michael on the microphone with us tonight.
[03:36.260 --> 03:37.100]  What's up, bro?
[03:37.100 --> 03:38.100]  Not much, how you doing?
[03:38.100 --> 03:39.820]  Do you have a Twitter name or something
[03:39.820 --> 03:41.280]  people can look for and find you on,
[03:41.280 --> 03:42.660]  or an Instagram so they can check you out
[03:42.660 --> 03:43.900]  while they're listening to the show?
[03:43.900 --> 03:47.100]  It's at Colorado Bearded Dabbers on Instagram.
[03:47.100 --> 03:50.340]  Colorado Bearded Dabbers in the house.
[03:50.340 --> 03:51.180]  CBD.
[03:51.180 --> 03:53.860]  CBD crew, what up, what up?
[03:53.860 --> 03:55.780]  Yeah, big shout out to the whole CBD crew.
[03:56.460 --> 03:58.500]  So we're gonna talk about phenotypes.
[03:58.500 --> 04:00.340]  Everybody here is a pretty experienced grower,
[04:00.340 --> 04:02.340]  so everyone will have a lot of input.
[04:02.340 --> 04:04.820]  I should explain what a phenotype is.
[04:04.820 --> 04:06.540]  The first thing, I'll take one step back.
[04:06.540 --> 04:08.340]  We will explain a genotype.
[04:09.560 --> 04:12.980]  The offspring of two parents will make genetics,
[04:12.980 --> 04:15.400]  and that genetic makeup is the genotype.
[04:15.400 --> 04:19.180]  Out of that genotype, there will be various phenotypes.
[04:19.180 --> 04:20.780]  The best way I can think of to compare it
[04:20.780 --> 04:23.780]  would be when your parents make kids,
[04:23.780 --> 04:25.460]  they don't all look the same.
[04:26.140 --> 04:26.980]  Your dad's probably tall,
[04:26.980 --> 04:28.260]  your mom's probably a little shorter.
[04:28.260 --> 04:29.380]  One of them's got blonde hair,
[04:29.380 --> 04:31.060]  one of them's got dark hair.
[04:31.060 --> 04:33.220]  When they make kids, sometimes they come out
[04:33.220 --> 04:34.100]  with kids with blonde hair,
[04:34.100 --> 04:35.700]  sometimes they come out with kids with dark hair,
[04:35.700 --> 04:36.900]  sometimes they come out blue-eyed,
[04:36.900 --> 04:39.200]  sometimes they come out brown-eyed.
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.380]  Plants are gonna do the same thing,
[04:40.380 --> 04:41.660]  and that's to be expected.
[04:42.900 --> 04:45.680]  There are ways to minimize those traits,
[04:45.680 --> 04:47.940]  or bring out traits that you're looking for,
[04:47.940 --> 04:50.000]  but for the most part, when you're making seeds
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.340]  in the beginning, the seeds that most of you guys
[04:52.340 --> 04:53.540]  are able to get your hands on,
[04:53.540 --> 04:55.500]  but a lot of the breeders are selling you,
[04:55.500 --> 04:59.220]  are going to be F1s, F2s, or F3s.
[04:59.220 --> 05:01.940]  There are very few breeders going further than F4.
[05:01.940 --> 05:03.860]  There's one guy I know that brags about F5,
[05:03.860 --> 05:05.900]  which is really cool, really respectable.
[05:07.260 --> 05:09.260]  You're gonna see a lot of variation.
[05:09.260 --> 05:11.500]  I just talked a lot, I feel there's a lot of echo.
[05:11.500 --> 05:14.220]  I feel like I talked a lot about variation in phenotypes
[05:14.220 --> 05:15.940]  and a lot of F1 and stuff.
[05:15.940 --> 05:20.000]  An F1, when you take two plants, a male and a female plant,
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.020]  those are now your P1s, when you breed them,
[05:23.540 --> 05:24.780]  the seeds that come out of that are F1,
[05:24.780 --> 05:26.660]  that's the F1 generation.
[05:26.660 --> 05:28.380]  You're gonna have a lot of variety there.
[05:28.380 --> 05:29.660]  Some stuff's gonna look like mom,
[05:29.660 --> 05:32.260]  some stuff's gonna look like the dad.
[05:32.260 --> 05:33.240]  You're gonna get a lot of switch,
[05:33.240 --> 05:35.180]  and then you're gonna get stuff way in the middle,
[05:35.180 --> 05:37.820]  between the mom and the dad, you'll get that perfect hybrid.
[05:37.820 --> 05:39.300]  And that's a lot of times the one
[05:39.300 --> 05:41.140]  that everybody's looking for.
[05:41.140 --> 05:42.700]  And then a little further, you'll make an F2.
[05:42.700 --> 05:44.940]  If you find a sweet male and a sweet female
[05:44.940 --> 05:47.520]  out of those F1s, and you breed those together,
[05:47.520 --> 05:48.860]  you're gonna make an F2.
[05:49.860 --> 05:52.100]  F2 is where you come up with something
[05:52.100 --> 05:54.860]  that we call transgressive segregation,
[05:54.860 --> 05:56.700]  which means, and Jesse smiled
[05:56.700 --> 05:58.660]  when I mentioned this pre-show,
[05:58.660 --> 06:03.660]  transgressive segregation is when your actual progeny,
[06:04.540 --> 06:07.540]  which is your offspring, outperforms the parents.
[06:07.540 --> 06:10.220]  So if you take two seeds, a male and a female,
[06:10.220 --> 06:12.320]  and you cross them, and that plant that comes out
[06:12.320 --> 06:14.100]  is way more badass than the parents,
[06:14.100 --> 06:17.140]  you have just experienced transgressive segregation.
[06:17.180 --> 06:20.060]  So the F2 level is where you really wanna buy the seeds
[06:20.060 --> 06:21.940]  if a breeder's selling those seeds.
[06:21.940 --> 06:23.700]  A lot of us don't really let you know
[06:23.700 --> 06:26.860]  what we're giving you, which F level, how far it is.
[06:26.860 --> 06:29.460]  That's kind of personal stuff, it's kind of breeding secrets.
[06:29.460 --> 06:32.020]  But those F2s are awesome, if you can get ahold of those,
[06:32.020 --> 06:34.020]  that's where a lot of cool shit happens.
[06:34.980 --> 06:37.580]  So we're gonna kind of back up a little bit.
[06:37.580 --> 06:39.300]  The variation.
[06:39.300 --> 06:41.860]  A lot of us at the table seem to love the variation.
[06:41.860 --> 06:43.220]  We do what is called a pheno hunt.
[06:43.220 --> 06:46.100]  We buy a pack of seeds, you grow that whole pack,
[06:46.100 --> 06:49.260]  it's usually 10 seeds, and you look for,
[06:49.260 --> 06:51.120]  if you're not gonna breed, you eliminate the females.
[06:51.120 --> 06:51.960]  So hopefully you've got.
[06:51.960 --> 06:52.780]  The males.
[06:52.780 --> 06:53.660]  Oh, the males, thank you.
[06:53.660 --> 06:54.860]  Thanks, I'm dabbed out by the way.
[06:54.860 --> 06:55.700]  Not always.
[06:55.700 --> 06:56.540]  Doing good.
[06:56.540 --> 06:59.020]  Yeah, but thanks for watching my back.
[06:59.020 --> 07:02.280]  So you gotta pull those males, and then you keep it going.
[07:03.420 --> 07:05.540]  Oh, sorry, I'm trying to catch my breath also.
[07:05.540 --> 07:07.940]  You got the seed pack, you keep the females going,
[07:07.940 --> 07:09.180]  you try to find the good ones.
[07:09.180 --> 07:11.640]  You look for the traits that those are putting off.
[07:11.640 --> 07:14.500]  Early on, you could tell structure, speed of growth.
[07:15.060 --> 07:16.980]  Vigor, leaf size.
[07:16.980 --> 07:19.100]  You could tell if you got a more indica
[07:19.100 --> 07:21.060]  or sativa leaning phenotype.
[07:21.060 --> 07:22.020]  Node spacing.
[07:22.020 --> 07:23.420]  Node spacing, there you go.
[07:23.420 --> 07:26.380]  A lot of people like to jerk the stem a little bit
[07:26.380 --> 07:28.300]  and smell that, and they think that that's gonna lead
[07:28.300 --> 07:31.620]  to a lot of what it's gonna really smell like in the end.
[07:31.620 --> 07:32.620]  Sometimes.
[07:32.620 --> 07:34.780]  Now, what do you look for?
[07:34.780 --> 07:36.100]  I like smell.
[07:36.100 --> 07:37.900]  Okay, so that's really important.
[07:37.900 --> 07:42.900]  Node spacing, growth pattern, early resin production.
[07:43.740 --> 07:45.740]  Early resin production, so you wanna see that resin
[07:45.740 --> 07:48.660]  about day 30, 25-ish, getting frosty.
[07:48.660 --> 07:50.500]  If things are going real well, for sure.
[07:50.500 --> 07:52.740]  Okay, how about yourself over there, new guy?
[07:55.100 --> 07:56.300]  You want it louder or quieter?
[07:56.300 --> 07:57.140]  Hold on.
[07:57.140 --> 07:58.100]  Oh, it's just this thing over here.
[07:58.100 --> 08:00.180]  We've talked about this headphone thing.
[08:00.180 --> 08:02.140]  I'm usually looking for, usually a shorter,
[08:02.140 --> 08:03.220]  stockier plant.
[08:03.220 --> 08:04.420]  Shorter, stocky plants.
[08:04.420 --> 08:05.780]  Yeah, but not necessarily.
[08:05.780 --> 08:07.600]  I usually like more indica plants.
[08:07.600 --> 08:08.980]  That's why I'm usually looking for a shorter,
[08:08.980 --> 08:09.820]  stockier plant.
[08:09.820 --> 08:11.820]  Okay, that makes good sense.
[08:12.100 --> 08:14.500]  I also don't like when they wave around too much,
[08:14.500 --> 08:16.380]  because usually when they start stacking,
[08:16.380 --> 08:17.900]  they're gonna need to be staked up.
[08:17.900 --> 08:18.740]  Eventually.
[08:18.740 --> 08:21.100]  Okay, so a plant that supports itself a little.
[08:21.100 --> 08:23.260]  All right, how about you, Spence?
[08:23.260 --> 08:26.940]  Well, when I grow seeds, you can usually figure out
[08:26.940 --> 08:29.500]  whether or not your plant's gonna be, well, depending.
[08:29.500 --> 08:32.340]  Sometimes I grow plants under a Scrognett,
[08:32.340 --> 08:34.980]  so the lankier plants you'll get will be better
[08:34.980 --> 08:36.500]  for a Scrognett, in my opinion,
[08:36.500 --> 08:38.900]  and then your shorter, stockier plants
[08:38.900 --> 08:41.340]  will be your just freestanding plants
[08:41.860 --> 08:44.060]  that you can stake down and don't have to give
[08:44.060 --> 08:45.420]  too much support besides that.
[08:45.420 --> 08:50.180]  But, you know, vigor, smells, and then I look for,
[08:50.180 --> 08:52.380]  like, especially if I know what it's coming from,
[08:52.380 --> 08:54.180]  you can look at, like, your leaf sets
[08:54.180 --> 08:56.620]  and see if they start matching parents
[08:56.620 --> 08:57.460]  and stuff like that.
[08:57.460 --> 08:59.340]  And you can know which parent you've kind of got.
[08:59.340 --> 09:01.340]  All right, you said something sort of interesting
[09:01.340 --> 09:02.820]  that leads me to another point.
[09:02.820 --> 09:04.740]  Doing the pheno hunt, running a pack of seeds,
[09:04.740 --> 09:07.020]  and looking for that pheno that you like,
[09:07.020 --> 09:08.260]  both of these guys grow different.
[09:08.260 --> 09:10.460]  Everybody in this room grows a different style.
[09:11.140 --> 09:12.340]  Spence does the Scrognett.
[09:12.340 --> 09:13.860]  I don't do any Scroggin'.
[09:13.860 --> 09:15.860]  I like to run a seven gallon pot.
[09:15.860 --> 09:18.300]  So those plants you guys are worried about waving around,
[09:18.300 --> 09:20.600]  I've got a tomato cage on those early on in life,
[09:20.600 --> 09:22.220]  so they're not gonna get any wave around.
[09:22.220 --> 09:23.380]  I appreciate her doing that.
[09:23.380 --> 09:24.860]  I want that stretchy phenotype.
[09:24.860 --> 09:27.020]  Not stretchy, but I mean, with some height to it.
[09:27.020 --> 09:28.420]  I like, hey, look, that's what,
[09:28.420 --> 09:29.660]  I just gotta talk into my damn mic.
[09:29.660 --> 09:30.780]  I'm gonna wake up to it.
[09:30.780 --> 09:32.620]  Mic, mic down my mouth.
[09:32.620 --> 09:34.180]  It sounds a lot better that way.
[09:34.180 --> 09:35.460]  I always tell everyone, get up on the mic.
[09:35.460 --> 09:37.220]  I'm the one over here nowhere near the microphone.
[09:37.220 --> 09:38.140]  Get punk with it.
[09:38.260 --> 09:39.340]  Oh.
[09:39.340 --> 09:41.620]  No, you don't want my teeth on that thing.
[09:41.620 --> 09:43.220]  I'm not that punk.
[09:43.220 --> 09:44.220]  Some days you are.
[09:45.260 --> 09:47.380]  I saw you after your wedding.
[09:47.380 --> 09:48.860]  Hey, Burn, thanks for taking good care of me
[09:48.860 --> 09:50.220]  at the Hydro shop the other day.
[09:50.220 --> 09:51.580]  Big shout out to Hydro Pueblo.
[09:51.580 --> 09:53.580]  Burn was working and she treated me well.
[09:53.580 --> 09:54.420]  It was awesome.
[09:54.420 --> 09:55.260]  Good work.
[09:55.260 --> 09:56.080]  Store looks great.
[09:56.080 --> 09:57.420]  Everything's nice and clean.
[09:57.420 --> 09:59.500]  There's one big empty spot now where I was shopping.
[09:59.500 --> 10:00.340]  Yes, there is.
[10:00.340 --> 10:01.180]  It'll be refilled.
[10:01.180 --> 10:02.020]  Oh, it already is.
[10:02.020 --> 10:03.540]  Nice, nice.
[10:03.540 --> 10:06.700]  All right, we were talking about phenotypes and variation.
[10:06.700 --> 10:09.220]  Some people get angry about variation.
[10:09.220 --> 10:10.820]  Oh, Smith said to talk about S1s.
[10:10.820 --> 10:11.740]  We skipped S1.
[10:11.740 --> 10:13.860]  S1 is when, I do a lot of S1s.
[10:13.860 --> 10:18.200]  That's a feminized seed, essentially, or usually.
[10:18.200 --> 10:19.660]  Like if I take my Grateful Dog,
[10:19.660 --> 10:21.740]  two Grateful Dog clones of the same plant,
[10:21.740 --> 10:26.100]  reverse one, throw that pollen on the other one in flower,
[10:26.100 --> 10:28.620]  those seeds are not a new, it's not a new breed.
[10:28.620 --> 10:29.580]  It's just an S1.
[10:29.580 --> 10:31.880]  I've selfed it and made seeds of that same thing.
[10:31.880 --> 10:33.420]  So that's an S1.
[10:33.420 --> 10:36.460]  I find that those, a lot of people hate on feminized seeds,
[10:37.220 --> 10:38.580]  but if an S1 is done properly,
[10:38.580 --> 10:39.920]  and I want to hear your guys' opinions,
[10:39.920 --> 10:42.060]  because you've been growing my seeds a little bit,
[10:42.060 --> 10:44.980]  do the S1s seem to mirror their parents a little bit more
[10:44.980 --> 10:47.100]  than the regular-
[10:47.100 --> 10:47.940]  Very much so.
[10:47.940 --> 10:48.780]  Definitely.
[10:48.780 --> 10:53.220]  I definitely think S1s, I had, I think it was,
[10:54.340 --> 10:55.180]  I can't remember what it was,
[10:55.180 --> 10:56.920]  but it came out so different,
[10:56.920 --> 11:00.220]  but so much like it's one of its original parents.
[11:00.220 --> 11:01.540]  Was it the Capleton?
[11:01.540 --> 11:02.780]  I think it might've been the Capleton.
[11:02.780 --> 11:04.700]  Because I gave you a bunch of Capleton seeds.
[11:04.700 --> 11:06.100]  I'm going to tell everybody that Spence is actually,
[11:06.740 --> 11:07.980]  who threw down that white widow female
[11:07.980 --> 11:09.300]  that I use in the Capleton cross.
[11:09.300 --> 11:10.140]  So shout out, bro.
[11:10.140 --> 11:10.960]  That's awesome.
[11:10.960 --> 11:11.800]  Thank you.
[11:11.800 --> 11:12.640]  You've contributed.
[11:12.640 --> 11:13.820]  So I gave him the first handful of seeds I made out of that
[11:13.820 --> 11:15.700]  to run for me, just to say thanks.
[11:15.700 --> 11:18.100]  But yeah, I saw that in the pictures.
[11:18.100 --> 11:19.620]  I could see the grateful dog,
[11:19.620 --> 11:21.460]  but then if you knew that it was that white widow mom,
[11:21.460 --> 11:22.660]  you could see her in there.
[11:22.660 --> 11:23.700]  I could definitely see it.
[11:23.700 --> 11:25.380]  I've got buddies running it now,
[11:25.380 --> 11:28.940]  and I can look at them from four or five weeks
[11:28.940 --> 11:29.940]  after they've been planted,
[11:29.940 --> 11:32.300]  and you can see in the structure,
[11:32.300 --> 11:33.540]  and then in the leaf sets,
[11:33.540 --> 11:35.380]  like what parent it's related to.
[11:35.900 --> 11:37.780]  Or not related to, but closest to.
[11:37.780 --> 11:38.620]  Leaning toward.
[11:38.620 --> 11:40.700]  You can almost tell them, keep that one, pull that one.
[11:40.700 --> 11:42.380]  I'm getting good with the shit I've bred.
[11:42.380 --> 11:43.860]  I'm getting really good with that.
[11:43.860 --> 11:45.100]  Shout out to Vigor Lover.
[11:45.100 --> 11:48.500]  Vigor Lover is growing shit out of some Capleton like a boss.
[11:48.500 --> 11:51.340]  He makes dank water hash and grows that strain like a pro.
[11:51.340 --> 11:52.180]  So good work, bro.
[11:52.180 --> 11:54.560]  Thanks for doing my seeds justice.
[11:55.940 --> 11:58.700]  What is your experience with the S2s?
[11:58.700 --> 12:03.220]  As compared to say, F2, if you don't mind answering.
[12:03.260 --> 12:06.580]  So the S1s come out, I would say 50% of them
[12:06.580 --> 12:09.500]  look like mommy, and then the other 50 are a little weird.
[12:09.500 --> 12:10.940]  I know that's odd to say for a breeder,
[12:10.940 --> 12:13.620]  but you get mutants and shit when you do that.
[12:13.620 --> 12:14.980]  You're putting, it's.
[12:14.980 --> 12:16.220]  It's not a natural.
[12:16.220 --> 12:17.740]  It's cousin fucking, essentially.
[12:17.740 --> 12:20.660]  It's not really, I know I'm not supposed to say that word
[12:20.660 --> 12:21.580]  on the podcast anymore,
[12:21.580 --> 12:23.060]  but there's no better way to put that.
[12:23.060 --> 12:24.260]  It's cousin fucking.
[12:25.300 --> 12:27.860]  S2s come out even more uniform.
[12:27.860 --> 12:30.940]  I'm gonna say maybe 70% more uniform.
[12:30.940 --> 12:31.980]  I'm not the mathematician,
[12:31.980 --> 12:33.180]  and I didn't keep good enough notes.
[12:34.020 --> 12:37.540]  They're even more uniform once you get into that.
[12:37.540 --> 12:39.660]  And I didn't realize I was doing something unique
[12:39.660 --> 12:40.500]  when I was doing it.
[12:40.500 --> 12:43.100]  I took the same Grateful Dog, the original female,
[12:43.100 --> 12:47.820]  and kept taking the clone and using that reversed female
[12:47.820 --> 12:50.180]  to make seeds again, and then making another generation,
[12:50.180 --> 12:51.640]  almost inbreeding it.
[12:51.640 --> 12:54.740]  And I've gotten it so far that those come out like clones.
[12:54.740 --> 12:55.820]  Those Grateful Dog seeds.
[12:55.820 --> 12:56.660]  Oh, okay, yeah.
[12:56.660 --> 12:59.860]  The S4 generation, I think, is kind of what it would be.
[12:59.860 --> 13:01.060]  I don't know a lot of people that have done it,
[13:01.060 --> 13:01.900]  so I don't know how to label it.
[13:01.900 --> 13:04.260]  But if you can test four, those have come out,
[13:04.260 --> 13:05.540]  they're like clones of each other,
[13:05.540 --> 13:07.520]  growing seeds from clone, which is kind of nice
[13:07.520 --> 13:09.860]  for a breeder to achieve in a feminized seed.
[13:09.860 --> 13:11.140]  Yeah, for sure.
[13:11.140 --> 13:12.400]  Those aren't out on the market yet, guys.
[13:12.400 --> 13:13.500]  That's not what you're getting yet.
[13:13.500 --> 13:15.060]  I haven't made enough of them to check,
[13:15.060 --> 13:17.260]  but yeah, you guys will get them eventually.
[13:18.140 --> 13:20.140]  I bet those will be very popular.
[13:20.140 --> 13:21.960]  Yeah, that's gonna be very cool.
[13:23.020 --> 13:24.540]  I don't know anybody that's gotten them that far.
[13:24.540 --> 13:26.860]  You always find weird shit in feminized seeds.
[13:26.860 --> 13:27.700]  That's why I asked,
[13:27.700 --> 13:30.700]  because I don't think I've ever grown an S2 that I know of.
[13:32.900 --> 13:35.620]  I've grown up to F3 or F4.
[13:38.060 --> 13:40.980]  How far have you made, if you don't mind me asking?
[13:40.980 --> 13:41.820]  BX3.
[13:41.820 --> 13:42.660]  A B, okay.
[13:42.660 --> 13:44.420]  Yeah, so I'm at the point,
[13:44.420 --> 13:48.940]  I don't know if I want to back-cross it one more time,
[13:50.020 --> 13:53.180]  because I'm pretty happy with what I got from it.
[13:54.020 --> 13:57.780]  Or if I want to start in-crossing it and start making,
[13:57.780 --> 14:01.300]  I guess it'd be a F1, F2 generation.
[14:01.300 --> 14:02.420]  Do you know how-
[14:02.420 --> 14:03.660]  And so on.
[14:03.660 --> 14:06.100]  What percentage of those seeds now are coming out
[14:06.100 --> 14:07.840]  to be what you have in mind?
[14:09.620 --> 14:11.540]  Well, there's two different phenotypes,
[14:11.540 --> 14:12.540]  and I really like them both.
[14:12.540 --> 14:15.180]  As long as you got two, you can identify them.
[14:15.180 --> 14:17.500]  There were some less desirable phenotypes,
[14:17.500 --> 14:20.540]  and I worked them out, I believe, on the BX2 generation
[14:20.540 --> 14:22.060]  when I made the threes.
[14:23.340 --> 14:26.780]  And the threes of just the one phenotype
[14:26.780 --> 14:28.100]  I call One Night Stand,
[14:28.100 --> 14:30.860]  and it's a hazy phenotype.
[14:30.860 --> 14:31.700]  That's a great name.
[14:31.700 --> 14:32.980]  I'm shaking my head going,
[14:32.980 --> 14:34.620]  why didn't I write that down one day?
[14:34.620 --> 14:36.900]  I'm like, damn, he just killed him.
[14:36.900 --> 14:37.740]  It's that one.
[14:37.740 --> 14:41.180]  And then the other one is just the Depot Dog,
[14:41.180 --> 14:44.820]  and it's real, it was a Kim Dog stabilization project.
[14:44.820 --> 14:47.620]  So it's a lot like Kim D,
[14:48.540 --> 14:50.780]  a little bit like Diesel, a little bit more.
[14:50.780 --> 14:55.100]  More unique than, or not unique, but different thing,
[14:55.100 --> 14:57.860]  slightly different than Kim D, but a lot like it.
[14:58.860 --> 15:01.500]  You guys, we're throwing around a lot of crazy terms here.
[15:01.500 --> 15:04.660]  Yeah, my bad, or our bad for kind of fucking y'all up.
[15:04.660 --> 15:06.340]  But no, they'll catch up.
[15:06.340 --> 15:07.580]  We inspire them to learn stuff.
[15:07.580 --> 15:09.540]  If you're lost, Google it if you want to,
[15:09.540 --> 15:11.860]  or just keep listening, and eventually we'll fill you in.
[15:11.860 --> 15:13.140]  It may not be this episode,
[15:13.140 --> 15:15.180]  but all the stuff that we're saying will sound like,
[15:15.180 --> 15:16.820]  you'll sound like us in just a few months
[15:16.820 --> 15:17.660]  if you keep listening.
[15:17.660 --> 15:18.500]  For sure, yeah.
[15:18.500 --> 15:22.460]  And to other people, and reading books, and experience.
[15:23.300 --> 15:24.900]  What's your favorite girl book?
[15:25.860 --> 15:29.380]  Uh, the Mel Frank.
[15:29.380 --> 15:31.260]  Okay, perfect, yes, that's the start,
[15:31.260 --> 15:32.380]  that's the roots of everything.
[15:32.380 --> 15:33.220]  Yeah, that was the first one I ever read.
[15:33.220 --> 15:34.780]  You have a reliable book you go to, Michael?
[15:34.780 --> 15:37.340]  My favorite one, I don't really go to it as much anymore,
[15:37.340 --> 15:38.900]  but was True Living Organics.
[15:38.900 --> 15:39.740]  Great book.
[15:39.740 --> 15:40.580]  Yeah.
[15:40.580 --> 15:41.400]  Great one.
[15:41.400 --> 15:44.900]  TLO is my pickup book if I need to go search something.
[15:44.900 --> 15:47.020]  If I'm not hitting the internet, I'm gonna go,
[15:47.020 --> 15:48.540]  that book's pretty reliable.
[15:48.540 --> 15:50.100]  Shout out to the Rev.
[15:50.100 --> 15:52.180]  If you guys need help building soil,
[15:52.180 --> 15:53.460]  yeah, it's a great book.
[15:54.020 --> 15:55.660]  Jesse and I talk a lot about soil building
[15:55.660 --> 15:57.380]  on our outdoor lessons.
[15:57.380 --> 16:00.100]  If we go too fast, if you want more specifics,
[16:00.100 --> 16:01.500]  that book will fill you in.
[16:01.500 --> 16:02.700]  It'll teach you a lot.
[16:02.700 --> 16:04.860]  For myself, I like the Ed Rosenthal
[16:04.860 --> 16:08.380]  Oakster Dam Course Guide because it's thorough.
[16:08.380 --> 16:11.540]  It's got bug explanations, it's got all kinds,
[16:11.540 --> 16:13.500]  if I have a problem, that's the first book I go to.
[16:13.500 --> 16:14.940]  If one of you guys is like, hey bro,
[16:14.940 --> 16:16.780]  and I don't know the answer, I go get that one
[16:16.780 --> 16:18.300]  and read it and act like I know.
[16:18.300 --> 16:19.820]  Is that available to the public?
[16:19.820 --> 16:21.220]  That is available to the public.
[16:21.220 --> 16:22.900]  I've never read that one, or even seen it.
[16:23.340 --> 16:24.980]  Between that one and Jorge's book,
[16:24.980 --> 16:26.540]  you can cover just about everything.
[16:26.540 --> 16:28.340]  Jorge's book's great too.
[16:28.340 --> 16:30.660]  I hate to say it's outdated, but it feels,
[16:30.660 --> 16:32.940]  it's like your dad wrote it, it's like that generation.
[16:32.940 --> 16:33.780]  For sure.
[16:33.780 --> 16:34.620]  It's a great book.
[16:34.620 --> 16:37.980]  So is the Mel, man, I don't feel like Mel Franks
[16:37.980 --> 16:39.140]  is the dude to write.
[16:39.140 --> 16:40.860]  It's Robert Connell Clark is who I think
[16:40.860 --> 16:42.780]  you're thinking of, Marijuana Botany?
[16:42.780 --> 16:44.500]  No, no, no, not that far back.
[16:44.500 --> 16:47.340]  No, this one was written early 80s.
[16:47.340 --> 16:51.140]  But the title is How to Grow, or in the first chapter,
[16:51.700 --> 16:54.740]  how to grow a million pounds of skunk weed or something.
[16:54.740 --> 16:55.580]  Wow.
[16:55.580 --> 16:59.460]  Yeah, but they're talking about pounds, UK pounds.
[16:59.460 --> 17:00.780]  So, yeah.
[17:00.780 --> 17:02.260]  So it's, all right.
[17:02.260 --> 17:04.780]  Mel Thomas, I keep wanting to say.
[17:04.780 --> 17:05.900]  I don't know.
[17:05.900 --> 17:07.340]  My Googler is out of reach right now,
[17:07.340 --> 17:09.300]  so we'll just keep the conversation rolling.
[17:09.300 --> 17:10.340]  For sure.
[17:10.340 --> 17:13.460]  My favorite at this point in my life is Google.
[17:13.460 --> 17:16.540]  So you gotta sort through a lot of bullshit,
[17:16.540 --> 17:19.340]  but you learn where the reliable sources are.
[17:19.340 --> 17:22.820]  And when you see one of their articles pop up,
[17:23.860 --> 17:25.380]  and most of the time, I think they're probably
[17:25.380 --> 17:27.420]  referencing all these great books.
[17:27.420 --> 17:28.260]  Hopefully.
[17:28.260 --> 17:29.100]  Yeah.
[17:29.100 --> 17:30.260]  And guys, if you read some stuff on Google,
[17:30.260 --> 17:31.980]  read three or four articles on Google.
[17:31.980 --> 17:32.820]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:32.820 --> 17:33.860]  Think about what you're gonna do.
[17:33.860 --> 17:36.620]  Go smoke a fat joint and call one of your grower friends,
[17:36.620 --> 17:39.300]  or Twitter somebody here on the show,
[17:39.300 --> 17:41.420]  and say, hey, I just got this high idea,
[17:41.420 --> 17:44.260]  and I wanna try this crazy shit to my plants.
[17:44.260 --> 17:45.300]  And one of us on the show,
[17:45.300 --> 17:47.060]  usually we're pretty friendly folk.
[17:47.100 --> 17:48.020]  If you catch us at the right time,
[17:48.020 --> 17:49.380]  we'll answer your emails.
[17:49.380 --> 17:50.580]  It takes me a minute, y'all.
[17:50.580 --> 17:52.780]  I get a lot of messages.
[17:52.780 --> 17:54.780]  I grow culture at hotmail.com.
[17:54.780 --> 17:56.340]  I grow culture on Twitter.
[17:56.340 --> 17:58.820]  I grow culture on Instagram, and of course on Facebook.
[17:58.820 --> 18:00.580]  Feel free to message me.
[18:00.580 --> 18:02.900]  You can go to the iReed Genetics Colorado website
[18:02.900 --> 18:05.900]  and go to the forum, create an account, log in there,
[18:05.900 --> 18:08.020]  and I make it a point to answer those questions
[18:08.020 --> 18:10.020]  there personally, because that is my forum.
[18:10.020 --> 18:10.900]  I feel responsible.
[18:10.900 --> 18:13.420]  So log in there, create an account.
[18:13.420 --> 18:15.180]  I'll answer all of your questions.
[18:15.220 --> 18:18.580]  And if not, my buddy Tony, or Cut Proof, or Goodro,
[18:18.580 --> 18:21.460]  or somebody in there will help you out really soon.
[18:21.460 --> 18:23.020]  That's a good way to learn a lot of shit.
[18:23.020 --> 18:26.700]  Be leery of information from a lot of forums,
[18:26.700 --> 18:28.780]  especially, I'm not gonna say any names,
[18:28.780 --> 18:30.820]  but there's two specific ones that are-
[18:30.820 --> 18:33.020]  I've been banned from two forums for talking shit
[18:33.020 --> 18:34.900]  about people saying the wrong shit on there,
[18:34.900 --> 18:36.060]  and I'm okay with that.
[18:36.060 --> 18:36.900]  You can ban me.
[18:36.900 --> 18:37.740]  Oh yeah, yeah, fuck those guys.
[18:37.740 --> 18:39.020]  Yeah, if you're gonna do stuff wrong,
[18:39.020 --> 18:41.100]  and I say, that's bullshit, and you ban me,
[18:41.100 --> 18:42.180]  you're supporting bullshit,
[18:42.180 --> 18:43.860]  so ban me, I don't wanna play anyway.
[18:43.900 --> 18:45.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[18:45.380 --> 18:48.220]  And we don't need to shout out any of those websites.
[18:48.220 --> 18:50.020]  I read geneticscolorado.com.
[18:50.020 --> 18:52.620]  There's one, I really wanna say its name,
[18:52.620 --> 18:53.460]  but I'm not going to.
[18:53.460 --> 18:55.540]  Does it look like this?
[18:55.540 --> 18:56.380]  The ban motion that I'm making?
[18:56.380 --> 18:57.220]  Yes.
[18:57.220 --> 18:58.180]  Yeah, I'm banned from that.
[18:58.180 --> 19:00.380]  I am banned the fuck from that website.
[19:01.300 --> 19:03.500]  It looks like you're twisting a joint.
[19:03.500 --> 19:04.340]  Yeah.
[19:05.500 --> 19:07.860]  So phenotypes, I should mention,
[19:07.860 --> 19:09.060]  I'm gonna turn the music down just a touch,
[19:09.060 --> 19:10.580]  I feel like I'm yelling.
[19:10.580 --> 19:13.100]  The phenotypes, just to make you guys a little familiar,
[19:13.100 --> 19:15.420]  Girl Scout cookies is a phenotype.
[19:15.420 --> 19:18.220]  There are two known phenotypes of Girl Scout cookies.
[19:18.220 --> 19:19.580]  Everybody in the room is shaking their head.
[19:19.580 --> 19:22.420]  We all know that forum cut that everybody has,
[19:22.420 --> 19:24.060]  and then there's the platinum cut
[19:24.900 --> 19:26.660]  that I guess not everybody has
[19:26.660 --> 19:28.580]  that they brag about having in Cali.
[19:28.580 --> 19:30.020]  Is there more?
[19:30.020 --> 19:31.660]  Yeah, I think there may be more.
[19:31.660 --> 19:32.860]  There are more, but those are the,
[19:32.860 --> 19:33.700]  yeah, and that's why.
[19:33.700 --> 19:34.540]  The thin mint cut.
[19:34.540 --> 19:35.740]  Oh, the thin mint cut, that's right.
[19:35.740 --> 19:36.580]  See?
[19:36.580 --> 19:38.300]  And then, the OGKB.
[19:38.300 --> 19:39.140]  Shut up.
[19:39.140 --> 19:39.980]  OGKB.
[19:39.980 --> 19:42.740]  Is that a hybrid, or is that the same?
[19:43.380 --> 19:44.820]  No, it's not a cross, it's just a pheno.
[19:44.820 --> 19:45.660]  Just a pheno of it?
[19:45.660 --> 19:46.500]  Okay.
[19:46.500 --> 19:47.940]  Yeah, it's the funky, crazy looking one.
[19:47.940 --> 19:49.500]  If you've ever seen pictures of somebody saying
[19:49.500 --> 19:50.700]  Girl Scout, OGKB.
[19:50.700 --> 19:54.420]  Actually, isn't platinum cookies, isn't that a hybrid?
[19:54.420 --> 19:55.420]  I think that's a hybrid.
[19:55.420 --> 19:56.260]  Okay.
[19:56.260 --> 19:57.300]  Yeah, what about animal cookies?
[19:57.300 --> 19:58.140]  That's a hybrid.
[19:58.140 --> 19:58.980]  Hybrid, okay.
[19:58.980 --> 19:59.820]  Bean cookies and crayons.
[19:59.820 --> 20:00.660]  Yes, we'll see them.
[20:00.660 --> 20:02.780]  I brought you guys, because you knew some stuff today.
[20:03.860 --> 20:05.700]  Man, you got me thinking about some cookies now.
[20:05.700 --> 20:07.100]  I got a little bit of Girl Scout cookies
[20:07.100 --> 20:08.660]  hidden away over there.
[20:08.660 --> 20:10.300]  Jillybean is something super popular.
[20:10.300 --> 20:11.980]  You always hear about that candy store pheno
[20:12.020 --> 20:13.700]  and the orange pheno.
[20:13.700 --> 20:16.620]  There's Chernobyl, the golden ticket pheno.
[20:16.620 --> 20:18.380]  When you grow my golden goat from seed,
[20:18.380 --> 20:20.180]  you're looking for that golden goat pheno
[20:20.180 --> 20:22.100]  that looks just like mommy.
[20:22.100 --> 20:25.140]  Plushberry, that's a great example.
[20:25.140 --> 20:26.860]  There's a black cherry chem phenotype,
[20:26.860 --> 20:29.700]  and then there's the space queen dominant phenotype.
[20:29.700 --> 20:32.980]  And that black cherry chem, or no, black cherry soda.
[20:32.980 --> 20:33.820]  Sorry, black cherry chem.
[20:33.820 --> 20:34.980]  Yeah, it's a cross.
[20:34.980 --> 20:38.420]  Black cherry soda, the phenotype that's dominant to that
[20:38.420 --> 20:39.540]  is very noticeable.
[20:39.540 --> 20:42.700]  You'll know if you've got it about 20 days into flower.
[20:42.700 --> 20:43.980]  You can tell.
[20:43.980 --> 20:46.740]  Turn off the grow lights and turn on the normal lights
[20:46.740 --> 20:48.500]  and look from the underside of the calyx,
[20:48.500 --> 20:50.900]  and you'll see the purple for sure.
[20:50.900 --> 20:51.740]  Yeah, I do get that.
[20:51.740 --> 20:54.620]  Flow's got a couple known phenotypes.
[20:54.620 --> 20:55.460]  Yeah.
[20:55.460 --> 20:56.980]  DJ Short's flow.
[20:56.980 --> 20:59.260]  DJ Short said that he put that flow out,
[20:59.260 --> 21:01.380]  that he released that clone that's in Colorado.
[21:01.380 --> 21:03.900]  He said he let that out to show everybody
[21:03.900 --> 21:05.740]  what was possible with those seeds,
[21:05.740 --> 21:07.620]  what the potential of flow was.
[21:07.620 --> 21:11.100]  So that cut that we all have supposedly came from DJ Short.
[21:11.100 --> 21:12.020]  Shout out DJ Short.
[21:12.020 --> 21:13.660]  I have learned a lot of stuff from DJ Short.
[21:13.660 --> 21:17.500]  Yeah, I like that he's doing the Free Weed Show a lot more.
[21:17.500 --> 21:18.580]  It's so great.
[21:18.580 --> 21:20.140]  The new episode's fucking awesome.
[21:20.140 --> 21:21.100]  Yeah, listen to that one, you guys.
[21:21.100 --> 21:22.860]  You'll hear a lot of the, I've learned a lot from
[21:22.860 --> 21:24.620]  just listening to DJ on that show.
[21:24.620 --> 21:26.540]  And it's great to hear that he's not Canadian.
[21:26.540 --> 21:28.300]  He's actually a guy that we all thought
[21:28.300 --> 21:29.740]  he was from Canada for so many years.
[21:29.740 --> 21:31.060]  It's a boot time.
[21:31.060 --> 21:32.260]  I'm not touching that one.
[21:32.260 --> 21:34.180]  I didn't make it for anybody.
[21:35.420 --> 21:36.260]  You got something to say, Spence?
[21:36.260 --> 21:37.260]  Do it.
[21:37.900 --> 21:40.340]  You're all leaned up on the mic like you're ready to go.
[21:40.340 --> 21:41.180]  Hand on the trigger.
[21:41.180 --> 21:42.020]  I'm just trying to read your question
[21:42.020 --> 21:43.740]  so I can think of some shit to say.
[21:45.140 --> 21:47.180]  Do you, when you grow out of a pack,
[21:47.180 --> 21:49.340]  this is why is variation happening and useful?
[21:49.340 --> 21:50.700]  We talked about kind of why it's happening
[21:50.700 --> 21:52.700]  because we're breeding a male and a female
[21:52.700 --> 21:54.540]  and they're making babies and we don't want
[21:54.540 --> 21:56.100]  all the babies to look the same in the world.
[21:56.100 --> 21:57.740]  That's how plants survive.
[21:57.740 --> 22:00.460]  So how do you find that variation to be useful?
[22:00.460 --> 22:02.820]  Do you want that stuff?
[22:02.820 --> 22:04.780]  Do you want the different phenos?
[22:04.780 --> 22:06.900]  I mean, different phenos gives you,
[22:06.900 --> 22:10.180]  you know, like we talked about on a previous episode,
[22:10.180 --> 22:12.980]  we talked about how many phenos you should keep
[22:12.980 --> 22:14.340]  in a seed pack.
[22:14.340 --> 22:16.900]  So, you know, that's where you would want to keep
[22:16.900 --> 22:17.740]  a couple of different ones,
[22:17.740 --> 22:20.900]  especially if it's a seed pack that is a hybrid
[22:20.900 --> 22:22.740]  or something like that where you can get
[22:22.740 --> 22:25.220]  multiple variations of your parents.
[22:26.540 --> 22:28.900]  So I enjoy the different variations.
[22:28.900 --> 22:30.260]  Like some plants grow faster,
[22:30.260 --> 22:33.020]  some plants have more side branching.
[22:33.980 --> 22:35.820]  Different things like that, yeah, side branching.
[22:35.820 --> 22:37.540]  You know, some plants grow straight up
[22:37.540 --> 22:40.820]  and some plants, actually the bottoms grow
[22:40.820 --> 22:43.460]  almost as good as the top does.
[22:43.460 --> 22:45.980]  So, you know, those are the type of plants
[22:45.980 --> 22:47.860]  certain people look for.
[22:47.860 --> 22:49.580]  We need stuff that clones well.
[22:49.580 --> 22:51.060]  And clones well.
[22:51.060 --> 22:54.340]  I'm talking like, well, I got my clone games coming back.
[22:54.340 --> 22:55.180]  I'm coming strong.
[22:56.140 --> 22:57.860]  I really think they did something to the water
[22:57.860 --> 22:58.820]  around here or something.
[22:58.820 --> 22:59.940]  Cause everybody's clones,
[22:59.940 --> 23:02.100]  everybody that I know in this circle of growers
[23:02.140 --> 23:04.740]  was like, I don't, my clones, bro, my clones, bro.
[23:04.740 --> 23:07.540]  I've lost trays of clones, small trays.
[23:07.540 --> 23:09.140]  My game's back on like Spence said,
[23:09.140 --> 23:11.340]  but for a minute there, there were some clone issues.
[23:11.340 --> 23:12.700]  We were all calling each other like,
[23:12.700 --> 23:14.220]  yo, you got some clones?
[23:15.860 --> 23:16.940]  We're all getting back on it.
[23:16.940 --> 23:18.460]  Yeah, what was going on?
[23:18.460 --> 23:20.060]  It had to be something in the water.
[23:20.060 --> 23:21.740]  Something in the water.
[23:21.740 --> 23:25.060]  So it seems like every year this happens about this time.
[23:25.060 --> 23:25.900]  It's good to know.
[23:25.900 --> 23:27.900]  And also if you guys are indoor growers in Colorado,
[23:27.900 --> 23:29.660]  be prepared to be fucked for a couple of months
[23:29.660 --> 23:31.340]  because nobody's going to want to buy your product
[23:31.420 --> 23:35.260]  because I have seen an outdoor crop in every other yard
[23:35.260 --> 23:37.380]  in Colorado the past few weeks.
[23:37.380 --> 23:38.220]  Yep.
[23:38.220 --> 23:39.220]  It's been sunny and everyone's out
[23:39.220 --> 23:40.540]  playing with their trees.
[23:41.820 --> 23:42.660]  Yeah, so good luck.
[23:42.660 --> 23:43.500]  You guys are hustling.
[23:43.500 --> 23:45.540]  The dispensaries are going to slow down a little.
[23:45.540 --> 23:46.380]  That's bullshit.
[23:46.380 --> 23:47.200]  Nevermind.
[23:47.200 --> 23:48.180]  I can't believe I even thought that would happen.
[23:48.180 --> 23:49.820]  Yeah, I saw a dispenser the other day
[23:49.820 --> 23:52.900]  with a really big outdoor grow looking pretty nice.
[23:52.900 --> 23:54.140]  So yeah.
[23:54.140 --> 23:54.980]  Yeah.
[23:54.980 --> 23:55.820]  I think I've seen some pictures of that
[23:55.820 --> 23:57.260]  and that thing looks pretty damn killer.
[23:57.260 --> 23:58.100]  Yeah.
[23:58.100 --> 23:58.940]  Yeah.
[23:58.940 --> 24:00.340]  That's a really neat greenhouse.
[24:00.340 --> 24:01.820]  A lot of really cool fluorescent lights.
[24:01.820 --> 24:03.620]  I said, I talked about that place on the show.
[24:03.620 --> 24:05.660]  If anybody's gone by and taken cool pictures
[24:05.660 --> 24:07.340]  of that greenhouse I talked about,
[24:07.340 --> 24:08.180]  tweet me some pictures.
[24:08.180 --> 24:09.000]  I'd love to see it.
[24:09.000 --> 24:09.880]  It was my idea.
[24:12.100 --> 24:13.780]  We went, we saw it the night of Jesse's wedding
[24:13.780 --> 24:14.620]  and it was awesome.
[24:14.620 --> 24:16.100]  It was really great.
[24:16.100 --> 24:18.540]  How often do you get to do a pheno hunt, bro?
[24:21.740 --> 24:23.460]  Not as often as I'd like to.
[24:23.460 --> 24:25.860]  I wish I could go from seed every single time
[24:25.860 --> 24:27.940]  but I have some other plants I have to maintain.
[24:27.940 --> 24:30.980]  And you know, best way to do that is clone
[24:30.980 --> 24:34.380]  and run clones and you know, make new mother plants.
[24:34.380 --> 24:35.220]  Yeah.
[24:35.220 --> 24:36.220]  Yeah, that too.
[24:36.220 --> 24:37.940]  Keeps reliable medicine for the patients
[24:37.940 --> 24:39.180]  and that's what we all need.
[24:39.180 --> 24:41.660]  I'm, this winter I'm planning on growing
[24:41.660 --> 24:43.680]  pretty much exclusively seed.
[24:43.680 --> 24:46.300]  So other than just mother maintenance.
[24:46.300 --> 24:47.140]  So.
[24:47.140 --> 24:48.380]  Have you ever ran a whole pack of seeds
[24:48.380 --> 24:50.620]  and not gotten anything worth keeping?
[24:50.620 --> 24:51.460]  Yes.
[24:51.460 --> 24:52.280]  Me too.
[24:52.280 --> 24:53.120]  You?
[24:53.120 --> 24:53.960]  Yes.
[24:53.960 --> 24:55.900]  You're running, your shop's got a nice amount
[24:55.900 --> 24:57.060]  of seeds going right now.
[24:57.060 --> 24:57.900]  Yeah.
[24:58.740 --> 24:59.740]  You've got high hopes for that.
[24:59.740 --> 25:01.500]  There's a lot of different ones going on in there too.
[25:01.500 --> 25:02.460]  So it's very exciting.
[25:02.460 --> 25:04.680]  If you don't find a couple of keepers of each one
[25:04.680 --> 25:06.820]  it's going to feel like a lot of work for nothing.
[25:06.820 --> 25:08.900]  Well already it's looking like there's a couple
[25:08.900 --> 25:10.540]  that are setting themselves apart from the others.
[25:10.540 --> 25:12.120]  So it's pretty promising.
[25:12.120 --> 25:14.740]  And how many, how many days in are those?
[25:14.740 --> 25:16.140]  They are.
[25:16.140 --> 25:16.980]  They're in veg still.
[25:16.980 --> 25:17.820]  So how long?
[25:17.820 --> 25:19.580]  I think they're on day 23 in veg.
[25:19.580 --> 25:21.100]  They look good in your pictures on Instagram.
[25:21.100 --> 25:21.940]  They look great.
[25:21.940 --> 25:22.780]  Check them out guys.
[25:22.780 --> 25:23.780]  He looks great on Instagram.
[25:23.780 --> 25:26.460]  He's got some stylish glass and some stylish plants.
[25:26.460 --> 25:28.100]  And he takes the biggest dabs.
[25:28.100 --> 25:29.660]  Wait, what?
[25:29.660 --> 25:30.500]  Yeah.
[25:30.500 --> 25:31.340]  Oh, a dab competition.
[25:31.340 --> 25:32.160]  Wait, what?
[25:32.160 --> 25:33.000]  No, no, no.
[25:33.000 --> 25:33.820]  That's a good idea.
[25:33.820 --> 25:34.660]  If we're talking about competition,
[25:34.660 --> 25:35.620]  I think it just might be a friendly,
[25:35.620 --> 25:36.580]  it's a personal challenge.
[25:36.580 --> 25:37.420]  Personal challenge.
[25:37.420 --> 25:39.300]  We were, I was talking on an episode,
[25:39.300 --> 25:40.820]  it might've been the last one,
[25:40.820 --> 25:43.300]  that I'm going to put the gigantic dab thing
[25:43.300 --> 25:45.740]  to a rest for myself because I'm getting old.
[25:45.740 --> 25:46.740]  I know how you feel.
[25:46.740 --> 25:47.580]  You know what I mean?
[25:47.580 --> 25:49.420]  That is rough.
[25:49.420 --> 25:51.340]  It takes a little bit of effort and it kind of,
[25:51.340 --> 25:53.820]  if you do it in the mid afternoon
[25:53.820 --> 25:54.700]  and you don't plan it right,
[25:54.700 --> 25:56.300]  you could ruin your whole day.
[25:57.140 --> 25:58.500]  There's only so many times you can do a gram dab
[25:58.500 --> 25:59.340]  and survive.
[25:59.340 --> 26:00.180]  You know, I said,
[26:00.180 --> 26:01.900]  I think what I actually said was that my lungs,
[26:01.900 --> 26:04.740]  I've realized my lungs have so many inhales and exhales.
[26:04.740 --> 26:06.220]  And I think taking a gram dab,
[26:06.220 --> 26:07.060]  it's just like,
[26:07.060 --> 26:09.500]  you're just using up cat lives when you do that.
[26:09.500 --> 26:11.320]  That was 32 breaths you could have had,
[26:11.320 --> 26:13.740]  but instead you smoked a gram of hash.
[26:13.740 --> 26:15.820]  That's kind of how I feel about it.
[26:15.820 --> 26:18.100]  Well, if you're going to waste 32 breasts.
[26:18.100 --> 26:19.060]  Breasts.
[26:19.060 --> 26:19.900]  Breasts.
[26:21.420 --> 26:23.620]  I don't waste any breasts.
[26:23.620 --> 26:24.700]  Especially that many.
[26:26.340 --> 26:27.180]  But I mean,
[26:27.180 --> 26:29.580]  which better way to do it than taking a hash.
[26:29.580 --> 26:32.380]  At least you weren't breathing in concrete dust or something.
[26:32.380 --> 26:33.380]  You know, I've done that before.
[26:33.380 --> 26:35.540]  Or asbestos or something like that.
[26:35.540 --> 26:37.580]  Yeah, I definitely prefer the dabs.
[26:37.580 --> 26:38.420]  Yeah.
[26:38.420 --> 26:39.240]  Yeah.
[26:40.900 --> 26:42.420]  Wow, that music got really loud for a second.
[26:42.420 --> 26:44.100]  That might've been my fault.
[26:44.100 --> 26:45.660]  Do you guys want to give a shout out to this hash
[26:45.660 --> 26:46.940]  that we're hitting here?
[26:46.940 --> 26:47.780]  It's tasty.
[26:47.780 --> 26:48.600]  It's insolvent-less.
[26:48.600 --> 26:50.020]  Yeah, some trichome heavy extracts.
[26:50.020 --> 26:50.860]  Yeah.
[26:50.860 --> 26:51.700]  It's good work guys.
[26:51.700 --> 26:52.540]  For sure.
[26:52.540 --> 26:53.580]  Hell yeah.
[26:53.580 --> 26:54.920]  Off the Halen Honey Hole even.
[26:54.920 --> 26:56.960]  Shout out to Spence for bringing the Halen Honey Hole.
[26:56.960 --> 26:57.800]  That was dope.
[26:57.800 --> 26:59.800]  Oh yeah, that was on point.
[26:59.800 --> 27:00.640]  All right.
[27:00.640 --> 27:02.080]  This conversation has gotten off track
[27:02.080 --> 27:02.920]  because I'm dabbed out.
[27:02.920 --> 27:04.400]  What else do we want to talk about about phenotypes,
[27:04.400 --> 27:05.240]  you guys?
[27:05.240 --> 27:06.060]  Okay, I got a question.
[27:06.060 --> 27:06.900]  I like it.
[27:06.900 --> 27:07.720]  Ooh, purple.
[27:07.720 --> 27:10.160]  What is,
[27:10.160 --> 27:11.800]  what are bag seeds considered?
[27:11.800 --> 27:14.920]  Like seeds you find in like-
[27:14.920 --> 27:16.480]  Mostly S1s, I would say.
[27:16.480 --> 27:18.160]  You would say they're not considered S1s too.
[27:18.160 --> 27:19.760]  Since you don't know the parent.
[27:19.760 --> 27:20.600]  Yeah.
[27:20.600 --> 27:21.420]  Yeah, it's probably just an S1.
[27:21.420 --> 27:22.260]  Well, what if,
[27:22.260 --> 27:23.960]  well, you know the parent if you get the seeds
[27:23.960 --> 27:25.080]  out of the-
[27:25.080 --> 27:26.280]  But you don't know what the male was sometimes.
[27:26.280 --> 27:27.120]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[27:27.120 --> 27:27.960]  Yeah.
[27:27.960 --> 27:28.780]  Like what if it's,
[27:28.780 --> 27:31.800]  have you ever heard of plants like,
[27:31.800 --> 27:32.880]  are slightly humming?
[27:32.880 --> 27:35.400]  Yeah, slightly humming and seeding the plant
[27:35.400 --> 27:38.320]  and then taking the seed from there and growing that.
[27:38.320 --> 27:39.600]  Well, what would that be?
[27:39.600 --> 27:40.440]  That's an S1.
[27:40.440 --> 27:42.000]  That's how Soma,
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.160]  sorry Soma, I'm spilling your beans.
[27:44.160 --> 27:46.080]  That's how Soma actually makes feminized seeds.
[27:46.080 --> 27:48.720]  He takes a female and flowers her for too long.
[27:48.720 --> 27:49.560]  Okay.
[27:49.560 --> 27:50.380]  And then after she goes,
[27:50.380 --> 27:51.320]  like if you got a nine week strain,
[27:51.320 --> 27:52.440]  he lets it go for 13.
[27:52.440 --> 27:53.440]  And about week 13,
[27:53.440 --> 27:54.960]  it'll start spitting out pollen.
[27:54.960 --> 27:55.800]  Okay.
[27:55.800 --> 27:56.620]  And then he gathers that
[27:56.620 --> 27:58.320]  and throws it on the next crop that he makes.
[27:58.320 --> 27:59.160]  Okay.
[27:59.160 --> 28:00.000]  So then he can-
[28:00.000 --> 28:00.820]  Have you, oh, sorry.
[28:00.820 --> 28:02.440]  Oh, then he says he can smoke those buds too.
[28:02.440 --> 28:03.280]  Yeah.
[28:03.280 --> 28:04.120]  Because he can cut down most of the plant
[28:04.120 --> 28:05.800]  and just leave enough of it to herm out
[28:05.800 --> 28:06.800]  and spit out pollen.
[28:06.800 --> 28:08.160]  Then he can smoke the rest.
[28:08.160 --> 28:09.240]  Even if you can't smoke it,
[28:09.240 --> 28:10.940]  you can definitely probably extract it.
[28:10.940 --> 28:11.780]  There you go.
[28:11.780 --> 28:12.600]  Yeah.
[28:12.600 --> 28:14.080]  Have you heard of his fire technique?
[28:14.080 --> 28:14.920]  Oh yeah.
[28:14.920 --> 28:16.560]  Heat stress to pick the plants out.
[28:16.560 --> 28:17.400]  Yeah.
[28:17.400 --> 28:18.600]  That's a little weird to me.
[28:18.600 --> 28:19.800]  Yeah, it makes sense.
[28:19.800 --> 28:20.720]  I mean,
[28:20.760 --> 28:22.480]  or I guess I understand the theory.
[28:22.480 --> 28:23.320]  I mean, I'm not-
[28:23.320 --> 28:24.760]  Where he's coming from with the forest fire.
[28:24.760 --> 28:26.840]  Oh, I meant his method's more organic than mine.
[28:26.840 --> 28:27.680]  Yeah.
[28:27.680 --> 28:30.120]  That's pretty hardcore to, yeah.
[28:30.120 --> 28:32.160]  You don't want to smoke the flowers
[28:32.160 --> 28:33.680]  of the plants that I have reversed.
[28:33.680 --> 28:34.920]  You don't want to smoke those.
[28:34.920 --> 28:36.040]  You can smoke his.
[28:36.040 --> 28:36.880]  For sure.
[28:36.880 --> 28:37.700]  Yeah, you don't want to smoke mine.
[28:37.700 --> 28:39.100]  I don't think I would.
[28:39.100 --> 28:40.000]  I wouldn't encourage it.
[28:40.000 --> 28:40.840]  Yeah.
[28:40.840 --> 28:41.680]  Yeah.
[28:41.680 --> 28:42.500]  They've been sprayed with chemicals
[28:42.500 --> 28:44.080]  that I don't trust smoking.
[28:44.080 --> 28:44.920]  Yeah.
[28:46.440 --> 28:47.760]  ChemDog was bag seed guys.
[28:47.760 --> 28:49.320]  So don't ever doubt bag seed.
[28:49.320 --> 28:50.600]  I mean, I've seen some great-
[28:51.440 --> 28:55.240]  I've had some crazy looking stuff from bag seeds
[28:55.240 --> 28:56.720]  and I'm never-
[28:56.720 --> 28:58.160]  And it could be an F2.
[28:58.160 --> 29:01.560]  You could experience transgressive segregation.
[29:01.560 --> 29:02.880]  It could outperform its parents.
[29:02.880 --> 29:03.720]  Just like that.
[29:03.720 --> 29:05.440]  It will because you don't know what the parents were.
[29:05.440 --> 29:07.240]  It's hard to be able to outperform them.
[29:07.240 --> 29:11.020]  Well, you know, the person who was managing the room
[29:11.020 --> 29:12.860]  could have a good idea what the parents were.
[29:12.860 --> 29:14.240]  Yeah, probably that's about-
[29:14.240 --> 29:16.200]  I mean, I've seen people on Instagram
[29:16.200 --> 29:19.940]  sell packs of S1s for a hundred bucks.
[29:21.400 --> 29:22.240]  Yeah.
[29:22.240 --> 29:24.720]  One of those forum sites I saw a pack of S1s
[29:24.720 --> 29:27.080]  go for like freaking eight grand one time.
[29:27.080 --> 29:27.920]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[29:27.920 --> 29:29.960]  Yeah, I've seen some old seeds go for ridiculous money.
[29:29.960 --> 29:31.880]  Some OG Rascal stuff in a forum.
[29:31.880 --> 29:32.720]  Yeah.
[29:32.720 --> 29:34.160]  Went for a really high price recently.
[29:34.160 --> 29:36.040]  His, when I went to Cali,
[29:36.040 --> 29:38.560]  I met up with another person through Instagram and stuff
[29:38.560 --> 29:42.840]  and they had the original fire OG cut from Rascal
[29:42.840 --> 29:45.800]  and they said it was 20 Gs is how much it cost.
[29:45.800 --> 29:47.200]  That's an expensive clone.
[29:47.200 --> 29:48.040]  Yes.
[29:48.040 --> 29:49.200]  That's an expensive clone.
[29:49.200 --> 29:50.040]  What are you dabbing over there, Buster?
[29:50.400 --> 29:51.240]  It's worth it though.
[29:51.240 --> 29:54.200]  I'm doing a little bit of a lemon cookies from JP Wellness.
[29:54.200 --> 29:55.040]  Nice.
[29:55.040 --> 29:55.880]  Full melt.
[29:55.880 --> 29:57.520]  Lemon cookies, full melt.
[29:57.520 --> 29:58.520]  Shout out to JP Wellness.
[29:58.520 --> 29:59.960]  I heard a lot of good things about that place.
[29:59.960 --> 30:01.560]  Oh, Spence, you're ringing.
[30:01.560 --> 30:02.880]  Just cancel it, it's cool.
[30:02.880 --> 30:04.360]  Yeah, if you're up in the Springs, check them out.
[30:04.360 --> 30:05.880]  They got pretty good extracts.
[30:06.800 --> 30:08.100]  I'm gonna try to cut that out of there.
[30:08.100 --> 30:10.200]  Sorry, that's a torch, you guys, if you're wondering.
[30:10.200 --> 30:11.400]  It's time for me to take a dab too.
[30:11.400 --> 30:13.260]  I'm gonna take a sip of something and take a dab.
[30:13.260 --> 30:15.000]  Anybody got anything snazzy to say?
[30:16.280 --> 30:17.880]  Cheers to good weed.
[30:17.880 --> 30:18.720]  Hell yeah.
[30:18.720 --> 30:19.560]  Yeah.
[30:20.080 --> 30:20.920]  Snazzy weed.
[30:20.920 --> 30:22.080]  You got anything longer to say?
[30:22.080 --> 30:22.920]  No.
[30:22.920 --> 30:24.520]  Yeah.
[30:24.520 --> 30:28.080]  Are you working on any breeding projects right now, Jesse?
[30:28.080 --> 30:28.920]  Yes.
[30:28.920 --> 30:31.520]  What do you got going on in your project?
[30:31.520 --> 30:33.560]  I am, like I was saying,
[30:33.560 --> 30:37.560]  I'm really happy with the BX3 of Depot Dog.
[30:37.560 --> 30:40.840]  So I think I'm gonna make a whole bunch of seed of it
[30:40.840 --> 30:43.680]  and maybe get it to the public.
[30:43.680 --> 30:46.000]  So we'll see.
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.360]  I know a way you can make that happen.
[30:47.360 --> 30:48.200]  Yeah.
[30:48.200 --> 30:49.020]  Yeah.
[30:49.260 --> 30:50.980]  Tell them what the cross is on the Depot Dog again
[30:50.980 --> 30:52.460]  so they can get them excited.
[30:52.460 --> 30:56.020]  It's a old school Amsterdam.
[30:56.900 --> 31:01.380]  I don't really have a whole lot of heritage on it,
[31:01.380 --> 31:04.940]  but it's a, I don't know the producer of it,
[31:04.940 --> 31:06.700]  but it was a skunk haze.
[31:06.700 --> 31:09.980]  I believe it was a freebie from an old Amsterdam seed pack,
[31:09.980 --> 31:13.620]  but had really, really early resin production.
[31:13.620 --> 31:16.020]  And it was a skunk haze.
[31:16.020 --> 31:19.380]  So the initial reason I used it in the cross
[31:19.380 --> 31:22.940]  was he was very different than Kim D
[31:22.940 --> 31:26.380]  and it was very easy to spot out the phenotypes
[31:26.380 --> 31:28.460]  that were leaning harder towards him.
[31:28.460 --> 31:31.100]  So I kind of used it as a tool
[31:31.100 --> 31:33.260]  to make the Kim line more pure.
[31:33.260 --> 31:35.220]  I'm so glad that Kim was discovered.
[31:35.220 --> 31:36.060]  Yes.
[31:36.060 --> 31:36.880]  Yes.
[31:36.880 --> 31:39.300]  That's my favorite strain, hands down.
[31:39.300 --> 31:41.820]  Like a legit Kim.
[31:41.820 --> 31:45.540]  I need a Kim four back pad, Kim D even.
[31:46.380 --> 31:48.740]  Anybody out there that's got a killer Kim
[31:48.740 --> 31:51.020]  or Kim four, Kim D for Jesse?
[31:51.020 --> 31:51.860]  We can trade.
[31:51.860 --> 31:52.680]  We can trade.
[31:52.680 --> 31:55.260]  If you're in Colorado and you're an adult, we can do this.
[31:55.260 --> 31:56.420]  Yep.
[31:56.420 --> 31:59.060]  Maybe we can find some seeds or something for you.
[31:59.060 --> 32:02.340]  I've got a pretty cool Girl Scout cookies cup.
[32:02.340 --> 32:03.780]  So yeah.
[32:03.780 --> 32:06.540]  A lot of people are thirsty for that cookie still.
[32:06.540 --> 32:07.700]  I've heard.
[32:07.700 --> 32:10.940]  I've got the Gorilla Glue four and I've got Platinum OG.
[32:10.940 --> 32:11.980]  So let's talk.
[32:13.180 --> 32:14.620]  Yeah.
[32:14.660 --> 32:16.140]  I wonder if ours is the same.
[32:16.140 --> 32:16.980]  We'll see.
[32:16.980 --> 32:17.800]  Our Gorilla Glues?
[32:17.800 --> 32:18.640]  Yeah.
[32:18.640 --> 32:19.480]  Yeah, we should trade cuts.
[32:19.480 --> 32:20.300]  All right, I'm curious.
[32:20.300 --> 32:21.940]  Because there's different phenotypes of that, isn't there?
[32:21.940 --> 32:25.060]  Yeah, there's a more sour, diesel-y one.
[32:25.060 --> 32:27.060]  And then there's one that has more
[32:27.060 --> 32:30.340]  of that chocolate tie that's in it.
[32:30.340 --> 32:31.180]  Wow.
[32:31.180 --> 32:32.000]  What is Girl Scout?
[32:32.000 --> 32:33.860]  Or Gorilla Glue?
[32:33.860 --> 32:34.700]  We've moved on.
[32:34.700 --> 32:35.520]  It's Gorilla.
[32:35.520 --> 32:36.360]  We should make Girl Glue.
[32:36.360 --> 32:37.180]  We should breed those bitches.
[32:37.180 --> 32:38.020]  There you go.
[32:38.020 --> 32:38.860]  It is.
[32:38.860 --> 32:40.140]  Scout Glue.
[32:40.140 --> 32:40.980]  Be prepared.
[32:41.820 --> 32:43.500]  Hold on, let me think about it.
[32:43.500 --> 32:44.340]  Spence knows.
[32:44.980 --> 32:47.500]  It's like a bug sour or something like that.
[32:47.500 --> 32:50.740]  Sour Dub, chocolate tie, and...
[32:51.660 --> 32:52.660]  Chocolate tie.
[32:52.660 --> 32:53.500]  Something else.
[32:53.500 --> 32:54.320]  That sounds tasty.
[32:54.320 --> 32:55.660]  Something else.
[32:55.660 --> 32:57.460]  And very lanky.
[32:57.460 --> 32:58.980]  Yeah, I can already tell in Veg
[32:58.980 --> 33:00.300]  that those bitches are lanky.
[33:00.300 --> 33:01.140]  Really?
[33:01.140 --> 33:04.100]  Yeah, those clones are taller than everybody else already.
[33:04.100 --> 33:07.340]  The ones I've seen, pretty easy to point out.
[33:07.340 --> 33:08.820]  They're real bushy and stuff.
[33:08.820 --> 33:09.660]  Yeah.
[33:09.660 --> 33:10.860]  Or, no, yeah, I guess bushy.
[33:10.860 --> 33:11.900]  Bushy lankiness.
[33:11.900 --> 33:13.180]  Yeah, there you go.
[33:13.180 --> 33:15.340]  They grow with more vigor than a lot of the other stuff
[33:15.340 --> 33:16.180]  in my room.
[33:16.180 --> 33:17.000]  Kind of like a rose plant.
[33:17.000 --> 33:17.840]  Yeah.
[33:17.840 --> 33:18.660]  Whoa.
[33:18.660 --> 33:19.500]  Sorry.
[33:19.500 --> 33:20.340]  Boom.
[33:20.340 --> 33:21.460]  Got a text coming in.
[33:21.460 --> 33:25.020]  Jesse's phone is not really advanced, is the word.
[33:25.020 --> 33:26.300]  It may be an antique.
[33:27.780 --> 33:31.140]  Two and a half years in the phone world, that's an antique.
[33:31.140 --> 33:33.540]  Yeah, it kind of makes a lot of weird noises.
[33:33.540 --> 33:36.260]  All right, so yeah, that was a good rant about Finos
[33:36.260 --> 33:37.860]  because that Gorilla Glue, what's the other number?
[33:37.860 --> 33:39.820]  There's four and what's the other one?
[33:39.820 --> 33:41.460]  Just four is all I've heard of.
[33:41.460 --> 33:43.220]  There's like a seven or a three or some shit
[33:43.220 --> 33:44.060]  that I've heard about.
[33:44.060 --> 33:44.880]  Yeah.
[33:44.880 --> 33:46.300]  We need cuts of that one so we can compare them,
[33:46.300 --> 33:47.140]  you guys, find us.
[33:47.140 --> 33:48.620]  Yeah, I really wanna try that.
[33:48.620 --> 33:49.500]  Yeah.
[33:49.500 --> 33:50.940]  I've got a lot of great shit for trade.
[33:50.940 --> 33:55.100]  We'll be bringing Tangy to Southern Colorado soon, so.
[33:55.100 --> 33:56.700]  Not the Tang, because there's a strain
[33:56.700 --> 33:59.260]  that everyone calls the Tang that is not Tangy.
[33:59.260 --> 34:02.460]  Doesn't taste like any goddamn tangerines or anything.
[34:02.460 --> 34:03.500]  Zero oranges.
[34:03.500 --> 34:05.300]  Yeah, why'd you call that the Tang?
[34:05.300 --> 34:06.140]  What are you doing?
[34:06.140 --> 34:08.260]  I think it's Flo, goddammit.
[34:08.260 --> 34:10.060]  Pretty close.
[34:10.060 --> 34:12.360]  Yeah, I think it's Flo, quit trying to front.
[34:17.800 --> 34:19.300]  What are you growing now, bro?
[34:21.060 --> 34:24.220]  Platinum cookies, animal cookies,
[34:25.460 --> 34:28.780]  Gorilla Glue, moonshine haze, cookies and cream.
[34:28.780 --> 34:29.740]  Everyone's cookie crazy.
[34:29.740 --> 34:32.100]  Cookies and cream, that won the cup.
[34:32.100 --> 34:33.660]  Man, whoever took that name, Cookies and Cream,
[34:33.660 --> 34:34.500]  I wanted that.
[34:34.500 --> 34:35.320]  Yeah.
[34:35.320 --> 34:38.500]  Yeah, that was a, but it's,
[34:38.500 --> 34:40.540]  has anybody ever smoked Starfighter,
[34:40.540 --> 34:42.020]  or anything that was Starfighter?
[34:42.020 --> 34:43.060]  The Starfighter, I've too.
[34:43.060 --> 34:43.900]  Okay.
[34:43.900 --> 34:44.720]  It's a bomb.
[34:44.720 --> 34:46.340]  Okay, that's what I mean, I figured it is bomb,
[34:46.340 --> 34:47.660]  I just don't know.
[34:47.660 --> 34:48.860]  I've never smoked it, so.
[34:48.860 --> 34:51.620]  Starfighter, is that rare dankness, or is that?
[34:51.620 --> 34:52.660]  It's exotic genetics.
[34:52.660 --> 34:53.940]  It's exotic genetics, but.
[34:53.940 --> 34:54.820]  Oh, okay, okay.
[34:54.820 --> 34:55.660]  I remember you.
[34:55.660 --> 34:57.260]  Heh, heh, talking about that packet seed
[34:57.260 --> 34:58.660]  that's how I go for a lot of money.
[34:58.660 --> 34:59.500]  Yeah.
[34:59.500 --> 35:00.340]  Oh.
[35:00.340 --> 35:02.140]  Whoopsie.
[35:02.140 --> 35:06.900]  But that and then Enzo's Kush is what I've got going.
[35:06.900 --> 35:09.740]  And then I have a pheno hunt going right now, by the way.
[35:10.700 --> 35:13.100]  Which sucks, everybody, if you have timers,
[35:13.100 --> 35:14.420]  I have more than one program,
[35:14.420 --> 35:16.260]  make sure you go through your programs,
[35:16.260 --> 35:19.380]  and make sure there's no extra timers, chillin'.
[35:19.380 --> 35:22.820]  So, it's cool, you can catch it, but I caught it, thank God.
[35:22.820 --> 35:24.460]  You almost flower?
[35:24.460 --> 35:25.280]  Huh?
[35:25.280 --> 35:26.120]  Did you almost flower your plant?
[35:26.120 --> 35:26.960]  Oh, I was.
[35:26.960 --> 35:27.780]  Almost unflowered.
[35:27.780 --> 35:28.620]  Almost unflowered.
[35:28.620 --> 35:29.620]  Oh, almost unflowered, oh shit.
[35:29.620 --> 35:31.100]  So I had to like, well I was,
[35:31.100 --> 35:33.460]  my room, some plants look good, so I don't really know,
[35:33.460 --> 35:36.100]  like it's, I saw a wrong timer, but it was just weird,
[35:36.100 --> 35:38.700]  because there was no off timer, it was just on.
[35:38.700 --> 35:41.620]  But I've been in my room, and it's not on.
[35:41.620 --> 35:42.460]  Oh.
[35:42.460 --> 35:43.460]  Messing with those fancy digital timers.
[35:43.460 --> 35:44.460]  Yeah, I'm going.
[35:44.460 --> 35:46.660]  So when you reset your timer, guy, just reset it.
[35:46.660 --> 35:47.480]  The whole thing.
[35:47.480 --> 35:49.020]  Don't just, like yeah, just hit reset and clear it out.
[35:49.020 --> 35:51.340]  Don't just try to go and reset everything.
[35:51.340 --> 35:54.220]  Actually, hit the button, default that bitch.
[35:54.220 --> 35:56.120]  But I think they'll be fine, I've got a couple
[35:56.120 --> 35:57.540]  that are just growing right through it,
[35:57.540 --> 36:00.380]  and it didn't matter to it, so, kinda happy with those.
[36:01.340 --> 36:03.660]  What, uh, what light cycle are you running?
[36:03.660 --> 36:05.740]  You doing the 12-12 or the 11-13?
[36:06.380 --> 36:07.780]  12-12, I guess.
[36:07.780 --> 36:09.820]  That's actually a good way to stress test your plants.
[36:09.820 --> 36:11.940]  I was mentioning this, this is, since our phenotopic
[36:11.940 --> 36:13.980]  kinda got side-railed here, we ran out of shit
[36:13.980 --> 36:15.140]  to talk about, I think.
[36:16.660 --> 36:19.160]  I stress test my plants before I breed with them.
[36:19.160 --> 36:21.380]  I'll take a female, and put her in a room,
[36:21.380 --> 36:23.180]  I'll take a bunch of them, like I've got four or five
[36:23.180 --> 36:24.820]  new clones, I'll put them in the room,
[36:24.820 --> 36:26.860]  and I'll run it on 12-12 for two weeks,
[36:26.860 --> 36:30.100]  and then about day 15, I'll turn it off for 24 hours,
[36:30.100 --> 36:32.460]  day 15, I'll turn it on for 24 hours,
[36:32.460 --> 36:34.580]  and then I'll put it back on the opposite 12-12.
[36:34.580 --> 36:36.020]  So if I was coming on at 10 in the morning,
[36:36.020 --> 36:37.700]  now I'm coming on at 10 at night,
[36:37.700 --> 36:39.220]  and I'll run that for a few more days,
[36:39.220 --> 36:40.420]  you know, and just watch them grow,
[36:40.420 --> 36:42.340]  and they'll kinda freak out, and then I'll put it
[36:42.340 --> 36:44.540]  back into the normal flower cycle.
[36:44.540 --> 36:47.220]  And that really pisses off normal plants,
[36:47.220 --> 36:50.300]  and you will see a lot of things start to throw nanners
[36:50.300 --> 36:51.140]  and become a hermaphrodite right then.
[36:51.140 --> 36:52.700]  You'll see which ones really are true.
[36:52.700 --> 36:55.340]  And don't breed with them if they throw those bananas
[36:55.340 --> 36:57.220]  on you, because those are gonna be hermaphrodites
[36:57.220 --> 36:58.060]  in the future that'll cause you problems.
[36:58.060 --> 36:59.980]  Betrayed your passion.
[36:59.980 --> 37:02.980]  Same goes for males, but I don't wanna give away
[37:02.980 --> 37:04.700]  too many secrets, so we'll just leave it at that.
[37:04.700 --> 37:06.100]  Figure it out yourself.
[37:06.100 --> 37:09.180]  Yeah, male stuff is all, that's all proprietary stuff
[37:09.180 --> 37:10.540]  that you keep on the down low.
[37:10.540 --> 37:12.620]  Well, give them that at least.
[37:12.620 --> 37:15.780]  Don't want people breeding with a bunch of hermed-ass males.
[37:15.780 --> 37:17.340]  No, or the females.
[37:17.340 --> 37:18.460]  Yeah.
[37:18.460 --> 37:20.220]  You can usually spot a nice hermed male.
[37:20.220 --> 37:21.980]  The top clusters are too close together,
[37:21.980 --> 37:23.340]  and they look like they got fur between them.
[37:23.340 --> 37:26.180]  They start to look like a pussy willow or something,
[37:26.180 --> 37:27.860]  a foxtail sort of.
[37:27.860 --> 37:29.180]  Yeah, that's a nice hermed-out male.
[37:29.180 --> 37:30.380]  You can tell by that shit.
[37:30.380 --> 37:31.980]  You just want those big, juicy balls,
[37:31.980 --> 37:34.900]  and I will never say that ever, ever again.
[37:34.900 --> 37:39.900]  We'll talk about what kind of traits we look for in a male
[37:40.140 --> 37:41.900]  in another episode, Jesse will come in.
[37:41.900 --> 37:42.740]  No, we won't.
[37:42.740 --> 37:47.740]  No, we totally, I guess we'll, maybe.
[37:49.220 --> 37:51.340]  Eventually, like on episode 500,
[37:51.340 --> 37:53.020]  once everyone's listened for a long time and loves us.
[37:53.020 --> 37:53.900]  What are you doing over there, Spence?
[37:53.900 --> 37:54.860]  That looks dangerous.
[37:54.860 --> 37:56.020]  Just being a pyro.
[37:56.020 --> 37:57.860]  All right, that is fire and plastic.
[37:59.460 --> 38:00.540]  He just puts it down like,
[38:00.540 --> 38:02.940]  I already know how this shit ends.
[38:02.940 --> 38:05.420]  Ends with us outside, staring at the house going,
[38:05.420 --> 38:06.260]  that sucked.
[38:10.540 --> 38:12.380]  All right, so we've been going for,
[38:12.380 --> 38:14.500]  well, we've been at it for 35 minutes.
[38:14.500 --> 38:16.300]  You guys got anything you want to talk about on a podcast?
[38:16.300 --> 38:18.060]  Anything you've ever wanted to say?
[38:21.260 --> 38:22.100]  No.
[38:22.100 --> 38:23.380]  Everyone just kind of shakes their head and goes,
[38:23.380 --> 38:25.180]  nah, bro, we're good.
[38:25.180 --> 38:27.740]  I did have one side note back to the female hunting thing.
[38:27.740 --> 38:28.900]  That's good, because that's what everybody
[38:28.900 --> 38:29.940]  came to this show for.
[38:30.540 --> 38:33.300]  One big thing I look for is, I grow mostly indoors,
[38:33.300 --> 38:36.300]  so I like to have plants that respond well to topping
[38:36.300 --> 38:39.140]  and super cropping, so I can get a nice even canopy
[38:39.140 --> 38:41.260]  versus having a lot of lower growth.
[38:41.260 --> 38:44.420]  And certain strains really don't like topping.
[38:44.420 --> 38:45.740]  Oh, I remember.
[38:45.740 --> 38:48.540]  Purple, that's a phenotypic expression.
[38:48.540 --> 38:50.860]  That is a very phenotypical expression.
[38:50.860 --> 38:52.260]  So things like purpling.
[38:53.500 --> 38:57.420]  Even some strains, it's kind of a,
[38:57.420 --> 38:58.900]  because if you have an unhealthy plant,
[38:58.900 --> 39:00.940]  they'll have purple stems too.
[39:00.940 --> 39:03.620]  But I have seen healthy plants that just have purple stems.
[39:03.620 --> 39:05.700]  Girl Scout cookies purple up completely.
[39:05.700 --> 39:08.500]  You can't do nothing about it.
[39:08.500 --> 39:10.980]  Girl Scout cookies gets black and gets purple.
[39:10.980 --> 39:11.980]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[39:11.980 --> 39:15.300]  Yeah, it's a black leaf company or black leaf society.
[39:15.300 --> 39:17.540]  There it is, black leaf society.
[39:17.540 --> 39:19.860]  I might have had a couple dabs.
[39:19.860 --> 39:20.900]  That's a hashtag.
[39:20.900 --> 39:22.100]  That is a hashtag, check it out.
[39:22.100 --> 39:23.500]  It's good, it's a lot of cookie shots.
[39:23.500 --> 39:25.620]  You might find some of my cookies on there.
[39:25.620 --> 39:27.380]  Yeah, I think some of all of ours.
[39:29.340 --> 39:31.940]  No.
[39:31.940 --> 39:33.380]  Spence had something really great to say
[39:33.380 --> 39:35.380]  and then backed up from the microphone and backed out.
[39:35.380 --> 39:36.220]  Or not.
[39:36.220 --> 39:37.620]  Or not.
[39:37.620 --> 39:39.900]  It's all right, you don't have to say it.
[39:39.900 --> 39:40.740]  I don't know.
[39:40.740 --> 39:42.260]  Okay.
[39:42.260 --> 39:43.220]  The notes are done, bro.
[39:43.220 --> 39:44.500]  We set all the stuff on my notes.
[39:44.500 --> 39:46.380]  You're looking over here like, what can we say?
[39:46.380 --> 39:47.500]  Oh, I know.
[39:47.500 --> 39:48.860]  You had some, you're thinking?
[39:48.860 --> 39:50.780]  Like, and press pause while you think.
[39:51.980 --> 39:53.100]  Don't be as scared to kill your plants.
[39:53.100 --> 39:54.260]  Red hair buds.
[39:54.260 --> 39:55.100]  Oh, oh.
[39:55.100 --> 39:55.940]  Yeah.
[39:55.940 --> 39:56.780]  Did you guys hear that?
[39:56.780 --> 39:57.620]  Michael's taking a dab.
[39:57.620 --> 39:59.060]  He said, don't be afraid to kill off those plants
[39:59.060 --> 40:00.020]  that are not performing.
[40:00.860 --> 40:04.420]  When I do phenotypes, or both pheno hunts,
[40:04.420 --> 40:07.540]  I usually do probably like a couple seed packs,
[40:07.540 --> 40:09.140]  not just one.
[40:09.140 --> 40:11.140]  And it's kind of survival of the fittest for me
[40:11.140 --> 40:14.940]  because seeds, I like to not really like feed them too much.
[40:14.940 --> 40:17.220]  I kind of like to just let them see which ones
[40:17.220 --> 40:19.060]  are gonna do their thing until I have to start,
[40:19.060 --> 40:21.060]  you know, giving them food.
[40:21.060 --> 40:24.500]  So yeah, like I kill ones that if it's gonna get overgrown
[40:24.500 --> 40:27.540]  as a seed, it's probably gonna get overgrown as a plant.
[40:27.540 --> 40:28.460]  So I just get rid of it.
[40:28.460 --> 40:29.580]  Right.
[40:29.580 --> 40:31.020]  And there's nothing wrong with getting rid of it.
[40:31.020 --> 40:32.980]  It just makes your hunt smaller and more,
[40:32.980 --> 40:35.140]  now you can focus on other things
[40:35.140 --> 40:36.980]  instead of now you have one less plant.
[40:36.980 --> 40:38.860]  Yeah, it's like picking players for the team.
[40:38.860 --> 40:40.220]  You don't want those slow runners
[40:40.220 --> 40:41.260]  or the guy that can't shoot.
[40:41.260 --> 40:42.940]  You don't want me on your team.
[40:42.940 --> 40:44.060]  You want a lot of spits.
[40:44.060 --> 40:44.900]  I'll take you.
[40:44.900 --> 40:46.780]  You take me on your team, I can block, bro.
[40:46.780 --> 40:47.620]  That's what I'm saying.
[40:47.620 --> 40:48.460]  Just stay in there.
[40:48.460 --> 40:49.380]  I'm gonna stand right in front of the hoop.
[40:49.380 --> 40:50.220]  Just go, argh.
[40:50.220 --> 40:51.980]  Just both of us, just right in front of the hoop.
[40:51.980 --> 40:53.220]  Nobody's going to.
[40:53.220 --> 40:54.820]  We're both about six, five-ish, y'all.
[40:54.820 --> 40:56.820]  If you're wondering why we're talking about sports
[40:56.820 --> 40:58.140]  on a weed podcast.
[40:58.460 --> 40:59.300]  I don't know.
[40:59.300 --> 41:02.260]  Events you're doing, Secret Cup, see you there.
[41:02.260 --> 41:03.380]  I should be at the Secret Cup.
[41:03.380 --> 41:05.420]  I think I'm going with a low cab,
[41:05.420 --> 41:06.700]  so that should be a good time.
[41:06.700 --> 41:08.980]  When, I think that's September, uh-oh.
[41:08.980 --> 41:10.300]  27th, 28th.
[41:10.300 --> 41:11.580]  That's good, because I had something else
[41:11.580 --> 41:13.620]  going on in September.
[41:13.620 --> 41:15.380]  Since you're playing with that carb cap,
[41:15.380 --> 41:18.020]  we're going to give a huge shout out to the man, Task Rock.
[41:18.020 --> 41:20.100]  These blue carb caps,
[41:20.100 --> 41:22.340]  these new colored titanium pieces are dope.
[41:22.340 --> 41:24.340]  Y'all don't even know about this shit right here.
[41:24.340 --> 41:25.500]  Yeah, we got that new, new.
[41:25.500 --> 41:26.420]  This episode's coming out.
[41:26.420 --> 41:27.500]  We're pre-recording this one
[41:27.580 --> 41:28.620]  because I was out of town
[41:28.620 --> 41:29.860]  when we should have recorded this,
[41:29.860 --> 41:32.260]  so we're pre-recording.
[41:32.260 --> 41:34.860]  But this stuff is new, and they look good, bro.
[41:34.860 --> 41:36.740]  The color is not coming off.
[41:36.740 --> 41:38.980]  It looks just like the other carb caps.
[41:38.980 --> 41:39.820]  I like it.
[41:39.820 --> 41:40.660]  Good work, brother.
[41:40.660 --> 41:42.540]  Shout out, Task Rock and highly educated titanium.
[41:42.540 --> 41:43.700]  Yeah.
[41:43.700 --> 41:45.020]  Yeah.
[41:45.020 --> 41:48.020]  Is that a, it's not anodized, is it?
[41:48.020 --> 41:49.980]  I think that's the word, but I'm not certain.
[41:49.980 --> 41:50.820]  For sure.
[41:50.820 --> 41:52.260]  Take it with heat and change the color?
[41:52.260 --> 41:54.100]  Don't it turn like a rainbow color when you do that?
[41:54.100 --> 41:56.740]  There'd be a little more variation in it, I believe,
[41:56.780 --> 41:58.420]  if that was the process.
[41:58.420 --> 42:01.460]  I'll ask him, so that way we know, since.
[42:01.460 --> 42:02.700]  But yeah, if that's anodized,
[42:02.700 --> 42:05.740]  I mean, I have no doubt Task is, you know.
[42:05.740 --> 42:06.580]  Oh, Task is the man.
[42:06.580 --> 42:08.340]  Putting out top quality shit,
[42:08.340 --> 42:11.860]  so he's got a very high quality anodization process.
[42:11.860 --> 42:12.700]  In some spots.
[42:12.700 --> 42:13.620]  Anodizing process.
[42:13.620 --> 42:16.100]  The light needs to look purple from here.
[42:16.100 --> 42:16.940]  It could just be me, but it looks purple at this angle.
[42:16.940 --> 42:19.860]  I've seen so many people that look like Task lately.
[42:19.860 --> 42:20.700]  Yeah.
[42:20.700 --> 42:22.020]  I feel like people like dressing up like Task.
[42:22.020 --> 42:23.780]  Oh, yo, is that Task?
[42:23.780 --> 42:25.180]  But just jeans and a t-shirt, bro.
[42:25.220 --> 42:27.340]  That's not really an outfit or a costume.
[42:27.340 --> 42:29.700]  Oh, shit, here's a good size dab.
[42:29.700 --> 42:32.420]  Damn, that's a big old water hash dab.
[42:32.420 --> 42:33.620]  Yeah, I'll take that one.
[42:33.620 --> 42:35.020]  I'm gonna let Spence go ahead
[42:35.020 --> 42:36.180]  and heat up the honey hole for me,
[42:36.180 --> 42:37.580]  the Halen honey hole.
[42:39.820 --> 42:41.380]  Hey guys, thanks for bearing with a bunch of potheads.
[42:41.380 --> 42:42.860]  I know we tried to have a phenotype discussion.
[42:42.860 --> 42:44.580]  It feels like we covered a lot.
[42:44.580 --> 42:49.580]  Let's see if we can name off any other famous phenotypes
[42:49.980 --> 42:51.620]  or even some of your own.
[42:51.620 --> 42:53.860]  Heart of Gold, that's got a real.
[42:54.860 --> 42:56.460]  Michael's got something to say.
[42:56.460 --> 42:57.900]  It's a more of a question,
[42:57.900 --> 43:00.620]  but I'm growing out a grape somprogy,
[43:00.620 --> 43:03.700]  and does anyone know of any popular phenotype variations
[43:03.700 --> 43:04.580]  of that drink?
[43:04.580 --> 43:06.940]  There's one that actually tastes real grapey
[43:06.940 --> 43:11.540]  that Spence loves, a super grapey phenotype.
[43:11.540 --> 43:14.260]  And it almost looks, when the buds start to grow,
[43:14.260 --> 43:16.620]  they're real dense and they look furry.
[43:16.620 --> 43:19.980]  Like, yeah, that's the one that I really liked.
[43:19.980 --> 43:20.820]  A whole lot of hairs?
[43:20.820 --> 43:22.140]  A whole lot, not even.
[43:22.140 --> 43:23.540]  Or more tricone structure.
[43:24.220 --> 43:25.060]  Yeah, kind of tricone-y.
[43:25.060 --> 43:26.580]  It's got a real rigid structure.
[43:26.580 --> 43:28.620]  It just looks real crazy in the texture
[43:28.620 --> 43:29.900]  of the buds themselves.
[43:29.900 --> 43:30.980]  All right, guys, I won't be talking,
[43:30.980 --> 43:33.060]  so hopefully one of these guys covers the dead airspace
[43:33.060 --> 43:33.900]  while I take this dab,
[43:33.900 --> 43:36.580]  and then I'll correct the radio silence.
[43:36.580 --> 43:39.380]  All three of us just looked at each other like, oh shit.
[43:39.380 --> 43:42.220]  We wanted to talk a lot.
[43:42.220 --> 43:44.660]  Jeff totally leads the conversation for us.
[43:44.660 --> 43:47.820]  Have any of you guys ever had seeds that you grew
[43:47.820 --> 43:49.260]  and didn't take clones on,
[43:49.260 --> 43:51.820]  and it ended up being some really, really good shit,
[43:51.820 --> 43:52.660]  and you now.
[43:52.980 --> 43:54.460]  Yeah, it's the story of my life.
[43:54.460 --> 43:56.300]  I think all of us have experienced that.
[43:56.300 --> 43:57.140]  Yeah.
[43:57.140 --> 43:57.980]  Right on for the stab.
[43:57.980 --> 43:59.460]  There are many fish in the ocean,
[43:59.460 --> 44:04.460]  but yeah, I lost a alien dog, Vino,
[44:05.740 --> 44:07.100]  that was really bomb.
[44:07.100 --> 44:08.220]  Real sad about that.
[44:09.500 --> 44:10.900]  It was from a private breeder, though.
[44:10.900 --> 44:15.900]  It wasn't the alien dog that is from a very popular breeder.
[44:19.180 --> 44:21.540]  I recently lost my flow strain.
[44:23.180 --> 44:24.020]  That sucks.
[44:24.020 --> 44:24.860]  That was easy to get, though.
[44:24.860 --> 44:25.700]  Everybody in this room,
[44:25.700 --> 44:26.620]  I think everyone in this room has that.
[44:26.620 --> 44:27.460]  Oh, I know.
[44:27.460 --> 44:28.300]  I'm gonna get it back,
[44:28.300 --> 44:30.380]  but what am I gonna have to get up now?
[44:30.380 --> 44:31.460]  That was a good dab, thank you.
[44:31.460 --> 44:32.420]  Wow.
[44:32.420 --> 44:37.420]  I had, I grew DNA Genetics Holy Grail Kush from seed,
[44:38.020 --> 44:39.700]  and it was fire.
[44:39.700 --> 44:41.940]  If you guys are looking for a dank, stinky kush
[44:41.940 --> 44:44.100]  that's mostly indica that'll just set you down
[44:44.100 --> 44:47.160]  and taste like stinky, skunky feet,
[44:48.220 --> 44:49.060]  it's harder to grow.
[44:49.060 --> 44:51.060]  It's a bitch to grow, and it will not clone.
[44:51.780 --> 44:52.980]  I gave cuts to other people.
[44:52.980 --> 44:56.500]  They couldn't get it to clone, but that stuff was awesome.
[44:56.500 --> 44:59.300]  The DNA Genetics Holy Grail Kush, it just wouldn't.
[44:59.300 --> 45:01.060]  I don't even know if you can get that.
[45:01.060 --> 45:02.160]  I've got a pack of it.
[45:02.160 --> 45:05.540]  There's, he just released a whole bunch of them, I think.
[45:05.540 --> 45:10.540]  But, well, I had a lemon skunk that, from a.
[45:10.820 --> 45:12.020]  From Arion?
[45:12.020 --> 45:12.860]  Yeah, sure.
[45:12.860 --> 45:17.020]  I wasn't gonna name him, but hey, it was a good phenotype.
[45:17.020 --> 45:18.780]  That's what I had the lemon Jeffrey with,
[45:18.780 --> 45:19.660]  was the lemon skunk. Oh, okay.
[45:19.660 --> 45:20.500]  Yeah, it's the lemon skunk and golden goat.
[45:21.020 --> 45:22.700]  I thought you had the DNA one, but.
[45:23.660 --> 45:25.420]  I think they're pretty much the same thing, honestly.
[45:25.420 --> 45:28.640]  Anybody seen, okay, so would.
[45:30.740 --> 45:31.980]  No, this is a stupid question.
[45:31.980 --> 45:32.940]  Are we still recording?
[45:32.940 --> 45:34.180]  We're still totally recording.
[45:34.180 --> 45:35.700]  Okay, I'm gonna ask a stupid question anyway,
[45:35.700 --> 45:36.540]  but I don't know if it's.
[45:36.540 --> 45:38.260]  I'll introduce you to the NC, you'll know it's over.
[45:38.260 --> 45:39.980]  I don't know if it is a stupid question.
[45:39.980 --> 45:44.540]  So, OGs are not a phenotype.
[45:44.540 --> 45:47.300]  They are, like, it would be a gene.
[45:47.300 --> 45:48.540]  Genotype. Okay.
[45:48.540 --> 45:50.460]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[45:51.300 --> 45:52.620]  Lately, I think OG is just a sticker
[45:52.620 --> 45:56.180]  used by a dispensary or a seed breeder for dollar signs.
[45:57.140 --> 45:58.020]  Very well put.
[45:58.020 --> 45:59.300]  Yeah, that's the every.
[45:59.300 --> 46:02.140]  True OGs, like the, you know.
[46:02.140 --> 46:02.980]  OG Kush?
[46:02.980 --> 46:04.100]  Yeah, the original ones.
[46:04.100 --> 46:05.100]  Scott Walker.
[46:05.100 --> 46:07.780]  Yeah, according to the story,
[46:07.780 --> 46:11.220]  there's a bunch of different phenotypes of the genotype.
[46:11.220 --> 46:12.220]  I don't know.
[46:12.220 --> 46:13.860]  Underdog, that's a good story.
[46:15.060 --> 46:18.060]  I really think there's two underdogs,
[46:18.220 --> 46:20.420]  and both of them are pretty well known, so.
[46:22.260 --> 46:23.780]  You guys gotta, speaking of OG Kush,
[46:23.780 --> 46:25.500]  I'm gonna shout out another podcast.
[46:25.500 --> 46:27.100]  It's called The Adam Dunn Show.
[46:27.100 --> 46:29.860]  They did an episode all about OG Kush.
[46:29.860 --> 46:30.900]  I haven't listened to that yet.
[46:30.900 --> 46:31.740]  It went up today.
[46:31.740 --> 46:32.820]  I have not had a chance to listen.
[46:32.820 --> 46:33.940]  It's not on iTunes right now.
[46:33.940 --> 46:35.500]  They're having a little problem,
[46:35.500 --> 46:36.540]  but you can listen to them.
[46:36.540 --> 46:37.540]  They're on-
[46:37.540 --> 46:38.380]  YouTube?
[46:38.380 --> 46:39.220]  Yeah, it's YouTube,
[46:39.220 --> 46:40.780]  and I think it's iCannabisRadio.com.
[46:40.780 --> 46:41.780]  Yeah, either one.
[46:41.780 --> 46:42.700]  Yeah.
[46:42.700 --> 46:46.100]  Recorded shows on iCannabis.com.
[46:46.180 --> 46:48.460]  Those guys talk about a lot of great shit.
[46:48.460 --> 46:50.980]  On YouTube is The Adam Dunn Show.
[46:50.980 --> 46:53.060]  Yeah, shout out to Adam Dunn and Mitch Shannasa.
[46:53.060 --> 46:54.380]  They probably don't listen to our show
[46:54.380 --> 46:55.900]  because they have their own,
[46:55.900 --> 46:58.020]  but they get a lot of cool guests on
[46:58.020 --> 46:58.860]  because they're in Denver,
[46:58.860 --> 47:00.260]  and because Adam's got a seed company
[47:00.260 --> 47:02.660]  that is very well known from Holland to Denver, so.
[47:02.660 --> 47:05.620]  Mitch seems to be pretty well connected.
[47:05.620 --> 47:08.260]  Mitch has a new book out, which is great.
[47:08.260 --> 47:10.260]  Check out Mitch Shannasa's new book,
[47:10.260 --> 47:14.060]  The Cannabis Aficionados Handbook, I believe it's called.
[47:14.060 --> 47:14.900]  Yeah.
[47:14.900 --> 47:15.740]  Correct.
[47:16.740 --> 47:19.300]  My pothead memory just pulled that out of nowhere.
[47:20.740 --> 47:22.500]  It's easy to remember pothead things.
[47:22.500 --> 47:24.420]  Have you ever grown any TH seeds?
[47:25.300 --> 47:26.620]  No, not actually.
[47:26.620 --> 47:27.460]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[47:27.460 --> 47:28.820]  Uh-oh.
[47:28.820 --> 47:30.820]  Yeah, I grew sage and sour as a freebie.
[47:30.820 --> 47:32.180]  Okay.
[47:32.180 --> 47:33.820]  I didn't really like it.
[47:33.820 --> 47:34.820]  That was just my opinion.
[47:34.820 --> 47:37.940]  I've heard that called old man's weed, so there you go.
[47:37.940 --> 47:38.860]  Okay, that makes sense.
[47:38.860 --> 47:41.500]  I wasn't ever a fan of the sage, and it won cups.
[47:41.500 --> 47:42.340]  Yeah.
[47:42.340 --> 47:43.180]  So, yeah.
[47:43.180 --> 47:45.060]  Sage, I did like,
[47:45.100 --> 47:50.100]  I know it's an acronym, but it does have a sagey taste to it.
[47:50.100 --> 47:52.300]  I think it's mental probably now.
[47:52.300 --> 47:54.500]  Like, everybody says that probably.
[47:54.500 --> 47:56.660]  Well, even if it is, I don't like it.
[47:56.660 --> 47:58.100]  Yeah, I wouldn't put that.
[47:58.100 --> 47:59.100]  Yeah, yeah, that's.
[48:00.260 --> 48:01.620]  I like kush, and
[48:04.180 --> 48:07.060]  I'd say I've never smoked a true chem
[48:07.060 --> 48:08.860]  or a really, really good sour.
[48:08.860 --> 48:10.700]  I smoked some sours, but not like.
[48:10.700 --> 48:12.660]  There's a sour diesel cut that goes around here.
[48:12.660 --> 48:13.740]  Have you smoked any of that?
[48:13.740 --> 48:14.940]  I think I grew it.
[48:15.820 --> 48:16.660]  I grew it, and I smoked it.
[48:16.660 --> 48:18.620]  I just still wasn't a fan of it.
[48:19.500 --> 48:24.340]  I don't know, I might be looking for a different soury taste,
[48:24.340 --> 48:26.340]  but I've had,
[48:27.780 --> 48:29.820]  I work, where I work at, we have one.
[48:29.820 --> 48:31.020]  Still haven't smoked it.
[48:32.740 --> 48:33.780]  It's pretty good.
[48:33.780 --> 48:34.620]  It's pretty good.
[48:34.620 --> 48:35.460]  For a sour diesel.
[48:35.460 --> 48:36.740]  Is that the G diesel?
[48:36.740 --> 48:37.580]  Yeah.
[48:37.580 --> 48:38.860]  Yeah, that's the one.
[48:38.860 --> 48:39.820]  Yeah, you'll like that.
[48:39.820 --> 48:40.660]  You'll love that.
[48:40.660 --> 48:41.500]  That's dank.
[48:41.500 --> 48:44.100]  Yeah, when it's done well, that stuff is, you know.
[48:44.100 --> 48:47.020]  Actually, my friend Josh from La Plata Labs
[48:47.020 --> 48:49.460]  rolled a joint of that shit one night at a party,
[48:49.460 --> 48:50.900]  and there were a bunch of breeders in the room,
[48:50.900 --> 48:53.220]  and they all gathered around that joint, yeah.
[48:53.220 --> 48:54.060]  So for a bunch of breeders to jump up.
[48:54.060 --> 48:55.980]  Was that your joint?
[48:55.980 --> 48:57.500]  No, no, it was not mine.
[48:58.620 --> 49:00.420]  Damn, I was hoping to hear that Fino
[49:00.420 --> 49:02.060]  was more of a SoCo thing.
[49:03.700 --> 49:06.340]  Well, actually, it was Durango is where they're from,
[49:06.340 --> 49:08.100]  so it's SoCo.
[49:08.100 --> 49:10.500]  Yeah, that's hometown.
[49:10.500 --> 49:12.060]  Nice, shout out La Plata.
[49:12.060 --> 49:17.060]  Yeah, yeah, I haven't been back in 13 years, regrettably.
[49:17.540 --> 49:19.180]  Every summer I plan a trip over there,
[49:19.180 --> 49:21.700]  and it never happens, but I'm totally going
[49:21.700 --> 49:24.020]  to cruise through their shop when I do get over there.
[49:24.020 --> 49:25.740]  It's hard to do it being an outdoor farmer.
[49:25.740 --> 49:26.580]  Yeah.
[49:26.580 --> 49:27.900]  Yeah.
[49:27.900 --> 49:29.180]  Yeah, it's a long drive.
[49:29.180 --> 49:31.060]  Jesse brought me some eggs,
[49:31.060 --> 49:33.580]  and I cracked open one of those eggs,
[49:33.580 --> 49:35.860]  and it almost freaked me out because the yolk.
[49:35.860 --> 49:36.900]  Was it not crazy?
[49:36.900 --> 49:38.060]  Dude, oh man.
[49:38.060 --> 49:40.860]  It was like just two times, three times the size
[49:40.900 --> 49:42.260]  of what it's supposed to be.
[49:42.260 --> 49:43.820]  We think it's supposed to be.
[49:45.100 --> 49:47.060]  And they taste so much better.
[49:47.060 --> 49:49.060]  Yeah, store eggs make me nauseous when I eat them.
[49:49.060 --> 49:51.620]  Like, oh God, I can't believe I decided to cook this.
[49:51.620 --> 49:54.100]  Yeah, that's factory farming too, so.
[49:54.100 --> 49:55.980]  Jesse's eggs taste like food,
[49:55.980 --> 49:58.140]  and it seemed like I was supposed to be eating it.
[49:58.140 --> 49:59.900]  And then he brought me tomatoes,
[49:59.900 --> 50:01.820]  and honestly, after eating Jesse's tomatoes,
[50:01.820 --> 50:04.620]  I can't even go buy a tomato anywhere.
[50:04.620 --> 50:06.100]  I got food in Denver the other night,
[50:06.100 --> 50:07.260]  and it came with fresh tomatoes,
[50:07.260 --> 50:09.900]  and I bit into the tomatoes, and they taste like soggy mold.
[50:09.940 --> 50:12.820]  I am spoiled by Jesse's organic tomatoes.
[50:12.820 --> 50:15.740]  There is a deli downtown called Schlepp's
[50:15.740 --> 50:18.780]  that has my produce there, so.
[50:18.780 --> 50:20.740]  Shout out to them, bomb ass food.
[50:20.740 --> 50:23.340]  Buy local produce at Schlepp's in Pueblo.
[50:23.340 --> 50:24.540]  Grow your own veggies.
[50:24.540 --> 50:26.060]  They're on Main Street.
[50:26.060 --> 50:28.460]  And then I ate lunch at Bingo Burger today,
[50:28.460 --> 50:30.580]  and someone is supplying them
[50:30.580 --> 50:32.540]  with some bomb ass fucking produce too.
[50:32.540 --> 50:33.380]  Nice.
[50:33.380 --> 50:34.220]  Yeah.
[50:34.220 --> 50:35.040]  The Bingo Burger usually does pretty well.
[50:35.040 --> 50:35.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:35.880 --> 50:36.700]  That's good stuff.
[50:36.700 --> 50:37.540]  Very good place to eat.
[50:37.540 --> 50:39.140]  Yeah, so that's a free commercial for Bingo Burger
[50:39.140 --> 50:40.620]  from a bunch of potheads.
[50:40.620 --> 50:43.060]  If you're a vegetarian, get that mushroom burger.
[50:43.060 --> 50:44.060]  That's pretty tasty.
[50:45.060 --> 50:45.900]  You eat fish?
[50:47.020 --> 50:49.780]  You know, I've said that I won't eat fish anymore recently,
[50:49.780 --> 50:51.220]  but I may.
[50:51.220 --> 50:52.060]  What you got in mind?
[50:52.060 --> 50:52.900]  I'm just asking.
[50:52.900 --> 50:56.020]  They have a banging ass salmon burger that was off.
[50:56.020 --> 50:58.060]  Like, when I ordered it, I was like,
[50:58.060 --> 50:59.580]  I ordered it, and I was like, hold up.
[50:59.580 --> 51:01.300]  I need to go ask them if it's a filet
[51:01.300 --> 51:02.940]  or if it's like a patty.
[51:02.940 --> 51:03.780]  Yeah.
[51:03.780 --> 51:05.020]  I was like, so yo, is this a patty?
[51:05.020 --> 51:05.860]  Like, salmon patty?
[51:05.860 --> 51:06.780]  She's like, no, it's a filet.
[51:06.780 --> 51:07.820]  I was like, all right, cool.
[51:07.820 --> 51:08.660]  Let's do this.
[51:09.340 --> 51:10.220]  I saw that on the menu today,
[51:10.220 --> 51:13.300]  but I had already decided what I was gonna get.
[51:13.300 --> 51:15.700]  It's with green onions, avocado, tomato,
[51:15.700 --> 51:18.580]  lettuce, pesto sauce, and then you get
[51:18.580 --> 51:20.420]  like a whole wheat grain bun.
[51:20.420 --> 51:21.260]  Damn.
[51:21.260 --> 51:22.100]  You know what I'm saying?
[51:22.100 --> 51:22.940]  Everybody listening right now
[51:22.940 --> 51:23.780]  just got the munchies.
[51:23.780 --> 51:25.380]  We've been all taking dabs
[51:25.380 --> 51:26.380]  and talking about growing wheat,
[51:26.380 --> 51:28.580]  and now Spence just killed everybody.
[51:28.580 --> 51:30.660]  You've got the munchies.
[51:30.660 --> 51:33.140]  We know where all the best food in Pueblo is.
[51:33.140 --> 51:34.340]  Yeah, the potheads know where to eat.
[51:34.340 --> 51:36.580]  If you're a vegetarian, there's like four spots.
[51:36.580 --> 51:37.420]  That sucks.
[51:37.740 --> 51:38.700]  Feel bad for you.
[51:38.700 --> 51:39.540]  Just cook.
[51:39.540 --> 51:40.380]  Yeah.
[51:40.380 --> 51:41.220]  If you're a vegetarian.
[51:41.220 --> 51:42.060]  It totally makes you just cook at home.
[51:42.060 --> 51:43.860]  Makes me wanna open a vegetarian restaurant, though.
[51:43.860 --> 51:45.260]  Some of us would appreciate that.
[51:45.260 --> 51:46.100]  Yeah.
[51:46.100 --> 51:47.220]  Put a little section in the back
[51:47.220 --> 51:49.580]  where nobody can see what I'm doing back there,
[51:49.580 --> 51:52.620]  and don't bother me between bringing me plates of food.
[51:52.620 --> 51:53.460]  The office.
[51:53.460 --> 51:56.780]  Yeah, just call the place the office.
[51:56.780 --> 51:58.780]  It'd be hard to, in the winter,
[51:58.780 --> 52:00.900]  it'd be hard for me to have a vegetarian restaurant,
[52:00.900 --> 52:03.260]  because I'd just be so disappointed by the produce.
[52:03.260 --> 52:04.100]  Yeah.
[52:04.100 --> 52:04.940]  Yeah.
[52:05.780 --> 52:08.700]  Indoor organic vegetables would be really expensive.
[52:08.700 --> 52:10.540]  Hmm, I wonder, yeah.
[52:10.540 --> 52:11.380]  Yeah.
[52:11.380 --> 52:12.940]  Wonder if we could grow some vegetables.
[52:12.940 --> 52:15.060]  I think that's probably one of the downsides
[52:15.060 --> 52:16.080]  of the cannabis industry.
[52:16.080 --> 52:17.600]  Now, if you wanna build a greenhouse,
[52:17.600 --> 52:19.260]  there's certain you're gonna grow weed in it,
[52:19.260 --> 52:20.620]  so like $1 million.
[52:20.620 --> 52:21.460]  Yeah.
[52:21.460 --> 52:23.140]  That's actually, sorry, go ahead.
[52:23.140 --> 52:23.980]  No, I'm sure you have more.
[52:23.980 --> 52:25.580]  That's my retirement plan,
[52:25.580 --> 52:29.420]  but not for full of cannabis, and yeah.
[52:29.420 --> 52:31.300]  Yeah, greenhouse for vegetables.
[52:31.300 --> 52:34.300]  Yeah, flowers, vegetables, yeah.
[52:34.340 --> 52:35.180]  Lettuce.
[52:36.540 --> 52:37.700]  I feel like the music dropped out.
[52:37.700 --> 52:38.540]  I can fix it.
[52:38.540 --> 52:40.300]  Yeah, long time.
[52:40.300 --> 52:41.780]  I totally had something I was gonna say
[52:41.780 --> 52:43.780]  we should talk about, and just forgot.
[52:43.780 --> 52:47.180]  Oh, have you guys ever grown any produce inside?
[52:47.180 --> 52:48.780]  Not inside, myself.
[52:48.780 --> 52:52.180]  Not like actually fully ran it through.
[52:52.180 --> 52:54.900]  I put it inside to start seeding shit,
[52:54.900 --> 52:56.380]  but besides that, no.
[52:56.380 --> 52:58.060]  I've done, go ahead, Mike.
[52:58.060 --> 53:00.380]  Oh, it's because I did the little window side herbs
[53:00.380 --> 53:03.540]  and things like that, but nothing other than that.
[53:03.820 --> 53:07.420]  I've done real basic stuff, lettuce, basil.
[53:07.420 --> 53:10.300]  Tried a tomato plant one time, and it was taking up room,
[53:10.300 --> 53:12.660]  so it got put outside.
[53:14.540 --> 53:17.660]  I've grown some great shit outdoors, but never inside.
[53:17.660 --> 53:20.140]  Growing an outdoor vegetable crop for yourself is awesome.
[53:20.140 --> 53:21.180]  When you're eating a meal and you're like,
[53:21.180 --> 53:24.500]  I grew 90% of the stuff in this meal right now.
[53:24.500 --> 53:25.860]  If I knew how to make tortillas, man,
[53:25.860 --> 53:27.180]  I would be self-reliant.
[53:29.260 --> 53:30.100]  I can show you.
[53:30.100 --> 53:30.940]  Yeah, I live in Pueblo,
[53:30.940 --> 53:32.660]  so I'm sure learning how to make a tortilla.
[53:32.700 --> 53:35.500]  Smith's is looking at me like, he's gonna make tortillas.
[53:35.500 --> 53:38.620]  It'll be over all the time.
[53:40.340 --> 53:41.660]  Guys, we've almost gone for an hour.
[53:41.660 --> 53:43.380]  I bet if I put commercials on this thing,
[53:43.380 --> 53:45.660]  an intro and an outro, and a big shout out to TaskRock,
[53:45.660 --> 53:48.020]  I bet I could make this a nice even hour.
[53:48.020 --> 53:49.260]  You guys got anything fancy to say?
[53:49.260 --> 53:50.180]  I know I've asked that once,
[53:50.180 --> 53:52.580]  but we've rambled on for a few minutes since then.
[53:52.580 --> 53:54.380]  I wanna give a shout out to a chick.
[53:54.380 --> 53:56.020]  Ooh, a chick, huh?
[53:56.020 --> 53:57.060]  On Instagram.
[53:57.060 --> 53:59.460]  I think it's 710nurse or something like that.
[54:00.340 --> 54:01.700]  Oh, seriously?
[54:01.700 --> 54:04.980]  She replied to my shout out for the show.
[54:04.980 --> 54:06.380]  Hey, what's up, HippyNurse710?
[54:06.380 --> 54:07.220]  I know who you are.
[54:07.220 --> 54:08.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[54:08.340 --> 54:09.300]  Thanks for listening to the show.
[54:09.300 --> 54:10.260]  She's a loyal listener.
[54:10.260 --> 54:11.660]  I actually know that person in person,
[54:11.660 --> 54:13.140]  and we give her a lot of girl advice.
[54:13.140 --> 54:14.460]  I didn't know she shouted you out on the show.
[54:14.460 --> 54:15.300]  That's cool.
[54:15.300 --> 54:16.140]  What's up, chick?
[54:16.140 --> 54:16.980]  Thanks for listening.
[54:16.980 --> 54:19.580]  She let me know that she's listening.
[54:19.580 --> 54:20.420]  She's listening.
[54:20.420 --> 54:21.260]  She certainly is.
[54:21.260 --> 54:22.340]  She's cool as fuck.
[54:22.340 --> 54:24.060]  Yeah, she's got some outdoor stuff going on
[54:24.060 --> 54:25.860]  that looks pretty damn good.
[54:25.860 --> 54:27.020]  I mean, she could.
[54:28.220 --> 54:29.620]  Let's put pictures of it on fucking Facebook
[54:29.620 --> 54:30.460]  and Instagram.
[54:30.460 --> 54:31.300]  It's there.
[54:31.900 --> 54:32.740]  Let's call her out on that.
[54:32.740 --> 54:35.500]  Yeah, I might give her advice on that once in a while.
[54:35.500 --> 54:36.860]  Any shout outs over there, dude?
[54:36.860 --> 54:38.260]  You're all looking into your phone.
[54:38.260 --> 54:39.220]  No?
[54:39.220 --> 54:40.940]  Spence, shout outs, plugs?
[54:42.060 --> 54:42.900]  Let's see.
[54:43.780 --> 54:44.900]  Shout out to my lady.
[54:44.900 --> 54:45.940]  She just turned 21.
[54:45.940 --> 54:46.780]  Happy birthday.
[54:46.780 --> 54:47.900]  Happy birthday, Matty.
[54:47.900 --> 54:51.100]  You're finally old enough to go where we can all go now.
[54:53.300 --> 54:54.140]  We all love you.
[54:55.460 --> 54:59.460]  And then shout out to iRegenetics, Jeff,
[54:59.500 --> 55:03.460]  Jesse, Michael, anybody that's ever been on the show
[55:03.460 --> 55:06.460]  that's not here or anybody that supports the show.
[55:07.740 --> 55:09.460]  Thank you for supporting the show for sure.
[55:09.460 --> 55:10.740]  Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.
[55:10.740 --> 55:11.980]  Garden of Weeden.
[55:11.980 --> 55:15.660]  You gave me a shout out and I got like four new followers.
[55:15.660 --> 55:17.140]  Like, who's been sitting here?
[55:18.900 --> 55:19.900]  Garden of Weeden.
[55:19.900 --> 55:21.860]  Yeah, shout out to the whole Garden of Weeden crew.
[55:21.860 --> 55:23.820]  Even Fong way out there.
[55:23.820 --> 55:26.780]  All the guys in other states.
[55:26.780 --> 55:28.020]  I'm not gonna call out their states,
[55:28.540 --> 55:29.860]  but even if I met you once or twice
[55:29.860 --> 55:32.420]  in your Garden of Weeden crew, I know who you are still.
[55:35.620 --> 55:38.780]  There are events in Denver on Thursday.
[55:39.980 --> 55:40.820]  I'm not gonna-
[55:40.820 --> 55:41.660]  Thursday, bro.
[55:41.660 --> 55:42.740]  I know, well, tonight.
[55:42.740 --> 55:44.780]  We're doing a podcast while they're kicking it.
[55:44.780 --> 55:48.140]  But I just wanna say everybody get out in the community
[55:48.140 --> 55:51.860]  and start enjoying the atmosphere of what's going on.
[55:51.860 --> 55:54.420]  Because Colorado's a special place.
[55:54.420 --> 55:56.180]  Other states, you can't do what we do.
[55:56.180 --> 55:58.020]  We've got places where we can just go mingle
[55:58.020 --> 55:59.780]  and eat and hang out.
[55:59.780 --> 56:01.060]  Instead of getting drunk,
[56:01.060 --> 56:03.100]  we're taking dabs and smoking joints.
[56:03.100 --> 56:04.900]  So if you live here, go enjoy it.
[56:04.900 --> 56:06.620]  If you're up to it.
[56:06.620 --> 56:07.940]  If not, whatever.
[56:07.940 --> 56:10.420]  But if you're in the community, go enjoy.
[56:10.420 --> 56:11.420]  Yeah, come out.
[56:11.420 --> 56:13.300]  You don't have to be a certain type of person.
[56:13.300 --> 56:14.140]  You don't have to wear a certain thing.
[56:14.140 --> 56:15.780]  Nobody judges anybody there.
[56:15.780 --> 56:17.900]  We're all happy people that all like to smoke pot.
[56:17.900 --> 56:19.220]  Come taste some amazing herb.
[56:19.220 --> 56:21.020]  Come see what your herb can be grown like.
[56:21.020 --> 56:21.860]  Come meet a grower.
[56:21.860 --> 56:22.700]  Come meet a breeder.
[56:22.700 --> 56:23.540]  Yeah.
[56:23.540 --> 56:24.380]  If you're gonna come out,
[56:24.380 --> 56:26.020]  just don't mess it up for everyone else.
[56:26.860 --> 56:28.540]  You gotta learn how to behave yourself.
[56:28.540 --> 56:29.380]  Yeah.
[56:29.380 --> 56:31.260]  We're too high for crazy stuff.
[56:31.260 --> 56:33.980]  So we just kick it and smoke.
[56:33.980 --> 56:35.980]  But don't try to come take a gigantic dab
[56:35.980 --> 56:37.460]  and fall over and shit.
[56:37.460 --> 56:40.860]  Alcohol in these vents don't really seem to mess you.
[56:40.860 --> 56:43.140]  Not that it's ever been a problem.
[56:43.140 --> 56:44.580]  Very little alcohol consumption.
[56:44.580 --> 56:46.300]  It's just for the cotton mouth most of the time.
[56:46.300 --> 56:48.900]  But it's usually a fruity drink if you see it.
[56:48.900 --> 56:49.860]  For sure.
[56:49.860 --> 56:50.700]  For sure.
[56:50.700 --> 56:54.100]  This episode won't go out until the start of next month.
[56:54.100 --> 56:58.620]  So I'll be kind of busy for a couple of times here.
[56:58.620 --> 56:59.620]  So we're pre-recording.
[56:59.620 --> 57:01.220]  But look for us at events, guys.
[57:01.220 --> 57:02.060]  We're easy to find.
[57:02.060 --> 57:04.460]  We usually post it up on Facebook or Instagram
[57:04.460 --> 57:05.860]  when we're going somewhere.
[57:05.860 --> 57:07.700]  Go for it.
[57:07.700 --> 57:08.540]  Let's hear it.
[57:08.540 --> 57:09.540]  Because I was gonna say it's at Jesse Grows
[57:09.540 --> 57:10.500]  on Instagram and Twitter.
[57:10.500 --> 57:11.340]  So now you can jump in.
[57:11.340 --> 57:12.500]  Yeah, I'm on Twitter.
[57:12.500 --> 57:15.660]  Actually, it's at jessegrowsog.
[57:15.660 --> 57:17.060]  At jessegrowsog.
[57:17.060 --> 57:18.340]  Had to adjust some stuff.
[57:18.340 --> 57:19.180]  Had to adjust.
[57:19.180 --> 57:21.740]  I remember there was another guy.
[57:21.740 --> 57:23.540]  How did that even happen?
[57:23.580 --> 57:24.900]  Twitter don't care.
[57:24.900 --> 57:25.900]  Twitter don't care.
[57:27.020 --> 57:28.980]  It was Twitter painting on your shit.
[57:30.260 --> 57:32.180]  So it's at jessegrowsog.
[57:32.180 --> 57:36.300]  Check out Colorado Bearded Dabbers on Instagram.
[57:36.300 --> 57:37.500]  That's our buddy Michael over here.
[57:37.500 --> 57:38.460]  We'll get him on the show more
[57:38.460 --> 57:40.140]  because he's got a lot of good shit to say.
[57:40.140 --> 57:41.260]  People are always better on the show
[57:41.260 --> 57:42.660]  after the second or third time.
[57:42.660 --> 57:43.500]  For sure.
[57:43.500 --> 57:46.660]  Check out Garden of Weed N on Instagram for sure.
[57:46.660 --> 57:47.780]  He posts a lot of great pictures.
[57:47.780 --> 57:50.540]  Also make sure you check out at iRegenetics on Instagram.
[57:50.540 --> 57:51.860]  I post a lot of weed pictures.
[57:52.860 --> 57:56.260]  Trying to broaden my spectrum of type of pictures I post.
[57:56.260 --> 57:57.820]  Wait till you, the camera, man.
[57:57.820 --> 58:00.740]  I'm telling you, the camera will change your life.
[58:00.740 --> 58:02.540]  Because you can, listen, you can take,
[58:02.540 --> 58:05.020]  imagine all the pictures you can take of your plants.
[58:05.020 --> 58:08.380]  But then there's like dab pictures you can take.
[58:08.380 --> 58:09.220]  Oh yeah.
[58:09.220 --> 58:10.060]  There's all types.
[58:10.060 --> 58:10.900]  There's some, like if you wanna go.
[58:10.900 --> 58:12.060]  I'm that kind of guy that once I buy it,
[58:12.060 --> 58:13.500]  you're not gonna see me for like a week.
[58:13.500 --> 58:14.340]  You're gonna be like, where are you?
[58:14.340 --> 58:15.780]  Like, ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.
[58:15.780 --> 58:16.620]  Take your pictures, bro.
[58:16.620 --> 58:18.340]  Wanna come over and get your pictures taken?
[58:18.340 --> 58:20.260]  Yeah, yeah, so.
[58:20.340 --> 58:21.940]  Yeah, but you may have convinced me
[58:21.940 --> 58:23.300]  to just drive to Best Buy
[58:23.300 --> 58:24.780]  and go pick that shit up pretty soon.
[58:24.780 --> 58:26.620]  I really want one too.
[58:26.620 --> 58:28.020]  It's on my Christmas list.
[58:28.020 --> 58:29.180]  It was on my wedding registry.
[58:29.180 --> 58:31.420]  Or you could just wait till Black Friday.
[58:31.420 --> 58:32.940]  Yeah, you can probably catch one for a steal.
[58:32.940 --> 58:34.420]  But that's not the first one to say that.
[58:34.420 --> 58:35.900]  It's kind of far off if you wanna camera that.
[58:35.900 --> 58:37.460]  I don't think I need to support Black Friday.
[58:37.460 --> 58:40.020]  Yeah, that's the epitome of America.
[58:40.020 --> 58:41.980]  Cyber Monday sounds dirty.
[58:41.980 --> 58:43.140]  Hey, speaking of that,
[58:43.900 --> 58:48.460]  Hygro is, Hygro Supply is about to launch
[58:48.460 --> 58:53.140]  a nationwide website with the shipping department
[58:53.140 --> 58:53.980]  and all that stuff.
[58:53.980 --> 58:57.340]  And we'll have our, actually, I think the prices
[58:57.340 --> 58:59.700]  are gonna be a little bit lower than they are in the store.
[58:59.700 --> 59:01.380]  But nationwide shipping,
[59:01.380 --> 59:04.700]  and everyone can get great deals like we get here.
[59:05.860 --> 59:08.460]  And I believe there'll be an in-store pickup program too.
[59:08.460 --> 59:09.940]  Yeah, that'll be helpful.
[59:09.940 --> 59:12.900]  And the Tote of Soil deal is now over, you guys.
[59:13.660 --> 59:15.100]  Yeah, I was asked to.
[59:15.100 --> 59:16.180]  No, I didn't buy one.
[59:16.180 --> 59:18.060]  Where would I, where are you gonna put that shit?
[59:18.060 --> 59:20.740]  We sold a couple, but I never even saw one.
[59:20.740 --> 59:23.420]  I was wanting to see it, but I never got to see it.
[59:23.420 --> 59:26.620]  It was, how many gallons was it?
[59:26.620 --> 59:30.900]  I think it was, I said it would fill 48 seven-gallon pots.
[59:32.220 --> 59:33.180]  I should've got one.
[59:33.180 --> 59:34.660]  All right, yes.
[59:34.660 --> 59:35.500]  That was a deal.
[59:35.500 --> 59:36.340]  It could've lasted me a while.
[59:36.340 --> 59:37.900]  Yeah, but I don't need the,
[59:37.900 --> 59:39.980]  I can't, if you got the right spots, you could do it.
[59:39.980 --> 59:41.220]  Recycle.
[59:41.220 --> 59:42.060]  What is it?
[59:42.060 --> 59:45.140]  Reduce, recycle, reduce, reduce, reuse.
[59:45.140 --> 59:46.300]  Recycle, yeah.
[59:46.300 --> 59:47.420]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:47.420 --> 59:48.340]  Do that.
[59:48.340 --> 59:52.100]  The tote bag it came in, I really want one of those.
[59:52.100 --> 59:54.060]  You wanna grow some stuff in it?
[59:54.060 --> 59:54.900]  A huge one?
[59:54.900 --> 59:56.900]  No, it's great for recycling soil in.
[59:56.900 --> 59:59.460]  I was gonna say, make a great compost pile or something.
[59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.380]  Yeah, sweet.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.580]  All right, guys, we got three minutes before it's an hour.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.540]  We're gonna wrap up the show.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.660]  Hey, guys, thanks for listening.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.900]  Everybody out there in podcast world,
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.500]  we've been getting over a thousand listens.
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.340]  A thousand people are gonna hear all your guys'
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.180]  crazy voices.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.780]  Everybody's faces just changed.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.620]  Word.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.940]  Michael had no idea what he was getting into
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.140]  when he came here.
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:22.420]  I just wish y'all knew how crazy I look, but you don't.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:23.540]  We'll take some pictures.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.500]  We'll post them up.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.940]  We'll take some pictures and show everybody
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:26.900]  how crazy you are.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.020]  Sometimes he wears a grill.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.900]  He doesn't have the grill in today.
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.020]  When he wears the grill, white people get nervous.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.740]  I think it's really funny.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:34.900]  It is, it's hilarious.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.300]  We went to a wedding.
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:40.780]  Oh, maxed it out.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.940]  I wanna hear a wedding grill story.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.260]  I haven't heard one of those.
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.100]  Some of the normal people that were more normal
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:53.060]  were Spence and Maddie and myself and Slop and Big Mike
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.460]  were walking through the crowd and they kind of looked
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.620]  and they weren't sure if we were there
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:00.220]  to steal everyone's purse or if we were friends of the groom.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.660]  It was pretty funny.
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.740]  I thought it was pretty funny.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.060]  Everyone says they're the black sheep of their family,
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.660]  but actually, yeah.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.580]  You proved it that time.
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.420]  You proved it.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.940]  Big shout out to everybody that we saw at that wedding.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.460]  That was awesome, best wedding ever.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.820]  We keep talking about it on the show
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.220]  because it was amazingly cool.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.260]  It's been a month now and we're still.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:25.260]  Shout out to Bullheaded and Despicable Dialects
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.980]  and Con and Boogie for rocking it that night.

[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.660]  They were good.
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.740]  Yeah, yeah, I'm glad you got to say that.
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.340]  Finally, I'm glad to have you back on the show
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.460]  just for that 30 seconds of stuff, if nothing else.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.100]  All right, guys, I mean it this time.
