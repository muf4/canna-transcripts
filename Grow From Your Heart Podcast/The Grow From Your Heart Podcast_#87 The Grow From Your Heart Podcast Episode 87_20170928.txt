[00:17.720 --> 00:20.200]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.200 --> 00:23.480]  It's time for episode number 87 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.640 --> 00:26.840]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.480 --> 00:29.600]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.840 --> 00:33.280]  if you're a new smoker or a hardcore dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:33.480 --> 00:36.240]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.280 --> 00:39.920]  this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host.
[00:39.960 --> 00:43.200]  They call me Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining me. As always,
[00:43.200 --> 00:45.840]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting
[00:45.840 --> 00:48.840]  me use their music on the show. Big thanks to Kat, Coop,

[01:54.040 --> 01:56.200]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Fred Garvin.
[01:56.200 --> 01:57.720]  I'm going to turn this music down just a little more,
[01:58.320 --> 02:00.200]  but I want to give a huge shout out to Fred Garvin.
[02:00.600 --> 02:04.720]  I posted something to Facebook and Fred politely commented saying, Hey Jeff,
[02:04.720 --> 02:05.760]  you've been doing a great job,
[02:05.800 --> 02:08.360]  but you've kind of strayed away from the grow lessons.
[02:09.360 --> 02:12.960]  And he asked for more grow lessons. Fred, I can't agree with you more.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.600]  I have strayed away from the grow lessons that I've tried to provide you.
[02:15.640 --> 02:19.040]  There's been so much great news. I don't know that all of the news has been great,
[02:19.040 --> 02:22.400]  but there's been so much important news that I felt like it's been my job to
[02:22.400 --> 02:25.520]  bring that news to the cannabis world. So you're right.
[02:25.520 --> 02:28.720]  I have gotten a little bit away from the grow lessons and I got a lot into the
[02:28.720 --> 02:31.440]  news, but you know what? We're going to get back into grow lessons.
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.120]  I've got a part of this will be a little bit about grow lessons.
[02:35.160 --> 02:37.560]  And then the next episode is going to be about pH,
[02:37.600 --> 02:41.320]  which is all about growing. So Fred, you're totally correct. And I will fix that.
[02:41.320 --> 02:45.280]  We'll get back to the grow lessons, my friend. But before we get that far,
[02:45.280 --> 02:45.800]  I know I just said,
[02:45.800 --> 02:47.840]  we're going to get back into grow lessons and get away from the news,
[02:47.880 --> 02:50.080]  but I've already had this episode planned.
[02:50.080 --> 02:53.440]  So you're going to have to bear with me because there's a very important news
[02:53.440 --> 02:55.000]  article that I want to read to you.
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  I'm thumbing through my computer here trying to find it now to tell you the
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.600]  truth. There we go. All right, we're going to get right to it.
[02:59.600 --> 03:01.280]  This news article comes from the cannabis.
[03:01.960 --> 03:05.880]  I found this very important since I have recently taken over as the lead grower
[03:05.920 --> 03:08.040]  at the spot dispensary in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.960]  Now that I am running a large facility, things like this really stand out to me.
[03:11.960 --> 03:13.280]  So let's get right to the article. You guys,
[03:13.480 --> 03:16.760]  this is from the cannabis and it was written by Kristen Wyatt of the Associated
[03:16.760 --> 03:21.600]  Press. The headline is unknowns abound in pesticide use for growing pot.
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.640]  Then the sub headline says there is no federal agency that will recognize this
[03:25.840 --> 03:30.520]  as a legitimate crop pest management information regarding this crop devolves to
[03:30.520 --> 03:33.240]  internet chats. And hearsay says Whitney Crenshaw,
[03:33.280 --> 03:37.320]  a Colorado state university entomologist and pesticide expert.
[03:37.800 --> 03:42.080]  So obviously this is going to be about pesticides and bugs and cannabis plants.
[03:42.720 --> 03:44.120]  So the article goes like this.
[03:44.480 --> 03:48.400]  Microscopic bugs and mildew can destroy a marijuana operation faster than any
[03:48.400 --> 03:51.520]  police raid. And because the crop has been illegal for so long,
[03:51.720 --> 03:55.440]  neither growers nor scientists have any reliable research to help fight the
[03:55.440 --> 03:58.800]  infestations. Uh, if you guys have ever grown any cannabis,
[03:58.800 --> 04:02.720]  you'll know that the number one obstacle can be bugs for you.
[04:02.720 --> 04:03.960]  Once bugs show up,
[04:04.280 --> 04:07.800]  it is hard as hell to get rid of bugs in a grow room if you're not experienced.
[04:07.800 --> 04:10.000]  And if you don't know what you're doing, so we'll keep going.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.040]  It says as legal marijuana moves from basements and backwoods to warehouses and
[04:14.040 --> 04:15.000]  commercial fields,
[04:15.240 --> 04:18.640]  the mold and spider mites that once ruined only a few plants at a time can now
[04:18.640 --> 04:21.640]  quickly create a multimillion dollar crisis for growers.
[04:22.120 --> 04:26.040]  Some returning to industrial strength chemicals, raising concerns about safety.
[04:26.680 --> 04:29.280]  Uh, and they say multimillion dollar crisis for growers.
[04:29.280 --> 04:31.440]  They are not kidding you guys. Um,
[04:31.680 --> 04:34.280]  the facility that we, uh, that I am working in,
[04:34.320 --> 04:35.960]  that I am helping them finish build.
[04:36.480 --> 04:41.000]  We have four flowering rooms and one of those rooms has
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.840]  26 Govita lights hanging in there. Um,
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.360]  our projections are almost anybody's goal. If you're growing with a Govita,
[04:49.400 --> 04:50.920]  your goal is two pounds per light.
[04:51.440 --> 04:55.920]  So that's 52 projected pounds of cannabis coming out of that room. Uh,
[04:55.920 --> 04:58.680]  I can't really tell you what the going rate is for a pound of cannabis in
[04:58.680 --> 05:03.320]  Colorado right now at a retail center or being sold from retail to retail
[05:03.320 --> 05:05.960]  center. But that is quite an investment.
[05:05.960 --> 05:08.280]  If I were to fuck up 52 pounds of weed,
[05:08.840 --> 05:10.720]  that would really cost us quite a bit of money.
[05:10.840 --> 05:15.160]  We would not make the money we planned on making. Uh, it would, that's,
[05:15.200 --> 05:17.240]  that's a bummer in the first place. Then you can't pay the bills.
[05:17.560 --> 05:21.200]  Then you're short money. Then you don't have product on the shelf. Uh,
[05:21.240 --> 05:22.280]  it would cause a lot of problems.
[05:22.400 --> 05:26.240]  Obviously you can see how one 52 pound harvest could really cause a lot of
[05:26.240 --> 05:29.840]  problems. And then you've got all the wasted time and the wasted plants,
[05:29.840 --> 05:33.240]  because the plants cost money, uh, all the wasted nutrients,
[05:33.560 --> 05:36.920]  all the wasted electricity. It could really add up quickly.
[05:37.600 --> 05:41.120]  So I'm going to continue the article here. Where was I?
[05:41.120 --> 05:44.520]  It says herbicides and insecticides are regulated by the federal government,
[05:44.520 --> 05:47.760]  which still regards almost all marijuana as an illicit crop.
[05:47.780 --> 05:50.200]  So there's no roadmap to help pot farmers,
[05:50.560 --> 05:53.640]  chemists and horticulturalists can't offer much assistance either.
[05:53.960 --> 05:57.760]  They sometimes disagree about how to combat the problem largely because the plant
[05:57.760 --> 06:00.720]  is used in many different ways, smoked, eaten,
[06:00.720 --> 06:02.360]  and sometimes rubbed into the skin.
[06:03.240 --> 06:06.640]  We have an industry that's been illegal for so many years that there's no
[06:06.640 --> 06:09.920]  research. There's no guidelines. There's nothing said Frank Conrad,
[06:09.920 --> 06:14.680]  lab director of Colorado green lab, a pot testing lab in Denver and states that
[06:14.680 --> 06:15.680]  regulate marijuana.
[06:15.720 --> 06:19.520]  Officials are just starting to draft rules governing safe levels of chemicals.
[06:19.880 --> 06:24.400]  So far there've been no reports on any human illness trace to chemicals used on
[06:24.400 --> 06:27.800]  marijuana, but worries do persist the city of Denver,
[06:27.800 --> 06:31.840]  the spring quarantine tens of thousands of marijuana plants at 11 growing
[06:31.840 --> 06:36.440]  facilities. After health inspectors suspected use of unauthorized pesticides.
[06:36.800 --> 06:40.000]  Some of the plants were later released after tests revealed the pot was safe,
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.280]  but two producers voluntarily destroyed their plants. Uh,
[06:44.280 --> 06:48.600]  actually there was about 600 pounds of cannabis voluntarily
[06:48.600 --> 06:52.640]  destroyed, uh, because of illegal pesticides. Uh,
[06:52.680 --> 06:55.920]  the big article says eight businesses still have at least some plants in
[06:55.920 --> 06:59.480]  quarantine. The article goes on to say in Oregon,
[06:59.480 --> 07:03.280]  a June investigation by the Oregonian newspaper found pesticides in excess of
[07:03.280 --> 07:07.280]  legal limits on produce on products ranging from marijuana buds to
[07:07.280 --> 07:08.880]  concentrated marijuana oils.
[07:09.360 --> 07:12.720]  Other pesticides detected on the marijuana are not regulated by Oregon's
[07:12.720 --> 07:13.600]  marijuana rules,
[07:13.600 --> 07:17.640]  meaning that products containing those chemicals still can be sold there.
[07:18.360 --> 07:20.240]  The U S environmental protection agency,
[07:20.240 --> 07:24.640]  which decides which pesticides can be used on which crops just said last month
[07:24.640 --> 07:28.360]  that Colorado and Washington authorities that they could apply to have some
[07:28.360 --> 07:32.680]  cannabis related chemicals approved through what's called a special local need
[07:32.680 --> 07:36.040]  registration. But that process could take years.
[07:36.680 --> 07:39.480]  So it looks like we're on our way, but it could take years. It says here,
[07:40.160 --> 07:43.920]  it goes on to say Colorado and Oregon require retail marijuana to undergo
[07:43.920 --> 07:46.200]  testing for pesticides and other contaminants.
[07:46.480 --> 07:48.720]  But as the Oregon investigation showed,
[07:48.720 --> 07:52.560]  the testing regimes are imperfect and Colorado hasn't yet implemented
[07:52.560 --> 07:56.840]  requirements for retail pot to undergo pesticide testing because of regulatory
[07:56.880 --> 07:59.640]  delays. There aren't any labs here that will test for it yet. You guys,
[07:59.640 --> 08:01.440]  that's part of the problem. Uh,
[08:01.440 --> 08:04.000]  Washington state is still working on its pesticide rules.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.120]  The nation's largest marijuana producer,
[08:06.120 --> 08:09.800]  California has no regulations at all for growing commercial pot.
[08:10.400 --> 08:11.240]  And you know,
[08:11.480 --> 08:16.480]  up until this industry got hugely popular on a recreational and legal level,
[08:18.480 --> 08:23.480]  the guidelines and the people who were responsible for a quality control were
[08:25.280 --> 08:29.400]  the growers. We were the ones responsible for that. It was a craft.
[08:29.400 --> 08:31.600]  It was an art. It was something that we were proud of.
[08:31.640 --> 08:35.840]  We would not let out a product that had been sprayed with some bullshit or a
[08:35.840 --> 08:37.720]  product that had powdery mildew on it.
[08:38.280 --> 08:41.600]  We were the ones who were responsible for that and took that,
[08:41.800 --> 08:43.200]  that responsibility.
[08:43.200 --> 08:47.160]  And now that it's so commercially popular and everybody's buying and growing and
[08:47.160 --> 08:50.720]  selling cannabis, the art and the love. Ooh, I hope you guys heard that.
[08:50.720 --> 08:54.200]  That was some amazing thunder. It's finally raining. We've needed it. Uh,
[08:54.200 --> 08:57.960]  but it was my responsibility. And now that it's so popular,
[08:57.960 --> 08:59.040]  everyone's worried about the money.
[08:59.080 --> 09:02.320]  They've gotten away from the art and the pride and they're just doing whatever
[09:02.340 --> 09:05.080]  they can do to get plants on the ground,
[09:05.280 --> 09:09.480]  pounds out the door and money in the cash register and customers out the door.
[09:09.720 --> 09:13.680]  And that's not really what it's about. So since people have lost the heart,
[09:13.760 --> 09:16.440]  they're not growing from their heart. Like I try to teach them to do,
[09:16.760 --> 09:19.600]  we have to come up with some sort of testing and we have to create rules.
[09:19.600 --> 09:23.200]  And this is where we are. So it says it's a lot more difficult than it sounds.
[09:23.200 --> 09:25.000]  And it's expensive. Washington liquor board,
[09:25.280 --> 09:27.320]  Washington liquor control board spokesman,
[09:27.320 --> 09:31.360]  Brian Smith said about testing for pesticides. As a result,
[09:31.600 --> 09:35.360]  unscrupulous pot growers can use banned chemicals with little chance of being
[09:35.360 --> 09:39.960]  caught. Uh, we were taken by surprise. This whole pesticide, uh,
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.040]  taken by surprise, this whole pesticide issue said Ashley Kilroy,
[09:43.280 --> 09:45.000]  Denver's director of marijuana policy.
[09:45.320 --> 09:48.720]  She was talking to a room of about 200 pot industry workers who had invited.
[09:49.640 --> 09:53.480]  And, uh, yeah, it doesn't, it's missing a word here. Um,
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.720]  invited lunch after the invited to a lunch maybe, uh,
[09:57.760 --> 10:00.640]  earlier this month to learn about pesticide quarantines and rules. Sorry.
[10:00.640 --> 10:03.640]  They skipped a word in this article and it totally threw me off. Um, it's,
[10:03.720 --> 10:07.760]  it just says invited lunch. So that's weird. Uh, we'll keep going.
[10:07.960 --> 10:09.760]  What the growers heard wasn't encouraging.
[10:09.800 --> 10:13.800]  There's no federal agency that will recognize this as a legitimate crop said
[10:13.820 --> 10:18.040]  Whitney Crenshaw, a Colorado state university entomologist and pesticide expert.
[10:18.560 --> 10:20.920]  Regulators just bury their heads. And as a result,
[10:20.920 --> 10:25.640]  pest management information regarding this crop devolves to internet chats and
[10:25.640 --> 10:30.480]  hearsay. And you guys don't want to go start reading about how to battle bugs or
[10:30.480 --> 10:32.960]  powdery mildew on a large scale on the internet,
[10:32.980 --> 10:35.240]  because there's so much bullshit that you'll have to feed through that.
[10:35.240 --> 10:36.760]  If you don't have a good base knowledge,
[10:36.780 --> 10:38.920]  it'll just confuse you and mess you up even more.
[10:39.400 --> 10:43.280]  So marijuana growers are indeed guessing when they treat their plants.
[10:43.320 --> 10:46.120]  For example, one of the chemicals cited in Denver quarantines,
[10:46.400 --> 10:48.880]  a fungicide called Eagle 20, uh,
[10:48.880 --> 10:50.760]  is commonly used on grapes and hops,
[10:50.800 --> 10:54.680]  but can become dangerous when heated and is banned for use on tobacco.
[10:55.080 --> 10:58.920]  No research exists on whether the fungicide is safe for use on pot that will be
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.680]  eaten. Now, something I've read recently about, uh,
[11:02.720 --> 11:06.920]  exactly Eagle 20 is Eagle 20 gets inside of a per, okay.
[11:06.920 --> 11:08.520]  It goes in the plant is what it does.
[11:08.520 --> 11:13.440]  And it stops the plant from producing powdery mildew and it can last
[11:13.440 --> 11:15.720]  for 60 to 90 days in the plant.
[11:16.800 --> 11:20.240]  So that's a little crazy if you understand the plant biology there,
[11:20.240 --> 11:22.520]  but also what I've read is if it gets on your skin,
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.760]  it absorbs into your skin and it changes your RNA and you won't notice it
[11:27.760 --> 11:31.000]  because you might not live long enough to even notice the changes that occurred
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.640]  in your body. But your grandchildren will be affected by this.
[11:34.680 --> 11:39.200]  Your grandchildren will have birth defects, attention deficit disorders. Uh,
[11:39.400 --> 11:42.520]  I can't guarantee they will, but that is what this type of chemical does.
[11:42.840 --> 11:43.960]  It doesn't fuck you up,
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.600]  but it messes you up in the insides to where your kids kids are messed up,
[11:47.640 --> 11:51.560]  which is, that's gotta be some serious, dangerous shit that I don't want to mess
[11:51.560 --> 11:55.120]  with. I don't want sprayed on my plants. I don't want sprayed on your plants.
[11:55.120 --> 11:55.960]  We'll keep going here.
[11:56.520 --> 11:59.960]  Several pot growers interviewed by the associated press agreed that research is
[11:59.960 --> 12:01.680]  needed on pesticides for pot,
[12:01.680 --> 12:05.440]  but they pointed out that pesticides are widely used on food crops and that weed
[12:05.440 --> 12:09.160]  consumers have never before had as much information about the marijuana they buy.
[12:09.840 --> 12:12.240]  It's just like broccoli or spinach or peaches or anything.
[12:12.320 --> 12:16.280]  The plant is susceptible to certain pests said Gabriel Fairforth.
[12:16.720 --> 12:19.640]  I think I said that right. Fair, fair, orth anyway,
[12:20.120 --> 12:22.320]  who is cultivation manager of Denver's herbal remedies.
[12:22.320 --> 12:23.760]  I apologize for butchering your name there.
[12:24.600 --> 12:27.920]  Uh, fair worth does not use any banned chemicals on his plants and it was not
[12:27.920 --> 12:31.040]  affected by the quarantines, but he questioned some of the banned chemicals.
[12:31.560 --> 12:34.080]  If you have all these chemicals that are safe on products you eat,
[12:34.080 --> 12:36.920]  but you can't use them on marijuana. I don't know that I agree with that.
[12:37.680 --> 12:41.160]  The founder of the nation's oldest marijuana legalization advocacy group,
[12:41.840 --> 12:43.880]  Keith Stroup of the normal organization,
[12:44.600 --> 12:48.000]  a national organization for the reform of marijuana laws pointed out that
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.680]  regulators today are at least starting to look at marijuana safely. In the 1980s,
[12:52.680 --> 12:55.920]  the federal government used an herbicide called Paraquat to kill illicit
[12:55.920 --> 12:56.840]  marijuana crops.
[12:57.160 --> 13:00.280]  Even though the poison had been banned from national forest because of
[13:00.280 --> 13:01.640]  environmental concerns,
[13:02.040 --> 13:05.240]  normal complain to the white house that some of the weeds survived and was
[13:05.240 --> 13:08.720]  turning up on the street. The response was it's illegal.
[13:08.760 --> 13:12.240]  And we don't have any obligation not to poison it. Stroup recalled.
[13:12.560 --> 13:16.560]  No one was taking us seriously. That is kind of sick that they poisoned this weed,
[13:16.560 --> 13:19.240]  the weed made it to the street. And when they said, Hey, this weeds out there,
[13:19.240 --> 13:21.800]  they went not our problem, bro. It's illegal. Don't fuck with it.
[13:22.520 --> 13:24.600]  Oh, it's tough love from the government right there.
[13:25.200 --> 13:28.680]  Recent actions by States with legal weed have been encouraging. If slow,
[13:28.680 --> 13:30.920]  he said the idea that it's been up, uh,
[13:30.960 --> 13:32.760]  it's been on the black market and people are fine.
[13:32.760 --> 13:34.760]  So therefore we don't need testing as absurd.
[13:34.760 --> 13:39.600]  Stroup said no one would want to be using a product that holds has molds or
[13:39.600 --> 13:42.560]  pesticides. And that is very true.
[13:42.560 --> 13:45.840]  Nobody wants to smoke a product that has mold or pesticides in it.
[13:45.840 --> 13:48.480]  That's just gross. Why do you even want to put that into your body?
[13:48.480 --> 13:51.240]  Why do you want to put that in your pipe? Why do you as a grower,
[13:51.240 --> 13:54.080]  why would you want to put that out there? Why would you act like you're proud?
[13:54.080 --> 13:58.000]  Why would you even sell that to somebody? That's just weirdness to me.
[13:58.480 --> 14:01.760]  So that article came from, I'm scrolling back up to remember her name.
[14:01.760 --> 14:04.400]  It is Kristen Wyatt from the associated press.
[14:06.120 --> 14:09.320]  No, sorry. I got to clear my throat here. Let me take a quick drink.
[14:16.940 --> 14:19.380]  Sorry. I needed a drink. All right. So as a grower,
[14:19.620 --> 14:23.020]  I find it kind of wrong that people would even spray some of this shit on their
[14:23.020 --> 14:26.580]  plants. I don't use anything that is not completely organic. And honestly,
[14:26.580 --> 14:28.060]  I avoid using sprays,
[14:28.620 --> 14:33.220]  but since I work at a grow and I go to a lot of grows and know that I'm putting
[14:33.220 --> 14:37.580]  myself at risk. So I need some sort of safety net. So I do use products.
[14:38.020 --> 14:42.380]  I try not to use too much neem oil because neem oil will definitely affect the
[14:42.380 --> 14:45.420]  flavor of my extracts. So there are certain things that I'll use,
[14:45.620 --> 14:46.860]  certain things that I won't use.
[14:46.860 --> 14:50.300]  And we've definitely been talking about what we will and won't use at the shop
[14:50.340 --> 14:54.620]  because there are things that we definitely do not want to put in our crop at
[14:54.620 --> 14:55.460]  the shop.
[14:55.500 --> 14:59.060]  So I think if you guys are going to grow weed or cannabis or pot or whatever you
[14:59.060 --> 15:01.660]  want to call it, think about who's going to consume the products that you're
[15:01.660 --> 15:02.500]  growing.
[15:02.620 --> 15:05.980]  Our goal is to make people feel better and not give them cancer or lung disease.
[15:06.020 --> 15:07.940]  All right. So don't spray some shit on your plants.
[15:07.940 --> 15:09.660]  It's going to give somebody cancer or lung disease.
[15:09.900 --> 15:13.660]  Don't spray anything on your plants that you wouldn't spray on your produce and
[15:13.660 --> 15:16.540]  then eat it. I think that's what that should be our new guideline.
[15:16.980 --> 15:21.260]  And also you guys think about what would happen if we gave some contaminated
[15:21.260 --> 15:23.860]  products to a person with a compromised immune system.
[15:24.100 --> 15:27.580]  I'm a caregiver and one of my favorite patients,
[15:27.580 --> 15:30.860]  I'm a medical marijuana caregiver, which means I am, uh,
[15:30.860 --> 15:35.660]  I am responsible for growing a few people's medical cannabis.
[15:35.660 --> 15:40.140]  And I've got a patient, his name is Doug and Doug's an older dude. Uh,
[15:40.180 --> 15:43.780]  he's over 50 years old and he's not in good health since I've known him.
[15:43.780 --> 15:47.340]  He's had three or four major health problems in just the few years that I've
[15:47.340 --> 15:51.820]  known him. I grow medical cannabis for Doug to make Doug feel better.
[15:52.220 --> 15:55.500]  I grow medical cannabis for Doug to help Doug live longer.
[15:55.860 --> 15:59.980]  I'm trying to improve Doug's life when I'm mixing up nutrients and reading the
[15:59.980 --> 16:03.180]  back of a nutrient bottle. I'm kind of thinking about Doug's lungs.
[16:03.220 --> 16:05.860]  I'm thinking about Doug's heart. I'm thinking about Doug's kidneys.
[16:05.860 --> 16:09.340]  I'm thinking about Doug's high thing about Doug, because I don't want to kill Doug.
[16:09.380 --> 16:13.060]  I want to make Doug feel better. So if I see powdery mildew in a crop,
[16:13.180 --> 16:14.940]  I cut the crop down. I cleaned the room.
[16:14.940 --> 16:17.300]  I start over and figure out why I got powdery mildew.
[16:17.700 --> 16:19.780]  If I have to spray some shit on there,
[16:19.820 --> 16:24.300]  I think about Doug before I apply anything I read, I research.
[16:24.580 --> 16:27.020]  I try to be good to myself. I try to be good to Doug.
[16:27.020 --> 16:28.220]  I try to be good to anybody else.
[16:28.220 --> 16:31.380]  That's going to smoke this stuff or eat this stuff or make hash out of this
[16:31.380 --> 16:35.540]  stuff because it's going into a sick person's body and we don't want to kill
[16:35.540 --> 16:38.420]  them. We want to make them feel better.
[16:39.940 --> 16:41.660]  So a lot of people, I wrote this down.
[16:41.660 --> 16:44.140]  A lot of people are going to have the excuse that they didn't know they were
[16:44.140 --> 16:48.100]  using some dangerous pesticides. Like I said earlier, as a grower,
[16:48.140 --> 16:52.420]  that is your responsibility. You're supposed to read every bottle,
[16:52.980 --> 16:54.780]  everything that you, when you go to the grocery store,
[16:54.780 --> 16:57.900]  you should have already read about that product before you bought it today,
[16:58.340 --> 17:02.220]  read every bottle and then go. If you don't know what that one ingredient is,
[17:02.220 --> 17:03.740]  if you don't know what spinosad is,
[17:03.780 --> 17:07.020]  if you heard me recommend spinosad to get rid of whiteflies on the show,
[17:07.380 --> 17:09.620]  if you don't know what spinosad is before you spray it,
[17:09.660 --> 17:12.700]  go read what that shit is and understand what you're spraying on your plants.
[17:12.700 --> 17:15.980]  That's your responsibility as a grower. You should have read every bottle.
[17:15.980 --> 17:18.900]  You should have researched everything so that you know what you're putting into
[17:18.900 --> 17:22.660]  yourself and so that you know what you are giving to sick people.
[17:22.940 --> 17:26.540]  And this counts even if it's a commercial or a recreational grow because you
[17:26.540 --> 17:28.540]  don't know where that product is going to end up.
[17:29.180 --> 17:31.140]  You have no idea who's going to be smoking it.
[17:31.180 --> 17:34.020]  You don't want to make more people more sick. All right,
[17:34.300 --> 17:37.340]  let's work on healing people. You guys be more responsible with your gross.
[17:37.340 --> 17:40.900]  Please. That's my point. Big shout out to Kristen Wyatt from the Associated Press.
[17:40.900 --> 17:44.940]  Also much respect to the cannabis for always keeping the good news coming my
[17:44.940 --> 17:47.340]  direction. You guys, it is seven 10.
[17:47.580 --> 17:50.220]  There's some killer thunder rolling through my neighborhood right now.
[17:50.220 --> 17:52.620]  It sounds great. It is finally cooled off.
[17:52.620 --> 17:55.900]  It's been stupid hot here the past few days. It's seven 10.
[17:55.900 --> 17:57.580]  I'm putting myself together a fat dab.
[17:57.580 --> 18:00.140]  I hope you guys are getting a dab together on the count of five.
[18:00.140 --> 18:03.060]  Let's do a dab here together. You guys, one, two, three.
[18:03.060 --> 18:13.880]  Yeah, that's what I needed.
[18:16.800 --> 18:18.200]  Sorry about the silence while I'm dabbing.
[18:18.640 --> 18:23.200]  I hope you guys are dabbing with me. So it wasn't super silent. All right.
[18:23.440 --> 18:26.680]  So I got an email recently. No, this was a Facebook message. No, it was an email.
[18:26.720 --> 18:27.560]  I don't remember.
[18:28.160 --> 18:32.840]  I got a message from somebody who follows me on Facebook and also supports my
[18:32.840 --> 18:36.200]  Periscope because I saw you on Periscope and you reminded me about this question.
[18:36.200 --> 18:37.840]  I appreciate it. Uh, you guys,
[18:37.840 --> 18:40.280]  if you're not on the Periscope app, if you're not checking out Periscope,
[18:40.280 --> 18:43.320]  you should definitely do that. Uh, you can get it on Apple devices.
[18:43.320 --> 18:47.600]  You can get it on Android devices. The Periscope app is fun. You download it.
[18:48.600 --> 18:52.280]  Go follow me. When I come on live, it'll whistle at you.
[18:52.280 --> 18:56.120]  You can open up the screen and you can watch me rant or ramble or take dabs or
[18:56.120 --> 18:58.600]  walk through a grill room or whatever I happen to be doing that day.
[18:59.440 --> 19:01.320]  But the Periscope is a live broadcast.
[19:01.680 --> 19:05.080]  And then the video stays up for 24 hours unless I said something stupid.
[19:05.080 --> 19:08.800]  And then I go delete the whole video, but most of the time I leave it up.
[19:08.800 --> 19:12.040]  So you guys check it out on Periscope. I'm coughing from that dab.
[19:12.040 --> 19:14.080]  I'm going to take a drink and then I'm going to get onto the point to this next
[19:14.080 --> 19:21.230]  topic here. All right. Big shout out to root beer. All right.
[19:21.230 --> 19:24.190]  This next topic is carbon filters. Like I was saying,
[19:24.190 --> 19:27.430]  my friend sent me an email asking about carbon filters. Um,
[19:27.910 --> 19:31.750]  let me start off by saying that, uh, the information that you sent me,
[19:32.150 --> 19:34.430]  you had an idea of which carbon filter you wanted.
[19:35.070 --> 19:36.830]  You have chosen the right filter.
[19:36.910 --> 19:39.030]  That's what I think from the info that you gave me,
[19:39.390 --> 19:42.990]  you were talking about getting the 39 inch tall by, uh,
[19:42.990 --> 19:45.070]  with either an eight or a six inch duct on it.
[19:45.430 --> 19:47.310]  I think that would work perfectly. All right.
[19:48.950 --> 19:50.430]  Lou, that thunder is so sexy.
[19:50.470 --> 19:52.910]  I want to turn off the compression so that you guys can hear the thunder in the
[19:52.910 --> 19:56.670]  background, but I can't get it on there. It's not loud enough.
[19:57.030 --> 20:00.310]  So let's talk about a little bit about selecting the carbon filter. You guys.
[20:00.710 --> 20:03.910]  Um, first of all, I should explain to you what a carbon filter is.
[20:03.950 --> 20:06.670]  Maybe you're new, maybe you're not, uh, familiar.
[20:06.670 --> 20:09.950]  Carbon filter is what we use to take the air, uh,
[20:09.950 --> 20:13.470]  to take the smell out of the air. If the air is leaving your grow room,
[20:13.470 --> 20:16.470]  it's going to stink like crazy. If you have flowering plants,
[20:17.030 --> 20:21.310]  and you have a blower or an inline fan blowing air out of your grow room,
[20:21.790 --> 20:23.590]  uh, cause you have to get that humidity out of there.
[20:23.590 --> 20:25.110]  You got to get that old air out of there.
[20:25.510 --> 20:28.630]  You got to get some fresh air in there. When you're blowing that old air out,
[20:28.630 --> 20:30.750]  it is going to smell like cannabis.
[20:31.110 --> 20:33.910]  It is going to stink like a skunk or fruit or berries.
[20:34.230 --> 20:35.670]  It's going to stink if you're doing it right.
[20:35.670 --> 20:39.870]  So the carbon filter goes on your inline fan, uh,
[20:39.910 --> 20:43.550]  and then it goes out of your facility. It blows air out of the facility.
[20:43.550 --> 20:47.910]  And all the air that passes through the carbon filter will be cleaned. Uh,
[20:48.230 --> 20:50.830]  the carbon filter is a cylinder, uh,
[20:50.830 --> 20:53.870]  with activated charcoal in it and it connects to your inline fan.
[20:54.430 --> 20:58.910]  And then it blows air through there. It goes the carbon filter first,
[20:58.950 --> 21:01.630]  and then you can do inline fan or ducting, however you choose,
[21:01.630 --> 21:05.550]  but then you go out of your grow area and the air that goes through the carbon
[21:05.550 --> 21:08.510]  filter, uh, has all of the contaminants removed.
[21:08.510 --> 21:10.590]  And those contaminants include the odor.
[21:11.510 --> 21:15.470]  So that's basically the stone version of what a carbon filter is.
[21:15.830 --> 21:19.470]  It's a cylinder with activated charcoal that connects to your inline fan.
[21:19.830 --> 21:23.510]  And as the air goes through it, it removes the contaminated air and odors.
[21:24.190 --> 21:27.430]  So now we'll talk a little bit about how to select your carbon filter,
[21:27.910 --> 21:29.790]  because this is the part that our friend needed help with.
[21:29.790 --> 21:34.710]  The goal of your carbon filter and your blower in your room is to exchange the
[21:34.710 --> 21:39.270]  air in your grow room every one to three minutes for best odor control.
[21:39.990 --> 21:43.070]  You guys, what that means is you want to take all of the air out of your room.
[21:43.710 --> 21:45.750]  You don't want to empty it and then refill it. Of course,
[21:45.750 --> 21:50.110]  you want to be sucking air out of the room and refilling every one to three
[21:50.110 --> 21:51.070]  minutes. All right.
[21:51.430 --> 21:55.710]  So you want to get the air completely exchanged every two to three minutes or
[21:55.710 --> 21:58.870]  20 to 30 times an hour ish for best odor control.
[21:59.310 --> 22:04.310]  So to do that, you need to find the cubic volume of the room.
[22:04.710 --> 22:08.630]  To do that, you measure length times width times height. All right.
[22:08.630 --> 22:11.510]  And that will equal the cubic volume of the room.
[22:12.070 --> 22:13.950]  Once you know the cubic volume of your room,
[22:14.070 --> 22:18.630]  then you need to get an inline fan that will pull that volume of air
[22:18.750 --> 22:22.470]  20 to 30 times per hour through your room.
[22:22.910 --> 22:25.190]  And then you'll find a carbon filter that matches that.
[22:25.710 --> 22:28.710]  And that's easy because the, all right, what you need to do,
[22:28.710 --> 22:32.350]  you'll find the cubic volume of the room, right? I'm going to make up a room.
[22:32.870 --> 22:34.830]  Uh, this room is 12 by 12.
[22:35.270 --> 22:38.430]  That's got a 12 by 12 footprint with an eight foot ceiling. Right?
[22:38.710 --> 22:43.750]  So that I did the math that comes out to 1,152
[22:44.310 --> 22:48.310]  cubic feet, or that's the cubic volume of the room. Uh,
[22:48.350 --> 22:50.670]  so you want a blower.
[22:50.750 --> 22:54.590]  Ideally they would pull that would have a CFM rating of
[22:54.590 --> 22:58.310]  1,152 or close to that.
[22:58.910 --> 23:04.150]  Uh, if you go look at the vortex fan, they actually sell one that is an 1140 CFM.
[23:04.590 --> 23:08.990]  So I would use that on either a six or an eight inch duct is what I would
[23:08.990 --> 23:09.830]  recommend.
[23:09.950 --> 23:14.470]  And then you would want to find a carbon filter that is rated for the same amount
[23:14.470 --> 23:16.310]  of CFMs. They come in ranges.
[23:16.430 --> 23:22.350]  So you're going to need a carbon filter that is able to scrub about 1,152
[23:22.630 --> 23:27.590]  cubic feet of volume in your room would be ideal.
[23:27.910 --> 23:32.190]  You can go half of that, which is about 576,
[23:32.790 --> 23:34.590]  but you don't want to go much lower than that.
[23:34.590 --> 23:36.910]  If you went to a third of that,
[23:36.910 --> 23:40.270]  you're looking in the three eighties and you're not going to be pulling enough
[23:40.550 --> 23:44.870]  humidity out that way. Um, and it's, you may get the smell out that way,
[23:44.870 --> 23:47.350]  but you're not going to be cooling the room and you're definitely not going to
[23:47.350 --> 23:48.590]  remove enough humidity and shit.
[23:48.590 --> 23:52.950]  So I would recommend going 575 to like 1,152,
[23:52.950 --> 23:54.630]  maybe a 1200 at the max,
[23:55.110 --> 23:58.710]  but that's how you need to select your blower.
[23:58.710 --> 24:01.590]  A blower is that is going to pull the appropriate amount of air.
[24:02.030 --> 24:04.270]  And then the carbon filter will follow the blower.
[24:04.750 --> 24:07.510]  Make sure you get the right size, uh, flange on there.
[24:07.510 --> 24:10.510]  They come in anywhere from a four all the way up to,
[24:10.510 --> 24:13.790]  I think a 16 is as big as I've seen them. I may have seen an 18.
[24:13.790 --> 24:16.910]  I'm not sure if I've ever seen that one. I've seen that big of one in use,
[24:17.430 --> 24:22.390]  but so once you find your carbon filter that matches your blower,
[24:22.790 --> 24:27.390]  I would recommend that you hang the carbon filter as high as you can in the
[24:27.390 --> 24:32.190]  room, uh, hang it up as high as you can because heat rises. Uh,
[24:32.190 --> 24:35.430]  you want to keep your air conditioner down low and you want to keep your heat.
[24:35.430 --> 24:38.190]  That's up top. You want to suck that out. Uh,
[24:38.230 --> 24:39.870]  make sure you guys change out the carbon filter.
[24:39.870 --> 24:42.750]  Remember they don't last more than a year, maybe two.
[24:42.950 --> 24:46.790]  Some of them are rechargeable, but from what I have found, uh,
[24:47.110 --> 24:50.670]  it's actually much cheaper to just go buy a new one. Uh,
[24:50.670 --> 24:54.070]  the hard part is finding an economical or not an economical and
[24:54.070 --> 24:57.750]  environmentally friendly way to get rid of your old carbon filter.
[24:57.750 --> 24:59.350]  If you guys have any suggestions on that,
[24:59.630 --> 25:02.070]  you can send me an email score from your heart at hotmail.com.
[25:02.390 --> 25:04.430]  I would love to share that information on the show.
[25:04.910 --> 25:08.310]  Get somebody to dispose of their carbon filter more properly.
[25:08.470 --> 25:11.190]  I've got a couple lined up in my garage that I don't know what to do with.
[25:12.150 --> 25:14.070]  All right, you guys, I hope that made sense.
[25:14.110 --> 25:17.750]  That was my very quick lesson on how to select a carbon filter, uh,
[25:17.750 --> 25:21.230]  hang it high. You guys, if you're going to hang a big carbon filter from the roof,
[25:21.270 --> 25:25.510]  from the ceiling, I mean, uh, make sure you do it smartly wisely. God,
[25:25.510 --> 25:27.230]  my grammar is terrible today. Uh,
[25:27.270 --> 25:32.270]  make sure you use a stud and not like a guy like myself or Jesse. Uh,
[25:32.310 --> 25:35.630]  make sure you find a beam in the room. Just do everything smart.
[25:35.630 --> 25:38.750]  Don't destroy the house. Don't hurt yourself, especially hanging a 40 pound,
[25:38.750 --> 25:41.830]  50 pound carbon filter above your head. That shit could fall.
[25:41.870 --> 25:43.910]  I don't want it to break you. I don't want it to break your plants.
[25:43.910 --> 25:46.550]  I love you guys. I would miss you if you quit listening.
[25:47.190 --> 25:50.350]  Definitely hate it if you hurt yourself. So be careful safety first.
[25:50.710 --> 25:51.750]  And since I'm talking about that,
[25:51.950 --> 25:54.150]  here's a piece of advice that I don't talk about often enough.
[25:54.150 --> 25:55.270]  Somebody was like, Hey bro,
[25:55.550 --> 25:59.510]  if you could put like one or two essential pieces of gear in a grow room that I
[25:59.510 --> 26:01.830]  may have overlooked, what would they be? You know what I told him?
[26:02.110 --> 26:05.030]  I said a fire extinguisher on the outside of the room,
[26:05.070 --> 26:08.190]  right outside the door and a smoke alarm inside of the room.
[26:08.670 --> 26:11.670]  I don't share that information enough. That's something I definitely recommend.
[26:11.950 --> 26:15.510]  Put a smoke alarm in there and then put your fire extinguisher outside of the
[26:15.510 --> 26:15.950]  grow room.
[26:15.950 --> 26:18.990]  If it's a residential grow because you don't want to have to run in the grow
[26:18.990 --> 26:21.910]  room to find the fire extinguisher in a worst case scenario,
[26:21.950 --> 26:25.630]  you want it right outside so you can kick open the door and just start spraying.
[26:25.630 --> 26:28.990]  If that's what needs to be done. I hope that never has to happen for you guys,
[26:29.190 --> 26:32.670]  but I hope you do have a fire extinguisher in the case that you do need it.
[26:32.710 --> 26:35.310]  And I hope you had a smoke alarm to give you some heads up.
[26:36.350 --> 26:38.670]  Don't be that guy that burned down your girl. All right, you guys,
[26:38.670 --> 26:40.550]  I feel like I've been going for about 30 minutes here.
[26:40.550 --> 26:43.870]  Let's go click over to the garage man and see how long we've been going.
[26:43.870 --> 26:48.590]  Just about almost 27 minutes. I feel like if I start doing the closing now,
[26:48.590 --> 26:52.110]  we should wrap up right on time for a 30 minute episode. You guys,
[26:52.110 --> 26:54.710]  I really appreciate it. You've been listening to these 30 minutes,
[26:54.950 --> 26:59.230]  30 minute episodes, a whole lot more than you did those 45 an hour long shows.
[26:59.550 --> 27:03.190]  I feel like a lot of you pot smokers have ADD or maybe you just have a short
[27:03.190 --> 27:06.390]  lunch break or something, but I appreciate you guys listening.
[27:06.430 --> 27:09.670]  I can see that you listened to the whole episode and I can see who cuts.
[27:09.670 --> 27:12.310]  I can't see who, but I can see that a lot of the listeners cut out at certain
[27:12.310 --> 27:16.030]  times. So I've learned that about 36 minutes is your attention span.
[27:16.030 --> 27:19.110]  So I try to keep them about 36 minutes, 40 at the most,
[27:19.470 --> 27:21.390]  but I appreciate everybody for listening to you guys.
[27:21.390 --> 27:22.670]  I'm going to start closing up the show.
[27:22.670 --> 27:25.710]  Make sure you check out our sponsors. You guys don't forget about hydro,
[27:25.710 --> 27:28.510]  indoor growing supplies. Definitely love those guys.
[27:28.750 --> 27:31.510]  If you remind them that you listened to the grow from your heart podcast,
[27:31.510 --> 27:34.470]  they will give you commercial pricing on your entire purchase.
[27:34.710 --> 27:37.870]  They've got a lot of great stuff in there. If they don't have what you want,
[27:37.870 --> 27:41.470]  they can definitely order it for you. It'll only take them a few days.
[27:41.470 --> 27:44.390]  They've got another location in Denver. So if you're at the Pueblo shop,
[27:44.670 --> 27:47.230]  if they don't have what you want, they could possibly get it from Denver.
[27:47.230 --> 27:49.870]  If not, they'll get it from the vendor. They'll get it from a distributor.
[27:50.150 --> 27:53.830]  It will be there. It will be fresh. It'll be new. It'll be awesome.
[27:54.430 --> 27:57.750]  So make sure you shop at hydro, indoor growing supplies. Also, you guys,
[27:57.750 --> 28:02.750]  I want to remind you that nature is green remedies.com has changed their name.
[28:03.230 --> 28:07.230]  Their website is now under the dank team.com.
[28:07.390 --> 28:11.430]  The D a N K T E a M.com.
[28:11.590 --> 28:15.630]  The dank team.com. So make sure you check out the dank team.com.
[28:15.990 --> 28:19.350]  Get all your feminized and regular regularized seeds from them.
[28:20.070 --> 28:22.630]  They are most likely sold out of all I read genetics products.
[28:22.630 --> 28:25.590]  They may have some dubwise left, but they don't have much.
[28:25.630 --> 28:28.230]  If they do have anything you guys,
[28:28.230 --> 28:30.790]  if you're interested in sponsoring the podcast, or if you've got a product,
[28:30.790 --> 28:32.710]  you'd like me to review, just send me an email.
[28:32.710 --> 28:34.310]  It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[28:34.590 --> 28:38.070]  I'll get you all the information that you need. Now that the show's over,
[28:38.070 --> 28:41.190]  you guys, please go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[28:41.190 --> 28:44.230]  search for the grow from your heart podcast, find the review section,

[28:49.550 --> 28:51.990]  I will read your comment on a future episode.
[28:52.710 --> 28:54.670]  If you want to leave a comment on stitcher, you can do that,
[28:54.670 --> 28:58.150]  but I do not promise you that I will find it because stitcher likes to change
[28:58.150 --> 29:00.550]  the way comments are left. And it kind of sucks.
[29:00.910 --> 29:03.950]  You can always contact me on Facebook. It's grow from a tag. No,
[29:03.950 --> 29:05.670]  it's just grow from your heart on Facebook, right? Yeah.

[31:35.590 --> 31:39.030]  does for your plants. I will probably have another news article,
[31:39.230 --> 31:43.470]  and then I'll be back in the future with a lot more grow lessons. You guys,

[32:40.120 --> 32:42.080]  She leaves me high.
[32:43.840 --> 32:45.840]  She leaves me dry.
[32:47.560 --> 32:50.560]  But she leaves me so free.
[33:08.880 --> 33:11.400]  River's been good to me.
[33:12.560 --> 33:14.920]  Helped me raise my family.
[33:14.920 --> 33:16.920]  She's going by.
[33:24.920 --> 33:25.920]  Till I die.
[33:27.200 --> 33:29.200]  Watch them snowflakes fly.
[33:31.200 --> 33:33.200]  Sunshine banks of the Arkansas.
[33:38.440 --> 33:40.440]  She leaves me high.
[33:42.200 --> 33:44.200]  She leaves me dry.
[33:45.920 --> 33:47.920]  But she leaves me so free.
[33:50.400 --> 34:06.660]  Down by the Arkansas.
[34:08.660 --> 34:10.660]  Build my house before the snow.
[34:12.660 --> 34:14.660]  Half mile till I die.
[34:23.240 --> 34:25.240]  Watch them snowflakes fly.
[34:27.240 --> 34:29.240]  Sunshine banks of the Arkansas.
[34:33.240 --> 34:35.240]  She leaves me high.
[34:37.240 --> 34:39.240]  She leaves me dry.
[34:41.120 --> 34:43.240]  But she leaves me so free.
