[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World. It's time for episode 407 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.000]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:10.000 --> 00:14.000]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[00:14.000 --> 00:20.000]  and you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.000]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:25.000 --> 00:30.000]  Today, I've been taking dabs of GG4 batter from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.000]  I really love the flavor and aroma of this batter, and I really love the lung expansion from a nice batter.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  This stuff is perfect.
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm excited to be back on the microphone.
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.000]  I haven't recorded an episode in a couple of weeks, so it feels wonderful to be in front of the computer and behind the microphone,
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.000]  and it really feels great to be back.
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  I hope everybody enjoyed those long grow lessons I reposted.
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  I hope we got your garden up in tip-top shape,
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  and I really hope you enjoyed the lesson with Mike and I to top it all off.
[00:59.000 --> 01:02.000]  I had a great time while I was away from the microphone.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  I got to go see Burt Kreischer at the Paramount Theater in Denver.
[01:05.000 --> 01:11.000]  I also got to go visit our friends Scotty Real and Guru from the Dude Grows podcast.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  I was honored to be invited as a guest onto their podcast.
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  By the time this episode comes out, I'm sure you will be able to catch my episode of the Dude Grows show
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  on YouTube, on iTunes, or anywhere you find a respectable podcast.
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  So make sure you give the Dude Grows show a follow.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  I want to give a huge shout out to all of my friends at the Dude Grows show.
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  A big shout out to Scotty, a big shout out to Guru, a big shout out to JR Token,
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  and also a huge shout out, of course, to my friend, the Dude.
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  So thanks again for having me on the Dude Grows show.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  I had a great time on the podcast.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  I had a lot of fun, and I had a really good time hanging out with Scotty Real.
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  So thanks for the hospitality, and I look forward to doing it again.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  Now, since we're talking about the Dude Grows show, let's talk about the Dude Grows Cup.
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  The Dude Grows Cup is coming April 13th at Cultivated Synergy in Denver, Colorado.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  If you are interested in more information about the Dude Grows Cup,
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  please send me an email to growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  I'll make sure to link you up with the Dude, and we will get you all of the info you need
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  about the Dude Grows Cup in Denver in April.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  I look forward to seeing everybody there.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  All right, Podcast World.
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  In this episode, I do plan on reading a couple of listener emails,
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  but before we get there, I owe a couple of my friends a shout out from Patreon.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  How about a big shout out to Richard Goals, a shout out to Richard Memel,
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  and a giant Viking handshake to my friend Grimble the Druid.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  And if you'd like to learn more about becoming a Patreon contributor,
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  all you need to do is go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:43.000 --> 02:44.000]  All right, Podcast World.
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  As promised, it is time to jump into some listener emails.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  I love answering questions from the listeners.
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  If you've got a question for me, you can send it to me at growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  and I will try to work your email into a future episode.
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  The first email on today's episode goes a lot like this.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  Rasta Jeff, I'm a new grower, and your podcast is one of the best I've heard.
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  It is full of specific, practical, and reasonable suggestions for successfully growing the plant.
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  Keep up the good work. Your latest compilations of Grow Lessons are golden.
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  Hey, that is a great way to start an email.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.000]  I love hearing that I'm helping people.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  I love that you love the compilations, and I love that you think I am the best.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  I'm honestly not in competition with anybody, but when you're told the best,
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  it honestly makes all of the work and all of the effort worth it.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  So thank you for starting out with a huge compliment.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  The email continues.
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  He says, I have got one question slash comment.
[03:40.000 --> 03:47.000]  He says, what is the basis for the really hard insistence on having absolutely no light during dark periods and flowering?
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.000]  Then he quotes me by saying, if you can see your hand in front of your face after five minutes in your grow tent when it's dark,
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  then that's too much light.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  And he's absolutely right.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  I do remember saying that, and I still stand behind that statement, and I will explain why in just a second.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  The message continues.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  He says, from an outdoor grow perspective,
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  this would never be the case because of the simple fact of moonlight.
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.000]  All outdoor plants deal with significant moonlight for two or three weeks every month,
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  and a cannabis plant is likely to have at least two cycles of this during early and late fall, right?
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  Outdoor grows don't seem to suffer from this light.
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.000]  So what's the issue?
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  Is this a natural strike against what's possible in an outdoor grow?
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  I'm just curious about this, and I'm very interested in what you think.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  Thanks again for the great and generous podcast.
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  I'm learning a lot, and I trust what you're teaching.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  Hey, thanks for the trust.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  That means a lot to me.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  Now, this is a great question, and I have a really great answer.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  You can tell that my voice is kind of burning out, so I'm going to press pause,
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  and I'm going to get my voice fresh, and I'm going to come back and give you a solid answer on this question.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  You take a dab while I take a drink.
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.000]  All right, podcast world, I am well hydrated, and my voice feels fresh.
[05:01.000 --> 05:08.000]  Let's talk about why our outdoor cannabis plants don't have light interruption problems from the moon.
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.000]  There are several things that contribute to this question.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  The main thing is the sun.
[05:15.000 --> 05:21.000]  When we are growing outdoors, we are growing under the most powerful, most efficient grow light known to man.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000]  That is the sun.
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.000]  This comes into play for a lot of reasons.
[05:26.000 --> 05:34.000]  First off, as the sun sets, the sun puts off a spectrum that is known as a far-red light spectrum.
[05:34.000 --> 05:41.000]  Now, this far-red light spectrum is picked up by our plants by something called phytochrome red.
[05:41.000 --> 05:47.000]  Phytochrome red is a protein that works as kind of a...it has several functions.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  First of all, it is a receptor.
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  The phytochrome red can see that far-red light.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  It knows that it is what receives far-red light.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  It goes, hey, it is my turn to fire up.
[05:57.000 --> 06:01.000]  I'm a phytochrome red little protein, and I see that far-red light.
[06:01.000 --> 06:03.000]  It's my turn to do my job.
[06:03.000 --> 06:11.000]  That phytochrome red protein tells the plant that it is sleepy time, and it makes the plant effectively go to sleep.
[06:11.000 --> 06:13.000]  It turns the plant off for the day.
[06:14.000 --> 06:22.000]  Now, that plant is much less susceptible to light interruptions because the sun put out a far-red spectrum
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  that was received by a protein inside of the plant called phytochrome red.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  The function of that phytochrome red is to start triggering...
[06:32.000 --> 06:37.000]  One of the functions of phytochrome red is to start triggering that plant to go to sleep.
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  It is basically, I guess, a good way to describe it.
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  It is like when you get one of those hypnotists, and when you say,
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  when I snap my fingers, you will fall asleep. Sleep.
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  Phytochrome red, far-red, sleepy time.
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  It's hypnotized. It went to sleep.
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.000]  Then you need the opposite to wake it up in the morning, but we're going to talk about that spectrum in another episode.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  We're trying to focus here on why we don't have light interruptions under the moon.
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  The main contributing factor is the sun.
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  The sun is the brightest grow light we could imagine.
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.000]  We have the sun, the brightest light you could imagine all day long.
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  The sun goes down, it puts out the far-red.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  That far-red is our second contributing factor.
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.000]  The far-red tells the phytochrome red, which is factor number three,
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  that it is time to tuck those plants in, so now they are sleeping.
[07:22.000 --> 07:30.000]  Those three things, that bright-ass light all day, that phytochrome red, and that far-red,
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.000]  are going to put the plants in such a deep sleep that you're going to need a significant light interruption
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  to cause any noticeable problems.
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  Now I've got to wrap that rant up with one of my favorite things to say.
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  Of course, this is very strain-specific.
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  This could be very phenotype-specific.
[07:47.000 --> 07:50.000]  The moon is not going to disrupt your plants.
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.000]  However, a flashlight or some car headlights may disrupt some of your plants.
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  That is where it becomes plant- and strain-specific.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  These plants are under such a powerful light all day long, I mean the sun,
[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  that your flashlight at night probably, and I'm saying probably, will be very insignificant.
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  If you hear something out in the garden and you just shine the flashlight real quick,
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  who's out there? You're probably not going to disrupt the flowering period.
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.000]  Our plants are more sensitive to photoperiod disruption early in flower.
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  So once you get peak flowering time, you don't have as much to worry about.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  Early in flower is where they will be more sensitive.
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  But with this super combination of that powerful light all day,
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  that far-red spectrum telling the plants,
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  hey, you need to go to sleep, and that phytochrome protein within the plant saying,
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  hey, you're right, we do need to go to sleep.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  All of those things working together should tuck your plants in quite nicely.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  Now, don't get me wrong.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  Enough intense light at a long enough duration does have the potential to disrupt
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  your outdoor flowering plants.
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.000]  But it is probably going to take a much more powerful and a much longer duration
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  of light interruption to cause any problems than it would in an indoor environment.
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  In an indoor environment, you don't have the sun.
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  In an indoor environment, you are probably not getting far-red lighting.
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  Some companies have started making red lighting available to the home grower,
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  but it is uncommon. So most folks don't have that at this time.
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  So you're not getting that sun. You're not getting that far-red,
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  which means you are not getting that phytochrome red protein,
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  which is telling your plants to go to sleep.
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  So your plants are kind of napping indoors,
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  and it takes them a little bit longer to actually get to sleep.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  Several times I have been asked,
[09:39.000 --> 09:45.000]  why do my plants go into flower outdoors before we have reached an actual 12-12 cycle?
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  Someone will say, I'm getting 14 hours of daylight,
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  and my plants have started to flower. What's wrong?
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  There are two major contributing factors that decide when your plant flowers outside.
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  The first one is what is known as the critical period.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  Every plant has a critical period.
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  That means how many hours of continued darkness does this plant need before it starts flowering?
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  Now, based on where your plant is from geographically,
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  it will possibly have a different critical photo period flowering time.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  Some places like Alaska don't get much darkness ever.
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  So the plants from Alaska have adapted to flower with less dark time.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  Places like here in Colorado, we get a really nice night cycle.
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  So the plants that are from here have adapted to expect more of a night cycle.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  You'll need to give them more uninterrupted hours of darkness before they will initiate flowering.
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  Most of what modern breeders have bred will flower under a 12-12 condition.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  That's what we have found works best for indoors.
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  If it doesn't work that way, we have probably eliminated it by now,
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  and it's been removed from the gene pool.
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.000]  Of course, there are auto flower plants that will flower under whatever light conditions you put them under
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  because those are bred from those plants that came from the environments that did not get any darkness.
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  So one of the main contributing factors is what is known as the critical period.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  Now, the other thing that is contributing to our outdoor plants flowering with more than 12 hours of daylight time
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  is that far red spectrum.
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  Again, as the sun starts to set, it puts off that far red spectrum.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  The sun is still up. We can still see.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  There's still enough light illuminating the sky to where we can function,
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  but that far red spectrum is telling the plants,
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  hey, I'm starting to activate my phytochrome red protein, and it feels like I want to take a nap.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  So they start putting on their night clothes.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  They start doing whatever. They're drinking their sleepy time tea.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  They're smoking that nighttime joint, and they are getting themselves ready to go to bed,
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  even if there is still a little bit of light out.
[11:45.000 --> 11:53.000]  So that is my long, rambly explanation of why the moon does not cause light interruptions in our outdoor cannabis garden,
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  and I also touched briefly on why our outdoor plants are beginning to flower
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  when there is still more than 12 hours of visible daylight.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  All right, I want to thank you once again for a great email.
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  I'm not sure if you want me to say your name on the show, but you know who you are.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  Thanks for a great message. Thanks for great content.
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  And I look forward to your next question.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  If anybody else out there has a Grow question, I would love to hear from you.
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  My email address is growfromyourheart.com.
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  I've got another email in front of me, and it goes just like this.
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.000]  Rasta Jeff, in advance, I would like to thank you for any advice that you have to give.
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.000]  I have recently installed a mini split system in my small grow.
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  The mini split is overkill, but for my circumstance, it's more stealth than a window unit.
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  Yeah, I understand that completely.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  He also says, I covered the green light display sufficiently, so I thought, and I ran my new seeds.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  My Bodhi seeds did great.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  He got some seeds from Bodhi, who is a great breeder.
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  Big shout out to our friend Bodhi.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  He said those seeds did great.
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  No hermaphrodites.
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.000]  The freebies that came with the Chemkeezy were labeled Diesel Pakistani.
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  One of the Diesel Pakistani hermed on me.
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  You guys, when we say it hermed on him, that means at some point in the flowering phase,
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.000]  that female plant decided to display male parts, which means that that male flower can produce pollen,
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  which can pollinate your female crop, which will put seeds in the whole female crop,
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  which lessens the quality, lessens the potency, lessens the desirability,
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  and kind of ruins the whole project, unless you wanted seeds.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  One of the Diesel Pakistani has become a hermaphrodite.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  This message continues to say,
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.000]  I have always just sat for a few minutes in my dark room to notice the most obvious of light leaks.
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.000]  I take your advice and I hang out in the room for 20 to 30 minutes to ensure there are no obvious light leaks.
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.000]  Is it the green light display leaking through the top of the mini split?
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.000]  Do you think that that super dim green light could have caused the hermaphrodite?
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  Should the whole room have hermaphrodited, or would it be more likely to be an unstable diesel strain?
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  I've got one more Diesel Pakistani to double check in the back corner,
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  and I just can't really get a good look at the lower limbs,
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  so I am unsure if all of the Diesel Pakistani have become hermaphrodites.
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  He wraps up the message by saying, thanks again for the advice, and then he signs his name.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  Now I've got a couple things to say about this message.
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.000]  First of all, that plant that is in the back that you are unable to check, check that.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  Check it soon.
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.000]  That plant quite possibly has hermaphroditic tendencies.
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.000]  It came from a pack that is proven to have hermaphrodite traits, so it is possible.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  It is very likely.
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  Also, the parts that you can't see are where you are very likely to get herm flowers.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  That section that's not getting enough light, that part down there on the bottom,
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  that's where you're going to get a bunch of boy flowers.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  So I recommend you get in there and check immediately.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  Now let's address the actual question.
[14:57.000 --> 15:04.000]  The main question was, do I think the green light leaking from your mini split caused this hermaphrodite issue?
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.000]  No, I do not think the green light was the overall cause of your hermaphrodite.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  I think the hermaphrodite is most likely a genetics issue.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  You said the Bodhi seeds did not have any problems,
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  but that Diesel Pakistani is the one that hermed.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  I would assume that that's where the problem lies is within that Diesel Pakistani.
[15:22.000 --> 15:28.000]  It was also a freebie, so that may be a small indicator of problems just because it was the freebie.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  Now everybody's going to be afraid of the freebies that I give out.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  You guys, those are the same things that I put in packages.
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  I'm just generous and I like to give extra stuff.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  So when you get a freebie from me, it's the same shit that went in the packaging.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  I just put it in a plastic baggie instead of putting an insert in there,
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  and I save myself a buck and you get free seeds.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  So don't be afraid of my freebies.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  Those random freebies that come from vendors,
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  sometimes those are just random freebies for a reason
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  because they want to make it look like you got something,
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  but they're just giving you a seed that's a piece of shit.
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.000]  So be a little weary of that sometimes, unless it's from a reputable breeder.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  I don't know who these Diesel Pakistanis came from, so I shouldn't even talk like that.
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000]  But a lot of times, free stuff is problematic in this industry, and that's unfortunate.
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.000]  So I'm going to say that your problem was probably these Diesel Pakistani seeds.
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.000]  Since the Bodhi stuff didn't harm, I'm not going to blame the issue on that green light.
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  Until recently, it's been believed that plants do not absorb the green light.
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  They are green, so they should, in turn, reflect green light.
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  But there has been some argument recently that the green light does have some use,
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  and it may cause problems.
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  But your green light was very minimal, and I do not think it was the culprit.
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  I'm really going to blame this on questionable genetics.
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  So if you have any more of those Diesel Pakistani seeds,
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  I would probably get rid of them.
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  I would feed those to a bird. I would feed them to a squirrel.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  I just would not grow them.
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  However, I would highly recommend you grow more of the Bodhi seeds.
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  If you have more of those, plant those, grow those.
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  That is good shit.
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.000]  And if you need more seeds, you can get them through OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.000]  They carry Bodhi seeds, they carry Irie genetic seeds,
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  and they've got seeds from all of your favorite breeders.
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  Hey, I want to thank you again for a great email.
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  That was great content, a really great question.
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  That was a fun one to answer.
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  Again, if anybody else out there has an email they would like answered on the show,
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  You know I would love to hear from you.
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's jump into another email.
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  This one is short, and it goes like this.
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  Hi, Rasta Jeff. I hope you are well.
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  I love the podcast. Keep up the great work.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  Hey, thanks for starting out with the great compliment.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  I promise I will keep up the great work.
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  The email goes on to say,
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  Seriously, I do not listen to a lot of podcasts,
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  but I listen to pretty much only your show religiously.
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.000]  Hey, that feels great.
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.000]  Thanks for being a dedicated follower, I think are the correct words for that.
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  Thank you. That means a lot to me.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  So the message goes on, and it says,
[17:54.000 --> 18:00.000]  I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on the pros versus cons of decarboxylation.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  Outside of making cannabinoids active for edibles,
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.000]  I have read that it also makes the flowers stronger for smoking.
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.000]  Is that true?
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.000]  Signed, Jay.
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  And then they say, P.S., long live white Mike.
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  Hey, white Mike, you got a shout out on the show, bro.
[18:18.000 --> 18:21.000]  All right, so let's talk about decarboxylation briefly.
[18:21.000 --> 18:28.000]  Honestly, decarboxylation is not something I am super educated or informed on.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  Decarboxylation is more something done in the edibles game.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  I'm not an edible maker, so I don't have too much practice at this.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  But I do know a little bit about cannabis and about our bodies.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  The goal of decarboxylation, as mentioned earlier in this email,
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  is to actually make the cannabinoids more bioavailable when consumed.
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  The main way decarboxylation happens is through heat.
[18:53.000 --> 18:58.000]  Cannabis flowers and or concentrates can be heated to specific temperatures
[18:58.000 --> 19:02.000]  to activate the cannabinoids for specific effects.
[19:02.000 --> 19:07.000]  Now, I am honestly not educated in the knowledge of decarbing
[19:07.000 --> 19:11.000]  at specific temperatures for desired effects, but I know that that is a thing.
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.000]  Now, decarboxylation happens through heat.
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.000]  So we take cannabis flowers or oils and we heat them to a specific temperature,
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  which makes them more bioavailable.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  A lot of times this would happen in our liver, inside of our bodies,
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  if we ate raw cannabis.
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  By heating it up, we are speeding up that process so that when we eat it,
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  we can get more of the cannabinoids.
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  So decarbing is absolutely useful in an edible product.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  What I think happens is when you are baking the product,
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.000]  I think you are doing a lot of the decarbing during that baking process.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  Now, if you want to eat an oil as just an oil or use it as a mix-in
[19:50.000 --> 19:54.000]  with something else, then it is wise to decarb your oil first.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  So if you're making like a brownie or some cookies or something traditional
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.000]  like that, I do not believe in my opinion that it is necessary to decarb
[20:01.000 --> 20:06.000]  pre-baking. I think the baking will handle that part for you.
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  If you are going to use the oil or butter to make something else and use the
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.000]  butter or oil as a topping and it's not going to get recooked,
[20:14.000 --> 20:18.000]  then you may want to consider the decarbing process before putting the
[20:18.000 --> 20:22.000]  cannabinoids into the fat carrier, which is your oil or your butter.
[20:22.000 --> 20:25.000]  Now, when it comes to decarbing before smoking,
[20:25.000 --> 20:31.000]  that doesn't seem to be necessary to me because what I've mentioned this whole
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  time is that decarboxylation happens mainly through heat.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  And again, this is not my wheelhouse.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  I am nowhere near an expert in this realm.
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.000]  I am talking from my minute amount of experience in this realm,
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  but that decarbing happens through heat.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  When we're smoking, you're putting fire to it.
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.000]  So I think you are basically instantly decarbing it that way.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  You're activating it through fire.
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  So I don't think a decarb is going to make smoked product more potent.
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  Again, I am not an expert in this department.
[21:03.000 --> 21:07.000]  So if somebody would like to email me and correct me, I love corrections.
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  Corrections are a great opportunity to learn something.
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.000]  So feel free, send me an email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[21:13.000 --> 21:17.000]  This is an opportunity for you to educate me and I do appreciate that.
[21:17.000 --> 21:21.000]  So the main portion of this email was asking my opinion on the pros
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  versus cons of decarbing.
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  I absolutely agree with decarbing for making an edible.
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  I don't find it necessary for smoking flowers.
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  All right, this email was wrapped up with the great slogan that says,
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  I can promise you both of those will happen.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  I also want to thank you once again for the great email.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  He also ended that one with PS long live white Mike.
[21:44.000 --> 21:45.000]  That is super cool.
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  Hey Mike, you've got another fan.
[21:47.000 --> 21:48.000]  All right, podcast world.
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  It is time for me to start wrapping up this episode.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  Yes, I know it was a little bit short, but it was super sweet.
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  I feel like I gave you a lot of great information.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  I want to thank everybody once again for all of the great emails.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  I look forward to seeing everybody at the Dude Grows Cup.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  That's right, April 13th at Cultivated Synergy.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  Send me an email if you need more information.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  Also send me an email if you are interested in being a competitor in the
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  Dude Grows Cup, but act fast because there are only 50 spots total available.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  I think 30 of those spots were already taken the last time I spoke with the dude.
