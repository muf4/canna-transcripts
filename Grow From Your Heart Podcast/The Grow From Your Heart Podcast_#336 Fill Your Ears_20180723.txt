[00:00.380 --> 00:03.420]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:03.420 --> 00:06.340]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:06.340 --> 00:09.820]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:09.820 --> 00:11.300]  That's right. If you're a new grower,
[00:11.300 --> 00:12.680]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:12.680 --> 00:14.980]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:14.980 --> 00:17.260]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is
[00:17.260 --> 00:19.500]  just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:19.500 --> 00:22.120]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:22.120 --> 00:24.380]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:24.380 --> 00:26.700]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:26.700 --> 00:29.700]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at
[00:29.700 --> 00:31.180]  the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:31.180 --> 00:33.020]  If you need new genetics for your garden,
[00:33.020 --> 00:35.540]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:35.540 --> 00:38.820]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:38.820 --> 00:41.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
[00:41.400 --> 00:43.980]  pack up the bong, or start heating up that dab rig,
[00:43.980 --> 00:53.530]  because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:53.530 --> 00:55.410]  What's up internet world?
[00:55.410 --> 00:58.570]  It's time for episode 336 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:58.570 --> 01:00.010]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:00.010 --> 01:03.370]  You know I like to start these episodes off by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[01:03.370 --> 01:08.330]  Today I'm taking dabs of the Chem Brûlée full spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[01:08.330 --> 01:09.370]  I love the Chem Brûlée.
[01:09.370 --> 01:12.970]  I think I bought all of the Chem Brûlée they had at my local dispensary.
[01:12.970 --> 01:15.930]  I'm going to have to find a new place to get that or wait for a fresh drop.
[01:15.930 --> 01:18.130]  I went today and they did not have any more.
[01:18.130 --> 01:19.450]  They had plenty of other things to offer,
[01:19.450 --> 01:21.890]  but the Chem Brûlée has been my favorite.
[01:21.890 --> 01:26.410]  It tastes like lemon peels, lime peels, and gasoline.
[01:26.410 --> 01:29.850]  And then there's this after flavor that I can barely figure out what it tastes like,
[01:29.850 --> 01:31.130]  but I really enjoy it.
[01:31.130 --> 01:33.610]  The high is perfect for what I'm looking for today.
[01:33.610 --> 01:37.530]  So the Chem Brûlée full spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs,
[01:37.530 --> 01:39.530]  that's what I'm smoking on.
[01:39.530 --> 01:42.650]  But the best part is I'm smoking out of a brand new rig.
[01:42.650 --> 01:45.130]  Somebody was sweet enough to gift me a brand new rig.
[01:45.130 --> 01:47.930]  It's got a sweet Rasta colored Star of David
[01:47.930 --> 01:51.290]  with a Star of David shaped opal on the back of that.
[01:51.290 --> 01:54.170]  The rig of course has red, yellow, and green line work in it
[01:54.170 --> 01:56.810]  because of course I love the red, yellow, and green work.
[01:56.810 --> 01:59.490]  It is a little banger hanger style rig.
[01:59.490 --> 02:00.530]  It's adorable.
[02:00.530 --> 02:02.690]  This was made by TW Glass.
[02:02.690 --> 02:04.850]  Big shout out to the person who gifted me this rig.
[02:04.850 --> 02:06.570]  They would rather remain anonymous.
[02:06.570 --> 02:08.170]  I truly appreciate it.
[02:08.170 --> 02:09.410]  This is beautiful.
[02:09.410 --> 02:10.770]  This is so me.
[02:10.770 --> 02:13.530]  This is perfectly what I would want for a rig.
[02:13.530 --> 02:14.770]  It's the right size.
[02:14.770 --> 02:17.450]  It is Rasta colored, and it hits like a fucking truck.
[02:17.450 --> 02:18.490]  So thanks a lot.
[02:18.490 --> 02:20.530]  I truly appreciate this gift.
[02:20.530 --> 02:22.610]  So much love and appreciation.
[02:22.610 --> 02:25.050]  Also, big shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass.
[02:25.050 --> 02:28.170]  Today I went to Elevate and I picked up a new banger for this rig.
[02:28.170 --> 02:29.570]  I've got a brand new thermal banger.
[02:29.610 --> 02:30.730]  It's nice and clean.
[02:30.730 --> 02:32.850]  I've been trying to Q-tip it and keep it clean.
[02:32.850 --> 02:36.850]  I also picked up a sexy new red, yellow, and green carb cap.
[02:36.850 --> 02:38.250]  It's got some white in there also,
[02:38.250 --> 02:40.130]  but it matches the rig pretty nicely.
[02:40.130 --> 02:41.810]  I think it looks really good.
[02:41.810 --> 02:42.970]  I also got some butane.
[02:42.970 --> 02:44.050]  I got a new dabber.
[02:44.050 --> 02:46.170]  I got nice and laced up at Elevate Glass.
[02:46.170 --> 02:47.610]  They do not pay me to talk about them.
[02:47.610 --> 02:49.450]  They just took really good care of me today.
[02:49.450 --> 02:50.770]  Big shout out to Mike over there.
[02:50.770 --> 02:51.690]  Big shout out to Becca.
[02:51.690 --> 02:53.570]  Big shout out to all the Elevate dolls.
[02:53.570 --> 02:54.770]  Much love, much respect.
[02:54.770 --> 02:57.050]  Also, big shout out to Mike, White Mike,
[02:57.050 --> 02:58.490]  for riding up with me today.
[02:58.490 --> 03:00.130]  We got Mike out of town, you guys.
[03:00.130 --> 03:01.290]  I kidnapped Mike.
[03:01.290 --> 03:02.490]  I took Mike up to Springs,
[03:02.490 --> 03:04.810]  and we spent most of the day shopping around
[03:04.810 --> 03:05.650]  in Colorado Springs.
[03:05.650 --> 03:06.650]  Hey, Mike, thanks for hanging out, bro.
[03:06.650 --> 03:07.810]  I had a good time with you.
[03:07.810 --> 03:11.130]  We need to get you out of the house more often.
[03:11.130 --> 03:12.530]  All right, what's next?
[03:12.530 --> 03:15.970]  Yesterday, I had the honor of recording a live podcast
[03:15.970 --> 03:18.250]  with the folks from Growing with Fishes.
[03:18.250 --> 03:20.290]  That's right, I was on the Growing with Fishes podcast.
[03:20.290 --> 03:22.330]  It's a live podcast on YouTube.
[03:22.330 --> 03:24.170]  The episode is still available on YouTube
[03:24.170 --> 03:27.210]  if you want to go back and watch my guest appearance.
[03:27.210 --> 03:29.890]  I recommend you just go follow the podcast.
[03:29.890 --> 03:32.090]  Those guys have a great setup going on.
[03:32.090 --> 03:34.410]  There are four or five, maybe five or six dudes
[03:34.410 --> 03:36.890]  that all join together through Google Hangouts,
[03:36.890 --> 03:38.810]  and they go and just talk about cannabis
[03:38.810 --> 03:40.170]  and cannabis growing.
[03:40.170 --> 03:41.470]  They've had a bunch of great guests on.
[03:41.470 --> 03:42.810]  They've had Ed Rosenthal on.
[03:42.810 --> 03:44.770]  They've had Tad Hussey on.
[03:44.770 --> 03:45.970]  I recommend the podcast.
[03:45.970 --> 03:46.930]  I think it's a great show,
[03:46.930 --> 03:49.410]  and the guys are just great dudes to hang out
[03:49.410 --> 03:51.330]  and talk with and listen to.
[03:51.330 --> 03:52.650]  So if you enjoy this show,
[03:52.650 --> 03:55.950]  I recommend the Growing with Fishes podcast.
[03:55.990 --> 03:57.310]  Make sure you check them out.
[03:57.310 --> 03:58.150]  And if nothing else,
[03:58.150 --> 04:00.310]  check out my live appearance on there
[04:00.310 --> 04:01.950]  on their YouTube channel.
[04:01.950 --> 04:03.790]  You guys, I just did a quick little search for you
[04:03.790 --> 04:05.450]  just so that you don't have to do any searching.
[04:05.450 --> 04:07.110]  If you go to YouTube and then search
[04:07.110 --> 04:09.270]  for Growing with Fishes podcast,
[04:09.270 --> 04:11.190]  episode 97, Rasta Jeff,
[04:11.190 --> 04:13.550]  that'll be the quickest way to find the episode I'm on.
[04:13.550 --> 04:15.510]  If you just want to watch random episodes,
[04:15.510 --> 04:17.350]  as soon as you search Growing with Fishes,
[04:17.350 --> 04:20.150]  the first episode that pops up is Tad Hussey.
[04:20.150 --> 04:22.090]  I would just go ahead and listen to that episode.
[04:22.090 --> 04:24.230]  Tad has another great podcast about cannabis.
[04:24.230 --> 04:25.790]  He speaks very well.
[04:26.630 --> 04:28.110]  He knows what he's talking about when it comes to cannabis,
[04:28.110 --> 04:29.250]  and it is a great episode.
[04:29.250 --> 04:31.310]  So that would be a very good introduction
[04:31.310 --> 04:33.630]  if you don't want to start with the Rasta Jeff episode.
[04:33.630 --> 04:35.030]  I understand that.
[04:35.030 --> 04:35.870]  So go check that out.
[04:35.870 --> 04:37.570]  Big shout out once again to my friends
[04:37.570 --> 04:39.310]  at the Growing with Fishes podcast.
[04:39.310 --> 04:40.830]  I think I made six new friends
[04:40.830 --> 04:42.890]  while being on that show yesterday.
[04:43.990 --> 04:46.070]  All right, the next thing on my agenda to talk about
[04:46.070 --> 04:48.790]  is an apology once again.
[04:48.790 --> 04:52.230]  I like to think I put out a pretty high quality podcast.
[04:52.230 --> 04:54.150]  I think I put a lot of work into it personally.
[04:54.150 --> 04:55.470]  I write a lot of notes.
[04:56.150 --> 04:56.990]  I do a lot of thinking.
[04:56.990 --> 04:57.830]  I do a lot of preparation.
[04:57.830 --> 04:59.990]  When the mic comes on, I try to be in a good mood.
[04:59.990 --> 05:01.390]  I try to have a nice flow.
[05:01.390 --> 05:03.510]  I try to put out information that can be absorbed
[05:03.510 --> 05:06.030]  by people that learn from multiple different learning styles.
[05:06.030 --> 05:07.670]  Not everybody learns the same.
[05:07.670 --> 05:09.750]  So I try to teach you two or three different ways.
[05:09.750 --> 05:12.030]  That's why you hear me kind of repeat myself a little bit,
[05:12.030 --> 05:13.470]  but I'm trying to paint the picture
[05:13.470 --> 05:16.110]  so that everybody can visualize what I'm trying to do.
[05:16.110 --> 05:17.870]  I try to be really thorough.
[05:17.870 --> 05:20.750]  I feel like the episode I wrote about building
[05:20.750 --> 05:24.590]  a water system, an automated or assisted watering system,
[05:24.590 --> 05:25.950]  that was a really good episode.
[05:25.950 --> 05:29.150]  There were like seven pages of printed notes.
[05:29.150 --> 05:30.550]  And when it came time to record it,
[05:30.550 --> 05:32.590]  I thought I did a really good job.
[05:32.590 --> 05:34.070]  And then when it came time to edit it,
[05:34.070 --> 05:37.510]  my computer started eating the audio file.
[05:37.510 --> 05:39.550]  I think I have diagnosed the problem.
[05:39.550 --> 05:41.830]  I have unplugged the piece of equipment
[05:41.830 --> 05:43.190]  that I think was giving me shit,
[05:43.190 --> 05:45.750]  and I have replaced it with another piece of equipment.
[05:45.750 --> 05:48.590]  And so far I'm about six minutes into this recording,
[05:48.590 --> 05:51.790]  and I haven't heard a glitch, a pop, a buzz, a hum.
[05:51.790 --> 05:54.270]  I think I've identified the piece of equipment
[05:54.270 --> 05:56.270]  that has gone rogue on me.
[05:56.270 --> 05:57.750]  What I think has gone to shit
[05:57.750 --> 06:01.430]  is my TASCAM US-1200 USB interface,
[06:01.430 --> 06:04.630]  the part that turns my audio signal into a digital signal
[06:04.630 --> 06:06.710]  that lets me shoot it into the computer,
[06:06.710 --> 06:08.510]  that lets me shoot it to the internet.
[06:08.510 --> 06:11.070]  I think that part has taken a crap on me.
[06:11.070 --> 06:12.190]  So I've unplugged that.
[06:12.190 --> 06:14.270]  I've plugged in the Zoom H6,
[06:14.270 --> 06:16.910]  and I'm using the H6 as the interface right now.
[06:16.910 --> 06:18.590]  It sounds good to my ears,
[06:18.590 --> 06:21.390]  and the recording seems to be working smoothly.
[06:21.390 --> 06:23.830]  The software has accepted everything.
[06:23.870 --> 06:25.910]  Honestly, I didn't start seeing problems
[06:25.910 --> 06:28.110]  in the recording last time until about 20 minutes in,
[06:28.110 --> 06:31.150]  so I'm gonna record an episode here with the Zoom H6.
[06:31.150 --> 06:34.750]  This is not going to be a Grow Intensive episode.
[06:34.750 --> 06:36.710]  I'm going to read some iTunes comments
[06:36.710 --> 06:38.270]  and read a couple of emails.
[06:38.270 --> 06:40.590]  That way if something happens with this file,
[06:40.590 --> 06:43.670]  I don't feel like a highly detailed Grow lesson
[06:43.670 --> 06:44.870]  got ruined and wasted,
[06:44.870 --> 06:46.870]  and I don't have to redo that for you.
[06:46.870 --> 06:48.550]  So this all started off with me saying,
[06:48.550 --> 06:50.990]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry for that piece of shit episode
[06:50.990 --> 06:52.630]  that I put out last time.
[06:52.630 --> 06:55.190]  I worked really hard on it, I promise.
[06:55.190 --> 06:57.710]  I think you can tell by what was presented,
[06:57.710 --> 06:59.430]  but the audio file disappeared,
[06:59.430 --> 07:01.130]  and the more I tried to search
[07:01.130 --> 07:02.910]  and figure out what was going on,
[07:02.910 --> 07:06.270]  the more stuff just kept disappearing from GarageBand,
[07:06.270 --> 07:07.550]  and I didn't want to lose more,
[07:07.550 --> 07:09.070]  so I put out what I had.
[07:09.070 --> 07:11.070]  I apologize for the incomplete assignment.
[07:11.070 --> 07:13.710]  I know you guys expect more than that from me,
[07:13.710 --> 07:15.810]  and I know that I'm better than that.
[07:15.810 --> 07:18.270]  I just want to say I was embarrassed to put that out,
[07:18.270 --> 07:19.850]  but I was also frustrated.
[07:19.850 --> 07:21.050]  It was 1.30 in the morning.
[07:21.050 --> 07:22.270]  I was exhausted.
[07:22.910 --> 07:23.750]  I was frustrated.
[07:23.750 --> 07:24.990]  I just wanted to put something out
[07:24.990 --> 07:26.350]  and give up and move forward,
[07:26.350 --> 07:27.590]  so that's what I did.
[07:27.590 --> 07:29.230]  Here we are with the next episode.
[07:29.230 --> 07:30.730]  It sounds good so far.
[07:30.730 --> 07:32.390]  I've given you a solid apology.
[07:32.390 --> 07:33.510]  I hope it doesn't happen again.
[07:33.510 --> 07:36.950]  I can't promise, because I am not a USB device.
[07:36.950 --> 07:39.690]  I can't promise you that I may not just go rogue
[07:39.690 --> 07:43.070]  at some point and start recording in a different bit rate
[07:43.070 --> 07:45.350]  or just start deleting chunks of the file.
[07:45.350 --> 07:46.850]  I can't promise you,
[07:46.850 --> 07:49.430]  but I can promise you that I will do my best
[07:49.430 --> 07:53.710]  to keep bringing you the best quality podcast I can present.
[07:53.710 --> 07:56.550]  You guys, thanks for bearing with me for a crappy podcast.
[07:56.550 --> 07:59.070]  It kind of made me feel bad, to tell you the honest truth.
[07:59.070 --> 08:00.790]  It made me feel guilty.
[08:00.790 --> 08:03.430]  You guys count on me for some shit, and I delivered crap,
[08:03.430 --> 08:04.910]  so I feel like a bad waiter.
[08:04.910 --> 08:07.270]  I feel like a bad host, but I'm recovering.
[08:07.270 --> 08:08.590]  Let's move forward from that crap.
[08:08.590 --> 08:09.630]  I apologize.
[08:09.630 --> 08:11.630]  You guys are all giving me hugs and forgiving me.
[08:11.630 --> 08:12.470]  I appreciate it.
[08:12.470 --> 08:14.310]  Thanks for supporting me.
[08:14.310 --> 08:16.750]  Like I said, I don't want to put out a crazy grow episode
[08:16.750 --> 08:18.630]  in case this recording goes wrong.
[08:18.630 --> 08:21.270]  I think that my Tascam device was the problem.
[08:21.270 --> 08:23.230]  Everything feels really smooth right now.
[08:23.230 --> 08:24.830]  The Zoom H6 is working.
[08:24.830 --> 08:26.510]  I just want to record a couple of episodes
[08:26.510 --> 08:28.990]  before I go super intense on gross stuff,
[08:28.990 --> 08:31.350]  make sure nothing's going to screw up on me again.
[08:31.350 --> 08:34.030]  In fact, I noticed my problems started happening
[08:34.030 --> 08:36.230]  during playback, so what I'm going to do,
[08:36.230 --> 08:37.870]  before I read some iTunes comments,
[08:37.870 --> 08:39.670]  I'm going to press pause.
[08:39.670 --> 08:41.430]  I'm going to play back this part of the show
[08:41.430 --> 08:43.030]  that I've already recorded.
[08:43.030 --> 08:44.070]  I'm going to see how it sounds,
[08:44.070 --> 08:47.070]  make sure everything looks good, sounds good, and feels good.
[08:47.110 --> 08:49.830]  Then if it works well, I'll keep recording.
[08:49.830 --> 08:52.590]  While I'm listening back, I'm going to take a bunch of dabs.
[08:52.590 --> 08:55.110]  I'm going to get lit as shit on this episode.
[08:55.110 --> 08:55.950]  I usually don't do that.
[08:55.950 --> 08:58.310]  I usually don't take a lot of dabs during the show.
[08:58.310 --> 09:00.190]  We're going to see how this goes.
[09:00.190 --> 09:01.510]  We're going to make sure the equipment works.
[09:01.510 --> 09:02.910]  We're going to make sure the new rig works.
[09:02.910 --> 09:04.630]  We're going to make sure the new hash works.
[09:04.630 --> 09:07.070]  We're going to make sure we're just going to have fun.
[09:07.070 --> 09:09.310]  We're not going to go all crazy on this episode, you guys,
[09:09.310 --> 09:10.150]  but please hang out.
[09:10.150 --> 09:11.630]  We'll listen to some iTunes comments.
[09:11.630 --> 09:13.310]  We may read a couple of emails.
[09:13.310 --> 09:14.150]  Hang out with me.
[09:14.150 --> 09:15.350]  I'm going to take some dabs.
[09:15.350 --> 09:16.870]  I'm going to listen back a little bit.
[09:16.910 --> 09:18.590]  I might drop a song in right here.
[09:18.590 --> 09:20.670]  You never know what could happen.
[09:20.670 --> 09:22.470]  I do promise that if you bear with me
[09:22.470 --> 09:24.510]  through a couple of funky episodes,
[09:24.510 --> 09:26.470]  that we're going to get real crazy on Grow Lessons.
[09:26.470 --> 09:28.950]  I've got so much Grow stuff written down
[09:28.950 --> 09:30.750]  that I can't wait to get to it,
[09:30.750 --> 09:32.710]  but I really want to make sure my equipment works
[09:32.710 --> 09:33.750]  before I start doing that.
[09:33.750 --> 09:36.750]  So maybe one or two episodes of just some random stuff,
[09:36.750 --> 09:38.310]  and then we're going to go hard on Grow Lessons.
[09:38.310 --> 09:39.830]  I know you guys love the lessons.
[09:39.830 --> 09:41.270]  A lot of you guys love hanging out.
[09:41.270 --> 09:42.470]  Please bear with me.
[09:42.470 --> 09:44.310]  And also, while I'm thinking about it,
[09:44.310 --> 09:47.190]  big shout out to everybody who supports me on Patreon.
[09:47.190 --> 09:48.870]  Because of the Patreon support,
[09:48.870 --> 09:50.430]  having a broken piece of equipment
[09:50.430 --> 09:52.110]  is not a financial struggle.
[09:52.110 --> 09:53.550]  I can replace this.
[09:53.550 --> 09:55.390]  I need to decide which one I want,
[09:55.390 --> 09:56.350]  and then I can order it.
[09:56.350 --> 09:58.550]  Do I want the Tascam 2-in-2-out,
[09:58.550 --> 10:00.550]  or do I want to get the one that fits in the rack?
[10:00.550 --> 10:02.390]  I'd like another rack-mounted device.
[10:02.390 --> 10:04.710]  Kind of debating if that's necessary.
[10:04.710 --> 10:07.270]  I honestly just use two channels for the USB.
[10:07.270 --> 10:09.950]  I run a Mackie mixer into a compressor.
[10:09.950 --> 10:12.350]  The compressor has a left and right out,
[10:12.350 --> 10:13.590]  and I run that left and right out
[10:13.710 --> 10:17.790]  into channels one and two on my Tascam USB device.
[10:17.790 --> 10:19.710]  So I probably just need the two,
[10:19.710 --> 10:22.110]  but it's not rack-mounted, and that's frustrating to me.
[10:22.110 --> 10:24.430]  I like that it all fits in this nice rack I've got here.
[10:24.430 --> 10:26.030]  Yes, I did say nice rack.
[10:26.030 --> 10:27.990]  You guys, I'm fucking rambly.
[10:27.990 --> 10:29.350]  I am going to press pause.
[10:29.350 --> 10:30.670]  I'm going to take a bunch of dabs.
[10:30.670 --> 10:32.230]  I hope you take some dabs with me.
[10:32.230 --> 10:33.990]  I'm going to listen back to everything I've recorded,
[10:33.990 --> 10:35.230]  make sure it sounds good,
[10:35.230 --> 10:37.190]  and then I'll be right back to keep going with the show.
[10:37.190 --> 10:59.950]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[10:59.950 --> 11:02.990]  I hope you love that funky cowbell groove.
[11:02.990 --> 11:04.310]  You guys, I took a bunch of great dabs.
[11:04.310 --> 11:06.030]  I dabbed some of this Kem Brulee.
[11:06.030 --> 11:07.870]  I also dabbed some of this Soul Cleanser.
[11:07.870 --> 11:10.870]  The Soul Cleanser tastes like Gatorade powder
[11:10.870 --> 11:12.510]  and Windex, kind of.
[11:12.510 --> 11:14.790]  It's delicious and weird all at the same time.
[11:14.790 --> 11:16.070]  I really enjoy that.
[11:16.070 --> 11:18.670]  Took a bunch of dabs, made sure this new rig works.
[11:18.670 --> 11:21.510]  It seems to be passing quality control standards.
[11:21.510 --> 11:24.110]  So far, the part I've recorded sounds pretty good.
[11:24.110 --> 11:25.950]  Other than my voice being in there,
[11:25.950 --> 11:28.390]  the recording works pretty well.
[11:28.390 --> 11:29.670]  Thanks for hanging out with me, you guys.
[11:30.390 --> 11:31.230]  I'm having fun today.
[11:31.230 --> 11:32.070]  I've had a great day.
[11:32.070 --> 11:33.710]  I'm having fun recording with you guys.
[11:33.710 --> 11:36.030]  I hope you were enjoying this weird episode.
[11:36.030 --> 11:37.110]  It's not going to be a normal episode.
[11:37.110 --> 11:37.950]  It feels different to me
[11:37.950 --> 11:39.590]  because I'm recording with different equipment.
[11:39.590 --> 11:41.310]  I'm waiting for something to go wrong.
[11:41.310 --> 11:43.670]  Hopefully nothing does go wrong.
[11:43.670 --> 11:45.950]  To me, it kind of feels like school on a rainy day
[11:45.950 --> 11:47.670]  or like I've got a substitute teacher.
[11:47.670 --> 11:49.750]  I'm just, my eyes are bouncing back and forth
[11:49.750 --> 11:51.990]  from the computer screen to the Zoom H6,
[11:51.990 --> 11:53.550]  to the mixer, to the compressor.
[11:53.550 --> 11:55.230]  I'm just making sure all the correct lights
[11:55.230 --> 11:56.950]  are flashing at the right time.
[11:56.950 --> 11:58.910]  Just kind of making sure the gear works.
[11:58.910 --> 12:00.030]  I will get this dialed in.
[12:00.030 --> 12:02.270]  We're only going to have to do this one more time.
[12:02.270 --> 12:04.270]  When the new replacement piece comes in,
[12:04.270 --> 12:05.590]  I'll have to dial that in.
[12:05.590 --> 12:07.790]  And then we'll have the podcast right back up to speed.
[12:07.790 --> 12:09.350]  We'll get into those killer grow episodes
[12:09.350 --> 12:10.550]  like I've been talking about.
[12:10.550 --> 12:11.510]  Because I'm not bullshitting you.
[12:11.510 --> 12:14.830]  I've got an episode about germinating seeds.
[12:14.830 --> 12:17.670]  I've got an episode about cutting clones.
[12:17.670 --> 12:19.550]  I've got an episode about putting those seeds
[12:19.550 --> 12:21.390]  or clones into soil.
[12:21.390 --> 12:23.390]  I've got an episode about transplanting those
[12:23.390 --> 12:24.790]  once they get larger.
[12:24.790 --> 12:27.830]  I've got an episode about vegetated phase.
[12:27.830 --> 12:29.470]  I'm sure that's enough to let you know
[12:29.470 --> 12:31.590]  I've got a whole bunch of great shit lined up for you.
[12:31.590 --> 12:33.950]  Also, I have an episode planned
[12:33.950 --> 12:36.190]  to talk about seed versus clone.
[12:36.190 --> 12:38.590]  If you're not sure if you want to grow from seeds or clone
[12:38.590 --> 12:40.070]  when you start your fresh garden,
[12:40.070 --> 12:41.710]  I've got an episode all about that.
[12:41.710 --> 12:43.870]  We'll talk about the pros and cons of each.
[12:43.870 --> 12:45.430]  So that's coming up in the future.
[12:45.430 --> 12:47.150]  But let's get the equipment dialed in
[12:47.150 --> 12:50.350]  before we start putting out super intensive grow lessons
[12:50.350 --> 12:51.750]  and then the computer fails
[12:51.750 --> 12:53.830]  and it makes me want to just go crazy.
[12:53.830 --> 12:56.790]  So let's get that dialed in and we'll work on that.
[12:56.790 --> 12:59.910]  In the meantime, let's get to some iTunes
[12:59.910 --> 13:02.430]  customer ratings and reviews.
[13:03.270 --> 13:05.390]  If you'd like to leave a rating and review on iTunes,
[13:05.390 --> 13:06.870]  I would appreciate it.
[13:06.870 --> 13:07.750]  It's really easy.
[13:07.750 --> 13:09.670]  If you're listening through iTunes on your computer
[13:09.670 --> 13:12.170]  or if you're listening on an Apple device,
[13:12.170 --> 13:15.030]  open up the podcast app, find my show.
[13:15.030 --> 13:16.510]  You're probably subscribed to it already.
[13:16.510 --> 13:18.990]  If not, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[13:18.990 --> 13:21.430]  click subscribe, then scroll down
[13:21.430 --> 13:23.110]  where it says available episodes.
[13:23.110 --> 13:24.750]  Keep scrolling past that.
[13:24.750 --> 13:26.510]  It'll show you the ratings and reviews
[13:27.470 --> 13:28.310]  that are already there.
[13:28.310 --> 13:29.510]  Then at the bottom, it will give you the opportunity,
[13:29.510 --> 13:31.150]  it will say write a review.
[13:31.150 --> 13:32.470]  Just click right there.
[13:32.470 --> 13:34.510]  When you click on there, it gives you the opportunity
[13:34.510 --> 13:36.470]  to give one through five stars.
[13:36.470 --> 13:38.550]  Of course, I would appreciate five stars,
[13:38.550 --> 13:40.470]  but give me what you feel I deserve.
[13:40.470 --> 13:42.270]  Be honest, go ahead.
[13:42.270 --> 13:45.030]  Then I would appreciate it if you type in a comment
[13:45.030 --> 13:47.690]  and let me know what you think about the podcast.
[13:47.690 --> 13:49.350]  Again, be honest.
[13:49.350 --> 13:51.270]  That's the only way ratings and reviews work
[13:51.270 --> 13:52.310]  is if you're honest.
[13:52.310 --> 13:53.710]  So go ahead and type in the truth,
[13:53.710 --> 13:55.190]  let us know what you think of the show,
[13:55.230 --> 13:58.990]  and I will read your review on a future episode.
[14:01.030 --> 14:03.430]  Now let's get into some of the reviews
[14:03.430 --> 14:08.430]  we have received through the month of May up till now.
[14:08.430 --> 14:10.550]  Ooh, this review was left on April 26th.
[14:10.550 --> 14:12.550]  I don't remember if we've read this one or not.
[14:12.550 --> 14:14.990]  This is from April 26th of 2018.
[14:14.990 --> 14:18.750]  This review was left by our friend Frankie456,
[14:18.750 --> 14:19.870]  and the review says,
[14:19.870 --> 14:22.590]  I look forward to this podcast every week.
[14:22.590 --> 14:24.050]  Thanks, man.
[14:24.050 --> 14:25.370]  Hey, Frankie, you're welcome.
[14:25.370 --> 14:27.230]  Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[14:27.230 --> 14:28.450]  I appreciate that.
[14:28.450 --> 14:29.890]  I appreciate the support.
[14:29.890 --> 14:32.070]  And twice a week, I'm hoping you're listening
[14:32.070 --> 14:34.110]  to both episodes I put out every week.
[14:34.110 --> 14:34.950]  I put out two now,
[14:34.950 --> 14:37.890]  so please make sure you catch both episodes.
[14:37.890 --> 14:39.130]  Fill your ears.
[14:40.010 --> 14:42.010]  I'm saying weird shit on this episode, but it's good.
[14:42.010 --> 14:43.450]  Fill your ears, that's not bad.
[14:43.450 --> 14:44.690]  I'm not even gonna edit that.
[14:44.690 --> 14:48.050]  Fill your ears with podcast magic, my friend.
[14:48.050 --> 14:49.850]  All right, this review was left on May 7th
[14:49.850 --> 14:52.970]  by a person who calls themselves MadcapV2.
[14:52.970 --> 14:56.210]  MadcapV2's review has a headline that says,
[14:56.210 --> 14:57.250]  great vibe.
[14:57.250 --> 14:59.610]  Of course, he left us five stars,
[14:59.610 --> 15:01.930]  and the review goes like this.
[15:01.930 --> 15:04.130]  I've been listening for about a month.
[15:04.130 --> 15:05.290]  I love the show.
[15:05.290 --> 15:07.050]  I would enjoy more strain reviews.
[15:07.050 --> 15:07.890]  Keep it up.
[15:07.890 --> 15:10.690]  Really makes my Monday morning drives a lot better.
[15:10.690 --> 15:12.370]  Thank you, Jeff.
[15:12.370 --> 15:14.390]  Hey, Madcap, thank you for the great review,
[15:14.390 --> 15:15.710]  and thank you for listening.
[15:15.710 --> 15:16.550]  And once again,
[15:16.550 --> 15:18.370]  I hope you guys are listening to the Thursday episodes.
[15:18.370 --> 15:20.650]  I'm putting out shows on Mondays and Thursday.
[15:20.650 --> 15:21.970]  I hope you're catching those.
[15:21.970 --> 15:23.690]  So you say you've only been listening for about a month.
[15:23.690 --> 15:25.470]  Hopefully by now you've been listening
[15:25.470 --> 15:26.310]  for two or three months.
[15:26.310 --> 15:27.450]  This was left in May.
[15:27.450 --> 15:28.930]  We're all the way up to July now.
[15:28.930 --> 15:30.010]  Hopefully you've caught on.
[15:30.010 --> 15:32.090]  There is a Monday and Thursday episode.
[15:32.090 --> 15:33.370]  Please listen.
[15:33.370 --> 15:35.890]  Once again, fill your ears.
[15:35.890 --> 15:37.050]  That's gonna be a new thing, you guys.
[15:37.050 --> 15:39.770]  Hashtag fill your ears.
[15:39.770 --> 15:40.610]  All right, I've got another.
[15:40.610 --> 15:41.650]  Hey, dude, thanks for the great review.
[15:41.650 --> 15:42.930]  I've got another review on the screen
[15:42.930 --> 15:45.450]  if the iPad will cooperate here.
[15:45.450 --> 15:48.550]  This one also was left on May 7th of 2018
[15:48.550 --> 15:51.810]  by a person who calls themselves RedhouseGroves.
[15:52.650 --> 15:54.050]  And their headline of the review is Awesome Podcast.
[15:54.050 --> 15:56.170]  Of course, they left five stars.
[15:56.170 --> 15:59.010]  The review goes like this.
[15:59.010 --> 16:00.090]  I love the podcast.
[16:00.090 --> 16:01.730]  I'm currently at episode 250
[16:01.730 --> 16:04.690]  and catching all the way up at four to 12 hours a day
[16:04.690 --> 16:07.350]  of listening to your show and the Dude Groves shows.
[16:07.350 --> 16:08.610]  Keeps my sanity at work.
[16:08.610 --> 16:12.390]  And for that, I thank you, Ross DeGeff from Redhouse Groves.
[16:13.290 --> 16:17.110]  Hey, Redhouse, man, I keep your sanity.
[16:17.110 --> 16:18.550]  I help you keep your sanity.
[16:18.550 --> 16:21.330]  You listen to me for four hours to 12 hours a day
[16:21.850 --> 16:22.690]  and it helps keep your sanity.
[16:22.690 --> 16:26.770]  I'm not sure that what you've got qualifies as sanity
[16:26.770 --> 16:31.410]  if my voice for four to 12 hours a day keeps you sane.
[16:31.410 --> 16:32.990]  No, dude, honestly, I do appreciate it.
[16:32.990 --> 16:34.590]  Thanks, that's a lot of listening to me.
[16:34.590 --> 16:36.770]  I hope you've caught up with all of the episodes by now.
[16:36.770 --> 16:39.590]  If you're listening to four to 12 hours of us a day,
[16:39.590 --> 16:42.250]  you're probably getting pretty close to caught up.
[16:42.250 --> 16:44.630]  I'm curious if you just listen to the 100 episodes
[16:44.630 --> 16:46.150]  that are available in the feed
[16:46.150 --> 16:48.130]  or if you've gone all the way back to YouTube
[16:48.130 --> 16:50.130]  and started at episode one.
[16:50.130 --> 16:52.290]  Episode one is available on a playlist
[16:52.290 --> 16:54.970]  that is on the Grow From Your Heart podcast channel.
[16:54.970 --> 16:56.690]  One through 20 are on a playlist,
[16:56.690 --> 17:01.210]  then 21 through current are on my YouTube channel.
[17:01.210 --> 17:03.630]  So if you wanna go listen to everything, it's there.
[17:03.630 --> 17:05.330]  It may seem weird because back in the day,
[17:05.330 --> 17:07.890]  the show was called the iGrow Culture Podcast.
[17:07.890 --> 17:11.050]  I came to find out that iGrow Culture is already taken.
[17:11.050 --> 17:15.410]  That is the name of an educational institution.
[17:15.410 --> 17:19.170]  They teach about agriculture on the college level
[17:19.170 --> 17:20.930]  over the internet, go figure, right?
[17:20.930 --> 17:21.850]  I thought it was original.
[17:21.850 --> 17:22.990]  I wasn't trying to steal a name,
[17:22.990 --> 17:24.410]  but as soon as they told me that name was taken,
[17:24.410 --> 17:26.770]  I changed my name to the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[17:26.770 --> 17:28.170]  Much more appropriate.
[17:28.170 --> 17:30.250]  Anyway, I hope you're listening to the old stuff.
[17:30.250 --> 17:33.090]  Dude, seriously, thanks for listening.
[17:33.090 --> 17:34.050]  Thanks for catching up.
[17:34.050 --> 17:35.850]  I hope we really are making your day better.
[17:35.850 --> 17:37.370]  And also thanks for supporting my friends,
[17:37.370 --> 17:38.210]  the Dude Grows Show.
[17:38.210 --> 17:40.010]  If you guys aren't listening to the Dude Grows,
[17:40.010 --> 17:41.010]  you should check that out.
[17:41.010 --> 17:41.970]  They're friends of mine.
[17:41.970 --> 17:44.130]  It's another great cannabis podcast.
[17:44.130 --> 17:46.170]  I feel like we should be listening and supporting
[17:46.170 --> 17:47.810]  all of the cannabis podcasts
[17:47.810 --> 17:50.010]  because we're all out to do the same thing.
[17:50.010 --> 17:51.690]  There's no competition in my mind.
[17:51.690 --> 17:53.410]  It's all the same goal.
[17:53.410 --> 17:55.330]  So let's all support each other.
[17:55.330 --> 17:56.930]  You guys, I am rambling today.
[17:56.930 --> 17:59.810]  I hope you're having as much fun as I am with this podcast.
[17:59.810 --> 18:02.070]  Hey, Red House Grows, thanks for a great review.
[18:02.070 --> 18:03.650]  Thanks for the five stars.
[18:03.650 --> 18:04.970]  Gonna move forward.
[18:04.970 --> 18:07.730]  This review comes from our friend Nannerboy.
[18:07.730 --> 18:09.050]  What's up, Nannerboy?
[18:09.050 --> 18:12.190]  I can't see the headline because the review is short.
[18:12.190 --> 18:13.510]  There's no button to press more,
[18:13.510 --> 18:15.370]  but I can see that there is a headline
[18:15.370 --> 18:16.690]  and I think it says, thank you.
[18:16.690 --> 18:17.930]  I can see than.
[18:17.930 --> 18:19.570]  I'm gonna hope that's the start of thank you.
[18:19.570 --> 18:22.770]  If I typed in than, my autocorrect would say thank you
[18:22.770 --> 18:24.330]  or happy Thanksgiving.
[18:24.330 --> 18:27.290]  But this came in May, so I'm going to assume
[18:27.290 --> 18:28.770]  it says thank you.
[18:28.770 --> 18:31.810]  Anyway, it's from May 31st from Nannerboy
[18:31.810 --> 18:34.170]  and it says, met you at the DGC cup.
[18:34.170 --> 18:35.890]  Thanks for hanging.
[18:35.890 --> 18:37.830]  I just mentioned my friends at the DGC cup,
[18:37.830 --> 18:39.130]  the Dude Grows crew.
[18:39.130 --> 18:41.090]  Ah man, I had a good time hanging out with Nannerboy.
[18:41.090 --> 18:42.350]  I remember you guys.
[18:42.350 --> 18:43.730]  I hope you guys had a safe trip
[18:43.730 --> 18:48.410]  and I look forward to seeing you at the next Dude Grows cup
[18:48.410 --> 18:50.090]  if that's a thing that happens this year.
[18:50.090 --> 18:52.130]  Big shout out to both my friends,
[18:52.130 --> 18:55.130]  all three of my friends, the Dude, Scotty, and Guru.
[18:55.130 --> 18:56.430]  Hope everybody's well.
[18:56.430 --> 18:57.930]  The Dude has moved to Canada.
[18:57.930 --> 18:59.570]  Scotty's having some health issues
[18:59.570 --> 19:01.570]  and the Guru is holding it down.
[19:01.570 --> 19:03.250]  So big shout out to all three of them.
[19:03.250 --> 19:04.490]  I hope they're all doing well.
[19:04.490 --> 19:06.970]  I hope Dude's move is going well.
[19:06.970 --> 19:08.490]  I hope the transition is happening well.
[19:08.490 --> 19:10.170]  I hope Scotty's coming along with the health
[19:10.170 --> 19:11.890]  and the Guru, man, keep killing it, bro.
[19:11.890 --> 19:12.730]  I love what you do.
[19:12.730 --> 19:14.770]  Super smart, always on top of your shit.
[19:14.770 --> 19:17.290]  I love it when you step in and shine some light
[19:17.290 --> 19:19.530]  on subjects that the boys are just way in the dark in.
[19:19.530 --> 19:20.410]  That's my favorite.
[19:20.410 --> 19:22.050]  So shout out to those guys.
[19:22.050 --> 19:24.050]  I should keep going with these reviews.
[19:24.050 --> 19:27.110]  Told you guys, I got high on rambly, so have fun with me.
[19:28.090 --> 19:30.450]  So far, nothing has gone wrong with the recording equipment.
[19:30.450 --> 19:32.050]  I keep looking at everything and I'm happy.
[19:32.050 --> 19:34.930]  We're almost 20 minutes in and nothing has caught on fire.
[19:34.930 --> 19:36.890]  No springs have flown out like it does on the cartoons.
[19:36.890 --> 19:38.530]  How come when something breaks on the cartoons,
[19:38.530 --> 19:39.370]  springs fly out?
[19:39.370 --> 19:41.730]  It was boing and springs and sprockets fly out.
[19:41.730 --> 19:43.570]  It could be a computer, it could be anything.
[19:43.570 --> 19:45.690]  It could be somebody's heart and springs fly out.
[19:45.690 --> 19:47.290]  I think it's so fucking funny.
[19:47.290 --> 19:48.610]  All right, let's keep going.
[19:48.610 --> 19:50.730]  This one was left on June 17th
[19:50.730 --> 19:53.410]  from somebody who calls themselves Mateo505.
[19:53.410 --> 19:55.250]  I'm gonna guess that's one of our Albuquerque friends.
[19:55.250 --> 19:57.210]  Big shout out to our New Mexico friends.
[19:57.210 --> 19:59.570]  This review says, Rasta Jeff is the jefe.
[19:59.570 --> 20:01.370]  That means I'm the boss.
[20:01.370 --> 20:02.390]  He gave us five stars.
[20:02.390 --> 20:03.410]  The review goes like this.
[20:03.410 --> 20:04.770]  Rasta Jeff is the man.
[20:04.770 --> 20:08.230]  I look forward to the knowledge he freely shares every week
[20:08.230 --> 20:11.990]  and goes into detail instead of skimming over subjects.
[20:11.990 --> 20:14.190]  Keep up the good work.
[20:14.190 --> 20:15.710]  There's a lot of stuff in there.
[20:15.710 --> 20:17.690]  He looks forward to the knowledge I freely share.
[20:17.690 --> 20:18.990]  Yes, it is free.
[20:18.990 --> 20:21.790]  I do ask for Patreon contributions,
[20:21.790 --> 20:23.150]  but that is if you're able to.
[20:23.150 --> 20:25.530]  If you're able to throw down on Patreon, please do that.
[20:25.530 --> 20:27.830]  It's patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[20:27.830 --> 20:29.190]  You're not required to do so.
[20:29.190 --> 20:30.770]  I appreciate the folks who do.
[20:30.770 --> 20:32.750]  The people who have been contributing to Patreon
[20:32.750 --> 20:34.710]  upgraded the MacBook Pro I'm using.
[20:34.710 --> 20:36.670]  The people who contributed to Patreon
[20:36.670 --> 20:39.150]  are going to be the people I have to say thank you to
[20:39.150 --> 20:41.110]  when I replace my Tascam device.
[20:41.110 --> 20:43.390]  Patreon has been very kind to me.
[20:43.390 --> 20:44.990]  You're not required to pay for this podcast.
[20:44.990 --> 20:45.830]  It's free.
[20:45.830 --> 20:47.530]  I want to put this out because I love recording.
[20:47.530 --> 20:48.510]  I love cannabis.
[20:48.510 --> 20:49.450]  I love you guys.
[20:49.450 --> 20:51.070]  And I think it's kind of my duty.
[20:51.070 --> 20:54.190]  I know it sounds weird, but we're all put here for something
[20:54.190 --> 20:55.830]  and I've got a few solid purposes
[20:55.830 --> 20:58.110]  that I know I'm meant to be doing.
[20:58.110 --> 21:00.590]  And this is something that I know,
[21:00.590 --> 21:02.590]  like if they came to something,
[21:02.590 --> 21:03.670]  if whoever you believe in,
[21:03.670 --> 21:05.030]  you guys know what I believe in.
[21:05.030 --> 21:06.310]  My name is Rasta Jeff.
[21:06.950 --> 21:07.790]  If Ja came to me and said,
[21:07.790 --> 21:09.590]  you can only pick five things,
[21:09.590 --> 21:12.790]  recording this podcast would be one of the five things
[21:12.790 --> 21:14.790]  I know I'm supposed to be doing.
[21:14.790 --> 21:16.910]  I wouldn't cut this out because I know it's right.
[21:16.910 --> 21:19.570]  Anyway, I'm fucking rambling you guys.
[21:19.570 --> 21:20.710]  Sharing the knowledge freely.
[21:20.710 --> 21:23.030]  That's because I feel like it's my gift
[21:23.030 --> 21:24.870]  that I need to give back to you guys
[21:24.870 --> 21:26.070]  to the cannabis community.
[21:26.070 --> 21:27.870]  The cannabis plant and the cannabis community
[21:27.870 --> 21:30.870]  has been super kind to me and super generous to me.
[21:30.870 --> 21:33.070]  So I just turn that back around
[21:33.070 --> 21:34.430]  and just put that right back out
[21:34.470 --> 21:36.470]  as what I feel like I'm doing.
[21:36.470 --> 21:39.470]  Also, he says, I go into detail
[21:39.470 --> 21:41.430]  instead of skimming over subjects.
[21:41.430 --> 21:43.670]  I do kind of pick one subject
[21:43.670 --> 21:46.130]  and beat the shit out of it for an entire episode.
[21:46.130 --> 21:47.710]  But like I said earlier,
[21:47.710 --> 21:50.450]  people don't all learn from the same thing,
[21:50.450 --> 21:51.730]  the same type of teaching.
[21:51.730 --> 21:52.570]  That's why in school,
[21:52.570 --> 21:53.910]  the teacher used to bore the shit out of me
[21:53.910 --> 21:55.930]  because she would teach five different ways
[21:55.930 --> 21:57.990]  and I caught on the first way.
[21:57.990 --> 22:00.070]  I'm sure there were kids that that first,
[22:00.070 --> 22:01.510]  the way she taught, that didn't click.
[22:01.510 --> 22:03.070]  She had to teach it the second way.
[22:03.110 --> 22:04.990]  There were probably some kids wearing Velcro shoes
[22:04.990 --> 22:06.630]  that needed the third teaching.
[22:06.630 --> 22:09.610]  I just want to make sure that everybody can figure it out.
[22:09.610 --> 22:11.990]  We all don't have, some of us think in cartoon,
[22:11.990 --> 22:14.430]  some of us think with fucking graph paper in our brain.
[22:14.430 --> 22:16.310]  Some of us can think in AutoCAD.
[22:16.310 --> 22:18.990]  I just want to make sure that the people thinking in crayons,
[22:18.990 --> 22:20.710]  the people thinking in AutoCAD,
[22:20.710 --> 22:22.550]  the people that have done this a thousand times,
[22:22.550 --> 22:24.950]  I want to make sure everybody feels included in the show.
[22:24.950 --> 22:26.310]  I don't want to lose anybody.
[22:26.310 --> 22:28.550]  I want the, if this is your first grow,
[22:28.550 --> 22:29.910]  I want this to make sense to you.
[22:29.910 --> 22:33.150]  If you've been growing commercially for a hundred years
[22:33.150 --> 22:34.750]  and you've done it all,
[22:34.750 --> 22:36.310]  I still want this show to be entertaining to you.
[22:36.310 --> 22:38.670]  So that's why I hit things at different angles.
[22:38.670 --> 22:41.250]  And a lot of the other shows just skim right over stuff.
[22:41.250 --> 22:43.310]  They'll be like, what's the best kind of light?
[22:43.310 --> 22:44.230]  I like HBSs.
[22:44.230 --> 22:45.230]  Okay, let's move forward.
[22:45.230 --> 22:47.330]  And I'm like, ah, there were so many things
[22:47.330 --> 22:49.010]  you fucking skipped right over.
[22:49.010 --> 22:52.430]  And I'm good at finding those things and documenting them
[22:52.430 --> 22:54.070]  and making sure you guys don't miss details.
[22:54.070 --> 22:55.630]  So thanks for noticing that.
[22:55.630 --> 22:57.310]  Then he goes on to say, keep up the good work.
[22:57.310 --> 22:59.270]  Hey man, keep listening
[22:59.270 --> 23:01.750]  and keep growing quality cannabis for me.
[23:01.750 --> 23:04.310]  And I will keep putting out the best podcast I can.
[23:05.310 --> 23:07.750]  Yo, Matteo505, thank you for the great review.
[23:07.750 --> 23:09.470]  Thank you for the five stars
[23:09.470 --> 23:11.610]  and thanks for noticing the hard work, brother.
[23:11.610 --> 23:12.450]  I appreciate that.
[23:12.450 --> 23:13.870]  And keep repping the 505 down there.
[23:13.870 --> 23:16.490]  I hope you're hanging out with our friends from Organica.
[23:16.490 --> 23:19.490]  All right, I've got one more iTunes customer review.
[23:19.490 --> 23:21.470]  This one was left on July 3rd.
[23:21.470 --> 23:23.710]  This one was from my friend Juanzilla.
[23:23.710 --> 23:24.670]  What's up, Juanzilla?
[23:24.670 --> 23:26.970]  Juan comes and hangs out in my Instagram live feeds
[23:27.630 --> 23:28.470]  quite often.
[23:28.470 --> 23:29.290]  We interact quite a bit.
[23:29.290 --> 23:30.130]  Juan's a cool person.
[23:30.130 --> 23:31.450]  I like Juan's personality.
[23:31.450 --> 23:32.730]  He's a great dude.
[23:32.730 --> 23:35.490]  He left a five star rating, of course.
[23:35.490 --> 23:37.730]  The headline is, such a great tip.
[23:37.730 --> 23:40.490]  He says, if you are even curious about the work
[23:40.490 --> 23:43.090]  that goes into growing, listen to Jeff explain everything,
[23:43.090 --> 23:45.290]  ranging from light cycles to phenos
[23:45.290 --> 23:47.550]  and everything else in between.
[23:47.550 --> 23:49.450]  Mike, who is a regular guest,
[23:49.450 --> 23:52.430]  is always a great addition to any episode.
[23:52.430 --> 23:54.850]  Hey, that's a really cool review of my show.
[23:54.850 --> 23:56.410]  I appreciate that.
[23:56.770 --> 23:57.610]  That's inviting.
[23:57.610 --> 23:58.730]  That makes people want to listen to the show.
[23:58.730 --> 24:01.050]  If you're even curious about the work
[24:01.050 --> 24:02.970]  that goes into growing, listen to Jeff.
[24:02.970 --> 24:04.570]  That means that you trust me
[24:04.570 --> 24:06.110]  that I can tell you what's going on.
[24:06.110 --> 24:07.410]  That you know I've done it enough
[24:07.410 --> 24:08.970]  and I figured out how to word it properly.
[24:08.970 --> 24:11.050]  That you trust me to explain it to the new folks,
[24:11.050 --> 24:11.890]  which is my goal.
[24:11.890 --> 24:12.710]  So thank you.
[24:13.690 --> 24:16.170]  Explain everything from light cycles to phenos
[24:16.170 --> 24:17.370]  to everything else in between.
[24:17.370 --> 24:18.930]  That is pretty cool because light cycles
[24:18.930 --> 24:20.870]  is like the first shit you need to figure out.
[24:20.870 --> 24:22.930]  And then phenos is like some advanced stuff.
[24:22.930 --> 24:25.630]  So you've highlighted that we're doing it all.
[24:26.150 --> 24:27.990]  And then everything in between, that covers it all.
[24:27.990 --> 24:30.030]  And then you shout out White Mike.
[24:30.030 --> 24:31.670]  White Mike and I had a lot of fun today.
[24:31.670 --> 24:33.190]  So it's cool that you acknowledge
[24:33.190 --> 24:36.230]  that Mike is a regular guest and always a great addition.
[24:36.230 --> 24:38.110]  Mike likes to get us rambling and talkative
[24:38.110 --> 24:40.330]  and he opens up a whole new point of view
[24:40.330 --> 24:43.210]  and a whole new perspective on the way that things are done.
[24:43.210 --> 24:44.750]  So I appreciate having Mike on here
[24:44.750 --> 24:46.350]  and it sounds like you guys do too.
[24:46.350 --> 24:48.190]  So hey Juan, thank you for the great review.
[24:48.190 --> 24:49.230]  Man, thanks for the loyalty.
[24:49.230 --> 24:50.550]  Thanks for listening to the show.
[24:50.550 --> 24:51.950]  Thanks for the five stars.
[24:51.950 --> 24:53.750]  And thanks for hanging out, man.
[24:53.750 --> 24:55.630]  You guys, I mentioned the Instagram live feed
[24:55.630 --> 24:56.750]  where Juan hangs out.
[24:56.750 --> 24:58.710]  If you wanna follow my Instagram live,
[24:58.710 --> 25:00.470]  I answer live questions right there
[25:00.470 --> 25:01.830]  on the Instagram live feed.
[25:01.830 --> 25:03.790]  You can type in a question, I'll read it.
[25:03.790 --> 25:06.070]  And then if I know the answer off the top of my head,
[25:06.070 --> 25:07.950]  I will give you my best answer.
[25:07.950 --> 25:09.430]  Sometimes, honestly, I don't know things.
[25:09.430 --> 25:10.670]  There are things that I haven't studied.
[25:10.670 --> 25:12.090]  There are things that I haven't researched.
[25:12.090 --> 25:13.430]  Sometimes I'll say, I don't remember.
[25:13.430 --> 25:14.910]  Ask me that in a couple of days
[25:14.910 --> 25:15.910]  and I'll try to read about it
[25:15.910 --> 25:17.270]  and then I'll hit you back with it.
[25:17.270 --> 25:18.950]  But if you follow me on Instagram,
[25:18.950 --> 25:20.830]  it's iry underscore genetics,
[25:20.830 --> 25:23.390]  I-R-I-E underscore genetics on Instagram.
[25:24.030 --> 25:25.390]  So give me a follow, turn on your notifications.
[25:25.390 --> 25:26.710]  When I go live, your phone will ding.
[25:26.710 --> 25:27.790]  You'll be able to open it up.
[25:27.790 --> 25:29.350]  You'll get to watch me go live.
[25:29.350 --> 25:31.390]  I just hang out, I chat, I ramble.
[25:31.390 --> 25:32.790]  I'm really interactive with the audience.
[25:32.790 --> 25:34.590]  I take dabs, I answer grow questions.
[25:34.590 --> 25:36.070]  Sometimes we just get real goofy
[25:36.070 --> 25:37.630]  and hang out and have a good time.
[25:37.630 --> 25:39.270]  But I think you would enjoy it.
[25:39.270 --> 25:41.430]  If you like the podcast, you would like the live feed.
[25:41.430 --> 25:42.750]  It's a little less formal.
[25:42.750 --> 25:44.290]  We kind of bullshit a little bit.
[25:44.290 --> 25:45.830]  I get super stoned on there.
[25:45.830 --> 25:48.350]  There's no editing so you can see what's really going on.
[25:48.350 --> 25:49.750]  I think it's a lot of fun.
[25:49.750 --> 25:51.990]  Anyway, Juanzilla, shout out.
[25:51.990 --> 25:53.510]  Also, big shout out to everybody
[25:53.510 --> 25:57.190]  who left a rating and review today and in the past.
[25:57.190 --> 25:58.030]  I appreciate it.
[25:58.030 --> 26:00.030]  That helps us out on iTunes.
[26:00.030 --> 26:02.390]  And if you haven't left a rating or a review yet,
[26:02.390 --> 26:04.790]  I would appreciate it if you head right over to iTunes,
[26:04.790 --> 26:05.970]  type in a little review,
[26:05.970 --> 26:07.710]  let me know what you think about the show.
[26:07.710 --> 26:10.250]  I would love to hear from you.
[26:10.250 --> 26:12.230]  All right, you guys, the show is creeping up on 30 minutes.
[26:12.230 --> 26:13.270]  We're at 26 minutes here.
[26:13.270 --> 26:15.630]  We have not had any technical difficulties.
[26:15.630 --> 26:18.070]  I've noticed that the previous issues would happen
[26:18.070 --> 26:19.430]  when I would stop the recording
[26:19.430 --> 26:21.950]  and go back and record over a messed up track.
[26:22.790 --> 26:23.790]  I've done that a couple of times on purpose now
[26:23.790 --> 26:25.910]  just to kind of mess with the recording software
[26:25.910 --> 26:27.790]  and see if that was where the issue lies.
[26:27.790 --> 26:29.990]  The issue does not seem to be within the computer.
[26:29.990 --> 26:33.890]  The issue, I'm 90% certain, was with this Tascam device.
[26:33.890 --> 26:35.750]  So I'm going to replace that.
[26:35.750 --> 26:39.070]  I think everything should be just fine.
[26:39.070 --> 26:39.890]  I'm not sure why.
[26:39.890 --> 26:42.470]  I feel like I have to tell you about all of my tech issues,
[26:42.470 --> 26:44.750]  but now we're on the same page together
[26:44.750 --> 26:46.550]  and we're all friends.
[26:46.550 --> 26:47.390]  All right, you guys,
[26:47.390 --> 26:48.830]  before I start wrapping up this podcast,
[26:48.830 --> 26:50.230]  let's talk a little bit about
[26:50.310 --> 26:52.310]  my most recent breeding project.
[26:52.310 --> 26:53.310]  A lot of times I come on here
[26:53.310 --> 26:56.270]  and I share what I'm working on in my garden.
[26:56.270 --> 26:58.230]  Recently, I decided to make more
[26:58.230 --> 26:59.970]  Lemon Jeffery feminized seeds
[26:59.970 --> 27:02.510]  and more Golden Goat feminized seeds.
[27:02.510 --> 27:05.910]  Golden Goat is just a Golden Goat female reversed.
[27:05.910 --> 27:08.010]  I turn it into a boy and I use that pollen
[27:08.010 --> 27:09.730]  on another Golden Goat clone,
[27:09.730 --> 27:12.910]  and that makes Golden Goat S1 self seeds
[27:12.910 --> 27:15.730]  that will make progeny, that'll make offspring.
[27:15.730 --> 27:17.970]  They look just like Golden Goat for the most part.
[27:17.970 --> 27:21.130]  You will have Golden Goat S1 feminized seeds
[27:21.130 --> 27:24.330]  that are reliable Golden Goat looking seeds.
[27:24.330 --> 27:27.490]  Then I took that Golden Goat feminized pollen
[27:27.490 --> 27:31.370]  and I threw some of that on my favorite Lemon Skunk plant.
[27:31.370 --> 27:35.250]  That makes Lemon Jeffery feminized R1 seeds.
[27:35.250 --> 27:39.930]  Those will be giant colas that smell like lemon candy
[27:39.930 --> 27:42.130]  that are just coated in trichomes.
[27:42.130 --> 27:44.810]  The buds are usually bright green and super sticky
[27:44.810 --> 27:47.530]  and it makes amazing concentrates.
[27:48.090 --> 27:51.210]  The Lemon Jeffery and the Golden Goat feminized seeds
[27:51.210 --> 27:52.690]  are almost done.
[27:52.690 --> 27:54.650]  I know I kinda quit talking about it for a minute.
[27:54.650 --> 27:56.410]  It seemed like I was just hyping up a product
[27:56.410 --> 27:57.730]  that wasn't going to be available
[27:57.730 --> 27:59.410]  and a lot of people were asking.
[27:59.410 --> 28:02.250]  You guys, they should be harvested very soon.
[28:02.250 --> 28:03.090]  The seeds are hard.
[28:03.090 --> 28:05.090]  I pulled a couple seeds out, gave them a squeeze.
[28:05.090 --> 28:07.370]  Most of them are hard enough to my satisfaction.
[28:07.370 --> 28:09.210]  I will cut them down very soon
[28:09.210 --> 28:11.230]  and we will have Lemon Jeffery
[28:11.230 --> 28:14.690]  and Golden Goat feminized seeds available
[28:14.690 --> 28:16.530]  in the very near future.
[28:16.530 --> 28:17.370]  All right, you guys, I wanna thank you
[28:17.370 --> 28:18.490]  for listening to this podcast.
[28:18.490 --> 28:20.130]  I know it was another podcast.
[28:20.130 --> 28:22.050]  It's not up to par with what you expect.
[28:22.050 --> 28:24.030]  I'm getting my equipment all dialed back in.
[28:24.030 --> 28:25.610]  Then we will get on those grow lessons
[28:25.610 --> 28:26.810]  like I keep talking about.
[28:26.810 --> 28:27.810]  Just bear with me.
[28:27.810 --> 28:28.890]  Keep coming back.
[28:28.890 --> 28:31.170]  I promise you, I will at least entertain you
[28:31.170 --> 28:32.850]  if you don't learn a lot from me.
[28:32.850 --> 28:34.370]  I had a lot of fun on this episode.
[28:34.370 --> 28:35.650]  So thank you for hanging out.
[28:35.650 --> 28:38.330]  You guys, please leave me more iTunes reviews.
[28:38.330 --> 28:39.990]  Leave me more reviews on Stitcher
[28:39.990 --> 28:42.010]  and please, I would truly appreciate it
