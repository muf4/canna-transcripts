[02:06.480 --> 02:10.880]  is all the information I have got for you I region edX will be there it is in
[02:10.880 --> 02:15.360]  Fort Collins we will be dabbing we will be smoking flowers and I am excited to
[02:15.360 --> 02:19.040]  see you I'm excited to get back out into the community and see some of my
[02:19.040 --> 02:23.640]  old friends and make some new friends shake some hands bump some fists take
[02:23.640 --> 02:27.520]  some dabs share some flowers and most importantly get some seeds out to the
[02:27.520 --> 02:30.560]  community so I do look forward to meeting you seeing you and hanging out
[02:30.560 --> 02:34.760]  at the dude grows cup I'm sure all of the information you need will become
[02:34.760 --> 02:38.400]  available as time goes on I'm sure all of the information is available at dude
[02:38.400 --> 02:43.920]  grows calm so check out dude grows calm for links deets tickets info all of that
[02:43.920 --> 02:47.840]  stuff I am NOT hosting the event I am simply attending and vending at the
[02:47.840 --> 02:51.160]  event trying to be a part of the community going to hang out with the
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.560]  community meet a lot of friends see a lot of people join us the dude grows cup
[02:55.560 --> 02:58.880]  I've said more than enough all right I did say that I've got a bunch of great
[02:58.880 --> 03:03.120]  emails printed here in front of me where do I start how about this one because it
[03:03.120 --> 03:07.320]  is on the top of the list this email came from my friend John this one came
[03:07.320 --> 03:11.160]  to us on the grow help tab at I read genetics comm that's right if you go to
[03:11.160 --> 03:15.560]  the website I read genetics comm there is a grow help tab on there when you
[03:15.560 --> 03:19.400]  click on that grow help tab it does give you the opportunity to answer a few
[03:19.400 --> 03:22.920]  preliminary questions I ask what are you growing are you growing indoors or
[03:22.920 --> 03:26.360]  outdoors what's your temperature what's your humidity what are you feeding this
[03:26.360 --> 03:30.000]  plant I asked several questions that gives me an idea of how to answer your
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.520]  questions people will send me a question they'll say hey my plants yellow what do
[03:33.520 --> 03:37.440]  I do and I've got 20 questions we've kind of cut to the chase and asked some
[03:37.440 --> 03:40.720]  of those so that I've got some info a little bit of a triage a little bit of a
[03:40.720 --> 03:44.560]  checkup if you will so before we get to the main question I ask a few questions
[03:44.560 --> 03:47.880]  our friend John here asked a very simple question so we don't need to know about
[03:47.880 --> 03:52.040]  his plants his grow room this one came from my friend John this is on the grow
[03:52.040 --> 03:55.920]  help tab of course and it goes a lot like this it says hey quick question for
[03:55.920 --> 04:01.360]  you what strains were bred with the e phenotype of a rise that is a very good
[04:01.360 --> 04:05.840]  question there's a lot to talk about here first of all what does John mean
[04:05.840 --> 04:11.200]  when he says the e phenotype of a rise let's talk about that I am known well
[04:11.200 --> 04:15.040]  maybe I'm not I like to think that my strain my brand is known for a strain
[04:15.040 --> 04:20.880]  known as a rise I made a rise f1 I took a golden goat female and a daybreaker
[04:20.880 --> 04:26.400]  male and I made some seeds and I named those arise now out of that batch of a
[04:26.400 --> 04:30.800]  rise seeds I ran a lot of them I ran thousands of those myself and I found
[04:30.800 --> 04:37.000]  several keepers I found the King Solomon male King Solomon my stud male
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.480]  the male that makes my line really potent and popular is known as King
[04:40.480 --> 04:45.920]  Solomon he is a selected phenotype from the arise line so there's a male that
[04:45.920 --> 04:50.000]  got called King Solomon there was another male that is known as the golden
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.720]  goat dominant male it doesn't have a real name I just call it the golden goat
[04:53.720 --> 04:57.160]  male because it's not for sale nobody else touches it nobody's ever seen it
[04:57.160 --> 05:00.640]  but me that's the golden goat male it's over there that is the one that is
[05:00.640 --> 05:05.280]  used to make the golden goat back cross so those are the two males that I kept
[05:05.280 --> 05:10.120]  out of that also there were several stellar females that stood out in the
[05:10.120 --> 05:14.720]  arise line when I would grow them we see what is known as phenotypical expression
[05:14.720 --> 05:19.720]  not all two seeds will grow the same especially in an f1 or a polyhybrid so
[05:19.720 --> 05:23.080]  when you cross a plant when you cross two plants you got a male and a female
[05:23.080 --> 05:27.680]  right the offspring are going to show some mommy traits some daddy traits some
[05:27.680 --> 05:31.120]  of them may show grandparent traits and then some may be right in the middle you
[05:31.120 --> 05:34.600]  never know what ratios you're gonna get until you do the breeding so that is
[05:34.600 --> 05:38.880]  where phenotypical expression comes in some of these plants were taller some of
[05:38.880 --> 05:44.080]  them were skinnier some more more squat some more real branchy some of them were
[05:44.080 --> 05:49.240]  super potent some of them were not as potent these are the different phenotypes
[05:49.240 --> 05:53.360]  I was finding as I was growing these plants different expressions of the
[05:53.360 --> 05:56.440]  genes maybe that's different genotypes and phenotype is the expression of the
[05:56.440 --> 06:00.480]  room so I was finding the different phenos and genotypes now I was labeling
[06:00.480 --> 06:04.960]  these plants really basically I knew they were called a rise because I named
[06:04.960 --> 06:09.520]  it it was mine so as I grew seeds hypothetically maybe I had a five maybe
[06:09.520 --> 06:12.880]  I had a hundred pack of seeds as I would grow them as I would plant them I would
[06:12.880 --> 06:17.080]  just number them arise number one arise number two arise number three up to the
[06:17.080 --> 06:20.600]  number that I was using so I did letters the next time and it was probably a
[06:20.600 --> 06:25.600]  through like G or somewhere that's like 13 right get 13 14 maybe 20 down the
[06:25.600 --> 06:32.040]  alphabet is as far as I'd usually go so that is where the arise e comes from we
[06:32.040 --> 06:35.240]  have found a specific phenotype that I kept it was just a plant that I went I
[06:35.240 --> 06:39.320]  like that one and the cup or the pot or the label happened to be labeled arise
[06:39.320 --> 06:43.480]  number and I know it's a letter but it's a rise number e so I kept that one
[06:43.480 --> 06:47.440]  because I liked it for a specific reason that is where the letter schemes come
[06:47.440 --> 06:52.280]  from now let's talk about these arise letter indications there was a rise
[06:52.280 --> 06:57.080]  number four there was number seven there was number eight there is number
[06:57.080 --> 07:02.320]  e and there was number a were my five favorites of all-time growing thousands
[07:02.320 --> 07:07.280]  of seeds of arise then there were the two males of course the King Solomon
[07:07.280 --> 07:11.160]  and the golden goat looking male so I've got seven that stuck around at this time
[07:11.160 --> 07:17.520]  I have eliminated all of the females except number four number four is a stud
[07:17.520 --> 07:22.080]  not a stud number four is a champion if it was a stud it'd be a dude number four
[07:22.080 --> 07:26.400]  is fucking awesome number four is an amazing plant number four is a keeper
[07:26.400 --> 07:30.120]  it's got the potency that I look for it's got the vigor that I look for it's
[07:30.120 --> 07:34.760]  got the bud density and shape and type that I look for it's got a leaf shape
[07:34.760 --> 07:38.800]  that I look for it's got plant structure it is the champion it does all of the
[07:38.800 --> 07:43.880]  things that I wanted my arise plant to do so number four has stuck around number
[07:43.880 --> 07:48.160]  four was the the perfect one I can't even do this the one that was the one
[07:48.160 --> 07:52.920]  I'm gonna try to remember off the top of my head here number eight was good it
[07:52.920 --> 07:57.280]  was more golden goatee and a little bit more sativa number e I think was the
[07:57.280 --> 08:03.080]  super real tall real long finisher real psychedelic finishing phenotype so I
[08:03.080 --> 08:06.160]  don't have a list of which phenotype was which here it's a it's a lot to remember
[08:06.160 --> 08:08.760]  when you get into breeding a lot of strains and trying to remember specific
[08:08.760 --> 08:13.760]  phenos but that is where the letters come from so you'll see this in other
[08:13.880 --> 08:18.160]  breeders you'll see it in my work a lot of time you'll see a rise so there's
[08:18.160 --> 08:21.840]  right now available and this is what my friend inspired our friend John's
[08:21.840 --> 08:28.360]  question right now available is a rise f2 number four and a rise f2 number e and
[08:28.360 --> 08:33.160]  a rise f2 number seven those have been distributed and shared with friends I
[08:33.160 --> 08:36.560]  shouldn't say available because those are probably gone by the time you hear
[08:36.560 --> 08:39.920]  this but those have been made and our friends are getting those so why did I
[08:40.040 --> 08:46.480]  call them f2 number e because I probably used the same male in a batch right I
[08:46.480 --> 08:51.800]  got the one male I was King Solomon and then I had five different females of a
[08:51.800 --> 08:55.080]  rise in there and they were all labeled the different phenotypes from which they
[08:55.080 --> 09:00.040]  came from from their original pheno hot so there was a rise f1 number four a
[09:00.040 --> 09:03.880]  rise f1 number two all the way up there were five of them that were selected we
[09:03.880 --> 09:07.800]  had number four number seven number eight numbers a and number e and then
[09:07.800 --> 09:11.960]  those all got pollinated by the King Solomon to make the f2 and now that
[09:11.960 --> 09:18.520]  became a rise f2 number a or a rise number a f2 I'm not sure how I labeled
[09:18.520 --> 09:21.920]  it either way as long as the f2 and the number a is indicated in there that is
[09:21.920 --> 09:26.360]  to let you know let the consumer know which phenotype of the female I use
[09:26.360 --> 09:29.640]  which female phenotype of the arise I use because it will make a difference
[09:29.640 --> 09:33.960]  the number four will stay shorter and squatty or the e is gonna get real tall
[09:33.960 --> 09:37.520]  like a fishing pole so that does make a difference you've also seen me do this
[09:37.520 --> 09:42.200]  in the Jack the Ripper f2s there are Jack the Ripper f2 number two number
[09:42.200 --> 09:45.560]  three number four and number five I believe is how I numbered those so those
[09:45.560 --> 09:49.360]  are also available with different numbers you'll see another seed company
[09:49.360 --> 09:52.480]  we're not gonna bring anybody else's names into this but you'll see they do
[09:52.480 --> 09:57.640]  version a and version B which is just simply probably I'm assuming they had a
[09:57.640 --> 10:00.840]  they grew from seed they found two really stellar keepers that were
[10:00.840 --> 10:04.340]  different but they were both keepers for different reasons so they bred them to
[10:04.340 --> 10:07.820]  the same male so let's just say that I've got I grow a batch of seeds and I
[10:07.820 --> 10:12.780]  find two stellar females one is super potent and really super potent we'll
[10:12.780 --> 10:15.380]  just focus on the potency of this one and then I've got another one that
[10:15.380 --> 10:19.640]  fucking tastes super good so I've got a version a and a version B as long as I
[10:19.640 --> 10:22.700]  make a note of which is which then it's cool to have two different versions not
[10:22.700 --> 10:25.940]  a big deal you could sell them both advertise them both mark and both grow
[10:25.940 --> 10:28.740]  them both as long as people know what they're getting the flavor or the
[10:28.740 --> 10:33.100]  potency then what's to stop me from taking a male one male and pollinating
[10:33.100 --> 10:38.620]  both of them and offering the version a and version B of the same cross we could
[10:38.620 --> 10:42.420]  name it the same thing you could call it fist bump that that's a cool strain name
[10:42.420 --> 10:45.580]  don't fucking steal that fist bump I'm claiming that strain name that could be
[10:45.580 --> 10:49.460]  fist bump version 1 and fist bump version 2 that wouldn't be a problem
[10:49.460 --> 10:53.020]  just list what the parents were and that's two different two different
[10:53.020 --> 10:57.500]  crosses of the same thing basically so that is why we see letters in there thank
[10:57.500 --> 11:02.140]  you for inspiring me to ramble and rant about letters and weird seed package
[11:02.220 --> 11:05.620]  labels I hope I covered some ground there and I hope any of that was useful
[11:05.620 --> 11:09.260]  to some of you folks out there who may have seed packs with version 2 or
[11:09.260 --> 11:13.820]  version B or phenotype a written on the package that's why we're doing it the
[11:13.820 --> 11:17.180]  breeder is trying to give you as much detailed information as we can share
[11:17.180 --> 11:20.300]  with you on the package to where you know what you're working with I'd like
[11:20.300 --> 11:23.140]  you to know what you're working with I'd like to know what I'm working with it
[11:23.140 --> 11:27.620]  makes it easy set yourself up for success all right I am rambling let's
[11:27.620 --> 11:31.340]  keep me back on track and move to the next message this one is great this one
[11:31.340 --> 11:36.100]  came from our friend mark and it goes a lot like this it says yo Rasta Jeff I
[11:36.100 --> 11:40.740]  just watched your show about reversing male plants and I was curious if female
[11:40.740 --> 11:45.220]  plants can detect a male plant nearby and if so how is it a pheromone the male
[11:45.220 --> 11:49.580]  plant emits or is it something else thanks for all you do and I will give my
[11:49.580 --> 11:55.380]  mom a hug kind regards from mark this is a great question I don't have any
[11:55.380 --> 12:00.360]  scientifical data any real evidence other than observation personal
[12:00.360 --> 12:05.720]  observation I've been growing for years I've been cultivating in small scales
[12:05.720 --> 12:09.920]  and large scales for a long time I have had the privilege of having male plants
[12:09.920 --> 12:14.440]  in the same room same house as female plants and attempting and successfully
[12:14.440 --> 12:19.560]  finishing a seedless sensa me a crop in one room while pollinating another crop
[12:19.560 --> 12:25.280]  in another room of the same house so the evidence that I do have may may be
[12:25.280 --> 12:29.400]  useful the scientific report I have may be useful but this is what I have
[12:29.400 --> 12:34.360]  observed when I do have females in one room and they are waiting for pollen and
[12:34.360 --> 12:38.280]  they know there's a male plant in the other room who's starting to skeet I do
[12:38.280 --> 12:43.680]  believe and I do see those female plants flowering more quickly and producing
[12:43.680 --> 12:47.200]  more pistols it looks like they're putting off more spaces to receive the
[12:47.200 --> 12:51.360]  pollen I've seen this a couple of times I feel like they get stickier they get
[12:51.360 --> 12:55.080]  more pistols and they do grow more rapidly I don't know what causes it I
[12:55.080 --> 12:58.680]  will give you credit for the idea or the assumption that it's a pheromone or
[12:58.680 --> 13:02.360]  something similar because that would make sense when I smell my girl come
[13:02.360 --> 13:06.200]  into the room I do get excited so maybe that boy plant maybe those girl plants
[13:06.200 --> 13:09.000]  know the other one is there and they're just smelling each other and just
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.200]  getting horny and starting to make more flowers so that the magic can happen
[13:12.200 --> 13:16.600]  also I do notice that if I'm just collecting pollen and there's no females
[13:16.600 --> 13:20.160]  around the dudes don't produce as much pollen as they would if there were
[13:20.160 --> 13:23.320]  actually females in the room that's something else that I have noticed so I
[13:23.320 --> 13:26.600]  do think the plants know that they are there I think the plants can detect the
[13:26.600 --> 13:30.080]  presence of the opposite sex I think they can detect the presence of other
[13:30.080 --> 13:34.680]  plants I also think they can detect the presence of pests and the presence of us
[13:34.680 --> 13:40.040]  I've said it before those plants think that I'm just the delivery mechanism the
[13:40.040 --> 13:43.520]  delivery guy that shows up with cow mag that's all the plants think that I'm
[13:43.520 --> 13:47.040]  there for they're like is he here he's got the cow mag yay that's that's all
[13:47.040 --> 13:50.000]  the plants think about me and they're grateful that I gave it to him so I do
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.800]  think that the plants know I do think they get stickier I think they start
[13:53.800 --> 13:57.640]  flowering more quickly and they do get more pistols so I think that's a great
[13:57.640 --> 14:01.160]  answer to your question I don't have a lot of scientific evidence behind that
[14:01.160 --> 14:06.760]  other than I've bred in the same house and I've seen the plants get stickier
[14:06.760 --> 14:09.880]  because I think they knew that their date was on the other side of the room
[14:09.880 --> 14:12.680]  just getting prepped for him she's over there putting on her perfume and
[14:12.680 --> 14:15.640]  shaving her legs and that dude is over there doing push-ups until we introduced
[14:15.640 --> 14:19.400]  him all right that is enough of that one I've been rambling on there's one more
[14:19.400 --> 14:22.360]  great question that I did receive I did not print it because my printer ran out
[14:22.360 --> 14:26.240]  of paper so I just took a quick note of it this one said hey Rasta Jeff why is
[14:26.240 --> 14:30.600]  some stuff only available in fem seed and other lines are only available in
[14:30.600 --> 14:34.800]  regular seeds that is a very good question as a seed breeder I've got a
[14:34.800 --> 14:39.320]  very good answer for that why is some stuff only available let's start off
[14:39.320 --> 14:43.040]  with fem seed that is the easiest answer why is some stuff only available in
[14:43.040 --> 14:47.760]  fems I have to start off by teaching you about what is known as a clone only
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.800]  golden goat is what we call a clone only when the maker the original breeder
[14:52.800 --> 14:56.560]  of golden goat who was not me I've got to give mr. dank and Topeka Kansas
[14:56.560 --> 14:59.720]  credit for breeding the golden goat I did not breed that a lot of people give
[14:59.720 --> 15:03.320]  me the credit did not do it don't want the credit I made enough of my own stuff
[15:03.320 --> 15:07.640]  don't need to steal credit for that one however golden goat is a clone only
[15:07.640 --> 15:11.460]  which means when the original breeder made the golden goat they did not give
[15:11.460 --> 15:15.880]  out any clones or seeds of other phenotypes of that cultivar they've got
[15:15.880 --> 15:20.240]  so the breeder made a handful of seeds right he grew them he found the winner
[15:20.240 --> 15:24.840]  he shared that one did not give anything else out there are no seeds to be had of
[15:24.840 --> 15:29.280]  the golden goat so it is a clone only there's that one female clone which
[15:29.280 --> 15:35.860]  means there is no real true male golden goat plant which brings us to why there
[15:35.860 --> 15:41.140]  are only fem seeds because imagine if you only had one rhinoceros and it was a
[15:41.220 --> 15:46.300]  female make more rhinos you need some sperm or a male rhino to do that and
[15:46.300 --> 15:51.100]  with golden goat there's only a female so we cannot make regular golden goat
[15:51.100 --> 15:55.220]  seeds unless we adulterate it which I have taken the liberty of doing so I
[15:55.220 --> 15:59.060]  have pollinated that with another plant we've done some work to it we have done
[15:59.060 --> 16:03.260]  what is known as a back cross I've done full episodes on back crossing back
[16:03.260 --> 16:08.020]  crossing is the solution when you want seeds of a plant that is only a clone
[16:08.020 --> 16:13.380]  only no male exists there are ways to kind of replicate recreate what's it
[16:13.380 --> 16:17.820]  called reverse engineer may be the better word to create a line that is non
[16:17.820 --> 16:22.100]  which is a clone only which has a no male pollen donor available there are
[16:22.100 --> 16:26.780]  ways to work around that but that's an adulteration that is not a pure version
[16:26.780 --> 16:31.500]  of that plant so if we make feminized seeds we only need that female plant
[16:31.500 --> 16:36.300]  because in a female product a feminized process I would take we're gonna stick
[16:36.300 --> 16:39.740]  with golden goat I would take a clone of the golden goat I would take another
[16:39.740 --> 16:43.980]  clone of the golden goat these are both golden goat clones I would treat one
[16:43.980 --> 16:48.100]  clone with a solution I've done a full episode on this that solution would
[16:48.100 --> 16:52.900]  cause this golden goat plant to make pollen which is only female pollen which
[16:52.900 --> 16:57.300]  also only contains golden goat chromosomes only the genetics of golden
[16:57.300 --> 17:00.820]  goat so we are not adulterating the golden goat line I'm gonna take that
[17:00.820 --> 17:04.660]  golden goat pollen and put it on a golden goat female now we have made
[17:04.660 --> 17:09.020]  golden goat s1 we have selfed our golden goat which all those seeds will
[17:09.020 --> 17:13.820]  be very very close to the original golden goat so that is why some things
[17:13.820 --> 17:18.060]  are available only in feminized seed because it was a clone only plant
[17:18.060 --> 17:21.860]  meaning there were no seeds which means there was no male which means if we
[17:21.860 --> 17:26.380]  wanted to create a seed from that it either needs to be selfed or adulterated
[17:26.380 --> 17:29.900]  and many people don't want the adulterated version of golden goat they
[17:29.900 --> 17:34.340]  want the original pure version of golden goat now let's talk about the other
[17:34.340 --> 17:40.100]  side of that coin many people are not fans of feminized seeds back in the day
[17:40.100 --> 17:44.460]  many of the Dutch makers were not making fem seeds properly quality control was
[17:44.460 --> 17:48.420]  not what it should be we figured it out now fems are a lot better but because of
[17:48.420 --> 17:53.060]  miseducation or trial and error that didn't go well many growers are
[17:53.060 --> 17:56.820]  disgruntled or they have a bad taste in their mouth or they are simply opposed
[17:56.820 --> 18:02.980]  to using fem seeds in that same vein many breeders are opposed to making
[18:03.020 --> 18:07.220]  feminized seeds many people that many people that make seeds feel like making
[18:07.220 --> 18:11.180]  fems is kind of a dead end what do you do if you don't use a male you've got to
[18:11.180 --> 18:15.300]  keep reversing something in my opinion that is fine I know a few other breeders
[18:15.300 --> 18:19.060]  that really agree with the idea of using a an alpha female plant something a
[18:19.060 --> 18:22.340]  really a badass female plant could really make a lot of good breeding
[18:22.340 --> 18:25.660]  projects but a lot of breeders don't agree with that they only want the
[18:25.660 --> 18:29.860]  natural selection of a male and female plant so that is why a lot of things are
[18:29.860 --> 18:34.780]  only available in regular seed because when you make a cross you take a male
[18:34.780 --> 18:37.980]  plant and a female plant you put the pollen on the female it makes a lot of
[18:37.980 --> 18:41.340]  seeds now you've got your cross that happens naturally that is easy to do
[18:41.340 --> 18:46.900]  creating feminized seeds from that line is a different line of work it involves
[18:46.900 --> 18:51.060]  treating a select it involves selecting a plant to be a pollen donor it involves
[18:51.060 --> 18:55.060]  selecting female plants to receive that pollen then it also involves treating
[18:55.180 --> 18:59.900]  the selected pollen donor with a chemical solution a certain amount of
[18:59.900 --> 19:03.220]  times there's work to be done you've got to treat a plant you've got to reverse
[19:03.220 --> 19:06.060]  it you've got to do some manipulation then you've got to make the pollen
[19:06.060 --> 19:10.940]  happen you've got to chuck the pollen and then honestly when I make reg seeds
[19:10.940 --> 19:15.860]  I get 50% more seed than I do when I make feminized seed that's why fem seeds
[19:15.860 --> 19:20.140]  are twice as expensive they cost twice as much to make they take twice as long
[19:20.140 --> 19:24.860]  to make so a lot of seeds are only available in reg seed because a
[19:24.860 --> 19:29.100]  feminized grower a feminized breeder has not taken the time to create a
[19:29.100 --> 19:34.380]  feminized line from that project or that product it's a whole nother step it's a
[19:34.380 --> 19:38.420]  lot more work it could be it could be six nine maybe twelve more months worth
[19:38.420 --> 19:43.660]  of work to get that feminized line out to you so the reason why some things are
[19:43.660 --> 19:48.180]  available in femme is because the breeder a breeder like myself that is
[19:48.180 --> 19:52.020]  interested in making femmes has done the work to make the femme seeds available
[19:52.020 --> 19:55.260]  the reason why some stuff is only available in regs is because some
[19:55.260 --> 19:58.860]  breeders they either haven't done it yet or they are just not interested in
[19:58.860 --> 20:03.740]  making stuff in regular seed a lot of the times that femme is because it was
[20:03.740 --> 20:07.140]  only available as a clone only in the only way you're gonna get seeds of it is
[20:07.140 --> 20:11.860]  through making femmes so I hope I answered that question I do have a lot
[20:11.860 --> 20:15.020]  of other episodes about bat crosses about femme seeds I do invite you to
