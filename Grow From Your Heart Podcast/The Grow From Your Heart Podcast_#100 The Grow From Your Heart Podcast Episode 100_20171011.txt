[01:10.780 --> 01:11.780]  remain anonymous?
[01:11.780 --> 01:14.460]  No, I'm good. I'm out there. You can find me.
[01:14.460 --> 01:15.940]  He's out there but it's all good.
[01:15.940 --> 01:20.620]  He's not advertising. If anybody remembers, Joe is our photography guru. They came and
[01:20.620 --> 01:24.620]  taught us a bunch about improving our cannabis photography. He is back. He's joining us.
[01:24.620 --> 01:26.100]  So thanks for coming bro.
[01:26.100 --> 01:29.780]  A little bit closer to me is the beautiful Miss Maddie from the Garden of Weden. How
[01:29.780 --> 01:30.780]  you doing?
[01:30.780 --> 01:33.540]  Hello. I'm doing well. Congratulations on episode 100.
[01:33.540 --> 01:36.780]  Thank you so much. Hey, congrats on getting rid of your head cold. You sound much better.
[01:36.780 --> 01:39.060]  Thank you. I've got tea over here keeping me going.
[01:39.060 --> 01:41.980]  We weren't sure that Maddie was going to make it. She kind of sounded like a dude a couple
[01:41.980 --> 01:42.980]  of days ago.
[01:42.980 --> 01:45.140]  Hey, don't laugh at me.
[01:45.140 --> 01:48.180]  You sound much better. You sounded much better. Thanks for joining me.
[01:48.180 --> 01:49.180]  No problem.
[01:49.180 --> 01:53.420]  To my kind of front and right is the legend, the man, Mr. Garden of Weden himself. What's
[01:53.420 --> 01:54.420]  up Spence? How you doing brother?
[01:54.420 --> 01:55.420]  What's up my nigga?
[01:55.420 --> 01:57.860]  Dude, thanks for coming brother. I appreciate you being here.
[01:57.860 --> 01:59.460]  Anytime, anytime dude.
[01:59.460 --> 02:03.220]  Dang, it's exciting to have all of these people here. This is the crew you guys. We should
[02:03.220 --> 02:06.340]  have some like, I should have some cheering sound effects to hit on the computer right
[02:06.340 --> 02:08.820]  now because this is going to be awesome.
[02:08.820 --> 02:14.820]  This is episode 100. So I am right now currently cracking open a 100 milligram Incredibles
[02:14.820 --> 02:20.580]  pumpkin pie delight, pumpkin spice and graham cracker edibles. This thing's got 100 milligrams.
[02:20.580 --> 02:24.940]  Shout out to my friend Craig for throwing this down. He said, eat this on episode 100.
[02:24.940 --> 02:27.860]  Enjoy it. Give me a shout out. So shout out to Craig. If you listen to this, I appreciate
[02:27.860 --> 02:28.860]  it.
[02:28.860 --> 02:29.860]  Thanks, Craig.
[02:29.860 --> 02:30.860]  Thank you, Craig.
[02:30.860 --> 02:35.340]  Yeah. Also on the table, I've got an affogato. Is that how you say it? Affogato? Affogato
[02:35.340 --> 02:41.340]  bar. And there's also a pumpkin pie, a pumpkin pie delight bar on the table. If anybody would
[02:41.340 --> 02:45.220]  like some pieces of these edibles, feel free to jump in you guys. As long as I get like
[02:45.220 --> 02:49.460]  this much of this affogato, I'll be cool with life. No, get some, get at it you guys. Let's
[02:49.460 --> 02:53.260]  eat some edibles. We're going to get lit up. You can already hear Sloppy and Joe over there
[02:53.260 --> 02:58.780]  taking dabs. Before we go too far, let's mention, yeah, Mike already kind of got me to it. The
[02:58.780 --> 03:03.500]  uh, okay, then I'm gonna grab this. Do it Joe, do it. Do it. Do it. I'm claiming that
[03:03.500 --> 03:06.300]  I'm not going to say anything. So, uh, there is a, what was the, where the hell was I going
[03:06.300 --> 03:09.700]  to say? Oh, the emails are hot. That's right. Fucking sloppy and Joe were chilling at the
[03:09.700 --> 03:13.980]  furniture table over there. We got two emails built into the table. Shout out to my boy,
[03:13.980 --> 03:18.620]  Bobo blaster co for sending me the dope ass table. These guys are getting dabbed the fuck
[03:18.620 --> 03:21.980]  out. I don't even think they're on the podcast. They're so they're taking dabs, eating edibles
[03:21.980 --> 03:27.740]  and chilling like Beavis and butt head crying, crying auxiliary microphone team. Yes, I like
[03:27.740 --> 03:32.020]  it. They are sharing a microphone and they are sexy with it, but there you go. Nice.
[03:32.420 --> 03:35.820]  All right, I'm going to dig into this freaking, let's see. I'm going to start with a bite
[03:35.820 --> 03:40.180]  of this affogato. So I think I'm gonna need 120 milligrams to get started. Probably. I'm
[03:40.180 --> 03:48.620]  loving that one. It was really, it tastes like a Starbucks drink in a medical bar. It
[03:48.620 --> 03:53.660]  is exactly that bro. It's delicious. Mike's grabbing the label for me. No, we lose a hundred
[03:53.660 --> 04:00.420]  milligram bar from incredibles and the label reads off a God, Oh, vanilla latte, espresso
[04:00.420 --> 04:04.300]  beans and caramel swirl. And it's fucking delicious. It is delicious. I'm digging this.
[04:04.300 --> 04:08.060]  It's really tasty. It's like a, a white chocolate cookies and cream bar with coffee beans in
[04:08.060 --> 04:13.420]  it. Yep. Yeah. Why y'all sleeping on the pumpkin pie? I've got a whole year that I'm going
[04:13.420 --> 04:18.700]  to eat. Yeah. Um, and big shout out to incredibles. These pieces are perfectly sectioned and labeled
[04:18.700 --> 04:23.700]  into 10 milligram doses. The recommended dosage for a newb is 10 milligrams. It's easy to
[04:23.700 --> 04:27.620]  see what 10 milligrams should be. There should be no dosage concerns for people from out
[04:27.620 --> 04:31.380]  of state. This is proper. I like this. We simplified it for everybody here. It tastes
[04:31.380 --> 04:37.020]  amazing as well. It does. I like this. Af Af. I forgot. Oh, Afro Gato. I think it's
[04:37.020 --> 04:42.740]  delicious. I forgot. Oh, I forgot. Oh, I forgot. Oh, you guys, before we go too far, I want
[04:42.740 --> 04:46.300]  to get serious for just a couple of seconds here. We need to give a shout out to our friends,
[04:46.300 --> 04:52.140]  Justin and Jessica and their family. Um, they have an 11 year old son and he had a major
[04:52.140 --> 04:55.060]  seizure. He has some technical, sorry. You hear those coffee beans crunching in my teeth.
[04:55.060 --> 05:00.740]  I apologize for that. Uh, Justin and Jessica have an 11 year old son who currently is having
[05:00.740 --> 05:04.940]  brain surgery. So I want to send a big, uh, just a silent vibration to those guys for
[05:04.940 --> 05:09.100]  half a second. See, that was for them. Uh, I want their son to heal. I want him to be
[05:09.100 --> 05:13.100]  better and I want them to feel comforted. So just a big shout out to Justin and Jessica.
[05:13.100 --> 05:16.460]  Hey, I hope you guys get much better. I hope everything goes great for you guys. Much love
[05:16.460 --> 05:22.140]  and support from the growth from your heart podcast and everybody here at the table. Dang.
[05:22.140 --> 05:25.540]  She went silent, somber. You could feel the love and the concern in the room. Thank you
[05:25.540 --> 05:29.980]  guys. That was honest. I was hoping for a speedy recovery. Yes. I just got a kid out
[05:29.980 --> 05:34.340]  of the hospital, so I'm feeling for you. Yeah. Much love to the whole family there. Much
[05:34.340 --> 05:39.300]  support from the show and everybody here. So also the same person sent me a message.
[05:39.300 --> 05:43.620]  Uh, I asked for memories from the podcast. I said, Joseph, they're dying. Uh, if you
[05:43.620 --> 05:46.140]  guys need bottles of water or anything, I got them here on the table and make yourselves
[05:46.140 --> 05:53.020]  at home guys. So, uh, Jessica sent me a Twitter message and it said, you've got to talk about
[05:53.020 --> 05:59.100]  when the dude tried to dab the microphone. Everybody just, uh, Mike was here one night
[05:59.100 --> 06:03.900]  and we were recording a show and I handed him the rig and I handed him the carb cap.
[06:03.900 --> 06:08.980]  He held the rig in one hand. He put the dab onto the nail and he put his mouth onto the
[06:08.980 --> 06:12.500]  microphone and tried to inhale through the microphone. Yep. Took a big old head off the
[06:12.500 --> 06:19.580]  microphone. It was really funny. It made me laugh for like a good 10 minutes. I think
[06:19.580 --> 06:23.500]  we had to press pause because I laughed my ass off. Yep. I'm laughing. Just thinking
[06:23.500 --> 06:34.820]  about it. How high was he? I had the rig and I dabbed it and capped it and then just yeah.
[06:34.820 --> 06:38.000]  And he couldn't figure out why the smoke wasn't coming through. I stared at the microphone
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.120]  for a second, mad. Like, why isn't this rig working? It's right in my face. I'm hitting
[06:42.740 --> 06:45.700]  it. I kind of saw what was happening. Kind of wasn't sure what I saw happening. Like
[06:45.700 --> 06:49.540]  I was pretty sure that that's what was going on. So Maddie just busted off a piece of the
[06:49.540 --> 06:53.900]  pumpkin bar. I'm busting off a piece of the pumpkin bar. Joe just came in for some pumpkin
[06:53.900 --> 06:59.420]  bar. I'm not a fan of edibles and this was delicious. I'll break another. Cheers to everybody
[06:59.420 --> 07:02.660]  that's taken a bite of their pumpkin bar. Let's see what this thing tastes like. Let's
[07:02.660 --> 07:06.260]  try to keep track of what I've eaten. So I've had, this will be, I've had 20 milligrams
[07:06.260 --> 07:12.400]  so far. This will be 30 and 40. What are these chips in it? Anyone know? Graham cracker.
[07:12.400 --> 07:19.400]  Wow. Pumpkin pie for real. That is delicious. That is an amazing edible. We're so spoiled
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.800]  here. No more weed flavor in our pop food. Well, the coffee, the coffee beans really
[07:24.800 --> 07:28.960]  take away that after bite. True. So I guess with the pumpkin pie. Okay, now I do get the
[07:28.960 --> 07:31.920]  weedy kind of aftertaste. A little bit of the weed aftertaste. But you know what? It's
[07:31.920 --> 07:35.640]  worth it. It's earthy and it blends well with the pumpkin flavor. I kind of like it. Like
[07:35.640 --> 07:40.040]  Parmesan cheese on spaghetti. This and a milkshake. Maddie is onto something. All right.
[07:40.040 --> 07:44.760]  So the Incredibles pumpkin pie delight, pumpkin spice and graham crackers. Rasta Jeff approves.
[07:44.760 --> 07:49.840]  This is a hundred milligrams. If you're not an experienced ganja edible eater, you're
[07:49.840 --> 07:52.840]  going to be wrecked because you're just going to keep eating this thing because it is delicious.
[07:52.840 --> 07:59.840]  Yeah, you can't stop. Got to remember this one. Microphone voice. Just scream. Yeah.
[08:00.840 --> 08:07.340]  If you're even if you have a sweet tooth, you have no chance of saving this bar. This
[08:07.340 --> 08:10.720]  is delicious. Yeah, I'm just going to be silent. Eat this thing for the next five minutes.
[08:10.720 --> 08:15.720]  This is delicious. All right. So we've pumped up this Incredibles company enough. Unfortunately,
[08:15.720 --> 08:20.720]  the pumpkin spice one is only seasonal. It's only around around the holidays here. This
[08:20.720 --> 08:24.160]  will be out in just a few days. So you guys, when you hear this, go to the spot dispensary
[08:24.160 --> 08:27.560]  in Pueblo West Colorado and grab yourself some Incredibles edibles. They're delicious.
[08:27.880 --> 08:31.280]  And tell them that Rasta Jeff sent you and that you heard about the spot from the Grow
[08:31.280 --> 08:38.280]  From Your Heart podcast. Even me? Everybody. Yeah, go buy edibles there. Holy crap. I need
[08:38.280 --> 08:45.280]  to take a quick sip. This thing's kind of drying up my face. I'm 40 milligrams deep.
[08:45.280 --> 08:49.280]  Right on. Maddie and I are teaming up on the edibles. There's more over here, you guys.
[08:49.280 --> 08:54.280]  If you want to crack open more, do not be afraid. I know what we should mention, though.
[08:54.280 --> 08:58.600]  We have two Cannabis Cup winners at the table and we have not even acknowledged that. You
[08:58.600 --> 09:02.600]  guys, congrats on the show. You haven't been on the show since you won a cup. Congratulations.
[09:02.600 --> 09:05.600]  I don't think you've been here since you won a cup. Wow. Thank you. I appreciate that a
[09:05.600 --> 09:10.600]  lot. Yeah. I still remember that when they said I remember when they announced it, they
[09:10.600 --> 09:16.300]  said and CBD concentrate goes to and they said, oh, gee. And before they finished the
[09:16.300 --> 09:19.680]  name of the strain, I threw my arms up in the air and I looked at my friend that was
[09:19.680 --> 09:23.960]  with me and I was like, that's the Garden of Weed. I was so stoked for you guys. I was
[09:23.960 --> 09:29.440]  proud of shit. When they said it, I didn't even realize that it was us. Like they said
[09:29.440 --> 09:32.880]  it and I kept like saying it over and over again in my head. But Spencer was like, Maddie,
[09:32.880 --> 09:37.080]  let's go. And like my friends all started rushing up on the stage with us. That was
[09:37.080 --> 09:40.480]  the best part is everyone was on stage with us. It was great to see. I was in the back
[09:40.480 --> 09:43.880]  taking pictures. It's good to see you guys up there. I'm proud of you. So good job. Good
[09:43.880 --> 09:47.420]  job. There's another Cannabis Cup coming up in the future. Do you guys have anything planned
[09:47.420 --> 09:53.560]  for that? Which one? Oh, which one? Well, I was thinking about Denver, but unfortunately,
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.320]  Cali just got canceled. If we get lucky enough to have a cup of Denver, then I'll do it again.
[09:59.320 --> 10:03.480]  But I just with the way everything's going, I don't think that stuff's going to last much
[10:03.480 --> 10:10.600]  longer. That's true. Unless it's like in like, I know like Jamaica, that'll be fine. They're
[10:10.600 --> 10:14.360]  not going to touch Jamaica because it's in a different country. And it's our first time.
[10:14.360 --> 10:19.160]  They've already approved that with the Jamaican council. And then I think Michigan, I was
[10:19.160 --> 10:24.080]  looking on the website today and Michigan has either Michigan, no, it's California.
[10:24.080 --> 10:31.400]  The one in LA that they do February of every year. Bless you Mike. Is going to have like
[10:31.400 --> 10:35.880]  two weekends. So it's going to be one weekend and then like, I don't know what they're doing
[10:35.880 --> 10:41.080]  the entire week and then the next weekend. It's like, so things are changing with like
[10:41.080 --> 10:48.240]  different states trying to allow high times. I think it just comes down to like probably
[10:48.320 --> 10:52.320]  how much money you want to put into it, which they're probably still paying a ridiculous
[10:52.320 --> 10:57.680]  amount to, you know, get locations and stuff. But just when, you know, at cannabis cups,
[10:57.680 --> 11:01.760]  it's usually like people giving away samples and stuff like that. Like that's money that
[11:02.320 --> 11:06.560]  the tax people don't see. So that's something that it's actually written in the rules that
[11:06.560 --> 11:12.960]  they can't give out samples and shit at events like that. Yeah. Well now is it that nobody can
[11:12.960 --> 11:19.840]  give out samples or only established shops with licenses can't give out samples? The problem is
[11:19.840 --> 11:24.560]  when the established shops are giving out licenses, but I heard a police officer say that,
[11:26.320 --> 11:31.120]  he said shops giving out license. I did say that, huh? License shop giving out samples is what I
[11:31.120 --> 11:33.840]  think I meant. Sorry. But then I wanted to talk about something else that I heard. I heard a cop
[11:33.840 --> 11:40.560]  say today that if I give you cannabis, even if I gave it to you, legally that's a sale. There was
[11:40.560 --> 11:44.400]  a transaction there that was considered, they can be considered a sale, even if it's a donation.
[11:45.200 --> 11:48.000]  So there's a lot to be careful about. Yeah. Technically that's a sale.
[11:48.960 --> 11:53.120]  Interesting. I guess that would just be at the cop's discretion. That's exactly what that cop
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.360]  said. Yep. Yeah. So if they want to be a dick about it, they can go ahead and arrest you for
[11:57.360 --> 12:01.360]  me, give arrest, both of us, me for giving it to you and you for accepting it, even though we're
[12:01.360 --> 12:07.760]  both over 21. Wow. Go ahead and slap, grab a microphone. I should just give you guys two
[12:07.760 --> 12:12.400]  mics over there. There we go. What about like, how does that work though? Cause we can smoke with
[12:12.400 --> 12:16.800]  each other. That's very true. I guess as long as neither one of us leaves with anything,
[12:17.440 --> 12:22.960]  yeah. When we pass the joint, right? Because I mean, technically like the definition of a sale
[12:22.960 --> 12:28.880]  is like, Mike, you're the legal guy here. Step in Mike. Well, I don't give direct legal advice.
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.680]  You really just, we need more pro marijuana laws. The federal law needs to change. State
[12:35.680 --> 12:41.200]  laws need to change. I mean, marijuana is legal here. We have pod stores. We still can't gather
[12:41.200 --> 12:47.440]  outside of someone's private residence and consume together legally. All of that's still
[12:47.440 --> 12:53.040]  in a gray market. People are busted for distribution for passing joints or parties,
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.400]  or for having more than an ounce on them or for buying weed that comes in multiple bags or for
[12:58.400 --> 13:03.600]  owning a scale so that they can check their purchase after they buy it. The law needs to
[13:03.600 --> 13:08.240]  change everywhere. And more people need to get politically active. Everybody here just got a
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.520]  ballot mailed to them, fill that out and mail it back in everybody. Yes. Register to vote and then
[13:13.520 --> 13:20.000]  to vote. And if your state is working on cannabis regulations, make sure you write in public
[13:20.560 --> 13:25.600]  consumption facilities of some sort, someplace where you can go and gather and smoke. Just like
[13:25.600 --> 13:30.400]  you can go and drink beer at a bar. You can order shots. You can order beers. Let's do something
[13:30.400 --> 13:34.240]  just like that in your bill. When you go to legalize cannabis in your location, let's put
[13:34.240 --> 13:39.360]  something for you to consume. Everywhere in the U S already has the infrastructure for adults to go
[13:39.360 --> 13:45.120]  out, consume intoxicants and get home safely. Every place has bars, every place, everywhere.
[13:45.120 --> 13:50.240]  All you got to do is call a cab. Cabs aren't going to pull up to the pot consumption tavern or whatever
[13:50.240 --> 13:53.840]  the fuck they call it and go, Oh no, you smell bad. You can't get my car. If they're driving
[13:53.840 --> 13:57.760]  drunks home, they're going to be happy to drive somebody who's known home. All that shit's already
[13:57.760 --> 14:03.040]  in place. We just need to utilize it. And all the stone people are going to make more revenue
[14:03.040 --> 14:06.800]  because you're going to get hungry. You're going to need a taxi. You're going to buy gas. Slop.
[14:06.800 --> 14:16.960]  Your eyes are as red as that table, bro. I'm still a good answer. That's a good answer. I'm a,
[14:16.960 --> 14:23.360]  I've eaten seven, um, eight pieces of this pumpkin bar now. I'm an edible new bro. Yeah,
[14:24.240 --> 14:26.240]  Matt, he's going for more of the coffee. When that one was tasty.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.240]  Piece. Break it. Just break it. Oh,
[14:34.000 --> 14:35.440]  he spent as your team winner. And homie,
[14:36.640 --> 14:42.000]  uh, I don't know my phone's dead, so I can only look at the score of the game. I don't know how
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.720]  many, I'm just watching one person really. Okay. Spence is, Spence is deep in a fantasy football
[14:48.720 --> 14:52.960]  thing over here. I hear him screaming when I go to the house. It's so funny. If sports are on,
[14:52.960 --> 14:56.800]  there'll be, I don't even know what the fuck's happened to my house on Sundays and see how mad,
[14:56.800 --> 15:05.920]  especially when the, the Cowboys lose. Oh, Mike, like a couple of weeks ago. And he literally
[15:05.920 --> 15:10.560]  rampage. We lost his mind. Wow. Wow. That's when you need to give a man a dab. Does anybody
[15:10.560 --> 15:17.440]  need a dab? Yeah, I could go for one. All right, let's get Mike a dab. Do this. I smelled an aroma
[15:17.440 --> 15:21.920]  from somebody's dad before it was pretty, uh, I guess it was, I think that was a New York city
[15:21.920 --> 15:26.320]  diesel. I think I know I've got the New York city diesel. I think it says this libraries or is this
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.320]  a regular blast? Cause it's nice and clear. That's live. I thought that was live. That makes a lot
[15:30.320 --> 15:37.280]  more sense. Uh, here's a dabber. Let's get Mike in New York city diesel live res dab. Yeah. This
[15:37.280 --> 15:41.680]  shit's all those words. Yeah. Right. This shit is super gold, super tasty. It's turpa delic
[15:42.240 --> 15:46.640]  turpa turpa delic. Uh, take a hit of it and then tell me what you think. Well, you're going to
[15:46.640 --> 15:50.960]  cough for 30 minutes. I'll tell you what I think of the flavor dad report coming in a few minutes.
[15:50.960 --> 15:56.640]  It's a, it's stupid smooth. It's got like a, uh, I'll try not to dab the microphone this time.
[15:56.640 --> 16:00.000]  Just, Oh man, it would be great if you did. It would be great. Nope. He got it right. I wasn't
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.720]  enjoying guys. He got it perfectly smooth this time. You guys know there's any dads sitting
[16:04.720 --> 16:07.760]  over there at the kids table. I think that might've been the biggest dab I've ever seen you
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  really working them up. We've been working them up. Got my own torch. The kids at the kids down
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.120]  the flavors here. I'll throw you this container of some, Oh wait, you want this? There we pass
[16:21.120 --> 16:26.400]  that around for slopping Joe. That red. Hey, wait, wait. Sloppy Joe over there. Sloppy Joe.
[16:28.080 --> 16:31.440]  Where else in the world could this happen? Right there at the kids table.
[16:32.480 --> 16:40.560]  You guys got a carb cap over there, right? But it was there. Yeah. I apologize. Uh, I have a
[16:40.560 --> 16:44.720]  Toro rig. Shout out to my friend Nikki. She sold me a Toro rig and it's a go pass little rig. But
[16:44.720 --> 16:50.000]  unfortunately I, uh, left the email on and all of the water evaporated. The slop tried to take a
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.400]  dab and I succeeded in taking a dab. Mike took a dab off of it. I took one. It was just unfortunate.
[16:58.960 --> 17:03.280]  It explains why your eyes are as red as that. And this candy bar that tastes like it came from
[17:03.280 --> 17:08.800]  somebody's grandma. Like, is that a good thing or a bad thing when a candy bar tastes like it
[17:08.800 --> 17:13.680]  came from somebody's grandma? That is a great thing. It is so turpid. Delic. I'm throwing
[17:13.680 --> 17:18.960]  number piece number nine of this one in my mouth. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm going to be right here in about
[17:18.960 --> 17:22.240]  30 or 40 minutes. This is going to be a really fun podcast. You guys, we've got to record for
[17:22.240 --> 17:26.400]  a long time and see what all this stuff does to me. See how high we get. I haven't eaten today.
[17:27.360 --> 17:31.200]  Wow. I haven't eaten. Wow. You're going to be really high. Yeah. I was planning to get
[17:31.200 --> 17:35.520]  some Chipotle after this. Oh, why'd you say Chipotle? That was evil. We can go together.
[17:35.520 --> 17:40.320]  Let's just take pause. All right. Break. We'll be back. We'll be right back. Anybody want anything?
[17:41.040 --> 17:44.160]  And we're back from Chipotle. Not really. I wish we could all go to Chipotle that quickly.
[17:44.160 --> 17:47.280]  That'd be fun. You know they have like a fax machine order. You could just like fax. Oh man.
[17:47.280 --> 17:51.920]  They've got an app now. Man. The wife uses it all the time. Works great. Man. Somebody deliver
[17:51.920 --> 17:57.360]  some Chipotle you guys. Dispensaries have that express app too. Have you seen that? Wow. That's
[17:57.360 --> 18:01.920]  pretty cool. You can order online ahead. That's pretty spiffy. Wow. You just go and type in on
[18:01.920 --> 18:06.640]  your phone like I need two grams of hash and a quarter of good nugs and four Incredibles and
[18:06.640 --> 18:10.160]  I'll be there. Have it in a bag with your name on it. Stapled with your name on it and you show
[18:10.160 --> 18:13.920]  up and they take your cash and you leave. That's the future. It hasn't ever been better. Yeah.
[18:13.920 --> 18:17.760]  Well it's here. Yeah. I wish we could do deliveries in Colorado. Unfortunately,
[18:17.760 --> 18:23.680]  delivery of cannabis has been banned. That's a no-no here. Yeah. They kill it in every other
[18:23.680 --> 18:27.920]  state. Yeah. In the winter man when you don't want to drive to the dispensary when you're like
[18:27.920 --> 18:33.600]  can I just get an eighth delivery? There's so much snow outside. But it is drove around at like a
[18:33.600 --> 18:38.560]  wholesale level right? That's regulated in some way. Yeah. Do they go around in like an armored
[18:38.560 --> 18:43.680]  truck? I know you guys all have tremendous experience in this. I'm an outsider just
[18:43.680 --> 18:49.280]  asking the questions. Just manifested from a place to a place. CBDRX has trucks that are
[18:49.280 --> 18:55.840]  labeled CBDRX which is a CBD company. They specialize in mostly CBD medicine. Yeah go for it
[18:55.840 --> 18:58.800]  Slappy. You don't have to ask for permission to use the men's room. You're headed to it. Take a
[18:58.800 --> 19:04.880]  left as soon as you can. There you go. It's really pink. The restroom is really pink. But CBDRX cruises
[19:04.880 --> 19:09.120]  around with their label on their truck and then they have a trailer with just covered shit on it
[19:09.120 --> 19:13.440]  and you can tell it's just product for days on the trailer. A lot of times it's uh you have to fill
[19:13.440 --> 19:19.040]  out a manifest before you leave. Before the product leaves one building you have to fill out a manifest
[19:19.040 --> 19:26.640]  of the amount of product, the car license plate, the driver, and even the route you're going. Yeah
[19:26.640 --> 19:30.720]  the route that you're going to take has to be documented. Because you can't be like off like if
[19:30.720 --> 19:36.400]  you get caught like 30 minutes off of your path you're supposed to go to they could like say you're
[19:36.400 --> 19:40.640]  doing you know what I'm saying. Yeah just in case. Yeah so you can't stop in McDonald's or nothing on the
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.120]  way even if it's like a four-hour drive. Everything here is hyper regulated guys. Yeah and then you
[19:45.120 --> 19:50.640]  have to fax that to the MED uh like 24 hours before you leave and they have to approve it
[19:50.640 --> 19:54.400]  and then when you get the product there you have to basically do the opposite of everything. Has to
[19:54.400 --> 20:00.640]  get signed by the other people. Yeah and then weighed and then faxed that it was received.
[20:00.640 --> 20:04.960]  Yeah so they really track all of the product here in Colorado. They pay a lot of attention. They
[20:04.960 --> 20:09.840]  call it the seed to sale model. Uh from the minute that we germinate a seed in the shop it's under
[20:09.840 --> 20:16.560]  camera and it has a MIPS number and an RFID and it'll be that RFID until harvest time and when it
[20:16.560 --> 20:20.960]  gets tested because everything has to be tested when it does get a test it'll be tested under that
[20:20.960 --> 20:27.680]  RFID number. There was just another bunch of recalls uh today. Yeah saw that shit ton of
[20:27.680 --> 20:34.320]  recalls. Another hundred thousand plants recalled. Wow. From what dispensary? Into quarantine. I had two of them up in Denver.
[20:34.320 --> 20:41.600]  Two dispensaries in Denver gave product that had whether or not it be PM, pesticides, whatever to
[20:41.600 --> 20:48.640]  to another uh to a bunch of extract companies and it was literally probably almost every extract
[20:48.640 --> 20:55.280]  company like bigger extract company in Denver and they had to return. I only had time to scan that
[20:55.280 --> 21:01.040]  one before today's meeting but yeah the list of stuff that's getting recalled is big. So how does
[21:01.040 --> 21:06.320]  a cannabis recall work? Do they do the customers that purchase it do they bring back their product?
[21:06.320 --> 21:10.720]  No everything that has. They can take it back to the dispensary if they purchased it. It could be their exchange or a refund.
[21:10.720 --> 21:15.280]  All the products have a batch number on it so you they can identify like which batch it is.
[21:15.280 --> 21:22.400]  So if you look on your jar and it has blah blah blah blah blah and hopefully you ain't smoked it all already.
[21:22.400 --> 21:29.040]  Right well that's there's also two lawsuits for people who ingested. Yeah that could be a lot of lawsuits coming
[21:29.040 --> 21:33.120]  around. Yeah but it's going to be years before these people find out if they got sick from any
[21:33.120 --> 21:37.040]  of the things that they smoked and then how can you say that it was this batch of hash right here
[21:37.040 --> 21:41.200]  that got you sick after we've done a million dabs in the past five years. We're the hash test dummies.
[21:41.760 --> 21:46.560]  Yeah we are. That's honestly you're you were kind of kidding but we are the hash test dummies. Any
[21:46.560 --> 21:50.400]  bad things that are coming from this cannabis use the way that we're doing it. They're going to
[21:50.400 --> 21:54.560]  discover them with us. Yeah it'll be our generation and this movement that does discover it. I have to
[21:54.560 --> 22:00.800]  say either way I was extremely happy so that's all that really matters right. I just put down the rest
[22:00.800 --> 22:06.880]  of that pumpkin pie delight bar and it was actually super delightful. I am delighted. There's one piece
[22:06.880 --> 22:10.160]  left I think somebody should. Anybody can have that if we need to crack open more there's a
[22:10.160 --> 22:14.240]  strawberry crunch that I've never tried and I know that the monkey bar is delicious. I only want
[22:14.240 --> 22:20.880]  to eat it because it tastes good. What other reasons do you eat things? Because specifically
[22:20.880 --> 22:28.160]  the medicated bars to medicate. To get me high as shit. I don't need to get any more high but man
[22:28.160 --> 22:32.960]  that thing's tasty. How many milligrams have you had so far? I'm 50 in right now. Oh you're
[22:32.960 --> 22:38.240]  gonna feel it if you're not an edible eater. Oh man I usually save this much for a plane ride.
[22:38.240 --> 22:44.400]  I got some capsules in the car 300 milligram teteva capsules. Oh shit. If you want to have fun.
[22:44.400 --> 22:50.720]  If we want to have fun. I'm not eating them. Maddie just leaned her eyeball into the microphone. Those get me
[22:50.720 --> 22:56.960]  drunk feeling like where I can barely like move my arms and where I sleep for like a solid 12
[22:56.960 --> 23:01.760]  hours when I actually do fall asleep. I can't be doing that. I don't know. I gotta wake up and go to work.
[23:01.840 --> 23:08.640]  12 hours from now. You're gonna be somewhere 12 hours from now. The first time I ate a 100 milligram
[23:08.640 --> 23:15.200]  bar I had to like go lay on the the bed and gather myself. I was like oh my god. Speaking of going to
[23:15.200 --> 23:18.960]  lay down lay down let's give a big shout out to our buddy Jesse. He's not here recording with us
[23:18.960 --> 23:22.320]  tonight because he had shit to handle which is not a problem but let's give him a shout out for the
[23:22.320 --> 23:26.240]  time that he did have to go lay down on the show because he took a fat dab and turned green.
[23:27.120 --> 23:33.440]  Lay down on the couch over there. Yeah big shout out to Jesse. That was that was great. I felt like
[23:33.440 --> 23:37.200]  I killed the man. I felt kind of bad but I was laughing at the same time. He lived through it.
[23:37.200 --> 23:41.520]  He's all right now. We can make fun of him on the show. Maddie's about to take a hit out of the uh
[23:41.520 --> 23:48.320]  the Elevate knockoff uh the fake mothership. The Clinda. See my name's stuck on. I'm glad I called
[23:48.320 --> 23:53.680]  it the Clinda. After that after that we might switch that email over here to the little hit
[23:53.680 --> 23:56.720]  man because it hits a little better in my opinion. It gives you a little meaner rip.
[23:57.840 --> 24:02.880]  Oh that's pretty that's pretty nice. I'm pretty happy. Right for a mothership knockoff. I feel
[24:02.880 --> 24:06.160]  like I did all right. Guys make sure you check out Elevate Glass in Colorado Springs. They do
[24:06.160 --> 24:12.080]  not sponsor the show but they have good glass at reasonable prices. I like I like in one
[24:12.080 --> 24:17.440]  set in like one go you're like you mean that knockoff? Yeah everybody go check out Elevate
[24:17.440 --> 24:22.880]  Glass. It's not a mothership so it wasn't 2,500 bucks and it hits just like a mothership so it
[24:22.880 --> 24:28.160]  was worth the 250 or 200 or whatever it was. For sure it was just it is a knockoff but I mean
[24:28.880 --> 24:33.360]  it's fuck it works the same. It's glass. If you don't know any better you don't know any better.
[24:33.360 --> 24:39.280]  That's a great rig. If you don't know them jeans is Gucci you didn't know. All right I'm gonna
[24:39.280 --> 24:42.800]  take a dab here. I feel those edibles starting to creep up in the back of my brain and I like
[24:42.800 --> 24:48.080]  what's happening. I already started feeling them. I might be high school high. Sloppy your eyes look
[24:48.080 --> 24:54.080]  like high school high. I would have no way of directly telling apart the edible high versus
[24:54.080 --> 25:00.560]  the dab high. I like it. I feel like when I'm on an edible high like my body feels like slouchy.
[25:01.440 --> 25:06.080]  Yeah like my body just feels like. Y'all filled up with sand or something over there? A little of that.
[25:10.160 --> 25:14.400]  You know them weights they put on Samurai Jack? That's where I'm at. Like I'm getting my training
[25:14.640 --> 25:18.960]  Do we need to get you a seat belt for your chair bro? Maybe. I might need to get a cab.
[25:21.200 --> 25:27.360]  I'll get everybody home safely don't worry. Safely. So we saw somebody uh get a DUI on
[25:27.360 --> 25:32.320]  periscope the other day you guys. That is ridiculous. If you were drunk don't drive.
[25:32.320 --> 25:36.720]  And if you were retardedly drunk don't drink and drive and periscope at the same fucking time.
[25:36.720 --> 25:41.040]  These people saw this girl periscoping and driving drunk as hell and they called the cops on her and
[25:41.040 --> 25:46.400]  the cops pulled her over on periscope. You get to see the red and blues pop up and she goes I have
[25:46.400 --> 25:51.440]  to get home and that's the way the video ends. I felt so bad for that young girl but it was kind of
[25:51.440 --> 25:54.880]  funny and kind of sad at the same time. Don't drink and drive you guys. Don't do that. People have to
[25:54.880 --> 25:58.480]  learn their lesson somehow and I'm happy that she didn't learn her lesson by hurting somebody else.
[25:58.480 --> 26:03.280]  That's the truth right? Or herself. Or herself. So at least that officer pulled her over. That's true.
[26:03.280 --> 26:09.280]  Shout out to the periscope people. Periscope police out there. Periscope police. I got a lot of people that
[26:09.280 --> 26:12.640]  follow me on periscope. I'd like to give them all a shout out but I'm sure that I'll skip one so I'm
[26:12.640 --> 26:16.240]  not even going to try. Shout out to everybody. You know who you are. What's up guys? Thanks for joining me.
[26:16.240 --> 26:20.640]  Are there any papers? I would roll a blunt but I know you're not part of the dark side. In that cabinet
[26:20.640 --> 26:26.080]  right in front of you there's a grinder with papers attached to it. Shout out to the oh uh Buzzy's got
[26:26.080 --> 26:34.800]  a cannon rolled already of some Gorilla Glue number four. Yes. Sloppy's got some uh some Nigerian.
[26:34.800 --> 26:40.080]  Some other stuff mixed in. Some other stuff mixed in. This is uh Sloppy just pulled out some Nigerian
[26:40.080 --> 26:46.240]  Nightmare uh what do you guys call that when you roll it around like that? Some moon rocks or caviar.
[26:46.240 --> 26:51.360]  Here grab the mic bro we're gonna ask you some questions. Moon rocks, caviar. Moon rocks or caviar.
[26:51.360 --> 26:58.480]  It's a Nigerian Nightmare is the bud right? Yes. And then what happened to it? Uh and then I took a bunch
[26:58.480 --> 27:05.200]  of oil and put it on a hot plate to get it like melted down and uh liquidy and then I rolled the
[27:05.200 --> 27:12.000]  nug around in it and dropped it in a mason jar full of keef that I got from a pollen box uh
[27:12.720 --> 27:18.000]  and I shook the shit out of it and then now it looks crazy. It looks really crazy. It's hard and
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.560]  crunchy. I checked it out a little bit earlier. Thank you though. Uh so you guys call that caviar
[27:22.560 --> 27:29.280]  or moon rocks? There's a lighter in that same uh. Both. Same thing. No. I was I was like yes right here.
[27:29.280 --> 27:33.360]  Right there. Pow. There you go. The stoner cav. There's all kinds of good good shit in there. There's a grind of
[27:33.360 --> 27:36.160]  their papers in there. There's probably an elf that knows how to roll a joint hidden in there
[27:36.160 --> 27:42.400]  somewhere. Sweet. Yes it's not for sale. I'm keeping the joint rolling elf. I will die with that.
[27:42.400 --> 27:46.640]  That's one of my prized possessions. All right what the fuck are we even talking about? It's episode
[27:46.640 --> 27:50.800]  number 100 you guys. Holy crap we got Spence and Maddie back from the Garden of Weed and they haven't
[27:50.800 --> 27:57.520]  been here in a long freaking time. Did you guys bring the cannabis cup? No it's not a cup. No it's
[27:57.520 --> 28:01.360]  a plaque. It's a plaque you guys. They give them a square plaque. It looks like a bowling trophy now.
[28:01.360 --> 28:08.080]  It's a plaque with a picture of a trophy. Yeah. So it's there in spirit. They probably got tired of
[28:08.080 --> 28:14.320]  making a bunch of cups. You know when they commented on it they said that we didn't enter uh
[28:14.800 --> 28:23.040]  what was it? CBD isn't considered a like a oh it's a high times award not a cannabis cup award.
[28:23.040 --> 28:28.720]  Which so you take the actual medicine and you separate it from all the other things.
[28:30.480 --> 28:35.440]  Isn't it kind of sad? I'm yeah. It's kind of depressed. Yeah that's kind of weird.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.440]  I don't want to I don't want to get quiet like you're like kicking puppies or something.
[28:39.440 --> 28:42.880]  Yeah well that's what it feels like and I don't want to go dissing high times. No not at all.
[28:43.760 --> 28:46.960]  But sometimes it feels like they're doing some sketchy shit sometimes a little bit.
[28:46.960 --> 28:50.480]  Segregation. There's just a lot of stuff behind the scenes that we don't know about.
[28:50.480 --> 28:56.480]  Shout out to Danny Danko for listening to the podcast. Word. Yeah. All right so you guys got
[28:56.480 --> 28:59.440]  I'm gonna say you guys are cup winners. You guys have a cannabis cup. Fuck the rules.
[29:00.080 --> 29:03.280]  You guys won a cannabis cup in my mind. That's a cup. For sure. Yeah.
[29:03.280 --> 29:08.400]  Can you miss plaques? I'm the first black dude to win a cannabis cup. Are you? Are you? Pretty
[29:08.400 --> 29:12.640]  damn close. So so what would the first black guy to win a cannabis cup what would you drink
[29:12.640 --> 29:17.200]  out of the cannabis cup if they had given you a cup? Probably like a 40. A 40 just pour a 40.
[29:17.200 --> 29:23.200]  OE 800. Yeah. That's my boy right there. That's what I would drink. Spencer's definitely the
[29:23.200 --> 29:28.560]  first black guy to win the secret cup though. Oh yeah for sure. I was there for that one too. That
[29:28.560 --> 29:31.360]  was pretty awesome. Maddie if you would have brought home a cannabis cup what would have been
[29:31.360 --> 29:37.660]  the first thing you would have drank out of a cannabis cup? You could say it. Don't look all shy.
[29:38.220 --> 29:42.620]  Uh I don't know I probably would have put like a stupid margarita or something in there. That
[29:42.620 --> 29:47.100]  sounds good. Or maybe a smoothie. Your homies pouring a fucking 40 in there. You can put a
[29:47.100 --> 29:51.580]  margarita or a smoothie in there. We already know what Mike would drink out of a cannabis cup. Mike
[29:51.580 --> 29:55.500]  would drink a Mountain Dew out of that sucker right away. Do for Mountain Dew. Fill it up with
[29:55.500 --> 29:58.860]  Mountain Dew. Fill it out with that Dew. Slop's got the mic. What would you drink out of your
[29:58.860 --> 30:02.700]  cannabis cup bro? Can we be totally up? You whatever you want bro. It's your own cannabis
[30:02.700 --> 30:09.660]  cup. You got to clean it. Liquid acid would be appropriate. He's going hard on this motherfucker.
[30:09.660 --> 30:14.060]  You guys I do not condone or recommend you drinking a cannabis cup filled with liquid acid.
[30:14.060 --> 30:18.860]  That sounds like a horrible time. The 40 would do you just nice. Yeah yeah maybe put your finger in
[30:18.860 --> 30:23.660]  the acid and then fill it up with some grape juice or something. Sprite with a couple drops of
[30:23.660 --> 30:29.180]  liquid acid. That sounds a little bit better. All right pass the mic over there to our homie Buzzy.
[30:29.180 --> 30:32.540]  Mr. Buzzy if you want a cannabis cup right now and you could fill it up with anything and take a
[30:32.540 --> 30:38.860]  drink. I mean I have an answer but it only makes sense to a few people. It would have to be a kale
[30:38.860 --> 30:46.700]  shake. I thought it was either kale shake or like Starbucks drink for me. Oh man. A giant frozen
[30:47.260 --> 30:52.700]  mocha drink that would be amazing. A frosted cup. A mocha frappuccino and that would be great.
[30:52.700 --> 30:58.860]  A mocha frappuccino and a cannabis cup. That's why we all don't have cannabis cups because they
[30:58.860 --> 31:03.580]  know we'll just be filling them up with lean and drinking out of them. They were like oh we're
[31:03.580 --> 31:07.740]  just going to give this boy a few to his lack. He doesn't need a cup. Right right. No one.
[31:07.820 --> 31:13.340]  Some pictures of 40s. No one's going to steal his plaque. I wish you would have had your grill when
[31:13.340 --> 31:17.820]  you won the cannabis cup. Sorry I mentioned the grill. Hey if anybody finds Spencer's grill.
[31:17.820 --> 31:24.620]  Yeah if anybody knows where it's at holler at me. I need that. It was expensive. You can send it to my PO box. We'll get you the address.
[31:24.620 --> 31:28.380]  That'd be awesome. I appreciate it. I'm gonna hit this joint of Gorilla Glue because it smells delicious.
[31:28.380 --> 31:34.940]  It's tasty too. This is this is great. 100th episode you're smoking flowers. Smoking flowers. I've had
[31:34.940 --> 31:44.220]  this dab in my head for like 10 minutes. Joint my friend. Pro dabinating. I was just reading an article. I'm sure you guys have all heard that they're releasing like 6,000.
[31:44.220 --> 31:49.100]  Get on the mic just a little tiny. Yeah there you go. Yeah there you go. Yeah. Oh did you hear me? Non-violent
[31:49.100 --> 31:54.940]  criminals. Non-violent criminals from prisons. You know overcrowding. Nice. I think that's awesome.
[31:54.940 --> 31:59.900]  So they should just let out all the weed people first. Yeah I was gonna say what's non-violent.
[31:59.900 --> 32:04.060]  Like criminals and some of them weren't even convicted but they've been in there for years.
[32:05.020 --> 32:13.260]  Yeah just waiting. Another positive step. Yep. Yo. One step closer. Yeah I knew this dude that was a
[32:13.260 --> 32:21.340]  marine and he came back and he got assaulted and like put the dude in a coma and they put him in
[32:21.340 --> 32:26.940]  jail and he was in county jail like throughout trial and stuff for like a year and a half. Damn
[32:26.940 --> 32:31.420]  before he even got processed through. Yeah. Is the trial over yet? I don't know. I didn't keep up
[32:31.420 --> 32:36.380]  with him. Okay. It was just somebody that I knew through involvement. Rough life. Yeah I can't
[32:36.380 --> 32:41.260]  believe that. So I just took a fat hit off a joint and then I took a little decent sized dab of some
[32:41.260 --> 32:46.460]  live resin and uh I'm I'm a high as giraffe pussy and I'm liking it. This is gonna be a fun episode
[32:46.460 --> 32:51.100]  you guys. Holy crap. I may need a seat belt for my chair before we go too far here. Mike you're
[32:51.100 --> 32:54.860]  quiet over there. What's on your mind homie? I'm nice and high. This is fun. Nice. Mike showed up
[32:54.940 --> 33:01.180]  and the first thing we did was make sure we give him some dabs. Yeah. Uh when when Slop said the uh
[33:01.180 --> 33:07.100]  bowl of acid it made me think of did you happen to see the acid church that happened on Sunday?
[33:07.100 --> 33:13.100]  I oh yes. On Joey Diaz's. Anybody who listens to that out there? It's a like church where you take
[33:13.100 --> 33:16.540]  acid? Well actually these guys have a podcast called the church of what's happening now. It's
[33:16.540 --> 33:21.420]  one of my favorite podcasts. I'll give him a shout out. It's Joey Diaz and Lee Syatt but uh Joey Diaz,
[33:21.420 --> 33:26.220]  Lee Syatt, and Ari Shafir uh went on the podcast and they ate acid together. With Eddie Bravo. With
[33:26.220 --> 33:30.300]  Eddie Bravo. Uh yeah Eddie Bravo did not eat acid. He wanted to be very clear that he was not eating
[33:30.300 --> 33:35.500]  acid so uh the other three ate uh nice dose acid and they were tripping. They were tripping face.
[33:35.500 --> 33:40.060]  They were giggling and then they went on periscope a little bit later and periscoped themselves all
[33:40.060 --> 33:44.860]  tripping and Ari Shafir was laying on the floor rubbing his head. Lee Syatt was smiling the size
[33:44.860 --> 33:50.540]  of the moon and Joey Diaz did not seem phased at all by all the drugs that they had taken. He was
[33:50.540 --> 33:55.820]  sitting there eating 500 milligram stars uh stars of death. The gummy bears. Gummy stars. Just eating
[33:55.820 --> 33:59.900]  them like they were candy. He's like they kind of take the edge off dog. That's all he was thinking.
[33:59.900 --> 34:05.500]  Like they take the edge off. You guys we won't ever eat acid on this podcast you guys. That's
[34:05.500 --> 34:10.380]  not gonna happen. I might. I might. Well maybe. I might just come to the end. I might just pop
[34:10.380 --> 34:14.380]  something and come. I'll be real entertaining that night. Pulling my drink a little bit closer to me
[34:14.380 --> 34:19.420]  as everyone's talking about Mike's looking down at his mountain dew like I'm not sure if I want to
[34:19.420 --> 34:24.140]  eat anymore. Did I leave the room while these were open? You did. You went pee a minute ago. It could be a fun
[34:24.140 --> 34:27.980]  night. It could be a fun night for everybody huh. So if we start talking about colors and shit you
[34:27.980 --> 34:32.620]  guys it's because somebody in this room just fed us a bunch of acid. Yeah or Pixar movies. You gotta
[34:32.620 --> 34:40.460]  start bringing up Pixar movies. Do you like Pixar movies Sloppy? Are you a Minions fan? Yo.
[34:41.420 --> 34:47.660]  If you ever if your first time taking acid pop in a nice Pixar movie. My first time taking acid I
[34:47.660 --> 34:51.100]  might have taken a little bit too much from what I remember. I was with the greatest people to be
[34:51.100 --> 34:57.420]  ever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You always feel like you're taking too much. What's the biggest dab you've
[34:57.420 --> 35:05.420]  ever taken Sloppy? Um I'm pretty sure our friend Michael gave me like a gram dab once. Nice. I did
[35:05.420 --> 35:11.660]  a gram at the the Cannabis Cup and won a t-shirt and I almost threw up. Almost threw up. I've almost
[35:11.660 --> 35:16.540]  thrown up both times. The one time uh that Michael did it was during the Super Bowl and I literally
[35:16.540 --> 35:20.860]  took the dab stood up in the middle of his house took my shirt off and lay down on the floor.
[35:21.980 --> 35:26.060]  And I'm pretty sure I took a nap. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes you just need a little rest after a
[35:26.060 --> 35:31.900]  big dab like that. I think that if there were to be a dab contest in the room I think the last two
[35:31.900 --> 35:37.820]  standers would probably be myself and Matty. I'll be the first person out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Spence
[35:37.820 --> 35:42.300]  has no uh no shame in saying he does not take big dabs. He likes to take a whole bunch of little dabs
[35:42.780 --> 35:45.660]  and then his eyes turn as red as stoplights.
[35:47.740 --> 35:51.820]  He just he looked into the microphone and nodded like the microphone could hear the nod. Yep.
[35:51.820 --> 35:56.780]  Yep. You high over there my friend? Yep. What was the other podcast you were on? Do you know the name?
[35:57.340 --> 36:01.660]  Cannabis Network Radio. Cannabis Network Radio. It's like the world's best weed podcast. The best
[36:01.660 --> 36:05.500]  weed show ever. The best weed show ever. Shout out to those guys. I'm working on getting myself
[36:05.500 --> 36:08.940]  booked for that show. We're gonna be on there one time. That's gonna be awesome. Yeah. Yeah. What
[36:08.940 --> 36:13.260]  up Jason? All that. That whole crew. What up Hunt? Hey Hunt I hope you're listening. Shout out to
[36:13.260 --> 36:17.660]  Damsel. Just random shout outs because we're at that point. Yeah. I feel the edible's kicking in
[36:17.660 --> 36:21.980]  obviously. Do we need to open another one of these you guys or is everybody uh edible-ied?
[36:21.980 --> 36:28.700]  Matty just gave the if there's that emoji with the little chip you guys off the cross out. If you opened it I would eat it.
[36:28.700 --> 36:35.260]  I'm with whatever you're with. We should not open it because we will eat it. Buzzy finally came in for
[36:35.260 --> 36:38.540]  the last piece. I knew that was gonna happen. I've been waiting patiently for that. I think
[36:39.420 --> 36:45.660]  I think it's uh it's you know I eat edibles once every six months and we might as well do it right.
[36:45.660 --> 36:49.980]  You got a big old smile on your face Sloppy. I haven't seen you that smile in quite a while. I'm
[36:49.980 --> 36:53.820]  pretty happy. Yeah. It's good to be in a room full of healthy people that are taking good care of
[36:53.820 --> 36:59.020]  themselves. We're not a bunch of lazy ass potheads. These are a group of people that freaking do work.
[36:59.020 --> 37:05.100]  Spence can hoop. Spence play some ball. Yeah. Can you dunk on some fools? Yeah. He just smiles and
[37:05.100 --> 37:09.100]  nods like uh-huh. I have dunked on some fools. The tallest dude I ever dunked on was like
[37:09.900 --> 37:17.340]  he's like 6'9". Damn. He was huge but he wasn't like 6'9 and like could jump out of the gym. He
[37:17.340 --> 37:24.380]  was like 6'9 and just giant. Glued to the ground pretty much. Yeah. But he was he could dunk because
[37:24.940 --> 37:31.340]  he was 6'9". Yeah. But you could bench up and stuff it on him. How many times have you smacked a dude in
[37:31.340 --> 37:37.740]  the face with your nuts? Just be honest. Zero times. That's never happened. I see it on YouTube all the
[37:37.740 --> 37:41.740]  time. People dunking is like the most shameful way to dunk on somebody. I thought you meant like really
[37:41.740 --> 37:46.060]  take it by force. Oh no. Not like team bagging in like sixth grade or nothing. I'm talking about like dunking.
[37:46.060 --> 37:52.620]  I've got. When I was like in 10th grade or the summer before my 10th grade we were playing in a
[37:52.620 --> 37:58.540]  basketball tournament and I literally caught a ball took two steps and jumped over a kid that was
[37:58.540 --> 38:03.100]  like I mean it's probably only like six foot but like I'm in 10th grade I literally just Vince
[38:03.100 --> 38:09.980]  Carter'd over this dude. Like the referees were like alumni players. Players who'd just come back
[38:09.980 --> 38:16.140]  for summer for money and literally they just take off running out of the gym. The referees are like
[38:16.140 --> 38:23.500]  holy shit he just jumped over somebody. That's so funny. But that was cool. I was really athletic but I
[38:23.500 --> 38:28.380]  think I'm uh I always liked weed. It was never like besides when I was younger it was the only
[38:28.380 --> 38:33.180]  time I didn't really smoke but once I got into like high school and like college I continued to
[38:33.180 --> 38:37.580]  smoke. I had two scholarships and I was still smoking weed. Can you hoop when you're high? Yeah I play I
[38:37.580 --> 38:42.140]  think I play better when I'm high. It slows down. Yeah. It's not so fast. As a musician that's. I don't know
[38:42.220 --> 38:48.220]  sometime it might be I'm slowed down. But you can shoot better right? It's a little more aim a little
[38:48.220 --> 38:52.380]  like you get normally time is going by about tick tick tick but when you smoke some weed you get
[38:52.380 --> 38:58.300]  that tick tick tick and when you're playing music I'll take a hit of that why not. Let's smoke some
[38:58.300 --> 39:06.540]  flowers when there's flowers around. Thank you Joe. Not going to go bad for trying to skip you. But now I got to pass it. Now you're back to the where this joint goes game.
[39:06.940 --> 39:18.780]  But as a musician when you're playing music you can just feel the time so much better when you're a little high. It feels like that beat is so much thicker like you got so much more room to play with that time that's coming by as a musician. I love it.
[39:19.580 --> 39:26.460]  Slop's nodding his head. You like to rap when you're all high sloppy? Oh I probably smoke a blunt perverse.
[39:27.420 --> 39:36.460]  Perverse. All right Snoop Dizzle. Uh it just works out that way. Well I won't I'll put it out and do some rap and spark it back up and stuff. It's not like the whole time I
[39:36.940 --> 39:41.340]  The blunt doesn't fuck up your throat. I mean I sound all right right? You sound good buddy.
[39:42.700 --> 39:55.260]  I mean yo I was gonna say a second ago when y'all were like I love weed yo we we should all discuss like uh when we first smoked weed it's the 100th episode like what brought us to this community you know what was that first
[39:55.820 --> 40:01.500]  Well it's here at sloppy when's the first time you smoked weed since you're putting us on this I'll go with this I like it. We're gonna put you on the spotlight first.
[40:01.580 --> 40:17.420]  The first time I ever smoked weed was walking home from school. I was in fifth grade. My school was a fifth grade through 12th grade in one school because the community was small and I didn't really know what the big kids were doing but they asked me if I wanted to smoke and I said yes.
[40:17.980 --> 40:24.860]  And I went to my friend Demetrius's house and we went to his shed and played Sega Genesis and smoked blunts while his grandma cooked us chicken.
[40:25.180 --> 40:29.980]  And uh I remember it was chicken. That shit just sounded like a Chappelle show.
[40:31.420 --> 40:39.900]  It was shitlands to be specific and it was the first time I had ever seen or smelled them and I was horrible. They're horrible horrible.
[40:39.900 --> 40:50.060]  Can you remember what game you were playing? You gotta put those outside. Can you remember what game you were playing? We were playing Golden Axe. Alright. It's uh one of the first co-op games on Sega Genesis and we used to sit in that shed and do it all the time.
[40:50.220 --> 41:02.780]  And it was funny because I was so young that I didn't know what I did was wrong until I was about to leave when my mom pulled up and they're like alright don't eat anything when you get home and go in your room and tell your mom you have a headache.
[41:02.780 --> 41:10.300]  And I was like oh this seems weird like you know but that was every day and eventually my mom was like why do you have so many headaches?
[41:10.300 --> 41:18.540]  I read you're laughing a lot. Life is too good. What's wrong with you? You seem to be enjoying yourself. So you didn't even know that you were doing something bad?
[41:19.100 --> 41:33.100]  Uh I mean my mom smoked cigarettes when I was younger so I saw people smoking but nah I was just like I wanted to be a cool kid. It was 5th through 12th grade. I was there with all older kids. It was a minority school.
[41:33.100 --> 41:43.180]  Uh I got integrated into so it was just like you know being the oddball out I was like well that's what they're doing let's do it. And then I did it and played those video games and I was like this is the shit.
[41:43.340 --> 41:46.540]  And I have been playing video games and smoking weed since that day.
[41:46.540 --> 41:48.540]  Weed and video games go together so damn well.
[41:48.540 --> 41:50.540]  Going to a whole new level.
[41:50.540 --> 41:55.660]  Nice. Does anybody else want to tell about the first time they got high? You don't have to if you don't want to Joe.
[41:55.660 --> 41:57.660]  I want to hear it.
[41:57.660 --> 41:59.660]  Do it if you want to. Let's hear it.
[41:59.660 --> 42:09.900]  Uh it's a pretty basic story. I was interested in it. I was hanging out with friends one day. Some people came with weed. Got smoked and I was like okay this is interesting. I can see why people enjoy this.
[42:10.620 --> 42:12.620]  And uh just kind of have ever since.
[42:12.620 --> 42:14.620]  How old were you if you don't mind me asking?
[42:14.620 --> 42:16.620]  Uh I guess 17.
[42:16.620 --> 42:18.620]  Okay.
[42:18.620 --> 42:20.620]  That seems about an appropriate age to start smoking.
[42:20.620 --> 42:27.580]  But it wasn't like the first year. It was really sporadic. Just like here and there. It was just like a curiosity.
[42:27.580 --> 42:29.580]  Okay.
[42:29.580 --> 42:38.060]  It got settled and then after that I became interested in like more than just weed as a cool after school activity.
[42:38.220 --> 42:40.220]  Haha. So some other things took its place.
[42:40.220 --> 42:42.220]  Uh I guess so.
[42:42.220 --> 42:44.220]  Okay.
[42:44.220 --> 42:46.220]  But uh yeah that's all for that.
[42:46.220 --> 42:48.220]  That's all for that. I can tell by the look on your face not to go further with that question.
[42:48.220 --> 42:55.020]  Miss Maddie do you want to tell us about the first time that you got to experience and play with the wonderful world of ganja and cannabis?
[42:55.020 --> 43:03.020]  I was really really young. I can't really say my story on a podcast because I'm afraid that uh might not go so well.
[43:03.980 --> 43:09.980]  But I was really young. I was like 13 when I like started smoking weed like once or twice a week.
[43:09.980 --> 43:11.980]  Yeah.
[43:11.980 --> 43:13.980]  11.
[43:13.980 --> 43:17.980]  Spencer just pointed out that Sophie said 5th grade and Maddie's afraid to tell her story.
[43:17.980 --> 43:19.980]  No I was not afraid.
[43:19.980 --> 43:21.980]  I think I know why.
[43:21.980 --> 43:23.980]  Yeah. Out of respect.
[43:23.980 --> 43:25.980]  Word. Alright. So how old were you?
[43:25.980 --> 43:27.980]  I was young. I was like 13 when I started.
[43:27.980 --> 43:29.980]  I probably smoked weed before that.
[43:29.980 --> 43:31.980]  I started smoking cigarettes and stuff.
[43:32.940 --> 43:36.940]  I grew up in like a trailer park so you know it was kind of like around the edges.
[43:36.940 --> 43:38.940]  If you live in a trailer park you smoke cigarettes at 11.
[43:38.940 --> 43:44.940]  I started smoking and drinking really really young so when weed was introduced to me it wasn't even like a question.
[43:44.940 --> 43:46.940]  I thought it was just something normal.
[43:46.940 --> 43:48.940]  Started at the trailer and now you're here.
[43:48.940 --> 43:52.940]  Yeah. Almost just like Sophie. Like just didn't really realize what I was doing was wrong.
[43:52.940 --> 43:58.940]  And then I remember one day I sat in a DARE class because in North Carolina you have to go through DARE classes which is a drug awareness class.
[43:59.900 --> 44:01.900]  Drug Abuse Resistance Education.
[44:01.900 --> 44:03.900]  There we go.
[44:03.900 --> 44:07.900]  And they were talking about marijuana and they were saying how awful it was.
[44:07.900 --> 44:09.900]  Alright Nancy Grace over there.
[44:09.900 --> 44:11.900]  Marijuana.
[44:11.900 --> 44:17.900]  Yeah so I just remember that and I was like oh shit man maybe that stuff is bad but it's good.
[44:17.900 --> 44:21.900]  I was already hooked by the time I got into DARE.
[44:21.900 --> 44:23.900]  Alright Spence you know you're up next.
[44:23.900 --> 44:27.900]  When's the first time you, what do you remember about the first time you smoked some weed?
[44:28.860 --> 44:32.860]  I smoked weed out of like a Sprite bottle when I was in like 9th grade.
[44:32.860 --> 44:38.860]  I didn't even know what getting high was so I didn't know what I was feeling.
[44:38.860 --> 44:40.860]  I was like I guess I'm high I don't know.
[44:40.860 --> 44:46.860]  And then I didn't really touch weed until I was like maybe sophomore.
[44:46.860 --> 44:48.860]  The next year is when I was actually smoking.
[44:48.860 --> 44:54.860]  Not like every day but two or three times a week I guess.
[44:55.820 --> 44:57.820]  Whenever someone's got some weed whenever it comes up Friday night or whatever.
[44:57.820 --> 45:03.820]  I think my interest changed when I found out about GoodWeed.
[45:03.820 --> 45:09.820]  When I first saw like, cause everybody remembers Reggie, like you smoked Reggie.
[45:09.820 --> 45:11.820]  Yeah you start off with that shitty brick weed.
[45:11.820 --> 45:15.820]  Yeah then you see GoodWeed and it completely like changes your mind.
[45:15.820 --> 45:17.820]  It's like holy shit I'll never smoke that again.
[45:17.820 --> 45:19.820]  So weed is how you two started dating?
[45:19.820 --> 45:23.820]  Yeah he had really really good weed and we had a mutual friend.
[45:24.780 --> 45:26.780]  In North Carolina where we lived at the time it was really hard to find weed.
[45:26.780 --> 45:30.780]  So I got some from him and it was like super super good.
[45:30.780 --> 45:32.780]  It was the best weed I'd ever seen.
[45:32.780 --> 45:34.780]  Like me and my friend were freaking out.
[45:34.780 --> 45:36.780]  We started smoking it and we were just giggling.
[45:36.780 --> 45:38.780]  Did you grow that weed Spence?
[45:38.780 --> 45:40.780]  No.
[45:40.780 --> 45:42.780]  It wasn't it was just like some really good stuff for where we were at.
[45:42.780 --> 45:44.780]  And we just started hanging out after that.
[45:44.780 --> 45:46.780]  But that weed put you two together.
[45:46.780 --> 45:48.780]  Yep.
[45:48.780 --> 45:50.780]  How cute.
[45:50.780 --> 45:52.780]  If he probably had bad weed I don't know.
[45:53.740 --> 45:55.740]  That GoodWeed got you a good girl bro.
[45:55.740 --> 45:57.740]  Nice work.
[45:57.740 --> 45:59.740]  Alright Mike we're gonna shift over to you bro.
[45:59.740 --> 46:01.740]  When's the first time you ever smoked some weed?
[46:01.740 --> 46:05.740]  Well we thought we were smoking weed when we were like 12 or 13.
[46:05.740 --> 46:09.740]  But now it was either the worst ditch weed ever.
[46:09.740 --> 46:13.740]  Or more than likely it was just what some older kids had sold us as weed.
[46:13.740 --> 46:17.740]  And it was actually mostly tobacco and like some oregano.
[46:17.740 --> 46:19.740]  Or something.
[46:19.740 --> 46:21.740]  Punk ass motherfuckers.
[46:22.700 --> 46:26.700]  The first time I got like really high a friend of mine after school when I was like 15.
[46:26.700 --> 46:28.700]  Was like hey you want to go smoke?
[46:28.700 --> 46:30.700]  And I was like sure.
[46:30.700 --> 46:32.700]  And I thought they meant cigarettes.
[46:32.700 --> 46:34.700]  And we got in her car and drove off.
[46:34.700 --> 46:36.700]  And I was like this is kind of ridiculous.
[46:36.700 --> 46:38.700]  I thought we were gonna go around the block.
[46:38.700 --> 46:40.700]  What the hell is happening?
[46:40.700 --> 46:42.700]  And she blocked away.
[46:42.700 --> 46:44.700]  And we went to her garage and got stoned.
[46:44.700 --> 46:46.700]  And it was the first time I'd ever smoked GoodWeed.
[46:46.700 --> 46:48.700]  We called it red hair.
[46:48.700 --> 46:50.700]  Which I think is yeah now that I know it.
[46:51.660 --> 46:53.660]  What I know about marijuana.
[46:53.660 --> 46:55.660]  We had no fucking clue what we were doing.
[46:55.660 --> 46:57.660]  We were just happy to have weed that was good.
[46:57.660 --> 46:59.660]  And I was stoned out of my mind.
[46:59.660 --> 47:01.660]  And by this point in my life.
[47:01.660 --> 47:07.660]  I had sat through dozens of hours of anti-drug education propaganda nonsense.
[47:07.660 --> 47:09.660]  And so when I finally got dropped off at my house.
[47:09.660 --> 47:13.660]  I made it inside and flopped down in the guest bedroom.
[47:13.660 --> 47:15.660]  Thinking that I was gonna die.
[47:15.660 --> 47:19.660]  And that my mom was gonna be one of those sad ass moms that goes to middle school.
[47:20.620 --> 47:22.620]  And was like my son started smoking marijuana.
[47:22.620 --> 47:26.620]  And then died like 10 years later after a horrible run of addiction.
[47:26.620 --> 47:28.620]  So don't do drugs kids.
[47:28.620 --> 47:32.620]  And then I woke up 3 hours later hungry as shit.
[47:32.620 --> 47:36.620]  But that's the first time I got really good and stoned.
[47:38.620 --> 47:40.620]  I got more high as you were telling that story.
[47:40.620 --> 47:42.620]  I was noticing that my edibles are working.
[47:42.620 --> 47:44.620]  They're definitely working.
[47:44.620 --> 47:46.620]  I'm 120 milligrams deep and I can feel it.
[47:46.620 --> 47:48.620]  So now you've got your own little guy Mike.
[47:49.580 --> 47:51.580]  You've got your own little kid right?
[47:51.580 --> 47:53.580]  I do.
[47:53.580 --> 47:55.580]  How old would you prefer him to wait?
[47:55.580 --> 47:57.580]  I mean he's only pint sized now you guys.
[47:57.580 --> 47:59.580]  His water bottle is taller than Davey.
[47:59.580 --> 48:01.580]  At least late teens.
[48:01.580 --> 48:03.580]  Late teens okay.
[48:03.580 --> 48:05.580]  Just like let the brain finish developing.
[48:05.580 --> 48:07.580]  I wish I would have waited another couple of years.
[48:07.580 --> 48:09.580]  Me too.
[48:09.580 --> 48:11.580]  Mainly for the lungs.
[48:11.580 --> 48:13.580]  But if I could go back and not do something it would be not tobacco.
[48:13.580 --> 48:15.580]  Yeah bro you smoke way too many cigarettes.
[48:15.580 --> 48:17.580]  I do.
[48:18.540 --> 48:20.540]  But yeah wait until the late teens.
[48:20.540 --> 48:22.540]  Let your brain finish growing.
[48:22.540 --> 48:24.540]  Learn all the shit they're trying to teach you in high school.
[48:24.540 --> 48:26.540]  Okay.
[48:26.540 --> 48:28.540]  So like how do you feel if he's in like sophomore year,
[48:28.540 --> 48:30.540]  junior year and he's killing it with the grades.
[48:30.540 --> 48:32.540]  He's doing whatever.
[48:32.540 --> 48:34.540]  He's got a good job.
[48:34.540 --> 48:36.540]  Dude it's all about meeting your responsibilities.
[48:36.540 --> 48:38.540]  Alright.
[48:38.540 --> 48:40.540]  So then as long as he's going to work at Village Inn on time
[48:40.540 --> 48:42.540]  or whatever he's doing and he's playing his guitar
[48:42.540 --> 48:44.540]  and doing his guitar lessons like he's supposed to
[48:44.540 --> 48:46.540]  and his grades are good.
[48:46.540 --> 48:48.540]  He's like 20 years old.
[48:48.540 --> 48:50.540]  Oh yeah you better make sure you're smoking good shit too.
[48:50.540 --> 48:52.540]  You can't be smoking mid-grade in Mike's house.
[48:52.540 --> 48:54.540]  Quality control.
[48:54.540 --> 48:56.540]  But he'd still get in trouble for it and shit
[48:56.540 --> 48:58.540]  until he was out of my house.
[48:58.540 --> 49:00.540]  I wouldn't freak out if I found out
[49:00.540 --> 49:02.540]  my teenager was getting stoned.
[49:02.540 --> 49:04.540]  Joe it looks like you got something to say.
[49:04.540 --> 49:06.540]  You just grabbed the mic.
[49:06.540 --> 49:08.540]  Oh yeah I was going to wait.
[49:08.540 --> 49:10.540]  But uh
[49:10.540 --> 49:12.540]  yeah you should explain yours first before I
[49:12.540 --> 49:14.540]  totally change my mind.
[49:14.540 --> 49:16.540]  I was coming out the womb smoking a joint.
[49:16.540 --> 49:18.540]  Yeah man I was born with a big ass rig.
[49:22.540 --> 49:24.540]  Unfortunately I had a couple
[49:24.540 --> 49:26.540]  I had three uncles who were pot smoking assholes
[49:26.540 --> 49:28.540]  the whole time I was growing up.
[49:28.540 --> 49:30.540]  So I grew up with
[49:30.540 --> 49:32.540]  I have an uncle Eric. Shout out uncle Eric bro.
[49:32.540 --> 49:34.540]  You don't listen to the show but shout out bro. Much love.
[49:34.540 --> 49:36.540]  I am kind of a clone of him.
[49:36.540 --> 49:38.540]  I grew up to become very much like him.
[49:38.540 --> 49:40.540]  I would hang out with him all the time.
[49:40.540 --> 49:42.540]  My uncles Rontra and Eric would hang out
[49:42.540 --> 49:44.540]  and smoke. They had a bong that was the color
[49:44.540 --> 49:46.540]  remember those old school 70s bongs
[49:46.540 --> 49:48.540]  it looks like it's pistol grip in the front it's got a carb up here
[49:48.540 --> 49:50.540]  by your thumb. The bowl comes out of the middle
[49:50.540 --> 49:52.540]  and then it's got like a dick mouthpiece that comes off
[49:52.540 --> 49:54.540]  of it and it's funky shaped looks like it was made in ceramics
[49:54.540 --> 49:56.540]  class. They would sit in a room
[49:56.540 --> 49:58.540]  and just smoke out of that fucking bong all the time.
[49:58.540 --> 50:00.540]  It was that like weird shitty ceramic
[50:00.540 --> 50:02.540]  shiny glass looking thing.
[50:02.540 --> 50:04.540]  And they had to babysit me all the time.
[50:04.540 --> 50:06.540]  And so hanging out in that room
[50:06.540 --> 50:08.540]  I got stoned as fuck as a
[50:08.540 --> 50:10.540]  little kid but I didn't realize that's what was happening.
[50:10.540 --> 50:12.540]  I was just like wow.
[50:12.540 --> 50:14.540]  I just knew something was weird.
[50:14.540 --> 50:16.540]  And then they took me to a
[50:16.540 --> 50:18.540]  concert. My uncles Eric
[50:18.540 --> 50:20.540]  and Ron took me
[50:20.540 --> 50:22.540]  to a concert. I won't even say the name of the band
[50:22.540 --> 50:24.540]  because it was some cheesy hair bands
[50:24.540 --> 50:26.540]  but it was cool. I got to go with my uncles
[50:26.540 --> 50:28.540]  and it was in Long Beach in California.
[50:28.540 --> 50:30.540]  So we were in an El Camino. It's like a
[50:30.540 --> 50:32.540]  small truck and they were in the front and I was in the
[50:32.540 --> 50:34.540]  back and they decided to smoke a
[50:34.540 --> 50:36.540]  joint on the way and play
[50:36.540 --> 50:38.540]  the Black Album from Metallica.
[50:38.540 --> 50:40.540]  And that was a life changing drive.
[50:40.540 --> 50:42.540]  That's what made me a drummer. That's part of what
[50:42.540 --> 50:44.540]  made me a pothead. I got so
[50:44.540 --> 50:46.540]  stoned from the joint they smoked. All the smoke
[50:46.540 --> 50:48.540]  blew right in the back of the fucking vehicle.
[50:48.540 --> 50:50.540]  And I was just sitting there just cheefed
[50:50.540 --> 50:52.540]  and they knew it too. They were laughing at me.
[50:52.540 --> 50:54.540]  They were like, you got high. And I was like, I'm
[50:54.540 --> 50:56.540]  fucking high bro. Like official
[50:56.540 --> 50:58.540]  high. But I never hit the joint.
[50:58.540 --> 51:00.540]  And they played that Black Album from Metallica
[51:00.540 --> 51:02.540]  and by the time we got back I was already
[51:02.540 --> 51:04.540]  figuring out how I was going to go buy that album the next
[51:04.540 --> 51:06.540]  day. I was like, I'm a Metallica head and I want
[51:06.540 --> 51:08.540]  to get high all the time. This is what I love.
[51:08.540 --> 51:10.540]  And so... This is life.
[51:10.540 --> 51:12.540]  Yeah. Yeah. That just
[51:12.540 --> 51:14.540]  changed some shit. And then shortly after that my friend
[51:14.540 --> 51:16.540]  Chris Ruth smoked me out and got me stupid
[51:16.540 --> 51:18.540]  high. And we were in
[51:18.540 --> 51:20.540]  the parking lot of my elementary school.
[51:20.540 --> 51:22.540]  I wasn't in elementary school anymore at this time.
[51:22.540 --> 51:24.540]  I was an adult by now. Smoked
[51:24.540 --> 51:26.540]  a joint or a bowl with
[51:26.540 --> 51:28.540]  my buddy Chris Ruth. Probably, probably
[51:28.540 --> 51:30.540]  how old was I? I'm going to say
[51:30.540 --> 51:32.540]  7th grade because I left California
[51:32.540 --> 51:34.540]  before 9th grade, before 10th grade.
[51:34.540 --> 51:36.540]  How old was I? It was about 7th grade when I first
[51:36.540 --> 51:38.540]  smoked weed with Chris Ruth. And I didn't smoke
[51:38.540 --> 51:40.540]  for a long time. I didn't... He would get me so
[51:40.540 --> 51:42.540]  high that I didn't like it. It was too much.
[51:42.540 --> 51:44.540]  Like, he was trying to... He thought
[51:44.540 --> 51:46.540]  it was funny but he would get me so fucking high that I
[51:46.540 --> 51:48.540]  didn't even enjoy it. So I
[51:48.540 --> 51:50.540]  came out here and then I met up with some friends
[51:50.540 --> 51:52.540]  and they were smoking a bowl. And I was
[51:52.540 --> 51:54.540]  like, oh man, I remember that. And I took a hit off
[51:54.540 --> 51:56.540]  of it and I didn't get stupid high because they were smoking
[51:56.540 --> 51:58.540]  mids. And Callie, they were smoking good weed. And I heard they were smoking
[51:58.540 --> 52:00.540]  shitty weed. So I could smoke that.
[52:00.540 --> 52:02.540]  So I got some training wheels and I learned how to really smoke
[52:02.540 --> 52:04.540]  good weed. And now I'm a fucking
[52:04.540 --> 52:06.540]  dab monster.
[52:06.540 --> 52:08.540]  I want to take a fat dab. I'm really high
[52:08.540 --> 52:10.540]  but I want to take a fat dab because this is episode
[52:10.540 --> 52:12.540]  100, you guys.
[52:12.540 --> 52:14.540]  Let's take a dab of some
[52:14.540 --> 52:16.540]  Gorilla Glue.
[52:16.540 --> 52:18.540]  This slab is vanishing
[52:18.540 --> 52:20.540]  rapidly. I've been dabbing the shit out of this. This
[52:20.540 --> 52:22.540]  was... Who grew this?
[52:22.540 --> 52:24.540]  We did. We did. Team Weeden
[52:24.540 --> 52:26.540]  grew this. Team Weeden extracted it. Shout out to team Weeden.
[52:26.540 --> 52:28.540]  There's a lot of stuff that I don't really...
[52:28.540 --> 52:30.540]  If anything, it's from us. It's
[52:30.540 --> 52:32.540]  most like 90%
[52:32.540 --> 52:34.540]  of it's grown. 90%? Yeah, you guys brought some
[52:34.540 --> 52:36.540]  sour diesel live resin
[52:36.540 --> 52:38.540]  that is just some fire. And I don't know what this live is
[52:38.540 --> 52:40.540]  you gave me the other day but holy shit, that one's tasty.
[52:40.540 --> 52:42.540]  That dab alive roast. Death by
[52:42.540 --> 52:44.540]  lemons. Death by lemons. Okay.
[52:44.540 --> 52:46.540]  That's why when I hit it, it tastes like a damn mouth
[52:46.540 --> 52:48.540]  full of lemons. What you got over there, Maddie?
[52:48.540 --> 52:50.540]  Some death. Some New York City
[52:50.540 --> 52:52.540]  diesel. It's like life by lemons. There's no
[52:52.540 --> 52:54.540]  death to it.
[52:54.540 --> 52:56.540]  We should all exaggerate about how big this dab
[52:56.540 --> 52:58.540]  is. This is at least a gram, right? No, I'm not kidding.
[52:58.540 --> 53:00.540]  I'm just kidding, you guys. I can't do a gram dab
[53:00.540 --> 53:02.540]  and keep this show going. I'm already fucked up on edibles.
[53:02.540 --> 53:04.540]  I feel like Joey Diaz. I'm all fucked
[53:04.540 --> 53:06.540]  up on edibles, dog. I feel more
[53:06.540 --> 53:08.540]  like Lee Syatt at this point.
[53:08.540 --> 53:10.540]  I'm gonna take a dab. Somebody else say something.
[53:10.540 --> 53:12.540]  It's incredible how Joey corruptedly
[53:12.540 --> 53:14.540]  truly took this
[53:14.540 --> 53:16.540]  innocent boy and turned him
[53:16.540 --> 53:18.540]  into
[53:18.540 --> 53:20.540]  a real stoner
[53:20.540 --> 53:22.540]  and psychedelic adventurer.
[53:22.540 --> 53:24.540]  Yeah, that guy went from being
[53:24.540 --> 53:26.540]  afraid to smoke a joint to eating
[53:26.540 --> 53:28.540]  500 milligrams of edibles every podcast
[53:28.540 --> 53:30.540]  that he's on now. I'm impressed.
[53:30.540 --> 53:32.540]  He eats more
[53:32.540 --> 53:34.540]  edibles on every show
[53:34.540 --> 53:36.540]  than we've all eaten tonight combined.
[53:36.540 --> 53:38.540]  Maddie, how much edibles did you eat?
[53:38.540 --> 53:40.540]  At least 600 milligrams.
[53:40.540 --> 53:42.540]  No, not... I was gonna say
[53:42.540 --> 53:44.540]  600. I have to carry you
[53:44.540 --> 53:46.540]  to the car. Holy shit.
[53:46.540 --> 53:48.540]  Alright, I see a shuffle happening.
[53:48.540 --> 53:50.540]  Maddie
[53:50.540 --> 53:52.540]  just got up and bailed, you guys. She's like,
[53:52.540 --> 53:54.540]  fuck it, I'm out. Over this.
[53:54.540 --> 53:56.540]  I had enough of this taco stand.
[53:56.540 --> 53:58.540]  No, I just had a third set throw it away.
[53:58.540 --> 54:00.540]  I'm just picking on you. Thanks for
[54:00.540 --> 54:02.540]  coming back. Thanks for not leaving forever.
[54:02.540 --> 54:04.540]  Alright, that dab's
[54:04.540 --> 54:06.540]  working in my brain. Somebody better say something
[54:06.540 --> 54:08.540]  halfway intelligent.
[54:08.540 --> 54:10.540]  What y'all wanna talk about? This room just
[54:10.540 --> 54:12.540]  went silent. It's episode 100.
[54:12.540 --> 54:14.540]  Do you guys... How many times have you been
[54:14.540 --> 54:16.540]  on the show, Spence?
[54:16.540 --> 54:18.540]  Probably like six or seven times, maybe?
[54:18.540 --> 54:20.540]  Do you have a moment that stands out to you really well?
[54:20.540 --> 54:22.540]  No.
[54:22.540 --> 54:24.540]  I like all of them.
[54:24.540 --> 54:26.540]  The shows are fun. It's a fun show, right?
[54:26.540 --> 54:28.540]  Taking big ol' fatty dabs and hanging out.
[54:28.540 --> 54:30.540]  I really like when Jesse's here
[54:30.540 --> 54:32.540]  because Jesse gets so
[54:32.540 --> 54:34.540]  high when he's hanging out with all of us
[54:34.540 --> 54:36.540]  because he just keeps taking dabs with us.
[54:36.540 --> 54:38.540]  I think it's hilarious. He always
[54:38.540 --> 54:40.540]  tries to say, I didn't eat anything
[54:40.540 --> 54:42.540]  today. But we know he ate.
[54:42.540 --> 54:44.540]  He's a big ol' dude. You know he ate a bunch.
[54:44.540 --> 54:46.540]  He grows food. You know he ate something.
[54:46.540 --> 54:48.540]  Buzzy, you were on
[54:48.540 --> 54:50.540]  Buzzy, you were on one time. What was your favorite
[54:50.540 --> 54:52.540]  moment from the time you were on?
[54:52.540 --> 54:54.540]  That everybody really
[54:54.540 --> 54:56.540]  heard podcast number two.
[54:56.540 --> 54:58.540]  I would have never told anybody about that.
[54:58.540 --> 55:00.540]  Oh, this episode 100 is all good.
[55:00.540 --> 55:02.540]  I'm not embarrassed. Just totally
[55:02.540 --> 55:04.540]  messed up the first episode.
[55:04.540 --> 55:06.540]  Some people get stage fright a little bit when we hit record.
[55:06.540 --> 55:08.540]  Some people go blank as soon as you hit the record
[55:08.540 --> 55:10.540]  button. Talkative people go silent.
[55:10.540 --> 55:12.540]  And so we had Buzzy on one night
[55:12.540 --> 55:14.540]  and he was talking and he just went blank from a dab.
[55:14.540 --> 55:16.540]  So we had to piece together two episodes
[55:16.540 --> 55:18.540]  and we made a great episode.
[55:18.540 --> 55:20.540]  It wasn't bad at all. But I'm glad you enjoyed take two.
[55:20.540 --> 55:22.540]  Oh yeah. I'm not that big of a talker either.
[55:22.540 --> 55:24.540]  I hadn't dabbed
[55:24.540 --> 55:26.540]  in a while.
[55:26.540 --> 55:28.540]  Then I took one and I was just
[55:28.540 --> 55:30.540]  gone. Yeah, and it was a rise.
[55:30.540 --> 55:32.540]  Which is straight sativa. And it took a minute
[55:32.540 --> 55:34.540]  to recover. Yeah, it did.
[55:34.540 --> 55:36.540]  Gain some
[55:36.540 --> 55:38.540]  composure.
[55:38.540 --> 55:40.540]  Yeah, gain anything back.
[55:40.540 --> 55:42.540]  Anything. Yeah, your color.
[55:42.540 --> 55:44.540]  Sloppy sloppy. It's your second time
[55:44.540 --> 55:46.540]  on the show, right? Indeed.
[55:46.540 --> 55:48.540]  What's your favorite moment? It could be from any episode.
[55:48.540 --> 55:50.540]  Not just one that you were on, I guess. What's your favorite moment
[55:50.540 --> 55:52.540]  from the show so far?
[55:52.540 --> 55:54.540]  Probably this one. Just being all
[55:54.540 --> 55:56.540]  edible high? To be real. Are you Chinese?
[55:56.540 --> 55:58.540]  Are you part Chinese?
[55:58.540 --> 56:00.540]  Do you have any Asian in your blood?
[56:00.540 --> 56:02.540]  Because you look like you might be Asian today.
[56:02.540 --> 56:04.540]  Just grandma's edibles.
[56:04.540 --> 56:06.540]  Yeah, not this one.
[56:06.540 --> 56:08.540]  Everybody here just chilling out.
[56:08.540 --> 56:10.540]  I really enjoy this. This is nice.
[56:10.540 --> 56:12.540]  Hey Jesse, we wish you were here, bro.
[56:12.540 --> 56:14.540]  Oh, slack ass.
[56:16.540 --> 56:18.540]  He had important shit to handle, so no worries.
[56:18.540 --> 56:20.540]  I don't know what's going on.
[56:20.540 --> 56:22.540]  Thanks for coming and getting edible
[56:22.540 --> 56:24.540]  drunk with us. For sure. It's going to be a fun
[56:24.540 --> 56:26.540]  night. Mike, you've been on the show how many times, dude?
[56:26.540 --> 56:28.540]  I don't even know at this point.
[56:28.540 --> 56:30.540]  Over 99 times.
[56:30.540 --> 56:32.540]  Yeah, probably like 20, 25 times.
[56:32.540 --> 56:34.540]  Maybe closer to 50. I really don't
[56:34.540 --> 56:36.540]  know. How many other
[56:36.540 --> 56:38.540]  girls have been on the podcast?
[56:38.540 --> 56:40.540]  Angela?
[56:40.540 --> 56:42.540]  One time I did a live show
[56:42.540 --> 56:44.540]  at another location
[56:44.540 --> 56:46.540]  and there were two or three women on the show
[56:46.540 --> 56:48.540]  there, but they didn't come here where we
[56:48.540 --> 56:50.540]  normally record. I did a show
[56:50.540 --> 56:52.540]  from the... I remember
[56:52.540 --> 56:54.540]  we were trying to open up a smokers
[56:54.540 --> 56:56.540]  club kind of thing, like a public
[56:56.540 --> 56:58.540]  consumption place, and there was
[56:58.540 --> 57:00.540]  Misty and
[57:00.540 --> 57:02.540]  Terry, and
[57:02.540 --> 57:04.540]  I think there was another lady on the show.
[57:04.540 --> 57:06.540]  There have been like three or four, four or five
[57:06.540 --> 57:08.540]  ladies on the show, but you're the one that's been on
[57:08.540 --> 57:10.540]  the most. You should do an all-girls podcast.
[57:10.540 --> 57:12.540]  Can I be there too?
[57:12.540 --> 57:14.540]  What is this, Desperate Dab Wives?
[57:14.540 --> 57:16.540]  No, no, no, with you, but like just like have all the...
[57:16.540 --> 57:18.540]  So myself and you and who
[57:18.540 --> 57:20.540]  else? You gotta bring ladies. There's some girls
[57:20.540 --> 57:22.540]  from the Springs that grow. Damsel.
[57:22.540 --> 57:24.540]  Damsel. Hey,
[57:24.540 --> 57:26.540]  Damsel, you're invited to the show. She'll be on eventually. We're
[57:26.540 --> 57:28.540]  doing a project together, so she'll be here. Yeah, but
[57:28.540 --> 57:30.540]  I can think of a few girls that grow that would love to
[57:30.540 --> 57:32.540]  come on the podcast. Alright, so if you can get
[57:32.540 --> 57:34.540]  them on, we'll do the show. You let me know whenever
[57:34.540 --> 57:36.540]  two or three other grower girls
[57:36.540 --> 57:38.540]  grow girls.
[57:38.540 --> 57:40.540]  If you're in the Colorado Springs, Pueblo, or
[57:40.540 --> 57:42.540]  Denver area and you'd like to be on a podcast,
[57:42.540 --> 57:44.540]  it sounds like we're a game show all of
[57:44.540 --> 57:46.540]  a sudden. If you'd like to be on a show,
[57:46.540 --> 57:48.540]  let us know.
[57:48.540 --> 57:50.540]  Yeah, either Maddie or myself.
[57:50.540 --> 57:52.540]  We didn't give out Maddie's
[57:52.540 --> 57:54.540]  Twitter or Instagram stuff.
[57:54.540 --> 57:56.540]  How do you find us, Maddie? I am only on Instagram.
[57:56.540 --> 57:58.540]  How do we find you on Instagram, Maddie?
[57:58.540 --> 58:00.540]  I'm losing my voice. Is Maddie
[58:00.540 --> 58:02.540]  M-A-D-I-G-B
[58:02.540 --> 58:04.540]  underscore
[58:04.540 --> 58:06.540]  Maddie G-B
[58:06.540 --> 58:08.540]  growing
[58:08.540 --> 58:10.540]  growing
[58:10.540 --> 58:12.540]  and we all know how to find Spence. It's at
[58:12.540 --> 58:14.540]  Garden of Weeden.
[58:14.540 --> 58:16.540]  Follow Mike
[58:16.540 --> 58:18.540]  at Team Weeden
[58:18.540 --> 58:20.540]  17. Team Weeden 17.
[58:20.540 --> 58:22.540]  Is that your new one? Who is that?
[58:22.540 --> 58:24.540]  It's Mike. That's Mike. I thought Mike was...
[58:24.540 --> 58:26.540]  He converted.
[58:26.540 --> 58:28.540]  He came from Call Me Big Mike
[58:28.540 --> 58:30.540]  to a Garden of Weeden
[58:30.540 --> 58:32.540]  related... Yours is
[58:32.540 --> 58:34.540]  great, Maddie. You don't need to change yours. It's Maddie
[58:34.540 --> 58:36.540]  G-B Weeden.
[58:36.540 --> 58:38.540]  Maddie G-B Weeden.
[58:38.540 --> 58:40.540]  I thought that Big Mike was a
[58:40.540 --> 58:42.540]  perpetrator when he
[58:42.540 --> 58:44.540]  first changed it over. I was like,
[58:44.540 --> 58:46.540]  who's this person? And I started looking
[58:46.540 --> 58:48.540]  and I was like, this is weird.
[58:48.540 --> 58:50.540]  I was about to hit him up and be like, somebody stole your identity
[58:50.540 --> 58:52.540]  and made a new profile. It's called Team
[58:52.540 --> 58:54.540]  Weeden. What's wrong with
[58:54.540 --> 58:56.540]  these people?
[58:56.540 --> 58:58.540]  I need a seatbelt on this
[58:58.540 --> 59:00.540]  chair. I feel like I'm about to fly away.
[59:00.540 --> 59:02.540]  Maddie, you've got a big old grin and you're
[59:02.540 --> 59:04.540]  rocking back and forth like Ray Charles
[59:04.540 --> 59:06.540]  over there. You need a piano? You want to write me a melody?
[59:06.540 --> 59:08.540]  I need food.
[59:08.540 --> 59:10.540]  Spence needs some food.
[59:10.540 --> 59:12.540]  I need food.
[59:12.540 --> 59:14.540]  Let's take another dab and then let's
[59:14.540 --> 59:16.540]  start saying goodbye to all of our friends. We got
[59:16.540 --> 59:18.540]  a whole bunch of cool ass people at the table. You guys, I want
[59:18.540 --> 59:20.540]  to thank everybody for coming.
[59:20.540 --> 59:22.540]  Shout out to everybody for
[59:22.540 --> 59:24.540]  getting out of the house.
[59:24.540 --> 59:26.540]  You know me, I'm a homebody.
[59:26.540 --> 59:28.540]  I don't be out here,
[59:28.540 --> 59:30.540]  but I'm out here.
[59:30.540 --> 59:32.540]  Everybody's got a garden to tend to. Mike's got a baby to
[59:32.540 --> 59:34.540]  take care of. Yeah. So it took a little
[59:34.540 --> 59:36.540]  effort to get everybody here. So thanks guys for coming.
[59:36.540 --> 59:38.540]  Everybody showed up at 710 on a Thursday
[59:38.540 --> 59:40.540]  evening. Everybody was on time. That's fucking
[59:40.540 --> 59:42.540]  impressive. I appreciate you guys. This is a great
[59:42.540 --> 59:44.540]  team to have in your arsenal. You want a dab
[59:44.540 --> 59:46.540]  brother? It's a dab for Spence.
[59:46.540 --> 59:48.540]  He's already hungry. We're just giving him a dab
[59:48.540 --> 59:50.540]  to entice him to hang out for a minute.
[59:50.540 --> 59:52.540]  Yeah, we're like, you get a dab.
[59:52.540 --> 59:54.540]  You get a dab.
[59:54.540 --> 59:56.540]  Anybody over there need a dab? I will never
[59:56.540 --> 59:58.540]  say no to a dab.
[59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.540]  Unless it's like black.
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.540]  Unless it's black.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.540]  And that's not a...
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.540]  That has nothing to do...
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.540]  It's not a racial thing. You just don't want to smoke
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.540]  that black slab. I get it. Sometimes
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.540]  it's a little scary smoking some janky hash.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:14.540]  So what's the best way to handle that? That's a
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:16.540]  good thing we can talk about here for the last couple of minutes on
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.540]  the show while we take a dab and wrap up.
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.540]  This will be our little wrap up conversation. Just say no.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.540]  What's a good way to handle that? Right now,
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.540]  if somebody was like, Matty, you alright bro? You tripping?
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:26.540]  I just...
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.540]  This happens all the time when people offer
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.540]  you stuff and you just like, you don't want
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.540]  to take it at all and you have to politely think
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.540]  of a way to do that. So yeah, what's the way to do that? What's the best
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.540]  way to handle that, you guys? What is the most...
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.540]  You literally
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.540]  have to just
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.540]  educate them for it.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.540]  Just be like, my new
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.540]  thing is, I only smoke
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:48.540]  stuff that I know personally
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.540]  where it's grown and
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.540]  processed at. If I don't do that,
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.540]  if I don't know that, then I'm not going to smoke it.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.540]  It's nothing personal.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.540]  Nothing personal. Just strictly for my health.
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.540]  I think it's rude to see
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.540]  somebody smoking something bad for them
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.540]  and not inform them. They may get
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.540]  like, you know...
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.540]  Even if they get defensive about it,
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.540]  don't try to be confrontational with
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.540]  it, but at least you can feel good at the end of the day
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.540]  like, hey, I told that dude he's smoking
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.540]  something that's going to kill him. Yeah. Because
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.540]  if I saw somebody drop
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.540]  some rat poison in some lasagna
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.540]  and then put it at the table, I'd
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.540]  definitely look at y'all and be like, hey,
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:26.540]  we shouldn't eat this damn lasagna.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:30.540]  So I just think it's
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:32.540]  wrong not to be like... I would just look
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.540]  at them and be like, hey,
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.540]  I don't want to
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.540]  offend you in any way, but I don't feel comfortable
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.540]  smoking that and this is why.
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.540]  Because da da da da da da da.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:44.540]  Kind of looks like boo boo, my friend.
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.540]  I've seen Spencer just get up and walk away.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.540]  Right before his dab is up.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.540]  Spencer will look at you like...
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.540]  I've left my big places
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.540]  and I'm like, oh, he's getting a dab.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.540]  They want to give me this shit and I'm like,
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.540]  here, try this. And that's what I
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.540]  that would have been my solution is
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.540]  if somebody pulls out boo boo, I'm like, oh, why don't you take a dab
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.540]  of this and just give that to them and then yeah.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.540]  Saying or nah in kind of
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.540]  a high-pitched voice is always acceptable as well.
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.540]  Like, you want some of that or nah?
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.540]  You guys want some of my boo boo hash?
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.540]  You guys, get some good hash.
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.540]  Don't settle for some crap.
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.540]  I know some of you guys just want to get high, cop a buzz.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.540]  Don't settle for some boo boo.
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:22.540]  Smoke some good hash. Get some Gardner Wheaton extracts.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.540]  It should never crackle.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.540]  That's the truth. It should never crackle.
[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:28.540]  Sometimes in the summer it'll crackle because your fucking crusty ass fingers
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.540]  put moisture in it, but it should never crackle.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:32.540]  It should never crackle unless if you
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.540]  fucking touch it and play with it.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.540]  Like, sometimes I do when I'm really high.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.540]  Put your fingers all up in it.
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.540]  But, other than that...
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.540]  Skrrt!
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.540]  Free Gucci.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.540]  Skrrt!
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:48.540]  Do I even... I was going to ask a question,
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.540]  but I don't even want to know the answer to my question.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.540]  I don't even remember.
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.540]  Man, you remember your number, Tony.
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.540]  I can't remember the other dude's name, so I already forgot.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.540]  I said it to myself one time and then it went away.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.540]  Who's Drake beefing with?
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.540]  Meek.
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.540]  Meek? So, you on Team Drake or Team Meek?
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:08.540]  I fuck with Drake.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.540]  Honestly.
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.540]  Meek fucked it up.
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.540]  I thought you guys were on Team Waka Flocka.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.540]  I fuck with Flocka the long way.
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.540]  But you asked who was Drake or Meek.
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.540]  Yeah, alright.
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.540]  I just knew you'd know the answer because I definitely didn't know the answer.
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.540]  I want to see them box.
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.540]  You want to see them box?
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.540]  Do you think they should do it on pay-per-view?
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.540]  Nah, because they fans should do it in the back alley.
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:36.540]  Do it in the back alley?
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.540]  Do it on fucking... the World Star or some shit?
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:40.540]  World Star.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.540]  World Star, so I'm calling them out.
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.540]  World Star is a massive download.
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.540]  How much money you got on the side? What are you throwing down?
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.540]  The fight?
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:50.540]  Meek is what Drake's answer is.
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.540]  You seen Drake lately though?
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.540]  Nah, he's swole.
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.540]  He been lifting.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.540]  Is it Serena?
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.540]  Yeah, Serena.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.540]  She like a minotaur.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.540]  You gotta prepare for that.
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.540]  No way.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.540]  She's crushing him with them thighs.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.540]  He's working on his lift.
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.540]  Hey, you remember
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:14.540]  Don't Be a Menace in the Hood while drinking?
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:16.540]  Of course we do.
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.540]  You're not my friend if you don't know that.
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.540]  You know the part where
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.540]  the big Hulk girl is like
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:24.540]  That's Drake in there.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.540]  Oh, them edibles.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.540]  Look what I just started.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.540]  I like it. I'm proud of myself for that question.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.540]  God damn, that worked out really well.
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.540]  So we're looking for sponsors.
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:36.540]  We want to get that shit going on pay-per-view, you guys.
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.540]  If you want to throw it down.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.540]  Yeah, I'll host that shit, honestly.
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:42.540]  For sure.
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.540]  If we got somewhere to fight, I'll be the host.
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.540]  We'll do it at the State Fair Convention Center.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.540]  You guys.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.540]  Drake vs. Meek.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:52.540]  That'd be the most black people that have ever been in that building at one time, I bet.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:54.540]  In Pueblo at one time.
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.540]  Oh, I saw a stat.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.540]  Mike's trying hard not to laugh at that. Come on, it's funny, bro.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.540]  You can laugh.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.540]  I saw the stats the other day about
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.540]  how many people moved to Colorado
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.540]  in the past year.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.540]  Or from 2013 to 2014,
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.540]  it was 200,000 people.
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.540]  That's how many people came here?
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:16.540]  Came from different states to Colorado.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.540]  I'm one of those immigrants. Yeah, welcome home.
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.540]  And they said,
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.540]  I want to say 5,000 people
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:24.540]  come to Denver
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.540]  that disperse
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.540]  through the state almost every month.
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.540]  Wow, okay.
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:32.540]  So yeah, I know a couple of people. Shout out George and Amanda.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:34.540]  That's how Adam got here.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.540]  I got a couple people.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:38.540]  Shout out to
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.540]  Team Whedon for bringing me.
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.540]  They brought half of North Carolina.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:44.540]  There's a town in North Carolina that's just a fucking ghost town now.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.540]  Everybody's here.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.540]  It's so funny now because people that live in North Carolina
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.540]  that are like,
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.540]  I might move to Colorado.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:56.540]  It's like, where are you moving to?
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.540]  I'm thinking about moving to Puebs, dog.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.540]  It's full, bro.
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.540]  Just tell them, go drive around Durham for a little bit.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.540]  But it's going to get more money to businesses here.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.540]  That's true, yeah.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.540]  And I truly believe that.
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.540]  I think that's something that Pueblo needs.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.540]  In 10 years, Pueblo will be as big as the Springs.
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:16.540]  Oh yeah, they'll touch pretty soon.
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.540]  Yeah, pretty soon they'll be like,
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:20.540]  it ain't going to be I-5 anymore.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.540]  Do you think people can still move here from other states
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.540]  and set up a grove and start banging like they used to?
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.540]  Or is the regulation and is the market kind of shut?
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.540]  I think that
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.540]  is on the down.
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:32.540]  It's coming down, but I still think there's people that are moving here
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.540]  getting badges, getting jobs in the industry
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.540]  and that's all they need.
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.540]  Yeah, that's the truth.
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:40.540]  Get up on the mic just a little bit.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.540]  There you go.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.540]  People just want to start a new life and it's amazing to do that
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:46.540]  in a state that has recreational marijuana.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.540]  There's no fear for them.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.540]  People love to move here from North Carolina.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.540]  They're moving here from everywhere.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.540]  If you're coming to Colorado, if you're coming here,
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.540]  if you're showing up here, come get a badge.
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.540]  Get an MED badge.
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.540]  Don't try to do your...
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.540]  Grow your own in your basement.
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.540]  Don't try to do a big fat commercial grow.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.540]  Don't try to bust some shit out because you're going to get yourself in trouble.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.540]  They're really cracking down on you here in Colorado.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.540]  Either you're going to get yourself in trouble or you're going to fail
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.540]  and lose money because you think you can do it
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.540]  and the next thing you know,
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:16.540]  come harvest time and you're pulling
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.540]  an ounce of plant and you're supposed to be pulling
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.540]  10 ounces.
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.540]  So there's things that...
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.540]  If you do your research, you can definitely grow
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.540]  your own weed. There's nothing wrong with
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.540]  everybody growing their own weed in their house
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.540]  or in a tent or something like that.
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.540]  But when it comes to thinking you can come...
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:34.540]  I came two years ago
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.540]  and I was late.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.540]  There's people in the mountains
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.540]  that have 60k
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.540]  garages and that's what they do.
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:44.540]  And everybody here has got a weed guy.
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.540]  So if you think you're going to move here and have somebody
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.540]  to sell your weed to...
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.540]  I bet you that person has 10 other people
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.540]  that they go and get weed from.
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:56.190]  How does the drought
[01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:58.190]  happen with all of this?
[01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:00.190]  Oddly enough, there is a drought here in Colorado
[01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:02.190]  right now for some reason. It's almost harvest time.
[01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:04.190]  People are chopping shit down right now. It's dropping.
[01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:06.190]  It's about time to go.
[01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:08.190]  The drought is upon us.
[01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:10.190]  Happy Croptober everybody. I hope you guys are sitting around right now
[01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:12.190]  trimming. I hope you're getting
[01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:14.190]  plenty of medicine in you while you're trimming.
[01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:16.190]  I hope you're smoking some scissor hash. That's Mike's
[01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:18.190]  favorite part. Make some
[01:08:18.190 --> 01:08:20.190]  fucking rosin out of that scissor hash. Press that
[01:08:20.190 --> 01:08:22.190]  shit. See what happens.
[01:08:22.190 --> 01:08:24.190]  Do you ever use trim bins dog?
[01:08:24.190 --> 01:08:26.190]  Trim bins are off
[01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:28.190]  the fucking chain. You get a lot of resin in there?
[01:08:28.190 --> 01:08:30.190]  A lot of cure for that? Bro, like
[01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:32.190]  so much. Shout out to
[01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:34.190]  trim bins. And if you make raw, like I
[01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:36.190]  have like, I probably got
[01:08:36.190 --> 01:08:38.190]  like right around an ounce
[01:08:38.190 --> 01:08:40.190]  of pretty good. It would melt but it's
[01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:42.190]  a little contaminated so you would raws
[01:08:42.190 --> 01:08:44.190]  and take it. I just ain't got around to doing
[01:08:44.190 --> 01:08:46.190]  it yet but it's still like
[01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:48.190]  extra. You know,
[01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:50.190]  you pay 50 bucks but I got a zip of
[01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:52.190]  you know, trim bin key.
[01:08:52.190 --> 01:08:54.190]  That 50 bucks has been
[01:08:54.190 --> 01:08:56.190]  paid for. Yeah. So,
[01:08:56.190 --> 01:08:58.190]  and it's neat.
[01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:00.190]  Hers is too small. It's not big enough to juice.
[01:09:00.190 --> 01:09:02.190]  That's on purpose.
[01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:06.190]  It's okay. It's alright. We can go to
[01:09:06.190 --> 01:09:08.190]  Bed Bath & Beyond. We'll get this taken care of. It's always weird
[01:09:08.190 --> 01:09:10.190]  when you come home and you see your hair straightener like
[01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:12.190]  in the kitchen and you're like, uh,
[01:09:12.190 --> 01:09:14.190]  what happened in here? We was making
[01:09:14.190 --> 01:09:16.190]  rosin, girl. I feel weird buying
[01:09:16.190 --> 01:09:18.190]  a hair straightener.
[01:09:18.190 --> 01:09:20.190]  I got dreadlocks. I didn't even try to go get one.
[01:09:20.190 --> 01:09:22.190]  Maybe it wasn't
[01:09:22.190 --> 01:09:24.190]  for me. Somebody make a meme out of that if
[01:09:24.190 --> 01:09:26.190]  you haven't already. Is this a birthday present,
[01:09:26.190 --> 01:09:28.190]  sir? Do you need this gift wrapped? I'm making
[01:09:28.190 --> 01:09:30.190]  drugs, man. I love it when
[01:09:30.190 --> 01:09:32.190]  you go to Bed Bath & Beyond. That's the right
[01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:34.190]  store, right? Yeah. They got the dab torch
[01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:36.190]  right there. They got the baking mat right there.
[01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:38.190]  The sleek pads. Yeah.
[01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:40.190]  They got everything. They know exactly. Parchment
[01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:42.190]  paper. It's all in the same area. They know exactly
[01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:44.190]  what's going on. Or they've done, they've got a computer
[01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:46.190]  that tells them what's happening.
[01:09:46.190 --> 01:09:48.190]  We've sold one million torches this year.
[01:09:48.190 --> 01:09:50.190]  People that bought
[01:09:50.190 --> 01:09:52.190]  the torch also bought this baking mat.
[01:09:52.190 --> 01:09:54.190]  People that bought this baking mat also
[01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:56.190]  bought this. Yeah, that's how they do it in a computer.
[01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:58.190]  They put them next to each other. Spence, you look
[01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:00.190]  exhausted, bro. Damn, that was inspiring.
[01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:02.190]  He just stretched and grew an inch.
[01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:06.190]  He's still sleeping. You still up, bro?
[01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:08.190]  You just took a brief nap.
[01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:10.190]  Mm-hmm.
[01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:12.190]  All right. I mean, it's time to go,
[01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:14.190]  you guys. This was episode number 100. I want to thank you guys
[01:10:14.190 --> 01:10:16.190]  for joining us. Holy shit, this was a lot of fun.
[01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:18.190]  Thanks to Spence for coming. Thanks to Maddie for coming.
[01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:20.190]  Thanks to Mike for coming. Thanks to Slap for showing up.
[01:10:20.190 --> 01:10:22.190]  Thanks to Joe for showing up. Thanks for coming, you guys.
[01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:24.190]  Thanks for getting dabbed the fuck out. Thank you for having a podcast
[01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:26.190]  that we hit 100 episodes on. Yeah.
[01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:28.190]  Good job, bro. This was fun. Thanks a lot, man.
[01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:30.190]  This was a lot of fun. I hope everybody made it through this.
[01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:32.190]  I'm like slouched over in my chair.
[01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:34.190]  I hope everyone listening to this got
[01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:36.190]  as high as we did. I hope you guys are wrecked
[01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:38.190]  right now. I hope somebody's melting into a chair. You guys, I ate
[01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:40.190]  120 milligrams. It's been,
[01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:42.190]  we've been recording for an hour and 11 minutes.
[01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:44.190]  That means about an hour ago I probably ate that shit-ish.
[01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:46.190]  I think I'm going to live. You're going to have a good
[01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:48.190]  rest of the night. Yeah.
[01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:50.190]  There's definitely food and cartoons
[01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:52.190]  in my future. At Chipotle.
[01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:54.190]  Yeah.
[01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:56.190]  There might be a long ass line at Chipotle
[01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:58.190]  in a minute. All of us.
[01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:00.190]  Stoned ass bastards at Chipotle here
[01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:02.190]  in just a couple of minutes. So shout out to Chipotle.
[01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:04.190]  Shout out to everybody's bathroom later.
[01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:08.190]  Let's see. How much of this
[01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:10.190]  do I want to do? I want to thank you guys for listening. Dude,
[01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:12.190]  I'll be back. Apparently there's some news
[01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:14.190]  that we got to talk about. So I'll be back with episode number
[01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.190]  101. It'll be a news episode.
[01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:18.190]  I'm not going to read all this extra stuff.
[01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:20.190]  Google leave us a five star rating on iTunes.
[01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:22.190]  Go to the iTunes store. Search for

[01:12:00.190 --> 01:12:02.190]  100 hugs for me.
[01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:25.500]  Woo!
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.500]  Not sure.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.140]  Everything
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:03.140]  we play
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:05.140]  has strictly roots.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:07.140]  Everything we play
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.140]  has strictly roots.
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:11.140]  Strictly roots.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:13.140]  This is our roots up there.
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.140]  So everyone says strictly roots.
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.140]  Strictly roots.
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.140]  The bigger heads, we feel it.
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.140]  More roots, the people
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.140]  are hearing.
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.140]  Take a hit off of this and take a spiritual
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.140]  if you're nothing else could make you feel
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:29.140]  this. Feel it in your soul.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:31.140]  Feel it in your heart. This
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.140]  your roots music, it make them
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:35.140]  attack. So whether near or
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:37.140]  far, earth, moon or star
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.140]  over everything else.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:41.140]  I and I say strictly roots.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.140]  Everything we play has strictly
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.140]  roots. When we say
