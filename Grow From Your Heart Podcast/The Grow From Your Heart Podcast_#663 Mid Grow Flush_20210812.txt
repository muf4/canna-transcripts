[00:00.000 --> 00:13.800]  Welcome back, Podcast World. I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is
[00:13.800 --> 00:21.000]  episode 663 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast. Before I get too far, if you're not old enough
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.200]  to watch this video, or if cultivating or consuming cannabis is illegal in your location,
[00:26.200 --> 00:31.240]  do it. And if you do it, you cannot blame me if you get caught. All right, in this episode,
[00:31.240 --> 00:35.680]  we're going to focus on flushing our plants. Before I get to that part of the show, let's
[00:35.680 --> 00:40.960]  do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks who support the show on Patreon. Let's start
[00:40.960 --> 00:46.720]  off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast. Thank you. Shout out to my friend StashDrop269.

[01:08.260 --> 01:13.340]  From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to my buddy Magic Mike. Big thanks and big
[01:13.340 --> 01:18.320]  shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon. If you are not already
[01:18.320 --> 01:21.760]  supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so, all you have to do is
[01:21.760 --> 01:28.600]  visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. All of the information you
[01:28.600 --> 01:32.640]  need is right there on the screen and you know I did include that link in the show notes
[01:32.640 --> 01:38.720]  and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends. You may have
[01:38.720 --> 01:43.800]  noticed that recently my Instagram account was deactivated. I did get that account back
[01:43.800 --> 01:48.280]  it is back if you're not already following me on Instagram. It's Iree underscore genetics
[01:48.280 --> 01:52.880]  on Instagram. Don't forget about the Monday night live show. That's right on Instagram
[01:52.880 --> 01:58.400]  every Monday, approximately 710pm Mountain Time I do go live on Instagram. I fire up
[01:58.400 --> 02:03.400]  the live feed we take a couple of dabs we listen to some music and I answer cultivation
[02:03.400 --> 02:08.320]  and cannabis culture questions live on the fly. Throw up your grow questions, throw up
[02:08.320 --> 02:12.080]  your grow ideas. I will answer your questions, make some comments and let you know what I
[02:12.080 --> 02:19.680]  think. So join me Monday approximately 710pm Mountain Time on the Instagram live feed.
[02:19.680 --> 02:23.840]  You may not get a notification. We may be shadow banded this time on Instagram. So you'll
[02:23.840 --> 02:29.360]  have to give me a follow then around 710pm Mountain Time open up the Instagram app. Look
[02:29.360 --> 02:34.920]  up at the top you'll see my little icon and my name with the red circle around it. If
[02:34.920 --> 02:38.880]  it's got a red or a green circle around it, that means I may be live click on that check
[02:38.880 --> 02:43.120]  out the live feed. Hang out with us. Leave some comments. I'll answer your comments there
[02:43.120 --> 02:50.640]  in the live feed. I am going to rely less on Instagram and other social media platforms.
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.440]  They are attacking and banning cannabis related content. So I don't want to support them if
[02:55.440 --> 03:00.200]  they're not going to support us. What I am going to do is focus my energy more on the
[03:00.200 --> 03:06.600]  discord server and more on the cannabis application. Cannabis definitely supports cannabis friendly
[03:06.600 --> 03:10.960]  content. They're all about cannabis content. Join me on cannabis. It's a free app you can
[03:10.960 --> 03:15.160]  download for your phone. Download it just like any other app. Create an account just
[03:15.160 --> 03:20.480]  like all the other apps. Log in, post your cannabis friendly photos, your dab videos,
[03:20.480 --> 03:25.280]  your bong rip videos, your duck face smoking videos. All your cool cannabis photography
[03:25.280 --> 03:31.560]  is invited and promoted and encouraged on the cannabis application. So join us there.
[03:31.560 --> 03:35.980]  The other place you will find me more frequently is on my discord server. That's right. There's
[03:35.980 --> 03:41.180]  an Iree Genetics, Iree Army, Grow From Your Heart podcast discord server. There are a
[03:41.180 --> 03:44.820]  lot of great people hanging out there right now. Big shout out to all of them. They have
[03:44.820 --> 03:49.900]  built me a wonderful community over there on discord. I will be on the discord more.
[03:49.900 --> 03:54.140]  We've reached over a thousand members. I recently gave away a few prize packages. I'll be giving
[03:54.140 --> 03:58.260]  away more prize packages. I'll be hanging out in the live chat, the video chat, the
[03:58.260 --> 04:04.420]  voice chat more often. So join us over on the discord channel, the discord server. And
[04:04.420 --> 04:08.500]  big thanks to everybody who has signed up. There are over a thousand members on discord
[04:08.500 --> 04:14.860]  now. That is awesome. We recently added a page, a discord page for every Iree Genetics
[04:14.860 --> 04:19.460]  strain. Now you can go and post pictures of strain specific strains under those tabs.
[04:19.460 --> 04:23.480]  If you're curious about growing a strain or have questions, you can go there and interact
[04:23.480 --> 04:27.340]  with all of the people on the discord and see their experiences, their photos. You can
[04:27.340 --> 04:32.900]  ask them questions, have strain specific conversations on the discord channel. We are constantly
[04:32.940 --> 04:37.620]  working on improving it. Big shout out to the gang over there. Join us. There will be
[04:37.620 --> 04:45.200]  a link in the description. You may have noticed I did take a little bit of a social media
[04:45.200 --> 04:49.560]  break. I was a little bit overwhelmed with a lot of stuff. There was a lot of email happening.
[04:49.560 --> 04:54.080]  There was a lot of social media interaction. I'm on six or seven different apps. I produce
[04:54.080 --> 04:58.720]  a couple of different podcast episodes every week. I do a live show. I try to hang out
[04:58.720 --> 05:03.320]  with friends and family and have a real life outside of all this Iree Genetics stuff. I
[05:03.320 --> 05:08.680]  did take a little bit of a break from social media. I had to just for not just for mental
[05:08.680 --> 05:12.240]  health reasons, but for real life reasons. There was other shit that had to be done.
[05:12.240 --> 05:15.560]  Right now it is outdoor grow season. There may be some things happening outside. There
[05:15.560 --> 05:19.680]  may be some other things happening since it's summertime. We're allowed to go outside and
[05:19.680 --> 05:24.440]  go to events again. I'm going to do as much of that as I can, but I am trying to get back
[05:24.440 --> 05:28.360]  into the social media a little bit more. If you've been waiting for a message reply, if
[05:28.360 --> 05:32.160]  you've been waiting to see me post or something, it will be happening more frequently. It may
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.840]  not be on Instagram. It may not be on Facebook, but you will see me more active on social
[05:36.840 --> 05:41.760]  media again. Sometimes you got to step back. That's not even real. It's just everybody's
[05:41.760 --> 05:46.120]  just creating a bubble on there that doesn't even really exist. Don't let it overwhelm
[05:46.120 --> 05:49.920]  you. Don't let it get to you. Don't make it become part of a job. It is supposed to be
[05:49.920 --> 05:55.440]  fun, supposed to enjoy that. I wasn't enjoying it. It was too much work. It was overwhelming.
[05:55.440 --> 05:59.160]  When it got that overwhelming, I just gave up and signed out. When my account got deleted,
[05:59.160 --> 06:03.560]  it was almost relieving, but I missed all my friends and my DMs. I had to go find all
[06:03.560 --> 06:09.040]  my friends again. Glad I found you guys. All right. I am chattery. I am rambly. Take good
[06:09.040 --> 06:12.920]  care of yourself when you're working with social media. Don't let it get to your head.
[06:12.920 --> 06:16.800]  That shit's not real. Most of it is not even real. 90% of the time, those people wouldn't
[06:16.800 --> 06:21.240]  say half of what they're saying if they were in a room with people, but we just get weird
[06:21.240 --> 06:25.040]  with phones and computers in front of us. All right. I am rambling. Let's get to another
[06:25.040 --> 06:28.680]  very important topic. I've got something very important I want to address. Somebody drew
[06:28.680 --> 06:33.000]  this for me. Right here, there's going to be a logo popping up. They drew it. They designed
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.560]  this for me and they sent it to me. It is beautiful. I really like this logo. I've been
[06:37.560 --> 06:44.520]  using it in a few places. I owe you a prize, a gift, a thank you, and I can't find you.
[06:44.520 --> 06:49.680]  Most of the time, I save the artist's name in the file name. When I save the file, this
[06:49.680 --> 06:53.400]  file's been moved from computer to computer, from drive to drive. I failed at saving the
[06:53.400 --> 06:58.380]  file name with the person's name in it. I need your help. If you know who made this,
[06:58.380 --> 07:04.620]  if you made this, please send me your email address, your mailing address, maybe your
[07:04.620 --> 07:10.060]  shirt size, and I am going to pay you back for making this artwork right here. I need
[07:10.060 --> 07:12.700]  to quit doing that because every time I do it, I have to put the image back in and that's
[07:12.700 --> 07:15.740]  more editing. All right. Thank you for the great artwork.
[07:15.740 --> 07:19.900]  You folks that did submit art, like I said, I took a break. I got overwhelmed. I'm going
[07:19.900 --> 07:23.700]  back through all the emails. I'm going back through the file folders. When I'm using your
[07:23.700 --> 07:28.300]  art, you will get gifts for your submissions. I'm making sure to catch up, get everybody
[07:28.300 --> 07:32.380]  caught up. Make sure that you know that I do appreciate your work. Even if I didn't
[07:32.380 --> 07:35.780]  use your art, if I find it in a folder, I'm going to try to send you something because
[07:35.780 --> 07:40.940]  you did put work in. Thank you. Don't be shy to send more music and artwork to the show.
[07:40.940 --> 07:44.940]  I do like it. You may notice I'm using different artwork, making different intros, stuff like
[07:44.940 --> 07:47.480]  that. Let's focus on cannabis. I did say I was going
[07:47.480 --> 07:51.860]  to talk about flushing our plants. I had a friend say that he thought he messed up his
[07:51.860 --> 07:57.700]  crop because he did not flush between the veg phase and the flowering phase. I was like,
[07:57.700 --> 08:02.020]  there's no need to flush then. He's like, oh, my friends tell me that I have to flush.
[08:02.020 --> 08:06.360]  I think he means the internet. The internet says that he has to flush between the veg
[08:06.360 --> 08:10.180]  phase and the flower phase. I said, if you didn't do anything wrong, brother, there's
[08:10.180 --> 08:14.180]  no reason to flush during that phase. Then he said that he was taught that he should
[08:14.180 --> 08:20.440]  flush often to fix problems. I think that from what I have noticed, in most cases, unless
[08:20.480 --> 08:26.760]  you've got a major, major, major problem, flushing usually just causes more problems.
[08:26.760 --> 08:31.120]  We're going to talk a little bit about flushing at the end of the growth cycle, flushing pre-harvest
[08:31.120 --> 08:37.120]  a little bit. Let's talk a little bit about a mid-grow flush and a flush to solve problems.
[08:37.120 --> 08:42.200]  I don't think it's necessary. I think if you've got a problem ... What am I talking about?
[08:42.200 --> 08:45.840]  Let me recap what I'm even talking about. If you see a problem in your plants, people
[08:45.840 --> 08:49.760]  will say that they've got a problem. We'll say maybe a nutrient lockout or a nutrient
[08:49.800 --> 08:54.480]  burn or under some sort of problem that they can't completely identify. A lot of people,
[08:54.480 --> 08:58.720]  their first move is to flush. They will get a container of water. They will put the pH
[08:58.720 --> 09:03.120]  at whatever pH they're used to using, and they will just overwater the plant in an attempt
[09:03.120 --> 09:10.120]  to wash everything out of the root zone and start fresh. That's a good idea, but wouldn't
[09:10.640 --> 09:15.760]  it be a better idea, in my opinion, instead of rinsing out that root zone? Let's think
[09:15.760 --> 09:19.920]  about it. The plant's got a problem. Then you're going to just overwater it to where
[09:19.920 --> 09:23.960]  now it's overwatered. Now you've got two problems. Now your third problem that you're going to
[09:23.960 --> 09:30.000]  create is that it doesn't have any nutrients in its root zone. Now it's got problem number
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.220]  one that we haven't identified and we just panic flushed. Number two, now it's overwatered.
[09:35.220 --> 09:39.260]  Problem number three, now there's no nutrients in there. Now whatever it was overdone or
[09:39.260 --> 09:43.880]  deficient on, now it's definitely fucked because we just completely rinsed out everything.
[09:43.880 --> 09:48.280]  There's nothing in there. It's hungry. It's freaking out. People always say, it had this
[09:48.280 --> 09:53.720]  problem. I flushed and now they're doing this. I rarely hear people say, I had this problem.
[09:53.720 --> 09:58.600]  I flushed and I fixed it. I don't hear that. I get more calls of saying, dude, I flushed
[09:58.600 --> 10:02.080]  them. They look like shit now. Now what do I do? I say, just let them dry out and feed
[10:02.080 --> 10:07.440]  them properly and then they'll be back on track. I think if you're going to do a panic
[10:07.440 --> 10:14.520]  flush, why not mix up a solid feed? I call it like a triage feed or just a solid diet
[10:14.520 --> 10:19.220]  or a good meal plan. Like if you went to the, if you went to the doctor and you're like
[10:19.220 --> 10:22.120]  sick and you got some problems, the first thing they're going to do is stick an IV in
[10:22.120 --> 10:25.600]  you and get you some vitamins and get you hydrated. Let's do that for the plant. Let's
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.080]  mix up a good batch of nutrients. What is your basic feed? What are you normally feeding
[10:30.080 --> 10:34.000]  this plant? Do you have nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium? Do you have your calcium, magnesium?
[10:34.520 --> 10:38.160]  Do you have your basic nutrients that these plants need? Do you have some fulvic acid
[10:38.160 --> 10:43.840]  in there to help them uptake? Do you have some carbs in there? Do you have some microbes
[10:43.840 --> 10:48.160]  in there? Do you have things in there to put this plant in its top performance? Whatever
[10:48.160 --> 10:53.920]  phase you're in, if you're in veg, if you're in flour, mix up a really nice mix, some base
[10:53.920 --> 10:58.920]  nutrients, some CalMag, some microbes. I mentioned a bunch of things. Get a good solid mix in
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.560]  there, get the pH adjusted perfectly and then water that to runoff.
[11:03.680 --> 11:06.840]  What you're going to do, you're going to rinse out all the old shit that's in there. It's
[11:06.840 --> 11:10.160]  going to fall right out of the bottom as the plants get runoff and you're going to put
[11:10.160 --> 11:15.200]  a brand new meal in there. It's like delivering fucking soup and a sandwich to a sick friend.
[11:15.200 --> 11:18.760]  They've been eating fucking energy bars and drinking Gatorades all day because they've
[11:18.760 --> 11:22.080]  just been sick and struggling and that's what your plant's been doing. It's like, I'm fucked,
[11:22.080 --> 11:25.640]  I don't know what to do and you just gave it soup and a sandwich and a hug and that's
[11:25.640 --> 11:31.880]  really probably the best you could do for it in my opinion. I think a mid-grow or a
[11:31.920 --> 11:38.920]  mid-cycle flush is probably more detrimental than it is helpful to our plants in most cases.
[11:39.880 --> 11:45.000]  Now if you do have a major, major, major lockout or something, maybe you might want to flush
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.400]  and then at that point just do plain water or maybe do something. There are plenty of
[11:49.400 --> 11:54.000]  flushing products in there. Those are useful. The sugars in there do help unbind the salts
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.600]  into what's happening in there. That may work but unless you've got major, major issues,
[12:00.600 --> 12:07.000]  I don't think that flushing during the growth cycle is a good idea, a necessary idea. I
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.400]  think it's going to cause you more problems. You're going to overwater, you're going to
[12:10.400 --> 12:15.240]  make the plants thirsty and they already had one problem to start with so you're just compounding
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.400]  problems. Why not mix up something that we know is good for the plants? Like when people
[12:19.400 --> 12:22.840]  are sick, you don't just give them a bunch of water and hope that they just pee everything
[12:22.840 --> 12:26.160]  out. You've got to give them nutrients in a meal also. Like I said, bring them soup
[12:26.160 --> 12:31.000]  in a sandwich, maybe a multivitamin, maybe a kombucha to get some probiotics in them.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.960]  You've got to take care of them. The plants are the same way. We've got to take care of
[12:33.960 --> 12:39.840]  the plants. So I keep repeating myself that mid-cycle flush might be kind of silly. Most
[12:39.840 --> 12:46.600]  of what I've been talking about so far applies to a soilless mix type of a grow. Maybe you're
[12:46.600 --> 12:50.920]  using Fox Farms or some soil like that. That's what this would apply to. Something with bottled
[12:51.920 --> 12:57.160]  type of environment. Let's talk a little bit about hydro and flushing now. I don't think
[12:57.160 --> 13:03.520]  it's necessary to flush your grow mid-grow, your plants mid-grow with a hydroponic system.
[13:03.520 --> 13:08.160]  I think that is a missed opportunity for a feed. If you've got a big problem, if you
[13:08.160 --> 13:13.000]  see something is completely off. In any case, the first case, the first step, the first
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.320]  thing to do is identify the deficiency or the overfeed or the toxicity or whatever the
[13:18.320 --> 13:23.120]  problem is. Your first step is to identify that. Then, like I said before, mix up that
[13:23.120 --> 13:26.840]  proper feed. If you know what's off, correct that. If you know what you're giving too much
[13:26.840 --> 13:30.740]  of, don't feed it that this time. If you've given it too little of something, add some
[13:30.740 --> 13:34.860]  of that this time. But adjust your nutrients and then get that in the reservoir and get
[13:34.860 --> 13:39.240]  it fed to the plants. I don't like to run a lot of plain water through a hydro system
[13:39.240 --> 13:43.540]  and not feed the plants. The reason we're doing hydroponics is to get as many feeds
[13:43.540 --> 13:47.940]  as possible to kind of beef up those plants and get as many nutrients into it. So we're
[13:48.060 --> 13:52.040]  missing an opportunity to feed them. We should just mix up the feed that they need and get
[13:52.040 --> 13:58.120]  it to them every time instead of doing just plain water. So the first step in any case
[13:58.120 --> 14:04.140]  to solving a nutrient issue, whether it's over or under feed, is to identify the problem.
[14:04.140 --> 14:08.420]  What nutrient are we missing? And a lot of times it is two nutrients working together
[14:08.420 --> 14:12.940]  or against each other. You'll notice if you overfeed one thing, you'll see a problem with
[14:12.940 --> 14:16.620]  another. If you underfeed one thing, you'll see a problem with a different nutrient. They
[14:16.620 --> 14:21.660]  work in balance together. So pay close attention. Keep good notes of everything that you fed.
[14:21.660 --> 14:26.220]  Keep good notes of your pH. Keep good notes of your EC. You may even want to measure the
[14:26.220 --> 14:31.300]  EC and pH going in and coming out of your plants if you've got that ability. That will
[14:31.300 --> 14:37.260]  help us diagnose a problem and then adjust to make corrections, especially in a hydroponic
[14:37.260 --> 14:42.220]  system. It's a little bit harder in a soilless mix because you got all that soilless stuff
[14:42.220 --> 14:46.000]  in there. You're going to get a lot of PPMs of different things. But we know exactly what
[14:46.040 --> 14:52.040]  we're putting in a hydroponic mix. Let me read my notes and see where I am. Identify
[14:52.040 --> 14:57.400]  the problem. Mix up a good feed. Yeah. Why would you starve the plants? You could just
[14:57.400 --> 15:00.840]  water them. But why would you do that? Now you're going to make them hungry also. That's
[15:00.840 --> 15:04.280]  like telling a sick person like starve for a day and then I'll try to figure out what's
[15:04.280 --> 15:08.200]  wrong with you and then we'll diagnose it and then we'll fucking fix you. No, no, don't
[15:08.200 --> 15:13.760]  make them feed. Mix up a solid feed with the appropriate things. Adjust it to the appropriate
[15:13.760 --> 15:18.000]  pH for your time in the grow and what your garden is used to. Make sure the pH is right.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.320]  Also make sure that your pH pen is correct. I saw somebody that has been adjusting their
[15:22.320 --> 15:26.200]  pH with the pen that has been miscalibrated for quite a while. So everything looked like
[15:26.200 --> 15:30.880]  shit. We thought the pH was correct. The pen was off. So it was not. Everything was way
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.000]  off. Make sure your pens are good. Then reset that soil with a good feed. When you just
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.920]  water everything into that soil with that good nutrient mix, with the good pH balance,
[15:38.920 --> 15:42.840]  you just kind of reset that soil. Those plants will start drinking all of that. They'll get
[15:42.840 --> 15:47.040]  more active and they'll start recovering. You're not going to see the burn and stuff
[15:47.040 --> 15:50.800]  is not going to go away. If you've got crispy leaves and crinkled up shit like that, it's
[15:50.800 --> 15:55.760]  not going to go away, but the new growth won't be as terrible and beat up, but you're not
[15:55.760 --> 15:59.600]  going to get rid of some of that. Don't be afraid to pull off some of those crispy, bad,
[15:59.600 --> 16:03.920]  dead, funky, ugly leaves. Those do invite more problems. The bugs kind of see those
[16:03.920 --> 16:09.360]  yellow leaves as weakness. The spider mites, that's why we use yellow sticky traps because
[16:09.440 --> 16:13.920]  bugs like spider mites and things like that see the yellow and they say that plant should
[16:13.920 --> 16:17.480]  be green, but it's yellow. So that means that little protective layer on the outside is
[16:17.480 --> 16:20.520]  probably good and weak. I can get in there and start munching and get the plant juices
[16:20.520 --> 16:25.240]  out of this. So get those yellow, funky, ugly, crinkly, crusty, dry leaves out of there.
[16:25.240 --> 16:29.240]  If you've got them, try to keep all the green, healthy foliage around. Save that, rescue
[16:29.240 --> 16:35.720]  that focus on the new stuff coming. Now let's talk about something a little bit controversial
[16:35.880 --> 16:40.520]  that honestly, this is all bro science. I do not have any science behind this. I'm going
[16:40.520 --> 16:46.400]  to tell you the honest truth. I am debating and readjusting and rethinking my stance on
[16:46.400 --> 16:50.920]  flushing our cannabis plants. I don't have enough real scientific data. I don't have
[16:50.920 --> 16:57.600]  the scientific machines to do this. All I can tell you is by burning it, by smoking
[16:57.600 --> 17:01.920]  it, by consuming it, by extracting it, by enjoying it or not enjoying it. That's the
[17:01.920 --> 17:07.960]  only testing that I've got and that's kind of what matters because I've never had some
[17:07.960 --> 17:14.680]  lab equipment tell me that my weed was good or bad. So let's talk about flushing. Flushing.
[17:14.680 --> 17:18.960]  And this is the end of harvest or the end of the cycle pre-harvest flushing. We've been
[17:18.960 --> 17:23.520]  feeding our plants for nine weeks. We're going to cut down. I used to preach the flush for
[17:23.520 --> 17:28.480]  10 to 14 days. Is that necessary? I don't know. There's a lot of debate in that. My
[17:28.520 --> 17:33.880]  question is what do we think we're flushing out? Like there's a plant and there are buds
[17:33.880 --> 17:39.620]  and nutrients have been put into that plant and they've been photosynthesized or metabolized
[17:39.620 --> 17:45.400]  and turned into plant. They are fibers and terpenes and there's a bunch of different
[17:45.400 --> 17:50.200]  components to that plant. Now there are plant waxes and esters and all the different components
[17:50.200 --> 17:57.000]  of a plant. They became a plant. There's not like little nutrients. They are, but they're
[17:57.160 --> 18:02.160]  the building blocks of the plant. What are we going to flush out? I don't know. Like
[18:02.160 --> 18:06.360]  when you pee, do you like, do you think you pee out? So I don't know what we're going
[18:06.360 --> 18:10.360]  to flush out. I really don't know because I pee out waste with the building blocks of
[18:10.360 --> 18:15.800]  the food that I ate still created me. I like my, my waste comes out, but the things that
[18:15.800 --> 18:20.400]  I ate and consumed that created me are still here and you're not going to flush a lot of
[18:20.400 --> 18:27.320]  that out. So if you were to consume me, you would only, you would, the waste is all that's
[18:27.320 --> 18:31.720]  coming out of me. So I think even when we flush, I see that's, and I don't have enough
[18:31.720 --> 18:36.280]  science behind it. That's my thought process on it. I'm open to feedback. I would love
[18:36.280 --> 18:41.920]  to hear your opinions, your bro science. I'd love to read your paperwork on it. Again,
[18:41.920 --> 18:47.640]  I have grown for a lot of time and a lot of environments with a lot of different mediums.
[18:47.720 --> 18:51.680]  I've had the opportunity to flush for two weeks. Sometimes we've had emergencies where
[18:51.680 --> 18:55.560]  plants didn't get to get flushed as much. Sometimes I notice a difference. Sometimes
[18:55.560 --> 19:00.360]  I don't. Sometimes I also noticed that the dry and cure really had a lot to do with it.
[19:00.360 --> 19:06.080]  So I am not sure. Um, is that white ash really telling me that it was flushed properly? Is
[19:06.080 --> 19:10.320]  the flush the right thing? I do notice that if we overfeed, the stuff doesn't burn right.
[19:10.320 --> 19:14.360]  Sometimes if you overfeed certain things, it doesn't burn right. But is flushing real?
[19:14.360 --> 19:18.800]  I really don't know. I'm still adjusting my approach to that whole thought process,
[19:18.800 --> 19:23.740]  but I want to know what are we flushing out? Like what do we actually think is coming out
[19:23.740 --> 19:29.560]  of the plant? I don't know. Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[19:29.560 --> 19:33.720]  growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out
[19:33.720 --> 19:37.400]  there. I think that is all I've got for you for this episode. This may be a quick show.
[19:37.400 --> 19:41.920]  I'm not sure how long we've been going either way. It is quality over quantity, right? I
[19:41.920 --> 19:45.960]  could ramble on and make this show longer, but we got a quick talk about flushing. We
[19:45.960 --> 19:49.940]  got to talk about the discord and stuff at the top of the show. I want to thank you again
[19:49.940 --> 19:53.520]  for listening to another great episode of the girl from your heart podcast. I did have
[19:53.520 --> 19:57.960]  fun recording this one. I do enjoy doing this show. I'm in my own little bubble here. I
[19:57.960 --> 20:01.880]  got my headphones on, can't hear the doorbell, can't hear nothing around me. Couldn't hear
[20:01.880 --> 20:05.960]  the phone ring. If it did, I like it. I enjoy being in the zone here. I love knowing that
[20:05.960 --> 20:10.200]  I'm helping people out. So thank you for giving me the opportunity to teach you stuff, some
[20:10.400 --> 20:16.000]  stuff today. I do look forward to your feedback about flushing. If you've got questions, corrections,
[20:16.000 --> 20:21.440]  comments, concerns, feedback of any sort is invited. The email address for the podcast
