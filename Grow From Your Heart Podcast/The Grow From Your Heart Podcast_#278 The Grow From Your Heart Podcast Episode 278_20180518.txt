[00:21.000 --> 00:23.000]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.000]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  Before you going back.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.000]  Way back.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  Hit it.
[00:33.000 --> 00:34.000]  Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  It's Thursday and that means it's time for another Throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  Before we get to the old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  If I mention any advertising, any giveaways, any promotions or any contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  I want to thank you guys for listening.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  And with no further ado, here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:17.260 --> 01:18.260]  Yeah, welcome back Cannabis Community.
[01:18.260 --> 01:22.260]  It's time for episode number 166 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:22.260 --> 01:25.260]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:25.260 --> 01:26.260]  That's right.
[01:26.260 --> 01:30.260]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:30.260 --> 01:34.260]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:34.260 --> 01:37.260]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:38.260 --> 01:40.260]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeGiova.
[01:40.260 --> 01:41.260]  Thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:41.260 --> 01:45.260]  As always, I want to give a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band,
[01:45.260 --> 01:47.260]  flooding me with their music on my podcast.
[01:47.260 --> 01:50.260]  Big thanks to Kat Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:50.260 --> 01:54.260]  Also, congratulations on the little one that's coming up soon, you guys.
[01:54.260 --> 01:55.260]  Proud of you. I'm excited for you.
[01:55.260 --> 01:57.260]  Much love in that family.
[01:57.260 --> 01:59.260]  A whole bunch of positive folks in that family.
[01:59.260 --> 02:01.260]  You guys, I'm proud of Lindsay also.
[02:01.260 --> 02:03.260]  Across the table, she just mouthed the entire intro perfectly.
[02:03.260 --> 02:05.260]  You've nailed it two or three times now. I'm proud of you.
[02:05.260 --> 02:07.260]  I send you videos all the time of me nailing it.
[02:07.260 --> 02:12.260]  Oh my God, you sent me a video of us face swapped doing the video,
[02:12.260 --> 02:14.260]  and I almost had a nervous breakdown.
[02:14.260 --> 02:16.260]  It was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen.
[02:16.260 --> 02:18.260]  It was creepy as fuck for some reason.
[02:18.260 --> 02:19.260]  It's my favorite video.
[02:19.260 --> 02:20.260]  Oh my God.
[02:20.260 --> 02:22.260]  All right, let's do some introductions.
[02:22.260 --> 02:23.260]  I saw it. LOL.
[02:23.260 --> 02:24.260]  You saw it?
[02:24.260 --> 02:27.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, that lovely voice you just heard to the left of me is the dabbing granny.
[02:27.260 --> 02:28.260]  Welcome back to the show, honey.
[02:28.260 --> 02:29.260]  Thanks, Jeff.
[02:29.260 --> 02:31.260]  Hey, thanks for driving all the way from Colorado Springs to Pueblo to join us.
[02:31.260 --> 02:32.260]  Oh my God, it's so far.
[02:32.260 --> 02:34.260]  We're not going to have any tech issues.
[02:34.260 --> 02:35.260]  No tech issues this time.
[02:35.260 --> 02:37.260]  I did not take any gear.
[02:37.260 --> 02:38.260]  We're doing it at the home studio.
[02:38.260 --> 02:39.260]  Everything works beautifully.
[02:39.260 --> 02:40.260]  I love it. It's great.
[02:40.260 --> 02:41.260]  Thank you for coming.
[02:41.260 --> 02:45.260]  Granny brought an Easter basket filled with turps, hash.
[02:45.260 --> 02:47.260]  Everybody at the table got a gift.
[02:47.260 --> 02:50.260]  People that are not at the table that are going to be here later got gifts.
[02:50.260 --> 02:53.260]  She's got green crack terpenes.
[02:53.260 --> 02:56.260]  She has got sleeping monkey hash.
[02:56.260 --> 02:59.260]  There is some Panama punch on the table.
[02:59.260 --> 03:01.260]  There's some blue dream.
[03:01.260 --> 03:02.260]  Turpy, slurpy.
[03:02.260 --> 03:03.260]  There's some blue dream over here.
[03:03.260 --> 03:05.260]  We had a little conversation about the blue dream.
[03:05.260 --> 03:06.260]  There's some solventless hash.
[03:06.260 --> 03:08.260]  Some clementine.
[03:08.260 --> 03:12.260]  I was gifted a sweet new pencil dabber from our friend Tater Glass.
[03:12.260 --> 03:13.260]  It is a UV reactive.
[03:13.260 --> 03:14.260]  It's clear.
[03:14.260 --> 03:16.260]  It's UV reactive on one end.
[03:16.260 --> 03:21.260]  It has got like a cobalt baby blue, which is actually honestly one of my favorite colors if you know much about me.
[03:21.260 --> 03:22.260]  The tip has got some blue in it.
[03:22.260 --> 03:25.260]  It's also already got a little piece of hair in the reclaim that's stuck to it.
[03:25.260 --> 03:27.260]  I don't know how our lives are so hairy, but that's how it goes.
[03:27.260 --> 03:31.260]  So shout out to Tater Glass and Granny for hooking me up with this sweet new pencil dabber.
[03:31.260 --> 03:32.260]  I love it.
[03:32.260 --> 03:33.260]  It's beautiful.
[03:33.260 --> 03:34.260]  Thank you guys.
[03:34.260 --> 03:35.260]  I love it.
[03:35.260 --> 03:36.260]  Honestly, it's one of my favorite colors.
[03:36.260 --> 03:41.260]  That's similar to my daughter's eyes color, but honestly, that was one of my favorite colors before she even was born.
[03:41.260 --> 03:44.260]  I'm glad I got to show you the UV.
[03:44.260 --> 03:45.260]  Yes, that was awesome.
[03:45.260 --> 03:46.260]  Granny carries around a UV light.
[03:46.260 --> 03:50.260]  You guys, if you've got UV reflective glass, it's a new reactive glass.
[03:50.260 --> 03:51.260]  It's a new thing.
[03:51.260 --> 03:52.260]  We talked about it on the show.
[03:52.260 --> 03:58.260]  It's pretty much a black light, but you hold the rig underneath this little light Granny's got, and if it's got UV in there, Illuminati glass, it will glow.
[03:58.260 --> 04:00.260]  It's dope as fuck.
[04:00.260 --> 04:01.260]  I love it.
[04:01.260 --> 04:02.260]  I love the way she carries that around.
[04:02.260 --> 04:05.260]  She's got a literal Easter basket full of treats.
[04:05.260 --> 04:06.260]  It's Granny's basket.
[04:06.260 --> 04:07.260]  Granny's basket.
[04:07.260 --> 04:08.260]  I love it.
[04:08.260 --> 04:09.260]  I love it.
[04:09.260 --> 04:10.260]  Shout out for coming all the way from Springs.
[04:10.260 --> 04:11.260]  I appreciate that.
[04:11.260 --> 04:12.260]  Again, thanks.
[04:12.260 --> 04:14.260]  Also in front of me is the lovely Traveling Stoner, Miss Lindsey.
[04:14.260 --> 04:15.260]  Welcome back, Boo Boo.
[04:15.260 --> 04:16.260]  Thank you for having me.
[04:16.260 --> 04:17.260]  Always.
[04:17.260 --> 04:18.260]  I told you you could be on the next one.
[04:18.260 --> 04:19.260]  Yes.
[04:19.260 --> 04:21.260]  And then over here, a quiet guy, but he'll talk a couple times.
[04:21.260 --> 04:22.260]  Yes, yes.
[04:22.260 --> 04:23.260]  Hello, hello.
[04:23.260 --> 04:24.260]  Mr. Bobo Blastico, also known as Chris.
[04:24.260 --> 04:25.260]  What up, everyone?
[04:25.260 --> 04:28.260]  The Traveling Stoner's better half, the one that keeps you in line.
[04:29.260 --> 04:30.260]  Check, keeper, check somehow.
[04:30.260 --> 04:31.260]  Yes, yes.
[04:31.260 --> 04:36.260]  You guys follow Bobo Blastico on Instagram because he has started making glass gnome carb caps.
[04:36.260 --> 04:39.260]  Yes, I'm starting to dabble in the glass game.
[04:39.260 --> 04:40.260]  Yes, dude.
[04:40.260 --> 04:41.260]  You are a hell of an artist.
[04:41.260 --> 04:42.260]  You were a tattooist before I knew you.
[04:42.260 --> 04:45.260]  Yes, I've been doing art for a long time.
[04:45.260 --> 04:46.260]  You've got that art thing.
[04:46.260 --> 04:47.260]  I do all types of crap.
[04:47.260 --> 04:48.260]  Yes, you paint.
[04:48.260 --> 04:51.260]  I do a lot of clay sculpting.
[04:51.260 --> 04:55.260]  So glass is kind of like second nature, but it's really fun and really interesting.
[04:55.260 --> 04:56.260]  You're good at it, bro.
[04:56.260 --> 04:58.260]  I see you excelling quickly, so good work.
[04:58.260 --> 04:59.260]  Thank you.
[04:59.260 --> 05:00.260]  That's what everybody keeps telling me.
[05:00.260 --> 05:02.260]  Little homie gnomies he's making.
[05:02.260 --> 05:04.260]  Yeah, and you just started a glass account.
[05:04.260 --> 05:05.260]  Yeah, I did.
[05:05.260 --> 05:10.260]  Yeah, check out at gnome, N-O-M-E, glass.
[05:10.260 --> 05:11.260]  All right, gnome glass.
[05:11.260 --> 05:12.260]  Check it out, you guys.
[05:12.260 --> 05:16.260]  Follow him because he makes cool glass, little gnome carb caps.
[05:16.260 --> 05:17.260]  We got some cool ideas for him, too.
[05:17.260 --> 05:18.260]  There's stuff coming up in the future.
[05:18.260 --> 05:20.260]  Watch the progress.
[05:20.260 --> 05:24.260]  Jump in now while he's new and then you can see him get better and better and better.
[05:24.260 --> 05:26.260]  Is that a gaba glass pendant you're rocking there?
[05:26.260 --> 05:27.260]  That is.
[05:27.260 --> 05:28.260]  Dude, that is dope.
[05:28.260 --> 05:29.260]  That is sweet.
[05:29.260 --> 05:30.260]  Goba?
[05:30.260 --> 05:31.260]  I don't know how to say it.
[05:31.260 --> 05:32.260]  I believe it's goba.
[05:32.260 --> 05:33.260]  I'll give you goba.
[05:33.260 --> 05:34.260]  I believe it's goba.
[05:34.260 --> 05:35.260]  I like to say gaba.
[05:35.260 --> 05:36.260]  I don't know.
[05:36.260 --> 05:37.260]  I know Joey.
[05:37.260 --> 05:38.260]  I hope I didn't butcher his name right now.
[05:38.260 --> 05:40.260]  Yeah, he's wearing a pendant that actually has cannabis seeds inside of it and then it's
[05:40.260 --> 05:41.260]  got a little bee on the outside.
[05:41.260 --> 05:42.260]  Yeah, they're encapsulated.
[05:42.260 --> 05:43.260]  They're lemon-stemmed seeds.
[05:43.260 --> 05:44.260]  Lemon cross seeds.
[05:44.260 --> 05:45.260]  Nice.
[05:45.260 --> 05:46.260]  Nice.
[05:46.260 --> 05:47.260]  I've got one with silver 99 seeds in it.
[05:47.260 --> 05:48.260]  Nice.
[05:48.260 --> 05:50.260]  It doesn't have the drips or the stuff on it.
[05:50.260 --> 05:52.260]  It's just the straight up pendee with the seeds.
[05:52.260 --> 05:53.260]  Yeah, these are nice.
[05:53.260 --> 05:57.260]  These are nice little pinata pendants because worst comes to worst, if it breaks, you have
[05:57.260 --> 05:58.260]  a present afterwards.
[05:58.260 --> 05:59.260]  Oh, it's bad luck.
[05:59.260 --> 06:00.260]  Oh.
[06:00.260 --> 06:01.260]  Or it's a good end of the world scenario.
[06:01.260 --> 06:02.260]  There you go.
[06:02.260 --> 06:06.260]  If you're on a flight and you crash and you're on an island, now you've got cannabis seeds.
[06:06.260 --> 06:07.260]  That's all I need.
[06:07.260 --> 06:08.260]  That's all you need?
[06:08.260 --> 06:09.260]  That's all I need.
[06:09.260 --> 06:12.260]  If I land on a fucking deserted island that's got a little bit of water nearby that I can
[06:12.260 --> 06:16.260]  take the salt out of and we got some soil that I can put some salt into, bro, we can
[06:16.260 --> 06:17.260]  make this happen.
[06:17.260 --> 06:20.260]  I am never leaving the house without that pendant again.
[06:21.260 --> 06:24.260]  One thing, if it's got a hole in it, because I'm pretty sure it's got a hole in it because
[06:24.260 --> 06:28.260]  the way that he makes his glass, don't wear it in the shower because your seeds will germinate.
[06:28.260 --> 06:29.260]  Oh man.
[06:29.260 --> 06:30.260]  For real?
[06:30.260 --> 06:33.260]  Well, all that moisture, the humidity in the shower, you'll get water in there eventually
[06:33.260 --> 06:36.260]  and it just takes a little tiny bit of water to germinate some seeds.
[06:36.260 --> 06:37.260]  Oh, I wonder.
[06:37.260 --> 06:38.260]  And that'll be a warm place.
[06:38.260 --> 06:41.260]  That'd be cool to see, to actually watch and see what it would do.
[06:41.260 --> 06:43.260]  See it somehow try to grow out of it.
[06:43.260 --> 06:46.260]  All right, Joey, you got to send us another one so that we can...
[06:46.260 --> 06:48.260]  We'll have a science project here.
[06:48.260 --> 06:51.260]  I'll just get some seeds and put them in a vial and poke a little hole in it and we'll
[06:51.260 --> 06:52.260]  watch what happens.
[06:52.260 --> 06:55.260]  All right, let's do a podcast, you guys.
[06:55.260 --> 06:56.260]  Today is Cause for Celebration.
[06:56.260 --> 06:58.260]  I was going to say we should all take a dab.
[06:58.260 --> 06:59.260]  You guys take a dab.
[06:59.260 --> 07:00.260]  I'll keep talking.
[07:00.260 --> 07:04.260]  Today is the dabbing granny's one year anniversary.
[07:04.260 --> 07:05.260]  Yes, it is.
[07:05.260 --> 07:07.260]  I've been on social media for one year.
[07:07.260 --> 07:08.260]  I forgot about this.
[07:08.260 --> 07:12.260]  I find it quite amazing that you have come this far in one year.
[07:12.260 --> 07:14.260]  How many Instagram followers have you got?
[07:14.260 --> 07:17.260]  This morning, it was 215,000.
[07:17.260 --> 07:20.260]  You guys, you didn't hear the microphone smack against my forehead.
[07:20.260 --> 07:21.260]  Let me do it a little harder.
[07:21.260 --> 07:24.260]  Yes, 215,000.
[07:24.260 --> 07:25.260]  It makes no sense to me.
[07:25.260 --> 07:26.260]  That's amazing.
[07:26.260 --> 07:27.260]  In one year.
[07:27.260 --> 07:28.260]  Yeah, in a year.
[07:28.260 --> 07:29.260]  I had an account with 19,000.
[07:29.260 --> 07:32.260]  It got deleted and now I'm almost back to 10,000.
[07:32.260 --> 07:35.260]  I would give myself credit for 25,000 followers, you know what I'm saying?
[07:35.260 --> 07:36.260]  Yeah, that's a nice solid.
[07:36.260 --> 07:38.260]  Yeah, she's got 10 times what I've got.
[07:38.260 --> 07:39.260]  That's awesome.
[07:39.260 --> 07:40.260]  But it's not just...
[07:40.260 --> 07:42.260]  It's people from all over the world.
[07:42.260 --> 07:43.260]  Yeah.
[07:43.260 --> 07:46.260]  When I was doing the Periscope, I did a gram dab for celebration.
[07:46.260 --> 07:47.260]  Come on and watch me on Periscope.
[07:47.260 --> 07:50.260]  You took a gram dab at around 420 this afternoon, wasn't it?
[07:50.260 --> 07:51.260]  Yeah, I was.
[07:51.260 --> 07:55.260]  Did you see the person came in from Russia talking, you know,
[07:55.260 --> 07:57.260]  we're so glad Trump is the president, you know,
[07:57.260 --> 07:59.260]  if there would have been World War, if Hillary...
[07:59.260 --> 08:04.260]  And I was like, I know your leader really felt that way and okay,
[08:04.260 --> 08:10.260]  but I think it's amazing that people from Russia come to watch the dabbing granny dab.
[08:10.260 --> 08:12.260]  Yeah, that is pretty amazing.
[08:12.260 --> 08:14.260]  So you took a gram dab at 420.
[08:14.260 --> 08:17.260]  Here it is, 820 right now and you're in damn good shape.
[08:17.260 --> 08:18.260]  Well, thank you.
[08:18.260 --> 08:19.260]  Yeah.
[08:19.260 --> 08:21.260]  I've been dabbing since about 6 o'clock this morning.
[08:21.260 --> 08:25.260]  I saw your video this morning when you were talking about you were excited to come be on the podcast.
[08:25.260 --> 08:26.260]  That was early this morning.
[08:26.260 --> 08:28.260]  That's when you replied to one of my Instagram messages.
[08:28.260 --> 08:29.260]  Yep.
[08:29.260 --> 08:30.260]  Yep.
[08:30.260 --> 08:31.260]  So yeah, this lady can dab, you guys.
[08:31.260 --> 08:32.260]  She can keep up with you.
[08:32.260 --> 08:33.260]  She can probably out dab you.
[08:33.260 --> 08:36.260]  She probably has more terps and better terps than you do.
[08:36.260 --> 08:37.260]  She showed up with gifts too.
[08:37.260 --> 08:38.260]  I mean, you can't beat that.
[08:38.260 --> 08:41.260]  So one year, are you on YouTube?
[08:41.260 --> 08:43.260]  I am on YouTube.
[08:43.260 --> 08:47.260]  I don't have a huge following on YouTube, but I have a very loyal following.
[08:47.260 --> 08:48.260]  Okay.
[08:48.260 --> 08:51.260]  It's like granny's reality TV.
[08:51.260 --> 08:53.260]  They ask a lot of questions about my family and stuff.
[08:53.260 --> 08:59.260]  So they know that I've evolved and I don't have an hour every morning to wake and bake.
[08:59.260 --> 09:06.260]  So if I do a YouTube once a week, they're happy to have my little presence there and I just find it incredible.
[09:06.260 --> 09:09.260]  Can they find you, can my listeners find you just by searching for dabbing granny?
[09:09.260 --> 09:10.260]  Yeah.
[09:10.260 --> 09:11.260]  Okay.
[09:11.260 --> 09:15.260]  So I'm dabbing on most of my social medias are dabbing underscore granny.
[09:15.260 --> 09:16.260]  All right.
[09:16.260 --> 09:25.260]  So I'm on YouTube, Periscope, Instagram, Facebook, and I'm liking Facebook again and people are finding me.
[09:25.260 --> 09:28.260]  I like that live streaming and I like the intimacy of Facebook.
[09:28.260 --> 09:31.260]  Like Periscope, my room fills up pretty quickly.
[09:31.260 --> 09:32.260]  Yeah.
[09:32.260 --> 09:33.260]  Couple hundred people real quickly.
[09:33.260 --> 09:36.260]  Facebook might be 10, 15 people.
[09:36.260 --> 09:37.260]  Okay.
[09:37.260 --> 09:39.260]  And we can have nice conversations.
[09:39.260 --> 09:42.260]  But you know, the people on Facebook is what I like better about the Facebook live.
[09:42.260 --> 09:43.260]  I don't yet.
[09:43.260 --> 09:44.260]  Okay.
[09:44.260 --> 09:46.260]  I know more people on Periscope because I've been doing it longer.
[09:46.260 --> 09:49.260]  I only have Facebook friends on my Facebook account.
[09:49.260 --> 09:52.260]  It's mostly people that I know personally that I've hung out with.
[09:52.260 --> 09:54.260]  So when I go Facebook live, it's all my bros.
[09:54.260 --> 09:55.260]  It's these guys.
[09:55.260 --> 09:56.260]  And so that's a lot of fun.
[09:56.260 --> 09:57.260]  No, not for me.
[09:57.260 --> 09:58.260]  Happy one year.
[09:58.260 --> 10:00.260]  That's a one year dab right there happening.
[10:00.260 --> 10:01.260]  Oh, look at it.
[10:01.260 --> 10:02.260]  Look at my friend, the traveling.
[10:02.260 --> 10:03.260]  She's got a nice chunky dab there.
[10:03.260 --> 10:05.260]  She's throwing a carb cap on.
[10:05.260 --> 10:07.260]  She's hitting the sweet rig from our friends at Elevate Glass.
[10:07.260 --> 10:10.260]  Big shout out to our friend Becca and everybody over at Elevate Glass.
[10:10.260 --> 10:11.260]  All the lovely Elevate dolls.
[10:11.260 --> 10:14.260]  I'm going to share a secret about the traveling stoner and I.
[10:14.260 --> 10:15.260]  Uh-oh.
[10:15.260 --> 10:16.260]  Yes, I'm going to.
[10:16.260 --> 10:17.260]  She's like, oh, what the hell?
[10:17.260 --> 10:18.260]  I bet it's on my list.
[10:18.260 --> 10:19.260]  It's on my list of notes.
[10:19.260 --> 10:21.260]  For breast cancer month.
[10:21.260 --> 10:22.260]  Here we go.
[10:22.260 --> 10:25.260]  The traveling stoner and I went and had our nipples pierced.
[10:25.260 --> 10:27.260]  Yes, we did.
[10:27.260 --> 10:30.260]  It was probably one of the most painful things I've been through in a while.
[10:31.260 --> 10:37.260]  So these lovely ladies went and got their nipples pierced to raise awareness for breast cancer.
[10:37.260 --> 10:38.260]  You guys, that is some dedication.
[10:38.260 --> 10:40.260]  These are some bad-ass women.
[10:40.260 --> 10:44.260]  I'll tell you, this is truly, I didn't do it for like, oh, let's go get a tattoo or a piercing.
[10:44.260 --> 10:48.260]  This is the way I thought about it because I know some people that have breast cancer.
[10:48.260 --> 10:51.260]  And I thought it's breast cancer awareness month.
[10:51.260 --> 10:53.260]  And somebody shared some stories with me.
[10:53.260 --> 10:55.260]  And I thought, you know what?
[10:55.260 --> 10:59.260]  If you have breast cancer and you're going through chemotherapy, god dang.
[10:59.260 --> 11:03.260]  Life probably sucks and every day is a battle.
[11:03.260 --> 11:08.260]  Just having your mammogram done is an uncomfortable experience for any woman.
[11:08.260 --> 11:09.260]  It just is.
[11:09.260 --> 11:10.260]  You go get your boobs squished?
[11:10.260 --> 11:11.260]  Yeah.
[11:11.260 --> 11:12.260]  Yeah, I've heard about that.
[11:12.260 --> 11:13.260]  And so I was like, come on, Lindsay, let's do it.
[11:13.260 --> 11:15.260]  What's a few minutes of pain compared to some?
[11:15.260 --> 11:17.260]  How do they do it if you don't have a boob?
[11:17.260 --> 11:19.260]  Like if you're lacking in the boob region, what do they squish?
[11:19.260 --> 11:20.260]  I don't know.
[11:20.260 --> 11:22.260]  What do they go for?
[11:22.260 --> 11:23.260]  Like for mammograms you mean?
[11:23.260 --> 11:24.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:24.260 --> 11:26.260]  I know, I just took a weird turn on this.
[11:26.260 --> 11:27.260]  I was just like, well, how do you?
[11:27.260 --> 11:29.260]  I thought you were talking about the piercing for a second.
[11:29.260 --> 11:30.260]  No, no, no.
[11:30.260 --> 11:31.260]  It's not through the boob, it's through the nipple.
[11:31.260 --> 11:33.260]  Yeah, no, god, oh, Jesus.
[11:33.260 --> 11:34.260]  That's what I was like.
[11:34.260 --> 11:36.260]  Just went right through the whole thing.
[11:36.260 --> 11:38.260]  That's what I was like, I don't know what you think we did, but.
[11:41.260 --> 11:42.260]  You're higher than me.
[11:44.260 --> 11:45.260]  It's been a long day.
[11:45.260 --> 11:47.260]  Okay, sorry, I did not mean to throw you off course there.
[11:47.260 --> 11:48.260]  You were on a path.
[11:48.260 --> 11:50.260]  Now I lost my train of thought.
[11:50.260 --> 11:52.260]  So we did it because.
[11:52.260 --> 11:54.260]  You didn't want to go get a tattoo or.
[11:54.260 --> 11:55.260]  No, I didn't want to get a tattoo.
[11:55.260 --> 11:56.260]  I mean, really, I didn't.
[11:57.260 --> 11:58.260]  And I will share something personal.
[11:59.260 --> 12:01.260]  I've been married to my husband for over 40 years.
[12:03.260 --> 12:04.260]  Almost 45.
[12:05.260 --> 12:06.260]  I know my husband very well.
[12:07.260 --> 12:09.260]  I knew he would not approve.
[12:09.260 --> 12:12.260]  Some of you would be like, oh, but wouldn't every man like their woman's nipples pierced?
[12:13.260 --> 12:15.260]  No, my husband is very conservative about your body.
[12:17.260 --> 12:18.260]  So I didn't tell him.
[12:18.260 --> 12:20.260]  He knew I was hanging out with Lindsay.
[12:20.260 --> 12:23.260]  He knew what was going on, but I did not tell him.
[12:23.260 --> 12:25.260]  And I thought if I tell him immediately, he'll say, take him out.
[12:26.260 --> 12:28.260]  So I waited a few days and he knows how bad a piercing hurts.
[12:30.260 --> 12:31.260]  So this is how I told him.
[12:32.260 --> 12:34.260]  He was sitting in his chair and I had fun band-aids, didn't I?
[12:35.260 --> 12:36.260]  Traveling stoner.
[12:37.260 --> 12:38.260]  I had the band-aid.
[12:38.260 --> 12:39.260]  Okay, so I put on.
[12:40.260 --> 12:41.260]  I had little round sad face.
[12:42.260 --> 12:43.260]  Emoji band-aids.
[12:44.260 --> 12:45.260]  And.
[12:46.260 --> 12:49.260]  This kind of graphic, but the round part fits over a woman's areola perfectly.
[12:49.260 --> 12:51.260]  And so he was sitting in his chair and I said, I have something to tell you.
[12:52.260 --> 12:53.260]  And he said, what?
[12:54.260 --> 12:55.260]  Oh my God, I know you're not going to like it.
[12:56.260 --> 12:57.260]  And he was like, what did you do now?
[12:59.260 --> 13:02.260]  And I lifted my shirt and there was them two sad faces looking at him.
[13:03.260 --> 13:04.260]  And he said.
[13:05.260 --> 13:07.260]  You are not 25 years old like those kids you're hanging out with.
[13:08.260 --> 13:10.260]  And I said, but it was to raise breast cancer awareness.
[13:11.260 --> 13:12.260]  He said, I don't want to hear your rationalization.
[13:13.260 --> 13:14.260]  I said, I don't want to hear your rationalization.
[13:15.260 --> 13:16.260]  And I said, I don't want to hear your rationalization.
[13:16.260 --> 13:17.260]  And he said, but it was to raise breast cancer awareness.
[13:18.260 --> 13:19.260]  He said, I don't want to hear your rationalization.
[13:20.260 --> 13:21.260]  No, I don't like it.
[13:22.260 --> 13:23.260]  But yeah, it does look kind of cute.
[13:26.260 --> 13:27.260]  And then it's a win-win for everybody.
[13:28.260 --> 13:29.260]  That's right.
[13:29.260 --> 13:30.260]  Lindsay wouldn't let me give her a hug for like a week and a half.
[13:31.260 --> 13:32.260]  I wouldn't let anybody.
[13:33.260 --> 13:34.260]  They hurt.
[13:35.260 --> 13:36.260]  I wanted to sleep on the couch for a week.
[13:37.260 --> 13:42.260]  Every like the dogs and like even the sheets would get shit.
[13:43.260 --> 13:44.260]  No.
[13:44.260 --> 13:45.260]  I was putting on a shirt and be like, oh, wait too fast.
[13:46.260 --> 13:47.260]  Too fast.
[13:48.260 --> 13:49.260]  The other day I was putting on a onesie really fast and I zipped it up and I was like, oh my God.
[13:50.260 --> 13:51.260]  And Chris was like, oh, I saw that.
[13:52.260 --> 13:53.260]  That one hurt.
[13:54.260 --> 13:55.260]  My German Shepherd jumped up on me.
[13:56.260 --> 13:57.260]  I got a titty twister.
[13:58.260 --> 14:01.260]  Just when the left arm was almost healed and it was like 360.
[14:02.260 --> 14:03.260]  Oh gosh.
[14:04.260 --> 14:05.260]  All right.
[14:06.260 --> 14:07.260]  I'll do it the next time.
[14:08.260 --> 14:09.260]  I might need a dab after all of this.
[14:10.260 --> 14:11.260]  You know, when we were talking about breast cancer,
[14:11.260 --> 14:12.260]  I was going to talk, I was going to mention like you put a lot of your life out there.
[14:13.260 --> 14:14.260]  Aren't you like, don't you want to keep anything to yourself?
[14:15.260 --> 14:16.260]  But I don't even need to ask that question because you don't give a shit.
[14:17.260 --> 14:18.260]  No, I don't.
[14:19.260 --> 14:20.260]  What have I really got to, you know, secrets are bad.
[14:21.260 --> 14:22.260]  That means something dirty or, or bad.
[14:23.260 --> 14:24.260]  And I don't think anything I've done in my life is really dirty or bad.
[14:25.260 --> 14:26.260]  Everything's been a learning experience and I'll share it with you.
[14:27.260 --> 14:28.260]  And hopefully you'll learn.
[14:29.260 --> 14:30.260]  If I, I was young and dumb once I did some stupid things that young and dumb people do.
[14:31.260 --> 14:32.260]  So I'm not going to lie.
[14:33.260 --> 14:34.260]  I'm not going to lie.
[14:35.260 --> 14:36.260]  I'm not going to lie.
[14:37.260 --> 14:38.260]  I'm not going to lie.
[14:39.260 --> 14:40.260]  I'm not going to lie.
[14:41.260 --> 14:42.260]  I'm not dumb, not dumb.
[14:43.260 --> 14:44.260]  And I'll share that with you.
[14:45.260 --> 14:48.260]  Hopefully you'll learn from the things I say because I do have a lot of experience behind me.
[14:49.260 --> 14:50.260]  I'll try to learn.
[14:51.260 --> 14:52.260]  You know exactly what I mean.
[14:53.260 --> 14:54.260]  I do.
[14:55.260 --> 14:56.260]  I do.
[14:56.260 --> 14:57.260]  I completely do.
[14:58.260 --> 14:59.260]  Yeah, I'm fine.
[15:00.260 --> 15:01.260]  Well, being a podcaster and I also used to put myself on Periscope a lot.
[15:02.260 --> 15:03.260]  I don't seem to be, I don't like sitting down as much.
[15:04.260 --> 15:05.260]  I like to be on my feet doing shit.
[15:06.260 --> 15:07.260]  Periscope makes me feel like I get anxious for some reason afterward.
[15:08.260 --> 15:09.260]  It depends on how much you're dabbing.
[15:09.260 --> 15:12.260]  I'm like, I'm like 20 or 30 minutes and I'm like, oh shit, I only meant to spend five minutes here.
[15:13.260 --> 15:14.260]  Time does get away quickly.
[15:15.260 --> 15:16.260]  It flies.
[15:17.260 --> 15:18.260]  But putting that much of myself out, I'm accountable for what I say.
[15:19.260 --> 15:23.260]  I can't fib at all because however many listeners were listening, listened, and it's on record.
[15:24.260 --> 15:25.260]  And the pod, every episode is available.
[15:26.260 --> 15:28.260]  Like I've said before, I'm going to start putting out old episodes even repeating them.
[15:29.260 --> 15:34.260]  Have you learned that the power of your words, you really sometimes have to stop and think?
[15:35.260 --> 15:36.260]  Yes.
[15:36.260 --> 15:37.260]  Because people take things literally.
[15:38.260 --> 15:39.260]  I'm really lucky that I had a starter podcast.
[15:40.260 --> 15:41.260]  I had another friend that had kind of a comedy slash community based podcast.
[15:42.260 --> 15:43.260]  Shout out to Wade Ridley.
[15:44.260 --> 15:45.260]  You guys check out Wade Ridley.
[15:46.260 --> 15:47.260]  He's a comedian.
[15:48.260 --> 15:49.260]  We had a podcast together and I kind of got to be his co-host.
[15:50.260 --> 15:53.260]  So I got to say a couple of dumb things on episodes and realize, oh, I can't say that kind of dumb shit.
[15:54.260 --> 15:55.260]  Like you have to figure it out.
[15:56.260 --> 15:57.260]  But that's how I learned was by fucking it up.
[15:58.260 --> 15:59.260]  That's why I was laughing when I said, I'll try to learn from you.
[16:00.260 --> 16:01.260]  But I mean, the more I learned, the more I learned.
[16:02.260 --> 16:03.260]  And I think that's what I learned.
[16:03.260 --> 16:04.260]  I learned that I'm very accountable for the things I say because so many people do watch me.
[16:05.260 --> 16:06.260]  We have to be.
[16:07.260 --> 16:08.260]  And you said something on your social media this morning about when you become as known as you are, you, you, you, you, you way more than myself.
[16:09.260 --> 16:10.260]  But everybody at this table has a little bit of notice.
[16:11.260 --> 16:12.260]  But you've got 10 times what we've got.
[16:13.260 --> 16:14.260]  When you get to your level of Insta celebrity or Insta fame.
[16:15.260 --> 16:16.260]  I called it Insta famous.
[16:17.260 --> 16:18.260]  Yeah.
[16:19.260 --> 16:20.260]  I mean, I'm not going to lie.
[16:21.260 --> 16:22.260]  I'm not going to lie.
[16:23.260 --> 16:24.260]  I'm not going to lie.
[16:25.260 --> 16:26.260]  I'm not going to lie.
[16:27.260 --> 16:28.260]  I'm not going to lie.
[16:29.260 --> 16:30.260]  I'm not going to lie.
[16:31.260 --> 16:32.260]  I'm not going to lie.
[16:33.260 --> 16:34.260]  I'm not going to lie.
[16:35.260 --> 16:36.260]  Yeah, it's slightly Insta famous.
[16:37.260 --> 16:38.260]  You've got to pay attention to what you say and who you talk to and what you share.
[16:39.260 --> 16:40.260]  And what you get caught up in.
[16:41.260 --> 16:42.260]  Yes.
[16:43.260 --> 16:44.260]  Yes.
[16:44.260 --> 16:45.260]  Absolutely.
[16:46.260 --> 16:47.260]  It's so much easier to get caught up in shit when you've got 250,000 people in your hair.
[16:48.260 --> 16:49.260]  Just in our cannabis community alone.
[16:50.260 --> 16:51.260]  Just in this small community.
[16:52.260 --> 16:53.260]  Absolutely.
[16:54.260 --> 16:55.260]  I catch myself in it.
[16:56.260 --> 16:57.260]  I catch myself.
[16:58.260 --> 16:59.260]  Everybody's choosing sides all the time in this industry.
[17:00.260 --> 17:01.260]  And it seems like we're all just a bunch of potheads having fun.
[17:01.260 --> 17:02.260]  We should all be united.
[17:03.260 --> 17:04.260]  There shouldn't be any backstabbing.
[17:05.260 --> 17:06.260]  And I don't have time for pettiness.
[17:07.260 --> 17:08.260]  No.
[17:09.260 --> 17:10.260]  No, we're getting too old.
[17:11.260 --> 17:12.260]  These kids are too old for that shit too already.
[17:13.260 --> 17:14.260]  And I think all these young people will learn.
[17:15.260 --> 17:16.260]  Don't get...
[17:17.260 --> 17:18.260]  Jeff, maybe you said something shitty about Bobo Blaster over there.
[17:19.260 --> 17:20.260]  You know?
[17:21.260 --> 17:22.260]  That was mean.
[17:23.260 --> 17:24.260]  Granny, you know?
[17:25.260 --> 17:26.260]  He's just a rotten person.
[17:27.260 --> 17:28.260]  Well, I'm learning that some of these kids will take what you said to heart.
[17:29.260 --> 17:30.260]  Bobo Blaster over there might be a damn good person.
[17:31.260 --> 17:32.260]  But you have a personal vendetta because some girl you liked, he liked.
[17:33.260 --> 17:34.260]  Yeah.
[17:35.260 --> 17:36.260]  He said, she said bullshit.
[17:37.260 --> 17:38.260]  No, I'm messing up his glass business and taking money off of their table.
[17:39.260 --> 17:40.260]  And I'm just using you as an example.
[17:41.260 --> 17:42.260]  You know that.
[17:43.260 --> 17:44.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:45.260 --> 17:46.260]  Chris is awesome.
[17:47.260 --> 17:48.260]  We have no beef ever.
[17:49.260 --> 17:50.260]  So unless somebody's done me wrong, you can gossip and talk about somebody all you want.
[17:51.260 --> 17:52.260]  Rest assured, Granny is not going to listen to your bullshit.
[17:53.260 --> 17:54.260]  I'm old enough and wise enough to make my own decisions about people.
[17:55.260 --> 17:56.260]  You told me earlier that you just trust your gut and your gut is the only thing that's going to change.
[17:57.260 --> 17:58.260]  I'm not going to listen to your bullshit.
[17:59.260 --> 18:00.260]  I'm not going to listen to your bullshit.
[18:01.260 --> 18:02.260]  You're 90% of the time.
[18:03.260 --> 18:04.260]  You're right is what I think you said.
[18:05.260 --> 18:06.260]  I agree with that.
[18:07.260 --> 18:08.260]  My gut usually is a pretty good judge of what I should and shouldn't do with other folks.
[18:09.260 --> 18:10.260]  I think Lindsay's the same way.
[18:11.260 --> 18:12.260]  Secrets don't make friends, you guys.
[18:13.260 --> 18:14.260]  What's happening over there?
[18:15.260 --> 18:16.260]  I was just asking if he'd eat up the nail for me.
[18:17.260 --> 18:18.260]  He actually passed me a dab.
[18:19.260 --> 18:20.260]  So I'm going to grab the e-mail here and I'm going to take a dab.
[18:21.260 --> 18:22.260]  What kind of hash did you just give me?
[18:23.260 --> 18:24.260]  That was some terp slurpy.
[18:25.260 --> 18:26.260]  Some terpy slurpy.
[18:27.260 --> 18:28.260]  I'm in.
[18:29.260 --> 18:30.260]  I'm in.
[18:31.260 --> 18:32.260]  We have a really traveling stoner here.
[18:33.260 --> 18:37.260]  They came because they are going to do a food drive slash new toy drive.
[18:38.260 --> 18:39.260]  New toys, you guys.
[18:40.260 --> 18:41.260]  New toys in packages for kids.
[18:42.260 --> 18:43.260]  We'll give you an age range.
[18:44.260 --> 18:45.260]  I'll let these ladies handle it while I take this dab.
[18:46.260 --> 18:48.260]  But would one of you ladies like to tell me all about your food and toy drive?
[18:49.260 --> 18:50.260]  Go ahead.
[18:51.260 --> 18:52.260]  You talk for a while, Linds.
[18:53.260 --> 18:54.260]  Okay.
[18:55.260 --> 18:58.260]  So we have set up a food and toy drive here in Colorado Springs.
[18:58.260 --> 19:05.940]  So far, we have 17 different places as drop-off points, and at each of those locations, you'll
[19:05.940 --> 19:14.580]  be able to get some sort of special, like, deal or offer or something for bringing in
[19:14.580 --> 19:22.140]  either a canned food, excuse me, a non-expired canned food or non-perishable canned food.
[19:22.140 --> 19:23.140]  Right.
[19:23.140 --> 19:24.140]  Something y'all would eat.
[19:24.140 --> 19:25.860]  No expired garbanzo beans.
[19:25.860 --> 19:30.740]  And if you like garbanzo beans, I'm sorry.
[19:30.740 --> 19:35.220]  Or like Jeff said, a brand new toy in a packaging.
[19:35.220 --> 19:38.020]  Any age range, honestly, we don't care.
[19:38.020 --> 19:39.260]  You know, a toy is a toy.
[19:39.260 --> 19:42.860]  We're not going to put a limit on it like that.
[19:42.860 --> 19:49.300]  But yeah, if you bring in an item to one of the places that we'll list off, you can get
[19:49.300 --> 19:50.300]  a...
[19:50.300 --> 19:56.940]  And each place is doing something different, so you'll have to ask the specific place what
[19:56.940 --> 19:59.940]  they're going to do for it.
[19:59.940 --> 20:05.020]  But we'll have a flyer and everything for it that we'll be posting and stuff with each
[20:05.020 --> 20:06.860]  place that we have.
[20:06.860 --> 20:15.100]  So we have 17 places right now confirmed, and we have three spots open for places.
[20:15.820 --> 20:20.980]  Yeah, we decided to keep it at 20 because we are going to be the ones that will be going
[20:20.980 --> 20:24.020]  by the dispensaries, picking stuff up.
[20:24.020 --> 20:28.700]  I have a warehouse to store things in until we distribute them.
[20:28.700 --> 20:31.460]  And I think we picked a good organization.
[20:31.460 --> 20:36.700]  You know, we wanted to somehow keep it in the cannabis community, but this year on such
[20:36.700 --> 20:39.540]  short notice, that's just not going to happen.
[20:39.540 --> 20:44.860]  So what we have decided to do is I got in contact with the Marion House, and the Marion
[20:44.900 --> 20:50.820]  House is down on Bijou, and they feed and they clothe a lot of our homeless community.
[20:50.820 --> 20:53.580]  And to me, that's a lot of veterans.
[20:53.580 --> 20:59.540]  It's also a lot of young people moving here because of cannabis.
[20:59.540 --> 21:01.620]  You see a lot of young people down there.
[21:01.620 --> 21:02.620]  Yes.
[21:02.620 --> 21:04.340]  So I reached out to them.
[21:04.340 --> 21:07.780]  They will be happy to take anything we have.
[21:07.780 --> 21:12.500]  And then their second organization under the Marion House is called the Family Resource
[21:12.500 --> 21:17.820]  Center, and they deal with families that are totally displaced, homeless families that
[21:17.820 --> 21:21.140]  they're getting set up in apartments and stuff.
[21:21.140 --> 21:24.580]  And these are why we're saying we'll take toys because there's children involved in
[21:24.580 --> 21:27.180]  most of these cases.
[21:27.180 --> 21:32.020]  And so that's why we decided, you know, so many people think, oh, people that smoke cannabis,
[21:32.020 --> 21:33.020]  they're bad.
[21:33.020 --> 21:34.580]  They don't do anything.
[21:34.580 --> 21:35.700]  Well, guess what?
[21:35.700 --> 21:36.700]  You're wrong.
[21:36.700 --> 21:38.820]  We love giving back to our community.
[21:38.820 --> 21:39.820]  Yes.
[21:39.820 --> 21:40.900]  And we want to start small this year.
[21:40.900 --> 21:44.580]  We just want to do it in Colorado Springs, but we're hoping to have a really big turnout
[21:44.580 --> 21:49.300]  this year and be able to make it into something even bigger for next year, whether that means
[21:49.300 --> 21:54.260]  we stay in the springs and just make it bigger next year or we, you know, try to do something
[21:54.260 --> 21:55.260]  even bigger.
[21:55.260 --> 21:59.500]  But we're really excited about this and the different places.
[21:59.500 --> 22:01.500]  Do you want to list off the different places that we have?
[22:01.500 --> 22:03.380]  I'm just going to throw one more thing in there.
[22:03.380 --> 22:07.700]  Now, at first we were just going to do we had talked about money and stuff and we decided
[22:07.700 --> 22:08.700]  no.
[22:08.700 --> 22:13.660]  We're going to do all the different places that the 20 places we're going to put a gallon
[22:13.660 --> 22:18.740]  mason jar there and you can drop off gift certificates because like I say, the Family
[22:18.740 --> 22:24.220]  Resource Center, say we get enough a meal together, we get everything for their and
[22:24.220 --> 22:25.780]  this is for Christmas.
[22:25.780 --> 22:27.580]  We get their Christmas meal together.
[22:27.580 --> 22:29.660]  What if they don't have a roasting pan?
[22:29.660 --> 22:30.660]  Guess what?
[22:30.660 --> 22:34.700]  The Family Resource Center can say, here, take this gift certificate, go get what else
[22:34.700 --> 22:36.340]  you need for.
[22:36.900 --> 22:41.300]  I think the other thing we might want to include is diapers.
[22:41.300 --> 22:45.780]  I mean, diapers are really, really expensive.
[22:45.780 --> 22:51.380]  So I think we could expand, you know, the toy, diaper and food.
[22:51.380 --> 22:53.380]  Lindsay's looking at me like, God, we didn't discuss this.
[22:53.380 --> 22:57.260]  I'm like, I just had a thought.
[22:57.260 --> 22:59.660]  As long as we're doing good things, right?
[22:59.660 --> 23:00.660]  Yeah.
[23:00.660 --> 23:06.220]  Something that's not like expired or bad or something we really couldn't donate.
[23:06.220 --> 23:07.540]  Like don't be ridiculous.
[23:07.540 --> 23:09.940]  Please don't bring us like, you know.
[23:09.940 --> 23:13.120]  Go to the health food store and get some of that Amy's organic chili.
[23:13.120 --> 23:15.480]  Get some soups, shit that people want to eat.
[23:15.480 --> 23:19.460]  Like something that you can actually open and consume instead of like some green beans.
[23:19.460 --> 23:22.100]  I mean, you can do that, but who wants fucking green beans for dinner?
[23:22.100 --> 23:24.660]  Go get some soups, some Campbell's good shit, some chunky shit.
[23:24.660 --> 23:25.660]  Yeah.
[23:25.660 --> 23:28.140]  Like some, yeah, I'm a vegetarian, so I'm going to get some of that fucking veggie soup,
[23:28.140 --> 23:29.940]  but go get the meaty soup.
[23:29.940 --> 23:30.940]  We got to feed people.
[23:30.940 --> 23:31.940]  That's the idea.
[23:31.940 --> 23:33.700]  Well, then those gift certificates can be used.
[23:33.700 --> 23:36.300]  Like we're just doing non-perishables, but you need milk.
[23:36.300 --> 23:37.300]  You need butter.
[23:37.300 --> 23:38.300]  You need eggs.
[23:38.300 --> 23:39.300]  Yeah.
[23:39.300 --> 23:40.300]  Just a Walmart gift card.
[23:40.300 --> 23:41.300]  Yep.
[23:41.300 --> 23:42.300]  Yeah.
[23:42.300 --> 23:43.300]  That's where that's going to come in.
[23:43.300 --> 23:48.020]  If we had more time, we could probably solicit grocery stores and stuff for turkeys, but
[23:48.020 --> 23:49.620]  this year, not this year.
[23:49.620 --> 23:50.620]  Right.
[23:50.620 --> 23:51.620]  Next year guys.
[23:51.620 --> 23:52.620]  Yep.
[23:52.620 --> 23:53.620]  We're going to make it really, really huge.
[23:53.620 --> 23:54.620]  Yes.
[23:54.620 --> 23:57.620]  Would you prefer them wrap or not wrap the gifts for the kids?
[23:57.620 --> 23:58.620]  I say not wrap.
[23:58.860 --> 24:01.300]  We'll let the family resource center do that.
[24:01.300 --> 24:03.900]  I think we'll do this and then turn it over to them.
[24:03.900 --> 24:04.900]  Don't wrap them up, you guys.
[24:04.900 --> 24:08.100]  If you want to donate wrapping paper so that they can be wrapped, go for that, but don't
[24:08.100 --> 24:09.100]  wrap them.
[24:09.100 --> 24:11.340]  I kind of said that because I want to see what's in there so that I make sure you're
[24:11.340 --> 24:13.460]  not giving these kids a box of dicks or something.
[24:13.460 --> 24:14.460]  That's right.
[24:14.460 --> 24:18.380]  And besides that, how do you know that there's not a used toy wrapped up in there?
[24:18.380 --> 24:19.860]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[24:19.860 --> 24:25.660]  Because unfortunately, I would love to think that we're all honest, but we're not.
[24:25.660 --> 24:26.660]  Everybody out there's not honest.
[24:26.660 --> 24:27.660]  Absolutely.
[24:27.700 --> 24:31.540]  We're going to distribute the boxes next Friday.
[24:31.540 --> 24:32.540]  Isn't that correct, Lindsay?
[24:32.540 --> 24:33.540]  Sorry.
[24:33.540 --> 24:34.540]  Next Friday.
[24:34.540 --> 24:35.540]  Wasn't that our time frame?
[24:35.540 --> 24:36.540]  We were going to put them out next Friday.
[24:36.540 --> 24:37.540]  Collection boxes.
[24:37.540 --> 24:38.540]  So, okay.
[24:38.540 --> 24:39.540]  And then through the 7th.
[24:39.540 --> 24:40.540]  What will the day be on that Friday?
[24:40.540 --> 24:41.540]  Oh, this is-
[24:41.540 --> 24:42.540]  Uh oh.
[24:42.540 --> 24:43.540]  Yeah, I know.
[24:43.540 --> 24:44.540]  I done fucked up and asked the date question.
[24:44.540 --> 24:45.540]  Wait a minute.
[24:45.540 --> 24:46.540]  Wait a minute.
[24:46.540 --> 24:47.540]  It's next Friday?
[24:47.540 --> 24:48.540]  The 18th.
[24:48.540 --> 24:49.540]  And the drop off no later than December 16th.
[24:49.540 --> 24:50.540]  Yep.
[24:50.540 --> 24:51.540]  Okay.
[24:51.540 --> 24:52.540]  I'm just going to say that.
[24:52.540 --> 24:53.540]  I'm just going to say that.
[24:53.540 --> 24:54.540]  Okay.
[24:54.540 --> 24:55.540]  And then through the 7th.
[24:55.540 --> 24:56.540]  And then through the 8th.
[24:56.540 --> 24:57.540]  And then through the 9th.
[24:57.620 --> 25:00.220]  I'm just making notes because I want to make sure that this podcast comes out at the right
[25:00.220 --> 25:01.220]  time.
[25:01.220 --> 25:02.220]  I'll put this out on the 17th.
[25:02.220 --> 25:03.220]  Cool.
[25:03.220 --> 25:04.220]  Okay.
[25:04.220 --> 25:05.220]  Yes.
[25:05.220 --> 25:06.220]  Okay.
[25:06.220 --> 25:07.220]  Should I run down the drop off?
[25:07.220 --> 25:10.420]  And we're thinking about, we haven't fine tuned this.
[25:10.420 --> 25:13.500]  We're still going to kind of work on it, but we're thinking we could make this into like
[25:13.500 --> 25:17.140]  a little competition.
[25:17.140 --> 25:23.700]  Some of the drop off spots, one of them being Elevate, already said, well, how about if
[25:23.700 --> 25:26.140]  every place put a little gift in there?
[25:26.140 --> 25:28.340]  Actually, I'll throw something in.
[25:28.340 --> 25:34.540]  And then at the end, the person that collected the most gets the little prize package from
[25:34.540 --> 25:36.660]  the 20 drop off spots.
[25:36.660 --> 25:40.900]  And Granny goes and spends a day with them doing something fun at their facility.
[25:40.900 --> 25:43.260]  We could turn this into a fun competition.
[25:43.260 --> 25:44.260]  This should be a lot of fun.
[25:44.260 --> 25:45.260]  Yeah.
[25:45.260 --> 25:46.780]  You could win a date with Granny.
[25:46.780 --> 25:51.980]  You know, and like I know some of the dispensaries are going to go penny pre-roll.
[25:51.980 --> 25:54.140]  You know, I know that there's already some specials.
[25:54.140 --> 25:55.140]  Right.
[25:55.140 --> 25:56.140]  I know.
[25:56.140 --> 25:57.780]  We'll go through the people we have.
[25:57.780 --> 26:00.180]  Like Lindsay said, there's only three spots left.
[26:00.180 --> 26:06.500]  So if you want to fill one of the last three spots, I guess-
[26:06.500 --> 26:07.900]  You got to be in Colorado Springs.
[26:07.900 --> 26:08.900]  Yes, you do.
[26:08.900 --> 26:13.180]  You need to have a place where you can collect canned foods, a high traffic area.
[26:13.180 --> 26:17.180]  You got to be able to participate with the cannabis community and be proud of the cannabis
[26:17.180 --> 26:18.180]  community.
[26:18.180 --> 26:21.860]  If you've got any fear or hatred for the cannabis community, please don't respond to this ad.
[26:21.860 --> 26:23.740]  No, no, no, no, not at all.
[26:23.740 --> 26:25.740]  And we're not going to junk up your facility.
[26:25.740 --> 26:30.140]  If you call and say the box is full, somebody will be there to pick it up and your lobby
[26:30.140 --> 26:33.020]  or wherever you have the box will not be an eyesore.
[26:33.020 --> 26:35.860]  I promise you that.
[26:35.860 --> 26:41.020]  And it's a win-win situation because you get free publicity on my social media.
[26:41.020 --> 26:44.100]  That's one of the things I was going to say, you have to be okay with Granny publicizing
[26:44.100 --> 26:47.540]  your area, your facility, your store, wherever it is.
[26:47.540 --> 26:52.620]  If it's a head shop, if it's a grow store, if it's a dispensary, if it's a glass shop,
[26:52.620 --> 26:56.580]  I think I said head shop, but I'm high as shit, so I might not have.
[26:56.580 --> 27:01.860]  Anywhere that cannabis consumers or counterculture folk millennials may roam.
[27:01.860 --> 27:02.860]  Coffee shop?
[27:02.860 --> 27:03.860]  Yeah.
[27:03.860 --> 27:04.860]  Yeah, okay.
[27:04.860 --> 27:06.900]  I'm down for anything as long as you're cannabis friendly.
[27:06.900 --> 27:09.940]  Well, I bet you by the time this comes out, you'll have your three slots filled because
[27:09.940 --> 27:12.820]  you are a, you're a networking young lady.
[27:12.820 --> 27:14.220]  That is what I seem to do.
[27:14.220 --> 27:15.220]  Yes.
[27:15.220 --> 27:16.580]  A higher elevation has got to be on your list.
[27:16.580 --> 27:17.580]  Of course.
[27:17.580 --> 27:18.580]  Let me run down the list.
[27:18.580 --> 27:19.660]  Let's hear the 17.
[27:19.660 --> 27:20.660]  Glass grinds.
[27:20.660 --> 27:24.540]  I know they're located down on the South end of town, right?
[27:24.540 --> 27:25.540]  Somewhere off Fillmore.
[27:25.540 --> 27:26.540]  Yeah, off Fillmore.
[27:26.540 --> 27:28.580]  Then of course, the traveling stoners.
[27:28.580 --> 27:31.980]  Place of business, green and healthy wellness.
[27:31.980 --> 27:35.340]  Canna Canyon, they're over on old Colorado.
[27:35.340 --> 27:36.340]  The weed pimps.
[27:36.340 --> 27:37.340]  They're fun guys.
[27:37.340 --> 27:38.340]  They really are.
[27:38.340 --> 27:41.980]  They make me laugh every time I see them.
[27:41.980 --> 27:42.980]  Elevate and hemp.
[27:42.980 --> 27:44.940]  There will be a box at both locations.
[27:44.940 --> 27:46.580]  Epic remedy.
[27:46.580 --> 27:49.020]  There's one down on the circle.
[27:49.020 --> 27:50.460]  They have one up on Academy.
[27:50.460 --> 27:52.580]  Both stores will have a box.
[27:52.580 --> 27:53.580]  Grow life.
[27:53.580 --> 27:54.580]  Uh, natural mystics.
[27:54.580 --> 27:55.580]  Caregivers.
[27:55.580 --> 27:56.580]  They're downtown.
[27:56.580 --> 27:57.580]  What's up, Joey?
[27:57.580 --> 27:58.580]  DBK glass.
[27:58.580 --> 27:59.580]  The family joint.
[27:59.580 --> 28:00.580]  The dinkery.
[28:00.580 --> 28:01.580]  They're a new dispensary.
[28:01.580 --> 28:07.020]  Can I tell you something funny about the dinkery?
[28:07.020 --> 28:08.020]  I think it's funny.
[28:08.020 --> 28:09.020]  Okay.
[28:09.020 --> 28:10.020]  Yes.
[28:10.020 --> 28:11.020]  As long as it's funny and not derogatory.
[28:11.020 --> 28:12.020]  It's not at all derogatory.
[28:12.020 --> 28:18.100]  You know, I once managed a nonprofit on a military installation in Colorado Springs and I was
[28:18.180 --> 28:20.860]  let go because of dabbing granny.
[28:20.860 --> 28:24.660]  Nobody there ever talks to me anymore because I smoke cannabis.
[28:24.660 --> 28:26.980]  You made new friends.
[28:26.980 --> 28:27.980]  I met one.
[28:27.980 --> 28:29.420]  Well, my life has gotten much better.
[28:29.420 --> 28:32.700]  I mean, I liked what I did, but box next.
[28:32.700 --> 28:37.020]  I ran into the dinkery just because it was a new dispensary and I was with one of my
[28:37.020 --> 28:38.020]  friends.
[28:38.020 --> 28:42.860]  They took a picture because they were very happy to see the dabbing granny.
[28:42.860 --> 28:48.900]  One of my former volunteers, because I was a volunteer organization, got in touch with
[28:48.900 --> 28:54.300]  me and said, Gail, Gail is my real name.
[28:54.300 --> 28:56.540]  You were at my son's dispensary today.
[28:56.540 --> 28:58.460]  That was just absolutely wonderful.
[28:58.460 --> 29:03.500]  And I said, in almost a year, you're the first person that has reached out to talk to me.
[29:03.500 --> 29:08.860]  And she said, she was very happy I was at the dinkery.
[29:08.860 --> 29:09.860]  Kind of funny.
[29:09.860 --> 29:11.540]  That sucks that people just shunned you.
[29:12.220 --> 29:14.020]  But look at the great friends I've made.
[29:14.020 --> 29:15.020]  That's true.
[29:15.020 --> 29:16.020]  You've replaced them.
[29:16.020 --> 29:17.020]  Oh, yes.
[29:17.020 --> 29:18.020]  Yeah.
[29:18.020 --> 29:19.020]  Way better company.
[29:19.020 --> 29:20.020]  I think so.
[29:20.020 --> 29:21.020]  Upgrade.
[29:21.020 --> 29:24.660]  Truthfully, people, somebody asked me in one of my comments today, they said, did you ever
[29:24.660 --> 29:29.660]  think at your age you would be this important person in the cannabis community?
[29:29.660 --> 29:32.140]  And I said, no, I pinch myself every morning.
[29:32.140 --> 29:34.020]  I'm like, how can this be?
[29:34.020 --> 29:36.180]  How can this be?
[29:36.180 --> 29:37.180]  I embrace it.
[29:37.180 --> 29:38.580]  No security clearance to get in here.
[29:38.580 --> 29:41.340]  It was easy.
[29:42.140 --> 29:43.140]  What did you do to Lindsay, dude?
[29:43.140 --> 29:44.140]  I didn't do anything.
[29:44.140 --> 29:45.140]  She got her own dab.
[29:45.140 --> 29:46.140]  She set herself up.
[29:46.140 --> 29:47.140]  She heat her own nail.
[29:47.140 --> 29:48.140]  I didn't do anything.
[29:48.140 --> 29:49.140]  Is she in there puking?
[29:49.140 --> 29:52.260]  I don't think she's puking, but I can hear her coughing through the walls.
[29:52.260 --> 29:56.300]  She went on a coughing fit and I don't think she tried to hold it for the mics to not die
[29:56.300 --> 29:57.300]  in this room.
[29:57.300 --> 29:58.740]  I talked about you earlier.
[29:58.740 --> 30:00.100]  Did your ears ring?
[30:00.100 --> 30:05.940]  Because Chris said, I watched you do that dab and you just kept going in and you didn't
[30:05.940 --> 30:06.940]  cough.
[30:06.940 --> 30:09.340]  It's so mesmerizing watching.
[30:09.340 --> 30:10.620]  You have Jeff to thank for that.
[30:10.620 --> 30:14.220]  I don't even know if you know this.
[30:14.220 --> 30:19.380]  You when I, I think it might've been the first time we met at the first podcast and we talked
[30:19.380 --> 30:24.900]  about coughing during doing, and you said, well, I very rarely cough because you own
[30:24.900 --> 30:25.900]  your lungs.
[30:25.900 --> 30:27.420]  You can tell them what to do.
[30:27.420 --> 30:31.460]  So when I feel that tickle and you all know what I mean when I say I feel that tickle,
[30:31.460 --> 30:37.700]  I hear that your voice in my head and I almost meditate with my eyes open that I'm not going
[30:37.700 --> 30:38.700]  to cough.
[30:38.700 --> 30:39.700]  Yup.
[30:39.780 --> 30:40.780]  All right.
[30:40.780 --> 30:42.580]  I've never talked about this on a podcast.
[30:42.580 --> 30:44.580]  I've only told like four people in my whole life.
[30:44.580 --> 30:45.740]  This granny was one of them.
[30:45.740 --> 30:46.740]  I take giant dabs.
[30:46.740 --> 30:50.340]  You guys, when you feel like you're going to cough, when you feel that thing that goes
[30:50.340 --> 30:54.340]  like you, you blow out the dab and you start to go, do you feel that shit?
[30:54.340 --> 30:56.900]  When you're, when you're walking at the mall, if you get a little cramp and you're like,
[30:56.900 --> 30:59.700]  you know, just fucking fall down and start to spit.
[30:59.700 --> 31:00.700]  I'm just some of you do.
[31:00.700 --> 31:02.660]  I'm sorry, but you've got a condition.
[31:02.660 --> 31:04.740]  Most people don't just fall down and fucking cannabis.
[31:04.740 --> 31:05.740]  Donald's.
[31:05.740 --> 31:10.540]  I was just a second, but most normal folk, if you get a cramp, you don't just fucking
[31:10.540 --> 31:12.540]  fall down and spaz out in the middle of the mall.
[31:12.540 --> 31:13.820]  In my opinion, that's what my lungs are doing.
[31:13.820 --> 31:14.820]  I'm coughing.
[31:14.820 --> 31:17.460]  They're throwing a fit like a fucking mad child to cramp.
[31:17.460 --> 31:22.100]  I feel that cough coming and I either inhale or exhale as hard as I can distract them.
[31:22.100 --> 31:25.260]  Like when your dog's trying to run away at a cat, you just pull the leash and put a treat
[31:25.260 --> 31:26.260]  in front of it.
[31:26.260 --> 31:27.260]  It forgets about the cat.
[31:27.260 --> 31:28.260]  It looks at the tree and goes, Oh, treat.
[31:28.260 --> 31:29.260]  I liked it.
[31:29.260 --> 31:30.260]  I just breathe in real hard.
[31:30.260 --> 31:31.260]  My lungs like air.
[31:31.260 --> 31:33.500]  So they just suck that in instead of trying to cough.
[31:33.500 --> 31:35.500]  I don't know if that's good for me or bad for me.
[31:36.260 --> 31:39.660]  But it's got to be better than coughing so hard and blowing out my face and getting red
[31:39.660 --> 31:41.180]  eyed and I've coughed so hard.
[31:41.180 --> 31:44.620]  I've blown up fucking blood vessel in my eye.
[31:44.620 --> 31:46.180]  I get abs when I do cough.
[31:46.180 --> 31:47.180]  You know what I mean?
[31:47.180 --> 31:49.060]  I feel like I do those little coughs.
[31:49.060 --> 31:54.380]  That's just a shit cough, but I don't let those death death coughs in people.
[31:54.380 --> 31:59.620]  Every now and again, I've smoked strange product and get wet lungs.
[31:59.620 --> 32:00.620]  PHO?
[32:00.620 --> 32:01.620]  Propane, lemon oil?
[32:01.620 --> 32:02.620]  I don't know.
[32:02.620 --> 32:03.620]  Is that what it is?
[32:03.620 --> 32:04.620]  Yeah, well, that's in my opinion when I smoke PHO.
[32:04.740 --> 32:07.660]  Yeah, I know that sounds weird to a lot of people in random places, but that you can
[32:07.660 --> 32:11.980]  make quality cannabis concentrates with propane if you do it properly.
[32:11.980 --> 32:14.020]  But it comes out like live resonant.
[32:14.020 --> 32:15.020]  It comes out really moist.
[32:15.020 --> 32:19.100]  When I smoke it, my lungs feel heavy and I spit up all cough up the next morning.
[32:19.100 --> 32:21.620]  I'll cough up a bright green or a bright yellow.
[32:21.620 --> 32:22.620]  Yes.
[32:22.620 --> 32:23.620]  Golf like you're sick.
[32:23.620 --> 32:24.620]  Oh my God.
[32:24.620 --> 32:25.620]  Do I need?
[32:25.620 --> 32:26.620]  But once it comes out, I'm marvelous.
[32:26.620 --> 32:29.100]  But it's wet in your lungs in the morning.
[32:29.100 --> 32:30.100]  Yeah.
[32:30.100 --> 32:31.100]  Yeah.
[32:31.100 --> 32:32.100]  Oh, we should finish our list.
[32:32.100 --> 32:33.100]  I was going to keep you on the list.
[32:33.100 --> 32:34.100]  I'm sorry.
[32:34.580 --> 32:35.580]  We like it when we ramble.
[32:35.580 --> 32:36.580]  We're back.
[32:36.580 --> 32:40.420]  Back to, as you always say, let's get back to the podcast.
[32:40.420 --> 32:41.420]  New Age Medical.
[32:41.420 --> 32:44.420]  I think they're out by Garden of the Gods.
[32:44.420 --> 32:45.620]  That's a cool name.
[32:45.620 --> 32:46.620]  That's Bailey.
[32:46.620 --> 32:48.620]  Big shout out to New Age Medical.
[32:48.620 --> 32:49.620]  Yes.
[32:49.620 --> 32:50.620]  Rocky Mountain Dabber.
[32:50.620 --> 32:51.620]  I love her.
[32:51.620 --> 32:52.620]  Tweedleaf.
[32:52.620 --> 32:57.140]  Tweedleaf is really, I'm glad they're on board because they actually once a month wanted
[32:57.140 --> 32:58.780]  to do a charity event.
[32:58.780 --> 33:00.860]  Nobody seemed to want cannabis money.
[33:00.860 --> 33:03.160]  Yeah, that's the hard part about it.
[33:03.220 --> 33:09.160]  We found, Grow for Vets finally took money, but it was really, really hard to find anybody
[33:09.160 --> 33:10.880]  that will take cannabis money.
[33:10.880 --> 33:15.280]  The vets always need help and it's always great to help the vets and they'll take it.
[33:15.280 --> 33:19.920]  So if you ever need some more to send stuff, I've got a guy who runs a veteran organization
[33:19.920 --> 33:22.040]  that will always need contributions.
[33:22.040 --> 33:28.360]  Well, she asked me again, can we do one Saturday a month where 10% of everybody's purchase
[33:28.360 --> 33:31.320]  goes directly to a charity?
[33:31.320 --> 33:33.240]  So shout out to Renee at Tweedleaf.
[33:33.240 --> 33:35.640]  So it's a pretty nice dispensary too.
[33:35.640 --> 33:36.640]  I'm sorry, Lindsay.
[33:36.640 --> 33:37.640]  Oh, what?
[33:37.640 --> 33:38.640]  I love you.
[33:38.640 --> 33:42.520]  Listen, I know it's not yours actually.
[33:42.520 --> 33:43.520]  It's not even that.
[33:43.520 --> 33:44.520]  I don't.
[33:44.520 --> 33:47.560]  But you do know one thing about me is that sense of loyalty I have.
[33:47.560 --> 33:48.560]  It's just ingrained in me.
[33:48.560 --> 33:50.360]  I go to other dispensaries.
[33:50.360 --> 33:51.360]  It happens.
[33:51.360 --> 33:56.880]  I do primarily shop at Green and Healthy, but I visit other dispensaries and I go into
[33:56.880 --> 33:57.880]  other places.
[33:57.880 --> 34:00.400]  They don't grow every strand in the world, right?
[34:00.480 --> 34:03.480]  They don't have the orange.
[34:03.480 --> 34:04.480]  Right.
[34:04.480 --> 34:06.000]  Like I like to go to other places.
[34:06.000 --> 34:07.000]  I like to-
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.000]  I just have to.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.120]  I cannot go to one dispensary because of the different drops and y'all know I've developed
[34:13.120 --> 34:15.000]  great taste buds for different product.
[34:15.000 --> 34:20.200]  I was complimenting you earlier on your ability to shop everywhere.
[34:20.200 --> 34:23.120]  That I can recognize concentrates by their containers.
[34:23.120 --> 34:24.880]  You kind of get around in a good way.
[34:24.880 --> 34:25.880]  Yeah.
[34:25.880 --> 34:26.880]  And I enjoy it.
[34:26.880 --> 34:30.440]  I enjoy being able to tell people, you know, this is really good product.
[34:30.440 --> 34:32.840]  Go spend your X amount of dollars.
[34:32.840 --> 34:36.320]  Every day in the late afternoon around 2.30, 3 o'clock, you can open up Instagram and see
[34:36.320 --> 34:37.840]  where granny decided to shop today.
[34:37.840 --> 34:40.280]  There's one or two shots of her and the cool bud tender there.
[34:40.280 --> 34:41.280]  They would treat her politely.
[34:41.280 --> 34:43.000]  There's always a shot of me on somebody's page.
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.000]  I love it.
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  I love it when you pop up somewhere random.
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  I'm like, oh, she's at, I can almost tell where you are.
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.480]  Like, oh, she went to Elevate and then she had lunch.
[34:48.480 --> 34:49.480]  I have this little-
[34:49.480 --> 34:51.480]  And then she took, yeah, she took Grumpy Grandpa somewhere.
[34:51.480 --> 34:52.480]  Yeah, I have a little pass.
[34:52.480 --> 34:53.480]  I go up.
[34:53.480 --> 34:54.480]  And then she went to the glass grind.
[34:54.480 --> 34:55.480]  That's funny.
[34:55.480 --> 34:56.480]  All right.
[34:57.080 --> 34:58.080]  All right.
[34:58.080 --> 34:59.080]  So you have Altitude Meds.
[34:59.080 --> 35:00.080]  They're downtown, I believe.
[35:00.080 --> 35:01.080]  Yes.
[35:01.080 --> 35:02.080]  There's several locations.
[35:02.080 --> 35:03.080]  Okay.
[35:03.080 --> 35:04.720]  Well, wherever they are, we're going to have boxes in all their locations.
[35:04.720 --> 35:11.920]  Emerald City Wellness, the Pink House, and Stained Glass LLC.
[35:11.920 --> 35:13.560]  So that leaves three spots.
[35:13.560 --> 35:19.400]  Get in touch with me, DM me on Instagram, dabbing underscore granny.
[35:19.400 --> 35:21.520]  I think those spots will fill up quickly though.
[35:21.520 --> 35:22.520]  Yeah.
[35:22.520 --> 35:23.520]  Not just this spot.
[35:23.520 --> 35:24.520]  Well, you'll probably have those filled.
[35:24.520 --> 35:28.900]  comes out in like seven or 10 days from now. So these seven, 10 is a probably be filled
[35:28.900 --> 35:33.740]  up hopefully with much faith. Uh, what we need now is people to go to these locations
[35:33.740 --> 35:37.580]  with a non-perishable canned good that you would eat. You guys that you would put in
[35:37.580 --> 35:42.140]  a pan and heat up yourself and sit down and enjoy like a meal by yourself. It don't bring
[35:42.140 --> 35:45.020]  us a bunch of random side shit. We want to feed some people.
[35:45.020 --> 35:48.140]  And you know what? Maybe you're not a big shopper. That's what that Mason jar is going
[35:48.140 --> 35:55.720]  to be for. And guess what? The cannabis community is the most honorable community. You can drop
[35:55.720 --> 36:00.960]  your money in a dispensary. You will get it back. You can leave your badge or your ID
[36:00.960 --> 36:05.640]  behind because we're all stoners. And if we drop some shit, we hope that you're going
[36:05.640 --> 36:10.720]  to hand it to me also. Maybe I've just been lucky, but I hear it's pretty, pretty often
[36:10.720 --> 36:15.760]  that people always get back their stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[36:15.760 --> 36:20.860]  With that said though, if you're broke and all you have in your cabinet is something
[36:20.860 --> 36:26.260]  in all you want to bring, you want to bring something in like we will say we will take
[36:26.260 --> 36:31.420]  that cream corn or those, don't feel like you can participate. Yes. Please don't feel
[36:31.420 --> 36:36.100]  like we're sitting here and saying, don't bring anything in. Like if you know, like
[36:36.100 --> 36:37.940]  believe me, I've been there. I was in college.
[36:37.940 --> 36:40.420]  Only steak and lobster. Nothing but steak and lobster.
[36:40.420 --> 36:43.940]  But don't bring that. But that, but not this.
[36:43.940 --> 36:48.720]  I was just sitting there thinking like, Oh God, three years ago I would have been like,
[36:48.720 --> 36:54.040]  well shit, I'm not bringing anything in. We're just trying to feed. But maybe, you know,
[36:54.040 --> 36:59.800]  you might've been one of the people that hopefully was benefiting from our little food drive.
[36:59.800 --> 37:06.320]  The college one. Most people unfortunately are right at that line where they don't need
[37:06.320 --> 37:09.520]  the help, but they can't afford to give any help. You know what I'm saying? That's like
[37:09.520 --> 37:14.580]  where most folks are right now. Making crucial decisions. Do I need this or do we want to
[37:14.580 --> 37:18.340]  eat at the end of the week? Do you want to wipe my ass or get high this week? It's kind
[37:18.340 --> 37:23.140]  of time to decide. I can walk to work, not get gas. Let's figure this out. What's up?
[37:23.140 --> 37:28.380]  What can we give up? Yeah. Oh, you just gave me a sinking feeling of recreation, of cannabis.
[37:28.380 --> 37:35.300]  Oh, pending doom. When you said Medicaid or wipe your butt. I'm afraid that's what Californians
[37:35.300 --> 37:39.000]  are facing. Yeah. I tried to stay out of a lot of the California stuff. I'm sorry you
[37:39.000 --> 37:45.240]  opened it up. Yeah. I see both sides of it and I try to stay. That's California. So Colorado,
[37:45.240 --> 37:50.680]  we did all the things right. We did it right here as usual. We thought that we had lost
[37:50.680 --> 37:54.920]  an initiative here in Pueblo and they are recounting and still counting. And it turns
[37:54.920 --> 37:59.860]  out that we may have actually won three of the four major cannabis initiatives. We may
[37:59.860 --> 38:03.640]  actually get to open recreational cannabis facilities within the city limits of Pueblo
[38:03.740 --> 38:08.060]  before too long here. And you want a new job? It'll be fun. We'll both go work in a new dispenser
[38:08.060 --> 38:13.100]  and be bud tenders. It'll be so much fun. Did white Mike have anything to do with this? Was
[38:13.100 --> 38:18.300]  he quite the activist for all the things that were going on? White Mike did a lot of groundwork
[38:18.300 --> 38:23.460]  and a lot of internet work and a lot of podcast work. So yeah, if you want to give Mike a shout
[38:23.460 --> 38:27.020]  out, he might appreciate it. I've only met him once, but yeah, shout out. Cause I listened to
[38:27.020 --> 38:33.260]  your podcast where I gained so much knowledge. I appreciate it. And I've listened to Mike and
[38:34.240 --> 38:39.920]  even though I met him one time in person where he was so quiet, he's not that way on the podcast.
[38:40.720 --> 38:45.360]  He's quiet until he gets a read on you and knows how much of him you want to hear. And then he'll
[38:45.360 --> 38:50.080]  give you enough. He's, he's polite. Like he was, yeah, he was taught to speak when spoken to and
[38:50.080 --> 38:54.480]  shut the fuck up when it's time to shut the fuck up. But he's very knowledgeable about cannabis.
[38:54.480 --> 38:58.800]  He's a smart dude. He is a smart dude. He's passionate about cannabis. So thank you white
[38:58.820 --> 39:05.220]  Mike. Yes. We're lucky to have such a good team. Like we've got growers and we've got activists
[39:05.220 --> 39:09.060]  and we've got city council representatives. We've got glass makers so that we can consume
[39:09.060 --> 39:12.740]  our products. We've got Lindsay over here promoting us and keeping us medicated.
[39:13.380 --> 39:18.260]  Whoa. I don't know what that meant, but that was a bubble fish face. Yeah, that was weird.
[39:20.740 --> 39:22.980]  Oh no. It might be time to start trolling Lindsay in a minute.
[39:24.100 --> 39:27.940]  I thought you were throwing up from your dab. Oh no, no. Just some coughs.
[39:29.060 --> 39:33.940]  I took it way too hot. That's what it was. It wasn't even that it was a big dab. I,
[39:33.940 --> 39:42.260]  and I felt like she got her own dab. She hit her own nail. Oh no. I, I don't even remember what I
[39:42.260 --> 39:46.260]  grabbed cause I had actually forgotten it was there. It was a big chunk of like two or three
[39:46.260 --> 39:51.460]  things. The dab was fine. It was after I sat here for a second, I was like, Ooh, that was really
[39:51.460 --> 39:56.340]  freaking hot. And I was like, that really hurt my chest. And I was like, Oh yeah, I'm going to cough
[39:56.360 --> 40:00.360]  for a while now. You can Mike it up in here and you can cough like Mike on the podcast for 10
[40:00.360 --> 40:05.080]  minutes. I just reach over and turn Mike's microphone down when he starts doing it. He
[40:05.080 --> 40:09.080]  gives me the, he points down and I'm like, I got you, bro. I'll turn that down for a minute.
[40:10.520 --> 40:16.040]  That's what friends are for. Yes. All right. So we've got a canned food drive toys. Also guys,
[40:16.040 --> 40:20.280]  toys are rad. Bring some toys, some Ninja turtles or some shit. Uh, something that you'd want to
[40:20.280 --> 40:24.600]  play with. I understand you don't got, don't all have a bunch of extra money. Uh, this will end.
[40:24.620 --> 40:28.540]  The drop off date will end December 10th. So you've got nearly a month from the time that this
[40:28.540 --> 40:32.460]  episode comes out pretty much December 16th, December. Oh, sorry. I just can't read my own
[40:32.460 --> 40:37.020]  damn writing. I'm sorry. That is the six. I will correct that. I cut my finger a couple of weeks
[40:37.020 --> 40:40.780]  ago. Remember I talked about it. We figured if we picked it up then, you know, that's a week before
[40:40.780 --> 40:45.740]  Christmas, get it to these folks over the weekend and they can distribute it that week of Christmas.
[40:45.740 --> 40:49.500]  Excellent. Yeah. Make some happy kids, make some bellies happy, make some folks happy,
[40:49.500 --> 40:53.980]  brighten up some holidays. Uh, whatever holiday you celebrate, share some, share some joy,
[40:54.000 --> 40:59.200]  help some people out. The winter gets cold and shitty here. Just the cold, the snow, the slowness,
[40:59.200 --> 41:05.200]  the, the, the fucking bet that vibe makes a lot of people depressed and sad anyway. And then you
[41:05.200 --> 41:08.800]  got a shitty Christmas on top of it. If you're not doing well, it really fucks things up. And if
[41:08.800 --> 41:13.680]  you got kids on top of that, that's just the icing on the damn poor cake. So it helps some people out,
[41:13.680 --> 41:17.680]  make them, make them have a little, little better kids. Don't know any different. Right? Yeah. Yeah.
[41:17.680 --> 41:22.560]  And if you, if you don't break them early, they get a chance. So let's try to help them out.
[41:23.140 --> 41:28.180]  I'm serious. I mean, yeah, you don't want to raise strippers and serial killers.
[41:29.620 --> 41:36.340]  Maybe you do. I don't know. So granny turned red and blushed. I have never seen granny's blush.
[41:41.620 --> 41:43.540]  I apologize or Andrew, you're welcome.
[41:46.740 --> 41:50.740]  I wrote down just a one word note and I'm pro I'm gonna wait till you get done taking that drink.
[41:50.760 --> 41:54.360]  Cause I don't want you to spread all over the table, but or all over me or all over Lindsay,
[41:54.360 --> 41:59.080]  cause she's looking right at you. I know. I was like, thank you. The new trend in cannabis that
[41:59.080 --> 42:04.600]  I have been catching on to, uh, does the suppositories, you know what? Okay. We're
[42:04.600 --> 42:10.360]  gonna let's, let's, let's be legitimate. I'm glad you brought that up. May I steal some of your green
[42:10.360 --> 42:17.560]  crack tabs to place on my turps? Thank you, man. Oh, this is going to do me just fine. Okay. This
[42:17.580 --> 42:24.780]  green crack turps on the, uh, what kind of shatter do I has this is black cherry Maduro.
[42:24.780 --> 42:31.820]  I like this drink. Nice. Okay. When I first heard about them, damn suppositories, even I was kind of
[42:31.820 --> 42:36.460]  skeptical, but I have a pretty sick husband. So I thought, okay, this is really going to help
[42:36.460 --> 42:42.460]  weaning them off the morphine and all that with this pain. Okay. What I have discovered is most,
[42:42.480 --> 42:48.720]  most of you men are homophobic. You met, you mentioned suppositories and I see you visibly
[42:48.720 --> 42:54.400]  squeezing your butt cheeks together. She's right. Am I? It's true. It's accurate. I don't know why
[42:56.160 --> 43:02.960]  women on the other hand, you know, we spit 10 pound babies out our vaginas. So what's a
[43:02.980 --> 43:11.380]  suppository? Lindsay's not me. We don't, we don't do that over here. Wow. Just like on command or
[43:11.380 --> 43:22.340]  anything. I took these home for my husband and I was like, look what I brought you there. 50% THC,
[43:22.340 --> 43:29.940]  50% C, um, CBDs. Thank you. I had a brain fart and he said, you stick that up your ass.
[43:30.920 --> 43:41.240]  And I was like, no problem. And I did. It is at least 12 hours of euphoria is the best way to put
[43:41.240 --> 43:48.280]  it. You can function, you can drive, you're not intoxicated, but you're euphoric. I used one the
[43:48.280 --> 43:53.960]  night we had our girls taken care of and it eased the pain. Okay. So my thought was, all right,
[43:53.980 --> 43:58.860]  now these things are really wonderful. If you are truly a medical patient, for real,
[44:00.300 --> 44:07.820]  if you're especially cancer patient, if you're vomiting, right? Skip that whole part of the body.
[44:07.820 --> 44:13.580]  Exactly. And you and I know that the divine creator did not make our lungs to ingest irritants. Some
[44:13.580 --> 44:19.020]  of us like to smoke. We know it's really not the best way to medicate. No ifs, ands, or buts. I
[44:19.040 --> 44:25.360]  like to smoke though. If you truly need to medicate, there are so many membranes in your anus.
[44:26.000 --> 44:31.360]  Using these suppositories is a wonderful way to medicate. Cannabis isn't the first medicine
[44:31.360 --> 44:36.240]  they've used as a suppository. No. This is just the newest and it's just on our realm. So now it's
[44:36.240 --> 44:40.640]  what we're talking about now. It's been used for, I'm going to say hundreds of years. I'm not certain,
[44:40.640 --> 44:44.400]  but I'm sure people have been boofing things for way longer than before cannabis came out. It is
[44:44.420 --> 44:50.260]  the best way to medicate. So the next week we'll skip. Okay. So I had no problem with it. I stuck
[44:50.260 --> 44:55.860]  one up my butt. I stuck a couple of them up my butt by now. My husband had to have a colonoscopy
[44:55.860 --> 44:59.940]  the next week and he came home. He's all grumpy after his colonoscopy. He was in pain. He was
[44:59.940 --> 45:04.020]  grouchy. And I was like, your butthole's already stretched out. Try one of them suppositories.
[45:04.020 --> 45:10.980]  Oh my God. I'm so glad he does not listen to this podcast. He tried one and he was like, you're
[45:11.000 --> 45:18.120]  right. My lower back pain is gone. I don't feel the nauseousness in my belly that I feel when I
[45:18.120 --> 45:24.360]  take a morphine for pain. Yeah. I'm swimming from that dab. I might've put a little too much
[45:24.360 --> 45:32.200]  terps, but I'm not complaining. That was not terps. That is pure green crack. That's like 96%
[45:32.200 --> 45:37.880]  THC. I just put a little line across the dab and it made my brain swim around in my head.
[45:38.780 --> 45:41.900]  I'll tell you. Should I tell the story about the green crack?
[45:41.900 --> 45:51.260]  Oh, yeah. Since we're on the pooping topic. Oh no. Okay. We're smoking on this stuff called green
[45:51.260 --> 45:55.820]  crack, which is a pretty sativa dominant strain. Wouldn't you all agree sitting around this?
[45:55.820 --> 46:00.540]  After the dab I just took, absolutely. Okay. And I'm not a real sativa person, but-
[46:00.540 --> 46:03.180]  You have to tell the- I'm getting there.
[46:03.920 --> 46:10.160]  Oh, okay. When you buy this distilled hash, it's solventless. It comes in a little syringe.
[46:10.160 --> 46:11.920]  It's not very big. It's glass.
[46:11.920 --> 46:17.680]  It's glass. It has a very small part where the medicine actually comes out of the syringe,
[46:17.680 --> 46:19.520]  like where a needle would be, I guess, in a syringe.
[46:19.520 --> 46:22.320]  There is no needle on it. The word syringe scares the shit out of people.
[46:22.320 --> 46:26.400]  Oh no. We don't want to- No, it's literally just a glass syringe. That's it.
[46:26.400 --> 46:32.080]  Maybe if you have children, you've used them for pulling up amoxicillin or an antibiotic to give
[46:32.100 --> 46:34.180]  to your baby, or if you have pets, you've used them-
[46:34.180 --> 46:37.300]  I was going to say it'd be good to feed a baby bird. It would be ideal.
[46:37.300 --> 46:37.940]  Oh yes.
[46:37.940 --> 46:40.500]  It's probably a really good description to put the idea in people's heads. It'd
[46:40.500 --> 46:41.780]  be perfect to feed a baby bird.
[46:41.780 --> 46:47.140]  Or if you had rodents or mice or something like that. Okay. So I really do like these
[46:47.140 --> 46:52.340]  suppositories for medicating. And I'm not going to say where, but a butt tender said,
[46:52.340 --> 47:00.340]  well, have you tried that hash? And I was like, no. He said, well, you should try that green crack.
[47:00.360 --> 47:04.360]  Anally asked. Okay. So I went home.
[47:08.680 --> 47:10.200]  I was bouncing off the wall.
[47:10.200 --> 47:11.640]  Wait, you put-
[47:11.640 --> 47:12.760]  She squirted an entire gram.
[47:12.760 --> 47:14.280]  The whole gram.
[47:14.280 --> 47:15.240]  Gram.
[47:15.240 --> 47:19.800]  So when I went back to that butt tender, I was like, my God, I was bouncing off the walls like
[47:19.800 --> 47:24.920]  I had consumed huge amounts of caffeine and lots of other things. And he said,
[47:25.640 --> 47:29.160]  granny, you didn't do the whole gram, did you? And I was like, well, yeah.
[47:29.820 --> 47:31.340]  800 and something milligrams.
[47:31.340 --> 47:35.420]  Yeah. Yeah. It's probably about somewhere between 800 and 900 milligrams.
[47:35.420 --> 47:36.540]  Yeah. It's exactly what I was going to say.
[47:36.540 --> 47:40.700]  Word from granny. Don't try that. That's like when I did all those edibles after the secret
[47:40.700 --> 47:40.940]  sesh.
[47:40.940 --> 47:43.900]  I'm pretty sure you don't have to discourage too many people sticking too much hash in their ass
[47:43.900 --> 47:49.260]  on this show. But if they were to try it, how much of-
[47:49.260 --> 47:51.180]  I really wouldn't suggest doing that.
[47:51.180 --> 47:51.580]  No?
[47:51.580 --> 47:52.060]  No.
[47:52.060 --> 47:52.300]  Okay.
[47:52.300 --> 47:55.020]  No. I don't think that product's made for that.
[47:55.020 --> 47:58.140]  The suppositories, however, would you do that again?
[47:58.160 --> 47:59.280]  I do them regularly.
[47:59.280 --> 47:59.520]  Okay.
[48:00.080 --> 48:03.440]  I've given some to the traveling stoner. We can ask her what her effect was.
[48:03.440 --> 48:05.840]  I watched her put her head down in blushes while I blinked.
[48:05.840 --> 48:08.480]  Because she can't be like, oh gosh, she's putting me on the spot.
[48:09.680 --> 48:11.680]  Come on, we're talking about true medication.
[48:11.680 --> 48:19.600]  The first time I ever did one, I actually did the Foria ones. So I had gotten the Foria ones as a
[48:19.600 --> 48:25.920]  sample so long ago and I never used them. And then once Gail started doing them, was talking about
[48:25.940 --> 48:32.660]  them, I was supposed to go to Denver and meet up with one of our friends for her birthday.
[48:33.460 --> 48:39.140]  And I was in a lot of pain that morning. And I was like, shit, I really need to go to Denver.
[48:40.260 --> 48:45.380]  We have plans and I really can't let this fuck up our plans for her birthday.
[48:46.180 --> 48:49.060]  So I said to Chris, I'm like, I don't know what to do. He's like,
[48:49.060 --> 48:51.620]  you need to put one of those suppositories in and just try it.
[48:52.120 --> 48:57.240]  The first time I ever took one, the Foria ones are a lot stronger. They're like the 50-50 ones.
[48:57.240 --> 49:02.840]  So the first time I ever took it, I was like Gumby. And I think because I was in a lot of pain,
[49:04.920 --> 49:11.640]  immediately was out of pain. I don't know, it was weird. But yeah, you can ask Chris,
[49:11.640 --> 49:14.600]  I was like, I couldn't really move my lower half and stuff.
[49:14.600 --> 49:17.320]  She's like, I don't even feel my lower half. I feel great.
[49:18.300 --> 49:23.260]  But it took care of all that female pain you were having. True medication.
[49:23.260 --> 49:24.700]  How long does it take to kick in?
[49:24.700 --> 49:25.820]  Oh, about 15, 20 minutes.
[49:25.820 --> 49:32.460]  Oh man. Granny gave me some drops, some oral sublingual drops today. And I felt those within
[49:32.460 --> 49:33.740]  like 10 minutes.
[49:33.740 --> 49:37.100]  And they're pretty good for a tincture because a lot of tinctures are very
[49:37.100 --> 49:38.300]  ashy medicine.
[49:38.300 --> 49:45.020]  It was a very clean, almost like a green tea, but very light diluted green tea flavor. I actually
[49:45.040 --> 49:51.760]  enjoyed it. And then Lindsay was kind enough to throw me some of a pumpkin spice bar.
[49:51.760 --> 49:56.560]  Yeah, of course. Pumpkin spice, the white girl Incredibles edible. It was delicious
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.000]  and they're kicking, it's all working. It's all working now.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.040]  And it is all working.
[50:01.040 --> 50:05.120]  I'm so proud of you that you jumped back on the edible bag with bandwagon.
[50:05.120 --> 50:08.880]  I just needed to clean out. I had to kind of flush the edible system.
[50:08.900 --> 50:15.380]  I went through that. They tallied. I ate 5,200 milligrams of edibles the Sunday after the
[50:15.380 --> 50:19.140]  secret session we were at. It was Max's bacon.
[50:19.140 --> 50:20.660]  Oh yeah. Shout out to Max.
[50:20.660 --> 50:21.860]  Shout out to Max.
[50:21.860 --> 50:22.500]  And his grill.
[50:22.500 --> 50:24.020]  10 pieces Granny ate.
[50:25.780 --> 50:26.500]  Damn, Granny.
[50:26.500 --> 50:27.460]  But I didn't stop there.
[50:28.180 --> 50:29.300]  You just kept going?
[50:29.300 --> 50:34.500]  I ate two cookies that were about 500 milligrams each, those lemon ones.
[50:34.500 --> 50:35.060]  Oh man.
[50:35.060 --> 50:36.340]  But then I didn't stop there.
[50:37.320 --> 50:40.600]  I ate two cupcakes at the Traveling Star.
[50:40.600 --> 50:43.240]  I don't know. What were those? 150?
[50:43.240 --> 50:45.480]  What were the cupcakes? I don't even remember those.
[50:45.480 --> 50:47.240]  The strawberry pink cupcakes?
[50:47.240 --> 50:48.440]  You got those fancy?
[50:48.440 --> 50:50.440]  That was a different sesh.
[50:50.440 --> 50:51.480]  But I was hoping that we got the same thing.
[50:51.480 --> 50:53.880]  Oh my God, stop Jeff because those were amazing.
[50:53.880 --> 50:54.760]  Those were heavenly.
[50:54.760 --> 51:00.120]  Those ones you had gotten, we got the half dozen of the solventless pretty fancy.
[51:00.120 --> 51:01.560]  Oh, the donuts.
[51:01.560 --> 51:03.000]  Oh, what did I say?
[51:03.000 --> 51:03.720]  Cupcakes.
[51:03.720 --> 51:04.360]  Oh.
[51:04.460 --> 51:06.220]  Because that's immediately what I thought of.
[51:06.220 --> 51:07.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:07.020 --> 51:12.060]  Okay, so at the second secret sesh ever in Colorado, it was in May.
[51:12.780 --> 51:15.500]  You were in Florida. You weren't here for it.
[51:15.500 --> 51:18.940]  It was, you had literally flown out the day before.
[51:18.940 --> 51:20.940]  But he's looking like I know the cupcakes.
[51:20.940 --> 51:22.060]  Yeah, he saw pictures.
[51:22.780 --> 51:23.900]  No, he looks like he ate them.
[51:23.900 --> 51:24.780]  No, the donuts.
[51:24.780 --> 51:26.220]  Yeah, he knows the donuts.
[51:26.220 --> 51:29.500]  But yeah, those strawberry lemonade cupcakes.
[51:29.500 --> 51:30.380]  Oh, those were special.
[51:30.380 --> 51:31.660]  From secret sesh.
[51:31.680 --> 51:35.040]  And it was so funny because Jeff and I both, when I walked in, I was like,
[51:35.040 --> 51:37.760]  we both looked at each other and we're like, we're not going to eat edibles.
[51:37.760 --> 51:39.200]  First of all, I found Jeff in the corner.
[51:39.200 --> 51:40.880]  Oh, that's the best.
[51:40.880 --> 51:42.960]  Had he already consumed edibles?
[51:42.960 --> 51:43.840]  No, not yet.
[51:43.840 --> 51:49.200]  Adam Mill brought me on stage and gave me a two gram dab and then asked-
[51:49.200 --> 51:50.640]  Did he do one with you?
[51:50.640 --> 51:52.800]  No, we kind of fixed it.
[51:52.800 --> 51:57.360]  See, he knows that I like to take big dabs and we're buddies and he was on stage and he goes,
[51:57.360 --> 51:59.040]  I'm higher than you because that's his thing.
[51:59.040 --> 52:00.320]  He likes to say, I'm higher than you.
[52:00.660 --> 52:01.540]  I'm higher than you.
[52:01.540 --> 52:02.260]  Why?
[52:02.260 --> 52:03.700]  That's my Adam Mill impersonation.
[52:03.700 --> 52:05.140]  And then he grabs his shirt like he's cool.
[52:05.140 --> 52:06.100]  Why?
[52:06.100 --> 52:08.500]  And I pointed at him, I go, no, you're not because I'm taller than him.
[52:08.500 --> 52:09.220]  So I'm always higher.
[52:09.220 --> 52:10.260]  You're much taller than him.
[52:10.260 --> 52:12.020]  Yeah, so I'm always higher.
[52:12.020 --> 52:13.540]  I think even I was taller than I am.
[52:13.540 --> 52:14.180]  Yes, you are.
[52:14.180 --> 52:16.260]  I've got a really killer picture of the two of you on my phone.
[52:16.260 --> 52:16.900]  I'll show you later.
[52:16.900 --> 52:17.540]  Oh, okay.
[52:17.540 --> 52:19.460]  You guys were talking and you didn't know I was taking pictures.
[52:19.460 --> 52:20.820]  I just thought there's two of my favorite people.
[52:20.820 --> 52:22.100]  I just took a picture of you guys.
[52:22.100 --> 52:24.580]  So Adam calls me out.
[52:24.580 --> 52:26.820]  He's like, Jeff, I'm higher than you.
[52:26.820 --> 52:27.940]  Come up on stage.
[52:27.960 --> 52:29.720]  And so fucking, yes, my Adam Mill impersonation.
[52:29.720 --> 52:30.760]  I think it's really fun, right?
[52:30.760 --> 52:31.320]  Yeah, it's really good.
[52:31.320 --> 52:31.800]  It's easy to do.
[52:31.800 --> 52:32.600]  You just plug your nose.
[52:32.600 --> 52:34.360]  You just plug your nose.
[52:34.360 --> 52:36.920]  And so he comes up and he's like, you think you can take a big dab?
[52:36.920 --> 52:37.880]  And I was like, I can do a big dab.
[52:37.880 --> 52:38.840]  And he's like, you ready for this?
[52:38.840 --> 52:40.040]  And stretches out two grams.
[52:40.040 --> 52:41.000]  And I was like, ah, shit.
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.440]  I didn't know that's what was coming.
[52:42.440 --> 52:44.440]  And he heated the nail to where it was white.
[52:44.440 --> 52:45.080]  It wasn't red.
[52:45.080 --> 52:46.120]  It was white.
[52:46.120 --> 52:47.080]  And I was like, let it cool.
[52:47.080 --> 52:48.040]  And he goes, nope, just hit it.
[52:48.040 --> 52:49.720]  And I was like, no, let it cool.
[52:49.720 --> 52:52.120]  And so I hesitated as long as I could.
[52:52.140 --> 52:54.300]  But then I just went in because he was pushing it on there.
[52:54.860 --> 52:55.820]  And I pulled the whole thing.
[52:55.820 --> 52:56.540]  And then I blew it out.
[52:56.540 --> 52:57.980]  And he's like, damn, this guy's a champ.
[52:57.980 --> 53:00.140]  And everyone's like, can you do a bigger dab than him?
[53:00.140 --> 53:01.260]  And people like, yes.
[53:01.260 --> 53:04.140]  They would come up on stage and we would dab together.
[53:04.140 --> 53:05.020]  You kept dabbing?
[53:05.020 --> 53:05.900]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[53:05.900 --> 53:07.420]  They couldn't finish their dabs.
[53:07.420 --> 53:10.060]  And I would grab the rig from them after I took mine.
[53:10.060 --> 53:12.620]  And then I would finish their dab for them and set the rig down.
[53:12.620 --> 53:13.420]  Like, now what's up?
[53:13.980 --> 53:17.420]  But honestly, that only lasted for one set, he calls it.
[53:17.420 --> 53:20.860]  Adam does like little 45 minute things and then goes and takes a break.
[53:20.860 --> 53:21.900]  Walks around the crowd.
[53:22.220 --> 53:24.380]  One of those and I had to go sit upstairs and eat.
[53:24.380 --> 53:26.300]  There wasn't real food there at the time.
[53:26.300 --> 53:30.060]  So I ate about 12 bags of chips and like seven bottles of water.
[53:30.620 --> 53:32.060]  Like I was high.
[53:33.340 --> 53:34.700]  I imagine so.
[53:34.700 --> 53:36.620]  I was really high.
[53:36.620 --> 53:41.180]  That's why I didn't want to do a gram dab in that relay thing we were in.
[53:41.180 --> 53:42.540]  But I wanted to win.
[53:42.540 --> 53:44.940]  So Max heated up my nail and he's like, let it cool.
[53:44.940 --> 53:46.540]  I was like, no, no, I want to win.
[53:46.540 --> 53:47.340]  I'm going to hit it hard.
[53:47.340 --> 53:48.220]  I'm going to hit it hard.
[53:49.020 --> 53:49.820]  Ouch.
[53:49.820 --> 53:50.220]  Yeah.
[53:50.240 --> 53:50.800]  Hot dabs.
[53:50.800 --> 53:52.160]  I go a little hotter than a lot of people.
[53:52.160 --> 53:53.200]  Hot dabs aren't too bad.
[53:53.200 --> 53:54.080]  I'm going to actually move the nail.
[53:54.080 --> 53:56.000]  He's not lying because I sat down.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  I'm sitting right in front of the email.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.520]  It's at the other end of the table.
[53:59.520 --> 54:02.720]  And I was like, is that email that hot?
[54:04.720 --> 54:05.200]  Yes, it is.
[54:05.200 --> 54:07.360]  But every everybody's email is different.
[54:07.360 --> 54:07.600]  Yeah.
[54:07.600 --> 54:11.120]  And I don't it's really not as high.
[54:11.120 --> 54:11.840]  Like I can keep my hands.
[54:11.840 --> 54:14.560]  And guys, when you do big dabs like Jeff and I do.
[54:15.840 --> 54:16.480]  The traveling.
[54:16.480 --> 54:18.720]  Yeah, you definitely watch the email struggle when Jeff is a dab.
[54:18.740 --> 54:23.380]  Yes, because you start you start dropping it and you see the temperature dropping right with your.
[54:23.380 --> 54:24.340]  It tries to keep up.
[54:24.340 --> 54:24.740]  Yeah.
[54:24.740 --> 54:25.060]  Yep.
[54:25.060 --> 54:29.860]  And I'll I hear some of the time I can hear my dab hardening up on the nail because it's like.
[54:30.420 --> 54:30.820]  Yep.
[54:30.820 --> 54:31.860]  It's like I can't keep up.
[54:31.860 --> 54:35.540]  You got to either suck harder or slower or turn this thing up.
[54:36.260 --> 54:36.980]  Stop, Lindsay.
[54:38.980 --> 54:39.540]  Bad monkey.
[54:42.180 --> 54:42.740]  Anyways.
[54:42.740 --> 54:44.580]  I see the wheels in your sky turning.
[54:44.580 --> 54:45.060]  Well.
[54:45.240 --> 54:49.720]  It went from suppositories to this really quickly.
[54:49.720 --> 54:52.280]  I don't know how that escalated that way, but I'm really glad that it did.
[54:52.280 --> 54:54.360]  Did you finish your story about suppositories?
[54:54.920 --> 54:56.520]  You really got Gumby.
[54:56.520 --> 54:57.880]  Yeah, I got all kinds of gummy.
[54:57.880 --> 54:59.400]  And it solved her woman problems.
[54:59.400 --> 55:00.200]  She had a much better day.
[55:00.200 --> 55:02.200]  Now you've figured out a better dosage, haven't you?
[55:02.200 --> 55:03.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[55:03.640 --> 55:08.360]  Because I mean, we've got the smaller ones now and stuff like that.
[55:08.360 --> 55:08.920]  Not for me.
[55:08.920 --> 55:10.040]  I need the big ones.
[55:10.040 --> 55:11.080]  I'm going to 100.
[55:11.080 --> 55:11.640]  100.
[55:11.640 --> 55:12.440]  I know you are.
[55:12.460 --> 55:17.260]  Doing 100 milligrams of THC and 100 milligrams of CBD in a suppository.
[55:18.460 --> 55:26.460]  100 milligrams of THC is enough for most people to orally consume and be just fine.
[55:27.020 --> 55:28.940]  I don't get like, oh, I'm high.
[55:28.940 --> 55:31.100]  But I'm like, oh, I'm high off of 100 milligrams.
[55:31.100 --> 55:35.820]  If I eat 100 milligrams and then take dabs like normal, then I'm like, oh, I'm high now.
[55:35.820 --> 55:37.980]  Like right now I'm high because I eat edibles also.
[55:37.980 --> 55:38.620]  Yes.
[55:38.620 --> 55:40.620]  But if just that amount of edibles wouldn't have done it.
[55:40.640 --> 55:44.000]  The two like kind of it's like a turbo makes your high turbo.
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.360]  It just gives you a little boost.
[55:45.360 --> 55:46.720]  Is that a little jump?
[55:46.720 --> 55:50.640]  I know I'm not like a scientist, but I pay attention to the body and I know that kind
[55:50.640 --> 55:50.960]  of stuff.
[55:50.960 --> 55:52.320]  I care about physical stuff.
[55:52.880 --> 55:57.040]  I know how quickly your bum is going to absorb that much medicine and you're going to absorb
[55:58.000 --> 55:58.480]  all of it.
[55:58.480 --> 55:59.760]  You're not going to poop any of it out.
[55:59.760 --> 56:01.840]  Your stomach's not going to destroy any of it.
[56:01.840 --> 56:03.520]  Your liver and kidneys aren't going to ruin it.
[56:04.320 --> 56:06.240]  It's just going to suck all up into you.
[56:06.240 --> 56:09.520]  Now, when I do try that high of a dosage, that will be, you know.
[56:10.640 --> 56:12.400]  For me, that's going to be even high for me.
[56:12.400 --> 56:13.680]  I'm not going anywhere.
[56:13.680 --> 56:14.640]  I'm going to test it out.
[56:15.280 --> 56:19.600]  We Facebook live it after after you've got it inserted and hands washed.
[56:19.600 --> 56:19.920]  Sure.
[56:19.920 --> 56:24.240]  I'll even put on my new outfit that the lady from Louis 420 bought me as a gift.
[56:24.240 --> 56:26.480]  You have so many cool friends to give you so many cool gifts.
[56:26.480 --> 56:27.520]  Okay, now you sit here.
[56:27.520 --> 56:28.320]  You know me.
[56:28.320 --> 56:29.840]  Am I very girly girly?
[56:29.840 --> 56:32.240]  Well, no, it was a very nice gift, but it's not.
[56:32.240 --> 56:34.880]  Did you call yourself on the last podcast an Iowa corn whore?
[56:34.880 --> 56:35.520]  Yes.
[56:35.520 --> 56:36.240]  Guess what she gave me.
[56:36.240 --> 56:37.040]  That's what she called herself.
[56:37.040 --> 56:38.240]  I am an Iowa corn whore.
[56:38.240 --> 56:38.800]  I know she did.
[56:38.800 --> 56:39.760]  But you know what she gave me?
[56:39.780 --> 56:40.260]  What?
[56:41.220 --> 56:43.220]  A gift bag from Victoria's Secret.
[56:43.940 --> 56:44.820]  Well, it goes with the new.
[56:44.820 --> 56:46.180]  But it wasn't so bad.
[56:46.180 --> 56:49.140]  I looked at it and I was like, really?
[56:49.140 --> 56:50.180]  It's yoga pants.
[56:51.540 --> 56:52.580]  That's not too bad.
[56:52.580 --> 56:56.180]  No, and a thing that says US Army and gold sequence.
[56:59.460 --> 57:00.100]  It's okay.
[57:00.100 --> 57:00.820]  Trying to pull you back.
[57:00.820 --> 57:03.460]  But it's just the Victoria's Secret.
[57:03.460 --> 57:05.540]  It was like, what is that?
[57:05.540 --> 57:06.100]  Yeah, that's.
[57:07.140 --> 57:08.340]  And you're a jeans and t-shirt kind of lady.
[57:08.360 --> 57:12.680]  When I told Tater that he is, I said, I've never been in a Victoria's Secret.
[57:12.680 --> 57:13.800]  And you know what he said?
[57:13.800 --> 57:16.440]  Unfortunately, I've been in many, many of them.
[57:17.240 --> 57:18.440]  Can you say that to Jeff?
[57:18.440 --> 57:19.160]  No, I've been there.
[57:19.160 --> 57:19.960]  I've totally been.
[57:19.960 --> 57:21.080]  How about you, Chris?
[57:21.080 --> 57:21.560]  No.
[57:21.560 --> 57:21.800]  No.
[57:22.840 --> 57:25.320]  Well, this is my thought on Victoria's Secrets.
[57:25.320 --> 57:28.920]  Truthfully, I think they're very expensive.
[57:28.920 --> 57:29.960]  It is expensive.
[57:29.960 --> 57:31.640]  And naked always worked for me.
[57:31.640 --> 57:34.120]  So why do you need these fancy thongs and shit?
[57:34.120 --> 57:35.880]  Yeah, I'm just going to pull that shit off anyway.
[57:35.880 --> 57:36.280]  Really?
[57:36.280 --> 57:37.160]  Honest to God.
[57:38.060 --> 57:40.860]  Unless you're strutting around in your heels of baby.
[57:41.740 --> 57:43.420]  You just don't need that shit.
[57:43.420 --> 57:44.860]  I'd rather buy medicine.
[57:44.860 --> 57:49.900]  Because I wish you could have seen the animation that went along with the voice.
[57:49.900 --> 57:51.340]  I dropped my pen and shit.
[57:51.340 --> 57:52.220]  Everything went wrong.
[57:52.220 --> 57:52.780]  That was great.
[57:54.140 --> 57:55.100]  Relax over there, Jeff.
[57:55.100 --> 57:57.260]  So Granny gets tons of great gifts is something I mentioned.
[57:57.260 --> 58:00.220]  But she's a karmic gift person.
[58:00.860 --> 58:01.420]  She brought me.
[58:01.980 --> 58:05.020]  I've got a Frisbee that is full of other gifts.
[58:05.600 --> 58:07.440]  Like, yeah, so she's a good car.
[58:07.440 --> 58:08.320]  She doesn't just get gifts.
[58:08.320 --> 58:08.880]  Got you guys.
[58:08.880 --> 58:10.000]  She does give them back.
[58:10.000 --> 58:11.920]  Yes, she's always, always.
[58:11.920 --> 58:13.520]  She's always got a basket full of candy.
[58:13.520 --> 58:15.840]  So if you take dabs and you're sitting there looking like you're depleted,
[58:15.840 --> 58:17.120]  she's like, you want some milk duds?
[58:17.920 --> 58:18.800]  What did I bring you?
[58:18.800 --> 58:20.480]  Milk chocolate suckers tonight?
[58:20.480 --> 58:21.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:21.200 --> 58:23.200]  To drop into the hot chocolate.
[58:23.200 --> 58:24.080]  That's going to be awesome.
[58:24.880 --> 58:25.280]  I'm in.
[58:25.840 --> 58:27.120]  All right, guys, let's recap.
[58:27.120 --> 58:28.480]  It seems like everybody's high.
[58:28.480 --> 58:29.680]  We've been going for almost an hour.
[58:29.680 --> 58:30.640]  Let's do a quick recap.
[58:31.520 --> 58:32.960]  A year on social media.
[58:32.960 --> 58:33.360]  Damn.
[58:33.360 --> 58:34.160]  Congratulations.
[58:34.180 --> 58:38.020]  Thanks to everybody out there that seems to like my silliness and quirkiness.
[58:38.020 --> 58:42.260]  I'll tell you, I'm always on the lookout for fun hats and stuff.
[58:43.300 --> 58:46.740]  What I have found for Christmas, you all are gonna love.
[58:48.100 --> 58:50.900]  So follow her on social media so that you can see it, you guys.
[58:51.620 --> 58:54.740]  Periscope and Facebook Live because she does a lot of stuff there.
[58:54.740 --> 58:55.780]  She smokes down.
[58:56.420 --> 58:59.220]  There's a new app that I've been on, Tokwit.
[58:59.220 --> 59:03.380]  And this is kind of fun because it's just people in the cannabis community.
[59:03.400 --> 59:08.360]  And what the end goal of this app is they want to be able to have multi-cam users.
[59:08.360 --> 59:11.160]  So it wouldn't just be you sitting there watching me smoke.
[59:11.160 --> 59:11.800]  Okay.
[59:11.800 --> 59:13.240]  All of us would be interacting.
[59:13.240 --> 59:14.680]  Kind of like a tiny chat sort of thing.
[59:14.680 --> 59:14.760]  Yeah.
[59:14.760 --> 59:15.560]  That sounds great.
[59:15.560 --> 59:16.520]  I would love to do that.
[59:16.520 --> 59:18.280]  So I'm kind of helping them promote this app.
[59:18.280 --> 59:22.520]  I think I saw Tokwit and I actually assumed that it was a pothead dating service.
[59:22.520 --> 59:25.640]  No, it's just like Periscope.
[59:25.640 --> 59:26.680]  I thought it was like...
[59:26.680 --> 59:27.320]  Only it's...
[59:27.320 --> 59:27.880]  No.
[59:27.880 --> 59:28.920]  That was the green Tinder.
[59:29.820 --> 59:32.060]  The green Tinder.
[59:32.060 --> 59:33.340]  It's not getting high with...
[59:34.780 --> 59:35.340]  Is it?
[59:35.340 --> 59:36.220]  Oh, no.
[59:36.220 --> 59:37.260]  Is there really one of those?
[59:37.260 --> 59:37.660]  There really is.
[59:37.660 --> 59:38.140]  It's something.
[59:38.140 --> 59:38.780]  Hold on.
[59:38.780 --> 59:40.540]  Like Grindr or Tinder?
[59:40.540 --> 59:41.980]  No, Grindr is for gay dudes.
[59:41.980 --> 59:42.380]  Oh, no.
[59:42.380 --> 59:42.940]  Then we don't...
[59:42.940 --> 59:45.420]  Well, if you need Grindr, that's okay.
[59:45.420 --> 59:46.700]  I'm not going to discriminate.
[59:46.700 --> 59:48.860]  Pass me my phone because I got it in there.
[59:48.860 --> 59:49.660]  Fuck you, Jim.
[59:49.660 --> 59:51.660]  Give me my phone and I'll tell you what it is, you dick.
[59:51.660 --> 59:52.540]  What are you looking for?
[59:53.820 --> 59:55.580]  The cannabis dating service?
[59:55.580 --> 59:56.220]  Yeah.
[59:56.220 --> 59:57.180]  I was like...
[59:57.180 --> 59:58.140]  I just mouthed him like,
[59:58.160 --> 59:59.120]  yo, hand me my phone.
[59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.760]  He's like, oh, Jeff's like, oh, Lindsay just wants me to hand...
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.400]  Hi there.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:02.880]  Yeah.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.360]  Thank you.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:03.840]  Hi there.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:04.640]  Hi there.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.040]  All right.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.120]  So, yeah, we're going to give them a free ad.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:07.600]  Hi there.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.880]  That's basically a hookup app for potheads.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.240]  You guys go check that one out.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.160]  You will not find me on that shit.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.600]  I am done as fuck with all that dating app shit.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.680]  Trust the fuck out of me.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.200]  Three strikes, you're out, motherfucker.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.720]  Done did me wrong three times.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.780]  Brought me three men.
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.300]  Change of subject before I put this pen in my eye.
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:34.900]  In later news.
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:36.500]  Check out Toko.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.900]  By the way, that is a stylus as well as a pen.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.260]  I was noticing the little tip there.
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:40.660]  So be squishy.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.980]  Make sure you click it before you put it in there.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.980]  You'd be really disappointed.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.340]  That's why little...
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:47.540]  Just bounce off.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.420]  Sweet tips.
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:49.060]  Oh, come on.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.940]  Safety tip for my protection.
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:54.020]  Suicide-free pens.
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.260]  I have to shout them guys out because they make me laugh.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.200]  That is the Pot Brothers at Law.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.320]  They're out in California.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.360]  It's Mark and Craig.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.200]  I think their last name is Wasserman.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.520]  Pot Brothers at Law fighting for the cannabis community.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.720]  Wasserman and Wasserman.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.720]  855-WASSLAW.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:13.480]  They have a 25-word script, which I will give you their business card to put in your wallet
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.080]  that there's the 25-word script.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.720]  And it's basically the cop says, where you been?
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.160]  I don't have to discuss where I've been.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.000]  I don't have to tell you where I'm going.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:21.720]  I don't have to...
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.480]  And at the end, their hashtag is shut the fuck up.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.900]  When you're done, you shut the fuck up.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:31.500]  So they've sent me their hashtag hat and I wear it and I love it.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:32.300]  And people know what...
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.380]  Oh, I've seen your hashtag STFU hat.
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.100]  I love it.
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.380]  That's shut the fuck up from my friends, the Pot Brothers at Law.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:41.180]  Also, they could be Wasslaw if you want to call them.
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.020]  855-WASSLAW.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.260]  But I think Wasslaw is more appropriate.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:45.900]  But check them out.
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:46.700]  Pot Brothers at Law.
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:47.260]  Shout out.
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.700]  They do have funny social media.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.340]  Give them a follow.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:51.340]  There was somebody else that we were saying that we needed to...
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:52.380]  Was it August House?
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:53.180]  Was it my email?
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:53.660]  The email.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:53.900]  Yes.
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:54.540]  We've got to give them a shout out.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.280]  And actually, they're going to be working with the family joint.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.920]  He is from, I believe, Pennsylvania.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.760]  Everything is made here in the United States.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.840]  A really nice email.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.480]  I'm not a big email fan, but it's got LED lights.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.360]  Really, really nice quartz banger that's wrapped from the bottom up.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.240]  Consistent.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.480]  Keeps your nail consistently hot.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.680]  You told me it was programmable by your phone.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.120]  Yes, you have to have a smartphone.
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.780]  It's called the Cube One, and there's only a few.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.500]  You have to order them.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.060]  Okay.
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:29.860]  Okay.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:30.660]  And they're not cheap.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.220]  This I know.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.060]  But you can use my name as a promo.
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:33.860]  There you go.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.380]  I just remembered that.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.580]  But you get what you pay for.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:40.100]  Just like if you were buying Bobo Blaster's anything.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.340]  Bobo Blaster makes great emails.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:42.580]  Email.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.700]  I got one sitting over there.
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.100]  That's right.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.860]  It needs to be a little cleaned off and used.
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.060]  But you know yourself.
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:51.700]  If you're making American products, you're going to get what you pay for.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:52.500]  Yes, exactly.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.960]  And August House is a marriage.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:54.200]  He's.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.680]  Have you ever heard of him?
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.240]  I have not.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.360]  That's what I was happy that you finally got it because you showed me them a while back.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.400]  And it's pretty small.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.080]  I should have actually brought it with me.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.640]  It comes in a little box where you can take it along with you.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.400]  A little black pouch.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.000]  The nail looked really cool.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.080]  Yeah, it looked pretty sweet.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:14.920]  Like I say, I don't like emails, but y'all have been seeing me and I like that.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.600]  I can put my clear rates on top of that and make it look great.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.040]  I was got the lights on the top.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:20.680]  That's fresh.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:20.920]  Yeah.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:21.980]  You said it on top of that.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.340]  And it's got that circle just where your rig is going to stop.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.700]  You're shopping at Spencer's again.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.820]  I'm always going to be an old hippie at heart.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.340]  Or a young hippie.
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:32.620]  A hot topic.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.820]  That's a fun story.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.340]  We shop in the same places, Granny.
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.300]  I think we do.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:37.180]  Jeans and a T-shirt.
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:37.420]  Yep.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:38.780]  Sneakers.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:40.380]  I'm skate shoes for life.
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.180]  What do you prefer for hiking shoes?
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.780]  And I was like, DC's, Etnies.
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:45.260]  I don't know.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:45.900]  Something similar.
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:47.500]  Skateboard shoes.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.380]  As long as they fit.
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:48.700]  Yeah.
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.820]  Snug them up real good.
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:50.060]  Yeah.
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.180]  All right.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.060]  We've been going for an hour.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.500]  Most people want to check out by now.
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.140]  Okay, guys.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.980]  Let's give out all of our social media stuff.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.020]  Of course, everybody knows how to find the Davin Granny on all the social media.
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.580]  At Davin underscore Granny on Instagram.
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:01.980]  There is...
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.900]  I think if you Google me, you're going to find me.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.220]  Yeah.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.180]  Google here, you guys.
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.060]  Watch the videos.
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:08.700]  Watch the stuff with all the Russian comments from other people and shit.
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.460]  See what the other people from other countries say.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:13.020]  The comments are my favorite part sometimes.
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:13.500]  People say great shit.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.780]  Sometimes they're disgusting.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.540]  Well, you've got to...
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.460]  If you're on the internet, expect that dumb shit.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.980]  That's what I have come to learn.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.400]  Somebody thought Sam and I were a couple.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.560]  THC Sam.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.240]  They said, oh, dude, Granny sex is the best.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.520]  Good luck as a couple.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.680]  Yeah, that's funny.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.360]  As soon as we logged into Facebook Live, people asked if we were going to hook up when we were done.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:35.600]  Yeah.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.680]  That's just the nature of the beast with the internet.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.200]  People have no lives sometimes.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.560]  Not everybody's trying to do something.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.720]  They're out there just trying to get noticed and that's their way to do it.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.520]  If you're not part of anything, you'll do your best to try to create something to be a part of.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.160]  Yes, anybody...
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.100]  Did I just say some profound shit on accident?
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.780]  It has me going, whoa, deep.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:00.340]  Miss Lindsey, the traveling stoner, remind everybody how they can find you because I
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:04.420]  think you promised us that by the time we record it again, you'd have a website ready to go.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:05.620]  Yes, I heard that too.
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:10.100]  So I have a photo shoot on the 16th of this month.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:15.140]  So I will be launching the website at the end of this month, actually, for real this time.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.120]  I have been working really hard on it so it will be coming out at the end of the month.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:24.680]  But for now, I am the traveling stoner on Instagram and Periscope.
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:33.960]  You can find me on Twitter as the travel stoner and you can find me on Snapchat as a travel
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.080]  and stoner without the G.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.760]  What's your home address?
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:37.800]  Yeah, no.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:40.920]  Wait, hold on.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.720]  What was that address?
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.200]  You sent me?
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:42.680]  Yeah, right.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.160]  Right.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.600]  Use maps to find where I live.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.000]  We're in an undisclosed bunker.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.600]  The studio needs a name.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.920]  Yes, you do because you know how Instagram has that little story?
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:59.800]  I deleted quite a few because I actually, I didn't even want to say the name of the city
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.440]  because I have learned people will try to find me.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:02.920]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:03.480]  Yeah.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.320]  So I just said I was being on your podcast.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:05.880]  There you go.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.960]  They don't know where you are.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:13.240]  And if you guys found me through Granny's feed by any way, if you learned of this podcast
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.940]  through Granny, send me a message or tag me in something and just say, hey, I found you
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.580]  through the diving Granny so that I can give her a hug for every one of those.
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.860]  Oh, lots of hugs.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.620]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:22.940]  All right.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.140]  So follow the traveling stoner.
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:24.460]  Thank you.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:26.460]  She's going to get her shit together and get her website up.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:26.780]  Yes.
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:27.580]  I'll take some pictures of you.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.380]  I got a cool camera.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.260]  I'm not even being creepy.
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:30.300]  I don't know where you want to go.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.740]  I'm not even being creepy.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.940]  I wasn't even going to take that way.
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.060]  I just didn't give you the chance.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:41.020]  Pretty sure I want the sun coming from that way and I need you over there and we'll fucking
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:41.900]  take pictures.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:42.300]  Perfect.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.240]  I usually just take pictures of weed to tell you the truth.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.920]  I'm going to be on a billboard on Colfax Avenue.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.760]  A real picture of me.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.120]  What?
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:51.760]  You should elaborate.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.560]  You didn't know this?
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:53.840]  Not in town.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.920]  You know that one hat pin?
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.800]  The tall one where I'm holding that teapot?
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.520]  Yeah.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:04.560]  THC, Sam and I had a photo shoot and they're putting me on a billboard.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.440]  Just say it's a photo shoot.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.360]  For THC magazine?
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.620]  No, this is for Ooze 420.
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:14.100]  Ooze 420?
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.140]  What kind of product is that?
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.340]  It's this little teapot thing that goes on a pin.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:21.220]  It's like a bubbler attachment that looks like a teapot.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.500]  I love smoking out of it.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.140]  Okay.
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:25.140]  Do an Instagram video with it so that we can see it.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:27.220]  No, we're going to go one better when that billboard's up.
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:30.340]  We're going to do a group dab up under the billboard.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:30.740]  I'm in.
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.300]  I'll take a grand dab hanging from the billboard.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.420]  Doesn't that sound like fun?
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:35.140]  Hanging.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:35.700]  I don't know how but.
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:36.900]  What are you, Brett?
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:37.460]  Spider-Man.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.380]  Made me think of a...
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:40.020]  What was that show?
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:40.660]  The Jew version of Spider-Man.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.560]  The 70s show.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.240]  They used to climb up the water tower.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.400]  I've climbed up a few water towers in my life.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.960]  Shout out to Brett, by the way.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.280]  Yes.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.400]  Yes, hey Brett.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:55.160]  Just for being awesome and for always being so positive and...
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.200]  Loving his videos.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:00.520]  Yes, and he's been sick lately so I hope you're getting over it there and you're feeling better
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.960]  by the time this comes out.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.800]  I want to get with him and do this cold terping thing that I've been hearing about.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.640]  If you've got some terps, I've got this device here that you've got to do.
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.020]  We'll guide you through that as soon as...
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.220]  Yeah, we'll wrap up here and do that.
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:14.940]  Look at the Colorado...
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.020]  It's got a little Colorado flag, Millie on there.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:17.820]  I saw that.
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:18.940]  Yeah, Chris made that for us.
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:19.660]  Chris made that.
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:20.460]  Yeah, it's all me.
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:21.500]  This is your Millie?
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.700]  Yeah, I made that whole thing.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.500]  That firearm closing that...
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.220]  That's all me.
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:25.420]  I'm very impressed.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.500]  It's my first functional.
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.020]  Since we're giving shout outs and stuff.
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:29.500]  It's just a straw.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:29.900]  That's super sweet.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:33.740]  I want to give a huge shout out and a heads up to our buddy, THC Sam.
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.340]  Sam wanted to come tonight.
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.300]  His life's been overwhelming.
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:39.340]  He got to interview Tommy Chong so he didn't have time to make it here today.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:40.460]  I get it.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.700]  I'm sorry, Tommy Chong, us?
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:43.180]  Yeah, go...
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:43.660]  No, go...
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.260]  He's a photographer.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.380]  He works for a magazine.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:51.180]  When somebody like Tommy Chong comes through town, your job is to go take pictures and do magazine shit.
[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:54.140]  Yes, it's a cannabis-based magazine.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:54.700]  So I guess...
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:55.260]  You have to...
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:55.980]  That's your job.
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:57.340]  Go do that.
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.100]  Sam, you've got an open invitation.
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.820]  There are three chairs here at the table that are available.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:03.980]  One of them has got your name on it whenever you want to come.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.740]  Also, Brett, I want to come get you...
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:09.260]  I want to get you to come be on the show here at my house where we've got this good studio.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.040]  The good mics where the equipment doesn't screw up.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:11.760]  We can be comfortable.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:12.160]  It's quiet.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.000]  Nobody interrupts other than you.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.200]  We can get you organized.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.880]  And Kabuki Fox.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.240]  I've had some real good conversations with him about CBDs.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.440]  Kabuki's been on a couple of times.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.880]  He's due for another episode.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.480]  We need to get him here again.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:31.040]  I'd love to have Kabuki across the table, talk about certain doses of specific cannabinoids for certain conditions.
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:37.200]  So between the CBDs and Brett with the Terps, we're talking new age medicine.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.080]  Yes, yes.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.140]  And Sam.
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:42.900]  Sam and I, I love to talk about traumatic brain injuries with Sam because of course,
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:45.380]  everybody knows that I've got a TBI that fucks me up.
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:46.740]  You hear it on the podcast occasionally.
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:50.180]  I just stop and start a brand new sentence because I don't know if I'm even saying it anymore.
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.100]  That's from getting hit in the head really, really hard.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.140]  You guys, that's what that is from.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.580]  I apologize when that shit happens.
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:58.580]  I also want to say that Sam is actually running this food drive with us as well.
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:09:59.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:01.220]  We forgot to even like...
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.380]  That's why Sam was supposed to be here tonight.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:04.340]  Exactly.
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:05.140]  Uh, duh.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:06.340]  Maybe one dab.
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.300]  I know, right?
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.280]  Sorry about that, Sam.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.600]  I'm sorry I did a suppository before we came here.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.400]  But yes, Sam is also another big part of helping us getting this food drive together.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.600]  As is, uh, the people over at the...
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:18.920]  Yes.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.200]  At the Glass Grind, yes.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.040]  I spaced out on her Instagram name.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:22.840]  I know it's blown...
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:23.800]  Cloudy Cody.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.040]  Yep.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.680]  She's going to help us with the flyers.
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.000]  Yes.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.760]  I'm glad we caught up on that and didn't skip people.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.240]  Yes.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:31.720]  That's all right.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.440]  We're all high here.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.160]  It's good.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.440]  It's a cannabis podcast.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.080]  People understand.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:35.880]  Too many dabs.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.580]  Oh, bro, I forgot.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:40.540]  Well, at least we told them what the, you know, food drive was about.
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.460]  And we said we're still kind of...
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.140]  It's not concrete yet.
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:46.860]  We have until Friday to get them dab boxes out.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:47.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:50.780]  And you know, we still have three spots open for people, so...
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.180]  Bobo, I did not forget you, bro.
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:54.060]  No, down there.
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:54.700]  I pay attention.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.420]  I made a mental note.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.860]  We still got to let Bobo do plugs.
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:57.340]  Yes, yes.
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:58.460]  You still doing the burnisher thing?
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:00.300]  Is that still available on bigcartel.com?
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:00.940]  Yeah, still there.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.580]  That's still there.
[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:02.460]  That's still active.
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.660]  I'm still doing that.
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.260]  Um, I don't get too many orders.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.600]  I'm not super, super busy, but I'm still doing them.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.200]  They're still available.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.120]  I still do custom stuff with that as well.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.200]  Focusing pretty heavily on the new glass game.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.240]  Yeah, that's my new gig.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.880]  So follow the new glass page, right?
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.480]  Yes, follow the new glass page.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.880]  I have no me glass.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.280]  It's N-O-M-E glass.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.600]  And you can also follow my normal Instagram is boboblasterco.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.840]  That's a B-O-B-O blaster C-O.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.620]  And it's the same thing on Periscope.
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:36.820]  Uh, and I think that's all I'm on.
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:38.180]  Yeah, that's about it.
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.900]  You're not one of those people that's on every single social media.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:41.940]  I'm barely on those.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:42.900]  I try to.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:47.060]  Yeah, I tried to catch on Periscope the other day, but you were like logging off right as I got in there.
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.260]  Yeah, I go through spurs where I'm like,
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:49.700]  Boston Jeff is here, Bobo's gone.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:51.860]  I was so happy to see him today.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:54.260]  And I just thought of somebody else we need to shout out.
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.660]  Color Me Filthy.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:57.460]  Yeah.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.100]  Oh, yeah.
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:01.700]  This is a new artist I've just become friends with on Instagram.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:02.520]  Zombie artist?
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:02.920]  Yeah.
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:03.480]  Yes.
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.400]  And he's embracing my friends.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.960]  He's and his name is Paul Color Me Filthy.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.680]  Yes.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.600]  We're part of his little family.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.080]  Yeah.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:11.720]  That's pretty cool.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.800]  I like the zombie photos I've been seeing of everybody.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:15.640]  Turning you guys all green, killing everybody.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.800]  Just make stickers out of all those.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.040]  I think they're pretty cool what he's been doing to my friends.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.560]  I think I'm addicted to bitmojis.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.760]  You are so obsessed.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.840]  That's the funnest shit ever.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.120]  It is so funny.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.080]  Put a little Rasta Jeff everywhere doing different funny shit.
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:31.820]  It's so rad.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:32.940]  It's so rad.
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:33.660]  I'm obsessed.
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:34.460]  You're correct.
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:34.940]  I know.
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:35.500]  All right, you guys.
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.580]  Of course, you can find me on, I'm on all of the damn social medias.
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:43.100]  On Twitter, it's at GFYHpodcast is probably the best way to find me.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:46.140]  On Instagram, it would be really rad if you follow me on Instagram.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:48.220]  It's at Irie underscore genetics.
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:51.820]  Hopefully by the time this episode comes out, I'll be at 10,000 followers.
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:55.260]  You can find me on Facebook, The Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.980]  I think that's enough of that social media stuff.
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.340]  I don't need to pitch too many more of them.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.640]  I think that's all we're going to do for today.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.800]  I want to thank everybody for coming, especially Granny.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.480]  You've got an hour drive home, so we're going to-
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.520]  I bet it was worth it.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.320]  We're going to let you sober up so you're not medicated for the drive.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:10.800]  Oh, of course not.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.360]  Wink, wink, wink.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.320]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.360]  Right.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:16.800]  And then, yeah, the rest of us are going to get high as shit because we don't have too far to go.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.280]  Yeah.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.120]  You're going to just sit here and watch, Granny.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:19.520]  Yes.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:19.760]  Yes.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.080]  You have to be safe and sober for your drive home, all of us.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:22.560]  Yes.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:26.560]  I'm here at my table, so I'm going to take a gram dab.
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:29.780]  I'll just have to have some green crack before I go, so I'm wide awake.
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:30.260]  There you go.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:34.100]  We may do a little Facebook Live video or something here,
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.020]  since we've got a whole bunch of cool-ass people in the building.
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:36.500]  A gram dab.
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:36.980]  Yeah.
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:37.540]  Yeah.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:37.860]  Yeah.
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:38.100]  All right.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:39.380]  So we're going to wrap up the podcast.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:40.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you guys for listening.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:43.620]  Of course, I'm going to say that thing where if you want to go to iTunes and leave us a review,
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.980]  that would be super duper cool.
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.820]  I will read your review on a future episode.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:50.180]  If you've got anything that you'd like to say and you do not want to do it in a public forum
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:51.380]  on social media, send me an email.
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:53.620]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:54.980]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.200]  If you want some grow lessons, if you need some advice, if you just want to say what's up,
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.040]  if you want to tell me to go fuck myself, I'm down.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:00.360]  Send it.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.560]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.680]  Good or bad, I ain't scared.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.800]  I want to know what people are thinking.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:04.280]  I'm into it.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:04.920]  Be honest with me.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.720]  I'm a blunt person.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.400]  I like honesty.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.400]  So that's all I've got for you this week.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.760]  Big shout out to the dabbing granny.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.720]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:20:06.960]  It's all the waiting in vain.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:07.120]  Yeah.
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.400]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.080]  It's time for episode number 167 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:15.220]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:16.100]  That's right.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:19.860]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:23.620]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:26.900]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:28.340]  I'm your host.
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.180]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.860]  I want to thank you guys once again for joining me.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:34.980]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.540]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:40.980]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.840]  I almost got through that whole thing without coughing.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.960]  I had to cough right in the middle there.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.760]  You guys did not hear it.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.880]  I could have snuck that through.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.800]  Oh, man.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.480]  Good coughs, but shout out to my buddy, Frosty Organics for bringing some frosty gorilla glue
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:51.720]  over here.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.920]  Dude, that was delicious.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.360]  Yes, yes, yes, man.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:54.600]  Yeah.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.360]  Welcome to the podcast, bro.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:01.480]  A newcomer, someone who has not been on yet, but I promised him our no-till guest is here.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, Frosty Organics on Instagram.
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.360]  Make sure you give him a follow.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.240]  Dude, welcome to the show.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:06.200]  Thank you.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:06.600]  Thank you.
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.840]  I'm super happy to be here.
[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:11.260]  Been waiting to be on here for a little bit.
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:14.780]  I've been listening to this for a few years now.
[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:19.260]  So yeah, I said show up and I said, message me and we can have you show up.
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.900]  And the minute that episode came out, you sent me a message on Instagram.
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:22.940]  You're like, hey, dude, I want to be on the show.
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:23.900]  Let's get this together.
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.420]  Yeah, I was super pumped.
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:25.820]  Nice.
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.020]  Well, welcome to the show.
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:27.660]  Glad to have you here.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:29.660]  We're going to talk about no-till, obviously, today, you guys.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:32.700]  I've got to introduce another newcomer sitting across from me.
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:36.300]  This guy is visiting from, are you visiting from North Carolina?
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.020]  Yeah, totally.
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:37.980]  He's sharing a mic with Will.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.640]  So he's going to have to kind of lean in a little bit, but he's visiting from North Carolina.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.120]  Welcome to the show.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.200]  Our new friend, I want to say Logan, right?
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:43.600]  Yeah.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:43.920]  Nice.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.520]  I was told your name once and I remembered it.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.160]  Yeah, man.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:46.400]  Good.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.040]  Jeff, is that your name?
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:47.280]  Yes.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:47.600]  Yes.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:47.920]  Yes.
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:48.160]  Nice.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:48.880]  Nice.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.160]  Very good to meet you, brother.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.520]  You're in from North Carolina, right?
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:52.480]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.880]  Cannabis is not legal there, is it?
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:55.520]  No, not at all.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.960]  Is this some culture shock to be able to come out here and just drive around with weed in the car?
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.360]  Well, honestly, I've been smoking since a very young age with old Will over here, actually.
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:11.060]  And so it's nothing weird to me, you know, because the taboo is broken for myself.
[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:11.300]  Okay.
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:14.100]  But to be out here, it's so much more comfortable.
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:14.340]  Nice.
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:17.620]  Like there's not, there's always like this looming, like impending doom.
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:19.700]  But North Carolina is actually decriminalized too.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:23.860]  So like if you get pulled over with weed and you're not acting like a total, like jackass,
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:24.660]  you're probably going to be all right.
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:25.700]  You'll probably get that ticket.
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:31.060]  It's going to cost like, I don't know, $250 to $500, but you know, it's going to suck.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:32.020]  Better than going to jail.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:33.540]  Yeah, it's better than going to jail.
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.640]  But you know, you never know what's going to happen.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:36.200]  Nice.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.720]  Thanks for joining us on the podcast, bro.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.200]  Yeah, totally.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.920]  If you feel like taking a dab or anything, man, reach over, grab any of the Shatter,
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.200]  any of the rigs, it's all available.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.800]  I'm about to load one up.
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:44.440]  There you go, bro.
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.080]  Here's a dab.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.520]  Actually, here's a dab on this dab.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.880]  Or if you want to take that man-sized dab, don't hurt yourself or do.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:51.960]  All right.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.480]  You guys heard me mention him.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.840]  I'm trying so hard not to cough, you guys.
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.280]  We've been taking mad dabs over here.
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.920]  Our friend from Barefoot Extracts, also the Barefoot Growers across the table from me.
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:01.800]  Welcome, Barefoot.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.440]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:03.100]  Should we call you Will?
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:03.820]  Call you Barefoot?
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:05.180]  Barefoot Will, whatever you want to call me.
[01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.020]  That beard is coming in manly.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:07.660]  Oh, appreciate it, man.
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:09.260]  I've been getting a lot of compliments on it lately.
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:09.900]  It's kind of funny.
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:10.860]  Did you trim it up?
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.220]  Did you even it out or something?
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.860]  Yeah, every couple weeks I'll go through and kind of hit it.
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:15.980]  Just kind of get the loose ones.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:18.300]  Evening, give it a thickness, bro.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:19.020]  It's manly now.
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.780]  You're about to raid some villages or something.
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:24.860]  Yeah, yeah, awesome.
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:29.180]  You guys, we're going to talk about No-Till, but before we get that far, I want to thank
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.400]  these guys for joining me because they've been here for like an hour and 20 minutes
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.400]  and all we've done is take dabs and bullshit.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.480]  So thanks for taking time out of your evening.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.360]  Just ripping a water bottle at me like I'm having fun.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.160]  Don't worry.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:40.640]  Thanks for joining me.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.320]  I know you got kids, dude, so thanks for coming over.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.640]  Everybody's got a garden and a life, so thanks for joining me.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.440]  Also, I need to give a huge shout out to my friends at thedankteam.com.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.120]  That's right, thedankteam.com.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:53.280]  If you need some new genetics for your garden, some feminized or regular seeds, check out
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.800]  thedankteam.com.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:58.080]  Let them know that you heard about them on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:00.820]  Also, shout out to our friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.900]  We got some cool shit coming up from our friends at Handmade.
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:03.940]  Just want to give them a shout out.
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:09.060]  And also, I owe a huge shout out to my friend Task Rock at Highly Educated Titanium.
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:10.260]  The other day I went to the mailbox.
[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:10.900]  I didn't feel good.
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:11.620]  I didn't feel worth a shit.
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:13.460]  I ate something that kicked my ass.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:17.940]  Man, I was not living, but I went to the mailbox and I opened up the mail and there was a gift
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:21.300]  in the mail from Task Rock at Highly Educated Titanium.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:27.460]  I got the new, it's a quartz and titanium combo domeless e-nail.
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.520]  Of course, domeless, right?
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.800]  I still say domeless.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.520]  That's like a thing.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:35.160]  Back in the day, you guys, we used to put a dome on the dab rig, but it's a titanium
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:41.240]  nail with a quartz dish with a little protective titanium shroud, I think is the appropriate
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:41.480]  word.
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.880]  It's got like a shield around it so that you can carry your quartz nail with you and you
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:49.640]  don't have to feel as paranoid like you're going to break it because I'm a breaky guy.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:53.240]  I like to break glass shit and I will break a quartz nail.
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.640]  So now I've got a quartz nail that I will not break.
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:59.660]  It is able to be attached to my barrel style e-nail coil.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:04.940]  I like it much better on my flat e-nail coil and it's also able to be used without the
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:07.180]  e-nail setup as just an on the go nail.
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:08.940]  So big shout out to Task.
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:09.820]  Thank you.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:11.020]  That's a sweet product.
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:13.420]  I think I like it a lot better with the flat coil.
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:16.540]  I think it's going to end up being used mostly with a torch.
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:18.700]  I didn't like it as much with the barrel coil.
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:20.620]  It didn't heat up the way I wanted it to heat up.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:21.580]  I take globs, you guys.
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:23.100]  It would work for you probably.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:26.000]  But everybody over here was like, your nail is hot.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:26.720]  They're all making this.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.200]  Everybody that hit my e-nail is looking at me like, your fucking nail is hot.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:29.920]  My throat hurts.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.400]  But big shout out to those guys.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:32.800]  All right.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.480]  Let's talk about some no-till.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:39.040]  Last time Will was here and he kind of led on a little bit about no-till growing and I said,
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.200]  elaborate and he said, you got to get Frosty over.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.800]  So we've got Frosty Organics over.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.320]  We're going to talk about no-till.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:47.520]  I should ask Frosty a couple of questions before we do that, bro.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.720]  How long have you been growing cannabis?
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:52.500]  Really, really growing, like for real growing.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:55.060]  I'd say a little over two years.
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:55.620]  Oh shit.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:57.860]  So you've just been getting at this and you're good at it.
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:07.620]  Yeah, probably, probably closer to three years, but you know, like really figuring out what I was doing and doing it correctly.
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:10.180]  I'd say about two years.
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:10.660]  Okay.
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:14.180]  How long into your grow career did you decide to go no-till?
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:17.240]  Probably a year.
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:17.720]  Okay.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.160]  So you've been at the no-till for like a year?
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:19.640]  A year.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.120]  All right.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:20.920]  And you're good at it, bro.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:22.680]  Because that Gorilla Glue 4 you brought.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.160]  Oh yeah.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.120]  That is frosty as shit.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.080]  It lives up to your name.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.600]  My soil is good at it.
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:27.160]  Okay.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:27.720]  All right.
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:30.840]  Ooh, I like the way this guy thinks.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.600]  So you're making, where'd you get your soil recipe?
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.560]  There's a guy that I've been following for a while.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.560]  He's a guy that I've been following for a while.
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:45.260]  His name is Koot on Instagram.
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:45.740]  Okay.
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:46.300]  Clackamascuskoot.
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:46.860]  Clackamaskoot.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:47.820]  Clackamaskoot's old school.
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:48.060]  Yeah.
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:48.220]  Yeah.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.180]  Clackamaskoot's old school.
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:51.820]  When you said Koot, I thought that might be who you're talking about.
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:55.740]  He's really into like K and F, like Korean natural farming.
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:55.980]  Yeah.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.020]  You know, and stuff like that.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:03.820]  So we really, everybody I think that does no-till is like basically based off of his soil recipe.
[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:04.300]  Okay.
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:10.220]  We took his soil recipe and we made a little, like a little, like a little, like a little,
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:14.000]  his soil recipe and then just added our own things into it.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.800]  But he's really like the founder of no-till.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:17.360]  Nice.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:17.760]  Okay.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.720]  So tell us, since we're talking about who the founder is,
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:23.600]  tell us a little about what's the difference between no-till and
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.040]  what most of us are probably doing.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.600]  Most of us are probably going to the store, getting bottles,
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:30.220]  mixing shit up in a shot glass, weighing it out into a bucket,
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.480]  pouring it in, mixing it up and make sure the pH is right and then pouring that onto our plants.
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.760]  So teach us a little about the difference of what no-till is.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:43.040]  is? Well, no till is just basically kind of like living soil. Living soil is basically
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:46.760]  a super soil that everybody's doing. So everybody got into an organic way and they're like,
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:51.440]  well, you can feed, you know, just water to this soil and your plants will do what it's
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:58.480]  supposed to. So basically all the inputs in your soil is doing what it's supposed to for
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:05.080]  you. So like in nature, you don't see anything in nature doesn't get fed with a bottle. It's
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:10.160]  already in the dirt and it eats it as it's supposed to get to what it wants. It breaks
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:14.120]  it down naturally because the decomposition happens from other things in the earth and
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:20.540]  the worms and poop. And so then that's available as needed by the plant and the plant isn't
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:23.880]  force fed basically or starving for anything, hopefully.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:29.200]  And so, and so I was doing super soil there for a while. Super soil is okay. Sometimes
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:36.600]  your soil is too hot. They put too many amendments in it or maybe the amendments that are in
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:41.360]  there for deep in flower, because you might've put your soil together a little bit before
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.520]  you threw it into flower, you know, a late in veg or something like that. You might've
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.360]  transplanted to your five gallon right before you threw it into flower. You might start
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:54.640]  getting too heavy of newts, you know, or I guess natural amendments being broken down
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:01.240]  and feeding your plants too hot and it'll burn your plants. So I guess the way to get
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:07.240]  away from that is to just the natural way with no till is to have basically the same
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:12.600]  thing, but then we have like compost and then we have, you know, worms in there. I don't
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:18.960]  put worms in there. I just put earthworm castings from a guy here in town named Don.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.440]  Shout out to Don.
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:28.320]  Yeah, he has the greatest earthworm castings ever, but it has cocoons in it. So those worms
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.040]  will come to life after like, you know, a few days actually, you know, it'll have little
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:37.280]  worms in there too, you know, little bitty worms and stuff in there already. So, you
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.080]  know, once they start getting fed and stuff like that, you just need to have mulch on
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.960]  top because what you want to do is you want to keep a, basically you want to just keep
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:50.680]  your, your, your soil very, very moist on top just because you want your worms to come
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:56.360]  to the top and to break down all your top dressings. Okay. So whenever you do a transplant
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:30:00.960]  from your one gallon, so usually in a one gallon when I veg, I just use like some shitty
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:06.400]  soil, you know, something that's very base, you know, you could use pro mix if you wanted,
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:12.000]  you know, I mean, if that's what you chose, I use more something that, you know, shout
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.280]  out to Don again, Don makes a base soil for me. I just put my plants in there in one gallons.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:23.880]  I veg them with just water only just for like a month, three weeks. After that, I put them
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:29.540]  into their, their new pot and then I veg them for a week in their, in their no-till pots,
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:32.440]  but their no-till pots are already working and already, already inoculated.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:37.600]  Okay. So let's talk about what goes into that. Let's talk about what goes into that no-till
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:44.040]  pot before we put the plants in it. And how long before I put my one gallon pot into that
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:48.600]  no-till, do I want to get that mixed up? Do I need some time to let it get cooking?
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:54.480]  You do for sure. If you want to make it on your own, you can buy a soil mix now that
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:31:01.040]  is basically coots mix plus all the extra things we're putting in it. For a few years,
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:05.960]  you know, we were having to, you know, make our soil mixes and put all these extra things
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.120]  in it. Then we started buying like a soil mix on Build A Soil. And we still have to
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:14.520]  put extra things in it, you know, to make it exactly what you want it to be rich enough
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:18.360]  to be able to go all through flower and stuff like that, to have your worms and your microbe
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:24.560]  life and your beneficials really working, you know? And so, um, after, after we, uh,
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.920]  you know, we're doing that for a while now, he came out with a, it's called a modern mix
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:33.600]  version 2.0. Okay. I'm going to write that down. It has, uh, um, what is the compost
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:39.040]  in it? Will? Oh, I'm not sure. It's from, um, Malibu compost. Okay. I've only heard
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.520]  good things about those guys. One of the richest compost. I've ever used. The only thing bad
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:46.160]  I've heard about them is it's hard to get sometimes it is very hard to get. All right.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:50.640]  Very, very hard to get. Must be good shit then. Super good shit. Um, Jeremy started
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:57.080]  making a, a super good soil though. So, um, I've used his soil, uh, a few times now on,
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:03.080]  uh, a few new pots that I've had to put together on some new rooms. Um, but all my older pots
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:07.460]  that are like four or five rounds in, I built those like all the way up. Like we, we mix
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:13.040]  the compost, we mix the soil. We had to, you know, mix, uh, each amendment and you know,
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.120]  one cup to each cubic foot, you know what I'm saying? Okay. And we had to, you know,
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:21.960]  had to mix it up and then, uh, I guess you'd have it sit there for maybe like a week or
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:25.560]  two, but then you would just, you know, put everything in there, put your top dress on
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:31.460]  there. Um, you know, put your earthworm castings in there. You'd put your, uh, your, your cover
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:34.780]  crop and stuff like that. And then I just let it come to life. And then by the time
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:39.060]  you put your plan in there, it's already working and it'll just overtake your plan. Okay. So
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:41.660]  if you even put shitty soil in there, it'll overtake that shit.
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:45.020]  Right. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. And you can start with old, shitty recycled soil. You
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:49.460]  guys, I like to take my old soil that plants have already been in and I will put clones
[01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:54.260]  in it. The clones, if you got a clone from me, chances are it came in recycled soil,
[01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:57.500]  but it was treated. There are no bugs in it. It's been flushed. It's happy. Look how good
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:01.140]  your clones look. Don't be mad. It looks good. All right. So you can start in shitty soil.
[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:05.500]  If you're going into no till. So you've got it set up about a week in advance. Do we want
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:09.260]  to put water in there after we've got all the nutrients and all the amendments in there
[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:11.860]  and the soil in there? Do we want to water it a week in advance or do you just want to
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:15.020]  let it sit kind of, do you want it moist or do you want it kind of dry?
[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:17.900]  You should water it. Okay. Definitely. Water. All right. So that'll get it kind of moving
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:21.660]  in there and get all that going. Okay. Get everything. Get it congealed together. Keep
[01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:25.740]  your beneficials eaten and stuff like that. Cause whenever we put those earthworm castings
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:30.220]  in there, they definitely already have a lot of beneficials and stuff in there working
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:35.980]  with the worms. Cause you know, just it's so rich that that shit's so rich. It comes
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:39.580]  so fresh. He gives it to us fresh out of the compost of the worms.
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:42.700]  Oh, nice. He's got it going on over there. Yeah. It sounds like it. I know another guy
[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:45.980]  that had something similar and I've seen it. It's beautiful. All right. So you can get
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:49.660]  them to load, load, get your pots loaded up about a week in advance. Uh, check out the
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:54.380]  modern mix 2.0. That's a good start. You might want to add some stuff. Uh, check out sub
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:59.900]  cools, uh, super soil recipe, and it's going to be similar the way he throws a tarp on
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:04.060]  the ground and mixes the super soil. It's the same idea. What we're trying to do here.
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:09.380]  We're just using a different mix. Check out the modern mix 2.0. Find your own recipe on
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:13.820]  making some no till soil and perfect it for your plants. You'll get a good start with
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:17.100]  the modern mix 2.0. It sounds like, but your plants are going to want different shit. You're
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:21.860]  going to need to protect, uh, perfect it for each plant, but this is a good start. Uh,
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:27.020]  then get your plants into there about a week. Uh, after you make the mix, then you said
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.660]  mulch, you want to keep mulch on top to keep the worms feeding. What are we going to use
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:34.460]  for mulch? You can use old stems, you know, um, old branches and stuff like that from
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:39.420]  old harvest. Can I take the leaves that I'm lollipopping? Oh man. So there's food already
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:45.460]  available for the cover crop as it's growing. Oh, okay. So cover crop, what am I growing
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:52.340]  as cover crop? Lots of clover, clover, come free. Okay. You got to think lemongrass will,
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:56.260]  you know, keep bugs away. So you're growing lemongrass right there. You know, it's keeping
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:59.700]  bugs away. I'm just going to ask about some pest management and no till here in a couple
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:02.780]  of seconds, but it sounds like we're there. Lemongrass. What else can I use to keep the
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:10.300]  pests away on my no till crop? Um, eucalyptus, uh, rosemary. Okay. Those types of essential
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:16.860]  oils. Okay. You know, natural stuff like that. Um, I don't really spray a neem oil on my
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:22.260]  plants. I like Karanja oil. Okay. Has a more milder smell and it's a, it's, it's easier
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:25.260]  to, uh, I don't know, to fuck with, you know, it's just easier to make some stuff. Yeah.
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:28.540]  There's something about neem oil when we, when you said it, my face wrinkled up a little
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:33.420]  bit. There's something if, if you get a tiny drop of neem oil on anything, it feels like
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:37.340]  I can taste it for a week. Like even if it gets on my hand, I can taste it. And I know
[01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:41.620]  that sounds crazy, but it doesn't go away. It's the most terrible flavor ever. Uh, but
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:45.900]  yeah, I've used plenty of neem oil on stuff, but okay. So basically essential oils will
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:49.900]  help you keep your pests away. Grow the lemongrass in there. It works as cover crop and it's
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:53.420]  going to keep some bugs out. That's fucking smooth. I like that. It's good thinking. All
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:56.580]  right. So that's the basics to get you started and set up. What else do we need to think
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:01.700]  about? We've got mulch, we've got cover crop, we've got some good hot soil to keep us cooking.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:05.620]  Basically you're just growing now, right? You got to water them when they're thirsty.
[01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:10.020]  Watered do some top dresses. Top dresses. Okay. What are we going to use for top dress?
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:14.740]  Worm castings? Yeah. You're going to do some, uh, some neem meals, neem seed meal. Neem
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:19.500]  seed meal. Sorry. That's a lot of words. Yeah. It's weird. Neem seed meal, kelp meal, uh,
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:26.020]  chars good. Uh, worm casting some fish compost is real good. Okay. Yeah. Alfalfa meals real
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:30.100]  good. Especially, uh, like just right when you transplant and get a fresh dose of nitrogen
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:34.480]  right to them right when they're transplanted. I feel like kelp and sea products completely
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:40.780]  add to the flavors and aromas and density a lot. So I do a neem and kelp tea every like
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:46.500]  other watering. Do you ever foliar feed with your teas that you make? Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:51.260]  I mean, I don't really make teas anymore. Um, it's just more about just top dressings.
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:56.580]  Like whenever you go into flower, um, malted barley once a week, a lot of enzymes and stuff
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:37:00.420]  like that. Sugars, you know, stuff like that. It'll make your buds real sweet, make them
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:04.580]  dense up and stuff like that. You know, I do a lot of, uh, potassium silicate too. You
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:09.740]  know, what do you use? Um, I just still 16 H I just make my own, I just make my own,
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:13.660]  uh, you know, liquid of it and stuff like that. I've been using the bottled Osa. I'm
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:17.780]  still a baby over here from Jeremy. That's where it's at. Okay. Yeah. I want to say 28
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:20.860]  is good though. I mean, I used to use that whenever I was doing super souls and stuff.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:25.620]  It seems like build a soil gets a lot of free shout outs on this podcast. They've got everything
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:28.940]  you need. Oh, they have everything. You can just click on their website and you can literally
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:32.980]  build a soil. If you have a question, they've got a chart. He's got a regimen for everything
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:38.740]  on there. It's awesome. It's so basic. So, uh, man, we can get, I had one of my basic
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:42.380]  questions here is how do we start, but you go get some modern mix 2.0 and you get some
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:45.300]  pots filled with any water, I'm going to grow some clones and then you throw it in
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:48.260]  there and then you pay attention. And then the next time you're going to have to add
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:52.500]  amendments. So we've got our mulch, we've got our cover crop. Uh, we've taken care of
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:58.620]  our pests. Basically we're flushing the whole time, right? Sort of. You're not flushing.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:02.540]  You're basically just feeding your worms. So basically you're just feeding the worms
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:07.340]  in there. Forget about the worms in there. That's so awesome. And so the worms are shitting,
[01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:12.540]  you know, and then the beneficials come and break down the, the worm poop and then the
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:20.740]  worm poop turns into a hummus. Okay. All right. Now at the end you cut down your plant, it's
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:26.380]  done. Uh, do you just dig a little hole next to that stock and put your next clone right
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:29.860]  in there? How are you getting it started again? Just rip your root ball. I'll just rip that
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:34.220]  sucker right out. Okay. Try to get as little, you don't want it to take the root ball out,
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:38.780]  you want to get as little dirt out as possible. Okay. Cause you don't want to add any new
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:42.580]  soil to it. You want to just keep using the same soil over and over. The only thing you
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:47.420]  want to add is new amendments and new top dresses. Okay. Compost. Yeah. Compost. If
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:52.620]  you needed to add more like soil or if you transplanted and needed to, uh, add something
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:56.340]  to actually transplant, you would just put compost and earthworm castings and stuff.
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:59.460]  Okay. Just, yeah, I would just fill that hole with worm castings. I love doing that when
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:03.260]  I transplant, I just put a nice layer of castings. I'll throw some, some great white shark or
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:08.940]  something in there and get that moving. Yeah. Okay. All right. And then what are you going
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:14.860]  to reamendment reamend it with the second time? Um, worm castings, compost, top dresses
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:19.780]  really. It's less of a reamendment and more just top dressing, refeeding everything. Okay.
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:23.460]  Neem kill biochar. Yeah, exactly. Is the cover crop going to just keep growing? Is that like
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:28.460]  a perpetual thing now? Oh yeah. You cut it, it goes back, it's tight. Oh, okay. It'll,
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:31.740]  it'll yeah. The stuff that you cut off, can you throw that into a tee and make kind of
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:35.540]  a compost tee out of it? If you're using comfrey and stuff like that, yeah. I just
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:39.420]  usually use it as mulch on top of the top though. You guys don't go to the growth store
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:44.740]  anymore. No, no, no. I mean, even if you wanted to, you know, make your own, you know, basically
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:49.900]  like if you want to push your plants extra hard, you can use like calfos and stuff like
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:55.020]  that. You can make your own calcium and phosphorus, you know? Yeah. It sounds like this, all these
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:58.500]  processes are super sustainable, you know, like especially once you get to like a certain
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:02.620]  level. And so that's just, that's great for your soil anyway. You know, you're just like
[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:07.940]  building your own little like ecosystem, like out of dirt. Yeah. And one of the major problems
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:12.700]  of homegrowing is that when you're done, you've got all this trash. You've got sticks, you've
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:17.900]  got leaves, you've got pot, you've got dirt bottles. Yeah. Thanks. I didn't even think
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:21.540]  about the bottles. The bottles you could throw in the trash, but it's all that dirt. Like
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:26.260]  I grow, when I used to have, I had an old trap house where I would do like 20, how many
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:30.140]  did I do? I think there's 28, seven gallon pots and that's a lot of soil when you're
[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:34.340]  done. And I would have to find somewhere smooth to throw all that away. And luckily I have
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:37.860]  a friend who grows an outdoor vegetable garden and I would just have him come pick it all
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:40.420]  up in his truck and he would just haul it off for me in the middle of the night. But
[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:44.660]  if I didn't have that hookup, what am I going to do with 28, seven gallon pots worth of
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:48.700]  soil? You guys don't even have to worry about that. Your worms just go in there like, oh,
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:54.460]  you need new dirt. We got you covered Brian. You just keep it moving. That's pretty sweet.
[01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:57.820]  That is pretty sweet. Yeah. So, and then you get to throw your sticks in there and
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:00.220]  you're also composting. You guys run it in a Bokashi bucket?
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:03.820]  No, I don't do that. No, I love my Bokashi bucket.
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:09.540]  I mean, you can, I mean, I like to make, you know, some fermentation and stuff like that.
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:16.860]  Like you can make a, you know, like a fermented fruit and stuff like that. You know, stuff
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:19.500]  like that. And it's just like super beneficial for your plants.
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:21.340]  Sounds like you hang out with Sean a little bit.
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:24.940]  Yeah. Yeah. Fruit extracts and stuff.
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:27.820]  All right. Do you use a lot of aloe vera in anything you do?
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:29.740]  Oh yeah. You need a lot of, uh, every time.
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:32.860]  The plants love that stuff, don't they? And coconut.
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:34.060]  Yeah. The coconut water.
[01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:36.060]  You need a lot of enzymes to help break down.
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:40.860]  Yes. Yeah. I love drinking coconut water myself. I feel super hydrated and I feel like if I feed
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:42.860]  that to the plants, they've got to feel the same way.
[01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:44.380]  Oh yeah. That's a great enzyme.
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:45.340]  That just cools you down.
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:46.620]  That was my favorite.
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:49.740]  Okay. The stuff that comes out of the Bokashi bucket will break down all that old stuff.
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:52.940]  We actually just started using that at work, not out of the bucket, but we just started using
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:57.260]  the Bokashi at work to help break down compost in our beds.
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:00.140]  Yeah. It'll speed it up. It'll give you that white funk layer too.
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:03.420]  Oh, that beautiful mycelium layer that people get afraid of.
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:03.740]  That's the truth.
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:04.140]  Oh yeah.
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:04.780]  I've seen people-
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:08.540]  My buddy, he just started growing organics. This is his first time ever growing. He decided to go
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:12.940]  in and had organics and he got a nice layer of mycelium on his plants and he sent me a message,
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:16.780]  dude, I think I fucked up. My plants got mold on them. And I was like, no dude,
[01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:19.260]  you're doing it perfectly. That's exactly what you want.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:22.460]  He was like, I get it now.
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:27.820]  Yeah. People freak out. I see it on Facebook or Instagram every once in a while. Like,
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:32.300]  oh shit, my soil is making shrooms. What do I do? I'm like, nothing. Just exactly what you're
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:36.620]  doing. There's just the right humidity and the right fucking pH in there to where you're growing
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:39.340]  shrooms. Yeah. That's going to fall apart.
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:40.140]  You're rising super rich.
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:43.420]  Yeah. It's going to fall apart back into the soil and your plant's going to eat that. It's
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:46.140]  going to be awesome. Keep it going. Don't do anything differently.
[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:51.020]  So I wrote down how cost effective is this? Sounds like it's a one-time deal, right?
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:51.420]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:56.940]  Most part, yeah. I mean, you got to occasionally buy more worm castings. You might have to buy
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:01.820]  some more neem and kelp meal because I do neem and kelp teas. I just do those every third watering,
[01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:05.900]  I think. And then as top dresses as well, depending on how much you're doing. But as far
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:10.940]  as the soil goes, yeah, it's basically you're not buying seven bags of soil every time you need to
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:11.500]  do transplants.
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.740]  Right. Yeah. 28, seven gallon pots.
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:14.220]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:19.740]  They're just still there moving. And then you don't have to... It sounds like a lot of work,
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:22.860]  but it also sounds like it's saving me a whole bunch of work.
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:23.500]  In the long run, yeah.
[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:28.140]  I don't have to go to the growth store and buy bottles, which are expensive. And that's a lot
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:32.060]  of... I'm paying for the water to be shipped, it feels like, essentially, because I read the
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:35.100]  ingredients and all that shit's available at Build a Soil in a Dry Form.
[01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:38.700]  Well, the difference between potassium silicate, like we were talking, if you get
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:42.780]  pre-mixed potassium silicate in a bottle, it's going to cost like, I mean, 10 times more,
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:48.940]  if not more than that, than what the bag of the powder comes in. And you can make 10 times as
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:51.020]  much that comes in the bottle with that. It's crazy.
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:56.540]  Now you got me rethinking everything I do and have ever done.
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:59.100]  Oh, yeah. You can make a gallon with 568 grams.
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:01.020]  Yeah, easily. Yeah. I mean, that's what it is.
[01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:02.380]  Of potassium silicate.
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:03.820]  148 grams a liter.
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:06.540]  I mean, that's simple.
[01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:13.820]  Yeah. Okay. Man, I wish I could... I want to start off just like one or two pots of some
[01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:19.260]  stuff and just see if I can see what it does. Run it next to my Botanic Air Grow or whatever
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:20.860]  brand I'm using, my Veg Bloom.
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:23.180]  Oh, it'll kill them. It'll overtake them.
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:28.540]  You'll probably even see beneficials might even hop into your other soil, if you get your other
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:32.060]  soil hopping that well, if it's really going... Because they'll want to go... They're going to
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:36.540]  want to spread out. They're going to want to go to where they're going to be needed.
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:39.260]  That's rad. So it's going to just move over to the other pots and be like,
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:40.460]  oh, hey, you look lonely.
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:45.660]  It'll help you get rid of some PM if you have anything in there. The good, as Frosty always says.
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:52.300]  Oh, yeah. I mean, there's plenty of things. Lactobacillus serum. I had a buddy that had
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:56.780]  some other plants that got some PM on them. And I was like, you want to get rid of that real quick?
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:01.980]  You know? And he was like, yeah, for sure. So we just took some Lactobacillus serum. You spray
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:06.380]  that for three days and it's completely gone because beneficial fungi overtakes bad fungi.
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:12.060]  That's a whole lie. That's like a farmer's tale about PM being systematic and stuff like that.
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:16.380]  It's definitely not systematic. He went through his whole flower period and had no PM whatsoever.
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:17.420]  Nice. Very nice.
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:19.500]  Plants.
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:22.620]  PM can be a real bitch sometimes in Colorado when the temperature changes here.
[01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:23.020]  Oh, yeah.
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:24.140]  And it changes every day.
[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:25.420]  I've had to cut down rooms.
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:26.380]  I had to just eat yesterday and snow today.
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:29.340]  That's what I was about to say. Yesterday you were wearing shorts and I was like,
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:32.780]  it's too warm. I wish I had on shorts and a t-shirt. And now today I woke up and I was like,
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:33.740]  it's cold. What happened?
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:33.980]  Yeah.
[01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:34.860]  What is going on?
[01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:35.980]  And it's snowing and shit.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:40.540]  I've been hoping on Friday, a little brag here. I get to go see Joe Rogan at Comedy Works Friday.
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:44.140]  And I was just hoping don't snow until Saturday. Don't snow until Saturday. It's all I was hoping
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:47.980]  for. And it fucking got me on Thursday. Like jinxed myself. Damn it, Joe Rogan.
[01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:53.340]  Oh, well, it'll be a good time. Shout out to Comedy Works. Shout out to Baker. I cannot wait.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:54.220]  That's going to be fun.
[01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:58.460]  Yeah. I'm so stoked. I go to a lot of comedy shows and Joe Rogan is probably
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:01.180]  one of the few that like really get me super pumped. You know,
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:04.460]  I have to go to as many as I go to. It's like, yeah, I'm going to a show, but now I'm like,
[01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:11.900]  yeah, yeah. Rogan and Joey Diaz. And there's a few of them. I got lucky enough to see Diaz also.
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:16.780]  Yeah. That was rad. All right. Let's see how long we've been going. 26 minutes. I'll talk more.
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:21.900]  So it seems like you guys both follow the TLO book quite a bit as a good way to get started.
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:23.820]  Would you recommend the TLO book from the red?
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:24.220]  Definitely.
[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:25.100]  Is that all right?
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:25.820]  100%.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:28.060]  Yeah. All right. Have you ever gotten any of his seeds?
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:28.860]  I have not.
[01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:31.340]  It seems like he puts out some good seeds. I haven't grown any of them yet,
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:34.140]  but I've got a pack somewhere that I should grow. I guess.
[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:36.620]  I mean, I'm sure he's, I mean, I'm sure he's grown five.
[01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:40.060]  Oh yeah. He's been doing it for so long that he better have the fire by now.
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:45.820]  Yeah. Shout out to the Rev. They made him change his Facebook page to his real name. So that's
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:49.180]  weird. Yeah. It's really weird seeing all these people's real names. Shout out to the Rev. Check
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:51.020]  out the TLO book, true living organics.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:51.900]  Yes. The truth.
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:55.180]  What's the other book that he did that I did not write down the name of?
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:59.340]  Okay. Everybody went blank. Anyway, the Rev check out his cannabis books. Great.
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:01.420]  And then there's some other ones. What does it teaming with?
[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:04.460]  Teaming with microbes. That's the book I'm trying to think of. Is that the Rev also?
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:08.620]  No, that's not the Rev. That's just some, uh, it's not even about cannabis at all.
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:09.820]  They're just about, uh,
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:10.620]  Soil food web.
[01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:11.900]  Yeah. It's all about the soil food web.
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:14.620]  All right. Well, check out teaming with microbes. That's a great book.
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:16.460]  Oh, that's the best. That's the best. Yeah.
[01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:20.140]  It'll teach you how to keep your soil food web rocking.
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:25.260]  Read TLO first. Cause teaming with microbes is a little bit
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:28.380]  overwhelming. It's not really beginner information you need to have. You need to
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:33.500]  have kind of an idea of what's going on to, or it'll just go right over your head. Otherwise
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:40.860]  it skips a lot of Google, all the basics. Exactly. Exactly. So read TLO. TLO is a great one. And then
[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:44.220]  once you get a good handle on that, you think you have an understanding of like
[01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:49.420]  how organics work and you know, you want to dive a little deeper, open up teaming with microbes and
[01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:53.740]  learn about the soil food web. Cause that's where, that's where no-till really comes into play.
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:57.820]  Um, the soil food web, cause that's what's happening inside of your soil is you've got a
[01:47:57.820 --> 01:48:06.460]  whole ecosystem of microorganisms living, breeding, excreting, you know, feeding your plants. Uh,
[01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:08.860]  so yeah, definitely, definitely check both of those out.
[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:11.180]  Any other books you two would recommend while you're talking about books?
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:15.500]  Um, teaming with nutrients is pretty good. It's a little bit less about organics. It's
[01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:19.260]  the same guys that did teaming with microbes. I've skimmed through that. We have it at work.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:25.340]  I've skimmed through it a couple of times. Um, it's just more, yes, it's less organic based,
[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:28.700]  but if you're, if you don't want to do the full organic ride, which I understand some people don't
[01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:32.540]  want to do it, check it out. It'll, it'll kind of give you a good, a little bit better understanding
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:37.420]  of what's going on in your soil with your nutrients and bottle feeding and stuff.
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:38.780]  Okay. So it's pretty cool.
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:42.860]  You guys ever get any of your, uh, no-till products tested by any of the labs?
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:50.220]  Um, I haven't yet, but, um, I want to really soon. I think me and my buddy were going to go
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:55.100]  up to Springs to, uh, what is it? Uh, CB1 analytics or something.
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:56.620]  CB1, shout out Nate.
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:57.020]  Yeah.
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:48:59.020]  There we go. Are they reputable? Would you give them a name?
[01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:00.300]  Oh yeah. CB1, shout out Nate.
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:02.940]  In Colorado Springs, huh? I didn't know there was a testing facility available.
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:07.020]  I don't know if they do like the pesticides or not though. I wanted them to do a full analysis
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:11.260]  just so I could just show how food grade our cannabis is, that we don't spray no pesticides.
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:16.220]  We don't use no bullshit. You know, we don't use bottles. There's no heavy metals. Like you
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:19.900]  could test it, you know, all the way down and it's just going to be a pure cannabis.
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:25.820]  Right. Okay. Well, I'd love to see the tests. I want to see what kind of THC, CBD, CBG,
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:29.100]  CBN. You know what I mean? I want to see all that stuff. What's coming out on the no-till.
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:33.180]  Just curious. I just smoked and saw your product. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm high as shit from
[01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:36.060]  smoking some of Frosty's Frosty Gorilla Glue 4.
[01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:36.940]  Thank you.
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:42.860]  The trichomes were really short and all over the place. It didn't look like they got really tall.
[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:44.620]  It looked like they were fighting for space in there.
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:50.140]  Yeah. I guess that's just me. You know, the way I feed my plants and stuff like that.
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:53.340]  Nothing. I'm just saying it was, it was frosty. They were fighting for space in there.
[01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:53.900]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:56.860]  I got good, good and good and heavily medicated on there.
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:57.260]  Thank you.
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:04.700]  Can we talk about where people can acquire some of your great smokables? Is that something you're
[01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:07.980]  like you want to mention on the show? If not, I could totally hit a little bit of
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:09.580]  editing and take this part right out.
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:12.140]  No, for sure. At the Canna Canyon.
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:16.060]  Yeah. Shout out to our friends at the Canna Canyon in beautiful Colorado Springs.
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:19.180]  Yeah. I carry a lot of my product over there. I guess you could say,
[01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:24.220]  you know, I'm kind of a co-op grower for them and stuff like that. They carry my product there. So,
[01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:29.500]  if you are a member there, you can go reimburse my product there. But, you know, in the streets
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:32.860]  and stuff like that, you know, personally, you know, that's not my thing and stuff like that.
[01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:34.540]  The Canyon is what I was shooting for.
[01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:34.940]  Exactly.
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:39.500]  Yeah. People from anywhere, if you're 21 and over, you're able to come to the Canna Canyon
[01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:43.500]  in Colorado Springs. It's on Colorado Boulevard. I cannot think of the exact address. It's like
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:48.620]  1505, I think. 1507. Yeah. Will's going to search for me while I ramble on. But come to the Canna
[01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:52.300]  Canyon in Colorado Springs. If you're 21 and over, if you've got a valid ID and you're not an
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:58.220]  asshole, we invite you to come to the Canna Canyon. Please sign up. Join as a member. Sign
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:50:59.740]  the member agreement. You got the address, bro?
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:02.540]  Yeah. It's 1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:08.300]  Yeah. I nailed it. 1507 West Colorado Avenue in beautiful Colorado Springs. Parking in the front
[01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:13.020]  is kind of a bitch, but parking in the back is available. Go into the alley. You got to park
[01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:17.260]  like kind of diagonal in there. You'll see it. Do it. It's near the 7-Eleven. If you see the 7-Eleven,
[01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:22.220]  go across the street. You're close. But come in there. Be 21. Don't be a dick. Have an ID. Sign
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:27.260]  the member agreement. Join. Come in. Hang out. Take a couple dabs. Smoke with us. Chances are,
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:32.060]  I might be there. Deb and Granny might be there. Will might be there. Frosty could be there. I
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:35.260]  don't know. You're only in town for a few days, but shoot. By the time this episode comes out,
[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:38.860]  hey, my new friend Logan could be there. You never know. I'm there taking dabs. The traveling
[01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:43.100]  stoner is there all the damn time. Camille is there all the time. You can see the dogs,
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:48.860]  but you can also grab some flowers that were done by our good friend Frosty here that are totally
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:52.140]  organic, that are beautiful, that are gorgeous. Last time I was there, I think they had some of
[01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:55.260]  the Gorilla Glue on the shelf. It's beautiful. It's a crowd favorite.
[01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:56.380]  Doesn't stay long.
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:57.980]  No, it doesn't. It does not.
[01:51:57.980 --> 01:51:58.700]  Not the glue.
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:03.180]  They get busy when some stuff comes around. That was a huge shout out to the Cannon Cannon. You
[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:04.940]  guys can write the checkout to Rasta Jeff.
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:10.220]  Just to plug myself, you can also find my extracts on the shelves there too.
[01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:14.620]  Yes, you can. I was going to give you a shout out for that. It said on the little parchment paper
[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:18.780]  that it was 27 point something grams when you dropped it off is what it looked like. Bro,
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:23.340]  it was nowhere near 27 grams. You can pick that shit up. It looks like it was popular.
[01:52:23.340 --> 01:52:27.980]  Yeah. They've been telling me it's been selling pretty quickly. They're happy with it. I'm happy
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:28.220]  with that.
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:31.740]  It's a good product. It's been being reimbursed for quickly.
[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:31.900]  Yeah.
[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:35.340]  I don't know what you said. I don't know what you said, but yeah, that's something,
[01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:41.660]  if you do go to the club, the Cannon Canyon or any of the clubs, learn the lingo. Please
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:47.020]  say the proper shit. Use the proper terminology, nomenclature, whatever you got to do. Reimburse
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:50.540]  however it goes there. Make sure you do that. I know sometimes it feels silly,
[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:55.340]  but that's the way it works. I think we've covered most of No-Till and it sounds like
[01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:59.260]  this is a perfect segue into something else that I wanted to talk about. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:07.100]  in Denver, Colorado, they voted yes to allow consumption of cannabis in adult places.
[01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:14.460]  Some bars and clubs will begin allowing people to smoke cannabis in certain sections
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:19.580]  indoors in places. That means we're going to have social lounges in Denver very soon.
[01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:24.380]  I'm sure that people are looking for buildings to rent right now. There are already places that
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:30.060]  function illegitimately, under the radar. Those places are probably going to blow up and be
[01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:34.620]  popular. Or there are people out there right now looking for property, painting the walls,
[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:39.260]  getting shit set up, stockpiling product. There's one up there. I'm not going to say
[01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:41.900]  who it is, but I've been there a couple of times and it's just...
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:46.060]  I've been to a couple, just like Springs. I've been to a couple that are really nice. The
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:51.180]  Cannon Canyon, the couches, they went to a nice place and bought brand new couches.
[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:55.740]  They bought a rug that matched, that went with the paint on the walls. They got a table with
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:59.740]  end tables that all match. They got a shelf that's the same kind of wood as the tables.
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:06.140]  It looks like somebody really, they had their gay interior decorator friend came and helped him out.
[01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:09.980]  There's a competitor that's very near there that looks like they got all of their shit at the
[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:16.060]  thrift store down the street and their fucking dog laid on it for six weeks. I honestly won't
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:18.860]  let my dreadlocks touch that couch. You can do it, Fox. You're talking about it.
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:20.140]  I think I've seen it on Instagram.
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:24.540]  I won't let my dreads down in there. I keep my dreads tied up. I won't let my backpack out of
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:28.860]  my sight in there. At the Cannon Canyon, I'll go take a piss and leave my backpack and my rig and
[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:33.260]  my hash on the table because that's crew in there. That's family. It's the homie place.
[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:38.860]  There are other places that are in the middle and above and below that. There are some where
[01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:43.260]  I won't even take my backpack in because I feel like I might get jacked for it. There are some
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:47.180]  that are so damn loud because the band is playing constantly that I can't even be there.
[01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:52.860]  Just some of the all. Yeah, that's funny. But we're going to be able to have clubs. I hope
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:57.020]  somebody does it right. I hope somebody does. There's got I mean, someone's going to it's
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:00.380]  going to be sweet. Yeah, there's going to be some cool places. I got I got them. They don't
[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:04.140]  all have to be reggae lounges. You guys, they don't all have to be dubstep bars.
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:08.620]  Like it'd be cool if Chiba was like if they let one of their places if they turn on their
[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:12.220]  plans. Smoking friendly. How cool would that be? You know? Yeah. Find out both of them. But if they
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:17.100]  did the Colfax one, maybe how about like a smoking night at a bowling alley? Oh, right.
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:21.660]  See that like opens up all these. That's so cool. Yeah. I wonder if you need to get if it's a permit
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:25.260]  or a special license you'll need to get. Whatever is one of those things you can be like, hey,
[01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:31.820]  can we get a permit for Saturday night so we can allow smoking? Or is it just like a and hypothetical
[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:35.900]  now, you guys, this is all shit that is going to come up. And this is stuff. OK, I preach this all
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:39.260]  the time when you're writing rules in your area, write this shit in so that we don't have to sit
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:43.660]  here and make it up right now, because if you don't write these rules in your rulemaking, old
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:47.420]  people in suits that don't give a fuck about cannabis, that don't take dabs, that don't go out
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:51.980]  are going to write these rules. That's going to suck. It's so maybe you can get like like you get
[01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:55.820]  a liquor license. That's what I was thinking. Just pay for a year of cannabis consumption
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:56:01.260]  license so that every night after nine p.m. you can consume cannabis in your facility or whatever.
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:06.140]  Yeah. From nine to two, nine to three. Then that way, when they had to, when you got all the
[01:56:06.140 --> 01:56:10.060]  drinks, you take some dabs and hang out and socialize. I mean, nobody ever gets in a fight
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:16.540]  ever. He's got something to say. Pass him a mic. Well, my my thought, too, is what about like if
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:21.100]  you bring your own like dabs to these places, is that going to be allowed? That's basically the
[01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:24.940]  way it's going to work with our marijuana enforcement division system. That's mostly
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:29.580]  the way it's going to have to work is to bring your own cannabis system. OK, I'm sure they'll
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:33.420]  cut the loop, the loophole out of that one pretty quickly because they've seen how it worked.
[01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:37.340]  They've seen how it works down in Colorado Springs with the loopholes. So I feel like
[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:41.980]  they'll probably make it so it's like, all right, there's no reimbursement. This is not a co-op.
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:47.820]  This is you can bring. I think they'll make it pretty clear that it's like there will be no money
[01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:53.020]  handed to anybody for anything. But they'll have to have, you know what I'd love to have it. They
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:57.580]  call it a barcade is the theme. You go to the bars, you get drinks and play video games. I don't drink.
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:02.060]  So I just stand there like I like Supernova in Springs. So I just kind of stand there like,
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:05.900]  this is fun. I can play some Street Fighter and all you fucking drunks are spilling beer on me.
[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:12.540]  And like, honestly, I would like a beer, but unfortunately, I don't know how to have a beer.
[01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:17.340]  I like to have about 20 or 30 beers. So I just don't drink at all. It's a lot better for me
[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:21.180]  because I'll have a beer and then somebody be like, you want a shot? And yes, I do want a shot.
[01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:24.700]  And then do you want another shot? Yes, I do. And now I don't know where the fuck I am or where my
[01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:30.220]  money or my car is. And I drink a lot of shots and there's no, there's just no line for me. So I
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:34.220]  choose not to drink at all, but I could smoke like the best of them. So I wish that while all
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:38.860]  my friends are at Supernova drinking and doing shots, have a fat joint in my hand and play some
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:46.620]  Street Fighter two, man, throw some Sonic booms and be up there playing some Tekken and slaying
[01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:52.620]  it all night. It'd be fun. So somebody open up a, so that would be the way to have some video
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:57.180]  games, maybe some laser tag in there. Cause even like I said, this opens up, you know,
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:01.260]  yeah, the, the ganja gourmet can go back to their original format. Now you used to be able
[01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:04.780]  to go smoke at the ganja gourmet. Oh, that'd be awesome. You just go get some really good food,
[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:11.340]  super heady food and smoke. That would also like bring OSHA in there. Like if I are just with
[01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:16.940]  smoking, you know, cause smoke is like banned, like I think nationwide. Yeah. It's a, it's state
[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:20.860]  to state or County to County. There's the clean air act. So you're not supposed to be able to
[01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:25.100]  smoke in places. But if that's why I was saying you could get that yearly liquor license, that
[01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:30.620]  cannabis consumption license, it would probably break that, give you that rule override somehow.
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:35.260]  Your card. And I'm sure like, again, like once the taboo is just broken down, like,
[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:38.540]  like in these restaurants and places, you know, people just aren't going to care.
[01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:44.060]  Imagine like by the third or fourth cannabis night at the bowling alley bowl night at the bowling
[01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:48.700]  alley, they're going to be like, dude, this snack bar fucking crushed. We've never sold so many
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:55.260]  nachos ever. Let's do this all the time. Everybody was peaceful. Like there were a couple of dudes
[01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:59.580]  who just stood there. They paid for their bowling shoes. They fucking stood there and stared at the
[01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:07.420]  lane moving. They didn't do anything. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I see in my mind too. I used to be the
[01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:10.940]  manager of bowling alley. They used to do the black light bowling. So I could see it all in my
[01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:15.580]  mind. If we could have just smoked in there. Oh my God. Everything would have been better. We had so
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:20.860]  many fights in there because we served tons of alcohol and you turn on music and you got music,
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:25.740]  girls and alcohol. And that's the three things that eventually add to a fight. And there are
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:30.780]  dudes bowling. So like, bro, I got a strike raw guys next to him, got a gutter ball. And now
[01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:34.700]  they're like, Oh yeah, fuck you. And that's why they're going to fight. I saw it fucking once a
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:40.220]  week in a bowling alley. Yeah. Just take a dab, bro. Take a day. You know, you're trying to fight.
[01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:45.420]  Hit this. Where's the, where's they pass out and problem solved there anyway, right? Yeah. Why was
[01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:52.060]  I trying to fight you again, dude? No, hi. You've got good weed, bro. We need to be friends.
[01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:58.220]  We just become best friends. Oh, I love that. We had a really serious lesson on no till. And then
[01:59:58.220 --> 02:00:02.780]  we turned it into whole chatter, which is awesome. The people like it. Uh, people that are from other
[02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:06.060]  States like yourself that don't get to be here and involved in this kind of love to hear us
[02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:09.260]  chatter about what it's like to be here. They do like, I get messages like, bro, it's like hanging
[02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:13.100]  out with you. It's like freedom for some people. I used to listen to the podcast back when I lived
[02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:15.500]  in North Carolina. I do remember it kind of being like that. Sometimes I was like, man,
[02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:18.700]  it sounds like it's cool over there. Yeah. Yeah. And you're like, when I was in Maddie and Spence,
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:21.740]  which come on the show and I was just like, well, I just shout out to Maddie and Spence. It's good
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:25.260]  to see those kids doing well. That's how I met you guys. If it weren't for Maddie and Spence,
[02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:31.020]  I wouldn't know either one of you. That's how I met you. I miss those guys. And now we're all
[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:35.020]  growing the same genetics. I feel like everybody that I know for the most part I've met either
[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:39.340]  through that I haven't met through work. I've met through them or through somebody I met through
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:44.060]  them. Where are you from Frosty? I'm from Oklahoma, Oklahoma. Okay. I never knew that,
[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:49.260]  bro. I assumed you were from North Carolina just because everybody else was from North Carolina.
[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:54.060]  No, I actually, uh, you know, met Spence a long time ago whenever, uh, you know,
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:58.780]  the greener side was still open and all that. Shout out to Hanky B. Yeah. Um, I actually met
[02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:03.420]  him through Hank and stuff like that, you know? So I've known Spencer for, uh, you know, quite
[02:01:03.420 --> 02:01:09.980]  some time. Yeah. Good kids. Yeah. Gardner Whedon crew. Oh yeah. Yeah. Hanky B. Uh, he posts pics of
[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:13.820]  that little kid, dude. I get tired of seeing people's kids on Instagram and on Facebook,
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:19.100]  but God damn Hank. Son's a handsome little G that dude's going to be a pimp, bro. Ladies and
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:23.660]  gentlemen, hide your fucking daughter because Hank's kid Lucas is coming to get her. He's
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:27.900]  coming to get them. Yeah, bro. He is a pimp. He's a baller. He's a handsome little devil.
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:33.100]  Yeah. He dresses and looks just like daddy. Yeah. He's a little micro pimp. He's on it.
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:37.020]  That's awesome. Yeah. You guys got, uh, anything else that you want to say on a podcast since
[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:42.540]  you've got a whole lot of people listening to you? Go organic. Yeah. Go organic. Go Motel.
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:47.020]  If you want to smoke, uh, you know, the, the terpeous, you know, the tastiest, uh,
[02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:52.620]  smoothest, cleanest cannabis that, uh, you can consume, you know, go organic.
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:56.780]  If you're trying to heal somebody, if you're trying to get rid of cancer, or if you're trying
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:02:01.900]  to take care of people that have conditions like Crohn's disease, Crohn's disease, or possibly
[02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:05.740]  an autoimmune disease or anything that you're trying to take care of, you don't want to give
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:11.260]  people shit medicine. You want to give them quality medicine that is actually medicine.
[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:14.780]  Exactly. If they want to take shit into their bodies, they just go get pharmaceuticals.
[02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:19.580]  They'd go to the pharmacy and get some pills and get some poison. Please. Let's not poison people.
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:23.820]  Let's not spray stupid shit on our plants. If you're growing with bottles, I'm not hating on
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:28.460]  you. I grow with bottles. You guys, I like to use Botanic Care Pure Blend Pro. I use Veg Bloom.
[02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:34.060]  I've done plenty of that organic as fuck stuff. My lifestyle and the way that I learned how to grow,
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:37.500]  I'm really comfortable with the bottles. These guys kind of inspire me to step outside the box.
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:41.660]  You may see me do some, uh, some attempts at some no-till stuff, but we're not hating on you.
[02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:47.340]  If you are growing with bottles, do me one favor and flush, flush heavily for at least 10 to 14
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:52.540]  days. I think 20 days. If you've got a longer strain, go ahead, flush for 20 days. If your
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:55.820]  leaves start looking a little bit yellow, you're doing it right. Don't get mad at some yellow
[02:02:55.820 --> 02:03:00.540]  leaves at the end. That means the plant is using up the nutrients that it needed, and it is now
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:04.860]  time to come down. Look outside when it's fall time. What happens? The leaves change colors and
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:09.420]  they come off. Your plant is saying, it's fall time, bro. It's the end. I want to be done. It's
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:13.260]  when you should cut it down and take care of it. All right. That's what I think. Sorry about that.
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:16.140]  Chris Bounds I have just one more thing I was going to say.
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:21.100]  To anybody that is like, hasn't started, I meant to say this in the last one. Anybody that hasn't
[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:26.060]  started growing yet, and if you want to get into growing and you think you eventually do want to
[02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:31.900]  get into organics and you think it might be smarter to learn with bottles first, I would
[02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:36.620]  advise you just go ahead and jump straight into organics because it's two totally different things.
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:41.660]  You'll learn how to grow with nutrients and be like, okay, cool. I'm going to switch to organics.
[02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:45.260]  And it's entirely different. You start from scratch.
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:47.260]  Chris Stern You have to buy so much different shit.
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:51.900]  Yeah. It's so much different. So if you know you want to do organics,
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:54.140]  just go from the get go. Chris Bounds
[02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:58.860]  Just go no-till because in my opinion, it sounds like no-till, it's going to cost you a little bit
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:02.860]  more to get started. But you're going to have to buy worms. You're going to need worm castings.
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:06.940]  You're going to need amendments. You're going to need modern mix 2.0. You're going to need to get
[02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:12.460]  a headstart on yourself. But I think if you're buying something like advanced nutrients or mills
[02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:12.540]  or cycle- Chris Bounds
[02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:14.540]  You're buying bottles every week, bottles every month. And that adds up real quick.
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:20.300]  Yeah. So just get yourself some no-till and you're ready to go. You only have to buy it
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:25.100]  once. After that first harvest, you've paid for that. Even if richer and richer and richer.
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:27.740]  Yeah. Round 30 is going to be the best round you've had.
[02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:31.020]  Oh man. So it's going to get better and better and better.
[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:41.500]  And better and better. You just got to think it's going to be like the forest or like the
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:45.660]  rainforest. The biggest plants in the world are in the rainforest. It has the richest soil in the
[02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:49.980]  world. So basically your soil is going to be mimicking the rainforest.
[02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:52.780]  Yeah. It's undisturbed out there. Nothing fucks with it except nature.
[02:04:52.780 --> 02:04:54.140]  So much humus in there too.
[02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:57.420]  Things die and things decompose. Go ahead, bro.
[02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:03.580]  Definitely with compost on top of just any style of growing anything. If you just recycle all
[02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:09.820]  vegetables and stuff and even bits of food, you can really get those worms eating and fatter and
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:14.380]  healthier. It all just feeds itself. It turns itself.
[02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:17.580]  Will there ever be a point when I have too many worms in my pot?
[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:18.380]  No. No.
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:20.220]  Because it's just self-sustaining.
[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:24.540]  Yeah. They regulate themselves. They multiply relatively quickly. You'd be surprised at how
[02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:32.300]  fast you get a good bit. But they also regulate. They know there's only X amount of space. Plus,
[02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:34.700]  I don't really know the lifespan on a worm, but I can't imagine.
[02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:36.460]  Yeah. Some of them die off and stuff like that.
[02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:37.260]  Of course. Yeah.
[02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:39.900]  Then they decay and they become part of the humus.
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:42.860]  Yeah. They have nutrients in them though, so that's good for you.
[02:05:42.860 --> 02:05:43.340]  Yeah.
[02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:49.260]  Okay. In TLO, I think the Rev actually gives a nice little setup on how to make a worm farm so
[02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:54.140]  that you can make your own worm castings from the worms as well. So you can get that going. You can
[02:05:54.140 --> 02:06:00.140]  be fully sustainable. Do the worm castings in your garage because it does stink a little bit.
[02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:00.700]  Don't do that one.
[02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:03.900]  And you got to feed it compost. It's mostly what you put in and it's going to stink.
[02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:04.140]  Yeah.
[02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:08.700]  And I'm a vegetarian, so I'm throwing in avocado peels and apple cores and
[02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:13.580]  the tips of the strawberries and all that. It's going to be super rich though. It's
[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:14.620]  super rich in nutrients. I'm sure.
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:19.100]  Yeah. My plants loved it when I was feeding them that type of stuff. They were sweet and sticky.
[02:06:19.100 --> 02:06:19.820]  Yeah.
[02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:20.300]  Excellent.
[02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:20.860]  Nice.
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:24.620]  All right. Man, I shouldn't even tell you how many people listened, but within 24 hours of
[02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:28.780]  releasing this episode, about 5,000 people will download and listen to this between iTunes,
[02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:33.180]  Stitcher, and my website. Plus, I'm available on seven or eight other podcasting applications
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:36.460]  that I don't even pay any attention to. So a lot of people are going to hear this,
[02:06:36.460 --> 02:06:38.460]  so I appreciate you guys coming and helping out the growers.
[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:41.020]  Hey man, we appreciate you having us. Appreciate it.
[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:44.700]  Glad to get you guys on. People love to hear this type of stuff. This is definitely information
[02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:49.100]  people need to know because this is sustainable. I always talk about end of the world scenario.
[02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:53.020]  You guys are going to grow. I'm going to be at rating hydro shops. Going to need the last bit
[02:06:53.020 --> 02:06:55.180]  of the bottles because it's all going to the end.
[02:06:55.180 --> 02:06:58.380]  Yeah. And you can do this with... No-till will work with a lot of other... I mean,
[02:06:58.380 --> 02:07:01.340]  it's not just weed. You can do no-till with basically anything. You'll have to do top
[02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:05.180]  doesn't amend it a little bit differently depending on what you do, but it's good. Yeah.
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:09.340]  Like you said, end of the world. Oh no. No-till, you've got a sustainable garden out front. You've
[02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:11.180]  got everything you need. You guys will be growing weed.
[02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:12.220]  Yep. Yep.
[02:07:12.220 --> 02:07:17.820]  I'll be making a raft out of bottles. All right, Frosty, remind everybody how they can stalk you
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:19.980]  on social media so they can check you out and give you a follow.

[02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:43.100]  Logan grabbing the mic.

[02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:53.100]  I'm on a tour all across North America and I'm actually going to Mexico in December.
[02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:55.500]  I like whitewater kayaking and wire wrapping.
[02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:56.620]  Excellent.
[02:07:56.620 --> 02:07:57.580]  Give me the follow.
[02:07:57.580 --> 02:08:01.100]  Yeah, dude. My listeners will love all of that shit. They're a bunch of looks,
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:03.660]  so they're going to love the wire wraps. They're going to want to see you go kayaking.
[02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:05.020]  He kills it with the wire wraps. He does.
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:05.820]  You make your own?

[02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:36.700]  in your cubicle getting some shit done. I hope you're at the warehouse getting some shit done
[02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:41.500]  to this extended episode. Thank you for listening. I want to thank everybody for joining me. Big
[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:44.780]  shout out to Maddie and Spence out there on the farm, on the mountain, out there on the coast.

[02:14:21.870 --> 02:14:26.190]  Welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 168 of the Grow From Your Heart
[02:14:26.190 --> 02:14:31.390]  podcast. Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right. If you're a new
[02:14:31.390 --> 02:14:35.070]  grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[02:14:35.070 --> 02:14:38.670]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of
[02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:44.350]  cannabis, this my friend is the podcast for you. I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I
[02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:48.110]  want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout
[02:14:48.110 --> 02:14:52.110]  out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[02:14:52.110 --> 02:14:58.030]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew. I hope everybody's having a great day
[02:14:58.030 --> 02:15:01.870]  while they're listening. I did not put out a Thursday episode. I apologize, guys. It was
[02:15:01.870 --> 02:15:06.190]  Thanksgiving. I wanted to hang out for a week. I'm actually recording the day after Thanksgiving.
[02:15:06.190 --> 02:15:09.550]  I hope everybody had a good holiday. I hope everybody survived Black Friday.
[02:15:10.830 --> 02:15:13.950]  Maybe you boycotted Black Friday. Whatever you did, I hope it went well for you.
[02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:21.550]  You guys, I'm hanging out. Just about 45 minutes ago, I ate a Schumett banana pudding bar made with
[02:15:21.550 --> 02:15:28.030]  200 milligrams of THC distillate. It says, caution, it contains medical marijuana for medical use
[02:15:28.030 --> 02:15:33.230]  only. Keep out of reach of children. I could see why, you guys. About 40 minutes ago, my life was
[02:15:33.230 --> 02:15:37.230]  different. I'm getting high as shit from this thing. I decided I better get down on this recording
[02:15:37.230 --> 02:15:40.670]  and get it done before things get wonky in my world. Big shout out to our friends at Schumett
[02:15:40.670 --> 02:15:45.710]  Bars. I endorse the banana pudding bar. It's delicious. Go get yourself one. Check it out
[02:15:45.710 --> 02:15:49.230]  at your local dispensary. All right, you guys. Speaking of shout outs, big shout out to our
[02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:53.230]  friends at thedankteam.com. If you need regular or feminized seats, make sure you support our
[02:15:53.230 --> 02:15:58.670]  friends at thedankteam.com. Let me try that again. Thedankteam.com. There we go. That was
[02:15:58.670 --> 02:16:02.910]  English. Thedankteam.com. They've got brands like Archive Seed Bank. They have got Mile High,
[02:16:02.910 --> 02:16:06.990]  Canaventure. They've of course got iReed Genetics. They've got Rare Dankness.
[02:16:07.870 --> 02:16:11.790]  They've got everybody you can think of. They've now got Brothers Grim Seeds, which is a great
[02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:17.470]  thing. Big shout out to Brothers Grim and the C99. Make sure you check out thedankteam.com.
[02:16:17.470 --> 02:16:21.390]  Let's see. Who else do I need to give a shout out to? No more shout outs. Since we're talking about
[02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:27.550]  seeds, let's talk about my recent breeding project, you guys. It has been time. Yesterday,
[02:16:27.550 --> 02:16:31.390]  I checked the male plants. I checked the female plants and they were speaking at me, bro. They
[02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:36.270]  were like, it is time. Let's sprinkle some pollen. Anybody that's been paying attention to the show
[02:16:36.270 --> 02:16:40.430]  knows that I've been running a breeding project continuously. I've always got some breeding going,
[02:16:40.430 --> 02:16:45.550]  but right now I've got a male Arise plant and I've got some female plants. What's in there? I have
[02:16:45.550 --> 02:16:50.430]  got a Grateful Dog female. There's a Lemon Jeffrey female. There are several Cookies and Cream
[02:16:50.430 --> 02:16:55.550]  females. What else is in there? There's White Widow. There are some other things in there.
[02:16:55.550 --> 02:16:59.710]  There are also Arises in there, so I can make some Arise F2 seeds. There's a bunch of stuff
[02:16:59.710 --> 02:17:06.110]  in the room. Yesterday, the male plants are huge. There are male colas the length of my arms on
[02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:10.750]  these male plants. Pollen is just falling out. If you breathe too heavily, pollen goes flying
[02:17:10.750 --> 02:17:14.750]  across the room. I didn't want to drag the whole plant across the room to where the females were,
[02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:20.350]  so I cut off a few select branches that were quite large, carried them over to the female plants,
[02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:25.470]  all those male plants a nice shake. There was a huge cloud of pollen in my grow room for quite a
[02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:30.350]  while. I taste like pollen. Everything tastes like pollen around me. My whole mouth was just
[02:17:30.350 --> 02:17:34.990]  coated in pollen. I had to take a fat shower, had to clean everything up. There was a lot of pollen
[02:17:34.990 --> 02:17:39.790]  in the air. In about 50, 60-ish days, we're going to have some new seeds, some new creations.
[02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:44.990]  It's going to be some great stuff happening. I'm excited for that. Let's see. What else can I talk
[02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:48.350]  about? We talked about that. I'm just making, I've got a checklist, you guys, because I get stupid
[02:17:48.350 --> 02:17:51.630]  high and forget to talk about shit and then talk about shit that doesn't even matter instead.
[02:17:52.830 --> 02:17:56.830]  Let's see. What did I do? I want to brag. A couple of days ago on Friday night,
[02:17:57.870 --> 02:18:03.070]  I got to take my lovely date, Jenny Beth, to Comedy Works to go see, Joe Rugan was the headliner.
[02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:06.910]  There was a comedian named Jaron Horton that opened. That dude was fucking hilarious, you guys.
[02:18:06.910 --> 02:18:11.230]  I'd never heard of or seen him before. When he came on stage, he walked in, made a presence,
[02:18:11.230 --> 02:18:16.270]  and he crushed for 30 or 40 solid minutes. Then he wound down and he looked at the crowd,
[02:18:16.270 --> 02:18:20.910]  and he was like, I think I'm done. He said, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Rugan. Joe Rugan came out
[02:18:21.550 --> 02:18:26.510]  and crushed, you guys. Joe Rugan just did his new comedy special for the year. When a comedian
[02:18:26.510 --> 02:18:30.990]  records their special, the way they do it, they record that special and they throw away that
[02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:35.550]  material. Once your comedy special comes out on Comedy Central or Netflix or wherever it goes,
[02:18:35.550 --> 02:18:39.790]  CISO seems to be the new shit. Once your comedy special comes out, you throw away that material.
[02:18:39.790 --> 02:18:44.430]  You don't perform that anymore, and you work on your next hour. Then at the end of the year,
[02:18:44.430 --> 02:18:49.150]  you want to put out your whole new special of our material, then you do that all over again.
[02:18:49.150 --> 02:18:53.630]  That keeps the comedian on his toes. Rugan just put out a special. He's only had a couple of
[02:18:53.630 --> 02:18:58.750]  months to work up new shit, maybe a month. He was here doing new shit. He went for an hour and a
[02:18:58.750 --> 02:19:03.390]  half. About 45 to an hour into the show, he looked up at the crowd with this look, and he goes,
[02:19:03.390 --> 02:19:06.830]  I just ran out of shit about three minutes ago. I don't have any more material. He just started
[02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:11.870]  making shit up on the fly and joking. He still crushed it. He did a little bit of crowd work,
[02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:16.510]  but he destroyed for a comedian. I love Joe Rogan's style. I love the way he does comedy.
[02:19:16.510 --> 02:19:22.030]  I agree with 97% of what he says. That's always a great show. Joe does his show. He wraps up.
[02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:28.030]  We're giving him a standing ovation. He walks off the stage, and less than 40 seconds later,
[02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:32.990]  he comes running back on stage. It had to be 15, 20 seconds later. He ran back on stage,
[02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:37.070]  and he grabs a microphone, and he said, sit the fuck down. Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:42.750]  Dave Chappelle is here. He said, you guys, Dave Chappelle is here. Me and my date looked at each
[02:19:42.750 --> 02:19:48.110]  other like, what? That's probably one of our favorite comedians, both of us. I've never seen
[02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:52.750]  Dave Chappelle. She's never seen Rogan or Chappelle. I've seen Rogan before, but for Chappelle to walk
[02:19:52.750 --> 02:19:59.550]  out was awesome. Chappelle was fucked up, you guys. Chappelle was intoxicated. Luckily, since
[02:19:59.550 --> 02:20:04.510]  I've got some friends at Comedy Works, I happen to be front row. As you walk out onto the stage,
[02:20:04.510 --> 02:20:08.350]  there are a couple seats actually on the stage, but then if you go a few more feet,
[02:20:09.150 --> 02:20:13.550]  those next two seats that are in the crowd are where I was sitting and where Jenny Beth was
[02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:18.430]  sitting. Chappelle just was fucked up. He just walked out barely onto the stage. He was on the
[02:20:18.430 --> 02:20:23.150]  stage, and he stood directly in front of her and I and told jokes for about 30 minutes,
[02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:29.550]  and Shane smoked cigarettes and drank Corona beers. He did 40 solid minutes of grab-and-buy-the-pussy
[02:20:29.550 --> 02:20:33.390]  jokes and material about Trump and the election. He did some Dave Chappelle jokes. He did a little
[02:20:33.390 --> 02:20:38.910]  bit of weed jokes, but mostly grab-and-buy-the-pussy jokes for like 40 minutes by Dave Chappelle.
[02:20:38.910 --> 02:20:42.670]  It was hilarious. Big shout out to Jenny Beth for going with me. She was an incredible date.
[02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:45.630]  We've been having a lot of fun with her lately, so big shout out. That was a great time. Glad
[02:20:45.630 --> 02:20:49.550]  she was able to come. Had to get her off work a little bit early for that, and glad it worked out.
[02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:53.470]  Super huge shout out to the fucking traffic. Oh my God. Usually, I-25 can lick my balls,
[02:20:53.470 --> 02:20:56.750]  but that night it was smooth. I can't believe it. That was awesome. Everything went super smooth
[02:20:56.750 --> 02:21:00.830]  that day. Big shout out to Baker at Comedy Works. Big shout out to Comedy Works. Big shout out to
[02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:05.630]  the entire Comedy Works crew. Comedy Works has a podcast, you guys. It's called How Comedy Works.
[02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:10.430]  If you care about comedy, if you're a comedy fan, I of course am, obviously, check it out.
[02:21:10.430 --> 02:21:15.630]  How Comedy Works, hosted by Wendy, the owner of Comedy Works, and a comedian. His name's Rick
[02:21:15.630 --> 02:21:20.830]  Kearns. He's almost famous. He's on the cusp there, but he's really funny, and he's got a
[02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:25.630]  great personality, so check him out. Let's see. Where else are we on this list of things to talk
[02:21:25.630 --> 02:21:29.630]  about? I want to give one more shout out, and then we're going to do a couple things here with the
[02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:35.310]  podcast. I do have some real content, you guys. I owe a shout out to my friend at The Spliff Cast.
[02:21:35.310 --> 02:21:40.110]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's a podcast called The Spliff Cast. They gave me, she gave me a
[02:21:40.110 --> 02:21:43.390]  minute and a half shout out and an endorsement the other day. I listened to her, but somebody
[02:21:43.390 --> 02:21:48.590]  told me, hey, this podcast shouted you out, and so I checked it out. Wow, that's a great show.
[02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:53.230]  Check it out. It's hosted by a lady named Bo Nellis. She's not as hyper as me, and she doesn't
[02:21:53.230 --> 02:21:57.870]  take as many dabs as me, so she's a little more focused. If I'm too much energy for you, if I'm
[02:21:57.870 --> 02:22:02.910]  too hyper and spastic, you'll definitely enjoy her. She's calm. She's more mellow than myself,
[02:22:02.910 --> 02:22:07.310]  and she puts out a great show, so I endorse that fully. Thanks for the shout out. Thanks for the
[02:22:07.310 --> 02:22:14.990]  support, and you guys support my new friend at The Spliff Cast. All right. I am going to open
[02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:19.150]  up iTunes here. I've got a couple of new iTunes comments, you guys. I love the iTunes comments
[02:22:19.150 --> 02:22:22.750]  and the reviews. I would appreciate it if you go to iTunes if you're an iTunes user, if you've got
[02:22:22.750 --> 02:22:26.590]  an iPhone, if you've got a MacBook, whatever, however you're using iTunes. A lot of you guys
[02:22:26.590 --> 02:22:31.070]  are using an Android with Stitcher, but if you've got iTunes, go to the iTunes store, search for the
[02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:34.030]  Grow From Your Heart podcast. When you find ... You got to scroll down to the bottom. There's a
[02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:37.870]  little tab with the logo. It's got the red, gold, and green logo with my face on it. Click on that.
[02:22:37.870 --> 02:22:42.110]  Go to ratings and reviews. It would be super awesome if you typed in a review and then gave
[02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:47.630]  me a rating. Everybody so far has given me a five-star review. I've got 39 five-star reviews.
[02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:51.950]  It'd be cool if you kept that up, but hey, give me what you feel I deserve. That would be awesome.
[02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:57.230]  I'm going to read the two most recent comments. This one just happens to be from Bo at the Spliff
[02:22:57.230 --> 02:23:03.550]  podcast. She said, one episode in and I can tell this show is solid. Can't wait for the new ones
[02:23:03.550 --> 02:23:08.510]  and to go digging through old ones. I can't grow, but in theory, and you got all kinds of delivery
[02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:13.950]  on the theory. Thanks, man. Well, you're very welcome. I appreciate you for listening to the
[02:23:13.950 --> 02:23:20.270]  podcast. It's great hearing other podcasters compliment your podcast. That really means a
[02:23:20.270 --> 02:23:24.430]  lot to me. All the compliments mean a lot to me, but she complimented on her show. She complimented
[02:23:24.430 --> 02:23:29.710]  the sound quality other than me clearing my throat. I apologize for that. She complimented the sound
[02:23:29.710 --> 02:23:33.150]  quality and that means a lot to me. Thanks for noticing. I appreciate that. Thanks for noticing
[02:23:33.150 --> 02:23:37.710]  the show overall. A big shout out to Bo at the Spliff podcast. Our next comment comes from Dab
[02:23:37.710 --> 02:23:42.910]  Smiths. Dab Smiths has become a good friend lately. We've been talking a lot. The comment
[02:23:42.910 --> 02:23:46.830]  says, I got a five-star review also. The comment says, great show as always, buddy. You should try
[02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:50.910]  to do two shows a week on the reg. Thanks for the good podcast to listen to every Monday morning
[02:23:50.910 --> 02:23:55.870]  when I start the daily grind. I usually get the show while I'm prepping my work for the day. Keep
[02:23:55.870 --> 02:24:03.230]  up the good work, amigo. I wish I could promise you two shows every week. Sometimes time doesn't
[02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:07.070]  allow it. This week, of course, being the Thanksgiving week, I just took it off. I wanted
[02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:10.750]  to hang out, spend some time. I actually worked on my garden a little bit. I hung out with that
[02:24:10.750 --> 02:24:14.430]  girl, Jenny Beth, I've been talking about so much. I hung out with some family, hung out with my
[02:24:14.430 --> 02:24:18.030]  kiddo. Yes, I do have a daughter. I don't talk about her a lot on the podcast because she doesn't
[02:24:18.030 --> 02:24:21.790]  want to be talked about, I'm pretty sure, on a podcast, but hung out with her a little bit.
[02:24:22.350 --> 02:24:28.590]  I took the Thursday episode off. I promise you a Monday episode. I will do my best to get you
[02:24:28.590 --> 02:24:32.910]  Thursday episodes as frequently as I can. I appreciate you for listening. I'm glad that
[02:24:32.910 --> 02:24:36.910]  I can make your Mondays better. That was why I put them out on Monday. Mondays are generally
[02:24:36.910 --> 02:24:40.270]  shitty for people who don't like their jobs or don't have the best jobs. People that don't get
[02:24:40.270 --> 02:24:43.790]  to grow weed, people that aren't artists or musicians, your Monday probably sucks. If you're
[02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:47.470]  in the service industry, your Monday sucks. That's why I put them out on Monday morning. I
[02:24:47.470 --> 02:24:50.830]  try to make your day a little bit brighter. I'm glad I'm doing that for you, Dab Smiths. Thanks
[02:24:50.830 --> 02:24:54.990]  for listening. Yeah, I appreciate it. You guys, I would love your comments. If you've got something
[02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:58.190]  else you'd like to say and you don't want to say it on a public forum, you can send me an email.
[02:24:58.190 --> 02:25:04.590]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I would totally love to hear from you. Speaking of
[02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:07.630]  emails, you guys, that's where we're going to get to. I've got an email from a guy.
[02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:12.350]  Dude, I'm going to hit pause and take a drink so I can quick clear my throat. Hold on for just a
[02:25:12.350 --> 02:25:15.310]  second. You don't even have to hold on. Just keep listening. It'll happen through editing.
[02:25:17.630 --> 02:25:20.670]  All right. I feel like that's a little bit better. Of course, it'll come back because I took some
[02:25:20.670 --> 02:25:25.070]  dabs and I ate this. I'm not blaming it on the banana pudding bar, but it is making my throat a
[02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:30.030]  little ... It's getting rid of that buttery thing. Anyway, let's get to this email. Let's start it
[02:25:30.030 --> 02:25:34.430]  off with an email from a dude who said, call him Roscoe. He says, hey dude, it's Roscoe.
[02:25:34.430 --> 02:25:38.990]  I messaged you for advice, which I got from you, from your episodes and it was great stuff,
[02:25:38.990 --> 02:25:43.390]  dude. Keep up the good work. I catch up every Monday at work on your podcast and have done so
[02:25:43.390 --> 02:25:47.470]  for over a year now when I came across it. In fact, dude, it was around that time you said
[02:25:47.470 --> 02:25:52.990]  you'd put money in a pot for your curse words. You guys, a long time ago, I didn't find it very
[02:25:52.990 --> 02:25:57.950]  professional to use any profanity on my podcast and when I would drop F-bombs and other words,
[02:25:57.950 --> 02:26:01.550]  I would try to throw ... I forgot how much money I said I would put in a jar and we actually
[02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:04.910]  donated that to a good cause, but I filled up a jar with a bunch of money, you guys.
[02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:08.510]  Then somebody was like, that's stupid. Be yourself. I hate it when you try to restrain yourself.
[02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:11.710]  I decided, you're right, fuck it. Now I say fuck on the show because it's a lot more,
[02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:15.390]  it's more me, honestly. It's more comfortable and I hate trying to censor myself. It's how I,
[02:26:15.390 --> 02:26:20.110]  I don't know, maybe it's not professional, but that's how I roll and it's me. I'd rather be me
[02:26:20.110 --> 02:26:26.830]  than not to tell you the truth. He continues to say, anyway, safe to say, due to your podcast and
[02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:32.350]  the educated guests you have on, I have successfully grown a lot of nice bushy plants. Awesome. I'm
[02:26:32.350 --> 02:26:37.710]  glad to hear that. He also says, I've saved a ton of money thanks to you guys. Thanks to you guys,
[02:26:37.710 --> 02:26:42.430]  seriously, not buying from the local riffraff has been a weight lifted off of me. Anyway,
[02:26:42.430 --> 02:26:47.310]  I've been thinking for a year now about doing a podcast much similar to yours, bar a few things.
[02:26:48.350 --> 02:26:52.670]  I've got to back up. That's something I don't think about. He says that I've saved him money
[02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:58.990]  and a big hassle not having to buy from the local riffraff. I'm six foot five and 200 pounds and I
[02:26:58.990 --> 02:27:02.830]  don't worry a lot when I used to have to go buy cannabis, but I can only imagine if I were
[02:27:02.830 --> 02:27:07.950]  not this stature and I didn't have this type of upbringing where I'm from and I had to go
[02:27:09.150 --> 02:27:13.230]  into my old neighborhood where I'm actually from to go buy weed. I can just imagine how that would
[02:27:13.230 --> 02:27:16.990]  feel to be some of those people in the stress that that would be. I'm sure people get robbed
[02:27:16.990 --> 02:27:21.390]  and beat up and shit and get sold terrible products that isn't even weed and that's got to
[02:27:21.390 --> 02:27:25.150]  suck. So I'm sure I could lift a lot of weight off people's shoulders if they're able to grow.
[02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:29.790]  I can only imagine that. I didn't even realize that just thinking about the people you can avoid
[02:27:29.790 --> 02:27:33.950]  by not having to buy herb. That's helpful. Anyway, he goes on, I am rambling today. You guys,
[02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:38.030]  I apologize. I'm going to blame it on the 200 milligram Schumet bar that I ate and the, uh,
[02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:41.790]  what is this? How many ounces of this is like 16 ounces of Dr. Pepper together. Whoa,
[02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:47.710]  that's a combo. You guys, I'd be feeling it. He says, uh, I've been thinking about doing a four.
[02:27:47.710 --> 02:27:52.350]  I've been thinking for over a year now about doing a podcast, much similar to you, similar to yours,
[02:27:52.350 --> 02:27:58.350]  bar a few things. Then he says, I am in the UK and there's not really a podcast out here for the UK
[02:27:58.350 --> 02:28:03.470]  people. And you have inspired me to want to be that podcast. The law is changing slowly here.
[02:28:03.470 --> 02:28:08.670]  The NHS are testing it for the first time now. And all the MPs want to advise our new prime
[02:28:08.670 --> 02:28:15.790]  minister, Mr. May to legalize cannabis. Oh, that's awesome. There's a lot of amazing stuff in that
[02:28:15.790 --> 02:28:22.350]  one paragraph. I've inspired somebody to want to create a podcast for their, for their, the UK,
[02:28:22.350 --> 02:28:27.950]  for the entire UK about cannabis, because there isn't one. That's awesome. I am that I'm honored
[02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:31.950]  that I inspired somebody to do that. Also, I'm glad that I inspired you to do that. That that's
[02:28:31.950 --> 02:28:36.750]  going to lead me to part of my reply to your email. Uh, it's also great that the law is slowly changing
[02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:40.510]  there. I know some areas in the UK have really strict shitty cannabis laws. I'm glad that they're
[02:28:40.510 --> 02:28:46.670]  easing up on that. Uh, I love that the MPs want to advise the minister, uh, that they want them to
[02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:51.230]  legalize cannabis when, when I'm pretty sure that's the military police. I'm not sure exactly. I
[02:28:51.230 --> 02:28:56.110]  didn't research that, but whoever, when other, when other people are like, Hey, do this, that's
[02:28:56.110 --> 02:29:00.030]  really helpful. So this guy goes on to say, I want to educate people and teach them how to grow
[02:29:00.030 --> 02:29:04.830]  small secret setups and have fun doing it. UK cannabis, news, culture, education, chats, and
[02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:10.350]  more, uh, if not illegal to encourage on a podcast, you know, I don't think it's illegal to encourage
[02:29:10.350 --> 02:29:14.670]  on a podcast, but where you are, you may want to talk to a lawyer because I don't know the rules in
[02:29:14.670 --> 02:29:18.270]  the UK. That could be completely different. I've been told that I'm safe as long as I'm careful.
[02:29:18.990 --> 02:29:23.070]  And we try to be careful here on the show. Uh, so check on that yourself. That's the best I
[02:29:23.070 --> 02:29:27.470]  can say there, but you go on to say, could you give me any advice on doing this? Any tips,
[02:29:27.470 --> 02:29:32.590]  tricks, et cetera, to a successful, successful podcast. And he said, thanks dude. Much love
[02:29:33.310 --> 02:29:36.750]  Roscoe. And then he also said, PS, don't mind if you read it on your podcast, which is good
[02:29:36.750 --> 02:29:41.230]  because I just read the whole email on the podcast. First off, thank you for the email.
[02:29:41.230 --> 02:29:45.630]  Second, I'm glad that I can inspire you to do a podcast about cannabis. Third,
[02:29:45.630 --> 02:29:49.310]  thanks for being so passionate about cannabis because it sounds like it's illegal there and
[02:29:49.310 --> 02:29:52.830]  you're risking your life and your safety and your family and your freedom and your finances and your
[02:29:52.830 --> 02:29:57.310]  future for this plant because you're in love. So thanks for being on this team. And that,
[02:29:57.310 --> 02:30:02.990]  that leads me to my answer. My part of my reply. Uh, I know that you're the right person to do
[02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:08.350]  this podcast because you have taken the effort to reach out to me to say, what should I do?
[02:30:08.350 --> 02:30:12.270]  So that tells me right there, you are supposed to be the guy doing this podcast,
[02:30:12.270 --> 02:30:18.350]  be the confident dude that you are. Uh, when you go to make your podcast, talk to the people,
[02:30:18.350 --> 02:30:21.390]  just like you did to me in this email, because this is comfortable and it sounds like you're
[02:30:21.470 --> 02:30:25.710]  cool person and it sounds like you can connect with people. So do that on your podcast. Just
[02:30:25.710 --> 02:30:31.150]  be yourself. That's the best advice I can give to any person trying to do any podcast. Be you.
[02:30:32.190 --> 02:30:36.110]  If you're fake, your listeners will know it. You won't have any fun. It won't feel good. And you'll
[02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:40.590]  come across fake and people can spot fake and they won't listen to fake and you'll get more
[02:30:40.590 --> 02:30:46.750]  shitty emails than you could ever imagine. So chill out, be yourself, uh, edit a little bit,
[02:30:46.750 --> 02:30:51.630]  but don't take out all of your, your mistakes. I, I stutter. I say dumb shit. I say the wrong
[02:30:51.630 --> 02:30:55.950]  shit and I talk over myself all the time, but that's me. And I've learned to accept me.
[02:30:55.950 --> 02:31:00.110]  And it makes a good podcast. Just being me. People don't want me to be a Paul. I'm not the
[02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:04.510]  president. I don't need to come out here, up here and speak some perfect shit to you. Teaching how
[02:31:04.510 --> 02:31:08.990]  to grow weeds. So be yourself, be comfortable, uh, get some good equipment. That's something I
[02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:14.350]  really should say. You don't need to spend a lot of money. My favorite setup is the zoom age six on
[02:31:14.350 --> 02:31:21.070]  the go. I use a zoom age six and I run four Sennheiser eight 35, eight 35 microphones into
[02:31:21.070 --> 02:31:25.390]  that. I'm not sure what's available in the UK. You could probably get that or very similar.
[02:31:25.390 --> 02:31:30.110]  Uh, it's a great recording device. A lot of people use that, uh, for my big setup,
[02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:34.990]  there's a lot of stuff happening, but sound quality is certainly important. People. If
[02:31:34.990 --> 02:31:39.150]  when people do phone calls on a podcast or if they Skype in, I don't even listen. So
[02:31:39.950 --> 02:31:45.790]  get good quality. So I'd really stress on good quality. Sound good. Sound the best you can make
[02:31:45.790 --> 02:31:49.230]  sure that there's no funky noise in the background, or if you're going to do it in a coffee shop and
[02:31:49.230 --> 02:31:53.550]  you want that clunky like dishes and waitress sound vibe kind of thing. Go for that. If that's
[02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:56.590]  your vibe, I don't like that. I like it quiet. When I talk there, when I don't talk, there's no
[02:31:56.590 --> 02:32:00.910]  noise in my background. I love that sort of feel. So sound how you want to sound, achieve your sound,
[02:32:00.910 --> 02:32:07.310]  figure out how you got to do that, be yourself, and then find content that relates to the audience
[02:32:07.310 --> 02:32:12.270]  you want to hit, which is obviously cannabis and news and culture and education and chats.
[02:32:12.270 --> 02:32:16.670]  So find some people in your community that you can get on a show and build a relationship with.
[02:32:16.670 --> 02:32:21.710]  What I found is the people that come back to my show the third and fourth time they come back,
[02:32:21.710 --> 02:32:25.950]  they forget they're on a podcast and they're now hanging out in my little recording space. And we
[02:32:25.950 --> 02:32:30.430]  just happen to have headphones and a microphone on, and we really get talking about cannabis
[02:32:30.430 --> 02:32:34.510]  in a way that we love instead of a way that feels podcasty and interviewee.
[02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:38.990]  You guys notice when Jesse comes back, the first time Jesse was here, you guys, a hundred episodes,
[02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:44.670]  Jesse talked like this, said four words, like, okay, yeah. And now when Jesse comes on,
[02:32:44.670 --> 02:32:48.990]  you can't get him to shut up, you guys. So just get, kind of build a relationship with somebody
[02:32:48.990 --> 02:32:53.390]  that you can get on the podcast. Try to find people that are experts in certain areas of
[02:32:53.390 --> 02:32:59.390]  cannabis. Like I've got a guy, Jesse's my outdoor guy. Of course, Sean is kind of the organics guy,
[02:32:59.390 --> 02:33:03.550]  even though he's hard to get ahold of lately. Spencer was our extracts guy, even though he's
[02:33:03.550 --> 02:33:07.390]  moved. So try to have guys that you can have like specialized, like you got guys for everything in
[02:33:07.390 --> 02:33:12.670]  your life. You got a weed guy, you got a fireworks guy, you got a whatever guy, get those guys for
[02:33:12.670 --> 02:33:18.670]  your podcast also. So that's something I could recommend. Here's something that I could talk
[02:33:18.670 --> 02:33:23.790]  about from being a podcast nerd. If you want to be noticed in iTunes, get at least eight or 10
[02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:29.470]  episodes put together before you launch into iTunes, because your first eight weeks in iTunes
[02:33:29.470 --> 02:33:34.190]  is when they will notice you. And that's if you get good ratings and you pop out with a lot of
[02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:38.990]  quality content, iTunes will put you in the new and noteworthy category, which will get you a lot
[02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:44.750]  more views and or listens. So try to get eight episodes put together, drop a lot of quality
[02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:50.830]  content in eight weeks, and you'll get up there in iTunes. I feel like another guy that I listen
[02:33:50.830 --> 02:33:54.190]  to, you guys, a lot of what I've learned on podcasting, I got to give somebody a shout out
[02:33:54.190 --> 02:33:57.950]  here because I feel like I just turned, I channeled this guy. There's a guy named Cliff Ravenscraft.
[02:33:58.830 --> 02:34:03.870]  He is known as the Podcast Answer Man. If you go to thepodcastanswerman.com,
[02:34:03.870 --> 02:34:07.870]  Cliff will teach you a lot of stuff about podcasting. There's a lot of paid content
[02:34:07.870 --> 02:34:11.550]  on his website. He will want you to sign up for his podcasting A to Z courses.
[02:34:11.550 --> 02:34:17.070]  He'll try to get you to pay for a lot of online courses. I have not paid for anything, and I have
[02:34:17.070 --> 02:34:21.870]  learned a tremendous amount about podcasting just through Cliff Ravenscraft's free stuff,
[02:34:21.870 --> 02:34:26.270]  through his Twitter feeds, through his email groups, just stuff like that. So you can always
[02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:31.870]  contact Cliff Ravenscraft or podcastanswerman.com. That is a wealth of podcasting knowledge.
[02:34:32.670 --> 02:34:36.750]  All right. Roscoe, I feel like I have given you a lot of podcasting information,
[02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:41.230]  and this is a cannabis podcast. So I am going to try to wrangle my listeners back up,
[02:34:41.230 --> 02:34:47.230]  and I'm going to read an email about cannabis next. Roscoe, I truly appreciate your efforts.
[02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:51.950]  I want to know how your podcast goes. If you do get this podcast launched, or if you need any
[02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:55.790]  help getting this podcast launched, send me another email. I would be truly delighted to
[02:34:55.790 --> 02:34:59.950]  help you get your podcast going. I'll give you all the advice I can. Things are going to be a
[02:34:59.950 --> 02:35:03.550]  little bit different because you're in the UK. Some of the setup may be different, but we'll get
[02:35:03.550 --> 02:35:06.990]  it going. We'll figure it out. Between the two of us, we're smart enough to get this going. I can't
[02:35:06.990 --> 02:35:11.070]  wait to hear your show. And also, thanks for listening, and thanks for the email. I look
[02:35:11.070 --> 02:35:14.990]  forward to hearing your show in the future. Don't put it off, because if you keep putting it off,
[02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:18.510]  it'll just fall to the wayside and you'll forget. Get it going. All right, you guys,
[02:35:18.510 --> 02:35:22.430]  I need to take a quick drink, then I'm going to read another email about cannabis. All right,
[02:35:22.430 --> 02:35:25.950]  you guys, I got a quick drink. I took a fat dab, and I'm ready to read another email.
[02:35:25.950 --> 02:35:28.910]  This one comes from, you know what? I don't know if he wants me to say his name. Let's see. I'm
[02:35:28.910 --> 02:35:32.590]  looking. I don't have any indicator, so I'm not going to say your name, dude, but big shout out.
[02:35:32.590 --> 02:35:36.910]  You know who you are. I appreciate you for sending an email. Now I will read your message. It goes
[02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:41.390]  like this. It says, hey, bro, loving the show. Been listening for over a year now. First, I want
[02:35:41.390 --> 02:35:45.870]  to thank you for spreading the knowledge and being a voice for the cannabis community. Awesome, man.
[02:35:45.870 --> 02:35:50.110]  First off, thanks for listening. Second, I guess I'm glad to be that voice for the community. I
[02:35:50.110 --> 02:35:54.350]  guess I'm just the guy that grabbed a mic and wanted to do that. I never thought of that.
[02:35:54.350 --> 02:35:58.030]  Trying to think about it, then it'll put too much pressure on me. Anyway, he goes on and he says,
[02:35:58.030 --> 02:36:02.750]  my question I hope you can give your thoughts on is a term known as bud washing. I had a good
[02:36:02.750 --> 02:36:06.750]  friend telling me to try it. In case you're unfamiliar with the term, it's where you take
[02:36:06.750 --> 02:36:12.350]  your just harvested buds that are still on the branches, and you dip or wash them in water.
[02:36:12.350 --> 02:36:17.630]  I read it's supposed to get dust particles off of your herb and make it cleaner, tastier smoke.
[02:36:18.270 --> 02:36:21.950]  Then he also says, thanks for turning me on to Richie Spice. I heard you mentioning him on a
[02:36:21.950 --> 02:36:26.510]  previous episode, so I searched him out. Then he quotes some Richie Spice. Oh man, you're glad.
[02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:29.950]  All right, you're welcome. I'm glad you like Richie Spice. He goes, I'm high as shit tonight.
[02:36:29.950 --> 02:36:35.870]  This Schumet bar is kicking in. I ate this an hour and a half-ish ago. Yeah, I'm floating around in
[02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:39.550]  my chair here. 200 milligrams of THC distillate. We'll get to you. Plus, I've had a few dabs.
[02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:44.750]  Kind of floating around. I like it. I love it. Try it. I'm going to kind of talk about what he
[02:36:44.750 --> 02:36:50.030]  asked here. He said, is bud washing a term that I am familiar with? Yes. I learned this from Jorge
[02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:56.270]  Cervantes. Jorge didn't do it with just water. Jorge took a five-gallon bucket of ... He used
[02:36:56.270 --> 02:37:00.190]  reverse osmosis water. You can use water from the hose if your water is okay. If you don't have
[02:37:00.190 --> 02:37:04.990]  funky-ass water, you can use water from your hose. Fill up a five-gallon bucket of water.
[02:37:04.990 --> 02:37:11.150]  Then Jorge was putting 25 ... I've seen people put more, you guys, but 25 is probably what I
[02:37:11.150 --> 02:37:18.430]  would recommend. 25 or 30 milliliters of 30% hydrogen peroxide into a five-gallon bucket of
[02:37:18.430 --> 02:37:23.310]  water. Not the hydrogen peroxide that your mom's got in the cabinet. The stuff that you buy,
[02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:29.950]  you can get it at the hydro store probably. You can get it online, but it's 30%, maybe 33%,
[02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:36.910]  maybe 35% hydrogen peroxide. It's not expensive, but you put about 30 milliliters of that, 25,
[02:37:36.910 --> 02:37:42.190]  30 mils in a five-gallon bucket, stir it up real good, and then you harvest the branches.
[02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:47.070]  And you leave these long branches, six to eight-inch long branches, and wear rubber gloves
[02:37:48.190 --> 02:37:53.310]  and dunk the entire branch into the water and give it a swirl. Freshly chopped. You want to chop the
[02:37:53.310 --> 02:37:58.270]  plants down, cut off all the big leaves, trim it up like you're going to trim it up again later.
[02:37:58.270 --> 02:38:01.230]  You're just cleaning it up. You're not manicuring it. You're just trimming it.
[02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:07.070]  Then dunk that into the water solution, the peroxide water solution. Give it a good swirl
[02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:12.030]  so that if there is perhaps powdery mildew on there, you can knock that powdery mildew off.
[02:38:12.030 --> 02:38:16.430]  That is a really good way to get powdery mildew. If you don't have the PM on there,
[02:38:16.430 --> 02:38:20.430]  I guess that would knock dust off if you grew it outside and it got dusty and shit,
[02:38:20.430 --> 02:38:24.750]  but I don't see how much dust is really going to be on your plants if you grew indoors in a good
[02:38:24.750 --> 02:38:29.070]  grow environment. But I've heard of this being done by Jorge Cervantes, and I've seen it done
[02:38:29.070 --> 02:38:34.590]  by other people for powdery mildew and other problems like that to clean that stuff off.
[02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:41.150]  A little bit of peroxide, 25 to 30 mils in a five-gallon bucket of clean water. Cut the branches
[02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:44.670]  into six or eight-inch, maybe 10-inch sections. It's got to fit in that five-gallon bucket.
[02:38:44.670 --> 02:38:49.070]  Dunk it in there, give it a good shake, then hang it up. Give the buds plenty of space when they're
[02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:52.350]  hung up, when they're that wet, and they're just going to drip onto the floor, you guys.
[02:38:52.350 --> 02:38:56.910]  All that water is going to drip all over the floor, and it's just going to run right out,
[02:38:56.910 --> 02:39:00.670]  and then it'll dry. Keep a fan in the room, maybe a dehumidifier in there. Pay attention
[02:39:00.670 --> 02:39:04.430]  to the conditions in your drying area. But if you're going to do this, you got to pay attention,
[02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:08.590]  and don't let it get too humid in there. A lot of people are going to say,
[02:39:08.590 --> 02:39:12.030]  you're going to soak buds that were just harvested. You guys, if you think about it,
[02:39:12.030 --> 02:39:16.270]  cannabis plants grow outside. And if it weren't for us getting in the way, they would get wet
[02:39:16.270 --> 02:39:20.750]  all the damn time. I don't think that every cannabis plant that ever got wet outside got
[02:39:20.750 --> 02:39:24.030]  destroyed. I'm pretty sure that a lot of them got stronger and they got tougher.
[02:39:24.750 --> 02:39:29.390]  If you look at the shape of a cannabis plant, it is kind of shaped like an umbrella. When water
[02:39:29.390 --> 02:39:35.630]  hits a cannabis plant, the leaves push the water in an outward direction, and it spreads it out so
[02:39:35.630 --> 02:39:40.270]  that it falls down. Now, that tells me that you should water the plants around that area, because
[02:39:40.270 --> 02:39:43.550]  that's where the roots are going to grow out, because in nature, that's where the water is
[02:39:43.550 --> 02:39:46.670]  going to land. Of course, you want to get it into where the stalk, but the outward area is a little
[02:39:46.670 --> 02:39:50.590]  bit more where you want it, because nature would spread it out. So cannabis is going to search for
[02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:55.870]  roots out that way because it knows that, you guys. Also, the resin glands on your plant will
[02:39:55.870 --> 02:40:00.110]  protect it from the water. You're not going to bust that off by just giving it a little dunk.
[02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:04.750]  It's not going to come off there. These guys that make hash, they're using a washing machine and ice
[02:40:04.750 --> 02:40:09.550]  to pull those trichomes off of your buds. So a little bit of a dunk isn't going to pull those
[02:40:09.550 --> 02:40:13.310]  off of there. If you've already got a little bit of PM, or if you had an issue, this is a good way
[02:40:13.310 --> 02:40:17.390]  to get rid of it. It's funny because in Colorado, I make the joke that nobody gets powdery mildew
[02:40:17.390 --> 02:40:23.070]  anymore ever since anybody invented or figured out how to make BHO. Everybody just fucking blasts
[02:40:23.070 --> 02:40:27.790]  it, even though it's got powdery mildew on it. But I wouldn't recommend using a whole... If it's
[02:40:27.790 --> 02:40:31.950]  got a lot of powdery mildew, don't use it. Get rid of that product, get rid of that material.
[02:40:31.950 --> 02:40:35.550]  But if you've just got a little bit of a problem, like people in Oregon this year got pummeled with
[02:40:35.550 --> 02:40:39.230]  powdery mildew and other molds. This will not handle your brown mold. This will not handle
[02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:43.710]  shit like that. But a little bit of powdery mildew, this peroxide solution will get rid of it. Yes,
[02:40:43.710 --> 02:40:48.350]  you can do it if you want to get the dust and the dirt off if you grew outside. A lot of people find
[02:40:48.350 --> 02:40:54.030]  like cocoons or caterpillar silk on their buds. That would be a good way to get rid of that stuff.
[02:40:54.030 --> 02:40:57.150]  Just give it a good dunk. That way you know it's clean. Just make sure you're getting plenty of
[02:40:57.150 --> 02:41:00.830]  ventilation, plenty of airflow when it dries. It's going to dry up like normal. It's just going to
[02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:05.230]  take a little bit longer. You won't notice a difference. I'm pretty sure you can take a bud
[02:41:05.230 --> 02:41:09.470]  that did not get dunked and a bud that did get dunked and dried properly and trimmed and cured
[02:41:09.470 --> 02:41:13.390]  properly and you can smoke them both, and you will not be able to tell the difference.
[02:41:14.350 --> 02:41:17.470]  That's my opinion on that. Yes, I've heard of this. I've seen it in practice.
[02:41:18.110 --> 02:41:21.470]  I don't know that I have personally tried it, but I've seen it done. I've been places that have done
[02:41:21.470 --> 02:41:25.390]  it. It's kind of a semi-common practice in commercial grows, to tell you the truth,
[02:41:25.390 --> 02:41:30.430]  because it is legal in Colorado to do that, two buds grown in a commercial facility.
[02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:34.670]  All right. I think that's all I've got time for. I don't want to start another email because I've
[02:41:34.670 --> 02:41:38.830]  been going for close to 30 minutes. It's hard to do a long episode by myself. I feel like I just
[02:41:38.830 --> 02:41:42.190]  start chattering and I get way off course. I'm going to start wrapping up the show.
[02:41:42.590 --> 02:41:47.390]  I want to let you guys know about a website known as Patreon. If you guys feel like you want to
[02:41:47.390 --> 02:41:51.230]  contribute to the podcast, Patreon is the way to do it. A lot of people have sent me a message like,
[02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:55.390]  hey, on the website, you used to have a donation button and that is gone. What happened to that?
[02:41:55.390 --> 02:42:02.350]  PayPal did not like having their service attached to my website that was about a podcast that was
[02:42:02.350 --> 02:42:06.030]  about growing cannabis. They felt like that was inappropriate and they didn't want to be involved,
[02:42:06.030 --> 02:42:10.750]  so they made me take the PayPal link off of my website. That's gone. What we can do,
[02:42:10.750 --> 02:42:14.750]  we can set you up with Patreon. I'm going to pull up the website right here. I've got it stored so
[02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:21.870]  that I can make sure to give you the right link. It is Patreon, P-A-T-R-E-O-N, patreon.com slash
[02:42:21.870 --> 02:42:25.550]  grow from your heart. If you go there, you can find out how to become a member of Patreon,
[02:42:25.550 --> 02:42:30.910]  how you can sign up and you can contribute to the podcast. You can sign up and you can contribute.
[02:42:30.910 --> 02:42:34.750]  It's like a monthly service. If you want to contribute monthly, you can throw as little
[02:42:34.830 --> 02:42:40.270]  as $1 in every month. I would totally appreciate it. Honestly, you guys, what that is going for
[02:42:40.270 --> 02:42:45.630]  is it will pay for the web hosting for my website, iRegeneticsColorado.com. It does cost me a little
[02:42:45.630 --> 02:42:49.790]  bit of money to keep that running on a yearly basis. I have to pay that fee and that's what
[02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:54.990]  keeps the Grow From Your Heart podcast feed alive. That's all I'm asking for. I'm not trying
[02:42:54.990 --> 02:42:59.470]  to get rich off the podcast. I'm just trying to offset the cost of my web fees. I've already
[02:42:59.470 --> 02:43:03.950]  bought the equipment. Sometimes shit breaks, so maybe I'll ask on Patreon for help with that.
[02:43:03.950 --> 02:43:07.950]  So far, I'm just trying to pay for the cost of the website. I would appreciate it if you
[02:43:07.950 --> 02:43:12.110]  contributed. I'm going to quit begging because it already feels a little funky. All right, guys,
[02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:14.670]  I want to thank you guys for listening to another episode of the podcast. I want to give a huge
[02:43:14.670 --> 02:43:18.830]  shout out to my friend Baker at Comedy Works. Also, shout out to Jenny Beth. Also, a huge shout
[02:43:18.830 --> 02:43:23.950]  out to everybody at Comedy Works who always treats me like a king every time I go there.
[02:43:23.950 --> 02:43:28.030]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you again that I would appreciate it if you go to iTunes,
[02:43:28.030 --> 02:43:32.030]  click on the iTunes store, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast, click on it. There's
[02:43:32.030 --> 02:43:35.950]  my face on there. Click on that. Go to the ratings and review section. Type in a rating.
[02:43:35.950 --> 02:43:39.870]  No, type in a review. That's it. Type in a review. Let me know what you think of the podcast. I will
[02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:45.070]  read your review on a future episode. Everybody so far has given me a five-star review. You can
[02:43:45.070 --> 02:43:48.830]  give me as many stars as you feel I deserve. If you want to be a weirdo and stand out, don't do
[02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:52.670]  five, but I think it'd be cool if you gave me five like everybody else. Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:43:52.670 --> 02:43:58.110]  this Schumet bar is really kicking in hardcore. If you want to... Shit, I can't even talk now.
[02:43:58.110 --> 02:44:01.390]  If you've got a product you'd like me to review, that's what I was trying to say. Or if you've got
[02:44:01.390 --> 02:44:05.470]  something you'd like to say, you can send me an email. It's growfromyourheart.com. I'd also like
[02:44:05.470 --> 02:44:09.630]  it if you follow me on the social media. I'm on Facebook. It's Grow From Your Heart podcast. I'm
[02:44:09.630 --> 02:44:17.310]  on Twitter. It's at GFYH podcast. You guys, I got to 10,000 followers on Instagram. It's

[02:44:28.830 --> 02:44:31.870]  pussy. I think it's time to wrap up the podcast. I want to thank you guys for listening.
[02:44:32.670 --> 02:44:55.110]  Big shout out to my ninja spence. Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
