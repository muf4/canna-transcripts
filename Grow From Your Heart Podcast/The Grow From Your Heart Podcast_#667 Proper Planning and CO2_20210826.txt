[00:01.790 --> 00:16.780]  All right, here we go.
[00:16.780 --> 00:18.420]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:18.420 --> 00:25.120]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 667 of the Grow From Your
[00:25.120 --> 00:26.860]  Heart Podcast.
[00:26.860 --> 00:30.220]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on a couple of grow questions.
[00:30.220 --> 00:33.740]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:33.740 --> 00:37.260]  folks who support the show on Patreon.
[00:37.260 --> 00:41.960]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to Wogwan.
[00:41.960 --> 00:44.460]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Guido7.
[00:44.460 --> 00:49.020]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Slightly Stoned Stupid42.
[00:49.020 --> 00:52.980]  Let's send a big fist bump and a shout out to a longtime supporter, TheBafsta.
[00:52.980 --> 00:58.600]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Eric and Nick P and Rasufa and Tartan Mike.
[00:58.600 --> 01:01.140]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Grandpa Mark.
[01:01.140 --> 01:04.700]  And then let's wrap it all up with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout
[01:04.700 --> 01:07.740]  out to RollMe1Kenobi.
[01:07.740 --> 01:12.740]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:12.740 --> 01:16.460]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:16.460 --> 01:23.020]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:23.020 --> 01:26.520]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen and you know I do include a
[01:26.520 --> 01:30.940]  link in the show notes and the video description to make it nice and easy.
[01:30.940 --> 01:35.420]  Once again just as a reminder if you're searching for the Patreon and you can't find it, you
[01:35.420 --> 01:41.100]  do have to type in the full URL patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:41.100 --> 01:43.500]  That will make it pop up in the search.
[01:43.500 --> 01:48.180]  Then you do know that I've been inviting everybody to the Discord server.
[01:48.180 --> 01:53.100]  That's right the iRegenetics iReArmy Grow From Your Heart Podcast Discord server has
[01:53.100 --> 01:54.300]  been growing.
[01:54.300 --> 01:59.420]  I think by the time this episode comes out we should have hit 1,200 members on the Discord
[01:59.420 --> 02:00.520]  server.
[02:00.520 --> 02:01.520]  Thank you.
[02:01.520 --> 02:02.520]  Join us.
[02:02.520 --> 02:05.160]  There is a link in the show notes and the video description so that you can pop into
[02:05.160 --> 02:10.080]  the Discord server, join the conversation, see what's going on, maybe win some prizes,
[02:10.080 --> 02:11.080]  get some giveaways.
[02:11.080 --> 02:13.980]  There are some other things happening that may interest you.
[02:13.980 --> 02:16.360]  The link is in the description.
[02:16.360 --> 02:19.840]  I do want to thank everybody for the big response to the merchandise.
[02:19.840 --> 02:24.480]  I recently put some new merchandise on my website and it mostly sold out.
[02:24.480 --> 02:26.120]  There's one item left.
[02:26.120 --> 02:27.520]  That stuff went very quickly.
[02:27.520 --> 02:30.360]  Many people have no idea what I'm even talking about.
[02:30.360 --> 02:33.660]  Big thank you to everybody who grabbed that merchandise so quickly.
[02:33.660 --> 02:35.360]  There is more stuff coming.
[02:35.360 --> 02:38.440]  People are right now they're saying, how did he put up stuff and I didn't even know about
[02:38.440 --> 02:39.440]  it?
[02:39.440 --> 02:40.440]  What is he talking about?
[02:40.440 --> 02:41.440]  That's right.
[02:41.440 --> 02:42.760]  There was new merch that went on my website and it sold out.
[02:42.760 --> 02:44.500]  You may have never even known.
[02:44.500 --> 02:47.440]  The way to stay updated is to join the newsletter.
[02:47.440 --> 02:48.960]  Go to my website.
[02:48.960 --> 02:52.920]  Most of the way down on the website there is a spot that says join the iRegenetics newsletter
[02:52.920 --> 02:54.300]  and stay up to date.
[02:54.300 --> 02:58.680]  If you put in your email address you'll get a newsletter approximately once a month that
[02:58.680 --> 03:02.960]  will let you know there's new merchandise, maybe new strains being released, maybe new
[03:02.960 --> 03:04.280]  coupon codes.
[03:04.280 --> 03:05.920]  Stay updated with the newsletter.
[03:05.920 --> 03:09.600]  Also Discord and Patreon heard it first.
[03:09.600 --> 03:11.080]  Join us on the Patreon.
[03:11.080 --> 03:12.540]  Join us on the Discord.
[03:12.540 --> 03:16.640]  Make sure you sign up for the newsletter to stay up to date with all the stuff going on.
[03:16.640 --> 03:17.640]  All right.
[03:17.640 --> 03:22.360]  I don't want to brag too much but oh my goodness I'm so excited you guys.
[03:22.360 --> 03:23.760]  Some of the restrictions have lifted.
[03:23.760 --> 03:27.600]  It feels like maybe possibly temporarily but I've been going to comedy shows and it feels
[03:27.800 --> 03:29.160]  so good.
[03:29.160 --> 03:30.280]  Big shout out to my buddy Clint.
[03:30.280 --> 03:33.460]  We went and saw Doug Stanhope a few nights ago.
[03:33.460 --> 03:34.460]  Not Doug Benson.
[03:34.460 --> 03:35.600]  I do talk about Doug Benson.
[03:35.600 --> 03:40.240]  People probably automatically subconsciously heard Doug Benson but we saw Doug Stanhope
[03:40.240 --> 03:41.480]  a few nights ago.
[03:41.480 --> 03:43.880]  I've seen so many comedians in my lifetime.
[03:43.880 --> 03:46.000]  I'm a huge comedy nerd.
[03:46.000 --> 03:47.680]  That was my first time seeing Stanhope.
[03:47.680 --> 03:48.960]  I've never seen Stanhope before.
[03:48.960 --> 03:51.920]  I've been listening to his podcast for probably years.
[03:51.920 --> 03:54.680]  I've known who Stanhope was for a very long time.
[03:54.680 --> 03:56.300]  He's always been one of my favorite comedians.
[03:56.300 --> 03:57.900]  He was part of the Man Show.
[03:57.900 --> 04:00.020]  He was buddies with Joe Rogan.
[04:00.020 --> 04:03.580]  He's been one of my favorite comedians for a long time but to see him live was a huge
[04:03.580 --> 04:04.580]  honor.
[04:04.580 --> 04:05.580]  I've been super excited for that.
[04:05.580 --> 04:09.300]  Of course I had tickets about 18 months ago and everything got pushed back because of
[04:09.300 --> 04:10.540]  I don't know what happened.
[04:10.540 --> 04:12.120]  Some weird shit delayed everything.
[04:12.120 --> 04:16.400]  Everybody was like 18 months late for something but it was a great time to see him.
[04:16.400 --> 04:18.940]  He fucking blew the roof off that building.
[04:18.940 --> 04:19.940]  He crushed.
[04:19.940 --> 04:20.940]  He's got such a great rhythm.
[04:20.940 --> 04:24.980]  It took him a minute to get into his rhythm but once he got into that rhythm he's got
[04:24.980 --> 04:25.980]  a really cadence.
[04:25.980 --> 04:27.460]  He keeps doing these hand movements.
[04:27.460 --> 04:29.860]  He does a thing and that's comedy.
[04:29.860 --> 04:31.660]  You set up a joke and you tell the punchline.
[04:31.660 --> 04:36.940]  You set up a joke and tell the punchline but Doug Stanhope has a very distinct rhythm and
[04:36.940 --> 04:39.380]  way of talking and a way of thinking.
[04:39.380 --> 04:44.700]  He does a lot of set up, punchline, then a couple of more punchlines after that.
[04:44.700 --> 04:46.580]  Just the way he was doing it was beautiful.
[04:46.580 --> 04:48.860]  He hit that rhythm, that thing that I'm used to.
[04:48.860 --> 04:52.500]  When you go see your favorite band, when they play your favorite song, comedians don't have
[04:52.500 --> 04:53.500]  a favorite.
[04:53.860 --> 04:57.300]  Most comedians don't repeat their jokes a lot.
[04:57.300 --> 04:59.860]  To hear him hit that rhythm was what I was looking for.
[04:59.860 --> 05:00.860]  It just felt so good.
[05:00.860 --> 05:01.860]  I was like, there he is.
[05:01.860 --> 05:02.860]  That's the rhythm.
[05:02.860 --> 05:05.620]  Anyway, I'm just excited to be going to comedy shows again.
[05:05.620 --> 05:07.620]  I'm excited to be back doing stuff.
[05:07.620 --> 05:08.620]  It is such a good time.
[05:08.620 --> 05:10.100]  I had to talk about that a little bit.
[05:10.100 --> 05:14.740]  Give my buddy Clint a big shout out for being a good comedy bro, a good road dog.
[05:14.740 --> 05:16.220]  He's also watching the podcast.
[05:16.220 --> 05:17.220]  What's up bro?
[05:17.220 --> 05:19.180]  Go out in the garden and pull some leaves.
[05:19.180 --> 05:20.660]  I just wanted to talk about comedy.
[05:20.660 --> 05:21.660]  It is so exciting.
[05:21.820 --> 05:25.500]  If you know anything about me, that's just a little view into my personal life, into
[05:25.500 --> 05:26.540]  my personal world here.
[05:26.540 --> 05:30.700]  I love comedy and it is so good to get back out and see comedy.
[05:30.700 --> 05:36.180]  If all goes well, the boys from Phish are coming here in just a couple of weeks.
[05:36.180 --> 05:37.180]  I can't wait for that.
[05:37.180 --> 05:39.860]  All right, let's focus on cannabis growing and a podcast here.
[05:39.860 --> 05:42.140]  I did say that I was going to read a couple of grow messages.
[05:42.140 --> 05:44.020]  I've got a message here right in front of me.
[05:44.020 --> 05:47.220]  This one came from ... I don't know if they want their name said.
[05:47.220 --> 05:48.260]  Let's read this a little bit.
[05:48.260 --> 05:50.820]  We're not going to say their name because it does talk about a commercial grow and I
[05:50.980 --> 05:53.780]  don't want to get anybody in trouble.
[05:53.780 --> 05:56.420]  This message goes just like this.
[05:56.420 --> 06:01.220]  Of course, if you want to send me an email, the email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[06:01.220 --> 06:03.300]  or on the website there is a grow help tab.
[06:03.300 --> 06:07.380]  If you go to the website, click on grow help, we do ask you a few questions.
[06:07.380 --> 06:11.500]  We ask you about your temperature, your humidity, what kind of lights you're running, stuff
[06:11.500 --> 06:12.500]  like that.
[06:12.500 --> 06:16.180]  Then we will answer your grow questions from the grow help tab.
[06:16.180 --> 06:20.380]  Growfromyourheartathotmail.com, the grow help tab, or of course Patreon are simple ways
[06:20.420 --> 06:21.580]  to get me your messages.
[06:21.580 --> 06:23.180]  This one goes a lot like this.
[06:23.180 --> 06:25.580]  It says, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[06:25.580 --> 06:27.540]  I hope all is well with you brother.
[06:27.540 --> 06:28.540]  Things are great man.
[06:28.540 --> 06:31.900]  I've been seeing comedy shows and having a good time and it's finally starting to cool
[06:31.900 --> 06:32.900]  down.
[06:32.900 --> 06:37.980]  It was 108 degrees consecutively for a few days here, consistently for a few days here
[06:37.980 --> 06:40.540]  and it is cooling down so that's a great thing.
[06:40.540 --> 06:43.380]  Thanks for the knowledge and love you send out every week.
[06:43.380 --> 06:44.380]  Keep it coming.
[06:44.380 --> 06:45.780]  Bro, I will do my best.
[06:45.780 --> 06:47.500]  Thank you for noticing.
[06:47.500 --> 06:51.940]  It says, with your help and let me try that again without the frog in my throat.
[06:51.940 --> 06:57.020]  It says, with your help and some dedication from myself, I landed a commercial cultivation
[06:57.020 --> 06:58.020]  job.
[06:58.020 --> 06:59.620]  Congratulations brother.
[06:59.620 --> 07:00.620]  You did the hard work.
[07:00.620 --> 07:03.140]  I just gave you some info and you put it to use.
[07:03.140 --> 07:06.560]  It says, as soon as I got in there, I hit the ground running.
[07:06.560 --> 07:11.300]  Your shows and my research have really helped me earn the respect of my team and people
[07:11.300 --> 07:15.540]  are always asking my opinion on things and how to grow in general.
[07:15.540 --> 07:19.220]  That is awesome but keep in mind, and we're going to get to more of this in the message
[07:19.220 --> 07:23.660]  here, that they hired you, you didn't hire them so you got to go by their way but if
[07:23.660 --> 07:27.340]  they're going to ask you for questions, always have good answers.
[07:27.340 --> 07:30.340]  It says, the job is tough though.
[07:30.340 --> 07:32.260]  Every day I see things we need to work on.
[07:32.260 --> 07:34.820]  That is the way a commercial grow is always going to go.
[07:34.820 --> 07:36.500]  I see that in my personal grows.
[07:36.500 --> 07:38.220]  I see that in commercial grows.
[07:38.220 --> 07:41.300]  There are always going to be things for somebody to work on.
[07:41.300 --> 07:42.300]  Always room for improvement.
[07:42.300 --> 07:45.660]  The fact that you see it means that you're aware that you're not turning a blind eye
[07:45.660 --> 07:48.220]  to it, that you know there's room for improvement.
[07:48.220 --> 07:49.660]  That's always a good sign.
[07:49.660 --> 07:52.740]  Let's continue with this message because I am rambling today.
[07:52.740 --> 07:59.340]  It says, my biggest concern is that our plants are growing too quickly and too tall.
[07:59.340 --> 08:05.300]  I want to lay out some ideas for my boss to consider for controlling the stretch in flower.
[08:05.300 --> 08:08.380]  The plants are getting too fast, too tall and they're stretching in flower.
[08:08.380 --> 08:10.140]  That makes a lot of sense.
[08:10.140 --> 08:14.460]  Then it says, I feel like we are falling, let's see, there's more that I skipped.
[08:14.460 --> 08:16.500]  We do trellising in three layers.
[08:16.500 --> 08:17.900]  That makes sense.
[08:17.900 --> 08:19.300]  Most of it I do with another person.
[08:19.300 --> 08:22.820]  Yeah, it usually takes one or two people to throw out a big trellis on a big canopy.
[08:22.820 --> 08:27.060]  I feel like we are falling behind a lot because of the growth rates and lack of knowledge
[08:27.060 --> 08:31.220]  on plant work from some of the less experienced folks.
[08:31.220 --> 08:33.220]  The plants are growing real fast.
[08:33.220 --> 08:36.380]  They're growing quickly with a lot of vigor, but you're falling behind because the people
[08:36.380 --> 08:37.800]  can't keep up with the plants.
[08:37.800 --> 08:39.800]  That does make sense.
[08:39.960 --> 08:43.360]  Finally, we're using 1000 watt high pressure sodiums that hang at a set height.
[08:43.360 --> 08:44.880]  The same goes for the fans.
[08:44.880 --> 08:50.040]  I told my boss I heard the environment controls for calming things down under the dark period
[08:50.040 --> 08:51.760]  as well as adding blue spectrum.
[08:51.760 --> 08:54.180]  Yeah, that would help, but that's not going to help a lot.
[08:54.180 --> 08:56.520]  This is more of a scheduling issue.
[08:56.520 --> 08:59.960]  Wind burn and light burn are killing a good portion of our yields.
[08:59.960 --> 09:02.440]  You just turn down those fucking fans, dude.
[09:02.440 --> 09:03.600]  I want to help.
[09:03.600 --> 09:07.560]  I'd like to get some ammo for a serious conversation with my leadership to get us on the right
[09:07.560 --> 09:10.000]  track and have more consistent growth patterns in our rooms.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  I'm sure you want information, so hit me up.
[09:12.000 --> 09:13.920]  Okay, I've got a good idea of what's happening here.
[09:13.920 --> 09:16.020]  Your plants are just getting too tall.
[09:16.020 --> 09:19.320]  You did say you're using a three-tier trellis system.
[09:19.320 --> 09:21.720]  Is that first one, and I don't know what you're doing in there.
[09:21.720 --> 09:22.720]  I can't see.
[09:22.720 --> 09:23.720]  I haven't had pictures yet.
[09:23.720 --> 09:25.800]  Is that first one spreading the plants apart?
[09:25.800 --> 09:27.960]  Normally, our plants want to grow straight up.
[09:27.960 --> 09:31.960]  We put the trellis down to just imagine if your plants are growing straight up and you
[09:31.960 --> 09:33.960]  came from above and just dropped a net on them.
[09:33.960 --> 09:35.960]  They're just going to go down with the net.
[09:35.960 --> 09:39.240]  We want that effect with the net, but then we spread them out strategically.
[09:39.240 --> 09:40.240]  Use the net.
[09:40.240 --> 09:44.280]  Instead of having them grow straight up vertically, we want to make them grow horizontally a little
[09:44.280 --> 09:45.280]  bit.
[09:45.280 --> 09:46.680]  We spread them out with the net.
[09:46.680 --> 09:47.680]  Spread them out.
[09:47.680 --> 09:51.480]  Instead of just going straight up, you can use the net squares to bend the plant over
[09:51.480 --> 09:53.560]  and go over here into this square.
[09:53.560 --> 09:56.880]  Then it grows up that way, so you can fill up your space instead of going straight up.
[09:56.880 --> 09:59.040]  That's a way to get them shorter.
[09:59.040 --> 10:00.720]  That'll help you out a lot.
[10:00.720 --> 10:02.560]  The second net, you can do the same thing.
[10:02.560 --> 10:04.020]  Work them into that second net.
[10:04.020 --> 10:05.680]  Spread them out with the first one.
[10:05.680 --> 10:06.880]  Leave them into the second net.
[10:06.880 --> 10:08.440]  Then they'll grow up in the third one.
[10:08.440 --> 10:09.680]  They'll need supports for that.
[10:09.680 --> 10:12.520]  Don't be afraid to grab a branch.
[10:12.520 --> 10:17.600]  If my arm is the nug that's too tall, don't grab up at the wrist and bend the wrist down.
[10:17.600 --> 10:20.560]  Grab down at the elbow and pop that fucker at the elbow and bend it down to where it's
[10:20.560 --> 10:23.400]  horizontal and it will all grow back up.
[10:23.400 --> 10:27.700]  Don't be afraid to pop it down at the elbow area, crack it low, and then give it a lot
[10:27.700 --> 10:29.880]  of time to grow back up and curve itself up.
[10:29.880 --> 10:32.340]  It will grow back up.
[10:32.340 --> 10:35.640]  The main thing happening here is just a scheduling issue.
[10:35.640 --> 10:38.880]  If the plants are getting too big and too tall and they're growing into the lights and
[10:38.880 --> 10:41.720]  into the fans, you're probably vegging for too long.
[10:41.720 --> 10:43.760]  Why not just veg for less time?
[10:43.760 --> 10:46.400]  You could veg for a week less.
[10:46.400 --> 10:47.560]  That would save you money.
[10:47.560 --> 10:48.700]  That would save you time.
[10:48.700 --> 10:50.700]  That would save you a lot of things.
[10:50.700 --> 10:51.700]  Don't veg for so long.
[10:51.700 --> 10:53.500]  They're getting too tall.
[10:53.500 --> 10:54.500]  Get them shorter.
[10:54.500 --> 10:55.500]  You could put in blue lights.
[10:55.500 --> 10:56.500]  That would help you.
[10:56.500 --> 10:59.680]  The main thing is to just veg for a shorter period.
[10:59.680 --> 11:04.800]  A lot of popping and twisting, like between the time you flip and probably week three
[11:04.960 --> 11:05.960]  and four of flower.
[11:05.960 --> 11:07.800]  If you can pop and twist, that will help you a lot.
[11:07.800 --> 11:11.520]  That will stop them from growing vertically because they'll be spending more of their
[11:11.520 --> 11:15.480]  time and energy repairing what you've done to popping the cellulose structure.
[11:15.480 --> 11:16.560]  It won't mess up your buds.
[11:16.560 --> 11:18.200]  They're still transitioning.
[11:18.200 --> 11:20.680]  They're still going from the veg to the flower stage.
[11:20.680 --> 11:22.840]  The hormones are all changing over.
[11:22.840 --> 11:25.640]  Then like week four, five, and six, those nugs will really pack on.
[11:25.640 --> 11:29.400]  You can definitely pop and twist them, but this is more of a scheduling and planning
[11:29.400 --> 11:31.660]  issue, just flower earlier.
[11:31.660 --> 11:35.380]  My main question that I would ask now, you said that the plants are getting too tall.
[11:35.380 --> 11:37.340]  The main problem sounds like the plants are too tall.
[11:37.340 --> 11:40.780]  They're growing into the fans and they're growing into the lights.
[11:40.780 --> 11:43.020]  What week are they getting too tall?
[11:43.020 --> 11:48.140]  I'm assuming you're running a nine, probably a nine, maybe a 10, maybe an eight week flowering
[11:48.140 --> 11:49.140]  phase.
[11:49.140 --> 11:50.140]  I'm going to say nine weeks.
[11:50.140 --> 11:51.580]  We're at nine weeks.
[11:51.580 --> 11:53.220]  What week do you see them getting too tall?
[11:53.220 --> 11:55.480]  Is it week seven they start getting too tall?
[11:55.480 --> 11:57.060]  Week eight they get too tall?
[11:57.060 --> 12:01.640]  Whatever week they're getting too tall, reduce that many weeks off of your veg phase.
[12:01.640 --> 12:04.720]  If they're getting too tall at week seven, you're doing a nine week flower phase, take
[12:04.720 --> 12:06.400]  two weeks off of the veg phase.
[12:06.400 --> 12:08.360]  We can't cut time off the flowering phase.
[12:08.360 --> 12:09.640]  That's not possible.
[12:09.640 --> 12:14.020]  We've got to just cut time off somewhere else and that would be your veg phase.
[12:14.020 --> 12:17.120]  Why not just get them out of the cloner, get them into pots?
[12:17.120 --> 12:20.160]  It sounds like you might just get them right into fucking flower at this point.
[12:20.160 --> 12:21.160]  Get them trellised out.
[12:21.160 --> 12:24.560]  You get them out of the cloner, get them into probably their final pots.
[12:24.560 --> 12:27.760]  It sounds like from if you don't have a lot of time, I really don't know how long you're
[12:27.760 --> 12:32.200]  vegging, but get them into their final pots, top them, trellis them out, flower them.
[12:32.200 --> 12:33.200]  Boom.
[12:33.200 --> 12:34.200]  Turn and burn.
[12:34.200 --> 12:35.200]  There's no need to veg them for extra time.
[12:35.200 --> 12:39.160]  You're probably wasting time anyway if they're that tall or learn to spread them out more
[12:39.160 --> 12:40.360]  vertically.
[12:40.360 --> 12:45.200]  The blue lights would help you out, but it's not going to keep them that short and compact.
[12:45.200 --> 12:47.360]  Now, here's where the breeder part comes in.
[12:47.360 --> 12:49.520]  Are you growing the correct genetics?
[12:49.520 --> 12:53.320]  Maybe you need different genes in that room.
[12:53.320 --> 12:57.640]  If you're not running a basketball team, you're running a different team.
[12:57.720 --> 12:58.720]  Who's short?
[12:58.720 --> 12:59.720]  Maybe a soccer team.
[12:59.720 --> 13:02.360]  I don't know what sport would benefit from people being shorter, but on the basketball
[13:02.360 --> 13:04.560]  team you want the seven foot 10 guys.
[13:04.560 --> 13:07.760]  On the soccer team, maybe you got the five foot nine guys.
[13:07.760 --> 13:10.240]  Maybe you don't have room for the basketball team in your grow.
[13:10.240 --> 13:13.520]  Maybe you need to find some more soccer team mates in that grow.
[13:13.520 --> 13:17.120]  Maybe what I'm trying to say, some shorter squattier stuff that'll grow better for you.
[13:17.120 --> 13:20.640]  Maybe you don't want those 11 week sativas in that room anyway.
[13:20.640 --> 13:25.600]  Shorter flowering stuff that stays shorter probably would work better in that room.
[13:25.600 --> 13:27.300]  One thing I would say is genetics.
[13:27.960 --> 13:30.180]  Do you have the appropriate genetics in this room?
[13:30.180 --> 13:31.460]  Do you know those genetics?
[13:31.460 --> 13:34.820]  Have you grown them enough times to understand what makes them stretch?
[13:34.820 --> 13:35.980]  How long do they stretch?
[13:35.980 --> 13:37.220]  How long do they flower?
[13:37.220 --> 13:38.220]  Know your genetics.
[13:38.220 --> 13:40.540]  How long have you been running this stuff?
[13:40.540 --> 13:43.660]  Understand the stretch for each plant and then adjust your veg phase.
[13:43.660 --> 13:44.660]  I keep saying it.
[13:44.660 --> 13:46.300]  We can't change the flowering time.
[13:46.300 --> 13:49.340]  Adjust your veg phase to work more for these plants.
[13:49.340 --> 13:53.660]  If you're running out of space, two weeks before you're done, cut off two weeks.
[13:53.660 --> 13:56.540]  If you're running out of space three weeks, cut off three weeks.
[13:56.580 --> 13:58.940]  You can only do it at the veg end.
[13:58.940 --> 14:01.060]  You're going to have to figure out your timing there.
[14:01.060 --> 14:02.780]  Don't grow them so big.
[14:02.780 --> 14:03.780]  Maybe top them.
[14:03.780 --> 14:05.980]  Make them shorter before you go into flower.
[14:05.980 --> 14:09.900]  This is something that has to be done in veg.
[14:09.900 --> 14:12.740]  I do have some more notes here.
[14:12.740 --> 14:16.020]  One of my notes is you're not supposed to burn them until after you sell them.
[14:16.020 --> 14:18.820]  If they're growing into the lights, just make them shorter.
[14:18.820 --> 14:20.740]  We know that we can't raise the lights.
[14:20.740 --> 14:23.740]  We already know that we've got to have at least, depending on your lights, if you've
[14:23.740 --> 14:27.860]  got gavitas, you need two feet between the light and the canopy.
[14:27.860 --> 14:28.860]  Prepare for that.
[14:28.860 --> 14:29.940]  Are you growing on tables?
[14:29.940 --> 14:31.020]  Are you growing on the floor?
[14:31.020 --> 14:32.100]  Are you growing on pots?
[14:32.100 --> 14:34.500]  Is there anything we can adjust in that range?
[14:34.500 --> 14:36.740]  I really think it's a timing issue, though.
[14:36.740 --> 14:39.980]  Just start flowering sooner, so subtract some weeks.
[14:39.980 --> 14:44.820]  Of course, I understand that you are a grow tech or something similar in that environment.
[14:44.820 --> 14:46.700]  There's probably a lead grower.
[14:46.700 --> 14:50.700]  Then there is probably a manager of the facility or something.
[14:50.700 --> 14:51.860]  Then there's probably an owner.
[14:51.980 --> 14:53.940]  They probably have investors.
[14:53.940 --> 14:57.020]  Probably a bunch of people arguing over what to do.
[14:57.020 --> 14:58.740]  It sounds like you've identified the problem.
[14:58.740 --> 15:03.900]  The plants are growing into the lights and into the fans, which is basically a scheduling
[15:03.900 --> 15:05.100]  issue.
[15:05.100 --> 15:07.100]  You know they're going to keep growing.
[15:07.100 --> 15:08.140]  You know they're going to get bigger.
[15:08.140 --> 15:09.780]  They're not going to stop doing it.
[15:09.780 --> 15:14.340]  I think the solution is to flower earlier.
[15:14.340 --> 15:15.340]  Maybe send me some pictures.
[15:15.340 --> 15:16.340]  Send me some videos.
[15:16.340 --> 15:17.340]  Let me know what's going on.
[15:17.340 --> 15:18.900]  Maybe I can send you an update.
[15:18.900 --> 15:21.840]  The solution is flower sooner.
[15:21.840 --> 15:23.720]  Maybe more smaller plants.
[15:23.720 --> 15:28.480]  Instead of growing a bunch of really tall plants, grow a whole bunch of really small
[15:28.480 --> 15:29.480]  plants.
[15:29.480 --> 15:30.480]  That may be the way to do it for you.
[15:30.480 --> 15:31.920]  You've got less veg time.
[15:31.920 --> 15:33.400]  Just put more plants in there.
[15:33.400 --> 15:35.360]  That way they don't have to get as tall.
[15:35.360 --> 15:36.640]  You just fill the space more.
[15:36.640 --> 15:37.840]  Is your canopy full?
[15:37.840 --> 15:40.000]  That's one of the most important things to think about.
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.000]  Is the canopy full?
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.240]  If you've got super tall, stretchy plants and the canopy is not full, you're wasting
[15:45.240 --> 15:46.240]  a lot of space.
[15:46.240 --> 15:48.080]  Also, you've got 1,000 watt lights in there.
[15:48.080 --> 15:49.080]  Do you have enough lights?
[15:49.080 --> 15:51.640]  Because if you have enough, they won't be so stretchy.
[15:52.440 --> 15:53.440]  Think about the genetics.
[15:53.440 --> 15:54.440]  Think about the kind of light.
[15:54.440 --> 15:55.920]  Think about do you have enough light.
[15:55.920 --> 15:58.200]  Think about the spectrum.
[15:58.200 --> 16:00.000]  Then properly pop and twist.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.520]  Honestly, though, this is a timing issue.
[16:02.520 --> 16:04.080]  Maybe run a bunch of smaller plants.
[16:04.080 --> 16:05.080]  All right.
[16:05.080 --> 16:06.080]  Hey, bro.
[16:06.080 --> 16:07.080]  Thank you for the great message.
[16:07.080 --> 16:10.720]  I did not say your name just because I don't want to get you in any trouble if the work
[16:10.720 --> 16:13.760]  hears this and you're not prepared to talk to them or whatever.
[16:13.760 --> 16:15.000]  But bro, thank you for the great message.
[16:15.000 --> 16:16.000]  All right.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  I'm going to move on to another message.
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.600]  This one comes from ... Oh, this is from our buddy, SlightlyStone.
[16:21.600 --> 16:23.160]  What's up, buddy?
[16:23.160 --> 16:25.120]  I'm SlightlyStone to stupid as well.
[16:25.120 --> 16:27.160]  It's been a great day.
[16:27.160 --> 16:29.600]  I got these bright ass lights in my face.
[16:29.600 --> 16:31.760]  When you take some fat dabs, you get these bright lights in your face.
[16:31.760 --> 16:33.680]  It's like you're extra blazed, which is really great.
[16:33.680 --> 16:36.080]  Shout out to my buddy, SlightlyStone to stupid.
[16:36.080 --> 16:40.280]  They sent a question that said, maybe you could talk about CO2 levels and what they
[16:40.280 --> 16:46.360]  should be at pre-harvest in a CO2 enriched grow, I'm asking, because I have a perpetual
[16:46.360 --> 16:48.960]  harvest going in one big flower room.
[16:48.960 --> 16:51.240]  A few plants come down every week.
[16:51.880 --> 16:54.880]  Is it bad to have CO2 levels around 12 to 1500?
[16:54.880 --> 16:55.880]  All right.
[16:55.880 --> 16:58.840]  So, I do understand the question.
[16:58.840 --> 17:02.480]  Most of the time, we would crank up the CO2 to certain levels depending on the stage of
[17:02.480 --> 17:06.820]  veg or flower in which we are in, but our friend, SlightlyStone to stupid here is running
[17:06.820 --> 17:08.520]  a perpetual space.
[17:08.520 --> 17:13.680]  So sometimes they may have plants at week nine, possibly week seven, possibly week six,
[17:13.680 --> 17:15.160]  possibly four, two.
[17:15.160 --> 17:19.040]  I don't know the rotation and the scheduling, but I know they're in different stages, which
[17:19.040 --> 17:24.000]  makes a lot of sense and is a very good idea that we've got a constant supply of medicine
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.400]  and you don't always have to trim a whole bunch of herb.
[17:26.400 --> 17:27.680]  I like this.
[17:27.680 --> 17:33.040]  Their main concern is, is the high CO2 level going to have a problem with plants that are
[17:33.040 --> 17:36.160]  further into flower, plants that are not as far into flower?
[17:36.160 --> 17:39.040]  Are all of the plants going to be happy with the augmented CO2?
[17:39.040 --> 17:46.080]  My answer is, your 12 to 1500 particles per million of CO2 is fucking perfect, bro.
[17:46.080 --> 17:47.080]  That's ideal.
[17:47.080 --> 17:48.080]  That's beautiful.
[17:48.120 --> 17:50.080]  That's getting right in the sweet spot.
[17:50.080 --> 17:52.320]  If you have enough light, they are going to love that.
[17:52.320 --> 17:54.680]  If you don't have enough light, that may be overdoing it.
[17:54.680 --> 17:56.680]  It may be honestly just a waste.
[17:56.680 --> 18:00.680]  If they don't have enough light going on with that CO2, they can't use the CO2.
[18:00.680 --> 18:04.840]  It will be a way they won't be able to photosynthesize anyway, so they'll be taking in the extra
[18:04.840 --> 18:08.080]  CO2 and they'll be like, ah, if we just had some light, we could go fast.
[18:08.080 --> 18:13.760]  So as long as you got enough light in there to go with that CO2, they're going to love
[18:13.760 --> 18:14.760]  that.
[18:14.960 --> 18:18.400]  Let's talk a little bit more about CO2 since we're on this topic here.
[18:18.400 --> 18:25.400]  1200 to 2000 particles per million is ideal, depending on the stage you're in.
[18:25.400 --> 18:30.440]  Most commercial environments, I try to hit about 1400 ppms in flower.
[18:30.440 --> 18:33.760]  The owners say stay at 1000 because the shit's expensive.
[18:33.760 --> 18:35.560]  The consultants say hit 15.
[18:35.560 --> 18:40.040]  1250 to 1400 is ideal where you want to go for it in a commercial environment.
[18:40.040 --> 18:42.600]  CO2 can get expensive.
[18:42.600 --> 18:45.640]  Over 2000 particles per million is excessive.
[18:45.640 --> 18:48.160]  I don't think the plants can even take over 18.
[18:48.160 --> 18:49.160]  Definitely not over 2000.
[18:49.160 --> 18:51.880]  Maybe they can, but I don't think it's going to be cost effective.
[18:51.880 --> 18:55.200]  I think you're going to get weird stuff happening after that.
[18:55.200 --> 18:58.520]  3000 particles per million is dangerous for humans.
[18:58.520 --> 19:03.640]  So once you get that 3000 particles per million of CO2 in the air, for a human it gets dangerous.
[19:03.640 --> 19:05.440]  It'll start making you feel dizzy, lightheaded.
[19:05.440 --> 19:06.440]  It'll fuck you up.
[19:06.440 --> 19:09.000]  It'll definitely start causing problems for the plants.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.400]  5000 ppms is fatal.
[19:11.400 --> 19:14.160]  We're all going to die.
[19:14.160 --> 19:15.920]  Try not to get above that 2k.
[19:15.920 --> 19:19.960]  I think you're doing great with your 12 to 15, but if you've got the ability to crank
[19:19.960 --> 19:22.600]  it up, don't go much higher than 18 to 2000.
[19:22.600 --> 19:24.080]  It's going to be fine.
[19:24.080 --> 19:30.000]  I try to hover, honestly in a commercial environment, we hover around 1000 to 1200 ppms.
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.440]  I try for that 1400, but the doors are open, the fans are running, the exhaust fans happen.
[19:35.440 --> 19:40.200]  The CO2 gets just shot right out of the ceiling sometimes in the room.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.640]  In most of the facilities where I'm working, we hover around 1000 to 1200 ppms is what
[19:45.640 --> 19:46.640]  we stay around.
[19:46.640 --> 19:51.760]  Again, 1400 would be ideal, but doors open, fucking cracks in the walls, all that shit.
[19:51.760 --> 19:52.760]  This shit gets away.
[19:52.760 --> 19:55.760]  Ambient, so I'm talking about augmented CO2.
[19:55.760 --> 20:00.800]  These are places where we are getting a ... In the commercial grows, we do it kind of fancy.
[20:00.800 --> 20:05.080]  We have a truck that shows up and loads up a bunch of tanks with CO2 and we've got machines
[20:05.080 --> 20:08.600]  inside the rooms that just disperse CO2 based on a monitor.
[20:09.240 --> 20:11.240]  That's augmented CO2.
[20:11.240 --> 20:15.440]  In most environments, like in this room right now, I don't have any CO2 augmentation or
[20:15.440 --> 20:16.560]  outside or whatever.
[20:16.560 --> 20:24.360]  It's probably around 400 to 450 particles per million of CO2 just naturally in the environment.
[20:24.360 --> 20:29.740]  When we crank it up to 1000 or 1200, we are tripling the natural CO2, which really gives
[20:29.740 --> 20:30.740]  the plants some turbo.
[20:30.740 --> 20:32.480]  It's like nitrous for the plants basically.
[20:32.480 --> 20:35.360]  It's CO2, but it is basically nitrous for the plants.
[20:35.360 --> 20:38.280]  You put them on turbo mode.
[20:38.320 --> 20:43.240]  It is ideal to gradually increase CO2 levels, but it's not required.
[20:43.240 --> 20:47.080]  You can, like if you just got the equipment, you just got the funding to do it, you can
[20:47.080 --> 20:48.880]  go in there and just blast those bitches up.
[20:48.880 --> 20:51.720]  Go from your ambient 400, go right up to 2000.
[20:51.720 --> 20:53.280]  If that's what you want to do, they'll make it.
[20:53.280 --> 20:54.280]  It'll happen.
[20:54.280 --> 20:55.280]  They'll survive.
[20:55.280 --> 20:58.640]  They'll thrive with that, but it would be more cost effective and it wouldn't be a problem
[20:58.640 --> 21:00.280]  to just slowly ramp it up.
[21:00.280 --> 21:03.200]  Start off just augmenting a little bit more and more every day.
[21:03.200 --> 21:04.480]  Have a CO2 monitor in there.
[21:04.480 --> 21:06.600]  If you're going to use CO2, have a monitor.
[21:06.600 --> 21:07.600]  Make sure it doesn't get too high.
[21:07.920 --> 21:10.320]  I mentioned before it can get dangerously high.
[21:10.320 --> 21:12.960]  That'll take a lot of CO2 to do that, but have a monitor.
[21:12.960 --> 21:16.320]  There are a lot of different ways to augment CO2 in a grow space.
[21:16.320 --> 21:21.360]  I usually do the canisters with the regulator and the monitor and the monitor sees how much
[21:21.360 --> 21:22.360]  CO2 is in the room.
[21:22.360 --> 21:25.040]  When it gets below a threshold, it knows to turn on the thing.
[21:25.040 --> 21:26.320]  It opens a solenoid.
[21:26.320 --> 21:27.720]  The CO2 blasts into the room.
[21:27.720 --> 21:29.280]  You run it through lines.
[21:29.280 --> 21:33.360]  Put the lines above the plants because the CO2 is heavier than oxygen, so it's going
[21:33.360 --> 21:35.600]  to fall down onto your plants.
[21:35.600 --> 21:39.920]  You put a fan down low blowing back up to push it back up and just cycle that air.
[21:39.920 --> 21:41.720]  Also, here's a random tip.
[21:41.720 --> 21:47.600]  A fan down low pointing up will help disrupt insects.
[21:47.600 --> 21:51.160]  Insects are trying to land on your leaves and hang out and make a little space there.
[21:51.160 --> 21:54.240]  If you've got a fan blowing up, those bugs don't want to land there.
[21:54.240 --> 21:55.240]  They're going, what the fuck?
[21:55.240 --> 21:56.280]  Why is the wind going up?
[21:56.280 --> 21:58.160]  The wind doesn't ever go up.
[21:58.160 --> 21:59.160]  They get confused.
[21:59.160 --> 22:00.440]  They don't want to hang out there.
[22:00.440 --> 22:05.640]  I like to do the canisters and a regulator and a monitor is the best way to do it.
[22:05.640 --> 22:07.640]  In my opinion, there are several other ways.
[22:07.640 --> 22:09.600]  You can put a burner in your grow space.
[22:09.600 --> 22:11.420]  A CO2 burner is very efficient.
[22:11.420 --> 22:12.680]  It does burn natural gas.
[22:12.680 --> 22:13.680]  It's always turned on.
[22:13.680 --> 22:14.680]  You get a little flame going.
[22:14.680 --> 22:16.160]  Get your CO2 going there.
[22:16.160 --> 22:18.200]  That is going to increase your heat.
[22:18.200 --> 22:19.520]  In some places, that's cool.
[22:19.520 --> 22:23.320]  In some places, that will not work for you at all.
[22:23.320 --> 22:28.800]  A lot of people do little mushroom kit bags and just CO2 bags and things.
[22:28.840 --> 22:33.960]  Depending on your space, I don't see the cost effectiveness of those unless you have a tiny,
[22:33.960 --> 22:35.160]  tiny space.
[22:35.160 --> 22:40.880]  If your space is that tiny, you're not really focused on CO2 augmentation anyway.
[22:40.880 --> 22:43.280]  That will work for you if you've got something tiny.
[22:43.280 --> 22:44.280]  There's a burner.
[22:44.280 --> 22:45.280]  There's a canister set up.
[22:45.280 --> 22:48.400]  Then there are all kinds of little mushroom bags that they sell.
[22:48.400 --> 22:52.440]  Some people will brew some wine or brew some beer and use that CO2 to augment the grow
[22:52.440 --> 22:54.200]  space as well.
[22:54.200 --> 22:55.200]  Double up.
[22:55.200 --> 22:56.200]  Double your pleasure.
[22:56.200 --> 22:57.200]  Double your fun.
[22:57.200 --> 22:58.200]  Don't overdo it.
[22:58.600 --> 23:02.880]  Plants can become immune to too much CO2.
[23:02.880 --> 23:03.880]  That's right.
[23:03.880 --> 23:05.400]  It's just like giving them too much drugs, bro.
[23:05.400 --> 23:11.040]  It's just like they'll start building a tolerance and then they won't perform if you start overdoing it.
[23:11.040 --> 23:14.800]  If you introduce it too soon, this is why I said it may be a good idea to slowly introduce
[23:14.800 --> 23:15.800]  them.
[23:15.800 --> 23:20.320]  If you go too hard too soon, they're like, oh, 1,800 ppms of CO2.
[23:20.320 --> 23:21.320]  Sweet.
[23:21.320 --> 23:22.320]  Thank you.
[23:22.320 --> 23:24.360]  They're going to start performing real hard, going real crazy.
[23:24.480 --> 23:29.160]  But six or eight weeks later, they're going to go, oh, 1,800 ppms of CO2.
[23:29.160 --> 23:30.160]  Cool.
[23:30.160 --> 23:31.680]  I'll grow kind of fast.
[23:31.680 --> 23:33.480]  They're not going to be as excited about it.
[23:33.480 --> 23:39.160]  So maybe introduce it slowly, build your way up, and then they will not get their immunity,
[23:39.160 --> 23:40.800]  so to speak, to the CO2.
[23:40.800 --> 23:42.560]  It will work better for them.
[23:42.560 --> 23:46.280]  One thing I will suggest because it is my responsibility is if you are going to augment
[23:46.280 --> 23:50.680]  CO2 in your environment, if you're going to use a burner, if you're going to use a canister,
[23:50.680 --> 23:52.120]  do have some sort of monitor in there.
[23:52.120 --> 23:55.320]  Do have some sort of way to let yourself know that CO2 is too high.
[23:55.320 --> 23:58.640]  It can be fatal if we get it in super high concentrations.
[23:58.640 --> 24:00.960]  So please don't die growing weed.
[24:00.960 --> 24:01.960]  We don't need that shit.
[24:01.960 --> 24:05.300]  That will not look good for the community, for the movement, for anything.
[24:05.300 --> 24:06.300]  And we love you.
[24:06.300 --> 24:07.300]  We need you here.
[24:07.300 --> 24:08.300]  So don't die growing weed.
[24:08.300 --> 24:09.300]  All right.
[24:09.300 --> 24:12.200]  My buddy Slightly Stoned Stupid, I want to thank you for the great Patreon message.
[24:12.200 --> 24:16.000]  If you've got any more questions, you know I would love to hear back from you.
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[24:20.720 --> 24:24.360]  gutters, pollen shuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there.
[24:24.360 --> 24:27.400]  I think this was a short episode, but I'm going to wrap it up.
[24:27.400 --> 24:30.240]  I think it is all about quality over quantity.
[24:30.240 --> 24:31.400]  I think this was a good show.
[24:31.400 --> 24:35.200]  I could ramble on and make it longer if you want, but what would be the point?
[24:35.200 --> 24:38.100]  You know, I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[24:38.100 --> 24:39.100]  Thank you again for listening.
[24:39.100 --> 24:43.160]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know I would love the feedback.
[24:43.160 --> 24:47.440]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[24:47.440 --> 24:50.000]  Don't forget about the Patreon at patreon.com.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.600]  And of course, please join us on Discord.
[24:52.600 --> 24:56.400]  Somewhere right now on Discord, someone's hanging out, having a conversation about some
[24:56.400 --> 25:01.760]  iri genetic strains, talking about growing weed in the mountains or smoking dabs with
[25:01.760 --> 25:02.760]  a mermaid.
[25:02.760 --> 25:06.480]  You never know what could be happening on the iri genetics Discord.
[25:06.480 --> 25:07.480]  Join us.
[25:07.480 --> 25:08.480]  We look forward to seeing you there.
[25:08.480 --> 25:11.380]  Also, now is a good time to like and subscribe.
[25:11.380 --> 25:15.240]  If you're watching this video and you enjoyed it, please do click like on the video.
[25:15.240 --> 25:16.960]  Of course, subscribe to the channel.
[25:16.960 --> 25:18.660]  Then there is a little notification bell.
[25:18.660 --> 25:20.500]  Click on that notification bell.
[25:20.500 --> 25:23.180]  Every time I put out a new episode, you will get notified.
[25:23.180 --> 25:24.480]  You'll never miss any content.
[25:24.480 --> 25:25.480]  We do put out the shows.
[25:25.480 --> 25:27.840]  It is Sunday night into Monday morning.
[25:27.840 --> 25:28.840]  That is midnight.
[25:28.840 --> 25:30.540]  It's 12 o'clock Monday morning.
[25:30.540 --> 25:31.700]  Does that make sense?
[25:31.700 --> 25:35.580]  And then also we put out the episodes Wednesday into Thursday at midnight.
[25:35.580 --> 25:39.760]  So that's 12 o'clock Thursday morning is technically what that is.
[25:39.760 --> 25:40.760]  Join us.
[25:40.760 --> 25:41.760]  We do the premieres live.
[25:41.760 --> 25:43.820]  The premieres pop out on YouTube at midnight.
[25:43.820 --> 25:46.740]  Most of the time I hang out in the live chat, hang out with the crew.
[25:46.740 --> 25:48.100]  I'm smoking dabs.
[25:48.220 --> 25:53.180]  I'm usually in the discord video chat and watching the video at the same time watching
[25:53.180 --> 25:54.180]  the chat.
[25:54.180 --> 25:56.720]  So I'm trying to be as interactive with the community as I can.
[25:56.720 --> 25:58.860]  Of course, that does happen at midnight.
[25:58.860 --> 26:00.540]  Sometimes I fall asleep and miss it.
[26:00.540 --> 26:01.980]  But join us on the premiere.
[26:01.980 --> 26:03.420]  We look forward to seeing you there.
[26:03.420 --> 26:04.420]  Please do like and subscribe.
[26:04.420 --> 26:06.740]  I got rambly there at the end of the show.
[26:06.740 --> 26:07.740]  Thank you guys for hanging out.
[26:07.740 --> 26:10.180]  You know I'll be back in a few days with fresh new content.
[26:10.180 --> 26:13.180]  Let's give a giant shout out to my buddy Yee Motherfucking Ha.
[26:13.180 --> 26:16.620]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
