[00:00.000 --> 00:01.760]  All right, what's up, podcast world?
[00:01.760 --> 00:05.400]  It is time for episode 448 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.400 --> 00:09.000]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.640]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:13.640 --> 00:18.960]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:18.960 --> 00:22.320]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:22.320 --> 00:27.640]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Tahoe Jam Fambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:27.640 --> 00:31.320]  This is a blend of Tahoe OG and Jam Band.
[00:31.320 --> 00:32.800]  The aroma is really funky.
[00:32.800 --> 00:34.800]  I'm cracking it open right now to get a fresh smell.
[00:34.800 --> 00:40.600]  It's got a immediately a gassy, dirty aroma right off the crack of the jar.
[00:40.600 --> 00:42.520]  Soon as I open it, there is a gassy smell.
[00:42.520 --> 00:44.920]  Then there is a rotten fruit sort of a thing on the background.
[00:44.920 --> 00:46.680]  I think it is delicious.
[00:46.680 --> 00:49.580]  The flavor is gassy and gross all at the same time.
[00:49.580 --> 00:51.680]  It coats your mouth so deliciously.
[00:51.680 --> 00:59.400]  The potency label says this product contains 72.9% THC and 84.4% total cannabinoids.
[00:59.400 --> 01:05.560]  I really like the Tahoe Jam Fambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:05.560 --> 01:08.720]  Big shout out to all of my friends over at Apothecary.
[01:08.720 --> 01:11.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be a quick Thursday episode.
[01:11.680 --> 01:15.600]  I've got an email from a friend that I want to read, so let's not waste a lot of time.
[01:15.600 --> 01:17.840]  Let's jump right into this email.
[01:17.840 --> 01:19.680]  This message goes just like this.
[01:19.680 --> 01:21.240]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[01:21.240 --> 01:24.520]  I found you through the Embracing Organics show.
[01:24.520 --> 01:29.360]  Just to keep people up to speed, I am part of another podcast called Embracing Organics.
[01:29.360 --> 01:30.700]  That show is on YouTube.
[01:30.700 --> 01:34.280]  It happens live every Thursday at 7 p.m. Mountain Time.
[01:34.280 --> 01:36.580]  It is hosted by my good friend Dirtman Dan.
[01:36.580 --> 01:38.860]  He invites me as a panelist.
[01:38.860 --> 01:42.000]  That show is mainly based on organically growing cannabis.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.440]  I know I'm not much of an organic farmer, but I do have plenty of opportunities to give
[01:46.440 --> 01:48.600]  a lot of good insight in that episode.
[01:48.600 --> 01:50.480]  We talk about the cannabis industry.
[01:50.480 --> 01:51.500]  We talk about breeding.
[01:51.500 --> 01:52.580]  We talk about smoking.
[01:52.580 --> 01:54.240]  We talk about cultivation.
[01:54.240 --> 01:55.960]  We talk a lot about cannabis.
[01:55.960 --> 02:02.840]  Anyway, I invite you to join us on the Embracing Organics show Thursdays on YouTube at 7 p.m.
[02:02.840 --> 02:03.840]  Mountain Time.
[02:03.840 --> 02:05.000]  I'm not sure your time zone.
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.100]  I know that I've got to be there at 7, so find out what time 7 p.m. Mountain Time is
[02:09.100 --> 02:10.600]  in your time zone.
[02:10.600 --> 02:13.920]  Join us on Thursdays for the Embracing Organics live show.
[02:13.920 --> 02:18.460]  Also, if you miss the show, all of the episodes are still available on YouTube.
[02:18.460 --> 02:20.900]  Just go to YouTube, type in Embracing Organics.
[02:20.900 --> 02:23.300]  You'll find an episode I'm sure you will enjoy.
[02:23.300 --> 02:27.100]  I am a guest on the Embracing Organics show every Thursday, and that is where our friend
[02:27.100 --> 02:28.100]  found me.
[02:28.100 --> 02:32.860]  He goes on to say, I found you via Stabby McStabberson, who spoke highly of your work
[02:32.860 --> 02:34.980]  and made me curious.
[02:34.980 --> 02:36.260]  Big shout out to my friend Stabby.
[02:36.260 --> 02:37.820]  Stabby is a great person, a great dude.
[02:37.820 --> 02:41.380]  He is also a panelist on the Embracing Organics show.
[02:41.380 --> 02:45.020]  We have become quite good friends lately, and it's good to hear that Stabby is speaking
[02:45.020 --> 02:46.780]  well of me.
[02:46.780 --> 02:50.940]  The message goes on, it says, I don't have money to support you on Patreon or buy your
[02:50.940 --> 02:55.980]  seeds, but I would like to support by giving some grow tips of my own, which I have picked
[02:55.980 --> 03:00.620]  up and I felt could help you out if you have not heard them yet.
[03:00.620 --> 03:02.580]  So my new friend here wants to support the show.
[03:02.580 --> 03:05.140]  He is not in a position to financially contribute to the show.
[03:05.140 --> 03:09.640]  He is not in a situation where he needs seeds, so he is doing his giving back by sending
[03:09.640 --> 03:11.460]  us some useful advice.
[03:11.460 --> 03:15.820]  I thought I would share this advice with you guys, and here are some tips sent in by our
[03:15.860 --> 03:17.300]  friend.
[03:17.300 --> 03:22.740]  Tip number one is Swarovski predator mites can get expensive and need to be reapplied.
[03:22.740 --> 03:27.260]  I talk quite often about using Swarovski predator mites as part of my integrated pest management.
[03:27.260 --> 03:29.180]  Yes, they do need to be reapplied.
[03:29.180 --> 03:31.900]  It does take some time to establish colonies.
[03:31.900 --> 03:33.980]  This email comes with some great advice.
[03:33.980 --> 03:40.740]  It says, if you grow banker plants or companion plants, such as poinsettias, and place a few
[03:40.740 --> 03:45.700]  between each plant in the veg and flower room, the Swarovskis will feed on the pollen
[03:45.700 --> 03:50.080]  from the pepper plants until your bad bugs arrive or return.
[03:50.080 --> 03:54.580]  So if you have released Swarovskis in your grow, eventually they're going to eat all
[03:54.580 --> 03:55.860]  of the bad mites.
[03:55.860 --> 03:59.220]  Hopefully, in theory, they're going to get in there and they are going to eradicate all
[03:59.220 --> 04:01.340]  of the intrusive spider mites.
[04:01.340 --> 04:04.980]  At that point in time, those Swarovskis will go, hey, there's nothing here for me.
[04:04.980 --> 04:06.220]  I'm going to take off.
[04:06.220 --> 04:09.100]  And just like you, they're going to want to eat and they're going to want to get laid,
[04:09.100 --> 04:10.180]  so they're going to leave.
[04:10.180 --> 04:13.180]  They're going to go find a better opportunity to eat and get laid.
[04:13.180 --> 04:19.180]  If you have some poinsettia or pepper plants in your grow, those Swarovskis can feed off
[04:19.180 --> 04:20.180]  of the pollen.
[04:20.180 --> 04:24.660]  So they will have something to survive off of and you don't need bad bugs in your situation,
[04:24.660 --> 04:29.660]  in your environment, to continue to keep the populations of Swarovskis colonized in your
[04:29.660 --> 04:32.140]  facility or in your outdoor grow.
[04:32.140 --> 04:36.500]  So that is a very useful tip if you are trying to establish and keep colonies of Swarovskis
[04:36.500 --> 04:41.420]  around in your facility or in your outdoor grow, some poinsettias or some pepper plants
[04:41.420 --> 04:46.260]  will help them stick around because they can simply feed off of that pollen.
[04:46.260 --> 04:47.260]  Now this email continues.
[04:47.260 --> 04:50.500]  He said, I learned this from Psychangel on Instagram.
[04:50.500 --> 04:54.300]  Now Psychangel is an IPM specialist and an entomologist.
[04:54.300 --> 04:58.700]  And he says, I've seen my buddy's garden effectively maintaining his Swarovski population.
[04:58.700 --> 05:04.980]  Then he also says, female Swarovskis produce three times more when on a pollen diet.
[05:04.980 --> 05:09.220]  So you'll be able to increase your population quite quickly if you are feeding them the
[05:09.220 --> 05:10.220]  proper pollen.
[05:10.220 --> 05:14.860]  It goes on to say, the poinsettias make copious amounts of pollen, which you probably already
[05:14.860 --> 05:19.860]  know peppers won't pollinate cannabis plants and keep the good bugs around sort of like
[05:19.860 --> 05:24.180]  a barracks of soldiers waiting to deploy when the bad bugs come around.
[05:24.180 --> 05:26.100]  Yes, that is absolutely correct.
[05:26.100 --> 05:29.780]  The pollen from the poinsettias cannot pollinate your cannabis plants.
[05:29.780 --> 05:31.220]  So that's not anything to worry about.
[05:31.220 --> 05:32.500]  I'm sure somebody was thinking that.
[05:32.500 --> 05:33.900]  I'm glad you corrected that.
[05:34.020 --> 05:35.300]  Then yes, you were correct.
[05:35.300 --> 05:39.860]  Then we've got a barracks of soldiers waiting to deploy for when the bad bugs, if the bad
[05:39.860 --> 05:45.000]  bugs do decide to come back around, then we don't need to worry about building our population.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.700]  It is already there, ready to go.
[05:46.700 --> 05:48.220]  You've got the troops all lined up.
[05:48.220 --> 05:49.780]  They're just waiting for the signal.
[05:49.780 --> 05:52.860]  They're just waiting for the little bell so they could slide down the pole like firemen
[05:52.860 --> 05:55.580]  and just get out there and start destroying shit.
[05:55.580 --> 05:56.580]  Keeps on going.
[05:56.580 --> 06:00.880]  It says, Swarovskis are an excellent generalist and will actually eat nearly all cannabis
[06:00.880 --> 06:01.880]  pests.
[06:01.880 --> 06:03.500]  Yes, that's absolutely correct.
[06:03.940 --> 06:07.700]  That is why I like the Swarovskis in almost all commercial grows.
[06:07.700 --> 06:12.860]  I use them outside in some environments and I even use them in small caregiver, personal,
[06:12.860 --> 06:14.780]  private grow situations.
[06:14.780 --> 06:17.140]  So big thank you for grow tip number one.
[06:17.140 --> 06:21.180]  If you guys out there would like to keep your Swarovski populations up, this person recommends
[06:21.180 --> 06:24.500]  adding a poinsettia plant to the room and letting it pollinate.
[06:24.500 --> 06:29.740]  And those Swarovskis can live off of that pollen while the bad bugs are sparse.
[06:29.740 --> 06:32.100]  Now let's move on to grow tip number two.
[06:32.100 --> 06:33.100]  This is a good one.
[06:33.100 --> 06:39.500]  It says, if seeds don't crack after 48 hours in a paper towel, you can use a seed cracker.
[06:39.500 --> 06:41.100]  Okay, let's talk about that.
[06:41.100 --> 06:43.820]  When I germinate seeds, I recommend folding a paper towel.
[06:43.820 --> 06:46.100]  You fold it once, you fold it twice, maybe once more.
[06:46.100 --> 06:47.560]  Then you soak it with water.
[06:47.560 --> 06:48.620]  That's the way I do it.
[06:48.620 --> 06:49.620]  Then I unfold it.
[06:49.620 --> 06:51.220]  I put the seeds about in the center of that.
[06:51.220 --> 06:52.980]  Then I fold it all back up.
[06:52.980 --> 06:56.700]  And then I will either set that on a plate in a room where I can pay attention to it,
[06:56.700 --> 07:00.040]  or if I'm leaving, I will put it in a baggie and seal the baggie.
[07:00.040 --> 07:03.280]  The purpose for putting it in the baggie and sealing it is now I have kept the moisture
[07:03.280 --> 07:04.280]  in there.
[07:04.280 --> 07:05.480]  That moisture can't disappear.
[07:05.480 --> 07:09.080]  If I'm gone for longer than expected, those seeds will not dry up and die.
[07:09.080 --> 07:13.680]  We've talked on a previous episode about how my stoned ass germinated a bunch of expensive
[07:13.680 --> 07:17.840]  seeds, went to work, came home, went to bed, woke up in the middle of the night and realized
[07:17.840 --> 07:19.240]  I just killed a bunch of seeds.
[07:19.240 --> 07:22.920]  Had I put them in a baggie, that probably would not have happened.
[07:22.920 --> 07:27.000]  So I like to fold a paper towel, soak the paper towel, either put it in a baggie or
[07:27.000 --> 07:28.000]  put it on a plate.
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.000]  Then you wait.
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.200]  I like to unfold that paper towel every 12, 8 hours or so and check on it.
[07:33.200 --> 07:36.440]  See if I've got any tails coming out of my seeds.
[07:36.440 --> 07:39.680]  Most of the time, those seeds will sprout within 24 hours.
[07:39.680 --> 07:40.680]  They'll start making little tails.
[07:40.680 --> 07:44.880]  They'll look like a little sperm or a little worm and they'll start growing.
[07:44.880 --> 07:46.600]  Sometimes that doesn't happen.
[07:46.600 --> 07:49.360]  Sometimes you get a dud and it just doesn't crack.
[07:49.360 --> 07:55.320]  This guy says that you can use a seed cracker or you can also use scissors or a pair of
[07:55.320 --> 08:01.080]  mechanical humostats to squeeze the seed until it pops the shell, but no further.
[08:01.080 --> 08:07.600]  Now to be completely honest with you, I do not have any experience using a seed cracker.
[08:07.600 --> 08:11.960]  Anytime a seed has not germinated for me, I've thrown it away and called a dud and sprouted
[08:11.960 --> 08:14.920]  a new seed and hoped that that one worked.
[08:14.920 --> 08:18.720]  Seeds can be very delicate, but if you've already tried to soak it for 48 hours and
[08:18.720 --> 08:23.360]  it did not germinate, you don't have much to lose by giving it another shot by using
[08:23.360 --> 08:25.300]  some sort of a cracking method.
[08:25.300 --> 08:30.760]  So he says, once the shell's cracked, I've had 100% germination rate since trying the
[08:30.760 --> 08:32.200]  seed cracker.
[08:32.200 --> 08:38.760]  He also says, I saw a member of Coastal Seeds pop some 40-year-old seeds with the seed cracker.
[08:38.760 --> 08:42.840]  May not need to throw un-germed seeds out and start over if they don't pop right away.
[08:42.840 --> 08:44.400]  Yes, that is absolutely correct.
[08:44.400 --> 08:46.560]  This could be like a second chance.
[08:46.560 --> 08:50.680]  If you do your method for germinating seeds however you do it, if you soak them, if you
[08:50.680 --> 08:53.880]  put them in a paper towel, if you put them in a rapid rooter, if you just bury them straight
[08:53.880 --> 08:57.500]  in the dirt and it doesn't work, you can dig it up, you can take it out of the paper
[08:57.500 --> 09:02.520]  towel and this is another last ditch attempt to getting that seed to pop.
[09:02.520 --> 09:07.580]  Now I wouldn't personally do this or recommend this until it's been at least 48 or 52 or
[09:07.580 --> 09:11.460]  60 something hours and you're sure that that seed isn't going to pop under your normal
[09:11.460 --> 09:12.460]  method.
[09:12.460 --> 09:14.740]  I would make sure that that seed has been properly moistened.
[09:14.740 --> 09:17.180]  I would make sure that it's not too cold.
[09:17.180 --> 09:18.180]  Cold seeds won't sprout.
[09:18.180 --> 09:21.060]  So if it's a little bit too cold, it won't do anything.
[09:21.060 --> 09:23.540]  If you make it warm enough, it should sprout.
[09:23.560 --> 09:25.920]  Right now it's the middle of the summer so it's not real cold.
[09:25.920 --> 09:28.520]  So I would just germinate my seeds here on the table.
[09:28.520 --> 09:32.160]  I would fold the paper towel up, I would soak it, put the seeds in there, maybe put it in
[09:32.160 --> 09:34.280]  the baggie, maybe not, depending on my schedule.
[09:34.280 --> 09:37.720]  Then I would just germinate those seeds right here at the table, right where I hang out.
[09:37.720 --> 09:40.640]  So I could check on them, I would see them, I wouldn't forget about them and they'd be
[09:40.640 --> 09:43.060]  just right here, part of my normal day.
[09:43.060 --> 09:47.520]  If it were the colder season and I couldn't keep the house warm like it is now, I would
[09:47.520 --> 09:51.160]  put that baggie with those seeds on top of my refrigerator.
[09:51.180 --> 09:56.180]  I think that heat from the top of the refrigerator is just enough heat to germinate seeds.
[09:56.180 --> 09:59.740]  Any warmer than that and you run the risk of burning those seeds.
[09:59.740 --> 10:02.600]  I've seen more people just roast seeds.
[10:02.600 --> 10:05.020]  I've seen more people make popcorn out of seeds.
[10:05.020 --> 10:09.340]  I've seen more people just kill seeds with a heat mat, with some sort of a heat source,
[10:09.340 --> 10:11.340]  than I've seen success with a heat mat.
[10:11.340 --> 10:12.660]  So I don't recommend that.
[10:12.660 --> 10:17.220]  They will ruin your seeds, unless it is really cold in your environment.
[10:17.220 --> 10:20.540]  I also don't like to pop seeds in a humidity dome.
[10:20.560 --> 10:21.720]  I don't like the dome on there.
[10:21.720 --> 10:23.480]  I think that makes them a little bit weak.
[10:23.480 --> 10:26.080]  I like to have them exposed as soon as they're growing out.
[10:26.080 --> 10:28.000]  That way they can get some wind on them.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.880]  That way they're not expecting a bunch of humidity.
[10:29.880 --> 10:34.520]  If you germinate a seed in a dome, it's expecting that domed condition.
[10:34.520 --> 10:36.800]  Then you have to slowly acclimate that clone.
[10:36.800 --> 10:40.120]  You have to let it realize, oh, I'm not going to have a dome for 15 minutes.
[10:40.120 --> 10:43.240]  And the next day you give it 30 minutes and you let it go for a couple of days and then
[10:43.240 --> 10:45.280]  you give it an hour and then you give it two hours.
[10:45.280 --> 10:47.540]  And then finally it's used to not having a dome.
[10:47.540 --> 10:51.040]  But I don't like starting a seed under a dome because then it expects it.
[10:51.040 --> 10:55.360]  Why not just start it in your normal grow environment where you've got the proper VPD,
[10:55.360 --> 10:58.440]  you've got a little bit of airflow going on, there's a little bit of wind in there.
[10:58.440 --> 11:01.840]  That airflow, that wind happening will give that plant some strength.
[11:01.840 --> 11:05.840]  Just imagine when I push you, if I just gently walked by you and shoved you by your shoulder,
[11:05.840 --> 11:09.320]  just as a buddy, not as an asshole, just nudged you on your shoulder, just jokingly, what's
[11:09.320 --> 11:10.320]  up bro?
[11:10.320 --> 11:11.320]  A little shoulder nudge.
[11:11.320 --> 11:15.120]  The first thing you do, you spread your feet so that you can get better balance.
[11:15.120 --> 11:20.020]  I feel like when we blow on a small plant, just a little bit of wind, it tips over a
[11:20.020 --> 11:22.460]  little bit and it goes, oh shit, I better get my footing.
[11:22.460 --> 11:25.920]  And I think it tries to reach out and it spreads its roots a little bit further and it makes
[11:25.920 --> 11:27.380]  it a little bit stronger.
[11:27.380 --> 11:30.260]  I think a little bit of a struggle makes everything stronger.
[11:30.260 --> 11:35.240]  If it's a plant, if it's a person, anything, a little bit of adversity, a little struggle.
[11:35.240 --> 11:36.340]  What happens when you lift weights?
[11:36.340 --> 11:38.100]  When you do some work, you come back stronger.
[11:38.100 --> 11:40.420]  I think the plants respond the same way.
[11:40.420 --> 11:42.940]  So I don't like starting my plants in a dome.
[11:42.940 --> 11:46.480]  And I certainly do not like starting my plants with a heat mat.
[11:46.480 --> 11:47.840]  I prefer the paper towel.
[11:47.840 --> 11:52.560]  I prefer the baggy and I prefer the top of the refrigerator if I'm going to use any heat
[11:52.560 --> 11:53.740]  at all.
[11:53.740 --> 11:58.880]  So do your best to set yourself up for success when you are germinating new or old seeds.
[11:58.880 --> 12:02.380]  If you find that your method does not work, you've got a backup plan.
[12:02.380 --> 12:03.380]  We can crack them.
[12:03.380 --> 12:06.160]  What were some of the ways that our friend mentioned we could crack them?
[12:06.160 --> 12:09.000]  There's a product called a seed cracker you can buy.
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.380]  He also said we can use a small pair of medical hemostats to gently squeeze the seed until
[12:15.380 --> 12:17.340]  it pops, but no further.
[12:17.340 --> 12:19.280]  He also said you can use scissors.
[12:19.280 --> 12:24.140]  If you use scissors, it is probably easier to use the part of the scissors closer to
[12:24.140 --> 12:26.760]  the handle than closer to the tip of the blade.
[12:26.760 --> 12:28.580]  There's just a thing about leverage.
[12:28.580 --> 12:30.380]  Closer to the handle, you're going to have a little more control.
[12:30.380 --> 12:31.820]  It'll be easier to pop it.
[12:31.820 --> 12:36.740]  So open the scissors real wide, put your seed down in there close to the handle, then gently
[12:36.740 --> 12:37.740]  squeeze.
[12:37.740 --> 12:38.740]  You'll feel a little crack.
[12:39.480 --> 12:41.400]  It won't take much pressure at all at that point.
[12:41.400 --> 12:42.720]  You'll feel a little pop.
[12:42.720 --> 12:44.720]  Now that seed has another chance.
[12:44.720 --> 12:46.560]  Go back, try to re-germinate it.
[12:46.560 --> 12:47.640]  It should sprout.
[12:47.640 --> 12:50.540]  And if not, that seed did not stand a chance in the beginning.
[12:50.540 --> 12:51.840]  So we've got another option.
[12:51.840 --> 12:52.840]  All right.
[12:52.840 --> 12:54.120]  So I want to thank you for that great tip.
[12:54.120 --> 12:55.800]  There is more to this email.
[12:55.800 --> 12:58.020]  It says, that is it for now.
[12:58.020 --> 13:01.680]  You may have posted these in an update, so I apologize if you have covered either topic.
[13:01.680 --> 13:02.680]  No, I have not.
[13:02.680 --> 13:05.280]  These were great topics, so thank you for the great tips.
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.860]  She says, I am about halfway through part three of the Grow Tip compilation episodes,
[13:09.860 --> 13:12.220]  and I wanted to write the email before I forgot.
[13:12.220 --> 13:16.420]  Hey, thank you for listening to that long Grow series, and thank you for sending the
[13:16.420 --> 13:17.420]  email.
[13:17.420 --> 13:20.900]  I hope that by the time this podcast comes up, you are all caught up so you get to hear
[13:20.900 --> 13:22.620]  this right when it comes out.
[13:22.620 --> 13:24.580]  There is just a little bit more to this message.
[13:24.580 --> 13:25.580]  We'll wrap it up.
[13:25.580 --> 13:28.540]  It says, love what you do and really enjoy the podcast.
[13:28.540 --> 13:31.180]  Also, I've been cultivating for over a decade.
[13:31.180 --> 13:35.960]  I like listening to your Grow Tips as I can always learn something new, even when reviewing
[13:35.960 --> 13:37.560]  basics sometimes.
[13:37.560 --> 13:41.920]  I'll always be pointing many new growers to this playlist as well, since it answers a
[13:41.920 --> 13:47.160]  lot of questions I get asked on Instagram on a daily basis.
[13:47.160 --> 13:49.120]  So he's saying, thanks for the podcast, man.
[13:49.120 --> 13:50.200]  Thank you for listening.
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.320]  He's been growing for over a decade and still learns things from this podcast.
[13:54.320 --> 13:55.320]  You know what?
[13:55.320 --> 13:56.760]  I was listening to somebody the other day.
[13:56.760 --> 13:58.840]  They were paying me to do consulting.
[13:58.840 --> 14:01.060]  They were paying me to give them advice.
[14:01.060 --> 14:04.140]  They said something that I said, holy shit, I've never thought of that.
[14:04.140 --> 14:07.860]  I pulled out my notebook and I just casually wrote it down just in my little notebook that
[14:07.860 --> 14:09.340]  I have for consultations.
[14:09.340 --> 14:12.900]  It looks like I was making a note on the facility or something, but I was making a note on something
[14:12.900 --> 14:16.900]  profound that that person had said that I had never said out loud or never thought of
[14:16.900 --> 14:18.340]  or never heard before.
[14:18.340 --> 14:20.820]  I was like, hold, that's really good information.
[14:20.820 --> 14:22.580]  They were paying me to be there.
[14:22.580 --> 14:26.140]  So never think that you can't learn something from anybody.
[14:26.140 --> 14:30.400]  There's a brand new grower out there that read a book that you didn't read and one sentence
[14:30.400 --> 14:33.160]  that was really important stood out to him and you didn't read that book.
[14:33.160 --> 14:36.720]  He's going to say that sentence one day and you're going to go, holy shit, that person
[14:36.720 --> 14:39.880]  that I thought was stupid knows some shit and I'm impressed.
[14:39.880 --> 14:42.140]  So always keep an open mind.
[14:42.140 --> 14:46.160]  Our friend here has been growing for over a decade and still finds nuggets of useful
[14:46.160 --> 14:49.000]  information in my little podcast.
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.600]  Then he mentions reviewing basics.
[14:50.600 --> 14:53.660]  Yes, sometimes reviewing the basics is very important.
[14:53.660 --> 14:57.300]  Like I've mentioned in a previous episode, we had somebody with a grow room issue.
[14:57.300 --> 15:01.460]  They thought they needed a giant consultation when all they really needed was to take some
[15:01.460 --> 15:06.580]  time and maybe buy a small piece of equipment and find out what was happening in the grow.
[15:06.580 --> 15:08.300]  So yes, remember the basics.
[15:08.300 --> 15:11.240]  You can't build anything without a solid foundation.
[15:11.240 --> 15:12.700]  So don't forget the basics.
[15:12.700 --> 15:17.300]  Then he says he's going to share the playlist with his friends and people on Instagram because
[15:17.300 --> 15:19.540]  he has asked questions on a daily basis.
[15:19.540 --> 15:20.540]  I appreciate that.
[15:20.540 --> 15:24.780]  I hope I get a lot of new listeners from you and I hope I am able to help you and a lot
[15:24.780 --> 15:26.780]  of your grow friends.
[15:26.780 --> 15:29.460]  He wraps up the message by saying, thanks for all that you do.
[15:29.460 --> 15:30.460]  Keep up the great work.
[15:30.460 --> 15:34.860]  I've taken many fat dabs and given my mom lots of hugs for you.
[15:34.860 --> 15:35.860]  I appreciate that.
[15:35.860 --> 15:37.020]  That is super cool of you.
[15:37.020 --> 15:39.500]  He signs it with Jack Greenstock.
[15:39.500 --> 15:41.620]  So hey, Jack Greenstock, thank you for the great message.
[15:41.620 --> 15:44.180]  It sounds like Jack has got a podcast also.
[15:44.180 --> 15:45.660]  Make sure you guys look for that.
[15:45.660 --> 15:48.580]  I'm going to give that one a listen as soon as I am done with this show.
[15:48.580 --> 15:51.780]  I'm circling that right here on this paper and putting it right in front of me so I remember
[15:51.780 --> 15:52.780]  to do so.
[15:52.780 --> 15:55.320]  Once again, big shout out to my friend, Jack Greenstock.
[15:55.320 --> 15:56.740]  Thank you for the great email.
[15:56.740 --> 15:58.040]  Thank you for the great tips.
[15:58.040 --> 16:00.140]  Thank you for sharing the show with your friends.
[16:00.140 --> 16:03.900]  And of course, thank you for listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[16:03.900 --> 16:08.980]  All right, podcast world, I've got one more email right here in front of me for this episode.
[16:08.980 --> 16:12.020]  This one comes from, they've said their name multiple times in the message.
[16:12.020 --> 16:14.900]  We're just going to call them C because it doesn't say if they want their name said or
[16:14.900 --> 16:15.900]  not.
[16:15.900 --> 16:16.900]  It says, what's up?
[16:16.900 --> 16:17.900]  My name is C and I'm from...
[16:18.220 --> 16:20.580]  Yeah, we're not going to say your name and your location, both.
[16:20.580 --> 16:21.580]  That's a little too much.
[16:21.580 --> 16:25.460]  But our friend is from a place and he says, I recently started growing with my dad.
[16:25.460 --> 16:30.020]  We have a few plants right now that look great and have turned out pretty well so far.
[16:30.020 --> 16:34.120]  I've worked at a plant nursery for the past few years and have always had a fascination
[16:34.120 --> 16:36.860]  with plants, specifically cannabis.
[16:36.860 --> 16:41.420]  I've been listening to your podcast for some time now and I have a few questions that hopefully
[16:41.420 --> 16:42.420]  you can answer.
[16:42.420 --> 16:43.420]  Well, here we go.
[16:43.420 --> 16:48.380]  It says, I am currently studying business and I would like to change my major to agriculture
[16:48.380 --> 16:50.460]  and or agronomy.
[16:50.460 --> 16:55.420]  What field of study would best fit someone who is looking to pursue a career in cultivating
[16:55.420 --> 16:56.660]  cannabis?
[16:56.660 --> 17:01.460]  Secondly, what steps did you take when you first started breeding and cultivating that
[17:01.460 --> 17:04.660]  have brought you to the point where you are right now?
[17:04.660 --> 17:06.180]  I'd love to hear back from you.
[17:06.180 --> 17:08.700]  Keep up the bomb ass podcast.
[17:08.700 --> 17:10.740]  Thanks, C.
[17:10.820 --> 17:15.980]  Our friend C is currently studying business and would like to change their major to agriculture
[17:15.980 --> 17:16.980]  or agronomy.
[17:16.980 --> 17:22.100]  They are seeking advice on what field of study I think would best fit for somebody who is
[17:22.100 --> 17:26.500]  looking to pursue a career in cultivating cannabis.
[17:26.500 --> 17:27.940]  That's a great question.
[17:27.940 --> 17:33.300]  I don't have a clear cut answer because there are so many different aspects to the cannabis
[17:33.300 --> 17:40.180]  industry that I think having your business education will be more useful than any type
[17:40.180 --> 17:43.180]  of other education I could recommend.
[17:43.180 --> 17:45.100]  You have a passion for plants.
[17:45.100 --> 17:47.500]  You've already got nursery experience.
[17:47.500 --> 17:52.820]  Unless you plan to enter a facility as an owner or a lead grower, you were already on
[17:52.820 --> 17:53.820]  the right path.
[17:53.820 --> 17:59.380]  You've got just enough experience in a plant nursery and you've got a fascination for plants,
[17:59.380 --> 18:04.180]  specifically cannabis, where as a candidate for me to hire, that makes you a great starting
[18:04.180 --> 18:05.180]  grower.
[18:05.180 --> 18:08.820]  You're the kind of person I want to put on watering plants and I pay attention to if
[18:08.820 --> 18:12.740]  you can follow directions for a couple of weeks and then I give you a few more tasks.
[18:12.740 --> 18:13.940]  You sound like a smart person.
[18:13.940 --> 18:16.060]  You sound like you can handle that stuff.
[18:16.060 --> 18:20.080]  So trying to aim you or point you toward the direction of an agriculture or an agronomy
[18:20.080 --> 18:23.460]  type of a school or an education doesn't seem necessary.
[18:23.460 --> 18:28.020]  You're going to learn that and pick that up along the way by being there.
[18:28.020 --> 18:31.940]  What the industry is lacking is business minded people.
[18:31.940 --> 18:34.380]  It sounds like you probably want to get into the grow.
[18:34.380 --> 18:36.060]  You probably want to play with some dirt.
[18:36.060 --> 18:39.380]  You probably want to cut some plants and pull some leaves.
[18:39.380 --> 18:45.100]  There are a lot of those people available and unfortunately the pay rate for those types
[18:45.100 --> 18:50.500]  of jobs is rapidly declining as the cost and price and value of cannabis declines.
[18:50.500 --> 18:54.540]  As cannabis becomes more regulated and more available, and you can just go to the store
[18:54.540 --> 18:58.140]  and get it anywhere around here, it's getting much cheaper.
[18:58.140 --> 19:01.820]  It is much more affordable for the consumer, but that means on the business end, there's
[19:01.820 --> 19:04.820]  no profit, which means the growers are getting paid less.
[19:04.860 --> 19:09.260]  The people who are making the money are on the management end, the consultants, the lead
[19:09.260 --> 19:15.620]  grower, I hate the term master grower, but that is just a name for the person in the
[19:15.620 --> 19:17.980]  building who is in charge of the grow.
[19:17.980 --> 19:20.420]  There are growers and then there is a master grower.
[19:20.420 --> 19:24.900]  It's the lead grower, the cultivation manager, that guy, he's the one making the money.
[19:24.900 --> 19:26.700]  The other people are grow techs.
[19:26.700 --> 19:30.660]  They're paid as hourly employees, but it's the management is where the money is.
[19:30.700 --> 19:34.820]  If you want to make money in the cannabis industry, you either need to own your facility
[19:34.820 --> 19:37.620]  or you need to be in the business end of it.
[19:37.620 --> 19:43.140]  Unless you are completely set on being in the cultivation side, I recommend you stick
[19:43.140 --> 19:46.900]  to the management aspect of the legal part of cannabis.
[19:46.900 --> 19:51.220]  There are many things we need administration type people for.
[19:51.220 --> 19:53.220]  Everybody needs a compliance officer.
[19:53.220 --> 19:57.740]  The compliance officer is the person who reads all of the rules and walks through the retail
[19:57.820 --> 20:02.900]  establishment, the cultivation establishment, the extraction establishment, and makes sure
[20:02.900 --> 20:07.580]  that that company is following all of the rules in case any of the inspecting departments
[20:07.580 --> 20:10.460]  may pop up because they can show up at any time.
[20:10.460 --> 20:13.220]  The marijuana enforcement division can show up any time.
[20:13.220 --> 20:14.860]  They don't need any announcements.
[20:14.860 --> 20:19.260]  They can walk in, knock on the door and say, hey, we want to inspect everything.
[20:19.260 --> 20:21.500]  And right now they inspect everything.
[20:21.500 --> 20:25.140]  If the department of agriculture decides they want to come do a surprise inspection today
[20:25.140 --> 20:27.860]  at your cultivation facility, guess what?
[20:27.860 --> 20:30.340]  Department of agriculture inspection happens today.
[20:30.340 --> 20:31.580]  They don't care how busy you are.
[20:31.580 --> 20:32.900]  They don't care what's happening.
[20:32.900 --> 20:33.900]  They need somebody.
[20:33.900 --> 20:38.900]  So a compliance officer is a great person to have in every single facility.
[20:38.900 --> 20:42.780]  It sounds like you would make, if you were talking about agronomy, it sounds like you
[20:42.780 --> 20:44.100]  were already ahead of the game.
[20:44.100 --> 20:45.700]  You understand agronomics.
[20:45.700 --> 20:48.220]  You already are thinking about where to be.
[20:48.220 --> 20:50.060]  It sounds like you were a forward thinking person.
[20:50.060 --> 20:54.980]  We should have you in some sort of a management position making strategies, thinking long-term
[20:54.980 --> 20:55.980]  moves.
[20:55.980 --> 20:59.020]  We need to get you out of the cultivation and get you up in the ivory towers with all
[20:59.020 --> 21:01.860]  the other people wearing suits, thinking about the direction of the company.
[21:01.860 --> 21:03.620]  We need you helping to drive the ship.
[21:03.620 --> 21:09.620]  So I do appreciate that you want to better yourself for the agriculture aspect.
[21:09.620 --> 21:11.540]  I think you're going to develop that.
[21:11.540 --> 21:16.300]  If you've got the passion and you're already working with plants, it's going to come naturally.
[21:16.300 --> 21:20.160]  Listen to my podcast, expose yourself to the garden, be in there.
[21:20.160 --> 21:22.820]  You will develop all of the skills you need rapidly.
[21:22.820 --> 21:26.620]  I could tell by the way you wrote this email, the way your punctuation is perfect, everything
[21:26.620 --> 21:27.620]  is spelled right.
[21:27.620 --> 21:28.620]  You're a smart person.
[21:28.620 --> 21:33.140]  Now, if you really insist on being in the grow, I think you are at just the right level
[21:33.140 --> 21:34.140]  to get started.
[21:34.140 --> 21:38.380]  Unless you're going to own your own facility, I think you were right at the right area for
[21:38.380 --> 21:40.140]  me to hire you.
[21:40.140 --> 21:42.620]  People that know too much are a pain in the ass to hire.
[21:42.620 --> 21:46.660]  I wouldn't want to hire somebody that was as experienced of a grower as myself.
[21:46.660 --> 21:50.260]  I had to find the correct words to say that in my head did not sound egotistical, but
[21:50.260 --> 21:55.500]  it would be hard to retrain me to grow the way I need me to grow in another facility,
[21:55.500 --> 21:56.940]  if that makes any sense.
[21:56.940 --> 21:59.300]  You don't have any bad habits that I have to break.
[21:59.300 --> 22:03.580]  You can come in just knowing just enough to be dangerous, and I can mold you into the
[22:03.580 --> 22:07.620]  grower that I need you to be so that we can all be successful in the facility.
[22:07.620 --> 22:12.000]  Now, if you do intend to be the lead grower, or if you want to own your own large-scale
[22:12.000 --> 22:19.380]  cultivation facility, there are probably large-scale commercial cultivation schools that will teach
[22:19.500 --> 22:22.420]  you about farming and about agriculture.
[22:22.420 --> 22:26.700]  All of that stuff will apply to your cannabis cultivation facility.
[22:26.700 --> 22:29.340]  Learn about Department of Agriculture rules and laws.
[22:29.340 --> 22:31.700]  Learn about pesticide rules and laws.
[22:31.700 --> 22:34.820]  Learn about basic greenhouse growing.
[22:34.820 --> 22:39.140]  All of that stuff will apply to cannabis, and as cannabis becomes a big industry, you
[22:39.140 --> 22:40.300]  will be ahead of the game.
[22:40.300 --> 22:44.020]  When you've got college degrees for that type of stuff, when it comes time to pay people
[22:44.020 --> 22:48.260]  and decide who gets the bigger jobs, that's when you get those opportunities if that's
[22:48.260 --> 22:49.580]  what you want to do.
[22:49.580 --> 22:53.700]  I apologize that I don't know which classes to tell you to take or which schools to go
[22:53.700 --> 22:54.700]  to.
[22:54.700 --> 22:55.860]  I did not do that stuff.
[22:55.860 --> 23:00.060]  That is a great way to segue into the second half of the question you asked.
[23:00.060 --> 23:04.340]  The second part of the question is, what steps did you take when you first started breeding
[23:04.340 --> 23:09.340]  and cultivating to have brought you to the point where you are now?
[23:09.340 --> 23:15.220]  You know, I don't think I saw this path ahead of me when I started cultivating and breeding.
[23:15.220 --> 23:19.100]  It all happened in small steps just like it was supposed to.
[23:19.100 --> 23:22.180]  I don't talk about this a lot, and I'm not sure if I've ever said this on the show, but
[23:22.180 --> 23:26.860]  when I was a very small child, I had family members illegally growing cannabis in our
[23:26.860 --> 23:29.260]  backyard in California.
[23:29.260 --> 23:30.500]  It's way long ago.
[23:30.500 --> 23:33.660]  Nobody can get in trouble for that shit now, but I might have been seven or eight years
[23:33.660 --> 23:36.460]  old when I remember growing these plants.
[23:36.460 --> 23:41.980]  And I remember one of my uncles telling my other uncle, hey, tonight, before it gets
[23:41.980 --> 23:44.400]  dark, make sure you do this to these plants.
[23:44.400 --> 23:45.400]  And then he left.
[23:45.400 --> 23:46.460]  My uncle was like, sure, dude.
[23:46.460 --> 23:47.880]  And the day went on.
[23:47.880 --> 23:51.640]  Later on that evening, it was going to get dark, and my family was having a conversation,
[23:51.640 --> 23:54.680]  and my uncle said, shit, I got to go out there and do these to the weed plants.
[23:54.680 --> 23:56.000]  And he said it wrong.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.800]  And I said, no, dude, he said to do this.
[23:58.800 --> 24:01.440]  And everybody looked at me and they said, shit, he's right.
[24:01.440 --> 24:03.020]  That's what they said to do.
[24:03.020 --> 24:05.040]  And so I kind of saved the crop as a little kid.
[24:05.040 --> 24:07.720]  I remember that kind of vividly in my head.
[24:07.720 --> 24:11.520]  And I wasn't allowed to touch the plants then, but I was out there every time.
[24:11.520 --> 24:14.600]  If they were out there watering or doing something, I was out there with those ganja
[24:14.600 --> 24:15.600]  plants.
[24:15.600 --> 24:16.600]  I was a little tiny kid.
[24:16.600 --> 24:18.680]  They probably tried to keep me out of it, but that was my house.
[24:18.680 --> 24:19.680]  That was my yard.
[24:19.680 --> 24:21.800]  You know how the little kids just run shit?
[24:21.800 --> 24:23.560]  You think that the little kids are not running shit?
[24:23.560 --> 24:24.560]  They are.
[24:24.560 --> 24:27.600]  They've got the ability and the freedom to be all over the yard, the front yard, the
[24:27.600 --> 24:30.980]  backyard, the top of the house, the back of the house, because it doesn't look weird.
[24:30.980 --> 24:34.520]  If you as an adult go play in that weird corner in the back of the yard, people notice you're
[24:34.520 --> 24:35.520]  there.
[24:35.520 --> 24:36.520]  Kids, nobody thinks it's weird.
[24:36.520 --> 24:37.520]  So that yard was mine.
[24:37.520 --> 24:38.520]  But I remember they're like seven.
[24:38.520 --> 24:39.680]  I was like seven.
[24:39.680 --> 24:41.480]  They were growing weed way back then.
[24:41.640 --> 24:44.560]  So that was my first step into cultivating.
[24:44.560 --> 24:48.600]  And then I was in another state where cannabis is still illegal.
[24:48.600 --> 24:50.840]  And I found out that a friend was growing.
[24:50.840 --> 24:52.520]  I accidentally discovered his grow.
[24:52.520 --> 24:54.040]  And I was like, hey bro, I can see your grow.
[24:54.040 --> 24:55.040]  And he was like, oh shit.
[24:55.040 --> 24:57.600]  And then he was like, well, since you saw it, can you help me?
[24:57.600 --> 25:00.600]  He was like, since you saw it, you obviously know what's going on, because it was pretty
[25:00.600 --> 25:01.600]  well hidden.
[25:01.600 --> 25:02.600]  I spotted it on accident.
[25:02.600 --> 25:03.600]  He had a light leak.
[25:03.600 --> 25:04.600]  I saw the light leak.
[25:04.600 --> 25:05.600]  It hit me in the eye.
[25:05.600 --> 25:06.920]  And I was like, bro, there's a light leak right there.
[25:06.920 --> 25:08.840]  And he was like, well, should I need help with these plants?
[25:08.840 --> 25:10.400]  And so I helped him.
[25:10.400 --> 25:12.400]  And we harvested that together.
[25:12.400 --> 25:15.400]  And I used that experience that I'd had from my previous family members.
[25:15.400 --> 25:16.400]  They grew for quite a while.
[25:16.400 --> 25:17.400]  I watched them.
[25:17.400 --> 25:18.400]  Then I helped my buddy.
[25:18.400 --> 25:20.720]  Then I was helping some friends with the dispensary.
[25:20.720 --> 25:22.240]  I had been dabbling in growing.
[25:22.240 --> 25:25.640]  And I was talking about how I felt like I had some better ideas than the grower for
[25:25.640 --> 25:26.920]  that dispensary.
[25:26.920 --> 25:28.280]  So they made me the grower.
[25:28.280 --> 25:29.640]  They're like, okay, then guess what?
[25:29.640 --> 25:30.640]  You grow now.
[25:30.640 --> 25:31.640]  We fired him.
[25:31.640 --> 25:32.640]  You take over.
[25:32.640 --> 25:33.640]  And I was like, oh shit, pressure's on.
[25:33.640 --> 25:35.280]  They also gave me a bunch of equipment.
[25:35.280 --> 25:37.680]  So I set up some personal grows.
[25:37.720 --> 25:40.560]  And that compounded and expanded rapidly.
[25:40.560 --> 25:44.720]  I became known around my local town as the guy that could solve the problems in your
[25:44.720 --> 25:45.720]  grow.
[25:45.720 --> 25:47.040]  If there was something wrong, they would call me.
[25:47.040 --> 25:49.000]  They would come to the dispensary where I worked.
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.520]  They would say, after work, I need you to come look at my grow, or they would bring
[25:51.520 --> 25:52.520]  me pictures.
[25:52.520 --> 25:56.600]  And I would just politely help everybody solve the problems in their gardens.
[25:56.600 --> 26:01.040]  So I got a very good reputation as being a knowledgeable grower.
[26:01.040 --> 26:05.160]  Eventually that dispensary was closed because of some basically zoning reasons.
[26:05.160 --> 26:09.560]  There are dispensaries all around that bad bitch now, but that was the very first dispensary
[26:09.560 --> 26:10.560]  in my town.
[26:10.560 --> 26:11.600]  It was myself and some other friends.
[26:11.600 --> 26:13.440]  They shut us down for zoning.
[26:13.440 --> 26:15.340]  White Mike was a big part of that.
[26:15.340 --> 26:16.340]  That is gone.
[26:16.340 --> 26:17.440]  Let's not dwell on that place.
[26:17.440 --> 26:21.400]  But that gave me a lot of exposure and a lot of experience.
[26:21.400 --> 26:24.880]  So I started off as a young kid helping the family.
[26:24.880 --> 26:28.960]  I evolved into helping and kind of taking over a friend's grow in another state.
[26:28.960 --> 26:29.960]  He had an emergency.
[26:29.960 --> 26:30.960]  He left.
[26:30.960 --> 26:32.360]  I actually finished his crop for him.
[26:32.360 --> 26:35.120]  He came home, harvest day to cut it down.
[26:35.120 --> 26:36.160]  We dried it and cured it.
[26:36.160 --> 26:37.740]  He split it with me.
[26:37.740 --> 26:42.240]  That was one of my first crops that I felt like I kind of had a lot of control over.
[26:42.240 --> 26:44.340]  Then I got my own grows going.
[26:44.340 --> 26:46.480]  Then I was helping my friends with the dispensary.
[26:46.480 --> 26:47.960]  They kind of funded me with more gear.
[26:47.960 --> 26:49.360]  I got more grows going.
[26:49.360 --> 26:52.560]  So at that point, I've had a few grows under my belt.
[26:52.560 --> 26:56.540]  Now that I've got a dispensary grow to work with and multiple personal grows of my own
[26:56.540 --> 27:01.960]  to work with, I'm getting a lot of exposure to these plants, to their problems, to their
[27:01.960 --> 27:02.960]  cycles.
[27:02.960 --> 27:04.480]  I've got a lot of rooms to play with.
[27:04.840 --> 27:07.200]  Now I'm getting friends having me come over and look at crops.
[27:07.200 --> 27:11.720]  I made quite a reputation and had quite a nice little following around here when one
[27:11.720 --> 27:16.360]  of the larger dispensaries was rebuilding their facility and they called me and asked
[27:16.360 --> 27:18.400]  me to partner with them.
[27:18.400 --> 27:22.560]  I got to work with an architect and an HVAC person and a whole bunch of different people
[27:22.560 --> 27:25.000]  involved with the city and building codes.
[27:25.000 --> 27:30.280]  I learned a tremendous amount about building a cultivation facility and working with all
[27:30.280 --> 27:33.400]  of those contractors and licensing people.
[27:33.400 --> 27:36.760]  There was a lot to think about and a lot to work with in that process.
[27:36.760 --> 27:40.560]  I learned a tremendous amount there and got paid in that process.
[27:40.560 --> 27:42.560]  So that was a gift.
[27:42.560 --> 27:44.800]  Eventually I parted ways with that facility.
[27:44.800 --> 27:46.080]  There were just some personal issues.
[27:46.080 --> 27:47.680]  I didn't get along with the owner.
[27:47.680 --> 27:49.500]  We are different kinds of people.
[27:49.500 --> 27:50.840]  That is all I need to say about that.
[27:50.840 --> 27:53.820]  We are completely different types of people.
[27:53.820 --> 27:55.440]  I have no problem with who he is.
[27:55.440 --> 27:56.880]  He has no problem with who I am.
[27:56.880 --> 27:59.020]  We just see things differently.
[27:59.020 --> 28:00.080]  So we don't work together.
[28:00.080 --> 28:01.080]  So I moved on.
[28:01.080 --> 28:07.840]  I took over another grow in another location and in that grow I pulled 314 pounds out of
[28:07.840 --> 28:08.840]  100 lights.
[28:08.840 --> 28:12.320]  So I was pulling 3.14 pounds per light.
[28:12.320 --> 28:14.680]  I was really gaining momentum there.
[28:14.680 --> 28:17.680]  I got really good at commercial cultivation there.
[28:17.680 --> 28:22.480]  I trained another staff at that facility and then I moved on to another place where I had
[28:22.480 --> 28:23.640]  a nice staff.
[28:23.640 --> 28:25.520]  I had a really large facility.
[28:25.520 --> 28:28.380]  We built another facility next door.
[28:28.380 --> 28:32.820]  In the build of that next facility, I got to see and participate in a lot of the work
[28:32.820 --> 28:34.180]  and a lot of the meetings.
[28:34.180 --> 28:38.500]  I got to learn a lot again about HVAC installation, about sizing HVAC.
[28:38.500 --> 28:40.620]  I got to learn a lot about electricity.
[28:40.620 --> 28:45.940]  I got to learn about commercial cultivation, construction, the planning.
[28:45.940 --> 28:50.500]  I've seen all aspects of it from the idea in somebody's head to finding investors how
[28:50.500 --> 28:54.740]  to get the money to do it, to getting people to simply believe in you to get it done, to
[28:54.740 --> 28:58.980]  getting the lawyers, the accountants, the city people, the state people, the marijuana
[28:58.980 --> 29:03.020]  enforcement division, the department of ag, the people who need to put more electricity
[29:03.020 --> 29:04.020]  on that poll.
[29:04.020 --> 29:05.460]  You get to get all of them in the same room.
[29:05.460 --> 29:07.740]  I've been there for all of that silly shit.
[29:07.740 --> 29:08.740]  It is a struggle.
[29:08.740 --> 29:12.460]  It's a challenge, but I am so blessed that I've been involved in all of that because
[29:12.460 --> 29:16.860]  every one of those little things is a step that has gotten me to where I am now.
[29:16.860 --> 29:20.820]  So I saw that small facility expand to become a larger facility.
[29:20.820 --> 29:22.180]  I got to lead that team.
[29:22.180 --> 29:25.900]  I got to learn about commercial drying and curing, all of it.
[29:25.900 --> 29:27.580]  I've seen all aspects of it.
[29:27.580 --> 29:32.220]  Before I was even in the commercial growing part, I was a bud tender doing the over-the-counter
[29:32.220 --> 29:33.220]  part.
[29:33.220 --> 29:34.860]  So I got to see that aspect as well.
[29:34.860 --> 29:38.360]  Then I started doing consulting for many other commercial facilities.
[29:38.360 --> 29:42.120]  So I've walked into many facilities and seen how many places are built.
[29:42.120 --> 29:44.700]  I can walk in and tell you what's wrong with the facility.
[29:44.700 --> 29:50.940]  I can improve your cultivation by 30% within a certain amount of time, guaranteed.
[29:50.940 --> 29:51.940]  That's what I do.
[29:52.700 --> 29:54.500]  So it's been many steps to get to where I am today.
[29:54.500 --> 29:56.620]  It hasn't just been like a, hey, this happened.
[29:56.620 --> 29:58.140]  It took a lot of steps.
[29:58.140 --> 30:01.860]  So that is kind of how the commercial grow part of my career developed.
[30:01.860 --> 30:03.720]  The breeding was just passion.
[30:03.720 --> 30:06.180]  You said that you had a passion for the plants earlier.
[30:06.180 --> 30:10.420]  I simply have a fascination and a passion for breeding cannabis.
[30:10.420 --> 30:12.580]  I was growing these plants for a long time.
[30:12.580 --> 30:14.540]  I started buying seeds like most of us do.
[30:14.540 --> 30:15.860]  We trade clones with our friends.
[30:15.860 --> 30:17.700]  We get plants from here and there.
[30:17.700 --> 30:22.500]  Then you start seeing that they're all sevens out of 10 and you want an 11.
[30:22.500 --> 30:25.220]  As a passionate grower, I don't want to grow sevens.
[30:25.220 --> 30:26.220]  I don't want to grow eights.
[30:26.220 --> 30:28.740]  I want to grow fucking 11s all day.
[30:28.740 --> 30:32.500]  So I thought the only way I'm going to get anything better is if I order new seeds and
[30:32.500 --> 30:33.500]  get new shit in.
[30:33.500 --> 30:34.740]  So I got seeds.
[30:34.740 --> 30:36.580]  I was getting eights and nines.
[30:36.580 --> 30:37.940]  Didn't find any 10s or 11s.
[30:37.940 --> 30:40.220]  I was like, ah, there's something close here.
[30:40.220 --> 30:42.100]  I'm just not where I want to be.
[30:42.100 --> 30:45.300]  Then a couple of my friends were like, bro, it's not too far before you start breeding.
[30:45.300 --> 30:46.620]  I was like, it's not happening.
[30:46.620 --> 30:47.620]  I like growing.
[30:47.620 --> 30:49.340]  I'm focused on this.
[30:49.340 --> 30:50.500]  Then I was like, you know what?
[30:50.500 --> 30:52.300]  I like this plant and I like this plant a lot.
[30:52.300 --> 30:54.220]  It's really time to start doing some pollen chucking.
[30:54.220 --> 30:55.220]  I started breeding.
[30:55.220 --> 30:57.700]  My intention was to make seeds for myself.
[30:57.700 --> 30:59.420]  I made a bunch of seeds for myself.
[30:59.420 --> 31:00.820]  I started growing them.
[31:00.820 --> 31:02.860]  Some of my friends were like, bro, that is awesome.
[31:02.860 --> 31:03.860]  Can I have some?
[31:03.860 --> 31:05.020]  So I was giving seeds away.
[31:05.020 --> 31:09.700]  I went to a couple of cannabis cups in Denver and I gave away probably 5,000 seeds over
[31:09.700 --> 31:13.540]  two events, just passing out packs of five and 10 seeds to friends and random people
[31:13.540 --> 31:15.580]  and strangers and smokers.
[31:15.580 --> 31:19.380]  Anyone who I saw with nutrients, if they had a bag of nutrients, like they bought nutrients
[31:19.380 --> 31:23.140]  or were given a nutrient package at the show, I gave them seeds.
[31:23.140 --> 31:24.780]  Now you've got seeds to grow with those nutrients.
[31:24.780 --> 31:26.540]  It was a sign that they're a grower.
[31:26.540 --> 31:29.040]  I spread a bunch of seeds.
[31:29.040 --> 31:31.940]  You can't expect to just start a seed company.
[31:31.940 --> 31:34.900]  It takes a lot of time to develop a brand.
[31:34.900 --> 31:36.660]  You have to develop seeds.
[31:36.660 --> 31:37.780]  Those seeds have to grow.
[31:37.780 --> 31:40.100]  People have to see that it is something worth growing.
[31:40.100 --> 31:42.180]  You have to create demand.
[31:42.180 --> 31:44.660]  Mostly it has to just be a quality product.
[31:44.740 --> 31:46.100]  That comes from me being passionate.
[31:46.100 --> 31:48.380]  I keep going back to that passion.
[31:48.380 --> 31:54.900]  The cultivation part, the knowledge, the experience, that commercial aspect of my career, that
[31:54.900 --> 32:00.980]  all came from experience, from slow baby steps and exposure and also doing a good fucking
[32:00.980 --> 32:01.980]  job.
[32:01.980 --> 32:06.340]  I talk about the way to get into the industry is to go be a trimmer or just show up.
[32:06.340 --> 32:07.620]  Showing up is the first step.
[32:07.620 --> 32:08.620]  Show up.
[32:08.620 --> 32:11.020]  So I started off and showed that I could do it.
[32:11.020 --> 32:12.620]  I was like, man, I can help you transplant.
[32:12.620 --> 32:14.540]  I transplanted like a champion.
[32:14.540 --> 32:16.100]  Then one day they needed help bud tending.
[32:16.100 --> 32:17.100]  I bud tended.
[32:17.100 --> 32:18.100]  They're like, dude, you're good at that.
[32:18.100 --> 32:20.380]  Then eventually I ended up with the keys to the whole facility.
[32:20.380 --> 32:21.980]  It was basically mine.
[32:21.980 --> 32:25.660]  So baby steps get you going, showing that you give a shit.
[32:25.660 --> 32:26.860]  That'll get you there.
[32:26.860 --> 32:29.620]  It's like going to martial arts or playing an instrument or something.
[32:29.620 --> 32:31.260]  You got to start off learning your rudiments.
[32:31.260 --> 32:33.060]  Then one day you're doing paradiddles with your feet.
[32:33.060 --> 32:34.980]  If you're doing karate, you start off.
[32:34.980 --> 32:38.340]  They start you off in karate just throwing left punch, right punch, left punch, right
[32:38.340 --> 32:39.340]  punch.
[32:39.340 --> 32:41.380]  10 years later, you're fucking doing back flips and spin kicks.
[32:41.420 --> 32:42.900]  It all starts off in baby steps.
[32:42.900 --> 32:46.140]  So that's how the career aspect of my life got going.
[32:46.140 --> 32:49.180]  Then the breeding, the seed part, that is all passion.
[32:49.180 --> 32:52.140]  That is just my love for growing, for breeding.
[32:52.140 --> 32:56.140]  When you breed some seeds and then you've got a handful of seeds, the real excitement
[32:56.140 --> 32:57.180]  is in growing those.
[32:57.180 --> 32:58.660]  You get to see what you just created.
[32:58.660 --> 33:00.660]  Did I just make the next chem dog?
[33:00.660 --> 33:02.260]  Did I just make a bunch of duds?
[33:02.260 --> 33:03.900]  Did I make something that tastes magical?
[33:03.900 --> 33:07.460]  Did I make really amazing medicine for my friends that are sick?
[33:07.460 --> 33:10.780]  Did I make something that is totally a piece of shit and I got to throw it away?
[33:11.180 --> 33:13.060]  That is so much fun to find out.
[33:13.060 --> 33:17.260]  It's a very similar feeling to opening Christmas presents or even better, it's like opening
[33:17.260 --> 33:22.400]  up a package of baseball cards or I guess it's 2020 so they're fucking Pokemon cards
[33:22.400 --> 33:25.980]  or Magic the Gathering cards now and you're looking to see what you got.
[33:25.980 --> 33:28.340]  But in cannabis plants, you've got to wait a little while.
[33:28.340 --> 33:31.700]  So you got to make the seeds and then you got to grow them out and you get to watch.
[33:31.700 --> 33:33.660]  And while they're vegging, you're paying attention.
[33:33.660 --> 33:34.660]  That one's a little taller.
[33:34.660 --> 33:35.660]  That one's kind of stretchier.
[33:35.660 --> 33:37.480]  That one's got some crazy leaves.
[33:37.480 --> 33:39.620]  And then when you start flowering them, it gets exciting.
[33:39.620 --> 33:40.620]  You pull out all the boys.
[33:41.460 --> 33:43.420]  You're like, damn it, I was hoping that one was a girl because it was pretty.
[33:43.420 --> 33:46.380]  And then about week five, you're like, oh, look at the buds on this one.
[33:46.380 --> 33:48.460]  And week six, it started stinking.
[33:48.460 --> 33:50.660]  Week seven and eight, you're like, holy shit, look what I did.
[33:50.660 --> 33:52.020]  I made amazing buds.
[33:52.020 --> 33:53.020]  Or you're like, ah, look what I did.
[33:53.020 --> 33:54.460]  There's a bunch of duds.
[33:54.460 --> 33:55.460]  But it's so much fun.
[33:55.460 --> 33:58.900]  And that's all that passion that you can hear in my voice when it comes to talking about
[33:58.900 --> 34:01.540]  a pheno hunt of seeds that I've bred.
[34:01.540 --> 34:03.340]  That is what got me here.
[34:03.340 --> 34:09.140]  Always staying passionate, always loving that plant and always breeding for what I felt
[34:09.140 --> 34:13.140]  was right and not just doing it for something that I thought would be some kind of hype.
[34:13.140 --> 34:18.380]  Yes, I was asked one time to make a strain by another professional breeder, and his idea
[34:18.380 --> 34:19.660]  was fucking a hit.
[34:19.660 --> 34:20.820]  It went very well for me.
[34:20.820 --> 34:25.540]  So I'm glad that he kind of recommended or asked me to do that favor because in my career,
[34:25.540 --> 34:27.100]  that did help me quite well.
[34:27.100 --> 34:31.380]  So just doing things that I thought were right, just following my heart, following my head,
[34:31.380 --> 34:35.860]  try not to screw anybody over, try not to do anything from my ego or from my wallet
[34:35.900 --> 34:39.580]  or anything like that or for hype or for fame, just doing it because I love it.
[34:39.580 --> 34:44.020]  That seems to be what kept me moving forward and kept me in this game for so long.
[34:44.020 --> 34:47.660]  And honestly, right now, I feel like I'm at a high point and I'm just going up.
[34:47.660 --> 34:52.180]  I've never felt like my company, like iReed Genetics, has had so much momentum before
[34:52.180 --> 34:54.340]  it has until this exact moment.
[34:54.340 --> 34:57.500]  And I feel like it just gets stronger and stronger every day.
[34:57.500 --> 35:01.700]  And then where that commercial side and that breeding side meet is I get the ability to
[35:01.700 --> 35:06.820]  run large batches of plants, large populations in other people's facilities and see what
[35:06.820 --> 35:07.820]  they do.
[35:07.820 --> 35:09.980]  That also gives me access to many plants.
[35:09.980 --> 35:14.060]  So that's where the commercial and the breeder and the passion side kind of combine.
[35:14.060 --> 35:17.900]  And I also believe in that phrase that people say, if you love your job, you don't work
[35:17.900 --> 35:19.900]  a day in your life or something like that.
[35:19.900 --> 35:23.020]  I love what I'm doing and it shows.
[35:23.020 --> 35:27.580]  Business owners, grow owners, dispensary owners, they can tell when I show up that I'm excited
[35:27.700 --> 35:30.580]  and eager to get their grow going top notch.
[35:30.580 --> 35:34.420]  And they see it in just a few days, just a couple of weeks, I start turning the grow
[35:34.420 --> 35:35.420]  around.
[35:35.420 --> 35:38.720]  So that passion, that experience has gotten me a long way.
[35:38.720 --> 35:40.860]  So let me recap because you did ask a question.
[35:40.860 --> 35:42.380]  I just got off on a long rant.
[35:42.380 --> 35:44.740]  I am not sure what to recommend for schooling.
[35:44.740 --> 35:46.980]  I would say stay in business school.
[35:46.980 --> 35:49.740]  That's going to get you the furthest, in my opinion.
[35:49.740 --> 35:52.380]  Then you ask, what steps did I take?
[35:52.380 --> 35:55.220]  I didn't know it at the time, but the steps were presented to me.
[35:55.220 --> 35:56.420]  I don't know what you believe in.
[35:56.420 --> 36:00.180]  I don't talk about that sort of stuff on the show.
[36:00.180 --> 36:01.900]  I follow Rastafari.
[36:01.900 --> 36:06.620]  I think that Jah put those steps in front of me and I was wise enough to take the opportunities
[36:06.620 --> 36:08.020]  that were presented.
[36:08.020 --> 36:11.660]  And by doing what I thought was right, I ended up right where I feel like I'm supposed to
[36:11.660 --> 36:12.660]  be.
[36:12.660 --> 36:14.660]  All right, let me get back on track because I got really rambly here.
[36:14.660 --> 36:17.060]  He wraps this up with, I would love to hear back from you.
[36:17.060 --> 36:18.580]  Keep up the bomb ass podcast.
[36:18.580 --> 36:22.540]  Hey, I hope you just listened to that long winded rant and I'm glad that you think the
[36:22.540 --> 36:24.100]  podcast is bomb ass.
[36:24.100 --> 36:26.180]  I want to thank you for the great email.
