[00:14.680 --> 00:18.280]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist
[00:18.280 --> 00:21.240]  or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:21.560 --> 00:23.800]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:24.320 --> 00:26.320]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.

[00:47.480 --> 00:49.120]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:53.600 --> 00:54.960]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:54.960 --> 00:58.280]  It's time for episode 305 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:58.520 --> 01:00.560]  This is going to be another Thursday Quickie episode.
[01:00.560 --> 01:02.240]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:02.240 --> 01:04.360]  I like to start these episodes off by letting you know
[01:04.560 --> 01:06.200]  what I've been smoking on all day.
[01:06.200 --> 01:09.320]  Instead, I'm going to tell you what I wish I was smoking on.
[01:09.760 --> 01:14.040]  On Sunday, I stopped at a dispensary in Colorado Springs called A Cut Above.
[01:14.040 --> 01:15.760]  It was a medical dispensary.
[01:15.760 --> 01:19.920]  They had about 75-ish concentrates on the shelf to offer.
[01:19.920 --> 01:22.480]  They also had some of the best flowers I've seen in a long time.
[01:22.800 --> 01:25.640]  But what I was there for was concentrates.
[01:25.640 --> 01:26.400]  I'm not joking.
[01:26.400 --> 01:29.840]  There were probably 75 quality concentrates to look through
[01:29.840 --> 01:31.920]  before I made my decision.
[01:31.920 --> 01:34.800]  I was about halfway through, and I stumbled across something called
[01:34.800 --> 01:36.360]  Star Child OG.
[01:36.360 --> 01:39.320]  I've done an episode called Follow Your Nose, talking about whatever
[01:39.320 --> 01:42.200]  jumps out at your nose is probably going to probably going to be good medicine
[01:42.200 --> 01:43.200]  for you.
[01:43.200 --> 01:46.840]  I smelled this Star Child OG and something in my brain, my nose and my body said,
[01:47.200 --> 01:48.600]  Rasta Jeff, just buy this.
[01:48.600 --> 01:50.560]  There's no need to look any further.
[01:50.560 --> 01:51.600]  I set a gram of that aside.
[01:51.600 --> 01:52.440]  Of course, I'm stubborn.
[01:52.440 --> 01:56.200]  I looked further and I found some of this super sour lemon live resin from Oleo.
[01:56.320 --> 01:57.440]  It smells and tastes amazing.
[01:57.440 --> 02:01.000]  But this Star Child, it had this Durban poison,
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.240]  Jack Herr, super lemon haze, kind of a flavor going on to it and an aroma.
[02:05.760 --> 02:07.520]  And it was saucy.
[02:07.520 --> 02:11.000]  It was high cannabinoid, full spectrum extract crystals floating around
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.080]  in high cannabinoid, full or high terpene, full spectrum extract terps.
[02:15.360 --> 02:18.880]  So it was crystals and sauce just floating around in a tiny jar together.
[02:18.880 --> 02:21.240]  And the aroma just kept punching me in the face.
[02:21.920 --> 02:24.480]  Unfortunately, it disappeared very quickly.
[02:24.480 --> 02:26.840]  I smoked that gram Sunday with Kev.
[02:26.920 --> 02:28.960]  Kevin and I destroyed that gram.
[02:28.960 --> 02:31.360]  We enjoyed it, but it disappeared very quickly.
[02:31.600 --> 02:34.080]  So I've been thinking about it, wishing I had more.
[02:34.080 --> 02:34.880]  I came home today.
[02:34.880 --> 02:37.320]  I was going to take some dabs after work and I picked up my dab rig
[02:37.320 --> 02:38.600]  and it was a little mucky.
[02:38.600 --> 02:40.200]  I was like, maybe I should rinse that thing out.
[02:40.200 --> 02:42.400]  So I took it to the sink and ran some hot water through it.
[02:42.920 --> 02:46.080]  As soon as that hot water hit my rig,
[02:46.560 --> 02:50.680]  I could smell that dryer sheet terpene, Jack Herr, Durban
[02:50.680 --> 02:53.360]  poison smell throughout the entire kitchen area.
[02:53.400 --> 02:55.800]  It was overwhelmingly perfectly amazing.
[02:56.080 --> 02:58.960]  It was like some sort of aromatherapy candle had been lit,
[02:58.960 --> 03:00.480]  like somebody had some potpourri
[03:00.480 --> 03:02.960]  or somebody sprayed one of those little things in the room.
[03:03.440 --> 03:05.400]  It smelled so good.
[03:05.400 --> 03:06.960]  It made my mouth drool.
[03:06.960 --> 03:08.840]  It made me wish I had more of those dabs.
[03:08.840 --> 03:12.040]  So the Starchild OG, that's what I wish I was dabbing on right now.
[03:12.040 --> 03:13.400]  That stuff was amazing.
[03:13.400 --> 03:15.720]  Somebody told me it was actually snow lotus from Bodhi.
[03:15.720 --> 03:17.160]  I'm not sure if that's accurate.
[03:17.160 --> 03:19.120]  Whatever it was, shout out to a cut above.
[03:19.280 --> 03:20.880]  That was some delicious extract.
[03:20.880 --> 03:22.040]  The high was amazing.
[03:22.040 --> 03:24.320]  The color, the consistency, the flavor, the aroma.
[03:24.600 --> 03:25.480]  Beautiful concentrates.
[03:25.480 --> 03:29.440]  Unfortunately, I bought the very last gram that they had when I was there.
[03:29.760 --> 03:33.720]  So unless they've got more next time, that was my last shot at that.
[03:33.760 --> 03:35.520]  So the Starchild OG was delicious.
[03:35.520 --> 03:36.480]  Wish I had more.
[03:36.480 --> 03:39.320]  The kitchen smells like it right now, even though I don't have any.
[03:39.320 --> 03:42.560]  I do have a nice clean rig and I've been dabbing since I cleaned the rig.
[03:42.840 --> 03:48.400]  I've been taking dabs of the pre 98 Bubba Kush Ambrosia batter from Apothecary.
[03:48.920 --> 03:51.240]  It has got sort of a and I know I say this a lot.
[03:51.440 --> 03:55.240]  Earthy coffee, cushy sort of a smell to it, plus a hint of chocolate.
[03:55.800 --> 03:58.200]  So it's earthy, cushy.
[03:58.520 --> 04:02.720]  Coffee, chocolate, maybe with a little like a sweet thing in there also.
[04:04.080 --> 04:06.000]  The pre 98 Bubba Kush, I'm smelling it again.
[04:08.360 --> 04:09.160]  Oh, it's delicious.
[04:09.160 --> 04:10.720]  I think I described it accurately.
[04:10.720 --> 04:13.760]  Earth, coffee, chocolate and kush.
[04:14.600 --> 04:16.600]  So I'm dabbing the pre 98 Bubba Kush batter.
[04:16.840 --> 04:19.960]  I'm getting decent sized dabs of the batter and putting it on the dabber.
[04:20.400 --> 04:24.040]  Then I'm getting some bobblehead high cannabinoid full spectrum extract
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.240]  crystals and dunking that batter into the crystals to pick it up like salt
[04:28.240 --> 04:29.200]  and pepper on my dab.
[04:29.480 --> 04:34.640]  So I got a little bobblehead crystals on the dab and the bobblehead is pre 98
[04:34.640 --> 04:37.200]  Bubba Kush and headband ran together.
[04:37.360 --> 04:40.800]  So those are pretty nice dabs, lots of flavor from the batter.
[04:41.360 --> 04:46.160]  The bobblehead concentrate is 98% total cannabinoids.
[04:46.280 --> 04:48.080]  So I'm getting a lot of THC in my brain.
[04:48.080 --> 04:50.920]  When I take a dab of that, I'm getting a lot of cannabinoids, a lot of flavor.
[04:51.280 --> 04:55.600]  Uh, and the batter gives me this nice lung punch that I really enjoy.
[04:55.600 --> 04:57.120]  So super great dabs today.
[04:57.120 --> 04:58.160]  I'm glad I cleaned the rig.
[04:58.560 --> 04:59.680]  That's what I'm smoking on.
[05:00.040 --> 05:00.800]  Thanks for joining me.
[05:00.840 --> 05:03.680]  Let's move forward with a podcast.
[05:04.160 --> 05:09.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, Saturday night, I got to go see Chris Hardwick at
[05:09.960 --> 05:14.480]  Comedy Works in downtown Denver and holy shit, what a fun show.
[05:14.680 --> 05:15.680]  I had a great time.
[05:16.600 --> 05:17.960]  Uh, let's start from the beginning.
[05:18.520 --> 05:22.000]  Uh, April Richardson, the host and producer, well, not the host, the producer
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.080]  of the Nerdist now known as the identity podcast, I don't remember how to say it.
[05:27.080 --> 05:27.720]  Identity.
[05:28.080 --> 05:31.640]  Uh, Nerdist changed the name of all their stuff, but anyway, Chris Hardwick
[05:31.640 --> 05:32.960]  changed the name of his podcast.
[05:33.480 --> 05:34.160]  Uh, listen to it.
[05:34.160 --> 05:34.760]  He'll tell you why.
[05:35.320 --> 05:37.560]  Anyway, April Richardson opened.
[05:37.600 --> 05:38.520]  She was pretty funny.
[05:38.640 --> 05:40.800]  Uh, she makes fun of herself a lot.
[05:40.840 --> 05:42.360]  She's a very unique looking woman.
[05:42.520 --> 05:44.240]  So she uses that to her advantage.
[05:44.560 --> 05:46.480]  Uh, Miss Jenny Beth was my date for the show.
[05:46.600 --> 05:49.920]  Uh, the, uh, the comedian, April Richardson was from Georgia.
[05:49.920 --> 05:51.080]  Jenny Beth is from Georgia.
[05:51.120 --> 05:52.760]  They had a connection that was fun.
[05:52.760 --> 05:53.880]  Of course we were sitting up front.
[05:53.880 --> 05:56.840]  So when the comedian comedian, I think that's what you call lady comedian.
[05:57.080 --> 06:00.360]  When she said she was from Georgia, Jenny screamed like, woohoo, because
[06:00.360 --> 06:02.040]  they're both from Georgia and now they made friends.
[06:02.040 --> 06:05.040]  It was pretty cool to have her kind of come perform right in front
[06:05.040 --> 06:06.000]  of Jenny for a few minutes.
[06:06.120 --> 06:07.000]  So that was a good time.
[06:07.360 --> 06:12.880]  Then, uh, Miss April Richardson brought out a guy by the name of Mike Furman.
[06:12.880 --> 06:16.000]  And I knew Mike Furman would be there because I saw a guitar on stage.
[06:16.040 --> 06:19.080]  When we walked in, that was a huge hint that Mike Furman would be there.
[06:19.480 --> 06:22.960]  Mike Furman is one of Chris Hardwick's best friends from a long time ago.
[06:22.960 --> 06:23.880]  They go way back.
[06:24.120 --> 06:26.680]  They used to be in a group called hard and firm together.
[06:26.680 --> 06:26.960]  That's right.
[06:26.960 --> 06:28.240]  Chris Hardwick, Mike Furman.
[06:28.240 --> 06:33.680]  They made a group called hard and firm where they would sing really good shitty
[06:33.680 --> 06:34.200]  songs.
[06:35.040 --> 06:35.440]  Yes.
[06:35.480 --> 06:37.280]  I said really good shitty songs.
[06:37.520 --> 06:40.640]  Musical comedy is always terrible unless you're in the mood for it.
[06:40.640 --> 06:46.400]  Unless it's hard and firm or maybe Wheeler Walker, but usually it's not good.
[06:46.400 --> 06:46.600]  Right.
[06:46.600 --> 06:47.520]  But these guys pull it off.
[06:47.520 --> 06:49.120]  They're cheesy white guys and they nail it.
[06:49.400 --> 06:54.680]  So, uh, Furman comes out and does quite a bit of good material.
[06:54.880 --> 06:55.400]  Quite a bit.
[06:55.400 --> 06:57.240]  I don't want to ruin any of it because it was all great.
[06:57.520 --> 06:58.160]  Go see it.
[06:58.160 --> 07:00.440]  If they're coming toward your area, go there.
[07:00.480 --> 07:02.800]  You guys, I drove two hours to go see this show.
[07:02.800 --> 07:04.160]  You have no excuse to not go, go see it.
[07:04.160 --> 07:05.040]  It's fucking hilarious.
[07:05.360 --> 07:07.160]  So Mike Furman does a, a nice set.
[07:07.160 --> 07:10.280]  Then he, of course brings out the legend, Chris Hardwick.
[07:10.520 --> 07:15.000]  Chris Hardwick comes out and did, I don't know, he must've done a solid hour, hour
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.200]  and 10 minutes and he killed the entire hour and 10 minutes.
[07:18.440 --> 07:23.280]  He, uh, so he asked the people on stage on that side, he was just having, he does
[07:23.280 --> 07:24.200]  a lot of crowd work.
[07:24.200 --> 07:25.560]  He interacts with the audience quite a bit.
[07:25.560 --> 07:27.600]  So he asked the people over there, he's like, Hey, what do you do for work?
[07:27.600 --> 07:29.080]  And the one guy's like, I'm a geologist.
[07:29.080 --> 07:29.680]  And he's like, cool.
[07:29.680 --> 07:31.920]  And he made rock jokes and he asked the next person, what do you do for work?
[07:31.920 --> 07:35.400]  And the person sitting next to that person said, we're all three geologists.
[07:35.400 --> 07:37.880]  Chris Hardwick is like, damn it, Denver, you're allowed to hang out with other
[07:37.880 --> 07:38.200]  people.
[07:38.440 --> 07:41.480]  And then he walks to the other side of the stage and he's going to interview
[07:41.480 --> 07:41.960]  people over there.
[07:41.960 --> 07:43.200]  And he's like, sir, what do you do for work?
[07:43.200 --> 07:44.760]  And the guy's like, I'm a project manager.
[07:45.080 --> 07:45.960]  And he's like, sounds good.
[07:45.960 --> 07:47.440]  Are you sure you're not a geologist?
[07:47.440 --> 07:47.960]  Ha ha ha.
[07:48.480 --> 07:51.320]  And then he asks that man's date, what do you do for work?
[07:51.440 --> 07:54.920]  And she laughs really hard and turns red and says, I'm a project manager.
[07:55.280 --> 07:58.600]  So on one side of the stage, we've got geologists on the other side of the stage,
[07:58.640 --> 08:02.080]  project managers, and Hardwick is saying to himself, no, I'm not a geologist.
[08:02.080 --> 08:03.040]  I'm a project manager.
[08:03.160 --> 08:05.880]  Project managers and Hardwick is saying to himself, damn it.
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.960]  Or not to himself out loud, damn it, Denver date, other people.
[08:08.960 --> 08:10.400]  You don't have to stay in your box.
[08:10.960 --> 08:14.560]  Then he looks at me and he smiles and he says, you, and he sticks the mic in my
[08:14.560 --> 08:14.840]  face.
[08:14.840 --> 08:16.760]  And he says, what do you do for work, sir?
[08:17.480 --> 08:20.600]  And I proudly said, I am in the cannabis industry.
[08:21.000 --> 08:22.120]  And I said it just like that.
[08:22.120 --> 08:24.040]  You guys, I didn't embarrass the cannabis industry.
[08:24.040 --> 08:25.040]  I didn't embarrass myself.
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.600]  I didn't say I grow weed, bro.
[08:26.880 --> 08:29.320]  Cause everybody knows that when they look at me, I got dreadlocks, red eyes, a
[08:29.320 --> 08:31.320]  crooked grassroots hats and a veg bloom t-shirt.
[08:31.640 --> 08:32.560]  Uh, I grow weed.
[08:33.040 --> 08:34.440]  I tried to say it professionally.
[08:34.680 --> 08:36.720]  And I said, I am in the cannabis industry.
[08:37.280 --> 08:38.360]  And he goes, yeah, no shit.
[08:38.360 --> 08:39.120]  I could probably tell.
[08:39.120 --> 08:39.400]  Right.
[08:39.720 --> 08:42.400]  And he made a couple of jokes and he walked around the stage and goes on about
[08:42.400 --> 08:43.000]  it for a few minutes.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.120]  Then he makes a joke about how the geologists, the, uh, the project managers
[08:48.120 --> 08:49.880]  and myself should get together and start a business, right?
[08:49.880 --> 08:52.320]  Because we've got the guy that breaks up the rocks and the guy that grows the
[08:52.320 --> 08:55.200]  dope and the guy that does the project managing and the Hardwick made some
[08:55.200 --> 08:55.720]  jokes on that.
[08:55.720 --> 08:59.000]  Then he came back to miss Jenny Beth, cause she was sitting next to me and said,
[08:59.000 --> 09:00.680]  ma'am, what do you do for work?
[09:00.680 --> 09:02.360]  And of course, Jenny Beth told the truth.
[09:02.400 --> 09:07.320]  She said, I am in the cannabis industry and the crowd and Hardwick went fucking
[09:07.320 --> 09:07.720]  wild.
[09:07.720 --> 09:09.040]  I thought it was pretty damn funny.
[09:09.240 --> 09:10.160]  It was hilarious.
[09:10.640 --> 09:12.080]  Uh, he made fun of us for a couple of minutes.
[09:12.080 --> 09:12.880]  Then he walked away.
[09:13.200 --> 09:14.240]  Then we were on a date.
[09:14.480 --> 09:15.480]  I took the girl on a date.
[09:15.480 --> 09:18.280]  So I looked at her and I gave her a little kiss after Hardwick made fun of us.
[09:18.280 --> 09:21.480]  Cause honestly, Jenny Beth has a huge crush, crush on Hardwick.
[09:21.480 --> 09:24.800]  And I don't know if I'm supposed to say that on the podcast, but Hey, I'm not
[09:24.800 --> 09:25.280]  hiding shit.
[09:25.320 --> 09:28.160]  Uh, Jenny's got a hat has had a crush on Hardwick since she was a kid, she said.
[09:28.160 --> 09:31.600]  So, uh, I gave her a kiss because I took her to that show and I was like, look
[09:31.640 --> 09:32.320]  what I got to do, babe.
[09:32.440 --> 09:33.840]  Hardwick inter interacted with you.
[09:33.840 --> 09:34.360]  Fun date.
[09:34.400 --> 09:34.920]  We win.
[09:35.160 --> 09:36.120]  So I gave her a kiss, right?
[09:36.160 --> 09:37.680]  And Hardwick goes, Oh, they kissed.
[09:37.680 --> 09:38.400]  How sweet.
[09:38.600 --> 09:40.560]  And I went, Oh, how sweet Hardwick.
[09:40.600 --> 09:41.400]  Cause he was right in front of me.
[09:41.400 --> 09:42.440]  I'm front row at comedy works.
[09:42.840 --> 09:46.480]  Uh, and then he goes, Oh my God, there was probably some marijuana lipstick or
[09:46.480 --> 09:47.200]  something involved.
[09:47.200 --> 09:47.760]  Wasn't there?
[09:48.200 --> 09:49.640]  And I said, absolutely dude.
[09:49.680 --> 09:52.720]  And then he got real like serious and he came and stood right in front of me.
[09:52.720 --> 09:57.480]  He goes, Hey, somebody told me there's marijuana suppositories.
[09:57.480 --> 10:00.920]  And he did the little finger motion, like, like, you know, like suppositories.
[10:01.240 --> 10:02.760]  And me and Jenny Beth were like, yeah.
[10:02.840 --> 10:03.520]  And he just laughed.
[10:03.520 --> 10:06.080]  He's like, Oh my God, they know about it and they're proud of it.
[10:06.600 --> 10:07.920]  And they're like, have you tried these?
[10:07.920 --> 10:09.920]  And me and Jenny, of course, cause we're like, yeah.
[10:10.320 --> 10:11.760]  And he's like, Oh my God.
[10:11.760 --> 10:13.440]  And then Jenny did the finger motion back to him.
[10:13.440 --> 10:17.600]  The like, like if you're going to just insert one in someone's bum, boink, she
[10:17.600 --> 10:20.400]  did that motion and Hardwick just laughed and put his hand on his face and did the,
[10:20.720 --> 10:22.680]  uh, shaking my dad damn head laughing.
[10:22.680 --> 10:23.680]  He did that emoji.
[10:24.080 --> 10:26.160]  Uh, it was just fucking, it was funny.
[10:26.160 --> 10:29.160]  So we got to see Chris Hardwick, you guys, and I am fucking humble bragging because
[10:29.200 --> 10:31.040]  it was a great fucking time.
[10:31.280 --> 10:33.000]  Uh, so Hardwick did his set.
[10:33.840 --> 10:35.400]  Uh, he interacted with the audience quite a bit.
[10:35.400 --> 10:36.400]  He goes into the audience.
[10:36.400 --> 10:37.720]  He sits on the audience's lap.
[10:38.160 --> 10:41.520]  He interacted with a kid named Ian a lot, embarrassed the shit out of this kid.
[10:41.520 --> 10:42.280]  The kid was purple.
[10:42.480 --> 10:43.840]  He may have pissed himself a little bit.
[10:44.080 --> 10:44.800]  It was a good time.
[10:44.840 --> 10:47.480]  If you get the opportunity to go see Chris Hardwick, go do it.
[10:47.720 --> 10:48.920]  So Hardwick does his set.
[10:48.920 --> 10:52.320]  Then he's like, would you guys mind if I bring out Mike Furman again?
[10:52.320 --> 10:53.280]  Cause that's his best friend.
[10:53.560 --> 10:58.200]  And Furman came out and they did another 20 or 30 minutes together of crowd
[10:58.200 --> 11:00.000]  work and like improv comedy.
[11:00.520 --> 11:02.480]  And then at the end, I'm not going to ruin it.
[11:02.640 --> 11:06.120]  I'm not going to tell you what it was about or what they said or anything, but
[11:06.680 --> 11:08.280]  they sang a song together.
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.880]  It was very, very unique.
[11:10.960 --> 11:15.480]  There was a video in the background that matched their theatrics were beautiful.
[11:16.720 --> 11:19.600]  Uh, I thought I was going to break something laughing so hard
[11:19.640 --> 11:21.360]  and it was fucking hilarious.
[11:21.360 --> 11:24.560]  So you guys go see Chris Hardwick, go to comedy works.
[11:24.560 --> 11:28.600]  If you go to comedy works, uh, tell him Rasta Jeff sent you and have a good ass
[11:28.600 --> 11:30.720]  time and be a good, be a good comedy guest.
[11:30.720 --> 11:31.280]  Don't heckle.
[11:31.440 --> 11:32.360]  Go enjoy the show.
[11:32.560 --> 11:32.800]  All right.
[11:32.840 --> 11:33.640]  I saw Chris Hardwick.
[11:33.640 --> 11:34.080]  It was fun.
[11:34.080 --> 11:35.640]  You guys, I had to brag on the podcast.
[11:36.520 --> 11:37.720]  Come see a comedy show with me.
[11:38.160 --> 11:38.480]  All right.
[11:39.320 --> 11:41.160]  Um, really quickly.
[11:42.240 --> 11:47.320]  Let's talk about something that somebody asked me on Instagram live.
[11:47.320 --> 11:51.560]  I do Instagram live videos where I will answer cannabis grow questions.
[11:51.560 --> 11:52.960]  I'll answer all kinds of weird questions.
[11:52.960 --> 11:55.840]  We talk about all kinds of random shit on my Instagram live videos.
[11:56.040 --> 11:56.840]  So join me on there.
[11:56.840 --> 11:58.960]  I'm irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[11:59.000 --> 11:59.880]  I read genetics.
[12:01.360 --> 12:03.240]  So somebody asked me, it was actually bagsy.
[12:03.240 --> 12:07.640]  Jesse asked me to explain the difference between F two and BX.
[12:07.920 --> 12:12.720]  Now I thought of a really easy way to explain this F two.
[12:13.080 --> 12:16.400]  So let's say you take, let's just pick a strain.
[12:16.400 --> 12:17.480]  We're going to say a rise.
[12:17.680 --> 12:18.640]  So you've got a rise.
[12:18.960 --> 12:20.760]  You've got a handful of arise seeds.
[12:21.400 --> 12:24.000]  You make an arise male and you make an arise female.
[12:25.280 --> 12:26.360]  Now let's back up a step.
[12:26.520 --> 12:28.080]  I'm going to correct myself and back up a step.
[12:28.760 --> 12:31.760]  Let's say you're certain that these seeds are F ones that
[12:31.760 --> 12:33.080]  your arise seeds are F one.
[12:33.080 --> 12:34.640]  This is the only way that this works.
[12:35.640 --> 12:38.840]  Well, for my example, these arise seeds are F ones.
[12:39.000 --> 12:39.840]  I made the seeds.
[12:39.840 --> 12:40.720]  I gave them to you.
[12:40.720 --> 12:42.480]  You've got seeds that you know are F ones.
[12:42.480 --> 12:42.680]  Okay.
[12:42.680 --> 12:44.000]  So you've got an arise F one.
[12:44.320 --> 12:46.400]  You find a male and a female that is F one.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.320]  When I crossed daybreaker to golden goat, daybreaker and golden goat,
[12:50.320 --> 12:52.480]  I crossed them, they made new seeds.
[12:52.480 --> 12:53.160]  That's an F one.
[12:53.200 --> 12:53.360]  Okay.
[12:53.360 --> 12:53.960]  That's arise.
[12:53.960 --> 12:54.680]  That's the F one.
[12:54.840 --> 12:56.000]  You got some of those from me.
[12:56.480 --> 12:57.840]  Then you found a male and a female.
[12:58.680 --> 13:00.720]  That's a male F one and a female F one.
[13:00.880 --> 13:01.160]  Okay.
[13:01.880 --> 13:05.360]  If you cross those, you make F two.
[13:06.520 --> 13:06.760]  Okay.
[13:06.760 --> 13:10.240]  If you cross from the same handful of seeds, if you cross the male and
[13:10.240 --> 13:17.280]  female from the same batch batch, filial generation, you are now making F twos.
[13:17.320 --> 13:18.720]  Filial generation F two.
[13:18.960 --> 13:22.880]  And if you take a handful of F twos and you cross those together, a male and a
[13:22.880 --> 13:25.960]  female, you're making F three and so forth, but they have to come from.
[13:26.880 --> 13:29.520]  So the male, female F one pollinate each other.
[13:29.880 --> 13:31.120]  They make this handful of seeds.
[13:31.120 --> 13:34.000]  You take these handful of seeds, you find males and females, you breed
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.600]  them together, you make F threes.
[13:35.840 --> 13:38.560]  Those seeds that come up, you breed them together, you make F fours.
[13:38.800 --> 13:39.080]  Now.
[13:39.640 --> 13:48.080]  So a BX would be if I took the arise F one seeds that I have and bred them back
[13:48.080 --> 13:52.520]  to either the golden goat or the daybreaker, that would be a BX.
[13:52.880 --> 13:57.680]  So in the most disgusting terms to say it, F twos are brother and sister
[13:57.680 --> 14:01.800]  fucking, F threes are brother and sister fucking, continuing, continuing
[14:01.800 --> 14:06.680]  filial generations are brother and sister fucking, BXing is parent fucking.
[14:06.840 --> 14:07.200]  Okay.
[14:07.360 --> 14:10.320]  That's fucking disgusting to think about it that way, but now the idea is clear
[14:10.320 --> 14:15.360]  in your head and there's no confusion on what the difference between an F or a BX is.
[14:15.520 --> 14:22.080]  So if you want to make filial generations forward, you just keep using batches of
[14:22.080 --> 14:23.960]  the same seed that come out at use.
[14:24.080 --> 14:25.720]  So you got your male and female, you breed them.
[14:25.840 --> 14:27.520]  I like this little thing where you make more seeds.
[14:28.000 --> 14:29.280]  You put the male and female together.
[14:29.960 --> 14:31.160]  Again, you make more seeds.
[14:31.160 --> 14:32.160]  You just keep going forward.
[14:32.520 --> 14:36.720]  And the reason to do that is to stabilize across, uh, with a rise.
[14:36.800 --> 14:39.960]  I would like to get them all into that one phenotype that is real squat.
[14:39.960 --> 14:43.680]  It grows that one squatty bushy phenotype with a giant cola.
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.040]  It's got a lot of resin on it and it kind of smells like gassy ice cream.
[14:47.040 --> 14:49.440]  And I know that's a really weird description, but it's like, it's got a
[14:49.440 --> 14:51.800]  smoothness to it and a gas to it at the same time.
[14:52.160 --> 14:55.880]  So I'm going to find, and I've done a couple of generations.
[14:55.880 --> 14:57.240]  I just don't release a lot of things yet.
[14:57.240 --> 14:58.360]  I keep some things to myself.
[14:59.160 --> 15:02.600]  You got to find the F1 that looks like what you want it to be and find another
[15:02.600 --> 15:05.520]  male that looks like what you want it to be and breed those, and then you'll make
[15:05.520 --> 15:10.200]  the F2s and then find the F2 that grows like you want it to be, and then find the
[15:10.200 --> 15:12.120]  male that looks like you want it to be and breed those.
[15:12.520 --> 15:15.920]  And then every time you go, you should get it closer and closer to making
[15:15.920 --> 15:17.920]  clones, basically when you grow from seed.
[15:17.920 --> 15:22.120]  By the time you get to F4 or F5, you're going to be growing basically clones from
[15:22.120 --> 15:25.200]  seed, you'll throw out 10 seeds and they're all going to look very similar.
[15:25.600 --> 15:27.360]  Very similar, almost clone-like.
[15:27.640 --> 15:30.880]  So that's why you would want to move forward with a filial generation
[15:30.960 --> 15:32.280]  with brother and sister fucking.
[15:32.680 --> 15:35.040]  Now, why would you want to do a BX?
[15:35.040 --> 15:36.360]  That's a really good question.
[15:37.720 --> 15:38.960]  Here's a really good example.
[15:39.440 --> 15:42.400]  Golden goat is a clone only strain.
[15:42.400 --> 15:45.120]  There is no male of golden goat in existence.
[15:45.120 --> 15:48.600]  The person that made that put out the best golden goat and got rid of the rest
[15:48.600 --> 15:51.480]  of it, honestly, I don't know what he did, but that's never been released.
[15:51.920 --> 15:55.080]  Nobody's got access to a male golden goat other than the guy that made golden
[15:55.080 --> 15:56.000]  goat, whose name is Mr.
[15:56.000 --> 15:56.320]  Dank.
[15:56.560 --> 15:58.080]  A lot of people like to think I did that.
[15:58.160 --> 15:59.240]  That was not my creation.
[15:59.240 --> 15:59.880]  A guy named Mr.
[15:59.880 --> 16:00.480]  Dank did that.
[16:00.840 --> 16:05.400]  So there's no male golden goat, but perhaps a lot of people would like golden
[16:05.400 --> 16:06.160]  goat seeds.
[16:06.280 --> 16:08.760]  I know they would because they ask me for it all the time.
[16:09.400 --> 16:13.000]  What's the best way to get some golden goat seeds without fucking up golden goat
[16:13.000 --> 16:13.560]  too much?
[16:13.920 --> 16:18.120]  You would have to take a golden goat female and pollinate it with a male
[16:18.120 --> 16:19.680]  plant that is not golden goat.
[16:20.720 --> 16:24.640]  So now perhaps I did that with daybreaker and I made a rise.
[16:24.720 --> 16:25.000]  All right.
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.240]  So I've got a golden goat to daybreaker, which wouldn't have been the best idea.
[16:28.280 --> 16:31.560]  My intention here wasn't make to make a BX, but this is just a good example.
[16:31.840 --> 16:34.160]  Golden goat to daybreaker made a rise.
[16:34.440 --> 16:40.240]  Now, if I wanted to get golden goat closer to golden goat seeds, I would take a male,
[16:40.320 --> 16:44.520]  a rise that looked a lot like golden goat that had those long, skinny, shitty
[16:44.520 --> 16:44.960]  leaves.
[16:45.280 --> 16:47.880]  And then I would put that pollen on the female golden goat.
[16:47.880 --> 16:49.240]  And now I've just back-crossed it.
[16:50.320 --> 16:55.640]  And the reason I'd want to do that is now I'm going to make seeds that have two.
[16:55.720 --> 16:59.000]  So there's golden goat right here that I just pollinated.
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.320]  Plus there's golden goat and daybreaker and this other one.
[17:01.320 --> 17:04.400]  So now there's two chances of getting two out of three chances of getting golden goat
[17:04.400 --> 17:06.160]  style dominant phenotypes.
[17:06.240 --> 17:08.040]  I'm going to see a lot of golden goat traits out of that.
[17:08.360 --> 17:14.400]  66% hypothetically, hopefully if I do it right, hopefully about 66%.
[17:14.760 --> 17:19.440]  So then I would grow those and out of that batch of seeds, I would find the best
[17:19.440 --> 17:24.280]  looking male, the one that looked like the golden goat male closest to golden goat.
[17:24.280 --> 17:27.120]  And I would use that and I would repollinate that golden goat female.
[17:27.680 --> 17:31.320]  And those seeds are going to be very close to golden goat.
[17:31.760 --> 17:33.320]  So that's why you would do a BX.
[17:33.320 --> 17:36.840]  You're trying to make a strain that is clone only into a seed form.
[17:36.840 --> 17:39.880]  People say, couldn't you just reverse it and make feminized seeds?
[17:40.200 --> 17:41.000]  Yes, you could.
[17:41.200 --> 17:44.400]  But a lot of people do not want feminized seeds.
[17:44.560 --> 17:45.960]  They would rather have a BX.
[17:46.160 --> 17:53.280]  So that is the difference between making F2s, F3s, F4s and so forth versus
[17:53.400 --> 17:55.520]  back-crossing your genetics.
[17:55.720 --> 17:56.960]  I hope I taught that correctly.
[17:56.960 --> 17:57.960]  I hope you learned something.
[17:57.960 --> 17:59.160]  I hope you had a lot of fun with me.
[17:59.440 --> 18:02.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for hanging out with me on a Thursday quickie.
[18:02.440 --> 18:04.000]  I will be at the Dude Grows Cup.
[18:04.040 --> 18:04.480]  That's right.
[18:04.760 --> 18:05.840]  The Dude Grows Cup.
[18:05.880 --> 18:06.960]  I will be there hanging out.
[18:06.960 --> 18:07.520]  Look for me.
[18:07.520 --> 18:08.320]  I'm easy to find.
[18:08.320 --> 18:09.880]  I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks.
[18:10.320 --> 18:12.080]  You'll recognize my voice if nothing else.
[18:12.240 --> 18:12.840]  Don't be shy.
[18:12.840 --> 18:14.040]  Walk up, introduce yourself.
[18:14.240 --> 18:15.080]  Tell me your real name.
[18:15.080 --> 18:17.000]  If you're on Instagram, tell me your Instagram name.
[18:17.200 --> 18:17.800]  Let's hang out.
[18:18.000 --> 18:19.040]  Let's take some dabs.
[18:19.160 --> 18:20.320]  I want to see what you grew.
[18:20.520 --> 18:21.920]  I want to smoke some of what you grew.
[18:22.400 --> 18:23.160]  I'll share with you.
[18:23.240 --> 18:24.040]  You share with me.
[18:24.720 --> 18:26.440]  Maybe I'll have some seeds in my backpack.
[18:26.720 --> 18:27.560]  You never know.
[18:27.840 --> 18:30.920]  I hope to see you guys at the Dude Grows Cup.
[18:31.200 --> 18:34.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget about the 420 sale at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[18:34.560 --> 18:35.040]  That's right.
[18:36.440 --> 18:37.600]  The Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[18:37.600 --> 18:38.800]  Dankseed.store.
[18:38.840 --> 18:42.480]  If you buy four five packs of IRI Genetics, you'll get a free five pack of
[18:42.480 --> 18:47.040]  Cactus Cooler Across to Arise, plus another free five pack that will be chosen by my
[18:47.040 --> 18:49.520]  friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[18:49.640 --> 18:54.000]  So make sure you check out the 420 sale at Dankseed.store.
[18:54.280 --> 18:57.560]  Also, my friends at PL Grow Systems are running a 420 special.
[18:57.920 --> 19:02.960]  You guys use coupon code GFYH420 and you'll get 20% off.
[19:03.400 --> 19:07.600]  This offer runs from April 16th through April 23rd.
[19:07.640 --> 19:09.120]  Sorry, I had to make sure I read that correctly.
[19:09.280 --> 19:11.240]  April 16th through April 23rd.
[19:11.720 --> 19:15.960]  And check out PLGrow.systems for all of the information that you need there.
[19:16.160 --> 19:18.400]  You guys, PL Grow Systems, they keep my grow.
[19:19.320 --> 19:20.280]  They keep me comfortable.
[19:20.440 --> 19:21.760]  They keep my mind at ease.
[19:21.880 --> 19:23.600]  They keep my grow regulated.
[19:23.800 --> 19:28.000]  And that's something that myself, a guy that runs from grow to grow, from place to
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.960]  place, that wants to go places on the weekends, that wants to have a social life,
[19:30.960 --> 19:33.440]  that is recording a podcast and can't look at my grows right now.
[19:34.040 --> 19:37.720]  The PL Grow Minder is something that really helps me out.
[19:37.720 --> 19:39.680]  So make sure you check out PLGrow.systems.
[19:40.040 --> 19:43.720]  Use the coupon code GFYH420 and you'll get 20% off.
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.960]  Once again, that runs from April 16th through April 23rd of 2018.
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.760]  I've got to include that because podcasts last forever now.
[19:53.520 --> 19:56.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, make sure you follow me on all of the social media.
[19:56.320 --> 19:57.280]  Check me out on Facebook.
[19:57.280 --> 19:58.280]  Check me out on Instagram.
[19:58.480 --> 19:59.360]  Check me out on Twitter.
[19:59.560 --> 20:02.960]  If you've got something to say and you were not into all of the social media, you
[20:02.960 --> 20:03.760]  can send me an email.
[20:03.760 --> 20:06.600]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[20:06.760 --> 20:12.160]  By the time you listen to this, I will probably have 215-ish videos posted up to
[20:12.160 --> 20:12.760]  YouTube.
[20:13.040 --> 20:14.120]  I've got the new MacBook.
[20:14.360 --> 20:18.040]  It is increasing my video production speed drastically.
[20:18.040 --> 20:19.600]  So make sure you check out the YouTube channel.
[20:19.680 --> 20:22.280]  Simply search for grow from your heart.
[20:22.560 --> 20:24.000]  Also, don't forget about Patreon.
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.000]  If you feel like you'd like to contribute, if you feel like you would like to
[20:27.000 --> 20:28.080]  contribute, that makes sense.
[20:28.080 --> 20:28.640]  Yeah, do that.
[20:28.920 --> 20:32.320]  If you feel like you would like to financially contribute to this podcast, you
[20:32.320 --> 20:36.240]  can do so by going to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[20:36.640 --> 20:38.200]  You can contribute to the podcast.
[20:38.720 --> 20:39.760]  I did get the MacBook.
[20:40.000 --> 20:41.480]  Patreon didn't completely cover that.
[20:41.480 --> 20:44.840]  That was a little bit of Rasta Jeff, but Patreon helped out tremendously and made
[20:44.840 --> 20:45.480]  it possible.
[20:45.720 --> 20:48.640]  If you'd like to help me cover the entire cost of the MacBook and keep that going,
[20:48.640 --> 20:51.520]  you can go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[20:51.520 --> 20:53.440]  All of the information that you need will be right there.
[20:53.640 --> 20:55.920]  I will also use that funding to keep the website alive.
[20:56.120 --> 20:58.360]  I'll also use that funding to upgrade some of the equipment over here.
[20:58.360 --> 20:59.040]  That's going to crap.
[20:59.040 --> 21:02.560]  Sometimes I have to replace this headphone amplifier quite frequently.
[21:02.960 --> 21:08.040]  Uh, but anyway, patreon.com if you would like to support the podcast, ladies and
[21:08.040 --> 21:10.920]  gentlemen, I'll be back Monday with a fresh new episode.
[21:10.920 --> 21:13.160]  I think that's all that I've got for you this week.
[21:13.400 --> 21:15.120]  Who are we going to give a shout out to?
[21:15.760 --> 21:18.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Brett from
[21:18.600 --> 21:19.480]  the dude grows.
[21:19.480 --> 21:23.400]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
