[00:56.340 --> 01:02.340]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:02.340 --> 01:03.340]  Today was a long day.
[01:03.340 --> 01:05.740]  I've done a lot of podcasting and a lot of hanging out.
[01:05.740 --> 01:08.300]  I was on a couple of other podcasts earlier.
[01:08.300 --> 01:09.820]  Big shout out to the Dude Grows show.
[01:09.820 --> 01:13.900]  I hung out with Scotty Real and Guru and James Bean earlier today.
[01:13.900 --> 01:15.780]  Took a few dabs on that show.
[01:15.780 --> 01:17.380]  Took a few dabs throughout the day.
[01:17.380 --> 01:18.900]  I've been dabbing a lot of great stuff.
[01:18.900 --> 01:22.420]  I've been dabbing Crescendo Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[01:22.420 --> 01:25.420]  I've been dabbing some Chem Brûlé from Green Dot Labs.
[01:25.420 --> 01:29.820]  And of course, I've got a little bit of the Bananas Foster from Green Dot Labs.
[01:29.820 --> 01:30.940]  All of them are tremendous.
[01:30.940 --> 01:32.460]  All of them are delicious.
[01:32.460 --> 01:35.140]  That is why I seem heavily medicated today.
[01:35.140 --> 01:36.980]  It's been a long podcasting day.
[01:36.980 --> 01:39.660]  It was 95 for part of the day.
[01:39.660 --> 01:41.860]  It was a really hot day.
[01:41.860 --> 01:44.980]  I feel like it has cooled off quite a bit and it is time to do a good podcast.
[01:44.980 --> 01:46.460]  So let's jump right into it.
[01:46.460 --> 01:50.540]  This is the part of the show where we do shout outs to the members of the 710 Club.
[01:50.540 --> 01:56.420]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support the podcast on Patreon at the $7.10
[01:56.420 --> 01:58.040]  a month level or higher.
[01:58.040 --> 02:01.380]  So with no further ado, let's give a big grow from your heart podcast.
[02:01.380 --> 02:02.380]  Thank you.
[02:02.380 --> 02:03.380]  Shout out to my friend Aaron.
[02:03.380 --> 02:04.800]  Let's send a big grow from your heart podcast.
[02:04.960 --> 02:05.960]  Thank you.
[02:05.960 --> 02:06.960]  Shout out to Rasta K.

[02:13.440 --> 02:16.080]  I also want to send a thank you shout out to Juan Rios.

[02:19.800 --> 02:20.800]  Thank you for all the support.
[02:20.800 --> 02:23.800]  I also want to send a big thank you shout out to John B.
[02:23.800 --> 02:26.920]  Let's also send a big thank you shout out to Tonto's Garden.
[02:26.920 --> 02:29.720]  And also I want to send a thank you to Red Beard.
[02:29.720 --> 02:33.360]  Then last but certainly not least, I want to send a special thank you shout out to my
[02:33.360 --> 02:35.080]  friend Eric Ross.
[02:35.080 --> 02:36.080]  Big thanks.
[02:36.080 --> 02:38.920]  Big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[02:38.920 --> 02:42.360]  If you're not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[02:42.360 --> 02:48.280]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:48.280 --> 02:51.160]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.360]  Once again, big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports the show.
[02:55.360 --> 02:57.360]  All right, let's not waste too much time.
[02:57.360 --> 03:00.240]  I have got a lot of great questions for this episode.
[03:00.240 --> 03:05.000]  The first question on today's podcast goes just like this.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.400]  It says, Hey, I'll be in the live again.
[03:07.400 --> 03:08.720]  I just thought I'd try my luck.
[03:08.720 --> 03:10.440]  I can't find this information anywhere.
[03:10.440 --> 03:14.940]  So I think they're starting off by saying they found me through my Instagram live feed.
[03:14.940 --> 03:20.760]  Every Monday around 710pm Mountain Time, I jump on Instagram live and I hang out with
[03:20.760 --> 03:21.760]  my friends.
[03:21.760 --> 03:25.440]  I take a bunch of dabs and I ramble for about a solid hour.
[03:25.440 --> 03:26.960]  Instagram gives you one full hour.
[03:26.960 --> 03:29.440]  I'm there until they cut me off most of the time.
[03:29.440 --> 03:32.240]  I try to field all of the questions that come up in the chat.
[03:32.240 --> 03:35.280]  I have no way of predicting what may come up in the chat.
[03:35.280 --> 03:37.960]  So if you ask a question in the chat, I'll kind of answer it.
[03:37.960 --> 03:42.040]  If it's something I want to ramble on and rant on, I'll get going for a few minutes.
[03:42.040 --> 03:44.880]  Sometimes those mini rants turn into podcast episodes.
[03:44.880 --> 03:47.680]  It's a great way to connect with me and hang out Mondays on Instagram.
[03:47.680 --> 03:49.720]  I'm irie underscore genetics.
[03:49.720 --> 03:51.320]  Check us out there on Mondays.
[03:51.320 --> 03:52.680]  I do leave the videos up.
[03:52.680 --> 03:54.480]  So many of the older videos are up there.
[03:54.480 --> 03:56.080]  A couple of them got deleted.
[03:56.080 --> 03:59.340]  Shit happens with Instagram, but that's why we use cannabis.
[03:59.340 --> 04:00.340]  Just stay focused.
[04:00.340 --> 04:02.900]  Anyway, this listener was checking out the Instagram live.
[04:02.900 --> 04:05.740]  They're going to jump in again on another Monday and try to get their question answered,
[04:05.740 --> 04:09.700]  but have no fear because I'm going to read your question here on the show.
[04:09.700 --> 04:12.740]  It says I'm growing in cocoa, a four by four scrog.
[04:12.740 --> 04:16.960]  I just filled the net was going to flip to flower tomorrow, but I noticed powdery mildew
[04:16.960 --> 04:21.700]  on the lower and some of the other leaves I stripped and the lower big fan leaves at
[04:21.700 --> 04:22.700]  the bottom.
[04:22.700 --> 04:24.620]  And then it says, I will use a product.
[04:24.620 --> 04:26.140]  They listed the product on.
[04:26.140 --> 04:28.980]  Then it says, do I wait or do I begin flowering?
[04:28.980 --> 04:30.700]  I'm so grateful for any help.
[04:30.700 --> 04:33.180]  And I fully understand that you are busy.
[04:33.180 --> 04:35.100]  Stay blessed.
[04:35.100 --> 04:38.220]  I really believe that if you've got powdery mildew and you were considering flipping to
[04:38.220 --> 04:39.980]  flower, I would wait.
[04:39.980 --> 04:42.200]  I would wait until that problem is under control.
[04:42.200 --> 04:43.200]  Get that corrected.
[04:43.200 --> 04:45.660]  Get the, the issue at hand corrected.
[04:45.660 --> 04:48.460]  Get the reason causing the issue corrected.
[04:48.460 --> 04:50.000]  There's a reason why this is happening.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.180]  Something is incorrect in the room.
[04:51.180 --> 04:52.600]  The VPD is off.
[04:52.600 --> 04:55.620]  You're not evacuating humidity quickly enough.
[04:55.620 --> 04:56.620]  Something's going on in there.
[04:56.620 --> 04:57.960]  So we need to get more airflow.
[04:57.960 --> 04:59.520]  We need to remove humidity from the room.
[04:59.520 --> 05:03.280]  We need to solve the problem and also treat the plants at the same time.
[05:03.280 --> 05:04.800]  We can keep spraying the plants with shit.
[05:04.800 --> 05:07.880]  We can keep putting band-aids on the plants, but they will keep getting powdery mildew
[05:07.880 --> 05:09.680]  if we don't correct the room.
[05:09.680 --> 05:14.440]  So the overall solution is correct the room, then correct the plants or tree both at the
[05:14.440 --> 05:17.760]  same time, solve the problem, then go into flower.
[05:17.760 --> 05:20.040]  So set yourself up for success.
[05:20.040 --> 05:24.600]  If you put these plants into flower and they've got powdery mildew, it's going to get worse.
[05:24.600 --> 05:26.360]  The powdery mildew will get worse.
[05:26.360 --> 05:30.840]  And then your options for treating that powdery mildew will get minimized as time goes on.
[05:30.840 --> 05:36.400]  Once you got bud set, junkier buds, you cannot start doing different things for those powdery
[05:36.400 --> 05:37.400]  mildew problems.
[05:37.400 --> 05:39.800]  I got way off course there, but I think you know what I'm saying.
[05:39.800 --> 05:41.440]  Once we get buds, we can't spray with some shit.
[05:41.440 --> 05:43.680]  So we don't want to get buds now.
[05:43.680 --> 05:48.920]  We want to solve the problem, treat the plants, rid the room of the powdery mildew, then put
[05:48.920 --> 05:51.760]  the healthy, clean plants into flower.
[05:51.760 --> 05:53.300]  All right.
[05:53.300 --> 05:54.480]  We did not include your name.
[05:54.480 --> 05:57.740]  So I don't know who to thank for this great message, but I hope I gave you some good grow
[05:57.740 --> 05:58.740]  advice.
[05:58.740 --> 05:59.740]  Big thanks and big shout out.
[05:59.740 --> 06:03.260]  And I hope you have solved your powdery mildew problem.
[06:03.260 --> 06:05.140]  There are a lot of things you can do for the powdery mildew.
[06:05.140 --> 06:09.500]  Now I think that double nickel and cease are great products for that.
[06:09.500 --> 06:13.020]  There are a lot of great fungicides out there that will solve that problem depending on
[06:13.020 --> 06:14.020]  the intensity.
[06:14.020 --> 06:18.220]  But honestly, the main thing right now is to solve the problem.
[06:18.220 --> 06:21.660]  What is causing that powdery mildew in the room, we could spray the plants all day.
[06:21.660 --> 06:24.500]  But if we don't take care of the issue, it will keep coming back.
[06:24.500 --> 06:25.500]  All right.
[06:25.500 --> 06:27.500]  I've got another great message here in front of me.
[06:27.500 --> 06:29.220]  This one comes from our friend Tyler.
[06:29.220 --> 06:30.220]  What's up, Tyler?
[06:30.220 --> 06:31.380]  Been talking to you on social media.
[06:31.380 --> 06:32.960]  Hope you're doing well.
[06:32.960 --> 06:35.220]  This one goes, man, I'm a big fan of yours.
[06:35.220 --> 06:36.940]  I'm a big fan of yours as well, bro.
[06:36.940 --> 06:37.940]  Thank you.
[06:37.940 --> 06:40.020]  It says, I really hope to slab dab with you one day.
[06:40.020 --> 06:41.260]  Man, I'm getting older.
[06:41.260 --> 06:42.660]  Those slab dabs are killing me.
[06:42.660 --> 06:44.220]  Do you go through phases?
[06:44.220 --> 06:47.260]  This is just a side note, a good rant, a Rasta Jeff moment here.
[06:47.540 --> 06:51.660]  You go through phases where you can smoke all of the dabs and you don't get high.
[06:51.660 --> 06:56.260]  And then you go through phases where you can just open the jar and you get obliterated.
[06:56.260 --> 07:00.380]  This week has been one of the weeks where I take a dab and every dab has made me go,
[07:00.380 --> 07:01.380]  oh, shit.
[07:01.380 --> 07:02.540]  It's a great thing.
[07:02.540 --> 07:03.540]  It's been cost effective.
[07:03.540 --> 07:07.460]  Of course, today I smoked nearly three grams of concentrates today, but it's been a long
[07:07.460 --> 07:08.460]  day.
[07:08.460 --> 07:09.460]  Today is not a normal day.
[07:09.460 --> 07:14.100]  But this has been one of the phases where I just take a fat dab and my body's like,
[07:14.100 --> 07:15.100]  oh, you're high, bro.
[07:15.100 --> 07:16.700]  You should sit down for a minute.
[07:16.740 --> 07:17.980]  I'm not complaining.
[07:17.980 --> 07:21.420]  It's been, it's like I'm a cheap date lately, which is always nice because on those weeks
[07:21.420 --> 07:24.540]  when I smoke and smoke and smoke and nothing happens, I feel like I just burn through the
[07:24.540 --> 07:25.540]  concentrates.
[07:25.540 --> 07:28.220]  That gets quite expensive, a little bit spendy.
[07:28.220 --> 07:32.060]  But slab dab, bro, I'm smoking these diamonds in this batter.
[07:32.060 --> 07:33.900]  That gets expensive throwing down slab dabs.
[07:33.900 --> 07:34.900]  But if you're down, I'll try it.
[07:34.900 --> 07:35.900]  But I'm getting older, man.
[07:35.900 --> 07:37.500]  My lungs are going to blow out.
[07:37.500 --> 07:39.660]  Just know where the hospital is if we go too hard.
[07:39.660 --> 07:41.180]  It goes on to say, I have a question.
[07:41.180 --> 07:42.180]  Good.
[07:42.180 --> 07:43.180]  That's what we're here for.
[07:43.180 --> 07:47.300]  What one strain you would recommend of a fan of yours to buy so I can keep a mother to
[07:47.300 --> 07:49.300]  remember you by?
[07:49.300 --> 07:52.740]  Bro, am I dying and nobody told me?
[07:52.740 --> 07:55.260]  Why do you need something to remember me by?
[07:55.260 --> 07:56.260]  That's weird, bro.
[07:56.260 --> 07:57.260]  No, I get what you're saying.
[07:57.260 --> 08:00.860]  Just when you say it like that, it's just like, you make me feel like I'm fucking dying
[08:00.860 --> 08:02.100]  and nobody told me yet.
[08:02.100 --> 08:05.340]  What do you know that I don't know, bro?
[08:05.340 --> 08:08.980]  What one strain would I recommend to remember me by to grow a mother plant out of?
[08:08.980 --> 08:10.940]  And then they recommend orange chasm.
[08:10.940 --> 08:12.220]  It says I'd like to do that.
[08:12.260 --> 08:16.900]  I've got some mothers from my DGC free seed pack that mean more than anything.
[08:16.900 --> 08:20.420]  They mean more to me than the $200 packs I have purchased.
[08:20.420 --> 08:22.620]  You know, wow, that's a good sentence.
[08:22.620 --> 08:27.560]  I do like the big stony indica's greasy buds that press into turpy rosin are more important
[08:27.560 --> 08:30.380]  than profile of the high to me, honestly.
[08:30.380 --> 08:35.300]  So you prefer greasy buds with turpy rosin over the profile of the high.
[08:35.300 --> 08:36.300]  All right.
[08:36.300 --> 08:37.460]  And then it says, keep on rocking, brother.
[08:37.460 --> 08:39.940]  You're a real cool dude.
[08:39.940 --> 08:40.940]  Thank you, bro.
[08:40.940 --> 08:41.940]  I appreciate that.
[08:42.660 --> 08:43.660]  You're the fucker yourself.
[08:43.660 --> 08:46.900]  What am I going to recommend here for somebody that wants to remember me?
[08:46.900 --> 08:48.700]  You said stony indica.
[08:48.700 --> 08:52.420]  Most of what I breed is more of a real head racy sativa.
[08:52.420 --> 08:55.700]  I think the orange gas and maybe a really good thing to remember me by.
[08:55.700 --> 08:58.980]  Somebody made me a nice plaque, sent me a real nice letter.
[08:58.980 --> 09:00.980]  It had an orange gas and package in it.
[09:00.980 --> 09:03.540]  Lately, orange gas and has been the hit.
[09:03.540 --> 09:05.740]  Orange gas and has been the best seller out of all of them.
[09:05.740 --> 09:07.880]  The photos have been fucking amazing.
[09:07.880 --> 09:10.160]  So that may be a good one to remember me by.
[09:10.160 --> 09:11.700]  Of course, there is lemon Jeffrey.
[09:12.460 --> 09:13.460]  It's got my name on the damn package.
[09:13.460 --> 09:14.660]  So maybe lemon Jeffrey.
[09:14.660 --> 09:15.660]  It's tall.
[09:15.660 --> 09:17.380]  It smells funny and it will kick your ass.
[09:17.380 --> 09:23.900]  So lemon Jeffrey, you know, but stony indicas, I would say maybe morning dew since you want
[09:23.900 --> 09:26.180]  that indica, that indica funk.
[09:26.180 --> 09:31.580]  And then you said a stony profile more important than the high turpy rosin, more important
[09:31.580 --> 09:32.900]  than the profile of the high.
[09:32.900 --> 09:37.300]  So yeah, you're going to get that skunky funkiness.
[09:37.300 --> 09:38.860]  But also stony indica.
[09:38.860 --> 09:41.060]  I think morning dew may be the one for you.
[09:41.420 --> 09:44.140]  If you want the oranges, go for the orange gas.
[09:44.140 --> 09:47.700]  If you want more of a skunky stony thing, that's when I would say go for the morning
[09:47.700 --> 09:48.700]  dew.
[09:48.700 --> 09:49.700]  So those are the two of the three.
[09:49.700 --> 09:51.340]  I put lemon Jeffrey in there as well.
[09:51.340 --> 09:54.100]  So man, it really sounds like I'm dying and nobody told me about it.
[09:54.100 --> 09:55.360]  That's what's on my mind now.
[09:55.360 --> 09:57.780]  So those are the three strains I would recommend for you, Tyler.
[09:57.780 --> 10:00.660]  I hope I answered your question well.
[10:00.660 --> 10:03.200]  Orange gas because it's just been a hit lately.
[10:03.200 --> 10:06.440]  It's been my number one seller, which means you guys love it, which means I'm obviously
[10:06.440 --> 10:07.820]  in love with it, which means it's a hit.
[10:07.820 --> 10:09.620]  It's going to keep getting made.
[10:09.620 --> 10:12.180]  Lemon Jeffrey's got my name in it because I really love that cross.
[10:12.180 --> 10:16.100]  The limonene is beautiful for me, but you prefer something more indica.
[10:16.100 --> 10:18.260]  That's why I'm going to say morning dew for you.
[10:18.260 --> 10:21.060]  All right, Tyler, I hope I answered your question well.
[10:21.060 --> 10:22.900]  Big thank you for the Patreon support.
[10:22.900 --> 10:26.540]  Look forward to hearing from you again in the Patreon messages.
[10:26.540 --> 10:27.540]  That's right, you guys.
[10:27.540 --> 10:28.980]  I answer a lot of messages.
[10:28.980 --> 10:32.220]  The easiest way to get in touch with me is through Patreon.
[10:32.220 --> 10:34.180]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[10:34.180 --> 10:35.900]  All of the info you need is there.
[10:35.900 --> 10:41.700]  I do try to answer all of those Patreon messages on at least a bi-weekly basis.
[10:41.700 --> 10:44.100]  We've got another great message here from Patreon.
[10:44.100 --> 10:47.980]  It says, hey, my friend, thanks for answering about my herbs now dryer.
[10:47.980 --> 10:49.860]  I've heard it works great.
[10:49.860 --> 10:53.340]  I did mention an herbs dryer machine on the podcast before.
[10:53.340 --> 10:55.300]  I said that I may not be a fan of it.
[10:55.300 --> 10:57.140]  When I said that, I didn't think I would like it.
[10:57.140 --> 11:00.740]  So many people sent me messages saying, bro, you should really try it out.
[11:00.740 --> 11:01.740]  It's a great product.
[11:01.740 --> 11:02.740]  I use it.
[11:02.740 --> 11:03.740]  I love it.
[11:03.740 --> 11:04.740]  So I may stand corrected.
[11:04.740 --> 11:08.460]  I've tried it myself, so I can't endorse it, but I've gotten a lot of positive reviews
[11:08.460 --> 11:10.940]  and nobody has told me that they do not like it.
[11:10.940 --> 11:12.420]  So that's a great thing.
[11:12.420 --> 11:17.260]  It goes on to say, I'm listening to you and Mike right now on 820, 2020.
[11:17.260 --> 11:19.180]  The freestyle shows like these are really cool.
[11:19.180 --> 11:23.260]  And I just want to tell you, I appreciate you helping me get through work.
[11:23.260 --> 11:24.940]  Ah, man, thank you.
[11:24.940 --> 11:26.380]  And I know exactly how that feels.
[11:26.380 --> 11:30.220]  I used to run commercial cultivation facilities and sometimes the days would just freaking
[11:30.220 --> 11:32.820]  drag on and I would put Joe Rogan in my ear.
[11:32.820 --> 11:36.540]  I would put the dude grows crew in my ear and those guys would make the day go by.
[11:36.540 --> 11:37.540]  So thank you.
[11:37.540 --> 11:39.180]  I'm glad I'm able to do that for you.
[11:39.180 --> 11:40.180]  Thank you for noticing it.
[11:40.180 --> 11:41.180]  Thank you for listening.
[11:41.180 --> 11:43.140]  And obviously thank you for the Patreon support.
[11:43.140 --> 11:48.300]  It says you always talk about wondering what people do, what people do that they can listen
[11:48.300 --> 11:49.860]  to this podcast as they work.
[11:49.860 --> 11:50.860]  Yeah.
[11:50.860 --> 11:51.860]  What are you doing all day, bro?
[11:51.860 --> 11:55.020]  It says I'm a professional powder coder and wet painter.
[11:55.020 --> 11:59.740]  And I listened to your podcast while I paint military vehicle parts as well as medical
[11:59.740 --> 12:00.740]  equipment.
[12:00.740 --> 12:01.740]  Wow.
[12:01.740 --> 12:02.740]  That is cool.
[12:03.660 --> 12:04.660]  I'm a professional powder coating.
[12:04.660 --> 12:05.660]  I don't know what powder coating is.
[12:05.660 --> 12:06.660]  My uncle, he's gone now.
[12:06.660 --> 12:07.660]  Love you, Eric.
[12:07.660 --> 12:08.660]  Rest in peace, bro.
[12:08.660 --> 12:09.660]  A lot of my family, damn grandma too.
[12:09.660 --> 12:10.660]  I love you, grandma.
[12:10.660 --> 12:11.660]  The rest of peace, grandma shit.
[12:11.660 --> 12:14.500]  A lot of them worked at a place in California where they did powder coating.
[12:14.500 --> 12:18.180]  I was lucky enough to get some bike parts, bike parts, powder coated.
[12:18.180 --> 12:20.060]  You say that three times fast.
[12:20.060 --> 12:23.100]  I had some bike parts, powder coated and my bike looked fucking cool.
[12:23.100 --> 12:26.180]  I had solar black handlebars, solar black forks.
[12:26.180 --> 12:29.460]  Nobody in town knew what was up with my powder coated handlebars and forks.
[12:29.460 --> 12:30.460]  That was cool.
[12:30.460 --> 12:32.140]  But so I know what powder coating is.
[12:32.540 --> 12:35.020]  It's gotta be fun painting military vehicles and medical equipment.
[12:35.020 --> 12:38.420]  I bet you get a lot of quality paint, a lot of fun experience.
[12:38.420 --> 12:40.300]  You get to see a lot of great shit.
[12:40.300 --> 12:42.540]  You don't just paint the same random shit every day.
[12:42.540 --> 12:43.540]  That's probably cool.
[12:43.540 --> 12:45.580]  I'm going to quit rambling and focus on the message here.
[12:45.580 --> 12:48.980]  It goes on to say, I love what you are doing, man.
[12:48.980 --> 12:52.180]  And I am starting a podcast now to help spread content.
[12:52.180 --> 12:55.460]  And I'm interviewing master growers who run facilities.
[12:55.460 --> 12:57.820]  And I'm also interviewing breeders.
[12:57.820 --> 12:58.820]  It's a good idea.
[12:58.820 --> 12:59.820]  I like that.
[12:59.820 --> 13:00.820]  I want to do more interviews.
[13:00.820 --> 13:02.620]  I just don't feel confident.
[13:02.620 --> 13:03.620]  Everybody says, just do it.
[13:03.620 --> 13:05.340]  You're talking to, you can interview people.
[13:05.340 --> 13:08.620]  I feel like I cut people off and I'm going to get more people on the show.
[13:08.620 --> 13:10.060]  I promise you it will happen.
[13:10.060 --> 13:11.380]  I had a couple obstacles in the way.
[13:11.380 --> 13:12.380]  I think we're clearing those up.
[13:12.380 --> 13:13.380]  We're going to get it going.
[13:13.380 --> 13:14.380]  Let me keep going here.
[13:14.380 --> 13:18.540]  It says, I aspire to be as big in the podcast world as you.
[13:18.540 --> 13:23.820]  And maybe if I get a big following, I can have you on the show.
[13:23.820 --> 13:26.420]  Feels weird when you say get as big in the podcast world as me.
[13:26.420 --> 13:28.380]  I'm just a little show bro.
[13:28.380 --> 13:33.380]  As I pop up in the top 100 on Stitcher and the education category, just a little show,
[13:33.380 --> 13:36.060]  just a normal dude doing my thing, a one man production here.
[13:36.060 --> 13:38.860]  I do appreciate that you think it's a giant thing.
[13:38.860 --> 13:42.300]  I try to stay humble and realize it's just a guy in a microphone doing what I meant to
[13:42.300 --> 13:43.300]  do.
[13:43.300 --> 13:44.540]  I appreciate that.
[13:44.540 --> 13:49.120]  As for getting me on your podcast, I've got a better idea.
[13:49.120 --> 13:51.540]  And this may, this, I'm not trying to sound egotistical here.
[13:51.540 --> 13:55.140]  This is really the way that I think it would work for both of us marketing wise, instead
[13:55.140 --> 13:57.200]  of me going on your show.
[13:57.200 --> 13:58.880]  Not many people know of your show.
[13:58.880 --> 13:59.880]  It's new.
[13:59.880 --> 14:00.880]  That's how it goes.
[14:00.880 --> 14:02.640]  New shows, not a big exposure, not a big audience.
[14:02.640 --> 14:04.280]  Nobody knows about you yet.
[14:04.280 --> 14:05.280]  People are listening to the show.
[14:05.280 --> 14:07.480]  You say you want to be as big as my show?
[14:07.480 --> 14:08.480]  Come on my show.
[14:08.480 --> 14:10.840]  Tell us about your show on my show.
[14:10.840 --> 14:11.840]  Expose yourself.
[14:11.840 --> 14:12.840]  Don't expose yourself.
[14:12.840 --> 14:15.320]  Keep your clothes on, expose your show to my audience.
[14:15.320 --> 14:18.720]  And that way people can hear you on my show and my audience will hear you.
[14:18.720 --> 14:22.800]  If I go on your show, chances are, and this is where it sounds egotistical, chances are
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.000]  your small new audience knows of my bigger show already.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.360]  So you're going to get more benefit if you come here and we'll spread you to a bigger
[14:29.360 --> 14:31.480]  audience, just a larger catapult.
[14:31.480 --> 14:32.480]  We'll get you going.
[14:32.480 --> 14:34.920]  And then you can post the episode where you're on my show.
[14:34.920 --> 14:37.920]  I'll give you permission to post that episode on your feed.
[14:37.920 --> 14:41.180]  So you can get Ross to Jeff on your feed, have your interview up there.
[14:41.180 --> 14:42.180]  You get free content.
[14:42.180 --> 14:44.520]  You get a whole new episode for your feed that way.
[14:44.520 --> 14:45.560]  We call it a swap cast.
[14:45.560 --> 14:47.520]  We both get a show out of our time.
[14:47.520 --> 14:48.520]  Works well.
[14:48.520 --> 14:49.520]  We'll both get exposure.
[14:49.520 --> 14:52.000]  But I think that's the way to do it is get you up here on my show.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.440]  I'll make a little intro for it, put the music on it and stuff, make it look real killer.
[14:56.040 --> 14:57.360]  But no offense to your show or anything.
[14:57.360 --> 15:01.760]  I just think that marketing wise, that is probably the better strategy is to have you
[15:01.760 --> 15:05.480]  come be on the show via Zoom, something like that.
[15:05.480 --> 15:07.480]  I think, I hope that works for you.
[15:07.480 --> 15:08.920]  By the way, I'm going to mention the name of your show.
[15:08.920 --> 15:10.840]  It says the show is called Talking Buds.
[15:10.840 --> 15:12.520]  I'm going to have to check that out for you.
[15:12.520 --> 15:16.860]  It says first episode wasn't great quality, but it is all on the platforms if you ever
[15:16.860 --> 15:18.360]  bored and want to check it out.
[15:18.360 --> 15:23.060]  You guys, there's a new podcast out there called Talking Buds with a Z, B-U-D-Z.
[15:23.060 --> 15:24.280]  It's on all of the platforms.
[15:24.280 --> 15:28.360]  Z says it's poor quality, but you know what's cool about a poor quality first podcast is
[15:28.360 --> 15:30.760]  means you got fucking plenty of room for improvement.
[15:30.760 --> 15:34.640]  If you put out that fucking number 10 on the first episode, you wouldn't have anything
[15:34.640 --> 15:35.640]  else to do.
[15:35.640 --> 15:38.400]  You'd have to keep putting out fucking 10s and it's hard.
[15:38.400 --> 15:40.280]  I put out like solid eights, nines.
[15:40.280 --> 15:44.160]  I try for 10s, but 10s are, I think 10s are fucking, that's doing something.
[15:44.160 --> 15:46.320]  I put out eights and nines every week, twice a week.
[15:46.320 --> 15:47.840]  If it was a seven, I rerecord it.
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.320]  I don't mean we won't get a seven, but don't be upset with yourself about putting out a
[15:52.320 --> 15:54.240]  sub par first episode.
[15:54.240 --> 15:55.240]  It's totally legit.
[15:55.240 --> 15:56.240]  You could do that.
[15:56.240 --> 15:58.200]  You got nowhere to go but up from there.
[15:58.200 --> 15:59.440]  I'm going to get back on track.
[15:59.440 --> 16:04.760]  It says, but I'm trying to help get rid of the stigma from cannabis and you and my white
[16:04.760 --> 16:07.520]  mic have helped push me to do my part.
[16:07.520 --> 16:09.240]  Have an iry day, homie.
[16:09.240 --> 16:10.240]  Much love.
[16:10.240 --> 16:11.240]  Sorry for rambling.
[16:11.240 --> 16:14.160]  Bro, never be sorry for rambling in an email to me.
[16:14.160 --> 16:19.800]  I am one of the kings as I think the cool kids now say I'm the CEO of rambling.
[16:19.800 --> 16:21.920]  So I'll be the CEO.
[16:21.920 --> 16:23.280]  Don't ever be shy to ramble to me.
[16:23.320 --> 16:25.160]  I like it when we ramble.
[16:25.160 --> 16:26.500]  Podcasting is just people talking.
[16:26.500 --> 16:29.680]  So sometimes the side tangents are where the fucking gold comes out.
[16:29.680 --> 16:31.800]  So I appreciate your message.
[16:31.800 --> 16:35.280]  Thank you for starting a podcast and thank you for acknowledging that Mike and I were
[16:35.280 --> 16:36.280]  a big inspiration.
[16:36.280 --> 16:37.480]  Mike, do you hear that bro?
[16:37.480 --> 16:40.160]  We helped this guy get inspired to start a podcast.
[16:40.160 --> 16:41.160]  I like it.
[16:41.160 --> 16:42.160]  We should listen.
[16:42.160 --> 16:45.320]  I'm going to leave this note here on the side of the table and I'm going to check out talking
[16:45.320 --> 16:46.720]  buds.
[16:46.720 --> 16:48.520]  Maybe I'll give you an episode or two to get going.
[16:48.520 --> 16:52.840]  But like I said, bro, get a couple episodes under your belt in the feed.
[16:53.400 --> 16:55.040]  Maybe three to five episodes have something going on.
[16:55.040 --> 16:56.160]  I'll listen to all of them.
[16:56.160 --> 16:57.160]  I'll have some content.
[16:57.160 --> 16:58.160]  I'll know about you a little bit.
[16:58.160 --> 16:59.160]  We'll get you on my show.
[16:59.160 --> 17:02.680]  We'll just do like a 20 minute little talk, maybe 30 minutes or so.
[17:02.680 --> 17:04.240]  Talk about you, talk about your show.
[17:04.240 --> 17:06.960]  We'll pitch each other real quick and then we'll send you on your merry way and then
[17:06.960 --> 17:09.000]  we'll post it on both of our feeds.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.600]  But do that once you got a couple of episodes going up, we could check them out and see
[17:11.600 --> 17:12.600]  what you got going on.
[17:12.600 --> 17:16.160]  Of course, you got to have something for me to check out before I could really fully endorse
[17:16.160 --> 17:17.160]  you.
[17:17.160 --> 17:19.080]  That may get crazy to bring you on the show and you're just completely crazy.
[17:19.080 --> 17:20.080]  That could be fun.
[17:20.080 --> 17:21.080]  Fuck it.
[17:21.080 --> 17:22.080]  Let's do it.
[17:22.320 --> 17:23.320]  All right.
[17:23.320 --> 17:24.320]  Contact me again, bro.
[17:24.320 --> 17:27.800]  I'll check out your show and we will get our new friend from what's it called?
[17:27.800 --> 17:29.240]  Talking Buds podcast on the show.
[17:29.240 --> 17:30.240]  I'll let him interview me.
[17:30.240 --> 17:31.880]  I'll interview him at the same time.
[17:31.880 --> 17:32.880]  It'll be a good time.
[17:32.880 --> 17:34.360]  We'll tag team the whole show.
[17:34.360 --> 17:35.360]  It'll be fun.
[17:35.360 --> 17:36.360]  All right.
[17:36.360 --> 17:37.360]  Thank you for the message, bro.
[17:37.360 --> 17:38.360]  Did you include a name here?
[17:38.360 --> 17:39.360]  Whose name do you want me to say?
[17:39.360 --> 17:40.360]  He didn't put a name here.
[17:40.360 --> 17:44.280]  So just once again, shout out to the Talking Buds podcast.
[17:44.280 --> 17:45.480]  They'll be on the show in the future.
[17:45.480 --> 17:46.480]  All right.
[17:46.480 --> 17:49.720]  We could both practice interviewing people on that episode and get a little more comfortable.
[17:49.720 --> 17:50.720]  All right.
[17:50.880 --> 17:51.880]  I do have another episode.
[17:51.880 --> 17:54.120]  I wish I had a whole nother episode.
[17:54.120 --> 17:56.940]  I've got another email here in front of me.
[17:56.940 --> 18:03.480]  This one comes from a person who calls themselves Monkey with a U and it goes, hey, Rasta Jeff,
[18:03.480 --> 18:05.040]  please note, let me make sure.
[18:05.040 --> 18:10.580]  Well, now he just said not to mention his identity, but bro, your name is Monkey.
[18:10.580 --> 18:11.580]  So that's cool.
[18:11.580 --> 18:13.320]  Long time fan of who?
[18:13.320 --> 18:17.320]  Long time fan who finally got the opportunity to purchase some of your genetics.
[18:17.320 --> 18:22.160]  I'm in week five of flower with the Golden Goat S1 and I have noticed many, many of the
[18:22.160 --> 18:25.040]  leaves have a bud growing from the center.
[18:25.040 --> 18:26.320]  I know what you're talking about.
[18:26.320 --> 18:28.640]  So he's got Golden Goat S1s.
[18:28.640 --> 18:30.620]  That is a Golden Goat Femini seed.
[18:30.620 --> 18:33.160]  He said that he has got, is it leaves or buds?
[18:33.160 --> 18:34.480]  Let me make sure which ones I've seen.
[18:34.480 --> 18:37.680]  Both of the leaves have a bud growing from the center.
[18:37.680 --> 18:38.680]  So you've got a leaf.
[18:38.680 --> 18:41.960]  So say your bud is coming up here and you've got a leaf coming out of the plant and then
[18:41.960 --> 18:43.240]  there's where it spreads out.
[18:43.240 --> 18:47.200]  It makes the fingery leaf right about the palm, but facing up, there's a little nugget
[18:47.280 --> 18:49.760]  farming, just one calyx farming right there.
[18:49.760 --> 18:50.760]  I've seen that.
[18:50.760 --> 18:55.840]  I think I know a common denominator of when and why that happens, but let's keep reading.
[18:55.840 --> 19:00.640]  It says, I was curious if this was a mutation that you had seen commonly.
[19:00.640 --> 19:02.480]  I've never seen this in the Golden Goat.
[19:02.480 --> 19:04.160]  I've seen this in Jack the Ripper.
[19:04.160 --> 19:09.600]  I've seen this in a few other strains, mostly sativa tropical type varietals is where I've
[19:09.600 --> 19:10.600]  seen it.
[19:10.600 --> 19:15.280]  It says I've been growing her organically using down to earth 444 for veg and Dr. Earth
[19:15.280 --> 19:17.840]  394 flower girl during flower.
[19:17.840 --> 19:23.320]  They are quite close to the lights as I am very limited in a very limited height area.
[19:23.320 --> 19:25.820]  So I figured it could easily be a stress issue.
[19:25.820 --> 19:27.760]  Amazing podcast and incredible work.
[19:27.760 --> 19:31.480]  I can't wait to finally try what I've heard so much about.
[19:31.480 --> 19:33.120]  You know, I've never seen that happen.
[19:33.120 --> 19:37.400]  And it's weird if you've got multiple phenotypes doing that because that is something happening
[19:37.400 --> 19:38.400]  in your room.
[19:38.400 --> 19:41.520]  If it was just one plant, I would say that's a total anomaly in the genetics.
[19:41.520 --> 19:43.340]  You've got multiple plants doing it in your room.
[19:43.340 --> 19:45.300]  It's something happening in there.
[19:45.300 --> 19:50.940]  Honestly, I think the reason for a plant to spit out extra buds like that is because it's
[19:50.940 --> 19:54.020]  super happy with life.
[19:54.020 --> 19:55.860]  It's like, bro, I'm so happy.
[19:55.860 --> 19:58.780]  Those parts of the plant that it's making are its reproductive organs.
[19:58.780 --> 20:00.140]  It's like, so happy.
[20:00.140 --> 20:01.460]  I'm so horny and happy.
[20:01.460 --> 20:06.420]  I'm going to make more sex organs on different parts just so I can get even hornier and have
[20:06.420 --> 20:07.900]  more happy parts.
[20:07.900 --> 20:09.460]  That's really what I think is happening.
[20:09.460 --> 20:10.780]  The plant is so happy.
[20:10.780 --> 20:14.820]  It's like, I've got so much light, so much nutrients, everything is dialed in so well.
[20:14.820 --> 20:16.620]  I'm just going to make more buds for this guy.
[20:16.620 --> 20:17.620]  Here you go.
[20:17.620 --> 20:19.300]  It's trying to give you more flowers.
[20:19.300 --> 20:20.300]  It's got so much energy.
[20:20.300 --> 20:22.180]  It doesn't know where to put those buds.
[20:22.180 --> 20:23.280]  So it popped up right there.
[20:23.280 --> 20:25.120]  That's really what I think is happening.
[20:25.120 --> 20:27.700]  There could be more of a scientific answer that I'm unaware of.
[20:27.700 --> 20:32.380]  But from what I've seen this happen, it is always tropical sativa varietal plants that
[20:32.380 --> 20:34.740]  were really, really happy.
[20:34.740 --> 20:36.180]  So that's what I think is happening.
[20:36.180 --> 20:37.180]  I don't think it's a problem.
[20:37.180 --> 20:39.020]  I think you've got happy plants.
[20:39.020 --> 20:41.060]  So Monkey, I want to thank you for the message.
[20:41.060 --> 20:42.060]  I would like an update.
[20:42.060 --> 20:43.620]  This was sent a little bit back.
[20:43.620 --> 20:46.740]  I'd like to see how this crop is doing, how it went.
[20:46.740 --> 20:48.180]  Send me some pictures.
[20:48.180 --> 20:50.540]  Send me an update on those Golden Goat S1s.
[20:50.540 --> 20:53.020]  I'd like to know how that went.
[20:53.020 --> 20:54.020]  All right.
[20:54.020 --> 20:57.100]  I'm going to get my voice together, get my thoughts together, and we're going to read
[20:57.100 --> 20:58.100]  another email.
[20:58.100 --> 21:01.100]  This one comes from, I don't know if they want their name said.
[21:01.100 --> 21:02.620]  It's got their full name here at the top.
[21:02.620 --> 21:04.100]  It says, hey, my name is Boosie.
[21:04.100 --> 21:05.100]  There we go.
[21:05.100 --> 21:06.100]  They gave us a good name.
[21:06.100 --> 21:08.380]  Feel free to use my name and this entire email.
[21:08.740 --> 21:09.740]  Thank you, bro.
[21:09.740 --> 21:12.700]  It says, I have a question about types of pollen or outcomes.
[21:12.700 --> 21:13.700]  All right.
[21:13.700 --> 21:15.580]  I love a good pollen question.
[21:15.580 --> 21:17.820]  Breeding questions are some of my favorites.
[21:17.820 --> 21:19.820]  I'll share a lot, but I keep some to myself.
[21:19.820 --> 21:20.820]  This one is going to be good.
[21:20.820 --> 21:24.580]  It says, it's hard to explain, but I will try my best.
[21:24.580 --> 21:25.580]  I'm in.
[21:25.580 --> 21:28.080]  It says, I have a strawberry, banana, female.
[21:28.080 --> 21:29.380]  So far I follow you.
[21:29.380 --> 21:31.780]  I also have a strawberry eclair female.
[21:31.780 --> 21:32.780]  All right.
[21:32.780 --> 21:35.060]  So you like strawberry flavored plants.
[21:35.060 --> 21:37.860]  You like strawberry banana, strawberry eclair.
[21:37.860 --> 21:39.540]  I feel like shit I could get into.
[21:39.540 --> 21:44.100]  It says, I plan on selfing each one to have seeds to store for the future.
[21:44.100 --> 21:45.700]  I follow you so far.
[21:45.700 --> 21:51.140]  If I take pollen from the bubblegum cut and add it to the eclair cut, would the phenol
[21:51.140 --> 21:57.180]  outcomes vary much if I would add pollen in the opposite eclair to bubblegum?
[21:57.180 --> 22:00.460]  Seems like a silly question, but I would like to hear your thoughts.
[22:00.460 --> 22:04.820]  Yes, there will be variation.
[22:04.820 --> 22:08.500]  It just depends on the dominance of the genetics that you're using.
[22:08.500 --> 22:12.620]  So both of those plants have grandparents or both those plants have parents, which are
[22:12.620 --> 22:14.700]  going to be grandparents of your new offspring.
[22:14.700 --> 22:20.620]  So your strawberry eclair and your strawberry banana have different, there's a different,
[22:20.620 --> 22:22.700]  at least one different parent in there, possibly two.
[22:22.700 --> 22:25.180]  I don't know what the cross, you got the word strawberry and both of them.
[22:25.180 --> 22:29.900]  I'm going to assume there's one common parent and then two different parents in there.
[22:29.900 --> 22:34.680]  So different phenotypes of those plants are going to show different expressions.
[22:35.540 --> 22:39.320]  And when you breed to them, you may see, so we took the grandparents, the grandparents,
[22:39.320 --> 22:41.340]  we made the new parents, we crossed those.
[22:41.340 --> 22:45.440]  You may see these grandparents come up in some phenotypes depending on the way that
[22:45.440 --> 22:46.440]  you did it.
[22:46.440 --> 22:50.300]  And it all depends on which grandpa and which grandma was more dominant and which mommy
[22:50.300 --> 22:52.000]  and which daddy was more dominant.
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.960]  So you've got the opportunity to see this plant, this plant, and these two plants on
[22:55.960 --> 22:56.960]  the family tree.
[22:56.960 --> 23:01.680]  So you can see mommy and you can see mommy's grandparents and you can see daddy and daddy's
[23:01.680 --> 23:04.920]  grandparents coming through some of those phenotypes.
[23:04.920 --> 23:08.320]  And it's all about which plant had the genetics.
[23:08.320 --> 23:11.940]  It's all, it's a gamble and a dice roll of which way those genetics are going to land.
[23:11.940 --> 23:17.800]  So you will see varying phenotypes depending on just how those genetics land.
[23:17.800 --> 23:18.800]  It's kind of a gamble.
[23:18.800 --> 23:19.880]  It's like putting up a chart.
[23:19.880 --> 23:23.720]  You get so many attribute points on this chart and they're going to fall in so many ways.
[23:23.720 --> 23:29.060]  You'll get a lot of common things, but then you may see on one side, you may see a grandfather
[23:29.060 --> 23:30.360]  trait really heavily.
[23:30.360 --> 23:34.360]  And on the other one, you could see the grandmother trait very heavily, or you may not see any
[23:34.360 --> 23:35.580]  of those traits.
[23:35.580 --> 23:36.880]  There will be variation.
[23:36.880 --> 23:38.720]  Yes, there will be variation.
[23:38.720 --> 23:42.060]  So it says, seems like a silly question, but I'd like to hear your thoughts.
[23:42.060 --> 23:43.680]  Not a silly question at all.
[23:43.680 --> 23:45.620]  I love it when people think about breeding like that.
[23:45.620 --> 23:48.760]  Those are some of my favorite questions.
[23:48.760 --> 23:52.360]  You've just, you've taken one ingredient and another ingredient.
[23:52.360 --> 23:55.960]  And if you just, if you mix things different ways, you're going to have different outcomes.
[23:55.960 --> 23:56.960]  Yes.
[23:56.960 --> 24:00.120]  Using the male, one way you'll get different resistance, possibly a different structure,
[24:00.880 --> 24:05.280]  maybe different aromas, just because that's what the male does to the cross, or at least
[24:05.280 --> 24:10.040]  the pollen donor will do to the cross and you'll unlock recessive traits and traits
[24:10.040 --> 24:11.480]  from the parents and grandparents.
[24:11.480 --> 24:14.040]  Like I keep saying, so you will see different things.
[24:14.040 --> 24:15.280]  Let me get myself back on track.
[24:15.280 --> 24:19.640]  It says on a random note, my buddy Ross, Dave and his family came to Colorado.
[24:19.640 --> 24:21.080]  What's up Ross today by, I remember you, bro.
[24:21.080 --> 24:22.080]  You got a beautiful family.
[24:22.080 --> 24:23.320]  The little kids are beautiful.
[24:23.320 --> 24:25.880]  Your wife was great, very nice and fun to hang out with.
[24:25.880 --> 24:27.680]  That sounds weird, but Dave was there too.
[24:27.680 --> 24:28.680]  So that's not how that sounded.
[24:29.240 --> 24:31.080]  I would like to say thank you a lot, sir.
[24:31.080 --> 24:32.080]  And jaw bless.
[24:32.080 --> 24:36.320]  We are from Missouri and everything is new and exciting here since we went medical.
[24:36.320 --> 24:37.800]  That was a cool little family.
[24:37.800 --> 24:40.320]  We did get to meet up, hung out in a parking lot for a few minutes.
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.480]  Got to share some love, a bunch of dreadheads in a parking lot, little tiny kids with dreadlocks
[24:44.480 --> 24:46.240]  that was adorable.
[24:46.240 --> 24:47.920]  The whole family was dreads except mama.
[24:47.920 --> 24:50.680]  She said she used to have dreads, but she'll get them back.
[24:50.680 --> 24:52.400]  I'm sure one day she'll have dreadies again.
[24:52.400 --> 24:54.920]  So shout out to the dreadlock family that came and hung out.
[24:54.920 --> 24:57.400]  Also shout out to our friend Boosie.
[24:57.400 --> 24:58.720]  Thanks for the great question.
[24:58.720 --> 25:01.640]  If you've got any more breeding questions, let me know.
[25:01.640 --> 25:02.640]  Something else I want to talk about.
[25:02.640 --> 25:07.440]  If you're going to preserve these, I would do them, do one plant for a reversal at a
[25:07.440 --> 25:08.440]  time.
[25:08.440 --> 25:10.600]  Don't have two males in the same room, in the same house at the same time.
[25:10.600 --> 25:11.600]  It'll get sloppy.
[25:11.600 --> 25:13.800]  There will be pollen contamination.
[25:13.800 --> 25:16.120]  You won't have the breeding project you think you have.
[25:16.120 --> 25:20.080]  So reverse either that Eclair or the strawberry other one.
[25:20.080 --> 25:21.080]  What was it?
[25:21.080 --> 25:22.080]  Strawberry bubblegum.
[25:22.080 --> 25:23.080]  Is that what you said?
[25:23.080 --> 25:24.080]  Where am I?
[25:24.080 --> 25:25.080]  I can't even read anymore.
[25:25.080 --> 25:26.480]  Strawberry banana and strawberry Eclair.
[25:26.560 --> 25:29.160]  Pick one, reverse it, pollinate both.
[25:29.160 --> 25:30.760]  You can pollinate both at the same time.
[25:30.760 --> 25:33.680]  They'll both be in the room, put the male plant in the middle, just knock it back and
[25:33.680 --> 25:36.800]  forth, pollinate both plants, then do the opposite next time.
[25:36.800 --> 25:40.800]  But do them at separate times so you've got a clear idea of which is who the baby daddy
[25:40.800 --> 25:41.800]  is.
[25:41.800 --> 25:42.800]  We always want to know who the baby daddy.
[25:42.800 --> 25:45.800]  We don't want to have to take these plants to Maury and figure out what you did.
[25:45.800 --> 25:46.800]  All right.
[25:46.800 --> 25:47.800]  So that is my advice.
[25:47.800 --> 25:49.720]  Thank you for the great question.
[25:49.720 --> 25:54.640]  And I look forward to meeting you the next time the dead crew comes through from Missouri.
[25:54.800 --> 25:56.800]  I hope things go well for you out there in Missouri as well.
[25:56.800 --> 25:59.400]  Good luck on the new medical cannabis venture.
[25:59.400 --> 26:00.400]  All right.
[26:00.400 --> 26:01.640]  Do we have time for one more?
[26:01.640 --> 26:03.880]  Of course we've got time for one more.
[26:03.880 --> 26:05.640]  Let's jump into one more.
[26:05.640 --> 26:06.640]  You know what?
[26:06.640 --> 26:09.760]  I've got a screenshot on my phone that I wanted to read.
[26:09.760 --> 26:10.960]  This is a great question.
[26:10.960 --> 26:11.960]  Here we go.
[26:11.960 --> 26:14.240]  This one says, who's this come from?
[26:14.240 --> 26:15.640]  I don't know if they want their name said on the show.
[26:15.640 --> 26:16.640]  So I'm going to keep that private.
[26:16.640 --> 26:17.640]  You know who you are.
[26:17.640 --> 26:18.640]  Thank you for the great question.
[26:18.640 --> 26:21.820]  It says, great show, great genetics.
[26:21.820 --> 26:23.760]  That's a way to start a message to me.
[26:23.880 --> 26:24.880]  Thank you.
[26:24.880 --> 26:25.880]  Great compliment.
[26:25.880 --> 26:29.080]  It says, I love listening to your show, Rasta Jeff, and I've got a quick breeding question.
[26:29.080 --> 26:30.080]  Here we go again.
[26:30.080 --> 26:31.080]  I love the breeding questions.
[26:31.080 --> 26:34.080]  It says, after pollinating, seeds are starting.
[26:34.080 --> 26:36.760]  Do you change the nutrients or the lighting?
[26:36.760 --> 26:39.020]  I hear you should start up veg newts again.
[26:39.020 --> 26:42.600]  I would like to know if there's any truth to that.
[26:42.600 --> 26:43.760]  So that's a really good question.
[26:43.760 --> 26:46.820]  This one could keep me talking for quite a few minutes.
[26:46.820 --> 26:48.840]  So he's got a crop that is seeded.
[26:48.840 --> 26:51.680]  Now at this point in time, we're not growing for flowers.
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.420]  We don't want buds with big, beautiful flowers and trichomes.
[26:55.420 --> 26:56.960]  That's not what we're growing for at this point.
[26:56.960 --> 26:58.900]  This grower is growing for seeds.
[26:58.900 --> 27:01.440]  We have now abandoned the idea of seedless bud.
[27:01.440 --> 27:02.760]  We're going seeded bud.
[27:02.760 --> 27:03.880]  It's a whole new project.
[27:03.880 --> 27:07.200]  So at this point, yes, I do recommend changing the nutrients.
[27:07.200 --> 27:10.200]  We need to focus a little bit more on growth and not buds and trichomes.
[27:10.200 --> 27:11.680]  We're not making big fat buds.
[27:11.680 --> 27:13.800]  We're making healthy seeds.
[27:13.800 --> 27:19.560]  So I would replace the flowering nutrients and I would put a vegetative nutrient in there.
[27:19.560 --> 27:21.200]  Keep doing the cow mag.
[27:21.200 --> 27:23.480]  Don't do the bud boosters like you would normally do.
[27:23.480 --> 27:26.400]  Instead of doing a bud booster, add amino acids.
[27:26.400 --> 27:28.800]  Amino acids are good building blocks for life.
[27:28.800 --> 27:30.600]  So that's what I would do.
[27:30.600 --> 27:31.680]  You may need some cow mag.
[27:31.680 --> 27:35.240]  You're going to want to keep that nitrogen going to keep the plants with a lot of energy,
[27:35.240 --> 27:37.240]  a lot of vigor, and a lot of momentum.
[27:37.240 --> 27:42.320]  And then they may want to go a little bit longer than you normally flower.
[27:42.320 --> 27:43.960]  So pay attention to the plants.
[27:43.960 --> 27:45.480]  Don't start flushing as early.
[27:45.480 --> 27:48.920]  You don't need to worry as much about flushing because we're not going to consume these flowers
[27:48.920 --> 27:49.920]  anyway.
[27:49.920 --> 27:50.920]  They're going to be filled with seeds.
[27:50.920 --> 27:54.880]  By the time you get the seeds out of there, it's mostly just dust and trash anyway.
[27:54.880 --> 27:56.320]  So I do change the feeding.
[27:56.320 --> 27:58.120]  I continue with the vegetative newts.
[27:58.120 --> 27:59.720]  I don't add bloom boosters.
[27:59.720 --> 28:01.480]  I add amino acids.
[28:01.480 --> 28:04.560]  I kind of increase the cow mag based on what I see the plants do.
[28:04.560 --> 28:07.840]  And then I pay a lot of attention to the plants.
[28:07.840 --> 28:08.840]  They're kind of, they're pregnant.
[28:08.840 --> 28:10.720]  So you got to treat them like a pregnant lady.
[28:10.720 --> 28:11.720]  Their needs are going to change.
[28:11.720 --> 28:16.400]  You have to learn how to identify those needs by watching the plants.
[28:16.400 --> 28:20.880]  Now for lighting, there are a few things you can do.
[28:20.880 --> 28:26.800]  If you are an experienced grower and you know what to watch for, you can change the lights.
[28:26.800 --> 28:29.700]  I don't talk about this a lot, but here we go.
[28:29.700 --> 28:31.400]  Come down this path with me.
[28:31.400 --> 28:35.480]  The last two weeks of flower, okay, we'll do it for the last three weeks of a seeded
[28:35.480 --> 28:36.480]  crop.
[28:36.480 --> 28:41.000]  You can turn your lights back on 18 and six for the last little bit of a seeded crop,
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.760]  and it will help those seeds bulk up and speed up.
[28:43.760 --> 28:47.240]  I do this earlier than I'm recommending because I'm very experienced with my plants.
[28:47.240 --> 28:48.240]  I know what to look for.
[28:48.240 --> 28:49.240]  I know how they're going to respond.
[28:49.240 --> 28:50.760]  I know what they're going to do.
[28:50.760 --> 28:53.800]  So like I said before, we're not growing for pretty buds.
[28:53.800 --> 28:58.160]  If you're not growing for buds, if your goal is seeds, you can turn the time after pollination
[28:58.160 --> 28:59.160]  has happened.
[28:59.160 --> 29:01.360]  After you see seeds forming, the calyxes are swollen.
[29:01.360 --> 29:02.920]  You know, there's seeds in there.
[29:02.920 --> 29:05.120]  Turn the timer back to 18 six.
[29:05.120 --> 29:11.480]  The plants will begin to revege in about 15 days, 17 days, you'll see revegetative growth
[29:11.480 --> 29:13.240]  happening on the plants.
[29:13.240 --> 29:14.240]  You'll be alarmed.
[29:14.240 --> 29:15.320]  We don't care about the buds.
[29:15.320 --> 29:18.520]  We care about the seeds tucked inside of those buds.
[29:18.520 --> 29:24.480]  That extra light, those extra photons, that extra PPFD, that extra energy is going to
[29:24.480 --> 29:27.800]  make the seeds grow with more vigor, more quickly.
[29:27.800 --> 29:32.360]  They'll get harder, faster, and they'll be done sooner, and there'll be more healthy
[29:32.360 --> 29:33.360]  seeds.
[29:33.360 --> 29:34.360]  I know this from experience.
[29:34.360 --> 29:35.720]  This is how I speed up seeds.
[29:35.720 --> 29:40.720]  So I think you can speed them up by putting the timer back to 18 six.
[29:40.720 --> 29:41.860]  That is for seeded plants.
[29:41.860 --> 29:42.860]  You can do it.
[29:43.260 --> 29:46.660]  You can do it once you see the seeds are building up and getting kind of chunky.
[29:46.660 --> 29:47.700]  That's when it is safe to do it.
[29:47.700 --> 29:49.820]  Put them on 18 six, let them go.
[29:49.820 --> 29:53.780]  And then when you start seeing the seeds poking out of the calyxes on the tips of the buds,
[29:53.780 --> 29:55.860]  pull a couple of them off and give them a squeeze.
[29:55.860 --> 29:56.860]  How do they feel?
[29:56.860 --> 29:57.860]  Are they hollow?
[29:57.860 --> 29:58.860]  Do they crunch?
[29:58.860 --> 29:59.860]  When you squeeze them, does juice come out?
[29:59.860 --> 30:00.860]  Did that green thing come out?
[30:00.860 --> 30:02.580]  Did a little white embryo come out?
[30:02.580 --> 30:05.780]  See what's inside of that seed and you'll know when they are ripe.
[30:05.780 --> 30:07.620]  Sometimes you need to dig deeper into the buds.
[30:07.620 --> 30:10.300]  Sometimes the outer seeds aren't the best seeds.
[30:10.300 --> 30:12.180]  Sometimes those get roasted by the light.
[30:12.180 --> 30:14.220]  Sometimes you touched them or something, you killed them.
[30:14.220 --> 30:15.740]  Get a seed from the inside of the bud.
[30:15.740 --> 30:17.180]  See if it's nice and hard.
[30:17.180 --> 30:18.420]  That is when it is time to harvest.
[30:18.420 --> 30:23.580]  So you can change the light cycle back to 18 six at the end of the flowering period
[30:23.580 --> 30:29.020]  for your seeded crop to help them get chunkier and faster and harder at a quicker rate.
[30:29.020 --> 30:30.020]  All right.
[30:30.020 --> 30:31.440]  That is my breeding advice for you.
[30:31.440 --> 30:32.440]  That was a golden tip.
[30:32.440 --> 30:33.740]  I don't share that with a lot of people.
[30:33.740 --> 30:36.300]  So don't tell anybody that I told you.
[30:36.300 --> 30:38.140]  I want to thank you for the great message.
