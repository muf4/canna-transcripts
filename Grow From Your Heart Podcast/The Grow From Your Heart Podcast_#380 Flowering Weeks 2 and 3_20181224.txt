[00:00.000 --> 00:05.360]  Welcome to the show everybody, it's time for episode 380 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.360 --> 00:08.300]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:08.300 --> 00:12.400]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[00:12.400 --> 00:18.120]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:18.120 --> 00:21.760]  You know I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:21.760 --> 00:26.160]  Today I've been taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary.
[00:26.160 --> 00:33.520]  The label says 64.7% THC and a total of 76.4 total cannabinoids.
[00:33.520 --> 00:37.900]  I always love Stardog, it is one of my favorite strains to grow, it's one of my favorite strains
[00:37.900 --> 00:41.540]  to take photos of, it is always one of my favorite strains to smoke.
[00:41.540 --> 00:46.440]  I love the aroma, I love the flavor, and I always love that nice head buzz from the Stardog.
[00:46.440 --> 00:52.080]  So today I'm taking dabs of Stardog, I feel like that will make for a great podcast.
[00:52.080 --> 00:54.440]  This episode is going to be another grow lesson.
[00:54.440 --> 00:58.520]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[00:58.520 --> 01:02.480]  We started by setting a goal for our garden, we found the right place for our garden, we
[01:02.480 --> 01:04.920]  selected and purchased the appropriate equipment.
[01:04.920 --> 01:09.800]  At this point in the grow, we are past week one of flower and we are entering week two
[01:09.800 --> 01:11.680]  of the flowering phase.
[01:11.680 --> 01:15.720]  This episode will highlight weeks two and three or days eight through twenty one of
[01:15.720 --> 01:17.280]  the flowering phase.
[01:17.280 --> 01:20.520]  If you feel like you need a better foundation and you haven't been listening to the show,
[01:20.520 --> 01:24.600]  I recommend you head back to episode three fifty one and start on the grow lessons in
[01:24.600 --> 01:26.460]  episode three fifty one.
[01:26.460 --> 01:29.940]  If you've been following along and you feel like you're up to speed, let's jump right
[01:29.940 --> 01:31.720]  into a grow lesson.
[01:31.720 --> 01:35.840]  In this episode, we're going to focus on weeks two and three of the flowering phase, also
[01:35.840 --> 01:38.160]  known as days eight through twenty one.
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.120]  Before we get there, let's recap a little bit of the previous episode.
[01:42.120 --> 01:46.480]  In the last episode, we changed our timer to twelve hours on and twelve hours off to
[01:46.480 --> 01:47.960]  initiate flower.
[01:47.960 --> 01:51.620]  We are now seven days into the flowering phase.
[01:51.620 --> 01:55.440]  Hopefully at this point you have not over fertilized or ran into any pH issues with
[01:55.440 --> 01:56.760]  your garden.
[01:56.760 --> 02:00.560]  Hopefully at this point you have not interrupted the dark cycle at all.
[02:00.560 --> 02:04.120]  Interrupting that dark cycle will disrupt the flowering phase and throw your plants
[02:04.120 --> 02:08.080]  into shock and possibly cause hermaphrodites.
[02:08.080 --> 02:11.440]  Hopefully the garden has remained pest and pathogen free.
[02:11.440 --> 02:17.040]  So if everything is on the right track, let's move in to week two or day eight of the flowering
[02:17.120 --> 02:18.520]  phase.
[02:18.520 --> 02:22.840]  At this stage of the flowering process, we're not going to notice much change from the vegetative
[02:22.840 --> 02:23.840]  cycle.
[02:23.840 --> 02:25.200]  You may notice a little bit of stretch.
[02:25.200 --> 02:28.740]  The plants may have taken off and they're starting to get a little bit taller on you.
[02:28.740 --> 02:31.320]  Some of your plants may be showing pre-flower.
[02:31.320 --> 02:34.980]  Some of your plants may start indicating sex around this time.
[02:34.980 --> 02:37.000]  Don't stress if they are not showing you sex yet.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.120]  We still have plenty of time.
[02:39.120 --> 02:41.880]  But the main thing you're going to see at this point is stretch.
[02:41.880 --> 02:44.200]  Those plants are starting to grow taller.
[02:44.200 --> 02:45.200]  That is okay.
[02:45.200 --> 02:46.560]  That is exactly what we're expecting.
[02:46.560 --> 02:50.720]  For the first three weeks, we're going to see a lot of stretching happening to these
[02:50.720 --> 02:51.720]  plants.
[02:51.720 --> 02:55.920]  Now we will probably start seeing pre-flower and bud set starting to develop around day
[02:55.920 --> 02:57.240]  10 or 12.
[02:57.240 --> 03:02.280]  We will definitely have little dandelion looking bud sets popping up around day 14.
[03:02.280 --> 03:06.000]  So things are about to start getting very exciting in our garden.
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.520]  Now let's talk about the environment and conditions in our grow room during weeks two and three
[03:10.520 --> 03:12.720]  of the flowering phase.
[03:12.720 --> 03:18.280]  At this stage of flowering, during the day, I try to aim between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit
[03:18.280 --> 03:20.040]  for my daytime temperature.
[03:20.040 --> 03:25.600]  I also aim for 40 to 50% relative humidity for my daytime temperature.
[03:25.600 --> 03:28.160]  Now let's talk about nighttime temperatures.
[03:28.160 --> 03:32.720]  In the nighttime, I like to have my temperature between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
[03:32.720 --> 03:39.440]  I also aim for 40 to 50% humidity during my nighttime cycle at this stage of flowering.
[03:39.440 --> 03:44.400]  Now I want to remind you, try not to have more than a 10 degree temperature difference
[03:44.400 --> 03:46.480]  in your day and nighttime cycle.
[03:46.480 --> 03:49.440]  That is called your diurnal temperature variation.
[03:49.440 --> 03:52.360]  Try to keep that less than 10 degrees.
[03:52.360 --> 03:56.300]  Too much of a drastic swing from day to night temperature will start causing your plants
[03:56.300 --> 03:57.300]  to grow slowly.
[03:57.300 --> 03:58.300]  They will get stagnant.
[03:58.300 --> 03:59.300]  They will slow down.
[03:59.300 --> 04:00.560]  They will not be happy.
[04:00.560 --> 04:03.640]  Also, this will encourage powdery mildew.
[04:03.640 --> 04:08.900]  So let's aim to keep that temperature within 10 degrees from the day and night cycles.
[04:08.900 --> 04:12.420]  Something we should add into our flower room that I've been overlooking on previous episodes
[04:12.420 --> 04:14.060]  is more fans.
[04:14.060 --> 04:15.260]  We need more airflow.
[04:15.260 --> 04:20.000]  As we are entering the flowering stage, we are going to develop big, fat, chunky buds.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.820]  We need more airflow once we have those buds in the room.
[04:23.820 --> 04:25.220]  We're going to have a lot of moisture.
[04:25.220 --> 04:27.360]  We're going to have big, fat, chunky buds.
[04:27.360 --> 04:30.420]  Those buds will act like a sponge if there is too much moisture.
[04:30.420 --> 04:34.040]  So we need to blow some air around the room and keep that moisture moving.
[04:34.040 --> 04:37.100]  I feel like a little bit of wind and airflow is really good for the plants.
[04:37.100 --> 04:38.100]  It makes them active.
[04:38.100 --> 04:41.620]  I feel like some wind and a little bit of pressure makes the stalks more robust.
[04:41.620 --> 04:44.700]  It makes them want to stand up on their own a little better.
[04:44.700 --> 04:46.300]  Imagine if I shoved you a little bit.
[04:46.300 --> 04:48.220]  You would spread your feet for a little more balance.
[04:48.220 --> 04:51.380]  I think a little bit of wind makes the plants want to spread their feet for a little bit
[04:51.380 --> 04:52.780]  more balance.
[04:52.780 --> 04:55.460]  So add a little bit of wind and airflow to the garden.
[04:55.460 --> 04:56.460]  Don't go crazy.
[04:56.460 --> 04:57.660]  We don't need a wind tunnel in there.
[04:57.660 --> 04:59.380]  We're not trying to dry out the plants.
[04:59.380 --> 05:01.540]  We just want the air moving.
[05:01.540 --> 05:05.540]  If some of your leaves start looking dry and leathery and kind of potato chip-like, they're
[05:05.540 --> 05:08.100]  probably getting beat up by that fan too much.
[05:08.100 --> 05:11.020]  You were ruining the VPD around those leaves.
[05:11.020 --> 05:13.880]  In that condition, just reduce the wind just a little bit.
[05:13.880 --> 05:17.500]  But it's never a bad idea to have some airflow in your grow.
[05:17.500 --> 05:22.300]  If you notice your grow room is consistently too humid, it may be time to invest in a dehumidifier
[05:22.300 --> 05:28.140]  or maybe a larger dehumidifier or possibly add some sort of extraction fan to remove
[05:28.140 --> 05:31.260]  that humid air from the room and replace it with fresh air.
[05:31.260 --> 05:35.480]  If you do add an extraction fan, keep in mind that as the air gets sucked out of the room
[05:35.620 --> 05:39.780]  it is also going to try to draw air into the room through every open opportunity.
[05:39.780 --> 05:42.900]  Most of the time you're going to get air pulled into the room underneath the door.
[05:42.900 --> 05:45.880]  Most of us don't seal the bottom of the door well enough.
[05:45.880 --> 05:50.100]  I feel like that is a great place for fresh air to come in as long as the air coming in
[05:50.100 --> 05:51.280]  is clean.
[05:51.280 --> 05:54.800]  If that air is coming from within your house, it is probably safe.
[05:54.800 --> 05:59.600]  If that crack leads to outside, I would cover that up and find a safer source for the air.
[05:59.600 --> 06:01.280]  That's just going to bring in bugs.
[06:01.280 --> 06:03.440]  It's going to bring in whatever is by that door.
[06:03.440 --> 06:07.680]  If it's powdery mildew, if it's just dirt and dust, it's going to suck all of that right
[06:07.680 --> 06:10.000]  under the door into your grow room.
[06:10.000 --> 06:13.800]  So as soon as you cut a hole for an extraction fan, start thinking about where the air is
[06:13.800 --> 06:17.040]  going to come in when you start blowing that air out.
[06:17.040 --> 06:22.000]  If you cut a hole in a wall and add an extraction fan and blow that air out of the room, it
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.480]  may create a whistling noise underneath the door from all the air flowing underneath that
[06:27.480 --> 06:28.480]  door.
[06:28.480 --> 06:32.880]  If that air creates a big whistling noise, you may need to add a passive hole for air
[06:32.880 --> 06:34.760]  to go into the room.
[06:34.760 --> 06:37.920]  This just depends on the size of the extraction fan that you set up.
[06:37.920 --> 06:41.920]  If you put a little four-inch extraction fan, you'll definitely pull enough air under the
[06:41.920 --> 06:42.920]  door.
[06:42.920 --> 06:44.200]  You don't need to make any passive holes.
[06:44.200 --> 06:47.800]  If you go setting up an eight-inch vortex fan in there and you're just blowing air out
[06:47.800 --> 06:51.800]  of that room, first of all, I recommend a carbon filter on that extraction fan that's
[06:51.800 --> 06:52.800]  going out.
[06:52.800 --> 06:53.800]  You need to filter that air.
[06:53.800 --> 06:59.280]  But also, you may need to make about a four-inch hole to allow air to get into that room somehow.
[06:59.280 --> 07:01.180]  You are sucking all of the air out.
[07:01.180 --> 07:03.560]  You need to allow fresh air in.
[07:03.560 --> 07:07.780]  Cutting holes in walls and adding extraction fans can lead to a lot of problems.
[07:07.780 --> 07:11.000]  Think about this very carefully before you go this route.
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.900]  Also, if you're using CO2, you may want to think about this option because then you're
[07:14.900 --> 07:18.420]  going to fill the room with CO2 and then you're just going to use that exhaust fan to suck
[07:18.420 --> 07:20.040]  the CO2 right out of the room.
[07:20.040 --> 07:24.000]  You're just blowing your expensive gas right out the window, literally.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.800]  I've opened up the conversation for negative pressure versus positive pressure in a grow
[07:28.800 --> 07:32.500]  room environment, but I feel like that is a lesson for the future.
[07:32.500 --> 07:36.160]  I will write a note and we will talk about that in a future episode.
[07:36.160 --> 07:39.600]  Let's get a little bit more on track with this grow lesson and focus.
[07:39.600 --> 07:43.800]  Let's talk a little bit about the nutrients we may need at this phase of the flowering
[07:43.800 --> 07:45.320]  cycle.
[07:45.320 --> 07:49.840]  During this part of flowering, we are mainly focusing on a smooth transition from the vegetative
[07:49.840 --> 07:52.160]  stage to the flowering phase.
[07:52.160 --> 07:56.560]  At this point in flowering, we are mainly focusing on a smooth transition from the veg
[07:56.560 --> 08:00.440]  stage to the flowering stage of our plant cycle.
[08:00.440 --> 08:03.200]  Week 2 is very similar to week 1.
[08:03.200 --> 08:05.960]  We will mainly focus on our NPK.
[08:05.960 --> 08:11.000]  We need a low nitrogen, high phosphorus, high potassium diet at this stage.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.760]  I said earlier, abandon the veg bottle and start using the bloom bottle.
[08:15.760 --> 08:18.360]  Also, we need cow mag at this stage.
[08:18.360 --> 08:21.520]  We also need potassium silicates in my opinion.
[08:21.520 --> 08:23.880]  I also like to add a mycoproduct.
[08:23.880 --> 08:27.360]  Some sort of root product is always good at this stage.
[08:27.360 --> 08:31.780]  Also, enzymes and carbs are great for week 2.
[08:31.780 --> 08:36.320]  As we work toward week 3, I like to increase my carbohydrates.
[08:36.320 --> 08:38.560]  The plants are getting bud set at this point.
[08:38.560 --> 08:40.240]  They're going to start taking off.
[08:40.240 --> 08:44.440]  I like having some sugars in there to feed the microbes, and then I like having the carbs
[08:44.440 --> 08:49.400]  and the sugars in there to give the plants energy that will encourage rapid growth.
[08:49.400 --> 08:54.560]  At the beginning of week 3, I will start increasing my carbohydrate feeding just a little bit,
[08:54.560 --> 08:58.520]  and I will slowly increase that through the flowering phase.
[08:58.520 --> 09:00.400]  We don't need to add a bloom booster yet.
[09:00.400 --> 09:02.160]  We are not quite there yet.
[09:02.160 --> 09:07.200]  Let's just focus on getting these plants through the stretch phase and get the bud sites developed.
[09:07.200 --> 09:12.280]  Then when we work on the next lesson, we will start adding bloom boosters.
[09:12.280 --> 09:16.120]  Now we are rapidly running out of time for pesticide applications.
[09:16.120 --> 09:21.360]  We need to do a very thorough pest scouting and see what we've got in the grow.
[09:21.360 --> 09:22.360]  We may have thrips.
[09:22.360 --> 09:23.440]  We may have spider mites.
[09:23.440 --> 09:24.600]  We could have fungus gnats.
[09:24.600 --> 09:26.120]  We could have white flies.
[09:26.120 --> 09:30.000]  There could be a myriad of problems popping up at this point in the grow.
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.320]  Let's do an inspection and find out what we're dealing with.
[09:33.320 --> 09:39.320]  If you find any pests, now is one of your last times to apply a sprayed pesticide.
[09:39.360 --> 09:42.840]  I don't like to spray anything after day 14.
[09:42.840 --> 09:48.000]  If you've got an obvious problem, we may extend that just a few days with very specific products,
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.360]  but I really don't like to spray anything past day 14.
[09:52.360 --> 09:54.000]  So let's do a quick scouting.
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.200]  Let's identify any problems we may have and let's spray before day 14 approaches.
[09:59.200 --> 10:05.040]  At this point, we're at day 8, so we can get 2 or 3 solid pesticide spray applications
[10:05.040 --> 10:07.220]  in if they are required.
[10:07.220 --> 10:13.220]  If you don't identify any pests, I may still suggest a preventative spray around day 14
[10:13.220 --> 10:15.820]  just to make sure nothing pops up.
[10:15.820 --> 10:20.740]  Now is the time to get in there and identify pests and work really hard at getting rid
[10:20.740 --> 10:26.740]  of them before we move deeper into the flowering phase and we really limit ourselves on pesticide
[10:26.740 --> 10:28.360]  applications.
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.300]  This is also a good time to start ordering your predator bugs if you're going to use
[10:32.300 --> 10:35.480]  biologicals as your pesticide treatment.
[10:35.480 --> 10:40.780]  If you plan on using biologicals, think about your spray applications and use a strategy
[10:40.780 --> 10:44.880]  that will not cause harm to your beneficials when they do arrive.
[10:44.880 --> 10:50.120]  There are pesticides that you can apply to your plants today and you can release beneficial
[10:50.120 --> 10:52.920]  insects tomorrow and they will work together.
[10:52.920 --> 10:56.560]  If you apply the proper pesticide, you will not kill your beneficials.
[10:56.560 --> 11:01.800]  You will have to do some research on the pesticide and the beneficials and see if they get along.
[11:01.800 --> 11:04.200]  Some of the pesticides are based on pyrethrum.
[11:04.200 --> 11:06.400]  Some of them are based on neem.
[11:06.400 --> 11:09.320]  Some of them are beneficial fungus and bacteria.
[11:09.320 --> 11:14.400]  Those beneficial fungus and bacteria may not kill or disrupt your predator bugs, but it
[11:14.400 --> 11:18.880]  will make the environment uncomfortable for the spider mites because they intend to eat
[11:18.880 --> 11:20.000]  those leaves.
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.200]  The predators are going to eat the spider mites, not the leaves, so they may be able
[11:24.200 --> 11:26.880]  to survive with certain pesticides.
[11:26.880 --> 11:30.900]  It's your responsibility as the grower to do the research on the pesticide you're going
[11:30.900 --> 11:36.420]  to apply and also do research on the predator bugs which you plan to use in your integrated
[11:36.420 --> 11:41.400]  pest management strategy and find out if they can work together.
[11:41.400 --> 11:47.020]  Some of the newer pesticide and fungicide products actually advertise safe for beneficials
[11:47.020 --> 11:49.480]  or will not harm beneficials.
[11:49.480 --> 11:54.020]  That is saying that they recommend that product in a garden that is also using beneficial
[11:54.020 --> 11:56.820]  insects as a form of pest management.
[11:56.820 --> 11:58.560]  So let's get on top of pest management.
[11:58.560 --> 12:02.360]  Let's do some scouting and if you see anything, now is the time to work on getting rid of
[12:02.360 --> 12:04.640]  that before we get deeper into flower.
[12:04.640 --> 12:08.880]  Now while you're scouting for pests, that is a great time to keep an eye out for male
[12:08.880 --> 12:09.880]  plants.
[12:09.880 --> 12:13.640]  If you are growing from seed, you've got the opportunity to find males in your garden.
[12:13.640 --> 12:17.740]  You have also got the opportunity to find hermaphrodites in the garden and you may also
[12:17.740 --> 12:21.240]  find some mutants in your flowering room.
[12:21.240 --> 12:24.240]  The male plants are going to start popping up around day 10.
[12:24.520 --> 12:28.680]  They usually open up and start dropping pollen right around day 14.
[12:28.680 --> 12:32.560]  So we've got a very small window of time to discover these males and get them out of the
[12:32.560 --> 12:35.600]  room before they cause problems.
[12:35.600 --> 12:38.520]  Don't be lazy when it comes to pulling males out of your garden.
[12:38.520 --> 12:42.080]  If you've got a small garden, if you've got a large garden, you need to look at every
[12:42.080 --> 12:46.120]  single plant and pull every single male out of that grow.
[12:46.120 --> 12:49.840]  You also need to pay very close attention for hermaphrodites.
[12:49.840 --> 12:55.320]  When you're checking for males and hermaphrodites on new plants, check in several spots on each
[12:55.320 --> 12:56.320]  plant.
[12:56.320 --> 12:58.480]  The top may not reveal hermaphrodite traits.
[12:58.480 --> 13:03.120]  Down lower where you're not getting a lot of light penetration, those plants may show
[13:03.120 --> 13:04.280]  intersex traits.
[13:04.280 --> 13:08.680]  You may get male flowers popping up in your female buds lower on the plant.
[13:08.680 --> 13:11.320]  Pay close attention to the entire plant.
[13:11.320 --> 13:15.120]  I feel like I gave a pretty good description of what a male plant looks like and what a
[13:15.120 --> 13:20.760]  female plant looks like on a previous podcast, but I do encourage you to Google male and
[13:20.760 --> 13:25.600]  female cannabis plants and see what they look like before the time comes.
[13:25.600 --> 13:29.520]  That way when you've got a boy in the garden, you are sure and you've got confidence and
[13:29.520 --> 13:34.080]  you can remove that male plant from your garden confidently and know you are not going to
[13:34.080 --> 13:35.760]  cause any problems.
[13:35.760 --> 13:39.560]  You want to find the boys before the pollen sacks start opening.
[13:39.560 --> 13:42.960]  Let's talk about what happens if you find a boy and one of those sacks is starting to
[13:42.960 --> 13:43.960]  open.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.760]  The first thing I would do is spray it with water.
[13:46.760 --> 13:48.520]  Water deactivates pollen.
[13:48.520 --> 13:49.960]  Spray that pollen with water.
[13:49.960 --> 13:51.200]  You'll shut it down.
[13:51.200 --> 13:53.360]  Also, spray the girls with water.
[13:53.360 --> 13:56.840]  If you've got clean water around, just spray some water on the plants.
[13:56.840 --> 13:59.320]  Yes, I said we don't want to spray plants that are in flower.
[13:59.320 --> 14:03.360]  I'd rather get them a little bit wet at this point than I would rather get pollen on them.
[14:03.360 --> 14:04.600]  Also, this is just water.
[14:04.600 --> 14:06.000]  There's no pesticide in here.
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.480]  The plants would get hit with rain.
[14:07.480 --> 14:08.680]  It would get hit with dew.
[14:08.680 --> 14:10.480]  This is going to be just fine.
[14:10.480 --> 14:11.480]  Spray them with some water.
[14:11.480 --> 14:12.600]  That will deactivate the pollen.
[14:12.920 --> 14:16.000]  It will also make the plants unable to receive the pollen.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.680]  At that point, you can either cut down that male plant or you can slide a trash bag right
[14:20.680 --> 14:22.120]  over it like a condom.
[14:22.120 --> 14:23.120]  Then cut it.
[14:23.120 --> 14:24.120]  Then get it out of the room.
[14:24.120 --> 14:26.440]  Just try not to spread that pollen.
[14:26.440 --> 14:29.840]  I know we've sprayed it with water, but as you bump it around, it's going to open up.
[14:29.840 --> 14:31.200]  More pollen's going to come out.
[14:31.200 --> 14:33.120]  Do your best not to spread that stuff.
[14:33.120 --> 14:34.320]  Hit it with water.
[14:34.320 --> 14:35.760]  Put the trash bag over it.
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.160]  Either take the whole plant, including the dirt, out of the grow or cut it at the base
[14:40.320 --> 14:44.120]  and just get that plant out of there as soon as possible.
[14:44.120 --> 14:48.720]  Leaving a male plant in the grow room for too long will result in a seeded crop.
[14:48.720 --> 14:51.160]  Most of us are aiming for a seedless crop.
[14:51.160 --> 14:54.280]  If you are growing a crop for a commercial reason and you're trying to put it out on
[14:54.280 --> 14:59.760]  the black market, a couple of seeds will ruin the value of your entire crop.
[14:59.760 --> 15:00.760]  So don't be lazy.
[15:00.760 --> 15:02.080]  Keep your eye out for males.
[15:02.080 --> 15:04.600]  Know what males look like and get them out of the garden.
[15:04.600 --> 15:08.800]  Also, keep an eye out for hermaphrodites and get them out of the garden.
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.320]  Once we are past weeks 2 and 3, you cannot get lazy if you're growing from seed.
[15:13.320 --> 15:17.280]  Just because they look like females, you've still got the opportunity for a hermaphrodite
[15:17.280 --> 15:20.600]  to pop up all the way through the flowering cycle.
[15:20.600 --> 15:23.040]  It may not show itself until week 9.
[15:23.040 --> 15:24.960]  It may not show itself until week 10.
[15:24.960 --> 15:27.920]  But you need to see it if it does happen.
[15:27.920 --> 15:31.720]  I've said earlier, if it pops up late in flower, it may not be a big deal.
[15:31.720 --> 15:33.920]  It is too late for the plants to receive pollen.
[15:33.920 --> 15:36.160]  It won't make any seeds that late into flower.
[15:36.160 --> 15:41.840]  Most of the time, if they throw a male flower past week 7 or 8, they're usually sterile
[15:41.840 --> 15:44.280]  male flowers that will not contain any pollen.
[15:44.280 --> 15:46.400]  So there's not much to worry about.
[15:46.400 --> 15:51.800]  But if you're getting hermaphrodites early in flower, they must be removed from the garden.
[15:51.800 --> 15:54.100]  All right, we've got our environment dialed in.
[15:54.100 --> 15:55.720]  We know what to feed our plants.
[15:55.720 --> 15:57.000]  We are scouting for pests.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.880]  We have applied our final pesticide application.
[15:59.880 --> 16:02.200]  We have considered releasing predator mites.
[16:02.200 --> 16:04.660]  We know how to look for males and hermaphrodites.
[16:04.660 --> 16:06.380]  We are on the look for trouble.
[16:06.380 --> 16:07.380]  We're looking for bugs.
[16:07.380 --> 16:08.380]  We're looking for males.
[16:08.380 --> 16:09.740]  We're looking for herms.
[16:09.740 --> 16:14.880]  Now let's talk about a few things we can do to improve the quality of our garden this
[16:14.880 --> 16:17.220]  early in the flowering phase.
[16:17.220 --> 16:21.820]  If you're running a trellis or a scrognet, now is a good time to continue working those
[16:21.820 --> 16:23.140]  buds into the net.
[16:23.140 --> 16:25.540]  You can still work those branches into the net.
[16:25.540 --> 16:28.840]  I would stop doing it probably toward the end of week 3.
[16:28.840 --> 16:30.020]  But you've still got time.
[16:30.020 --> 16:33.860]  If you've got a branch that's popping up too high, feel free to give it a little crack.
[16:33.860 --> 16:36.460]  Send it down under the net and work it into the canopy.
[16:36.460 --> 16:40.540]  We can keep working on a nice even canopy all the way through the end of week 3.
[16:40.540 --> 16:42.080]  So let's keep popping them.
[16:42.080 --> 16:44.940]  Let's keep twisting them and working them into the canopy.
[16:44.940 --> 16:47.580]  Let's talk a little bit about popping and twisting.
[16:47.580 --> 16:50.420]  I've talked a lot about popping and twisting in the beginning of flower.
[16:50.420 --> 16:54.620]  I continue to do this all the way through weeks 4 and 5.
[16:54.620 --> 16:57.580]  I will pop every stem right at the beginning of flower.
[16:57.580 --> 17:00.740]  Give it about 2 weeks to heal up and go back and do it again.
[17:00.740 --> 17:04.140]  Give it about 2 weeks to heal up and go back and do it again.
[17:04.140 --> 17:09.060]  So grab the base of the stalk, grab it with your other hand and twist your top hand.
[17:09.060 --> 17:11.100]  And as you twist, you'll hear a little pop.
[17:11.100 --> 17:13.020]  That's exactly what you're looking for.
[17:13.020 --> 17:15.340]  As that heals, it will create a knuckle.
[17:15.340 --> 17:17.820]  That knuckle will make a strong spot in the plant.
[17:17.820 --> 17:21.120]  I like to do that to where the entire plant is covered in knuckles.
[17:21.120 --> 17:24.900]  It looks really knurled and I feel like that that plant is very productive.
[17:24.900 --> 17:27.740]  It's got a nice thick stalk that can hold a lot of weight.
[17:27.740 --> 17:29.220]  It can hold fat buds.
[17:29.220 --> 17:34.180]  It's also got nice thick stalks that can move a lot of water, which can carry a lot of nutrients.
[17:34.180 --> 17:39.120]  So I feel like it is a very beneficial thing to crack all of the stems.
[17:39.120 --> 17:42.900]  So continue working your plants into the trellis if you're using a trellis.
[17:42.900 --> 17:46.340]  Continue cracking and popping the sticks to make robust plants.
[17:46.340 --> 17:48.940]  I also like to do a bit of lollipopping.
[17:48.940 --> 17:53.300]  If you've got some crappy branches on the bottom of the plant, feel free to remove them.
[17:53.300 --> 17:56.980]  If you've got branches that come off the very bottom of the plant and reach up toward the
[17:56.980 --> 18:02.540]  top, and those top branches, the tops have potential to create good usable buds, you
[18:02.540 --> 18:07.500]  can clean up the bottom suckers off of that long branch and keep that arm and grow a bud
[18:07.500 --> 18:12.060]  at the end of the arm and take off all that little crap at the bottom of it that you don't need.
[18:12.060 --> 18:17.420]  It is very common to see plants that are three and four feet tall that are completely naked
[18:17.420 --> 18:19.700]  for the first 18 inches of the very bottom.
[18:19.700 --> 18:21.900]  It's just a bunch of sticks coming out of the pot.
[18:21.900 --> 18:23.100]  You don't have any foliage.
[18:23.100 --> 18:24.300]  You don't have any little branches.
[18:24.300 --> 18:26.140]  You don't have any tiny bud sites.
[18:26.140 --> 18:30.300]  They're over 18 inches to maybe even two feet off the ground, depending on the grower's
[18:30.300 --> 18:34.180]  environment and the grower's style and what type of lights they are using.
[18:34.180 --> 18:38.460]  So feel free to get in there and cut out any shitty branches that aren't going to be productive,
[18:38.460 --> 18:42.260]  and feel free to clean up all that stuff real down low on the plant that's not going to
[18:42.260 --> 18:44.100]  get any light.
[18:44.100 --> 18:48.140]  When harvest time comes, we're going to have to trim everything we cut down.
[18:48.140 --> 18:51.980]  If you cut all that little fluffy crap off the plant, you don't have to trim it.
[18:51.980 --> 18:54.900]  Now you're saying, yeah, I could have used that for concentrates or something.
[18:54.900 --> 18:55.900]  Right.
[18:56.660 --> 18:58.660]  If we cut all that crap off the bottom, we can move that energy right up to the top of
[18:58.660 --> 18:59.660]  the plant.
[18:59.660 --> 19:04.300]  Instead of growing that crappy little fluff at the bottom, we just basically moved that
[19:04.300 --> 19:09.700]  up to that top cola to make all those top buds just that much heavier, that much fatter,
[19:09.700 --> 19:11.360]  that much more density.
[19:11.360 --> 19:15.100]  So clean up any crap on the bottom that may be slowing your plants down and move that
[19:15.100 --> 19:17.100]  energy right up to the top.
[19:17.100 --> 19:21.500]  Now another thing I find advantageous is defoliation.
[19:21.500 --> 19:26.780]  There's a lot of debate in the cannabis industry about how to defoliate, what level to defoliate,
[19:26.780 --> 19:28.380]  and when to defoliate.
[19:28.380 --> 19:32.380]  I like to do kind of a hard defoliation right at the start of flower.
[19:32.380 --> 19:37.260]  If there is a large leaf shadowing another branch or shadowing another bud site, I will
[19:37.260 --> 19:39.540]  remove that leaf without question.
[19:39.540 --> 19:44.260]  Then I'll go through the grow and anything with a purple petiole gets removed at the
[19:44.260 --> 19:46.060]  very start of flower.
[19:46.060 --> 19:50.060]  I do this in a commercial environment for several reasons.
[19:50.060 --> 19:53.340]  Removing all of those extra leaves removes opportunity.
[19:53.340 --> 19:57.780]  There are less places for pests to hide and there are less places for pathogens to hang
[19:57.780 --> 19:58.780]  out.
[19:58.780 --> 20:00.420]  So remove the opportunities.
[20:00.420 --> 20:03.580]  Also it reduces humidity in the room.
[20:03.580 --> 20:08.280]  Without as many leaves doing as much transpiration and respiration, there's a little bit less
[20:08.280 --> 20:12.940]  moisture in the room so it makes it easier to balance the humidity in the room.
[20:12.940 --> 20:19.860]  I also think a well-timed, well-executed defoliation will increase the vigor of our plants.
[20:19.860 --> 20:23.060]  A lot of people will say you don't want to pull off the leaves because that's where the
[20:23.060 --> 20:27.620]  sugars are stored and they're going to use that for nutrients and energy, but we are
[20:27.620 --> 20:29.580]  feeding the shit out of these plants.
[20:29.580 --> 20:31.580]  They don't need to use anything that is stored.
[20:31.580 --> 20:35.780]  We are pouring expensive nutrients into these plants on a daily basis.
[20:35.780 --> 20:38.860]  Don't worry about the stuff stored in those leaves.
[20:38.860 --> 20:41.580]  We're going to replace that right away.
[20:41.580 --> 20:45.700]  Another argument to the defoliation is that those leaves are used as solar panels and
[20:45.700 --> 20:46.900]  they need to be there.
[20:46.940 --> 20:51.700]  Yes, they do, but there is a point where sometimes a leaf is blocking a bud site where if you
[20:51.700 --> 20:56.460]  remove that leaf, it would be more beneficial to put the light closer to the bud than on
[20:56.460 --> 21:00.540]  that big ole solar leaf, so selectively remove your leaves.
[21:00.540 --> 21:05.100]  If you're new at defoliating, go in and just tear off a few leaves and see how the plants
[21:05.100 --> 21:06.100]  react.
[21:06.100 --> 21:09.940]  Then the next time, take off a few more and see how the plants react.
[21:09.940 --> 21:12.860]  This will be very strain dependent.
[21:12.860 --> 21:19.380]  Sativa leaning strains won't react as well as indica leaning strains will react to heavy
[21:19.380 --> 21:20.380]  defoliation.
[21:20.380 --> 21:24.900]  Another thing I'll recommend is leave those two leaves at the top of the bud.
[21:24.900 --> 21:28.900]  You'll have one bud, your main top sticking up, then at the top of that, there are two
[21:28.900 --> 21:30.500]  leaves sticking out.
[21:30.500 --> 21:33.660]  When you look in the grow room, you'll see the two leaves I'm talking about.
[21:33.660 --> 21:36.420]  I like to leave those on every plant.
[21:36.420 --> 21:40.100]  Those two mains that are sticking out of the top of the main bud, I like to leave those
[21:40.100 --> 21:41.940]  until late in flower.
[21:42.020 --> 21:47.380]  But quite often, those will be the only large leaves I leave on every plant.
[21:47.380 --> 21:51.580]  So I recommend a semi-heavy defoliation here at the beginning of flower.
[21:51.580 --> 21:57.140]  Then we'll do it again around week four and we'll do it again around week six.
[21:57.140 --> 22:02.300]  Defoliating and cracking and twisting and working into trellis work is kind of an art.
[22:02.300 --> 22:06.860]  You will have to get good at this over time, which will require confidence.
[22:06.860 --> 22:08.580]  So don't be scared.
[22:08.580 --> 22:10.640]  Just get in there and learn how to do it.
[22:10.640 --> 22:12.520]  You are going to make mistakes.
[22:12.520 --> 22:16.160]  I have made countless mistakes in my own grow.
[22:16.160 --> 22:18.320]  I've made mistakes in commercial grows.
[22:18.320 --> 22:21.080]  I have made tiny mistakes and I have made huge mistakes.
[22:21.080 --> 22:22.080]  But you know what?
[22:22.080 --> 22:25.360]  That's how I became a good grower.
[22:25.360 --> 22:27.240]  Experience includes mistakes.
[22:27.240 --> 22:29.760]  Don't be afraid to make mistakes.
[22:29.760 --> 22:32.800]  This is not the last crop you are going to grow.
[22:32.800 --> 22:34.280]  This is a practice crop.
[22:34.280 --> 22:36.760]  The next one will be your pro crop.
[22:36.760 --> 22:40.560]  Don't act like these plants are the last plants you're ever going to get to touch.
[22:40.560 --> 22:42.000]  This is your first time.
[22:42.000 --> 22:43.600]  This is your second time.
[22:43.600 --> 22:44.920]  Have some confidence.
[22:44.920 --> 22:46.080]  Build some confidence.
[22:46.080 --> 22:49.460]  Let's just get in there and break some shit and ruin some shit so that you can see what
[22:49.460 --> 22:50.460]  can go wrong.
[22:50.460 --> 22:52.800]  Then the next grow will be really easy.
[22:52.800 --> 22:54.880]  So don't be afraid to wreck some shit.
[22:54.880 --> 22:56.820]  Don't be afraid to cause some problems.
[22:56.820 --> 22:58.800]  That's how you learn things.
[22:58.800 --> 23:03.020]  If every grow goes smoothly for you, you're going to think growing is easy and you're
[23:03.020 --> 23:05.080]  not going to learn anything.
[23:05.080 --> 23:08.180]  Then your ego is going to get in the way and that's when you're really going to run into
[23:08.180 --> 23:11.660]  problems and then you will have no idea how to solve them.
[23:11.660 --> 23:13.660]  So my point is, don't be scared.
[23:13.660 --> 23:15.160]  Just get in there and play with the plants.
[23:15.160 --> 23:16.160]  You may kill one.
[23:16.160 --> 23:17.220]  You may kill two.
[23:17.220 --> 23:19.320]  But you will learn what they can take.
[23:19.320 --> 23:22.640]  These plants are way more resilient than you would imagine.
[23:22.640 --> 23:26.360]  If this is your first grow, if this is your second grow, you're probably touching those
[23:26.360 --> 23:29.220]  plants like they're delicate little babies.
[23:29.220 --> 23:33.620]  When you see me in a commercial environment, you're going to think I am an abusive ogre
[23:33.620 --> 23:34.940]  to these plants.
[23:34.940 --> 23:39.100]  But then at the end, you will see the highest quality, most beautiful buds come out of these
[23:39.100 --> 23:42.120]  plants that I kind of beat up through their whole life.
[23:42.120 --> 23:43.660]  I really care for the plants.
[23:43.660 --> 23:46.280]  I really have a passion for the garden.
[23:46.280 --> 23:49.740]  Sometimes I'm going really fast and I don't have time for bullshit and I need to get a
[23:49.740 --> 23:52.580]  lot of stuff done in a small amount of time.
[23:52.580 --> 23:56.500]  And sometimes I get a little rough and sometimes it looks like I'm being aggressive.
[23:56.500 --> 23:57.500]  And I am.
[23:57.500 --> 24:01.940]  But at the end of the day, the plants show me that they were satisfied with what I did.
[24:01.940 --> 24:04.620]  These plants are used to being outside, growing on a hill.
[24:04.620 --> 24:08.780]  These plants are used to being stuck in one place and can't walk away when shit gets weird.
[24:08.780 --> 24:09.820]  They've been in the wind.
[24:09.820 --> 24:10.820]  They've been in the rain.
[24:10.820 --> 24:12.420]  They've been beat up by nature.
[24:12.420 --> 24:14.780]  Some of them probably got peed on by a goat.
[24:14.780 --> 24:19.360]  Cannabis plants are amazingly resilient plants and they can take some abuse.
[24:19.360 --> 24:20.500]  So let's abuse them.
[24:20.500 --> 24:22.460]  Let's beat them up a little bit and see what they can take.
[24:22.460 --> 24:26.180]  Because I think when we push them to their limits, that's when we see their full potential.
[24:26.180 --> 24:28.900]  So don't be afraid to get in there and break some shit, you guys.
[24:28.900 --> 24:31.300]  This is not going to be your last crop.
[24:31.300 --> 24:36.540]  I understand that seeds and clones are very expensive and that this crop means a lot to you.
[24:36.540 --> 24:41.620]  But if you can take one plant and dedicate it to experiments, you can learn a whole lot
[24:41.620 --> 24:45.700]  from that one plant and still produce a very viable crop.
[24:45.700 --> 24:49.060]  So if you're new at defoliating, if you're new at popping and twisting, if you're new
[24:49.060 --> 24:52.580]  at cracking the stems, maybe just pick one plant.
[24:52.580 --> 24:57.580]  Defoliate the crap out of one plant and then don't do the others and pay attention to what happens.
[24:57.580 --> 25:01.940]  Something very important to note here, take a lot of notes when you're doing experiments
[25:01.940 --> 25:03.380]  like this.
[25:03.380 --> 25:07.380]  Write down what you did to plant A, write down what you did to plant B, and then take
[25:07.380 --> 25:09.560]  great notes of the outcome.
[25:09.560 --> 25:14.020]  That is a great way to have documentation to find out if the techniques and methods
[25:14.020 --> 25:19.020]  you are using work for your garden and work for you and work for the specific strain which
[25:19.020 --> 25:20.020]  you are growing.
[25:20.020 --> 25:25.660]  I've said it before, but most of us growers are also consumers, which means sometimes
[25:25.780 --> 25:28.340]  we may forget some details.
[25:28.340 --> 25:30.980]  Write some shit down and you will not forget.
[25:30.980 --> 25:35.660]  That way, when the end comes and plant B is way better than plant A, you know exactly
[25:35.660 --> 25:39.860]  what you did to make plant B stand out from the crowd.
[25:39.860 --> 25:45.100]  Then we can repeat that, then we can improve upon that and have a better garden each and
[25:45.100 --> 25:46.540]  every time.
[25:46.540 --> 25:50.940]  So feel free to experiment with one or two plants in the garden until you develop confidence,
[25:50.940 --> 25:54.420]  and while you're experimenting, make sure to take notes.
[25:54.420 --> 25:58.140]  Now the next thing I want to talk about before we start wrapping up the show is bulbs and
[25:58.140 --> 25:59.420]  lighting.
[25:59.420 --> 26:04.420]  As we approach the third week of flower, it is time to remove our metal halide bulb and
[26:04.420 --> 26:07.360]  start using the high pressure sodium bulb.
[26:07.360 --> 26:12.360]  If you're using an LED, it's time to switch from the blue to the more red spectrum if
[26:12.360 --> 26:13.980]  that is an option.
[26:13.980 --> 26:19.220]  I like to leave my veg bulbs in for the first couple of weeks of flower because I find it
[26:19.220 --> 26:21.620]  helps reduce the stretch.
[26:21.660 --> 26:26.260]  For the first 21 days of flower, our plants are going to take off and stretch extremely
[26:26.260 --> 26:27.260]  fast.
[26:27.260 --> 26:28.780]  They're going to get really tall.
[26:28.780 --> 26:31.340]  Proper nutrients will help reduce the stretch.
[26:31.340 --> 26:34.860]  The right amount of phosphorus and potassium will reduce the stretch.
[26:34.860 --> 26:40.060]  Also, I feel like keeping in the blue light, the metal halide light for the first two weeks
[26:40.060 --> 26:45.140]  of flower will really help keep the plants short and squat and bushy.
[26:45.140 --> 26:47.940]  Now we are approaching the end of the stretch phase.
[26:47.940 --> 26:53.000]  It is time to swap out that blue bulb for the yellow orange reddish bulb, which would
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.260]  be the high pressure sodium.
[26:55.260 --> 26:59.480]  If you have not already changed out your bulb or hit the switch on your LED to change into
[26:59.480 --> 27:04.620]  the flowering mode, now is the time to swap out those bulbs or hit that switch.
[27:04.620 --> 27:10.340]  I wouldn't wait any later than day 21 to change my flowering spectrum.
[27:10.340 --> 27:13.540]  Any later than that, we start hitting a point of diminishing returns.
[27:13.540 --> 27:18.060]  We do reduce the stretch, but we also reduce the bulking when it comes time to develop
[27:18.060 --> 27:19.060]  buds.
[27:19.060 --> 27:20.140]  All right, podcast world.
[27:20.140 --> 27:23.100]  I feel like we are caught up on weeks two and three.
[27:23.100 --> 27:24.460]  We've got our nutrients covered.
[27:24.460 --> 27:26.060]  We've got our environment dialed in.
[27:26.060 --> 27:27.480]  We've added a fan.
[27:27.480 --> 27:30.260]  We have applied our final pesticide applications.
[27:30.260 --> 27:32.940]  We have released our predators if we're going to do so.
[27:32.940 --> 27:35.260]  We're going to continue popping the stems.
[27:35.260 --> 27:38.380]  We're going to continue working the tall plants into the trellis.
[27:38.380 --> 27:40.980]  We're going to keep defoliating as needed.
[27:40.980 --> 27:44.780]  Hopefully you have selected a plant to do some experiments on and you are taking good
[27:44.780 --> 27:45.780]  notes.
[27:45.780 --> 27:47.900]  We are well into the flowering cycle.
[27:47.900 --> 27:54.080]  We do need to continue keeping our eyes open for males and hermaphrodites and mutants as
[27:54.080 --> 27:56.780]  well as pests and pathogens.
[27:56.780 --> 27:58.820]  Hopefully we haven't made any nutrient mistakes.
[27:58.820 --> 28:00.820]  Hopefully we haven't had any pH issues.
[28:00.820 --> 28:03.380]  If we haven't had any light leaks, we're developing bud set.
[28:03.380 --> 28:07.180]  It looks like dandelions forming on the tips of all of our plants.
[28:07.180 --> 28:09.260]  Hopefully we have removed all of the males from the room.
[28:09.260 --> 28:13.220]  We're still keeping an eye out for males and hermaphrodites and mutants.
[28:13.220 --> 28:17.780]  Now as long as we don't run into any equipment failures or human errors, we are well on our
[28:17.780 --> 28:20.580]  way to a great harvest.
[28:20.580 --> 28:24.620]  Alright Podcast World, I feel like that is a great spot to wrap up this lesson on weeks
[28:24.620 --> 28:29.500]  two and three, or days eight through 21 of the flowering phase.
