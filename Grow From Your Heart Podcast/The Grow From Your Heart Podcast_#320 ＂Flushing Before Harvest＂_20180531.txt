[00:00.440 --> 00:04.640]  Welcome back cannabis community it's time for episode 320 of the Grow From
[00:04.640 --> 00:07.400]  Your Heart podcast. This episode is brought to you by our friends at the
[00:07.400 --> 00:11.360]  Hella Dank Seed Company. If you need new seeds for your garden I highly recommend
[00:11.360 --> 00:16.200]  the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find them at dankseed.store. Also make
[00:16.200 --> 00:19.880]  sure you check out our friends at PL Grow Systems. You can find them at
[00:19.880 --> 00:25.080]  PLGrow.Systems. Ladies and gentlemen first off let me apologize for my terrible
[00:25.080 --> 00:30.600]  sounding voice. Our friend Brett also known as Mary's Motivation had a going
[00:30.600 --> 00:35.080]  away party and I went to that going away party and I smoked way too much flour
[00:35.080 --> 00:39.160]  and way too much concentrate and my voice sounds like crap. I got a little
[00:39.160 --> 00:42.680]  bit of a chest cold, I got a throat thing going on, I got a sinus thing happening
[00:42.680 --> 00:46.240]  and before we get too far I just want to apologize and I want to thank you for
[00:46.240 --> 00:50.760]  listening to this episode while I sound like poop. Alright I'd like to start the
[00:50.760 --> 00:54.720]  episode off by letting you know what I'm smoking on. Today I'm taking Little Baby
[00:54.840 --> 00:59.040]  Dabs of Gorilla Glue 4 Ambrosia and also I've got some of the New York City
[00:59.040 --> 01:04.200]  Diesel Ambrosia Batter both from Apothecary. It's been a nice mix. I'm just
[01:04.200 --> 01:07.400]  going light today just trying to stay lightly medicated and not mess up my
[01:07.400 --> 01:11.040]  lungs and throat again. I'm on the path to recovery and I want to keep moving
[01:11.040 --> 01:16.160]  forward. So a minute ago I mentioned that I went to my friend Brett also known as
[01:16.160 --> 01:20.080]  Mary's Motivation. I went to Brett's going away party. Brett is leaving the
[01:20.080 --> 01:23.760]  country. Brett's a little scared and nervous about his trip but honestly I
[01:23.840 --> 01:27.960]  don't think anybody deserves this more. Brett needs to make this adventure
[01:27.960 --> 01:31.720]  happen. I think it's going to be a great experience for him so I'm super proud
[01:31.720 --> 01:37.480]  and super excited for him. His party was awesome. At the party we were joined by
[01:37.480 --> 01:42.360]  of course the always awesome Brett was there, Dabbing Granny and and Kevin
[01:42.360 --> 01:47.480]  showed up. Also Lucy, Mama Bear Dabs was there. Always good to see Lucy. I got to
[01:47.480 --> 01:51.080]  bump into my friend Twisty Seeds who I don't see very often. I got to have a
[01:51.080 --> 01:54.520]  conversation, a long conversation with Chandler Dabbing. That was pretty cool.
[01:54.520 --> 01:59.800]  Earl Tycoon was there. The dude from Hits on Hand was there. LJ Fresh was there and
[01:59.800 --> 02:03.920]  several other new and old friends were there hanging out. It was a great party.
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.280]  There were a couple of folks there who brought canna gars which are basically
[02:08.280 --> 02:13.200]  blunts rolled with cannabis leaves as the wrapper. That really fucked up my
[02:13.200 --> 02:17.520]  lungs you guys. My lungs did not like that at all. They were delicious to smoke
[02:17.520 --> 02:22.800]  and we got really lit but that is why I think I sound like crap today. So shout
[02:22.800 --> 02:26.120]  out to Brett for the great party. The party was a private party so not a lot
[02:26.120 --> 02:30.280]  of people were invited. The event was at Cultivated Synergy. I owe a huge shout
[02:30.280 --> 02:33.800]  out to everybody at Cultivated Synergy. Every time we do an event there, every
[02:33.800 --> 02:37.920]  time we do a large or a small party there, it goes very well. The place is
[02:37.920 --> 02:41.640]  very inviting. The staff is very accommodating and I always have a great
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.800]  time. So big shout out to everybody who came to the party. Extra huge shout out
[02:45.800 --> 02:49.760]  to Brett for inviting me who was only able to invite 30 people. I was honored
[02:49.760 --> 02:54.640]  to be amongst those 30. It was a great party you guys. We smoked that place out
[02:54.640 --> 02:57.680]  for how few people there were in there. It was a pretty big building and we
[02:57.680 --> 03:01.880]  smoked that bitch out pretty good. You can hear it in my voice still. Alright
[03:01.880 --> 03:05.680]  while I've still got some good voice left, let's do a quick podcast about
[03:05.680 --> 03:10.480]  flushing your plants before harvest. Before we talk about flushing, I should
[03:10.480 --> 03:15.400]  do a quick recap. In the last episode I talked about determining ripeness.
[03:15.720 --> 03:19.760]  Mike and I went fairly fast and we got kind of rambly so I hope I made it clear
[03:19.760 --> 03:24.040]  that determining ripeness is usually done by using some sort of a loop so
[03:24.040 --> 03:30.120]  that you can see the trichomes. I mentioned using a 60 or 100x loop. One of
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.320]  our friends from Instagram, what's up Dank Sinatra, our friend Dank Sinatra,
[03:34.320 --> 03:40.080]  sheer photo and seeds, sent me a message and he says, now I can't see trichomes
[03:40.080 --> 03:44.440]  with my naked eye but I can tell ripeness of a trichome with a 16x
[03:44.480 --> 03:49.840]  jewelers loop. He said of course in my mind I'm in my mid-20s so my eyes may
[03:49.840 --> 03:53.760]  work a little better. Yes dude you are a little bit younger than me you got those
[03:53.760 --> 03:59.560]  fresh new eyes. But he corrected me. He says he can see the trichomes with the
[03:59.560 --> 04:04.560]  16x jewelers loop so you may not need that bigger loop that 60 that 100. He
[04:04.560 --> 04:09.920]  says the 60 is working or the 16 is working for him. So I stand corrected. You
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.200]  may not need that big loop. 16 may get you through. Also let's recap a little
[04:15.200 --> 04:19.120]  bit about what I said about harvest times. I said that if you have a plant
[04:19.120 --> 04:23.440]  that is said to go 60 days let it go the full 60 days and start flushing at day
[04:23.440 --> 04:28.440]  50. If you've got a plant that's supposed to go 70 days let it go the full 70 days
[04:28.440 --> 04:34.360]  and start flushing around day 60. Now you may say Rasta Jeff I want to dial it in
[04:34.360 --> 04:38.240]  and cut these plants down at the perfect ripeness. Yes you're going to have to
[04:38.240 --> 04:41.880]  dial that in. Something I wanted to stress is this is not your last grow
[04:41.880 --> 04:46.160]  with this strain. Hopefully this is your first run with this cultivar with this
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.080]  cut. So now you've got a new girlfriend that you've got to learn a little bit.
[04:50.080 --> 04:53.360]  You've got to take her out a couple of times. You got to see if she wants to
[04:53.360 --> 05:00.440]  come down at day 60, day 63, maybe day 67, maybe day 72. You've got to dial it in
[05:00.440 --> 05:04.040]  exactly to the right day. Now you're gonna see differences if you use
[05:04.040 --> 05:07.600]  different nutrients you may get different ripening days. If you have a
[05:07.600 --> 05:11.080]  little bit of temperature difference you may get a different ripening day. So
[05:11.080 --> 05:15.280]  you're gonna have to find the window and dial that in. Hopefully this is not your
[05:15.280 --> 05:19.280]  last grow with this cut. Hopefully this is the first of many grows with a good
[05:19.280 --> 05:24.440]  cut. So if it's your first run with the 60 day cut start flushing around day 50.
[05:24.440 --> 05:28.760]  If this is your first time with a cut that you think may go 70 days start
[05:28.760 --> 05:33.160]  flushing it around day 60. Now when you get to day 60 or day 70 on whichever
[05:33.160 --> 05:36.360]  plant you're running you don't have to cut it down just because you've been
[05:36.360 --> 05:40.520]  flushing for 10 days. Start paying more attention to the trichomes. If they are
[05:40.520 --> 05:44.640]  not amber don't cut it down. Keep flushing for a few more days. It's better
[05:44.640 --> 05:48.440]  to over flush than under flush. The only thing you're doing is not giving it
[05:48.440 --> 05:51.040]  nutrients. It may have gotten a little bigger it may have gotten a little
[05:51.040 --> 05:56.320]  beefier but we're just trying to figure out the plant for the first time. So that
[05:56.320 --> 06:01.840]  is how to determine when to begin flush if you don't know the cultivar that
[06:01.840 --> 06:05.560]  you're using. Maybe it's a brand new seed, maybe it's a new clone, maybe you're just
[06:05.640 --> 06:09.360]  new at growing and you don't know when to cut it. Allowing the plant 60 to 70
[06:09.360 --> 06:13.000]  days to grow and then giving yourself extra time at the end is always your
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.080]  best bet with a new cut. Alright so I feel like I have established how to tell
[06:18.080 --> 06:21.880]  if the plant is ripe and ready to cut down and I feel like we have a good idea
[06:21.880 --> 06:26.600]  of when to start flushing. Let's actually talk about flushing our cannabis plants.
[06:26.600 --> 06:30.720]  I think flushing is super simple and it's something people could easily
[06:30.720 --> 06:34.920]  improve and they are really skipping that step and I'm not sure why because
[06:34.960 --> 06:40.040]  it's free. It's a really easy step to improve your cannabis and it is free.
[06:40.040 --> 06:45.200]  Maybe people simply don't understand the importance of flushing and why it's
[06:45.200 --> 06:49.800]  important. So let me tell you quickly why flushing matters. Just imagine you've
[06:49.800 --> 06:55.640]  been pouring salty nutrients into this plant for nine weeks of flower plus
[06:55.640 --> 06:59.000]  another three or four weeks of veg you've just been filling it up with
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.560]  nutrients. You've been pouring whatever nutrient brand you're using you've been
[07:02.560 --> 07:06.000]  pouring nitrogen you've been pouring phosphorus you've been pouring potassium
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.240]  and you've been pouring carbohydrates into these plants for the past 12 weeks.
[07:10.240 --> 07:15.000]  Now all of that stuff is built up inside of that plant. The plant is not using all
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.760]  of it. It's letting some of it go. It's turning some of it into a gas and
[07:17.760 --> 07:22.040]  transpiring some of it out but some of it is still in the plant. If those
[07:22.040 --> 07:27.040]  nutrients are left in the plant when we harvest dry and cure that plant we're
[07:27.040 --> 07:32.080]  going to taste it. The plants are going to taste like crap. If you feed too much
[07:32.080 --> 07:36.320]  cow mag too late in flower you're going to taste it. If you feed your plants too
[07:36.320 --> 07:40.440]  much potassium silicate late in flower you're going to taste it. Also the plants
[07:40.440 --> 07:44.200]  are not going to burn properly. When you dry and cure these buds they're not
[07:44.200 --> 07:47.320]  gonna smoke. You're gonna grind it up in a grinder you're gonna roll a joint and
[07:47.320 --> 07:51.180]  it's just gonna burn black and make a funky weird charcoal. That's because
[07:51.180 --> 07:55.680]  they're leftover nutrients that you did not flush out. We can get that stuff out
[07:55.680 --> 08:01.200]  of there by properly flushing the plants. You are mostly flushing the soil. You
[08:01.200 --> 08:04.560]  want to clean out the soil so there's nothing left in your medium and whether
[08:04.560 --> 08:10.160]  it's soil, soilless mix, if you got peat, whatever you're working in you're gonna
[08:10.160 --> 08:14.960]  want to flush that. If it's rock wool, if it's cocoa, you need to clean it out. Each
[08:14.960 --> 08:18.400]  thing is going to take a different amount of time to clean out but you want
[08:18.400 --> 08:22.320]  to clean that out so the roots don't have anything to eat. Then the plant will
[08:22.320 --> 08:26.440]  start starving itself and it will start showing as harvest fall colors and it
[08:26.440 --> 08:31.560]  will taste proper when you dry it, cure it, and smoke it. So that's why flushing
[08:31.560 --> 08:34.480]  is important. You want to get all those excess nutrients out of there, all those
[08:34.480 --> 08:39.080]  excess salts. When you roll a joint and smoke it you don't want it to turn into
[08:39.080 --> 08:44.080]  a little briquette. You want it to turn into a nice white fluffy ash and just
[08:44.080 --> 08:49.960]  flake away. So that comes from a properly flushed plant. Then that also comes from
[08:49.960 --> 08:54.120]  a properly dried, cured, and trimmed plant but that comes in the future. Today we're
[08:54.120 --> 08:58.080]  focusing on flushing. So that's why flushing is important. You want your
[08:58.080 --> 09:01.360]  herb to taste good, you want it to burn well, and you want it to leave a nice
[09:01.360 --> 09:07.720]  white clean soft ash with no weird chunks. So let's actually talk about
[09:07.720 --> 09:13.000]  flushing the plant. Flushing the plants is really easy. About 10 to 14 days
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.800]  before you plan on harvesting the plants, prepare the amount of water that you
[09:16.800 --> 09:20.600]  would normally water the garden with. If you've got 1,000 watt light maybe you've
[09:20.640 --> 09:23.840]  got a 5 gallon bucket full of water right? So get that amount of water ready.
[09:23.840 --> 09:28.640]  When you would normally put nutrients into the water, don't do that. Just don't
[09:28.640 --> 09:33.120]  put nutrients in there. Maybe if you're gonna add anything, put some enzymes in
[09:33.120 --> 09:37.640]  there. If you're using an enzyme that will help break down all the the decaying
[09:37.640 --> 09:41.180]  roots and all the matter inside of the root zone and it will speed up the
[09:41.180 --> 09:45.560]  process of the flush. It will help speed everything up. But enzymes are pretty
[09:45.560 --> 09:49.400]  much the only thing I would put in there other than maybe a little bit of shine.
[09:49.400 --> 09:54.000]  Maybe one to two grams of shine from veg bloom, but you really don't need it.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.680]  Mostly all you would need is some enzymes for the last couple of days. If
[09:57.680 --> 10:02.600]  you're gonna flush for 14 days, maybe go for like four to seven days, add two
[10:02.600 --> 10:06.440]  grams of shine and add some enzymes, but then cut out the shine and just keep the
[10:06.440 --> 10:10.320]  enzymes going until the end of the process. So the only thing you would put
[10:10.320 --> 10:14.360]  in there are enzymes and possibly some shine, but you would be probably just
[10:14.360 --> 10:19.360]  fine with nothing at all. So clean water, add the enzymes if you're gonna do so,
[10:19.360 --> 10:24.440]  for four to seven days add the shine if you'd like to do so, then adjust the pH
[10:24.440 --> 10:29.760]  to somewhere between 6.3 and 6.5. You'll be just fine 6.3 and 6.5. That's a good
[10:29.760 --> 10:35.280]  window to adjust it to. Then simply water the plants with that minimal solution.
[10:35.280 --> 10:38.960]  All you've got to do is pour that right into the plants just like you normally
[10:38.960 --> 10:43.080]  do when you water. Soak the plants and let it run through. Now what you're doing,
[10:43.080 --> 10:48.400]  pouring the enzymes in there, is going to help the natural decaying process happen
[10:48.400 --> 10:51.720]  inside that root zone. There's dead things in there, the roots that are dying
[10:51.720 --> 10:55.200]  are dying in there, the enzymes are gonna eat that and they're gonna speed up that
[10:55.200 --> 10:59.560]  process. Also that shine is going to keep adding density and trichomes and
[10:59.560 --> 11:03.280]  essential oils to your plants if you choose to add the shine. You still need
[11:03.280 --> 11:06.440]  to flush for the last week without the shine you guys, so make sure you cut that
[11:06.440 --> 11:09.760]  out. You can leave the enzymes in there if you'd like to at the end, but cut out
[11:09.760 --> 11:13.960]  that shine for the last week. Now you're probably at day 50 right, if we're gonna
[11:13.960 --> 11:18.040]  cut down at day 60, we're at day 50. We just mixed up a bunch of water and we
[11:18.040 --> 11:22.600]  just soaked that root zone. So now you've got pH water with enzymes and
[11:22.600 --> 11:25.840]  possibly some shine running through there. Those plants are gonna start
[11:25.840 --> 11:29.120]  looking for phosphorus and potassium and molybdenum and all the other things that
[11:29.120 --> 11:32.520]  they want. There's 16 minerals that the plants really want you guys. Start
[11:32.520 --> 11:35.240]  thinking about that and learn all 16 of them that will really help you think
[11:35.240 --> 11:38.040]  about what you're feeding your plant. Maybe we'll talk about that in the
[11:38.040 --> 11:40.720]  future, but the plants gonna start looking for that stuff and all it's
[11:40.720 --> 11:44.600]  gonna find are enzymes and shine. It's gonna be like, well I've got essential
[11:44.600 --> 11:48.320]  oils, I'm gonna go beef up my trichomes and it's got stuff to build trichomes,
[11:48.320 --> 11:51.760]  but it doesn't have the building blocks to grow more plant material. It doesn't
[11:51.760 --> 11:55.880]  have all the nutrition that it needs to keep building bigger buds and fatter
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.680]  stems and going. So it's gonna start showing you its fall colors. It's gonna
[11:59.680 --> 12:03.760]  start turning into these yellow golden colors. You may get some reds, you may get
[12:03.760 --> 12:07.480]  some purples, you'll get some unique oranges. I really like taking pictures of
[12:07.480 --> 12:10.360]  my plants right at the flush phase because they really start showing
[12:10.360 --> 12:14.560]  great colors. The buds are nice and fat, the trichomes are all greasy and shiny
[12:14.560 --> 12:18.520]  and then the leaves start getting these cool golden tones to them. But that's
[12:18.520 --> 12:22.640]  when you know that the flush is working. There are no nutrients left in that soil
[12:22.640 --> 12:26.280]  for the plant to eat and it is getting hungry, which is a good thing because now
[12:26.280 --> 12:30.720]  you know that bud is gonna burn smoothly. It's not gonna have nitrogen, phosphorus,
[12:30.720 --> 12:35.640]  potassium, molybdenum, iron, calcium, magnesium. It's not gonna have all this
[12:35.640 --> 12:38.720]  other funky shit in it that we don't want to smoke. It's just gonna be nice
[12:38.720 --> 12:43.640]  and clean. It'll burn nice and smoothly and it will taste really good. So you're
[12:43.640 --> 12:48.720]  gonna start seeing these fall colors come on. That timing is going to depend
[12:48.720 --> 12:54.120]  on your medium, how much nutrients you have been putting into the plant. It's
[12:54.120 --> 12:59.160]  gonna be very strain specific and also temperatures are going to have a huge
[12:59.160 --> 13:03.040]  effect on this. If it's a little cooler in the room, your plants are gonna turn a
[13:03.040 --> 13:06.760]  little more fall colors. If you have a lower nighttime temperature, you'll see a
[13:06.840 --> 13:11.080]  little more purple from the buds. You'll get a little more fall activity from the
[13:11.080 --> 13:15.920]  plants like what happened in nature. So you're gonna mix up the solution, you're
[13:15.920 --> 13:19.600]  gonna pH it, you're gonna water in the plant, it's gonna run out of the bottom.
[13:19.600 --> 13:25.000]  Then depending on your container size and the vapor pressure deficit in the
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.440]  room, you are going to have to water again. Repeat the process you guys. Mix up
[13:30.440 --> 13:35.240]  your container, put the enzymes in there, put the shine in there, pH adjust it to
[13:35.240 --> 13:41.120]  6.3 to 6.5 and water it right through the plants. Repeat this process right up
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.320]  to a week before harvest and then do the same thing but simply take out the shine.
[13:45.320 --> 13:52.120]  Add the enzymes, adjust the pH and then feed it right through the plants. Now the
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.520]  enzymes are totally not necessary. The shine is totally not necessary. You can
[13:56.520 --> 14:00.320]  do all of this with plain water. If you're adding the enzymes and shine, you
[14:00.320 --> 14:05.120]  are going to have connoisseur quality cannabis. That's what I would do. I would
[14:05.200 --> 14:08.800]  do the shine up to the last week, then after that I would just do the enzymes
[14:08.800 --> 14:11.980]  and then I'd probably do just two or three days of plain water just to give
[14:11.980 --> 14:16.280]  them time to finish up there. If I was going that 60 days, I would end up going
[14:16.280 --> 14:20.320]  63 and that last three days would just be plain water and micro is what would
[14:20.320 --> 14:25.480]  happen there. So just keep repeating the process. You want to rinse these plants
[14:25.480 --> 14:29.720]  out. You want to rinse the soil out as many times as you can between the start
[14:29.720 --> 14:34.200]  of flush and harvest. So if you can get it to dry up and rewater it every other
[14:34.280 --> 14:38.480]  day, that's great. If it takes three or four days, that's fine. You're still going
[14:38.480 --> 14:42.600]  to get, if you do it 12 days, you'll get three waterings in there if you go every
[14:42.600 --> 14:46.000]  four days. But if you're taking that much time to water, that means you've got a
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.320]  large container or that much time between waterings means you've got a
[14:49.320 --> 14:52.720]  large container, which means you're using quite a bit of water to flush that out,
[14:52.720 --> 14:57.400]  which means you need to make sure to get at least like 10 to 30 percent runoff
[14:57.400 --> 15:01.480]  water. So if you got like a 10 gallon pot, you're gonna want to get at least one to
[15:01.480 --> 15:04.400]  two gallons of runoff coming out of that. That's how you know you're flushing
[15:04.400 --> 15:08.040]  well. So get plenty of water coming out and then flush the shit out of those
[15:08.040 --> 15:12.360]  plants. Do it as many times as you can, but be careful not to drown the plant.
[15:12.360 --> 15:16.760]  Don't try to sneak in another flush time just to get more water in there because
[15:16.760 --> 15:20.280]  that may do more harm than good. That may, you may kill the fucking plant right
[15:20.280 --> 15:23.400]  there. You may just drown it. You may suffocate it. That may be the end. You may
[15:23.400 --> 15:27.760]  be cutting down early. So don't ruin it right at the end. Be careful. Just stay on
[15:27.760 --> 15:31.160]  your normal watering schedule. Just make sure you soak the shit out of it. Let it
[15:31.160 --> 15:35.120]  dry out. Water it again. Do that as many times as you can in the last 10 to 14
[15:35.120 --> 15:39.880]  days. And if you want to add the enzymes, do that. If you want to use shine, do that.
[15:39.880 --> 15:44.720]  Those are the only things I would really add at the end. So we have determined how
[15:44.720 --> 15:49.280]  to tell if the plants are ripe. We have determined a good time to start
[15:49.280 --> 15:53.280]  flushing. We know what to put in the water to flush the plants. We know why
[15:53.280 --> 15:58.640]  we're flushing. We know how to flush. You basically don't mix anything up and you
[15:58.640 --> 16:02.840]  run that through the plants. This will clean out the soil. That is our main goal.
[16:02.840 --> 16:06.600]  As that's happening, we're gonna see colors changing. We're gonna see trichomes
[16:06.600 --> 16:10.160]  ripening. We're gonna see plants finishing up. Now you're gonna get a
[16:10.160 --> 16:14.160]  bunch of funky, you may. I'm not promising. It depends on your genetics, your
[16:14.160 --> 16:18.200]  environment. It depends on a lot of things. You're going to get funky yellow
[16:18.200 --> 16:23.480]  leaves. You're gonna get dead foliage. Pull that stuff off. There's no problem
[16:23.480 --> 16:26.400]  with just yanking that dead stuff off. Make sure you throw it away. Get it out
[16:26.400 --> 16:30.520]  of the grow room. But just pull all that dead stuff off and throw it away. Now
[16:30.520 --> 16:35.080]  about a week, maybe five or three days before you harvest, go in the grow room
[16:35.080 --> 16:38.760]  and just start stripping off all the big leaves. This is going to save you a lot
[16:38.760 --> 16:42.800]  of time when it does come time to harvest. There won't be all these big
[16:42.800 --> 16:46.240]  giant leaves in your way. Just cut them off while the plant is standing up. While
[16:46.240 --> 16:49.000]  they're still stiff. While they're still alive. You can just snap them right off.
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.200]  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. You can go really fast. You don't even need scissors for it.
[16:52.200 --> 16:55.680]  Once you get the thumb technique of just popping a leaf off, you can just go in
[16:55.680 --> 16:59.440]  there and defoliate a whole section really quickly. So a few days before
[16:59.440 --> 17:03.520]  harvest, go in there and pull off all those big leaves. And that will save you
[17:03.520 --> 17:08.080]  a big headache and a bunch of time when it comes time to harvest the plants. You
[17:08.080 --> 17:11.360]  hang them upside down, dry them and cure them. When it comes time to trim, half the leaves
[17:11.360 --> 17:16.240]  are already gone. It will save you a lot of bullshit and a lot of trouble. So when
[17:16.240 --> 17:20.480]  you see them starting to get funky, take off the dead ones. Then just a few days
[17:20.480 --> 17:24.680]  before harvest, probably when you cut out the shine maybe, then go in there and
[17:24.680 --> 17:28.240]  start pulling off the leaves. Now another thing you might want to do is
[17:28.240 --> 17:33.600]  you might want to reduce the temperature just a few degrees. Do not create a large
[17:33.600 --> 17:40.200]  swing in temps between your day and night. Do not go too cold at night. Do not
[17:40.200 --> 17:44.160]  try to create something drastic. If you can bring it down two or three degrees
[17:44.160 --> 17:48.480]  during the day and two or three degrees during the night, do that. But don't go
[17:48.480 --> 17:51.800]  crazy you guys. Don't shock the plants right at the end. Don't give yourself
[17:51.800 --> 17:55.600]  powdery mildew right at the end. Just try to mimic nature and get a little bit
[17:55.600 --> 17:58.840]  colder right at the end. Because what happens right at the end of the season?
[17:58.840 --> 18:02.200]  It gets cold. That's how things know, oh shit it's wintertime and those plants
[18:02.200 --> 18:05.120]  will hurry up and finish. So you'll see more color, you may get a little more
[18:05.120 --> 18:10.320]  density and cool temps are good for terpenes. So lower the temperatures a
[18:10.320 --> 18:14.400]  little bit right at the end. Now one thing I'm sure people are going to send
[18:14.400 --> 18:19.600]  me messages about and ask is, do I use any flushing agents? No, I do not use a
[18:19.680 --> 18:23.880]  flushing agent. I think all of the flushing agents are kind of a sales
[18:23.880 --> 18:27.680]  tactic. They are not necessary and I think they make your herb taste like
[18:27.680 --> 18:32.680]  whatever they taste like. It's the very end. Why would I want to put in a new
[18:32.680 --> 18:37.240]  ingredient? I want to get everything out. So I do not use a flushing agent. If I
[18:37.240 --> 18:42.000]  were to use anything, I would just use the solution I told you, the enzymes
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.520]  and the shine, and then I would add powdered coconut water. Would be the only
[18:45.520 --> 18:49.320]  flushing solution that I would use. And a lot of people are saying, what? Yeah
[18:49.360 --> 18:53.240]  coconut water would be ideal, but that would get very expensive to buy it and have
[18:53.240 --> 18:56.920]  that much coconut water. Imagine trying to get a five gallon bucket of coconut
[18:56.920 --> 19:02.000]  water shipped to your house every three days for 14 days. That's gonna add up.
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.840]  It's gonna get real expensive, but you can buy powdered coconut water. It is
[19:06.840 --> 19:10.880]  readily available from a lot of growth stores. Build-A-Soil can take good care
[19:10.880 --> 19:13.480]  of you. They do not sponsor the show or anything, but I know that that's a
[19:13.480 --> 19:18.440]  reliable source for powdered coconut water. Also something I should mention, a
[19:19.160 --> 19:23.840]  lot of people are growing no-till. A lot of people are growing in living soil or
[19:23.840 --> 19:29.080]  super soil or some sort of live soil. You guys, if that is what you're working with,
[19:29.080 --> 19:33.840]  you probably do not need to flush because you have created the perfect
[19:33.840 --> 19:37.280]  environment inside your plants rhizosphere to where it's taking up what
[19:37.280 --> 19:40.800]  it needs. You're not feeding it bottled nutrients. It's not being force-fed shit
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.240]  so it doesn't need to be flushed anything. Our buddy Subcool, when he would
[19:44.240 --> 19:47.680]  mix up a batch of super soil and put a plant in there, he would just feed it
[19:47.680 --> 19:51.320]  water for the whole flowering phase and he would say, I've been flushing the
[19:51.320 --> 19:56.240]  entire time. So before people start sending me emails, yes, there are some
[19:56.240 --> 19:59.840]  situations where you may not need to flush. If you are going no-till, if you're
[19:59.840 --> 20:04.600]  going all organic, flushing is not a thing. Now if you're running that, you're
[20:04.600 --> 20:08.000]  already up to speed and you know that we don't need to teach you about flushing.
[20:08.000 --> 20:11.920]  You were in the advanced black belt class already. Now I've got one more
[20:11.920 --> 20:15.240]  thing I should mention before I wrap up this so-called quickie episode that's
[20:15.240 --> 20:18.560]  gone on for 20 minutes. You guys are very welcome, thank you for listening. A
[20:18.560 --> 20:25.880]  good thing to do is to measure the EC or the PPMs of your runoff water. You were
[20:25.880 --> 20:29.400]  pouring a bunch of water into your plants, right? Collect it. Collect the
[20:29.400 --> 20:32.040]  water that comes out of the bottom of your plant into some sort of a vessel.
[20:32.040 --> 20:38.160]  Put your pH pen in there. Put your EC or PPM pen in there and see what the EC is.
[20:38.160 --> 20:42.040]  Now if you're in a soil or a soil-less mix, you're only gonna get down so low. If
[20:42.040 --> 20:46.640]  you're in cocoa, you can get those PPMs down really really low. See how low you
[20:46.640 --> 20:51.760]  can get it. Maybe before you start flushing, that day, the first day you
[20:51.760 --> 20:55.600]  flush, measure what comes out. Then measure each time and see how low you
[20:55.600 --> 20:58.600]  can get it and then just keep experimenting. See how low it goes every
[20:58.600 --> 21:02.080]  day and see how low you can get the PPMs. I don't want to give any
[21:02.080 --> 21:05.440]  recommendations on how low to try and get it because it's going to vary based
[21:05.440 --> 21:08.860]  on your medium and I don't want to fuck up your grow. You're going to have to
[21:08.860 --> 21:12.160]  learn this based on your grow. Cocoa, you'll get it really low because cocoa
[21:12.160 --> 21:16.140]  is inert. Cocoa is not going to hold shit. Same thing with rockwool. You'll be able
[21:16.140 --> 21:20.140]  to get the PPMs of your rockwool and your cocoa down to amazingly low levels.
[21:20.140 --> 21:23.980]  Soil, soil-less mixes, those are still going to have some high PPMs because
[21:23.980 --> 21:28.220]  they are soil and soil-less mixes. There's just a lot of shit in there. But
[21:28.220 --> 21:32.140]  play with your runoff. Pay attention to that. See how low you can get it and it'll
[21:32.140 --> 21:35.140]  be a lot of fun. It'll be a fun experiment and then you'll actually see
[21:35.140 --> 21:38.620]  what's going in and what's coming out of your plant. Maybe we should just talk
[21:38.620 --> 21:42.820]  about measuring runoff anyway in a full episode. We'll talk about checking the
[21:42.820 --> 21:46.500]  EC or the PPMs of a solution before you pour it into your plants and then we'll
[21:46.500 --> 21:51.060]  remeasure that same solution, the EC or the PPMs, when it comes out of the
[21:51.060 --> 21:54.580]  bottom of your plants and we'll compare that to the pH going in and the pH
[21:54.580 --> 21:58.060]  coming out and we'll see what's happening in your rhizosphere. Anyway,
[21:58.060 --> 22:02.740]  that's a future episode. I'm just getting excited. You guys, measure the electrical
[22:02.740 --> 22:05.860]  conductivity or the particles per million of what's coming out of your
[22:05.860 --> 22:09.780]  plant and you will know if you need to flush more or not. And then when you cut
[22:09.780 --> 22:13.620]  it down, write down the PPMs and then pay attention. And then if you are satisfied,
[22:13.620 --> 22:17.020]  hit that number next time. And if you're not satisfied, maybe flush a little
[22:17.020 --> 22:20.780]  longer and try to go lower. But don't be discouraged because it's not all about
[22:20.780 --> 22:24.380]  the flush. You still have dry and cure to fuck this up. You could ruin your whole
[22:24.380 --> 22:28.100]  crop after you cut it down. So ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for
[22:28.100 --> 22:33.020]  listening to my flushing episode. So far we have done determining ripeness,
[22:33.180 --> 22:37.580]  determining when to flush. We've talked about flushing. I think the next episode
[22:37.580 --> 22:42.820]  in line is harvesting and then after that we're going to do the dry and cure
[22:42.820 --> 22:45.580]  episode. There will be some interruptions to that schedule because I've got an
[22:45.580 --> 22:49.580]  episode scheduled with some friends and things always pop up. But those are on
[22:49.580 --> 22:53.340]  the chart to come up in order. Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you for
[22:53.340 --> 22:57.020]  listening to my podcast. Thanks for letting me ramble for so long. If you
[22:57.020 --> 23:00.420]  felt like this podcast was educational and you learned something and you would
[23:00.420 --> 23:04.020]  like to contribute to the podcast financially, I would truly appreciate
[23:04.020 --> 23:09.020]  the support and you can do so by going to patreon.com slash grow from your
[23:09.020 --> 23:12.580]  heart and all of the information that you need to sign up will be right there.
[23:12.740 --> 23:16.020]  It is really simple and I would appreciate the support. I'm not begging
[23:16.020 --> 23:19.740]  for payments or contributions or anything. I will do this podcast forever
[23:19.940 --> 23:23.780]  for free. I'm really not trying to get rich off of podcasting, but there are a
[23:23.780 --> 23:27.140]  few people who said they would like to contribute to the podcast. I like to
[23:27.140 --> 23:32.300]  make sure there is an opportunity for that. It is patreon.com slash grow from
[23:32.300 --> 23:35.580]  your heart. What I will do with those funds is I will pay for my website. You
[23:35.580 --> 23:40.180]  guys, I host this podcast on my website. It costs a little bit of money to do
[23:40.180 --> 23:43.940]  that every year. Also, I purchased a better Mac book so that I can record
[23:44.420 --> 23:48.380]  more efficiently. My old computer was not efficient is the polite way to say
[23:48.380 --> 23:51.660]  it, but the contributions will help to go pay for the Mac book that I bought
[23:51.660 --> 23:55.220]  and also cover the cost of the website. Also, you may have heard Mike mentioned
[23:55.220 --> 23:58.900]  the little microphone cover needed replacement. I use the funding for
[23:58.900 --> 24:02.380]  things like that. If you'd like to contribute, I would appreciate it. I will
[24:02.380 --> 24:06.420]  quit begging because that got uncomfortable quite quickly. Ladies and
[24:06.420 --> 24:08.980]  gentlemen, I would love it if you would stalk me on all of the social media.
[24:08.980 --> 24:12.380]  That is free. All you got to do is click around. Find me on Facebook. Simply
[24:12.380 --> 24:15.340]  search for the grow from your heart podcast. You can find me on Twitter.
[24:15.340 --> 24:19.100]  It's at GFYH podcast. You can find my personal account if you're interested in
[24:19.100 --> 24:24.420]  trolling me. I'm rostageff420 on Twitter. Also, you should check me out on
[24:24.460 --> 24:28.980]  Instagram. I'm irie underscore genetics on Instagram. I like to do live feeds
[24:28.980 --> 24:32.620]  where I go on Instagram live and I hang out and take a couple of dabs and then
[24:32.620 --> 24:36.380]  I take questions from the Instagram live feed and I will rant about your
[24:36.380 --> 24:39.980]  question and teach you how to grow cannabis right there on the spot. I think
[24:39.980 --> 24:43.380]  it's fun because there's no notes. There's no preparation. Today, somebody
[24:43.380 --> 24:46.780]  asked me a fairly in-depth question and I had to stare into the sky and roll my
[24:46.780 --> 24:50.620]  eyes for about two minutes and try to word out the reply I was trying to give
[24:50.620 --> 24:54.180]  them because I wasn't prepared and it's really a lot of fun for me. It's kind of
[24:54.940 --> 24:58.740]  a game of stump the grower or stump the breeder or something like that and I
[24:58.740 --> 25:01.980]  really find it it's good for my brain. It keeps my brain going. It keeps my
[25:01.980 --> 25:06.100]  growth knowledge on the tip of my tongue and it keeps my brain active. You guys
[25:06.100 --> 25:09.340]  know that I had a brain injury a few years ago so I like to do things to keep
[25:09.340 --> 25:14.260]  my brain going the right direction. Anyway, I'm fucking ranting today you
[25:14.260 --> 25:17.900]  guys. Who needs a quick episode right? Find me on Instagram. I think you would
[25:17.900 --> 25:21.980]  enjoy my Instagram live videos. Also, why wouldn't you want to check out some dope
[25:22.140 --> 25:27.460]  ass cannabis photography? Go check it out. Also, you guys, one more thing. YouTube. I
[25:27.460 --> 25:31.500]  have got all of the videos up on YouTube. You can find every episode of the Grow
[25:31.500 --> 25:35.420]  From Your Heart podcast on YouTube now. Hopefully, we are able to get a larger
[25:35.420 --> 25:38.420]  audience. We can reach more people. We can teach more people how to grow better
[25:38.420 --> 25:42.860]  cannabis. We can dispel more myths. We can educate more people by having another
[25:42.860 --> 25:46.500]  platform. So make sure you support the YouTube channel. Go click subscribe. Go
[25:46.500 --> 25:50.380]  like some videos. Go leave some silly comments. I would appreciate the support
[25:50.380 --> 25:53.580]  because I think that's all I've got for you today. This was a super rambly
[25:53.580 --> 25:56.460]  episode. I want to thank you guys for hanging out with me. I want to thank you
[25:56.460 --> 26:00.180]  again for tolerating my raspy crappy voice. I feel like I talked it right out.
[26:00.180 --> 26:03.300]  By the end of the episode, I finally sound pretty decent now that the show is
[26:03.300 --> 26:06.500]  over. So thanks for tolerating that at the start of the show. You guys, I'll be
[26:06.500 --> 26:09.700]  back Monday with a fresh new episode. I want to give a huge shout out to my
[26:09.700 --> 26:14.180]  friend Texan Toker and until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug
[26:14.180 --> 26:16.540]  for me.
