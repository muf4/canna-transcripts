[00:10.750 --> 00:19.670]  Yeah. What's up, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:19.670 --> 00:23.070]  it's time for episode number 75 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.370 --> 00:27.570]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:27.570 --> 00:29.530]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.570 --> 00:33.010]  if you're a new smoker or a hardcore dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:33.170 --> 00:35.730]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.770 --> 00:39.850]  this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host, Roston Jeff.
[00:39.850 --> 00:41.490]  Thanks again for joining me as always.
[00:41.870 --> 00:44.190]  I want to send a huge thank you. Shout out to the Mystic Roots band.
[00:44.230 --> 00:46.370]  Thanks for letting me use your music on the show guys. Huge.
[00:46.370 --> 00:49.470]  Thanks to Kat Coup and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:50.670 --> 00:53.230]  Thank you guys for joining me again. I'm going to do another news episode.
[00:53.490 --> 00:56.250]  Sitting across the table from me is our good news buddy, white Mike.
[00:56.250 --> 00:59.910]  How you doing bro? I'm doing well, man. How are you? I am great. Uh,
[00:59.910 --> 01:01.190]  I'm going to share way too much right here.
[01:01.190 --> 01:04.310]  I've got way too much information in this opening story that I want to tell
[01:04.390 --> 01:06.030]  over share time guys. It's kind of a,
[01:06.070 --> 01:09.430]  it's kind of a question to you and to whoever else may be listening.
[01:09.430 --> 01:11.650]  I'm going to drop down the music for a minute. Um,
[01:12.330 --> 01:14.490]  so my question to you guys, and I'm going to,
[01:15.530 --> 01:17.250]  I shared a lot of my personal life on this show.
[01:17.250 --> 01:19.990]  I've talked about my use of a medicated personal lubricants.
[01:20.010 --> 01:22.850]  I've talked about what CBD does to me. Um,
[01:22.890 --> 01:26.130]  have you guys ever noticed that you can take a dab or even flowers do it,
[01:26.150 --> 01:28.650]  but dabs have definitely made it happen more. Uh,
[01:28.650 --> 01:31.650]  have you ever smoked a certain strain and it made you have to poop right away?
[01:33.770 --> 01:35.530]  You went silent on me. No, I just,
[01:36.110 --> 01:40.630]  I'm going to give the question the thought that I would a rational question.
[01:40.750 --> 01:44.950]  All right. Uh, I have noticed that occasionally, uh,
[01:44.950 --> 01:47.510]  there will be a certain strain that'll come around and I'll take a dab.
[01:47.550 --> 01:51.150]  And almost every time I dab it, I will get the urge to poop right away.
[01:52.430 --> 01:55.470]  There was, I had a phenotype of deadhead. Oh gee,
[01:55.910 --> 01:58.510]  it was deadhead. Oh gee. Number two was the phenotype.
[01:58.590 --> 02:01.550]  Every time I smoked it, bro, I would get like, Oh, I've need,
[02:01.630 --> 02:03.590]  I'm needing to fart right now. I gotta go poop.
[02:04.090 --> 02:09.010]  Yeah. I know those specific cannabinoids that have been found to really help
[02:09.010 --> 02:12.770]  with digestive issues. Well then it's probably got to be a part of that.
[02:13.370 --> 02:18.290]  I don't know which one it is, but you may have stumbled into a strand that's high
[02:18.290 --> 02:21.370]  in it. Okay. Well something we dab tonight.
[02:25.530 --> 02:28.410]  That's what I'm going to blame it on because I was cool. And then we took a dab.
[02:28.410 --> 02:31.810]  Which dabs are you blaming this on? Well, the change in the menu,
[02:31.830 --> 02:36.110]  the new addition that we've been trying a lot tonight is this headband and uh,
[02:36.950 --> 02:41.390]  I have, I've been dabbing the headband as well. Okay. It's not the weed then.
[02:41.410 --> 02:45.350]  Okay. So we're eating fucking black bean burgers. You dirty hippie.
[02:46.470 --> 02:50.990]  Oh man. Trying to play. So listeners, I'm curious. Tweet me, find me on Facebook,
[02:51.010 --> 02:52.750]  do something, interact with me. Let me know.
[02:52.750 --> 02:55.430]  Is there a certain strain that when you smoke it makes you have to poop?
[02:55.670 --> 02:57.670]  I'm just curious. I want to know if this is just me.
[02:58.010 --> 03:00.130]  Tweet that at a Russ. Yeah. Yeah.
[03:00.450 --> 03:04.930]  Do it to the at GFYH podcast on Twitter or find me on Facebook or you can send me
[03:04.930 --> 03:07.890]  an email. Let's grow from your heart at hotmail.com. All right.

[03:23.970 --> 03:27.650]  I'd love to have your product featured on the podcast. Um,
[03:27.670 --> 03:31.850]  let's see, we've got a bunch of news. It's going to be a news filled episode.
[03:32.650 --> 03:34.690]  Get ready for some news. Y'all. Yes.
[03:34.730 --> 03:38.250]  I think my first news article is going to be pretty good or it'll be a good way
[03:38.250 --> 03:43.050]  to kick down the door. Um, so we've talked about taking a poop. Um,
[03:43.130 --> 03:45.210]  I think we can just get right to the news after that, right?
[03:46.570 --> 03:49.650]  Dive right in. All right, let's do this.
[03:50.690 --> 03:54.610]  I'm going to take a small sip of some beverage here and get my throat nice and
[03:54.630 --> 03:57.530]  clear before we get into this news here. Mike say something useful.
[03:58.210 --> 04:03.010]  This, uh, this isn't quite a fair, uh, back and forth with me and Jeff right now.
[04:03.010 --> 04:07.690]  He has a laptop and a pile of notes and a smartphone that's linked to the
[04:07.690 --> 04:09.610]  wifi. And I have my memory.
[04:09.930 --> 04:13.690]  You want me to pass you this pile of hash and a dabber and an email,
[04:13.690 --> 04:16.770]  and then that can be your job. I'll keep the news and the show going.
[04:16.770 --> 04:18.290]  And you can just keep us nice and dad.
[04:18.810 --> 04:19.630]  That's fair.
[04:20.690 --> 04:23.170]  I think that beverage dislodged something I shouldn't even have done.
[04:23.170 --> 04:26.330]  What do we got here now that it's in my control. Some more headband.
[04:26.350 --> 04:28.670]  I'll throw down this Durban poison or the headband. We could dabble.
[04:28.670 --> 04:33.510]  It was so freaking good. Here's some Tora Bora. That's super high CBD sap stuff.
[04:33.590 --> 04:35.790]  Actually, I'm going to go with the Torah. Um,
[04:35.910 --> 04:40.470]  if I can reach this bag until after we get done with the main news article for
[04:40.470 --> 04:43.110]  today's show, that's going to be hard to work with. Uh,
[04:43.130 --> 04:45.910]  it's a little sappier than what you're used to, but you'll figure it out.
[04:45.990 --> 04:50.990]  I've also got some AJ sour diesel and I have got
[04:50.990 --> 04:55.670]  some, um, it's like honey. Oh, nope.
[04:55.690 --> 04:59.090]  Just more sour diesel and more Durban poison. I think you can tell what I like.
[04:59.690 --> 05:01.050]  I like these sativa dabs.
[05:01.450 --> 05:05.930]  So delicious. And that Durban was quite delicious. Thank you.
[05:05.970 --> 05:06.810]  Turpex.
[05:06.850 --> 05:10.290]  Yes. Shout out to the boys at Turpex. What up Turpex boys and shout out to my
[05:10.290 --> 05:13.130]  friends at green and healthy wellness hunt. What's up brother.
[05:13.610 --> 05:16.690]  Can't wait to see you again. What's up damsel. Hope you're doing well. Uh,
[05:16.730 --> 05:19.450]  what's up John Randall's jr. Hope you're doing well brother.
[05:19.450 --> 05:21.370]  I hope you're playing some video games and having a great time.
[05:21.770 --> 05:24.850]  I fell as I saw the shop and I liked it. Keep up the good work.
[05:25.270 --> 05:26.830]  Yeah. If you're in Pueblo, Colorado,
[05:26.830 --> 05:28.870]  I recommend the spot dispensary in Pueblo West.
[05:28.870 --> 05:32.350]  But if you're in Colorado Springs and you're looking for good flowers and or
[05:32.350 --> 05:35.550]  concentrates, I definitely recommend that you hit green and healthy wellness.
[05:36.110 --> 05:40.430]  It's on a two 12 South Colorado. Pretty sure that's the address.
[05:40.630 --> 05:43.950]  So go there, buy stuff, support the community. It's a medical only shop.
[05:44.070 --> 05:46.990]  I should mention that you cannot get in there without a medical marijuana
[05:47.010 --> 05:47.830]  recommendation.
[05:48.190 --> 05:51.590]  Green and healthy is medical. The spot is rec.
[05:52.130 --> 05:56.170]  The spot is recreational. Everybody can go to the spot if you're 21 and up.
[05:56.450 --> 05:59.510]  Everybody go to this button. All right. Nobody's paying me to say this shit.
[05:59.510 --> 06:02.290]  Let's read the news. Uh, here you go. You guys,
[06:05.450 --> 06:07.370]  if you don't mind, bro, would you throw me one of the Durbin poison?
[06:07.450 --> 06:09.970]  That's what I was going to say. Toss me another dab. Would you pour a favor?
[06:10.890 --> 06:13.890]  There you go, bro. Um, all right, so here's a great headline.
[06:13.890 --> 06:16.210]  One of the best headlines I've gotten to read on the show in a little while.
[06:16.210 --> 06:20.250]  It says the U S finally admits cannabis kills cancer cells.
[06:20.750 --> 06:23.550]  That is great news because now that they're admitting it,
[06:23.590 --> 06:28.070]  maybe we can start decriminalizing it and using it as medicine all over the
[06:28.070 --> 06:28.470]  country.
[06:28.470 --> 06:33.390]  Oh, don't jump to conclusions. These are hopes and dreams. I know a man can dream.
[06:33.390 --> 06:36.150]  Can't they really are? I sent you this and this was a,
[06:36.630 --> 06:38.990]  one of the highlights in my week was reading this story.
[06:38.990 --> 06:43.770]  I actually I caught the journal article that it talks about a few months back,
[06:43.770 --> 06:46.550]  but I'm glad to see it start to make the press.
[06:46.650 --> 06:51.130]  Guys, that sound is parchment paper. How large a W would you like, sir? Um,
[06:51.770 --> 06:55.570]  can you eyeball out a 0.3 if I told you a 0.3? No,
[06:56.410 --> 07:00.130]  but I just saw why they calls it shadow. Yes. The tip is the,
[07:00.130 --> 07:03.690]  at the tip of the dabber will chip the shatter in your eye. That's a good dab.
[07:03.690 --> 07:06.770]  That's I'd probably say that's like 0.2. Nice try. That's good enough for me.
[07:07.090 --> 07:10.970]  That was the piece that came off nice and smooth. Gorgeous. All right,
[07:10.970 --> 07:13.450]  so I should probably read the news article I've teased you guys about.
[07:13.590 --> 07:16.990]  So it says a group of federal researchers commissioned by the government to
[07:16.990 --> 07:21.990]  prove that cannabis has no acceptable accepted medical use may have unwittingly
[07:22.230 --> 07:23.950]  let information slip through the cracks,
[07:23.950 --> 07:26.710]  revealing how cannabis actually kills cancer cells.
[07:27.710 --> 07:32.430]  So this is the beautiful thing about kind of how we got here. Um,
[07:32.430 --> 07:36.470]  just to step back for a second, uh, and do my obnoxious thing.
[07:36.870 --> 07:41.230]  That's great. Cause I want to dab. I saw you wanting it. So I grabbed the mic.
[07:41.770 --> 07:42.610]  Um,
[07:44.370 --> 07:49.370]  cannabis fanatics and supporters and advocates don't get to do federal research
[07:50.090 --> 07:51.890]  studies. Um,
[07:52.730 --> 07:57.330]  researchers do and the feds have blocked most research, not looking for harm.
[07:57.650 --> 08:01.610]  So all the studies we have showing how safe cannabis is and what an effective
[08:01.610 --> 08:05.010]  medicine it is. Most of those studies are studies that were like,
[08:05.010 --> 08:09.810]  find out that it proves that it causes lung cancer. That's your job. Right?
[08:09.810 --> 08:10.710]  Find that link.
[08:11.230 --> 08:16.110]  And then one of the top researchers spends a couple of years looking at cannabis
[08:16.110 --> 08:19.890]  use and lung function and finds out that it doesn't cause cancer,
[08:19.890 --> 08:21.590]  that it increases lung function.
[08:22.270 --> 08:25.350]  It's just one of those fun things about cannabis. And this is another great
[08:25.350 --> 08:26.190]  example.
[08:26.430 --> 08:28.950]  All right. I'm, I'm recovered from my dab. Nice fill in. Thank you.
[08:29.750 --> 08:30.590]  All right. It says,
[08:31.630 --> 08:32.510]  it says the research,
[08:32.510 --> 08:34.790]  which was conducted by a team of scientists at St.
[08:34.790 --> 08:38.390]  George's university of London found that the two most common cannabinoids in
[08:38.410 --> 08:42.570]  marijuana, tetra hydro cannabinoid, which is THC and cannabidiol,
[08:42.570 --> 08:46.410]  which is our favorite CBD weakened the ferocity of cancer cells and made them
[08:46.410 --> 08:50.530]  more susceptible to radiation treatment said Mike Adams of herbal dispatch.
[08:51.370 --> 08:56.170]  So the main two cannabinoids in marijuana,
[08:56.210 --> 08:59.030]  they say marijuana a lot in this article in cannabis,
[08:59.630 --> 09:04.210]  weaken the ferocity of cancer cells and make them more susceptible to
[09:04.210 --> 09:08.290]  radiation treatment. So cannabis is kicking cancer's ass.
[09:08.310 --> 09:10.270]  Is what it's saying right there, right? Making it more.
[09:10.310 --> 09:11.750]  That's exactly what it's saying.
[09:11.750 --> 09:12.950]  Making it it's bitch.
[09:13.270 --> 09:17.670]  And this is not the first research study to find exactly that,
[09:17.710 --> 09:20.310]  that something in the marijuana plant,
[09:20.310 --> 09:24.950]  likely THC or CBD is triggering what they call
[09:24.950 --> 09:29.630]  apoptosis. And that's when your cell and your cell in your body is supposed to
[09:29.630 --> 09:33.150]  die. It, apoptosis happens in the cell dies.
[09:33.510 --> 09:36.670]  It's replaced by a new cell. Everything's great. Cancer,
[09:36.690 --> 09:38.690]  the cell doesn't die and grows out of control.
[09:39.250 --> 09:41.930]  Cannabis triggers the cells tells it it's time to die.
[09:42.490 --> 09:47.250]  The second federal medical marijuana patient ever has been shouting this from
[09:47.250 --> 09:51.850]  the rooftops for years. Is that a herb? That's Irv. Shout out to Irv.
[09:52.210 --> 09:55.410]  Irvin Rosenfeld. Everybody, if you haven't heard that name before, Google it,
[09:55.450 --> 09:57.170]  Google it, read his book. I recommend it.
[09:57.190 --> 10:01.730]  His story will blow your fucking mind. There you go. Read more books. You guys,
[10:01.770 --> 10:04.610]  he gets to smoke joints at a special room in Disneyland. People,
[10:05.590 --> 10:09.110]  he took the U S federal government to court and said,
[10:09.150 --> 10:12.990]  cannabis is the best medicine for me. Fuck you. Tell me otherwise.
[10:12.990 --> 10:17.590]  And one in federal court and can smoke joints anywhere on the road at work,
[10:17.630 --> 10:22.070]  across from the DEA headquarters at the DEA headquarters, a stockbroker,
[10:22.390 --> 10:24.530]  anywhere you're allowed to consume tobacco. You're,
[10:24.550 --> 10:26.430]  he's allowed to consume cannabis.
[10:26.750 --> 10:31.630]  The feds ship him 11 ounces a month for free for free for free.
[10:31.730 --> 10:33.810]  I've seen that urban. You couldn't pay me to smoke it.
[10:34.450 --> 10:38.410]  True. But 11 ounces a month for free.
[10:38.490 --> 10:42.130]  It's exactly what it needs. It's kept him alive. He'd be dead without it.
[10:43.330 --> 10:47.130]  He's the world record holder for most joints smoked in a lifetime.
[10:47.210 --> 10:51.090]  Like sorry, Snoop, but Irv's records confirmed. He gets the gold.
[10:51.130 --> 10:51.970]  Yeah, that's true.
[10:52.890 --> 10:57.530]  Snoop's probably smoked the most blunts and also post the most Instagram
[10:57.530 --> 11:01.330]  posts. That's an award Snoop can win for sure.
[11:01.630 --> 11:04.310]  All right, I'm going to read more of this article. It says the study,
[11:04.310 --> 11:07.150]  which was published last year in the medical journal, uh,
[11:07.150 --> 11:08.310]  molecular cancer,
[11:08.310 --> 11:12.670]  cancer therapies details the dramatic reductions in fatal variations of brain
[11:12.670 --> 11:12.990]  cancer.
[11:12.990 --> 11:16.710]  When these specific cannabinoids were used in conjunction with radiation
[11:16.730 --> 11:20.510]  therapy. Uh, so they didn't try it without radiation,
[11:20.630 --> 11:23.310]  but it said it helped with radiation in conjunction.
[11:23.350 --> 11:25.870]  So marijuana can kill certain cancer cells.
[11:26.550 --> 11:29.790]  We've shown that cannabinoids could play a role in treating one of the most
[11:29.810 --> 11:34.370]  aggressive cancers in adults wrote lead researcher, dr. Wei Lee.
[11:34.530 --> 11:36.530]  I hope I said that right. I apologize. Uh,
[11:36.530 --> 11:40.890]  in a November 2014 op-ed for the Washington post, the results are promising.
[11:41.090 --> 11:45.970]  It could provide a way of breaking through gyloma tumors and saving more
[11:45.970 --> 11:48.650]  lives. And then here's a little sub headline.
[11:48.650 --> 11:51.890]  It says recent animal studies have shown that marijuana can kill certain cancer
[11:51.890 --> 11:54.170]  cells and reduce the size of others. Uh,
[11:54.170 --> 11:59.010]  the NIDA report said evidence from one animal study suggests that extracts from
[11:59.150 --> 12:02.430]  whole plant marijuana can shrink one of the most serious types of brain tumors.
[12:02.630 --> 12:07.070]  Research in mice showed that these extracts when used with radiation increased
[12:07.070 --> 12:11.110]  the cancer killing effects of the radiation. Uh,
[12:11.150 --> 12:13.110]  then it goes on to say, uh,
[12:13.150 --> 12:18.070]  NIDA is new found pro pot position is especially curious given that it
[12:18.070 --> 12:22.170]  was revealed on the heels of a recent proposal introduced to both Congress and
[12:22.170 --> 12:23.230]  the house of representative,
[12:23.250 --> 12:27.710]  which attempts to legalize medical marijuana on a national level, the bill,
[12:27.930 --> 12:31.810]  which is called the careers act, the carers act, I'm sorry, uh,
[12:31.810 --> 12:35.870]  seeks to downgrade the schedule one status of marijuana to a schedule two in
[12:35.870 --> 12:39.290]  order to make the herb more flexible in the eyes of the federal government as an
[12:39.290 --> 12:42.130]  acceptable form of medicine. In addition,
[12:42.130 --> 12:46.970]  the bill would also remove cannabidiol the non-intoxicating compound of the pot
[12:46.970 --> 12:50.810]  plant. Somebody finally said compound and didn't call it a fucking ingredient.
[12:50.810 --> 12:53.990]  I'm proud of these people. That's awesome. It's nice to see somebody finally.
[12:54.010 --> 12:55.850]  Yes. I wonder if they heard the podcast though.
[12:55.870 --> 12:58.830]  Somebody heard you call them out. Uh, cause I used the word compound.
[12:58.830 --> 13:01.390]  I was like, they should say compound. Uh, anyway, uh,
[13:01.430 --> 13:06.190]  they are removing cannabidiol the non-intoxicating compound of the pot plant
[13:06.190 --> 13:10.430]  from the controlled substances act to allow it to be distributed on a state to
[13:10.430 --> 13:13.710]  state basis without violating federal statutes.
[13:13.990 --> 13:17.350]  Cannabis became a schedule one drug in 1970 with the passing of the controlled
[13:17.350 --> 13:21.510]  substances act, which classified cannabis as having a high potential for abuse,
[13:21.530 --> 13:25.110]  no medical usage and unsafe to use without medical supervision.
[13:25.610 --> 13:29.450]  This federal research basically conducts cannabis, uh,
[13:29.490 --> 13:32.610]  contradicts cannabis is schedule one status.
[13:32.850 --> 13:37.410]  Could this mean reform is closer than we'd originally imagined? So yeah, is,
[13:37.690 --> 13:40.970]  is this the floodgate right here for cannabis reform now that we have found out
[13:40.970 --> 13:42.610]  that it actually does kill cancer?
[13:43.730 --> 13:47.290]  No. And I say that with,
[13:47.770 --> 13:52.530]  with absolutely no doubt because we've had the federal government holds a patent
[13:52.710 --> 13:56.990]  of for cannabis is a neuroprotective. That's kind of what I was headed years.
[13:58.070 --> 14:01.910]  Um, the federal medical marijuana programs as old as we are, as old as I am,
[14:02.590 --> 14:04.430]  um, it's 32, 33 years old now.
[14:04.990 --> 14:08.390]  And they've known a lot of this for decades. They don't care.
[14:08.430 --> 14:11.070]  They just don't want to admit it. And now if they do admit it,
[14:11.110 --> 14:14.710]  do you think that that's going to open the pharmaceutical company floodgates to
[14:14.710 --> 14:18.270]  where they want to make and patent cannabis products? And it's,
[14:18.310 --> 14:21.470]  I think as soon as it tips federally legal,
[14:21.930 --> 14:26.370]  the pharma industry, the tobacco industry, um,
[14:26.730 --> 14:31.130]  everybody's going to try to jump in it if they can, or if they're, you know,
[14:31.130 --> 14:35.410]  if they have a desire to, a lot of people want, there's still that big, it's,
[14:35.730 --> 14:38.890]  it's a moral, right. But I don't think any of the,
[14:39.010 --> 14:41.850]  if you put big and then capitalize the name of the industry,
[14:41.850 --> 14:43.170]  I don't think they're going to care.
[14:43.210 --> 14:46.970]  The tobacco industry is not moral. No, they're killing you anyway.
[14:47.010 --> 14:48.650]  So if they've got one more product,
[14:48.650 --> 14:51.990]  they can sell you because it's, they're not going to lose cigarette smokers.
[14:52.110 --> 14:53.790]  What do you want to do right after we get stoned?
[14:53.790 --> 14:55.670]  The first thing you want to do is smoke a cigarette.
[14:55.670 --> 14:57.710]  So now they'll have two products to sell you.
[14:57.710 --> 15:00.830]  And then you're going to be buying them all day long. Uh, you don't think that,
[15:01.190 --> 15:04.190]  uh, who is it? Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds are those cigarette companies.
[15:04.190 --> 15:05.310]  It's who rings a bell in my head.
[15:05.670 --> 15:07.830]  No, you got to, you pulled two names, correct.
[15:08.710 --> 15:10.950]  The alpha brain dude. We're going to attribute that to alpha brain.
[15:10.950 --> 15:13.390]  Do you think attribute that shit to advertising? Motherfucker.
[15:15.030 --> 15:18.190]  Do you think those guys are lined up? They're like fucking yes.
[15:18.250 --> 15:19.090]  No, no, no.
[15:20.210 --> 15:22.610]  Ready to run. As soon as someone says hike, they're going to go.
[15:22.810 --> 15:23.630]  Um,
[15:24.170 --> 15:27.410]  there's definite evidence that different tobacco companies are definitely
[15:27.430 --> 15:30.810]  looking into marijuana legalization and have been since the seventies.
[15:31.170 --> 15:33.930]  Cause we got really close in the seventies. Nobody seems to remember this.
[15:34.530 --> 15:38.730]  But Jimmy Carter Carter almost was the president who legalized it. Almost.
[15:38.770 --> 15:40.170]  I wasn't there for that. I showed up late.
[15:40.250 --> 15:45.170]  No, I wasn't there for that either, but it's part of the history. Um, but, uh,
[15:45.830 --> 15:48.670]  yeah. Where the fuck were we? I just dabbed out for a minute.
[15:48.670 --> 15:51.270]  Oh man. I saw you look at your hand. You looked at your fingernails.
[15:51.270 --> 15:54.030]  Like I'm not sure what I'm saying right now. Yep. All right.
[15:54.030 --> 15:55.510]  So now they have found out that,
[15:55.910 --> 15:59.630]  that cannabis will kill cancer cells and we're worried that it's going to go to
[15:59.630 --> 16:02.350]  the pharmaceutical companies. Big tobacco is going to jump in.
[16:03.550 --> 16:05.590]  Tobacco companies have been looking at it in the seventies.
[16:05.590 --> 16:08.950]  That's where the fuck I was going. There you go. Um, but never seriously,
[16:08.950 --> 16:13.510]  there's some serious problems with like a lot of people just assume, Oh, well,
[16:13.530 --> 16:17.370]  all Marlboro has to do is plant huge fields, sour diesel,
[16:17.770 --> 16:20.530]  and then they can put out cartons of Marlboro's just like, no,
[16:21.250 --> 16:24.410]  a it doesn't grow like tobacco B it doesn't dry like tobacco.
[16:24.410 --> 16:27.930]  See it doesn't cure like tobacco D it doesn't roll through the same machines as
[16:27.930 --> 16:28.450]  tobacco.
[16:28.450 --> 16:32.690]  Like they would literally have to build the whole infrastructure up from scratch.
[16:33.130 --> 16:35.730]  They can't just convert their existing. Right?
[16:35.730 --> 16:40.450]  So there's that hurdle for everybody on top of which Colorado Dixie elixirs is
[16:40.470 --> 16:43.750]  already. I mean, they're already done.
[16:44.670 --> 16:47.910]  They're already set up all that infrastructure is already built. Wow.
[16:47.990 --> 16:51.190]  So at this point Marlboro has to catch up to Dixie.
[16:52.990 --> 16:54.110]  That's just the reality.
[16:54.110 --> 16:58.450]  There are some pharma companies in great Britain that are light years ahead of
[16:58.450 --> 16:59.470]  the rest of the industry,
[16:59.470 --> 17:04.270]  but that's because great Britain has much better research rules than we do.
[17:04.510 --> 17:08.830]  So back in the day, uh, I used to see on like Facebook and shit,
[17:08.850 --> 17:13.210]  I used to see pictures of Marlboro having weed packages already made.
[17:13.210 --> 17:15.130]  Was that real? Do you think, or is that with just some stuff?
[17:15.770 --> 17:17.170]  It's just a Photoshop mock-up.
[17:17.170 --> 17:22.170]  There was a company out of Colorado that was attempting to put together a pack of
[17:22.450 --> 17:25.690]  cigarettes filled with cannabis. Um,
[17:25.810 --> 17:29.010]  I believe they were to the marketing to dispensary stage.
[17:29.010 --> 17:31.250]  The last time I heard about them, I don't know if they're,
[17:32.010 --> 17:34.810]  if they were to go fund me stage and the guy was over pitching it at the
[17:34.810 --> 17:37.850]  restaurant or what, but I've heard they're on the market.
[17:37.850 --> 17:41.310]  I don't go to shops enough to now, right? Yeah. I don't, uh,
[17:41.830 --> 17:43.870]  I guess I do go to a shop often cause that working one,
[17:43.870 --> 17:45.350]  but I don't pay attention to the products.
[17:45.630 --> 17:48.150]  I didn't see any green and healthy wellness. I'll tell you that much.
[17:49.630 --> 17:52.490]  All right. Let's uh, let's jump out of this one.
[17:52.790 --> 17:55.790]  Big up to cannabinoids and fuck you cancer.
[17:55.830 --> 18:00.550]  That's why I want to wrap up that article. Yeah. Shout out to cannabinoids. Um,
[18:00.550 --> 18:02.550]  where's another one? So there's another article.
[18:02.570 --> 18:06.750]  This one is from the cannabis and of course it is written by our good friend,
[18:06.750 --> 18:09.090]  Ricardo Baca. Uh,
[18:09.530 --> 18:12.050]  this article kind of sparked some controversy and we'll get into the
[18:12.050 --> 18:14.850]  controversy right after the headline is,
[18:14.850 --> 18:19.690]  is this central Denver's first four 20 friendly hotel sub headline is
[18:19.710 --> 18:23.610]  smoke, vape and edibles on the balcony. It's all good at native hotel,
[18:23.650 --> 18:28.050]  Denver's a downtown Denver's first outwardly four 20 friendly hotel.
[18:29.090 --> 18:32.530]  And it says many in Colorado's bustling cannabis industry have complained about
[18:32.530 --> 18:35.290]  the lack of marijuana friendly hotels in this state and others.
[18:35.710 --> 18:39.310]  But it's a problem. It is a problem. We can buy cannabis on every corner in
[18:39.310 --> 18:43.390]  Denver. Uh, if you drive down federal, if you drive down Broadway, um,
[18:43.470 --> 18:46.430]  if you go down Colorado Boulevard, it's, I mean,
[18:46.430 --> 18:51.190]  in some areas it's more than every corner. Yeah, very true. It's a shout out.
[18:51.190 --> 18:55.310]  Green mile. Yeah. Little, little, uh, broadster damn there.
[18:55.570 --> 19:00.150]  It's like a Starbucks and then a car dealership and then a fucking, uh,
[19:00.190 --> 19:02.750]  dispensary. And then what else is there up there in Denver?
[19:02.770 --> 19:05.850]  A little art studio. Yeah. A little art studio or something. But yeah,
[19:05.850 --> 19:07.730]  it's all a tattoo shop. That's what I was going to say.
[19:07.730 --> 19:09.850]  It was what was on my brain at fucking tattoo store.
[19:11.090 --> 19:13.310]  There are all these places to buy cannabis,
[19:13.370 --> 19:18.050]  but the only place to smoke it legally is at your house. Take it home.
[19:18.110 --> 19:22.690]  And if you just drove from Texas, you, you ain't got no home.
[19:23.450 --> 19:27.570]  And imagine having, uh, you just drove how many hours from Texas, whatever.
[19:27.610 --> 19:31.770]  10, 12 hours you get here. It's hot. You hit the dispensary,
[19:31.770 --> 19:34.770]  your mind's blown. You get out to the parking lot and.
[19:35.550 --> 19:38.950]  You're not going to wait 10 to 14 hours to drive home and smoke that first.
[19:39.630 --> 19:43.230]  That's a different special crime. Yeah. You can't even do that. Right.
[19:43.230 --> 19:46.350]  So you go, you've got to find accommodations. And I mean,
[19:46.350 --> 19:51.150]  how many Airbnb places are in Pueblo? Yeah. I mean,
[19:51.190 --> 19:55.710]  you're, you're screwed. We, you need a place to stay. This is a big,
[19:55.910 --> 19:59.470]  this is a need that needs filling people. Right. So the, uh,
[19:59.470 --> 20:00.450]  the next line here says,
[20:00.450 --> 20:03.650]  but Keef Cola partner Richmond Meyer is actually doing something about it.
[20:03.890 --> 20:07.050]  He's opening native hotel this week in downtown Denver,
[20:07.250 --> 20:11.850]  boasting that half of its 16 rooms have weed friendly balconies.
[20:12.610 --> 20:15.530]  And if you do it right, every hotel has a weed friendly balcony.
[20:15.570 --> 20:20.010]  So here's my issue with the balcony. So you're a tourist, you're new.
[20:21.210 --> 20:26.010]  We're going to stick you on the balcony and give you crazy good weed at altitude.
[20:26.510 --> 20:28.830]  Good. So we're setting you up for a dive.
[20:28.830 --> 20:32.270]  How many different ways can we set ourselves up for failure in this industry?
[20:32.310 --> 20:35.750]  We like, we can't bank. We're incredibly popular.
[20:35.750 --> 20:38.790]  So we're essentially giant buildings full of weed and money.
[20:39.190 --> 20:43.390]  Like what Jack ass with a big gun and a tiny Dick doesn't want a big building
[20:43.390 --> 20:47.990]  full of weed and money to rob and still somehow like the robbery rates lower than
[20:48.010 --> 20:48.830]  seven 11s.
[20:49.270 --> 20:52.910]  Have you seen the security guards at the spot? True. But they ain't there now.
[20:53.410 --> 20:55.250]  They are. Well, there was a,
[20:55.730 --> 20:59.170]  I saw Mark Emery's post from yesterday on Facebook,
[20:59.210 --> 21:01.370]  one of his friends dispensaries in Vancouver,
[21:01.370 --> 21:03.250]  somebody drove a truck through the front of it.
[21:03.810 --> 21:07.810]  They apprehended the guy in a different dispensary doing the same shit a second
[21:07.810 --> 21:11.370]  time in a night. Dan. Um, yeah. What a, uh,
[21:11.570 --> 21:16.490]  what a fun place Vancouver must be. But, but I mean,
[21:16.490 --> 21:18.850]  how many different ways we can, can we set ourselves up for failure?
[21:18.870 --> 21:23.070]  Like the last thing you want is a newbie from Texas on edibles on a balcony.
[21:23.110 --> 21:26.230]  That's very true. My high ass on a balcony.
[21:26.230 --> 21:28.310]  I'm going to drop the pipe right off that son of a bitch.
[21:28.350 --> 21:31.670]  Right? Heads up brother ship coming down. People.
[21:31.750 --> 21:34.430]  One year we were at a hotel. I'm not going to say the name of the hotel,
[21:34.430 --> 21:37.150]  but it's a popular hotel in Denver. Uh, here's a dab or go for it.
[21:38.670 --> 21:41.350]  And we had all the rooms full in one area.
[21:42.190 --> 21:47.190]  Like this whole hallway was all dab kids from the cannabis industry and upstairs
[21:47.370 --> 21:49.770]  was all dab kids. And somebody was like, Hey bro,
[21:49.770 --> 21:53.770]  you got any butane and nobody answered. And one guy up above goes,
[21:53.770 --> 21:57.090]  I got a can bro. And the guy goes, drop it down.
[21:57.990 --> 21:59.010]  And everybody got quiet.
[22:01.690 --> 22:05.410]  You see two arms go over the balcony and he goes scoot over and the guy scooted
[22:05.410 --> 22:09.690]  over and he dropped the can of butane and that landed right in the dude below
[22:09.690 --> 22:13.410]  him, his hand below his hand. It was great. That was awesome. So yeah,
[22:13.490 --> 22:14.370]  that's a random bout,
[22:14.390 --> 22:18.110]  but most of these Texas stoners or Nebraska stoners that just took their first
[22:18.110 --> 22:21.190]  dab in a hotel are not going to be able to catch or deal with the balcony.
[22:21.190 --> 22:22.030]  You might be right.
[22:22.190 --> 22:26.270]  No, it's ground level. Yeah. They're fucking, they don't even need stairs.
[22:26.510 --> 22:27.330]  Yeah. Like,
[22:27.330 --> 22:32.330]  but the need for consumption clubs and cannabis friendly hotel accommodations is
[22:32.410 --> 22:33.390]  massive here.
[22:33.630 --> 22:36.030]  And we're going to jump out of the article and just kind of rant on that.
[22:36.110 --> 22:38.390]  That's where I was headed with this. Um, so we can have a,
[22:38.390 --> 22:40.110]  and I'm not trying to bash on the hotel here.
[22:40.110 --> 22:42.310]  I sound like I'm snitching on the hotel and talking shit,
[22:42.770 --> 22:46.490]  but why can we have a cannabis friendly hotel? But we cannot,
[22:46.690 --> 22:50.730]  you're fighting with that. Mike dab rig email combos. So hard to do it.
[22:50.770 --> 22:52.570]  You're going to be a champ. You're going to get an award.
[22:52.570 --> 22:56.410]  Burn my face so hard. All right, so we can have this hotel,
[22:56.410 --> 22:59.490]  but we cannot have the smokers clubs that were in Denver.
[22:59.490 --> 23:01.370]  POTUS got in trouble. Uh,
[23:01.410 --> 23:04.210]  POTUS was where everybody used to be able to go and dab.
[23:04.210 --> 23:07.410]  There was another speakeasy that I recently went to and spoke of.
[23:07.410 --> 23:10.170]  They recently got told that they couldn't smoke in there anymore or they would
[23:10.170 --> 23:15.310]  be dealt with. Uh, the grassroots break room got shut down.
[23:15.510 --> 23:18.110]  So all of the smoking clubs, Mike's telling me to kill his Mike,
[23:18.110 --> 23:20.390]  cause he's going to cough. There you go. You're good, bro. Cough it out.
[23:20.590 --> 23:23.230]  All these smoking. Oh, and it got the echo reduced.
[23:23.670 --> 23:27.390]  All these smoking clubs have been shut down, but we can have a hotel.
[23:27.710 --> 23:30.430]  So that doesn't make sense to me.
[23:30.430 --> 23:32.750]  Mike has given me a thumbs up that I can put his mic back on.
[23:33.110 --> 23:37.430]  A recovered ish. Nice. Uh, you should see the size dab. Mike size dabs.
[23:37.450 --> 23:39.130]  Mike takes, they're super tiny.
[23:39.210 --> 23:42.650]  They're dabs for ants and he chokes like a tobacco kill. Yeah.
[23:42.650 --> 23:45.490]  You guys quit smoking tobacco. Get healthy. Dude, run some laps,
[23:45.490 --> 23:48.770]  spit that shit out and get off the tobacco. You're getting too old for this.
[23:48.810 --> 23:53.090]  Tobacco kill. Yeah. It's going to kill you. You got some reasons to live now.
[23:53.130 --> 23:56.130]  It's time to quit smoking. Yep. All right. So, uh,
[23:56.130 --> 24:00.210]  while some downtown Denver hotels quietly allow marijuana friendly tours, uh,
[24:00.210 --> 24:02.330]  tour operators to book vape friendly rooms,
[24:02.330 --> 24:05.450]  native will be central Denver's first outwardly friendly hotel.
[24:05.710 --> 24:09.070]  The charm of native hotel is that the owners are in the business said Meyer,
[24:09.270 --> 24:12.990]  who is an owner, partner, and investor in a number of cannabis related ventures.
[24:13.310 --> 24:16.670]  We embrace, see, they got sick of answering the question, right? With,
[24:16.710 --> 24:19.830]  we don't know. We don't have an answer. Good luck finding it. Yep.
[24:20.270 --> 24:23.430]  Here's my other business card. There's a way better answer.
[24:24.950 --> 24:26.910]  Yeah. Flip it over. It tells you what else I do.
[24:27.230 --> 24:29.470]  I've got a hotel right over here, man.
[24:29.830 --> 24:32.510]  So we could pretty much just go rent the hotel for the day. You know,
[24:32.510 --> 24:33.830]  you got to pay for the whole night and shit,
[24:33.890 --> 24:35.610]  but they'd just be a spot to go chill and dab.
[24:35.890 --> 24:38.010]  That's a little expensive unless you're doing it right.
[24:38.010 --> 24:41.330]  I have a ballroom. I hope they got plenty of ballroom.
[24:43.130 --> 24:47.050]  All right. Bad rust. We embrace the culture. We embrace the industry.
[24:47.050 --> 24:51.090]  We embrace the plant and everything that's coming along with it. A native hotel,
[24:51.090 --> 24:55.650]  opening in the former jet hotel space at 1612 Wazee street in Denver's Loto
[24:55.650 --> 24:58.410]  neighborhood will hardly be a weed free for all,
[24:58.450 --> 25:01.250]  but half of its rooms will have cannabis friendly balconies.
[25:01.630 --> 25:03.790]  No smoking inside please.
[25:04.070 --> 25:08.110]  And it's CanBria Cafe will serve coffee infused with imported
[25:08.430 --> 25:10.250]  cannabidiol or CBD.
[25:10.550 --> 25:15.150]  So you have your terpenes and your CBD and it's getting infused in 10 milligram
[25:15.150 --> 25:18.070]  dosages into four of our coffees said Meyer.
[25:18.390 --> 25:21.830]  My partner has concocted different elixirs for different situations like
[25:21.830 --> 25:22.950]  hangover drinks.
[25:23.790 --> 25:26.870]  Yeah. That's that hemp juice they sell on the net.
[25:27.670 --> 25:31.030]  Oh, since it's CBD, they can sell it, right? Since it's not THC,
[25:31.030 --> 25:33.290]  it qualifies as hemp. Is that how they're getting away with it?
[25:33.450 --> 25:37.290]  Yeah. You're allowed to grow hemp in most industrialized nations and they've
[25:37.290 --> 25:40.530]  been squeezing CBD out of it since it hits Sanjay Gupta.
[25:40.530 --> 25:43.850]  Because I was going to complain that didn't Senate bill 1084, uh,
[25:43.890 --> 25:48.170]  shut down the ability to serve a medicated concoction on your premises.
[25:48.410 --> 25:51.290]  Yup. Yeah. But they found a way around it, dude, by.
[25:51.370 --> 25:54.690]  It's not really medicated. It's just have seed juice.
[25:54.810 --> 25:55.650]  All right.
[25:55.810 --> 26:00.410]  So Meyer who owns the four 20 friendly hotel and is a partner at Keef Cola also
[26:00.410 --> 26:04.550]  plays a role in light and licensing company. Can core concepts,
[26:04.730 --> 26:06.030]  extraction equipment, uh,
[26:06.050 --> 26:10.030]  manufacture isolate extraction systems hemp company native hemp Corp and the
[26:10.030 --> 26:14.070]  American trade association for cannabis and hemp regardless of Myers,
[26:14.070 --> 26:18.070]  many industrial hats native will still feel like a standard high end boutique
[26:18.070 --> 26:21.110]  hotel. He said, you know, I didn't hear listed there. What's up?
[26:21.550 --> 26:25.430]  The cannabis shop or a cannabis business. Uh,
[26:25.510 --> 26:29.910]  he's one of the many, many entrepreneurs that have sprung up just outside.
[26:30.670 --> 26:32.510]  To help support our wonderful industry.
[26:33.750 --> 26:36.470]  He had money. That's what he showed up with.
[26:37.190 --> 26:40.510]  And a reason to protect that shit. Uncle Sam won't take your,
[26:40.590 --> 26:44.070]  take your shit for working with us. It will take it. If you are us.
[26:44.830 --> 26:47.350]  That's the truth. Wow. That's a good thing to think about. Yup.
[26:47.430 --> 26:48.990]  They don't want your tax money like that.
[26:49.030 --> 26:53.630]  I have people in my life that have lobbied me to be him rather than to be me
[26:54.030 --> 26:58.190]  extensively for that reason. Yeah. Uh,
[26:58.250 --> 27:01.650]  pretty soon Mike is going to teach you guys how to become a lobbyist or how to
[27:01.670 --> 27:06.410]  get in the ground floor of doing medical marijuana activism or recreational
[27:06.410 --> 27:09.050]  cannabis activism or cannabis legalization activism,
[27:09.050 --> 27:10.190]  whatever you're into where you are.
[27:10.190 --> 27:13.650]  Mike is going to do a little lesson on how to get into that pretty soon for us
[27:13.650 --> 27:16.290]  here. Probably two or three episodes away from that to tell you the truth.
[27:16.610 --> 27:19.810]  This time we get involved people. I'm going to tell you how it's done. Yeah.
[27:19.890 --> 27:22.890]  It's not that much. You guys seem intimidated, but it's not that bad.
[27:23.170 --> 27:24.490]  It's really not that bad.
[27:24.650 --> 27:27.890]  This guy's got this hotel and you can smoke there. And it goes on to say,
[27:27.890 --> 27:31.670]  we're not going to be hanging green crosses everywhere at admire who said he
[27:31.670 --> 27:34.750]  funded native with money he made in the financial industry. Uh,
[27:34.770 --> 27:37.790]  we know that there's this big cannabis tourism movement and we want to be able
[27:37.790 --> 27:41.390]  to embrace it. We have cannabis friendly, friendly rooms because they have
[27:41.390 --> 27:42.230]  balconies.
[27:42.470 --> 27:46.070]  16 just out of curiosity,
[27:46.070 --> 27:49.670]  do you remember the number of people that came in for the cannabis cup?
[27:49.990 --> 27:51.990]  Um, a lot more than 16.
[27:52.870 --> 27:56.150]  Right. All right. So when this thing works,
[27:56.170 --> 28:01.050]  we need about 3,500 other people to do the same. Yes. Yes. In Lodo.
[28:02.970 --> 28:04.250]  No, all over Colorado.
[28:04.490 --> 28:08.290]  True. But I mean just for the cannabis cup, like, come on,
[28:08.290 --> 28:12.530]  we need one out in Pueblo West right away. We need a, we need a cannabis Marriott.
[28:12.570 --> 28:15.690]  There's a hotel in Manitou Springs that claims to be four 20 friendly.
[28:15.770 --> 28:17.450]  They have a four 20 friendly on the side,
[28:17.850 --> 28:22.010]  but this is the first one in Denver is the only reason it's really special.
[28:22.130 --> 28:25.490]  The one in Manitou, it's not, you can't smoke in the room.
[28:25.510 --> 28:28.990]  They have a smoking tent and then they have a sub smoking tent.
[28:29.310 --> 28:33.030]  Like they have the cigarette tent and then right next to it is the cannabis tint
[28:33.030 --> 28:36.430]  with like chairs and shit in there. So it is four 20 friendly in there,
[28:36.670 --> 28:39.270]  but you can't smoke out and dab out in the room. And what's the point?
[28:39.290 --> 28:42.030]  I want to lay in the bed and watch cartoons. Right?
[28:42.030 --> 28:45.950]  I've smoked weed in plenty of hotel parking lots. Why is this one special?
[28:46.830 --> 28:47.190]  All right.
[28:47.190 --> 28:50.430]  So Meyer said he's been kicked out of hotels in Denver for smoking cannabis
[28:50.430 --> 28:54.150]  inside of his room. Uh, other hotels will find you crazy amounts and kick you out.
[28:54.150 --> 28:57.050]  He said, I've been kicked out at a hotel in Denver for smoking cannabis.
[28:57.330 --> 29:00.130]  It was a mid tier, smaller hotel and it was a few years back,
[29:00.370 --> 29:04.650]  but that's the kind of stuff I don't want to happen in our hotel. Uh,
[29:04.690 --> 29:08.930]  Meyer said he's working on some affinity partnerships with local recreational pot
[29:08.950 --> 29:10.570]  shops and other related businesses.
[29:10.930 --> 29:14.450]  Show your native hotel room key and get a discount. Um,
[29:14.770 --> 29:18.170]  then it says pro tip recreational shop Lotto wellness is right across the
[29:18.190 --> 29:21.370]  street. Yeah, that's cute. Uh, as for stocking his rooms,
[29:21.370 --> 29:25.870]  he's got mini bars with branded rolling papers, glass pipes, and other stuff.
[29:26.870 --> 29:30.950]  His team aren't quite there yet. It's not the word. Uh, yeah, I'm guessing.
[29:30.970 --> 29:34.950]  A couch remints. I've never seen that word in my life. That's a new word.
[29:35.110 --> 29:39.710]  A Kutcher remints. It's a good word to learn now. Uh,
[29:39.730 --> 29:41.770]  we want to double and triple check everything.
[29:41.770 --> 29:44.590]  So we're not putting our business at risk. Meyer said, it's a hotel,
[29:44.630 --> 29:48.750]  a club and a restaurant. And we have a lot of alcohol related point of sales.
[29:48.750 --> 29:51.890]  So we're keeping the cannabis to the rooms. Yeah.
[29:51.890 --> 29:52.890]  That's a big thing to think about.
[29:52.890 --> 29:55.250]  They're going to have to keep the cannabis and the alcohol separate because the
[29:55.250 --> 29:57.570]  alcohol, they're not allowed to let you gather.
[29:58.830 --> 30:02.330]  It's a really bizarre part of the law right now.
[30:02.330 --> 30:07.090]  Most places don't allow any sort of gathering to
[30:07.090 --> 30:11.730]  consume cannabis. They get all kinds of touchy. It has to be private,
[30:11.730 --> 30:16.290]  invite only, um, private property, close to the public,
[30:16.310 --> 30:20.790]  like secured security. I mean, it's just obnoxious.
[30:21.150 --> 30:24.430]  All this shit, the symphony had to go through just so that people could get
[30:24.430 --> 30:26.150]  baked and then go listen to the symphony.
[30:26.510 --> 30:28.070]  And then they tried to shut that down.
[30:28.550 --> 30:32.590]  Tried hard. Um, they really set the path for the, the,
[30:32.710 --> 30:36.150]  the rules for doing this, which is kind of awesome way to go Colorado symphony.
[30:36.950 --> 30:39.830]  Um, who, yeah, who thought they were going to be the trailblazer,
[30:39.830 --> 30:40.670]  but they stepped up.
[30:40.950 --> 30:43.030]  Right. So that's enough news. You guys, Mike,
[30:43.030 --> 30:44.670]  thanks for coming and doing another new show with me.
[30:45.130 --> 30:47.090]  Thanks man. These are awesome. Keep them coming.
[30:47.330 --> 30:51.330]  Start putting together your little episode about how to get these people into
[30:51.330 --> 30:52.290]  cannabis activism.
[30:52.290 --> 30:55.370]  I'm sure there are a few people that are out there listening right now that want
[30:55.370 --> 30:57.570]  to be a cannabis activist and they don't know how to do it.
[30:57.570 --> 31:01.130]  So start writing that. Just give me like 15 or 20 minutes. We got it, buddy.
[31:01.210 --> 31:03.770]  Cool. We'll do that. So you heard him. He just gave us his word. You guys,
[31:03.770 --> 31:06.450]  he's going to do that for us. We're going to do it. All right.
[31:06.610 --> 31:09.250]  Time to start thinking about what you can do for cannabis.
[31:09.370 --> 31:11.490]  That's right. So this show is going to come out on a Wednesday.
[31:11.510 --> 31:15.630]  I will be back on Monday with another episode. Um, coming up,
[31:15.630 --> 31:18.070]  I don't know that it'll be the next episode, but coming up pretty soon,
[31:18.070 --> 31:21.510]  we will do an episode about Fino hunting and mother plants,
[31:21.630 --> 31:22.990]  how to take care of your mother plants,
[31:22.990 --> 31:25.310]  how to select a good mother plant from the Fino hunt.
[31:25.750 --> 31:27.150]  I think we've done a little bit of it,
[31:27.150 --> 31:29.270]  but I'm going to do a nice focused episode on that.
[31:29.630 --> 31:33.510]  Uh, Mike's going to do his show about, um,
[31:33.750 --> 31:36.430]  getting us into politics. Yeah. What's getting involved.
[31:36.430 --> 31:37.350]  That's what it'll be called.
[31:37.430 --> 31:41.030]  It's not so much getting you into politics or getting you into lobby.
[31:41.050 --> 31:44.690]  And it's just, you got to get involved. If you don't get involved now,
[31:44.730 --> 31:47.410]  we're going to be stuck in the same dimerish loop forever.
[31:47.610 --> 31:50.570]  They're going to make stupid rules around us that we didn't even pay attention
[31:50.570 --> 31:53.890]  to them making, and they're going to pass it because nobody knew. Yeah.
[31:53.930 --> 31:54.370]  And then you're going to,
[31:54.370 --> 31:57.530]  your whole country is going to be stuck with fucking CBD only medicine.
[31:57.730 --> 32:00.770]  Cause we weren't paying attention. Yep. Yeah. We don't need that to happen.
[32:00.810 --> 32:02.930]  One of the big anti-pot groups, uh,
[32:02.970 --> 32:07.310]  going around the country right now is now lobbying for CBD only
[32:07.330 --> 32:11.370]  nationally. Uh, because if that rule goes in federally,
[32:11.370 --> 32:16.050]  they get to their perfect excuse for stamping out all of the medical access
[32:16.050 --> 32:20.330]  we've created since 96, they get to say again, well,
[32:20.330 --> 32:21.610]  the feds are allowing it.
[32:22.010 --> 32:26.250]  Nobody else gets to have it except through a B and C and they get to shut down
[32:26.250 --> 32:30.210]  everything coast to coast. Like it's all the excuse they need.
[32:30.210 --> 32:32.250]  They did it once already in the eighties.
[32:34.090 --> 32:36.970]  I fear that that sounds terrible. We'll talk more about that on a future,
[32:36.990 --> 32:39.190]  on the episode. When you tell us how to get involved,
[32:39.270 --> 32:42.270]  we'll talk about that in depth. Get involved folks. All right, guys,
[32:42.270 --> 32:44.470]  I'll be back Monday with, with another full on episode,
[32:44.470 --> 32:47.670]  probably something more in depth, more, uh, more less than any less newsy,
[32:47.990 --> 32:49.230]  probably be just myself.
[32:49.270 --> 32:52.590]  I'm going to try to get King Cola and maybe Jesse back over for some more shows.
[32:53.190 --> 32:55.070]  Those boys are busy. It's outdoor season.
[32:55.070 --> 32:58.430]  So Jesse is kicking it with the outdoor grows. Yeah.
[32:58.430 --> 33:01.190]  There'll be back on the podcast sometime after Christmas. Y'all.
[33:01.270 --> 33:03.910]  Oh, we got to get them over here and do some outdoor growing episodes.
[33:03.930 --> 33:06.570]  Sean agreed to come. Uh, the Rocky mountain worm company,
[33:07.450 --> 33:10.250]  is going to, uh, maybe jump back on sponsorship.
[33:10.250 --> 33:12.050]  And if not the Rocky mountain worm company,
[33:12.050 --> 33:14.930]  it will be Rocky mountain organic farming, which is Sean's company.
[33:14.970 --> 33:18.210]  And he will come do a lot of speaking once he becomes an official sponsor of the
[33:18.210 --> 33:22.250]  show. All right. So, uh, thank you guys for listening again.
[33:22.250 --> 33:24.930]  If you were interested in sponsoring the podcast or if you have a product you'd
[33:24.930 --> 33:27.810]  like me to review, send me an email. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[33:27.810 --> 33:30.930]  I'll get you all the information you need. Mike and I would have a lot of fun,
[33:30.950 --> 33:33.750]  sitting here, uh, testing out whatever product you sent us.
[33:34.550 --> 33:36.190]  We need some stuff to product test. Y'all.
[33:36.550 --> 33:39.150]  What was that nail we were checking out that a friend of ours had?
[33:39.510 --> 33:41.550]  What was the name of that? Uh, was it the torchless?
[33:42.510 --> 33:46.770]  I think it was called the torchless. I want to review one of those. Um, Tim,
[33:46.770 --> 33:49.590]  if you're listening to the show, bro, sometimes you listen, uh,
[33:49.590 --> 33:54.590]  I would like you to send me a torchless nail to review on the show and,
[33:54.910 --> 33:57.190]  uh, we will review it. Torchless nail.
[33:57.230 --> 33:59.190]  And then maybe you can become a sponsor or something.
[33:59.210 --> 34:02.010]  And that's how we'll pay for the nail if we like it. And if we don't like it,
[34:02.090 --> 34:06.730]  I will send it right back to you. Um, yeah. What else do we need as a sponsor?
[34:07.730 --> 34:11.250]  Oh, the Pella nails. The guys that make the cases with the email built into the
[34:11.250 --> 34:14.290]  case. Yeah, we need those. We want to test out one of those.
[34:14.410 --> 34:17.250]  Dabidu. The Dabidu. I'm not sure what the Dabidu is.
[34:17.490 --> 34:20.970]  Uh, another electronic nail company I haven't seen online. Okay, nice.
[34:21.010 --> 34:24.730]  Lots of good social media stuff from them. Yeah. Or stuff that's got my eye.
[34:24.990 --> 34:28.990]  Uh, the show is reached by over 10,000 people on every episode within the first
[34:28.990 --> 34:30.910]  24 hours of being posted.
[34:31.110 --> 34:34.990]  I'm sure there's some local glass blowers that, uh, could use a little prop.
[34:35.670 --> 34:37.830]  Nice. All right, you guys, if you want to sponsor the show, let me know.
[34:37.850 --> 34:41.550]  If you'd like to be advertised on a podcast that reaches 10,000 pot smokers
[34:41.550 --> 34:45.030]  within 24 hours, let me know. We'll hook you up. Uh,
[34:45.030 --> 34:47.830]  it's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com. So now that the show's over guys,
[34:47.830 --> 34:49.710]  make sure you go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[34:49.710 --> 34:52.190]  search for a girl from your heart. Uh, find the review section.
[34:52.190 --> 34:56.970]  Give me a five star rating, please. Come on. Yeah, just do it. Come on.
[34:57.410 --> 35:01.490]  I'm Jedi mind tricking you right now. You hear it? Yeah. All right.
[35:01.490 --> 35:03.330]  So after you give me five stars, type in a little comment,
[35:03.330 --> 35:06.490]  let me know what you think of the show and I will read your comment on a future
[35:06.490 --> 35:09.490]  episode. I'm just going to read it. I will say I'll read.
[35:09.490 --> 35:11.810]  I've read every comment that's on iTunes. I've read them all.
[35:12.090 --> 35:15.810]  Stitcher completely sucks for comments. It's hard to find the comments. Uh,
[35:15.850 --> 35:18.610]  sometimes it's hard to leave a comment. They change Stitcher constantly.
[35:19.010 --> 35:21.450]  If you can leave a comment on there, go for it. Uh,
[35:21.450 --> 35:25.830]  you can always leave some comments on Facebook. You can leave a little comments.
[35:25.830 --> 35:29.110]  You only get 140 characters, but you can hit me up on Twitter. Uh,
[35:29.110 --> 35:31.070]  if you have something to say, but you're not into the social media thing,
[35:31.070 --> 35:33.310]  definitely email me. It's growfromyourhearthotmail.com.
[35:33.590 --> 35:36.230]  Don't forget that every show is available or, uh, yeah,
[35:36.230 --> 35:37.750]  every show is available on iTunes, Stitcher,
[35:37.750 --> 35:41.910]  and all the episodes are forever archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com.

[35:58.570 --> 36:01.850]  I would appreciate it. Uh, Ron, all the social media sites, like I said, Hey,
[36:01.850 --> 36:03.770]  Mike, how can these guys find you on social media?

[36:11.010 --> 36:13.210]  He contributes to the show quite a bit. Thanks for that.
[36:13.250 --> 36:15.810]  Let me know what type of news you want me to send, uh,
[36:15.890 --> 36:17.770]  Jeff's way and we'll talk about it on the show.
[36:17.790 --> 36:19.750]  Or send some news to Mike. Mike will proofread it.
[36:20.350 --> 36:23.230]  And if it qualifies for the show, he will forward it right my way.
[36:23.470 --> 36:28.150]  You guys can just send it right to me at GFYH podcast on Twitter. So, uh,
[36:28.270 --> 36:30.510]  yeah, make sure you guys follow iRegenetics on Instagram.

[36:37.910 --> 36:40.030]  car's busted, but by now, by the time this comes out,
[36:40.030 --> 36:43.110]  I'll be driving the car again. Uh, I'm at the spot quite often.
[36:43.110 --> 36:44.270]  We're getting ready to rock.
[36:44.290 --> 36:47.470]  I will be posting more pictures of the spot dispensary as time goes on.

[36:54.930 --> 36:58.090]  Thank you guys for listening until next time. Oh, did I do that? Did I say,
[36:58.090 --> 37:00.970]  shout out to my ninja Spence? We almost fucked that up.
[37:02.890 --> 37:06.130]  Shout out to my ninja Spence. What up brother? Uh,
[37:06.170 --> 37:07.650]  thanks again for listening to you guys until next time.
