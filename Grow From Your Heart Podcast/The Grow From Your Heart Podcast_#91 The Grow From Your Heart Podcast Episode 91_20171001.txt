[00:17.980 --> 00:20.700]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.700 --> 00:22.280]  It's time for episode number 91
[00:22.280 --> 00:24.000]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.800]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.800 --> 00:28.880]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.880 --> 00:30.160]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.160 --> 00:32.480]  if you're a news smoker or a hardcore dabber,
[00:32.480 --> 00:33.800]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:33.800 --> 00:35.040]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:35.040 --> 00:36.720]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.720 --> 00:39.500]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.500 --> 00:40.960]  I'm your host, they call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.960 --> 00:42.440]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:42.440 --> 00:44.000]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.000 --> 00:45.080]  to the Mystic Roots Band
[00:45.080 --> 00:46.880]  for letting me play their music on my podcast.
[00:46.880 --> 00:50.840]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:50.840 --> 00:52.360]  You guys, I don't have any commercials for this week.
[00:52.360 --> 00:54.200]  I wanna get right into the episode.
[00:54.200 --> 00:55.360]  Before we get started, I wanna let you know
[00:55.360 --> 00:57.120]  that this is a part two episode.
[00:57.120 --> 00:58.280]  A few days ago, Jesse was here
[00:58.280 --> 01:00.000]  and we recorded for quite a while.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.120]  I put up the first half of the conversation on Monday.
[01:03.120 --> 01:04.600]  This is part two.
[01:04.600 --> 01:05.960]  It starts off with me.
[01:05.960 --> 01:08.000]  I asked Jesse if he had any guidance
[01:08.000 --> 01:09.920]  or advice to give growers.
[01:09.920 --> 01:12.680]  And then we'll just jump into right where he started.
[01:12.680 --> 01:14.760]  Before we get there, I do wanna make an apology.
[01:14.760 --> 01:18.720]  I posted episode 90 to iTunes and my website and Stitcher.
[01:18.720 --> 01:22.960]  And for some reason, episode 90 did not make it to Stitcher
[01:22.960 --> 01:23.960]  like it normally would have.
[01:23.960 --> 01:26.440]  That was not my issue, it was Stitcher's issue.
[01:26.440 --> 01:28.000]  They have since been emailed.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.160]  As soon as Stitcher gets episode 90 up,
[01:30.160 --> 01:31.920]  I will post episode 91.
[01:31.920 --> 01:34.560]  I don't wanna cause any confusion with Stitcher.
[01:34.560 --> 01:35.800]  I've emailed them and let them know
[01:35.800 --> 01:38.200]  that my latest episode did not post.
[01:38.200 --> 01:39.760]  So I don't wanna add another episode onto that
[01:39.760 --> 01:40.840]  and confuse them.
[01:40.840 --> 01:42.960]  As soon as Stitcher gets episode 90 out,
[01:42.960 --> 01:45.520]  episode 91 will be posted right after that.
[01:45.520 --> 01:46.800]  I appreciate you guys for being patient.
[01:46.800 --> 01:50.160]  I do apologize for any inconvenience that may have caused.
[01:50.160 --> 01:51.200]  I feel like I've been rambling enough.
[01:51.200 --> 01:52.200]  It's almost a two minute intro.
[01:52.200 --> 01:53.520]  Let's get right down to the part
[01:53.520 --> 01:54.920]  where Jesse and I are talking.
[01:54.920 --> 01:55.760]  So here we go.
[01:55.760 --> 01:57.440]  I asked Jesse, I basically said,
[01:57.440 --> 01:59.840]  do you have any guidance that you would like to share
[01:59.840 --> 02:01.160]  with our listeners?
[02:01.160 --> 02:04.360]  And then here is what Jesse had to say.
[02:04.360 --> 02:06.120]  Don't sell junk clones.
[02:06.120 --> 02:07.240]  Don't sell junk clones.
[02:07.240 --> 02:09.280]  Don't sell untested seeds.
[02:09.280 --> 02:10.680]  Oh my God.
[02:10.720 --> 02:14.480]  I don't sell clones of plants from seed
[02:14.480 --> 02:16.000]  that you haven't even flowered yet.
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.320]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:17.320 --> 02:20.160]  I've heard so many horror stories at the growth store.
[02:20.160 --> 02:21.960]  I feel so bad for people.
[02:21.960 --> 02:22.880]  I can't help them.
[02:22.880 --> 02:25.880]  But it just really sucks.
[02:25.880 --> 02:27.640]  If you do that stuff, do it right.
[02:27.640 --> 02:31.060]  If you get a bag seed out of, what's this hash?
[02:31.060 --> 02:31.900]  This is Stardog.
[02:31.900 --> 02:33.440]  I'm taking a dab of Stardog from her bags.
[02:33.440 --> 02:34.280]  Just give it to me.
[02:34.280 --> 02:35.100]  Her bags.
[02:35.100 --> 02:38.760]  If you, what was I even gonna say now?
[02:38.760 --> 02:40.080]  If you get a bag seed of it.
[02:40.600 --> 02:41.600]  And you grow it out.
[02:41.600 --> 02:44.800]  And then, oh, if you grow some weed
[02:44.800 --> 02:46.440]  and it's got a bunch of seeds in it,
[02:46.440 --> 02:49.800]  that Stardog plant, just because it's wholly seeded to fuck
[02:49.800 --> 02:52.200]  doesn't mean you can call those seeds Stardog.
[02:52.200 --> 02:54.240]  Those are not Stardog seeds.
[02:54.240 --> 02:55.080]  No, not at all.
[02:55.080 --> 02:56.320]  Those are unknown seeds.
[02:56.320 --> 03:01.320]  Unless you hit that Stardog girl with male Stardog pollen
[03:01.720 --> 03:04.560]  or manipulated the plant in some other fashion
[03:04.560 --> 03:07.480]  to create those S1 seeds.
[03:07.480 --> 03:08.960]  It does happen.
[03:09.920 --> 03:10.760]  But if you don't know.
[03:10.760 --> 03:12.000]  It's still not exactly it.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.480]  Right, but my thing is if you don't know what did it,
[03:15.480 --> 03:17.280]  don't call it Stardog.
[03:17.280 --> 03:18.360]  Because it could be,
[03:18.360 --> 03:19.680]  there could have been some pollen in there.
[03:19.680 --> 03:20.920]  It could have been another one of the plants
[03:20.920 --> 03:21.920]  that hermed on it.
[03:21.920 --> 03:23.800]  It could have been a male in there.
[03:23.800 --> 03:26.480]  If all you had was seven Stardog plants in there,
[03:26.480 --> 03:28.160]  I guess you do have Stardog seeds.
[03:28.160 --> 03:30.560]  If you light stressed it and it produced a bunch of seeds,
[03:30.560 --> 03:32.360]  you do now have Stardog seed.
[03:32.360 --> 03:37.360]  It could have been a really special recessive
[03:37.520 --> 03:41.200]  clone phenotype and what comes out
[03:41.200 --> 03:43.000]  is the dominant piece of junk.
[03:45.320 --> 03:48.160]  You're gonna see grandpa when you grow up.
[03:48.160 --> 03:49.360]  You're gonna see what the grandpa was.
[03:49.360 --> 03:50.720]  You're gonna see what grandma was.
[03:50.720 --> 03:53.640]  And sometimes those plants were shitty or something.
[03:53.640 --> 03:54.680]  You just never know.
[03:54.680 --> 03:56.480]  A lot of what we have now,
[03:56.480 --> 03:58.320]  the plants that we're growing now
[03:58.320 --> 04:00.600]  are like your dad's fault.
[04:00.600 --> 04:01.640]  You know what I mean?
[04:01.640 --> 04:03.680]  Jesse's dad is an old time grower.
[04:03.680 --> 04:07.040]  Yeah, they're the ones who chose some of the genetics.
[04:07.840 --> 04:10.040]  He actually did some breeding back then.
[04:10.040 --> 04:12.240]  They had to steal street lights
[04:12.240 --> 04:14.960]  and they had to use shitty soil and they had to hide.
[04:14.960 --> 04:16.680]  They couldn't run too much electricity.
[04:16.680 --> 04:18.360]  They didn't know what the hell they were looking for.
[04:18.360 --> 04:19.960]  They had the shittiest books.
[04:19.960 --> 04:22.600]  Everything in the books back then was hand drawn.
[04:22.600 --> 04:27.600]  People were still, they were stealing electricity back then.
[04:27.600 --> 04:30.120]  Hand drawn books that you had to go
[04:30.120 --> 04:32.080]  to shady ass head shops to buy.
[04:32.080 --> 04:33.280]  Shout out to Mel Frank.
[04:34.720 --> 04:35.880]  All right, I'm gonna take this dab here
[04:35.880 --> 04:36.720]  and then we'll start doing this.
[04:37.480 --> 04:39.360]  That generation is responsible
[04:39.360 --> 04:40.640]  for the plants that we have now.
[04:40.640 --> 04:43.040]  Those guys, some of the guys that went to war
[04:43.040 --> 04:45.520]  in other countries brought back seeds from those regions.
[04:45.520 --> 04:46.440]  They grew those seeds.
[04:46.440 --> 04:48.080]  They found that some were too damn tall.
[04:48.080 --> 04:50.320]  They found that some took way too long.
[04:50.320 --> 04:51.680]  And they got rid of them.
[04:51.680 --> 04:54.480]  And I bet you, bro, I bet now that we've got room
[04:54.480 --> 04:56.580]  and space and lights and technology,
[04:56.580 --> 04:59.120]  I bet some of the gold was thrown the fuck away.
[04:59.120 --> 05:01.280]  Oh, I guarantee.
[05:01.280 --> 05:03.280]  If you've got a bag of old school seeds,
[05:03.280 --> 05:05.760]  if you're like 50 or 60 years old
[05:05.760 --> 05:07.760]  and you've got a big sandwich bag full of seeds
[05:07.760 --> 05:09.800]  that you had when you were, let's see,
[05:09.800 --> 05:11.600]  I wanna go back to the 70s.
[05:11.600 --> 05:14.640]  So if you got some 35 year old seeds,
[05:14.640 --> 05:17.580]  40 year old seeds and you wanna share them,
[05:17.580 --> 05:20.440]  send Jesse and I a sandwich baggie full.
[05:20.440 --> 05:22.080]  We will grow the shit out of them
[05:22.080 --> 05:24.400]  and we'll take pictures and we'll give you a clone
[05:24.400 --> 05:26.440]  of our favorite shit out of that.
[05:26.440 --> 05:29.200]  I got some pretty old seeds the other day.
[05:29.200 --> 05:34.200]  Shout out to Mr. G and I can't remember his name.
[05:36.360 --> 05:38.960]  Llama Box, Llama Box.
[05:38.960 --> 05:40.720]  Yeah, thanks for the hookup, guys.
[05:40.720 --> 05:42.960]  I've heard of, Llama Box is very familiar.
[05:42.960 --> 05:44.000]  Do I know Llama Box?
[05:44.000 --> 05:44.840]  Yeah.
[05:44.840 --> 05:46.840]  Oh yeah, he won a, yeah,
[05:46.840 --> 05:50.160]  he was one of the winners for the 50 show.
[05:50.160 --> 05:52.320]  That is true and his little Twitter icon
[05:52.320 --> 05:55.120]  is a little llama getting crazy, yeah.
[05:55.120 --> 05:55.940]  I knew I remembered that.
[05:55.940 --> 05:58.820]  I was taking a dab and that still made sense to me.
[05:58.820 --> 06:00.880]  Shout out to Green and Healthy Wellness.
[06:00.880 --> 06:02.040]  While I'm thinking about it, you guys,
[06:02.040 --> 06:03.020]  I wrote down to say this.
[06:03.020 --> 06:04.200]  I was supposed to say it in the intro,
[06:04.200 --> 06:05.440]  but I just took a dab and I wanna make sure
[06:06.160 --> 06:07.000]  I don't forget.
[06:07.000 --> 06:09.360]  Green and Healthy Wellness is not closed forever.
[06:09.360 --> 06:10.200]  No.
[06:10.200 --> 06:11.800]  I know I hyped this shop in Colorado Springs.
[06:11.800 --> 06:13.560]  Shout out to Hunt, shout out to Damsel,
[06:13.560 --> 06:15.840]  shout out to Haley, shout out to Jordan,
[06:15.840 --> 06:18.720]  the Jordans, and John Randalls Jr.
[06:18.720 --> 06:22.000]  But they had to shut their doors for a little while.
[06:22.000 --> 06:23.400]  The building, I don't know how much
[06:23.400 --> 06:24.800]  of this business is mind to air.
[06:24.800 --> 06:26.760]  The building in which they were located was sold
[06:26.760 --> 06:28.760]  and the new owner did not want a dispensary there,
[06:28.760 --> 06:30.160]  is basically the story.
[06:30.160 --> 06:31.520]  So they were forced to move.
[06:31.520 --> 06:33.300]  They do have a new location.
[06:33.300 --> 06:35.200]  By the time you hear this, it is likely
[06:35.960 --> 06:36.800]  that they are open to back for business.
[06:36.800 --> 06:39.000]  And if they are not, trust me, you guys,
[06:39.000 --> 06:39.840]  Green and Healthy Wellness.
[06:39.840 --> 06:41.040]  Working as fast as they can.
[06:41.040 --> 06:43.720]  Dude, I saw them working to tear down the building
[06:43.720 --> 06:46.480]  and it was like army ants and they're just going buck wild.
[06:46.480 --> 06:47.480]  It was crazy.
[06:47.480 --> 06:49.660]  Everybody was sweaty and had this stressful look.
[06:49.660 --> 06:50.500]  So they're getting it going.
[06:50.500 --> 06:51.460]  They moved the grow too?
[06:51.460 --> 06:52.300]  They moved everything, yeah.
[06:52.300 --> 06:53.240]  Oh shit.
[06:53.240 --> 06:54.080]  Yeah, so.
[06:54.080 --> 06:54.900]  That's always fun.
[06:54.900 --> 06:55.740]  Yeah.
[06:55.740 --> 06:57.840]  So they are eager to get the new facility open.
[06:57.840 --> 06:59.080]  They're not gone forever, you guys.
[06:59.080 --> 07:01.080]  The Turpex hookup at Green and Healthy Wellness
[07:01.080 --> 07:02.120]  will be back.
[07:02.120 --> 07:03.480]  Damsel will be back.
[07:03.480 --> 07:04.700]  Hunt will be back.
[07:05.220 --> 07:06.060]  If I understand it right,
[07:06.060 --> 07:07.100]  they actually got a better building, didn't they?
[07:07.100 --> 07:08.380]  They got a better location.
[07:08.380 --> 07:09.220]  Nice.
[07:09.220 --> 07:10.060]  It's a little bigger.
[07:10.060 --> 07:10.880]  That building was a little tight.
[07:10.880 --> 07:13.620]  The parking would get a little cramped in there sometimes.
[07:13.620 --> 07:17.260]  Yeah, so they will be back and it will be better than ever.
[07:17.260 --> 07:19.620]  They do apologize for the inconvenience.
[07:19.620 --> 07:22.380]  We know that a lot of people rely on them for their medicine.
[07:22.380 --> 07:24.400]  They are a medical only shop.
[07:25.340 --> 07:28.220]  So a lot of patients are looking for a new spot for medicine.
[07:28.220 --> 07:29.700]  They'll be back, you guys, I promise.
[07:29.700 --> 07:30.540]  I certainly promise.
[07:30.540 --> 07:31.580]  Big shout out to Hunt.
[07:31.580 --> 07:33.340]  Hunt was here the other day at the house and hung out
[07:33.380 --> 07:36.740]  and we did make promises to record together very soon.
[07:36.740 --> 07:37.580]  Nice.
[07:37.580 --> 07:40.860]  That episode will feature the lovely Duditz Damsel,
[07:40.860 --> 07:41.940]  my favorite suicide girl.
[07:41.940 --> 07:42.780]  So that'll be a good time.
[07:42.780 --> 07:43.620]  Nice, nice.
[07:43.620 --> 07:44.440]  Yeah, well we're gonna-
[07:44.440 --> 07:46.540]  She's a little famous on the interweb.
[07:46.540 --> 07:47.860]  You know, she is a little popular.
[07:47.860 --> 07:49.220]  She gave me a shout out.
[07:49.220 --> 07:51.140]  I sent her a, I took,
[07:51.140 --> 07:52.360]  I'm sure I've talked about her on the show.
[07:52.360 --> 07:54.580]  I'm growing a strain called Damsel's Deng.
[07:54.580 --> 07:56.100]  I'm pheno-hunting from seed.
[07:56.100 --> 07:58.180]  I'm running three different seed lines
[07:58.180 --> 07:59.760]  of stuff that I've crossed
[07:59.760 --> 08:01.900]  and I'm looking to find her favorite phenotype
[08:01.900 --> 08:04.380]  and then we're gonna name that one Damsel's Deng
[08:04.380 --> 08:06.340]  and it's gonna be marketed at the dispensary
[08:06.340 --> 08:09.580]  that I represent and the dispensary that she represents.
[08:09.580 --> 08:11.620]  And so I took a picture of the seedling
[08:11.620 --> 08:14.300]  and sent it to her and I said, the beginning.
[08:14.300 --> 08:16.660]  And she put that on Instagram
[08:16.660 --> 08:19.420]  and within an hour I had 100 new followers.
[08:19.420 --> 08:20.260]  Jesus.
[08:20.260 --> 08:21.080]  Yeah.
[08:21.080 --> 08:22.180]  So shout out to Duditz Damsel.
[08:22.180 --> 08:23.880]  That's my favorite suicide girl.
[08:24.900 --> 08:26.220]  That's hard to pick.
[08:26.220 --> 08:27.900]  Yeah, that'll be, yeah,
[08:27.900 --> 08:29.540]  I bet that'll be a little bit popular.
[08:29.540 --> 08:31.060]  That'll get some stuff going for both of us.
[08:31.060 --> 08:33.140]  Yeah, it'll expose both brands.
[08:33.140 --> 08:36.500]  Yeah, Average Genetics, the Suicide Girls, Duditz Damsel.
[08:37.540 --> 08:38.620]  Hunt will be part of that.
[08:38.620 --> 08:40.460]  The Grammy Gatsby will be part of advertising.
[08:40.460 --> 08:42.420]  Green and Healthy Wellness will be carrying the flowers
[08:42.420 --> 08:43.620]  for sure.
[08:43.620 --> 08:46.020]  In the near future, the Spot will have the flowers.
[08:46.020 --> 08:47.580]  But you guys, this is a year-long project.
[08:47.580 --> 08:49.580]  Don't think this is something that's gonna happen
[08:49.580 --> 08:50.980]  in a few weeks.
[08:50.980 --> 08:53.380]  We bred a seed line.
[08:53.380 --> 08:55.300]  We bred three seed lines.
[08:55.300 --> 08:57.300]  We took those seed lines, they germinated.
[08:57.300 --> 08:58.420]  They are now in veg.
[08:58.420 --> 09:00.860]  They just got put into three gallon pots.
[09:01.620 --> 09:04.340]  I've got to run, I think, 22 of them
[09:04.340 --> 09:06.420]  out of the original, I think, 30 started.
[09:06.420 --> 09:08.500]  22 of them have made it to where I think
[09:08.500 --> 09:09.600]  they'll make it to the flower room.
[09:09.600 --> 09:11.560]  I may take one or two out.
[09:11.560 --> 09:13.320]  One's too tall and lanky.
[09:13.320 --> 09:15.660]  It's a boy, I can tell just by looking.
[09:15.660 --> 09:17.380]  So I kind of want to just pull that one.
[09:17.380 --> 09:18.660]  But then they'll flower.
[09:18.660 --> 09:21.940]  Once they're flowered, there's a private party set up.
[09:21.940 --> 09:22.980]  The date's already been chosen.
[09:22.980 --> 09:24.860]  There's a location being put together.
[09:24.860 --> 09:27.180]  And the Grammy Gatsby is gonna throw a tasting party
[09:27.180 --> 09:30.280]  and there will be scorecards and video done
[09:30.720 --> 09:31.760]  and full on reviews.
[09:31.760 --> 09:33.960]  So yeah, we're taking this one quite seriously.
[09:33.960 --> 09:35.200]  And this, just a phenohunt.
[09:35.200 --> 09:38.400]  Imagine if he was actually taking the seeds to market.
[09:38.400 --> 09:39.240]  Right.
[09:39.240 --> 09:40.160]  It's a two year project.
[09:40.160 --> 09:42.320]  Yeah, exactly, because I would want to run
[09:42.320 --> 09:44.400]  at least 100 of those seeds myself.
[09:44.400 --> 09:46.360]  After I ran 20 or 50 of them myself,
[09:46.360 --> 09:48.240]  I would start sending 10 packs out to friends.
[09:48.240 --> 09:49.480]  I'd give you 10 of them.
[09:49.480 --> 09:50.960]  Like, grow these now.
[09:50.960 --> 09:52.520]  Don't fuck around, grow these now.
[09:52.520 --> 09:54.280]  Send them out to friends that are eager to grow.
[09:54.280 --> 09:55.780]  They would grow them right away.
[09:55.780 --> 09:56.720]  They would send me pictures.
[09:56.720 --> 09:57.760]  They would send me feedback.
[09:57.760 --> 09:59.280]  If they're local, I get to go.
[09:59.280 --> 10:00.920]  I get to go to Rasta Ralph's garden
[10:00.920 --> 10:02.600]  and look at my Blue Healer growing.
[10:02.600 --> 10:04.760]  I get to go to people's places and see my plants
[10:04.760 --> 10:06.720]  growing in their gardens and get feedback.
[10:06.720 --> 10:08.860]  Which improves my breeding.
[10:08.860 --> 10:09.920]  Because then I can say, oh God,
[10:09.920 --> 10:12.200]  I never want to breed with that fucking plant ever again.
[10:12.200 --> 10:14.160]  What is the Blue Healer?
[10:14.160 --> 10:17.680]  Blue Healer is the blue dream and the grateful dog.
[10:17.680 --> 10:18.520]  Oh, okay.
[10:18.520 --> 10:19.440]  Shout out to Spencer for the name.
[10:19.440 --> 10:21.280]  I was like, I'm gonna cross the blue dream
[10:21.280 --> 10:22.120]  and the grateful dog.
[10:22.120 --> 10:23.320]  And he goes, that's Blue Healer.
[10:23.320 --> 10:25.000]  He just spit it out like it was nothing.
[10:25.000 --> 10:26.160]  So that's the name it got.
[10:26.160 --> 10:28.080]  Yeah, he got packs of seeds for that.
[10:29.800 --> 10:32.000]  I don't think I've ever grown a blue dream cross.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.840]  It's not my favorite strain in the world to be honest.
[10:34.840 --> 10:36.700]  That was kind of my goal.
[10:36.700 --> 10:38.680]  Colorado is in love with blue dream
[10:38.680 --> 10:41.620]  and the girls in California are in love with blue dream.
[10:41.620 --> 10:43.000]  It's a cash crop plant.
[10:43.000 --> 10:44.820]  It does have some additional value,
[10:44.820 --> 10:48.440]  but it's used too much here as a cash crop plant.
[10:48.440 --> 10:52.080]  For what it is, it's a,
[10:52.080 --> 10:54.000]  and I forgot the cross of it suddenly.
[10:54.000 --> 10:55.840]  That it's blueberry and silver haze.
[10:55.840 --> 10:57.120]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:57.120 --> 11:00.880]  It's by DJ Short's son or something like that, isn't it?
[11:00.880 --> 11:01.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:01.720 --> 11:02.540]  JD Short.
[11:02.540 --> 11:03.380]  Or his son-in-law or something like that.
[11:03.380 --> 11:04.880]  You know, I'm not sure if that's actually true
[11:04.880 --> 11:06.920]  because I've, that's up for debate.
[11:06.920 --> 11:08.760]  Guys, if you know the truth of where the blue dream
[11:08.760 --> 11:09.600]  came from, let me know.
[11:09.600 --> 11:11.200]  Because I've heard a couple of stories.
[11:11.200 --> 11:12.800]  But it's a haze and it's a blue dream
[11:12.800 --> 11:14.680]  and it's got some OG, I think, in there.
[11:14.680 --> 11:15.880]  But you would think from what I've read,
[11:15.880 --> 11:18.120]  I remember thinking that would be the ideal strain.
[11:18.120 --> 11:19.800]  But then I remember getting my hands on a couple
[11:19.800 --> 11:21.400]  of different grows of it and smoking it
[11:21.400 --> 11:22.640]  and being like, this is mediocre.
[11:22.640 --> 11:25.640]  I've heard there's an amazing fucking phenotype of it.
[11:25.640 --> 11:27.280]  The Andes blue dream phenotype
[11:27.280 --> 11:29.000]  is the most impressive I've seen.
[11:29.000 --> 11:29.840]  Yeah, wow.
[11:29.840 --> 11:31.480]  And there's, it's just a phenotype, you guys.
[11:31.480 --> 11:32.560]  It's labeled ABD.
[11:32.560 --> 11:33.400]  It's Andes blue dream.
[11:33.400 --> 11:34.560]  I tend to think that's just the blue dream
[11:34.560 --> 11:35.600]  that's everywhere.
[11:35.600 --> 11:37.760]  Yeah, it's all over Colorado.
[11:37.760 --> 11:38.600]  Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[11:38.600 --> 11:39.760]  And that's the one I bred with.
[11:39.760 --> 11:41.240]  I'm pretty sure it's the one I bred too.
[11:41.240 --> 11:42.400]  Yeah.
[11:42.400 --> 11:44.960]  But the blue dream kicks out, you can pull two pounds
[11:44.960 --> 11:46.320]  under a thousand watt light and soil
[11:46.320 --> 11:47.560]  with that blue dream cup.
[11:47.560 --> 11:48.400]  Easily.
[11:48.400 --> 11:49.660]  With a short, short veg time.
[11:49.660 --> 11:53.640]  We did one with a real short veg time last year outdoors.
[11:53.640 --> 11:55.120]  It did like three and a half pounds.
[11:55.520 --> 11:56.720]  I mean.
[11:56.720 --> 12:00.120]  But the problem is it doesn't have an appealing high to me
[12:00.120 --> 12:02.000]  and it doesn't make enough hash to make it worth
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.840]  its time, space, energy, nutrients, whatever else.
[12:04.840 --> 12:05.680]  You know what I mean?
[12:05.680 --> 12:07.280]  I could replace that with a bounty killer
[12:07.280 --> 12:09.080]  and have way better medicine.
[12:09.080 --> 12:11.960]  If it smelled like it, or if it tasted like it smelled.
[12:11.960 --> 12:12.800]  Yeah.
[12:12.800 --> 12:15.280]  It'd be the most popular strain in the world.
[12:15.280 --> 12:17.040]  Well, my goal when I hit it with the Grateful Dog
[12:17.040 --> 12:18.960]  was to put that resin on it.
[12:18.960 --> 12:19.960]  That was, and it worked.
[12:19.960 --> 12:20.880]  It definitely worked.
[12:20.880 --> 12:22.920]  It made it, shortened the flowering time.
[12:22.920 --> 12:24.460]  It made the plants a little stockier
[12:24.500 --> 12:27.220]  and it put some resin and a little bit of funk to it.
[12:27.220 --> 12:29.500]  Which is what all, that's all that Blue Dream was missing
[12:29.500 --> 12:30.580]  was resin and funk.
[12:30.580 --> 12:33.060]  And it was getting too tall for a lot of indoor grows.
[12:33.060 --> 12:36.000]  Oh, I bet the DJ Short came out of, I mean.
[12:37.500 --> 12:40.400]  Anything with his stuff always seems to be really dominant.
[12:42.100 --> 12:44.580]  A lot, you know, it says a lot for his breeding.
[12:44.580 --> 12:46.860]  It's because he's taken it to the F5
[12:46.860 --> 12:48.620]  before he releases his packages,
[12:48.620 --> 12:49.740]  which is pretty impressive.
[12:49.740 --> 12:53.460]  And he has a style of his own.
[12:53.460 --> 12:56.180]  I've heard him argue with many people
[12:56.180 --> 12:58.220]  on podcasts and interviews.
[12:58.220 --> 13:00.580]  Yes, you know, a couple of minutes ago,
[13:00.580 --> 13:03.300]  I dissed the old generation.
[13:03.300 --> 13:04.940]  DJ Short is the old generation, bro.
[13:04.940 --> 13:06.300]  We gotta give him mad love.
[13:06.300 --> 13:07.140]  Oh, yeah.
[13:07.140 --> 13:07.960]  He's one of the guys back in the day
[13:07.960 --> 13:09.360]  that was doing it right for genetics.
[13:09.360 --> 13:10.580]  If it weren't for DJ Short,
[13:10.580 --> 13:11.660]  I don't think you and I would be
[13:11.660 --> 13:13.140]  where we are in the cannabis game.
[13:13.140 --> 13:14.820]  No, I don't think anyone would be.
[13:14.820 --> 13:15.660]  True.
[13:15.660 --> 13:18.220]  I mean, yeah, DJ's done a lot for the preservation
[13:18.220 --> 13:19.460]  and just everything.
[13:20.420 --> 13:21.480]  I might be a brick in the wall,
[13:21.480 --> 13:23.380]  but DJ Short was part of the foundation.
[13:24.300 --> 13:25.220]  Boom.
[13:25.220 --> 13:26.100]  Cornerstone.
[13:26.100 --> 13:27.060]  Yes.
[13:27.060 --> 13:29.380]  Was up there with some of the original authors
[13:29.380 --> 13:32.020]  and stuff like that, or guys like that.
[13:32.020 --> 13:33.260]  Yeah.
[13:33.260 --> 13:34.800]  I'll give Subcool Mad credit also.
[13:34.800 --> 13:38.020]  He's not as old as Subcool or as DJ Short,
[13:38.020 --> 13:39.820]  but he's in that generation between them,
[13:39.820 --> 13:41.460]  between us and DJ.
[13:41.460 --> 13:43.220]  So we gotta give him mad love for his breeding
[13:43.220 --> 13:44.660]  and for what he did for the community also,
[13:44.660 --> 13:46.380]  since we're shut down breeders.
[13:46.380 --> 13:48.100]  And if we're gonna go with old guys,
[13:48.100 --> 13:49.300]  you guys know I'm gonna say it,
[13:49.300 --> 13:51.940]  Soma deserves a high five and a hug.
[13:51.940 --> 13:52.780]  Yeah, big namaste to Soma.
[13:53.180 --> 13:55.340]  Soma taught me how to grow on OG.
[13:56.420 --> 13:58.780]  I did not know anything about,
[13:58.780 --> 14:00.900]  I'd never, I'd read Soma's posts,
[14:00.900 --> 14:02.500]  but I never realized he was a dreadlock
[14:02.500 --> 14:04.220]  and I never knew he was a dirty hippie.
[14:04.220 --> 14:06.520]  And I didn't know he had amethyst everywhere
[14:06.520 --> 14:08.020]  and crystals on everything.
[14:08.020 --> 14:09.900]  I figured he was an Indian dude.
[14:10.780 --> 14:11.600]  It did seem.
[14:11.600 --> 14:13.100]  Like the country India, yeah.
[14:13.100 --> 14:15.140]  And my friend Donovan one day,
[14:15.140 --> 14:18.940]  who was a big user of overgrow.com,
[14:18.940 --> 14:20.060]  he was always on there.
[14:20.060 --> 14:22.520]  And one day he's like, bro, you remind me so much of Soma,
[14:23.260 --> 14:24.100]  the way that you talk,
[14:24.100 --> 14:26.000]  because I was preaching my grow from your heart theory.
[14:26.000 --> 14:26.840]  You know what I mean?
[14:26.840 --> 14:27.660]  Like go in your grow room,
[14:27.660 --> 14:28.500]  and I still think this,
[14:28.500 --> 14:29.840]  you gotta go in your grow room once in a while
[14:29.840 --> 14:31.880]  and just sit there and just meditate
[14:31.880 --> 14:32.720]  and just close your eyes
[14:32.720 --> 14:33.880]  and think about the goodness
[14:33.880 --> 14:35.000]  that those plants are gonna do,
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.960]  because you're growing a plant
[14:36.960 --> 14:39.280]  that is going to heal somebody in some sort of way.
[14:39.280 --> 14:40.200]  They're gonna feel better.
[14:40.200 --> 14:41.760]  Even if they're a recreational smoker,
[14:41.760 --> 14:43.080]  if they're a medical smoker,
[14:43.080 --> 14:45.280]  somebody is gonna be uplifted and better
[14:45.280 --> 14:46.880]  because of the product that you're growing.
[14:46.880 --> 14:48.760]  And that's gotta feel good inside.
[14:48.760 --> 14:51.120]  So I'd go in there and kinda meditate a little bit on that
[14:51.120 --> 14:53.080]  and feel that golden, we'd share it.
[14:53.080 --> 14:54.640]  The plants love me, I love them,
[14:54.640 --> 14:55.800]  and then they heal somebody else,
[14:55.800 --> 14:57.440]  and then that person hugs me when they see me,
[14:57.440 --> 14:58.280]  and the next time they go,
[14:58.280 --> 15:00.640]  dude, that grateful dog was so good.
[15:00.640 --> 15:02.280]  And then I get to go grow better weed
[15:02.280 --> 15:03.320]  because I just got a good hug,
[15:03.320 --> 15:05.720]  and it just perpetuates this golden cycle.
[15:05.720 --> 15:08.080]  So I was talking about that exact hippie shit
[15:08.080 --> 15:09.360]  that I just said, and my buddy's like,
[15:09.360 --> 15:11.000]  dude, you're like fucking Soma.
[15:11.000 --> 15:12.920]  And I was like, I've heard of Soma, I've read his post.
[15:12.920 --> 15:14.480]  And he's like, no, go get his book.
[15:14.480 --> 15:15.400]  And I went and got his book,
[15:15.400 --> 15:18.080]  and I was like, this guy is who I was going to be
[15:18.080 --> 15:19.840]  in 20 years if I didn't know.
[15:19.960 --> 15:22.040]  I was already this guy.
[15:22.040 --> 15:23.640]  I was already on the path of being Soma.
[15:23.640 --> 15:24.560]  So much respect.
[15:24.560 --> 15:27.040]  We just got off on a random tangent of giving a DJ short.
[15:27.040 --> 15:31.800]  He did no-till organic before any of y'all thought of it.
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.440]  As cool as it is, no one's doing nothing new there.
[15:35.440 --> 15:37.040]  True, yeah, Soma's been on top.
[15:37.040 --> 15:39.520]  And the beds, the four by four beds.
[15:39.520 --> 15:41.560]  I built them out of Rubbermaid containers,
[15:41.560 --> 15:43.880]  but I used the same principle
[15:43.880 --> 15:45.760]  with the drainage and everything.
[15:45.760 --> 15:49.120]  I can support 99% of what Soma says.
[15:49.160 --> 15:50.800]  Subcool, I love his growing style.
[15:50.800 --> 15:51.800]  Sometimes he says some shit
[15:51.800 --> 15:53.280]  that I'm not gonna put my signature on.
[15:53.280 --> 15:56.240]  But you know what, I don't discredit that.
[15:56.240 --> 15:57.720]  The dude's got fucking integrity.
[15:57.720 --> 15:59.160]  He's made a lot of strains,
[15:59.160 --> 16:02.680]  and he was one of the first people to take good pictures
[16:04.560 --> 16:07.840]  with a good camera of buds and send them into high times.
[16:07.840 --> 16:10.840]  Anybody that's followed me on Facebook since the beginning
[16:10.840 --> 16:13.600]  knows without any saying that fucking Subcool
[16:13.600 --> 16:16.000]  inspired 50% of my photography.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.520]  That's where I got a lot of the idea.
[16:17.560 --> 16:19.360]  You guys have a real similar style
[16:19.360 --> 16:20.440]  now that you mention it.
[16:20.440 --> 16:23.240]  Our grow style, our photography style,
[16:23.240 --> 16:24.640]  the whole thing is kinda,
[16:24.640 --> 16:25.920]  I didn't know that until someone's like,
[16:25.920 --> 16:27.200]  you should check out the Weed Nerd.
[16:27.200 --> 16:28.280]  And I was like, okay.
[16:28.280 --> 16:30.920]  There's a lot to learn in some of his older episodes
[16:30.920 --> 16:33.800]  if you're interested in the way he does things.
[16:33.800 --> 16:36.240]  Subcool on the YouTube, the YouTube.
[16:36.240 --> 16:37.480]  I sound like an old guy when I say that.
[16:37.480 --> 16:38.320]  The Weed Nerd.
[16:38.320 --> 16:39.480]  The Weed Nerd, yeah, check that out.
[16:39.480 --> 16:41.120]  The older stuff is really good.
[16:41.120 --> 16:43.840]  There came a point when it got to be too...
[16:43.840 --> 16:44.680]  Redundant.
[16:44.680 --> 16:46.800]  Redundant, and he headbanged for 15 minutes
[16:47.080 --> 16:47.920]  for episodes.
[16:47.920 --> 16:48.760]  Even he knows that.
[16:48.760 --> 16:49.600]  He says it all the time.
[16:49.600 --> 16:51.400]  Well, I'm getting to 100 episodes,
[16:51.400 --> 16:52.880]  and there's only so much you could talk about
[16:52.880 --> 16:53.920]  about cannabis, you know what I mean?
[16:53.920 --> 16:55.280]  Like, there's all these news and stuff,
[16:55.280 --> 16:57.000]  so that's why I fall to the news sometimes.
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  But it's going to be,
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.600]  now that once we get to episode 100,
[17:00.600 --> 17:01.840]  we're gonna go a little more in depth.
[17:01.840 --> 17:03.440]  I've gone through the basics,
[17:03.440 --> 17:05.080]  and now it's time to dig in a little bit.
[17:05.080 --> 17:07.000]  I think our friends, our listeners.
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.200]  Periscope, I think that's a really great tool
[17:09.200 --> 17:10.120]  for a podcast.
[17:10.120 --> 17:12.200]  Okay, so I've been opening Periscope
[17:12.200 --> 17:14.360]  and doing random shit on there occasionally.
[17:14.360 --> 17:16.360]  But now that we've got this good foundation,
[17:16.880 --> 17:18.480]  and you guys have had your basic rudimentary classes,
[17:18.480 --> 17:20.520]  I think it's almost time around episode 100
[17:20.520 --> 17:21.400]  to start pushing it,
[17:21.400 --> 17:23.120]  and start going to the B-level courses.
[17:23.120 --> 17:25.400]  We're gonna college level you guys here pretty soon.
[17:25.400 --> 17:26.320]  We'll get Sean back.
[17:26.320 --> 17:27.880]  You'll have to get out the notepad again.
[17:27.880 --> 17:28.720]  We're gonna do this right.
[17:28.720 --> 17:29.560]  The 201s.
[17:29.560 --> 17:31.800]  Yeah, all right.
[17:31.800 --> 17:33.040]  So we're gonna wrap this part up.
[17:33.040 --> 17:34.000]  We've been going for a long time.
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.360]  Dude, Jesse, thanks for coming, man.
[17:35.360 --> 17:36.920]  Oh yeah, no problem.
[17:36.920 --> 17:37.760]  Oh, let's see.
[17:37.760 --> 17:39.480]  Let's do a little outdoor update real quick.
[17:39.480 --> 17:40.680]  Okay.
[17:40.680 --> 17:43.400]  Here lately in Southern Colorado, at least,
[17:43.400 --> 17:45.600]  it has been cold and humid at night,
[17:45.600 --> 17:47.320]  and hot and dry during the day.
[17:47.320 --> 17:48.280]  True that.
[17:48.280 --> 17:51.000]  That is a recipe for powdery mold.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  So, bud rot.
[17:55.120 --> 17:57.760]  It's part of the reason Cali bud stands out.
[17:57.760 --> 17:59.680]  They get a marine layer with this too.
[17:59.680 --> 18:04.680]  But, you know, this year I've seen a lot of Cali style,
[18:04.680 --> 18:07.560]  or what I always call Cali style problems
[18:07.560 --> 18:09.620]  that we've never had here before.
[18:09.620 --> 18:12.220]  So, be prepared for that stuff.
[18:12.220 --> 18:14.160]  How can we prevent getting powdery mildew
[18:14.160 --> 18:16.120]  with these crispy cold nights that we're getting?
[18:16.120 --> 18:17.720]  There's a lot of moisture in the air tonight.
[18:17.720 --> 18:18.560]  I can already feel it.
[18:18.560 --> 18:22.200]  Yeah, there's, I mean, any number of things.
[18:22.200 --> 18:24.400]  I'm personally using Actinovate.
[18:24.400 --> 18:26.400]  I mean, we're in bloom too.
[18:27.880 --> 18:30.560]  But it's, you know, I see it on the cucumbers.
[18:30.560 --> 18:31.880]  I see it on the squash.
[18:31.880 --> 18:33.280]  I see it on the watermelon.
[18:34.440 --> 18:36.280]  That's a different strain.
[18:36.280 --> 18:39.540]  It doesn't really affect cannabis
[18:39.540 --> 18:41.760]  from what I've seen and been told.
[18:42.760 --> 18:46.920]  But to me it's an indication that the climate
[18:46.920 --> 18:49.720]  for it to grow is present.
[18:49.720 --> 18:52.440]  Yes, I can't speak on that now,
[18:52.440 --> 18:56.360]  but within the next 30 days I am going to become
[18:56.360 --> 18:58.280]  what is called applicator certified
[18:58.280 --> 18:59.880]  by the Department of Agriculture.
[18:59.880 --> 19:01.560]  Nice, my cousin's up.
[19:01.560 --> 19:04.360]  Yeah, it seems, I've looked at the test.
[19:04.360 --> 19:05.600]  It seems to be fairly easy.
[19:05.600 --> 19:07.640]  It's an open book test.
[19:07.640 --> 19:10.800]  Somebody that works, I'm now the lead grower.
[19:10.800 --> 19:13.120]  Myself and my friend John are now the lead growers
[19:13.120 --> 19:14.680]  at the spot dispensary.
[19:14.680 --> 19:17.120]  And today we had our first pre-inspection
[19:17.120 --> 19:18.400]  from the Department of Agriculture
[19:18.400 --> 19:21.760]  before we grow anything in there, in our new grow areas.
[19:21.760 --> 19:22.720]  Wow.
[19:22.720 --> 19:23.680]  Dude.
[19:23.680 --> 19:26.280]  I've only been out of the industry for what, nine months?
[19:26.280 --> 19:28.440]  And wow, things have changed.
[19:28.440 --> 19:29.880]  Yes, yes, you have to have
[19:29.880 --> 19:31.720]  Department of Agriculture meetings.
[19:31.720 --> 19:33.320]  It was about an hour and a half long meeting.
[19:33.320 --> 19:37.460]  They told us basically what we need to do to be compliant,
[19:37.460 --> 19:39.260]  which is, it's all basic stuff.
[19:39.260 --> 19:41.540]  And it's mostly since the spot was designed
[19:41.540 --> 19:44.020]  well it's shit that we're already doing.
[19:44.020 --> 19:47.020]  But you have to have one, at least one person
[19:47.020 --> 19:50.340]  on the staff that can train employees
[19:50.340 --> 19:55.140]  on pesticide and insecticide and fungicide safety.
[19:55.140 --> 19:55.960]  Good.
[19:55.960 --> 19:57.460]  Yeah, and so I took it upon myself to say,
[19:57.460 --> 19:59.980]  hey, I'm lead grower, I'll go do this.
[19:59.980 --> 20:02.140]  And the boss is gonna pay for it of course
[20:02.140 --> 20:03.180]  because it's a work related thing
[20:03.180 --> 20:05.660]  and it's something that I feel like I should do anyway.
[20:05.660 --> 20:06.860]  Like when they offered that course,
[20:06.860 --> 20:08.420]  I was like, I wanna go to this, I wanna go to this.
[20:08.460 --> 20:09.300]  Yeah, fuck yeah.
[20:09.300 --> 20:10.120]  Yeah, that's so.
[20:10.120 --> 20:11.980]  Yeah, that's great, man.
[20:11.980 --> 20:15.020]  Within 30 days, I will, I have to take the test
[20:15.020 --> 20:16.300]  within 30 days. Kudos to the spot too.
[20:16.300 --> 20:18.460]  I know some owners would be really pissed
[20:18.460 --> 20:20.100]  about having to do shit like this.
[20:20.100 --> 20:23.340]  Right, you gotta, in the cannabis industry.
[20:23.340 --> 20:24.180]  Heard of.
[20:24.180 --> 20:27.380]  You gotta, you gotta, allegedly.
[20:27.380 --> 20:29.160]  You gotta spend money to fucking make money
[20:29.160 --> 20:30.740]  in the cannabis industry, you guys.
[20:30.740 --> 20:32.740]  It is hard to survive right now
[20:32.740 --> 20:35.380]  if you don't have some money to put in inventory.
[20:35.380 --> 20:37.300]  If your shelves aren't stocked with
[20:37.300 --> 20:39.020]  20 different kinds of buds,
[20:39.020 --> 20:40.180]  if your shelves aren't stocked with
[20:40.180 --> 20:41.980]  20 different kinds of edibles,
[20:41.980 --> 20:44.740]  four different topicals, a lollipop over here,
[20:44.740 --> 20:47.620]  some t-shirts over here, socks over here.
[20:47.620 --> 20:49.500]  You guys gotta fill every revenue channel.
[20:49.500 --> 20:50.980]  Japanese or Chinese water pipes.
[20:50.980 --> 20:53.740]  Yeah, yeah, good water pipes, Chinese water pipes,
[20:53.740 --> 20:55.180]  knock off nails, high end nails.
[20:55.180 --> 20:57.380]  Yeah, shout out to Three Rivers Organics.
[20:57.380 --> 20:59.860]  They got some cool Hitman shit in there.
[20:59.860 --> 21:01.580]  Wow, your eyes are really red.
[21:01.580 --> 21:03.100]  I just took a fat, fat nap.
[21:03.100 --> 21:03.940]  Yeah.
[21:03.940 --> 21:05.220]  Just took a, I'm over here coughing
[21:05.220 --> 21:07.280]  and only saying short sentences.
[21:08.120 --> 21:09.800]  Does it match my red in my shirt yet?
[21:09.800 --> 21:10.640]  Pretty close.
[21:10.640 --> 21:12.160]  Nice.
[21:12.160 --> 21:13.600]  Back to the outdoor stuff.
[21:13.600 --> 21:15.040]  Yes, let's go there.
[21:15.040 --> 21:19.920]  But yeah, Actinovate, Green Cure,
[21:19.920 --> 21:23.020]  I don't really see that as a preventative,
[21:24.080 --> 21:26.680]  but if you do use it, make sure you use it at night
[21:26.680 --> 21:28.460]  and follow the directions.
[21:30.160 --> 21:32.520]  Whatever, you know, there's all kinds of stuff
[21:32.520 --> 21:33.760]  you can be spraying on it.
[21:33.760 --> 21:35.540]  Just get a good one.
[21:36.540 --> 21:38.860]  Just stay away from neem oil,
[21:39.820 --> 21:43.500]  since all your plants should be in bloom.
[21:43.500 --> 21:47.800]  Yeah, I was gifted a product called Stilett Oil.
[21:48.940 --> 21:49.760]  I've heard of it.
[21:49.760 --> 21:52.020]  I did a consultation and somebody,
[21:52.020 --> 21:55.540]  an older gentleman who is not as able-bodied
[21:55.540 --> 21:57.620]  as most of us, he's a little slower,
[21:57.620 --> 21:58.900]  you might call him handicapped,
[21:58.900 --> 22:00.180]  he's trying to grow his own cannabis,
[22:00.180 --> 22:02.780]  it's his first grow, it's his second grow.
[22:02.780 --> 22:04.380]  And I gave him a free consultation
[22:04.420 --> 22:06.860]  and he had just the starts of powdery mildew.
[22:06.860 --> 22:10.220]  And I was like, man, I, and he was in about
[22:10.220 --> 22:12.180]  starting week three of flower.
[22:12.180 --> 22:13.960]  And I was like, man, I don't really want you
[22:13.960 --> 22:15.180]  to spray anything on there,
[22:15.180 --> 22:17.940]  but you're gonna lose your crop if you don't.
[22:17.940 --> 22:19.780]  And he said, I Googled some stuff
[22:19.780 --> 22:21.300]  and they say oils and things.
[22:21.300 --> 22:23.380]  And I said, don't put neem oil on there.
[22:23.380 --> 22:26.700]  I said, put some worm casting tea on there.
[22:26.700 --> 22:29.220]  The worm didn't do a damn thing.
[22:29.220 --> 22:31.140]  That's most definitely preventative.
[22:31.140 --> 22:32.740]  I mean, yeah, yeah.
[22:32.740 --> 22:33.740]  It didn't do shit.
[22:33.780 --> 22:36.500]  So I told him, I said, well, you're gonna,
[22:36.500 --> 22:37.660]  this crop is gonna be fucked
[22:37.660 --> 22:39.020]  because the powdery mildew was getting,
[22:39.020 --> 22:40.780]  it wasn't thick, but you could see it popping up
[22:40.780 --> 22:42.060]  in the little circles.
[22:42.060 --> 22:45.740]  And so I said, I've got a product called stylet oil
[22:45.740 --> 22:46.820]  that I've never used.
[22:46.820 --> 22:48.660]  And a friend of mine sent it to me
[22:48.660 --> 22:50.260]  to encourage me to use it.
[22:50.260 --> 22:53.940]  And he said that it will destroy powdery mildew on contact.
[22:53.940 --> 22:55.580]  And he said, spray it on there.
[22:55.580 --> 22:56.460]  And he's an old dude.
[22:56.460 --> 22:58.380]  I said, this is your medicine that you're,
[22:58.380 --> 23:00.340]  and he said, yes, I know, I need this,
[23:00.340 --> 23:01.500]  spray that on there.
[23:01.500 --> 23:02.620]  He knew what I was doing
[23:02.620 --> 23:04.620]  and it was his decision.
[23:04.620 --> 23:06.300]  I sprayed the stylet oil on there.
[23:06.300 --> 23:09.500]  Dude, that shit took down the powdery mildew on contact.
[23:09.500 --> 23:10.660]  It destroyed it.
[23:10.660 --> 23:11.500]  Nice, nice.
[23:11.500 --> 23:12.620]  I've never actually used it.
[23:12.620 --> 23:14.980]  I've heard you can burn the shit out
[23:14.980 --> 23:15.820]  of some plants with it, though.
[23:15.820 --> 23:17.780]  Absolutely, that's one of the things.
[23:17.780 --> 23:20.740]  A guy named, I don't know if I should say his real name.
[23:20.740 --> 23:23.100]  He's known as Treetown, is what I know him as.
[23:23.100 --> 23:24.180]  Treetown Farmer.
[23:24.180 --> 23:25.660]  He's the one that recommended this to me
[23:25.660 --> 23:26.500]  and hooked me up with it.
[23:26.500 --> 23:28.580]  He's a vendor for the product, of course.
[23:28.580 --> 23:29.980]  He's like, check this out.
[23:29.980 --> 23:32.300]  So I didn't have anything to use it on.
[23:32.980 --> 23:34.780]  I didn't have any mildew or anything like that.
[23:34.780 --> 23:36.700]  So when this dude was like, I got powdery mildew,
[23:36.700 --> 23:38.500]  I was like, this is what I've got to offer you.
[23:38.500 --> 23:42.620]  And something about the way that it coats the leaves,
[23:42.620 --> 23:46.260]  it causes, it breaks the membrane of the powdery mildew
[23:46.260 --> 23:48.180]  and it doesn't allow it to grow on your leaf,
[23:48.180 --> 23:49.860]  is basically what I read.
[23:49.860 --> 23:51.860]  And when that shit hit the leaf,
[23:51.860 --> 23:53.820]  it just washed it right off.
[23:53.820 --> 23:54.900]  We did it with the lights off.
[23:54.900 --> 23:58.100]  Turn the lights off, just turn a normal lamp on.
[23:58.100 --> 24:00.020]  As you should with most pesticides, actually.
[24:00.020 --> 24:01.660]  Yeah, with any spray, you want the lights off.
[24:01.980 --> 24:04.580]  There are a few that you actually need the lights on.
[24:06.140 --> 24:08.180]  Sometimes you need to heat the room up to get rid of it.
[24:08.180 --> 24:09.820]  Yeah, that's what the deal is.
[24:09.820 --> 24:10.980]  You actually need to heat the room
[24:10.980 --> 24:12.840]  to activate the oils in the plants.
[24:12.840 --> 24:16.340]  So we sprayed it with the stylet oil
[24:16.340 --> 24:17.940]  and then let it sit overnight
[24:17.940 --> 24:19.220]  and then we went back the next morning
[24:19.220 --> 24:22.220]  and rinsed the stylet oil off with just clean water.
[24:22.220 --> 24:24.900]  Also very important for most pesticides.
[24:24.900 --> 24:26.980]  Yes, you want to unclog the plants.
[24:26.980 --> 24:28.260]  They want to be able to breathe.
[24:28.260 --> 24:29.920]  So go and rinse that shit off
[24:29.920 --> 24:32.000]  and then those plants just came out of it
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.080]  and they're amazing.
[24:33.080 --> 24:33.920]  Nice, nice.
[24:33.920 --> 24:34.980]  He got to harvest his crop.
[24:34.980 --> 24:36.360]  This was several weeks ago.
[24:36.360 --> 24:37.340]  He got to harvest his crop.
[24:37.340 --> 24:38.800]  I looked at it, I helped him trim some of it.
[24:38.800 --> 24:40.160]  I showed him how to trim it.
[24:40.160 --> 24:41.760]  No signs of powdery mildew.
[24:41.760 --> 24:44.120]  Gorgeous crop, smelled pretty good.
[24:44.120 --> 24:45.600]  I haven't smoked any of it,
[24:45.600 --> 24:47.820]  so I don't know if it tastes like stylet oil.
[24:47.820 --> 24:49.280]  But he's an older cat.
[24:49.280 --> 24:51.120]  He's like your dad.
[24:51.120 --> 24:52.620]  He just needs a bunch of herb to smoke
[24:52.620 --> 24:54.840]  so he doesn't get hurt and lose his damn mind.
[24:54.840 --> 24:55.680]  What is stylet oil?
[24:55.680 --> 24:56.960]  I think that's a hybrid.
[24:56.960 --> 24:58.980]  It's, you know, I don't have it in this room.
[24:58.980 --> 25:00.900]  I should have had it handy before I brought it up,
[25:00.900 --> 25:02.140]  but I wasn't prepared for that,
[25:02.140 --> 25:03.540]  so fail on my part.
[25:03.540 --> 25:05.060]  It's just a white oil.
[25:05.060 --> 25:07.220]  Yeah, I did some research on it once.
[25:07.220 --> 25:08.060]  And I said white.
[25:08.060 --> 25:09.460]  It's not colored white.
[25:09.460 --> 25:10.940]  It's just considered a white oil.
[25:10.940 --> 25:12.500]  It's not thick and white or anything.
[25:12.500 --> 25:13.340]  Nice, yeah.
[25:13.340 --> 25:16.860]  When I heard about it, it was kind of pre-Amazon times.
[25:16.860 --> 25:18.380]  I just couldn't get my hands on it.
[25:18.380 --> 25:19.340]  Yeah.
[25:19.340 --> 25:21.100]  Yeah, it's available now and it's cheap.
[25:21.100 --> 25:22.260]  It's actually quite affordable.
[25:22.260 --> 25:23.080]  Nice, nice.
[25:23.080 --> 25:24.460]  So it's a preventative as an outdoor
[25:24.460 --> 25:25.720]  if you need to rescue something.
[25:25.720 --> 25:27.460]  It's something you could look into.
[25:27.460 --> 25:29.300]  Green Cure, if you hit it just right,
[25:29.300 --> 25:32.340]  will take care of a light infestation,
[25:32.340 --> 25:35.220]  but it's kind of touchy too.
[25:35.220 --> 25:36.060]  Right.
[25:36.060 --> 25:38.020]  It's anything when you're in the flowering phase
[25:38.020 --> 25:40.020]  and applying a foliar spray of any type
[25:40.020 --> 25:41.540]  is a touchy situation.
[25:41.540 --> 25:44.700]  De-leafing, just removing the leaf out of,
[25:44.700 --> 25:47.020]  and taking it out of the area.
[25:47.020 --> 25:48.780]  Washing your hands.
[25:48.780 --> 25:50.980]  Don't touch them when it's wet.
[25:50.980 --> 25:54.180]  That's actually, I've been told it spreads easier
[25:54.180 --> 25:55.140]  at that point, so.
[25:55.140 --> 25:55.980]  Oh, okay.
[25:56.980 --> 25:59.100]  That's something I've been told, so.
[26:00.340 --> 26:01.180]  I would believe it.
[26:01.180 --> 26:04.420]  I haven't been able to put that to work too much,
[26:04.420 --> 26:07.540]  but yeah, haven't had a need to.
[26:07.540 --> 26:09.340]  And if you've got powdery mildew in your grow room,
[26:09.340 --> 26:11.420]  you've got something to correct in the room,
[26:11.420 --> 26:12.500]  you've got some work to do,
[26:12.500 --> 26:14.260]  it's gonna take you a little bit to fix that.
[26:14.260 --> 26:16.060]  You cannot spray away that problem.
[26:16.060 --> 26:16.900]  Yeah.
[26:16.900 --> 26:17.900]  It is an environmental problem.
[26:17.900 --> 26:20.100]  You gotta clean it, you gotta start getting fresh air
[26:20.100 --> 26:21.820]  out of the, or fresh air into the room,
[26:21.820 --> 26:24.740]  stale air out of the room, lower the humidity.
[26:24.980 --> 26:26.940]  But if you get it, also, don't feel bad.
[26:26.940 --> 26:28.580]  I mean, it can even happen outdoors.
[26:28.580 --> 26:29.500]  Oh, that shit happens.
[26:29.500 --> 26:30.340]  Yeah, yeah, that's just.
[26:30.340 --> 26:32.140]  I've talked about having it in a grow room.
[26:32.140 --> 26:34.460]  It happened the first time I moved into a new house.
[26:34.460 --> 26:37.220]  It was August when I moved in, so it was warm.
[26:37.220 --> 26:38.700]  And then that first winter crop,
[26:38.700 --> 26:40.500]  I got powdery mildew on a plant
[26:40.500 --> 26:41.820]  that was in the back corner of the room,
[26:41.820 --> 26:43.580]  because it was the concrete basement wall.
[26:43.580 --> 26:46.460]  It's drastic climate change, or season changes.
[26:46.460 --> 26:47.300]  Yeah.
[26:47.300 --> 26:48.620]  It's easier to run that room in the fall, probably.
[26:48.620 --> 26:49.700]  Wasn't prepared for that.
[26:49.700 --> 26:50.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[26:50.540 --> 26:51.460]  And powdery mildew, boom.
[26:51.460 --> 26:52.460]  So, yeah, it happens.
[26:52.460 --> 26:53.740]  I'm a damn master grower.
[26:53.740 --> 26:54.740]  When I got powdery mildew,
[26:54.740 --> 26:55.580]  that was just five or six years ago.
[26:55.580 --> 26:57.260]  It's experience, don't.
[26:57.260 --> 27:01.420]  I've been told that, when I talk about powdery mold,
[27:01.420 --> 27:05.220]  and both of us have been told that we make people feel bad.
[27:05.220 --> 27:07.220]  So, don't feel bad if it happens.
[27:07.220 --> 27:08.140]  No, you guys.
[27:08.140 --> 27:10.100]  A person at the store told me that the other day.
[27:10.100 --> 27:12.140]  I know I post amazing pictures on Instagram,
[27:12.140 --> 27:16.380]  but it's because I just don't take pictures of my fails.
[27:16.380 --> 27:18.380]  You never take a picture of your poops, do you?
[27:18.380 --> 27:20.060]  He just posts the gold on Instagram,
[27:20.060 --> 27:20.900]  so don't worry, you guys.
[27:20.900 --> 27:22.980]  I'll fuck something up and post a picture of it
[27:23.020 --> 27:24.060]  on Instagram, just for fun.
[27:24.060 --> 27:24.900]  Nice.
[27:24.900 --> 27:25.860]  Just to show you that Ross DeGeff fucks up
[27:25.860 --> 27:26.700]  once in a while.
[27:26.700 --> 27:28.940]  I've had some fuck ups recently, so shit happens.
[27:28.940 --> 27:30.140]  Yeah, the next time I make a mistake,
[27:30.140 --> 27:31.820]  I'll get out the camera and I'll own that shit.
[27:31.820 --> 27:34.180]  I'll be like, look, this is my dumbness right here.
[27:34.180 --> 27:35.500]  Mine's when I get lazy.
[27:35.500 --> 27:38.260]  I overflowed a reservoir the other day,
[27:38.260 --> 27:39.100]  straight into the floor.
[27:39.100 --> 27:41.300]  There's only a couple of gallons of water,
[27:41.300 --> 27:43.700]  but still, when you hear that shit overflow,
[27:43.700 --> 27:46.100]  I was only a few feet away and had my back turned.
[27:46.100 --> 27:47.820]  I was just totally focused on what I was doing,
[27:47.820 --> 27:50.100]  and I heard, and I was like, oh, shit.
[27:50.940 --> 27:52.980]  You just sit there and you feel like a slow kid.
[27:52.980 --> 27:54.380]  You're like, I'm gonna have to take the short bus
[27:54.380 --> 27:56.100]  to work tomorrow after this shit.
[27:57.380 --> 28:00.220]  I was with some people that, in the early days,
[28:00.220 --> 28:03.180]  we were filling res's and took off to lunch
[28:03.180 --> 28:05.220]  and went to the bar, had a couple beers.
[28:05.220 --> 28:06.060]  Oh, shit.
[28:06.060 --> 28:11.060]  So, came back two and a half hours later,
[28:11.740 --> 28:13.540]  and the water was still running.
[28:14.460 --> 28:16.180]  Did you guys have to swim to the reservoir
[28:16.180 --> 28:17.420]  to turn to the nozzle?
[28:17.540 --> 28:21.380]  Luckily, it was a big, like an old mechanic's shop.
[28:21.380 --> 28:24.700]  Just a big steel building with a roll-up door on one side.
[28:24.700 --> 28:26.260]  This was still real early days.
[28:26.260 --> 28:28.940]  It was most definitely trap house worthy,
[28:28.940 --> 28:31.860]  but it was an early legal grow.
[28:33.060 --> 28:33.900]  It was fun.
[28:33.900 --> 28:37.260]  We just rolled up the door, and it was a blast back then.
[28:37.260 --> 28:39.820]  Yeah, back in the day, you could do all kinds of dumb shit
[28:39.820 --> 28:40.660]  that you can't do now.
[28:40.660 --> 28:43.820]  We used to smoke in the dispensary.
[28:43.820 --> 28:45.660]  Smoke in the grow while you're,
[28:45.660 --> 28:48.180]  we had our grow and our dispensary was attached.
[28:48.180 --> 28:49.780]  They were, one floor was the grow,
[28:49.780 --> 28:51.380]  one floor was the dispensary.
[28:51.380 --> 28:54.500]  And so, I would be, we had a camera, of course,
[28:54.500 --> 28:56.540]  with a monitor up there, so I could just look at the monitor
[28:56.540 --> 28:57.700]  and hear the doorbell.
[28:57.700 --> 28:58.540]  So, I'd be watering plants.
[28:58.540 --> 28:59.540]  Nice, similar situation.
[28:59.540 --> 29:01.860]  Smoking a fat joint, just watering plants,
[29:01.860 --> 29:03.340]  living my life, got reggae on,
[29:03.340 --> 29:05.060]  and then you hear the doorbell and just run downstairs.
[29:05.060 --> 29:06.460]  I wouldn't even put out the joint.
[29:06.460 --> 29:08.620]  I'd just set it on the counter.
[29:08.620 --> 29:09.860]  Sometimes, you never know.
[29:09.860 --> 29:11.140]  Yeah, it got hot in that building.
[29:11.140 --> 29:12.940]  I've seen Barefoot and Shirtless,
[29:12.940 --> 29:14.420]  Felon's working in them.
[29:14.420 --> 29:15.260]  Oh, yeah.
[29:15.780 --> 29:17.100]  I was running them originally.
[29:17.100 --> 29:19.420]  A lot of the signs used to be made on cardboard
[29:19.420 --> 29:22.020]  with little hippie drawings and colors,
[29:22.020 --> 29:23.620]  like my girlfriend did it and shit,
[29:23.620 --> 29:25.660]  because that's how it was done.
[29:25.660 --> 29:27.820]  There was nothing printed on a printer back in the day.
[29:27.820 --> 29:29.900]  There was no barcode on any weed product.
[29:29.900 --> 29:31.980]  It was all just grown in someone's basement
[29:31.980 --> 29:34.140]  or upstairs from the dispensary,
[29:34.140 --> 29:36.460]  and then trimmed and then brought right immediately
[29:36.460 --> 29:38.060]  to the grow or to the dispensary,
[29:38.060 --> 29:40.060]  put in a jar and sold.
[29:40.060 --> 29:41.740]  Just, what do you mean we had some weed?
[29:41.740 --> 29:43.220]  And it just turned into money.
[29:43.220 --> 29:46.180]  And despite all that, certain shops still just,
[29:46.180 --> 29:47.660]  boom, had the fire.
[29:49.660 --> 29:51.020]  It used to be better.
[29:51.020 --> 29:52.500]  I think that-
[29:52.500 --> 29:53.340]  I think it is.
[29:53.340 --> 29:54.660]  The dispensary grows.
[29:54.660 --> 29:55.500]  A lot of the grow was grown.
[29:55.500 --> 29:57.380]  It was, yeah.
[29:57.380 --> 29:58.700]  Honest, I used to grow,
[29:58.700 --> 29:59.920]  I worked at Metamore Dispensary.
[29:59.920 --> 30:01.220]  I was the manager.
[30:01.220 --> 30:02.440]  My friend Tom was the owner.
[30:02.440 --> 30:04.780]  I was the manager right underneath him.
[30:04.780 --> 30:05.980]  Tom handed me the keys one day,
[30:05.980 --> 30:07.200]  and he was like, here, you got a dispensary.
[30:07.200 --> 30:08.040]  Have fun.
[30:08.040 --> 30:09.640]  And he paid me very well.
[30:09.640 --> 30:10.940]  So I worked at this dispensary,
[30:10.940 --> 30:14.500]  and I would grow cherry widow at home
[30:14.500 --> 30:15.900]  in my own home grow.
[30:15.900 --> 30:18.660]  And then I would take that cherry widow to the shop
[30:18.660 --> 30:21.500]  and sell it to the boss for a decent price,
[30:21.500 --> 30:22.700]  put it on the shelf,
[30:22.700 --> 30:25.600]  and that was the most fire weed we had in there that week.
[30:26.600 --> 30:27.540]  All right, Podcast World,
[30:27.540 --> 30:29.100]  I want to thank you guys for joining Jesse and I

[30:46.280 --> 30:47.820]  that makes more people see the show.
[30:47.820 --> 30:49.380]  And of course, the more people see the show,
[30:49.380 --> 30:52.460]  the more people will grow better cannabis.
[30:52.460 --> 30:54.300]  More people will become cannabis activists.
[30:54.300 --> 30:56.340]  More people will fight for the plant.
[30:56.340 --> 30:58.180]  The plant will become legalized worldwide,
[30:58.180 --> 31:01.180]  and we will not have to hide ourselves anymore.
[31:01.180 --> 31:02.820]  All right, so please give me a five-star rating.
