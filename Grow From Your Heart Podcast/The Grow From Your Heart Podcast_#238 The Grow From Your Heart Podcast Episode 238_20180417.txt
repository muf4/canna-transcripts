[00:36.760 --> 00:39.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoy these chunks of old episodes.
[00:39.760 --> 00:43.400]  Here we go with a throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:43.400 --> 00:59.940]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:59.940 --> 01:05.940]  It is time for episode number 95 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:05.940 --> 01:06.940]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:06.940 --> 01:07.940]  That's right.
[01:07.940 --> 01:12.940]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[01:12.940 --> 01:16.940]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist, or if you're just someone who's curious about
[01:16.940 --> 01:19.940]  the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:19.940 --> 01:20.940]  I'm your host.
[01:20.940 --> 01:21.940]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:21.940 --> 01:22.940]  I want to thank you guys for joining the show.
[01:22.940 --> 01:23.940]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[01:23.940 --> 01:24.940]  band for allowing me to use their music on the show.
[01:24.940 --> 01:25.940]  Big shout out to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:25.940 --> 01:26.940]  What's up, guys?
[01:26.940 --> 01:27.940]  I'm going to turn down this music.
[01:27.940 --> 01:28.940]  That was a little bit loud this time.
[01:28.940 --> 01:29.940]  I apologize for that.
[01:29.940 --> 01:30.940]  I do not have any ads for this show.
[01:30.940 --> 01:31.940]  I'm not a fan of the show.
[01:31.940 --> 01:32.940]  I'm not a fan of the show.
[01:32.940 --> 01:33.940]  I'm not a fan of the show.
[01:34.940 --> 01:50.040]  to all my friends that joined me for the reggae show a couple of days ago.
[01:50.040 --> 01:53.820]  On Tuesday, I got to go up to the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, Colorado, and I got
[01:53.820 --> 01:59.280]  to see Morgan Heritage, Taurus Riley, Steven Marley, and Damian Marley.
[01:59.280 --> 02:01.260]  It was a great show.
[02:01.260 --> 02:02.480]  Lots of reggae.
[02:02.480 --> 02:03.480]  Lots of good vibes.
[02:03.480 --> 02:09.000]  love, lots of ganja smoking. Big shout out to Arnie and Rive for being great friends.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.080]  They joined me up there. We had a great time at the show. And also big shout out to Danielle
[02:12.080 --> 02:16.480]  for being a great reggae date. Also big shout out to Rasta Stevie. What's up, brother? It
[02:16.480 --> 02:19.480]  was great seeing you there. I think sometimes you might listen to the podcast.
[02:19.480 --> 02:23.920]  All right, you guys. I've got a couple of things coming up in this episode. We are going
[02:23.920 --> 02:28.920]  to address an email that was sent to me from a friend. He wants to talk about something
[02:28.920 --> 02:34.840]  I said in the episode about bag seeds. So we will discuss that. But first, I want to
[02:34.840 --> 02:40.320]  read a news article that just came out. This article came out on September 16th. I found
[02:40.320 --> 02:46.040]  it in The Cannabis of Course. This article was written by David Magoya and Ricardo Baca.
[02:46.040 --> 02:52.520]  And the article headline says Colorado Ag Examining Pot Industry Use of Organic Term.
[02:52.520 --> 02:57.520]  Sub headline says, because marijuana is illegal under federal law, the use of the term organic
[02:57.520 --> 03:02.920]  is federally regulated. A state licensed cannabis business can't be certified as organic
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.600]  no matter their practices. I'm going to turn up my headphones just a little bit and then
[03:06.600 --> 03:12.680]  I will read this article for you. Headphones are loud enough. Here we go. Mic check. Headphones.
[03:12.680 --> 03:16.480]  That's much better. All right. The article goes like this. Colorado's attorney general
[03:16.480 --> 03:20.780]  is investigating several marijuana businesses over concerns the word organic in their names
[03:20.780 --> 03:26.000]  or advertising might be misleading to consumers. The office is reviewing complaints from the
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.160]  consumers that the merchants have been misrepresenting their product when they say organic or organically
[03:31.160 --> 03:36.200]  grown, said Roger Hudson, spokesman for state attorney general Cynthia Kaufman. We're looking
[03:36.200 --> 03:40.280]  for information inside those complaints to make a determination on what those next steps
[03:40.280 --> 03:45.280]  are. Is it consumer fraud? Is it criminal? The AG's office would not give more detail
[03:45.280 --> 03:49.640]  on the scope of the investigation. But a lawyer who represents a marijuana business contacted
[03:49.640 --> 03:55.340]  by investigators said it appears to have limits. The inquiry includes grow operations, some
[03:55.340 --> 04:01.020]  with organic in their names, recently caught up in Denver quarantines over pesticide concerns.
[04:01.020 --> 04:04.260]  Attorney Sean McAllister said, sorry, guys, I read that statement a little bit oddly,
[04:04.260 --> 04:09.320]  but you caught what I said or what it said. The AG is ensuring that business is ensuring
[04:09.320 --> 04:14.060]  that businesses that use the word are at least consistent with the concept of organic. McAllister
[04:14.060 --> 04:19.180]  said because marijuana is illegal under federal law and use of the term organic is federally
[04:19.180 --> 04:25.060]  regulated. A licensed cannabis business cannot be certified as organic no matter its practices.
[04:25.060 --> 04:29.460]  As such, no marijuana businesses in Colorado can technically use the word in its name or
[04:29.460 --> 04:35.000]  in selling its product, according to officials and industry insiders. Potential fraud penalties
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.820]  under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act include fines of up to $10,000 per violation.
[04:40.820 --> 04:44.860]  Federal rules say that businesses wrongly selling a product as organic could face fines
[04:44.860 --> 04:50.780]  of up to $10,000. Yet those rules have not been enforced in Colorado's marijuana businesses
[04:50.780 --> 04:56.700]  until now. State marijuana license records show that 29 businesses, growers, retailers,
[04:56.700 --> 05:01.420]  and dispensaries use the word organic in their name. Some use a trade name containing the
[05:01.420 --> 05:06.620]  word organic to market marijuana products or use the term or do use the term in their
[05:06.620 --> 05:12.180]  advertising. A spot check of websites by the Denver Post found businesses claiming to sell
[05:12.180 --> 05:17.860]  100% organic cannabis, offering organic treatments of medical marijuana or use only organic methods
[05:17.900 --> 05:22.460]  to produce their product. Some shops describe their product as grown in organic soil or
[05:22.460 --> 05:28.060]  that they use organic growing techniques. Another website touts certification of organic
[05:28.060 --> 05:33.900]  standards and testing that mirrors the U.S. Department of Agriculture organic certification.
[05:33.900 --> 05:37.860]  Brooke Wise, owner of The Growing Kitchen in Boulder, said that she's willing to take
[05:37.860 --> 05:41.960]  the risk of labeling her company's edibles made with certified organic seeds and fruits
[05:41.960 --> 05:47.140]  as organic even if the marijuana in them isn't. It's a principle, an ideology that doesn't
[05:47.140 --> 05:53.580]  belong to anybody, she said, noting her plants would be certified organic if that existed.
[05:53.580 --> 05:58.740]  On the list of sacrifices and gambles I take, organic is definitely on there. But River
[05:58.740 --> 06:02.940]  Rock Cannabis in Denver has backed away from using the term. Until recently, the company
[06:02.940 --> 06:07.700]  had been known as River Rock Organic Medical Cannabis. The attorney general sent something
[06:07.700 --> 06:12.860]  saying that no dispensary can be certified as organic, retail manager Chris Haggerty
[06:12.860 --> 06:16.820]  said. The company changed signs, stopped handing out promotional items with the company's
[06:16.820 --> 06:21.420]  name and even stopped selling t-shirts with the old company name, Haggerty said. A group
[06:21.420 --> 06:26.180]  seeking to have marijuana certifiable as organic said a system for informing consumers how
[06:26.180 --> 06:31.220]  marijuana is grown is needed. The word organic is being used inappropriately by people who
[06:31.220 --> 06:35.940]  are using very toxic chemicals. There's no governing agency that is regulating that,
[06:35.940 --> 06:40.860]  said John Paul Maxfield, co-founder of the Organic Cannabis Association in Denver. In
[06:40.860 --> 06:46.060]  the absence of a body coming through and branding organic cannabis, that term can be used by
[06:46.060 --> 06:51.860]  everybody even if it's not done properly. The USDA accredits companies and state governments
[06:51.860 --> 06:56.940]  to certify any farm as complying with federal organic regulations for agricultural products.
[06:56.940 --> 07:02.420]  No company may use the term without this certification. Marijuana may not be certified organic under
[07:02.420 --> 07:07.740]  the USDA organic regulations, said a USDA spokesman who could not be named because it's
[07:07.740 --> 07:12.340]  the agency's policy when discussing marijuana. Marijuana is considered a controlled substance
[07:12.340 --> 07:17.340]  at the federal level and organic certification is reserved for agricultural products. The
[07:17.340 --> 07:22.820]  USDA's National Organic Program rules say companies with organic in their name cannot
[07:22.820 --> 07:27.540]  prominently display it on a product and cannot use the name at all if it misrepresents that
[07:27.540 --> 07:32.460]  a product has been certified organic. It falls to the Colorado Department of Agriculture
[07:32.460 --> 07:37.640]  to certify and accredit agricultural businesses in the state as organic as well as police
[07:37.640 --> 07:43.680]  for inappropriate and illegal uses of the word on behalf of the USDA. If the state chose
[07:43.680 --> 07:48.880]  to certify marijuana as organic, it would have to ignore federal rules and that's unlikely,
[07:48.880 --> 07:55.000]  said Mitch Yerger, director of CDA's Plant Industry Division. That's weird because we've
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.400]  already ignored federal rules and we have legalized recreational cannabis, so why wouldn't
[07:59.400 --> 08:03.760]  we just do it again? Anyway, that's my opinion on that. The state's inquiry came after the
[08:03.760 --> 08:08.400]  Denver Department of Environmental Health this year quarantined more than 100,000 marijuana
[08:08.400 --> 08:13.600]  plants over pesticide concerns. One company, Organic Greens, tested positive for unapproved
[08:13.600 --> 08:18.360]  pesticides, but because it operates publicly as natural remedies, the Ag's office allowed
[08:18.360 --> 08:23.920]  it to keep its name, said McAllister, its attorney. Their actual corporation name is
[08:23.920 --> 08:29.520]  Organic Greens, but they don't use it in advertising, so they don't publicize themselves as organic.
[08:29.520 --> 08:34.560]  They don't do any advertising as organic, so nobody's being misled, McAllister said,
[08:34.560 --> 08:40.000]  confirming the company name under Ag scrutiny. McAllister said the Ag is focusing, at least
[08:40.000 --> 08:46.720]  in part, on companies that have used pesticides not allowed by the state for use on marijuana.
[08:46.720 --> 08:51.960]  They understand you can't get federal certification for the word organic in marijuana, he said.
[08:51.960 --> 08:57.480]  The Ag's office is not substituting themselves for a certification agency, but if it's clearly
[08:57.480 --> 09:03.080]  not organic, if someone's using Mallet or Eagle 20, they're also looking for those cases.
[09:03.080 --> 09:08.240]  Mallet and Eagle 20 are pesticide trade names whose active ingredients contain chemicals
[09:08.240 --> 09:13.720]  the state has not approved for use on marijuana. I've said this on a previous episode, but
[09:13.720 --> 09:17.880]  I was speaking with somebody from the Department of Agriculture. They actually came to ... I'm
[09:17.880 --> 09:22.320]  the master grower at the Spot Dispensary, so I had to meet with the Department of Agriculture.
[09:22.320 --> 09:28.480]  They sent two reps down to come talk to us. The main rep told me that the main reason
[09:28.480 --> 09:33.520]  that Eagle 20 has been banned from dispensary uses is because if there is a fire and the
[09:33.520 --> 09:39.920]  Eagle 20 burns, the off-gassing turns into cyanide, and the fire department doesn't want
[09:39.920 --> 09:44.360]  to go into a building that is filled with the gas of cyanide.
[09:44.360 --> 09:48.240]  That's mainly why Eagle 20 has been banned. Also, it's completely toxic, but he didn't
[09:48.240 --> 09:51.900]  even seem to care about the toxicity of the product. He just wanted to tell me about it
[09:51.900 --> 09:57.260]  turning into cyanide is why it's been banned from use in commercial grow facilities. I'll
[09:57.260 --> 10:00.620]  keep going with the article. There's one more sentence here left. One more short paragraph.
[10:00.620 --> 10:05.660]  It says, although no chemical pesticide can obtain federal approval for use on cannabis,
[10:05.660 --> 10:09.100]  state agriculture officials have determined which products have labels whose restrictions
[10:09.100 --> 10:16.100]  are so broadly worded that using them on marijuana would not be a violation.
[10:16.100 --> 10:20.620]  They're cracking down on it, you guys. When I first started in the medical marijuana world,
[10:20.620 --> 10:25.300]  I was shopping at a dispensary that had the word organic in it. I knew right away when
[10:25.300 --> 10:29.260]  I looked at the medicine, when I saw how they grew, I knew there was nothing to do with
[10:29.260 --> 10:34.980]  actual organics. They were just trying to use the word organic as a marketing ploy,
[10:34.980 --> 10:36.580]  and it was working.
[10:36.580 --> 10:45.420]  Also, just to put this out there, they do require that all of the ingredients used in
[10:45.420 --> 10:49.820]  the cannabis market, anything that was sprayed or fed to the plants does have to be listed
[10:49.820 --> 10:58.180]  on an ingredients list on the outside of the container. All of that shit does have to be
[10:58.180 --> 11:02.980]  listed on the package that the cannabis or hatch is sold in. Actually, let me reach over
[11:02.980 --> 11:06.820]  here. This is just the inner packaging. This one doesn't have the ingredients on it, sorry.
[11:06.820 --> 11:10.140]  But most of the time, it's got a few things written on it. If you come by cannabis in
[11:10.140 --> 11:14.620]  the state of Colorado, you'll get a little jar, like a childproof jar or whatever they
[11:14.620 --> 11:17.940]  put the cannabis in, and it'll have some ingredients listed on it. You'll see things
[11:17.940 --> 11:23.580]  like calcium, and you'll see things like mycos and beneficial bacteria, and you'll see stuff
[11:23.580 --> 11:28.220]  like that. That's all what was used in the growing of the plant. They will also hopefully
[11:28.220 --> 11:31.820]  list any pesticides that were sprayed on there.
[11:31.820 --> 11:36.060]  They're cracking down on the name organic, and then they are also cracking down to make
[11:36.060 --> 11:40.380]  sure that your shit is organic, which I really appreciate. I really like that because there
[11:40.380 --> 11:43.820]  are a lot of shops serving up doo-doo that you can tell it was not organically grown.
[11:43.820 --> 11:49.820]  You can taste the fertilizers in it. I know friends that own hydro shops, and I know friends
[11:49.820 --> 11:56.020]  that are reps and consultants for dispensaries, and they go to places that claim to be running
[11:56.020 --> 12:00.220]  organics. Then when they make their order from the hydro shop, or when they set up a
[12:00.220 --> 12:04.740]  nutrient schedule with the consultant, they go with the product that is completely not
[12:04.740 --> 12:08.740]  organic and they don't seem to give a shit. But you can't say anything. You just got to
[12:08.740 --> 12:13.540]  let them do their thing. So I'm glad now somebody is going to call them out and make them accountable.
[12:13.900 --> 12:18.460]  All right, I'm going to take a dab and a quick drink, and then we're going to address an
[12:18.460 --> 12:24.100]  email that was sent to us by a listener about something I said in episode number 90. So
[12:24.100 --> 12:26.100]  hang out for a few seconds, and I'll be right back.
[12:26.100 --> 12:29.900]  All right, you guys, I am back. I just wanted to let you know, if you hear a bunch of ruckus
[12:29.900 --> 12:33.420]  in the background there, there are no hostages in my house. There's actually a football game
[12:33.420 --> 12:38.780]  happening right now. There's a Denver Broncos game, and my neighbors are having a party,
[12:38.780 --> 12:41.700]  and I got my window open a little bit. So whenever something happens in the game, you
[12:41.700 --> 12:47.500]  can hear them either cheer or jeer, whichever way it goes. It's pretty entertaining. So
[12:47.500 --> 12:51.140]  if you hear the screams, no, I don't have hostages here in the house. It's just a football
[12:51.140 --> 12:54.760]  game, and people are going crazy.
[12:54.760 --> 12:58.760]  So all right, just a few days ago, I received an email from a friend of ours. Let's get
[12:58.760 --> 13:02.600]  into this email. I'm pulling it up in my phone right now. Here we go. All right, this email
[13:02.600 --> 13:06.840]  is from our friend Justin, and it says, I just listened to episode 90. I guess I was
[13:06.840 --> 13:11.360]  operating on some incorrect information. You and Jesse seem to feel like herms are really
[13:11.420 --> 13:16.480]  bad. I was told herm seeds were pretty much feminized seeds since the genetics all came
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.800]  from females. So basically, we would revege out plants after harvest and then light poison
[13:21.800 --> 13:26.000]  them to make seeds for the future. So I'm wondering if those progeny from the seeds
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.980]  would be predisposed to herm in the future. If you could just explain a little to me or
[13:30.980 --> 13:35.980]  cover this on the show, I would super duper love that. Thanks, Ross DeJeff from Justin
[13:35.980 --> 13:36.980]  G.
[13:37.460 --> 13:42.380]  All right, so the seeds you're talking about are not necessarily herms. Hermaphrodite seeds
[13:42.380 --> 13:47.700]  are different. Hermaphrodite seeds come from when there is a female plant in the room that
[13:47.700 --> 13:53.500]  suddenly pops a male flower, and that male flower pollinates the room, and a few seeds
[13:53.500 --> 13:58.860]  happen from that small pollination. So there's a big difference in kind of a hermaphrodite
[13:58.860 --> 14:02.780]  seed and what you're talking about. I took a few notes and wrote a few things down. I'm
[14:02.780 --> 14:06.340]  going to kind of try to read this to you and sound like I'm not reading something to
[14:06.340 --> 14:12.860]  you. But here's what I wrote. Those seeds that you made are made by stressing the plant.
[14:12.860 --> 14:18.140]  So as long as there were no males or stray pollen available to the females, and also
[14:18.140 --> 14:23.340]  the females are solid females, the seeds produced will be females because of the lack of a Y
[14:23.340 --> 14:29.140]  male chromosome. So technically, those won't be herm seeds if none of the females hermaphrodited
[14:29.140 --> 14:33.820]  and made male flowers that released pollen in there, and they should be feminized. So
[14:33.820 --> 14:37.340]  as long as none of your female plants are throwing off bananas or male pollen sacks,
[14:37.340 --> 14:42.740]  you will be making female seeds here. If a plant is allowed to flower for too long, it'll
[14:42.740 --> 14:47.860]  often make seeds. If a plant is light stressed, which is what you guys are doing, then those
[14:47.860 --> 14:53.820]  plants will make seeds, and those seeds are feminized. Another way to make feminized seeds
[14:53.820 --> 14:58.660]  is Soma takes a plant that is almost finished. It'll be around week six or seven, for like
[14:58.660 --> 15:03.140]  a nine week plant, he'll take it around week six or seven, and then he will light a small
[15:03.140 --> 15:08.300]  fire and put that fire next to the plant to make it feel like it's in a forest fire. He
[15:08.300 --> 15:11.940]  will heat the shit out of the plant. He'll move the heat around the plant and kind of
[15:11.940 --> 15:16.260]  freak it out, and that plant thinks it's in a forest fire. And its panic reaction is to
[15:16.260 --> 15:20.660]  start making seeds. So he'll have to give it four to six weeks from there to finish
[15:20.660 --> 15:27.460]  seeding. But by week 12, Soma will have a big batch of feminized S1 seeds that don't
[15:27.460 --> 15:34.660]  have any other chromosomes in them except the chromosomes coming from that plant. So
[15:34.660 --> 15:40.260]  you're going to be basically copying the plant that you just stressed. So you are making
[15:40.260 --> 15:43.820]  feminized seeds there. When Jesse and I were talking about hermaphrodite seeds, we were
[15:43.820 --> 15:49.820]  talking more about seeds that were caused by a hermaphrodite issue in a room. Say one
[15:49.820 --> 15:55.580]  of your females were to pop a pollen sack during week seven or whatever, or week six
[15:55.580 --> 15:59.500]  or seven, and that hits another plant and it pollinates and it makes a little bit of
[15:59.500 --> 16:04.980]  seed, that seed will be kind of questionable. It may have hermaphroditic traits, but it
[16:04.980 --> 16:09.040]  still could be gold is what we were talking about. So there is a little bit of difference
[16:09.040 --> 16:13.760]  in herm seed and what you're doing. A herm seed is kind of a trait issue. What you're
[16:13.760 --> 16:18.180]  doing is kind of a manipulation, sort of a stressing and a panic reaction sort of a thing.
[16:18.180 --> 16:23.420]  I encourage you to keep doing that. If you got any extra seeds, man, I'd love to grow
[16:23.420 --> 16:28.500]  a couple of those and see what they do. I'll take some pictures for you. So one thing that
[16:28.500 --> 16:31.820]  I do that's kind of on this realm, and this is just because I wanted to rant about this,
[16:31.820 --> 16:36.980]  it's kind of what this reminded me of. Before I breed with plants, I will take my females
[16:36.980 --> 16:40.860]  and I will put them in the flowering room and I will set the timer to 12, 12 and I'll
[16:40.860 --> 16:45.620]  let them flower for about two weeks. And as soon as I see bud set, I will reverse the
[16:45.620 --> 16:52.060]  timer from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. I will now have them off from 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. and they will
[16:52.060 --> 16:57.980]  come on at 9 p.m. till 9 a.m. for about five days. And then after five or six days, I will
[16:57.980 --> 17:02.580]  put the timer back to the original 12, 12. They'll come on at 9 a.m. and go off at 9
[17:02.580 --> 17:06.340]  p.m. and I'll pay real close attention to them for about a week and a half. And then
[17:06.340 --> 17:10.900]  I'll fuck with the timer again. I'll turn it on for 24 hours. Why not? And then I'll
[17:10.900 --> 17:15.420]  just do weird random shit with my schedules in there. And then I'll put it back on 12,
[17:15.420 --> 17:20.180]  12 for a few days and watch the plants. And if they start freaking out real bad, then
[17:20.180 --> 17:25.060]  I kind of get rid of the plants that can't handle some stress. Sometimes I go light stress
[17:25.060 --> 17:28.140]  testing because a little bit will tell me what I want to see. But sometimes you get
[17:28.140 --> 17:32.260]  curious as a grower and you want to go through and really pummel a female plant and see what
[17:32.260 --> 17:36.500]  that bitch can handle before you go putting her into a major breeding project. So I've
[17:36.500 --> 17:41.680]  actually got a couple of plants that I can take them to week two and totally reverse
[17:41.680 --> 17:45.780]  the light cycle and it doesn't piss them off. I can do it a couple of times and they don't
[17:45.780 --> 17:52.140]  hurt him out. However, if I let those same plants go long enough without any light stress,
[17:52.140 --> 17:56.060]  if I let them go too long, they will start to produce seeds because I've let some strains
[17:56.060 --> 18:01.300]  go up to 80 days strains that should only go 60. I've let them go 80 just to see what
[18:01.300 --> 18:04.340]  happens when you grow as much as we do. You end up playing with some things. That's how
[18:04.340 --> 18:09.180]  you learn a lot of shit. I let them go a little bit long just to see what happened. And it
[18:09.180 --> 18:14.620]  was seeded. The plant had by that 20 extra days put seeds in my plant. So you can do
[18:14.620 --> 18:18.060]  it by light stress. You can do it by extending them. There's a lot of different ways to do
[18:18.060 --> 18:23.500]  it. If you're going to stress test your females, I kind of just told you how I would do it.
[18:23.500 --> 18:27.540]  I would just fuck with the light cycles. As a breeder, one thing I want to say is when
[18:27.540 --> 18:31.380]  you grow out those seeds that you're making from manipulated plants, really pay close
[18:31.380 --> 18:36.580]  attention to hermaphroditic traits. You may not find the hermaphrodites until like week
[18:36.580 --> 18:41.260]  eight of a nine week plant or of a 10 week plant. So really pay attention to that. That
[18:41.260 --> 18:46.100]  shouldn't be there, but you are making a manipulated seed that's not natural. So there
[18:46.100 --> 18:50.500]  is a chance for some weirdness. All right. I hope that answered your question in your
[18:50.500 --> 18:55.660]  email. Go ahead and grow those seeds out, man. That's a great way to keep yourself self-sustainable
[18:55.660 --> 19:00.440]  and keep yourself supplied in seeds. You'll be one of those guys that has seeds when the
[19:00.440 --> 19:05.020]  apocalypse comes. So we'll be hanging out. All right, guys, if you want me to read one
[19:05.020 --> 19:09.660]  of your emails on the show, all you got to do is send it to me. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[19:09.660 --> 19:13.500]  I'd love to answer your questions. You know I love the interaction. I'd love you guys
[19:13.500 --> 19:19.340]  to follow me on Twitter. It's at GFYH podcast. Find me on Facebook. It's just growfromyourheart.
[19:19.340 --> 19:22.620]  I love all of the social media interaction. I do try to interact with everybody. If you
[19:22.620 --> 19:27.320]  send me a message, I will try to respond. It does take me a little bit sometimes because
[19:27.320 --> 19:31.860]  I do get a lot of messages. Of course, I've got the iRegenetics email account that fills
[19:31.860 --> 19:36.700]  up. I've got my own personal email account that fills up. Since I've been doing Periscope
[19:36.700 --> 19:41.140]  videos, I've been getting a lot more messages. So things are going a little bit crazy. Facebook,
[19:41.140 --> 19:46.020]  Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff keeps me tied up. And I've been working at the spot
[19:46.020 --> 19:50.580]  doing quite a few hours every week. So that limits my time for social media. But I will
[19:50.580 --> 19:55.180]  answer your question is what I think I am getting to. Please interact with me. I would
[19:55.180 --> 19:59.820]  love it. All right, you guys, I think that's holy crap. What happened to my throat? Jeez.
[19:59.820 --> 20:03.460]  I apologize for that. I think that's all I've got for you for this week. I thought that
[20:03.460 --> 20:06.660]  news article and that email would take a little bit longer to answer. But I pretty much covered
[20:06.660 --> 20:11.140]  that in 20 minutes. So I'm going to wrap up this show. I will be back. I am putting
[20:11.140 --> 20:14.980]  together the episode about CBD. I'm trying to get more guests to come be on the show
[20:14.980 --> 20:18.820]  now that it's almost harvest season, you guys. So once everybody cuts down, everybody will
[20:18.820 --> 20:22.420]  be a little bit more available. We'll be able to get all the growers back on the show. I
[20:22.420 --> 20:26.980]  got the Zoom H6. So I'll be able to take the show on the road now. We'll go a few places.
[20:26.980 --> 20:30.800]  I just bought four microphones and four new cables. We'll be able to take that wherever
[20:30.800 --> 20:33.900]  we want and go do some recording with a lot more people. That's going to open up a lot
[20:33.900 --> 20:41.180]  more options. On the next episode, I plan to answer another email that we got. I want
[20:41.180 --> 20:47.480]  to address something that I saw at a grower's house when I went to do a consultation. Something
[20:47.480 --> 20:51.700]  that they did in their garden that I felt the urge to correct them. And I kind of gave
[20:51.700 --> 20:54.660]  them some guidance on it. So I'm going to share that with you guys. You might be making
[20:54.660 --> 20:59.280]  the same mistakes as this other guy. So I'm going to share that with you. I've got a lot
[20:59.280 --> 21:03.920]  of great stuff planned. You guys, I'll be back Monday with another episode. I want to
[21:03.920 --> 21:08.360]  thank you guys for joining me. We don't have any sponsors. If you want to sponsor the podcast,

[22:28.520 --> 22:32.200]  now that the show's over, you can go to iTunes. Search for the iTunes or go to the iTunes
[22:32.200 --> 22:35.720]  store. Search for Grow From Your Heart. Find the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Leave me
[22:35.720 --> 22:40.200]  a five-star review and type in a little comment and let me know what you think about the podcast.
[22:40.200 --> 22:45.080]  I will read your comments on a future episode. The reason that we want more ratings and more
[22:45.080 --> 22:49.640]  comments and more reviews is because that makes us more exposed to a larger audience.
[22:49.640 --> 22:52.840]  The more likes you get, the more comments you get, the more Facebook shares you and
[22:52.840 --> 22:57.240]  exposes you. So, the more people that see the show, the more people will learn how to grow
[22:57.240 --> 23:02.600]  quality cannabis. More people will quit spraying shit on their plants. People will learn how to
[23:02.600 --> 23:07.880]  look out for hermaphrodites. People will learn how to just grow better cannabis overall. Everybody
[23:07.880 --> 23:12.040]  will grow cannabis. People will get the right idea. They will get a proper education. Maybe
[23:12.040 --> 23:16.120]  somebody will listen to the show that has never smoked pot before. They'll listen to the show and
[23:16.120 --> 23:20.840]  they'll say, you know what? This guy smokes a gram of hash every single day and he's mostly
[23:20.840 --> 23:25.400]  articulate. I know I've got some stoner moments on this show, but that's just me. But I'm mostly
[23:25.400 --> 23:29.880]  articulate. Maybe they'll say, this guy has his shit together. Maybe weed isn't so bad.
[23:29.880 --> 23:33.880]  And then maybe they'll lighten up and then maybe they'll be on our side. And then maybe one day,
[23:33.880 --> 23:40.520]  we can legalize cannabis nationwide and then worldwide. That's my mission. Legalizing cannabis
[23:40.520 --> 23:43.800]  one click at a time here at the Grow From Your Heart Podcast. That's what we are doing.
[23:44.600 --> 23:47.880]  All right, you guys. I don't have a lot else to say, so I am going to wrap up the show.
[23:49.160 --> 23:55.480]  Yeah, follow me on Instagram, you guys. I just hit 18,000 followers. I'm at 18.1k on Instagram
[23:55.480 --> 23:59.800]  right now. Find me. It's at I read genetics on Instagram. You guys, I want to give a huge shout
[23:59.800 --> 24:04.840]  out to my ninja spence. Thanks again for listening. Until next time, take a big fat dab, not just a
[24:04.840 --> 24:09.240]  little dab, you guys, like a big one, like a half a gram. Make it count. You ready? Get it on the
[24:09.240 --> 24:39.230]  dabber. I take a fat dab right after you blow it out. Go give your mom a hug for me.
[24:51.390 --> 24:52.270]  Make you feel
[24:52.270 --> 24:54.270]  I

[24:58.270 --> 25:00.270]  If you know the mood and the vibe is right
[25:00.270 --> 25:02.270]  Pass me the chalice
[25:02.270 --> 25:04.270]  make me cage it bright
[25:04.270 --> 25:06.270]  Light it up and come and make
[25:06.270 --> 25:08.270]  me burn it all night
[25:08.270 --> 25:10.270]  No put up no fire
[25:10.270 --> 25:12.270]  See I am I
[25:12.270 --> 25:14.270]  Comfy I'd be keeping with ya
[25:14.270 --> 25:16.270]  Don't we know you
[25:16.270 --> 25:18.270]  love to burn down the fields
[25:18.270 --> 25:20.270]  I saw we love the sense
[25:21.150 --> 25:23.150]  of me
[25:23.150 --> 25:25.150]  And you

[26:12.230 --> 26:14.230]  We love it when we fly over to Amsterdam
[26:14.230 --> 26:16.230]  We see the people burning
[26:16.230 --> 26:18.230]  the earth so free
[26:18.230 --> 26:20.230]  And now they worry about police
[26:20.230 --> 26:25.550]  I'd rather burn this sweet
[26:25.550 --> 26:27.550]  Can't you heard in the coffee shop on the corner
[26:28.430 --> 26:30.430]  It's time they realize
[26:30.430 --> 26:32.430]  It should be legalized

[27:57.050 --> 27:59.050]  I can't even speak today
[27:59.050 --> 28:01.050]  I'm coming to you on a lovely Thursday
[28:01.050 --> 28:03.050]  It's a bonus Thursday episode
[28:03.050 --> 28:05.050]  You guys why not put out a Thursday episode
[28:05.050 --> 28:07.050]  I know the Monday episode was pretty short
[28:07.050 --> 28:09.050]  Right after I put out the Monday episode
[28:09.050 --> 28:11.050]  Right after I recorded the Monday episode
[28:11.050 --> 28:13.050]  I went to go look at the news
[28:13.050 --> 28:15.050]  And there was another news article that I feel like you guys need to know about
[28:15.050 --> 28:17.050]  So on this episode it's going to be a quickie
[28:17.050 --> 28:19.050]  Just going to be a midweek quickie
[28:19.050 --> 28:21.050]  A Thursday bonus episode
[28:21.050 --> 28:23.050]  I hope you guys enjoy it
[28:23.050 --> 28:25.050]  But I want to talk about a news article
[28:25.930 --> 28:27.930]  I'm going to try to give you a little bit of guidance
[28:27.930 --> 28:29.930]  And help you improve something
[28:29.930 --> 28:31.930]  So let's get into this news article
[28:31.930 --> 28:33.930]  That made me want to record
[28:33.930 --> 28:35.930]  This one says Denver issues two more pot recalls
[28:35.930 --> 28:37.930]  Of pot containing unapproved pesticides
[28:37.930 --> 28:39.930]  They are at it again
[28:39.930 --> 28:41.930]  You guys
[28:41.930 --> 28:43.930]  This article comes from the cannabis and it is written by our friends
[28:43.930 --> 28:45.930]  David Magoya and Ricardo Baca
[28:45.930 --> 28:47.930]  So let's get right down to bidness
[28:47.930 --> 28:49.930]  Here we go
[28:49.930 --> 28:51.930]  Owners of two Denver marijuana growing facilities
[28:51.930 --> 28:53.930]  On Friday said they were voluntarily
[28:54.810 --> 28:56.810]  Recalling their products
[28:56.810 --> 28:58.810]  After city health officials learned tests found unapproved pesticides
[28:58.810 --> 29:00.810]  The recall of an undisclosed amount of plants
[29:00.810 --> 29:02.810]  And edible products
[29:02.810 --> 29:04.810]  Is the second issued by the Denver Department of Environmental Health
[29:04.810 --> 29:06.810]  In just over a week
[29:06.810 --> 29:08.810]  Underscoring the city's enforcement efforts
[29:08.810 --> 29:10.810]  On companies allegedly using
[29:10.810 --> 29:12.810]  Disallowed chemicals
[29:12.810 --> 29:14.810]  Department officials said retailers should either
[29:14.810 --> 29:16.810]  Destroy the recalled products or return them to the manufacturer
[29:16.810 --> 29:18.810]  Consumers who have had the products
[29:18.810 --> 29:20.810]  Consumers who have the products
[29:20.810 --> 29:22.810]  Should return them to the store of purchase
[29:23.690 --> 29:25.690]  Or dispose of them
[29:25.690 --> 29:27.690]  Take them back
[29:27.690 --> 29:29.690]  Owners of the two impacted businesses
[29:29.690 --> 29:31.690]  Summit Wellness
[29:31.690 --> 29:33.690]  Which operates as Denver Rec
[29:33.690 --> 29:35.690]  And Sacred Seed
[29:35.690 --> 29:37.690]  Confirmed they were removing products
[29:37.690 --> 29:39.690]  From their store shelves
[29:39.690 --> 29:41.690]  It's true
[29:41.690 --> 29:43.690]  Denver Rec owner James Monaco
[29:43.690 --> 29:45.690]  Told the Denver Post about the recall
[29:45.690 --> 29:47.690]  We're working through the process
[29:47.690 --> 29:49.690]  And we'll have a statement on our Twitter feed later tonight
[29:49.690 --> 29:51.690]  The Sacred Seed recall apparently
[29:52.570 --> 29:54.570]  Was the result of pesticides a rogue employee
[29:54.570 --> 29:56.570]  Secretly applied in the middle of the night without permission
[29:56.570 --> 29:58.570]  CEO Jeremy Kilbourne told the Post
[29:58.570 --> 30:00.570]  Now is that just an excuse you guys
[30:00.570 --> 30:02.570]  Or do you think that that really happened
[30:02.570 --> 30:04.570]  Do you think they really had a rogue employee
[30:04.570 --> 30:06.570]  Go in the grow rooms in the middle of the night
[30:06.570 --> 30:08.570]  And spray pesticides
[30:08.570 --> 30:10.570]  Now that pesticide had to be in the damn building
[30:10.570 --> 30:12.570]  For that dude to put in the sprayer
[30:12.570 --> 30:14.570]  It means he had to go to the store
[30:14.570 --> 30:16.570]  He had to buy a pesticide
[30:16.570 --> 30:18.570]  He had to drive to work
[30:18.570 --> 30:20.570]  He had to wait for everybody else to leave
[30:21.450 --> 30:23.450]  I'm not gonna call them out and say bullshit
[30:23.450 --> 30:25.450]  But I might say that I'm not completely sure
[30:25.450 --> 30:27.450]  I completely buy that whole story
[30:27.450 --> 30:29.450]  Because how would they know
[30:29.450 --> 30:31.450]  That a rogue employee did that
[30:31.450 --> 30:33.450]  If nobody ever said anything
[30:33.450 --> 30:35.450]  Until the shit was tested
[30:35.450 --> 30:37.450]  And found spray on it
[30:37.450 --> 30:39.450]  Like did they just go
[30:39.450 --> 30:41.450]  Oh yeah that was that time that guy did that
[30:41.450 --> 30:43.450]  They didn't know that
[30:43.450 --> 30:45.450]  I feel like they just made that up
[30:45.450 --> 30:47.450]  The more I talk about it the more I feel like
[30:47.450 --> 30:49.450]  They are just using that as a cop out
[30:50.330 --> 30:52.330]  The next paragraph lists
[30:52.330 --> 30:54.330]  All of the origin RMCF numbers
[30:54.330 --> 30:56.330]  On all of the products that are recalled
[30:56.330 --> 30:58.330]  Because I don't feel the need to read all of these numbers
[30:58.330 --> 31:00.330]  90% of my audience is not in Colorado anyway
[31:00.330 --> 31:02.330]  So most of you guys don't have any of these products
[31:02.330 --> 31:04.330]  If you bought Mahatma products
[31:04.330 --> 31:06.330]  You may want to contact the dispensary
[31:06.330 --> 31:08.330]  Where you got them
[31:08.330 --> 31:10.330]  And you may want to get a refund
[31:10.330 --> 31:12.330]  So I'm going to continue
[31:12.330 --> 31:14.330]  It says
[31:14.330 --> 31:16.330]  As in the city's prior marijuana recall
[31:16.330 --> 31:18.330]  Returned products cannot be sold
[31:19.210 --> 31:21.210]  The businesses also have the discretion
[31:21.210 --> 31:23.210]  To destroy them
[31:23.210 --> 31:25.210]  We're in a state of shock
[31:25.210 --> 31:27.210]  We pulled everything off of our shelves
[31:27.210 --> 31:29.210]  Self quarantined our grow and our product
[31:29.210 --> 31:31.210]  We don't wholesale
[31:31.210 --> 31:33.210]  So no one has our product out there
[31:33.210 --> 31:35.210]  Except the small amount of trim for processing
[31:35.210 --> 31:37.210]  The products subject to the recall
[31:37.210 --> 31:39.210]  Had been tested at Mahatma concentrates
[31:39.210 --> 31:41.210]  In Denver
[31:41.210 --> 31:43.210]  Which was already under a recall
[31:43.210 --> 31:45.210]  Issued September 8th for its own products
[31:45.210 --> 31:47.210]  That had tested positive for pesticides
[31:48.090 --> 31:50.090]  The city's inquiry at Mahatma
[31:50.090 --> 31:52.090]  Extended to several businesses
[31:52.090 --> 31:54.090]  That send marijuana trimmings
[31:54.090 --> 31:56.090]  For processing into edible concentrates
[31:56.090 --> 31:58.090]  Such as wax and shatter
[31:58.090 --> 32:00.090]  Which are then returned or distributed
[32:00.090 --> 32:02.090]  To different stores
[32:02.090 --> 32:04.090]  As a result of the first recall
[32:04.090 --> 32:06.090]  Mahatma began pesticide testing
[32:06.090 --> 32:08.090]  On all marijuana trimmings that arrive
[32:08.090 --> 32:10.090]  In its Denver facility
[32:10.090 --> 32:12.090]  It was that testing that found pesticides
[32:12.090 --> 32:14.090]  In the latest recalled products
[32:14.090 --> 32:16.090]  Gilborn said Mahatma informed him of the test results
[32:16.970 --> 32:18.970]  And the company immediately contacted officials
[32:18.970 --> 32:20.970]  At the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division
[32:20.970 --> 32:22.970]  We're going to be getting it tested
[32:22.970 --> 32:24.970]  And figuring out the extent of damage
[32:24.970 --> 32:26.970]  And destroying materials or throwing it out
[32:26.970 --> 32:28.970]  However environmental health wants us to do
[32:28.970 --> 32:30.970]  Gilborn said
[32:30.970 --> 32:32.970]  We're reeling right now
[32:32.970 --> 32:34.970]  Gilborn said
[32:34.970 --> 32:36.970]  The Sacred Seed employee responsible
[32:36.970 --> 32:38.970]  For the pesticide misuse had left on Tuesday
[32:38.970 --> 32:40.970]  And offered an explanation in a resignation letter
[32:40.970 --> 32:42.970]  He said
[32:42.970 --> 32:44.970]  I'm so sorry we had a minor bug problem
[32:45.850 --> 32:47.850]  We were going to lose the crop
[32:47.850 --> 32:49.850]  Not only did we tell him not to use those pesticides
[32:49.850 --> 32:51.850]  We had sent him and two others
[32:51.850 --> 32:53.850]  To specialized pesticide handlers training
[32:53.850 --> 32:55.850]  Through the Colorado Department of Agriculture
[32:55.850 --> 32:57.850]  It was unclear how Den Rec learned of the test results
[32:57.850 --> 32:59.850]  Denver inspectors said they only found application logbooks
[32:59.850 --> 33:01.850]  For the past 30 days at Den Rec
[33:01.850 --> 33:03.850]  And the business said older ones had been destroyed
[33:03.850 --> 33:05.850]  Reports show
[33:05.850 --> 33:07.850]  This is weird
[33:07.850 --> 33:09.850]  A letter of resignation
[33:09.850 --> 33:11.850]  From a company that was in the news
[33:11.850 --> 33:13.850]  And then a letter of resignation
[33:14.730 --> 33:16.730]  With an apology
[33:16.730 --> 33:18.730]  And destroyed evidence
[33:18.730 --> 33:20.730]  This is turning into a cannabis soap opera
[33:20.730 --> 33:22.730]  This is kind of neat
[33:22.730 --> 33:24.730]  The CDA issued a list earlier this year
[33:24.730 --> 33:26.730]  Of products it says can be used on marijuana
[33:26.730 --> 33:28.730]  Because the drug is illegal under federal law
[33:28.730 --> 33:30.730]  No pesticide is specifically approved for use on cannabis
[33:30.730 --> 33:32.730]  But some label restrictions are so broadly written
[33:32.730 --> 33:34.730]  That using the chemical would not violate them
[33:34.730 --> 33:36.730]  Federal law mandates
[33:36.730 --> 33:38.730]  That no pesticide may be used
[33:38.730 --> 33:40.730]  In a manner that is not consistent with its label
[33:40.730 --> 33:42.730]  Most marijuana growers are not well informed
[33:43.610 --> 33:45.610]  About pesticide use and the rules behind them
[33:45.610 --> 33:47.610]  CDA officials have said
[33:47.610 --> 33:49.610]  So what appears to solve a problem in a greenhouse
[33:49.610 --> 33:51.610]  Could actually be a violation of law
[33:51.610 --> 33:53.610]  Pesticides are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
[33:53.610 --> 33:55.610]  And it offers no information about marijuana
[33:55.610 --> 33:57.610]  Because the drug is illegal
[33:57.610 --> 33:59.610]  So now we are not able to test pesticides on cannabis
[33:59.610 --> 34:01.610]  To find out the long term effect
[34:01.610 --> 34:03.610]  To find out how long that product stays in the cannabis
[34:03.610 --> 34:05.610]  To find out how much of it actually makes it to the concentration
[34:05.610 --> 34:07.610]  To find out how long that product stays in the cannabis
[34:07.610 --> 34:09.610]  To find out how much of it actually makes it to the concentration
[34:09.610 --> 34:11.610]  To find out how much of it actually makes it to the concentration
[34:12.490 --> 34:14.490]  It's illegal to test these pesticides on cannabis
[34:14.490 --> 34:16.490]  In the way that we need to do it
[34:16.490 --> 34:18.490]  To find what combats our problems
[34:18.490 --> 34:20.490]  Because cannabis is federally illegal
[34:20.490 --> 34:22.490]  Because cannabis is federally illegal
[34:22.490 --> 34:24.490]  I'm sure you guys know where I'm headed with this
[34:24.490 --> 34:26.490]  The solution to this problem
[34:26.490 --> 34:28.490]  I'm sure you guys all want to say it with me
[34:28.490 --> 34:30.490]  Legalize cannabis
[34:30.490 --> 34:32.490]  Then we can test this shit properly
[34:32.490 --> 34:34.490]  And we'll solve this problem
[34:34.490 --> 34:36.490]  Just legalize it
[34:36.490 --> 34:38.490]  They could make money off of
[34:38.490 --> 34:40.490]  The testing labs would make money
[34:41.370 --> 34:43.370]  There are more products being recalled
[34:43.370 --> 34:45.370]  Because of pesticides
[34:45.370 --> 34:47.370]  Mahatma concentrates has actually taken it upon themselves
[34:47.370 --> 34:49.370]  To start testing everything that comes in
[34:49.370 --> 34:51.370]  Before they run it
[34:51.370 --> 34:53.370]  Before they do the extraction process
[34:53.370 --> 34:55.370]  They are testing all of the material that comes in
[34:55.370 --> 34:57.370]  I give kudos to Mahatma
[34:57.370 --> 34:59.370]  That is a bold step
[34:59.370 --> 35:01.370]  And that is a brave thing to do
[35:01.370 --> 35:03.370]  They have to pay for the testing which costs money
[35:03.370 --> 35:05.370]  And they are also going to lose clientele
[35:05.370 --> 35:07.370]  Because anything that does come back with the contaminant
[35:07.370 --> 35:09.370]  And it cannot be ran
[35:10.250 --> 35:12.250]  Big shout out to Mahatma
[35:12.250 --> 35:14.250]  If you are coming to Colorado to buy products
[35:14.250 --> 35:16.250]  I want you to feel safe
[35:16.250 --> 35:18.250]  And this is what we are doing to make you feel safe
[35:18.250 --> 35:20.250]  We are making sure there are not ridiculous pesticides in here
[35:20.250 --> 35:22.250]  And they mentioned that
[35:22.250 --> 35:24.250]  Department of Agriculture
[35:24.250 --> 35:26.250]  Applicators training
[35:26.250 --> 35:28.250]  Course in this article
[35:28.250 --> 35:30.250]  If you are growing cannabis
[35:30.250 --> 35:32.250]  I recommend that you go and read
[35:32.250 --> 35:34.250]  Your states
[35:34.250 --> 35:36.250]  Pesticide applicators training manual
[35:36.250 --> 35:38.250]  Or certification manual
[35:39.130 --> 35:41.130]  It varies state by state
[35:41.130 --> 35:43.130]  But your department of agriculture
[35:43.130 --> 35:45.130]  Will have an applicators
[35:45.130 --> 35:47.130]  Training guide
[35:47.130 --> 35:49.130]  Or certification guide
[35:49.130 --> 35:51.130]  Go read it
[35:51.130 --> 35:53.130]  You will learn so much about pesticides
[35:53.130 --> 35:55.130]  About pesticide use
[35:55.130 --> 35:57.130]  About pesticide safety
[35:57.130 --> 35:59.130]  You will learn that most of these products
[35:59.130 --> 36:01.130]  Are all derived from the same thing
[36:01.130 --> 36:03.130]  And they are mixed with other carrier agents
[36:03.130 --> 36:05.130]  And that alone will be a useful tool
[36:05.130 --> 36:07.130]  In your ganja growing arsenal
[36:08.010 --> 36:10.010]  I have a future plan on doing an integrated pest management episode
[36:10.010 --> 36:12.010]  I have two people lined up
[36:12.010 --> 36:14.010]  That I want to have on that show
[36:14.010 --> 36:16.010]  And getting them here at the same time has been a challenge
[36:16.010 --> 36:18.010]  I may just do two separate episodes
[36:18.010 --> 36:20.010]  And get them both on separate episodes
[36:20.010 --> 36:22.010]  That was the news article that I wanted to read
[36:22.010 --> 36:24.010]  I want to keep you guys updated on what is going on here in Denver
[36:24.010 --> 36:26.010]  Or up in Denver
[36:26.010 --> 36:28.010]  I am not in Denver
[36:28.010 --> 36:30.010]  I am about 100 miles south of Denver
[36:30.010 --> 36:32.010]  I want to keep you updated on what is going on
[36:32.010 --> 36:34.010]  Let you know how this pesticide drama
[36:34.010 --> 36:36.010]  Has been going
[36:36.890 --> 36:38.890]  I wanted to give props to Mahatma Concentrates
[36:38.890 --> 36:40.890]  For stepping up their game
[36:40.890 --> 36:42.890]  They are testing everything now
[36:42.890 --> 36:44.890]  They found out they had a problem
[36:44.890 --> 36:46.890]  Instead of trying to hide it
[36:46.890 --> 36:48.890]  They are like hey we fucked up
[36:48.890 --> 36:50.890]  And look what we are going to do
[36:50.890 --> 36:52.890]  We are going to test everything
[36:52.890 --> 36:54.890]  It is going to make a lot of people accountable
[36:54.890 --> 36:56.890]  And I like the way this industry is moving
[36:56.890 --> 36:58.890]  I do want to talk about one more thing
[36:58.890 --> 37:00.890]  This is just going to be a short episode
[37:00.890 --> 37:02.890]  This is just a bonus Thursday episode
[37:02.890 --> 37:04.890]  I wanted to get that news article out
[37:05.770 --> 37:07.770]  I saw a few days ago
[37:07.770 --> 37:09.770]  While I was at a consultation
[37:09.770 --> 37:11.770]  A lot of times when I go to a consultation
[37:11.770 --> 37:13.770]  People will have a problem that they need corrected
[37:13.770 --> 37:15.770]  But sometimes they just want me to
[37:15.770 --> 37:17.770]  Observe what they are doing
[37:17.770 --> 37:19.770]  And see what we can improve or make easier for them
[37:19.770 --> 37:21.770]  That will make their cannabis crop come out a little bit better
[37:21.770 --> 37:23.770]  So I want to tell you guys
[37:23.770 --> 37:25.770]  A little something about what I saw
[37:25.770 --> 37:27.770]  At a consultation
[37:27.770 --> 37:29.770]  With a client a few days ago
[37:29.770 --> 37:31.770]  And I just want to kind of correct this
[37:31.770 --> 37:33.770]  And I don't know if you are doing this wrong
[37:34.650 --> 37:36.650]  I am sure there are a couple people out there
[37:36.650 --> 37:38.650]  Who will benefit from this
[37:38.650 --> 37:40.650]  I was just watching this guy work in his garden
[37:40.650 --> 37:42.650]  I just showed up
[37:42.650 --> 37:44.650]  At his house
[37:44.650 --> 37:46.650]  I was like what's up man
[37:46.650 --> 37:48.650]  I know you need help
[37:48.650 --> 37:50.650]  Let's go check it out
[37:50.650 --> 37:52.650]  And we walked out there and he said
[37:52.650 --> 37:54.650]  I saved all my chores for when you got here
[37:54.650 --> 37:56.650]  And we are just going to do my gardening
[37:56.650 --> 37:58.650]  And I was like that sounds great
[37:58.650 --> 38:00.650]  So I helped him out
[38:00.650 --> 38:02.650]  I filled some buckets
[38:03.530 --> 38:05.530]  And he pours all of the nutrients
[38:05.530 --> 38:07.530]  Into the 5 gallon bucket
[38:07.530 --> 38:09.530]  You guys you cannot do that
[38:09.530 --> 38:11.530]  I will explain why
[38:11.530 --> 38:13.530]  I am not a scientist but I know why
[38:13.530 --> 38:15.530]  The reason that they are sold
[38:15.530 --> 38:17.530]  In different bottles
[38:17.530 --> 38:19.530]  I am just going to use advanced nutrients
[38:19.530 --> 38:21.530]  Because it is the product that popped up in my mind
[38:21.530 --> 38:23.530]  They have got a flower A
[38:23.530 --> 38:25.530]  They have got a flower B
[38:25.530 --> 38:27.530]  And then there is like a bloom booster
[38:27.530 --> 38:29.530]  And then there is like a flavor booster
[38:29.530 --> 38:31.530]  Advanced nutrients has so many bottles
[38:32.410 --> 38:34.410]  The reason those are all sold separately
[38:34.410 --> 38:36.410]  Is because if they put those products
[38:36.410 --> 38:38.410]  All into one container
[38:38.410 --> 38:40.410]  The elements in there
[38:40.410 --> 38:42.410]  Will bond
[38:42.410 --> 38:44.410]  That is why we need to add those products
[38:44.410 --> 38:46.410]  To water and never mix them together
[38:46.410 --> 38:48.410]  Concentrated
[38:48.410 --> 38:50.410]  Those are very concentrated products
[38:50.410 --> 38:52.410]  You are only adding a few milliliters to 5 gallons of water
[38:52.410 --> 38:54.410]  So the first thing I am going to say
[38:54.410 --> 38:56.410]  Is fill up your container that you are going to mix
[38:56.410 --> 38:58.410]  Into probably a 5 gallon bucket
[38:58.410 --> 39:00.410]  Fill that with water first
[39:01.290 --> 39:03.290]  Reverse osmosis water
[39:03.290 --> 39:05.290]  But we cannot all do that
[39:05.290 --> 39:07.290]  So fill your 5 gallon bucket with water
[39:07.290 --> 39:09.290]  Always fill it with water first
[39:09.290 --> 39:11.290]  Then add the nutrients to the water
[39:11.290 --> 39:13.290]  Never mix nutrients without water
[39:13.290 --> 39:15.290]  They are buffered
[39:15.290 --> 39:17.290]  They are sold separately for a reason
[39:17.290 --> 39:19.290]  They are buffered and chelated
[39:19.290 --> 39:21.290]  And they are not meant to be mixed
[39:21.290 --> 39:23.290]  In concentrate together
[39:23.290 --> 39:25.290]  So the best I can recommend
[39:25.290 --> 39:27.290]  Is to either mix them into a 1 gallon pitcher
[39:27.290 --> 39:29.290]  So that if you do make a mistake
[39:30.170 --> 39:32.170]  You can mix the nutrients one at a time
[39:32.170 --> 39:34.170]  Into your 5 gallon bucket
[39:34.170 --> 39:36.170]  But never pour them in concentrate form
[39:36.170 --> 39:38.170]  Into a container together
[39:38.170 --> 39:40.170]  That is not a good thing
[39:40.170 --> 39:42.170]  You are causing problems already
[39:42.170 --> 39:44.170]  So fill your bucket
[39:44.170 --> 39:46.170]  Get a pitcher of water from that bucket
[39:46.170 --> 39:48.170]  Mix your nutrient solution into the pitcher
[39:48.170 --> 39:50.170]  Use a quality measuring device
[39:50.170 --> 39:52.170]  Go get something from the grocery store
[39:52.170 --> 39:54.170]  Or a scientific store
[39:54.170 --> 39:56.170]  The stuff you use for your kitchen is close
[39:56.170 --> 39:58.170]  But it is not going to be as accurate
[39:59.050 --> 40:01.050]  You can't use the same stuff
[40:01.050 --> 40:03.050]  You need a dedicated one
[40:03.050 --> 40:05.050]  You don't want to be mixing
[40:05.050 --> 40:07.050]  Your food
[40:07.050 --> 40:09.050]  You don't want to be measuring
[40:09.050 --> 40:11.050]  Your vanilla extract
[40:11.050 --> 40:13.050]  That is tacky
[40:13.050 --> 40:15.050]  And unsanitary
[40:15.050 --> 40:17.050]  It is going to get you sick
[40:17.050 --> 40:19.050]  Or your plants sick
[40:19.050 --> 40:21.050]  So measure carefully
[40:21.050 --> 40:23.050]  Be accurate with your measurements
[40:23.050 --> 40:25.050]  If it says 25 ml
[40:25.050 --> 40:27.050]  If the bottle says 50 ml
[40:27.930 --> 40:29.930]  Use half of that
[40:29.930 --> 40:31.930]  I have never needed to use as much
[40:31.930 --> 40:33.930]  As recommended on the bottle
[40:33.930 --> 40:35.930]  The nutrient companies want you to buy more
[40:35.930 --> 40:37.930]  They recommend you use a little bit extra
[40:37.930 --> 40:39.930]  So you don't always have to use as much as it says
[40:39.930 --> 40:41.930]  Start with maybe a half, two thirds
[40:41.930 --> 40:43.930]  And work your way up from there
[40:43.930 --> 40:45.930]  But measure carefully
[40:45.930 --> 40:47.930]  If you are trying to put in 25 ml
[40:47.930 --> 40:49.930]  Measure 25 ml
[40:49.930 --> 40:51.930]  Write it down
[40:51.930 --> 40:53.930]  So if something goes wrong
[40:53.930 --> 40:55.930]  You know next time that 26 or 27 isn't what you did
[40:56.810 --> 40:58.810]  The 25 is your number to go to next time
[40:58.810 --> 41:00.810]  So measure carefully
[41:00.810 --> 41:02.810]  Take notes all the time
[41:02.810 --> 41:04.810]  I should always remind you to take notes
[41:04.810 --> 41:06.810]  Always take notes when you are growing cannabis
[41:06.810 --> 41:08.810]  It is the only way you know what you did
[41:08.810 --> 41:10.810]  Or what you didn't do
[41:10.810 --> 41:12.810]  I know you are going to think
[41:12.810 --> 41:14.810]  I'll remember doing that
[41:14.810 --> 41:16.810]  You are growing cannabis which means you are smoking cannabis
[41:16.810 --> 41:18.810]  Which means you are going to forget
[41:18.810 --> 41:20.810]  So write that shit down
[41:20.810 --> 41:22.810]  Now you have everything measured
[41:22.810 --> 41:24.810]  You have taken a pitcher of water
[41:25.690 --> 41:27.690]  Dump that into the pitcher
[41:27.690 --> 41:29.690]  Pour B into the measuring device
[41:29.690 --> 41:31.690]  All your additives
[41:31.690 --> 41:33.690]  Put that into there
[41:33.690 --> 41:35.690]  Then clean out your measuring device
[41:35.690 --> 41:37.690]  Go clean it right now
[41:37.690 --> 41:39.690]  Before you do anything else
[41:39.690 --> 41:41.690]  Dump that pitcher into your 5 gallon bucket
[41:41.690 --> 41:43.690]  With water in there
[41:43.690 --> 41:45.690]  So now you have 5 gallons of perfectly mixed water
[41:45.690 --> 41:47.690]  If you do make a mistake
[41:47.690 --> 41:49.690]  All you have to do is dump out that pitcher
[41:49.690 --> 41:51.690]  And start fresh
[41:51.690 --> 41:53.690]  You wasted your nutrients
[41:54.570 --> 41:56.570]  You don't have to wait for a 5 gallon bucket to refill
[41:56.570 --> 41:58.570]  If you are using reverse osmosis water
[41:58.570 --> 42:00.570]  You just saved even more
[42:00.570 --> 42:02.570]  Because when you make reverse osmosis water
[42:02.570 --> 42:04.570]  There is a lot of water that gets thrown away
[42:04.570 --> 42:06.570]  So it is hard to waste water
[42:06.570 --> 42:08.570]  When you are using reverse osmosis water
[42:08.570 --> 42:10.570]  Let's see
[42:10.570 --> 42:12.570]  So now you have your bucket
[42:12.570 --> 42:14.570]  It is filled with your nutrient solution
[42:14.570 --> 42:16.570]  It is filled with water
[42:16.570 --> 42:18.570]  Now it is time to test the pH
[42:18.570 --> 42:20.570]  I have seen people adjust the pH of their water
[42:20.570 --> 42:22.570]  Before they add the nutrients
[42:23.450 --> 42:25.450]  So you are going to pH it and then put shit in it
[42:25.450 --> 42:27.450]  So once you have all of your nutrients in there
[42:27.450 --> 42:29.450]  Every single nutrient
[42:29.450 --> 42:31.450]  That is when you adjust the pH
[42:31.450 --> 42:33.450]  Use pH up or pH down to correct it
[42:33.450 --> 42:35.450]  Write it down
[42:35.450 --> 42:37.450]  Write down the pH
[42:37.450 --> 42:39.450]  If you get it at 6.5 write it down
[42:39.450 --> 42:41.450]  If you get it at 6.3 write that down
[42:41.450 --> 42:43.450]  If it is 6.7 write it down
[42:43.450 --> 42:45.450]  If you are in hydro you are going lower
[42:45.450 --> 42:47.450]  Still write it the fuck down
[42:47.450 --> 42:49.450]  So that when you see those plants doing something
[42:49.450 --> 42:51.450]  You know if you were right or wrong
[42:52.330 --> 42:54.330]  With your measurement
[42:54.330 --> 42:56.330]  And you have a reference for where to go to next time
[42:56.330 --> 42:58.330]  You can't make adjustments if you don't know what you did last time
[42:58.330 --> 43:00.330]  So now we have got our nutrients mixed up
[43:00.330 --> 43:02.330]  In a 5 gallon bucket
[43:02.330 --> 43:04.330]  We have got it properly pH'ed to about 6.5
[43:04.330 --> 43:06.330]  We wrote that down
[43:06.330 --> 43:08.330]  We wrote down how much nutrients we have used
[43:08.330 --> 43:10.330]  Now it is time to water each plant
[43:10.330 --> 43:12.330]  You guys when you go watering the plants
[43:12.330 --> 43:14.330]  This is something that I saw my client do the other day
[43:14.330 --> 43:16.330]  He poured the water directly in the center of the pot
[43:16.330 --> 43:18.330]  Right over the stalk
[43:18.330 --> 43:20.330]  Right into the plant
[43:21.210 --> 43:23.210]  If you are using enough water
[43:23.210 --> 43:25.210]  That will work
[43:25.210 --> 43:27.210]  But here is what I would recommend
[43:27.210 --> 43:29.210]  It is wiser and more healthy for the plant
[43:29.210 --> 43:31.210]  To start on the outer edge of the plant
[43:31.210 --> 43:33.210]  Because the roots that are newer and fresher
[43:33.210 --> 43:35.210]  And growing and searching for water
[43:35.210 --> 43:37.210]  Are those outer roots
[43:37.210 --> 43:39.210]  So you want to get the outer perimeter of the dirt wet
[43:39.210 --> 43:41.210]  The inside of the root zone there
[43:41.210 --> 43:43.210]  The water will work its way in
[43:43.210 --> 43:45.210]  Because the roots will pull it there
[43:45.210 --> 43:47.210]  So think about a cannabis plant
[43:47.210 --> 43:49.210]  Let's envision a cannabis plant
[43:50.090 --> 43:52.090]  Out in a field by itself
[43:52.090 --> 43:54.090]  Or with other friends
[43:54.090 --> 43:56.090]  You have a cannabis plant standing there
[43:56.090 --> 43:58.090]  The leaves hang off of it
[43:58.090 --> 44:00.090]  In a tent shape
[44:00.090 --> 44:02.090]  It is protecting the inside of that plant from moisture
[44:02.090 --> 44:04.090]  So when the rain hits it
[44:04.090 --> 44:06.090]  If rain comes down from the sky
[44:06.090 --> 44:08.090]  And it is being brought out to the outer edge of the plant
[44:08.090 --> 44:10.090]  Hardly any water will land on the ground
[44:10.090 --> 44:12.090]  Near the stalk of that plant
[44:12.090 --> 44:14.090]  Because all of the leaves
[44:14.090 --> 44:16.090]  Are pushing it out to the perimeter
[44:16.090 --> 44:18.090]  So I kind of believe
[44:18.970 --> 44:20.970]  That a plant will grow
[44:20.970 --> 44:22.970]  As wide as its root mass will allow it
[44:22.970 --> 44:24.970]  So if you water the outer edge of that pot
[44:24.970 --> 44:26.970]  Then your plant is going to grow wider
[44:26.970 --> 44:28.970]  Because it is going to feel like it is getting more water
[44:28.970 --> 44:30.970]  Also that wideness of the plant
[44:30.970 --> 44:32.970]  Should kind of represent the root mass
[44:32.970 --> 44:34.970]  So when the rain comes down
[44:34.970 --> 44:36.970]  The rain will drip off of the plant
[44:36.970 --> 44:38.970]  And fall right at the perimeter of the plant
[44:38.970 --> 44:40.970]  And that is where those roots are in my opinion
[44:40.970 --> 44:42.970]  And so it will drink that right up
[44:42.970 --> 44:44.970]  And also if you water the outside of that
[44:44.970 --> 44:46.970]  It will keep your roots active
[44:47.850 --> 44:49.850]  So if you are watering the outside of that pot
[44:49.850 --> 44:51.850]  Try to water around the outer edge
[44:51.850 --> 44:53.850]  You are going to want to soak the soil anyway
[44:53.850 --> 44:55.850]  But make sure you get that outer area wet
[44:55.850 --> 44:57.850]  That is the important part
[44:57.850 --> 44:59.850]  Not right there in the middle
[44:59.850 --> 45:01.850]  One good way to do that
[45:01.850 --> 45:03.850]  If you have time
[45:03.850 --> 45:05.850]  Make a little mound around your stalk
[45:05.850 --> 45:07.850]  Just grab a handful of the soil
[45:07.850 --> 45:09.850]  In the pot
[45:09.850 --> 45:11.850]  And make a coneal shape
[45:11.850 --> 45:13.850]  Around the stalk
[45:13.850 --> 45:15.850]  So when you water
[45:16.730 --> 45:18.730]  Try to get the water to the outer edge of the pot
[45:18.730 --> 45:20.730]  Not so much in the center
[45:20.730 --> 45:22.730]  So that is a couple of things I saw
[45:22.730 --> 45:24.730]  At a consultation that I thought I would share with you guys
[45:24.730 --> 45:26.730]  Also you guys, clean up after yourselves
[45:26.730 --> 45:28.730]  Don't do something tomorrow
[45:28.730 --> 45:30.730]  That could be done today
[45:30.730 --> 45:32.730]  Because when you start getting lazy as a grower
[45:32.730 --> 45:34.730]  That is when you fall behind
[45:34.730 --> 45:36.730]  That is when shit gets messy
[45:36.730 --> 45:38.730]  When shit gets behind and messy
[45:38.730 --> 45:40.730]  Is when you have problems
[45:40.730 --> 45:42.730]  When you are growing on a professional level
[45:42.730 --> 45:44.730]  And you are trying to have professional quality buds
[45:45.610 --> 45:47.610]  You need to be in there every day
[45:47.610 --> 45:49.610]  You need to be diligent
[45:49.610 --> 45:51.610]  You need to be on top of shit
[45:51.610 --> 45:53.610]  Nothing can wait until tomorrow
[45:53.610 --> 45:55.610]  If it needs to be done today
[45:55.610 --> 45:57.610]  You should probably get in there and do it today
[45:57.610 --> 45:59.610]  Because plants are only alive
[45:59.610 --> 46:01.610]  If you think about it
[46:01.610 --> 46:03.610]  Your plants are only alive
[46:03.610 --> 46:05.610]  They are in flower for 9 weeks
[46:05.610 --> 46:07.610]  That is 63 days
[46:07.610 --> 46:09.610]  Plants only live for about 100 days indoors
[46:09.610 --> 46:11.610]  Maybe 120, 150 at the most
[46:11.610 --> 46:13.610]  So you only have 150 days
[46:14.490 --> 46:16.490]  Your patients will know it
[46:16.490 --> 46:18.490]  Your flowers will show it in the end
[46:18.490 --> 46:20.490]  It will be well worth your time
[46:20.490 --> 46:22.490]  Just get in there and do that shit
[46:22.490 --> 46:24.490]  I want to talk a little bit about defoliation
[46:24.490 --> 46:26.490]  I have been experimenting with defoliation
[46:26.490 --> 46:28.490]  What that is, is just going and taking off
[46:28.490 --> 46:30.490]  All of the big fan leaves
[46:30.490 --> 46:32.490]  Early in flower
[46:32.490 --> 46:34.490]  I put two plants side by side
[46:34.490 --> 46:36.490]  The same exact strain
[46:36.490 --> 46:38.490]  I used a Jeffs OG
[46:38.490 --> 46:40.490]  Because it is something I am very familiar with
[46:40.490 --> 46:42.490]  And I tore off all of the fan leaves on one plant
[46:43.370 --> 46:45.370]  About a week into flower
[46:45.370 --> 46:47.370]  If there was a petiole
[46:47.370 --> 46:49.370]  I cut that leaf off at the petiole
[46:49.370 --> 46:51.370]  Right at the stem
[46:51.370 --> 46:53.370]  So this plant looked completely naked
[46:53.370 --> 46:55.370]  There was just a bunch of buds up a stick
[46:55.370 --> 46:57.370]  There were no leaves
[46:57.370 --> 46:59.370]  And the one next to it looks like a big leafy pot plant
[46:59.370 --> 47:01.370]  As time went on the leaves grew back
[47:01.370 --> 47:03.370]  I went and cut those leaves off again
[47:03.370 --> 47:05.370]  I did it about every 7-10 days
[47:05.370 --> 47:07.370]  I was in there cutting off major amounts of leaf
[47:07.370 --> 47:09.370]  Off of these plants
[47:09.370 --> 47:11.370]  It started growing so much leaf
[47:12.250 --> 47:14.250]  Toward week 6
[47:14.250 --> 47:16.250]  It looked like the plant next to it
[47:16.250 --> 47:18.250]  I had never defoliated
[47:18.250 --> 47:20.250]  It was spitting out a lot of leaf
[47:20.250 --> 47:22.250]  I kept cutting them off
[47:22.250 --> 47:24.250]  They were just little tiny leaves
[47:24.250 --> 47:26.250]  I wasn't getting too crazy
[47:26.250 --> 47:28.250]  It was my first time trying it
[47:28.250 --> 47:30.250]  I noticed that the lower buds
[47:30.250 --> 47:32.250]  Got chunkier
[47:32.250 --> 47:34.250]  I didn't think it would work that way
[47:34.250 --> 47:36.250]  My opinion has always been
[47:36.250 --> 47:38.250]  That those bigger leaves
[47:38.250 --> 47:40.250]  Were the solar collectors
[47:41.130 --> 47:43.130]  I think I will have to experiment more
[47:43.130 --> 47:45.130]  With this defoliating
[47:45.130 --> 47:47.130]  I've noticed I get a little better airflow
[47:47.130 --> 47:49.130]  The plants seem to be happier
[47:49.130 --> 47:51.130]  When I cut down a lot of the leaf
[47:51.130 --> 47:53.130]  If you have some leaves
[47:53.130 --> 47:55.130]  That are shadowing a bud
[47:55.130 --> 47:57.130]  Or if your plant looks a little too leafy
[47:57.130 --> 47:59.130]  I encourage you to choose one plant
[47:59.130 --> 48:01.130]  In your garden
[48:01.130 --> 48:03.130]  And experiment with a little bit of extreme defoliation
[48:03.130 --> 48:05.130]  You don't have to go extreme if you don't want to
[48:05.130 --> 48:07.130]  But if you want to
[48:07.130 --> 48:09.130]  The plants will handle it
[48:10.010 --> 48:12.010]  I got 5.5oz of Jeffs OG
[48:12.010 --> 48:14.010]  In a 7 gallon pot
[48:14.010 --> 48:16.010]  In the plant that was defoliated
[48:16.010 --> 48:18.010]  I got 6.25oz
[48:18.010 --> 48:20.010]  So that's 3.25oz
[48:20.010 --> 48:22.010]  Which is not a whole lot of a difference
[48:22.010 --> 48:24.010]  When you go by a whole room
[48:24.010 --> 48:26.010]  But that's still 21g of cannabis
[48:26.010 --> 48:28.010]  Just by cutting off some leaves
[48:28.010 --> 48:30.010]  And I did everything else the same
[48:30.010 --> 48:32.010]  The plants looked very similar up until that moment
[48:32.010 --> 48:34.010]  So that's a little bit of defoliating
[48:34.010 --> 48:36.010]  If you guys have any comments
[48:36.010 --> 48:38.010]  Or if you want to know more about that
[48:38.890 --> 48:40.890]  I thought I would share it with you guys
[48:40.890 --> 48:42.890]  Alright
[48:42.890 --> 48:44.890]  I'm going to wrap up this bonus Thursday episode
[48:44.890 --> 48:46.890]  I appreciate you guys for hanging out with me
[48:46.890 --> 48:48.890]  I think this is a good make up
[48:48.890 --> 48:50.890]  For my short episode last week
[48:50.890 --> 48:52.890]  Instead of a 130 minute you guys got two 20 minute episodes
[48:52.890 --> 48:54.890]  That should work for you
[48:54.890 --> 48:56.890]  I really appreciate you guys for listening to me
[48:56.890 --> 48:58.890]  And supporting the podcast
[48:58.890 --> 49:00.890]  I've been getting a lot of listens lately
[49:00.890 --> 49:02.890]  I can tell by the website
[49:02.890 --> 49:04.890]  I just go and check out some stats
[49:04.890 --> 49:06.890]  You guys are really paying attention
[49:07.770 --> 49:09.770]  I truly appreciate it
[49:09.770 --> 49:11.770]  What I would truly appreciate
[49:11.770 --> 49:13.770]  Is if you went to iTunes
[49:13.770 --> 49:15.770]  Go to the iTunes store
[49:15.770 --> 49:17.770]  Find the review section
[49:17.770 --> 49:19.770]  Give me a 5 star rating
[49:19.770 --> 49:21.770]  Type in a comment
[49:21.770 --> 49:23.770]  Let me know what you think about the show
[49:23.770 --> 49:25.770]  I will read your comments on a future episode
[49:25.770 --> 49:27.770]  The reason I want you guys to leave comments
[49:27.770 --> 49:29.770]  And give me a 5 star rating
[49:29.770 --> 49:31.770]  Is because that's what moves me up in the ranks in iTunes
[49:31.770 --> 49:33.770]  And if I move up in the ranks in iTunes
[49:33.770 --> 49:35.770]  More people will see the show
[49:36.650 --> 49:38.650]  And more people will click and listen
[49:38.650 --> 49:40.650]  And more people will learn how to grow quality cannabis
[49:40.650 --> 49:42.650]  And the more people that are learning to grow quality cannabis
[49:42.650 --> 49:44.650]  Which means
[49:44.650 --> 49:46.650]  There's more quality cannabis
[49:46.650 --> 49:48.650]  Available for everyone to smoke
[49:48.650 --> 49:50.650]  English is getting hard
[49:50.650 --> 49:52.650]  So I'm just going to end this show already
[49:52.650 --> 49:54.650]  You guys don't forget
[49:54.650 --> 49:56.650]  The show is available on iTunes, Stitcher
[49:56.650 --> 49:58.650]  And every single episode is always and forever
[49:58.650 --> 50:00.650]  Archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com
[50:00.650 --> 50:02.650]  Make sure you check me out
[50:02.650 --> 50:04.650]  On all the social media
[50:05.530 --> 50:07.530]  I'm on most of them
[50:07.530 --> 50:09.530]  If I'm not on something
[50:09.530 --> 50:11.530]  Let me know
[50:11.530 --> 50:13.530]  I'm wrapping up this show
[50:13.530 --> 50:15.530]  My throat is burning out
[50:15.530 --> 50:17.530]  And words are getting hard
[50:17.530 --> 50:19.530]  So it's time to go take some dabs
[50:19.530 --> 50:21.530]  Until next time
[50:21.530 --> 50:23.530]  Take a fat dab
[50:23.530 --> 50:39.280]  And give your mom a hug
[50:39.280 --> 50:41.280]  Welcome back cannabis community
[50:41.280 --> 50:43.280]  It's time for episode 97
[50:43.280 --> 50:45.280]  Of the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[50:45.280 --> 50:47.280]  Your source for cannabis news
[50:48.160 --> 50:50.160]  If you're a new grower
[50:50.160 --> 50:52.160]  If you're a professional grower
[50:52.160 --> 50:54.160]  If you're a new smoker
[50:54.160 --> 50:56.160]  If you're a cannabis activist
[50:56.160 --> 50:58.160]  Or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis
[50:58.160 --> 51:00.160]  This my friends is the podcast for you
[51:00.160 --> 51:02.160]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff
[51:02.160 --> 51:04.160]  Sitting across the table from me is my good buddy White Mike
[51:04.160 --> 51:06.160]  How you doing today bro?
[51:06.160 --> 51:08.160]  Doing well man, how are you?
[51:08.160 --> 51:10.160]  I'm doing great man, thanks for joining me
[51:10.160 --> 51:12.160]  For those of you guys that don't know, Mike is a good friend of mine
[51:12.160 --> 51:14.160]  We've been in the cannabis industry
[51:14.160 --> 51:16.160]  The legal cannabis industry together
[51:17.040 --> 51:19.040]  That's the marijuana extended time
[51:19.040 --> 51:21.040]  Um, closer to 7
[51:21.040 --> 51:23.040]  Okay, I'll give you that much
[51:23.040 --> 51:25.040]  I recently had to run the timeline
[51:25.040 --> 51:27.040]  Which is why I know that number a little faster
[51:27.040 --> 51:29.040]  Okay, I'll believe you
[51:29.040 --> 51:31.040]  Mike says we've been in this industry together
[51:31.040 --> 51:33.040]  It seems like a lot longer
[51:33.040 --> 51:35.040]  When you're trimming time kind of stretches
[51:35.040 --> 51:37.040]  Oh god it does
[51:37.040 --> 51:39.040]  And we've trimmed a lot of herb together
[51:39.040 --> 51:41.040]  You have trimmed a lot of my herb for me
[51:41.040 --> 51:43.040]  I have
[51:43.040 --> 51:45.040]  So Mike's a fellow cannabis activist
[51:45.920 --> 51:47.920]  He's also a co-worker over at the Spot Dispensary
[51:47.920 --> 51:49.920]  He's shaking his head yes
[51:49.920 --> 51:51.920]  I am, you can't do that
[51:51.920 --> 51:53.920]  That's right, I'm on a podcast
[51:53.920 --> 51:55.920]  I didn't ask a question or anything
[51:55.920 --> 51:57.920]  So there was no need for you to respond
[51:57.920 --> 51:59.920]  Other than a head shake was appropriate
[51:59.920 --> 52:01.920]  But it was just funny to watch you shake your head
[52:01.920 --> 52:03.920]  And think that the people might have heard that
[52:03.920 --> 52:05.920]  Yep, speak the truth brother
[52:05.920 --> 52:07.920]  Yeah, so he's a co-worker over there
[52:07.920 --> 52:09.920]  Um, we're gonna talk about that in just a second
[52:09.920 --> 52:11.920]  Actually here, let's just go for it
[52:11.920 --> 52:13.920]  Today over at the Spot Dispensary man
[52:14.800 --> 52:16.800]  Yeah this was a big moment
[52:16.800 --> 52:18.800]  That's one of the last sign offs we've been waiting on
[52:18.800 --> 52:20.800]  Before I get too far
[52:20.800 --> 52:22.800]  Follow Mike on Twitter
[52:22.800 --> 52:24.800]  It's Nemopunk15
[52:24.800 --> 52:26.800]  Make sure you follow him there on the Twitter
[52:26.800 --> 52:28.800]  Nemopunk15, he's a cannabis activist
[52:28.800 --> 52:30.800]  He posts a lot of good news related articles
[52:30.800 --> 52:32.800]  He posts a lot of great topics
[52:32.800 --> 52:34.800]  That way you can be following him, checking out his feed
[52:34.800 --> 52:36.800]  Stalking him while you're listening to the show
[52:36.800 --> 52:38.800]  It's always fun to know who you're checking out
[52:38.800 --> 52:40.800]  Follow me and then shoot me a message or tweet
[52:40.800 --> 52:42.800]  Let me know you're following from the podcast
[52:43.680 --> 52:45.680]  Yes I do
[52:45.680 --> 52:47.680]  So today at the Spot Dispensary
[52:47.680 --> 52:49.680]  The fire inspector
[52:49.680 --> 52:51.680]  The Pueblo West Metro fire inspector showed up
[52:51.680 --> 52:53.680]  And we've got these big windows
[52:53.680 --> 52:55.680]  He did a fire inspection and of course we passed
[52:55.680 --> 52:57.680]  I'm gonna jump right to that
[52:57.680 --> 52:59.680]  We fucking passed
[52:59.680 --> 53:01.680]  I'm not even gonna do any hesitation to that one
[53:01.680 --> 53:03.680]  We passed with flying colors
[53:03.680 --> 53:05.680]  But here's the great part
[53:05.680 --> 53:07.680]  We've got these big sliding doors that go over some windows
[53:07.680 --> 53:09.680]  Our facility is set up to be a touring facility
[53:09.680 --> 53:11.680]  So we put giant glass windows
[53:12.560 --> 53:14.560]  Between the tour area and where the plants will be
[53:14.560 --> 53:16.560]  So that the plants will not become contaminated
[53:16.560 --> 53:18.560]  By anything that our touring people will come in with
[53:18.560 --> 53:20.560]  And also they won't be able to touch the plants
[53:20.560 --> 53:22.560]  So it keeps us completely compliant and legal
[53:22.560 --> 53:24.560]  So we've designed the facility to be tour prepared
[53:24.560 --> 53:26.560]  So we've got these big giant windows
[53:26.560 --> 53:28.560]  Would you say they're 12 feet tall Mike?
[53:28.560 --> 53:30.560]  Easy, easy 12
[53:30.560 --> 53:32.560]  Alright so these are big 8 by 12
[53:32.560 --> 53:34.560]  They're about 8 feet wide
[53:34.560 --> 53:36.560]  By about 12 feet tall
[53:36.560 --> 53:38.560]  Big ass panes of glass
[53:38.560 --> 53:40.560]  And they're about 6 feet wide
[53:41.440 --> 53:43.440]  Big ass panes of glass with gigantic
[53:43.440 --> 53:45.440]  They're garage doors
[53:45.440 --> 53:47.440]  But calling them garage doors downplays them
[53:47.440 --> 53:49.440]  Yeah it's
[53:49.440 --> 53:51.440]  It's a good description but I can't do better
[53:51.440 --> 53:53.440]  But yeah it underplays significantly
[53:53.440 --> 53:55.440]  What we've got here
[53:55.440 --> 53:57.440]  They're garage doors made by Kodak
[53:57.440 --> 53:59.440]  And they're used in the darkroom
[53:59.440 --> 54:01.440]  Film developing industry
[54:01.440 --> 54:03.440]  And the professional film developing industry
[54:03.440 --> 54:05.440]  Is what I was told these doors are for
[54:05.440 --> 54:07.440]  So we've got these grow rooms
[54:07.440 --> 54:09.440]  And of course in the night cycle in the grow rooms
[54:10.320 --> 54:12.320]  They're 100% darkness
[54:12.320 --> 54:14.320]  And we need to have that whenever the timer requires that
[54:14.320 --> 54:16.320]  So these doors, garage style doors
[54:16.320 --> 54:18.320]  Roll up and down
[54:18.320 --> 54:20.320]  On a little button
[54:20.320 --> 54:22.320]  And it keeps the light out
[54:22.320 --> 54:24.320]  And it also, maybe we're doing something in there
[54:24.320 --> 54:26.320]  That we don't want you to watch
[54:26.320 --> 54:28.320]  So maybe we can close it down for privacy
[54:28.320 --> 54:30.320]  So the workers can work in there without the tourists seeing that little area
[54:30.320 --> 54:32.320]  So the fire inspector came
[54:32.320 --> 54:34.320]  And a big part of those doors is their fire safety
[54:34.320 --> 54:36.320]  If there happens to be a fire in that grow room
[54:36.320 --> 54:38.320]  Those doors will pop down
[54:39.200 --> 54:41.200]  The smoke alarm will go off
[54:41.200 --> 54:43.200]  When the smoke alarm triggers a drop
[54:43.200 --> 54:45.200]  And those doors all drop at one time
[54:45.200 --> 54:47.200]  And then the fire hopefully is contained to that small area
[54:47.200 --> 54:49.200]  And we can put it out
[54:49.200 --> 54:51.200]  The fire inspector was walking around
[54:51.200 --> 54:53.200]  He had his arms crossed
[54:53.200 --> 54:55.200]  Trying to be tough
[54:55.200 --> 54:57.200]  You know what I mean
[54:57.200 --> 54:59.200]  The fire inspector has to be a brute
[54:59.200 --> 55:01.200]  He can't be a pussy
[55:01.200 --> 55:03.200]  He has to hold his ground and be a stern dude
[55:03.200 --> 55:05.200]  And you can see the look on his face
[55:05.200 --> 55:07.200]  Like wow this is kind of a nice facility
[55:08.080 --> 55:10.080]  He's holding his clip and boarding his pen like a tough guy
[55:10.080 --> 55:12.080]  And then he goes
[55:12.080 --> 55:14.080]  What I need to see is I want you to trip one of these fire alarms right here
[55:14.080 --> 55:16.080]  He just picked one randomly
[55:16.080 --> 55:18.080]  And he goes I need all of these doors to fall
[55:18.080 --> 55:20.080]  And we looked at each other like
[55:20.080 --> 55:22.080]  They're going to fall
[55:22.080 --> 55:24.080]  We tested them all day yesterday
[55:24.080 --> 55:26.080]  We fine tuned this shit
[55:26.080 --> 55:28.080]  He pushes the button and it goes beep
[55:28.080 --> 55:30.080]  And all the doors came down beautifully in unison
[55:30.080 --> 55:32.080]  It sounds like a train starting up
[55:32.080 --> 55:34.080]  When they go down
[55:34.080 --> 55:36.080]  Because there's like 15 of these doors that weigh 300 pounds each
[55:36.960 --> 55:38.960]  And they just all perfectly in unison
[55:38.960 --> 55:40.960]  And when they hit the floor there's a little trigger that stops them
[55:40.960 --> 55:42.960]  And like a hydraulic that makes them just
[55:42.960 --> 55:44.960]  And they stop
[55:44.960 --> 55:46.960]  And he uncrossed his arms and looked around
[55:46.960 --> 55:48.960]  And he goes I'm impressed I'm going to sign off
[55:48.960 --> 55:50.960]  And we went and signed our little fire paper thing
[55:50.960 --> 55:52.960]  So it was so great to hear him
[55:52.960 --> 55:54.960]  When you impress the fire inspector
[55:54.960 --> 55:56.960]  You're doing something right
[55:56.960 --> 55:58.960]  A lot of people have worked really hard to get that piece of paper signed
[55:58.960 --> 56:00.960]  That's absolutely true
[56:00.960 --> 56:02.960]  Shout out to Sam, Sam was a big help that day
[56:02.960 --> 56:04.960]  The department of agriculture
[56:05.840 --> 56:07.840]  Told us they were impressed
[56:07.840 --> 56:09.840]  Because we are doing what other people said is not possible
[56:09.840 --> 56:11.840]  For a grow facility
[56:11.840 --> 56:13.840]  Other people can't seem to catch on
[56:13.840 --> 56:15.840]  And figure out how to do what Robert has done in that place
[56:15.840 --> 56:17.840]  So shout out to the spot
[56:17.840 --> 56:19.840]  You guys are doing it right
[56:19.840 --> 56:21.840]  People keep asking me how long
[56:21.840 --> 56:23.840]  It's getting close you guys
[56:23.840 --> 56:25.840]  Make sure you drop in the spot dispensary
[56:25.840 --> 56:27.840]  If you're ever in Pueblo or Pueblo West Colorado
[56:27.840 --> 56:29.840]  This is not a spot commercial
[56:29.840 --> 56:31.840]  I just wanted to talk about some exciting shit that happened
[56:31.840 --> 56:33.840]  I of course am the lead grower at the spot dispensary
[56:34.720 --> 56:36.720]  What happens all day keeps me excited
[56:36.720 --> 56:38.720]  We get to do some fun shit
[56:38.720 --> 56:40.720]  It's a lot of fun at work
[56:40.720 --> 56:42.720]  I remember hearing people say if you do something you love
[56:42.720 --> 56:44.720]  It doesn't feel like work all day
[56:44.720 --> 56:46.720]  There's a lot of shit about my job that feels like work all day
[56:46.720 --> 56:48.720]  I'm not saying it doesn't
[56:48.720 --> 56:50.720]  But there's a lot of really fun shit that happened too
[56:50.720 --> 56:52.720]  I've got some 90% THC hash in my oval right now
[56:52.720 --> 56:54.720]  It was only in the shop for like 9 hours
[56:54.720 --> 56:56.720]  Was all that was on the shelf
[56:56.720 --> 56:58.720]  Basically the first 15 people to find out we had it
[56:58.720 --> 57:00.720]  Bought it
[57:00.720 --> 57:02.720]  And then the next day
[57:03.600 --> 57:05.600]  I would have bought it had I known it was there
[57:05.600 --> 57:07.600]  And I don't even buy dispensary hash very often
[57:07.600 --> 57:09.600]  Employees weren't at work and said put one in the safe for me
[57:09.600 --> 57:11.600]  And managers didn't get a shot at it
[57:11.600 --> 57:13.600]  And bought shit off of the other employees
[57:13.600 --> 57:15.600]  First come first serve
[57:15.600 --> 57:17.600]  Deal with it
[57:17.600 --> 57:19.600]  But yeah
[57:19.600 --> 57:21.600]  There's a lot of perks like that
[57:21.600 --> 57:23.600]  Just roll through randomly
[57:23.600 --> 57:25.600]  This wasn't a topic planned for the show or anything
[57:25.600 --> 57:27.600]  But let's talk about this a little bit
[57:27.600 --> 57:29.600]  I'm going to fix this compressor here
[57:29.600 --> 57:31.600]  I did turn up your mic a touch
[57:32.480 --> 57:34.480]  But here we go
[57:34.480 --> 57:36.480]  Let's talk about how people are always coming in and dropping off applications to the dispensary
[57:36.480 --> 57:38.480]  And I get a lot of emails
[57:38.480 --> 57:40.480]  On the IRI Genetics
[57:40.480 --> 57:42.480]  Facebook website
[57:42.480 --> 57:44.480]  My own personal Facebook
[57:44.480 --> 57:46.480]  The Grow From Your Heart
[57:46.480 --> 57:48.480]  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter
[57:48.480 --> 57:50.480]  People are always asking
[57:50.480 --> 57:52.480]  They're always talking about how they want to work at a dispensary
[57:52.480 --> 57:54.480]  Because they want to play with weed all day
[57:54.480 --> 57:56.480]  And it must be fun to play with weed
[57:56.480 --> 57:58.480]  As weed
[57:58.480 --> 58:00.480]  How long have you been a weed user?
[58:01.360 --> 58:03.360]  How long have you been a bud tender this time?
[58:03.360 --> 58:05.360]  I know you were a bud tender for a little while when we had the other dispensary
[58:05.360 --> 58:07.360]  Going on about 5 months now
[58:07.360 --> 58:09.360]  5 months now
[58:09.360 --> 58:11.360]  Has weed just basically become a product?
[58:11.360 --> 58:13.360]  Or is it something that's fluffy and still amazing
[58:13.360 --> 58:15.360]  And unicorn shit still?
[58:15.360 --> 58:17.360]  It's still unicorn-y
[58:17.360 --> 58:19.360]  Today we got it
[58:19.360 --> 58:21.360]  A new edible option
[58:21.360 --> 58:23.360]  That I've had in the back of my mind
[58:23.360 --> 58:25.360]  Like when I see one
[58:25.360 --> 58:27.360]  Grab one
[58:27.360 --> 58:29.360]  And it's been 7 years now
[58:30.240 --> 58:32.240]  And I ain't fucking seen one
[58:32.240 --> 58:34.240]  And they showed up today in my own store
[58:34.240 --> 58:36.240]  And yeah I have one sitting in my bag right now
[58:36.240 --> 58:38.240]  That's going to get devoured here shortly
[58:38.240 --> 58:40.240]  Oh I saw that edible
[58:40.240 --> 58:42.240]  Um yeah
[58:42.240 --> 58:44.240]  So it's still like
[58:44.240 --> 58:46.240]  You still have a unicorn to chase every day you go to work?
[58:46.240 --> 58:48.240]  At least once a week something comes through
[58:48.240 --> 58:50.240]  That getting it in
[58:50.240 --> 58:52.240]  Checking it out
[58:52.240 --> 58:54.240]  Getting to tell other people about it all day
[58:54.240 --> 58:56.240]  Just blows my mind awesome
[58:56.240 --> 58:58.240]  Now how much, what percentage of your day
[58:59.120 --> 59:01.120]  What percentage of your day is that unicorn chase
[59:01.120 --> 59:03.120]  I've just titled it the unicorn chase at work
[59:05.120 --> 59:07.120]  I don't know 5%
[59:07.120 --> 59:09.120]  Yeah okay
[59:09.120 --> 59:11.120]  And the other 95% is fucking work right?
[59:11.120 --> 59:13.120]  Not quite
[59:13.120 --> 59:15.120]  Yeah okay
[59:15.120 --> 59:17.120]  For example
[59:17.120 --> 59:19.120]  Doing our pre-roll joints we do
[59:19.120 --> 59:21.120]  Like a pound worth at a time
[59:21.120 --> 59:23.120]  So that's 450 joints
[59:23.120 --> 59:25.120]  And change
[59:25.120 --> 59:27.120]  And it takes days to go from
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  This is what we're going to pre-roll to
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  Here's what we have on our pre-roll selection
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  And the entire time
[59:34.000 --> 59:36.000]  It's in the corner of the sales floor
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  So we have customers all day going
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  Oh dude that looks like the best job ever
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  And it's not at all the best job ever
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  It would be if you could smoke one of them
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  The whole time you were rolling
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  Then it wouldn't be so terrible
[59:48.000 --> 59:50.000]  But just sit there and roll joint after joint
[59:50.000 --> 59:52.000]  After joint after joint
[59:52.000 --> 59:54.000]  Without being able to smoke it
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  Your hands get sticky
[59:56.880 --> 59:58.880]  And that's the hardest grind at work right now
[59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880]  Trimming is going to equal that easily
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.880]  Trimming will be a bitch
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.880]  So that's where I was headed with this
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.880]  Everybody wants to come work at the dispensary
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.880]  But keep in mind after you turn in your application
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.880]  If we do hire you
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.880]  There will be a lot of tedious work
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.880]  We had a bunch of people come in and apply today
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.880]  And two of them came
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.880]  Well dressed
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.880]  Clean, appropriate
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.880]  Turned in resumes
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.880]  Spoke eloquently
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.760]  Came in with lunch all over his shirt
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.760]  At 9 o'clock at night
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.760]  And was like half sloppy drunk
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.760]  Like I want to work here
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.760]  Give me the info
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.760]  He ain't going to work here
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.760]  No he is not
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.760]  He is not going to work there
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.760]  He is not getting a call back
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.760]  Yeah we get dozens of people a day
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.760]  And honestly we are going to be hiring a lot of people here soon
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.760]  Everybody in Colorado is expanding
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.760]  Everybody
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.760]  The industry is doubling this year
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.640]  If it is only one more state
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.640]  The industry is going to triple at least
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.640]  In the next two or three years
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.640]  And that means three times the employees
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.640]  The spot has I think I counted 20
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.640]  There is about 20 employees
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.640]  There were a couple that didn't come to the meeting the other day
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.640]  There are about 20 of us full time employed there right now
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.640]  And we are short staffed
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.640]  We could definitely use a couple people
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.640]  So turn in your resume at the spot
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.640]  Get your badge
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.640]  That's the first thing you got to do
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.520]  But once you do get the job there
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.520]  Be prepared to do some work
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.520]  It's not just going to be playing with weed
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.520]  Another thing I wanted to mention
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.520]  Somebody was talking about
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.520]  You guys are just hanging out smoking dope all day
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.520]  No
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.520]  We can't even smoke tobacco on the property
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.520]  Because it might look like marijuana on the cameras
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.520]  And we don't need that mess with the regulators
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.520]  Yes
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.520]  I think the rule is a thousand feet from the premises
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.520]  Before anybody is allowed to smoke
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.520]  Near any dispensary
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.400]  I think the technical rule is
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.400]  It may not be true
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.400]  I don't know if there is a
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.400]  You can't smoke in public
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.400]  In parking lots or in public
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.400]  And as far as on the dispensary premise goes
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.400]  We are specifically barred from having any sort of consumption
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.400]  Allowed on our property
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.400]  By state regulation
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.400]  And that includes all employees
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.400]  There has been a number of dispensaries that have been fined
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.400]  Because employees had
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.400]  Like vape cartridge pens in their purses
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.400]  And stuff
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.280]  I can't have my rig in my car
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.280]  While I'm on the clock
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.280]  If my car is in the parking lot at the dispensary
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.280]  Sorry guys I'm burping
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.280]  I just opened up a fresh drink
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.280]  And I'm burping it up while I'm recording here
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.280]  While I'm on the clock at the dispensary working
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.280]  I can't have my fresh shiny green Toro rig
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.280]  In my case
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.280]  In my backpack
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.280]  In the car
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.280]  So that when I get off work
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.280]  I can drive over to Mike's house and dab him out
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.280]  I can't have it there
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.160]  I'm a medical marijuana patient
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.160]  And sometimes my back hurts
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.160]  Sometimes I will have to
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.160]  No
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.160]  No
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.160]  If I choose to
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.160]  If I choose that I need to medicate during working hours
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.160]  I have to drive home
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.160]  And take a dab, eat lunch
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.160]  And then drive all the way back to work
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.160]  Because I can't bring my damn backpack and dab rig to work
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.160]  Mike shaking his head no
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.160]  Like you shouldn't say that
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.160]  But people have seen my periscope
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.040]  By the time I get back to work
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.040]  It's like a 30 minute drive back to the middle of the desert
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.040]  Right
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.040]  It is a little annoying
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.040]  I have to leave town everyday for work
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.040]  But I don't really care I've commuted much further
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.040]  It's a good drive to put on some music
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.040]  And just jam out
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.040]  Because it's a fast drive
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.040]  It's mostly highway miles so it's legit
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.040]  Alright let's put this show back on the damn road
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.040]  No we're not allowed to smoke at work
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.040]  We're not allowed to medicate anywhere near the building
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.040]  If you think about it
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.920]  When you go to the liquor store is the clerk drunk
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.920]  When you go to the Gap
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.920]  Fair point the kids probably dress in all Gap
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.920]  But like
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.920]  We go so far with it at work
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.920]  That there's a special protocol for employees
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.920]  We buy stuff all day
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.920]  Everyday there's at least two employees
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.920]  That work that day buying something
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.920]  But we've got special protocol for it
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.920]  Because if it's just like
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.920]  In my car we can get in a lot of trouble
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.920]  For it
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.920]  Oh yeah
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.800]  So if you go in and you buy that diesel hatch
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.800]  What do you have to do with it?
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.800]  It goes in the safe until the end of the shift
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.800]  And then right at the end of the night
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.800]  As for we lock the front door
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.800]  Employees want anybody buying anything
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.800]  And then we all queue up just like custies
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.800]  Wow okay
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.800]  Right at the end of the night
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.800]  And then it all gets sealed in an exit bag
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.800]  Like it does for everyone
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.800]  Like we can't throw it in a backpack or nothing
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.800]  Oh wow yeah
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.800]  Because it's all official
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.680]  They've told me not to even bring my backpack
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.680]  Once in a while I'm going to have to bring clothes
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.680]  And stuff because I work in the back
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.680]  I'm required by the department of agriculture
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.680]  To have at least one change of clothes
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.680]  Like all the way down to the underwear and socks
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.680]  In a locker accessible because I'm handling
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.680]  Pesticides and other chemicals
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.680]  And things so I'm required to have a change of clothes
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.680]  But they're like
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.680]  Bring as little backpack and stuff as you need
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.680]  To bring here
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.680]  We don't want backpacks and shit coming into the building
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.680]  We don't need it on camera
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.560]  They're like please just don't
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.560]  So I pretty much take what I need
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.560]  If they haven't said anything about mine
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.560]  Because it never leaves the security desk
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.560]  I come in and it gets set on the counter
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.560]  And it comes off the counter again when I leave
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.560]  I go into the back and it's like a labyrinth back there
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.560]  There's all kinds of nooks and crannies
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.560]  And there wouldn't be anywhere really to put my backpack anyway
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.560]  Nope your locker
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.560]  It wouldn't fit
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.560]  The lockers are teeny
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.560]  I haven't been back there since the lockers came in
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.560]  Yeah they're purse size so if you got a purse
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.440]  We're kind of way off topic here
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.440]  I don't even know what the hell we're talking about anymore
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.440]  It's good I like it
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.440]  It was a really good week
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.440]  People that are not from Colorado kind of like to hear
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.440]  How our lives are and what's going on
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.440]  And since we're two dudes that work it
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.440]  That's one of the fun part
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.440]  People come in everyday and are just blown the fuck away
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.440]  About how regular it is
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.440]  How many
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.440]  So I heard another person ask this
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.440]  And I thought it would be interesting
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.440]  And I was going to talk about it in a future episode
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.320]  What's the breakdown of people
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.320]  Where they're from
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.320]  How many people are Colorado folk
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.320]  How many people are from out of state
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.320]  Am I talking shit when I say that probably
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.320]  50% of the people that come in are from Texas
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.320]  Is that true
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.320]  Yeah fully
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.320]  Especially if we do a breakdown
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.320]  If we're talking about a year range
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.320]  Easily half the people that come through
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.320]  Most recreational dispensaries are tourists
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.320]  That's state wide
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.320]  In places like Aspen it's like 80 or 90%
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.200]  Marijuana is crazy expensive
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.200]  We get people from Aspen in our shop
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.200]  It's crazy expensive
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.200]  In Aspen
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.200]  And they're down in Pueblo because they were driving through the area
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.200]  And weed maps told them to stop here
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.200]  Go to the spot
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.200]  And they get loaded up before they head back to their city
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.200]  In Colorado where it's way more expensive
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.200]  And touristy
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.200]  But easily half the people that roll through
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.200]  Are from Texas
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.200]  It comes in bizarre ways
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.200]  Like one day everybody will be from Alabama
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.080]  Yesterday it was Missouri
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.080]  And truckers
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.080]  We actually have a bus load
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.080]  I don't know how they actually travel
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.080]  There were 10 of them
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.080]  They come from Kansas
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.080]  And they all come together
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.080]  And they always show up
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.080]  They come about once a month
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.080]  There are 10 of them that show up
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.080]  It's like a field trip
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.080]  It happens way more often than you'd think
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.080]  Families come through today
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.080]  There was a girl with her grandmother
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.960]  And the granddaughter was mortified
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.960]  And they're buying weed together
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.960]  We get shit like that constantly
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.960]  It's kinda neat
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.960]  Grandma and granddaughter buying herd together
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.960]  And they're all blown away
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.960]  Because we have marijuana stores where you can walk in
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.960]  And just like every other store
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.960]  There's a salesperson there to tell you all about it
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.960]  The biggest obstacle to the shop
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.960]  Is the security guard
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.960]  You have to have an ID that says you're 21
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.960]  And if you got that
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.960]  Go on in and buy some
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.840]  And you can go buy weed
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.840]  People don't know what to think sometimes
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.840]  I don't get to spend a lot of time up front
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.840]  Because I'm supposed to be in the back of the cave
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.840]  Growing the weed
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.840]  But sometimes I got to venture up to the front
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.840]  I got questions, I got to go find a boss
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.840]  And they're hard to find
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.840]  So I just find myself in the bud room watching
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.840]  And seeing what's going on
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.840]  And a good portion of the people that I meet
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.840]  Are from out of state
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.840]  And they all see the little board with the pins in it
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.840]  And they're like what's this
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.720]  If your spot doesn't have a pin
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.720]  Put a pin in there
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.720]  And they're like alright
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.720]  And I see everybody trying to find the little spot
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.720]  We had two from Michigan today when I was up there
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.720]  I get somebody from a different country at least once a week
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.720]  There's people from all over the planet
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.720]  We had a bunch of gorgeous girls from New Zealand
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.720]  Come through one day
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.720]  It was awesome
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.720]  On the regular
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.720]  People from all over the planet
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.720]  Coming to Colorado to smoke weed
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.720]  And they're coming through Pueblo
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.600]  And there might be some really beautiful women in the waiting room
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.600]  Holy crap
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.600]  We've gotten way far off topic here
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.600]  This is not a spot commercial
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.600]  We're official for 20 minutes about work
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.600]  We spend a lot of time at work
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.600]  Some cool shit happens there
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.600]  Some cool shit does happen there
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.600]  I've got a news article that I wanted to talk about
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.600]  Before we get there guys
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.600]  I wanted to tell you what's going on in another realm of my world
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.600]  I've been talking about Damsel's Denk
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.600]  If you have not been keeping up
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.600]  If you don't listen to every single episode
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.480]  Come on, what are you doing
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.480]  You can't listen to everything
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.480]  I know, I know, there's other shit to listen to
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.480]  There's a suicide girl
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.480]  She's a friend of mine
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.480]  If you're not familiar with the suicide girls
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.480]  Make yourself familiar with that
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.480]  Don't look at the suicide girls
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.480]  It will maybe do
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.480]  If you work at the spot, go ahead
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.480]  The suicide girls are models
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.480]  And they mostly are tattooed
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.480]  And have some piercings
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.480]  And maybe some dreadlocks
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.360]  They're not your normal cover girl model
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.360]  I think burlesque is the word you're looking for
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.360]  That might be the word I'm trying to fish out of my brain
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.360]  Thanks for the help
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.360]  All these diesel dabs are making my brain sticky
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.360]  Anyway, I've got a suicide girl
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.360]  Who's a friend of mine
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.360]  She goes by Duditz Damsel
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.360]  Is her suicide girl name
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.360]  She works with Green and Healthy Wellness
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.360]  A dispensary in Colorado Springs
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.360]  That is now relocating
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.360]  They're building the new facility
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.360]  So if you guys are fans of Green and Healthy Wellness
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.240]  I think we talked about that
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.240]  I think they're on that
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.240]  Anyway, so Duditz Damsel asked me to develop a strain for her
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.240]  Right now I have got two
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.240]  I've started three phenotypes
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.240]  Three different strains from seed
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.240]  That I'm going to phenotype from for her
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.240]  Two of those are now into flower
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.240]  They are about 48 hours into flower
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.240]  I think somewhere around there at this point
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.240]  So in about nine weeks
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.240]  We will have the first two test batches
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.240]  Of the phenotype
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.240]  And then we will have the first two test batches
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.120]  Of Damsel's Dank
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.120]  For Duditz Damsel, my favorite suicide girl
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.120]  Damsel and I
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.120]  And a few other suicide girls
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.120]  And my buddy the Grimy Gatsby
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.120]  And a couple of the Terpy Boys
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.120]  And a few other folks
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.120]  Mike's giving me the head nod like wait
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.120]  You said a few other suicide girls
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.120]  The numbers are looking good here
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.120]  We're going to have a tasting party
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.120]  It will probably be in Colorado Springs
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.120]  Possibly Denver
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.120]  I was just hoping on a testing kit for myself
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  You may get a sample of what gets selected
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  Because there will be things
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  That she likes that I don't like
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  That I don't like that she does like
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  I think I said that the opposite
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  But the grower and the breeder all like different things
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  Than her. For her we're looking for
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  One specific thing. There may be something
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  That pops out of this search for us
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  That we're going to keep that has nothing to do with her
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  That's more what I wanted it for
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  I wanted to get in on the pheno hunt
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  For an entirely different reason
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  He's like let's find my new medicine
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.880]  The party will be pretty damn fun
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.880]  From what I hear. They know how to throw a party
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.880]  John Hunt is the Terp Gatherer
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.880]  I just did say that
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.880]  That is the truth
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.880]  So they're in flower
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.880]  In like 9 weeks we should have some
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.880]  In like 9 weeks we should have some
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.880]  Damsels dank to sample
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.880]  It will be a lot of fun. I'll keep you guys updated on how that goes
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.880]  They should be here to take some pictures
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.880]  And things pretty soon
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.880]  That will be really interesting
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.880]  We'll try to get damsel on the podcast before too long
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.760]  But you guys since green and healthy had to relocate
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.760]  Without a lot of warning
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.760]  They are fucking slammed and busy
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.760]  Yup. Yes
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.760]  Let's see we've been going 22 minutes
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.760]  Do we want to read an article
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.760]  Or do we want to talk. Yeah let's go read this news article
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.760]  I've got here because I found this interesting
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.760]  And it's kind of
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.760]  It's kind of important maybe this will help some people
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.760]  Out and this will definitely interest Mike
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.760]  Mike doesn't know what I'm going to read
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.760]  This will definitely get your attention Mike
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.760]  The headline says
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.640]  Warnings to makers of legal CBD hemp oil products
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.640]  Let me go and find who it's by
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.640]  So I can give them credit
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.640]  It's by Thomas H. Clark from the Daily Chronic
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.640]  I found it on the Daily Chronic
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.640]  We will read the article
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.640]  It goes a lot like this
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.640]  Consumers should beware purchasing and using any such products
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.640]  The FDA says
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.640]  The Food and Drug Administration has sent letters
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.640]  To several makers of cannabidiol oils
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.640]  Derived from hemp telling them to stop making medical claims
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.640]  About their products ability to treat disease
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.640]  Many sellers of the hemp based cannabidiol products
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.520]  Who advertise their products as legal in all 50 states
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.520]  Because they are derived from industrial hemp
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.520]  Have been making claims that their products are rich
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.520]  In cannabidiol and can be used for the diagnosis
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.520]  Cure, mitigation, treatment
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.520]  Or preventation of diseases
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.520]  According to the FDA
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.520]  The FDA which considers CBD an unapproved new drug
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.520]  Said these companies are misbranding the products
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.520]  And issuing false claims to consumers
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.520]  Often these products do not even list their ingredients
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.520]  On the product label the FDA said
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.520]  Consumers should beware purchasing and using any such products
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.520]  The FDA says
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.400]  Consumers should beware purchasing and using any such products
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.400]  It is important to note
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.400]  That these products are not approved by the FDA
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.400]  For the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.400]  Or prevention of any disease
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.400]  In late February
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.400]  The FDA issued several warning letters
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.400]  To seven companies that manufacture
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.400]  And market hemp oils claiming to be rich in CBD
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.400]  By promising cures for conditions
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.400]  Such as cancer, autism, and epilepsy
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.400]  None of which have been tested by the FDA
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.400]  The companies who were issued warning letters
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.400]  Appear to be violating food, medical, and medical claims
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.280]  Violating food and drug labeling laws
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.280]  In some cases
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.280]  God excuse me
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.280]  Hold on the throat is going crazy here
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.280]  I'm going to take a drink
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.280]  This happens occasionally
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.280]  We take a lot of dabs
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.280]  Mug it
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.280]  Mug it sounds like I'm doing something dirty
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.280]  He meant take a drink of that delicious root beer
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.280]  Mugging it sounds like
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.280]  I don't know that just sounded gross
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.280]  Where am I?
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.280]  I'm right here
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.160]  This stuff has been on the market for a while
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.160]  And it's always been crap
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.160]  One thing I wanted to get to
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.160]  Is a lot of this stuff is brought in from other countries
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.160]  Because now that we have got this market
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.160]  They're doing kind of like what they did with Spice
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.160]  They see that this CBD stuff is really popular
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.160]  And they're just sending us crap
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.160]  It may be partially CBD
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.160]  So they can write that on the bottle
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.160]  But then it's just other random oils
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.160]  Just as a filler
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.160]  So you don't even know what you're giving these sick kids
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.160]  You have to get
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.040]  I'm going to stop reading the article
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.040]  And I'll try to remember where I am with this rant
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.040]  The following companies and products were among those notified by the FDA
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.040]  And there are hyperlinks here also
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.040]  And it lists a bunch of companies
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.040]  Cancer, Herbtea, Florida
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.040]  CBD Life Holdings of Arizona
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.040]  Hemp Oil Care of California
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.040]  Pure CBD of Washington
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.040]  It lists a bunch of them
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.040]  And then it also says
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.040]  The FDA also conducted tests of some products sold by these companies
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.040]  And found that in most cases
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.040]  The products contained very little cannabidiol
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.920]  And there are some bullet points
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.920]  That show some of the test findings
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.920]  I won't read them all
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.920]  It says the FDA tested two separate samples of Ultra CBD
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.920]  Sold by CBD Life Holdings
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.920]  For it's
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.920]  One ounce bottle for $45 on their website
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.920]  Or on Amazon
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.920]  Of the samples tested
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.920]  One did not contain any cannabinoids
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.920]  While the second contained only .02% CBD
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.920]  All the products tested by the FDA
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.920]  That were found to contain some CBD
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.920]  The Ultra CBD products
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.800]  Contained the smallest percentage
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.800]  So you guys are paying for stuff that doesn't even have any CBD in it
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.800]  Which is going to make me wonder
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.800]  What is in it?
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.800]  This is a big issue
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.800]  For a lot of east coast states
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.800]  That have passed Charlotte's Web style laws
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.800]  That allow for CBD only
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.800]  Products
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.800]  But they don't allow for you to get them anywhere
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.800]  Right
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.800]  Essentially the law requires you to come to Colorado
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.800]  Or another legal state
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.800]  Buy something and then break a bunch of federal laws
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.680]  By taking it home
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.680]  And then if you're able to smuggle it home
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.680]  You can go ahead and legally use it
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.680]  But that's mildly insane
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.680]  So when you're googling
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.680]  And you see hemp oil, CBD
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.680]  Legal in all 50 states
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:03.680]  It doesn't even say hemp oil
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.680]  It's CBD oil is what this one package says
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.680]  If you're lucky you're getting hemp seed extract
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.680]  If you're lucky
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.680]  If you're lucky
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.680]  If not you're getting
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.680]  The bottom layer of whatever oil
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.560]  So the article keeps going
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.560]  I want to finish this up
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.560]  Just so we can finish the whole article
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.560]  It says
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.560]  The warned CBD companies have 15 days
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.560]  To show the FDA
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.560]  How they are complying with the warning letters
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.560]  Failure to promptly correct these violations
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.560]  May result in legal action
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.560]  Without further notice
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.560]  Including without limitation
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.560]  Seizure and or injunction
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.560]  The FDA warns
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.560]  Medical marijuana companies
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.440]  Medical marijuana experts suggest patients
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.440]  Considering CBD treatment
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.440]  To instead seek CBD rich strains of cannabis
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.440]  Grown in states that allow medical marijuana
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.440]  Such as Colorado
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.440]  Who also require independent laboratory testing
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.440]  Of all marijuana products
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.440]  So
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.440]  Medical experts are even saying
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.440]  What Mike and I say
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.440]  Go to Colorado
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.440]  And get some lab tested
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.440]  Facility grown
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.440]  Quality cannabis that's safe
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.320]  And it's got pesticides in it
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.320]  Because if it does
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.320]  It's been quarantined and taken away
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.320]  Like we're almost to where we need to be
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.320]  Regulatory wise here in Colorado
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.320]  They're going the wrong direction
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.320]  With their new regulations
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.320]  But where they need to be adding stuff
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.320]  Is in pesticide testing
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.320]  Those regulations aren't up to speed yet
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.320]  Because the testing labs aren't in place yet
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.320]  Because the FDA won't certify testing
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.320]  Like it just spirals
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.320]  Because of our dumb ass prohibition
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.200]  Legalize it nationally
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.200]  Just do it already
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.200]  And then the FDA would already be overseeing
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.200]  All this hemp seed extract shit
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.200]  You'd be able to legally confidently buy
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.200]  CBD oil
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.200]  This legit CBD oil
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.200]  You'd know what you were taking or giving your kid
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.200]  Or whatever
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.200]  So this is partially to warn people
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.200]  If you're buying this crappy CBD oil
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.200]  You're probably not getting any help
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.200]  For your ailment
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.200]  Hey if it's like
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.080]  If it's working and you felt better
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.080]  Should they quit doing it
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.080]  I don't know
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.080]  I'm not telling you to take or not to take
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.080]  That's the truth
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.080]  If something works, it works for a reason
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.080]  Yeah but
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.080]  Who knows what you're taking guys
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:30.080]  So the advice here is to come to Colorado
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.080]  Or legalize it where you are
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.080]  Fight for legalization
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:36.080]  And my guidance is
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.080]  When it comes time to legalize in your area
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:40.080]  Don't pass CBD only legislation
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.960]  Like recreational or medical cannabis
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.960]  Use
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.960]  To where you can consume flour
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.960]  To where you can make extracts
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.960]  To where you can consume extracts and edibles
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.960]  Make it all part of that
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.960]  Because just the CBD
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.960]  Is only going to work for a very small portion
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.960]  Of the medical cannabis community
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.960]  CBD doesn't do a damn thing for me
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.960]  Like I need my THC
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.960]  I need a high THC
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.960]  CBD does wonders for me
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.960]  Right
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.840]  I have a CBD episode coming up
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.840]  In the future
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.840]  I'm putting it together
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.840]  There are some episodes I can throw together
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.840]  In a day or two
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.840]  This CBD episode is going to take me quite a while
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.840]  It's going to be a series
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.840]  I'm going to get several people to talk on it
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.840]  And tell us how CBD treats them
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.840]  Mike is definitely going to be one of the people on there
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.840]  It's a really big topic
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.840]  It deserves some good prep
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.840]  I've got a lot of notes on it already
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.840]  Doug is going to be part of that show
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.720]  I just met a few people recently
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.720]  That are well known in the CBD community
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.720]  So that will help us out
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.720]  And we're finally starting to get CBD
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.720]  Products reliably
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.720]  In the rec market
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.720]  I got all tongue tied
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.720]  I was impressed
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.720]  We were talking to the purchaser for the shop
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.720]  He asked us for guidance
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.720]  He knows that we're potheads
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.720]  He's like what should I buy guys
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.720]  And he showed us an order
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.720]  That he was able to get really high CBD products
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.600]  So we've got that available for people as well
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.600]  Come check it out
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.600]  Try some CBD
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.600]  It may help you out
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.600]  For some people it's the miracle
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.600]  For me it's nothing
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.600]  Don't go with the CBD only
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.600]  Because CBD only wouldn't do anything for me
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.600]  It's the synergistic effect
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.600]  We're searching for
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.600]  You need a little bit of THC to make it all work
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.600]  I think it's all one unified thing
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.600]  That's my opinion
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.600]  So when it comes time to legalize
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.480]  Don't just do CBD
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.480]  I need to give a shout out to the author of this article
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.480]  I like to remind you who it was
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.480]  It was Thomas H. Clark from the Daily Chronic
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.480]  Be careful if you're using
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.480]  Hemp oil CBD products
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.480]  Don't make yourself sicker than you already are
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.480]  Know what you're using
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.480]  If you're buying stuff from a shop
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.480]  And it doesn't have lab testing
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.480]  Start asking for it
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.480]  It's just a matter of time
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.480]  Until this is just like everything else
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:04.480]  When you go to a store and buy something
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.360]  Be sure what's in it
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.360]  And be sure what's on the label is actually in it
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.360]  Because the FDA is testing this thing
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.360]  Randomly
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.360]  Now we have the MED backing you up
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.360]  In Colorado the FDA is not allowed to
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.360]  So we literally had to create from the ground up
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.360]  Our own MED
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.360]  I remember when the first testing labs were open
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.360]  The state didn't give a shit
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.360]  That was the industry demanding it
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.360]  Patients were beginning to demand it
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.360]  Shops needed to know what they were putting out
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.360]  And testing
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.240]  Back in the day I was able to take my product
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.240]  My finished flowers
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.240]  My hash to a shop and have it tested
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.240]  There's discussions of reopening labs
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.240]  To caregivers
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.240]  I hope so because right now they've locked down the rules
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.240]  So tight
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.240]  Well part of the thing is that the shops have them so overwhelmed
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.240]  There are so few labs that are qualified
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.240]  That right now if I wanted to take my product
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.240]  I'd probably have to wait a month anyway
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.240]  So they just disallowed us to be able to do it
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.240]  There's one type of testing
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.240]  And I honestly can't remember what it is
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.120]  It's not potency
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.120]  But I can't remember what the specialty test
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.120]  We were hoping to get done
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.120]  There's only one lab and it's in Durango
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.120]  Oh it's a residual solvent test
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.120]  Is what you guys are looking for
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.120]  That's only for hash
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.120]  They can only do that in Durango
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.120]  And so we're literally discussing who we're going to send to Durango
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.120]  Because we can't send stuff through the mail
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.120]  To the testing lab
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.120]  So one of us is going to draw the short straw
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.120]  And drive like 14 hours across the state
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.120]  It's 14 hours
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  I'm ball parking
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  I might need a day off
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  That'll be fun
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  It's the opposite of fun
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  I think Steve Hill-Halen can possibly do those same tests
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  But I'm not sure
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  Don't quote me there
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  Yeah that was a discussion I overheard a couple of months ago
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  Yeah I heard part of that today actually
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  We were talking about labs and such today
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  In one of the offices
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  Awesome
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  Too much talk about work on this episode huh guys
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  Leave it in the comments
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.880]  We've been gone about 33 minutes
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.880]  I've got a couple more things here that I'm going to save
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.880]  Because this right here is going to take a while
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.880]  I wanted to talk about
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.880]  I'm just going to give it a couple of quick seconds here
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.880]  Then we don't have to get too much into it
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.880]  You guys follow the UFC a lot
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.880]  I'm not a huge UFC follower
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.880]  I follow Joe Rogan more than I follow the UFC
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.880]  But that's attached
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.880]  That's my third degree of separation
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.880]  But there is something that happened in the UFC
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:26.880]  That as a pothead
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.880]  As a cannabis activist
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.760]  This got my attention
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.760]  There is a UFC fighter
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.760]  Who tested positive for using cannabis
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.760]  Who has been suspended for 5 years
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.760]  5 years dude
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.760]  His career has been put on hold
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.760]  His salary has been put on hold
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.760]  And they also fined him
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.760]  $150,000
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.760]  For failing a P-test
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.760]  For cannabis
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.760]  I think that's kind of silly
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.760]  Dude that's insane
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.760]  Yeah that's his job
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.640]  That's what this guy has trained his whole life for
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.640]  It's totally insane
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.640]  And there is a couple of different reasons why it's insane
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.640]  If it was steroids
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.640]  This would be a little insane
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.640]  5 years is an insanely long amount of time
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.640]  It's not a performance enhancing drug
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.640]  It's been shown to be helpful
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.640]  In protecting against concussions
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.640]  And recovering from head injuries
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.640]  These guys get punched and kicked in the face
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.640]  For a living
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.640]  That's his job
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.640]  There is a thousand reasons
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:29.520]  There is a thousand different reasons
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.520]  Why this is insane
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.520]  I'm going to probably butcher her name
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.520]  So I apologize
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:37.520]  She could for sure kick my ass
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.520]  I think it's Ronda Rousey
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.520]  She independently went off during a press conference
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.520]  And I saw that video
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.520]  I've only peripherally followed this story
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.520]  But she went off for basically the same reasons I did
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.520]  Right to misquote Ronda Rousey
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.520]  To paraphrase and misquote her
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.520]  Basically what she said was
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.520]  If somebody uses steroids
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.400]  And they're in a ring fighting
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.400]  That potentially gives them the ability to
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.400]  Hit me harder and kill me
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.400]  But if they are smoking cannabis
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.400]  That gives them the ability to heal themselves
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.400]  They're smoking a plant that was put here
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.400]  For us to smoke
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.400]  And we're going to punish people for it
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.400]  Is basically what she said
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.400]  I'm going to fuck it all up I already told you that
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.400]  I totally agree with her
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.400]  Ronda Rousey is absolutely on the money with that
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.400]  There is a petition
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.400]  I'm not going to beg you guys to sign the petition
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.280]  If you're into the UFC and you think it's wrong
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.280]  That this dude has been suspended
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:31.280]  They did give him 3 P-Tests
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.280]  And 2 of them
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.280]  Were clean
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.280]  And this third one was not even necessary
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.280]  I've got a news article on the screen that I was going to read
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.280]  But I didn't even want to get that far into this
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.280]  But it says
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.280]  Diaz submitted 3 urine samples
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.280]  On the night, one prior to his fight
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.280]  And two in the hours afterward
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.280]  I'm really going quickly through this
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.280]  Of those 3 samples, the first and the third
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:56.160]  Both of those came back clean
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.160]  So that's the
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:00.160]  World Anti-Doping Agency
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:02.160]  You can't cheat that P-Test
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.160]  I don't care how bad you are
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.160]  They see your wiener
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:08.160]  They see your dick when you're peeing
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.160]  They watch the pee come out of the head of your pee hole
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.160]  Like it comes
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.160]  They watch it into the container
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.160]  And then they fucking seal it themselves
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.160]  They're wearing rubber gloves and can't see it
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:20.160]  And they're like, I don't care
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.160]  I don't care
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:25.040]  They're wearing rubber gloves and catching it for you basically
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.040]  It's not the only reason I'm not an MMA fighter
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.040]  But it's on the fucking list
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.040]  But then it says however
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.040]  Uh
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.040]  The 1030 PM test however
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.040]  Was administered by a separate testing representative
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.040]  And submitted to Quest Diagnostics
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.040]  A non-WADA accredited lab
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.040]  So that lab's not even accredited
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.040]  That test came back over the threshold
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.040]  For allowable marijuana metabolites
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.040]  Resulting in the lone positive test
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.040]  This company that tested him
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.920]  Isn't even accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:55.920]  And they did pass their
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.920]  Look
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.920]  What the fuck Las Vegas Sporting
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.920]  Whatever you're called
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.920]  The Nevada Sporting and something commission
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.920]  I'm not cool with you guys
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.920]  This sucks
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.920]  You guys need to go uh
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:11.920]  Just sign the petition so that Nick Diaz can get back
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.920]  Get his career back
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.920]  Five years for a UFC fighter dude
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.920]  That's like half of your career
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.920]  You only get to go from your early 20s
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.800]  Once you get to the mid 30s testosterone starts dropping
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:24.800]  You can't take a punch as well
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.800]  Is he gonna come back like Tyson after prison
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.800]  The fucking knee blows out or something
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.800]  What do you mean talking silly and chasing pigeons
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.800]  No like destroying people
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.800]  With half a punch
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.800]  Just destroying people
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.800]  It might be neat to see but I don't want to have to wait five years to see it
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.800]  I think the dude should get to be able to fight
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.800]  For me this is just another example of why
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.800]  Everyone needs to get involved
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.800]  And get educated
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.800]  Like this guy doesn't get to fight for five years
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:51.680]  Because he peed dirty
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.680]  Other people are losing their kids because they peed dirty
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.680]  Like other people are going to jail
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.680]  Because they're selling people pot that people want
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.680]  Because we want to smoke a plant
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.680]  While other people can drink some shit
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.680]  That makes them drive like maniacs
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.680]  Oh I can't blame it on alcohol
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.680]  But yeah because people want to smoke a plant
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:09.680]  We're going to jail
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.680]  We're not allowed to have the careers we want
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.680]  This dude can't fight
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.680]  This is terrible
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.680]  Because we all hang back like we all get shit on regularly
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.560]  Alright I think that's enough for Nick Diaz
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.560]  Support that you guys I do
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.560]  Mike thanks for joining me bro
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.560]  Didn't want to end on a down note
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.560]  No well what positive shit you got for us
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.560]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for you
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.560]  That's my line bro
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.560]  There's more shit to go
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.560]  I was looking for something positive there
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:38.560]  And that's the first thing that popped into my head
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.560]  The positive thing is that we will be back
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.560]  Or at least I will be back next Monday
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.560]  I'll have a whole other episode for you
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.560]  We're going to talk about
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.440]  Stuff
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.440]  I've been in an argument
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.440]  A discussion with a stranger on Facebook
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.440]  About is holding your smoke a good idea
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.440]  He thinks you get higher from holding your smoke
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.440]  That was his statement
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:01.440]  And then we'll talk about other people's theories
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.440]  Including mine
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.440]  If you'd like to be involved in this
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.440]  We will schedule this for a time when Mike can return for the podcast
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:09.440]  Interesting topic
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.440]  Because I'd like to get your
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.440]  Well it's not going to be the whole show
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.440]  But definitely you're going to hear my opinion on that
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.320]  If somebody else would like to come
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.320]  I think it's not a good idea
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.320]  Message me, I'd like your opinion
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.320]  Delete an email Jeff
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.320]  Send me your opinion either way
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:28.320]  Holding your smoke
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.320]  When you take a bong hit
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.320]  When you take a dab
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.320]  When you take a smoke off of a joint
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.320]  Do you think it's a good idea to hold in your smoke for a few seconds
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.320]  How long do you think you should hold in your smoke
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.320]  Do you hold in your smoke differently for your dab
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.320]  Than you do a joint
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.320]  Let me hear it
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.200]  Do you think if you hold it for 10 or 15 seconds you're getting higher
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.200]  Let me hear your opinion on that
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.200]  You can tweet it to me
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.200]  If it's under 140 characters
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.200]  It's at GFYH podcast
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.200]  If it's longer than that
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.200]  You're going to have to email me
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.200]  At growfromyourheart.com
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.200]  Or of course you can hit me up on the Facebook
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.200]  Just find me it's growfromyourheart
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.200]  If you're one of my friends just text me
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.200]  It's so funny when I get text messages about the show
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.200]  You should talk about this
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.200]  I'm going to delete your text message
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:16.080]  I'm rambling now
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.080]  Contact me and let me know what you think about holding in your smoke
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:20.080]  That's what's coming up on a future episode
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:22.080]  Are you trying to think about more positive shit over there
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.080]  I see you staring off
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:26.080]  I'm also rattling through my brain about what I've read about holding in the smoke
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.080]  There's multiple opinions on this topic
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.080]  It's interesting
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.080]  We'll save that one
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:34.080]  We'll get that out on another episode
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:36.080]  Let's wrap up the show
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.080]  I'm trying to think of some positive shit
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:40.080]  We're here
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.080]  You're here
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.960]  Did you read that the CERN large hadron collider
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:46.960]  Was supposed to open up two black holes
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:48.960]  Which is going to open a wormhole
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.960]  And the earth was going to be swallowed
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.960]  And we're all going to die
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.960]  That was supposed to happen on the 23rd
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.960]  And we're recording on the 24th
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.960]  So guess what
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.960]  We survived
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.960]  We didn't die
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.960]  So that's a positive note
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.960]  We're here
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:08.960]  Bruce Willis gets to be the hero in this story
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.960]  I thought it would be Arnold Schwarzenegger
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:13.840]  I'm going to be the governor
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.840]  That's all he gets
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.840]  Bruce Willis is old and bald
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.840]  We'll give him the win
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.840]  We're going to wrap up the show
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.840]  Mike and I are chatty and high as shit
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.840]  Diesel dabs
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.840]  Those made me sativa-eyed
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.840]  Made me sativa everything
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:31.840]  Thank you for coming and hanging out
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.840]  Taking an hour out of your day
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.840]  You got a new baby at home
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:37.840]  Congratulations on that
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.840]  Thanks for taking time away from that little guy
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:42.720]  We'll wrap this up
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.720]  Make sure you follow Mike
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.720]  It's Nemopunk15 on Twitter
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.720]  Let him know you found him
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.720]  He likes to know where the followers came from
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:52.720]  Where his stalkers arrived from
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:54.720]  Sometimes it's easy to tell
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.720]  When it's 2am and I haven't tweeted in a day and a half
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.720]  And it's a stonery name
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.720]  I can assume
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.720]  Other times I have no fucking clue
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:04.720]  Dabby McDaverson just followed me
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.720]  I bet that's from the podcast
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.720]  Somebody's going to make up a screen named Dabby McDaverson
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.600]  It'll be really funny
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.600]  That shit happens
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.600]  Thanks again to Mike for showing up
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.600]  I'll be back in another week
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.600]  I don't have any sponsors for this month's podcast
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.600]  If you're interested in sponsoring the show
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.600]  Send me an email
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.600]  To growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.600]  I'll get you all the information you need
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.600]  You can sponsor the show
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.600]  We'll put your product out there
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.600]  We get over 5000 listens within 48 hours
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.600]  So we can hype up your product
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.600]  Really well
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:40.480]  Now that the show is over
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.480]  Please go to iTunes
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.480]  Search for Grow From Your Heart
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:46.480]  Find the review section
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:48.480]  And give me a 5 star rating
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.480]  Please
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.480]  We deserve it
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.480]  We deserve a thumbs up
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.480]  I bought a lot of toys
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:58.480]  Sounds good
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.480]  Type in a comment
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:02.480]  I'll read your comments on a future episode
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:04.480]  Follow me on all the social media
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.480]  The show is available on iTunes and Stitcher
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.360]  Every episode is always and forever
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.360]  Archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.360]  That'll never go away
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.360]  I do apologize if the website has not been updated
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:17.360]  In quite a while
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.360]  My web guy has been occupied with school
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.360]  So we'll let him do that
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.360]  Then he'll fix up the website
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360]  School first
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.360]  We're all about edumacation
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360]  I did say edumacation
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.360]  What else do we got?
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.360]  I think that's all we got for this show
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.360]  So until next time
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:38.240]  Peace

[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.240]  Huge shout out to my homie Mike

[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.240]  Take a fat dab
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:36:18.030]  And give your mom a hug
[01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:22.640]  For me

[01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:40.400]  Peace
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:36.440]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:41.160]  It's time for episode number 98 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:42.160]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:43.160]  That's right.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:47.320]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:51.120]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist, or if you're someone who's just curious about
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:54.320]  the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:55.320]  I'm your host.
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.320]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.320]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.840]  You guys sitting across the table from me once again is my good buddy, White Mike.
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:01.840]  How you doing, buddy?
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:02.840]  Doing well, man.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:03.840]  How are you?
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:04.840]  I am great.
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:05.840]  I'm a little bit dabbed the fuck out.
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:06.840]  I got a couple of new rigs.
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:07.840]  I've been hitting them like a champion.
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:08.840]  They're working.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:09.840]  The hash is working.
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:10.840]  Working well.
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:11.840]  I'm going to drop that music right out.
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:12.840]  I didn't mean to go so abruptly with the music.
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:13.840]  Sorry about that.
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:14.840]  Tried to be smooth, tried to transition.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:15.840]  We ended up just dropping that shit to zero.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:16.840]  Well, thanks for coming, bro.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:17.840]  Yeah.
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:18.840]  Did you work today?
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:19.840]  I did.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:20.840]  Yeah, you look like you've been at work all fucking day.
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:21.840]  I have.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:27.840]  It's been a long day at work, but we're not going to talk about work for all of us.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:28.840]  No, no.
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:32.000]  Last time Mike was here, we kind of talked a little bit about the spot last time.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  We're not going to do that.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.440]  We are going to talk about some other stuff.
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:37.640]  I just want to give Mike a big thanks for getting here because he's a new father.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.880]  I know it's got to be kind of rough pulling away from the kids.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.600]  So thanks for showing up at this kind of late hour on a Saturday night.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:43.600]  Right.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.560]  There's a couple of reasons I'm half awake right now.
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:46.920]  We'll slap you around if you fall asleep.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.600]  I may push the mic right in your face and make you talk a lot because I keep turning
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.120]  shit up and it's not going to go much higher.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:52.400]  All right.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.400]  I'll stay on the mic.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:54.400]  There you go.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.400]  There you go.
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:56.400]  That's what we need.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:57.400]  Nice.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.400]  So let's see.
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:40:59.400]  Where do we want to start?
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:00.400]  We've got a lot of great news articles to talk about you guys.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.400]  Before I get too far, I want to give a huge shout out to my new friends at Elevate Glass
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:05.400]  in Colorado Springs.
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.600]  Elevate Glass is on South Tahon.
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.160]  I should have the exact address in my hand.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:13.040]  I think it's 5, I'm going to say 512 South Tahon.
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.840]  It's on the 500 block of South Tahon.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:19.040]  There is a dispensary right there, Altitude Organic Medicine.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.040]  And then there's a tattoo shop.
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:23.360]  And then right next to that is Elevate the Glass Shop.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:24.360]  Go there.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:27.000]  They've got great glass at affordable pricing.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.880]  And they might have super hot chicks working there.
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:32.920]  Maybe, you know, that might be one of the bonuses of why I like to go there.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.480]  I can't confirm it or not.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.480]  Yeah.
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:36.480]  Mike has not gone with me.
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:40.880]  I've been there twice and both times there was a very lovely lady there, ready and willing
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:43.440]  and able to help me with all of my glass needs.
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:44.520]  It was great.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.520]  I'll definitely be back.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:49.960]  I got a new, I think I talked about the, it's a mothership knockoff.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.320]  Basically that I got there about a week ago.
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:55.560]  And then just last night I went and picked up a little Hitman.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:59.480]  It's a mini with the hammerhead on the inside and I had to grab it.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.040]  It's got a yellow logo.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:04.320]  I've never seen a Hitman like this with the yellow logo before.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.320]  And I thought it was super cute.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:08.160]  So I picked it up and man, it hits like a Mack truck.
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.160]  So I'm super impressed.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:10.160]  It really does.
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:16.760]  It's a, your collection is growing by leaps and bounds and the new additions are wonderful.
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.680]  Was the first word that comes to mind.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:19.680]  Nice.
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.640]  I don't have as many rigs as you might think because I got rid of a couple to replace,
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:24.640]  to make room for these.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.640]  So I swap them out.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.000]  Not with the old and with the new.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  That's the truth.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.520]  I'm not as much of a rig junkie as you might think.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:30.520]  Buy a Master Shake.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.960]  Yeah, Master Shake was fun.
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:32.960]  Sloppy's got that.
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:33.960]  Shout out to Sloppy.
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.560]  Make sure you guys check out Oil Olympian Arts on Facebook.
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:37.560]  That's my buddy Sloppy.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.560]  It's his glass trading page.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:43.800]  If you're looking for new glass or artistic glass, functional glass at a great price,
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.520]  my buddy Sloppy is now in the glass business.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:47.520]  So make sure you support that.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.520]  Shout out to Sloppy.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:50.520]  All right.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:51.520]  So somebody sent me an email.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:53.840]  Let's start off the show with an email from a friend.
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.560]  This is kind of not cannabis related.
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.600]  And it's funny because he starts his email.
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.440]  This is from my buddy Justin.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:02.840]  And the email says, so this isn't really a show or a growing question, just a matter
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:04.640]  of personal curiosity.
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:06.280]  What do you think of Montes Yahoo?
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.320]  Do you feel like his music is reggae or not?
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:10.600]  Or not really listen to him?
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:11.600]  Just wondering.
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:16.360]  Doing fat dabs from Justin G. Justin, dude, I want to give you a big shout out.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:17.840]  You follow me on Facebook.
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.260]  You follow me on the podcast.
[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:21.960]  You follow me on almost every Periscope video that I make.
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:24.480]  I really appreciate your support.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.280]  It's great to have a little cult that will listen to almost everything that I put out.
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:31.080]  I definitely appreciate you guys that are my little following there.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:32.080]  That's freaking awesome.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:33.760]  I totally appreciate that.
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:36.000]  So let's talk about Montes Yahoo.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.620]  Mike's ridden around in the car with me and heard what happens when Montes Yahoo comes
[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:40.620]  up on the shuffle.
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:44.280]  You got to join in and get out those reggae diggy doy diggy doy doys.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.960]  You got to get there and get going with him, dude.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:46.960]  That shit is so much fun.
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:51.040]  I've learned to meditate while you drive.
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:52.040]  Not just hold on.
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.040]  Yeah.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:58.320]  Well, kind of wedge yourself in there for impact and then tune out and pretend like
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.800]  it's not reggae all day.
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:01.080]  You put yourself in your happy place.
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:03.360]  Yeah, I get reggae'd enough at work, bro.
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:05.000]  Oh, they do play some reggae at work.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  All right.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.160]  So let's talk about how I feel about Montes Yahoo.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.840]  Dude, that's kind of...
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:15.160]  So one day my buddy Ross Christian, who is one of the guys that taught me a lot about
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.760]  Rastafar, I shout out to Chris, much respect.
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:21.440]  Ross Chris gave me a little CD with one Montes Yahoo song on it.
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.640]  I came home and listened to it and I was like, that is the shit right there.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.280]  I just really liked the flow.
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:28.440]  The music was good, but I liked the way it felt.
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:29.880]  It just flowed really smooth.
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:32.840]  His lyrics were really smooth over everything.
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:33.840]  So I downloaded more, right?
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:34.840]  And I loved it.
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:38.280]  I found Shake Off the Dust Arise and I found Live at Stubbs, or what was available at that
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:39.600]  time.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:44.520]  So I was driving from Pueblo, Colorado to Lawrence, Kansas on a regular basis.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:48.880]  I had a band out there and I lived here and had a band out there and then I'd travel back
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.200]  and forth all the time to take care of life.
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:55.960]  I had a CD player in the car and all of my CDs got stolen, except for the one that was
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:56.960]  in the CD player.
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:00.000]  That happened to a bunch of people I know.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  And it was Live at Stubbs.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.520]  It was the Live at Stubbs album.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:05.360]  So that's what I had to drive back and forth to Lawrence, Kansas.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:09.800]  And it's about a 10, 11 hour drive, depending on traffic and depending on how things go.
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:15.320]  So that's 10 or 11 opportunities to listen to that CD from beginning to end, both ways.
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:18.640]  Yeah, I totally fell in love with that album, dude.
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:21.520]  Shake Off the Dust Arise came a little bit later in my life.
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.080]  I think I got that one right after I got tired of the lot, right after the theft, right after
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:27.920]  everything got stolen.
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.040]  But yeah, so I went to Lawrence, Kansas and showed a couple of my friends.
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.360]  I was like, check this guy out.
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.720]  And then we saw him at Waka Rusa.
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:39.680]  And on the first night at Waka Rusa Fest in 2005, I believe, there wasn't anybody there.
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:42.560]  There was like 40 of us up front checking out Matis Yahoo.
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:45.320]  The second night, there had to be 150 people there.
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.200]  The third night, that place was packed, bro.
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:48.200]  He took one night off.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.200]  It was like a four night festival.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:52.360]  He takes a Saturday off for the Sabbath.
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.680]  By the Sunday night when he played, it was packed.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.960]  You couldn't even get in the tent to see the man anymore.
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:00.440]  Yeah, so over three nights, he just blew up like that.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:01.840]  So I've seen Matis.
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:04.520]  I got to go see Matis Yahoo on my one of my birthdays.
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:08.640]  My girlfriend took me to see him at the Beaumont Theater in Kansas City, Kansas.
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:11.400]  Of all random places when I lived in Lawrence.
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.960]  So yeah, I got to see Matis a few times.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.520]  I've seen him at the Bottleneck in Lawrence.
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.040]  I've seen him a lot.
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:19.360]  But yeah, that artist meant a lot to me just from that time period.
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.800]  It really brings me back to that whole time period of my life.
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:26.200]  I think Got No Water was my favorite Matis song.
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:30.720]  And then unfortunately, when he came out with the album Youth, I feel like he put all of
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:34.640]  his life's work into the Shake Off the Dust Arise album.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:38.680]  All of his writing for 20 years of being a person, he put into that.
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:42.800]  And then he did Shake Off Live at Stubbs, which is basically the same thing just live.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.200]  And then like, all right, now you've got a production deal and a record deal.
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:47.200]  Let's make an expensive album.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.720]  And he was like, oh shit, I already put it all out.
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:53.560]  It seemed like he had already kind of done almost like his new stuff.
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:56.880]  I don't like the new stuff as much as I did the old stuff.
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:57.880]  That happens to a lot of artists.
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:00.040]  I feel the same way about Spearhead kind of.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.920]  The older shit was much better.
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:08.640]  There's something about music that whatever drives you to create it, dies when enough
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.920]  money lands on top of it.
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.720]  That's kind of how I feel about it.
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:15.160]  Especially if you're like an angry band, that's where you see it the most.
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:18.200]  It's like, all right, you just got like a $12 million contract.
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:19.760]  Why are you still angry?
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:20.760]  Right.
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:23.560]  And unless they really start buying just more expensive heroin or something.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:24.560]  Right.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.560]  Yeah.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:28.440]  Where would music, this we've really gotten off the rails of this podcast, but where would
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.440]  music be without-
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.280]  I know you know a lot about weed.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.120]  He knows so much more about music.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:34.600]  I do know a lot about music.
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:37.240]  Yeah, I could probably, we could do a music podcast.
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:38.800]  I've played the drums for so long.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.080]  I can read and write music and I know a lot about music, music playing and listening.
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:44.720]  And then I also know about bands.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:49.240]  Yeah, we could do a whole show about that because we've gotten way off topic, but where
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:50.240]  would we be?
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:51.240]  Where would music be?
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:54.480]  Where would musicians be if they didn't alter their minds a little bit?
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:57.280]  The Beatles would have never came up with any of that shit if they didn't start-
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.040]  Life would be very, very boring if musicians didn't smoke weed.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.040]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:06.600]  The Grateful Dead would not have been fun if I was not tripping my face off.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:10.440]  I think there's a great Lenny Bruce rant to that effect if I remember correctly.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.440]  All right.
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.240]  So I want to put the show back on track just a little bit.
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:15.680]  We're almost 10 minutes in and we haven't talked about weed at all.
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.560]  Hey Justin, thanks for the email, dude.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:20.560]  You really made me time travel in my mind when I read that.
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.440]  I was really reminiscing on those days.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:23.800]  Matis Yahu is great.
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:25.480]  He's got a great message.
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:26.480]  He's a positive dude.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:29.960]  He doesn't use any profanity, so it's good for the kids.
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:35.240]  He only talks about good stuff and to pump your head and heart with good stuff is always
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:39.120]  better than listening to some negative shit that makes you want to do stupid shit.
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:43.640]  I don't listen to things like insane clown posse and shit like that because it doesn't
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:45.640]  support anything good for your mind.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.920]  So listen to some Matis Yahu.
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:48.920]  Listen to some Spearhead.
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:51.680]  A lot of people around here are into Naco.
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:53.920]  I can't get into Naco for some reason.
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:57.800]  Naco and medicine for the people, but a lot of the hippie kids or all the dreadlock kids
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:58.800]  are loving it now.
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:01.400]  So check that out if you need some good positive music in your life.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:05.920]  All right, let's get onto something that has something to do with cannabis.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.560]  Do you want to talk about, let's see, do you want to go, I got three topics here.
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.320]  They're all equally important.
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:13.840]  We've got the 30 shops.
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:17.840]  We've got recreational cannabis is now legal in the state of Oregon.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:20.240]  Should we start or end with good news?
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:21.880]  Well, all right.
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:23.120]  That's our good news.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:25.880]  And then we've got an article about somebody getting shot.
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.760]  So let's go bad, bad, good.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:29.480]  Let's end on a positive note this time.
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:30.480]  Last night it was a down note.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:31.960]  We had to come up with positive shit.
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:34.280]  All right, well then let's start the bad, bad.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:37.560]  If you want to go worst first, let me open up Google here.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.000]  I've already got this article saved.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  Where is it?
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  Here it is.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.400]  Um, it happened again this year, you guys, it is outdoor season and people, uh, people
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:49.360]  that are growing outdoors are sitting outside waiting for thieves.
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.440]  The past two weekends over the past 14 or 15 days, I have heard of about seven or eight,
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:57.400]  maybe nine or 10 outdoor grows getting stolen.
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:58.400]  It's that time of year.
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:02.440]  People it is ripper season or ripper homie season.
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:03.440]  I hate it.
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:12.160]  It's uh, I've had a lot of people in my world have just wrecked winners because of rippers.
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:18.640]  Do they, they spend all summer throwing their life into a crop and then it vanishes before
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:19.640]  it's done.
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:22.000]  You wake up, you go out there to water your plants and guess what?
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  They're not there anymore.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.360]  I saw something about a van get busted.
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:29.960]  I want to say it was in California that was just packed full of plants that had just been
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:30.960]  ripped.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:31.960]  Oh shit.
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:36.640]  Um, and I've seen a number of posts on Facebook of security cam footage with people's faces
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:37.640]  and people ripping plants.
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:38.640]  Yeah.
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:42.840]  Right now if you are in any pot group on Facebook, somebody has posted a picture of some asshole
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.120]  and it says this guy stole my pot plants.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.480]  Do you know who he is?
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:48.280]  It's all over Facebook right now.
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:49.720]  Somebody is getting ripped off.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:52.800]  So uh, it happened in our town.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.640]  Somebody, uh, let's just get right to the news article here.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:57.080]  You guys have got it on the, on the screen.
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:59.880]  The headline is you need something over there, bro?
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:01.160]  Yeah, no, no.
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:02.160]  You need a dab.
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:04.200]  Uh, my brain wants cigarette, but no.
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:05.200]  Oh yeah.
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:06.200]  You can't do that here.
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:10.280]  If you have a vape, I'll let you fade in here, but no came unprepared, came unprepared.
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:13.360]  I apologize for your lack of preparation son.
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.520]  Maybe if you take a dab, it'll fucking settle down your urge.
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:16.520]  I don't know.
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:17.520]  I appreciate that.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:18.520]  Keep you slightly coherent.
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:19.520]  You are half asleep on the show already.
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:20.520]  Guys, we can't, we can't make fun of Mike for being half asleep.
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:21.520]  He's a new father.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:22.520]  He worked a long shift.
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:23.520]  He went home and ate dinner and then he came over here.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.520]  It's like 11 o'clock on a Saturday night and this dude's here recording with me.
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:25.520]  I went to bed at 7am.
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:26.520]  Thanks baby.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.520]  I love you too.
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:28.520]  And uh, got up at 11 and then worked a nine hour shift.
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.520]  Like, yeah, dedicated.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:30.520]  You're fathering it up and I'm here recording a podcast.
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:31.520]  I'm here recording a podcast.
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.520]  I'm here recording a podcast.
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:33.520]  I'm here recording a podcast.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.520]  I'm here recording a podcast.
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:35.520]  I'm here recording a podcast.
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:36.520]  I'm here recording a podcast.
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:41.720]  We are getting it done for the people.
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:42.720]  Yeah.
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:43.720]  That's what we gotta do.
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:52.740]  Um, I'm running out of time to do things.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:55.780]  I've been dedicated to the spot lately.
[01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:57.400]  It's a jump and we're there all the time.
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:58.400]  Let's not talk about that.
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:52:59.400]  We can't talk about the spot on the show.
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:00.400]  It's Nate on the autism.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.400]  It's just why we're here at midnight, bro.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:02.400]  That's it.
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:04.800]  So the truth or the truth, the headline says fuck, we're here at nine 11.
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:07.600]  Demands illegal marijuana grow.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:09.400]  Now let's update the people why it's illegal
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:10.800]  before we even go too far.
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:13.040]  Because we are in Colorado.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.080]  Everyone is allowed to grow six plants of their own.
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:17.720]  Every adult, if you have a medical marijuana
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:19.040]  recommendation from a doctor,
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:21.620]  you are able to grow possibly more plants.
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:23.360]  But in the city of Pueblo,
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:25.080]  within the city limits of Pueblo,
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:27.880]  it is now illegal to grow any sort of cannabis,
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:30.760]  recreational or medicinal, outside of your home,
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:33.440]  in your yard that is not in an enclosed building.
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:35.140]  Greenhouses are illegal.
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:38.480]  It has to be like a sealed, normal building,
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:39.320]  like a structure.
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:43.760]  It has to be like in a building with a foundation
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:45.440]  as part of the rule.
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:47.020]  It has to be so many square feet.
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:49.760]  Like there are thorough rules that you have to follow.
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:50.680]  Excuse me.
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:53.040]  No worries, that happens with the dabs.
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:56.800]  You can't just plant six plants in your backyard anymore.
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:59.320]  They did away with that a year ago.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:00.960]  Statewide, you just have to have it
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.140]  in a locked enclosed space.
[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:05.860]  Every city and county and town now
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:08.180]  have their own little rules for the most part.
[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:10.580]  Right, so here we cannot grow outside.
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:13.780]  Following them, and so his grow was illegal
[01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:17.700]  and he's being charged with nuisance violations,
[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:20.460]  if I remember correctly, $1,000 a pop per plant.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:21.380]  Wow.
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:23.540]  Yep, so that's 6,000 in city fines,
[01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:25.180]  plus he's got to destroy the plants,
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:28.100]  plus he's being charged with first degree assault
[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:29.820]  for shooting a teenager.
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:30.900]  Eh, destroy them.
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:32.460]  I would just cut them down and take them inside.
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:33.620]  It's just about time.
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:34.660]  He has to destroy them.
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:35.820]  How he destroy them.
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:38.900]  Oh, they could be destroyed in a series of small fires.
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:40.700]  Yeah, he's got to cut them down
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:42.500]  and they can't be out there anymore,
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.220]  but it's harvest time anyway.
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:45.040]  Yeah.
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:46.860]  So he's just got to chop them down now.
[01:54:46.860 --> 01:54:47.800]  Take them inside.
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:51.340]  But had this garden been discovered by city inspectors
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:53.300]  or regulators or if the neighbor called the cops
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:56.500]  or whatever six months ago when they were knee high
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:57.540]  and there was no bud there,
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:59.220]  he would have had to cut them down then too.
[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:01.860]  Okay, all right, I'm going to continue with the article.
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:03.900]  We just wanted to explain why his grow was illegal
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:04.900]  since it is Colorado.
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:06.780]  That may be confusing to some folks.
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:07.620]  The article goes on to say,
[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:09.560]  police say the teen showed up at a hospital
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.940]  at about 4.15 a.m. Friday
[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:14.600]  with a gunshot wound to his right leg.
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.920]  The juvenile male initially stated he was shot
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.980]  after leaving a party on the west side of Pueblo,
[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:20.520]  police said in a news release.
[01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:24.260]  However, it was later determined that he had,
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:26.260]  he and another individual had jumped a fence
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:29.540]  into a yard on the 1600 block of Western 13th Street
[01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:32.820]  in hopes of finding marijuana plants and an outdoor grow.
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:35.240]  Investigators say Vincent Duran, age 55,
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:37.500]  the homeowner shot at the two alleged burglars
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.220]  striking the teen.
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:40.960]  The juvenile was treated, released,
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:42.960]  and taken to the Pueblo Youth Services Center
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:45.700]  where he was booked on burglary charges, police say.
[01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:47.340]  Gotta imagine how that would suck, dude.
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.340]  You go to steal some weed, you're just a teenage kid
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:51.340]  thinking you're gonna go jack some bud.
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:54.260]  You end up shot in the leg at the hospital
[01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:55.820]  and then in fucking jail.
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:57.780]  I have no sympathy.
[01:55:57.860 --> 01:55:59.140]  Yeah, I don't either, but fuck.
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:01.420]  I'm relieved the homeowner didn't kill him.
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:02.460]  Yeah, I'm glad he didn't die.
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:06.420]  I'm glad he just got, he was only injured, but Jesus.
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:08.060]  This article has been all over Facebook
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:11.380]  because our friends posted it to Facebook and shared it.
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:12.460]  And people have commented,
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:14.020]  fucking kid got what he had coming to him,
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:16.820]  and people have commented I would have shot him again.
[01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:19.260]  Guys, this is cannabis.
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:20.580]  I know this is your investment.
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:22.120]  I know this is your business.
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:25.660]  Please don't fucking shoot people over weed.
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:28.740]  You should be growing it legally anyway.
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:29.580]  It's legal here.
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:30.900]  Just follow the simple rules.
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:32.940]  And if somebody's trying to steal those plants,
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:33.760]  call the cops.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:34.820]  That's what they're there for.
[01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:36.780]  That's why legalization is beautiful
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:39.140]  is we finally get to use law enforcement
[01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:40.900]  when somebody tries to steal our weed.
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:43.740]  Yeah, and we had a friend recently stolen from
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:46.300]  who actually called and reported his plant stolen.
[01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:47.380]  And the cop asked him,
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:49.900]  how much was that plant going to harvest you?
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:50.860]  Was it going to yield?
[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:52.460]  And he told him how much it would yield.
[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:55.500]  And he said, what would that cost you to buy at a dispensary?
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:57.180]  And he told him what that would cost per ounce.
[01:56:57.180 --> 01:56:58.620]  He called me and got a price quote.
[01:56:58.620 --> 01:56:59.460]  Right.
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:01.340]  I told him it'd be this much per ounce, dude.
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:03.100]  And so on the police report,
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:05.740]  they valued each plant at what an ounce
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:07.460]  would cost at my shop.
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:09.620]  And now those people that will be caught
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:11.340]  because they've got video of them,
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:13.220]  they'll be charged with felony theft
[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:15.620]  because they took over a certain amount of dollars
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:17.060]  worth of product.
[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:20.300]  Like that's the real beauty of legalization
[01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:23.020]  is that we can use courts and lawyers and cops.
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:25.740]  The violence doesn't have to exist there.
[01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:27.140]  That's the truth.
[01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:28.220]  Even they're in your backyard,
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:29.580]  they're stealing your shit, you guys.
[01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:30.860]  Let the dog out.
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:33.700]  Yeah, you let the dog out, make them run.
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:36.100]  If you've got a firearm, point it at them.
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:37.500]  Don't fucking shoot them.
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:41.260]  Nine times out of 10, it's teenagers or dipshit kids
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:43.580]  and just flip the lights on and they're going to run away.
[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:44.420]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:45.580]  There's a 17 year old boy.
[01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:47.460]  If you would have said, freeze, get on the ground,
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:48.420]  you could have called the cops.
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:50.220]  You could have dealt with it a little bit better.
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:53.020]  This dude shot a young kid who was running away.
[01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:54.500]  He was already running away.
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:55.700]  That's not cool.
[01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:57.660]  He was on his way out.
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:00.060]  Okay, let's continue with the article.
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:00.900]  Where was I?
[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:02.860]  Duran was arrested on suspicion of first degree assault
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:05.300]  and police say he'll also will be issued a summons
[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:06.540]  for the marijuana grow.
[01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:09.340]  He'll also be ordered to remove the grow, police say.
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:11.020]  Investigators say they are searching
[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:13.100]  for the teen's accomplice.
[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:17.220]  In August of 2014, a 13 year old boy was wounded by a man
[01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:19.940]  after allegedly trying to steal marijuana plants
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:21.460]  from a backyard.
[01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:23.100]  So you can see this is going to happen every year
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:26.060]  if we keep having these illegal outdoor grows.
[01:58:26.060 --> 01:58:27.700]  Just put it inside.
[01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:28.540]  Put it inside.
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:29.380]  Grow indoors.
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:30.200]  Nobody can see it.
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:32.020]  If you're doing it properly, nobody can smell it.
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:33.060]  Nobody knows it's there.
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:33.940]  You can control it.
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.260]  You can grow year round.
[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:38.220]  Right, just go get a carbon filter and a grow light
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:39.900]  and a grow book.
[01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:40.740]  Read the book.
[01:58:40.740 --> 01:58:41.940]  Listen to the show.
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:42.780]  Listen to the show.
[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:44.600]  I know the sun is free, you guys,
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:47.860]  but you got to, if it, in the city of Pueblo, it's illegal.
[01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:50.180]  And if you grow and it gets, something like this happens,
[01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:52.480]  it puts a black eye on our entire industry,
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:54.300]  our entire community, on the plant,
[01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:55.800]  on the movement, on everything.
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:57.780]  Somebody got shot over some weed
[01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:00.180]  because somebody was growing it outside.
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:03.300]  Okay, just for the ballpark,
[01:59:03.300 --> 01:59:05.560]  a decent little grow setup for six plants
[01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:06.740]  is gonna run your what?
[01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:08.860]  The best gear, three grand?
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:10.660]  Oh dude, I can set you up ready to grow
[01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:12.780]  for less than a thousand bucks.
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:14.260]  Right, but like if you went with the best,
[01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:15.380]  like three or four?
[01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:17.220]  Oh, 25.
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:20.660]  How much would you pay to not just sweat
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:22.100]  for six months, eight months,
[01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:23.180]  while your plants are out back?
[01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:24.000]  Right.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.300]  What if someone's gonna steal your effort?
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:26.740]  That's the truth.
[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:29.180]  For me, it's definitely worth more than a grand or two.
[01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:32.060]  And if you think about it this way,
[01:59:32.060 --> 01:59:33.980]  if you're growing enough outside
[01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:36.340]  to make it worth shooting somebody for it,
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:41.020]  you are doing, you're growing more than you need, probably.
[01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:42.860]  Maybe you're growing your entire year's supply.
[01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:46.420]  I can't judge you, but think about the situation.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:48.220]  If you're growing that much,
[01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:49.820]  you might be asking for something
[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:51.220]  if you're trying to get greedy.
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:53.180]  You might be inviting trouble
[01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:55.340]  if you're trying to get greedy, is what I think I'm saying.
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:58.260]  Right, this dude's gonna end up harvesting enough weed
[01:59:58.260 --> 02:00:00.100]  to get him until he's gotta turn himself in
[02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:02.700]  to go to jail, like it sucks.
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:03.540]  That does suck.
[02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:05.460]  He decided to shoot the kid trying to steal his weed
[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:07.540]  and now he's gonna end up in jail for it.
[02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:09.260]  The kid's going to jail for trying to steal it.
[02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:10.580]  Like it's just shitty all around
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:13.220]  because this dude wanted to skirt the law
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:14.420]  in a place where it's legal.
[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:19.420]  Yeah, let's change, let's just change the item being stolen
[02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:22.380]  from, excuse me guys, sorry.
[02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:26.820]  Let's change this item from cannabis plants to a car.
[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:31.140]  If it goes down like this, everybody's still going to jail.
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:33.540]  Yeah, but would you have shot at somebody
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:34.500]  stealing your car?
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:37.980]  I have a feeling this guy would have.
[02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:38.820]  Yeah, okay.
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:41.500]  No, we had an incident in the city a couple of years ago.
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:42.580]  It got a whole lot of press
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:45.380]  because it was particularly brutal.
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:47.260]  This guy kind of lived in the middle of nowhere
[02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:50.260]  and had a trash pile with a bunch of scrap metal in it.
[02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:52.780]  And people kept pulling up in the middle of the night
[02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:54.500]  and stealing his scrap metal.
[02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:57.860]  So one night he got his rifle and turned all the lights off.
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:00:59.380]  And when the pickup truck showed up
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:01.180]  and people climbed out and turned flashlights on,
[02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:02.820]  he opened fire and he killed one of them,
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:05.020]  wounded another one, held one of them at gunpoint
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:06.580]  until the cops got there.
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:09.240]  And was looking at like first degree murder charges
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:11.780]  because that's first degree murder.
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.180]  You can't lie in wait and kill people.
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:15.020]  Even if they're stealing from you.
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.060]  Plan the fuck out of that.
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:20.900]  I don't know, it's just Pueblo people.
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:22.300]  It's just, oh man.
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:23.780]  But this is going to happen all over the country.
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:25.860]  It just happened in Oregon too.
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:27.460]  It's ripper season, you guys.
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:31.420]  That's a big part of growing marijuana.
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:33.820]  It used to be because it was illegal,
[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:36.220]  but it was always also because marijuana's
[02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:37.140]  worth a lot of money,
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:39.700]  especially in places where it isn't legal.
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:41.500]  And if you can steal it from someone,
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:44.420]  your cost is zero and you can take it somewhere
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:46.860]  where you can sell it for six, 8,000 a pound.
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:49.180]  So people are going to try to steal it.
[02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:51.020]  And the people that are going to try to steal it
[02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:51.860]  are shitheads.
[02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:54.260]  Some of these guys are professionals.
[02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:55.860]  Yep, there are people who do it for a living.
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:59.100]  I was told a story of somebody who got into a greenhouse
[02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:01.060]  with a polyvinyl cover.
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:03.660]  I don't know exactly what that shit's called,
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:05.500]  but greenhouse covering, thick covering.
[02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:08.220]  They cut a three foot tall slit in the cover,
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:09.700]  just a slit, three feet tall.
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:12.700]  And they took every fucking plant out of the greenhouse,
[02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:15.740]  did not leave a footprint nor a leaf behind
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:17.740]  and cleaned the entire greenhouse out.
[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:19.860]  These guys are professionals.
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:21.340]  There are experienced rippers out there
[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:23.500]  and they're at work all for the next week or two,
[02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:25.380]  just taking crops that are finished.
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:27.260]  All right, I hope you guys get your plants cut down.
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:28.620]  Dude, if someone comes to steal your plants,
[02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:29.460]  please don't shoot them.
[02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:30.380]  Don't go to jail.
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:31.220]  Really think about it.
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:32.060]  It's so not worth it.
[02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:33.460]  Really, really think about what you're going to do.
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:34.300]  Do not go to jail.
[02:02:34.300 --> 02:02:36.740]  And earlier I said, let your dogs out.
[02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:37.580]  Don't let your dogs out.
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:39.260]  If you let your dog out and your dog bites somebody,
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:40.660]  you got to put your dog down.
[02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:42.100]  So, and that person may shoot your dog.
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:44.100]  So just keep the dog in the house.
[02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:47.700]  Yep, like there's a, there's really not a great option here.
[02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:49.260]  Like that's one of the things that sucks.
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:50.580]  Call the cops.
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:51.420]  Call the police.
[02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:53.780]  Yeah, if you've got, I guess so, huh?
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:54.940]  Or grow indoors.
[02:02:55.860 --> 02:02:59.140]  We just had a guy get shot for confronting some taggers
[02:02:59.140 --> 02:02:59.980]  in the alley.
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:02.980]  So I'm really kind of anti, you know,
[02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:06.740]  doing anything right now other than like bringing official,
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:07.580]  if that's what they're there for.
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:08.420]  Just call the cops.
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:09.980]  Don't try to be a vigilante.
[02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:12.740]  And I always hated the not doing it because I had weed.
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:16.460]  There were so many times where I was like, I should.
[02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:18.900]  And I didn't because I had weed or smelled like weed
[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:19.820]  or just smoked.
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:20.980]  Right, yeah.
[02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:23.340]  Sometimes I've had to just call 911 and say,
[02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:25.100]  hey, there's a car upside down on the interstate.
[02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:26.100]  And like, why don't you stop?
[02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:27.300]  Cause I'm high as fuck.
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:31.380]  All right, you guys.
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:32.540]  Gosh, excuse my throat, Claire.
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:35.540]  And I'm going to give it one good one and I'll be done.
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:36.900]  No, that was just exaggerating.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:37.860]  I think I'm good though.
[02:03:38.380 --> 02:03:40.540]  All right, that's enough talking about shooting people.
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:41.460]  That's the bad news.
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:42.780]  Let's find-
[02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:44.100]  This is some not great news.
[02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:45.820]  Yeah, not great news.
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:49.220]  This one, I was saying that we're not going to talk
[02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:51.540]  about the spot on this episode, but guess what?
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:52.460]  The spot-
[02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:54.500]  Will be used as an example in the following.
[02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:58.300]  The spot passed all these tests with flying colors.
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:00.180]  We did not get any violations.
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:01.940]  Everything is legit at the spot.
[02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:03.100]  We are champions.
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:04.420]  So with that being said,
[02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:06.380]  the headline for this article is
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:10.820]  seven Denver marijuana shops cited for underage sales.
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:13.060]  The byline is police say they conducted checks
[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:15.780]  on 30 Denver retail marijuana shops on Friday.
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:18.300]  I found this article on The Cannabis.
[02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:23.140]  This article is written by Jesse Paul of the Denver Post.
[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:25.020]  I actually first heard of this
[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:27.140]  from our good friend, Dave Munn.
[02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:28.900]  So shout out to Dave for putting me
[02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:30.540]  on the case to find this one.
[02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:31.420]  Yep.
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:32.980]  Dave's a good dude.
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:35.180]  Nipples are sticking out, Dave.
[02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:36.860]  Just wanted to let you know.
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:37.700]  All right.
[02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:39.020]  So this article says,
[02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:40.860]  Denver police issued seven citations
[02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:42.580]  for underage retail marijuana sales
[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:43.700]  during an enforcement operation
[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:46.460]  at 30 shops last week, officials said on Wednesday.
[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:48.540]  Police say they conducted checks Friday
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:51.020]  in an effort to audit any potential underage sales
[02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:54.140]  and found there to be lower underage compliance rate.
[02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:56.060]  To be a lower underage compliance rates.
[02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:57.500]  Sorry, I read that wonky.
[02:04:57.500 --> 02:04:59.220]  We are disappointed, said Louis Koski,
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:01.820]  director of Colorado's marijuana enforcement division
[02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:02.940]  in a statement.
[02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:04.660]  Up until now, these compliance checks
[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:06.620]  have been a bright spot for the industry.
[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:10.980]  This recent check drops compliance to 92%.
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:13.380]  Yeah, we were at 99 before, fuckheads.
[02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:15.980]  Fuckheads making us look bad.
[02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:17.460]  The news comes as a blow
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:19.220]  to recreational marijuana in Colorado,
[02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:22.340]  especially since in the roughly 21 months
[02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:24.380]  since recreational marijuana has been legal,
[02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:27.140]  stores mostly have been lauded for their compliance.
[02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:28.780]  Owners and operators have been praised
[02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:30.580]  for their handling of the hot button topic
[02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:33.420]  of underage possession and consumption.
[02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:37.660]  So in Colorado, what they're mainly worried about is this,
[02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:39.860]  weed being sold to people who are not 21
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:43.340]  and also weed being sold out the back door of the dispensary
[02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:44.740]  that isn't being documented.
[02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:48.940]  Underage sales and product and leaving a shop
[02:05:48.940 --> 02:05:51.540]  headed out of state, you know, in bulk.
[02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:52.380]  In bulk, yeah.
[02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:54.260]  Is the, or are the two things
[02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:58.660]  that we're really, really, really seeking to avoid here?
[02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:00.620]  They call those the fatal flaws.
[02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:01.460]  Yep.
[02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:03.820]  Those are things that will trigger federal intervention
[02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:05.020]  if they get out of hand.
[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:06.540]  Yes.
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:08.980]  And I mean, just in my world,
[02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:12.500]  all of the anti-pot people love shit like this.
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:15.380]  Like it doesn't matter that we only drop down
[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:17.780]  percentage wise to in line with alcohol
[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:19.500]  and tobacco retailers.
[02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:21.860]  Like all three of those businesses
[02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:25.980]  sit at about a 92% compliance rate, like 90 to 92.
[02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:27.900]  And we're at 92 now, thanks to this.
[02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:30.980]  We were at 99, thanks to Aspen dipshits.
[02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:34.940]  There were two shops in Aspen that were busted a while ago.
[02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:36.740]  After they were busted,
[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:39.100]  pretty much every shop in the state got a letter saying,
[02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:42.220]  hey, make sure your ID check system is up to stuff.
[02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:44.380]  We're doing compliance checks.
[02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:46.020]  We're not trying to scam you.
[02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:49.420]  Like they're not gonna pretend that they're 21
[02:06:49.420 --> 02:06:51.140]  and show a fake ID or something.
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:54.460]  It's, it'll be an under 21 ID and you'll fuck it up.
[02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:55.860]  And that's how you get stung.
[02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:58.900]  And in the state of Colorado, our IDs are.
[02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:00.100]  Vertical, horizontal.
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:02.260]  Yeah, if you're over 21, it fits one way on the card.
[02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:03.580]  And if you're under 21, it fits.
[02:07:03.580 --> 02:07:05.260]  Yeah, so that should be obvious.
[02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:06.100]  I can see how.
[02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:07.220]  You have to look at the verticals.
[02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:09.540]  Like I just had a family member turn 21
[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:12.140]  and her ID is still good for several months.
[02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:12.980]  Okay.
[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:15.380]  So you've got to read the date, but how it's not hard.
[02:07:15.380 --> 02:07:16.220]  Happy birthday.
[02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:17.060]  I know who you are.
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:17.900]  Happy birthday.
[02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:19.340]  Everybody go get a little flip calendar
[02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:22.100]  with the you can't buy shit here if you was born before.
[02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:22.940]  Yeah, that's all you need.
[02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:23.780]  It ain't hard.
[02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:24.820]  You should have somebody up front
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:27.060]  who's trained and experienced in checking IDs.
[02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:29.140]  Right, we have armed security checking every ID
[02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:30.020]  that comes to the store.
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:32.180]  And we turn away 65 year olds all the time
[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:34.380]  because their ID expired a week ago.
[02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.300]  This is how strict our shop is.
[02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:37.860]  And I know we said we weren't gonna talk about the spot,
[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:40.660]  but this is an example of what should be done.
[02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:42.220]  You gotta do it right right now.
[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:45.180]  The fire inspector showed up and the fire inspector said,
[02:07:45.180 --> 02:07:46.900]  hey, I'm here to look in the back of the building.
[02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:48.740]  And the security guard said, and who are you?
[02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:49.820]  And he said, I'm the fire inspector.
[02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:52.340]  And the security guard said, sir, can I see your ID?
[02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:53.340]  And he said, I don't have an ID.
[02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:54.620]  I'm the fire inspector.
[02:07:54.620 --> 02:07:56.140]  And the security guard stuck out his hand and said,
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:57.260]  I'm John, I'm the security guard.
[02:07:57.260 --> 02:07:58.100]  Good to meet you.
[02:07:58.100 --> 02:07:59.340]  Can I see your ID?
[02:07:59.660 --> 02:08:01.100]  And the guy was like, I'm the fire inspector.
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:02.020]  I don't need an ID.
[02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:03.260]  And he goes, I don't know who you are.
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:05.740]  You can't come in here and sent the fire inspector away
[02:08:05.740 --> 02:08:07.820]  because he didn't have proper identification.
[02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:10.820]  He was in a fire truck, but dude didn't have ID.
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:11.900]  So we can't let him in there.
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:12.980]  That's-
[02:08:12.980 --> 02:08:13.820]  Period.
[02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:14.660]  Yeah, period.
[02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:15.500]  That's the rule.
[02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:16.580]  You don't have ID, you can't come in.
[02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:17.420]  We don't care.
[02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:18.860]  You could be Barack fucking Obama.
[02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:20.060]  And I don't think we'd let you in there
[02:08:20.060 --> 02:08:21.500]  unless you pull out that ID.
[02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:24.020]  We had cops come to the shop
[02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:27.340]  because a crazy guy said we stole his wallet one day
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:29.580]  and the security guard checked their IDs.
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:31.180]  It was really funny to watch.
[02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:33.140]  All of the bud tenders were standing there like,
[02:08:33.140 --> 02:08:34.580]  dude, he's really checking their IDs.
[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:35.740]  It's the third one in a row.
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:37.140]  He's getting his wallet out.
[02:08:37.140 --> 02:08:38.420]  He's pulling out his driver's license
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:40.020]  and giving it to our security guard.
[02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:40.860]  That's awesome.
[02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:41.700]  This is crazy.
[02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:42.900]  Shout out to whichever security guard that was.
[02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:43.740]  Yep.
[02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:44.580]  That's a good job.
[02:08:44.580 --> 02:08:45.820]  It's everyone that comes in gets ID'd.
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:47.540]  If your ID is expired, you can't come in.
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:48.380]  Not at all.
[02:08:48.380 --> 02:08:49.340]  If you're not 21, you can't come in.
[02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:50.180]  Yep.
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:53.300]  Every shop in the legal industry needs to be able to do this.
[02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:54.300]  It's not complicated.
[02:08:54.300 --> 02:08:57.100]  We make vendors wait in the entry room
[02:08:57.860 --> 02:08:58.700]  if they don't have their ID with them.
[02:08:58.700 --> 02:09:00.420]  No, you cannot go back to the offices.
[02:09:00.420 --> 02:09:02.140]  You have to wait right here in this chair.
[02:09:02.140 --> 02:09:04.140]  We'll come and then we make them wait
[02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:05.340]  if they have a delivery for us
[02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:06.180]  and they don't have their ID.
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:08.700]  We handle everybody else first and then we get them.
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:09.900]  All right, let's get back to this article.
[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:11.340]  We were talking a little bit about the spot.
[02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:12.180]  We said we weren't gonna.
[02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:14.820]  We're just praising the rules that were followed.
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:16.420]  In Washington State, by comparison,
[02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:18.660]  which legalized recreational marijuana at the same time,
[02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:21.540]  Colorado did, but implemented recreational sales
[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:24.300]  six months later, several stores have been reprimanded
[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:25.820]  for selling to minors.
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:28.300]  Kostosky said, despite a lack of repeat violations
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:31.260]  at any one licensed shop, this represents a downward trend
[02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:33.820]  in compliance that is concerning.
[02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:35.060]  That is very true.
[02:09:35.060 --> 02:09:37.100]  We've been at it for just over almost two years now.
[02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:38.380]  Holy shit, time flies.
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:40.780]  There was a lot of information in that last paragraph.
[02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:44.500]  They're re-stinging, purposefully re-stinging businesses
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:47.940]  that failed to make sure that they're back in compliance
[02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:48.820]  where they need to be.
[02:09:48.820 --> 02:09:50.300]  Yes.
[02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:52.180]  Another piece of information you might enjoy,
[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:57.020]  dear listeners, is if you're a tobacco or alcohol retailer,
[02:09:57.020 --> 02:10:01.060]  the fine's usually about 10,000 for screwing up an ID check.
[02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:03.100]  If you're a marijuana retailer,
[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:05.980]  the first two penalties you face are $100,000 fine,
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:07.420]  and you can lose your license.
[02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:09.100]  $100,000.
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:11.500]  So it's 10 times the fine if you screw this up
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:12.740]  as a marijuana business.
[02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:14.020]  That could close a shop.
[02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:15.820]  Yeah.
[02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:17.900]  That could absolutely close a smaller dispensary.
[02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:18.740]  That could shut it down.
[02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:20.460]  A new dispensary, they could be gone.
[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:21.580]  Yeah.
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:23.980]  I know a lot of shops that that would have closed down
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:24.940]  in their first year.
[02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:26.100]  That would have closed down.
[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:27.900]  Mike and I worked, we met each other.
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:28.740]  Well, I don't know.
[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:30.420]  We became good friends through-
[02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:31.860]  That probably would have closed Metamar.
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:33.100]  That would have destroyed Metamar.
[02:10:33.100 --> 02:10:34.740]  They would have, yeah, $100,000 fine.
[02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:36.260]  That would have just closed that place down.
[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:37.100]  Yep.
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:38.780]  I would have been hungry.
[02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:40.500]  All right, I'm going to continue with the article here.
[02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:41.860]  It says, when reached by phone,
[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:43.780]  representatives at five of the shops cited
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:45.380]  either declined to immediately comment
[02:10:45.380 --> 02:10:47.300]  or said they could not discuss the citations
[02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:50.340]  because of ongoing criminal investigations.
[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:51.820]  Obviously, we failed on our mission
[02:10:51.820 --> 02:10:53.740]  to keep people under 21 out of our shop,
[02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:57.580]  said Ryan Fowler, owner of the cited store, Red Eye Relief.
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:59.380]  I'm incredibly disappointed.
[02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:01.540]  I must say, I like the name Red Eye Relief.
[02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:03.540]  That sounds like something I would have said.
[02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:05.900]  I drive by two of these shops regularly.
[02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:09.220]  When I'm in Denver, I almost stopped at one of them
[02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:11.300]  the last time I was up in Denver just a few days ago.
[02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:12.940]  Should have stopped, they would have let you in.
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:16.020]  So, Fowler said, four employees,
[02:11:16.020 --> 02:11:17.100]  including a store manager,
[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:18.900]  were fired in the citations wake.
[02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:21.220]  He added, the shop will stop accepting
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:22.820]  vertical identification cards
[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:24.740]  and begin using electronic verification
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:27.300]  to ensure there are no underage customers.
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:30.140]  So, even if you're 21 and you have a vertical card,
[02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:32.500]  they're not going to let you in.
[02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:34.500]  Yep, which is nonsense.
[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:37.940]  You can fully let in people that are 21 and you should.
[02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:41.540]  They're perfectly legally allowed to shop in your business.
[02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:43.780]  Same thing with the electronic card reader.
[02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:46.700]  If you can't look at the date and see what it says,
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:48.620]  the electronic card reader ain't going to help you.
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:50.340]  Yep.
[02:11:50.340 --> 02:11:51.180]  It shows your age.
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:52.380]  Actually, when you slide that card reader,
[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:53.860]  it shows the actual age.
[02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:55.460]  Yeah, but if you can't read a year,
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:57.020]  can you read a number at all?
[02:11:57.020 --> 02:11:57.940]  That's true.
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:00.060]  You guys, there are a few dispensaries.
[02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:02.940]  If you come to Colorado and you shop at a dispensary,
[02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:04.700]  there are a few that run your card
[02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:07.260]  through that little card reader like they have at the bar.
[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:09.980]  That thing does not save any information, you guys.
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:11.380]  It does not save any information.
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:13.260]  It scans your ID and it processes the information
[02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:14.860]  on your ID and then it shows how old you are.
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:16.060]  That's all it does.
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:17.140]  A lot of people are paranoid
[02:12:17.140 --> 02:12:18.860]  that that thing is showing your ID.
[02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:21.100]  It does not, or that it's keeping your information.
[02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:21.940]  It does not.
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:23.540]  We're not allowed, the dispensaries are not allowed
[02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:24.900]  to track your information.
[02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:27.060]  The only thing that we do keep track of
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:29.340]  is oftentimes dispensaries will document
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:31.100]  what state you are from,
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:33.620]  and that is mostly for advertising
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:35.420]  and just marketing purposes.
[02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:36.940]  So we're not keeping your information.
[02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:38.180]  We don't want to know where you live.
[02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:39.460]  We don't care.
[02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:41.740]  We're out of room for records.
[02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:42.700]  Good shit.
[02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:46.900]  Not to be a dick about it, but we're sort of busy.
[02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:49.780]  We don't have time to even process that information,
[02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:51.060]  let alone compile it.
[02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:53.740]  A need or anything to do with it either.
[02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:55.820]  All right, I'm going to get back into this article.
[02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:57.620]  Where was I?
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:12:59.260]  There we go.
[02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:00.260]  We are very concerned about this matter,
[02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:02.540]  the Healing House said in a statement to the Denver Post.
[02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:04.700]  We are 100% committed to compliance
[02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:06.340]  in all aspects of the law.
[02:13:06.340 --> 02:13:07.820]  We have had no issues in the past
[02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:10.580]  and we are taking this matter very seriously.
[02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:12.700]  Officials say the citations for selling marijuana
[02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:14.140]  to a person younger than 21
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:16.700]  were issued at seven separate businesses.
[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:19.180]  The charge is a class one misdemeanor.
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:21.460]  Oh, so they could also face criminal charges, huh?
[02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:23.420]  The person who made the sale
[02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:26.260]  has already been cited with a criminal charge
[02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:27.500]  and they'll be going to court for it.
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:30.500]  Now, I know we say we're not going to talk about the spot,
[02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:33.060]  but when you walk into most dispensaries,
[02:13:33.060 --> 02:13:35.580]  there's a security guard up front checking IDs.
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:38.980]  Then he sends you back to the bud tender who sells you bud.
[02:13:40.060 --> 02:13:41.500]  Then he rings you up.
[02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:43.820]  Who's responsible there for that?
[02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:46.380]  The security guard or the bud tender?
[02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:48.300]  The bud tender.
[02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:50.300]  You should be checking an ID again?
[02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:54.980]  We totally ask if we're at all worried about it.
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:57.220]  We have a lot of faith in our security guards.
[02:13:57.220 --> 02:14:00.860]  We don't at all tolerate the security guard
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:03.340]  not doing his job perfectly.
[02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:06.260]  Right, most of those guys are military guys.
[02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:08.020]  The whole company's ex-military.
[02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:10.460]  Everyone in that company is a vet.
[02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:13.580]  So they're used to doing everything perfect
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:15.460]  when they have to at work.
[02:14:15.940 --> 02:14:18.580]  It's simply done correctly every time.
[02:14:18.580 --> 02:14:19.940]  We still ask from time to time.
[02:14:19.940 --> 02:14:21.820]  We've got a couple of people that come in the shop
[02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:23.980]  that look very, very young.
[02:14:23.980 --> 02:14:27.780]  And they're both well over 21, but they don't look it.
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:30.180]  And so every time there's a new bud tender there,
[02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:33.860]  and even sometimes when there's just a lot of people there,
[02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:35.620]  we want everybody to be confident
[02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:37.540]  that we're not selling to under 21 people.
[02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:39.860]  We'll just, hey, can I see your ID again real quick, man?
[02:14:39.860 --> 02:14:41.660]  I'm sorry, I just got to be sure.
[02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:43.100]  It's my bud on the line.
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:45.820]  True, yeah, and you're way too pretty for jail.
[02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:47.700]  Yeah, it's like, I really like you, dude,
[02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:49.060]  but you're not worth 100K.
[02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:50.460]  No, or your job.
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:54.500]  Yep, this $40 sale is not worth $100,000 fine and my job.
[02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:55.340]  Right, yeah.
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:56.300]  And the criminal charge.
[02:14:56.300 --> 02:14:58.140]  And us being on the news.
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:14:59.420]  All right, I'm gonna continue with the article.
[02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:01.180]  And then I just realized that at the bottom of the article,
[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:03.380]  I didn't see this when I skimmed through this the first time,
[02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:05.620]  all of the shops are listed.
[02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:06.460]  I like it.
[02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:07.280]  So avoid them.
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:09.660]  Yeah, or if you're not 21, go there.
[02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:11.380]  No, I'm just kidding, don't do that.
[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:15.100]  So it says, those dispensaries need to be held accountable,
[02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:15.940]  said Tyler Henson,
[02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:18.620]  president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce.
[02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:20.140]  Your job as an owner and operator
[02:15:20.140 --> 02:15:23.580]  is to ensure your employees are readily trained.
[02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:25.300]  That can't happen again, he added.
[02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:27.180]  Henson said employers and their employees
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:29.620]  need to understand what's at stake here.
[02:15:29.620 --> 02:15:32.740]  Officials say the violations can mean a license suspension,
[02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:34.780]  a fine per individual violation,
[02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:37.940]  a fine in lieu of suspension up to $100,000
[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:40.340]  and license revocation.
[02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:42.860]  Man, that sounds so serious when you put it like that.
[02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:44.140]  I mean, think about it, dude.
[02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:46.700]  What did the one shop down here do
[02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:48.940]  that got their license pulled?
[02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:50.060]  On-site consumption.
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:50.900]  On-site consumption.
[02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:52.460]  And it wasn't like they were giving out dabs
[02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:53.580]  in the bedroom.
[02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:54.540]  Nope.
[02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:56.860]  They had roaches in an employee bathroom
[02:15:56.860 --> 02:16:00.860]  and it was enough for them to lose two store licenses.
[02:16:00.860 --> 02:16:04.660]  Underage sales, they haven't closed the shop
[02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:05.480]  that I know of yet,
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:07.140]  but I don't think any of the cases
[02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:08.780]  that have screwed this up
[02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:11.100]  have gone through that process completely yet.
[02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:13.740]  Time will tell, it's brand new.
[02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:14.580]  Yep.
[02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:16.100]  My guess is a couple of people
[02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:17.260]  are gonna lose their license.
[02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:19.540]  If you get stung twice, I would bet on it.
[02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:21.620]  Oh yeah, twice, they should, yeah, yeah.
[02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:23.620]  So it says sanctions may also include restrictions
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:26.500]  on the license, police said in a news release.
[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:28.240]  Investigators say they will file the cases
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:30.180]  with the Denver City Attorney's Office,
[02:16:30.180 --> 02:16:31.820]  which could issue its own discipline,
[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:35.020]  ranging from license suspension to license revocation.
[02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.980]  According to the Colorado Department of Revenue,
[02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:38.380]  the Marijuana Enforcement Division
[02:16:38.380 --> 02:16:41.540]  has conducted 172 compliance checks
[02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:46.540]  since January 1st of 2014 and found 16 total violations.
[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:50.340]  So it goes on to say,
[02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:52.860]  Denver marijuana shops were cited,
[02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:54.500]  where citations were issued,
[02:16:54.500 --> 02:16:55.340]  and then it lists them.
[02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:58.900]  It says, the Herbal Cure on South Logan Street,
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:00.940]  the Healing House on South Downing,
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:04.020]  Pure Medical Dispensary on 40th Avenue,
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:08.580]  Le Conte's Clone Bar and Dispensary on East 7th.
[02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:11.660]  That's over by where they host the Cannabis Cup.
[02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:15.820]  Herbs For You on East 9th, Mile High Green Cross.
[02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:18.940]  Those guys have a Cannabis Cup, so does Le Conte's.
[02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:19.920]  There are a couple of places on here
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:21.940]  that have Cannabis Cups that are professionals,
[02:17:21.940 --> 02:17:24.180]  that have a reputation, that are fucking up.
[02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:27.820]  I don't know how the fuck some of these shops mess this up.
[02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:30.620]  Red Eye Relief on South Cherokee Street.
[02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:33.460]  You know, we can chalk a couple of them up
[02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:37.340]  to a lazy employee or somebody up at the front,
[02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:39.620]  not giving a shit, and you just hand them an ID,
[02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:42.860]  and like, they look, I've been not old enough
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:45.380]  and gotten into clubs just by handing the bouncer an ID.
[02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:47.980]  Here, it was my ID that said I was not 21,
[02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:49.420]  and he's like, oh, you got an ID, here,
[02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:50.260]  and just hands it back.
[02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:52.100]  Because like you said, some people aren't fucking smart
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:55.500]  enough to read an ID to figure out that 1970 whatever
[02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:56.740]  means you're this how old.
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:59.220]  You know, people can't do that math in their head sometimes.
[02:17:59.220 --> 02:18:01.860]  So we can give a couple of those just to dumb employees.
[02:18:01.860 --> 02:18:04.300]  Some of it's just, one or two is probably
[02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:06.260]  just somebody letting somebody slip through.
[02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:07.700]  Just needing to make a sale.
[02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:09.260]  Mm-hmm.
[02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:10.380]  Like, I don't know what it is,
[02:18:10.380 --> 02:18:14.380]  but if selling to people under 21
[02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:16.620]  is part of your business model, you can go.
[02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:20.140]  Yeah, we're trying to set a positive standard here
[02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:21.300]  and do things correctly.
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:24.300]  We're literally front and center on the world stage
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:28.940]  when other nations bring up marijuana legalization
[02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:32.500]  as an idea or a concept that they might wanna pursue.
[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:34.460]  They discuss what's happening in Colorado.
[02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:36.020]  Yes, we are the model.
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:40.260]  Every now and then, I hear about someone from France
[02:18:40.260 --> 02:18:43.940]  or London coming through Pueblo and taking a look
[02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:46.140]  at what we're doing here in Pueblo,
[02:18:46.140 --> 02:18:48.060]  which this never would have happened five years ago.
[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:48.900]  True.
[02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:50.220]  There's no reason for any of these people to be here.
[02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:51.060]  Very true.
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:52.100]  And be interested in what we're doing,
[02:18:52.100 --> 02:18:55.060]  but they're coming here to see how marijuana legalization
[02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:56.980]  works in practice.
[02:18:56.980 --> 02:19:00.060]  And if they see teenagers waiting in line,
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:02.460]  it's not going well.
[02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:04.780]  It's not gonna spread, and it should.
[02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:06.300]  That's the truth.
[02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:07.700]  All right, you guys, we've got one more article
[02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:08.660]  that I wanna get in.
[02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:10.500]  We've been going for close to 40 minutes.
[02:19:10.500 --> 02:19:11.500]  We can get this one in here.
[02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:12.340]  No, I like it.
[02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:13.380]  The people seem to like,
[02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:14.580]  when I've got somebody else with me,
[02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:15.580]  they'll listen a little longer.
[02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:16.820]  So what does it just mean?
[02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:18.300]  About 36 minutes is the limit.
[02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:19.980]  When there's two of us, they'll listen.
[02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:21.340]  That's good news times, folks.
[02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:22.860]  So let's start this one off
[02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:25.340]  with a big congratulations to Oregon.
[02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:26.820]  Welcome to the club, Oregon.
[02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:31.260]  Oregon enters recreational era with tax-free pot sales.
[02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:33.580]  October 1st documented the beginning
[02:19:33.580 --> 02:19:36.300]  of recreational pot sales in the state of Oregon.
[02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:38.300]  I've got a lot of friends out there.
[02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:40.660]  Big shout out to my Oregon crew, the PNW crew.
[02:19:40.660 --> 02:19:41.500]  Hope you guys are out there
[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:44.380]  enjoying recreational cannabis sales.
[02:19:44.380 --> 02:19:46.700]  So I've got an article, once again, from the cannabis.
[02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:48.660]  This was written by Jonathan J. Cooper
[02:19:48.660 --> 02:19:51.540]  and Bob Sevey of the Associated Press.
[02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:55.100]  It's like a cool pair of names.
[02:19:55.140 --> 02:19:58.140]  Jonathan J. Cooper and Bob Sevey.
[02:19:58.140 --> 02:19:58.980]  Yeah, all right.
[02:19:58.980 --> 02:20:01.460]  Just when I think I was going and ready for another dab,
[02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:02.940]  you say some really high shit
[02:20:02.940 --> 02:20:04.620]  and remind me why that's probably not a great idea.
[02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:05.460]  You want to take a dab?
[02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:06.300]  Fuck it, let's take a dab, dude.
[02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:08.900]  Let's celebrate Oregon's recreational cannabis
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:10.020]  by taking a dab.
[02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:11.060]  Yeah, I'm going to- Sounds good to me.
[02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:12.340]  Consider my arm twisted.
[02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:14.100]  Yeah, I'll twist the shit out of it.
[02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:15.460]  We've got two rigs on the table.
[02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:16.860]  I'll let you hit the e-nail
[02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:17.940]  and then I'll go ahead and take the one
[02:20:17.940 --> 02:20:18.860]  that requires a torch.
[02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:19.700]  You got a dab over there?
[02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:21.500]  Or you need a carb cap? I do just carb cap, man.
[02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:24.060]  I'm going to take myself a medium, shmedium dab.
[02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:24.900]  Shmedium dab.
[02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:28.140]  Hey guys, I want you to take a dab with me first of all,
[02:20:28.140 --> 02:20:30.780]  but then I want you to find me on social media,
[02:20:30.780 --> 02:20:33.060]  either Facebook or Twitter,
[02:20:33.060 --> 02:20:35.500]  or you can even email me if you want.
[02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:37.540]  But I want to know how big of a dab do you take?
[02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:39.100]  Do you take a 0.1?
[02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:40.740]  Do you take a 0.2?
[02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:42.540]  Do you take a 0.3?
[02:20:42.540 --> 02:20:44.340]  Do you take 0.4?
[02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:46.740]  Or do you do a fucking half gram dab?
[02:20:46.740 --> 02:20:47.580]  Tell me what you think.
[02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:48.980]  I want to know about it.
[02:20:48.980 --> 02:20:50.740]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:20:50.740 --> 02:20:53.140]  You can find me on Facebook, it's Grow From Your Heart.
[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:55.220]  Or if you want to search me out on Twitter,
[02:20:55.220 --> 02:20:58.540]  find me on the little Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[02:20:58.540 --> 02:21:01.060]  Let me know how big of a dab you prefer to take.
[02:21:01.060 --> 02:21:02.980]  So you're looking for regular dab size,
[02:21:02.980 --> 02:21:06.420]  not this one time my friend dared me to take a...
[02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:07.620]  Well, I want to know, yeah, yeah.
[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:09.580]  Like what, if you're about to just pull off a dab
[02:21:09.580 --> 02:21:11.500]  for yourself, if it's your normal day, if you're dabbing,
[02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:13.340]  I want to know what you pull off, what's your average.
[02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:14.980]  And then tell me how many of those you take
[02:21:14.980 --> 02:21:16.780]  in a dab session also.
[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:18.100]  Because if you take a half gram
[02:21:18.100 --> 02:21:20.660]  and you only take one of them, then that's cool.
[02:21:20.660 --> 02:21:23.340]  If you take 5.1s, that's cool also.
[02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:24.820]  I just want to know how you do it.
[02:21:24.820 --> 02:21:25.820]  I'm just curious.
[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:29.900]  I myself like to take a whole bunch of .3s.
[02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:31.940]  Like .3 is about where I like to be.
[02:21:31.940 --> 02:21:32.780]  And I like to take a bunch of them,
[02:21:32.780 --> 02:21:34.980]  like about six or seven of them sometimes.
[02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:37.420]  On a lunch break, I'll take 3.3s
[02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:39.300]  is what I like for a lunch break.
[02:21:39.300 --> 02:21:40.140]  I'm going to take a dab right now.
[02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:41.380]  Right now I'm hitting the hit man.
[02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:42.220]  Let's do this.
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:47.200]  Oh, that hits really well.
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:48.960]  Y'all remember how bad I cough?
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:49.800]  No cough.
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:52.040]  Little cough.
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:55.760]  So recently I picked up a Mothership knockoff.
[02:21:55.760 --> 02:21:58.640]  It's not really, it looks just like a Mothership Klein,
[02:21:58.640 --> 02:21:59.480]  but it was-
[02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:01.520]  It's thinner, I think.
[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:03.040]  Yeah, the glass may be a little thinner.
[02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:04.920]  Not so much the, well, yeah,
[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:06.440]  maybe a little bit the glass way too,
[02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:08.720]  but the overall size of the rig,
[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:11.640]  the cylinder going up is thinner in diameter.
[02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:12.480]  Okay.
[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:14.280]  Yeah, it may be a little bit shrunken of a ship,
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:17.960]  but it was a fifth of the price of a Mothership.
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:19.280]  Right, it hits like a truck.
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:20.120]  I like it a lot.
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:20.960]  Yeah, it hits a great rig.
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:22.760]  A shout out to Elevate in Colorado Springs.
[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:24.240]  I know I've said that once or twice at this show,
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:26.520]  but I've been buying a lot of glass from them
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:28.720]  and I appreciate the hookups.
[02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:30.960]  This little hit man hits like a goddamn truck.
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:32.440]  I'm trying to act like I'm not trying to choke
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:34.160]  and trying to act like I've got my breath together
[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:35.000]  and everything, but guess what?
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.480]  There's almost no resistance.
[02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:38.200]  It's straight from nail to lung.
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:39.280]  Oh, that, yeah.
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:40.560]  Some choke is just expected.
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:42.080]  You just get a fat rip every time.
[02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:44.880]  So I feel like I'm getting my brains back together.
[02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:46.320]  Sometimes you guys, when I take a big dab,
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:47.720]  it sounds like Charlie Brown's,
[02:22:47.720 --> 02:22:49.520]  the adults in the Charlie Brown cartoons.
[02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:54.480]  Or as what it sounds like after a big dab.
[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:57.280]  Sometimes it takes me a minute to dig through that hole,
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:22:58.120]  but I feel like I'm back.
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:22:59.720]  We are celebrating Oregon
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:01.920]  having recreational sales of cannabis, right?
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:04.040]  Welcome to the club, Northern Brothers.
[02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:04.880]  You're the cool kids now.
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:05.720]  And sisters.
[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:08.560]  All right, let's get into this article.
[02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:09.960]  This is from Portland, Oregon,
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:12.200]  and it says excited shoppers looking to score
[02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:13.880]  some of the first recreational marijuana
[02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:15.440]  sold legally in Oregon.
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:17.840]  Bought up baggies of bud early Thursday,
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:21.680]  taking advantage of door buster prices and other deals.
[02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:24.360]  Goddamn, that's such a poetic opening line
[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:25.840]  for a news article.
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:27.640]  Whoever wrote this is majestic.
[02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:29.480]  Or I'm high.
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:32.280]  Some of the more than 250 dispensaries
[02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:34.320]  that already offer medical marijuana in the state
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:37.040]  welcomed recreational users soon after midnight.
[02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:38.960]  Just moments after it became legal to sell
[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:41.480]  to anyone who is at least 21.
[02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:43.720]  It's a really long sentences in this article.
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:46.280]  So much for the majesty.
[02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:47.240]  Right?
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:50.040]  In the case of Nishongo Premium Cannabis in Portland,
[02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:52.360]  co-founder Shane McKee said the first sale
[02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:53.840]  came about a minute after midnight
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:55.560]  and many others quickly followed.
[02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:58.840]  I think it's not only historical for folks in Oregon,
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:23:59.720]  but nationwide.
[02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:01.160]  Anytime people start selling that
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:03.120]  as an alternative to alcohol or tobacco,
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:05.240]  he said in a telephone interview.
[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:08.440]  Brad Sussman, co-owner of Canna Daddies in Portland,
[02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:10.200]  said more than 90 customers bought pot
[02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:13.480]  in the first two hours after the store opened at 7 a.m.
[02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:15.440]  So people are out there at midnight,
[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:17.960]  buying weed out there at 7 a.m., buying weed.
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:19.400]  That's pretty neat.
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:21.560]  It's like when a new video game goes on sale.
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:22.400]  Something like that.
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:24.480]  Lines out the door, people just buying weed.
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:27.240]  I'm torn with this story.
[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:32.080]  First, I'm elated that another state
[02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:34.880]  has joined the legalization ranks.
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:37.240]  I'm glad they're celebrating.
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:40.600]  I'm glad people came out and that the lines were good.
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:42.600]  A lot of medical shops are converting,
[02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:44.800]  so supply might not be the problem.
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:48.040]  It's been in other legal states, which is awesome.
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:51.040]  But at the same time, it's time to knock off the shenanigans
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:53.200]  and step all the way up into the legal industry.
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:54.520]  You gotta put your best foot forward
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:56.440]  or you're gonna fuck it up for everyone.
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:57.640]  And there were a couple of things
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:24:59.000]  about the rollout in Oregon
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.480]  that could fuck it up for most of Oregon.
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:05.480]  Half of the state has banned shops, period.
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:09.000]  The other half of the state allows a shitload.
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.200]  And if you look at a map,
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:11.960]  it's like right down the fucking mountain range
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:14.120]  in the middle of the state.
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:17.560]  The coast side approves, and there's shops everywhere.
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:20.480]  The other side of the mountain range, not a single shop.
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:21.320]  Of course.
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:25.440]  And stuff like opening at midnight
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:27.840]  when there are hours that you're allowed to open
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:29.160]  and not allowed to be open,
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:31.480]  and they don't involve 1201 in the morning.
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:36.360]  There's the main reporter covering marijuana up there
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:37.920]  that I follow on Twitter.
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:40.520]  One of her colleagues was handed marijuana gummies
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:44.360]  outside of the shop, waiting in line, doing news reports.
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:46.520]  He was just handed free pot candy,
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:49.760]  pot edibles, specifically candy, are fucking banned.
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:50.960]  So are giveaways.
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:54.840]  And it's not like this stuff is world ending or shattering.
[02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:56.760]  So that's three strikes on day one.
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:59.920]  I mean, it's a celebration shenanigans happen.
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:02.840]  There was a truck driving up and down the street,
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:05.000]  not at all affiliated with the dispensary
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.240]  we were waiting in line at on January 1st
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:08.400]  that was giving out plants, right?
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:09.840]  It was the funniest shit ever.
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:13.080]  He drove by and threw out bags of edibles.
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:14.960]  He drove by and gave out plants.
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:15.800]  Yeah.
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:19.720]  I'm 90% sure it was somebody advertising for another shop
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:22.000]  that was not at all getting business.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.760]  But it might've just been one of us
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:25.640]  who had blown his stack with joy.
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:27.400]  It could have gone either way.
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:28.960]  I didn't get up close and investigate
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:32.080]  because I didn't want to lose my awesome spot in line.
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:35.080]  Because by then I was halfway through a two hour line.
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:39.960]  But there's some shenanigans to be expected.
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:42.720]  But it's day four or seven now or whatever,
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:45.640]  whenever this is gonna air, we've had a week now.
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:47.640]  Every ID gets checked.
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:49.040]  Every rule gets followed.
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:50.880]  If you've got a problem with the rule,
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:53.000]  get a lobbyist and get a lawyer.
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.040]  Change the rules at the state level
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:56.960]  so that they work better for everybody.
[02:26:56.960 --> 02:26:57.800]  You should already have a lawyer.
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:26:59.640]  Don't just fucking skirt it.
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:00.480]  Right?
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:01.720]  Different kind of lawyers.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.680]  But yeah, it's really important now
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:08.360]  that if you're in the legal industry
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:09.520]  that you step all the way up,
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:11.920]  we have to put our best foot forward right now.
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:13.200]  Every state, you guys.
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:16.240]  Every state and every upcoming state this applies to.
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:17.080]  Yep.
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:18.680]  If the medical shops in California
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:22.040]  had at all tried to put their best foot forward ever
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:24.040]  from 1996 till now,
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:26.680]  it would've been fucking legal a decade ago, bitches.
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:28.480]  But I mean, just like in Colorado,
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:30.960]  we had to deal with Dr. Reifer.
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:32.440]  The Boulder City Council right now
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:36.200]  is talking about dialing regulations back down to reality
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:37.560]  because we've gotten rid of,
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:40.360]  and I fucking quote, the Dr. Reifers of this world.
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:42.040]  Like, they're done now.
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:43.200]  They're all out of business
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:45.360]  talking about how they used to own a dispensary.
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:46.640]  You don't even know that one of my buddies
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:49.560]  owned a shop called Dr. Reifer in Colorado Springs, do you?
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:50.520]  Nope.
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:52.560]  Remember the kid that used to sell us the Hindu Kush?
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:53.600]  Vaguely.
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:54.520]  Dr. Reifer.
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:59.480]  The Dr. Reifer in question is the one up in Boulder.
[02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:01.400]  He had a twirling sign guy,
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:03.960]  and that's what everyone in Boulder was fired up about
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:06.400]  is his wildly inappropriate twirling sign dude.
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:08.440]  Yeah, we can't have twirling sign guys in Colorado.
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:10.760]  They're specifically banned because of this fuck.
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:13.600]  You can twirling sign for your tax return place.
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:16.200]  You can twirling sign for cheeseburgers.
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:18.440]  You can twirling sign for El Pollo Loco,
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:19.320]  but not for cannabis.
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:20.880]  You can't, for your vape shop.
[02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:23.320]  For your vape shop, yep, yep, yep.
[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:24.560]  All right, we're way off topic here.
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:26.720]  I'm gonna get, this article has more words written in it,
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:28.040]  and they say, he said,
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:30.840]  customers told them they've been waiting all their lives
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:32.040]  for a moment like this.
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:35.200]  They expected to sell $60,000 worth of marijuana
[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:36.440]  throughout the day.
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:38.480]  There were no reports of arrests or other problems
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:40.400]  involving the early sales in the state.
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:43.080]  Most stores planned to open later in the day.
[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:45.400]  Oregon is one of four states that have legalized
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:47.480]  the sale of recreational marijuana.
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:49.880]  Business began in Oregon with far more dispensaries
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:52.040]  than did Colorado or Washington State,
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:53.640]  where pot shops have been up and running
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:55.120]  for more than a year.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:58.120]  Alaska could begin retail sales next year.
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:00.200]  Big shout out to Charlo Green.
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:01.480]  Foster Buds PDX.
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:02.680]  She might be going to jail.
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:03.880]  You been following that story?
[02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:05.800]  No, she has not, or I have not.
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:07.520]  Her outfit keeps getting raided,
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:10.760]  because as you said, shops not till whenever,
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:13.000]  and they're trying to do like a distribution club
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:13.840]  of some kind.
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:15.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:16.800]  Charlo, take care of yourself, beautiful.
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:17.640]  Don't end up in jail.
[02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:20.400]  We need you out there fighting the good fight for us.
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:21.240]  Where am I?
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:24.200]  Foster Buds PDX in Portland
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:26.080]  had a couple hundred customers since opening
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:29.200]  just after midnight, shop manager Ken Martin said.
[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:31.080]  It's just been a steady flow, he said,
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:34.360]  adding that employees repeatedly refill jars with pot
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:35.800]  to meet the demand.
[02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:36.640]  Two customers came in.
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:38.200]  You'll get used to that shit, people.
[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:39.840]  Oh yeah, just keep filling those jars.
[02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:40.680]  You'll get used to that.
[02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:41.520]  It never stops.
[02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:42.900]  Writing down how much came out of the bag,
[02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:44.960]  which bag number, which jar it went into.
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:45.800]  Yep, keep going.
[02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:47.560]  I've watched it a billion times.
[02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:50.640]  Two customers who came in had just turned 21, he said.
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:53.120]  Davia Fleming, I don't know if I read your name right.
[02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:55.680]  Davia Fleming of Portland,
[02:29:55.680 --> 02:29:57.880]  the first buyer in McKee's store said the atmosphere
[02:29:57.880 --> 02:30:00.320]  was upbeat for the launch of the new industry.
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:02.520]  It's the end of prohibition, said Fleming,
[02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:05.300]  who uses the drug for medicinal purposes.
[02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:08.000]  You guys, have I ever mentioned that I was the first person
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.600]  to buy recreational cannabis at the Greener Side Dispensary
[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:11.760]  in Pueblo, Colorado?
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:14.080]  Woo-hoo, I was first, bitches.
[02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:15.640]  Anyway, I'm pretty sure I talked about that.
[02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:18.280]  That was like way long time ago.
[02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:20.280]  The store offered its first 25 customers
[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:23.400]  35 to 40% discounts and was handing out soda,
[02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:26.480]  coffee, juice, and other refreshments, McKee said.
[02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:28.700]  Many stores in Oregon were trying to lure customers
[02:30:28.700 --> 02:30:33.240]  with extended hours, food giveaways, and discounted marijuana.
[02:30:33.240 --> 02:30:35.980]  Shoppers who have, shoppers have one more incentive
[02:30:35.980 --> 02:30:37.580]  to buy early and often.
[02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:41.600]  Under Oregon law, purchases will be tax-free until January,
[02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:44.360]  a savings of up to 20%.
[02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:45.200]  That's a good way to do it.
[02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:46.980]  Get people to come in and see how it goes
[02:30:46.980 --> 02:30:48.320]  and then start charging tax.
[02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:49.200]  That's pretty nice.
[02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:51.600]  The one thing I really like about Oregon's law
[02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:53.680]  is they're really looking to kick the black market
[02:30:53.680 --> 02:30:54.520]  in the balls.
[02:30:54.520 --> 02:30:55.360]  Nice.
[02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:56.960]  So no taxes for the first little bit.
[02:30:56.960 --> 02:31:00.440]  So, you know, it's the old street theory
[02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:03.240]  that they threw at us in middle school in there.
[02:31:03.240 --> 02:31:05.160]  You get a taste of cheap.
[02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:06.280]  Yep, you want a free joint?
[02:31:06.280 --> 02:31:07.680]  Welcome to the selection.
[02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:09.200]  Welcome to the quality control.
[02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:11.200]  Welcome to the quality increases.
[02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:12.840]  Welcome to the guy being here on time.
[02:31:12.840 --> 02:31:15.360]  We'll hit you in the nuts with the taxes, Mignana.
[02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:16.520]  Yep, yep, yep.
[02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:17.360]  Getting to get hooked.
[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:19.440]  Or watching how it's made for two hours
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:21.040]  so that it doesn't look like foot traffic.
[02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:21.880]  None of that.
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:23.280]  Just walk in, have your mind blown
[02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:25.160]  with awesome weed product and then bounce.
[02:31:25.160 --> 02:31:26.000]  Right.
[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:26.840]  All right.
[02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:27.660]  The article goes on to say,
[02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:29.040]  store owners say they're hopeful
[02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:30.920]  they can avoid the shortages and price spikes
[02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:32.920]  that followed the start of legal sales last year
[02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:34.480]  in Washington and Colorado.
[02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:37.120]  Alaska could begin retail sales next year.
[02:31:37.120 --> 02:31:39.080]  I think I already read that, huh?
[02:31:39.080 --> 02:31:41.040]  One store offered a goodie bag with t-shirts,
[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:42.600]  but no free marijuana.
[02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:43.940]  That just sounds like the spot.
[02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:47.040]  Another will have a live band and 10% discounts.
[02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:49.640]  Several stores have erected billboards in Portland.
[02:31:49.640 --> 02:31:52.280]  A shop in Merlin is advertising on the radio.
[02:31:52.280 --> 02:31:53.760]  I'm just trying to basically stock up
[02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:55.000]  for maybe four or five times
[02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.040]  what the normal volume would be, said Chris Byers,
[02:31:57.040 --> 02:31:59.720]  owner of River City Dispensary in Merlin.
[02:31:59.720 --> 02:32:02.000]  Customers can buy as much as seven grams at a time
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.120]  of dried marijuana flower and leaf,
[02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:07.860]  the part that's generally smoked, plus plants and seeds.
[02:32:09.160 --> 02:32:10.760]  Dried flower and leaf.
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:12.760]  Hopefully there's not a lot of leaf in there.
[02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:14.860]  Yeah, basically buds is what they mean.
[02:32:14.860 --> 02:32:17.540]  Yeah, some of the people that write weed articles
[02:32:17.540 --> 02:32:19.800]  need to hang out with some weed heads.
[02:32:20.940 --> 02:32:23.340]  For the next year or so, pot-infused candy,
[02:32:23.340 --> 02:32:25.620]  cookies, oils, and lotions will be available
[02:32:25.620 --> 02:32:27.660]  only to people with medical marijuana cards
[02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:31.220]  as the state works on retail regulations for those products.
[02:32:31.220 --> 02:32:33.500]  Oregon has a robust supply system
[02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:35.700]  that has supported medical marijuana users
[02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:37.180]  and the black market.
[02:32:37.180 --> 02:32:39.740]  Companies have invested in massive warehouses in Portland
[02:32:39.740 --> 02:32:41.240]  to grow the drug indoors,
[02:32:41.240 --> 02:32:44.640]  and Southern Oregon has some of the nation's best conditions
[02:32:45.420 --> 02:32:46.960]  for outdoor cultivation.
[02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:48.880]  Growers don't face strict regulations yet,
[02:32:48.880 --> 02:32:51.440]  so the supply can more easily flow into retail stores
[02:32:51.440 --> 02:32:53.620]  than it did in Washington and Colorado.
[02:32:53.620 --> 02:32:55.060]  Still, there is concern.
[02:32:55.060 --> 02:32:56.660]  Summer has historically been a time
[02:32:56.660 --> 02:32:58.420]  of marijuana shortages in Oregon,
[02:32:58.420 --> 02:33:01.320]  and most of the outdoor crop that is ready to harvest,
[02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:03.440]  and most of the outdoor crop is not ready to harvest.
[02:33:03.440 --> 02:33:04.740]  Sorry, I skipped a word there.
[02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:07.520]  Indoor growers have had minimal time to ramp up production
[02:33:07.520 --> 02:33:08.900]  because lawmakers only approved
[02:33:08.900 --> 02:33:11.600]  the October 1st start date three months ago.
[02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:13.920]  Now they had time to get one quick crop in.
[02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:16.320]  We have kind of a seasonal growing market here in Oregon.
[02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:18.080]  Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:19.400]  Said Jeremy Pratt.
[02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:22.080]  He said, we kind of have a seasonal growing market
[02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:24.580]  here in Oregon, said the owner of Nectar Cannabis,
[02:33:24.580 --> 02:33:26.200]  which has four stores in Portland.
[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:28.060]  We have lots of products in the fall,
[02:33:28.060 --> 02:33:30.840]  and then it kind of gets tight this time of year anyway.
[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:33.360]  Green Oasis, which has two locations in Portland
[02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:34.840]  and more on the way,
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:36.840]  has prepared by trying to cultivate
[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:38.880]  strong relationships with growers.
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:40.760]  It will entice customers Thursday evening
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:43.680]  with an outdoor band and offer 10% discounts
[02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:45.440]  to those who spend at least $40,
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:47.600]  co-owner Matthew Schwimmer said.
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:49.740]  We don't know of anyone else doing a band,
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:51.280]  and we thought it was a good idea
[02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:54.640]  to give back to the community, Schwimmer said.
[02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:55.680]  So that's the article, you guys.
[02:33:55.680 --> 02:33:57.880]  Big congratulations to the state of Oregon.
[02:33:57.880 --> 02:34:00.160]  They have now got recreational cannabis sales.
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:02.440]  It is tax-free until January.
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:03.920]  So if you're doing the circuit,
[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:05.780]  make sure you go stop in Oregon.
[02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:07.360]  Make sure you get yourself,
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:09.320]  is that where the fucking donut shop is
[02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:10.520]  that everybody talks about?
[02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:11.840]  That's where those donuts are.
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:13.680]  Go get some tasty donuts,
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:16.800]  and then go get yourself some recreational cannabis.
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:17.640]  Shout out to donuts.
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:19.400]  I've been eating too many donuts lately.
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:20.560]  A shout out to donuts.
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:22.080]  Go get yourself some recreational cannabis
[02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:23.680]  in the state of Oregon, you guys.
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:26.040]  Yeah, make sure you're 21,
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:27.320]  and make sure they check your ID.
[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:28.320]  And if they don't check your ID,
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:29.160]  call them out on it,
[02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:30.360]  tell them that they're not following the rules.
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:32.400]  They're gonna fuck it up for the future.
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:33.240]  Yep.
[02:34:34.100 --> 02:34:35.040]  If you listen to the show
[02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:37.920]  and you haven't had a chance to legally purchase cannabis,
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:39.680]  start saving for a plane ticket.
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:41.320]  If you're 21.
[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:42.280]  If you're 21.
[02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:43.120]  If you're 21.
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:46.520]  It'll just change your world.
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:50.600]  When I think of what I used to deal with to buy weed,
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:52.360]  like what was just standard
[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:55.620]  when I was in high school and in college,
[02:34:55.620 --> 02:34:57.800]  and then in my 20s,
[02:34:57.800 --> 02:34:59.400]  it was just a nightmare,
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:00.680]  especially in retrospect.
[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:02.920]  Like it was just life when it was happening.
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:04.040]  It wasn't that bad.
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:06.640]  Like I didn't mind watching how it's made that much.
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:10.880]  But now that it's totally legal,
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:12.240]  and I work in a pot shop
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:13.800]  and it's just like picking up a cheeseburger
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:15.520]  on the way home,
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:17.400]  it's so much better.
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:18.920]  Yeah.
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:20.960]  I was afraid of it at first.
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:22.120]  It's so much better.
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:24.280]  I can't adequately put it into words.
[02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:26.120]  Well, I came from the black market
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:28.400]  and I was afraid of all of this.
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:31.000]  And it's, I don't know,
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.480]  freaky to a lot of people.
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:34.680]  It's a huge change.
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:36.680]  If you live in a non-legal state,
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:38.840]  you worry about when you,
[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:39.840]  I don't know how much weed you buy,
[02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:41.480]  but when half of it is gone,
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:42.360]  you start thinking about,
[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:44.240]  fuck, where am I going to get more weed?
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:45.920]  There's no reliable spot.
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:47.080]  I never have to think,
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:49.200]  where am I going to get my next bag of weed?
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:52.480]  Because if I don't grow it,
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:55.000]  I can go to the shop at which I work,
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.760]  or I can drive to one of my other buddy's shops,
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:00.200]  or I can drive to one of my other friend's shops,
[02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:02.040]  or I'm also a medical marijuana patient.
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:04.560]  So I could drive to a medical dispensary.
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:05.760]  Excuse me, I'm trying to burp.
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:07.960]  I could drive to a medical marijuana shop
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:10.440]  and get whatever cannabis I need in there.
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:11.800]  So it is a little bit better that way.
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:14.520]  It made her more available, way more available.
[02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:16.600]  It made weed more advanced.
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:18.960]  The innovations that have come with this legalization
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:21.040]  have been incredible.
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:23.280]  So I like it.
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:24.480]  I think it's way better.
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:25.320]  But I was, I feared this.
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:26.680]  It's so much better.
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:28.120]  Legalization is beautiful.
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:29.920]  We can do so many things.
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:32.280]  Like it's not so,
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:35.960]  like I never had trouble finding pot before in my life.
[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:36.960]  It never came up.
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:42.040]  I might have trouble locating good pot or the same pot.
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:44.880]  And it was always horseshit, whatever you bought.
[02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:47.200]  Like it was never what they said it was.
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:49.640]  It was just, you'd ask, do you have any of this?
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:50.560]  And they'd go, oh yeah.
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:52.440]  And they'd go get a handful of something different
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:54.280]  and be like, this is the name you said.
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:55.520]  Yep, yep.
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:56.840]  And you just believed it.
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:59.080]  That was the best you had.
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:01.320]  Hopefully you weren't getting cheated.
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:03.360]  And that was just life.
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:08.120]  Now, there's 10 stores within a 15 minute drive
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:09.720]  from both our homes.
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:13.040]  And that's pretty much true across Colorado at this point.
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:14.480]  And you can go to two or three of them
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:16.240]  and see what you do and don't like.
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:18.200]  Every shop's got different pricing.
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:21.080]  Every shop's got a different selection.
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:23.200]  There are major companies across Colorado
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:26.520]  where you can kind of find their stuff everywhere.
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:27.840]  Sort of like Coke and Pepsi.
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:29.680]  Like you don't have to go to a Coca-Cola store.
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:30.520]  Yeah, Chibu Chu's for example.
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:32.160]  Chibu Chu's, Incredibles.
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:33.360]  They're in almost every shop.
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:37.720]  Edapure, like there's a handful of major edible companies
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:39.360]  that are everywhere now.
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:41.840]  I feel bad for the delivery people.
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:43.280]  That's a lot of paperwork.
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:46.880]  Dixie, like there's a bunch of them.
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:49.200]  And it's just beautiful.
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:51.600]  You walk in and there's 30, 40,
[02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:53.120]  I mean, sometimes only five or six,
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:54.560]  but there's a selection of buds.
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:56.480]  You get to look at them, smell them.
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:57.840]  You get to know the price.
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:00.400]  Like, it's not weird that you drove to someone's house
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:01.800]  and spent 20 minutes in their living room
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:03.280]  and you don't want to buy this.
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:04.560]  You can just, thanks and leave.
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:06.320]  Yeah, if you go to a dispensary
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:07.760]  and you don't like what's in there, you can leave.
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:09.480]  You don't have to buy anything there.
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:11.680]  Yeah, people ask me what the minimum purchase is
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:12.520]  and it's like nothing.
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:14.800]  If you don't want any of this,
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:16.680]  please, you don't have to buy.
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:18.120]  Like I'll show you around everything
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:19.800]  and you can leave knowing what's going on.
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:20.760]  But yeah.
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:22.240]  And then go look at a few other places.
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:23.920]  You can buy nothing.
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:25.080]  Like half the time when you do that,
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:27.720]  I give you a coupon book with everybody in the town listed.
[02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:28.560]  There you go.
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:30.040]  Like just give you something to do for the day.
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:31.880]  So guys, don't feel obligated to buy something
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:34.320]  if you're in a dispensary and you don't like what you see.
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:35.680]  Don't ever, that's your money.
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:36.520]  You work for that.
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:37.480]  You're not wasting their time.
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:38.320]  That's a store.
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:40.360]  You can go in there and do what you need to do.
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:41.640]  If you're a marijuana fan,
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:43.800]  you're going to like what you see.
[02:38:43.800 --> 02:38:45.400]  In almost any shop you go to,
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:47.840]  especially if it's the first shop you go to.
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:51.560]  I went, I was in Colorado Springs hiking one day
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:52.440]  and I had a friend with me.
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:53.360]  I had hash with me.
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:54.360]  I just travel with dabs.
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:56.520]  I don't usually take flowers with me.
[02:38:56.520 --> 02:38:59.300]  We call the, you guys that aren't Colorado connoisseurs,
[02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:02.220]  we call the buds, we just call it flowers.
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:03.780]  I didn't have any flowers with me
[02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:05.900]  and somebody wanted to smoke some weed.
[02:39:05.900 --> 02:39:08.660]  And so we're driving and I was like, look, a dispensary.
[02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:09.500]  And we pull up, dude,
[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:12.580]  I would not smoke anything in that fucking place.
[02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:14.620]  You could not have paid me to smoke anything in there.
[02:39:14.620 --> 02:39:15.460]  I fucking left.
[02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:16.820]  I was like, nope, no thanks.
[02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:18.340]  I'm like, what's wrong?
[02:39:18.340 --> 02:39:20.820]  And I was like, it all smells exactly the same.
[02:39:20.820 --> 02:39:23.500]  Like there's no difference on any of these strains.
[02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:25.140]  Like it was, yeah, I just left.
[02:39:25.140 --> 02:39:26.420]  I didn't need anything out of there.
[02:39:26.420 --> 02:39:28.980]  I've left many a shop.
[02:39:28.980 --> 02:39:31.620]  Just some of them aren't up to par.
[02:39:31.620 --> 02:39:34.700]  Some of them only still exist
[02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:37.140]  because enough of the population
[02:39:37.140 --> 02:39:40.860]  legitimately had to stop smoking weed 30 years ago
[02:39:40.860 --> 02:39:43.140]  because it was too risky for them.
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:44.960]  And only now that they're retiring
[02:39:44.960 --> 02:39:46.700]  and that their kids are grown,
[02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:49.040]  are they getting out and trying to buy weed again?
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:51.780]  I mean, for 30 years, they didn't know who to call.
[02:39:51.780 --> 02:39:53.900]  And we're too worried about asking their friends
[02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:56.020]  and neighbors about losing their jobs
[02:39:56.620 --> 02:39:58.460]  or custody of their kids or whatever.
[02:39:58.460 --> 02:39:59.980]  They just didn't.
[02:39:59.980 --> 02:40:02.060]  Now they can just pull up to a shop, walk in,
[02:40:02.060 --> 02:40:03.460]  ask for an aid.
[02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:05.380]  A ton of the people I talk to every day
[02:40:05.380 --> 02:40:07.700]  have super silver hair and huge smiles.
[02:40:07.700 --> 02:40:08.540]  It's fun.
[02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:10.540]  I've been working outside of the shop lately.
[02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:12.260]  My job that I've been doing is just required
[02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:14.220]  some cleaning of some shit that's taken about a week.
[02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:16.620]  And I've been out in the back with the door open
[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:17.940]  and I see a lot of people walk by
[02:40:17.940 --> 02:40:19.220]  because there's a parking area over there
[02:40:19.220 --> 02:40:20.420]  and they walk by me.
[02:40:20.420 --> 02:40:23.460]  Most of the people that I see are older folks.
[02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:25.900]  It's not a lot of young punks buying weed.
[02:40:26.740 --> 02:40:28.140]  It's older folks that used to smoke back in the day,
[02:40:28.140 --> 02:40:32.020]  like you're saying, that have kids that are in college now.
[02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:33.300]  It's like, yeah, you see them come in,
[02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:37.660]  you see a 20-something college kid come in with his mom
[02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:39.660]  or his dad and they go buy weed together.
[02:40:39.660 --> 02:40:41.540]  And I think it's really funny to see that shit.
[02:40:41.540 --> 02:40:44.540]  Most of the 21, 22-year-old people I see
[02:40:44.540 --> 02:40:45.980]  are on family vacation.
[02:40:45.980 --> 02:40:47.180]  That's awesome.
[02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:48.460]  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:51.540]  We get a lot of younger people too,
[02:40:51.580 --> 02:40:56.580]  but definitely the tourist economy is retirees.
[02:40:56.620 --> 02:40:57.740]  If you think about it, it makes sense.
[02:40:57.740 --> 02:41:00.220]  If you're 22, there's no reason to fly to Colorado
[02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:03.020]  to buy weed except for the enjoyment
[02:41:03.020 --> 02:41:04.780]  of buying legal cannabis and getting to see
[02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:07.420]  what the selection and the hype's all about.
[02:41:07.420 --> 02:41:08.860]  Because you know 30 people that's,
[02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:11.500]  we're happy to sell you a bag of weed
[02:41:11.500 --> 02:41:13.300]  or at least one or two.
[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:15.840]  There's no reason to come here and spend the money
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:18.380]  on the flight for what you can do at home already.
[02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:22.260]  But if you're 65, there's still a lot of risk in Oklahoma.
[02:41:22.260 --> 02:41:23.100]  Shit, yeah.
[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:24.120]  And there's none here.
[02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:25.780]  And it just blows people away.
[02:41:25.780 --> 02:41:28.740]  I hear that at least twice, three times a week.
[02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:31.900]  No, where I'm from, this is really frowned upon.
[02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:33.520]  We would get in so much trouble for this.
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:35.120]  Everyone would think bad about us
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:37.660]  if they knew that we were here doing this.
[02:41:37.660 --> 02:41:39.540]  Like, please don't tell my friends and family.
[02:41:39.540 --> 02:41:41.260]  And it's like, lady, you're from Georgia.
[02:41:41.260 --> 02:41:42.900]  But I don't know none of your people.
[02:41:42.900 --> 02:41:44.140]  I don't know none of your people.
[02:41:44.140 --> 02:41:45.860]  I'm not gonna call your congregation
[02:41:45.860 --> 02:41:48.020]  and be like, watch the security footage.
[02:41:48.660 --> 02:41:50.140]  She bought a chocolate bar with weed in it.
[02:41:50.140 --> 02:41:51.820]  You guys, if you come here and you get some weed,
[02:41:51.820 --> 02:41:52.980]  don't try to take it home.
[02:41:52.980 --> 02:41:53.940]  Smoke it all here.
[02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:54.780]  Smoke it all here.
[02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:57.020]  If you can't finish it, call me.
[02:41:57.020 --> 02:41:58.220]  You can drop it off at my spot.
[02:41:58.220 --> 02:42:00.060]  There are a lot of locals that are happy
[02:42:00.060 --> 02:42:02.740]  to help you finish the bag you overpurchased.
[02:42:02.740 --> 02:42:05.060]  It is legal to give your weed away
[02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:06.620]  to somebody who is over 21.
[02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:08.620]  If you've got cannabis and you bought it in Colorado
[02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:09.660]  and you're about to get on the flight
[02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:10.600]  and you're about to fly home
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:12.700]  or you're about to drive back across the border,
[02:42:12.700 --> 02:42:14.860]  stop at the last gas station in Colorado
[02:42:14.860 --> 02:42:16.100]  before you hit the border
[02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:17.420]  or fucking while you're at the airport,
[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:18.740]  and you see some dude with some dreadlocks
[02:42:18.740 --> 02:42:19.580]  and you just got off the plane.
[02:42:19.580 --> 02:42:21.820]  Try not to give it to someone who's at work.
[02:42:21.820 --> 02:42:22.700]  That's a good idea.
[02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:24.380]  Don't, well, unless it's me,
[02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:25.620]  because I can take weed, I can't.
[02:42:25.620 --> 02:42:26.460]  I actually can't.
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:28.740]  If they have dreadlocks, that last statement doesn't apply.
[02:42:28.740 --> 02:42:31.260]  Right, yeah, if you're walking through the airport
[02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:32.300]  and you got extra weed on you
[02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:33.500]  and you see somebody with dreadlocks,
[02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:35.500]  they just flew in, they need some weed,
[02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:36.740]  just hand them your bag.
[02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:37.580]  Just pay it forward.
[02:42:37.580 --> 02:42:38.740]  Maybe I should rephrase that.
[02:42:38.740 --> 02:42:40.780]  Okay, so the guy that works at McDonald's
[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:43.500]  really wants your unfinished bag of weed.
[02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:45.500]  He could really use that kind of charity
[02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:48.020]  and sort of pat on the back,
[02:42:48.020 --> 02:42:50.220]  but if you give it to him at the drive-through window,
[02:42:50.220 --> 02:42:51.860]  he's gonna get fired.
[02:42:51.860 --> 02:42:53.740]  You were trying to do something nice.
[02:42:53.740 --> 02:42:56.660]  So have him meet you outside real quick.
[02:42:56.660 --> 02:42:59.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:59.740 --> 02:43:00.820]  Catch him in the parking lot.
[02:43:00.820 --> 02:43:02.460]  We've gotten way off topic.
[02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:03.500]  We've gone for a long time.
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:05.340]  Let's wrap up this show.
[02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:06.780]  Hey, Mike, thanks for coming over, dude.
[02:43:06.780 --> 02:43:07.620]  Happy to.
[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:09.100]  You look like you're beat by now.
[02:43:09.100 --> 02:43:11.140]  I am, I'm ready to go home, grub something,
[02:43:11.140 --> 02:43:12.780]  take another dab and pass out.
[02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:14.260]  All right, well, then I'm gonna let you do that.
[02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:16.020]  You guys, I wanna thank you for listening to the show.
[02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:17.180]  I wanna thank each and every one of you
[02:43:17.180 --> 02:43:19.060]  for tuning into the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:43:19.060 --> 02:43:23.180]  Episode number 100 is on its way.
[02:43:23.180 --> 02:43:24.300]  I'm not sure what we're gonna do yet.
[02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:25.660]  I think we're just gonna party.
[02:43:25.660 --> 02:43:27.740]  I'm gonna try to get a bunch of people on the show.
[02:43:27.740 --> 02:43:30.340]  I might take a bunch of big, fat, ridiculous dabs.
[02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:32.540]  Big old round table with a bunch of coughing.
[02:43:32.540 --> 02:43:33.620]  Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[02:43:33.620 --> 02:43:35.340]  A square table with a bunch of coughing.
[02:43:35.340 --> 02:43:36.180]  I like it.
[02:43:36.180 --> 02:43:37.020]  I like it.
[02:43:37.020 --> 02:43:38.820]  All right, you guys, I would appreciate it
[02:43:38.820 --> 02:43:40.980]  if you'd support us on all the social media stuff.

[02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:51.860]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[02:43:51.860 --> 02:43:54.220]  On Instagram, you guys, I use iRegenetics.
[02:43:54.220 --> 02:43:56.660]  That's my seed company, iRegenetics.

[02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:03.860]  I'd love to have you as one of my followers.
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:05.620]  I've been posting a lot of cool stuff.
[02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:07.660]  Been posting pictures of a commercial grow
[02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:10.900]  that is pretty damn impressive.
[02:44:11.820 --> 02:44:13.020]  I think the pictures are just gonna get better and better
[02:44:13.020 --> 02:44:14.140]  over the rest of the year.
[02:44:14.140 --> 02:44:16.180]  As time goes, I'm just taking my iPhone,
[02:44:16.180 --> 02:44:17.380]  using the iPhone.
[02:44:17.380 --> 02:44:18.940]  I haven't taken the good camera to work it
[02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:21.260]  and taken any pictures, so when I do that,
[02:44:21.260 --> 02:44:22.980]  people will shit their pants.
[02:44:22.980 --> 02:44:23.820]  Yeah.
[02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:25.060]  All right, let's see.
[02:44:25.060 --> 02:44:27.980]  I'll be back on Monday with another episode.
[02:44:27.980 --> 02:44:30.140]  Gosh, I just realized how close number 100 is.
[02:44:30.140 --> 02:44:33.340]  Next is 99, and then after that is number 100.
[02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:35.260]  We're gonna have to have a party.
[02:44:35.260 --> 02:44:36.140]  Yep.
[02:44:36.140 --> 02:44:37.780]  Yep, Mike, you sound like your beat, bro.
[02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:39.540]  Let's wrap this shit up.
[02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:42.060]  You guys, I don't think I have a lot else to say.

[02:45:30.980 --> 02:45:32.020]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:33.820]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[02:45:33.820 --> 02:45:35.420]  and give your mama a hug for me.
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:53.080]  To you, cause you treat me right.
[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:55.920]  I put my trust in the world, and the world gets tight.
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:45:58.800]  Shift my trust to you, it's like a crystal clear night.
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:01.560]  Expand in all directions, bless them sections to unite.
[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:04.440]  Hashems raised by your blaze, like my way, light up my life.
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:09.540]  And it is raised like skyscrapers in the night.
[02:46:09.540 --> 02:47:19.640]  I see it, I know it's here.
[02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:22.400]  You can see, beauty shines externally.
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:52.640]  That's the story of Greece, but inside, America bleeds.
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:48:04.970]  You're my amen, the angels fall in love with the glory.
[02:48:04.970 --> 02:48:06.890]  Hashem, Hashem, Hashem.
[02:48:27.300 --> 02:48:29.860]  Yes, it's who my brain grooves, open up the grooves.
[02:48:29.860 --> 02:48:34.840]  With vanilla secrets, start to ooze.
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:36.360]  Don't snooze, it's pure light.
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:49:22.120]  The most high wants us alive, what's the proof?
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:25.600]  Sheh banei besamik, taz p'mera ve-yamein.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:33.350]  V'sein elkeinu v'soyda sa.
[02:49:33.350 --> 02:49:36.950]  Sheh banei besamik, taz p'mera ve-yamein.
[02:49:51.410 --> 02:49:53.490]  Truth illuminates from inside.
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:32.040]  When you're searching strange places, times unravel.
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:35.280]  Like twine, travel and you lose the battle and get left behind.
[02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:36.800]  When you swerve, you're left midswriving.
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:38.720]  Four fifths got left behind.
[02:50:38.720 --> 02:51:26.390]  Your boy, your, your, your.
[02:51:26.390 --> 02:51:28.190]  All right, podcast world, I want to thank you guys again
