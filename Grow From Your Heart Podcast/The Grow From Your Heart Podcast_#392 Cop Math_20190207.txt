[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[00:02.320 --> 00:06.040]  It is time for episode 392 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.040 --> 00:08.680]  Sitting across the table from me is a fan favorite.
[00:08.680 --> 00:10.080]  I'd like to welcome to the show, White Mike.
[00:10.080 --> 00:10.960]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:10.960 --> 00:11.800]  Thanks, man.
[00:11.800 --> 00:12.640]  What's up, everybody?
[00:12.640 --> 00:13.920]  Thanks for coming and hanging out, dude.
[00:13.920 --> 00:14.760]  Yeah, man.
[00:14.760 --> 00:16.120]  Good conversation already tonight.
[00:16.120 --> 00:18.000]  We've been here for a little while smoking some dabs,
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.160]  having conversations.
[00:19.160 --> 00:21.400]  We needed to turn on these mics probably 30 minutes ago.
[00:21.400 --> 00:23.920]  Right, there's a bunch of little fun stories
[00:23.920 --> 00:24.880]  that y'all missed.
[00:24.880 --> 00:25.720]  I think it's time.
[00:25.720 --> 00:27.640]  Got us both in a good podcasting mood,
[00:27.640 --> 00:29.040]  so get ready for some rambles, y'all.
[00:29.040 --> 00:30.880]  Speaking of getting in a good podcast mood,
[00:30.880 --> 00:33.040]  it is kind of tradition that we start the podcast off
[00:33.040 --> 00:35.400]  by talking about what we are dabbing.
[00:35.400 --> 00:38.400]  The table looks like a small buffet of concentrates.
[00:38.400 --> 00:40.880]  I think we mainly focused on the fluffernutter
[00:40.880 --> 00:41.720]  from Contraband.
[00:41.720 --> 00:43.040]  It smells amazing.
[00:43.040 --> 00:45.200]  It's got kind of a sweet, sharp sort of a smell
[00:45.200 --> 00:46.120]  that I really enjoy.
[00:46.120 --> 00:47.760]  I knew Mike was a fan of that.
[00:47.760 --> 00:49.240]  We took some dabs of that.
[00:49.240 --> 00:50.640]  We also may have hit,
[00:50.640 --> 00:52.160]  what did we hit before we went outside?
[00:52.160 --> 00:53.760]  Oh, the mandarin cookies.
[00:53.760 --> 00:54.920]  Had some mandarin cookies,
[00:54.920 --> 00:57.280]  which had a really an amazing flavor.
[00:57.280 --> 00:58.680]  Really pretty product, too.
[00:59.320 --> 01:00.840]  It's almost clear.
[01:00.840 --> 01:02.760]  It's a clear yellowish color.
[01:02.760 --> 01:03.720]  I really like that one.
[01:03.720 --> 01:06.400]  So we've had a little buffet of concentrates.
[01:06.400 --> 01:07.520]  We are well-medicated.
[01:07.520 --> 01:08.720]  We're nice and chatty.
[01:08.720 --> 01:10.480]  So you guys, welcome to the show.
[01:10.480 --> 01:11.920]  Welcome, everybody.
[01:11.920 --> 01:13.400]  As always, this podcast is brought to you
[01:13.400 --> 01:15.400]  by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[01:15.400 --> 01:17.600]  It's time for fresh genetics.
[01:17.600 --> 01:19.520]  I might edit that, or I probably won't.
[01:19.520 --> 01:21.720]  It's time for fresh genetics in your garden.
[01:21.720 --> 01:23.120]  That's right, quit growing that old crap
[01:23.120 --> 01:24.320]  that you've been growing forever.
[01:24.320 --> 01:27.080]  Get some new seeds and get them from Oregon Elite Seeds.
[01:27.120 --> 01:30.280]  You can find them at oregoneliteseeds.com.
[01:30.280 --> 01:32.960]  Big shout out to all my friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[01:35.040 --> 01:37.120]  Mike's looking at me like he's got more ads to do.
[01:37.120 --> 01:38.360]  One more thing, I just wanted to make
[01:38.360 --> 01:39.320]  a really cool announcement.
[01:39.320 --> 01:40.280]  It's not even an ad.
[01:40.280 --> 01:42.160]  Just one more thing I want to mention.
[01:42.160 --> 01:45.120]  iReed Genetics will be at the Dude Grows Cup.
[01:45.120 --> 01:46.520]  That's right, the Dude Grows Cup.
[01:46.520 --> 01:47.760]  What up, DGC?
[01:47.760 --> 01:48.600]  What's up, boys?
[01:48.600 --> 01:51.720]  April 13th at Cultivated Synergy in Denver.
[01:51.720 --> 01:52.560]  Join us.
[01:52.560 --> 01:53.880]  I don't want to start sounding like the dude.
[01:53.880 --> 01:55.360]  My voice almost went to,
[01:56.200 --> 01:57.040]  to the dude.
[01:57.040 --> 01:58.720]  That was kind of strange.
[01:58.720 --> 02:01.600]  But anyway, April 13th at Cultivated Synergy,
[02:01.600 --> 02:02.960]  the Dude Grows Cup.
[02:02.960 --> 02:03.960]  I will be there.
[02:03.960 --> 02:05.720]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[02:05.720 --> 02:06.560]  You can get your tickets.
[02:06.560 --> 02:09.560]  Go to the dudegrows.com website.
[02:09.560 --> 02:11.360]  I'm sure that all of the information you need
[02:11.360 --> 02:14.280]  to find us at the Dude Grows Cup will be right there.
[02:14.280 --> 02:16.320]  It is an invite only sort of thing,
[02:16.320 --> 02:18.560]  so you've got to go register with the event, right?
[02:18.560 --> 02:20.440]  I'm pretty sure you've got to be 21.
[02:20.440 --> 02:21.280]  Be 21.
[02:21.280 --> 02:22.400]  And not be a dick.
[02:22.400 --> 02:23.760]  Don't be a dick.
[02:23.960 --> 02:26.640]  If all that applies to you, come hang out.
[02:26.640 --> 02:27.480]  Have a good time with us.
[02:27.480 --> 02:29.840]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[02:29.840 --> 02:31.080]  All right.
[02:31.080 --> 02:32.680]  I've been doing that long series of Grow Lessons.
[02:32.680 --> 02:34.400]  This is not going to be a Grow Lesson, you guys.
[02:34.400 --> 02:35.640]  This is going to be a fun episode.
[02:35.640 --> 02:36.760]  We've got a really cool topic,
[02:36.760 --> 02:38.520]  but I want to talk about the Grow Series.
[02:38.520 --> 02:41.920]  I think I have one or two more podcasts to repost
[02:41.920 --> 02:43.840]  that are part of the Grow Lesson series.
[02:43.840 --> 02:45.040]  I know I'm reposting old stuff,
[02:45.040 --> 02:48.040]  but it falls in line perfectly with the Grow Lessons.
[02:48.040 --> 02:51.760]  I'm actually glad you didn't try to redo dry hearing.
[02:51.760 --> 02:52.880]  It was beautiful.
[02:53.200 --> 02:54.040]  I listened, I was like,
[02:54.040 --> 02:56.520]  that episode is so good.
[02:56.520 --> 02:57.360]  Well, thank you.
[02:57.360 --> 02:58.200]  I appreciate that.
[02:58.200 --> 03:00.240]  The original post is one of the most
[03:00.240 --> 03:03.120]  listened to podcast episodes I have ever made.
[03:03.120 --> 03:04.680]  So I just reposted it.
[03:04.680 --> 03:05.560]  Maybe that's cheating,
[03:05.560 --> 03:08.280]  but I'm doing this long series of Grow Lessons,
[03:08.280 --> 03:09.280]  and that's where we were.
[03:09.280 --> 03:10.280]  I was trying and caring.
[03:10.280 --> 03:11.240]  No reason to try again.
[03:11.240 --> 03:12.080]  Thank you.
[03:12.080 --> 03:13.800]  Thanks for the validation.
[03:13.800 --> 03:14.920]  So I've got two more episodes
[03:14.920 --> 03:16.640]  that I think will be reposted.
[03:16.640 --> 03:19.920]  Then after that, we will move into brand new content.
[03:19.920 --> 03:22.360]  I do have a lot of content lined up and planned for you guys.
[03:22.880 --> 03:24.120]  I've got stuff that I've been writing down,
[03:24.120 --> 03:25.080]  been kind of preloading.
[03:25.080 --> 03:26.520]  I've got stuff prerecorded.
[03:26.520 --> 03:27.680]  So then when it comes time,
[03:27.680 --> 03:28.640]  the Grow Lessons are done,
[03:28.640 --> 03:30.400]  we can get into fresh content.
[03:30.400 --> 03:33.800]  I know you guys have sent me a mountain of emails.
[03:33.800 --> 03:35.160]  I'm going to print them,
[03:35.160 --> 03:36.480]  and I'll read a few of them on the show.
[03:36.480 --> 03:38.200]  We'll start digging through the pile.
[03:38.200 --> 03:39.720]  If you've sent some emails and I haven't got to,
[03:39.720 --> 03:40.760]  just be patient,
[03:40.760 --> 03:42.320]  and hopefully I'll get to your email soon.
[03:42.320 --> 03:43.560]  I've got a lot of emails, Mike.
[03:43.560 --> 03:45.800]  Those Grow Lessons really held us back on emails.
[03:45.800 --> 03:47.840]  It's been an intense series of lessons,
[03:47.840 --> 03:50.160]  but it's such a good one.
[03:50.160 --> 03:51.600]  It was a lot of fun to do.
[03:51.640 --> 03:54.160]  I feel like I gave a lot of information.
[03:54.160 --> 03:56.600]  I got a lot of praise and a lot of emails
[03:56.600 --> 03:57.640]  through the Grow series.
[03:57.640 --> 03:59.280]  And it was time for an update.
[03:59.280 --> 04:01.400]  It had been 200 episodes
[04:01.400 --> 04:04.040]  since the last start to finish Grow Run.
[04:04.040 --> 04:05.640]  Since some of that stuff had even been said,
[04:05.640 --> 04:07.880]  and I've changed a lot of my ideals and approaches
[04:07.880 --> 04:09.200]  and opinions on things.
[04:09.200 --> 04:11.080]  Well, the science has changed.
[04:11.080 --> 04:13.960]  The equipment that's available has changed.
[04:13.960 --> 04:15.720]  Everything's taken 10 steps forward.
[04:15.720 --> 04:17.240]  Absolutely.
[04:17.240 --> 04:20.360]  I was saying how much I enjoy doing it at the same time.
[04:20.360 --> 04:21.280]  I'm so glad it's over.
[04:21.960 --> 04:25.440]  That was a lot of work for somebody with my sporadic ADD
[04:25.440 --> 04:27.400]  to stick to a topic for that long.
[04:27.400 --> 04:28.640]  And yes, there were interruptions.
[04:28.640 --> 04:31.560]  I didn't do solid Grow Lessons for 14 weeks.
[04:31.560 --> 04:32.400]  I did some interruptions.
[04:32.400 --> 04:34.440]  Yeah, well, Mike came and hung out.
[04:34.440 --> 04:35.840]  There were other things to talk about,
[04:35.840 --> 04:40.040]  but for my brain to try to focus for that long,
[04:40.040 --> 04:42.200]  that was a task for me.
[04:42.200 --> 04:43.600]  You guys, what I'm trying to say is
[04:43.600 --> 04:45.000]  I appreciate you for sticking through
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.400]  the long series of Grow Lessons.
[04:46.400 --> 04:48.080]  Thanks for listening to those that are not done.
[04:48.080 --> 04:49.840]  I think there are two more, like I said,
[04:49.880 --> 04:51.880]  then fresh content.
[04:51.880 --> 04:53.400]  Fresh content, that's right, fresh content.
[04:53.400 --> 04:54.240]  If I have sent you-
[04:54.240 --> 04:55.080]  Fresh is coming.
[04:55.080 --> 04:56.520]  Or if you've sent me an email,
[04:56.520 --> 04:59.200]  I will get that on the show in the near future.
[04:59.200 --> 05:00.320]  And thanks for all those emails, you guys,
[05:00.320 --> 05:01.960]  and thanks for being patient with me.
[05:01.960 --> 05:04.480]  Now, once again, also, Mike, thanks for coming,
[05:04.480 --> 05:05.640]  taking time away from the kids.
[05:05.640 --> 05:06.480]  Hell yeah.
[05:06.480 --> 05:09.160]  And I think it is time to get into the podcast.
[05:09.160 --> 05:10.400]  Are you ready, guys?
[05:12.440 --> 05:13.640]  That was really creepy.
[05:13.640 --> 05:14.480]  I think I'm supposed to be.
[05:14.480 --> 05:16.120]  That's even creepier.
[05:16.120 --> 05:17.800]  Stop, stop doing that.
[05:17.800 --> 05:18.640]  You're weird.
[05:18.640 --> 05:19.480]  I'm looking around my own place going.
[05:20.080 --> 05:21.640]  That last dab has me in a weird mood.
[05:21.640 --> 05:23.320]  Like I'm energized.
[05:23.320 --> 05:25.640]  Well, I noticed that the cigarette
[05:25.640 --> 05:26.880]  also does a little something to you.
[05:26.880 --> 05:29.560]  I don't smoke cigarettes, so we went outside and-
[05:29.560 --> 05:31.600]  There's a lot of terrible things about nicotine,
[05:31.600 --> 05:33.800]  but there's a reason people do it.
[05:33.800 --> 05:36.400]  It made you a little giddy, a little happier
[05:36.400 --> 05:38.560]  after that dab, and then the cigarette
[05:38.560 --> 05:40.040]  put you on another smiley plane,
[05:40.040 --> 05:42.160]  and then we, of course, dabbed again before we recorded.
[05:42.160 --> 05:44.280]  So you were well lit, and that cigarette helped.
[05:44.280 --> 05:46.080]  It does another extra thing.
[05:46.080 --> 05:47.040]  Getting out helps, too.
[05:47.040 --> 05:49.080]  I've been confined lately.
[05:49.480 --> 05:50.320]  Thanks for coming.
[05:50.320 --> 05:52.120]  You're always invited, bro, recording or not.
[05:52.120 --> 05:52.960]  Come hang out.
[05:52.960 --> 05:55.240]  It's hard to escape my life.
[05:56.200 --> 05:57.920]  Escape from Alcatraz.
[05:57.920 --> 05:58.760]  All right.
[06:01.200 --> 06:02.920]  That last dab still got me ringing.
[06:02.920 --> 06:06.200]  Mike turned purple and white and purple again.
[06:06.200 --> 06:07.880]  All right, guys, we do have a kind of a topic
[06:07.880 --> 06:09.840]  for this podcast here, and the word
[06:09.840 --> 06:12.240]  that I wrote down was cop math.
[06:12.240 --> 06:13.080]  Cop math.
[06:13.080 --> 06:13.920]  Cop math.
[06:13.920 --> 06:15.000]  It infuriates Mike.
[06:15.000 --> 06:15.840]  Infuriates Mike.
[06:15.840 --> 06:17.200]  Is that the appropriate word?
[06:17.200 --> 06:18.040]  It is.
[06:18.040 --> 06:19.040]  Mike's changing colors over there.
[06:19.040 --> 06:21.720]  Just thinking about it, he's squirming in his seat.
[06:21.720 --> 06:22.720]  Cop math.
[06:23.760 --> 06:28.760]  So anytime reporters report on a marijuana bust
[06:29.920 --> 06:34.640]  of any kind, they give a money total at some point.
[06:34.640 --> 06:38.840]  For example, there's a bunch of reports
[06:38.840 --> 06:42.280]  lately out of Colorado where they're summarizing
[06:42.280 --> 06:47.280]  whole counties in so many busts over a year period of time.
[06:48.440 --> 06:50.160]  And then they total up everything they found.
[06:50.160 --> 06:51.680]  We found 7,000 plants.
[06:51.680 --> 06:56.680]  We found, we arrested 50 people, da, da, da, da, da, da.
[06:56.840 --> 06:59.040]  And then there's always a math problem at the end
[06:59.040 --> 07:01.600]  that says, you know, this is all worth.
[07:01.600 --> 07:03.120]  And then they give a really big number,
[07:03.120 --> 07:06.680]  as big as the cop can say with a straight face
[07:06.680 --> 07:08.880]  is usually the number given to the reporter.
[07:10.200 --> 07:13.520]  And if you dig a little bit or do the math yourself,
[07:14.480 --> 07:18.640]  the math gets insane and really funny really quickly.
[07:18.640 --> 07:21.160]  And it's just sort of a running joke now
[07:21.160 --> 07:23.680]  that cop pop math is terrible.
[07:23.680 --> 07:25.240]  Cop drug math is terrible.
[07:25.240 --> 07:27.120]  All the drug math, but especially with pop.
[07:27.120 --> 07:28.800]  Because marijuana is the most,
[07:28.800 --> 07:32.400]  well, it's also the most sold illegal drug.
[07:32.400 --> 07:33.880]  It's legal lots of places now,
[07:33.880 --> 07:36.920]  but just in that classification,
[07:36.920 --> 07:38.720]  way more people are buying marijuana.
[07:38.720 --> 07:39.680]  There's more of it to find.
[07:39.680 --> 07:41.120]  It's easier to find.
[07:41.120 --> 07:42.480]  So it gets found a lot more.
[07:42.480 --> 07:44.320]  So these reports come out a lot more often
[07:44.320 --> 07:47.240]  and they're always fucking nuts.
[07:47.240 --> 07:52.080]  So you can pull interviews with a Pueblo Sheriff
[07:53.080 --> 07:55.640]  or the county right up North of us,
[07:55.640 --> 07:58.000]  El Paso County, their sheriff,
[07:58.000 --> 07:59.600]  have been given reports a lot lately.
[07:59.600 --> 08:00.680]  They're really easy to find
[08:00.680 --> 08:05.080]  if you just Google Colorado Sheriff marijuana bust
[08:05.080 --> 08:07.560]  and look at the numbers in the report,
[08:07.560 --> 08:09.120]  the sheriffs will go on at length
[08:09.160 --> 08:13.800]  about how fast they think marijuana grows,
[08:13.800 --> 08:15.360]  how much they think it's worth.
[08:16.600 --> 08:19.560]  And reporters do absolutely no effort to check all this.
[08:19.560 --> 08:22.000]  So the numbers that get reported are just insane.
[08:25.440 --> 08:26.960]  Do you think the numbers are sort of like
[08:26.960 --> 08:28.640]  a game of telephone?
[08:28.640 --> 08:30.480]  Like the guy that makes the bust says,
[08:30.480 --> 08:32.160]  we found two grams of cannabis.
[08:32.160 --> 08:35.040]  And the Sergeant says, they found five grams of cannabis.
[08:35.040 --> 08:36.600]  And whoever's ahead of them goes,
[08:36.600 --> 08:38.120]  they found 12 grams of cannabis.
[08:38.120 --> 08:39.360]  And they report it to the police
[08:39.360 --> 08:40.960]  or the news and the news says,
[08:40.960 --> 08:43.040]  they found 24 pounds of cannabis.
[08:43.040 --> 08:45.520]  You think it goes like that quite often?
[08:45.520 --> 08:48.680]  There was a lot more of that when we were coming up.
[08:48.680 --> 08:50.080]  Okay.
[08:50.080 --> 08:52.000]  You'd get busted with a quarter
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.440]  and then the report would say 15.
[08:55.440 --> 08:58.760]  And then the eventual charge you face in court
[08:58.760 --> 08:59.640]  would be under an ounce.
[08:59.640 --> 09:01.360]  And you're like, hey, wait a second.
[09:02.360 --> 09:07.360]  But now more it's the cops need a way to justify
[09:09.960 --> 09:12.640]  what they're doing and the effort they're putting in.
[09:12.640 --> 09:16.720]  And so they've come up with a math problem
[09:16.720 --> 09:19.640]  that makes any size marijuana bust
[09:19.640 --> 09:22.520]  look like darn good police work.
[09:22.520 --> 09:24.440]  And the math they use,
[09:24.440 --> 09:26.160]  and they're happy to give this to reporters
[09:26.160 --> 09:29.720]  and reporters are universally too lazy to check this.
[09:29.720 --> 09:31.040]  And it's really easy to check now.
[09:31.720 --> 09:33.160]  You just call a marijuana grow
[09:33.160 --> 09:34.600]  and ask to speak to someone.
[09:36.560 --> 09:38.760]  Reporters, I'm available.
[09:38.760 --> 09:43.600]  But the math the cops use is every single marijuana plant,
[09:43.600 --> 09:44.920]  every single one,
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.320]  harvests one pound of usable product every 90 days.
[09:50.240 --> 09:51.080]  Every plant?
[09:51.080 --> 09:52.880]  Every plant, every single plant.
[09:52.880 --> 09:54.440]  These plants also use,
[09:54.440 --> 09:57.000]  every single one of them uses six gallons of water a day,
[09:57.000 --> 09:58.600]  but that's a whole nother rant.
[09:58.600 --> 09:59.440]  So.
[10:00.400 --> 10:01.240]  But yeah, that's.
[10:01.240 --> 10:02.080]  Well, that may be worth it.
[10:02.080 --> 10:05.240]  The cops tell the reporters over and over and over again,
[10:05.240 --> 10:08.960]  one marijuana plant, one pound of usable product
[10:08.960 --> 10:12.440]  every 90 days, any idiot can do it.
[10:12.440 --> 10:14.000]  Doesn't, it's not that hard.
[10:15.920 --> 10:18.360]  Every grower I know is like, fuck I wish.
[10:18.360 --> 10:20.040]  Yeah, I'm growing the wrong genetics or something
[10:20.040 --> 10:22.920]  if that is the case, I've got all the wrong shit.
[10:22.920 --> 10:25.840]  And nah, for the last several years,
[10:25.840 --> 10:29.000]  the sheriffs in Colorado then take it a step further
[10:29.560 --> 10:32.040]  and say, and these growers were going to haul it
[10:32.040 --> 10:34.280]  to Florida or New York City,
[10:34.280 --> 10:38.080]  where it was going to sell for three to 4,000 a pound,
[10:39.160 --> 10:42.440]  which that part of the math isn't totally nuts,
[10:42.440 --> 10:44.680]  but they're leaving out a big piece of the story,
[10:44.680 --> 10:46.560]  which is why they have to drive it so far
[10:46.560 --> 10:48.440]  to make that kind of money on it.
[10:48.440 --> 10:50.600]  Because it wasn't that long ago
[10:50.600 --> 10:53.560]  when a pound of marijuana costs that much here, right?
[10:54.760 --> 10:55.880]  It doesn't anymore.
[10:55.880 --> 10:57.040]  And there's a reason for that,
[10:57.080 --> 10:59.320]  that the cops do not want to talk about.
[11:00.600 --> 11:05.200]  But the rant here is we got to get reporters
[11:05.200 --> 11:06.440]  to check on this stuff.
[11:06.440 --> 11:10.680]  And so I need a favor from the listening community.
[11:10.680 --> 11:14.840]  When you see marijuana news articles on social media,
[11:14.840 --> 11:18.400]  please jump in the comment section and very politely say,
[11:18.400 --> 11:21.000]  hey, news lady, hey, news guy,
[11:22.600 --> 11:24.240]  any way to check that math?
[11:24.240 --> 11:25.080]  Right.
[11:25.080 --> 11:26.480]  And call them out on their bullshit.
[11:26.920 --> 11:27.760]  And if we do this enough,
[11:27.760 --> 11:30.440]  reporters will start asking cops the question.
[11:30.440 --> 11:31.640]  The reason they don't now
[11:31.640 --> 11:33.840]  is there's no one who gives a fuck.
[11:33.840 --> 11:37.440]  The cops love to tell them the numbers
[11:37.440 --> 11:39.360]  much larger than it really is.
[11:39.360 --> 11:41.040]  The reporter is happier to report
[11:41.040 --> 11:44.160]  on a million dollar drug bus versus a thousand dollar
[11:44.160 --> 11:45.560]  drug bus.
[11:45.560 --> 11:49.320]  And everybody goes on pretending
[11:49.320 --> 11:51.560]  that this was some huge deal.
[11:51.560 --> 11:53.200]  And no one calls them on their bullshit.
[11:53.200 --> 11:54.640]  And it's starting to drive me nuts.
[11:54.640 --> 11:58.000]  So when Jeff said we need a topic for the podcast,
[11:58.000 --> 11:58.840]  what do you got?
[11:58.840 --> 12:01.120]  I said, I want to rant about cop math.
[12:02.080 --> 12:02.920]  And it was a perfect topic.
[12:02.920 --> 12:04.560]  We got to start calling these motherfuckers out.
[12:04.560 --> 12:07.000]  So the first thing that I find hilarious,
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.920]  one plant, one pound, 90 days.
[12:10.920 --> 12:12.120]  Man.
[12:12.120 --> 12:14.840]  Pull up the recent busts in Colorado.
[12:14.840 --> 12:17.320]  They love laying the plants out in the driveway now.
[12:17.320 --> 12:18.160]  I love those pictures.
[12:18.160 --> 12:21.800]  And they're all 18 to 24 inch tall veg plants.
[12:21.800 --> 12:23.600]  That's what they keep laying out in the driveway.
[12:23.600 --> 12:26.720]  They're not throwing down a three gallon pot
[12:26.720 --> 12:31.720]  with a quarter pound of usable material size plant.
[12:31.960 --> 12:34.320]  They're throwing, it's a four inch pot.
[12:34.320 --> 12:36.160]  It's a 20 inch tall plant.
[12:36.160 --> 12:37.640]  They're laying it down in the driveway.
[12:37.640 --> 12:40.200]  And they're telling reporters straight faced
[12:40.200 --> 12:43.640]  that that plant drinks six gallons of water a day.
[12:43.640 --> 12:44.640]  Very not true.
[12:45.680 --> 12:48.880]  Is going to produce a pound of usable bud in 90 days.
[12:48.880 --> 12:50.240]  Very untrue.
[12:50.240 --> 12:53.560]  And that that's super easy to make $3,000 a pound on.
[12:53.560 --> 12:54.840]  Very untrue.
[12:54.840 --> 12:58.240]  Right, it's three hardcore lies to the reporter's face.
[12:58.240 --> 13:00.760]  And the reporter goes, thank you for lying to me, officer.
[13:00.760 --> 13:03.480]  And reports it is gospel.
[13:03.480 --> 13:05.160]  And then the people that see it on the news
[13:05.160 --> 13:07.000]  that don't have any clue, they believe it.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.560]  And then now they are on that side.
[13:09.560 --> 13:11.160]  They are on prohibition side.
[13:11.160 --> 13:15.480]  And like at this point, cops lie.
[13:15.480 --> 13:16.520]  Everybody's used to it.
[13:16.520 --> 13:17.360]  Who gives a shit?
[13:17.360 --> 13:18.840]  Reporters are dumb and lazy.
[13:18.840 --> 13:20.200]  Who gives a shit?
[13:21.000 --> 13:22.280]  But this has real world implications.
[13:22.280 --> 13:23.320]  Like at a certain point,
[13:23.320 --> 13:25.880]  the people who get charged with these busts
[13:25.880 --> 13:28.960]  end up in jail trying to explain to a judge
[13:28.960 --> 13:33.960]  that the $1,500 the cops found was three months profit.
[13:35.280 --> 13:36.960]  And they're making pennies.
[13:36.960 --> 13:40.440]  And the cops are pretending that these guys are kingpins.
[13:40.440 --> 13:41.320]  It's insane.
[13:42.640 --> 13:45.280]  And that's another thing that we were going to segue
[13:45.280 --> 13:48.200]  into sort of is the value that they put on this stuff.
[13:48.200 --> 13:49.880]  They say that some of these busts
[13:49.880 --> 13:51.400]  are worth millions of dollars.
[13:51.400 --> 13:52.720]  They'll find a few pounds
[13:52.720 --> 13:55.200]  and then try to exaggerate the cost of the pounds.
[13:56.120 --> 13:57.280]  Where do they get those numbers?
[13:57.280 --> 13:58.280]  Did they just create it?
[13:58.280 --> 14:01.760]  Well, there's always a lot of information in the reports
[14:01.760 --> 14:04.480]  that gives a lie or gives away the lie
[14:04.480 --> 14:07.520]  that the reporter and the cop are trying to tell the reader.
[14:07.520 --> 14:11.160]  If you read between the lines, you start asking yourself,
[14:11.160 --> 14:14.360]  well, the dude only has like 30 plants in his basement.
[14:14.360 --> 14:17.240]  He had 15 pounds of products stashed up.
[14:17.240 --> 14:21.440]  That's like three harvests worth of product he had on hand.
[14:21.440 --> 14:24.920]  Why can't homeboy move his product any faster than that?
[14:24.920 --> 14:27.960]  If this is really worth millions and millions of dollars
[14:27.960 --> 14:30.140]  and it's a black market cash only business,
[14:30.140 --> 14:32.920]  why did fuck nuts only have $1,500 in the house?
[14:34.120 --> 14:37.560]  The cops love to rant about all the guns they find,
[14:37.560 --> 14:41.280]  but there's almost never a shot fired during these raids
[14:41.280 --> 14:44.700]  because the cops aren't or the guns aren't for the cops.
[14:44.700 --> 14:48.420]  The guns are for the robbers that the cops entice to go there
[14:48.420 --> 14:50.780]  by giving these bullshit reports to reporters.
[14:50.780 --> 14:53.620]  Or the guns are just the guns because it's Colorado
[14:53.620 --> 14:54.460]  and there are-
[14:54.460 --> 14:55.280]  It's America.
[14:55.280 --> 14:56.940]  Yeah, and sometimes if you live in the right area,
[14:56.940 --> 14:58.460]  you can get a fucking bear in your front yard
[14:58.460 --> 15:00.460]  and you may want a gun sometimes.
[15:00.460 --> 15:02.620]  There's a real story in Colorado right now
[15:02.620 --> 15:06.340]  where a jogger was attacked by a mountain lion
[15:06.340 --> 15:08.660]  and choked that fucking thing to death with his bare hands.
[15:08.660 --> 15:09.500]  Yeah, big shout out to that guy.
[15:09.500 --> 15:11.100]  Most people aren't that hardcore.
[15:11.220 --> 15:15.980]  I've seen people jogging on trails in Colorado
[15:15.980 --> 15:18.440]  with firearms because there are wildlife
[15:18.440 --> 15:19.280]  that might attack you.
[15:19.280 --> 15:20.120]  Like, that's a real thing here.
[15:20.120 --> 15:20.960]  Absolutely.
[15:24.180 --> 15:25.740]  But no one cares about the guns
[15:25.740 --> 15:26.820]  until you put weed next to them.
[15:26.820 --> 15:28.820]  It's just something to add to the report
[15:28.820 --> 15:30.380]  to make these people sound dangerous.
[15:30.380 --> 15:31.300]  Sensationalism.
[15:31.300 --> 15:32.140]  Yep.
[15:32.140 --> 15:33.660]  Fear, it sells.
[15:33.660 --> 15:35.660]  Yeah, there's a lot of bullshit in these reports
[15:35.660 --> 15:39.020]  and it just shines through to anyone with a slight clue.
[15:39.020 --> 15:40.060]  And it drives me nuts
[15:40.060 --> 15:43.300]  that more people don't call this stuff out.
[15:43.300 --> 15:44.860]  I think a lot of times what they're trying to do,
[15:44.860 --> 15:46.700]  if they find, we'll say, five pounds,
[15:46.700 --> 15:49.100]  they try to break that down into gram price
[15:49.100 --> 15:51.380]  and then they highly exaggerate gram price
[15:51.380 --> 15:53.220]  and then they multiply however,
[15:53.220 --> 15:55.820]  so however many grams times however many pounds
[15:55.820 --> 15:57.140]  or however many pounds.
[15:57.140 --> 15:59.140]  Yeah, they do the math and they say this many dollars
[15:59.140 --> 16:01.620]  and they do it by grams at like 50 bucks a gram
[16:01.620 --> 16:04.420]  because at the very smallest level,
[16:04.420 --> 16:05.620]  somewhere that's happening.
[16:05.620 --> 16:07.820]  There's a $60, $50 gram happening somewhere,
[16:07.820 --> 16:10.940]  I don't know where, but some inner city place.
[16:10.940 --> 16:12.740]  I was gonna say Baltimore, I don't know.
[16:12.740 --> 16:15.500]  But somewhere like that, that I don't know anybody.
[16:15.500 --> 16:16.420]  I do, I know, what's up Josh,
[16:16.420 --> 16:17.860]  if you're down there listening, sorry bro.
[16:17.860 --> 16:21.620]  But it's maybe a huge commodity to get a gram
[16:21.620 --> 16:23.900]  all the way down to Baltimore or wherever you said
[16:23.900 --> 16:25.580]  or Kentucky or wherever, that's a little effort.
[16:25.580 --> 16:27.620]  You gotta get it there, it costs more.
[16:27.620 --> 16:31.020]  So 60 a gram, then you multiply that by a pound,
[16:31.020 --> 16:32.940]  then you multiply that by five pounds,
[16:32.940 --> 16:35.460]  then it almost adds up to their inflated numbers
[16:35.460 --> 16:36.460]  but they've gotta be going
[16:36.500 --> 16:39.100]  at their most ridiculous prices.
[16:39.100 --> 16:40.700]  They don't even try.
[16:40.700 --> 16:43.620]  They just guesstimate a wholesale number
[16:43.620 --> 16:45.220]  that sounds big and scary.
[16:45.220 --> 16:47.020]  Yeah, well if they're doing it by the gram price,
[16:47.020 --> 16:48.780]  nobody's making that chunk of money.
[16:48.780 --> 16:50.780]  There's so many hands it passes through.
[16:50.780 --> 16:53.140]  You got the guy that took it from wherever,
[16:53.140 --> 16:53.980]  from California or Colorado.
[16:53.980 --> 16:56.300]  Anybody selling pounds by the gram
[16:56.300 --> 17:00.660]  is buying those pounds wholesale at a shitty price.
[17:00.660 --> 17:04.140]  Right, the guy delivering them probably made 100 a pound.
[17:04.140 --> 17:05.860]  The guy that bought them probably,
[17:05.860 --> 17:08.140]  the guy that sold them originally made 100 a pound profit.
[17:08.140 --> 17:09.820]  So by the time they get all the way down there,
[17:09.820 --> 17:12.180]  there's one, two, three guys making 100 bucks each
[17:12.180 --> 17:13.380]  off of each pound.
[17:13.380 --> 17:15.740]  Then they land into some guy
[17:15.740 --> 17:17.620]  who sells to the whole neighborhood.
[17:17.620 --> 17:18.820]  He buys a pound of it.
[17:18.820 --> 17:21.660]  Then it breaks down into probably quarters, eights.
[17:21.660 --> 17:23.900]  And then a couple of guys buy quarters and eights
[17:23.900 --> 17:27.340]  or ounces from him and probably sell grams at a bat.
[17:27.340 --> 17:29.620]  There's not one person making a whole fucking mountain
[17:29.620 --> 17:30.820]  of money off of any of that.
[17:30.820 --> 17:34.580]  If you're unfamiliar with the process Jeff just outlined,
[17:34.580 --> 17:36.860]  pull up the union on YouTube.
[17:36.860 --> 17:39.460]  It's a movie called the union.
[17:39.460 --> 17:41.580]  It goes through all of this.
[17:41.580 --> 17:43.580]  I think it was done in 2004.
[17:43.580 --> 17:45.860]  It's quite old, but it still applies.
[17:45.860 --> 17:50.260]  It's literally, it's the exact model that's been used
[17:50.260 --> 17:53.100]  across the planet for the last 20 years.
[17:53.100 --> 17:54.620]  That's why I can talk about it so easily
[17:54.620 --> 17:56.180]  because I understand that economics,
[17:56.180 --> 17:57.340]  it goes from here to here to here to here.
[17:57.340 --> 17:59.100]  One of the things that's driving me nuts
[17:59.100 --> 18:01.140]  is the reports I'm bitching about
[18:01.140 --> 18:03.180]  don't understand that process.
[18:03.180 --> 18:04.460]  They think it's new.
[18:05.540 --> 18:10.540]  And there's no, I mean, we've had legal marijuana stores
[18:12.460 --> 18:14.660]  for five years now in Colorado,
[18:14.660 --> 18:19.100]  and there's still zero effort to check on the numbers.
[18:19.100 --> 18:22.580]  They don't even bother reporting the average market rate
[18:22.580 --> 18:23.980]  of wholesale pounds in Colorado,
[18:23.980 --> 18:26.380]  which is a number they report in other articles.
[18:28.100 --> 18:29.900]  They just, they immediately go to,
[18:29.900 --> 18:33.660]  and all of this marijuana we found in Albert County
[18:33.660 --> 18:36.100]  is worth this much in Florida.
[18:36.100 --> 18:38.140]  And so that's, we're calling the size of the bus.
[18:38.140 --> 18:39.500]  And it's like, well,
[18:39.500 --> 18:42.380]  they had to drive it all the way to Florida still.
[18:42.380 --> 18:45.460]  Like it's not, if you have to take it somewhere
[18:45.460 --> 18:46.980]  to make it worth something,
[18:46.980 --> 18:48.700]  why are we pretending it's worth that now?
[18:48.700 --> 18:51.420]  And I don't know, I'm talking,
[18:51.420 --> 18:53.140]  all right, that's my rant, guys.
[18:53.140 --> 18:57.300]  Well, that was Mike's rant about cop math.
[18:57.300 --> 18:58.740]  Call these sons of bitches out.
[18:58.780 --> 19:01.700]  Facebook, Twitter, wherever you can do it, please.
[19:02.580 --> 19:05.940]  Or hit me up at Nemopunk15 on Twitter and tell me no.
[19:07.700 --> 19:08.780]  Talk back to Mike.
[19:08.780 --> 19:10.700]  That's what we want, feedback at Mike.
[19:12.580 --> 19:14.060]  Man, I've got two more notes left
[19:14.060 --> 19:17.380]  and they are on similar topics, but the opposite.
[19:17.380 --> 19:19.780]  Mike's saying call the cops out.
[19:19.780 --> 19:22.340]  I learned, Mike's saying to call the cops out,
[19:22.340 --> 19:24.420]  but I wrote down some other stuff.
[19:25.420 --> 19:26.580]  If you're interacting with the cops,
[19:26.580 --> 19:29.060]  they've only got about eight minutes to mess with you.
[19:29.060 --> 19:31.220]  That's about the average time of a traffic stop,
[19:31.220 --> 19:32.340]  eight minutes.
[19:32.340 --> 19:33.700]  During that eight minutes,
[19:35.020 --> 19:35.860]  I learned this somewhere,
[19:35.860 --> 19:36.900]  I'm gonna give them a shout out at the end of this.
[19:36.900 --> 19:37.740]  During that eight minutes,
[19:37.740 --> 19:40.100]  their goal is to try to get you to say something stupid
[19:40.100 --> 19:41.980]  so that they can fuck with you.
[19:41.980 --> 19:43.540]  If they had a reason to arrest you,
[19:43.540 --> 19:45.420]  they already would have gotten you out of the car.
[19:45.420 --> 19:46.980]  They're waiting for you to fuck up.
[19:46.980 --> 19:49.260]  Or they're just waiting for that 10-5 to come back
[19:49.260 --> 19:50.540]  and tell them that you got a warrant.
[19:50.540 --> 19:51.740]  But if you don't have a warrant,
[19:51.740 --> 19:52.860]  if you don't have any problems,
[19:52.860 --> 19:54.780]  they would have already gotten you out of the car.
[19:54.820 --> 19:57.020]  So my best advice when you're dealing with law enforcement,
[19:57.020 --> 19:59.660]  other than on the internet and calling them out for shit,
[19:59.660 --> 20:01.380]  is to shut the fuck up.
[20:01.380 --> 20:02.700]  Don't say anything when you're messing with the cops.
[20:02.700 --> 20:03.820]  Yes, sir, no, sir.
[20:03.820 --> 20:04.940]  And you don't have to answer anything.
[20:04.940 --> 20:07.140]  We're talking about very different scenarios here.
[20:07.140 --> 20:10.380]  I'm talking about asking listeners to call bullshit
[20:10.380 --> 20:11.540]  on internet news stories.
[20:11.540 --> 20:15.300]  They see where cops are laughably wrong about pop math.
[20:15.300 --> 20:17.580]  Just talking about face-to-face interactions
[20:17.580 --> 20:19.620]  with police officers, very different circumstances.
[20:19.620 --> 20:20.460]  Yes, yes.
[20:20.460 --> 20:21.300]  Huge, huge segue in there.
[20:21.300 --> 20:23.900]  They're not your friend, they're not there to help you.
[20:24.340 --> 20:26.740]  They can offer you no assistance in any way, shape,
[20:26.740 --> 20:27.580]  or form.
[20:27.580 --> 20:29.700]  They're there to find a reason to take you to jail
[20:29.700 --> 20:31.300]  or to leave you alone while they go look
[20:31.300 --> 20:33.420]  for someone else to take to jail.
[20:33.420 --> 20:35.780]  Think of it like a commission sales job.
[20:35.780 --> 20:36.700]  They're gonna walk up to you,
[20:36.700 --> 20:38.020]  they're gonna pitch you a product.
[20:38.020 --> 20:39.540]  If you're not buying or in eight minutes,
[20:39.540 --> 20:41.660]  they're gonna try to find somebody who's got a bigger wallet
[20:41.660 --> 20:43.260]  so that they can dig a little deeper
[20:43.260 --> 20:44.940]  and get something out of that wallet.
[20:44.940 --> 20:47.100]  So when you're with the law enforcement,
[20:47.100 --> 20:48.140]  try to handle it out.
[20:48.140 --> 20:49.860]  Five, seven, maybe eight minutes.
[20:49.860 --> 20:52.500]  Most traffic stops will last you about five to eight minutes.
[20:52.500 --> 20:53.620]  Don't say anything stupid.
[20:54.340 --> 20:55.340]  Don't answer questions.
[20:55.340 --> 20:57.060]  You don't have to talk about your day.
[20:57.060 --> 20:58.380]  The best thing you can say is,
[20:58.380 --> 21:00.260]  I don't really wanna talk about my day, sir.
[21:00.260 --> 21:02.620]  Just, I don't wanna talk about my day, sir.
[21:02.620 --> 21:04.980]  Put your head down or look him dead in the eye.
[21:04.980 --> 21:07.380]  Just body language that you were done speaking.
[21:07.380 --> 21:09.580]  You don't have to talk about anything if you don't want to,
[21:09.580 --> 21:10.900]  so don't do that.
[21:10.900 --> 21:12.020]  Another thing that I was reminded,
[21:12.020 --> 21:13.300]  I'm gonna give people a shout out here.
[21:13.300 --> 21:14.700]  Somebody, I owe somebody a huge shout out
[21:14.700 --> 21:15.940]  for giving this message.
[21:16.820 --> 21:19.220]  If you choose to invoke the fifth,
[21:19.220 --> 21:21.900]  you have to actually say the phrase,
[21:21.900 --> 21:23.260]  I choose to invoke the fifth.
[21:23.820 --> 21:25.540]  There's a great series of videos
[21:25.540 --> 21:28.100]  that you can look up called Flex Your Rights.
[21:28.100 --> 21:31.260]  Flex like a muscle, your rights.
[21:31.260 --> 21:33.180]  The lawyer's name is Billy Murphy.
[21:34.460 --> 21:36.700]  I think it's a Baltimore lawyer actually.
[21:36.700 --> 21:38.820]  Does some great, great videos.
[21:38.820 --> 21:40.540]  Everyone should know and watch these.
[21:40.540 --> 21:43.260]  Also go follow the Pot Brothers at Law.
[21:43.260 --> 21:44.100]  You will learn a lot from these guys.
[21:44.100 --> 21:45.980]  My wife sent me that link last night.
[21:45.980 --> 21:49.260]  I laughed thinking, because she thought I hadn't seen it.
[21:49.260 --> 21:51.780]  But yeah, it's another great video.
[21:51.820 --> 21:53.780]  Watch it, know your rights, exercise them.
[21:53.780 --> 21:56.540]  Yes, learn how to interact with law enforcement.
[21:56.540 --> 21:57.900]  It will help you out.
[21:57.900 --> 22:00.180]  There's a lot of videos online
[22:00.180 --> 22:03.220]  where you can watch people exercising their rights
[22:03.220 --> 22:05.180]  in a real dickish fashion,
[22:05.180 --> 22:06.700]  where their goal is to say,
[22:06.700 --> 22:09.420]  ha ha, fuck you, you can't mess with me.
[22:09.420 --> 22:11.020]  You don't need to do that.
[22:11.020 --> 22:16.020]  There's super easy ways to exercise 100% of your rights,
[22:16.020 --> 22:17.980]  refuse to answer questions,
[22:17.980 --> 22:20.020]  not give them more than you're legally allowed
[22:20.180 --> 22:21.260]  or obligated to,
[22:22.180 --> 22:25.020]  and really hold your ground without at all being a dick.
[22:25.020 --> 22:27.220]  Right, you are a civil person.
[22:27.220 --> 22:28.820]  Hopefully the law enforcement
[22:28.820 --> 22:31.860]  in which you are interacting with is a civil dude.
[22:31.860 --> 22:33.500]  Don't go out of your way to be a dick,
[22:33.500 --> 22:36.020]  then he's going to go out of his way to be a dick.
[22:36.020 --> 22:39.260]  Most law enforcement are just men with jobs
[22:39.260 --> 22:41.340]  trying to do right, most.
[22:41.340 --> 22:44.980]  There are a lot of fucking dickheads, trust me.
[22:44.980 --> 22:47.460]  But a lot of them are just honorable men
[22:47.460 --> 22:49.420]  trying to do an honorable job.
[22:49.420 --> 22:51.740]  They've got rules to follow
[22:51.740 --> 22:54.620]  and they want us to follow certain rules.
[22:54.620 --> 22:56.260]  So don't fuck with them.
[22:56.260 --> 22:58.740]  Just, I don't feel like discussing my day,
[22:58.740 --> 23:01.220]  here's my paperwork, do all the things they ask for,
[23:01.220 --> 23:03.060]  comply, but don't poke the bear.
[23:03.060 --> 23:05.940]  There's no need to poke the bear.
[23:07.260 --> 23:08.300]  Exactly.
[23:08.300 --> 23:10.980]  Another thing, I really think it's time
[23:10.980 --> 23:14.420]  that if the police are going to expect me
[23:14.420 --> 23:15.860]  to follow all these rules
[23:15.860 --> 23:18.220]  and if I do one stupid thing wrong,
[23:18.220 --> 23:20.220]  they can pull me over, they can fuck with my whole day,
[23:20.220 --> 23:21.660]  possibly ruin my entire life
[23:21.660 --> 23:24.660]  based on a few decisions that they decide to make that day.
[23:24.660 --> 23:27.100]  Just depends on, it's all situational, who knows?
[23:28.500 --> 23:30.660]  I wish they would be held accountable
[23:30.660 --> 23:33.940]  and somebody would police the police.
[23:33.940 --> 23:36.740]  Whenever I feel the urge or need to.
[23:36.740 --> 23:38.180]  Like whenever it's a legitimate thing,
[23:38.180 --> 23:39.300]  like it's a safety thing,
[23:39.300 --> 23:42.780]  or if a cop goes bombing by me at 100 with no lights on,
[23:42.780 --> 23:44.180]  I'll call state patrol and be like,
[23:44.180 --> 23:47.820]  there's a white charger doing 110 up I-25.
[23:48.460 --> 23:50.500]  Their license plate is, fuck them.
[23:51.700 --> 23:53.820]  There was a dude who liked a state trooper
[23:53.820 --> 23:55.940]  that liked to park in the median on a highway
[23:55.940 --> 23:57.140]  you and I drive all the time.
[23:57.140 --> 23:59.020]  Dude, that cop has scared the shit out of me
[23:59.020 --> 24:00.980]  a couple of times because that's a terrible spot.
[24:00.980 --> 24:03.460]  Okay, so it's a divided highway, folks.
[24:03.460 --> 24:05.900]  So there's lanes on the right, there's lanes on the left,
[24:05.900 --> 24:08.220]  there's a green belt in the middle.
[24:08.220 --> 24:11.500]  There's an intersection across this, so there's a stoplight.
[24:11.500 --> 24:14.220]  There's like nine lanes of moving traffic.
[24:14.220 --> 24:16.820]  And motherfucker would park in kind of a hard to spot,
[24:16.820 --> 24:20.020]  hard to see spot facing in a direction
[24:20.020 --> 24:25.020]  so that he could not legally drive into a lane of traffic
[24:25.300 --> 24:28.980]  without doing so in a way that was blind to the driver
[24:28.980 --> 24:30.940]  supposed to be heading to where he was.
[24:30.940 --> 24:32.580]  I'm not explaining this well.
[24:32.580 --> 24:33.620]  Good enough, though.
[24:33.620 --> 24:35.140]  He was in a dipshit ass spot.
[24:35.140 --> 24:38.220]  If this fucking cop pulled out after anybody,
[24:38.220 --> 24:41.220]  the odds he created an accident were 100%.
[24:41.220 --> 24:44.460]  Also, coming up, when you're approaching an intersection,
[24:44.460 --> 24:45.700]  if you drive at all like me,
[24:45.740 --> 24:47.980]  I'm scanning that intersection before I come up to it
[24:47.980 --> 24:50.420]  so I could see if anybody's gonna turn in front of me
[24:50.420 --> 24:52.460]  or I could see if anybody's gonna pull out from,
[24:52.460 --> 24:54.220]  just run the red light and T-bone me.
[24:54.220 --> 24:55.580]  I'm kind of scanning.
[24:55.580 --> 24:56.980]  That cop would park in such a way
[24:56.980 --> 24:59.140]  that he would just disrupt my view of everything
[24:59.140 --> 25:00.420]  and I would have to hit the brakes and be like,
[25:00.420 --> 25:02.860]  what the fuck is that weird car doing in the middle?
[25:02.860 --> 25:03.820]  Because you're not gonna hit him
[25:03.820 --> 25:05.260]  because the way the lanes are aligned,
[25:05.260 --> 25:07.060]  you'll go right around him.
[25:07.060 --> 25:10.420]  But he's a weird obstruction of your view.
[25:10.420 --> 25:11.820]  You're wondering why there's a vehicle
[25:11.820 --> 25:13.180]  where there shouldn't be a vehicle.
[25:13.180 --> 25:14.980]  You start looking at that vehicle
[25:15.020 --> 25:16.540]  instead of where you should be.
[25:16.540 --> 25:17.700]  You should be looking at the lights.
[25:17.700 --> 25:18.740]  You should be looking at the lane.
[25:18.740 --> 25:19.860]  Instead, you're going, what is that?
[25:19.860 --> 25:20.700]  Is that moving?
[25:20.700 --> 25:21.540]  Is it parked?
[25:21.540 --> 25:22.380]  Am I gonna hit it?
[25:22.380 --> 25:23.220]  Is it coming at me?
[25:23.220 --> 25:24.660]  Why is that guy there?
[25:24.660 --> 25:26.180]  Are they in need of assistance?
[25:26.180 --> 25:27.020]  Is it a wreck?
[25:27.020 --> 25:27.860]  Are there more of them?
[25:27.860 --> 25:28.700]  Is there a wreck that I'm not seeing?
[25:28.700 --> 25:30.900]  Yeah, so it's really, it's more of a hazard
[25:30.900 --> 25:32.100]  than any sort of help he could ever be in that spot.
[25:32.100 --> 25:34.460]  Every time I would see that dipshit,
[25:34.460 --> 25:36.780]  and this happened a half dozen times
[25:36.780 --> 25:38.020]  over like a four month period
[25:38.020 --> 25:40.220]  before he stopped parking there,
[25:40.220 --> 25:43.820]  I would call the non-emergency number for State Patrol
[25:43.820 --> 25:46.780]  and say either there's a disabled charger in the spot.
[25:46.780 --> 25:48.220]  And after the first couple of calls,
[25:48.220 --> 25:51.500]  I just gave up the disabled car ruse and just said,
[25:51.500 --> 25:54.940]  okay, so I know you guys don't tell them where to park,
[25:54.940 --> 25:57.500]  but if this dude pulls out in a hurry for any reason,
[25:57.500 --> 25:59.540]  he's gonna hurt or kill someone.
[25:59.540 --> 26:02.020]  It's a terrible, like someone needs to talk to this idiot
[26:02.020 --> 26:03.420]  and be like, okay, I get that you're trying
[26:03.420 --> 26:06.180]  to do sneaky speed enforcement.
[26:06.180 --> 26:08.940]  Park somewhere where you're not gonna kill people
[26:08.940 --> 26:09.780]  pulling out.
[26:09.780 --> 26:10.620]  Yeah.
[26:11.620 --> 26:14.580]  It's just, homeboy don't park there no more.
[26:14.580 --> 26:16.900]  But there's absolutely no rule that says
[26:16.900 --> 26:19.020]  you can't call the cops on the cops.
[26:19.020 --> 26:21.420]  And I think if more people did this more often,
[26:21.420 --> 26:23.180]  it would solve a couple of things.
[26:23.180 --> 26:24.020]  I agree.
[26:24.020 --> 26:25.980]  That's how we got him to stop running around everywhere
[26:25.980 --> 26:27.580]  at a hundred miles an hour.
[26:27.580 --> 26:30.180]  Like when we were kids, that shit was common.
[26:30.180 --> 26:31.780]  Now you almost never see it.
[26:31.780 --> 26:33.860]  I grew up just a city,
[26:33.860 --> 26:36.060]  oh, I grew up on Compton Boulevard, literally.
[26:36.060 --> 26:37.540]  Like the street at the end of my block
[26:37.540 --> 26:38.620]  was Compton Boulevard.
[26:38.740 --> 26:42.020]  You wanna talk about seeing some police chases, dude?
[26:42.020 --> 26:44.300]  No, I grew up in Whitebread Land in suburbia
[26:44.300 --> 26:47.100]  and cops used to have the run of the place.
[26:47.100 --> 26:52.100]  And no one ever said, you know, if we can't do 55 there,
[26:53.020 --> 26:56.140]  why are you doing 80 without the lights and sirens?
[26:56.140 --> 26:56.980]  Yeah, you're gonna hit a kid just like I am.
[26:56.980 --> 27:00.620]  If you're on your way to stop a crime, like, okay.
[27:00.620 --> 27:03.420]  But if you're on your way to lunch or back to the office,
[27:03.420 --> 27:05.660]  like inappropriate and dangerous, right?
[27:05.660 --> 27:07.860]  Cause it is for me and you're not special.
[27:07.860 --> 27:09.300]  My kid plays in this neighborhood.
[27:09.300 --> 27:10.540]  You can't hit him, please.
[27:10.540 --> 27:12.820]  Enough people took those complaints public
[27:12.820 --> 27:15.540]  that a bunch of rules and laws got passed.
[27:15.540 --> 27:17.420]  And now cops can get in all kinds of trouble
[27:17.420 --> 27:19.860]  if they get caught flipping their lights on
[27:19.860 --> 27:24.260]  to jump red lights or speeding up and down the highway.
[27:24.260 --> 27:25.860]  You can even pull video on YouTube
[27:25.860 --> 27:27.660]  of cops pulling other cops over for speed
[27:27.660 --> 27:29.980]  and just roasting them for it.
[27:31.260 --> 27:35.940]  There's a weird duality with our thoughts and actions
[27:35.980 --> 27:38.220]  and kind of views on the police.
[27:38.220 --> 27:41.060]  On the one hand, we kind of embrace
[27:41.060 --> 27:43.780]  a fuck the police culture is sort of a community.
[27:43.780 --> 27:46.620]  It's a general societal feeling.
[27:46.620 --> 27:49.460]  And on the other hand, there are endless cop shows
[27:49.460 --> 27:51.980]  and there's the real follow the cops around
[27:51.980 --> 27:53.460]  while they stop criminals type,
[27:53.460 --> 27:55.700]  cops type shows that you're talking about.
[27:55.700 --> 27:58.580]  But there's also a thousand dramas
[27:58.580 --> 28:00.860]  where it's scripted television.
[28:00.860 --> 28:04.620]  It's not legit at all, but the lead characters are cops.
[28:04.620 --> 28:05.900]  They're following cops around.
[28:05.900 --> 28:10.420]  The whole plot is cops get bad guy justice served.
[28:10.420 --> 28:12.300]  That's always been one of the best genres.
[28:12.300 --> 28:13.260]  Hawaii Five-O.
[28:13.260 --> 28:16.540]  Literally millions of Americans watch cop shows
[28:16.540 --> 28:17.940]  and share and root for the cops.
[28:17.940 --> 28:21.740]  And the difference between the cops we interact with
[28:21.740 --> 28:24.660]  in the real world and the cops on TV
[28:24.660 --> 28:28.220]  is that nine times out of 10, the cops on TV,
[28:28.220 --> 28:31.780]  when one of the cops on TV goes, I'm gonna break the law,
[28:31.780 --> 28:34.500]  the other cops on TV go, no, you're not.
[28:35.380 --> 28:36.220]  That's a crime.
[28:36.220 --> 28:37.260]  You're getting in trouble too.
[28:37.260 --> 28:39.980]  And in reality, we see all the other cops go,
[28:39.980 --> 28:40.820]  then blue line.
[28:41.700 --> 28:45.820]  And I honestly think that's where the disconnect comes in
[28:45.820 --> 28:49.540]  is because we don't see enough accountability
[28:49.540 --> 28:51.580]  amongst those populations.
[28:51.580 --> 28:52.420]  Peer pressure.
[28:54.620 --> 28:56.500]  I don't know, this show took a weird turn.
[28:56.500 --> 28:58.540]  It did, but I like those weird turns.
[28:58.540 --> 28:59.540]  They like it when we ramble.
[28:59.540 --> 29:02.300]  I think the audience likes the weird turns.
[29:02.300 --> 29:04.140]  They like to come get stoned with us.
[29:05.100 --> 29:08.220]  I think cameras have had a lot of influence
[29:08.220 --> 29:11.260]  on law enforcement interaction on both sides.
[29:11.260 --> 29:14.900]  Sometimes I believe people are performing for the camera
[29:14.900 --> 29:16.860]  when interacting with law enforcement a little too much.
[29:16.860 --> 29:17.700]  We spoke earlier about that.
[29:17.700 --> 29:20.540]  The data on the first year or two of people,
[29:20.540 --> 29:22.700]  the departments putting the cameras in,
[29:22.700 --> 29:25.420]  complaints on both sides fell like 60 or 80%.
[29:25.420 --> 29:26.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[29:26.300 --> 29:27.180]  Well, I'm not just saying the people
[29:27.180 --> 29:28.380]  that those guys that sit in there,
[29:28.380 --> 29:30.180]  I know my rights, I'm not getting out of the car.
[29:30.180 --> 29:31.220]  So those are a little extreme.
[29:31.220 --> 29:33.140]  I'm thinking like some of the people
[29:33.140 --> 29:35.100]  that get a little ridiculous with the police,
[29:35.100 --> 29:37.620]  like physical and act like a fucking
[29:37.620 --> 29:38.780]  complete asshole on camera.
[29:38.780 --> 29:40.140]  I think some of those people are just showing off
[29:40.140 --> 29:41.860]  because we have too many cameras now.
[29:41.860 --> 29:43.340]  But also I think it does, like you said,
[29:43.340 --> 29:45.260]  it makes a lot of accountability, a lot.
[29:45.260 --> 29:47.900]  You can't go anywhere around here.
[29:47.900 --> 29:49.180]  You gotta go out to the sticks or somewhere
[29:49.180 --> 29:50.020]  to not be on camera.
[29:50.020 --> 29:51.460]  And then you're probably on a fucking trail cam
[29:51.460 --> 29:52.300]  also out there.
[29:52.300 --> 29:53.140]  Right.
[29:53.140 --> 29:53.980]  Yeah, there's cameras everywhere now.
[29:53.980 --> 29:56.100]  With the addition of the body cam
[29:56.100 --> 29:57.860]  for a lot of police departments
[29:57.860 --> 30:00.300]  has just drastically dropped the number of complaints
[30:00.300 --> 30:01.700]  on both sides.
[30:01.700 --> 30:02.860]  If you're not already on camera,
[30:03.580 --> 30:04.460]  Tony's probably flying a drone around,
[30:04.460 --> 30:05.300]  finding you with it.
[30:05.300 --> 30:06.140]  Right.
[30:06.140 --> 30:07.500]  If it's not a security camera,
[30:07.500 --> 30:10.980]  it's a drone or a private camera or a doorbell camera.
[30:12.300 --> 30:14.780]  I'm just waiting until we've all got one on our foreheads.
[30:14.780 --> 30:17.300]  Just scanning everything all day.
[30:17.300 --> 30:18.580]  Recording, recording.
[30:18.580 --> 30:20.260]  That's what Google Glasses was basically.
[30:20.260 --> 30:21.500]  It beeps before you walk into a pole.
[30:21.500 --> 30:23.300]  Just barely though, just barely.
[30:23.300 --> 30:25.260]  So we're all gonna be just human Teslas.
[30:25.260 --> 30:26.100]  Basically.
[30:26.100 --> 30:26.980]  Autopilot all day.
[30:26.980 --> 30:28.660]  We basically are with the phone in our hand.
[30:28.660 --> 30:30.660]  We're just on autopilot.
[30:30.660 --> 30:32.380]  Yeah, it's the phone's not new.
[30:32.900 --> 30:33.740]  It's just the new thing.
[30:33.740 --> 30:34.580]  Right.
[30:34.580 --> 30:36.420]  Before it was the phone, it was the paper.
[30:36.420 --> 30:37.260]  The newspaper?
[30:37.260 --> 30:38.100]  Yep.
[30:38.100 --> 30:38.940]  Yeah, I remember that.
[30:38.940 --> 30:42.060]  My grandpa had the newspaper to his face constantly.
[30:42.060 --> 30:42.900]  Yep.
[30:42.900 --> 30:43.740]  I think he was just holding it there
[30:43.740 --> 30:45.220]  so that nobody would talk to him.
[30:45.220 --> 30:47.140]  Couldn't take that long to read the fucking newspaper.
[30:47.140 --> 30:49.220]  It was a great way to tell everyone else in the room
[30:49.220 --> 30:50.060]  to shut the fuck up.
[30:50.060 --> 30:52.020]  It's like just this big three foot square
[30:52.020 --> 30:53.380]  of go fuck yourself.
[30:53.380 --> 30:55.620]  And the way you had to open it made a noise
[30:55.620 --> 30:56.740]  that told everyone around you,
[30:56.740 --> 30:58.700]  hey, shut the fuck up, I'm about to read.
[30:58.700 --> 31:01.460]  Yeah, and it creates this like little barrier around you.
[31:01.500 --> 31:02.340]  There's no eye contact.
[31:02.340 --> 31:03.420]  It looks just like the iPad,
[31:03.420 --> 31:05.100]  except it doesn't light up at you.
[31:05.100 --> 31:05.940]  Yep.
[31:05.940 --> 31:06.780]  Awesome.
[31:07.580 --> 31:09.540]  All right, Mike, we've got plenty of material
[31:09.540 --> 31:11.300]  to where even once I edit out the weird shit,
[31:11.300 --> 31:13.900]  we'll still have a quality podcast here.
[31:13.900 --> 31:16.140]  Let's make it better and let's take some dabs
[31:16.140 --> 31:17.540]  and see where the conversation goes.
[31:17.540 --> 31:21.540]  What was that random request I had for the listeners
[31:21.540 --> 31:24.460]  that I said I wanted to ask earlier now,
[31:24.460 --> 31:25.380]  I don't remember what it was.
[31:25.380 --> 31:26.220]  Oh, I totally don't remember.
[31:26.220 --> 31:27.820]  You're asking me to remember stuff
[31:27.820 --> 31:28.700]  and we've been taking dabs.
[31:28.700 --> 31:29.540]  I've had a really long day.
[31:29.660 --> 31:31.380]  Between dabs one and two.
[31:34.740 --> 31:37.140]  See, now you're creating more editing, but that's okay.
[31:37.140 --> 31:38.660]  I don't remember.
[31:38.660 --> 31:40.380]  Let's take some dabs of the,
[31:41.460 --> 31:42.420]  well, let's hit the fluffernutter.
[31:42.420 --> 31:43.460]  I think it's right in front of me.
[31:43.460 --> 31:44.300]  I can reach it.
[31:44.300 --> 31:45.140]  Do it.
[31:45.140 --> 31:46.140]  This stuff is tasty, I really like it.
[31:46.140 --> 31:50.420]  The container says it is 74.62% THC.
[31:51.540 --> 31:53.860]  All right, Mike, I just heated up this nail way too hot.
[31:53.860 --> 31:54.700]  So I'm gonna let it cool
[31:54.700 --> 31:59.260]  and then I'm gonna hit this fluffernutter from Contraband.
[31:59.260 --> 32:00.100]  Yeah.
[32:01.860 --> 32:03.260]  I'm trying to think how to describe the flavor.
[32:03.260 --> 32:08.180]  It's sweet, it's sharp, it's a candy dryer sheets.
[32:08.180 --> 32:09.300]  I remember the question.
[32:09.300 --> 32:10.300]  Let's hear your question, Mike.
[32:10.300 --> 32:11.140]  All right, let's do this.
[32:11.140 --> 32:12.460]  I'm gonna dab.
[32:12.460 --> 32:15.940]  So the terminology that I've always heard
[32:15.940 --> 32:18.860]  for the leftover smoke in a bong hit,
[32:18.860 --> 32:22.060]  so you go to take a bong hit, you don't click clear it,
[32:22.060 --> 32:26.500]  that leftover smoke is referred to as a buffalo fart.
[32:26.500 --> 32:28.980]  I'm sure this has regional variations,
[32:28.980 --> 32:30.380]  which I would love to hear.
[32:30.420 --> 32:32.940]  So tweet me at at Nemopunk15.
[32:32.940 --> 32:35.540]  The question is, is A,
[32:35.540 --> 32:38.300]  what do you call the leftover bong smoke in your area?
[32:38.300 --> 32:41.220]  And B, is there a different term
[32:41.220 --> 32:43.300]  for leftover vapor in a dab rig?
[32:44.540 --> 32:46.380]  That is the question.
[32:46.380 --> 32:48.060]  Please tweet answers.
[32:48.060 --> 32:49.660]  When we originally talked about this earlier,
[32:49.660 --> 32:51.340]  I didn't remember the term that we used.
[32:51.340 --> 32:52.820]  It just came to me as I was dabbing.
[32:52.820 --> 32:55.100]  See, people say that dabbing might be bad for your memory.
[32:55.100 --> 32:56.700]  No, it brought shit back.
[32:58.180 --> 32:59.020]  What was I gonna say?
[32:59.020 --> 32:59.860]  No, I'm just kidding.
[33:00.380 --> 33:01.220]  What do you call that?
[33:01.220 --> 33:02.060]  Rebong.
[33:02.060 --> 33:02.900]  The smoke that was-
[33:02.900 --> 33:03.740]  The rebong?
[33:03.740 --> 33:04.580]  Rebong.
[33:04.580 --> 33:05.420]  The smoke that's left in the bong is rebong.
[33:05.420 --> 33:06.780]  And then my buddy Josh would grab it
[33:06.780 --> 33:09.620]  and blow into the downstem to blow air into it
[33:09.620 --> 33:10.460]  to get that smoke out.
[33:10.460 --> 33:12.780]  That's the only way to safely clear a buffalo fart.
[33:12.780 --> 33:13.940]  And then one day I told him, I said,
[33:13.940 --> 33:17.260]  bro, I think I'd rather have rebong than rebreath.
[33:17.260 --> 33:19.060]  And we all thought about that for a couple of minutes
[33:19.060 --> 33:20.660]  and I was like, I think I'm just gonna blow it out myself
[33:20.660 --> 33:22.500]  every time now instead of letting you blow it out
[33:22.500 --> 33:24.780]  or somebody else blow out the rebong for me.
[33:24.780 --> 33:27.300]  So rebong, from where I'm from,
[33:27.300 --> 33:28.940]  buffalo fart is where Mike is from.
[33:28.980 --> 33:31.780]  What do you call that stale smoke left in the bong?
[33:31.780 --> 33:33.460]  Also, how do you get that shit out of there?
[33:33.460 --> 33:34.580]  What is your approach?
[33:34.580 --> 33:36.420]  You gotta blow through the downstem,
[33:36.420 --> 33:38.940]  otherwise you end up with a lung full of stale smoke
[33:38.940 --> 33:40.420]  and then you cough till you die.
[33:40.420 --> 33:41.860]  How do you feel about rebong then?
[33:41.860 --> 33:43.180]  Or how do you feel about relung?
[33:43.180 --> 33:46.060]  Well, you just, you blow through the downstem
[33:46.060 --> 33:48.020]  to clear the smoke, then you turn the bong around
[33:48.020 --> 33:50.380]  to hit it normal and refill it with normal air
[33:50.380 --> 33:51.820]  before you pass it along.
[33:51.820 --> 33:53.940]  Don't be a fucking savage.
[33:53.940 --> 33:55.820]  Don't be a caveman about it.
[33:55.820 --> 33:57.540]  When you're raised in a frat house,
[33:57.540 --> 33:58.700]  clear your buffalo fart.
[33:59.500 --> 34:01.180]  That's the first question there.
[34:01.180 --> 34:05.020]  What do we call a buffalo fart or rebong where you're from?
[34:05.020 --> 34:09.540]  Then question number two or part B or addendum A,
[34:10.700 --> 34:13.700]  we'll be, Mike made a really good face at addendum A.
[34:13.700 --> 34:15.100]  That was good.
[34:15.100 --> 34:17.940]  What do you call the smoke that is left in the rig
[34:17.940 --> 34:20.100]  after you take a big dab and you can't clear it
[34:20.100 --> 34:21.380]  and you just give up and you set it down
[34:21.380 --> 34:22.540]  and there's a little smoke sitting in there
[34:22.540 --> 34:23.780]  like mine's got going on right now
[34:23.780 --> 34:25.900]  because I don't want to cough too much on the podcast.
[34:25.900 --> 34:28.620]  What do you call that stale bong, rebong
[34:28.620 --> 34:31.060]  or dab buffalo fart?
[34:31.060 --> 34:32.300]  What do you call that?
[34:32.300 --> 34:33.340]  This is the question.
[34:33.340 --> 34:36.620]  Tweet Mike at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[34:36.620 --> 34:39.100]  Good answers on Twitter will get liked.
[34:39.100 --> 34:40.180]  Ooh, there you go.
[34:40.180 --> 34:41.580]  You'll get liked.
[34:41.580 --> 34:43.180]  Will you maybe follow them back?
[34:43.180 --> 34:44.020]  Unlikely.
[34:44.020 --> 34:45.100]  Unlikely, okay.
[34:45.100 --> 34:46.740]  And also tweet me, include me, please.
[34:46.740 --> 34:47.580]  Why not?
[34:47.580 --> 34:50.100]  At RastaJeff420 or if you really want to get fancy,
[34:50.100 --> 34:53.780]  include the podcast at GFYHpodcast on the Twitter.
[34:53.780 --> 34:56.020]  Exceptional answers might get retweeted.
[34:56.020 --> 34:57.180]  I will retweet some shit.
[34:57.180 --> 34:58.300]  I'm all about a good retweet.
[34:58.300 --> 34:59.180]  It's just one button.
[34:59.180 --> 35:02.140]  I used to get wild and start promising ludicrous things.
[35:02.140 --> 35:06.500]  I'm a stick with the ludicrous or unludicrous things.
[35:06.500 --> 35:08.180]  So by sticking with ludicrous things
[35:08.180 --> 35:10.620]  means you're going to make huge promises and under deliver.
[35:10.620 --> 35:11.460]  Yep.
[35:11.460 --> 35:12.300]  That seems to be a ludicrous thing.
[35:12.300 --> 35:13.300]  Hashtag fire fest.
[35:13.300 --> 35:14.140]  Oh.
[35:17.420 --> 35:21.020]  I was looking for my brain sort of resin clogged on
[35:21.020 --> 35:23.220]  like there's underwhelmed and overwhelmed
[35:23.220 --> 35:24.660]  but there isn't a whelmed.
[35:24.660 --> 35:27.140]  And I said ludicrous and my brain went like,
[35:27.140 --> 35:28.300]  Chris isn't a word.
[35:29.620 --> 35:31.700]  It just kind of froze there for a second.
[35:31.700 --> 35:32.540]  Wow.
[35:32.540 --> 35:33.380]  Yeah.
[35:33.380 --> 35:34.820]  Dabs don't open up pathways to everybody.
[35:34.820 --> 35:36.100]  Sometimes they clog them.
[35:36.100 --> 35:37.500]  I had something else I was going to say.
[35:37.500 --> 35:39.180]  Oh, I was going to say retweets,
[35:39.180 --> 35:42.340]  a lot like flushing your plants are absolutely free.
[35:42.340 --> 35:43.180]  Yep.
[35:43.180 --> 35:44.100]  People should do more of both.
[35:44.100 --> 35:44.940]  Yep.
[35:44.940 --> 35:45.780]  All right.
[35:45.780 --> 35:46.620]  Mike, you want a dab?
[35:46.620 --> 35:48.260]  I would love a dib.
[35:48.260 --> 35:49.100]  A dib.
[35:49.100 --> 35:49.940]  Come on, bro.
[35:49.940 --> 35:50.780]  Like half grams are better.
[35:50.780 --> 35:53.740]  I almost need you to get a smaller dab tool.
[35:54.980 --> 35:56.180]  You want me to baby burn it, bro?
[35:56.180 --> 35:57.820]  You want me to fucking drop a dab on the nail
[35:57.820 --> 35:59.500]  and smoke most of it and then let you have what's left?
[35:59.500 --> 36:01.500]  You did pretty good with the last size dab.
[36:01.500 --> 36:04.900]  It's just this snow shovel contraption you're using is,
[36:04.900 --> 36:06.700]  it's hard to get the small dab on there.
[36:06.700 --> 36:08.300]  Shout out to our friends at Happy Daddy
[36:08.300 --> 36:11.060]  for the Globfather 2 dabber here.
[36:11.060 --> 36:13.060]  It's hard to get a teaspoon of tobacco.
[36:13.060 --> 36:15.700]  There's, what'd you call her?
[36:15.700 --> 36:17.140]  You heard me.
[36:17.140 --> 36:18.340]  There's a little dab for you.
[36:18.340 --> 36:19.180]  Mike.
[36:19.180 --> 36:20.020]  That was perfect.
[36:20.060 --> 36:21.820]  Mike, consumer, we've talked about this.
[36:21.820 --> 36:22.900]  So when he hits this dab,
[36:22.900 --> 36:25.140]  I'll have to turn off his mic for three to seven minutes.
[36:25.140 --> 36:27.900]  And then I'm going to be chatting all by myself here.
[36:27.900 --> 36:29.100]  So Mike, while I heat this up,
[36:29.100 --> 36:30.700]  I'll turn down my microphone.
[36:30.700 --> 36:32.780]  Why don't you tell people about your Facebook page
[36:32.780 --> 36:35.020]  and about your Twitter and throw out some plugs
[36:35.020 --> 36:36.300]  while I heat up a nail?
[36:36.300 --> 36:37.780]  Ah, folks looking for more of me,
[36:37.780 --> 36:40.180]  you can find me at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws
[36:40.180 --> 36:43.540]  on Facebook or at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[36:44.980 --> 36:47.140]  Everybody that hears me on the show,
[36:47.140 --> 36:48.420]  follows me on Instagram.
[36:48.460 --> 36:52.180]  It's at Nemopunk15 on Instagram as well,
[36:52.180 --> 36:56.380]  but I almost never post like seven posts in five years guys.
[36:57.820 --> 37:00.700]  But yeah, you can follow me on all of those social medias.
[37:02.060 --> 37:03.660]  Other plugs, I have none.
[37:03.660 --> 37:05.260]  Read more news.
[37:05.260 --> 37:07.980]  Have more pro cannabis conversations
[37:07.980 --> 37:09.140]  with your family members.
[37:09.140 --> 37:09.980]  There you go.
[37:09.980 --> 37:11.540]  That's how I'm out of the cannabis closet
[37:11.540 --> 37:15.100]  to everybody but your boss with the good health insurance.
[37:15.100 --> 37:16.420]  Come out of the cannabis closet
[37:16.460 --> 37:18.500]  and then hang some lights in that closet.
[37:18.500 --> 37:20.060]  Yeah, once you're out of the closet,
[37:20.060 --> 37:22.980]  there's room for lights and a fan.
[37:22.980 --> 37:24.740]  Yeah, ventilation is key in there.
[37:26.060 --> 37:27.300]  All right, that's really hot.
[37:27.300 --> 37:29.180]  I was just trying to clean it up for you a little bit.
[37:29.180 --> 37:31.220]  Which is silly because I'm just gonna dirty it all up.
[37:31.220 --> 37:32.460]  Well, then we'll hit it with a Q-tip
[37:32.460 --> 37:33.460]  and clean it back up again.
[37:33.460 --> 37:34.340]  That nail is brand new.
[37:34.340 --> 37:35.180]  I bought that today.
[37:35.180 --> 37:36.620]  Shout out to our friends at Elevate Glass
[37:36.620 --> 37:37.500]  in Colorado Springs.
[37:37.500 --> 37:40.460]  Beautiful Elevate Glass at 517 South Tate Home.
[37:40.460 --> 37:42.500]  Almost had the address right in my head.
[37:42.500 --> 37:43.420]  I saw you thinking there.
[37:43.420 --> 37:44.900]  Make sure you support our friends at Elevate Glass.
[37:44.900 --> 37:47.860]  Drop in, tell Jen and Becca that Rasta Jeff sent you.
[37:47.860 --> 37:48.700]  They'll take good care of you.
[37:48.700 --> 37:49.540]  They'll take good care of you
[37:49.540 --> 37:50.380]  even if you don't mention me.
[37:50.380 --> 37:53.540]  But you know, you get that Rasta Jeff love in there.
[37:54.380 --> 37:56.260]  All right, Mike, you're about to take a dab.
[37:56.260 --> 37:58.020]  You're about to start coughing.
[37:58.020 --> 37:58.860]  Are you done?
[37:58.860 --> 37:59.700]  Have a good night, everybody.
[37:59.700 --> 38:00.540]  Yeah, that's what I was about to say.
[38:00.540 --> 38:01.380]  I think it's time to wrap up the podcast.
[38:01.380 --> 38:04.420]  I'm gonna cough my way through the outro.
[38:04.420 --> 38:05.260]  I'm gonna turn him down to.
[38:05.260 --> 38:06.300]  Have a good night, everybody.
[38:06.300 --> 38:07.980]  It was a beautiful show.
[38:07.980 --> 38:09.420]  Tweet me, talk to you later.
[38:09.420 --> 38:10.260]  There you go.
[38:10.260 --> 38:11.100]  He's gonna take a dab.
[38:11.100 --> 38:12.260]  He's already taken off the headphones.
[38:12.260 --> 38:13.740]  So Mike is done.
[38:13.740 --> 38:14.620]  He's clocked out.
[38:15.340 --> 38:16.260]  His mic is way turned down.
[38:16.260 --> 38:17.220]  Hey, Mike, thanks for coming.
[38:17.220 --> 38:19.100]  I wanna thank everybody for listening to the podcast.
[38:19.100 --> 38:20.060]  Thanks for hanging out.
[38:20.060 --> 38:21.740]  Again, thank you for listening to the Grow series.
