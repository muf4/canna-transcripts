[00:01.080 --> 00:19.320]  All right, here we go.
[00:19.320 --> 00:20.920]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:20.920 --> 00:21.920]  I'm your host.
[00:21.920 --> 00:23.520]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:23.520 --> 00:28.480]  This is episode 769 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:28.480 --> 00:32.200]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about selecting nutrients for your grow.
[00:32.200 --> 00:35.500]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout-outs to a few of those great
[00:35.500 --> 00:39.560]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:39.560 --> 00:43.620]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout-out to OG Roach
[00:43.620 --> 00:44.960]  and the Devil's Weed.
[00:44.960 --> 00:47.920]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout-out to Justus Smokin.
[00:47.920 --> 00:50.800]  I want to send a big thank you to Nomi by my guacamole.
[00:50.800 --> 00:54.140]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout-out to Kojax and Kes Burton.
[00:54.140 --> 00:57.040]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to my buddy ADHD Grower.
[00:57.040 --> 00:59.200]  Let's send a special thank you to Growman Stan.
[00:59.200 --> 01:02.300]  I want to send a thank you to StashDrop269.
[01:02.300 --> 01:04.360]  Let's send a fist bump to Dreadlock Farmer.
[01:04.360 --> 01:08.200]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout-out
[01:08.320 --> 01:10.000]  to Ars Kikersen.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.840]  Big thanks and big shout-out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:14.840 --> 01:18.240]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:18.240 --> 01:24.580]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:24.580 --> 01:27.840]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen and you know I do include
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.960]  a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all
[01:31.960 --> 01:35.320]  of my friends to support the podcast.
[01:35.320 --> 01:39.200]  Speaking of supporting the podcast, I am seeking questions for an upcoming episode.
[01:39.200 --> 01:43.640]  That's right, I'm going to do an episode where I eat too many edibles and I answer questions
[01:43.640 --> 01:45.960]  that are non-Grow related.
[01:45.960 --> 01:49.360]  That's right, I don't try to abandon the Grow questions on Patreon, but I'm going to do
[01:49.360 --> 01:51.080]  a Patreon only episode.
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.400]  I'm going to eat too many edibles and I want to answer questions mainly kind of about me,
[01:55.400 --> 01:56.400]  about my company.
[01:56.400 --> 02:00.000]  Anything you want to ask me that is not Grow related, this is a good time to ask that.
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.900]  So if you've got a question, now's a good time to join the Patreon, send those questions
[02:03.940 --> 02:08.380]  to the Patreon campaign and I will work those in to the upcoming edible episodes where I
[02:08.380 --> 02:11.540]  do eat too many edibles and answer personal questions.
[02:11.540 --> 02:12.780]  That's kind of the idea that I'm going for.
[02:12.780 --> 02:16.660]  It could be personal questions, it could be questions about dreadlocks, it could be questions
[02:16.660 --> 02:20.400]  about shoes, you know that I'm into sneakers, it could be questions about music.
[02:20.400 --> 02:24.340]  Anything you want to know that is not cannabis related, this is the format for those questions.
[02:24.340 --> 02:28.140]  So please do join the Patreon and send me those questions on Patreon because I'm going
[02:28.140 --> 02:30.420]  through the Patreon to do the episode.
[02:30.420 --> 02:31.860]  That is where I'll get the questions from.
[02:31.860 --> 02:33.140]  I look forward to that.
[02:33.140 --> 02:37.420]  I am also looking forward to my greenhouse filled with seeds being harvested here within
[02:37.420 --> 02:39.020]  the next couple of weeks.
[02:39.020 --> 02:43.220]  I was in the greenhouse today looking around and the seeds are coming along quite nicely.
[02:43.220 --> 02:44.500]  The seeds are getting hard.
[02:44.500 --> 02:47.620]  If you have not been paying attention, I do have a greenhouse somewhere that I will not
[02:47.620 --> 02:48.860]  tell you where it is.
[02:48.860 --> 02:51.240]  In that greenhouse, I've done a little bit of breeding.
[02:51.240 --> 02:56.220]  We took a Jack the Ripper male and put that Jack the Ripper male to 10 solid female plants.
[02:56.220 --> 03:00.100]  So there will be 10 Jack the Ripper crosses, some of which you are familiar, some of which
[03:00.100 --> 03:01.880]  will be brand new.
[03:02.880 --> 03:06.360]  There will be a platinum tangy pollinated by the Jack the Ripper.
[03:06.360 --> 03:12.600]  There might be an LA Cush and we may be making more blueberry butcher out there in the outdoor
[03:12.600 --> 03:13.600]  run.
[03:13.600 --> 03:14.600]  Can't say too much more.
[03:14.600 --> 03:16.320]  I've already said enough, but I am getting excited.
[03:16.320 --> 03:17.400]  The plants are looking good.
[03:17.400 --> 03:19.020]  The buds are swollen.
[03:19.020 --> 03:20.080]  The seeds are getting fat.
[03:20.080 --> 03:21.080]  They're getting hard.
[03:21.080 --> 03:23.240]  We keep pulling seeds out every couple of days and giving them a squeeze.
[03:23.240 --> 03:24.600]  They are getting close.
[03:24.600 --> 03:27.680]  Within the next two weeks, maybe three weeks at the most, those will come down.
[03:27.680 --> 03:32.320]  It will take me a while to get those processed, packaged, and out to you, but I will be sending
[03:32.320 --> 03:33.320]  out test seeds.
[03:33.320 --> 03:35.600]  I will be sending out a lot of new stuff very soon.
[03:35.600 --> 03:38.760]  A lot of new great stuff coming up for 2022.
[03:38.760 --> 03:42.520]  I wanted to brag, tell you how excited I am about that greenhouse coming along.
[03:42.520 --> 03:43.520]  I cannot wait.
[03:43.520 --> 03:46.000]  You may hear that I got some greenhouse dust in the nose.
[03:46.000 --> 03:47.400]  I feel like I got some allergies.
[03:47.400 --> 03:48.400]  I'm not sick.
[03:48.400 --> 03:49.760]  It's not the vid again, but I do have some.
[03:49.760 --> 03:53.720]  If you do hear it, that's just some outdoor dirt and dust from being outside too much
[03:53.720 --> 03:54.720]  today.
[03:54.720 --> 03:55.720]  That's all that's from.
[03:55.720 --> 03:56.720]  Excuse me for that.
[03:56.760 --> 03:59.160]  Talking about outdoor grows, I want to give a big shout out to a friend.
[03:59.160 --> 04:00.160]  I'm not going to say his name.
[04:00.160 --> 04:04.000]  A friend of mine got his plants stolen from his outdoor grow.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.040]  If you've ever heard me talk about outdoor growing, I do always say plant a few extra.
[04:08.040 --> 04:11.320]  You've got to plant one for the thieves, one for the bugs, one for the animals, one for
[04:11.320 --> 04:14.000]  the weather, then maybe plant a couple for yourself.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.560]  Hopefully, you will get one or two of those at the end.
[04:16.560 --> 04:20.760]  If you got your plants, your outdoor plants were stolen this year, I do send you love.
[04:20.760 --> 04:22.800]  I do have, what is it, condolences for you.
[04:22.800 --> 04:24.920]  I do have love and empathy for that.
[04:24.920 --> 04:26.340]  Maybe some sympathy.
[04:26.340 --> 04:27.860]  Be careful where you're planting your plants.
[04:27.860 --> 04:29.220]  You guys don't tell anybody.
[04:29.220 --> 04:34.300]  Chances are it's an inside job and your plants do get stolen or you did not do enough security
[04:34.300 --> 04:35.300]  work.
[04:35.300 --> 04:37.460]  It's usually the plants right there at the corners near the edge of the fence.
[04:37.460 --> 04:38.580]  Those go first.
[04:38.580 --> 04:39.860]  Maybe don't plant right there.
[04:39.860 --> 04:43.620]  Maybe be more discreet, but be prepared if you're growing outdoors, that shit is going
[04:43.620 --> 04:45.540]  to potentially get stolen.
[04:45.540 --> 04:48.500]  Do you have a strategy that you're going to follow if somebody does come to take your
[04:48.500 --> 04:49.500]  plants?
[04:49.500 --> 04:52.860]  It's not up to me to tell you what to do, but keep in mind that you can grow more plants
[04:52.860 --> 04:54.940]  next year if you are not in jail.
[04:54.940 --> 04:57.740]  Whatever you're going to do, be very careful protecting your garden.
[04:57.740 --> 05:00.300]  But now is the time people are out stealing plants.
[05:00.300 --> 05:01.300]  The buds are getting big.
[05:01.300 --> 05:02.300]  The plants look ready.
[05:02.300 --> 05:05.460]  The people that don't know they're not ready are going to start stealing shit.
[05:05.460 --> 05:08.340]  Over the next couple of few weeks, plants will be getting stolen.
[05:08.340 --> 05:09.340]  Be ready for that.
[05:09.340 --> 05:10.460]  I don't want you to get your plants taken.
[05:10.460 --> 05:12.780]  Bro, if your plants got stolen, you know who you are.
[05:12.780 --> 05:13.780]  Shout out.
[05:13.780 --> 05:14.780]  Fist bump, bro.
[05:14.780 --> 05:16.500]  I wish I could give you a fat plant to replace that or something.
[05:16.500 --> 05:19.740]  Nothing I could do for you except send you some love and a fist bump.
[05:19.740 --> 05:22.700]  Better luck next year.
[05:22.700 --> 05:26.020]  The last order of business that I wanted to ramble about is something kind of silly, just
[05:26.020 --> 05:27.020]  kind of personal.
[05:27.020 --> 05:31.660]  I think I've discovered over the past couple of weekends that cleaning cloners is probably
[05:31.660 --> 05:34.500]  my least favorite task when it comes to growing cannabis.
[05:34.500 --> 05:35.660]  I love growing.
[05:35.660 --> 05:37.060]  I love transplanting.
[05:37.060 --> 05:40.780]  I love doing all of the work that comes with defoliation, popping, twisting, putting up
[05:40.780 --> 05:41.900]  the nets.
[05:41.900 --> 05:43.140]  Cleaning the rooms is even fun.
[05:43.140 --> 05:44.900]  Doing all the reset, all that work is fun.
[05:44.900 --> 05:46.380]  Even packaging seeds is fun.
[05:46.380 --> 05:48.100]  I do not like cleaning cloners.
[05:48.100 --> 05:52.780]  I use the Easy Cloner clone machines and for some reason just cleaning those is one of
[05:52.780 --> 05:55.180]  my least favorite tasks.
[05:55.180 --> 05:57.580]  Let me know what your least favorite garden tasks are.
[05:57.580 --> 05:58.580]  Send me an email.
[05:58.580 --> 05:59.580]  Send me a tweet.
[05:59.580 --> 06:00.580]  Let me know.
[06:00.580 --> 06:01.580]  We will talk about that on the show here in the future.
[06:01.580 --> 06:04.000]  If you want to tweet me, it's at GFYH podcast.
[06:04.000 --> 06:07.340]  If you want to send an email, it is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[06:07.340 --> 06:10.860]  Let me know what are your least favorite garden tasks.
[06:10.860 --> 06:13.100]  Maybe we could find some way to make those more fun, make them better.
[06:13.100 --> 06:16.860]  Of course, it's always better when you got the Grow From Your Heart podcast rambling
[06:16.860 --> 06:18.300]  in your ear.
[06:18.300 --> 06:19.300]  Enough rambling.
[06:19.300 --> 06:24.100]  I did say that I was going to read a message about selecting nutrients here in this episode.
[06:24.100 --> 06:26.820]  This message came from our friend Shotgun Yoda on Patreon.
[06:26.820 --> 06:28.400]  Big shout out to Shotgun Yoda.
[06:28.400 --> 06:32.180]  The message goes a little bit like this.
[06:32.180 --> 06:36.100]  How about an episode on how to pick the correct nutrient line?
[06:36.100 --> 06:39.500]  What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
[06:39.500 --> 06:41.640]  That is a really good question.
[06:41.640 --> 06:43.220]  This could be a really in-depth episode.
[06:43.220 --> 06:46.720]  I'm going to try to cover this kind of tight, but you know how I get.
[06:47.580 --> 06:49.320]  Let's get right into it.
[06:49.320 --> 06:52.360]  There are a few things to think about when it comes to selecting nutrients.
[06:52.360 --> 06:55.680]  The most important maybe is availability.
[06:55.680 --> 06:56.680]  Is it available?
[06:56.680 --> 06:57.680]  Can you get it?
[06:57.680 --> 06:58.680]  Where can you get it?
[06:58.680 --> 06:59.720]  Can you get it sustainably?
[06:59.720 --> 07:01.920]  Is it a one-time thing or is it readily available?
[07:01.920 --> 07:03.900]  Do you have to order it online?
[07:03.900 --> 07:05.480]  Is it an Amazon purchase?
[07:05.480 --> 07:09.760]  Is it a purchase directly from the company or is it available at your local grow store?
[07:09.760 --> 07:11.420]  Which of those mean the most to you?
[07:11.420 --> 07:12.600]  Is it available?
[07:12.600 --> 07:13.960]  That's what's going to matter the most.
[07:13.960 --> 07:15.600]  Can you get it?
[07:15.600 --> 07:20.400]  If you pick a line, if you research a line and it's not even available, you can't use
[07:20.400 --> 07:21.520]  it, what's it going to do for you?
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.000]  The most important part is, is that product, is that line available?
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.040]  Then one of the next things to think about, this may be important for more people than
[07:29.040 --> 07:30.540]  others, but the cost.
[07:30.540 --> 07:33.280]  Is this product, is this line cost effective?
[07:33.280 --> 07:37.880]  You're going to have to feed the plants for nine weeks of flour, a few weeks of veg.
[07:37.880 --> 07:39.400]  Is it going to be cost effective?
[07:39.400 --> 07:42.360]  Is your return on your investment going to be worth it?
[07:42.360 --> 07:44.360]  Sometimes some bottles are super expensive.
[07:44.640 --> 07:46.520]  Sometimes some bottles are really affordable.
[07:46.520 --> 07:47.560]  You've got to do the math.
[07:47.560 --> 07:49.560]  Think about, I'm buying a gallon.
[07:49.560 --> 07:51.960]  I need to use one ounce every time I water.
[07:51.960 --> 07:53.920]  How many waterings do you get per bottle?
[07:53.920 --> 07:55.880]  How many times per week do you water?
[07:55.880 --> 07:59.400]  How much product do you expect out of that product at the end, out of the end of the
[07:59.400 --> 08:00.400]  harvest?
[08:00.400 --> 08:02.040]  Do the math on that with each bottle.
[08:02.040 --> 08:06.240]  Then you've also got to factor in electricity, the water that you use.
[08:06.240 --> 08:08.560]  You've got to put in your time, your labor, all of that stuff.
[08:08.560 --> 08:09.940]  You've got to pay for trimmers.
[08:09.940 --> 08:11.520]  You've got to pay for scissors.
[08:11.520 --> 08:14.520]  Factor in all of that stuff, but think about the cost of the nutrients.
[08:14.520 --> 08:16.200]  Are they cost effective?
[08:16.200 --> 08:18.360]  Some brands out there are really expensive.
[08:18.360 --> 08:21.240]  Some brands out there are really affordable.
[08:21.240 --> 08:22.920]  Sometimes you get what you pay for.
[08:22.920 --> 08:27.760]  Sometimes you are paying for advertising, colorful bottles, fancy labels, expensive
[08:27.760 --> 08:29.240]  advertising.
[08:29.240 --> 08:31.320]  Sometimes you're not really paying for what you're getting.
[08:31.320 --> 08:33.640]  Think about that when it comes to buying your products.
[08:33.640 --> 08:35.000]  Research the brand.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.120]  Research the products you were thinking about buying.
[08:37.120 --> 08:39.120]  Research the brand that makes those products.
[08:39.120 --> 08:42.320]  Then research the other products that they make and see where they get their products
[08:42.320 --> 08:43.320]  from.
[08:43.320 --> 08:46.120]  See where they're sourcing their ingredients to make your products.
[08:46.120 --> 08:47.720]  Some companies have great ethics.
[08:47.720 --> 08:48.720]  Some do not.
[08:48.720 --> 08:51.760]  Think about if you want to support companies like Monsanto or Scott's.
[08:51.760 --> 08:52.760]  That is up to you.
[08:52.760 --> 08:53.760]  You can vote with your dollars.
[08:53.760 --> 08:55.400]  You can spend your money wherever you would like.
[08:55.400 --> 08:58.760]  It's none of my business, but it is something that you may want to think about.
[08:58.760 --> 09:00.680]  You may want to be aware of.
[09:00.680 --> 09:01.680]  Cost is very important.
[09:01.680 --> 09:03.100]  Here's something you may not have thought about.
[09:03.100 --> 09:04.980]  How about sustainability?
[09:04.980 --> 09:09.780]  Are the products you are purchasing or thinking about purchasing causing problems to the world
[09:09.780 --> 09:14.300]  or is that company doing something to prevent damage to our earth and our world?
[09:14.300 --> 09:15.300]  We only get one world.
[09:15.300 --> 09:16.540]  We only get one earth.
[09:16.540 --> 09:17.780]  It's up to us to not destroy it.
[09:17.780 --> 09:21.420]  I know that's my big hippie talk for the day, but are the nutrients and the products you're
[09:21.420 --> 09:24.340]  buying for your grow, are they sustainable?
[09:24.340 --> 09:25.600]  Is that going to destroy the earth?
[09:25.600 --> 09:29.020]  Is this a product that we can continue to buy and use for several years?
[09:29.020 --> 09:30.020]  Is this a product?
[09:30.020 --> 09:33.260]  Is this a brand that just appeared yesterday and may disappear tomorrow?
[09:33.260 --> 09:36.380]  I prefer to buy a brand that's been around for a minute and that I know is going to be
[09:36.380 --> 09:40.740]  around so that if I do fall in love with their products, I can get it forever.
[09:40.740 --> 09:42.660]  That's another part of sustainability.
[09:42.660 --> 09:46.580]  First we've got environmental sustainability, then we've got company sustainability.
[09:46.580 --> 09:49.300]  Are these products going to be around in a few years?
[09:49.300 --> 09:52.940]  If you grow the best herb you've ever grown and then that product's not available next
[09:52.940 --> 09:54.500]  year, you're going to be frustrated.
[09:54.500 --> 09:56.420]  Is it going to be available?
[09:56.420 --> 09:59.140]  The next thing I'm going to talk about is compatibility.
[09:59.140 --> 10:04.100]  Are the nutrients you are thinking about purchasing compatible with your grow style?
[10:04.100 --> 10:07.700]  Maybe you're growing hydroponic, maybe you're growing cocoa, maybe you're growing evanflo,
[10:07.700 --> 10:10.540]  maybe you're doing a living soil mix, maybe not.
[10:10.540 --> 10:14.900]  Maybe you're doing a soilless mix, maybe you're just growing an old dirt you found in the
[10:14.900 --> 10:16.060]  backyard.
[10:16.060 --> 10:19.060]  Are these nutrients compatible with your grow style?
[10:19.060 --> 10:23.260]  Also another thing to think about, are these nutrients compatible with each other?
[10:23.260 --> 10:25.660]  That's something we're going to talk about later in the episode.
[10:25.660 --> 10:30.860]  I prefer if a new grower is selecting nutrients, you pick one brand and get what you need from
[10:30.860 --> 10:31.860]  that line.
[10:31.860 --> 10:36.020]  I don't recommend that you go get a base from one company, a bloom booster from another,
[10:36.020 --> 10:41.140]  a root tonic from another, a phosphorus thing from another, because those companies didn't
[10:41.140 --> 10:44.620]  talk to each other and you may run the risk of overlapping nutrients.
[10:44.620 --> 10:45.980]  We're going to talk more about that in the future.
[10:45.980 --> 10:47.660]  I think I've got that written down.
[10:47.660 --> 10:50.660]  The next thing that really matters is results.
[10:50.660 --> 10:54.740]  When you grew with these nutrients, were you satisfied with the outcome of your product?
[10:54.740 --> 10:57.540]  How does your bud look, smell, taste, burn, smoke?
[10:57.540 --> 11:00.940]  Give me the buzz that you were hoping for, that you spent all these weeks and all these
[11:00.940 --> 11:02.260]  nutrients pouring into it.
[11:02.260 --> 11:03.500]  Did it work for you?
[11:03.500 --> 11:07.340]  A lot of things you're going to notice from the nutrients are flavor, aroma, and color.
[11:07.340 --> 11:10.260]  That's going to be the first three things I notice, flavor, aroma, and color.
[11:10.260 --> 11:12.780]  You can see during the grow if you're getting good colors.
[11:12.780 --> 11:15.300]  You can see if you're getting big fat buds or little puny buds.
[11:15.300 --> 11:16.300]  You can see that.
[11:16.300 --> 11:18.260]  Then what about flavor and aroma?
[11:18.260 --> 11:19.780]  Smell those plants, smell those buds.
[11:19.780 --> 11:21.300]  Do they smell good?
[11:21.300 --> 11:22.660]  One thing, I used another company.
[11:22.660 --> 11:24.700]  I'm going to try to avoid bashing companies here.
[11:24.700 --> 11:27.220]  I used to use a company when I was brand new.
[11:27.220 --> 11:29.380]  They sell you about 30 bottles.
[11:29.380 --> 11:31.020]  They mix shit up like a science lab.
[11:31.020 --> 11:33.740]  All their bottles have real fancy packaging.
[11:33.740 --> 11:34.980]  The labels are really cool.
[11:34.980 --> 11:37.940]  Every label is well thought out, really good advertising.
[11:37.940 --> 11:39.500]  You see them in every magazine.
[11:39.500 --> 11:41.140]  I got big fat buds.
[11:41.140 --> 11:42.140]  Trust me.
[11:42.140 --> 11:46.780]  Everything was big and fat and huge and dense and smoked well, but it all tasted exactly
[11:46.780 --> 11:47.780]  the same.
[11:47.780 --> 11:49.580]  I was growing 12 different strains.
[11:49.580 --> 11:54.060]  They all tasted like strawberry bubble gum because of the nutrients that I was using.
[11:54.060 --> 11:55.820]  I'm pretty sure that it was that one bottle.
[11:55.820 --> 11:58.580]  A couple of the bottles made it all taste like bubble gum, but there was one, their
[11:58.580 --> 12:03.380]  Bloom Booster, really made everything taste like this strawberry bubble gum flavor.
[12:03.380 --> 12:07.020]  Why am I going to grow 12 different strains if it's all going to taste like strawberry
[12:07.020 --> 12:08.020]  bubble gum?
[12:08.020 --> 12:10.540]  I should have just grown a whole bunch of one thing and monocropped it.
[12:10.540 --> 12:12.380]  I didn't get any variation.
[12:12.380 --> 12:13.620]  Does it taste the way that you want?
[12:13.620 --> 12:15.300]  That's something that I noticed.
[12:15.300 --> 12:16.300]  You're going to see colors.
[12:16.300 --> 12:17.300]  You're going to see flavor.
[12:17.300 --> 12:18.300]  You're going to get flavors.
[12:18.300 --> 12:19.300]  You're going to get aromas.
[12:19.300 --> 12:22.540]  You're going to get size and some nutrients will grow more leaf.
[12:22.540 --> 12:24.300]  Some nutrients will grow more bud mass.
[12:24.300 --> 12:27.340]  Some nutrients I've noticed make the plants a little more robust.
[12:27.340 --> 12:32.340]  I'm not going to name any brands, but some brands will just give you a lot of fat buds,
[12:32.340 --> 12:33.700]  but a lot of fat leaves.
[12:33.700 --> 12:38.020]  Some brands will give you big robust stalks and hardly any buds.
[12:38.020 --> 12:40.980]  I've learned this from just growing and experience with nutrients over time.
[12:40.980 --> 12:43.780]  It's all about what works best for you with your results.
[12:43.780 --> 12:50.700]  Also, these results will be very grower specific, room specific, strain specific, environment
[12:50.700 --> 12:51.780]  specific.
[12:51.780 --> 12:56.860]  Everything else will fall into effect, into play here in this.
[12:56.860 --> 12:57.860]  It's a chess board.
[12:57.860 --> 12:58.860]  It's a whole chess board.
[12:58.860 --> 12:59.860]  Yeah, it's 64 squares.
[12:59.860 --> 13:04.260]  You got to get all 64 squares right, but every one of those will make a difference in your
[13:04.260 --> 13:06.280]  results, not just the nutrients.
[13:06.280 --> 13:10.740]  Let me stay focused here because I am quite dabbed and I'm trying to read these notes.
[13:10.740 --> 13:11.740]  We've got availability.
[13:11.740 --> 13:12.740]  Can you get these nutrients?
[13:12.740 --> 13:14.860]  Do you have to have them shipped to you?
[13:14.860 --> 13:17.860]  Maybe think about are you getting powdered or liquid nutrients?
[13:17.860 --> 13:20.540]  If you're getting them shipped, do you want to ship water?
[13:20.540 --> 13:24.820]  Because liquid nutrients are probably 70 to 99% water.
[13:24.820 --> 13:28.380]  If you choose to buy powdered nutrients, all you're paying for at that rate is the powdered
[13:28.380 --> 13:29.380]  nutrients.
[13:29.380 --> 13:30.900]  You're not shipping water across the country.
[13:30.900 --> 13:32.280]  They're more cost effective.
[13:32.280 --> 13:35.260]  You do need to use a scale to weigh those, which I don't mind doing anyway.
[13:35.260 --> 13:36.760]  I'm using a scale half the day anyway.
[13:36.760 --> 13:40.300]  Use a scale, weigh those powdered nutrients, mix them into the water, stir them up.
[13:40.300 --> 13:41.300]  Super easy.
[13:41.620 --> 13:42.780]  Are they available?
[13:42.780 --> 13:43.900]  Are they cost effective?
[13:43.900 --> 13:44.900]  Are they sustainable?
[13:44.900 --> 13:49.020]  Are they compatible with your growth style, your plants, and each other?
[13:49.020 --> 13:53.180]  And then most importantly, do you get results that make you happy?
[13:53.180 --> 13:56.340]  That is the very most important part is the results.
[13:56.340 --> 13:58.700]  Now let's go a little bit deeper into this.
[13:58.700 --> 14:00.740]  Do you want to work with organics?
[14:00.740 --> 14:02.340]  Do you want to work with salts?
[14:02.340 --> 14:04.080]  How organic do you want to go?
[14:04.080 --> 14:05.820]  How scientific do you want to go?
[14:05.820 --> 14:06.820]  That is up to you.
[14:06.820 --> 14:11.280]  There are plenty of brands that do offer organic products and plenty of brands that offer completely
[14:11.520 --> 14:13.000]  non-organic products.
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.360]  It's up to you how hippy dippy you want to go, how organic you want to go.
[14:17.360 --> 14:20.440]  One thing I always remind people when they say, I have to grow organically.
[14:20.440 --> 14:22.200]  This has to be completely organic.
[14:22.200 --> 14:27.680]  I remind them that cyanide is organic and a little bit of cyanide will fucking kill
[14:27.680 --> 14:28.680]  you.
[14:28.680 --> 14:30.720]  So are you that hung up on the word organic?
[14:30.720 --> 14:32.760]  A lot of times it is a buzzword.
[14:32.760 --> 14:37.860]  It makes things more expensive and it's unnecessary a lot of the times in my opinion.
[14:37.860 --> 14:41.580]  If you want to be organic, if you think that organic is the way to go, I am not here to
[14:41.580 --> 14:42.580]  argue that.
[14:42.580 --> 14:45.180]  I am here to help you select what is best for you.
[14:45.180 --> 14:46.180]  I'm trying to stay unbiased.
[14:46.180 --> 14:50.780]  I'm trying to give you information and educate without pitching any brands or any products
[14:50.780 --> 14:53.180]  because that bugs me when shows do that.
[14:53.180 --> 14:56.180]  I recommend you buy this and then they do a commercial for it right at the end of the
[14:56.180 --> 14:59.220]  show and you're like, well that's why you recommended it because they paid you money.
[14:59.220 --> 15:00.220]  That sucks.
[15:00.220 --> 15:01.940]  Anyway, do you want to go organics?
[15:01.940 --> 15:02.940]  Do you want to go salt?
[15:02.940 --> 15:03.980]  Do you want to be hippy dippy?
[15:03.980 --> 15:07.900]  If you're running organics and you add synthetic shit into your mix, you are no longer organic.
[15:07.900 --> 15:09.940]  You can't say organic at all.
[15:09.940 --> 15:10.940]  You have not yet.
[15:10.940 --> 15:12.500]  Non-organic is what that is.
[15:12.500 --> 15:15.620]  Any of the words that you made up to be a combo of those is not accurate.
[15:15.620 --> 15:16.620]  Organic means organic.
[15:16.620 --> 15:20.180]  Once you put shit that's not organic in it, you are now non-organic.
[15:20.180 --> 15:21.180]  That's all that is.
[15:21.180 --> 15:22.180]  So quit making up new words for that.
[15:22.180 --> 15:23.180]  I disagree.
[15:23.180 --> 15:25.580]  You can call it whatever you want, but it's not organic anymore.
[15:25.580 --> 15:26.580]  All right.
[15:26.580 --> 15:27.580]  How about cost effective?
[15:27.580 --> 15:28.580]  Can you afford it?
[15:28.580 --> 15:29.580]  We've already talked a little bit about that.
[15:29.580 --> 15:30.740]  Liquid or dry.
[15:30.740 --> 15:32.780]  We don't want to ship water across the country.
[15:33.020 --> 15:34.820]  Maybe some of you do.
[15:34.820 --> 15:36.420]  Maybe you want a lot of bottles.
[15:36.420 --> 15:37.620]  Maybe you want a few bottles.
[15:37.620 --> 15:41.060]  There are some companies out there that will sell you 30 bottles.
[15:41.060 --> 15:43.380]  There's one company that sells you three bottles.
[15:43.380 --> 15:46.820]  I've seen great results from both brands.
[15:46.820 --> 15:49.500]  It's kind of all about what you are into.
[15:49.500 --> 15:52.180]  How much do you want to mix?
[15:52.180 --> 15:54.500]  How much OCD do you want to have over this?
[15:54.500 --> 15:57.780]  How much control do you really want over the feet of your plants?
[15:57.780 --> 16:01.980]  The three bottles generally work as like you got a base and you got something, a microbe,
[16:01.980 --> 16:05.580]  and then you got a bloom booster and they just tell you feed this much of each one.
[16:05.580 --> 16:08.620]  Start with your base and then you start add microbes and they cut out the microbes, add
[16:08.620 --> 16:09.940]  bloom booster.
[16:09.940 --> 16:10.940]  That will work.
[16:10.940 --> 16:11.940]  Your plants will be great.
[16:11.940 --> 16:16.140]  There are other companies that want you to feed these two bottles on week one, this bottle
[16:16.140 --> 16:20.060]  on this bottle on week two, these four bottles on week three, these seven bottles on week
[16:20.060 --> 16:24.900]  four, these five bottles on week five, these nine bottles plus these two powders on week
[16:24.900 --> 16:26.100]  six.
[16:26.100 --> 16:28.260]  There's companies that want you to do all kinds of shit.
[16:28.260 --> 16:30.580]  It is up to you what you want to choose.
[16:30.580 --> 16:33.700]  Find a company like I said that you trust, you enjoy their ethics.
[16:33.700 --> 16:37.060]  A lot of the time, before I ever grew weed, I was reading magazines, I was looking at
[16:37.060 --> 16:38.060]  the internet.
[16:38.060 --> 16:42.140]  I don't even think there was the internet when I was dreaming about growing weed.
[16:42.140 --> 16:46.660]  I was looking at magazines and I would see brands and they would be advertising and some
[16:46.660 --> 16:49.180]  of those brands would speak to me and some of them would not.
[16:49.180 --> 16:52.260]  You're probably already drawn to a brand.
[16:52.260 --> 16:56.380]  There's already probably a logo, a company, somebody said something, you heard something
[16:56.380 --> 16:57.900]  that has got your attention.
[16:57.900 --> 16:59.440]  Now just think about that brand.
[16:59.440 --> 17:01.000]  Think about the ethics of that company.
[17:01.000 --> 17:02.320]  Where do they spend their money?
[17:02.320 --> 17:03.920]  How many bottles do you want?
[17:03.920 --> 17:04.920]  You've already got an idea.
[17:04.920 --> 17:06.440]  Do you want to go a bunch of bottles?
[17:06.440 --> 17:07.980]  Do you want to go just a few bottles?
[17:07.980 --> 17:09.720]  This may really help with your decision.
[17:09.720 --> 17:13.440]  How much OCD and control do you really need?
[17:13.440 --> 17:17.240]  Let's move forward from that because I rambled on with that one.
[17:17.240 --> 17:18.720]  Sources and science.
[17:18.720 --> 17:22.200]  Where are these companies learning to make the nutrients?
[17:22.200 --> 17:24.960]  Who are the formulators and where are they getting their ingredients?
[17:24.960 --> 17:30.400]  Are they using high quality ingredients or are they using bottom shelf leftover ingredients?
[17:30.400 --> 17:34.480]  Find out where these companies are sourcing the ingredients that they are selling you.
[17:34.480 --> 17:37.880]  Now here is something I started rambling about earlier and I cut myself off because I wanted
[17:37.880 --> 17:42.160]  to get to it sort of here at the end, closer to the end of this rant.
[17:42.160 --> 17:44.840]  It is okay to mix and match nutrients.
[17:44.840 --> 17:48.160]  By that I mean you can use, and I'm just going to say names randomly here.
[17:48.160 --> 17:52.400]  I said I was going to avoid names, but you can use a botanic care base and then you can
[17:52.400 --> 17:57.640]  use new millennium additives or you could use a advanced nutrients base and botanic
[17:57.640 --> 18:03.720]  care additives or you could do that if you are careful to not overlap any of the elements
[18:03.720 --> 18:05.080]  within those bottles.
[18:05.080 --> 18:06.780]  Carefully read what you are feeding.
[18:06.780 --> 18:10.640]  We need nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, molybdenum, sulfur.
[18:10.640 --> 18:12.200]  There are a lot of things I could just go on listing.
[18:12.200 --> 18:17.180]  We need a lot of these things in our plants, but company A, advanced nutrients did not
[18:17.180 --> 18:20.560]  talk to botanic care and say, hey, we're going to put this in the base so you don't have
[18:20.560 --> 18:21.840]  to put it in the bloom booster.
[18:21.840 --> 18:23.600]  You don't have to put that in the other one.
[18:23.600 --> 18:28.160]  We don't know that this company didn't add shit to that that's already in this bottle.
[18:28.160 --> 18:32.960]  I'm sure that company A, if you buy all of their lineup, you're not going to overlap
[18:32.960 --> 18:37.000]  things because they know that this product has nitrogen, this bottle has phosphorus,
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.500]  this bottle has potassium, this bottle has all the other shit we need.
[18:40.500 --> 18:43.420]  If you go adding a bottle from another company, they didn't talk to each other.
[18:43.420 --> 18:45.480]  You might be doubling up on nitrogen.
[18:45.480 --> 18:49.840]  You might double up on phosphorus or potassium or anything else and then you do risk the
[18:49.840 --> 18:53.000]  opportunity of burning your plants.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  I'm going to get off on a side tangent here.
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.760]  A lot of people often ask me about PPMs and how much to feed the plants at what PPM level.
[18:59.760 --> 19:05.000]  I can't give you a PPM number because I don't know how many PPMs of each nutrient you are
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.920]  using in that mix.
[19:06.920 --> 19:12.120]  It is very plant specific when you get to the high PPM, high performance plant levels.
[19:12.120 --> 19:15.700]  You could feed the plants a thousand PPMs and they'll thrive.
[19:15.700 --> 19:21.260]  You could also feed them 2,500 PPMs and they will thrive if you give them the correct nutrients.
[19:21.260 --> 19:25.100]  If I gave them 2,500 PPMs of phosphorus, they will cook.
[19:25.100 --> 19:28.460]  If I gave them 2,500 PPMs of nitrogen, they will cook.
[19:28.460 --> 19:31.100]  It's got to be a balanced diet of the proper shit.
[19:31.100 --> 19:34.500]  Then you can go real high if you know what you are doing and you have not overlapped
[19:34.500 --> 19:35.500]  anything too critically.
[19:35.500 --> 19:38.620]  All right, I did get off on a side tangent there.
[19:38.620 --> 19:42.500]  What I was headed for is I would recommend instead of mixing and matching things while
[19:42.500 --> 19:45.840]  you are new, while you are learning your nutrients, while you are determining what
[19:45.840 --> 19:47.980]  works for you is I would pick a line.
[19:47.980 --> 19:50.580]  I would just pick whatever line you've been studying.
[19:50.580 --> 19:52.540]  Just choose one that is going to work for you.
[19:52.540 --> 19:55.700]  It's available, it's cost effective, it's sustainable.
[19:55.700 --> 19:59.260]  It's been getting your attention and we don't know the results yet.
[19:59.260 --> 20:00.380]  Your friends have had good results.
[20:00.380 --> 20:01.900]  That's probably a good way to measure that.
[20:01.900 --> 20:03.380]  So pick that line.
[20:03.380 --> 20:09.180]  Then I would get the base, the microbe, the bloom booster, the cow mag if you need it,
[20:09.180 --> 20:12.020]  and then see what else they offer because they all offer a couple of other different
[20:12.020 --> 20:13.020]  bottles.
[20:13.020 --> 20:17.460]  I would get as much of that line as you feel necessary or as fits your budget.
[20:17.460 --> 20:22.340]  Then I would water, I would feed that entire crop, that entire run with that line of nutrients.
[20:22.340 --> 20:26.580]  The only way to do a solid test is to go from beginning to end with that product.
[20:26.580 --> 20:30.660]  If you go adding in other shit, we don't know what worked because that is adding anomalies
[20:30.660 --> 20:33.540]  and then shit can, it's hard to determine what did what.
[20:33.540 --> 20:35.260]  So feed it with that one line.
[20:35.260 --> 20:36.300]  See what you like.
[20:36.300 --> 20:37.300]  Did it taste good?
[20:37.300 --> 20:38.460]  Did it give you enough weight?
[20:38.460 --> 20:39.460]  Did it smoke well?
[20:39.460 --> 20:40.460]  Was it potent?
[20:40.460 --> 20:45.500]  If not, either research the next line you need or find something to add to what is missing
[20:45.500 --> 20:47.860]  from the lineup that you have chosen.
[20:47.860 --> 20:52.620]  I do use a specific line, but then to that I also add another brand's cow mag and I add
[20:52.620 --> 20:57.560]  a couple of bloom boosters from another company and then I add another trichome and resin
[20:57.560 --> 21:00.140]  producer from a totally different company.
[21:00.140 --> 21:05.060]  So I'm mixing probably four or five, maybe five or six different companies feeds in over
[21:05.060 --> 21:06.420]  the course of flowering.
[21:06.420 --> 21:10.860]  But that is because I have started with one base and I learned them and I grew with that
[21:10.860 --> 21:14.740]  one base a lot and I said, well, if I give it too much of this product early, I get too
[21:14.740 --> 21:15.740]  much leaf.
[21:15.740 --> 21:17.420]  If I cut this out, it reduces my leaf.
[21:17.420 --> 21:21.540]  I get bigger, fatter buds and then I realized these buds could probably be a little fatter.
[21:21.540 --> 21:25.340]  So I added a bloom booster and then I realized, oh, I missed that one product that I was using
[21:25.340 --> 21:26.740]  before that would go well in here.
[21:26.740 --> 21:28.660]  So I added that and it worked really well.
[21:28.660 --> 21:33.300]  I've just done it by starting by running the original base several times, documenting my
[21:33.300 --> 21:38.300]  results, seeing what I desired and then adding one more product every run and documenting
[21:38.300 --> 21:40.740]  that and comparing it to previous runs.
[21:40.740 --> 21:41.740]  Is it better?
[21:41.740 --> 21:44.200]  Did I get more weight, more potency, more flavor?
[21:44.200 --> 21:48.340]  Is it better or did it, was it cost effective that I buy another bottle, feed it and not
[21:48.340 --> 21:49.340]  get shit out of it?
[21:49.340 --> 21:50.780]  Or did I see results?
[21:50.780 --> 21:52.360]  A lot of the times I'll see results.
[21:52.360 --> 21:55.740]  A lot of the times I'll just stop using a product altogether.
[21:55.740 --> 21:59.140]  Don't be afraid to switch up your nutrient a little bit per plant.
[21:59.140 --> 22:01.340]  These nutrients will be plant specific.
[22:01.340 --> 22:06.700]  Like I said earlier, this will be plant specific, room grower, phenotype specific.
[22:06.700 --> 22:10.660]  This will be very specific feeding to get dialed in perfectly for each plant.
[22:10.660 --> 22:11.780]  Don't be afraid to adjust.
[22:11.780 --> 22:15.420]  If you've got two totally different plants in the room, don't be afraid to adjust the
[22:15.420 --> 22:19.700]  feed a little bit for each plant because the plants do want different things.
[22:19.700 --> 22:21.860]  You've got to develop that relationship with the plant.
[22:21.860 --> 22:26.300]  So you've got to learn the plant and the nutrients and if you keep switching things up, it is
[22:26.300 --> 22:27.300]  hard to dial that in.
[22:27.300 --> 22:31.780]  So feed that one plant that same nutrients for at least two or three runs and see how
[22:31.780 --> 22:32.980]  they react together.
[22:32.980 --> 22:36.500]  Then start making minor adjustments each run after that.
[22:36.500 --> 22:41.380]  Maybe run six plants of the same strain and feed three one thing, feed three the other
[22:41.380 --> 22:42.580]  and feed three the other.
[22:42.580 --> 22:45.860]  Just minor adjustments, maybe a little more base nutrients, maybe a little more bloom
[22:45.860 --> 22:46.860]  booster.
[22:46.860 --> 22:47.980]  You know what you're looking for.
[22:47.980 --> 22:49.380]  That is a great way to experiment.
[22:49.380 --> 22:53.380]  But I do recommend locking in with one brand to start getting as many of their products
[22:53.380 --> 22:56.340]  as you can either afford or find necessary.
[22:56.340 --> 22:57.620]  I like to buy the whole damn lineup.
[22:57.620 --> 22:59.220]  If I'm going to do it, why leave anything out?
[22:59.220 --> 23:03.540]  Just get them all, get it going, feed them, see what happens, do it again and then make
[23:03.540 --> 23:05.020]  adjustments on that third run.
[23:05.020 --> 23:08.420]  If I want to add something, take something out, that's when I will make the adjustments.
[23:08.420 --> 23:12.420]  All right, the last two notes that I have on my sheet are run side by sides.
[23:12.420 --> 23:15.540]  If you think that one nutrient is doing really good and you think another one is doing really
[23:15.540 --> 23:17.880]  good, what's to stop you from growing?
[23:17.880 --> 23:21.740]  If you got a six plant count, do three plants of one and three plants of another side by
[23:21.740 --> 23:24.260]  side in the same room and keep it scientific.
[23:24.260 --> 23:28.140]  That way you can figure out which lineup really does work best for you.
[23:28.140 --> 23:32.160]  The last note that I've got is some things that work for me may not work for you.
[23:32.160 --> 23:34.020]  Some things that work for you may not work for me.
[23:34.020 --> 23:35.220]  Our grow rooms are different.
[23:35.220 --> 23:36.460]  Our plants are different.
[23:36.460 --> 23:39.460]  Our goals, our styles, our approaches are all very different.
[23:39.460 --> 23:42.260]  Even if they're very similar, they are still very different.
[23:42.260 --> 23:44.220]  What works for me may not work for you.
[23:44.220 --> 23:46.660]  What works for your best friend may not work for your worst friend.
[23:46.660 --> 23:49.040]  What works for your girlfriend may not work for you.
[23:49.040 --> 23:53.900]  Be open, be flexible and pay attention to the plants because overall, the plants are
[23:54.060 --> 23:55.060]  the boss.
[23:55.060 --> 23:59.140]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[23:59.140 --> 24:02.700]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there,
